[45:08] revelation of your word like we've never

[45:31] amen you may be seated just for a moment
[45:33] before we read the word
[45:37] it's good to be in the house of the lord
[45:39] it's good to have some of you all back
[45:40] with us
[45:41] good to see the magars back there today
[45:43] and and my brother joel is here and
[45:46] and um his family and um
[45:50] my wife had to stay home this morning
[45:52] melody had a little bit of a fever and
[45:54] normally we would
[45:55] disregard that but the times being what
[45:57] they are
[45:59] we wanted to be be careful with that and
[46:01] so they're at home watching this morning
[46:03] my brother sister white camp uh texted
[46:06] me this morning and
[46:07] and they need our prayers their backs
[46:09] are just really bad and
[46:11] they've suffered with that for a while i
[46:15] spoke with or texted several times with
[46:17] brother david this morning
[46:19] and in addition to asking brother joel
[46:21] to sing
[46:22] he's doing much better and
[46:26] yesterday was a little bit of a of a
[46:28] touch and go
[46:29] day in the morning uh early in the
[46:31] morning he had texted me and said that
[46:32] he was very sick and
[46:34] oxygen levels weren't good they were
[46:36] thinking about having to do something
[46:38] additional what they were doing they had
[46:39] him on a full oxygen mast and
[46:41] mask and they were trying to think about
[46:43] doing something additional to that and
[46:46] but during the day i got i began to get
[46:49] people praying i
[46:50] texted and called just about everybody i
[46:52] know to pray and
[46:53] and during the day as we were praying
[46:56] something happened and i believe that he
[46:58] took a turn for the better
[46:59] and it'll all be uphill from here and uh
[47:03] or downhill however you'd prefer that to
[47:04] be he may not be wanting to climb too
[47:07] many hills right now but
[47:08] but we thank the lord for that it could
[47:11] have been much worse but instead it
[47:12] turned for the better better and we
[47:14] thank god i believe it was a miracle we
[47:16] believe god still works miracles
[47:18] you believe that today amen
[47:22] amen and keep praying for sister mary
[47:24] white as well she's
[47:26] um a little bit sick as well and she's

[49:35] but don't forget the offering at the end
[49:36] of the service for brother david
[49:40] let's turn to job chapter 2 and verse 7.
[49:46] job chapter 2 and verse 7 aren't you
[49:48] glad to be able to be in the house of
[49:50] the lord this morning
[49:52] that's nothing to take for granted is it
[49:56] job chapter 2 and verse 7 it says so
[50:00] went satan forth from the presence of
[50:01] the lord
[50:03] and smote job with sore boils from the
[50:05] soul
[50:06] of his foot unto his crown
[50:10] and he took him a pot sure to scrape
[50:11] himself with all and he sat down among
[50:13] the ashes
[50:15] then said his wife unto him dost thou
[50:17] still retain thine integrity curse god
[50:20] and die
[50:22] he said unto her thou speakest as one of
[50:24] the foolish women speaketh
[50:26] what shall we receive good at the hand
[50:28] of god shall we not receive evil
[50:30] and all this did not job sin with his
[50:34] lips
[50:35] i'd like to title this this morning the
[50:38] worst
[50:39] year of your life it's kind of a downer
[50:42] isn't it
[50:43] we won't stop there the worst year of
[50:45] your life you may be seated lord that is
[50:47] blessing to the word
[50:51] when i get to heaven i i want to sit
[50:54] down across the table
[50:56] from job and mrs jobe
[50:59] because i believe she made it just my
[51:02] own personal opinion there you can take
[51:04] that for what it's worth
[51:06] i want to talk about life i want to talk
[51:09] to them about what was it like to go
[51:12] through
[51:13] what they went through all of us have
[51:15] been through
[51:16] things but they had a bad
[51:19] year a really bad year
[51:24] i'm sure if we have a memory of the
[51:26] things that
[51:27] that have happened here i don't know
[51:29] that we will in that way but
[51:31] if i'm sure if we do that they will both
[51:33] say that that was the worst
[51:35] year of our lives
[51:39] let's look at what they had to deal with
[51:40] i want to look this morning
[51:42] at job because job didn't do anything
[51:46] to deserve the condition that he found
[51:48] himself in
[51:50] his conduct was absolutely
[51:53] right and there's not a whole lot of men
[51:55] that you could say that about
[51:57] not a whole lot of people today that you
[52:00] could say that about but there was a man
[52:02] job and one there was a man in the land
[52:04] of us and that's actually in
[52:06] northern arabia and and it's interesting
[52:10] as we'll stop there for a minute that
[52:12] all of the afflictions that job suffered
[52:14] would not have been uncommon
[52:16] to that part of the country if you look
[52:19] at what happened the wind and the
[52:21] and the different things that the fire
[52:23] and and the raiders that come through
[52:25] those are all things that would happen
[52:27] but with job they all multiplied they
[52:30] all happened at once
[52:33] and so it was uh it was a time but none
[52:36] of the trials that we have are uncommon
[52:37] to mankind all of them
[52:39] are experienced by someone somewhere
[52:41] else the thing is
[52:43] being a good man being a man who's even
[52:46] trusting in christ and believing god a
[52:48] believer in the message of the hour
[52:50] a believer in the opening of the word
[52:52] you might say a person who
[52:53] who trusts god completely doesn't
[52:56] exclude you
[52:57] from a trial right it doesn't keep you
[53:00] from going through
[53:01] some horrible things you could go
[53:04] through anything anybody else can go
[53:05] through
[53:06] but there's something about the
[53:07] christian you have something to fall
[53:10] back on
[53:11] you may get sick but you have a healer
[53:13] you may have trials but you have a
[53:15] deliverer
[53:17] you may you may go right down to the
[53:20] point of death but you have a god who
[53:22] has overcome death
[53:25] so now all our trials are common to
[53:28] mankind but
[53:29] this man's name was job and it says that
[53:31] man was perfect
[53:32] and upright one that feared god
[53:36] and eschewed evil that perfect and
[53:37] upright is complete as to his mind and
[53:40] heart
[53:40] straight or correct as to his moral
[53:43] department
[53:44] perfect and this doesn't mean he was
[53:46] legally or exactly perfect
[53:48] because we know that jesus christ was
[53:50] the only perfect man
[53:53] but what it means is that and brother
[53:55] branham uh put it this way that
[53:57] that he followed all the commandments of
[54:00] god to the letter
[54:02] that's a pretty good man
[54:05] now but he wasn't maybe legally perfect
[54:08] but but he had a sacrifice
[54:10] that he had made and but his intentions
[54:12] were right
[54:14] his affections his his heart was in the
[54:16] right place
[54:18] he tried to do the right thing at all
[54:20] times and so in his dealings with men
[54:23] he had an unblameable lifestyle he was
[54:26] one who
[54:26] who feared god who who was devoted to
[54:28] god who avoided sin
[54:30] and even the appearance of evil so he
[54:33] was a man who stood before god
[54:35] blameless when it comes to those things
[54:39] and he had the same testimony before god
[54:42] as he did before man in job one and
[54:44] eight
[54:44] it said the lord said unto satan hath
[54:45] thou considered my servant job
[54:48] that there is none like him in the earth
[54:52] all of us like to be nominated for
[54:54] something don't we
[54:56] you imagine when god begins to nominate
[54:59] job
[55:00] for being the most the best man on the
[55:01] earth you don't think that'll make the
[55:03] devil mad
[55:05] you don't think that will make the devil
[55:06] want to attack you when god stands there
[55:08] and begins to brag on you says ha shall
[55:10] consider
[55:10] my servant job there is none like him in
[55:12] the earth a perfect and an upright man
[55:14] one that feareth god
[55:15] and his jewish evil notice his testimony
[55:18] that he had with god was the same
[55:19] testimony that he had with man
[55:23] wasn't different now
[55:26] brother branham said it this way he said
[55:27] god said he's a perfect servant
[55:30] there's none in the earth like him
[55:32] there's nobody like job he's a perfect
[55:34] man
[55:35] he says it like this he said now he's my
[55:37] pride
[55:38] and joy you say it this way job was
[55:42] god's favorite person
[55:45] he's the one he bragged on if god could
[55:49] put it like a man a man with your
[55:50] partiality god doesn't do that but
[55:52] he said he's my pride and joy again
[55:55] brother brown said he said
[55:56] have you considered my servant job he's
[55:57] a perfect man there's nobody in the
[55:59] earth like him god was pleased with that
[56:02] he said oh he just loves to have a
[56:04] servant that he can trust in
[56:08] don't you want that to be your testimony
[56:10] today to be a servant that god can trust
[56:13] because god knows what you're going to
[56:15] do he knows you won't surprise him by
[56:18] any of your conduct
[56:19] and i said lord i want to be one that
[56:21] you can trust today
[56:23] i want to be one that you can trust with
[56:24] your word i want to be one
[56:26] that you can trust with the message of
[56:28] the hour you can trust with the
[56:29] revelation
[56:30] that's been given in this hour and so he
[56:33] loves to have a servant that he can
[56:34] trust in
[56:35] he said there's not another man on earth
[56:37] like him
[56:38] he said he is a perfect man and he said
[56:41] that was before the blood of jesus
[56:42] christ was shed
[56:44] and he said he's a perfect man he's just
[56:46] he's upright there is
[56:47] none like him brother branham tells us
[56:51] as i said that job carried out the
[56:52] commandments of god to the letter
[56:54] and that he was the best man that god
[56:56] had
[56:59] we were given an example of job's
[57:01] conduct before he went through his trial
[57:04] if you go down to job one and two it
[57:06] says they were born unto him seven sons
[57:08] and three daughters
[57:09] and his substance also was seven
[57:11] thousand sheep and three thousand camels
[57:13] five hundred yoke of ox and five hundred
[57:15] she asses in a very great household so
[57:17] that this man
[57:19] was the greatest of all the men of the
[57:20] east
[57:22] and his sons went and feasted in their
[57:24] houses every one his day and sent and
[57:26] called for their three sisters
[57:27] to eat and to drink with them and it was
[57:30] so when the days of their feasting were
[57:32] gone about
[57:33] job sent and sanctified them and rose up
[57:35] early in the morning
[57:36] i love this rose up early in the morning
[57:39] and offered burnt offerings according to
[57:41] the number of them all
[57:43] for job said it may be that my sons have
[57:46] sinned
[57:46] and cursed god in their hearts thus did
[57:49] job
[57:51] continually look at the kind of man that
[57:54] he was
[57:55] being a good man brother man said
[57:57] believing in god the only way that he
[57:59] had to come was through the burnt
[58:00] offering
[58:02] he said through the shedding of the
[58:03] blood of the lamb and he had several
[58:05] sons and daughters and when he seen that
[58:07] his sons and daughters
[58:08] he didn't know now him being a man that
[58:10] could afford to buy them things
[58:11] such as young folks would want see
[58:13] that's a double-edged sword
[58:15] the fact that we live in a country we're
[58:17] able to buy things that could be a
[58:18] double-edged sword
[58:20] because there was a reason his children
[58:21] were able to visit each other every day
[58:24] and have feasts there's a reason for
[58:26] that because they had plenty
[58:28] his kids never had to work a day in
[58:30] their life if they didn't want to
[58:31] because job was a rich man
[58:35] but look what it did it made him want to
[58:37] party it made him want to have these
[58:38] feasts and
[58:39] but job being a good man he said now
[58:42] i got to do something about that i got
[58:44] to make sure that they're right with god
[58:47] now he said he didn't know whether
[58:49] they'd sinned or not
[58:50] but he said prayer adventure they might
[58:52] have sinned i'm going to offer a
[58:54] sacrifice for them
[58:56] because that's the only thing i know to
[58:57] do is to present before god
[59:00] the shed blood of the lamb remember his
[59:03] children must
[59:04] have been grown or nearly grown and so
[59:06] he couldn't
[59:07] they were out of his hands
[59:11] there was a real lesson here for parents
[59:13] they were out of his hands he had to
[59:15] be willing to trust god with them but
[59:18] just in case
[59:20] i'm not going to abdicate my
[59:21] responsibility as a parent what am i
[59:23] going to do
[59:24] i'm going to offer a sacrifice i'm going
[59:26] to go before god with them
[59:28] even though they're older even though
[59:29] they're at a place where
[59:31] where they can do their own thing and
[59:33] they can go their own way i'm still
[59:35] going to make sure that my prayer life
[59:37] stays up
[59:39] i'm going to keep praying for them now
[59:41] look
[59:42] he said adventure they might have sinned
[59:45] i don't know what they have but to make
[59:46] sure
[59:47] he said mothers you know
[59:51] i think i've skipped ahead a little bit
[59:53] he said oh if we had more fathers and
[59:55] mothers tonight so interested in their
[59:56] children
[59:57] that would offer the shed blood of the
[59:59] lamb for their child
[1:00:00] every night at the throne of grace he
[1:00:03] said we wouldn't have so much carrying
[1:00:04] on as we have amongst young folks
[1:00:07] so he said prayer adventure they might
[1:00:08] have sinned i don't know they have
[1:00:10] but to make sure he said mothers you
[1:00:12] know it's a shame today and fathers
[1:00:15] how uninterested we are in children and
[1:00:18] the little juveniles
[1:00:20] he said you let the kids go out just do
[1:00:21] as they please running out all night
[1:00:23] long and everything come in
[1:00:24] seem to be so unconcerned about it he
[1:00:26] said but there's nothing i can do
[1:00:29] brother tim timothy pruitt told me a
[1:00:31] story one time he said
[1:00:32] he got to an age where he wasn't really
[1:00:33] serving the lord and he got old enough
[1:00:35] to drink
[1:00:36] and his father brother tim told him he
[1:00:38] said you know he said i can't keep you
[1:00:40] from drinking
[1:00:41] if you decide to go down to the bar you
[1:00:43] can go he said if i promise you this
[1:00:45] i'll be right beside you
[1:00:47] he said i'll sit there and pray and that
[1:00:50] meant a lot to me not just because it
[1:00:51] was with him although i believed he
[1:00:52] would do it
[1:00:54] and timothy told me that he believed he
[1:00:55] would too
[1:00:59] but you know there's something to that
[1:01:00] that that
[1:01:02] if you just let them go and say well god
[1:01:04] will take care of them
[1:01:05] now let me do my part you may go but
[1:01:09] it's not going to be
[1:01:10] because i didn't pray it's not going to
[1:01:12] be because i didn't reach out to god
[1:01:14] not going to be because i failed to make
[1:01:16] a sacrifice
[1:01:18] he said let your girls go out with boys
[1:01:20] to smoke and drink and go to gambling
[1:01:21] devices dance all night
[1:01:23] and come in he said you'd say you're a
[1:01:25] christians and permit such stuff as that
[1:01:27] that's not right
[1:01:28] he said we should take them to the lord
[1:01:30] and again we say there's nothing we can
[1:01:31] do but we can take them to the lord
[1:01:33] there's power in prayer brother david's
[1:01:36] the witness of that today there's power
[1:01:38] in prayer
[1:01:39] amen there's power in the people of god
[1:01:42] praying there's power in you as a parent
[1:01:44] praying for your children
[1:01:45] it says be waiting up for her to come in
[1:01:49] put your arms around her and say now
[1:01:51] sweetheart come here
[1:01:52] let's kneel down and pray mother don't
[1:01:55] know just where you've been trusting
[1:01:56] you've been a good girl tonight
[1:01:58] but prayer adventure that you haven't
[1:01:59] let's offer the sacrifice of praise to
[1:02:01] god
[1:02:02] and give him thanks he said i tell you
[1:02:04] you'd have a different children today if
[1:02:05] they did that
[1:02:06] we'd have more fathers like job see he
[1:02:08] said the trouble of it is mothers today
[1:02:10] would go with daughters out in such
[1:02:11] places
[1:02:12] and some of them belong to churches too
[1:02:14] he said that's just a little bit hard
[1:02:16] but you know that's what does you good
[1:02:18] he said now so then job said not to make
[1:02:20] sure that now to make sure of this
[1:02:22] i'm going to offer the sacrifice of the
[1:02:23] burnt lamb for each of my children
[1:02:26] if they have sinned he said that's the
[1:02:27] only way i can present them is upon the
[1:02:29] basis of the shed blood that's all we've
[1:02:31] got
[1:02:32] that's all we've got we you see each
[1:02:34] child might say well
[1:02:35] i've messed up i've i've done things
[1:02:37] that are wrong all i've got to offer is
[1:02:39] to shed blood
[1:02:41] that's all we've got come back to god
[1:02:43] you say i messed up
[1:02:45] don't don't leave church so i'll come
[1:02:47] back when i get better no
[1:02:48] come back to god now there's a sacrifice
[1:02:51] for you
[1:02:52] if you're willing to accept it if you're
[1:02:55] able to do it there's a blood for you
[1:02:57] if you're if you're willing to come and
[1:02:59] put yourself under the auspices of god
[1:03:01] there's a
[1:03:02] there's a place for you in the house of
[1:03:04] god don't quit coming to god
[1:03:06] we we want to offer a sacrifice for our
[1:03:09] children
[1:03:10] now look he said so that's the only way
[1:03:13] i can present them is upon the basis of
[1:03:14] the shed blood that's god's only plan of
[1:03:17] redemption through the lamb
[1:03:18] so i'm offering him i love this quote
[1:03:22] listen
[1:03:23] he said and did you notice when the
[1:03:25] fires come down and burn up all he had
[1:03:27] his children was all killed i imagine
[1:03:31] job thought
[1:03:33] oh i'm so happy and he wasn't happy that
[1:03:36] they
[1:03:37] died we know that because of how he
[1:03:38] mourned
[1:03:40] but he thought i i'm so happy because i
[1:03:43] offered the sacrifice for them
[1:03:47] oh he felt the loss of his children just
[1:03:50] as real as any other parent would
[1:03:52] all of them all 10 of them have won one
[1:03:54] day
[1:03:57] you can imagine that kind of a loss and
[1:03:59] the kind of a day that he had the kind
[1:04:01] of year that he had
[1:04:03] he said i'm so happy because i offered
[1:04:05] the sacrifice for them
[1:04:07] because i presented them before god
[1:04:09] through the shed blood of the lamb
[1:04:11] through god's provided way of redemption
[1:04:14] for my children
[1:04:16] they may have not done everything that
[1:04:17] was right but i offered a sacrifice for
[1:04:19] them
[1:04:20] amen are you glad you could still do
[1:04:23] that today
[1:04:27] job got in awful condition
[1:04:32] and it was satan that did it god doesn't
[1:04:35] bring sickness or
[1:04:36] those things on people but god allows it
[1:04:38] we find in job chapter one and verse six
[1:04:40] now there was a day when the sons of god
[1:04:42] came to present themselves before the
[1:04:44] lord and satan came also among them
[1:04:46] and the lord said to the satan wins
[1:04:47] cometh down and satan answered the lord
[1:04:50] and said from going to and fro in the
[1:04:52] earth and from walking up and down in it
[1:04:55] the bible says he goes about like a
[1:04:57] roaring lion seeking whom he may devour
[1:05:01] lord said to the satan has so considered
[1:05:02] my servant job
[1:05:04] there's none like him in the earth a
[1:05:05] perfect and an upright man
[1:05:07] one that feareth god and it's jewish the
[1:05:09] evil and if job could talk right now
[1:05:12] he'd probably say lord why'd you have to
[1:05:13] brag on me so much
[1:05:17] but don't you realize the things he said
[1:05:19] about job he said about you today is the
[1:05:21] bride
[1:05:23] you're spotless amen washed in the blood
[1:05:25] of the lamb
[1:05:26] go and read what he said about you
[1:05:27] through a prophet an invisible union of
[1:05:29] the bride amen
[1:05:31] you never did it in the first place
[1:05:32] you've been washed sanctified cleaned up
[1:05:35] amen washed by the water the bleeding
[1:05:37] word don't you realize he said you're a
[1:05:39] perfect people amen
[1:05:41] you fear god you you stay away from evil
[1:05:44] you're a perfect people and satan has
[1:05:46] got
[1:05:46] gunning for you it's no wonder that he's
[1:05:48] come after you it's no wonder that he's
[1:05:50] come after this church
[1:05:51] it's not a strange thing peter said
[1:05:53] thinking of strange concerning the fiery
[1:05:55] trials that you've had to go through
[1:05:57] it's not strange because the devil's
[1:05:59] gunning for you
[1:06:01] why because god bragged on you in this
[1:06:03] age
[1:06:04] but he wouldn't have bragged on you
[1:06:05] unless he knew that you wouldn't give up
[1:06:08] he wouldn't have bragged on you unless
[1:06:09] he knew that you wouldn't give in
[1:06:11] he wouldn't have hey man he wouldn't
[1:06:12] have bragged on you unless he knew
[1:06:14] that you were a child of son and
[1:06:15] daughter of god
[1:06:17] he wouldn't have bragged on you unless
[1:06:18] he knew the condition of your heart
[1:06:21] hallelujah satan answered the lord and
[1:06:24] said that job fear god for naught
[1:06:26] has so not made a hedge about him about
[1:06:29] his house and about all that he has on
[1:06:30] every side
[1:06:31] that was blessed the work of his hands
[1:06:32] and the substances increased in the land
[1:06:34] listen we ought to thank god every day
[1:06:37] because like i said these things are
[1:06:38] normal things that happen
[1:06:40] cancer is in the land coronavirus all
[1:06:42] these things are in the land
[1:06:44] if you have your health today thank god
[1:06:45] for it if you've overcome thank god for
[1:06:48] it
[1:06:50] amen because that's all we can do is
[1:06:51] overcome because these are this is a
[1:06:53] condition of this flesh that we're in
[1:06:55] this flesh
[1:06:55] never takes a conversion but there's
[1:06:58] something on the inside
[1:06:59] he said greater is he that's in you than
[1:07:01] he that's in the world
[1:07:02] we believe that today amen now
[1:07:08] he says he put forth on hand now and
[1:07:11] touch all that he hath and he will curse
[1:07:12] thee to thy face
[1:07:14] and satan's no prophet is he
[1:07:19] you see satan's words don't have to come
[1:07:21] to pass
[1:07:23] are you with me satan's words
[1:07:26] fail it's a lie the bible says and the
[1:07:30] father of liars
[1:07:31] we shouldn't give them so much
[1:07:32] credibility every time we hear a
[1:07:35] negative report we we want to repeat it
[1:07:37] but satan's words
[1:07:38] fail but god's words
[1:07:42] are not like satan's then they're not
[1:07:43] even like yours or mine god's word don't
[1:07:46] fail
[1:07:48] amen and so he said put forth your hand
[1:07:51] touch all that he hath he will curse you
[1:07:53] to thy face and the lord said unto satan
[1:07:55] behold all that he hath to send thy
[1:07:57] power
[1:07:58] only upon himself but not forth on hand
[1:08:00] so satan went forth from the presence of
[1:08:01] the lord
[1:08:04] and again not only are god's best not
[1:08:06] immune from trials they're targeted for
[1:08:08] trials
[1:08:10] but i want you to notice as well that
[1:08:12] satan is bound to what god allows him to
[1:08:14] do he's a creature of permission
[1:08:18] and you find that a good example of that
[1:08:19] with the lying spirit in the school of
[1:08:21] the prophets he come up before god and
[1:08:23] said
[1:08:23] and volunteered said i'll be a lying
[1:08:26] spirit
[1:08:28] and you get that spirit around church
[1:08:29] sometimes they always volunteer to tell
[1:08:30] something
[1:08:32] tell a lie huh no preachers would get
[1:08:36] that spirit on them
[1:08:38] a volunteer to tell a lie and god's
[1:08:40] children are not to be that way
[1:08:42] the accuser of the brethren is the devil
[1:08:44] in case you're we're confused
[1:08:48] right the accuser of the brethren is the
[1:08:50] devil
[1:08:51] that's his job it's already filled you
[1:08:54] don't need to put in an application for
[1:08:56] it
[1:09:00] i don't mean to be harsh but that's the
[1:09:01] truth we don't need to accuse
[1:09:04] there is no need for me to accuse my
[1:09:06] brother no need for you to accuse your
[1:09:08] brother or your sister
[1:09:09] why because the devil's already doing
[1:09:10] that he's already before the throne of
[1:09:12] god continually
[1:09:14] day after day he's before the throne of
[1:09:15] god accusing you but don't you realize
[1:09:18] don't you realize that everything he
[1:09:20] says is a lie he's always volunteering
[1:09:22] to accuse the brother and so discord but
[1:09:24] even what god allows him to do
[1:09:26] works to the perfect will of god
[1:09:31] job loses everything
[1:09:36] not not in a year at first but in one
[1:09:38] bad
[1:09:40] day and you can go read the story but at
[1:09:43] the end of it in job 1
[1:09:44] 20. it says then job arose
[1:09:49] rent his mantle shaved his head
[1:09:53] and fell down upon the ground and said
[1:09:56] woe is me
[1:10:00] now he did some of that later right
[1:10:04] he did but he just lost everything
[1:10:08] and his first reaction is to grief
[1:10:13] and worship
[1:10:16] so you don't have to be in good shape to
[1:10:19] worship
[1:10:21] you don't have to be having the best
[1:10:24] year of your life you may be having
[1:10:26] the worst year of your life you may be
[1:10:28] having the worst
[1:10:30] day of the worst year
[1:10:33] of the worst decade
[1:10:36] but you don't have to be on fire and
[1:10:39] excited and jubilated to worship
[1:10:43] but true worship is when everything is
[1:10:46] wrong
[1:10:48] and you fall on your face
[1:10:51] i've lost everything in one day i'm
[1:10:54] still going to worship god if we'd come
[1:10:55] to the house of god like that
[1:10:57] wouldn't our services be different
[1:10:59] wouldn't our attitude be different if we
[1:11:00] come to god like that
[1:11:02] that every day i realize i go through
[1:11:04] trials i realize there's troubles
[1:11:06] i realize some of you deal with things i
[1:11:08] can't imagine how you get through the
[1:11:09] day
[1:11:10] some of you have pain and things in your
[1:11:12] life that i can't even imagine how you
[1:11:14] deal with it but don't you realize
[1:11:15] that even that is an opportunity for
[1:11:17] worship
[1:11:20] amen and he said naked came out of my
[1:11:23] mother's womb and naked shall i return
[1:11:25] thither
[1:11:26] god loaned me all these things he gave
[1:11:28] me all these things for a while
[1:11:30] the lord gave and the lord is taken away
[1:11:32] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:11:35] amen
[1:11:38] the jews it was so wrong for them to
[1:11:41] curse god that they didn't have a word
[1:11:43] for it
[1:11:44] they used a word a play on words and and
[1:11:47] wrote the word blessed but different
[1:11:49] punctuation with it where you knew they
[1:11:51] were
[1:11:51] it was an irony and because they didn't
[1:11:55] even want to say
[1:11:56] that someone cursed god the lord gives
[1:12:00] and the lord takes away
[1:12:01] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:12:05] and all this job sin not
[1:12:08] nor charged god foolishly there's some
[1:12:11] time that passes between chapter one
[1:12:13] and chapter two the jews say it's one
[1:12:17] whole year because
[1:12:18] it's at the time when the sons of god
[1:12:20] present themselves before god
[1:12:23] and it says in job 21 again there was a
[1:12:25] day when the sons of god came to present
[1:12:27] themselves before the lord
[1:12:29] and satan came also among them to
[1:12:30] present himself before the lord
[1:12:33] and the lord said unto satan from whence
[1:12:34] cometh sound satan answered the lord and
[1:12:36] said from
[1:12:37] going to and fro in the earth and from
[1:12:38] walking up and down in it
[1:12:41] you can imagine having that conversation
[1:12:43] if we can put it in our vernacular
[1:12:45] what you've been doing satan well i've
[1:12:47] been just around
[1:12:50] i've been going around the earth a
[1:12:52] little bit
[1:12:53] causing a war over here and a little bit
[1:12:55] of heartache over here
[1:12:57] trouble over here and sickness over here
[1:12:59] been just walking to and fro looking
[1:13:01] around
[1:13:02] see what i could do and god says
[1:13:06] well hey when you were down there
[1:13:09] when you were there did you happen to
[1:13:12] see my servant job
[1:13:15] he knew he had and god knew that it
[1:13:18] burnt the devil
[1:13:18] up because job had lost everything
[1:13:24] and the devil told god he'll curse you
[1:13:26] to his face and all he did was bless god
[1:13:28] and worship god
[1:13:30] and that burnt the devil up and so god
[1:13:32] says hey you've seen job lately
[1:13:35] he's still in church isn't he he still
[1:13:39] worships you doesn't he
[1:13:40] very bad i wonder if god says that about
[1:13:43] us sometimes
[1:13:44] they've been through a lot but they
[1:13:46] still love you don't they
[1:13:48] amen they can still clap their hands
[1:13:50] they can still raise their hands they
[1:13:52] can still worship
[1:13:53] they can they still read their bible
[1:13:54] they've been through a lot but they
[1:13:56] still love me
[1:13:58] amen amen he said there's none like him
[1:14:02] in the earth and he says all that he was
[1:14:03] he said he's still
[1:14:05] i love this and still
[1:14:08] amen this is the last sermon now
[1:14:10] preaching 20 20. let me tell you
[1:14:12] i think god could say that about us
[1:14:14] today we've been through 2020 we've seen
[1:14:17] what the devil can do you say is that
[1:14:19] the worst the devil can do i don't know
[1:14:21] i can't promise you the next year will
[1:14:22] be better we have no promise of that
[1:14:24] but i do know this if you made it
[1:14:26] through this year and you still
[1:14:29] you still serve god you still hold fast
[1:14:32] your integrity
[1:14:33] you still believe god you still believe
[1:14:35] he's a healer you still believe he's a
[1:14:37] savior let me tell you that's just an
[1:14:38] indication
[1:14:39] that no matter what the devil throws at
[1:14:41] you you're gonna make it all the way
[1:14:43] it may have been the worst year of your
[1:14:44] life but you still still worship god
[1:14:47] you still hold fast your integrity he
[1:14:49] said although thou movest me against him
[1:14:51] to destroy him without cause
[1:14:53] still he continues to hold his testimony
[1:14:57] and satan answered the lord
[1:14:59] and said skin for skin you don't give up
[1:15:02] easy does he
[1:15:04] yea all that a man hath will he give for
[1:15:06] his life
[1:15:08] why does satan say this he just throwing
[1:15:10] it out there no he knows people
[1:15:15] and the truth is we care about ourselves
[1:15:19] now that's just the truth we care how we
[1:15:22] look we care how we feel
[1:15:25] there's nothing wrong with that in
[1:15:27] itself
[1:15:30] we do care about ourselves we feel our
[1:15:33] own pain more than others
[1:15:34] the pain of others and satan knew that
[1:15:39] he said but put forth on hand now and
[1:15:41] touch his bone in his flesh and he will
[1:15:43] curse you to thy face he said make him
[1:15:45] sick
[1:15:47] and he won't serve you anymore
[1:15:50] the lord said unto satan behold he is in
[1:15:53] thine hand
[1:15:55] but save his life
[1:15:58] now i want you to know that there's no
[1:16:00] indication that job knew
[1:16:03] that god said save his life
[1:16:07] right there's no indication of that
[1:16:11] job doesn't know he's not going to die
[1:16:17] and you know i don't know some some
[1:16:20] people have probably never been that
[1:16:21] sick and
[1:16:22] i had never been this year was the first
[1:16:23] time i'd ever been that sick
[1:16:25] that i had that thought even though i
[1:16:26] knew it wasn't true
[1:16:28] but you have that thought i'm gonna die
[1:16:31] and some of you have been there you
[1:16:34] think
[1:16:35] this could take me out i i i might die
[1:16:38] with this
[1:16:39] and you get so sick and you know what my
[1:16:43] blessed heart my dad is going on now but
[1:16:44] he every time he got sick he wrote out
[1:16:46] his will
[1:16:48] and he lay on the couch and and right
[1:16:50] who was getting what he changed every
[1:16:52] time
[1:16:54] it was always a source of amusement to
[1:16:56] us kids because he just had a cold
[1:16:58] but then he ended up dying prematurely
[1:17:01] but
[1:17:02] but he did that for years and and but
[1:17:04] you have that thought those thoughts
[1:17:06] are with you that thought was with job
[1:17:08] so went satan forth from the presence of
[1:17:10] the lord and smote job was sore boils
[1:17:13] from the soul of his foot into his crown
[1:17:15] now
[1:17:17] head to toe he's sick
[1:17:22] in the amplified version that's so satan
[1:17:27] departed from the presence of the lord
[1:17:29] and struck job with loathsome boils
[1:17:32] an agonizingly painful source
[1:17:36] from the soul of his foot to the crown
[1:17:38] of his head
[1:17:42] now i think we tend to underplay the
[1:17:44] effect of the sickness remember it'd
[1:17:46] been a year since he lost everything
[1:17:50] he's still dealing with that but it
[1:17:52] doesn't really get him
[1:17:55] until he finds himself sick
[1:17:58] and he goes and sits on the ashes which
[1:18:01] is
[1:18:01] such a poetic picture he sits on the
[1:18:04] ashes
[1:18:05] of all the things that have gone wrong
[1:18:07] around him
[1:18:09] sits on the ashes of his life if we
[1:18:11] could put it that way
[1:18:14] and he's sick from the top of his head
[1:18:16] to the crown of his feet and he thinks
[1:18:18] he's going to die now you go and read
[1:18:21] the book of job
[1:18:23] job is thinking about death
[1:18:29] well i tell you what this is a shouting
[1:18:30] sermon this morning
[1:18:34] the worst year of your life and the
[1:18:35] preachers preaching about death but you
[1:18:36] know what
[1:18:37] if the lord carries every one of us will
[1:18:39] die
[1:18:42] it always stuck with me i read a story a
[1:18:44] news story about a girl that was in the
[1:18:46] twin towers on 9 11.
[1:18:48] and she's standing there and she's on
[1:18:50] the phone with first responders and
[1:18:52] they're
[1:18:52] talking to her kind of trying to keep
[1:18:53] her calm and at some point she realized
[1:18:56] she was on a floor that no one was going
[1:18:57] to get to
[1:18:59] and the fire was getting hotter and she
[1:19:01] made this statement she said i'm going
[1:19:02] to die aren't i
[1:19:05] and the truth is every one of us are in
[1:19:07] that condition
[1:19:08] we just don't know when
[1:19:12] death is a shadow that follows everyone
[1:19:16] but see for the christian death is not
[1:19:17] the end
[1:19:20] but job doesn't understand the
[1:19:22] resurrection like we do
[1:19:24] at that time so he doesn't have a
[1:19:28] revelation of this and so he's dealing
[1:19:31] with these thoughts of death
[1:19:33] now in job seven and one we get a little
[1:19:37] bit of an insight into job's condition
[1:19:39] both of his mind and his body
[1:19:41] he said is there not an appointed time
[1:19:42] to man upon earth
[1:19:44] or not his days also like the days of a
[1:19:46] hireling
[1:19:48] as a servant earnestly desireth the
[1:19:50] shadow as a hireling looketh for the
[1:19:52] reward of his work
[1:19:54] so am i made to possess months of vanity
[1:19:57] so it's like you're in quarantine nobody
[1:19:59] will talk to you nobody be around you
[1:20:02] right i'm made to possess months of
[1:20:04] vanity nothing going on
[1:20:05] where some knights are appointed to me
[1:20:08] when i lie down i say when shall i arise
[1:20:10] in the night be gone
[1:20:12] i'm full of tossings to and fro until
[1:20:14] the dawning of the day
[1:20:16] he couldn't sleep he said my flesh is
[1:20:19] clothed with worms and clods of dust my
[1:20:21] skin is broken
[1:20:23] and become lowsome my days are swifter
[1:20:26] than a weaver shuttle and are spent
[1:20:28] without hope
[1:20:34] he says later on in job 21 6 he said
[1:20:36] even when i remember
[1:20:37] i am afraid i don't even have good
[1:20:40] memories to dwell on
[1:20:42] because all i can think of is how i lost
[1:20:44] my children
[1:20:47] how i lost all that i had even when i
[1:20:50] remember i'm afraid
[1:20:52] and trembling taketh hold my flesh he
[1:20:54] said i can't take solace
[1:20:56] in the past
[1:21:00] modern doctors have studied job's
[1:21:01] condition
[1:21:04] over the years most have believed it was
[1:21:06] a form of leprosy
[1:21:08] i don't know what it was the bible
[1:21:10] doesn't tell us but
[1:21:12] a study recently identified it as
[1:21:14] something called chronic uremia
[1:21:16] basically his kidney shut down and that
[1:21:19] sounds like what it is
[1:21:23] in this condition job was dying now god
[1:21:25] knew he wouldn't die
[1:21:27] because he told satan don't kill him but
[1:21:30] that don't mean satan didn't try
[1:21:34] right satan gave him something he could
[1:21:36] die from
[1:21:38] but god said he's not going to die he
[1:21:42] bet
[1:21:44] job was was dying and i think he
[1:21:46] probably knew that
[1:21:48] he was so sick he wanted to die
[1:21:52] but he was scared to die
[1:21:55] and i believe that his mental condition
[1:21:56] contributed to his physical condition
[1:21:59] and i've looked at this in in kidney
[1:22:02] disease especially but you look at a lot
[1:22:03] of different diseases and
[1:22:05] anxiety and stress actually gives
[1:22:10] it either causes some diseases or it
[1:22:12] makes them worse
[1:22:16] and there i read this article that gold
[1:22:18] striving stress
[1:22:19] is linked to kidney function decline in
[1:22:21] african americans and the idea
[1:22:23] behind the article is that there are so
[1:22:25] many of them that can't ever get ahead
[1:22:26] in life
[1:22:28] that it causes the prevalence of kidney
[1:22:30] disease
[1:22:32] among them because they have this goal
[1:22:33] and they want to and i know some of you
[1:22:35] have suffered with that and i'm not
[1:22:36] saying
[1:22:37] that's what caused it but this is just
[1:22:39] food for thought
[1:22:40] but it's goal striving stress it's it's
[1:22:43] something that
[1:22:45] they try to reach for a goal and they're
[1:22:47] disappointed
[1:22:49] and the article says this stress related
[1:22:51] to not achieving one's life's goals
[1:22:53] was linked with a higher risk for rapid
[1:22:55] kidney function decline in african
[1:22:57] americans
[1:22:58] in an observational study that included
[1:23:00] 2630 participants from the jackson heart
[1:23:02] study
[1:23:03] those reporting high levels of goal
[1:23:05] striving stress versus low levels
[1:23:07] we're 60 percent more likely to have a
[1:23:09] rapid decline
[1:23:11] in kidney function now
[1:23:15] we had we've got a lot of medical
[1:23:17] information in the message of the hour
[1:23:19] do you ever think about that a lot of it
[1:23:23] because brother branham diagnoses a lot
[1:23:25] of illnesses
[1:23:27] no he wasn't a doctor so in 1951 brother
[1:23:30] brown says this about that
[1:23:32] specific condition and again i'm not
[1:23:34] saying that's what it was but
[1:23:35] but if it was here's something that
[1:23:37] could have caused it
[1:23:38] he said well sister dear he said i want
[1:23:40] you to accept me now as your brother and
[1:23:41] as god's servant
[1:23:43] he said you're suffering for some yes
[1:23:45] you are suffering with a real nervous
[1:23:47] condition
[1:23:48] that's due to a time past of menopause
[1:23:52] he said also for that you have a kidney
[1:23:54] trouble
[1:23:55] that causes a burning in the kidneys
[1:23:57] that you have that
[1:24:00] and he says in another another person in
[1:24:02] the message elijah he said one thing
[1:24:03] you're all nervous
[1:24:04] upset about something he said you're
[1:24:07] suffering with a kidney condition that's
[1:24:08] in your kidneys
[1:24:09] that is right isn't it sister he said
[1:24:11] god bless your heart honey don't worry
[1:24:13] now there's a prescription huh you went
[1:24:16] to your doctor and said doctor i'm sick
[1:24:20] you been going to the hospital i'm sick
[1:24:22] i can't breathe
[1:24:23] he writes your prescription said don't
[1:24:25] worry
[1:24:29] he said what am i going to do with that
[1:24:30] well do what it says
[1:24:32] if he told you go take poison you say
[1:24:34] here i go
[1:24:39] if he told you go down put something in
[1:24:40] you that's going to do more harm than it
[1:24:42] does good here i go right to the the
[1:24:43] window
[1:24:45] get my drugs right and i'm nothing to
[1:24:47] get upset but listen
[1:24:49] god said don't worry through his prophet
[1:24:52] now
[1:24:52] he said you believe now he said all
[1:24:54] upset still talking to this woman
[1:24:56] he said god kidney trouble he said
[1:24:58] probably what's making her have kidney
[1:25:00] trouble
[1:25:04] so i said don't worry because it was the
[1:25:07] cause of it
[1:25:08] and brother branham says this just in
[1:25:10] general about disease he said god don't
[1:25:12] want you to be frowning
[1:25:13] god wants you to be happy do we believe
[1:25:14] that today
[1:25:16] the human heart was made to be happy
[1:25:18] worry will cause cancer
[1:25:19] temper will cause cancer don't never be
[1:25:21] upset he said brother ben if you always
[1:25:23] kept that no i have it
[1:25:25] but let me tell you it'll bring you down
[1:25:27] if you don't
[1:25:29] it'll bring you down if you if you have
[1:25:30] temper all the time if you're angry all
[1:25:32] the time
[1:25:32] you gotta let go for you not for that
[1:25:34] other person
[1:25:35] you gotta let go of that for you because
[1:25:37] you're gonna kill yourself
[1:25:40] and affect people around you you've got
[1:25:42] to let go of these things because if you
[1:25:44] hold a grudge you don't affect that
[1:25:45] person
[1:25:46] it affects you if you have temper if you
[1:25:48] have worry
[1:25:49] they don't affect nothing you don't
[1:25:51] change a thing how many times have you
[1:25:53] ever taken a test of some kind
[1:25:55] a medical test or maybe a a written test
[1:25:57] of some kind
[1:25:58] and you worried about it all night the
[1:25:59] night before what good did the worry do
[1:26:04] nothing if anything it hurts you
[1:26:12] i want to look at job's wife for a
[1:26:13] minute because she gets a little bit of
[1:26:14] a bad rap
[1:26:16] but you remember job's wife went through
[1:26:18] everything job did
[1:26:20] except for getting sick in his b in her
[1:26:21] body but we're told that
[1:26:23] you know satan kept her alive for a
[1:26:24] reason
[1:26:27] because god didn't tell him he couldn't
[1:26:28] touch her but she was a part of job
[1:26:31] and there's no indication that job ever
[1:26:33] divorced her or she divorced him
[1:26:36] we just know they had problems in their
[1:26:37] marriage
[1:26:39] because when she should have been his
[1:26:41] best confidant
[1:26:43] and his cheerleader you know how your
[1:26:46] wife is
[1:26:47] and she'll always tell you my wife
[1:26:49] always tells me the sermon was good
[1:26:51] and that's not always true
[1:26:55] i finally got to where i asked my kids
[1:26:57] because they'll tell me the truth
[1:27:01] but your wife is a cheerleader that's
[1:27:03] part of what she does that's part of
[1:27:04] who she is and we should be for our
[1:27:06] wives as well but
[1:27:08] is why i said in him does that still
[1:27:09] retain that integrity
[1:27:13] she said he is in such a bad shape that
[1:27:16] she's kicked him out on the ash heap
[1:27:19] she won't even let him stay in the house
[1:27:22] and said does that still retain that
[1:27:23] integrity curse
[1:27:24] god and die the person who was closest
[1:27:28] to him
[1:27:29] become an instrument of satan but listen
[1:27:31] what job says
[1:27:33] he said unto her thou speakest as one of
[1:27:35] the foolish woman speaketh
[1:27:38] what shall we receive good at the hand
[1:27:39] of god shall we not receive evil
[1:27:41] and all this did not joke sin with his
[1:27:42] lips
[1:27:44] she had seen so much just trying to
[1:27:47] empathize with job's wife for a moment
[1:27:50] you say i wouldn't have done that try it
[1:27:52] sometime
[1:27:55] well i'd have been like job well i pray
[1:27:57] that you would i pray that i would
[1:28:00] but lose 10 kids in one day
[1:28:03] lose your social status and everything
[1:28:05] and your husband
[1:28:06] is sick it looks like he's going to die
[1:28:09] with a chronic disease
[1:28:12] and he even smells so bad you can't even
[1:28:14] have him in the house
[1:28:19] you can begin to get a little more
[1:28:20] empathy because she's been through a lot
[1:28:23] she's seen a lot and the truth is she
[1:28:26] wasn't called
[1:28:27] necessarily to go through what job went
[1:28:29] through
[1:28:30] god told satan have you considered job
[1:28:32] he said he didn't say have you
[1:28:33] considered job and his wife
[1:28:35] but she was what we might say is
[1:28:37] collateral damage
[1:28:41] but she's still job's life
[1:28:45] sometimes it's hard for us to understand
[1:28:47] this because we want to make
[1:28:49] the person bad as well as what they say
[1:28:52] it's part of what we do especially in
[1:28:54] politics today we we demonize people
[1:28:58] right and so if a person says something
[1:29:00] we want to make that person evil
[1:29:03] now i i don't want any part in that
[1:29:05] because personally i've been through
[1:29:06] that in my life i don't want any part of
[1:29:08] that
[1:29:10] just because you may be off a little bit
[1:29:12] or saying something that's not right
[1:29:14] there could be a lot of reasons for that
[1:29:17] you could be out of your head
[1:29:20] you might come after the service today
[1:29:22] welcome to me and say brother ben
[1:29:24] that was the worst job you ever did it
[1:29:27] wouldn't be out of the question that it
[1:29:28] was
[1:29:30] right you might be right about that you
[1:29:33] might come and say i just can't stand it
[1:29:35] why are you saying things like that
[1:29:38] and you know it might hurt me i don't
[1:29:40] say it wouldn't it might hurt me
[1:29:42] but i have to consider that it's not you
[1:29:44] speaking
[1:29:48] now the truth is sometimes we don't give
[1:29:50] enough credit to the collateral damage
[1:29:52] maybe you're going through something you
[1:29:54] don't realize this is causing damage in
[1:29:55] your home
[1:29:56] damaging your life and maybe they aren't
[1:29:58] anointed in a certain way like you are
[1:30:00] to deal with that
[1:30:02] we got to remember that as preachers
[1:30:05] just us being in the ministry brother
[1:30:07] allen by the steward
[1:30:08] but the staff just just being in the
[1:30:10] ministry
[1:30:11] causes damage to our families
[1:30:14] now that's just the truth now we can
[1:30:17] make that better we can do things that
[1:30:20] make that better
[1:30:21] i've had times lately where i've had to
[1:30:24] put things aside
[1:30:25] and spend time with my kids spend time
[1:30:27] with my family because they've had
[1:30:29] a hard year i can't say this is the
[1:30:31] worst year of my life a lot of good
[1:30:33] things have happened to me this year
[1:30:35] god gave me you wonderful people to
[1:30:36] preach to and and all the things that
[1:30:38] have happened we've
[1:30:39] done good things here at the church and
[1:30:41] we've held together no one's died
[1:30:43] praise god for that
[1:30:46] as far as here that was among us in the
[1:30:48] local church we've had a wonderful year
[1:30:51] but remember remember that not everybody
[1:30:54] experiences life the same way
[1:30:57] so i have to remember that for them it
[1:30:58] may not be all that it is for me
[1:31:01] are you with me now i'm not saying it's
[1:31:03] not but but stay with me for a moment
[1:31:05] you've got to consider people that are
[1:31:07] weaker than you are
[1:31:09] especially your wife sometimes people
[1:31:12] are broken
[1:31:13] joe's life was broken she was done with
[1:31:15] it
[1:31:16] doesn't mean she wasn't a child of god
[1:31:21] it doesn't mean that she wasn't god's
[1:31:23] she was sure job's wife
[1:31:27] and he wouldn't be in the kind of man
[1:31:28] that he was he wouldn't have married
[1:31:29] someone heathen
[1:31:32] are you with me she just had it
[1:31:36] she just wasn't in the category of joe
[1:31:39] she'd been through it
[1:31:40] but look how job deals with it he said
[1:31:42] you speak like a foolish woman
[1:31:44] he doesn't say you are a foolish woman
[1:31:46] and i take this brother branham over and
[1:31:48] over reminds us of that fact
[1:31:50] and he doesn't elaborate on it but over
[1:31:51] and over every time he reads this he
[1:31:53] said
[1:31:53] he said you speak like a foolish woman
[1:31:55] he didn't say you are a foolish woman
[1:31:59] sometimes people are used by satan for
[1:32:01] god's purpose and sometimes those people
[1:32:03] are close to us
[1:32:07] job's three friends are in that category
[1:32:11] it was they weren't bad people
[1:32:14] huh they were just being used by the
[1:32:16] devil to make jobs year worse than it
[1:32:18] was
[1:32:20] don't be a tool of the of the enemy
[1:32:21] today
[1:32:24] but sometimes people are broken now
[1:32:27] the sickness of jobs in his manner of
[1:32:29] grieving and if you if you
[1:32:31] read the book of job job isn't a good
[1:32:34] patient
[1:32:36] right and i think it's it's it's it's
[1:32:39] hilarious because later in the scripture
[1:32:40] and i've got it i think later
[1:32:42] in james he says we consider the
[1:32:44] patience of job
[1:32:46] job was patient but he got to a point
[1:32:48] where he just had to complain
[1:32:50] he wasn't going to curse god he wasn't
[1:32:52] going to give up but he just was just
[1:32:53] about to
[1:32:56] and he complains a lot and it's hard to
[1:32:59] live with a complainer
[1:33:02] that's right my wife knows that
[1:33:08] says shall we receive good at the hand
[1:33:11] of god shall we not receive evil and all
[1:33:13] this
[1:33:13] did not job sin with his lips
[1:33:16] he doesn't put her out he doesn't say
[1:33:18] woman you're not worth nothing to me he
[1:33:22] says you speak like a foolish woman
[1:33:24] in job 1907 we know that this had an
[1:33:26] estrangement caused an estrangement in
[1:33:28] their marriage because
[1:33:29] in job 1907 he said my breath is strange
[1:33:31] to my wife
[1:33:33] though i entreated her and treated for
[1:33:35] the children's sake of my own body
[1:33:37] you know and you know when you bring the
[1:33:38] children into the argument that it's
[1:33:40] getting pretty bad
[1:33:43] for the kid's sake honey love me care
[1:33:45] for me
[1:33:47] she said i don't want anything to do
[1:33:48] with you i'm tired of hearing you moan
[1:33:53] she may have been a good woman but she
[1:33:55] just couldn't take it
[1:33:57] job had to face this alone and some
[1:33:59] things we have to face
[1:34:02] alone bruno said joe back under his
[1:34:06] his great strain he said my everything
[1:34:08] took away from the devil said let me
[1:34:09] have him
[1:34:10] i'll make him curse you to your face and
[1:34:11] then he broke loose his wife even turned
[1:34:14] against him
[1:34:15] set a breath and become strange to him
[1:34:16] in other words she would have nothing to
[1:34:18] do with him she didn't seem to love him
[1:34:20] anymore
[1:34:20] just pushed him away job you're
[1:34:23] miserable why don't you just curse god
[1:34:25] and die
[1:34:25] he said you talk like a foolish woman oh
[1:34:28] my
[1:34:29] again brother brown says then he said
[1:34:31] don't you take his life
[1:34:33] and satan had done everything but take
[1:34:34] his life his children got killed his
[1:34:36] cattle was killed everything all his
[1:34:38] risks were lost
[1:34:39] he lost his health and everything but
[1:34:40] his life set out there and scraped his
[1:34:43] boils
[1:34:43] his wife comes the door and satan got in
[1:34:45] her and said thou
[1:34:48] looked out there and said why don't you
[1:34:49] curse god and die he said you look so
[1:34:51] miserable he said thou
[1:34:52] that was speakers like the foolish woman
[1:34:55] see now he's never said she was foolish
[1:34:57] said she talked like one i think all of
[1:35:00] us are guilty of talking like one now
[1:35:02] and then
[1:35:03] a foolish woman or a foolish man
[1:35:07] he said the lord gave and the lord taken
[1:35:09] away blessed be the name of the lord
[1:35:12] job never took the part of the devil and
[1:35:14] accused his wife
[1:35:17] even though she accused him james 5 11
[1:35:19] behold we count them happy which endure
[1:35:21] he said you have heard of the patience
[1:35:22] of job maybe some of that's just dealing
[1:35:24] with his wife brother danny
[1:35:27] your wife and my wife would never be
[1:35:28] like that we'd never have to deal with
[1:35:29] that because they're good
[1:35:30] godly women but the devil got on this
[1:35:32] woman caused her to say something
[1:35:37] it wasn't her it was the devil job had
[1:35:40] patience now look
[1:35:42] job had to come to a conclusion i'll
[1:35:44] bring this down to a close here in a
[1:35:45] little while
[1:35:47] give myself plenty of leeway there
[1:35:51] number one is how could a loving god
[1:35:52] allow him to suffer such loss
[1:35:54] he said well this is so uh
[1:35:57] elementary brother ben why can't you
[1:35:58] tell us something deeper if you don't
[1:36:00] get this you won't get nothing
[1:36:04] you're going to understand all you want
[1:36:05] to about the seventh seal about the
[1:36:06] opening of the word and all the things
[1:36:08] and
[1:36:08] i love preaching on those things but
[1:36:09] unless you understand how to deal
[1:36:11] with loss unless you understand why god
[1:36:15] doesn't treat you any differently than
[1:36:16] the world when it comes to that
[1:36:19] why you can get sick why unless you have
[1:36:21] an understanding of the
[1:36:22] of the character of god all this other
[1:36:25] stuff's not going to get you anywhere
[1:36:28] we count them happy which endure amen
[1:36:30] that ought to be us today shouldn't it
[1:36:33] amen so now
[1:36:36] job knew so that was the first thing
[1:36:39] that
[1:36:39] how could a loving god allow him to
[1:36:40] suffer such loss when he done everything
[1:36:42] he was supposed to do
[1:36:44] and secondly if a man could suffer such
[1:36:46] loss and tragedy during life
[1:36:48] if there was no resurrection what good
[1:36:51] did it do to him
[1:36:54] and i've dealt with this personally
[1:36:56] let's think on a big level now
[1:36:58] i've dealt with this because i've told
[1:37:00] you before when my dad was dying of
[1:37:02] cancer
[1:37:03] and i'm in there and what i wanted to
[1:37:05] happen at some point you begin to pray
[1:37:07] god to help him not to suffer
[1:37:09] because he was suffering so bad and i
[1:37:12] in my heart i questioned that i said god
[1:37:14] why does he have to suffer like that
[1:37:17] i understand him dying i don't know if
[1:37:20] it's time to go
[1:37:21] then we'll let go of him lord but why
[1:37:23] why does he have to suffer like that
[1:37:25] and the lord spoke to my heart and said
[1:37:27] if you if he didn't suffer like that you
[1:37:29] would never
[1:37:30] appreciate a place where there's no
[1:37:33] suffering
[1:37:36] if you'd never seen suffering like that
[1:37:40] or experienced suffering like that
[1:37:43] you wouldn't never be able to fully
[1:37:46] appreciate
[1:37:46] heaven heaven would seem boring
[1:37:50] because you've never experienced it but
[1:37:52] god allows every person to be touched by
[1:37:55] loss and suffering
[1:37:56] and tragedy
[1:38:00] because it helps us to look for a
[1:38:01] resurrection
[1:38:03] there's got to be something more than
[1:38:05] this these there's two scriptures that
[1:38:06] deal with these questions the first in
[1:38:08] romans 8 28
[1:38:09] he said we know that all things work
[1:38:10] together for good to them that love
[1:38:12] god and the way he says it's just so
[1:38:14] perfect because he said all
[1:38:16] things work together he didn't say all
[1:38:17] things were good
[1:38:19] but all things work together for good
[1:38:21] amen to them that love god to them where
[1:38:23] they're called according to his purpose
[1:38:25] in first corinthians 15 19 when paul
[1:38:27] says if in this life
[1:38:28] only we have hope in christ we are of
[1:38:31] all men
[1:38:32] most miserable
[1:38:35] at the end of the day no matter how
[1:38:37] pretty you make this life and how
[1:38:38] wonderful
[1:38:39] and how much faith you have and how much
[1:38:40] joy and all those things
[1:38:42] at the end of the day if we only have
[1:38:44] hope in this life we are more miserable
[1:38:46] than the person who just
[1:38:47] says eat drink and be merry
[1:38:51] but this life isn't it
[1:38:54] and suffering sometimes makes you
[1:38:56] realize that
[1:38:58] there's more to life than just what i
[1:39:00] experienced yes i can have a happy home
[1:39:02] yes i can have a a good church that i go
[1:39:04] to and enjoy the presence of the lord
[1:39:06] yes i can feel god's presence in my life
[1:39:09] i know
[1:39:09] i have joy in my heart but i know
[1:39:11] there's a better place somewhere
[1:39:13] i know that beyond the curtain there's a
[1:39:15] body waiting for me
[1:39:17] amen thank you lord
[1:39:21] job knew that god required an atonement
[1:39:24] we know that because he offered an
[1:39:25] atonement
[1:39:26] for his children so he must have offered
[1:39:28] one for himself
[1:39:30] that he would accept that god would
[1:39:32] accept a substitutionary offering
[1:39:34] and he had absolute confidence in that
[1:39:38] but there come a time when it had to be
[1:39:40] more than just
[1:39:41] putting away your sin but there's got to
[1:39:43] be something that'll get you to heaven
[1:39:46] amen and jobs complain if you go and
[1:39:48] read in the book of job he said if i
[1:39:50] could find him
[1:39:51] i'd talk to him i'd have it out with him
[1:39:54] if i could find him we'd have a case
[1:39:56] we'd start
[1:39:56] a court case i'd plead my case if i
[1:39:59] could talk to him
[1:40:00] if i could find where he was brother
[1:40:03] brown said see he held right to what he
[1:40:05] had
[1:40:06] now he was a prophet he said i'm not a
[1:40:08] sinner i have offered the provided
[1:40:10] sacrifice
[1:40:11] now who can say that today who's
[1:40:14] qualified to say that every person
[1:40:16] who's been born again of the spirit of
[1:40:17] god
[1:40:21] every person you say well you don't know
[1:40:22] what i did if you've been born again
[1:40:24] you don't go back to those things but
[1:40:27] you've been born again really born again
[1:40:29] now look you have a right to say that no
[1:40:32] matter what the others say
[1:40:35] were right at the word he said he was
[1:40:37] right there at the word he was on the
[1:40:38] word
[1:40:40] job knew brother brown says in in 1963
[1:40:42] job knew he wasn't a sinner
[1:40:45] he had met exactly every word god
[1:40:47] required that burnt sacrifice
[1:40:49] he said that burnt offering was all god
[1:40:51] asked for
[1:40:52] god only asked for the burnt offering
[1:40:54] amen brother branham repeats that you'll
[1:40:56] find in different places where brother
[1:40:57] branham says this
[1:40:58] that god only required to burn offering
[1:41:01] that's all he required
[1:41:02] if that's all he required job knew he
[1:41:03] hadn't sinned you see how simple that is
[1:41:07] amen and brother brown says god only ask
[1:41:10] you to believe his word
[1:41:12] how many believers do we have here today
[1:41:14] god only asks you to believe his word he
[1:41:16] didn't ask you to jump through hoops he
[1:41:17] said believe the word
[1:41:19] you don't ask all these isms and creeds
[1:41:20] and everything else he asked for you to
[1:41:22] believe him he
[1:41:23] believeth in me amen amen
[1:41:26] he begins to see there had been an
[1:41:28] antidote for death
[1:41:30] oh by something more than just a blood
[1:41:32] of bulls and goats
[1:41:34] look at him searching looking wondering
[1:41:36] is there something beyond
[1:41:37] death because i hear i see my own death
[1:41:39] staring me in the face is there
[1:41:40] something more than this life
[1:41:42] job 14 7 he said for there is hope of a
[1:41:44] tree if it be cut down that it will
[1:41:46] sprout again
[1:41:47] that the tender branch thereof will not
[1:41:49] cease though the root there of wax old
[1:41:51] in the earth and the stock there have
[1:41:52] die in the ground
[1:41:53] yet through the sin of water it will bud
[1:41:56] and bring forth both like a plant
[1:41:57] remember he didn't have a bible like we
[1:41:59] do
[1:42:00] he had to look at nature he looked at it
[1:42:02] and he said here's this nature
[1:42:04] that the seed comes up the sin of water
[1:42:07] but man dieth and wasteth away yay man
[1:42:11] give us up the ghost and where is he
[1:42:13] he says the waters fell from the sea and
[1:42:15] the flood decayeth and dries up
[1:42:17] so man lies down and riseth not
[1:42:20] till the heavens be no more
[1:42:23] they shall not awake don't be raised out
[1:42:25] of their sleep he said oh that that
[1:42:27] would has tied me in the grave
[1:42:29] that would just keep me secret until thy
[1:42:32] wrath be passed
[1:42:34] it's only in this time of suffering that
[1:42:37] he begins to recognize his need
[1:42:39] for a better life for a life beyond the
[1:42:43] grave
[1:42:44] oh that that would have tied me in the
[1:42:46] grave that thou would have keep me a
[1:42:47] secret
[1:42:47] until thy wrath be passed if that was to
[1:42:49] point me a set time and remember me
[1:42:52] verse 14 if a man dies shall he live
[1:42:54] again all the days of my
[1:42:56] appointed time will i wait till my
[1:42:58] change come
[1:43:00] listen to the revelation beginning to
[1:43:02] come he said thou shalt call
[1:43:04] and i will answer thee thou would have a
[1:43:06] desire to the work of thine hands
[1:43:10] see his loss taught him or something the
[1:43:13] fact that he missed those things that he
[1:43:15] had lost
[1:43:15] those people that he lost he said surely
[1:43:17] god if you're all-powerful
[1:43:19] if i've lost these things and i miss
[1:43:21] them surely if something is lost
[1:43:24] from the earth a life that you miss that
[1:43:26] i'm the work of your hands lord oh my
[1:43:29] it begins to see something job 19 and 18
[1:43:33] job he's going through this trial now
[1:43:35] this is right in the middle of it
[1:43:39] the worst year of his life he said yeah
[1:43:42] young children despised me i rose and
[1:43:45] they spake against me
[1:43:47] all my inward friends abhorred me they
[1:43:50] whom i loved are turned against me
[1:43:53] my bone cleaveth to my skin into my
[1:43:55] flesh
[1:43:57] i am escaped with the skin of my teeth
[1:44:00] what a horrible condition he is in he
[1:44:03] tells his friends he said have pity upon
[1:44:05] me
[1:44:05] have pity upon me oh you my friends for
[1:44:08] the hand of god hath touched me
[1:44:10] why do you yet why do you persecute me
[1:44:12] as god
[1:44:13] and i'm not satisfied with my flesh
[1:44:16] or that my words were now written oh
[1:44:19] that they were
[1:44:20] printed in the book when did he get this
[1:44:22] revelation
[1:44:23] when did he see the vision right in the
[1:44:26] middle of the suffering
[1:44:29] he never said i got better and then i
[1:44:30] saw a redeemer
[1:44:33] no it's right in the middle of the same
[1:44:35] chapter where he's talking about how
[1:44:37] how hard life is for him during that
[1:44:41] time
[1:44:42] he said oh that my words were not
[1:44:43] written know that they were printed in a
[1:44:45] book
[1:44:45] that they were graven with an iron pen
[1:44:47] led in the rock forever
[1:44:49] for i know that my redeemer liveth
[1:44:53] you don't see that in prosperity like
[1:44:55] you do in sickness
[1:44:58] you don't see that in well in a well
[1:45:00] body like you do when
[1:45:02] everything's gone against you and it
[1:45:03] feels like there's no hope at all and
[1:45:05] you feel something raising up in you
[1:45:07] that's when god begins to reveal to you
[1:45:08] who he is
[1:45:11] amen he said i know that my redeemer
[1:45:14] liveth and that he shall stand
[1:45:15] at the latter day upon the earth and
[1:45:17] though after my skin worms destroy this
[1:45:18] body
[1:45:19] yet in my flesh shall i see god amen
[1:45:22] remember it was his flesh it was all
[1:45:25] a bunch of sores encrusted over whatever
[1:45:27] sickness that it was
[1:45:28] it had made his flesh so corrupt but he
[1:45:30] said in my flesh
[1:45:32] hallelujah it may be i may be losing it
[1:45:35] may be eaten away by this disease but in
[1:45:37] my flesh shall i see god
[1:45:40] amen whom i shall see for myself mine i
[1:45:43] shall be holding not another
[1:45:45] though my reigns even my my inward being
[1:45:48] be consumed within me
[1:45:52] job wanted answers instead of answering
[1:45:55] his questions god gave him a vision of a
[1:45:57] redeemer
[1:46:01] because knowledge is not an absolute
[1:46:06] just reading the words doesn't give you
[1:46:08] an absolute
[1:46:10] but it's revelation of who he is
[1:46:14] that gives you a tie post
[1:46:18] job needed something not to tell him why
[1:46:21] he went through what he went through
[1:46:22] not to tell him like we have the
[1:46:24] hindsight is 20 20 we can look back and
[1:46:26] see what the inspired writer said
[1:46:28] about god being in heaven and giving
[1:46:29] permission to the devil and all those
[1:46:31] things
[1:46:31] job probably couldn't see none of that
[1:46:33] he probably didn't know any of that
[1:46:35] but he says i know my redeemer lives
[1:46:38] what did that tell him i know he's my
[1:46:40] god i know he's my redeemer and if he's
[1:46:42] my redeemer i'll be able to stand right
[1:46:44] there with him face to face
[1:46:48] job wanted answers but god gave him a
[1:46:50] vision of the redeemer he gave him an
[1:46:51] absolute
[1:46:53] and the message in absolute brother
[1:46:54] branham says christ death wasn't
[1:46:55] absolute
[1:46:57] it wasn't absolute it was the end of all
[1:46:59] fear
[1:47:01] to them that was scared of death his
[1:47:04] death is an absolute then
[1:47:07] but the brown says people fear death
[1:47:09] even job feared death but when he saw
[1:47:11] the vision
[1:47:12] he knew everything was gone his family
[1:47:14] his children even his wife had turned
[1:47:16] against him
[1:47:16] because his stench of his boils listen
[1:47:19] you may have gone through a hard time in
[1:47:20] your life but can you see the vision
[1:47:24] you don't need to get a vision of me you
[1:47:26] don't need to get a vision of this
[1:47:27] church you don't need to get a vision of
[1:47:28] some other church
[1:47:29] you need to get a vision of christ
[1:47:33] get a vision of christ the word christ
[1:47:35] your redeemer
[1:47:36] you can stay with job i know my redeemer
[1:47:39] lives i've heard about him but now i see
[1:47:41] him
[1:47:42] i have an absolute people fear death he
[1:47:44] said job feared death but when he saw
[1:47:46] the vision he knew everything was gone
[1:47:47] his family his children even his wife
[1:47:49] had turned against him because the
[1:47:50] stench of his boils
[1:47:54] amen he sat out of his house on an ashy
[1:47:56] scraping his walls and his wife even
[1:47:58] said why don't you curse god and die to
[1:48:00] death
[1:48:00] he said i'll speak it's like a foolish
[1:48:02] woman see then when elohim
[1:48:04] talked to him he said some of these days
[1:48:05] i want to break that name down for you
[1:48:07] elohim and show you is christ
[1:48:08] when he had this condition and
[1:48:10] everything was going against him when he
[1:48:11] saw the vision of the just
[1:48:13] one he wanted to find a man who could
[1:48:15] stand in the breach for him
[1:48:17] he put his head put his hands on a
[1:48:18] sinful man of the holy god and stand in
[1:48:20] the way
[1:48:21] and god let him see it four thousand
[1:48:23] years away it was his absolute
[1:48:25] he raised up and shook himself
[1:48:28] hallelujah
[1:48:29] he said when a man is scared of dying
[1:48:31] raise up and shake yourself
[1:48:34] amen look into the word see what the
[1:48:36] vision of god is
[1:48:38] said he's seen that vision he said i
[1:48:40] know my redeemer liveth and at the last
[1:48:42] days he'll stand up on this earth and i
[1:48:43] am
[1:48:44] tying myself to it oh don't you know
[1:48:46] that's what you need to do this morning
[1:48:48] tie yourself to the vision but i don't
[1:48:50] know what so-and-so is going to do tie
[1:48:51] yourself to the vision
[1:48:52] i don't know if i'll live or die tie
[1:48:54] yourself to the vision
[1:48:56] i don't know what's going to happen in
[1:48:57] the church tie yourself to the vision
[1:48:59] i don't know what's going to happen what
[1:49:00] if everybody leaves around the message
[1:49:02] tie yourself to the vision
[1:49:05] amen if everybody gives up i'm tied to
[1:49:07] the vision amen
[1:49:09] amen when a man is scared of dying raise
[1:49:13] up and shake yourself
[1:49:14] look into the word see what the vision
[1:49:15] of god is he sent that scene that vision
[1:49:18] he said i know my redeemer lives that
[1:49:19] the last days he'll stand upon this
[1:49:20] earth and i'm tying myself to it
[1:49:22] though the skin worms destroys this body
[1:49:24] yet in my flesh shall i see god
[1:49:26] whom i shall see for myself i'm tied to
[1:49:28] it he said he saw it it was a promise of
[1:49:31] god
[1:49:34] i'm closing musicians go ahead and come
[1:49:39] i've always wondered why job's vision
[1:49:41] didn't come
[1:49:42] at the end of the book that's always
[1:49:45] kind of seemed out of place to me
[1:49:48] why right in the middle of his
[1:49:50] complaints
[1:49:51] does he see a redeemer
[1:49:55] because you'd think it happened at the
[1:49:56] end when he right before he got restored
[1:50:00] you'd like to think that it happened
[1:50:01] that he saw the redeemer and instantly
[1:50:03] everything was good
[1:50:06] his kids he got his kids were
[1:50:10] giving back to him all his his cattle
[1:50:12] all of his wealth
[1:50:14] no that's the end of the story job's
[1:50:17] only halfway through his trial
[1:50:20] i can't tell you when the end will be i
[1:50:21] don't know it could be today
[1:50:25] maybe like brother david yesterday maybe
[1:50:26] that'll be the end of the beginning
[1:50:29] maybe that'll be the time when things
[1:50:31] turn around for him i trust that it was
[1:50:33] i believe that it was but look you don't
[1:50:36] know what tomorrow holds none of us do
[1:50:38] the healthiest person in here could
[1:50:40] leave here and die in a car wreck we
[1:50:41] don't know
[1:50:44] but we know that our redeemer liveth
[1:50:47] and in the middle of the book while
[1:50:49] you're going through the trial
[1:50:51] when you still don't feel right when you
[1:50:54] still feel like
[1:50:56] like life is against you when you still
[1:50:58] feel like everything's going the wrong
[1:51:00] way
[1:51:00] that's the moment when you've got to get
[1:51:02] a vision of the word and say i know
[1:51:05] it's one thing for the preacher to know
[1:51:06] it's one thing for the for the song
[1:51:08] leader to know it's one thing for the
[1:51:09] deacons to know but
[1:51:10] i know i know my redeemer liveth
[1:51:14] and if i have to stay streaming at home
[1:51:17] and sick in my body but i know my
[1:51:18] redeemer liveth if i'm in a hospital i
[1:51:20] still know my redeemer liveth if i'm at
[1:51:22] home with my family i still know
[1:51:24] that my redeemer liveth i know it's a
[1:51:27] personal revelation to me something that
[1:51:29] i
[1:51:29] know myself no one can take that from me
[1:51:36] jesus disciples got out on a boat
[1:51:41] left jesus standing on the shore you
[1:51:43] know the story
[1:51:46] it went off without him get out in the
[1:51:48] middle
[1:51:49] of the sea and john says it this way he
[1:51:52] says it got dark
[1:51:55] all our troubles seemed to come in the
[1:51:56] dark when we can't see our way out
[1:52:00] it got dark and then the wind grew
[1:52:02] contrary
[1:52:04] and the wind started blowing and tossing
[1:52:06] the ship about
[1:52:08] it left him on the shore they said oh we
[1:52:11] wish we could see him
[1:52:14] we wish we could see we wish we would we
[1:52:16] could know who he is
[1:52:18] we wish he was here with us
[1:52:21] there'd be a toss by the sea all of a
[1:52:23] sudden they see something walking on the
[1:52:25] water
[1:52:26] and what kind of water was he walking on
[1:52:28] church
[1:52:30] he wasn't walking on calm water go and
[1:52:32] read it
[1:52:34] he was walking on stormy waves
[1:52:40] maybe they'd see him and he was out
[1:52:41] there and as he walked they caught a
[1:52:43] glimpse of him and then he disappeared
[1:52:45] they kind of what what is it is it a
[1:52:47] ghost what is it
[1:52:49] no it's jesus walking in the middle of
[1:52:53] the storm
[1:52:55] not waiting for the storm to end but
[1:52:57] right there in the middle of it
[1:53:01] they saw a vision of their redeemer amen
[1:53:05] what did he say brother said what
[1:53:07] happened just in the hour of their fear
[1:53:10] just when they were scared they were
[1:53:11] going to die that's what he did for job
[1:53:12] just in the hour
[1:53:14] when he was most afraid by the same that
[1:53:15] he was going to die
[1:53:17] what happened just to the hour of their
[1:53:19] fear a voice came and said fear not
[1:53:22] it's me amen
[1:53:26] it's not what he does for us so many
[1:53:28] times i can't explain to you what your
[1:53:30] trial is or why you had to go through it
[1:53:32] or what's going on in your life but i
[1:53:33] can tell you this if you can catch a
[1:53:35] vision of the word
[1:53:37] walking in the middle of the storm amen
[1:53:39] you can catch a vision that is still
[1:53:40] there
[1:53:41] you can catch if you can catch a glimpse
[1:53:43] of him he can begin to speak to you and
[1:53:44] say fear not
[1:53:45] it is i hey man let's bow our heads
[1:53:49] together
[1:53:52] maybe you're in the middle of the worst
[1:53:53] year of your life today
[1:53:55] if you just play something softly
[1:54:00] maybe it's the worst year of your life
[1:54:02] [Music]
[1:54:03] maybe the worst day of the worst week of
[1:54:05] the worst year
[1:54:07] the worst decade of a lifetime
[1:54:08] [Music]
[1:54:12] you don't know why that happened and i
[1:54:15] don't know why that happened
[1:54:17] it's i don't want to stand up here as a
[1:54:19] minister and complain this has been a
[1:54:21] a strange year for preachers
[1:54:22] [Music]
[1:54:24] we've seen everything that's went on and
[1:54:28] struggled to struggle to even get half
[1:54:29] your congregation in the church at one
[1:54:31] time and that's not the people's fault
[1:54:33] it's just the way it happened this year
[1:54:36] it's hard
[1:54:41] you want to help people you want to pray
[1:54:42] for people and i get so frustrated
[1:54:44] because you're not even able to go and
[1:54:46] pray
[1:54:47] but we serve a god he said speak the
[1:54:50] word
[1:54:51] he said to him that the centurion said
[1:54:53] to speak the word only
[1:54:55] my daughter will be healed my servant
[1:54:58] will be healed
[1:55:01] it's been a rough year we're at the end
[1:55:04] of it but i don't know what next year
[1:55:05] holds
[1:55:08] but i know this if you'll look
[1:55:11] [Music]
[1:55:12] every time
[1:55:16] not part of the time because he's the
[1:55:19] god who never fails
[1:55:22] every time if you look at the word
[1:55:25] instead of your circumstances
[1:55:26] if you look at the word instead of your
[1:55:28] waves
[1:55:30] every time don't look at what the people
[1:55:33] say about you
[1:55:34] don't look at what the world says but
[1:55:37] every time
[1:55:38] if you could catch a glimpse of him
[1:55:40] through the waves
[1:55:41] through the coronavirus through the bad
[1:55:43] news through the heartache through the
[1:55:44] sickness
[1:55:45] if you can catch a glimpse of the word
[1:55:48] walking on the water
[1:55:51] you can say i know my redeemer lives
[1:55:56] i'm tying myself to it
[1:55:59] that's my absolute that's what's going
[1:56:02] to get me through
[1:56:03] would you just do that this morning just
[1:56:06] take a moment catch a glimpse of it
[1:56:08] you may be worried about what life holds
[1:56:10] in the future you may not know
[1:56:12] what next year will be like you may not
[1:56:13] know what the next hour will be like but
[1:56:15] i know this
[1:56:17] that if he takes everything away from me
[1:56:19] there's something inside of my heart
[1:56:21] that cries out the lord gives
[1:56:23] and the lord takes away blessed be the
[1:56:26] name of the lord
[1:56:28] though he saves me yet i'll trust him
[1:56:31] i will not refuse to speak his name
[1:56:35] but i'll fall down on my face though i'm
[1:56:37] in mourning though i have rags
[1:56:39] though i have ashes all fall on my face
[1:56:41] and i worship him
[1:56:43] because he's worthy of my praise
[1:56:47] could you look at him as your redeemer
[1:56:48] today it's your pericle it is your
[1:56:52] substitutionary offering job can look at
[1:56:54] that sacrifice said i know i made a
[1:56:56] sacrifice
[1:56:57] for my children i know for myself i know
