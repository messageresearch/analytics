But there's an experience. And when when God comes on the scene, the presence of God when you first felt him, that's what changes a person's life. Thank you. &gt;&gt; That's what begins to soften a person's heart to where you can receive what God's trying to do in your life. &gt;&gt; And what do you have to do to that? You have to surrender to that. &gt;&gt; It's a work of the Holy Ghost. It's the grace of God that comes upon a person's life, not just to make them a religious person, but to change their life. &gt;&gt; Amen.
