What a testimony that was. &gt;&gt; You know, uh, Sunday Eden, a lot of time you're struggling to to stay awake, but you know that I didn't see anybody struggling at all. What a powerful testimony that was. You know, we all we all have a little bit different background. We all came from, you know, different places. We all have a different testimony. But the main thing is is being changed from what you were to what God can make you. And and that's the thing, you got a testimony. You've got to have a testimony. But there's an experience. And when when God comes on the scene, the presence of God when you first felt him, that's what changes a person's life. Thank you. &gt;&gt; That's what begins to soften a person's heart to where you can receive what God's trying to do in your life. &gt;&gt; And what do you have to do to that? You have to surrender to that. &gt;&gt; It's a work of the Holy Ghost. It's the grace of God that comes upon a person's life, not just to make them a religious person, but to change their life. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I we just so appreciate the presence of the Lord here tonight. I appreciate what our brother had to say. You know, if tonight if you you you have that on your heart to surrender to him, now's the time. &gt;&gt; The presence of the Lord is here. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a predestinated moment. It was a predestinated moment for this brother to meet the people that he did. He hadn't heard the things that most of you young people have heard your entire lives. &gt;&gt; But there was a predestinated moment. And when that happens, that's God. &gt;&gt; Amen.
