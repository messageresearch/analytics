[43:05] and I appreciate that the person that
[43:08] got those to me and uh there's there's
[43:10] several of those if you need one for
[43:12] yourself or for a family member we
[43:14] believe that God uses that as he did
[43:16] with Paul there's nothing special about
[43:18] any man but I do think that that it is a
[43:21] special thing brother Brandon prayed
[43:23] over those or at least had those in his
[43:25] possession and uh but we're gonna we're
[43:28] gonna believe that God will will heal
[43:30] the sick and whatever we have need of
[43:33] he'll meet that need second chronicles
[43:34] 20 17 you shall not need to fight in
[43:38] this battle
[43:40] set yourselves stand you still
[43:44] and see the salvation of the Lord with
[43:47] you oh Judah and Jerusalem fear not nor
[43:51] be dismayed tomorrow go out against them
[43:55] for the Lord will be with you amen God
[43:58] bless you you can be seated
[44:00] speak to you about preparation for
[44:02] victory
[44:03] and you go to fight a war how you
[44:06] prepare for that war shows what you
[44:10] believe will happen if you prepare in a
[44:13] kind of a way it says well we know that
[44:15] the enemy is greater than we are we know
[44:18] that we won't be able to really do
[44:19] anything we're just going to put up a
[44:21] fight and we're all going to die uh and
[44:24] then and then it'll all be over you
[44:26] don't put as much preparation into it
[44:28] but when you know that Victory Is
[44:30] Possible then you begin to prepare for
[44:33] victory not for defeat but I want to
[44:35] tell you tonight that Victory is not
[44:37] just possible but Victory is actually
[44:40] promised to us by by God we know that
[44:43] when we leave this age you can believe
[44:45] what you want to but I don't believe
[44:47] we're going to leave here A bunch of
[44:48] people that are half dragging our way
[44:51] into heaven and just barely made it in
[44:53] on the skin of our teeth and we're just
[44:55] barely able to make it and we're
[44:57] weakened down and we're gonna look at
[44:58] all these other agents and say boy you
[45:00] guys had it but us we just barely made
[45:02] it I don't believe it's going to be that
[45:04] way at all I believe there's going to be
[45:05] a group of people here at the end time
[45:07] that's going to go in in a full force
[45:09] that we're going to be the people of God
[45:11] we're going to be the the soldiers that
[45:13] that are fully equipped and and fully
[45:16] able and I think the other ages are
[45:18] going to come up to the Overcomers of
[45:20] laodicea they're going to come up to us
[45:22] and say how did you make it you face the
[45:24] hardest battle but you had the greatest
[45:26] victory
[45:27] yeah and so when we prepare for this age
[45:30] we're not preparing for defeat we're not
[45:32] preparing for Doom and Gloom and we're
[45:34] not preparing for uh for for things to
[45:36] just go wrong we're preparing for God to
[45:39] move
[45:40] we're preparing for the sick to be
[45:42] healed we're preparing for for God to
[45:44] move on for our children we're preparing
[45:46] for backsliders to come back home
[45:49] I get tired of people preparing for the
[45:51] end times preparing for for a squeeze
[45:53] preparing for something else you can
[45:55] prepare for the tribulation if you want
[45:57] to but I'm not preparing for tribulation
[45:59] I'm preparing for a rapture
[46:02] I'm getting ready to go home this is not
[46:05] the end this is not the last time or
[46:07] we're going home it's the last time for
[46:10] the world it's the end time for the
[46:12] world it's the end of struggling nature
[46:14] brother says that 7c was the end for
[46:16] everything else but for the bride it's
[46:19] not the end for the Eternal amen
[46:22] it's the beginning
[46:24] Hallelujah
[46:26] hey man when God prepares to do
[46:28] something he prepares for victory
[46:31] and we must prepare for victory
[46:34] and even if everything else is defeat
[46:36] say anything of Noah when no one
[46:39] prepared the ark he wasn't preparing for
[46:41] what the world was preparing for
[46:44] you'd have heard the rain was coming you
[46:46] might have built a great big shelter or
[46:48] some great great kind of thing but
[46:50] that's not what Noah did Noah prepared
[46:52] for victory
[46:53] he didn't prepare to be drowned
[46:56] he didn't prepare for his children to be
[46:58] overcome
[47:00] listen we live in an age when the
[47:01] children are being overcome by
[47:03] perversion when the people are being
[47:05] overcome by Church entity going to be
[47:08] overcome by cold formalism but we are
[47:10] not preparing for our children to be
[47:12] overcome by this world we are preparing
[47:15] for victory for our children to have a
[47:17] victory
[47:21] we're preparing we're building an ark
[47:25] amen God was going to prepare to destroy
[47:28] the enemies of the world and Noah had to
[47:30] build a way to prepare something to ride
[47:32] through it yeah
[47:33] amen and brother random in that message
[47:35] preparation or God has provided away he
[47:39] said what are we trying to do with this
[47:40] word this morning he said it's build
[47:43] something for you to ride through on
[47:45] your victory
[47:47] we're building something for you to have
[47:49] Victory they didn't build the ark so
[47:51] they would all die they built the ark so
[47:52] they would live
[47:54] this message was not built so that we
[47:56] would die this message was here was sent
[47:59] to us so we would live
[48:01] [Applause]
[48:03] are you with me so far
[48:06] Moses
[48:07] prepared for victory he said or Noah
[48:10] rather prepared for victory God's word
[48:11] thus saith the Lord see right through on
[48:14] his word God said so
[48:17] Moses prepared for victory by coming in
[48:19] the presence of the burning bush we
[48:21] talked about that Wednesday night and
[48:22] again this morning a little bit how he
[48:24] come in the presence of the logos
[48:26] how he come in the presence of uh the
[48:29] warmth of the of the power of God God
[48:32] made his presence known to Moses
[48:34] brother Benson and stranger God Appears
[48:36] in fire he said they say this is
[48:38] Wildfire well I admit we got some
[48:40] wildfire
[48:42] I'll admit that today
[48:44] but I'd rather have a little Wildfire
[48:46] than no fire at all
[48:48] wouldn't you he said the trouble of it
[48:51] is with you teachers
[48:53] come on you're trying to sit back and
[48:55] say oh I'm good I enjoy a good teacher
[48:57] with the best of them but I want
[48:58] teaching that teaches me about
[48:59] possibilities not teaching is teaching
[49:02] me for failure
[49:03] I don't want a denominational Doctrine I
[49:06] don't want a doctor that doesn't know by
[49:07] the day whether I'm coming in or going
[49:09] out or what is truth and what's not
[49:11] truth we want teaching that teaches us
[49:13] about the word of God which shows us
[49:15] what our end is what our Victory is
[49:18] not teaching that prepares us for some
[49:21] oh every the message is being deceived
[49:23] and everybody's falling apart I I would
[49:25] like to contradict that today can we
[49:27] just contradict that and be like Joshua
[49:29] and Caleb and say we're more than able
[49:31] to take the land
[49:32] [Applause]
[49:35] let's prepare for victory
[49:37] amen
[49:39] the medicine you teachers you're trying
[49:40] to sit back and say back there on the
[49:41] day of Pentecost it's happening back
[49:43] there they had this he said you're
[49:44] trying to let the people that's cold get
[49:46] worn by painted flowers you can't warm
[49:49] by a picture yeah
[49:51] well you can't get well you can't Warren
[49:54] by a picture what's that what the heck's
[49:55] fun but what you got now that's it yeah
[49:58] you can't warn by painted fire talking
[50:00] to theology what they did back there
[50:02] what he was there he is now just the
[50:04] same
[50:07] Samson prepared for victory
[50:10] I buy a shamgar rather prepared for
[50:13] victory by encouraging his family yeah
[50:15] yeah do you know that brother Brandon
[50:17] said that the year before
[50:19] he put all the all the corn up and all
[50:21] the grain every year they come back down
[50:24] and stole it
[50:25] but it's silly prepared
[50:27] for the eventuality one day he was going
[50:31] to be an overcomer
[50:33] and so he put the he put it up some of
[50:35] you that are sick and you've been sick
[50:37] for a long time but every time you come
[50:38] to the house of the Lord every time you
[50:40] get down on your knees to pray you ought
[50:42] to prepare for victory you ought to put
[50:44] up put in more word more word more word
[50:46] more faith why because you're preparing
[50:49] not for defeat so I Was Defeated last
[50:51] year but this might be your year
[50:55] and shamgar stood there and brother
[50:58] remember this little Sandbar he he got
[51:00] his place filled up got his food all

[51:49] their purpose is shoot fluid in a dead
[51:51] man to make sure he stays there but

[55:56] first Samuel 17 45 David said to the
[55:58] Philistine thou cometh to me with a
[56:00] sword with a spear with a shield but I
[56:02] come to thee in the name of the Lord of
[56:04] hosts the god of the armies of Israel
[56:05] whom that has to fight and you knew
[56:07] whose name he came in because it worked
[56:12] you know if you got the right name
[56:13] because if you got the right name it
[56:15] works
[56:16] there's power in the name of Jesus if
[56:18] you got the name it works
[56:20] [Music]
[56:22] Here Come Little David brother said just
[56:24] the bouncing in the spirit
[56:28] you know I told you this morning I've
[56:29] read you I've read you everything
[56:30] brother Branham said as far as I know
[56:32] both sides however the brown talked
[56:34] about Still Waters Run Deep and all of
[56:36] these things but there's a time that you
[56:37] need that Stillness there's a time you
[56:39] need that death there's a time you need
[56:41] to be bouncing in the spirit
[56:43] everything has a place we realize that
[56:46] there's a time for all of those things
[56:48] but there's a time you need to get
[56:49] excited sometimes
[56:51] you need to get in the spirit of God
[56:52] just get to bouncing in the spirit
[56:54] Hahaha he said oh what a Holy Roller
[56:57] Victory already
[57:00] all right David had Victory before he
[57:03] ever cut the Giant's head off before he
[57:04] ever threw a stone before he ever picked
[57:06] up a stone he already had the victory
[57:09] and Saul in his army were already
[57:11] defeated before they ever faced the
[57:13] Giant
[57:14] because they couldn't believe that they
[57:16] could ever face that giant and win so
[57:19] they cowered in their tits when they
[57:20] should have went out and faced it but
[57:21] instead of doing that they were shaking
[57:23] in their boots but David was dancing why
[57:25] he was bouncing in the spirit because he
[57:28] had already got the victory he had
[57:30] prepared for it he'd come in the name of
[57:31] the Lord
[57:33] Oh my he said why he placed the name of
[57:36] the Lord God of Israel before him all
[57:38] devils in Hell couldn't wait across that
[57:41] Little David just a dancing in the
[57:43] spirit
[57:44] Oh Glory Hallelujah and brother Brown
[57:46] talks about David being a dancer he said
[57:48] David was a dancer yes he said he was
[57:50] dancing one day and and here come uh
[57:52] here his wife looked out the window and
[57:54] saw him she was embarrassed by him he
[57:56] said if you don't like that watch this
[57:59] he danced with some more
[58:02] huh
[58:03] it's a dancer again there there's a
[58:05] place
[58:06] you don't dance just to dance
[58:09] I'm asking somebody told you to dance
[58:11] but if you ever got your your your feet
[58:14] baptized with fire
[58:18] Hallelujah you close brother talks about
[58:21] that Turtle it couldn't find a way to
[58:22] make him move all right yeah but there's
[58:24] one way to make a turtle move put fire
[58:27] under it yeah build a fire on him some
[58:29] of some of us Turtles would move and so
[58:31] if we had a fire under us
[58:33] I'll include myself in there for the
[58:36] herald some of us Turtles would move
[58:37] with a fire built thunderous I'll tell
[58:39] you that's what we need it's a fire of
[58:40] the Holy Ghost
[58:43] I'll tell you what if you're a dancer
[58:45] some people aren't dancers some people
[58:47] probably shouldn't dance
[58:49] but if you're
[58:52] if you're a person that dances when you
[58:54] get the victory if you get the close
[58:56] enough to the fire you'll dance
[58:58] if you're a person that shouts when you
[59:00] get to Victory you when you get close
[59:02] enough to the fire you'll Shout
[59:05] are you with me now
[59:07] amen my goodness
[59:09] David was a dancer he said here he went
[59:12] up there just to dancing in the spirit
[59:13] as hard as she could Why by faith he saw
[59:17] the victory
[59:20] glory to God he saw the victory he took
[59:23] his little old sling in there one of
[59:25] these stones and he even dance and here
[59:27] it comes
[59:28] coming around all
[59:30] right oh he said what was it he had five
[59:32] they were both laughing at the other one
[59:36] Goliath was laughing at David because he
[59:38] was an insignificant little little young
[59:40] man didn't mean nothing to the world he
[59:42] was laughing at David but David was
[59:44] laughing at Goliath because he knew he'd
[59:46] come in the name of the Lord
[59:48] he knew he had the victory
[59:51] and what was he said he had five stones
[59:54] f-i-a-f-a-i-t-h and five fingers wrapped
[59:56] this string around j-e-s-u-s he said

[1:00:03] when he set that loose the Holy Ghost
[1:00:05] got a hold of that little Old Stone and
[1:00:07] picked up a speed about a thousand miles
[1:00:09] per second struck that giant between the
[1:00:11] face and he fell forward yeah he said
[1:00:13] there goes David Marching In pulling old
[1:00:15] Goliath's head behind in Victory
[1:00:18] God prepared him a man to take care of
[1:00:20] it why can't he go why can't he haul the
[1:00:23] head of Goliath behind him because he
[1:00:24] went up dancing believe him
[1:00:29] Hallelujah
[1:00:31] the upper room just one more
[1:00:34] example here
[1:00:35] and we'll move on
[1:00:37] in the upper room brother man said
[1:00:39] brother about several hundred years
[1:00:41] after that
[1:00:42] the Church of God will become tied down
[1:00:44] yeah
[1:00:45] get tied down sometimes
[1:00:47] but I can hear one thing saying behold I
[1:00:50] send a promise for the father upon you
[1:00:52] I want this gospel preached in all the
[1:00:54] world I want science to follow the
[1:00:56] Believers I want to heal the sick till I
[1:00:58] come again I'm going away but I give you
[1:01:00] the keys to the kingdom whatever you ask
[1:01:02] him my name that I'll do but before you
[1:01:04] do this I got to prepare you
[1:01:06] he said they climbed up the hillside
[1:01:07] something to the temple stayed in the
[1:01:09] upper room until all of a sudden they
[1:01:11] got to a place one said I don't care if
[1:01:13] I'm a Methodist
[1:01:14] oh my
[1:01:16] God another one said I don't care if I'm
[1:01:17] a Baptist
[1:01:21] God don't you see what we've gotten to
[1:01:23] do if we're not careful we've gotten
[1:01:25] carnal yeah
[1:01:26] yeah I'm a Word of Life Tabernacle
[1:01:28] almost so and so whatever it is but
[1:01:30] we've gotten carnal said are you not yet
[1:01:32] carnal he said when they got up in the
[1:01:33] upper room they all come in one Accord
[1:01:35] in one place and they say I don't care
[1:01:37] if I'm a Baptist or a sad you see all he
[1:01:39] said until all the differences got out
[1:01:41] of them amen and when they did they
[1:01:43] started blessing God and about that time
[1:01:45] the preparation Come From Heaven
[1:01:48] oh this is the preparation that we need
[1:01:50] cloven tongues like fire and they come
[1:01:52] out and they begin to stagger like drunk
[1:01:54] men but the man said they Spilled Out
[1:01:55] the windows they spilled down into the
[1:01:57] street staggering like drunk men
[1:02:00] he said that was God's preparation God
[1:02:02] hasn't changed his plan that was to be
[1:02:04] until Jesus come back again it sounds
[1:02:07] ridiculous to an ordinary man why the
[1:02:09] very idea you mean I have to go down and
[1:02:10] act like a maniac he said you'll either
[1:02:12] do that or stay out either one you want
[1:02:14] to yeah
[1:02:15] I'd rather prepare for victory
[1:02:21] Jehoshaphat made preparations
[1:02:24] for a battle
[1:02:26] that he knew he couldn't win by himself
[1:02:30] let's just be honest with each other
[1:02:33] we're living in a time when you can't
[1:02:35] win against Leo to see it by yourself
[1:02:38] you can't win against the enemy let's
[1:02:41] come up ahead in front of you by
[1:02:42] yourself you can't win against that
[1:02:44] cancer by yourself you can't win against
[1:02:46] that Stroke by yourself you can't win
[1:02:48] against that heart disease by yourself
[1:02:49] you can't win against old age by
[1:02:51] yourself slow down
[1:02:53] preach amen that's the age we're living
[1:02:56] in you can't win by yourself and
[1:02:59] Jehoshaphat knew all these other tribes
[1:03:01] and kingdoms had come up against him and
[1:03:03] he knew militarily there was no way
[1:03:06] there was no Hope of Victory
[1:03:09] and so what did he do he started praying
[1:03:11] and fasting yeah
[1:03:12] yeah now that'd do us some good
[1:03:15] it'd be all right to pray and fast a
[1:03:17] little bit and see if God would move
[1:03:19] because we know we can't have a
[1:03:22] successful service without the spirit of
[1:03:24] God
[1:03:26] it is not because we're talented that we
[1:03:28] can feel the presence of God if you were
[1:03:31] here Wednesday night we felt the
[1:03:32] presence of the Lord so rich in the
[1:03:34] building you can't make that happen you
[1:03:36] don't do that by Talent you don't come
[1:03:38] before even our regular Services you
[1:03:40] don't make that happen or our meetings
[1:03:42] you don't make that happen by Talent
[1:03:44] it's God chooses to come Among Us
[1:03:47] we can't win on our own all we can do is
[1:03:50] ask God lord would you help me would you
[1:03:54] help me I can't do it but I'm coming in
[1:03:56] your name and I'm going to believe you
[1:03:58] I'm gonna believe your word
[1:04:00] hey you've heard you've probably heard
[1:04:02] me preach on this before but I just want
[1:04:04] to encourage you with this before we
[1:04:05] before we go now Joshua fat began to
[1:04:09] pray in the fast and spirit of God began
[1:04:11] to move in the congregation
[1:04:13] yeah I like that
[1:04:15] in verse 14 it tells us that that a
[1:04:17] levite of the sons of asaph begin to
[1:04:20] prophesy the spirit of the Lord and
[1:04:22] Mystic congregation I don't know this
[1:04:24] but he is a singer because he's sons of
[1:04:27] asaph and we know he's a singer
[1:04:29] right so I don't know how he prophesied
[1:04:31] but I think maybe he prophesied in song
[1:04:35] because he actually that would be his
[1:04:38] job that would be his office the spirit
[1:04:40] of the Lord might not come like he would
[1:04:41] have Prophet or something else but it
[1:04:42] was on him as it was a it was a prophecy
[1:04:46] in song you believe you can prophesy
[1:04:48] when you sing
[1:04:50] yeah every time you think I'm going to
[1:04:53] make it he already said that I could
[1:04:55] what do you do and you're prophesying
[1:04:58] you're prophesying in music
[1:05:01] so now Jehoshaphat that's why it's so
[1:05:03] bad when you go out in the world you
[1:05:05] begin to get these worldly music look at
[1:05:07] the confession of it and some Christian
[1:05:09] music by the way is that way as well
[1:05:11] so-called Christian the confession is
[1:05:13] Doom and Gloom the confession as well
[1:05:15] all my all my problems all my might as
[1:05:18] well get and get my beer and begin to
[1:05:19] drink it that's not what the confession
[1:05:20] of a Christian ought to be
[1:05:23] I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry
[1:05:26] well you got a friend who sits closer
[1:05:28] than a brother
[1:05:29] [Applause]
[1:05:32] you got somebody that'll stick with you
[1:05:34] aren't you glad for that today
[1:05:37] make preparations for victory not for
[1:05:39] defeat
[1:05:41] so he's saying he he gave them a
[1:05:44] prophecy prophesied perhaps through his
[1:05:46] music
[1:05:47] and he said hearken y'all Judah you
[1:05:49] inhabitants of Jerusalem Thou King
[1:05:51] Jehoshaphat does saith the Lord unto you
[1:05:53] be Not Afraid nor dismayed by reason of
[1:05:55] this great multitude for the battle is
[1:05:57] not yours but God's
[1:06:00] tomorrow go you down against him behold
[1:06:02] they come up by the Cliff of this you
[1:06:05] shall find them at the end of the brook
[1:06:06] before the Wilderness of Jerusalem you
[1:06:09] shall not need to fight in this battle
[1:06:12] set yourselves
[1:06:13] I love this stand you still
[1:06:17] now they've still had to prepare
[1:06:19] they still had to go up
[1:06:21] they still carried weapons
[1:06:23] but he said when you get there
[1:06:27] Hallelujah you're not gonna have to
[1:06:29] fight
[1:06:30] the fighting's gonna be done for you
[1:06:33] amen he said set yourself stand still
[1:06:36] and see the salvation of the Lord with
[1:06:38] you oh Judah and Jerusalem you can
[1:06:40] preach gloom and doom if you want to but
[1:06:42] I want to preach something that'll cause
[1:06:44] the people to set themselves yeah stand
[1:06:46] still and see the salvation of the Lord
[1:06:49] fear not or be displayed tomorrow go out
[1:06:51] against him for the Lord will be with
[1:06:52] you Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his
[1:06:54] face to the ground and all Judah and the
[1:06:56] inhabitants of Jerusalem fell before the
[1:06:58] Lord worshiping the Lord and the Levites
[1:07:01] of the children of the cohathites of the
[1:07:02] children of the Court had stood up to
[1:07:04] praise the Lord God of Israel with a
[1:07:07] a loud voice
[1:07:10] huh
[1:07:11] a loud voice on high so they got up on a
[1:07:14] platform
[1:07:15] [Laughter]
[1:07:20] and people had to start putting their
[1:07:21] earplugs in
[1:07:23] oh we don't allow such as that sometimes
[1:07:26] when you need a victory
[1:07:28] you might want to allow it
[1:07:30] you hadn't had a victory in 70 years
[1:07:32] maybe you need to let somebody get up on
[1:07:35] the platform sing with a loud voice
[1:07:38] [Applause]
[1:07:41] they stood up to praise the Lord God of
[1:07:43] Israel with a loud voice on high and
[1:07:46] they Rose early in the morning
[1:07:48] oh my after being encouraged by the
[1:07:50] singing They Rose early in the morning
[1:07:52] went forth Into the Wilderness of Toccoa
[1:07:54] and as they went forth Jehoshaphat stood
[1:07:56] and said now here he's going to preach
[1:07:58] to him he's going to tell them what the
[1:07:59] word says hear him heal Judah the
[1:08:01] inhabitants of Jerusalem believe in the
[1:08:03] Lord your God so shall you be
[1:08:05] established believe his Prophet so shall
[1:08:07] you prosper believe what the spirit
[1:08:09] spoke to you believe what came what the
[1:08:11] word the book that was open in your
[1:08:13] hours
[1:08:15] when you consulted with the people he
[1:08:17] appointed singers unto the Lord
[1:08:19] watch
[1:08:20] that they should praise the beauty of
[1:08:23] holiness
[1:08:24] as they went out before the army
[1:08:27] this is a strange Army
[1:08:29] they weren't just a marching band out
[1:08:30] there just got to keep the people in
[1:08:32] line and Rhythm but this was a a bunch
[1:08:34] of singers
[1:08:35] going out saying praise the Lord the
[1:08:38] Lord is beautiful the Lord is Beauty and
[1:08:41] his Holiness he's beautiful in his
[1:08:43] simple he's Mighty in his accent they're
[1:08:45] going I'm praising God
[1:08:48] walking before the Army can you imagine
[1:08:49] how that encouraged the army
[1:08:53] hear the musicians of them singers as
[1:08:56] they got up there they'd prayed up they
[1:08:58] got ready before the man you just come
[1:09:00] dragging in but but he's had him get up
[1:09:02] early in the morning and he had him go
[1:09:03] in front of the people and he said now
[1:09:05] you go and you you seen something
[1:09:07] that'll help him
[1:09:08] he went out before the Army and say
[1:09:11] praise the Lord for his mercy endureth
[1:09:13] forever and when they begin to sing
[1:09:17] now watch somebody's got to sing
[1:09:19] somebody's got to praise
[1:09:21] we can all praise can't we we may not
[1:09:24] all be able to sing although when we
[1:09:25] sing a congregational song We ought to
[1:09:27] all sing
[1:09:28] but we may not all be able to sing but
[1:09:30] we can all praise
[1:09:31] and the Bible says when they began to
[1:09:34] sing and to praise the Lord set
[1:09:36] ambushments against the children of
[1:09:39] Ammon Moab and mount fear which will
[1:09:41] come against Judah and they were smitten
[1:09:43] yes for the children of Ammon and Moab
[1:09:46] stood up against the inhabitants of
[1:09:48] Mount fear utterly to say and Destroy
[1:09:50] them in other words they started
[1:09:51] fighting amongst themselves
[1:09:53] let the enemy do that
[1:09:56] come on could we just do that let the
[1:10:00] Enemy Fight among himself
[1:10:03] we don't want to do that
[1:10:05] that's not what the people of God do you
[1:10:08] don't ever find the people of God begin
[1:10:10] to fight among themselves defeating
[1:10:11] themselves not when they were led by God
[1:10:15] not when they were following the word
[1:10:16] but it was always the enemy
[1:10:20] a camp in confusion turns on its own
[1:10:25] as the famous the Roman general famously
[1:10:27] went into the camp for the of Carthage
[1:10:29] and the first Carthage I think did it to
[1:10:32] them and then they turned around did it
[1:10:33] to Carthage they went into the camp at
[1:10:35] night and they set fires everywhere yeah
[1:10:38] and when they set a fire everybody wakes
[1:10:40] up oh no a fire I'm gonna fight who said
[1:10:42] it and kill them there's stumbling
[1:10:44] around the dark and they go out and kill
[1:10:45] somebody and kill him they're killing
[1:10:47] their own men yeah why because a camp in
[1:10:49] confusion fights among themselves
[1:10:53] but the Romans knew if they could get
[1:10:56] the camp and disarray the next day the
[1:10:58] battle would be easy
[1:11:00] oh God help us if you just recognize
[1:11:03] today that's what the enemy is trying to
[1:11:04] do why don't we turn that around on him
[1:11:06] when we come together in unity and we
[1:11:08] begin to sing and to praise I don't care
[1:11:10] what somebody says about me I don't care
[1:11:12] if I get to be the main one in the
[1:11:14] kitchen or not I don't care if I get to
[1:11:15] be the main one in the church or not I
[1:11:17] don't care if I can get to sing a
[1:11:19] special I don't care if anybody knows my
[1:11:21] name I'm gonna come put my shoulder to
[1:11:23] the wheel I'm gonna be one who sits in
[1:11:25] the house of God and worships God and
[1:11:27] Praises God and when I I'm not gonna
[1:11:29] fight among the people I'm gonna fight
[1:11:31] the enemy
[1:11:32] [Applause]
[1:11:34] when they begin to praise God
[1:11:40] the enemy became in confusion
[1:11:42] everyone helping to destroy another
[1:11:46] Spirit of Satan yeah
[1:11:48] People Help destroy somebody
[1:11:51] see somebody wounded laying on the
[1:11:53] ground yeah walk by and put a spear in
[1:11:55] them yeah Spirit of Satan yeah
[1:11:57] remember the man that come to David
[1:12:00] and Saul had been laying there on his
[1:12:02] sword he tried to commit suicide he
[1:12:04] wasn't able to and the man run to David
[1:12:06] thinking David would reward him
[1:12:08] because he killed Saul
[1:12:10] Saul even asked him to
[1:12:12] anyone thinking to get a reward and
[1:12:14] David killed him
[1:12:16] said don't touch God's anointed yeah you
[1:12:18] don't kill the man of slaying on the
[1:12:20] ground shoot him full of poison yeah
[1:12:22] words of poison I need to watch what we
[1:12:25] say
[1:12:27] are you hearing me tonight
[1:12:29] oh look we don't need to we don't need
[1:12:31] to do that let God take care of it let
[1:12:33] God fight our battles
[1:12:37] they helped to destroy one another when
[1:12:38] Judah come towards the Watchtower in the
[1:12:40] wilderness they looked to the multitude
[1:12:42] behold there were dead bodies Fallen to
[1:12:45] the Earth
[1:12:46] and then escaped
[1:12:48] walked out there expecting this great
[1:12:50] battle but God said I'm going to fight
[1:12:52] for you but here they come out and they
[1:12:55] begin to walk out and begin to look well
[1:12:56] there's
[1:12:57] there's that cancer
[1:12:59] it's dead yeah
[1:13:02] yeah look at this right there's that
[1:13:04] that
[1:13:06] unforgiveness
[1:13:09] the thing I held my heart for so long
[1:13:10] but when I began to praise
[1:13:13] when I began to partake in the meeting
[1:13:15] it began to leave me yeah yeah there's
[1:13:18] that squabble between the husband and a
[1:13:19] wife instead
[1:13:22] there's that that church problem there
[1:13:24] there's that there's that sickness all
[1:13:26] those things whatever it is that's going
[1:13:28] on in your life they begin to walk
[1:13:29] around and they begin to look they're
[1:13:31] dead
[1:13:33] they can't hurt me no more
[1:13:35] what did Miriam do when she realized
[1:13:37] that her taskmasters had been destroyed
[1:13:39] she began to sing and begin to dance
[1:13:41] because there had been a victory
[1:13:44] Victory had been prepared for them
[1:13:47] he said and when Jehoshaphat and his
[1:13:49] people came to take away the spoil of
[1:13:51] them they found among them in abundance
[1:13:53] both riches with the dead bodies
[1:13:56] now think about this for a moment
[1:13:59] if you've ever killed a spirit in your
[1:14:02] life how many have ever had God just
[1:14:03] come in and take something away from
[1:14:05] them
[1:14:06] I probably all have at some point now
[1:14:10] what what happens is when you lose that
[1:14:13] you also gain something
[1:14:16] because what was happening is that
[1:14:18] Spirit was clogging you up
[1:14:20] you were unable because that Spirit was
[1:14:22] hogging all the all the gold and all the
[1:14:25] silver that Spirit was hugging all the
[1:14:27] precious jewels that Spirit was hugging
[1:14:28] your joy it was taken away every time
[1:14:30] you saw that brother you just oh you
[1:14:32] just couldn't stand it but when God took
[1:14:33] that away from you when you let it go
[1:14:35] and and you begin to praise God and that
[1:14:37] thing began to leave all of a sudden you
[1:14:39] begin to realize there's joy there's
[1:14:41] peace there's long suffering there's a
[1:14:43] fruits of spirit why there were great
[1:14:44] riches among the dead bodies
[1:14:47] precious jewels which they stripped out
[1:14:50] for themselves and more than they could
[1:14:52] carry and they were three days in
[1:14:55] gathering of the spoil it was so much
[1:14:58] and on the fourth day
[1:15:00] they assembled themselves
[1:15:02] they had a meeting
[1:15:07] you know when we should kill the those
[1:15:08] things tonight
[1:15:11] [Music]
[1:15:12] don't spend one more night with the
[1:15:14] frogs
[1:15:16] that's what Pharaoh decided he'd do he
[1:15:18] put it off for another day just had that
[1:15:20] many more problems to deal with why
[1:15:22] spend one more night with a bunch of
[1:15:23] dead stinking frogs
[1:15:26] why spend one more night with a bunch of
[1:15:28] plagues falling all around you why spend
[1:15:30] one more night Let it go Let the Body
[1:15:33] die
[1:15:34] let the old flesh and your old feelings
[1:15:37] and the old things die away

[1:15:41] on the fourth day
[1:15:44] Sunday Monday Tuesday Wednesday
[1:15:47] if you gather on Wednesday Monday
[1:15:49] Tuesday Wednesday Thursday get rid of it

[1:16:01] all right say well they haven't let it
[1:16:03] go it doesn't matter
[1:16:05] but don't you want them Jewels yeah
[1:16:08] don't you want that Joy don't you want
[1:16:10] that peace don't don't look away for
[1:16:11] them to let it go you can take it from

[1:16:51] know when I didn't have a way to go he
[1:16:53] blessed me in the valley it's spite of
[1:16:56] my struggles in spite of my
[1:16:57] circumstances he blessed me anyway

[1:17:05] called the valley of Baraka and to this
