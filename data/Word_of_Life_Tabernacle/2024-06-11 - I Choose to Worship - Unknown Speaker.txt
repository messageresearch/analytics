========================================

[Music] when my heart is broken when my life is empty I can't see your face I can't hear your voice when I'm feeling helpless wondering in the darkness surrounded by fear and defeat I have a choice to make no matter what comes my way I choose to worship I choose to praise I choose to lift up the name above all names I choose surrender I choose to believe for all that you've done and for all that will be I choose to worship even in the fire even in the Valle I can have joy and I can have peace you are always with me never will forsake me your presence is all I'll ever need and I have a choice CH to make with all that I am I Proclaim I choose to worship I choose to praise I choose to lift up the name above all names I choose surrender I choose to believe for all that you've done and for for all there will be I choose to worship though we are pressed on every side faith is our weapon and we'll win this fight we've made our choice and we lift our voice Let the church rise up and say oh we will say we choose to worship we choose to praise we choose to lift up the name above all names we choose surrender we choose to believe for all that you've done and for all that will be I choose to worship oh I choose to worship I choose to worship [Applause]
