[53:21] to come to church so
[53:22] glad to have him today do you love the
[53:25] Lord I know I already asked that but
[53:27] nobody said amen so ask it one more time
[53:29] do you love the Lord
[53:31] amen I believe you do or you wouldn't be
[53:33] in church this morning Hebrews chapter
[53:36] 13 and verse 10.
[53:39] read down through verse 16.
[53:48] I want us to pay close attention to the
[53:50] word this morning not that you don't
[53:51] anyway but
[53:53] there's just some things I'd like to say
[53:55] and and we want to get all the way
[53:57] through it I don't want to
[53:59] I don't want to get distracted or get
[54:02] you thinking about something else we
[54:03] need to think spiritually and not
[54:05] carnally today
[54:06] but I'd like to
[54:08] title my sermon today honey we need to
[54:11] talk
[54:13] I know that's a little bit odd but you
[54:14] just bear with me and we'll get to it
[54:16] Hebrews chapter 13 and verse 10.
[54:21] it says we have an altar whereof they
[54:23] have no right to eat which serve the
[54:24] Tabernacle
[54:26] for the bodies of those beasts whose
[54:28] blood is brought into the sanctuary by
[54:30] the high priest for sin are burned
[54:32] without the camp wherefore Jesus also we
[54:37] might sanctify the people with his own
[54:38] blood suffered without the gate
[54:41] he said let us go forth therefore unto
[54:44] him without the camp bearing his
[54:47] reproach
[54:48] for here we have no continuing City but
[54:51] we seek one to come
[54:54] by him therefore let us offer the
[54:56] sacrifice of praise to God continually
[54:59] you want to do that this morning
[55:02] continually that is the fruit of our
[55:04] lips giving thanks to his name
[55:07] but to do good
[55:10] and to communicate forget not
[55:13] for with such sacrifices
[55:16] it's a sacrifice
[55:18] God is well pleased pray the Lord
[55:21] without his Blessing to the word you may
[55:22] be seated
[55:25] I was pleased with the wedding yesterday
[55:26] as well I thought things went real
[55:28] smoothly and praying the best for that
[55:30] young couple
[55:33] there's no words I don't think that are
[55:36] more dreaded by a man than to hear his
[55:38] wife say honey we need to talk
[55:43] now you just be honest this morning I I
[55:46] think that's probably true because so
[55:49] many times we don't know what we did
[55:53] and
[55:56] and yet nothing good happens in a in a
[55:59] in a partnership in a marriage in a
[56:02] business in a church without
[56:04] communication
[56:07] in fact the Bible tells us that by faith
[56:09] we understand that the worlds were
[56:11] framed by the word of God
[56:15] by the communication of God to the Earth
[56:19] and you know his thoughts were always
[56:22] there the thoughts of God are Eternal
[56:25] how many know that his thoughts are
[56:27] eternally they were always there but it
[56:29] was not his thoughts that produced a son
[56:32] it was not his thoughts that produced an
[56:35] earth it was not his thoughts but it was
[56:37] his word which is his thought expressed
[56:41] so it is not by you are not healed by
[56:44] just the thought of God but you are
[56:46] healed by the expression of God in the
[56:49] word he sent his word and healed them
[56:51] aren't you glad he talked aren't you
[56:53] glad he communicated with you and he
[56:56] caused you to be able to understand
[56:57] that's what the message of the hour is
[57:00] in our days of communication of God to
[57:04] us he talked to us he said honey we need
[57:07] to have a talk and and it was not us
[57:09] talking to him it was him speaking in
[57:12] this age and saying we need to talk
[57:16] and he come down in my situation in your
[57:18] situation into the part of the world
[57:20] that you were in and said we need to
[57:22] talk and when he did what happened he
[57:24] began to communicate to us how much he
[57:26] loves us and what our future home will
[57:28] be and everything about he began to
[57:30] communicate with us all the things we
[57:33] needed to know to get out of here
[57:36] aren't you glad for that today
[57:38] God communicating his thoughts
[57:42] she glad he didn't just sit there and
[57:43] take it yes
[57:48] well I I think healing I'm so glad that
[57:51] he said I know the thoughts
[57:54] that I have towards you and he didn't
[57:55] stop there
[57:57] thoughts of peace
[58:00] thoughts of healing
[58:02] to give you an expected end
[58:04] he tells us what the thoughts are
[58:08] that's right he doesn't just leave us
[58:09] with thoughts
[58:11] and we believe we are a thought of God
[58:13] we're in his thoughts but that's not
[58:15] where it ends we become a manifestation
[58:18] which is what a word is is a
[58:20] manifestation of thought
[58:23] oh you might say well I I spoke without
[58:25] thinking but that's technically
[58:27] impossible you just didn't think
[58:29] correctly
[58:31] before he spoke
[58:34] so Paul is telling the people he said
[58:37] two things to do good and communicate
[58:42] right do good that's that's pretty
[58:44] self-explanatory
[58:46] and he said communicate and the word
[58:48] communicate is in the scripture is
[58:50] Koinonia it's an important uh Greek word
[58:53] in the New Testament it speaks of
[58:55] sharing participation it speaks of
[58:58] commonality solidarity shared
[59:00] responsibility among households or
[59:03] individuals so it's more than just
[59:05] speech but it's it's a sharing of words
[59:08] or a sharing of finances or sharing of
[59:11] ideas or sharing of suffering the Bible
[59:14] speaks of all kinds of different types
[59:16] of Koinonia and so it speaks of a shared
[59:19] conviction a mutual responsibility a
[59:22] mutual status sharing of resources and
[59:26] so here in uh here in the Scripture it
[59:29] speaks of when it speaks of this
[59:30] Koinonia it's talking about two people
[59:33] that are communicating in such a way
[59:36] that they can they they can work
[59:37] together and that's what the church is
[59:40] supposed to be that's what a house is
[59:42] supposed to be it's not one-sided it's
[59:44] two people both sharing with one another
[59:47] and producing something for some purpose
[59:50] for some uh for some a goal that they
[59:53] share together and so in in this case
[59:56] Paul is talking about Koinonia that the
[59:59] Saints in the Greek world the Saints in
[1:00:01] in the Philippians and the Saints in the
[1:00:04] Corinthians they had to share with the
[1:00:06] Jerusalem believers they had to share
[1:00:09] their resources because they had money
[1:00:11] and the Jerusalem Believers were in a
[1:00:12] drought and so they took up an offering
[1:00:15] and they shared with them just like we
[1:00:16] do today when we share with the
[1:00:18] Believers of Malawi or we share with the
[1:00:20] believer in sin that the Philippines you
[1:00:22] all have done that before or in Africa
[1:00:25] somewhere we're giving something to them
[1:00:27] because we we're sharing we're
[1:00:29] communicating with them and they let us
[1:00:32] know and I'll ask the brothers what are
[1:00:34] the needs that you have and they'll say
[1:00:35] well we need this and that and and we'll
[1:00:38] present the need to the church and and
[1:00:39] then we share with them of our abundance
[1:00:42] yeah
[1:00:43] all right so that's Koinonia sharing one
[1:00:47] of the meanings
[1:00:48] now Paul
[1:00:50] writes to the Philippians and he uses
[1:00:52] this word in Philippians 4. now he's
[1:00:54] just written to the Philippians from
[1:00:55] prison
[1:00:57] from prison
[1:00:59] and he tells him rejoice in the lord
[1:01:01] always
[1:01:02] yeah again I say rejoice he he writes to
[1:01:04] them and he says he he says whatever
[1:01:06] things are good whatever things are
[1:01:08] lovely you all know the scripture
[1:01:10] Philippians 4 but he goes on after he
[1:01:13] says that writing again from from a
[1:01:16] prison house and he's communicating with
[1:01:19] them
[1:01:19] about their communication with him and I
[1:01:23] wonder if this epistle had would ever
[1:01:25] have been written had they not
[1:01:27] communicated with him
[1:01:29] and let him know that they were still
[1:01:31] there
[1:01:32] and the way that they did that by what
[1:01:34] was by sending him money
[1:01:36] has actually happened that they sent him
[1:01:39] basically a care package or money or
[1:01:41] some some way of this or maybe food but
[1:01:44] they sent him resources so he could be
[1:01:46] able to live because he was in prison
[1:01:48] and they wanted him to be cared for
[1:01:50] while he was there so they were sharing
[1:01:52] with him I hope I'm not boring you this
[1:01:54] morning but we need to understand these
[1:01:57] things we we do you may not think that
[1:02:00] you do but you do
[1:02:03] I do too
[1:02:05] they were sharing with one another
[1:02:08] and so he says in verse 10 but I
[1:02:09] rejoiced in the Lord greatly aren't you
[1:02:12] glad you can Rejoice even in prison
[1:02:14] aren't you glad that your circumstances
[1:02:16] don't they don't don't take your praise
[1:02:18] away when your circumstances go down so
[1:02:21] JT you might end up in the hospital but
[1:02:23] you still there's something about you
[1:02:24] you can there's still a worship there to
[1:02:26] God God I'm in pain but you're still
[1:02:28] worthy I'm hurting but you're still
[1:02:31] worthy of my praise
[1:02:35] so he said your care he said I Rejoice
[1:02:39] that your care has flourished again so
[1:02:42] they had given in the past
[1:02:43] he said now they're giving again
[1:02:46] he said we're in you were also careful
[1:02:47] what he means by that is that you cared
[1:02:49] about the situation but you lacked
[1:02:51] opportunity
[1:02:53] he said not that I speak in respect of
[1:02:55] want now remember he's riding from
[1:02:57] prison yes I love this he said I have
[1:03:00] learned in whatever state I am there was
[1:03:04] to be content
[1:03:06] whatever state I'm in I want to be
[1:03:09] content don't you
[1:03:11] and he's speaking again from prison
[1:03:14] he's in a rotten fested hole in the
[1:03:17] ground
[1:03:19] and he's writing to the people and he
[1:03:21] says I can do all things
[1:03:25] look at verse 12. I can do or verse 13
[1:03:29] rather all things somebody could send
[1:03:32] him into that today I can do all things
[1:03:35] he was in prison people thought he was
[1:03:37] crazy Paul what are you doing right and
[1:03:39] I can do all things when you're in
[1:03:40] prison you don't even have two coats you
[1:03:42] don't have anything people have forsaken
[1:03:44] you all over the world people have
[1:03:46] turned against the messenger the hour
[1:03:47] people don't how can you say I can do
[1:03:49] all things he wasn't talking about
[1:03:51] himself but he said through Christ which
[1:03:53] strengtheneth me I believe this morning
[1:03:55] that you and I can say I can do all
[1:03:58] things
[1:03:59] I can do all things regardless of
[1:04:01] circumstance regardless of where I'm at
[1:04:03] in my life and how much money I do or
[1:04:05] don't have in my bank account I can do
[1:04:07] all things
[1:04:09] through Christ which strengtheneth me
[1:04:13] he said notwithstanding you have well
[1:04:14] done
[1:04:16] he said it's not because I needed it
[1:04:17] that I'm writing this to you but I'm
[1:04:19] thanking you
[1:04:20] he said that you did communicate with my
[1:04:22] affliction
[1:04:24] you communicated
[1:04:26] you showed me you cared
[1:04:28] I got that letter I got that card I got
[1:04:30] that
[1:04:31] that gift
[1:04:33] I I could have lived without it
[1:04:36] but you showed me you cared old church
[1:04:38] if we could only learn to communicate
[1:04:40] like that
[1:04:42] it's not all about the gift itself but
[1:04:45] it's the thought behind it you've heard
[1:04:46] that many times
[1:04:48] but yet it it's really true it's
[1:04:50] communication
[1:04:52] he said now you Philippians know also
[1:04:54] but in the beginning of the Gospel when
[1:04:57] I departed from Macedonia no church
[1:05:00] communicated with me
[1:05:02] as concerning giving and receiving but
[1:05:05] she only
[1:05:06] yeah he said for even in thessalonica
[1:05:08] you sent once and again unto my
[1:05:10] necessity
[1:05:12] not because I desire a gift but I desire
[1:05:15] fruit that may abound
[1:05:17] to your account
[1:05:20] they were in communion with him so when
[1:05:23] they saw he had a need they were in
[1:05:25] communication they saw he had a need
[1:05:26] they were in Koinonia
[1:05:28] so they communicated by giving to
[1:05:31] that need now I want us to go all the
[1:05:34] way back to the beginning well those are
[1:05:35] scary words when a preacher says them
[1:05:37] aren't they because anytime a preacher
[1:05:39] starts in Genesis Anything Could Happen
[1:05:42] but I want us to go all the way back to
[1:05:44] the beginning we're going to read
[1:05:45] Genesis 2 18. but I want you to think
[1:05:47] about Adam for a moment because Adam was
[1:05:49] living the single life
[1:05:52] right he had everything going good for
[1:05:53] him and I've been thinking about
[1:05:55] marriage because the young couple that's
[1:05:56] gotten married and other young couples
[1:05:58] that have gotten married recently most
[1:05:59] of them aren't here this morning but
[1:06:01] you're here and no matter how long
[1:06:02] you've been married then you still need
[1:06:04] to learn to communicate with each other
[1:06:06] and
[1:06:07] and in the beginning that that God see
[1:06:10] Adam was alone he was single if you're
[1:06:11] single this morning uh we content in
[1:06:14] that state
[1:06:15] right you don't have to you know amen my
[1:06:18] mother says well praise the Lord
[1:06:23] so be content in that state
[1:06:27] so anyway it's uh boy that threw me
[1:06:32] I'm trying to get her married off and
[1:06:33] here she is
[1:06:35] but I said it's still the truth anyway
[1:06:37] if you're single be content
[1:06:41] but now and but he had the perfect setup
[1:06:44] think about it
[1:06:46] yeah Adam had the perfect setup but he
[1:06:49] had no one to communicate with
[1:06:52] yeah and you might say well if it was
[1:06:54] just me and God we get along pretty good
[1:06:56] I don't need a church
[1:06:58] I don't need a wife I don't need a
[1:07:00] family it'd just be me and God
[1:07:02] we'll see how well that went for Adam
[1:07:04] yeah
[1:07:06] the Lord God said
[1:07:08] it is not good that the man should be
[1:07:12] alone
[1:07:13] and will make him a help meet for him
[1:07:16] now and I'll watch that
[1:07:18] verse 19 out of the ground the Lord God
[1:07:20] formed every Beast to the field every
[1:07:22] fowl of the air and brought them unto
[1:07:24] Adam to see what he would call them
[1:07:25] whatsoever Adam called every living
[1:07:27] creature that was the name thereof and
[1:07:30] Adam gave names to all cattle into the
[1:07:32] fowl of the air to every beast of the
[1:07:34] field but for Adam there was not found a
[1:07:37] help meet for him I want you to think
[1:07:39] deep for a moment
[1:07:41] what did Adam need help with
[1:07:47] think about it
[1:07:48] he was able to speak
[1:07:51] and things would appear
[1:07:54] what did he need help with
[1:07:56] he didn't have any laundry
[1:08:05] there were no dishes to wash that we
[1:08:07] know of
[1:08:08] we know he didn't have any laundry
[1:08:12] so it wasn't like there was big piles of
[1:08:14] laundry all over the garden and God
[1:08:16] looks down and says Adam needs help
[1:08:21] right it wasn't that couldn't be that
[1:08:25] so now it wasn't bad it was not dishes
[1:08:29] but listen to what brother Brandon says
[1:08:30] he said before he made man he called
[1:08:33] himself see God has a right to name
[1:08:35] himself
[1:08:37] right he called himself
[1:08:39] Eli Elohim
[1:08:42] he said the word means in the Hebrew the
[1:08:44] self-existence all by himself
[1:08:47] nothing existed before him
[1:08:50] he was all the existence there ever was
[1:08:54] self-existence one
[1:08:56] El Ila Elohim means the all-sufficient
[1:08:59] all-powerful almighty self-existent one
[1:09:03] you know we could call him the single
[1:09:05] God
[1:09:08] the unmarried God
[1:09:11] right the single God but he had
[1:09:13] everything
[1:09:15] right but he did not have communication
[1:09:20] oh God
[1:09:21] look
[1:09:23] and in Genesis 2 he said when he made
[1:09:26] man he said I am
[1:09:29] y-a-h-u-j-u-v-u-h Yahweh Jehovah what
[1:09:32] did it mean I am the all self-existence
[1:09:34] one now watch I'm the all-existent one
[1:09:36] who has created something
[1:09:40] off of myself
[1:09:42] to be a son of mine to be a temporary or
[1:09:46] an amateur little one of mine
[1:09:49] I love that you don't learn that down at
[1:09:52] the Baptist Church
[1:09:54] so now the self-existent hello him
[1:09:57] said I'm going to create something off
[1:09:59] of myself
[1:10:02] the quietest morning but you're
[1:10:03] listening I like it
[1:10:04] watch it easy eating something off of
[1:10:07] himself he's making of himself the
[1:10:10] self-existent God he made something a
[1:10:13] little God
[1:10:15] all right so it's no longer Elohim
[1:10:19] oh my Elohim is his self-existing name
[1:10:22] Jehovah or Yahweh whatever that however
[1:10:25] that was pronounced in the Old Testament
[1:10:27] that that was his name of God but now in
[1:10:31] in in this time his name is Jesus
[1:10:34] that's his his bridegroom name
[1:10:37] it's Jesus now he gave man to be he said
[1:10:41] Jehovah means that he gave man to be an
[1:10:45] amateur God
[1:10:47] because he is Father God and he made man
[1:10:51] an amateur God so he isn't
[1:10:54] self-existence anymore I love this he's
[1:10:58] not single no more it's not without a
[1:11:01] family anymore he exists with his family
[1:11:05] Eli Eli Elohim he said now he is Jehovah
[1:11:08] Jehovah meaning the one who exists with
[1:11:10] his family
[1:11:11] he said now God made man to be the
[1:11:13] predominant over all the Earth he had
[1:11:15] dominion and the Earth was man's
[1:11:17] Dominion he said is that scripture then
[1:11:20] if that's his domain he was God over the
[1:11:22] Earth
[1:11:23] he could speak and it would be so he
[1:11:26] could speak this and it would be so
[1:11:29] he did not need help with washing the
[1:11:31] dishes
[1:11:36] he did not need help with washing the
[1:11:38] baseboards
[1:11:40] or keeping the house
[1:11:43] oh my remember the dual covenant didn't
[1:11:46] exist till after Eden
[1:11:48] right where she would take care of the
[1:11:50] home he would take care of the field
[1:11:53] and work at the sweat of his brow and
[1:11:55] she would take care of the home and
[1:11:56] children would be born in sorrow
[1:11:59] but they would work we found that out
[1:12:00] not long ago where the brand who said
[1:12:01] Heaven is a real place just like this he
[1:12:03] said we work and he said but there's no
[1:12:05] toil in it no anxious toil
[1:12:07] and so the work that we have would be
[1:12:09] different because there's no anxiety in
[1:12:12] that work but now that's the way his
[1:12:14] work was in the Garden of Eden so what
[1:12:15] does he need
[1:12:17] what did he need help with
[1:12:19] he was lonely
[1:12:22] he needed somebody to talk to
[1:12:25] then we shouldn't complain when our
[1:12:27] wives want to talk
[1:12:32] literally what they were made to do yeah
[1:12:37] yeah
[1:12:42] that's called positive effect to you
[1:12:45] young preachers you know
[1:12:48] think about it for a minute
[1:12:50] shouldn't complain about that
[1:12:53] he was lonely
[1:12:55] he needed something yeah yeah so God
[1:12:58] removed the feminist part from Adam
[1:13:00] which was unexpressed because brother
[1:13:02] Brown said he wasn't like what we have
[1:13:04] today a man don't know if he's a woman
[1:13:05] or a man but he he was expressed it in a
[1:13:08] certain form and God removed the
[1:13:09] feminist part
[1:13:11] and then the feminine part become the
[1:13:13] woman and he was the masculine the man
[1:13:16] now what did he need partnership
[1:13:18] fulfillment because by dividing only God
[1:13:22] can divide one substance and make more
[1:13:24] of it than what it was in the original
[1:13:26] that's that's the way to understand the
[1:13:28] godhead by the way
[1:13:30] only God can do that
[1:13:33] so now Adam
[1:13:35] now Adam
[1:13:36] had not did not need anything done he
[1:13:41] needed somebody
[1:13:43] yeah see and the same thing goes with
[1:13:44] your spiritual walk with God you can't
[1:13:47] come to God saying I need this done I
[1:13:49] need that done I need that I need this I
[1:13:51] need that but you come to God Lord I
[1:13:53] need you
[1:13:55] I want you I want communion with you I
[1:13:58] want partnership with you I don't want
[1:14:00] things I don't want gifts I want the
[1:14:02] giver and then he'll give gifts he'll do
[1:14:05] things but I don't want the things
[1:14:09] foreign
[1:14:10] my wife always jokes with me and tells
[1:14:12] me that she married me for my money
[1:14:15] that is a joke
[1:14:20] but
[1:14:21] really I think she wanted me
[1:14:24] because there wasn't much else
[1:14:27] that I had to offer
[1:14:29] of my job at Burger King
[1:14:34] are you with me now
[1:14:37] it wasn't a whole lot I I saw that she
[1:14:39] would be a good mother and I saw she
[1:14:41] would be a good housekeeper and I saw
[1:14:43] all of those things but that's not what
[1:14:45] I really wanted what I really wanted was
[1:14:47] her what she really what you really want
[1:14:49] from God what do you want today if you
[1:14:51] approach God and say well I want healing
[1:14:53] I want I want this I want my life to go
[1:14:55] better what do you want from God you
[1:14:57] should want him
[1:14:59] I want you I need you I don't need
[1:15:01] anything else
[1:15:08] no
[1:15:10] if the only reason you get married is to
[1:15:12] satisfy lust
[1:15:13] or to have someone to do chores around
[1:15:15] the house
[1:15:17] or to have someone to protect you from
[1:15:19] danger
[1:15:20] or make you better off financially
[1:15:23] it will end in divorce most of the time
[1:15:27] why
[1:15:29] you think about this
[1:15:31] was an incredibly strong marriage
[1:15:34] that God performed in the Garden of Eden
[1:15:38] because it survived the worst thing that
[1:15:40] can happen to a marriage
[1:15:45] the worst thing
[1:15:47] and Adam stayed with his wife now why
[1:15:50] did he not put her away
[1:15:52] no we know that we know what he did
[1:15:56] right we know that Adam did not put her
[1:15:58] away that he went out with her we know
[1:16:00] that he was her Redeemer in that sense
[1:16:03] and yet he could not die for her because
[1:16:05] he had sinned as well
[1:16:07] but we know what he did but but why
[1:16:10] why look at Genesis 2 21 the Lord God
[1:16:12] caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam
[1:16:14] and he slept and he took one of his ribs
[1:16:16] and closed up the Flesh and stood
[1:16:18] thereof and the rib which the Lord God
[1:16:20] had taken from man made he a woman and
[1:16:23] he brought her to the man and Adam said
[1:16:25] this is now bone of my bones Flesh of My
[1:16:28] Flesh she shall be called woman because
[1:16:30] she was taken out of man therefore shall
[1:16:34] a man leave his father and his mother
[1:16:35] and shall cleave unto his wife and they
[1:16:37] shall be one flesh
[1:16:40] and they were both naked the man and his
[1:16:42] wife and they were not
[1:16:45] ashamed
[1:16:46] think about that now they had complete
[1:16:49] Koinonia with one another
[1:16:51] that complete Fellowship nothing was
[1:16:53] hidden everything was right
[1:16:57] remember when Jesus was tempted by the
[1:16:59] Pharisees they come to him and said is
[1:17:01] it lawful for a man to put away his wife
[1:17:03] tempting him
[1:17:05] Mark 10 2.
[1:17:07] and he answered and said it to them what
[1:17:08] did Moses command you
[1:17:10] they said Moses suffered to write a bill
[1:17:12] of divorce but to put her away and Jesus
[1:17:15] answered and said unto them for the
[1:17:16] hardness of your heart he wrote you this
[1:17:18] precept but from the beginning of the
[1:17:20] creation God made them male and female
[1:17:24] counterparts
[1:17:26] right one is not whole without the other
[1:17:29] for this cause shall a man leave his
[1:17:31] father and mother and cleave to his wife
[1:17:33] and they twain shall be one flesh so
[1:17:37] then they are no more Twain but one
[1:17:38] flesh what therefore God had joined
[1:17:40] together
[1:17:42] let not man put asunder he's describing
[1:17:45] to you why Adam did what he did because
[1:17:48] God joined them as one flesh he could
[1:17:50] not tear off Eve
[1:17:52] without getting rid of a part of himself
[1:17:57] so when he fell he fell with her but
[1:18:00] when the second Adam came and he died
[1:18:02] for our sins and he rose again on the
[1:18:04] third day when he raised we raised with
[1:18:07] him we could not be separated from him
[1:18:12] Hallelujah
[1:18:18] now tells us all of that I don't have
[1:18:20] time to read the quotes this morning but
[1:18:21] listen don't you see what Jesus did
[1:18:24] he communicated yeah
[1:18:26] with our sufferings
[1:18:28] he participated what was Adam doing he
[1:18:31] was communicating he was in a Koinonia
[1:18:34] with Eve and they had to go out together
[1:18:39] Jesus participated he didn't remain God
[1:18:42] in heaven but he changed his mask he
[1:18:45] changed his form and he came down and
[1:18:49] communicated with our sufferings he
[1:18:51] condescended he became us so we could
[1:18:53] become him and what God joined together
[1:18:56] let no man separate what God joined
[1:18:59] together no preacher can separate what
[1:19:02] God batting his thoughts and expressed
[1:19:04] in his word let no man put asunder we
[1:19:07] don't have a right to mess with the word
[1:19:08] and we don't have a right to mess with
[1:19:10] God's people we cannot take them out of
[1:19:13] the I didn't put you in I can't take you
[1:19:15] out
[1:19:16] if you were in the mind of God what can
[1:19:18] separate you from that kind of a love
[1:19:20] nothing
[1:19:22] stay with me this morning nothing
[1:19:25] what can who will separate us from the
[1:19:27] love of Christ nothing what God joined
[1:19:29] together let no man put asunder
[1:19:35] I heard I read in the message where
[1:19:37] brother man told the story about the
[1:19:39] couple fighting you remember the story
[1:19:40] they're about to get a divorce
[1:19:42] they're fighting and fussing they go up
[1:19:44] the attic they're divided everything
[1:19:45] they go up to the Attic
[1:19:48] they didn't have nothing in common it
[1:19:49] seemed like but they go and they start
[1:19:51] taking stuff out there had been a little
[1:19:53] baby born that died in childbirth and
[1:19:55] they found a little a pair of baby shoes
[1:19:58] and they both grabbed for it when they
[1:20:00] did they realized
[1:20:02] they had something in common
[1:20:04] you can't separate that
[1:20:07] right that's us that's we we that that's
[1:20:11] our Unity brought that to pass there's
[1:20:13] there's no way to separate it
[1:20:16] what God joined together let no man put
[1:20:20] asunder
[1:20:21] we have things in common that's why
[1:20:23] there's such a danger when you begin to
[1:20:25] have fewer and fewer things in common
[1:20:27] and I'm preaching to you older couples
[1:20:29] this morning because many times when the
[1:20:31] kids leave the house you begin to find
[1:20:34] remember brother Perry green said years
[1:20:35] ago there were so many times what
[1:20:38] happened is when the kids leave the
[1:20:39] house the parents discover they hate one
[1:20:41] another
[1:20:43] because they were so busy during the
[1:20:46] time the kids were there that they never
[1:20:48] spent any time they had nothing in
[1:20:49] common yeah
[1:20:50] they were just chauffeurs for the
[1:20:52] children
[1:20:53] and we should be wary of that
[1:20:56] marriage needs communication
[1:20:59] you've got to have things in common
[1:21:02] oh my
[1:21:04] you see the amazing thing I love the
[1:21:06] story of Adam and Eve because the
[1:21:08] amazing thing about them is not that
[1:21:09] they fell apart or that they fell
[1:21:12] but that they stayed together afterwards
[1:21:16] now they were dependent on one another
[1:21:18] they had separate covenants hers was
[1:21:20] childbearing this was worse if they were
[1:21:22] going to get along they had to learn to
[1:21:24] communicate with one another
[1:21:25] for the first time she had to ask him to
[1:21:28] take out the trash
[1:21:31] they didn't have laundry before but now
[1:21:33] they did
[1:21:36] right
[1:21:38] they didn't have any trouble in Eden
[1:21:40] with those things imagine what that must
[1:21:42] have felt like to Adam the first time
[1:21:45] trash
[1:21:49] I'm an amateur God
[1:21:53] I'm I could eat and I could speak man
[1:21:55] when I was single I could hunt anytime I
[1:21:57] wanted to I could
[1:21:59] huh
[1:22:02] but you're not now Adam
[1:22:04] now you got separate Covenants
[1:22:06] now you're living at home and how
[1:22:08] there's laundry to do now there's dishes
[1:22:10] to do
[1:22:11] now there's help
[1:22:13] that needs to be between the two the
[1:22:15] communication
[1:22:17] you realize the church is the same way
[1:22:20] it'll just run off and do our own thing
[1:22:23] yeah right we need each other we
[1:22:26] communicate with each other we've got to
[1:22:29] we've got to because what God puts
[1:22:32] together let's not tear it apart
[1:22:34] placed you here in the church and we
[1:22:37] want you to be here if God has placed
[1:22:39] you here then don't Don't just run off
[1:22:40] doing your own thing but stay a part of
[1:22:43] what's going on try to try to try to be
[1:22:46] a part of of the furtherance of the
[1:22:48] ministry of the church and when the
[1:22:49] church rejoices you rejoice when the
[1:22:51] church suffers you suffer
[1:22:53] we're being a part of so so proud so
[1:22:55] many of you showed up to the wedding
[1:22:57] what are you doing it's not your wedding
[1:22:58] it's not related to many of you but you
[1:23:01] showed up why because it's a part of you
[1:23:06] yeah
[1:23:09] there's two types of people you should
[1:23:10] never marry
[1:23:14] should never marry an unbeliever you
[1:23:15] know the Bible teaches that right
[1:23:17] should never marry an unbeliever second
[1:23:19] Corinthians 6 14 be not unequally yoked
[1:23:22] together with unbelievers we'll read the
[1:23:24] rest of that and the next verses in a
[1:23:26] minute
[1:23:27] but the Bible said no believer should
[1:23:29] ever marry an unbeliever under no
[1:23:31] circumstances
[1:23:33] this goes to my kids if nobody else
[1:23:35] right
[1:23:36] they're not old enough to get married
[1:23:37] here another 20 years or so they will be
[1:23:41] no believer should ever marry an
[1:23:43] unbeliever
[1:23:44] there are no circumstances should always
[1:23:46] marry Believers he said brother Ben I
[1:23:48] Married An unbeliever well God has Grace
[1:23:51] and I've seen it work out
[1:23:53] but it doesn't change the word
[1:23:55] no believer should ever marry an
[1:23:57] unbeliever because you always there
[1:23:59] always be problems in the home
[1:24:01] you should wait if that person comes
[1:24:03] into the church you should wait until
[1:24:04] that believer has been sealed by the
[1:24:06] Holy Ghost
[1:24:07] I don't mean that they danced at camp
[1:24:10] or they jumped around a little bit they
[1:24:12] got excited I love that I believe in
[1:24:14] that but that's not being born again
[1:24:18] right you could have two people have the
[1:24:20] same sensation the same emotion one God
[1:24:21] at the other didn't watch their life
[1:24:25] what kind of Life do they have and what
[1:24:28] kind of a what kind of thing that's the
[1:24:29] thing brother random the standard that I
[1:24:31] can see that brother Branham held for
[1:24:32] his children was not so much how they
[1:24:35] dated and or how they corded if that's
[1:24:37] the right word we get all involved in
[1:24:39] how things are done but Branham is much
[1:24:41] more interested in who
[1:24:44] if you look he's much more interested in
[1:24:46] who and then when you find that who that
[1:24:48] person even let George and Rebecca get
[1:24:50] engaged but he wouldn't let him get
[1:24:51] married because he didn't have the Holy
[1:24:52] Ghost
[1:24:55] and when he did then it was it's time to
[1:24:57] get married
[1:24:58] right because you can't you can't just
[1:25:01] put people together that don't have
[1:25:03] similar don't have similar tastes don't
[1:25:06] have similar desires and you cannot have
[1:25:08] the desires of God without the Holy
[1:25:11] Ghost
[1:25:13] second Corinthians 6 14 be not unequally
[1:25:15] yoked together with unbelievers for what
[1:25:17] Fellowship hath righteousness with
[1:25:18] unrighteousness what communion there's
[1:25:20] that word again Koinonia that's light
[1:25:22] with Darkness yeah what Concord hath
[1:25:25] Christ with Belial what part has he that
[1:25:28] believeth with an Infidel what agreement
[1:25:30] hath the temple of God with Idols for
[1:25:32] you are the Temple of the Living God
[1:25:34] you're filled with the Holy Spirit
[1:25:35] you're sealed away into the presence of
[1:25:37] God what how can you have fellowship
[1:25:40] with an eye an idolater
[1:25:42] God has said I would dwell in him and
[1:25:44] walk in him I will be their God they
[1:25:45] should be my people you say I'm already
[1:25:47] in a relationship like that where my
[1:25:48] husband or my wife doesn't believe then
[1:25:50] you should do everything you can to be a
[1:25:52] good husband and a good wife and by the
[1:25:54] comp by your lifestyle they can be one
[1:25:56] that's what the scripture says
[1:25:58] but yet you cannot join in the idolatry
[1:26:01] yeah
[1:26:05] until the sanctuary has been cleansed
[1:26:08] Idol's removed the holy spirit in
[1:26:10] Residence the temple will continue to be
[1:26:13] taken right
[1:26:14] and it needs a rebirth it needs a
[1:26:17] cleansing oh every one of us do today if
[1:26:19] you're born in sin shape and iniquity
[1:26:21] come in the world speaking lies you need
[1:26:23] the Holy Ghost
[1:26:25] do we believe that today
[1:26:28] do you love the Lord this morning
[1:26:32] see we will be the product of the nature
[1:26:34] and nurture of our genes until the Holy
[1:26:37] Spirit begins to rule in our life
[1:26:41] and then he doesn't take those away but
[1:26:43] he overrules them
[1:26:45] right that's why when you would do
[1:26:47] something you'd do something that was
[1:26:49] wrong in the Holy Spirit if he's on in
[1:26:51] Residence and you haven't grieved him
[1:26:53] he's there to tell you no don't do that
[1:26:56] right and a Christian stops
[1:26:59] right and listens to the leading of the
[1:27:00] Holy Spirit and those who walk in the
[1:27:03] spirit won't fulfill the lust of the
[1:27:04] flesh so we will be the product of our
[1:27:06] of our upbringing and our genes
[1:27:10] man that Gene thing's a problem but
[1:27:12] Andrew touched on that while he was here
[1:27:14] I believe it was brother Andrew that
[1:27:15] preaches on that that's a real problem
[1:27:17] isn't it because if you go looking at
[1:27:19] your family I've had two phone calls
[1:27:21] recently of second cousins of mine who
[1:27:23] were looking because they found because
[1:27:25] I did my DNA and put it on ancestry.com
[1:27:27] and there was there's people on there
[1:27:29] that found me and I've had two calls
[1:27:31] from second cousins who don't know who
[1:27:33] their father is
[1:27:35] wanting to find their father and they're
[1:27:37] my age
[1:27:38] and but they're second cousins of mine
[1:27:40] and I got to thinking about that and I
[1:27:42] thought oh God what would that be
[1:27:44] without your grace what would I be
[1:27:46] without your love I'm not better in my
[1:27:49] own flesh than anybody else but God by
[1:27:51] the by his grace brought me to this
[1:27:53] place by his grace if you're here this
[1:27:55] morning you're not better than anybody
[1:27:56] else you may have failed spectacularly
[1:27:59] Paul said such were some of you but
[1:28:01] you've been lost you've been Sanctified
[1:28:03] you've been washed by the blood of the
[1:28:05] Lamb yes you should not be all in the
[1:28:08] moly grubs about what you were but you
[1:28:10] should be excited and worshipful and
[1:28:11] praising God for what you are today
[1:28:17] this nature that we have the Bible calls
[1:28:19] it carnality
[1:28:21] carnality
[1:28:23] First Corinthians 3 1 said our Brethren
[1:28:25] could not speak unto you as in the
[1:28:26] spiritual but as in the carnal even as
[1:28:28] in the babes in Christ fed you with milk
[1:28:30] and not with meat for you are not able
[1:28:32] to Bear it neither yet now are you able
[1:28:34] you're yet carnal whereas there's among
[1:28:36] you envying and strife and divisions are
[1:28:38] you not carnal and walk as men see how
[1:28:41] different this is from the Philippian
[1:28:42] church that he wrote to and said hey I
[1:28:43] want to thank you for having communion
[1:28:45] with my sufferings communicating with me
[1:28:49] and here's this carnal Church
[1:28:52] no communication right
[1:28:54] right
[1:28:55] because they're they're divided among
[1:28:57] themselves
[1:28:59] he said you're carnal
[1:29:01] you see you must receive the spirit and
[1:29:03] then walk in at Galatians 5 16 this I
[1:29:05] say then walk in the spirit you shall
[1:29:07] not fulfill the lust or the desire of
[1:29:09] the flesh
[1:29:10] but the Brown says today and I want to
[1:29:12] read this quote this this is it but it's
[1:29:14] a rather lengthy quote but this is
[1:29:16] I want to get to this and we'll close
[1:29:18] this morning
[1:29:19] now brother Randall said people today a
[1:29:21] lot of modernists believe that the days
[1:29:23] of Miracles are passed we don't believe
[1:29:25] that do we
[1:29:26] don't believe there is such a thing as a
[1:29:28] miracle
[1:29:29] but yet I believe the world is full of
[1:29:32] Miracles
[1:29:33] the Lord whether we're going to preach
[1:29:34] on miracles on on Wednesday night
[1:29:36] because that's a gift of the spirit he
[1:29:39] said the world is full of Miracles he
[1:29:41] said I believe the Paradox is constantly
[1:29:45] he said for instance I believe that
[1:29:48] every born-again member of the body of
[1:29:50] Christ is a paradox in themselves
[1:29:53] I believe each one of you Methodist and
[1:29:55] Presbyterian and Lutheran that never had
[1:29:58] experienced the baptism of the Holy
[1:30:00] Ghost was in some formal Church it did
[1:30:02] not believe in the genuine New Birth has
[1:30:04] now received the baptism of the Holy
[1:30:06] Ghost is a perfect example of a paradox
[1:30:09] look at your neighbor if you have one
[1:30:11] this morning and say you're a perfect
[1:30:12] example of a paradox
[1:30:19] you're a miracle
[1:30:21] something that cannot be explained
[1:30:25] Hallelujah
[1:30:26] he said unless that happens you cannot
[1:30:30] be a Christian
[1:30:31] there must be a paradox for you to
[1:30:34] become a Christian because no one can
[1:30:36] change a spirit in a man and give him
[1:30:38] New Birth outside of God
[1:30:41] God Alone is the only one can do it
[1:30:44] that's why all the counseling that we
[1:30:46] can do over and over and over again and
[1:30:48] I'm happy to do it that's what I'm here
[1:30:50] for I'll do it over and over and over
[1:30:52] I'll be glad to do it but all the
[1:30:53] counseling I can do can only take you so
[1:30:55] far if you're not born again all the
[1:30:58] teaching that we can do how to conduct
[1:30:59] yourself in your home how to do all that
[1:31:01] all the teaching that we can do will
[1:31:03] only take you so far and I'll tell you
[1:31:05] what I don't think much of your
[1:31:06] experience if you can't communicate yeah
[1:31:11] right right hear me Church
[1:31:13] I said but I cried I wept I I spoke in
[1:31:16] tongues but can you communicate and I
[1:31:18] don't mean are you good at it I mean are
[1:31:20] you willing
[1:31:23] it's not are you fluent are you willing
[1:31:26] are you willing to talk to one another
[1:31:28] as a husband in life are you willing to
[1:31:30] communicate with God are you willing to
[1:31:32] communicate with the church it's I'm a
[1:31:34] Christian I just haven't found anybody I
[1:31:36] can get along with you need to check
[1:31:37] your experience
[1:31:39] I'm a Christian I found no church that I
[1:31:41] can be a part of you need to check your
[1:31:43] experience I'm a Christian but I I just
[1:31:45] can't my wife you know I love Jesus but
[1:31:48] I hate my wife you can't do that
[1:31:51] it's literally impossible
[1:31:55] right and vice versa as well
[1:32:00] God's got to change that spirit
[1:32:04] do I know I have the baptism the Holy
[1:32:06] Ghost you need a refilling today fill
[1:32:08] you with love a baptism of Love brother
[1:32:10] Brown calls it yes
[1:32:13] where you can love your neighbor love
[1:32:15] your enemy
[1:32:16] even if that enemy lives in the house
[1:32:18] with you
[1:32:24] God Alone is the only one can do it
[1:32:26] and it's a miracle how that God could
[1:32:28] take a man's thinking in his ways and
[1:32:30] his life and everything and change it
[1:32:32] from what it was to what it can be
[1:32:35] what he can make it
[1:32:38] now you do understand that not
[1:32:39] everything changes at once so a person
[1:32:41] might get born again and those desires
[1:32:44] now his desires are of God but yet his
[1:32:46] ways are untrained remember the Bible
[1:32:49] says train up a child in the way he
[1:32:50] should go and the way he should go in
[1:32:52] the original that's according to his
[1:32:54] bent
[1:32:55] right the child has a certain dent
[1:32:58] because when he's talking about training
[1:33:00] which I was speaking of a bow and he's
[1:33:02] talking about that they would use a
[1:33:03] certain type of wood for a bow and the
[1:33:05] wood would be burnt would be bent a
[1:33:07] certain way and you wouldn't try to turn
[1:33:08] it against the bent but you would use it
[1:33:11] with the bent of the wood
[1:33:13] right and so you have to deal with your
[1:33:15] children like because God made them a
[1:33:16] certain way
[1:33:17] and God made you a certain way allowed
[1:33:19] you to come up a certain way but when
[1:33:21] you received the Holy Ghost it doesn't
[1:33:22] it doesn't immediately it doesn't
[1:33:25] immediately cause you to just be perfect
[1:33:26] in every way but what it does is such
[1:33:29] new desires and you begin to learn new
[1:33:31] behaviors and and you don't have that
[1:33:33] stubbornness that you did you don't have
[1:33:35] that that unbelief that you did and that
[1:33:38] Pride that you did that was keeping it
[1:33:40] away from you but every time you hear
[1:33:41] the word preach and it begins to wash
[1:33:43] over you you begin to conform to it you
[1:33:46] begin to conform to it and slowly God
[1:33:48] Heats it up the wood he heats up the
[1:33:50] wood and he heats up the wood and he
[1:33:52] bends it and he bids he ever seen him
[1:33:53] work with iron or work a blacksmith work
[1:33:56] with iron what's he doing he gets it hot
[1:33:57] and he pounds on it a while and he gets
[1:34:00] it hot and he pounds on it a while
[1:34:01] what's God doing to us all through our
[1:34:03] Christian wall he gets us he Heats us up
[1:34:05] real good puts us in Revival and then he
[1:34:08] pounds on us a while yeah
[1:34:10] and then evangelist comes by we're
[1:34:11] getting Revival then the pastor pounds
[1:34:13] on us for a while
[1:34:15] but what's he doing
[1:34:16] yeah he's making some
[1:34:19] and he's got to get the clay to
[1:34:20] cooperate
[1:34:22] where he wants it to go but without the
[1:34:25] Holy Ghost it'll never cooperate amen
[1:34:27] amen it'll try to go along for a while
[1:34:29] and then it'll fall back
[1:34:30] because it just can't do it
[1:34:33] now watch
[1:34:35] he said only God can do it
[1:34:37] change it from what it was to what it
[1:34:39] can be what he can make it
[1:34:41] he said for instance a few days ago I
[1:34:42] was called in on a scene a little
[1:34:44] something going on there's a fine young
[1:34:45] man a very fine boy I was going with a
[1:34:47] little girl very fine little girl out of
[1:34:49] a fine family this boy all of a sudden
[1:34:51] come up with some kind of an idea and he
[1:34:54] just walked away
[1:34:57] we don't do that from our marriage from
[1:35:00] our home
[1:35:02] in this case it was just he'd promised
[1:35:04] somebody to take her out and didn't
[1:35:07] we don't do that yeah
[1:35:09] yeah we don't treat people like that
[1:35:11] right he failed to communicate he said
[1:35:13] oh just a little deal my kid man he was
[1:35:15] raised right he's okay
[1:35:17] but you watch those things yeah
[1:35:19] you watch for a pattern of that
[1:35:22] right
[1:35:23] I don't know about you I know what's in
[1:35:25] my family
[1:35:26] so I'll watch for those things show up
[1:35:28] in my kids because they're just before
[1:35:29] they're converted they're just
[1:35:30] unconverted me
[1:35:32] and my wife mixed together plus passed
[1:35:35] on genes that may have skipped my
[1:35:36] generation
[1:35:38] that's a problem
[1:35:42] so so what are you gonna do you
[1:35:45] you failed to communicate it seems like
[1:35:47] a little thing
[1:35:49] he went he took what happened is what
[1:35:52] what I've been told is that he he went
[1:35:54] to church
[1:35:55] he was going to take one girl to church
[1:35:56] with him and he took another girl
[1:35:59] and failed to tell the first one
[1:36:01] brother said he did something wrong to
[1:36:03] the little girl and as much as promised
[1:36:04] her to do a certain thing and then
[1:36:06] didn't do it some of you guys
[1:36:09] I'm gonna get myself in trouble some of
[1:36:10] y'all buy new vehicles without talking
[1:36:12] to your wife
[1:36:17] and I'm not saying you sinned
[1:36:20] but listen what if that over and over if
[1:36:23] you do that over and over
[1:36:25] you're not communicating
[1:36:27] yeah boy got quiet
[1:36:29] must have been a lot of that going on
[1:36:31] brother JT
[1:36:38] you failed to communicate now if your
[1:36:39] wife gave you per I gave you permission
[1:36:41] but really
[1:36:44] I mean come on you're one flesh
[1:36:46] tell her about that new bow
[1:36:53] I had him up until then
[1:36:58] and tell him about that new gun
[1:37:02] if you can't tell them about it you
[1:37:04] shouldn't buy it
[1:37:06] same thing with the wife
[1:37:08] I can't tell him about them Amazon
[1:37:10] purchase you shouldn't buy it
[1:37:15] now brother remember he did something
[1:37:17] wrong to the little girl as much as
[1:37:18] promised her to do a certain thing and
[1:37:20] then didn't do it and instead of coming
[1:37:22] to the girl and apologizing like a
[1:37:24] gentleman should do it just wasn't in
[1:37:26] him to do it
[1:37:27] and the father and mother called me to
[1:37:29] the scene said we would desire to know
[1:37:31] what is wrong with our boy
[1:37:33] he said now it's not easy to do sometime
[1:37:35] but you must be truthful and honest he
[1:37:37] said therefore the boy was a Christian
[1:37:38] as far as a Believer he had repented and
[1:37:40] had been baptized had his position among
[1:37:42] the Believers but yet had not received
[1:37:44] the baptism of the Holy Spirit no matter
[1:37:46] how much he thought he had
[1:37:49] he said you thinking you have and having
[1:37:50] it it's two different things
[1:37:52] you might be able to try to say you have
[1:37:54] you might be able to show some evidence
[1:37:56] of some emotion but unless your life is
[1:37:58] vindicating what you're professing to
[1:38:00] have you still haven't got it no matter
[1:38:03] how many emotions how much you jump run
[1:38:05] sensation speaking in tongues or
[1:38:07] shouting or whatever you might lay it
[1:38:09] upon which is all right he said I
[1:38:10] believe in all that too but unless your
[1:38:12] life copes with your testimony you
[1:38:14] haven't got it
[1:38:16] yes hey man he said because the fruit of
[1:38:20] the spirit vindicates what you are just
[1:38:22] like the fruit of any tree tells what it
[1:38:24] is Jesus said by their fruit you shall
[1:38:26] know them
[1:38:27] so now this young fellow's parents his
[1:38:29] mother is German no reflection on the
[1:38:30] German but there's a strain in that
[1:38:32] family
[1:38:33] I got a little bit of German in our
[1:38:34] family
[1:38:35] and many of you do it's common here in
[1:38:38] the U.S but it's not just Germans and
[1:38:40] again not all Germans are this way but
[1:38:42] it was strain in that family
[1:38:44] there's a strain in certain families
[1:38:47] and that shouldn't offend Us by the way
[1:38:48] it's just the way it is everybody's got
[1:38:50] something
[1:38:52] but Harvey some of us are just cheap
[1:38:57] and it's
[1:38:59] praise the lord it's just just a strain
[1:39:01] that runs in our family right
[1:39:03] and I don't think brother Harvey's
[1:39:04] offended maybe the way I said it I'm
[1:39:06] sorry for the Harvey but but you know
[1:39:08] what you know that you know that it's
[1:39:10] just you watch and you have you have
[1:39:12] more in the end because of that right
[1:39:14] some people just say wait some people
[1:39:16] like to buy like to spend money that
[1:39:18] strain runs in my family
[1:39:22] knows what I'm talking about you see
[1:39:24] that new car up at the Toyota place that
[1:39:25] new van man you want it
[1:39:27] you want it and so you you find a way to
[1:39:31] get it and some of us like to spend
[1:39:32] money and it's a strain again we
[1:39:34] shouldn't be offended by that it's just
[1:39:35] the way it is but we have to watch that
[1:39:37] make sure it doesn't contradict the word
[1:39:39] because when it does we want Christ to
[1:39:41] correct that in our lives we want the
[1:39:43] word to correct that
[1:39:45] now
[1:39:47] brother runs through the restraint on
[1:39:48] that family now if you you all know the
[1:39:50] story I've talked to you about it before
[1:39:51] this is Brother Brandon's brother and
[1:39:53] sister-in-law he doesn't say that
[1:39:54] publicly because they still went to his
[1:39:56] church
[1:39:57] the boy would be his his nephew
[1:40:01] and you kind of see it when he explains
[1:40:03] it he said that is they'll just sit and
[1:40:05] you can talk to them and they'll just
[1:40:07] stare you right in the face
[1:40:09] he's talking now about his mother's
[1:40:11] family
[1:40:12] he said this girl's sister the mother of
[1:40:13] this boy her sister I've come down the
[1:40:15] street many morning this young lady be
[1:40:17] sitting on the yard and I say good
[1:40:18] morning to you and she just look at me
[1:40:20] we run into a strain of that in Egypt
[1:40:23] not among the Believers because some of
[1:40:25] them at least have been converted
[1:40:27] but the people there and some of you
[1:40:30] have been in those Arab countries know
[1:40:31] what I'm talking about they just look at
[1:40:33] you yeah
[1:40:34] yeah they can't they don't let if they
[1:40:36] understand English and many of them do
[1:40:37] they don't want nothing to do with you
[1:40:39] and in some parts of the world are like
[1:40:41] that it's just a strain and so he'd say
[1:40:43] she'd just look at me and and I'd stop
[1:40:45] and I'd say sure a fine morning she'd
[1:40:47] just stand look right at you an
[1:40:48] intelligent woman he said I'd say come
[1:40:50] up see us sometime she just stand and
[1:40:52] look well her brothers are that way
[1:40:54] father and mothers that way he said now
[1:40:57] the father of the boy is strictly an
[1:40:58] Irishman this is Brother Brandon's side
[1:41:00] of the family Moody and high temperate
[1:41:02] High Strung he said that's his whole
[1:41:04] family like that except one other out of
[1:41:05] the family converted
[1:41:07] yeah
[1:41:09] he said this father and mother both are
[1:41:11] Christians filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:41:13] and they have brought this young man up
[1:41:15] in the way of the Lord
[1:41:17] and now the young man is about 17 or 18
[1:41:19] years old something along their very
[1:41:21] fine kid he's been a real model boy at
[1:41:23] home nice kid he's got a brother that's
[1:41:25] just vice versa but the girls the
[1:41:28] mother's family lives close to a fine
[1:41:30] Church
[1:41:31] and we've seen this heavenly he said but
[1:41:33] do you think they'd ever come over there
[1:41:35] no
[1:41:37] they know it's right he said but when he
[1:41:40] says close to the he's about to say
[1:41:42] close to the Tabernacle he said they
[1:41:44] know it's right but it's just not in
[1:41:45] them to ask forgiveness or ask pardoning
[1:41:47] they just won't do it
[1:41:50] just not in them
[1:41:53] he said now the jeans and the father and
[1:41:54] the mother at this point no matter how
[1:41:55] much they are converted Still Remains
[1:41:57] the flesh that's been integrated out to
[1:41:58] this boy
[1:42:00] therefore the boy's got a complex in him
[1:42:01] just like from his mother's family
[1:42:03] they're not forgiving they will not
[1:42:04] apologize and that's where that boy
[1:42:06] stands
[1:42:09] now watch
[1:42:10] he said he should never get married
[1:42:12] until he has the Holy Spirit
[1:42:14] because he would never communicate with
[1:42:16] a wife in a way that will allow them to
[1:42:18] have a Christian home he might never hit
[1:42:20] her he might be a good provider
[1:42:23] but he will never say I'm sorry
[1:42:26] he can't make that sacrifice it pleases
[1:42:28] God
[1:42:30] oh God
[1:42:32] he'll never say I forgive you I find
[1:42:35] many times the problem among men and
[1:42:37] this is not always the case but many
[1:42:39] times among men the problem is saying
[1:42:41] I'm sorry
[1:42:43] and among women it's saying I forgive
[1:42:45] you
[1:42:47] I forgive you it's hard isn't it
[1:42:49] it's hard to forgive it's easy to
[1:42:51] forgive when the wrong that's done to
[1:42:52] you is something Petty
[1:42:54] right it's harder to forgive when it's
[1:42:57] real
[1:43:01] yeah when it's like Corey ten Boom who
[1:43:03] stood there and watched this they those
[1:43:05] German guards killed her sister
[1:43:08] hard to forgive
[1:43:10] yeah it's hard to forgive someone who
[1:43:12] did something terribly vile to you or to
[1:43:15] your family it's hard to forgive but
[1:43:16] Jesus didn't leave us any outs he said
[1:43:18] when you stand praying forgive and if
[1:43:20] you don't forgive you won't be forgiven
[1:43:25] it's easy to say
[1:43:27] I forgive you when it's simple
[1:43:30] what if it's not
[1:43:32] but that's the problem many times you
[1:43:34] can't say I'm sorry you can't say I
[1:43:35] forgive you so you can't have a
[1:43:36] Christian home
[1:43:38] the way it ought to be
[1:43:40] because you can't do it
[1:43:42] you need the Holy Spirit
[1:43:45] I said to the father no matter how much
[1:43:46] you've raised him up I said now look at
[1:43:47] you out of your family all them drunks
[1:43:49] and fighting and shooting and cutting
[1:43:51] so forth
[1:43:52] I said now look at your family to the
[1:43:54] mother there are a bunch of people just
[1:43:55] sit there won't speak very independent
[1:43:57] irreverent to religion I said it's not
[1:44:00] you you're the only one of all your
[1:44:02] sisters and brothers you're sweet kind
[1:44:03] and forgiving so the parents had the
[1:44:05] Holy Spirit
[1:44:07] he said what does that your tree part of
[1:44:09] that family tree yet you've received the
[1:44:11] Holy Ghost he said that's the thing that
[1:44:12] made you tender and sweet it's not your
[1:44:15] people anymore it's your Christ that
[1:44:17] lives in you I said let me that be my
[1:44:19] testimony today it's not my people
[1:44:22] anymore it's not the Prudence or or the
[1:44:25] taxes it's not my people but it's Christ
[1:44:27] yeah
[1:44:30] yeah forgive me Mama tell a story on our
[1:44:32] family we were mom was telling me some
[1:44:33] stories and and she wrote a letter to
[1:44:36] one time to find her grandfather because
[1:44:37] she I guess she'd never met him she's 16
[1:44:39] years old she wrote a letter to the
[1:44:41] Texas state highway patrol to find him
[1:44:43] and they wrote back and said if you do
[1:44:45] find him let us know
[1:44:49] I thought he was a cattle wrestler
[1:44:53] but I'm not my people anymore
[1:44:56] how many can say Amen to that this
[1:44:58] morning I'm not my people anymore I
[1:45:00] belong to God I'm a part of his family
[1:45:02] tree my family tree has Abraham in it
[1:45:05] who believes God it was imputed to him
[1:45:07] for righteousness my family tree has
[1:45:09] David in it who send me yet he was a man
[1:45:11] after God so hard and he repented
[1:45:13] quickly my family tree has Jesus in it
[1:45:16] amen
[1:45:18] this child I belong to him you love him
[1:45:20] today do you believe that today my
[1:45:23] family tree is the acts of the of the
[1:45:25] Apostles amen where they did signs and
[1:45:27] wonders and miracles that's where I
[1:45:29] belong that's my family tree I'm not my
[1:45:31] people anymore
[1:45:33] it's Christ that lives in you
[1:45:36] amen
[1:45:38] I said to the boy look at your family
[1:45:40] practically all them drunks and so forth
[1:45:42] said how moody and high temper and high
[1:45:44] stroma
[1:45:45] but you're not
[1:45:46] you're kind forgiving
[1:45:49] God help us today
[1:45:53] my grandpa had a son
[1:45:55] they didn't care if he existed and my
[1:45:57] grandpa was a good man
[1:45:58] we had that strain in his family my
[1:46:00] grandpa and my dad's side I had a son
[1:46:01] who didn't care if he existed
[1:46:04] didn't care and the son ended up
[1:46:06] becoming becoming living a homosexual
[1:46:09] lifestyle and leaving his dad wouldn't
[1:46:11] bail him out of jail when he's young I
[1:46:12] don't say whether it's right or wrong
[1:46:13] but he just wouldn't have nothing more
[1:46:14] to do with him and he got in a little
[1:46:16] trouble it caused all kinds of problems
[1:46:18] in his life but I'm not my people
[1:46:20] anymore
[1:46:22] I'm being open and honest with you today
[1:46:25] because I want you to think about your
[1:46:26] own life your own family not my people
[1:46:28] anymore
[1:46:33] he said you know more what you are
[1:46:35] he said I said now that same thing has
[1:46:37] to happen to your son
[1:46:39] the father raised up and said my son
[1:46:40] went to the altar he was baptized
[1:46:43] correctly in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:46:44] water baptism in the pool said I know my
[1:46:47] son has come to Christ I said that may
[1:46:49] be all right all the outward motions he
[1:46:51] might be identified as a Believer with
[1:46:53] the Believers but until he has
[1:46:55] regenerated born again I'd advise that
[1:46:57] young man to never marry a woman
[1:46:59] he'll make hell on Earth for her until
[1:47:02] that gentle sweet forgiving Spirit of
[1:47:04] Christ comes in then that will be a
[1:47:06] paradox in itself to take the very
[1:47:08] nature of a boy that's spread between
[1:47:10] father and mother
[1:47:13] yet in his intellectuals he's trying his
[1:47:15] best to overcome it but he can't do it
[1:47:18] he'll never overcome it Christ will have
[1:47:20] to overcome it when he lets Christ in
[1:47:22] then he's already overcome then it'll be
[1:47:25] a perfect Paradox when a man is born of
[1:47:27] the spirit of God
[1:47:29] Hallelujah he said I've seen critics
[1:47:32] stand off and make fun and carry on of a
[1:47:34] holy ghost Revival and after a while god
[1:47:36] get a hold of that same man and change
[1:47:37] him and here he stands right in the
[1:47:39] Pulpit preaching the same thing he once
[1:47:41] hated it's a paradox now that God can
[1:47:43] take the unbeliever make a Believer out
[1:47:45] of him he said I wonder if a man thinks
[1:47:47] that Miracles is passed I wonder what
[1:47:49] kind of a scientific medicine you could
[1:47:51] give such a person to change that
[1:47:52] disposition in them listen they don't
[1:47:54] need scientific medicine they need the
[1:47:56] Holy Ghost
[1:47:58] right
[1:47:59] take that he said take that hatred in
[1:48:01] Malice and strife out
[1:48:03] there's no one can explain it but it's a
[1:48:04] paradox because it's a miracle of God
[1:48:06] when a man has changed from the person
[1:48:08] that he is to a new creature in Christ
[1:48:10] Jesus he becomes a new creation he is no
[1:48:13] more what he used to be he is absolutely
[1:48:16] a new creation in Christ let me be that
[1:48:19] new creation let me be that new creation
[1:48:22] like Adam was when Adam and Eve come
[1:48:24] together and he said she is Flesh of My
[1:48:26] Flesh bone of my bones
[1:48:28] who else will I communicate with I'll
[1:48:31] communicate with her or aren't you glad
[1:48:33] God's that way the Bible says if any man
[1:48:36] be in Christ he's a new creature old
[1:48:38] things are passed away all things are
[1:48:40] passed away behold all things have
[1:48:42] become new all things have become new is
[1:48:45] that your testimony today old things are
[1:48:47] passed away behold all things
[1:48:50] someone say old things this morning all
[1:48:52] things have become new you have that
[1:48:54] testimony today all things have become
[1:48:57] new
[1:49:00] honey we need to talk
[1:49:05] find yourself you can't communicate
[1:49:08] your marriage will suffer
[1:49:11] you can't continue like that and I'll
[1:49:12] think spiritually for a moment
[1:49:14] what if you can't communicate with your
[1:49:16] lord
[1:49:19] what have you never talked to
[1:49:22] your communication only goes to the
[1:49:23] pastor he don't want it just to be
[1:49:25] through a third party
[1:49:28] there is one mediator between God and
[1:49:30] man the man Christ Jesus
[1:49:34] you don't want it just to be through
[1:49:36] your pastor
[1:49:37] you don't want it just to be through
[1:49:39] well I listen to tapes sometimes all
[1:49:41] right you need to talk to him yes
[1:49:44] you need to hear from him yes

[1:49:55] he had to come down in a form that they
[1:49:57] didn't understand
[1:49:59] and they didn't know
[1:50:01] he said why are you so sad you see the
[1:50:04] husbands
[1:50:06] dad's

[1:51:16] standing in the garden with fig leaves
[1:51:18] on

[1:51:21] his children yeah yeah and begins to
[1:51:24] call Adam
[1:51:25] Adam where are you
[1:51:27] he didn't wait on Adam to come looking
[1:51:29] for him

[1:52:07] and be a Christian marriage and that's
[1:52:08] what we want why why settle for less
[1:52:13] we can have the best
[1:52:16] we can have the best in the church we
[1:52:19] don't have to be like the Baptist or the
[1:52:20] Methodist they can have good things in
[1:52:22] their church that's wonderful but we can
[1:52:24] be the best
[1:52:25] why not do it
[1:52:27] this message just isn't long hair and
[1:52:29] long dresses and
[1:52:31] a husband who hunts and fishes
[1:52:33] that's not what this message is
[1:52:36] this message is communion yeah
[1:52:38] yeah communication God said I want to
[1:52:40] talk to you
[1:52:41] I want my bride to know what I'm
[1:52:43] thinking
[1:52:46] want you to Bow your heads with me

[1:53:07] of it
[1:53:09] I'll take care of it
[1:53:11] you hold you you stay with that promise
[1:53:14] because you really can't be right with
[1:53:16] God until you write with your brother
[1:53:17] your sister
[1:53:18] your spouse
[1:53:21] maybe the communication is broken down
[1:53:23] between you and God
[1:53:25] that's happened to me before huh we're
[1:53:27] human beings we're two-thirds unsaved
[1:53:29] and yet that Soul dominates Our Lives if
[1:53:32] you feel with the Holy Spirit
[1:53:34] but you think about it you have a body
[1:53:36] and a spirit
[1:53:37] there's still just the same old genes
[1:53:40] same old things
[1:53:43] why don't you talk to God just a moment
[1:53:44] Lord
[1:53:46] I want to communicate with you today

[1:53:53] primary source of my strength
[1:53:57] I want you to I want I want to talk to
[1:53:59] you
[1:54:00] I want to be in such close communion
[1:54:02] that when your body has some need that

[1:55:08] I want to be like the ones on the road
[1:55:09] to Emmaus as you begin to talk they
[1:55:12] begin to talk and finally they saw you

[1:55:16] your death and they knew it was you
