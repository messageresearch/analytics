Well, it seems like everybody's talking about heaven. And if you want to go along, you better be believing. I've got a feeling someday soon we'll be leaving.

A hopeless case an empty place. If not for grace, where would I be? You will know. I'm glad you see Lord through eyes of love. I'm a hopeless case and empty place. Thank God for grace. Oh precious Lord, take my hand. Oh, lead me on and let me stand. I'm a hopeless place, an empty place. Thank God for grace. Amazing grace. How sweet the sound that saved a rich like me. I once was lost but now I'm found. was blind, but now I see. My chains are gone. I've been set free. My God, my Savior has ransomed me. And like a flood his mercy reigns. Unending love. It's amazing grace. Where would I be? You only know. I'm glad you see me through eyes of love. I'm a hopeless case, an empty place if not for grace. I'm a hopeless case and empty place. Thank God for grace. Thank you all. &gt;&gt; Let's sing that again as we invite our pastor to come. Where would I be? You only know. I'm glad you see through eyes of love. If not for grace singing now, where would I be? Oh yes, you only know. Oh, you only see through eyes of love. I was a hopeless cave, an empty place, if not grace. Aren't you glad for grace tonight? Amazing grace, how sweet the sound. When you find, if you make it over there, I believe that you will. You find me find me singing, "Amazing grace, how sweet the sound." What brother Brandham said, "Amazing grace." How sweet the sound. Paul says, "By the grace of God, I am what I am." Aren't you glad for his grace today? You're glad for his mercy. Amen. My goodness. I believe his spirit is here tonight. And I'm going to introduce brother Josh Kathy. Brother Josh, she just moved here and part of the church here with us now, part of our ministry team. And I just I just appreciate them having the confidence to come and I believe it's going they're going to be a big part of what we do here at the church. But brother Josh has got an amazing testimony. I believe he's going to share some of that with us today. And and um you know God has a way of getting you. He's got a way of doing what he does. And I I believe that I believe that there's hope for everyone. And we just love him for that. Thank him for what he's done for us. As brother Josh comes, let's just sing it one more time. Oh, I I was a hopeless case, church. An empty place without form and void, but God rich in mercy. Hallelujah. He found me. Aren't you glad for that? As brother Josh comes, you only know. I'm glad you see how to rise to love. I was a hopeless case. Thank you, Lord. An empty place if not for grace. Amazing grace. Amazing grace. How sweet the sound of glory. Oh, but now I found I was a whole space and empty. If not for grace, where would I be? You only know where would I be. Oh yeah. God bless your the house or should I say mostly because when I put something somewhere it gets moved somewhere else just kind but brother Vinnie had asked me to speak this evening and um I'd preached here a few other times maybe a handful of times but thought it would just be a good &gt;&gt; opportunity to share my testimony. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To share how that how the light got lit. Brother Brandham said, "If you can't do anything else, just tell somebody how your light got lit." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so I believe I believe that and I believe this message with all my heart. I believe this Bible with all my heart. And I it's my absolute. &gt;&gt; And let's if we could let's turn to um Proverbs 13:15. And I didn't um I didn't grow up a Christian. I grew up in this area as many of you might know. Um but I didn't quite grow up a Christian going to church, anything like that. Didn't didn't know much about the message. Um so I have kind of a history in this area that I'm not exactly proud of, but I believe it's a part of our testimonies. I believe those those things are, you know, they're not ordained of God to happen in our lives. And we get that permissive will sometimes, but I believe it can all be put together in our testimonies as a as an evidence as a as something that we can be not well not proud of, but we can say this is where God came in my life and this is who I was and this is who I am now. &gt;&gt; And Proverbs 13:15, it says, "Good understanding giveth favor, but the way of transgressors is hard." &gt;&gt; Yeah. And that'd be the title tonight, the way of a transgressor, which just will be my testimony, but I thought that was a I thought about that scripture and how brother Brandon had mentioned it many times and it felt like it just fit my life. Um, we could just bow our heads for a moment. Heavenly Father, Lord, we just thank you for another opportunity to come into your house, Lord, to worship your name. And Lord, we just ask that you would be with us in this service, Lord. that you would anoint ears to hear, Lord. That we could just be a help to somebody, Father. That's all we want to be. It's not we're not standing up here for a show. We're not here to here to please anybody else but you, Father. We just want to help one another. And Lord, I believe a testimony that can happen. I believe when you hear what someone's been through, maybe somebody else is going through it, Father. And you know these things. We don't know everything, but we just ask that you would take full control of the service and that you would just have your way in it. In Jesus Christ's name we ask. Amen. Amen. You may be seated. This Proverbs and I'm just going to try and talk as I didn't really want to try and preach a sermon tonight. Um, I just wanted to talk as open and as candid as I could about my testimony. I didn't want to get up here and preach to everybody. and you know, but not exactly, but I just wanted to be open about my life. And if I'm going to be a part of you here and I came up here and I have a history here, I would want the church, if I'm going to be a minister in this church, to know about that firsthand, not not hear it from anybody else, not hear it from because I have to say the other night, brother Ben and brother Joel, they had came over to my house that we moved into and um we were sitting there fellowship in the living room and and they were they were kind of poking fun at me, but they were saying, "We've heard a few things about you in this area. we we've heard a few things. And I said, "Well, what did you hear?" And I I don't really want to share exactly what they heard, matter of fact. But it it um it made me it made me real I had never realized how um ashamed I was of who I had been. &gt;&gt; Okay. But I never realized how ashamed I was of who I had been. And when when they told me that that night, I had trouble sleeping. I couldn't go to sleep. I thought about it all night. And I was thinking, there just two people in the church. There's a whole church of people here that can talk to anybody and everybody they want to. And so it it it just kind of um I was ashamed about it. But the Lord, he as I prayed, he laid some scriptures on my heart and some some thoughts in the scripture and he he kind of comforted me. He let me know that it wasn't for it wasn't without a purpose because that's exactly as brother Ben preached this morning. And if I get emotional talking about it, &gt;&gt; I apologize. But &gt;&gt; good. &gt;&gt; But when he preached this morning, the earth was without form and void. And I would say that's exactly who I was. &gt;&gt; I didn't know my maker. I didn't know I didn't know who I was, &gt;&gt; plainly put. And the enemy, he wants to keep you on that ground. He wants to keep you not knowing who you are. He wants to keep you as far away from Jesus Christ as he can keep you. He doesn't want you to know &gt;&gt; what what's out there per se. &gt;&gt; And something that uh something that had came to my mind, the scripture, the the first one that had came to mind when I was thinking about giving my testimony was it was actually just a few Bible characters or or people in the scripture. It was Mori and Hmon. &gt;&gt; And how and how Hmon when Mordei wouldn't bow to him, how how he was just after Mordei all the time. He he just wanted what was the scripture doesn't I'm sure tell us that whole story. I'm sure the day-to-day living for Mori was not comfortable &gt;&gt; because he he refused to bow but at that at the and God has a way of doing things. &gt;&gt; He has a way of when the enemy's had his hand on you for so long he has a way of turning it back around on him. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so we get to a point in that story to where Hmon has to be the one I believe it goes that he had to he had to dress Mori &gt;&gt; and he had to will him around through the city. And then you get later on in the story and this would be my testimony right here. You get later on in that story and the the thing that happened was that Hmon had these gallows built &gt;&gt; and his his main thing that he wanted for these gallows right here &gt;&gt; was to hang Morai on them. And then at the end of that story, he flips the script. And God has a way of coming into our lives, coming on the scene, and flipping the script in our life. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And what he did there was Hmon ended up hanging on the exact gallows that he had built to kill Morai. &gt;&gt; And that's exactly what a testimony is. &gt;&gt; Come on. That's right. It's you getting up and telling about those gallows that that had your name on them &gt;&gt; that were meant for you, &gt;&gt; but now &gt;&gt; they're meant for the enemy. &gt;&gt; That's what a testimony is. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; And I apologize for getting emotional. It's &gt;&gt; But I believe God respects that. You know, it shows &gt;&gt; when you get it's not there's nothing wrong with crying about your testimony or crying about what he's done for you. &gt;&gt; It's showing how important it was to you. &gt;&gt; And and that's exactly we we talk about revival a lot in the church. If we want revival, then get alone between you and God and think back to what he did for you. &gt;&gt; Let your mind really go back to everything he's done for you. &gt;&gt; We We talk about power and knowing who we are and all these things. That's all great and I believe it and I believe that was preached. &gt;&gt; Come on. But get alone with God sometimes and think exactly what all you've been through &gt;&gt; because the enemy, you know, the me our memory will betray us so much of the time. That channel of memory, it'll betray you. It'll bring these things from the past rushing in. You did this, you did that. He'll try and bury you under a pile of guilt &gt;&gt; is exactly what he'll do. &gt;&gt; But that channel of memory can also bring to to remembrance all that God has brought you through. I may have been this before, but I'm this now. &gt;&gt; I'm not that anymore. &gt;&gt; I'm not him anymore. &gt;&gt; Because the prophet tells us that's exactly what the enemy wants to do. He wants to get you to doubt your position. And to get you to doubt your position, he's going to bring anything and everything he can against you. Like a court case, &gt;&gt; he's going to pull up all this so-called evidence that he has that I guess he I think he does realize it's under the blood, but he's still going to bring it up. He's going to try and bring it before the believer &gt;&gt; and say, "There's no way this person right here, &gt;&gt; cuz you know who you was. There's no way this person right here was redeemable. &gt;&gt; Think about this. Think about when you did this. You did this. Do you think the other people sitting in the church have done that? &gt;&gt; He'll ask you questions like that. &gt;&gt; Do you think they've ever struggled with that? Brother so and so, they've lived it their whole life. &gt;&gt; They never had a slip up. But see, that's that's that's presuming that's virtual without authority. We don't know anybody else's life. We've all been through stuff. We all have a testimony. We all have a journey. And it's not always a proudest thing. The definition of testimony in itself, I may not be very I may not go very long tonight. It's a testimony. I might have to go 4 hours if I want. So, I might do that or I might go 30 minutes. I don't know. They preach on this wire. I'm not I should keep going. You know, I'm just I'm just But the definition of testimony according to Webster is a firstand authentification of a fact or one in better terms, an evidence. And that's exactly what my testimony is to me. It's an evidence. It's an evidence that something happened. It's an evidence that God works today. It's an evidence that that the law still works. that you can still claim the blood of Jesus Christ and you can be saved from sin. That's what my testimony is. And your testimony never stops. It wasn't just from the point where when you didn't know the Lord till when you knew him. But I'd like to think that my testimony goes on every single day I live. Every step I take, I wanted to add to that testimony. &gt;&gt; I don't just want to say the Lord save me if I haven't felt his presence again. No. I want say he's walked with me every day since that day and he's never left me and he's never forsook me. He's never let the enemy have me but he's walked with me. He's held me when I couldn't stand up. He's a footprint in the sand. When I couldn't walk, he walked for me. But these testimonies are very I I believe we should have more testimony services. I believe they're important. I believe they're encouraging the prophecy. He was speaking in a message here at the wall apart and in the world fall apart. I think a week before that there had been a lot of testimony services and like he listened to these men tell their testimonies and this is what he had to say. But he said, "Sir, my privilege to be here to be these five testimonies from the brothers that's in love with our Lord Jesus." He said, "Now I still obey all that." He said, "Lord, I say the inspiration I received from your messages." He received the the prophet God received inspiration from these men's testimonies. You think just a little testimony or some deep theological sermon. It it wasn't something groundbreaking. It wasn't something on the seal some on whatever it may be. But when he received inspiration, what he received inspiration from was sincere hearts crying out, was sincere hearts telling a story about what they had been through. That's what he receive inspiration from. And that that's what God looks for so much of the time is a sincere heart that he can work with. That that's the point I believe that I had to get to. And my testimony is when I grew up not going to a whole lot of church. I've never been to church 10 times in my whole life. I would say if I was missing up to the point where I where I heard the message and came back to church and as I was growing up, excuse me, as I was growing up, I didn't go to church and my my story is I I got to a point in my life where I was trying to work. I realized there was a vault and there was invitation to go to Wyoming and continue playing. and I go up to Wyoming and I get to collegiate baseball league there. And as I'm playing, you know, I'm I told this at the church in Arizona before I left, I talked about the power transformation. And again, I think you heard some quotes from it this morning. I told them, "I am a believer in the power of transformation." Because anybody that tells me that God still can't transform, I would have a problem with that because I believe I'm I'm a standing testimony of that that God still has that power to transform somebody in their lives. And when he was God started working on me when I was up there and well, I believe it was as he was done chasing me. I shared with somebody the other day, my whole life, everywhere I went, I worked I was surrounded by the message somehow. I worked there and all my life there and I admire my grandma my whole life picture in her home and I never asked any questions. I guess what I thought that was cuz I knew brother Paul was a big fan. I realized that about him and I went in his home one time. I saw the same color fire picture there that was in my grandma's house. And I remember thinking, well, this must just be an old church home. They must all have that picture. I didn't know anything about Baptist or Methodist or Presbyterian or Catholics or anything like that. When I saw the picture, in my mind that this represented somebody that was a pretty good person that they went to church with. That's what I thought it was in my mind at that point. But so I was in this collegiate wing in Wyoming and and God I believe can get to a point where he was done chasing and then he'll get to that point sometimes. Sometimes you'll only be left with two doors in your life that you can walk through that you can accept it or you can deny it. And he got tired of chasing me and I got to a point in in um in Wyoming there that that I kind of just had to come apart my my mind thought I was going crazy, you know. I lost lost my mind is what I would say. I remember being at a if we got time, I'm going to get open and get vulnerable with you for a minute, but I remember being at a gas station and we were pulled in the gas station and all and we were all in a single cab truck about four of us and I was driving and they ran in and I as a pack of cigarettes said, "Hey, will you guys give me some cigarettes out of there?" And I I was sitting in that truck and right when I said that a a physical feeling came over me of fear and dread and anxiety and and it rushed in my body and I didn't know anyone else in the truck. I got out the truck and I was standing there for and I had no idea what was happening to me and I I I I lost um I lost my consciousness of myself and the next thing I know I'm standing in a room. I'm standing on the road. There's cars moving. goes down and I found myself standing right there in the room and I remember I went back to the truck and I called my mom and I didn't know what was going on and I tried to describe it what I was feeling and I I did the best I could to talk about it and I didn't know what it was and that we were staying with I was staying at the coach's home of the team and we went back to the house and I tried to sleep and I've been sleeping all night and this this anxiety My name is hanging over the top of me and I kept calling my mom and this is 15 hours from Dber Tennessee where they were living and sto and we just decided the best thing to happen was come home make it to Dber that's a 15-hour drive and so I don't feel this way now I can't describe the feeling to you if anybody's ever felt anxiety anxiety is fear driven and what anxiety is is you're you're scared something that you don't even know what you're scared of. It's it's irrelevant. It's it's it doesn't make any sense type of fear. It's just a dread and a nervousness that comes over you for anxiety. And I've been told by all the folks that they used to not, you hear anxiety, all this problems with anxiety and things like that. But what anxiety is to me is a is a scare tactic of the enemy. It's something that he places on somebody. But I believe I got to a point where the Lord took a step back and took a I believe he kept me and protected me before I ever accepted him. I believe he kept his eye on me because he knew where he's the alpha. He knew where I was going to end up at. And I believe he kept me. I remember there were times when my friends would be doing things that I thought was a little bit too far. And he would keep me in certain moments like that. There's times where I believe that I was supposed to be dead. I flip here. I don't know what it's called, but the the road on Pocahontas in between where Pocahontas is. And when you get off the road taking in between there, I rolled a truck, a truck with 37in tires, big tall truck, and I rolled. There was a culprit like this and one did a little water and I hit that with my truck and went over it and landed on the other side. You can't explain things like that. You can't explain why you were kept, but he kept me. He He kept us when we were unreliable, when it seemed, when we were unlovable people. that she was
