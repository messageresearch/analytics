[11:09] also today, just before we before I do
[11:12] anything else, I I don't want to forget
[11:13] a special anniversary. Brother Caleb and
[11:15] sister Sophie just celebrated an
[11:17] anniversary today. Today? Well, go ahead
[11:21] and give him a nice big I think it's 14
[11:24] years. 14 years, man. Brother Caleb
[11:27] don't even look old
[11:31] enough. It's good. Glad to glad to have
[11:34] him in church on their they tried to
[11:36] they had an anniversary getaway right in
[11:37] the middle of the flood and uh we had to
[11:41] tell them what
[11:42] happened.
[11:43] Amen. Good to have every one of you here
[11:46] tonight. Are you ready for the word of
[11:47] the Lord? Amen. Y'all are just singing
[11:48] so good. And Amen. Brother Josh, you
[11:50] know, he's no stranger to us. Josh
[11:53] Kathy, he's from there in Tucson,
[11:54] Arizona. He's actually an ary, but uh he
[11:57] resides in Tucson. He's a transplant out
[11:59] there. And so just uh we want to just
[12:02] pull on the gift of God tonight, don't
[12:03] we? Do you believe if you come with
[12:05] expectations that you're going to get
[12:07] what you expect? And I believe tonight
[12:09] if you need if you have a need on your
[12:11] heart, if you just hold that in your
[12:13] heart tonight, I believe God can walk
[12:15] right down these aisles and meet your
[12:17] need in this meeting tonight. You say,
[12:19] "Well, well, the Lord don't know. He
[12:21] knows everything about you." The one
[12:23] that stood there and discerned the
[12:24] hearts of the people. I mean, he's still
[12:26] here. And so, let's just go ahead and
[12:28] pull on the gift of God tonight. And my
[12:30] brother Josh is a young man, not been
[12:31] preaching a long time, but every time
[12:32] he's come, he's blessed us. And I say
[12:34] tonight, let's just get behind the man
[12:36] of God. Amen. He's got the ball tonight.
[12:38] So let's just be the team around him and
[12:40] just and just pull on him. Can we do
[12:41] that tonight? Amen. Before he comes,
[12:44] let's just sing that song. They that
[12:45] wait upon the Lord, key of
[12:49] F. They that
[12:51] wait upon the
[12:54] Lord shall
[12:57] renew their strength.
[13:00] They shall mount
[13:03] us with
[13:05] wings as an
[13:10] eagle. They shall run and not be
[13:16] weary. They shall walk and not
[13:21] faint. Teach me Lord.
[13:25] Teach me,
[13:27] Lord, how a way. Can you sing it one
[13:31] more time? Oh, they that
[13:35] way upon the
[13:38] Lord shall
[13:40] renew their
[13:43] strength. They shall mount up.
[13:50] [Music]
[13:55] They
[13:56] [Music]
[14:02] shall and
[14:05] nothing. Teach me,
[14:08] Lord. Teach me,
[14:13] Lord. Amen. God bless you tonight. It's
[14:16] good to be here with you. Good to see
[14:19] everybody again. Greetings from Shalom
[14:20] Tabernacle. Brother Israel's in Tucson,
[14:23] Arizona. And just want to thank brother
[14:25] Ben for another opportunity to come and
[14:27] speak to you. I've had a every time I've
[14:29] done it, I've had a great time. It's
[14:31] been great people to speak to. So easy
[14:33] to preach to
[14:37] people. I guess I just need to talk
[14:39] louder. Just need to talk a little bit
[14:41] louder. I ain't I ain't like Joel. I
[14:43] ain't allowed talker sometimes. I'd
[14:46] actually like to buy by by raise of
[14:47] hands. Who does like me more than Joel?
[14:49] I'm just kidding. Don't Don't raise your
[14:50] hand. Don't raise your hand. It'll hurt
[14:52] his feelings. He'll get a complex and we
[14:54] don't need
[14:55] to. God bless you all. It's good to be
[14:57] here. Um happy to have my family with
[15:00] me. I think she's already had to go out.
[15:03] So, perfect. Um and I told Brother Ben I
[15:06] only have about Thank you, musicians,
[15:08] everybody. I told Brother Ben I only
[15:10] have about uh 4 hours worth of sermon
[15:13] tonight. And he said he said I could do
[15:15] it. He just told me to lock up and he'd
[15:17] be waiting for me down at McDonald's
[15:18] afterwards. So, that should work out
[15:20] nicely. Me and Joel, he'll just sit
[15:22] right here and he'll stay here and
[15:23] listen. But, um, if we just turn to
[15:25] Psalm 85 as we get started, verses
[15:29] 6-9. And the title this evening is God
[15:32] sent
[15:34] Revival. Psalm
[15:37] 85 verses 6-9.
[15:49] Starting at verse
[15:50] six, it says, "Wilt thou not revive us
[15:54] again that thy people may rejoice in
[15:57] thee?" And I I feel like that is a
[15:59] prayer of so many believers hearts
[16:01] today, so many churches. It's what
[16:03] they're looking for. Lord, wilt thou not
[16:05] revive us again, Lord, that thy people
[16:08] may rejoice in thee? Because we we can
[16:11] rejoice in a lot of things, but what we
[16:12] want to be rejoicing in is the Lord
[16:14] Jesus Christ. What he did at Calvary.
[16:17] That's what we want on our mind. That's
[16:18] what we want to the scripture says
[16:20] somewhere the Lord, it's a vision and he
[16:22] he says, "Put me in remembrance." You
[16:25] know, there's a lot of things that the
[16:26] enemy will try and put us in remembrance
[16:28] of. But the Lord says, "Put me in your
[16:32] remembrance. Don't remember your past
[16:34] mistakes. Don't don't remember all these
[16:36] all the afflictions, everything else.
[16:38] all all the when when you've been tied
[16:40] down, but put me in your remembrance.
[16:42] Goes on, it says, "Show us thy mercy, O
[16:44] Lord, and grant us thy salvation. I will
[16:47] hear what God the Lord will speak, for
[16:49] he will speak peace unto his people and
[16:51] to his saints." He says, "But let them
[16:54] not turn again to folly." Let's just bow
[16:57] our heads. Heavenly Father, Lord, we
[16:59] just thank you for another opportunity.
[17:01] Lord, we we thank you for another chance
[17:03] to praise the holy name of Jesus.
[17:05] Father, we thank you for what you did at
[17:07] Calvary. Lord,
[17:08] we we just want to say thank you in
[17:11] general. Lord, put us in remembrance of
[17:13] you. Put us in remembrance of what
[17:14] you've done for us, what you're
[17:16] currently doing for us, and Lord, what's
[17:18] coming, what you're going to do for us.
[17:20] And Father, we just ask you would walk
[17:21] the aisles tonight, Lord, that you would
[17:23] be with each heart, Lord, if somebody
[17:24] needs a touch, Father, that you would be
[17:26] there to just lay your hand upon them.
[17:28] And we ask these things in Jesus
[17:29] Christ's name. Amen. Amen. You may be
[17:32] seated.
[17:34] The scripture here reads, it says, "But
[17:36] let them not turn again to folly." And
[17:39] the definition, that word folly is an
[17:41] excessively costly or unprofitable
[17:45] undertaking. That's a definition of
[17:47] folly. And Israel had plenty of that.
[17:49] You know, we always like to talk about
[17:50] Israel and pick on Israel, how they, you
[17:53] know, they they made mistakes. They
[17:54] veered wrong many, many times. And and
[17:57] right here, he's praying about revival.
[18:00] And then at the very end of it, he says,
[18:01] "But don't let them turn to that folly."
[18:03] And what Israel's folly, what it cost
[18:05] them was their freedom. Many times, time
[18:08] and time again, it the the price they
[18:10] had to pay for breaking God's
[18:12] commandments, his statutes, his
[18:14] judgments.
[18:16] It was their freedom. That was that's
[18:18] what it cost Israel. And that's what it
[18:20] cost us today. Sometimes it cost us our
[18:22] freedom. We like to shackle oursel back
[18:24] again. We before we know it, we've
[18:26] already slapped the shackles back on and
[18:28] and we're we're just we're going with
[18:30] whatever the enemy wants us to go in our
[18:32] lives. Come on. But they wanted to be
[18:35] revived back to how it had been before.
[18:37] David said in another place, Psalm 51, I
[18:39] believe he said, "Restore unto me the
[18:41] joy of my salvation." Something we know
[18:45] by the prophet's teaching that that's
[18:46] something David already had in him. He
[18:49] already had that joy in him. He wanted
[18:51] to be restored back to that joy. He
[18:53] wanted it to be new to him again. Just
[18:55] like when the when the mercy of God
[18:57] first fell on you and me. That's what
[19:00] real revival in the heart is right
[19:01] there. You know, we we can run the
[19:03] aisles. We can get happy and we we can
[19:05] jump up and down. We can we can shout.
[19:07] We can scream. And those things are
[19:09] good. Those things are part of a
[19:11] service. That's part of God's spirit
[19:13] falling on people. But real revival is
[19:15] when you take it through those doors and
[19:17] you take it out into the world. That's
[19:20] what revival is. That's how revival
[19:21] fires used to spread. That's how it used
[19:24] to happen. And that's what revival is
[19:27] when you when you get and it it's an
[19:29] individual thing. And we know that it's
[19:31] it's not a group thing anymore. That
[19:33] veil has been rent. We we can talk
[19:35] directly to God. We we can have a
[19:38] oneon-one with Jesus Christ at any
[19:40] moment of the day whenever we want it.
[19:42] That veil was torn for that purpose. But
[19:44] when we neglect something like that in
[19:46] our lives, you start sewing that veil
[19:48] back together.
[19:50] Yeah. Do you want to sew it up to where
[19:52] we got to go back to to being under a
[19:54] law? He said that was Israel's in a
[19:56] quote. The prophet said that was
[19:57] Israel's biggest mistake was when they
[20:00] chose law over grace
[20:03] for me. I want the grace covenant. I
[20:05] don't want the law. I don't want to be
[20:07] shackled anymore. I don't want to be
[20:08] held down anymore. But I want grace to
[20:10] abide over my life. I want to be put in
[20:13] remembrance of what it was like when he
[20:15] freshly fell upon me the first time when
[20:18] he struck my heart. That's revival.
[20:21] That's the revival that needs to strike
[20:23] each and every every church, each and
[20:25] every person in a church. That's what
[20:28] we're looking for. Let's turn over to 2
[20:30] Chronicles chapter 7.
[20:33] We'll start at verse one
[20:38] here now. Now, so chapter six, the end
[20:41] of chapter six here, Solomon, he's
[20:43] praying a prayer. And this is right
[20:44] after the temple has been built. And
[20:46] Solomon's praying a prayer. And the
[20:48] prayer, when you go back and read it,
[20:49] we're not going to not going to go into
[20:51] that right now, just for time's sake,
[20:53] but it sounds like a prayer for revival.
[20:56] They get the temple built. And then
[20:58] Solomon goes on and he prays this
[20:59] beautiful prayer. And then right here we
[21:02] have chapter 7 verse one. It says, "Now
[21:04] when Solomon had made an end of
[21:07] praying, it says the fire came down from
[21:10] heaven and consumed the burnt offering
[21:13] and the sacrifices and the glory of the
[21:15] Lord filled the house." Now, that I love
[21:18] that right there. Now, we serve a God of
[21:19] fire. We don't we don't serve a uh some
[21:23] God. We serve a God of fire. A God
[21:26] that will back up what his word says. A
[21:29] God that means what he said and he does
[21:31] what he said. We serve an accountable
[21:33] God. Now, there's a bunch of religions
[21:35] in the world that serve all these gods,
[21:36] but but when they need that God, where
[21:38] is he? Come on. When they need healing,
[21:41] where is that God at? But when we need
[21:43] healing, we know that there's a
[21:44] scripture that says by his stripes, we
[21:47] are healed. When we need peace, we know
[21:49] there's a scripture that says he was
[21:50] chastised for that peace. We have a God
[21:54] that's already paid a price. Thank you,
[21:56] Lord. And if we if we ever think we're
[21:59] too revelated or or the if we ever try
[22:01] and get away from that good news, the
[22:04] gospel means the good news. If we ever
[22:06] try and get away from preaching that
[22:08] atonement, that blood of Jesus Christ,
[22:10] we're right here at Easter. We're right
[22:11] here at the resurrection. You know what
[22:13] the resurrection will do for you? If you
[22:14] have a revelation of it, it'll explain
[22:16] every bit of your life that never made
[22:18] sense. Every bit of your life. You need
[22:21] the blood of Jesus Christ to explain it.
[22:24] And we will never get too revelated to
[22:27] to to look back and plead the blood of
[22:29] Jesus Christ. We're never If you feel
[22:31] like you've gotten farther than that,
[22:33] then you need to stop and you need to
[22:34] take a personal inventory. If we've
[22:37] gotten to a place,
[22:39] pass preaching the cross, preaching
[22:42] Calvary to the believers, preaching what
[22:44] Jesus has done for you. That's right.
[22:48] We're not going to We We can read the
[22:49] seals as many times as we want. We can
[22:51] listen to them as many times. the church
[22:53] ages. I love them all. But if we ever
[22:56] lose sight of the pinnacle of
[22:58] Christianity, which was Calvary, and
[23:00] what he did there, then none of it
[23:02] matters. If we let that slip our minds,
[23:05] not a bit of it matters.
[23:08] Come on. But he sends down that fire.
[23:10] You know that fire, it consumes our
[23:13] offerings of praise. That fire when it
[23:15] comes down, that pleases the Holy
[23:16] Spirit. When we get into a service and
[23:18] you're worshiping and you don't feel
[23:20] like raising your hand, but you raise
[23:21] your hand anyways. When you don't feel
[23:23] like saying amen because the day has
[23:24] been hard, but you say it anyways. When
[23:26] the word of God's coming forth, that
[23:29] pleases God. He He's pleased with your
[23:31] praises. And those praises and those
[23:33] offerings of praise, it goes up. You
[23:36] know what? He returns? He returns fire.
[23:38] A God of fire will then come down and
[23:41] he'll anoint the service. He'll anoint
[23:42] the preacher. He'll anoint your ears to
[23:44] hear. He'll anoint eyes to see. How do
[23:47] you think we get revelation? That's
[23:49] revelation through the Holy Spirit. It's
[23:51] not cuz some man told us something, but
[23:54] it's the Holy Spirit grabbing a hold of
[23:56] an elected seat of God and opening their
[23:59] eyes. Thank you, Lord. And we need that
[24:02] day. It's like it's like repentance in
[24:04] our life. It's not just a one-time deal
[24:06] at the very beginning. But Paul said, "I
[24:08] die daily." We have to repent time and
[24:11] time again. Repentance never stops.
[24:13] That's another thing. If repentance
[24:15] stops in our lives, we we need to stop
[24:17] right there and look back and see where
[24:19] we left Jesus at. Because if you don't
[24:21] have it on your heart to repent about
[24:23] something, well then you're perfect in
[24:25] the flesh. And we know that we're not
[24:27] perfect in the flesh. We know that
[24:28] through the blood of Jesus Christ, when
[24:30] he's looking at us, the price has
[24:32] already been paid. We're perfect in
[24:34] God's eyes in that way, but this flesh,
[24:36] we're still going to make mistakes while
[24:37] we're here. We're still going to have
[24:39] slip ups. Those things are going to
[24:41] happen. Not to be negative, but it's it
[24:42] is what it is. As long as we're in this
[24:45] fleshly body, those things are going to
[24:47] happen. Y Jeremiah 29 says, "Then I
[24:50] said, I will not make mention of him,
[24:52] nor speak anymore his name, but his word
[24:55] was in mine heart as a burning fire shut
[24:59] up in my bones." Now, when the revival
[25:02] strikes the church and we start running,
[25:03] that's what it is right there. That's
[25:05] when the that's when the word of God
[25:06] strikes the heart somewhere and it's
[25:09] just like burning fire in your bone. You
[25:11] can't sit still any longer. You can't
[25:13] sit in a service and and just nod. No,
[25:15] you throw a hand up. You might get out
[25:17] of your seat. You might walk in the
[25:19] aisle a little bit. You might run around
[25:21] some. But that's what that's what the
[25:23] word of God to a believer feels like
[25:25] when it strikes. It's life. That's what
[25:28] life does. It moves things. It makes
[25:30] things grow.
[25:31] And that's how we grow. That you know
[25:33] the story brother Brandham told about
[25:34] his daughter getting a turtle. And that
[25:37] turtle, he said it wouldn't come out of
[25:38] its shell. He said he'd sit there and
[25:41] he'd do do all these different things
[25:42] with it, but that turtle it just it
[25:44] would just sit there still. And he
[25:46] compared it to us. Well, not us today,
[25:50] but he compared it to them back then
[25:52] that they would just sit in their seats.
[25:53] They would see signs. They would see
[25:55] wonders. They would hear the word coming
[25:57] forth and they would just sit still.
[26:01] They didn't. This is a time of
[26:02] acceptance.
[26:04] Everything's been laid out. There's been
[26:05] a fullness. Why do we call it the
[26:08] fullness? There's been a fullness
[26:10] revealed in this day. A prophet came. We
[26:13] can't sit still any longer. It's time to
[26:15] accept it all. He preaches so much about
[26:18] God's redemptive blessings. They're all
[26:20] opened up. Everything that happened at
[26:22] Calvary, but now we do have to have, we
[26:24] got to be in the right condition to
[26:25] receive it. He talks about it, the
[26:28] church in its condition. He's preaching
[26:30] and he he talks about how Jesus came to
[26:32] John the Baptist there. And it said when
[26:34] Jesus came down into the water, the
[26:36] heavens opened up and the spirit came
[26:38] down like a dove. Well, that's exactly
[26:40] when the believer has been born again.
[26:43] That's that's you right there in a
[26:45] nutshell. The heavens open up to the
[26:47] believer. And you come down there. But
[26:50] he said if you have the nature of a
[26:52] wolf, that spirit will never come down
[26:54] on you. He said it'll fly off and it'll
[26:56] sit on a branch somewhere. It won't be
[26:58] too far away, but it's going to wait for
[27:00] you to get in a condition to where it
[27:01] can come upon you.
[27:04] It's going to wait for you to get in a
[27:05] spot where it wants to come upon you,
[27:07] where that dove spirit can drop down.
[27:09] And God want God wants revival more than
[27:12] we want revival. He wants to dwell in
[27:14] your heart more than you want him to
[27:16] dwell in your heart. But we have to be
[27:18] at a point where we can accept his word
[27:20] and accept all of his word. Where we can
[27:22] accept that it's all been open, that
[27:24] it's all ours. Because with the mindset
[27:27] that it's not all open and that it's not
[27:29] all ours, then you're we got a we got a
[27:31] halfway gospel here. We we got something
[27:33] that's not finished yet. But is it
[27:35] finished, church? Do you think it's
[27:37] finished? Do you think the word that
[27:39] we've been given the fullness of the
[27:40] word? You think Do we believe Malachi
[27:43] 4:5 and 6? Do we believe the scripture?
[27:46] Luke 17:30, Revelation 10:7. Do we think
[27:49] this is the days of the voice? If we
[27:52] believe it's the days of the voice, then
[27:54] believe that it's all open and that it's
[27:56] all yours. You know, Joshua, what he did
[27:59] when they got up to the promised land
[28:01] right there and Joshua, I think it's
[28:04] Let's flip over to Joshua real quick.
[28:06] I think it's
[28:16] good. I think it's Joshua chapter 18.
[28:19] Let's see. Yeah, Joshua chapter 18.
[28:22] We'll go verses 1 through3. It says,
[28:24] "And the whole congregation of the
[28:26] children of Israel assembled together at
[28:28] Shiloh and set up the tabernacle of the
[28:31] congregation there." Now listen to this
[28:33] next line. And the land was subdued
[28:36] before them. The land that that's you
[28:39] and I right now. Yeah. Every promise in
[28:43] the book, the land is subdued. They tied
[28:45] that land to the Holy Ghost.
[28:48] Yeah. He said, "And the land was subdued
[28:50] before them." And there remained among
[28:52] the children of Israel seven tribes
[28:54] which had not yet received their
[28:56] inheritance. What were they waiting for?
[28:58] Were they waiting for the right service?
[29:01] Yeah. where they waiting for somebody to
[29:03] to God ain't going to push you over and
[29:05] kick you over into that land. It's a
[29:07] time of acceptance. You got to walk over
[29:09] into that land. It's got to be by your
[29:12] own free will that you accept these
[29:15] promises of God. And it says, "And
[29:17] Joshua said unto the children of Israel,
[29:19] how long are ye slack to go to possess
[29:23] the land?" He said, he rebukes him.
[29:26] Joshua openly rebukes these seven tribes
[29:29] that are left. How long are you slack to
[29:31] go possess it? Right. Yeah. Well, what
[29:33] what were they saying? Were they saying,
[29:35] "Well, we don't believe Moses brought
[29:36] the fullness of the word. We don't
[29:37] believe we don't believe Moses told us
[29:39] everything. We don't believe We don't
[29:41] believe We're waiting on something
[29:42] different to come. So, now we can go
[29:43] over." No, we're not waiting on any of
[29:45] that. We're not waiting on none of those
[29:48] things. We're not looking for nothing.
[29:50] We're not waiting for nothing. Brother
[29:51] Brandham, he saw that spirit in people
[29:53] back then. He said, "There's people
[29:55] putting it off in the millennium." He
[29:57] said, "But you are sons and daughters
[29:59] right now." He said, "It's right now
[30:01] that you are." He said, "It's present
[30:04] tense for the believer. It's not
[30:06] something way off in another time, but
[30:09] it's here and it's now, and it's right
[30:10] for the taking, but are we taking it?
[30:13] Are are we are we realizing our rights
[30:15] in this hour? Everybody wants to talk
[30:16] about rights nowadays. Everybody's
[30:19] talking about that. This is my right.
[30:20] That's my right. I can be this. I can be
[30:22] that." Right. Well, the Christians need
[30:24] to think about their rights and what it
[30:26] holds, what the promise holds. Let's get
[30:30] back to this story on brother Brand on
[30:31] the that turtle that wouldn't come out
[30:33] of it shell. I'm just going to read it
[30:35] from the topper. He says, "That's just
[30:36] the way with some of this old cold
[30:39] formal religion you got today." He said,
[30:42] "I'll never go back to that revival
[30:43] again." He was quoting somebody right
[30:45] there. He says, "Shh." He said, "I
[30:48] belong to the Presbyterian, the
[30:49] Methodist, the Lutheran. My church don't
[30:51] believe in no emotion." All right. My
[30:52] church, what did brother Brandham say
[30:54] about a church with no emotion? Who
[30:56] knows what he said? Dead. Dead. I belong
[31:00] to the Presbyterian, the Methodist, the
[31:02] Lutheran. I belong to this. He said,
[31:04] "Hallelujah. He disagreed with me. I'm
[31:06] back up in the shell." He's speaking on
[31:09] the turtle there. He says, "Go on. Oh,
[31:10] that old closedin turtle religion. I
[31:13] don't want none of that closed in turtle
[31:15] religion. I want I want liberty in the
[31:18] house of God. I want to be free in here.
[31:20] That's what I want. I want to be open
[31:23] with God, but I want to take care of
[31:24] stuff first. I want to be in the right
[31:26] condition. I don't I don't want to come
[31:28] in here with a with a broken and wrecked
[31:31] heart, a broken and and wrecked attitude
[31:33] and bring that atmosphere and expect God
[31:34] to do something with me. No. Where's
[31:37] that dove spirit going to go? If we
[31:40] bring that into a church service, that's
[31:41] going to spread like a wildfire. Come
[31:43] on. You know, we want revival in here,
[31:46] but that attitude as well, that'll
[31:48] spread across the church. We get to
[31:49] talking in a church. We get to talking
[31:52] about each other in a church. And
[31:54] that'll spread just as fast as that
[31:56] spirit of God dropping into your heart
[31:58] will. That's a demonic spirit getting on
[32:00] there and spreading. Getting complexes,
[32:02] getting insecurities, saying, "Oh, that
[32:04] sister, she sideeyed me like this. I bet
[32:06] she thinks this about me. That sister,
[32:07] she ain't even thinking about you.
[32:10] Why Why do we Why do we do this to
[32:12] ourselves sometimes?
[32:14] It's just the devil getting in your way.
[32:17] It's just him trying to block the
[32:19] blessings of God from coming down into
[32:21] your life. Come on. He goes on. He says,
[32:24] "I said I'll fix him up and took him
[32:26] down to the creek." He said, "First, I
[32:27] got a stick. I tried to beat him. That
[32:29] didn't do no good. Just didn't do a bit
[32:31] of good. He just laid there and I just
[32:32] whipped him as hard as I could. He just
[32:35] laid there." He said, "You can't beat it
[32:36] into him. Not a bit." He said, "No, no
[32:39] need of trying it. It'll threaten him
[32:40] and everything." He said, "And I took
[32:42] him out." I said, "I'll fix him up." I
[32:44] stuck him down in the water. Just a few
[32:45] bubbles come up. He just stayed the same
[32:47] way. He said, "Well, you can sprinkle
[32:49] them, pour them backwards, forwards,
[32:51] anything you want to." That's right. He
[32:54] said, "They go down a dry center and
[32:55] come up a wet one." He said, "That's all
[32:57] still a center." He said, "You know how
[33:00] I made him move?" He said, "I went and
[33:02] got me a handful of sticks and built a
[33:04] little fire and sit the old boy on it."
[33:06] And that's what God will do in a
[33:08] service. He'll go get a handful of
[33:10] spiritual sticks and he'll put them
[33:11] underneath that seat you're sitting on
[33:13] and he'll light a fire under you. He'll
[33:16] start bringing you into remembrance of
[33:18] you come in and you're sick and you're
[33:20] afflicted and you're thinking, "Oh, woe
[33:21] is me." But God will get them sticks and
[33:24] he'll stick them under the believer and
[33:25] he'll put you in remembrance that I've
[33:27] done it once. I'll do it again. I'm
[33:29] still the God that can heal your body.
[33:31] I'm still the God that can heal your
[33:33] mind. I can touch you at any time of any
[33:35] day, but all you got to do is accept my
[33:38] provided way. There's no other provided
[33:40] way of healing. Right? We got to we can
[33:43] go to the doctor, but we got to accept
[33:45] his medicine. What the doctor's not
[33:47] going to do is just follow you around
[33:48] and nag you with it and poke you with
[33:50] it. No. He gives you the prescription
[33:52] and you got to take it. So reach out and
[33:54] take it. It's your right.
[33:58] [Music]
[34:00] He said, I tell you what the church
[34:01] needs today is an old time Holy Ghost
[34:03] fire kindled under her. He said, glory
[34:06] to God, that's what we need. Fire will
[34:08] move the church and nothing else. Yeah,
[34:11] fire will move the church and nothing
[34:13] else. Now, we don't want to I love that
[34:16] quote, but one thing we don't want to do
[34:18] is we don't want to live any we don't
[34:19] want to jump any higher and we're
[34:20] living. That's what the prophet said,
[34:22] too. We don't want to live any old way
[34:24] outside of these four walls. Come on.
[34:26] Come on. And then just come in here and
[34:28] and expect something from God.
[34:33] 2 Chronicles 7, let's go down to verses
[34:35] 13- 18.
[34:38] I believe this was a a it was either a
[34:41] dream or a vision right
[34:43] here Isaiah I
[34:47] believe or no Solomon I apologize
[34:50] Solomon he said if I shut up heaven that
[34:52] there be no rain or if I command a
[34:54] locust to devour the land or if I send
[34:56] pestilence among my people if my people
[35:00] this is the Lord here if my people which
[35:01] are called by my name shall humble
[35:04] themselves and pray and seek my face and
[35:07] turn from their wicked ways. Then will I
[35:09] hear from heaven and will forgive their
[35:11] sin and I will heal their land. Now to
[35:15] me right there following these things
[35:17] right here, this is key to revival
[35:19] sparking. And what did brother Brandham
[35:21] say was that what it showed a good
[35:24] revival. It was getting all the trash
[35:26] out that Lake Michigan when he was
[35:27] standing there. He said there wasn't one
[35:29] more bit of water in it from when it
[35:31] started kicking around to when it was
[35:33] still. He said the only purpose of all
[35:35] that happening was to get all the trash
[35:37] out of it. For all that all that
[35:39] rustling around, all that moving that
[35:41] water was doing, it was just to get all
[35:43] that trash up on the banks so it could
[35:45] be clean. And that's exactly what
[35:48] happens with us. He wants us clean. He
[35:50] wants to, "Oh Lord, create a clean heart
[35:53] in me." Was the prayer prayed. Renew a
[35:57] right spirit within me. Lord, maybe I've
[36:01] been out there and some bad spirits have
[36:02] got on me. Come on, buddy. Maybe some
[36:04] nasty stuff has got on me. Maybe I've
[36:06] looked at some things I shouldn't look
[36:07] at. Maybe I've felt some ways I
[36:09] shouldn't have felt towards a brother or
[36:11] a sister. Lord, renew a right spirit
[36:13] back in me. I don't want to feel that
[36:15] way anymore, Lord. I don't want to.
[36:17] Lord, even even better this prayer.
[36:19] Lord, reveal to
[36:21] me how I can receive something from you.
[36:24] Let's pray that prayer. Lord, if there's
[36:26] something I need to make right, if
[36:28] there's somebody I need to talk to,
[36:29] church, if we want revival, these have
[36:31] to be the prayers right here. We got to
[36:34] hit our knees and pray these prayers. I
[36:36] know this sounds boring. This doesn't
[36:38] sound like this doesn't sound like I'm
[36:40] praying for the power of God just to
[36:42] strike me. But we want God to be honest
[36:44] with us. And we have to be open to what
[36:46] he says. We have to have an open heart
[36:48] to God. We have to be willing to be
[36:51] obedient. Yes. Jesus Christ had an
[36:54] obedient heart. Yeah, that's what he had
[36:56] when he he said, "Take this cup from me.
[36:59] I don't want it." Maybe sometimes in
[37:00] your life there's things you don't want,
[37:02] but you don't understand why it's in
[37:04] your life. We serve the alpha and the
[37:07] omega. He can see farther than we can
[37:09] see. He knows to the end of the line.
[37:11] Sometimes we don't see why it's there.
[37:14] But it's there for a purpose. It's there
[37:16] for a reason. Yes, sir. And the sooner
[37:19] we can realize these things, sir. I
[37:22] believe God can do something with us. I
[37:24] believe God can move us. I believe we
[37:26] can work according to his purpose then.
[37:28] Not just our own anymore, but to his
[37:30] purpose. You know, David at Ziglag, a
[37:32] scripture that comes to mind, David at
[37:34] Ziglag, it's in 1st Samuel 30. And he
[37:36] had just he had been cast out by
[37:38] everybody at this point. Nobody wanted
[37:39] him. And he he had just came back and
[37:43] they had been ransacked and his wives
[37:44] were taken, his children were taken, all
[37:46] their stuff. The enemy had came. Does
[37:48] this sound familiar, church? The enemy
[37:50] came and took everything that was
[37:52] rightfully his. Does that sound
[37:54] familiar? Does that ever happen to you
[37:56] in your life? Now, sometimes when that
[37:58] happens, we try and take it into our own
[38:00] hands. We try and take control. We try
[38:03] and do it oursself. But what did David
[38:05] do at Ziklag? He said, "Go get me the
[38:07] Ephod before I do anything. Before I do
[38:10] anything off of brash emotion, sir.
[38:12] Before I do anything cuz I'm mad,
[38:14] because I'm hurting on the inside,
[38:16] because my heart's been broken. Before I
[38:19] do anything out of that, I'm going to
[38:21] drop to my knees. I'm going to put on
[38:23] the ephod and I'm going to consult the
[38:24] Lord about it. Oh yeah. And the Lord
[38:27] said to David, "Yes, you can go get it
[38:30] back." And then David goes and gets it
[38:32] back later. And he said, "David
[38:34] recovered every bit of it." And then you
[38:36] read on down a little bit farther and
[38:38] the Lord gave him even more. We serve an
[38:41] abundant God. We don't serve a God that
[38:43] we're just going to get a little bit
[38:44] back here just what we had at the
[38:46] beginning. But he's going to give you
[38:48] even more than you know is possible.
[38:50] Yeah. And I don't mean for that to sound
[38:51] like prosperity preaching, but that's
[38:53] the God that we serve. That's the truth.
[38:56] That's what he'll do. You've seen it in
[38:57] your lives already over and over again.
[39:00] You pray for something and you have it
[39:02] stuck in your head your way and just the
[39:04] amount you want. And he gives you 10
[39:06] times that amount. He gives you even
[39:08] more than that. You go in a service
[39:10] praying for healing and then you get
[39:12] slain in the spirit. You get struck and
[39:14] he gives you so much more. Right. He
[39:17] gives us more than He's given me more
[39:19] mercy and more grace in my life than I
[39:21] could ever think about.
[39:23] With all the stuff I've done in my life,
[39:26] with all the things we've done, he's
[39:27] given us so much. That's why that
[39:29] preaching of the cross, we can't get
[39:31] away from that preaching, church. We
[39:33] can't get away from looking back at
[39:35] Calvary. But the enemy, he's going to
[39:37] keep you thinking of of what you've done
[39:39] before. He's going to keep you looking.
[39:41] If he can keep you looking at your
[39:42] mistakes in your past, he can keep you
[39:44] from revival. If he can keep you
[39:47] thinking that you don't deserve revival,
[39:49] that you're not worthy of revival, that
[39:52] God wouldn't want to give you a revival
[39:53] in your heart, the enemy is going to
[39:56] keep you from that. And you know what we
[39:57] got to do with if we're going to look
[39:59] back at our past, the first thing we got
[40:02] to do if you're a born again believer,
[40:03] what you got to do first before you can
[40:05] look back at that past is you got to
[40:07] look past that cross right there. You
[40:09] got to look past what happened at
[40:10] Calvary. Because all of that, all that
[40:12] past that you're so easily remembering,
[40:14] it's in the sea or forgetfulness. It's
[40:16] not there anymore. God doesn't remember
[40:18] that. And if he doesn't remember that,
[40:20] why do we get so worked up about it? Why
[40:22] do we let that stuff afflict our mind so
[40:24] much? Take up so much of our our
[40:26] bandwidth up here.
[40:29] We got a memory, but we it doesn't have
[40:31] to be filled with that junk.
[40:33] Fill it with what's happened in a
[40:34] service. When you seen people get
[40:36] healed, when you seen people come down
[40:38] to the altar and cry their eyes out and
[40:40] give their heart to the Lord, fill it
[40:41] with that.
[40:43] Think on these things. These things that
[40:45] are good, these things that are
[40:46] worthwhile.
[40:48] Think on these things. That's what the
[40:49] word tells us.
[40:52] In the scripture, I got all
[40:55] all out of where we at 2 Chronicles
[40:59] 7:13-18. It says, "Now mine eyes shall
[41:02] be open and mine ears attent unto the
[41:04] prayer that is made in this place."
[41:05] That's right after he gives he lays some
[41:07] conditions here. He lays conditions of
[41:10] what he wants our condition to be or
[41:11] what he wanted their condition to be. He
[41:14] says, "Now mine eyes shall be open in
[41:15] mine ears a tent unto the prayer that is
[41:17] made in this place. For now I have cho
[41:20] have I chosen and sanctified this house
[41:23] that my name may be there forever and
[41:26] mine eyes and mine heart shall be there
[41:28] perpetually." And as for thee, if thou
[41:31] wilt walk before me as David thy father
[41:34] walked. Now, there's no guesswork here.
[41:35] The Lord's saying exactly what he's
[41:37] looking for. Come on. And I'm so happy
[41:38] he's done that in the scripture. How
[41:40] could he hold us accountable if he
[41:42] hadn't been completely transparent and
[41:44] told us what the believer should be in
[41:46] this day. But he's told us what he wants
[41:48] in this day. Yeah. That's so he can hold
[41:51] us accountable to his word. Thank you,
[41:53] Lord. It says, "And do according to all
[41:55] that I have commanded thee." Now, doing
[41:58] all that he's commanded us today, that
[42:01] may be giving up some of our free time,
[42:03] some of that me time that we cherish.
[42:05] Some of that time when it's when it's
[42:07] just me and I'm doing my own thing, that
[42:09] may be giving up your hobby time. That
[42:11] may be giving up a vacation or two.
[42:13] That's going to require sacrifice
[42:15] because Christianity, it is solely built
[42:18] on sacrifice. The prophet says in one
[42:20] place, Christianity is living for
[42:22] others. It's completely built on
[42:25] sacrifice. Jesus's whole ministry, it
[42:29] was built on sacrifice. If there was one
[42:32] example he said, that's what he wanted
[42:33] you to see. Is that living this way, li
[42:36] living that that straight and narrow
[42:38] way, it's going to require sacrifice.
[42:41] There may be things that look fun to do.
[42:43] There may be things that tickle the
[42:45] ears. There there may be a lot of
[42:47] glamour out there, but the prophet told
[42:48] us, he said, glamour is what gets the
[42:51] church in trouble. That's what got
[42:53] Jehoshaphat in trouble with Ahab. He
[42:55] came, the prophet tells us, he
[42:56] dramatized the story. He said Ahab took
[42:58] him into the kingdom and he started
[42:59] showing him all these shiny things. And
[43:01] when we're looking around out here,
[43:03] there's a lot of shiny things, church.
[43:05] There's a lot of things that catch your
[43:06] ear, catch your eye. The eye, what did
[43:08] he say? It was the gateway to the soul.
[43:12] We have to watch what we're looking at.
[43:14] We have to watch what we're feeding on.
[43:17] That's right. You know, there's these
[43:19] things the prophet talked about those
[43:20] little Amalachites.
[43:22] He said, "If you let them stay in your
[43:24] life, they're going to become a big
[43:25] Amalachite one day, and they're not
[43:27] going to have the same mercy on you that
[43:28] you had on them." And I think about
[43:30] that, maybe these little things in our
[43:32] lives that that's taking up a little bit
[43:34] too much time. These things that that
[43:37] maybe we're putting a little bit above
[43:38] God, that's priority number one, and
[43:40] maybe God's three or four or five or or
[43:42] somewhere in there. Wherever we can work
[43:44] them in at depending on what day of the
[43:46] week is. If we got this on Tuesday,
[43:48] well, he might knock down to seven that
[43:49] day. If we got this on a Wednesday
[43:51] night, he might knock down to 12 that
[43:52] day. Just wherever he's ranked at at
[43:54] that point. But these little
[43:56] Amalachites, these things that don't
[43:58] that don't they're not inherently sinful
[44:00] things in our lives. And I'm not going
[44:02] to start naming stuff because you
[44:03] probably already got some things in your
[44:05] mind right now when you start talking
[44:06] about these things in church. I've sat
[44:08] there on the pew before and just
[44:09] thought, "Well, the chair before, not
[44:11] the pew, the chair." But the things
[44:14] start popping in your mind. Well,
[44:15] actually, I put this above God this
[44:18] week. I put this above God this week. I
[44:19] I felt a nudge to go get into the word.
[44:22] I felt a nudge to go read my Bible, to
[44:24] listen to a tape. But instead, I did
[44:26] this. And that can be those little
[44:29] amalachites in our lives. And they start
[44:31] right there. And you give him some
[44:33] space. And you give the devil a foot in
[44:34] the door. And then he takes a mile. You
[44:37] give him an inch and he'll take a mile.
[44:40] You You give him five minutes of your
[44:41] time, he'll take an hour. Come on.
[44:45] And that's how it happens, church.
[44:47] That's a there's a spirit of compromise
[44:49] in the land in this day. There's a
[44:51] spirit that can get on us just the same
[44:53] as it can anybody out there and it'll
[44:55] slowly making you start compromising.
[44:58] And that's a slippery slope. You know,
[45:00] you don't you don't just see people one
[45:02] day they're they're a they're a
[45:04] full-fledged born again believer.
[45:06] They're this and they're that and then
[45:07] they're all of a sudden out in the
[45:08] world. No, it's a spirit of compromise.
[45:11] I'll do this and then I'll do this and
[45:13] the slope is slippery and you just go
[45:14] right to the bottom of it. And I don't
[45:16] mean that to sound negative, but that's
[45:17] the truth if we don't watch it. Because
[45:19] that spirit of compromise, what it tells
[45:21] the person is that Jesus Christ can live
[45:23] in this heart and so can that other
[45:26] thing. It says that both things can
[45:28] coincide. It says that you can have me
[45:30] and you can have Jesus. You you can have
[45:33] this little hobby that maybe might not
[45:35] be right. And the prophet said, "If
[45:37] there's a question in it, don't do it.
[45:40] Say it for me. Don't do it." Amen.
[45:44] But there's things like that in our
[45:45] lives. He goes on here. He says, "When
[45:47] Joshua entered the land of Canaan, he
[45:49] said, don't you let one of them live. If
[45:52] it's a cute little baby, a little
[45:53] Amalachite or Amorite," he said, "Kill
[45:55] it." He said, "You remember, he'll grow
[45:57] up to be an Amalachite. He'll pollute
[45:59] the camp. He'll pollute the camp in
[46:02] here. He'll pollute the heart is what
[46:04] it'll do." He said, "When those little
[46:06] things come back like that disagreeing
[46:08] with the word of God, get rid of that
[46:10] thing. I don't care what denomination it
[46:12] belongs to. You say, "Well, they're
[46:14] good. I don't care how good a people
[46:15] they are. If they're contrary to that
[46:17] word, you may say that about something
[46:19] in your life." Well, it's good. It's
[46:21] fun. I like doing it. Said, "I already
[46:24] wear long skirts. I already don't cut my
[46:26] hair. I already can't look like the
[46:27] fashion of the world. Why can't I just
[46:28] have this little thing?" It doesn't
[46:30] matter what it is. If it's getting in
[46:33] your the way of you're in God's
[46:34] relationship, if it's taking up God's
[46:37] time in our lives, now I'm preaching to
[46:39] myself here, too. I believe everybody
[46:41] can struggle with this.
[46:44] Because it's so easy to think, well, I'm
[46:45] not I'm not really doing nothing too bad
[46:48] here. I can't really find in a scripture
[46:50] where this is exactly wrong.
[46:54] But God will let you know if you'll seek
[46:55] him out and you'll say, "Lord, show me
[46:57] where I'm coming up short. Show me why I
[46:59] don't have that same joy I used to have
[47:01] in service. Show me why I'm not still
[47:03] free in service. What what's shackled me
[47:05] down, Lord? What's held me down? Be open
[47:08] with me, God. Talk with me. And when you
[47:11] do that with a sincere heart, when you
[47:14] seek God sincerely, he will show you.
[47:16] He'll open your eyes to whatever it may
[47:18] be. Lord, what's keeping me from being
[47:20] healed? Lord, I know what your word
[47:22] says. So, there has to be a block
[47:24] somewhere. There's got to be something
[47:25] blocking this healing of my body, this
[47:27] healing of my mind. Lord, what am I
[47:29] doing? Where am I falling short? These
[47:32] are questions we got to ask, church.
[47:35] There's Let's turn over to Nehemiah.
[47:42] I like his approach here. And Nehemiah's
[47:45] story, he goes back and he he builds the
[47:46] walls of Jerusalem up again.
[47:52] Very interesting character in the
[47:53] scripture.
[47:55] We'll try and move quickly through this
[47:58] here.
[48:01] But Nehemiah in the first chapter, the
[48:02] first thing he does, so he learns of it
[48:05] that this this brother comes to him and
[48:07] he he tells him about the state of
[48:09] Jerusalem. And the first thing Nehemiah,
[48:11] he's torn up about it. He doesn't know
[48:13] what to do. He he's he's confused. He
[48:16] well, you know, he he's tore up about it
[48:17] just in general. And the first thing
[48:19] that he does after he learns of this, he
[48:22] doesn't do anything else, but he
[48:24] repents. First thing, it's Nehemiah 1,
[48:26] it'll be verses 5- 11. He has a heart of
[48:29] repentance. Yeah. Nehemiah drops down
[48:31] and he says, "Lord, I'm sorry. I'm sorry
[48:33] for what the people have done. I'm sorry
[48:35] for what I've done. I'm sorry for all of
[48:37] this." And he asked for I believe
[48:39] Nehemiah is asking for some restoration.
[48:42] He's asking for some revival.
[48:45] He's going to need help. He's not going
[48:47] to revive himself. He's not going to
[48:49] restore himself. We don't restore
[48:51] ourselves.
[48:52] The Lord Jesus Christ and the blood of
[48:54] Jesus Christ has to restore us. It has
[48:57] to revive us. It That's the only thing
[48:59] that can fix a broken heart, a contrite
[49:01] heart, as Psalm 51 says, is the blood of
[49:04] Jesus Christ. You can work on it. You
[49:07] You can You can go to psychology
[49:09] classes. Come on. You can go see You can
[49:11] see a therapist. Nothing wrong with it
[49:13] if anybody does it.
[49:15] But the only thing that's going to fix
[49:17] it long term is the blood of Jesus
[49:20] Christ. If another man or another woman
[49:22] can fix it for you, the devil can break
[49:24] it again just as fast. and he will.
[49:27] He'll let you go on that that long that
[49:29] long escapade, that long adventure and
[49:32] see where that'll lead.
[49:34] But then you get out there again and
[49:36] he'll just break it one more time.
[49:39] First thing Nehemiah did, he repented.
[49:41] The very first thing and then I like
[49:43] when he finally gets to Jerusalem, what
[49:45] he does is he rides around Jerusalem.
[49:47] He's going to look at all the damage.
[49:49] He's going to see everything that's been
[49:51] broken, everything that's been damaged.
[49:54] And that's what we have to seek out in
[49:56] our lives. Lord, why do I feel this way
[49:58] about this person? Lord, why do I feel
[50:00] this way about this? What's been damaged
[50:02] in me? What needs fixing? What do I have
[50:05] a callous heart somewhere? Have I been
[50:07] rubbed wrong? You know, a callous, it's
[50:08] caused by friction. And sometimes, so
[50:11] many a time, we can that'll happen to
[50:13] our hearts. People do stuff to us.
[50:16] Things happen in our lives and we get
[50:18] little calluses on our heart and that
[50:19] shuts us off in that area. We don't let
[50:22] anybody in that area. That's our spot.
[50:24] That's our spot where nobody can get by.
[50:26] Nobody can touch. And you know what
[50:28] happens? I was counseling one of my
[50:30] friends recently. He He's not a
[50:31] believer. And I was counseling about his
[50:34] marriage and his wife had done something
[50:36] that calloused his heart. She had been
[50:37] unfaithful in a way. And it had
[50:39] calloused his heart. And as we we were
[50:42] digging deeper in their lives, all they
[50:44] had done right right when one of their
[50:46] hearts will get calloused because of
[50:47] something the other one did, then the
[50:49] other one's heart would be callous
[50:50] because they'd get back at them. They'd
[50:51] lash out. they'd go at them again. And
[50:54] so we dug through all these calluses in
[50:56] their heart. And then we look even
[50:57] deeper in their lives. And this is each
[50:59] one of us here tonight. There's things
[51:01] from when we were small that's calloused
[51:03] us, that's put a scar on our lives,
[51:05] that's that's burdened us in certain
[51:08] areas of our lives. And that's things we
[51:11] have to fight through. If we want
[51:12] revival in the heart, we got to get rid
[51:15] of those things. And those things right
[51:17] there, nobody gets rid of but Jesus
[51:19] Christ. That's right. The these are real
[51:21] things that we have to deal with,
[51:22] church. If we're coming in here and
[51:24] we're if we're just saying we want
[51:26] revival so somebody will run up and down
[51:28] these aisles, well, that's not what
[51:29] we're looking for. I'm looking for a
[51:31] life to be changed. I'm looking I'm
[51:33] looking for more of the Holy Ghost. I'm
[51:36] looking for more of him in here. That's
[51:39] what I'm looking for. I love the spirit
[51:41] dropping on people. I like to see people
[51:43] running, screaming, shouting. I love it,
[51:45] church. But what we're looking for is a
[51:49] real heartfelt revival. What we're
[51:51] looking for is something that's going to
[51:53] get us ready to leave this place one of
[51:54] these days. That's what we're looking
[51:57] That's the bride's revival. Getting
[51:59] ready to go home. Come on. That's what
[52:01] we're looking for. Something to light us
[52:03] on fire and get ready for the coming of
[52:05] the Lord. Thank you, Lord. But sometimes
[52:07] we sit here and we we just we we don't
[52:09] look like we're ready for the coming of
[52:11] the Lord sometimes, church. And I'm
[52:13] talking to me again, too. Sometimes I
[52:15] sit in a church service and I think,
[52:16] "How can I expect God to take me home
[52:18] one day when I'm sitting here with with
[52:20] this thought in my mind with this
[52:21] thought about somebody else with this
[52:23] feeling in my heart? How can I expect
[52:26] that from God? Have I fulfilled what he
[52:29] expects of me? Am I living how he
[52:31] expects me to live? Am I walking his
[52:34] way?" Cuz it's easy to walk that way
[52:36] that's wide that everybody's going down.
[52:39] But church, that's not what we're called
[52:41] to. Come on. We're called to a road
[52:43] that's very narrow to to a to a
[52:45] oneperson road. A believer's road. And
[52:48] that's a road of sacrifice.
[52:51] It it it's a road of giving anything.
[52:53] Everything's on the table for the Lord
[52:54] Jesus Christ.
[52:56] That's right.
[52:59] So Nehemiah goes on and he urged them to
[53:01] build so it wouldn't be a reproach any
[53:04] longer. He looked at those walls of
[53:05] Jerusalem as a reproach. He looked at it
[53:08] as a disgrace. We've let the enemy come
[53:10] in and destroy our our place of
[53:12] habitation. We've let the enemy come in
[53:15] and destroy God's chosen people's place.
[53:18] Yes. And that can happen again today. We
[53:21] let the enemy come in and destroy our
[53:23] lives. We let him rule in certain areas.
[53:25] We let him have stuff that's not his. It
[53:27] reminds me of Shamgar. That that story
[53:30] that the prophet told Shamgar. He
[53:32] dramatized a little bit and he those
[53:33] Shamgar got all his stuff up in his barn
[53:35] and the Philistines came walking down
[53:37] the road and they were going to take it
[53:38] from him. one more time. Everything that
[53:40] was rightfully shamguards was stored up
[53:42] there. Everything he had to feed his
[53:44] family. Right. And you know that that's
[53:47] a good point right there. You know,
[53:48] sometimes the devil steals so much from
[53:50] you. Us with families, we don't have
[53:52] enough to feed them. We don't have
[53:54] enough to give them. Us with children,
[53:56] you'll let the enemy steal from you so
[53:58] much. There's none of you left to pour
[54:00] into your children. How do we expect to
[54:02] have a youth that's on fire for God if
[54:04] we're not on fire for God? If we
[54:06] constantly let the enemy steal and take
[54:09] and steal and take and we don't got
[54:11] nothing left for our kids no more. How
[54:14] we expect them to be on fire. You know
[54:15] the prophet said he said that the
[54:17] revival let me I might have the quote
[54:19] here. I got it right here. He said warm
[54:21] up to God. He said come back to him. He
[54:23] said throw your heart out to him. He
[54:25] said I was reading a sermon the other
[54:26] night about our sister Brown here at the
[54:28] conference down there and yes he was
[54:30] talking about a woman preacher. He said
[54:32] and how she preached the Calvary road a
[54:34] road of sacrifice. What a masterpiece of
[54:36] a sermon that was what people need
[54:38] today. I promise I'm not advocating for
[54:40] women preachers. I didn't come here to
[54:41] do that. I promise.
[54:44] He said, "What a We got Joel, so that's
[54:46] bad enough. We don't
[54:48] need I apologize, church. I just had to
[54:50] say that, you know, inspiration that
[54:52] came to me." He said, "But what a
[54:54] masterpiece of a sermon that was." He
[54:56] said, "What people need today is get
[54:58] back on that self-sacrifice.
[55:01] lay your all on the altar and forget who
[55:03] you are, but the son of God or the
[55:05] daughter of God. He said, "Walk forward.
[55:07] Claim every promise God's got for you.
[55:09] There will be a revival that will shake
[55:11] New York like never shook before." And
[55:13] on this quote, I like to right there
[55:15] where it says shake New York. Insert the
[55:17] city you're living in. Put the name of
[55:19] your It'll shake Hardy like it's never
[55:21] shook before. That's not just in New
[55:24] York. That's to anywhere if we can go by
[55:26] what this quote says. He said, "Men,
[55:27] come back and men and women come back to
[55:29] God. Come back to the place." He said,
[55:32] "I don't mean come back to church. I
[55:34] mean, come back to God. Let every home
[55:37] start a revival." He said, "That's
[55:40] right. Turn out the beer cans. Throw out
[55:41] the card party."
[55:43] And there you go again. Whatever you got
[55:45] that's keeping you back from revival,
[55:48] insert it right there. Turn out the
[55:50] whatever it is. throw out the whatever
[55:53] it is that's holding your life back,
[55:55] that's holding your heart back from a
[55:57] God-scent revival in this hour. We have
[56:00] to get in that dove condition. We can't
[56:02] have that nature of a wolf on us any
[56:04] longer, church. We can't carry that
[56:06] around with us. It spreads. He said,
[56:08] "What we need today is an oldfashioned
[56:11] God- sent revival." He said, "Clean up
[56:13] the home. Clean up the heart." He said,
[56:16] "Get things ready." I love this right
[56:18] here. He says, "Start a revival in your
[56:20] home and it will begin at church." Start
[56:24] a revival in your home and it'll begin
[56:26] at church. Because what the young people
[56:28] don't like to see is mommy and daddy
[56:30] being one way at home out there and then
[56:32] and then coming in here and turning into
[56:34] a worshshiper all of a sudden, turned
[56:36] into somebody that's praising the Lord
[56:38] all of a sudden. That's right. Because
[56:40] that that's a double standard. Nobody
[56:42] likes a double standard. Nobody likes a
[56:44] hypocrite. You know, a lot of people had
[56:46] their idea of the great falling away in
[56:48] this day. Yeah. And you know what the
[56:50] prophet said? You know, we try we try
[56:51] and say the great falling away and we
[56:53] try and point at this group and point at
[56:54] that group and and say it's them, it's
[56:56] them because they believe this way and
[56:58] they believe that. But what he what he
[56:59] attributed to the great falling away was
[57:02] a lukewarm condition of the church.
[57:04] That's what he said. The great falling
[57:05] away was the lukewarm fence riding
[57:08] condition of the church. That's what he
[57:11] called it right there. Right. that
[57:13] spirit of compromise coming in telling
[57:15] you you can have Jesus and you can have
[57:16] this too. You can have both of them. But
[57:19] church, we can't have both of them. As
[57:21] he goes on here, he says, "Preacher,
[57:23] don't bring it in his briefcase." He
[57:25] said, "God sends it from heaven to the
[57:28] individuals." That's true. He sends it
[57:32] straight to the individual's heart.
[57:34] Amen. We are the revival, church. You
[57:37] are the revival. You sitting there, it's
[57:39] you're the revival. That's a
[57:41] responsibility from the scripture. What
[57:43] did the Welsh revival man say when they
[57:46] walked up to him? He was on the job. You
[57:48] know who's talking about the revival at
[57:49] their job here? Raise your hand. But he
[57:52] was on the job. He was twirling that
[57:54] baton. And they said, "Where's that
[57:55] revival?" And he said, "That revival is
[57:58] right here." And if this revival isn't
[58:00] right here, church, how are we going to
[58:01] bring in the end? What are they going to
[58:03] see that's different? Are they going to
[58:04] see a different life?
[58:07] We got to show them a different life,
[58:08] church. And that starts with revival in
[58:10] the heart right here. That starts with
[58:11] taking that revival home. Not just
[58:13] getting happy here, but getting happy at
[58:15] home with the kids. Reading that Bible
[58:17] at night. Listen to them tapes with the
[58:19] kids. Reading the Bible with the kids.
[58:20] Come on. Toss the TVs out. Toss the
[58:23] movies out. Toss those things out. When
[58:25] did it come back in? How did it slip
[58:27] back in? Yeah. Let's get rid of these
[58:30] things, church. Let's move on with God.
[58:33] Move on past these things. Yes, sir.
[58:35] Come on. Amen. Good preaching. as
[58:38] musicians come, we can we'll go ahead
[58:40] and close it down. Joel only gave me a
[58:42] few minutes up here, so I guess I'll
[58:51] Brother Ben gave me four hours. Joel
[58:52] gave me like 14 minutes.
[58:56] So, I'll just read a few more quotes
[58:58] here,
[59:00] church. Prophet says, "So revival in our
[59:03] day." He said, "How can we have it when
[59:05] the regular revival giver is bound by
[59:08] the world?" And that's a question we got
[59:11] to ask ourselves. Come on. If it's bound
[59:13] by the world, how are we going to get
[59:15] it? God won't come in where the world
[59:18] is. He said, "You can just depend on
[59:20] that." He said, "You associate with the
[59:23] world, then it's all of it." He said,
[59:25] "When you let the world creep in, you go
[59:27] to acting like the world, then you are
[59:29] finished. But when you'll cut loose
[59:31] every feder from the world and come to
[59:34] God. Now I know many of us here have
[59:36] probably had the initial coming to God.
[59:39] But it it but the prophet said it's
[59:41] birthed into this, birthed into this,
[59:43] birthed into this. We're not going to
[59:45] we're not going to get to a point where
[59:46] we receive enough of the Holy Spirit.
[59:48] Come on. I want to keep receiving it. I
[59:51] want more and more. I want the mercies.
[59:53] He says in Lamentations 3, I want the
[59:55] mercies to be new every day.
[59:58] That's what revival is. Like it's the
[1:00:00] first time again. Like the first time
[1:00:02] when you remember Jesus Christ touching
[1:00:04] your heart. When you remember him
[1:00:06] whispering you. When you remember
[1:00:07] realizing I didn't do nothing to earn
[1:00:09] this. I'm
[1:00:11] unworthy. I was no good. But by the
[1:00:14] grace of God, by God's election in this
[1:00:18] hour, he chose me.
[1:00:21] Put that in remembrance, church. Put
[1:00:23] that in your mind.
[1:00:25] He said, "When you let the world creep
[1:00:27] in, you go to acting like the world,
[1:00:28] then you are finished. But when you'll
[1:00:29] cut loose every fetter from the world
[1:00:31] and come to God, God will use you until
[1:00:33] you go to flirting again." He said,
[1:00:35] "Here's the only hope that I have this
[1:00:37] morning to wind up my message is this.
[1:00:39] While Samson was bound, a new shock of
[1:00:42] hair growth out while he was bound." In
[1:00:45] another place, he said, "Revive us, O
[1:00:48] Lord." Maybe let's bow our heads while
[1:00:50] we read this one. This was a prayer the
[1:00:52] prophet prayed. He said, "Revive us, oh
[1:00:54] Lord. Send your holy spirit upon us and
[1:00:57] bring forth the refreshing, the dew
[1:00:59] drops of mercy from above." He said, "Oh
[1:01:02] God, revive our community here." He
[1:01:05] said, "Revive the whole city. Revive the
[1:01:08] churches around. Revive the
[1:01:12] Methodists. Or should we say, revive the
[1:01:15] other Methodist churches, too. I don't
[1:01:16] just want Christ in my heart, but I want
[1:01:18] it in everybody's heart." He said,
[1:01:21] "Revive the Methodist. Revive the
[1:01:22] Baptist. Revive all of them, Lord. And
[1:01:24] oh God, may it begin right here in this
[1:01:27] congregation. Let that be your prayer
[1:01:29] tonight, church. May there be such a
[1:01:32] reviving and awakening among us, Lord,
[1:01:35] till the Holy Ghost taking our hearts
[1:01:37] and tearing us apart and squeezing from
[1:01:40] us the precious ointment that he would
[1:01:42] desire for our church to be anointed
[1:01:45] with. He said, "Grant it, Lord."
[1:01:47] [Music]
[1:01:48] And another place he said, "We need a
[1:01:50] revival of love amongst the children of
[1:01:53] God." Heavenly Father, we just ask that
[1:01:56] you would touch each heart here, oh God,
[1:01:58] that you would that you would send the
[1:02:01] revival giver into this service, Lord.
[1:02:02] That you would send them to each and
[1:02:04] every heart that has a need, that's
[1:02:07] hurting in their body, that's hurting in
[1:02:08] their mind, that has any affliction.
[1:02:10] Lord, let them know who they are, Lord.
[1:02:12] The we believe that the land is subdued
[1:02:15] before us, Lord, as the scripture said.
[1:02:17] And father, we don't want to be one of
[1:02:18] those that you rebuke that you have to
[1:02:20] you have to say, "Why haven't you taken
[1:02:22] the inheritance?" But Lord, we want to
[1:02:24] freely accept every promise of God right
[1:02:26] now on the basis on the rock of the
[1:02:29] revelation of Jesus Christ. We accept
[1:02:31] the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:02:33] tonight. And Father, we plead the blood
[1:02:37] over anything in our lives, over
[1:02:39] everything in our lives. It doesn't just
[1:02:41] have to be bad. But Lord, we want you,
[1:02:43] Lord. We can't even walk without you
[1:02:45] holding our hand. Hallelujah.
[1:02:48] Lord, we depend on your grace and on
[1:02:50] your mercy. And we thank you for all
[1:02:53] you've done for us in Jesus Christ's
[1:02:55] name.
[1:02:56] [Music]
[1:03:01] Amen. Within me.
[1:03:05] [Music]
[1:03:09] has
[1:03:10] created
[1:03:12] me a clean
[1:03:16] heart. Stand together while we sing it.
[1:03:19] Oh
[1:03:22] God, why don't you raise your hand and
[1:03:24] sing it to him today? The right
[1:03:28] spirit within me. Maybe on a Wednesday
[1:03:33] night, you could just ask him, "Lord, I
[1:03:34] I need revival. I need it in my home.
[1:03:38] Cast me not
[1:03:41] away from thy
[1:03:47] presence, oh
[1:03:50] Lord. Oh, take off thy
[1:03:56] holy spirit from
[1:03:59] me. Oh granny, Lord, make it your prayer
[1:04:02] now. Oh, won't you
[1:04:06] restore unto
[1:04:09] [Music]
[1:04:12] me of thy
[1:04:16] salvation. Oh, sing it now. And renew
[1:04:21] arise
[1:04:23] spirit within you.
[1:04:30] Well, I think that ought to stir us up
[1:04:31] tonight to go home and get down on our
[1:04:34] knees. I I felt stirred. Just a simple
[1:04:37] message tonight, but I felt stirred. I I
[1:04:40] need a revival. Need a revival in my
[1:04:43] home. I You go around the walls and you
[1:04:46] start just walking around Brother Jared.
[1:04:47] you get to look and you think that got
[1:04:49] broke down and and the fire burnt that
[1:04:51] and and maybe like you said, you get
[1:04:54] around and start looking say I got a bad
[1:04:55] feeling against that person or or or I
[1:04:58] started to think ill of that person.
[1:05:00] Just just let the Lord come in and take
[1:05:02] all that out. Could we just pray that
[1:05:04] way? Lord, by by the time Sunday morning
[1:05:06] comes around, I just want to be clean,
[1:05:09] Lord. I I want to be right. I I want
[1:05:11] things to be right in my family. I I
[1:05:13] want the spirit of God to have the
[1:05:15] freedom to move in every area of my
[1:05:17] life. Not every door would be open.
[1:05:20] Every every heart would be right. Amen.
[1:05:23] Let's just make that our prayer and our
[1:05:26] desire. We had a a good experience at
[1:05:29] camp. I watched Brother Ryan
[1:05:33] uh dear. He uh he really had an
[1:05:37] experience with God. I watched him. He
[1:05:39] got to every service. the first person
[1:05:41] in the building usually and he was the
[1:05:44] last person to leave and uh he had told
[1:05:49] me that he wanted to be baptized and and
[1:05:53] uh brother Ryan said he was baptized as
[1:05:55] a young child but he didn't really know
[1:05:56] what he was doing. He said, "Brother
[1:05:58] Ben, I want to be rebaptized and he want
[1:06:01] to be rebaptized tonight." And we've got
[1:06:03] water in the in the tank. So, we're
[1:06:06] going to do that for brother Ryan
[1:06:07] tonight. And uh just that, brother Ryan,
[1:06:10] that same Holy Spirit that set you on
[1:06:12] fire at camp, he can be with you every
[1:06:14] day of your life. And we just pray that
[1:06:17] he'll be filled with the Holy Ghost and
[1:06:19] and just make a difference in his family
[1:06:21] and in a in in his community. And you
[1:06:25] never know what God can do. He could
[1:06:26] take one of these young men and set a
[1:06:28] family on fire and and or a young woman,
[1:06:32] a young lady sitting here, set your
[1:06:33] family on fire, set your home on fire,
[1:06:36] your school, wherever you're at. People
[1:06:37] can say there's a difference there. We
[1:06:40] still believe in this church. We, you
[1:06:42] know, we we believe we we're at a end
[1:06:45] time. We're very far along in these
[1:06:47] things, but we still believe in revival.
[1:06:50] And from time to time, we need to come
[1:06:52] back and say, "Lord, cleanse me, oh God.
[1:06:55] Create a right spirit in my heart.
[1:06:57] Nothing else matters if I don't have
[1:06:59] you. Lord, I I need you. I need you to
[1:07:02] move." So, we're going to worship just a
[1:07:05] minute. And if you need prayer, the
[1:07:06] altar's open. Don't hesitate to come and
[1:07:09] we'll be pray for you. Then Josh will
[1:07:11] pray with you and I will as well. But if
[1:07:14] you uh we'll we'll just worship for just
[1:07:16] a little bit and then we'll go and and
[1:07:18] just like we normally do go right over
[1:07:21] if you need to go at that time. You can
[1:07:23] go ahead and go home if you need to or
[1:07:25] you can go with us and we'll just
[1:07:26] continue the service at the fellowship
[1:07:28] hall as we baptize brother. Do you love
[1:07:31] the Lord tonight? Aren't you glad that
[1:07:33] he spoke to your heart tonight? Amen.
[1:07:36] Let's sing this now. Oh,
[1:07:39] restore us. Oh, sing it to him now,
[1:07:43] church. Make it your prayer. The joy joy
[1:07:47] of
[1:07:47] thy
[1:07:49] salvation. Sing it
[1:07:52] now. Oh, and renew a bright
[1:07:57] spirit within
[1:08:00] me. Cast me in a way. One more time.
[1:08:04] Oh, just
[1:08:06] cast me on
[1:08:11] away from thy
[1:08:15] presence, oh
[1:08:19] Lord, and
[1:08:21] take not thy
[1:08:24] holy spirit from
[1:08:31] thee. Won't you
[1:08:35] restore unto
[1:08:39] me the joy of thy
[1:08:48] salvation and renew a right
[1:08:52] spirit within me?

[1:10:21] appreciate you. Holy Spirit, you're a
[1:10:24] comfort. Can we sing it this way one
[1:10:26] time? Oh, Holy
[1:10:29] Spirit, you're a
[1:10:32] comfort to
[1:10:35] [Music]
[1:10:37] me. Oh, Holy
[1:10:40] Spirit, you're a
[1:10:43] comfort to me.
[1:10:45] [Music]
[1:10:49] Oh, you lead
[1:10:52] me. You guide
[1:10:54] me. You're
[1:10:57] dwelling inside me. Holy
[1:11:02] Spirit, you're a
[1:11:05] comfort to me. One more before we go.
[1:11:10] I'm glad that
[1:11:14] mercy
[1:11:16] rerote my
[1:11:20] life. Oh, I'm glad that
[1:11:25] mercy
[1:11:27] re my life. Oh, can you just tell him
[1:11:31] tonight that you're thankful? Oh, yes. I
[1:11:36] should have
[1:11:38] fallen my
[1:11:41] soul. Cast
[1:11:45] down
[1:11:48] first.
[1:11:50] Rroll my
[1:11:53] life. Just play that. Amen. Just play
