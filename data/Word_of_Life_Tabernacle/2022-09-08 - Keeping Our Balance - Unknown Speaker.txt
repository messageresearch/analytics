the lighthouse i owe my life to him lord jesus is the lighthouse and from the rocks of sin he has shown a lie all around me so that i could clear see if it wasn't for that lighthouse tell me where

and call him our father amen god bless you tonight we'll go to the word here in just a moment you can be seated for a moment if you will just got a couple of things to go over uh we've uh but you've probably noticed and uh that uh sister noli uh jackson and levi eucla have been coming to church and uh and they've been uh going with one another for a while i actually grew up together i've known these kids for a long time i think of them as kids because they were i think both about six years old when i met them and uh was in church with them for about a decade and and boy they got old fast i don't age at all during that time i didn't age at all but they got old fast but but they're they've grown up and it's it's been my privilege to work with them as they're uh contemplating marriage and so they are now officially engaged so let's let's give them a hand tonight it's always a blessing to see a young couple start to come to church and and they wanted to stay in church and they've decided to make this their church home and so we're we want to welcome them and if there's anything we can do for you and uh we'll be here for you and as a church i think they're going to try to do their wedding here and so we'll just try to be a part and and they don't have other family here so let's try to be as friendly as we can and support this young couple and be a part of their lives we're family aren't we and uh we we are closer sometimes to people we go to church with than we are to our own families and and there's a reason for that we have something in common and that something is the lord jesus amen and that's a god bless you guys i i wish you the best and congratulations from for me and my wife uh we uh had a little work done peter if you can pull up brother robert hill brother robert there pull up that uh slide it's not in my sermon notes but uh there's a slide there from uh of a sermon that we translated into arabic and so this is our first one we've done first full sermon we did a couple of booklets while we were there but this one's got done just a couple of days ago so i was so excited to see this for the believers there you're we're reaching a part of the world that has never been reached with the message and as far as i know is the first time this sermon's ever been translated into arabic and so thank you for that thank you for being a part and for putting your finances behind it your prayers behind it and this church is as small as we are but we've really uh had an impact in the country of egypt you have and and by being able me and brother joel were able to go because of you and so we're grateful for that and they're trying to get us to come back i'm trying to find a way for me not to go and maybe send brother joel but they're going to have some meetings in february and we'll be praying just keep them in your prayers there's some good people there and they're poor people but they really love the lord and so i wanted to show that to you let you know there's work ongoing and actually another pastor just this week has let me know he's going to be supporting it as well and other pastors are looking at it so we're we're excited about that and we can't do it all ourselves we run out of money pretty quick we found out on that trip but but the lord has blessed us and i i thank you for that and and for your giving spirit and and for your prayers we thank you beyond our expectations and now we're beginning to get the message in a place uh where it's not been and so we're thankful for that when that last one comes in we get to go home and there ain't nothing bigger than that all right amen i want to see this young couple get married but if the lord comes ahead of time hey i'm okay with that amen i i want to see the last one come in and so maybe they'll read that book and you've had a hand in translating it so you remember that we have another a couple of services probably on jonah but i'm going to go away from that tonight and touch on something else this weekend i won't be here brother stewart will be here sunday morning by the malachi got on sunday afternoon if you can to stay for that sunday afternoon service i know it's hard right now it's not going to be that hot we are getting a new ac unit probably next week i believe something like that what's that tomorrow praise god so if he's able to do that tomorrow you'll have air conditioning so you won't have any excuse to be be here with brother malachi and i just since i'm not going to be here he's a young minister and i feel like that we should support him as a church he seems like a real determined young man he's got family here in the church so let's be praying for that and then we'll be gone this weekend but we'll be coming back and i'll be here next wednesday let's stand together do you love the lord tonight isn't god good to us beyond our wildest expectations and dreams and you don't know what tomorrow holds we found that out as studying jonah and will continue to do that we found out that we don't have control over the big picture god does god does and they we may find ourselves in the belly of a fish but god knows why we're there and he's going to make it work for our good and i'm so grateful for that let's bow our heads once again for a word of prayer heavenly father lord we're so grateful to be here in your presence and to know that you're near and you're you're with us every every day and we thank you for that lord especially with this group of people how it warms my heart on a wednesday night to see them come together and and lord some of them elderly some of them young but lord a group of people that can come together and hear your word and those also that are watching tonight i i pray you give them a special blessing lord that you give us strength to to fight the battle lord to keep pressing lord spreading the light lord we didn't bring the light but we can spread it lord and we can become the word lord revealed word to our generation i pray you'd help us to do that lord we pray until that great day that you come and take us home we ask it in jesus name amen amen matthew 23 23 i just want to read this one verse of scripture just something i had them on my heart you just bear with me in my folly tonight if you will and i want to speak to you tonight uh about keeping our balance keeping our balance we sure want to do that don't we in the word of god matthew 23 23 woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you pay tithes of mint and anees and cumin and have omitted the weightier matters of the law judgment mercy and faith these ought you to have done and not to leave the other undone for the lord would add his blessing to the word you may be seated this evening men die but spirits don't the pharisees were almost like the pentecostals of their day they they believed in miracles and the sadducees did not they were more like the fundamentalist group of the day that we live in today we might identify that with the baptist church or the lutheran church something like that with the old-line protestantism and and the pharisees were more like the pentecostals of their day and you see that and why jesus spent more time with the pharisees because i they they actually had more interest in his ministry than the sadducees did the sadducees were actually the ruling party in that day the pharisees didn't even run the country the high priest was a sadducee but the pharisees were the ones if we could put it that way closest to the light and they were also the ones that were the most wrong because they were closer but they couldn't see that christ was there in flesh and and so jesus tells them he says you you've neglected the weightier matters of the law you've omitted or you failed to deal with the weightier matters of the law and the reason why you've omitted the weight of your matters which he identifies as as judgment mercy and faith he said you failed to identify or to include that in your preaching in your practice in your teaching you failed to include that and instead you've included uh you've included these things that are in the law that are just maybe on the edges of it and you've made your opinions to be gospel and when you make your opinions the gospel you've added to the word what the pharisees did is they did something that theologians call they fenced the law they fenced the law and what that means is that they they would put fences around the law so a good example is is thou shalt not take the name of thy lord thy god in vain they would take that and not only would they not do that consciously but they said well if we say god's name we may be taking it in vain so what they would do is they would just remove all the vowels they actually did that they removed all the vowels from the name of god and so they would not say and even today a a conservative jew will not say god's name even when they write it there will be a g and a slash and a d there won't be a a vowel there because they built a fence around that commandment and you say well that's a good thing well but he didn't just say if you take away from the word but if you add to it so jesus goes on and we'll read it later to talk about how that they bound up heavy burdens and what that is is they would actually create a law they would create word things that had to be followed and judge people based off of that instead of looking at the weightier matters of the law so you find again one party denied miracles and the resurrection the other believed they were saved by their works both were wrong now the pharisees in particular lacked balance because they neglected these weightier matters and i just preached to you from my heart tonight it's disheartening to see folks today settling into those camps and i don't want us to ever do that and if we have done that at times i know what times the church will go a certain direction and and then it'll move back another direction and that's normal you don't hold a steering wheel steel when you're going down the highway right it moves and so you're actually constantly there's play in the steering wheel and in order for you to go straight and so many times you'll go back and forth but we want to stay as close as we can with the scriptures how many agree with that tonight we just want to stay just as close as we can with the word we want to stay as close to the message of the hour as we can stay because god did not call me to bring a message and i don't want to put that burden on myself or put that burden on you god called a prophet in this day a prophet in this day one messenger to bring a message to the age now we can take scriptures and quotes and fight one another with it we can become extremists who fight with other extremists right in the other ditch right and i've preached on some of these things before but i just wanted it was on my heart tonight i just wanted to kind of deal with it as i was going to be going over the weekend now it's a serious issue though it's not say well it doesn't really matter but it does matter because our children are watching and they have to deal with the effects of our fights of our of our fusses of our of our constant aggravations on one another they deal with that and and what happens many times is when you're a legalist and you just bear with me tonight but when you're illegal it's what happens is you put yourself in a in a trap you actually trap yourself because what you've done is you've presented a gospel that has to be lived a certain way and your children can see past that and they can say well you don't fit this part of the scripture your life fails in this way and yet in this one thing you've made a legalistic doctrine out of it and maybe you won't have a christmas tree but you'll you'll do everything else you'll scream and holler and get angry and all these things and and do things you shouldn't do well everybody makes mistakes right but what you do by becoming legalistic on one point say well then people can't be saved if they do that when you do that you've actually backed yourself into a trap right because your children look at that and say well you did things that were wrong aren't you glad for the grace of god aren't you glad for the mercy of almighty god and many times good brothers and sisters do that and and i preached to you when i first came here or a few months after about how we shouldn't demonize the person we should always look at we don't want to become what we hate right we should always we should always leave for the personal matter out of it and just try to stay with the word and and not demonize people because a person can be wrong and yet be a child of god a person even a preacher can be wrong at times and still be a child of god still be a son of god still be a man of god and if we're not careful we we build up so many things and destroy so many people by our actions by our words that we end up with no one that our children can have any confidence in at all and what's going to happen in the future if they grow up and there's no one alive that's right you see the problem with me being the last minister that's correct is that what are my children going to do if the lord tarries do i have to anoint the next one like they do in some groups that's not how god works somebody out there has got it right and probably more right than me are you with me now because it wasn't up to me i didn't bring the message the message come to the age but branham said i was just reading the history of martin luther and one of his books was wrote on him here not long ago they said it wasn't so mysterious that martin luther could protest the catholic church and get by with him but to hold his head above all the fanaticism that followed his revival he said as that there goes there's a mixed multitude with every revival you know that he said but now remember that only indicates that there's a real one when you see a bogus dollar or somebody's making out like they got something just remember there's one genuine kids remember that young people young couple remember that if you see a bogus dollar don't get discouraged there's a real one somewhere you see somebody that don't live it don't get discouraged there's a real one somewhere but remember even good genuine articles make mistakes we don't we cannot live the law that's why we have grace and we are supposed to live a life worthy of the gospel but we only do that by the holy spirit we can't do that by our own effort now so he said that original so you know that can't be the original so there has to be an original he said and that original is the real jesus christ he said the one that's here that knows every secret in your heart right now aren't you glad for the original one amen what is balance is maintaining your position in the middle of truth not between the two extremes and it's a mistaken idea and i've probably said it before but people say well i'm going to be in the middle of the road between the liberal and the conservative between no the balance is in the middle of the word the middle of the scripture says brother branham put it we want to stay in the middle of the bible in other words we want to be able to run what we believe all the way through the scriptures all the way through the message not just take one quote here or one there not just take one scripture here but to take the whole thing we're not offended by any quote we're not offended by any a man could stand here and preach the word to us so we'd say amen and another man come preach another side of it we could say amen we're not offended by it because what is it it's a it's the middle of truth right and and we have to present that now brother brown said we pray he's praying for pastors and officers of the church he said we pray that he'll give these men understanding we need understanding tonight not only as a pastor but also the officers of the church he's praying for trustees and deacons he said we pray he'll give these men understanding that they'll never get off on the wrong side but stay right straight in the middle of the road with it never be exalted or anything whenever you do you're finished right there just stay humble with it when you handle the word with humility it's a whole lot easier to stay in the middle of the road it's hard to keep your balance when your head is swollen when your ego is swollen when you feel like you're the only one that's got it right it's hard to keep your balance paul put it this way in second timothy 2 15 study that word is to work to be diligent to show yourself approved unto god a workman that needeth not to be ashamed rightly dividing the word of truth and we've dealt with that before how that's proportioning the word to the age to the correct age that we're in now if we if we want to do a service for god and all of us want to anyone do a service for god we should all want to and when we do that we've got to consider what we're doing and make sure that we're not just doing something because sometimes just doing something can get you in trouble that's where david he got in trouble even what he was doing was right but he did it in the wrong way so we want to consider what we're doing right not not just take it and and well these are quotes these are scriptures we'll do it no it's got to be under the leadership of the holy ghost and there's got to be some things in place first brother branham said there was five must he said it's got to be his time his season when he when he said it would be the man that he chose he said it must come to the prophet and the prophet must be a vindicated prophet so his time his season when he said it would be or his time is season that's when he said it would be the man that he chose must come to the prophet the prophet must be a vindicated prophet he said we find many of them in the bible he said it come to the prophets and it wasn't vindicated he said our prophet is jesus christ i like that we we know he's vindicated but we know we had a messenger in our day now brother branham uses the example of moses building an ark right if he had built an ark in his day it wouldn't have been the right season right it was in the word but it was only a light for a certain day right now he also used the example of jesus bringing the law he said jesus didn't have to go out there and and take ten commandments and tablets of stone and throw him on the ground why because he was the law right he was the fulfillment of the law and i think a lot of our balanced problems and again i'm speaking to us here tonight i think a lot of our problems with balance would be solved if we knew where we were at and what message we were listening to and again i think it's so important we understand the book has been open notice brother brown said the book written he said when this angel finishes all these loose end mysteries that through the battle they fought luther fought so there's always been a battle right there's always a battle for the middle of the road always always will be that's not a bad thing we want to know where the middle of the road is right we have to fight for that but it don't mean we have to we don't have to kill our brothers and sisters but we fight the devil right and so we fight a battle for the middle of the road he said the battle they fought luther fought wesley fought the pentecostals fought but there's coming one says the bible in the days of his sounding all these mysteries he said the oneness run off on jesus name the trinity went off on father son and holy ghost just like they did at the nicea council same thing they both was wrong but now in the middle of the road in the scriptures lays out the truth but you'll find this applies to every area and so then you can say it this way the balance is the message right the book wasn't open it they had an unbalanced luther had an unbalanced wesley had it unbalanced right but when the book come open it it was balanced right so the message is the balance oh i'm so glad for a message today and so now we should have a balance and that balance should extend not only to our doctrine but to our families to our home life to the way we do courtship and dating to the way we do the way we do christmas to the way we the way we treat one another are you with me the way husbands treat their wives and wives treat their husbands that balance should be there and it should extend into every area why because the message touches on all of those things and it brings it down it doesn't bring a new bible a new scripture but it opens it up and it balances it to where we can see what it is in our day are you with me now uh because here was somebody god had to call somebody who wouldn't balance the word according to his own prejudice are you hear me because if i had been called to do that or if i had done it i would have actually balanced it according to the prejudices i was raised up in but god had to call a kentucky hillbilly who didn't know anything he wasn't raised in church are you with me now and he revealed to him the truth what was it so he could have the right balance so we could have the right balance hope you hear me now now and i think in in saying that then in keeping our balance if we keep our focus on the message instead of on what everybody else is doing we would maintain our balance and i've had conversations with other ministers about that and i had one admit to me said you know he said when when i get my eyes off of the message i begin to get skewed one way or another but when i stay in the message when i keep when i stay with a prophet he said and feed off of that and take my my messages from the scriptures and from the and from the prophet and from the things that have been brought to us in our day he said i stay balanced and i thought well that's that's right because what we do is we get our eyes on what everybody else is doing and it caused us to to begin to tip over and begin to get a little maybe legalistic in this area or a little bit off in this area the pharisees thought they were doing a good thing they thought they were saving the world from the liberal sadducees all right they they thought they were they thought oh them sadducees they're so liberal they don't even believe in we we believe in a resurrection we believe in miracles they thought they were doing a good thing but they actually could not even recognize christ when he came because their tradition made the word of none effect now you know if you've been around for very long but j.t has been around a long time some of you other brothers have been around a long time and i won't say how long but harvey and and brother bill curtis some of you brother danny i you've been around along some of you young people have been around a long time brother alan you know it feels like we're being raised in this message sometimes that we've you know we've been around a long time and we're young men but but we've seen just about everything i know brother allen has and i have and and and we've seen uh thunder's movements and and we've seen uh we've seen uh uh people that were emotional and people that were unemotional and people that were people that were one way or another in different kinds of doctrines and we fought skirmishes over christmas trees and and battles over the seventh seal and wars over the son of man ministry and and and world wars over whether or not we should play tapes in church and and most of those have been put behind us and but but the battle is always there and again it's not necessarily a bad thing when you see that don't get discouraged but just try to find your balance in the message and in the scripture so we've seen all of that and we begin to put it behind us as as you begin to get older and you begin to realize that some things you some things are not as necessary as others and that word when jesus says he said the waiter matters that word is important the important things like love and faith and mercy and judgment important things right those things are important some things are not right and that's where a lot of the battle comes in now is what's important well again if we just stay in the message and be willing to surrender ourselves to all of it to the open book in our day i think we'd have a lot better balance but sometimes we we let our prejudices come in and if we're a person that likes a certain thing we we want to find a quote to to like it you know and for a person that don't like a certain thing we want to find a quote to dislike it and chances are over time you will because a prophet in balancing this message he'd bring one side and he'd bring the other and and he'd preach different things at different times to different people he wasn't being being disreputable or lying to people what was he doing balancing it out and you've got to take the whole thing right not just part of it now these things are necessary you got to work to keep your balance if you're walking a tightrope you're not standing up there just running along it some people might but if you're walking a tightrope over the grand canyon you're going to be working at it constantly moving to keep your balance and that's what we want to do now but we have to have some absolute right because if there's not anything that's correct how can we ever if there's no median if there's no balance point how can we ever keep a balance right there's got to be a balance point there's got to be something where we can come in agreement on the major things is when we realize that the balance point is the message of the hour it has to be and when we talk about the message i know there's been a lot of over the years back and forth on that is the message the absolute is the bible the absolute well the bible if we could say it that way it's not this book that's the absolute the absolute is what god says right but what god says is written down in the bible right right this is what god says so we can say this is our absolute but the message of the hour when we understand the message to be the light on that book it's not anything different right so when we come to an absolute of balance we come to the message of the hour because there's got to be something that's balanced something's got to be right and it's not going to be the way i have church or the way somebody else does or or the way so and so down the street or or even the most famous preacher in the message you know as much as i love and appreciate all of them that's not my balance right because there may be something different that they're called to than what i'm called to but i've got to preach to you and i've got to be called to you and so there's got to be a balance what is it the message of the hour this word revealed for our day right now it's the revealed word now if there's nothing to agree on see the nominal church fights the same battles we do sure many times right now there's a great battle going on in the church in the nominal church it's the same one we're fighting among the baptists and the reformed and some of those people they're the same battles going on out there and you think how how could that be well it's because it's because the spirit is in the land the same spirits are in the land but if you watch those people if you watch it they've got nothing to come back to and so they end up dividing we ought to have something to come back to and whenever you see somebody leave and go off by themselves and it's us foreign no more they never did find a balance right and usually it's because there was nothing to balance too because they've taken the word of a man over the message of the hour we don't even take brother branham's word for it if we can say it like that it's the word of god right but brother branham happened to be the mouthpiece that god used in our day right so we're not taking the word of a man brother brandon said you're not feeding on the words of a man you're feeding on the body word of the son of man so we're not just taking a man's word for it we're we're staying with the scriptures and then when we find balance like that when something i try to do when i come and preach something is i try to run it all the way through are you still with me tonight i don't want to lose you but i try to run it all the way through the message and all the way through the scriptures and if i find something disagrees with it i put it on the shelf until i understand it because sometimes you realize well brother random had a progressive revelation and here he says it differently than he did back there and sometimes that's the case sometimes that's not sometimes he's given different views of the same thing and and other times even in the scriptures brother brown said you take the scripture and say yes and say judas hanged himself you go do the same if you take two scriptures and put them together without any context right so we've got to be careful with that but god called a prophet to come now we've got to take someone's word for it in paul's day he said if any man think himself to be a prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge that the things that i write unto you are the commandments of the lord now he writes this after the great battle they had in corinthians about women's hair and about the gifts and all those things he said let them acknowledge they're going to be people that say it don't matter if a woman cuts their hair but he said let him acknowledge what i write unto you is the commandment of the lord yes that's right right moses did the same thing in deuteronomy 4 2. he said you shall not add to the word which i command you neither shall you diminish ought from it or he said don't fence it in an effort to protect it don't do it but the jews have thousands you know there's there's only there's ten commandments and then the jews have a certain number of laws i forget how many there are but it's a finite number but the the number of explanations is infinite the number of things they've added to it is infinite they don't even know what being a good jew is it depends on which teacher you follow oh god help us not to be that way we need to stay with what god said and if it's something that that can't be clearly taught or clearly seen in the message now if you want to live by that i say go ahead because you don't want to violate your conscience if you want to live by that you don't want to do certain things there's certain things that you see in in the message and maybe i don't see it that's fine you go ahead don't don't violate your conscience but don't take away another brother's liberty either if it's something that's not clear so he said you won't don't diminish all right from it that you may keep the commandments of the lord your god which i command you but the branham said this was moses speaking to israel after he had been vindicated by god by a pillar of fire and knew he was proved to be god's servant to lead them out and before they went into the land before they entered moses said now the words that i've spoken to you he said i call heaven and earth to witness against you if you add one thing to it take one word from it you'll not stay in the land where the lord gives you he said so say i in the name of jesus christ don't you add one thing don't take put your own ideas in it you just say what it said on those tapes you just do exactly what the lord god has commanded to do don't add to it see the reason why i don't believe that the thunders are the virtues which is the thunders doctrine that we talk about they thought the thunders were the virtues and the reason why i don't believe the thunders are the virtues is because brother branham never said it right i mean just ultimately you could prove by the scripture and different things but ultimately he just never said it right so you could have a great idea and come up with a great theory but if you didn't say it i'm gonna have a hard time making doctrine out of it right and so that's the reason i don't believe that the reason i don't believe uh in uh uh press play it's because brother branham never said it now i believe you can press play that's fine if you still have a tape player or however it is that you that you listen i want you to listen to the message we ought to be digging into it today more than ever before and i'm glad that many of you do but when they say press play and obey brother branham didn't say it he never said it go look it up he never said the words press play never did that's been added to it and but we could you know we we understand that but there's many things that if we're not careful we've added things that brother branham didn't actually say and again there's some things that are revealed and you've got to be careful because you're going to say well brother branham didn't say that but there's some things that are there i'll give you a good example in the scripture it's the rapture the word rapture is not in the bible right but the caught up is in the scriptures and that could be translated rapture but if you take the king james version of the bible and say well the rapture is not in the bible i can't use the word rapture but why do we know the rapture that's a good word to use brother branham used it so when god sent a prophet on this age to open up the seals i'm just a simple man when god sent a prophet to open up the book or the lamb opened the book and sent it to the prophet and to open it up to us right then what happened when the book was open we got to see what god would call it are you hearing me and so it would be permissible for us to do that so we're not adding to by doing that we're we've got the idea of what he's saying so now he said don't put your own ideas to it he said he has ever keeps his promise to us every promise he has made he's kept it could you say amen to that tonight i believe we could rejoice over that he's always kept his word oh as i get brother harvey i'm not very old but as i get older i begin to want to point people back to the scripture and back to the word and say he keeps his promises he keeps his promises if you'll just follow the word he keeps his word don't you don't have to get off on one side or the other and get discouraged and get down and the press say well i'm the only one that believes it no he keeps his word he ever keeps his promise to us every promise that he's made he's kept it as he told you what would happen and did it happen he said i bring heavens and earth before you today in a challenge has god ever said anything that he has not fulfilled and done exactly what he said he would do for us hadn't he done it just the way he said he would do it he said that's exactly so will he continue to do it that's why we want to stay with this prophet that's why we want to stay with this message that's why we want to say with this open book because what he promised he's fulfilling he's doing what he said you hear me tonight he said don't ad just don't add to it don't take from it just believe it and walk humble before the lord your god for we're nearing the going into the land again people might say well the best way to to not add to it is just by having no preachers but that is literally adding to it right just he says do what you've been commanded to do right now i've presented people with things the prophet said and at times and the response was well i know you have quotes as if that didn't matter right and he said well i have other quotes well yeah but these matter too right it's like saying well i know you have scripture for that but i have other scriptures and that's the way the denominations handle baptism brother branham didn't handle it that way it had to both be right and and again there's a progressive revelation in the message i understand that there's some things that you don't have to try to pull 19 some things by the random taught in 1947 through 1965 because he learned it as he went along because brother branham was human so i understand that but when it comes to the prophet he was always a prophet when he said it and so it's not a big deal to me if you bring me a quote from 1962 and i've got one from 1964 i'm okay with that i believe all of it that may be too simple for some people he said well but but but you're saying brother brandon didn't make any mistakes no because he said he did right but sometime we just got to quit trying to mess this thing up it's like god's given us this great gift in this age you know what a gift this message is to us it's a great gift and here we are we're going overseas and we're trying to get other people and and here's these people in egypt they don't have this gift that we have of the message of the hour in a form that we can listen to we can read it they don't have that and so they they struggle and with different things with how to dress and how to act and how to have church and all we shouldn't have to struggle with that cause we've got it right but but they struggle with that but they don't have that gift but we have no excuse we do have it but it's a gift why why do we try so hard to mess it up it's true god gave us pastors for a reason he sent us a prophet for a reason he gives us a church to go to for a reason he put us in a position we're in in the place we're in i've watched god supernaturally work in this church over the last couple of years i don't have much confidence in my own ability as a minister as a pastor but i do have confidence in what god has done here over the last two years and i say thank god for that he said brother ben i don't see a lot of the fruits of it i do i see the lives of people and i see how we're progressing and maturing and i see people coming and being a part and and sometimes you work for years we don't want to do things overnight a church that comes overnight comes easy will leave overnight but we want to see people built up in the faith and then if they move on somewhere else god bless them let's build someone else up let's build our children up let's build our young people up let's get them into the message of the hour what did the prophet say what what does the bible say and even when they're very young we try to teach them the scriptures because what did the scripture say about it you can find out when you have a question to go back to the word and then when you come old enough you understand the message you can go and run the message right through the scripture and it'll all add up [Music] now but it's like well you have quotes it's like that's not a big deal and we we should respect all of it not just the parts that are whoever we listen to or even myself if i'm the your favorite preacher praise god i'm probably not any of your favorite preacher but if i am if i am then then don't don't just listen to what i say because i said it and take it for gospel line it up with the word and so but each pastor has the right to preach what his church will listen to and it's on you right it's on you to come back to me and tell me if i did it if i preached it wrong i understand i'll make mistakes and say things you don't have to come and tell me every every little thing like i do for brother joel i'll take care of that but but uh but but but as far as it's the the doctrine and things that we teach if it's wrong come and tell me maybe we can come to an understanding of it you you got a responsibility for what you listen to it's too late of an hour to be listening just anything and so but we every church is sovereign in that way all of us the messenger to the age came brought the word the word is here christ the word present in our day right the messenger is gone the word is here every other minister stands under that word uh even brother joel i'm his pastor but he stands under that word i can't tell him what to preach i can give him hints but i can teach him i can't tell him what to preach i can't tell by the alan what to preach right because they stand under that message under that messenger every church especially every every local church and every pastor has his own uh his own ability to get into the word and to find out what a prophet said romans 14 and 4 says who art thou that judges to another man's servant do his own mastery standeth their falleth yeah he shall be holding up for god is able to make him stand now again like i said we could go in several different directions tonight but i just want to show you an an example if i could just for a few minutes then we'll go and and we'll you just be patient with me just for a minute i gave myself five more minutes on my clock i gave myself 50 minutes instead of 45 tonight and then i forgot to turn it on so but we'll be okay now i'll stop when it's time to stop now even in the early church now think about it not all the early church was in the same place spiritually not all the early churches were in the same place there was a church in corinth that was so different from the church in ephesians but they were god's church you don't want to forget that when you read corinthians because sometimes the way paul talks to them you might forget that they were even christians but they were god's church he said to the to the sanctified to the called out to the elect the galatians were in a certain place the ephesians were in a certain place the corinthians were in a certain place all of them dealing with different things and paul writes very different letters to different churches and yet it all ties together and so every church is affected by its history its culture its location its pastors and brother brown said even its name i think i read that quote to you sunday he talked about how a church even is affected by the name it has and so there's a lot of little things that go into bringing and making a church what it is we are very different even churches in the same area can't be lumped together and i get a little aggravated when people do because obviously i think we're the best but then other pastors might get aggravated too and they lump us with them because we ought to feel that way and so we're very different and let me say something that might shock you god wants it that way he don't want cookie-cutter denominational churches and denominational congregations where everybody does it the way headquarters says to do it that's what not what god wants he's a god of variety and and you might say well why don't we just do it the way this other church does it's successful for them it might not be successful for us and we're not responsible for them what if they're wrong our standard again the balance point is the word and yet we should not use our differences even if we feel someone else is out of balance to destroy one another and and again the pharisees they use their traditions for that purpose it's okay to have tradition the pharisees problem was they elevated their tradition to word status let's go to matthew 23 and look at it for just a moment and i'll have to quit for him through matthew 23 then spake jesus to the multitude and to his disciples saying the scribes and the pharisees sit in moses seed all therefore whatsoever they bid you observe that observe and do in other words they're in a seat of authority they understand the law but do not ye after their works what an indictment for they say and do not again this is where trying to build fences extra fences around what we know and what has been revealed gets you in trouble and brings you into a trap because you can't live it because the holy spirit won't help you and i preached to you about that before the holy spirit will not help you in your legalism and you'll find yourself defeated and down and depressed because the holy spirit's not going to help you live that he only helps you live the word now so he said don't don't do after their works for they say and do not for they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be born and lay them on men's shoulders but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers heavy burdens and so the problem with legalism again one of the problems with it is that it forces you to make allowances for your own particular brand of sin that may sound kind of harsh but it's you know we we all make mistakes and so it forces you to make allowances for your own but no allowance for anyone else and jesus gives us several examples of that we'll take one he said well until you blind guides which say whosoever shall swear by the temple and it's nothing but whosoever shall swear but the gold of the temple he's a deader because they wanted something to make an oath by so they said well the temple is nothing but boy if they swear by the gold we'll put them out of the church and and jesus said you fools and blind whether it's greater the gold or the temple that sanctifieth the gold you're not even thinking it doesn't make sense and they made allowances for themselves they were pros at this i i've heard that they would actually on the sabbath they couldn't walk only a certain distance from their home on the sabbath so what they would do is they would take articles of clothing they would have a servant who wasn't a jew go out and and run ahead of them and drop an article of clothing or something that belonged to them so every so far however far they could go on the sabbath because they consider that their home the teacher interpreted that to be their home so then they could feel righteous and go as far as they wanted to on the sabbath right legalism is a strange bird and it make you one me one and matthew 15 1 he deals with one of these traditions then came to jesus scribes and pharisees which of jerusalem saying why did thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders for they wash not their hands when they eat bread and these guys were like the mask people today you know people and i know if you want to wear a mask that's that's fine but some people go we were in walmart one day and after the mask man they'd been lifted and this woman man she was determined we would wear one if we were going to be around her we were like well we don't have to be around you you can move on but she was just determined and i if i remember correctly we put one on because we weren't going to make a fuss but but you know it was they were like that with this they're like we wash our hands why don't your disciples wash their hands well the truth is it would have been a good thing for the disciples to wash their hands don't you think so you imagine the dirt and the grime the disciples walking through the cornfield just picking corn and eating it and we've been in that kind of a country where they walk where they with the animal uh dung and stuff on the roads and you it's just nasty some of our clothes went in the trash because it's just nasty constantly and washing feet would have been a whole nother experience and and so but that's the kind of country they lived in so it had been a good thing it wasn't a bad thing to wash your hands but they elevated it to doctrine and when they elevate it to doctrine you know how you know when someone elevates something to doctrine they say if you don't do it you'll end up in hell and they've elevated it to doctrine they said it's weighty it matters and jesus said you didn't have to leave the other undone but you should have focused on the weightier matters of the law he said he said the tradition of the elders they washed off their hands when they read but he answered and said unto them why do you also transgress the commandment of god by your tradition and he gives the example of honoring parents which i've given to you before how that they would give a gift to their parents they basically give them a bribe say now i've honored my parents i don't ever have to see you again i think some kids are like that today that's basically what they did stuck them in a nursing home paid for the nursing home and said okay it's yours it's gone and again sometimes i realize that has to happen but but it's just uh just as an example they've tried to pay them off that's not honoring our parents and he used that example and then he said you hypocrites well did isaiah prophesy of you saying this people draw nine to me with their mouth and honor me with their lips but their heart is far from me but in vain they do worship me teaching for doctrines the commandments of men washing hands it's a good thing but you don't teach it for doctrine are you with me god bless all you that wash your hands praise god don't just don't make a doctrine out of it they made their personal preferences doctrine and doctrine isn't something you play with like that because it's life you understand the word is life to us some of you know that the word is life we must have the balance in the word that brings life so we find things again and i'll just use this one example you know our services cause controversy because of how we have church and how emotional one church is and one is not and i've been working i think i could i could get by for the next year or maybe the next 10 years without preaching against emotionalism because y'all aren't greatly emotional but we've come a long ways and and maybe there'll be a time i have to come out and settle things down that day has not arrived yet but there may come a time when i'd have to do that why because we believe in all of it right but but you got to be careful with that because if we're not careful all we do is just take quotes at each other and fight one another with it when brother branham said both things you know i think most of us could agree that preaching should always take precedence in a service somebody could say amen to that we love music but the preaching should take precedence in that some some will tell you only old songs bring the presence of the lord some will say only new some say only fast song some say only slow i know there's some of you and i won't look at you but some of you folks would love it if we sang old hymns every song that we've sang and i would be right there with you just being honest with you i love it i also like some new songs but some of you would love only to have old songs and others of you would love to have only new songs i won't look at you either you know who you are i'll look at you out on the stream tonight but you know why can't we have both again and judge the song on its own merits if it's rock and roll it doesn't belong in the church right that's simple enough and uh you know but i'm not going to throw out the baby with the bathwater elvis sang amazing grapes i'm not going to quit singing it because of that it's just silly and but brother branham you know you find your quotes and here's a quote it's going to sting a little bit brother brown said but today we say everybody have a big time everybody clap their hands we like to do that don't we everybody holler hallelujah everybody do this he said oh how we got a bunch of fuss he said we get these new songs out and seeing them so fast it looks like we're going to run through the wall with them or something like that he said when i think if we'd be singing nearer my god to thee would be a whole lot better for the church the old-fashioned hymns boy some of you feel good right now you know brother ben's on my side oh that's a quote that brother brother said that amen the same prophet said oh my he said don't you feel good think friends this is pentecost worship this is pentecost let's clap our hands and sing it pentecostal people everybody he said now loosen up get that old methodist formality out of you now same prophet preached in the same church both sermons preached in the tabernacle and so now again he says it kind of gets on both here he says he says now may god bless this little group here that gathers and just keep having these breakfasts and above everything else keep it spiritual he said never let that spirit die sing those old-fashioned songs and clap your hands praise the lord he said that's the way you got to keep he said i'm a southerner it's the same quote i'm emotional he said i can prove to you anything without emotion is dead he said and if your religion hasn't got a little emotion in it you better bury it and get one that has it's dead he said so we got to have emotions jesus said if they hold their peace the rocks will immediately cry out sure he said well how could a prophet say both of those things well we're going to take a little bit farther you see sometimes it's not appropriate to sing nearer my god to thee do you know that that's a good song but there's times that's not appropriate brother brown talked about paul rayder he said he was dying and the moody bible school sent down a quartet he said they were standing there with the shades all down in the hospital singing near my god to thee and paul raised up and said hey who's dying me or you he said raise them shades and sing me some good snappy gospel songs there's a time and a place for both aren't you glad god sent a prophet and again brother brown said there is also just people who live upon the emotion some people say well we got a lot of that in our pentecostal movement he said and they will go in which is fine they'll pat their hands and play the music but random claps his hands music stops shoo a bucket of water went over everything he said now we do that he said we got in the habit of doing that he said it's just become one of our customs let me tell you something when you're worshiping god in the spirit and in truth when it becomes a custom for you to do it because you think you ought to do it because you think if you don't shout or jump up and down or dance with the music your neighbor is going to think you're backslid you're drinking from a stagnated stream and even preachers will get into that at times you know we all get in each other's spirits you know and and do the same things but we ought to do it because of the love of god in our hearts not because we think somebody's going to look down on us because we didn't shout that service maybe you didn't feel like shouting maybe you felt like crying but there's some response that you add to the word of god that's what we want to see it's a response when i talk about a church being alive i'm not talking about about having a great big band and strobe lights and people jumping up and down i'm talking about response and life and movement so when the word is preached there's a there's a reality to it it's not just some dead cold formal thing right now and so he said your neighbor is going to take your backseat he said until until it fills every fiber until the holy spirit itself bubbling in you he said i don't care whether the music is playing whether they're playing near my god to thee or whatever it is the holy spirit is still ringing the glory bells in your heart that satisfies that's god's satisfying portion anything less than that you're done we want the real thing don't we yes why can't we have one service that's solemn with an altar call another where people are rejoicing another when the gifts are operating another where we are encouraged and brother branham brings it all kind of together and god hiding himself in simplicity he said he said there's one side that's highly intellectual cold and indifferent they deny everything there the others get on the other side on the other side with a radical bunch of an emotion and deny the word the key is not the emotion but denying the word both of them deny the word right one denies everything one denies takes the emotion but denies the word but the real true church stays right in the middle of the road he said now if you notice it's got the bible knowledge of what god said and it's spiritual enough to be warm in its heart and it's just the road oh isn't that the road you want to be on tonight amen even if you're singing near my god to thee i don't even know if we know how to play it but if if you're singing near my god to thee it's a great old hymn but even if you're seeing that there ought to be joy bells in your heart but again like i said there's sometimes it's not appropriate sometimes we need to clap our hands sometimes we need to get up when you're feeling down brandon said you'll begin to patch your foot with the music and we've read all those quotes before and then david said praise the lord with the symbols praise him with the dance and that's biblical stuff yeah sure but there's times you don't need that there's times you need to sit there and cry and there's some people who don't do much of any of that one of these days i'm going to see by the levi nod i'm going to run all over this church but i've been preaching levi since he was six years old so i i understand some people just don't move much but let there be a response in your heart let it come where you where you know it's been preached and the best response is to live it right that's the best response lord help us to be spiritual enough to respond to the word and again what should be our litmus test well can we say amen to all of it or do we just dis-fellowship people who disagree with us or do it a little bit differently maybe god called their church to be runners of the isles runners on the backs of the pew some of you if you run on the back of your break a hip i would too maybe god hasn't called us to that but we can be warm in our heart let's be that let's be that with all that we have and when god when a revival spirit does come through let's not stifle it let's give it the freedom to operate it let god be able to do what god does can you say amen to all of it or do you try to explain it away based on your prejudice all right i want you to look at brother branham sermon titles as we close this is the odd sermon i know i want you to look at brother branham sermon titles i've already taken too much time this is between the seals into the seals and crisis of mystery now this had been me brother danny i would have preached the seventh steel part 1 through 100 during this time i'm honest with you brother branham didn't do that because you know generally when you're a preacher you get that good one with alan you want to keep keep going with it right so you just keep explaining it keep explaining keep explaining brother doesn't do that he goes on the field for a while he preaches the world is falling apart god hiding himself in simplicity victory day look come follow me aren't those great titles jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever he preaches that twice preaches a greater than solomon is here twice show us the father be not afraid conferences standing in the gap that's the first sermon he preaches when he gets back to jeffersonville the flashing red light of the sign of his coming completely different it seems like from the seals but it's all the opening of the word why there's a sermon you go back and listen to why oh lord just once more the third exodus see they drop that that magnificent sermon just full of the of the deep things of the word of god and then preaches is your life worthy of the gospel the indictment communion why christ speak humble thyself a prisoner he cares do you care god doesn't call a man to judgment without first warning him and wraps it up with christ as the mystery of god revealed now think about that just for a minute i don't say we all have to do it like that i can't i'm not creative enough to title my sermons like brother branham did plus he already used all those titles but that's balance let's quit trying to hatch out preachers and churches in our own image let's see what god will do see god is not a god of one thought turn to psalm chapter 40. we'll close god is not a god of one thought he said many o lord my god are thy wonderful works which thou hast done and thy thoughts plural which are to us word they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee if i would declare and speak of them they are more than can be numbered he said sacrifice an offering thou does not desire so god said i want to give you my thoughts realize that's what it was in our day god thought it he had some thoughts he wanted to express how could he do that a prophet had to come in our day and bring us the thoughts of god are you with me the commentary that god had when he spoke the word this is the word of god but he wanted us to know his thoughts and we are his thoughts right but now he says you didn't want burnt offerings but he said mine ears has to have opened psalm 47 then said i lo i come now speaking of christ said in the volume of the book the volume the whole thing it is written to me i've got lots of thoughts god says aren't you glad he does lots of different thoughts lots of things but they all tie together i got lots of different people lots of different preachers lots of different churches but they all tie together lots of thoughts but in the volume of the book it is written to me this bride's the story of this bride is not just written in hardy it's written in egypt it's written in africa it's written in tennessee it's written in in missouri it's written all over the place it's god's thoughts many kinds of thoughts and i think we should come down to verse 8 i delight to do thy will oh my god whatever thoughts you want me to express to hear and to express let me hear that yea thy law is within my heart musicians go ahead and come i could preach that a hundred times make 100 parts out of it but we'll leave it rest there for now i've told you the story before but i read where the devil was walking along with one of his courts okay joel i didn't go too long devil was walking along with one of his cohorts i caught him looking at his watch he saw a man ahead of him pick up something shiny and the demon asked the devil he said what'd he pick up he said always a piece of the truth and demon said well aren't you worried he said no he'll make a religion out of it you know what we do god help us not to do that with the message we want all of the truth oh and the volume of the book is written to me let me be a manifestation of all of your word lord don't let me deny any of it let me be all of it let me let me let the word make me a well-rounded individual i believe the word will make you a better citizen it'll make you better on facebook or off of it it'll make you better in church it'll make you a better husband a better wife amen in the balance of it it'll change your life why don't we just let it do that for us tonight bow your heads with me if you would we don't want to just make a religion out of truth we want to live the word heavenly father lord as i come tonight and these people that have set patiently on a wednesday night while i just preach what was on my heart and i pray there wasn't error in it lord or humanity that crept in i know it's possible i know it happens sometimes and i pray you'd help them to spit aside any seeds and just take what's true or may we all learn to do that not to discount the vessel because of the mistakes the lord to recognize that you use messengers to bring your word we had one messenger to the age and we thank you for that today we have many preachers many ministers many pastors a fivefold ministry to to preach that word but they'll make many mistakes but lord yet you'll be with them and we're so thankful for that because it's your word to have it i pray god that you'd move in a mighty way in this church lord that we would never stifle the move of the spirit but that we would not be lord addicted to the candy of of running and shouting but lord that when it comes lord it would be natural it would be something that just flows oh god may it be so but lord and sometimes maybe in the quietness of the moment in the teaching lord as we hear your word and we grow in that too lord in the valleys help us to get strong so we can climb the mountains and stand in victory lord and know what you've done for us in this hour i pray you continue to or bring revival to us continue work lord in a mighty way touch every heart bless these young people lord that lord that are fixing to get married i pray you just you'd help them lord that you'd all of their life that you'd keep them in the place where they ought to be lord i pray for our church and or those that we might have come in contact with may you help us to be a light and a witness lord lord for the deacons and the trustees whether i'm here or not lord may the church continue to be a light be lord in my absence order in the absence of any other person may the ones who are gathered together in this place be a light and a witness and a testimony of what a message church ought to be what a bride group ought to be i pray you granted that keep us
