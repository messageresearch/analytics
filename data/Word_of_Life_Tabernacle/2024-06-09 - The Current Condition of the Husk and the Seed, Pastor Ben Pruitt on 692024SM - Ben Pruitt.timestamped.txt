[43:11] tears and bind them in bundles to burn
[43:14] them but gather the wheat into my barn
[43:18] aren't you glad to be wheat today amen
[43:20] God bless you could be
[43:26] seated brother brandom uses the terms
[43:29] husk shuck and also tears which is a
[43:32] different
[43:33] type he uses that term to describe the
[43:36] same group of
[43:38] people and it's what the the group of
[43:40] people he's describing is the third
[43:42] stage of the wheat it's leot in church
[43:45] it was the Pentecostal move it was a
[43:48] move of God the life of God come up
[43:50] through uh justification come up through
[43:53] sanctification come through the
[43:55] restoration of the gifts and then come
[43:58] into its full strength the word itself
[44:01] back again and so uh we know that uh we
[44:05] don't reject justification aren't you
[44:07] glad for justification today aren't you
[44:10] glad he took your sins and put them
[44:12] under the the Sea of of his
[44:13] forgetfulness we we don't do away with
[44:16] that we believe in that we believe that
[44:18] he justifies freely and we still believe
[44:21] that he saves us from our sins but yet
[44:23] we have a more perfect understanding of
[44:26] what that is in this age even than
[44:28] Luther had even though he was the one
[44:31] who brought that message and we
[44:34] understand that because we've heard a
[44:35] message called invisible Union of the
[44:37] bride and bridegroom and he told us what
[44:39] that was so uh we we we know that we
[44:42] know sanctification we know what that is
[44:44] and aren't you glad for sanctification
[44:47] aren aren't you glad there's a power of
[44:49] God that can move you away from the
[44:51] things of the world and take out the
[44:53] desire of sin and make you to where you
[44:56] live a holy life and I'm so glad that
[44:58] Holiness is still the order of the day
[45:01] without Holiness the Bible says the no
[45:03] man shall see the Lord and so we we
[45:05] still believe in Holiness today uh we
[45:08] still believe in the restoration of the
[45:10] gifts we still believe and we want the
[45:13] gifts to be among us and we believe they
[45:15] are and and maybe it wouldn't operate in
[45:17] a way that would you you would see or or
[45:20] in a way that would be a a showy time
[45:22] type of thing but that it would operate
[45:24] among the church in the way that God
[45:26] would want to he's Sovereign in that in
[45:29] doing that and we want to let him do
[45:31] that in his own time but we believe in
[45:33] the restoration of the gifts we believe
[45:35] in joy we believe in shouting we we
[45:37] believe in speaking in tongues we
[45:39] believe in the Holy Ghost we believe in
[45:41] those
[45:42] things and yet we know that we've moved
[45:45] on from that age of the restoration of
[45:47] the gifts and we've come to a place
[45:50] where the full strength of the word is
[45:53] upon us the sun is out in its fullness
[45:56] it is it is exactly the place where we
[45:59] can now see him as he is and it has been
[46:02] declared to us in this agees brother
[46:04] Stewart preached Wednesday night it's
[46:06] been declared he's here he is here who
[46:09] is here Christ the word is here and if
[46:12] he is here anything is possible and
[46:15] we've been shown that the sign of the
[46:16] son of man has come and we've been shown
[46:19] that Christ is here and this age so we
[46:23] are not dead but we're living the all
[46:25] the other ages as the life passed
[46:27] through them and went on they died the
[46:30] the all up to the husk they died and the
[46:33] husk died but the seed is still alive
[46:35] it's the only thing that's
[46:38] alive is the
[46:40] seed
[46:41] now we know that the husk is looks the
[46:46] most like the seed as I said you know
[46:49] and the reverse is also true the seed
[46:51] looks the most like the husk of all of
[46:54] those things in fact at one point you
[46:57] couldn't even tell the difference
[46:59] between the two because the husk was
[47:02] actually Sheltering the wheat was
[47:04] actually protecting the wheat sending it
[47:06] around the world and all of those things
[47:09] but there'd come a time that uh the sun
[47:12] would come in such strength that the
[47:13] husk would begin to separate and it
[47:16] denominated and died and so we know that
[47:19] it would only be the husk not the not
[47:22] the stalk and not the the other parts of
[47:24] the wheat but only the husk would be
[47:27] that part or all you call it the tear
[47:30] the shuck that would what would be so
[47:32] close to the wheat to be deceptive
[47:34] Matthew
[47:35] 24:23 Jesus said then if any man shall
[47:38] say unto you Lo here is Christ or or
[47:40] there believe it not so he said for
[47:43] there shall arise false Christ and false
[47:46] prophets shall show great signs and
[47:47] wonders in so much that if it were
[47:50] possible they shall deceive the very
[47:51] elect brother random always ties that to
[47:54] a Pentecostal age right because it was
[47:57] so much like the real but it wasn't the
[47:59] real so brother B says watch nature and
[48:03] I'm going to read quite a bit this
[48:04] morning and I'll try brother Robert to
[48:06] stay with my notes but we may skip
[48:08] around a little bit but he said brother
[48:11] Brown said watch nature nature is God
[48:13] God working in nature it's all he can he
[48:16] said but from the Pentecostal Revival he
[48:18] said as they think was the seed it
[48:20] wasn't he said now watch but something
[48:22] come forth just like the seed he said
[48:25] now watch what Jesus said in Matthew
[48:27] 24:24 the two Spirits at the last days
[48:29] would be so close together it would
[48:31] deceive the elected if possible I'm so
[48:34] glad that if is there I'm so glad the
[48:36] elect can't be deceived but why can't we
[48:39] be deceived because of the message of
[48:40] the Hour come to make us where we were
[48:44] uh we were without deception now uh he
[48:47] he said now that stalking and because we
[48:49] have a seed on the inside that causes us
[48:51] to believe that message and not anything
[48:53] else now that stalk don't look nothing
[48:55] like a seed neither does the tsel look
[48:57] like a seed but notice not in Luther's
[48:59] day but in the last day the first thing
[49:02] he said there's wheat farmer sitting
[49:03] here the first thing comes forth on a
[49:04] wheat seed you almost think it was a
[49:06] seed what is it it's the husk it forms a
[49:09] little outside thing like to hold the
[49:12] seed so you couldn't even tell but from
[49:14] the naked eye which was which right you
[49:17] couldn't even look at it and see on the
[49:18] outside but the difference was on the
[49:21] inside of what it was so he said uh he
[49:25] said it forms a husk but the husk is not
[49:28] the seed no more than the tossel or the
[49:30] stalk was it's only a carrier of the
[49:32] life the corn of wheat he said St John
[49:35] 12 you see Jesus speaking the wheat
[49:37] after the tossle after Wesley puts forth
[49:39] the husk which is the foremost like the
[49:41] grain of anything else the husk is more
[49:43] like the grain is coming more like the
[49:45] grain all the time the one that went
[49:47] into the ground and then when it comes
[49:49] forth the stalk it's got life in it but
[49:50] it isn't the grain it comes forth the
[49:52] tossel the pollen it still isn't the
[49:54] grain then it comes forth the husk and
[49:56] it's just in the shape of the wheat just
[49:58] exactly like the grain of wheat but yet
[50:01] it isn't the wheat just exactly in the
[50:04] same shape
[50:06] perfectly so in the same shape as the
[50:09] wheat but it's not the wheat we want to
[50:11] be the real thing don't we I believe we
[50:13] are the real thing but what makes us the
[50:15] real thing what's the difference it's
[50:17] the word right we can receive the word
[50:20] and the Pentecost age could not receive
[50:22] the word the difference is not in our
[50:24] manner of service or anything like that
[50:26] we might have a service just like a
[50:28] Pentecostal church but that's not what
[50:30] makes the difference what makes the
[50:32] difference is the word so now he said
[50:35] the Pentecost has come out just like the
[50:36] wheat wood each one comes out from the
[50:38] other coming out from the other he said
[50:41] but they're only a carrier they go to
[50:42] denomination yeah now watch The Gospel
[50:45] is going to come through Luther through
[50:46] Wesley into Pentecost at the last days
[50:48] it'll deceive the very elect if it's
[50:50] possible the elect he said oh
[50:51] Pentecostal Brethren can't you see the
[50:54] wheat in its first beginning is just
[50:55] like to see but when it begins to form
[50:57] like the seed but it's the husk get
[50:59] denominated exactly the same thing they
[51:02] did in Luther he talked about Revelation
[51:04] 17 he said if the church has notice here
[51:06] the life that was in the stalk tsel all
[51:09] now ends up in the seed yeah the life
[51:11] that come out of the original seed come
[51:13] up through different processes three
[51:16] different processes and then turns back
[51:19] till its original condition yes I know
[51:22] I'm doing a lot of reading but just hang
[51:24] with me for a minute he said notice here
[51:26] the life that was in the husk and the
[51:28] stalk and the tossel in the husk all
[51:30] gathers in the seed and the life that
[51:33] was in the stalk went one one went to
[51:35] make the other justification made a way
[51:37] for sanctification sanctification made a
[51:40] way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[51:42] the baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way
[51:44] for the Holy Ghost itself to come right
[51:47] down in Perfection back to the word
[51:50] again to manifest
[51:52] itself so now the seed and and I want
[51:55] you to know it's manifest in time that's
[51:58] the time that we're living in we're not
[52:00] living in Prophecy time we're living in
[52:03] manifesting time we're not living in a
[52:06] time for another prophecy to be given of
[52:08] what's going to happen but we're living
[52:10] in a time when the prophecy has been
[52:13] given and we're living in the time where
[52:16] that prophecy is manifesting itself it's
[52:18] manifesting itself in the lives of these
[52:20] young people it's manifesting itself in
[52:22] the lives of in the life of Housewives
[52:24] it's manifesting itself in the Liv of of
[52:27] men and women who believe God's
[52:29] word and it's so simple that people look
[52:32] over it and they say well nothing's
[52:34] going on the church is just well it's
[52:36] not doing too good and it seemed like
[52:38] things are not going the way they should
[52:40] and it's so simple people just look
[52:41] right over the top of it but didn't he
[52:43] tell us that's exactly how it would be
[52:46] that the third pole would be so simple
[52:48] and it would be so hidden and it would
[52:50] be so that the people wouldn't see it it
[52:52] wouldn't be out here in a in a tent
[52:54] meeting somewhere where they got
[52:56] television cameras and everybody's
[52:57] watching and we're all watching it
[52:59] happen again no that age has passed
[53:01] we're living in a time when the change
[53:03] is taking place on the inside yes right
[53:07] are you with me now and the news media
[53:10] will never pick up on it you know you'll
[53:11] never get you'll never get a news story
[53:15] you how we look at the news headlines
[53:17] it'll never be a news story The Bride is
[53:19] coming to
[53:21] maturity right there were news stories
[53:23] from Brother brandom come on the Earth
[53:25] right yeah the former and the latter
[53:27] rain coming together that made the news
[53:29] yeah there won't be no news about the
[53:30] bride coming to maturity right and
[53:33] there's no headlines come on it it's
[53:35] hidden from the world but Jesus said I
[53:38] thank thee oh Father you've hid these
[53:39] things from the eyes of the wise and PR
[53:41] but revealed it to babes such as would
[53:44] learn so it won't be a headline
[53:46] somewhere it won't be a great man or a
[53:48] great ministry or even a group of men or
[53:51] a group of Ministries but it'll be
[53:53] people individuals who are becoming the
[53:56] word until finally they mature until the
[54:00] change of the body now oh my oh I trust
[54:04] that's you and I today every one of
[54:05] there's something happening inside of
[54:07] you if you could just believe that if
[54:09] you could just grab a hold of that and
[54:10] realize everything you have need of just
[54:12] feed on the word and there's something
[54:14] changing on the
[54:17] inside now you can't see a difference
[54:22] between the husk and the wheat now I was
[54:26] going to show you a picture of the husk
[54:27] and the wheat but I couldn't tell the
[54:30] difference between one or the
[54:32] other so you can't really tell the
[54:35] difference between the husk and the
[54:37] wheat but as the sun continues to shine
[54:41] its strength the wheat or the husk
[54:42] brother pulls away the husk pulls away
[54:47] now the wheat never pulls away there's a
[54:49] great lesson there uh you know there's a
[54:52] great lesson there we don't divide we
[54:54] don't form denominations form the groups
[54:56] and pull away from people we just preach
[54:59] the word right right and the husk pulls
[55:02] away yeah from the grain we just stay
[55:05] together get that much closer to each
[55:07] other but the husk pulls away and what
[55:10] happens is the reason it pulls away is
[55:13] because it cannot take the word in its
[55:16] fullness it's reached the full potential
[55:18] of what it
[55:20] is right it it it had a purpose yeah but
[55:24] brother B said once it pulls away and
[55:25] dies once it denominates it'll never
[55:28] serve God's purpose again but it did
[55:31] have a purpose but now it pulls away and
[55:34] when it pulls away it begins to reveal a
[55:37] little bit more the difference between
[55:40] the husk and the wheat now what are the
[55:45] differences that you see between the two
[55:48] and I I begin to think about this these
[55:49] are just some things that come to my
[55:51] mind as we begin to think now what
[55:54] happened to the husk the husk
[55:55] denominated
[55:57] right but the seed is
[56:00] free right now look the hus denominated
[56:03] they looks like they're all in the same
[56:05] Condition it's all in a dry condition
[56:08] yeah but the husk is in bondage that's
[56:11] all it will ever be is what it is right
[56:13] but the seed is free right to become the
[56:16] fullness of the original grain right
[56:19] right brother brother what happened to
[56:21] you Pentecost is a few years ago you
[56:22] come out of that messal denomination to
[56:24] make yourselves Pentecost what why did
[56:26] you want to go back in it again he said
[56:28] the husk had to come the grain wasn't
[56:31] here yet he said see notice that's just
[56:33] the way they did that was in their heart
[56:36] they had to do it it was in their heart
[56:38] to be denominational so they went back
[56:40] to denomination because they were only a
[56:42] husk but there's something in your heart
[56:45] for there's a cry for freedom in the
[56:46] heart of the Bride something that will
[56:48] not bow down to denominational ideas
[56:51] what is that that cry for freedom in the
[56:53] bride that me that you're born for
[56:55] something more more than the husk was
[56:58] yes sir so there's a cry for freedom in
[57:01] your heart he said there'll be brother
[57:03] said notice there will be no more
[57:04] carrier mother Church's denominations
[57:06] after this carrier Shu because after the
[57:09] Shu there's no more nothing left by then
[57:12] but just the grain is that right it's
[57:14] got to be the grain it's got to be the
[57:15] same kind that went into the ground
[57:18] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[57:19] and forever a spirit I love this come
[57:22] upon the bride to do the same things
[57:25] that he did y all right it's the
[57:27] reproducing again of the grain so it's
[57:31] not just to to be a church member it's
[57:33] not just to be a a good person but it's
[57:36] a reproducing again of the Life of
[57:38] Christ in your life whatever he did
[57:41] that's what we begin to do as a body
[57:43] that's what we do is what he did yes yes
[57:47] so we know that the word makes us free
[57:50] John 8:31 Jesus said to those Jews which
[57:53] believed on him if you continue in my
[57:55] word then You by disciples indeed you
[57:58] shall know the truth and the truth shall
[58:00] make you free yes and what that tells us
[58:02] is that a lie brings us into bondage
[58:05] Satan's lie takes you into bondage but
[58:08] God's truth makes you free yes and they
[58:11] answered him and said we be Abraham's
[58:12] seed we never in bondage to any man th
[58:14] sayest th you should be made free Jesus
[58:16] answered them verily verily say unto you
[58:18] whosoever committeth sin as the servant
[58:21] of the slave of sin and the servant
[58:23] abideth not in the house forever but the
[58:25] son abide hiest forever if the sun
[58:27] therefore shall make you free you shall
[58:30] be free indeed what's happening at the
[58:32] Harvest time the sun is making the wheat
[58:35] free GL to God that's why the Shu had to
[58:39] dry up that's why the stalk had to dry
[58:41] up that's why denomination had to be the
[58:43] in the condition they are it wasn't
[58:45] because God just said well the I'm going
[58:47] to mess around with these people they're
[58:48] going to think they got and they don't
[58:50] know they had to be that way to show who
[58:52] you are yeah all right there had to be a
[58:54] contrast there had to be a different
[58:56] they had to fade away to show who the
[58:58] wheat
[59:00] is so the sun makes us free yes and and
[59:05] and we realize today that that means
[59:07] that we have freedom the more light we
[59:09] have the more light we have the more
[59:11] freedom we have right there's a uh I
[59:15] think it's the Washington Post which is
[59:17] ironic considering that they're
[59:18] basically a liberal newspaper but the
[59:21] Washington Post has a a slogan democracy
[59:23] dies in
[59:25] darkness democracy dies in darkness and
[59:27] it's true that Liberty I'm ringing just
[59:30] a little bit it's true that Liberty
[59:33] actually dies when there's no freedom of
[59:37] of
[59:38] truth right and it's true today you look
[59:41] around you you many times you don't know
[59:43] what to believe yeah you look on
[59:45] Facebook it might be true it might not
[59:47] be true that's how many of you have
[59:49] paused before reposting something
[59:51] because you realize you weren't 100%
[59:53] sure that it was actually true at all
[59:57] some of y'all didn't pause you just went
[59:58] ahead you
[1:00:00] know but you've done that like you
[1:00:02] brother JT we look at something we think
[1:00:04] that must be true but we don't know how
[1:00:07] can we prove it because the people that
[1:00:09] tell us to have an agenda right yeah I
[1:00:12] don't want to make you paranoid I don't
[1:00:13] want to make you all like Jeremy this
[1:00:14] morning
[1:00:16] but
[1:00:18] on but you know you you begin to get
[1:00:20] that way cuz you don't know what to
[1:00:21] believe who's telling me the truth I'll
[1:00:24] tell you the only place you'll find
[1:00:25] truth truth and that's in the word of
[1:00:27] God all right come on this will make you
[1:00:28] free why because it's true it's always
[1:00:31] been true it always will be
[1:00:33] true but but but the news media will
[1:00:36] never make you free it'll always it'll
[1:00:38] always bind you because you don't know
[1:00:39] what to believe and what not to believe
[1:00:41] and so democracy dies Freedom dies
[1:00:44] Liberty dies right right in the in the
[1:00:48] obscuring of truth but the same thing is
[1:00:51] true listen of the preaching of the
[1:00:54] Gospel listen when the nominations took
[1:00:57] Satan's lie the freedom died in the
[1:01:00] church but now here at the end time now
[1:01:03] that we have the full word the full son
[1:01:06] what happens de freedom is back again
[1:01:10] Liberty is back again I don't have
[1:01:11] somebody tell me what I can preach and
[1:01:13] what I can't preach Liberty is back in
[1:01:14] the house of God again you don't have
[1:01:16] somebody telling you how you got to
[1:01:17] worship Liberty is back in the house of
[1:01:19] God
[1:01:21] again are you with me now when there's
[1:01:24] no truth there's no freedom freedom
[1:01:25] doesn't bind us anytime someone tells

[1:02:30] we live in what are we free from we're
[1:02:32] free from tribulation did you know that
[1:02:34] we're free from the tribulation period
[1:02:36] the r said the church will go through
[1:02:38] the tribulation yes sir but the bride is
[1:02:40] free from it she'll go in the Rapture in
[1:02:43] a moment in a twinkling of an eye she'll
[1:02:45] be caught up to meet her Lord in the air
[1:02:47] for the wedding supper she has nothing
[1:02:48] to go through any tribulation about her
[1:02:50] Lord has paid her price aren't you glad
[1:02:53] that you're free that today you're free
[1:02:55] from the tribulation period you're free
[1:02:58] from judgment
[1:03:00] yes right yeah true do we actually
[1:03:03] believe that yeah we are judged here we
[1:03:06] stand before God here so that when we
[1:03:09] get over there we don't stand before God
[1:03:11] at the white Throne judgment but we
[1:03:13] minister to him Daniel 7:10 a fiery
[1:03:17] stream issued and came forth from before
[1:03:18] him thousand thousands ministered to him
[1:03:22] a prophet told us that was us we're the
[1:03:25] ones who minister to him we're like the
[1:03:27] wife to the husband ministering to him
[1:03:30] and brother brandom even made that that
[1:03:31] that's happening now that the bride is
[1:03:33] ministering to Christ by becoming the
[1:03:35] word he said thousands thousands
[1:03:38] ministered to him 10,000 times 10,000
[1:03:40] stood before him the Judgment was set
[1:03:42] the books were open but we are not
[1:03:44] standing before him waiting to hear what
[1:03:46] he's got to say we are not waiting to
[1:03:49] hear whether we're going to be free or
[1:03:50] not whether we're going to be saved or
[1:03:52] not whether we're going to go to hell or
[1:03:53] not but we've already received a pro
[1:03:56] we've already got a token we've made it
[1:03:58] into the throne room oh I hope you're
[1:04:01] hearing me today we're free from
[1:04:04] judgment amen he came why because we've
[1:04:08] already been judged sin has been dealt
[1:04:10] with in our lives here and the blood of
[1:04:12] Jesus Christ has cleansed us from all
[1:04:15] someone say all all sin yes amen so glad
[1:04:21] of that now the B said he came in 10,000
[1:04:25] time 10,000s came to him and judgment
[1:04:27] was set the books were open another book
[1:04:29] was open which The Book of Life they
[1:04:30] were judged thus who was this that come
[1:04:33] the bride which did not have to come to
[1:04:35] judgment she's free from
[1:04:37] judgment look the full son all right
[1:04:43] right has made us completely free
[1:04:47] yes now now the second thing that I
[1:04:49] thought of is the husk at the hour that
[1:04:54] we live in the the lake Harvest at the
[1:04:57] very end of the Harvest remember the
[1:04:59] type of Ruth the type of the the the
[1:05:02] seasons at the hour we live in the husk
[1:05:05] is looking for Revival but the seed is
[1:05:09] in
[1:05:10] Revival now we got to identify with one
[1:05:12] of those two things today yeah we're
[1:05:14] either looking for Revival or we're in
[1:05:18] Revival right right and so you it's hard
[1:05:23] sometimes for us to understand that but
[1:05:25] everything we have need of you say well
[1:05:27] I need a personal Revival you may I need
[1:05:29] it many times but it's already within me
[1:05:32] what it takes to have a personal Revival
[1:05:35] I don't have to call in a special
[1:05:36] speaker I don't have to even preach
[1:05:38] myself I don't even have to go to church
[1:05:40] for that and it frees us up you know
[1:05:43] what it does it frees the bride where
[1:05:45] we're not coming here looking for
[1:05:47] something as much although we do that
[1:05:49] we're actually coming here to worship
[1:05:51] God because we know the Revival's inside
[1:05:53] of us we're not having to pull it down
[1:05:56] we're not what what did Paul say he said
[1:05:59] what sayth the word he said he's not in
[1:06:01] another country or somewhere else he
[1:06:02] said but the word is n thee even in my
[1:06:04] mouth yeah right and so you're not
[1:06:07] looking for something far off somewhere
[1:06:09] but it's it's a Revival on the inside
[1:06:12] brother Bram said speaking of uh
[1:06:14] messiah's and Messiah X when he was
[1:06:16] preaching the world is again falling
[1:06:18] apart he said so what we hollering about
[1:06:21] a messiah what are we hollering Revival
[1:06:23] in our time back this that and the other
[1:06:26] what are they looking for to do it what
[1:06:28] more do you want what does the church
[1:06:30] want
[1:06:31] anyhow this is
[1:06:33] important it's important because our
[1:06:36] mindset towards the bride's Revival and
[1:06:39] our attitude towards it is going to
[1:06:41] determine what we get out of it yeah and
[1:06:44] I've told you before we're in the
[1:06:46] bride's Revival we just need to
[1:06:47] participate in it yes right each one of
[1:06:51] us personally just needs to participate
[1:06:53] in it but this is the bride's reval
[1:06:56] how can you say that well the same way
[1:06:57] you can say at the end of the year it's
[1:06:59] harvest time right that's the hour we're
[1:07:02] living in the latter rain's already come
[1:07:04] the everything's already taken place the
[1:07:06] rain is fell we're here and the bride is
[1:07:09] the only thing that is in Revival right
[1:07:12] yes so now what are you looking for he
[1:07:14] said what because if you're looking for
[1:07:16] something else to come then you won't
[1:07:18] recognize what you already have and
[1:07:21] you'll find yourself without Revival
[1:07:23] because you're looking for Revival does
[1:07:25] that make sense right not recognizing
[1:07:27] the Revival that's already come and
[1:07:29] whenever you find somebody who's always
[1:07:31] looking back to the past always looking
[1:07:33] back well back in my day back in I know
[1:07:35] it's harder for older people as you get
[1:07:37] older you begin to think well it was
[1:07:39] better back 20 years ago or 50 years ago
[1:07:41] I remember when I had my full strength
[1:07:43] and things like that but don't you
[1:07:45] realize today is the best day that
[1:07:47] you've ever lived all right because now
[1:07:50] we have an understanding of the word we
[1:07:51] never had before we've got we've got a
[1:07:53] moving of God that that that's going
[1:07:55] greater and greater and greater and yet
[1:07:57] people look at it and despise it right
[1:07:59] just like they despise the second temple
[1:08:01] yeah but they despise it because they
[1:08:03] didn't recognize the value of it oh
[1:08:05] church if we could just recognize what
[1:08:08] God's doing in our day but anytime you
[1:08:10] find somebody that's always looking back
[1:08:11] always well uh you know back in the day
[1:08:14] it was better we need to go back we need
[1:08:16] to go back well that's what the shut
[1:08:19] does right well we need to go back to
[1:08:22] where it was that's where T shut does
[1:08:25] right that's what Republicans are doing
[1:08:27] Democrats are doing they just want to go
[1:08:28] back to different eras but everybody
[1:08:30] wanted to go back and then you got a
[1:08:32] group they want to go well someday
[1:08:34] someday we'll we'll have it right
[1:08:36] someday brother Brandon will come back
[1:08:38] and everything will be okay or someday
[1:08:40] some preacher is going to come by and
[1:08:41] we'll be in Revival someday there'll be
[1:08:43] a move of God don't you realize what's
[1:08:45] happening they don't have a revelation
[1:08:46] of what God did because if you know what
[1:08:49] God did I'm not going by feeling I'm not
[1:08:51] telling you there's a Revival because I
[1:08:52] feel like Revival I'm not telling you
[1:08:55] that there's a Revival because I because
[1:08:57] I see it with my eyes I'm telling you
[1:08:59] because the word says it yes sir and if
[1:09:01] it's here for you we can participate in
[1:09:04] right you know what that does it takes
[1:09:06] away all the excuses oh
[1:09:08] yeah the shuck has an excuse for being a
[1:09:11] shuck that's what it was meant to be the
[1:09:15] tossel has an excuse for being a tossel
[1:09:17] the Methodist have an excuse for being a
[1:09:19] Methodist the Baptists have an excuse
[1:09:20] for being a Baptist but you and I have
[1:09:22] no excuse we must be the original word
[1:09:26] amen that's what God's called us to be
[1:09:29] sir amen now look said well that's
[1:09:33] difficult for me brother Ben you don't
[1:09:34] know my pastor what's been going on
[1:09:36] listen you either believe you're an
[1:09:38] eternal seed Gene of God or you don't
[1:09:41] and if God allowed all those things to
[1:09:42] happen in your life there must be some
[1:09:44] reason he had to bring you he had to he
[1:09:46] had to he had to lead you he had to let
[1:09:48] you go he had to bring you to the place
[1:09:50] where you're at right now for a specific
[1:09:53] reason because all things work together
[1:09:55] for good to them that love God and are
[1:09:56] called according to his purpose that we
[1:09:58] got to believe that we got to wrap our
[1:10:00] minds around that and begin to recognize
[1:10:02] God I'm just going to come in and
[1:10:03] believe the message of the hour I'm not
[1:10:05] going to sit out on the outside anymore
[1:10:06] I'm going to believe it right I'm going
[1:10:08] to grab a hold of
[1:10:10] it because there's no reason being
[1:10:12] miserable there there's no point in
[1:10:14] being miserable right right you might as
[1:10:16] well just come on in and participate all
[1:10:19] right like a person scared of the water
[1:10:22] you know there no point in being
[1:10:23] miserable I don't swim swim but I like
[1:10:26] the water but I don't swim but I'll tell
[1:10:29] you this ain't no point in being
[1:10:30] miserable I get in it and splash around
[1:10:33] anyway my and who knows if I get in the
[1:10:36] water and begin to love really love the
[1:10:37] water maybe I'll learn to
[1:10:41] swim you kids there's no point in
[1:10:43] sitting there waiting on somebody else
[1:10:44] to have all the fun you might as well
[1:10:46] get in while the water's troubled
[1:10:49] there's no point in watching everybody
[1:10:50] else get healed you get in while the
[1:10:52] water's troubled let let let that
[1:10:53] healing become your healing let that
[1:10:55] testimony become your
[1:10:58] testimony good so brother BR we've
[1:11:01] already got
[1:11:02] it now if he can say that I got to say
[1:11:05] what a prophet said because that is
[1:11:07] prophesying right that's that's me
[1:11:10] saying what God Said we've already got
[1:11:12] it God gave it to us it's his promise
[1:11:15] for this hour we look in the Bible we
[1:11:17] see it everywhere Through the Bible

[1:11:33] this is
[1:11:34] him glory to God this is him what needed
[1:11:37] to happen in our hour the book had to be
[1:11:39] open are you with me now it was already
[1:11:42] him but it had to be open so we could
[1:11:44] see who he was yes glory to God he was
[1:11:49] he had to be introduced to us right so
[1:11:52] that he said this is him the word in the
[1:11:53] beginning was the word and the Word was
[1:11:54] with God and the Word was God and the
[1:11:56] word remains God Hebrews 138 the same
[1:11:58] yesterday today and forever he said we
[1:12:00] know that it's supposed to take place in
[1:12:02] this day we're wanting a messiah and God
[1:12:04] gave us the Messiah his promised word
[1:12:07] for this day it's just waiting for

[1:12:18] God you got a measure of faith God give
[1:12:20] you faith and that just that same faith
[1:12:22] that you use when you got born again
[1:12:24] that same faith they'll take you in a
[1:12:25] Rapture one day because it's the season
[1:12:28] for it but look God gave us the Messiah
[1:12:31] his promised word it's just waiting for
[1:12:33] somebody with faith to anoint it and
[1:12:35] make it live
[1:12:37] again he said yes sir it's a real
[1:12:39] Messiah it's the word of God which Jesus
[1:12:41] said both Heaven and Earth will pass
[1:12:42] away my word shall never pass away but
[1:12:45] the church sits spiritually dead gone
[1:12:48] the hour has passed
[1:12:51] them you know there's and and I I don't
[1:12:56] like preaching against message people
[1:12:58] because I'm a message person right I I'm
[1:13:00] one of you but I'll say this there's
[1:13:02] people that sit in the message
[1:13:04] spiritually
[1:13:05] Dead Brother B said the church sits
[1:13:07] spiritually dead gone the hour is pasted
[1:13:11] them there's people sitting the message
[1:13:12] waiting on something to come spiritually
[1:13:14] dead yeah and being spiritually dead is
[1:13:17] not just uh just not shouting or not
[1:13:20] speaking in tongues because the
[1:13:22] Pentecostals do that and they're
[1:13:23] spiritually dead yeah yeah right but the
[1:13:26] hour is past him they're in a slump and
[1:13:29] hardly know what to do one running this
[1:13:32] way and one that way and hear every
[1:13:34] promise that God made in the Bible every
[1:13:36] one of them is laying there just as good
[1:13:40] as they ever
[1:13:41] was glory to God every promise just as
[1:13:45] good justification sanctification the
[1:13:47] restoration it's all just as good as it
[1:13:49] ever was it's the hour what makes the
[1:13:52] church like this he said we're in the
[1:13:53] age of the leoa when she has to come
[1:13:56] this way this is the hour for it yes
[1:13:59] this is a time of trouble how many
[1:14:01] recognize that today but we're in
[1:14:04] Revival the bible promises that Psalms
[1:14:06] 138:7 though I walk in the midst of
[1:14:09] trouble thou Wilt revive me Thou shalt
[1:14:13] stretch forth thine hand against the
[1:14:14] wrath of mine enemies that right hand
[1:14:16] shall save me Psalm 275 he said for in
[1:14:18] the time of trouble what was this
[1:14:21] brother Brown said this was a background
[1:14:22] or preview to the Rapture a background
[1:14:25] scripture for the Rapture for in the
[1:14:26] time of trouble he shall hide me in his
[1:14:29] Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle
[1:14:31] shall he hide me he shall set me upon a
[1:14:33] rock now shall my head be lifted up
[1:14:35] above my enemies round about me
[1:14:37] therefore will I offer in his Tabernacle
[1:14:39] sacrifices of Joy I will sing yeah I
[1:14:42] will sing praises to the Lord why is why
[1:14:44] are we revived why do we sing why are we
[1:14:46] happy because we know we're hidden under
[1:14:49] the third pole under the opening of the
[1:14:51] word under the Rapture
[1:14:53] Revelation come on Church all right that
[1:14:56] that ought to make us run all over the
[1:14:58] building if we really understood what it
[1:15:01] was yeah and you realize how silly
[1:15:03] carnal interpretations of the word are
[1:15:06] yeah right how how could a tent a
[1:15:08] physical tent hide me it can barely hide
[1:15:11] me from the cold and the
[1:15:12] wind right good tornado Come Blow it
[1:15:15] away but this is something we're going
[1:15:17] to be hidden in that won't be blown away

[1:15:23] that the Winds of this world can't The
[1:15:25] Winds of politics I have no effect on it

[1:16:57] good the husk continues to focus on
[1:17:02] gifts but the seed has the giver now
[1:17:04] remember the age was the restoration of
[1:17:07] the
[1:17:08] gifts and the Pentecostal Church brother
[1:17:12] R said they is it cow or cabbage cabbage
[1:17:16] down on Joel I'm waiting on you to
[1:17:18] correct me I I forgot brother B uses one
[1:17:22] of those terms
[1:17:25] and he said they they they they knuckled
[1:17:27] down say it that way on speaking in
[1:17:31] tongues right they said that was the
[1:17:34] evidence of the Holy Ghost what was it
[1:17:36] the Shu forming a denomination pulling
[1:17:39] away from the wheat yeah they continued
[1:17:41] to focus on restoration of gifts that's
[1:17:44] what we need but that's what we have
[1:17:47] yeah right we already have it we're not
[1:17:51] looking for it we want it to manifest
[1:17:54] itself
[1:17:55] as we manifest love joy and peace and
[1:17:57] all the other things we want the gifts
[1:17:58] to manifest right brother brand told us
[1:18:01] how to do that but but we don't focus on
[1:18:04] the gifts because it's not where the
[1:18:05] light is today it'd be just like if I
[1:18:08] come up here and just preached a a
[1:18:10] justif justification message every time
[1:18:13] now there's a time for that I got to
[1:18:14] preach that because these kids need to
[1:18:16] know that they're Justified right right
[1:18:18] you you all of you need to know that you
[1:18:20] need to be reminded of that but that's
[1:18:21] not all I preach right right it can't be
[1:18:23] all I preach because if my focus gets on
[1:18:25] that alone then what happens is I leave
[1:18:28] off the light of the hour right which is
[1:18:31] the rapture that's the age that we live
[1:18:33] in yeah so we've got to preach the full
[1:18:35] word and not leave those things off but
[1:18:38] we don't focus on those things and yet
[1:18:41] we have more than a gift we have the
[1:18:43] giver right are you with me now now
[1:18:47] that's why it was such a a deceptive age
[1:18:49] remember Pentecost because of the gifts
[1:18:51] because it looked like that must be the
[1:18:53] Pinnacle but it wasn't all the God
[1:18:55] wanted to give us but the P said now the
[1:18:57] trouble with people today he said we
[1:18:58] find them living in the glare of another
[1:19:00] age just like Jesus found when he come
[1:19:02] he found them living in the glare of the
[1:19:04] law and ignoring what what was to take
[1:19:06] place in his age he said you know what's
[1:19:08] the matter today what was the matter
[1:19:09] with the Lutheran well because they were
[1:19:11] living in the glare of the Lutheran age
[1:19:12] when John Wesley found the secret of
[1:19:14] sanctification they couldn't go because
[1:19:17] they were living in the glare of
[1:19:18] Luther's age what's H what happened to
[1:19:20] the Pentecostal is why Wesley was so
[1:19:22] organized until he was living in the
[1:19:24] glare of another age age it was in
[1:19:25] Wesley's age when the baptism of the
[1:19:27] Holy Ghost fell upon the Pentecostals
[1:19:29] you see and some of them were good
[1:19:30] people way we knew some of those people
[1:19:32] in the westan age they were good people
[1:19:34] but they they looked at speak in tongu
[1:19:36] said that's
[1:19:37] nonsense right and that was the age
[1:19:40] that's how God was moving was in the
[1:19:42] restoration of the gifts but they they
[1:19:43] couldn't move on with it right and so
[1:19:46] brother bom talked about how the
[1:19:47] Pharisees did the same thing Jesus told
[1:19:49] him said if You' have known Moses you'd
[1:19:51] have known me right right if you really
[1:19:53] knew the word if you really knew what
[1:19:54] you were talking about about you know
[1:19:55] that I was the next
[1:19:57] step amen I am the fullness right that's
[1:20:00] what he was now God he said God
[1:20:02] identifying interpreting his scripture
[1:20:03] for that age it's always Christ it's
[1:20:07] Christ in every age he's the same
[1:20:09] yesterday today and forever it's always
[1:20:11] been Christ he said now we find out that
[1:20:14] now we find our Pentecostal Brethren are
[1:20:16] living in the glare of a Pentecostal age
[1:20:18] and they still miss it they're trying to
[1:20:22] interpret the Pentecostal age when we're
[1:20:24] past that now some of you lived in that
[1:20:27] right they're still trying to manifest
[1:20:29] gifts and interpret the Pentecostal age
[1:20:32] and they're successful in that but the
[1:20:35] word passed on by them and that's why
[1:20:36] they uh that's why brother Paul they
[1:20:38] could live any way they want to and have
[1:20:40] gifts that's yeah right but we want
[1:20:43] gifts but we want the giver we want to
[1:20:45] live right we want to we want to do
[1:20:47] right but see here they they can do that
[1:20:50] because they're the age passed them by
[1:20:53] right they're living in the glare of of
[1:20:54] a Pentecostal age and they still miss it
[1:20:56] they're trying to interpret the
[1:20:57] Pentecostal age when we're plumbed past
[1:20:59] that we're living on up to the rapturing
[1:21:01] time for the coming of the end time but
[1:21:04] that's the way man does it's just to be
[1:21:06] that way now glare excuse me is a false
[1:21:08] light it's a false light now a false
[1:21:11] light brother brandom taught us that the
[1:21:13] greatest robbery that was ever done was
[1:21:14] done by a false light right right the
[1:21:17] armored truck robbery in England he said
[1:21:19] it was a false sight it was a glare that
[1:21:21] caused them to to stop and then it was a
[1:21:23] great robbery it was a great robbery
[1:21:25] done to the church because they could
[1:21:27] not move on because they were seeing
[1:21:30] something else yes and that's exactly
[1:21:33] what's going on in our day many people
[1:21:35] come to the message they see a prophet
[1:21:37] but they can't see the bride they see a
[1:21:39] prophet but they can't see a
[1:21:41] manifestation they may see gifts but
[1:21:43] they can't see the word and so what is
[1:21:45] it becomes the glare that actually
[1:21:47] prevents them from moving on so brother
[1:21:50] BR said Pharisees Sadducees herodians
[1:21:52] whatever it might be they got the world
[1:21:53] so gumed up like they did in all ages
[1:21:56] that they could not see the real light
[1:21:57] it put their eyes out they was used to
[1:21:59] walking in the glare listen next day
[1:22:02] it'll be
[1:22:03] this this is what someone does in the
[1:22:05] glare yeah next day it'll be this
[1:22:08] tomorrow it'll be this we'll join this
[1:22:11] and it'll be that we'll join that he
[1:22:14] said we find it's a false Mirage right
[1:22:18] it's always a promise what is a mirage a
[1:22:20] promise of something in the future that
[1:22:21] never
[1:22:23] materializes right you see SE old
[1:22:24] western you know the old guy and he's
[1:22:26] stumbling along and here's a mirage
[1:22:28] there's water oh oh I'm going to get
[1:22:29] that water and he gets there and he
[1:22:31] falls he stumbles and there it is
[1:22:32] there's no water so he sees another one
[1:22:35] he goes towards it pretty soon he dies
[1:22:37] of thirst because he doesn't have the
[1:22:39] water he's looking forward to what he
[1:22:41] think where he thinks the water is but
[1:22:43] it never materialized don't you realize
[1:22:45] church that's not where the bride lives
[1:22:47] we don't live in an age where we're
[1:22:48] looking forward looking forward look at
[1:22:50] what's next what's this going to be
[1:22:51] we're living in a time when the water is
[1:22:53] right here by what do you have need of
[1:22:55] today where what do you have need of in
[1:22:57] healing the water for healing is right
[1:22:59] by you listen to me this is important
[1:23:01] this morning you young couples you
[1:23:03] sometimes we when we're young we did it
[1:23:05] too all of us did it you fuss and you
[1:23:07] fight and you kind of settling things in
[1:23:09] your home don't you realize that the
[1:23:11] water that you need to make your home
[1:23:13] right is right in this
[1:23:15] message right the the word that you need
[1:23:18] the water that you need you just need
[1:23:20] the Holy Spirit to bathe you down and
[1:23:22] get in the presence of the message and
[1:23:24] realize who you are yes some of you
[1:23:26] looking for a husband looking for a wife
[1:23:29] yeah you realize that you realize that
[1:23:31] what you need is in the
[1:23:33] message right you're looking for a
[1:23:35] person to come and what you really need
[1:23:37] is the messag amen all right and then if
[1:23:39] you really get in this message you'll
[1:23:41] find out that that that what you have
[1:23:43] need of is there and then you can be
[1:23:44] ready to be married to a husband or a
[1:23:48] wife water's right by you don't reject
[1:23:53] it but believe believe it's there yeah
[1:23:56] Heen now
[1:23:57] look brother BR said Jesus Christ is
[1:24:00] just as real today to a human heart as
[1:24:02] he ever was all right if he ever solved
[1:24:04] a marriage problem he can do it today
[1:24:06] yes if he ever if he ever got somebody a
[1:24:10] job right provided for you he can do it
[1:24:13] today if he ever provided healing he can
[1:24:16] do it today right whatever it is that he
[1:24:18] had he can do it today where do we mess
[1:24:20] up church when we get away from him when
[1:24:23] we don't follow his leading
[1:24:24] when we begin to leave the word for
[1:24:26] sensation or something else that's when
[1:24:29] we that's when we mess up but the word's
[1:24:32] always right it's always going to be
[1:24:34] right yeah oh my not in our
[1:24:35] interpretation of it but just the word
[1:24:37] itself true brother brand said Jesus
[1:24:40] Christ is just as real today to a human
[1:24:41] heart as he ever was his power and his
[1:24:43] living presence is just as real today as
[1:24:46] it ever was listen you young people hear
[1:24:48] your parents talk about getting saved
[1:24:50] and how they come to God and how they
[1:24:52] come out of a life of sin don't you
[1:24:53] realize he's just as real this morning
[1:24:56] as he ever was you can be just as born
[1:24:58] again as they were you can want to serve
[1:25:00] God with all your heart just like they
[1:25:02] did you can receive the baptism of the
[1:25:05] Holy Ghost just like I did just like we
[1:25:07] did are you with me Church
[1:25:11] yes well some of us are anyway I'm wound
[1:25:14] up this morning but I I'm not going to
[1:25:16] over preach I
[1:25:18] promise I'll leave you all alone after a
[1:25:20] while
[1:25:27] I bit my tongue right there that's
[1:25:28] maturity brother Joel someday somay
[1:25:31] that's coming yes that's
[1:25:33] maturity now look do you love the Lord
[1:25:36] this morning he's just as real as he
[1:25:39] ever was Lo a little while in the world
[1:25:42] won't see me no more Cosmos the order of
[1:25:44] the world won't see no more no more yet
[1:25:46] you shall see me I'll be with you even
[1:25:48] even in you to the end of the world the
[1:25:50] works that I do shall you do also even
[1:25:52] greater than this should you do CU I go
[1:25:53] to my father yeah that great promise is
[1:25:57] all today yes so knowing this brother
[1:26:02] I'm teaches this over and over and over
[1:26:03] again that precludes any doctrine that
[1:26:05] would put him off to be a god of
[1:26:07] tomorrow all right yes right or a god of
[1:26:10] yesterday the world is as blind as they
[1:26:13] can be but there is a ye that shall see
[1:26:15] me yes and that's what we're trying to
[1:26:18] get today right he said what the Full
[1:26:20] Gospel mean is to express Jesus Christ
[1:26:23] in the power of his resurrection and all
[1:26:26] the fullness of his promises that the
[1:26:28] Holy Ghost manifest these things and
[1:26:30] make them right that God has promised
[1:26:32] and listen he will do it oh that
[1:26:37] comforts me this morning knowing he will
[1:26:41] do
[1:26:43] it see that age focused on the gifts and
[1:26:46] not the giver but Paul tells us the more
[1:26:48] excellent way is love so there was a
[1:26:50] higher way way the Corinthian Church was
[1:26:52] approaching the gifts there higher way
[1:26:55] to approach that yet he told them to
[1:26:57] covet earnestly the best gifts but
[1:26:59] there's a more excellent way now brother
[1:27:02] brand said I'd rather have a church that
[1:27:03] knows nothing about any spiritual gift
[1:27:06] and just be so in love with each other
[1:27:07] and with
[1:27:09] Christ all right think about it for a
[1:27:11] minute yeah well got quiet I'd rather
[1:27:14] have that than every spiritual gift
[1:27:16] operating in the
[1:27:17] church now that might might sound hard
[1:27:20] in a Pentecostal group he said but I'd
[1:27:21] rather have it where there's gifts
[1:27:23] they'll fail
[1:27:24] where there's gifts that'll bring
[1:27:26] confusion where there's gifts that can
[1:27:27] be questioned where there is love it is
[1:27:31] perfect yes huh right brother brandom
[1:27:34] never told us before we went to the
[1:27:36] other place we had to have perfect gifts
[1:27:39] right because we'll never have perfect
[1:27:40] gifts we did say we had that perfect
[1:27:42] love
[1:27:44] right right he said that's right he said
[1:27:47] so work first with love yeah right begin
[1:27:51] there that brings fellowship and
[1:27:54] Fellowship brings
[1:27:56] gifts it's been used and abused but we
[1:27:59] think about Elijah and brother BR
[1:28:01] preaches those series of sermons when
[1:28:02] he's preaching about Elijah and that
[1:28:05] still Small Voice and where art thou
[1:28:07] Elijah and different sermons like that
[1:28:10] and it's been abused many times to say
[1:28:12] well we don't need emotion anymore we
[1:28:14] don't need and I'm here to to say we
[1:28:16] still need to feel the presence of God
[1:28:18] in our
[1:28:19] midst there's a reason why God sent the
[1:28:22] fire there's a reason why God sent the
[1:28:23] wind
[1:28:25] Thunder but the Lord himself wasn't in
[1:28:27] it he was listening for the voice of the
[1:28:30] sign there's always a voice to the sign
[1:28:33] Elijah waited through those things and
[1:28:36] then responds to the voice and brother
[1:28:39] BR said I just wonder if we haven't
[1:28:40] listened too much to rushing Mighty
[1:28:41] winds and Fire and Blood everything else
[1:28:44] and have failed to hear that still Small
[1:28:45] Voice wonder if he can still speak to us
[1:28:48] today maybe you're not caught up in
[1:28:50] gifts maybe you're caught up in the
[1:28:51] world yeah can he still talk
[1:28:56] yeah are you hearing me this morning can
[1:28:59] he still talk to you is there still a is
[1:29:01] there still do you still have the
[1:29:03] ability to speak to your heart are you
[1:29:05] so caught up in work so caught up in
[1:29:07] friends so caught up in Netflix and you
[1:29:10] can't see him you can't hear him so God
[1:29:13] help us today we so caught up doing good
[1:29:16] things we're real busy right now getting
[1:29:18] ready for meetings getting doing all
[1:29:20] these things but we don't want to get so
[1:29:21] busy that we forget to hear that still
[1:29:23] small voice brother Joe he's got to be
[1:29:25] able to speak to us he wants to speak to
[1:29:28] us through his word yeah are we are we
[1:29:31] listening today said I wonder if we've
[1:29:33] looked so much to gifts we can't see The
[1:29:36] Giver he said see we're so prone to go
[1:29:38] after the gift instead of the giver when
[1:29:40] you see signs and wonders take place
[1:29:42] don't notice the sign so much but look
[1:29:44] what's behind it it's that still Small
[1:29:47] Voice that speaks he said that's the
[1:29:49] reason we can't have revivals in America
[1:29:51] is because people go after gifts instead
[1:29:53] of The Giver yeah that's what's the
[1:29:54] matter with the world tonight oh we got
[1:29:56] it if you want great crowds and
[1:29:57] audiences you have to have a real
[1:29:59] classical Hollywood outfit with a lot of
[1:30:00] show American people want entertainment
[1:30:03] he said they don't want the true Gospel
[1:30:05] of the Lord Jesus Christ so therefore
[1:30:07] the radio and the television would give
[1:30:08] them more entertainment than the church
[1:30:10] can do and they stay home all right
[1:30:12] right now church I'm just preaching to
[1:30:14] you because I'm I live in this age too
[1:30:17] all right I'm affected by it too but we
[1:30:20] all carry these around and it's more
[1:30:22] entertaining than Church all
[1:30:26] right come on we we don't like to admit
[1:30:28] that but it's
[1:30:29] true but it depends on what you want
[1:30:32] right if you're looking for
[1:30:34] entertainment then you're going to spend
[1:30:35] more time in that than you will in the
[1:30:36] house of God you going to spend more
[1:30:38] time in that than you are in the word of
[1:30:39] God but if you're looking for the gospel
[1:30:42] of the Lord Jesus listen that you'll
[1:30:44] find it he's still the same as he ever
[1:30:46] was we just got to look past the wind
[1:30:49] and the fire look past all these things
[1:30:50] and seek and he still speak to us
[1:30:54] he man he said the radio and the
[1:30:57] television give them more entertainment
[1:30:58] than the church can do it and they stay
[1:30:59] home and I understand I'm not I'm
[1:31:02] knocking at you people that have to be
[1:31:03] at home Sometimes some of you Elders
[1:31:04] Astound me how much you're able to be in
[1:31:07] the house of God my hats off to you
[1:31:09] thank you for being here we love you we
[1:31:11] love you with all of our hearts that's
[1:31:13] all
[1:31:15] right thank you for being here I say to
[1:31:18] our young families thank you I I just
[1:31:20] astounded all the time how faithful
[1:31:22] people are to the house of God I'll say
[1:31:24] this there's a higher calling we're not
[1:31:25] living in a Pentecostal age we're not
[1:31:27] living in a Methodist we're called to
[1:31:29] something higher we're called to a
[1:31:31] rapture we don't want entertainment we
[1:31:34] want the
[1:31:35] word amen he said all that comes out is
[1:31:39] the elect of God you're here for a
[1:31:42] reason this morning all that comes out
[1:31:44] is the elect of God that's still
[1:31:46] hungering and thirsting and calling and
[1:31:48] crying for the real thing of God all
[1:31:50] that that would be me this morning that
[1:31:52] would identify me as the wheat and not
[1:31:54] the
[1:31:55] Chug that's good I want you to
[1:31:58] understand this morning as we I won't
[1:32:00] trry too much longer but any gift could
[1:32:03] be impersonated yeah and in fact and
[1:32:07] this made me think of this the husk is
[1:32:09] an
[1:32:10] impersonator the Pentecostal Church
[1:32:12] though it was God's
[1:32:13] church but it became an
[1:32:16] impersonator it went from a carrier to
[1:32:18] being an impersonator of the true seed
[1:32:22] yes even down to attempting to
[1:32:25] impersonate the sign of the son of man
[1:32:27] which we know was uh brother brandom's
[1:32:29] particular gift actually had two uh
[1:32:31] actually he called them signs remember
[1:32:34] Moses was given two signs he was given
[1:32:37] the sign of the he toss his rod down
[1:32:38] Aaron's rod down to become a snake
[1:32:41] remember and the second sign was the
[1:32:42] sign of leprosy
[1:32:44] cleansed right from his hand so he was
[1:32:46] given the two signs and brother BR says
[1:32:48] the third sign is spiritual death right
[1:32:51] so you need to believe the voice amen of
[1:32:53] the sign yeah so you don't die
[1:32:57] spiritually and and so any if if you
[1:33:00] would go in that day and you look around
[1:33:02] and and you'd see that you know Moses
[1:33:06] throwing his rod down that God gave him
[1:33:08] that sign right the god-given scriptural
[1:33:11] sign yeah right but then there were men
[1:33:14] named Janice and jambers who were
[1:33:16] impersonators right and they come along
[1:33:18] and threw down the same thing I want you
[1:33:20] to understand that those peculiar gifts
[1:33:23] were given to Moses alone yeah yeah
[1:33:27] right I I've never heard you know I'm
[1:33:30] sure there have been some who tried but
[1:33:31] I've never heard of someone grabbing
[1:33:33] that somebody's hand and knowing the
[1:33:36] disease in their by their hand brother
[1:33:37] brandham did that right now that's
[1:33:40] peculiar isn't it why would God do that
[1:33:42] because it was something identifying
[1:33:43] there's something different about his
[1:33:44] ministry yeah right and then the secrets
[1:33:48] of the hearts was even beyond that
[1:33:49] because what is it it's what Jesus
[1:33:52] did right he's doing it again it's the
[1:33:55] sign of the son of
[1:33:56] man right and it wasn't here so we just
[1:33:59] follow the sign but to tell us the word
[1:34:00] was here yeah the son of man Christ the
[1:34:02] word the word is the discerner of the
[1:34:04] thoughts and tense of the heart so the
[1:34:05] word is here but if you saw say in Moses
[1:34:09] day some guy come along you you'd never
[1:34:10] seen Moses
[1:34:12] and but you had heard he had these these
[1:34:14] signs and somebody come along doing that
[1:34:17] and and and and throwing their rod down
[1:34:19] and become a serpent and you ask them
[1:34:21] are you Moses no no I'm not Moses
[1:34:25] well you must be an impersonator of
[1:34:27] Moses cuz it's one or the
[1:34:29] other right so any person using that
[1:34:32] gift of discernment or or the sign in
[1:34:34] the hand those two signs that brother
[1:34:37] brand was given it may be a man of God
[1:34:39] or wonderful person but it becomes an
[1:34:42] impersonation because we were given that
[1:34:44] for a reason BR said I don't see your
[1:34:47] pastor or anybody Bo have to weight off
[1:34:49] my shoulders CU I don't have that gift
[1:34:52] but he said I don't see your Pastor tell
[1:34:54] your pastor anybody would be taking the
[1:34:55] gift of discernment they don't have to
[1:34:57] do that that's not their calling that's
[1:34:58] not their calling to do that that's to
[1:35:00] be one in an
[1:35:01] age and so B the Bible tells us that
[1:35:03] Janice and jambus withstood Moses and so
[1:35:06] do these also resist the truth men of
[1:35:08] corrupt Minds reprobate concerning the
[1:35:10] faith that's very strong but there were
[1:35:12] many Who come out you've all seen them
[1:35:13] you don't see as many today but you can
[1:35:15] go on YouTube and find what they call
[1:35:17] discernment or or a word of knowledge
[1:35:20] and you can you can find it on there and
[1:35:22] it's laughable to us but people are
[1:35:24] impressed by it right right because it's
[1:35:28] vague it's just it's just something out
[1:35:30] there somewhere but it doesn't have any
[1:35:32] real meaning and and it's not accurate
[1:35:35] but what is it it's something that that
[1:35:37] was meant to happen in this age what
[1:35:39] does it show us we're at the end time
[1:35:41] yeah there had to be if there was an
[1:35:42] impersonator it had to be a real oh my
[1:35:45] so they did the same thing brother
[1:35:47] talked about a little woman now this
[1:35:48] will blow your mind because you know
[1:35:50] sometimes you don't understand all that
[1:35:51] a pastor allows to go on in a church but
[1:35:54] sometimes you're trying to teach
[1:35:55] something by it and you don't always
[1:35:57] understand and people who uh you know
[1:35:59] there's rules in a church and there's
[1:36:01] order in a church but sometimes you let
[1:36:02] things go on maybe shouldn't go on just
[1:36:04] exactly but you're trying to show
[1:36:06] something or you're trying to work with
[1:36:08] people because people aren't
[1:36:11] machines right and and we all have to
[1:36:13] learn that people are not
[1:36:15] machines right and the truth is I can
[1:36:18] know something is right and true and yet
[1:36:21] if you come at me in the wrong way I
[1:36:23] could be offended by you telling me the
[1:36:26] truth right right because I'm human but
[1:36:29] yet we want we don't want to be like
[1:36:30] that do we we want to believe the word
[1:36:32] the truth of the word but we also want
[1:36:34] to present it in the right way brother
[1:36:36] brandham uh brother brandham had a woman
[1:36:39] come to the church one time he said come
[1:36:41] back there you remember he said she come
[1:36:43] back there and said the Lord give me the
[1:36:44] same
[1:36:45] gift and and when somebody said well we
[1:36:47] have the same gift as brother Brandon
[1:36:49] that's a
[1:36:50] problem and and I said well she said I
[1:36:52] wish I had a chance to prove it I said
[1:36:54] there's the platform imagine sitting
[1:36:56] through that
[1:36:58] service he said and You' seen what
[1:37:00] happened pure Mass psychology but when
[1:37:03] you see he said sister Snider coming up
[1:37:05] and told her she had arthritis he said
[1:37:06] that finished it I said that isn't
[1:37:08] what's wrong with the woman she fell and
[1:37:10] broke her hip and I said she she's not
[1:37:12] even standing there of course sister
[1:37:13] Snider didn't hear too well and what she
[1:37:15] had I believe was a growth in her
[1:37:16] stomach or something other wrong like
[1:37:17] that I said that's what it is sitting
[1:37:19] here talking to the Brethren about it
[1:37:20] the whole time he said but just to show
[1:37:22] that the church see this carnal
[1:37:24] comparison you see you what does that do
[1:37:26] it makes the real trumpet he said now
[1:37:28] when I was in Canada they picked up this
[1:37:30] fell went up there and said right in AB
[1:37:32] among a bunch of Norwegians he said the
[1:37:34] Lord tells me somebody in here crowd
[1:37:36] about 10 times his size he said somebody
[1:37:38] by the name of John maybe Johan's or
[1:37:40] Johan said right along in here I believe
[1:37:43] he said no said it's right along in here
[1:37:45] somewhere of course they took him out he
[1:37:46] said in a Norwegian country right
[1:37:48] there'd be a bunch of
[1:37:50] John's right and so he's showing the
[1:37:53] it's not accurate now we I saw that the
[1:37:55] other day somebody said they had
[1:37:56] discernment on YouTube and this guy goes
[1:37:58] up to a random person he says I see
[1:38:01] somebody in your life is is a a Aaron an
[1:38:06] Aaron the guy thought for a minute said
[1:38:09] oh I had a buddy in the fifth
[1:38:12] grade and he says well he needs
[1:38:14] encouragement right now and they said oh
[1:38:17] that's wonderful that's just so
[1:38:18] wonderful that's not what brother
[1:38:20] brandham
[1:38:21] did right
[1:38:23] he turned his back to the audience right
[1:38:26] come on and he spoke to those who didn't
[1:38:28] have prayer cards right and said your
[1:38:31] name is this is your address this is
[1:38:33] where you come from this is what's wrong
[1:38:34] with you what was that it was God
[1:38:36] manifesting himself right it wasn't just
[1:38:39] meant to show us what who A man was it
[1:38:41] was meant to show us the word was here
[1:38:43] come on yes amen yes and so brother Bram
[1:38:47] talks about that the Lord it tells me
[1:38:48] somebody's got back trouble I feel my
[1:38:50] back hurting anybody's been raised he
[1:38:51] said through the scripture knows that
[1:38:53] that's s chology and the Man actually
[1:38:55] turned out to be a a pervert was picked
[1:38:58] up in Canada for fraud but and I don't
[1:39:01] say that anyone would do that is that
[1:39:03] way but but the man was he wasn't even
[1:39:05] living it and so brother Brown said what
[1:39:07] is it doing is to give the trumpet an
[1:39:08] uncertain sound right just exactly the
[1:39:11] way it always is trying to do things
[1:39:12] like that to give an uncertain sound
[1:39:14] Satan's business to do that but he said
[1:39:16] but now don't ever vary from that word
[1:39:18] remember I charge you before God stay
[1:39:20] with that word don't you never vary from
[1:39:22] it he said if those things rise up among
[1:39:24] the people and things like that there's
[1:39:26] a genuine every time you got a false
[1:39:28] there's a bogus dollar shows there was a
[1:39:30] good dollar it was made off of oh it
[1:39:33] ought to make us go back and look and
[1:39:34] see what was it that a prophet actually
[1:39:36] did what was it that God did through him
[1:39:39] what is it the husk is an impersonator
[1:39:41] living in the glare but the wheat has
[1:39:43] the fullness of the word the Bible says
[1:39:45] their Folly will be made manifest unto
[1:39:46] all men they will proceed no further he
[1:39:49] said that but the Folly will be made
[1:39:50] manifest how is it made manifest when
[1:39:52] Jesus takes his bride and sets her up
[1:39:54] here and said this is her yeah and away
[1:39:57] he goes with her that's right their
[1:39:59] Folly will be made known right see the
[1:40:02] husk is preparing for tribulation the
[1:40:03] seed is ready for Rapture I'm
[1:40:06] closing but I know we got some Preppers
[1:40:09] around now look that's fine that's
[1:40:12] honestly if you want to prep and fill up
[1:40:14] your house with things that's a good
[1:40:16] thing that's not a bad thing uh some of
[1:40:18] our young people maybe could learn from
[1:40:20] that and and we could prepare better I
[1:40:22] could maybe learn from that
[1:40:23] we could prepare for natural disaster
[1:40:25] but you're not preparing for a
[1:40:26] tribulation
[1:40:28] all yeah that's not going to happen I
[1:40:30] I'm sorry to to break that to you but
[1:40:33] it's not going to happen I don't know
[1:40:35] who would want to go anyway in a time
[1:40:37] when it's the world is just going to be
[1:40:39] turned upside down we're going in a
[1:40:42] Rapture yeah see the Bible says as
[1:40:44] therefore the tears are gathered and
[1:40:46] burned in the fire so shall it be in the
[1:40:48] end of the this world the son of man
[1:40:50] shall send forth his angels they Shall
[1:40:51] Gather out of his kingdom all things
[1:40:52] that in then which do iniquity and shall
[1:40:55] cast them into a furnace of fire there
[1:40:57] shall be wailing and nashing of teeth
[1:40:58] that's the tribulation period yeah then
[1:41:01] shall the righteous shine forth as a son
[1:41:03] in the Kingdom of their father who hath
[1:41:06] ears to hear Let Him hear we don't go
[1:41:07] through that time yes again Malachi 4:1
[1:41:11] what was Malachi 4 he said behold I send
[1:41:13] you Elijah the prophet look how that
[1:41:15] that that uh chapter starts for behold
[1:41:17] the day cometh that shall burn us enough
[1:41:19] and all the proud all the do wickedly
[1:41:21] shall be stubble the day that cometh
[1:41:22] shall burn up say the Lord of hosts it
[1:41:24] shall leave them neither root nor Branch
[1:41:26] but unto you that fear my name shall the
[1:41:29] son of righteousness arise with healing
[1:41:31] in his wings and brother BR said it was
[1:41:33] healing campaigns he rise with what was
[1:41:36] it it was God coming in our age the
[1:41:37] former and the latter Reign so we'd be
[1:41:40] prepared to be the wheat and be caught
[1:41:42] out of this place one day we'd be laying
[1:41:44] in the presence of the son you shall go
[1:41:46] forth and grow up as Cales of the
[1:41:49] stall as musicians come what what
[1:41:52] condition are we in this this
[1:41:54] morning what condition are we in I want
[1:41:55] to make it now personal I know this has
[1:41:57] been very doctrinal but what condition
[1:41:59] are we in brother the brand said this is
[1:42:01] not the day of Pentecost the Pentecostal
[1:42:03] ages
[1:42:04] passed Pentecost is gone this is Harvest
[1:42:07] Time the Harvest Time the grain water's
[1:42:11] done been poured out the grain's getting
[1:42:13] ripe he said well what brother Ben what
[1:42:16] can I do well he tells us what to do
[1:42:18] come into the grain my dear brother yes
[1:42:22] come into the gra brain said hear me
[1:42:26] believe me if you believe me to be a
[1:42:28] servant of God let's each in our own way
[1:42:32] bow our head in humility what does that
[1:42:35] the full wheat that's come through late
[1:42:38] in the presence of the sun it caused its
[1:42:40] head to bow in humility let's bow our
[1:42:42] head in humility and offer the prayer
[1:42:45] that we know that we should
[1:42:47] offer God take me as I am all right I
[1:42:51] wonder if we could do that this morning
[1:42:53] if we could bow our
[1:42:54] heads I I believe you're wheat this
[1:42:56] morning I believe that's why you're
[1:42:59] here if that wheat bows its head and it
[1:43:03] says Lord I want to be but the grain I I
[1:43:06] want to I want to become the fullness of
[1:43:07] that grain I want you to work in my life
[1:43:10] God Take Me As I Am renew me change me
[1:43:14] move me help me drop take all the
[1:43:17] greenness out of
[1:43:19] me Let The Waters from under the throne
[1:43:21] as we preach about just just just wash
[1:43:23] over me I don't want to be dead the
[1:43:25] world's dead I don't want to be dead I
[1:43:28] don't want to be caught up in some some
[1:43:30] impersonation of Christianity I want to
[1:43:33] be right I want to live for God let me
[1:43:37] do that Lord could you make that your
[1:43:38] prayer let your head bow like his like
[1:43:40] he said he said if you just bow your
[1:43:42] head in humility and just cry out to him
[1:43:44] Lord I want to come to the grain I want
[1:43:48] to come to the fullness of the word in
[1:43:49] my life I want to be all that you want
[1:43:52] me to be maybe there in some area in
[1:43:54] your life you can think this morning
[1:43:56] that you're just not maybe you you
[1:43:59] slipped in some way and you know what
[1:44:01] the teaching of the message is but
[1:44:02] you've just moved away from it why don't
[1:44:04] you come back to it today why don't you
[1:44:07] just why don't you just in humility say
[1:44:09] Lord make me the grain again let let my
[1:44:11] life manifest the grain let it manifest
[1:44:14] the word and not some man not some idea
[1:44:17] let it manifest the word in my life
