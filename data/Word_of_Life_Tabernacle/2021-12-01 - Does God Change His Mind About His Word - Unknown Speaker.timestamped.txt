[1:29] one time
[1:31] [Music]
[1:56] [Applause]
[2:05] good job buddy
[2:09] how are you i'll tell you some of us
[2:11] good i'm glad to be here anyway i guess
[2:13] you know
[2:15] but uh if you would let's let's open our
[2:17] bibles
[2:18] if we would galatians 1
[2:21] and we'll read the first six verses
[2:23] there
[2:28] i'd like to just talk for a moment
[2:31] about does god ever change his mind
[2:34] about his word i think we know the
[2:35] answer to that
[2:36] but just to go in you'll see down
[2:38] through the
[2:40] uh there's types and things there in the
[2:41] message where brother randall will take
[2:43] different places we'll take where bailey
[2:45] had come along and it seems
[2:48] that uh it seems that men have always
[2:51] tried to change the program of god
[2:54] and sometimes it's not bad men
[2:57] and we get down and
[2:59] go through here a little bit farther i
[3:00] guess we'll get to it but we see balaam
[3:02] there was actually a prophet of god
[3:05] a man of god brother bran talks highly
[3:07] about the man of god
[3:09] but he just listened he was following
[3:11] balak
[3:12] and stood of god as moses stayed with
[3:14] god balaam was going after balak and and
[3:16] after popularity and things of that
[3:18] nature
[3:19] so we'll just go on into the word here
[3:21] if we could for just a moment i'll try
[3:23] not to hold you long
[3:24] i put a timer tonight so i won't hold
[3:26] you long like last time
[3:29] galatians 1
[3:31] and uh i think i said i'm sorry i said
[3:34] the first six verses uh we'll start with
[3:36] verse six
[3:38] i still get a little nervous i'm sorry
[3:42] i marvel that ye are so soon removed
[3:44] from him that called you into the grace
[3:46] of christ unto another gospel
[3:49] which is not another but there be some
[3:51] that trouble you and would pervert the
[3:53] gospel of christ
[3:55] but though we or an angel from heaven
[3:58] preached any other gospel unto you
[4:00] than that which we have preached unto
[4:02] you let him be accursed
[4:04] as we said before so say i now again if
[4:07] any man preach any other gospel unto you
[4:09] than that ye have received let him be
[4:12] accursed
[4:13] for do i now persuade men or god
[4:16] do i seek to please men for if i yet
[4:19] pleased men i should not be the servant
[4:20] of christ
[4:22] but i certify you brethren that the
[4:24] gospel which was preached of me is not
[4:26] after man for i neither received it of a
[4:28] man neither was i taught it but by the
[4:31] revelation of jesus christ and may the
[4:33] lord add his blessings to the word you
[4:35] may be seated
[4:37] will you go through this
[4:39] reading here
[4:41] and you'll see in that brother brandon
[4:42] we'll just go ahead and go on down with
[4:43] this in the church age book brother
[4:45] branham says here it is in galatians 1 8
[4:47] though we are an angel from heaven
[4:49] preach any other gospel unto you than
[4:51] that which we have already preached unto
[4:53] you let him be accursed it was the
[4:55] apostles who brought the original word
[4:56] to the people the original word could
[4:58] not change not even a dot or dash of it
[5:02] paul knew it was god who had spoken to
[5:04] him so he said even if i come and try to
[5:07] give a second revelation try to make one
[5:10] little change in what i gave originally
[5:12] let it be occurred paul himself
[5:14] the messenger to the age couldn't come
[5:16] back and change the word for the hour
[5:20] and see paul knew that the first
[5:21] revelation was correct so god can't give
[5:23] a first revelation then a second
[5:24] revelation if he did he would be
[5:26] changing his mind and he cannot do that
[5:28] being god he said he'd give a revelation
[5:31] then add to it as he did in the garden
[5:33] of eden when he promised the seed to the
[5:35] woman
[5:36] and later designated that seed to come
[5:37] through abraham and then later said it
[5:39] would come by the same bloodlines in
[5:40] david but it was the same
[5:42] revelation it only gave the people more
[5:45] information to help them receive and
[5:46] understand see it is a progressive
[5:48] revelation but it can't change the
[5:51] revelation doesn't change the word of
[5:52] god
[5:53] our understanding can change god's word
[5:55] doesn't change
[5:58] and he says the word come on down the
[6:00] word can't change he said the seed came
[6:01] exactly as revealed and see what those
[6:04] false apostles were doing they came with
[6:06] their own word those ephesians knew
[6:08] that word as paul had taught it they
[6:10] were full of the holy ghost by the
[6:11] laying on of paul's hands they looked
[6:13] those false apostles in the eye and said
[6:16] you are not saying what paul said you
[6:18] are therefore false
[6:20] i tell you
[6:22] look at those false that false anointing
[6:24] doesn't ever stop
[6:26] it'll come right down into the message
[6:27] of the hour it'll teach something new
[6:30] i'll tell you
[6:31] you get into this message and you start
[6:33] to see what it really says and then you
[6:35] go listen to and not maybe not ministers
[6:37] maybe so much but uh you get out and you
[6:40] you see these guys they like their their
[6:42] what do they call them keyboard warriors
[6:44] yeah get online
[6:46] and they're so big you know sitting
[6:48] there on facebook or
[6:50] uh maybe they're got their own website
[6:52] and they're telling you how god has
[6:53] changed his ways he don't have preachers
[6:54] no more
[6:56] you know and he don't have uh he don't
[6:58] believe in the ministry and the pulpit
[6:59] no more i just say it like it is
[7:01] but god's word don't change
[7:03] it was said here recently
[7:05] i guess i'll just get myself in trouble
[7:07] might as well
[7:09] there was a man who said that that
[7:11] brother brandon stopped the five full
[7:12] ministry
[7:19] if he did that that would make him a
[7:20] false prophet he wasn't a false prophet
[7:22] right so when we say what the we say
[7:24] what the messenger of the hour says it's
[7:26] not because he come and changed
[7:28] something it's because he came with the
[7:30] word of the lord so when you see what
[7:33] what paul the apostle came and brother
[7:35] branham stayed with that word and the
[7:37] millions screamed out were resting upon
[7:38] it let me tell you something we are
[7:40] resting on the same promise that he
[7:43] stayed with the exact same word
[7:45] because god doesn't change his mind
[7:47] about his word he may change his mind
[7:49] about you you look at the king that
[7:51] asked for more years seven more years or
[7:53] however many years he asked for and he
[7:54] asked for these more years and god
[7:56] granted it to him and the prophet had to
[7:57] go back and tell him to change his mind
[7:59] and god had changed his mind but when it
[8:01] comes to the word of god he could not
[8:03] change his mind in order to be god and
[8:05] so we'll go on down here in the quote
[8:07] and he said he said there's going to
[8:09] come a prophet in the laodicean church
[8:10] age and you will know if he is the real
[8:12] one sent from god or not for he is of
[8:15] god he will be in that word exactly as
[8:17] god gave it to paul he won't deviate
[8:19] from that word for a moment not by why
[8:22] one excuse me one iota
[8:24] in that last stage when there will be
[8:26] many false prophets appearing watch and
[8:28] see how they keep telling you if you
[8:30] don't believe them and what they say you
[8:31] will be lost
[8:33] see
[8:34] the spirit of fear over the people
[8:36] [Music]
[8:37] but that last day prophet comes on the
[8:39] scene if he is truly that prophet he
[8:41] will be crying out get back to the word
[8:43] or you are lost he won't build on a
[8:45] private revelation or interpretation but
[8:47] on the word
[8:49] so when you hear these these prophets
[8:51] maybe they're true prophets they can be
[8:52] a prophet balaam was a prophet but when
[8:54] they come down and they try to point you
[8:55] to something new some new way of doing
[8:58] things that's not god speaking that's
[9:00] that's a man speaking and interpreting
[9:02] and twisting the word of god
[9:05] and brother branham goes on he says
[9:06] we'll kind of get the outline of the
[9:07] message first he said israel was in
[9:09] their journey coming from egypt he said
[9:11] the lord was with him every enemy that
[9:14] had raised up before israel was moved
[9:15] out of the way for god said he would set
[9:17] hornets before them it would drive out
[9:19] the enemy as long as they walked in
[9:20] obedience to his command
[9:22] the job was never too big the amalekites
[9:25] the giants of the day meant nothing to
[9:27] israel though they were small men in
[9:29] stature but they were walking and thus
[9:31] saith the lord
[9:32] so no matter what the opposition was god
[9:35] always seen that his words of promise
[9:38] had never failed israel and israel of
[9:40] the old testament is a type brother
[9:41] branham says here of the new testament
[9:44] coming up out of the world marching on
[9:45] the road to the millennium
[9:47] and he says we want what the god said at
[9:50] the beginning and anything added to it
[9:52] or taken away from it even your name
[9:54] will be taken off the book of life to
[9:55] add one word to it or take one word away
[9:58] from it and that's not us putting
[9:59] anybody out but that's the word of god
[10:01] staying in his purest form
[10:04] so many people let's say you gotta quote
[10:06] it exactly like it said but then they'll
[10:08] turn around and they'll try to make it
[10:10] say something completely different
[10:12] i'm here to tell you
[10:13] say what he said
[10:15] and it all come out right i i guess uh i
[10:19] was i've been around long enough around
[10:21] the different groups a little bit
[10:22] and they say press play and obey amen
[10:25] obey it do what he said see but the
[10:28] problem is we can sit and listen
[10:31] we can hear what he said but are we
[10:33] actually going to do what he said
[10:36] and that becomes a problem even the
[10:38] scriptures we can read this bible cover
[10:39] to cover and we can say amen to it
[10:42] up here never get it in our hearts
[10:45] we're only reading the pages as they're
[10:48] written we're not reading it with the
[10:49] heart of understanding and we're not
[10:51] actually applying it to our daily lives
[10:54] which that's why we fail so often and i
[10:57] and i'm not pointing fingers at anybody
[10:58] here that's that's me sometimes we have
[11:00] to really dig into that word really
[11:02] believe what it said and not just say we
[11:04] believe it with a head knowledge but
[11:05] actually get into it and believe the
[11:07] word of god with our whole hearts and
[11:09] then act on it
[11:10] he talked about the message hearing
[11:12] acting and receiving you hear the word
[11:15] you act upon it and i believe there's a
[11:17] there's a there's a time when it's okay
[11:19] maybe to sit and just hear the word of
[11:21] god but you have got to come to a point
[11:23] in life where you're ready to go put it
[11:25] in action what you've heard you now got
[11:27] to go do
[11:28] see and that's where i think a lot of
[11:30] times we we fail we stop
[11:33] the church stops you hear something you
[11:34] say i believe that but then you never go
[11:36] into it
[11:37] you never go forward in that in the
[11:39] progression of revelation and he says
[11:42] here
[11:43] he said anything attitude or taken away
[11:45] from it even your name will be taken off
[11:46] the book of life he said we want what
[11:48] thus saith the lord said what the word
[11:50] said
[11:51] but he talks about balaam here for just
[11:52] a moment he said a servant of god balaam
[11:55] many of those men start out and are
[11:57] ordained of god
[11:59] and speak god's word in many things but
[12:02] when it comes to the full truth they
[12:04] won't do it he said notice here as a
[12:06] prophet of god he should not have been
[12:08] caught in such a group as that to begin
[12:10] with he should have went with him but
[12:12] watch for popularity sex see for his
[12:14] conscience sake he said well stay all
[12:17] night i'll try again i'll try again what
[12:19] do you want to try again for he said god
[12:21] already told him what to say god said
[12:23] tell them what you're going that's his
[12:24] original word he said i'm not going and
[12:27] you and don't you go don't you curse
[12:29] what i blessed now watch how it
[12:31] backfired on him he said after a while
[12:33] he said every time he said when god says
[12:35] anything he means it he don't change his
[12:37] mind about it he stays right with his
[12:39] word no matter what anyone says he stays
[12:42] with his word if god ever told the
[12:44] church to get together and have church
[12:45] he still wants us to get together and
[12:47] have church
[12:49] god don't change his way of doing things
[12:52] he ever had a pastor he's still got
[12:53] pastors just because there's a false
[12:55] pastor doesn't mean that there's not a
[12:57] true pastor
[12:59] there's many false prophets going to
[13:00] rise in the last day it doesn't mean
[13:01] there wasn't a true prophet in the last
[13:03] day
[13:04] and that's where we get so caught up
[13:05] we're looking at the false and we see
[13:07] all the maybe the preachers that'll
[13:09] preach something wrong and you'll see a
[13:10] pastor maybe maybe they preach something
[13:13] that's just completely contrary to the
[13:14] word then you just try to put them all
[13:15] in one bunch well this pastor is wrong
[13:17] and that pastor is wrong this missionary
[13:19] or minister is wrong and then you just
[13:21] put them all together but that's not
[13:22] right because god always had a true
[13:26] true preacher in the bible he always had
[13:28] a true apostle in the bible and he said
[13:30] at any time
[13:31] if he ever healed a man at any time
[13:33] through the journey of life let it be in
[13:34] the days of jesus the apostles the
[13:36] prophets whatever it was when the same
[13:38] conditions is met he's got to do it
[13:41] again he doesn't change man changes time
[13:45] changes age changes dispensations change
[13:48] but god remains the same he said he is
[13:51] perfect what a hope that ought to give
[13:53] to sick people if he ever healed a
[13:55] person he has to do it again when the
[13:57] same conditions is met if he ever saved
[14:00] a man how many saved here tonight if he
[14:02] ever saved one of you he's got to do it
[14:04] for somebody else
[14:07] what a hope that gives me
[14:09] the prophet said what i hope that gives
[14:11] me what is it not in some man-made
[14:13] theory
[14:15] not in something of groups of men have
[14:17] come together but is unchangeable word
[14:20] he's and he said you say is it the truth
[14:22] he said let every man's word be a lie
[14:24] and mind be true for heavens and earth
[14:26] will pass away but my word shall never
[14:28] fail
[14:29] all scripture is given by inspiration
[14:32] therefore it's good and profitable for
[14:34] doctrine and he said remember all
[14:36] scripture will be fulfilled every bit of
[14:39] it
[14:40] he's the same god
[14:41] his word don't change
[14:43] amen if he ever
[14:45] if he ever called a man
[14:47] if he ever saved a man if he ever healed
[14:49] a man he could do it tonight you think
[14:51] of the situation take a sister hattie
[14:53] right
[14:54] she said that's nothing but the truth if
[14:56] we can get on that same condition to
[14:58] believe the word and say it's nothing
[14:59] but the truth god can save your lost
[15:01] children
[15:02] god can save your lost family no doubt
[15:04] through the holidays we had some family
[15:06] together that we're praying for but when
[15:08] we get together we get down to business
[15:10] with god god can take a mess and change
[15:12] it he did it in the days of jesus the
[15:14] woman at the well was there in a
[15:16] condition that if she walked in the
[15:17] church would we even accept her tonight
[15:19] but let me tell you you don't have to
[15:21] stay in the same condition because god's
[15:23] word can still take that mess and make
[15:26] something out of it he can still take a
[15:28] street prostitute and make her a
[15:30] daughter of god in the church he can
[15:32] still take somebody who's messed up
[15:34] their marriage and bring that marriage
[15:36] together
[15:37] don't let nobody tell you god's dead
[15:39] because he's still here and he's still
[15:41] doing miracles and i believe we can see
[15:43] him tonight
[15:45] he loved the lord tonight
[15:47] he's the same god he said if his word
[15:49] couldn't be changed by prophets we have
[15:51] no business messing with the word of god
[15:54] paul himself couldn't come
[15:56] an angel from heaven
[15:57] couldn't change the word of god
[16:00] and he said if another angel from heaven
[16:01] did come and try to change it let him be
[16:03] accursed
[16:04] a man may be a prophet a man may be a
[16:07] great preacher
[16:08] but if he tries to change the word of
[16:10] god you don't listen to him is that
[16:12] right because you go back to the word
[16:14] you remember the two prophets and my
[16:17] brother ben has spoke about this there
[16:18] was an old prophet that was sitting
[16:20] there and this young prophet was was
[16:22] sent and told to go to a certain place
[16:24] and he was told don't stop but continue
[16:26] on
[16:27] and this prophet this old prophet told
[16:29] the younger prophet come over and eat
[16:31] with me
[16:33] and the young prophet just out of
[16:35] i guess just just
[16:37] out of out of respect for the old
[16:38] prophet he stopped
[16:40] and he said and ate with him
[16:42] god didn't like that
[16:45] even though he listened to a prophet
[16:47] it wasn't according to the word that god
[16:49] told him to do
[16:50] and that's what we do now it seems like
[16:53] we're so caught up with maybe a
[16:54] personality or maybe because someone has
[16:56] a big name we think we got to hear what
[16:58] they say and that's good
[16:59] as long as they stay with the word of
[17:01] god
[17:02] once a man gets off the word of god you
[17:04] don't have to follow that man down that
[17:06] down that that false doctrine because
[17:08] god's word is true and and if i could
[17:10] stand up here and i might make a mistake
[17:12] and miss miss say a word or something
[17:14] you don't have to follow that or i might
[17:16] say something completely wrong if i got
[17:18] in the flesh for a moment or if i tried
[17:20] to preach in my own words but if god can
[17:22] come and god can vindicate what he said
[17:24] by bringing it to pass it's not me
[17:27] that's vindicated it's the word of god
[17:28] that's vindicated it's not some man-made
[17:31] theology but it's the word of god
[17:33] preaching the power and the
[17:34] demonstration of the holy ghost
[17:36] i think tonight god can still use a man
[17:38] he can still use a woman just as he did
[17:41] in the bible days because i don't
[17:42] believe when the final chapter was
[17:44] written that god died with that i
[17:46] believe that was the time when god said
[17:49] god said i'll raise up a people and
[17:51] they'll do the same thing
[17:54] that didn't stop with our prophet
[17:56] he didn't come just to do all the
[17:57] miracles for himself he come to show god
[17:59] was still alive then so that we can know
[18:01] that god's still alive now
[18:03] god doesn't stop with a certain man
[18:06] passes off the scene but his spirit
[18:08] always remains upon the church
[18:10] if we can just get ourselves in that
[18:12] position to take on the spirit of christ
[18:14] instead of instead of each other's
[18:16] spirits maybe or maybe instead of our
[18:18] pastor or someone else always trying to
[18:20] be like somebody but maybe if we can
[18:21] just get in tune with that holy spirit
[18:23] then we can cast out devils in his name
[18:26] we can raise the dead in his name
[18:29] nothing is impossible with god
[18:32] and we are part of his word
[18:35] we're eternal beings when god saw us in
[18:37] the beginning he knew where we'd be
[18:39] sitting right now and he knew there'd be
[18:40] sickness among us he knew there would be
[18:42] all kinds of problems in this day but he
[18:45] knew we'd be here why because we're his
[18:47] hands we're his feet we are the body of
[18:49] christ in this day
[18:50] don't let nobody tell you you're not
[18:51] good enough don't let nobody tell you
[18:53] that god is dead and god doesn't use the
[18:56] five-fold ministry anymore god still has
[18:58] a five-hole on the earth
[19:00] many is going to fall away many will
[19:02] leave we don't follow after that we
[19:04] follow the word of god but there will be
[19:06] a bride and there will be a
[19:08] many-membered body that will stay true
[19:10] to the word of god and everything that
[19:12] he says can i get an amen
[19:15] some say we don't need the preachers we
[19:17] don't need the church
[19:19] show me where god's word did away with
[19:20] it
[19:23] brother branham never stopped it
[19:24] how are we going to stop it messenger of
[19:26] the age couldn't stop it worse you're
[19:28] not going to stop it
[19:31] i believe here
[19:32] that brother branham when he ordained
[19:34] these ministers he didn't do it just
[19:36] just to do it he did it because he knew
[19:39] that there would need to be ministers to
[19:40] carry on the message of the hour
[19:43] we god can't change the written word and
[19:45] he's not going to change his spoken word
[19:47] and a prophet that would come and say
[19:48] anything contrary to that is not a true
[19:50] prophet if that doesn't that doesn't say
[19:53] it doesn't say that they're i'm not
[19:54] trying to point anybody out but but
[19:57] church we got to come to a point where
[19:58] it doesn't matter what anybody says
[20:00] it doesn't matter what any i don't care
[20:03] how big they are how big their name is
[20:04] it just don't matter what they say if
[20:06] it's not god's word we stay with the
[20:08] word regardless if it's us two us three
[20:10] that's it
[20:11] be the one be the two
[20:13] be those that stay with the word of god
[20:17] brother branham came he came with no
[20:18] ministry of his own he came with a
[20:20] message from the king how many knows
[20:22] that
[20:23] to show christ was still alive the very
[20:25] theme of his campaign jesus christ the
[20:27] same yesterday today and forever
[20:29] the yesterday that walked the earth
[20:32] the same today when he was here on earth
[20:34] and forever that's where we're at now
[20:36] he's still the same god
[20:38] man will change groups will change
[20:40] there'll be doctrines come and there'll
[20:41] be private revelations and
[20:43] interpretations
[20:44] but god's word will never change
[20:46] regardless of all the fanaticism god's
[20:48] word doesn't change
[20:50] there'll be there'll be all kinds of
[20:51] false things that might arise on the
[20:53] scene but god's word still remains the
[20:55] same stay with it
[20:56] the first eve fell why did she fall
[21:00] she left part of the word
[21:02] but he said this second eve this bride
[21:04] would not fall
[21:06] she won't fall why because she'll stay
[21:08] with the word of the hour she'll stay
[21:10] with every word that bride she'll scream
[21:12] out we're resting on it why because
[21:14] we've we've read it we've taken this
[21:16] message we've read our bibles we
[21:17] understand that this prophet didn't come
[21:19] with his own message but he preached
[21:21] exactly what the bible said it only come
[21:23] to open it up to where we could actually
[21:25] see what the word says
[21:28] and we just want to stay into the word
[21:30] stay in the truth
[21:32] no matter what any pastor would say
[21:34] stay with the word no matter what any
[21:36] prophet would say
[21:38] stay with the word
[21:39] brother branham goes on like this he
[21:41] said i want to say this
[21:43] that god never changed his mind his
[21:45] direct will was for balaam not to go
[21:48] but when god makes a statement it has to
[21:50] ever remain true
[21:52] the bible said jesus christ the same
[21:54] yesterday and forever he said that don't
[21:55] mean in a certain way
[21:57] that means he's the same yesterday today
[22:00] and forever
[22:01] he said in saint john 14 12 he that
[22:03] believeth on me the works that i do
[22:05] shall he do also
[22:06] he said is that right he promised in
[22:08] mark 16 these signs shall follow them
[22:11] that believe they say well that was just
[22:13] for the apostles he said go ye into all
[22:15] the world and preach the gospel to every
[22:17] creature these signs shall follow them
[22:19] and all the world to every creature in
[22:22] my name they shall cast out devils they
[22:24] shall speak with new tongues if they
[22:26] take up serpents or drink deadly things
[22:28] it wouldn't harm them if they lay their
[22:30] hands on the sick they shall recover he
[22:32] said now that is his qualification
[22:36] it's not a man's qualification that's
[22:37] his qualification according to the word
[22:40] he said see we try to qualify something
[22:42] we're trying to make qualify the church
[22:44] to what we think god's word is we can't
[22:47] qualify to the church we've got to
[22:49] qualify to god and we know god is his
[22:52] word
[22:53] we go on here
[22:54] brother said heavens and earth will pass
[22:56] away my word shall never pass away what
[22:58] the palmer worm has left has the
[23:00] caterpillar eaten there's something
[23:02] wrong somewhere he said because god's
[23:05] word is just as eternal as he is eternal
[23:09] god's word can no more fall then god can
[23:11] fall himself he said there's something
[23:13] wrong somewhere so let's go back now the
[23:15] background we have laid he said let's go
[23:17] back and take our text of romans 3 4 let
[23:19] every man's word be alive god be true he
[23:21] said i'm going to drive this down and he
[23:23] said i want you to listen let it be god
[23:26] truth
[23:27] let's line up with what god said
[23:29] regardless of what anybody else said he
[23:32] said i want to use four different things
[23:33] he uses four things here in the
[23:34] scripture the insects has eaten off the
[23:37] church
[23:38] of the living god he said the vine of
[23:39] god has crippled or stunted because of
[23:42] these things
[23:43] he said you pentecostals you nazarene
[23:45] you all admit the tabernacle here admits
[23:48] there's something wrong and we the
[23:50] tabernacle is just as guilty as the rest
[23:53] for he that knoweth to do good and do
[23:55] not do it to him it's sin he said now
[23:58] let's go back he said i want to name
[24:00] four things just the scripturals i know
[24:01] how to be that these insects is eaten
[24:03] from the church
[24:05] he said now the first thing the church
[24:06] has was established on the day of
[24:08] pentecost peter preached the
[24:09] inauguration sermon
[24:11] he said when the church was born the
[24:13] christian church was born in the day of
[24:14] pentecost he said if god is
[24:17] infinite and cannot change his church
[24:19] must remain as it was
[24:22] at the beginning he said do you admit
[24:24] that we can say amen to that the church
[24:26] must ever remain the same as it was but
[24:29] man has tinkered with it put their own
[24:31] interpretations in it he said don't you
[24:33] ever try to interpret the word of god
[24:35] say just what it says he said i don't
[24:37] care how it is just line it up with that
[24:40] he said that's all don't change the word
[24:42] the bible said that scripture is not of
[24:43] any private interpretation he said we
[24:45] have no right to say these things we
[24:48] just got to read it and say it just
[24:51] exactly like it says he said and believe
[24:54] it the same way he said i don't care how
[24:56] ridiculous it seems believe it anyhow
[25:00] and he goes on and he talks about the
[25:01] different things that would canker the
[25:03] church he calls it crippling the body of
[25:05] christ in this sermon palmer worm locus
[25:07] cankerwoman caterpillar he talks about
[25:09] how these things will eat at the church
[25:10] little false doctrines little ideas
[25:12] little isms will form in the church he
[25:14] said these things would destroy the
[25:16] church of god not the church of god but
[25:18] with the church in the church you might
[25:20] say the people that claim to be part of
[25:22] the bride of christ it'll sit there and
[25:23] they'll make up little isms and
[25:24] doctrines and they'll go off on this
[25:26] limb over here and then follow after
[25:28] this over here but the truth of it is if
[25:29] you could ever meet god on the
[25:31] requirements of his word then you'll
[25:33] meet him in a place where you can't even
[25:35] you don't even want to go into those
[25:36] other places you don't want to take
[25:37] these little ideas and isms and go off
[25:39] on these things you want to stay with
[25:41] the word of god why because it brings
[25:43] life to the church
[25:45] the word of god is not a dead letter but
[25:47] it brings life back in the church it'll
[25:48] make you shout it might make you scream
[25:50] a little bit it might make you do
[25:52] something crazy in church why because
[25:54] you're excited over the word of god it's
[25:56] not just some emotional workup it's not
[25:58] beating the drums and trying to work
[25:59] somebody up but it's the word of god
[26:01] that brings life
[26:03] and if we can stay true
[26:05] to the word of god
[26:06] i don't believe that satan can even come
[26:08] in and sit here through a whole service
[26:10] where the god word of god is being
[26:12] preached i think he could sit there he
[26:13] might say amen to the word because he
[26:15] knows it's true but he'll sit there and
[26:17] i'll tell you what he might sit there
[26:18] and he will he
[26:20] i've heard a brother say he's the best
[26:21] christian he's god he's there every time
[26:22] the doors are open but let me tell you
[26:24] something we're burning this hide every
[26:26] time we're preaching
[26:28] he gets mad at us when we get up here
[26:30] and preach why because he wants to
[26:31] change just something little he don't
[26:33] mind if you stay home from church he
[26:35] don't mind that at all
[26:37] he don't mind if he said at home and
[26:38] don't fellowship because he said that's
[26:40] when brother brahm talks about he said
[26:41] that's when uh he said that's when you
[26:43] get off to yourself he said that's when
[26:44] the wolf will go after the sheep when
[26:46] they're off by themselves
[26:47] [Music]
[26:48] just remember that you get off by
[26:50] yourself think you're too good to go to
[26:51] the house of god
[26:53] what happens
[26:54] satan will come in there and he'll try
[26:56] to work on your mind and the next thing
[26:57] you know he'll have you in such a
[26:59] condition that everybody at the church
[27:00] is against you
[27:02] yeah
[27:02] you're too good to go to church but
[27:04] apparently the people at the church are
[27:06] too good to have you there
[27:08] and so you're just in this condition to
[27:10] where we satan just works on your mind
[27:12] so much that's his job it's the battle
[27:14] of the mind brother bram said the
[27:15] greatest battle ever thoughts right here
[27:16] in the mind this is the battleground
[27:18] where satan will come and he'll tell you
[27:19] just just leave this little word here
[27:22] you don't have to go to church to be
[27:23] saved
[27:24] maybe you don't but a christian will be
[27:26] a church
[27:29] see we don't put our salvation in
[27:30] anything except for the blood of christ
[27:31] but once you've accepted the blood once
[27:35] you've come under the atonement then
[27:37] you'll your desires will change
[27:40] the life that is in you will want to
[27:41] line up with the life of christ
[27:44] and every time that god has ever sent a
[27:47] his spirit upon the church there's been
[27:49] a revival break out in the people and it
[27:51] was because they were according to the
[27:53] word when when when the pentecostal
[27:55] blessing fell on the church is because
[27:56] they gathered as they were supposed to
[27:58] and they did things exactly according to
[28:00] the word and they waited there they
[28:01] tarried there until the word of god and
[28:03] the power fell upon because they were
[28:06] acting according to the word and if we
[28:08] can act according to the word of god
[28:09] tonight the same god and pentecost can
[28:12] be here with us tonight
[28:14] why because we we just get to thinking
[28:16] we think too much sometimes about
[28:18] ourselves and how hard it is how much of
[28:20] a struggle it is to go to church
[28:22] it is sometimes especially if you got
[28:24] kids sometimes it's hard to go to church
[28:26] it's hard to get him up and get ready
[28:28] devil won't fight you on the other days
[28:29] but he'll fight you on sunday for sure
[28:31] and he'll make it just to where it's so
[28:33] hard
[28:34] but if you'll just push on through that
[28:36] thing
[28:37] take god as at his word just watch how
[28:40] god will move in there and he'll take
[28:42] that trial and he'll make it into
[28:43] something good for you you might might
[28:45] be the best service you've ever been in
[28:47] if you'll just push your way and go and
[28:49] if it's not satan will sit there and
[28:51] tell you see you shouldn't have went you
[28:52] didn't get nothing out of it
[28:55] all they had was a kid up there
[28:56] preaching
[28:59] but if you'll just listen to the word of
[29:01] god god will do something for you
[29:03] and what happens is we get to a point
[29:06] we let satan beat us over the head
[29:08] we let him just get us in such a place
[29:10] we get depressed and we get the feeling
[29:12] like everybody's against us
[29:14] go back to the word of god
[29:16] the word of god i'll tell you it'll
[29:18] it'll soothe every doubt
[29:20] it'll calm it'll calm your soul if you
[29:22] just listen
[29:23] i was sitting there last night and i was
[29:25] listening to a message and and i just
[29:27] got so lost into it my wife had to come
[29:29] tell me it's late it's after midnight
[29:31] you need to probably go to bed you know
[29:33] but
[29:33] you get into that and sometimes it's
[29:35] just so relaxing
[29:36] just to hear the word of god knowing
[29:38] that that's the word of god for you
[29:41] it's not for any other age it's for you
[29:43] and we take that word and we take it and
[29:45] we can just take it in our hearts and
[29:46] and we can act upon it and we hear
[29:48] something and we just say amen to it and
[29:50] sometimes our hearts will just leap for
[29:52] joy when we hear something that we
[29:53] really need to hear it and we just want
[29:55] to get that way about the word you know
[29:57] we get so excited i'm not a hunter but
[29:59] sometimes people get so excited about
[30:01] hunting season and i guess i would too
[30:03] if i was a hunter you know and maybe
[30:06] football or basketball something gets
[30:08] you excited but i think if we could ever
[30:10] get that excitement about the word of
[30:11] god i think god would really move among
[30:14] our services i think god could move in
[30:16] our lives on everyday life if we would
[30:18] just really just you know god inhabits
[30:20] the praises of his people
[30:23] you say i don't feel it praise him
[30:25] he'll be there he'll show up praise him
[30:27] a little bit
[30:28] god will inhabit the praises of his
[30:30] people that's the word
[30:33] and his word don't fail
[30:35] and if his word don't fail why not just
[30:37] step out and claim the promises of god
[30:40] there's no reason for us to be beat down
[30:42] there's no reason for us to to feel like
[30:45] that everything's against us because if
[30:46] nothing else god's on our side if we'll
[30:48] stay with the word of god
[30:51] the test will come the trials will come
[30:54] every son that ever comes to god is
[30:56] going to be tested and tried
[30:58] that's the word
[30:59] but you come anyway you don't come
[31:01] because
[31:01] you don't come because you're looking
[31:03] for some flowery bed of ease as brother
[31:05] branham called it you don't look because
[31:06] it's not a picnic this is a battle it's
[31:08] a battlefield it sure is and it's not
[31:10] going to be easy at times but when you
[31:12] just get into that word
[31:14] you'll have you'll have a rebuttal for
[31:16] every tactic that satan will come with
[31:19] and he'll change his tactics because a
[31:21] lot of times we'll we'll understand that
[31:23] this is satan doing this to us and we'll
[31:25] learn take the word and we'll block that
[31:26] out
[31:27] but he'll come in another way
[31:30] and he'll try to stop you just every and
[31:32] it'll be so subtle sometimes that we
[31:34] won't even catch on and we'll go down
[31:36] and in our lives we'll let something go
[31:37] and we'll let something go i've been
[31:38] there in my life you just let something
[31:40] go i can slip out on a wednesday night
[31:42] every once in a while
[31:44] it's not it's not too easy the first
[31:46] time because you figured well
[31:48] they know i'm not there you know and i'm
[31:49] not talking about people to drive i know
[31:50] when i went to church i couldn't drive
[31:52] from hot springs up here on wednesday
[31:53] night so so i'll give myself an out
[31:55] there
[31:56] but uh but see
[31:58] but if you can if there's a possibility
[32:00] to go we should obey the word of god at
[32:02] all cost
[32:03] and whatever we have to do to be in the
[32:05] position to be able to obey the word of
[32:07] god
[32:08] we don't want anything to hinder us we
[32:10] don't want to work to hinder us we don't
[32:11] want our we don't want to get to a point
[32:13] we're just so busy with our everyday
[32:14] lives we can't go to church
[32:17] because that is an interference with god
[32:19] the devil might like that the devil's
[32:21] going to love that because if he can
[32:22] keep you out of the house of god sure he
[32:24] might make you even very successful to
[32:25] keep you out of the house of god but is
[32:27] it worth it
[32:29] everything you see here is going to
[32:31] perish anyway
[32:33] but there's something down deep inside
[32:34] of a person something in the soul of a
[32:37] man if you could ever get that word
[32:39] anchored in your heart then god will
[32:41] come down and he'll he'll just make such
[32:42] an anchor in your soul and there'll be
[32:44] something in there that'll really get a
[32:46] hole you grab a hold of that word and
[32:48] take hold of it nothing can keep you
[32:50] away from the word of god nothing can
[32:52] keep you from claiming his promises why
[32:54] because god is still god and his word
[32:57] don't change and when you feel the
[32:58] presence of god and i believe this if a
[33:01] man can ever get in the presence of god
[33:03] he'll never be the same again if you
[33:05] could ever get in a channel where god
[33:07] can come down and anoint your life with
[33:09] the holy ghost you can never
[33:12] be out of you can never go too far again
[33:14] because when you try to go god's gonna
[33:16] grab a hold of you he's gonna bring you
[33:18] back to him why because you've accepted
[33:21] him on the faces of his word and if god
[33:23] has ever if god has ever got a hold of
[33:26] your life and it's not us holding god we
[33:28] know that but when god can hold on to
[33:30] you like that you may try to run i don't
[33:32] believe you can if you're a seed of god
[33:34] i don't believe you can go too far
[33:36] you say well it looks like they've they
[33:38] just went too far they've crossed the
[33:39] line
[33:40] if they're a seed of god don't worry
[33:41] about it
[33:42] maybe we don't know if they're seed of
[33:44] god you pray for them you do all these
[33:45] things you try to reach a hand out to
[33:47] people but god's word is true if he ever
[33:51] called someone he's not going to lose
[33:53] them
[33:54] if he ever called them and predestinated
[33:56] them before the foundation of the world
[33:57] if their names are on the book of life
[33:59] he won't lose a one of them i believe
[34:01] that tonight that god's word is still
[34:03] true
[34:04] this morning the pastor was preaching
[34:06] and he was going on and
[34:08] talking about the same holy ghost
[34:10] same holy ghost is still here tonight we
[34:13] don't always feel it like we want to but
[34:15] it's still here
[34:16] we don't go by feeling sometimes we feel
[34:18] like it we feel like heaven's brass and
[34:20] we pray and we don't get an answer
[34:23] god's still there
[34:24] and in his time he's going to answer
[34:26] your prayers
[34:27] in his time he's going to step out and
[34:30] grab a hold of that child that backslid
[34:32] we just as humans sometimes we get
[34:34] impatient
[34:36] there's times i ask god for things in
[34:37] life and then you know i look back on it
[34:39] i think it's probably a good thing he
[34:40] didn't give it to me
[34:41] maybe i wouldn't be able to handle it at
[34:43] the time sometimes he gives us little
[34:45] trials you know test us and see if we're
[34:47] how we're going to react to it
[34:49] are we going to run we're going to just
[34:50] leave the word and
[34:52] say it's too hard to live a christian
[34:53] life
[34:55] it puts me in mind a little story
[34:57] uh brother branham was
[34:58] was preaching and or no it wasn't
[35:00] brother brandon preaching a man was up
[35:02] preaching and he said he's talking about
[35:03] brother brandon's message
[35:05] and he was
[35:06] going on there and he said there's only
[35:07] one problem with brother brandon's
[35:09] message he said nobody can live it
[35:12] a little man in the back stood up he
[35:13] said the bride can
[35:15] and i believe if we can ever get to that
[35:16] point
[35:18] we know that we can live it not by our
[35:20] works
[35:21] not our own merits not because we're
[35:23] good
[35:24] because god has put something in us
[35:27] we're going to fight we're not going to
[35:29] give up we're going to stay on this
[35:30] battlefield why because it's worth it
[35:33] it's worth going all the way
[35:36] it's worth not giving up
[35:38] it's worth grabbing a hold of the
[35:40] promises of god you say well so and so
[35:42] they died with cancer they were a
[35:44] christian it was their time to go
[35:47] but god can still heal cancer
[35:50] and not only can he he will thank you
[35:53] and that's where we have to come to
[35:55] we get so discouraged sometimes we're
[35:57] looking at circumstances you matt you
[35:59] talk about circumstances think about job
[36:02] not you but the other job
[36:05] job he sat there
[36:07] i mean he lost what ten thousand
[36:10] sheep in a day
[36:11] seven thousand camels some number like
[36:13] that that's discouraging
[36:15] that'd be rough
[36:16] he's a wealthy man and he's losing it
[36:18] all losing his wealth and then he lost
[36:19] his ten children
[36:23] and every time a messenger would come
[36:24] running to him the messenger would come
[36:27] the bad news
[36:28] at some point you think job just don't
[36:30] let any more come to you run off go hide
[36:32] somewhere every time these messengers
[36:34] have come well your camels are dead your
[36:36] sheep are dead now your children are
[36:37] gone
[36:38] his wife told him curse god and die
[36:41] look like he ought to give up
[36:44] but he held on to a promise of god
[36:47] because he knew
[36:49] the word was true he didn't even have
[36:51] the understanding that we have in this
[36:52] day and yet he could live through all
[36:53] those trials
[36:55] in this day we've seen god prove himself
[36:57] we've seen god manifest himself time and
[37:00] time again
[37:01] and yet we still seem to get so tossed
[37:04] about by a little trial here and
[37:06] something that will come up over here
[37:07] and i'll tell you church some of you
[37:09] been through things that i maybe i
[37:10] wouldn't be able to handle
[37:12] god knows how much you can handle how
[37:14] much he can allow things to come upon
[37:16] you
[37:16] but i tell you if you'll hold on to the
[37:18] word of god
[37:19] god will not let you go too far if
[37:23] you've got a child that's went so far
[37:24] you think they're gone god won't let
[37:26] them go too far if they're one of his so
[37:28] we rest in the assurance of god we rest
[37:31] in the promises of god we stay in the
[37:33] word of god why because god's word still
[37:36] remains the same
[37:38] he won't change
[37:39] you say you're repeating yourself a lot
[37:41] if we could ever get into our minds that
[37:43] god's word never changes
[37:45] we can really get somewhere
[37:47] because these these false prophets that
[37:49] might be all over the place would come
[37:51] and they say well well this was false
[37:53] and this was wrong
[37:55] you won't even pay no mind to him
[37:57] because you're settled that the word of
[37:58] god is true regardless
[38:01] you're settled it and you know there are
[38:03] good men balaam was such a man he was a
[38:05] good man brother better say he's a man
[38:06] of god
[38:07] a prophet of god he called him yeah
[38:10] but what happened to balaam
[38:12] he just got pulled by the wrong
[38:14] influences
[38:16] he didn't even mean to be that way
[38:18] balaam didn't want to go out and be
[38:19] false
[38:20] he even went down tried to curse the
[38:22] people couldn't do it
[38:24] god still spoke brother said god spoke
[38:27] through
[38:28] balaam
[38:29] god still spoke and god also spoke
[38:31] through a donkey so he can speak through
[38:32] me too
[38:34] god can speak through anybody but when
[38:37] it comes down to it
[38:38] it don't matter who is speaking it if
[38:41] it's not the word it's wrong
[38:42] if it's the word it's right i don't care
[38:44] who's speaking if it's god's word it's
[38:45] true if it's wrong i don't care if a
[38:48] pope or priest or bishop or some prophet
[38:51] is speaking it if they're speaking
[38:52] something contrary to the word of god
[38:54] you always go back to the word of god no
[38:56] matter what comes no matter what tries
[38:58] to influence you in a certain way god's
[39:01] word is the same
[39:03] let me move on down here before i run
[39:05] out of time
[39:08] james 1 22 be doers of the word and not
[39:10] hears only deceiving
[39:12] your own selves
[39:15] we can hear the word we can read the
[39:16] word good things
[39:18] we can listen to the word we have that
[39:20] benefit in our day we need to
[39:22] nothing wrong with that
[39:24] but to do that is just not enough
[39:27] to just sit
[39:29] to sit here in the church i'll take it a
[39:30] little farther sit here and hear your
[39:32] pastor every service that's not enough
[39:35] you can sit there and you say well
[39:37] good sermon good job maybe you can even
[39:40] feel the anointing of the holy ghost
[39:42] upon your flesh but if you go home and
[39:45] live any kind of life then it's not
[39:46] changing you it's just you're just
[39:48] feeling good you feel like i'm going to
[39:50] church i'm i'm you can even do that you
[39:52] can do that for years and maybe you
[39:54] could be content in that state but if
[39:55] you've never grabbed hold of the word of
[39:57] god and acted upon the word of god then
[40:00] what's wrong with church what's happened
[40:02] is that we've just gotten ourselves in a
[40:04] lot of seeing condition a lukewarm
[40:06] condition i'm going to church now i've
[40:08] done a little more i'm kind of doing
[40:09] what the word said but then we get home
[40:11] and we don't live any kind of a
[40:13] christian life why because we wanted we
[40:15] want to fit in we want to fit in with
[40:17] the church people we like the social
[40:19] status but when we get off to ourselves
[40:21] are you still believing the word of god
[40:23] are you still acting on the word at that
[40:24] point
[40:26] if there was no church to go to
[40:29] could you still be a christian
[40:31] could you still
[40:32] believe the word of god if if the
[40:34] churches were shut down they were a
[40:35] little bit there most of our churches
[40:37] were shut down did you sit at home and
[40:40] sit in your pjs with some popcorn
[40:42] and turn on t.d jakes
[40:46] or did you sit there and you just in
[40:48] your heart you wanted to be a church
[40:51] see that's there's there it is it's in
[40:53] the heart
[40:54] a lot of times in the flesh we judge a
[40:56] man by the flesh and how they respond a
[40:58] lot of times and and if you could ever
[41:00] get that word of god in the heart things
[41:02] will change
[41:04] your life will change
[41:06] nothing's going to stop you from going
[41:08] forward in the in the lord if you'll
[41:10] just grab a hold of his promises stay
[41:12] true to the word of god
[41:14] i'll bring this down here we don't
[41:16] follow man-made ideas
[41:18] we may not all see
[41:20] exactly the same glasses
[41:22] we don't see some people have different
[41:24] shades on
[41:26] you may be walking in a time in life
[41:27] where you see a little different
[41:28] revelation that maybe i see
[41:30] i'm young there's men that
[41:32] man they speak something i i'm not gonna
[41:34] go against it unless unless it was just
[41:36] contrary to the word i'll just let it be
[41:38] because they've been in the message so
[41:40] long
[41:41] and you're like they they're so far
[41:43] advanced maybe in revelation than what i
[41:44] could be
[41:46] but you don't just take it just because
[41:48] they're old don't take what they say
[41:51] take everything back to the word of god
[41:53] sometimes we respect an elder we'll
[41:55] respect a man so much you want to just
[41:57] grab hold of everything they say you
[41:59] want to amend everything they say and
[42:01] sometimes that's it's good if they're
[42:03] just preaching the word of god and
[42:04] that's great we should we should always
[42:06] back the word of god that's the cue for
[42:08] you you should always say man to the
[42:10] word of god but see
[42:12] you don't have to just if you're
[42:14] something you're little you're not sure
[42:15] on it
[42:16] don't say amen to that
[42:19] step back and check it with the word
[42:20] it's okay to do that it's okay to filter
[42:23] it's okay to filter a man
[42:25] it's okay to put your filter on
[42:28] even a prophet
[42:31] now we can look back and we've filtered
[42:32] we've already taken our prophet to the
[42:34] bible
[42:35] and we've already seen that he was true
[42:37] so sometimes you can take that off but
[42:39] when you've got another man you say well
[42:40] he's got a gift of a prophet i don't
[42:42] have to filter that be careful
[42:44] you follow a balaam and not know it
[42:47] see and that's where the church gets in
[42:48] a we get in a
[42:50] this condition we get lazy we get lacks
[42:53] and we don't really want to even check
[42:55] it with the word anymore we don't care
[42:57] to check it with the word anymore we
[43:00] must stay with the word and i do believe
[43:01] that it's not just about the emotion but
[43:03] i believe the word will bring
[43:06] a spirit upon the church of love and
[43:08] unity i believe that god will bring a
[43:10] spirit upon the church of rejoicing and
[43:12] joy in the church i do believe that
[43:14] because i don't believe you can sit and
[43:17] listen service after service to the word
[43:19] of god and something not grab a hold of
[43:21] you
[43:22] if you can do that you might want to
[43:24] check up
[43:25] maybe it's time for the altar at that
[43:27] point be like lord make me anew
[43:31] refill me with the holy ghost as our
[43:32] pastor preached this morning i don't
[43:34] care that i received the holy ghost at
[43:35] one time in my life i need it again
[43:38] i need more of god than i did yesterday
[43:40] because satan's more real now he's just
[43:43] as real now as he ever was he'll have a
[43:45] new tactic tomorrow
[43:47] but we should be so prayed up and so
[43:50] into the word of god that when we get
[43:52] out of bed in the morning that we're
[43:54] just ready to face the devil we know
[43:56] he's coming
[43:57] don't lay down and take it get up and
[43:59] fight
[44:00] and i think a lot of times even good
[44:02] christians we get we just get so down
[44:05] and defeated
[44:06] but we shouldn't let the devil do that
[44:08] don't let him steal your joy
[44:10] don't let him steal your peace
[44:13] the word of god is so true if you'll
[44:15] follow after the word of god if you'll
[44:17] get into that word of god hear it
[44:19] receive it and act upon it god can
[44:22] change your life he not only can but he
[44:25] will change your life if you'll just
[44:26] believe the word of god don't let nobody
[44:29] stop you from staying with the word
[44:32] don't matter who it is just don't let
[44:33] nobody ever get you away from the word
[44:35] of god
[44:36] we need to just always stay with the
[44:38] word
[44:40] matthew 24 35 heaven and earth shall
[44:42] pass away my words shall not pass away
[44:45] his words are as eternal as he is the
[44:47] prophet of god tells us and you are
[44:50] part of the word
[44:52] you are an eternal being this is just a
[44:54] space and time to where satan is allowed
[44:56] to fight us and satan is allowed to come
[44:58] at us with all these little tactics and
[45:00] these little darts and i'll tell you
[45:02] it's time the church
[45:04] just really stands up and we quit taking
[45:06] it because there's a there's a saying
[45:08] going around and i like it we're made
[45:10] out of stuff that don't bluff
[45:12] and i think that's the way the church of
[45:13] god needs to be tonight if we could ever
[45:15] get in tune with god get in a place
[45:17] where god can move upon the scene and he
[45:20] can change the outcome of things he can
[45:22] make you in such a way he can make you
[45:24] so powerful over your enemy that when
[45:27] satan comes and he tries to hit you
[45:29] satan will back up and say wow that
[45:31] guy's been on his knees
[45:33] that person's been in prayer they've
[45:35] been listening to the word of god and
[45:36] they've been doing more than listen to
[45:38] it they're acting on it
[45:40] they've put it into action and if that
[45:42] action could ever get a hold and if we
[45:44] can ever get a hold and take that action
[45:46] and just really go with it and run and
[45:48] get in action with the word of god i
[45:50] believe this church can be on so much
[45:52] fire for god that i believe people will
[45:54] come and see what's going on down here
[45:57] every church
[45:58] should get into that atmosphere i
[46:00] believe if we can ever get into the
[46:02] channel of the right atmosphere we won't
[46:04] be comfortable coming to church and just
[46:06] sitting still i believe we'll get into a
[46:09] channel to where god will move so much
[46:10] in our lives i tell you what it's like
[46:12] going to a ball game i went one time
[46:15] and if i sit there
[46:17] i'll tell you something you feel awkward
[46:18] when you're just sitting there yeah
[46:20] everybody's screaming and shouting
[46:22] they're drunk
[46:23] i went in wisconsin they're really drunk
[46:27] hey people i mean
[46:28] it's bad
[46:30] it's fun but it's bad
[46:32] but i got to thinking i did i sit there
[46:34] and i guess you've been raised in church
[46:35] too much when you're sitting at a ball
[46:36] game thinking about church
[46:38] you're sitting there thinking why can't
[46:40] we get this excited
[46:42] we couldn't even see what was going on
[46:44] down on the field
[46:45] we had no idea who caught the ball
[46:48] until the announcer said first down or
[46:50] third down or whatever it was we had no
[46:53] idea what was going
[46:54] on yeah
[46:56] but everybody was on their feet anyway
[46:58] i'll never forget this one i'm sorry i'm
[47:00] down i'm down a rabbit hole here the old
[47:02] man sitting there
[47:04] he's sitting there and he's so grumpy i
[47:06] don't know what he's doing the ball game
[47:07] had no business being
[47:08] there he was sitting right in front of
[47:10] me and they don't have seats like normal
[47:12] stadiums there and they had these
[47:13] bleachers and my knees were in his back
[47:14] i guess
[47:16] and i guess i should have stood up and
[47:17] i'd have made him happy
[47:19] but i sat there my knees in his back and
[47:20] he turned around he said get your knees
[47:22] out my back
[47:23] so i try and i back up and somebody's
[47:25] pushing me forward
[47:27] and people standing up you smell the
[47:28] beer everywhere you know it's like
[47:31] people are excited about this
[47:33] you know
[47:34] how you watch it on tv it's a lot easier
[47:37] don't do that
[47:38] anyway
[47:41] but you get yourself see
[47:44] i don't know where i'm going
[47:46] hang with me for a second i'm coming
[47:48] back
[47:50] but they get so excited over something
[47:52] that has zero
[47:54] meaning
[47:56] they lost that game it's the only loss
[47:58] of the year for the packers at home and
[47:59] i was there
[48:00] people were defeated when they left
[48:02] they'd all been standing up screaming
[48:04] the whole game now they can't talk
[48:06] they're staggered as they walk out
[48:08] yeah
[48:09] there's nothing good come out of it
[48:12] there was nothing good i mean there was
[48:14] no there's no value you might have had
[48:16] fun for a couple hours but you go home
[48:19] and now you're mad you're mad at the
[48:20] refs
[48:22] mad at the quarterback through an
[48:23] interception
[48:25] you're just mad
[48:27] you didn't do nothing good wait in
[48:28] traffic for two hours and all the drugs
[48:30] driving
[48:31] it don't do you no good
[48:33] there's no value in it
[48:35] you come to church there's value in
[48:37] coming
[48:39] what you hear there's value in doing it
[48:42] if that don't excite you then i don't
[48:44] know what will
[48:45] i thought maybe we ought to throw
[48:46] footballs in church maybe that'd excite
[48:48] the people
[48:50] or if they sit real still knock them out
[48:52] with them
[48:56] that's right bless him lord
[49:00] we've got to come to a point where we
[49:01] enjoy
[49:02] our salvation
[49:04] and i believe it comes to a point
[49:07] it comes to a point where we get so
[49:08] caught up in these things of the world
[49:10] and steals our joy from the holy spirit
[49:13] we get to think and i tell you what you
[49:14] get this thing on your mind you
[49:16] you know maybe maybe your work or or
[49:18] maybe you're trying to buy a house or
[49:20] maybe you're trying to buy a new car and
[49:21] you think about it you just overthink it
[49:24] and it tries to steal your joy
[49:27] and you know that's all satan
[49:29] maybe go pray about it before you do it
[49:31] maybe it'll help you
[49:32] maybe you still make a stupid decision
[49:34] you might
[49:36] it's not god's fault if you do
[49:38] but what we've got to come to the
[49:40] realization of
[49:41] is that god's word remains the same
[49:44] regardless
[49:46] of how
[49:48] our father or mother treated us or how
[49:50] our brothers or our sisters were treated
[49:52] sometimes the brothers treat you bad
[49:54] real bad
[49:56] don't matter stay with the word anyway
[49:59] stay with the truth of anyone i mean you
[50:01] just got to come back down come back to
[50:03] the word of god and i believe in the
[50:05] word is where we'll find happiness
[50:08] contentment
[50:09] joy
[50:10] we can shout a little bit when when when
[50:12] the spirit moves among us we should have
[50:14] the freedom it doesn't mean you have to
[50:15] jump and shout and scream all the time i
[50:17] mean that i've been to churches where
[50:19] you couldn't hear nothing the preacher
[50:21] said you left and you felt really good
[50:22] but you really had no idea what was said
[50:25] but there should be a joy when the word
[50:27] goes forth and when the spirit of the
[50:30] lord comes upon the people there should
[50:32] be such an expectation from you to
[50:35] receive the word that when it comes
[50:37] forth and it blesses your heart you
[50:39] should be able to stand up and say amen
[50:41] you ought to be able to stand up and
[50:43] shout why because god's word is moving
[50:45] upon your heart and when and
[50:48] as the pastor said almost said the
[50:49] prophet said as the pastor said this
[50:51] morning you know when when when mary
[50:53] conceived there wasn't much emotion but
[50:55] when she gave birth
[50:57] she knew
[50:58] she gave birth
[51:00] because when a birth happens there's
[51:01] going to be something take place and i
[51:03] believe when that when we come in and we
[51:05] get that feeling of the holy ghost
[51:06] something's going to grab hold of us and
[51:08] we may not feel it immediately but we've
[51:10] we've gotten the holy ghost and we
[51:11] change as he was saying this morning and
[51:13] then we go on and we get that refilling
[51:15] but i believe as you get more soft and
[51:18] you get more maybe your heart is
[51:20] hardened at some time in your life and
[51:21] you kind of really let your heart just
[51:24] soften up to the things of god i believe
[51:26] god can then really move in your life
[51:28] and i believe maybe it'll make you cry
[51:30] you say well i'm embarrassed to cry in
[51:31] church i'm embarrassed to shout in
[51:32] church quit thinking about those around
[51:34] you and praise god anyway
[51:37] it don't do you any good we don't come
[51:40] we come to fellowship with each other
[51:41] but you don't come to to hope so and so
[51:43] gets blessed
[51:45] i mean you want everybody to get blessed
[51:46] but you don't come and your salvation
[51:48] doesn't depend on the person next to you
[51:51] and neither should you're shouting
[51:54] you stand up do i have a wrinkle in the
[51:56] back of my suit
[52:00] do i sit on some gum
[52:02] shouldn't have the gum anyway we get so
[52:05] carnal
[52:06] we get so caught up in our little
[52:08] personality quirks i guess you might say
[52:11] we're just scared to take god at his
[52:13] word and step out on it why because we
[52:15] get so we get so battered with life we
[52:18] get so beat up and all these things just
[52:20] come against us what happens we just get
[52:23] beat down and we feel like we can't
[52:24] praise god no more the devil don't like
[52:26] no praising god around here
[52:29] i don't care what the devil don't like
[52:31] brother stewart i don't care what the
[52:32] devil don't like
[52:34] we should praise god with all of our
[52:36] might we should praise him with
[52:37] everything in us when we get up in the
[52:39] morning praise god anyway
[52:42] and i'm going to skip through some of
[52:44] these because i've taken too much time
[52:48] my football story got out of hand
[52:50] it's time to take god at his word and
[52:52] get in action
[52:54] this one let me read this to you real
[52:55] quick
[52:56] and we'll bring it to a close brother
[52:58] brown was talking here he said moab seen
[53:00] israel
[53:01] something they didn't have they seen a
[53:02] mighty power amongst israel
[53:04] it was a prophet
[53:06] he said that prophet was moses
[53:09] he said and they know that when the
[53:10] battle went wrong they just raised up
[53:12] his hands held them up there and the
[53:14] battle changed
[53:16] i like that
[53:17] hold up your hands sometimes
[53:19] you've got that same power in you so
[53:21] that was just moses no that christ is in
[53:23] you there's power in raising up your
[53:25] hand
[53:26] there's power and when you say amen to
[53:28] the word of god
[53:30] he said they didn't
[53:31] held his hands up there and the battle
[53:33] changed he said they didn't have such as
[53:34] that so he said they try to match it
[53:36] with politics with a political pull
[53:39] he said they sent over to another
[53:40] country and hired a prophet to come over
[53:43] he said they could have a prophet
[53:45] would have power amongst them just like
[53:46] israel had among them
[53:48] he said do you see the carnal comparison
[53:51] can you see the carnal church today it's
[53:53] done the very same thing he said notice
[53:56] now they're both going to have prophets
[53:58] the only difference was moses the
[54:00] prophet of god his king was god
[54:04] and that's where he got his orders the
[54:06] word of the lord balaam he also he had a
[54:09] king and that king was balak the king of
[54:12] moab he said that's where he got his
[54:14] orders
[54:15] and his or and his blessings so moab
[54:19] said to balak come down or balaam said
[54:21] come down and curse me this people for
[54:23] they cover the whole face of the earth
[54:26] they just come and lick up everything
[54:28] like an ox licks up the grass said come
[54:30] down here and i understand that you can
[54:32] curse you can bless whatever you do is
[54:33] recognized
[54:35] that's true
[54:37] whatever he was a prophet what he did
[54:39] was was thought highly of in this time
[54:42] but he was hired he wasn't sin of god he
[54:44] said now we want to notice that this man
[54:46] was a prophet ordained of god but he
[54:47] sold his birthrights for political
[54:49] reasons just as the church did today
[54:52] like luther wesley pentecost and the
[54:54] whole group of them sold it out for
[54:55] polls in their organization
[54:57] moses under god balaam under balak yet
[55:00] both prophets were called man of god
[55:04] both spiritual notice the difference
[55:07] each had a head moses was god balaam's
[55:09] was balak he said notice here how the
[55:11] spiritual is applied to prove that the
[55:13] natural is wrong moses sent of god in
[55:16] line of duty is met and challenged by
[55:17] another prophet of god he said can you
[55:19] imagine that moses called of god
[55:21] ordained of god standing in the duty of
[55:24] god moved up into this cold formal group
[55:27] and was challenged by another prophet of
[55:29] god what god had blessed and ordained
[55:32] how would you tell the difference now
[55:34] listen to this
[55:36] they both had prophets
[55:39] god spoke to both prophets
[55:42] and i just love how he takes this down
[55:43] here he said some of them say well god
[55:45] said do this god said do that he said i
[55:48] don't question that but it's out of the
[55:50] line of god's word the prophet no matter
[55:53] if he is a prophet he's out of line
[55:56] he said so many people get deceived like
[55:58] that he said oh this brother can do this
[56:00] and this brother can do that and deny
[56:02] the word
[56:04] he said though i speak with tongue of
[56:05] men and angels though i have gifts that
[56:07] i can move mountains though i give all
[56:09] my goods to feed the poor
[56:11] i am yet nothing
[56:14] church we don't follow after another
[56:16] person the word of god
[56:18] christ jesus that's the person we follow
[56:20] and he is the word and that word has
[56:22] come down as musicians would come i'll
[56:24] be closing here and as this word would
[56:27] come down and just penetrate the heart
[56:29] if we'll just really grab a hold of that
[56:31] word
[56:32] god is really god can do something for
[56:34] you he can move on your life we don't
[56:36] follow after a false prophet this
[56:38] message that we've gotten we hold so
[56:40] dear to is a vindicated word message of
[56:43] the hour
[56:44] it's all true

[56:47] hold your hands up in the hour of
[56:50] struggle and tribulation and times of
[56:52] trial hold your hands up to god praise
[56:54] him anyway
[56:56] as i said god inhabits the praises of
[56:58] his people

[57:44] but if it's not the word of god leave it
[57:46] alone

[57:49] god and when that word of god will
[57:51] really when it really comes into us we
