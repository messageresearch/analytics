nameen amen amen Genesis 17: 9-1 Genesis 179 we're going to have communion tonight I'm looking forward to that we haven't had it in a couple months just circumstances we're going to do it tonight there's some missing but we'll do it again in in a couple months as we normally do um I'm going to be gone for a little while 10 days or so but uh if youall need me of course you can contact me you usually would but we're going to Lord willing go out of town for a little while and go to camp in Ohio and do some other things as well but uh I'm looking forward to the ministry we've got coming in and I'm want to miss brother George but we'll watch that but then uh brother Matt Watkins going to be in I don't believe he's ever been here and preached at the church I think that's going to be a real blessing to you so we're looking forward to that good to see everyone in the house of the Lord this morning Romans chapter 4 I'm sorry Genesis chapter 17:9 we're going to go to Romans 4 next after you're seated Genesis 179 God said to Abraham Thou shalt keep my Covenant therefore th and thy seed after thee in their Generations this is my Covenant which you you shall keep between me and you and thy seed after thee every Manchild among you shall be circumcised you shall circumcise the Flesh of your foreskin it shall be a token of the Covenant betwix me and you pray the Lord would add his Blessing to the word you may be seated as we followed Abraham in his journey of faith we found that he'd been called out of er the caldes he'd been separated from his Brethren he seen the promise confirmed with signs and wonders it's had Jehovah reveal himself as El Shai now his faith must be recognized by an irreversible seal in his flesh a token of the Covenant in Romans chapter 4 Paul deals with uh circumcision what it is and what it isn't and he makes the argument that it wasn't the act of circumcision that was was the uh what Justified Abraham but it was actually circumcision was a seal of his faith that he had and so it was faith that actually saved Abraham Romans 4:1 what shall we say then that Abraham our fathers pertaining to the flesh has found for If Abraham were justified by works he ha where of to Glory but not before God for what sayith the scripture Abraham believed God and it was counted unto him for righteousness now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of Grace but of debt in other words if if you get in based on your works then then you it's because God owed you something and God do will owe nothing to anyone right he's not going to owe anybody and so our works are even the Bible says our righteousness is like filthy rags but he says it's not reckoned of Grace but of debt but to him that worketh not but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly his faith is counted for righteousness even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man un whom God imputeth righteousness without works saying blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin I believe that's us today the Lord will not impute sin to his elect yes to those who believed on him he said cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only or upon the uncircumcision also for we say that Faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness how was it then reckoned when he was in circumcision or in uncircumcision he said not in circumcision but in uncircumcision other words before he was circumcised he received the sign of circumcision so circumcision was not the beginning of Abraham's faith it was the end of it it was it was God saying that his faith was real a seal notice that word a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had had yet being uncircumcised that he might be the father of all them that believe though they be not circumcised that righteousness might be imputed unto them also and the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only but who also walk in the steps of that Faith of Our Father Abraham which he had yet being uncircumcised for the promise that he should be the heir of the world was not to Abraham or to his seed through the law but through the righteousness of Faith so he's saying that circumcision is not what saved Abraham it was the Seal of his faith it was proof of the Covenant that God made if you're going to go to heaven it's going to be because God picked you he called you he he he oh he he woed you he he brought you he he changed your mind he he brought you to a place in him that you could go that you would be worthy he made you worthy to go and so we realize that's all God right there's nothing we have to do in that but yet if we have that if we are that person if we have that kind of Faith to believe God if he's placed that dep positive faith in our life there's got to come a time where he seals us or he he actually gives us proof of the Covenant that's what circumcision was to Abraham it was proof of the Covenant now I know there's many people might ask well why do I need the baptism of the Holy Ghost why isn't it enough that I'm a Believer isn't it enough that that I say well well I I believe the message I believe uh what brother Ben says I believe the preachers I I believe the Bible isn't that enough well if you really believe God seals that Faith with the Holy Ghost and so you find that if if you don't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and yet you're relying on Election you're relying on on faith you you'll realize that you you've you've misapplied something because if you really had faith and you're an elected seat of God and you've repented fully of your sins you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost so brother brandom he went through a time and he told it many many times in his ministry where he talked about the dean of a Lutheran School Who challenged him on why he needed the Holy Ghost and and the man told him he said isn't faith enough isn't faith enough it's a great question and he and brandham told him but or he told brother brandham but Abraham believed god brother brandham and it was imputed to him for righteous because he believed what more can a man do but believe good question right what more can a man do but believe I said it's all a man can do right that's all a man can do that's all Abraham could do it's all you can do this morning is Bel he said it's all Abraham could do he said it's all a man could do you believe and accept Christ as a personal savior that's your faith but remember God gave Abraham a seal of circumcision as a confirmation of his faith so it's not just believing but it's being it's God saying you believe it's not just me saying I believe but it's God saying you believe that's right are you with me now now he said but Abraham believed God was isn't that enough now and and I said then that was the Old Testament in the New Testament when we say we believe he said God gives us the baptism of the Holy Ghost which is a seal of Confirmation and I'll say this without it you're not sure without it you you'll draw back without it when the tough times come you you you you'll you'll Wilt like a flower in the summer heat you won't be able to to press on you won't be able to make it especially the age that we live him because you don't have what it takes you're not really sure without the baptism of the Holy Ghost but with the baptism of the Holy Ghost you can prove and I'll say this you other people may not believe it but you can still prove it it's been proved to you in your own life that your faith was effective because you received the baptism of the Holy Ghost so now he said he said Ephesians 4:30 says grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you're sealed until the day of your Redemption see it's a seal that God has recognized your faith but if he hasn't given you the Holy Ghost yet he's never recognize your faith now it's real important church if you don't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost this morning and I won't take a a show of hands but but I know there'd be many maybe that would wonder and do I really have it and and sometimes a person can have it and wonder about that we know that's true but I'd say for most of us we had a definite experience with God we know we receive something from God yet the devil will attack you on that he'll try to make you think you're not saved when you are and he'll try to make you think you are saved when you're not but yet most of us I think we we've had a definite experience with God we know we have it and yet if you don't have it you say but but I'm a Believer brother beny you're right you are a Believer I don't want to minimize the the believing in your life but you haven't believed enough yeah that's right church I I take that from a quote I don't have it with me this morning brother B said your faith wasn't strong enough you haven't believed enough there hasn't been uh there's something that's got to happen in your life where Beyond it's not just me saying I believe but I've I've surrendered everything to God I've completely given up myself to God I'm a I'm a I'm a vessel being willing I've been Justified and Sanctified and I'm willing to serve him and when I get in that condition then God fills me with the Holy Ghost but you believe you say well I believe but I but I just don't know about that Holy Ghost you don't believe in us right because if you really believe God confirms that faith if you believe like Abraham believed God seals you with the Holy Ghost so if you don't have it what do you do what can I do what more can a man do believe believe fully but that's more than just saying I believe but it's when you when you believe it it produces an action in your life you get under the message of the hour you get under the token you you become under the blood you begin to act like a Christian walk like a Christian you believe and God seals that and and Peter said the same in Acts 238 Peter said repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost if your faith is right God will confirm it right and and it's not like you say well I'm not perfect brother Ben I must not have it it didn't never say you'd be perfect said you'd be sealed right he never said that you'd never make a mistake he said you'd be sealed and to be sealed means you can't be lost right oh that's something we ought to want on it's not something scary it's not something that out there somewhere that well the Pentecostals have but we can't really have it no no it's something we should want it's the literal Life of Christ living in you where you couldn't you couldn't leave this message if you wanted to why because there's something inside of you that's sealed you we talked about Wednesday night a mainspring something inside that that has made you uh do what you do and you don't do it to you don't pretend to be a Christian anymore but you are a Christian yeah so he said God recognized Abraham's Faith he believed God it was imputed to him for righteousness that's true but then God gave him the seal circumcision as a signed to him not that his flesh circumcised had anything to do with his soul but it was a sign that God had recognized his faith and he gives us the sign of the Holy Ghost that he has recognized us as Believers again he said now when we receive Christ as our savior and if we're sincere in that that that's that's important if we're sincere in that then God gives us a sign that he has received our faith in Christ by giving us the Seal of circumcision which is the Holy Ghost I don't believe you have to wait for years and years to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost I don't believe you have to wait one minute right if you really believe yeah you can receive it yes in fact there's places in the in the New Testament where they even received it before they were baptized because God knew they would go and get baptized right and so God confirmed their faith because their faith was so strong that even when they heard the word the the Holy Ghost fell on him right then what is it I believe he can fall on you this morning while you're hearing the word the Holy Ghost can come down on you fill you with the Holy Ghost yes oh my what it's a seal it's something that you know it happened to you and again the devil tried to talk you out of that but don't listen to him you just believe it now he said uh that's the Seal of circumcision grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you're sealed to the day of your Redemption not to the next meeting but to the day of your Redemption if you say oh I'm a Believer and God has never given you the Holy Ghost yet he's never recognized it you're just confessing that you believe he said but when all the doubt he said I'm not saying you're not a Believer now in a certain portion you are a Believer right so all of you this morning I believe in a certain portion you're a Believer but if you haven't received the baptism of the Holy Ghost right then then you haven't believed in us in a certain portion you're a believer but when God has found fa or you found favor with him he recognizes you to be his child and he knows your heart and he sees your sincerity he knows all things are cut away from you see this is why I don't believe you got to work your way up to it you say well if I could quit this and quit that and quit that but it's not working your way God knows that moment when you're at the altar that moment when you're home kneeling by your bed that moment when you're hearing the word and suddenly in your heart you say lord it's over I'm done with this stuff I'm I Repent Lord and that moment you can receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost why because he recognizes your sincerity he knows you mean it when you repent he knows you're going to do everything you can to walk away from it and listen you can't do it by yourself you need a Helper and so he brought a helper he he sent his own life back to you to help you through life amen so you got to have the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said he said if you you say I'm a Believer God has never give you he said you you're just confessing but he said when God has found favor he said then he seals you into the kingdom of God by the Holy Ghost proving to the world he has accepted now listen what faith you profess to have in him so it's not just me saying I believe but it's him saying him recognizing my faith in Acts chapter 7 and verse 6 it it tells the story of how uh that God brought abraam out God spake on this wise that his seed should sourn in a Strange Land remember God told Abraham this that they should bring them into bondage and treat them evil 400 years and the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will I judge said God and after that shall they come forth and serve me in this place and he give him the Covenant of circumcision so Abraham begat Isaac and circumcised him the Eighth Day and Isaac beat Jacob and Jacob beat the 12 Patriarchs so then we know that Joseph then is sold into slavery and they were removed from the land of promise all of those years yeah here God had given the promise to Abraham but he said you're not even going to be in the land of promise for 400 years but now he said you're going to come out we talked about it a few weeks ago with a great substance and Moses wouldn't take anything less than that so he said you're going to come out with your flocks with your herds with everything that you've got now so they had a promise that Egypt would be judged and they would come forth with great substance there now in when Moses came and we know Moses was a a a messenger with a message of Deliverance when he came there were people there were Jews there in that land who had carried the Covenant of circumcision down to that age they they they had as a nation they kept that but yet they did not believe Moses message right right and God was fixing to give them a different token y then circumcision to say who could go over and who couldn't but the brandom calls it separating the bride from the church right he was going to separate the elect from the non-elect separate those who would hear the message and those who wouldn't and the way that he would do that because to Abraham it was the Covenant of circumcision but yet there were circumcised Jews who did not believe Moses message right they were Jews they could prove it their firstborn though would still die in the in the plague because the token changed from circumcision to Blood on the doorpost you all know the story right and exodus 12:13 it says and the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where you are so it's no longer a sign in in our physical flesh but now it was a sign of Blood on the doorpost a physical Blood Brother BR said blood like paint they would take the blood like paint and paint the doors the post of the door and the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where you are and when I see the blood I will pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when I smite the land of Egypt now watch how God changed the Covenant or or or the Seal of it he didn't change the Covenant but he changed the seal of it he changed the token of it and it was no longer circumcision alone but now it had to be a person who they could be circumcised but that wasn't enough it had to be someone under the Blood Brother BR said get the point now the Jews no matter how much they could prove that they were circumcised but the token had to be showed if not there the Covenant was not effective it wasn't same now same thing no matter what you do oh I want to I want to convey to you this morning the importance of it yeah I I want to preach to you in a way that you'll understand what what how a solemn this is and how important this is especially in the hour that we live in you young people it's the Holy Ghost isn't optional right right right it's it's life or death it separates those who go in the Rapture from those who go in the tribulation period right and some of y'all come to church and I appreciate that and all of us do and I'm not trying to dechristianize anybody but if you don't have the Holy Ghost Now's the Time to get it it's it's not enough just to come to a church and hear brother Ben preach it's not enough just to sit there and be raised in the house of God be raised in a Christian home you must receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost you've got to have the token and so he said the same thing no matter what you do no matter how much you can explain the Bible you might be a Bible student you might say I'm a Believer in everything but still the token is required I know that's changed today people say well you can just go do this or that or go to the certain meeting go to a certain Camp go to a certain Church uh uh listen to a certain tape and that's the token that's nonsense right the token is way more than that it's way more important than that what is it it's a it's a life that comes inside of you and lives through you now he he said now you're under the spirit under the Holy Spirit you're under the holy spirit so you can feel the effects of it you believe the message of the day how many believe the message I don't believe we should be ashamed of that you believe the message some of you uh I don't want to get off here but some of you have uh have experiences with people who were in the meetings some of you may have have had uh we had a lady here during the meetings who was called out on a tape and she told me the tape and where it was and I went and found it and there's people all over this area that were called out sister Alexander and we knew sister Brown different ones were called out and and you could see it was proof that God knew the secrets of the hearts you believe the message I believe there's ever message Believers that that you are that you believe the message today but see believing the message is not enough I know people will fight you on that but it's it's true it's not enough it w't you can believe the message I know people who believe the message who don't live it at all but they'll tell you they believe it they won't hear nothing against the prophet right they won't hear nothing against brother Brandon but they didn't believe in us right right they believe but they didn't believe in us they may believe enough to listen to a tape but not enough to do what he said I remember a family in in the Dyersburg area they were wonderful people and yet but they had vices and things in their life and they didn't go to church and every once in a while they'd show up but but that family that more they believe this message they would stand for this message they'd listen to it and I had a young man confess to me he said you know he said I could listen to to a tape while smoking cigarettes and stand there smoking cigarettes and a prophet preach against it and amen it and say it was true but what did he need he needed more than just a an acknowledgement that it was true he needed the token itself today that young man still believes this message but he don't live it are you with me now well we don't want to do that we want to be more than just blessed good you we need to believe the message but we want more than that he said you under the Holy Spirit you believe the message of the day you believe the power the pillar of fire you believe that see and you do he said now look just to believe it is not enough oh Church to walk around where it's at isn't enough right well that's to make yourself worse he said for he that knoweth to do good and doeth it not to him it's sin yeah so at some point it becomes a problem because you're hearing it preach and you're not doing anything you're hearing right right at some point that's a problem and there comes a hardness and a coldness like Pharaoh hearing before Pharaoh heard Moses message he he didn't have hardness in his heart like he did afterwards but as Moses continually came Pharaoh's heart was hardened by the message by proximity to the messenger oh my now look he said to believe it's not enough to walk around where it's at isn't enough that's to make yourself worse he didn't know to do good to do it do it not to him in sin he said apply it church now don't fail he said will you now I I'll ask you that question this morning you said but brother Ben I I know i' I've had the Holy Ghost well it's time to put it on display right time to apply it in our lives he said don't let the sun set don't don't don't rest day or night don't take no chance it won't work children it won't work you must have the token all right yes you say I believe yes I go I yeah I believe the message that's all right that's good but you must have the token he said do you hear brandom Tabernacle you must have the token displayed oh my without it all you're believing is in vain listen that they gotten so carnal they they set up a a token tape and put that in and say well that's the token in your house no it's not because if your house burnt down you'd lose your token if your house flooded you'd lose your token but this token can't be lost it's a seal to the day of your Redemption you couldn't deny this message no matter what they did to you why it's a token it's a seal no matter what you go through you'll go through trials you'll go through troubles you'll have situations in life every one of you Elders can speak to these younger people and say your life is going to be difficult there'll be a tough road up ahead but you got to have something that'll keep you something that'll keep that clock ticking around there's got to be a seal in your life a token that God says this is a Believer this is my child yes sir and that's what it'll keep you yeah good understanding it's never going to keep you it's a good thing to understand that's never going to keep you right takes his life inside of you you say I believe I go but you must have the token said without it all you're believing is in vain yeah he said you'll live a good life you listen to what the word says you go to church you try to live right that's fine but that's not it when I see the blood that's the token again and I'm taking these things from the token message by the brand preach in September 1963 he said don't just come this far and say I believe the message you obey the messenger well we can stop there for a while see a prophet warning I believe there was a there's a spirit on the earth yeah because if Satan can't get you to deny the message and say it's false he'll get you to accept it and not obey it right that's the next step that's that's the next best thing in fact Satan would almost rather you do that because then you'll be deceived you won't be looking for nothing else right so he trying to get you to deny it but if you can't get you to deny it he'll get you to accept it but he'll he'll get you to accept part of it a portion of Faith right and just stay there but you can't stay there and I believe the elect will go on into salvation he said now he said you obey the messenger coming to Christ you say well I believe every word said brother Brandon that's good but that's just being able to read even you know a person with sense ought to be able to believe serpent seed you can explain that logically to people a person with sense ought to be able to believe in in Jesus name baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ a person just has a head knowledge could explain that but the random said it didn't even take Revelation to believe that right because it's so clear right just a person with sense ought to be able to do it and that's what's happen sometimes preachers without the Holy Ghost but they got a lot of head knowledge a lot of sense yeah right and and and they preach it and it comes across and people believe it oh church but we need more than that we need more than that we need the life of that within us but he said don't just say you say well I believe every word said you say well that that means I have the baptism of the Holy Ghost I I think you you know an Evidence the evidence of the Holy Ghost is is believing the word of your day but it's not just it's not just a mental Ascent to that word it's not not just saying I believe it but believing is like Abraham are you with me now you got to follow in the footsteps of Abraham and so if you believe the word you follow the word to baptism you follow if you believe what acts 238 says you follow him to baptism if you believe this message is true you'll start listening to it right right if you believe that this that that that you ought to go assemble yourself together you'll come to church right if you believe if you really believe you say well I believe and you don't do it well it shows that you didn't really believe your faith wasn't strong enough oh but we need a strong faith today to be like Abraham not just say well I believe every word said but there's a comfort to that with some people they say well I believe everything brother BR said Is is true and so uh that that means I must have the Holy Ghost no it must be the life inside of you that repeats that word back oh my because you say every word well maybe you haven't heard every word are you with me now but there might be a person who's got one page of one book but they've got the Holy Ghost right when we were in Egypt we realized the whole world doesn't have the message right right and what they have sometimes is translated in a way that don't make a lot of sense but if they could get one that gets the Holy Ghost and teach that one it would begin to spread I hope they're hearing me I know some of our Egyptian Brothers in fact I think brother mcgall was listening today a a and and you need one person sir in a country to get on fire for God sir one person could change Egypt it's happened before huh Moses went down one person went down into Egypt and made a difference one person with the baptism of the Holy Ghost could make a difference in that country where people are hungry and wanting to receive the word I've been there I've seen it one person will think what one person with the baptism of the Holy Ghost could do in your home you may not have every word or every every jot and every TI but you've got the Holy Ghost and so whatever word you do have you believe us having the word like we do we got it all on our phones we got it all on our tablets we got it all on our computers what does that do it makes us responsible to it we become responsible to it oh a church if could just get the Holy Ghost with that are you with me now one person can change your family don't let the devil lie to you say well it's too late that they're too far gone they've turned against the message or to now one person with the baptism of the Holy Ghost that really gets on fire for God I'd like to see one young person in this church really get on fire for God and begin to serve God with all their heart one young person could change a youth grou One Pastor one preacher that really gets on fire for God can change I've realized it's not how much I preach or how long I preach but it's what I do with the time that I've been given let me be a burning fire oh God that we would be a burning fire in our community One Church could change Hardy change the reputation and everything are you with me now the way things are say well it's just always going to be that way it don't have to be come under the token all right death is everywhere right the death angels all over the land but come under the blood come under the token and see if it doesn't work I was asked what what do you do if somebody comes to you and they try to tell you oh this isn't true or you shouldn't go to church you shouldn't do this that or the other I said just tell them it works it produces something in your life it produces families it produces a church it produces God in your lives right I challenge you to believe it amen chall you to believe it until you're baptized I challenge you to believe it until you're filled with the Holy Ghost right challenge you young people to believe it and run your homes that way don't don't take it by your own opinion but F let let follow the word of God for the hour follow the message of the hour don't even take my opinion follow the message of the hour get under the token let the Holy Ghost lead you and guide you it'll change your family history it'll change your life challenge you to believe it you sitting there with doubt and worried well this man might mislead me this one might do that I challenge you to believe what God says take the message he said take it into your heart oh how many have it in their heart today I trust you take it in your heart that you must have the token the very life that was in Christ to be in you when I see that all pass over you Brandon begins to tell them about the end time signs and stuff and I know sometimes you you I know some of you wonder brother Ben why don't you preach more on end time signs why don't you preach more on the mark of the beast and things that are coming and and brother brandom answers that in the token message because there's the there there's many things that are going on right now I believe are fulfillment of Prophecy but what God is doing right now is the token yeah I hope you're hearing me today that's what God's going to do in the tribulation period what he's going to do with the Jews what he's going to do right he he's going to he's going to there's going to be many things done after we leave here and then prophecy will be fulfilled but for our part we're at the end time he said look he said I don't see nothing left now people can try to take that and say well brother BR said all right this Trail against that must mean something mysterious or something like that how you can't make that fit with this right if you're going to take it literal you can't make it fit with this I don't see nothing left you say what about the mark of the beast those who reject the holy spirit is already marked by the Beast you say there something coming absolutely sure there's a system there that's all that will come but BR said in literal form but it's already here in spirit it's been here since since Jesus left when the Catholic Church first started and they began to charge for novenas and charge for for salvation but he said touch not the oil and the wine the mark of the beast is always been here and and I've seen a theology lately and I hope it don't touch us but we're influenced by these things in a way maybe in the past we wouldn't have been I've seen this theology that Revelation uh really matters to the church in this sense that the Rapture what they're saying is there's not really a rapture we just all go through the tribulation period so everybody get ready I'll say this they probably will but that's not the message right the message is those who receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost are like the Israelites under the token under the blood they we go home we're not getting ready to to to make it through the tribulation we're going home and he said you say what about the mark of the beast those who reject the holy spirit's already marked by the the Beast the punishment will come later and brother Brown goes into that and he explains that when Jesus was here he only read that part of the scripture pertained to the day he was living in remember he said he said uh to bind up the Brokenhearted the Lord has anointed me he said to have bind up the Brokenhearted and all of these things and when he gets done he said this day the scripture is fulfilled but he closed the book and didn't finish the chapter in fact he stopped right in the middle of a verse why did he do that he said the rest related to his second coming right he said so he was preaching the message for that day and brother B deals with that and he says he said now this is what he's going to do today this is what he is speaking through his anointed Spirit to the church today now is the hour now is the time receive it people receive it what is what is he speaking receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost receive the it'll be the message of the church until we leave here the prim AR message of the church is receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah brother BR said when we see those things upon the Earth today oh people this is the last hour get that token over you quickly as you can you get in the token as we see the great inside the time at hand warning us time is at hand oh take this solemnly we should love one another oh my we should be so in love don't ever speak evil against one another and that includes the pastor or the trustees or the Deacons right leadership's not fair game speak evil against none of us are right if somebody makes a mistake pray for him right quick we are together in this with God we are brothers and sisters oh live Godly live live like Daughters of God live like sons of God live sweet kind and humble let no evil come in your mind and your thinking right now this is what he said this is the message for today right we could get all excited about things that are coming and that would be fine but this is the message for today right let no evil come in your mind and you're thinking let just dismiss it if it knocks on the door take it away just say just show your token just keep walking I am under the blood oh the death angel would have loved to have come in on those Israelites who were under the blood but he could not cross the threshold oh church and the death that's on this Earth the spiritual death today cannot cross cross the threshold of a home that's under the token you say I'm worried about my children I'm worried what they'll become you come under the token you bring your family under the token you do what God Said obey the messenger obey the messenger of the hour do what God says and you don't have to worry about them why it's a token he said well they might leave and go out but they'll be back why you applied the token are you with me now yes H just he said just show your token token and keep walking I'm under the blood we've been keeping the lamb up now he said for quite a while watching seeing what he's doing watching his nature and everything but now the token has got to be applied so he said we made you know in every message there's a you you present an idea you present something and then there's an application right you apply it to your own life well that's what brother Brandon was telling us this isn't the presentation time this isn't prophecy time this is fulfillment time this isn't let's find some new message that brother Brandon preached let's let's get some man to bring us something new no this is application time when the token has got to be applied the prophets already come with the message Smite the uh the the lamb kill the lamb and smite the doorpost with the blood apply the token now it's application time sir he said we've been keeping him up for a while seeing his nature and everything but now the token has got to be applied it's got to be applied it's the only thing except a man be born of the spirit and of water he'll no wise enter in he said and should love one another Believers should separate themselves from the world don't just take it lightly now you people that's listening to this on tape you women you men you listen a minute he said if you ever believe me you believe me now believe it now oh Church you say they believe but brother brand was challenging the people he said if you believe me you'll do what I say right now look he said now you people that's listening he said if you're believeing you believe it now it's time to quit fussing with one another say brother Ben why have you tried to reach out why have you tried to why have you tried to not have grudges against churches and against people and tried to reach out and go to meetings and things because a prophet of God said now is the time to quit fussing with one another believe the message of the Bible believe Jesus Christ and love and honor and respect one another men respect your wives why would he put that in the token because when the spirit of Christ is in you what did Paul say husbands love your wives as Christ loved the church when the spirit of Christ is in you you brings a respect for your wife oh God help us today he said you respect your hom let bring your home together because remember the lamb this lamb is for the home that requires Godly leadership I know people don't believe in leadership today but God called men for a reason called husbands for a reason called men to be pastors for a reason cuz somebody's got to bring the church together somebody's got to bring the home together are you with me now of leadership for a reason and he said not bring your home together because remember the slam is for the home not just one for the whole home had to be brought you say well I don't have a husband I don't have that opportunity but you come together with the word and then come together with Christ and let and let that be something in your life you say well I may have this but build it up in your life let it be a strong point where you listen to other people huh I'm just preaching this morning you you forgive me but I just feel welcome this morning is is isn't the Lord wonderful to us you got to listen to to leadership or do do you any good huh Rahab had to she had to tell the message to her family right now she was the one who led them she wasn't married but she led her whole family to Christ right I hope you're hear me today she led her whole family as a as a single woman we'd call her today she led them to Christ as a single uh woman but now look how did she do it under the influence of Josh of the of the two witnesses who come in who were under the influence of Joshua she come under leadership and when they said hang the cord outside the the window she hung the cord outside the window and what happened to her her whole family was saved are you with me now oh my we should love each other let me believe that today bring your home together the lamb was for the home not just one for the whole home had to be brought everything had to be brought and we should love each other and Believers should separate themselves from the world he said notice they were not just yet come together to talk about the message they come together to apply the blood to apply the token that's what you must do Pastor Neville now he's preaching to me I just put my name in there instead of brother Neville's but he's talking to the pastor of the church because brother Brandon believed in pastors that's what you must do Pastor Neville and to this congregation trustees deacons to you Brethren it's time we laid aside all the foolishness of the world time we laid everything else we've seen enough now till we are positive sure and the token must be applied without it you're going to perish you must perish that's the only thing oh don't come together and say I believe it get beneath it get into it what it's a token it's the literal life of Jesus Christ coming back on the believer now there were Jews remember when when Christ died there were Jews at the temple offering bloody Lambs doing everything that the law required keeping the letter of Moses law but their faith was not recognized what was it the Lamb of God was on Calvary oh Church the Lamb of God was on Calvary and they tried because what what happened it changed from circumcision to the literal blood now it would change from the literal blood to the life right and they offered Lambs and at that moment that he died the lamb was no longer effective and all that you get when you slay a lamb today a physical lamb is a stinking carcass that's it that's all you get when you try to work your way in that's all you get when you try to say well I pay my ties and I go to church just a stinking carcass there's no life in it but if you can believe un the salvation of your soul if you can believe to the baptism of the Holy Ghost something that seals you into the kingdom of God see he made one sacrifice forever look at Hebrews chapter 10: 11 he said every priest standeth daily ministering and offering often times the same sacrifices which can never take away sins but this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever set down on the right hand of God from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his foot stol for by offering Heath perfected forever someone say forever he had perfected forever them that are Sanctified was it on the day of Pentecost the Spirit come back on the disciples as a token he'd recognized their faith listen what he told them in Luke 24:49 behold I send the promise of my father upon you but te you in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high what was it before they could begin their Ministry they needed to be sealed before you can begin working for God you need to be sealed oh my we must have the Holy Ghost or we cannot manifest the word for our day Paul Paul found some Baptist Believers in Ephesus I'm going to skip through some of this brother Robert because I'm running out of time but you all know the story how that they were baptized under John's baptism and then said Paul in verse four John verely baptized with the baptism of repentance saying unto the people they should believe on him which should come after him on Christ Jesus he said when they heard this they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus and when Paul had laid his hands upon them the Holy Ghost came on them they spake with tongues and prophesied what was it what brought the baptism of the Holy Ghost their faith in the word and their obedience to it brother BR said full obedience entitles us to the Token look he said how did Abraham prove his faith by by circumcision now look that's how Abraham proved his faith how did Moses prove his faith how did they do that in Moses time the blood was on the door right how do we prove our faith today are you with me now how do we prove our faith is effective the baptism of the Holy Ghost right we we don't just wait forever listen if it's a struggle for you and I know some people that struggle for years about whether or not they have it and I'll say this I'll say this have you fully surrendered because if you've not fully surrendered you don't don't you won't get it right but if you fully surrendered and repented and your faith is in the blood not in a man but in the blood to cleanse you from sin you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost I think sometimes people are looking for some great emotional experience and I believe there is a definite experience but it might be as simple as you lifting your hands during the service and saying lord it's me it's for me this service was for me and he baptized you with the Holy Ghost right there that's right you might have done that and then the devil fought you ever since you why the devil start fighting me so much oh you believe to the Holy Ghost to the baptism of the Holy Ghost and and the devil's trying to take that away from you but I'll tell you what you will see you'll see a change in your life you'll see there's a desire you didn't have before to go to the house of God to be around God's people to love him with all of your heart there'll be something there we didn't exist before am oh my look brother said the Holy Ghost is our witness he is the proof he's the seal he is the Bonafide rights he is the abstract deed to every word God spoke so the word is like a deed that you get a warranty deed is what we call it you get a warranty deed I could sign a deed to you and not even own the property right I could I could lie to you and and give you a deed but it could be fake but what do you do you don't just take a deed do you huh you shouldn't I spent 15 years in Land Title work don't just take a deed if a property is not worth giving you an abstract to or a title insurance then it's not worth buying right because because you don't know anybody might have rights to that property just because somebody says you see the parallel just because somebody says they're a Believer doesn't mean that God has recognized so he said the Holy Ghost is the abstract deed to every word God spoke not just a deed but an abstract Hallelujah see we are not our own witness he is our witness so possessing a deed to property doesn't prove ownership of it it's an Evidence but not proof yes you might have things in your life you say well this happened and this happened and I it's an Evidence but the proof is the abstract a deed is a claim to rights but a deed can be forged but the deed must be sent to the Abstract Company the title must be searched back to the beginning to really have the proof the abstract with your name on the front look when you get the abstract back or today we do title insurance but back in the day when you had an abstract you you get it back and it's got your name on the front because there's a line there that has all the people in title right and if it says you and others you got a problem right if it says you subject to the terms and conditions you got a problem but if you could ever get an abstract that just says Ben pruit owner Ben pruit grantee Ben prit current owner whatever language they use Ben prit and I know that's a guarantee the company will stand behind it that they search old church they've searched it all the way back it's a guarantee I own the property I can enforce the rights to the property the law will stand behind my my deed they won't just stand behind a warranty deed but they got to stand behind the abstract to the deed oh Church they oh if you got a deed but the abstract comes out in somebody else's name that's what the law stands behind it's somebody else's name but what happened God gave you a deed and he gave you an abstract Amen brother BR said God gave Abraham a promise Abraham believed God it was imputed unto him for righteousness but he sealed the Covenant by the Seal of circumcision God gives you a promise potentially that you will receive it and you're going to be raised up see that's the deed the deed says right if the Same Spirit dwells in you it also Quicken your mortal body the deed said we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye that's what the deed says right it's a promise of a resurrection it's a promise you can live in L on and sea and not be overcome by it it's a promise of healing it's a promise of salvation of your children it's a promise yes the deed is a promise sir but just a promise alone it's not what Abraham needed he needed the Seal of the promise and God give you a promise he said potentially that you will receive it you're going to be raised up this body is going to be glorified with him at the end time but you see you've got to get a clearance on that deed that was literally my job it's what I did I went to the courthouse starting up here in altta Missouri and I worked over in uh in paragold and up in poper Bluff as well and my job as I as I went through different jobs I've done every job in an abstract company my job initially was simply to look and see who had a lean who had rights and so I had to be very careful in search because the company would stand behind that search we had skin in the game we would stand behind it and so I had to very carefully back then we went through index cards I'm flipping through the cards I'm seeing well here's a judgment here's a debt that's not paid here's a lean here's a mortgage right so I was physically going through the papers now it's done on computer I was going through the papers this is this way and this is that way and as I was going through it and then I prepared document that it was called a commitment and see that's as far as many people have ever come right they've come to the statement the stage where they've got the document showing what's wrong but it's never been cleared but there was a closing agent and I did that job for a while too and the closing agent's job was to strike off all of that to make sure it all got settled it wasn't enough in order to sell the house you don't just expose the sin but you got to clear it off glory to God cuz you want to give a clear deed oh my listen you don't want to go through Leo the sea without a clear deed you don't want to make it through life you young people getting married don't get married until you have a clear deed to your salvation you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost you got a clearance on the deed and that clearance is when everything someone say everything against it has been stricken off and you got the abstract to it you got the seal it's yours you don't have to call the old sin and and argue with it the closing agent did that Hallelujah I spent many hours on the phone with old bankruptcies and old cases and attorneys why did I do that so they wouldn't have to why do you have the Holy Ghost you don't have to argue with what happened and and say well I I can't ever be the any different I can't ever be the same but God said I'm going to strike it all off let the Holy Ghost come in and clear the deed until you know there's therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit Hallelujah you got to get a clearance on that deed the clearance is when everything against it been stricken off you got the abstract to you got the seal it's yours everything on it belongs to you and when we believe listen how simple this is when we believe on Jesus Christ for our savior and repent and are baptized and come up to believe him God recognizes our repentance and our faith towards him and sends down the abstract and the abstract is the Assurance it's the guarantee that everything was ever held against you you thoroughly repented Hallelujah and the property is bought and you hold the abstract for the Assurance he said let somebody try to put you off the land say he belongs you with the abstract in your hand I see you could have the deed in your hand he'll laugh at you right the letter alone but if you got the abstract you got the deed and you got the clearance oh Church you apply the token with that word what happens he said let him try to do there ain't no law in the L do it because you hold the abstract there's no devil no church or any theology that can overstep the boundaries of God's proof and Abstract that the baptism of the Holy Ghost has recognized Us in Jesus Christ we're just as sure to raise as he raised CU potentially we've already raised in him what does it do to our mortal bodies it turns our opinion come on Church it turns our opinion changes our Notions it sets our affections on things which are above and the smoking drinking gambling the things you used to do is dead it's beneath you you're quickened this quickening power brings your body into a raptured condition already he said notice the Pentecostal people if there they got quickened by the Holy Spirit listen to me when those Pentecostal group up there on the day of Pentecost received their abstract Deed from God sure J glorified their souls they screamed they saw tongues of fire separated upon each of them it's so quick in their body they couldn't even speak in Earthly language anymore it quickened their body to a Heavenly language the place they're going to oh church that's why so many times when they receive the baptis of the Holy Ghost they spoke in tongues why it's not an Evidence what is it it you're just changing their language to a Heavenly language it's not the evidence of the Holy Ghost but it's God's doing something are you with now the place they going to quickening power of God shook their mortal body so to their entire mortal language was transfigured transformed into an immortal language what a quickening power what something that belongs if the spirit that raises up Jesus from the dead dwells in your mortal bodies it shall also Quicken your mortal bodies we are quickened them by the power of the Living God tongues Quicken to a new Heavenly language to speak to them are rapturing up raising up into a different atmosphere than what they had ever lived in Hallelujah I got to move on brother BR said the abstract was designed to give them every promise that was on the grounds words everything that was in the deed the abstract was designed to enforce that title to them therefore they laid hands on the sick they was healed they spoke in new tongues they done great signs and wonders because that was in God's promise when Jesus died redeem that back to in the grounds that belonged to sons of God he demonstrated what God was listen what he says I'm closing in just a moment he said how dare we to socialize that and put it into an organization how dare we care what our last name is how dare we to socialize that go a step further just because you you belong to a big church or a small church I don't know if we're big or small I don't know what we are mediumsized I guess I don't I don't how dare are we to socialize it it's the power of God we don't socialize it we treat people right but it's not a social Affair we don't put it in an organization and say you're the bride if you listen to this you're the bride if you believe this Doctrine you're the bride if you follow this man it's nonsense how dare we to socialize that put it into an organization we have no no rights to do that I don't control the baptism of the Holy Ghost listen we baptize people here sometimes I go to other churches I'm completely fine with that right why because if they receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost God gets to lead them where they go are you with me now how dare we to socialize that it's just our church that'll make it it's nonsense have no rights to do that it's the Holy Spirit today hunting out honest hearts that will believe that message everything in the Bible that was promised is to that belever and when you accept it in his fullness and God knows that you'll do it he gives you the abstract to that and then every promise that's made is in your possession and the Holy Spirit is there to Quicken that to you oh my what kind of people should we be oh my you say well that means it's all over then no that just means you entered into the land now it's time to fight you remember I think it was brother Shawn made the statement he said when they entered the land he said the promises became real and so did the Giant the promises were just a story but the Giants were just a story too depends on which story you're going to believe right whose report are you going to believe well they believe God's report when they got there the promises was real the Giants were real Caleb never said there's no Giants in the land what did he say we're more than able to take the land God never did say when you receive the baptism of the holy ghost things will go easy some of you young Christian you need to hold on to the horns of the altar hold on to God God never said it'd go easy he never said your bank account would look good and and all your relationships would just be magically healed and everything would take no but he said there's the power to do that you got the rights to it you just got to go claim it and possess it musicians go ahead and come you say brother Ben I I struggle with knowing whether I have the token or not brother Brandon preached desperations after he preached the token Sunday morning the three-hour sermon and then he comes back that night and preaches desperations has a prayer line and when he preached desperations and if I was going to listen to the Token I'd listen to desperations right after it's important because brother brand picks up on that he said I can feel a spirit he said people say how do I know how do I know brandom how do I know he said look what were you and what are you yes there is how you know it wouldn't be faith if we got some kind of we got some kind of letter from the pastor told us now you have the Holy Ghost plus he could be [Music] wrong there's no faith in that but look what were you not how many tapes did you listen to how many services did you go to did you always get just exactly 10% of your ties you know what were you what are you there is how you know what was you before this token was applied what are you after it's applyed Raab sat in that house and she said I'm going to apply the token before her family was divided but now they come together under a promise amen and when death came all around them listen to me Church death is in the land death is all through leoda you said well I don't know whether I want to serve God or not there's death in the land there's death in the pot it's full of death it was death all around her houses started crumbling to her right houses started crumbling to her left and her house was right on the wall it should have fell but it didn't fall hallelujah what were you Rahab and what are you and brother B said she she married that that that Prince among the people that General and what did she become he said she got a house in Bethlehem she'd come from a place of harlotry to a beautiful home in Bethlehem what were you and what are you today this is how you know what was you before this token was applied what are you after it's applied what was your desires before and what is your desire is after then you know whether the token is applied or not and these other things he's talking about tongues and signs and all of that will just automatically go with that right not everybody speaks in tongues not everybody shouts but we all change we all change we all sitting there like Rahab once we believe the message and we watch DEATH coming all around us can you imagine being there under the token when Moses spoke that and the death angel in every home there was there was a a mayy dying but in the homes of the Believers there was life oh my I believe it's that way today would you bow your heads with me I know people I know people are down on this message and say well it doesn't produce nothing I challenge that I challenge The [Music] Narrative compare where we're at with where the world is just comp compare it for a moment compare where we're at to where the worldly church is I'm not trying to make you feel special or above people that's it ought to Humble us today compare where you're at the opportunity that you have in your life to live for God and love God with all your heart compare that compare it with what you were compare where you're at today you'll have to come to this conclusion this message Works what the messenger said was true what he said wasn't to follow him he said not for one moment do I bring a message so people would follow me but that they could have a deeper relationship with Jesus Christ they could come under the token and be saved every head bowed and every eye closed if you've never never received the baptism of the Holy Ghost why don't you believe to it this morning believe to it just believing is not enough but you believe to it it's it's a real experience with God believe to it you hold on to that maybe you're not sure well where were you take an honest appr praisal where where were you and what are you then you can know and let the Holy Ghost bring Assurance in your heart maybe you're a Christian today that you feel kind of backslid but you know you received the baptism of the Holy Ghost you know that but you just kind of backit on God why don't you just talk to God for a minute yourself and say Lord I I know that I I'm not where I should be Lord would you refill me with the Holy Ghost today not that he ever left you but it just lost its effect on you you just don't have feel the same in the service anymore it's got less effect see the token was a visible Sign In the Flesh it's got to be something that has a real effect in our lives you say brother brother Ben I want you to pray for me if you slip up your hand and just just acknowledge that to the Lord I I want the same thing church I I want a refilling of the holy ghost in my life I believe the Lord will answer every one of those prayers it's just that simple Church you surrender when you fully surrender that's why sometimes we have to come to an altar because sometimes that's what it takes to fully surrender but you can fully surrender right where you're at this morning if you'll just really give yourself over to God say God I completely surrender myself to you I'm surrendering my family to you we're not going to live how we want to live anymore we're going to live by the message message of the hour we're going to come under the token under the blood Lord Jesus I thank you today I thank you for being here with us I thank you that this message is more Lord than just just words but it's a it there's there's a life in it Lord it wasn't a man but it was it was the unfailing body word of the son of man oh that we're feeding on today Lord and this is the message of the hour this is what God wants it's the token Lord I pray that you'd bring us close to you Lord today I pray you give the token Lord to those that don't have it Lord give them the full Assurance of their Faith Lord to those who are backs Lord and maybe not doing it they know it they know it they know they ought to be doing something different but they're not they're trying by intellectual means to solve and heal but Lord they can't do that it takes you oh God I pray you help them to realize it today Lord it takes a a supernatural work it may not be a great show it'll be a supernatural work I pray you grant it today we thank you for your love thank you for your goodness I pray you'd move in every heart Lord May the token come on display in every home Lord for our children for our young people Lord Oh how we as adults need to be serious Lord we need to be sincere so our youth Lord growing up in
