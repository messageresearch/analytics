I want to turn to Proverbs chapter 18 tonight Proverbs 18:10 and then we'll also read from Isaiah 32 Isaiah 321 Proverbs 18:10 and Isaiah 321 we'll just have one service on Sunday and we won't be having dinner at the fellowship hall the Joel may have already said that but I want to remind you of that one service on Sunday and it's Christmas time so we're going to make the best of it that we can with our families and enjoy them and also enjoy one another this time of year such a wonderful time of Fellowship Proverbs 18:10 let's just read this the name of the Lord is a strong tower the righteous run into it and is safe you glad to have a strong tower to run into and then Isaiah 321 Isaiah 321 Behold a king shall reign in righteousness and princes shall rule in judgment and a man shall be as a hiding place from the wind and a covert from The Tempest as rivers of water in a dry place as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land aren't you glad you found that Rock Amen God bless you you can be seated I want to speak to you tonight on letting off the pressure at Christmas time Christmas always get me thinking about uh stories makes me a little bit sentimental get to thinking about times past and home time back home and maybe not the obvious stories because we didn't have a very much Christmas as a child and wasn't because we were poor it was because we made life difficult for ourselves with the way we interpreted things with the message at at Christmas time and so we uh we always got something from our parents but it wasn't I don't have a lot of Christmas Memories in that way and so Christmas is special to me now but I do have have a memory that reminds me of Christmas and it's actually a memory of going out in the yard one time and and uh having to catch a rooster for Mom because Dad wanted fried chicken and we had to catch this rooster and I'll never forget that I don't think we ever had to do it again in fact the meat was really tough I I just say if you have a rooster and keeping it for that it may not be the best thing let him run all over the yard and get old so the meat was really tough but what I remember about that is chasing that thing down and uh and and what we do is we' ring its neck and uh not to be too graphic tonight but we'd ring the thing's neck and and pull it off and so when the neck come off uh what surprised me at the time is that the rooster didn't stop running this is a Christmas story so just let me get through it tonight and the rooster just kept running around and around the yard and I'll never forget that as long as I live the blood just spurting up out of where the where the head was and and he just going in circles he got no purpose it's always reminded me of Christmas time because some folks just lose their heads at Christmas and I think that we need to look at the message of the hour and and I thank God for the light that he's shown on our day that helps us keep our balance at Christmas time and where we don't lose our heads and the birth of Christ I think the Bible says peace on Earth and Good Will toward men but it's a season and that we celebrate his birth in this season though we know he wasn't born on December 25th and yet his birth That season that we celebrate that often brings disappointment and loneliness and pressure and we find that uh they find that about 64% of people with mental illness say that the holidays make their conditions worse and they found that three out of five Americans feel that their mental health is negatively impacted by the holidays and and that's kind of the time that we're living in and it's a time when they're running around like a chicken that's lost its head and and they're constantly buying and doing and and it seems like American response now to everything is buy more right right it doesn't matter what it is war buy more is it famine buy more is it is it scarcity is it economic distress just buy more get a credit card and and spend on it and it just seems to be a a consumer age it's a neurotic age brother brandham preaches a message called letting off the pressure talking about his age and how neurotic it was oh if he could have only lived to see 2023 but he talked about it being neurotic and he said we're living in a neurotic age he said nervous tension everybody is racing here and going there and going nowhere sounds like Christmas doesn't it it sounds like Walmart really he said it's just to that kind of an age he said I know this church would be plagued with it it's everywhere it's plagued with it the Tabernacle is plagued with it everywhere the whole world said it's a day of pressure hurry hurry hurry hurry up and wait I've been thinking a lot about this lately in regards even to Ministry it's not how much we do or or how many times we preach or anything like that but it's being able to uh to get across what God puts on her heart it's it's the ability to impact someone's life in a positive way how can we do that more is not always more more is not always better but we live in this day of pressure hurry hurry hurry up and wait Drive 90 miles an hour and and get home for supper and wait two hours till it gets ready say that's right it's a time in that rushing and speeding it gets you to a nervous tension he said the wife say something a little contrary you want to fly off temper husband say something I know this isn't talking about yall but we'll just talk about my house for a minute husband say something you'll patch your foot and tell him to get in the room say well now husband I don't I don't want no words with you get out there wife oh I'm so nervous see why what's the matter all this together this tension building up he said then the results of it is doing something wrong and acting out of place and many times if we would change our environment we would get different results if we would change our atmosphere we would get different results I know young people many times in they fail in certain ways different ways that a young person might fail in and they and they just keep failing in that way and and keep messing up and think well what could I do well it's not really so much the thing as it is the atmosphere that's causing it and you find yourself in an atmosphere of defeat and an ATM osphere where it feels like that you just can't make it and everything is is going wrong and and everything begins to go get out of culture and you need to hear the voice of God but what your body and and what your mind tells you you need is something else what you really need is to hear the voice of God you need I don't want to get into Sunday's sermon but you need to hear the voice of God speaking in that chaos to bring order out of chaos and that's what the world heard at Christmas time was the voice of Jehovah they heard the voice of Jehovah was heard it was more than just a baby in a Manger but the voice of God spoken a time of chaos and that's what we need but many times we we we turn to other things and and so but if we could just change the atmosphere sometimes you don't even need to study and read your Bible though that's good but sometimes you just need to get out and take a walk or go do something and spend some time with friends be around church people and be around people that that are not negative negative and dragging you down all the time and I know sometimes family gets that way at Christmas time sometimes you just got to get away and and get in a different atmosphere amen so and so what we want to do is is we don't want to be like what he's describing here he said you begin to act this tension builds up and then the results of it is doing something wrong and acting out of place he said it'll make the poor act that way it'll make the middle class act that way it'll make the rich act that way it'll make the wrong act that way it'll make the pretty good act that way it'll make the good act that way and you get a whole bunch of saints and sinners all acting the same right church people and non-church people yeah message people and and Baptist right all acting the same you say why do they act like that brother Ben why are they so why are they not different because they're human beings and in this time of pressure tension builds up and there there's got to be an outlet there's got to be some way that we let off the pressure and I'm so glad we have a place of Refuge today I'm so glad we have a place we can go to and let off the pressure at Christmas time he said it'll make the good act that way because it's tension steam built up listen the very best Saint here tonight if you I put you in the right conditions you're going to snap back at me right the very best Saint if given the right conditions you you know in your own home some of you some of you couples you never fight but given the right conditions you could say something you didn't mean given the right conditions the boiler might blow up he said because it's tension steam built up got to blow it out somewhere he said no we find it builds up as the day goes you talk to your boss if you're working oh so and so if you speak to the kitty come in here mama I'm if there you are it builds it up and I'll say this for men who who are not working sometimes you're off at Christmas time or maybe you're in between jobs or something like that if you don't have a set task to do and you get up in the morning that's the worst time to be a man because actually that builds up pressure you retire and you're under pressure right because you feel like you should be doing something you should be being productive maybe you get sick and you're unable to work like you used to and and it's just pressure constantly and I think sometimes wives don't really understand that and I'm not I'm not just preaching at you wives but you need to understand that a man was made to go out and make a living and work and and do those things and it's hard to sit at home and have nothing to do you want to do something and if not you build off you bu build up pressure and pretty soon you you you meant to stay home together and and and and and spend quality time together I don't know why I'm saying this tonight but you you meant to stay home spend quality time together and what you end up doing is fighting together right and then you're ready for him to leave and he's ready for you to leave but there's a way to deal with the pressure yes well brandom said there you are he said he said it builds it up he said oh my see you feel like you're going to your head is going to come off he said I know I'm with it every day he said I don't know how his wife felt about that but he said so I know what it means he said it builds up it builds up and how many can say Amen to that we still live in this time of pressure how do we deal with pressure I think the most pressure that a man could be under would be in a fear for his life and the Bible describes someone and brother brandom uses it in this sermon and you can find in numbers 35 I won't go and read it because to save time tonight but you'll find that the Bible describes a man uh who had inadvertently killed someone maybe he had through uh uh some fault that something that he had done that he didn't realize was going to happen maybe maybe in a moment of uh just uh he didn't mean to hit them that hard and something happened and it basically what we would call today manslaughter and and if a person did that he knew this person's family was going to come get him and under the law they had a right to wouldn't that be something if our legal system worked that way where the families of all the people that were bereaved could actually come after the person that did the crime well there may be less crime but and and so they would have an Avenger of blood there would be somebody designated in the family to come after this person and so now as they the amount of pressure that this man must have been under here he's killed someone he didn't mean to he's made a horrible mistake he made an awful mistake and there's nothing he can do to change it because once you take a life that's it it's over and so he's going through this tremendous pressure and yet the law provided a way for him to go to a place where there would be a a letting off of the pressure there would be a City of Refuge that he could reach that he could go to they they put six cities all through the land of Israel and those those cities would be a place of refuge and so immediately if it happened he would know where that place was and he would immediately run as hard as he could go for a City of Refuge because he knew if he didn't he was going to get killed so now he had to go into that place now brother brandom tells us about that he said then the nervous neurotic age that you're living in he said you know in all of this the doctors don't have the answer because they're plagued with it too' they don't have the answer they don't know what to do you realize that that the psychologist has the same problem you do and the doctor has the same problem that you do right he deals with the same things that you deal with I'll go a little bit further the pastor the preacher deals with the same thing you deal with we don't like to admit it all the time but we we we're all under the same pressure he said they don't know what to do oh doctor I'm just about to blow blow my head I don't know what to do well he'd say I am too well there's nothing you can do he'd give you a tranquilizer when that wears off you're more nervous than you was in the first place he said like a drunk man taking an extra drink to get over his drunkenness he said see you can't do it there's no answer they don't have it but God has the answer he said and that's what we want to talk about he is the answer Christ is the answer to every problem you've got and I want to say at Christmas time when the pressure builds up and it seems like you're just running around like that rooster with your head cut off and running around doing nothing when it seems like you getting nothing done go into Christ come into the city of refuge and let him be the one who lets off the pressure for you let him be your safe place well brother BR said I want to say something to the people here he said if you're not a Christian I come to the City of Refuge about 31 years ago and brother he said I've never wanted to go out oh I come into Christ everything that I longed for was in here he said I don't want to go out I pray daily oh God I'm so happy here just let me say see the one that went into the City of Refuge had to be willing to to remain there cuz if he ever stepped foot back outside he was fair game again he said I never want to leave and I know he will never leave me I know he'll never leave you and the pressure gets great if it does he is our Outlet so we don't have to worry about it he said if you're all pressured up and don't know where you're going what's going to happen to you after death and you know you're going to die sometime you've got it to do then the thing to come is come to Christ The Refuge and let off the pressure settle it once for am and I I just want to encourage you tonight as we're going to go and make a little turn here and go a little bit different direction but I want to encourage you if you've not come into Christ do that M make sure that you found the City of Refuge make sure you have a place to run to because you may try to live like a Christian and act like a Christian try to be the very best Christian You Can Be You may make everybody think that you are one but if you're not in Christ the pressure will get to you one of these days right you might as well just surrender to him and say Lord let let me be in you let me let me be a part of the word let me be a part of your bride you have to be completely surrendered to him I heard brother brandham talking and God's gifts always find their places he said he said the only gift that he wants is a surrendered life the gift that he wants is all of us he said if you're just in the church and and you just say well I'm going to make it a social Gathering or something like that I'm just going to go to church that's not what he wants at Christmas time he wants you he wants all of you if you're just going to be a social Christian the pressure is going to get to you before long yes a lot of pressure in this age and it's going to get to you but I'm so glad we have a City of Refuge yes he said no matter what takes place Christ is our refuge and when we come to him we can let off the pressure you can quit worrying about well if I die what's going to happen to me what's going to happen to the wife what's going to happen to the husband what's going to happen to the children just come to Christ and let off the pressure he said all he gives us all things all things are ours by Christ so just let the pressure off the only one way you can do it now brother brand say something strange here he say somebody might give you a million dollars it' build up pressure and you think about that and you think well if I just had more money at Christmas time I'd be better off well you might just have more pressure he said you might join a church and still build up pressure cu the Methodist will tell you they're right and the Baptist is wrong and the Baptist say they're wrong and we're right it just builds up more pressure CU you don't know where you're standing but if you ever come to Christ you can let off the pressure cuz it's all over then he said just settle it down it's God's provided place of safety where God said the name of the Lord is a mighty tower the righteous run into it and are safe in a time of sickness when sickness strikes and the doctor says there's nothing else I can do about it he said don't build up pressure those that are sick tonight maybe you're watching or you're here and you've not been feeling well let off the pressure believe he's your healer tonight he's our refuge he said while you're in this Refuge you've got a right to anything that's in the Refuge and Christ is our refuge and everything you have need of is in him now and I appreciate your prayers tonight I want to take a little bit of a turn before we close and I want to look at some of the things that the message teaches us that would help us take off the pressure at this time of year now where is the City of Refuge what is it it's Christ right what is Christ he is the word and and the message of the hour is the light that shines on the word for our day so it reveals Christ to us so we have in the message a picture of what God would want at Christmas time of what the Bible says and and what what should actually happen at Christmas time and so we don't want to look to anything else we want to look to the message of the hour and don't don't get nervous I know it kind of tightened up there a little bit I'm not going to rebuke you I'm not going to get on to you I just want us to look at some things that brother brandham taught us about Christmas and positive and maybe some negative but just some things that he taught us because we we need to understand this time of year especially we need to find that City of Refuge and first of all you're not going to find that in the tensil of Christmas christ is not found in the tinsel of Christmas more is not always better and you don't have to compare with everybody else to have fun at Christmas or to worship at Christmas or enjoy Christmas whatever that means to you you don't have to you don't have to be what everybody else says you have to be CU most of them are just trying to make money off of you but the ROM talks about Christmas tensely all the tinsel up and down the street of Santa Claus a German fiction Catholic dogma he said there's not one ounce of it true it takes the place of Jesus Christ in the hearts of too many Americans Christmas don't don't mean Santa Claus Christmas Means Christ now remember this is our refuge our safe place right and you don't find safety by by stepping as far as you can out in and we're going to go just as far as we can outside the wall and just keep an eye on the city no that that you can't feel safe like that how do we find our safety by staying within the boundaries of the word right that's our City of Refuge so he says Christmas don't mean Santa Claus Christmas Means Christ not some man with a pipe coming down the chimney he said and he said teaching your children and such as that what do you expect them to grow up to be he said tell them the truth not some fictitious story tell them there's a God Of Heaven who sent his son and That's What Christmas Means that's what brother Brandon taught Christmas Means so I uh what we did and and what many message people did you you remember what we did is we SE we separated Christmas from God and we said well Christmas is Pagan so now we're going to separate that from God and then Christmas is just something we have to do for the kids but but we won't mention it at church we won't have it at church but that's not what a prophet did right brother brandom always preached a Christmas sermon in fact it'd take some pressure off of you if you go listen to some of those at Christmas time sermons like God's wrapped gift and God's gifts always find their places and the great Shining Light and and and why it had to be Shepherds and why little Bethlehem and and so many of those sermons that means so much to us but but brother brandham tells us he doesn't tell us to ignore Christmas right or we'll see in a minute not to make it Pagan but to actually say what Christmas is really about right he said tell them the truth not on some fictitious story tell them there's a God of heaven and That's What Christmas Means he's near coming again he said as the pressure begins to come to the earth now listen the pressure begins to come to the Earth he said the devil has put out his things by eyes what you can see the tinsil and so forth God has put out his which is spirit that you can't see but you believe so you need to look at the Unseen now remember they ask at that time and this is another sermon that brother P preached where is he King of the Jews and they' asked him they' asked the the people in Jerusalem where is he and they didn't know but they were led by that great Shining Light and brother brand said Jerusalem had not the answer of where Christ was Jeffersonville doesn't have the an Louisville doesn't America doesn't the world doesn't God has the answers and he's promised that he would manifest them he said and I declare to you that that same Jesus who was born 1900 years lives today from the resurrection is the same yesterday today and forever so what can we do to let off the pressure at Christmas time we can realize that Christ is not found in the tenil of Christmas I believe that the message teaches us that Christmas should not be a pagan celebration in fact brother BR we don't celebrate Christmas we we worship at Christmas time in the early church the controversy wasn't Christmas trees as it is today and I'm not going to go fully into that but you all understand that I think and but it was eating food that been dedicated to an idol you I don't that doesn't mean anything to us but to them it was a real it was a real problem whether or not you should eat food that been dedicated to an idol and here's what Paul says about that and I think it applies to a lot of things around Christmas Paul says this he said as concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in SA sacrifice to Idols we know that Idol is nothing now there's a revelation and that there's no other God but one he says for though there there be that are called Gods whether in heaven or in earth as there be Gods many and Lords many but to us there is but one God the father of whom are all things and we in him and one Lord Jesus Christ by whom are all things and we by him he said how be it there is not in every man that knowledge for some with conscience of the idol into this hour eat it as a thing offered to an idol and their conscience being weak is defiled I'll say this whatever you do at Christmas time do it in faith am don't do something that condemns you right at Christmas time and we said this even about Co when it come to taking the vaccine or not and everybody was one side or the other whatever you do you have to do in faith if you go to the doctor and you don't go in faith believing he can help you won't won't do you any good right if you come to church and don't do it in faith believing that something at the church will help you it don't do you any good just showing up is admirable but there's so much more than that that we could gain if we just believe God's got something for us if we could look past the man standing behind the ppit if we can look past all the idiosyncrasies of of the pastor or the preacher or whatever and we can see that Christ wants to speak to us he wants to talk to us so whatever we do we must it must be done in faith if it offends your conscience don't do it and and and try not to offend other people's consciences within limits here's where Paul sets to limit he says Romans 14:1 him that is weak in the faith receive ye in other words don't kick him out of the church because he got a different idea about these things than you do but not to doubtful disputations other words don't argue with him on Facebook that's the new revise fing so receive the the one who's weak who doesn't have the faith to maybe do what you can do right and that applies to different areas in our life don't don't don't throw it in his face don't don't be rude but not to doubtful disputations don't argue about it don't don't let people put pressure on you because you do this for Christmas or don't do this or don't don't stop giving those Idols power to talk right and and everybody wants to talk about Jeremiah 10 and what that has to do with Christmas it has nothing to do with Christmas and you know how I know cu the Vindicated Prophet didn't say anything about it and but but people talk about Christmas that being Christmas tree or whatever what it was was an idol but quit giving that Idol power to talk if you've invested in the power of an idol you do need to stay away from it but that don't mean that don't matter what it is it may be a car it may be a job it may be your spouse may be your preacher it may be the church but don't don't don't make it an idol if you got a problem with worshiping it bring it to my house I don't have a problem with that so I won't have to buy one what do the prophet say about about these things about not making Christmas Pagan I don't want to get too specific tonight but just to kind of give us an idea kind of let the pressure off a little bit the brand said from them first little Christmases when we hang up our stockings and Mama would get said we'd probably get an orange and two three little piece a striped candy and that was a great Christmas to us he said but you know kids they look forward for them gifts he said we find out that Christmas is mainly children he said they look forward to that now nowadays it's turned off to the children but now listen he said but it really should be adults he said they should be teaching their children what real Christmas is so you can if you're somebody gets on to you being Liking Christmas too much you say well brother Brandon said Christmas is for adults right but he said he should be teaching their children what real Christmas is and again it couldn't have been on December 25th we know that was the time that the Romans had their festival and things like this and brother brandom goes through all of that and in uh and God's gets find their places he goes through all that in many places and when when he does but he comes to this conclusion he says but what difference does it make right he said see today he said even if they was doing it in July or August or whatever it might be he said it's still the sacredness of remembering that God gave us the hope that we have in us and now you say well the rest of them is all Santa Claus and going on like they do why we just might as well do it he said no sir no this is not a pagan celebration to us this is a sacred hour if there had been no Christmas there would be no Resurrection if there had been no Christmas there'd be no love there'd be no peace there'd be no Hereafter for the believer if there had been no Christmas he said now you say well it's the rest of the world they just well he said 'w see the forked lightning and the black Cloudy Skies show that there can be light in the time of Darkness now I know people who who will give their children gifts on Thanksgiving because they don't want to attribute it to being a Christmas gift and I I don't I'm not going to knock them for doing that they're doing what they feel that is right and and want to offend their own conscience but I'll say this that brother brandham taught us that we celebrate Christmas at Christmas time because that's when it's the darkest that's when it's the most Pagan and that's the time that we should say this is not this is not what it's about but there's a light that come in our day that told us he wasn't born on December 25th but he was born and he was wrapped in flesh deity came down and was wrapped in a baby and wrapped in flesh and Jehovah cried out and spoke to the World on Christmas Christ was born at Christmas just not on December the 25th now look he said see the forked lightning and the black Cloudy Skies show that there can be light in the time of Darkness these lights tonight prove that there can be light in the time of darkness when does light shine its best in darkness he said you turn these lights in daytime the sun is shining he said you'll hardly notice they're on but just one little we light will shine real bright in a time of Darkness so I say well let's let's go ahead and and talk about Christ at Christmas time and let the world know there's still somebody who believes in the real meaning of Christmas he said right now is the darkness when every Christian should give a testimony of the hope that's in him of Jesus Christ the son of God not some Chris cringle that was born back Yonder and some kind of a tree lit up and went down through the forest one night some fiction story there's no bottom to it but we believe solidly on the promised word of God of a coming Messiah he was born on Christmas day right not not December 25th but he was born on Christmas day he said pretty near 2,000 years ago we believe amen does that give you comfort today does that give you let off the pressure a little bit at Christmas time I'll say this I think this would help us to let off the pressure I got just a few more minutes I I think if we'd stop spending money on things that we don't need money we don't have I say this if you have money spend it got real quiet I don't care what you do with your money you can save it if you want to you can spend it if you want to that's not what my job not to tell you what to do with your money but I'll say this stop spending money you don't have am because all that's going to do is build up pressure at Christmas does a message talk about that yes brother brandham gave gifts and accepted gifts at Christmas but he didn't try to give a gift to every person that gave him one and I I'm just going to place myself on record tonight that if you buy me a gift I may get you a gift and I may not because that's what I believe about Christmas that it should be the generosity of your heart not just because somebody else did it and then You' got to do it and and and make it like that brother brandom taught us not to do that he spoke against swapping gifts and so what that means is like well I got to buy them something they bought me something and so you're buying stuff you don't have the money you don't you're getting stuff you don't want giving stuff you don't want right kind of like the gift card Racket and I do give gift cards but it's it is kind of a racket and but he also spoke against he spoke against two things swapping gifts and giving inappropriate gifts and I don't mean that you can't have a game and swap gifts I mean that for the purpose of one uping one another and trying to trying to uh being under pressure because you don't have the right thing to give we should give appropriate gift did you know that brother brandham taught that an appropriate gift for a little girl was a baby doll that's what he said an appropriate gift ell likes that I'm sure an appropriate gift for a little girl is a baby doll at Christmas that's what he taught us when he told the story about the man that went out in the cold and his baby had died it's a it's a terrible story but he told talked about how he went out and he trying to find her a baby doll and he ended up freezing to death he gave us all BR said it's like Christ gave us all at Christmas gave us all come to the Earth and gave us all oh my but we want appropriate gifts appropriate gifts it may be a doll for a little a little girl but it may be just something appropriate something we can afford I I'll I'll say that and I'm not the example at Christmas I'm not because I I was chuckling today we went to Walmart before church because I had to pick up something on the way and there's a man in the aisle and he's walking down the aisle and he's muttering to himself and he he grabs a he grabs a uh a little coloring book off of the thing and throws it in his cart and say that's about enough Christmas for today he heads on down the aisle but Allen I could see myself right there man I usually buy Christmas presents on Christmas Eve I'd buy it Christmas Day if I could afford it brother Caleb's right there with me but or if the places were open to buy it but we want appropriate gifts and I'll say this most years that not every year but most years we've spent less than $50 a piece on our kids for Christmas don't be pressured into spending money you don't have but give something appropriate if you're going to give something I'll tell you what would be appropriate for us to give ourselves to Christ at Christmas time the BR said God spoke that word this son would be there where he was to make it shine he said there was that Heavenly visitor they was watching and speaking to the wise men and come right straight to it so they left the old Creed and started on the supernatural again away they went he said how they rejoiced the Bible said they rejoiced with exceeding great joy when they saw that light come again he said oh brother sister how nice it would be if each one of you if each one of us me if each one of us could lay aside all this here Christmas tinsel and and quit all this swapping gifts one with another all this nonsense of the world just take off our pride and lay it down Stomp the thing under foot and say Lord Jesus guide me to that Perfect Light could we do that tonight could we let off the pressure and say Lord guide me to that Perfect Light he said watch something Supernatural happen the holy spirit will come in a phenominal way he said on they went following the supernatural what did they leave they followed the Heavenly sign of that day he said Remember the god Heavenly god-given sign he said all of you believe that's true that was a Heavenly god-given sign they followed that sign till they found the word made flesh he was the word made flesh the Heavenly sign promised of that day LED them to the word made flesh brother sister he'll do the same Den this great sign from Heaven that we have the Holy Spirit living among us follow it amen again he said watch the gift these wise men brought to him he said today we find that we're swapping gifts everybody has to get a gift that's what he means by swapping gifts doesn't mean you can't give gifts or receive gifts but he said everybody has to get a gift and try to figure out what the next Fell's going to give him so he can give him something comparing that much he said if it isn't well in New Years he feels he has to make it up each one studying and worrying and walking the floor the millionaires how they're going to get by they give so much to this one and that when it's altogether wrong he said here there's only one gift that you can give and that's yourself give yourself to God because God's already give you his gift he said now there's only thing you owe back to God that's yourself to him and lastly I'll say this to let off the pressure at Christmas time let Christmas be a time of worship let it be a time of worship the Bible says when the wise men come into the house they saw the young child with Mary his mother and fell down and worshiped Him worship means to prostrate yourself before a king when they had opened their Treasures they presented to him gifts gold and frankincense and were appropriate gifts God so anointed Jesus with the fullness of himself he said he was God's gifts to the world wise men are clearly identified their offering their gift to him showed in their heart they knew who he was what he was going to do for them he says so wonder the first thing they did they fell down perfectly in order I believe it would be in order for us to have a worship service tonight on Sunday every day of the week every day of the year but especially at Christmas time I believe it would be appropriate for us to worship Christ the King he said before they could even understand it they fell down and worshiped him and then presented their gifts he said that's the way to have real Christmas worship him and then present your gift presenting your body as a Living Sacrifice holy and acceptable to God and he says this as musicians come he said now remember during Christmas Worship the Lord Jesus he didn't say ignore it he didn't say make it something Pagan but he said worship him in the power of his resurrection I may not the all the same Traditions that you have or all the same memories I don't know how many of you think of chickens running around with their heads cut off at Christmas time may not have all the same Traditions or the same memories maybe some things I do you wouldn't do and some things that you do that I wouldn't do but remember this at Christmas remember to worship him remember that he's worthy he's worthy brother the random talked about the the woman that washed jesus' feet and he talked about how that she went in there and and he said and it's always struck me because he said Simon was so busy and the other Pharisees were so busy doing Church things that they forgot to worship him they forgot to wash his feet I said let's let's not get so busy brother Joe at Christmas time that we'd forget what it's all about I I pray that I wouldn't get so busy and I've really I've struggled with that moan spirit and I I need to reset for the new year but sometimes I get so busy and I I preach uh this this year so many times here at the church and I look at that at the end of the year and I I take an account of myself and what have I done with the time that I've been here and and I do I'm always thinking have I been here enough have I taken off too much and it's really made me think what can I do to make sure sure that in all the busyness I'm here and I'm here more than most and and maybe maybe to my detriment I'm I've worked my my family half to death but I'll say this it's not about how busy we are but we want to make sure we get a chance we take the chance we take the opportunity when we have our services let's not take them for granted it's not how many we have but how do we what do we do do with the ones we have see my brother Ben everybody's not here but what did we do with the opportunity he came by we invited him to come and he came by when we invited him he always comes where he's invited then why don't we come and adore him why don't we just lay ourselves give ourselves to him would you bow your heads with me and close your eyes maybe there's a someone here who's never really given your heart to him in the way that you should maybe you're sitting here tonight and you're thinking well I just I've messed up and but why don't you just come in the City of Refuge why don't you just do that tonight it's not too late for [Music] you I know sometimes we we raise our kids with tender conscience and we should but sometimes they feel like when they do something a little bit wrong they oh they' send away their day of Grace no he still loves you why don't you come in the city of ref Refuge just take advantage of the opportunity Lord while you're here there may not be a bunch of other people here but while you're here let me Worship You Lord let me wash your feet at Christmas time I take the [Music] opportunity I don't want to pass it up let him be your place of safety at Christmas time would you do that Heavenly Father Lord Jesus my own heart today I I think Lord of how you've helped me so many times Lord that I've needed your help and I needed Lord that City of Refuge I'm so glad I've got it so glad I found it Lord help me to stay in it Lord I don't want to go out I don't want to I don't want to go out to the outside and skirt the edges Lord I want to stay within the boundaries of the word oh I pray you grant it Lord Lord I pray for these people today I pray you'd come and touch every heart I pray you'd touch the heart of the young people Lord my own children my Lord the other young couples oh God or the ones that are just starting maybe Christmas traditions and things Lord I I I I pray that they'd be happy and and find peace and comfort but Lord most of all would they make time for you I pray you'd help them Lord help them to make time for you at Christmas Lord May there be a reality of your presence Among Us Lord may we recognize that you are the reason Lord that we that we that we worship you at Christmas there is a reason there is a there is a cause I pray you granted today Lord I I just ask you to come accept our humble gift an appropriate gift or like the man that found the doll for his daughter he didn't have anything else he could give all he could think of was to get an appropriate gift at Christmas time oh God would you help us to give an appropriate gift which would be everything that we are it would only be appropriate Lord to not hold anything back but to give it all to you at Christmas time I pray you grant it today we thank you for it thank you for these people Lord I pray you bless them give them peace and joy and strength Lord until we meet again we pray in Jesus name amen thank you Lord Jesus amen let's just sing it now oh come let us him oh come let us

we're going to have brother Joel come and worship with you for just a moment but we'll have one service on Christmas Eve and if you can come if you're not doing traveling or something like that sure be glad to have you here if you got family or somebody maybe wouldn't come to church any other time of the year I believe it'd be an appropriate time from him to come and and maybe they'd want to find out about the reason that you are the way that you are it is Christ it's not about men it's not about preachers it's not even about this church it's about Christ at Christmas and so it'd be an appropriate time for that God bless you amen let's sing it all come let oh oh thank you Jesus Oh Come [Music] CHR the Lord one more time for he alone for he alone is worthy for he alone is worthy for
