you'd move me out of the way is your word begins to speak Lord when troubles common and trials Lord seems like rules our lives but Lord we can come aside for just a moment on a Wednesday night and hear your word and the trial seems less real the trouble seems less as we look at your word Lord and we know that your word is true Lord that the circumstances aren't true that the symptoms are lying vanities but your word is true Lord and I pray God that you'd make our your word real in all of our hearts for every person Lord that made a sacrifice to come on a Wednesday night order to watch this evening I pray that you just move in their lives and speak to them Lord individually to every person to my heart as well we pray Jesus name amen amen god bless you turn with me to revelations chapter five and verse eight get right into the word tonight and just trust that the Lord will do great things among us revelations chapter five and verse eight I love to preach on Wednesday nights because it's so good to see all of you here and I thought I don't love Sundays as well but it just seems like Wednesday night is just a special effort put forth by the people of God to be in the house of God and so I know you want to hear the word or you wouldn't be here and so we want to we want to get into the word tonight I want to speak to you on it just may seem like an odd title but I think you'll know soon where I'm going I want to speak to you on prayer and the open book prayer and the open book revelations 5:8 and when he had taken the book the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them harps and golden vials full of odours which are the prayers of saints and they sung a new song saying thou art worthy to take the book to open the seals thereof for that was slain and has two redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation and as made us unto our gods kings and priests we shall reign on the earth I pray the Lord would add his blessing to the word you may be seated this evening God's people have always believed in prayer and first Timothy 2:8 Paul tells us he says I will therefore that men pray everywhere lifting up holy hands without wrath and doubting Martin Luther told us when he came he said I have so much to do I'm gonna spend the first three hours in prayer that's a good mindset he said I've got so much to do that I need to spend three hours in prayer to get it done John Wesley said that the neglect of prayer is a grand hindrance to holiness brother branham says this in in faith in 1956 he said prayer changes things for prayer changes death to life do we believe that tonight for air changes sickness to health hey men so if you're sick pray prayer changed your sickness to health changes sinners to Saints if you're a sinner you can pray it's prayer he said you may laugh too much you may shout too much you may eat too much I know that's true for me but you'll never pray too much it said that in Africa and I know there's probably some African brothers that will hear this they do my heart was won a couple of years ago around this time when we went there and they say early on in Africa that converts to Christianity were earnest and they were regular in prayer and each one would have a spot in the thicket in the jungle where they would go and pour out their heart to God over time there would be a path that would wear to the place where they pray each one had his own place and as a result if one of these believers began to neglect prayer grass would begin to grow over the path and their brethren would look at them and they would say brother they said the grass grows on your path you've not been praying like you used to and I would present to you tonight that when you see a backslidden heart there's almost always an absence of Prayer it's like a leading indicator you know they have leading indicators for the economy that that there's if you see this indicator you know the economy is about to go down or to go up but prayer is a leading indicator of backsliding and it's something that we don't see because we don't make long prayers in the house of God we come here to hear the word but we pray in our closet at home and what Jesus told us to do but so we don't see it but yet it's evident in our lives if we don't pray I know to myself I can tell when I'm not praying like I should I remember some years ago we asked some young people what they struggled with the most and we thought well maybe it would be drugs or you wouldn't think message people would struggle with that but some do you'd think maybe sexual sin or different things and some older young people we asked them and almost everyone said prayer just having the time and taking the time and the opportunity to pray and talk to God during the day was the thing that they struggle with the most you know what I think that's probably true of all of us if there's something that would convict my heart if somebody would come and preach on prayer it would probably convicted my heart more than anything else because I know no matter how much that time I spend in prayer I wish I spent more time I wish that I that had taken more time because none of the time that I spent in prayer was wasted and some of the time I spent talking I talked too much some other time by the John that I spent doing other things I did those things too much but I never spent too much time in prayer you can go back over the history of the church and the history of God's people you can find that the men of God were prayer warriors people who were mightily used by God were prayer warriors and I'm so grateful and this was sparked sister Fritz a little bit my conversation that we had as we talked about it and certain things that she told me that she had prayed about and God answered her prayer I said God he's still answers prayer and we say that as if maybe he doesn't answer prayers often but what I want to tell you today even though it seems like today people pray less than they ever have what I'd like to show you by the scripture and the message is that prayer is not only still relevant but it's more relevant today than it's ever been and I will tell you and I believe I can tell you this by the scripture by the message of the hour that this is the hour of answer prayers that were actually living in the hour when all prayers get answered now of all the people who pray in the scripture in history the Bible records perhaps more instances of Jesus himself praying than any of the older New Testament Saints he was a man of Prayer and you think about it when we think of Prayer we think well I need prayer because I'm not what I should be but Jesus was exactly what he should be he never sinned never backs it and thought or deed never did anything like that though he was tempted he never strayed and he constantly stayed in prayer and in a few instances of that in Luke chapter 6 and verse 12 and I'm kind of laying a foundation for where we want to go tonight and they'll take me awhile to get there but then it won't take long so you just hang with me Luke chapter 6 and verse 12 it says it come to pass in those days that he went out in a mountain to pray and he continued all night in prayer to God now we don't make long prayers in public Jesus always went away from the crowd to pray but he did pray for a long time he prayed all night we're not commissioned as a church to do a whole night prayer meetings and to hold those that like they used to do and in some churches but brother Branham when if you'll watch him over the years he uses this against as an indictment almost of the Pentecostal people that they've gotten away from all-night prayer meetings he never told us to do that but he used it as an indictment of them that they'd gotten away from this and so and but the Branham uses it like an indicator like we said that he uses that and then a lack of attendance on Wednesday night when she talked about that used to be called prayer meeting night so now we have a regular service and then it would have been just a time for a lot of churches to be just a time of prayer and so they would come together and pray and the people quit attending on that night because they had better things to do brother branham uses that and here you him just as an example of it he said see they don't believe it he said they're getting away from it a by day falling farther and farther away he said you know that you don't have to think about it some of you old people and some of you tonight are old to some of us but age is relative you're only as old as you feel but he said some of you old people have been in this longer than I have he said look back a few years ago what it was all-night prayer meetings he said what do you do tonight let off on Wednesday night now again I'm not I'm not promoting that I'm not saying that's what we should do but he's using it as an indicator of how far they'd fallen he said what do you do tonight let off on a Wednesday night maybe about 6 o'clock or 7 o'clock maybe you don't even come to prayer meeting you want to go see some old filthy television thing or some woman married four or five times some man or some man married four or five times in and say you love God staying away from prayer meetings well that's just straight gospel preaching is then so and we find that jesus prayed all night and mark 1:35 it says in the morning rising up a great while before a day you went out and departed into a solitary place there pray mark 646 when he'd sent them the multitudes away he said we need sent him away he departed into a mountain to pray Luke 5 and 16 he would he withdrew himself into the wilderness and prayed why did he have to pray he prayed for others true but he also prayed for himself the Bible says that look at Hebrews chapter 5 and verse 7 says who in the days of his flesh when he'd offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death who was he praying for he's praying for himself he was praying for himself but he said not my will but thine be done but he he was heard listen what it says under him that was able to save him from death and was heard in that he feared now that word feared is actually means reverenced or sincerity he was heard because he was sincere and he reverence gone even though he was gone it's prayer life so impressed his disciples that they said teach us to pray now when God sent us a profit on this end time he gave him a commission and he said to him this he said that if he could get the people to believe you and be sincere when you pray so it's not just prayer but sincere prayer be sincere when you pray nothing would stand in the way of the prayer you talked about giving a man faith if an angel come and told you if you be sincere nothing will stand in the way of the prayer and so earlier brother branham's ministry he would actually go in the prayer lines he would pray for that person that child whoever it was until they were well and everyone that passed by and he found out later wasn't the right thing to do because God allowed some of those people to be sick like that but God he's so believed in his commission that everyone that passed by I believe could be well why because God told him that if you'll be sincere when you pray nothing will stand in the way of the prayer and he says not even cancer because cancer was the incurable disease that people were afraid of I think people can say that today if we'll be sincere if we'll be sincere if we pray and ask God there's nothing that can stand in the way because we come under we're not a prophet we were commissioned as a prophet but we come under that anointing of H now brother Brandon sees a vision I'm kind of walking through this as I said to kind of background what we're going to say he sees a vision of a serpent striking his friend and the serpent is striking and he said just sin and paradox he said just then the serpent turned to me when I said that looked at me again and a voice came from me and said you've been given power to bind him the worst or any that some power is then you've been given power to bind him the worst irini and i said well god what must I do he said there's one thing you must do you must be more sincere see you must be more sincere now we know from reading the message that sincerity isn't everything I know from reading the scripture that's true Cain was sincere but he was sincerely wrong as what we call it but sincerity is a necessary ingredient and I've said it this way you can be sincere and be wrong but you can't be insincere and be right all right it's just like if I have a 100 dollar bill in my pocket which I don't but if I had a hundred dollar bill in my pocket and I pulled it out if it looks like 100 dollar bill it could be a real hundred dollar bill could be a forgery it's one or the other but if I pull it out and it don't even look like 100 our bill we know it's not right sincerity could show up in a in in a wrong way but it could show up for the truth as well right now so he told that the angel told him you must be more sincere one thing you must do now I think I thought of this as I was studying today I thought of the woman in Memphis a little black mother she's standing there and in her sincerity she doesn't know anything she doesn't know anything like we know and she's standing a little woman in Memphis by herself and this this is something real that happened now you can believe it when it talks about Moses parting the Red Sea and those things that's wonderful we're talking about something God did in our hour and just a few years ago and God Hill does those things today it's not limited to brother Branham he's sealed he still works today but here we saw something that my prophet told that how that here was this woman standing there and she's the Lord revealed to her she was like the shoe to my woman but she said I found the shoe to my woman wearing is Elijah oh my and brother branham talked about how when he went in her house he said she was acquainted with prayer she knew who she was talking to she'd done that before he whisper down when someone is is a prayer a prayer when someone prays you know it because they've been there acquainted with that they're not uncomfortable with it they've talked to him before and here he said brother baron said that woman poor illiterate woman hardly knew where the next meal was coming from but her sincerity to the God that she loved could ground that plane hey Ben it could ground the plane that brother Branham was on hold that plane until the prayer of faith was prayed over her he said in that and over her boy he could take a man and move him so I couldn't go up in the plane the Spirit of God turning you around what did it the sincerity and prayer of that woman prayer still works now look but the man said or taught us that now their prayers that God doesn't answer right away we all know that there's prayer said that that seems like he never answers but he does answer our prayers but not always at the moment we ask him right some of you have prayed prayers that it took years to get an answer to but your witness today that you got this answer prayer could you stand on your knees and you you kept asking God and maybe at some point you've got an assurance in your heart and you believe that you held on to that and then when you believe that what happened God did it but maybe not right all at once now you might say well what happens to those prayers now when John is caught up in Revelation he sees a throne room in heaven and round about the throne were four and 20 seats in Revelation 4 or 4 he said and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting clothed in white raiment hat on their head crowns of gold now John gives us three clues to who they are he says the seats were Thrones he says have white raiment on they have crowns of gold no the Thrones are for over comers we find that Revelation chapter three and verse 21 to him that overcometh well I grant to sit with me in my throne then we know that couldn't be an angel or the random TARDIS said it wasn't it couldn't be an angel because angels don't overcome anything right that's us Thrones also speak of judgment that there would be judgment given and we know that will even the Saints will even judge angels but you can pick that up in Revelations 20 and 4 when he talks about the he said I saw Thrones and judgment was given unto them and in Daniel 7 and 9 where it talks about the Ancient of Days and I won't read it to save time but you can go back and look at that and you find that in that time he says I beheld till the thrones were cast down or placed and when that happened then the Ancient of Days did sit but Daniel when he sees it but the remm says when he saw the Thrones that's a judgment they were empty he's seen Thrones cast down and this gives us another clues to who these 24 elders are he said he saw the thrones cast down come down from heaven the ancient of time came down from heaven but when John saw it the throne was already occupied by Jesus he said on the Thrones for the disciples and the patriarchs redeemed was already fulfilled oh my so they had Thrones they had white raiment which is a type as we know of righteousness the bride is clothed in fine linen white and clean and the souls under the altar even are given white robes those Jews that died under Hitler and I mean they were given white robes so we find white raiment they also had crowns of gold in Revelations 2:10 it talks about that and you can read that where it says be thou faithful unto death and I will give thee a crown of life 1st Peter 5 and 4 talks about when the chief Shepherd shall appear you shall receive a crown of glory you shall receive a crown of glory now we're getting down to where we understand who these people are that it's not just random angels or some kind of a beast or some kind of power that sits before the throne of God but these are ones with with Thrones with crowns white raiment Paul says in 2nd Timothy 4:8 his fourth third slayed up for me a crown of righteousness which the Lord at the righteous which the Lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day and not to me only but unto all them also that love disappearing hey man you should sing the old song I'm gonna have a crown I'm gonna have a crown when the trumpet sounds I'm not much of a singer but you've heard it I think it's an old black spirit so I'm gonna have a crown what is that why because that's what the scripture says there's laid up for me a crown there's already one waiting for me won't be any crowns without heads to put put them on so now there's crowns and there's Thrones and there's white raiment my brother Brown who says in Revelation chapter 4 number 2 and I would encourage you to go if you have any questions about this tonight because I'm going through it hurriedly to get a point across to you but you can go in and read in Revelation chapter 4 number 1 and 2 and brother Brown talks about these things he says they were not angelic beings they were not heavenly beings they were redeemed men he said you can consider their dress you can consider their position you consider the songs and know that they were not angelic beings I could stop and preach on that for a while because the same thing is true of us when you look at the dress you look at the way at their position you look at the songs you look at everything about us were redeemed very bad so what the writer said you could look at what John saw and see these were redeemed means they were not angelic beings because they sang about Redemption amen now we know from the scripture 12 of these are identified in Matthew 19 to 28 when Jesus said verily I say unto you that you would you followed me in the regeneration when the Son of we'll sit in the throne of his glory you should also shall sit upon twelve Thrones judging the 12 tribes of Israel now brother Branham again explains that in questions and answers he got a question on this in 1957 on questions and answers on Hebrews number three and he says now an elder is an overseer he said no notice there were twelve patriarchs and twelve apostles twelve patriarchs and twelve apostles twelve from the Old Testament twelve from the New Testament he said and they were standing twelve on one side and twelve on the other he said now we found out that these and this is from Revelation chapter four he said we found out again and number chapter four number three he preached three sermons I believe are four sermons on that he said then we found out that these were elders he said an elder has never applied to an angel or any being he said it is a redeemed human being elders he said because throws crowns and Dominion has never referred to two angels but the crowns and Thrones so forth pertain to human beings and these elders was crowned and clothed sitting on Thrones he said and we found them over other parts of the scripture that they were the Twelve Apostles and they were the twelve patriarchs 24 of them he said which means 24 12 apostles 12 patriarchs and when he says we found them over in other parts of the scripture those are the scriptures that I read to you is the ones brother branham lists in that message now brother Branham is asked ask another question about these and questions and answers on the seals and I love that the confidence that this gives me in the message of the hour because he gets the question wrong you've all heard it if you've listened to the tape but the band gets it wrong and the Holy Spirit correct see I love that because it gives us confidence because we know every word brother baron said it's not infallible we know that because he's a man if you make him infallible you make him God there's no other way around it but he's a man we know he's a man but we also know God protected the message of the hour hey Ben we know the angel was with him when he preached these men and so here he's answering the question and he says in Revelation verse five nine he said who were these found singing when the lamb takes the book and these are these the raptured Saints he says no he said no if you notice these are not the Saints he said he had never claimed his property yet this is not the Saints if you notice they're the elders and the beasts and they sing and brother Branham goes on to another explains a little bit he goes on to another question and he comes back to he said there's something wrong there's something wrong that's just all there is to it there's something that's happened it gives me courage as a preacher for the Helen but the Stuart it gives me courage because the thing well if I would say something that would be wrong the Holy Spirit could correct that he's big enough to do that when we still believe that tonight so now he said there's something wrong that's just all there is to it there's something has happened something went wrong somewhere he says everybody feeling all right he said there ain't no sicknesses or nothing and a brother in the congregation says read that ninth verse again in Revelation 5 he said oh the question that I just answered now let's see said the right place and when he had open the book the four beasts of the four twenty elders fell down before the lamb now see some people think well you can never question anything that a prophet said but the Holy Spirit made him question right and now what he said he said now we need open the book the forward twenty elders and he reads it he said and they sang a new song that our worthy to take the book open the seals thereof that's as far as he read the first time he said here it is he said here it is I was wrong on that because they went on to say the how its redeemed us to God by that blood hey Ben so they couldn't be angelic beings couldn't be just throne room attendants right it had to stand for something had to stand for redeemed people the twelve patriarchs or twelve apostles and if brother Branham had said that then it would contradict what he had already taught on that you understand but he comes back and corrects it he says now he said now what do you think about that oh my said oh the presence of the Holy Ghost isn't here what is he said see I only read the first part of that verse now that's a dangerous thing to do to just read the first part of the verse that's where so many people get it wrong in there go to the message read the first part of a quote make a doctrine out of it you got to read the whole thing and when I preach you know I use a part of a quote I'll use a quote out of a quote I'll use a whole quote sometimes the whole paragraph but brother Branham didn't make the paragraphs we did that to try to make it readable you need to go back and listen to it or read it where you can understand it right Britta BAM didn't do the punctuation either you know we did that and I believe it's good it's the best that it could be but the Holy Spirit in you has to make you understand that thing or you never understand it and so he said only read the first part of the verse what the scripture says matters matters we've got to read all of it now our text in that vein as we look at the scripture mattering it matters it matters the word I'm doubting myself now it says in Revelations 5:8 since when he had taken the book the four beasts and the four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them harps now this is a different detail that he adds remember they before they had they were on Thrones and white raiment had crowns on their head that told us who they were that told us who they were now this tells us what they do right they have harps this is the tools of their trade if we could put it that way golden vials full of odours which are the prayers of saints we look at odor as a bad thing it's a it's like perfumes or incense golden vials full of incense that word vial is actually more accurately bowls we'll get to that in a moment so the prayers of the saints I want you to notice first just as an aside that they had harps and that wouldn't be a harp like what we see today if you go to a big concert hall and you listen to a harpist harping or if that's what you call that harping with their harps I guess and I think that's in the scripture harping with their hearts but you know if you see them harping playing their heart that's not the kind of harp they would have what they had actually it's closer in the family musical family to a guitar well some people don't believe in guitars in church but but it's actually more close to that the kind of harps that they would have cuz they would play it with a pick it was like a lyre that would be played with a pick and would be played loudly we know that because what John sees is the temple instruments that David created he invented instruments for the worship in the temple who saw was 33 and - he said praise the Lord with the harp it's that same instrument praise the Lord with the harp sing unto him with the psaltery and an instrument of ten strings and we kind of make a play on words on that today and say you can clap if you can't do nothing else but they actually David invented an instrument with ten strings and so he said seeing to him a new song play skillfully with a loud noise I know you all like that you musicians play skillfully we like that too with a loud noise for the word of the Lord is right now watch why do you play why did they play because the word of the Lord is right all these works are done in truth we we don't rejoice and worship and play because of some some kind of a beat or something that we're getting into or some kind of thing but we're doing it because the word is true right so we rejoice that's why it's message people it's different for most denominations because our time of worship comes at the end of the service not so much at the beginning although it's a an atmosphere that we have to send but the David does a good job doing that but you have to set that atmosphere and then at the end then you can worship why you've heard the word you've been lost by the water of the word and what is that the word of the Lord is right you're acknowledging that the word of the Lord is right all this works are done in truth so they had harps and vials or bowls now the definition of that word is a broad shallow bowl a deep saucer would be kind of like a you've seen these offering plates that are wider than they our deep like a saucer a deep saucer or a wide bowl now they're containers they contain something there's something stored up now remember I told you that not all prayers get answered all at once right in these bowls John sees that they have the prayers of the Saints in these bowls now think spiritually now but this is what John sees to represent that he said this is the bowls that they have prayers that could not be answered at the time they were prayed but would be answered in his predestined time now many prayers have already been answered and I think we could we could shout all around the church if we could really begin to think of some things that God has done you look back in the scripture and you find out Hannah was praying one time in the temple crying out to God because of her adversary weeping she wept in the temple and her prayer was answered she had Samuel Moses one time prayed to God and he said god I want to see your glory and God showed him he said like the back part of a man but he showed him just because he he pray it was jay-bez so I love that character and the scripture just says a few words about him but he prayed to God and he said Lord enlarge my territory Lords my territory I want to I want to take all of my land I want to do everything that you've given me to do enlarge my territory in God the Bible says God granted him his request the prayer of David when he went for forgiveness God answered that prayer Oh see God still answers prayer but what I want to show you is that this is the time when all prayers get answered so not just the prayers that we have that were answered right away but the ones that have been stored up look the David when he wept for forgiveness Daniel he was in the lion's den after you--after he refused to obey the illegal order of the king not to pray he refused to obey it and when he did they threw him in the Lions pit and he prayed to God and an angel come a pillar of fire stood between him and the Lions the prayer of the persecuted church when the saints and ax4 gathered together and the house was shaken where they were had when I had an all-night prayer meeting that time at John Mark's house and as they had the prayer meeting the angel went down someone said that the angel fetched Peter out of the jail but prayer fetched the angel because they had an all-night prayer meeting down at the house and here come here come Peter stumbling up to the door said hey what was it an answer to prayer hey bad you don't think God could still do that today I know he can still do that today the prayer of Paul and Silas when they were in jail we talked about how they saying and it's amazing how they sing to God but the Bible says they prayed and they sang they read the prayer while they were in jail and God an earthquake shook the jail down I read a story of Robert Mueller the great the great preacher who had orphanages and he never had any money never had enough money to go around to feed the children and so one morning he had a relative of his visiting a young lady she was visiting him and and that morning they had no food at all to give the orphans and so Robert Mueller said took her by the hand he said let's go see what God will do he took her inside the the place they had all the tables set for all the orphans and no food and they sat down and Robert Mueller bowed his head and prayed to the Lord we give you thanks for the food we're about to receive you talk about faith we give you thanks for the food we're about to receive and when he did there come a knock on the door and a baker stood at the door said all night I couldn't sleep so I woke up at two o'clock in the morning and started baking bread for the children I couldn't think of anything else to do and so he'd come in and about the time the door had closed another knock come on the door and a milkman stood there and he said my my court broke down in front of the in front of the orphanage I'd like to give the orphans some milk God answers prayer I may have told you before but I remember a time when I was young and I didn't have no money I didn't know how to handle money and I was sixteen years old and I went to preach somewhere and I knew if the pastor gave me an offering if you give me a check I couldn't make it back home I was that poor I didn't have any money no credit cards no backup and all through that time I telling the brothers I never had to I never had to ask anybody for money God always blessed me and I'll never forget that there was a man just happened to show up at church I've seen him maybe five or six times in my life but he become my friend because of the things that happened I went and was able to pray with him before he passed away because he happened to be near where I lived at that time but a man showed up at church had never seen me before and he walked up to me as I'm leaving puts a hundred dollars in my pocket my front pocket which felt like a million dollars to me and I just went cuz I was just stupid enough to believe that God would do something for me oh my God has a way when there seems to be no way he still answers prayer he still responds to thanks they men there's prayers we could go back we can look at the prayers of saints church we don't understand how much that our church and us being here relies on the prayers of those who went on who prayed prayers in this church that that to keep a church here that there would be a place for the gospel to be preached and so we go through trials and tribulation you don't know that prayers may be prayed years ago and we're scored up until the moment that could they could be fulfilled and now all the sudden they're being fulfilled you can go back and think of saints that were prayer warrior says brother ruby you could go back and think of sister Browne different ones that are prayer warriors and and and stayed on their knees and you knew it and as they stayed on their knees the prayers of the saints were stored up and we're still benefiting from those prayers today we don't intercede with them now they're going on to their reward but while they were here they interceded for us oh my now but then there's been prayers that you've prayed and doesn't seem like there's been any answer and some of you talked to me about those things and and it seems like well there's just no no movement there's no answer but they're in the bowl understand they're in the bowl there's none lost whatever those bowls are they're big enough that they hold every prayer all the prayers of the Saints they're in the bowl now those prayers were stored up for a time for a time and the Bible tells us in Romans 8:22 that he said for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now he said not only they but ourselves also so not just sozin in the past not just the earth itself not just those people who live back there but ourselves who have the firstfruits of the Spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of our body see there's a prayer brother Ruby prayed that hasn't been answered yet that's a prayer for a resurrection right even though they have a body but there's a prayer for a resurrection there's a prayer to be gathered with loved ones a prayer for a rapture sister Brown prayed for that but a bride and prayed for that all these down do you can think about your own family and those that have went on and those that you knew were prayer warriors they prayed a prayer well a prayer has not happened yet maybe better but this is the hour when we can be confident excuse me when damage Sapulpa but this is the hour when we can be confident that our prayers will be answered now because here what did this what did it say go back to I don't have it right here but go back to Revelation chapter 5 what did he saying I keep reading and I kept reading it to myself today as we go back to revelations chapter 5 and verse 8 that when he had taken the book I just stopped there when did the elders fall down before the lamb and brother Branham tells us and we'll get to that in a moment that that's when the those prayers were poured out those bowls were empty and when did they fall down before the lamb they fell down when he had taken the book are you with me now he took the sealed book why he's going to open and he comes to take the book of brother Branham says he comes to claim his own hay bed now he comes forth in that he says in the breach to take his claims now oh my comes forth to take his claims now he had done the kinsman were he'd come down and become man and died he done the kids of an ork of redemption but it not his yet called for his claim now what I bear with me for just a moment I won't hold you much longer bear with me for just a moment hang with me because this I believe it's important if you just catch it that he's not yet it has yet called for his claim but now he comes on the scene to claim his rights hey Ben he said oh my for which he was famed for his becoming a kinsman to man to die in his place to redeem him but the elder was right when he saw it was a lion the other called him a lion because he had been a lamb and intercessor a bloody lamb but now I watched the picture that he's painting now he is coming forth as a lion they bet what time are we living in now well the Stewart he is coming forth as a lion his days of intercession is over when you see this what is it what is it all these things begin to take place angels fall down or rather the torch when the elders fall down at his feet and the four beasts fall down line because he's come to claim his rights and it's during that time when every prayer is answered I'm not trying to tell you something that's not there go back and lit and read and really study it out many prayers were answered in the days of his intercession but there were certain prayers and specifically those that said come Lord Jesus every bed they've been praying that ever since he left come Lord Jesus every saint that went down went down an expectation and prayer that that would happen and this is the time there were certain prayers that had to be stored up now the Bible says speaking of the Old Testament Saints these all died in faith not having received the promises but having seen them afar off were persuaded of them and embraced him and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth so you look at those four and twenty elders here were twelve who were represented by the twelve the twelve tribes of Israel and those twelve tribes were there and those twelve patriarchs were there they represent that that lost people that had already been gone and they went down believing that there would come a redeemer but they never saw it but they went down praying for it he told me prayer doesn't work and a redeemer came and so that's why he said that on one side Daniel sees him and he sees just the Ancient of Days sitting there and the Thrones were set but no one was in them but on this side here are the four and twenty elders with robes white raiment why a redeemer had come they couldn't have that there were deep Redemption here but we have it here they had to wait for it for him to come now look when all creation but the browser says was groaning no one knew what to do John was weeping here come the lamb walked over and this book was in the hands of the original owner because man had fell and lost it no man was able to take it anymore to redeem the earth no priest broke nothing as I said but the land come up no marry no say this for sake that the Lamb come up but he's saying took the book out of the right hand of him that said upon the throne see I will sit between you and the Lamb I don't mediate between you in the land you have a mediator you have a lamb I think sometimes we put people in between they need to get out of the way we need to place them out of the way they don't belong there pastor doesn't belong between you and the lamp a person not even a prophet belongs there only Christ it's the mediator between God and man but now look he said when they seen there was a redeemer all the souls under the altar altar when the angel from the elders when everything's seen it when this is done now watch when this is done and yet lays in the future tonight he's a mediator and I watched what he had said he's coming now tonight he's a mediator but he is coming to this he is coming to this watch and when he had taken the book the four beasts and the four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them harps and golden vials full of odours which are the prayers of the saints he said that's those that's under the altar now but random is later it's revealed to him in the fifth seal that it's not the Jews under or it's not the one that are the altar in the fifth seal but it is those that have already gone on the ones that are the altar in the fifth seal is those Jews that were killed under hill or in Eichmann but he said that's so so it's under the altar that had prayed they'd been then I prayed you said my prayers don't matter here were those 24 owners that fell down before the lamb and they pray they had prayed long ago they they held the bowls of all the prayers of the Saints and they had prayed for now notice what they prayed for two things they pray for redemption and prayed for resurrection thank the Lord and the redemption had already been answered because he was already he is already a bloody lamb but now he's coming forward to take his Co make his claims and when he comes to make his claims what is he been he's not only coming for redemption but for resurrection this is the hour that we live in oh my and here these elders are pouring out their prayers because now he said we've got a representative amen they're pouring out their prayers because now thank the Lord we've got a representative we've got a kinsman in heaven that's come forth to make his claims oh my those hammers taken the book he's leaving mercy for judgment and during that time they poured out those prayers as he came as he took the boat and as he come forth to be changed from a lamb to a lion they poured out the prayers now the Jews under the fifth seal prayed remember they prayed they cried out to God well for for vengeance you go back and looking you go study this I'm not gonna preach all this because it's not mine did tonight but you go and study on the trumpets and these things and how that they prayed for those things that are coming they prayed for vengeance and that'll be there'll be a time when those prayers are answered because he said not not now it'd be a little while yet there'll be 144,000 come as well that have to die right there there some others coming but now these prayers will be answered so even the prayers of those who are given White Rose are answered if those prayers are answered of Jews who never never accepted Christ but died under Hitler indictment if that prayers answered for vengeance how much more is the prayer brother Dan evil redeemed a child of God but now this is the time for all prayers to be answered look it won't be very long and there won't be any prayer left prayed by a Christian to be answered there's coming a resurrection and a rapture that's that is our goal that's what we're coming to that's what we're even a part of its what's in us now we're coming to that place for the Stuart and so when we come to that place there's gonna be no prayer unfulfilled cuz little bowls will be poured out I thank God for His mercy thank God for His answer to prayer but now the prayers of the Jews are yet to come many things yet to come for the Jews but God is turning from the Gentile church before the bride our prayers will be answered now look he said well when does this happen well but the matter said what's happened on now sunset God confirming his word now you can either believe this or not but it's what a prophet of God told us he said that's what all this noise is about notice it's God fulfilling his promise word again of revelation 10 1 2 7 and in the days of the sounding of the seventh angels message the mystery of God should be finished what did he do but the revelation 10 1 2 7 one foot on the land one foot on the earth and one foot on the sea one foot on the earth and he said time will be no more he said there'll be no more today now think about that in a different way than you thought about it before there's no more delay to the answer of prayers baby bed this is the hour when where things are speeding up then what should we expect today we should expect God to keep his word if he if he kept his word for Robert Mueller if he kept his word for for Paul and Silas if he kept his word for in the book of Acts if he kept his word when Jesus himself prayed that not my will but thine be done if he kept his word to be answered prayer what about today when we're living at the very end when the fulfillment of these sayings is coming to pass listen brother branham said the hidden mystery of revelation ten one two seven the last message to the last Church ages fulfills exactly in this age the day when the Son of man shall be revealed and he goes on down you'll find there's a couple paragraphs in between this but in paragraph 152 if you go study it he said the God of heaven promised the evening time would have evening lights three years ago this mystery was a prophecy what time is it sir but now it's history what did he preaching what time is it sir an angel had come down revelation ten one two seven he said it was a mist it was a prophecy now it's history he said but now it's history it's past the promises fulfilled what time is it sir what's this attraction God fulfilling his word what's he doing he's answering prayer today yes he is no the angel swore and he goes on he said what's this attraction he says God fulfilling his word he's the same yesterday today and forever now as we said the angels where there would be no more delay this is the hour of answered prayers we prayed for a rapture we prayed for a change of body and there may be some here god forbid but there may be something would go by way of the grave and that prayer be stirred up in that bowl but this is the hour it happens during this time are you with me now God stores those prayers that happens during this time when the bride says come what bride is that not just the living right on the earth but the bride down to the history cries oh come quickly amen and it couldn't be revealed to them because they had to feel it like it was right there and they felt like he was coming with a JC right there and Paul said Paul felt like he was coming just around the corner but this was the end time it was but 2000 years later here we stand again and we look at it as the end times and it is but now we're not looking at it from the front but we've turned around we're looking not at prophecy expected but prophecy fulfilled just like brother Ram could turn around in in is this what is the attraction on the mountain he could turn around and look and see not just prophecy like he could when he preached the sermon what time is it sir wasn't a question anymore but he answered the question what time is it sir was a question but what is his attraction on the mountain he said it's fulfilled the prayers been answered the questions been answered God fulfilling his word so the bowls if you're going in Revelation 16 you'll find those bowls of judgment that are ready to be poured out vials of judgments and that's the prayer of those under the altar it's about to be answered also under the seven trumpets and that's not our gospel is not where we preach to the Jews but the prayers of the saints a lot of answer it under the trumpets or under the under the vials they're answered under the Seventh Seal don't read revelations 8:1 and then read I challenge you read revelation 8 1 and then read verses eight three through six what does it talk about answered prayers an angel with prayers and incense and the golden altar I'm not trying to make something out of it it's not but what is it this is the time if there ever was a time to pray and to believe that your prayers would be answered it's this day do we believe that tonight we have seen God fulfill his word the book has been open and in that hour in this hour as he makes his claims hey man how do you know he'd come to make his claims because he come and made his claim with me he come and made his claim with you you see your identity in the message of the hour as he makes his claims what happens it shows you the book has been open and in that hour those bowls are poured out read it again when he had taken the book when he had taken the book the four beasts and the four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them harps and golden vials for voters which are the prayers of saints there is coming a day when the prayers of the Jews enter the altar will be poured out I'm living in the fulfillment of the Gentile age he's making his claims what is our prayer today our prayers come quickly and we're gonna see it answered you see what time you living in then anything is possible anything is possible what did but the Browns show had he right under the third pole that he or she had prayed maybe all all them boys life she'd prayed they'd be saved but under the identification of the spoken word in the third pole what her brother Brown said you can have them hey Ben you can have the desire of your heart listen there's things that we've been praying for for a long time but we're coming to the hour we're at the hour were in the hour when we can have them that if we've ever prayed we should pray more if we've ever believed it those Saints back there believed and then saw all the things that they saw how much more should we see today but the devil fights your prayer life he fights you he tries to make you cold he tries to make you where you have no time for prayer he tries to fill it up with everything else why because he wants to make sure because he knows the prayers were about to be answered he wants to keep you from praying to the Jaypee because he knows that his time is short prayers are about to be answered now is the time to let him make his claims and believe that my prayers will be answered very soon musicians come could we stand together see that wasn't too difficult you believe your prayers what we mean will be answered every one of them not one is lost are stored up and you could think maybe it's something simple in your own life but you've been praying about it and it's just stored up for a while it's there but it's stored up God's gonna answer it at the predestined time there's coming in answer to prayer what should we be praying for that as we get as we see what how are we live in what time it is we can look and we can see that in this hour we should be praying more and more Lord come quickly because that's ultimately the final prayer for the Gentile church to be answered come quickly Lord hey man do you believe he's gonna do it hey man bow your heads together with me I apologize if I've confused you I didn't mean to do that but you go back and study it go back and study and you'll find out that God will answer your prayer today what is it that you have in your heart maybe you're holding something that you've been praying about for a long time I pray tonight that you would take comfort in knowing that God answers prayer Heavenly Father we hold these things before you today we keep these things in in our hearts Lord but like Daniel he prayed for all those days and then you said Lord that you heard him on the first day Lord you heard us the very first time that we prayed for our children [Music] very first time we pray we come to the message of the hour and all of a sudden we begin to pray and call out to God and we thought Lord come quickly getting tired of the bad news getting tired or dealing with the things I have to deal with every day lord I want you to come getting tired of fighting the devil lord it's time I feel like it's time we don't control that the prayer is the very first time that you prayed it is stored up this is the hour when the bowls are poured out the vials are poured out this is the hour when you can get what you ask for if we could just believe that but Satan would try to take you away from that and say well I I just my prayers are ineffective maybe you feel lesser than a previous generation because you don't pray as much and you don't maybe cry as much you don't shout as much but that's not what it's about a prayer like Moses is just said Lord show me your glory God showed it to him you say Lord give me my children Caleb said give me my Mountain hey Brett let it be a prayer that goes up to God and may you be like that that woman in Memphis when she said I believe Lord that I'm the shooter my woman if I'm the shooter my woman there's got to be an Elisha somewhere hey bet be sincere in your prayers Lord I believe you're gonna do what you promised you would do this is the end time when all of those prayers are stored up those prayers will be answered pray pray more you know when you don't pray enough every time every time you get the opportunity pray when we get the opportunity as a church we should pray every time we have a chance we should pray why because this is the hour when prayers are answered don't look back with bitterness and say well I I prayed for something years ago and it's never been never really happened like I thought it would store it up it's there maybe won't be answered in the way that you thought it would just like they prayed Paul prayed Lord come in my generation the prayer was stored up but it wasn't in his generation being ours I believe that he believed it would be in his we believe it will be in ours but now we're looking backward we're seeing the fulfillment of prophecy let that be your prayer tonight Lord come quickly Lord I've got family I've got friends that are in need lord I I see it I see the ones that are out of the Ark of safety Lord answer my prayer today I believe you're a prayer answering God if I'll speak it it'll happen Heavenly Father or we lift our prayers to you today all right it doesn't have to be a great thing doesn't have to be loud hearted something that's sincere from our heart something that comes from deep down within Lord our heart speaks something groaning inside of us we crawled Lord waiting we haven't seen a new body yet we haven't seen that so we pray where summers went by way of the grave there's some who come but Lord that the fullness of their prayers has not yet been meant because there will come a time when we're caught up together to meet them to meet you in the air Oh Lord I pray that you would answer every prayer tonight Lord if it's just a whispered for hair if it's tear rolling down a cheek if it's just a moment Lord do we spend maybe this morning just standing at the dishes or standing making breakfast the sister began to pray and as she began to pray a dear old energy field Lord Lord take care of my children today take care of my family or you can answer that prayer this is the hour of answered prayers help us to believe it Lord we thank you for it thank you for all that you do for us as a church we don't deserve it Lord we're unworthy Lord we can fall down like the four and twenty elders did we could fall down we could say worthy is the Lamb who was slain whose redeemed us by your blood who's made us to be kings and priests to reign on the earth we're so grateful heart we can fall down at your at your feet say you're worthy we're not worthy it's you're worthy answered our prayers thank you for it hard I pray that somehow or does it's giving me encouragement but I'm a poor vessel to the Lord to convey that on but I pray your Holy Spirit would go down to each heart father and that they would be encouraged and know you answered their prayer and if father we pray in Jesus name let's just worship him for a moment before we go thank you lord thank you lord me [Music] Oh me but your friend here'll she liked the word saturate my thirsty son Oliver shown me for my cup McGann the make

that themselves there's no way they didn't deserve this place they didn't deserve to be claimed by him but he came anyway made his claims that's the hour and we live in under the opening of the word
