[43:18] few years probably goes back about eight
[43:19] or 10 years for me uh brother John every
[43:22] time I've went to Africa he's been there
[43:24] with me and uh I preach his EAS Easter
[43:27] convention uh last year I was planning
[43:30] on going uh this year as well and
[43:33] preaching with him and benine but the
[43:35] John was a great man of God he was a uh
[43:39] he was a leader there in his country in
[43:41] Togo and uh was well known all around
[43:45] the world he had spread the gospel to uh
[43:48] many different countries in Africa in
[43:49] fact fact he lost his daughter on a
[43:52] missionary trip uh he was a real
[43:54] missionary he he really loved this
[43:57] message had been pastoring for probably
[43:59] close to 40 years he was in his 60s and
[44:02] just passed away unexpectedly this

[44:15] things but uh he's in a better place and
[44:18] every one of us have to go that route
[44:20] we'll either go by grave or by the
[44:21] Rapture but I'm looking forward to
[44:23] seeing brother John again and I trust
[44:26] I'll see every one of you there as well
[44:28] and that's what we want to do it's why

[45:19] so you just pray for the church and and
[45:21] the family and I'm sure God will take
[45:24] care of them as well let's Stand
[45:26] Together
[45:28] just had to get my composure for a
[45:32] moment Genesis chapter
[45:35] 13 as we continue to speak about Abraham
[45:39] today Genesis
[45:42] 13-14 and the Lord said unto
[45:45] Abram after that lot was separated from
[45:49] him lift up now thine eyes and look from
[45:53] the place where thou Thou Art northward
[45:56] and South norward and Eastward and
[45:59] Westward yes other words look in every
[46:01] direction as far as you can see all all
[46:05] the land which thou seest to thee will I
[46:07] give it and to thy seed
[46:10] forever I will make thy seed as the dust
[46:14] of the earth so that if a man can number
[46:17] the dust of the earth then shall thy
[46:19] seed also be numbered arise walk through
[46:24] the land in the length of it and in the
[46:26] breadth of it of it yes I will give it
[46:28] unto thee do you believe that promised
[46:30] today he said I will give it unto thee
[46:33] then Abram removed his tent and came and
[46:35] dwelt in the plain of mamory which is in
[46:37] Hebron and built there an altar unto the
[46:40] Lord I pray the Lord would add his
[46:41] Blessing to the word this morning you
[46:44] may be
[46:49] seated lot is Abram's nephew his
[46:53] brother's son was a part of his father
[46:55] Tara's household
[46:59] when God called Abram by Grace he
[47:02] commanded him to leave his country and
[47:04] his Kindred and specifically his
[47:07] father's house he said get out of thy
[47:09] country from thy Kindred and from thy
[47:12] Father's House unto a land that I will
[47:15] show thee and so he was specifically
[47:18] commanded to do that his father's house
[47:20] would be his Nativity his Kindred his
[47:23] Nativity his Kindred uh his uh his
[47:27] father's uh household and we know that
[47:29] lot was a part of that now we don't know
[47:32] why Abraham did not fully obey God at
[47:36] that time but I I think it may have been
[47:38] for the right reasons or he thought that
[47:41] it was the right reasons because he
[47:43] wanted to take care of lot he probably
[47:45] felt close to lot didn't want to hurt
[47:47] him and he may have felt responsible for
[47:49] him since lot's father Abraham's brother
[47:52] had passed away and yet we know that
[47:54] Abraham and lot were of different values
[47:57] in God's
[47:58] economy and brother brandom says it like
[48:01] this he put it so wonderfully he said
[48:03] all these Believers he said so he
[48:05] identifies lot in this place as a
[48:07] Believer he said all these Believers as
[48:09] we could go on for hours he said all
[48:11] these were like a bunch of change out of
[48:13] your pocket in God's hands he said you
[48:17] pull out a bunch of change there's
[48:19] pennies nickels dimes quarters half
[48:22] dollars dollars all in coins he said now
[48:26] that's what the world is in God's hand
[48:28] there is some people that just can't
[48:30] have a penni's worth of it and God can
[48:32] only use them in a penny way he said
[48:35] that's all they can buy he said don't
[48:38] reject them right don't reject them
[48:41] Abraham's separating from lot was not
[48:44] Abraham rejecting
[48:46] lot right what he had to separate from
[48:49] was
[48:50] unbelief right his journey the way that
[48:52] he's going as we talked about it last
[48:54] week it was an incredible uh thing that
[48:57] Abraham had to believe and lot did not
[49:00] have the capacity to believe like
[49:02] Abraham did he just didn't have that in
[49:05] him and yet he would could be a valuable
[49:08] part a part of God's economy but not
[49:10] like Abraham and so God had to make them
[49:13] go their separate ways even though
[49:17] Abraham had to go his way and lot had to
[49:19] go his way but it had to be a a place
[49:22] had to come that place and yet Abraham
[49:24] had to continue to love him and and to
[49:27] care for him brother B said don't reject
[49:29] them if they can't believe the real
[49:30] truth don't turn them down don't kick
[49:33] them out and say they're not in it
[49:34] because God uses pennies
[49:38] sometimes and I've told you many times
[49:40] before but darl Ward early on when I was
[49:42] probably 17 years old he told me brother
[49:44] Ben you may only be a dime worth of
[49:47] Minister that may be all that you'll
[49:48] ever be he said but if you only give God
[49:50] a nickel he said you're robbing God of
[49:52] five
[49:53] cents right and so that that that's the
[49:55] truth like our ad itude towards that
[49:57] matters God uses pennies sometimes Lord
[50:01] whatever I am let me be all of it let me
[50:04] be everything you've called me to be let
[50:06] me let me strive to enter into the
[50:08] kingdom of God and give the effort
[50:10] that's needed I know it's only by Grace
[50:12] I know it's only by election that I can
[50:13] be saved but let me put forth the effort
[50:16] that that would make me fulfill your
[50:18] will oh
[50:19] God so so lot was just a penny he said
[50:23] now he said Abraham was a silver dollar
[50:27] now what made the difference between the
[50:29] penny and the silver dollar wasn't
[50:31] natural birth they were closely related
[50:34] it wasn't gen genes physical genes what
[50:37] was it it was election all right
[50:40] election is the only thing that made the
[50:42] difference between Abram and lot right
[50:44] and so but yet brother R said it took a
[50:46] hundred lots to make an Abraham he said
[50:50] a 100 carnal Believers will never stand
[50:53] in the presence of a genuine Christian
[50:55] that's separated from the car things of
[50:57] the world living in Christ Jesus where
[50:59] the word can flow through him oh that's
[51:01] what I want to be I want to be one of
[51:03] those genuine Christians this morning
[51:05] that God can use as a silver dollar in
[51:08] the age that we live
[51:10] in h you know uh there's a theme park in
[51:14] Branson called Silver Dollar City and
[51:16] the reason it's called Silver Dollar
[51:18] City is because they used to give change
[51:20] there in silver dollars and when they
[51:22] would give change they did that on
[51:24] purpose so that people when they went to
[51:26] the gas stations when they went to the
[51:28] grocery stores that they would when they
[51:30] showed up with a silver dollar they said
[51:31] oh you've been to Silver Dollar City
[51:34] because they were using that money that
[51:36] they' given them which wasn't commonly
[51:37] used and don't you realize that's what
[51:39] we are we belong to God and when PE when
[51:42] we when we live our lives in the world
[51:45] people see who we are and where we came
[51:47] from you don't belong to Silver Dollar
[51:49] City you belong to the Eternal City you
[51:52] belong to the New Jerusalem amen you're
[51:56] a part of the Bride aren't you glad for
[51:57] that today so he said 100 Lots couldn't
[52:01] make an Abraham he can only take a
[52:03] Penny's worth that's all he's God right
[52:05] he said so you see people that say I
[52:07] don't believe in healing I don't believe
[52:09] in these things just know it's a penny
[52:10] but just let him alone all right just a
[52:13] Penny's worth so that's all he can buy
[52:15] don't stop him just let him alone he
[52:17] said remember that's just all the
[52:19] farther he can go right so that that's
[52:21] all that's all he can do just let him
[52:23] alone brother brandom titles uh that
[52:26] sermon that we was preaching that in
[52:28] God's word calls for a total separation
[52:31] from
[52:32] unbelief it does not say a total
[52:34] separation from
[52:36] unbelievers I I think we misinterpret
[52:38] that sometimes although at times an
[52:42] unbeliever can have such an influence in
[52:44] our lives that we we we we've got to go
[52:47] our separate ways there is a time for
[52:50] that and yet it is not a total
[52:52] separation from unbelievers cuz how you
[52:53] going to do that you couldn't even go to
[52:55] church
[52:58] right you could even live with yourself
[53:00] right right because because in our Even
[53:03] in our own selves we're a three-part
[53:05] being right we're a body flesh and
[53:07] spirit you could say it like this you're
[53:08] a you're a believer in your soul your
[53:11] spirit is kind of a make believer right
[53:15] because it it it can go either way and
[53:17] your flesh is an
[53:20] unbeliever right you can't even live
[53:21] with yourself but but so it's not
[53:24] separating from the people as much as it
[53:26] is separating from the unbelief right
[53:29] but but yet lot and Abraham had to go
[53:31] their separate ways now he just wasn't a
[53:34] a believer of the caliber of Abraham
[53:37] brother random calls him in other places
[53:38] a carnal believer or a make believer he
[53:41] said there is always three classes of
[53:43] people in a religious gathering
[53:44] Believers make Believers and unbelievers
[53:47] always them three he said and there they
[53:49] was there is the unbelieving sodomite
[53:51] the make believer lot and Abraham the
[53:53] elected church again he said another
[53:56] Street three classes of people the
[53:57] unbeliever make believer and believer he
[53:59] said now the unbeliever was the sodomite
[54:01] the make believer was Lot the normal
[54:03] Church the denominational church he said
[54:06] Abraham represented the church elected
[54:08] called out separated he wasn't in Sodom
[54:11] to begin with he said Oh my he said
[54:14] watch that angel never went to that
[54:15] other church he come to the elected
[54:18] Church oh Church you realize we we're
[54:21] walking a repeat brother brand said
[54:22] every believer walks that repeat of
[54:24] Abraham's Journey we're walking a repeat
[54:26] Fe of Abraham's Journey as we're walking
[54:28] by faith and with the angel has come to
[54:30] us and the son of man has been revealed
[54:33] in our
[54:34] day and so we we've had that experience
[54:37] with God and all we're waiting on now is
[54:39] the the change of our bodies aren't you
[54:41] glad for that today brother B said
[54:43] you've received your last sign and now
[54:45] we're waiting on the change of the body
[54:47] yes so what we need then is to separate
[54:51] from unbelief right usually within our
[54:55] own hearts
[54:57] right that's what I want to do this
[54:59] morning I just want Faith to be there
[55:02] look brother brandham talks about this
[55:04] he said Abraham is all Mortals not an
[55:06] immortal man not a man that can't make a
[55:09] mistake but constantly made mistakes but
[55:14] no matter how many mistakes he made his
[55:16] anchor still held for he had the promise
[55:20] he said so he took with him Sarah he
[55:23] took lot he took his daddy and as long
[55:26] as they was with him God could not bless
[55:27] him he said the old man finally died and
[55:30] they buried him he went on up a little
[55:32] farther and lot backslid and you know
[55:34] what happened there and then he
[55:36] separated himself from him Oh my he said
[55:39] then God appeared to him again and said
[55:41] now Abraham look all over the ground
[55:43] it's all yours when he made the right
[55:45] choice that's it separate yourself from
[55:48] everything so Abraham is elected but
[55:50] he's got to make a choice that will
[55:52] cause him to receive the benefits of his
[55:55] election
[55:56] but God knew what choices you would make
[55:59] yes and he knew what before he ever
[56:01] chose you he knew exactly what you how
[56:03] you would separate from unbelief and you
[56:06] would believe the word of the
[56:08] hour but even Sarah you say well Sarah's
[56:12] included in there well yes but Sarah was
[56:15] Abraham's wife she was an unbeliever too
[56:19] yes sir right she she laughed when God
[56:23] spoke but yet oh my yet God would not do
[56:27] away with her Abraham could not separate
[56:29] from her because they were they were one
[56:33] and brother BR typed that to us I'm
[56:34] getting kind of ahead of myself this
[56:35] morning but brother B typed that to us
[56:37] he said God could not destroy us when we
[56:40] disbelieve he said because we're part of
[56:43] him oh I'm so grateful for that today
[56:46] yes but we want to separate from
[56:48] unbelief yeah now uh brother brand said
[56:52] you know what happened there he
[56:53] separated himself he made the right
[56:54] choice he said maybe that's the reason
[56:56] some of us are not getting along so well
[56:58] we're holding on to things we ought to
[56:59] let go in the separation a little doubt
[57:03] a little
[57:04] Wonder right yeah a little
[57:07] skeptic wonder if it's right I read this
[57:10] quote to you last week but I'm just
[57:11] laying a a foundation some folks lay a
[57:14] foundation never finish the sermon but
[57:17] we're just kind of trying to get
[57:18] somewhere this morning he said but how
[57:20] could it be wonder if it's right could
[57:22] this be could that be cut loose this
[57:24] morning oh if could just we could just
[57:27] do that this will cut loose no let that
[57:29] little doubt go let that little skeptic
[57:31] go well I wonder if the message is right
[57:33] I wonder if brother the been a real
[57:35] Minister I wonder if the church is right
[57:37] just let all that go say Lord I want to
[57:40] receive whatever you've got for me today
[57:42] I want whatever you've got I don't want
[57:44] one Speck of doubt in my heart yes sir
[57:48] yes you you don't want to defend your
[57:50] doubts let them go cut them loose yes
[57:54] you may like them you know it may be
[57:56] your little nephew you know that you
[57:57] like and you want to keep him around but
[57:59] let him
[58:00] go are you with me now you might as well
[58:03] there's nobody so miserable as somebody
[58:05] who who who's not really living it and
[58:07] they know it or they're or or they're
[58:09] holding grudges and they know it and yet
[58:12] they still trying to serve God and
[58:13] trying to go to church and do a try and
[58:15] just let it go let it go there's no
[58:18] reason to hold on to it just let It Go
[58:20] Let it Loose and let God fill you with
[58:22] faith this morning he called you you're
[58:24] he knows you're able to do that that
[58:26] yeah amen that's good now he said cut it
[58:28] Loose this morning Hebrews 12 said let
[58:30] us lay aside every weight every weight
[58:33] and the sin that does so easily beset us
[58:35] the sin what is that the unbelief that
[58:37] does so easily beset us let us run with
[58:40] patience the race that set before us
[58:42] looking to Christ the author and
[58:44] finisher of our faith so again he's
[58:46] talking about separating from unbelief
[58:49] brother BR said God said Abraham in
[58:51] order to walk with me you've got to
[58:54] separate yourself from the rest of them
[58:56] he said uh he said God Demands a total
[59:00] separation but you want to bring a lot
[59:02] of the world along with you he said when
[59:04] you come in and receive the Holy Ghost
[59:05] you say well I was taught to be this and
[59:08] I was taught the days of Miracles has
[59:10] passed he said you better leave that
[59:11] thing
[59:13] behind as long as that holds with you
[59:16] it'd be like Abraham started out with
[59:18] lot and his father there's trouble in
[59:20] the camp yes see you you you've taken
[59:23] ideas from psychologists and philos
[59:26] opers and and and from parents and from
[59:29] and from your upbringing and from a
[59:31] denominational church somewhere and you
[59:33] got to separate from that before you can
[59:35] ever be helped by the gospel because
[59:38] it's it's a it's against the word of God
[59:41] and so anything now some your parents
[59:42] may be helpful but anything that they
[59:44] say that's against the word Let It Go
[59:47] your family may be helpful but anything
[59:49] they say that's against the word let it
[59:50] go this word's got to be Paramount in
[59:53] our lives it's got to have preeminence
[59:55] in our lives preeminence in the church
[59:57] if the word has preeminence then we can
[59:59] begin to see God move then we can begin
[1:00:02] to see Unity among the people then we
[1:00:04] can begin to see a power in the Church
[1:00:05] of God again and I want to see that I
[1:00:08] want that with all of my heart and I
[1:00:10] believe we see that but we want to
[1:00:11] continue we want to press further we
[1:00:13] want more than what we have now how we
[1:00:15] going to have it how we going to have it
[1:00:17] by putting the word back in preeminence
[1:00:19] again above my thoughts above my
[1:00:21] feelings above my hindrances above
[1:00:23] everything else yes
[1:00:26] amen I'm not amening myself as brother
[1:00:29] BR said but amen means so be it come on
[1:00:33] Hallelujah God never did bless Abraham
[1:00:35] until he separated himself he said and
[1:00:38] done what God told him to do you'll
[1:00:40] never receive the holy ghost in the
[1:00:42] fullness you'll never walk in the spirit
[1:00:44] of God until you totally separate
[1:00:46] yourself from your things from unbelief
[1:00:48] he said get away from the world come out
[1:00:50] of the world he said as soon as Abraham
[1:00:53] believed God by justification Believing
[1:00:54] on the Lord were Justified
[1:00:56] immediately God called Abraham to Total
[1:00:58] separation from all unbelief he said is
[1:01:00] that the way he did in you I I think we
[1:01:03] can all agree with that we may have been
[1:01:05] like Abraham and not immediately made a
[1:01:08] separation but he called us to
[1:01:10] it right it may have taken us some time
[1:01:13] it may you may still be working on that
[1:01:14] but he's called you to it he's called
[1:01:17] you to a total separation from unbelief
[1:01:20] he said is that the way he did in you
[1:01:22] separate yourself from your kindreds
[1:01:23] from all your Associates come out of the
[1:01:25] pool rooms come out of the danals come
[1:01:28] away from the things of the world God
[1:01:29] calls for a total separation to
[1:01:31] Abraham's seed because that's what he
[1:01:34] called Abraham and brother brandham uh
[1:01:37] illustrates that by using two
[1:01:38] instruments on the platform and saying
[1:01:41] one was Abraham and one was Abraham's
[1:01:43] seed and whatever works for Abraham
[1:01:44] works for Abraham's
[1:01:46] seed right now the Covenant was made to
[1:01:49] both Abraham and his seed after him and
[1:01:52] as Abraham was called by Grace by
[1:01:53] election so is his seed called oh my by
[1:01:57] grace and election they heard the voice
[1:02:00] of God now going back to last week you
[1:02:03] remember you got to hear it you got to
[1:02:05] have that experience you it's necessary
[1:02:09] that you hear from God you got to know
[1:02:12] that you heard from God yeah right but
[1:02:14] when you hear from God then you got to
[1:02:16] separate yourself from the things of the
[1:02:17] world he said Abraham was commanded uh
[1:02:21] to to to do that as Abraham was called
[1:02:22] by grace and election he said so is his
[1:02:25] seed called by grace in election they
[1:02:26] heard the voice of God and believed God
[1:02:28] and it was imputed unto him for
[1:02:30] righteousness he said you heard the
[1:02:32] voice of God in a barro everywhere it
[1:02:35] was at you believe God can do that
[1:02:37] absolutely he can do that he said and
[1:02:39] Abraham was commanded to abstain and to
[1:02:42] separate himself from the things of the
[1:02:44] world and so is the Seed of Abraham
[1:02:47] separate themselves from the seed of the
[1:02:50] things of the world right he said now as
[1:02:52] we find out Abraham never fully obeyed
[1:02:55] he said no that's the away with a lot of
[1:02:56] us people as soon as we go out and make
[1:02:58] a confession we think well now we've
[1:03:00] joined Church we're going to be pretty
[1:03:01] good people I I just need to preach this
[1:03:03] for a minute some of you young people
[1:03:05] you need to separate yourself yeah I
[1:03:07] don't mean separate yourself from the
[1:03:08] church that's the last thing you need to
[1:03:10] do I mean separate yourself from your
[1:03:13] ideas separate yourself from friends
[1:03:15] that are dragging you down separate
[1:03:17] yourself from unbelief that comes in
[1:03:19] tries to tell you that you're not going
[1:03:21] to make it separate yourself from those
[1:03:23] thoughts that tell you you're not worth
[1:03:24] anything and and there you're no good
[1:03:27] and and there's no power in your life
[1:03:28] you separate yourself from that let God
[1:03:31] move in your life let him do what he
[1:03:33] does separate yourself from worry
[1:03:36] constantly anxiety constantly in your
[1:03:38] life let it go cut it loose and let God
[1:03:41] begin to move and you begin to see
[1:03:42] something happen in your life some of us
[1:03:45] Elders need to separate ourselves from
[1:03:47] everything that's unlike the word oh we
[1:03:49] we we want bring this into it bring that
[1:03:51] into it let's believe the message of the
[1:03:53] hour let's believe the word that God

[1:04:16] smoke a lter won't if I just keep my
[1:04:17] card party that won't hurt anything but
[1:04:19] remember God never did bless Abraham
[1:04:21] until he fully obeyed and God will not
[1:04:24] bless his seed until you fully obey
[1:04:26] separating yourself from the things of
[1:04:27] the world if you're if you're messing
[1:04:29] around on the internet looking at things
[1:04:31] you shouldn't look at separate yourself
[1:04:33] from that that's why you sit under
[1:04:34] condemnation in the service separate
[1:04:36] yourself from those things let it
[1:04:39] go let it go you don't need it God's got
[1:04:43] a better plan for you he's got a better
[1:04:45] place for
[1:04:47] you
[1:04:50] good oh church I just feel his presence
[1:04:53] here this morning I want to separate
[1:04:55] from everything that's unlike unlike the
[1:04:58] Lord yes he said come out from among
[1:05:00] them be separate said Lord I will
[1:05:02] receive you touch not their unclean
[1:05:03] things you abide in me my word in you
[1:05:05] ask what you will and it'll be done to
[1:05:07] you in the Old Testament they had what
[1:05:10] they called a water of
[1:05:11] Separation It's Made From the Ashes of
[1:05:14] the red hepher and the red hepher is
[1:05:17] Christ that's a type of Christ and and
[1:05:20] so we could go into all of that but red
[1:05:23] is is a color of atonement it's a color
[1:05:26] of atonement and so the red hepher is
[1:05:28] Christ and brother brandom or Moses
[1:05:30] rather in the law in numbers 199 he says
[1:05:33] this a man that is clean Shall Gather up
[1:05:35] the ashes of the hepher and lay them up
[1:05:38] without the camp in a clean place so a
[1:05:41] man that is clean will lay them up in a
[1:05:43] clean place and it shall be kept for the
[1:05:45] congregation of the children of Israel
[1:05:47] for a water of Separation it's a
[1:05:49] purification for sin verse 13 it says
[1:05:53] whosoever toucheth the dead body of any
[1:05:55] man that is dead dead and purifieth not
[1:05:57] himself defileth the Tabernacle of the
[1:05:58] Lord and that Soul should be cut off
[1:06:00] from Israel because the water of
[1:06:02] Separation was not sprinkled upon him he
[1:06:04] should be unclean his uncleanness is yet
[1:06:06] upon him so now he had to there had to
[1:06:09] be a water of separation and if you went
[1:06:11] and touched a dead body you had to go
[1:06:13] get washed again now come on church we
[1:06:16] got to be washed and if you go out and
[1:06:19] touch and medle with the things of the
[1:06:20] world you need to come back and get
[1:06:21] washed again by the water of the word
[1:06:24] it's not just a one time thing but we're
[1:06:25] washed every time we hear the preaching
[1:06:27] of the word by the water of the
[1:06:30] word amen so he said the waters a
[1:06:33] separation is the word Paul said in
[1:06:35] Ephesians he has washed us with the
[1:06:37] water of the word see waterers a
[1:06:39] separation of the word preaching the
[1:06:40] word separates you don't you see why the
[1:06:43] devil hates that he wants to do away
[1:06:45] with that is preaching the word that
[1:06:48] separates you you hear the word and say
[1:06:51] I'm
[1:06:53] wrong I've done that many times Church
[1:06:56] many times you hear the word and you say
[1:06:58] I'm wrong I better quit this I'm playing
[1:07:02] church I better quit that he said see
[1:07:05] that's the Waters of
[1:07:07] Separation oh my just let yourself be
[1:07:10] washed by it he said it's the Waters of
[1:07:13] Separation Paul tells us in Ephesians
[1:07:16] 5:25 husbands love your wives even as
[1:07:19] Christ also loved the church and gave
[1:07:21] himself for it that he might sanctify
[1:07:25] and and cleanse it with what with the
[1:07:27] washing of water yes by the word by the
[1:07:31] word if you know something's wrong just
[1:07:32] let go of it and and when you hear the
[1:07:35] preaching of the word say Lord I'm wrong
[1:07:37] I Repent that's all it takes it doesn't
[1:07:39] take a big show just say Lord I'm wrong
[1:07:42] I'm sorry and he'll begin to move in
[1:07:43] your life again
[1:07:45] amen I'm so glad for that kind of Grace
[1:07:49] I'm so glad for that kind of love that
[1:07:50] kind of blood what good would Grace do
[1:07:53] me if it left me in my sin yeah what
[1:07:55] good would Grace do me if it left me
[1:07:56] like living like I always live what good
[1:07:59] would election do me if it just left me
[1:08:01] out in the world in the muck and the
[1:08:02] mire but it didn't leave me there it
[1:08:04] called me out into the presence of
[1:08:07] God
[1:08:09] hallelujah amen sorry for screaming at
[1:08:11] you this morning but it's just stirring
[1:08:14] my
[1:08:14] heart in Ephesians Paul said he said
[1:08:18] over there that God by the preaching of
[1:08:19] the word the Waters of Separation Faith
[1:08:21] cometh by hearing hearing by the word
[1:08:23] and the word of God is the Waters of
[1:08:25] separ separation for it's by renewing by
[1:08:27] the Water by the word hearing the word
[1:08:29] separates it he said now the unbeliever
[1:08:32] or the man in sin was outside he said
[1:08:35] here's a little part we don't want to
[1:08:36] pass that the water of Separation must
[1:08:38] be kept in a clean place and the
[1:08:40] preacher that preaches the gospel should
[1:08:42] be a clean upright man not a cigarette F
[1:08:45] fiend not a dope addict not a drunkard
[1:08:48] or a golf player on Sunday afternoon so
[1:08:50] forth like that no sir it must be kept
[1:08:52] in a clean Sanctified holy vessel one
[1:08:55] that holds the mystery of God in his
[1:08:57] heart other words he won't be doing
[1:08:59] these these things say well he didn't
[1:09:00] mention what I do but
[1:09:04] okay if your heart don't condemn you
[1:09:06] don't worry about it but if it
[1:09:09] does what he said the preacher that's
[1:09:11] where I stand this morning I got to hold
[1:09:13] the mystery of God in a clean Place hold
[1:09:16] the mystery of God in his heart must be
[1:09:18] in a clean church where they play Bingo
[1:09:20] in the basement Lottery have soup
[1:09:22] suppers what was the problem with soup
[1:09:24] suppers wasn't cuz they had had a
[1:09:25] potluck the problem with soup suppers
[1:09:27] was because they use it to pay the
[1:09:28] preacher instead of paying their tith
[1:09:31] right dances for the Young Folks preach
[1:09:34] the
[1:09:35] word amen preach that's what it we are
[1:09:39] no matter what happens Church no matter
[1:09:41] how we've got wonderful music we've got
[1:09:43] wonderful we' got wonderful programs
[1:09:45] we've got things we want to do with the
[1:09:46] children and and youth with the young
[1:09:48] people but the the thing we must do is
[1:09:51] preach the word the word must be
[1:09:53] declared across the pulpit we I've got
[1:09:55] an obligation to preach the word we've
[1:09:58] got to hold that high we've got to
[1:10:00] elevate that because that's the most
[1:10:02] important part of the service he said
[1:10:04] you don't have to have all this nonsense
[1:10:06] keep with the word and the word
[1:10:08] separates sinners from their sin yeah he
[1:10:11] said then every man out of Fellowship
[1:10:12] come up first through the waters of
[1:10:13] Separation at the congregation and he
[1:10:15] was sprinkled with these Waters now what
[1:10:17] was it the waters spoke of a dead
[1:10:19] sacrifice that went on before him the
[1:10:21] dead heer died in his place and when we
[1:10:24] preach the word
[1:10:25] it isn't on any denomination it's on
[1:10:28] Christ the sacrifice who died in your
[1:10:30] stead to sin Oh my he said you're out of
[1:10:33] Fellowship can't get prayer answered
[1:10:35] everything is black around you out of
[1:10:36] Fellowship come back to the word now yes
[1:10:40] he said the word goes to cutting
[1:10:41] separates you well you ought to do this
[1:10:43] you ought to do that this is here you
[1:10:45] don't have Fellowship no more you got
[1:10:47] yourself out of communion he said that's
[1:10:48] the Waters of Separation tells you what
[1:10:51] you should do right oh my we are
[1:10:54] separated from unbelief Washed by the
[1:10:56] Water of the word why do we have to be
[1:10:58] separated now think about it church we
[1:11:01] had to be separated for a
[1:11:06] union you know where I'm going right
[1:11:08] yeah all right we had to be separated
[1:11:10] for a spiritual union look at Romans
[1:11:13] chapter 7 Romans chapter 7 ver1 know you
[1:11:17] not brethren for I speak to them that
[1:11:19] know the law howth the law at dominion
[1:11:21] over a man as long as he liveth for the
[1:11:23] woman which has an husband is bound by
[1:11:25] the law to her husband so long as he
[1:11:27] liveth but if the husband be dead she's
[1:11:29] loose from the law of her husband now
[1:11:32] look brother brandham took that
[1:11:33] spiritually he wasn't just looking at
[1:11:34] marriage and divorce he took it
[1:11:36] spiritually he said you had to be
[1:11:37] separated from your old
[1:11:39] husband right he had to
[1:11:42] die Hallelujah he had to Die the old
[1:11:46] man's got to die now you go read Romans
[1:11:47] chapter 7 I challenge you read Romans
[1:11:49] chapter 7 read Romans chapter 8 and when
[1:11:52] you get finally to Romans chapter 8 what
[1:11:54] what happens Romans chapter 88 vers1
[1:11:56] there is therefore
[1:11:58] now when after
[1:12:01] separation there is therefore now after
[1:12:04] the invisible Union
[1:12:06] hallelujah hallelujah oh I love this
[1:12:09] after the invisible Union has been made
[1:12:11] oh there's been a secret wedding that's
[1:12:13] went on do you believe that church we've
[1:12:15] been United with the word we're we're
[1:12:17] being united with him here so we can go
[1:12:18] to the wedding supper there there's been
[1:12:21] a secret wedding ceremony going on and
[1:12:23] we and we're we're coming the word and
[1:12:26] as we as we are Washed by the Water of
[1:12:28] the word as we are separated from our
[1:12:30] sin what what what's going on Church
[1:12:32] what's happening is that now
[1:12:34] condemnation is being removed from us
[1:12:37] yes that's that's what we used to do
[1:12:38] that's who we used to be but God don't
[1:12:40] even see it
[1:12:41] [Applause]
[1:12:43] anymore yes there's a separation it's
[1:12:46] not just well don't do this and don't do
[1:12:48] that it's not just sanctification but
[1:12:50] it's actual separation and it's the
[1:12:52] killing of the old man yeah so you and I
[1:12:55] can be free right and live in the
[1:12:57] message of the hour the light of the
[1:12:59] hour listen sir there is therefore now
[1:13:02] no condemnation of them who are in
[1:13:04] Christ Jesus who walked not after the
[1:13:05] flesh after the spirit he the bridegroom
[1:13:09] took away your shame you you've heard
[1:13:12] this read so many times but now think
[1:13:14] about it as along with Abraham
[1:13:16] separating from lot you've got to
[1:13:19] separate from
[1:13:21] unbelief right your old husband and then
[1:13:24] the bridegroom the only way you can do
[1:13:25] that is by the ashes of the red
[1:13:27] hepher right the Waters of Separation
[1:13:31] The Death his death on the cross and
[1:13:33] then when you accept that you believe
[1:13:35] that in this hour then he washes you by
[1:13:37] the water of the word he the bridegroom
[1:13:40] took away your shame put it in the sea
[1:13:42] of forgetfulness by the washing of the
[1:13:44] water of the word and the blood of life
[1:13:46] he said that's what the Bible said your
[1:13:48] first husband that you were married to
[1:13:50] the world yeah right so you were married
[1:13:53] to the world the anointed bridegroom
[1:13:55] which for ordained you has washed you by
[1:13:58] the washing of the Water by the church
[1:14:03] no that doesn't sound right does
[1:14:06] it you're not washed by the church right
[1:14:10] cuz the church might not be completely
[1:14:12] clean right come on church not everybody
[1:14:16] you go to church with is going to be a
[1:14:18] believer and that's just the way it is
[1:14:20] but we love him anyway we right brother
[1:14:23] in every congregation there was three
[1:14:24] kinds of Believers but we don't kick
[1:14:25] them out let God let God do what God
[1:14:28] does because the truth is I'm a poor
[1:14:31] judge of who is and who isn't right
[1:14:33] right so we we just let we we let it go
[1:14:36] but but yet we we realize we must keep
[1:14:38] sin out of the church we got to do those
[1:14:39] things but we rely on the Holy Ghost to
[1:14:42] do those things as much as we can now
[1:14:45] now look you're and I believe the Holy
[1:14:47] Ghost is always right but now our first
[1:14:51] husband was the world and we are not
[1:14:53] washed by the church from the world so
[1:14:56] it's not that we reform people into
[1:14:58] believing the gospel you got to be
[1:15:00] washed by the
[1:15:02] word right not by the church now look he
[1:15:06] said that doesn't sound right no no you
[1:15:07] might find that in the almanac but not
[1:15:09] in God's Bible by the washing of the
[1:15:10] Water by the word you are
[1:15:18] standing oh church I feel like preaching
[1:15:20] this is almost like it's almost like
[1:15:22] singing Standing on the Promises and
[1:15:25] everybody sitting down you can't hardly
[1:15:26] do that can you but you're standing he
[1:15:29] not talking about where you're literally

[1:15:32] positioning Christ you are standing all
[1:15:36] right Hallelujah sir that ought to give
[1:15:40] us such Faith like

[1:16:14] Hallelujah sir how we can forgive
[1:16:18] people that's why we don't hold things
[1:16:20] against people because we know what we
[1:16:22] were yeah and what we came from and what
[1:16:25] God forgave us of and what God changed
[1:16:27] us from that's why we can let it go
[1:16:29] that's why we can we can we can love our
[1:16:31] enemies why because we know we were not
[1:16:34] standing in that place but he brought us
[1:16:36] into that place and we had nothing to do
[1:16:38] with it right he come in and he and he
[1:16:41] caused his word to be preached and it
[1:16:42] separated us from the things of the

[1:19:23] born of the spirit of God God washed in
[1:19:25] the blood of Jesus Christ Oh Glory to
[1:19:28] God believes every word of God stands as
[1:19:30] though you never sined at the first
[1:19:32] place you are perfect thank you
[1:19:39] Lord come on Church why we let that
[1:19:41] devil beat up on us
[1:19:43] for God called
[1:19:45] you God elected you God separated you
[1:19:50] and if you're not separated but see
[1:19:52] that's the reason we have condemnation
[1:19:54] because of lack of Separation right but
[1:19:56] if we'll just let the word not anything
[1:19:59] we do just let the word do it let it
[1:20:01] separate us from the world and when we
[1:20:05] let it separate us from the world there
[1:20:07] is therefore now no condemnation right
[1:20:10] now
[1:20:11] look you are perfect oh my yeah I have
[1:20:16] never stood and brother Caleb and looked
[1:20:19] in the mirror in the
[1:20:22] morning while getting ready and looked
[1:20:24] at myself and said you are
[1:20:29] perfect you ever done that brother
[1:20:31] Harold problem may be the hair you
[1:20:35] know maybe he did his hair and just
[1:20:37] right you are
[1:20:40] perfect but I've never I've never even
[1:20:43] never even crossed my
[1:20:45] mind right because it's just so
[1:20:50] apparent so evident
[1:20:54] but
[1:20:56] Abraham right he believed he called
[1:20:59] those things which were and so they were
[1:21:01] not those things which were not as
[1:21:03] though they
[1:21:04] were and so you could today by the
[1:21:07] authority of the word of God you could
[1:21:10] stand and look in the mirror and say you
[1:21:12] are perfect why can you do that by the
[1:21:14] blood of Jesus
[1:21:16] Christ let anybody say what they want to
[1:21:19] say let people talk how they want to
[1:21:21] talk you are perfect in the eyes of
[1:21:23] Jesus Christ
[1:21:26] glory to
[1:21:29] God brother Bren said if I was supposed
[1:21:31] to die in the morning and a man took my
[1:21:33] place I cannot die for that sin yeah
[1:21:36] somebody took my place right and Jesus
[1:21:39] the word took my place he became me that
[1:21:42] a sinner that I might become him the
[1:21:44] word he said let me hold true to it not
[1:21:46] the church the word yes said oh that
[1:21:50] spiritual union of Christ and his church
[1:21:52] now when the flesh is becoming wor and
[1:21:54] the word is becoming flesh manifested
[1:21:57] Vindicated yes oh I love this yeah he
[1:22:00] said just what the Bible said would
[1:22:02] happen in this day it's happening day by
[1:22:04] day now look how he ties this washing of
[1:22:07] the water of the word sometimes we read
[1:22:09] portions of this but I'm reading several
[1:22:11] paragraphs to you out of this message
[1:22:13] invisible Union because I want you to
[1:22:15] understand what he's saying he's saying
[1:22:16] that by the word that was coming forth
[1:22:18] in his own Ministry then that we were
[1:22:20] being Washed by the word that was oh God
[1:22:23] that was coming forth we were being
[1:22:25] washed by that because it was not
[1:22:27] something different from the Bible it
[1:22:28] was light on the Bible and when it come
[1:22:31] to us when that opening of the word came
[1:22:33] it actually opened Christ to us it
[1:22:36] opened Grace to us it opened Revelation
[1:22:38] to us of who he was and who we are so
[1:22:42] brother brand said just what the Bible
[1:22:44] said would happen it's happening day by
[1:22:45] day why it's accumulating so fast out
[1:22:48] there in those deserts things taking
[1:22:50] place my he I couldn't even keep up with
[1:22:52] it we're near the coming of Jesus to be
[1:22:55] United with his church where the word
[1:22:57] becomes the word he said the call of the
[1:22:59] Holy Spirit searching the hearts you're
[1:23:01] standing completely you never sinned at
[1:23:04] the first
[1:23:06] place
[1:23:08] Hallelujah God don't even know
[1:23:11] nothing you don't know it yeah that is
[1:23:16] the most incomprehensible thing about
[1:23:20] God I challenge you to find something
[1:23:23] something that is harder to
[1:23:26] understand than the fact that a God who
[1:23:28] knows everything that ever
[1:23:32] happened right now he ain't like me I
[1:23:35] may look at you today and forget your
[1:23:36] name
[1:23:37] tomorrow he don't do
[1:23:40] that I forgot my wife's name one
[1:23:44] time and we'd been married for 16 years

[1:23:49] time and a brother asked to be
[1:23:51] introduced to her Minister brother he

[1:24:16] me see it'd be easy it would be easy to
[1:24:19] believe that I forgot your sins I forget
[1:24:22] everything but he don't forget nothing
[1:24:26] right
[1:24:27] nothing he knows every detail of every
[1:24:30] thought of every you realize that
[1:24:34] church we try to hide from God and we
[1:24:36] try to we try to sit there and think

[1:24:40] God don't know he

[1:31:50] be washed from the filth of these
[1:31:51] prostitutes and be cleaned and
[1:31:53] sanctified but the washing of the water
[1:31:55] of the word makes your mind and heart
[1:31:57] stay on God and on his word oh do you
[1:32:00] believe that this morning yes yes
[1:32:03] Abraham and lot had to
[1:32:05] separate they had to separate because of
[1:32:07] strife not so much between them as
[1:32:10] between their herdsmen Genesis 13:5 lot
[1:32:13] also which went with Abram had flocks
[1:32:14] and herds and
[1:32:16] Tents the land was not able to Bear them
[1:32:18] that they might dwell together for their
[1:32:20] substance was great so that they could
[1:32:22] not dwell together there was a Strife
[1:32:24] between the Herdman of Abram's cattle
[1:32:26] and the Herdman of Lot's cattle and the
[1:32:28] Canaanite and the perizzite dwelling
[1:32:29] then in the land and what did you have
[1:32:31] you had two competing interests for the
[1:32:34] same
[1:32:36] resources right Lots herdsman's out here
[1:32:39] fighting with Abram's herdsman listen to
[1:32:42] me many times white people struggle in
[1:32:45] fully obeying God they have two
[1:32:46] competing interests in their life all
[1:32:48] right and one hasn't taken dominion over
[1:32:51] the other and because they're together
[1:32:53] they're not separate unbelief and Faith
[1:32:55] they actually both war in the mind and
[1:32:58] they get equal
[1:32:59] ground come on you give them equal time
[1:33:02] yeah and unbelief and Faith compete and
[1:33:05] there's Strife between unbelief and
[1:33:07] Faith right and what has to happen there
[1:33:10] has to come a
[1:33:12] separation Amen Let lot go his way let
[1:33:16] the unbelief go its way so your faith
[1:33:19] has room to grow and Abram said to lot
[1:33:22] let there be no Strife I pray between me
[1:33:24] and thee between my Herdman and thy
[1:33:26] Herdman for we be Brethren he said is
[1:33:28] not the whole land before thee separate
[1:33:30] thyself I pray thee from me if thou will
[1:33:32] take the left hand I will go to the
[1:33:34] right if thou depart to the that's yeah
[1:33:37] that is right if thou depart to the
[1:33:39] right hand then I will go to the
[1:33:43] left but Abraham the man of God sir
[1:33:46] brother said gave lot his choice and
[1:33:47] took what was left oh I just love that a
[1:33:50] real believer will give you your choice
[1:33:52] he's willing to take what left there's
[1:33:54] no selfishness in a real believer not at
[1:33:58] all and lot looked around right the this
[1:34:02] what the flesh always wants by the
[1:34:04] way and beheld the plain of
[1:34:07] Jordan was well watered everywhere
[1:34:10] before the Lord destroyed Sodom and
[1:34:12] Gomorrah even as the garden of the Lord
[1:34:13] like the land of Egypt as th comest un
[1:34:16] zor wasn't the part of Egypt we
[1:34:20] visited verse 11 then lot shows him all
[1:34:23] the plain of Jordan Lot journeyed East
[1:34:26] and they separated themselves one from
[1:34:30] the other brother BR said lot like so
[1:34:33] many today seen the
[1:34:35] opportunity if he ever got away from
[1:34:37] that strictness why he might make
[1:34:40] himself a few
[1:34:42] dollars
[1:34:45] oh he said he might be a popular man so
[1:34:48] he looked down towards Sodom and it was
[1:34:51] a well-watered land a big city fine
[1:34:53] industry Sal and so forth you know what
[1:34:55] I don't know how the world's even
[1:34:56] appealing to people today did anybody
[1:34:58] watch the
[1:35:01] debate that's the leadership of the
[1:35:03] world brother Allan admitted it that was
[1:35:05] the leadership of the
[1:35:09] world I was like good grief what has
[1:35:12] happened to
[1:35:14] us but yet the world is still a pull
[1:35:17] because people look and see the well
[1:35:18] watered plane this it'd be so much
[1:35:20] easier if we were away from this
[1:35:22] strictness of the message
[1:35:26] way they feel and so they look at that
[1:35:28] well watered plane said they had to
[1:35:29] export from there and again it was full
[1:35:31] of Big Time women with all their Jezebel
[1:35:33] paint and everything just a great time
[1:35:35] his wife kind of felt a little that way
[1:35:36] too because he we find out after he
[1:35:38] become mayor down there she kind of like
[1:35:40] the way of the people that's the only
[1:35:42] thing you have to do is get mixed up
[1:35:44] with
[1:35:47] something God wants you to separate
[1:35:49] yourself get so far away from them
[1:35:51] things that you don't even see them at
[1:35:53] all all right if there's a spirit that's
[1:35:55] bothering you something that's causing
[1:35:56] you to act differently than you've acted
[1:35:59] before and act in ways that are against
[1:36:00] the word maybe that you're hanging out
[1:36:02] around the wrong
[1:36:04] people
[1:36:06] right and that's easy to
[1:36:09] fix for most of
[1:36:11] us God wants you to separate yourself
[1:36:13] get so far away from them till than them
[1:36:16] things so you don't even see them at all
[1:36:18] that you want to see one thing how many
[1:36:19] want to see one thing this morning one
[1:36:22] thing that's him what he promised yes
[1:36:26] Genesis 13:12 Abram dwelt in the land of
[1:36:28] Cana and lot dwelt in the cities of the
[1:36:29] plain and pitched his tent toward Sodom
[1:36:32] but the men of Sodom were Wicked and
[1:36:34] sinners before the Lord
[1:36:36] exceedingly brother brand said Abraham
[1:36:38] was a separated person from the world
[1:36:40] when God called Abraham at 75 years old
[1:36:42] separate yourself from your Kindred from
[1:36:44] all the unbelief come out into a world
[1:36:45] that you've never walked in before
[1:36:47] amongst some people you've never known
[1:36:49] before come out and separate yourself
[1:36:51] from anybody that would be contrary to
[1:36:52] what you're believing then would be a
[1:36:53] Nazarite to the Lord because he was
[1:36:55] holding a promise of his son he had to
[1:36:57] separate from his father his mother his
[1:36:59] Kindred what separated him not because
[1:37:01] he was a good man Church what separated
[1:37:05] him not because he was a good man but
[1:37:07] because he believed that God was able to
[1:37:10] keep the promise he'd give him why do we
[1:37:12] follow the message of the hour why do we
[1:37:14] live like we live brother Stewart not
[1:37:16] because we're better men but because we
[1:37:19] believe we believe in the promise God's
[1:37:22] given us we believe we're going to a
[1:37:24] rapture we believe so it's not a hard
[1:37:26] thing for us to live and act like
[1:37:27] Christians because we
[1:37:30] believe
[1:37:31] hallelujah hallelujah how many Believers
[1:37:34] we got here this morning oh I just love
[1:37:37] it we should we should just be sitting
[1:37:39] in Heavenly places with so many
[1:37:41] Believers I believe that you are listen
[1:37:44] only after unbelief was separated from
[1:37:47] him and he had fully obeyed God could
[1:37:49] Abraham then become a possessor of all
[1:37:52] things yeah Genesis 13:14 the Lord said
[1:37:55] to Abram after that lot was separated
[1:37:57] from him brother Bram emphasizes the
[1:37:59] after he said lift up now thine eyes
[1:38:02] look from the place where thou art
[1:38:03] northward and Southward Eastward
[1:38:04] Westward for all the land which thou
[1:38:06] seeth to thee will I give it and to thy
[1:38:08] seed forever if Abraham listen if
[1:38:11] Abraham had been in the valley with
[1:38:14] lot if he had went with him or if he'
[1:38:17] made that
[1:38:18] choice he would not have been able to
[1:38:21] see
[1:38:24] it might be harder to live up on the
[1:38:26] mountain but at least you can
[1:38:30] see Church lot is blind in the valley he
[1:38:35] can't see beyond the walls of his
[1:38:37] denomination he can't see beyond the
[1:38:39] walls of Sodom he can't see cuz he's in
[1:38:41] the valley but Abram's on the
[1:38:44] mountain Glory he's up up on if you see
[1:38:47] if you know the Topography of that land
[1:38:49] and how it's a great valley it's it's
[1:38:51] it's hundreds of miles it's great valley
[1:38:53] that goes down and here at the land of
[1:38:55] Israel's M mountainous and here it goes
[1:38:57] down on that side where modern day
[1:38:58] Jordan is goes down into the valley and
[1:39:01] lot chose the valley but Abraham if he
[1:39:03] had been in that Valley he could have
[1:39:05] never helped lot get out of
[1:39:07] it are you with me now he could have
[1:39:10] never helped him but because he was on
[1:39:11] the mountain he could see he said
[1:39:14] whatever you see that wouldn't have been
[1:39:15] much if he' had been in
[1:39:17] Sodom but what whatever you see you can
[1:39:20] have that's yours now look
[1:39:24] he had been Washed by the Water of the
[1:39:25] word now he could walk through his
[1:39:29] possession right we're going to finish
[1:39:31] this tonight I just it just means so
[1:39:33] much to me but I'll just say this
[1:39:35] Abraham said could possess that land
[1:39:38] because what was on it God gave it to
[1:39:41] him right oh and now we're getting it's
[1:39:43] getting good yeah it probably hard on
[1:39:45] Abraham to see lock
[1:39:47] go so his nephew and not just his nephew
[1:39:50] he'd helped raise him it was like his
[1:39:52] son
[1:39:54] and Abraham didn't have any children he
[1:39:56] had to separate from anything
[1:40:01] that he had to separate from anything
[1:40:04] that would approximate or try to
[1:40:06] distract him from the
[1:40:09] promise right if he put maybe all of his
[1:40:11] future in lot God said you got to
[1:40:14] separate from
[1:40:16] him but when he was on the mountain and
[1:40:20] he looked all around yeah he could see
[1:40:24] then right that's when you that's when
[1:40:26] you can help somebody when you're
[1:40:27] standing on the mountain of Grace when
[1:40:30] you're walking in the message of the
[1:40:31] hour and the light of the hour then he
[1:40:34] could see and he said he all that was in
[1:40:37] the land God give it to him and lot was
[1:40:40] a part of that land yes sir so Abraham
[1:40:45] had a right to
[1:40:46] it the only way he could really help lot
[1:40:50] is by separating from unbelief but now
[1:40:53] Abraham possessed all things even what
[1:40:59] yes all right
[1:41:03] Hallelujah as we close if the musicians
[1:41:05] would come this
[1:41:07] morning you cannot possess all things
[1:41:11] until you've been separated from
[1:41:12] unbelief by the washing of the Water by
[1:41:15] the
[1:41:16] word the Bible says the word of God is
[1:41:18] quick and Powerful means it's alive it's
[1:41:22] powerful it's sharper
[1:41:23] and any two-edged sword piercing even to
[1:41:26] the dividing of Thunder of Soul and
[1:41:29] Spirit separating the joints and the
[1:41:32] marrow and is a discerner of the
[1:41:36] thoughts and
[1:41:37] intents of the
[1:41:40] heart Abraham had to say Lord I believe
[1:41:43] what you told me I believe what you told
[1:41:46] me if it calls me to separation so be it
[1:41:48] Lord yes let me fully obey you yes let
[1:41:52] me be separated I'm not saying of people
[1:41:54] today so much as as being separated from
[1:41:57] thoughts that would exalt themselves
[1:41:59] against the mind of Christ let me be
[1:42:01] separated from every thought let me be
[1:42:03] separated from every deed let me be
[1:42:05] separated from every word that is not
[1:42:07] your
[1:42:08] word let me be separated from every
[1:42:11] thought that would exalt itself against
[1:42:12] the knowledge of
[1:42:14] Christ let me be a possessor of all
[1:42:18] things even my backsliding nephew are
[1:42:22] you with me now let me be a possessor of
[1:42:24] all things let me be a help to my
[1:42:27] community how can I do that by being a
[1:42:29] real Believer by standing on the
[1:42:31] mountain being able to see and you can
[1:42:34] be a help to the pennies be a help to
[1:42:36] the to the half dollars be a help to the
[1:42:39] silver dollars would you bow your head
