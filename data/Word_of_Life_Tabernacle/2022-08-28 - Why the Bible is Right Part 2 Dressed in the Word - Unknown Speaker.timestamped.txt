[50:30] revelation chapter 19 and verse six

[50:36] how the bible is right why the bible is
[50:39] right and the foundation of our faith
[50:42] and kind of go then a little bit
[50:43] different direction this morning
[50:45] we'll just see what the lord does i
[50:47] won't hold you long i'm going to try to
[50:48] stop about about noon so you'll have
[50:51] time to go out and eat and then our
[50:52] dinner today will be after
[50:54] uh after the service tonight amen
[50:57] revelation 19 6
[51:00] it says and i heard as it were the voice
[51:02] of a great multitude
[51:04] and as the voice of many waters as the
[51:06] voice of mighty thunderings
[51:08] saying alleluia for the lord god
[51:10] omnipotent
[51:12] reigneth
[51:13] let us be glad and rejoice that's the
[51:17] hour that we live in church
[51:19] let us be glad and rejoice and give
[51:21] honor
[51:22] to him
[51:23] for the marriage of the lamb
[51:26] is come
[51:27] and his wife hath made herself
[51:30] ready
[51:32] and to her was granted that she should
[51:34] be arrayed in fine linen
[51:36] clean and white
[51:38] for the fine linen as the righteousness
[51:41] of saints i pray the lord would add his
[51:42] blessing to the word
[51:44] let's bow our heads together for just a
[51:46] moment if you have some special need
[51:48] maybe
[51:49] on your heart and in your mind would you
[51:51] raise your hand to the lord god bless
[51:52] those hands heavenly father we're so
[51:54] thankful to be in your presence the art
[51:57] as we've done these things and we've
[51:59] talked to the sunday school we've heard
[52:00] the singing lord in our children how it
[52:03] thrilled our hearts to see them lord
[52:05] asking questions and then singing lord
[52:08] we've dedicated the baby lord and now
[52:10] today we turn our attention to your word
[52:13] lord we know these things have been done
[52:15] in your name but lord now would you just
[52:17] allow your presence to settle down among
[52:20] us lord as your word is preached i pray
[52:22] that you to hold me lord keep me from
[52:24] saying anything that's against your word
[52:27] lord and that i would only say those
[52:29] things that you'd have me to say lord i
[52:31] pray for these needs that were
[52:32] represented by way of uplifted hand i
[52:34] pray you'd meet every one of those needs
[52:36] today that you to help them lord in all
[52:38] of their life we pray and we ask it in
[52:40] jesus name amen man god bless you you
[52:44] can be seated
[52:47] the bible is right
[52:50] we believe that today
[52:52] the bible is right
[52:54] that is the foundation of our faith we
[52:56] do not have a faith that is not grounded
[52:59] or settled but the bible is right
[53:02] you might be in the worst trouble of
[53:04] your life you might be in a situation
[53:07] where it's hard and and it's difficult
[53:09] and there's struggles all around you you
[53:11] might be like we preached about jonah in
[53:13] the belly of the fish but yet you can
[53:15] say this morning the bible is right and
[53:18] because the word is right because jonah
[53:20] believed that what's what solomon said
[53:23] when he prayed there in the temple that
[53:24] was written in the scripture and he
[53:26] believed that and when he believed that
[53:28] it was effective in his life and when we
[53:31] believe it it is effective in our life
[53:33] we must have a foundation for our faith
[53:36] without a foundation everything is
[53:38] negotiable and when you begin to
[53:40] negotiate with the devil you get in
[53:42] trouble
[53:43] when you begin to bargain with the devil
[53:45] like eve did and he said surely you
[53:48] won't die and she began to bargain with
[53:50] him surely it don't mean what it says so
[53:52] when she began to bargain with him over
[53:54] the clear revelation of the word what
[53:56] happened is she ended up in death and
[53:58] despair and everything like that but
[54:01] when jesus come he was the word and the
[54:04] antidote to the argument over the word
[54:06] was the reality of the word walking in
[54:08] shoe leather and i'm so glad we had a
[54:10] god who didn't just give us a theory he
[54:13] didn't just give us an identification
[54:15] and say well that's the word he wasn't
[54:17] just a theologian but he was god in
[54:19] flesh
[54:21] and that's what we want to be today we
[54:23] want to be the holiest we want to be god
[54:25] in this hour that part of god in flesh
[54:27] living in our generation
[54:30] amen now
[54:32] little messiah is walking along little
[54:34] little word
[54:35] if we could say it that way walking
[54:37] around
[54:38] the world that we live in
[54:40] as the children said today and they said
[54:43] well we talk to kids at school and they
[54:45] don't believe
[54:46] they don't believe we try to tell them
[54:48] but they don't believe i said you just
[54:49] live it
[54:50] and live such a life that that they will
[54:53] believe and
[54:54] and and some may never but if there's a
[54:57] predestined seed out there somewhere
[54:58] they'll they'll grab a hold of that
[55:01] it'll be a light to them maybe they
[55:02] won't ever read the word but they'll see
[55:04] your life
[55:06] our faith has its foundation on the
[55:08] inerrancy of the word of god
[55:12] that's everything
[55:13] and brother branham taught us that that
[55:15] gives it a perfect resting place
[55:18] amen aren't you glad that you have a
[55:21] perfect resting place today
[55:23] and that perfect resting place is not
[55:25] how i feel it's not my emotion it's not
[55:27] my it's not anything else but it's the
[55:30] perfect resting place is the word of god
[55:33] so we find it in the scripture that
[55:35] abraham journeyed and just to kind of
[55:37] background this for a little bit before
[55:39] we move on abraham journeyed and he
[55:41] looked for a city with foundations the
[55:44] bible said he looketh for a city which
[55:46] has foundations in other words a city
[55:48] that's stable a city that that is set on
[55:51] something
[55:52] and we find in the early church when
[55:55] they came that they were built
[55:57] on the same foundation ephesians 2 19
[56:00] says you are no more strangers and and
[56:02] foreigners you're not wandering around
[56:04] looking for something with a foundation
[56:06] but your fellow citizens with the saints
[56:08] and of the household of god and are
[56:10] built upon the foundation
[56:13] of the apostles and prophets jesus
[56:16] christ himself
[56:18] being the chief cornerstone
[56:21] so now he said this is the church's
[56:23] foundation he said well the church is
[56:25] built on the rock of revelation that's
[56:27] true what is the revelation of it's a
[56:30] revelation of jesus christ who he is who
[56:33] is he he's the word
[56:35] amen a revelation of the word is
[56:37] everything to us
[56:39] you can't overstate the importance of
[56:41] the revelation of the word of god
[56:44] so now
[56:46] as we realized then as we go through the
[56:48] church ages each one was identified with
[56:50] the foundation when you come in
[56:52] revelation 3 and 12 to the laodicean
[56:55] church ages he said him that overcometh
[56:57] i make a pillar in the temple of my god
[57:00] and he shall go no more out this is the
[57:01] philadelphian church age he shall go no
[57:03] more out and i will write upon him the
[57:05] name of my god and the name of the city
[57:07] of my god which is new jerusalem which
[57:09] cometh down out of heaven from my god i
[57:11] will write upon him my new name notice
[57:13] what he says i will make him a pillar in
[57:15] the temple of my god
[57:17] but branham said in other words part of
[57:18] the foundation
[57:20] i'm going to make him a pillar you ever
[57:22] heard the saying he was a pillar of the
[57:24] church
[57:26] what does that mean part of the
[57:27] foundation
[57:28] part of what makes it stand
[57:30] and he said he that overcometh i'll make
[57:32] him part of the foundation
[57:35] what will i give him i'll put in him the
[57:37] doctrine of the apostles and prophets
[57:39] from the beginning give him the
[57:41] revelation what the prophets say about
[57:43] him he's counsellor prince of peace
[57:45] mighty god everlasting father and
[57:47] everyone who's a part of that foundation
[57:49] says the same thing what do we look at
[57:51] last week how that every book in the
[57:53] bible we could look at the old testament
[57:54] and see in every book who he was how he
[57:57] was the will in the middle of the wheel
[57:58] and all of those things that we saw in
[58:00] each one of those books what was it what
[58:02] was that we can look and we agree with
[58:04] the prophets we we have a revelation the
[58:07] same revelation that they did and we
[58:08] become a part of that same foundation
[58:12] what they said about him we say about
[58:14] him
[58:15] counselor prince of peace mighty god
[58:18] everlasting father healer deliverer
[58:21] are you with me now
[58:23] that makes you part of the foundation
[58:26] oh i
[58:27] this is good this morning i'm not saying
[58:29] that because i'm preaching i'm saying
[58:30] that because it's the word
[58:32] hey man i'm saying that because i get to
[58:34] fellowship with you good people and feel
[58:36] the presence of god and the joy of the
[58:38] lord being our strength today even in
[58:40] times of sorrow
[58:42] amen well he said what will i give him
[58:45] i'll put him in the doctrine of the
[58:47] apostles and prophets
[58:49] he said that's what they said the
[58:50] prophets and the apostles and he that
[58:52] can overcome all this synagogue of satan
[58:54] keep himself free and look straight to
[58:56] the gate i'll make him a pillar i'll put
[58:58] him back in the foundation of my word in
[59:01] the house of my god
[59:02] he said i'll put him right there in that
[59:04] pillar in the foundation where you stay
[59:07] right in the word
[59:09] oh my you don't move something that's
[59:10] been put in the foundation
[59:12] our future home has the same foundation
[59:14] revelation 21 and 14 it says the wall of
[59:17] the city had twelve foundations
[59:20] in them the names of the twelve apostles
[59:22] of the lamb we could contrast that with
[59:24] the beast in revelation 17 which ascends
[59:27] out of a bottomless pit
[59:30] a pit with no foundation notice
[59:32] revelation 17 8 he was ascend out of the
[59:35] bottomless pit and go into perdition
[59:38] what is it what is the bottomless pit
[59:40] it's there's no foundation for catholic
[59:43] doctrine remember
[59:44] that that catholic church that beast
[59:46] rose up out of the bottomless pit he
[59:48] said there's no foundation for catholic
[59:50] doctrine there's no bible
[59:53] for catholic doctrine
[59:55] listen any doctrine that does not come
[59:58] from this bible
[1:00:00] come out of the bottomless pit
[1:00:03] right
[1:00:04] that's where it come from is the bottom
[1:00:06] there's no foundation
[1:00:07] but we've found a city
[1:00:09] we've found a christ who has a
[1:00:12] foundation he said in the volume of the
[1:00:14] book it's written to me
[1:00:16] amen it's something with a foundation we
[1:00:18] are not a cult we are not some kind we
[1:00:21] are christians today we are believers in
[1:00:23] the bible we believe that god does what
[1:00:26] he said he would do we believe he's the
[1:00:28] same yesterday today and forever we
[1:00:30] stand firm on the foundation of the
[1:00:32] scripture yes sir
[1:00:34] hallelujah
[1:00:35] amen there's no bible for any of that
[1:00:37] but there is
[1:00:39] a scripture
[1:00:40] for for what we believe and there are
[1:00:43] it's the entirety of the word of god we
[1:00:46] find that he was the word and then his
[1:00:48] wife
[1:00:49] the wife that was described in our in
[1:00:51] our text in revelation 19 she's
[1:00:54] different from others
[1:00:55] because she's a bride of the word
[1:00:58] she's going to a city
[1:01:00] with foundations
[1:01:02] notice
[1:01:03] where she is going
[1:01:05] what she is wearing
[1:01:06] and how she wears it
[1:01:08] in revelation 19 of 7 he said let us be
[1:01:11] glad and rejoice and give honor to him
[1:01:13] for the marriage of the lamb
[1:01:16] is come and his wife hath made herself
[1:01:19] ready
[1:01:20] i want you to watch closely now and put
[1:01:22] your thinking caps on and as we go
[1:01:24] through this it may be just a little
[1:01:26] different maybe than what you've heard
[1:01:28] but i believe it's the scripture and the
[1:01:30] message of the hour now
[1:01:32] the word is come
[1:01:34] it could be translated has been
[1:01:36] completed the marriage of the lamb
[1:01:40] has been completed
[1:01:42] it is completed
[1:01:44] and as i begin to think about that i
[1:01:47] begin to think you know what is she
[1:01:49] getting ready to go to
[1:01:52] now when we think about this scripture i
[1:01:54] know as a child i would look at this
[1:01:56] scripture and i would think well there
[1:01:57] is an application of it to that i would
[1:01:59] think well you know
[1:02:01] the bride she's getting ready
[1:02:04] and so she wants to dress correctly so
[1:02:06] she shows up at the wedding in a proper
[1:02:09] dress so the groom will accept her
[1:02:13] now and if you think that way that's
[1:02:15] that's kind of how i thought about it
[1:02:17] but think about it
[1:02:19] not you know
[1:02:22] i loved my wife's dress but i didn't
[1:02:24] care that much about it
[1:02:25] maybe i shouldn't admit that after 16
[1:02:27] years
[1:02:30] but she she wore a white dress and we
[1:02:33] still have it it's yellow now i think
[1:02:35] but
[1:02:35] it's it's still there and
[1:02:37] and in in a box in our in our storage
[1:02:42] and you know
[1:02:44] and i
[1:02:45] i won't go there but
[1:02:47] it's not usable anymore and
[1:02:50] in any way and
[1:02:52] so it's just sitting there and so now uh
[1:02:55] you know but i didn't care so much about
[1:02:56] that but danny she did she wanted a
[1:02:58] beautiful dress
[1:03:00] now why did she want a beautiful dress
[1:03:03] she wanted to present herself to me in a
[1:03:05] certain way
[1:03:07] she cared about it
[1:03:10] oh god
[1:03:11] she cared about she wasn't going to gain
[1:03:13] my favor
[1:03:16] based on the dress that she wore
[1:03:19] because she'd already gained my favor
[1:03:23] now notice what it said go back to that
[1:03:25] scripture the marriage of the lamb has
[1:03:27] come
[1:03:29] the bride is now the wife and the
[1:03:31] marriage supper is about to be served
[1:03:33] now he said the marriage of the lamb has
[1:03:35] come
[1:03:36] his wife has made herself ready
[1:03:39] what wants to say his wife
[1:03:42] right he doesn't say his is engaged
[1:03:44] right has betrothed his wife
[1:03:48] amen the bride is now the wife
[1:03:51] are you with me this morning
[1:03:53] and if you begin to think deeply about
[1:03:55] that you begin to realize that it's not
[1:03:58] me getting ready and dressing myself in
[1:04:01] the word so i can then go and maybe i'll
[1:04:04] be maybe he'll accept me
[1:04:07] but see this wedding started a long time
[1:04:09] ago
[1:04:10] come on
[1:04:11] amen he this ceremony has been going on
[1:04:14] a long time
[1:04:15] because he slipped his wedding band to
[1:04:17] predestine unmerited grace on me before
[1:04:20] the foundation of the earth
[1:04:23] come on are you with me now and in this
[1:04:26] age the marriage that was was was
[1:04:29] finally come together we're now his wife
[1:04:32] and we'll talk about that in a moment
[1:04:34] but but now think about what that does
[1:04:37] because it's not me going out here and
[1:04:39] attempting
[1:04:40] to please him enough
[1:04:43] to get in his favor to gain his favor
[1:04:47] right that's not what i'm here for
[1:04:50] not to please him enough so that and
[1:04:52] many times we think that way we think
[1:04:53] legalistically
[1:04:55] we think well i'm going to do all the
[1:04:57] right things and i'm going to gain the
[1:04:58] favor no you don't gain his favor
[1:05:01] by dressing in the word but you dress in
[1:05:04] the word because you've gained his favor
[1:05:08] he already put the wedding band on you
[1:05:13] are you with me this morning
[1:05:15] where is she going
[1:05:17] she's going to the marriage supper
[1:05:20] amen how do we know that verse 9 he
[1:05:22] saith unto me right blessed are they
[1:05:24] which are called unto the marriage
[1:05:26] supper of the lamb he saith unto me
[1:05:28] these are the true sayings of god
[1:05:30] now brother branham picks that up at the
[1:05:32] end of his ministry he said in the day
[1:05:34] the son of man will be revealed what to
[1:05:36] join the church to the head unite the
[1:05:38] marriage of the bride the bridegroom
[1:05:40] call will come right through this when
[1:05:41] the son of man will come down and come
[1:05:43] in human flesh to unite the two together
[1:05:46] he said the church has to be the word he
[1:05:48] is the word and the two unites together
[1:05:51] and to do that it'll take the
[1:05:52] manifestation of the revealing of the
[1:05:54] son of man he said not a clergyman see
[1:05:57] it son of man jesus christ will come
[1:05:59] down in human flesh among us will make
[1:06:01] his word so real that it'll oh my aren't
[1:06:04] you glad he did it in our hour
[1:06:06] he said it'll make his words so real
[1:06:09] amen he said that it'll unite the church
[1:06:12] and him as one the bride and then she'll
[1:06:13] go home to the wedding supper
[1:06:17] he goes a little further he says she's
[1:06:18] already united we go to the wedding
[1:06:20] supper not to the marriage
[1:06:23] he said fill the uh the flesh of the
[1:06:25] mighty men because the marriage of the
[1:06:26] lamb has come
[1:06:27] he said but the rapture is going to the
[1:06:29] wedding supper
[1:06:31] when the word here unites with the
[1:06:33] person
[1:06:35] oh my
[1:06:36] the word here unites with the person
[1:06:39] they to become one now watch
[1:06:41] and that's what we want
[1:06:43] that's what we want we want to become
[1:06:45] one with this word how many believe that
[1:06:47] today
[1:06:48] what does it do then it manifests the
[1:06:50] son of man
[1:06:51] again yes
[1:06:53] and this is the part now listen to me if
[1:06:56] you're waiting on brother branham to
[1:06:58] come back
[1:07:00] and and manifest the son of man again
[1:07:03] so that you can then put your dress on
[1:07:05] get ready and be dressed in the word to
[1:07:06] be ready for a rapture you've missed it
[1:07:10] you've missed the entire message
[1:07:13] that's what the message was yes come on
[1:07:17] it'd be like you you showed up late for
[1:07:19] the wedding and you're waiting on the
[1:07:21] preacher the preacher was already here
[1:07:25] amen the clergyman already stood there
[1:07:28] and he stood there for the bill and he
[1:07:29] and he said here's the groom here's
[1:07:31] surprise let's unite the two together
[1:07:34] come on oh god
[1:07:37] oh my and i had a brother pointing out
[1:07:38] to me the other day actually last night
[1:07:40] i was talking to a brother and he said
[1:07:42] you know when brother ran him in the
[1:07:43] breach he begins to talk to him at the
[1:07:45] end of that he said now by the power
[1:07:46] invested in me and he began to talk
[1:07:48] about it like that and i believed that
[1:07:50] god was doing something he was uniting
[1:07:53] he was using the language of a wedding
[1:07:55] ceremony uniting what was it the bride
[1:07:57] with the groom
[1:07:58] the marriage of the lamb has come
[1:08:01] let us be glad and rejoice
[1:08:03] this is the time for the celebration
[1:08:07] are you with me this morning we're not
[1:08:09] going we're not sitting there worried
[1:08:11] and scared well maybe he'll accept me
[1:08:13] maybe he won't i've i got to get my life
[1:08:15] just right so he'll accept me no you you
[1:08:18] already chose him before the foundation
[1:08:19] of the world you're his bride you belong
[1:08:21] to him
[1:08:24] the marriage of the lamb has come yes
[1:08:27] and his bride has made herself ready
[1:08:30] but what's she what's she dressing for
[1:08:32] now
[1:08:33] the wedding supper
[1:08:36] think about it what she's getting
[1:08:37] dressed for
[1:08:39] again my
[1:08:40] my wife
[1:08:42] wear just about anything i'd be okay
[1:08:43] with it just about anything
[1:08:46] long as it was decent
[1:08:49] she cares
[1:08:53] oh god i hope you hear it today
[1:08:56] she cares
[1:08:58] what she wears
[1:09:00] you brothers know that you take your
[1:09:02] wife out to eat at a nice restaurant
[1:09:04] she cares
[1:09:06] way more than you do
[1:09:08] even about what you wear
[1:09:13] go to one of these banquets
[1:09:15] you know if it was up if it was just men
[1:09:16] in the church that made all the
[1:09:17] decisions you know i know i know that
[1:09:20] men are in leadership but if just men
[1:09:21] made all the decisions we would never
[1:09:23] have banquets
[1:09:26] we would just all go over and eat
[1:09:27] together and it'd be all ages and then
[1:09:29] and we'd sit us men would sit together
[1:09:31] and tell hunting stories and we'd be
[1:09:32] there in our camo and
[1:09:34] and and all of that and and the reason
[1:09:36] we have banquets where we dress up is
[1:09:38] not because of the men
[1:09:40] it's because of the desire
[1:09:42] that a woman has
[1:09:44] in her heart to present herself in a
[1:09:46] certain way
[1:09:47] not for somebody else
[1:09:50] or you hear me today she's got a desire
[1:09:52] in her heart to present herself to her
[1:09:54] husband
[1:09:55] that's my desire today that's why i want
[1:09:57] to have church the way he taught us to
[1:09:59] have church that's why i want to have a
[1:10:01] a church that that is like that first
[1:10:03] church i want to i want to see a bride
[1:10:05] presented to him clothed in the word not
[1:10:08] because i have to do that to gain his
[1:10:11] favor but because he's already given me
[1:10:14] his favor he slipped his wedding band on
[1:10:16] me i'm married to the word so i want to
[1:10:18] be dressed in it what is that i want to
[1:10:20] apply it to my life
[1:10:23] because every bit of it's true my
[1:10:25] foundation is on it let me apply it let
[1:10:27] me live it
[1:10:30] but that frees you then from the
[1:10:33] the worry and the fear
[1:10:35] you don't get dressed for a banquet out
[1:10:37] of fear
[1:10:40] are you with me now
[1:10:43] i'm gonna miss it how could you miss it
[1:10:45] you're his wife
[1:10:48] the preacher already came and went
[1:10:51] i'll wait on the preacher to come back
[1:10:52] well the preacher was here
[1:10:54] none said the wedding vows for those who
[1:10:56] would do it
[1:10:57] for those who would believe it
[1:11:01] oh god
[1:11:04] look she's getting dressed for an event
[1:11:07] and in doing that she becomes it
[1:11:09] manifests the son of man again not the
[1:11:11] church theologian the son of man the
[1:11:13] word in the church becomes one whatever
[1:11:15] the son of man done he was the word the
[1:11:17] church does the same thing you say oh
[1:11:18] son of man ministry son of man ministry
[1:11:20] but what's happening today son of man
[1:11:22] ministry
[1:11:24] in the church
[1:11:26] that's what brother branham taught us
[1:11:28] the church does the same thing now watch
[1:11:31] the process of courtship engagement
[1:11:33] preparation all of that is over
[1:11:36] that's the church ages
[1:11:39] think about it she's his wife now
[1:11:43] and they without us could not be made
[1:11:45] perfect because this is marrying time
[1:11:47] so there was something that took place
[1:11:49] in this age but even when we get there
[1:11:51] it won't be well
[1:11:53] luther you know he did certain things
[1:11:54] and he believed certain things that were
[1:11:55] not right but he's going to say the same
[1:11:57] waiting supper that we do
[1:11:59] because of us
[1:12:01] right because we complete it
[1:12:04] and so it's imputed to them who only had
[1:12:06] light for their hour because we followed
[1:12:09] the light for our hour
[1:12:11] right they without us could not be made
[1:12:12] perfect now so we're getting dressed up
[1:12:14] for an event the process is over we're
[1:12:17] his wife
[1:12:18] oh we could get a revelation of that
[1:12:20] today
[1:12:21] you say well i don't i'm worried i need
[1:12:24] i need to know who i am you're his wife
[1:12:26] you belong to god and no matter what
[1:12:28] happens around you your marriage might
[1:12:30] shake your church might shake the world
[1:12:33] might shake politics might shake
[1:12:35] everything that can be shaken will be
[1:12:37] shaken but you're going to stand why
[1:12:39] you're married to the word that's your
[1:12:41] foundation
[1:12:43] amen you belong to the creator of the
[1:12:45] universe you're his wife you you belong
[1:12:48] to him and you're anxiously see how that
[1:12:50] changes the mindset you're anxiously
[1:12:52] waiting preparing for that wedding that
[1:12:55] wedding banquet in the sky
[1:12:57] and it is the wedding it's the last part
[1:12:59] of the wedding
[1:13:01] but you're already married
[1:13:04] hallelujah
[1:13:07] amen
[1:13:09] now
[1:13:11] after the vows have been made and the
[1:13:12] ring is on her finger the veil is on his
[1:13:14] shoulder
[1:13:16] but the reception in heaven is about to
[1:13:18] begin
[1:13:21] now it's still part of the wedding
[1:13:24] that began in his mind before the
[1:13:25] foundation of the earth and we're now
[1:13:26] waiting
[1:13:27] on the marriage supper
[1:13:29] we are already amen we have the
[1:13:33] mechanics and the dynamics
[1:13:35] brandon taught us the dynamics already
[1:13:37] here
[1:13:39] right we have the mechanics in the
[1:13:40] dining we're not waiting on some revival
[1:13:42] to give us the mechanics and the
[1:13:43] dynamics they're here
[1:13:45] he said he being the groom the bride has
[1:13:47] to come forth because it's part of him
[1:13:48] it can only be the manifestation of the
[1:13:50] fulfilling of all the revelations any
[1:13:52] others have spoke of the bride it can
[1:13:54] only manifest
[1:13:55] let's see how we live in it can only
[1:13:57] manifest it does something different
[1:13:59] from the groom it isn't the bride
[1:14:01] because she's flesh of his flesh you've
[1:14:03] all heard it before but now listen in
[1:14:05] this context this is who you already are
[1:14:09] not she will become flesh of his flesh
[1:14:11] she is flesh of his flesh bone of his
[1:14:14] bone life of his life
[1:14:16] power of his power he said well i
[1:14:18] haven't become that you just walk in
[1:14:20] that word today walk into that light
[1:14:23] become that yourself as an individual
[1:14:25] this is marriage time
[1:14:28] she's flesh of his flesh bone of his
[1:14:30] bone life of his life power of his power
[1:14:33] she is him
[1:14:35] not she will be him she's going to be
[1:14:37] him she is him
[1:14:40] glorious man and woman are one and woman
[1:14:42] taken from his side she had taken the
[1:14:44] spirit the feminist spirit from him the
[1:14:46] flesh from his side made both mechanics
[1:14:49] and dynamics the wife
[1:14:52] glory she is mechanics and dynamics
[1:14:57] that's why we don't settle for a dead
[1:14:59] church
[1:15:01] we don't settle for dead religion
[1:15:03] we don't settle for emptiness
[1:15:06] and doom and gloom theologies
[1:15:09] we settle for only for the word
[1:15:11] the word is right
[1:15:13] somebody's wrong
[1:15:15] the black church and i thought of that
[1:15:17] last week when i was preparing those
[1:15:19] sermons the black church used to sing a
[1:15:20] song they said i know the bible is right
[1:15:23] and the congregation says somebody's
[1:15:24] wrong
[1:15:28] that's right because a lot of people are
[1:15:29] not following the bible but i know the
[1:15:31] bible is right
[1:15:33] somebody's wrong
[1:15:34] but the bible is right i may be wrong
[1:15:37] but the bible is right
[1:15:39] amen that's how i'm married to him i
[1:15:41] become one with the word
[1:15:44] amen
[1:15:46] and i can only do that
[1:15:48] by the message of the hour
[1:15:50] now watch and we'll continue on that now
[1:15:52] hold that in your thoughts as we move on
[1:15:54] she was chosen in him according to
[1:15:57] according to ephesians 1 4 according as
[1:15:59] he had chosen us in him before the
[1:16:01] foundation of the world that we should
[1:16:03] be holy without blame before him in love
[1:16:05] we were chosen there
[1:16:07] yeah say well if i get dressed in the
[1:16:08] word i'll i'll i'll finally be chosen by
[1:16:11] him you were chosen there
[1:16:13] he slipped the ring on you there
[1:16:16] i want you to watch this morning as we
[1:16:17] kind of move away and we'll come back
[1:16:20] but jesus first miracle was performed at
[1:16:22] a wedding reception
[1:16:25] i've often been puzzled by that
[1:16:28] seems almost meaningless but brother
[1:16:30] branham actually had
[1:16:31] an answer for that he shined light on
[1:16:33] that scripture let's look at that in
[1:16:35] john chapter 2 and verse 1. it said the
[1:16:37] third day there was a marriage in cana
[1:16:39] of galilee the mother of jesus was there
[1:16:42] listen nothing happens in your life by
[1:16:44] accident
[1:16:45] there's a purpose
[1:16:47] and both jesus was called and his
[1:16:49] disciples to the marriage now back then
[1:16:51] if you were called if you were invited
[1:16:53] it was more than just getting an
[1:16:54] invitation in the mail is today but it
[1:16:56] was a great dishonor to the family if
[1:16:59] you were invited and didn't come
[1:17:01] so jesus and his disciples were invited
[1:17:04] to this marriage the bible said blessed
[1:17:06] are they which are called
[1:17:08] to the marriage supper of the lamb now
[1:17:10] watch john 2 3 and when they wanted wine
[1:17:13] the mother of jesus saith unto them
[1:17:15] saith unto him they have no wine
[1:17:18] no she wasn't expecting to go buy wine
[1:17:24] she knew who he was
[1:17:26] she said they have no wine jesus says in
[1:17:29] her woman what have i to do with thee
[1:17:32] mine hour has not yet come
[1:17:35] his mother saith unto the servants i
[1:17:38] love how she didn't even respond to him
[1:17:42] that's how mothers do right
[1:17:45] she don't even listen mom
[1:17:48] what are you doing
[1:17:50] i said mom and mom looked at me
[1:17:53] what are you doing
[1:17:55] they have no wine jesus
[1:17:57] said woman what am i going to do with
[1:17:58] you
[1:18:00] his mother his mother said the servants
[1:18:02] just do
[1:18:03] whatever he says
[1:18:07] glory
[1:18:08] hey man she believed
[1:18:10] and so he does an odd thing
[1:18:12] he takes water
[1:18:14] now the water was there for the purpose
[1:18:16] of making wine
[1:18:19] right that's where they got the water
[1:18:21] there was water there but they didn't
[1:18:23] have the grapes and the process of
[1:18:26] making wine out of it they may have had
[1:18:27] the grapes there in the water but it
[1:18:29] takes longer than that to make wine
[1:18:32] right so they would have gone through
[1:18:34] the process of making wine and so he has
[1:18:37] them pour it in the wine the water into
[1:18:38] wine vessels if you go down to verse 9
[1:18:41] it says when the ruler of the feast had
[1:18:42] tasted the water that was made wine and
[1:18:44] knew not whence it was but the servants
[1:18:46] which drew the water knew the governor
[1:18:48] of the feast called the bridegroom
[1:18:51] and he saith unto him every man at the
[1:18:53] beginning does set forth good wine he
[1:18:55] said this is great when men have well
[1:18:58] drunk then that which is then that which
[1:19:00] is worse so in other words what they're
[1:19:01] doing is they get them to taste the good
[1:19:03] wine and they'll say well the wine at
[1:19:05] that wedding was so good
[1:19:07] and then after they've after they've
[1:19:09] drank enough wine that they can't tell
[1:19:11] the difference
[1:19:13] right
[1:19:14] then they water down the line that's
[1:19:16] what they did
[1:19:18] it was a very common practice they
[1:19:19] watered it down until there was almost
[1:19:20] nothing in it so
[1:19:22] and so they just continued whenever you
[1:19:24] were running out of wine you just add
[1:19:25] water to it but somebody forgot to add
[1:19:27] the water and now they're panicking
[1:19:28] they're out of wine
[1:19:30] jesus doesn't add water to existing wine
[1:19:32] because this wine was better than the
[1:19:34] original wine
[1:19:37] glory so now what does he do he says
[1:19:40] thou has kept the good wine until now
[1:19:42] and it said this beginning of miracles
[1:19:44] did jesus in cain of galilee and
[1:19:46] manifested forth his glory and his
[1:19:48] disciples believed on him now brother
[1:19:50] branham taught us that this miracle
[1:19:52] spoke of the resurrection
[1:19:55] this miracle done at a wedding supper
[1:19:58] spoke of the resurrection
[1:20:00] now think about it he said he is god you
[1:20:04] fail to see who he is
[1:20:06] he's the unchanging god
[1:20:09] he said i'm glad i got faith in him
[1:20:10] tonight that someday when my life my
[1:20:13] body with its 16 elements will be back
[1:20:16] in the dust
[1:20:17] of the earth
[1:20:19] now listen i told you last week i'm more
[1:20:22] certain when i bury a saint in the
[1:20:24] ground
[1:20:25] that i'll see them again
[1:20:27] than i am that i'll see someone if i
[1:20:29] tell them i'll see you later at the
[1:20:31] house
[1:20:32] because
[1:20:33] lots of things could happen between now
[1:20:35] and then but when we commit our loved
[1:20:37] ones to the ground
[1:20:38] we're certain we'll see them again
[1:20:40] because the bible says that we will
[1:20:43] right and so now
[1:20:45] now this is a type of the resurrection
[1:20:47] now watch
[1:20:48] he he said it's six feet elements will
[1:20:50] be back in the dust of the earth but he
[1:20:52] will say william branham
[1:20:54] and i'll come forth
[1:20:56] oh god
[1:20:58] he will breathe the breath of life into
[1:21:00] it
[1:21:01] say there you are
[1:21:03] he will bypass the birth through my
[1:21:05] mother and so forth
[1:21:07] and you find different places where
[1:21:08] brother branham taught this it's not
[1:21:09] just one quote he said like jesus on his
[1:21:12] first miracle he turned water into wine
[1:21:16] eventually it would have been wine but
[1:21:18] he bypassed all that procedure
[1:21:21] oh glory
[1:21:23] oh my and said turn the water to wine
[1:21:26] so he said at the resurrection he will
[1:21:28] not say mr and mrs branham get married
[1:21:30] again speaking of his parents and bring
[1:21:32] forth william he will speak and i'll
[1:21:34] come forth
[1:21:36] how many believe that today
[1:21:38] he will speak and i'll come forth that's
[1:21:40] him he's god so he was showing
[1:21:42] oh god that he could take something
[1:21:45] bypass the process and make a
[1:21:47] resurrection of the wine
[1:21:50] are you with me now
[1:21:51] he's bringing a resurrection
[1:21:53] and he'll not say
[1:21:54] you know go get married and come through
[1:21:56] the natural process but it's in a moment
[1:21:58] and a twinkling of an eye at the last
[1:22:00] trump we shall not all sleep but we
[1:22:02] shall all be changed
[1:22:03] are you with me now yes
[1:22:05] now watch now we take this this wedding
[1:22:07] supper that's where it was done at
[1:22:10] listen there's going to be a moment and
[1:22:12] a twinkling of an eye i can't explain
[1:22:13] every bit of it but i know this i'll see
[1:22:15] my loved ones and then we'll be changed
[1:22:17] in a moment in the twinkling of an eye
[1:22:20] now watch again i don't want to get into
[1:22:22] the detail say well this happens first
[1:22:23] and this does but i do know this it'll
[1:22:25] happen in an instant
[1:22:27] and it's a sudden secret going away of
[1:22:29] the church so there's not going to be a
[1:22:30] warning or anything like that it has to
[1:22:32] be that way that's the way the word says
[1:22:34] in such an hour that you think not
[1:22:36] that's the hour that the lord comes now
[1:22:37] watch as we begin to look at that you
[1:22:39] begin to realize when that happens the
[1:22:41] water is changed into wine and we'll
[1:22:43] find ourselves
[1:22:45] at a wedding banquet
[1:22:48] oh god
[1:22:50] we find ourselves what at a wedding
[1:22:52] maker what are we doing now
[1:22:55] getting ready for that banquet
[1:22:59] oh god
[1:23:01] he said well again i'm afraid i won't
[1:23:03] make it
[1:23:05] i might miss it
[1:23:09] what wife would say that
[1:23:12] she's not saying well i
[1:23:14] if i don't dress correctly my husband's
[1:23:15] going to kick me out of the
[1:23:18] car you don't have a husband you have a
[1:23:21] tyrant
[1:23:25] we don't serve a tyrant that's right
[1:23:29] are you hearing me this morning we don't
[1:23:31] serve a tyrant
[1:23:32] we serve
[1:23:34] jehovah god to become a man
[1:23:38] become our bridegroom and type you
[1:23:40] understand
[1:23:41] now watch
[1:23:42] he is our bridegroom he loves us he's
[1:23:45] already committed to us and we have
[1:23:47] committed to him
[1:23:50] we are not making ourselves pleasing to
[1:23:52] him in order to be married
[1:23:55] but we are making ourselves ready
[1:23:58] our overcoming is not in
[1:24:01] making ourself working our way into a
[1:24:04] position
[1:24:05] of being able to call ourselves bride
[1:24:08] that it's a misconception that's not how
[1:24:10] we overcome
[1:24:12] we overcome because we are the bride
[1:24:17] we're not working our way into position
[1:24:19] of being able to be called the bribe
[1:24:20] we're already his wife his wife made
[1:24:22] herself ready why did she make herself
[1:24:24] ready because she's going to a banquet
[1:24:28] amen she wants to be pleasing to him not
[1:24:30] because she's afraid that he'll say
[1:24:32] something
[1:24:33] derogatory to her
[1:24:36] right not because she's afraid that the
[1:24:38] preacher will get up on sunday and
[1:24:39] preach on a short skirt so she she gotta
[1:24:41] wear them she don't she wants to dress
[1:24:43] like the world does but she's afraid
[1:24:47] hear me peter messed up the title this
[1:24:49] morning and peter i'm not picking on you
[1:24:52] this morning and he had
[1:24:53] uh i actually called this uh uh dressed
[1:24:57] in the word and he put it dressed in the
[1:24:59] world
[1:25:01] and it's just a little bit of difference
[1:25:02] there
[1:25:03] that'd actually be a good title but
[1:25:06] it sounds like a dress code sermon
[1:25:08] and that's actually not what this is at
[1:25:10] all
[1:25:11] our dress code is the word men and women
[1:25:13] alike
[1:25:15] are you with me now but we don't go
[1:25:16] around saying oh you know what as a
[1:25:18] preacher you know if he knew what i did
[1:25:20] then i'd be in trouble and you sit in
[1:25:21] condemnation all the time you don't know
[1:25:23] who you are you don't know where you
[1:25:24] belong why don't you just let go of that
[1:25:27] become the wife of the lamb
[1:25:30] let go of that condemnation and that
[1:25:32] worry and that strife just become his
[1:25:33] wife say lord i lay my i put the i put
[1:25:37] the authority on you i put the
[1:25:39] responsibility on you i'm giving it to
[1:25:41] you i don't care what the others might
[1:25:44] say they may laugh and make fun of me
[1:25:46] i'm going to dress in the word because
[1:25:47] i'm going home to the banquet
[1:25:50] glory i've already been i've already
[1:25:52] been there i hope you hear me today i've
[1:25:54] already been intimate with my my husband
[1:25:57] i've already he's i've already felt the
[1:25:59] kiss of eternal selection i know what it
[1:26:02] is to be his bride to be redeemed i'm
[1:26:05] not worried that he doesn't love me
[1:26:08] are you hearing me today you need to get
[1:26:09] that revelation now
[1:26:13] not try trying to work your way through
[1:26:14] it
[1:26:16] you're ready now you want to please him
[1:26:19] not because the pastor might say
[1:26:20] something or somebody else might
[1:26:22] i want to do what's right because he
[1:26:24] wants it
[1:26:26] he desires it
[1:26:28] not because he would say something but
[1:26:30] i just i want what he wants yes
[1:26:33] are you with me today we're
[1:26:35] we so we dress ourselves in the word
[1:26:38] now watch

[1:26:42] garment
[1:26:44] to her was granted she should be reading
[1:26:45] fine linen and clean and white for the
[1:26:47] fine linens the righteousness of saints
[1:26:48] contrast that with revelation 17 3
[1:26:51] here is a woman who calls herself the
[1:26:53] bride of christ
[1:26:55] right revelation 17 she calls herself
[1:26:58] the church
[1:26:59] the catholic church the universal church
[1:27:03] and all of her daughters they're with
[1:27:05] her
[1:27:06] denominational daughters he said i saw a
[1:27:08] woman sit upon a scarlet colored beast
[1:27:10] full of names of blasphemy having seven
[1:27:12] heads and ten horns
[1:27:14] and the woman was arrayed in purple and
[1:27:17] scarlet color
[1:27:18] and deck so she was dressed
[1:27:21] how she wanted to be dressed
[1:27:25] you hear me today
[1:27:26] she was dressed
[1:27:28] how she wanted to be dressed
[1:27:30] she was at a banquet but not his
[1:27:34] she's seated at a table she's drinking
[1:27:36] the wine but not his
[1:27:38] yes are you with me today yeah she's
[1:27:41] dressed how she wants to be dressed
[1:27:44] we don't get to pick and choose how we
[1:27:45] have church
[1:27:49] it don't matter if you say well nobody
[1:27:51] believes it like that so and so believes
[1:27:53] it differently it doesn't matter we
[1:27:55] don't get to pick and choose how we have
[1:27:56] church
[1:27:57] we don't get to pick and choose whether
[1:27:59] or not there are preachers today
[1:28:02] we don't get to pick and choose whether
[1:28:03] there's healing today or not
[1:28:06] we don't get to pick and choose whether
[1:28:07] there's salvation today
[1:28:09] we believe the word
[1:28:11] you believe the word today we don't get
[1:28:13] to pick and choose how what we should do
[1:28:15] but we go to the bible
[1:28:17] amen and then we take that we begin to
[1:28:19] apply it
[1:28:20] now watch the fine now here's this woman
[1:28:23] and i'll skip down to revelation 18
[1:28:26] and and 16 how the merchants were
[1:28:28] weeping and wailing and over this woman
[1:28:31] that was there and says that woman was
[1:28:33] clothed in fine linen
[1:28:35] just like the bride was
[1:28:38] and purple
[1:28:41] and scarlet
[1:28:43] and decked with gold
[1:28:45] and precious stones and pearls so she
[1:28:47] had the fine line and she said oh i
[1:28:48] believe the word
[1:28:50] and everything else
[1:28:53] but the bride was only dressed in the
[1:28:55] final inning
[1:28:57] clean and white
[1:28:58] you remember esther
[1:29:00] when she'd come before the king i told
[1:29:02] you christ is in every book of the bible
[1:29:04] book of esther doesn't even mention god
[1:29:07] but esther herself some type of the
[1:29:09] bride and she's standing there and she
[1:29:11] tells the chamberlain i'm standing there
[1:29:13] he said what do you want what do you
[1:29:14] want to be dressed in to go to the king
[1:29:16] she said i'll trust you
[1:29:18] i'll trust you to know what the king
[1:29:20] likes
[1:29:21] i'll trust the word amen to know what
[1:29:23] the king likes i'll trust it to know
[1:29:25] that that's what he wants
[1:29:28] she just dressed herself simply in
[1:29:29] whatever was provided to her that's what
[1:29:32] we have to do we must stress ourselves
[1:29:34] in the provided word and not because we
[1:29:36] we're gaining the favor of christ but
[1:29:38] because we've already gained his favor
[1:29:42] the bible said his wife has made herself
[1:29:44] ready at the end of the age how did she
[1:29:45] make yourself ready to becoming his wife
[1:29:47] he said what is she what kind of a
[1:29:49] garment she had on his own word she was
[1:29:52] stressed
[1:29:53] in his righteousness
[1:29:56] now
[1:29:56] think about it for just a moment before
[1:29:58] we close what
[1:30:00] what are the essential things that you
[1:30:01] need other than address
[1:30:03] to be ready
[1:30:05] to go out and eat
[1:30:07] and just think about it
[1:30:09] well if you if someone put you in a room
[1:30:12] and gave you a garment to put on
[1:30:15] what are the things the essential things
[1:30:17] that you would need
[1:30:19] two things one of them i've got to get
[1:30:21] in that
[1:30:23] back room
[1:30:25] you know what it is a mirror
[1:30:28] all right you got to have a mirror
[1:30:30] to dress properly you'll end up like me
[1:30:32] and your collar is always over your
[1:30:34] over your coat
[1:30:37] and there's a reason one is my neck is
[1:30:39] so big and the other you can laugh at
[1:30:40] that that's fine
[1:30:42] and i can't find a shirt that'll fit and
[1:30:44] the other one is that that
[1:30:46] i don't have a mirror on the door and so
[1:30:47] i'll come out sometimes last minutes you
[1:30:49] know doing something and and i put my my
[1:30:51] coat on last and the caller comes up
[1:30:53] over it brother joel has to make motions
[1:30:56] and do all this try to get me to do it
[1:30:58] to put it down i'm glad he does that but
[1:31:00] you know
[1:31:01] you know what you need a mirror
[1:31:03] but if you put in a room there's one
[1:31:05] other essential thing that you need
[1:31:08] you can't get dressed without it well
[1:31:10] you can
[1:31:11] but you shouldn't
[1:31:13] light
[1:31:16] what do you think i was going to say
[1:31:21] light
[1:31:24] think about it
[1:31:26] i'm so glad there's a man here that can
[1:31:28] turn on the light
[1:31:32] we're put in the room here we are with
[1:31:35] the garment
[1:31:36] how are we going to how are we going to
[1:31:37] dress in this word you can't do it
[1:31:40] without the message of the hour
[1:31:42] are you hearing me this morning the
[1:31:44] message is the light of the hour
[1:31:47] you can't be dressed in the word oh god
[1:31:50] if we just understand it today you
[1:31:51] cannot be dressed in the word without
[1:31:53] the message of the hour because listen
[1:31:55] when they'll be there at that table with
[1:31:56] us luther and luther's day they could
[1:31:58] not be dressed in luther's message
[1:32:00] without luther's light
[1:32:02] are you hearing me wesley say they could
[1:32:03] not be dressed in wesley's message
[1:32:05] without wesley's site pentecostal age
[1:32:07] the same and in this age we cannot be
[1:32:09] dressed in the word for this hour to go
[1:32:12] home to the banquet unless the light of
[1:32:14] the hour shines on the word
[1:32:16] the message is absolutely indispensable
[1:32:19] are you with me today it's not the bible
[1:32:21] but it's the light in the room
[1:32:24] that lets us put the bible on
[1:32:27] because the bible laid there for 2 000
[1:32:29] years and it laid there and men had all
[1:32:30] kinds of opinions but a prophet come out
[1:32:33] a simple kentucky hillbilly that may be
[1:32:35] beyond what you can believe but i
[1:32:37] believe that god is a supernatural god i
[1:32:39] believe god called john the baptist out
[1:32:41] of the wilderness wearing camel's hair
[1:32:43] and eating locusts and drink and wild
[1:32:44] honey but he was god's prophet
[1:32:47] god called the kentucky hillbilly out of
[1:32:49] the hills of kentucky and he come to
[1:32:51] shine light amen
[1:32:53] he was not the bridegroom but he pointed
[1:32:55] us to the bridegroom
[1:32:58] hey man in the present stage of my
[1:33:00] ministry brother branham picks it up and
[1:33:02] he you remember the vision that was
[1:33:04] there you go back and listen to it he
[1:33:06] told the vision about his ministry
[1:33:09] how he was there was the hog lot
[1:33:11] remember the hog lot and then
[1:33:13] and i'm skipping through it just to jog
[1:33:15] your memory but then there was
[1:33:17] his tabernacle and then he said this is
[1:33:20] not your tabernacle
[1:33:22] he showed him the fruit trees
[1:33:24] planted in buckets
[1:33:25] and all of those things how his ministry
[1:33:27] would be stand between the oneness and
[1:33:29] the trinity
[1:33:31] and he showed him and the voice spoke to
[1:33:33] him and said second timothy 4 1-5
[1:33:36] and so he began to read it and it's
[1:33:39] second timothy 4 1 i charge thee
[1:33:41] therefore before god and the lord jesus
[1:33:43] christ who shall judge the quick and the
[1:33:45] dead and his appearing and his kingdom
[1:33:47] preach the word
[1:33:50] amen be instant in season and out of
[1:33:53] season reprove rebuke exhort with all
[1:33:55] long-suffering and doctrine for the time
[1:33:57] will come and they will not endure sound
[1:33:59] doctrine but after their own lust shall
[1:34:01] they heap to themselves teachers having
[1:34:02] itching ears
[1:34:04] they shall turn away their ears from the
[1:34:06] truth and shall be turned unto fables
[1:34:08] but watch thou in all things and do
[1:34:10] reflections do the work of an evangelist
[1:34:13] make full proof of thy ministry brother
[1:34:15] brown said he always stopped there
[1:34:18] but he went on in that sermon to tell
[1:34:21] the rest of the story which is kind of
[1:34:22] sad if you think about it
[1:34:24] because he's nearing the end of his
[1:34:26] ministry brother branham knows it
[1:34:29] and this was in 1962 i believe it was
[1:34:32] just right before
[1:34:34] right before
[1:34:36] brother branham goes into the opening of
[1:34:37] the word
[1:34:39] and so he begins to preach it yes
[1:34:40] september of 1962
[1:34:43] and he reads the next verse he said
[1:34:45] always read verses one through five
[1:34:47] the next verse i'm now ready to be
[1:34:48] offered the time of my departure is at
[1:34:50] hand
[1:34:52] and so brother the random says there
[1:34:53] must be a crowning as there was a
[1:34:54] crowning of paul's ministry even though
[1:34:56] it looked like his ministry was over
[1:34:58] yet he's in he's writing philippians in
[1:35:02] jail
[1:35:04] writing about joy i want to get into
[1:35:06] that at some point it's wonderful he
[1:35:08] writes that from jail
[1:35:10] count it all joy
[1:35:12] and how we should think and how we
[1:35:14] should be and so
[1:35:15] and it's the crowning of his ministry
[1:35:18] it's the third poll of his ministry but
[1:35:20] now he he realizes there must be a
[1:35:22] crowning to his own ministry
[1:35:24] and he said you see it's at that time
[1:35:26] when men forsake men god's servants that
[1:35:28] stay true to the word god seals their
[1:35:31] ministry with a crowning time yes
[1:35:34] oh god i hope i can get through this now
[1:35:36] by 12 o'clock and i'll let you go he
[1:35:38] said i wasn't disobedient to the
[1:35:39] heavenly vision that happened down there
[1:35:41] on the river i've stayed true to it he's
[1:35:42] been true to me i'm trusting in him
[1:35:44] someday i don't know when for a crowning
[1:35:46] of my ministry he said i've stayed just
[1:35:48] as true as i could be i don't know what
[1:35:50] it'll be i don't know when it'll be i
[1:35:53] just when he's ready i am i don't care
[1:35:55] he said i hope he i hope i love this he
[1:35:58] will crown my ministry of this
[1:36:01] now he didn't say of of going and and
[1:36:05] people recognizing all oh this is
[1:36:07] brother branham
[1:36:08] and becoming oral roberts or building a
[1:36:10] big school or doing something like that
[1:36:13] but he said letting me take the clothes
[1:36:15] of the word
[1:36:16] and dress his bride in the clothes of
[1:36:18] the word for his righteousness
[1:36:21] i hope he will crown me let me stand on
[1:36:25] that day
[1:36:26] and say behold the lamb of god
[1:36:30] oh god
[1:36:32] that takes away the sin of the world he
[1:36:33] said okay well we'll just wait on him to
[1:36:35] do that what what have you been doing
[1:36:39] what have you been studying all these
[1:36:40] years
[1:36:42] brother branham then in
[1:36:44] in the feast of the trumpets he said the
[1:36:45] bride must step out of the way to go up
[1:36:47] now so the two servants of god in
[1:36:49] revelation the two prophets can appear
[1:36:50] upon the scene the sound the seventh
[1:36:52] trumpet to them make known to them the
[1:36:54] christ the seventh angel messenger
[1:36:57] and watch they behold the lamb of god
[1:37:00] that takes away the sin of the world he
[1:37:02] said i hope that my crowning would be to
[1:37:04] dress so bright in the word by saying
[1:37:06] behold the lamb of god
[1:37:08] are you hearing me today here he stands
[1:37:10] and says behold the lamb of god that
[1:37:12] takes away the sin of the world not
[1:37:13] behold my methodist my baptist my
[1:37:15] pentecostal but the word
[1:37:17] what is he doing showing us who the lamb
[1:37:19] is picking him out of a crowd
[1:37:22] john had to identify him pick the lamb
[1:37:24] out of a crowd there was a crowd of
[1:37:25] people they all looked the same but john
[1:37:27] identified him he said behold the lamb
[1:37:30] pointed him out to the people and
[1:37:31] brother branham identified the word in
[1:37:33] our hour the word
[1:37:35] amen the word of the hour and he looked
[1:37:37] at it he said behold the lamb
[1:37:39] behold the lamb the open book in our
[1:37:42] hour taking that takes away the sins of
[1:37:44] the world
[1:37:45] amen not my baptist my pentecostals but
[1:37:48] the word the son of god the lamb of god
[1:37:50] that takes away the sin of the world for
[1:37:52] no other foundation is there you believe
[1:37:54] that today
[1:37:56] amen he said how long have we got the
[1:37:57] jews are in their homeland the bride is
[1:38:00] called yes
[1:38:02] oh god
[1:38:05] go you have to meet him
[1:38:07] the bride's called
[1:38:09] she's now his wife
[1:38:12] you realize what howard we're living in
[1:38:15] everything just exactly what he promised
[1:38:17] we're ready
[1:38:18] we're ready
[1:38:20] so then 1964 we're ready
[1:38:23] the hour is
[1:38:25] here
[1:38:27] amen
[1:38:29] you come into a dark age
[1:38:31] a layer of cnh
[1:38:33] here was the garment
[1:38:35] here was the bride
[1:38:37] she's seated in that dark room and she
[1:38:38] don't know how to dress herself
[1:38:40] she comes out with the tag turned around
[1:38:43] messed up
[1:38:45] can't see
[1:38:47] tears on her face trying to get ready
[1:38:49] and here comes the man who can turn on
[1:38:50] the light and flips the switch
[1:38:54] that's what the message is
[1:38:58] behold the lamb of god
[1:39:02] who takes away the sins of the world yes
[1:39:04] so brother branham after reading the
[1:39:05] scripture musicians go ahead and
[1:39:10] come he reads the scripture the bride
[1:39:13] has made herself afraid he said so
