[30:04] Heavenly Father,
[30:06] we are so grateful in our hearts that we
[30:09] can call you father.
[30:12] &gt;&gt; We thank you Lord Jesus for all that you
[30:14] have given us, Lord.
[30:16] And Father God, we know Lord that in
[30:18] this journey of life there's many trials
[30:21] and there's many valleys.
[30:24] Lord, you never said that we wouldn't
[30:26] have afflictions, that we wouldn't have
[30:27] trials, that we wouldn't suffer.
[30:30] But Lord, you did say that you'd never
[30:32] leave us, nor would you forsake us.
[30:34] &gt;&gt; And you said, Lord, that you would be
[30:36] our healer and our deliverer and our
[30:38] sustainer. So Lord, we look to you this
[30:41] morning for these needs, dear God,
[30:42] that's written down. Lord, it's
[30:44] someone's loved one that's suffering.
[30:47] But I pray, Lord, at the anointing that
[30:49] raised my Lord, from the grave, may that
[30:52] anointing move upon each knee. Dear God,
[30:54] we pray, Lord, even before the service
[30:56] is over. May they call in or say, "I was
[31:01] sick, but I'm well. I was burdened, but
[31:03] I've been released." Lord, we ask you
[31:05] for big things because we believe you're
[31:07] a big God.
[31:08] &gt;&gt; Lord, we pray that you would come one
[31:10] more time in these services. Dear God,
[31:12] as you've done this week, speak to the
[31:14] hearts of your people, Lord, and anoint
[31:16] our hearts to receive. Thank you, dear
[31:18] God, for this church and this labor and
[31:20] for all that they've done to minister to
[31:22] your bride. We ask your blessings upon
[31:24] them as we commit these things into your
[31:26] hands for your glory. Thank you, Father,
[31:28] once again for loving us in Jesus name.

[41:36] Thank you.
[41:40] That's my buddy. That's my buddy right

[41:42] while you getting ready to sing, Brother
[41:43] Bo, this young man right here, first

[41:58] And and for those of you, I I don't mean
[41:59] to make light of you not getting to sing
[42:01] because I I do want you all to sing. Uh
[42:04] but uh maybe maybe next year we can work
[42:06] in a song service or something.

[42:40] I'm going to sing rising up.
[42:44] &gt;&gt; And I don't believe it's to be rising
[42:46] up. I believe we are rising up.
[42:49] &gt;&gt; I like it on present tense. Don't you?
[42:51] Yes, sir.
[42:53] A sister in my church texted me and she
[42:56] said, "Brother Bo, would you please
[42:57] share this testimony at the meeting?"
[43:01] So,
[43:03] she was stricken with breast cancer
[43:06] and the doctor removed the surgeon
[43:09] removed the cancer and she went through
[43:12] six months of horror of chemotherapy.
[43:17] So, long story short, every year she
[43:20] goes for an MRI to see if it's returned.
[43:23] So, on July the 4th, Brother Andrew and
[43:26] Brother Josh Martin held a prayer line
[43:29] in our church and she got in it and she
[43:31] went for the MRI on July the 7th and
[43:35] everything come out clean.
[43:38] &gt;&gt; She said, "Maybe this could help
[43:40] someone."
[43:43] &gt;&gt; Oh, I still believe in prayer lines,
[43:45] don't you?
[43:47] [Music]
[43:50] As I look out across the land, I see

[48:54] [Music]
[48:57] Okay.
[48:58] &gt;&gt; How nice have to be in the house with
[48:59] the Lord this morning?
[49:00] &gt;&gt; I know. I sure am.
[49:02] I'm I'm trying to be real good. Usually
[49:04] I my people get on me. You talk too
[49:06] much. So I'm I'm trying to hold it in
[49:08] there. Hold. But I will say one of my
[49:10] brothers told me, he's like, "Man, Sam,
[49:12] the only reason you got a teaching is
[49:14] you got a captive audience. They can't
[49:15] get away." So that's that's true story.
[49:18] So
[49:19] the word, I mean, I'm just thrilled to
[49:21] be here in the house of the Lord with
[49:22] you all and thrilled to play the Lord
[49:23] together with you. I tried actually not
[49:25] to sing this song, but it it kept coming
[49:27] back in different ways. So, I thought,
[49:28] well, I guess we'll we'll try it again
[49:30] here. And we're in Bflat. This is this
[49:31] is about the bride and who we are. And I
[49:34] think that's one thing we've heard over
[49:35] and over again this weekend. Uh it's who
[49:36] we are. Faith, it's who we are. Healing,
[49:39] it's who we are. Praise is who we are
[49:41] because it's who our father is.
[49:43] &gt;&gt; We're our father's children. Anyway,
[49:44] anyway, don't give it. This is a war
[49:46] song.
[49:49] It's not for peace.
[49:52] It's a song of violence.
[49:54] Out in the streets,
[49:57] rulers of darkness,
[50:00] they're rising up. This bride is here to
[50:04] meet them.
[50:06] Our time is come
[50:08] and this bride is speaking.
[50:12] Words of the sun.
[50:14] Revelation's power.
[50:17] Soul of our tongue.
[50:20] And this world is fine.
[50:23] And I feel it sweet
[50:26] down in my hands,
[50:29] down in my feet.
[50:32] Let it burn, let it roll. Now this war
[50:36] won't rage on. I won't give in. I won't
[50:39] let go. Until the breaking of the dark
[50:43] sword of sphere, this sh
[50:46] these weapons I've got. I'm on the front
[50:49] lines, marching forward. I am a child of
[50:53] God and I'm marching.
[50:59] I'm marching home.
[51:05] Children sorrow.
[51:08] I hear them we
[51:10] lost in the darkness
[51:14] looking for peace.
[51:16] Set me on fire.
[51:19] Just let me turn
[51:22] until the whole world sees
[51:24] children's hearts are turned.
[51:27] Your bleed inside
[51:30] your broken heart and broke my chains.
[51:35] Shout out my tongue
[51:38] from my source of strength to my source
[51:42] of hope.
[51:44] The Jesus Christ of great warrior I
[51:47] know.
[51:50] Let it burn. Let it roll. Let him for
[51:54] age. I won't let go. I won't give in
[51:58] till I'm breaking of the dark sword of
[52:01] fear. The shield of faith
[52:04] weapons I've got. I'm on the front line
[52:08] marching forward. I held it and I'm
[52:12] marching.

[53:19] [Music]
[53:28] Their
[53:31] [Music]
[53:40] heads were low.
[53:44] Their steps were slow.
[53:49] As they walked along that long may road,
[53:56] then a man appeared.
[54:00] And as he drew near,
[54:04] he said, "Why are you so sad?
[54:09] Are things really that bad?"
[54:14] They said, "Sir,
[54:17] have you not heard?
[54:19] [Music]
[54:22] You must be a stranger in this town.
[54:29] For the one who came
[54:32] in the father's name,
[54:38] he has been cut down. They laid his body
[54:42] in the ground.
[54:45] As they walked and talked, he began to
[54:48] explain about this Jesus and why he
[54:52] came. He opened the scriptures and began
[54:55] to teach. The preacher of preachers, he
[54:59] began to preach.
[55:02] In the wilderness, the children had
[55:05] nothing there to eat. With mana from
[55:07] heaven fell down at their feet, but they
[55:10] were dry and thirsty. In a foreign lamb,
[55:14] living water came forth. Out of a rock
[55:16] in the sand, when the three Hebrew
[55:19] children were thrown in the flames, a
[55:22] fourth man appeared, nominus,
[55:28] [Music]
[55:31] to say,
[55:35] it was me. Oh,
[55:38] it was me.
[55:43] I am the one who back there on Calvary.
[55:50] It was me.
[55:56] [Music]
[56:05] Who do you think hung the stars in the
[56:08] sky? Who do you think made the day and
[56:11] the night? Who made the flowers? Who
[56:15] made the trees? Who made the sun and the
[56:18] moon in the seas? Who gives life to all
[56:22] who believe? Who do you think made the
[56:26] blind to see? And who made the very air
[56:30] that you breathe? Who defeated death and
[56:33] won the victory.
[56:36] It was me.
[56:39] Oh, it was me.
[56:44] I am the one who died for you on
[56:48] Calvary.
[56:51] It was me.
[57:06] Who do you think was the voice in the
[57:09] tree? Who do you think told the prophet
[57:12] to speak? Who created worlds and paint
[57:16] the storms to cease? And who drove
[57:18] Hady's voice right down to their knees?
[57:21] Tell me, who do you think brought you
[57:23] here today? Who's coming back to take
[57:27] your road someday? And who left his
[57:29] throne to fellowship with you, to make
[57:33] himself known to me of you?
[57:37] It was me.
[57:39] [Music]
[57:40] Oh, it's me.
[57:45] I am the one you left back there on
[57:49] Calvary.
[57:52] It was me.
[57:56] [Music]
[58:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord.
[58:07] &gt;&gt; It was me.
[58:12] [Applause]
[58:24] Praise the Lord.

[59:25] him
[59:26] and I know I'll ever be the same.

[1:00:41] Amen. Do you love him?

[1:17:07] presence of the Lord just fell and and

[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; He promised he would be with us. You may
[1:17:28] be going through something this morning.
[1:17:30] You don't see a way out. But he said
[1:17:32] where there is no way, he'd make a way.

[1:21:04] that will grow in his great name a chunk
[1:21:08] of wood that seems to put
[1:21:11] it out.
[1:21:14] And God has put it in our life.
[1:21:19] Though it seems we won't survive. That
[1:21:22] our flame may grow in his might.

[1:28:29] us this morning. Now let's approach him.
[1:28:31] Heavenly Father, Lord, as we gather here

[1:28:38] opportunity that we get in your presence
[1:28:40] and to be with believers of like
[1:28:42] precious faith. And Lord, to fellowship
[1:28:45] around the revealed word of this hour,
[1:28:47] it's always a blessing, Lord. It's
[1:28:49] always a privilege. And Lord, it seems
[1:28:51] as if we plan a long time for these
[1:28:53] moments and look forward to them. And
[1:28:55] then Lord, so quickly they go by. And
[1:28:58] Lord, I'm so thankful this morning that
[1:29:00] there's a great eternal meeting coming.
[1:29:03] Lord, where time will not hinder it.

[1:29:52] would be fed. Lord, may the power of God
[1:29:55] move among us this morning in a special
[1:29:57] way. Lord, I bind the hand of Satan. I

[1:30:01] that he would try to come into these
[1:30:03] meetings. Satan, you are defeated in the
[1:30:05] name of Jesus this morning. Now Lord, if
[1:30:08] there be anyone here with their needs
[1:30:10] unmet, I pray this morning, God, you
[1:30:12] would help me, Lord, to get myself out
[1:30:14] of the way, that you could come and you
[1:30:15] could speak to hearts and lives, that
[1:30:17] you could you could transform lives here
[1:30:20] this morning by the preaching of your
[1:30:22] word. Now, Father, we surrender into thy
[1:30:24] faithful hands, have your way among us,
[1:30:26] forgive us of our failures, forgive us
[1:30:28] of our shortcomings, and draw us closer

[1:31:25] message. And amen, he's g us give his
[1:31:27] heart to study it. We we say God bless
[1:31:29] you. May the Lord use you in a special
[1:31:31] way. Amen. The book of numbers the 16th
[1:31:34] chapter and then the third verse of
[1:31:37] number 16. The Bible here says and they
[1:31:41] gathered themselves together against
[1:31:43] Moses and against Aaron. Now that's two
[1:31:46] people you don't want to gather yourself
[1:31:48] against.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; and said unto them, Ye too much upon
[1:31:52] you, seeing all the congregation are
[1:31:54] holy. Every one of them, and the Lord is
[1:31:57] among them. Now, wherefore then lift you
[1:32:00] up yourselves above the congregation of
[1:32:03] the Lord? How many knows that was false
[1:32:04] accusations?
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; You lift yourself up above the
[1:32:08] congregations of the Lord. Now, watch
[1:32:10] watch what an effect this had.
[1:32:13] And when Moses heard it, he fell upon
[1:32:16] his face. When Moses heard these
[1:32:19] accusations, it so it done something to
[1:32:22] him that he just fell upon his face. Now
[1:32:25] also want to go in the New Testament in
[1:32:27] the book of Ephesians the fourth
[1:32:28] chapter.
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; The book of Ephesians the fourth
[1:32:31] chapter. I have been studying and
[1:32:33] praying for these meetings and had other
[1:32:35] things on my heart and this morning just
[1:32:37] what I was going to preach. The
[1:32:39] inspiration left me and uh the Lord just
[1:32:41] settled this on my heart and amen I I
[1:32:44] struggled with it and wrestled with it
[1:32:45] and I finally told him I said Lord you
[1:32:47] know best. I'll surrender to you. And
[1:32:49] amen. Ephesians chapter 4. Those of you
[1:32:52] all from the church there at home you
[1:32:53] have to forgive me. You've heard this
[1:32:55] before, but Amen. then just help me the
[1:32:56] same. Amen. Ephesians chapter 4 and
[1:33:00] verse number 17. Paul here writing, he
[1:33:03] says, "This I say therefore and testify
[1:33:06] in the Lord that ye henceforth walk not
[1:33:09] as other Gentiles walk in the vanity of
[1:33:12] their mind, having the understanding
[1:33:15] darkened, being alienated from the life
[1:33:17] of God through the ignorance that is in
[1:33:19] them." Now watch this. because of the
[1:33:22] blindness of their heart. Who being, now
[1:33:25] look what he says, who being past
[1:33:27] feeling have given themselves over unto
[1:33:30] lasciviousness to work all uncleanness
[1:33:33] with greediness. But ye have not so
[1:33:36] learned Christ. If so be that ye have
[1:33:39] heard of him, how many's heard of him?
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. and have been taught by him as the
[1:33:44] truth is in Jesus that you put off
[1:33:47] concerning the former conversation of
[1:33:49] the old man
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; which is corrupt according to the
[1:33:52] deceitful lust. Now watch what he says.
[1:33:55] And be renewed in the spirit of your
[1:33:58] mind.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Be renewed in the spirit of your
[1:34:01] mind and that ye put on the new man
[1:34:04] which after God is created in
[1:34:06] righteousness and true holiness. We're
[1:34:09] for putting away lying, speaking every
[1:34:12] man truth with his neighbor. Wouldn't
[1:34:14] that Wouldn't that just fix a lot of
[1:34:16] problems?
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Speaking truth with his neighbor,
[1:34:19] for we are members one of another.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. We ask the Lord this morning to
[1:34:25] bless the reading of his word. As you
[1:34:26] can have your seat here this morning, I
[1:34:28] I want to uh just to take a few moments
[1:34:31] here and if I would if I would title
[1:34:33] this today, I want to speak to you on
[1:34:35] this. Lose not the feeling of and for
[1:34:38] the people. Lose not the feeling of and
[1:34:42] for the people. You know, after a
[1:34:44] meeting like this, I can I wonder with a
[1:34:46] show of hands how many can testify
[1:34:48] you've got a fresh feeling. Amen.
[1:34:50] There's just a a freshness over your
[1:34:52] heart. There's a freshness over your
[1:34:54] mind. I'll say this. The devil will do
[1:34:57] everything he can, amen, to see that
[1:34:59] that fresh feeling does not remain,
[1:35:02] Amen. in your heart and in your spirit
[1:35:04] and in your home and in your churches
[1:35:06] and in your family. Amen. The devil will
[1:35:08] do everything he can to see, amen, that
[1:35:11] what has become fresh will become stale.
[1:35:14] Now, amen. I believe that if we've, how
[1:35:16] many's had an experience with God here
[1:35:17] this weekend? I believe if we've had an
[1:35:20] experience with God, Amen. then we must
[1:35:23] feed that experience. And the prophet of
[1:35:25] God would say, "Eagles only live meat."
[1:35:27] Amen. They're vulture. They don't eat a
[1:35:29] carrying like the vulture. He said, "But
[1:35:31] a real eagle kills his own meat. He has
[1:35:34] to have it fresh." Amen. Amen. Like the
[1:35:36] grizzly bear and the black bear is a
[1:35:38] scavenger. He eats carryon. But the
[1:35:40] grizzly bear, he has to kill fresh
[1:35:42] night. Amen. Or when he's going to eat,
[1:35:45] he eats. Brother Ram said, "And so is
[1:35:46] the eagle." He said, "An eagle gets
[1:35:49] fresh meat. He don't want anything
[1:35:51] that's stale or anything that's left
[1:35:53] over or handme-downs." Amen. He wants to
[1:35:56] get his own meat. Amen. Amen. I think
[1:35:59] it's a powerful thing that the prophet
[1:36:01] of God, amen, does not liken us to stale
[1:36:04] Christians, amen, or animals that can
[1:36:07] live on stale experiences, amen, but
[1:36:10] rather he likens us unto eagles, amen,
[1:36:12] that have to live on the freshness of
[1:36:14] the word of God. You know, as the as the
[1:36:16] Lord just inspired this thought to my
[1:36:18] heart some time ago, I was listening to
[1:36:20] this tape and brother said, "An
[1:36:22] unchangeable God." He said, "What we
[1:36:24] want is born again Christians." Amen.
[1:36:26] with salvation in their heart and the
[1:36:28] power of the Holy Ghost in there. Amen.
[1:36:31] To love one another and and to stretch
[1:36:33] out. Now listen, and to have feelings
[1:36:35] for one another. Amen. Glorious
[1:36:38] feelings, hopes of feelings. Amen. And
[1:36:40] brotherly affections that binds us
[1:36:42] together. Amen. That's what God wants us
[1:36:46] to have. Amen. I don't know about you,
[1:36:48] but when I hear a prophet tell us
[1:36:50] something, Amen. that God wants us to
[1:36:52] have, Amen. It ignites something in my
[1:36:55] heart. Amen. To pursue the thing that
[1:36:58] God is desiring us to have. And I love
[1:37:01] what the prophet of God said. He said,
[1:37:02] "That's what we need today." Amen. Is a
[1:37:04] church that we wouldn't be ashamed for
[1:37:06] anyone to come into. Amen. It is
[1:37:09] perfectly governed by the Holy Spirit.
[1:37:11] There is no fanaticism. There is no
[1:37:14] starchy. Amen. It's just a good warm
[1:37:16] church and it's filled with God's
[1:37:18] spirit. Amen. Watch that good solid
[1:37:20] gospel teaching pastor. Amen. That's
[1:37:23] what we have need. Amen. and God help us
[1:37:26] to have it. Amen. God wants us to have
[1:37:29] it. Now, amen. You all have to agree
[1:37:30] with me that there's a big difference in
[1:37:32] what we want and what God wants. Amen.
[1:37:34] Amen. I know some that want a formal
[1:37:36] church and a starchy church and amen, a
[1:37:39] fundamental church. And I know some that
[1:37:41] want a fanatical church and a amen. But
[1:37:44] I don't want what they want and I don't
[1:37:45] want what I want. Amen. But rather, I
[1:37:48] want what God wants. And and the prophet
[1:37:50] of God said, "God wants us to have
[1:37:52] faith." Amen. Amen. Unbelief won't
[1:37:54] destroy his plans. I I know the devil
[1:37:57] wants us to have unbelief. Amen. The
[1:37:59] devil wants us to have doubt, but God,
[1:38:02] Amen, wants us to have faith. And And I,
[1:38:04] as I begin to think upon this, I I begin
[1:38:06] to realize that you all, you all know we
[1:38:08] preach a lot against feelings. Amen.
[1:38:10] Amen. We preach a lot against serving
[1:38:12] God by feelings. And Amen. being led by
[1:38:15] feelings. And Amen. judging our
[1:38:17] experience by feelings. Amen. But I want
[1:38:19] to show you something. Amen. We're not
[1:38:22] preaching against having feelings
[1:38:23] though. Amen. We're preaching against
[1:38:25] the leadership of the soul. Amen. Being
[1:38:28] the sense of feeling. But we are not
[1:38:30] preaching against the sense of feeling.
[1:38:33] Amen. Being in the soul towards one
[1:38:35] another. Amen. I find it amazing that it
[1:38:37] is important. Amen. To have feelings.
[1:38:40] Brother Bram's down there in Mexico.
[1:38:42] Amen. And there's an older man come up
[1:38:43] in the prayer line. Remember? Amen. He
[1:38:45] didn't have no shoes on. Amen. His hat
[1:38:48] was torn off. His clothes was ragged. He
[1:38:50] said, "I put my arm around him." He
[1:38:52] said, "He was somebody's daddy. He was
[1:38:54] almost naked." Maybe, amen. And worked
[1:38:56] many days to raise some little child. He
[1:38:59] said he was blind. Amen. I tried to give
[1:39:01] him my suit or I tried to give him my
[1:39:03] shoes. He said, "I realized nothing I
[1:39:05] had would fit him." He said, "Now I put
[1:39:07] my arm around him and I thought, poor
[1:39:09] old fella." He said, "You know, you have
[1:39:11] to enter into the suffering of the
[1:39:14] person." Amen. To have feelings for
[1:39:16] them. If it ever, now listen to a
[1:39:18] prophet. If it ever gets to a place that
[1:39:21] I cannot feel sorry for the sick, Amen.
[1:39:24] then it's time for me to leave the
[1:39:26] platform. Amen. And quit praying for
[1:39:28] them. He didn't say if it ever gets to
[1:39:30] the time that I can't preach Isaiah 55
[1:39:33] or 53 like anybody else. Or if I can't
[1:39:36] if I can't preach a good sermon on
[1:39:38] divine healing, amen, like anybody else.
[1:39:41] He said, "If it ever gets to the place
[1:39:43] that I cannot enter into the feeling,
[1:39:46] Amen, it's time for me to leave the pull
[1:39:48] pit." He said, "It's when I get to a
[1:39:50] place that I cannot feel the burden of
[1:39:52] sin on the people. Then it's time for me
[1:39:54] to get away from here because I could
[1:39:57] never do no good for God. It's the
[1:40:00] feeling you have to have for the
[1:40:02] people." You know, it's a love that you
[1:40:05] can project to the people that they know
[1:40:07] you love them and they love you and you
[1:40:10] can feel it. Amen. And there's something
[1:40:13] that happens then. See, and when I was
[1:40:15] praying for the old fella, he said a
[1:40:17] vision came and he had his head laying
[1:40:20] over on my shoulder and he was patting
[1:40:22] me when I was praying. Now listen, he
[1:40:24] could not understand what I was saying
[1:40:27] because he could not speak English.
[1:40:29] Amen. I want y'all to get this. He could
[1:40:31] not understand, Amen. the words of the
[1:40:34] prayer, but he could feel the feeling
[1:40:37] that was behind the prayer. He could not
[1:40:39] understand what a prophet was saying,
[1:40:41] but he could feel the feeling that was
[1:40:43] behind what he was saying. And I say
[1:40:45] this morning, oh God, give us a church.
[1:40:48] And if somebody comes in and they don't
[1:40:50] know who Brother Brandham is, and they
[1:40:52] don't know what the seventh seal is, and
[1:40:54] they don't know what the third bull is,
[1:40:56] they can hear a preacher preaching and
[1:40:58] say, "I may not understand what he's
[1:40:59] talking about, but there's some feeling
[1:41:01] behind what he's saying. There's some
[1:41:03] enthusiasm behind what he's preaching
[1:41:06] because he's not there, amen, for his
[1:41:08] own reputation. He's not there for his
[1:41:10] own kingdom. He's there that the power
[1:41:13] of God might come into the church of God
[1:41:15] and move in power and authority. Hey, I
[1:41:18] believe it. I believe it's time, amen,
[1:41:20] to quit trying to get all our all our
[1:41:22] educations right and Amen. Get all our
[1:41:24] cliches right. Amen. And get some
[1:41:26] feeling back in our preaching. Amen. Get
[1:41:28] some feeling back in our singing. Get
[1:41:30] some feeling back in our Amen.
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. I say this, behind
[1:41:35] everything, there's a spirit. And the
[1:41:37] prophet of God said the church was put
[1:41:39] here for a purpose. He said there's a
[1:41:41] spirit behind this church. He said
[1:41:43] there's a spirit behind your home. He
[1:41:46] said behind everything there's a spirit,
[1:41:48] a motive and an objective. Behind
[1:41:51] everything there is a spirit there's a
[1:41:54] motive and an objective. Amen. He said
[1:41:57] see the church comes here amen to to
[1:42:00] exalt some human system or something
[1:42:02] then its motives is not right. But if
[1:42:05] it's put here, amen, to try to achieve
[1:42:08] something for the kingdom of God, then
[1:42:11] the motive and the objective, amen, is
[1:42:13] right. If the motives is directed that
[1:42:16] way, amen. I want to say this, amen,
[1:42:19] behind every ministry, there is a
[1:42:21] spirit, there is a motive, and there is
[1:42:24] an objective. And I know we got a lot of
[1:42:26] young men setting out, amen, to preach
[1:42:28] this message. Amen. I tell you what you
[1:42:30] need before you need an iPad and before
[1:42:33] you need a MacBook and before you need a
[1:42:35] computer and before you need a new suit,
[1:42:37] you need the right spirit and the right
[1:42:39] motive and the right objective. Amen. It
[1:42:42] ain't about who can out preach who and
[1:42:44] who can out quote who. It's about who,
[1:42:46] Amen. can lose themselves in the
[1:42:49] presence of God and become a vessel that
[1:42:51] the Holy Ghost can move into and bless
[1:42:54] somebody through.
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. It's brother Mson. Can't you
[1:42:57] see America? Amen. has fell for the
[1:42:59] glamour and the goddess. Amen. It's paid
[1:43:02] the devil in the realm of flesh. Amen.
[1:43:04] Making a way for the devil to present
[1:43:07] himself. He said, "I hope you understand
[1:43:09] this. Stay clear from it. I don't care
[1:43:11] how many DDs and PhDs or whatever is
[1:43:16] behind it. It's a lie." Amen. Brother,
[1:43:19] don't leave no room for the devil,
[1:43:20] folks. He said, "See, we're prone, Amen,
[1:43:23] to go after the gift." Amen. Instead of
[1:43:26] the giver. He said when you see signs
[1:43:28] and wonders take place, Amen. Don't you
[1:43:30] notice the sign so much? Amen. But look
[1:43:34] at what's behind it. Amen. It's still
[1:43:37] small voice that speaks. He said that's
[1:43:39] the reason that we can't have revivals
[1:43:42] in America is because people go after
[1:43:44] gifts instead of the giver. Amen. Now,
[1:43:48] brother said many people are following
[1:43:50] signs. It isn't the sign. Amen. It's the
[1:43:53] voice that is with the sign. Amen. Man
[1:43:56] has gifts and things. Amen. But watch
[1:43:59] what's behind it. Amen. Satan can
[1:44:02] impersonate anything. He can
[1:44:04] impersonate. But what kind of voice,
[1:44:06] Amen, is behind the sign. He said, "Oh,
[1:44:09] take a person walk up." Amen. Big what
[1:44:12] they can do and all this thing. Amen.
[1:44:14] Don't you pay no attention to that.
[1:44:17] Amen. God's spirit is a meek spirit.
[1:44:20] It's a humble spirit. It's full of love
[1:44:23] and compassion. And it's looking to all
[1:44:26] people. Amen. Bringing all people to a
[1:44:29] knowledge of Christ. Amen. I'll just say
[1:44:32] this. Amen. We don't just want to do
[1:44:34] something. Amen. We want there to be
[1:44:36] something behind what we're doing.
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; Can you agree? Amen. We don't just want
[1:44:41] to have meetings. Amen. Let there be
[1:44:44] something behind the meetings. Amen. We
[1:44:46] don't just want to sing songs. Amen. Let
[1:44:48] there be something behind the songs.
[1:44:50] Amen. We don't want to just preach
[1:44:51] sermons. Amen. Let there be something
[1:44:54] behind the sermon. Oh, God. Amen. We
[1:44:56] don't just want to, Amen. just have
[1:44:58] youth meetings. Let there be something
[1:45:00] behind it. The prophet of God said,
[1:45:02] "Amen. There's nothing in a man or woman
[1:45:04] that can be desired." Amen. It's what's
[1:45:07] in behind there. Amen. There's nothing
[1:45:10] in Andrew Glover that any of you all
[1:45:12] should desire in my flesh, but it's
[1:45:14] what's behind the flesh. Amen. There's
[1:45:17] nothing in Brother Daryl or Brother
[1:45:18] Windler or Brother Josh or any other
[1:45:20] preacher that we should desire, amen, in
[1:45:23] the flesh. But there should be something
[1:45:25] behind the flesh that everyone ought to
[1:45:28] be desiring. And it shouldn't be the way
[1:45:30] they talk or the way they sing. It ought
[1:45:32] to be the way they project the love of
[1:45:34] God as an instrument in the hand of God.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll say it. I'll say this. Amen.
[1:45:40] We put our eyes on the wrong things,
[1:45:42] folks. We put our goals on the wrong
[1:45:44] things. And we've left off somewhere
[1:45:46] that it ain't about who's who. It's
[1:45:48] about who's here. It ain't about I'm
[1:45:50] here or you're here. It's about Jesus
[1:45:52] Christ. The son of God is right here in
[1:45:55] this building this morning to help the
[1:45:57] needs of his people.
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; I don't care what he used to be. Now,
[1:46:01] come on. Amen. Amen. I just got to say
[1:46:03] it. Amen. Amen. Some people get the
[1:46:05] greatest blessings from preachers and
[1:46:07] they don't have a clue what their
[1:46:08] background was. Amen. But can I tell you
[1:46:10] why? Because it's not what they used to
[1:46:13] be. It's what's behind there now. Amen.
[1:46:16] The skin blinds the people. He said, "I
[1:46:18] remember that woman used to be this or
[1:46:20] that man used to be that." He said, "The
[1:46:23] skins that was once on the badger, but
[1:46:25] it's now hiding the glory of God. It's
[1:46:28] got God housed behind it. It was an old
[1:46:32] animal. It was an old animal, but now it
[1:46:36] is housing the glory of God. And so, can
[1:46:39] your skin be changed?" Amen. to be made
[1:46:42] a housing place for God. Listen, God
[1:46:45] dwelling in humility. Somebody say, "Why
[1:46:47] aren't you arrogant?" I tell you why I'm
[1:46:49] not arrogant. Amen. Is because I know
[1:46:51] where I come from and I know where I
[1:46:54] should have been. And I know the grace
[1:46:56] of God chose this old patch of skin.
[1:46:58] Amen. To transform me by the water and
[1:47:01] the blood and the spirit. This ain't
[1:47:03] about Andrew Glover's kid. It ain't
[1:47:05] about any other preacher's kid. It's
[1:47:07] about the revelation that the glory of
[1:47:10] God has come into the flesh of his
[1:47:12] people. Come on. Amen. Amen. Quit
[1:47:14] letting the devil talk you out of the
[1:47:15] testimony. Quit letting the devil talk
[1:47:17] you out. Amen. Of being what God's
[1:47:19] called you to be because one time you
[1:47:21] was a drunk. One time you was this and
[1:47:24] one time you was that. I know what I
[1:47:26] used to be. Amen. But I ain't what I
[1:47:28] used to be. And thank God there's a
[1:47:30] grace that can transform me into what
[1:47:33] God ordained me to be.
[1:47:35] Yes, sir. Amen. I'm talking about the
[1:47:38] power of God restoring the feeling of
[1:47:40] God in the church of God.
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll just go ahead and get it out
[1:47:44] there. Amen. People will never care how
[1:47:46] much you know until they know how much
[1:47:49] you care.
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; Well, we might as well preach.
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; People will never care how much you know
[1:47:57] until they know how much you care. Amen.
[1:47:59] I I'm going to borrow something from
[1:48:01] brother Daryl. He told me one time when
[1:48:02] I I just started out preaching. He we
[1:48:04] were discussing something. He told me he
[1:48:06] said, "But Andrew," he said, "here was a
[1:48:07] brother preaching and he went and
[1:48:08] preached a meeting and I followed him
[1:48:10] the next weekend and he said, "I knew
[1:48:12] the brother, knew how he preached and he
[1:48:14] said, I went in there and I said, man,
[1:48:15] y'all probably had a good meeting cuz
[1:48:17] brother so and so was here last weekend
[1:48:19] and they looked, Brother Daryl, remember
[1:48:20] that?" They looked at Brother Daryl and
[1:48:22] they said, "Well, brother, he done a
[1:48:23] really good job, but we didn't
[1:48:25] understand anything he was saying."
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; You realize that guy today ain't even
[1:48:29] serving God.
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; He's out in the world somewhere. Amen.
[1:48:33] Because it's not about how much you
[1:48:34] know, it's about how much do you care.
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; Jude said, "Some have compassion and
[1:48:42] they make a difference." Brother Ram
[1:48:44] said, "Look, people don't know what
[1:48:46] compassion is." He said, "Compassion and
[1:48:48] love is the will of God." And you can
[1:48:51] only exercise that as God gives it. It's
[1:48:55] not human emotional passion. It's not
[1:48:58] emotional love, but it's divine love,
[1:49:01] which can only be rendered and given by
[1:49:04] God. So, if a man ain't met God, he
[1:49:07] don't know what to give God's people.
[1:49:09] But if he's met God, he's become a
[1:49:11] channel of communication between God and
[1:49:14] his people to deliver the things of God
[1:49:17] to their heart. Amen. I'll say this
[1:49:18] there. There's a big difference in human
[1:49:21] compassion, folks. Amen. And divine
[1:49:23] compassion. The prophet of God said,
[1:49:25] "Real divine compassion is to do the
[1:49:28] will of him that sent you to do it."
[1:49:31] Now, let me just ask you this. Amen. Who
[1:49:33] sent you to do what you're doing?
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; Who sent you to do what you're doing?
[1:49:38] Amen. Who sent you into this age to
[1:49:41] overcome the god of this evil age? I'll
[1:49:43] tell you who sent you was the Lord Jesus
[1:49:46] Christ. Reverend said the people are so
[1:49:48] bound. Amen. They don't understand
[1:49:50] heavenly things. He said we don't see.
[1:49:53] Amen. Compassion is to do the will of
[1:49:57] God.
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; Compassion is to do the will of God.
[1:50:01] Now, how many will agree that Jesus was
[1:50:03] a God man? Amen. Amen. He was a God man,
[1:50:05] right? He was God. Amen.
[1:50:07] &gt;&gt; Brother said this, he was a man full of
[1:50:11] the compassion of God. Ain't that
[1:50:13] something? Amen. In John chapter 5,
[1:50:15] Jesus, he walks by the pool of Bethesda
[1:50:18] and there's multitudes of sick there,
[1:50:20] but he goes by the lame and the hauled
[1:50:23] and the withered and the blind and he
[1:50:24] goes to a little man who's had a
[1:50:26] trouble. Brotherson, could have been a
[1:50:28] prostate trouble for about 38 years and
[1:50:31] he said, "Look what he done." Amen. He
[1:50:33] healed him and said, "Rise up and take
[1:50:36] your bed." And the others sat there. He
[1:50:39] said now back then they said the same
[1:50:41] thing they say now that God is not a
[1:50:43] loving God and God don't care said no he
[1:50:46] came to do one thing and that was the
[1:50:49] will of God for the people and then
[1:50:53] Jesus came for one purpose that was to
[1:50:55] do the will of God for the people of
[1:50:58] God. Oh can I say this to you this
[1:51:00] morning when I speak of this the people
[1:51:03] I want I want to say this to you I'm
[1:51:05] talking about you. I'm talking about the
[1:51:07] people of God. I want to say this. I
[1:51:10] don't think Amen. that you're just the
[1:51:12] you're just the Oh, God. Can I preach? I
[1:51:14] don't think you're just the just the
[1:51:16] outcast or just Amen. talk to you any
[1:51:18] kind of way and preach to you any kind
[1:51:20] Amen. I think you're very important
[1:51:22] people because my prophet said, Amen. If
[1:51:25] I had two drops of the literal blood of
[1:51:27] Jesus in a charger, he said, what would
[1:51:30] I do with it? He said, "But tonight I
[1:51:32] have before me in the sight of the
[1:51:34] Lord." Amen. A greater price than the
[1:51:37] two drops of the literal blood of our
[1:51:39] Lord. I have the purchase of his blood.
[1:51:43] His people that he gave his blood that
[1:51:46] his people might live. Brother said he
[1:51:48] could think more of the people than he
[1:51:51] did of his own life. He gave his life
[1:51:53] that his people could live. So, I hold
[1:51:56] this my audience tonight in the greatest
[1:51:58] respects because it's the purchase of
[1:52:01] the blood of the Lord. I'm just going to
[1:52:04] preach here for a second. Amen. I don't
[1:52:06] think that ought to just be for the
[1:52:07] preacher. Amen. Approaching the
[1:52:09] congregation. I think that ought to be
[1:52:11] for the congregation approaching the
[1:52:13] congregation beside them. That these are
[1:52:15] not just crazy people you go to church
[1:52:18] with. These are not just fanatics. These
[1:52:20] are not just people that are that are
[1:52:22] religious people. This is the purchase
[1:52:24] of the blood of Jesus Christ. This is
[1:52:27] the most powerful force of people on the
[1:52:29] face of the earth that you're sitting
[1:52:31] next to.
[1:52:33] &gt;&gt; Amen, man. He said, "How close I must be
[1:52:35] to tell you exactly the truth." Because
[1:52:38] God will make me answer for it at the
[1:52:40] day of judgment more than if I took the
[1:52:42] blood, the literal blood, and threw it
[1:52:45] on the ground. But Chris, he said it
[1:52:47] would be a greater penalty to mislead
[1:52:50] the people. the purchase of his blood
[1:52:53] than it would be to throw the blood from
[1:52:55] the charger that I had in it.
[1:52:58] &gt;&gt; God cares more about you knowing truth
[1:53:01] than he cared about his own blood being
[1:53:03] in a literal charger. There is a greater
[1:53:06] penalty to mislead a child of God than
[1:53:09] there is to pour the blood upon the
[1:53:10] ground. Oh, I'll say this. We ought to
[1:53:13] take recompense this morning and say,
[1:53:15] "Dear God, Amen. Don't ever let me get
[1:53:17] so cold. Don't ever let me get so hard
[1:53:20] that I can't recognize that I'm not
[1:53:22] talking to just another piece of
[1:53:24] humanity. I'm talking, amen, to the
[1:53:26] queen of heaven itself.
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; In this age we're living, you Amen.
[1:53:33] Y'all forgive me. I'm I'm under a
[1:53:34] burden. I'm just preaching this morning.
[1:53:36] In this age we're living in. Amen. It's
[1:53:38] easy to lose the feeling. It's easy to
[1:53:41] lose the feeling for the people. It's
[1:53:44] easy to lose the feeling of the people.
[1:53:46] But I want to say this morning, amen, we
[1:53:48] must fight, amen, to keep the feeling.
[1:53:51] We must fight, amen, to keep the
[1:53:54] channels open. We must fight, amen, to
[1:53:57] stay in constant fellowship.
[1:53:59] &gt;&gt; Y'all know I'm telling the truth because
[1:54:02] the devil's doing everything he can to
[1:54:04] make it a stale church and a starchy
[1:54:07] church and a fanatical church and a cold
[1:54:10] church. But I want to tell that devil
[1:54:11] this morning, he has had his way long
[1:54:14] enough. This is not just another people
[1:54:16] and I'm not just another preacher. We
[1:54:18] are the bride of Jesus Christ and we
[1:54:21] refuse to let the devil steal from us
[1:54:24] what God gave us. If he gave you the
[1:54:26] Holy Ghost, you ought to fight to keep
[1:54:28] the freshness of the Holy Ghost. If he
[1:54:31] gave you victory over sin, you ought to
[1:54:33] fight to keep the victory over sin. If
[1:54:35] he gave you joy in the place of sorrow,
[1:54:38] you ought to fight to keep the joy. If
[1:54:40] he gave you peace in the place of
[1:54:42] confusion, you ought to lay down and let
[1:54:45] the devil take your peace. You ought to
[1:54:47] draw your sword as a son of God, as a
[1:54:50] daughter of God, and fight back against
[1:54:52] the thief.
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. God done too much in these
[1:54:56] meetings to just let it be another
[1:54:58] meeting on the books.
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; God done too much. Amen. I might as well
[1:55:02] preach out here. God's done too much in
[1:55:05] your churches. He's done too much in
[1:55:07] your lives. He's done too much in your
[1:55:09] families. He's done too much in your
[1:55:11] ministry just to become another
[1:55:12] statistic on a church roster somewhere.
[1:55:15] I say fight for the freshness of the
[1:55:17] Holy Ghost. I say fight for the liberty
[1:55:20] of the power of God in the church.
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; It ain't worth weighing down. It's worth
[1:55:27] fighting for.
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; It ain't worth weighing down.
[1:55:31] [Applause]
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; It ain't worth just walking away and
[1:55:34] say, "Well, I went through the prayer
[1:55:35] line and I felt good last night and I
[1:55:37] feel worse this morning." Get up, Job,
[1:55:39] and fight for your healing.
[1:55:42] &gt;&gt; Well, I went through the prayer line
[1:55:43] last night and they laid their hands on
[1:55:45] me and I I felt the presence of God. I
[1:55:48] wish I could feel it again. You can, but
[1:55:50] you got to fight for it because the
[1:55:52] devil is doing everything he can that
[1:55:54] you cannot feel what God wants you to
[1:55:57] feel.
[1:56:00] &gt;&gt; Stands there in 1963 and preaches what I
[1:56:03] believe is a key sermon in the ministry
[1:56:05] of the seventh angel. And he calls it
[1:56:08] standing in the gap.
[1:56:11] &gt;&gt; But what he does is I'm going to show
[1:56:12] you how that Moses and Jesus and Paul.
[1:56:16] Now he don't say this, but he says it,
[1:56:17] brother Kobe, and myself all had
[1:56:20] ministries of standing in the gap.
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; Now I don't want to get too far out
[1:56:26] there in this, but I want to say the
[1:56:28] bride has a ministry.
[1:56:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; And it's a ministry of standing in the
[1:56:32] gap.
[1:56:33] &gt;&gt; Can I tell you what it is? It's the gap
[1:56:36] between the Leodysian age and the
[1:56:38] rapture of the church, which is what we
[1:56:40] call the bride age. And the devil's done
[1:56:43] everything he can, amen, to take that
[1:56:46] away from the church because he knows
[1:56:48] where the mercy seat is in this hour.
[1:56:51] Brother said the mercy seat is in the
[1:56:53] heart of the bride. So, Brother Bam
[1:56:56] shows you that standing in the gap is
[1:56:58] not something that is easy to do. I
[1:57:01] actually took time and looked up, Amen.
[1:57:03] the the phrase standing in the gap. You
[1:57:05] know what it is? It's an idiom most
[1:57:07] often used in a religious context, which
[1:57:10] is meaning to intercede for someone.
[1:57:12] Amen. Often in prayer by taking on their
[1:57:16] burden. Amen. So, you got burdens.
[1:57:18] Brother Allen and I got burdens. Brother
[1:57:20] David, you got burdens. And brother
[1:57:22] Stewart, you got burdens. And Amen. I
[1:57:24] don't, brother Ben. I'm just going to
[1:57:25] preach if that's okay. Amen. This whole
[1:57:27] entire congregation of word of life has
[1:57:30] burdens. Amen. But can I tell you
[1:57:31] something else? Ben Puit has burdens and
[1:57:34] he has burdens for his family has
[1:57:36] burdens for his life. Amen. But as a
[1:57:38] pastor, he is standing in the gap and he
[1:57:41] can't just bear his burdens and sister
[1:57:43] Britney's burdens and his baby's
[1:57:45] burdens, but he's got to bear your
[1:57:47] burdens. And it's real easy when you're
[1:57:49] bearing another person's burden.
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; Come on,
[1:57:53] &gt;&gt; to get wore out. Now you all know what
[1:57:56] I'm talking about. Fathers,
[1:58:00] &gt;&gt; bearing burdens.
[1:58:01] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm not saying I'm not saying Ben's
[1:58:03] wore out. No, I know you just turned 40,
[1:58:05] buddy.
[1:58:06] &gt;&gt; But but but you got to realize this is
[1:58:09] not just playing church.
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; See, when you're bearing bird and you're
[1:58:14] acting, now listen to this. You're
[1:58:16] acting as a protective force on their
[1:58:19] behalf. It signifies a person who sees
[1:58:22] judgment coming. But brother Kenny, they
[1:58:25] step in to advert the judgment that's
[1:58:27] coming. It means to intercede for those
[1:58:30] in danger or plead for repentance. Now
[1:58:34] that phrase standing in the gap
[1:58:36] originated in Ezekiel 22:30 when the
[1:58:38] Bible says, "I sought for a man among
[1:58:40] them that should make up the hedge and
[1:58:43] stand in the gap before me for the land
[1:58:46] that I should not destroy it, but I
[1:58:48] found none." You realize that chapter
[1:58:51] closes by asking who will stand in the
[1:58:54] gap? Amen. To intercede for Jerusalem.
[1:58:57] Amen. Highlighting the abn the absence
[1:59:00] of anyone willing to take a stand
[1:59:02] against the prevailing wickedness. I
[1:59:05] want to say this and I want to say it
[1:59:07] with everything within me. If you got a
[1:59:09] pastor, a man of God who's got a
[1:59:11] backbone and not a panty waist and is
[1:59:14] willing to stand in the gap for your
[1:59:16] family and stand in the gap for your
[1:59:18] babies, you ought to stand behind that
[1:59:20] man. He's not just there to preach you a
[1:59:22] sermon. He's a protective force between
[1:59:25] you and the judgment that's on its way
[1:59:27] to your house.
[1:59:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Stand in the gap. I'll say it.
[1:59:33] Amen. And and and and you all forgive
[1:59:34] me. Amen. Amen. But I God, I just picked
[1:59:36] it up. I think we ought to get past the
[1:59:38] days of second-guessing everything the
[1:59:40] man of God says. I think we ought to get
[1:59:43] past the days of having the preacher for
[1:59:45] lunch on the way to the restaurant on
[1:59:47] Sunday. I think we ought to get past the
[1:59:49] days and say, "God, I don't want to lose
[1:59:51] the feeling of God. I don't want to lose
[1:59:53] the one who you placed to stand in the
[1:59:56] gap."
[1:59:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Stand in the gap, in my opinion,
[2:00:00] is probably one of the most transparent
[2:00:02] messages that we have of a prophet on
[2:00:05] tape. Come on, folks. He didn't run
[2:00:07] somewhere and hide when he was going
[2:00:09] through his problem. He come to a
[2:00:11] pullpit
[2:00:13] &gt;&gt; and he stood on a platform and recorded
[2:00:16] his problem and sent it around the
[2:00:19] world.
[2:00:22] &gt;&gt; Now, now what he said is, I think if it
[2:00:24] is this okay,
[2:00:26] &gt;&gt; he said, I think if it be the will of
[2:00:28] God, I would like to kindly brief you on
[2:00:30] things that's happened. And he goes to
[2:00:32] number 16 and he begins to show how that
[2:00:35] David and Kora has interfered with the
[2:00:38] commission of Moses. Now what he was
[2:00:40] showing them is God was going to kill
[2:00:42] them and he was going to start a whole
[2:00:44] new generation unless someone stood in
[2:00:47] the gap. Remember said if God was going
[2:00:49] to liquidate the church, the people and
[2:00:52] there was a time when God had gotten
[2:00:54] tired of fooling with our sin. We
[2:00:56] constantly going wrong. Who would stand
[2:00:59] like Moses for the people? Amen. Moses
[2:01:02] was not standing for himself, church. He
[2:01:05] was standing for the people.
[2:01:08] &gt;&gt; He said, "Now Moses in act was in every
[2:01:11] way substituting. He was a type of Jesus
[2:01:14] Christ." Now, can I tell you what Jesus
[2:01:17] Christ was? He was our burdenbearer.
[2:01:20] Let's take it a step higher than just
[2:01:22] brother Ben bearing his burdens in the
[2:01:24] churches. Let's go up to the savior of
[2:01:26] mankind. When he knelt there in the
[2:01:28] garden, brother Josh and he prayed and
[2:01:31] he said, "Father, if it be thy will, let
[2:01:33] this cup pass from me." Brother said,
[2:01:35] "The entire burden of the world was
[2:01:38] resting upon those shoulders." He said,
[2:01:41] "And today, he took our sins to
[2:01:43] Calvary." Come on. We didn't have to go
[2:01:45] to Calvary. He went there for us. He
[2:01:47] took our sins to Calvary. You know what
[2:01:50] else he done? He took them to hell.
[2:01:52] Hallelujah. He took our sins to Calvary
[2:01:55] and then he took him to hell so we don't
[2:01:57] have to go there. And God raised him up
[2:01:59] on the third day for a propitiation of
[2:02:02] our sins. And today he is the only
[2:02:05] mediator between God and man. He said if
[2:02:08] the love of God ever strikes your heart
[2:02:10] in the tenderness of Jesus Christ, you
[2:02:12] would be so in love with him that the
[2:02:14] world would be dead as your sin. That's
[2:02:17] how you know you have the Holy Spirit.
[2:02:19] Not because you can scream, not because
[2:02:21] you can shout, not because you can speak
[2:02:24] in tongues, but when sin becomes dead
[2:02:27] and you become alive in Jesus Christ. Oh
[2:02:30] love of God, how rich.
[2:02:34] [Applause]
[2:02:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, the love of God. Amen. Oh, the love
[2:02:39] of God. How rich. Thank you, buddy. How
[2:02:42] poor. How rich. Sorry, it's not poor.
[2:02:46] How rich the blood of God. How rich the
[2:02:49] promises of God. Oh, love of God. How
[2:02:52] rich and how pure. Amen. I think about
[2:02:56] how we're living in Revelation 3 in the
[2:02:58] Leodysian church age. You know what this
[2:03:00] age is? It's poor.
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; It's miserable. It's wretched. It's
[2:03:05] naked and blind. Re said, "Here's the
[2:03:07] worst part about it and don't know it."
[2:03:10] &gt;&gt; He said, "Now, if a man was in this
[2:03:12] condition and you could tell him his
[2:03:13] condition, he would try to help himself
[2:03:16] if he was mentally right. But when he's
[2:03:18] in that condition and you can't tell him
[2:03:20] any different, he just don't believe
[2:03:22] he's naked. He don't believe he's in
[2:03:24] that shape, then it shows here that he
[2:03:27] is blind. Now watch a prophet. He said,
[2:03:29] "Now I'm preaching to myself." Now, can
[2:03:32] I just preach this morning?
[2:03:34] &gt;&gt; He said, "I'm preaching to myself. Could
[2:03:36] we stand and see a human being that's
[2:03:38] blind, physically blind, and know that
[2:03:41] he's walking over a cliff?" And he said,
[2:03:43] "Could we in our stall state of mind
[2:03:47] that we're in this morning, could we
[2:03:50] stand and see a blind man walk over a
[2:03:52] cliff and not try to warn him?" It would
[2:03:55] be there would be so cruel. We would be
[2:03:57] so indifferent in our heart. Could you
[2:03:59] imagine a person getting so indifferent
[2:04:01] that he can almost laugh and see a blind
[2:04:04] man that cannot see, that cannot help
[2:04:07] himself, and deliberately let him walk
[2:04:09] over a cliff. He said that would be a
[2:04:11] bad thing to do. Amen. Nothing about it.
[2:04:15] Amen. Now, can I say something to you?
[2:04:17] Amen. A stall state of mind is a very
[2:04:20] dangerous place to get to. Amen. When
[2:04:22] you get a stall state of mind, look what
[2:04:24] a stall state of mind refers to. It's a
[2:04:27] mental or emotional state where someone
[2:04:30] feels stuck. Amen. They're unable to
[2:04:32] move forward or make progress towards
[2:04:35] their goals. It's a feeling of being in
[2:04:37] a rut where motivation and creativity
[2:04:41] and productivity are hindered. So when
[2:04:43] someone gets in a stall state of mind,
[2:04:46] amen, they didn't get there by
[2:04:48] themselves. Amen. But something happened
[2:04:50] to them and it put them in that
[2:04:52] condition and they lose their ability to
[2:04:54] move forward. Amen. Can I preach to you?
[2:04:57] Because I've seen it. I've seen people
[2:04:59] go through things. Amen. and get in a
[2:05:01] stall state of mind and waste 5 years
[2:05:03] and 10 years and 20 years of their life.
[2:05:06] Amen. Because of something that
[2:05:08] happened, Amen. 5 years ago and 10 years
[2:05:10] ago. But can I tell you what it's time
[2:05:12] to do? It's time to let it go and get
[2:05:15] the creativity and the progression of
[2:05:17] the Holy Ghost back in your home.
[2:05:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. I've seen I've seen preachers go
[2:05:23] through things. Amen. And for five and
[2:05:25] 10 years, they live in this rut and and
[2:05:27] everything's negative and everything's
[2:05:29] bad and everything's poor pitiful. But
[2:05:31] somewhere or another, you've got to
[2:05:33] realize this is more than about you.
[2:05:35] It's more than about me. It's about a
[2:05:37] people. And God has called us to be
[2:05:39] preachers. Amen. And I say this, I
[2:05:41] salute every one of these men of God
[2:05:43] because they've come to the pullpit and
[2:05:45] they preached healing to you when they
[2:05:47] were bleeding. They preached healing to
[2:05:49] you and the power of God to fix things
[2:05:51] when they were broken. I say, "Oh God,
[2:05:54] let it move out of the poop pits and let
[2:05:56] it move into the pews that we can back
[2:05:58] the word of God even when we're hurting.
[2:06:01] We can back the word of God even when
[2:06:03] we're bleeding on the inside because
[2:06:05] there's a feeling of divine compassion
[2:06:08] that is moved into our souls.
[2:06:10] [Applause]
[2:06:12] &gt;&gt; Stall state of mind.
[2:06:14] &gt;&gt; It's a dangerous place, brother Ben.
[2:06:16] It's a dangerous place for a father to
[2:06:18] get." Amen. Hear me this morning. Amen.
[2:06:21] And it ain't just going to affect you.
[2:06:22] It'll affect that wife. It'll affect
[2:06:24] them babies. It'll affect them grandb
[2:06:26] babies. It'll affect generations
[2:06:28] somewhere or another. You've got to get
[2:06:30] in the presence of God. And let the
[2:06:32] power of God shake you out of that
[2:06:34] spiritual amnesia and remind you who you
[2:06:37] are.
[2:06:38] &gt;&gt; You're not a defeated person. You're a
[2:06:41] son of God. You're a daughter of God.
[2:06:43] Yeah, there was a mistake. Yeah, there
[2:06:45] was a failure. But if you forgot there's
[2:06:47] a blood. And if there's a blood, then
[2:06:50] there's a chance for a second chance.
[2:06:54] &gt;&gt; Get up. Get up in Jesus name. Get up out
[2:06:57] of that stall state of mind.
[2:07:03] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. You got somewhere to go.
[2:07:06] &gt;&gt; Come on. You got somewhere to go. Your
[2:07:08] name is on the lamb's book of life.
[2:07:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:12] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm just going to preach. That's
[2:07:14] okay. Your name is on the lamb's book of
[2:07:16] life. And according to the prophet I
[2:07:18] study, there's nothing you can do to
[2:07:21] take your name off the lamb's book of
[2:07:23] life.
[2:07:26] &gt;&gt; Preach it now.
[2:07:28] &gt;&gt; A stall state of mind. Now, I know I
[2:07:31] know when people get in stall states of
[2:07:32] mind cuz church attendance gets
[2:07:34] &gt;&gt; stalled.
[2:07:37] &gt;&gt; I may never be asked to close a meeting
[2:07:39] again after this, but I'm going to
[2:07:40] preach what's on my heart.
[2:07:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise gets stalled.
[2:07:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Enthusiasm gets stalled. Watch a
[2:07:47] prophet of God. He said, "Now, I'm going
[2:07:49] to make a confession to you." My I'm
[2:07:51] going to read this to you. Well, my
[2:07:52] brethren world over, I want to make this
[2:07:55] confession. I humbly say it. That just
[2:07:57] been what I was doing or fixing to do. I
[2:08:00] had been preaching for years and I
[2:08:02] become an old man and an old veteran
[2:08:04] preacher and I had a lot of hard battles
[2:08:06] and maybe I'm scarred. I'm all cut up on
[2:08:09] the inside from fights. Now listen to
[2:08:11] this. Because my lot the Lord gave me
[2:08:14] was not to kiss the babies and to marry
[2:08:17] the young and to bury the old, but it
[2:08:20] was to hold a twohanded sword at the
[2:08:24] battlefront. Amen. Against the ws of
[2:08:27] paganism and demonology and the powers
[2:08:30] of darkness and fight it with the word
[2:08:32] of God till I can see the enemy
[2:08:34] defeated. Listen, he says, I've been cut
[2:08:37] deep many times.
[2:08:40] &gt;&gt; Oh God. Amen. Here's a prophet. He's not
[2:08:43] in sin. He's not running women. He's not
[2:08:46] gambling at the casino. Amen. He's not
[2:08:48] down at the bar. Amen. He's in the pull
[2:08:50] pit and he's doing what God called him
[2:08:53] to do. He's doing what God anointed him
[2:08:55] to do and he gets hurt and he gets cut.
[2:08:58] Amen. I'm just going to preach my heart
[2:09:00] to you this morning. Amen. He said,
[2:09:01] "Listen," and I thought this, "If this
[2:09:04] people that call themselves Christians,
[2:09:06] if they don't want to listen to the
[2:09:08] message and I'm preaching, then let them
[2:09:10] alone. I'll just stop it all together
[2:09:12] and I'll go up into the mountains.
[2:09:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, that's what a a preacher
[2:09:16] said. Amen. But I tell you what,
[2:09:18] sometimes we say, "Amen. Well, if this
[2:09:20] is the way it's going to be, I'll just
[2:09:22] stay home. If this is the way it's going
[2:09:23] to be, if there ain't no love in the
[2:09:25] church, huh, I'll just go home." Amen.
[2:09:27] Well, why don't you put some love in the
[2:09:29] church?
[2:09:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why don't you change the
[2:09:32] situation? If you're so spiritual, I
[2:09:35] guess it's the evangelist coming out. If
[2:09:37] you're so spiritual, Amen. Why don't you
[2:09:39] change the atmosphere? If you're an
[2:09:41] amateur god and you're a messiah and
[2:09:43] you're a creator, amen, then exercise
[2:09:45] your authority to do more than speak
[2:09:47] cancer out of existence, but use it to
[2:09:49] change the atmosphere in your home and
[2:09:52] in your churches.
[2:09:54] &gt;&gt; Come on, folks. Amen. It's time to quit
[2:09:56] just letting every excuse take us out of
[2:09:58] the house of God and back us in a corner
[2:10:01] in a stalled state of mind. It's time to
[2:10:03] shake ourselves and remember who we are
[2:10:06] and remember why we're here.
[2:10:08] Yes, sir.
[2:10:09] &gt;&gt; We ain't here for just a shout
[2:10:11] hallelujah time and a picnic. We're here
[2:10:13] to defeat demons. We're here to get
[2:10:15] blood on our sword. We're here to
[2:10:16] overcome 200,000,000
[2:10:18] demons that have released themselves
[2:10:20] from the river Euphrates.
[2:10:24] &gt;&gt; But I'll just go be a hunter and I'll
[2:10:27] just go be a trapper and I'll just go be
[2:10:29] a woodsman and I'll just go fish. You
[2:10:32] know what the prophet of God called
[2:10:33] that? He called that a selfish attitude.
[2:10:36] Yeah. Yeah.
[2:10:38] &gt;&gt; Woo. God have mercy.
[2:10:41] &gt;&gt; A selfish attitude.
[2:10:42] &gt;&gt; Now, that was a preacher. But what about
[2:10:44] our selfish attitude?
[2:10:48] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:10:48] &gt;&gt; Preacher, preach a little correction on
[2:10:50] Sunday morning. I'll show him. I won't
[2:10:52] show up on Sunday night. And if I do
[2:10:54] show up next Sunday, I'll sit on him.
[2:10:55] Well, bless God, honey. You're going to
[2:10:57] be in for a bumpy ride because you ain't
[2:10:59] going to stop what God has ordained. You
[2:11:01] ain't going to find what the Holy Ghost
[2:11:03] has put his seal of approval upon. This
[2:11:06] ain't just a church. This ain't just a
[2:11:08] people. This is the purchase of the
[2:11:10] blood of Jesus Christ. And all the
[2:11:13] authority that was in that blood is in
[2:11:15] every member who is underneath that
[2:11:17] blood.
[2:11:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I tell you this
[2:11:22] morning, folks, it's time to say, Lord,
[2:11:24] Amen. I don't want my ways. I want your
[2:11:26] ways. Amen. I don't want my thoughts
[2:11:29] because your thoughts are higher than my
[2:11:31] thoughts.
[2:11:33] &gt;&gt; Now, I might as well just get it out
[2:11:35] there cuz there ain't a one of us
[2:11:36] sitting in this building that hadn't
[2:11:37] battled a selfish attitude.
[2:11:41] &gt;&gt; Somewhere,
[2:11:45] &gt;&gt; brother David, just me and you, buddy.
[2:11:46] Amen.
[2:11:48] &gt;&gt; Brother Harvey, me and you, buddy.
[2:11:50] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:11:51] &gt;&gt; God bless you, sis.
[2:11:53] Come on with
[2:11:58] &gt;&gt; everyone battling it.
[2:11:59] &gt;&gt; You know why? Because we care more about
[2:12:01] ourselves sometimes.
[2:12:04] &gt;&gt; But said, "Here I am. I'm just going to
[2:12:06] leave. I'm just going to I'm just going
[2:12:07] to go up in the mountains." Remember
[2:12:09] said, "Look," he said, "but I'm sitting
[2:12:10] in a restaurant." And he said, "While
[2:12:12] I'm sitting there," he said, "I made up
[2:12:14] my mind. I'm running out of time." He
[2:12:16] said, "I made up my mind." He said, "I I
[2:12:18] was just going to go be a real man. You
[2:12:20] know, I was just going to go up in the
[2:12:21] mountains. I was going to hunt. I was
[2:12:23] going to fish. I was going to trap. He
[2:12:25] said, "And I was just going to be done
[2:12:26] with all this." He said, "And I went in
[2:12:28] there and here come a big woodsman."
[2:12:30] Now, amen. Can I tell you the dangerous
[2:12:32] thing about getting in a stall state of
[2:12:34] mind is the devil will put things in
[2:12:36] front of you to interpret what you can
[2:12:38] be if you remain in that condition. And
[2:12:41] the devil forgets that he don't have the
[2:12:44] power to bring to pass the false
[2:12:46] interpretation of your life he's trying
[2:12:48] to hand you.
[2:12:51] He handed brother Brandham a woodsman
[2:12:53] and he come remember he said he come in
[2:12:55] there at brother Chris he let out a big
[2:12:57] sneeze and he said it was not a little
[2:12:59] shoe it was a big coui and he said I
[2:13:02] looked at Billy Paul and I said that's a
[2:13:04] real man he said that's the man I'll be
[2:13:07] he said that's what I and listen what he
[2:13:09] says he says that's what I'll be in the
[2:13:11] future but here's the problem he did not
[2:13:14] have the power to control his future
[2:13:17] because Jesus Christ is every believer's
[2:13:20] future.
[2:13:22] &gt;&gt; He said, "That's what I'll be." He said,
[2:13:24] "But then the Lord," Now, I'm telling
[2:13:25] y'all something. The Lord begin to deal
[2:13:27] with him and I can raise my hand and
[2:13:30] say, "Thank God. After I've had my
[2:13:32] selfish attitudes and I've had my
[2:13:34] agendas and my plans and what I'll be
[2:13:36] and where I'll go and what I'll do and
[2:13:38] how I'll quit preaching and how I'll
[2:13:40] just be this, then all of a sudden the
[2:13:42] Lord begins to deal with my heart and
[2:13:44] the Lord begins to show me, boy, you
[2:13:47] don't have the power to bring to pass
[2:13:48] what you think you do. But you got to
[2:13:50] surrender to me. Hallelujah. You got to
[2:13:54] surrender to me because I'm the only one
[2:13:56] who has the power to control your
[2:13:59] future.
[2:14:01] If you try to control it, Brilliant
[2:14:03] Brandon, here's what you're going to be.
[2:14:04] You're going to be like your
[2:14:05] brother-in-law, Fletcher Roy, without
[2:14:08] his wife and a drunk without enough
[2:14:10] money to buy a cup of coffee.
[2:14:17] &gt;&gt; I'll carry out your plans. He said,
[2:14:19] "Carry out your plans and you'll be like
[2:14:22] that."
[2:14:25] &gt;&gt; I'm going to go ahead and tell you.
[2:14:26] Amen. carry out your plans and you'll be
[2:14:29] like every wretched, miserable, blind,
[2:14:30] naked, lay out of sin.
[2:14:34] &gt;&gt; But there was a seed inside of him and
[2:14:36] he said, "Lord, I don't want to be like
[2:14:39] that. I don't want to be like that. I
[2:14:42] want to be something different. I told
[2:14:44] you you called me to be a prophet. I
[2:14:46] want to live in the wilderness like a
[2:14:47] prophet." But now listen. But I was
[2:14:49] using my own excuse so I could hunt.
[2:14:54] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[2:14:55] see my own good.
[2:14:58] &gt;&gt; I don't want to preach. I I don't want
[2:14:59] to be up here holding the sword. I'm
[2:15:01] tired of getting deep cuts. I'm tired of
[2:15:04] praying. I'm tired of getting wore out
[2:15:06] and you preach against sin and you go
[2:15:08] back the next year and there's more
[2:15:09] makeup on the faces and there's more
[2:15:11] pits on the women and there's more cut
[2:15:13] hair. I don't want to do it no more,
[2:15:15] God. You preach against this and preach
[2:15:17] against that and they make fun of you. I
[2:15:19] just want to go be a prophet and come
[2:15:21] out in television and go back in the
[2:15:23] woods. But William Brandom, that was not
[2:15:25] what you was born to be.
[2:15:28] &gt;&gt; And bride of Jesus Christ, you was not
[2:15:30] born to be a casual lukewarm half-living
[2:15:34] Christian. You were not born to be a
[2:15:36] Leodysa. You were born to be a son of
[2:15:39] God, but daughter of God with dominion
[2:15:42] over every devil.
[2:15:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:15:50] &gt;&gt; And then he gets in that spot.
[2:15:51] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And the Lord comes by
[2:15:53] &gt;&gt; and the Lord shows him how he got here.
[2:15:55] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:15:56] &gt;&gt; You know how he got here? You forgot the
[2:15:59] feeling.
[2:16:01] &gt;&gt; I know I'm sweating. Let me
[2:16:04] &gt;&gt; Kenny, let me wipe my eyes.
[2:16:06] &gt;&gt; Go ahead.
[2:16:07] &gt;&gt; You forgot the feeling of your people.
[2:16:10] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[2:16:11] &gt;&gt; Am I reading that right?
[2:16:13] &gt;&gt; You forgot the call
[2:16:15] &gt;&gt; that I called you to. Uh-huh.
[2:16:19] &gt;&gt; You forgot that I'm your alpha.
[2:16:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:16:22] &gt;&gt; And I'm your omega.
[2:16:24] &gt;&gt; You forgot I'm the one that saved you.
[2:16:27] You forgot I'm the one that started you.
[2:16:29] You forgot I'm the one that gave you the
[2:16:31] Holy Ghost. You forgot I'm the one that
[2:16:33] gave you that wife. You're the one. You
[2:16:35] forgot I'm the one that gave you them
[2:16:37] babies. You forgot I'm the one that gave
[2:16:39] you that ministry because you got hurt.
[2:16:43] Now
[2:16:44] &gt;&gt; I'm this I'm I'm this far into it. I
[2:16:47] might as well go on.
[2:16:48] &gt;&gt; And because of the hurt, he said, I
[2:16:51] begin to build a complex.
[2:16:54] &gt;&gt; Now watch what he said. I let the sick
[2:16:56] lay. I want the the same man that
[2:17:00] brought Georgia Carter out of the bed by
[2:17:02] the power of God. The same man that
[2:17:04] brought Upshaw out of the wheelchair
[2:17:06] after 66 years by the power of God said,
[2:17:09] "I let the sick lay. I want the Lord to
[2:17:12] tell me where to go and not to. I built
[2:17:14] myself a complex because the people
[2:17:18] didn't hear my message. And God forbid
[2:17:21] that I'll try to compare my life of now
[2:17:24] like Moses. But it's exactly
[2:17:27] [Music]
[2:17:29] &gt;&gt; what Moses did.
[2:17:31] &gt;&gt; The people wouldn't listen to him when
[2:17:33] he come to deliver them. So he just left
[2:17:35] him alone and went in the wilderness.
[2:17:37] But he God turned him around.
[2:17:41] Let me put my shouting shoes on. When he
[2:17:44] forgot the needs and when he got so hurt
[2:17:46] that he just turned to walk away. Sorry,
[2:17:49] Joe. Amen. I got to quit doing that. And
[2:17:51] God turned him around.
[2:17:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, God. I tell you why I'm shouting is
[2:17:57] cuz this is a house full of people that
[2:17:59] we've ever been. We've everyone been
[2:18:00] there and we've ever been on our way and
[2:18:02] doing our own thing. But it's been God
[2:18:04] who is rich in mercy. Brother, brother,
[2:18:06] brother, brother, brother, sister,
[2:18:08] sister, sister. But God, rich in mercy,
[2:18:11] come down with his mighty hand. And he
[2:18:14] turned us around and he said, "Forget
[2:18:16] the hurts and forget the cuts and forget
[2:18:19] the complexes and forget the false
[2:18:21] accusations and forget the game sayings
[2:18:23] and remember I am the Lord and I called
[2:18:26] you and I predestinated you and I
[2:18:29] ordained you, Esther,
[2:18:31] &gt;&gt; for a time such as this."
[2:18:36] &gt;&gt; That's right. I'm going to go ahead and
[2:18:38] bust that devil square in the face.
[2:18:41] &gt;&gt; That okay, Roth.
[2:18:44] &gt;&gt; Sincere people
[2:18:46] &gt;&gt; can get hurt.
[2:18:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:18:48] &gt;&gt; And make mistakes.
[2:18:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:51] &gt;&gt; Brother said, "I want to bring this to
[2:18:53] you so that you would see and show you
[2:18:56] the mistake a man can make." Yet being
[2:18:58] sincere. See, Moses lost the feeling of
[2:19:02] his people
[2:19:03] &gt;&gt; because they wouldn't listen to him.
[2:19:05] &gt;&gt; True. Now folks, I'm studying this and
[2:19:07] I'm sitting in my office doing more
[2:19:08] praying than I am studying.
[2:19:11] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[2:19:12] &gt;&gt; I'm saying Lord, how many times I'm just
[2:19:16] preaching
[2:19:18] &gt;&gt; have we got the spot and said, "Well,
[2:19:19] bless God. If they won't hear me, I'll
[2:19:21] just preach it anyhow."
[2:19:24] &gt;&gt; Do you do you realize that's losing the
[2:19:26] feeling?
[2:19:28] &gt;&gt; Now,
[2:19:31] &gt;&gt; Brother Roy, you see your dream? I
[2:19:33] cannot go with a ministry like that
[2:19:35] until I feel different in my heart about
[2:19:36] it. No. Now, now folks,
[2:19:39] &gt;&gt; no matter if God did tell me there's got
[2:19:43] to be a change. I want to tell you this
[2:19:45] weekend, there's been a change.
[2:19:48] &gt;&gt; I want to tell you this weekend, I want
[2:19:50] to tell you that prayer line last night,
[2:19:52] it was not just another prayer line.
[2:19:54] Some of you all couldn't even get in the
[2:19:56] prayer line because you got about right
[2:19:57] here and the anointing like to swept you
[2:20:00] off your feet. You know why? Because it
[2:20:02] was not just another prayer line. It was
[2:20:04] not just another time you were going to
[2:20:06] walk through the former preachers. It
[2:20:08] was a change. It was a revealing. It was
[2:20:11] a refreshing. It was a renewing. It was
[2:20:13] a revival in your soul to pull you out
[2:20:16] of the complex, to pull you out of the
[2:20:18] situation. And remember who put you
[2:20:21] where you are.
[2:20:23] [Applause]
[2:20:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:20:27] &gt;&gt; I'm going to say it as plain as I know
[2:20:28] how. If a man starts you, a man can stop
[2:20:31] you.
[2:20:33] &gt;&gt; But if God starts you, it'll take God to
[2:20:36] stop you.
[2:20:39] &gt;&gt; Well, I've had him tell me, "Do this and
[2:20:41] do that and you're finished." Well,
[2:20:42] listen here. You didn't start me, so you
[2:20:45] can't finish me. But my Bible says, "He
[2:20:48] is my alpha, and he is my omega, and he
[2:20:51] is my beginning, and he is my ending.
[2:20:54] And you may have a destination for me,
[2:20:56] but he has an expected end.
[2:20:59] And you don't have the power to put
[2:21:01] another believer in their destination.
[2:21:04] It takes God to put them in their
[2:21:06] expected end.
[2:21:11] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm opening up my heart to you from
[2:21:13] a prophet of God.
[2:21:15] &gt;&gt; He said they ought heard my message. I
[2:21:17] don't have the feeling for the people I
[2:21:19] should. Until I get that feeling,
[2:21:21] there's no need in me going cuz I'd just
[2:21:24] be a hypocrite. Come on now.
[2:21:31] &gt;&gt; Miguel, I'm sweating bad, but am I
[2:21:33] reading this right?
[2:21:35] &gt;&gt; I be
[2:21:36] &gt;&gt; a hypocrite.
[2:21:38] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:21:38] &gt;&gt; Now I'm turning the corner. I'm going to
[2:21:40] preach here.
[2:21:41] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:21:41] &gt;&gt; All these years I've tried to serve him
[2:21:43] with a true heart. And I won't grare and
[2:21:46] be a hypocrite. Now watch. He said, "I
[2:21:48] got to feel it."
[2:21:50] &gt;&gt; He said, "I'm calling them Ricky's and
[2:21:52] Ricettas."
[2:21:54] &gt;&gt; Come on. Yeah,
[2:21:54] &gt;&gt; I'm going somewhere with this folks.
[2:21:57] &gt;&gt; I'm calling them this bunch.
[2:22:00] &gt;&gt; But it's God's children that's in
[2:22:02] bondage
[2:22:04] &gt;&gt; and I must go to them.
[2:22:06] [Applause]
[2:22:08] &gt;&gt; That's like somebody getting in jail and
[2:22:09] calling you to get them out and you
[2:22:10] making fun of them for being in jail.
[2:22:14] &gt;&gt; Well, maybe I ought to use a different
[2:22:15] illustration, Josh.
[2:22:18] &gt;&gt; Like somebody calling you from the
[2:22:19] hospital.
[2:22:21] &gt;&gt; I'm down here.
[2:22:25] I'm down here dying. Come see me. And
[2:22:27] you laugh at him.
[2:22:28] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:22:29] &gt;&gt; See, I till I can feel that way, I'll
[2:22:32] just woof around and preach some
[2:22:34] conventions and things, but I'll wait.
[2:22:37] &gt;&gt; Brother Brother Wendle, I love that.
[2:22:39] I'll wait. He didn't say I'll quit. He
[2:22:42] said, "I'll wait." You know why? Because
[2:22:44] he was a word prophet. And there was a
[2:22:46] revelation in his soul that they that
[2:22:49] wait upon the Lord. He shall renew their
[2:22:52] strength. They shall mount up with the
[2:22:55] wings like an eagle. They shall walk and
[2:22:57] not be weary. They shall run and not
[2:23:00] faint. Oh, blessed be the name of the
[2:23:03] Lord. This ain't just another church.
[2:23:05] This is some eagles who have been
[2:23:07] waiting on God and they've been renewed
[2:23:09] this weekend in the presence of God.
[2:23:12] Amen.
[2:23:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:23:16] &gt;&gt; I don't I'll say this. I'm just
[2:23:17] preaching. I don't want to be a
[2:23:19] hypocrite.
[2:23:21] &gt;&gt; We don't want to be hypocrites, folks.
[2:23:23] My Bible says a hypocrite with his
[2:23:25] mouth.
[2:23:28] &gt;&gt; Destroyth his neighbor.
[2:23:31] &gt;&gt; But through knowledge shall the just be
[2:23:35] delivered. Now
[2:23:36] &gt;&gt; come on.
[2:23:36] &gt;&gt; I got to say what brother said.
[2:23:38] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:23:38] &gt;&gt; He said, "God knows what's in your
[2:23:40] heart.
[2:23:44] And if you don't speak from your heart,
[2:23:50] &gt;&gt; it is
[2:23:52] &gt;&gt; we'll look at the cross and preach this
[2:23:53] one.
[2:23:54] &gt;&gt; Then you're a hypocrite.
[2:23:56] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[2:23:57] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:24:01] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:24:04] &gt;&gt; So someone comes to you and they ask you
[2:24:06] something wrong, something something
[2:24:07] between us, right? and you say, "Oh, no,
[2:24:09] no, everything's fine." And then you
[2:24:11] pick up the phone and call somebody and
[2:24:13] tell them what's between you and the
[2:24:14] person
[2:24:16] on it.
[2:24:17] &gt;&gt; That just come to you about the
[2:24:19] situation.
[2:24:23] &gt;&gt; I'm following the Lord.
[2:24:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:25] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm just I'm just meek and I'm
[2:24:27] just a I'm just I'm just a meek
[2:24:29] Christian. I just
[2:24:30] &gt;&gt; No, let's just call what brother calling
[2:24:32] a hypocrite. Amen.
[2:24:34] &gt;&gt; Jesus said to the Pharisees, "You
[2:24:36] hypocrites, how can you say these
[2:24:38] things?" Made them a hypocrite. They
[2:24:40] fought one thing in their heart and
[2:24:42] expressed their lips with something
[2:24:43] else. I'll just say what he said. A
[2:24:46] hypocrite is a deceiver.
[2:24:48] &gt;&gt; I just feel that someone's just not
[2:24:49] exactly honest with yourself. He said,
[2:24:51] "And if you won't be honest with
[2:24:52] yourself, then how can you ever be
[2:24:54] honest with God? How could you? If you
[2:24:57] in your own heart know that you're not
[2:24:59] living a joyful, peaceful life of the
[2:25:01] spirit, and you're yielded to the
[2:25:03] potter, everything just wonderful, God's
[2:25:05] on the scene, and you won't be honest
[2:25:07] enough with yourself to come and receive
[2:25:09] it. How could you be honest with God?
[2:25:13] &gt;&gt; Now, come on, folks. We might as well
[2:25:15] just have some Bible preaching here. How
[2:25:17] can you be honest with God whom you've
[2:25:19] not seen when you can't even be honest
[2:25:20] with your brother whom you see every
[2:25:22] day?
[2:25:23] &gt;&gt; My brother said, "See, Amen. I'm just
[2:25:25] going to say this. Regardless of the
[2:25:27] consequences, speak the truth.
[2:25:31] &gt;&gt; Brother said, "That's what we want is
[2:25:32] the truth. Regardless of where it hurts,
[2:25:34] where it circumcises, or who cuts it
[2:25:37] off, we want the truth." He said, "What
[2:25:40] we need is an old-fashioned God-scent
[2:25:42] heaven-born preachers who will tell the
[2:25:44] truth regardless of who it hurts. What
[2:25:47] we need is men of God who will stand and
[2:25:50] tell the truth regardless of who it
[2:25:52] hurts. If it takes deacons, trustees,
[2:25:55] and everything else out, you just be
[2:25:58] honest.
[2:26:01] &gt;&gt; But I'll just say this. Anything the
[2:26:02] truth takes out of the church ought to
[2:26:04] be taken out.
[2:26:07] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[2:26:08] &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus.
[2:26:10] &gt;&gt; Baby, I got that John the Baptist
[2:26:11] anointing on me this morning.
[2:26:13] &gt;&gt; Let it go.
[2:26:15] &gt;&gt; What are you saying, preacher? I'm
[2:26:16] saying I believe God's word to be the
[2:26:17] truth.
[2:26:18] &gt;&gt; And I don't know how popular it is. That
[2:26:20] don't make any difference how popular
[2:26:22] you become here. It's how popular are
[2:26:24] you up there.
[2:26:25] &gt;&gt; You know what Paul said? He said, "Speak
[2:26:27] the truth in love."
[2:26:31] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:26:32] &gt;&gt; Now, y'all know what I'm talking about.
[2:26:34] &gt;&gt; This I say therefore and testify in the
[2:26:36] Lord that you henceforth walk not as
[2:26:39] other Gentiles walk in the vanity of
[2:26:42] their mind. Now, I'm I'm here. Can I
[2:26:44] preach?
[2:26:45] &gt;&gt; You henceforth not walk like Leotans
[2:26:47] walk.
[2:26:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right. That's right.
[2:26:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:26:50] &gt;&gt; Just aimlessly.
[2:26:52] &gt;&gt; Look what he says. Having the
[2:26:54] understanding darkened.
[2:26:55] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:26:56] &gt;&gt; Now look at verse 19. Now this is this
[2:27:00] is this is in my spirit.
[2:27:03] Who being past feeling
[2:27:06] have given themselves over untoiousness
[2:27:09] to work all uncleanliness with
[2:27:11] greediness.
[2:27:13] &gt;&gt; You know what that word feeling means?
[2:27:15] &gt;&gt; It means to become callous.
[2:27:22] insensible
[2:27:24] &gt;&gt; to pain.
[2:27:25] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[2:27:26] &gt;&gt; You know what a prophet of God said?
[2:27:28] &gt;&gt; He said, "America has become
[2:27:30] &gt;&gt; callous."
[2:27:32] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[2:27:32] &gt;&gt; With an old intellectual idea.
[2:27:35] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[2:27:36] &gt;&gt; Now, I'll just say this because I find
[2:27:38] it amazing because I don't think our
[2:27:39] young people ought to just be in the
[2:27:41] church and just be passed by and looked
[2:27:43] at as, well, they're just babies.
[2:27:45] &gt;&gt; Come on in. In prayer lines, you and I'm
[2:27:48] and when I'm in a prayer line, you'll
[2:27:49] hear me pray over the young children.
[2:27:51] I'll say these words, "Lord, build a
[2:27:53] hedge of protection around them
[2:27:55] &gt;&gt; and keep them from the evils of the day.
[2:27:57] Fill every fiber of their being with the
[2:27:59] Holy Ghost and keep their hearts tender
[2:28:01] towards you."
[2:28:03] &gt;&gt; You know why? Because brother said, "You
[2:28:05] find a good streak of faith like that.
[2:28:06] That poor little boy a while ago
[2:28:08] standing here with his little legs
[2:28:09] walking like that. Little fella looked
[2:28:11] up at me, the tears come to his little
[2:28:12] eyes, kind of smiled like that." Why?
[2:28:15] The faith was just a moving. I know
[2:28:17] something had to take place. You see
[2:28:19] what happened? Sure you did. Satan knew
[2:28:22] he had to give away because that little
[2:28:24] child was a callous
[2:28:28] &gt;&gt; like many of the adults.
[2:28:32] &gt;&gt; You say, "What about them children?"
[2:28:34] Sure, Jesus is talking to their hearts.
[2:28:36] Sometimes the adults
[2:28:39] &gt;&gt; is so callous that the Holy Spirit just
[2:28:42] can't speak to them. Now, I'm going
[2:28:43] somewhere. God bless you. Sweet little
[2:28:45] curly-headed, bondheaded little girl
[2:28:47] sitting here with her little hand up,
[2:28:48] her little eyes watered, looking this
[2:28:50] way. You say, "God's not speaking to
[2:28:52] that child." He sure is.
[2:28:54] &gt;&gt; She hasn't calloused her heart with the
[2:28:57] things of the world yet. She's innocent.
[2:29:00] She's just a baby about six or seven
[2:29:02] years old. Here's another one. Look at
[2:29:03] that little fella coming down about 12
[2:29:05] years old. Shame on some of you old
[2:29:06] people. Now,
[2:29:08] &gt;&gt; I'm going to preach a second here. Your
[2:29:10] heart is callous and smutty and black.
[2:29:13] Statistics show that 98% of people are
[2:29:17] saved are saved before they're 21 years
[2:29:19] old.
[2:29:24] &gt;&gt; You get set in your ways,
[2:29:27] &gt;&gt; brother. That's
[2:29:30] &gt;&gt; all right.
[2:29:31] &gt;&gt; And you think you're right.
[2:29:36] &gt;&gt; Jesus,
[2:29:36] &gt;&gt; that is the truth.
[2:29:38] I've seen many times the callous saints
[2:29:40] come through prayer lines, men and women
[2:29:42] live godly and fail to be healed. When
[2:29:44] prostitutes on the street would come
[2:29:46] through and be healed instantly.
[2:29:48] &gt;&gt; He said, "See what's happened now?" Here
[2:29:50] it is. I'm I'm
[2:29:51] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:29:52] &gt;&gt; Y'all thought I was going to beat you.
[2:29:54] No, I'm going to preach to you.
[2:29:56] &gt;&gt; We've seen so many disappointments.
[2:29:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:00] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:30:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:30:02] &gt;&gt; And things that it's hard for our
[2:30:05] hearts.
[2:30:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[2:30:07] &gt;&gt; You all know I'm telling the truth this
[2:30:09] morning.
[2:30:10] &gt;&gt; And many times we put it through old
[2:30:12] truth story magazines and stuff of the
[2:30:14] world and it should have never been
[2:30:16] there.
[2:30:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:18] &gt;&gt; And it calloused it.
[2:30:21] &gt;&gt; Now I'll say this. Brother talked about
[2:30:23] a young girl. He said the Holy Spirit's
[2:30:25] deal with Y'all remember that. He said
[2:30:26] the Holy Spirit's dealing with you. He
[2:30:28] said tonight's your night. God's deal
[2:30:29] with your heart. And she'd come out of
[2:30:30] the meeting said don't you ever
[2:30:31] embarrass me like that. Two years later,
[2:30:34] Brother Bram comes back to the same town
[2:30:36] and he said, "I ran into her and she
[2:30:38] said these words. I could see my mom's
[2:30:40] soul frying hell like a pancake.
[2:30:44] &gt;&gt; And laugh at her."
[2:30:46] &gt;&gt; Now, that's said that's the danger of
[2:30:49] rejecting Jesus Christ.
[2:30:51] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:30:53] &gt;&gt; You get so hard and so calloused, you
[2:30:56] don't want nothing about it. And that's
[2:30:58] what this world is today. It's getting
[2:31:00] so callous. It don't want Christ. Now
[2:31:04] I'm bringing it out in the world in the
[2:31:05] church now. Is that okay?
[2:31:07] &gt;&gt; He said, "Now here's some of you women
[2:31:08] sitting here with short hair and don't
[2:31:10] have your hand up. What's the matter
[2:31:11] with you? You're wrong. See, don't try
[2:31:13] to meet God like that. You'll be
[2:31:15] condemned as certain as I'm standing in
[2:31:18] this pull pit. You mean the Pentecostal
[2:31:21] church has got in such a shape that it's
[2:31:24] got so callous till it's ashamed to
[2:31:26] admit it's wrong. Uh-huh.
[2:31:30] &gt;&gt; Well, we might as well not leave that
[2:31:31] out there. We might as well bring it
[2:31:33] right here. We've got to the same spot
[2:31:35] where you can show scriptures and you
[2:31:37] can show quotes and you can prove where
[2:31:39] this was wrong and it was just a
[2:31:40] misunderstanding or you misheard what I
[2:31:42] said. I pray to God we never get to the
[2:31:46] place that we can't say, "Lord, I'm
[2:31:47] wrong and your word is right." And for
[2:31:50] the sake of the atmosphere of the
[2:31:52] church, for the sake of brotherhood, for
[2:31:54] the sake of fellowship, Lord, I'm wrong
[2:31:56] and you're right. Amen.
[2:31:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said, "Oh, don't you lay
[2:32:01] your heart and become callous." Friends,
[2:32:03] Leoa is a callous age.
[2:32:06] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm just going to put on the on the
[2:32:08] preaching boots and preach a second
[2:32:09] because brother Brandham got callous,
[2:32:11] folks. He got hurt. He had been seen
[2:32:14] disappointments. But I got to thinking
[2:32:16] about this, brother. If there's a
[2:32:18] callous, brother Danny, there's got to
[2:32:20] be a remedy to heal it.
[2:32:22] &gt;&gt; So, you know what I did? I went looked
[2:32:25] up the scientific remedy, brother
[2:32:27] Miguel, to heal a callous. You know what
[2:32:29] they say, reduce the pressure and
[2:32:31] friction, soften the thickened skin, and
[2:32:34] protect the area from further
[2:32:36] irritation, and soak the callus in warm
[2:32:40] water. I said, "Oh, God, give me a pull
[2:32:42] pit. I can't wait to give that devil a
[2:32:44] black eye because if science has a way
[2:32:48] to heal a natural callous, my prophet
[2:32:51] has come in this hour with a spiritual
[2:32:53] way to heal a spiritual callous.
[2:32:57] &gt;&gt; I found it, brother Wendle. I found it.
[2:33:00] Amen. Let off the pressure and the
[2:33:02] friction and then soften the heart to
[2:33:04] receive the engrafted word which is able
[2:33:07] to save the soul and get behind the
[2:33:10] protection of the word and let the
[2:33:12] callous be washed in the water of the
[2:33:15] word of God.
[2:33:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, hear my heart this
[2:33:19] morning. You don't have to live
[2:33:21] calloused. You don't have to live hard.
[2:33:23] You don't have to live broken. You don't
[2:33:25] have to live without a feeling for God
[2:33:27] and a feeling for the church and a
[2:33:29] feeling for the people. There's a wider
[2:33:31] this morning. There's a place you can
[2:33:33] go.
[2:33:34] [Applause]
[2:33:37] &gt;&gt; The callous can be washed away.
[2:33:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:33:42] &gt;&gt; Lord, I'm following you this morning. So
[2:33:44] it is every callous church member falls
[2:33:46] beneath the cross and he rots to his or
[2:33:50] her own intellectual thinking. That's
[2:33:52] &gt;&gt; right. when new life comes out of that
[2:33:54] condition.
[2:33:56] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[2:33:58] &gt;&gt; Don't get mad at me.
[2:33:59] &gt;&gt; William Brandham had intellectual faking
[2:34:01] when he said, "I'll just go be a
[2:34:03] trapper.
[2:34:04] &gt;&gt; I'll just go be a hunter. I'll just go
[2:34:06] be a woodsman." But thank God
[2:34:08] &gt;&gt; that the intellectual thinking found the
[2:34:11] waters of the word and he was able to
[2:34:13] wash it and he said these words. He
[2:34:15] said, "New life comes out of that
[2:34:17] condition."
[2:34:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Give me some preaching
[2:34:20] room in the house of God. That's why the
[2:34:22] devil don't want you to get out of that
[2:34:24] condition because there's a testimony.
[2:34:27] Hallelujah. There's a testimony that's
[2:34:30] going to come out of that condition.
[2:34:31] There's a miracle going to come out of
[2:34:33] that condition. There's a breakthrough
[2:34:35] going to come out of that condition. And
[2:34:37] the devil presses and the devil presses
[2:34:39] and the devil presses. But I say this
[2:34:41] morning, we're going to press back.
[2:34:43] We're going to press back. We're going
[2:34:45] to press back against every coldness.
[2:34:47] We're going to press back against every
[2:34:48] cut. We're going to press back against
[2:34:50] every disappointment because we know if
[2:34:53] we just keep standing before long,
[2:34:55] Brother Josh, the sun is going to shine.
[2:34:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:35:01] &gt;&gt; God's going to write a testimony out of
[2:35:02] your hurt.
[2:35:04] &gt;&gt; I'm talking to you this morning. God is
[2:35:06] going to write a testimony out of your
[2:35:09] situation.
[2:35:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:35:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:35:16] powerful sir.
[2:35:18] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:35:18] &gt;&gt; God will take every callous off of you.
[2:35:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[2:35:23] &gt;&gt; If you just let him
[2:35:26] &gt;&gt; and make you tender
[2:35:28] &gt;&gt; and sweet
[2:35:29] &gt;&gt; and kind-hearted,
[2:35:31] loving,
[2:35:33] &gt;&gt; oh God.
[2:35:35] &gt;&gt; That's what I want.
[2:35:38] &gt;&gt; Forgiving one another.
[2:35:40] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:35:42] &gt;&gt; If you'll just have faith.
[2:35:45] &gt;&gt; That's right. Thank you, Lord.
[2:35:47] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going to say this.
[2:35:52] Complexes
[2:35:54] cause
[2:35:59] &gt;&gt; and calluses
[2:36:00] paralyze faith.
[2:36:06] &gt;&gt; Can I leave you with something?
[2:36:09] &gt;&gt; You know how people get calluses?
[2:36:12] &gt;&gt; By the regular routine.
[2:36:14] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[2:36:17] &gt;&gt; Heard brother Donnie say one time he
[2:36:19] said you take a man plays a guitar every
[2:36:21] day of his life
[2:36:22] &gt;&gt; before long I think he even said maybe
[2:36:23] back in Pentecost when he played in the
[2:36:25] tent meetings that he would get calluses
[2:36:28] on his fingers
[2:36:29] &gt;&gt; now come on somebody
[2:36:31] &gt;&gt; was he out doing something wrong
[2:36:34] &gt;&gt; was he out running around
[2:36:36] &gt;&gt; he was doing what he was called to do
[2:36:38] &gt;&gt; right
[2:36:39] &gt;&gt; that's right
[2:36:40] &gt;&gt; I'm preaching to you this morning
[2:36:42] &gt;&gt; people can do what they're called to do
[2:36:44] and sometimes still get hurt.
[2:36:48] &gt;&gt; And still get calluses just from the
[2:36:51] regular routine.
[2:36:55] &gt;&gt; And I want to tell that devil, calluses
[2:36:57] have been healed this weekend.
[2:37:02] &gt;&gt; Complexes have been broken this weekend.
[2:37:05] And I want to tell that devil, we refuse
[2:37:07] to let him form another one.
[2:37:09] &gt;&gt; We refuse to let him put another callous
[2:37:12] on our praise. We refuse to let him put
[2:37:15] another callus on our worship. We are
[2:37:17] not a bunch of vultures. We are not a
[2:37:19] bunch of black bears and grizzly bear.
[2:37:21] We are eagles who have been called to
[2:37:23] eat on the fresh meat of the world.
[2:37:28] &gt;&gt; That's good preaching.
[2:37:30] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm just going to take my liberty
[2:37:31] this morning and I'm going to say God
[2:37:33] bless everyone of Well, I'm going to
[2:37:34] back up real quick and say this.
[2:37:37] &gt;&gt; The world today is full, brother says,
[2:37:40] of callous clergymen.
[2:37:43] All right.
[2:37:45] &gt;&gt; But I want to say God bless every one of
[2:37:47] you pastors here today.
[2:37:50] &gt;&gt; I say God bless you, Ben, and God bless
[2:37:52] you, Brother Ben Beard. God bless you,
[2:37:53] brother Bo. God bless you, brother
[2:37:55] Wendle, brother Josh. I say God bless
[2:37:57] every one of these pastors that have
[2:37:59] been hurt. They've been cut. They've
[2:38:01] been stomped on. They've been broken.
[2:38:03] They've been talked about, falsely
[2:38:05] accused, but they come here this
[2:38:07] weekend. And you wouldn't know it unless
[2:38:09] they told you because they found some
[2:38:11] bomb and Gilead to let the washing of
[2:38:14] the water of the word heal the callous
[2:38:17] because they know if I don't have no
[2:38:19] feeling I'm wasting my time so they stay
[2:38:22] before God to keep the feeling of God in
[2:38:24] their hearts for the people of God.
[2:38:27] &gt;&gt; I say God bless you shepherds. Amen. I'm
[2:38:29] going to go ahead and just preach since
[2:38:31] I'm here. I say God bless every one of
[2:38:32] you pastor's wives.
[2:38:36] God bless every one of you pastors and
[2:38:38] ministers wives.
[2:38:40] I say God bless you. I say God bless you
[2:38:44] for seeing your husbands hurt, seeing
[2:38:46] them broken, seeing them disappointed,
[2:38:48] but you never got cold and you never got
[2:38:51] calloused and you didn't keep them in
[2:38:53] that condition. But you said, "Get up,
[2:38:55] honey, and go preach like you never
[2:38:57] preached before." Because there's some
[2:38:59] people out there and they need some
[2:39:00] help. There's families need some help.
[2:39:03] There's young people need an answer.
[2:39:07] Hallelujah. I say God bless sister
[2:39:09] Cheryl, brother Daryl for all the years.
[2:39:12] All the years. Amen. I say God bless you
[2:39:14] young people who are ministers kids.
[2:39:19] &gt;&gt; I say God bless you. You've seen things
[2:39:21] you should have never seen. You've heard
[2:39:23] things you should have never heard.
[2:39:25] You've been involved in things and had
[2:39:26] to endure things that you should have
[2:39:28] never had to. But I say God bless you
[2:39:30] because you know that there's more to
[2:39:32] serving God than a bunch of fussing and
[2:39:34] fighting.
[2:39:39] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm feeling good cuz the devil's
[2:39:41] nervous. Hallelujah. I say God bless
[2:39:43] every one of you deacons.
[2:39:48] &gt;&gt; I say God bless our deacons. I say God
[2:39:51] bless them. They see things. They hear
[2:39:53] things. They have to put up with things.
[2:39:57] Come on, folks. They have to go through.
[2:39:59] Brother Danny Ward, I say God bless you.
[2:40:01] I say God bless you and God bless you,
[2:40:04] Sister Vicki. And I say God bless you.
[2:40:06] God bless your health. God bless your
[2:40:08] family. God bless your everything. Cuz
[2:40:11] that man seen more than some people
[2:40:13] should ever see. But he's not here this
[2:40:15] morning. And he's not critically complex
[2:40:17] and all countless. But he's got a love
[2:40:19] for God in his soul. And he still loves
[2:40:22] the people. You know how that is?
[2:40:24] Because somewhere he found a place for
[2:40:27] the word to heal the calluses.
[2:40:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:40:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:40:35] &gt;&gt; And if you want to be a deacon, I may be
[2:40:37] taking liberty here.
[2:40:39] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:40:39] &gt;&gt; But if you want to be a deacon, go find
[2:40:41] an elder
[2:40:43] &gt;&gt; who's been through hell and high water
[2:40:46] and they still love the church and they
[2:40:48] still love God's people and they still
[2:40:50] love the atmosphere being right.
[2:40:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:40:54] Amen.
[2:40:56] &gt;&gt; I say God bless our song leaders.
[2:41:00] &gt;&gt; I say God bless our song leaders. Get
[2:41:02] criticized if they sing a fast song. Get
[2:41:05] criticized if they sing a slow song. Get
[2:41:07] talked about if they sing a new song.
[2:41:09] Get praised if they sing an ancient
[2:41:11] song. I say God bless you. God bless you
[2:41:14] song leaders who take your position in
[2:41:16] the house of God with a feeling in your
[2:41:19] heart and not just a song in your mouth
[2:41:21] or the right key on the piano but a love
[2:41:24] to see the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost
[2:41:26] move into the building.
[2:41:31] I'm sorry I'm under a burden this
[2:41:32] morning. I say hallelujah. I say God
[2:41:36] give us churches where the power of God
[2:41:38] can move without complexes and calluses
[2:41:41] and hurt feelings and bitterness.
[2:41:50] &gt;&gt; God bless you musicians.
[2:41:56] &gt;&gt; God bless you
[2:41:59] &gt;&gt; and especially God bless you drummers.
[2:42:06] Drums. No drums. Play drums. Don't play.
[2:42:07] Have drums of the devil. Drums are from
[2:42:09] God.
[2:42:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:42:13] &gt;&gt; As Doug Baker says, it's a drum.
[2:42:19] &gt;&gt; That's right, brother.
[2:42:23] &gt;&gt; The drum.
[2:42:28] &gt;&gt; Y'all know I'm in the message.
[2:42:35] God bless you sound people.
[2:42:40] &gt;&gt; Get run sound in your churches. Too
[2:42:43] loud, too quiet.
[2:42:45] &gt;&gt; Too high, too low. Don't sound y'all
[2:42:48] know what I'm preaching. But they still
[2:42:50] show up because it's more than just one
[2:42:53] weekend.
[2:42:54] &gt;&gt; Come on. I told our church back home and
[2:42:56] I tell this church right here, the
[2:42:58] reason you have meetings like we have is
[2:43:00] not because everything magically happens
[2:43:02] one weekend out of the year. It's
[2:43:04] because service after service after
[2:43:07] service after service, flesh is being
[2:43:09] crucified, feelings are being let go of,
[2:43:12] problems are being fixed, the word is
[2:43:14] being preached, and then when everybody
[2:43:15] comes together, there's an atmosphere
[2:43:18] conducive for a refreshing from the
[2:43:20] presence of the Lord.
[2:43:23] Hallelujah. Oh, this is what the message
[2:43:26] means to me. This is what class means to
[2:43:29] me is the power of God.
[2:43:32] &gt;&gt; Moving freely. Yeah.
[2:43:37] Hallelujah.
[2:43:39] &gt;&gt; I say this,
[2:43:40] &gt;&gt; I left somebody out. Forgive me. God
[2:43:42] bless every one of you.
[2:43:46] &gt;&gt; God bless you daddies. God bless you
[2:43:49] mamas. God bless you trustees. Spent too
[2:43:52] money, didn't spend enough. Paid too
[2:43:54] much for this, didn't pay enough. God
[2:43:56] bless you anyhow.
[2:44:01] Feeling good this morning.
[2:44:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You say, "Why are you
[2:44:05] feeling good?" Cuz there's a fresh
[2:44:07] feeling in the church. There's a fresh
[2:44:09] feeling in the hearts of God's people.
[2:44:11] And Judah, we're not going to let it
[2:44:12] become stale. We're not going to let it
[2:44:14] become negative and let it become
[2:44:15] critical. We're going to stand on our
[2:44:18] inaliable right as a son of God, as a
[2:44:21] daughter of God, for the power of God.
[2:44:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:44:30] &gt;&gt; Shake it off.
[2:44:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:44:37] &gt;&gt; Do it again, Bo.
[2:44:41] &gt;&gt; Just shake it off, brother Bo.
[2:44:45] &gt;&gt; Just Yes.
[2:44:47] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to read it to you. I'm
[2:44:48] going to preach it to you.
[2:44:49] &gt;&gt; A complex is like a is like a
[2:44:51] rattlesnake.
[2:44:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:44:53] &gt;&gt; It just lays there. Tanalyze it.
[2:44:55] Tanalyze it. Tanalyze it. And it'll
[2:44:57] never affect you.
[2:44:58] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:44:59] &gt;&gt; As long as you turn around and you walk
[2:45:02] off.
[2:45:04] &gt;&gt; As long as you hang the phone up.
[2:45:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, God.
[2:45:07] &gt;&gt; Woo. Glory. As long as you hang the
[2:45:09] phone up and you turn around and you
[2:45:12] walk off.
[2:45:14] You say, "Preacher, you lost your mind."
[2:45:16] No, I haven't. Because I know the
[2:45:18] necessity of the power of God in our
[2:45:20] churches. I know the need for liberty in
[2:45:22] our churches. And I'm going to tell you
[2:45:24] what Paul said. He said, "The time will
[2:45:26] come." He said, "When I come to you," he
[2:45:28] said, "I never was chargeable and I
[2:45:30] never was burdensome."
[2:45:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:45:33] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Well, I ain't got no
[2:45:34] friends." It's cuz you're chargeable and
[2:45:36] burdensome. Yes,
[2:45:39] &gt;&gt; I ain't got no friends. Cuz every time
[2:45:41] somebody gets around you, you talk about
[2:45:43] hope. Nobody likes you and everybody's
[2:45:46] against you and so and so told this on
[2:45:48] you and so and so done that and then
[2:45:50] somebody breaks through again to give
[2:45:52] you some grace to take you out to supper
[2:45:55] and maybe this is a different time and
[2:45:57] maybe things will be different and you
[2:45:59] no more and sit down and you start
[2:46:01] talking about well if I was a good
[2:46:03] preacher if I was a powerful preacher
[2:46:05] and I was a good singer I'm going to
[2:46:07] tell you what that is it ain't spiritual
[2:46:09] it's a complex and it makes you
[2:46:11] chargeable and burdensome fellowship.
[2:46:17] &gt;&gt; You all know I'm telling the truth.
[2:46:19] Amen. Well, oh God have mercy.
[2:46:22] &gt;&gt; I got to get out of here, man. I got to
[2:46:24] get out of here. But I got to say it.
[2:46:26] Clear the atmosphere of complexes.
[2:46:30] &gt;&gt; Josh, brother Josh said, "What kind of
[2:46:32] church would we have if we got some
[2:46:34] churches like the woman in Memphis and
[2:46:36] the woman in Mexico?" You know when I
[2:46:38] say what kind of churches would we have
[2:46:40] if we got a woman like Memphis, a woman
[2:46:43] like Mexico, and a spirit like a prophet
[2:46:45] in standing in the gap and say, "I'm
[2:46:47] done with this complex. I crucify this
[2:46:50] thing.
[2:46:52] I'm going to let it go. I'm going on
[2:46:54] with Jesus. I'm coming out of this stall
[2:46:58] state of mind. I've lost too many
[2:47:00] services. I've passed up too many
[2:47:02] blessings. I've been robbed of too many
[2:47:04] opportunities. I'm going to shake it off
[2:47:06] in the fire. I'm going on with Jesus
[2:47:09] just the same. Amen.
[2:47:13] I got my feeling back. Hey, I know they
[2:47:15] going to talk about me. Hey, I got my
[2:47:18] feeling back this morning. We got our
[2:47:20] feeling back over here. You make fun of
[2:47:22] us if you want to, but don't it feel
[2:47:24] good to feel God?
[2:47:27] &gt;&gt; Don't it feel good to feel the power of
[2:47:30] God? Don't it feel good to feel that
[2:47:32] freshness?
[2:47:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:47:35] [Applause]
[2:47:36] God, I could sing right now, Kobe, but I
[2:47:38] know I can't. I'm free. I'm free. Praise
[2:47:41] the Lord. I'm free. There's no more
[2:47:44] complexes. There's no more shackles.
[2:47:46] There's no more inferior complexes.
[2:47:48] There's no more smart complexes.
[2:47:51] &gt;&gt; I'm free. I've been in the presence of
[2:47:54] God.
[2:47:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:47:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:48:00] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:48:00] &gt;&gt; Now,
[2:48:01] &gt;&gt; that's good.
[2:48:02] &gt;&gt; I'm out of time.
[2:48:04] That was weak.
[2:48:10] &gt;&gt; You build up a complex. Brother said
[2:48:12] because you hear something.
[2:48:15] &gt;&gt; You know what else he said?
[2:48:18] &gt;&gt; He said you start thinking something.
[2:48:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:48:21] &gt;&gt; And you keep thinking it.
[2:48:23] &gt;&gt; He said let it go.
[2:48:26] &gt;&gt; Let it go.
[2:48:28] &gt;&gt; I'm closing on this.
[2:48:30] &gt;&gt; There's been a purge in here this
[2:48:31] weekend.
[2:48:34] I can raise my hand.
[2:48:38] &gt;&gt; Brother Nate been a purging.
[2:48:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:48:40] &gt;&gt; The 11's gone.
[2:48:42] &gt;&gt; It ain't coming back.
[2:48:47] &gt;&gt; It's gone.
[2:48:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:48:49] &gt;&gt; It ain't coming back.
[2:48:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:48:51] &gt;&gt; Brother said, "Look, with the unleavened
[2:48:53] bread of sincerity and truth, instead of
[2:48:55] now, now I'm going to skip over this.
[2:48:58] &gt;&gt; Bring some sincerity back in there."
[2:49:00] &gt;&gt; Yes. Look, because there's something in
[2:49:02] you pulsating and you want to do it.
[2:49:04] Paul says this, "Be renewed in the
[2:49:08] spirit of your mind." Paul in the in the
[2:49:09] Amplified Bible says, "Having be
[2:49:12] continually renewed in the spirit of
[2:49:13] your mind, having a fresh
[2:49:19] &gt;&gt; untarnished mental
[2:49:23] &gt;&gt; and spiritual attitude."
[2:49:26] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:49:27] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm just going to say what he said.
[2:49:30] How many How many wants this revival to
[2:49:32] leave this building and go to your
[2:49:33] churches?
[2:49:36] &gt;&gt; How many wants this revival word of life
[2:49:38] to stay in your church word of life
[2:49:40] &gt;&gt; in your people
[2:49:42] &gt;&gt; moving fresh in your hearts
[2:49:46] &gt;&gt; if we could just get the church in a
[2:49:48] real spiritual attitude then there will
[2:49:50] be a revival really. It'll be so much
[2:49:53] better for our prayers for the sick as
[2:49:55] long as our conditions are slumping.
[2:49:57] Then we just don't seem to pick it up
[2:49:58] like we should. But when everybody's
[2:50:00] just prayed up,
[2:50:02] &gt;&gt; amen.
[2:50:03] &gt;&gt; Can I say it?
[2:50:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:50:05] &gt;&gt; And keyed high.
[2:50:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:50:08] &gt;&gt; And a great expectation. I've walked to
[2:50:10] the platform and many times be five and
[2:50:13] six, 7,000 people and not be one feeble
[2:50:16] person as soon as you walked out on the
[2:50:18] platform. everyone get up out of their
[2:50:20] wheelchairs, their cotss, and their
[2:50:22] stretchers and walk right away because
[2:50:25] you're under such an expectation.
[2:50:29] &gt;&gt; He said, "Listen this morning." Amen. If
[2:50:31] you're either saved or you're not,
[2:50:32] you're either a saint or a sinner.
[2:50:34] You're either spiritual attitude towards
[2:50:36] God or not. And your spiritual attitude
[2:50:38] towards God's word identifies exactly
[2:50:40] where you're standing.
[2:50:41] &gt;&gt; It is. That's right.
[2:50:43] &gt;&gt; And your attitude towards that
[2:50:45] identifies whether you have spiritual
[2:50:46] amnesia or not. What are you saying,
[2:50:48] preacher? I'm saying this. Say it with
[2:50:50] me. Lord
[2:50:52] &gt;&gt; put the feeling back in it.
[2:50:56] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[2:50:58] &gt;&gt; put the feeling back in it.
[2:51:01] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[2:51:02] &gt;&gt; put the feeling back in my sink.
[2:51:05] &gt;&gt; Put the feeling back in it. Lord,
[2:51:07] &gt;&gt; I don't want to go another day without
[2:51:09] that feeling.
[2:51:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:51:13] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you this and I'm done.
[2:51:15] &gt;&gt; When you got feeling Other people will
[2:51:18] know it.
[2:51:19] [Applause]
[2:51:21] &gt;&gt; When you got feeling, other people will
[2:51:24] know it. I'll prove it to you. They'll
[2:51:25] know it by your handshake.
[2:51:28] &gt;&gt; Brother said, "Me and my wife were going
[2:51:30] down the road the other day and he said,
[2:51:32] "There was a lady passed by and she
[2:51:34] said, "How do Miss Brandham?" Sister
[2:51:35] Brandham, Brother said, "I looked over
[2:51:37] and said we kept going and my wife, I
[2:51:39] said to my wife, honey, them people
[2:51:41] spoke to you. Why didn't you say
[2:51:42] nothing?" She said, "Oh, I smiled.
[2:51:46] I smiled. You know what brother M said?
[2:51:48] He said, "Honey, I'm sitting next to you
[2:51:51] and didn't hear what you said and
[2:51:52] smiled. She was on the other side of the
[2:51:54] road. I know she didn't hear it." You
[2:51:57] know what he said? He said, "You know
[2:51:58] what I like?" Amen. I don't like a
[2:52:00] little old silly grin. I like a good old
[2:52:03] pump handle handshake.
[2:52:06] &gt;&gt; I say, "God, bring back the pump handle
[2:52:08] handshakes to the house of God. Let's
[2:52:10] get rid of these little silly grins and
[2:52:12] these little silly nods. And let's bring
[2:52:14] back the love of God with a good
[2:52:16] oldfashioned pump handle hand. Say,
[2:52:18] "Brother, I love you. I love you with
[2:52:20] all my heart. I pray the Holy Ghost
[2:52:22] bless you. Josh, I pray the Holy Ghost
[2:52:24] use you." Brother Wimble, I pray you
[2:52:26] bless Paul knee. Brother Daryl, I pray
[2:52:28] you shake the world through you. Brother
[2:52:30] Aaron, I pray God use you. I pray God
[2:52:32] shake Virginia with you. Judah, I pray
[2:52:34] the Holy Ghost move in the power of his
[2:52:37] love and the power of unity and the
[2:52:39] power of the spirit. Come on, church.
[2:52:41] I'm closing on this. It's worth fighting
[2:52:44] for.
[2:52:46] It's worth fighting for. And sometimes
[2:52:48] to fight for it. We got to crucify our
[2:52:50] flesh. We got to die to our carnal
[2:52:53] thinking. We got to die to our own
[2:52:55] intellectual agenda. But let the love of
[2:52:57] God
[2:52:59] Hallelujah. Stand on your feet and give
[2:53:01] God praise. Let the love of God,
[2:53:06] &gt;&gt; let it flow.
[2:53:10] &gt;&gt; Let it flow.
[2:53:15] &gt;&gt; I pray the Holy Ghost shake Dyresburg
[2:53:17] through you.
[2:53:19] &gt;&gt; I pray the Holy Ghost heal your body and
[2:53:21] move through you like he's never moved
[2:53:23] before.
[2:53:24] &gt;&gt; Miguel, I pray this is just the
[2:53:26] beginning of your family being saved. I
[2:53:29] pray more come in. I pray that everyone
[2:53:31] come home, buddy. I pray God open this
[2:53:33] message to you like it's never been open
[2:53:35] to anybody else.
[2:53:38] &gt;&gt; This is the feeling of God for the
[2:53:40] people of God.
[2:53:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:53:45] &gt;&gt; Now,
[2:53:47] I'd like to get by, but I can't.
[2:53:49] &gt;&gt; It's right there in front of me.
[2:53:52] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:53:54] But it's on the end.
[2:53:56] Paul Raider got up one morning and had a
[2:53:58] little spat with his wife.
[2:54:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:54:03] &gt;&gt; Went through the regular routine, hugged
[2:54:06] her,
[2:54:07] &gt;&gt; kissed her.
[2:54:09] &gt;&gt; Went out the door and got down the road
[2:54:11] and got to thinking,
[2:54:14] &gt;&gt; "What if this is the last time I ever
[2:54:15] see her?
[2:54:16] &gt;&gt; What if something happens to the mom of
[2:54:18] my babies? What if something happens to
[2:54:20] the to the wife of my home, the the lady
[2:54:22] of my life?
[2:54:23] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[2:54:25] &gt;&gt; Turned around and drove back home.
[2:54:27] Got out, went back in, did the same
[2:54:30] thing over.
[2:54:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[2:54:31] &gt;&gt; brother Chris, they asked him. They
[2:54:33] said, "What was the difference?" He
[2:54:34] said, "That time there was feeling in
[2:54:36] it,
[2:54:37] &gt;&gt; right?"
[2:54:38] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:54:40] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, Lord,
[2:54:43] bring back the feeling.
[2:54:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:54:46] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. I got to say what a prophet
[2:54:48] of God said. He said, "I pray God will
[2:54:51] place in your heart that's something
[2:54:53] that I lost out there in that complex.
[2:54:56] &gt;&gt; It's so easy to build one."
[2:55:00] &gt;&gt; He said, "Don't lose the feeling of the
[2:55:02] people." See, you must remember they're
[2:55:05] not made out of sawdust.
[2:55:08] &gt;&gt; They are flesh and blood.
[2:55:10] &gt;&gt; They're human beings
[2:55:13] &gt;&gt; and they have a soul.
[2:55:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:55:17] That's right.
[2:55:17] &gt;&gt; I don't know about you this morning, but
[2:55:19] I just want to get somewhere and weep.
[2:55:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:55:22] &gt;&gt; I just want to get somewhere and say,
[2:55:24] "Lord, don't ever let the routine cause
[2:55:27] me to build a complex."
[2:55:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:55:31] &gt;&gt; How about you this morning?
[2:55:33] &gt;&gt; How about you say this morning, Lord, in
[2:55:34] my heart, I feel that freshness.
[2:55:39] &gt;&gt; How can you be in a meeting like we had
[2:55:40] here this weekend and not feel that
[2:55:42] freshness?
[2:55:44] But you're going to have to fight for
[2:55:45] it.
[2:55:47] &gt;&gt; You're going to have to fight to keep
[2:55:48] it.
[2:55:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:55:49] &gt;&gt; The devil ain't going to just go down
[2:55:50] the road and leave you alone.
[2:55:52] &gt;&gt; He'll follow you home,
[2:55:54] &gt;&gt; follow you back to your churches on
[2:55:56] Wednesday night.
[2:55:57] &gt;&gt; He'll do everything he can to take that
[2:56:00] freshness out of your life
[2:56:02] &gt;&gt; and make that feeling stale.
[2:56:05] [Music]
[2:56:07] [Applause]
[2:56:10] &gt;&gt; But this is a different generation.
[2:56:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:56:14] This is a different people.
[2:56:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:56:16] &gt;&gt; The devil don't know what to do with
[2:56:18] this people
[2:56:19] &gt;&gt; because they let things go
[2:56:22] &gt;&gt; and they love
[2:56:23] &gt;&gt; and they forgive.
[2:56:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:56:25] &gt;&gt; They look beyond the present
[2:56:28] &gt;&gt; into the future and they strive.
[2:56:32] I don't know about you this morning. I
[2:56:33] I'm sorry. And I know this probably
[2:56:35] wasn't a closing shout meeting,
[2:56:39] &gt;&gt; but I I I pray that from the depths of
[2:56:42] my heart.
[2:56:44] You can see,
[2:56:47] you're the people of God.
[2:56:51] &gt;&gt; The person sitting next to you is the
[2:56:54] purchase of his blood.
[2:56:57] &gt;&gt; They're not just some crazy person you
[2:56:59] go to church with.
[2:57:01] And they're not just that holy roller
[2:57:03] you try to avoid at Walmart.
[2:57:06] &gt;&gt; No,
[2:57:08] for the queen of heaven.
[2:57:10] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[2:57:11] &gt;&gt; And if you lose your feeling for them,
[2:57:14] &gt;&gt; you'll lose it for the church.
[2:57:16] &gt;&gt; And then you'll lose it for your
[2:57:17] position.
[2:57:19] &gt;&gt; And then you'll lose it for what God's
[2:57:20] called you to do.
[2:57:22] &gt;&gt; But you say, "Lord, whatever I got to
[2:57:24] do,
[2:57:25] &gt;&gt; I want to keep it."
[2:57:28] I
[2:57:28] &gt;&gt; heard brother Josh say one time, brother
[2:57:31] Josh Bennett here. He said, "I've
[2:57:33] crucified my flesh too many times to let
[2:57:36] the enemy have his way now."
[2:57:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:57:39] &gt;&gt; And folks, I'm standing on the authority
[2:57:41] of this word this morning. And I think
[2:57:43] that's a very powerful and profound
[2:57:45] statement. I think it's time to keep
[2:57:47] crucifying our flesh.
[2:57:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:57:49] &gt;&gt; And let the life of Christ
[2:57:51] &gt;&gt; be manifested.
[2:57:52] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. How many say, "Lord, I
[2:57:55] give myself
[2:57:57] &gt;&gt; I give myself to you."
[2:58:00] &gt;&gt; Lord, I've been hurt, but there's a bomb
[2:58:03] in Gilead this morning.
[2:58:05] &gt;&gt; Lord, I've been disappointed,
[2:58:08] but I'm not going to let that control my
[2:58:09] feeling.
[2:58:11] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to let that control the
[2:58:12] way I praise you, Lord.
[2:58:14] &gt;&gt; These meetings have broke things off in
[2:58:16] my life, and I know the devil's going to
[2:58:18] try to put it back on there, but Lord,
[2:58:20] I'm not letting it come back. Amen.
[2:58:22] &gt;&gt; I'm going to walk every day in faith.
[2:58:24] &gt;&gt; Whether I feel like it in my whether I
[2:58:26] feel like it in my flesh or not. I'm not
[2:58:27] going by my feelings of being led by
[2:58:29] feelings. I'm going by the love the
[2:58:31] feelings. The love of God in my heart.
[2:58:34] Oh God.
[2:58:36] How many this morning say, "Lord, keep
[2:58:38] me fresh."
[2:58:39] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:58:41] &gt;&gt; Maybe you're here. You're an officer in
[2:58:42] your local church or you're an officer
[2:58:44] in this church. You say, "Lord, keep me
[2:58:47] fresh.
[2:58:49] People need me. Lord, I need the people.
[2:58:53] Say, "God bless you this morning. God
[2:58:55] bless you this morning. I need you. You
[2:58:59] need me. We need each other.
[2:59:02] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:59:02] &gt;&gt; We don't have time for losing the
[2:59:05] feeling of God.
[2:59:06] &gt;&gt; We got a message to be preached.
[2:59:09] &gt;&gt; We got demons to be defeated.
[2:59:11] &gt;&gt; We got a rapture to take.
[2:59:13] &gt;&gt; We got a sword to hold right there at
[2:59:15] the head of that devil and say, "Satan,
[2:59:17] you won't control me another day.
[2:59:21] Would
[2:59:21] &gt;&gt; you this morning just lay your hand on
[2:59:22] someone standing next to you,
[2:59:25] &gt;&gt; brother to brother, sister to sister,
[2:59:28] husband to wife in godly order this
[2:59:30] morning. As we lay our hands up on one
[2:59:33] another today, I wonder if there be one
[2:59:35] can say, "Lord, I join my faith with my
[2:59:38] brother.
[2:59:39] &gt;&gt; I join my faith with my sister.
[2:59:42] &gt;&gt; I join with them today. Lord,
[2:59:44] &gt;&gt; I'm joining with them in this battle.
[2:59:47] They're not bad people. I'm not a bad
[2:59:48] person. We're not a bunch of sinners.
[2:59:50] We're not a We're not a bunch of
[2:59:52] backsliders. We're not a bunch of a
[2:59:54] bunch of a bunch of people renegades or
[2:59:56] rickettes or rickers or rickettas or
[2:59:58] Ricky's or whatever this bunch. We're
[3:00:00] none of that. We're brothers and
[3:00:01] sisters.
[3:00:01] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[3:00:02] &gt;&gt; We're the children of God. We're the
[3:00:04] people of God. We're the purchase of the
[3:00:06] blood of God. And you've been hurt and
[3:00:08] I've been hurt. You've been cut and I've
[3:00:10] been cut. We've been wounded. But we're
[3:00:12] going to lay that aside today. We're not
[3:00:15] going to let this callous take over our
[3:00:16] praise. We're not going to become a
[3:00:18] complex church member. We're going to
[3:00:20] keep the fresh feeling of God in our
[3:00:22] souls. We're going to we're going to
[3:00:24] look past the faults and the mistakes.
[3:00:26] And we're going to find the good in
[3:00:27] situations. We're going to find the
[3:00:29] positive in situations. We're going to
[3:00:31] die out to our own ambitions. We want
[3:00:34] the right spirit, Lord. We want the
[3:00:35] right motive. We want the right
[3:00:36] objective, Lord. I know today there's
[3:00:38] many there's many here from other
[3:00:40] churches. You say, "Lord, Amen. Let our
[3:00:42] church have a feeling behind it, Lord."
[3:00:44] Amen. Let our singing and let our
[3:00:46] preaching, let there be a feeling behind
[3:00:48] it. Amen. The Holy Ghost right now is
[3:00:50] settling over the congregation. He's
[3:00:52] moving right now in a special way. He's
[3:00:54] healing and he's he's bringing bomb to
[3:00:56] to hurts and cuts right now. Won't you
[3:00:59] join with me today? Heavenly Father,
[3:01:01] Lord, as we come to the close of these
[3:01:02] meetings, Lord, Father, as we stand here
[3:01:05] today, Lord, as your servant, Lord,
[3:01:07] delivered what you so burdened my heart
[3:01:09] with this morning, dear God. Father, I
[3:01:11] believe that your word is true. And I
[3:01:14] believe that truth has been preached
[3:01:15] here this weekend, Lord. Father, I know
[3:01:17] the devil has done everything he can,
[3:01:19] Lord, to defeat every one of these
[3:01:21] believers and to defeat every one of
[3:01:23] these preachers and to defeat every one
[3:01:24] of these musicians and song leaders and
[3:01:26] deacons and trustees and and ministers
[3:01:29] families and lay members and and Sunday
[3:01:31] school teachers and and Lord, all the
[3:01:34] I'm sorry, Lord, I'm failing to mention
[3:01:36] some I know, but Lord, you know my
[3:01:38] heart. And Lord, you know they're not
[3:01:39] out gambling. They're they're not out
[3:01:41] running women and and corrals and
[3:01:43] they're not out chasing men and and and
[3:01:46] drugs and stuff, Lord. They're serving
[3:01:47] you faithfully, Lord. They're at their
[3:01:49] posted duty faithfully. And Lord,
[3:01:51] sometimes we get hurt, Lord. Sometimes
[3:01:53] we get cut. And Lord, sometimes it's not
[3:01:56] just a flesh wound. It's not just a skin
[3:01:58] wound, but oh God, it becomes a deep
[3:02:00] cut. And the devil wants to pour
[3:02:02] confession in there. But today, Lord, as
[3:02:04] the body of Jesus Christ, as the
[3:02:06] believers of Jesus Christ, as the sons
[3:02:09] and daughters of God, we stand upon the
[3:02:11] authority of the love of God, we stand
[3:02:14] upon the power of the elective love of
[3:02:17] God. And we say, Satan, in the name of
[3:02:19] Jesus, we rebuke you. We drive you out
[3:02:22] of our homes. We drive you out of
[3:02:24] marriages. We drive you out of families.
[3:02:26] We drive you out of churches. Satan, in
[3:02:28] the name of Jesus, you have been
[3:02:30] defeated here this weekend. And may the
[3:02:32] power of the Holy Ghost may it accompany
[3:02:35] every one of these believers when they
[3:02:36] leave here. Lord, may there if they've
[3:02:38] lost their feeling, Lord, if they've
[3:02:40] lost their feeling and their passion and
[3:02:42] the passion of this revival, Lord, if
[3:02:44] the fire in this message has become cold
[3:02:47] and Lord, it's dried up on them. Lord, I
[3:02:49] pray this weekend, dear God, that a cold
[3:02:52] of fire has come up off the altar and
[3:02:54] has ignited their hearts, has it
[3:02:56] reignited their ministries, oh God, has
[3:02:59] refreshed their talents, has anointed
[3:03:01] their gifts, oh God. Lord, I pray for
[3:03:03] every fifth gospel here, Lord. I know
[3:03:05] sometimes, amen, that mamas can go
[3:03:07] through things, Lord, and it takes the
[3:03:09] very life out of them, but oh God, I
[3:03:11] pray by the power of the Holy Spirit,
[3:03:14] Lord, may you refresh every mama here.
[3:03:17] May you refresh the little the little
[3:03:18] pastor of them children that little
[3:03:20] fifth gospel in the name of Jesus. Lord,
[3:03:23] may the desires of the hearts of the
[3:03:25] mothers, Lord, may they become
[3:03:26] testimonies in the lives of their
[3:03:28] children, oh God. Father, I pray for the
[3:03:30] fathers here today, Lord. They stand in
[3:03:32] the gap near God, between the outside
[3:03:35] world and that little family, that
[3:03:36] little home you've given them. But oh
[3:03:38] God, I pray I pray a blessing upon them,
[3:03:41] Lord. I pray the power of God upon them.
[3:03:43] I pray the strength of God. I pray the
[3:03:46] leadership of God and the wisdom of God
[3:03:48] would be their portion. Lord, in the
[3:03:50] name of Jesus, may you bind us together,
[3:03:53] Lord. May you bind us together, Lord,
[3:03:55] with a cord that cannot easily be
[3:03:57] broken, Lord. In the name of Jesus, we
[3:04:00] receive the victory today. We receive
[3:04:02] the victory today. We receive the
[3:04:04] victory today. The victory and love
[3:04:07] divine. Oh, because they've chosen the
[3:04:09] harder way. There's a great portion
[3:04:11] laying ahead for them. And father, I
[3:04:13] pray today, dear God, as we close these
[3:04:16] meetings out as we go our separate ways.
[3:04:19] Lord, take our hand and lead us in the
[3:04:21] harder way. Lord, let us stay behind the
[3:04:23] pillar of fire. Let us stay behind what
[3:04:25] your prophet taught. Let us stay behind
[3:04:28] the message of the hour. For Lord, your
[3:04:30] prophet said those that follow the
[3:04:31] pillar of fire, they'll have a hard way.
[3:04:34] Oh, but they'll be ready for the
[3:04:36] translation on that morning. And Lord,
[3:04:38] just any day now, just any day now, our
[3:04:41] bodies are going to be changed. We're
[3:04:42] going to lay down our swords. We're
[3:04:44] going to lay down our shields. We're
[3:04:46] going to lay down our weapons. We're
[3:04:47] going to put on a new body. We're going
[3:04:49] to walk down the streets of cold. We're
[3:04:51] going to be rejoined for our loved ones.
[3:04:53] Oh, Father, may the fight of God remain
[3:04:56] in the hearts of your children. In the
[3:04:58] name of Jesus. In the name of Jesus. I
[3:05:01] give myself to you this morning. I give
[3:05:03] this congregation to you this morning.
[3:05:06] In the name of Jesus, we stand as the
[3:05:09] bride of Jesus Christ, pursuing the
[3:05:11] promises of Christ. In the name of the
[3:05:14] Lord Jesus Christ. In the name of Jesus
[3:05:17] Christ. In the name of Jesus Christ. Oh,
[3:05:21] these are good people, Lord. These are
[3:05:24] your people, Lord. Father, they've been
[3:05:26] through things and seen things. Been
[3:05:28] through beatating sessions, Lord, and
[3:05:30] legalistic sermons and hard things. Seen
[3:05:32] things they should have never seen,
[3:05:34] Lord. but your word still prevails in
[3:05:36] their life. And Lord, I thank you for
[3:05:38] this congregation of people, Lord, that
[3:05:40] your character and forgiveness and love
[3:05:43] and flexibility is still on display in
[3:05:45] their lives. Father, may it never leave,
[3:05:48] Lord. Lord, may it never leave our
[3:05:51] hearts. Oh God, in the name of Jesus,
[3:05:55] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus,
[3:05:58] in the name of Jesus.
[3:06:02] Hallelujah.
[3:06:04] Hallelujah.
[3:06:06] How many just want to raise your hands
[3:06:07] this morning and love him?
[3:06:10] How many just want to raise your hands
[3:06:12] this morning and love him? Say, Lord, I
[3:06:15] thank you.
[3:06:16] &gt;&gt; Lord, I thank you for the freshness.
[3:06:18] Lord, I thank you for the refilling of
[3:06:21] the Holy Spirit here this weekend. Lord,
[3:06:23] I thank you for it. Lord, I thank you
[3:06:26] for it this morning. Brother Kobe,

[3:06:34] I love you for the love of the Lord,
[3:06:35] folks. God bless you. God richly bless
[3:06:39] you. I pray something's been said this
[3:06:41] morning to help you. I pray I pray you
[3:06:44] know my heart this morning. Brother Dan,
[3:06:46] I thank you. I thank you for the
[3:06:48] opportunity to stand here once again.
[3:06:50] Let's fight the battles. Let's move
[3:06:53] forward. Thank you for your attention
[3:06:55] this morning. God bless you today.
[3:07:00] Oh, there is he that is the presence.

[3:07:24] Seeing in the presence, you just lift
[3:07:28] your hands and sing that this morning.
[3:07:33] [Music]

[3:08:56] Oh, his presence.

[3:09:04] [Music]
[3:09:05] Oh, I'm not perfect.
[3:09:09] Oh, I'm changed
[3:09:12] forever
[3:09:14] in his presence.
[3:09:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Aren't you glad for his
[3:09:19] presence this morning? Give him a hand
[3:09:21] clap of praise.
[3:09:30] I told someone this week I was talking
[3:09:33] about complexes and they said, "Well,
[3:09:35] they gave me a complex." I said, "No one
[3:09:37] can give you a complex. They can give
[3:09:39] you a materials to build a complex, but
[3:09:43] you have to build it." If you could ever
[3:09:45] just walk away and say, "I I refuse to
[3:09:48] build."
[3:09:50] &gt;&gt; People are going to hurt you. You're
[3:09:51] going to get hurt.
[3:09:52] &gt;&gt; I've always prayed, "God, help me not to
[3:09:54] hurt people." Amen.
[3:09:56] &gt;&gt; Cuz I come from a background, brother
[3:09:57] Joel did as well, that we've seen people
[3:10:00] get hurt and we were hurt as children.
[3:10:03] We didn't want to hurt people.
[3:10:05] &gt;&gt; And and yet you do inadvertently at
[3:10:07] times you say things that maybe a little
[3:10:09] sharp or something. God help the people
[3:10:11] to know that I love them, you know, and
[3:10:13] they'll overlook that. I might
[3:10:16] inadvertently hand you the material to
[3:10:18] build a complex, but just say, Lord, I'm
[3:10:20] not going to build it. I'm going to be
[3:10:21] free in his presence.
[3:10:23] I I'm going to I'm going to walk free
[3:10:25] from these meetings. You love him this
[3:10:27] morning.
[3:10:28] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad to be a Christian today?
[3:10:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. I I think from the very beginning,
[3:10:34] the
[3:10:36] everything that's been done, the the
[3:10:37] messages that have been preached has
[3:10:38] just been ordered by the Lord. That's
[3:10:40] right.
[3:10:41] &gt;&gt; And uh my goodness, what was preached on
[3:10:44] Thursday and Friday and Saturday
[3:10:46] morning, Saturday night, and this
[3:10:48] morning, I believe we could take that
[3:10:50] home and and just believe it and it'd be
[3:10:53] enough word to last. I I told Brother
[3:10:56] Joel, I said, "My flesh wants to cancel
[3:10:58] Wednesday night service, but we're not
[3:10:59] going to. We're going to have church."
[3:11:03] Come on. That's all right.
[3:11:09] And uh the reason I said that is because
[3:11:11] number one, I'm tired. Number two, I
[3:11:13] these brothers preach so well. Thought
[3:11:15] what am I going to do? But uh I believe
[3:11:18] there'll be an expectation of the
[3:11:19] presence of the Lord.
[3:11:21] &gt;&gt; I want to say this. I And you you miss
[3:11:23] always miss people. But brother Joel,
[3:11:25] come up here a minute. And I uh had him
[3:11:28] written down this morning to to thank
[3:11:31] brother Joel for what he does here for
[3:11:32] the church. And I didn't do it. I I
[3:11:34] failed to do it. It's one thing when you
[3:11:36] forget and you don't write it down. It's
[3:11:37] another thing when you write it down,
[3:11:38] you still forget it. But I am getting
[3:11:41] old. But brother Joel and I kid each
[3:11:43] other. Come here, Brother Joel. We kid
[3:11:45] each other a lot. But what we do here,
[3:11:46] we do as a team. And brother Joel, the
[3:11:49] reason he walks funny is because he fell
[3:11:51] through the roof of the building.
[3:11:53] You really did helping us put uh wires
[3:11:56] in the roof so you could have sound. and
[3:11:58] and I really I love my brother and God
[3:12:01] gave him to me to to be I I believe I've
[3:12:04] been a help to him and he's been a help
[3:12:06] to me. And don't we love Brother Joel
[3:12:07] here in the church? I glad to have him.
[3:12:13] [Music]
[3:12:15] And uh I'll say this, he works harder
[3:12:19] than I do on these meetings and we would
[3:12:21] not have been able to do it over the
[3:12:22] past 5 years without brother Joel. So I
[3:12:24] love you buddy. Thank you for being He's
[3:12:26] my associate pastor here at the church
[3:12:28] and we love him very much.
[3:12:36] Thank you for being with us. Those of
[3:12:38] you sitting back in the foyer, I'm sorry
[3:12:40] you got to sit back there, but we sure
[3:12:42] appreciate you coming. And I know some
[3:12:44] have said even uh at the fellowship hall
[3:12:47] and during different nights and and
[3:12:48] listened and things, thank you for
[3:12:50] coming. Thank your pastors once again
[3:12:51] for allowing you to come. Let's just
[3:12:54] worship in his presence. Again, what
[3:12:55] we've done in every service is we just
[3:12:57] allowed you time to worship and yet if
[3:13:00] you need to go, you can go. So, we'll do
[3:13:01] that again this morning. Let's bow our
[3:13:03] heads one more time and and just ask the
[3:13:06] Lord to bless the food and bless your
[3:13:09] travels. If some of you have to go home
[3:13:11] today, let's just pray. Heavenly Father,
[3:13:13] we're so thankful to be in your presence
[3:13:15] once again. I pray God that you just
[3:13:18] move and Lord, may the word settle into
[3:13:21] our hearts. Lord, may we not be
[3:13:23] forgetful hearers of the word, but doers
[3:13:25] of the word. Lord, that we would not
[3:13:27] just say it, Lord, as many times that we
[3:13:30] we tend to say things, but Lord, may we
[3:13:32] do it, Lord. May we really forgive and
[3:13:35] really love and really press the battle
[3:13:37] and really do what's been taught us to
[3:13:39] do, what we've been what we've heard
[3:13:41] over this weekend. I pray you'd bless
[3:13:43] these pastors, Lord. Brother Josh and
[3:13:45] Brother Wendell and these evangelists,
[3:13:47] Brother Daryl and and Brother Andrew.
[3:13:49] Lord, I pray you would give them, Lord,
[3:13:52] a furtherance of their ministry. May
[3:13:53] they preach things that, Lord, deeper
[3:13:56] than they ever have before, with more
[3:13:57] fire than they ever have before. Pray
[3:13:59] you'd strengthen their bodies and their
[3:14:00] minds. Pray your spirit would be with
[3:14:02] them. We thank you for their their
[3:14:05] dedication, their service this weekend.
[3:14:06] I pray you bless each one. I pray you
[3:14:08] just move, bless the food, nourish it to
[3:14:10] our bodies. We pray in Jesus' name.
[3:14:13] Amen. God bless you. You're free to stay
[3:14:15] and worship or if you need to go and go
[3:14:17] ahead and get something to eat, you're
[3:14:19] welcome to do that as well. God bless
[3:14:20] you. There'll be food at the fellowship
[3:14:22] hall. Thank you for coming. Aren't you
[3:14:24] glad to be in the house of the Lord?
