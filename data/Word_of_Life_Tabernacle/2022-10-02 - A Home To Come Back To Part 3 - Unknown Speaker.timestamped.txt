[51:46] it dispels all the Gloom oh God lord may
[51:50] we rejoice in your presence today we
[51:52] pray in Jesus name amen
[51:55] amen God bless you second Kings chapter
[51:58] 11 verses 1 through 3.
[52:03] Second Kings 11 1-3
[52:08] so good to be here on a Sunday morning I
[52:11] wouldn't want to be anywhere else
[52:12] but to be with you people wherever you
[52:15] are that's where we want to be and
[52:16] because we're all children of God do you
[52:18] believe that this morning amen
[52:21] Second Kings 11
[52:24] verse 1 and when
[52:26] a Thalia the mother of ahaziah saw that
[52:29] her son was dead
[52:31] she arose and destroyed all the seed
[52:35] Royal
[52:36] but jehoshiba the daughter of King joram
[52:39] sister of a Isaiah took joash the son of
[52:43] ahaziah and stole him from among the
[52:46] king's Sons which were slain
[52:48] and they hid him
[52:50] even him and his nurse in the bed
[52:53] Chamber from a Thalia so that he was not
[52:56] slain
[52:59] and he was with her hit in the house of
[53:01] the Lord six years
[53:03] and a Thalia did Reign Over
[53:07] the land I pray the Lord without his
[53:09] Blessing to the word you may be seated
[53:11] this morning I want to continue on our
[53:13] thought a home to come back to a home to
[53:18] come back to
[53:20] during a thalia's reign as Queen the
[53:24] child joash was constantly in danger
[53:27] because she had decided that any uh any
[53:33] child of the King was a threat to her
[53:36] and because she knew the potential that
[53:40] he had to overthrow her Reign and we
[53:43] don't realize it today I don't think we
[53:46] recognize it as much sometimes as the
[53:48] devil does that we have the potential to
[53:52] overthrow his Reign here in laodicea he
[53:56] set up a Satan's Eden he has set up a a
[53:59] government he set up a a way of of
[54:02] worship he set up a a culture that
[54:05] worships Satan how many know that today
[54:08] brother random preached the sermon
[54:10] Satan's Eden he said he set up an Eden
[54:12] to sin in and and he realizes that every
[54:15] son and daughter of God has the
[54:18] potential to break out and overcome and
[54:22] to actually overthrow his kingdom and so
[54:25] he's watching every time he knows the
[54:27] potential potential of it and so that's
[54:29] why Italian knowing the potential
[54:31] knowing the blood that ran through their
[54:33] veins knowing where they come from
[54:35] knowing who their their parents were
[54:38] they she tried her best to destroy them
[54:40] don't you realize Satan today he's after
[54:43] our homes he's after our children he's
[54:45] after you and I he's he's coming after
[54:48] you because he knows the potential that
[54:51] you have to be children of God to be
[54:53] Sons and Daughters of the king Satan
[54:56] knows the potential of these young men
[54:57] he knows the potential of these young
[54:59] ladies so what's he going to do he's
[55:01] going to do everything he can
[55:03] to keep them away from the Lord
[55:06] and how is he going to do that by the JT
[55:08] the the way that he the main way he can
[55:11] do that one of the ways that he can do
[55:13] that I should say is to keep him out of
[55:15] the house of God
[55:19] there's a culture today that that their
[55:22] children are not hid in the house of the
[55:25] Lord anymore
[55:26] but they're left to their own devices
[55:29] and I would say to you today that it's
[55:32] an antichrist spirit
[55:34] and I'm not calling any person
[55:36] Antichrist but it's the age we're all
[55:38] dealing with I want you to know what
[55:39] you're fighting today I'm not preaching
[55:41] at you but I want you to know what
[55:42] you're fighting there's a real devil out
[55:44] there that wants to try to take your
[55:46] children away wants to try to make them
[55:48] where they'll never become a youth group
[55:49] they'll never become why because they're
[55:51] they weren't hid in the house of the
[55:54] Lord
[55:54] but we have God he told us how to take
[55:57] care of our children
[55:59] he told us how to do those things and
[56:01] but Satan he wants to get in and get at
[56:04] them and and so we again as we begin
[56:06] talking about a home and what it should
[56:08] be and how it should be happy and how it
[56:10] should be nice and how we should keep it
[56:11] for our children that's what we ought to
[56:13] do but now when it comes to the house of
[56:15] the Lord what's he going to try to do
[56:17] first he's going to try to keep you from
[56:18] going and then if he tries to give you
[56:21] if he can't keep you from going he's
[56:22] going to try to make it just a form of
[56:24] godliness
[56:25] a form of worship a formal dead cold
[56:27] formal worship if he can't do that he'll
[56:30] try to make it some kind of fanaticism
[56:31] and get you off of the word if he can't
[56:34] do that he'll try to do everything that
[56:36] he can to keep your focus off the word
[56:38] while you're hearing while you're here
[56:41] he works on all of us don't it
[56:44] some of us are in church every time the
[56:46] doors are open and he still works
[56:47] against us
[56:49] to try to keep our minds out of the
[56:51] house of God
[56:52] keep our hearts from receiving why
[56:56] because he knows the potential
[56:59] I hope you're hearing me this morning he
[57:01] knows the potential of one service
[57:07] Satan knows that better than you do
[57:10] he knows the potential of one service
[57:12] notice that when Jesus left the earth
[57:14] when he ascended there was over 500
[57:16] people yeah watched him ascend but Satan
[57:20] knowing the potential
[57:23] oh god of people that would be gathered
[57:27] together obeying God's instructions in
[57:30] an upper room knowing the potential of
[57:32] people in one Accord in one place don't
[57:35] undersell the house of God today let's
[57:37] not understand it let's not let's not
[57:39] just make it something oh we can do it
[57:40] or we might not be able to do it no
[57:42] saying knows the potential of that he
[57:44] knows what it oh God if we can just
[57:46] realize the potential that comes with
[57:48] every service this today might be your
[57:50] healing today might be your deliverance
[57:52] today might be the day that you receive
[57:55] something
[57:56] Eternal from God
[57:58] hey man you said well I could get that
[57:59] at home yes you could but this is God's
[58:01] provided way
[58:03] gathering together and they knew oh God
[58:06] Satan knew that he that they were about
[58:09] to receive something so he did
[58:10] everything he could
[58:13] and he managed to succeed with some of
[58:15] them
[58:16] because 500 saw him go up physically saw
[58:19] him ascend
[58:21] and only 120 went to church that day
[58:24] all right
[58:26] think about it
[58:29] this is not a minor thing it's life and
[58:31] death
[58:33] and I realized that you make it a law
[58:36] and that again it becomes a trap of the
[58:39] devil because then it becomes a force
[58:42] we don't force ourselves even
[58:45] it ought to be something we want to do
[58:48] it ought to be a desire in our heart
[58:50] to feed on the word you don't have to
[58:52] force Eagles to feed on the fresh kill
[58:54] of the word
[58:55] right you don't have to do that and so
[58:57] it should never be a force because when
[58:58] it's a force then it becomes a tradition
[59:01] and it's just a family tradition it's
[59:03] just something we do but we need we want
[59:05] to be hit in the house of God
[59:07] because we know the potential of our
[59:09] children
[59:11] you hear me today we know the potential
[59:13] of this church and you you may not see
[59:15] it but there's potential the Lord left
[59:18] us here for a reason we're here in 2022
[59:21] for a reason
[59:22] we weren't just set here to be bumps on
[59:25] pickles and wait out to come no we're
[59:27] here for a reason we're in Hardy
[59:28] Arkansas for a reason but so God left
[59:31] you here puts you here for a reason
[59:32] sister Joanne he left you here for a
[59:34] reason God allows you to be here for a
[59:37] reason he put brother Joel here for a
[59:39] reason each one of you for a reason
[59:41] what did he he knows the potential God
[59:43] knows the potential the devil knows the
[59:45] potential do you realize the potential
[59:47] today
[59:51] he knows what this service could do
[59:54] now joash was hid in the house of God to
[59:57] keep a Thalia from destroying him it was
[59:59] life and death
[1:00:01] and the scripture tells us and I think
[1:00:03] I've always kind of misunderstood this
[1:00:05] scripture in Hebrews 10 25.
[1:00:09] because I've always taken this as being
[1:00:13] not forsaking the assembling of
[1:00:14] ourselves together as the man or
[1:00:15] something is but exhorting one another
[1:00:16] and so much the more as you see the day
[1:00:18] approaching I've always taken the last
[1:00:20] part of that as so much the more to we
[1:00:23] should get together more
[1:00:25] but that's not actually what he's saying
[1:00:28] if you read it and think about it he's
[1:00:30] actually saying not to have more
[1:00:31] services although that would be a good
[1:00:33] thing
[1:00:34] all right but but that's not what he's
[1:00:36] saying he's not saying don't have more
[1:00:38] services what's he saying so much the
[1:00:40] more exhort one another more
[1:00:44] right as you see the day approaching
[1:00:46] exhort one another to be in the house of
[1:00:48] the Lord more as you see the day
[1:00:50] approaching now why does he want you to
[1:00:52] exhort one another more because Paul
[1:00:54] being a prophet could see that as the
[1:00:56] end time Drew near there would be a
[1:00:58] great falling away and there would be a
[1:01:00] great lack of desire and there would be
[1:01:02] a great cooling off and there would be a
[1:01:03] great lukewarmness take over the world
[1:01:05] and so there would come a time at the
[1:01:07] end of the age when even good people
[1:01:09] would not would just somehow lose the
[1:01:12] joy of the Lord the Salvation that the
[1:01:14] joy of their salvation and they would
[1:01:15] they would go back they would draw back
[1:01:17] from the house of the Lord and he knew
[1:01:19] there would be so many false prophets
[1:01:20] and so many ravening wolves and so many
[1:01:23] false churches they hear me this morning
[1:01:24] that the devil would use that to keep
[1:01:27] the people use it as scarecrows to keep
[1:01:29] the people out of the house of God so he
[1:01:31] said when you get near the end time
[1:01:33] exhort one another more to be in the
[1:01:35] house of the Lord
[1:01:37] are you with me now
[1:01:40] something about these times
[1:01:42] makes it even more necessary
[1:01:45] for us to assemble
[1:01:47] together because athalia the queen
[1:01:50] who calls herself the Queen of Heaven
[1:01:53] ahab's daughter
[1:01:55] that lukewarm Church religion is in the
[1:01:59] land
[1:02:02] that's the ruler of the of the land that
[1:02:05] we're living in now
[1:02:06] he said well it's the president it's
[1:02:08] just one of that one no it's salute it's
[1:02:09] Italian it's that Spirit we're waiting
[1:02:12] on Sunday well someday Catholicism will
[1:02:14] take over it already has
[1:02:17] in ecumenicalism
[1:02:20] it already has the church has gone back
[1:02:22] to their mother even the Pentecostal the
[1:02:24] charismatic church has went back
[1:02:26] literally to Rome and make declared
[1:02:28] themselves one with Rome
[1:02:30] where are we at church
[1:02:32] we're living in a day when there's no
[1:02:34] fire anywhere there's no there's no joy
[1:02:36] anywhere there's no power anywhere there
[1:02:38] must there's only there's only life in
[1:02:40] one place and that's in the grain
[1:02:43] it's the hour we're living in
[1:02:46] it's life or death
[1:02:48] oh god oh as a father I want to hide my
[1:02:52] children in the house of the Lord don't
[1:02:54] you ask parents let's hide them in the
[1:02:56] house of the Lord let's stay in the
[1:02:58] house of the Lord and and I realize
[1:03:00] there's things many things that'll keep
[1:03:01] us out but we should exhort each other
[1:03:03] more
[1:03:05] as we see the day approaching
[1:03:08] something about these times
[1:03:11] makes it more necessary II Timothy three
[1:03:13] and one this snow also in the last days
[1:03:15] perilous times shall come
[1:03:18] for men shall be lovers of their own
[1:03:20] selves
[1:03:21] boy we could stop for a while on that
[1:03:23] covet just posters proud blasphemers
[1:03:26] disobedient to parents I'm thankful
[1:03:28] Unholy Traders heady high-minded lovers
[1:03:32] of pleasure
[1:03:33] more than lovers of God and that's uh he
[1:03:36] goes on to say they have a form of
[1:03:38] godliness but deny the power thereof
[1:03:40] but today brother random says that he
[1:03:43] interprets that this way he said today
[1:03:44] we're getting so slothful the church is
[1:03:47] getting so worldly and so indifferent
[1:03:49] and their mind's so muddled up with
[1:03:51] television and we love Lucy and some of
[1:03:54] these old things and staying home
[1:03:57] right so that he's watching the desire
[1:04:00] of the people and brother Branham hits
[1:04:01] this over and over and over and over
[1:04:03] again on the message
[1:04:05] it's this one particular television show
[1:04:07] over and over again but it was
[1:04:09] emblematic of an age
[1:04:12] that was losing their desire to come to
[1:04:14] the house of the Lord and they had more
[1:04:16] of a desire to watch We Love Lucy which
[1:04:18] is a pretty terrible TV show
[1:04:21] I mean there's really not that much bad
[1:04:22] about it it's just terrible
[1:04:26] boy I like the fact he never mentioned
[1:04:28] the Andy Griffith Show
[1:04:34] but the truth is he's talking about
[1:04:36] loving those things
[1:04:39] more than you love God
[1:04:42] so there's something about this age
[1:04:45] are you hear me now Paul's telling us
[1:04:46] something about this age people are
[1:04:48] going to be loversed of pleasure more
[1:04:50] than lovers of God
[1:04:51] and he said so muddled up with
[1:04:53] television and staying home he said that
[1:04:55] shows where the people's hearts are
[1:04:57] and you can tell them these things are
[1:04:59] wrong and they think you're crazy what
[1:05:01] is it love it's a pleasure more than
[1:05:03] lovers of God he said oh the greatest
[1:05:05] pleasure I know of oh God where do we
[1:05:08] find our pleasure today he said the
[1:05:10] greatest pleasure I know of is to pray
[1:05:12] until I can realize I'm in the presence
[1:05:14] of God and recognize it how long has it
[1:05:18] been since you prayed until you knew you
[1:05:20] were in the presence of God and you
[1:05:22] recognized it he said I think that ought
[1:05:24] to be the thrill of the church
[1:05:26] is the presence of the Holy Spirit
[1:05:29] oh don't you want that to be your thrill
[1:05:31] this morning oh my heart just ignites
[1:05:33] sometimes when I come up here and I feel
[1:05:35] the presence of God and the people
[1:05:37] worshiping what is it that ought to be
[1:05:39] the thrill of the church it's the
[1:05:40] presence of the Holy Spirit more than
[1:05:42] any ball game more than any any workout
[1:05:44] more than any emotion but the thrill of
[1:05:46] the church is his presence being right
[1:05:49] here with us
[1:05:50] that ought to make our hearts happy
[1:05:52] ought to make us want to come to the
[1:05:53] house of God ought to make us rejoice
[1:05:55] when we're in the house of God
[1:05:57] it's a thrill of the church
[1:06:00] oh my
[1:06:01] sometimes it takes your breath away
[1:06:04] oh
[1:06:05] that you would come
[1:06:07] and be among us
[1:06:11] but it gets so common to us
[1:06:14] that's the thrill of the the ought to be
[1:06:16] the thrill of the church
[1:06:19] seeing the god
[1:06:20] that made the promise
[1:06:22] standing Among Us
[1:06:25] feel his presence
[1:06:27] and see his word and see it Vindicated
[1:06:31] it ought to give faith to make cripples
[1:06:34] walk
[1:06:35] blind sea death here dumb speak
[1:06:40] he said well I'll go to a meeting and
[1:06:42] then that'll happen no that ought to be
[1:06:43] the presence of God in the church
[1:06:48] brother Branham taught us to take our
[1:06:50] children to church I won't read
[1:06:51] everything just to but there's quotes
[1:06:54] for all of these things he taught us to
[1:06:55] take our children to church he taught us
[1:06:56] it's because I preached way too long
[1:06:58] last week so I'm trying I'm doing my
[1:07:00] best today
[1:07:01] but brother random taught us to take our
[1:07:03] children to church he taught us to sin
[1:07:05] to send your children to Sunday school
[1:07:07] right you've heard him say that he said
[1:07:09] you need to take them he taught that you
[1:07:11] can miss work but don't miss church
[1:07:14] so brother random taught that he said if
[1:07:16] you do have to miss work once in a while
[1:07:18] that won't hurt
[1:07:19] he said because work that's just your
[1:07:21] daily bread he said the Lord promised to
[1:07:23] provide that he said but you must really
[1:07:25] be sure to come to church
[1:07:27] and and again I believe that going to
[1:07:29] the house of God should be a The Thrill
[1:07:31] of the church it shouldn't be like going
[1:07:33] to the dentist
[1:07:35] right right and sometimes it's us
[1:07:38] preachers that make it like that you
[1:07:40] know and
[1:07:42] man we gotta go get a tooth pulled today
[1:07:46] and going to the house of God shouldn't
[1:07:48] be like that shouldn't
[1:07:50] shouldn't be like that I know there's
[1:07:52] things that we deal with and things that
[1:07:54] hurt us and sometimes I watch people
[1:07:56] something will happen and for years
[1:07:57] they're impacted in church because they
[1:08:01] there's there's a heaviness on them
[1:08:03] because they've had a loss or suffered
[1:08:05] in their life in some way or or they've
[1:08:08] been betrayed in some way and there's a
[1:08:09] heaviness there but we shouldn't come to
[1:08:11] the house of God like we're going to the
[1:08:13] dentist
[1:08:14] we shouldn't go like oh I'm going to get
[1:08:16] a tooth pulled today man uh you know
[1:08:18] when you go to the dentist you don't
[1:08:20] want to show up too early you got to
[1:08:21] hear them pull all the other people's
[1:08:23] teeth and and you try everything you can
[1:08:26] to get out of it and any little excuse
[1:08:28] you you can use you try to get out of
[1:08:30] going to the dentist but that's not the
[1:08:31] way Church ought to be to us
[1:08:33] brother bear said the holy spirit will
[1:08:35] bring forth a holy life he said and if
[1:08:37] the desire is in your heart if you have
[1:08:39] to force yourself constantly to try to
[1:08:41] press and do what's right the world is
[1:08:44] still hungering in you and there's
[1:08:45] something wrong
[1:08:47] he said the Holy Spirit and you will not
[1:08:49] hunger for the world it will hunger for
[1:08:51] God oh I'm telling you today church if
[1:08:53] you stop short maybe he's repented and
[1:08:55] you've been baptized and you believe but
[1:08:57] there's you stop short and there's
[1:08:59] something there you can tell there's
[1:09:00] still a hunger for the world you still
[1:09:02] you don't have that desire to be in the
[1:09:04] house of God it's time to check up
[1:09:05] there's more for you
[1:09:07] Now's the Time to come to an altar Now's
[1:09:10] the Time to to seek for God seek for him
[1:09:12] at home seek for him in the word why
[1:09:15] would you want to seek for him because
[1:09:16] you know there's something missing
[1:09:18] and I would say to those of us who've
[1:09:21] had the Holy Ghost and we believe but
[1:09:22] every once in a while we get a little
[1:09:24] bit cold and we get our Eagle Eye gets
[1:09:26] filmed over we get to a place where we
[1:09:28] don't feel safe no more and that's fine
[1:09:30] you're safe whether you feel saved or
[1:09:31] not right you're saved before the
[1:09:34] foundation of the world really God but
[1:09:36] God saved you before the fact one day
[1:09:37] you found out you were saved but now
[1:09:39] your Eagle Eye gets filled over and you
[1:09:41] begin to not want it filmed over you
[1:09:43] don't want to go to church anymore what
[1:09:44] do you do during that time go find The
[1:09:46] Rock
[1:09:48] and beat your head against the rock
[1:09:50] until the until all the old crusts and
[1:09:52] all the old junk of the world begins to
[1:09:54] fall off of you that's the time to go to
[1:09:56] church that's not the time to quit
[1:09:59] that's the time to be in the house of
[1:10:00] God can you say Amen this morning
[1:10:04] hey man I know some of you thought as I
[1:10:06] get older I'm gonna gonna gonna settle
[1:10:09] down a little bit but it ain't gonna
[1:10:10] happen
[1:10:11] not yet anyway
[1:10:14] now maybe if I get any fatter it might
[1:10:19] [Laughter]
[1:10:22] you can laugh it's all right
[1:10:25] what is the Holy Spirit what will it do
[1:10:28] it'll make you hunger for God
[1:10:32] what a dangerous thing if that hunger's
[1:10:34] not there
[1:10:36] Church you realize
[1:10:39] that if the dove flies to the Gable end
[1:10:42] of your souls brother Branham put it so
[1:10:43] poetically
[1:10:45] there's no difference
[1:10:47] in what this flesh wants then if he's
[1:10:50] not there at all
[1:10:52] see if he's lost his influence on you
[1:10:55] I hope you hear me this flesh is still
[1:10:58] capable of everything
[1:11:00] it's still capable of Deceit
[1:11:03] lies
[1:11:05] huh
[1:11:06] sexual sin
[1:11:08] don't you ever think that your flesh is
[1:11:10] not capable
[1:11:12] it's still capable even with the Holy
[1:11:14] Ghost
[1:11:15] but because that influence lifts off of
[1:11:17] your life
[1:11:18] we need to pray
[1:11:20] if there's not if there's no hunger for
[1:11:22] the house of God there's no hunger for
[1:11:24] the word of God no hunger to read our
[1:11:26] Bibles and to pray we need to get down
[1:11:28] to business with God
[1:11:30] we need to reach a place in our heart
[1:11:32] where we you know when you say brother
[1:11:34] Ben you shouldn't talk like that you
[1:11:35] shouldn't preach at us like that but but
[1:11:37] if I don't who's going to
[1:11:39] this is this is my this is my job God
[1:11:42] put me here for a reason not just to
[1:11:44] tickle people's ears but to tell you the
[1:11:46] truth
[1:11:47] if it's hard you have to force yourself
[1:11:49] constantly to go to church and we
[1:11:50] realize there's a flesh and a spirit and
[1:11:52] a soul and you realize that from your
[1:11:54] soul you want to serve God but the flesh
[1:11:56] you don't want to but you push your way
[1:11:58] through it you feel tired but you do it
[1:12:00] anyway but when you get to the point
[1:12:01] where you can't you hardly feel the
[1:12:03] influence of that Soul that's the time
[1:12:05] you need a prayer meeting
[1:12:07] you need to talk to God because the holy
[1:12:09] spirit in you will not hunger for the
[1:12:11] world
[1:12:12] it'll hunger for God
[1:12:14] he said if it's hard for you to go to
[1:12:16] church and press yourself to come when
[1:12:18] the church is open there's something
[1:12:19] wrong with that spirit it's trying to
[1:12:22] keep you away from God the spirit of God
[1:12:24] will run you right straight to the
[1:12:26] church every time the church door opens
[1:12:28] for fellowship and we can talk about
[1:12:30] everybody else all we want to and and
[1:12:32] talk about those who have taken the
[1:12:33] pastor out of the church and taken the
[1:12:35] church out of the church and and set
[1:12:37] people to where they're doing communion
[1:12:38] alone and everything like that we know
[1:12:40] that's false it's Antichrist in this
[1:12:43] sense that it's anti-word
[1:12:45] right it's against the word and not
[1:12:48] calling the people Antichrist but it's
[1:12:50] anti-word we know the word teaches
[1:12:52] against that we know better than that
[1:12:54] but don't you think the devil's going to
[1:12:55] try to get you too what did Nathalia do
[1:12:58] she tried to destroy all the seed Royal
[1:13:01] they're trying to destroy all the sons
[1:13:03] of God the spirit of the age is trying
[1:13:05] to come on you too and it's trying to
[1:13:07] keep you out of the house of God and the
[1:13:09] devil don't care why you're missing
[1:13:10] Church
[1:13:13] he just cares if you miss that
[1:13:14] opportunity there's a economic principle
[1:13:17] and I don't understand much about
[1:13:18] economics I know brother Allen could
[1:13:19] help me but there's an economic
[1:13:21] principle it's called I believe it's
[1:13:22] called opportunity lost
[1:13:24] and it's the idea that that when you do
[1:13:27] something if you spend your money on one
[1:13:28] thing maybe you could have spent your
[1:13:30] money on another investment and made
[1:13:31] more money
[1:13:33] the devil wants you to miss
[1:13:35] the opportunity
[1:13:37] of being in the house of God
[1:13:40] are you with me now
[1:13:41] yeah well I'm still a Christian yes you
[1:13:43] are but the devil wants you to miss that
[1:13:45] growth
[1:13:46] every year in the Old Testament when the
[1:13:49] when the Philistines would come in you
[1:13:51] remember against shamgar
[1:13:52] they would come in against shamgar every
[1:13:54] year and every year the Bible says that
[1:13:57] they came to destroy the increase of the
[1:14:00] land
[1:14:00] and the Bible tells us that during the
[1:14:02] days of shamgar the roads were empty
[1:14:05] because the people were so afraid of
[1:14:08] coming out on the open road
[1:14:10] oh God they were so afraid of walking on
[1:14:13] the highway walking on the open road so
[1:14:15] they hid themselves in their houses and
[1:14:18] every year they would plant a crop
[1:14:19] Faithfully they would do what they were
[1:14:21] supposed to do but every year the
[1:14:23] Philistines would come right back in and
[1:14:25] steal the increase
[1:14:26] the Philistines wanted them to work they
[1:14:30] wanted them to plant they were okay with
[1:14:32] them doing those things
[1:14:34] but they just took the increase don't
[1:14:36] you realize that's the way the devil
[1:14:37] wants to do in your life he wants to
[1:14:39] take away the increase but what happened
[1:14:41] to shamgar shamgar one day got fed up
[1:14:43] with it because he saw the condition of
[1:14:45] his children he saw the condition of his
[1:14:48] family he saw the condition of the
[1:14:49] church and he said I'm not going to
[1:14:51] stand for that I'm not going to let my
[1:14:53] family not get fed are you with me now
[1:14:55] I'm not going to let my family stay out
[1:14:58] of the house of God I'm not going to let
[1:15:00] my family you say well I may have to
[1:15:01] move brother Ben then move
[1:15:03] I might have to I may have to change
[1:15:06] some things change some things hide your
[1:15:08] children in the house of the Lord
[1:15:11] huh I'm not trying to control you today
[1:15:14] you do what you want to but at least
[1:15:15] I've preached the word
[1:15:18] are you with me now
[1:15:20] hide your children in the house of the
[1:15:22] Lord
[1:15:23] every time the door opens for Fellowship
[1:15:25] there's got to be something in your
[1:15:26] heart I know some of you can't come
[1:15:27] every service I realize that but every
[1:15:29] time you want to yeah
[1:15:31] yeah you want to there's something in
[1:15:33] your heart
[1:15:34] don't stay home
[1:15:36] if God is in your heart you can't hardly
[1:15:37] wait for them doors to open out yonder
[1:15:39] to get in here to fellowship with your
[1:15:41] brothers he said if you don't feel that
[1:15:43] way I tell you it's time you got to
[1:15:45] praying
[1:15:48] rather got tired of them coming every
[1:15:51] year and destroying the crops over and
[1:15:53] over and over again so what did he do he
[1:15:55] picked up the only Implement of war that
[1:15:57] he had he had an ox goad and the Bible
[1:16:00] says that the Philistines took all the
[1:16:02] swords out of the Land There wasn't even
[1:16:03] a sword Smith in the land but they had a
[1:16:06] they left him a file to sharpen the
[1:16:07] goads with
[1:16:09] so that year what Cham guard did is he
[1:16:11] sharpened that goad he got it so sharp
[1:16:14] he jumped out of the window in the power
[1:16:17] of God when that when those 600
[1:16:19] Philistines come by his way he jumps out
[1:16:21] of the window grabs an ox goat and
[1:16:23] killed 600 Philistines at one time why
[1:16:25] was he able to do it because he got fed
[1:16:27] up with the current condition he said
[1:16:29] Lord today we're going to have church
[1:16:31] today we're going to go to the house of
[1:16:32] God today me and my family is going to
[1:16:34] serve the Lord
[1:16:36] we're tired of being leftovers for the
[1:16:39] devil
[1:16:40] tired of working every year and then the
[1:16:43] devil's stealing it away are you with me
[1:16:45] this morning
[1:16:46] I wish some of us would get tired of
[1:16:48] every year the devil steals away our joy
[1:16:50] steals away our peace steals the way
[1:16:52] everything that we've got it's time to
[1:16:54] jump out of the window and say devil you
[1:16:57] don't have a right to my life you don't
[1:16:59] have a right to my family I'm a son of
[1:17:01] God
[1:17:01] [Music]
[1:17:03] all right
[1:17:04] are you hearing me this morning
[1:17:10] brother random talks about the deer
[1:17:12] he said they got separated from the herd
[1:17:15] talks about young people
[1:17:17] talks about how they'll get married and
[1:17:19] separate from the church don't let that
[1:17:22] be you
[1:17:23] huh marry somebody in the house of God
[1:17:25] so proud of our youth for doing that and
[1:17:27] but where is somebody in the house of
[1:17:29] God
[1:17:30] or it won't separate you from the place
[1:17:32] of worship
[1:17:34] but then he goes on he said to you old
[1:17:35] man or woman
[1:17:37] when you separate yourself from
[1:17:38] believers
[1:17:40] people say I can stay at home be just as
[1:17:42] good a Christian as I can at church you
[1:17:43] can't
[1:17:45] and people come and tell me brother
[1:17:47] Brandon I believe every word that
[1:17:48] Prophet said do you believe that
[1:17:51] because you're going to be judged by
[1:17:53] that
[1:17:56] are you hearing me today
[1:17:58] he said you can't if you're a Christian
[1:18:01] you long to go where other Christians
[1:18:02] are and fellowship with other Christians
[1:18:05] so you cannot stay away from church and
[1:18:07] live the same life
[1:18:10] now what's he telling you if you stay
[1:18:12] away from church in this hour as you see
[1:18:14] the day approaching if you stay away
[1:18:16] from church Italians in the land she's
[1:18:18] reigning over the land and she's looking
[1:18:20] for your children
[1:18:21] she's looking for you she wants to
[1:18:24] destroy she wants to kill she wants to
[1:18:27] take him out of the house of God put him
[1:18:28] out in some nominal church somewhere
[1:18:30] where there's just just a bunch of
[1:18:32] carrying on but she wants to keep them
[1:18:34] away from this word that can make their
[1:18:36] lives the way they ought to be
[1:18:37] she wants to take you the same way
[1:18:40] what's the answer for that hide me in
[1:18:43] the house of the Lord
[1:18:44] and there's a deeper revelation of that
[1:18:46] Beyond just going to church but
[1:18:48] sometimes we we can't see the forest for
[1:18:50] the trees we get so lost in the depth of
[1:18:52] it we can't see that that we we really
[1:18:54] need to be just be in church
[1:18:56] obey God but then there's beyond that
[1:18:58] there's a deeper Revelation in the
[1:19:00] seventh seal where he talks about being
[1:19:02] hid in the presence of God hid in the
[1:19:04] Tabernacle of the Lord in the secret of
[1:19:06] his Tabernacle what are we in this age
[1:19:08] we're hid Away by God we're hid like
[1:19:10] joash was hid away in the secrets of God
[1:19:13] hit away oh God let me be hid there even
[1:19:16] when I'm not in church even when I'm not
[1:19:17] around Believers let me be hid
[1:19:20] because there's trouble in the land let
[1:19:22] me be hidden The Secret of his coming
[1:19:25] oh God
[1:19:26] oh Hallelujah
[1:19:29] cannot stay away from church and live
[1:19:32] the same life
[1:19:35] you can't do it
[1:19:36] because it's like I'm hungry but I'll
[1:19:39] never go to a table
[1:19:41] I'll never eat I ain't gonna do it
[1:19:43] you got to go and feed on the word of
[1:19:45] God and fellowship one with another
[1:19:48] amen
[1:19:51] some people say that's changed
[1:19:54] we can watch online
[1:19:56] just watch it we got if every person
[1:19:58] that was watching some other church
[1:19:59] somewhere else from I'm not condemning
[1:20:01] the other church not condemning the
[1:20:03] person either it just says what it is we
[1:20:04] need to obey God
[1:20:06] if every person in this area that loved
[1:20:09] said they loved God and loved this
[1:20:10] message and watched church services from
[1:20:12] a thousand miles away would just go to a
[1:20:14] local church I don't even care which one
[1:20:19] this would be the strongest area in this
[1:20:21] message for for the message of the hour
[1:20:25] just go and put your shoulders to the
[1:20:26] wheel well there's Hypocrites there will
[1:20:28] you still go to Walmart
[1:20:32] you still go to the gas station
[1:20:34] you go to that old gas station sometimes
[1:20:36] and it's smelly you go to that gas
[1:20:39] station you know if you really if you
[1:20:40] really need a drink of water and you're
[1:20:42] traveling down the road you really need
[1:20:43] gas in your car you may go in the
[1:20:45] dirtiest filthiest old nasty gas station
[1:20:47] and you may go and have to pump your gas
[1:20:49] and walk isn't that terrible when you
[1:20:50] have to pump your gas and walk inside
[1:20:52] pay for it and we're all used to paying
[1:20:54] by credit card now and and I'll pass up
[1:20:57] gas stations sometimes because they
[1:20:58] don't have a way to pay outside but
[1:21:00] sometimes you got to go in even before
[1:21:01] you pump your gas and pay and it's dirty
[1:21:03] and it's filthy and it's nasty but if
[1:21:05] you're out of gas you got to get gas you
[1:21:08] don't care whether there's Hypocrites
[1:21:09] there or not you don't care what's going
[1:21:11] on you've been out of the house of God
[1:21:12] you need to get back in the place where
[1:21:14] the gasoline is
[1:21:16] back in the presence of God
[1:21:22] I'll just stay home and listen to a
[1:21:24] prophet can't get a better preacher than
[1:21:25] that but you can't fulfill the word and
[1:21:27] do that either
[1:21:28] you can't do what a prophet said
[1:21:36] I gotta quit apologizing and preach
[1:21:39] or I'm not gonna get through this
[1:21:41] we need one another more now brother
[1:21:43] Brandon said you said well that's
[1:21:44] changed this is what a prophet said we
[1:21:46] need one another more now than we ever
[1:21:48] did need each other that's right
[1:21:50] is now
[1:21:51] he said when you get yourself singled
[1:21:53] out from the rest of them making
[1:21:54] yourself just a little different you
[1:21:55] don't want to associate with them
[1:21:56] because they believe this and don't want
[1:21:58] to associate with that you're getting on
[1:22:00] Dangerous Ground right then keeping away
[1:22:03] from church
[1:22:05] find that one of your choice and remain
[1:22:09] there and be a Christian brother to all
[1:22:12] of them
[1:22:15] shouldn't that be our desire shouldn't
[1:22:17] that be the rule rather than the
[1:22:19] exception
[1:22:21] I've had people tell me and say brother
[1:22:22] Ben you go to the different meetings and
[1:22:24] fellowship why that's why how can you do
[1:22:26] that and I'll tell them that that's just
[1:22:29] what I do I did that before I was a
[1:22:31] pastor I want a fellowship with God's
[1:22:33] people why why would why would having
[1:22:35] this position keep me from
[1:22:36] fellowshipping with God's people
[1:22:39] hi and there's something if we're
[1:22:41] careful not careful we'll get off to
[1:22:43] ourselves and we begin to preach a
[1:22:45] gospel where I'm the only one that's
[1:22:46] right and no one else is and and pretty
[1:22:49] soon what you do is you tied to people
[1:22:50] so to you that if something happened to
[1:22:52] you that people would have nowhere to go
[1:22:55] right nobody to turn to cause you made
[1:22:58] everybody else false
[1:23:00] find one of your choice and remain there
[1:23:03] and be a Christian brother to all of
[1:23:05] them he said that's the way to be a real
[1:23:07] Christian and we want to be a real
[1:23:08] Christian today
[1:23:10] he said then we've got Fellowship
[1:23:11] protection people love you and pray for
[1:23:13] you
[1:23:15] that's notice brother Abraham says
[1:23:17] that's the success of my meetings it's
[1:23:19] because real godly people
[1:23:21] pray for me
[1:23:25] it gives you a boost doesn't it
[1:23:27] gives you a boost this morning we don't
[1:23:30] usually have prayer before we come out
[1:23:32] but this morning I felt like we needed
[1:23:33] to pray because this quote was in my
[1:23:34] mind I thought oh God we prayed before
[1:23:37] we come out before brother came out the
[1:23:39] first time we prayed
[1:23:41] and
[1:23:42] so but as we're praying you know people
[1:23:44] godly people are praying for you I value
[1:23:46] brother Stewart's prayer
[1:23:48] brother David's prayer brother Joel's
[1:23:50] prayer brother the Island's prayer
[1:23:51] brothers are usually sometimes back
[1:23:52] there with me I want them to be praying
[1:23:54] for me
[1:23:55] as I'm preaching brother said that's the
[1:23:58] success of my Ministry real godly people
[1:24:00] pray for me I know some of you pray for
[1:24:02] me I want to encourage you today keep
[1:24:04] doing it don't just pray for me pray for
[1:24:06] the church pray for each individual in
[1:24:08] the church pray for the other churches
[1:24:10] pray for the other pastors again if they
[1:24:12] come to your mind as you have time pray
[1:24:14] for each one why we need it
[1:24:17] success if we're going to have success
[1:24:19] in our ministry today as a five-fold
[1:24:21] Ministry we need those prayers
[1:24:25] real godly people praying for me
[1:24:28] keep doing that you're not useless if
[1:24:30] you're praying
[1:24:32] don't you never let the devil tell you
[1:24:33] that so I'm old I've gotten old and I'm
[1:24:36] off to myself and nobody really thinks
[1:24:38] about me anymore you're not useless if
[1:24:39] you're praying
[1:24:41] you may be all by yourself but God's
[1:24:44] with you and if you'll pray you're a
[1:24:46] child of God if you'll pray Heaven's
[1:24:47] will shake
[1:24:49] the Devils Tremble When one faint of God
[1:24:51] gets down on their knees do we believe
[1:24:52] that today
[1:24:54] he said
[1:24:56] brother Branham
[1:24:57] when he was in uh in
[1:25:00] Arizona
[1:25:02] it was in the desert he went out there
[1:25:04] not to start a church because he wanted
[1:25:06] to minister all the churches but in
[1:25:09] Tucson where he was none of them would
[1:25:10] have him
[1:25:11] and so his family got out of church
[1:25:14] but the brand was traveling and
[1:25:15] preaching still he preached in Phoenix
[1:25:16] during that time back in Jeffersonville
[1:25:18] but his family got out of church
[1:25:22] and if you want to see what happens when
[1:25:25] you get out of church brother Branham
[1:25:27] tells us what happened to him and to his
[1:25:30] family when they got out of church
[1:25:32] and so brother brand of mine I think
[1:25:34] it's comical sometimes because if you
[1:25:35] ask different people you get different
[1:25:37] stories about who brother Branham asked
[1:25:39] to go to Tucson but brother Branham is
[1:25:42] desperate to get a pastor in Tucson and
[1:25:44] it didn't seem like he was that picky
[1:25:47] because he asked three or four men
[1:25:50] to go to Tucson and start a church
[1:25:55] and the reason was because he felt the
[1:25:58] people getting cold
[1:26:03] this is what he says he said I know that
[1:26:04] each one of you like if you said if you
[1:26:07] feel like I do I'm so hungry and this is
[1:26:09] when Perry green starts the church there
[1:26:11] and Perry was was the most successful
[1:26:13] because he was independent he had the
[1:26:15] money wasn't dependent on the people he
[1:26:16] could just move there and start a church
[1:26:18] he could do that because he had the
[1:26:20] financial ability to do it but others
[1:26:22] started churches as well and there's
[1:26:24] multiple churches in Tucson today many
[1:26:26] churches
[1:26:27] but he started he had asked him to do
[1:26:29] that he said I know that each one of you
[1:26:31] if you feel like I do I'm so hungry to
[1:26:33] see the spirit of God moving I just
[1:26:35] can't hardly stand it
[1:26:37] I wonder how many of us feel that way
[1:26:39] here's a prophet of God he's seen
[1:26:42] Supernatural things beyond our even
[1:26:45] comprehension
[1:26:47] but he gets out of church for a few
[1:26:49] months
[1:26:50] and he says I'm so hungry
[1:26:52] to see the spirit of God moving I just
[1:26:55] can't hardly stand it I don't mean he
[1:26:57] was backside not going to church I mean
[1:26:58] he didn't have a home Church where they
[1:27:01] lived
[1:27:02] huh he said some experiences I've just
[1:27:06] had up in the mountain just to feel that
[1:27:08] once again
[1:27:09] that's something that when I was first
[1:27:11] Saved was So Glorious to my heart can
[1:27:14] you look back in your memory now and see
[1:27:16] what it was like at that moment when you
[1:27:18] were first Saved when you first got in
[1:27:20] contact with God and that feeling that
[1:27:23] you had brother random goes back to that
[1:27:25] moment he said I want to feel that again
[1:27:28] oh that ought to be the desire of our
[1:27:30] heart today
[1:27:31] he said So Glorious to my heart when we
[1:27:34] come into a place we can sit and we see
[1:27:35] it among us that we are drying
[1:27:38] as we sit here in the desert I get them
[1:27:40] on my brother and they talk with me and
[1:27:41] I talk with them he said always in a
[1:27:43] little way of watching feeling out there
[1:27:44] with the spirit as it was to see just
[1:27:47] the condition of that brother to see
[1:27:48] what's wrong he said I begin to feel us
[1:27:51] all reclining getting away from the
[1:27:53] spirit it's become too natural a thing
[1:27:55] to us we must Worship in the spirit he
[1:27:58] said we're the spirit of God not only
[1:27:59] our message should be the flame of the
[1:28:01] hour it should be the flame in our
[1:28:03] hearts
[1:28:04] it's got to be in our hearts so we can't
[1:28:06] rightly present it to the people the
[1:28:08] spirit has to pack the message itself
[1:28:11] he goes on later he said our young
[1:28:13] people just ride around from place to
[1:28:15] place from show to show drifting further
[1:28:17] and further away from God
[1:28:19] he said right now that's the truth he
[1:28:21] said I see it in my children I see
[1:28:24] myself getting to a place
[1:28:28] I see myself getting to a place he was a
[1:28:30] prophet of God but he said you've got to
[1:28:32] assemble ourselves together to worship
[1:28:34] God the Bible said so when we see this
[1:28:37] day approaching that much more come
[1:28:39] together
[1:28:40] there's only two people here you be one
[1:28:43] of them
[1:28:44] that's right
[1:28:46] oh my and if we come together and
[1:28:49] worship together
[1:28:50] than just something another about it
[1:28:52] Jesus said where two or three are
[1:28:54] gathered in my name there I am
[1:28:57] in their midst
[1:29:00] in the seventh year of a thalia's Reign
[1:29:02] things got so bad
[1:29:04] they got desperate
[1:29:06] for a Revival
[1:29:08] the thalia's sons had torn apart the
[1:29:10] house of God and maybe that some other
[1:29:12] time we'll get into that but everything
[1:29:14] was a mess
[1:29:15] they broke down the walls and took out
[1:29:17] all the the things that were made to
[1:29:19] serve God made them serve devils
[1:29:23] oh God
[1:29:24] and in Second Kings 11 4
[1:29:28] there had been a priest a Godly Man had
[1:29:30] been watching over joash with his wife
[1:29:33] there in the temple
[1:29:35] and they decided that in the seventh
[1:29:37] year
[1:29:38] time had run out
[1:29:40] we're going to make this young man king
[1:29:47] so they brought him into the house of
[1:29:48] the Lord and made a covenant with them
[1:29:50] and and took an oath of them in the
[1:29:51] house of the Lord and showed them the
[1:29:54] King's son
[1:29:56] I don't know about you but I've read the
[1:29:58] message of the hour and I've heard the
[1:30:00] message of the hour and what was it
[1:30:01] doing to me it was showing me Christ
[1:30:07] he was showing me the King's son
[1:30:11] and he brought forth the King's son it
[1:30:13] didn't just show it to him but he
[1:30:15] brought him forth
[1:30:17] from where he'd been hidden
[1:30:20] oh this is good this morning not because
[1:30:23] I'm preaching it because the word was
[1:30:24] good he takes the book
[1:30:27] and opens it up and brings the King's
[1:30:30] son
[1:30:30] from where he'd been hidden and put the
[1:30:33] crown upon it
[1:30:35] and gave him the testimony which is the
[1:30:37] word
[1:30:38] gave him the book
[1:30:41] and they made him King
[1:30:45] and they all sit there like bumps on
[1:30:47] pickles and set back and
[1:30:49] oh we got a king again
[1:30:54] that's not what they did
[1:30:56] but when they made him King
[1:30:58] yes sir and glory to God they anointed
[1:31:01] him and they clapped their hands and
[1:31:04] they said God Save the King
[1:31:09] you know I I was it's hard to understand
[1:31:11] the British mind
[1:31:13] you know they have a king and queen
[1:31:14] still and I have a king now and did have
[1:31:16] a queen they loved their Queen
[1:31:19] and you look at that it's kind of hard
[1:31:21] for an American to understand that
[1:31:23] and but you look at that and and the
[1:31:25] some of them people and when King
[1:31:27] Charles I don't want to say what I think
[1:31:29] about King Charles but it isn't much
[1:31:32] and King Charles
[1:31:35] you know he's an older man now he's the
[1:31:36] most of his life and probably should
[1:31:37] just abdicate and give it to his son but
[1:31:39] anyway that's my thoughts on the British
[1:31:41] Monarchy in case you wanted to know
[1:31:45] but King Charles came to the throne
[1:31:47] and I watch when they invested him with
[1:31:50] as king
[1:31:51] and people were smitten
[1:31:53] their emotions were some of them were
[1:31:55] clapping and and and excited crying
[1:32:00] God saved the king
[1:32:02] don't make any sense to us but it's not
[1:32:04] our King
[1:32:07] don't you realize that many times when
[1:32:10] it comes the house of God what are we
[1:32:12] doing we're making him King we're making
[1:32:14] him King the world may not seem as king
[1:32:17] other nations may not understand it
[1:32:19] other churches may not understand it but
[1:32:21] we're making him King and when we set
[1:32:23] him up in his proper place of
[1:32:25] preeminence in the church what do we do
[1:32:27] we clap our hands we worship we praise
[1:32:29] God God Save the King he's still here he
[1:32:32] has preeminence today
[1:32:34] Glory
[1:32:36] and he brought forth the King's son and
[1:32:39] made him King we're not here just to
[1:32:41] have a meeting today we want to Crown
[1:32:43] Him King are you with me this morning
[1:32:46] and whenever you make him King there's a
[1:32:48] lot of noise brother Brown said isn't it
[1:32:49] strange where Jesus is there's always a
[1:32:51] lot of noise he said he entered the
[1:32:53] temple one day in Jerusalem when he did
[1:32:54] they broke down palms and screamed oh my
[1:32:57] there's those those great professors of
[1:32:59] societies and Priests and said make them
[1:33:01] hold their peace he said if they hold
[1:33:02] their piece of rocks will cry out
[1:33:04] immediately see something is going to
[1:33:05] cry when he's around
[1:33:08] Glory he said you know when a man
[1:33:10] receives the baptism of fire there's a
[1:33:12] lot of noise around there
[1:33:14] they think that's a shame to hear people
[1:33:16] scream and shout like that he said but
[1:33:18] just wait till this Earth gets her
[1:33:19] baptism
[1:33:21] oh that rock so cry out the Earth will
[1:33:23] it will pass it'll be a great a great
[1:33:26] noise
[1:33:27] why
[1:33:28] something happened
[1:33:31] and the noise isn't God you understand
[1:33:33] that the noise is the response to his
[1:33:35] presence
[1:33:37] right noise can be there you can make
[1:33:39] noise and not have the presence of God
[1:33:41] but the noise is the response to his
[1:33:43] presence
[1:33:46] Second Kings 11 13. when the Thalia the
[1:33:50] queen of the h
[1:33:52] that old formal Church
[1:33:54] heard the noise
[1:33:56] of the garden of the people she came to
[1:33:59] the people into the Temple of the Lord
[1:34:02] oh my and when she looked behold the
[1:34:06] king stood by a pillar as the manner was
[1:34:08] what it was they elevated him they made
[1:34:11] him preeminent in the temple
[1:34:13] he stood by a pillar and the princes and
[1:34:16] the trumpeters by the king and all the
[1:34:18] people of the land rejoiced
[1:34:21] and blue with trumpets and Italian
[1:34:23] winter clothes
[1:34:25] and cried treason
[1:34:27] treason
[1:34:28] brother Brandon said she don't want none
[1:34:30] of them screaming hollering blabbering
[1:34:32] Acts 2 38 miserable creatures that she
[1:34:34] thinks they are it would certainly
[1:34:36] embarrass her treason
[1:34:39] let's look how second chronicles puts it
[1:34:41] second chronicles 23 12. now when
[1:34:43] Natalia heard the noise
[1:34:45] other people running
[1:34:47] oh my goodness
[1:34:51] we need to watch what Spirits were
[1:34:53] influenced by yeah
[1:34:54] yeah when Italian heard the noise of the
[1:34:57] people running and praising the king no
[1:34:59] one had to make them run you didn't have
[1:35:01] to work them up to run they ran because
[1:35:03] the King was back oh my if we could
[1:35:05] realize what age we live in and that the
[1:35:07] book is open and that the king is back
[1:35:09] in Residence there would be joy in our
[1:35:11] hearts
[1:35:13] amen and the people running and praising
[1:35:15] the king she came to the people and she
[1:35:16] looked and behold the king stood at this
[1:35:18] pillar at the entering end and the
[1:35:20] princes and the trumpets by the king and
[1:35:22] all the people of the land rejoiced and
[1:35:24] sounded with trumpets also the singers
[1:35:26] with instruments of music you say well
[1:35:27] you better be careful about having too
[1:35:29] many instruments David created
[1:35:31] instruments just to put there in the
[1:35:33] temple for times like this when the king
[1:35:35] would come and be anointed king amen and
[1:35:38] then Natalia he said also to the singers
[1:35:40] with instruments of music and such as
[1:35:42] taught to sing praise and then Nathalia
[1:35:44] rent her clothes
[1:35:46] and said treason
[1:35:47] why she didn't want a Revival in the
[1:35:49] house of God because the Revival could
[1:35:51] take away her Authority
[1:35:55] I want to spend the rest of my time
[1:35:57] on something specific here because I
[1:35:59] know in your mind you're going to think
[1:36:02] for the Ben can we even have a Revival
[1:36:06] are we even allowed
[1:36:10] to have Revival
[1:36:13] brother Branham in in the message he
[1:36:15] talks about things becoming common to
[1:36:16] the American people
[1:36:18] and if you've ever been overseas you
[1:36:20] know that and you've ever been even some
[1:36:22] parts of the country different than
[1:36:23] others
[1:36:24] it becomes common to us
[1:36:26] I wonder if that's the way it is in
[1:36:27] Hardy Arkansas
[1:36:30] burn over
[1:36:32] God help us to make him King today
[1:36:36] I heard a black preacher before I get
[1:36:38] into this I heard him preaching he did
[1:36:40] it was doing a good job not a message
[1:36:42] preacher but he was preaching in the
[1:36:44] Church of God in Christ and he he made
[1:36:47] this statement
[1:36:48] he said it's no he said he used to think
[1:36:50] it was a miracle when someone was at 400
[1:36:51] a day drug habit come out off the
[1:36:53] streets
[1:36:54] he said but now I've realized as I got
[1:36:56] older that the real Miracle is that the
[1:36:57] children the Saints of the children got
[1:36:59] saved
[1:37:01] he said because they see all that the
[1:37:02] Saints do
[1:37:06] and God still reaches down
[1:37:09] and being in the house of God becomes
[1:37:11] common
[1:37:12] oh now I've preach about going to church
[1:37:14] but be when you're in church listen
[1:37:16] brother Branham said water on a on a
[1:37:18] dead log just makes it rotten
[1:37:21] it actually makes it worse
[1:37:24] because it's just constantly pouring on
[1:37:26] a dead log we need life
[1:37:30] we need life it's not just being in
[1:37:31] church but it's what we do in church
[1:37:33] what we receive while we're there
[1:37:37] and brother Brandon talked about the
[1:37:39] American people and he said the American
[1:37:40] Revival is over
[1:37:42] he said it ended about four years ago
[1:37:44] this is in 1961. it's over that was 1956
[1:37:48] you know brother branham's teaching
[1:37:49] about that he said there's no more
[1:37:50] Revival in America
[1:37:53] we're only gleaning in the fields again
[1:37:55] in Jehovah Jireh he said the Revival is
[1:37:57] over we know that there's no more
[1:37:58] Revival Spirit Now watch how he connects
[1:38:01] this now he said two hours of service
[1:38:03] everybody is complaining
[1:38:06] well I ain't going to hear no complaints
[1:38:08] today
[1:38:12] two hours of service everybody's
[1:38:14] complaining what is it a lack of Revival
[1:38:17] you don't complain about Revival if you
[1:38:19] were part of it
[1:38:22] right and I'm not advocating long
[1:38:24] Services you know I'm not I I do my best
[1:38:28] not make it long but we're here for a
[1:38:30] reason
[1:38:31] let's get the job done while we're here
[1:38:33] we don't know how many opportunities
[1:38:34] we'll have to be here
[1:38:36] let's enter the presence of God yes
[1:38:39] let's push Beyond the Veil of the flesh
[1:38:41] yes and see where we're at
[1:38:44] he said the Revival is over we know that
[1:38:46] there's no more Revival Spirit two hours
[1:38:48] of service everybody's complaining in
[1:38:50] Revival it's day and night all the time
[1:38:51] never breaks the Revival is done we're
[1:38:53] just cleaning again he said the Revival
[1:38:56] is over and we hear not long ago he said
[1:38:58] while the Revival is burning and now it
[1:38:59] seems now watch he identifies another
[1:39:01] another attribute of Revival being over
[1:39:03] he said it seems it's kind of hard to
[1:39:05] get the church filled up
[1:39:07] the pastors tell me that it's hard
[1:39:09] nowadays Amen brother random
[1:39:12] and the people won't go to church I'm
[1:39:14] not preaching at you this morning I I
[1:39:16] again that's not what it's about I want
[1:39:18] to I want us to know what we're fighting
[1:39:21] they'd rather stay home and watch
[1:39:23] television or something the Love Has
[1:39:26] Gone out of their heart
[1:39:29] see God to a place there's no there's
[1:39:31] another sermon got to a place there's no
[1:39:33] confession
[1:39:34] another attribute of no Revival
[1:39:36] no love among the people it seems like
[1:39:39] it's dying daily church is cooling off
[1:39:41] everywhere you find the Revival is over
[1:39:43] and you find the cooling off
[1:39:47] and brother Branham goes on and talks
[1:39:49] about how anything without emotion is
[1:39:50] dead and the message perseverant and you
[1:39:52] ought to take it and bury it but he said
[1:39:54] now we are all in love with him I'm sure
[1:39:56] he said but there's a great cooling off
[1:39:58] amongst the people the Revival is over
[1:40:00] the fires is going out
[1:40:02] but watch what he says he said see it's
[1:40:04] time for something to happen yeah
[1:40:06] yeah and he goes on a quote I read the
[1:40:09] other night and he went on I didn't read
[1:40:10] that part but he went on to say when he
[1:40:12] said I just believe he said I'm just
[1:40:13] Quaker enough to believe and when the
[1:40:15] fire goes out he said you move on
[1:40:18] where did the fire go out in in the
[1:40:20] label to see an age
[1:40:23] the ones who rejected Christ he's
[1:40:25] outside the door knocking
[1:40:28] they're lukewarm they're they're
[1:40:29] miserable and blind and wretched and
[1:40:32] don't know it
[1:40:34] right that's where the Revival's gone
[1:40:35] from
[1:40:36] from the land of America it's gone
[1:40:39] I think about no more Revival
[1:40:42] I'm going to read you it part of this
[1:40:43] I've read it before but this kind of a
[1:40:45] widely abused quote
[1:40:47] sometimes we need to take some of these
[1:40:49] quotes and give them a rest because
[1:40:50] we've abused them so badly they need to
[1:40:53] go into foster care
[1:40:57] but the man said there can't be no
[1:40:59] organization left neither can can there
[1:41:01] be any further advancement than what's
[1:41:03] going right now for she'll burn before
[1:41:04] the day breaks again the Revival is over
[1:41:07] Across the Nation
[1:41:10] he didn't say there'd be no further
[1:41:12] advancement he said no further
[1:41:13] advancement except what's going on right
[1:41:14] now
[1:41:16] all right
[1:41:18] now watch he said there ain't going to
[1:41:19] be no more revivals Now watch how he
[1:41:21] qualifies it big sleeping revivals
[1:41:24] this nation never receive it
[1:41:27] but I'm not here as a nation today
[1:41:31] I didn't come to church I'm an American
[1:41:33] but I didn't come to church with an
[1:41:34] American Spirit
[1:41:36] as an American under the auspices of
[1:41:38] being an American that's not why I'm in
[1:41:40] church
[1:41:41] because many people have the right to go
[1:41:43] to church and don't
[1:41:45] they're Americans they have the right to
[1:41:46] stay home too
[1:41:48] right but that's not what makes me come
[1:41:50] to church I didn't come as an American I
[1:41:53] come as a child of God
[1:41:56] come as one who saw the message and
[1:41:58] moved on
[1:41:59] in the advancement
[1:42:01] now watch he said there ain't gonna the
[1:42:03] Revival's over he said Across the Nation
[1:42:05] there ain't going to be no more revivals
[1:42:06] big sweeping revivals this nation never
[1:42:08] receive it you might have an
[1:42:09] intellectual Gathering but I mean a
[1:42:11] spiritual Revival we've seen all of it
[1:42:13] he said I hope you're catching it I'm
[1:42:15] saying it in such a way I hope you get
[1:42:16] it he said it's over
[1:42:19] a fine Minister said a while ago said
[1:42:21] brother random if I could just have the
[1:42:22] joy of the Lord in my heart I said Son
[1:42:24] the Revival is over
[1:42:27] now we all want to identify with that
[1:42:28] Minister because it gives us an excuse
[1:42:30] to not have any Joy that's right yeah
[1:42:33] bless God
[1:42:38] I
[1:42:39] that's me okay
[1:42:41] never been who you preaching now I'm
[1:42:43] preaching My Flesh
[1:42:45] because you want to use every excuse you
[1:42:47] got right sure
[1:42:49] in the flesh
[1:42:50] well the Revival's over so if I want to
[1:42:52] be grumpy I can be grumpy
[1:42:58] the Revival is over
[1:43:00] he said Son the Revival is over but you
[1:43:02] don't know who that Minister was
[1:43:04] think about it somebody asking a
[1:43:06] question but we don't know his status
[1:43:08] we don't know if he'd moved on into the
[1:43:10] advancement or not
[1:43:11] just hang with me
[1:43:13] and and I do I will say this that it
[1:43:15] does affect us
[1:43:16] right we gotta fight
[1:43:19] and I think brother random is showing us
[1:43:21] too that that's the fight we're going to
[1:43:22] have to fight
[1:43:23] Satan's going to try to steal our joy
[1:43:25] but there's got to be somebody who's not
[1:43:27] identified with the mass of laodicea and
[1:43:30] the Blackness there's got to be somebody
[1:43:32] who's an overcomer of that
[1:43:35] said sign the Revival is over now the
[1:43:38] stabilizer has been put on the ship
[1:43:39] great fearful waves are out here before
[1:43:41] us but we know just beyond that wave
[1:43:43] Yonder nearing the shore he said we're
[1:43:44] nearing the shores and stay stable stay
[1:43:46] in the word stay with God and if you
[1:43:48] take that and you type that back to the
[1:43:50] Inner Room in the outer room and in the
[1:43:52] Old Testament there in the Tabernacle
[1:43:54] there was an interview there was a holy
[1:43:55] of holies there was an outer Court there
[1:43:57] was a there was a court of the Gentiles
[1:43:59] as it was and so in the outermost Court
[1:44:02] they were dependent on the outside uh
[1:44:04] the outside rain and all of that on the
[1:44:06] innermost Court they were dependent on
[1:44:07] on man-made things but on the inside of
[1:44:10] the inside was the Shekinah Glory when
[1:44:12] you got on the inside your joy is not
[1:44:14] dependent anymore on what's going on on
[1:44:17] the outside it's not dependent on a
[1:44:18] church Revival it's not dependent on a
[1:44:21] national Revival but it's dependent on
[1:44:23] that fire being on the inside of the
[1:44:24] holy of holies
[1:44:26] right brother random preached that for
[1:44:28] years
[1:44:29] and people still use it as an excuse for
[1:44:31] dead churches yeah
[1:44:33] now watch what brother random says
[1:44:36] now and
[1:44:37] now again now these we'll read this
[1:44:40] quote in a moment I want you to
[1:44:41] understand the Revival is over for
[1:44:42] America but not for the bride
[1:44:44] if you believe the Revival is over for
[1:44:46] the bride you failed to see her
[1:44:47] Awakening
[1:44:48] that's what they did they failed to see
[1:44:50] The Awakening of the Bride we know the
[1:44:52] next national Revival is for the Jews I
[1:44:54] mean I understand that today
[1:44:56] but if you say the Revival is over for
[1:44:58] you are you sad as an excuse to not be
[1:45:00] on fire for God what are you saying
[1:45:02] I don't want to be in church
[1:45:05] the love is gone from my heart
[1:45:07] The Joy has gone from my life
[1:45:10] because those are the conditions
[1:45:13] of the Revival being over
[1:45:15] I want to stay at home and watch
[1:45:17] television instead of go to church
[1:45:20] I'll say this there's no Revival in your
[1:45:22] flesh
[1:45:23] and if you give into it you'll do
[1:45:25] exactly that
[1:45:27] right
[1:45:28] but it's that inner man that's got to
[1:45:30] drive things that's the man in the
[1:45:32] engine room let him drive things if he's
[1:45:34] not in power today if he's not the one
[1:45:36] driving things it's time you come to an
[1:45:38] altar
[1:45:39] it's time you search for God and I don't
[1:45:40] mean you can come up here if you want to
[1:45:42] you need to find a place to pray yeah
[1:45:47] oh God
[1:45:49] say the Revival is over brother now
[1:45:51] watch I'm gonna read you something's
[1:45:52] going to shock you because the prophet
[1:45:53] said this too he said they say the
[1:45:55] Revival is over
[1:45:57] it isn't over
[1:45:59] it's the same Prophet yes after 1956.
[1:46:04] 1959 they say the Revival is over it
[1:46:06] isn't over go forward
[1:46:09] oh my
[1:46:10] if you want Revival go forward
[1:46:13] he said it's time that Pentecost has
[1:46:15] played out it isn't it's time for
[1:46:17] Pentecost to rise in the name of Jesus
[1:46:18] Christ and go forward
[1:46:20] there's no retreat there's no staying on
[1:46:23] the same ground let's move with the
[1:46:25] spirit or the spirit will move on to
[1:46:27] somebody else and leave you standing and
[1:46:29] that's exactly what it did to those
[1:46:30] Pentecostal people
[1:46:32] the Revival moved on into the wheat the
[1:46:35] maturing of the wheat you all understand
[1:46:36] that now we now we're laying in the
[1:46:38] presence of the sun to ripen but that is
[1:46:41] our Revival
[1:46:42] oh God
[1:46:44] look he said you see they were looking
[1:46:46] for the wrong kind of Revival he said
[1:46:47] you call for revivals you wait for your
[1:46:50] church to have a Revival well I wish
[1:46:52] brother Ben would be in Revival I wish
[1:46:53] the church was in Revival he said that
[1:46:55] it that ain't the Revival for you
[1:46:59] I believe we can have church revivals I
[1:47:02] believe we can see the spirit of God
[1:47:03] move but that ain't the Revival for you
[1:47:05] the Revival ought to begin right in you
[1:47:08] when you begin to thirst for God there
[1:47:10] might not be another member of the
[1:47:12] church wanting that Revival but if it
[1:47:13] breaks out on you it'll break out in
[1:47:15] other places see the problem is we're
[1:47:17] looking for Revival in a building we're
[1:47:19] looking for Revival in a preacher we're
[1:47:20] looking for Revival in some a tape or a
[1:47:22] book we're looking for Revival in a
[1:47:24] piano or an organ but that's not where
[1:47:26] the Revival is that ain't the Revival
[1:47:27] for you but the Revival is in here
[1:47:30] hey man he said today the church ought
[1:47:33] to be Jesus Christ in action upon the
[1:47:35] Earth again he talked about that Welsh
[1:47:37] police officer he tipped off his hat and
[1:47:40] he talked about the one you remember the
[1:47:41] story of the Welsh Revival brother
[1:47:42] Branham loved that Revival because it
[1:47:44] was started spontaneously by the spirit
[1:47:46] of God
[1:47:47] it just proceeded the Pentecostal
[1:47:49] Revival and the wells police officer was
[1:47:51] standing there and the men from overseas
[1:47:52] come to find Revival and they come
[1:47:54] looking for him and they said where is
[1:47:56] the Welsh Revival they were looking for
[1:47:58] a building they were looking for a group
[1:48:00] of people he said he tipped his hat and
[1:48:02] said serves the Welch Revival is held in
[1:48:04] here in his heart oh that's it he was
[1:48:07] the Welch Revival he said oh God if we
[1:48:09] can only understand that we are the
[1:48:10] reflection of Jesus Christ his word made
[1:48:13] manifest do we understand that this
[1:48:14] morning he said sir it's in my heart
[1:48:16] what building is it in sir it's in my
[1:48:18] heart he was the Welsh Revival he said
[1:48:21] today the church ought to be Jesus
[1:48:22] Christ in action upon the Earth because
[1:48:24] I live you live also my life will be in
[1:48:27] you the works that I do you do also the
[1:48:29] church has got to get to that place too
[1:48:31] and he promised it would do it and
[1:48:34] right the rest of you weren't watching
[1:48:36] and it will
[1:48:41] that's me
[1:48:43] I see that in the word and I'm going to
[1:48:45] identify with that you can identify with
[1:48:47] dead layer to see all you want to you
[1:48:49] can identify with with a religion of of
[1:48:51] the world all you want to you can
[1:48:53] identify make it all something some kind
[1:48:55] of emotion or something but I want a
[1:48:57] Revival of the word I'm not going to
[1:48:58] have it a prophet said I would the
[1:49:01] Revival's in here
[1:49:03] that's why a preacher can still preach
[1:49:05] with urgency people can still respond
[1:49:06] with urgency we can still have prayer
[1:49:08] lines we can still have altar calls we
[1:49:10] can still even though the Revival is
[1:49:11] over out here we can still feel the
[1:49:13] presence of God move Among Us get in our
[1:49:15] feet get in our hands get in our worship
[1:49:17] how does it do that because we are the
[1:49:20] Revival
[1:49:22] Glory
[1:49:24] amen
[1:49:26] he was so filled
[1:49:28] amen
[1:49:33] I'm almost done
[1:49:35] he said the church
[1:49:37] he said because I live you live also the
[1:49:39] church has got to get to that plant
[1:49:40] place too and he promised it would do it
[1:49:42] and it will it has it's got to come that
[1:49:45] way
[1:49:45] he said he was so filled with the Welsh
[1:49:47] Revival till he was the Welsh Revival
[1:49:49] we ought to be so filled with Christ
[1:49:51] till we reflect him in the power of His
[1:49:53] word that slaughtered to us to this day
[1:49:56] brethren
[1:49:57] can you hear the Cry of a prophet of God
[1:49:59] today don't take it as my words God sent
[1:50:02] a prophet in this hour
[1:50:04] maybe it don't mean anything to you but
[1:50:06] he's quoting the word what did the Bible
[1:50:08] say exhort one another
[1:50:10] more as you see the day approaching
[1:50:13] be together assembled together go to the
[1:50:15] house of God worship
[1:50:17] because Italians in the land she's
[1:50:19] trying to keep you from doing it she's
[1:50:21] trying to destroy the seed Royal
[1:50:23] oh
[1:50:25] no watch he said Brethren don't be
[1:50:27] stooped in things of the world these
[1:50:29] cares they're not all bad things but
[1:50:32] these cares that take you away
[1:50:35] stay with the gospel
[1:50:38] watch every word
[1:50:42] don't go back to what some father said
[1:50:44] let's go right now what Jesus said was
[1:50:47] to take place in this day what did he
[1:50:49] say we would be the Revival
[1:50:53] yes sir we are supposed to be the light
[1:50:55] of this age manifesting the gospel
[1:50:57] Luther was his life Wesley with his
[1:50:59] light Pentecost was his life but we're
[1:51:00] farther up the road now
[1:51:02] we're coming into the bride that called
[1:51:04] out the elected
[1:51:05] said remember if you are you're just
[1:51:09] like that officer
[1:51:10] musicians go ahead and come
[1:51:13] said he had it in him
[1:51:16] oh God you're the bride you're not
[1:51:19] in a desert with no water struggling and
[1:51:23] just burning up and barely able to
[1:51:25] breathe but you're by The Fountains of
[1:51:27] Living Water you've got an Artesian well
[1:51:30] out of your belly flows rivers of Living
[1:51:32] Water the Bible says you're the pride
[1:51:34] you're his children
[1:51:37] but brother man I don't feel that way or
[1:51:39] maybe it's gotten common to us
[1:51:43] brother random told a story let's play
[1:51:46] something doesn't matter what it is
[1:51:48] brother
[1:51:49] Brandon told a story
[1:51:54] about an old sailor
[1:51:56] the old salt he called him
[1:51:59] he was a writer
[1:52:01] never seen the ocean
[1:52:03] and he so badly wanted to see it and he
[1:52:06] wrote about it he wanted to see the the
[1:52:08] crashing waves and the Beautiful
[1:52:10] sunrises and sunsets when to smell the
[1:52:14] the salt Breeze
[1:52:16] if you've never seen the ocean what a
[1:52:18] beautiful what an awesome thing it says
[1:52:21] he was walking along so excited about
[1:52:23] going to see the ocean he said in an Old
[1:52:24] Salt coming back off the ocean out of
[1:52:26] the boat met him on the way and he told
[1:52:29] him he said so where are you going why
[1:52:31] are you so excited about he said I'm
[1:52:32] going down to see the ocean I want to
[1:52:34] see the waves I want to feel it I I want
[1:52:37] to know I want to be immersed in it
[1:52:39] you know you can watch a webcam of the
[1:52:41] ocean
[1:52:43] but it's not like being there
[1:52:47] there is a physical presence of God
[1:52:51] that surrounds us and I want to preach
[1:52:53] about that tonight the Lord willing but
[1:52:55] it surrounds us when we're in the house
[1:52:56] of God
[1:52:58] when we're gathered together we're two
[1:53:00] or three are gathered in my name I am in
[1:53:02] the midst of there is a presence of God
[1:53:04] that comes here and you can you immerse
[1:53:06] yourself in it by being there
[1:53:08] and this old salt coming back from the
[1:53:11] ocean
[1:53:12] if this man was describing it to him he
[1:53:14] said well
[1:53:16] I spent my whole life there don't mean
[1:53:17] nothing to me
[1:53:21] Lebron called him an old salt
[1:53:24] because as he aged the wind and the and
[1:53:27] the and the light the sunlight that was
[1:53:29] so pleasant to the man who's going to
[1:53:31] visit for the first time
[1:53:33] it actually hardened him it lathered his
[1:53:36] face toughened his skin
[1:53:38] he couldn't feel the wind on it like it
[1:53:40] used to didn't mean nothing
[1:53:42] but the Bible said that's why America
[1:53:44] lost her Revival it become common to her
[1:53:49] can you think of that she didn't lose it
[1:53:52] because it wasn't available
[1:53:53] [Music]
[1:53:56] she didn't become dead and cold and
[1:53:59] formal because there was no Revival
[1:54:01] available
[1:54:02] she become dead and cold and formal
[1:54:04] because it was too available
[1:54:06] [Music]
[1:54:08] it was surrounder and God shook those
[1:54:10] gifts all around her a prophet of God
[1:54:12] Ministries going everywhere Healing The
[1:54:15] Sick raising the dead Pentecostal moves
[1:54:17] everywhere and it becomes so common to
[1:54:19] the people
[1:54:21] they didn't even they come to church and
[1:54:24] I said make me happy
[1:54:25] Show Me A Sign
[1:54:28] God instead of falling on her face and
[1:54:30] believing
[1:54:32] and being like the Gentile
[1:54:34] the man who's come to Jesus said I'm not
[1:54:36] even worthy that you step in my house
[1:54:39] but I believe by you at your word
[1:54:42] my daughter will be healed
[1:54:45] but instead of being like that they they
[1:54:47] were so used to having him around the
[1:54:49] Pharisees were so used to having Jesus
[1:54:51] there that they forgot to even welcome
[1:54:53] him and wash his feet oh God I pray that
[1:54:55] we would not be so used to going to
[1:54:57] church we would not be so used to
[1:54:59] singing the Psalms that when we sing
[1:55:00] about a redeemer it don't mean nothing
[1:55:02] to us when we cry out about an Old
[1:55:04] Rugged Cross it don't mean nothing to us
[1:55:06] we talk about the agony of Gethsemane
[1:55:08] and it doesn't mean anything to us we
[1:55:09] talk about an open book and a message of
[1:55:11] the hour and it doesn't through our
[1:55:12] hearts anymore why we're becoming old
[1:55:15] salt
[1:55:16] so God help us today
[1:55:18] God help us today it's not because the
[1:55:20] presence of God isn't here he's here
[1:55:23] promised he would be
[1:55:25] but are we willing to accept it
[1:55:28] put aside things for just a moment
[1:55:31] say Lord I welcome you being I want to
[1:55:34] be in Revival Lord
[1:55:36] I want to hide my children in the house
[1:55:38] of God I want to have a home that's
[1:55:39] right I want to have a church home
[1:55:40] that's right the only way that I can do
[1:55:42] that
[1:55:43] is by being in your presence Lord
[1:55:46] you can be here physically in church and
[1:55:48] not be in the presence of God
[1:55:51] because you so hardened to it
