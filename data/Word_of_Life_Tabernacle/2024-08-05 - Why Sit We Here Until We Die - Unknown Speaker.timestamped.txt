[38:32] Jesus name
[38:35] amen
[38:37] amen hallelujah 2 Kings chapter 7 and
[38:41] verse three I've just got a few things
[38:43] on my heart and we'll get right into the
[38:45] communion service this
[38:48] afternoon Second Kings
[38:51] 7 and
[38:55] three it says there were
[38:58] four leprous men at the entering end of
[39:02] the
[39:04] gate they said one to
[39:06] another why sit we here until we die I
[39:11] want to title our thought tonight why
[39:13] sit we here until we die pray the Lord
[39:16] would that his Blessing to the word you
[39:18] may be
[39:21] seated someone has said the definition
[39:23] of insanity is doing the same thing over
[39:26] and over again and expecting different
[39:30] results Samaria was capital of the
[39:33] Kingdom of Israel at that time and they
[39:36] were had been besieged by the Syrian
[39:40] Army and the four men had leprosy so
[39:45] they were already had very difficult
[39:46] lives in fact best they could hope for
[39:50] is to hope for a few coins thrown in
[39:52] their general direction out of pity
[39:54] because they thought leprosy was
[39:56] contagious and
[39:57] so people wouldn't come near them in
[39:59] fact uh they had to holler out unclean
[40:02] unclean if they would go uh down the
[40:05] street and so the people they they just
[40:08] they wouldn't even get near them but
[40:09] they throw coins in their Direction but
[40:12] this was a time when there was no coins
[40:14] there was no money and if you even if
[40:17] you had money there was no food to buy
[40:20] because the siege had gone on for so
[40:22] long and the famine was so great it was
[40:25] scarce food was scarce for them even in
[40:27] good times but now it's
[40:30] non-existent and so these four men come
[40:34] back day after day and I want you think
[40:35] about it for a moment they come back
[40:37] every day and they come back and they
[40:39] sit by the gate and the gate's
[40:42] closed no one's coming in or going out
[40:45] no one has any bread no one has any
[40:48] ability to give in fact it's gotten so
[40:51] bad in the city that the Bible tells us
[40:54] that mothers were were cooking their
[40:59] children I know it's graphic but that's
[41:01] what the Bible says and eating those
[41:03] children they turned into cannibals
[41:06] because it' gotten so bad in the city
[41:09] and here were lepers like the lowest of
[41:11] the low in the city on the lowest rung
[41:14] the last ones to get fed would be the
[41:16] lepers and even the king didn't have
[41:18] anything to eat and the lepers were down
[41:20] here and there by them and and and they
[41:22] come back and I can just imagine I don't
[41:24] know how long they did it they may they
[41:25] may come back for a week week for a
[41:27] month for a year and however long that
[41:30] it was they just kept coming back and
[41:32] they're coming back to the gate and and
[41:34] they sit down and get ready to beg
[41:36] there's nothing to beg
[41:37] of there's no
[41:40] food and they just sat
[41:42] there it just sat there and it reminds
[41:45] me of people you know sometimes we get
[41:47] stuck in a rut we we've been doing
[41:49] something the same way and we've do it
[41:50] over and we do it over and we do it over
[41:52] and we do it over again and and finally
[41:55] one of them looks at the other maybe
[41:56] it's named name was Joe he said you know
[41:58] he said you know Joe he
[42:01] said why don't we do something
[42:05] different how about today we do
[42:08] something
[42:09] different the what we're doing is not
[42:12] working it's not getting us anywhere
[42:14] we're just we keep coming back and the
[42:16] famine still out there and and
[42:18] everybody's scared to move and scared to
[42:20] do anything they said we might as well
[42:22] do something different they said if we
[42:25] sit here we're going to die
[42:28] if we sit here what we're doing isn't
[42:30] working and again it it reminds me of
[42:33] you know maybe things have happened in
[42:35] your family and things in and in mine
[42:37] and I got thinking about things that
[42:39] even in in my own life and things that
[42:41] have happened and and and you look back
[42:43] at your father and your mother and your
[42:45] grandparents and you think well they did
[42:46] things a certain way but but I don't
[42:48] necessarily have to do it that way and
[42:51] maybe in our church we do things a
[42:53] certain way and we come a certain way
[42:55] but maybe we don't always have to do it
[42:56] that way we just want to come according
[42:58] to the word but if what you're doing
[43:00] right now isn't working maybe you ought
[43:02] to try doing something
[43:05] else right is that is that okay tonight
[43:08] and they lived in a time when death was
[43:09] everywhere and I want you to understand
[43:11] today that death is everywhere the death
[43:14] angel has come and he he smoted every
[43:17] every church every home with spiritual
[43:19] death and the only one he can't get to
[43:22] is those under the
[43:23] token but if we've not been living like
[43:26] we should if we've not been if we've not
[43:28] been uh uh if we not been stepping out
[43:30] into the promises of God and we keep
[43:32] falling back in the same traps why not
[43:35] take a chance and step out do something
[43:38] different for a change you've sat there
[43:39] for for 30 years and never raised your
[43:42] hand never raised your voice well maybe
[43:43] try something
[43:46] different maybe you for all these years
[43:49] you'd say well I I've never been a sh
[43:51] maybe try something
[43:53] different uh maybe maybe in your family
[43:55] you you always uh you always were uh uh
[43:58] you always treated your wife a certain
[44:00] way and she always treated you a certain
[44:02] way why not try something
[44:05] different just because you've always
[44:06] done it don't mean you always have to do
[44:08] it that way they said we're Beggars but
[44:11] we're going to die like
[44:12] this and I watch people you know you
[44:15] forgive me but as a pastor you watch
[44:17] people they uh they did things a certain
[44:20] way to get in a certain condition and
[44:22] they get in that condition and then they
[44:24] they they get out of it in some way or
[44:26] another and they get forgiveness or or
[44:29] healing or something like that but then
[44:31] they go back to doing things the same
[44:32] way well if it got you in that condition
[44:34] in the first place if not reading your
[44:37] Bible caus you to be backslid in the
[44:38] first place it'll do it
[44:40] again right why sit here until you die
[44:43] you might as well get up and believe the
[44:44] word of God you might as well follow God
[44:47] you might as well do what God says you
[44:48] know every time you get sick you I know
[44:52] sometimes we feel like well I just can't
[44:53] overcome this sickness why not try to
[44:55] step out in faith and believe what What
[44:57] God
[44:58] Says what you're doing is not
[45:01] working and I don't think that should be
[45:02] a discouragement to us it's but there's
[45:04] an
[45:05] opportunity to do something different
[45:08] and in 2 Kings 7:3 it says why sit we
[45:11] here till we die if we say we will enter
[45:14] into the city then the famine is in the
[45:15] city and we shall die there and if we
[45:18] sit still here we die also now therefore
[45:21] come this guy had a bright idea didn't
[45:23] he let us fall to the host of the
[45:25] syrians if they say alive we shall live
[45:28] if they kill us we shall but die it's
[45:31] like we're going to die
[45:33] anyway huh that's pretty morbid it's
[45:36] pretty
[45:38] dark but the point is we got to do
[45:41] something anything's better than sitting
[45:43] and rotting on a church
[45:45] pew I hope you hear me so well I I you
[45:49] know I never could get really the faith
[45:50] to go up and be prayed for anything's
[45:52] better than staying in that
[45:54] condition right why sit here until you
[45:56] die
[45:57] you sit here in in a bad situation I
[46:00] told people before the only worst the
[46:02] worst thing in a marriage is not fussing
[46:05] it's
[46:06] apathy right and I'd say in our
[46:08] relationship with Christ the worst thing
[46:09] is not fussing it's not that we're we
[46:12] we're we're uh in other words it's not
[46:14] that we're uh we're struggling or
[46:16] wrestling with things that's not the
[46:17] worst thing the worst thing is not
[46:20] caring right because then you're dying
[46:22] and you're sitting there and you might
[46:23] as well do something different you know
[46:26] and many times we resist the word in our
[46:28] lives might as well wholly follow the
[46:29] word of God might as well believe the
[46:31] message of the hour might as well step
[46:33] out in faith and follow and see maybe
[46:35] God will do something in our lives but
[46:38] brother brandom tells us that he said
[46:40] they had a little dingy faith I love the
[46:43] way he put that a little dingy Faith but
[46:45] it was enough to move them and I'll say
[46:48] tonight I want to challenge us how much
[46:49] Faith do we have tonight it may be just
[46:51] a little dingy Faith but is it enough to
[46:53] move us to do something different to
[46:56] apply a different kind of Faith than
[46:58] what we've had not something against the
[47:00] word but something that would follow the
[47:03] word now what what happened in this
[47:06] situation when they said this they
[47:08] didn't realize that that day a
[47:11] Vindicated Prophet named Elisha that was
[47:14] in the city that day he had said
[47:17] tomorrow you're going to be able to buy
[47:19] bread at a normal
[47:20] price right that he had already said
[47:23] that but they didn't know what a
[47:25] Vindicated Prophet said so they said we
[47:28] might as well just go if we die we die
[47:30] right but we're not under that they only
[47:33] went because anything is better than
[47:34] what they were doing but now many times
[47:38] brother Brandon would speak to someone
[47:39] on a wheelchair on a on a c and in in
[47:42] particular and they would be sitting
[47:44] there and he would tell this story to
[47:46] that person and he said it's like the
[47:48] leper sitting at the gate and said why
[47:50] sit we here till we die he said if they
[47:52] go in the city at Samaria they was
[47:54] already starving eating one another's
[47:55] children if they sit there they die died
[47:57] they had to go down to the enemy's camp
[47:59] and they took that
[48:01] chance he said you don't have to take
[48:03] that chance see it's not a chance for us
[48:06] you're not invited to an enemy's Camp
[48:09] you're invited to the throne of your
[48:11] father oh my oh aren't you glad you've
[48:14] not been invited to an enemy's Camp
[48:15] you're not saying well maybe they'll
[48:17] maybe he'll spare us maybe he'll let us
[48:18] live but you've been invited to the
[48:20] throne of your father you remember the
[48:23] prodigal son when he went out when he
[48:25] was coming back home he said maybe my
[48:26] father let me live like one of the hired
[48:28] servants oh that wasn't the kind of man
[48:30] his father was he said father let me
[48:33] live like one of your hired servants he
[48:34] said no bring the best robe bring kill
[48:36] the fatted C put the ring on his finger
[48:39] amen what was it you might as well
[48:42] accept a Father's love you might as well
[48:46] follow what he said to do now look he
[48:48] said the Throne of your father's
[48:50] expecting you to come tonight you're not
[48:51] lepers sitting at the gate waiting
[48:53] taking a chance on a miracle your son's
[48:56] and Daughters of the king so I'll say
[48:59] this when we get up from our seats
[49:01] tonight to take communion why sit here
[49:03] till we die maybe we've done that a
[49:05] hundred times but this time let's make a
[49:07] full commitment to God this time let's
[49:10] follow the word with all of our heart
[49:12] this time let's believe for our healing
[49:14] this time let's believe that our church
[49:15] is going to be in Revival this time
[49:17] let's believe for the Salvation of our
[49:19] children he said but I've come a h
[49:20] hundred times before this time take a
[49:23] step of
[49:25] Faith do something something different
[49:27] try
[49:29] believing try coming to church with a
[49:31] positive attitude what you're doing is
[49:34] not working you might as well do
[49:35] something
[49:36] different right are you with me now I'm
[49:38] not trying to be hard but sometimes we
[49:40] just need to be shook up a little bit
[49:42] just need to do something different why
[49:44] sit here till we die you're not taking a
[49:47] chance on a miracle what does the Bible
[49:48] say is any sick among you let him call
[49:51] for the Elders of the church let them
[49:53] pray over him anointing him with oil in
[49:54] the name of the Lord and the prayer of
[49:56] Faith what does it say shall save the
[50:00] sick and the Lord shall raise him up and
[50:03] if you have committed sins they shall be
[50:06] forgiven
[50:07] him it's a One-Stop
[50:10] shop he said call for the Elders of the
[50:12] church say well I just you know I just
[50:15] sit here and I got these issues in my
[50:16] life you might as well take a step of
[50:19] Faith what you doing is not
[50:22] working confess your faults one to
[50:24] another oh I think people ought to try
[50:26] that
[50:27] sometime pray one for another that you
[50:30] may be healed the effectual fervent
[50:33] prayer of a righteous man availeth much
[50:34] listen if if the more you stay out of
[50:37] church the more backslid you get try
[50:40] something
[50:42] different the farther you hang back from
[50:44] God the more you go out in the world the
[50:46] more you dabble in things you know
[50:48] better than to dabble in try something
[50:51] different come back to the communion
[50:54] table get up from where you're at and
[50:56] just just make a move he said does that
[50:58] matter it matters to God he sees your
[51:00] intent and your faith and your
[51:02] sincerity when you do he said confess
[51:05] your faults one to another and pray one
[51:06] for another that you may be healed the
[51:08] effectual fervent prayer of a righteous
[51:10] man availeth
[51:13] much see were not lepers waiting on a
[51:15] handout from a denominational leader or
[51:17] the wife of the king or his bride why
[51:21] sit we here the price has been paid is
[51:24] our home life in chaos start having
[51:26] family prayer again why sit we here till

[51:37] need don't sit and worry about it go to
[51:39] work and believe God will
[51:41] provide see Faith isn't sitting at home
[51:43] worrying faith is talk taking your
[51:45] resume to every business in
[51:48] town right it's not just sitting in home
[51:50] worrying about it well I may not be able
[51:52] to make the bills this month and and
[51:54] I've had people tell me that and say
[51:55] well God hasn't given G me a job I don't
[51:57] know what he's waiting on well he may be
[51:58] waiting on you to pick up your resume
[52:00] and take it
[52:02] somewhere right get up and see what God
[52:05] will
[52:06] do walk and that's just a natural thing
[52:09] but that's important to us isn't it we
[52:11] want to make sure our families are
[52:12] provided for why sit in church

[52:29] isn't working Let It
[52:33] Go are you backslid
[52:39] upslide say brother Ben I can't do that
[52:41] take the step of Faith you've ever seen
[52:43] these kids out here half of them more
[52:45] than half of them they all be going the
[52:46] wrong way up the slide you ever notice
[52:48] that in the playground it's want to
[52:49] prove they can do it why don't you begin
[52:51] to start being a son or daughter of God
[52:53] and say well you know and you say well I
[52:55] back said I don't know how to get back
[52:57] we'll start undoing the things you did
[52:58] to
[52:59] backslide or doing the things you failed
[53:02] to do when you backslid see he wants you
[53:05] you're not you're not going to an
[53:07] enemy's Camp you're coming to the throne
[53:08] of the king he's waiting on you with
[53:11] open
[53:14] arms huh if if you quit reading your
[53:17] Bible quit listening to tapes become
[53:18] unfaithful to the church and that cause
[53:20] trouble in your home do the
[53:22] opposite don't sit there and die you
[53:25] don't have to be what your parents were
[53:28] your grandparents were what somebody
[53:29] else was sit there and
[53:32] die listen brother brand says this he
[53:34] said he was ask a question brother
[53:36] brandom I'm saved and I've been baptized
[53:37] in the name of Jesus Christ but how do I
[53:39] get away from a stubborn spirit that I
[53:41] can't seem to break away from well my
[53:43] Christian brother or sister whoever it
[53:44] may be he said now most times when you
[53:46] find people who got stubborn Spirits
[53:47] it's usually a complex that causes you
[53:50] that have inherited from mother father
[53:51] Uncle an or grandmother grandfather
[53:54] somebody like that whoever you want to
[53:55] blame it on
[53:57] and if you'll Trace back down through
[53:58] your life you'll find he said I've taken
[53:59] this by experience under discernment
[54:01] because I've met cases on the platform
[54:03] thousands of those that had that Spirit
[54:05] the first thing you know i' chase that
[54:07] Spirit right back by discernment and
[54:08] find there was a granddaddy there was a
[54:10] grandmother was somebody else back down
[54:11] there and you inherit that by Nature
[54:13] stubborn stubbornness is not of God and
[54:16] only way to get away from that he say is
[54:18] you have to have faith to overcome that
[54:20] that you're a Christian it's not some
[54:22] magic Hocus Pocus or something that make
[54:25] you overcome that you got to have faith
[54:26] Faith you got to believe he said you're
[54:28] a son or daughter of God whichever you
[54:30] may be you'll never be able just to
[54:31] stand and rebuke it and rebuke it and
[54:33] rebuke it you said it's just like
[54:35] penalizing a rattlesnake he's laying
[54:37] there trying to ready to bite you if
[54:38] you'll just ignore him and listen walk
[54:40] away from him he can't hurt you if
[54:43] you've been striking at it and it keep
[54:45] striking back walk away from it well I
[54:48] can't kill this serpent well go where
[54:50] he's not
[54:52] then right keep having problems with
[54:55] your phone shut it off
[54:58] why sit we here till we
[55:00] die
[55:02] right everybody so why wish the church
[55:04] was on fire get on
[55:07] fire get in your prayer closet me to cry
[55:09] out to God and God will give you the
[55:11] fire why it's just something many times
[55:14] we're not we're waiting on God to do
[55:15] something he's already done all he's
[55:17] going to do he's just waiting on us to
[55:19] make a move the word of the Prophet had
[55:21] already been spoken he said tomorrow
[55:24] there'll be bread in the city oh they
[55:26] had to do was get up from where they
[55:27] were and move to a land of possibility
[55:30] all you have to do is get up from where
[55:31] you're
[55:33] at I pray this would happen tonight as
[55:35] we take communion I know it's an odd
[55:37] communion sermon
[55:39] but we we physically we have to get up
[55:41] and come take the communion made me
[55:43] think of this why sit there till we die
[55:46] might as well take
[55:48] communion might as well serve God say
[55:51] well I'm not able to take communion
[55:53] because I got this in my life well
[55:55] repent of it
[55:57] and if you're not a Christian become a
[55:59] Christian how do I do that acts
[56:02] 238 repent be
[56:04] baptized right you can do that you can
[56:07] do that you'll receive the gift of the
[56:08] Holy Ghost he said don't just strike at
[56:10] it ignore it and walk away from it so
[56:13] when you feel you got a stubborn Spirit
[56:14] lay the thing on the Altar and believe
[56:15] God that the thing is dead never you'll
[56:18] never have it no more and go on don't
[56:19] even pay any attention to it no more and
[56:20] the thing will leave you resist the
[56:22] devil and he'll flee from you that is
[56:24] get away quickly so that would be my
[56:26] advice how to overcome it he said we
[56:28] overcome the Devil by faith that's what
[56:30] we overcome all evil is by faith again
[56:33] brother brandom has asked a similar
[56:35] question when a person realizes he has
[56:36] an inferior complex or some sort of
[56:39] complex how may he overcome this he said
[56:41] so should it be if he was the only child
[56:43] caused this in his early youth so
[56:44] they're wondering what caused it brother
[56:47] BR just gives them a simple answer he
[56:48] said take exactly the
[56:50] opposite if you're always wanting your
[56:52] way and that one little brat that wants
[56:53] to always have everything your way turn
[56:55] right back to around give everything you
[56:57] got the other
[56:58] way so you realize the question they're
[57:01] asking why brother BR said that one
[57:02] little brat because they said do I have
[57:04] an inferiority some sort of complex
[57:06] because I was an only child you don't
[57:08] have to right don't speak that thing on
[57:11] yourself you don't have to you may be an
[57:13] only child and you could be uh the best
[57:15] most generous least spoiled only child
[57:17] in the
[57:18] world right if you just take the
[57:20] opposite you don't have to be that way
[57:24] if you're selfish you want to hold
[57:25] everything he said then start giving
[57:27] what you got do whatever just go vice
[57:30] versa that's the way to overcome
[57:31] anything is an antidote old southern
[57:33] mother used to say hair off the dog back
[57:34] is good for the
[57:36] bite right and just do it he said that
[57:38] applies this way too he said but brother
[57:40] Ben that's not spiritual enough it's
[57:41] very spiritual it was a it was the only
[57:44] thing that would save Israel is for four
[57:46] lepers to get up and do something
[57:50] different are we discouraged we need to
[57:52] encourage ourselves in the Lord like
[57:54] David listen I've read this quote to you
[57:56] many times but I just read it here and
[57:58] then we'll close in just a moment but he
[58:00] said if you notice it's when you're
[58:02] discouraged that's when the devil can
[58:03] really pour it on you that's when he
[58:05] gets you if you come to the church and
[58:06] say well I don't know I don't know
[58:07] whether I'll ever get any better or not
[58:09] I've been prayed for twice Oh my he said
[58:11] you might as well get go home that's all
[58:13] but when you can cast that aside God
[58:15] don't want you to be frowning how many
[58:17] believe that tonight God don't want you
[58:19] to be frowning God wants you to be happy
[58:22] the human heart was made to be happy
[58:23] worry will cause cancer temper will
[58:25] cause cancer don't never be upset just
[58:28] walk in his love knowing that you're
[58:30] walking in him and nothing can harm you
[58:32] there's nothing can harm you there's NE
[58:34] the powers things present things future
[58:36] nothing can separate us from him we're
[58:38] in him and we never come in by our own
[58:40] will but he by choice elected us and
[58:42] brought us into him amen so it's his
[58:45] business to take care of what he took
[58:47] himself other words he bought you it's
[58:50] his business to take care of what he
[58:52] purchased no man can pluck them from my
[58:54] father's hands cuz he's the greatest of
[58:55] all of them
[58:56] he said it's the father who takes care
[58:58] of it who's got any more power than God
[59:00] what kind of a power have you got over
[59:01] you to take care of you the whole power
[59:03] is the creator the universe took the
[59:05] solar system and said I can't even do it
[59:07] blew like that every Star went to its
[59:09] place sure he said he watches over you
[59:11] that's the kind of a father we have do
[59:13] you believe that tonight can we say Amen
[59:15] to that Lord I believe you're able I'm
[59:17] going to take this step of Faith why sit
[59:19] here until we
[59:21] die might as well be happy serve
[59:25] God so you can't live like that can't
[59:28] live miserable punishing yourself all
[59:30] the rest of your life you can't do that
[59:32] and you don't have
[59:34] to see brother brandom he talks to
[59:37] people that are sick he said sir you
[59:39] have cancer yellow jaundice you can't
[59:41] live laying
[59:42] there this is this is a powerful truth
[59:45] it's not very deep but it's powerful he
[59:48] would tell a person laying there he said
[59:49] you can't live laying
[59:51] there and the person is saying well if I
[59:53] get up I can't live I'll just die faster
[59:56] but what does getting up do it's not
[59:58] that they getting up miraculously healed
[1:00:00] them but getting up was an Act of
[1:00:02] Faith right because when they first got
[1:00:04] up they didn't feel like getting up they
[1:00:07] didn't get up from the wheelchairs
[1:00:09] because they felt like it they didn't
[1:00:10] get up because they suddenly felt strong
[1:00:13] they got up and then received strength
[1:00:15] that's true in the scriptures remember
[1:00:17] when they told the lame man such as I
[1:00:19] have I give and said when they grabbed
[1:00:21] him by the hand they held him up he say
[1:00:22] pretty his ankle bones receive strengths
[1:00:24] and pretty soon he's walking leaping and
[1:00:26] praising God but what was it he had to
[1:00:29] get strength but the act of getting up
[1:00:31] was an Act of
[1:00:33] Faith right he said he said he said if
[1:00:36] you lay there you'll die he said but you
[1:00:39] couldn't he said I tried I don't I can't
[1:00:41] heal you but you couldn't hide what's
[1:00:42] wrong with you see it's there you can't
[1:00:44] live sitting there you know that cuz
[1:00:46] you're gone they say it's in your
[1:00:48] stomach and it is it's in the liver
[1:00:49] which is causing the jaice to come up
[1:00:51] but do you believe with all your heart
[1:00:53] and ready now like those men who laid at
[1:00:54] the gate down there at Samaran say why
[1:00:56] sit we here till we die you're going to
[1:00:58] die laying there you've only got one
[1:01:01] chance and that is to accept him while
[1:01:02] you're in his presence believe it with
[1:01:04] all your heart he said will you do that
[1:01:06] and in the name of Jesus Christ believe
[1:01:08] it with all your heart rise up take your
[1:01:09] cot and go home thanking and praising
[1:01:11] God oh I think we need more faith like
[1:01:13] that he said do you believe that oh God
[1:01:16] will give him strength he said don't
[1:01:17] worry about that he said there is he
[1:01:19] must have gotten up and been weak he
[1:01:21] said there he is going to take his cop
[1:01:22] fold her up and go home Hallelujah he
[1:01:25] said the rest of you believe stand up on
[1:01:27] your feet now what about you getting up
[1:01:28] he said I don't care what's wrong with
[1:01:30] you raise up oh can we do that and I'm
[1:01:32] not talking about just literally or just
[1:01:34] physically but in our Spirits in our
[1:01:36] homes whatever is wrong with us stand up
[1:01:38] do something different begin to worship
[1:01:40] God again begin to have family prayer
[1:01:42] again begin to cry out to God again why
[1:01:46] sit there until you
[1:01:47] die Oh my he said raise your hands and
[1:01:50] give him praise amen again there was a
[1:01:53] man in a wheelchair he said you're
[1:01:54] shadowed for death it's cancer in the
[1:01:56] lung would you believe that God will
[1:01:57] make you well you do and if I was in
[1:01:59] your place you know what I'd do he said
[1:02:01] there was some lepers said at the gate
[1:02:02] one time and they said why sit we here
[1:02:03] till we die let's get up and do
[1:02:05] something about it if we sit here we'll
[1:02:09] die and and he said if we go in the city
[1:02:11] they're dying in there so we haven't got
[1:02:13] no choice if we go down to the camp they
[1:02:15] might spare us you're going to die in
[1:02:18] that condition sitting in that
[1:02:19] wheelchair Jesus Christ is your only
[1:02:21] hope now that's right he said so why
[1:02:23] don't you rise up from there take your
[1:02:25] chair and go home and be well in the
[1:02:28] name of Jesus Christ he said Do you
[1:02:29] believe every one of you then stand to
[1:02:31] your feet I don't care what's wrong with
[1:02:33] you now listen what he said stand up on
[1:02:35] your feet and believe God all that wants
[1:02:38] to receive Christ at this time raise up
[1:02:39] on your feet anywhere you want to he
[1:02:41] said raise up your hands now in praise
[1:02:43] to God raise up your hands believe him
[1:02:45] here comes the man up out of the
[1:02:46] wheelchair he said let's say praise the
[1:02:48] Lord he said everybody stand up this is
[1:02:52] powerful he said regardless of your pain
[1:02:58] the Pain's real but you got to stand
[1:03:02] up it's not that the Pain's not there
[1:03:04] it's not that you won't have to face it
[1:03:05] anymore the Pain's real but stand up or
[1:03:08] you're going to die doing things the way
[1:03:10] you've always done
[1:03:13] it stand up that C's not look not
[1:03:17] working for you the wheelchair is not
[1:03:19] working for you stand
[1:03:22] up
[1:03:24] look now look you look at brother
[1:03:26] brandom and think what kind of a man
[1:03:27] would make hurting people stand up CU
[1:03:30] maybe they had achieve some level of
[1:03:31] comfort in the cot some level of comfort
[1:03:34] in the wheelchair I this is odd tonight
[1:03:37] but it's just what was on my heart it
[1:03:39] achieved some level of comfort with that
[1:03:41] and they're just sitting back there by
[1:03:42] the west and saying well you know this
[1:03:43] is pretty good you know I'm listening to
[1:03:45] the word someday God's going to come
[1:03:46] heal me and a prophet of God said I
[1:03:49] don't care how much pain you're in I
[1:03:51] want you to stand up
[1:03:57] those that stood were
[1:04:00] healed
[1:04:03] Church see what we want somebody to
[1:04:06] sympathize with us but it's not what we
[1:04:07] need many times and there's time for
[1:04:10] that there's a there's a time and
[1:04:11] appropriate place for that but many
[1:04:13] times what we need is somebody tell us
[1:04:14] stand
[1:04:17] up why because unless they responded in
[1:04:19] faith to the word they would die sitting
[1:04:22] where they were he said oh Lord God we
[1:04:24] look at the Unseen We Believe now that
[1:04:26] you're Jesus Christ the son of God we
[1:04:28] condemn every Spirit of devil and doubt
[1:04:30] may they walk by the Unseen tonight
[1:04:32] Grant it Lord through Jesus Christ the
[1:04:33] son of God we ask it he said praise him
[1:04:35] with all your heart get up out of your
[1:04:36] chairs everywhere be well and healed in
[1:04:39] the name of Jesus Christ God bless you
[1:04:41] brother step out of there and go on
[1:04:44] home where does brother Bram get that
[1:04:46] from he didn't just create that but
[1:04:48] Jesus one time was at the pool of
[1:04:50] Bethesda you remember the story and he
[1:04:53] goes down to the pool of Bethesda and he
[1:04:55] bypasses those people there's a man
[1:04:57] there with maybe a prostate trouble or
[1:04:58] something that was wrong with him he
[1:05:01] could walk but he couldn't get down to
[1:05:02] the pool quickly enough before he got
[1:05:05] down there somebody else got in and you
[1:05:07] remember it was a real strange thing the
[1:05:08] angel but the pr said God always had
[1:05:10] some way of healing and so the angel
[1:05:12] would come down and trouble The Waters
[1:05:14] at a certain season and when he come
[1:05:16] down to trouble the waters they had to
[1:05:18] rush in because only the first one that
[1:05:19] got in got healed everybody else can you
[1:05:23] imagine how disappointing that was he
[1:05:25] sat there for
[1:05:27] years
[1:05:29] decades with enough Faith to believe
[1:05:33] that if he could make it he could be
[1:05:34] healed but he couldn't make it Jesus
[1:05:38] comes by because it it was a
[1:05:40] predestinated moment he was a
[1:05:42] predestinated seat of God and Jesus
[1:05:44] makes his way down through the mothers
[1:05:46] with little children with cancer and all
[1:05:47] these other things makes his way down
[1:05:50] through all of that brother BR said we
[1:05:51] don't understand compassion compassion
[1:05:53] is doing the will of God Jesus makes his
[1:05:56] way through all that crowd 5,000 people
[1:05:59] historians say sitting around that
[1:06:01] pool and and if you can imagine the
[1:06:04] scene Jesus makes his way unobserved
[1:06:07] didn't they didn't even notice he was in
[1:06:08] the church but he was there he makes his
[1:06:12] way down there and when he gets down to
[1:06:13] the to the place where the miles where
[1:06:15] the man was sitting there he looks at me
[1:06:16] he said do you want to be
[1:06:19] well the King James puts it this way wil
[1:06:22] thou be made
[1:06:24] whole wil thou be made whole it's a
[1:06:26] strange question isn't it well I've been
[1:06:28] here for 38 years you know and been
[1:06:30] trying to get down here and I can't make
[1:06:32] it he said before I get in he told him
[1:06:35] wilt thou be made whole he said if
[1:06:37] you'll be made well get up and
[1:06:41] walk pick up your bed amen hallelujah if
[1:06:45] you'll be made whole pick up your bed do
[1:06:48] you want to be well if so rise up and
[1:06:51] walk he picked up his bed and walked
[1:06:54] home sir
[1:06:56] what was it that's where brother bandam
[1:06:58] gets that from if you want to be well
[1:07:00] sometimes you got to you got to say you
[1:07:02] do if you want to be well sometimes you
[1:07:04] got to get up and come if you want to be
[1:07:07] well do you realize that if you believed
[1:07:08] it and I I you say brother Ben can you
[1:07:10] explain it I I can't explain it has
[1:07:12] something to do with our faith and and
[1:07:14] obedience to the word of God when we
[1:07:16] come to the communion table do you
[1:07:17] realize there's healing in that there's
[1:07:20] healing in just the act of coming if you
[1:07:23] would believe that you could get up from
[1:07:24] where you're at whatever situation
[1:07:26] you're in and come to the communion
[1:07:28] table tonight and say tonight I'm going
[1:07:30] to be well tonight I'm going to have
[1:07:31] strength in my body tonight I'm going to
[1:07:33] be I'm going to be better than I was
[1:07:35] tonight that old besetting sin is
[1:07:37] falling off of me tonight's going to be
[1:07:39] different I'm going to get up from where
[1:07:41] I am why sit here till we die let's get
[1:07:43] up and do something about it he said
[1:07:45] well communion is nothing don't you
[1:07:47] think
[1:07:48] that there's no power in the literal
[1:07:50] bread or the wine but there is power in
[1:07:52] obedience to the word of
[1:07:54] God do you believe it
[1:07:56] tonight amen as the brothers would come
[1:07:58] and I need a piano and organ player

[1:08:08] moment let's leave the past in the
[1:08:11] past say Lord I want to be
[1:08:15] well I I want to be a real
[1:08:17] Christian I want to lay aside every
[1:08:20] besetting
[1:08:21] sin I believe he is Made A Way by his
[1:08:24] death on the cross for you you and for
[1:08:27] me to reach that place where there is
[1:08:30] therefore now no
[1:08:32] condemnation to them that are in Christ
[1:08:34] Jesus who walk not after the flesh but
[1:08:36] after the spirit as we pray as we're
[1:08:39] getting ready to to read the scripture

[1:09:06] don't have the strength to stand on my
[1:09:08] own but if I can just get up you you'll

[1:10:33] as often as you drink it in remembrance
[1:10:35] of me for as often as you eat this bread
[1:10:38] and drink this cup you do show the
[1:10:40] Lord's death till he come wherefore
[1:10:43] whosoever eat this bread and drink this
[1:10:45] cup of the Lord unworthily should be
[1:10:47] guilty of the body and blood of the Lord
[1:10:49] but let a man examine himself and so let
