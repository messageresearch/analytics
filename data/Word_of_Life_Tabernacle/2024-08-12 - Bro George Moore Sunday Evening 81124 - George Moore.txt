coveted time slot uh right after everybody's got their bellies full and I got to try to keep everybody awake so we uh if we got to we'll stop halfway through and do some calisthenics or something and try to get everybody moving let's turn in our Bibles to Ecclesiastes the third chapter certainly been a blessing to be here with you today and just have enjoyed it and uh good to good to get to see everybody again and Ecclesiastes the third chapter very familiar uh scripture to us Ecclesiastes the 3 chapter and uh we'll read first few verses here Ecclesiastes 3:1 to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven a time to be born a time to die a time to plant and a time to pluck up that which is planted time to kill a time to heal a time to break down a time to build up a time to weep A Time To Laugh A Time to mourn a time to dance a time to Cast Away stones and a time to gather Stones together a time to embrace a time to refrain from embracing a time to get a time to lose a time to keep a time to Cast Away a Time time to Ren a time to seow a time to keep silent a time to speak a time to love a time to hate a time of war and a time of Peace what profit hath he that worketh in that which wherein he labor Earth I have seen the travail which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised in it Heath made everything beautiful in his time also he ha set the world in their hearts so that no man man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end I know that there is no good in them but for a man to rejoice and to do good in his life and also that every man should eat and drink and enjoy the good of all his labor it is the gift of God I know that whatsoever God doeth it shall be forever nothing can be put to it nor anything taken from it and God doeth it that men should fear before him that which hath been is now and that which is to be hath already been and God requireth that which is passed moreover I saw Under the Sun the place of judgment that wickedness was there in the place of righteousness that iniquity was there and I said in my heart God shall judge the righteous and the wicked for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work yes let's just bow our heads Lord Jesus we thank you for the reading of your word tonight Lord your word is life Lord we know that heavens and earth will pass away but your word will not fail father we thank you for the assembling together of the people today Lord the Bride of Jesus Christ the purchase of your blood Lord we're so grateful for the mighty works that's been done in our lives and now Lord we just ask that as we have this time together the further part of this service oh Lord we thank you for the songs that were sung we thank you for the specials the musicians Lord the worship and now Lord as we enter into this part of the service Lord we ask that you would open to us the word of God lord break to us the bread of life Lord I pray that you'd watch over me and bind my lips before I'd speak anything unpleasing to you and we'll commit it into your hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and a church said amen amen God bless you may be seated title of the message tonight is your season is coming and Saints we read here in the scripture that there is a time appointed for all things uh there are times in our life that if we'll just be honest have been better than others there's times where things are going better than they are at other times now I've been serving the lord for 27 years now and I've been happy ever since the day that he saved me I've been glad to be a Christian every day that the Lord has given me but there's been some days that's been longer than others and there's been some heartache along the way and there's been some trials and some tests there's some ups and downs in this Christian Life Saints there's times in our life when our families are doing better than they are at other times there's times in our life where we like our job better than we do at other times there's times in our life when our marriage is stronger than it is at other times there's times in our life when our relationships with our children are better than they are at other times we got ups and downs in our life we got ups and downs in our family there's ups and downs Even in our church there's ups and downs there's there's there's good times and there's bad times there's heartaches in a church there's blessings in a church there's tough days long nights there's times of Joy but there's times Of Heartache also and all of these things there is a time there appointed for every purpose and for every work under Heaven all of it the good and the bad so if you don't like how things are right now you can just wait a minute cuz things is going to change amen and if everything's going good right now watch out cuz things can change and we find that there's a time and a season for everything and brother Bram says that God's got a time for all things he's got a time as he was to plant corn we got a time we plow corn then there's a time we harvest corn he said the spring rains come the drought through the summer and the rain falls and the Snows he says and you just can't say I plant my wheat today and tomorrow I'll go out and harvest it see there's a lot of things Saints there's a certain time when we plant and there's a certain time when we Harvest and if you try to harvest at the wrong time your crop ain't ready yet and if you try to plant at the wrong time the seed will rot everything is app point at a time and the Lord's timing is perfect but we don't like to wait on nothing amen and and if you try to harvest when you are to be planting you don't have a crop amen and it's the case in God's word listen to this believer position in Christ he says God has set times for season he set seasons for his word and he has times in the scripture here where he says the presence of the Lord was there to heal the sick and he said that's when Jesus was ministering also and he says that the presence of the Lord was there to heal the sick maybe at other times the presence of the Lord wasn't there to heal the sick and we find out that God works everything seasonally now Saints sometimes the presence of God is here to heal the sick sometimes it's not but God is always a Healer now is that right Saints and we understand that God's word is always true but there's times when the presence of the Lord is there it's like in the pool of the Bethesda when they when the when the waters was troubled if you got in when the waters was troubl you got healed amen now we don't have that no more but I I'll bring to you remembrance those two sisters that brother Brandon prayed for in the prayer line they they were Sisters in Christ and one of them had a stomach issue and the other one had a tumor on her neck and if you remember they prayed for him and you remember the one sister she left out of that meeting and she went back and was testifying testifying how God had healed her testifying how the Lord had touched her but she couldn't hold nothing down and she was sick to her stomach and everything was coming back up on her and her husband even told her you're bringing you're bringing a reproach out here testifying how God healed you when it's obvious that he hasn't healed you yes now is that right Saints and he he she was testifying how God had healed her and then he said one morning she got up and the kids had had some toast and had some oats that morning and he said they look so good to her but she said she knew if she eat it it it it' come back up on her it was driving her crazy but she said she tried some anyways and she said boy I'm going to pay for that she eat some of that leftover toast and then a little bit later she eat that leftover oatmeal and a little bit later she was hungry again and she fried up a couple eggs made her a big cup of coffee got her some toast and bacon and brother Brown say she had a gastronomical jubilee oh I like a gastronomical jubilee and she was so excited after two months two months after the prophet prayed for her she' waited two months and got sicker and sicker and she was so excited about it she ran down the street to talk to the other sister and when she got there she thought somebody died cuz she heard screaming and shouting out there right and when she went in they was fluffing back the sheets and the sister said I went to bed last night looking at that tumor and I got up this morning and it's [Applause] gone times and Seasons Saints times and seasons and brother BR said what happened he said the very angel of God that made that promise he said I had nothing to do with it I didn't know him he says but thus sayith the Lord he said it taken him almost two months but he was passing through that neighborhood confirming that word that he spoke see God will confirm his word in his time and in his season right good now brother Brown gives the example of Moses and he said he knew that he was was called to be the deliverer and he was trying to do it his way and it was the right thing to deliver the children of Israel but he was trying to do it in the wrong time in the wrong way now he had the word of the Lord and he knew that he was to deliver the children of Israel but brother Brown said he tried to just jump right in that's right and sometimes that's what we do we see a little something in the word and rather than praying about it and and seeking God's will on we just try to jump right in and do something ourselves see he made the assumption that a lot of us make he assumed that if it was in God's word it was God's will for him but he failed to realize it must be God's time also now believer's position in Christ again brother Brown says as Full Gospel people I think we made many mistakes by looking into the word and say God said this and we fail to find the direct revelation of our life to fit in that program sir you see there's things that's in the word Saints but it may or may not apply to our life and time right now now now God has offices in the church is that right but that don't mean that everybody's called to preach God's got God and that's an office that God put in the church God put Apostles in the church but that don't mean everybody's called to be a missionary amen God put God put speaking in tongues in the church but Paul said do we all speak in tongues there's things in the word that that that are the truth and there thus sayith the Lord but it doesn't necessarily mean it always applies to every situation with each one of us okay now it's such a striking statement to me that the Full Gospel people make the mistake of looking at in the word and saying God said this but they don't have the revelation of how that fits in their life and and so if we read something in God's word Saints it's got to fit the pattern if you read something brother brandham said it's got to fit the pattern with everything else that he said if you read something that the prophet said it's got to fit the patter with what this Bible says see if you take a quote and you try to make it say something that this Bible don't say you got it [Applause] wrong now you can take one thing brother brandom said it and make it say anything but it's got to fit everything that he said and it's got to fit we don't believe in his Bible no more seem like people come up with all kinds of doctrines if they could just read their Bible where's it at in the Bible you ain't going to find the message leaving the Bible behind if you're trying to make the message say something that the Bible didn't say you're making it wrong yes good now if we hear something on tape it's got to fit everything else that's on tape it's got to be the time that he said it would happen see we put things out of place brother Joel right we put things on this side of the Resurrection it should be on that side of the Resurrection or or we put things in in the wrong context and we just confuse the people or we get we get the wrong type and we use a we use a good type but we use it in a wrong way this morning I was talking to you about the I forfeit my rights thing that sounds real cute but that ain't what he said amen we'll take a tape or something he said over here and try to put it together with something else he said over there and maybe we ain't got it put together right and we make him say something that he didn't say now he talks and recogniz I think it's recognizing your day in his message brother Bram talks about they're he said they're taking these tapes and they're they're splicing them they're cutting and splicing them well now we ain't got a problem cutting and splicing tapes today we got a problem copying and pasting today and you can copy something from over here and paste it in over there and copy it over here and pasted in over there and you got all kinds of doctrines amen but we got to read what he said before and read what he said after and and know what context he's saying it in and know why he's saying what he's saying and you got to listen to the tape before and you got to listen to the one after see if you just listen to stature of perfect man you get one understanding but if you listen to stature of perfect man and then listen to Blasphemous names you'll get a completely different understanding and the two go together yes so we can't just take one little snippet and run off and build a Doctrine on it can we amen so I'm so glad God sent us a prophet today to reveal to us these things he said it's got to be in God's time it's got to be in God's season it's got to be according to his word it's got to be the person he chose and that person's got to be Vindicated and many times we find that we got to wait all right and we don't like in this fast food super duper Society to wait right we want it right now now there's a reason for that Saints and that's that we have to learn that we're helplessly dependent on the grace of almighty God today I I can't say enough about the grace of God Amen I know maybe it's it's it's not in fashion anymore we we W talk about how good we are but Saints I need the grace of God I try to live as close to the Lord as I can I try to live as good a life as I can I try to be the best man that I can but I still need the grace of God I got to have it Saints I still make mistakes I I still say things that's wrong and I do things that's wrong and I I need the grace of God today sir and I think about brother co uh brother brand talking about Papa Cox and you you know the story many of you he talked about Papa Cox he said he was a good old man I loved him he said and I asked him Papa why don't you become a Christian and he says well brother brandom he said I would become a Christian when I can get good enough and he said I tell you what do Papa you look around and find out where you can get good enough and then tell me where that place is and I want to go to he said Christ never came to save good men he came to save bad men he says and when you think you're good he didn't come for you he come for save them that knows they're bad amen he said Christ died for Sinners and that's me Saints he said when you think you're good he didn't come to die for you right now Papa Cox told him said well what brother B I smoke these old cigarettes and he says I ain't even going to talk about the cigarettes he said I ain't even going to talk about them see Saints you don't get good enough and then come to church you come to church to get good enough oh God glory to God and he said I smoke these old cigarettes he said we ain't even going to talk about the cigarettes amen and then he goes into this store he said said they asked me is there any difference between Adam and Eve and the people today and he said are they the same physically as we are are they different he said no they're not the same they said well what difference would there be and he says well for one they wouldn't have a naval because they never they were created he said they never was attached to nothing and he said so if you can look and find a naval he said if you got a AAL he said you're Renegade to begin with so if you can look down tonight and find a belly button you're Renegade to begin with whether it's the any or an Audi Joel it don't matter if you got one you're a renegade to begin with all right yes sir now that's what a prophet said if you were born in this world world and he says it shows your Renegade to begin with and he said we're everyone in the same prison house everyone of us is in the same prison house every one of us that was born by sex is in the same prison house we can't help one another and he's talking to Papa about these things and he says you believe that Papa he said I believe it he said Christ died for bad men like you amen and he said will you accept it he said I'll accept it and he says I baptized him in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and he said he got up out of that baptism and went out and smoked a cigarette now he wouldn't make it out of a message Church alive today but that's what the prophet said he did then in God timing in God's time he said he found brother brother Papa Cox he smashed his back up real bad and he said he was laying in the bed right after that he was laying in the bed and said they went to carry him his cigarettes and he said the desire had done left him and brother and brother Bram said he had these old black hands where he was smoking those cigarettes and he said now he can't even stand to smell of them and he said but he put first things first don't try to get good he said you're bad to begin with and there's nothing you can do so as long as we're packing around that belly button today there's nothing we can do and many times we're going to have to wait on the Lord because there's a space of time between the sewing and the Harvest between the planting and the reaping there's a space of time in there and we got to learn to wait on the Lord good or bad we got to wait on the Lord and that's difficult but if we'll wait on the Lord the Bible said we'll get stronger in the waiting they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength is that what the Bible said now if you ever planted a garden now we can't do that in Arizona because we ain't got dirt but when I used to live over here i' plant a garden and you know you you can't plant a seed and go out and keep digging it up every day you got to plant it and leave it alone and you know no matter what you do you can go check on it every day check on it every day check on it every day you can't Harvest it until the fruit is ready there's a waiting Abraham had to wait 25 years now you can can get prepared you can plant and then get prepared he said Abraham and Sarah went and they got the bird eye they went and got the booties they got all the things ready started getting a getting the crib painted up they got ready but they still had to wait 25 years amen it's like if you pray for rain you better bring an umbrella it's like those little women did when brother Brandon prayed for them and they left out there testifying about how God had healed him so much so that they they said well you're bringing a reproach no they W they were preparing for the blessing that was coming they were preparing to harvest the blessing like the little man that got prayed for and and he said praise the Lord for healing me he was blind and he said praise the Lord for healing me for extra extra praise the Lord for healing me he was preparing for the blessing and he had to wait a little while but one day his eyes come open and he took off running down the street see that little woman she wasn't staggering she was strong giving praise to God her husband said she was a reproach but she knew her season was coming right now you say this you say well brother George I might I hadn't been that good during my waiting and sometimes when I'm waiting I'm pouting I'm whining I'm complaining I mean I'm not y'all I'm talking about me here I know y'all got Halos out there you say I hadn't done that good I hadn't done as good as Abraham did I hadn't done as good as those two little women did well I I would call your attention back to Moses now brother brandham said that Moses while he was out there on the back side of the desert after he' messed up and was C called away to the back side of the desert he said Moses lost all the hopes and all the power that he had that's what brother Bram said and he said he was thinking that freedom wasn't for the children of Israel so Moses was called to deliver the children of Israel but because of his failures and the tough times that he had brother Brown said he got out there and he lost all of his victory he got out there on the backs side of the desert even thinking that freedom wasn't for the children of Israel yes and he said God made him one day in a burning bush and when God sees him come along just exactly he revealed his plans to Moses and he says now the reason Moses had forgot about Freedom he says God's promises that he would free them but God hadn't forgot his promises we might forget God's promises but God hadn't forgot his promises and he said Moses tried himself and failed and he said that's what the church has done many times we tried in ourselves to do things and we fail to recognize God's element of time now you say I hadn't been as gracious as I should have been while I've been waiting I hadn't been as good as I should have been I've been Moody I've complained I I felt sorry for myself I been angry at the Lord sometimes that he hadn't delivered me Moses even lost his feeling for the people the people that he was sent to be the deliverer of Moses lost all hopes lost all the power that he had and he was thinking that the children of Israel wasn't meant for Freedom see sometimes when you're in the middle of a great battle or you're in the middle of a great trial you forget that everybody else is fighting the same devil too we for forget we lose our feeling for the other people we start concentrating on our problems and where we're fall short and the battles we're fighting and we forget that that brother next to us or that sister next to us is fighting that same devil we're fighting right we're all fighting tonight Saints make no mistake we're in a battle here and it might be a better time than others but every one of us is fighting a battle and we can get so involved in our battle that we lose sight of the other people everybody in here needs you we need you every one of us needs each other every one of us needs a a kind word a helping hand a little prayer now there's another trap we fall into and that's when we're fighting a battle and somebody else is being blessed amen now you guys just come through a meeting and there was a lot of people got blessed in that meeting but maybe you didn't feel like you got blessed the way other people did maybe you feel like well everybody else say was shouting and running up and down the aisles and I I just didn't feel it brother George I don't know what's wrong with me everybody else was anointed I I didn't feel it brother George what's wrong with me I'll tell you what the devil will do is show you how great everybody else has got it the devil will try if you compare yourself with others that's a recipe to be miserable cuz everybody else the devil show you how good everybody else has got it and how bad you got it everybody else makes more money everybody else has got a nicer family everybody else's husband is better looking now in Sister bry's case that's probably true everybody else has got a nicer bunch of kids everybody else's kids they always clean when they they come to church their hair is always combed everybody else got a better prayer life everybody else has got more faith everybody else knows more about the message everybody else's family's doing better everybody else's kids are doing better he they got their teeth brush too see that's what the devil does but he'll never show you the full picture he'll never show you the battle everybody else is fighting you'll never know the the war that somebody else is going through at J at their work you'll never know maybe they got a good paying job but maybe that job's killing them you'll never know the battle everybody else is facing their kids might look like they're doing good but you never know the battle those kids are fighting amen their family might look like everything's good but you don't know what's going on you never know what people are going through Saints people don't tell you everything they're going through you never know the battle but the devil will point out the good but rest sure everybody is fighting a battle tonight so we don't get jealous of what God's doing for others we don't get jealous when God's blessing others amen when they're being blessed we rejoice when they're hurting we mourn with them is that right is that what the Bible said so if you're in a season of trial and your brother or sister is in a season of blessing then you you can easily get a case of the why me Lords that's right why me am I not good enough am I not a Believer enough have I done something wrong no it might just be your season it might be their season it it it's a season appointed for everything if somebody else is healed and you're still battling with your sickness your season is coming Saints yes it's just a proof that that season's out there amen there's nothing wrong with you everything's going right it's just God's time now you find that he can drive you so far do you get jealous of the blessings and other people's lives now now this happened with brother brandham now brother brandom talked about how he went out to or Roberts and looked at this great Cathedral that he had built and he talked about how the uh the IBM machines was running and how how beautiful it was and how it was all imported marble and and all these thousands of things going on there like an assembly line and he said I stood outside and I got out to myself and I walked around to get in my car and something said to me he said it was Satan yeah he said but what about you Satan said to brother brandom what about you he said all Rober Ministry come off of yours so did Tommy osbor and here you are where's your IBM machines brother Bram said I'd have hated seen my office one little typewriter in the corner of a trailer one little phone he said what about you and he said he said Satan told him you see God don't trust you now this is a prophet of God that's right Satan coming to him God don't trust you oh come on somebody tonight and brother Brown said I guess that's right and he said just then he said I Heard a Voice and said but I am your portion Oh Glory to God Saints I Heard a Voice that said I am your portion Saints that's my desire tonight I don't I don't care who he's blessing and who he ain't just as long as he's with me just as long as I'm a Child of God today don't talk to me by no Crown just as long as he's with me at Saints if he's blessing me or if I'm going through the trial or if I'm going through a heach or if I'm on the Mountaintop just as long as he's with me Saints just as long as I know that he's with me he is my portion he is is your portion blessings will come and go but God will be with you always amen if he's blessing everybody but you you're still a child of God if he's healing everybody but you you're still a child of God tonight if everybody else's family is doing better than yours you're still a child of God tonight and the word is still true and your season is coming that's good yes sir I had a little sister I was up in Canada and she came to me and she was upset and and she was upset because she didn't she didn't have as emotional response as all the other young people and she was concerned that something was wrong with her amen see how the devil does it amen now this sister's life was wonderful Godly young lady just a blessing real help to the church but because she didn't cry as much as some of the rest she didn't feel like she's where she needed to be that's the devil Saints amen just as long as he is with us now brother Brown watch what happened here he said believer's position in Christ Christ he said God revealed himself he talking about Moses revealed himself in the burning bush and he found out that the very thing that was in The Burning Bush was the thing he lacked and I think that's a whole lot of with us today that many times we try to do the program ourselves and failed to get what was in the burning bush the direct revelation of the will and time of God what good would it do you to plant some corn out here today this preached in January he said what good would it do to plant some corn out here today it would rot it he said nothing would happen he said if it happened to sprout the cold weather would kill the germ it wouldn't work he said we got to have a season for it so then when Moses found out the real direct will of God and the time of God and the revelation of everything to do now try to keep him out of Egypt now he says right back to Egypt he went as hard as he could go for he knew that God had promised deliverance and the time of Deliverance had come amen so Moses knew what the word about said about it but then the Lord revealed to him it's time now and we can know the word Saints we can know what the word says about it but we've got to have that Revelation now is the time right good amen so this same man that had once been defeated that had once lost his feeling for the people now all of a sudden was set on on fire yes and he said you couldn't keep him out of Egypt then amen and you might be struggling today and you might be discouraged from the season that you're in but all you need is this Revelation all it's going to take is God to set fire to you all it's going to take Saints you say well I'm too far I'm so defeated I'm so far down I I I've been struggling with this for so long all it's going to take is for God to reveal to you here's my plan and now is the time and once he shows you the plan once he shows you the time all the devils in hell can't stop you from getting your healing they can't stop you from being delivered they can't stop you from claiming your family so when you're in the middle of something it can seem like the end of the world now I know none of y'all do but but like if you husbands and wives ever get into a spat oh it's all bad it's just all bad he don't love me she don't love me I just the marriage is a failure everything's bad everything's gone and then 30 minutes later you kissed and made up and everything's great all right in other churches not here see when you're in the middle of the battle everything's going oh just everything's wrong everything's wrong all it takes is God to set that fire or something amen you forget all about it then everything has times and Seasons so Saints I don't want you to get discouraged today tonight if your time hasn't come yet because your season is coming yes whatever that season is it's coming times and seasons and I think there's a burning bush experience waiting for all of us Moses had to wait 40 years on the backside Abraham had to wait 25 years brother brandham waited on the healing of his stomach his whole life and he seen thousands of other people worse off than him healed and he waited and and people crippled and lame and Halt and blind and withered were all healed and he suffered but there is a season appointed for everything under Heaven I'll tell you this God is faithful there's one appointed for you also there's one appointed for your need also there's one appointed so don't get discouraged if somebody got healed that don't mean your healing ain't coming if somebody got delivered that don't mean your deliverance ain't coming if somebody got blessed that don't mean your blessing ain't coming it's proof that it is coming your season is coming your time is coming Saints yes sir good but God's always faithful right and you might be struggling with your health maybe you've been waiting on the Lord to do something for you the word declares that he is your healer your time is coming maybe a family struggling you've been crying out for the Lord to come on the scene but God's word declares there's a token to apply and your season is coming Saints you might have been seeking the Holy Ghost and everybody around you has received it and you're still seeking and you might be getting a little discouraged but God's word said you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and your season is coming amen maybe you've been struggling with a stubborn spirit I nobody in this church I'm sure but others but God's word says he's a deliverer your season's coming that spirit's gone one of these days Saints and maybe you had a financial need you don't know how he's ever going to get you out of it but your season is coming because he's a provid Rider he's appointed a season but don't forget he's also appointed the season you're in right now that's right the season you're in right now the trial you're going through right now he's appointed that too the test you're facing right now he's appointed that too the the physical need you're got right now he's appointed that too the Bible said all things Romans 8:28 work together for the good of those that love the Lord and called according to his purpose Saints the good things the bad things the upside and the downside it all works together for our good it's not pleasant to go through it's not easy to go through but on the other side of it you see it worked out for your good that's right now we TR tend to gravitate toward the more enjoyable things amen when something's born or something's planted or something healed or something bu up or something time to laugh or time to dance or time to gather we we tend to gravitate toward that amen but remember we read that the other part of that just as important as there's a time to die a time to pluck a time to pluck up what's planted A Time to Kill time to break down a time to weep a time to mourn all things now I'll tell you what that first one sounds like a better evening than the last one but it's all according to the plan of God now 1 Peter 1:3 he says this we're closing he said blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ which according to His abundant Mercy hath begotten us again to a lively Hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead to an inheritance Incorruptible and undefiled that fadeth not away reserved in heaven for you who are kept by the power of God through faith un salvation ready to be revealed in the last time now I like this wherein ye greatly Rejoice though now for a season if need be ye are in heaviness through manifold Temptations there's a season of that but he says greatly Rejoice though you're in a season of manifold temptations that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold and Sil gold that perish though it be tried with fire might be found unto the praise and honor and Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ whom having not seen ye love in whom though now you see him not yet beli in you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of Glory receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls Saints said don't matter as long as he's with us amen we're here for a a season we're here for a time but but if it's good or it's bad some people's lives is better than others it don't matter right as long as he's with us in the end as long as we as long don't talk to me about no Crown just let me look at him let me make it let me get there where I can see him good as the musicians come to everything there is a season yes and some seasons are wonderful others are really bad some are tough some are a blessing but I would just say this all of them are temporary good or bad all of them are temporary so when things are going great praise God when things are when the blessings are falling receive them saints when the waters treble jump in have a good time when the time is there enjoy it while you can amen when the God's blessings are fall and enjoy it but don't get too comfortable cuz it's only a season and when everything's going wrong don't get too discouraged because it's only a season this two Shall Pass you're going to make it you're an overcomer your marriage might have ups and downs but it's only a season your health might have ups and downs but it's only a season your job might have ups and downs but it's only a season now it's hard when you're in the middle of the battle but don't get too discouraged I like this where it said he made everything beautiful in his time amen amen oh [Music] god let's just bow our heads tonight [Music] just with their heads bowed in their hearts to the Lord tonight if you say brother George I I'm in one of those Seasons right [Music] now and I'm struggling and I just need reminding that it's only a season it's only a Time and it really as long as he's with me it doesn't matter as long as he's with me that's all it matters as long as I belong to him I can make it I know I can make it I know that I can [Music] stand Lord Jesus you know all about it tonight father good times and bad times up times down times lord it's all according to your plan lord it's all according to your season and father we just committed into your hands Lord maybe we've not behaved the best during this downtime or drought or hard time maybe we've felt sorry for our s maybe we've gotten angry Lord Lord even your Prophet Moses he lost his feeling for the people he got discouraged oh God but all all he needed was a revelation all he needed was an experience all he needed was to get your direction for his life Lord God that's all we need tonight Lord we just need a touch from you Lord we just need your encouragement your direction we just need your Revelation for our life Lord we just want to know your will and Lord God as we battle oh God we know that there's blessings and there's trials but Lord while we're battling just as long as you're with us that's good enough father I just pray that you'd bless your people meet every need that's represented here oh God it's been a privilege to be numbered among them I pray Lord set fire to our hearts Lord create in us a desire in Jesus name amen amen Saints I just you know I I got just such a burden on my heart I I just if you feel like I do
