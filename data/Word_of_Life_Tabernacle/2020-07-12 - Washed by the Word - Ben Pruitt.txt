amen ephesians chapter 5 and verse 25. excuse me for being a baby i feel like the presence of the lord is here and and if you need something i i know that he's here to to give it to you tonight ephesians chapter 5 and verse 25 husbands love your wives even as christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish i pray the lord would add his blessing to the word you may be seated this evening there are a few things that feel as good as being clean and cleanliness cleanliness is more than a good feeling it's necessary that's kind of a recent discovery in history for years people didn't understand why you needed to be clean and you'd think that would be something that we would we would just get as human beings but i read a story a while back and i think i've used it before but it struck me today in 1818 there was a man by the name of ignaz simel vice he was a doctor and he was born into a world of dying women the finest hospitals in the land at that time lost one out of six mothers you think about that one out of six was the mortality rate for dying in childbirth one out of six mothers a doctor's daily routine usually began in the dissecting room where he performed autopsies that's how he started his day and from there he made his way to the hospital to examine expectant mothers without ever pausing to wash his hands i just didn't know and after a while dr dr simon vice began to see a correlation between the two i've been touching these dead bodies and performing autopsies and then i go and and he noticed that the midwives had a much better success rate than the doctors did and so he began to keep track of it and after a while he realized he didn't know why but he realized if he washed his hands that the mothers would live that seems like such a simple thing but if he just washed his hands they would live if he could just do that and so he washed with a chlorine solution and after 11 years of delivering babies he lost only 184 mothers out of 8 000 and some babies about 1 in 50. he spent most of the rest of his life lecturing and debating with his colleagues and he argued that this is a direct cause and that's the cause of the fever that they would get was he said i've shown how it can be prevented i've proved what i've said and he's speaking to the other doctors he said but while we talk gentlemen women are dying he says i'm not asking anything world shaking i'm asking you to wash wash your hands he says it this way for god's sake wash your hands no one believed him doctors and midwives have been delivering babies for thousands of years without washing and so they weren't going to listen to a little hungarian man and he wasn't going to change them now it actually drove him insane at the age of 47 some of ice died insane his wash basins discarded his colleagues laughing in his face the death rattle of a thousand women ringing in his ears see if they would just wash they could have saved them and the truth is that if we don't wash in the water of the word we may not die but others will if we don't handle the word with clean hands death comes so if you as we want to talk tonight about being washed by the word the first reason that we must be washed by the word is to prevent death and i read further in the life of dr simovision there was a man a friend of his a doctor who realized that he was right and he was felt so guilty over having went all through his career not washing his hands and even his own niece had died because he didn't wash his hands he realized he was right and he killed himself because he couldn't handle the the pain and of knowing that he he was the one who did it and all it would it would have taken was to be washed and be clean and he could have saved their lives pilate felt like that one time and he knew he was responsible for the death of an innocent man he knew he was going to be responsible so he had water brought he got in the water and he began to wash his hands he says i'm not responsible but he couldn't wash off the the stench and the guilt of having the blood of jesus on his hands he couldn't wash the guilt from his life brother branham put it this way in a sermon called what shall i do with jesus called christ he said like pilate stood with the same thing he said give me some water i'll wash it off my hands to prove when he returned back he still had to pass the judgment it didn't excuse him he tried to say well if i can't get him off my hands i'll put him on caesar's hands and it backfired right back to him it does to you too as an individual what are you going to do not what mother did what papa did what the pastor does what brother branham does it's on your hands he said what are you going to do about it with this jesus called christ because you've got blood on your hands and it's the blood of god he said now what are you going to do he said be guilty of the crucifixion you can crucify him accept your creed or whatever you want to say well well i'll just pass on off i won't have nothing to do with none of this church stuff you can't do that he's on your hands that's right he said he'll you say i'll just forget the whole thing you can't do it it's still in your hands well i'll just say my pastor taught me this it backfires right back to you if there was no blind sheep there would be no blind leading the blind it works both ways nobody to give credibility to the blind leaders if the sheep wouldn't blindly follow he said you can either receive him or reject him just either way you want to do it it backfires right back to you you see to be washed in the water of the word brother jt is to be freed from the guilt of the blood of christ i needed to be freed from the guilt of the blood of christ and to refuse to be washed just to crucify him afresh that's why if you know better and you know what it's the right thing to do and you go away anyway if you come right up to the borderline you walk the other direction you refuse to be washed by the water of the word of this hour you walk away from him the bible says you crucify him afresh put him to an open shame now in the old testament there were waters of separation in numbers chapter 19 and verse 9 it says that a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer that's the red heifer and i encourage you to go read that chapter if you get a chance when we're out of the service he said lay them up without the camp in a clean place and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of israel for water of separation it is a purification for sin now brother branham in a thinking man's filter goes into a pretty detailed explanation of this and i want to kind of take you through this and excuse me for reading but i believe it's important he said notice in exodus 19 he said i want you to read it when you go home and you have more time he said notice when israel had committed sin first they took a red heifer which had never had a yoke on her neck that means she was never yoked up with anything she had to be red the color red as an atonement color he said you know science knows that if you take red and look through red to red it's white look through red it red it's white he looks through the red blood of the lord jesus red sins will become as white as snow red through red he said and the heifer was killed in the evening time of the whole congregation of israel and there was put seven stripes of her blood upon the door where the whole congregation had to enter a type of the seven church ages by the blood and her body was taken and burned it was burnt with the hoof with the skin with the intestines with the dung everything was burnt together and it had to be picked up by a clean man that's the ashes of it it had to be picked up by a clean man it had to be put in a clean place outside the congregation he said therefore if israel could only see the type this word of god must not be handled by dirty hands of unbelief because if you handle it with dirty heads you kill the patient you understand he said well that applies to you preacher but no it applies to every one of us every one of us has to handle the word in our lives every one of us is responsible to the people that we meet and excuse me for being maybe you you think well brother ben if you just if you just preach something to make a shout but you know this ought to make a shout because i couldn't clean my own hands if i've got clean hands to handle the word with without it's not anything i did i had to go through the waters of separation i had to pass through by those seven stripes i had to i had to take the ashes and put them in the water and walk through and go in into the holy of holies and receive the spirit the life of that when the blood cell was broken the life left the bloodstone to come back on me and to be able to do that to be able to receive that there it had to be him that did it i couldn't do that for myself i couldn't clean it for myself but see i can't clean my own hands someone how much water no matter how much of a chlorine solution no matter how much germ x i might use i can't clean my hands of the blood of christ it has to be by his spirit i have to be washed by the word see and he said this word of god must not be handled by dirty hands of unbelief it's got to be a clean man and if he's clean he had to come through god's filter amen a clean man clean hands had to be kept in a clean place not a place where jezebels and ricky's and everything for taking take to communion and things when they're running around with wives and husbands and all kinds of filth going to dances and parties wearing bobbed hair and shorts and everything else call themselves christians just to be kept in a clean place handled with clean hands and then when israel sinned and recognized that they had done wrong then they were sprinkled with the ashes of this heifer upon them that was the water of separation of purification for sin he said notice here it is and when israel before they could come into fellowship in the worship they had the first pass through the waters of separation justification by faith cometh he said by hearing hearing the word amen he said then they entered into the congregation under those seven stripes the blood to show that something died and went before them for their sin they were separated by hearing the word the waters of separation and then entered into fellowship so it wasn't enough just to hear but it had to be take it took faith to believe the word and faith comes by hearing of the word of god you had to hear it in order to have the faith to come in to it right now they entered into fellowship now the only place that god met a man was behind that order he wouldn't meet him anywhere else he had to come behind that order god only met israel in one place and god only meets you today in one place and that's in jesus christ amen and he used the word the waters of separation and his blood was shed for all seven church ages and then by the holy spirit we enter into that fellowship which is only given to the church he said oh how great he is now this is something that if you would just go over that and ponder that and look back at the quotes that we've just read and let it speak to you you begin to realize what a great thing god has done for us in this day that we don't have to just come in and hear the word or go through the waters of separation where we can come all the way in to the holy of holies into fellowship with god which is only given to the church now you go back to the old testament and during that time they had to go through these waters of separation but there was no way to be really clean now think back what that must have been like you knew you were guilty but no way of being really clean without a sacrifice without christ's death on the cross we have no way of being clean we've got bloody hands you realize that unless you accept that what he did for you on that day you cannot clean your hands you can't get them clean enough no matter how many churches you go to no matter how many places you run to no matter how many good deeds that you do no matter how much you come and you pay your tithes to do the things that are right but if you don't ever accept what he did for you and line up to that word that he's given you in this hour you can't ever get your hands clean and you can go back and find a man as great as david and david longed to be clean but he could not under that testimony of the blood of bulls and goats he could only look forward to being clean he could only look forward to what we enjoy without him to be able to to stand here under that fountain and be able to be constantly consistently cleansed he couldn't do that david said wash me thoroughly he longed for it he's to wash me thoroughly from my iniquity in psalms 51 2 and cleanse me from my sin for i acknowledge my transgressions my sin is ever before me verse seven he said purge me with hyssop and i shall be clean wash me and i shall be whiter than snow he says i know you can do it god but he could not see the fulfillment of that until christ's death on the cross no matter how great of a man that he was had a heart after god's own heart but he couldn't once he had sinned he was you stuck it can only be covered put off to another time but now it can be done away with and in zechariah 13 1 it speaks of a time when the jewish nation you go back and read chapter 12 how that they will speak one to another and they'll say where did you get those wounds and he'll say in the house of my friends and it's the day of atonement and then in zechariah 13 1 says in that day there shall be a fountain open in the house or to the house of david in that day when in that day of atonement when they realize what they've done when that 144 000 elected jews begin to realize what they did in that day there will be a fountain open oh my you talk about the grace of god after they've rejected him for for thousands of years there will be a fountain open for to the inhabitants of jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness you say well what would that fountain be it'll be christ it'll be christ it'll have to be amen the same water that we're washed with today that provides cleansing to us will provide cleansing to them but i want to tell you that today there's a fountain open in the house of david in the spiritual house of david to the spiritual to the spiritual seed of abraham there's a fountain opened today to the inhabitants of spiritual jerusalem there's a fountain opened today to the bride for sin and for uncleanness we have to be washed you see we need to be washed to prevent death we need to be washed also to abide in the vine and to bear fruit when we are born again the waters of separation we pass through that and it cleanses the soul it never has to be washed again and yet there's trouble because we're caught in a body of flesh and a great man like apostle paul could cry out and say oh wretched man that i am who shall deliver me from these dead bodies right this decaying body the body of this death i'm like a doctor going up in the morning and touching all the dead bodies and then coming down trying to deliver a baby who should deliver me from the body of this dead how can i get clean because i touch the world every day every everywhere i walk there's there's problems and and everywhere i go i make mistakes and everywhere you say well preacher you don't sound like much of a christian no i am a christian but we still make mistakes and you do too if you don't think you do that's your mistake right but you know you're saved you were there you went through the waters of separation you walked through you you've been to that fountain you drank from those waters but now you find yourself unclean you feel unclean though your soul has been washed you feel unclean we find ourselves needing to be washed why is that it was after the last supper jesus and you will find it in john chapter 13. he says he loves his disciples and he loved them to the end i love that but it goes on down the aisle how he washed their feet and how they ought to do that and then in john 13 8 peter he comes to peter he goes and he washes all the feet of the disciples he comes to peter and peter says not me i said you'll never wash my feet see there's a certain pride in exaggerated humility you'll never wash my feet i can't take communion that you know i can't do that i never have done that i've been in the church 40 years never taken it not going to do it now it's pride you wanna know how you can take communion repent that's all i can do you wanna know how you can be how you can be worthy to watch the saints feet to take communion to live for god repent that's all it takes repent turn from your sin make things right but there's a pride in that you won't wash my feet and jesus said if i wash thee not thou hast no part with me and so simon peter being the man that he was it was all or nothing but hurry we talked about the other day simon peter didn't see any gray area black and white and so he says he says well he said if you if if you have to wash me he said not just my feet wash my hands and my head every part of me that don't have clothes on wash me and jesus said he that is washed don't need to need it's not safe to wash your feet i was putting arkansas language in there you don't need to wash the rest of his body but it's clean every wit he said you're clean but not all he said you're clean you're clean but let me wash your feet he said he knew who should betray him therefore said he you're not all clean so judas couldn't be cleaned by the word even though he had all the miracles and the signs that the rest of them did he wasn't clean he walked with them he was called to preach just like they were he was ordained by jesus himself to go out and perform miracles but he wasn't washed he wasn't cleaned oh my now so as they walk they would get their feet dirty your soul is clean to the word but your feet need to be washed my feet need to be washed and if we refuse i think spiritually now if you refuse to have your feet washed you have no part in christ jesus explains this further in john chapter 15 in verse 1 he says i am the true vine my father is the husbandman every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away every branch that beareth fruit he purgeth it that it may bring forth more fruit he cleans it he cleanses it he prunes it you would think that he would just purge the ones that weren't bearing fruit no he takes them away but every branch that bears fruit you say well i'm doing good time for a purging we've been through that haven't we well i'm doing pretty good i've got everything going good and everything seemed like it's smoothed out time for a purging time for a purging and and so what he says is i'm gonna take out whatever is not right so you can bear more fruit you bore fruit in your life he said but now i'm going to purge out that which is not right so you can bear more fruit so he says now you are clean through the word which i have spoken unto you it doesn't say you're clean because you shouted you're not clean because you spoke in tongues you're not clean because you cast out devils you're clean through the word you're clean to the word amen and and the word actually cleanses you not just once but every day now verse four he said abide in me and i in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except to abide in the vine no more can ye except you abide in me i am the vine you are the branches he that abideth in me and i in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me you can do nothing if a man abide not in me is cast forth as a branch and has withered men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned if you abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you herein is my father glorified that you bear much fruit so shall you be my disciples listen you want to be able to speak and things happen you have to go through the purging time you want to be able to to ask what you will and all of us do you got to go through a washing time you got to stand under the fountain and let your life be washed all of your life you will be pruned and purged he doesn't leave you and come back later but he abides with you and you abide in him you abide in the vine he purges and you don't understand we don't understand why sometimes someone will be left in a nursing home for years i don't understand that but joe i don't understand why a man be a christian all this life or a woman to be a christian all her life and she gets down to the end and her she's so decrepit and and not able to hardly move and unable to take care of herself almost a vegetable why does god allow them to live you want to explain a mystery explain that one we don't know but there's something god is doing he's purging he's doing something forgive me for being personal but when my dad had cancer and i watched him there dying he's been a healthy man all of a sudden he gets cancer a year later he's gone at the age i believe in 57 and he's there in the hospital and i watched him and at that point and you all know what this is a person can suffer so much that you're relieved when they pass and that's the way it was my first feeling and i almost felt guilty about it because i felt that i was relieved by the fact that he passed away because he just wasn't suffering anymore but i didn't understand the suffering part and understand that if you're going to die and you're not going to be raised up then why not just why not just go but see what what happens is god as long as there's life there at all he's able to work even if it's on a subconscious level even if they can't talk or speak or somehow he's working somehow he's purging he's still using that if for nothing else than to remind us this is not our home and if there were no pain here we would never be ready for another side but because we've gone through 2020 because we've gone through the things that we've had we've had to fight through the pain and our bodies maybe are not what they used to be you begin to realize there's a better place there's a place where there is no pain there's a place where i won't have to slow down until i stop there's a place beyond this place amen i read today forgive me for digressing from my notes but it's wednesday night so i read today that the people who were most scared they did a survey if if you thought you were likely to die from covet 19 and the people most scared are people my age the people my age think they're likely to die at a rate that people over 65 are actually likely to die at and the people over 65 have a pretty good idea about what rate the rate that they picked was just about right but the people my age put it actually worse than theirs you think why why would that be you know there's something that's going on where we don't realize we haven't been through enough to realize how hard life is and so we think this happens we're going to die and i don't mean to belittle anyone because i know there have been people my age died of that and i come through it and god blessed me and i i don't want to belittle that at all but but you realize that people my age just haven't been through enough once you've been through enough you say you don't understand i could die any day paul says that you know you take that scripture it works two ways he says i die daily we know he dies spiritually but he's also talking about the fact that he was submitted to that he's saying every day i go i could get stoned i could i've been thrown i've been thrown shipwrecked so many times i've been beaten he says every day i'm subject to death every day i'm ready and i'm prepared and he said for me to live is christ to die is gain he'd been through enough that he knew it didn't matter god was going to have his will god was going to do what he was going to do and at some point we have to come to that place we're going to be pruned we're going to be purged we're going to be cleansed and the soul doesn't need that the soul he's not putting our soul through that he's he's forming our character but our soul is saved we're perfect in his sight but job was perfect in his sight and he said hey devil here you go oh my now look he says hearing my father glorified that you bear much fruit so shall you be my disciples and again he doesn't leave you and come back later you abide in the vine so you have to be washed in order to bear fruit if you're not washed if you don't allow yourself to be washed by the word you will get dirty to a point where you have no testimony and people around you begin to see that's not what a christian does because you've refused to walk in the light you've refused to walk in the word you've refused to be corrected by the word and so your feet get dirty and you've seen it people that were real christians you knew they were a christian but something happened in their life and they just refused any longer to be corrected by the word and so they begin to wander their feet begin to wander god has a way of bringing us back doesn't he aren't you glad for the mercies of god we needed to be washed thirdly because we're going to be the wife of a king we're going to be the wife of the king and the wife of the king before she could come to the king had to be washed you find that in the story of esther that they washed your purifier for 12 months before she could come to the king and ezekiel in the old testament uses very vivid imagery to speak of the wife of jehovah constantly backsliding and it's just what you know as a wife israel wasn't a very good wife and the prophets point that out they were constantly if we could put it in the modern vernacular cheating on god committing adultery is the biblical term which i think we ought to use more often they were constantly committing adultery on god with other gods in ezekiel 16 8 if you go back and read the first few verses he talks about how that he found them like like a baby they've been born and cast away and uses the vivid imagery they were there in their own blood and and they hadn't even been cared for as a baby and he comes and he takes that little baby and he finds it he washes it and he cleans it up and he puts it and he takes care of it and lets somebody take care of it and then after a while it grows up and and in verse eight he said now when i passed by thee and looked upon thee behold thy time was a time of love in other words you were of an age where you could be married and he said and i spread my skirt over thee which that was the idiom for for being married he engaged to them cover thy nakedness yeah i swear unto thee enter into a covenant with thee saith the lord god thou became as mine then i washed thee with water yea i thoroughly washed away thy blood from thee and i anointed thee with oil all the uncleanness that they had done all the things that they'd been caught up in they were just like any other people they were just as prone to idolatry as any other people but god picked them up and he took care of them and then they grew to a certain age he married to them he said you're my wife you belong to me i'll take care of you he washed him with water he anointed them with oil he said i clothed the also embroidered work and shodzy with badger skin and i girded thee about with fine linen i covered thee with silk i decked you with ornaments i put bracelets on the hands a chain on my neck he's using this vivid imagery of a of an eastern wife that would be getting ready for a wedding he said thus without decked with gold and silver and thy rainbow was a fine linen and silk embroidered work that is to eat fine flour and honey and all that was succeeding beautiful thou just prosper into a kingdom thyroid now went forth among the heathen for thy beauty for it was perfect through my comeliness which i had put upon thee saith the lord god say you were beautiful because i made you beautiful don't ever forget that i got two beautiful girls i got three beautiful girls sitting back here but my two little daughters you're beautiful but you're beautiful because god made you beautiful if as a church we have any beauty it's because god made it that he said and it went all through the heathen it was perfect through my commonliness which i had put upon thee saith the lord god but thou didst trust in thine own beauty and place the harlot because of thy renown and poured out thy fornications on every one that passed by as it was that you just didn't settle for one god every one that come by you grabbed hold of it every time there was an opportunity to go and find another god you found them they refused to be washed they just stayed there like those doctors that refused to hear and and people died because of it but they just refused to be washed but see god wasn't going to leave it like that you're going to have a bride eve refused to be washed by the water of the word but he was going to have a bride would not refuse and so israel continually refused to be washed by the word but he would have a bride who would not refuse to be washed brother branham deals with that in the invisible union of the bride of christ i know you know these things but i want to just bring it to our remembrance tonight he said he the bridegroom took away your shame brought you out of the field where you were washed the blood off of you aren't you glad he did amen he took away your shame put it in the sea of forgetfulness by the washing of the water the word and the blood of life he said that's what the bible said your first husband that you were married to the world the anointed bridegroom which for ordained you has washed you by the washing of the water he said by the church he said no that don't sound right does it you might find that in the almanac but not in god's bible you're washed not by the church but by the washing of the water by the word in the word he said see you are standing completely justified as though you never did it at the beginning amen hallelujah oh they thought you know if we recognized that the blood was on our hands that we could say now i never did that i never handled the word that way because he said you didn't do it in the first place very bad he washed us he said put in the sea of forgetfulness amen he said and you are standing completely justified as so you never did it at the beginning said this is my message to the church now as we go off the air in just a minute you're standing if you're standing on god's word and with god's word every amen now notice what he says watch closely we want to be standing completely justified don't we then where do we have to be standing on god's word and with god's word the one goes with the other in order to be standing completely justified as though we never did it at the beginning amen we have to be standing on god's word and with god's word every amen every jot every tittle that's why it matters what we believe matters what we say behind this pulpit every man every jot every tittle because that's where we stand we got to stand on something how do you know you're justified if you can't believe the word if you can't stand on the word how can you ever have your sins forgiven you're trying to trust on the benevolence of a god that you're not sure if he'll really forgive you or not but we have an assurance that we know our sins are forgiven why because the word says it is not because we cried at altar and i i got nothing against that i i'll be the first one there many times i'll be the first one there but that's not how we know that we're saved we don't know we're saved because we jump or we shouted or we went through the prayer line or whatever it was we know we're saved because the word says the word says if we believe and are baptized we'll receive the gift of the holy ghost if we repent and are baptized the word says that then if i follow that prescription i pass through those waters of separation i've i've went into the holy of holies i've been there i've seen that's the kind of glory i'm standing on a rock you can't talk me out of that i can't talk you out of that i'm there and there might be times i need to have my feet washed there might be times i get dirt on me there might be times i get a bad attitude there might be times i get to mess with something i shouldn't be messing with but i know i can come right back to the water and i will not refuse to be washed because i'm his bride i will not refuse to stand in the word and on the word because i am his bride every child every child where are you standing he said i'm trying to tell you pull away from them shucks see you can't stand by them shucks and denominational systems and be on every word of god he said pull away from them shucks get out here in the wheat where you can get right before the sun i hear the coming of the combine very bad let me stop for just a moment listen people excuse me i'm losing my breath because i'm fat as i've told you before but you pray for your pastor that's some dirt i need to wash off somebody said amen he said he said get out in here in the wheat where you can get right before the sun i hear the coming of the combine you see some people's had to read that to get my train of thought back some people's religion is as flimsy as the next service well i'm not sure that i'm washed so i got to go to church to find out if i'm a christian and i believe in going to church more than anybody but i don't have to go here to find out i'm a christian i'm a christian because god says i am i'm a christian i'm his bride because he says i am and it doesn't rest on me going to enough meetings it doesn't rest on me no i want to go to meetings because i want to fellowship with god's people i want to hear god's word but my salvation don't rest on that my salvation doesn't rest on anything of this world your salvation does not rest on you going to this church as opposed to another one it's no more to you if you put your salvation in the church you're no different than the catholic who puts his salvation in the catholic church and so what but people are so flimsy to the point where you feel like they have you have to be re-saved and re-saved we ought to be able to hear the word straight and not have to be re-saved but we can hear the word we can say it could just let it wash us i don't have to redo the repentance that i've done in my life but let me be washed lord i can say amen to the word even if it's hard because i'm not deliberate i'm not going out here and just doing what the word says don't do right if i do that i'm not a christian he said well that's awful bold to say that it's the truth i sure don't have any influence of the holy spirit of my life if i can just walk down the road and do everything the word says don't do it just ignore it i've got blood on my hands i need to be cleansed but a christian can make mistakes but you come back you don't like if you're used to being clean you ever met somebody who hadn't been taken a bath in a long time you know if you go overseas forgive me but people are just different they just don't have the facility to take a bath every day and so you might walk up to somebody wearing a really nice suit and this really smells bad really smells bad why because they're just not used to it or they've gotten used to it they me i need a shower every morning i don't feel clean see as a believer you need to wash you need to be washed by the water of the word or you just don't feel clean there's something about it you're used to that amen and so brother brother says i hear the coming of the combine he said you're standing complete amen justify don't don't let anybody tell you that the bride is waiting on another prophet or another message to come because he said you're standing complete justified like you never did it in the first place hallelujah you're standing completely you never sinned at the first place god don't even know it's in the sea of forgetfulness hallelujah you never did it you were accused of it by the accuser but really from the beginning you were predestinated to be a son and daughter of god you're standing there washed your old book of divorcement is put away and it's dead absolutely out of existence even in the mind of god hallelujah you're the virtuous bride of christ washed in the blood of christ precious virtuous sinless son of god standing oh my we ought to be able to shout about something like this oh my he said standing with a pure unadulterated bride word that he washed by the water of his own blood that it become flesh and manifested that he might take you which were predestinated in the bosom of the father before the beginning the same as he was he was that great attribute of god called love whatever you are you're a servant of god whatever god wants you to do where your place is god placed in the church some apostles prophets teachers pastors he placed that by virtue of his own predestination you were that to begin with amen your first wedding was an old it was you've never done it in the first place because there's only one thing could do it that would be god come down himself took your place in a form of the son of god jesus christ washed you by the water of the washing of the water by the word amen the word not the denomination the word washed you the devil's telling me i'm overdoing it tonight but you know what i said last wednesday night i want to give the devil a black eye we've been doing it we've been doing it you're fighting every you know they say right now there's one third of all people who regularly went to church before this happened for the coven 19 thing come on don't go to church anymore and if you talk to denominational pastors they'll tell you most of them will never come back thank god that you've got a desire to be in the house of god there's something there and i know we we want to be careful we want to do everything that we can to be safe but there's something inside of you you want to be in the house of god why because you're his bride you want to be washed by the word he said but if you won't stand in the water of the word how are you going to be washed you're still as spotted as eve was and this is why i asked the question sunday do you want to be well because if you want to be well you have to stand in the word you got to stand under the water of the word and let it wash you let it correct you oh lord i i didn't realize that was wrong lord i repent of that i'm sorry lord that attitude that i had i know that don't match the attitude of christ let me let me get rid of that in my life those things that i've been doing that are wrong let me get rid of those things lord that that place where i don't that fear that i have that that that that worry that's taking over my life i know that's not god-like let me get rid of those things let me be washed by the word if i can't believe for my healing let the words of healing wash over me until i can believe again if i can't believe if i if i stand there because sin is unbelief and if i'm if i'm standing there let me be washed until i believe again if you won't stand in the water of the word how are you going to be washed you're still as spotted as if was oh dear dying lamb thy precious blood shall never lose its power till all the ransom church of god be saved to sin no more what is sin here he says that sin is unbelief unbelief in what the word unbelief in god which is the word pure he says unadulterated oh hallelujah leaving soon for the skies amen standing ready thank your garments washed by the water the bleeding word the word become blood amen the word become blood the blood said that was broken at calvary the word become blood he was the word the word become blood the word bled for you your washed and bleeding word the word bleeding the life of god in the word and the word was bled for you that you might be washed from the filth of these prostitutes be cleaned and sanctified by the washing of the water of the word that makes your mind and heart stayed on god and on his word what place are you standing in today are you standing in a place of less than full repentance if you are you can't be washed by the word standing a place of unconfessed sin you can't be washed by the word standing in a place of doing things you know is wrong you can't be washed by the word you have to submit yourself to the word it's not the things that you don't know it's the things you do know the things that i do know then we go through life and get dirty but the word is there and we don't have to worry about going to an old cistern to wash in we got good water and artesian well we don't have to worry we've got the good stuff doesn't make you feel better when you got the the branded uh germ-x i never thought they've come up with so much of that stuff now some of it don't smell very good some of it's got you know but you get the good stuff i got stuff some stuff back in my office i don't like to share and sister carl you may have left it back there but it's that that essential oils and i've kind of thought bad about that but this it's hand sanitizer that's made from essential oils that smells good that's the good stuff huh i got the good stuff and you know we we've got the good stuff we don't have to settle for the off brand we don't have to settle for a broken cistern why would we settle for some teacher out here somewhere trying to show us something we've had something been proved by god to be real why should we settle for some some false thing that comes up in the message and something come along and the wind blows this way and blows that way no i'm going to stay under the word i want to be washed the old pentecostals used to say musicians come the old pentecost did you say i want to stay under the spout where the glory comes out you ever heard them say that i want to stand on the spout where the glory comes out could i put it this way as the bride of christ i want to stay under the word i want to stay under that spout of the word to be washed by the water of the word you wanted evidence of the new birth it's a willingness to stay under that headship of the word to be washed by the word jesus said if i don't wash you you have no part in me esther says whatever you want me to wear i'll wear it look at her willingness look at mary she said be it unto me according to thy word whatever you have for me i want to fulfill that in my life and why does he do this he does it for the purpose of presenting to himself a sinless bride what a privilege to preach in this day i got thinking about this with alan today and i just it just it really got to me because i thought what a privilege to preach in this day because we preached sometimes to the eternal lost we know that but we also preach to a bride that can't fall and paul in that first church age preached to a bride that would fall preached to a bride that had to go go into the ground like a seed had to fall into the ground so it could be restored but we preached to a bride somewhere there's a bride i believe we're here tonight i believe this is a part of that bride somewhere there's a bride who will not fall from her position who will not fall into into into ungodliness who will not fall into unbelief but who will be restored all the way back who has been restored all the way back who's washed in the blood of the lamb aren't you glad you serve a god like that would you bow your heads with me what a privilege to preach in this day to be able to preach to you it's a bride who can be washed i don't have to worry about a hotbed plan or something i'm hurting your feelings every time i stand up here but i i know i've been washed by the word and i know you've been washed by the word you're willing to be washed by the word so you just if it's the word you take it if it's just me you leave it alone because you're his bride you're his bride i'm so grateful for that it gives me great courage and confidence to preach ought to give every one of us great courage and confidence to live to live our lives every day it may not be a hundred percent but i can be washed all i got to do is go down and find the fountain and i know where it's at i've got the good stuff i don't have to worry about going to some denomination from denomination to denomination from place to place i've got the good stuff don't have to worry about finding the best preacher the best the biggest church i've got the good stuff the message of the hour washes me daily the message of the hour that i've received it comes in my heart and begins to move through me and wash me from everything of the world and the things that i go through is just a purging in my life and sometimes it's hard it's almost impossibly hard i watch what some of you have been through and i think it's almost impossibly hard how could you sit here today i don't know i don't know what i would do if i'd been through what you've been through but i know this that he is able to keep you and paul says i i know in whom i have believed you've been through impossibly hard times but you sit here tonight because you know i believed in a god who's able to keep what i've committed to him against that day i'm standing under a message churches may come and go preachers may come and go people may come and go but i'm standing under the word of god and it don't matter whether anybody else does i can stand there and be washed i don't have to rely on anybody else i can be washed by the water of the word aren't you grateful for that today this is not a message of condemnation it's a message of grace and of hope and of joy i've been washed by the water of the word and i don't have to if i mess up today i don't have to go back and get re-saved i've been washed i can be washed lord wash my feet wash my feet tonight let me be cleansed let the word that i've heard tonight just come into my heart and sing down wash my feet let me let me wherever i go be a christian let me be a christian a church and a christian to my neighbor and a christian my friend and a christian we're down the street the christian wherever i go i wanna i want my feet to be washed i wanna be ready i want to be walking wherever i go according to the will of god heavenly father lord jesus this is my desire tonight i see you moving lord in our church and i'm so thankful lord i realize that you don't you don't owe us anything it's not as if we've lived so perfectly and done so well that you just would have to do things for us but lord even even though we mess up even though we're not perfect lord and at times when we're going through the purging time and we've lost a loved one or we've had struggles in our lives sometimes we don't understand we don't see a purpose in it we don't we don't feel the reason and we get lord even in our own heart we begin to question or we come back to be washed by the water of the word to say lord even though even if you kill me i still serve you even if even if i lose everything i'll still serve you [Music] even if every person that lives in this world gives up and every person turns away from the gospel i'll still serve you lord i'll still serve you i'll still love you because there's something about me that wants to be your bride wants to be washed father would you grant it for us today wash our feet lord help us father as christians to be real christians extend our influence lord to the communities that we live in oh god as i prayed lord that this church would be a place where a sinner could come in and feel when they walked in the doors that this is where the people of god meet together they could feel the presence of god here may it be so god may it be like it was tonight when we come and we just feel the presence of god maybe so every service not because the feeling is here but because we came to be washed and that feeling comes with that that feeling of cleanness that feeling of cleansing thank you for it lord cleanse us from our unbelief god cleanse us from our our own ways and our desires whatever you do for us lord whatever you allow us to go through we'll serve you anyway we're so grateful lord for all you've done continue to work lord work in our church god smooth through every family lord i pray you do

god we know we can't do it on our own none of us can do it on our own but i'll fail i talk a lot about responsibility and accountability but i can't do it lord i need you to do it i need you to do it i need you to walk in me walk through every pew tonight lord every home that's watching i pray you'd grant it now in jesus name amen hallelujah don't you love him tonight would you just stand and

that that what god what jesus did i think the main thing to remember is there is that we couldn't do it for ourselves amen that's that's the thing we've got to remember you know as we do that in remembrance of him it's not that i can wash you or you can wash me but it's we couldn't do it for ourselves amen and no matter what the covid pandemic says we can't we can't wash our own feet we can't
