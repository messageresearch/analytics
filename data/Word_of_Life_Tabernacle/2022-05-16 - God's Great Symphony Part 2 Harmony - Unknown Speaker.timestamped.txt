[55:14] amen
[55:16] amen good to have you back this
[55:18] afternoon matthew chapter 18 and verse
[55:20] 19.
[55:22] matthew 18 and 19. i'd like to continue
[55:24] on our thought of god's great symphony
[55:27] and tonight we're going to talk about
[55:28] harmony
[55:30] harmony
[55:31] and i trust it'll be a
[55:33] blessing to you while you're turning
[55:35] there matthew 18 19.
[55:38] there's some services coming up at the
[55:40] end of the month
[55:41] uh in the area and i wanted to remind
[55:43] you of that i haven't i've forgotten to
[55:45] mention it
[55:46] but brother ivy has meetings always on
[55:48] memorial day weekend we're going to try
[55:50] to go over there we'll be back for
[55:52] sunday
[55:53] but we'll be trying to be in those
[55:54] services brother craig bower will be
[55:56] there
[55:57] and also some missionary brothers
[55:59] they've kind of turned that into a
[56:00] missionary type meeting so i'm sure
[56:03] they'd appreciate it if any of you can
[56:05] make it over
[56:06] and then a little closer but brother
[56:08] danny steeman i believe june 3rd through
[56:11] 5th will be at brother jason jackson's
[56:14] and brother danny's a good preacher and
[56:16] i'm sure it'd be a blessing
[56:17] to them for some of us to go and and
[56:19] also be a blessing to you here and
[56:21] brother danny and so you're welcome to
[56:23] do that as well and i just wanted to
[56:25] remind you of those things then towards
[56:27] the end of the month brother andrew
[56:29] glover is going to stop by and see us
[56:31] and i'll let you know about that during
[56:32] a week
[56:33] and then brother
[56:36] john baduca will be here as well after
[56:38] memorial day
[56:39] with us like he was last year so looking
[56:42] forward to those things isn't god good
[56:44] to us
[56:46] matthew chapter 18 and verse 19 again i
[56:48] say unto you that if two of you
[56:51] shall agree on earth as touching
[56:54] anything
[56:55] that they shall ask
[56:57] it shall be done for them of my father
[56:59] which is in heaven if two of you shall
[57:03] agree
[57:04] on earth amen i believe that's the word
[57:07] of god amen amen
[57:09] you may be seated
[57:14] i think it's an understatement to say
[57:15] that people don't always get along
[57:20] mark twain once said he said i built a
[57:22] cage and in it i put a dog and a cat
[57:26] after a little training i got the dog
[57:27] and the cat to the point that
[57:29] lived peaceably together
[57:31] then i introduced a pig a goat a
[57:33] kangaroo some birds and a monkey
[57:36] after a few adjustments they learned to
[57:38] live in harmony together good thing it
[57:40] wasn't that
[57:41] anything in there wanted to eat the
[57:43] other one but
[57:44] he said they learned to live in harmony
[57:46] he said i was so encouraged by that that
[57:48] i
[57:48] i added an irish catholic a presbyterian
[57:52] a jew a muslim and a buddhist from china
[57:55] along with a baptist missionary i
[57:57] captured on the same trip
[58:00] he said in a very short time there
[58:02] wasn't a single living thing in that
[58:04] cage
[58:10] and we're as christians we're called to
[58:11] live peaceably with all men aren't we
[58:13] the bible says
[58:15] as we look at god's great symphony you
[58:17] know music's not written randomly
[58:20] but there's laws to it
[58:22] and those laws have not been invented
[58:24] they've been discovered
[58:26] right there's already a law of what
[58:29] sounds pleasant to the ear and they can
[58:31] take that break it down into mathematics
[58:33] and and break it down into
[58:35] into laws and
[58:37] and then uh so music is very
[58:40] mathematical and as i understand i don't
[58:42] understand the music theory as a whole
[58:44] but just a very little that i do
[58:46] understand it's very mathematical
[58:48] and so there those laws are discovered
[58:51] to be there they're already there like
[58:52] the law of gravity or something like
[58:54] that
[58:55] and when those laws are broken you know
[58:56] what you get you get heavy metal music
[59:00] music that don't sound good
[59:03] and actually it's very true that rock
[59:06] and roll music actually breaks the some
[59:09] of those laws what chords should come
[59:11] next and things like that and then when
[59:13] it becomes extreme like that it actually
[59:15] sounds bad and then bad is good
[59:18] and so it kind of turns around on itself
[59:21] but
[59:22] good to some people anyway not to me
[59:25] but one of the laws of music is called
[59:27] harmony
[59:28] harmony harmony is a combination
[59:31] of simultaneously sounded musical notes
[59:34] to produce chords and chord progressions
[59:37] that have a pleasing effect
[59:40] harmony is actually what injects melody
[59:43] with emotion
[59:44] and and what that means is if you just
[59:47] played the melody to a song if uh if
[59:49] you're a piano player it would be the
[59:51] right hand and left hand and if you just
[59:54] uh and just play the melody there's
[59:57] little emotion to it but if you play the
[59:58] harmony with it it produces a feeling
[1:00:02] gives you a feeling and so and it
[1:00:04] actually adds what's called undertones
[1:00:06] or things in the music that can't be
[1:00:08] heard in the notes separately it
[1:00:10] actually produces a sound beyond just
[1:00:13] the noise made by the two notes
[1:00:16] but together the two notes will actually
[1:00:19] produce more music than they do by
[1:00:21] themselves
[1:00:23] each of them themselves does that make
[1:00:25] sense so you're not just adding two and
[1:00:27] that's a scriptural principle as well
[1:00:29] you know one will put a hundred to
[1:00:31] flight to a thousand or whatever that is
[1:00:34] it doesn't go up by it doesn't double it
[1:00:36] goes up by tenfold
[1:00:39] right and so
[1:00:40] we find that music together actually
[1:00:44] produces a sound that you can't get
[1:00:47] unless you have the two notes together
[1:00:49] without harmony you have a bunch of
[1:00:51] notes which are pleasing in themselves
[1:00:53] but when you put them together say in
[1:00:55] the wrong way they're discordant that's
[1:00:58] that's a word that's used in the music
[1:01:00] discordant discord we would say it
[1:01:02] harmony discord are also used to
[1:01:04] fellowship and i'm going to use them in
[1:01:06] that way tonight as well but but they
[1:01:08] sound terrible uh discordant in in
[1:01:11] gospel music we have something called
[1:01:13] four-part harmony it's actually a
[1:01:15] classical music thing in the classical
[1:01:17] world it's a four-part harmony was
[1:01:19] played on four different instruments or
[1:01:21] perhaps with four different voices and
[1:01:23] was written
[1:01:24] uh with uh with a tenor and an alto and
[1:01:26] a soprano and a bass uh voice and in
[1:01:30] gospel music they've taken that and
[1:01:32] they've got the tenor and the baritone
[1:01:35] and the bass and the lead singer and
[1:01:38] those four
[1:01:39] notes they're all singing the same song
[1:01:42] they're all using the same music but
[1:01:44] they're actually singing
[1:01:46] different parts to that music and i'm
[1:01:48] going somewhere tonight so just hang
[1:01:50] with me okay
[1:01:52] now they're they're pleasing in
[1:01:53] themselves but when they're played in a
[1:01:55] discordant way they sound awful and
[1:01:57] that's why you play certain notes
[1:01:59] together to make a chord and there's
[1:02:01] seven notes within a chord you play one
[1:02:04] of those notes to get those notes
[1:02:06] together or in some relation to one
[1:02:08] another and they sound good i there was
[1:02:11] a group called the cathedrals years ago
[1:02:12] that did a song called heaven's parade
[1:02:15] and they showed what it would sound like
[1:02:16] they would sing each part by itself
[1:02:18] separately some of you may remember that
[1:02:20] and it sounded
[1:02:22] not very good when each one would sing
[1:02:24] it separately but you put it all
[1:02:25] together it sounds pretty good
[1:02:27] and it but it's different you would
[1:02:28] never sing that way singing solo
[1:02:31] right because there it's meant to be
[1:02:33] together
[1:02:35] and so and i mentioned this this morning
[1:02:37] but pleasant music pleases our neurons
[1:02:40] it actually
[1:02:41] actually triggers something in the brain
[1:02:44] that sweet sounds carry more information
[1:02:46] than harsh ones and since the time of
[1:02:49] the ancient greeks people have known
[1:02:50] that two tones whose frequencies were
[1:02:52] related by simple ratio and i'm maybe
[1:02:55] getting a little bit too
[1:02:56] deep for myself here tonight but just
[1:02:58] hang with me as i said that if you get
[1:03:00] two sounds that are in a two-one ratio
[1:03:03] or a three-two which is a perfect fifth
[1:03:06] so if they're in the same octave or in
[1:03:07] the same or related to one another by
[1:03:10] fifths in the music that they produce
[1:03:12] the most pleasing or consonant musical
[1:03:14] intervals and that effect doesn't depend
[1:03:16] on musical training in other words you
[1:03:18] hear that you don't know that
[1:03:20] necessarily but you hear it
[1:03:22] right and people that play by ear like
[1:03:24] sister carla or
[1:03:25] many of our musicians mostly play by ear
[1:03:28] they're not reading notes but they can
[1:03:29] hear when it sounds wrong
[1:03:31] and anticipate what the next one would
[1:03:34] be
[1:03:34] because they're playing the chord and
[1:03:36] they can hear the difference now so it
[1:03:38] doesn't depend on musical training even
[1:03:39] infants have been shown that they know
[1:03:41] the difference in music when it's played
[1:03:44] wrong
[1:03:46] or when it's sung wrong or in other
[1:03:47] words when the chord doesn't follow
[1:03:49] correctly or the notes aren't together
[1:03:52] and monkeys can even hear the difference
[1:03:55] it's just it's just the way it is it's a
[1:03:57] law of music
[1:03:58] and so and again i'm i'm i'm relaying a
[1:04:01] background for something and i won't
[1:04:03] hold you too long tonight but if you'll
[1:04:04] show
[1:04:05] that next slide i think i put yeah i put
[1:04:07] the circle of fifths is what this is
[1:04:09] called
[1:04:10] and so you can see that the keys are in
[1:04:12] relation to one another so if you played
[1:04:14] in c you'd be in c f and g it's right
[1:04:17] together
[1:04:18] right it works together to make up the
[1:04:21] chord
[1:04:22] and and then you can set a mood by what
[1:04:25] music is played you know god doesn't
[1:04:27] want everything to be the same yeah
[1:04:29] right and so when you look at music
[1:04:31] music can go make you feel happier can
[1:04:33] make you feel sad the major keys make
[1:04:35] you feel happy the sun's coming up the
[1:04:37] minor keys make you feel sad the sun's
[1:04:38] going down right but sometimes there's a
[1:04:41] purpose for that many of the psalms if
[1:04:43] you go back and play them in a minor key
[1:04:45] you can kind of get the feeling or the
[1:04:46] emotion that david was going through
[1:04:50] right and so there's a there's there's a
[1:04:52] relation there and if you put those
[1:04:53] together in a proper way and a good
[1:04:55] musician it's just somebody who has the
[1:04:57] feeling or the or the ability to put
[1:04:59] those things together
[1:05:00] in a proper way and in a way that maybe
[1:05:02] they think outside the box and but it's
[1:05:05] still related together it's within that
[1:05:07] law but to be discordant is to actually
[1:05:10] break that law so that next slide is a
[1:05:13] harmony line just so that you can see it
[1:05:15] if you know how to read a line of music
[1:05:17] that the uh that the notes you see the
[1:05:19] single notes whenever you have more than
[1:05:20] one note stacked on top of each other
[1:05:22] that's harmony
[1:05:24] right and so that's what we are as a
[1:05:26] church
[1:05:29] right
[1:05:29] that don't make any sense to anybody
[1:05:31] does it
[1:05:33] right you alone you're you're down here
[1:05:36] you're you're playing one note
[1:05:38] as a church you're playing at the same
[1:05:40] time
[1:05:42] right but you don't necessarily
[1:05:44] play the same thing as you would when
[1:05:46] you were playing one note but when
[1:05:48] together you're you're listening for the
[1:05:50] other person you're you're hearing the
[1:05:53] other part
[1:05:55] and and together it sounds good but if
[1:05:58] it's discordant it sounds harsh and
[1:06:00] jarring now we know as we said this
[1:06:02] morning that the word is the music the
[1:06:04] sheet music is that right yeah and the
[1:06:06] holy spirit is the conductor and we are
[1:06:08] playing the parts yes
[1:06:11] right but our part by itself would be
[1:06:13] okay
[1:06:14] it would it'd sound good if we all sing
[1:06:16] solo by ourselves but if we all sing
[1:06:19] solo together it don't sound good
[1:06:22] now i'm not talking about music music
[1:06:24] and singing tonight as much as i am
[1:06:25] about the way we live our lives and the
[1:06:27] way we treat one another and the way
[1:06:29] that we relate to the word of god right
[1:06:32] because really you want to harmonize
[1:06:34] more than even what you want to
[1:06:35] harmonize with one another but you've
[1:06:36] got to harmonize with god who is the
[1:06:38] word
[1:06:39] you've got to stay in harmony with him
[1:06:42] and with the way that with the with the
[1:06:43] music as it's written so we're playing a
[1:06:46] part and and the sound the full sound
[1:06:48] that the composer of the music called
[1:06:51] for comes through harmony
[1:06:54] because now let's go back to matthew 18
[1:06:56] 19 if you can go back to that esther my
[1:06:58] my scripture the text that i read it
[1:07:00] says again i say unto you if two of you
[1:07:02] shall agree shall agree
[1:07:04] notice that word that word is symphony
[1:07:07] symphony agree
[1:07:09] it's symphony to be of one mind
[1:07:12] to agree together to play together
[1:07:14] right to be an orchestra
[1:07:17] if two of you will be an orchestra if
[1:07:19] two of you in other words will play in
[1:07:21] harmony
[1:07:22] right where you can't all be first
[1:07:24] filing or second violin you can't all be
[1:07:26] you can't all play the same note
[1:07:29] but if two of you shall agree and the
[1:07:31] one that every note is important i've
[1:07:33] always thought about the man with the
[1:07:35] symbols you know he stands there and
[1:07:36] maybe he's not used all through the
[1:07:38] whole the whole musical play or whatever
[1:07:41] that it is but at the very end of it
[1:07:44] he'll maybe use one time and that's it
[1:07:47] right he just kind of collapses his
[1:07:49] symbols together and that's it but he
[1:07:51] but he's needful
[1:07:53] he's necessary
[1:07:55] there was a famous there's a famous
[1:07:56] piece that was written and i can't
[1:07:58] remember the name of it but it actually
[1:07:59] uses real cannons
[1:08:02] and it don't hardly sound the same
[1:08:04] unless you use real cannons
[1:08:06] and so every once in a while they'll get
[1:08:08] real cannons and play this piece you can
[1:08:09] find it on youtube where they actually
[1:08:11] have they play the music and during the
[1:08:13] music at one point because he's the
[1:08:15] musical the story is telling us of a war
[1:08:18] right and so during that war there's
[1:08:20] cannon fire and it actually fits in with
[1:08:23] the music but they wait during and they
[1:08:25] only play one time the the cannons go
[1:08:27] off and that's all but it's part of it
[1:08:30] and so you may just be the cannon fire
[1:08:32] that goes off once in a while but you're
[1:08:34] part of the music
[1:08:36] right now so that symphony is is to
[1:08:39] agree shall agree be in complete accord
[1:08:41] like the notes of a perfect strain of
[1:08:43] music
[1:08:44] and so one man's infirmity is upheld by
[1:08:46] another's strength one man's
[1:08:48] short-sightedness is compensated by
[1:08:50] another's wider view one man's little
[1:08:53] faith overpowered by another man's firm
[1:08:55] confidence
[1:08:56] we were meant to play if i could put it
[1:08:58] that way or or sing or or live or
[1:09:01] manifest the word together
[1:09:04] not not just separately
[1:09:07] does that make sense
[1:09:10] now in the scripture again the two of
[1:09:12] you shall agree it's the word is
[1:09:14] literally symphonized or harmonized
[1:09:17] it's a metaphor taken from a number of
[1:09:19] musical instruments set to the same key
[1:09:21] playing the same tune it means a perfect
[1:09:23] agreement of the hearts desires wishes
[1:09:25] and voices two or more persons praying
[1:09:27] to god
[1:09:29] it intimates that as a number of musical
[1:09:31] instruments skillfully played in a good
[1:09:33] concert or pleasing to the ears of men
[1:09:35] so a number of people united together in
[1:09:38] prayer
[1:09:40] if two of you will agree on one thing
[1:09:42] yes you realize the power of that that's
[1:09:44] pleasing to god
[1:09:46] he said if two of you will symphonize
[1:09:48] well harmonize that will be pleasing in
[1:09:50] the ears
[1:09:52] of the lord
[1:09:53] but in order to harmonize many times you
[1:09:55] must learn to listen
[1:09:58] and to the other voice and especially if
[1:10:00] you do it by ear you've got to learn to
[1:10:03] listen
[1:10:04] so that you can sing
[1:10:06] that's the biggest part the biggest
[1:10:08] reason why we have disagreements is
[1:10:09] people don't listen
[1:10:12] now think about it they're not listening
[1:10:14] and so you're trying to sing your part
[1:10:16] and and he's trying to sing his part and
[1:10:19] both of you together are seeing
[1:10:20] something that may be good may be true
[1:10:22] but it doesn't fit together
[1:10:24] and when you come together whether it's
[1:10:26] in a marriage or whether it's in a
[1:10:28] church you you have to listen to the
[1:10:30] other part and sing a part that would be
[1:10:32] complimentary to that
[1:10:34] not overriding it
[1:10:37] right not singing a solo
[1:10:39] god's not asking you to be the same
[1:10:42] but sometimes you've got to listen to
[1:10:44] the other voice
[1:10:45] and let it be dominant when the music
[1:10:47] calls for it
[1:10:49] right
[1:10:50] let it because there's always a dominant
[1:10:52] voice he's not asking us to be the same
[1:10:54] but to complement one another brother
[1:10:56] brown said i believe that god is a god
[1:10:57] of variety the world proves that he's
[1:10:59] got big mountains and little mountains
[1:11:01] he complains he's got deserts he's got
[1:11:03] different things because he made it the
[1:11:05] way he wanted it
[1:11:06] he made the season summer winter spring
[1:11:09] and autumn he made the season it shows
[1:11:10] he's a god of variety he made you in a
[1:11:12] variety some men are real blusterous
[1:11:16] some are real dogmatic i'm not in this
[1:11:18] smaller crowd i'm not going to get into
[1:11:19] who's who this tonight
[1:11:22] others are fine
[1:11:23] others are kind
[1:11:25] fine you know they're just real uh real
[1:11:28] gentlemen others are kind and you just
[1:11:30] find all different kinds of people
[1:11:33] in his kingdom
[1:11:35] it's different instruments
[1:11:37] right to be played at different times in
[1:11:39] different ways but sometimes he wants
[1:11:40] two or three to be played together
[1:11:43] right and in that moment when it's not
[1:11:45] your solo that's the time when you've
[1:11:47] got to learn to play with other people
[1:11:51] right well it's me and my family i'll do
[1:11:52] what's best for my family that's not the
[1:11:54] way a church is run
[1:11:56] right you got to learn to listen to
[1:11:58] what's going on and and and bow yourself
[1:12:01] to that and when it comes to the bigger
[1:12:03] picture to the word we've got to learn
[1:12:05] to do that
[1:12:06] right to play we know we don't play solo
[1:12:08] even other churches and i you know i'm
[1:12:11] not complaining but just me myself i
[1:12:13] think lord help me to be a compliment to
[1:12:15] another church if there's another
[1:12:17] message church that preaches the same i
[1:12:18] don't want to clash against them all the
[1:12:20] time let me be a compliment
[1:12:23] right where we can play the harmony part
[1:12:25] let's play the harmony part where we can
[1:12:27] play the solo part it's our meeting it's
[1:12:29] our time let's do that
[1:12:31] right but we want to be a compliment
[1:12:33] when you go to another meeting or you go
[1:12:34] to another church we're fixing to take a
[1:12:37] trip if the lord wills it overseas and
[1:12:40] if he allows us to go and when you go
[1:12:42] you want to be a compliment you go and
[1:12:43] find out what's going on and you
[1:12:45] compliment that you don't you don't go
[1:12:47] in and just and just tear it apart
[1:12:50] most of the time you're there not to
[1:12:52] sing a solo but to be a compliment
[1:12:55] now look
[1:12:56] he's got different things because he
[1:12:58] wants different things he made men and
[1:12:59] women differently genesis 2 18 and the
[1:13:01] lord god said it's not good the man
[1:13:03] should be alone i'll make him a help
[1:13:05] meet for him
[1:13:07] help meet for him so it's like adam is
[1:13:09] out there he's singing league
[1:13:12] and god listened to that
[1:13:16] he said there's something wrong with the
[1:13:17] song it needs a harmony part
[1:13:21] right he's singing a good lead he's
[1:13:23] walking out there singing oh you know
[1:13:25] whatever it is that's a bad song in it
[1:13:27] but he could he could sing lead
[1:13:30] but god said it needed a harmony part
[1:13:33] and so god created that you know
[1:13:35] ladies usually do pretty good on the
[1:13:37] harmony part on a psalm many times and
[1:13:39] many ladies sing a great lead part as
[1:13:41] well but i've noticed that it seems more
[1:13:44] natural for women to be able to sing a
[1:13:45] harmony apart and and i think women were
[1:13:48] created for that reason
[1:13:50] they they're singing the harmony part in
[1:13:52] the marriage
[1:13:53] right when the marriage is right
[1:13:55] and so genesis 2 and 20 says adam gave
[1:13:58] names to all the cattle and the fowl of
[1:13:59] the air and every beast of the field but
[1:14:01] for adam there was not found a help meet
[1:14:03] for him that help meet is his
[1:14:06] counterpart it's a hebrew word means
[1:14:07] counterpart a help suitable to him a
[1:14:10] wife
[1:14:11] but this is not limited to husbands and
[1:14:13] wives i want to look at it in
[1:14:14] perspective of the church because then
[1:14:16] the hebrew name eliezer if you ever
[1:14:17] heard of the name eliezer
[1:14:20] i'm trying to get you to respond tonight
[1:14:21] i know that you're
[1:14:22] dead tired
[1:14:24] we'll rush through it but the name
[1:14:25] eliezer is derived from the hebrews the
[1:14:28] reason why i give these young men these
[1:14:29] afternoon services
[1:14:31] a lot of times but you know
[1:14:34] his counterpart and and eliezer was a
[1:14:37] counterpart and his name literally means
[1:14:39] god is help moses named his son that
[1:14:42] and then you find abraham's servant name
[1:14:44] that eliezer
[1:14:46] it's god is help
[1:14:48] it's not just that
[1:14:50] eve was a help meet for adam but god had
[1:14:53] an attribute that wasn't displayed fully
[1:14:55] in adam alone
[1:14:57] even though he had eve in him
[1:14:59] you understand but in that format god
[1:15:01] see sometimes god has to break you
[1:15:03] before he can remake you what he wants
[1:15:04] you to be
[1:15:06] that's a there's a great truth in that
[1:15:09] huh
[1:15:10] and so he had to do surgery on that and
[1:15:12] he had to separate him and able to make
[1:15:13] him what he wanted him to be
[1:15:15] so he separates adam eve from adam and
[1:15:18] in separating her she become the harmony
[1:15:20] part she become the complementary part
[1:15:22] that's to help meet for him
[1:15:24] but now
[1:15:26] it's not just that but that was an
[1:15:28] attribute of god so it's not just it's
[1:15:30] not that he's an attribute of god and
[1:15:31] she's a second thought
[1:15:33] right that well we'll just have to do
[1:15:35] this because it didn't work the first
[1:15:36] time but she was also an attribute of
[1:15:38] god
[1:15:39] and it was an attribute of help
[1:15:42] and it's a gift in the church
[1:15:44] do you know that
[1:15:46] to be a help first corinthians 12 28 god
[1:15:48] has sent some in the church first
[1:15:50] apostles secondarily prophets thirdly
[1:15:52] teachers after that miracles and gifts
[1:15:55] of healing oh it sounds good doesn't it
[1:15:56] wouldn't you want to be a prophet or a
[1:15:58] teacher or a miracle worker or had a
[1:16:00] gift of healing helps
[1:16:04] helps
[1:16:05] governments
[1:16:06] whether it helps in governments healths
[1:16:08] and governments are people who assist
[1:16:10] the prophets and the pastors and the
[1:16:12] evangelists and the teachers
[1:16:14] right and assist the church assist one
[1:16:16] another
[1:16:18] helps governments diversities of tongues
[1:16:22] the greek word is
[1:16:23] it refers to assisting people in need
[1:16:26] but it also has the idea of calling on
[1:16:28] god in a time of turmoil so that he can
[1:16:31] act in the situation with his full power
[1:16:33] and force some people are given a gift
[1:16:35] of help they call on god a gift to pray
[1:16:38] a gift to help the church in that way a
[1:16:40] gift to show up at church some people
[1:16:42] have a knack for that a gift for that a
[1:16:45] gift to be there a gift to be a help to
[1:16:47] the pastor a gift to be a help to the
[1:16:49] musicians maybe they're not a musician
[1:16:51] but they're a help maybe they're not a
[1:16:53] pastor but they're a help maybe they're
[1:16:54] not an evangelist but they're a help to
[1:16:56] an evangelist
[1:16:58] right it's a gift it's an attribute of
[1:17:00] god which is what the gifts are you
[1:17:01] remember the gifts are off of the great
[1:17:03] diamond the great diamonds there and
[1:17:05] when every when the light strikes in a
[1:17:07] certain way and it spreads the prism
[1:17:09] brother random calls it that's the gifts
[1:17:11] that come off those light rays that come
[1:17:13] off of the great diamond then what what
[1:17:15] is it the help is one of those
[1:17:16] attributes one of those light rays first
[1:17:19] corinthians 12 29 are all apostles are
[1:17:21] all prophets they're all teachers or all
[1:17:23] workers of miracles have all the gifts
[1:17:25] of healing they all speak with tongues
[1:17:27] do all interpret but covet earnestly the
[1:17:29] best gifts
[1:17:30] he said and yet i show unto you a more
[1:17:32] excellent way
[1:17:34] than coveting the best gifts
[1:17:36] right he's not saying there won't be any
[1:17:38] more gifts but i'm going to show you a
[1:17:39] more excellent way than coveting the
[1:17:40] best gifts he said though i speak with
[1:17:42] the tongues of men and angels and have
[1:17:44] not charity or love and become as a
[1:17:46] sounding brass or a tinkling symbol
[1:17:48] though i have the gift of prophecy
[1:17:49] understand all mysteries and all
[1:17:50] knowledge i have all faith so that i
[1:17:52] could so that i could remove mountains
[1:17:54] and have not charity i am nothing notice
[1:17:56] what he types it to he says though i
[1:17:58] have not though i speak with the tongues
[1:18:00] of men and angels and i don't have
[1:18:01] charity i'm discordant
[1:18:04] right i'm a sounding brass
[1:18:07] i'm a tinkling symbol i'm out of order
[1:18:10] right
[1:18:11] without love i'm out of order
[1:18:14] oh god help us to realize that today if
[1:18:16] i preach without love i'm out of order
[1:18:19] if i if i prophesy without love i'm out
[1:18:22] of order if the things the things that i
[1:18:24] do if i do it without love i'm out of
[1:18:26] order i'm discordant i become a sounding
[1:18:28] brass or a tinkling symbol
[1:18:31] without divine love the gifts or even
[1:18:33] the gifts of god are discordant the
[1:18:35] brandon's asked a question and questions
[1:18:36] and answers can you have the holy ghost
[1:18:38] without the signs following immediately
[1:18:40] i'm paraphrasing that but that's
[1:18:42] basically what they're saying the ram
[1:18:43] said now the holy spirit appoints these
[1:18:45] offices but when you try to force
[1:18:47] yourself into it he said if i had to eat
[1:18:50] cherry pie what if cherry pie made you
[1:18:52] vomit
[1:18:53] i hope you didn't have cherry pie today
[1:18:57] he said you're hurt you're hurting
[1:18:58] yourself
[1:19:00] that's the way you try to do when you
[1:19:01] try to force yourself to do something
[1:19:03] that's contrary to the spirit so he's
[1:19:05] answering this question he's saying that
[1:19:08] and brother branham deals with it as if
[1:19:10] he says it's in the group
[1:19:12] right wherever there's a group of god's
[1:19:14] people you'll find these gifts
[1:19:16] but it's in the group not on any one
[1:19:17] individual so one individual may not be
[1:19:20] the pastor or the evangelist or the
[1:19:22] prophet or the teacher or the helps
[1:19:25] right but it's in the group
[1:19:27] and the signs follow the group but the
[1:19:29] brahman said the signs follow them that
[1:19:30] believe
[1:19:32] right the signs follow the group
[1:19:34] not necessarily the individual although
[1:19:36] they will
[1:19:37] but but it's the group it's individuals
[1:19:39] that make up a group one might have a
[1:19:41] sign follow him of of healing another
[1:19:43] one casting out devils another one of
[1:19:45] speaking in tongues but it's all in the
[1:19:47] group you understand
[1:19:49] let me understand that tonight
[1:19:51] i'm gonna have you start standing up in
[1:19:52] a minute so
[1:19:55] but brother brown said if you try to
[1:19:56] force it you're hurting yourself
[1:19:59] and he said
[1:20:01] so can you imagine now
[1:20:03] think about it for a minute as i said
[1:20:04] adam had that great voice
[1:20:07] but he was singing solo and so god said
[1:20:09] it's it's lacking something and maybe
[1:20:12] even the soloist would have to in order
[1:20:14] to sing a harmony part would have to
[1:20:16] alter his voice because out of him was
[1:20:19] taking something and then it would made
[1:20:21] eve and so he even altered his voice and
[1:20:24] she altered hers so that it would fit
[1:20:26] together just like when you get married
[1:20:28] and you alter your ways and she alters
[1:20:30] hers and it fits together it becomes
[1:20:33] something entirely new
[1:20:35] right and so can you imagine how that
[1:20:37] sounded to god
[1:20:39] he said this is it
[1:20:41] it's perfect we know he thought it was
[1:20:43] perfect because he said it's very good
[1:20:46] right he's very good and then he he
[1:20:49] strives to recreate that all through
[1:20:51] time until finally he does with christ
[1:20:53] and his bride back in the garden of eden
[1:20:55] again
[1:20:56] that's his threefold purpose the third
[1:20:58] fold of his threefold purpose is to go
[1:21:00] back to that condition that was pleasing
[1:21:02] to god
[1:21:04] right now
[1:21:05] what about look at look at that they
[1:21:07] were in perfect harmony what about when
[1:21:08] this bride on the earth was in an upper
[1:21:10] room and the bible says when the day of
[1:21:12] pentecost was fully come they were all
[1:21:14] with one accord in one place
[1:21:17] amen they were with one accord in one
[1:21:19] place
[1:21:20] and that harmony began to exist again
[1:21:23] can you imagine how he must have felt
[1:21:26] when he heard that when he saw that i'm
[1:21:28] typing it so that you'll understand it's
[1:21:30] as if they were singing
[1:21:33] it was beautiful like a choir
[1:21:36] oh i believe that same thing brother
[1:21:38] branham taught us this harmony exists
[1:21:40] again at the end time
[1:21:42] that the great symphony all comes
[1:21:44] together at the end he said this he said
[1:21:46] notice what harmony jesus never did
[1:21:49] anything until scene of the father or
[1:21:51] the father showed him first harmony
[1:21:53] between god and christ
[1:21:55] he said so will the bride
[1:21:58] amen and he shows her his word of life
[1:22:01] he shows her and she receives it she
[1:22:04] never doubts it don't you want to be
[1:22:05] somebody like that tonight she never
[1:22:07] doubts that nothing can harm her not
[1:22:09] even death or if the seed be planted the
[1:22:12] water will raise it up again he said
[1:22:14] amen then i got a great big hallelujah
[1:22:16] here is the secret the word is in the
[1:22:18] bride and the mind of christ amen to
[1:22:21] know what he wants done with the word
[1:22:23] remember the word is the sheet music the
[1:22:25] word is in the bride she plays by ear
[1:22:28] hallelujah because she's got the the
[1:22:31] word in her it's not just on paper
[1:22:33] anymore but it's become flesh
[1:22:36] and she does it in his name she has thus
[1:22:38] saith the lord what is it she's a help
[1:22:40] suitable to him she is his harmony part
[1:22:43] so now he hears on the earth again a
[1:22:45] people at the end time that can sing a
[1:22:48] complimentary part to the word
[1:22:51] thank the lord right
[1:22:53] amen now when brother branham was out
[1:22:56] west you remember the tape boys leo and
[1:22:58] jean had started a church and the random
[1:23:00] said this about that church
[1:23:02] he said but what a greater thing talks
[1:23:04] about making tapes he said what a
[1:23:05] greater thing god has did for them to
[1:23:08] make tapes he said most anybody can make
[1:23:10] a tape that's got the intelligence to
[1:23:11] turn on a tape recorder or can sell
[1:23:14] but it takes guidance of the holy spirit
[1:23:15] to guide a little group together like
[1:23:17] this this morning and keep them together
[1:23:19] in harmony and unity and still clinging
[1:23:21] to the message now that experiment that
[1:23:24] they had there failed it wasn't based on
[1:23:26] with good leadership they didn't stay
[1:23:27] with that leadership but we've seen that
[1:23:29] replicated all over the world in message
[1:23:31] churches that where people that where it
[1:23:34] was replicated god would provide a gift
[1:23:36] that would keep them together in harmony
[1:23:38] and unity and brother branham said it
[1:23:39] was took a greater gift to be able to do
[1:23:41] that it takes guidance of the holy
[1:23:43] spirit than just to make it take now
[1:23:45] again brother branham said this about
[1:23:47] the church being together he said notice
[1:23:48] if every person in here was in perfect
[1:23:51] harmony perfectly harmony with the holy
[1:23:53] spirit every one of you was filled with
[1:23:55] the holy ghost and in harmony with the
[1:23:56] holy ghost these signs would be just
[1:23:58] multiplying among you all the time it'd
[1:24:00] just be constantly going yeah
[1:24:05] but where there's confusion
[1:24:08] where there's difference
[1:24:10] and where we set up
[1:24:12] in other words we say this one this is
[1:24:14] what he's gifted to do but wait yeah
[1:24:16] right he said let let the preacher wait
[1:24:19] on his his ministry
[1:24:21] right let the let the uh prophesy wait
[1:24:24] on his prophet saying what's he saying
[1:24:26] let's see what god does
[1:24:29] and then let the officers be filled by
[1:24:31] those who can do it
[1:24:34] does that make sense
[1:24:36] but when there's confusion where there's
[1:24:37] difference where we set it up the holy
[1:24:39] spirit can't move itself you see it
[1:24:41] can't operate through the people that's
[1:24:43] what he wants to do isn't it yes again
[1:24:45] he said now the whole church would work
[1:24:47] in harmony like that then among us we'd
[1:24:49] be casting out devils taking up serpents
[1:24:51] drinking deadly things all kinds of
[1:24:53] things going on but when you try to
[1:24:54] force that to individuals he said you
[1:24:57] get yourself that's pentecostal again
[1:24:59] you get babylon confusion you can't
[1:25:01] judge that
[1:25:02] right because you forced it on
[1:25:04] individuals now
[1:25:05] how do we have this harmony today
[1:25:08] notice are you still with me tonight
[1:25:10] i'll just be a few more minutes
[1:25:13] when the music changes
[1:25:15] god in in morphe as brother brown said
[1:25:18] he changes his mask
[1:25:20] you've heard him preaching in the
[1:25:21] unveiling of god
[1:25:22] and mighty god unveiled before us
[1:25:25] notice the musicians at that point
[1:25:27] change what they're playing
[1:25:29] right god is changing his mask the
[1:25:31] director is changing his actions the
[1:25:33] conductor is changing what he's doing
[1:25:36] and so the musicians change
[1:25:38] with the conductor
[1:25:41] right if you had the musicians going on
[1:25:43] and replaying the same set of music
[1:25:45] you'd have a problem
[1:25:47] but when the conductor changes
[1:25:49] you ever seen them up there that have a
[1:25:50] bit of cheat music and they'll flip the
[1:25:52] page
[1:25:53] guess what happens everybody else flips
[1:25:54] the page
[1:25:56] right because they're moving on to the
[1:25:58] next act the next movement
[1:26:01] oh god and the bible says that we all
[1:26:03] with open face beholding is in a glass
[1:26:05] the glory of the lord are changed into
[1:26:07] the same image from glory to glory
[1:26:10] from one movement to another even as by
[1:26:13] the spirit of the lord but the brown
[1:26:14] said the same one that come down on the
[1:26:16] day of pentecost it's the same holy
[1:26:17] ghost that's manifested today from glory
[1:26:20] to glory to glory and it's back to its
[1:26:23] original seed oh that's powerful with
[1:26:26] the baptism of the holy ghost with the
[1:26:27] same signs same wonders same baptism
[1:26:30] same kind of people acting the same way
[1:26:32] with the same power the same sensation
[1:26:34] i'm going to fight for that i don't know
[1:26:35] about you but i'm going to fight for a
[1:26:37] church that has that same glory in it
[1:26:39] because that's the glory that it changed
[1:26:41] to on the day of pentecost
[1:26:44] right he said it's from glory to glory
[1:26:46] and the next will be changed from this
[1:26:47] glory the next will be
[1:26:50] now notice the next change
[1:26:53] in this glory we have prophets and
[1:26:54] apostles and evangelists and pastors and
[1:26:56] teachers in this glory we have uh we
[1:26:59] have the gifts of the spirit
[1:27:01] this is his mask god in his church
[1:27:04] you understand that's this glory
[1:27:06] that's what we have
[1:27:08] it don't change
[1:27:10] until the conductor changes it
[1:27:13] the church doesn't change its form until
[1:27:16] the conductor changes his mask
[1:27:20] but we had a prophet to come tell us to
[1:27:22] reveal him in the son of man ministry
[1:27:24] again so that we we could see he's
[1:27:26] fixing to change his mask but he said
[1:27:28] the next thing
[1:27:29] the next will be the next glory is
[1:27:31] change from this glory into a body amen
[1:27:34] aren't you looking forward to that day
[1:27:36] that'll be a body that never gets tired
[1:27:38] never sweats never never gets hot amen
[1:27:41] glory like unto his glorious body he
[1:27:44] said with the same now he said it's
[1:27:46] changed from his glory no body like his
[1:27:47] own glorious body where we shall see him
[1:27:49] he said abraham saw the same he said
[1:27:52] notice we see how it was changed since
[1:27:54] calvary we are invited to share his
[1:27:56] glory
[1:27:57] that's the glory we're in now by the way
[1:28:00] till these bodies are changed
[1:28:02] since calvary we're invited to share
[1:28:04] this glory his glory now in first
[1:28:06] corinthians 12 we're baptized into his
[1:28:07] body by one spirit we're all baptized
[1:28:09] not by one water one spirit we're all
[1:28:11] baptized that's right he said and then
[1:28:12] we become part of him but it's just like
[1:28:15] a great symphony that's playing out or
[1:28:17] acting out a drama he said i don't know
[1:28:18] too much about symphonies or drama but i
[1:28:20] was watching this play talking about
[1:28:22] carmen and my daughter and then was in
[1:28:23] it they were playing in this symphony
[1:28:25] and carmen that was acting out the music
[1:28:27] was acting out the same thing he said
[1:28:28] that's the way it is when you're
[1:28:30] baptized by the holy spirit into christ
[1:28:32] you're acting out the same thing as god
[1:28:34] changes his mask so do you yes
[1:28:38] sir oh god
[1:28:40] so that's the glory that we're in is the
[1:28:42] glory of god in his church now
[1:28:44] he said that's the way it is when you're
[1:28:46] baptized by the holy spirit into christ
[1:28:48] he said now see many of you has read or
[1:28:49] heard the story of the great russian
[1:28:51] composer composed peter and the wolf how
[1:28:52] that they act that out on symbols and
[1:28:54] everything
[1:28:55] anyone who knows the story that's
[1:28:56] reading off a paper can hear that
[1:28:57] symphony how it's acting that out the
[1:28:59] drama playing it out why they know every
[1:29:01] change they can look at it here and see
[1:29:02] the change he said but now what happens
[1:29:04] if the composer writes something we find
[1:29:07] out that it isn't just acted out right
[1:29:09] we find out then that there's something
[1:29:10] that happens there's something lacking
[1:29:14] right
[1:29:15] the harmonies aren't coming together
[1:29:17] why because somebody didn't play their
[1:29:19] part or the conductor got out of the
[1:29:21] spirit of the composer
[1:29:23] he said there's something lacking when
[1:29:24] we see them he who composed it has made
[1:29:26] it up and wrote it out and then the
[1:29:28] symphony is of playing it he said it's a
[1:29:30] wrong note
[1:29:31] he said there's something wrong the
[1:29:33] director gave the wrong motion see
[1:29:35] he said and that's what's the matter
[1:29:36] today my lutheran brother and my baptist
[1:29:39] brother my pentecostal brother and all
[1:29:40] my brethren from all different
[1:29:41] denominations that's what it is you're
[1:29:43] trying to give a note that hit back in
[1:29:44] the days of luther wesley like that when
[1:29:46] the actual the sheep music here shows
[1:29:48] that it's another day
[1:29:50] we can't live in the light of luther he
[1:29:52] was a reformer we appreciate his part
[1:29:54] but we played that out we're way over
[1:29:56] here at the back of the book now see we
[1:29:58] can't play it out like that he said now
[1:30:00] the only way that you're ever going to
[1:30:01] be able to do it my brethren is this are
[1:30:03] you listening
[1:30:05] he said and brethren of the world the
[1:30:06] different parts of the world i might say
[1:30:07] there's only one way for the director to
[1:30:09] do
[1:30:12] when your life gets discordant when your
[1:30:13] family life gets discordant when the
[1:30:15] church life gets discorded there's only
[1:30:17] one way if you're responsible for
[1:30:19] something whether it's your life or for
[1:30:20] your family or for a church there's only
[1:30:22] one way for the director to do he has to
[1:30:24] get in the same spirit that the composer
[1:30:26] was in
[1:30:28] then he's got it
[1:30:30] and when the church the symphony itself
[1:30:32] or the world is watching for these signs
[1:30:34] and wonders when the church and the
[1:30:35] composer and the director all get in the
[1:30:37] spirit of the composer then when they
[1:30:40] say the days of miracles is passed it
[1:30:41] don't hit the right note
[1:30:43] he said but when it gets in the right
[1:30:44] swing of it and the right spirit of it
[1:30:47] how are you going to do it until the
[1:30:48] spirit comes down with the composer
[1:30:50] and when you say the days of miracles
[1:30:52] never pass the symphony cries out amen
[1:30:57] now you're the symphony when we hit and
[1:30:59] say jesus christ is the same yesterday
[1:31:01] today and forever the symphony cries out
[1:31:06] you understand the symphony is in
[1:31:07] harmony hallelujah
[1:31:09] the whole symphony is right in harmony
[1:31:11] with the word brother brown said there's
[1:31:12] no more guesswork you shall receive
[1:31:14] power after the holy ghost has come upon
[1:31:16] you the symphony cries out
[1:31:18] i got it amen there's no more guesswork
[1:31:21] about it then the whole symphony is
[1:31:23] right in harmony with the word he said
[1:31:24] it's going clap his hands together
[1:31:27] probably in better time than that he
[1:31:29] said that's it oh it's a magnificent
[1:31:31] thing the director and the composer must
[1:31:33] be in the same spirit and so must the
[1:31:35] musicians be in the same spirit to act
[1:31:37] it all out and the world is wondering
[1:31:39] what's going on he said let's get back
[1:31:41] and get the symphony playing right where
[1:31:43] they of the world can see amen where
[1:31:45] they of the world can see where the
[1:31:47] people at school know and the people at
[1:31:49] church now and the people in the
[1:31:51] community know this person is in the
[1:31:53] spirit of the composers
[1:31:58] oh god they can tell
[1:32:00] they know
[1:32:01] i was so proud of esther the other night
[1:32:03] when her friends came and and peter some
[1:32:05] of peters weren't able to come but but
[1:32:07] her friends came to the her birthday
[1:32:09] party from school just girls from school
[1:32:12] they're not necessarily someone go to
[1:32:14] church some don't
[1:32:15] and they come from school and and i ask
[1:32:18] them i said what's esther like at school
[1:32:20] and they said oh she never gets in
[1:32:22] trouble
[1:32:25] embarrass esther she never gets in
[1:32:26] trouble saying man
[1:32:29] well it's taken a lot of years to get to
[1:32:30] that point but
[1:32:32] esther's always been a pretty good girl
[1:32:33] but you know you have to work with your
[1:32:35] kids and
[1:32:36] but it never gets in trouble and they
[1:32:38] said but this this this helped me more
[1:32:41] that one girl told me she said she's the
[1:32:43] best friend i've ever had
[1:32:46] but you know what the holy ghost can
[1:32:47] make you a good friend
[1:32:50] when you're in the spirit of the
[1:32:51] composer it makes you a good friend
[1:32:54] makes you a good husband makes you a
[1:32:56] good wife well you're in the good spirit
[1:32:57] of the composer makes you a good deacon
[1:33:00] makes you a good pastor
[1:33:02] are you with me now you're in the spirit
[1:33:04] of the composer
[1:33:05] you may not have all the abilities in
[1:33:07] yourself but you're in the spirit of the
[1:33:09] composer
[1:33:10] and i'd much rather have a musician
[1:33:12] who's in tune and then with the spirit
[1:33:15] who can play with the other instruments
[1:33:16] than one who gets everything right
[1:33:19] you understand the one who can get in
[1:33:20] tune with what's going on is more
[1:33:22] valuable than one who's technically
[1:33:24] correct in everything
[1:33:25] and that's the way it is we could we
[1:33:27] could know all the word we could be able
[1:33:28] to quote it frontwards and backwards but
[1:33:30] are you in the spirit of it
[1:33:32] can you work with other people on it are
[1:33:35] you a good friend
[1:33:37] are you a good
[1:33:39] are you a good
[1:33:40] christian
[1:33:43] amen
[1:33:44] brother branham said let the directors
[1:33:46] get in the right spirit
[1:33:48] with the musicians and with the composer
[1:33:50] everything will be all right do you
[1:33:51] believe that tonight
[1:33:53] closing in just a moment he said there
[1:33:55] were no guesswork about it
[1:33:57] he said we are identified with him
[1:33:59] then what part are we acting out today
[1:34:02] where are we at what's the what's the
[1:34:05] music show
[1:34:06] we could read revelation 10 1 where we
[1:34:09] see a mighty angel come down from heaven
[1:34:10] cold with the cloud and rainbow was on
[1:34:12] his head his feet was as it were the sun
[1:34:14] his feet as pillars of fire we read that
[1:34:16] and we begin to look at it that's
[1:34:17] already been played
[1:34:20] right that part's already been played
[1:34:22] yeah
[1:34:23] so where am i at revelation 10 7 in the
[1:34:25] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[1:34:27] when he should begin to sound the
[1:34:28] mystery of god should be finished and
[1:34:30] see if declared to his servants the
[1:34:31] prophets that's good that's a good part
[1:34:34] aren't you glad for that part
[1:34:35] that's already been played
[1:34:39] right brother branham taught us that in
[1:34:41] in
[1:34:42] uh in the sermon is this a sign of the
[1:34:44] end sir and then he he comes back around
[1:34:47] when he comes back around preach what is
[1:34:48] the attraction on the mountain he said
[1:34:50] what was prophecy is history
[1:34:53] he said three years ago these things
[1:34:54] were prophecy now they're history
[1:34:57] so now
[1:34:58] these things revelation 10 1 revelation
[1:35:00] 10 7 already fulfilled but look at the
[1:35:02] next verse
[1:35:03] and the voice which i heard from heaven
[1:35:05] speaking to me again the conductor
[1:35:08] are you with me now
[1:35:10] speaking to me again said go take the
[1:35:11] little book
[1:35:13] which is open
[1:35:14] it's open it's an open book aren't you
[1:35:17] glad for that today
[1:35:18] take the little book which is open
[1:35:20] and we're in the hand of the angel which
[1:35:23] stands upon the sea and upon the earth
[1:35:25] and i went up to the angel and said to
[1:35:27] him give me the little book
[1:35:29] and he said unto me take it and eat it
[1:35:30] up and it shall make that belly bitter
[1:35:32] but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as
[1:35:34] honey and i took the little book out of
[1:35:35] the angel's hand and ate it up it was in
[1:35:37] my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as i
[1:35:39] had eaten my belly was bitter why he was
[1:35:41] in harmony with what the angel said he
[1:35:43] was in harmony with the word
[1:35:45] and he said unto me thou must prophesy
[1:35:48] again what is yet to take place in your
[1:35:51] life you've got to keep speaking
[1:35:54] you're this is the part we're playing
[1:35:56] now the bride being the final voice to
[1:35:58] the final age and when you do that in
[1:36:00] harmony with the word the father looks
[1:36:02] down he said it's pleasing yes
[1:36:05] amen you see that revelation 10 1
[1:36:07] revelation 10 7 that was the opening of
[1:36:10] the word but revelation 10 8-9 and great
[1:36:13] through 11 is the opening of the word in
[1:36:15] flesh
[1:36:17] you understand that tonight that's where
[1:36:19] we're at
[1:36:20] the word has been opened
[1:36:22] now he wants you to be opened yes
[1:36:25] he wants you to be a living epistle red
[1:36:27] of all men
[1:36:28] that's what the composer wrote for this
[1:36:30] hour i say lord help me to live it

[1:36:34] we close tonight help me to be musicians
