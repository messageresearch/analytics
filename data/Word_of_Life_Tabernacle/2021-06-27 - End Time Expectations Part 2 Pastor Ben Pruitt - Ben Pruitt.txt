of that today we don't even know how to talk about it without tears lord running down our face and lord it just means so much to us to know what you did for us what you're doing for us lord you allow us to come together lord an atmosphere like this lord to be washed by the water of the word all the filth of all the ages of wrong teachings and things would be washed away from us all the wrong-headedness that we had ourselves all the sin lord we're so thankful for that today lord oh god would you just cover us by your blood this morning lord if there's one here that would need the lord just come closer to you i i pray god that they would take this opportunity there may never be another opportunity lord i pray for those that lord have a sickness or a need lord maybe a need lord in their mind or their heart and their spirit lord would you just meet that need this morning while the word is going forth would you take me out of the way lord and speak directly to your people this morning we pray thank you for all you do in jesus name amen amen do you love him this morning i want to read from matthew 24 we'll begin with verse 37 matthew 24 37 but as the days of noah were so shall also the coming of the son of man be as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking marrying and giving in marriage until the day that noah entered into the ark and knew not until the flood came and took them all away so shall also the coming of the son of man be then shall two be in the field the one should be taken and the other left two women should be grinding at the mill the one should be taken and the other left watch therefore for you know not what hour your lord doth come i pray the lord without his blessings to the word you may be seated this morning we preached a couple of weeks ago several weeks ago actually on end time expectations and i want to pick that up again this morning what should we expect at the end time between now and the end knowing the things that we know and the things that have come to pass and the uh the prophet that has came and the opening of the word and all of those things what should we now expect what should we be looking for at the time of the end we found out last time that we should expect to be awake while others sleep and the important thing here is that jesus constantly reinforces to his disciples is watch watch and pray watch be be awake be ready don't be sleeping don't don't be groggy don't be overtaken by the cares of the world and and just the things of life but be ready when that moment comes you want to be ready when that time comes you you want to have your your spiritual eyesight wide open because it'll come at a time when you think not it it'll you won't know what hour the lord will come and and so i want to dig into that a little bit this morning and jesus is speaking to his disciples and he's saying as the days of noah were and he's reading the same bible that we read he's reading from genesis chapter 6. so i want us to take genesis chapter 6 this morning and look into it and see what should we expect the world to be like and we'll look at that kind of delay of foundation as we move through this this morning genesis chapter 6 if you'll open your bible genesis chapter 6 and verse 1 it says it came to pass when men begin to multiply on the face of the earth now just if you stop there for just a moment this is a great sign of the end time and many times what we're looking for as we've said before is not what is actually going to happen we're looking for certain things to happen that we've decided are going to happen before the end many of these things have already happened and this is one of them men began to multiply on the face of the earth brother branham said that is an absolutely flashing light that the day is at hand he said the very first word presents us with absolutely flashing light that the day is at hand and there's never been a time in all the history that there's ever been so many people and so quickly multiplying as we have today and listen he takes it down to something that seems like a minor thing but you see it all the time he says until it's hard to get a place to stay he says a great sign of the end time will be that it's hard to get a place to stay it'll be difficult to get a room now look why because the population will increase and you see that every time you you try to go on vacation and you take a trip and you see that it's all booked up it's a sign of the end time because this is what was happening during the days of noah the world was increasing in population and so brother branham says that the days at hand there's never been a time in all the history there's ever been so many people now think about this for just a moment if you look at a graph of history you look at how history has the population has went it went like this for thousands of years and then it went up in the last hundred years it's went straight up and between the time brother branham said this in 1963 and today the population of the world has doubled doubled that's billions and billions more people are you with me this morning billions and billions more people you said brother ben i was looking for this to happen or that to happen but this is what jesus said would happen as the days of noah were men began to multiply on the face of the earth so all those people on the face of the earth men multiplying let's continue to read it says and daughters were born unto them genesis 6 1 daughters were born unto them verse 2 that the sons of god saw the daughters of men that they were fair now have you noticed brother branham says the increase of beauty of women in this day all the sisters said amen but you know he's talking about the increase of beauty now he's not talking about specific people being more beautiful because there's always been some people that are born with different kinds of looks and what the world would call beautiful but that is it's not that as much as it is the average person being able to make themselves beautiful being able to beautify themselves in such a way that the prettiest woman brother brown said when he was a young man that the prettiest woman was pearl o'brien he said there isn't a teenage girl in this school but would outshadow her when it comes to beauty and we see that today that that's went up and up and you look at the girls even from the 60s and then look at today and what's going on but it's they perfected the ability you might see it this way they perfected the art of putting on a mask putting on makeup but putting on putting on clothes that will enable them to attract the attention of a man and we could we could stop here and we could preach all day about this but i won't do that you know you you have the holy ghost if you don't have it you need to you need to be seeking for it because the holy ghost ought to be able to keep you in a place where your goal in the way that you're dressing the way that you're looking is not to attract the attention of the opposite sense right the holy ghost actually cares about that why because as it was in the days of noah this is what caused the increase of sin the increase of beauty the sons of god saw the daughters of men that they were fair they had learned how to beautify themselves how to act how to wear a maybe a dress that would come just above the knee and and a shirt that would be tight and and put the paint on their face just to be able to attract a man just enough they learned how to do that and they've learned how to do that today until it's gotten so bad that now it just it's become that people have become bored with just the norm and they actually go into perversion and everything else when did the now but brother branham doesn't leave this in the natural realm he takes us into the spiritual realm he says the increase of the beauty of women is showing the time of deception deception because they really don't look like that i thank god for godly sisters that don't do that but they really don't look like that what has caused the increase of that when and brother brown says when did the church look any prettier than it does today you better keep your eyes open be watching because the gospel is simple it's pretty basic right and god didn't bring you something that would be intellectual and something you'd have to figure out but the gospel is fairly basic even a fool the bible says will not err therein but satan's the beauty of satan's church is so great today that it'll be a very deceptive age that you don't know what that church looks like without makeup are you with me now you don't know what it looks like without all the the denominational trappings you don't know what it looks like what does it produce now look it could be a great church beautiful but it's just like a woman if you marry a young lady she may be beautiful but what what kind of offspring is she going to produce if she's wild she'll produce wild offspring what does the the results look like what do the children look like of this of this deception the children it's not pentecostal children it's not children that that that have the power of god and believe in the miracles of god and trust in god but it's children of the world who live any way they want to and and continue to increase in numbers but doing whatever that they want to do and saying god blesses me anyway i've got to preach these things i've got to go through this you just hang with me what causes the increase of the beauty of the modern church artificial enhancement you realize you can take the word of god and dress it up and make it more beautiful and make an error out of it make something false out of it that actually makes more sense oh you say well it makes more sense if we say that they went across on a sea of reeds across the red sea but it'd be kind of hard for the for the soldiers to drown john all the chairs but it makes more sense it does it makes more sense to say that jesus didn't really raise from the dead it makes more sense to say that signs and miracles and wonders ceased with the apostles it makes more sense sure it does because you're talking about supernatural things and supernatural things never make sense to the carnal mind you're telling me that god came down wrapped himself down in flesh and walked him among the men of the earth for for three and a half years and then was killed on a roman cross and nobody accepted him nobody recognized him that god would allow himself to be spit on and humiliated and and stripes put on his back you're telling me that god would allow that to happen to his own son he would allow that to happen to that flesh that was god it wrapped in flesh yes not because it makes sense but because god interpreted his word by bringing it to pass god did it right but be careful of systems of the world that deceive you by appearing to make more sense even the message doctrines well we'll spiritualize everything it makes more sense what else should we expect we should expect immorality to increase genesis 6 2 again says they took them wives of all which they chose wives of all which they chose and the original that wives is is women they took women and the flashing red light brother branham says did you notice it never said nothing about marriage he said the sons of god came into the daughters of men nothing about marriage if you're taking the original greek the word meaning it says he said i've got it wrote down here somewhere a wife taken unto them women not wives and i'm you can go back and get these quotes i'm kind of rushing through this and picking and choosing because there's somewhere i want to go this morning but he said they took them as they were free lovers like we have today in other words there were they were lovers in that day just as they are now they went any way they wanted to and took any woman that they could and god said my spirit will not always strive with man for that he also is flesh genesis 6 4 6 3 rather also his flesh yet his days shall be 120 years verse 4 we should also expect and we've seen immorality increase have we not expect scandal to become common among great men especially political leaders look at genesis 6 4 there were giants in the earth in those days also after that when the sons of god came in unto the daughters of men and bear children to them the same became mighty men which were of old men of renown renowned men everybody would know famous men the bible said he said these those men who taken to them women for wives were men of old renowned renowned men predicted to come again he said like it was in the days of noah so will it be in the coming of the son of man now men taking women not wise women going after strange flesh he said look in england a couple weeks ago look in the united states look everywhere it's full of prostitution great men great high offices bringing disgrace upon the nation running after women and brother branham it wasn't even known back there what john kennedy was up to but history bears it out and look ever since then kennedy clinton trump and now biden and harrison now it's gotten worse not even an issue in the campaign anymore if a person is going to run it's not even an issue whether there was scandal or not because we just expect it it's a sign of the end time genesis 6 5 and god saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination listen to this every imagination of the thoughts of his heart people say follow your heart you better not do what you think is right do do what your mind tells you to you better not because every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually continually it was evil why why was it oh god because the heart was falling away from god that the seed had been mixed and their heart fell before god oh god if you just realize today that our heart i don't care how long you've been in a message church how long you set on these views or maybe not these chairs for very long but you sat here for a while you've been in a message church it doesn't matter you may be you may have listened to every good preacher that ever goes down the pike you may do all kinds of things but your heart can be deceitful your heart can be wicked the imagination of the thoughts of his heart a man's heart that's the condition of man until he's renovated born again there's got to come a fire from god i hope you're hearing me today whether it's me or you or anybody else there's got to come a renovation you're not going to have a new you're not going to have a people that have been living in sin and everything just brought into a heaven that's pure brought into a new heavens and a new earth that's pure but as the earth is renovated by fire the people of god have to be renovated by fire we've got to be renovated by fire it takes the fire of god to burn out all out of you nothing else will work well i think we ought to have the fire of god don't you that's more than emotion that's the burning of the holy spirit burning through your conscience and your thinking and your your motives and your ambitions and everything else until you've given away given up everything the lord if you want me to never do that again i'll never do that again whatever it is you get you're willing to give up everything to have him he burns it all up now look what else was going on during that day something else was going on in the days of noah look at hebrews 11 5 it says by faith enoch was translated wait a minute that he should not see death and was not found now the days of noah was that time before the anadoluvian destruction something was going on during those days and it says he was translated that he should not see death and was not found because god had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony he pleased god during this time when every imagination of the thoughts of man's heart was only evil continually here was a man amen who walked with god during this time and please god now remember he was he could only do that because he was the seed of adam you know that he could only do that but the seed of adam every one of us god every one of us have gotten mixed up every one of us see we've got to be born again to please god we've got to be there's got to be a pure seed to be able to do that because no one else can do it but even enoch didn't always walk with god because the bible tells us that for the first 65 years that enoch lived doesn't say nothing about walking with god but when his son methuselah was born he began to walk with god you can begin to walk with god just because you haven't done it doesn't mean you can't do it now you can walk with god i can walk with god from today we can walk with god we can please god you say well i just can't live to please god yes you can you can do that you have the ability to please god you have to why because there's a new there's a seed on the inside there's something there that's not of corruptible seed you've been born again amen and the seed of god that was always there has been renewed and made new and it's and it's awakened and it begins to have control and authority over your life the inner man takes precedence over the outer men we can please god as a church no we'll never be perfect yes we'll always make mistakes in the flesh but we can please god we can walk with god in the days of noah at the end time when everybody's expecting these things to come on the earth and they do expect to see somebody who pleases god in a moment of of terrible sin and debauchery of the world expect somebody why don't you expect it to be you today we expect to fail we expect to do wrong we expect to do that why don't we expect to please god why don't we expect to have a family that'll love god with all of their heart why don't we expect to have a church that could be on fire for god why don't we expect to have a people to be a people that would be the manifestation of god to the world that we live in why don't we expect something like that hey man you're looking for something to happen over here something to happen over here but expect to see a people who are walking with god at the end time hallelujah i want to be one of those don't you expect to see a bride who will be the same as that first church was expect to see a people who had been restored back to the faith of the original pentecostal fathers hallelujah amen again it doesn't mean that you haven't ever made a mistake people make mistakes but expect to see somebody who walks with god let's look at matthew 24 again matthew 24 40 then shall two be in the field one should be taken and the other left listen two women should be grinding at the mill one should be taken on the other left he said watch therefore for you know not what hour your lord doth come two women two men and two women both continuing their daily activities of farm life now notice jesus portrays these people as being at work not at church right because he's emphasizing you know not right so he's emphasizing bringing home the point that you're not just a christian at church or on sundays but every day of your life you can't live you can't please god anymore then you live peaceably with your family you can't do it you can't you can't worship god any stronger than you live at home and that doesn't mean you have to be bound by your mistakes all the time everybody makes mistakes but you repent of those things and you move forward walk forward you don't have to look back at all you can walk forward christians have the ability to do that but you you don't have to live you can't live you can't jump any higher than you live right now look he says they're both continuing their daily activities that we could put it like this because that was an agricultural age today we have different occupations but the same idea you could say brother allen you say two will be at the bank huh one morning you have an appointment it says eight o'clock somebody walks in there and sits down brother allen gets up to go get the copies because for some reason they never put the copy machine in the office in a bank i don't know why but he'll go get i don't know if his copy machine's in his office or not he may have one but they go to get the copies get up walk down the aisle to get the copies and he never comes back guy sits there and says well this is the worst service i've been a customer of this bank for 40 years two will be at the bank one taken another left see well i don't fit with my theology well it did with the lord's think about it two will be painting a house two will be working on the construction site and the one yells over hey i need that bucket of paint bring up that bucket of paint no answer the guy quit where'd he go he's gone two women sitting talking maybe i shouldn't just have them sitting and talking but two women doing whatever it is that they do maybe at work maybe at home and they're taking care of their children gone one taken another left look he says in luke 17 34 he says it again he said i tell you and that night there shall be two men in one bed the one should be taken the other should be left two women should be grinding together the one should be taken and the other left you say well this this and this has to happen we'll get into that but this this has to happen well how would that be secret because listen if anybody sees me turn back into a perfect body they're gonna know it think about it it's a sudden secret going away of the church and they won't even know what happened maybe a few will guess at it because they were exposed to the message and they said under message preaching luke 17 34 he said i tell you that night there should be two men in one bed one should be taken to other left two women should be grinding together the one should be taken the other left two men shall be in the field the one should be taken and the other left and they answered and said unto him where lord where are they going amen i love this he said wheresoever the body is neither will the eagles be gathered together see we're gathered to him now and this is going on right now in a spiritual sense you understand it's going on one's taken and the other's left but yet there's a there's a physical manifestation of that too because there's coming a time when there'll be people missing but right now one's taken and the other's left one has a desire a burning desire to please god and another one sits right beside him on the church view and has no desire one may look you say well it's the ones that live the best i beg to differ think about it who was the seed jacob or esau be the one that does everything right keeps all his bills spayed and is the perfect christian in hardy arkansas the perfect hearty definition of what a christian would be that's the one that's going to go don't don't think like that because that might just be somebody covering up you don't know what somebody is on the inside but you got to be ready yourself and so wherever the body is neither will the eagles be gathered together wherever the word is brother said that's that body was the carcass was the word of the hour the fresh kill of the hour the word of the hour not the word of another day but those that are gathered around amen what's it going to be now lots of people i'm going to go into some dangerous territory here but you just stay with me lots of people love shouting and emotion and and sensation and i do too but a lot of people like that a lot of people gather around that but that's not what he said they'd be gathered around but they'd be gathered by the word watch and see what what value people place on the word are they willing to do whatever it takes to get the word are they willing to do whatever it takes to have their families under the word to have their how have their there being a church that preaches and teaches the word watch people's reaction to the word and all of that is a part of the word the word said what happened the word said we'd shout and speak in tongues and and all these things the gifts of the spirit but watch your attitude towards the word that's what makes the difference wherever the body is neither will the eagles be gathered together now where the word is they will be gathered to that word of the hour and we know that that word is christ now again it won't be and we'll get into this a little more it won't be a particular place in the earth whenever a man tells you that he has the word and nobody else does run because we've already had the word given for the hour the word has come for the hour i've got truth that you need to make it run because jesus said there'll be many false christs false anointed ones there'll be many that'll say here here and here this is where you should go here in the desert here here over here he said no he said don't believe any of them the word has to be vindicated the word of the hour now look what brother branham says about these things in abraham and his seat after him in 1961 he said but the next thing for the church is to be changed if you go back and get the whole quote he's talking about how there was martin luther and john wesley and the church went through the process of justification sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost and seeing the manifestation of the promised son the sign of the son of man he said but the next thing for the church is to be changed he said we've had every sign justification sanctification baptism of the holy spirit placing of a son manifestation of the spirit now what he said the changing of the body for the rapture he said oh my how the church ought to be waving its hands in glory thanking god amen thanking god any minute the change could come now watch what he says for the bible said it'd be universal i don't get changed and then come up here on sunday morning and say see i got a new body now y'all if you all listen to me this morning you can have yours that's not how it works look there'd be no warning not now we've already had a warning the midnight cries already been made the shout has already went out now look he said to be universal jesus said there'll be two in the middle grinding i'll take one and leave one two in the field i'll take one and leave one two in the bed he said should it be on both sides of the earth now listen both sides of the earth well it's night on one side be day on the other i'll take one and leave one he said the rapture will be universal and their bodies will be changed our bodies he said will have to be changed we just can't turn back to young men and women we've got to have a different kind of body he said so you can be caught in the air to receive the promised son he said that's what the church is waiting for now so we don't get distracted by every little thing that runs off and and starts its own place in the desert right but but you got it what the true church is watching for is the change of the body he said well that's what they said 20 years ago it's as true today as it ever was and watch matthew 24 and 25 as jesus brings to come through these things what happens the the husbandmen the men begin to say that my lord delayeth is coming the virgins the foolish virgins and the wise virgins both falsely all these things that happen why because there's a delay there's a delay built in but we're we're not looking at the delay we're not looking at that time can be the enemy of faith many times you say well it's been years and years and years but i'm looking at the promise what's the next promise like abraham was he wasn't looking for something else he said there's going to be a son and he believed it for 25 years until it come to pass we've been believing it for longer than that but it's coming to pass it's got to now look you see and i know where message people were educated what about six and nine now think about this because brother brown says this in the rapture he said the night was not divided in hours and bible time was divided into watches there were three watches and the first watch started from 9 to 12. the second watch started from 12 to 3 and the third watch of the night was counted from three to six so now you're in the morning morning time right he said now we got three threes which is nine imperfect number he said then we come back to seven for the rapture he said which will take place i believe between six and seven o'clock he said or six and nine o'clock some morning for the trumpet of the lord shall sound and brother branham quotes a hymn when the role is called up yonder so on that bright and cloudless morning right it'd be morning now look but morning where i think it's important for us not to get too hung up that we got to balance our doctrine what we teach we make a dogma out of something brother branham said and we not balanced it with everything that he said many times and and look here because brother brown said and god keeps his word in 1957 he said two will be in the bed he said it must be night time somewhere when he comes now for me i want it to be between six and nine i'm expecting him some morning brother brown said that's what he believed between 6 and 9. come now but think about this jeffersonville time or is it jerusalem time i think about that jerusalem time be about 10 o'clock at night and i don't know about some of you but i'd be in bed most nights right we have no you understand we have no option on that like we don't get to tell god well you it's going to happen after i wake up right are you with me now but some morning we could say that some morning it'd be six and nine between six and nine somewhere maybe that'll be jeffersonville time i kind of think that maybe god showed brother branham that it'd be that time but it'd be that's five and ten here or five and eight my math doesn't work very good so you know if you if you're too dogmatic on something like that you miss what brother branham was trying to say some morning we're going to be changed now look at this he said two will be in the bed must be nighttime somewhere now look at the order of the rapture brother branham gives the ten virgins he says there will be some of you sitting at a table one of these mornings sitting at a table one will be taken the other left said brother ben are you sure about that i'm absolutely sure about it what it means is you don't go as a family you don't go as a group you don't go as a church you go as an individual he said you'll finally wonder what's the matter one will be taken the other left what's the matter he said be riding right along in a car talking to somebody wife or hubby now think about the how traumatic this would be wife or hubby oh my sitting at the seat they won't answer they won't be there run to the graveyard he said there'll be some graves open the other one's still closed you say explain that brother ben i can't explain that i don't know but he said it he said for the rest of the dead live not for the space of a thousand years he said just remember it's over then it'll be a secret coming no one will know when it's going to happen he said we're commanded to be ready and watching we don't know what hour but whatever it is amen will not prevent any of these back in here for just as soon as jesus appears the whole watch rises dead or alive doesn't matter bad see god's got a wanted poster he wants you dead or alive some will be dead some will be alive but it won't matter it's a universal rapture he said we don't meet him first we meet one another first amen the bible said ephesians the fifth chapter it said for we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord down here shall not prevent or hinder those which are asleep and he goes on and i've just taken part of this but you can go look at the whole thing he said them precious ones that sealed their blood sealed their testimony with their blood not prevent or hinder those that are asleep for the trumpet will sound something will take place the gospel something will sound the announcing of his coming and the dead in christ shall rise first and we which are alive and remain shall be changed he said standing and feel a change coming on the gray hair go out the wrinkles fall away be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye and we shall meet our loved ones first there's mama papa there's my buddy oh hallelujah we're ready amen and then together with them that we're dead sets of scripture we'll be caught up in the air to meet the lord the order of the coming amen now he said oh to see that old daddy of mine oh my see them old loved ones just went down in faith yonder to meet them see the sweetness of god knowing if we met him first we'd wonder was mama in it didn't mama finally make it we've preached so hard we've tried what's she here his uncle joe here is the brother here is so-and-so see lord we love you we love you but first we're going to meet one another oh no wondering about it we're all there now look first corinthians 15 51 look how paul puts it behold i show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trump and the trumpet shall sound the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed you say well i'll notice i'll notice my wife she's a good christian and she'll be real real really a christian right close to the rapture you're not going to know well i'll notice my church will be on fire i'll get ready i'm i'm a young person waiting you know i haven't been baptized or maybe maybe an older person than that's hiding something that they should should just let go of holding on to some grudge or something like that i'll just hold on to it because i'll know when the time comes for the rapture i'll see some things i'll see brother brown and i'll see this and that and the other you won't know it'll happen so quick it'll all go past you you won't know it'll just be gone brother branham keeps getting this question and questions and answers they keep asking him about the bride will they be in one place and these are leading questions many times because there was a doctrine then that that you had to go west to be in the message and we've heard a different version of that on some level over and over and over again through the years you have to go here to be in the message and what's funny about it is it was the desert and brother branham answers it by saying no jesus said don't go to the desert don't go to the desert even though that's where brother branham was but he said is he in the desert no and and so they keep asking this question will the bride be gathered together in one place at the rapture and will it be in the west i said brother branham come on and say it we know you believe it just because people just assumed that the prophet believed what they believed right sometimes we do the same thing he said no he said nope it don't have to be there yeah the bride will be gathered together in one place that is true but not until the resurrection he said see we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent or hinder those which are asleep universally for the trumpet of god shall sound and the dead in christ shall rise and we shall be caught up together with them to meet the lord in the air therefore he said the bride will all be together when it goes to meet the lord see it we'll be together but it don't necessarily mean they'll have to be sitting in one place like this because the bride is sleeping in the dust of the earth around the world from the arctic to the tropics from the east to the west from the north to the south so jesus said when the son of man shall appear why it said it'd be like light that shines from the east even into the west he said the whole thing there will be a resurrection a rapture and a way it'll go and before it ever he said go up to meet him now the first thing happens when we're resurrected he said the ones which are living will just still remain the resurrection will set in first the resurrection of those that are asleep there will be awakening time those which are asleep in the dust now not those that are asleep in sin because they sleep right on they don't awake for another thousand years but those who are sleeping in the dust will be awakened first and these corruptible bodies will put on incorruption in the rapture and grace of the lord then we'll all get together oh what a meeting and we're not going to hold off in our own little church and our own little doctrine and stay off on our side and we'll all get together we'll all get together because god's people love to be together show me one place in scripture where god's people ever ever chose to stay alone unless it was a prophet of god it was standing out into the desert you understand but god's people always wanted to be together he said and then when they begin to get together then we which are alive and remain shall be changed amen he said these mortal bodies will not see death but just of a sudden there'll be like a sweep go over us and you're changed you're turned back like abraham was from an old man to a young man from an old woman to a young woman what's this sudden change after a while you're traveling like a thought amen you can see those then who are already resurrected oh what an hour i'm looking forward to seeing some i'm looking forward to seeing them look if you want to go see if you've got somebody overseas if you've got a loved one or you've got people i've got people that i've met that i just fell in love with while i was overseas people they're wonderful godly christian people and i'd love to be back overseas i'd love to go see them i may never get to go see them but i know this it's a 16-hour plane ride and then another four-hour plane ride to get where they're at but one of these days all i have to do is think about them i'd like to see brother malevo or i'd like to see i'd like to see brother pastor benin be right there church you realize how big that is how much it is the the desire to gather together how much a part of a christian that is the desire to be together not to be alone because we're going to be together there's not going to be a heaven where it's all split up and separate we're going to be together amen amen we're gathered together he says then he said oh what an hour he says then we'll gather with them and then be caught up with them to meet the lord in the air he said it's not necessary if your uncle is buried down in southern kentucky if he has to be brought up in indiana or buried in indiana has to be taken to southern kentucky no matter where he is them that are dead in the sea shall rise from the sea he goes on and talks about it some he said those that were destroyed in that arena eat up by lions those who are thrown in the fiery furnaces not even the bones will be left or the dust they shall still rise amen he says they've died everywhere china japan around the world the coming of the lord will be universal this rapture will he said watch the changing there will be two in the pen i'll take one and leave one the same moment two in the field i'll take one and leave one one on the dark side of the earth one on the light side of the earth see it'll be a universal rapture yes the church will all be together but after after the resurrection and the rapture said and he said brother ben where are you going with this it's important church it's important because we've got to realize that we go as an individual to be in a group but we don't leave as a group don't splash over it's not like i'll go in the rapture because i'm set born again and then my my wife will go because she's next to me that's not how it works she has to be born again too so do every one of you myself preacher included we ought to give up everything to get that everything to get that look brother branham answers the same question that was questions answers number one question and answer is number four same question they've asked it four or five times in between and brother branham in one place says i'll tell you you want a place you can go i'll tell you where it is i'm gonna tell you the place that's in christ the question to answer is number four he said they asked him the same basically the same question he said it's very doubtful whether it'll be that way because the bible said there will be two in the bed he said i'll take one and leave one two in the field and i'll take one and leave one he said see so they probably across the world they won't be gathered in one place to have things in common now watch as he goes through this quote you can go read the quote he as he answers the question he gets more and more certain of what he's saying and says it more and more definitely he starts off he says probably won't be that way then he continues on watch what he says he said they won't be gathered in one place to have things in common but little groups of them will be scattered all over the earth now watch you've noticed that in the message over the years that every time there comes a gathering place where everybody's got to be and go whenever that happens people start to go and they say well i need to identify with a certain ministry this certain place in a certain town every time that happens something happens to break it up think about it preacher gets old and passes away or or some scandal something happens god allows something to take place and it breaks it up why why why is there not and i've seen even overseas and and it's worse overseas than it is here where a man will some man some gifted minister especially in africa will take control of a huge group of people everybody's got to come hear me and he's never even met half his congregation but brother brown didn't say it would be that way he said there will be little groups of them all over the all over the earth scattered all over the earth and i believe that's why they get broke up because god won't allow it little groups of them will be scattered over the earth i don't want to be identified with a certain ministry a certain certain place or a certain time i want to be in one of those little groups little maybe 500 maybe a thousand maybe maybe five i don't know what size that little group is but i want to be in it and then of that group that well not everybody goes you understand little groups everywhere and brother branham says i believe maybe if the lord permits that this is a little group of it he said maybe another little group in asia one down in germany one down somewhere else now watch what he says he said when i seen a vision of the bride the other night they was made up from the international remember they were wearing the clothes that of their country they were wearing or wearing the they had different they had different uh faces they had different features they had all the features and things that they would have of their own country that they come from they look like their own country but they were all gathered together now look that don't happen on this side happens on the other side but they come from every country he said they were made up from the international he said see so the bride won't be gathered from one place it'll be gathered from all over the world and it's been being gathered for all these years what is it being gathered to to christ the word but not everybody that comes to church is gathered to the word now look he said they'd be gathered from all over the world and that exactly vindicates with the word and never has the word been wrong he said unto this time neither has the vision ever been wrong because it's been according to the word now watch how he stressed i know i'm reading a lot this morning but i've just got a few more minutes then we'll close watch how he stresses this individual goes in the rapture not the church not the group he said his in christ the mystery of god revealed he fit his presence in the individual in the individual with a personal vindication of himself expressing himself the living word that's promised for the day expressing itself through you a vindication of the great revelation of god he said well brother branham was vindicated but brother branham said that we would be vindicated not in that way but it's vindicated by the life that we live right we are vindicated a vindication of himself he said look only in an individual never in a group an individual not in a group his identification is with an individual he said you get that not with the method it's not with the baptist not the presbyterian not the lutheran not the pentecostals but as an individual he said but if i'm with this certain group in the message i'll be okay knowing his identification is with the individual and i can walk with the best of them be around the best of them go to all the camp meetings and stuff that i enjoy doing i could go to all of them and still not make it because he said i'll take one and leave one i'll separate them that's right there'll be two in the field i'll take one and leave one there'll be two in the bed i'll take one and leave one it's not a group it's a it is a personal vindication listen of impregnated child of god filled with the holy ghost so surrendered to god that he don't care about anything else and the holy spirit living its life pulsating through him showing the personal vindication of the word he said brother ben what vindication do you want what vindication do you want do you want a pillar of fire do you want a great ministry you want a bunch of people to watch a bunch of people to stream what vindication do you want i want a personal vindication of the word a personal vindication of the word that'll show up where i work to show up where i live where i eat what i do everything about me it'll show who i am a personal vindication of the word itself it's expressing itself to the people into the world amen never said well we'll all go where the where the prophet is not even when the prophet was here we'll all go where the preacher is we'll all go where some great man is never did that look at this this quote just just struck me and then i'll close brandon preached a sermon called the sudden secret going away of the church that title attracted my attention as a young man the sudden secret going away of the church he said now you say certain things will take place and then i'll make ready make ready now he said well i gotta wait for the population to increase really it's doubled since brother branham said that and been going on for a long time make ready now oh i gotta wait for the world to get wicked really i'm waiting on a message to come really waiting on a prophet really i mean come on but i tell you what we'll fight we'll fight the everyday things of life because that's what jesus told us we'd fight we'll fight just going to work and getting discouraged being discouraged at home seeing our kids maybe do things and just getting discouraged well maybe don't matter getting caught up in the bills and the things that are going on and all the amusements that we have just getting caught up that's where we're going to fight every day we're going to fight there because we have to be ready make ready now he said i've just related to you pearl harbor in many places where they refuse to hear the warning they didn't hear it they refused to listen to it he said nothing was left but divine judgment upon the people he said now all that will not go in christ listen all that will not go in christ will be under god's wrath and divine judgment remember what i preached wednesday night he's not a destroyer he didn't come the first time to destroy that's not his nature but he will come in wrath and destroy those who destroy the earth he will come that's a reality we're promised that by the scripture regardless of how you think it'll happen we're promised that by the scripture he will come and wrath the lion the lamb becomes the lion and becomes judgment and all that will not going by judgment he said please don't let that happen to you i may spend the rest of my life for the job if it takes the rest of my life if it takes everything that i have not so much should warn you i want to warn you but myself let that ring in my ear please don't let that happen to you you say well that's you're a preacher but paul said lest i preach to others and be disapproved of myself i want to go in that rapture i've got a desire to go in the rapture i've heard preachers preach it as if well it don't really matter if i don't go to rapture i'll be a foolish virgin i don't want to be here i don't want to be here when the elements melt with fervent heat i don't want to be here i want to be ready i want to be wet ready to go listen what he says he said no matter what the branham tabernacle ever turns out to be don't you let it be you you don't identify as a group no matter what the church does god forbid that this church would ever become worldly and allow all kinds of everything to go on don't you let that be you some of the church would become crazy go off on some doctrine somewhere don't you let that be you you'll be a servant of christ no matter what the church world does you'd be a servant of christ he said it's not up to the branham tabernacle neither is it up to any other church he said it's up to you i take that personally brother joe i take that personally it's up to me as an individual oh god say brother ben have you always been ready no but i believe i'm ready now and i so badly want every day to be ready say oh my brother ben you're predestined i know the predestination will go but the predestination have a desire to put on the wedding dress that he gave her rebecca had a desire to water the camel she didn't even know why she had a desire to go with him she said yes i'll go he gave her the decision she said yes i'll go and i say yes i'll stay awake i'll be right with god if it takes me down in an ultra i'll do it if it takes me crying out before god at home i'll do it if it takes me giving up everything i'll do it because i want to be ready not because i'm afraid but because i i don't want to miss it because i want to be with him hell for me would be not to be with him i've said this before i don't stand before you as a perfect man far from it but you've got to get in your life to the point where the pain of the separation from god is worse to you than the thrill that you get from doing whatever you're doing you sit there and gossip about somebody but it separates you is it worth it that presence just goes to gable in your soul you're not lost but that presence just isn't there but there's something in the bride that wants to be in his presence he wants to be in his presence brother said it's up to you as an individual to be ready at the coming of the lord you must be ready i must be ready this is the way he puts this he says i'll sweep my own steps oh god i just had this visual brother brandon i'm cleaning his steps for the coming of the lord he's coming i'm getting ready you know how you get ready when somebody's coming to the house send peter out there with the blower and blow off the the back porch and the in the front yard the driveway why i want them to be comfortable i want to be able i want them to come in i don't think it's an abandoned house they might think that sometimes up to me to sweep my own steps every once in a while as a pastor i just have to get it has to be real enough to me sometimes so that i'll turn around and sweep my steps sweep out from behind the pulpit sweep the clutter out of my mind it's got to be that real to me that i'm willing to sweep my own steps but he said it's up to you to sweep your steps how long has it been since you swept your steps this is what he said said leave mine alone me leave yours alone you've got to make your garment ready how long has it been since you swept your steps how long has it been since you just really decided that this service this this prayer time this time i'm gonna i'm gonna make sure that i can connect with god listen we're living in a deceitful age i've had people sit and tell me but i thought i was okay because i still felt the presence of the lord in church i still could raise my hands i thought i was okay doing what i did because i could understand it intellectually and realize not realize that they're what they're doing is directly against the word but it's up to you as an individual to sweep your own steps i thought i was okay because i went to word of life tabernacle i thought i was okay because until you realize there will be people there on that day not everybody that heard brother branham eve went in there will be people that heard a prophet of god when he was alive on the earth that will not make it and they'll be in the tribulation period they'll be crying out saying i thought i was okay because i heard a prophet but i didn't preach my own i didn't sweep my own steps i know i'm not condemning you i'm one of you i'm a hearty i suck the rest of you whatever people want to call you i don't like it when people talk bad about people around here because there's some real people of god around here real jewels of god and yet i realize that you know you have different spirits in different areas we tend to sweep other people's steps i don't have to sweep the step at the church next door i can't even sweep yours all i can do is hand you a broom here you go sweep your own steps but say that to anybody listen sweep your own steps i'm not worried about getting somebody from i don't want to i don't want nobody from another church i don't want him any other sheep i want to reach somebody that that's lost that's somebody that's found sweep our own let's sweep our own steps well the other message people are doing this let's sweep our own steps get all the trash off of it all the dust and the dirt see how often do you have to do that well how often do you sleep at home you ever notice a room can have nobody in it you can shut it up with nobody in it you come back there's dust all over everything why there's dust in the air we're living in a time when there's dust in the air it'll get on you get all over you and and you get to where you believe in things and looking at things and doing things that you have no business doing sweep your steps let's bow together the musicians would come he said brother man nobody else preaches like this i don't there probably is other people that preach like this i don't know they don't have to god has different callings different ministries but i'll say this i have to do what god tells me to do and the other day in my office i'm sitting there reading that quote and god told me to sweep your steps i can't answer for you all i can do i got a broom if you want to borrow one sweep your steps say well this and this and this has to happen sweep your steps make sure you're ready because it'll be in a moment you think not one will be taking the other be left moment in the twinkling of an eye sweep your steps i think we need more of that oh god if there's anything in me could you make that your your prayer i don't want not just sinners but maybe you maybe you have struggle you've held on to something and it is destroying your life and you've held on to it why do you hold on to something why are you grabbing hold of it like a snake that gets wounded by a saw and it'll wrap himself around and it just keeps cutting deeper and deeper why hold on to it let it go sweep your steps you feel the urgency of the hour sweep your steps i don't if you want to come up here if you want to kneel where you're at if you want to stand if you want to sit there sweep your steps this morning maybe you have to have just a little broom maybe just a little whisk room you take out and just sweep your steps off because you kept them clean would you do that [Music] maybe some of us need a great big push broom to sweep our steps with all the clutter they are all the pastor don't love me the church don't love me nobody nobody cares about me the things of life the way things are
