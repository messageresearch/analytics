perfect way it has perfect we love you so much [Music] to Revelations five amen how many is happy to be in the house of the Lord amen amen I want to speak again on worship under Redemption and try to kind of look at what what Adam lost and that that we're going back to what he lost amen Revelations 5 9. and this this set of scriptures you know it it can cover a lot of things here and you know we're not going to get so much into that but but under under these scriptures I mean I believe it covers I believe it covers where we are amen Revelations 5 9. and they sung a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and has redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred and tongue and people and Nation and has made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign on the Earth and I beheld and heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders and a number of them was Ten Thousand Times Ten thousands and thousands thousands sing with a loud voice Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing and every creature which is in heaven and on Earth and under the Earth and such as are in the sea and all that them are in them heard I sang blessing and honor and glory and power be unto him that sitteth upon the throne and unto the lamb forever and ever you can be seated this morning amen we should be able to say Worthy is the Lamb that was slain this morning amen worthy Worthy is the Lamb that has redeemed us Amen to God by his own blood and what a blood that is amen amen and we can look here and what what a worship this was by John amen the lamb taking the book of redemption amen and our names were on that book amen and somebody had to come forth and to take that book amen if if if he hadn't came if the lamb hadn't came everything would be lost all creation everything would have been lost and everything in everything in heaven amen when they heard John praising everything in heaven and in Earth and under the Earth heard John Praise Him brother round said it must have been a real Pentecostal time amen a time of worship amen and we're living we're living under these scriptures our eyes have been open to the things that have happened in in this day and and what God is doing and and we're living under this type of worship amen My Touch screen's messed up on my computer so I'm just gonna have to hit the button like the old-fashioned way here amen so if if he wouldn't have came we would have been lost we would have all been lost right we needed a redeemer to come we needed someone a man to bring a blood to bring a sacrifice because because the law and we won't get into this a lot we wish we could we wish I had time but we understand that there was a law of redemption amen that God said in his word a law of redemption and that we needed a near Kinsmen the blood of sacrifice of bulls and ghosts that that which Abel brought even by Revelation wasn't enough wasn't enough to take us back to what to what we were before the fall to take us back to what Adam lost right because because as we as we ministered before amen Abel brought that sacrifice to the guard to the to the to the gate of the garden that was as far as he could come right it would only take him so far but yet under that sacrifice he would be brought back into Fellowship because God always provides a way for his people to have fellowship with him he provides a way to come back can I get this a little bit more volume my voice is going to give out I don't want to speak that but I need a I need a little bit But Here Come the lamb here come the lamb amen he brought forth a blood it wasn't the blood of Jews or Gentiles but it was a created blood it was the very blood of God Amen it was a creative blood and it was a blood strong enough Amen to to undo what Adam and Eve did to the rest of us right it was a blood strong enough to take us back it was a bleach blood as brother Branham describes in in the breach of uh and when he preached the breach amen it was a blood Amen to take us back amen our blood a Clorox bleach amen amen to abolish and to annihilate Amen to to cleanse completely amen amen our blood's so strong amen that it could bring forth back the children of God bring them back to their position amen amen so here we see these scriptures amen it was a time of worship it was when all the church agents were finished when the mysteries of the Plan of Redemption were finished Amen brother random said it was a time amen there where the seals were opened everything in Heaven and Earth worshiped this is what all creation had grown for this is what it had longed forced someone to come forth and to take the book someone that was worthy to take the book because if if he didn't all was lost we were lost everything would have just went off but because he had Sons and Daughters because God had a plan and God will he will ruin he will fool he has foiled Satan's plan he has disrupted amen Satan's plan that he had amen God Amen by Redemption amen under that law of redemption and by the blood is able to bring us back amen to what Adam lost amen everything worshiped everything worshiped and it was under this time that that worship took place and if we could just see amen that we're not living under just an ordinary Revival we're not living just uh just during a time of just an outpouring of the spirit and we'll get into that just in a little bit later I'll read you something that brother Brown said this isn't just an ordinary Revival that we're living under but we're living under the worship we're living under the worship of the Lamb that has come forth in this hour and that's that's that's the that's all that's what God has planned if I could get the word the words out this has been God's plan all along amen no matter what what we see what what what someone else does what someone else produces this is God's plan under this word of the hour under this Plan of Redemption and what he has showed us and what he has brought us under and this is what we worship under and Redemption this Redemption is bringing us back it's bringing us back to what Adam lost and brother Brown says here in the message the breach he says here but now in this Sevenfold book of seals of redemption that the lamb took within himself was the only one who could do it and he took it from the right hand of him that sat on the throne now to claim his Redemptive right to claim his rights he says to claim for me and you what he redeemed us from to see back to everything that Adam Lost In the Garden of Eden he has redeemed us back to them so we look at what what did Adam lose Adam lost his rights yes he lost his rights Adam was God of the earth amen he had all authority amen but he lost those rights he forfeited his right as a son of God amen but there has been Redemptive claims there's been Redemptive claims on you and I there's been a Redemptive act that has took place amen and Redemption the word Redemption is to bring back to bring back amen and to restore Amen to the former of what what it was right amen the bleach of blood has come forth in this hour and it has come forth amen and the understanding of it amen we've received that understanding amen amen and I say let it come forth this morning if there's something Among Us and there's something in our lives let that bleach come forth let it destroy any sin in my life in your life amen and in doing that it puts it back it puts it back on Satan that's what this blood does that's what the blood of Jesus Does to take away and break any hold that Satan would have upon us to take away the shame the shame that was brought on us amen by the fall and by these things that we didn't have no control over Amen to take away the shame amen and put Joy back in your life amen put Authority back in your life put an identification of who you are back in your life that we have a right amen we have an inheritance as the children of God and then we don't have to walk in shame we don't have to live in shame amen the blood takes every bit of that away it takes every bit of the fear it takes every bit of the unworthiness away for none of us could do it amen no man was worthy but one came forth that was Worthy amen I'm so thankful this morning amen so under Redemption we're going back to that which was lost amen amen Redemption means to bring back we're going back to to the original position that we had and gone and brother Brown talks about it like this he said you know he heard the story of the devil the devil put me in the pawn shop but Jesus got me out and that's what Redemption is that's what Redemption is amen the devil put me in there amen I I didn't have no control over what I was born and sin the devil put me in there amen but Jesus got me out amen he paid the price amen he thought enough of me to come by that old antique Place amen somebody may have walked by walked by me so many times and wrote me off said I wasn't worth nothing said you wasn't worth nothing but to Jesus amen you were worth his blood you were worth the stripes and the scars and everything that he took upon that tree of Calvary you were worth every bit of that to pay that price and he come by your way man amen and he took you out of the pawn shop he took you out of the prison he took you out of the prison of this life amen and brought you to a freedom as a son and daughter of God amen he paid the price that price of redemption and we were worshiping under that Redemptive Act we're not worshiping under a theology or or just a just an emotion just an emotion or something that we can muster up and then we're worshiping amen we're identifying ourselves with that sacrifice just as Abel about Revelation he came amen he he didn't have nothing to read he didn't he didn't have the material that you and I had but by Revelation and he died he identified himself and he died on the altar with his sacrifice and that's what it takes you say why did Abel have to die but you look at that type we all had to die on The Altar that old man that old that old Cain life that Old King body and you still have that potential in you well these bodies they're under that curse they're under that curse of sin amen we could go from here and and we could die we could we could die of whatever Anything could happen to these bodies these bodies could be destroyed we were under that curse amen but Abel Abel died on that altar with this sacrifice amen amen we have to we have to crucify these bodies got to crucify these lives amen to live live that life amen to follow Jesus amen amen so if we can see if we can begin to see where what Adam lost and what Jesus done for for us we can see we're at what what Adam lost where he fell from and where where Christ is bringing us amen we can begin to see a picture of what Christ has in store for us and what what he's done for us by this Redemptive act amen if we can see amen by Revelation what he has done for us we can begin to have the right kind of faith I mean because if we're a son or daughter of God Amen you can live below your privileges if you don't recognize what God done for him and that's you are a son you're living below your privileges today you're living below the authority amen that God is as a Son of God Amen in The Inheritance as a Son of God has for you you can live below that we want to see amen we want to see what he has for us amen we want to have the right kind of faith we want to have the right kind of Faith to be able to overcome in this hour Amen to have the victory amen how many Razorback fans we got in here amen got the victory how'd that make you feel if you like the Razorbacks how much more my wife told me I had to preach this how much more has the Sons and Daughters of God should we have the victory this morning amen by the word we ought to be able to see ourselves see what Jesus done for us see that he's our conqueror see that he defeated death Hell In The Grave amen we're more than conquerors this morning by him through him that loved us hey man we've got the victory this morning amen I'll give my voice for that this morning amen I'll I'll expend my voice amen I'll I'll use every bit of it for that this morning amen we've been made more than conquerors the prison chains have been broken him in the Prison Walls amen the pawn shop he didn't just take us out of the pawn shop but he destroyed the pawn shop he bought the whole pawn shop and bulldozed it down and destroyed it amen for any remembrance amen that's what the blood does and then it takes away every remembrance that's good yes sir faith is a victory this morning if you can lay hold if you're going to lay hold on the land that came forth if you can lay your hands and identify yourself and come under that worship of the one that came forth amen it'll give you that victory praise the Lord amen so we're under we're under the expectation amen of fullness of redemption we understand what that is the fullness of redemption Jesus Paid the price redemption's been paid amen but Redemption amen as we as we said before it were going back to something we're being restored back to something so Redemption we are in the process of redemption we can say this morning that we're redeemed that we're redeemed if you have the Holy Ghost In You amen you've been sealed until the day of your Redemption there's nothing there's nothing Satan can do to take that seal off if he could he could be your brother he could he could access that but there's nothing he can do to take that seal off you have been sealed by the Holy Ghost until the day of your Redemption amen and we're living amen under that expectation amen that I've got the earnest within me I've got something that came amen it wasn't just an emotion it wasn't just something that somebody talked me into but it's something that changed my life it changed my nature it changed me from who I was amen it's changing me now amen and I'm in the process I may not be what I want to be but thank God I'm not what I used to be amen I'm in the process of redemption of coming back to what I was in God amen amen and when that happens when the fullness of redemption comes this body is going to be changed in the moment in the twinkling of an eye and we're going to be caught up together with our Lord to meet him in the air amen amen the next time when you see Jesus you're not going to see him in these bodies he's not going to see you you're not going to meet him in these bodies but you're gonna meet him Amen in a full am in a fully redeemed body amen amen there's not going to be any habits linging there's not going to be anything attached on to you amen there's going to be a fullness of redemption a full restoration that's right amen so by faith I mean we're living under that Amen in faith in the one who was able to redeem us and we live under that expectation amen amen the one that's the one who has claimed to redempt to rights upon his people I mean that's who we have faith in amen this evening this this morning amen it was God's plan all along to bring us back amen it's good we read here Romans 8 15. I don't think I gave this to the brother for we have not received a spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father amen so either they're the that word adoption is the placing of sons so it's bringing us back into our position and we have not received as the Bible says a spirit of fear again to bondage and that word bondage means slavery a condition of a Slave we've not received that Spirit we've not received that Spirit we've not received a spirit of fear a spirit of hold but Satan would have a hold on us a spirit of slavery amen but we've received the spirit of adoption that God is placing me that he's bringing me into my position amen as a son or daughter of God Amen that I'm not living below my privileges amen break that slave mindset that Satan would put on you break that mindset that you're not good enough break that mind say that your mind said that you're not going to make it amen you are going to make it if you're a seed of God you're going back to the beginning and when the sea is going to return to itself amen the Sons and Daughters of God have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry have a father father God I know I'm not good enough but you're worthy I'm not worthy but you're worthy right I know I'm not good enough but you're good enough your blood is good enough this morning and I don't have to live under fear that I'm not gonna make the Rapture that I'm not good enough amen he's made me good enough amen we've heard the word we've heard the word amen this is our year of Jubilee you ain't got to wait on it we're living in the Year of Jubilee we're living under when the lamb has taken the book amen he's loose to seals he's opened up everything that we have need of we're living under that amen we're living under the sound of freedom shake the bondage shake the mindset that you're not a son or daughter of God shake that mindset of the world the world will try to drag you along with it the world will try to drag you down try to bring you with it and there's a hill waiting there's a hell waiting for the unbeliever hell's hot it's real yeah there's a hell there's also a heaven there's also a millennium that the people of God are going to you believe that don't let the world drag you down don't let it bring you with you amen but come up come up higher yeah let me come apart let me not come under the influence of the world let me come up higher as a minister as a Believer they may not come under the spirit of laodicea that lukewarm condition but let me discern let us discern Amen Let Us discern and withstand every evil spirit amen that would rise against us let us discern amen those are the evil spirits that would enter our homes let us discern and withstand anything that would come against the word amen it's a glorious time for the believer it's a glorious time for the believer remember living we're living under Redemption claims here Ephesians 1 to talk about the fullness of times just just for a moment here what brother Brown said because I believe it ties together because we're coming to a culmination as the song goes amen we're coming we're coming to the Head we're coming to the to the end of all things we're coming to the end of time itself amen amen time is no longer amen the the days of the time for denomination is over we're coming we're coming to the fullness of times amen Ephesians 1 5 having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and Prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will and then we're living under the time of all Mysteries have been revealed everything's finished up we're at the end of the church age there's nothing left there's nothing left to go to there's nothing left Beyond this would come amen the mystery has been finished we're at the finishing up of everything when we understand the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he had purposed in himself amen he purpose in himself amen amen Redemption all along that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will so there in verse 10 it talks about the dispensation of the fullness of times now he might Gather in Christ and brother Branham says here in adoption he says do you believe in dispensations the Bible said so in the dispensation of the fullness of time he said what is the fullness of time there's been a dispensation of well of Mosaic law the dispensation of John the Baptist there was a dispensation of Christ there was a dispensation of church organization and there was a dispensation of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit he said but now in the dispensation of adoption when the world's waiting groaning and when the fullness of time comes when the dispensation of that fullness of time he said what is it when the dead Rises when the sick ceases when all Earth ceases to groan the fullness of the dispensation of time so we're not living just under just a Revival we're not living we could go back in we're not living under the days of Christ amen we're not here to repeat what Jesus done amen verbatim Every Act what he done because those days are over right and so we have to move on from that we benefit from that and we have to have faith in that but we move on because God Amen is moving right the holy spirit is moving and so amen we're not even living under just an outpouring of the Holy Spirit we want an outpouring of the Holy Spirit we are beneficiaries of of that amen but also All Flesh is a beneficiary of that the weed and the tares amen they receive the same Reign they receive that same outpouring amen but there's something even beyond that there's something Beyond even just the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your own life but you've got to move on from that Amen to a maturing Amen to the fullness of time Amen to where God is bringing us in this Redemption plan amen not just a savior not just to clean you up not just to use you in this life fill you with the Holy Ghost amen but to change your body to bring you to the completeness under the Redemptive act under the claims that have been made upon you and I that if we live long enough that if we stay alive that we which are alive and remain amen shall not hinder this then which are asleep and under the fullness of times amen under the under this dispensation and when the church is moving up in the Holy Ghost series he said we've came from justification sanctification to the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said where God is going to unite or this church so much so much he's going to pour himself so much into her that the dead in Christ will raise and when they without us cannot be made perfect I believe that's what the message teaches I'm not looking for anybody to come back and call forth that Resurrection amen but as we near Christ amen the dead will raise as we near the fullness of times it can't help but take place thank you right I'm sorry that I'm yelling that but I wanted to be so real to myself I wanted to be more than just a head knowledge I don't want to be a reality that we're living in that time that there's no going back no time to turn back there's no time to look back we've got to look forward we've got to raise our raise our hands Lift Our Heads amen for our time and then when we see these things begin to come apart come to pass a turmoil amen the condition of everything when we see things moving into their place amen Jesus said lift up your head for your Redemption your redemptions are off nah amen God amen amen is going to bring you to that fullness of redemption the Holy Ghost Inside you that earnest the down payment's already been made you're going there we which are alive and remain if we're here if you're alive if I'm alive if the Lord tarries my children grow up yeah yeah they're going to be part of that body change that rapture they already are amen I believe that I believe we're living under under the token I believe we're living under the blood where the death angel if it's applied the death angel has to pass I believe under that token I believe we bring every every loved one with us I believe that I mean they didn't leave a hoof behind they didn't leave no one behind when they left Egypt but under under that blood amen and we're under that blood are we not is that what we believe is that what we've identified our lives with we're under that blood when we shall go forth amen so the fullness of time brother Ram says here in adoption he says I have an inheritance an inheritance of eternal life now God sent Jesus to make that inheritance real to me because there was nothing I could do to inherit it it was blank it was valid there was nothing I could do but in the fullness of time God sent in his own good time Jesus the lamb slain from the foundation of the world his blood was shed that I might go to my inheritance to be what what inheritance the sonship to be the Son of God to be a Son of God as we said earlier if if you if you miss that if you're living below that privilege you're missing the whole thing you're missing the whole thing amen if you're just a good church member you're missing the whole thing to be a son amen under under that under that inheritance is your Authority is your rights is where you speak as a son amen we're not just servants here we're sons and daughters amen excuse me here amen so he sent his son Amen in the fullness of time then he said he goes on and said this might choke you to death but did you know that men that are the sons of God are amateur gods he said how many ever know that how many knows that Jesus said that did not your laws say itself that you are gods and if you call them Gods he said which in God said in Genesis 2 they were Gods because they were and so we're going back to Genesis right we're going back to Genesis they were gods of the earth they had full domain he said they had full domain and dominion over the world he give the Dominion them dominion over all things so that's what that's what you're going back to as a Son of God Amen if you've been restored back to that if you've come under that amen and they've got that Revelation that I'm a son of God you've got Dominion you have a domain amen and we'll go on here we'll get into something here just a little bit but he talked about he said he lost his godship he lost his sonship he lost his domain Satan took it over he said but brother we're waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God who will come back and take it over again waiting for the fullness of time when the pyramid gets to the top when the sons of God will be manifest when the power of God will walk out and take every Power that Satan's got away from him yes sir it belongs to him he said is that down the road is that down the road or is it now well that's up to you that's up to you if you want to live below your privileges or you want to come up to your privileges because I believe that we as as the blood as brothers said the blood has taken us back has redeemed us back to what Adam Lost In the Garden of Eden amen so I want to live in my potential I want to live I mean I want to live under that Authority I'm going to take back my domain every Power he said every Power to take every Power that Satan's got away from him yes sir oh my God oh my God oh my the prison bars have been broken the chains have been broken amen and if someone doesn't have enough faith for themselves amen your faith as a Son of God as a daughter of God Amen you have that right amen you have that right as a son or daughter of God Amen upon your inheritance upon your family upon your children right upon your brothers and sisters amen we have a right amen this morning to kick the devil in the teeth we have a route this morning as the Church of God Amen if you'll just come amen if you'll realize if you'll realize where you are in time where if you'll realize where we are and then where God is bringing us through amen if you'll realize what's under your feet amen you'll be more than a conqueror and we are more than conquerors try to get through this we got about 14 pages left 13 pages I'll cut you all short last time I messed up I messed up I I kicked myself in the in the foot for that we missed something maybe we'll get to it here the fundamental 1955 the fundamental foundation for faith he said we want to talk about the Son of God we're kind of going without a fallen Son of God I believe brother Joel mentioned this quote and not when he mentioned it I I had read this also brother Rob says no matter what a state a man's Inn yet he's a son of God no matter how sinful he is how far away he is how Fallen he is but yet he's a son and God is his Creator God is his maker and God has bought him with a price and he may never reconcile himself to that he may never accept it he may never do him any good but yet he's a son and she is a daughter of God amen amen uh though bum you see up there down the road I know some of y'all seen him coming in that's the son of God that's the Son of God God made him to be a Son of God or whoever that was if it was a woman a daughter of God God made him that way and whether or not they accept it whether or not they come to it God has that for them God God made them to be that right and brother REM says here he said if we miss I always like to say if you miss being a son or daughter of God then you missed the mark yeah he said and to miss some more is the definition of sin he said when you're sitting in a gun and at 50 yards and you're you're you're driving tax but then you move out a couple hundred yards in your your five inches off he said you're off the target you've missed the mark he said but what you got to do you got to come back he said but if I miss I if I miss faith in God I've got to get tuned up he said there's something wrong if I miss faith in God he said if I miss being a Christian I need to come back and be tuned up I say this morning if you if you miss being a son or daughter of God you're living below your privileges you're living below where God amen what God made you to be and then for God put us here to be that to worship Him to live for him that's what God designed man for in the beginning if you're off to one side if I'm off to one side I need to come back and be tuned up by the scripture by the word what says here in John 1 I always love this scripture he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not and he came unto his own in his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God I couldn't do it on my own I couldn't inherit it myself amen but he gave power to those that received him those those that he came to rejected him but as many as received him as many as they can receive the word for their day amen amen to them gives he power to become the sons of God eminent and sons of God even to them that believe on his name and it goes on which we're born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of God amen he gave me power it wasn't my power but he gave me power I've got no power of my own Amen to come into anything amen but there's a power available there's a power available you can live beat down I'm gonna go back to this you can live beat down you can live depressed every day of your life but if you'll come to an identification that I'm a Son of God if you'll let that come to you if you if you'll stay quiet long enough if you'll get out of the pity party long enough and let God come down and tell you that you're my son that you're my daughter and I give unto you my power I give you back your Authority that's what you were made for you weren't made to live defeated you were made to live Victorious amen when God done that for me it's changed my life ever since before that I I'll be honest with our struggle with a had the holy ghost or not you're up and down you're in and you're out you're a Judas one day and you're a Son of God the next you don't know but if you'll get still just just for one moment if you'll come into His presence and let him seek that reality in it'll change your life and through the ups and downs and they're going to come every day there's ups and downs there's no no telling what we'll face but it'll be your stay amen he'll be the captain of the ship he'll be the one that calms the wind in your life amen I can't go out there and calm no wind I'd go out here and I could holler at the wind all day but if God speaks that through me the Holy Ghost speaks that through you you can speak to the storm yes you can holler at the cold weather all you want there's nothing going to change but if God speaks it through you if you need it it will be there we're coming to that fullness of adoption amen amen so we were able to receive him amen receive the word for your day brother run said that's the evidence of the Holy Ghost right if you can if you can receive the word for your day that's the evidence of the Holy Ghost when the spirit of truth comes he shall show you all things and so we were able to receive that we were in his thinking from the beginning amen you say you're really talking yourself up that's what the prophet told me that's what the Bible tells me I'm gonna I'm gonna believe what the messenger told me about myself that's all I can believe I can't go listen to so and so on the internet and some some Big Time mega church preacher and they could have awesome preaching that's not what that's not their worship that we're under yeah that's not the anointing that we're under we could have an outpouring here today the church down the road could have an outpouring because the rain falls on the just in the unjust but the word has come to you and I and we understand amen where we're going amen that's good as many as received him gave he the power to become the sons of God it's available to you today I don't know how long I've been preaching here we certainly love the Lord this morning don't you amen so so that power to them gave he power Authority it gives you the right it gives you the Liberty it gives you the jurisdiction and the strength amen now now you're coming back you're coming back to what Adam lost that power is a son of God Amen brother Brown says here in the Seal of God he says but as many as received him gave he the power to become The Offspring of God he gave he give unto them eternal life eternal life comes from the Greek word Zoe Zoe is that live Zoe is the life of God and he said I like this he said and if the life of God living in you it produces a Godly life just as certain as I'm standing here in this platform do you believe that this morning amen and the the man that's God it can no more perish than God can perish because God is in the name amen and he that heareth my words and believeth on him that send me hath everlasting life and shall not come in the condemnation but hath everlasting life do you believe that this morning amen the blood is removed the shame the the blood has removed the condemnation the Judgment that that means the Judgment of damnation that condemnation amen has been removed from my life amen has been removed from your life amen Jesus has taken the condemnation away amen Satan would try to put every bit of that on you he tried to put you in hell amen but God's gonna put you in a Rapture God's going to put you in a body chain he's already made a way it's a life of God amen amen it's what gives us strength it's what gives us the ability it's what gives us the courage amen amen to live for God Amen to live for Jesus amen and to be to be able to take up your cross and follow him and then to be able to die to yourself amen that he can come and live and speak through you you love the Lord this morning he said and I'll say here that now we've become the manifested attributes we are the thoughts of God we were in him in the beginning amen we were in him in the beginning so we had to come back amen we had to come back under Redemption claim if you're a son or daughter of God he's not going to lose you amen the son of man came to seek and save that which was lost right yes and I always like this here in the church ages where the room said we did not become seed by the rebirth we were seed and therefore we were reborn for only the elect can be reborn because we were seed is the reason we could be quick and amen there's there's Fallen sons of God there's Fallen sons of God Walk in this Earth but if there's not something in there to Quicken buy predestination nothing will happen and they may become a good church member you understand they may go on and be in heaven they they there is a place for that amen but as the seed of God and I believe that's who I'm preaching to here today amen you didn't become something you always were something and the Holy Ghost amen the sea within you that Holy Ghost was there to Quicken that it was laying in there all your life you knew you were different you knew you knew you you knew better you knew better come on you're taught better even if you weren't taught better you knew you were different if you're a seed of God and you can identify with that this morning amen you never you were different you knew you you shouldn't be doing those things amen but one day a predestinated moment to a predestinated seed of God in you amen amen you didn't you weren't you weren't just reborn for any old reason you didn't just come to it like that amen amen because of the sea within you you could be born again the seed's not there and nothing to Quicken there's nothing to bring that forth Amen in the the grain the grain is going back to itself again it has come to itself again the grain that went down in the first church age it has come back to itself again right yes and this thought that we said earlier amen we're going back to what Adam lost we're going back to Genesis we're going back to that Eden because everything everything that had a beginning every seed every every every Doctrine every church every cult every every idea began in Genesis right and so so we're going back yeah we're going back to that but I'm going back hey man I'm not going I'm not just going back so far I'm going back all the way the seed of God Amen within me that life within me has taken me all the way back I'm not going to pick back up where Adam amen we're right right there where he fell and get back into the mess again amen before going back amen before Adam fell before Satan got his greasy old hands on our life amen amen and amen in the message teaches that we're going to live out that day amen we're going to go live out that day that Adam didn't live out we're going to live a thousand years amen during a millennial Reign amen during a thousand years of Peace amen where Christ is going to sit that's ruler upon this Earth amen he's gonna sit amen and there will be peace remember there's got to be a peace here this morning there's got to be a peace he's got to be the ruler on your heart but got to be an Eden in your heart now and brother Brown goes on here to say and we look at what did Adam lose he had perfect Fellowship when we go on here brother Brown says now in the beginning when God made man to worship Him Live and live God taking care of him fed him man had a perfect fellowship with God there was nothing wrong and God come down it's a beautiful picture this just listen to it God came down in the evening and talked to Adam and Eve what a beautiful picture no harm nothing could harm them no sickness could ever come to them they didn't even know what sickness was they didn't know what old age was they didn't know what being hurt was they couldn't be hurt they was in the presence of the omnipotent powers of God which held them in control and guided them by a spirit there was nothing that could harm them what a beautiful picture that is if you look at that picture their God God and man had perfect Fellowship amen a man was made to worship and have communion with his creator that's what we were designed to be and how he would come there brother around the Scout described it he would come down the cool of the evening he would take care of them they knew no harm they knew nothing they knew no sickness they knew no worry they knew no stress they knew nothing because father God was there communing with them in this condition amen this hidden condition amen there amen he just he just loved to talk with his children I mean he still loves to talk to you and take care of you today amen and he does that today what a picture and you could say well that picture just isn't quite clear on this one to me if I'm redeemed then why do I have troubles if what what you're saying is that we've been brought back to what Adam was why why do I have troubles why why do I have sickness but it's because of the Fall it's because of the fall and now God can come and express himself in a greater way than he could even to Adam and Eve for God can come down in your broken heart he can come down in your sickness and amen and be the Lord God that heals all thy diseases he can come into your trouble and be be your deliverer it can be your Hiding Place amen but the picture it just doesn't may not look right to you but it's coming together it's coming together as the fullness of time goes on as we worship under Redemption and as we as we live under Redemption claims amen we're going back to where the picture is going to be made clear again amen we're going to be known as we are known amen when we see him we shall be lock him there's more change that's got to take place there's more there's more there's more to it and remember we're walking in it we're walking in it amen so we may not be able to to have the picture just quiet exactly like they had it we may not be able to come here this service or whenever at your home and and paint it just exactly like they had it where everything's perfect but I believe we can come here today I believe we can come and we we're sitting together here in Heavenly places I believe the holy spirit is bringing us a power yes I believe it's bringing us to our position I believe it's showing us more and more of who we are and who he is amen as that happens the picture becomes clear and clearer amen is as to where when it becomes so clear there will be changed in a moment in the twinkle of an eye I'm not closing yet I ain't got much voice or much stomach much ABS I need to preach from and down here you love the Lord brother Brown says here Revelations chapter 5 said we're waiting for the fullness of adoption this will take place when at the first resurrection that's when our bodies will be changed from these vile creatures that we we are and we'll have a body like his own Glory spotting for we shall see him as he is and we shall be like him and when he appears we are we will appear in his alikeness we will have a body like his a glorious glorified body in all the trials and struggles of life will fade off into the midst and blow away Amen to be no more see the picture the pictures going to get clear the little blotches amen amen something that's out of order it's going to clear up amen Adam is the son of God what Adam lost Adam as a Son of God had dominion and complete control brother Birmingham he was said he was a secondary God he had control over all things over all the elements he could speak to the wind amen but he failed amen but there was a second Adam there was a second Adam and this was the Lord Jesus he came and he spoke to the wind he asked he asked Peter Peter seen him out on the water walking Peter said can I come walk too said come and there Peter as long as he kept his eyes on Jesus walk on water they're in the midst of the storm no telling how much ocean Underneath Him they're keeping the eyes on the master on keeping their eyes on that son of God that that that Son of God that that come that live by it is written he lived by the word where others had failed this son of God came to Perfection and if you keep your eyes on that Perfection not on yourself amen you can speak to the storm amen Jesus is in the boat amen he's in the boat all you got to do is wake him up all you got to do is wake him up amen I mean if we could let's just stand this morning we got quite a bit here but we won't get to it you love the Lord this morning read this quote here and we'll finish up with this brother says go right back to Genesis to the original what is it now the world in nature is groaning and crying everything's moving what for the manifestation of the sons of God when true Sons born Sons field Sons speak and their word is backed and I believe we're on the border of it right now they say yes sir say to this mountain let it be sold amen God that's what God's bringing us to remember going back to a Genesis and then we're going back to the original Redemption is bringing us back amen him in the word God God will back your word amen what's your what's your speak it'll be what you speak it'll be and it'll be so amen speak speak to your storm this morning speak to the mountain whatever needs you have whatever whatever you're going through whatever situation it is speak to the mountain and it'll be moved it'll be moved I believe it I believe it you say I may not see the results today for what you what you speak now amen could happen tomorrow what you prayed for today amen is as a lot of times is what happens tomorrow or the next day you're laying those seeds you're speaking that and it's going forth amen and that will materialize around the word of a son or daughter of God spoken from amen that perfect one inside them amen don't look to yourself
