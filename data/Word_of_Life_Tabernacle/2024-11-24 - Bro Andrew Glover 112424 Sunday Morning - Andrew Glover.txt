coming out for a few days to amen fellowship with us here we sure love and appreciate him amen St John chapter 5 you love the Lord this morning am amen I know this is a very familiar reading in St John chapter 5 and verse 21 I wonder this morning maybe before we read the word we could just speak to him this morning Heavenly Father Lord we are very aware of your presence that's in this building today Father we want to thank you for this assembly for this congregation oh god of people Lord these are not just church members here this morning punching Lord a religious time clock fulfilling their religious duties for the weak but Lord these are believers that love you and trust you father these are more Lord than just individuals that have heard something about your word and Lord are trying to just get by but father these are rugged Believers Lord the devil's thrown everything he can at them give them every reason and every opportunity not to be here this morning but Lord greater are you that's on the inside of our hearts than the enemy that's against us and this morning Lord we're grateful and thankful for the strength and the faith that's in our lives to serve you Lord to persevere through every trial to walk through every danger Lord and Lord to keep our eyes on you and to stay focused upon your promises now Lord as we Endeavor this morning to look into your word we want to invite you Among Us oh God may you come in the power of your Resurrection Lord may you drive out every Spirit that's unlike the Holy Spirit Lord as the Believers have broke out of the out of the cares of life and the situations and begin to entertain your presence and Lord as you just settled down in the worship now father we're asking you to come in the preaching of your word give us Lord inspiration and direction oh God and Lord we'll be sure to give thee all the praise all the honor and all the glory forgive us of our failures and our shortcomings Lord father may you transform us this morning by the renewing of our minds in your word in Jesus Christ's name we pray and all the Believers says am amen and amen amen St John chapter 5 in verse 21 for as the father raiseth up the dead and quickeneth them even so the son quickeneth whom he will for the father judgeth no man but he hath committed all judgment unto the son that all men should honor the son even as they honor the father now he that honth not the son honth not the Father which hath sent him now verily verily I say unto you he that heareth somebody say heareth he you know brother brandom translated that to understandeth he that heareth or understandeth my word and believeth on him that has sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation listen but is passed from Death unto life I love what brother BR says he said now rub that out if you can amen you cannot rub that out the word of God for verily verily I say unto you the hour is coming and now is when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God and they that hear shall live for as the father now listen as the father hath life in himself so hath he given to the son to have life in himself and hath given him authority to execute judgment also listen because he is the son of man not will be or was he is the son of man now Marvel not at this for the hour is coming that which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice and shall come forth they that have done good unto the resurrection of life and they that had done evil unto the resurrection of damnation now I want to turn to Revelations chapter 10 Revelation uh chapter 10 and I I know tonight or this morning rather that we could read this verse from heart in Revelations chapter 10 and in verse number 7 Revelations 10 and verse number 7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished can I say when he shall begin to speak as he hath declared unto his servants the prophets now one of place I want to look is back in the New Testament in St Luke St Luke chapter 17 you love the Lord this morning amen St Luke chapter 17 and another very very familiar reading St Luke chapter 17 we want to look in the the 30th verse St Luke 17 and verse 30 even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed we ask the Lord this morning to bless the reading of his word as you can have your seats today I want to by the help of the Lord for a few moments this morning if I would take a title today I want to talk to you on this obey the voice of the son of man obey the voice of the son of man uh in 1956 in a sermon called Faith priest in Charlotte North Carolina brother BR says now I'm going to ask you all to be reverent just as reverent as you can you say brother brandom what are you talking about see you're just stalling he said well I am exactly he said I am waiting for that angel of the Lord to come amen I am waiting for that angel of the Lord to come that's exactly right see I don't know none of you and how could I do anything I can't it's him I can't do it even when he comes unless your faith operates it it's not me he said I Can See Vision I cannot see Visions unless it's your faith amen that does it sure he said God's Will by Divine gift the only thing I do is just keep yielding myself and as I get myself completely yielded to the Holy Spirit then he starts talking amen the only thing I can do is get myself completely yielded to the Holy Spirit then he starts talking he said it's not me amen he is using my voice amen he is using my voice but it's not me it's him see that's exactly amen what the scripture said I wonder this morning how many could declare that you believe that God can speak anden you believe with all of your heart that God is able Amen to speak brother said if you can hear a voice amen speaking to you that's God Amen because it copes with the scripture he said if it doesn't then there's some kind of a wrong voice amen that's speaking to you but the right voice amen will tell you to follow the rules of the Bible he said there's no sprinkling there's no pouring no falsely amen come right straight out amen and follow the rules of the Bible so this is a voice amen that is calling you out of something amen but it's also bringing you to something so it's not just calling you out Amen to leave you in limbo so to speak but it's calling you out Amen to bring you into something and that is amen into the rules or the instructions of the word of God I believe that God Amen has spokesmen that he raises up in every age and I don't believe that those spokesmen come Amen on their own accord or on their own ability amen but rather I believe God sends his spokesman Amen to speak on his behalf in Hebrews 12 and verse 25 Paul said amen see that ye refuse not him that speaketh for if they escape not who refused him that spake on Earth amen then how much more shall not we escape amen if we turn away from him that speaketh from Heaven amen now watch if we turn away from him amen that speaketh from heaven when you look here amen if this word speaketh it means to articulate sounds it means to declare one's mind amen by speech or by sound now when you think about this word sound how many knows that there's actually two types of sounds brother identifies them he said one is a certain sound he said and the other is an uncertain sound in 1 Corinthians 14:8 Paul says amen if the trumpet give an uncertain sound amen then who shall prepare himself to the battle in Revelation chap 1 and verse 10 again John says I was in the spirit amen on the Lord's day amen and I heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet amen if a trumpet give an uncertain sound amen then who shall prepare himself for the battle amen now watch and and look and I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and I heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet now in the seven Church ages 54 brother said a trumpet amen is an announcement he said Gable at the coming of the Lord shall sound the Trump of God he said this was God's trumpet blowing in other words he's fixing to announce amen the Eternal destination of the world so when you hear a trumpet amen it is an announcement or a voice amen that is getting ready to announce the etern oh my announce the Eternal destination of the world he said now a trumpet what is it amen get ready I'm going going to give you amen the revelation of Jesus Christ to give to the church he said I will speak to you amen and what will be the destination of the world Amen is for those who receive amen and those who reject amen so your attitude towards the Revelation that is coming amen from the trumpet that is sounding amen will determine the destination that you will go to he said a trumpet of God is attention amen every man when the the trumpet blows amen he grabs his sword amen and stands to a place of attention listen when this Revelation come in this age amen it was not coming Amen to bring us to a picnic amen but it was coming to bring us to a battlefield Amen in other words if you're going to make it to Heaven you're going to have to fight to get there brother said and if you go to hell he said you're going to have to fight over the blood over the cross over a song service over a testimony amen you're going to have to fight your way to Hell amen and you're going to have to fight your way to heaven you know what I say if we got to fight our way to Hell amen then why not take that same energy amen that you're going to use to fight your way to Hell amen and put it against the devil amen and fight your way to heaven listen we are not here as just soldiers amen with a with a fake uniform on Amen but we have heard the gospel trumpet in his announced the son of man amen has returned to the Church of the say this we are not listening to any kind of a trumpet amen we are listening to the gospel trumpet on Amen we are listening to the gospel trumpet where said oh you can go ahead and take that uncertain sound if you want to he said but I like the gospel trumpet amen that gives a certain sound he said what is the gospel trumpet it is the good news that's right amen he is here now amen now there's nothing uncertain about that amen what are you saying preacher I'm saying amen that there is nothing uncertain amen about the Revelation that Jesus Christ is not in a grave in Jerusalem neither is he in a tomb in Jeffersonville amen but he is right here this morning in the power of his resurrection amen declaring that he is not the god of yesterday alone or the god of tomorrow but he is the god of right now listen God promised in Malachi 4 amen that he would send a prophet amen listen that is not going to be any kind of prophet it's going to be a true Prophet because a true prophet of God Amen is God sent and not man-made amen now let me say this when God sends a prophet it's because he sending his voice amen into the Earth brother said God has kept his voice alive amen from Eden amen and since he now how has he done it he has done it through the prophets amen go God has kept his voice alive amen all the way from Eden Amen to Eden through the prophets said when Abel was silenced amen the devil said I've got it amen but God raised up Seth he said look and the same voice that spoke in Eden amen is speaking here today think about that friends the same voice amen that was speaking all the way back in Eden amen is speaking right here in Word of Life Tabernacle and Hardy Arkansas Amen on a Sunday morning you say how could that be amen because it's not the voice of a man you're hearing it's the voice of God that is failed behind the voice of a man that is speaking I want to make an announcement to you this morning it is very important to believe amen he that God sends it is very important to receive amen him that God sends you say how important is it well a work of God Amen is believing on on him who God hath sent remember said in the Dark Ages amen the word somebody shout the word he said the word was almost entirely lost to the people he said but God sent Luther with a word he said then God sent Wesley amen and he was the voice with the word in his day he said and the people who took his Revelation from God Amen became the living Epistles amen they were read and known of all men for their generation and when the Methodist failed God raised up others amen and so it has gone on through the years until in this last day there is again another people in the land who under their messenger amen will be the final voice Amen to the final age listen the voice that was in Luther got into Wesley and the voice that was in Wesley got into Pentecost and the voice that was in Pentecost came into the Joshua anointing on the seventh angel to call the bride out of a leoty and age into a bright age amen but may I announce to you this morning amen that the voice of God is Not silenc amen but there is a people in the house of God this morning who are not above their messenger they are underneath their Messer and they are the voice of God in this generation he said you got to get the Living Word in you Amen to have the Living God in you because the word Here Is God When It's Made flesh in you he said when it goes into your flesh and your faith it becomes life amen then you are a living example listen if this message is in your soul this morning you are more than just a church member you are more than just a religious person but you are the voice of God in this age underneath the authority of the seventh Angels message my goodness somebody shout hallelujah and then is it okay to preach a little bit this morning amen it is important to receive Amen to believe he that speaketh but can I say this it's also important Amen to obey the voice amen I love this will you remember this amen receive the angel amen believe the angel and obey the angel and then don't ever forget that receive the angel believe the angel and obey the angel in Exodus 23 and: 20 the Bible said behold amen I send an angel before thee Amen to keep thee in the way and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared he said Beware of him and obey his voice and provoke him not for he will not pardon your transgressions amen look for my name is in him but if Thou shalt indeed obey his voice and do all that I speak amen now watch this there is a blessing then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies amen and an adversary under thine adversaries amen what caused God to become your enemy's enemy and what caused God to become your adversary's adversary I'll tell you what done it was when you receive the angel when you believe the angel but when you obey the angel he said for my angel shall go before thee and he will bring thee into the amorites and the Hittites and the parasites and the Canaanites and the hites and the jebusites now watch this and I will cut them off amen look what else he says he said don't bow down to their gods amen do not serve them do not do after their Works amen but thou shall utterly overthrow them amen and quiet break down their images look and you shall serve amen the Lord your God oh I love this and he shall bless thy bread amen and bless thy water and I will take sickness away amen from the midst of thee listen friends what raw a blessing amen upon the children of God was not just receiving the angel or believing the angel but when they begin to obey the angel amen God come down and he begin to fight their battles what are you saying I'm saying Church of the Living God Amen this battle is not yours it don't belong to you amen this battle belongs to God but he has sent a message in this hour and it is a message of authority and if you will come underneath the headship of the voice of the angel amen God will fight your battles amen God will heal the sick God Will Save The Lost God will raise the dead I'm not talking about a man's voice I'm talking about the voice of God sir Hallelujah now you know the Bible said amen that to behold Amen to obey is better than sacrifice amen I met some people that if they had learned that they could go long way with God on well we might as well preach it Sunday morning amen to obey is better than sacrifice and then they get so spiritual they forget they got to obey the word of God obedience is very important amen obedience is the best amen and we know what obedience does obedience unlocks amen the supernatural I love in Genesis 22:15 it says the angel of the Lord amen he called un Abraham out of the heaven the second time you know what he said he said by myself have I sworn amen saith the Lord for because thou H has done this thing and H has not withheld thy son amen thine only son look that in blessing I Will Bless thee and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed amen as the stars of the heaven and as the sand which is upon the seashore listen and thy seed amen shall possess amen the gates of his enemy so in other words Brother David The Obedience amen did not just unlock the blessing of God Amen upon the parents but it unlocked the blessing of God upon the seed oh Church of the Living God Amen in thy seed amen shall the nations of the earth be blessed amen why because thou Hast obeyed my voice listen Church Abraham amen took Isaac up on the mountain and he laid him down to sacrifice him amen but God provided a ram look look I God Amen was not looking for Abraham to kill Isaac he was was looking for Abraham's obedience Amen to the voice that was speaking to him what are you saying I'm saying parents amen it really pays off when you obey the voice of God listen Amen to obey what a prophet said amen will unlock a blessing upon your babies upon your grandbabies listen upon Generations ahead of you amen but the very minute you crisscross or you delute what a prophet said about a situation is the very minute you will lock the blessings of god well we might as well preach it Sunday morning amen let's just go to a basic one amen forsake not the assembling of yourselves together listen that is not brother bram's voice that is the voice of God but he sent a prophet in this generation to reveal to the church at every time amen that the church doors are open if you got God in your hearts you can't wait to get in there and to fellowship with your brothers and your sisters now yall know it's an age leot to see and lukewarmness amen we're going to church has become optional you know if we can make it we'll be there if we can't we won't amen we'll stream we'll get a used to be get the tape but now we just get the stream and and and oh God I'm out just go ahead and preach amen and people was more faithful when they got the tape out of the library than half of them are now with it on their cell phone you know why because it's a layo ofy in lukor spirit amen that wants to conquer the fire of God Amen that is burning in the church right I think of it sometimes how y'all y'all know brother Jonathan Martin out here Amen brother Wendell and Chan's brother brother Jonathan's father-in-law brother ml Apple y'all know brother Merl Amen brother Merl years ago they come out of a false Doctrine situation I hope it's okay to share this it's a powerful testimony they come out of a bad situation and brother Merl had three girls and a son and he said you know he told me this one time he said brother the Andrew he said we were living about 2 hours away from church he said now we went every service I I said every service he said every service I said even on Wednesdays he said yeah we went on Wednesdays he said I had to get up at 3: or 4:00 in the morning and go to work he said but we would drive two hours there he said we would drive two hours back he said I would sleep on the way back get up when I got home and go to work I thought my goodness amen but then it just dawned on me amen all those years of sacrifice amen all those years it wasn't easy but what he was doing was he was obeying the word of God and today years later amen he is reaping the benefits amen of the obedience to the word of God he's got three daughters and they're all married to preachers amen he's got grandbabies in the house of God Amen that they they lost their son a few years ago in a tragic accident but he's waiting on the shores of Glory I just got to thinking about that amen and all because he simply obeyed amen the voice of the son of man when he said forsake not the assembling of yourselves together listen Abraham until he fully obeyed God Amen the blessing never come until he fully obeyed God Amen and when he come to full obedience amen then God brought the full blessing amen full obedience will bring amen the full blessing I'll say this amen God is not interested in your education he is not interested in how spiritual you are or how much you think you know amen God is interested in our obedience and when God God sends a prophet amen he sends him to say things listen that sometimes he don't even want to say he said listen whether they liked it or not whether they crucified him whether they stoned him whatever they did amen God had spoken his heart and he must say it listen not to be different amen but to be obedient when God sent a prophet he said see he had so much complete control of him till he was their voice he said oh give me a church that's so completely Anointed with God Amen till their very a action every move is thus sayith the Lord amen they will walk in that the kind of Glory he said I will show you a messiah which is an anointed one of God Amen look standing upon the Earth amen will you remember that amen not sitting upon the Earth amen but standing upon the Earth you say what is the Messiah amen the Messiah was was the word amen in its fullness let me just say this the signs of God Amen are always overlooked said one of God's signs amen is the coming of a prophet he said and they Overlook it every time he said but those who are elected to see it amen they do see it he said but the coming of a prophet amen was the sign amen that God is ready to speak cuz if God ain't going to speak amen the prophet wouldn't be on the earth come on come on church if God wasn't ready to speak amen the prophet wouldn't be on the earth he said now remember that he wouldn't be on the earth unless God was ready to speak so we find then that there is a sign amen and there is a voice brother said the sign is given to an audience Amen to hear the voice he said he wants an audience he wants somebody that's going to listen to what he is going to say the sign is an alert it is to attract the attention of the people listen that the word is getting ready to speak amen listen when you see the sign amen the sign is not the attraction amen that we are to focus on Amen the sign is the attention getter but the voice is the focus of the age oh Church of the Living God many will see the sign but only elected amen will hear the voice what are you saying the voice is amen the voice is the word and just as Abraham was elected Amen to hear the voice amen there is a bride on the Earth today who is elected to open up their mind and let the word come in amen and forsake all five outer senses amen forsake all five inner senses amen and March with the word hallelujah the word is calling you come on come on Church the word is calling you to march with the word I love this brother said the principle amen of obedience paraphrasing now listen let me just say say this y'all remember at the wedding when Jesus was there and they were having a wedding feast and brother Joe they got about halfway through it and all of a sudden they ran out of wine you know and they said man we need some wine ain't nowhere to go get none anden so what they done was they took some water in a pot and brother Jeff they brought it over there and they set it down before the Lord Jesus and many of them just looked at it and they said well all it is is water but in St John Chapter 2 and verse 5 the Bible says his mother spoke up and said un the servant whatsoever he saith unto you amen do it whatever he saith unto you amen just do it brother said that's still amen good teaching tonight whatever he saith unto you just do it if he tells you to make ready for death amen then you get ready if he tells you you're going to get well amen then you believe it if he tells you you're healed then you are whatever he says amen you just do it to disbelieve it it is a sin so when God gives instruction amen he does not give those as suggestions amen but he gives those as instructions to be followed I love this in 1 Corinthians 15:3 Paul says amen I delivered unto you first of all that which also received how that Christ died for our sins amen according to the scripture you know what that word delivered means it means to deliver something verbally now listen friends to deliver something verbally I love what the prod of God says in the very first sermon we have recorded the very first words of a prophet's voice Amen on a on a recording says this we are getting some new gadgets for recording amen why were they bringing a tape player amen into existence because there was some instructions that was going to come forth from the voice of the son of man goes on to 1953 and he says the only thing I can do amen is to deliver the message amen just like he told me so listen we're not hearing it the way brother so and so heard it or the way this listen friends thank God that this morning we don't have to rely Amen on some man who was sitting in brother Bam's meetings to know what to preach to this bride but because God who is faithful to his word and would not allow one iota of his word to be changed he allowed the voice to be recorded so that we could stand here today and know exactly what he meant on marriage and divorce know exactly what he meant on predestination know exactly what he meant on the Seven Seals because it was more than just a sermon it was the voice it was up to the spokesman to deliver it but it's up to us to receive it he said listen now that Jesus had died amen that's God's covenant amen but he raised again he said then the Same Spirit was on him is in the church and it is Promised by God that it would be to the end of the world it's up to you to receive it I love this one God Amen is Duty bound to send it it's up to you to receive it whether you want it or not listen God pokes his religion down nobody's throat God pokes his religion down nobody's throat let me just go aad and read the rest of the quote he said the preacher might do it amen but God does it amen the preacher might poke amen but God don't now amen y'all just relax and preach with me this morning amen cuz some of y'all been like me and sat through them poking so sessions you know amen just poking poking poking poking poke amen and you're not agreeing and they just pokeing poke and poke and poke and they see you're not amen and so they just keep poking and well I don't like to be poked amen so don't poke me preach to me amen and if you want me to shout amen then preach the message if you want me to Rejoice then say something that the holy ghost in my soul can bear witness with a word and I can rejoice in the blessing of it I don't like to be poked well we might as well just preach a amen got we're now amen just poke and pokeing poke he listen I think it's time to get back to preaching the message and if somebody wants to shout let them Shout out if they want to cry let them cry if they want to stand let them stand if they want to sit Let Them Sit amen if they want to raise their hands let them raise their hand but for the love of God can we just get back Amen to preaching the message and quit trying to get everybody to shout and dance oh well you say preacher you're pretty you're pretty bold I am listen I believe in shout y'all know that y'all know me for years I believe in dancing and running the a amen but give me something to shout about amen amen somebody get Shout Shout Shout Shout amen shout shout amen I'll shout if I want to amen but let me hear the word of God let me hear the message listen don't poke me preach the word then somebody say well you ain't receiving and I oh God we're here y'all know it's the truth and then they get up brother Danny they ain't study they ain't got nothing to say it's been a month of Sunday since they sit down and cracked open their Bible and listen to a tape and they think just because they're holding the my microphone you ought to be shouting from Pew to Pew let me say this amen this message is worth studying and it's worth preaching God told me not long ago he said brander I don't have the ability to preach it I said let me say this go in your study and listen to a tape and write you 10 things down from that tape and go to the pull pit and say it and I promise you that the same angel of God that anointed a prophet to say it will show up on the pulpit when you read it and he will back it with the same anointing anden it ain't a poking religion it's obedience to the word of God yes sir I know I know it might get a little touch touchy there but it's the truth anyhow man I didn't come to church to be poked and neither did you come on well glory to God it's Sunday morning in the house of God y'all know it's the truth poking poking and they get on tangents and poking poking poking come on and then you don't agree and they'll go find one-sided quotes and pokeing pokeing poking on well glory to God and they get the spiritual poking poking come on Bible don't say poke the word it says preach the word the only thing the messenger can I'm GNA move on the only thing the messenger can do is deliver the message he said now listen if God sent the messenger and Vindicated by the signs that he was the messenger sent from God then it's up to them to obey their messenger listen exactly they must obey the messenger and have respects to that messenger in Exodus 12 I I just know sometimes people get to thinking well uh God requires a lot out of us well let's look here in Exodus 12 and verse one the Bible says when God gives Moses the instructions of applying the token the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt saying this month shall be unto you the beginning of months it shall be the first month of the year to you now speak ye to all the congregation of Israel and say in the 10th day of this month shall they take to every man a lamb according to the house of their fathers amen a lamb for a house and if the household be too little for the lamb then let him and his neighbor next unto his house take it according to the number of the souls every man according to his eating amen shall make your account amen for the lamb listen your lamb shall be without blemish it shall be a male of the first year you shall take it out from the sheep or from the goats and you shall keep it up until the 14th day of the month and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel amen shall kill it in the evening and they shall take of the blood and strike it on the two side post on the upper door post of the houses wherein they shall eat it and they shall eat the Flesh in the night they shall roast it with fire and un leaven bread and with bitter herbs they shall eat it eat not of it raw nor Soden it all with water but roast it with fire his head with his legs and with the bur thereof and you shall let nothing of it remain until the morning and that which remaineth amen it shall be look here and that which remaineth into the morning that which remaineth shall be burned with fire and thus shall you eat it now look how not only is he going to tell you how to get it when to cook it how to prepare it how to apply the blood of it he's even going to tell you how to eat it he says eat it with your loins girded your shoes on your feet and your staff in your hand and you shall eat it in haste for it is the Lord's Passover for I will pass through the land of Egypt this night and will Smite all the the firstborn in the land of Egypt both man and Beast and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment amen I am the Lord and the blood shall be to you for a token upon the house where you are and when I see the blood amen I will pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you amen when I smite amen the land of Egypt is it not amazing brother Joel that the Bible don't just say go get your lamb and amen slay it and slap some blood above the door amen but God gives instructions Amen on how to eat it amen where to get it from amen how to prepare it how to apply the blood when to apply can I say this amen the evidence of obedience amen was not quoting what Moses said amen but it was applying the blood amen just as Moses said in other words if Moses would have delivered the instructions and a father would have said you know what I don't think all that really matters I'll just go get me a lamb it don't matter if it's got a blemish or not I'll just slap some blood above the door and we'll just go on as we are you know what would have happened amen the death angel would have destroyed the firstborn amen but because there was a spirit of obedience amen the father said we're not going to cut corners on anything Moses said listen obedience brought the Covenant of the token into effect if the token wasn't displayed according to the the Covenant then the Covenant was not effective he said see you say oh I believe and you don't follow the instructions of the word then you don't believe see amen you be circumcised you joined something you're baptized amen done all those things amen that still ain't the token the Holy Ghost let me say this obeying the messenger is more than just quoting the messenger obeying the messenger is more than just memorizing the instructions that have been delivered by the messenger but when you obey the messenger is when you take the message into your heart remember said don't you just come this far and say I believe the message no you obey the messenger and you come into Christ you say well I believe every word brother brandom that's good but that's just being able to read he said you take the message you take it into your heart that you must have the token amen the very life that was in Christ amen be in you you say what is the message the message is Christ which is the anointed word can I just go ahead and preach here for a second amen the message is not a better thought the message of the hour amen is not a better thought I'll say this the message is the only thought people say well I don't think that matters Moses didn't say Amen I've got a better thought about the applying of the blood amen and change the instruction of the applying the blood and neither did Noah when he built the ark amen if Noah would have changed one instruction on that Ark it would have went to the Bottom of the Sea are are you with me now you know what obedience causes you to do obedience causes you to surrender your own thoughts oh my when you really obey something you surrender your own thoughts in second Corinthians chapter 10: 5 the Bible says casting down imagination and every High thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought Amen to The Obedience of Christ amen I got to thinking about something the other day amen there's a way to fix a lot of problems around a church is when you get rid of the carnal mind and you get a spiritual mind anden if you got a carnal mind you see things carnally you filter things carnally you believe things carnally you look at every situation from the carnal side but if you if you lay aside amen the carnal mind and receive the mind of Christ it will cause you Amen to see things the way God sees things come now come on we might as well preach amen cuz people get one-sided on things and they just see this and see this and see this amen but I'll tell you what your imagination will do your imagination will bind you up your imagination will put you in a dark place your imagination will lock amen the blessings of God over your home your imag ation will lock the blessings of God between you and a brother between you and a sister come on church amen I've seen it I amen I may just be 28 years old but I've been around a few days and I've seen people in churches amen start imagining things about the pastor or about the musicians or about the song leader or about the Deacon and before long their imaginations become reality amen and the only thing it was was a devil amen that got on them maybe in the form of a religious spirit amen and B them in that prison of imagination you know what I say I say it's time Amen to break out of the imaginations and come back to the word of God yes sir oh come on church amen well so and so didn't shake my hand amen am I might as well just preach Amen brother Ben amen I tell you right now amen it's been three Sundays since you shook my hand last Sunday I walked by you and you look down when I walk by I tell you brother Ben don't love me brother Ben don't like me and you'll start imagining that or the and maybe you come in the front door and every single service there's brother Harvey and he's got the door open for you he's got a smile on his face he's got a handshake to give you and this one Wednesday night you come to church and brother Harvey opened the door and he didn't smile and he didn't shake your hand and you come in church and started imagining well brother Harvey talked to so and so about me and so and so told him this and so brother Harvey don't like me amen and then the next service you come back and brother Harvey don't even open the door for you and you say I tell you that's just a confirmation right there Amen brother Harvey he don't like me I tell you what that is amen that's a devil of imagination and there's only one way to fix it amen and that is to get a backbone amen and take the word of God and obey the word of God and go to the brother and say brother have you got something against me well it's maybe we ought to get on to the turkey are you hearing me there's only one way to whip that devil of imagination and that is to take the word of God and obey the word and you say well I tell you what this is the third service and and I tell you what man brother Harvey's against me he's against my family he's again and I'm just going to go back one more service and I'm going to and you walk in the door and brother Harvey stands there and he's got that smile and that handshake well we might as well preach and he says God bless you it's so good to see you tonight and brother Harvey gets up and testifies he said Church y'all pray for me he said y'all forgive me he said maybe I hadn't smiled like I had been I've been going through a bad trial he said but God just brought me a victory and the Holy Ghost and I I just want to apologize now it was nothing against you come on CH we forgot that leaders are humans have we forgot that our pastor is a man and the deacons are men and the musicians are are are you here are humans amen listen and sometime you're going to get offended but you got to squash the offenses by the word of God said listen you ain't got no fault coming you say well I do my own thinking no sir amen you ain't got you ain't no free thinker let the mind that was in Christ amen be in you if the mind that's in Christ be in you amen then the mind of Christ will keep the fire amen burning in the church when the devil's trying to put it out come on come on well can I preach come on the devil wants to put the fire out in this church and he will use anything anybody any problem any situation that he can to squash the fire what are you saying preacher I'm saying but you are here Amen to keep the fire burning in the face of every devil that's trying to put it out you say oh my sister oh my brother he said I'm not criticizing you I'm trying to tell you amen stop that little old formal way you're living and come into Christ and be anointed and go out and do something for him he said don't leave your church just make a real on fire Christian in your church that's what it is amen God will take care of the rest of it for you I'm just going to say what the Bible says the Bible says where there is no wood the fire goeth out so where there is no tail Bearer amen the strive ceaseth wo glory amen if you take the wood out of the fire the fire's going to go out amen and if you take the gossiper out the situation The Situation's going to lose its B and it's going to die out as the coals are to burning coals and wood to fire amen so is a contentious man amen to Kindle Strife can I say this when you lay a piece of wood on a fire amen it causes that fire to grow he said stop putting fire on the wood and it will dim out and go out and it just become smoke can I say this to you amen take the voice of the son of man out of the church church and it becomes a lukewarm Lodge which a gathering of a bunch of religious people I say to you tonight amen rebuke that lukewarm devil rebuke that contentious devil rebuke that devil that's trying to weasle his way into situations in the house of God and remember who you are you are the Church of the firstborn you are the Bride of Jesus Christ you have been called to rejoice in the spirit you are seeing things that eyes have lost to see you are hearing things that ears have longed to hear you are believing things that Hearts have long to deserve because God who is rich in Mercy has allowed you to receive the blessing of The Obedience of the word of [Music] God yes you say preacher you're getting way out there am I really it's imaginations come on imaginations will have you imagin everything possible come on come on come on Friends y'all know it's a truth we used to get a symptom and we'd pray about it we get a symptom we check Google and we plan our funeral you know why imaginations on imagination are you hearing me and imaginations will become real to you but the only are you hearing me now but the only one that has the ability to make it real is the devil that's right the only one that has the ability to make that imagination a reality is the devil what are you saying I'm saying God has chosen to reveal himself not to imagine himself to you God is Not imagining himself to you God is revealing himself the Bible says this he would reveal himself in three ways brother picks it up he said first time he revealed himself in a pillar of fire that was called the fatherhood then the same God made manifest in Jesus Christ which he built a body made this body he said but then thirdly amen through death that body he Sanctified a church that he can dwell in so it was God above us it was God With Us amen and it's God in us the same God let me say this God reveals himself in three ways God also reveals himself in three sons names he comes as the son of man which is a prophet he comes as the Son of God through the church ages he comes as the son of David in the millenum but between the second coming of our Lord and the lean Church age he prophesied he would come again as the son of man he said see watch he comes as son of man to fulfill the scripture but now he is to the church age he has been Son of God in the Millennium he'll be the son of David but between this time he is to reveal himself again amen as son of man a prophet amen now listen to this he said look because the word of the Lord comes to the prophets only yeah come on never to theologians it is to prophets and the Lord said he done nothing in his unchanging word he said we just talked about it at the end time then the Seven Seals that this Bible is sealed up the Sevenfold mysteries of all of Christ has to be revealed first and it can only be brought by a prophet so Jesus said amen that it shall be in the day when the son of man is revealed remember said what is revealed it is a secret made known a revelation is to reveal or make known a secret so there's something brother Jeff that's so powerful about this secret that when it's made known it's going to enable the church in the voice of the sign 1964 he said the son of man is prophesied to be revealed and what kind of a revelation will it be it'll be the revelation of his living after being crucified for 19900 years but but he is raised from the dead and is alive with us and he will be revealed can I say this we are living in the revealing of the son of man said this aren't you happy amen today to be living to see the son of man amen revealing himself to his church he said what does he reveal himself in Mercy saving your soul amen giving you of his life are y'all ready for this come on giving you Joy in the state of sadness giving you faith in the stad of fear giving you healing in the stad of sickness revealing himself to you in his Mercy amen the very same way that he did back there if he's doing that now then how far is the rapture away and judgment amen how many understands what I'm talking about amen it's the handwriting it's the revealing of the Lord Jesus so whatever is revealed Brother David is going to take away your sorrow and it's going to give you Joy whatever is revealed it's going to take away your going to take away your sickness and it's going to give you healing whatever is revealed is going to take away your fear and it's going to give you faith can I say this amen it was not a it was not the son of man revealing the son of man it was a son of man revealing the son of man Revelation 10:1 I saw another Mighty Angel amen come down from heaven on yeah he was clo with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire in Revelation 10:1 amen this Mighty Angel comes down amen but he comes down with a voice to impart to the Revelation 10:7 Angel without the Revelation 101 the voice of Revelation 107 has nothing to say has nothing to that's right come on Church remember said what he got me out here doing in these mountains waiting amen what was he doing he was lingering he was waiting he was waiting for something to come that would give him something to say he said I want you to be sure of this and you that listen to this tape you might have thought today I was trying to say that about myself being that I was packing the message I have no more to do with it than nothing I am no more than just a voice my voice even against my better judgment amen I wanted to be a Trapper but it's the will of my father that I declared to do I wasn't the one that appeared on the river I was only standing there when he appeared I'm not the one that performs these things and foretells these things as perfect as they are I'm only the one that's near when he does it are y'all ready for this I was only a voice that he used to say it it wasn't what I knew it's what I surrendered myself to that he spoke through it is isn't me it wasn't the seventh angel oh no it was the manifestation of the son of man Glory it wasn't the angel his message it was the mystery that God unfolded it's not a man it's God he said the angel was not the son of man he was the messenger from the son of man what are you saying preacher I'm saying the seventh angel is only the mouthpiece amen or the voice of the son of man therefore FRS is your brother that's all I am amen but God Amen God's gift is the spirit of God that come down in the form of an angel now he didn't have wings he looked like a man I heard him when he walked he said just as that walked on the floor walked right over just amen as normal as any man talks like any man he come time after time through the room and different places when I'm fasting and praying now tomorrow night he said I want to speak a little bit about this he said but when he comes it's different then hallelujah when he comes it's different then now he's here tonight to minister to you people I'm only his mouthpiece I'm only his mouthpiece what is a prophet amen a prophet is a mute until it speaks something but what I do is just yield myself to his Spirit listen and he speaks through it it cannot speak it's s are you with me it cannot speak itself look here the woman stands about 10 or 12T from me listen to this I'm just looking at her to talk to her cuz after preaching and so forth like the prophet did down there and I'm not a prophet but as the prophet did down there he had been balling that Gerome out and there so he just had to play and talk and Jesus talked to the woman but first he had to contact her spirit until he got anointed come on so it was the anointing that brought the angel of the Lord upon him that's right he said that's what I'm waiting for now are y'all ready for this to get the log of William brandom out of the way come on all right the log the log come on of William brandom come on now get my intellects my spirit my knowing whatever and I get that all out of the way so he can use use my eyes and my lips to glorify himself before his people can I say this to you if you fail to receive if you fail to believe if you fail to obey the messenger B said look he said you could be a renowned Christian or whatever and fail to believe what I've told you to be the truth listen you would never be able to reap a benefit from it he said I'm sorry to say that but it's the truth so when you receive and believe and Obey listen then it becomes and I'm tying this together then it becomes a voice of God to you yeah so it's no longer just a voice to Abraham or a voice to Moses or a voice to Noah it becomes a voice of God to you he said how did mup sha I never seen him in my life I know nothing of him how I know he was a congressman and who he was but the holy the Holy Spirit re it here at the platform see he revealed it amen makes his Secrets known now that's nothing to do with me see it just happened to be I was born for that purpose look I'm just your brother by the grace of God but when the angel of the Lord moves down it becomes then a voice of God to you if I offended you by saying that forgive me but I felt I felt it might have been resented amen but I am God's voice to you come on Church I am God's voice to you see I say that again that time was under inspiration see and I felt bad about it the first time amen but it repeated it so the first time he said it there was still a log of William brandom in the way that caused him to feel bad about saying I'm God's mouthpiece to you but in the matter of seconds because he was waiting on the angel of God the anointing which destroys the Yoke of the enemy in just a few seconds oh Church of the Living God Amen it wasn't a whole service later it wasn't a whole campaign later it was just a few seconds and William brandom's law got out of the way he got out of the way to believe that he was God's mouth what do you say it I'm saying church right now are you with me right now and then you're sitting there and the devil's trying to put something between you but something between your brother but something between you and the preacher but something between you and me or you and your husband or you and your wife are you with me amen and what he's trying to do is he's trying to block amen the blessing of God from coming into your heart but if you can so surrender to God if you can so surrender right now if you can say God I've been wrong God I'm sorry God I got out of line God I disobeyed God I got too much of my old human my old stinking sorry rotten human ability and knowledge and flesh in the way but right now God I want it to go I want my ambitions to go I want my selfishness to go I want that old religious spirit to go right I want it to go Lord come on now what he shows me I say it all right he the son of man is just using my voice oh yeah the devil don't mind you receive the voice he don't mind you believe the voice yeah just don't obey it y'all remember in St Luke Chapter 5 the Bible said that the son of man hath power to forgive and heal remember that you know what else the Bible said the Bible said there was a man laying there with py in a bed and Jesus saw his friend's faith and said man thy sins are forgiven thee in St Luke 5 and: 24 but that you may know that the son of man hath power upon Earth to forgive sins he said in the sick and py I say unto thee sit there and keep watered in your condition and keep going over the situation I say unto thee arise and take up thy couch and go into thine house come on church that devil had bound him outside of his own house and immediately he rose up before them and took up that where on he laid and departed into his own house glorifying God and they were all amazed and they all glorified God and were filled with fear amen saying we have seen strange things today look at this word strange it means unexpected it means uncommon it means incredible it means wonderful oh I say God Amen give us some strange things amen back in the house of God you know what I say I say it's become uncommon amen but it ought to become common again whatever the devil has taken away from you come on friends you know what I'm talking about the devil takes away your praise amen it become uncommon to see some people amen raise their hands it has become uncommon Amen to see some people back for word it has become uncommon to see some people sing a special it has become uncommon to see some people enjoy the blessings of the Holy Ghost but I say today in Word of Life Tabernacle The Voice voice of the son of man is alive and he's speaking and he's here and he's here to call you from the grave of whatever situation that's trying to hold you back yes sir Hallelujah all right watch that voice you know what that voice did are you with me you know what it did it separated the man from his past oh yeah thank you Lord Glory thank you Lord the power of the voice of the son of man when he said arise and take up thy bed when he spoke to him Brother David he separated him he separated him from the py come on church he he severed him amen from the condition that was causing him to lay in that bed he said listen man your pastor's behind you and hear is some instructions or he is some Commandments amen get up get up get up you mean me yes you get up rise up and walk into your future Hallelujah brother being the py wasn't in his future the py was in his past I love when you study the Miracles of the Bible how Jesus will look at him and say these words he'll say rise up oh yeah rise up yeah come on he don't say you're healed now just stay there and lay there and Waller and carry on Rise Up yes and walk walk look at this one take up thy bed you don't need it no more see what it is is the same voice that spoke in the Bible spoke in William brandom it was the voice of the word that's right come on Church look it up sha he heard the voice and 66 years in a wheelchair are you with me 66 years in a wheelchair come on right but when he heard the voice of the son of man said listen here's the secret that nobody knows here's the secret that I don't know but the son of man knows you were stacking hay in a hay barn and you fell as a child and you've been a for 66 years you've ran for president and you've lost you're a congressman you've got a certain color suit is that the truth he said yes sir bam said I washed him he said I washed him get up as he obeyed the voice of God listen his obedience brought him up out of the wheelchair said he ran up on the platform he jumped up and down and touched his toes you know why because the voice of the son of man that was able to forgive sin was also able to heal sicknesses yes [Applause] sir get up you say brother Andrew I've been hurt so it up sh but he still got up come on brother Joel how many meetings had me how many televangelist preachers had been around Upshaw and they said this is my claim to fame right here amen here's my chance tonight and they get up there oh glory to God hallelujah know everything

said oh here's another one of them amen here's another one that's going to try amen to get me up amen but this was a different one this was a different meeting this wasn't a preacher trying to build an ego or a reputation this was the son of man who had come down in the form of the seventh angel with some [Music] [Applause] instructions I tell you what amen Upshaw never let all his offenes stop him from believing there was a real come on church he never let all those guessers sister Patty he never let all those televangelists said he said many had tried Amen to get him up amen but he never let those offenes become can that would block him from the time and it was time to walk he said I know there's been some fakes and I know there's been some Hypocrites but God if there's been this many there's got to be a real somewhere there's got to be a real somewhere and he said in a meeting one night and he said rise up and walk amen you know what he done he said rise up amen rise up and walk you know what up Shaw didn't do he didn't say well I guess I'll try it again well let's see if this is right no he a spirit of obedience through all the hurts he had been through come on I know what that devil does Amen that devil gets you so tied down by hurts and this preacher let you down and this Deacon done this and this church done that and this done that and nine times out of 10 amen it's nothing but misunderstandings come on it's misunderstandings amen but the house of God is not a place for every foul and hateful bird it's not a cage for every spirit it's a place for the liberty of
