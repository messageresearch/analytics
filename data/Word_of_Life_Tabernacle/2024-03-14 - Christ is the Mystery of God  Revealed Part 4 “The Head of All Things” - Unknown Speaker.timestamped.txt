[0:00] see the same thing he's got you on today
[0:03] see see you act any way you want to
[0:07] you're free moral agan so therefore if
[0:09] he put the first like that he has to put
[0:11] the second like that he has to put
[0:12] everyone like that or he acted wrong in
[0:14] the first
[0:15] place amen but everybody is on that same
[0:18] basis now noticing and bringing that
[0:22] back and letting that man do that and
[0:24] knowing that he would do it nobody he
[0:27] would do it but what did it do it
[0:28] displayed his rute as
[0:31] Savior and the whole purpose then is
[0:33] left in Jesus
[0:35] Christ to become God himself to take the
[0:38] penalty of his own
[0:40] law death to die to redeem the wife that
[0:44] was lost by rejecting him when Eve went
[0:47] away from the word she went away from
[0:49] her mate and when the church goes away
[0:51] from the word to a denomination she
[0:54] rejects and commits
[0:56] fornications with the world of man's
[0:59] Wisdom
[1:00] rejecting the authority of God's
[1:04] word that sound
[1:06] clear the Bible said committing
[1:09] spiritual
[1:11] fornications any word in the Bible
[1:13] That's rejected or any self
[1:16] interpretation put to it is absolutely
[1:19] rejecting and committing adultery
[1:22] against the god that is your
[1:25] husband and adulterous never enters the
[1:28] kingdom of heaven we know that now see
[1:31] that's what Eve done at the first
[1:33] place now notice again now what's his
[1:36] threefold purpose manifest himself in
[1:38] Jesus Christ to come into the body by
[1:41] Jesus Christ to have the prises to what
[1:43] restore back
[1:46] Eden bring back that which lost that's
[1:49] the only thing out of order all the rest
[1:52] of his things was in order but he had to
[1:54] let put man on free moreal agency to
[1:56] fall so that he might be a ior to
[2:00] display what's in him see his attribute
[2:03] of Savior something had to be lost and
[2:06] the very thing that man fell and become
[2:09] lost he become the savior of that taking
[2:11] his own law and he could not do it is
[2:14] that great Jehovah that covered all
[2:16] space time see he could do it and he had
[2:18] to become a man and he took kinship with
[2:20] the man that was lost amen and become a
[2:24] man God made flesh
[2:27] Hallelujah I think I'm excited about
[2:31] not something
[2:34] inside
[2:36] God became from God to become me to take
[2:41] my sin upon him that he might make me
[2:44] him amen back to his great purpose of
[2:48] Sons and Daughters of God for he is a
[2:50] Eternal
[2:52] Father that attribute was in
[2:55] him see so that had to be displayed now
[2:59] see the whole threefold purpose see to
[3:03] express himself he wants to
[3:06] become the the world is lost now he has
[3:10] to express himself in a
[3:12] man to become a savior through the
[3:15] reconciliation of the blood from his
[3:18] cross now he had to become that to die
[3:22] in order to save and to bring yourself
[3:26] back into the church to have the pences
[3:29] in church now remember it cannot and
[3:33] will not and never will be and never has
[3:36] been a denomination

[35:44] so uh we want to talk about chrisis the
[35:46] mystery of God revealed again I I want
[35:48] to welcome um I want to welcome my

[36:17] children so we're we're glad to have her
[36:20] living up here closer where she can come
[36:21] to church more often amen John Chap
[36:25] 1:3 and then we'll go to Ephesians 1 and
[36:28] Colossians 1 says all things someone say
[36:33] all things were made by him and without
[36:37] him was not anything made that was made
[36:42] Ephesians
[36:45] 1:22 says and hath
[36:48] put there it is again all things under
[36:52] his feet so all things were made by him
[36:56] all things are under his feet and gave
[36:59] him to be the head
[37:01] over all things to the church and he is
[37:06] the head of the body the church who is
[37:10] the beginning this Colossians
[37:13] 1:18 I just went right into the next
[37:15] verse Colossians 1:18 he is the head of
[37:17] the body the church who is the beginning
[37:20] the firstborn from the dead that in all
[37:23] things he might have the preeminence
[37:26] pray the Lord with Daddy's bless lening
[37:27] to the word you may be
[37:30] seated I think it's pretty clear that
[37:32] the Bible teaches that he made all
[37:34] things that all things are under his
[37:37] feet and that he is the head of all
[37:41] things and in all things he wants to
[37:44] have the
[37:45] preeminence I I want to I want us to
[37:48] understand tonight that if he's the head
[37:50] that means he's the
[37:52] boss right that's what that means he's
[37:54] the boss he's he's not a middleman
[37:57] manager he's not he don't have to ask
[38:00] anybody he don't have to get my
[38:01] permission or your permission all things
[38:05] are under his feet oh and I'm so glad of
[38:08] that today because that means that the
[38:10] devil even has to ask him permission
[38:12] before he can come at me before he can
[38:15] come at you the devil actually has to
[38:17] get permission to come at you I want to
[38:19] say I want to say tonight we he he is
[38:22] over all things and that means he's over
[38:24] cancer he's over diabetes he's over
[38:27] every every symptom that would come in
[38:29] our body he's over all
[38:32] things oh that's what that's what we
[38:34] understood by Christ is the mystery of
[38:37] God revealed that he is the preeminent
[38:39] he has the preeminence he is over all
[38:43] things so brother B says since we think
[38:46] this now this is important since we
[38:49] think this since he has been made the
[38:52] head of all things to us Oh my he is the
[38:56] head of all things to us he said which
[38:59] we are considered all things so we're
[39:03] part of that right yes sir you say now
[39:06] now here it's where we talked some about
[39:09] this Sunday sometimes we look at the
[39:11] world and the way that it is we look at
[39:13] people and see how could they get by
[39:15] with that well he's the head of the cner
[39:17] too yeah that's what the Bible teaches
[39:20] he if he was the if he's the head of all
[39:22] things what about the sinner he was made
[39:25] to be the judge of The Sinner if he
[39:27] don't accept it he was made the glory
[39:30] for the believer who does accept it so
[39:33] there thing he said all things again I
[39:36] want you to say it all things that's
[39:39] everything it's not everything except
[39:41] for the big stuff it's not everything
[39:43] except for some stuff it's not
[39:45] everything except for the thing which I
[39:47] think went wrong or where I didn't get
[39:49] my way but all things in all things he
[39:53] has the fre in all things he is the head
[39:57] he man and so we got to trust him
[39:58] tonight church we got to believe him
[40:00] that he knows what he's doing and he
[40:02] knows more about us than we know about
[40:04] ourselves yes so in all things he has
[40:08] the preeminence now look in in 2 Timothy
[40:12] 2:20 I want you to to get this about
[40:14] because he's over all things and yet
[40:17] there's good and bad that that that
[40:19] benefit from his Mercy yeah the bad
[40:22] benefit the good benefit sir but yet
[40:25] he's the head of all things he'll he'll
[40:27] deal with them in his time but but he's
[40:30] over all things now look in 2 Timothy
[40:32] 2:20 but in a great house there are not
[40:35] only vessels of gold and of silver but
[40:37] also of wood and of Earth some to honor
[40:40] and some to
[40:42] dishonor and so we realized then in a
[40:45] great house he's the head of all things
[40:47] he's the king of
[40:49] everything and so but in his great house
[40:52] there's some that are vessels of Honor
[40:54] some that are vessels of Dishonor
[40:56] brother Brandon went to a meeting among
[40:59] the Pentecostals when he first met the
[41:00] Pentecostal people and I look at our
[41:02] kids you know going to youth camp you
[41:04] know it's it's kind of like that you're
[41:05] getting in that atmosphere almost an
[41:07] extreme atmosphere of worship and and
[41:10] praise and it just does something to you
[41:12] uh you know we ought to have services
[41:14] like that here and I believe we do but
[41:17] but it just seemed like everybody's
[41:18] gathered together for one purpose and
[41:20] and yet there's evil present yeah people
[41:23] get sick things happen and and there's
[41:25] leav in the loaf if we can say it that
[41:27] way there there there's kids that don't
[41:29] act right and not everybody that says
[41:31] they're a message believer is a message
[41:33] believer not everybody that says there
[41:35] Christian lives it there's always evil
[41:37] present Paul said whenever I would do
[41:39] good there's evil present and yet we've
[41:41] been called to be something different
[41:44] than the evil and and so brother Brandon
[41:46] meets those Pentecostals and he he sees
[41:49] that that there's one that's spoke in
[41:51] tongues and one that interpreted and one
[41:53] of them was a real Christian and the
[41:55] other one was uh was a charlatan was
[41:57] living with somebody else's wife and how
[41:59] could they both be anointed and so he
[42:01] read the he the Lord showed him Hebrews
[42:04] chapter 6 and verse 7 for the Earth
[42:06] which drinketh in the rain that cometh
[42:08] off upon it and bringeth forth herbs
[42:10] meat for them by whom it is dressed
[42:12] receiveth blessing from God all things
[42:14] it all does right but he but that which
[42:17] beareth thorns and briers is rejected
[42:20] and is nigh into cursing whose end is to
[42:22] be burned now look all things receive
[42:26] the Rin but only the the seed becomes
[42:30] the wheat that he wants us to be there
[42:32] had to be something inside of us so
[42:34] there's always going to be something
[42:35] there but I'll say this for us that we
[42:38] should be a a standard of God's mercy we
[42:41] should be a standard of God's grace but
[42:42] the brandom calls us God's insign and
[42:45] insign is kind of an old word but it
[42:47] means a flag or a standard we are the
[42:50] standard that's right we are God's
[42:52] standard in the Earth today brother
[42:54] Brandon says we are God's ins signs to
[42:56] the world he said that's the reason I'm
[42:58] always scolding the Pentecostal Church
[42:59] getting after them he said their ways of
[43:01] living that's the reason the world can't
[43:03] see Christ cuz we let down the bars we
[43:04] get away from that see you can't control
[43:06] what somebody else does but you got to
[43:07] be an ins sign yourself let's be the
[43:09] standard let's be the banner let's do
[43:12] that ourselves let's let's become that
[43:14] yeah amen and so he says when our women
[43:17] dressed and act like act like the rest
[43:19] of the world when our men go out and
[43:20] dirty jokes and smoke and carry on like
[43:22] the rest of them married five four or
[43:24] five times everything else plls get them
[43:26] into church what he means not that a
[43:27] person couldn't be saved in that
[43:29] condition but people are pulling them in
[43:30] giv promising them things and and trying
[43:33] to get them in the church and they don't
[43:35] change they they they never they never
[43:37] become any different they're just like
[43:39] they always were he said why no he said
[43:41] the world don't believe you've got it he
[43:43] said let me tell you brother when you're
[43:45] dead and your life is hid in Christ
[43:47] through God and sealed by the Holy Ghost
[43:49] and God lifts you up in Heavenly places
[43:51] you'll be an ins sign that the work of
[43:52] God has been committed in you oh I trust
[43:54] you that have received the baptism of
[43:56] the Holy Ghost you're an inside today
[43:59] sir you're a standard you're a
[44:01] banner of God's love to the world
[44:05] amen
[44:06] amen amen I believe our young people
[44:09] were that over the weekend let's be that
[44:10] every day of the week wherever we go
[44:13] whatever we do whatever we do the rest
[44:15] of our lives look Paul Paul says beloved
[44:18] we are persuaded better things of you
[44:20] yeah things that accompany salvation
[44:23] better than than the tears we're we're
[44:25] persuaded that you're wheat your God's
[44:27] seed now look brand said it takes the
[44:30] night we're going back to crisis the
[44:31] mystery of God
[44:33] revealed it takes the night to express
[44:35] the glory of the day it takes the vessel
[44:37] of Dishonor to express the love and care
[44:40] for the vessel of the honored it takes
[44:42] an evil woman that would wear immoral
[44:43] clothes and sell her morals to express
[44:45] the virtue of a decent genuine lady it
[44:48] takes a crook and a thief and a man to
[44:50] express the genuiness of a real believer
[44:53] a real Christian it takes the hypocrite
[44:55] to show up the believer what he is so
[44:58] that's why in the house there's some
[45:00] vessels of honor and some vessels of
[45:02] Dishonor because you wouldn't know what
[45:03] the vessels of Honor were without the
[45:06] vessels of
[45:07] Dishonor right so there's got to be
[45:09] somebody that that tells a lie so
[45:11] somebody else can tell the truth there's
[45:13] got to be somebody who gives in so
[45:15] there'll be somebody who won't give in
[45:18] and who live it every moment amen heyen
[45:21] so all things was made by him and
[45:24] brother Rand said since he was made all
[45:27] things made for all of us he said all
[45:30] things were made by for by him he said
[45:33] then since that is true we should make
[45:35] our identification should be with him we
[45:39] should be identified ourselves with him
[45:43] because he has identified himself with
[45:46] us yeah that's what the baptism of the
[45:48] Holy Ghost is it's God identifying
[45:51] himself with you it's God sealing your
[45:53] faith accepting your faith and so he has
[45:56] identified himself with you so we should
[45:58] be identified with him he said how by
[46:01] living for him amen do you love him
[46:04] tonight by living for him not just a
[46:07] confession now this this is you this
[46:10] isn't very deep brother Ben well it's
[46:12] good anyhow and it's actually just about
[46:14] as deep as you can get because you can't
[46:16] get anything more uh more deeper really
[46:20] than Christ in you you can't really get
[46:22] anything deeper than the mystery of God
[46:24] in flesh yeah right so he said he said
[46:28] you're uh so many people takes a
[46:30] confession and say I got he's got to
[46:32] this place now are you a Christian I'm
[46:34] Methodist he said well that's a long
[46:36] ways from making yourself known as a
[46:38] Christian he said well now now watch
[46:41] because now if you identify yourself as
[46:42] a Methodist you're identifying yourself
[46:44] with whatever the Methodist Church is
[46:47] yeah right so everything the Methodist
[46:50] do is what you do well look what the
[46:51] Methodist does right right I'm Baptist
[46:55] well look what the Baptist does
[46:57] I'm Catholic look what they do I want
[46:59] you to understand today that your
[47:01] primary identification is not as Word of
[47:04] Life Tabernacle right right because look
[47:07] what they do right yall are good people
[47:10] you understand but but but then you you
[47:12] have to identify with every other person
[47:14] that says they're from Word of Life
[47:15] Tabernacle it is an identification but
[47:18] it's not our primary identification
[47:20] right your primary identification is not
[47:23] well I listen to brother Ben PR he's my
[47:24] pastor that's not your primary identific
[47:27] we thank God for that but that's not
[47:29] what how we identify ourselves we don't
[47:31] identify ourselves even by by saying
[47:33] well I believe the message yeah right
[47:36] right we don't identify ourselves well I
[47:38] believe in a prophet that's not how we
[47:40] identify ourselves as Christians yeah we
[47:43] identify with Christ because he never
[47:45] did anything wrong right oh church we
[47:48] can only understand that listen in every
[47:50] group there's going to be good and bad
[47:52] there's going to be there's going to be
[47:53] right and wrong but we identify
[47:55] ourselves as Christian Christians amen
[47:58] because we know he never did anything
[48:01] wrong so they they say I'm Catholic I'm
[48:04] Methodist he said look what they do said
[48:06] but the only way you can actually be a
[48:08] Christian is for Christ to identify
[48:11] himself in
[48:13] you right he said how we got a he said a
[48:16] stinger there he said I hope everybody
[48:17] on the tape gets that too you say I'm
[48:20] Pentecostal that don't mean a thing he
[48:22] said it's Christ identified in you
[48:26] that's when we'll know he said that's
[48:29] when he has recognized you you say I
[48:31] spoke with tongues Devils does too I
[48:34] shouted the muhammadans Buddhist
[48:36] everything shouts Indians scream at the
[48:38] snake dance sure they all do colts Clans
[48:40] everything else screaming holler holler
[48:42] and shouted a baseball game but when
[48:44] Christ is identified in you identifying
[48:46] himself then you are Christlike which
[48:48] the word Christian means to be
[48:50] Christlike there is your identification
[48:53] all right he said now and since he is
[48:54] our identification we should be
[48:56] identified with him by living for him
[48:59] that's how you identify you don't
[49:01] identify by even how we worship because
[49:03] we worship a lot like the Pentecostal
[49:05] Church
[49:06] worships you know why let me explain
[49:09] that you know why we identify more
[49:11] Pentecostal style of worship because the
[49:13] shuck was the closest thing to the
[49:15] wheat right so if you've got something
[49:18] if if you got real wheat it's not going
[49:20] to look very much like the
[49:21] stalk it's not going to look very much
[49:24] like the tassel but it's going to look a
[49:25] lot like the shut right but the shuck is
[49:28] not the wheat but yet the wheat and and
[49:31] and things that we do many things we do
[49:33] are going to look like Pentecostal but
[49:34] that's not how we identify ourselves we
[49:37] identify ourselves as as Christians he's
[49:40] living in us then we should be
[49:42] identified with him by living for him
[49:45] amen that's how we get our
[49:47] identification it's not about even our
[49:49] worship though that's good and we ought
[49:50] to worship him with all of our hearts
[49:52] listen Church he's done so much for us
[49:54] we ought to worship him every moment of
[49:55] the day every day of the week every hour
[49:58] of the day it ought to be our constant
[50:00] our constant thought our constant praise
[50:02] ought to be towards him listen to me
[50:04] young people don't let the devil steal
[50:05] away from you that that that that
[50:07] worship that God gave you don't let him
[50:09] steal away from you you worship God on I
[50:12] don't care what anybody else says
[50:14] worship God trust God live for God walk
[50:18] with God but but but our worship is not
[50:21] how we're identified we're identified by
[50:23] living for him God's now we're going to
[50:27] get where brother Brandon begins to get
[50:28] into the meat of his sermon now he
[50:30] begins to deal with God's three-fold
[50:32] purpose he said notice God has has had a
[50:35] three-fold purpose in this great mystery
[50:38] secret God in his great mystery secret
[50:41] that he had before the world began he's
[50:43] got a three-fold purpose in it he said
[50:46] now what we want to go upon this morning
[50:47] is what is that three-fold purpose he
[50:49] said and I believe by the help of God
[50:51] who is present I love that he just
[50:54] casually throws that in but the help of
[50:57] God who is present he'll show it to us
[50:59] yeah Oh my he said that was my my
[51:02] Ministry to to say he's here yeah he
[51:05] said now if he had this three-fold
[51:06] purpose we want to find out what is this
[51:09] three-fold purpose now I know some of
[51:10] y'all like brother Ben this is so
[51:11] Elementary well the kid your kids aren't
[51:13] born knowing this
[51:15] stuff and every one of us needs to be
[51:18] reminded of it from time to
[51:20] time so he had a three-fold purpose now
[51:23] we're taking a big view of all of time
[51:25] his entire Plan of Redemption a
[51:28] threefold purpose he said the first
[51:29] thing was that God wanted to reveal
[51:32] himself to the people he wanted to
[51:35] reveal himself to the people he couldn't
[51:37] do it as great Jehovah God who covered
[51:40] all space Time and Eternity yeah oh
[51:43] there's so many lessons in that
[51:44] church it just Thrills my heart to know
[51:47] he couldn't do it as great Jehovah God
[51:49] because he's too
[51:51] great so we look for big things many
[51:53] times and and that's not how he
[51:55] necessarily reveals to himself he
[51:57] doesn't just reveal himself in big
[51:58] things but he reveals himself in
[52:01] humility God oh my he hides himself in
[52:05] Simplicity reveals himself in
[52:07] humility now look he couldn't do it as a
[52:10] great Jehovah he's too great to ever be
[52:12] revealed to people because it would be
[52:14] too
[52:15] mysterious how could that great being
[52:17] that never did begin that after you went
[52:19] beyond the cycle of hundreds of billions
[52:21] and trillions and trillions of years of
[52:23] light space on out into the infant into
[52:25] the eternity eternity and a great
[52:27] creature that was all that and still is
[52:30] but what he he wanted to do he said he
[52:32] loved fatherhood yes for he was a father
[52:36] and the only way that he could express
[52:37] it was to become a son a man now this is
[52:41] important now he said that's the reason
[52:44] Jesus kept saying the son of man the son
[52:48] of man is just God in
[52:49] flesh right that's why we believe that
[52:52] the son of man revealed himself in our
[52:54] day revealed himself through a prophet
[52:56] but now he's revealing himself in the
[52:58] bride and you can to find quote after
[53:00] quote after quote that's that way it
[53:02] wasn't just in a prophet in Malachi 4
[53:04] but it was also to be revealed in the
[53:06] bride at the last day he had to come in
[53:08] flesh
[53:09] again I hope you're hear me today he had
[53:11] to come in flesh again that's the age
[53:13] we're living in we're not living in a
[53:15] time of of of milk we're not living in a
[53:18] time of just justification or
[53:19] sanctification or even just the the
[53:21] baptism of the Holy Ghost or the fruits
[53:23] of the spirit but he's we're actually
[53:25] living or the gifts of the Spirit we're
[53:26] living in the time of the fullness of
[53:29] the manifestation of Christ and I said
[53:31] Lord live in me every moment be make my
[53:35] flesh your flesh make my feet your feet
[53:37] make my hands your
[53:39] hands that's the hour that we're living
[53:41] in we're not living in a time where you
[53:43] only worship God in church we're living
[53:45] in a time where you worship God on
[53:46] Sunday and on Monday and on Tuesday and
[53:48] on Wednesday and all through the week
[53:49] you worship Him in your job you worship
[53:52] him at school you worship oh the world
[53:54] don't understand it and they can't live
[53:56] it but you can live it why because you
[53:58] he has come inside of you to live it
[54:01] that's right it's God in
[54:04] flesh you say well if God was in my
[54:07] flesh it'd do a whole lot more
[54:10] miraculous things well that's what they
[54:11] said about
[54:15] him if God was in my flesh there'd be a
[54:17] lot of people talking about it would
[54:19] know about it and the world would be
[54:20] that's what they said about
[54:24] him maybe you don't even
[54:28] recognize oh church we could just
[54:30] understand it today we'd realize that we
[54:33] have the authority to speak to whatever
[54:34] is going on in our lives and get rid of
[54:37] it yes and send it out because we we
[54:40] have a right to to the to the promises
[54:42] of God to all the promises of God why
[54:45] the son of
[54:46] man the son of man it's Christ in you
[54:49] the hope of glory he said that's the
[54:51] reason Jesus kept saying the son of man
[54:53] now watch Hebrews 21:14 backs this up he
[54:55] said for his much then as the children
[54:58] are partakers of Flesh and Blood he also
[55:01] himself likewise took part of the same
[55:05] that through death he might destroy him
[55:09] that had the power of death that is the
[55:11] devil so he had to become a partaker of
[55:14] Flesh and Blood a son of man now he said
[55:18] see they didn't know what he was talking
[55:19] about many of them but now you get it he
[55:21] said see he wanted to express
[55:24] himself that was one of his great three
[55:26] fold purposes was to express himself
[55:28] identify himself with human
[55:33] beings see Jason he wants to identify
[55:36] himself with you even as a young man man
[55:40] he wants to identify himself Jaden he
[55:42] wants to identify himself with young men
[55:45] so he became a young
[55:47] man right and so he not only wanted to
[55:50] live in a flesh body but he wants to
[55:52] live in your flesh
[55:54] body right he he he know only went to
[55:56] church in his body he wants to go to
[55:58] church in your body he not only healed
[56:01] the sick in his body he wants to heal
[56:03] the sick in your body he not only cast
[56:05] out devils in his body but he wants to
[56:07] cast out devils in your body are you
[56:10] hearing me tonight he he wants to borrow
[56:12] your body amen that's what the son of
[56:14] man is that's what we've been shown that
[56:16] God would do that in our hour right Amen
[56:20] to identify himself with human beings
[56:23] but so the second fold the first fold is
[56:25] God above us yeah and or or he was God
[56:28] above us and then and then he come down
[56:30] the first fold of unveiling himself is
[56:32] Christ right he's expressing himself and
[56:35] then secondly God in us the son of man
[56:38] but not the son of man in one body but
[56:40] the son of man in a many membered body
[56:43] right at the end time now watch and to
[56:45] do that now brother brand taught us he
[56:48] become a Son of God through the church
[56:49] ages at the end he would be revealed for
[56:51] a short time as son of man again because
[56:54] the Gentiles had to see was had to have
[56:56] the opportunity the Jews had right
[56:59] before the coming of the Lord now so
[57:02] that is that is his great three-fold
[57:03] purpose was to express himself so we get
[57:06] it the first one is
[57:07] Christ right second is to have
[57:10] preeminence in his body of Believers
[57:13] that is his bride that he might live in
[57:17] people yes that's pretty simple isn't it
[57:20] he might live in brother Joe right
[57:23] sister Joanna he might live in people
[57:26] right he he might live in you say well
[57:28] brother Ben that's hard for me to see
[57:29] but that's because of the veil of flesh
[57:31] but he wants to live in you right see
[57:34] Colossians 1:27 he said to whom God
[57:37] would make known what is the riches of
[57:38] the glory of this mystery among the
[57:40] Gentiles he wants to make this known
[57:42] which is Christ in you the hope of glory
[57:45] why did he give you the baptism of the
[57:46] Holy Ghost he wants to live in
[57:48] youen are you with me so
[57:51] far he said now he could do that in Adam
[57:53] and Eve but sin SE ated them so now
[57:56] there had to be some way to get it back
[57:58] again he said oh my this is Rich to me
[58:01] just to even think of it see what God's
[58:04] purpose was now why didn't he just keep
[58:07] Adam and Eve like that here's a here's a
[58:09] good question why did he why didn't he
[58:12] just keep them like that and that
[58:13] implies he had the power to keep them
[58:15] like
[58:16] that right he could have just he could
[58:19] have just knocked the old serpent in the
[58:20] head and send him on down the
[58:23] road right he could have just he knew
[58:26] what was going on right right he could
[58:28] have just stopped it but he didn't stop
[58:30] it why he had a purpose yes he he could
[58:33] have just done that many times in our
[58:35] lives he could have just taken care of
[58:36] it but he let us go through it but he
[58:39] said I'll never leave you I'll never
[58:41] forsake you I'll always be with you amen
[58:45] but but he lets us go through it why he
[58:47] wants to express himself right
[58:49] Hallelujah so he expresses himself in
[58:52] his attributes now watch that was his
[58:55] purpose he said he he would never have
[58:57] been able to express his fullness his
[58:59] full attribute because he could have
[59:01] been a father there that's true but also
[59:03] he's a
[59:05] savior oh I'm so glad for that attribute
[59:07] of Salvation I'm so glad he came down
[59:10] and and became a savior to me so he had
[59:13] to in order to do that he had to become
[59:15] a son right he said he would never been
[59:17] able to express his fullness but he's a
[59:19] savior he said you say how do you know
[59:21] he was he is cuz I've had the
[59:25] experience he is a savior and he had to
[59:28] express that how could he do it only
[59:30] through Christ how could he be a son
[59:32] only through Christ how could he be a
[59:34] Healer only through Christ you see what
[59:36] brother R's elevating here he's not
[59:38] elevating a certain Church he's not
[59:40] elevating a certain Ministry he's not
[59:42] even elevating himself but he's pointing
[59:44] to the Lamb of God and he's saying how
[59:46] can he be a son only through Christ how
[59:48] can he be a Healer only through
[59:50] Christ all things are wound up in that
[59:53] one person Jesus that he got him for the
[59:55] bill you've got
[59:57] everything you got nothing to worry
[59:59] about young people you got nothing to
[1:00:00] worry about mama when you're worried
[1:00:02] about your little children you got
[1:00:03] nothing to worry about fathers you got
[1:00:05] nothing to worry about as you get older
[1:00:07] why because you got him he's in your
[1:00:10] boat you got nothing to worry
[1:00:13] about Hallelujah all things are wound up
[1:00:16] in that one person so if you have him
[1:00:18] you have life if you have him you got
[1:00:22] everything oh that just makes you want
[1:00:24] to stop and worship for a while if you
[1:00:26] got him you got enough to make it
[1:00:30] through
[1:00:31] Hallelujah he said when I think of it I
[1:00:33] just see denominations pass off the
[1:00:35] scene why because they're trying to put
[1:00:37] something between you and him a headship
[1:00:40] between you and him but but there's not
[1:00:43] nothing between you and him because
[1:00:44] there's one mediator between God and man
[1:00:46] the man Christ Jesus are you with me now
[1:00:51] you become man to be that
[1:00:53] mediator and watch he said when I see
[1:00:55] God 's great purpose revealing himself
[1:00:57] and first to reveal himself in Christ
[1:01:00] the fullness of the godhead bodily and
[1:01:02] then to bring that fullness of godhead
[1:01:03] bodily into a
[1:01:06] people powerful
[1:01:09] stuff it's not easy stuff he could bring
[1:01:12] the fullness of godhead bodily into a
[1:01:15] people and the listen to me the the
[1:01:18] biggest thing the the greatest battle of
[1:01:21] your life is going to be wrestling with
[1:01:24] the thought sir that a man could have a
[1:01:28] Divine
[1:01:29] attribute on the inside brother BR said
[1:01:31] the hardest thing he can do is get one
[1:01:33] human being to believe
[1:01:35] another listen to me Church the biggest
[1:01:39] battle you'll ever face is trying to get
[1:01:41] you to believe you
[1:01:45] on to get to the point where you you
[1:01:48] know I know I'm going to make it I know
[1:01:52] it's going to be okay I know Christ
[1:01:53] dwells in me because you're always
[1:01:55] looking at what you do wrong you're
[1:01:57] always looking at the outside you're
[1:01:59] always looking at the attributes of sin
[1:02:01] but we know that there's a God who's
[1:02:03] brought us up over all of that he's
[1:02:05] brought us up above all those things do
[1:02:07] you believe it tonight how many of you
[1:02:09] believe it tonight you you you know he's
[1:02:11] brought you up there's something inside
[1:02:13] of you greater than you he that is in
[1:02:15] you is greater than he that is in the
[1:02:16] world come on you got to wrestle with
[1:02:20] that with the thought of divinity in
[1:02:24] flesh that's what's hard for people to
[1:02:26] see they can't see Christ brother Wes
[1:02:28] because Christ came in a baby form in a
[1:02:32] Manger in a helpless form yet he was God
[1:02:36] in flesh yeah and they can't see you
[1:02:38] can't see yourself because you come in a
[1:02:42] way that you you think well I I just
[1:02:44] couldn't be that but by his grace you
[1:02:46] are right by his blood you are right you
[1:02:49] said well he never made a mistake I made
[1:02:51] mistakes but he died for you took your
[1:02:53] penalty so that you could be free
[1:02:56] so he could come and have the
[1:02:58] preeminence over your
[1:03:00] life and and that's a that's a heavy
[1:03:02] thought preeminence is a heavy thought
[1:03:05] it's hard to wrestle with he wants
[1:03:08] preeminence over your
[1:03:09] emotions preeminence over your life
[1:03:11] preeminence over your job preeminence
[1:03:13] over your family not the preacher him
[1:03:16] yes right not the church him not
[1:03:19] denomination him he wants preeminence
[1:03:22] and he is the word right he said then to
[1:03:25] bring that full of godhead bodily into a
[1:03:27] people that he could have the premise to
[1:03:29] oversight the leading and brother
[1:03:30] brandham talks about the prisoner of
[1:03:31] Jesus Christ and he just preached that
[1:03:34] sermon he talks about that he said
[1:03:35] another one he said if you didn't get
[1:03:37] the tape he said I preach on a prisoner
[1:03:38] of Jesus Christ Paul a prisoner he said
[1:03:41] when God gets you to be his prisoner you
[1:03:43] can't do nothing but what the spirit
[1:03:44] says do Paul was all this great
[1:03:47] intellect he was taught by Gia to be a
[1:03:49] great priest to Rabbi someday and he had
[1:03:51] high Ambitions he was intellectually a
[1:03:53] great man great Authority great man in
[1:03:55] the nation
[1:03:56] but he had to sacrifice every bit of it
[1:03:59] to become part of the word to express
[1:04:01] Jesus Christ oh I hope we can see it
[1:04:04] tonight he had a notion to go over
[1:04:06] someplace some brother had called him
[1:04:07] but he was forbidden by the spirit yeah
[1:04:10] to do his own
[1:04:11] will look at acts 16 we can find that in
[1:04:14] the scripture how many believe the
[1:04:16] prophet was a word Prophet so everything
[1:04:18] we always tie it back to the scripture
[1:04:20] and show what brother Brandon was
[1:04:21] talking about when he says these things
[1:04:23] acts 16:4 as they went through the
[1:04:26] cities they delivered them the decrees
[1:04:27] for the keep that ordained to the
[1:04:29] apostles and Elders which are at
[1:04:30] Jerusalem we still keep those things
[1:04:33] today at verse five so were the churches
[1:04:35] established in the faith and increased
[1:04:37] in number daily I love that verse six
[1:04:39] now when they had gone throughout fgia
[1:04:41] and the region of galatia were forbidden
[1:04:43] of the Holy Spirit to preach the word in
[1:04:46] Asia you said why would they be
[1:04:48] forbidden to preach the word in a
[1:04:49] certain place everything you do just
[1:04:52] because you're busy doesn't mean you're
[1:04:53] busy in the way God wants you to to
[1:04:56] be that's a good lesson for all of
[1:04:59] us right we we got to be busy doing what
[1:05:01] he wants us to
[1:05:03] do right so it's it was his will for
[1:05:05] them to preach because he called them to
[1:05:07] preach but he don't always want you to
[1:05:09] preach in the place you want to preach
[1:05:11] sometimes he calls you somewhere else
[1:05:13] it's his will for you uh if you're a
[1:05:15] housewife it's his will for you to do
[1:05:17] certain things if you're a uh uh uh say
[1:05:20] a worker it's his will for you to do
[1:05:21] certain things but maybe not in the
[1:05:22] place that you're in so you got to
[1:05:24] follow his will now just being busy is
[1:05:27] not always the will of God act 16:7
[1:05:29] after they were come to Mah they Sav to
[1:05:31] go into bythnia but the spirit suffered
[1:05:34] them
[1:05:34] not now if the spirit forbids something
[1:05:39] it's because there's something else you
[1:05:41] should be
[1:05:41] doing right he doesn't forbid something
[1:05:44] just to make you lazy yeah but he
[1:05:46] forbids you doing this because there's
[1:05:47] something else you need to do right
[1:05:49] verse eight they passing by MAA come
[1:05:51] down to trass and a vision appeared to
[1:05:53] Paul in the night there stood a man of
[1:05:55] Macedon and prayed him saying come over
[1:05:56] into Macedonia and help us well I love
[1:05:59] that what is it he he couldn't have gone
[1:06:01] into Macedonia and helped the man in the
[1:06:03] vision if he had gone down into
[1:06:06] Asia right so God had something better
[1:06:08] for him he's always got something better
[1:06:10] if he closed this one door he's always
[1:06:12] someone say always he's always got
[1:06:14] something better brother Ben how can you
[1:06:16] say that because he's head of how many
[1:06:19] things how many
[1:06:21] things if he's head of all things right
[1:06:23] come on now y going to think you're in a
[1:06:26] Sunday school class tonight but listen
[1:06:28] that's what he is right he's the Supreme
[1:06:31] he's the head of all things he has
[1:06:34] preeminence in the body right and so
[1:06:36] where he wants you to go he'll open the
[1:06:39] door where he wants you to not go he'll
[1:06:40] close the
[1:06:41] door Hallelujah said and after you'd
[1:06:45] seen the vision immediately we
[1:06:46] endeavored to go into Macedonia
[1:06:49] assuredly Gathering I love that that the
[1:06:51] Lord had called us for us for to preach
[1:06:54] the gospel unto them yes sir that's what
[1:06:56] he meant he was a prisoner to the will
[1:06:58] of God brother BR said oh people half
[1:07:00] spiritual can pick that up I think I'm
[1:07:02] at least half spiritual tonight so if
[1:07:05] you're half spiritual tonight let's
[1:07:06] let's pick that up and apply it in our
[1:07:08] lives he said see he was forbidden to do
[1:07:10] his own will only could do he said the
[1:07:13] spirit forbid me see he was a prisoner
[1:07:15] to Christ he said that this little
[1:07:17] fortune teller one day who he know Paul
[1:07:19] knew he had power to cast that devil out
[1:07:21] but he could only do it as God willed it
[1:07:23] now here's another lesson for us yes you
[1:07:25] don't cast out every devil you come
[1:07:29] across boy got quiet it's true though
[1:07:34] because sometimes brother brandom said
[1:07:36] there's a reason why God's dealing with
[1:07:37] that person and that's why brother
[1:07:39] brandom had to learn that by the way
[1:07:41] because early in his ministry every
[1:07:42] every person come across the stage he he
[1:07:44] worked with them until they were healed
[1:07:47] he said and sometimes he took a curse
[1:07:49] off somebody and God had placed it on
[1:07:51] there or allowed it to be put on them so
[1:07:54] you don't cast out every day devil that
[1:07:55] comes along but what you do is you pray
[1:07:58] for everybody you you you lay hands on
[1:08:00] everybody cuz we're called to do that
[1:08:03] and and and so and I don't want you to
[1:08:04] think well God gave me this sickness no
[1:08:07] no God allowed it to be there but he
[1:08:09] also said you're already healed yeah
[1:08:11] you're not waiting on healing you're
[1:08:13] already healed yes sir you just got to
[1:08:15] appropriate the faith to believe it and
[1:08:17] sometimes it takes laying on a hand
[1:08:18] sometimes it takes going through a
[1:08:19] prayer line sometimes it takes being in
[1:08:21] a good service but you got to
[1:08:23] appropriate the faith what you're doing
[1:08:24] is building your faith
[1:08:26] it's already done you're already saved
[1:08:28] amen you already you've already made it
[1:08:31] but you got to you got to build your
[1:08:32] faith to that
[1:08:34] point so now look but he said this
[1:08:37] little fortune teller Paul knew he had
[1:08:39] the power to cast that devil out but he
[1:08:40] could only do it as God will it day
[1:08:42] after day she followed him crying out
[1:08:44] after him but one day the spirit gave
[1:08:46] him permission then he rebuked her the
[1:08:48] spirit that was in her see he knew what
[1:08:50] it was to be a prisoner he talked about
[1:08:52] Moses and his intellectuals he had to
[1:08:54] lose him in order to find Christ to be a
[1:08:55] prisoner then when God got all the world
[1:08:57] beat out of him all of his mighty men
[1:08:59] that he was and stand in the presence of
[1:09:01] that Pillar of Fire that day he was
[1:09:03] found just
[1:09:04] speechless that's a miracle sometimes
[1:09:06] isn't it Jo would that be a miracle if
[1:09:09] if you were found speechless oh but
[1:09:12] sometimes we get in the presence of God
[1:09:14] and we're found
[1:09:16] speechless speechless you just don't God
[1:09:18] so I watched God do some things FR last
[1:09:21] Friday night I watched him do some
[1:09:23] things and I found myself speechless
[1:09:26] unable to say anything why because I
[1:09:28] knew God was working oh church we could
[1:09:30] only reach that place where maybe you
[1:09:32] don't even have the words to to say
[1:09:34] thank you but your your spirit is crying
[1:09:37] out praise and adoration to God right
[1:09:39] when he got in the presence he was
[1:09:41] speechless Lord what do you want me to
[1:09:43] do yes sir he said he couldn't even talk
[1:09:46] he said God had a prisoner
[1:09:48] then amen he said see you won't try
[1:09:52] after your own searching and God had to
[1:09:54] Endo this man or him with power nothing
[1:09:56] could go down there he said Lord I told
[1:09:58] Pharaoh what you said he wouldn't do it
[1:10:00] he said then take this Rod God speaking
[1:10:02] that's God's word go out there and point
[1:10:03] it towards the east and call for flies
[1:10:05] and flies come in creation because he
[1:10:07] had a prisoner that Pharaoh couldn't pay
[1:10:09] off with nothing now look you don't
[1:10:12] think Moses had some inkling of how
[1:10:15] stupid it
[1:10:17] looked to take a
[1:10:19] stick and call for
[1:10:23] flies let there be flies and everybody's
[1:10:26] looking at him saying who does this man
[1:10:27] think he
[1:10:29] is sure he did he was human but he was a
[1:10:34] prisoner he he realized how stupid it
[1:10:37] looked to go down to Egypt with his wife
[1:10:39] on a donkey going down to Egypt and he
[1:10:41] said what are you going down to do I'm
[1:10:42] going down to take over he realized how
[1:10:45] how ineffective that was he realized
[1:10:47] what little he could do but why did he
[1:10:48] do it because he was a prisoner oh
[1:10:51] Church it may look like that
[1:10:53] everything's against you it may look
[1:10:54] like you're not able to do what God
[1:10:56] called you to do but you do it anyway
[1:10:58] because you're a prisoner to the word of
[1:11:00] God not a prisoner of chains but a
[1:11:02] prisoner of
[1:11:03] Love Now look he said then take this
[1:11:06] that Rod God speaking that's God's word
[1:11:07] go out there and point it towards the
[1:11:08] east and call for flies and flies come
[1:11:11] into creation because he had a prisoner
[1:11:13] the Pharaoh couldn't pay off with
[1:11:14] nothing nobody else could turn him no
[1:11:16] away he was a complete prisoner in the
[1:11:18] chains of God's word bound up only to
[1:11:20] thus sayith the Lord yeah he said oh if
[1:11:23] God can get him prisoners like that he
[1:11:24] said that's when he can express the
[1:11:26] preeminence as you see he's got the man
[1:11:28] of the person so that he knows nothing
[1:11:30] but Christ oh that we can get that way
[1:11:32] tonight we know nothing but Christ he
[1:11:34] said all right that's secondly first to
[1:11:36] express himself completely God in Christ
[1:11:40] second to have the preeminence by this
[1:11:42] in his church which is his body the
[1:11:44] bride till he could have the preeminence
[1:11:47] to express himself through them we're
[1:11:51] not all sitting around waiting on
[1:11:52] something to
[1:11:54] happen sitting around waiting on a
[1:11:56] prophet to to do this or a prophet to do
[1:11:58] that Prophet has
[1:12:01] come that we thought Elijah was supposed
[1:12:03] to come said he already
[1:12:05] came and you missed it or you wouldn't
[1:12:08] be looking for him again right oh Church
[1:12:12] you wouldn't be looking for an eighth
[1:12:13] day mess you wouldn't be looking for
[1:12:15] somebody else but he came already and
[1:12:17] they already did to him the
[1:12:18] denominations already turned it down but
[1:12:20] you believed it you're the Bride of
[1:12:22] Jesus Christ who receives it and lives
[1:12:24] it amen becomes that word watch he he
[1:12:28] expresses himself in in in through us he
[1:12:32] said and thirdly to restore the kingdom
[1:12:34] to its rightly position that fell by sin
[1:12:37] by the first adom back to where he
[1:12:40] walked in the cool of the evening with
[1:12:42] his people talked with them fellowship
[1:12:44] with them can you imagine Brother David
[1:12:46] what it'll be like in the Millennium
[1:12:48] period when we're able to fellowship
[1:12:50] with him as a human being here I believe
[1:12:52] there will be a Corporal body I I
[1:12:54] believe that brother that's what
[1:12:55] Believers believe and we'll be able to
[1:12:57] fellowship with him as a human being
[1:12:59] like we are only will have no sin
[1:13:01] there'll be there'll be no sin the devil
[1:13:03] will be bound for a thousand years there
[1:13:05] will be no sorrow no heartache amen our
[1:13:08] bodies will be changed back into a body
[1:13:10] like his glorious body can you imagine
[1:13:13] what it was like f them fellowship with
[1:13:15] him in the Garden of Eden before there
[1:13:17] was sin how much greater will it be when
[1:13:19] we go back to that condition and yet we
[1:13:21] have a testimony I've been redeemed by
[1:13:24] the blood of the Lamb
[1:13:25] they couldn't have that testimony so
[1:13:27] they fail and we've gone through all
[1:13:29] these 6,000 years of history and today
[1:13:31] we stand right at the end of that
[1:13:33] history looking back and say I am
[1:13:35] redeemed I've been bought with a price
[1:13:37] and it won't be very much longer like we
[1:13:39] said Sunday morning we're about to step
[1:13:41] into that place the world is standing in
[1:13:44] Slippery places about to slide into the
[1:13:46] tribulation period but we're standing in
[1:13:48] a sure place on the solid rock of
[1:13:50] revelation of God's word about to step
[1:13:52] into the Rapture oh Wonder if we can
[1:13:55] believe it tonight I wonder if we can
[1:13:56] grab a hold of it tonight is it real to
[1:13:59] us
[1:14:02] church I don't mean to yell at you but I
[1:14:05] wonder sometimes if oh God I pray God
[1:14:07] would stir us
[1:14:08] tonight it's a step the world goes into
[1:14:11] tribulation just a step we go into the
[1:14:14] presence of God or we fellowship with
[1:14:19] him oh what
[1:14:23] that I know it's going to be
[1:14:26] better than what I feel
[1:14:29] here brother
[1:14:31] Harvey there have been moments in my
[1:14:34] life when I've just about busted out of
[1:14:36] My Flesh because I felt the presence of
[1:14:39] God so real and it just felt like I was
[1:14:42] about to go home any moment and it's the
[1:14:44] best moments of my life you what was the
[1:14:46] best moments of your life are the been
[1:14:48] it's those moments when I knew
[1:14:49] everything was under the blood
[1:14:51] everything was right and I was living
[1:14:53] for God not because I had never done
[1:14:54] anything wrong but because he had
[1:14:56] forgiven me he had saved me brought me
[1:14:58] into his house and he loved me and he
[1:15:00] cares about me and I get in the presence
[1:15:02] of God and I feel the the anointing of
[1:15:04] God the presence of God and it just
[1:15:06] seems like nothing can compare to that
[1:15:08] you can have all the ball games you want
[1:15:10] to you can have everything else you want
[1:15:11] to but let me have a moment in the
[1:15:13] presence of God that's just listen to me
[1:15:16] Church brother said just a shadow of a
[1:15:18] shadow of a shadow of what it'll be like
[1:15:20] over
[1:15:21] there all that we can feel here would be
[1:15:24] just a shadow shadow of what it really
[1:15:26] is yes
[1:15:28] sir
[1:15:30] hallelujah oh
[1:15:35] church he said now sin and death had
[1:15:38] separated them from his presence and his
[1:15:40] entire expression he said do you read it
[1:15:43] before the foundation of the world to
[1:15:44] express all of his attributes what he
[1:15:46] was he said therefore if any trinitarian
[1:15:48] here would just let yourself loose a
[1:15:49] minute you can see the father Son and
[1:15:51] the Holy Ghost is not three Gods it's
[1:15:53] three attributes of the same God said
[1:15:55] see it's it's expression father he
[1:15:57] wanted to be a father he was a father he
[1:15:59] was a son and he is the Holy Ghost and
[1:16:02] the father and the Holy Ghost is the
[1:16:03] Same Spirit don't you see he said you
[1:16:05] get it he said not three Gods the devil
[1:16:07] has told you them things to make an
[1:16:09] idolator out of
[1:16:10] you see he said it's one God expressed
[1:16:13] in three attributes to be father to be
[1:16:15] savior to be son to be healer see is his
[1:16:18] expression brother BR talked about how
[1:16:20] each subject could take all day but he
[1:16:22] wanted to make it clear he said God
[1:16:24] expressed in Jesus Christ who is both
[1:16:26] Father Son and Holy Ghost the fullness
[1:16:28] of the godhead bodily oh church I'm
[1:16:32] going to close in just a moment look he
[1:16:34] said now someone say now the complete
[1:16:39] fullness of the godhead bodily dwells in
[1:16:43] his
[1:16:45] church
[1:16:48] when 20 years from now 50 years from now
[1:16:53] when the next great Revival comes along
[1:16:56] the next time we have a meeting it's not
[1:16:57] what he said
[1:17:00] now listen this is something you've
[1:17:03] heard I told you you'd hear some
[1:17:04] catchphrases and some things we say all
[1:17:06] the time because such an important
[1:17:08] message listen all Christ all that God
[1:17:13] was he poured into
[1:17:18] Christ and all Christ was was poured
[1:17:23] into the church the
[1:17:26] Believers oh my I want to stop there in
[1:17:29] Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[1:17:30] but we just take the scripture now in
[1:17:32] Philippians 26 now look he's talking
[1:17:34] about Christ he said who being in the
[1:17:37] form of God the word form is morphe you
[1:17:40] find brother teaching on that in in
[1:17:41] messages like the unveiling of God or
[1:17:43] the Mighty God unveiled before us it's
[1:17:45] morphe it's means to change your mask
[1:17:48] but to be the same in essence yeah all
[1:17:51] that God was he changed his mask and
[1:17:54] poured into Christ
[1:17:56] all that Christ was he changed his mask
[1:18:00] and now he wears your
[1:18:02] mask my
[1:18:03] mask is that simple enough we can all
[1:18:06] understand it now look Mark 16-12 you'll
[1:18:10] find the same word in fact it's the only
[1:18:12] other place in the New Testament where
[1:18:14] this Greek word morphe is used is in
[1:18:15] Mark 16:12 said after that he appeared
[1:18:18] in what another form another form unto
[1:18:23] two of them as they walked and went into
[1:18:24] the country another morphe another
[1:18:26] behind another mask and they'd known him
[1:18:29] in the flesh but they didn't recognize
[1:18:31] him in this form oh Church how many
[1:18:34] people in this hour knew brother brandom
[1:18:36] but didn't recognize Christ when he came
[1:18:38] in Bride
[1:18:39] form right how many people how many
[1:18:42] people recognize oh my that Jesus was
[1:18:45] there but did not recognize when he came
[1:18:47] on the on to the 120 in the upper room
[1:18:50] why he appeared in another form but it
[1:18:52] was still him how do we know it was
[1:18:54] still him he still did the same
[1:18:57] Works Hallelujah now look listen to this
[1:19:00] brother brandom in another sermon this
[1:19:01] is calling Jesus on the scene 1963 we'll
[1:19:04] read this quote and then we'll we'll
[1:19:06] close he said then God all that God was
[1:19:09] someone say all how many things is he
[1:19:12] the head of all things oh do you believe
[1:19:15] it today all that God was he poured into
[1:19:20] Jesus and all that Jesus was he poured
[1:19:23] into his church he divided himself on

[1:19:28] you how he did it he said that Pillar of
[1:19:30] Fire come down and busted itself up the
[1:19:33] shikina glory you remember what that was
[1:19:36] that's his visible presence the shikina
[1:19:38] is the visible presence of God that
[1:19:40] dwelt in the Tabernacle and later in
[1:19:42] Solomon's Temple the shakina glory oh my
[1:19:46] busted itself up and put it in different
[1:19:48] ones tongues of fire were seen upon each
[1:19:51] one the Holy Spirit God identifying him
[1:19:54] himself in human
[1:19:57] beings oh Church what was he doing when
[1:20:00] he come and took had the pillar of fire

[1:20:08] part of that body but God all that God
[1:20:11] was he poured into the church he busted
[1:20:14] himself up and he was over a prophet but
[1:20:16] he's in
[1:20:17] you I love the fact that when that when
[1:20:20] he was there visible as long as Moses
[1:20:22] was on the scene but when Joshua came on
[1:20:24] the scene the pillar of fire was not oh
[1:20:26] my the pillar of fire was not a visible

[1:20:42] people amen you believe that or not I I
[1:20:46] just choose to believe God's with
[1:20:48] us and the amount of God that'll be

[1:21:52] ship right oh yeah even before they went
[1:21:55] and had the prayer meeting and woke him
[1:21:57] up he still was God and the sh his
[1:22:00] purpose could not be defeated he had
[1:22:02] already told him we're passing over to
[1:22:03] the other side and he was the word he's
[1:22:05] already told you there's going to be a
[1:22:07] Rapture he's already told you we're

[1:22:19] amen he's just waiting for you to have
[1:22:21] faith to believe it and sometimes that's
[1:22:23] why he allows tests and trials to come

[1:22:26] with it just waiting on you to have the
[1:22:28] faith to
[1:22:29] believe he is God look you so how secure
[1:22:33] we feel I think about those little
[1:22:34] babies if you'll allow me to digress for
[1:22:36] just a moment think about those little
[1:22:38] babies that in Africa and those little
[1:22:41] babies they wrap them up real tight and
[1:22:43] then they wrap them around the mama and
[1:22:46] they ride motorbikes so there'll be a
[1:22:48] family of five on a dirt
[1:22:51] bike and they'll be riding down the
[1:22:53] street
[1:22:55] I look at that all dressed up for Sunday
[1:22:57] I got a picture last time I was in Togo
[1:22:59] he's going around the big puddles it had
[1:23:01] rained going around the big puddles and
[1:23:03] the potholes you drive down one side
[1:23:04] drive up the other side he's driving all
[1:23:06] around him driving carefully because
[1:23:08] here's his whole family on the motorbike
[1:23:11] the girls in their Sunday dresses put us
[1:23:14] to shame the way they dress I mean they
[1:23:16] really would I'm not saying anything I'm
[1:23:18] not even wearing a tie tonight I'm not
[1:23:19] saying anything about that it's just
[1:23:20] what they do and they just they they
[1:23:22] look so pretty and I'm walking as as
[1:23:24] they go by there and I'm thinking them
[1:23:26] little girls on there and that little
[1:23:28] baby be see here here'll be a man and CH
[1:23:30] the wife will have his arms her arms
[1:23:32] around the man holding on and the baby
[1:23:34] is not being held on by
[1:23:36] anybody but it's
[1:23:38] secure it's wrapped up
[1:23:43] tight hallelujah it's wrapped up tight
[1:23:46] as it goes down the road you don't see
[1:23:48] them falling out all the time but
[1:23:51] they've learned how to wrap the baby in
[1:23:53] such a way that it'll wrap around them
[1:23:55] and it will actually
[1:23:57] stay Hallelujah and the mama will go
[1:23:59] about her work and everything else and
[1:24:01] that baby's so secure and you don't see
[1:24:02] them crying or
[1:24:03] fussing why they're wrapped up tight
[1:24:06] they feel secure oh I believe if we
[1:24:09] would really believe the word tonight
[1:24:10] that's how we would feel we'd feel like
[1:24:13] that little baby that's been wrapped up
[1:24:14] you know how they are when they're
[1:24:15] little newborns little infants they they
[1:24:17] get to want something you just wrap them
[1:24:19] up real tight and they feel secure why
[1:24:21] because they've been in the womb and
[1:24:23] they remember what that feels like well
[1:24:24] I remember there's something inside of
[1:24:26] me I don't remember with my mind but
[1:24:28] something inside of me speaks back to a
[1:24:30] time it remembers a time when I was in
[1:24:32] his mind and totally in his care and so
[1:24:35] when I ride down the highway I'm just as
[1:24:38] secure as that little baby wrapped up in
