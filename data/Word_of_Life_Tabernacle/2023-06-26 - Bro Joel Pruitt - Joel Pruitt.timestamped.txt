[43:33] scripture on my screen I just don't know
[43:34] which one it is
[43:35] he that dwelleth in the secret place or
[43:38] the most high shall abide under the
[43:39] shadow of the Almighty
[43:41] I will say of the Lord he is my refuge
[43:45] and my Fortress my God and him will I
[43:48] trust how many believes that tonight
[43:49] surely he shall deliver thee From The
[43:52] Snare of the Fowler and from the noise
[43:53] some pestilence he shall cover thee with
[43:56] his feathers and under his wings shalt
[43:59] thou trust his truth shall be thy shield
[44:02] and thy buckler Thou shalt not be afraid
[44:05] for the terror by night nor for the
[44:07] arrow that flyeth by day nor for the
[44:09] pestilence that walketh in darkness for
[44:12] the destruction that wasteth that
[44:13] Noonday nor for the destruction that
[44:15] wasted the Noonday A thousand shall
[44:17] follow thy side and ten thousand at thy
[44:19] right hand but it shall not come nigh
[44:23] thee aren't you thankful for that
[44:24] tonight amen you may you may be seated
[44:26] May Lord add His blessings to the word
[44:28] I'll try not to do that again how about
[44:29] that
[44:31] but I was reading this here and you have
[44:34] to excuse me it's hot up here let me
[44:35] take this off
[44:40] that does not preach that does not mean
[44:42] I'm going to preach a long time
[44:44] I just I'm just hot
[44:46] I won't hold you along let me start my
[44:47] timer here
[44:50] we're batting a thousands so far well
[44:52] praise the Lord are you happy to be in
[44:53] the house of the Lord tonight a little
[44:55] simple thought come to me and it was
[44:56] fulfilling the promise of the hour
[44:57] somebody's got to do it
[45:00] somebody's got to fulfill the promise of
[45:01] the hour right and so when you see a
[45:05] promise of a Rapture and it tells you
[45:07] how you're going to be you don't have to
[45:09] be afraid of the things that are going
[45:10] to happen around you you don't have to
[45:12] worry about the tens of thousands that's
[45:13] going to fall but there's going to be
[45:15] somebody in that time that is going to
[45:18] be making it all the way through and
[45:20] somebody's going to be sheltered and hid
[45:22] away in the palms of his hand aren't you
[45:24] thankful for that tonight and brother
[45:25] Branham said somebody has got to fulfill
[45:28] the promises of the hour and if you look
[45:30] back when you think back to to the time
[45:32] of of Jesus Christ he was prophesied
[45:35] there in Psalms that he would come a
[45:37] virgin would conceive and and somebody
[45:39] had to fulfill it and brother Brandon
[45:41] talked about the Jews would miss it
[45:43] because they were looking for it in an
[45:45] intellectual way but let me tell you
[45:46] today they're an intellectual faith has
[45:48] never worked and it will never work but
[45:51] you must provide but must prove to God
[45:53] that you're a Believer by faith in his
[45:55] word and believing from the heart not
[45:57] from something in your mind and not
[45:59] something that that that a person could
[46:01] try to talk you into or convince you
[46:04] into but you've got to believe from the
[46:06] heart and it comes by Revelation through
[46:09] the Vindicated word of the hour and so I
[46:11] think today if we could ever get
[46:13] ourselves hidden away from the things of
[46:15] the world and get away from the voices
[46:17] of the world today and realize that God
[46:19] has got a body today with a voice God
[46:22] has got somebody that is willing to hear
[46:24] the word for the hour and he sets you
[46:27] aside why because you are a promised
[46:29] generation you are somebody that will
[46:32] sit here and put on this Earth to
[46:34] overcome laodicea so that ought to make
[46:36] somebody shout because you are not just
[46:39] wanting a promise or needing a promise
[46:41] but you are actually living out a
[46:43] promise in this day can you say Amen
[46:45] brother Ram talks about in the beginning
[46:47] he said it must have been foggy and
[46:48] dismal and dark as the world was turning
[46:50] and when God knows that he had need of a
[46:52] light he said now his seed was already
[46:54] on the earth because he had planted it
[46:56] there he said now he needed light to
[46:58] bring forth that seed to make that seed
[47:00] live because the seed was already there
[47:03] remember God had a thought and the
[47:05] thought now had to be fulfilled and so
[47:08] he thought I'm going to have a son and
[47:10] I'm going to call his name Adam but now
[47:11] there had to come before become a
[47:13] fulfillment of that thought on the earth
[47:15] if the thought would have been taking
[47:16] place in God's mind and it would have
[47:18] never been fulfilled then God would not
[47:20] have been God but when he thought it
[47:22] then it had to come to pass and in this
[47:24] time he thought of a bride that would
[47:26] not fall and he saw you and he saw me
[47:28] and if he saw it then it has to be
[47:31] fulfilled in this hour and you are
[47:33] hidden away in the secret place today
[47:35] you believe that church
[47:37] can I get some more monitors up here I
[47:39] can't hear it myself at all and he said
[47:42] so just like it is in each age God has
[47:44] foretold us what would take place in
[47:47] each age the only thing he needs is the
[47:50] manifestation of the light of God upon
[47:53] the scripture to make it live for that
[47:55] age
[47:57] how many believes that today so you are
[47:59] the manifestation of the light of God
[48:01] from the scriptures you are the
[48:04] Fulfillment of the word for this day
[48:06] somebody's got to be it might as well be
[48:09] us I'm not willing to set in a dead cold
[48:11] formal church I'm not willing to sit and
[48:14] say that that my family can be lost or
[48:17] or you could just be another Christian
[48:18] or you can just be another Baptist or
[48:20] another Methodist no I am going in a
[48:23] Rapture and therefore I must be hid away
[48:25] in the things of the world in the word I
[48:27] must be hit by the Shadows of the
[48:29] almighty Wings because I'm not here just
[48:32] to be another person but I'm here to be
[48:34] a member of the Bride of Jesus Christ
[48:37] for this day or somebody can preach with
[48:39] me for just a minute we are not here
[48:41] just to be another another member of
[48:43] society we're not here to be affiliated
[48:44] with another party just another Democrat
[48:47] a republican but we're here to be Sons
[48:49] and Daughters of the almighty God we are
[48:52] here to be more than conquerors of the
[48:54] devil that is trying to overtake us and
[48:56] our family and our churches oh somebody
[48:58] preached with me this afternoon you are
[49:00] not here to just sit there and hear the
[49:03] word but we were made to be a
[49:05] fulfillment of the word and so that
[49:06] means we've got to do the word for our
[49:09] day we've got to be living and written
[49:11] Epistles rid of all men why because if
[49:13] you're just if you're just sitting there
[49:15] and you say well I'm a Christian I go to
[49:17] Word of Life Tabernacle and God's been
[49:19] good to us down there but if you don't
[49:21] live the word to that person they'll
[49:22] never believe your testimony but you've
[49:24] got to be a living testimony in the day
[49:27] that we're living in today because that
[49:29] is the Fulfillment of scripture there
[49:30] will be a called out people receive the
[49:32] Holy Ghost and they would be they would
[49:34] be a greater than they would be more
[49:36] than conquerors they would be something
[49:37] that would raise up an invincible army
[49:40] of the Lord Jesus would be here in the
[49:42] end time to overcome laodicea to
[49:45] overcome a generation of perverted and
[49:48] backslidden people there be people that
[49:50] sit in the church and they'll go along
[49:52] with Kay writes and and lesbians and and
[49:54] all these different things church that
[49:56] is not the bride and the bride will not
[49:58] be made up of that but the bride will be
[50:00] made up of a people that will believe
[50:02] the message of the hour and they will
[50:04] act upon the message of the hour we're
[50:06] not here just to play Church we're not
[50:08] here just to have another service but we
[50:10] are here to live out the Vindicated word
[50:13] for our day can you say amen I hope
[50:16] somebody's hearing me today I know it's
[50:18] simple but you need to know who you are
[50:20] you are not just another another
[50:22] believer even because there's been many
[50:24] believers who have decided it wasn't
[50:26] right there have been many who said well
[50:28] the cloud couldn't have taken place
[50:29] because science said it couldn't take
[50:31] place but we can look past science and
[50:33] see a promise of a Vindicated promise
[50:36] today and we can say that Prophet was
[50:38] Vindicated in Malachi 4 he lived out the
[50:41] promise he did what he was told to do
[50:42] Luke 17 30 was fulfilled in our day we
[50:46] can point to the scripture and say this
[50:48] day the scripture was fulfilled but what
[50:50] about a bride that was said to be set
[50:52] there in the book of Psalms he said he
[50:54] would be called out you would be sent
[50:55] under the under the Kings of the
[50:57] almighty and you would be set in a place
[50:59] where nothing could hinder you the
[51:01] pestilences could not come upon you but
[51:03] you are the living body of Christ today
[51:05] and you are the bride that has been made
[51:07] ready for the end time I hope you're
[51:09] hearing me today church we are not just
[51:12] another group of people he should be
[51:14] brides and brides and it'll be churches
[51:16] and churches but this bride is not going
[51:18] to fall this pride is not going to
[51:20] backslide you're not going nowhere but
[51:22] up Church
[51:23] thank you this is not just another time
[51:26] of excitement there's been Pentecostal
[51:28] excitement there's been a motion over
[51:29] this an emotion over that there's been
[51:32] all kinds of that but I think the bride
[51:34] ought to be excited over a revealed word
[51:36] of our day
[51:38] it's not just a glare but it is an
[51:41] actual real light of the time that we're
[51:44] walking in brother Graham said by the
[51:46] word of God the sun shines today because
[51:48] the very son that we're enjoying is
[51:50] God's word made manifest think about it
[51:53] the very Earth that you're living on is
[51:55] the very thought of God
[51:57] he created the heavens and the Earth by
[51:59] a thought
[52:01] you were created by a thought he said
[52:03] the very sunlight this hot weather was a
[52:05] thought
[52:07] when he said let there be light it
[52:09] created light and the Heat
[52:12] he said let there be light and there was
[52:14] he said what if he had said let there be
[52:16] light and there was no light then it
[52:18] wasn't God that spoke but when you say
[52:20] thus saith the Lord that must be a
[52:22] direct order from God it must be God
[52:24] speaking and if God speaks it if it is
[52:27] the saith the Lord it will come to pass
[52:29] every time exactly like it spoke it and
[52:33] he said when God says Let There be there
[52:36] will be when he said let there will be a
[52:38] bride at the end time that would not
[52:39] fall there will be all you have to do is
[52:42] believe that your position in Christ is
[52:44] safe and secure we're not wanting we
[52:46] don't say well there's only going to be
[52:48] two or three in Hardy so maybe this
[52:50] brother's it maybe that brother's it
[52:52] maybe this sister's one of them no I'm
[52:54] I'm claiming that promise for myself
[52:55] because I am an overcomer of a laodicea
[52:59] Satan has tried to get me he's trying to
[53:01] get a lot of young people there's a lot
[53:03] of things on the internet today that's
[53:04] going to try to get you and it's going
[53:06] to try to bring you down there's going
[53:07] to be Sports that'll try to take up your
[53:09] time but listen to me church if you've
[53:11] ever met the light of the hour then
[53:12] you'll recognize who you are you are an
[53:15] overcomer you are more than just another
[53:17] good athlete you are more than just
[53:19] another good preacher you are more than
[53:21] just another good singer but you are the
[53:23] Bride of Jesus Christ Living out the
[53:25] promise in this day can you say Amen
[53:29] brother Williamson we realize that God's
[53:31] light of the day is his son the one the
[53:34] s-u-n this one the is the son he said so
[53:37] in the Bible he said he was in the
[53:38] beginning was the word the word word was
[53:39] with God the Word was God Hebrews 13 18
[53:42] is the same yesterday today and forever
[53:43] he said it's the word of God always it
[53:46] was Christ in Noah it was Christ and
[53:48] Moses it was Christ and David that
[53:51] looked up as a rejected King upon the
[53:52] city where 800 years later Christ would
[53:55] sit there weeping over a city being a
[53:57] rejected King just like David was it's
[54:00] always the spirit of Christ and the full
[54:02] manifestation of God's word was made
[54:04] known through Jesus Christ the spirit of
[54:06] God
[54:08] think about it that was the spirit of
[54:10] Christ in a rejected King and that same
[54:13] Spirit would come again in a rejected
[54:15] King and then that rejected king would
[54:18] go die and send a spirit to the church
[54:20] now who's going to have that same spirit
[54:22] you and I are going to have the same
[54:24] spirit
[54:25] somebody's got to have the same spirit
[54:27] that was in Christ today
[54:30] and it will be a manifestation of the
[54:32] same life that he lived
[54:35] through the spirit
[54:37] brother Graham said and only light can
[54:39] come by the word of God it is revealing
[54:41] it is a manifestation of something to
[54:43] come he said and God's word is the light
[54:46] when it's manifested now you could say
[54:48] well you could go back into Luther's day
[54:51] or Wesley's day and say I believe that
[54:53] the prophet of Malachi 4 came here but
[54:55] where was Delight in that age it was
[54:57] still upon Wesley and it was still upon
[54:59] Luther but what you'll see is when the
[55:01] light came in the days of brother
[55:02] Branham in the seventh angel messenger
[55:04] you could see it wasn't just a glare but
[55:06] the Fulfillment of scripture came with
[55:08] it
[55:10] you can see that all things were
[55:12] fulfilled right there in in the life of
[55:14] brother Branham in the ministry of
[55:15] brother random as the seventh angel can
[55:18] you say Amen
[55:19] brother random said our bodies was on
[55:21] Earth
[55:22] before there was any light here
[55:25] yeah he said or anything the calcium the
[55:28] potash the petroleum and cosmic-like
[55:30] whatever it was was here when God
[55:33] created the Earth it only taken his
[55:35] spoken word to bring it into existence
[55:37] oh I hope you're hearing this tonight
[55:38] see it was it was already here because
[55:41] he thought about it this is what's going
[55:42] to have to be there in order for me to
[55:44] have a son come forth from that Earth so
[55:46] it has to have the pot ash and the
[55:47] calcium and all these things must
[55:49] already be in the earth and so then when
[55:51] he can go to the Earth and he can speak
[55:53] a son why because he's already put the
[55:55] ingredients there and so what he did
[55:57] today is he thought there's got to be a
[55:59] people and so what he did was he sent a
[56:01] message to call you out of something so
[56:04] that he could have you ready to call you
[56:06] forth as Sons and Daughters of God just
[56:09] the same as he did then he had to speak
[56:11] and there would be somebody come and
[56:13] when the spoken word of our day went
[56:15] into the nominational systems and it
[56:17] started preaching to the people there
[56:18] was Sons and Daughters of God that were
[56:21] coming forth from something oh I hope
[56:22] you hear me now they were coming from a
[56:25] dead organized Sensational system into
[56:27] the light of the hour why because God
[56:29] had already placed the seed there but
[56:31] now the light was going to strike the
[56:32] seed and they couldn't sit there any
[56:34] longer but they had to come forth as
[56:37] Sons and Daughters of God because God
[56:39] already saw them as what they were and
[56:41] who they were and where they would be
[56:43] sitting and so he would send a prophet
[56:45] to a little woman in Memphis Tennessee
[56:47] because there was a seed there already
[56:49] and so he would send the prophet there
[56:51] and as soon as the light strikes I
[56:54] already knew he was going to be here the
[56:55] seed was already there and the light
[56:57] come along and the next thing you know
[56:59] it come to life why because God had
[57:01] planted the seed and God had sent the
[57:04] word along to put it put to to dramatize
[57:07] the seed and I hope you hear me tonight
[57:09] church God has not brought you out of a
[57:12] denomination just as another church
[57:14] member but he brought you out to be a
[57:16] living body of Christ on the Earth today
[57:18] I preached that a couple weeks ago here
[57:20] you are more than just another person
[57:22] you are more than just another church
[57:24] member and if you really realize who you
[57:26] are you can't sit there like you once
[57:28] did you can't say well I can just sit
[57:30] here and I can join church over here and
[57:33] I can be a part of this church or this
[57:34] denomination no sir if you've accepted
[57:36] God and if you've accepted the light of
[57:38] your hour it will come to life as soon
[57:40] as it meets the light
[57:43] God has given us the ability to meet the
[57:47] light for our hour and to raise us up
[57:49] the Sons and Daughters of God
[57:51] brother man talks about Jesus he had
[57:53] been prophesied for 4 000 years that he
[57:55] would come he said Messiah and when he
[57:57] come he manifested every promise of the
[57:59] Messiah but yet the people of the world
[58:01] didn't know the churches and so forth
[58:03] didn't know anything about him because
[58:04] they had done gotten some other thing
[58:06] that kept them away from knowing this
[58:08] they had already got their minds made up
[58:10] of how he was going to come instead of
[58:12] checking with the word and allowing the
[58:14] seed to be born and let the light touch
[58:16] the seed see if you want to have a birth
[58:18] you've got to have a seed there in order
[58:20] to have a birth and these people here
[58:22] they were dead and they'll always be
[58:24] dead because there was no seed there in
[58:26] the first place they could hear the
[58:27] message of the hour you think about it
[58:29] there was many of thousands of people
[58:30] that would sit there and watch the signs
[58:33] of Luke 17 30 pass them right over there
[58:36] was many people that would sit there and
[58:37] they would watch a prophet turn his back
[58:39] to the people and call out the People by
[58:41] name from behind him and tell you where
[58:43] you lived in your address people sit
[58:45] there and heard it but there was no seed
[58:47] there the light was there but there was
[58:49] no seed but when you sit there and there
[58:51] may have been somebody just as poor as a
[58:53] church mouse sitting there and they
[58:55] heard the word of God and they
[58:56] recognized that was the light of the day
[58:58] that was Malachi 4. that was Luke 17 30.
[59:02] that was Revelations 10 and 7. why
[59:04] because the light had struck a seed that
[59:07] was living and now it come to life
[59:09] because it had set there maybe they'd
[59:11] sat there unto the Baptist and they set
[59:13] there under the Pentecostal and they sat
[59:15] there and all the deadness of the of the
[59:16] time and and they said in every Church
[59:18] they can think of maybe they were
[59:19] looking for something but when they met
[59:21] the very light that God had sent church
[59:24] I hope you hear me now when you meet the
[59:26] light you can't stay like you were
[59:28] there's got to come a change
[59:31] why because that was fulfilling the
[59:34] promise of the hour and you have got to
[59:36] fulfill the promise of this hour we're
[59:39] not here just to fulfill our duties to
[59:42] the church but we are here to fulfill a
[59:45] promise of the hours that where two or
[59:47] three are gathered I am in the midst he
[59:50] promised it and if you'll come expecting
[59:52] the promise then when he is then when
[59:54] you come together expect him to be here
[59:56] and he's got to show up
[59:58] because you're fulfilling a promise
[1:00:02] do you love the Lord tonight
[1:00:04] brother man goes on and I'll try to
[1:00:06] hurry he said now Jesus was all the
[1:00:08] inspired prophet's testimonies and all
[1:00:11] their prophecy was brought to light in
[1:00:12] his age
[1:00:14] that had been prophesied for his age he
[1:00:17] lit up every candle of word that was in
[1:00:20] the Bible
[1:00:21] that was prophesied of him a virgin
[1:00:24] shall conceive and she did
[1:00:27] he said all right his name Shall be
[1:00:29] Called counselor Prince of Peace Mighty
[1:00:31] God Everlasting father he was the eyes
[1:00:33] of the blind shall see they did
[1:00:35] everything that was prophesied and
[1:00:37] happened when he come on the earth why
[1:00:39] because it was a true revelation of who
[1:00:42] he was and when he recognized that he
[1:00:44] went and did exactly and fulfilled the
[1:00:47] scriptures exactly as they come
[1:00:49] he said and why the people could not see
[1:00:52] that he said it seems strange to us now
[1:00:54] because we are looking back through a
[1:00:56] rearview mirror but did you ever know if
[1:00:59] you keep looking back that way you'll
[1:01:00] wreck he said let's look ahead what is
[1:01:03] for us
[1:01:05] we can look back and see that they
[1:01:07] missed it denominational people can tell
[1:01:09] you they missed the very coming of the
[1:01:11] Messiah but if you're not careful you'll
[1:01:13] fall in the same rut that they're in
[1:01:14] because we if we look back to that and
[1:01:17] keep our eyes focused well it's got to
[1:01:18] be something great happen it's got to be
[1:01:20] another man come through the city on a
[1:01:22] donkey no that was fulfilled but now
[1:01:24] there is another fulfilling today and I
[1:01:27] would like to stand here and I'd like to
[1:01:28] Proclaim to you that this day the
[1:01:31] message of the hour is fulfilled before
[1:01:33] your eyes because I'll tell you another
[1:01:35] promise a lot of people Overlook of
[1:01:37] another promise he said there'd be some
[1:01:39] young man that would pick this message
[1:01:40] up and take it on to the coming of the
[1:01:42] Lord I'm going to fulfill that promise
[1:01:44] your pastor is going to fulfill that
[1:01:45] promise we're not going to sit down
[1:01:47] we're not going to shut up we're not
[1:01:49] going to wait for somebody to tell us
[1:01:51] that we can't preach no more no we are
[1:01:53] going to fulfill brother Stewart the
[1:01:55] promise that we are going to go into all
[1:01:57] the world and preach the good news in
[1:01:59] the power and the demonstration of the
[1:02:01] Gospel
[1:02:03] these are all of our promises
[1:02:05] why give up on them now in a very time
[1:02:08] of Leo to see him in a time of dead cold
[1:02:11] lukewarm church members this is the day
[1:02:13] when you might as well stand on the
[1:02:15] Promises of God I'll tell you there's an
[1:02:17] old song Standing on the Promises
[1:02:18] brother it's not sitting on the premises
[1:02:20] only but we come here and we sit down
[1:02:22] and we hear the word of God and when the
[1:02:24] power of the Lord comes Upon Our Hearts
[1:02:26] and the light strikes the seed you can't
[1:02:28] help but move under the anointing of the
[1:02:30] Holy Ghost the anointing is not just for
[1:02:33] the preacher it's for the hearer as well
[1:02:35] because when the hearer will get
[1:02:37] anointed with the same spirit that the
[1:02:39] preachers got on him then they can
[1:02:41] become a doer of the same word
[1:02:43] we're not here just to preach we're not
[1:02:45] here just to have a three o'clock
[1:02:46] service on a Sunday afternoon but what
[1:02:48] we're here to do is to fulfill what
[1:02:51] we're promised to do because gathering
[1:02:53] together is not just something we do
[1:02:55] because there's more offerings taken up
[1:02:56] where there's more electricity used and
[1:02:59] it's not just something because we eat
[1:03:00] and it's a social Gathering no sir
[1:03:01] that's not what it is but the fulfilling
[1:03:04] of the scripture that said that much
[1:03:06] more as the days I don't care how many
[1:03:08] times a week you have church I'm not
[1:03:10] putting you out for having it once a
[1:03:11] week or twice a week but I'll tell you
[1:03:13] why not have it some more in an age
[1:03:15] where we can have too much time for this
[1:03:16] we can go fishing every day of the week
[1:03:18] we can go to a ball game every day of
[1:03:20] the week I'll tell you what somebody
[1:03:22] ought to preach with me now somebody who
[1:03:24] they might miss church for this or miss
[1:03:25] church for that let me tell you
[1:03:26] something if God is in your heart
[1:03:28] brother you can't wait for them Church
[1:03:30] doors to open if it was every night of
[1:03:32] the week if it was Monday through
[1:03:33] Saturday and twice on Sunday if thought
[1:03:36] it was in your heart if there was a way
[1:03:37] to be there you'd be there why because
[1:03:39] God has placed a desire in your heart to
[1:03:42] worship him in his hand House of God and
[1:03:44] if God has placed something in your
[1:03:46] heart I want to go hear the word of God
[1:03:47] I can't be the same sitting at home I
[1:03:50] get cold I get indifferent I get down on
[1:03:53] myself let me tell you something church
[1:03:54] we sit around long enough wondering why
[1:03:56] does the pastor do this why does the
[1:03:58] church do this I'll tell you why we do
[1:04:00] it because we want to see Souls saved we
[1:04:02] want to see a move of God in the church
[1:04:04] again we want to see Souls come back
[1:04:06] home that have been lost and they've
[1:04:08] wandered around from church to church
[1:04:10] let me tell you something they can be
[1:04:11] dead they can be cold but we want to sit
[1:04:14] here where the fire of the Living God is
[1:04:16] still moving upon the people I'll tell
[1:04:18] you somebody ought to testify with me we
[1:04:20] don't want a dead church here we want
[1:04:22] the word to move the people
[1:04:24] oh yes come on
[1:04:26] you wonder why churches get a little
[1:04:29] dried up I'll tell you because of
[1:04:31] preaching their complexes instead of the
[1:04:32] word of God we don't want that around
[1:04:34] here
[1:04:35] what we want is the word to be preached
[1:04:38] and you to be free to Worship in any way
[1:04:40] you want to because God has not given
[1:04:43] you a spirit of fear the pastor is not
[1:04:46] here saying well you can't say Amen in
[1:04:48] church you can't raise your hand up in
[1:04:50] church no he's saying let the word
[1:04:52] penetrate your heart and let it bring
[1:04:54] forth the Son and Daughter of God
[1:04:55] because that's what we need
[1:04:59] we need to be reborn
[1:05:01] we need something new the changes from
[1:05:03] the inside out that is a promise of the
[1:05:05] hour that there would be somebody that
[1:05:08] would have a new birth and make a
[1:05:09] Rapture you can't make it any other way
[1:05:12] program goes on down here I'm about to
[1:05:14] run out of time
[1:05:16] well then said certainly
[1:05:18] John had been prophesied by Isaiah
[1:05:21] 712 years before his birth
[1:05:24] and that voice of one would be crying in
[1:05:26] the wilderness and also Malachi the last
[1:05:29] of the prophets 400 years before his
[1:05:31] coming in the third chapter behold I
[1:05:33] send my messenger before my face to
[1:05:35] prepare the way he said here was John on
[1:05:38] the earth making that written word live
[1:05:41] he said he was the voice of one crying
[1:05:43] in the wilderness
[1:05:45] and also was preparing the way before
[1:05:47] the Messiah
[1:05:48] Jesus said you love to walk in his light
[1:05:51] because he was that light bright and
[1:05:53] Shining Light
[1:05:55] and John he said now I must decrease
[1:05:59] my light must go out
[1:06:01] because I have served my time
[1:06:03] that's prophesied of me and he says hear
[1:06:07] ye him he is the one to to follow it
[1:06:11] living in that day he said it proved
[1:06:13] this now brother Brahm said the Jews
[1:06:16] thought that they were worshiping in the
[1:06:18] True Light
[1:06:19] and I wonder how many today in the
[1:06:21] Methodist and the and the Wesleyan
[1:06:22] churches think they're serving a True
[1:06:24] Light because they're walking in
[1:06:26] everything that they may know
[1:06:28] they don't see the light for the day
[1:06:30] because they're actually following what
[1:06:32] looks like a light and it is a glare
[1:06:34] from another day because there's still
[1:06:36] just a little bit of a light there what
[1:06:37] it is it's a light shining onto
[1:06:39] something it's a glare it's not the True
[1:06:41] Light of the hour but what they're doing
[1:06:43] is following a false light it's a mirage
[1:06:45] brother random calls it you're going out
[1:06:47] in the desert you're hot I know some of
[1:06:49] you are you're hot and you're sitting
[1:06:50] there and you're wondering you're like
[1:06:52] you're like like where am I going to go
[1:06:53] what am I going to do I want you to see
[1:06:55] something that looks almost real and you
[1:06:57] follow after it what is it it is a false
[1:07:00] light and when you get there you'll
[1:07:01] realize if you try to dive in there
[1:07:03] ain't no water there it's all dried up
[1:07:05] it's just a false light you go over
[1:07:08] there to the Pentecostal church and
[1:07:09] you'll see that Pentecostal church and
[1:07:11] they may have the speaking in tongues
[1:07:12] they may have the shouting they may have
[1:07:14] the dancing they may have the best music
[1:07:16] and all those things may be okay but
[1:07:18] you'll find out that they're missing the
[1:07:20] very word for the hour why because it's
[1:07:23] a false light
[1:07:24] now they may be walking in all the light
[1:07:26] they know they may be Christians but if
[1:07:28] they don't know the word for their hour
[1:07:30] they cannot walk in it but if there is a
[1:07:33] seed and then brother if there is a seed
[1:07:35] there and if the light ever strikes it
[1:07:37] then they can't stay there no longer
[1:07:39] they can have they may have to come out
[1:07:41] of that once they see the light why
[1:07:43] because the light is not the Pentecostal
[1:07:45] night it is not a Lutheran Life it is
[1:07:47] not a glare for another age but this
[1:07:49] light is an evening timeline with an
[1:07:52] evening time people who are going to
[1:07:53] overcome an end time period of
[1:07:56] tribulation listen we're not going to be
[1:07:57] here for it because what we're
[1:07:59] overcoming is almost a pre-tribulation
[1:08:01] you could say you'll see the squeeze
[1:08:03] it'll come on you'll see people that'll
[1:08:05] be trying to be pulled in to sports
[1:08:07] they'll be tried to be pulled in to a
[1:08:09] worldly entertainment they'll be trying
[1:08:10] to pull in the worldliness of the
[1:08:12] letters all around them it is going to
[1:08:14] be the Overcomers that do not fall to
[1:08:16] that they're going to go on a Rapture
[1:08:18] and completely miss the tribulation
[1:08:21] the ones that'll fall into that a little
[1:08:23] bit they wonder why did they do it why
[1:08:25] can they be pulled so far from the truth
[1:08:27] because maybe there wasn't a seed there
[1:08:29] for the light of this hour
[1:08:31] well it's just the truth sometimes but I
[1:08:33] believe if you're sitting here on a hot
[1:08:35] Sunday afternoon and you're sitting in a
[1:08:38] three o'clock service I don't believe
[1:08:39] that that could be just any ordinary
[1:08:41] Christian but I think that must be
[1:08:43] somebody who wants to hear the word of
[1:08:45] God and let it move upon their hearts
[1:08:47] and it changes us from the inside out we
[1:08:50] are no longer a wolf in sheep's clothing
[1:08:52] but we are a sheep from the inside out
[1:08:54] with the world that's growing on us
[1:08:56] brother it's from the inside it is a
[1:08:58] true thing it's not just a covering that
[1:09:00] we put on it's not brothers and sisters
[1:09:02] you see them sisters wearing their long
[1:09:04] dresses and her long hair they're not
[1:09:06] doing that just to look cool no they are
[1:09:08] doing it because they have sold out
[1:09:10] their own ideas they're sold out what
[1:09:12] they thought they were they don't want
[1:09:13] to be just another beauty queen but they
[1:09:15] want to be a daughter of God why because
[1:09:17] Beauty will only last so long but a
[1:09:20] daughter of God is eternal brother let
[1:09:22] me tell you something today we are not
[1:09:24] here just to be another member of
[1:09:26] society maybe you could be a president
[1:09:28] someday and you tell your kids maybe you
[1:09:30] could be a great quarterbacker maybe he
[1:09:31] could be a president or or a congressman
[1:09:33] or maybe you could be the the senator or
[1:09:35] the the governor or something like that
[1:09:37] but brother what I want him to do is
[1:09:39] that the Lord tarries is to be preachers
[1:09:41] in the house of God where I wanted to be
[1:09:43] grow up to be something maybe a deacon
[1:09:45] maybe they don't do nothing but sit
[1:09:46] there in the church but let me tell you
[1:09:48] I want to see him there every time the
[1:09:50] doors are open not because I'm a message
[1:09:52] believer but because they have
[1:09:54] experienced God for themselves and
[1:09:56] because they have a seed on the inside
[1:09:57] and the light that is of the age the
[1:10:00] light of the hour when it strikes them
[1:10:01] they won't sit there and just little
[1:10:04] kids anymore but they'll grow into sons
[1:10:06] of God they're not going to be just
[1:10:07] another Pruitts on the front row but
[1:10:09] they're going to be sons of God that'll
[1:10:11] fulfill scripture in this day the same
[1:10:14] as every one of us do this day this
[1:10:17] scripture
[1:10:18] must be fulfilled and it's got to be
[1:10:21] fulfilled by somebody why not us
[1:10:25] president said the hour is at hand now
[1:10:27] when the light is shining
[1:10:30] The Gospel Light in his power of the
[1:10:32] resurrection of Christ
[1:10:34] manifesting himself that Jesus Christ is
[1:10:36] the same yesterday and forever
[1:10:38] he lauded that for this day
[1:10:41] the things that he promised for this day
[1:10:43] must happen in this day
[1:10:45] if the church won't accept it God is
[1:10:48] able of these stones to rise children
[1:10:50] unto Abraham he'll get his message over
[1:10:53] because he's always done it and he
[1:10:55] always will
[1:10:58] somebody
[1:10:59] has got to accept
[1:11:01] the message of the hour
[1:11:04] If the message came there has to be a
[1:11:07] seed to respond to the word
[1:11:09] it did not come in vain God's word will
[1:11:12] never go out in vain but it will always
[1:11:14] go out and it will bring in all kinds
[1:11:16] there will be fish and there will be
[1:11:18] Turtles and brother Ram talks about it
[1:11:19] the net will catch all kinds but the
[1:11:21] true fish will stay there because
[1:11:23] they're feeding on something but brother
[1:11:25] Ben talked about it this morning they're
[1:11:27] feeding on the body word of the son of
[1:11:28] man and that's what we the bride of
[1:11:30] Christ are feeding on today we're not
[1:11:32] feeding on just another idea or another
[1:11:34] myth or or another denominational idea
[1:11:36] but brother we're feeding on the very
[1:11:39] word of God that has been fulfilled in
[1:11:41] this hour you ought to be the happiest
[1:11:42] people in the face of the Earth you say
[1:11:45] we don't need shouting in the church no
[1:11:46] more let me go and tell you something
[1:11:47] we're the only people that have anything
[1:11:49] to shout about
[1:11:51] yeah
[1:11:52] we're the only people that even have a
[1:11:55] right to shout because there's
[1:11:56] worshipers worshiping in vain all across
[1:11:59] the world but you have been called out a
[1:12:02] royal priesthood you have been set aside
[1:12:04] and called from the sin that you were in
[1:12:06] to say here today and you can say I am
[1:12:09] not just an abominational I'm not a
[1:12:11] chicken no more but remember the chicken
[1:12:13] will sit around there and cook and
[1:12:15] they'll find problems with each other we
[1:12:17] do that all the time as at this flesh
[1:12:18] sometimes I think it's chicken in the
[1:12:20] inside's eagle
[1:12:23] sometimes we get a little you know we
[1:12:25] start picking on one another a little
[1:12:26] bit we get a little dry in our
[1:12:28] experience but why don't we just let
[1:12:30] that go and forget about our daily work
[1:12:33] and forget who might have done us wrong
[1:12:35] and forget about those who maybe we say
[1:12:37] well this one here maybe you just
[1:12:39] misunderstood them maybe let's just let
[1:12:41] it go let's be brothers and sisters why
[1:12:43] don't we just love one another anyway
[1:12:44] because this pride is going to be a
[1:12:46] Capstone bride with love amongst them we
[1:12:49] are not going to be a hateful bunch of
[1:12:50] people always picking on one another we
[1:12:52] ever see a chicken at the in the
[1:12:54] barnyard and they peck on each other and
[1:12:56] they're pulling the feathers out yeah
[1:12:57] that's the way a bunch of chickens are
[1:12:59] they're sitting over there and they got
[1:13:00] some ladies sitting around talking about
[1:13:02] the soup supper and they kick some woman
[1:13:03] out because she cooked the wrong kind of
[1:13:05] soup but brother I'll tell you this you
[1:13:08] are not called to sit around with the
[1:13:10] things of the world it doesn't really
[1:13:12] matter so much about how nice of a
[1:13:14] facility you've got it doesn't matter
[1:13:15] how good the food was next door but what
[1:13:18] matters is the word being preached in
[1:13:20] the power in the demonstration are you
[1:13:22] sitting here in Heavenly places finding
[1:13:25] your position as sons and daughters of
[1:13:27] God how many can say I am an overcomer I
[1:13:31] am who God says I am
[1:13:34] I'm not a chicken I'm an eagle and you
[1:13:37] sound different
[1:13:39] you don't act like a chicken does
[1:13:41] you fly higher you see beyond military
[1:13:44] vehicles can see farther you see beyond
[1:13:47] the things of the world you know that
[1:13:49] when they start going over there trying
[1:13:50] to take over Putin
[1:13:52] let me go and tell you something we
[1:13:53] ain't got nothing to worry about because
[1:13:55] brother Branham said before the bomb
[1:13:57] would ever be released he said the bride
[1:13:59] would be picked up he said before one
[1:14:01] drop of fire ever fell on Sodom Abraham
[1:14:04] was already out anyway let me go ahead
[1:14:06] and tell you something you don't have to
[1:14:07] fear little pride because you are
[1:14:09] fulfilling scripture and the scripture
[1:14:11] said he wouldn't lose one of you
[1:14:15] so I think that's the age where to live
[1:14:16] in an age of promises an age of
[1:14:19] blessings an age of overcoming yes
[1:14:22] Satan's gonna fight you yes he's going
[1:14:24] to try to bring you down he's going to
[1:14:26] try to show you your faults with your
[1:14:27] brother and your sister that's his job
[1:14:29] he's always going to be there in your
[1:14:31] mind but you don't have to look at it
[1:14:33] you don't have to pay attention to it
[1:14:35] what you have to do is keep your eyes on
[1:14:37] the promise keep your eyes on the North
[1:14:39] Star and walk in the light of the hour
[1:14:41] because if you're walking in the light
[1:14:43] as he is in the light then you can have
[1:14:45] fellowship with God then you can have
[1:14:47] fellowship with your brother you can
[1:14:49] love one another more
[1:14:51] why because we're more
[1:14:53] than just another denominational chicken
[1:14:55] pin
[1:14:57] said the Pharisees and the Sadducees and
[1:14:59] the herodians and whatever might be
[1:15:01] they got the world so gummed up
[1:15:04] my iPad tried to correct that word
[1:15:08] it didn't recognize it in the English
[1:15:10] language
[1:15:12] but I think we know what a prophet meant
[1:15:14] when he was just pretty simple because
[1:15:15] we can look around now and see that the
[1:15:17] world is pretty gummed up
[1:15:20] like they did in all the ages
[1:15:22] they could not see the real light
[1:15:25] church if you could ever see the message
[1:15:28] and if you look at look back through
[1:15:30] history and you see the way it happened
[1:15:32] in Moses and Noah and with Jesus you'll
[1:15:35] see it as exactly the same program today
[1:15:37] and has happened in the same way
[1:15:39] it is so biblical that when a church
[1:15:42] tries to prove you wrong all you have to
[1:15:43] say Do you believe this this and this
[1:15:45] and walk them through the Bible most of
[1:15:47] the time what you'll find is they don't
[1:15:49] believe what really happened then what
[1:15:51] you're talking to is a make-believer
[1:15:53] that's really an atheist
[1:15:55] and so what you've got today brother
[1:15:58] Graham said Jesus Christ is just as real
[1:16:01] today to a human heart as he ever was
[1:16:06] that's right his power and his living
[1:16:08] presence is just as real today as it
[1:16:11] ever was
[1:16:12] he said Lo a little while in the world
[1:16:14] will see me tomorrow brother says Cosmos
[1:16:16] the order of the world won't see me no
[1:16:18] more
[1:16:19] yet you shall see me
[1:16:21] for I'll be with you even in you until
[1:16:24] the end of the world that's Bible how
[1:16:25] many believes that
[1:16:27] that's a promise it's not written there
[1:16:29] just to make you feel good it's a
[1:16:31] promise to you if you'll accept it as
[1:16:33] such
[1:16:34] he said and he said and then he said
[1:16:36] until the end of the world the works
[1:16:37] that I do shall you do also even greater
[1:16:41] than this shall you do because I go to
[1:16:43] my father
[1:16:45] he said that great promise is today
[1:16:48] he says all that and then he says that
[1:16:50] great promise is today period
[1:16:54] the world is as blind as they can be
[1:16:57] but there is a ye shall see me
[1:17:01] that's how he puts it in quote unquote
[1:17:03] there is a ye shall see me who's he's
[1:17:06] talking to a special group of people
[1:17:09] there is a called out people that will
[1:17:11] see him because he's living among them
[1:17:14] will this bless my heart it was in the
[1:17:16] message you ought to go listen to it
[1:17:18] turn on the light 1964.
[1:17:20] it's a powerful sermon brother but I'm
[1:17:22] talking about the life of the age and
[1:17:24] and all the different glares and the
[1:17:25] mirages of things most of the quotes
[1:17:26] I've taken today have been from that
[1:17:27] sermon and he said
[1:17:30] he said there will be there is a ye
[1:17:34] shall see me and that's what we're
[1:17:36] trying to get today what the Full Gospel
[1:17:39] is to express Jesus Christ in the power
[1:17:42] of his resurrection and all the fullness
[1:17:45] of his promises that the Holy Ghost
[1:17:48] manifests these things and make them
[1:17:50] right that God has promised and he will
[1:17:54] do it
[1:17:56] now I think sometimes we Overlook the
[1:17:58] Simplicity of the message
[1:18:00] because it doesn't sound deep enough
[1:18:03] but there is a ye shall see me on earth
[1:18:05] now
[1:18:06] and the promise has got to happen
[1:18:08] because he said so period that's all
[1:18:11] there is to it do you need to know any
[1:18:13] more no you're going to see him you're
[1:18:15] going to feel him you're going to
[1:18:16] recognize him because his presence is
[1:18:18] living among you and in you and around
[1:18:21] you and you can't get away from him if
[1:18:22] you've ever accepted him
[1:18:24] because you can't be lost once you've
[1:18:26] accepted the very Spirit of Christ
[1:18:30] says now all we are today all we are
[1:18:33] today is the display of his attributes
[1:18:37] first he was not even God
[1:18:40] we would just call him the Eternal one
[1:18:42] because he wasn't God he had to be
[1:18:43] worshiped God is an object of worship
[1:18:45] how many knows that God is an object he
[1:18:47] couldn't even be God without you
[1:18:50] because you've got to worship God now
[1:18:52] let me tell you something you quit
[1:18:53] worshiping
[1:18:54] we got a problem
[1:18:56] because God has got to be worshiped by
[1:18:58] somebody because if you don't worship
[1:19:00] him he's going to make the stones
[1:19:01] worship him if you don't stop making
[1:19:03] worship the gravel out here is going to
[1:19:05] start worshiping somebody has got to
[1:19:07] worship God in spirit and Truth
[1:19:11] not just in spirit only maybe the
[1:19:13] Pentecostals could do a pretty good job
[1:19:14] of worshiping the spirit and somebody
[1:19:16] maybe can sit there and say I'm word
[1:19:18] only well that's okay if your word only
[1:19:20] then the word says spirit and Truth both
[1:19:23] together you can't have one without the
[1:19:25] other if you've got just the word and
[1:19:27] it's never been and it's never had the
[1:19:28] spirit upon it what you've got is a dead
[1:19:30] letter but what you've got to have is a
[1:19:32] spirit and Truth together why because
[1:19:34] it's biblical because it's true and when
[1:19:37] you have both together then brother
[1:19:39] that'll make you move on down the road
[1:19:40] you've heard the message it is a rising
[1:19:42] of the sun you take the two Cadillacs
[1:19:44] side by side and one of them is just as
[1:19:46] good as the other one they got the same
[1:19:48] Mechanical Devices I think brother
[1:19:49] Brandon calls them a 16 cylinder car and
[1:19:51] you got them sitting there and he said
[1:19:53] one of them you put water in the gas
[1:19:54] tank and one of them in the uh you put
[1:19:57] gas in the gas tank he said and you
[1:19:58] start them try to start them both up he
[1:20:00] said that one car with gas will take off
[1:20:02] and run right on down the highway but
[1:20:03] that car no matter how mechanically
[1:20:05] indoctrinally sound it is it'll set
[1:20:08] there with water in the tank it won't
[1:20:09] move a muscle
[1:20:11] try to tell me you're a living body of
[1:20:13] Christ and you put water in the gas tank
[1:20:14] brother I'll tell you what you need is
[1:20:16] you need another Soul Filling Station
[1:20:18] you need to meet God on his terms one
[1:20:21] time and lose your idea of how you're
[1:20:23] going to worship God and let him move
[1:20:25] through you and your Worship in ways
[1:20:27] that you never thought possible before
[1:20:30] because you're worshiping God
[1:20:33] not from the flesh but you're worshiping
[1:20:35] him because of what he's done for you
[1:20:37] you're worshiping because the truth has
[1:20:39] been revealed to you
[1:20:41] just you nobody else can be a part of
[1:20:44] this bride but you had a seed you are
[1:20:47] somebody that is beyond just listen
[1:20:49] Church you don't realize how blessed you
[1:20:51] are
[1:20:52] you are someone that has a seed you
[1:20:55] couldn't put it there nobody else could
[1:20:57] put a pair your mom and your dad can't
[1:20:59] put that seed there but because you have
[1:21:01] it you have recognized the light for the
[1:21:04] hour you are the only people who can go
[1:21:07] in a Rapture is you who have recognized
[1:21:10] the light of your age
[1:21:12] you have been hidden you've been set in
[1:21:14] a secret place the most high you're
[1:21:16] under the shadow of his wings why
[1:21:18] because you are the called out set aside
[1:21:22] predestinated body of Jesus Christ
[1:21:25] how do we know that a prophet came and
[1:21:27] fulfilled the scripture
[1:21:28] because he preached what the scripture
[1:21:30] says and the scripture said he would
[1:21:32] come you say well I don't have to
[1:21:34] believe that because I believe it's okay
[1:21:35] just to go to the Baptist Church well it
[1:21:37] may be if there's no seed there
[1:21:40] be the best Baptist you can be
[1:21:43] but let me tell you something if there's
[1:21:44] a seed there you can run as far as you
[1:21:46] want to try to run but it will not run
[1:21:48] far enough where the light can't find it
[1:21:51] you see these young people that once
[1:21:52] that they go out in the world they were
[1:21:54] in the message
[1:21:55] they might have had the most emotional
[1:21:57] experience you could ever find at a
[1:21:59] youth camp
[1:22:00] and I believe in it
[1:22:02] but that's not what's going to hold them
[1:22:03] until the end but when the word strikes
[1:22:06] the seed on the inside brother I don't
[1:22:08] care how much stuff on the internet I
[1:22:11] don't care how many people are trying to
[1:22:13] pull them to and fro once the word and
[1:22:15] the seed strike each other you can't
[1:22:17] pull them away you can't run them off
[1:22:19] you can't keep them away I'll tell you
[1:22:21] what they might go to church and there
[1:22:22] might be some correction come across the
[1:22:23] pulpit you can't run them off why
[1:22:26] because they are word-borne seed and
[1:22:28] when the word strikes it something is
[1:22:30] connected there and you can't get away
[1:22:32] from it
[1:22:33] I got two minutes is that all right
[1:22:37] I'm out of time I promise you brother
[1:22:39] Bram talks about the attributes being
[1:22:40] expressed and I'll just go this and I'll
[1:22:42] quit
[1:22:43] program said and now remember you
[1:22:44] Christians were his thoughts before
[1:22:46] there was a world
[1:22:48] you are the manifestation of his
[1:22:50] thinking before there even was a world
[1:22:52] you were in Christ that's a paradox
[1:22:57] before there even was a world
[1:23:00] God thought of you
[1:23:02] he not only knew your end but he knew
[1:23:04] your beginning and he knew every moment
[1:23:06] in between
[1:23:08] you know
[1:23:09] I think we don't give enough credit
[1:23:10] where credit's due
[1:23:14] I wonder if sometimes we don't just
[1:23:15] completely forget Who We Are
[1:23:19] give yourself a little credit you're the
[1:23:21] Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:23:22] you don't have to be downtrodden you
[1:23:25] don't have to allow depression to stay
[1:23:28] you don't even have to allow sickness to
[1:23:30] stay in your body
[1:23:32] because you don't realize that God has
[1:23:34] already given you a spirit of authority
[1:23:36] in you oh I hope you're hearing me now
[1:23:38] I'll close with this the very spirit
[1:23:40] that was in Christ is the very Authority
[1:23:43] that is in the bride you can do the same
[1:23:45] Works everything he did is in you I know
[1:23:48] I preached this a couple weeks ago but I
[1:23:49] want to just remind you of something
[1:23:50] don't ever settle for second place when
[1:23:54] God has given you full authority to walk
[1:23:57] all over the devil brother Bill Satan
[1:23:59] might attack you in your body buddy but
[1:24:01] he cannot I said he cannot overtake you
[1:24:04] until it's your time nobody can take you
[1:24:06] out because you are a son of God
[1:24:09] predestinated he knew your beginning
[1:24:11] date he knows you're in pain nothing can
[1:24:13] happen between then that's not ordained
[1:24:15] of God brother let me tell you that'll
[1:24:16] take the fear of sickness that'll take
[1:24:19] the fear of all these diseases in the
[1:24:21] world away from you because not until
[1:24:23] God is done with you and exactly the
[1:24:25] date he saw you expire and leave this
[1:24:28] earth then he and nobody can take you
[1:24:30] out of here he said well the devil's
[1:24:32] trying to take me out he can't do it
[1:24:35] the devil's trying to he's trying to
[1:24:37] kill me he can't kill you because God
[1:24:40] has already seen you and in and he's
[1:24:43] already come to give you an end that he
[1:24:45] knows about I'll tell you brother let's
[1:24:47] give up on letting the devil have so
[1:24:49] much credit and let's give credit to the
[1:24:51] authority that is in the Bride of Jesus
[1:24:53] Christ
[1:24:54] we're more than conquerors because we
[1:24:57] believe
[1:24:58] the age we're living in is more than
[1:25:02] just a bunch of jellyfish
[1:25:04] well praise the Lord
[1:25:06] we have been put here on this Earth and
[1:25:08] we've been given a sword
[1:25:10] a sword we've been given that we've been
[1:25:12] given a helmet we've been given a full
[1:25:15] body armor
[1:25:17] and you might as well just go ahead and
[1:25:18] walk all over the devil one time
[1:25:21] and tell him Satan
[1:25:22] you might find you know the devil was
[1:25:24] fighting with a headache since last
[1:25:25] night
[1:25:26] and he's tried to fight me through this
[1:25:28] whole thing
[1:25:29] and I can stand here now and tell you
[1:25:30] the headache's gone and I praise the
[1:25:31] Lord for it
[1:25:35] listen to me Church Satan is nothing but
[1:25:38] a bluff
[1:25:39] he's going to try to hold you down he's
[1:25:41] going to tell you when you're when your
[1:25:43] kid makes their first mistake well maybe
[1:25:45] they're not seed don't ever think that
[1:25:48] put the token on that family put the
[1:25:50] token over that child and just believe
[1:25:52] God for it
[1:25:53] this is the day
[1:25:56] brother we need to be putting the blood
[1:25:57] back on the doorpost we need to be
[1:25:59] showing up and doing what God wants us
[1:26:01] to do to fulfill the scriptures and the
[1:26:04] word of our hour this is not a rule and
[1:26:07] a law this is not something that you
[1:26:08] have to do but brother just let the word
[1:26:10] of God let it guide you into the truth
[1:26:13] of the hour and it will make you
[1:26:15] manifest the son of the hour because you
[1:26:18] are fulfilling all the promises of the
[1:26:22] hour
[1:26:23] aren't you thankful for that
[1:26:25] we are
[1:26:27] the word made flesh today

[1:26:51] minute

[1:26:54] eye for just a minute
