[40:09] and kneeled to him and asked him good
[40:11] master
[40:12] what shall i do that i may inherit
[40:14] eternal life
[40:16] and you know one thing i've never really
[40:17] realized in reading this story is that
[40:19] that it was what would be called the
[40:21] rich young ruler but he came running to
[40:22] christ he had an urgent request
[40:24] is that right and jesus said unto him
[40:27] why call us thou me good
[40:28] there is none good but one and that is
[40:30] god thou knowest the commandments
[40:32] do not commit adultery do not kill do
[40:34] not steal do not bear false witness
[40:36] defraud not honor thy father and mother
[40:38] and he answered him and said to him
[40:40] master all these i observe have observed
[40:42] for my youth
[40:43] then jesus behold in him and love loved
[40:45] him and said unto him
[40:47] one thing thou lack is go thy way and
[40:49] sell whatever thou hast and give to the
[40:51] poor and thou shalt have treasure in
[40:53] heaven and come take up thy cross and
[40:55] follow me
[40:56] and he was sad at that saying and went
[40:58] away grieved for he had great
[41:00] possessions

[41:17] couldn't get anything to work but
[41:19] i'd like to speak if i could just for a
[41:20] little bit on determination
[41:23] this evening and i was determined not to
[41:25] give up and
[41:26] and the lord finally blessed it and and
[41:28] saw fit amen but
[41:30] i think that's the thing of you i'd like
[41:32] to just kind of start off just just
[41:34] asking you know have you ever met
[41:35] somebody that's been determined about
[41:36] something
[41:38] you know no matter what what you wanted
[41:39] to do what you try to do you couldn't
[41:41] stop them
[41:41] you know you ever get your your child
[41:43] gets something on his mind and
[41:45] they're very determined to get that
[41:46] exact thing done and you can't stop it
[41:48] until they're done
[41:49] is that right you know tonight when i
[41:51] got home from work their grandma
[41:53] had bought the boys some little cars and
[41:55] they didn't have the right size
[41:56] screwdriver to fit it
[41:57] so from the second i walked into the
[41:59] house so the second we left
[42:00] daddy wears a screwdriver can we go look
[42:02] here can we go look here and
[42:04] i'm like leave me alone we'll get it
[42:05] maybe after church if not tomorrow
[42:07] but they were determined to get that
[42:08] screwdriver and so we see that in our in
[42:11] our in our life in our christian walk
[42:13] and in just in our lives in general
[42:16] what we are determined what we're
[42:17] determined to do is what's going to be
[42:19] the outcome of our actions is that right
[42:21] so
[42:21] if you're determined to be a good
[42:23] christian
[42:24] god will grant that to you if you're
[42:26] determined to be an average christian
[42:27] and you put in an average effort then
[42:29] god's going to allow
[42:30] you to be an average christian the odds
[42:31] not going to come down and and
[42:33] miraculously just give you what you want
[42:34] just because you say well i want this
[42:36] but you've got to actually do something
[42:38] uh in in this battle in this fight and
[42:41] you notice here the rich young ruler he
[42:42] came running and many times we see
[42:44] people they come into the message they
[42:46] come into
[42:47] uh maybe into uh christianity and they
[42:50] just
[42:50] run a hundred miles an hour and they're
[42:52] kind of like the the parable of the
[42:53] tortoise and the hare and
[42:55] you see that rabbit's just running as
[42:56] fast as he can but the but the tortoise
[42:58] has determination he's focused
[43:00] he doesn't either the rabbit gets
[43:01] distracted he looks at this he looks
[43:03] this way looks that way
[43:04] but the turtle has a termination and
[43:06] stays on track is that rhyme
[43:08] now we see brother branham says in a
[43:10] court trial in birmingham he says in
[43:12] 1964 he says so joshua said i stealed
[43:14] the people and said i don't care how
[43:16] great they seem
[43:17] to be and how much opposition he said
[43:19] how much fanatical it seems remember god
[43:21] said when we're in egypt
[43:22] i have given you this land i've given it
[43:24] to you so
[43:25] even before they had possession of that
[43:27] land joshua had to come and remind them
[43:30] that this land that they were looking at
[43:31] they were going to be fighting for
[43:33] was their land because god had promised
[43:35] it and now he wasn't just going in there
[43:37] sweep it out and plaster on the walls
[43:39] until you come in and get you a
[43:40] get mom's chair and sit down and say
[43:42] well we'll have the maids fix the bed
[43:44] for you he don't do it that way
[43:46] joshua wasn't told by god everywhere or
[43:48] joshua was told by god everywhere the
[43:50] soles of your feet steps
[43:51] i've given to you he said foot
[43:54] footprints means possessions he says
[43:56] and every promise in the book to the is
[43:58] to the believers and you've got to make
[44:00] footprints through it
[44:01] you've got to fight every inch of the
[44:03] way you haven't got no fight in you
[44:05] he says if you haven't got no fight in
[44:07] you then get out of the game and
[44:08] and i love how brother branham says that
[44:10] right there he says you know not going
[44:11] in there and just sweep it out and bring
[44:12] in mama's chair and sit down if you want
[44:14] something you have to go and earn it is
[44:16] that right
[44:17] and we know that in our in our physical
[44:19] lives if we want
[44:20] you know unfortunately as much as the
[44:22] government is trying to hand out money
[44:24] there's no way that you can just sit
[44:25] around and not
[44:26] if you want to better your life you have
[44:27] to go better your life is that right
[44:29] if you want to go and get something done
[44:31] or if you want a new house or you want a
[44:32] new car you have to go and work for that
[44:34] is that right and so we see in
[44:36] christianity if you want things it's not
[44:38] that we have to go and do works as in
[44:40] the catholic church does works
[44:41] but god does put a level of
[44:43] responsibility upon the believer that
[44:45] we've got to trust in him that when he
[44:47] says it's ours we've got to walk towards
[44:48] that is that right
[44:50] but i love how brother bram says right
[44:51] there if you haven't got no fight in you
[44:53] then get out of the game
[44:54] and you know this year i've i've done a
[44:57] new thing and i didn't want to do it but
[44:59] i was asked to do it and so i'm coaching
[45:01] a little league team for eight-year-old
[45:03] boys and
[45:04] you know three kids is too many for me
[45:06] already but now 11 additional ones is
[45:08] way too much and
[45:09] and you can see kids who have
[45:10] determination and then you have some
[45:12] kids who just give up
[45:14] they miss the ball they are done they
[45:16] are destroyed the world has ended
[45:19] no hope and you see a kid who will miss
[45:21] the ball and he will try
[45:23] until you just your hands are blistered
[45:24] from throwing it to him and
[45:26] and you can see that's a natural thing
[45:27] and sometimes that's the way maybe
[45:29] parents bring their kids up and
[45:31] maybe the way that maybe the way that
[45:32] the kids just nature just the way that
[45:34] kids nature are but
[45:35] but we come to a point a point as adults
[45:38] and as
[45:38] young adults and teenagers and and we
[45:41] come to a point to where we can no
[45:42] longer really blame our parents we can't
[45:44] really blame society anymore
[45:46] we've we've got to come to a point where
[45:47] he says you know what if i still can't
[45:49] catch the ball it's because i'm not
[45:50] practicing i'm not putting in the time
[45:52] i'm not trying enough and
[45:53] and as christians you can only blame the
[45:55] pastor so long you can only blame lay
[45:56] members other lay members so long until
[45:59] finally you got to just come to the
[46:00] point and say you know what maybe the
[46:01] reason my christian walk is not where i
[46:03] want it to be is because of me
[46:04] is that right and so we see as
[46:06] christians you know
[46:07] i could blame brother ben and say well
[46:08] you're not doing this you're not doing
[46:10] that but my prayer life is not in his
[46:11] control
[46:12] is that right that's in my control and
[46:14] so we we see here that as christians
[46:16] it's not that god's just come in and
[46:17] made a flower but at ease and just
[46:19] as brother graham said plaster the walls
[46:21] moved in mama's chair and have the maid
[46:23] bring something in for you
[46:24] but we've got something to do is that
[46:26] right we've got to be determined to get
[46:28] to see that what god has given us the
[46:30] promises that god has given us
[46:32] we've got to have the determination to
[46:33] see it through now
[46:36] tonight i would just like to focus just
[46:37] a little bit on determination if we
[46:39] could and
[46:39] and the definition for determine means
[46:41] to resolve
[46:42] to conclude or to come to a decision now
[46:46] in in um in our lives especially in my
[46:50] life
[46:50] one of my least favorite things to do is
[46:52] make a decision
[46:54] me and my wife going out to eat i just
[46:56] want her to pick
[46:57] you know what she just wants me to pick
[47:00] and for some odd reason we both picked
[47:02] the last time so it's it's always
[47:03] this year your turn it's my turn and and
[47:06] again and i've one thing i've noticed in
[47:08] life is
[47:09] is maybe you know the more uh maybe the
[47:11] more physical labor that you do
[47:12] or uh or one thing i've known in the
[47:14] financial industries the the
[47:16] the higher ups make the bigger decisions
[47:18] they have to make that determination
[47:20] and be exact and absolute on that
[47:22] determination and
[47:23] and we see that the the determination
[47:25] means the act of determining or deciding
[47:28] and so we hear many times you know the
[47:30] song i have decided to follow
[47:32] jesus but when you see someone that's
[47:33] fully determined you see someone that's
[47:35] steadfast and it doesn't mean they're
[47:37] moving faster than everybody
[47:38] but they've been moving continuously in
[47:40] the same direction for a very extended
[47:42] a long period of time and in that word
[47:45] it means firm resolution
[47:46] a settled purpose and i believe as
[47:49] as i've looked back on my christian life
[47:51] i can definitely say i've
[47:53] i've wondered and strayed and not been
[47:55] perfect by no means and i think anybody
[47:57] in here could have tested that and
[47:58] my christian walk has been that it's
[48:00] been a walk it's been a journey you can
[48:02] ask my wife and
[48:03] and she's obviously our 10-year
[48:05] anniversary is like in a week and
[48:06] so she's obviously determined to stay
[48:08] married to to me after all the things
[48:10] that i've put her through and
[48:12] and so we see that you know you've got
[48:14] to be determined but you look at your
[48:15] christian walk and
[48:16] and one thing i can say is that i have
[48:18] always stayed focused on christ amen so
[48:21] i can look back and say you know i
[48:22] haven't been perfect i haven't always
[48:23] done this or i haven't done that but
[48:25] i can i can tell you that i am
[48:26] determined to serve him amen i may not
[48:29] see everything the same way you see it
[48:30] or you may not see everything the same
[48:31] way i see it
[48:33] but i do have one common goal and that's
[48:35] for me to make it to heaven and everyone
[48:36] else that i know to make it to heaven
[48:38] i don't ever want to kick anybody out
[48:40] and i think if you ever get the attitude
[48:41] that
[48:42] that that somebody is not good enough
[48:44] for heaven then you've got the the wrong
[48:46] mental idea
[48:47] you've got the wrong idea anytime you
[48:48] start trying to scripturalize or
[48:50] messagize people out of heaven
[48:52] you've got the wrong motive and
[48:53] objective amen jesus said he'd come to
[48:56] seek those that were lost he came and he
[48:58] made his home with the drunkards and
[48:59] with the harlots and
[49:00] and we see today that sometimes it seems
[49:02] like as message people we've got this
[49:04] conception
[49:04] not us here but maybe other message
[49:06] people or other christians or other
[49:08] denominations
[49:09] that we're a higher up and i know we've
[49:10] got a higher calling
[49:12] but we should never try to push people
[49:14] out of the message is that right or push
[49:16] people out of salvation
[49:17] and i believe if you look back through
[49:19] the times and and the message and
[49:21] and i was kind of thinking the other day
[49:22] as i was driving and and i was actually
[49:24] thinking about toys and
[49:26] and and my little boy and i i cannot
[49:28] stand it but at school pokemon is coming
[49:30] back
[49:31] and man that was so demonic when i was a
[49:35] kid
[49:35] and i remember like certain cartoons
[49:37] were so demonic
[49:39] like transformers was demonic and this
[49:41] is demonic and now it's okay
[49:43] in some places but things that we used
[49:45] to definitely not accept i remember when
[49:47] southern gospel was
[49:49] you know if the base was too loud it was
[49:50] rocky and now contemporary music's in
[49:52] and
[49:53] man i would have gotten in so much
[49:54] trouble for listening to my praise and
[49:55] worship back and then
[49:57] but now praise and worship but it's okay
[49:58] to listen to and so you look at all
[50:00] these things that have rolled down i'm
[50:01] not telling you how to live your lives
[50:03] or anything you
[50:04] you talk to your pastor and the holy
[50:06] ghost will lead you and guide you where
[50:07] you need to be but
[50:09] but we see that we know you can listen
[50:10] to things and and i remember i was i was
[50:12] i was sitting in the uh the bathroom
[50:14] with paxton and and i was watching
[50:16] um a youtube video of a church playing a
[50:19] song and it was a great song we sing it
[50:21] here and i can't remember the name of it
[50:23] but he looks at me goes daddy said rock
[50:25] and roll and i was like oh
[50:27] you know but i mean they were they were
[50:29] jamming out they were getting in the
[50:30] spirit of that but it was more of the
[50:31] spirit of the music not the spirit of
[50:33] words and
[50:34] and so you know obviously we can take uh
[50:36] we could take music as musicians and
[50:37] we could take amazing grace and we could
[50:39] make it rockish you know we could we
[50:40] could do anything that we want to
[50:42] and it's the spirit that you worship in
[50:44] and and you could take a good service
[50:46] and you could make it a bad service with
[50:47] a spirit that you worship in or
[50:49] choose not to worship in is that right
[50:51] but as christians you've got to come to
[50:52] church you've got to be determined
[50:54] that what you ask for it will be given
[50:56] and i know this is really
[50:58] different from my style it's more of a
[50:59] little teaching but
[51:01] that's what this way i feel led tonight
[51:03] so that's the way we're going to go and
[51:04] if i try to do anything that wasn't me
[51:06] then we'd fall flat on our face which
[51:09] usually usually how it goes anyways but
[51:11] we'll get through it amen
[51:13] but determination is a firm resolution a
[51:15] settled purpose now you're going to get
[51:17] a specific thing done
[51:18] no matter what and you know as you look
[51:21] in the scriptures daniel had purpose in
[51:23] his heart
[51:24] not to eat the king's meat he followed
[51:26] that through to the end and we see that
[51:27] it was blessed and
[51:28] and we see today the thing that that is
[51:30] so bad for for our culture and our group
[51:33] of people in our age
[51:34] is is today we have so many choices is
[51:37] that right
[51:38] and that's why in today's age people
[51:39] seem to give up so easy
[51:41] the media has portrayed a picture that
[51:43] if something doesn't work the first time
[51:45] then try something new is that right
[51:47] and so we see that today there's over
[51:49] about 310 religions and denominations in
[51:51] the united states and
[51:53] the phrase under god can mean something
[51:55] different to members of approximately
[51:57] 313 religions or denominations in the
[52:00] united states and
[52:01] for monotheists who believe god is one
[52:03] to the judeo-christian traditions and
[52:05] the polytheists and those believe in
[52:07] many gods to others who believe and know
[52:08] god and
[52:09] or as god is represented by animal
[52:11] spirits and alien groups and
[52:13] uh and other things and and so we look
[52:17] and we see that that whenever we say
[52:18] under god people can have a different
[52:20] description of that and
[52:21] and they've determined in their hearts
[52:22] what god is is that right
[52:25] now we look here and as we go through
[52:27] and and what people don't like
[52:29] is is is figuring out one thing and um
[52:32] and following it through is that right
[52:34] and so we see that people come down
[52:36] today and if if um
[52:37] you know if if one restaurant doesn't
[52:39] suffice you you can go to the next
[52:41] restaurant if that one doesn't suffice
[52:42] you can go to the next restaurant and
[52:44] if this minister doesn't suffice you go
[52:45] to this minister and if this pastor
[52:47] doesn't suffice you go to that pastor
[52:49] and so we see that people have a lot
[52:50] more options today is that right
[52:52] you know back when it was a it was a
[52:54] horse and buggy times and
[52:56] and doing these things you know and
[52:58] going different places it was a lot
[52:59] harder
[53:00] to go somewhere else is that right once
[53:01] you went to town it wasn't that you
[53:03] you know maybe well i don't like this
[53:05] town so i'm going to go to the next town
[53:06] well that was a lot of extra work is
[53:08] that right
[53:09] and so what people do is when they just
[53:10] don't like something they just go to the
[53:12] next is that right
[53:13] people seem to have no determinations to
[53:15] six to stick through a situation
[53:18] now you look and you you look um and i
[53:20] look as
[53:21] as i used to work in the funeral home as
[53:22] joe does now and i was in
[53:24] denominational churches quite often and
[53:26] you look at the ministerial boards or
[53:28] the pastor boards
[53:29] or that and it's changing all the time
[53:30] you know they may have a pastor for a
[53:31] year too then have another pastor for a
[53:33] year or two or have another pastor for
[53:34] year two because when they get
[53:35] upset with a pastor they just complain
[53:38] to the board the board moves him to
[53:39] another church and then moves
[53:40] and it's just kind of like rotation you
[53:41] know and nobody's really determined to
[53:43] give someone enough time is that right
[53:45] that's why i believe you know as brother
[53:46] ben coming in being our new pastor we
[53:48] ought to as respectful as christians
[53:50] ought to
[53:50] allow that to take time and of course i
[53:53] love brother ben and definitely a big
[53:54] supporter of brother ben but
[53:56] we definitely should look at that and
[53:57] say you know i'm not going to jump ship
[53:58] just because he preached one sermon that
[53:59] i don't like we've got to determine in
[54:01] our hearts that we're going to follow
[54:02] through to the end is that right
[54:04] so you see if you if you look at this
[54:06] you know it's the opposite of everything
[54:07] that god taught in the scriptures just
[54:09] moving to this one moving to that one
[54:11] moving to this one and moving to that
[54:12] one if you didn't like this then go over
[54:14] here and so we see that that's the
[54:15] opposite of everything that god
[54:17] has ever showed us in the bible and and
[54:19] today one thing that i've noticed
[54:21] you know we have so many choices and and
[54:24] one of my examples i know i i
[54:26] always talk about my kids but man used
[54:28] to when i was
[54:29] going into the gas station with my
[54:31] grandma to pick out a snack
[54:33] there was like four or five options now
[54:36] there's like four or five options of
[54:37] each individual item you know it's like
[54:39] cheetos with doritos cheetos with
[54:41] pretzels cheetos with fiery flames and
[54:43] cheetos jalapeno flavored and so it's
[54:45] like 18 different options for one item
[54:47] is that right and it's like
[54:48] well we're gonna please this one please
[54:50] this one please this one and marketing
[54:51] has now developed a way to please
[54:53] everybody is that right
[54:55] amen do you love the lord tonight are
[54:56] you gonna stick with me just for a
[54:57] little bit longer
[54:58] i don't have my watch so i've been going
[55:01] about 15 minutes so
[55:03] halfway there hey man
[55:06] man i really thought i'd get some amens
[55:08] on that one
[55:10] but we see that that's how that's what's
[55:12] happened today is we just have too many
[55:13] choices to pick from and
[55:15] and i remember when i was a when i was a
[55:17] young kid in north carolina you know as
[55:18] us
[55:20] straight from arkansas over just
[55:21] straight through the bible belt
[55:23] you know on the way to church we drove
[55:24] through like past eight other message
[55:26] churches you know and you kind of just
[55:27] had your pick and there were some people
[55:29] who did that they would one month be in
[55:30] this one one month being that one one
[55:32] month being this one
[55:33] and so it's just kind of just a
[55:34] roundabout and and you kind of wonder
[55:36] and you kind of feel sorry for those
[55:38] people you know they're they just can't
[55:39] find anything that would please them
[55:41] and so as christians i don't think we
[55:43] ought to look for the pastor to please
[55:45] us although we ought to understand and
[55:46] have compassion upon the pastor but we
[55:48] ought to be looking for christ
[55:49] and be led by the holy spirit is that
[55:51] right because i believe this
[55:53] i believe brother branham says the
[55:54] spirit of god will never lead you where
[55:55] the grace of god can't keep you is that
[55:57] right
[55:58] so we see that when we're led by christ
[55:59] he's going to positionally place us in
[56:02] the bride in the body of christ where we
[56:04] need to be
[56:05] and then we've got to be determined as
[56:07] christians to stay steadfast
[56:08] in that position now now
[56:12] they they have churches for specific
[56:14] groups of people that they've even come
[56:15] out with now and i remember
[56:17] you know i love seeing cowboy churches
[56:19] and it's just a church
[56:21] not a denomination but just centralized
[56:23] around cowboys and they drive their
[56:24] cowboys to church or drive their horses
[56:26] drive their horses see that's the age
[56:28] that i live in they ride their horses to
[56:30] church
[56:30] and and so you see they ride the horse
[56:32] and buggies and they instead of saying
[56:34] amen they say yeehaw and i'm seeing this
[56:36] serious this is not a joke this
[56:37] actually happens and there's several
[56:39] around here actually and i've been to
[56:40] funerals instead of saying amen they say
[56:42] yee ha and it's just different
[56:44] but they've you know they've itemized
[56:46] and and changed church to where you know
[56:48] it can be
[56:49] you know whatever you want it to be and
[56:51] they've marketed church for a specific
[56:54] group or specific uh specification of
[56:57] people
[56:58] and what it's doing is is instead of
[57:00] changing the people to fit god they're
[57:02] changing the word and changing god and
[57:04] the scripture to fit the people
[57:05] and that's where if you ever try to
[57:07] change the word to fit you you're
[57:08] automatically wrong amen you've got to
[57:10] change yourself to fit him
[57:13] now we see this word adversity it means
[57:15] an event or series of events which
[57:17] which oppose success or desire it's
[57:20] misfortune calamity or affliction or
[57:22] distress
[57:23] it's a state of unhappiness now satan is
[57:26] the master of confusion is that right he
[57:28] has no truth in him there's no sure
[57:30] foundation so anything that he speaks is
[57:32] going to cause
[57:33] chaos and confusion now an
[57:36] adversity causes confusion now adversity
[57:38] you hear a lot in the church is when
[57:40] someone's
[57:41] in adversity a church is an adversity it
[57:43] means that the people are crying out
[57:44] against one another the people are
[57:46] against one another
[57:47] and i believe brother branham talks
[57:48] about that and says you know a
[57:50] fellowship is two people in the same
[57:51] boat
[57:52] row in the same direction is that right
[57:54] now you can have adversity in your work
[57:56] life you can have adversity in your home
[57:58] life you can have adversity in your
[57:59] church life
[58:00] it's all depending upon you and so
[58:03] tonight i know i talk about this a lot
[58:05] and
[58:05] but everything comes back to you now i i
[58:08] love and i know i'm
[58:09] i'm not doing away with the atonement or
[58:11] anything with what jesus christ did
[58:12] because i know everything he did at
[58:14] calvary settled it
[58:15] when he rose again and our names have
[58:17] been put on the book of life i know none
[58:19] of that changes but the life you live as
[58:20] a christian is determined specifically
[58:23] on how you
[58:23] focus your life you can actually brother
[58:26] branham says you can be a weak christian
[58:28] if you want to be a weak christian or
[58:30] you can be a
[58:30] person of strong faith if you want to be
[58:33] a person of strong faith
[58:35] now and just just to look here at some
[58:37] adversity and some different things and
[58:39] different options
[58:40] there's about 150 000 different
[58:42] medications that are
[58:43] in use currently and the number of
[58:46] prescriptions americans feel
[58:47] is about three and a half billion yearly
[58:50] so
[58:50] that's not including over-the-counter
[58:52] those are just prescribed drugs and
[58:54] these
[58:54] these facts are just a few years old and
[58:56] and so we see that there's so many many
[58:58] different medications today there's
[59:00] there's hundreds of medications now for
[59:02] headaches
[59:04] you know do you have a a frontal lobe
[59:06] headache is it behind the eye is it a
[59:07] tension headache is it a migraine
[59:09] headache
[59:10] and it seems like there's so many
[59:11] different options for headaches now and
[59:13] there's so many different options for
[59:14] this well
[59:15] we're gonna give you this medicine for
[59:16] heartburn but if it causes headaches and
[59:18] we're going to give you this medicine
[59:19] but this may cause stomach aches well
[59:20] then we got another one if it causes
[59:22] stomach aches and
[59:22] and so the things just go on and on and
[59:24] on and on and we see that there's
[59:26] hundreds of cough medicines and
[59:28] and there's medic there's medications
[59:30] with worse side effects than there
[59:31] actually is
[59:32] if you actually had the sickness and and
[59:34] so we see that life is all about
[59:35] decisions and life is about
[59:37] choices and and options and and the
[59:39] thing that options do is they get you
[59:41] distracted is that right
[59:43] now we see that people have lost their
[59:46] determination
[59:47] because they have lost their focus now
[59:50] you know it seems like people down to
[59:52] days they need sleep aids then they also
[59:54] need something to pick them up in the
[59:55] morning then they need common agents and
[59:56] they need something to raise their blood
[59:58] pressure they need something to get them
[59:59] excited
[1:00:00] and so you know i actually did that the
[1:00:02] other night i
[1:00:03] i don't take medicine very often i don't
[1:00:05] like to and
[1:00:06] you know i i don't like it now i do like
[1:00:09] caffeine
[1:00:10] i'm not going to lie about that i have
[1:00:12] recently switched to coffee and black
[1:00:14] coffee just just straight and and then
[1:00:16] but i don't like medication i like to
[1:00:18] take tylenol but i took these
[1:00:20] uh these zeke will melatonin tab tablets
[1:00:22] the other night
[1:00:23] and i don't dream but i had some vivid
[1:00:26] crazy dreams and it was just
[1:00:28] it was just weird and i i don't like
[1:00:29] being under the influence of that stuff
[1:00:31] and
[1:00:32] and i was telling my wife i was like
[1:00:33] well i slept really really good but i
[1:00:34] was busy all night
[1:00:36] you know i had this dream that we were
[1:00:37] in this airbnb and the owner kept coming
[1:00:39] in and waking us up and i was furious
[1:00:41] and
[1:00:42] that was all night eight and a half
[1:00:43] hours of that all night and and so
[1:00:46] it's like it didn't really help me much
[1:00:47] but but we see we have so many options
[1:00:49] and you can get just the melatonin
[1:00:51] gummies the melatonin drops and
[1:00:52] and it seems like well if you're not
[1:00:54] sleeping good take this well then i'm
[1:00:55] drugging in the morning we'll we'll take
[1:00:57] caffeine you got got caffeine pills we
[1:00:59] got energy drinks we got coffee
[1:01:01] and so it's constantly well like i need
[1:01:02] something to put me down i need
[1:01:03] something to pick me up and
[1:01:04] and we see in today's age you know i
[1:01:06] believe if people just had the
[1:01:07] determination just to push through just
[1:01:09] a little bit we can
[1:01:10] form our lives i believe it says it
[1:01:12] takes 21 days to create a habit in your
[1:01:14] life is that right
[1:01:16] and so we see that we've got we've got
[1:01:18] all different kinds of options but what
[1:01:20] we really need is god's help is that
[1:01:21] right
[1:01:22] now married married adults now divorced
[1:01:25] two and a half times as often as adults
[1:01:27] did 20 years ago and four times as often
[1:01:29] as they did
[1:01:30] 50 years ago now in 40 and between 40
[1:01:33] and 60 of new marriages will eventually
[1:01:35] end in divorce
[1:01:37] the the probability within the first
[1:01:39] five years is 20
[1:01:41] and the probability of it ending within
[1:01:43] the first 10 years is 30
[1:01:44] 33 perhaps 25 percent of children
[1:01:48] ages 16 and under live with a step
[1:01:50] parent now this is a 2012
[1:01:52] 29 of those married in the united states
[1:01:54] are divorced before 10 years of marriage
[1:01:57] now it says here one thing that i that i
[1:01:59] found was
[1:02:00] was was neat to me and not that anything
[1:02:02] about divorce is need but the enrichment
[1:02:03] journal says that the divorce rate in
[1:02:05] america for the first marriage is 41
[1:02:08] the second marriage is 60 and the third
[1:02:10] marriage is 73 percent
[1:02:12] so it shows you that a person that's
[1:02:14] been married one time
[1:02:15] has a 41 percent of divorce a second
[1:02:17] marriage is 60
[1:02:18] and a third marriage is 73 and what this
[1:02:21] shows you is that once you start giving
[1:02:23] up it gets easier to give up
[1:02:25] so we see that with people who hop
[1:02:27] around from church to church it gets
[1:02:29] easier to move
[1:02:30] from church to church the more that you
[1:02:32] do it it gets easier to backslide the
[1:02:34] more that you do it it gets easier to
[1:02:35] lay out a church the more that you do it
[1:02:37] so we see that as christians the more
[1:02:39] that we step aside the more that we lose
[1:02:42] our focus and determination the easier
[1:02:44] it becomes to be distracted
[1:02:46] is that right so we see here that i'm
[1:02:49] just going to keep going on and
[1:02:51] and we see that the more that you doubt
[1:02:54] god
[1:02:55] the next time the easier it is to doubt
[1:02:57] god now there's a reverse effect to this
[1:02:59] too
[1:03:00] the more you believe god the easier it
[1:03:02] is the next time to trust god amen
[1:03:04] so i don't want to just focus on the bad
[1:03:06] tonight i always want to focus on the
[1:03:07] good but the more
[1:03:08] faith that you build in your life the
[1:03:10] easier it is to believe next time
[1:03:12] is that right you know the more that my
[1:03:14] family's healed the more that i'm healed
[1:03:16] the more the easier it is next time i go
[1:03:18] to ask god to know that he's able to
[1:03:19] heal us
[1:03:21] amen we see the rich young ruler he kid
[1:03:23] the sad thing about the rich young
[1:03:24] rulers he ran to christ he was urgently
[1:03:27] running to him
[1:03:28] to find exactly what he needed and maybe
[1:03:31] not what he wanted but exactly what he
[1:03:32] needed but you notice the thing about
[1:03:34] the rich young ruler is he went away
[1:03:35] sad but he continued on as he was he
[1:03:38] still went to church
[1:03:38] still did all these different things
[1:03:40] still did everything but he could not do
[1:03:42] the one thing that christ asked him that
[1:03:43] was to lay down everything he had and
[1:03:45] give to the poor
[1:03:46] take up his cross and follow him now we
[1:03:49] see that jesus stands at the door and
[1:03:51] knocks
[1:03:52] he is very determined to get to you but
[1:03:54] you've got to be determined once
[1:03:56] jesus gets a hold of you and i'm talking
[1:03:58] about the christian
[1:03:59] the saved holy ghost-filled christian
[1:04:01] tonight not not not we're not talking
[1:04:03] about new new christians coming in or or
[1:04:06] people that aren't filled with the holy
[1:04:07] ghost we're talking about the christian
[1:04:09] tonight that sits in this church that
[1:04:11] needs to be determined
[1:04:12] and focused on god so i'm not talking
[1:04:14] about anything else i'm talking about
[1:04:15] the christian life
[1:04:17] that you and i live it can be as good as
[1:04:19] you and i want it to be
[1:04:20] right your marriage will be as good as
[1:04:22] you determine it to be
[1:04:24] your work life will be as good as you
[1:04:25] determine it to be if you go in with a
[1:04:27] bad attitude bad things are going to
[1:04:29] happen
[1:04:29] if you wake up with a bad attitude and
[1:04:31] get an argument with your wife and
[1:04:32] purposely try to argue things are going
[1:04:34] to happen if you come to church
[1:04:35] matt at the minister matt at the
[1:04:36] preacher matthew deakins matt at the
[1:04:38] trustees
[1:04:39] mad at the la members bad things are
[1:04:41] going to happen you determine your
[1:04:43] christian walk you can't blame it on the
[1:04:44] pastor you can't blame it on the
[1:04:46] minister
[1:04:46] you can't do those things you've got to
[1:04:48] take responsibility for your life
[1:04:50] is that right i don't know who this is
[1:04:52] for maybe it's for me but you've got to
[1:04:54] start taking responsibility for your
[1:04:55] actions and not saying well i don't know
[1:04:57] why
[1:04:58] i don't know why i don't know why why is
[1:04:59] this happening why is this happening
[1:05:01] instead of saying that why don't you
[1:05:03] stand up and believe god and say this is
[1:05:04] what god promised me
[1:05:06] and this is what's going to happen amen
[1:05:09] now we see in matthew 24 and verse 12
[1:05:11] and because iniquity shall abound the
[1:05:13] love of many shall wax cold
[1:05:15] and so that iniquity which we see is
[1:05:16] great in this age that iniquity that is
[1:05:18] abounding is distractions to you and i
[1:05:20] is that right so we see that
[1:05:22] because iniquity abounded because
[1:05:24] distractions abounded
[1:05:25] the love of many will wax cold he says
[1:05:27] but he that shall endure to the end the
[1:05:29] same shall be saved
[1:05:31] so he that will endure to the end he who
[1:05:33] will stay focused he will who is
[1:05:35] determined to make
[1:05:36] it to the end will be saved is that
[1:05:38] right
[1:05:39] he says i want to give you a warning
[1:05:40] right here he says it it says concerning
[1:05:42] the last days because of the abounding
[1:05:44] iniquity the love of many will wax cold
[1:05:46] and laodicean or last age self-love or
[1:05:48] love of material things will take the
[1:05:50] place of the true love of god he says
[1:05:52] we need to guard against the power of
[1:05:54] sin in the last days
[1:05:56] so many are getting so hard because they
[1:05:58] haven't realized the effects of this
[1:05:59] last day
[1:06:00] spirit he said it's time to draw an eye
[1:06:03] and to god and let him fill our lives
[1:06:05] with his love
[1:06:06] or we will fill the coldness of the last
[1:06:08] day church and reject the truth
[1:06:10] of god which is alone able to help us
[1:06:13] so he's saying here this is it the truth
[1:06:15] of god his word is the only thing that
[1:06:17] can help us is that right
[1:06:19] so we've got us we've got to be
[1:06:20] determined christians tonight we've got
[1:06:23] to be determined to see it through to
[1:06:24] the end
[1:06:25] now what keeps us what knocks us off of
[1:06:28] our determination or what knocks our
[1:06:30] focus away and that would be
[1:06:31] distractions
[1:06:32] is that right and there's so many
[1:06:33] distractions today and especially
[1:06:35] um you look in family life and you look
[1:06:38] in church life and
[1:06:39] and you look at work life and there's so
[1:06:41] many things to distract you you know
[1:06:43] you look at the apps on your phone and
[1:06:44] you see how many apps you have now as to
[1:06:46] where
[1:06:47] used to you know i remember the old
[1:06:49] which i know i say old and i'm only 33
[1:06:52] but
[1:06:52] i still remember the the dial up phones
[1:06:55] it had the cord on it and
[1:06:56] and then i remember the first cell phone
[1:06:58] and i remember it it could almost
[1:07:00] vibrate your house down but
[1:07:02] but you see and you know you could maybe
[1:07:04] text maybe one sentence on it took you
[1:07:06] like four or five minutes to text out
[1:07:07] one thing you know you had to hit the
[1:07:09] one two three
[1:07:10] or the one three times to get to the c
[1:07:12] and then you if you wanted to go to the
[1:07:14] e you had to go to the three and hit it
[1:07:16] three times and
[1:07:17] or maybe hit it one time i can't
[1:07:18] remember but but you had to do all those
[1:07:21] things it was so much harder to be
[1:07:22] distracted
[1:07:23] you know if you wanted to be distracted
[1:07:24] you had to go somewhere but now you can
[1:07:26] pick up your phone and you can be
[1:07:27] distracted within seconds you can be on
[1:07:28] the other side of the world within
[1:07:29] seconds and
[1:07:30] and distractions are things that hinder
[1:07:32] determination and
[1:07:35] and we see in today's today's society
[1:07:38] that most of the people are distracted
[1:07:40] you know i remember the other day i
[1:07:41] forgot my phone and man it was so weird
[1:07:43] just walking around and looking at
[1:07:44] actual people in the face you know and
[1:07:46] and actually walking around and being
[1:07:47] like you know hey how you doing you know
[1:07:49] but everybody's looking down and
[1:07:50] everybody's doing this or doing that or
[1:07:52] they're on their phone or they're
[1:07:53] talking and
[1:07:54] and so you know we see that those things
[1:07:56] will will hinder us or
[1:07:57] those there's a distractions and and the
[1:07:59] world wants us to be distracted is that
[1:08:01] right
[1:08:02] and so we see that you know you can go
[1:08:04] to work and and
[1:08:05] you know it's it's so hard to hire
[1:08:07] people right now there's a lot of people
[1:08:08] who don't want jobs and there's plenty
[1:08:10] of jobs out there for people to give but
[1:08:12] but you look people are distracted and
[1:08:14] and you know i i have the
[1:08:15] i have the firm belief that if you if
[1:08:17] you're able to show up on time and you
[1:08:19] can breathe and
[1:08:20] and do a few odd things you can get a
[1:08:23] job right now is that right i mean
[1:08:25] it's it's a pretty evil easy playing
[1:08:27] field you know and i i kind of was
[1:08:29] thinking the other day if you know if i
[1:08:30] ever get fired i really think it's
[1:08:32] if i just show up on time that's that's
[1:08:34] better than 90 of the people
[1:08:35] you know and so it seems like but
[1:08:37] everybody's distracted well i was late
[1:08:39] because of this i was late because of
[1:08:40] this well i was up late because of this
[1:08:42] and i was doing this and
[1:08:43] everybody's distracted now there's some
[1:08:46] quotes i have for on distraction it says
[1:08:48] you can always find a distraction if
[1:08:50] you're looking for one
[1:08:52] and so you know i really try to do that
[1:08:54] when i come home with the with the kids
[1:08:55] from work and
[1:08:57] and jen's been with the kids all day and
[1:08:58] i really try not to be distracted but
[1:09:00] it's hard for me not to be distracted
[1:09:01] because i've tried not to be distracted
[1:09:03] at work
[1:09:04] so i'm like well i'll catch up on social
[1:09:06] media i'll do this i've got to do this
[1:09:07] i want to get on facebook marketplace
[1:09:09] and find the next thing that i want to
[1:09:10] buy and try to sell and
[1:09:12] lose money on and and so you know i want
[1:09:14] to do all those things but then i want
[1:09:15] to stay focused on the kids but there's
[1:09:17] all these distractions
[1:09:19] but it says you can always find a
[1:09:20] distraction if you're looking for one
[1:09:22] now christopher columbus said by
[1:09:24] prevailing over all obstacles and
[1:09:26] distractions
[1:09:27] one may unfillingly arrive at his chosen
[1:09:29] goal or destination
[1:09:31] so i believe when we can get past the
[1:09:33] distractions and and pass the obstacles
[1:09:35] in our life we can look and we can get
[1:09:37] to where we want to be
[1:09:38] as christians is that right and i think
[1:09:40] as christians we ought not to be happy
[1:09:42] with where we are we ought to always
[1:09:44] want to be a better christian
[1:09:46] you know maybe you say well you know i i
[1:09:48] do things good and this is not me
[1:09:49] talking because i struggle every day and
[1:09:51] and definitely need to be better than i
[1:09:53] am and want to attain to be more like
[1:09:55] christ and
[1:09:56] but maybe you know your your prayer life
[1:09:57] is good your family life is good you
[1:10:00] you know you you've got things in order
[1:10:01] your house is in order all these things
[1:10:03] are going good and the god has been good
[1:10:04] to you
[1:10:05] but you shouldn't just want to stay
[1:10:06] there amen you should want to be a
[1:10:08] better christian amen
[1:10:10] so it says uh the beverly hills says be
[1:10:12] aware when distractions come your way
[1:10:15] you'll know it's a distraction when you
[1:10:16] stop doing what you're supposed to be
[1:10:18] doing
[1:10:19] and you find yourself doing things that
[1:10:21] have no value
[1:10:23] so i think as christians we ought to
[1:10:24] really look and begin to say
[1:10:26] what has value what is what does god
[1:10:28] want me to be doing
[1:10:31] and many times you know we can have
[1:10:33] discussions and and there's discussions
[1:10:35] that you can have that have no value
[1:10:37] and what that means is no matter how
[1:10:39] which way the conversation goes it means
[1:10:41] nothing
[1:10:42] right just like if i wanted to talk to
[1:10:44] caleb about fishing tonight that has no
[1:10:46] value really added to our lives as far
[1:10:48] as
[1:10:49] value added to our families now you know
[1:10:52] i may say that i'm going to go catch us
[1:10:53] some fish
[1:10:54] you know and i'm like jen i'm going to
[1:10:56] go get us some some river you know some
[1:10:58] catfish from the river and i'm gonna
[1:11:00] trotline and jug it's gonna be you know
[1:11:02] fresh catfish and then i show up
[1:11:05] empty-handed
[1:11:06] you know i didn't do anything i may have
[1:11:08] been determined
[1:11:10] but i didn't stay until i caught a fish
[1:11:12] all right
[1:11:13] so if some of you were wondering why i
[1:11:14] wasn't here sunday it's because i was
[1:11:16] trying to fish in the rain all day
[1:11:17] saturday and sunday got a head cold
[1:11:19] that brought no value to my life because
[1:11:21] it caused me to miss church
[1:11:23] all right some of you are like oh i
[1:11:25] can't believe you're telling that but
[1:11:26] hey it happened i did it
[1:11:27] it takes brother ben i'm like it's my
[1:11:28] own fault but i fished all day saturday
[1:11:31] got wet
[1:11:32] cold fished through the night and did me
[1:11:34] no good
[1:11:35] i'm still kind of running have a runny
[1:11:36] nose and stuff from it but it did no
[1:11:38] value to my family they really got no
[1:11:40] fish from it
[1:11:41] but i was determined to catch a fish but
[1:11:43] i put out the trot line friday night
[1:11:45] after work and then the next day it
[1:11:47] rained all night and then the trotline
[1:11:48] at the river come up and so i had to go
[1:11:50] out there and get the trotline and get
[1:11:51] the limb lines and
[1:11:53] and and do all this stuff and no fish on
[1:11:55] it of course and you know then go and
[1:11:56] jug fish and
[1:11:57] well then i get out there and i'm like
[1:11:59] oh man you know it's been a long day i
[1:12:00] was out all
[1:12:01] you know out out at night and it's like
[1:12:03] well i'll go back home and rest then
[1:12:04] come back out and
[1:12:05] sure enough still no fish and caught a
[1:12:06] few small fish on the rod and reel but
[1:12:08] nothing that was substantial in my
[1:12:09] family it brought no value to my family
[1:12:12] all that work now it was good for me to
[1:12:14] get away from people probably and
[1:12:16] and and just enjoy it you know um but we
[1:12:19] see that there's things you can do that
[1:12:20] have no value
[1:12:22] right you know i was away from my family
[1:12:24] i was doing this or doing that and maybe
[1:12:26] i could have been at home and
[1:12:27] and doing more things with them and and
[1:12:28] maybe added value to their day
[1:12:30] but you look at your life and you can
[1:12:32] say you know this conversation or
[1:12:33] talking about this person does it add
[1:12:35] value
[1:12:36] you know are you just talking bad about
[1:12:37] someone to be talking about about
[1:12:39] someone are you actually praying for
[1:12:40] someone or
[1:12:41] or fervently trying to to to be there
[1:12:43] for someone or you just want to find out
[1:12:45] gossip
[1:12:46] we need to as christians to look at our
[1:12:48] lives and say does this add value to the
[1:12:50] church you know does this add value to
[1:12:52] my christian walk does this add value to
[1:12:53] the
[1:12:54] to the church body or to the bride body
[1:12:56] as a whole what am i what i'm doing does
[1:12:57] it add
[1:12:58] value to my life and as a christian
[1:13:01] and i believe as christians once we
[1:13:03] begin to look at that and
[1:13:05] we begin to say and and start to say you
[1:13:07] know is this christ like is it and you
[1:13:08] know the old saying what would jesus do
[1:13:10] remember the bracelets wwjd and
[1:13:12] you begin to look and and you begin to
[1:13:14] say you know if this adds value to my
[1:13:15] life then that's something that i want
[1:13:17] to focus on and that's something i want
[1:13:18] to do
[1:13:19] now in 2012 the average attention span
[1:13:22] was eight seconds and so we've seen that
[1:13:25] it's drastically gone down
[1:13:27] now you look at advertisements and if
[1:13:29] they don't flash something new within a
[1:13:30] few seconds you lose focus and you swipe
[1:13:32] right
[1:13:33] you just keep on going because that
[1:13:34] advertisement did not did not
[1:13:36] did not suit you but you look at the
[1:13:38] average attention span in 2012 was eight
[1:13:40] seconds it's much lower now
[1:13:42] um from the time that i actually did
[1:13:44] that study so we see that this
[1:13:46] age is so unfocused that that that one
[1:13:49] day people persons are vegetarian then
[1:13:51] they're not then they're back to
[1:13:52] vegetarian then they only eat meat
[1:13:53] they're carnivores and then they're back
[1:13:55] to just eating whatever and
[1:13:56] then you see people who are in church
[1:13:57] and they're hardcore they want to do
[1:13:59] everything for the church and then
[1:14:00] they're out and they're gone nobody can
[1:14:01] find them and then they're back in
[1:14:03] and we see that people are so
[1:14:04] wishy-washy they can't stay focused on
[1:14:06] one thing
[1:14:06] is that right and so we know that as
[1:14:09] christians our purpose is to fulfill
[1:14:11] god's worst
[1:14:12] word for first and foremost is that
[1:14:14] right as christians our goal in this age
[1:14:16] is to fulfill his word everything that
[1:14:18] he wrote in there about you and i
[1:14:19] it's our job it's our duty as christians
[1:14:22] it should be our desire to fulfill the
[1:14:23] word of god is that right
[1:14:26] first corinthians 15 and 58 and i'll
[1:14:28] just close up just here in a few minutes
[1:14:29] and he says
[1:14:30] therefore my beloved brethren be
[1:14:31] steadfast and unmovable always abounding
[1:14:34] in the work of the lord for as much as
[1:14:35] you know that your labor is not
[1:14:37] in vain in the lord so i think that's
[1:14:40] one thing as christians we ought to
[1:14:41] remember
[1:14:42] as the bride of jesus christ what we do
[1:14:44] when we serve the lord when we raise our
[1:14:46] hands when we don't feel like it when we
[1:14:47] sing when we don't feel like
[1:14:48] it that is not done in vain god sees
[1:14:52] everything every tear you've cried god
[1:14:54] sees that tonight is that right
[1:14:56] hebrews 3 4 3 and verse 14 for we are
[1:14:58] made partakers of christ
[1:15:00] if we hold the beginning of our
[1:15:02] confidence steadfast
[1:15:04] unto the end so i love that scripture
[1:15:07] there
[1:15:07] for we are made partakers of christ if
[1:15:10] there's that little big word
[1:15:12] if we hold the beginning of our
[1:15:13] confidence steadfast
[1:15:16] unto the end have you ever started a
[1:15:18] project and i know i have many projects
[1:15:20] started it and i've been
[1:15:21] so steadfast the beginning but i slowly
[1:15:24] wither out
[1:15:25] going through it especially if it's a
[1:15:27] honeydew list
[1:15:28] and and jen wants me to build something
[1:15:30] i start out and i'm like yes i can do it
[1:15:32] and about you know day two i'm like this
[1:15:34] is the worst thing ever
[1:15:36] i would rather go be run over by a horse
[1:15:38] or something than have to do this
[1:15:40] and so but as as christians we cannot do
[1:15:43] that our confidence has to be just as
[1:15:45] steadfast at the end as it was
[1:15:47] at the beginning do you believe that we
[1:15:49] must be steadfast we can't be looking to
[1:15:51] the left we can't be looking to the
[1:15:52] right we have to stay focused on christ
[1:15:55] so brother abraham says and look in 1963
[1:15:57] he says you know what's the matter with
[1:15:59] the church is today he says we
[1:16:00] we give up too quick and that's what
[1:16:04] he says that's what's the matter with
[1:16:05] the church is today and i believe in 63
[1:16:06] that's the same in 2021 we give up
[1:16:09] too quick when something doesn't go our
[1:16:12] way or something doesn't turn out the
[1:16:13] way we think it ought to turn out
[1:16:16] we give up and i cannot stand that's one
[1:16:18] of my worst things
[1:16:19] is is when people leave the message or
[1:16:21] they leave the scripture or they
[1:16:23] or they they leave they leave god all
[1:16:25] together and they blame it on somebody
[1:16:26] else
[1:16:28] all i say to those people is you were
[1:16:29] looking at the wrong thing
[1:16:31] right if you leave because someone else
[1:16:33] you were looking at someone else if you
[1:16:35] don't if you if you
[1:16:36] if you leave and you can you can leave
[1:16:38] clean it was never in you
[1:16:40] is that right but if you're looking at
[1:16:41] christ if you're looking at christ and
[1:16:43] what and that deep's calling to the deep
[1:16:45] there's a seed on the inside of you you
[1:16:46] can't leave no matter what anybody does
[1:16:50] amen but when somebody tells you they
[1:16:51] left church because somebody did this
[1:16:53] you just ignore them because they didn't
[1:16:55] have it in the first place they weren't
[1:16:56] looking at the right thing
[1:16:58] they didn't have the seed of god in or
[1:16:59] they may have the seed of god in them
[1:17:01] we're not going to give up on them but
[1:17:02] they've got to come to fruition that
[1:17:04] seeds
[1:17:04] got to have that deep calling to the
[1:17:06] deep is that right
[1:17:07] amen but sorry that just gets me real
[1:17:10] bad when somebody says well
[1:17:11] i just just because what this one person
[1:17:13] did i just can't believe what you
[1:17:15] believed because of what they did
[1:17:16] i'm like you're absolutely right you
[1:17:18] cannot believe it because you were
[1:17:20] looking at the wrong thing
[1:17:22] and as christians we've got to say
[1:17:23] steadfast we give up too quick
[1:17:25] elijah stayed there and he prayed and he
[1:17:27] prayed and he prayed until something
[1:17:29] happened
[1:17:30] and when he felt that little trinkle
[1:17:32] come down in his heart he said i hear
[1:17:34] the sound of an abundance of rain
[1:17:36] he said if men and women in here who
[1:17:38] wants christ or the holy ghost who wants
[1:17:40] to be healed
[1:17:41] if they would just stay there and say
[1:17:43] lord you promised it
[1:17:45] he said and then they fill that little
[1:17:46] trickle say here it is lord i accept it
[1:17:49] something is going to happen man do you
[1:17:52] believe that
[1:17:52] you can't just ask god for something to
[1:17:54] happen expect it to happen in the
[1:17:56] in the snap of a finger but you've got
[1:17:57] to stay there you've got to wait on the
[1:17:59] lord is that right
[1:18:01] and that's the thing in today's age we
[1:18:03] are being trained to give up
[1:18:04] we're being trained to try something new
[1:18:07] but we cannot let that
[1:18:08] into our spiritual life is that right
[1:18:12] now we cannot give up too
[1:18:15] quick if we're fighting a battle if
[1:18:18] we're fighting we want to fight to the
[1:18:19] end amen
[1:18:20] romans 8 and 37 just a few more minutes
[1:18:23] nay in all things we are more than
[1:18:25] conquerors in him that loved us for i am
[1:18:26] persuaded that neither death nor life
[1:18:28] nor angels nor principalities nor power
[1:18:31] nor things present or things to come
[1:18:33] nor hide or death or any other creature
[1:18:35] shall be able to separate us from the
[1:18:36] love of god which is in christ jesus
[1:18:39] our lord and that's saying right there
[1:18:41] no one can talk you out of it because
[1:18:42] nobody talked you into it is that right
[1:18:45] you had a spiritual revelation you had a
[1:18:47] spiritual relationship
[1:18:49] with jesus christ when the holy ghost
[1:18:50] come on the inside of you there was no
[1:18:52] one who could tell you that it was not
[1:18:53] true is that right
[1:18:55] you will be unmovable and that's what
[1:18:57] satan hates he wants us to be confused
[1:18:58] he wants us to be troubled he wants us
[1:19:00] to be distracted
[1:19:01] but whenever god gets someone so focused
[1:19:04] on him satan don't know what to do with
[1:19:05] him is that right but in christ there's
[1:19:08] no confusion there's only peace that's
[1:19:10] why the scripture says it's the peace
[1:19:12] that passes understanding
[1:19:13] when everything around you when
[1:19:14] everything in the world is going wrong
[1:19:16] we as christians we have that peace
[1:19:18] that passes understanding maybe you and
[1:19:20] i don't even understand it but it's that
[1:19:21] peace that christ
[1:19:22] puts on the inside of us when we're
[1:19:24] sealed under the day of our redemption
[1:19:26] but we have to be determined is that
[1:19:28] right
[1:19:30] so we look here and it says finally
[1:19:32] ephesians 6 and 10 finally my brethren
[1:19:33] be strong in the lord in the power of
[1:19:35] his might
[1:19:37] it says put on the whole armor of god
[1:19:39] that you may be able to stand against
[1:19:40] the wiles of the devil for you we
[1:19:42] wrestle not against flesh and blood but
[1:19:43] against principalities and powers
[1:19:45] and against the rulers of darkness of
[1:19:47] this world and against spiritual
[1:19:48] wickedness in high places
[1:19:50] it says wherefore taken to you the whole
[1:19:52] armor of god that you may be able to
[1:19:53] withstand in that evil day
[1:19:55] and having done all to stand stand
[1:19:58] therefore having your loins gird about
[1:20:00] you with truth and having on the
[1:20:01] breastplate of righteousness
[1:20:03] and your feet shod with the preparation
[1:20:05] of the gospel of peace
[1:20:07] and i love that it's a gospel of peace
[1:20:10] above all taking the shield of faith
[1:20:13] wherewith you shall be able to quench
[1:20:14] the fiery darts of the wicked
[1:20:16] and take the helmet of salvation and the
[1:20:17] sword of the spirit which is the word of
[1:20:19] god
[1:20:20] praying always with all prayer and
[1:20:22] supplication
[1:20:23] in the spirit and watching there unto
[1:20:25] with all perseverance
[1:20:27] of the supplication for all saints so we
[1:20:30] see here that we must put on the whole
[1:20:31] armor of god and in the power of his
[1:20:33] might and we must stay steadfast until
[1:20:35] the end is that right
[1:20:37] now the marriage of the lamb brother
[1:20:39] brahman says in 1962 the same way it is
[1:20:41] about divine healing
[1:20:42] god has got the power to heal you if
[1:20:45] you've got the courage to accept it
[1:20:47] he says but you'll fight every inch of
[1:20:50] the way
[1:20:50] so we know that the the courage doesn't
[1:20:52] lie within god he has the power to heal
[1:20:55] you but you've got to have the courage
[1:20:56] to accept it
[1:20:57] and you'll fight every inch of the way
[1:20:59] he says god has an amazing grace to save
[1:21:01] you and he will do it but you'll fight
[1:21:04] every inch of your way he said i've been
[1:21:06] behind the pulpit going on 31 years and
[1:21:08] every inch of that has been a
[1:21:09] fight constantly he said certainly it
[1:21:11] has but we must fight if we must reign
[1:21:13] he says
[1:21:14] so when we find out the bride has to
[1:21:15] make herself ready
[1:21:17] we've got to be willing to lay aside
[1:21:19] every sin that does so easily beset us
[1:21:21] that we might run this race with
[1:21:22] patience
[1:21:23] that is set before us we must lay aside
[1:21:26] our self
[1:21:28] and i'll focus on that we must lay aside
[1:21:30] our self
[1:21:32] and i think that's the hardest thing to
[1:21:33] get out of the way is ourself is that
[1:21:35] right
[1:21:35] many times you know before i come to the
[1:21:37] pulpit i begin to look at everything
[1:21:38] that i have done
[1:21:40] everything that i've done wrong and
[1:21:41] everything that i've done this or i've
[1:21:43] done that and that's the way
[1:21:44] i guess i i get before i preach and and
[1:21:46] i begin to look at all the faults in me
[1:21:48] but i begin to remember that i've got to
[1:21:49] get myself out of the way and it's
[1:21:51] christ that's going to come down and
[1:21:52] speak to his people is that right
[1:21:54] we can't say god you come lay them aside
[1:21:57] for us we've got to do that
[1:21:59] ourselves is that right god's not going
[1:22:01] to come down and lay this aside and lay
[1:22:03] that aside you've got to be determined
[1:22:04] in your life to lay that sin aside
[1:22:07] and let god take full control in your
[1:22:09] life is that right
[1:22:12] amen do you love the lord this evening
[1:22:15] amen we must be
[1:22:16] determined people amen i think that's
[1:22:18] the worst thing to see is someone that's
[1:22:20] really wishy-washy you know and that's
[1:22:23] that's that's one thing i love about my
[1:22:25] wife is she's
[1:22:26] she's been constant throughout her life
[1:22:28] you know i've i've probably been on
[1:22:29] every diet fad and workout fad that's
[1:22:32] been here i
[1:22:32] i change i move around a little bit now
[1:22:34] i'm steadfast on certain things but
[1:22:36] that's one thing i love about my wife is
[1:22:38] she's been the same from day one until
[1:22:40] till now and i love meeting people that
[1:22:42] are that way
[1:22:43] and some of you are that way i've met
[1:22:44] you and i've seen you maybe for for
[1:22:46] 20 years since i've been here and some
[1:22:48] of you have been the same from day one
[1:22:49] not that you haven't grown your
[1:22:51] christian wong but you've been the same
[1:22:52] you've been steadfast you've been
[1:22:53] constant you've been determined
[1:22:55] that you're not going to let the world
[1:22:56] change you you're not going to let the
[1:22:57] world move you from the way that you
[1:22:59] ought to be as a christian you're not
[1:23:00] going to let things that happen in the
[1:23:01] church things that happen in the pulpit
[1:23:03] you're not going to let any of that move
[1:23:05] you and that says a lot about your
[1:23:06] determination
[1:23:07] and your spiritual walk with christ i
[1:23:09] would rather see somebody that's
[1:23:11] determined
[1:23:12] and that stayed on the front line for
[1:23:14] year after year than somebody that's
[1:23:15] shouting somebody that's singing
[1:23:16] somebody that's running around the
[1:23:17] church i'd rather see somebody that's
[1:23:19] been steadfast
[1:23:20] day in and day out day in and day out
[1:23:22] that's stood through the test of time is
[1:23:24] that right
[1:23:26] not that anything of that is wrong
[1:23:27] running around the church or shouting
[1:23:28] and screaming we love those moments we
[1:23:30] love those times and they are
[1:23:31] needed and it's the way we can share our
[1:23:33] victory and and prove to satan that we
[1:23:35] have the victory
[1:23:36] and i definitely don't want to say
[1:23:37] anything against those but i want to see
[1:23:39] christians that come
[1:23:40] back to church after the shouting's over
[1:23:42] amen when the evangelists that can they
[1:23:44] can that can fire us up and the spirit
[1:23:46] of god come and you feel
[1:23:47] so good and you just feel like you're
[1:23:49] invincible but you want to see those
[1:23:50] christians that can last when they don't
[1:23:51] feel anything is that right
[1:23:53] because we don't go based off of
[1:23:54] feelings we go based off of the holy
[1:23:56] spirit in our life we go based off of
[1:23:57] the promise
[1:23:58] that christ has given us is that right
[1:24:01] so we see that to be determined
[1:24:03] in your life it means that you're going
[1:24:04] to be determined and nothing else is
[1:24:06] going to move you nothing's going to
[1:24:07] shake you
[1:24:08] you're not going to be defeated you're
[1:24:09] not going to let satan come in you're
[1:24:10] going to be determined and steadfast
[1:24:12] to the end is that right now brother
[1:24:14] branham says in god perfecting his
[1:24:16] church he says be determined don't be
[1:24:18] defeated
[1:24:18] he says you can't be defeated you're the
[1:24:20] children of god god promised the holy
[1:24:22] spirit to every believer
[1:24:23] he wants to give it to you tonight more
[1:24:25] than you want to receive it
[1:24:27] now he goes on and says and now son of
[1:24:28] david he says he says
[1:24:30] he's talking about brother branham was
[1:24:32] talking about a little bit of his
[1:24:33] testimony here and he says
[1:24:34] remember the lord healed my stomach
[1:24:36] trouble and the devil said you haven't
[1:24:37] been healed
[1:24:38] and i said just stick around and listen
[1:24:40] to me testify then he says if you want
[1:24:42] he said if you want to hear god be
[1:24:44] praised just stick around and listen to
[1:24:45] me a while and he got tired and he went
[1:24:47] on his way
[1:24:49] he said so he will do it the other day
[1:24:50] he tried to give me a bad cold he handed
[1:24:52] it to me and i give it back to him
[1:24:54] he handed it to me again i give it back
[1:24:56] to him and we just fought on it for
[1:24:57] three or four days and finally it went
[1:24:59] away
[1:25:00] he said so there you are just keep
[1:25:01] handing it back to him just don't
[1:25:03] receive it give it back to him and give
[1:25:05] it back to him
[1:25:06] and that's the way you do it just be
[1:25:08] determined hold on
[1:25:10] so we see it as christians if satan
[1:25:12] tries to give you something as the
[1:25:13] famous analogy brother joel 40 does he
[1:25:15] tries to give you a box of rattlesnakes
[1:25:16] you don't want it give it back
[1:25:17] amen is that right brother brahman says
[1:25:20] and i'm just coming to a close here just
[1:25:22] in a second
[1:25:22] 64 in shalom and arizona brother brown
[1:25:25] or in in sierra vista arizona brother
[1:25:27] braham says so
[1:25:28] for the new year be determined to stay
[1:25:30] with his word
[1:25:31] and what's what it's promised
[1:25:34] he said like others elected he said did
[1:25:37] in other days if you feel that you've
[1:25:39] seen the light that's broke through upon
[1:25:41] you and jesus christ his manifestation
[1:25:43] of the great holy spirit in these last
[1:25:44] days
[1:25:45] and remember stay with it just as he did
[1:25:49] he said you are the one he elected and
[1:25:51] what he he said he elected in other days
[1:25:53] like abraham
[1:25:54] when he saw it when he was against all
[1:25:56] scientific proof and noah saw it and it
[1:25:58] was against all scientific proof and
[1:26:00] moses saw it and it was against all
[1:26:01] scientific proof
[1:26:02] he said these smart ages that's gone by
[1:26:05] but the elected who saw it
[1:26:07] stood firm amen amen do you love the
[1:26:10] lord this evening
[1:26:12] matthew 9 20 behold or excuse me no i
[1:26:15] went to the wrong one
[1:26:18] and these people they were determined no
[1:26:19] matter what it looked like they were not
[1:26:21] backing down
[1:26:22] they were not giving up and so as
[1:26:24] christians when we begin to become
[1:26:26] steadfast on the word of god you know
[1:26:28] satan's not going to recognize anything
[1:26:30] but your faith in the word of god
[1:26:32] is that right he's going to know when
[1:26:34] you're bluffing when you don't have
[1:26:35] faith
[1:26:36] if i was up here and you know i was
[1:26:37] gonna say something and i didn't have
[1:26:39] faith behind it
[1:26:40] satan would know that the enemy would
[1:26:42] know that when you pray
[1:26:43] satan would know if you were praying
[1:26:45] from faith
[1:26:46] or praying out of fear or praying out of
[1:26:49] maybe self-motive or self-righteousness
[1:26:51] or doing this or that but satan's going
[1:26:53] to know him
[1:26:53] and when the rubber meets the road you
[1:26:56] know you won't want to be standing there
[1:26:57] without faith in what you what you're
[1:26:59] saying is that right
[1:27:00] so we must be determined as christians
[1:27:03] and as believers of jesus christ we've
[1:27:04] got to be determined to say steadfast
[1:27:07] and to the end until we make that
[1:27:09] rapture is that right
[1:27:10] i mean as the musicians come we'll just
[1:27:12] kind of wind down with this and
[1:27:14] and as christians there's so many things
[1:27:16] that can get us distracted
[1:27:18] and so many things that can pull us from
[1:27:19] the to the left and pull us to the right
[1:27:21] and
[1:27:22] and i think the greatest testimony that
[1:27:23] we can have is that we stand true to the
[1:27:25] word of god is that right
[1:27:27] as a christian you know i i know many
[1:27:30] times i've
[1:27:31] i've failed and and failed over and over
[1:27:33] again and maybe
[1:27:34] i've done things that the that you
[1:27:37] shouldn't do or but remember
[1:27:38] god is bringing you into that perfect
[1:27:40] bride that you're you're coming into
[1:27:42] perfection is that right
[1:27:44] and i think many times this age has
[1:27:46] taught us that if we don't
[1:27:47] get perfected or we don't have
[1:27:48] everything figured out in the first few
[1:27:50] minutes then we're not good enough
[1:27:52] you know if you're not this or you're
[1:27:53] not that when everything's minute
[1:27:55] everything's
[1:27:56] really fast everything happens at light
[1:27:57] speed now and
[1:27:59] and and you look at that and and and
[1:28:01] christ doesn't move
[1:28:02] at the speed of people at what we think
[1:28:05] christ ought to move at god moves in his
[1:28:07] own time
[1:28:08] and that's something you and i will
[1:28:09] never be able to explain we can't put a
[1:28:11] timeline on and say well this is what
[1:28:12] god said this is exactly when it's going
[1:28:14] to happen or
[1:28:15] this is when my life's going to be
[1:28:16] perfect this is what god's going to do
[1:28:18] brother brahma says it would be a fight
[1:28:20] every inch of the way
[1:28:21] but if you're determined and you're
[1:28:22] steadfast god will see you through to
[1:28:24] the end do you believe that
[1:28:26] amen we definitely love the lord and
[1:28:28] just thankful for all that he's done for
[1:28:29] us and
[1:28:30] and just so happy we could come out to
[1:28:32] the house of the lord tonight and
[1:28:34] and and just worship with believers of
[1:28:35] like precious faith and
[1:28:37] uh you know we we we really appreciate
[1:28:40] our pastor my brother ben's done and
[1:28:42] that's one thing you know i you you
[1:28:43] never want to do is when a new pastor
[1:28:45] comes in is just jump up and leave ship
[1:28:46] amen we want to give
[1:28:48] we want to give the will of god we want
[1:28:49] to give the will of the lord time to
[1:28:51] come and show that it's fruitful and
[1:28:52] and see that god has blessed it i
[1:28:54] believe that as a church we've done
[1:28:56] a really good job of that and and god
[1:28:57] has blessed us for that and blessed our
[1:28:59] pastor and
[1:29:00] and and done great things for the church
[1:29:02] here and and we're really thankful for
[1:29:04] what god has done for us is that right
[1:29:06] amen but i believe that's because we've
[1:29:07] been determined we weren't going to give
[1:29:09] up we weren't going to be distracted we
[1:29:10] weren't going to be swayed but we're
[1:29:11] going to stick through to the end
[1:29:13] because we weren't looking at this one
[1:29:14] we weren't looking at that one but we're
[1:29:16] focused on christ
[1:29:17] is that right and i believe god will you
[1:29:19] know a lot of people like to see rewards
[1:29:21] given right now you know you get
[1:29:23] somebody uh you hire somebody new and
[1:29:26] they want to be the ceo within a week
[1:29:27] you know and that's just not the way it
[1:29:28] works and i've had to figure that out
[1:29:30] the hard way because i was that way you
[1:29:31] know i wanted to go straight to the top
[1:29:33] until i seen what the top had to deal
[1:29:34] with and
[1:29:35] and so you know you you look and you
[1:29:37] can't just become this overnight
[1:29:39] god is working he's trying he's
[1:29:40] purifying his gold it comes
[1:29:42] service after service god's going to
[1:29:44] take this this minister and he's going
[1:29:45] to purify us this way and he's going to
[1:29:47] bring this ministry and he's going to
[1:29:48] purify us this way
[1:29:50] and i think as christians we couldn't
[1:29:51] get distracted and say well my christian
[1:29:53] life's not where his
[1:29:54] is or hers is and i don't do the things
[1:29:56] that they do but
[1:29:57] just stay focused on him and he'll see
[1:29:59] you through to the end do you believe
[1:30:00] that
[1:30:01] amen let's just sing that song if we
[1:30:03] could he set me free i believe it's in
[1:30:05] the key of g brother dave if you want to
[1:30:06] come and
[1:30:07] i'll sing a verse or two and then you
[1:30:09] can close out the service if you don't
[1:30:10] mind
[1:30:13] amen once like a bird
[1:30:17] in prison i dwell
