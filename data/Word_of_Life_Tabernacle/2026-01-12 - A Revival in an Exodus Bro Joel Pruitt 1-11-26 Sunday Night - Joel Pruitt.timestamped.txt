[0:01] purpose the Holy Spirit led you here
[0:05] &gt;&gt; God leads even his animal life. Do you
[0:07] believe that?
[0:09] &gt;&gt; Here not long ago you might have heard
[0:11] it in the magazines. I love wild
[0:15] animals. And um I was sitting on my
[0:18] porch with my student ministers down
[0:20] here, Mr. Mercer and Mr. Gold. I the
[0:24] tape boys and they come up there and we
[0:26] talk. was sitting on the porch speaking
[0:28] about last July early one morning coming
[0:32] down the road come an old possum
[0:36] and she was crawling along and come all
[0:40] past four houses that didn't have any
[0:42] fences or gates and come to mind it had
[0:44] a fence and a gate and turned in
[0:47] I said I know anyone knows animal life
[0:50] has studied it aposums blind in the
[0:52] daytime they prowl at night and I said
[0:55] look at her. She's probably got rabies.
[0:58] And uh Mr. Wood here, the book salesman,
[1:01] he had been out in the yard rake in
[1:03] there. So he there's a yard rake laying
[1:05] there. And I took the yard rake and went
[1:06] out throw over the old possum. And I
[1:09] said, "Well, I suppose." I said, "Oh,
[1:10] look. Her left shoulder was all broke,
[1:14] mashed up, been chewed by the dogs or by
[1:16] a car, and I hope this doesn't make you
[1:19] sick, but maggots is all over it and
[1:22] green blowflies." I said, "Poor old
[1:24] things are dying." And I happened to
[1:26] notice and I started to raise that up
[1:28] and she was usually they play possum.
[1:31] But when I raised it up, she took out
[1:32] for the house. I threw it rake over
[1:35] again, a yard rake. And I found out that
[1:38] she there's only two animals in the
[1:40] world that has pockets. That's kangaroo
[1:42] and possum. They pack their little ones
[1:44] in it. So when her pocket let down, she
[1:47] had nine little naked baby possums about
[1:50] that long. Well, the day before that,
[1:53] Leo and Jean and I were talking a piece
[1:55] in the paper where a young lovely
[1:57] looking color girl had given birth to a
[1:59] baby, a illegitimate child. She wrapped
[2:02] it in a blanket and put wire around it
[2:04] and smothered the child to death, tuck
[2:06] it out on the bridge in a taxi cab and
[2:08] dropped it off in the river. The
[2:10] authorities had caught it. We were
[2:11] talking about how cruel that was. And I
[2:14] said, "This mother possum is a better
[2:17] mother being a dumb brute than that
[2:19] woman was."
[2:20] That's right. Got better morals than
[2:22] that woman. And so we were talking and
[2:25] Mr. Woods come up and Mrs. Woods and Mr.
[2:27] Gilmore, he come in. We was talking
[2:29] about it. Soon as I let that possum up,
[2:32] she tuck off towards the house as hard
[2:33] as she could go. And I said, "Look,
[2:36] she's only got about maybe 30 minutes
[2:38] for to live, but she'll spend that 30
[2:41] minutes fighting for those little babies
[2:42] to live. And that woman won't drown
[2:44] hers." I said, "That's real motherly
[2:47] love."
[2:48] So the poor old thing got right up to my
[2:50] steps and toppled over exhausted. So I
[2:54] went there and I punched her. I said,
[2:55] "She's dead." I seen her after punch. I
[2:58] said, "No, she's got life in her." Well,
[3:01] Mrs. Woods, Mr. Woods's wife's sort of a
[3:04] veterary. She was standing there. She
[3:05] said, "Well, Brother Brandham, the only
[3:07] thing to do with her now is is go kill
[3:09] her and kill them little possums." Said,
[3:10] "They're too little to round mouth
[3:11] anyhow. You couldn't put them on a
[3:12] bottle." Said, "You just don't let them
[3:15] suffer." And there was a little
[3:16] possibility trying to nurse that dead
[3:18] mother. And I said, "Oh my, that's too
[3:21] bad." I said, "Kill her?" Said, "Yes."
[3:26] "Oh." I said, "I can't kill her." And he
[3:28] said, I said, "Well, why?" I said, "I
[3:30] don't know." She said, "Well, you're a
[3:32] hunter." I said, "Yes, but I'm not a
[3:34] killer." I said, "I I can't kill her
[3:38] somehow." She said, 'Well, let my
[3:40] husband Banks go kill her. Said, "Go get
[3:43] one of your guns and kill her.
[3:45] And I said, 'I just can't do it. I don't
[3:47] know why. I said, 'You going to let that
[3:49] poor thing lay there in that hot sun all
[3:50] day long like that and that poor little
[3:51] baby is nursing that old milk from her
[3:54] like that and die a death like that? I
[3:57] said, "Sister Woods, I I know you're
[3:58] right, but I just can't do it." So all
[4:03] day it was pretty heavy and around the
[4:04] house, the people coming and that night
[4:06] Mr. Woods come up said, "Now look,
[4:08] Billy, you got to go out and take a
[4:09] little rest." So he and his wife, me and
[4:11] my wife, we talked a little ride and uh
[4:13] we come from there and run over a little
[4:14] old dog and I had him to stop and I went
[4:16] back and picked it up mangy and fleas
[4:19] and lice all over him. And my wife said,
[4:21] "I guess you're going to keep it." I
[4:23] said, "Yes, ma'am." Oh, she said, "Kill
[4:26] that dog, honey." Said, "The thing it's
[4:28] dying anyhow." I said, "I'm going to
[4:30] pray for him." I said, "He's little. He
[4:32] ought to live. Ain't nothing wrong with
[4:34] him." So he's a great big fine collie
[4:36] now. Yeah.
[4:37] &gt;&gt; So, you know, God does that.
[4:40] &gt;&gt; Sure does.
[4:42] &gt;&gt; So, then we find out when we went in
[4:45] that night about 11:00, I throw the
[4:47] lights there. Lady the old mother pawsum
[4:48] stretched out. Brother Wood said, "Well,
[4:50] now brother Brandon, you've hunted
[4:52] enough to know and hunted possums enough
[4:54] to know when the sun went down. If is
[4:56] any that possum is ever going to raise,
[4:58] it would raise." And you know that too,

[34:30] light to my peace.
[34:34] You found me. You freed me. Held back
[34:38] the waters from my release.
[34:42] Oh Yahe,
[34:47] you're the God who fights for me. Lord
[34:51] of every victory.
[34:54] Hallelu.
[34:58] Hallelu.
[35:02] You have torn aart the sea. You have led
[35:07] me through the deep. Hallelu.
[35:12] Hallelu.
[35:17] You stepped into my Eictyp
[35:21] and you took me by the hand and you mar
[35:25] me out in freedom
[35:28] into the promised land.
[35:32] And now I will not forget you. No. I'll
[35:36] stand up all you die. Death is swallowed
[35:41] up forever.
[35:43] By the fury of your love.
[35:47] You stepped into my Eel.
[35:51] You took me by the hand.
[35:55] You marched me out in freedom
[35:58] into the promised land.
[36:02] Now I'll not forget you, God. I'll sing
[36:07] of all you've done. Death is swallowed
[36:11] up forever
[36:13] by the fury of your love
[36:18] for the God who fights for me. Lord of
[36:23] every victory.
[36:25] Hallelu.
[36:29] Hallelu.
[36:33] You have torn apart the sea. You have
[36:38] led me through the deep. Hallelu.
[36:44] Hallelu.
[36:48] You're the God who fights for me. Lord
[36:52] of every victory.
[36:55] Hallelu.
[36:59] Hallelu.
[37:03] &gt;&gt; You have torn aart the sea. You have led
[37:08] me through the deep. Hallelu.
[37:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelu.
[37:55] Take my life and let it be my soul
[37:59] devoted
[38:01] Lord to thee. Take my moments and all my
[38:06] days.
[38:08] Make them in his praise. Take my heart
[38:12] and let it move
[38:15] in spirit and in truth for the glory of
[38:21] your name.
[38:27] With every breath that's in me,
[38:30] with every song and me,
[38:36] let it be a hallelu.
[38:42] In every breaking moment,
[38:46] in every blessing that you give,
[38:51] let it be a hallelujah.
[38:56] Oh,
[38:59] let it be a hallelu.
[39:06] All my hopes and all my fears.
[39:10] Every trial, every tear.
[39:14] In the chaos, you remain.
[39:19] Faithful all the way. Through the
[39:23] victories, through the scars.
[39:26] Let me echo who you are for the glory of
[39:32] your name.
[39:37] With every breath that's in me,
[39:41] with every song and me,
[39:46] let it be a hallelu.
[39:53] In every breaking moment,
[39:57] in every blessing that you give,
[40:02] let it be a hallelujah.
[40:09] Let it be a hallelu.
[40:14] Let it be a hallelu.
[40:18] Let it be a hallelujah
[40:22] but a hallelu
[40:25] to you Godlu.
[40:32] Nothing but a hallelujah.
[40:37] Hallelu
[40:39] to you God.
[40:45] With every breath that's in me,
[40:49] with every song and me,
[40:53] let it be.
[40:55] Let it be.
[41:00] In every breaking moment,
[41:04] in every blessing that you give,
[41:09] let it be a hallelu.
[41:16] Let it be a hallelu.
[41:24] Let it be a hallelu.
[41:38] Amen. Give them another good hand this
[41:40] evening. Amen.
[41:44] Appreciate them getting that all
[41:45] together. Amen. And just appreciate the
[41:47] young people want to sing. Amen. And do
[41:49] it something for the Lord. Amen. Amen.
[41:52] Let's just stand together. Uh let's do
[41:54] uh sing that. so much to thank him for
[41:57] as brother Joel. We'll just go ahead and
[41:59] invite brother Joel out this time. Amen.
[42:02] You're looking forward to the word of
[42:03] the Lord this evening. Amen. Just keep
[42:05] our brother in prayer and just enter in.
[42:06] Pull from the gift of God tonight. Let
[42:09] us speak to your heart. Let's start with
[42:10] that first. Try to start with that first
[42:12] verse.
[42:14] Well, when I look all around and see all
[42:19] the good things God has done for me.
[42:25] Amen. Can you sing it tonight?
[42:31] But his blessings
[42:34] be
[42:39] him. I've got so much to thank you for
[42:46] singing out. I got so much to thank you
[42:52] for
[42:53] so much.
[42:57] You see, you know,
[43:00] so to me
[43:04] now
[43:08] he's done.
[43:11] He has brought me from my soul
[43:15] to thank
[43:17] you.
[43:21] Yeah, sometimes
[43:23] while on my way I need
[43:27] I just stop and say thank you
[43:32] for all you done for me.
[43:38] Someday
[43:40] I'll reach heaven shore. Oh please, just
[43:44] let me kneel once more. I've got so
[43:47] much. Amen. Is that the way you feel
[43:50] tonight?
[43:51] Sing it to him now.
[44:01] Praise him for all you see.
[44:05] He has been so good to me.
[44:10] And when
[44:12] I think of what he's done
[44:16] and where he has brought me from, I've
[44:19] got so much to thank him for.
[44:27] Give him a hand of praise tonight if you
[44:29] love him.
[44:30] How he's happy to be in the house of the
[44:32] Lord this evening. Amen. And if you have
[44:34] your Bibles, we'll go right into the
[44:35] word tonight. How many enjoyed this the
[44:38] message this morning? Wasn't that
[44:39] wonderful? Amen. We just thank the Lord
[44:41] for what he's done for us and and thank
[44:43] the Lord for revival tonight. If uh if
[44:45] you would turn in your Bibles to Exodus
[44:47] chapter 13, Exodus chapter 13, and we'll
[44:51] start with verse 17. Chap Exodus 13 and
[44:55] verse 17.
[44:58] And we'll read through the 22nd verse
[45:00] before you're seated. Exodus 13 and1 17.
[45:04] If you get it, say amen.
[45:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:09] If I had a title tonight, it would be
[45:11] revival in an Exodus. Revival in an
[45:14] Exodus.
[45:16] And
[45:18] verse 17 says it like this. And it came
[45:20] to pass when Pharaoh had let the people
[45:22] go that God led them not through the way
[45:24] of the land
[45:27] of the Philistines, although that was
[45:28] near. For God said, "Lest per adventure
[45:31] the people repent when they see war and
[45:35] they return to Egypt." But God led the
[45:38] people about through the way of the
[45:39] wilderness of the Red Sea. And the
[45:40] children of Israel went up harnessed out
[45:42] of the land of Egypt. And Moses took the
[45:44] bones of Joseph with him, for he had
[45:46] straightly sworn the children of Israel,
[45:48] saying, "God will surely visit you, and
[45:50] ye shall carry up my bones away hence
[45:53] with you." And they took their journey
[45:55] from Sukhoth and encamped in Etham in
[45:57] the edge of the wilderness. Verse 21
[45:59] says, "And the Lord went before them by
[46:02] day and a pillar of cloud to lead them
[46:04] in the way and by night and a pillar of
[46:07] fire to give them light to go by day and
[46:09] night. And he took not away the pillar
[46:12] of the cloud by day, nor the pillar of
[46:14] fire by night from before the people."
[46:16] And you may be seated. And we'll go read
[46:18] uh one more here. And it is uh Exodus
[46:23] just right here. We'll go over to Exodus
[46:25] chapter 14, next chapter there. And we
[46:28] I'd like to read verse 10 through 15
[46:31] there. Exodus 14 and verse 10-15. And
[46:36] when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of
[46:38] Israel lifted up their eyes, and behold,
[46:40] the Egyptians marched after them, and
[46:43] they were sore afraid. And the children
[46:45] of Israel cried unto the Lord, and they
[46:47] said unto Moses, Because there were no
[46:49] graves in Egypt, thou hast thou taken us
[46:52] away to die in the wilderness? Wherefore
[46:54] hast thou dealt hast thou dealt thus
[46:57] with us to carry us forth out of Egypt?
[47:00] Is not this the word that we did tell
[47:02] thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone,
[47:04] that we may serve the Egyptians, for it
[47:06] had been better for us to serve the
[47:07] Egyptians than that we should die in the
[47:10] wilderness. And Moses said unto the
[47:11] people, "Fear ye not. Stand still, and
[47:14] see the salvation of the Lord, which he
[47:16] will show to you today. For the
[47:18] Egyptians whom ye have seen today, ye
[47:21] shall see them again no more forever.
[47:24] The Lord shall fight for you. Somebody
[47:25] say, "Amen."
[47:26] &gt;&gt; "And ye shall hold your peace." And the
[47:28] Lord said unto Moses, "Wherefore cry
[47:31] thou unto me, speak unto the children of
[47:34] Israel that they go forward." And
[47:37] tonight, while I was thinking on this
[47:39] thought here over the last few days and
[47:40] some of the messages I was listening to,
[47:42] I was thinking about they had there was
[47:44] a revival in the time of an Exodus.
[47:46] There was a revival in the time when
[47:48] they were in the desert. There was a
[47:49] revival. Amen. They had to have
[47:51] something uh that would take them out,
[47:53] but also something to sustain them in
[47:56] the time when it would get dry. Can you
[47:57] say amen? Because they would come uh
[48:00] from Egypt where they were able to eat.
[48:03] They were, you know, they had there was
[48:04] a certain security to where they were
[48:06] there in Egypt. Even though they were
[48:08] they were slaves, they were uh they were
[48:10] they were allowed to eat. They were
[48:11] allowed to have homes. They were allowed
[48:13] to to live. And they it was in a
[48:15] routine. They had a good routine. They
[48:17] had a had things they could do. And they
[48:19] they actually got to a point where
[48:21] following God was harder in their minds
[48:24] than serving the Egyptians.
[48:26] &gt;&gt; And I wonder today if we don't get the
[48:28] same way. We think, well, it's just too
[48:30] hard to be a Christian. It's just too
[48:32] hard to It's too hard to live the life
[48:34] that God has called us to live. Amen.
[48:37] But I want you to notice that it says,
[48:38] "Fear not. Stand still and see the
[48:41] salvation of the Lord." Amen. See the
[48:43] salvation. see his saving power. See
[48:46] what he's got for you. And so, you know,
[48:48] when Moses was there when he called him
[48:51] from Israel, brother Brandon would talk
[48:53] about uh Moses being spiritual and he
[48:54] said he understood that God was going to
[48:56] take the children of Israel out and he
[48:58] called him to do it. But now he tried to
[49:00] do it in himself and he said that's
[49:02] what's the matter with a lot of people
[49:04] today. You try to bring healing to
[49:06] yourself. You try to work up your own
[49:08] salvation and he said that won't work.
[49:10] It just won't do it. joining churches
[49:12] and signing papers and putting pledges
[49:14] in. That's not God's program. That's
[49:17] just religion. But that's not salvation.
[49:19] Notice he said he failed miserably.
[49:21] Failed. And he said uh he said here he
[49:24] run in the desert for 40 years while God
[49:26] had him back on the back side of the
[49:27] desert where he married this Ethiopian
[49:30] woman Zapor. And she was a highteer. He
[49:32] said she was a hightempered. Moses was
[49:34] too. So I guess there was a little
[49:36] little trouble on the back side of the
[49:38] desert. And he said, you know, he said,
[49:40] ' Don't turn your wife down cuz she's
[49:41] got a little temper. Maybe that maybe
[49:44] that's your cross. God might have give
[49:46] it to you to kind of keep you lined up.
[49:48] And he said, "Amen." Well, somebody say,
[49:50] "Praise the Lord."
[49:52] &gt;&gt; And he but he said, "Now, we'll balance
[49:54] that to my wife that's giving me a look
[49:56] right now." He said, he said, "Maybe
[49:57] that's your cross." And he said, "Same
[49:59] thing with you women to your husbands.
[50:01] Stick together. Uh God promised to God
[50:04] promised you." He said, uh to stay with
[50:06] it. notice. He said, "I'm a person don't
[50:08] believe in marriage and divorce." And he
[50:09] said, "You know that my brother," he
[50:10] said, "if you went," he said, "if you
[50:11] went at it more prayerfully, there'd be
[50:13] less of it." That's free for you young
[50:15] people.
[50:16] &gt;&gt; If you went at it more prayerfully,
[50:18] there'd be less of it.
[50:19] &gt;&gt; Are you still with me? So, Moses is in a
[50:21] place. He's on the back side of the
[50:22] desert. Can you give me some more
[50:23] monitors up here, please? He said, "If
[50:25] you give," he said, uh, he said, "If you
[50:27] just got here on the back side of the
[50:28] desert, Moses was in a place where he
[50:30] thought everything was he could have
[50:32] delivered the people on his own." You
[50:34] know, at one point he was going to be
[50:36] ruler of Egypt. He could have just taken
[50:38] the people. Amen. He could have taken
[50:40] them just by by natur by physical force.
[50:42] He could have uh Thank you. He said he
[50:44] he could he was standing there maybe in
[50:46] Egypt one day as a as the next in line
[50:49] to Pharaoh and the next thing you know
[50:51] maybe Moses could have stood there and
[50:53] and and and and he could have said,
[50:55] "Well, when I'm Pharaoh," he could have
[50:57] waited 40 years. He could have become
[50:59] Pharaoh and delivered the people of God,
[51:01] but there would have been no
[51:02] supernatural to it. There would have
[51:04] been no God in it. It would have all
[51:06] been Moses. And Moses would have got the
[51:08] glory. Are you still with me tonight?
[51:10] Amen. But they had to go through a trial
[51:12] in order for God to show his power.
[51:15] Stand still and see the salvation. Are
[51:17] you with me tonight? Amen. Because so if
[51:19] you try to save yourself or if you try
[51:20] to heal yourself, you try to work
[51:22] yourself into something, I want you to
[51:24] notice that God is not in that. But God
[51:27] is in the trial.
[51:28] &gt;&gt; GOD IS IN THE DESERT. GOD WAS in the
[51:30] rock. Water. When water came forth from
[51:32] the rock, I want you to notice
[51:34] something. He didn't have to smite that
[51:35] rock. What he had to do was speak to the
[51:38] rock. Speak to your situation and he
[51:41] will bring forth the water. I want you
[51:43] to notice tonight Moses many times when
[51:45] he got it himself, that's where Moses
[51:47] would mess up.
[51:48] &gt;&gt; Come on, sir.
[51:49] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, Moses didn't mess up. He
[51:50] was God's man for the hour. He was a man
[51:52] that made mistakes. He was a man that
[51:54] God chose, but he was still a man." Can
[51:56] you say amen? He was a man that would
[51:58] stand on the back side of the desert.
[51:59] Maybe if you could have seen the home
[52:01] life of Moses, you would have never
[52:02] followed him.
[52:04] &gt;&gt; He was married to a hightempered woman
[52:06] and he was a hightempered man. And maybe
[52:08] if you could have seen how they lived in
[52:10] their home, you would have never
[52:11] followed the man.
[52:13] &gt;&gt; But God hid him from the public. God put
[52:15] him there for a reason on the back side
[52:17] of the desert. But what was it? Moses
[52:19] had to have a revival on the back side
[52:21] of the desert. MOSES HAD TO MEET GOD
[52:23] before he could ever become the
[52:25] deliverer. Are you still WITH ME NOW?
[52:27] MOSES IN HIS CONDITION AS A MAN THAT WAS
[52:30] SITTING OUT THERE BACKSLIDING on the
[52:31] back side OF THE DESERT COULD HAVE NEVER
[52:33] DELIVERED THE PEOPLE. BUT HE HAD TO MEET
[52:35] GOD IN ORDER TO deliver the people. And
[52:38] so when he met God, I WANT YOU TO notice
[52:40] something. It revived something on the
[52:42] inside of Moses. Moses the deliverer was
[52:45] always called to be the deliverer, but
[52:47] he had forgotten what God HAD CALLED HIM
[52:49] TO DO. NOW, no doubt he was a shepherd
[52:51] now. He was on the back side of the
[52:52] desert. He was a family man. He decided
[52:54] maybe this is what God's GOT FOR ME. BUT
[52:57] ONE DAY WHEN HE MET GOD again on the
[52:59] back side of the desert, he remembered
[53:01] THAT GOD HAS GOT something for me to do.
[53:04] And what he had for MOSES TO DO WAS NOT
[53:06] TO just be a shepherd, was not to just
[53:08] be a husband, but was not to just be on
[53:10] the back side of THE DESERT, BUT HE
[53:12] CALLED MOSES TO BE the deliverer. And
[53:15] Moses needed to remember who he was. So
[53:17] there had to come a revival.
[53:19] &gt;&gt; I want to tell you something tonight.
[53:21] Some of y'all, you know, we're in the
[53:22] message of the hour and we start lifting
[53:24] Brother Brandham up and saying he never
[53:25] had to have a revival. Brother Brandham
[53:27] said he had to have revival.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; Are you still with me? WE MAKE A PROPHET
[53:32] SAY, "WELL, HE NEVER HE NEVER HAD BAD
[53:34] DAYS. HE NEVER HE NEVER GOT DOWN. He
[53:36] never had TO HAVE A REFILLING." BROTHER
[53:37] BRANDHAM had to have a filling of the
[53:38] Holy Ghost to begin with, and he had to
[53:40] have refillings.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[53:43] &gt;&gt; He would get down. He would get blue. He
[53:45] would get I tell you what, people that
[53:46] have elevated him to deity and made him
[53:48] Jesus Christ. What you've do what you've
[53:50] done according to the prophet himself,
[53:51] you've made him Antichrist. I'M NOT HERE
[53:53] TO POINT YOU TO A MAN. I'M HERE TO POINT
[53:55] YOU TO A MESSAGE.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; If the people would have followed Moses,
[53:59] they wouldn't have had nobody TO FOLLOW.
[54:01] MOSES WAS following the pillar of fire.
[54:03] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[54:05] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon was was following a
[54:06] pillar of fire. The same one that Moses
[54:08] was following. He wasn't following. He
[54:10] wasn't telling the people, "Look at me.
[54:12] Look at me. Do what I do." Although
[54:14] there was a time in life he could say
[54:16] that.
[54:17] &gt;&gt; There was a time in life he could say,
[54:18] "I've tried to live right before you.
[54:20] I've I've tried to do what I've
[54:21] preached." And I believe every preacher
[54:23] should. Amen. But if you're looking at
[54:25] the flesh of a man, I want you to notice
[54:27] that there might be a highteered man
[54:28] that God called.
[54:30] &gt;&gt; There might be a man that's made some
[54:31] mistakes that God's called. There might
[54:33] be a man that's that's that's done some
[54:34] things that that you wouldn't approve of
[54:36] that God has called and chosen to be
[54:39] your leader.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; Are you still with me now?
[54:42] &gt;&gt; Brother Ray would say it like this. He
[54:44] said now he was he was a sheep herder
[54:46] for his father-in-law way back on the
[54:47] back side of the desert. God always
[54:49] gives something. Uh one day he was
[54:51] walking along while he was a shepherd
[54:52] and he looked over and he seen a burning
[54:54] bush and God always gives something to
[54:56] attract the attention of the believer.
[54:57] So he stepped aside not to criticize,
[55:00] not to analyze, not to pull some of the
[55:02] leaves off and take it down to the
[55:04] laboratory to see why them leaves didn't
[55:05] burn. He stepped to the side of this
[55:07] burning fire. He said reverently he
[55:10] approached it and God said take off your
[55:12] shoes Moses for the ground you stand on
[55:14] is holy ground and that's what it is
[55:16] today. The reason the gifts in the
[55:18] church and the reason the people don't
[55:19] get very much today is because it's it's
[55:22] an irreverent approach.
[55:24] &gt;&gt; Are you still with me now?
[55:26] &gt;&gt; And he said it like this. He said he
[55:28] said they come in and he said they've
[55:29] got a madeup mind. And when you come to
[55:31] God don't just half-hazardly come and
[55:33] beat on the altar and chew the chew
[55:34] chewing gum. That's not the way to come
[55:36] to God. just come as sane and as you can
[55:39] come and mean what you're talking about.
[55:42] God will receive you. Are you with me?
[55:45] And he said, Moses Mo Moses said, "I've
[55:47] seen the suffering of my people. I've
[55:49] remembered my promise." And he said, "I
[55:51] love that God always remembers every
[55:53] promise that he made. I'm going to send
[55:55] you right back down to Egypt." And Moses
[55:57] began to complain.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; Think about it. God's man
[56:03] &gt;&gt; standing there looking at the burning
[56:04] bush. And Moses began to complain.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; Can somebody say
[56:09] &gt;&gt; amen?
[56:10] &gt;&gt; Are you with me tonight? Think about
[56:12] what he was in. Moses was in a time
[56:14] where he needed revival. Moses needed a
[56:17] re Are you with me? Is this right OR
[56:19] WRONG? MOSES NEEDED REVIVAL. MOSES WAS
[56:22] CALLED. MOSES WAS GOD'S MAN. BUT HE GOT
[56:24] ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE DESERT. IT WAS
[56:26] DRY. He needed revival. HAVE YOU EVER
[56:29] FOUND YOURSELF IN A PLACE WHERE YOU
[56:31] NEEDED REVIVAL? HAVE YOU EVER FOUND
[56:33] YOURSELF IN THE DESERT WHERE YOU NEEDED
[56:35] REVIVAL? MAYBE YOU WERE DOING YOUR JOB.
[56:37] Maybe you WERE YOU WERE TENDING THE
[56:38] SHEEP. MAYBE YOU WERE DOING EVERYTHING
[56:39] YOU NEEDED TO DO, BUT YOU STILL NEEDED
[56:41] REVIVAL.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. MOSES WAS NOT LOST.
[56:45] MOSES GOD DIDN'T TAKE SOMEBODY ELSE AND
[56:47] SAY, "MOSES IS NOT GOING to do the JOB
[56:49] BECAUSE HE'S BACKSLIDING." NO. Moses was
[56:52] what was on THE BACK SIDE OF THE DESERT.
[56:54] MOSES NEEDED REVIVAL, BUT HE WAS STILL
[56:56] GOD'S MAN. IF YOU FOUND YOURSELF IN NEED
[56:59] OF REVIVAL, THAT DON'T MEAN YOU'RE NOT
[57:00] SAVED. THAT DON'T MEAN YOU'RE NOT
[57:02] ANOINTED TO RUN THIS RACE, THAT DON'T
[57:04] MEAN YOU'RE NOT THE BRIDE OF JESUS
[57:05] CHRIST, BUT YOU NEED A REVIVAL.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; Are you with me today? I would say
[57:11] today, if the WORD IS NOT STIRRING YOUR
[57:13] HEART, YOU NEED a revival. I would also
[57:15] say today, IF YOU CAN SIT AND THE WORD
[57:17] WILL FALL ON YOUR EARS LIKE DEAF EARS,
[57:19] YOU NEED A REVIVAL. IF IT'S HARD TO SAY,
[57:21] AMEN IN CHURCH, YOU NEED A REVIVAL. IF
[57:24] IT'S HARD TO CLAIM YOUR HEALING, YOU
[57:25] NEED A REVIVAL.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; If it's hard for the YOUNG PEOPLE TO
[57:28] LIVE A CHRISTIAN LIFE, YOU NEED A
[57:30] REVIVAL. IF IT'S, COME ON, CHURCH. IF
[57:32] IT'S GETTING HARD TO GET UP IN THE
[57:34] MORNING AND READ YOUR BIBLE, YOU NEED A
[57:35] REVIVAL. IF IT'S GETTING HARD TO TURN ON
[57:38] THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR,
[57:39] &gt;&gt; COME ON.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; YOU NEED a revival.
[57:43] &gt;&gt; Are you still with me today?
[57:45] &gt;&gt; Anybody else NEED A REVIVAL BESIDES me
[57:47] in the building tonight?
[57:48] &gt;&gt; Anybody else need revival here tonight?
[57:50] I TELL YOU, INSTEAD OF WANTING REVIVAL
[57:52] FOR SOMEBODY ELSE, I NEED A REVIVAL.
[57:55] INSTEAD OF YOU POINTING AROUND THE
[57:56] CHURCH, WE NEED AN INDIVIDUAL REVIVAL.
[57:59] And it'll IT'LL MAKE YOU QUIT
[58:00] CRITICIZING EVERYBODY ELSE.
[58:02] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. IF YOU FIND YOURSELF
[58:04] CRITICIZING, WHAT DO YOU NEED?
[58:07] &gt;&gt; IF YOU FIND YOURSELF DEAD AND COLD IN
[58:09] THE HOUSE OF GOD, WHAT DO YOU NEED?
[58:12] &gt;&gt; If you find yourself WHEN THE WHEN THE
[58:14] SONGS ARE GOING FORTH AND YOU FEEL THE
[58:15] PRESENCE OF GOD AND YOU SIT THERE AND
[58:17] YOU CAN'T RAISE YOUR HAND, WHAT DO YOU
[58:18] NEED? A revival. Come on, CHURCH. I TELL
[58:21] YOU WHAT WE NEED TONIGHT IS A GOOD OLD
[58:23] STERN IN THE HOUSE OF GOD. WHAT WE NEED
[58:25] TONIGHT IS TO QUIT SITTING THERE LIKE AS
[58:28] DEAD AS 12:00 AND REMEMBER WHO WE ARE.
[58:31] CAN WE REMEMBER WHAT GOD HAS CALLED US
[58:32] TO? WE NEED A REVIVAL.
[58:36] &gt;&gt; We know that the word is a revival
[58:38] today. We understand that the opening of
[58:40] the word and and all these things are
[58:42] are the awakening of the bride. We
[58:43] understand that. I believe everyone in
[58:45] the building here tonight has been
[58:47] awakened to the word of your hour. I do
[58:49] believe that you are in an eternal
[58:51] revival. I believe that there's a
[58:53] revival without end. this message.
[58:54] That's what that's what it is. It is a
[58:56] word revival. BUT DURING THE TIME, even
[58:59] when THE PEOPLE WERE FOLLOWING MOSES,
[59:01] THEY STILL NEEDED TIMES OF REFRESHING,
[59:04] which we call revival today. Amen. It
[59:06] was times of revival. They they needed
[59:08] something to eat. What did God do? He
[59:09] sent mana to feed the people. THAT WAS
[59:12] REVIVAL. WHEN THEY NEEDED WATER, THERE
[59:14] WAS A PROPHET in the land who could who
[59:16] could speak to the rock and bring forth
[59:18] water. What did the people need? THEY
[59:19] NEEDED WATER. GOD PROVIDED WATER. IF YOU
[59:22] NEED A REVIVAL TONIGHT, GOD WILL SEND
[59:25] YOU A REVIVAL.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[59:27] &gt;&gt; AMEN. But what we've done today is we've
[59:29] become just like Moses was standing
[59:31] there at the burning bush. He started
[59:32] complaining. I'm not good enough. I'm
[59:35] not strong enough.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; There's not enough people with me. Well,
[59:38] come on, somebody. Not enough people
[59:40] going TO SHOUT WITH ME. NOT ENOUGH
[59:41] PEOPLE GOING TO RAISE THEIR HANDS WITH
[59:43] ME. It's just me in the church THAT'S
[59:45] SITTING THERE WORSHIPING GOD. NOBODY
[59:47] ELSE WILL JOIN ME IN REVIVAL. SO, I I
[59:50] just can't worship myself. The next
[59:51] thing you know, you become cold and dead
[59:56] and indifferent
[59:57] &gt;&gt; and start picking at people. And really,
[59:59] while you're waiting on everybody else
[1:00:01] to come into revival, you need a
[1:00:04] revival.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; It's me, oh Lord, stand in the need of
[1:00:07] prayer. Who needs a revival more than
[1:00:09] me? I need revival.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; I would say for our young people, it's
[1:00:13] time that they experience revival. It's
[1:00:16] time THAT THEY DON'T WATCH THE ELDERS of
[1:00:18] the church sit there and they won't
[1:00:20] raise their hands no more. The cry of
[1:00:22] joy was gone.
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; Do you realize that the Ephesian church,
[1:00:25] how they knew they were dead and cold
[1:00:27] was the cry of joy was gone? I come on
[1:00:30] church WORD OF LIFE. CAN WE just not We
[1:00:33] don't need to lose the cry of joy. But I
[1:00:35] say we need the joy BACK IN THE HOUSE OF
[1:00:37] THE LORD. The pastor said it this this
[1:00:39] MORNING AND AND THE BIBLE TELLS US IT'S
[1:00:42] NOT THAT YOU'VE LOST YOUR SALVATION, BUT
[1:00:44] IF YOU'VE LOST THE JOY OF YOUR
[1:00:45] SALVATION, IT'S TIME WE'RE LIKE DAVID
[1:00:47] AND SAY, "LORD, RESTORE UNTO ME THE JOY
[1:00:50] OF MY SALVATION." IF THE CRY OF JOY IS
[1:00:52] GONE, YOU NEED A REVIVAL.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; Brother Joel, why you yelling at us
[1:00:57] today? I I TELL YOU WHAT, IT'S TIME WE
[1:00:58] WAKE UP. IT'S TIME WE RECOGNIZE WHAT WE
[1:01:01] need in the HOUSE OF GOD. IT'S TIME WE
[1:01:03] QUIT TRYING TO CRY AND START SPEAKING
[1:01:05] THAT WE'RE IN REVIVAL. IT'S TIME WE QUIT
[1:01:08] CRYING ABOUT IT. WELL, I CAN'T GET MY
[1:01:10] HEALING WHEN HEALING'S ALREADY BEEN
[1:01:11] PROVIDED. WELL, I'M GOING TO CRY ABOUT
[1:01:13] MY CHILDREN NOT SAVED WHEN ALL YOU NEED
[1:01:15] TO BE DOING IS speak for your children.
[1:01:17] HE SAID, "WHY CRY, MOSES? SPEAK THE WORD
[1:01:19] AND GO FORWARD."
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; WHY CRY ABOUT IT? SPEAK THE WORD. ARE WE
[1:01:24] IN THE SPOKEN WORD AGE OR ARE WE NOT?
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; MOSES DIDN'T KNOW HALF OF WHAT YOU KNOW.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; Think about it.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; God's man for the hour did not
[1:01:32] understand the word that you understand.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; Think about it. You say, "Well,
[1:01:37] everything was revealed to him." No,
[1:01:38] Moses didn't need to know what you know.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; MOSES DIDN'T HAVE MO MOSES FOUGHT
[1:01:42] DIFFERENT DEVIL. HE SAID FOUGHT the same
[1:01:44] devil, but he fought demons THAT WERE
[1:01:46] THAT THAT WOULD GET HIM. They he would
[1:01:47] maybe he was even complacent on the back
[1:01:49] side of the desert. Maybe he found a
[1:01:51] spirit of complacency. Now, that
[1:01:52] spirit's very much alive today.
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; It's very much alive today. I'll tell
[1:01:57] you what we've got today is we've got
[1:01:59] people I and brother Brandon will get
[1:02:00] pretty plain on some of these messages
[1:02:02] I've been listening to. We've got a
[1:02:03] spirit that is a leodyian spirit. It's
[1:02:06] it it'll lull you to sleep. It is a
[1:02:08] spirit that is actually a lazy spirit.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm not calling people lazy. It's a
[1:02:14] spirit of laziness that gets on the
[1:02:16] people. YOU'RE TOO LAZY TO WORSHIP GOD.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; Are we still here? Are we Are we
[1:02:22] together?
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; WE GET TOO LAZY TO WORSHIP GOD. WE GET
[1:02:25] TOO LAZY. COME ON, CHURCH. I'M NOT
[1:02:27] TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE BEING LAZY. I'M
[1:02:29] TALKING ABOUT WHEN YOU COME TO THE HOUSE
[1:02:30] OF GOD AND YOU DRAG IN AND you don't
[1:02:32] want you don't want to BE THERE. WHY?
[1:02:34] IT'S A SPIRIT OF LAZINESS THAT HAS COME
[1:02:36] ON THE PEOPLE. I DON'T WANT TO WORSHIP.
[1:02:39] IT'S A LAZY SPIRIT.
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; Come on. Preach.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; Well, I tell you what,
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; I'll get run out of here and
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; I'll be gone next week and won't see you
[1:02:49] for two weeks. So, praise the Lord.
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; This is one of those where I can preach
[1:02:52] and leave and you'll love me when I come
[1:02:54] back because you'll forget about it.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said he may. He said,
[1:02:58] "I'm going to send you right back down."
[1:02:59] And Moses began to complain, but he
[1:03:00] said, "Show me your glory." And God
[1:03:03] showed Moses his glory. And then he was
[1:03:04] ready to go. I wonder if we just need to
[1:03:07] see the glory of God today so we can get
[1:03:09] back in this army.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; We need to get in the army in due time.
[1:03:12] It's time we get back on track. Come on,
[1:03:13] church. You know, we start talking about
[1:03:15] a rapture and we've decided that it's
[1:03:17] just not going to happen right now.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; Oh my. COME ON.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; WE'VE DECIDED in our own minds that the
[1:03:25] rapture really ain't going to happen
[1:03:26] tomorrow. Because if it did, there'd be
[1:03:28] more people in the house of God tonight.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; If you really thought the rapture could
[1:03:33] happen in the morning, would you miss
[1:03:35] church on?
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; Think about it.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; If you thought in your heart
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; that the rapture was going to take place
[1:03:41] on Monday morning.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; Would you miss church on Sunday night?
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; No, you wouldn't.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; You see what the spirit is? It's it's
[1:03:50] it's not that we're bad people. It's
[1:03:52] that we've let the world uh we've let
[1:03:54] we've let our eyes get filmed over. And
[1:03:57] brother Brandham called that he said we
[1:03:58] need eyes.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? He said John's
[1:04:02] eagle eye got filmed over. It it could
[1:04:04] happen to Moses. It could happen to
[1:04:05] John. It could happen to our prophet.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; Every one of us can get in a place where
[1:04:10] we we feel like we need revival, but the
[1:04:12] but are we really hungering for revival?
[1:04:14] Do we really want the effects of
[1:04:16] revival? If if something got a hold of
[1:04:18] US AND WE SHOUTED IN THE HOUSE OF GOD,
[1:04:20] WOULDN'T we be okay with that? Would it
[1:04:22] BE OKAY IF WE NEVER CLAPPED our hands,
[1:04:24] BUT ALL OF A SUDDEN SOMETHING COMING
[1:04:25] OVER US AND WE CLAPPED OUR HANDS IN THE
[1:04:27] HOUSE OF GOD? COME ON, CHURCH. I'M NOT
[1:04:29] TALKING THAT'S NOT REVIVAL, BUT IT'S THE
[1:04:31] EFFECTS OF REVIVAL. IF YOU NEVER SAID
[1:04:33] AMEN IN CHURCH AND ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU
[1:04:35] LET OUT A BIG OLD AMEN, I'LL TELL YOU
[1:04:37] WHAT, THAT MIGHT BE SOMETHING ON THE
[1:04:38] INSIDE OF YOU THAT IS AN EFFECT OF
[1:04:40] REVIVAL.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; WHAT WE NEED IS THE EFFECTS OF REVIVAL
[1:04:44] BECAUSE OUR YOUNG COME ON CHURCH. I tell
[1:04:46] you what we need today IS WE NEED TO
[1:04:47] QUIT SITTING THERE and saying, "Well,
[1:04:49] I've got enough religion to make it."
[1:04:51] And I tell you what, WE GET IN THAT
[1:04:52] CONDITION AND WE'RE RUINING a whole
[1:04:53] generation of young people.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; It's what we're doing.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; You say, "What are you preaching
[1:04:58] tonight?" I'm preaching what's on MY
[1:05:00] HEART TONIGHT. I NEED A REVIVAL. I told
[1:05:02] Brother Ben this morning, I saw his
[1:05:04] sermon title. I said, "You stole
[1:05:05] everything I wanted to say."
[1:05:08] Because we need revival. WE'RE WAITING
[1:05:10] ON SOMETHING TO HAPPEN. WE'RE WAITING ON
[1:05:11] A MOVE TO HAVE REVIVAL. WE DON'T NEED TO
[1:05:13] WAIT ON A MOVE TO HAVE REVIVAL. WE NEED
[1:05:15] REVIVAL RIGHT NOW.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; We need revival in the HOUSE OF GOD.
[1:05:19] CHURCH, I TELL YOU WHAT, EVERY SERVICE
[1:05:21] WE COME HERE AND WE MAIL IT IN.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; Do you realize we've got young people
[1:05:25] that could have been saved in that
[1:05:26] service?
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; DO YOU REALIZE THAT THAT SERVICE COULD
[1:05:29] HAVE BEEN A HOLY GHOST FILLED SERVICE
[1:05:31] FOR OUR YOUNG PEOPLE?
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; DO YOU REALIZE SOMEBODY MIGHT HAVE
[1:05:34] NEEDED A BREAKTHROUGH IN THAT SERVICE,
[1:05:36] BUT WE SAT THERE WITH A CRITICAL SPIRIT?
[1:05:38] IF YOU'RE THE ONE THAT'S GOT THAT
[1:05:39] TONIGHT, YOU NEED A REVIVAL.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Joel, I I'm saved. I'm
[1:05:44] filled WITH THE HOLY GHOST. YOU MAY BE
[1:05:46] AND YOU MAY STILL NEED REVIVAL.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, MANY OF THE
[1:05:50] ONES, WE'LL just say it like this just
[1:05:52] for we'll just dramatize it a little
[1:05:54] bit. They come out of Egypt.
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; They're following a vindicated prophet.
[1:05:59] Everything's perfect. No reason to need
[1:06:02] revival no more. No reason to even go to
[1:06:03] church no more. We're following a
[1:06:04] prophet.
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; There's no reason for nothing because we
[1:06:07] got a vindicated prophet in front of us.
[1:06:09] Next thing you know, they get out there.
[1:06:11] No doubt they're singing and rejoicing
[1:06:13] and dancing and we got out of Egypt.
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; Look at us.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; We made it.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; We're following Moses. Moses did it.
[1:06:20] We're good. They get to the Red Sea AND
[1:06:22] THEN THEY HEAR MO THEY HEAR PHARAOH'S
[1:06:24] army coming
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; and ALL OF A SUDDEN FEAR SETS IN
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; AND THEY FORGET WHAT THEY'RE FOLLOWING.
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; FEAR SETS IN AT THE RED SEA AND THEY
[1:06:35] THEY LOOK BACK AND THEY GET SCARED. WHY?
[1:06:37] BECAUSE THE FIRST mistake was looking
[1:06:39] back.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; That's right. They look back where we
[1:06:42] came from. Well, if we're going to die
[1:06:44] here at THE RED SEA, WE might as well
[1:06:45] stay right back in Egypt.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; See, comfort.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; Lazy.
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; It's a spirit that gets on people.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; I'm not trying to be hard to you
[1:06:55] tonight. Maybe I'm preaching just at
[1:06:57] myself.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; And if I am, go ahead and amen and
[1:06:59] pitchfork on me.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; I'm okay with it because I need it.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; The pastor needs it.
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; The deacons need it. The trustees need
[1:07:09] it. Come on.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; Our young people need it. And I got news
[1:07:11] for you. Every one of you need it.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; EVERY ONE OF US need it. WE NEED
[1:07:16] REVIVAL.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; BUT ARE WE SCARED OF THE EFFECTS of it?
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; Think about it. So they get down to the
[1:07:22] Red Sea and the next thing you know,
[1:07:24] they look around and boy, they're scared
[1:07:26] to death. You imagine two million
[1:07:28] people, women and children and all the
[1:07:30] animals. And you think about, man, it's
[1:07:32] just chaos. They're delivered.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; And now they're about to all die. They
[1:07:37] think
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; they forgot who delivered them.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; They forgot the same God that brought
[1:07:43] them out of Egypt was the same God that
[1:07:45] was going to see them all the way
[1:07:46] through. But they forgot and they would
[1:07:49] instead OF GOING TO THE PROMISED LAND
[1:07:50] THAT THEY KNEW ABOUT,
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; they wanted to go back.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; And Moses stealed the people.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; And Moses when he stealed the people, no
[1:07:59] doubt Moses himself thought, I wonder
[1:08:02] what's going to happen now.
[1:08:04] And the Lord had to come and speak to
[1:08:05] Moses. Stretch forth your rod.
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; And I want you to notice that when they
[1:08:10] went through the trial,
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; and every one of Pharaoh's army was dead
[1:08:15] in the sea.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; Every one of them. The sea covered them,
[1:08:19] drowned them all. They get to the other
[1:08:20] side. Now, think about this. They get to
[1:08:22] the other side and there's revival
[1:08:24] again. They're dancing and shouting and
[1:08:26] rejoicing. But you know what it was?
[1:08:28] They finally got through the trial. But
[1:08:30] you know, instead of being scared on the
[1:08:32] other side, if they'd have ever looked
[1:08:33] to who they were following, they could
[1:08:34] have been rejoicing on the other side of
[1:08:36] the Red Sea, too.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; Because they could Come on. Are you with
[1:08:39] me now? DO YOU REALIZE THAT EVERY TRIAL
[1:08:41] YOU'RE GETTING READY TO GO THROUGH, YOU
[1:08:43] MIGHT AS WELL GO AHEAD AND GET READY TO
[1:08:44] REJOICE BECAUSE GOD'S GOING TO BRING YOU
[1:08:47] THROUGH EVERY ONE of them.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; I WILL BE WITH YOU, even in you. ARE YOU
[1:08:51] STILL WITH ME NOW? I'M IN THE MIDST OF A
[1:08:53] TRIAL. REJOICE IN THE MIDST OF YOUR
[1:08:55] TRIAL. I I'M GETTING READY TO GO THROUGH
[1:08:57] A TRIAL. THEN START LOOKING TO THE ONE
[1:08:59] THAT'S LEADING AND QUIT LOOKING TO THE
[1:09:01] ONE THAT'S BEHIND YOU.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. EVERY ONE OF YOUR
[1:09:04] ENEMIES IS ALREADY AS GOOD AS DEAD.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; EVERY ONE OF THEM. WHAT WE'VE DONE IS
[1:09:10] WE'VE DECIDED TO LET THE DEVIL SCARE US
[1:09:12] REAL GOOD. BUT IF YOU'LL FOLLOW A
[1:09:14] VINDICATED WORD,
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; THEN GOD'S ALREADY GOT YOU. ARE YOU
[1:09:18] STILL WITH ME NOW, CHURCH? YOU KNOW, WE
[1:09:19] START CRYING OVER OUR JOB SITUATION. WE
[1:09:22] START CRYING OVER YOUR MARRIAGE
[1:09:23] SITUATION. YOU START CRYING OVER YOUR
[1:09:25] BACKSLITTING CHILDREN. And I understand
[1:09:27] that as humans, WE HAVE A CERTAIN part
[1:09:29] of us that gets anxious AND WEARY AND WE
[1:09:31] GET DOWN and we feel bad and we GO
[1:09:33] THROUGH BAD DAYS. BUT I WANT YOU TO
[1:09:35] REMEMBER HERE ON THIS Sunday afternoon
[1:09:37] that greater is he that is in you than
[1:09:39] the ONE THAT TOOK YOUR KIDS. GREATER IS
[1:09:41] THE ONE THAT'S IN YOU. AMEN. THAN THE
[1:09:43] DEVIL THAT'S SITTING THERE GETTING READY
[1:09:44] TO DROWN YOU. COME ON CHURCH. Do you
[1:09:46] realize those chariots THAT ARE COMING
[1:09:48] AND THE DEVILS THAT ARE COMING AFTER
[1:09:49] YOU? GOD SET THEIR EVERYONE DEAD. IF HE
[1:09:53] DID IT FOR THEM, HE COULD DO IT FOR YOU.
[1:09:56] IF HE DID IT FOR ME, HE COULD DO IT for
[1:09:58] you.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; If he Listen, church, I tell you what,
[1:10:01] IT WAS THE HAND OF GOD THROUGH MY WHOLE
[1:10:03] LIFE. EVERYTHING I DID FROM THE TIME I
[1:10:05] WAS A YOUNG MAN ALL THE WAY TILL I GOT
[1:10:07] MARRIED, I PROMISED YOU I DIDN'T DO
[1:10:08] ANYTHING RIGHT. BUT GOD, RICH IN MERCY.
[1:10:11] BUT GOD SAW FIT TO GO AHEAD AND GIVE ME
[1:10:13] A WIFE. COME ON, CHURCH. I TELL YOU
[1:10:15] TONIGHT, WHAT WE NEED IS QUIT LOOKING AT
[1:10:16] THE CIRCUMSTANCES. QUIT LOOKING AT THE
[1:10:18] ARMY THAT'S CHASING US AND START
[1:10:20] REMEMBERING WHO THE GOD THAT BROUGHT US
[1:10:22] OUT OF THIS MESS WAS. IF HE BROUGHT YOU
[1:10:24] THIS FAR, HE'S GOING TO TAKE YOU TO THE
[1:10:26] PROMISED LAND.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; DO YOU SEE WHO WE ARE TODAY? WE'RE JUST
[1:10:30] LIKE THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; We're just like they were.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; Quit worrying.
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; COME ON.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; QUIT LOOKING BACK AND START LOOKING
[1:10:37] FORWARD.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "WELL, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT I
[1:10:40] went through AS A YOUNG PERSON. MAYBE MY
[1:10:42] KIDS WILL DO THE SAME THING I DID." THEY
[1:10:44] DON'T HAVE TO GO WHAT YOU through what
[1:10:45] you went through. Preach.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; Well, I backslid. I turned my back on
[1:10:50] God. That doesn't mean your children
[1:10:51] have to.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; And if your children DID, YOU NEED TO BE
[1:10:54] HOLDING ON TO A PROMISE AND QUIT LOOKING
[1:10:56] AT THE CIRCUMSTANCES.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; WELL, come on, somebody. YOU OUGHT TO
[1:10:59] PREACH WITH ME TONIGHT. WE'VE GOT TOO
[1:11:01] MUCH FEAR AND SCARE AMONG the people.
[1:11:03] And Moses HAD TO COME AND STEAL THE
[1:11:05] PEOPLE. WE HAVE A WORD TODAY THAT WILL
[1:11:08] STEAL the people.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; It'll say, "Quit worrying. Don't be
[1:11:12] fearful. Don't be anxious about
[1:11:14] nothing." AMEN. WOULD GIVE GOD THANKS
[1:11:16] ALWAYS.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; If you give God thanks in THE MIDST OF
[1:11:20] THE TRIAL AND YOU KNOW HE'S ALREADY, YOU
[1:11:22] KNOW WHY YOU THANK HIM IN THE MIDST of
[1:11:24] the trial is because you know you're
[1:11:25] coming through the trial.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; IF YOU GIVE GOD THANKS, COME ON. YOU
[1:11:29] KNOW, WE WAIT TILL THE TRIAL IS OVER AND
[1:11:30] SO DID SO DID MIRIAM. Moses even got
[1:11:32] through there. Moses got to the other
[1:11:34] side. Miriam got to the other side and
[1:11:36] they were dancing and shouting. Moses or
[1:11:38] Miriam was beating the tambourine and
[1:11:40] Moses was singing.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; They're on the other side now, right?
[1:11:44] and they're having a good time and you
[1:11:46] know all the fear and all the scare was
[1:11:48] gone. LOOK WHAT GOD DID. AND THE next
[1:11:50] thing you know, listen to me.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; The next thing you know, they're in the
[1:11:54] middle of a wilderness and God led them
[1:11:56] the long way. Read your Bible on it.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; God decided to take them on the longest
[1:12:01] path. Brother said they could have got
[1:12:03] there and I forget how many days it was,
[1:12:04] just a few days.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; Three days they could have got to where
[1:12:07] they were going, but God took them 40
[1:12:09] years.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; Come on. Because God knew these people
[1:12:14] needed to go through a trial.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; God needed to get these people to trust.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; God decided to lead them. They were
[1:12:22] following the pillar of fire. But the
[1:12:25] next thing you know, so they see the the
[1:12:27] miracles and the signs in Egypt and
[1:12:30] they're following a vindicated prophet
[1:12:31] to the Red Sea. God shows up and drowns
[1:12:34] the entire army. They're rejoicing and
[1:12:36] happy. And then they're hungry. God
[1:12:39] gives them angel food
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; and they complain about that too because
[1:12:42] it's getting old.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; We don't want that.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; We don't want just the word
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; because it's getting a little stale.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; And they're complainers.
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; Are you still with me?
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; It's a little boring in the house of God
[1:12:56] today.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; We don't even want to show up.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; Some of them decided they weren't even
[1:13:01] going to come out the tent.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; My wife and I fought just like the
[1:13:05] prophet did last night. We're not coming
[1:13:06] out.
[1:13:08] We don't care what God did. We decided,
[1:13:11] you know, we might as well we just been
[1:13:12] we'd been better off in Egypt because at
[1:13:13] least we ate every day
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; and here they are free.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; They've got they've got food that is
[1:13:19] literally coming down from heaven.
[1:13:20] Imagine walking out of your house Monday
[1:13:22] morning
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; and you paid your tithe and that was the
[1:13:25] last bit of money you had and
[1:13:27] Chick-fil-A was sitting on your
[1:13:28] doorstep.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; You don't like Chick-fil-A?
[1:13:36] Shame on you.
[1:13:38] I tell you what, think about it. God was
[1:13:41] feeding them angel food every new every
[1:13:45] morning.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; EVERY MORNING. ALL THEY COULD EAT.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; THEY GO IN AND GATHER up angel's food.
[1:13:51] Sister Alice, ANGEL'S FOOD. GOD is
[1:13:53] raining it from the sky. THEY DON'T HAVE
[1:13:55] A FOOD BILL.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; No grocery shopping, no Walmart
[1:14:00] experiences.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; They've got a vindicated prophet.
[1:14:05] They've seen signs and miracles. They've
[1:14:07] seen more than any of you have seen in
[1:14:09] this building today.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; I don't think there was anybody here
[1:14:12] that actually physically saw the the
[1:14:14] works when Brother Brandon was alive. I
[1:14:16] don't think there is. But I'll tell you
[1:14:17] this, maybe there is. If there is,
[1:14:20] forgive me. But if you saw it, that's
[1:14:22] wonderful. But I'll say this, most of us
[1:14:24] haven't seen that. Most of us haven't
[1:14:25] seen those works done. They saw
[1:14:28] Pharaoh's army drown.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; They saw the plagues come down on Egypt
[1:14:32] and the deliverance happen. They saw all
[1:14:35] these things and they still found time
[1:14:37] to complain.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah, they did
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; because maybe their best friend didn't
[1:14:42] text them that day.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; And maybe,
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; come on.
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; I'M JUST I'M JUST TALKING ABOUT real
[1:14:48] life problems here. You know, Satan will
[1:14:50] tell you that somebody don't like you.
[1:14:52] And really what it is, it's just Satan
[1:14:54] working and trying to get between you.
[1:14:56] What you need to do is realize we've all
[1:14:58] got problems.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; We've all got We've all got opinions.
[1:15:01] We've all got Listen, church, you
[1:15:03] realize, you know, Brother Ben, I'll
[1:15:05] pick on him. Brother Ben was an awkward
[1:15:07] little kid.
[1:15:09] Little kid. He was. And And you know, I
[1:15:12] even went through I went through that
[1:15:14] awkward state. Really awkward stage.
[1:15:15] Nobody wanted to be around me, including
[1:15:16] him.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; And And you know, you get through that,
[1:15:20] you get through a time in life, you get
[1:15:21] through the awkward stage in the teenage
[1:15:22] years, then you grow up. And the next
[1:15:23] thing you know, you're too busy. And so,
[1:15:26] you want to have it's like there there's
[1:15:27] all the time I'm telling my wife, we're
[1:15:28] going to go, we're going to go, we're
[1:15:29] going to invite people over to the
[1:15:30] house. We're going to invite people over
[1:15:31] to the house. We're going to do this.
[1:15:32] We're going to do that. Six months
[1:15:33] later, we haven't done it.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; Brother Joel, you just don't love us.
[1:15:37] Well, the truth is my intentions are
[1:15:39] good. But next thing you know, I I'm I'm
[1:15:42] either gone or I'm here or you know what
[1:15:45] it is. It it sometimes. And then people
[1:15:47] get offended. I get offended too.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; Preachers ain't supposed to. Well,
[1:15:54] everybody gets offended. You know, you
[1:15:57] hear you hear one day of, well, what
[1:15:59] wish you could lead songs, you know, I
[1:16:01] could do a better job than that or
[1:16:02] something like that, you know, and
[1:16:03] you're like, man, kick me while I'm
[1:16:05] down. Why don't you
[1:16:07] you know what I mean? We're all human.
[1:16:08] We all have feelings. We do. Anybody
[1:16:10] else here got no humans in the building?
[1:16:14] All these angels sitting here. It's easy
[1:16:15] to preach to angels,
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; but they don't know what I'm talking
[1:16:18] about.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; But you get in these situations. This is
[1:16:21] the children of Israel. Do you realize
[1:16:22] Moses dealt with people just like you?
[1:16:26] Oh Lord help us is right.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; Uh Moses dealt with people just like
[1:16:31] you. Every one of us has complained
[1:16:33] about something we should have compl
[1:16:34] shouldn't have complained about.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; Walk in the fellowship hall one day and
[1:16:38] the potluck
[1:16:40] and and and we don't like what's there
[1:16:42] and we could change that by bringing
[1:16:44] what we like. You know,
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; man, there wasn't no pumpkin pie at the
[1:16:49] at the at the Thanksgiving dinner. Well,
[1:16:51] you didn't bring one. Will you? Anybody
[1:16:54] else here?
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; What I'm saying is we find ourselves
[1:16:57] complaining about things that we don't
[1:16:58] need to be complaining about.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; Have you ever thought about what God's
[1:17:01] done for you?
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, yes.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; We complain, but if you ever look
[1:17:05] around, Brother David brought me out on
[1:17:07] that song. You ever look around and see
[1:17:08] all the blessings that he's given you?
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord.
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; Anybody here got a child that's with
[1:17:13] them today in the building?
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; If you got a child here, you're blessed.
[1:17:17] If you got a spouse here, you're
[1:17:18] blessed.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. If you're sitting in
[1:17:21] the house OF GOD TODAY, YOU'RE BLESSED
[1:17:22] TO be here.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; DO YOU REALIZE WHO WE ARE? WE'RE A
[1:17:25] BLESSED PEOPLE. LIFE HAPPENS. LOTS OF
[1:17:28] THINGS ARE GOING TO GO WRONG. THERE'S
[1:17:29] GOING TO BE A PLENTY OF THINGS TO
[1:17:30] COMPLAIN ABOUT. BUT WHY DON'T WE QUIT
[1:17:32] COMPLAINING AND START THANKING GOD FOR
[1:17:34] WHAT HE'S DONE? LORD, YOU BROUGHT ME
[1:17:36] FROM A MIGHTY LONG WAY. LORD, YOU PICK
[1:17:38] ME UP THIS MORNING. YOU WOKE ME UP.
[1:17:40] THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH TO THANK YOU FOR IT.

[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; YES, I MIGHT BE DEALING WITH ALL KINDS
[1:17:44] OF PAIN. YES, I MIGHT HAVE SICKNESS IN

[1:20:04] THEY'RE STILL FIGHTING? WHY WHY IS IT
[1:20:06] THAT I CAN'T SEEM TO GET THE
[1:20:07] BREAKTHROUGH THAT I WANT?
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; OH MY. Come on.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; PREACHERS NEED BREAKTHROUGHS, TOO.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; PREACHERS NEED PREACHERS NEED
[1:20:14] REFILLINGS, TOO.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; PREACHERS AIN'T ANGELS. PREACHERS NEED
[1:20:18] COME ON, SOMEBODY.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; Anybody else? You know, WE START LIFTING
[1:20:22] EACH OTHER. WE START PUTTING EACH OTHER
[1:20:23] UP HERE. WELL, I'M STRUGGLING. DON'T
[1:20:25] TOUCH MY SITUATION, BUT THESE PEOPLE
[1:20:26] OVER HERE NEED TO BE BETTER. THEY'RE
[1:20:28] GOING THROUGH STUFF, TOO.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; Come on, preach.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; Why can't they help me? Why can't they
[1:20:33] do something for me? They're they're
[1:20:34] good, solid Christians. And you don't
[1:20:35] know the demons they're fighting on the
[1:20:37] inside.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; Come on, preach.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; Moses was fighting these devils, too.
[1:20:44] Moses is standing there trying to stand
[1:20:45] in the breach of the people, saying,
[1:20:47] "Lord, don't don't hurt the people.
[1:20:49] Don't hurt the people. I I I'll stand
[1:20:51] for them." He stood for the people so
[1:20:53] long.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; And he and he and he DIDN'T WANT GOD TO
[1:20:56] TAKE THE PEOPLE OUT BECAUSE HE CARED FOR
[1:20:57] THE PEOPLE. LOVED THE PEOPLE SO MUCH
[1:20:59] THAT MOSES FINALLY GOT TO A POINT AND
[1:21:02] LISTEN CHURCH, THEY TRIED TO MAKE AN
[1:21:04] IDOL AT ONE POINT. THEY THEY DECIDED,
[1:21:06] YOU KNOW WHAT? WE'RE JUST GOING TO WE'RE
[1:21:08] just going to we're just going to get
[1:21:09] all the gold.
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; You know, the first they had they they
[1:21:12] did have a good idea to get rid of all
[1:21:13] the jewelry and the earrings.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; But they got it all and then they
[1:21:16] decided to make a big golden calf and
[1:21:19] worship that. These are listen, they had
[1:21:21] seen the hand of God.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; These people knew what God was and what
[1:21:26] God could do. And the next thing you
[1:21:28] know, just like it natural Christians
[1:21:30] will do, you'll make an idol out of
[1:21:32] something that you have no business
[1:21:34] making an idol out of.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; Moses is RIGHT THERE.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; JUST BECAUSE HE went up on the mountain
[1:21:39] for a few days, DON'T START TURNING YOUR
[1:21:41] BACK AND SAY, "WELL, WE'RE GOING TO
[1:21:43] START MAKING IDOLS. WE GOT TO START
[1:21:44] DOING SOMETHING DIFFERENT." NO. WHY
[1:21:45] DON'T YOU JUST KEEP FOLLOWING THE WORD
[1:21:47] THAT MOSES PREACHED?
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. I TELL YOU WHAT, I'M
[1:21:51] NOT GOING TO STOP AND START MAKING AN
[1:21:52] IDOL OUT OF SOMETHING IN THIS MESSAGE
[1:21:54] WHEN I'M JUST GOING TO KEEP FOLLOWING
[1:21:55] THE SAME LIVING GOD THAT THE MESSENGER
[1:21:58] OF THE HOUR PREACHED AND POINTED ME TO.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; LORD,
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; you see what we can do as people, we
[1:22:02] decide, well, our leader gone. We've got
[1:22:04] to start making something else. We got
[1:22:07] to worship something.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; We all do.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; The per the quietest person in the
[1:22:13] building worships every day.
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; You do. You worship something. You might
[1:22:19] get up. Come on.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; And you worship the car that you have.
[1:22:22] You worship the job that you have. If
[1:22:24] your job is ever above anything that God
[1:22:28] has for you, think about it. It's an
[1:22:31] idol.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; And we've been put we've been put in a
[1:22:34] situation in life where it's hard. Are
[1:22:38] anybody with me today?
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; Wednesday nights are hard on people. I
[1:22:40] know we have jobs. We have obligations.
[1:22:42] We have things.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; But did you ever read the Bible where if
[1:22:45] you put God first, God will bless you?
[1:22:48] Sir,
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; you know, you know why we don't take
[1:22:50] that and apply it to ourselves? Because
[1:22:52] we don't really believe that God would
[1:22:53] take care of us
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; if we put him first.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; What we need is revival.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; I've only got 10 minutes left. So, if
[1:23:04] you just be bear with me, we'll be okay.
[1:23:05] I'm I'm going to skip way down here.
[1:23:07] Okay. Brother Ram said, "Now, it's
[1:23:09] almost an impossible thing to get people
[1:23:10] praying, fasting, calling on the Lord.
[1:23:12] Seems like the church has got so drowsy
[1:23:15] and lazy in these last days. So pitiful.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; You thought I was calling you lazy. I
[1:23:20] was using a quote.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; So pitiful. He said,
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; he said, "And I hate to come and just
[1:23:27] keep stirring and preaching and saying
[1:23:29] these things, but brother, sister,
[1:23:31] that's the truth. I just can't hold it.
[1:23:33] It's the gospel and it must be preached.
[1:23:37] IT'S GOT TO BE PREACHED AS A WITNESS.
[1:23:39] It's true."
[1:23:41] Are you with me today? There's a prophet
[1:23:43] telling you, "I LISTEN, I'M NOT TRYING
[1:23:44] TO MAKE THESE THINGS UP. I'M NOT BE
[1:23:46] TRYING TO BE HARD ON YOU. I'M TELLING
[1:23:47] YOU, I NEED THIS AS MUCH AS YOU need
[1:23:49] this. Every one OF US NEED A REVIVAL.
[1:23:52] WE'VE BEEN IN A DESERT PLACE. WE'VE BEEN
[1:23:54] IN A WILDERNESS JOURNEY. WE'RE ON A
[1:23:55] JOURNEY TO OUR PROMISED LAND. BUT I WANT
[1:23:57] YOU TO KNOW SOMETHING THAT IF THE HOLY
[1:23:59] GHOST IS ON THE INSIDE OF YOU, THEN THE
[1:24:01] POTENTIALS OF REVIVAL IS ALREADY THERE.
[1:24:04] IF THE HOLY GHOST HAS ALREADY COME AND
[1:24:06] HAS MADE ITS HOME ON THE INSIDE OF YOU,
[1:24:08] THEN I GO AHEAD AND TELL YOU SOMETHING.
[1:24:10] YOU'RE ALREADY POTENTIALLY IN THE
[1:24:11] PROMISED LAND. IT'S TIME WE QUIT
[1:24:13] FUSSING, FIGHTING, AND LOOKING AT THE
[1:24:15] CIRCUMSTANCES AND TAKE GOD AT HIS WORD
[1:24:18] AND KEEP MOVING FORWARD.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; And the way we do THAT IS TO QUIT
[1:24:22] LOOKING. BROTHER SAID, NOW he he said,
[1:24:24] "Listen," he said, "I was walking down
[1:24:25] the street one day and the Holy Ghost
[1:24:26] just blessed me." He's talking about a
[1:24:28] brother here. He said, "Brother, that's
[1:24:29] true. I can't hold it." He said, "I
[1:24:31] think that we just presume too much. We
[1:24:33] we presume because we had an experience
[1:24:35] five years ago, brother Brandham. I was
[1:24:36] walking down the street one day and the
[1:24:38] Holy Ghost just blessed me. And I run
[1:24:39] down the street. I thought, Lord, you
[1:24:40] have to take take me somewhere because
[1:24:42] I'm going to misbehave on the street.
[1:24:44] Maybe you were out in the church and you
[1:24:45] got an experience. You spoke with
[1:24:46] tongues and think, well, that's all
[1:24:48] right. I can GO AHEAD NOW. OKAY, I see
[1:24:50] the rest of them doing this. You're just
[1:24:51] presuming that Israel had those
[1:24:53] experiences. Israel had come out of
[1:24:55] Egypt. Israel had seen signs and
[1:24:57] miracles and wonders all along their
[1:24:59] road. They had passed through the Red
[1:25:01] Sea as on dry land. They seen mana fall
[1:25:03] out of the heaven every night. They were
[1:25:05] witnessing the blessings OF GOD UPON
[1:25:06] THEIR LIFE. BUT WHEN THEY FAILED to
[1:25:08] disobey to obey God's commandments, what
[1:25:11] happened? The blessings got cut off from
[1:25:13] them. AND THEY PRESUMED THAT BECAUSE GOD
[1:25:15] HAD BEEN SO GOOD, he'd just be go on and
[1:25:18] be GOOD ON. BUT GOD CAN'T DO THAT. I
[1:25:20] THINK WE'VE COME TO THAT SPOT. WE'VE
[1:25:22] COME TO A CADISH BARIA WHERE GOD has
[1:25:24] given the issue for the church to call
[1:25:25] to a halt AND BACK TO PRAYER LIFE, BACK
[1:25:28] to a consecration, back to A SPOT THAT
[1:25:30] WE consecrate ourselves away from the
[1:25:32] things of the world and away from our
[1:25:33] little petty differences AMONG US AND
[1:25:35] GET BACK TO GOD AND BROTHERLY love and
[1:25:37] humility. BACK TO THE POWER OF GOD
[1:25:40] AGAIN. SEE, COME ON, CHURCH. YOU SEE
[1:25:42] WHAT A PROPHET IS SAYING? WE NEED TO
[1:25:44] HEAR THESE THINGS AND QUIT LOOKING
[1:25:46] AROUND AT THE PROBLEMS. GET BACK TO THE
[1:25:48] BLESSINGS OF GOD AGAIN. YOU THINK, come
[1:25:51] on, church. I I want to get this to you
[1:25:53] as as best I know how today. I I know
[1:25:55] this is cut up. Brother Brandham said it
[1:25:57] like this. We find out along this road
[1:25:58] after they got this they got to a place
[1:26:00] of Horb. And we find out, let's break
[1:26:01] the name down. He said, "That's where
[1:26:03] the name Horb means a dry place or a
[1:26:04] desert. And when they get out of
[1:26:06] fellowship with one another or in the
[1:26:08] church and out of fellowship with the
[1:26:09] Holy Spirit, it brings us to a dry
[1:26:11] place, a desert. Nothing alive.
[1:26:14] Everything's got stickers on it." See, a
[1:26:16] desert, a little piece of cactus with a
[1:26:18] sticker on it. Do you know what it is?
[1:26:19] That's a precious little tender leaf
[1:26:21] that hasn't had no water.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? YOU'RE A SOMETIMES
[1:26:26] THE STICKIEST NATURATURED PERSON IN THE
[1:26:27] CHURCH IS A PRECIOUS LITTLE LEAF THAT
[1:26:29] NEEDS SOME water of the Holy Ghost. COME
[1:26:31] ON, CHURCH. I'M NOT TELLING YOU YOU'RE
[1:26:32] NOT SAVED, BUT WE NEED A REVIVAL.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; Every one of us, IF THERE'S A STICKINESS
[1:26:38] IN YOUR NATURE, YOU NEED A REVIVAL. IF
[1:26:40] YOU'RE COMPLAINING ABOUT THE PASTOR,
[1:26:42] ABOUT THE DEACONS, ABOUT THE SONG
[1:26:43] LEADERS, ABOUT THE MUSICIANS, ABOUT
[1:26:45] ABOUT THE OTHER CHURCH MEMBERS, ABOUT
[1:26:46] THE YOUNG PEOPLE, IT'S TIME WE COME BACK
[1:26:49] AND HAD A REVIVAL. COME ON, SOMEBODY.
[1:26:51] WHAT WE NEED HERE AT WORD OF LIFE
[1:26:53] TABERNACLE IS NOT TO ANALYZE AND AND
[1:26:55] LOOK AT ALL THE OTHER CHURCHES. WELL, IF
[1:26:57] WE COULD BE LIKE THEM OR if they could
[1:26:58] be like us or if we could change THIS OR
[1:27:00] CHANGE THAT. IT'S TIME THAT WE HAVE A
[1:27:02] REVIVAL. IT'S TIME OUR YOUNG PEOPLE
[1:27:04] DECIDE THAT I'M NOT GOING TO GO AFTER
[1:27:06] THE THINGS OF THE WORLD, BUT I'M GOING
[1:27:07] TO SURRENDER IN THE HOUSE OF GOD. I NEED
[1:27:10] A REVIVAL.
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; I THINK the ministry needs a revival. I
[1:27:14] think the deacons need a revival. Come
[1:27:16] on, church. I think the the sisters and
[1:27:18] the brothers need a revival. I think our
[1:27:20] young men need a revival. I THINK OUR
[1:27:21] YOUNG SISTERS NEED A REVIVAL. I THINK
[1:27:23] THE OLD MEN AND THE OLD WOMEN I THINK
[1:27:25] THEY NEED A REVIVAL. COME ON, CHURCH.
[1:27:27] YOU SAY, "WHY YOU KEEP SAYING IT?" CUZ
[1:27:28] MAYBE EVENTUALLY WE'LL GET IT. WE NEED A
[1:27:30] REVIVAL.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; We It's NOT JUST A WORD. REVIVE US AGAIN
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; AND AGAIN AND AGAIN. AND WE NEED
[1:27:39] REVIVAL.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, in a teaching service
[1:27:45] that don't feel good." It's a revival
[1:27:47] because it's the word.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; See,
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; what we think of revival
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; is screaming, shouting, jumping.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; I do believe that's evidence that
[1:27:55] something may have happened on the
[1:27:56] inside. Some people, not everybody
[1:27:59] jumps, not everybody shouts, not
[1:28:01] everybody screams, not everybody
[1:28:02] hollers. But I will say this, when the
[1:28:05] word is preached or taught to the
[1:28:07] people,
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; there will be a response in the heart of
[1:28:10] the believer.
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; And the real revival is going to come on
[1:28:12] Monday morning.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; And then when the revival happens at
[1:28:18] home, it'll come to the house of God.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; See, when you get your home life in
[1:28:23] revival, then the church won't look so
[1:28:25] dead to you. It'll be in revival, too.
[1:28:27] Why? Because you're in it.
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; Come on, preach.
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; Are you still with me tonight? Well, I
[1:28:34] would be in revival if everybody else
[1:28:36] was in revival. Trust me, as a preacher,
[1:28:38] I wish I could say that, too.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; Because it's easier to preach when the
[1:28:42] church is just on top of the world.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; It is. It re it really is.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; I mean, you just say anything out of the
[1:28:47] Bible, anything out of the message, and
[1:28:48] the people say, "Amen."
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; But then the people go through a dry
[1:28:52] spell. No, I I I feel sorry for Moses.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; He stood there and he's preaching to two
[1:28:56] million people, and they're all
[1:28:57] complaining. And you know, complainers,
[1:28:59] it it it spreads like a disease.
[1:29:04] It spreads like a disease because the
[1:29:05] first person complains and then they
[1:29:06] complain to somebody else in the church
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; about something that the other person
[1:29:09] don't need to even hear about
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; and they complain and this one complains
[1:29:12] and that one complain and then next
[1:29:13] thing you know the complaining has is
[1:29:15] like a wildfire.
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; You know, if you'd start telling your
[1:29:19] blessings to everybody in the church,
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; come on.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; That spread like wildfire, too.
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; Look what the Lord's done for me. The
[1:29:25] Lord healed me. He saved me. He
[1:29:26] delivered me. He He brought my children
[1:29:28] back. Come on, somebody. You say, "Well,
[1:29:30] it hadn't happened yet." Start
[1:29:31] confessing it and it will.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; You realize that we have not because we
[1:29:34] ask not. It's time we quit crying about
[1:29:36] it and speak for it.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; Anybody else with me here tonight? It's
[1:29:41] time we quit crying about it and say,
[1:29:43] "Lord, I know we're going to be in
[1:29:45] revival.
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; I know I'M IN REVIVAL. I KNOW I'M
[1:29:48] HEALED. I KNOW I'M SAVED. I KNOW I'M ONE
[1:29:50] OF YOURS." DO YOU REALIZE WHERE WE'RE
[1:29:51] AT, CHURCH? WE MIGHT BE IN A DESERT
[1:29:53] SOMETIMES IN OUR FLESH. AMEN. BUT WE
[1:29:55] NEED OUR SOULS TO BE IN REVIVAL. JUST
[1:29:58] BECAUSE YOU DON'T FEEL GOOD DON'T MEAN
[1:30:00] YOU AIN'T IN REVIVAL.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; Just because the church the church may
[1:30:05] go through things, you know, as a body
[1:30:06] of people when we see loss like we saw
[1:30:09] our sister Cletus that passed away. The
[1:30:11] the entire church can feel that
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; and you feel the you you feel the
[1:30:15] effects of the loss,
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; but you don't you don't say, "Well, she
[1:30:19] wasn't healed, so we're just going to
[1:30:20] No, she's got her ultimate healing.
[1:30:22] Sister Clelet is where right now every
[1:30:24] one of us are wanting to go.
[1:30:26] Every one of us are going to go there. I
[1:30:28] I tell you what, no doubt she's going to
[1:30:29] line up and there's not going to be a
[1:30:31] walker. There's not going to Come on,
[1:30:32] somebody. She's going to stand there in
[1:30:34] a young body going to Brother JT, when
[1:30:36] you see her, you might even have to be
[1:30:38] reintroduced to her.
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; You realize I'm not trying TO MAKE
[1:30:42] LIGHT. WHAT I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU IS
[1:30:44] it's a reality.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; We start LOOKING AT THE DEATH. WE START
[1:30:47] LOOKING AT THE PROBLEMS. WE START
[1:30:48] LOOKING AT THE ARE YOU WITH ME NOW? WE
[1:30:50] START LOOKING AT EVERYTHING NEGATIVE
[1:30:52] BECAUSE WE'RE IN A NEGATIVE WORLD. BUT
[1:30:54] IF YOU EVER LOOK TO THE PROMISES OF GOD,
[1:30:55] THEN YOU'LL SEE THAT THE PROMISES ARE
[1:30:58] GREATER THAN THE NEGATIVITY.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; IF YOU EVER LOOK TO THE HEALING POWER OF
[1:31:02] GOD, IT'S GREATER THAN ANY DISEASE THAT
[1:31:04] CAN GET A HOLD OF YOU. IT'S GREATER THAN
[1:31:05] HEART DISEASE. IT'S GREATER THAN CANCER.
[1:31:08] WE DON'T FEAR IT BECAUSE OUR GOD IS
[1:31:10] BIGGER AND HE'S MORE POWERFUL.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; That's why he's greater than a He's
[1:31:14] greater than the army that's pursuing
[1:31:15] you. If there's a devil after you, our
[1:31:18] God is greater.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; All right?
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? If there's a IF
[1:31:21] THERE'S A DISEASE ON YOU, OUR GOD IS
[1:31:23] GREATER. IF YOU'RE IN NEED OF FOOD, OUR
[1:31:26] GOD CAN SUPPLY ALL YOUR NEEDS. HE'S DONE
[1:31:28] IT FOR THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. HE'S DONE
[1:31:30] IT WITH LISTEN, HE DID IT IN JESUS'S
[1:31:32] TIME. The little boy with the WITH THE
[1:31:34] WITH THE FISH AND LOAVES. HE STOOD
[1:31:35] THERE, DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH FOR JUST MAYBE
[1:31:37] ONE LITTLE INDIVIDUAL, AND HE COULD FEED
[1:31:39] 5,000 PLUS THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN.
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; Think about it.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; AND YOU SAY GOD CAN'T SUPPLY FOR ONE
[1:31:47] PERSON. GOD CAN SUPPLY FOR EVERY PERSON.
[1:31:50] GOD HAS GOT YOU IN THE PALMS OF HIS
[1:31:52] HAND. DO YOU REALIZE THAT WHEN YOU'RE
[1:31:54] GOING THROUGH A TRIAL, THINK ABOUT THIS
[1:31:56] before we close.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; You're going through the worst trial of
[1:31:58] your life. I don't care if it's
[1:31:59] financial. I don't care if it's sick. I
[1:32:01] do care. But whether it be financial
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; or sickness,
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; whether it's with your family, whether
[1:32:08] it's with your prayer life,
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; whatever it is
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; that has caused you problems, whatever
[1:32:14] it is that is causing you gloom and
[1:32:16] despair
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; and ALL THESE BAD THINGS, WHATEVER IT
[1:32:20] IS, if you ever step back one time
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; and think that God is holding you just
[1:32:26] like this
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; and he sees every problem,
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; he knows every situation you're in,
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; and he already knows knows HOW YOU'RE
[1:32:33] GOING TO GET OUT of it.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; You don't need to know. GOD WILL TELL
[1:32:36] YOU WHEN YOU NEED TO KNOW. MAYBE GOD
[1:32:38] DON'T WANT TO TELL YOU, BUT BECAUSE
[1:32:39] MAYBE THERE'S A PROBLEM COMING THAT YOU
[1:32:41] DON'T THINK YOU COULD GET THROUGH, BUT
[1:32:42] HE'S ALREADY MADE A WAY. AND IF HE MAKES
[1:32:44] A WAY WHERE THERE IS NO COME ON,
[1:32:46] SOMEBODY SPEAK TO YOUR MOUNTAIN THIS
[1:32:48] MORNING. YOU YOU YOU OR THIS AFTERNOON,
[1:32:51] SPEAK TO YOUR MOUNTAIN. SPEAK TO YOUR
[1:32:52] CIRCUMSTANCE. IT'S TIME TO SPEAK AND GO
[1:32:54] FORWARD. WE WE'VE STAYED IN THE
[1:32:57] WILDERNESS LONG ENOUGH AND WE'VE WENT
[1:32:58] CIRCLE AFTER CIRCLE AND WE'VE COMPASSED
[1:33:01] THIS MOUNTAIN AND WE'VE DECIDED THAT
[1:33:02] MAYBE THIS IS MY DESTINY IS JUST A
[1:33:04] WILDERNESS JOURNEY. NO, GOD'S GOT A
[1:33:06] PROMISED LAND.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; WHAT HE NEEDS IS SOME JOSHUA AND CALEB'S
[1:33:10] TO GET READY TO GO OVER.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; Because when he can get a couple people
[1:33:14] that are in unity
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; with the word of God, then we're going
[1:33:19] over across the Red Sea.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; We're going across the Jordan. Right.
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham talks about our our
[1:33:25] promised land. And I'll try to get this
[1:33:27] and we'll quit. Uh, Brother Stewart,
[1:33:30] I've got a good quote for long-winded
[1:33:31] preachers.
[1:33:37] Should I read it and scare you to death?
[1:33:41] Brother Brandham said, "We got time for
[1:33:44] other things." Oh, I wish he'd hurry up
[1:33:46] and quit preaching. 20 minutes is long
[1:33:48] enough for any preacher to preach. Well,
[1:33:51] you're starving to death. You're so
[1:33:53] thin, you look like a shadow. You need a
[1:33:56] good four-hour sermon sometimes to
[1:33:57] fatten you up on gospel vitamins.
[1:33:59] Hallelujah.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. We're just
[1:34:02] getting started.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; I I won't do that ever. If I do, I want
[1:34:09] you to carry me out of this church and
[1:34:11] don't ever let me come back.
[1:34:14] Brother talks about this. I'm going to
[1:34:16] close right after this quote. Like the
[1:34:17] spies on the road to the promised land,
[1:34:19] they was in an exodus coming out of
[1:34:21] Egypt. Come out by a promised word of
[1:34:23] God. God made his word known by a
[1:34:25] prophet. Moses sent him down there. He
[1:34:28] was identified that he was the God to
[1:34:30] bring him out under the conditions that
[1:34:31] he promised to the I am. When they come
[1:34:35] to the borderland, Kadis Barnea, the
[1:34:37] great mistake they made when they got to
[1:34:39] the land and looked over to the promised
[1:34:40] land, they said, "We can't take it."
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; What was the other 10? They looked at
[1:34:45] the circumstances, the prestige that
[1:34:47] they would lose. We are grasshoppers to
[1:34:48] the side of them. But Joshua and Caleb
[1:34:51] checked up. They went back to the word
[1:34:54] sir.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; Now, this is where revival comes from,
[1:34:55] by the way. Back to the word.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; They went back to the word. And the Lord
[1:34:59] said, "I give you this land. It's a good
[1:35:01] land flowing with milk and honey."
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; They didn't count what it looked like,
[1:35:05] what this was, and what this evidence
[1:35:08] was. God's word said, "I give it to you.
[1:35:10] Go get it." And they were the only ones
[1:35:12] that went in. Oh, let us check the
[1:35:14] promises of God for today. That's right.
[1:35:16] Remember, we're in another exodus, a
[1:35:18] time, an exodus this time, not into a
[1:35:20] promised land OF THE EARTH, BUT INTO THE
[1:35:22] PROMISED LAND OF GLORY where there is no
[1:35:24] return no more. GLORY TO GOD. HE SAID,
[1:35:26] "WE'RE GOING TO BE THERE." What did he
[1:35:27] promise before that time come? THAT THE
[1:35:29] CHURCH WOULD BE SO MUCH LIKE HIM. It
[1:35:31] would even be the same that the works
[1:35:33] that I do will you do also. We'll see
[1:35:35] again the vindicated PROMISE AGAIN AND
[1:35:38] AGAIN. I SAY BY faith tonight, WE'VE
[1:35:40] SEEN THESE THINGS. WE'RE STANDING ON THE
[1:35:43] PROMISES OF GOD AND WE ARE GOING TO A
[1:35:45] PROMISED LAND.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT GOING TO STAY IN LEOSA. IT'S
[1:35:48] TIME WE GET OUT OF HERE. IT'S TIME WE
[1:35:50] QUIT LOOKING AROUND AND WORRYING ABOUT
[1:35:52] THE POLITICS OF THIS WORLD. We're on our
[1:35:54] way to Canaan's land. And it DON'T
[1:35:56] MATTER IF SOMEBODY TRIES TO HINDER ME.
[1:35:58] I'M GOING ON WITH JESUS JUST THE SAME.
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; I'M NOT STOPPING. I'M NOT TURNING
[1:36:04] AROUND. IT'S NOT BETTER IN EGYPT. IT'S
[1:36:06] BETTER WHERE WE'RE GOING.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT BETTER HERE IF YOU GAVE ME $10
[1:36:10] MILLION. MAYBE I'D HAVE A GOOD LIFE. BUT
[1:36:12] I'M GOING TO TELL YOU SOMETHING. Worry
[1:36:14] would still be there.
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; COME ON.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; FEAR WOULD STILL BE THERE.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; ANXIETY WOULD STILL BE THERE. BUT WHERE
[1:36:20] I'M GOING, THERE IS NO MORE FEAR. THERE
[1:36:22] IS NO MORE ANXIETY. THERE IS NO MORE
[1:36:24] CANCER. THERE IS NO MORE DEATH. COME ON,
[1:36:26] SOMEBODY. THERE IS NO MORE COLD DEAD
[1:36:28] RELIGION. IT'S ALL PEACE AND JOY AND
[1:36:31] HAPPINESS. THAT'S WHERE WE'RE GOING.
[1:36:33] THIS IS JUST NOTHING BUT A SHADOW.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, LORD.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; BUT THE THINGS THAT ARE COMING ARE
[1:36:37] PERFECTION THAT'S COMING.
[1:36:40] HE'S JUST WAITING FOR YOU TO GET READY
[1:36:41] AND SAY, "LOOK, WE'RE GOING TO DO THE
[1:36:43] SAME THINGS."
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; I SAY IT'S TIME THE MINISTRY CAN STAND
[1:36:46] BOLDLY ON THE PLATFORM TODAY AND CAST
[1:36:48] OUT DEMONS.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; Come on. Yes, sir.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; You say, "Are we scared to do that?" No,
[1:36:52] sir. We have the word of God backing us
[1:36:54] up.
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; We do.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; Do you realize when we lay hands ON
[1:37:00] PEOPLE, WE'RE NOT DOING THAT FOR SHOW.
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; Come on. Do you realize WE HAVE PEOPLE
[1:37:04] COME TO THIS ALTAR AND WE LAY HANDS ON
[1:37:05] THEM, BROTHER STEWART, Brother Ben and
[1:37:06] I, we're not doing that for show,
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; WE'RE DOING THAT BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IN
[1:37:10] THE POWER OF THE WORD THAT IF THEY LAY
[1:37:13] HANDS ON THE SICK, THEY SHALL RECOVER.
[1:37:16] THAT'S WHY WHEN THE WHEN THE YOUNG
[1:37:17] PEOPLE ARE HERE AND YOU ELDERS COME AND
[1:37:19] PRAY WITH THEM, YOUR HANDS HAVE THE SAME
[1:37:21] POWER.
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; Come on,
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; by the authority in them. Come on,
[1:37:24] church. I'M I'M PREACHING TO YOU NOW.
[1:37:26] I'M OFF MY NOTES, BUT I WANT TO TELL YOU
[1:37:27] THIS. IT'S TIME WE REALIZE WHO WE ARE.
[1:37:30] IT'S TIME WE REALIZE WE CAN LAY HANDS ON
[1:37:32] A SICK BODY. IT'S TIME WE REALIZE THAT
[1:37:34] WE CAN TAKE THE FAITH THAT WE'VE BEEN
[1:37:36] GIVEN AND WE CAN CAST OUT DEMONS.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; You say, "What kind of demons can we
[1:37:40] cast out?" All of them.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; All of them. Brother Stewart, I don't
[1:37:45] care if it's anxiety. You know, this is
[1:37:47] an age of anxiety.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; It's time we just go ahead and say,
[1:37:50] "Lord, I'm going to call I'm I'm going
[1:37:52] to call for the elders of the church.
[1:37:54] They're going to lay their hands on me
[1:37:55] because I'm sick with anxiety, and it's
[1:37:57] going to be gone. And I'm not claiming
[1:37:59] anxiety no more.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; Are you in depression? YOU GOT
[1:38:02] DEPRESSION SPIRIT ON YOU.
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; I'm not asking you to raise your hand. I
[1:38:05] don't want you to even THINK ABOUT IT. I
[1:38:07] WANT YOU TO THINK LIKE THIS. If you're
[1:38:08] battling the spirit of depression, IT'S
[1:38:10] TIME TO CALL FOR the elders of the
[1:38:11] church to lay hands ON YOU AND CAST OUT
[1:38:13] THE DEVIL of depression. YOU SAY, "WELL,
[1:38:14] IT DIDN'T LEAVE ME THE NEXT DAY." HOLD
[1:38:16] ON TO THE PROMISE OF GOD. IT'S GONE IN
[1:38:18] THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; I TELL YOU, we prayed with PEOPLE WITH
[1:38:22] CANCER. I'VE TOLD SISTER Alice about it.
[1:38:24] I'VE TOLD HER, "WE'RE NOT GIVING UP."
[1:38:25] That that the devil of cancer is
[1:38:27] defeated. You know, JUST BECAUSE
[1:38:29] SOMEBODY GETS OVER, YOU SAY, "WELL,
[1:38:30] you're over 80 or you're you're you're
[1:38:32] in your up older years." Listen, the
[1:38:33] devil does not have to take you out.
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; The devil DOES NOT HAVE ANY LEGAL RIGHTS
[1:38:38] ON YOUR BODY. THE DEVIL DOES NOT HAVE
[1:38:40] ANY LEGAL RIGHTS ON YOUR FAMILY. IT'S
[1:38:42] TIME WE START CLAIMING THEM AGAIN AND
[1:38:44] BELIEVING THAT THE PROMISES WILL COME TO
[1:38:46] PASS.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; I understand that death is just a change
[1:38:50] and we shouldn't fear it. Come on.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; But we don't have to die sick.
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; Do you realize the perfect will of God
[1:38:55] is for your healing?
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; And you say, "Well, is it my faith? Is
[1:39:00] it my faith?" Just believe.
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; And whatever happens,
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; I'm going to hold on to faith.
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; I'm going to believe anyway.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; I don't care what the doctor's report at
[1:39:11] the finals do at the final doctor's
[1:39:13] exam. When he says, "I can't do nothing
[1:39:15] more for you." You can walk out of there
[1:39:17] and say, "Thank God for healing me."
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. Come on now.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; When he says, "I can't do nothing." I
[1:39:22] think of brother Robert tonight.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; They want to do a heart transplant.
[1:39:26] Well, if the doctors can't find you a
[1:39:27] heart, I know somebody that created the
[1:39:29] heart.
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord,
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; Sister Alice. When the doctor says you
[1:39:33] need certain medication or you or maybe
[1:39:35] it won't work or we don't even know. We
[1:39:36] we we don't know IF THERE'S A WAY TO
[1:39:38] CURE YOU OR NOT. I KNOW SOMEBODY WHO CAN
[1:39:39] HEAL ALL YOUR DISEASES. COME ON,
[1:39:42] SOMEBODY. YOU YOUNG PEOPLE THAT ARE
[1:39:44] FIGHTING DEVILS OF PORNOGRAPHY, I KNOW
[1:39:46] SOMEBODY WHO CAN DELIVER YOU FROM THAT
[1:39:48] DEMON HERE TONIGHT. FOR YOU PEOPLE THAT
[1:39:50] ARE FIGHTING, I TELL YOU WHAT, YOU SAY,
[1:39:51] "MY MARRIAGE IS ON THE ROCKS. I DON'T
[1:39:52] KNOW IF I CAN MAKE IT. I KNOW SOMEBODY
[1:39:54] WHO'S GOT A HE'S GOT A DOSE OF LOVE
[1:39:57] READY FOR YOU TONIGHT."
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; DO YOU REALIZE WHAT WE NEED IN THE HOUSE
[1:40:00] OF GOD IS TO LET GOD HAVE HIS WAY?
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; We we we think we've got to we got to
[1:40:05] figure it out. This is how God's going
[1:40:06] to do it this service and that service.
[1:40:08] And I tell you what, it's time we just
[1:40:10] let God BE GOD. IT'S TIME WE JUST GO
[1:40:11] AHEAD AND SAY, "I don't care about the
[1:40:13] armies that's chasing me. I don't I know
[1:40:15] that he's a rock in a weary land. I know
[1:40:18] he's a shelter in THE TIME OF STORM. I
[1:40:20] KNOW HE IS THE HIGH PRIEST OF MY
[1:40:22] PROFESSION. I KNOW HE'S GOD.
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; I'M NOT GIVING UP. I'M NOT TURNING
[1:40:27] AROUND. I'M GOING TO KEEP MOVING FORWARD
[1:40:29] BY THE GRACE OF GOD. BROTHER BRANDON
[1:40:31] SAID WE'RE in an Exodus. Are you in an
[1:40:33] Exodus today? You realize we've been
[1:40:36] called by the same vindication that the
[1:40:39] children of Israel was.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; I'm going to I'm going to leave you with
[1:40:41] this. And I know I lied to you already.
[1:40:45] If you're watching at home, I apologize.
[1:40:46] You can turn this off anytime you want
[1:40:47] to.
[1:40:53] You realize that the mana was a revival.
[1:40:56] It caused a revival for a while.
[1:40:59] The rock in a weary land, the water that
[1:41:02] came from the rock, you realize that
[1:41:04] created revival for a while, but then
[1:41:10] the next thing you know, it gets
[1:41:12] stagnant and it gets stale. Not because
[1:41:15] the water changed, not because the mana
[1:41:17] changed.
[1:41:19] It's because the people started looking
[1:41:21] around and wanting something different.
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; And I wonder today if we'd quit looking
[1:41:28] around and say, "Lord, I want it my way
[1:41:31] or I'm just going to I'm not going to be
[1:41:32] happy. I want it my way or I just can't
[1:41:35] shout in church. I want my songs or I
[1:41:38] can't worship. I want I want my singers
[1:41:41] to sing or I I don't I'm just going to
[1:41:43] leave mad. I want the preacher to preach
[1:41:45] on this and God told him to preach
[1:41:47] something else.
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; And the next thing you know,
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; we're at war one with one another and
[1:41:52] Satan has got you right where he wants
[1:41:54] you.
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; Sitting in the house of God fussing.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; He don't care if you're here
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; if you're fussing. Brother Joel, is
[1:42:01] there problems like that in this church?
[1:42:03] This is one of the finest groups of
[1:42:04] people I've ever been around and had the
[1:42:06] privilege of preaching to. You really
[1:42:07] are. I don't say that because I go to
[1:42:09] church here. I say that because you
[1:42:10] really are. I I would hear I would hear
[1:42:13] if there was a lot of fussing and
[1:42:14] feuding going on. We don't have that in
[1:42:15] this church. And I thank God for that.
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; It's commendable to a church this size.
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; We don't We're not the biggest church,
[1:42:20] but we're a good group of people. And
[1:42:21] I'm going to go ahead and tell you
[1:42:22] something. A church this size that that
[1:42:24] can really just seem to get along as
[1:42:27] well as we do.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; But watch out.
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; Satan wants to come among you.
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; He wants to get on your shoulder
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; and tell you somebody didn't shake your
[1:42:36] hand. That's right.
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; And if he can get you distracted,
[1:42:40] Pharaoh's army will come in. And when
[1:42:42] you finally see it, you're scared to
[1:42:43] death. Keep your eyes on the promise.
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; If you would look to the promise, none
[1:42:49] of these things matter.
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; We're in a word revival today.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; And I believe the world is dying
[1:42:58] for what we have.
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; We ought to be thankful for what we
[1:43:02] have.
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; The world's dying, but the bride's
[1:43:04] getting ready to fly.
[1:43:06] The world's going down, but we're going
[1:43:07] up.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; That's why I don't believe in preaching
[1:43:10] doom and gloom to the people that your
[1:43:12] kids might not make it.
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; I don't believe in preaching that to you
[1:43:15] people.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; I don't believe in telling you that you
[1:43:17] might not make it. I believe you will.
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; Because I don't believe I'm preaching to
[1:43:22] the world. I believe I'm preaching to
[1:43:23] the bride.
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; And if all I've got to preach is you may
[1:43:25] not make it. You may not listen. I I
[1:43:27] believe in preaching exactly what a
[1:43:28] prophet said. And he tells us we get
[1:43:30] cold, we get indifferent, we have
[1:43:31] problems. The stickiest nature in the
[1:43:34] building is just a flower that needs
[1:43:35] water.
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; What the prophet said, he said, "It's a
[1:43:39] little cactus just needs water."
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; Brother Stewart, Brother Ben, we we all
[1:43:43] need water.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; From the ministers, from the front to
[1:43:45] the back, everything in between. We need
[1:43:48] water.
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; We need revival.
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; I don't care if I jump and shout, but I
[1:43:53] want to live the life.
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; I MAY NOT SCREAM AND HOLLER LIKE
[1:43:57] EVERYBODY, BUT AND that's okay. I want
[1:43:59] it however it comes.
[1:44:01] If the hol if the effects of the Holy
[1:44:02] Ghost come upon you and you scream and
[1:44:04] stagger and whatever you do, don't I
[1:44:06] ain't going to criticize you. I'm going
[1:44:07] to praise the Lord for that. And if the
[1:44:09] Lord does it for me, I want you to do
[1:44:10] the same thing. We don't criticize.
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; We're one.
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; We're not in a spirit of criticism. I
[1:44:17] thought this was my thought. I don't
[1:44:19] want to be crowned a crab old man or
[1:44:22] woman.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; I don't want that spirit on me.
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; I by nature I fight criticism. I fight a
[1:44:29] critical spirit by nature. I fight
[1:44:31] legalism
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; by nature.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; I fight things where it's hard sometimes
[1:44:36] to just get a clear just being honest
[1:44:38] with you.
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; It's by nature. But my nature on this
[1:44:43] flesh is not ever going to be converted.
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; But there's something on the inside of
[1:44:47] me that is crying out for more of him.
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; THERE'S SOMETHING ON THE INSIDE OF ME
[1:44:52] THAT I DON'T I JUST DON'T WANT TO MISS
[1:44:54] CHURCH.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; I don't feel I'm missing the rapture if
[1:44:57] I miss it. I don't feel I'm going to
[1:44:58] hell if I miss it. He did a lot for me.
[1:45:01] I'm going to do the least I can do.
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; He did a lot for me. He brought me from
[1:45:06] places I never Listen, church,
[1:45:08] musicians, come. My time's up. Can I go
[1:45:11] ahead and tell you something? We went
[1:45:13] Every one of you could have a testimony.
[1:45:15] I've been through a lot.
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; But he brought you from your Egypt to
[1:45:19] the promised land.
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; He delivered you to take you in.
[1:45:24] But if you're in the middle of your
[1:45:27] journey and you find yourself hungry, he
[1:45:31] can provide food for you.
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; If you find yourself thirsty, Brother
[1:45:35] Matthew, he can provide water for you.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; If you find yourself getting cold in the
[1:45:41] house of God, don't ever let the devil
[1:45:43] tell you, "Maybe I should just quit."
[1:45:45] It's the time for a refreshing.
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; When you feel like revival can't come,
[1:45:52] be the revival.
[1:45:53] WHEN YOU FEEL LIKE EVERYTHING'S AGAINST
[1:45:56] YOU IN THIS WORLD, and it may be
[1:45:59] because the world is never going to love
[1:46:02] the way we act. It's never going to it's
[1:46:04] never going to understand. Why would you
[1:46:07] go to church twice on Sunday? Why would
[1:46:08] you go to church on a Wednesday night?
[1:46:09] You don't need that. Why would you drive
[1:46:12] for church? There's one right down the
[1:46:14] street. But we know what we've got here.
[1:46:18] I I'm I'm telling you here today.
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; I have you forgotten.
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; We've been through some trials, but look
[1:46:24] where God's brought us now.
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; We've been through Come on, church. Do
[1:46:28] you realize that that if you would quit
[1:46:31] looking at the problems and start
[1:46:32] looking at where Listen, look at the
[1:46:33] blessings of God on this church.
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; I I could I could start naming them off.
[1:46:37] I can look at Sister Stephanie with her
[1:46:39] hand in the air and I can tell you God
[1:46:41] has done miraculous and marvelous things
[1:46:43] for Sister Stephanie. I can tell you.
[1:46:45] Amen. S you look at sister Alice AND SAY
[1:46:48] CANCER'S GOT HER BODY. I can TELL YOU
[1:46:50] GOD IS DOING marvelous and miraculous
[1:46:51] things for our sister Alice. Come on
[1:46:53] somebody. I can look here today and I
[1:46:56] can see BROTHER LEVI AS A YOUNG MAN. He
[1:46:58] can he can look BACK AND SAY I STRUGGLED
[1:46:59] BUT LOOK WHERE HE'S AT TODAY. GOD COME
[1:47:02] ON SOMEBODY. GOD WHO IS RICH IN MERCY
[1:47:04] HAS BROUGHT YOU TO THIS PLACE BUT HE
[1:47:07] WANTS YOU IN REVIVAL. BROTHER GABE,
[1:47:09] SATAN TRIED TO GET YOU BUT HE COULDN'T
[1:47:11] TAKE YOU OUT. SISTER JANIE, THE DEVIL'S
[1:47:14] TRIED TO GIVE YOU HARDSHIP IN YOUR LIFE,
[1:47:16] BUT GOD HAS STILL GOT YOU HERE, AND IT'S
[1:47:18] A PURPOSE IN IT. COME ON, SOMEBODY. I
[1:47:21] WISH SOMEBODY COULD RECOGNIZE THE
[1:47:22] GOODNESS OF GOD HERE FOR A MINUTE.
[1:47:23] SISTER HELEN, SATAN'S TRIED TO TAKE YOU
[1:47:25] OUT, BUT GOD'S GOT YOU.
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; PHARAOH'S ARMY'S TRIED TO COME.
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; But greater is what we're following
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; than what's trying to come AFTER US.
[1:47:37] BROTHER MATTHEW, SATAN'S TRIED TO TAKE
[1:47:39] YOU OUT MANY TIMES, BUT YOU FOUND
[1:47:40] YOURSELF SITTING IN THE HOUSE OF GOD
[1:47:42] WITH YOUR HAND RAISED WORSHIPING GOD.
[1:47:44] COME ON, SOMEBODY. IF YOU NEED A
[1:47:46] BREAKTHROUGH, IT'S TIME FOR A
[1:47:47] BREAKTHROUGH. IF YOU SAY, "I I NEED MORE
[1:47:49] OF GOD." STAND AND GIVE GOD PRAISE AND
[1:47:52] SAY, "LORD, I NEED MORE OF YOU."
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; WE'VE COMPASSED THIS MOUNTAIN LONG
[1:47:57] ENOUGH. IT'S TIME THAT WE RECOGNIZE WHO
[1:48:00] WE ARE. IT'S TIME WE RECOGNIZE, SISTER
[1:48:03] STEPHANIE, THAT GOD'S GOT YOUR
[1:48:04] SITUATION.
[1:48:07] IT'S TIME WE QUIT LOOKING AT ALL THE
[1:48:09] PROBLEMS in our church and in our
[1:48:10] families. I tell you what,
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; think about sister Anna. She went years
[1:48:17] WHERE SHE NEVER PLAYED THE PIANO BECAUSE
[1:48:19] SATAN HAD HER IN BONDAGE. But tonight,
[1:48:21] she's sitting IN THE HOUSE OF GOD
[1:48:22] WORSHIPING BY THE WAY OF MUSIC. WHAT IS
[1:48:24] IT? GOD WHO IS RICH IN MERCY.
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; Brother Stewart is a young man. Maybe
[1:48:30] you'd have looked at his life as a young
[1:48:31] man and SAID HE'LL NEVER BE A PREACHER.
[1:48:33] BUT HERE he is tonight STANDING AS A
[1:48:35] DEACON AND A MINISTER OF THE GOSPEL. I'M
[1:48:37] TALKING ABOUT WHAT GOD IS DOING. IT'S A
[1:48:39] POSITIVE THING THAT GOD HAS DONE.
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord.
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; I think of Sister Millie.
[1:48:46] She can't have a baby.
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; She's got she's got arthritis. SHE SHE'S
[1:48:52] NEVER GOING TO BE EVER ABLE TO HAVE
[1:48:54] CHILDREN. BUT THE WORD SAID DIFFERENT.
[1:48:57] WE'VE GOT REAL TESTIMONIES, RIGHT? COME
[1:48:58] ON, SOMEBODY. I'll tell you what, why
[1:49:00] can't WE JUST START DWELLING ON THE
[1:49:02] TESTIMONIES AND TELL THAT DEVIL HE HAS
[1:49:04] NO RIGHT among our church building. We
[1:49:07] we WE'VE SAT HERE LONG ENOUGH AND TRIED
[1:49:09] TO SAY THAT THE DEVIL'S GOING TO DO THIS
[1:49:11] AND the devil's GOING TO DO THAT. I TELL
[1:49:12] YOU WHAT, THE DEVIL'S GOING TO TRY TO DO
[1:49:14] A LOT OF THINGS, BUT HE WILL NOT SUCCEED
[1:49:17] BECAUSE I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, LIKE a
[1:49:18] prophet said it. A prophet said, if
[1:49:20] you're the skin on the bottom of the
[1:49:22] foot of the body of Christ, then every
[1:49:24] devil is under your feet.
[1:49:29] IF HE'S UNDER YOUR FEET, THEN WHY ARE
[1:49:31] YOU WORRYING?
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; ALL YOU GOT TO DO IS STEP ON HIM AND
[1:49:35] SAY, "SATAN, YOU can't have me."
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, I see I see a I see
[1:49:42] people out here with their hands up and
[1:49:43] they're crying. I'm going to tell you
[1:49:44] something. It's time you go ahead and
[1:49:46] just thank God for what he's done for
[1:49:47] you.
[1:49:49] &gt;&gt; It's time you go, "BROTHER JOEL, WHAT
[1:49:51] YOU DOING?" I TELL YOU WHAT WHAT I LIKE
[1:49:52] TO SEE IN THE HOUSE OF GOD. I IT'S TIME
[1:49:55] WE QUIT WORRYING ABOUT WHAT THE WORLD
[1:49:57] THINKS ABOUT US. IT'S TIME WE QUIT
[1:49:59] THINKING, "WELL, FOOTBALL STARTS AT
[1:50:00] 7:00. I GOT TO GET HOME AND WATCH THE
[1:50:02] GAME." IS GOD NOT IMPORTANT ENOUGH FOR
[1:50:05] US?
[1:50:07] &gt;&gt; Is he worthy of our time?
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm tired, Brother Joel. We do a
[1:50:11] lot of things that make us tired.
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; Not very many of them bother us, but we
[1:50:17] sure like to put a limit on God, don't
[1:50:18] we?
[1:50:23] church, we need a refilling here today.
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; We need a renewing.
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; It's time. YOUNG PEOPLE, I TELL YOU
[1:50:29] WHAT, I'VE seen the tenderness in our
[1:50:31] young people's hearts. I've seen their
[1:50:33] their willingness to sing and their
[1:50:35] willingness to worship and their
[1:50:36] willingness WHEN THEY FEEL AN URGE TO
[1:50:38] PRAY, THEY'LL COME TO THE ALTAR. I THINK
[1:50:40] WE NEED TO QUIT CRITICIZING and join
[1:50:42] them once in a while. I TELL YOU WHAT,
[1:50:44] SOMETIMES OUR ELDERS, come on, church,
[1:50:47] our elders are the best elders in the
[1:50:48] message. best people I know. But every
[1:50:51] one of us, including you, I don't care
[1:50:53] if you've been in the message 50 years,
[1:50:55] you need a revival.
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; It'll make you talk different, act
[1:51:00] different, walk different. Brother Joel,
[1:51:02] we need a revival. Every one of us need
[1:51:04] a revival. I tell you right now, I think
[1:51:07] brothers and sist brothers and brothers,
[1:51:09] sisters, sisters, put your hands on
[1:51:10] somebody.
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Jesus.
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; Lay hands on one another right here in
[1:51:13] the building.
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Jesus.
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what. I'll tell you what
[1:51:17] we're going to do.
[1:51:19] Do you realize that what we're doing
[1:51:20] right now is according to the Bible,
[1:51:22] you're laying hands on one another?
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:26] &gt;&gt; Do you realize the power of laying
[1:51:28] hands? According to the word of God, if
[1:51:31] you lay hands on the sick, they shall
[1:51:33] recover.
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; You don't have to stand here. My hands
[1:51:37] don't have to be on you. BUT WHEN YOU
[1:51:40] LAY HANDS ON SOMEBODY, do you realize
[1:51:42] the power that God has given you? It's
[1:51:45] an authority. And according to the word
[1:51:47] of God, if you're sick right now, claim
[1:51:49] your healing. IF THERE'S A SPIRIT OF
[1:51:51] INDIFFERENCE ON YOU TONIGHT, CLAIM YOUR
[1:51:53] HEALING. I want you to do me THIS FAVOR.
[1:51:56] I WANT EVERY one of you to pray for the
[1:51:58] person next to you. You don't have
[1:51:59] whether you just go ahead and pray
[1:52:01] aloud. Pray what you want to do. I WANT
[1:52:03] THIS CHURCH TO JUST PRAY. LISTEN,
[1:52:04] CHURCH, YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE UP HERE TO
[1:52:07] GET HEALED. You don't have to be up
[1:52:09] here. I THINK OF MY BROTHER DANNY
[1:52:10] SITTING OVER HERE. Sister Vickiy's got
[1:52:12] hands on him. THAT'S ENOUGH POWER TO
[1:52:14] HEAL that leg trouble he's going
[1:52:15] through. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Thank
[1:52:17] you for coming, Lord.
[1:52:18] &gt;&gt; He's an elder sitting here in the church
[1:52:20] going through things. I'm looking
[1:52:21] around. I see problems in the church. I
[1:52:23] SEE WHAT THE DEVIL'S TRIED TO DO. BUT
[1:52:25] GREATER IS HE THAT IS IN THE HANDS THAT
[1:52:26] ARE LAID ON YOU IN THE BODY OF CHRIST
[1:52:28] THAT IS PRAYING FOR YOU. I want you to
[1:52:30] pray right now. I want to pray for these
[1:52:32] on the platform. You pray right where
[1:52:34] you are.
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; Pray for one another. Just just open
[1:52:37] your open your let the voice go and say,
[1:52:39] "Lord, I'm praying. I I want A REVIVAL.
[1:52:42] I NEED A REVIVAL. THE PERSON NEXT TO ME,
[1:52:44] THEY THEY NEED A REVIVAL. I want you to
[1:52:47] just close your eyes and pray right now
[1:52:48] for that person next to you.
[1:52:52] Oh God,
[1:52:54] God
[1:52:59] every
[1:53:09] Lord Brother
[1:53:12] disease every
[1:53:33] spirit of anxiety.
[1:53:36] I pray Lord
[1:53:38] for this public.
[1:53:49] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[1:53:51] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord Jesus.
[1:53:53] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord Jesus. Wonder if you
[1:53:55] could just raise your hands and give God
[1:53:56] praise in the building. Give God praise
[1:53:59] in the building. If you NEED A
[1:54:00] BREAKTHROUGH TONIGHT, JUST TAKE YOUR
[1:54:02] BREAKTHROUGH. I'M NOT GIVING UP. DIDN'T
[1:54:05] HE WALK ON THE WATER?
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; Some thought he was a ghost.
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; SOME THOUGHT IT WAS JUST ANOTHER SPIRIT,
[1:54:11] BUT IT WAS CHRIST WALKING ON THAT WATER.
[1:54:14] &gt;&gt; Tell you what, you may be on the You may
[1:54:16] be sinking in the middle of the ocean
[1:54:17] right here tonight.
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; But he's reaching out a hand for you.
[1:54:22] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. You say, "Is anything
[1:54:24] too hard for God?" Nothing's too HARD
[1:54:26] FOR GOD. WHATEVER YOUR PROBLEM IS HERE
[1:54:28] TONIGHT, HE CAN TAKE CARE OF IT BEFORE
[1:54:30] YOU WALK OUT them doors. Can you just
[1:54:32] RAISE YOUR HAND? SAY, "I ACCEPT MY
[1:54:33] HEALING. I ACCEPT WHAT GOD'S DONE FOR
[1:54:36] ME."
[1:54:37] &gt;&gt; You say, "BROTHER JOEL, YOU'RE TRYING TO
[1:54:39] WORK THE PEOPLE." NO, I'M TELLING YOU
[1:54:40] WHAT GOD'S ALREADY DONE FOR YOU. I AIN'T
[1:54:42] WORKING YOU UP. I'M TELLING YOU, YOU ARE
[1:54:43] THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST.
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; You are she. YOU ARE THE ONES THAT GOD
[1:54:49] HAS CALLED.
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; Anybody feel like worshiping now?
[1:54:54] Anybody feel? I'll tell you what. If the
[1:54:56] chains are broken, I want your hands in
[1:54:58] the air.
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; You know, think about it. A free person
[1:55:02] can raise their hands, not because they
[1:55:05] want to, BUT BECAUSE THEY'RE DEFYING
[1:55:06] GRAVITY THAT'S TRYING TO hold them down.
[1:55:08] You are raising YOUR HANDS TO DEFY
[1:55:10] GRAVITY RIGHT HERE TONIGHT BECAUSE GOD
[1:55:12] HAS PUT SOMETHING IN YOUR HEART to say,
[1:55:14] "Lord, I'm delivered. I'M FREE. I'M NOT
[1:55:17] EVEN GOING TO DWELL ON THE THINGS THAT
[1:55:18] HAVE HINDERED ME IN MY PAST. I'M GOING
[1:55:20] FORWARD." SOMEBODY GIVE GOD PRAISE IN
[1:55:23] THE BUILDING.
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; SOMEBODY SAY, "PRAISE THE LORD.
[1:55:31] Go ahead, just keep telling him how much
[1:55:32] you love him. I wonder if YOU CAN JUST
[1:55:34] POUR YOUR PRAISE OUT WITH YOUR LIPS
[1:55:36] RIGHT NOW. SAY HOW MUCH YOU LOVE HIM.
[1:55:39] SOME SAY HOW MUCH YOU THANK HIM FOR.
[1:55:40] SOMEBODY START TESTIFYING IN THE
[1:55:42] BUILDING OF WHAT GOD'S DONE FOR YOU.
[1:55:46] Thank you, Lord.
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; Brother Joel, we need some order in
[1:55:48] here. Excuse me. Let's get out of order
[1:55:50] just long enough to have some saving in
[1:55:51] the house of God. LET'S GET OUT OF ORDER
[1:55:53] LONG ENOUGH TO HAVE SOME HEALING IN THE
[1:55:55] HOUSE OF GOD. MUST GET OUT OF ORDER LONG
[1:55:57] ENOUGH TO SEE SOME YOUNG PEOPLE FILLED
[1:55:58] WITH THE HOLY GHOST. How many of you has
[1:56:00] been baptized?
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:56:03] &gt;&gt; Your promise is the Holy Ghost.
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; Your promise is the Holy Ghost. Don't
[1:56:07] let the DEVIL STOP YOU SHORT OF YOUR
[1:56:09] PROMISE.
[1:56:10] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:56:10] &gt;&gt; How many of you have been baptized over
[1:56:12] here?
[1:56:13] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:56:14] &gt;&gt; Your promise is the Holy Ghost.
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; If that DEVIL COMES TELLING YOU, "I
[1:56:18] AIN'T GOT THE HOLY GHOST." COME ON,
[1:56:19] SOMEBODY.
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; You young people, the devil's COMING TO
[1:56:22] TELL YOU, "I DON'T THINK I GOT THE HOLY
[1:56:23] GHOST." TELL THAT DEVIL HE'S A LIAR.
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; You realize you CAN WALK OUT ON FAITH
[1:56:29] WITH THE WORD OF GOD AND SAY, "I'VE BEEN
[1:56:31] BAPTIZED. I'VE BEEN FILLED. I'VE GOT THE
[1:56:34] HOLY GHOST AND SATAN CANNOT HAVE ME. I
[1:56:37] AM GOD'S PROPERTY."
[1:56:39] &gt;&gt; Young people, can somebody just You
[1:56:42] young people,
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; I know sometimes you don't want to
[1:56:45] worship because you're sitting on the
[1:56:46] front and you're thinking, "Everybody's
[1:56:47] looking at me." I'll tell you something.
[1:56:49] Greater is he that is in you than every
[1:56:51] devil that's going to fight you.
[1:56:53] Every devil's coming against you.
[1:56:54] Greater is he that is in you.
[1:56:58] &gt;&gt; If you've been baptized, you will be
[1:57:01] filled with the Holy Ghost.
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; Fear will try to come and say, "When
[1:57:05] when's it going to happen? Can it is it
[1:57:07] really going to happen?" And you find
[1:57:08] yourself in the middle of that journey.
[1:57:10] I don't think it's going to happen. It's
[1:57:11] been too long. It's yours.
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord.
[1:57:15] &gt;&gt; Young ladies, I'm telling you, God's got
[1:57:17] you.
[1:57:19] &gt;&gt; You quit letting the devil tell you
[1:57:20] you're not going to make it. You're
[1:57:21] going to make it.
[1:57:22] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:57:22] &gt;&gt; God will have a bride.
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; And if if if if one generation gets too
[1:57:27] old and they go to be with the Lord,
[1:57:28] then you are that generation that may go
[1:57:30] in.
[1:57:31] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; There will be a generation go all the
[1:57:33] way. There will be a generation that
[1:57:35] will not taste death. I I know I'm
[1:57:37] lingering tonight, but I see the faces
[1:57:39] OF THE PEOPLE. AND SOME of you just NEED
[1:57:41] TO HAVE A BREAKTHROUGH TONIGHT. YOU LAID
[1:57:42] HANDS on each other and you believe that
[1:57:44] the power of God is real. IF HE'S REAL,
[1:57:47] ACCEPT WHAT HE'S DONE FOR YOU HERE
[1:57:48] TONIGHT.
[1:57:50] LISTEN, you young people, I'm going to
[1:57:52] tell you what the devil's going to tell
[1:57:53] you. He told me, too.
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; He'll tell you,
[1:57:57] &gt;&gt; you'll never be good enough to be the
[1:57:59] bride.
[1:58:00] &gt;&gt; You're never going to make it.
[1:58:02] Maybe I Maybe my parents were message
[1:58:04] people, but do maybe I'm not supposed to
[1:58:06] be
[1:58:08] &gt;&gt; God didn't place you here by chance.
[1:58:10] &gt;&gt; He placed you here because he needed a
[1:58:12] bride.
[1:58:14] &gt;&gt; Brother Stewart, he didn't place you
[1:58:16] into a message BELIEVING HOME BY CHANCE.
[1:58:19] HE NEEDED MINISTERS TO TAKE THIS MESSAGE
[1:58:20] and preach it until the coming of the
[1:58:22] Lord.
[1:58:23] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Thank you,
[1:58:25] &gt;&gt; brother Gab. It wasn't by chance. You
[1:58:26] were BORN IN BROTHER DAVID'S HOME.
[1:58:28] &gt;&gt; It was predestination, NOT CHANCE.
[1:58:31] &gt;&gt; We don't believe in luck. We believe it.
[1:58:33] Come on, somebody.
[1:58:34] &gt;&gt; We don't believe this was lucky, Sister
[1:58:36] Stephanie, THAT YOU CAME BACK. THE
[1:58:37] DEVIL'S GOING TO FIGHT YOU, BUT YOU'VE
[1:58:39] ALREADY WON.
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; Sister Helen, THE DEVIL'S FOUGHT YOU
[1:58:42] LONG ENOUGH. YOU'RE A WINNER,
[1:58:45] &gt;&gt; Brother Herald. Satan puts you through
[1:58:47] hell and back in the last few years.
[1:58:51] &gt;&gt; The man's lost children, lost a wife.
[1:58:54] I'm going to go ahead and tell you
[1:58:54] something. The man's a testimony that
[1:58:56] he's still serving God.
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; HE STILL BELIEVES GOD. HE'S GOT A SON
[1:59:01] PREACHING THE GOSPEL, PASTOR OF THE
[1:59:03] CHURCH. HE STILL BELIEVES GOD
[1:59:06] BECAUSE HE KNOWS THAT HE'S GOING TO SEE
[1:59:07] HIM AGAIN.
[1:59:13] Brother Bill, you got family all around
[1:59:14] you sitting in church right now. Sister
[1:59:16] Sharon, you got family all around you
[1:59:17] sitting in church.
[1:59:19] &gt;&gt; It was worth holding on all these years
[1:59:21] to what God had FOR YOU. IT'S PAYING OFF
[1:59:24] IN THE CHILDREN AND THE GRANDCHILDREN
[1:59:25] AND THE GREAT GRANDCHILDREN. I TELL YOU
[1:59:27] WHAT, IT'S WORTH IT TO SEE THE ELDERS
[1:59:30] STILL COMING TO THE HOUSE OF GOD BECAUSE
[1:59:31] OUR YOUNG PEOPLE NEED IT.
[1:59:33] &gt;&gt; Sister Jackie, YOU'VE GOT CHILDREN AND
[1:59:35] GRANDCHILDREN SERVING THE LORD. And the
[1:59:37] ones that ain't SERVING THE LORD,
[1:59:38] THEY'RE COMING BACK. BROTHER HARVEY, YOU
[1:59:41] AIN'T GOT TO HAVE no
[1:59:46] devil tried to take this little man out.
[1:59:49] He tried to tell this boy right here
[1:59:50] that he can't be used of God. He's tried
[1:59:52] to give him a spirit of all kinds of
[1:59:54] Tell you what, he's tried to give him so
[1:59:56] much nervousness he can't think
[1:59:57] straight. But that devil's defeated
[2:00:00] right here, Petty.
[2:00:05] &gt;&gt; Said, "Brother Joel, I don't know what
[2:00:06] you're doing. I'm telling you what I'm
[2:00:07] doing. I'm slaying devils right now.
[2:00:09] Sister Noly, the devil tried TO TAKE YOU
[2:00:11] OUT, BUT YOU'RE HERE.
[2:00:16] I tell you what, Sister Gloria, just a
[2:00:19] few years ago, you wasn't sitting here.
[2:00:21] I tell you what I remember. I remember
[2:00:23] her husband, Brother Wes, calling me. He
[2:00:26] called me up just out of the blue. He
[2:00:27] found my found my number on a church
[2:00:28] flyer. He called me up and he said,
[2:00:30] "Would it be okay if we come and
[2:00:31] fellowship with y'all and and come to a
[2:00:33] meeting?" And they came to the meeting.
[2:00:35] And then they started coming and
[2:00:36] fellowshipping and God saw fit to bring
[2:00:38] her here to THE CHURCH. BUT THAT'S NOT
[2:00:40] ALL. It's not about just adding members.
[2:00:42] But then Ryan goes over there to youth
[2:00:43] camp and receives the Holy Ghost.
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; Now you say, "Well, he received the Holy
[2:00:51] Ghost. Is the devil going to fight him?"
[2:00:53] He's going to fight him harder now
[2:00:54] &gt;&gt; because he's got the HOLY GHOST. BUT I'M
[2:00:57] NOT GOING TO STAND HERE.
[2:00:59] &gt;&gt; I am NOT GOING TO STAND HERE AND LET THE
[2:01:00] DEVIL WIN my brother Ryan. I'm going to
[2:01:02] stand HERE AND SAY I'M NOT GOING TO LOOK
[2:01:04] AT THE MISTAKES. FOR THE RYAN MAKES. BUT
[2:01:06] I'M HOLDING ON TO WHAT I SAW AT YOUTH
[2:01:08] CAMP WAS A YOUNG MAN SURRENDER his heart
[2:01:10] to the Lord.
[2:01:11] &gt;&gt; I was there.
[2:01:13] &gt;&gt; I was there when it happened.
[2:01:15] &gt;&gt; I saw it.
[2:01:16] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[2:01:17] &gt;&gt; I saw it.
[2:01:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord.
[2:01:20] &gt;&gt; I don't see my brother Landon here
[2:01:22] tonight.
[2:01:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:23] &gt;&gt; He's in the back room.
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; I watched that young man at youth camp a
[2:01:27] couple years ago. I watched him come
[2:01:29] through that line. I'm sorry. If you got
[2:01:31] to go, you're free to go. I'm going to
[2:01:32] tell the devil why he's losing right
[2:01:34] now.
[2:01:36] Yes,
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; sir.
[2:01:37] &gt;&gt; I watched Brother L. You I tell you
[2:01:38] what, some of y'all want to know why
[2:01:39] it's important they go to youth camp.
[2:01:42] &gt;&gt; You can have it here or anywhere, but he
[2:01:43] got an atmosphere that was so powerful.
[2:01:46] &gt;&gt; He come through that prayer line. And
[2:01:48] I'll tell you what, that wasn't no shy
[2:01:50] young man did.
[2:01:51] &gt;&gt; I tell you, I saw the Holy Ghost come on
[2:01:53] him and he was weeping and crying and
[2:01:55] pouring his heart out. I'M NOT TRYING TO
[2:01:56] EMBARRASS MY BROTHER, BUT HE KNOWS THERE
[2:01:58] WAS A CHANGE IN THAT DAY. I've seen it
[2:02:00] all over him. I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND
[2:02:02] TELL YOU SOMETHING. SATAN LOST SOMEBODY
[2:02:03] THAT DAY.
[2:02:08] I'm looking right here in the front row
[2:02:10] right now. I wish you could see the
[2:02:11] faces of the YOUNG SISTERS OVER HERE.
[2:02:13] GOD'S DOING SOMETHING FOR THEM RIGHT
[2:02:14] NOW. WHY? Because the devil IS LOSING
[2:02:17] BECAUSE WE'RE TESTIFYING THAT GOD HAS
[2:02:19] ALREADY WON.
[2:02:22] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:02:24] &gt;&gt; You can have your religion, but right
[2:02:25] now we're we're killing devils. And
[2:02:27] these young ladies are standing here and
[2:02:28] the Lord is moving all over them. Thank
[2:02:30] you, Jesus.
[2:02:31] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[2:02:35] Thank you, Lord.
[2:02:35] &gt;&gt; You can tell me to quit all you want to,
[2:02:36] but there's young ladies here. They're
[2:02:37] balling their eyes out, ready to
[2:02:38] experience God.
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; I think we need to take time for our
[2:02:42] young people, church.
[2:02:44] &gt;&gt; It's time we quit just playing church.
[2:02:46] Why play church? Why check a box? Why
[2:02:49] not have church?
[2:02:51] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:02:52] &gt;&gt; The word went forth and TOLD YOU THAT
[2:02:54] JUST AS PHARAOH'S ARMY WAS DROWNED in
[2:02:56] the sea, EVERY ONE OF YOUR ENEMIES ARE
[2:02:58] DEAD. SISTER MILLIE, I SEE THE HOLY
[2:03:00] GHOST WORKING ALL OVER YOU RIGHT NOW.
[2:03:02] Just go ahead and raise your hands and
[2:03:04] accept THAT GOD HAS GIVEN you the Holy
[2:03:06] Ghost.
[2:03:07] &gt;&gt; Raise your hands right there, young
[2:03:08] lady. The Holy Gh Come on, somebody.
[2:03:14] Brother Joel, YOU'RE MAKING US
[2:03:15] EMOTIONAL. I TELL YOU WHAT, WE NEED A
[2:03:17] LITTLE BIT OF MOTION SOMETIMES TO
[2:03:19] REMEMBER WHO OUR GOD IS.
[2:03:22] &gt;&gt; We need to know.
[2:03:23] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[2:03:25] &gt;&gt; Thank you,
[2:03:26] &gt;&gt; Sister Bella. He's brought you a long
[2:03:28] way. He sent you here in the house of
[2:03:31] God and the word is working every day on
[2:03:33] her.
[2:03:36] &gt;&gt; I'm stood here and preached to her and
[2:03:38] I'm telling you right now, you can tell
[2:03:39] when the word starts getting effect on
[2:03:41] people.
[2:03:43] &gt;&gt; I look at brother Riley standing there.
[2:03:46] He ain't the loudest person in the
[2:03:47] building,
[2:03:48] but I see his faithfulness to the house
[2:03:50] of God. And buddy, that's going to pay
[2:03:52] off for your family.
[2:03:54] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[2:03:56] &gt;&gt; Go ahead.
[2:04:02] Faithfulness is important.
[2:04:05] I see Sister Sanders standing here.
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; Satan has fought her and her children
[2:04:11] for most people would have already given
[2:04:13] up.
[2:04:14] Couple years ago, we was driving driving
[2:04:17] to a tent meeting down here and she's
[2:04:18] sitting there telling us testimonies
[2:04:19] about really telling us what she'd been
[2:04:22] through. And the fact that she was still
[2:04:24] going to a meeting and ready to hear the
[2:04:26] word of God tells me that Satan still
[2:04:29] didn't win.
[2:04:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:31] &gt;&gt; THOSE CHILDREN MAY NOT BE HERE
[2:04:32] PHYSICALLY, BUT YOU HAVEN'T LOST one of
[2:04:35] them.
[2:04:37] &gt;&gt; Sister Emma, I remember when you
[2:04:39] couldn't sing at church because the
[2:04:40] devil had you bound. But now I've heard
[2:04:42] you sing PRAISES TO GOD. WHAT IS IT?
[2:04:44] IT'S GOD DOING SOMETHING FOR THE YOUNG
[2:04:46] PEOPLE. GOD DOING SOMETHING FOR THE OLD
[2:04:48] PEOPLE. GOD HAS NO limit to what his
[2:04:50] power can do.
[2:04:53] I look at brother JT. He may not feel
[2:04:55] like much sitting back there on the back
[2:04:56] row, BUT GOD'S GOT YOU HERE FOR A
[2:04:58] PURPOSE. It's important that he's still
[2:05:00] able to come to the house of God. Can we
[2:05:02] just go ahead and take one more minute
[2:05:03] and say this?
[2:05:05] &gt;&gt; If you need the Holy Ghost, you ain't
[2:05:07] got to feel it.
[2:05:09] &gt;&gt; Accept it.
[2:05:12] &gt;&gt; Brother Joel, You didn't call me out
[2:05:14] tonight.
[2:05:15] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what, Lord,
[2:05:17] &gt;&gt; Brother Stewart, Sister Allison, 12
[2:05:18] years today, that's a testament that God
[2:05:20] still has young people that can get
[2:05:22] married, have a family, go to church,
[2:05:24] put God first, and they can Come on,
[2:05:26] somebody.
[2:05:27] &gt;&gt; They can still BE OVERCOMERS IN AN AGE
[2:05:29] WE live in.
[2:05:31] We ain't got to We ain't got to raise a
[2:05:33] bunch of worldly people that are just a
[2:05:35] bunch OF PERVERTS AND PEOPLE THAT ARE
[2:05:37] TRYING TO GO AFTER THE THINGS OF THE
[2:05:39] WORLD. WE'VE GOT PEOPLE HERE WHO LOVE
[2:05:40] GOD. YES, YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE MISTAKES.
[2:05:42] YES, YOU'RE GOING TO DO SOMETHING THAT
[2:05:44] YOU MAY NOT BE PROUD OF, BUT GOD IS
[2:05:46] LEADING YOU.
[2:05:47] &gt;&gt; DON'T GIVE UP.
[2:05:50] &gt;&gt; I wonder if we could sing that song.
[2:05:53] &gt;&gt; You're worth worthy of it all. Do you
[2:05:55] believe he's worthy here tonight? I'm
[2:05:57] sorry I held you long.
[2:06:00] &gt;&gt; But what I felt right here at the end
[2:06:02] was to keep going because I saw the I
[2:06:06] &gt;&gt; I wish he could just I wish every
[2:06:07] minister could stand right here and look
[2:06:09] at what I'm looking at right now.
[2:06:12] It's hard to quit when the young people
[2:06:14] are standing there receiving
[2:06:16] &gt;&gt; more of the Holy Ghost.
[2:06:19] &gt;&gt; Brother Bobby, your family's in church
[2:06:21] because you've surrendered your life to
[2:06:23] Christ.
[2:06:24] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:06:27] &gt;&gt; Brother Bobby.
[2:06:27] &gt;&gt; Brother Bobby. See, he's let his life do
[2:06:29] his testifying for him.
[2:06:33] &gt;&gt; But your family's coming back.
[2:06:35] I'm
[2:06:35] &gt;&gt; not talking about your your children.
[2:06:37] They're already here. But your family's
[2:06:38] coming back. Sister Robin's sitting
[2:06:40] there and I tell you what, you know, I
[2:06:43] think about brother Kevin just come to
[2:06:44] my mind. We ain't losing brother Kevin.
[2:06:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:06:49] &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, where's he at tonight?"
[2:06:51] God's got him.
[2:06:54] &gt;&gt; God's got brother Kevin.
[2:06:56] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of people may not be here
[2:06:57] tonight, BUT I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE UP ON
[2:06:59] THEM. WHY? BECAUSE GOD'S NOT GIVING UP.
[2:07:03] God's got a God's got a people. Church,
[2:07:06] we've complained long enough. We've
[2:07:08] looked at problems long enough.
[2:07:11] &gt;&gt; If we would come to the house of God and
[2:07:13] look at every testimony, let me tell you
[2:07:15] the greatest testimony in the building.
[2:07:16] I haven't mentioned it yet. How many in
[2:07:18] here saved?
[2:07:20] Look at the testimonies in the building.
[2:07:22] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah.
[2:07:24] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:07:25] &gt;&gt; That is the greatest testimony, Brother
[2:07:27] Stewart, in the whole building. There
[2:07:28] are people sitting here tonight who are
[2:07:31] saved and FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST.
[2:07:33] WHY? NOT BECAUSE A MAN STOOD HERE AND
[2:07:35] PREACHED, BUT BECAUSE THE WORD CAME IN
[2:07:37] YOUR HEART. I THINK WHAT WE HAD TONIGHT
[2:07:39] WAS A LITTLE REVIVAL. DON'T LET THE
[2:07:41] REVIVAL DIE TOMORROW. LET'S KEEP ON THIS
[2:07:43] REVIVAL.
[2:07:46] &gt;&gt; What you heard this morning about
[2:07:48] revival.
[2:07:49] &gt;&gt; Don't wait for the stirring of the
[2:07:51] water.
[2:07:53] Don't wait for Don't wait for a man to
[2:07:55] come by and bring revival.
[2:07:57] &gt;&gt; Be the revival.
[2:07:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord.
[2:07:59] &gt;&gt; Right here tonight, I feel revival in
[2:08:01] the building. I really do. I I it ain't
[2:08:03] about feelings, but I feel it here. And
[2:08:04] I just as WELL I'D RATHER FEEL IT THAN
[2:08:06] NOT FEEL IT.
[2:08:06] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[2:08:08] &gt;&gt; Sister Reagan, I've sat here and watched
[2:08:10] you worship all night long. You are not
[2:08:12] going to be lost, but you are a daughter
[2:08:14] of God.
[2:08:15] &gt;&gt; Sister Kennedy, I'm sitting here
[2:08:17] watching you right now. I tell Listen,
[2:08:19] these young ladies right here had a
[2:08:20] breakthrough tonight.
[2:08:21] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Hallelujah.
[2:08:24] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:08:24] &gt;&gt; Where Sister L at? My last one, I'll
[2:08:27] stop. She's got a gift of God. You think
[2:08:29] the devil's not going to try to go after
[2:08:31] a gift?
[2:08:33] But she's using the gift to serve God.
[2:08:35] Lord,
[2:08:35] &gt;&gt; I say don't stop giving that gift to
[2:08:37] God.
[2:08:38] &gt;&gt; Don't stop using your gift for God.
[2:08:41] &gt;&gt; Don't stop. Why? Cuz Satan's going to
[2:08:42] try to get you.
[2:08:44] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:08:45] &gt;&gt; But we're not giving it to the devil.
[2:08:47] WE'RE GOING TO GIVE THE GLORY TO JESUS.
[2:08:49] HE IS WORTHY OF ALL OF YOUR PRAISE. HE'S
[2:08:52] WORTHY OF YOUR TIME. HE'S WORTHY OF YOUR
[2:08:55] TALENT. HE'S WORTHY OF EVERYTHING HERE
[2:08:57] TONIGHT.
[2:08:58] &gt;&gt; Brother Joe said here, faithful. And
[2:09:00] I'll tell you right now, Sister Joanna
[2:09:02] and Brother Joe sitting here, I know I
[2:09:04] said I was going to talk about the last
[2:09:05] one and quit, but they're sitting right
[2:09:07] here and they didn't give up on Sister
[2:09:09] Stephanie,
[2:09:10] &gt;&gt; and she's here.
[2:09:12] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[2:09:13] &gt;&gt; Satan can scar you up and
[2:09:17] &gt;&gt; God's still going to get you.
[2:09:21] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:09:22] &gt;&gt; I see Sister Jessica right here tonight.
[2:09:24] &gt;&gt; And Satan can try to battle you, but I'm
[2:09:26] going to go ahead and tell you
[2:09:26] something. You got sons sitting in the
[2:09:28] house of God because you were able to
[2:09:30] bring him here tonight. Come on, CHURCH.
[2:09:31] GIVE GOD SOME PRAISE IN THE BUILDING.
[2:09:34] GOD IS WORTHY OF PRAISE HERE TONIGHT. We
[2:09:37] ain't got to work NONE OF THIS STUFF UP.
[2:09:38] IF YOU START THINKING OF the goodness OF
[2:09:40] GOD, YOU CAN'T HELP BUT GET EXCITED. YOU
[2:09:42] START THINKING ABOUT WHAT GOD'S DONE FOR
[2:09:44] YOU, YOU CAN'T HELP BUT PRAISE HIM. He's
[2:09:47] worthy of it all.
[2:09:50] And to you are all things.
[2:09:53] Oh, you deserve. I'll worship him now
[2:09:56] just before we go.
[2:09:58] Oh yes, yes, you are worthy of it all.
[2:10:04] If he's worthy, just lift your hands up
[2:10:05] to him tonight.
[2:10:07] Oh yes, you are worthy of it all.
[2:10:15] Oh, for from you are all things
[2:10:20] and to you are all things.
[2:10:24] You deserve the glory. Sing it one more
[2:10:28] time with all your hearts now. Oh, you
[2:10:31] are worthy of it all.
[2:10:35] Yes, you are, Lord. Oh, yes, you are
[2:10:39] worthy of it all.
[2:10:46] from all things
[2:10:50] to you are all thanks.
[2:10:54] You deserve
[2:10:56] glory,
[2:10:59] Jes.
[2:11:01] I'm not giving up.
[2:11:04] Oh, I'm not turning around.
[2:11:08] Oh, by the grace of God, I a shining
[2:11:14] crown. Someday will I keep holding on,
[2:11:19] holding on for you to start.
[2:11:24] No, I'm not giving up. No, I'll be going
[2:11:29] on
