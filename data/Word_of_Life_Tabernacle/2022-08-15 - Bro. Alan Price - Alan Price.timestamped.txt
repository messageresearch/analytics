[55:20] on our heart this evening but
[55:23] hey man
[55:24] i was maybe gonna sing a song but
[55:25] sincerely you know i'll be all right i'm
[55:27] just kidding
[55:30] hey man
[55:32] and they didn't want to hear me sing
[55:34] anymore after this morning so but
[55:36] appreciate the specials and everything
[55:37] this evening but
[55:39] uh this uh this afternoon i just like to
[55:41] just preach a very simple thought i
[55:43] don't know really who it's for but i
[55:44] just couldn't get away from it but we'll
[55:46] turn to john chapter nine and
[55:48] um this is something that's always
[55:50] always stuck with me it's um something i
[55:53] studied really really early on and
[55:56] um and maybe for the young people going
[55:57] back to school or
[55:59] you know it's it's amazing sometimes
[56:01] when you when you try to do do something
[56:03] for god or god does something for you
[56:06] rather it's amazing how
[56:08] it's almost immediately persecution
[56:10] begins to follow amen you know and
[56:12] sometimes it's you do something you know
[56:14] god god leads you a certain way and you
[56:16] do exactly what what god wants you to do
[56:18] and next thing you know you're met with
[56:20] persecution and many times it's often
[56:22] sometimes friendly fire
[56:24] um you know so so whoever this is for
[56:26] and we're just gonna do a little bible
[56:28] study tonight so it may be a little
[56:29] different normally than what i'm
[56:32] what i'm used to but but we'll just pray
[56:34] that god will just touch us this evening
[56:35] but john chapter nine and verse one and
[56:38] and as jesus passed by
[56:40] he saw a man which was blind from his
[56:42] birth and his disciples asked him saying
[56:45] master who did sin
[56:47] this man or his parents that he was born
[56:49] blind
[56:51] and jesus answered neither hath this man
[56:53] sin nor his parents but the works of god
[56:55] should be made manifest in him so so
[56:58] with that we'll just bow our heads this
[57:00] uh this evening maybe if you have an
[57:02] unspoken request if you just want to
[57:03] make that known
[57:05] amen and also remember sister sister
[57:07] gene and brother robert and the family
[57:08] there i believe brother ben's with him
[57:10] now but let's just say a special prayer
[57:12] for them as well
[57:13] dear lord we just come before you this
[57:15] this evening just just expecting to hear
[57:18] from you
[57:19] or we know that lord that if you don't
[57:21] come lord that this this gathering
[57:23] together lord not that it would be
[57:24] pointless but lord that we don't want it
[57:27] to be in vain lord because our main
[57:28] purpose today is just to hear from you
[57:30] and and to just commune with you and god
[57:33] you see the needs that were mentioned
[57:36] lord during service and this morning and
[57:38] those that are unspoken this afternoon
[57:40] and and for sister gene and brother
[57:41] robert and them as they are as they're
[57:43] around her this evening god we just pray
[57:45] you would send them a special touch and
[57:48] lord that is the word would go forth
[57:50] lord these unspoken requests and those
[57:51] that are sick lord that that as the word
[57:53] would come forth it would go and it
[57:55] would discern the thoughts and intents
[57:56] and and hearts of the people lord that
[57:59] you would meet those needs tonight and
[58:01] god we pray lord you just move me aside
[58:02] and come and speak to your children that
[58:04] whatever would be said lord that would
[58:06] just glorify you lord that none of my
[58:08] thoughts or ideas would be interjected
[58:10] but it would all just be your word in
[58:12] jesus christ's name we pray amen
[58:15] amen you can have your seats and
[58:19] and so
[58:20] i will i will give you the definition of
[58:22] this word manifest it means plain open
[58:24] it's clearly visible to the eye and it's
[58:27] obvious to the understanding
[58:29] so we see that here in verse 1 as jesus
[58:32] passed by he saw a man that was blind
[58:34] from his birth and his disciples asked
[58:36] him saying master who did sin
[58:39] this man or his parents that he was born
[58:41] blind and and a lot of us brother
[58:43] branham talks about this occasionally he
[58:45] says you know he says a lot of people
[58:47] associate sin with or associate things
[58:50] going wrong or sickness or or things
[58:52] going wrong in somebody's life with sin
[58:54] and he says many times that's not the
[58:55] case and he talks about even brother
[58:57] branham talks about the time whenever he
[58:59] had the accident with a gun or what it
[59:01] was and he said you know people
[59:02] attribute that to sin in his life and
[59:04] and so you see many times that just
[59:06] because somebody's going through a
[59:07] difficult time or going through a
[59:08] hardship it doesn't mean that there's
[59:10] sin there but you know that god's
[59:12] actually doing something in their life
[59:14] and and you know i read a quote one time
[59:16] a man said he asked god for strength and
[59:18] god gave him struggles because he can't
[59:20] be strong without fighting is that right
[59:22] you know we can't sit back and say well
[59:24] god i want you to give me this and
[59:25] expect god to just give you the outcome
[59:28] of that situation but he's got to give
[59:30] you the trials to go through to make you
[59:32] strong is that right
[59:35] now and jesus answered neither this
[59:36] man's sin nor his parents but that the
[59:38] works of god might be made manifest in
[59:41] him and so we see that these works of
[59:43] god that word manifest it's clear it's
[59:45] visible it's very obvious so to speak so
[59:49] we see that this man was blind from
[59:50] birth simply so that the works of god
[59:52] could be very visible in his life very
[59:55] very clear to the understanding and
[59:58] jesus goes on and says in verse four he
[1:00:00] says i must work
[1:00:01] i must work the works of him that has
[1:00:04] sent me
[1:00:05] while it is day the night cometh when no
[1:00:07] man can work he said as long as i am in
[1:00:09] the world i am the light of the world
[1:00:12] he said and when he is when he had thus
[1:00:14] spoken he sped on the ground and made
[1:00:15] the clay of spittle and he anointed the
[1:00:17] eyes of the blind man with clay and he
[1:00:19] said unto him go and wash in the pool of
[1:00:21] shalom which is interpretation sent and
[1:00:24] he went forth therefore and washed and
[1:00:27] came seen so we see that
[1:00:29] that god that jesus came here and he
[1:00:31] gave the he gave the direction that this
[1:00:33] man should go he gave the word the the
[1:00:36] as our pastor preached this morning no
[1:00:38] faith cometh by hearing this man heard
[1:00:41] the word that was given to him and then
[1:00:42] he obeyed the word is that right so it's
[1:00:45] not it's not just good enough that we
[1:00:46] can hear the word it's not good enough
[1:00:48] that we can just be in the presence of
[1:00:49] of a minister or of a prophet or the
[1:00:52] tapes but we've actually got to do what
[1:00:54] those things say is that right we've got
[1:00:56] to actually bring it into action so if i
[1:00:59] was to tell my to tell my children to go
[1:01:01] and do something it's good that they
[1:01:02] heard that and maybe they even listened
[1:01:04] and understood it and could comprehend
[1:01:06] it but until they go and actually
[1:01:07] fulfill what i said they actually did
[1:01:09] not they did not actually do it it was
[1:01:11] not manifested until that's done and so
[1:01:14] we see
[1:01:15] dealing with kind of the young people
[1:01:16] tonight or this that's where my thoughts
[1:01:19] going with the young people going back
[1:01:20] to school and i was just kind of
[1:01:21] thinking on that and thinking about when
[1:01:23] i was in high school and all the things
[1:01:25] that i battled and i just couldn't
[1:01:26] imagine what the the children of today
[1:01:28] battled and and you know uh you know i
[1:01:30] went through high school without the
[1:01:32] holy ghost and it was just ups and downs
[1:01:34] ups and downs back and forth and and you
[1:01:36] know as i was looking at this you know
[1:01:38] the main thing is to is to be filled
[1:01:40] with the holy ghost amen i believe if
[1:01:42] you're going to fight the battle of this
[1:01:43] day or fight in this age you've got to
[1:01:45] have him on your side is that right now
[1:01:48] i can tell you this i haven't done
[1:01:49] everything right and don't don't pertain
[1:01:51] to but but i hope tonight this will just
[1:01:53] bless you a little bit because once
[1:01:54] you're filled with the holy ghost one
[1:01:56] thing i realize is
[1:01:57] cause that's when the battle really
[1:01:59] starts now it's a different type of
[1:02:00] battle and it's uh you know for young
[1:02:02] people you begin to fight different
[1:02:04] things in different ways and but we see
[1:02:06] that the outcome is for the works of god
[1:02:08] to be manifested in our lives is that
[1:02:10] right i believe as christians it's our
[1:02:12] desire to manifest what god has his will
[1:02:16] for our life it's our desire to manifest
[1:02:18] that for him if he wants us to be a
[1:02:20] minister if he wants us to be a singer
[1:02:21] if he wants us to be a lay member
[1:02:23] whatever he would have us to be a sunday
[1:02:25] school teacher if he'd want us to be the
[1:02:27] janitor at the church if he'd be want us
[1:02:29] to be the one that gets here early and
[1:02:30] blows off the sidewalks whatever god
[1:02:32] wants us to be we've got to be that is
[1:02:35] that right and and so i wanted to kind
[1:02:37] of show the young people a little bit
[1:02:39] you know how important position is right
[1:02:42] you know it's very important whenever
[1:02:44] you've heard you've heard brother
[1:02:45] branham tell the story of when a kid
[1:02:46] gets out on the road and
[1:02:48] and you know the pair doesn't just say
[1:02:50] well hey little johnny come out of the
[1:02:51] road if there's a car coming they begin
[1:02:53] to scream they begin to do everything
[1:02:55] that that's possible and so it's very
[1:02:56] important that we stay in position is
[1:02:58] that right yes all right so it's
[1:03:01] important if i get out of position at
[1:03:03] work i'm a lender and if i just decide
[1:03:06] tomorrow that i should just open
[1:03:07] checking accounts then the bank's going
[1:03:09] to go in a different term because i'm
[1:03:10] doing something that i'm not supposed to
[1:03:12] do is that right if you know if if i
[1:03:14] tried to pastor that would be a very bad
[1:03:16] thing everybody would leave you know
[1:03:18] that's not my position that's not my
[1:03:19] calling and so we've got to understand
[1:03:21] as ministers we got to stay in our lane
[1:03:23] as lay members we've got to stay in our
[1:03:25] lane as young people we've got to stay
[1:03:26] in our lane and it's where god leads
[1:03:28] it's not where man leads us is that
[1:03:30] right and
[1:03:31] and so you know to to see
[1:03:33] you know i wanted to kind of show with a
[1:03:35] show show the young people what it's
[1:03:36] like to be in position and i've done
[1:03:39] this before but i want the musicians to
[1:03:41] come up again whoever was playing before
[1:03:43] service but i want you to move one
[1:03:45] instrument to the left
[1:03:47] actually that won't work with the piano
[1:03:48] and the organist so you get on the bass
[1:03:52] you can get on the organ you get on the
[1:03:53] piano
[1:03:55] stuart
[1:03:56] you get on the organ
[1:03:58] where's allison
[1:04:00] all right
[1:04:02] and so the important of being in
[1:04:03] position is our our musicians here are
[1:04:05] really really good you all agree
[1:04:08] y'all agree yeah you get on the piano
[1:04:09] you get on the violin stuart let's hear
[1:04:11] that
[1:04:13] so turn on your instruments all right
[1:04:16] and so now now young people you can be
[1:04:18] in the right location right the right
[1:04:20] vicinity the right church
[1:04:23] the right youth group
[1:04:25] everything but if you're out of position
[1:04:28] it's not going to go very well is that
[1:04:29] right
[1:04:30] all right if if me and joel decide
[1:04:32] tomorrow we're going to go do our own
[1:04:34] thing we're going to we're going to
[1:04:35] we're going to jump in on this we're
[1:04:36] going to tell everybody this is what
[1:04:37] we're doing this is what's going to
[1:04:39] happen it'll go to pieces if god doesn't
[1:04:41] guide you if you don't stay where god is
[1:04:44] leading you
[1:04:45] it's going to throw everything else off
[1:04:46] so we've got all these musicians are
[1:04:48] very good they can all play instruments
[1:04:50] we know that we've heard them
[1:04:52] but that doesn't mean that they can play
[1:04:54] anything they want to play right
[1:04:57] we're going to turn you on to make sure
[1:04:58] it's really really good
[1:05:00] so we're going to sing ain't got good
[1:05:01] and we're going to see how everybody
[1:05:02] does all right
[1:05:03] key of g even though none of y'all
[1:05:05] probably know which one that is make
[1:05:07] sure we get stuart very loud on this
[1:05:10] ain't got good
[1:05:12] to give us so many blessings undeserving
[1:05:18] that's what we are
[1:05:20] see it's terrible
[1:05:23] even if you've got one in the right spot
[1:05:25] right you've got one that actually knows
[1:05:27] what they're doing on that instrument
[1:05:29] if three other ones are off
[1:05:31] it doesn't work
[1:05:33] so if we were to actually put someone
[1:05:34] else on the right and now all y'all get
[1:05:36] to your right instruments if you if you
[1:05:38] don't mind
[1:05:39] and so when one person maybe we've got
[1:05:41] the pastors in the right lane but the
[1:05:43] whole church is just out of chaos and in
[1:05:45] all kinds of sorts and we're fussing
[1:05:46] we're fighting with each other
[1:05:48] well how's the church ever supposed to
[1:05:50] go anywhere right
[1:05:52] if one of us gets out of line and so we
[1:05:53] have to see how important it is for all
[1:05:56] of us to be in our right position when
[1:05:58] we come to church it's important that we
[1:06:00] come in the right attitude right
[1:06:02] right brother ben said i could let y'all
[1:06:05] off easy tonight so i'm trying my best
[1:06:07] you if you just correspond with me we'll
[1:06:09] be in and out of here but if we come in
[1:06:10] the wrong spirit it can throw off the
[1:06:12] atmosphere of the church is that right
[1:06:14] we know that we know that brother
[1:06:15] branham brother branham showed us that
[1:06:17] he he taught us that we know that that's
[1:06:18] that's the way the spirit of god works
[1:06:20] any little thing can throw that off is
[1:06:22] that right now we've got everybody in
[1:06:24] the position now we can sing ain't got
[1:06:26] good oh ain't got good
[1:06:29] to give us so many blessings undeserving
[1:06:35] that's what we are
[1:06:38] we ought to thank him
[1:06:41] love and praise him a little more today
[1:06:45] and a whole lot more tomorrow
[1:06:49] so give give them a
[1:06:51] hand clapper y'all can go now
[1:06:55] but you see how important it is for us
[1:06:57] to be in position and so this blind man
[1:07:00] what always amazed me is is how as soon
[1:07:03] as he begins to do what god told him to
[1:07:05] do that's when the opposition actually
[1:07:07] come and at that time it came from other
[1:07:09] church folks so to speak i won't say
[1:07:12] christians but it come from other people
[1:07:14] now we see that god or jesus tells this
[1:07:16] man exactly what to do tells him where
[1:07:19] to go tells him what to do when he gets
[1:07:21] there and he told him that when he gets
[1:07:23] done doing that he would see and so this
[1:07:25] man he does this he comes back seen and
[1:07:28] so we see that the neighbors therefore
[1:07:30] we're going to go on down to verse 8 the
[1:07:31] neighbors therefore and they which
[1:07:33] before had seen him
[1:07:35] that he was blind said it is not he that
[1:07:37] he said is not this he that set and
[1:07:40] begged
[1:07:41] and so
[1:07:42] look at them and they're like is this
[1:07:43] not the guy who used to sit at the gate
[1:07:45] and beg is this not him and some said
[1:07:47] this is he
[1:07:48] and others said he is like him but then
[1:07:51] we noticed the the the man said no he
[1:07:54] said i am he i'm the one that used to
[1:07:56] sit at the gate and beg and and so young
[1:07:58] people there's going to come a time
[1:07:59] where you've got to speak up and say hey
[1:08:01] this is me you know i was the one i once
[1:08:03] was blind but now i see i once was dead
[1:08:05] but now i live and and so you see
[1:08:07] there's going to come a time where
[1:08:08] you've got to testify about what god has
[1:08:10] done in your life and
[1:08:12] and so
[1:08:13] and it said it said therefore said they
[1:08:15] unto him how were thine eyes opened
[1:08:19] and you know it's it's funny when you
[1:08:20] when you when you you have someone who
[1:08:22] comes into the house of god and
[1:08:25] and and you know maybe they've had a
[1:08:26] rough past or a rough a rough
[1:08:30] upbringing or whatever they've done
[1:08:31] maybe they've been in and out of church
[1:08:32] but we always want them to know this is
[1:08:34] a safe harbor to come back to right this
[1:08:36] is a rock that they can run to and i
[1:08:38] think it's important that we that we we
[1:08:40] let our young people know that that if
[1:08:42] you leave here and you're full of the
[1:08:44] holy ghost we know that you're going to
[1:08:45] be okay
[1:08:47] right is that right we know that
[1:08:48] whenever we send our children out as we
[1:08:50] prayed over everybody this morning going
[1:08:52] back to school we know that god is going
[1:08:54] to watch over them he's going to protect
[1:08:56] them but i think you know we've got to
[1:08:57] make a point too that you know that this
[1:09:00] is the place if you if someone's not
[1:09:02] full of the holy ghost if somebody goes
[1:09:04] out we need to let them know that they
[1:09:06] need to come back to this place amen we
[1:09:08] need to let them know that we're not
[1:09:10] going to we are going to we we want to
[1:09:11] see the fruits of the spirit is that
[1:09:13] right we want to we want to see young
[1:09:15] people save but if you go out and make a
[1:09:17] mistake don't think that everybody here
[1:09:18] hates you is that right not everybody in
[1:09:20] the message is hating you or or things
[1:09:22] like that but we want you to come back
[1:09:24] and make it right is that right
[1:09:26] and he answered and said a man that has
[1:09:28] called jesus made clay and anointed my
[1:09:30] eyes and said go to the pool of siloam
[1:09:32] and wash i went and washed and received
[1:09:35] sight so he tells the people here he
[1:09:37] says you know
[1:09:38] i was given the word of the lord i
[1:09:40] obeyed the word of the lord and the word
[1:09:42] of the lord actually healed my eyes and
[1:09:44] i come back seeing amen
[1:09:51] now brother branham says in the token he
[1:09:52] says and when
[1:09:54] we can display the token of the holy
[1:09:56] spirit he said it shows that we've been
[1:09:57] accepted in christ
[1:09:59] and that is our token
[1:10:01] that all we have need of is already
[1:10:03] purchased by him do you believe that so
[1:10:06] everything that we have need of for this
[1:10:07] journey has already been purchased says
[1:10:09] we are identified with our token he said
[1:10:12] the token must be ready the blood the
[1:10:14] covenant blood is not recognized without
[1:10:16] the token he said the word assures us of
[1:10:19] the promise the token is the sign of the
[1:10:21] purchase has been made for us he said
[1:10:23] full obedience to the word of god
[1:10:25] entitles us to the token he says no
[1:10:27] other way is there that you could ever
[1:10:30] be entitled to the token until you fully
[1:10:32] obey the word
[1:10:34] he said not what somebody has put into
[1:10:36] it or added to it but what god
[1:10:39] said about it and i love this someone
[1:10:40] said you know when you when you accept
[1:10:42] that ticket not only does it show where
[1:10:44] you're going but it also shows that you
[1:10:46] accepted the price that was paid for
[1:10:48] that ticket so it's not only showing you
[1:10:50] where you're going but you fully
[1:10:51] accepted the price that it cost for that
[1:10:53] ticket
[1:10:54] now john in john chapter 14 says here it
[1:10:58] says he that hath my commandments and
[1:11:00] keepeth him he is it that loveth me and
[1:11:03] he that loveth me shall be loved of my
[1:11:05] father and i will love him and will
[1:11:06] manifest
[1:11:08] myself to him and so that word if we
[1:11:10] remember correctly in the beginning it
[1:11:12] makes him visible to us it makes it
[1:11:14] makes us understand who christ is is
[1:11:16] that right and that's what the holy
[1:11:18] ghost does you know you look at what
[1:11:19] brother branham did as a restoration
[1:11:21] prophet when he come it wasn't that he
[1:11:23] was bringing new things in but he tied
[1:11:25] all the loose ends together and it was
[1:11:27] through that that you and i that
[1:11:28] revelation was able to come and you and
[1:11:30] i could see who we were in this word is
[1:11:33] that right
[1:11:34] said he that loveth me shall be loved to
[1:11:35] my father i will love him and i will
[1:11:37] manifest myself to him and it says judas
[1:11:40] said unto him not iscariot lord how will
[1:11:43] how is it that thou will manifest
[1:11:45] thyself unto us
[1:11:46] and not unto the world
[1:11:48] and he said jesus answered and said unto
[1:11:50] him if a man love me he will keep my
[1:11:52] words and my father will love him and we
[1:11:55] will come unto him and make our abode
[1:11:58] with him he that loveth me not keepeth
[1:12:00] not my sayings and the word which you
[1:12:02] hear is not mine but the father which
[1:12:05] has sent me
[1:12:06] now when judas asked this question how
[1:12:10] is it that thou will manifest thyselves
[1:12:12] on thyself unto us
[1:12:15] jesus didn't actually say what i'm going
[1:12:17] to do to show that i'm manifested
[1:12:19] he actually said this is what the
[1:12:21] believers gonna do when they understand
[1:12:23] when they see that i've been manifested
[1:12:25] to them and so he said if a man love me
[1:12:27] and will keep my words and keep my
[1:12:29] commandments so we know that the people
[1:12:31] who are who are going to church and
[1:12:33] saying they love god and they're doing
[1:12:34] this and they're worshiping in vain if
[1:12:36] they do not keep his commandments and
[1:12:37] follow his word we know that god has not
[1:12:40] been manifested christ has not been
[1:12:41] manifested to those people
[1:12:44] so we see we must keep his commandments
[1:12:45] for him to be manifested in our lives
[1:12:47] and brother branham in 1955 in the
[1:12:49] curtain of time he says that's the thing
[1:12:51] tonight he said quit arguing religions
[1:12:53] could argue in different phases and
[1:12:55] arguing different church denominations
[1:12:57] and different nations and the world
[1:12:58] needs to know tonight that jesus has
[1:13:00] risen from the dead
[1:13:02] and said that he lives among men he says
[1:13:04] amen not to argue about this or pinpoint
[1:13:07] this or cut this out or move this and
[1:13:09] inspired this and just forget he says
[1:13:11] look up to him and believe he was raised
[1:13:14] from the dead and he will manifest
[1:13:16] himself to you and that's what we want
[1:13:18] is jesus to manifest himself to us is
[1:13:20] that right
[1:13:21] he said amen he said it's just that
[1:13:23] simple he says well if an angel was
[1:13:24] preaching that he said no no he said god
[1:13:26] didn't ordain angels to preach the
[1:13:29] gospel he ordained men to preach the
[1:13:31] gospel he never said to angels i'll be
[1:13:33] with you and in you he said to men i'll
[1:13:35] be with you and in you he never said to
[1:13:37] angels he said the things that i do
[1:13:39] you'll also do but he said to men the
[1:13:42] things that i do you'll also do he says
[1:13:44] the gospel comes of the preaching of the
[1:13:46] word of god he said god will manifest
[1:13:48] himself through human beings so we see
[1:13:51] that you know god is going to manifest
[1:13:53] himself to this age somehow is that
[1:13:56] right
[1:13:57] he goes on and he says the only eyes god
[1:13:59] has got on the earth tonight is mine and
[1:14:01] yours the only hands he has is our hands
[1:14:05] he said god is working in his people god
[1:14:07] is in the universe and god is in his
[1:14:09] word he said god is in his son and god
[1:14:12] is in his people so we see that the only
[1:14:14] way that god can work in this day is
[1:14:17] through you and i is that right that you
[1:14:19] and i would be the actual people the
[1:14:21] actual bride that is going to manifest
[1:14:24] christ to the world and show that we do
[1:14:26] serve a living god is that right i
[1:14:29] quoted it the other day when i think
[1:14:30] after song service but you know they
[1:14:32] they went through and looked at some of
[1:14:34] the quotes before some of the great
[1:14:36] prophets died and just through history
[1:14:38] and and you know i think um uh i think
[1:14:40] it was buddha that said peace is the way
[1:14:42] or love is the way and then another one
[1:14:45] said you know peace is the way and and
[1:14:47] confucius actually said you know i am
[1:14:49] not the way and i do not know the way
[1:14:51] and then but jesus christ come and said
[1:14:53] i am the way and so we know that when
[1:14:55] jesus was here we know that that was the
[1:14:58] way to get to god is that right you know
[1:15:00] it was the second adam that come was not
[1:15:02] gonna we weren't gonna be like the first
[1:15:04] adam it wasn't gonna be like the first
[1:15:05] eve but he was gonna have a bride that
[1:15:07] was not gonna fall to satan is that
[1:15:09] right
[1:15:10] now john chapter 15 and verse 7 it says
[1:15:12] if you abide in me and my words in you
[1:15:15] you shall ask what ye will and it shall
[1:15:17] be done
[1:15:18] unto you so we see we must obey his word
[1:15:22] do you love the lord this evening
[1:15:26] and then we're going to kind of jump
[1:15:27] back into this this john chapter 9 real
[1:15:30] quick and we'll pick up at verse 12 and
[1:15:33] and so we see that when they had then
[1:15:35] they said unto him where is he and he
[1:15:37] said i know not so
[1:15:39] the people are coming and saying where's
[1:15:40] this jesus that healed you right and so
[1:15:42] they're coming back to him and they they
[1:15:44] brought the pharisees
[1:15:46] to him that aforetime was blind and
[1:15:49] and it was that the sabbath day when
[1:15:50] jesus made the clay and opened his eyes
[1:15:52] and then again the pharisees also asked
[1:15:55] him how he had received his sight and
[1:15:58] said unto them he put clay upon my eyes
[1:16:00] and i washed and do see and and so you
[1:16:03] see it's very fun to me funny to me that
[1:16:05] the religion of that day began to
[1:16:07] question you know how did you receive
[1:16:09] your sight they weren't rejoicing that
[1:16:10] he received his sight they wanted to
[1:16:12] know you know how did this happen
[1:16:14] and therefore had said some of the
[1:16:15] pharisees this man is not of god because
[1:16:17] he keepeth not the sabbath day and then
[1:16:20] others said how can a man that is a
[1:16:22] sinner do such miracles and there was
[1:16:24] division among them and so they began to
[1:16:27] decide you know was you know jesus can't
[1:16:29] be of he he can't be of god or god made
[1:16:31] flesh because we know that he can't do
[1:16:33] this on the sabbath day this is just not
[1:16:35] right and and so they begin to argue
[1:16:37] amongst himself because a sinner should
[1:16:39] not be able to open the eyes of a blind
[1:16:41] man and they begin to argue a little bit
[1:16:43] as we heard brother branham say we don't
[1:16:45] need to argue over the little things but
[1:16:47] they begin to do that and
[1:16:49] and they said unto the blind man again
[1:16:50] what sayest thou of him
[1:16:53] and young people that are going back to
[1:16:54] school it's always amazed me that that
[1:16:57] even if even if you're trying to hide
[1:16:59] you know many times in my in my
[1:17:01] christian experience
[1:17:02] maybe i wouldn't bring up god to anybody
[1:17:04] i wouldn't bring up the message to
[1:17:05] anybody i wouldn't bring up the bible
[1:17:07] but somehow
[1:17:08] people know that you're a little bit
[1:17:10] different and and they will begin to ask
[1:17:13] what do you say about this
[1:17:15] and and you can't help it if there's if
[1:17:17] there's a seed on the inside you're
[1:17:18] going to be questioned at some point
[1:17:20] what do you say about this and it's
[1:17:23] going to happen so i think the best way
[1:17:25] to do is just be prepared to answer that
[1:17:27] question amen and i believe as a
[1:17:30] christian you won't be caught off guard
[1:17:31] you'll exactly know what to say of him
[1:17:33] and and so this blind man he said
[1:17:36] he they said what sayest thou of him
[1:17:38] that that hath opened thine eyes and he
[1:17:40] said he is a prophet
[1:17:42] and so we see that the blind man said
[1:17:44] well he he was a prophet that's that's
[1:17:46] what i know about him and and that's
[1:17:48] that's that's just what i know him but
[1:17:49] the jews did not believe concerning him
[1:17:52] that he had been blind and received his
[1:17:54] side until they called the parents of
[1:17:56] him
[1:17:57] that have received his sight so they
[1:17:59] begin to not believe the blind man right
[1:18:01] he testified told a little bit about
[1:18:03] what he knew and told told a little bit
[1:18:05] about what he thought about jesus and
[1:18:07] they're like you know what we're really
[1:18:08] not going to believe you till we
[1:18:09] actually see your parents we want to
[1:18:11] know that you were blind
[1:18:13] and so they asked them saying is this
[1:18:14] your son
[1:18:16] who you say was born blind how how then
[1:18:19] doth he see
[1:18:22] and his parents answered them and said
[1:18:23] we know that this is our son
[1:18:26] and that he was born blind
[1:18:28] but by what means he now seeth we know
[1:18:30] not
[1:18:31] or what hath opened his eyes we know not
[1:18:34] he is of age ask him
[1:18:36] he shall speak for himself and i want
[1:18:38] you to know there comes a time when when
[1:18:40] mom and dad can't get you out of trouble
[1:18:42] right there's going to come a time when
[1:18:43] when mom and dad's going to say you know
[1:18:45] i'm taking my hands away from this this
[1:18:47] is your life this is what you're going
[1:18:48] to do and and we see that when that time
[1:18:50] comes it's going to come back to you as
[1:18:53] an individual it's going to come back to
[1:18:54] you what do you say and what's amazing
[1:18:57] to me is these people were not going to
[1:18:58] leave this alone and that's the way the
[1:19:00] devil is he is not going to leave it
[1:19:02] alone until you give answer amen he's
[1:19:05] going to trace you down and chase you
[1:19:07] down until you give answer he's going to
[1:19:09] constantly try to see whose side you're
[1:19:12] on is that right
[1:19:14] he said these words spake his parents
[1:19:16] because they feared the jews
[1:19:19] and so i love this part because the his
[1:19:21] parents were a little on the religious
[1:19:23] side
[1:19:24] right
[1:19:25] and he says for the jews had agreed
[1:19:27] already that if any man did confess that
[1:19:29] he was christ he should be put out of
[1:19:31] the synagogue so they were like well we
[1:19:33] don't want to get kicked out of church
[1:19:35] so we're just going to stay out of this
[1:19:37] let our son handle it he's a big boy he
[1:19:39] can do it and and there said therefore
[1:19:41] said his parents he is of age ask him
[1:19:43] and then again they called the man that
[1:19:44] was blind and said unto him give god
[1:19:47] praise we know that this man is a sinner
[1:19:49] so they come up to him and they're
[1:19:51] saying listen we know you've testified
[1:19:52] we know you've done this but we want you
[1:19:54] to give god praise because we know that
[1:19:56] that jesus is not of god we want you to
[1:19:58] we want you to testify of what we want
[1:20:00] to see
[1:20:02] and so he answered and said whether he
[1:20:03] be a sinner or no i know not but the one
[1:20:06] thing i know wherein i was blind now i
[1:20:08] see so he's testifying he's like i i
[1:20:11] can't answer these questions and i can't
[1:20:13] do this or i can't do that but one thing
[1:20:15] i know is that when i met him i was
[1:20:17] changed after i met him and so i want
[1:20:20] you to know we may not always be able to
[1:20:21] give the correct answer or this or quote
[1:20:23] this or quote that but you know when you
[1:20:26] walk away from him you know you've been
[1:20:28] changed amen you know that you've been
[1:20:30] different since the day that you've met
[1:20:32] him
[1:20:33] now he answered and said whether he be a
[1:20:35] sinner i don't know that but where and i
[1:20:36] was blind now i see and they said unto
[1:20:38] him again
[1:20:40] what did he to thee how opened he
[1:20:43] thine eyes and he answered them and he
[1:20:45] said i told you already and you did not
[1:20:47] hear
[1:20:48] wherefore would you hear it again will
[1:20:50] he will ye also be his disciples
[1:20:53] so he's saying you know why do you keep
[1:20:55] are you asking me so that you can follow
[1:20:57] him too are you asking me so that you
[1:20:59] can know him in the way that i know him
[1:21:02] then they reviled him and said thou art
[1:21:04] his disciple but we are moses disciple
[1:21:08] and i don't know if you remember here a
[1:21:09] few weeks ago brother ben was preaching
[1:21:11] about
[1:21:12] about the children of israel coming up
[1:21:13] to the promised land and and they come
[1:21:16] up to the promised land and they were
[1:21:17] going to send spies over
[1:21:19] right you know the story and they sent
[1:21:20] the spies over there were 12 spies and
[1:21:23] and they come back and they give an evil
[1:21:25] report 10 of them gave an evil report of
[1:21:27] the land do you remember that
[1:21:29] the first time i think he was
[1:21:30] ministering the first time i ever
[1:21:32] realized that moses selected those men
[1:21:35] that was the first time i ever realized
[1:21:36] that moses had selected those men i just
[1:21:38] thought they were just they were heads
[1:21:40] of the tribes or whatnot and they were
[1:21:41] the men that were supposed to go and
[1:21:43] and so you know i began to think on that
[1:21:45] a little bit and begin to think you know
[1:21:46] it really doesn't matter who men picks
[1:21:49] it doesn't matter you know if
[1:21:51] moses picked these men to go over and
[1:21:53] the children of israel should have went
[1:21:55] to the promised land but they come back
[1:21:56] and gave a bad report and what i
[1:21:58] realized is is people under the prophet
[1:22:01] that maybe were even close to him or
[1:22:03] around him may not have the same vision
[1:22:05] that the prophet had the the men that he
[1:22:07] sent over didn't have the same vision
[1:22:08] that moses had or didn't have the same
[1:22:10] vision that joshua or caleb had or and
[1:22:13] so we see that just because they're
[1:22:15] picked by men doesn't mean that they
[1:22:16] were picked by god is that right you
[1:22:18] know i i could fall tomorrow maybe
[1:22:20] brother ben would pick another minister
[1:22:22] you know another minister would come in
[1:22:23] and he could fall tomorrow or jewel or
[1:22:25] anybody could fall tomorrow but as it
[1:22:27] doesn't change the vision that god has
[1:22:30] it may change the vision that you and i
[1:22:31] have i may pick someone tomorrow and
[1:22:33] they may fall and go by the way but that
[1:22:35] but but god knows it the end from the
[1:22:38] beginning he knows exactly what's going
[1:22:40] to happen
[1:22:41] and you know i began to look at this as
[1:22:42] i was studying on this because i just
[1:22:43] couldn't get away from it
[1:22:45] it was amazing to me you know how how
[1:22:47] brother ben was preaching on jonah and
[1:22:48] the well and or jonah and the fish
[1:22:50] rather and he talked about god preparing
[1:22:53] a fish to swallow jonah
[1:22:55] and so you know you think god was just
[1:22:57] preparing jonah and all this but he was
[1:22:59] actually preparing a fish to take jonah
[1:23:01] to nineveh god was not called out of
[1:23:03] swords he didn't have to create at the
[1:23:05] last second of fish to do this the fish
[1:23:07] god already knew what jonah was going to
[1:23:09] do and then you know i began to look at
[1:23:11] that and begin to look at this here and
[1:23:14] i began to think about esther and so
[1:23:15] while i was in the back i just went and
[1:23:17] read the book and and you know god was
[1:23:19] preparing to save a people
[1:23:21] and so
[1:23:22] before haman ever come along he put
[1:23:25] esther in position to save the jews is
[1:23:27] that right so we we know that haman was
[1:23:30] coming he was on his way but god was
[1:23:32] going to find a way to save his people
[1:23:35] and so we see here that god is always
[1:23:37] going to find a way to bring out his
[1:23:39] will maybe it's you know you understand
[1:23:41] perfect will and permissive will but god
[1:23:43] is always going to find a way to bring
[1:23:45] out his will and it's going to come to
[1:23:47] pass we know that that god cannot be
[1:23:49] defeated he's never been defeated down
[1:23:51] through history and he's not in the
[1:23:53] losing business now he's not going to be
[1:23:55] defeated in this age for sure so we know
[1:23:58] that god's will is going to come to pass
[1:24:00] and so these men they say well we we're
[1:24:02] moses's disciples you know we're we're
[1:24:05] we're a little bit better than you
[1:24:06] you're jesus is but we're moses
[1:24:08] disciples and and so we see brother
[1:24:10] branham says in 1950 i just found this
[1:24:12] quote and he says now remember
[1:24:14] if you can just take just for a moment
[1:24:16] maybe there's some of you do not
[1:24:17] understand he said frankly friends
[1:24:20] there's much of it that i don't
[1:24:21] understand but i just accept it he says
[1:24:23] he says don't ever try to figure god out
[1:24:25] he said you can't do it he said god is
[1:24:27] not understood by knowledge god is
[1:24:30] understood by faith is that right
[1:24:32] we heard about that this morning he says
[1:24:34] what if peter would have tried to figure
[1:24:36] out how deep the water was
[1:24:38] and how impossible it was for him to
[1:24:39] walk on water he said he would have
[1:24:41] never walked on water he said see says
[1:24:44] and he says but just look at christ and
[1:24:47] he said he just took christ and his word
[1:24:49] and walked out there he says well that's
[1:24:51] the way i did this and i just took him
[1:24:52] at his word he says and there i went he
[1:24:55] says you just take him at his word
[1:24:56] tonight
[1:24:57] and he says if you may be a sinner and
[1:24:59] do not understand how to take god at his
[1:25:01] word he says then god sent me here he
[1:25:03] said i want you to take my word for it
[1:25:05] and see if it doesn't come to pass that
[1:25:07] god will bless you so he's saying you
[1:25:10] understand god by faith because you know
[1:25:12] there's no way to explain how people
[1:25:14] have been healed from cancer is that
[1:25:16] right there's no way to see how people
[1:25:18] have been healed from from from lust or
[1:25:20] been delivered from drugs and delivered
[1:25:22] from these things there's no scientific
[1:25:24] way to nail that down but when you trust
[1:25:26] god and believe and understand him in
[1:25:28] faith you'll take that leap is that
[1:25:30] right
[1:25:31] knowing that he's going to catch you
[1:25:33] on the other side
[1:25:36] amen do you love the lord this evening
[1:25:42] amen i know this is very simple it's a
[1:25:43] sunday school lesson but stay with me
[1:25:45] we're almost we're almost done i know
[1:25:47] the kids are like we already had sunday
[1:25:48] school but here it is again
[1:25:51] amen and i really do i've really really
[1:25:53] been praying for the kids going back to
[1:25:55] school and
[1:25:56] you know just a father of three you know
[1:25:59] i was kind of like you know this is okay
[1:26:00] and then we go to the school the other
[1:26:02] day with jen for parent-teacher
[1:26:03] conference like man maybe this is not
[1:26:04] okay you know
[1:26:06] so you know we just we but we trust the
[1:26:08] lord to take care of him is that right
[1:26:11] amen
[1:26:13] so he answered them said i've told you
[1:26:15] already and you did not hear wherefore
[1:26:16] would you hear it again and also be his
[1:26:18] disciples they reviled him and said thou
[1:26:20] art his disciple but we are moses's
[1:26:23] disciple
[1:26:24] i mean that's the nicest thing they said
[1:26:25] about him was that he was jesus disciple
[1:26:27] that's the only good thing they say
[1:26:28] about him this whole scripture
[1:26:30] he said we know that god spake unto
[1:26:32] moses and as for this fellow we know not
[1:26:34] from whence he is it says the man
[1:26:37] answered and said unto them why hearing
[1:26:39] is a marvelous thing that ye know not
[1:26:41] from whence he is and yet he hath opened
[1:26:44] my eyes
[1:26:45] he said now we know that god here is not
[1:26:47] sinners but if any man be a worshiper of
[1:26:48] god he doth his will
[1:26:50] and he heareth he said since the world
[1:26:52] began was it not heard that any man
[1:26:54] opened the eyes of one that was born
[1:26:56] blind
[1:26:57] he said if this man were not of god he
[1:26:59] could do nothing
[1:27:01] they answered and said unto him
[1:27:03] altogether born in sins and thus thou
[1:27:05] teach us and they cast him out
[1:27:07] and you'll find that when the devil
[1:27:09] doesn't have an answer for you they'll
[1:27:10] just get rid of you
[1:27:12] when they don't have an answer for you
[1:27:13] they just they'll just say get out and
[1:27:15] and jesus heard that they had cast him
[1:27:17] out and when he had found him he said
[1:27:19] unto him dost thou believe on the son of
[1:27:21] god and i think this is one of the the
[1:27:24] the scriptures the verses that has done
[1:27:26] the most for me uh in in my christian
[1:27:28] walk was was once he was cast out you
[1:27:31] immediately see jesus come on the scene
[1:27:33] and so any time that man does away with
[1:27:36] us or man gets rid of us jesus is there
[1:27:39] to pick us up is that right i believe
[1:27:41] that's all down through our christian
[1:27:42] walk if you look down through the
[1:27:44] scripture and you see when men of god
[1:27:46] fell in the bible or maybe went the
[1:27:48] wrong way there was god to pick them
[1:27:50] back up and get them on the straight
[1:27:51] path again is that right now god's not
[1:27:53] gonna come over and just say it's okay
[1:27:55] i'm just gonna you can keep doing this
[1:27:57] it's all right no god's gonna tell you
[1:27:59] what you need to do to get back right
[1:28:01] with him and then you've got to do it is
[1:28:03] that right
[1:28:04] he answered and said
[1:28:06] he says do thou believe on the son of
[1:28:08] god he answered and said who is he lord
[1:28:10] that i might believe on him
[1:28:12] and jesus said unto him thou hast both
[1:28:14] seen him and it is he that talketh with
[1:28:16] thee and he said lord i believe and he
[1:28:19] worshipped him so we see this young
[1:28:21] man's life was changed drastically but
[1:28:24] nobody was giving him problems until god
[1:28:26] began to work in his life and and young
[1:28:28] people and old people alike you can
[1:28:30] testify of this but when god begins to
[1:28:32] do something in your life that's when
[1:28:34] the devil begins to move in and tries to
[1:28:36] bother you tries to do things to you but
[1:28:38] i want you to know there is a rock that
[1:28:40] you can run to amen there's a rock
[1:28:42] there's a there's a savior there's a tie
[1:28:44] post that you can go to that will be
[1:28:46] there when man is gone when your mom is
[1:28:48] gone when your family's gone your wife
[1:28:51] is gone there is a tie post that will be
[1:28:53] there that will hold you in any storm do
[1:28:56] you believe that this evening
[1:28:58] now we see here that i'm just going to
[1:29:00] kind of bring this down to a close here
[1:29:01] in a few minutes but joshua and caleb
[1:29:03] they were obeying the word of god
[1:29:05] knowing that the promised land was
[1:29:07] theirs no matter the size of the giants
[1:29:09] on the other side and and this is just
[1:29:11] another quick example of when brother
[1:29:13] ben was preaching about moses picking
[1:29:15] the spies but but joshua and caleb
[1:29:18] and these 10 other spies were going to
[1:29:20] this land that they knew was rightfully
[1:29:22] theirs they were going with their with
[1:29:24] their fellow believers their fellow uh
[1:29:26] their fellow uh the soldiers that they'd
[1:29:29] been fighting with walking through in
[1:29:30] the desert they were going over there
[1:29:32] but i want you to know not everybody's
[1:29:34] gonna have the same vision
[1:29:36] not everybody's gonna have the same path
[1:29:38] the same life but all i know is that if
[1:29:40] you follow christ he will lead you you
[1:29:43] look and you see caleb and joshua did
[1:29:45] the right thing is that right
[1:29:47] you see they went to the promised land
[1:29:48] they come back and they gave a good
[1:29:50] report and said we are more than able to
[1:29:52] take the land but you see the 10 other
[1:29:54] spies outweighed them and they held them
[1:29:56] back and the children of israel were not
[1:29:57] able to go in at that time because of
[1:30:00] the report that was given but i want you
[1:30:02] to realize joshua and caleb didn't quit
[1:30:04] at that time just because the others
[1:30:06] weren't going through they stood with
[1:30:08] god and and as the others perished as
[1:30:10] they all died in the wilderness joshua
[1:30:12] and caleb god was able to stay with them
[1:30:15] until the end to bring them to the
[1:30:17] promised land because they knew that god
[1:30:19] had promised it and knew that he was
[1:30:20] faithful to bring them through so you
[1:30:23] can see that when everybody else may
[1:30:25] halt the plan of god if you will stay in
[1:30:27] line with god he will bring you where
[1:30:30] you ought to be you believe that this
[1:30:32] evening joshua 1 and 7 it says the only
[1:30:34] be thou strong and very courageous that
[1:30:36] thou mayest observe to do according to
[1:30:39] all the law which moses my servant
[1:30:41] commanded thee said turn not from it to
[1:30:44] the right hand or the left that thou
[1:30:45] mayest prosper wither ever so thou art
[1:30:48] whithersoever thou goest
[1:30:50] he said the book of the law shall not
[1:30:52] depart out thou out of thy mouth he said
[1:30:54] but thou shalt meditate therein day and
[1:30:56] night that thou mayest observe to do
[1:30:59] according to all that is written therein
[1:31:01] and for them thou shalt make thy way
[1:31:03] prosperous and then thou shalt have good
[1:31:06] success he said have not i commanded
[1:31:08] thee be strong and of a good courage be
[1:31:10] not afraid neither be thou dismayed for
[1:31:12] the lord thy god is with thee wither so
[1:31:15] ever thou goest
[1:31:17] so we see how does god manifest himself
[1:31:20] through a believer it's by us hearing
[1:31:22] the word and by faith receiving that
[1:31:24] word and acting upon that word and
[1:31:26] following it through
[1:31:28] to the end you know we see many times in
[1:31:30] our christian walk you know we have ups
[1:31:32] and downs we have ebbs and flows we have
[1:31:34] this and that but if we stick with the
[1:31:36] word of god we know that god will lead
[1:31:38] us
[1:31:39] we know that god will lead us where we
[1:31:40] ought to be you know many times the
[1:31:42] journey may look hard if you look at the
[1:31:44] story of abraham and isaac he was the
[1:31:46] promised son but then he told abraham go
[1:31:48] and sacrifice your promised son and so
[1:31:51] it may not have been clear to abraham
[1:31:52] but abraham by faith followed the word
[1:31:54] of god is that right and what happened
[1:31:57] god provided him a sacrifice he provided
[1:32:00] a ram in the thicket god provided
[1:32:01] himself a sacrifice
[1:32:04] second corinthians chapter four we'll
[1:32:06] just read this real quick he says we are
[1:32:07] troubled on every side yet not
[1:32:08] distressed we are perplexed but not in
[1:32:11] despair
[1:32:12] persecuted but not forsaken cast down
[1:32:15] but not destroyed always bearing about
[1:32:17] the body of the dying of the lord jesus
[1:32:20] that the life also of jesus might be
[1:32:22] made manifest in our body for we which
[1:32:26] live are always delivered unto death for
[1:32:28] jesus sake that the life also of jesus
[1:32:32] might be made manifest in our mortal
[1:32:34] flesh so as believers our desire is for
[1:32:38] us to be the literal fl or to be the
[1:32:40] flesh that jesus is manifested to in
[1:32:43] this day
[1:32:44] that we're going to be different than
[1:32:45] the first eve is that right we're not
[1:32:47] going to fall to satan's life we're
[1:32:48] going to be overcomers we're not going
[1:32:50] to barely get by laodicea but we're
[1:32:52] going to overcome laodicea amen we're
[1:32:54] taking a rapture out of laodicea do you
[1:32:57] love the lord this evening
[1:33:00] brother branham says in the invisible
[1:33:01] union
[1:33:02] in 65 he says if i was supposed to die
[1:33:04] in the morning
[1:33:06] and a man took my place he said i cannot
[1:33:08] die for that sin he said someone took my
[1:33:11] place
[1:33:12] he said in jesus the word took my place
[1:33:14] he become me that a sinner that i might
[1:33:16] become him
[1:33:18] he said the word amen he said let me
[1:33:19] hold true to it not the church but the
[1:33:22] word he said oh that spiritual union and
[1:33:25] i want to stop right there when we hold
[1:33:26] true to the word god will lead us where
[1:33:29] we should go is that right when we hold
[1:33:31] true to the word god will show us
[1:33:33] exactly where we need to be we won't be
[1:33:34] wondering and saying well is this where
[1:33:36] i need to be is this what i need to be
[1:33:38] doing no when we follow the word of god
[1:33:40] it will lead us where we need to be
[1:33:43] god is not a god of chaos he does not
[1:33:45] say well i'm just going to let the
[1:33:46] people figure it out no he's going to
[1:33:48] lead you through the holy spirit to let
[1:33:49] you know where you ought to be and what
[1:33:51] position you ought to be in
[1:33:53] he said he said oh that spiritual union
[1:33:56] of christ and his church now when the
[1:33:57] flesh is becoming word and the word is
[1:33:59] becoming flesh
[1:34:01] manifested vindicated he said just what
[1:34:03] the bible said
[1:34:05] would happen in this day he said it's
[1:34:07] happening
[1:34:08] day by day do you believe that
[1:34:10] he said we say we've got to obey the
[1:34:12] word and god will manifest himself
[1:34:14] through us
[1:34:15] now i want to read this quote and then
[1:34:16] we'll kind of we'll kind of bring it to
[1:34:18] a close this is from 1955 it's the great
[1:34:21] warrior david and
[1:34:24] he said don't leave this building
[1:34:25] tonight
[1:34:27] without having the holy spirit cut away
[1:34:29] the old blind shackle that stands there
[1:34:30] he says throw the thing away so say i
[1:34:32] believe god
[1:34:34] walk out of here like a man or a woman a
[1:34:35] child of god with a victory
[1:34:37] and the morning star leading you
[1:34:39] marching you under glory says the devil
[1:34:41] raised up and said well i thought i had
[1:34:42] you he said say
[1:34:44] i told you i had you bound he said look
[1:34:45] at here you remember me i was the person
[1:34:48] that was up there i was the person
[1:34:49] sitting here and the doctor said i
[1:34:50] couldn't live but a few more days longer
[1:34:52] and here i am yet tonight he said
[1:34:54] hallelujah says then somebody say you
[1:34:56] know if she can do it
[1:34:58] i can too
[1:34:59] he said so i'll trust him he says amen
[1:35:01] you don't know what what's the matter
[1:35:02] tonight he says oh you don't know how
[1:35:04] the holy spirit likes to get into a
[1:35:05] bunch of people like this now he said if
[1:35:07] you could only realize where you're at
[1:35:09] only realize not say in this building
[1:35:11] but you're in christ so we've got to
[1:35:14] realize where we're at in this day it's
[1:35:15] not that we're in the message of the
[1:35:17] hour or we're not we're not doing we're
[1:35:19] under a certain church or we go to a
[1:35:21] certain church or we run with a certain
[1:35:23] group but we've got to realize as every
[1:35:25] believer in every church in the messages
[1:35:28] got to realize that we're in christ
[1:35:31] not that we're in anything else but
[1:35:32] we're in christ he says positionally
[1:35:35] everything is yours all yours it belongs
[1:35:37] to you he says do you now believe so we
[1:35:40] see that once we positionally place
[1:35:42] ourselves or once we're positionally
[1:35:44] placed in jesus christ we are not we are
[1:35:47] not servants we are no longer slaves but
[1:35:49] we are joint heirs with jesus christ so
[1:35:51] everything that he was entitled to you
[1:35:54] and i are now entitled to through the
[1:35:56] blood through that redemption through
[1:35:58] that through that atonement you and i
[1:36:00] are responsible or you and i are given
[1:36:01] everything that christ was given do you
[1:36:04] believe that
[1:36:05] so i say to you this evening
[1:36:07] if you're out of position maybe you're
[1:36:09] out just a little bit get back in line
[1:36:11] because the church will go further the
[1:36:13] bride will go further you will go
[1:36:15] further when you get in position with
[1:36:17] jesus christ
[1:36:19] wherever god god is trying to place you
[1:36:21] get there and stay there and follow his
[1:36:24] word you've got to obey the word you've
[1:36:26] got to hear the word obey the word and
[1:36:28] then god will manifest himself through
[1:36:29] your life do you believe that do you
[1:36:31] love the lord this evening
[1:36:33] i mean we appreciate god coming and
[1:36:35] speaking to us this evening and we'll go
[1:36:37] ahead and have the musicians come at
[1:36:38] this time as we're going to just change
[1:36:40] the order of the service over but
[1:36:42] but i will say this to the young people
[1:36:45] you know
[1:36:46] as many times you know we we want to
[1:36:48] paint the picture that
[1:36:50] that you know the the the house of god
[1:36:52] is no place for sin it's no place for us
[1:36:54] to condone it and say well you can do
[1:36:56] anything you want and be here
[1:36:58] but when you do fall there's a place
[1:37:00] that you can run to that god will pick
[1:37:02] you back up amen there's a place that
[1:37:04] you can go that's just a little bit
[1:37:06] higher than here but that god will lead
[1:37:08] you and guide you and he will pick you
[1:37:10] up i believe the bible says a righteous
[1:37:11] man falls seven times but we know that
[1:37:14] we're not supposed to say to stay down
[1:37:15] but we get up every time is that right
[1:37:18] that we keep getting up we keep moving
[1:37:20] on no matter what the devil throws at us
[1:37:21] we keep getting back up and keep moving
[1:37:24] forward with jesus i mean if you want to
[1:37:27] bow your heads they would just play
[1:37:28] something softly do you know that song
[1:37:32] i want what you want for me could we
[1:37:34] could we play that maybe and sing that a
[1:37:36] few times through
[1:37:39] hey let's just bow our heads as we just
[1:37:41] go to the lord in prayer and

[1:37:57] and downs he's just such a solid brother
[1:37:59] he's been consistent and constant and we
[1:38:01] just appreciate him so much but we want
