[40:02] Christian know that our sins are
[40:04] forgiven Lord that all things are under
[40:06] the blood that Lord that though our sins

[40:11] snow and we're so thankful for that
[40:13] today Lord I pray that you'd help us
[40:16] Lord maybe there's a a need represented
[40:18] here tonight I I know Lord each one goes
[40:21] through a different battle Lord and
[40:23] faces different things I I pray that
[40:25] you'd meet those needs tonight Lord in
[40:28] in the study of your word that maybe
[40:30] somehow you'd speak something maybe
[40:32] unexpectedly that would speak directly
[40:34] to that situation we pray I pray you'd
[40:37] bless us now Lord I I I commit this
[40:40] service into your hands may you work
[40:42] within it Lord and do your good pleasure
[40:45] we pray and we ask it in Jesus name amen
[40:49] God bless you Revelation chapter 10
[40:51] verse
[40:55] one Revel velation
[40:57] 101 read down through verse
[41:06] three got our Thanksgiving
[41:10] potluck this Sunday I'm looking forward
[41:12] to that brother Matt McGary will be here
[41:14] with us and preaching the word in both
[41:16] services and uh so we'll just have a
[41:19] good time in the Lord and um I'm always
[41:22] look forward to this time of year but I
[41:25] wish it would stay cold or hide one or
[41:27] the other it really messes with my voice
[41:30] when we have to deal with the weather
[41:32] change but that's what I blame it on
[41:34] anyway but uh we're just in bodies of
[41:36] corruption isn't that right and one of
[41:39] these days we're going to be clothed on
[41:40] with immortality and looking forward to
[41:43] that Revelation
[41:48] 101 as I saw another Mighty Angel come
[41:51] down from
[41:52] heaven clothed with a cloud a rainbow
[41:55] was upon his head his face was as it
[41:57] were the sun his feet as pillars of fire
[42:00] and he had in his hand a little book
[42:03] open he set his right foot upon the sea
[42:05] his left foot on the earth and cried
[42:08] with a loud voice as when a lion Roth
[42:11] and when he had cried seven Thunders
[42:13] uttered their voices the Lord that his
[42:16] Blessing to the reading of the word you
[42:17] may be seated we continue talking about
[42:20] the seventh seal tonight and deal uh
[42:22] specifically with the seven Thunders
[42:25] that's the seven thunders of Revelation
[42:28] 10:3 when brother brandham preached the
[42:30] seventh
[42:31] seal he knew that the seven Thunders
[42:34] contained The Mystery of the seventh
[42:39] seal and so he he says that it was the
[42:42] end of all things we got that last week
[42:45] he said it was the uh seven Thunders he
[42:48] said it was the third pole and he said
[42:50] it was the coming of the Lord so those
[42:52] are the things that we know about what
[42:54] the seventh seal is and so we're moving
[42:57] through those tonight as the seven
[42:59] Thunders and maybe this is uh uh maybe
[43:02] to you might seem complicated but it's
[43:04] less complicated maybe than what you're
[43:06] thinking what people have made it
[43:09] because different ones over the years
[43:11] have said what the seven Thunders were
[43:14] but brother brandom actually tells us
[43:15] what they are and sometimes we just have
[43:18] to listen to what a prophet has to say
[43:21] and uh and just say what he said now uh
[43:24] he he he knew that that seven Thunders
[43:27] he said this one I have will speak and I
[43:29] spoke speaking of the seventh seal he
[43:31] said that it is the mystery of the seven
[43:33] Thunders the seven thunders in heaven
[43:35] will unfold this mystery so we've got
[43:37] that so far he said now what this great
[43:40] secret is that lays beneath the seal I
[43:41] do not know I don't know it I couldn't
[43:43] make it out I couldn't tell it just what
[43:45] it said but I know it was them seven
[43:46] Thunders uttering themselves right close
[43:49] together just banging seven different
[43:51] times and unfolded into something else
[43:54] that I seen that he said when I seen
[43:55] that I looked for the interpretation it
[43:57] flew across there I couldn't make it out
[43:59] he said the hour isn't quite yet for it
[44:02] this is in the seventh seal he said but
[44:04] it's moving into that cycle it's coming
[44:07] up close he said so the thing for you to
[44:10] do is remember that I speak to you in
[44:12] the name of the Lord be prepared for you
[44:15] don't know what time something can
[44:17] happen and then when something happened
[44:20] a lot of people missed it what had
[44:22] happened now it was the seventh Angel's
[44:25] job to to to preach to finish the
[44:27] mystery to reveal uh the seven thunders
[44:31] of revelation 10:3 we know that because
[44:33] he says in in verse four he tells John
[44:36] to seal it up he said don't write the
[44:38] things that the seven Thunders uttered
[44:40] but brandom said when it says the seven
[44:42] thund uttered he said there was
[44:43] something said he said it just wasn't a
[44:46] noise something was said he was about to
[44:49] write and and in the church age book
[44:51] brother Brandon presenting this as if to
[44:53] a an audience of people that didn't know
[44:55] anything about a a prophet or anything
[44:56] like that he says it this way he says
[44:58] what was in those Thunders no one
[45:01] knows but we need to know we need to
[45:04] know right so brother brother Ben why
[45:06] are you preaching this tonight because
[45:08] we need to know he said and it will take
[45:10] a prophet to get the Revelation because
[45:13] God has no other way of bringing out his
[45:15] scriptural Revelations except by a
[45:17] prophet now there's a a clue right there
[45:20] it has to be a prophet brother Adam's
[45:22] talking about here is a Vindicated
[45:24] Prophet not a person who prophet
[45:25] prophesized we went through that a while
[45:27] back but a Vindicated scriptural prophet
[45:30] in the end time he said the word always
[45:32] came by a prophet and always will so in
[45:36] verse 5 the angel which I saw stand upon
[45:38] the sea upon the Earth lifted up his
[45:40] hand to heaven we got this last week
[45:42] verse six he swear by him that liveth
[45:44] forever and ever who created heaven the
[45:46] things that there in are and and the
[45:47] earth and the Sea and the things which
[45:49] are therein there should be time no
[45:51] longer or no more delay he said but in
[45:53] the days of the voice of the seventh Ang
[45:55] Angel when he shall begin to sound yes
[45:59] right you see the continuation of it you
[46:01] got to read it together a lot of times
[46:03] we read Revelation 10:7 by itself but
[46:05] brother brandham reads Revelation 10 1-7
[46:08] he always he always does it that way
[46:10] Revelation 10 1-7 in the days of the
[46:13] voice of the seventh angel when he
[46:14] should begin to sound the mystery of God
[46:16] should be finished as he has declared to
[46:17] his servants of prophets I want to put
[46:19] this in a simple terms as as I can
[46:21] tonight so we can understand it not
[46:23] because you're simple people I believe
[46:25] you're a people that understand but even
[46:27] our little ones need to understand there
[46:29] were some things in the Bible that we
[46:31] didn't know there were some Mysteries
[46:34] that were not unfolded they were not
[46:36] revealed to us we didn't know what the
[46:38] correct interpretation of it was we
[46:40] didn't know exactly what God was going
[46:42] to do we didn't know exactly what the
[46:44] whole mystery of redemption was we
[46:46] didn't know the secret in the back part
[46:48] of his mind so there were some things
[46:51] that we did not know and so God would
[46:53] send a prophet at the end of Gentile
[46:56] dispensation to reveal those things
[47:00] that's what the seventh angel was to do
[47:02] you say well that's not controversial
[47:04] but that's what the seven Thunders are
[47:06] it's just God revealing what was unknown
[47:09] becoming
[47:10] known what was what John couldn't write
[47:14] now being
[47:16] spoken right so it's not some mysterious
[47:19] Deep thing it's just God doing what he
[47:21] said he would do God keeping his word
[47:23] and this gives me Courage by Logan that
[47:26] God keeps his word in this way he'll
[47:28] keep his word to me he'll forgive me
[47:30] he'll love me he he'll he'll take care
[47:33] of me he'll heal me why because he
[47:35] promised he would do it that's right
[47:38] when he when the seventh angel sounded
[47:41] he the mystery of God would be finished
[47:43] and we've seen God do that in our day
[47:46] and if we've seen him do that he'll keep
[47:48] every word of the
[47:50] Bible If he if you fulfill Revelation
[47:52] 10:7 he'll fulfill Hebrews uh 13 at
[47:56] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[47:58] and forever
[48:00] sir so the mystery of God being finished
[48:04] is the revelation of the seven Thunders
[48:07] which is a part of the breaking of the
[48:08] seventh seal so once again if the
[48:11] seventh seal is not open we don't know
[48:13] the voice of the Thunders the mystery of
[48:15] God is not
[48:17] finished and it's really easy to put
[48:19] those things in the future and say well
[48:22] one day uh people will know because then
[48:25] we're not accountable to those things
[48:27] but I think tonight we need to make
[48:28] ourselves accountable to the fact that
[48:31] the word the fullness of the word has
[48:32] comeing our day and what that does to us
[48:35] is it makes us uh have to face up to it
[48:37] and say I can live that there's no more
[48:40] excuses there's no more looking back at
[48:42] another age and saying or looking
[48:43] forward at something else and saying
[48:45] well if I had what they had or if I had
[48:47] what they will have but no we have it
[48:49] today we can live it today we can become
[48:51] it today we can become the word in flesh
[48:54] manifested word of God for our
[48:57] day we can be that as brother Keith
[49:00] spoke so eloquently Sunday night we can
[49:02] be the word as he read what brother
[49:04] brandham said he said you become the
[49:07] Revelation you become the manifestation
[49:09] of everything God said amen I love that
[49:14] so now a
[49:16] thunder is simply a voice of God that's
[49:20] not
[49:21] understood right a thunder now you find
[49:25] in 2 Samuel 22:14 other places in
[49:28] scripture as well just to give a couple
[49:30] here 2 Samuel 22:14 the Lord thundered
[49:33] From Heaven the most high uttered his
[49:35] voice it's a voice of God Psalm 18:13
[49:39] the Lord also thundered in the heavens
[49:41] and the highest gave his voice
[49:43] hailstones and coals of fire in John
[49:47] 12:28 uh God spoke from heaven and and
[49:50] Jesus first spoke he said father glorify
[49:53] thy name and then came there a voice
[49:56] from Heaven saying I have both glorified
[49:58] it and will glorify it again and the
[50:01] people that stood by heard it and said
[50:04] that it
[50:05] thundered right why they didn't
[50:07] understand what was said but Jesus
[50:10] didn't say it thundered because Jesus
[50:13] understood what was said other said an
[50:17] angel spake to him BR said remember a
[50:19] loud clapping noise of a thunder is a
[50:22] voice of God he said that's what the
[50:24] Bible says a clap of thunder they
[50:25] thought it was Thunder but it was God he
[50:27] understood it it was revealed to him it
[50:29] was a thunder so we find and I'm trying
[50:33] to move through this quickly tonight to
[50:35] keep your interest I know I know there's
[50:37] people are not interested at all in
[50:38] these things and and but I believe that
[50:40] you are I believe that's why you came
[50:42] out on a Wednesday night and and and I
[50:44] know that I know that the bride will be
[50:47] interested in these things some
[50:48] sometimes our our flesh gets dull and
[50:51] and weary and we get in caught up in lay
[50:53] with a sea we need to we need to strive
[50:55] for something higher and to understand
[50:57] something more and to be a part of
[50:59] something bigger than just our everyday
[51:02] uh everyday life and our everyday
[51:04] existence so there was a thunder at the
[51:06] opening of the first
[51:08] seal we know Revelation 61 I saw when
[51:11] the lamb open one of the seals and I
[51:13] heard as it were the noise of Thunder
[51:15] one of the four beasts saying come and
[51:17] see and now brother BR said notice the
[51:20] first seal opened the first seal when it
[51:21] opened in symbol form it thundered he
[51:24] said now what about when it's opened in
[51:25] its reality form yes he said it
[51:28] thundered as soon as the lamb struck
[51:29] back to seal what did it reveal he said
[51:32] I love this he said not all of
[51:35] itself so when it thundered what
[51:38] happened it revealed he said the lamb
[51:40] broke the seal when did that happen when
[51:43] did the lamb take the book when did he
[51:44] break the seal I might shock you but
[51:46] that had already taken
[51:48] place right it had already taken place
[51:52] but it was only revealed in symbol form
[51:54] you say when did that happen with the
[51:55] the Bible was written many many years
[51:57] ago and it contained that that the lamb
[52:01] took the book and opened the seals but
[52:03] when he opened the seals he never
[52:04] revealed all of it what did he do he
[52:07] revealed he said it didn't reveal all of
[52:09] itself for because that was left to the
[52:11] seventh angel messenger he said first
[52:13] it's with God next it's an ass symol
[52:17] then it's
[52:18] revealed first it's with God then it's
[52:21] in a symbol and then it's revealed three
[52:23] things he said it's coming forth from
[52:26] the throne I'm so glad this message
[52:29] didn't come from Jeffersonville it
[52:31] didn't come from Tucson but it came from
[52:33] the
[52:34] throne Amen brother brandham is uh now
[52:39] he he was about to explain in the
[52:40] seventh seal what what it was what the
[52:44] Thunder what what the seventh seal was
[52:46] in it fullness or as far as he
[52:47] understood it but even what he
[52:50] understood the angel told him he said
[52:51] don't go any further you remember we
[52:53] read it said stop go no further he had
[52:55] it written written on his notes then he
[52:56] goes a little bit further than he wants
[52:58] to go and he goes back and cuts off the
[52:59] end of the tape right and and does it
[53:02] cuz he's so serious about stopping right
[53:05] there now and and because there were
[53:08] some things that had to be just had to
[53:11] happen it couldn't be brother bandam
[53:13] couldn't come out and say it and if
[53:14] you'll read that brother Bram says that
[53:16] he said if I say it the devil run the
[53:18] wheels off of his car to stop it so
[53:20] there were some things that had to
[53:21] happen and then he could look back and
[53:23] say it was done
[53:25] right it couldn't be him promoting and
[53:27] say this is what's going to happen it
[53:29] had to happen and then he had to look
[53:31] back and say that's what happened are
[53:33] you with me so far so we we know some
[53:36] things about the Thunders we know that
[53:39] the Seven Seals are revealed at the time
[53:40] of the seven Thunders so when the seven
[53:43] Thunders are revealed the Seven Seals
[53:44] are revealed and vice versa we know that
[53:47] he says that in the breach he said the
[53:49] seven seal book is revealed at the time
[53:51] of the seven thunders of Revelation 10
[53:53] we also know that the seven Thunders
[53:56] will bring the bride together for
[53:57] rapturing
[53:59] Faith the seven Thunders will bring the
[54:01] bride together for rapturing Faith he
[54:04] says I believe that through those seven
[54:06] Thunders will be revealed in the last
[54:07] days in order to get the bride together
[54:09] for rapturing Faith you say well it's
[54:11] going to be a meeting it's going to be a
[54:13] certain preacher it's going to be a
[54:15] great emotional Revival and I'm for all
[54:18] of those things by the way but that's
[54:20] not what brings the bride together for
[54:21] rapturing Fai what brings the bride
[54:24] together for rapturing faith is this
[54:26] message it was the revelation of those
[54:29] seven Thunders those Mysteries revealed
[54:31] that's what we that's what we feed on
[54:33] that's what we gather
[54:36] around so the Thunders are for the
[54:40] bride the Thunders are for us to bring
[54:44] us together for rapturing Faith together
[54:46] with what together with the word which
[54:48] brings us together with one another
[54:50] because we're one with the word our
[54:51] Unity is not so much with one another as
[54:54] it is with the word and because we are
[54:56] united with the word we're United with
[54:57] one another now the Thunders are for us
[55:01] in John 12:3 when Jesus when that voice
[55:05] thundered Jesus said this voice came not
[55:07] because of me but for your sakes the
[55:10] Thunders are for us sir brother Brandon
[55:13] says this he says they are Mysteries
[55:15] again he says we don't know what they
[55:16] are yet but my opinion they'll be
[55:19] revealed right away this is in the first
[55:20] seal he said and when it does it'll give
[55:23] faith for that rapturing Grace for that
[55:27] church to move out oh I I believe we
[55:30] have it
[55:31] today you said brother Ben you believe
[55:33] we have rapturing faith I absolutely
[55:35] believe we have rapturing faith I I
[55:37] believe the same faith in this hour that
[55:39] causes you to believe the message is the
[55:41] same Faith to give you faith for a
[55:43] Rapture the same Faith that's kept you
[55:45] all of these years the same Faith amen
[55:48] that makes you go forward and move
[55:50] forward even though you've failed so
[55:52] many times yet you're here that same
[55:54] faith will take going to Rapture one
[55:57] day amen so brother BR says it'll give
[56:01] rapturing faith for the rapturing Grace
[56:03] I love that that church to move out he
[56:06] was talking about the Jews being blinded
[56:08] he said no more we could understand
[56:09] these things until the time comes for it
[56:12] to be understood right brother Keith
[56:14] talked about that on Sunday night there
[56:16] had to become a time for it to be
[56:17] understood he said oh my seven thunders
[56:20] of Revelation may he show the bride how
[56:23] to prepare for the great translation
[56:26] Faith oh my that's what we have in this
[56:28] hour that's what we've been a partaker
[56:30] of that's what we've been feeding on all
[56:32] of these
[56:34] years so we also know the seven Thunders
[56:37] must be
[56:38] scriptural the seven Thunders must be
[56:40] scriptural it cannot be something
[56:42] outside the Bible brother brandom tells
[56:45] us that because at first he said well
[56:47] it's on the back side of the book it's
[56:48] not even written then he comes around
[56:50] and begins to tell us he said when
[56:52] anybody thinks that he has those seven
[56:53] Thunders if it don't compare with with
[56:55] the rest of the word there's something
[56:56] wrong it's got to come thus sayith the
[56:59] Lord for this is the book this is the
[57:02] revelation of Jesus Christ in its
[57:05] entirety there so many false doctrines
[57:07] but Joel and I were talking about the
[57:08] other night so much false Doctrine comes
[57:10] from the fact people are trying to
[57:12] dovetail things together make things
[57:14] work when it don't fit with scripture
[57:17] and they're not making this the only
[57:18] scripture that we
[57:20] have and then the message being uh you
[57:23] say it's the message the word of God
[57:24] absolutely it's it's God's it's God's
[57:28] word which which is exactly what he said
[57:31] here it has to be the same right it's
[57:33] got to have be it's got to be the light
[57:35] shed on the word that's already been
[57:37] spoken it's got to be that it can't be
[57:39] something different because if it wrote
[57:41] another Bible it would be against the
[57:43] word
[57:44] itself and brother Bram says that
[57:46] everyone has always come to me said
[57:47] brother Bram them seven Thunders the
[57:48] voice thundered and he said write it not
[57:51] but close it up so that'll be seven
[57:52] Thunders will be revealed in the last
[57:53] days seven Thunders that'll tell us he
[57:56] said no don't that sound real good but
[57:58] watch what you're talking about when you
[57:59] say that he said see that you R it not
[58:02] see these seven Thunders utter their
[58:03] voices see he said don't write that but
[58:05] it's to be sealed up in the book until
[58:08] the last days he said now someone has
[58:11] many has been saying to me in
[58:12] theologians said brother Brandon with
[58:13] the Lord God said with your experience
[58:15] that the Lord has given you for his
[58:16] people he said you'd be eligible to
[58:18] write a Bible yourself your word if God
[58:20] has manifested I said that might be true
[58:23] brother Brandon was a major prophet just
[58:25] like Paul and Moses right but it wasn't
[58:28] time for the Bible to be written it was
[58:29] time for the Bible for the mystery to be
[58:32] finished right brother BR was doing a
[58:34] different thing than what Paul did a
[58:35] different thing than what Moses did he
[58:38] was finishing the mystery he wasn't wri
[58:39] in the
[58:41] scripture he said it might be true see
[58:43] he was trying to catch me I said but you
[58:44] see I couldn't do that he said why
[58:46] couldn't you you have all the
[58:47] qualifications I said but you look one
[58:48] word cannot be added or taken away one
[58:51] word I I read a great story in history
[58:54] the other day but the gay there's a
[58:55] there's a Bible called The Wicked Bible
[58:58] and it was the next the printing after
[59:00] the 1611 version of the King James
[59:03] version there was another printing of of
[59:05] the King James version the the uh
[59:07] frankly the publisher made so much money
[59:09] he decided he was going to print it
[59:11] again and when he went to print it again
[59:13] they they missed a word and it was it
[59:15] was in The Ten Commandments where it
[59:17] says Thou shalt not commit adultery they
[59:19] forgot to put the word
[59:21] not and the and in the wicked Bible it
[59:24] says Thou shalt commit
[59:26] adultery and and see changing one word
[59:29] makes a difference doesn't
[59:32] it the man ended up in debtor's prison
[59:35] died in debtor's prison because they
[59:37] finded him so much for for missing that
[59:40] and he was the royal printer in England
[59:42] but it was an important thing right
[59:45] that's an important thing that's kind of
[59:46] a big deal but we're taught that every
[59:49] word of scripture is like that not just
[59:52] that but every word of it every he said
[59:54] not a jot or turt will will pass away
[59:57] not not one thing can be changed aren't
[59:59] you glad we have a a a Bible That's
[1:00:01] accurate tonight and a word we can rely
[1:00:04] on so he said not one word can can be
[1:00:06] added or taken away he said well then
[1:00:09] them seven Thunders you see with them
[1:00:10] seven Thunders blasting out won't that
[1:00:12] be a revelation be given to some man I
[1:00:14] said no sir it be added something to it
[1:00:15] or taken something from it he said it's
[1:00:17] all revealed in there and the Seven
[1:00:19] Seals opened up the revelation of what
[1:00:22] that was Sir right
[1:00:25] that's what it was see it's still in the
[1:00:26] word you see you can't get out of that
[1:00:28] word it won't leave the word God's
[1:00:30] spirit will never leave that word it
[1:00:32] will stay right with the word blinding
[1:00:33] some and opening the eyes of others
[1:00:35] it'll always do that oh I want to be one
[1:00:37] who has my eyes open I want to have my
[1:00:39] eyes open so I can see where I'm walking
[1:00:42] what I'm
[1:00:43] doing amen now the Thunders were
[1:00:48] revealed under the opening of the
[1:00:51] seals they were revealed these are
[1:00:53] things we know about the Thunders cuz
[1:00:54] things about the brandom said they
[1:00:55] revealed under the opening of the seals
[1:00:57] the brandom said something happened the
[1:00:59] other
[1:01:00] day something happened the other day and
[1:01:03] he he refers to the tape he said you
[1:01:05] read or heard the tape the seven
[1:01:07] Thunders the seven Thunders brother
[1:01:08] Brandon refers to the tape is it is it
[1:01:11] this the sign of the end sir what time
[1:01:12] is it
[1:01:13] sir as his seven Thunders tape because
[1:01:16] it's the only time he ever took
[1:01:17] Revelation 10 as his text and preach
[1:01:20] from it he said see he said it happened
[1:01:23] the other day
[1:01:25] that's pretty clear isn't it he said you
[1:01:28] heard the
[1:01:29] tape it happened the other day what
[1:01:31] happened what was prophesied in his
[1:01:34] seven Thunder tape well go back and
[1:01:36] listen to that what time is it sir if
[1:01:38] you go back and listen to it brother BR
[1:01:39] saying that's so seven Thunders that's
[1:01:41] at the end is this something that's
[1:01:42] going to give the bride rapturing faith
[1:01:44] and it's exactly what it was so the
[1:01:47] thing he said would happen happened even
[1:01:49] though when he preached what time is it
[1:01:51] sir he doesn't even he he he doesn't
[1:01:53] even know for sure if that's what's
[1:01:54] going going to happen but he preaches it
[1:01:55] under inspiration and he said it
[1:01:57] happened the other
[1:01:58] day he said you know these things he
[1:02:01] said the time is at hand Church the time
[1:02:03] is at hand he said don't don't wait any
[1:02:06] longer he said how do you know the
[1:02:08] Rapture is not going on all the
[1:02:10] time there's a thought-provoking quote
[1:02:12] so just at this moment how do you know
[1:02:14] the Rapture hasn't
[1:02:15] started right going on right now in one
[1:02:19] sense it is cu the message is the shout
[1:02:22] right but how you know the Rapture is
[1:02:24] not going on all the time people started
[1:02:26] seeing their loved
[1:02:27] ones right he said first thing you know
[1:02:30] it'll be past one disappearing here and
[1:02:31] there it'll be gone the first thing you
[1:02:33] know he said and judgment will strike
[1:02:35] the world you say well I thought this he
[1:02:39] said it's too late now you realize what
[1:02:42] time we're living in no more delay no
[1:02:45] more things to happen before no more
[1:02:47] dominoes to
[1:02:49] fall if you ever did that you ever set
[1:02:51] dominoes up and and and when you you get
[1:02:54] them all in a long chain and you tip the
[1:02:56] first one and it kind of goes around the
[1:02:58] circle and goes around and around and
[1:02:59] finally the last one Falls that's where
[1:03:02] we're at the last one's already falling
[1:03:05] no more dominoes to fall we're here this
[1:03:08] is it right you say well how long's it
[1:03:11] going to be I don't know but this is it
[1:03:13] it might be it's already been 60 years I
[1:03:15] don't know how long it'll be but I know
[1:03:17] this I know when it happened it'll
[1:03:19] happen when Jesus prophesied capernium
[1:03:22] would go into the ocean it was two or
[1:03:24] three 100 years before that happened but
[1:03:27] it happened and there's come a prophet
[1:03:29] in our day said Los Angeles going to the
[1:03:30] ocean it's going to happen we don't know
[1:03:33] when brother BR told us he said you
[1:03:35] don't know and we don't know he said
[1:03:37] when it'll happen but it will happen at
[1:03:39] some point it will happen how do you how
[1:03:41] how can you say that because he's
[1:03:43] already done everything else except the
[1:03:47] coming of the Lord except the actual the
[1:03:48] literal body change if we could say it
[1:03:50] that way he's everything else is already
[1:03:53] over
[1:03:54] he said well what does that make us what
[1:03:56] makes us the most privileged people on
[1:03:57] ever to live on planet Earth to know the
[1:04:00] things that we know and see the things
[1:04:02] that we see though we Face trials and
[1:04:05] troubles I'll say this we should never
[1:04:07] get to
[1:04:09] down we should never get too caught up
[1:04:11] in what the world's doing what we even
[1:04:13] do this one Falls this one Falls that
[1:04:16] one messes up I'm not going to get too
[1:04:18] down cuz I know my redeemer lives and I
[1:04:21] know in a little while I'm going to see
[1:04:23] him face to face I know where I'm living
[1:04:26] I'm not just looking at something that
[1:04:27] might continue on and continue on
[1:04:29] continue on I'm looking at the end right
[1:04:32] so I know it won't be long
[1:04:34] now brother brand said he said we don't
[1:04:37] know he said now the coming of the Lord
[1:04:40] is in mystery we don't know when he's
[1:04:41] coming how he's coming but we know he's
[1:04:43] coming he said and so was all the
[1:04:45] mysteries of God waiting for this last
[1:04:47] day he said after it's already been
[1:04:49] completed then he reveals and shows what
[1:04:52] he's done now it's just as plain as the
[1:04:55] nose on your face I think after it's
[1:04:57] already been completed he reveals and
[1:05:00] shows what he's done Oh my he said he
[1:05:02] never gave his mystery in full remember
[1:05:05] he said he give it he it come first it
[1:05:07] was in God's hands then it come in
[1:05:09] symbol form he said and then it was
[1:05:11] known right he said it's just like this
[1:05:14] comparing the Seven Seals he said when
[1:05:15] God used Martin Luther for the coming
[1:05:17] out for that first church or that church
[1:05:19] age and when he used John Wesley
[1:05:21] gradually brought them out was revealing
[1:05:22] in them that church age he said
[1:05:24] revealing in them that church age he
[1:05:26] said when it goes back through the Bible
[1:05:28] now and find out but in the last days
[1:05:29] the reason that was such a tremendous
[1:05:31] thing that he spoke of it here he showed
[1:05:33] those seven Thunders he said Life
[1:05:35] Magazine packed that Circle of cloud and
[1:05:36] a light there they could not understand
[1:05:38] and don't know it yet he said but here
[1:05:40] telling go there and wait for those
[1:05:42] Mysteries to be be revealed and here
[1:05:44] months before it happened and then it
[1:05:46] happened exactly the way he said it
[1:05:47] would do he said even in the picture of
[1:05:49] the angel on the right when he was being
[1:05:51] materialized coming down with his wings
[1:05:53] back and his head setting sideways he
[1:05:55] said there it is right there in the
[1:05:56] picture just exactly months before it
[1:05:58] happened he said told here that he's
[1:06:00] going to bring the body of Believers
[1:06:01] together to reveal to take up them lost
[1:06:04] ends remember what was the seven
[1:06:06] Thunders to do to gather the bride to
[1:06:09] give them rapturing Faith the brand said
[1:06:11] we were told that they was going to
[1:06:12] bring the body of Believers together to
[1:06:14] reveal take up them lost ends he talks
[1:06:16] about Luther and Wesley and all of that
[1:06:18] he said and then comes the revelation of
[1:06:19] the mystery to reveal what it's all been
[1:06:22] about he
[1:06:24] what is this this this is Christ the
[1:06:27] mystery that's what brother br's
[1:06:28] preaching here now Christ the mystery
[1:06:31] and brother Kei said that Sunday night
[1:06:33] and I've said it to you before Christ of
[1:06:35] mysteries brother brandom's he's
[1:06:37] preaching the second part of the seventh
[1:06:38] seal just go and listen to it he reveals
[1:06:42] part of it he waits for it to come to
[1:06:44] pass and then he shows us what
[1:06:47] happened right now look now he talks
[1:06:51] about about Lutheran Wesley and how they
[1:06:53] still Trinity baptism and such he said
[1:06:56] then come back in the last days pick up
[1:06:57] all those Mysteries and clearly explain
[1:07:00] it reveal it he said why it's all the
[1:07:02] last days when this great mystery God
[1:07:03] had in his heart is being revealed he
[1:07:06] said do you get it and remember this is
[1:07:09] Christ The Mystery of God revealed he
[1:07:10] said if you fail come back to this tape
[1:07:12] again he said I don't know how much
[1:07:14] longer I'll be with you you talking
[1:07:16] about a prophet why would he say that at
[1:07:18] 50 55 56 years old 54 years old I think
[1:07:21] at the time he said I don't know how
[1:07:23] much longer I'll be with you remember
[1:07:25] this is the truth thus sayith the lord
[1:07:27] it's the truth it's the scripture he
[1:07:29] said like the seven Mysteries of the
[1:07:30] seven last seals the mysteries of them
[1:07:32] the seals had done been broken every age
[1:07:34] had come down and there they had left a
[1:07:36] lot of scattering and God not willing
[1:07:38] that it should be scattered I'm so glad
[1:07:40] he comes back and picks up those things
[1:07:42] those doctrines they started Luther and
[1:07:45] Wesley and all the other reformers were
[1:07:47] uted on out and revealed the whole thing
[1:07:50] he said same thing he's doing now in
[1:07:53] revealing the mystery of Christ how he
[1:07:56] was God's three-fold purpose for the
[1:07:58] church he said oh my letting him out
[1:08:01] reveal so what is the message of the
[1:08:03] hour what is the seven Thunders what is
[1:08:05] the seventh seal it's Christ he's
[1:08:08] revealing to us Christ he's letting him
[1:08:11] out amen he said reveal Webster says is
[1:08:14] to make known make known especially
[1:08:16] Webster says in Divine truth that
[1:08:18] Revelation means he said the Revelation
[1:08:20] is Christ's way listen I got to say this
[1:08:25] so you'll understand it's Christ's way
[1:08:27] of making himself known to his
[1:08:30] church every time we reveal something to
[1:08:32] his church it's Christ's way of making
[1:08:34] himself known to his church so what was
[1:08:35] he going to do at the end time make
[1:08:37] himself completely known to his
[1:08:41] church now now how how's that
[1:08:43] helpful now how's that helpful in our
[1:08:45] day let's just put it where these little
[1:08:48] girls on the front these boys on the
[1:08:49] front can understand it how is it
[1:08:51] helpful to know the Mysteries have been
[1:08:53] finished in our day how is it helpful to
[1:08:55] know who Christ is because if I need
[1:08:57] healing if I don't know that Christ Is A
[1:09:00] Healer or if I'm not sure that he's a
[1:09:03] Healer maybe he don't heal today that's
[1:09:06] what the many denominations say but if I
[1:09:09] need healing and I know Christ Is A
[1:09:11] Healer because he's revealed himself as
[1:09:13] that in this day then I can be sure I
[1:09:16] can have my healing right if I know he's
[1:09:19] a savior no matter what happens in my
[1:09:21] life and what you know how how low that
[1:09:24] Satan might I might get into a bad place
[1:09:27] but I know he's a savior I know he's a
[1:09:30] forgiver I know these attributes of God
[1:09:32] have been revealed to me in this day and
[1:09:34] it's not that we didn't know some of
[1:09:36] those things like we we knew it by head
[1:09:38] knowledge and and in the denominations
[1:09:40] they teach those things some of them
[1:09:42] teach part of it and some of them teach
[1:09:43] the rest of it but we teach all of it we
[1:09:46] believe he is a savior we believe he is
[1:09:48] a Healer we believe he is a peacegiver
[1:09:50] we believe he is a uh we believe he is a
[1:09:52] God who heals all of our disease we
[1:09:54] believe these things and so he's he
[1:09:57] shows all of it he shows the gifts he
[1:09:59] shows uh the ministry he shows our
[1:10:02] church and how it should operate he
[1:10:04] shows everything about himself and how
[1:10:07] he wants to operate here at the end time
[1:10:10] you understand now you we had to know
[1:10:11] these things because we're going to live
[1:10:13] in the worst time that there ever was
[1:10:15] and so he needed to reveal himself to us
[1:10:18] so we would be able to know what his
[1:10:20] character is so we'd be able to make it
[1:10:23] to overcome in the hour in the worst
[1:10:26] hour that's ever been yet there' be a
[1:10:27] bride that would overcome why because
[1:10:29] the Mysteries have been
[1:10:31] revealed say well the Mysteries don't
[1:10:33] matter the Thunders don't matter seals
[1:10:35] don't matter yes they do if you're not
[1:10:37] even sure God's A Healer unless it's
[1:10:40] been revealed to you that he
[1:10:42] is are you with me so
[1:10:45] far and a lot of this was God was
[1:10:48] setting his stamp on he was bringing in
[1:10:50] a in an authoritative manner so we could
[1:10:53] know this this is one that's what the
[1:10:54] scribes said when Jesus come they said
[1:10:56] this guy isn't like the scribes they
[1:10:58] said because he they always say well it
[1:11:00] could be this way it could be that way
[1:11:01] but he speaks with a voice of authority
[1:11:03] that's what the message is in this day
[1:11:05] is a voice of authority to speak to us
[1:11:07] the truth and we know that it is
[1:11:09] true are you with me so
[1:11:12] far amen what did Brother brandom say
[1:11:15] what brother brother Keith quoted it
[1:11:17] Christ in you is the center of the
[1:11:19] Revelation a powerful
[1:11:22] statement Christ in the center of the
[1:11:24] Bible he said makes makes makes the
[1:11:26] whole Bible the manifestation of Christ
[1:11:29] and Christ in you makes makes you the
[1:11:31] manifestation of the fullness of Christ
[1:11:34] that's
[1:11:35] powerful amen then brother sent me a
[1:11:38] quote today I didn't bring it with me
[1:11:40] but he he sent me a quote brother random
[1:11:41] said if you pray in Jesus name he said
[1:11:43] it's the same as Jesus
[1:11:45] pray Christ in you amen hallelujah oh
[1:11:49] that ought to give us confidence church
[1:11:51] that ought to give us confidence
[1:11:52] strength to be able to overcome anything
[1:11:54] that comes our way
[1:11:56] right now you say but why didn't they
[1:12:00] understand it when brother Brandon
[1:12:00] preached it well the disciples didn't
[1:12:02] understand I've read this to you before
[1:12:04] but that's what the Bible says these
[1:12:06] things understood not his disciples at
[1:12:08] the
[1:12:08] first but when Jesus was
[1:12:11] glorified when he became preeminent in
[1:12:14] the
[1:12:15] church amen when they received the Holy
[1:12:18] Ghost then remembered they that these
[1:12:20] things were written of him and that they
[1:12:22] had done these things unto him
[1:12:24] they didn't even know it when it
[1:12:25] happened they couldn't even see what was
[1:12:27] going on but later they looked at it by
[1:12:29] the Jo and said hey that's what happened
[1:12:32] that's what we've done in our
[1:12:34] hour now so brother brand says I've got
[1:12:37] 15 minutes left and we'll we'll close
[1:12:39] now he said he said he was asked the
[1:12:41] question directly have the seven
[1:12:43] Thunders which equal seven Mysteries
[1:12:44] already been revealed they revealed in
[1:12:46] the Seven Seals were yet not known to us
[1:12:48] as the Thunders yet he said no they were
[1:12:50] revealed in the Seven Seals that's what
[1:12:52] the Thunder thers was about it was to
[1:12:55] reveal the seven Thunders had Ed their
[1:12:57] voices no one could make out what it was
[1:12:59] he said John knew what it was but he was
[1:13:00] forbidden to write it but the seventh
[1:13:02] angel in the days of his sounding the
[1:13:04] seven Mysteries of the seven Thunders
[1:13:06] would be revealed and the seventh angel
[1:13:08] is a messenger of the seventh Church you
[1:13:09] see how how perfect it is it
[1:13:12] happened now I know brother brandom in
[1:13:15] in a couple of places people will throw
[1:13:16] this at you and if you ever find
[1:13:18] somebody that doesn't preach this that
[1:13:19] believes that the Thunders are something
[1:13:21] brother brandom is coming to preach one
[1:13:23] day there's a couple of quotes that
[1:13:24] they'll use and I want to read you those
[1:13:26] quotes and they're from 1965 and about
[1:13:29] August of 1965 brother brandom starts
[1:13:31] dealing with this in a message called
[1:13:33] the God of this evil age he said now in
[1:13:35] doing this he said I've come here for
[1:13:37] the purpose of teaching last vials the
[1:13:39] last seven vials the last seven Trumpets
[1:13:42] the last seven thunders of the Book of
[1:13:43] Revelation tying them together in this
[1:13:46] hour that we're now living to fulfill
[1:13:48] the opening of The Seven Seals the seven
[1:13:50] or to follow the opening of The Seven
[1:13:51] Seals seven Church ages he said so we
[1:13:54] couldn't get room to do it so I hope as
[1:13:55] soon as I can he Saidi hope as soon as I
[1:13:58] can we'll get a place sufficient either
[1:14:00] here or in Louisville New Albany or
[1:14:02] either put up a tent so we can just stay
[1:14:03] as long as the Lord leads us to do so
[1:14:05] many people took that and said Wella
[1:14:07] praise God brother br's going to come
[1:14:08] back put up a
[1:14:10] tent well if he does decide to come back
[1:14:12] we got some buildings we can get in I I
[1:14:15] don't know if we'll necessarily need a
[1:14:17] tent but AC brother said you don't mean
[1:14:21] to you know you don't want to some of
[1:14:22] the stuff they just don't it
[1:14:24] through and depending on what time of
[1:14:26] year and all of that as well but uh you
[1:14:30] know and and it would be it would be an
[1:14:31] interesting thing if he did we won't go
[1:14:33] into that tonight but you know he one
[1:14:36] one of the things he says he's come back
[1:14:37] to preach was the trumpets did you catch
[1:14:38] that he said the seven trumpets he
[1:14:40] already preached Feast of the trumpets
[1:14:42] he said the trumpets were to the
[1:14:44] Jews right the seven trumpets he's going
[1:14:46] to preach those why would he preach
[1:14:48] those now in another place he talks
[1:14:51] about the plagues and uh this this is in
[1:14:53] and no it not this is the next week
[1:14:55] August 15th of 1965 he said just wait
[1:14:59] till we get into opening them plagues
[1:15:00] and seals them seven Thunders watch what
[1:15:03] takes place now what he's already
[1:15:06] preached the
[1:15:07] seals he says wait till we get to
[1:15:09] opening the
[1:15:10] seals and the Thunders watch what takes
[1:15:13] place said oh brother you better get to
[1:15:14] Goan while there's time to get to Goan
[1:15:16] because they don't pay attention to this
[1:15:17] outside I say Amen to that he already
[1:15:20] preached the seals and I think what
[1:15:22] brother brandom is wanting to do is he
[1:15:24] want to take his time and and expound on
[1:15:27] these things he wants to talk about the
[1:15:28] seals and the vials and the trumpets and
[1:15:31] the
[1:15:31] Thunders God don't let him do
[1:15:35] it and in one place he actually says
[1:15:38] that he's already preached even the the
[1:15:40] vials and and and those things the
[1:15:42] plagues do you know
[1:15:45] that in Christ's revealed his own word
[1:15:47] which is the next
[1:15:49] week August 22nd 1965 he said said and
[1:15:53] last week's
[1:15:56] tapes I think will reveal to
[1:15:59] you the great hideous things that we're
[1:16:01] going to speak on one of these days when
[1:16:03] we can get a place
[1:16:05] sufficient that's pretty good isn't it I
[1:16:08] didn't know that till this week he did
[1:16:10] preach
[1:16:11] it last week's taste what is last week's
[1:16:14] tape he said the opening of the last
[1:16:15] plagues he said the vials rather pouring
[1:16:17] all the violence seven Thunders those
[1:16:19] hideous sights that come upon the Earth
[1:16:20] last week's stes he said we reveal to
[1:16:22] you the great hideous things last week's
[1:16:24] tapes now he's talking about he comes to
[1:16:26] preaches and knoweth it not and knowth
[1:16:28] it not was just after a service like a
[1:16:31] Sunday night he slips in what he's
[1:16:32] talking about is the week before God of
[1:16:34] this evil age and events made clear by
[1:16:37] prophecy go listen to those tapes and
[1:16:39] you'll begin to see the plagues and the
[1:16:41] vials and some of those things coming on
[1:16:43] the
[1:16:43] earth the part of it that we need to
[1:16:45] know
[1:16:46] anyway think about it for a minute
[1:16:49] church we we we wanted it to be all laid
[1:16:51] out for us but he doesn't deal with us
[1:16:53] that way he wasn't a theologian he was a
[1:16:56] prophet and so he wanted to lay it all
[1:16:59] out he wanted to take his time and
[1:17:00] preach the trail of the serpent but he
[1:17:01] preached the trail of the serpent to us
[1:17:04] we we get it through the through these
[1:17:05] sermons he preached the vials and the
[1:17:07] plagues and all these things through
[1:17:08] these sermons he showed us what they
[1:17:10] would be and if you go back you can find
[1:17:13] them last week's tapes he said so you
[1:17:15] say well somebody tell you well he's got
[1:17:17] to come preach those files what about
[1:17:19] last week's
[1:17:21] tapes right
[1:17:24] now he said well brother Ben if if the
[1:17:26] seven Thunders have been revealed what
[1:17:28] are they well brother brandom says they
[1:17:30] are the revelations contained in the
[1:17:32] Seven
[1:17:34] Seals I would say it this way the
[1:17:36] Thunders it's simply everything that we
[1:17:39] didn't know that we needed to know yes
[1:17:42] and now it's been
[1:17:44] revealed amen everything that we didn't
[1:17:48] know that we needed to know and now it's
[1:17:50] been revealed brother BR said it will be
[1:17:53] these divinely revealed mystery truths
[1:17:56] that literally turn the hearts of the
[1:17:57] children to the Pentecostal fathers so
[1:18:00] again if you if they've not been
[1:18:02] revealed then our hearts haven't been
[1:18:03] turned back but I'm so glad that we know
[1:18:05] they have been
[1:18:08] revealed what Revelations are containing
[1:18:10] in the seals everything we need to know
[1:18:12] everything that was unknown all the
[1:18:14] Loose Ends that needed to be tied up I
[1:18:17] want to go into something before we
[1:18:18] close I've got 9 minutes
[1:18:21] left a prophet's desire is not thus
[1:18:24] sayith the Lord how many knows that
[1:18:27] tonight brother Brandon wanted to come
[1:18:29] back and
[1:18:31] preach in a tent he wanted to come back
[1:18:35] to Jeffersonville and preach in a tent I
[1:18:37] don't think he ever contemplated coming
[1:18:39] back in flesh after dying but he wanted
[1:18:42] to come back and preach in a tent in
[1:18:45] Jeffersonville I have no problem with
[1:18:47] that I want I want I wanted brother
[1:18:49] bradam to come back if I had have been
[1:18:51] there I would have wanted him to come
[1:18:52] back back and preach again because a lot
[1:18:54] of things we didn't understand and the
[1:18:56] people didn't understand I I'll say this
[1:18:58] a again a prophet's desire is not thus
[1:19:01] sayith the Lord but the prophet has to
[1:19:02] surrender his will to the will of the
[1:19:06] Lord Jonah desired to go to
[1:19:09] tares if a prophet's desire is thus
[1:19:12] sayith the Lord I'm sure Jonah walked
[1:19:14] around telling people where he was going
[1:19:16] I'm going to tares no he
[1:19:21] wasn't I'm not I'm not the Brandon was
[1:19:23] Jonah but you understand what I'm saying
[1:19:25] he was a prophet a god- calleded major
[1:19:29] prophet who was going to go to tarish
[1:19:32] and flee from the presence of God but
[1:19:34] the Lord prepared a storm and a fish and
[1:19:37] brother BR said that's why God's
[1:19:39] prophets don't make no mistakes because
[1:19:41] it ended up being better than it would
[1:19:42] have been otherwise God don't let them
[1:19:46] right they they oh my when he says God's
[1:19:49] prophets make no mistakes he's not
[1:19:50] talking about the fact they wouldn't
[1:19:51] want to make a mistake
[1:19:53] he's saying God don't let him make a
[1:19:55] mistake like that cuz it's a major
[1:19:58] prophet I'm so glad that that many times
[1:20:00] there's been things in your life you a
[1:20:02] predestined child of God just like
[1:20:04] brother Brandon was a predestined
[1:20:05] ordained Prophet there's many times you
[1:20:07] wanted to do something and God kept you
[1:20:09] from doing that and you can look back
[1:20:11] and see I'm so glad I didn't marry that
[1:20:13] person I'm so glad I didn't go to that
[1:20:15] church I'm so glad I didn't take that
[1:20:17] route when I would have if I would have
[1:20:18] went that way I would have been caught
[1:20:20] up in a car accident don't you realize
[1:20:22] we to say not my will but thine be
[1:20:26] done Elijah wanted to
[1:20:31] die he asked God he said God just take
[1:20:33] me
[1:20:34] home it's my desire to die God said get
[1:20:38] up Elisha elah he fed him a little bit
[1:20:40] let the angel with soft hands come down
[1:20:42] comfort him and took him back in the
[1:20:44] cave and spoke to him in a still Small
[1:20:45] Voice said you got things left to
[1:20:48] do got more work for you to
[1:20:51] do
[1:20:53] you ever felt like that but even Jesus
[1:20:56] had said even Jesus said not my will sir
[1:21:01] but thine be done even the son of God's
[1:21:04] will desire was not thus sayith the
[1:21:07] Lord that's a that's a hard pill to
[1:21:10] swallow but it's true he had his own
[1:21:12] human desire he wanted to stay there
[1:21:14] with his disciples he wanted to live
[1:21:16] with them he wanted to spend time with
[1:21:18] them he wanted to he wanted to comfort
[1:21:20] them but he could not do it he had to
[1:21:21] fulfill the will of the
[1:21:23] father and God did exactly what he
[1:21:26] wanted to do with our prophet he
[1:21:28] preached exactly what he wanted him to
[1:21:30] preach then he called him
[1:21:34] home brother brandom said this he said
[1:21:36] you might have thought today I was
[1:21:38] trying to say this about myself this is
[1:21:40] in in Ed ones at end time he said being
[1:21:43] that I was packing this message I have
[1:21:44] no more to do with it than nothing no
[1:21:46] more than just a voice and my voice even
[1:21:50] against my better judgment
[1:21:54] I'm so glad we had a prophet who was
[1:21:56] willing to say not my will but thine be
[1:21:59] done he said I wanted to be a Trapper
[1:22:02] but it's the will of my father that I
[1:22:05] declared to do and determined to
[1:22:07] do I wasn't the one that appeared down
[1:22:09] the river I was only standing there when
[1:22:11] he appeared I'm not the one that
[1:22:12] performs these things and foretells
[1:22:14] these things that happens as perfect as
[1:22:16] they are he said I'm only one that's
[1:22:17] near when he does it it was only a voice
[1:22:20] that he used to say it it wasn't what I
[1:22:22] knew knew it's what I just surrendered
[1:22:24] myself to that he spoke through or that
[1:22:28] ought to be a that ought to be a sermon
[1:22:29] in itself to us preacher shouldn't it it
[1:22:32] wasn't what I knew it's what I
[1:22:33] surrendered myself to it isn't me it
[1:22:36] wasn't the seventh angel oh no it was
[1:22:38] the manifestation of the son of man it
[1:22:40] wasn't the angel his message it was the
[1:22:42] mystery that God
[1:22:44] unfolded it's not a man it's God so you
[1:22:47] see how the man could have wanted to
[1:22:49] come in intent and explain it all in
[1:22:51] detail and God wouldn't let at him
[1:22:53] because it was being held back for a
[1:22:54] special people that's us today so we
[1:22:58] would have
[1:22:59] it amen look he said it's not a man it's
[1:23:03] God the angel was not the son of man he
[1:23:05] was the messenger from the son of man
[1:23:07] the son of man is Christ musicians go
[1:23:08] ahead and come the son of man is Christ
[1:23:11] he is the one that you're feeding on
[1:23:13] you're not feeding on a man a man his
[1:23:15] words will fail but you're feeding on
[1:23:18] the unfailing aren't you glad for that
[1:23:20] tonight the unfailing body work word of
[1:23:23] the son of man I like to take that with
[1:23:27] where he says there will be a bride who
[1:23:29] will have thus sayith the Lord or will
[1:23:32] keep
[1:23:34] still think about the implications of
[1:23:37] that for a minute when even a prophet
[1:23:39] has his own desire yet he has to
[1:23:41] surrender himself to the will of the
[1:23:43] Lord there will be a bride who will have
[1:23:45] their own desire but they will be so
[1:23:47] surrendered to the will of the Lord he
[1:23:49] said they'll have thus sayith the Lord
[1:23:51] or they won't do anything
[1:23:54] they'll have thus sayith the Lord or
[1:23:56] they'll keep
[1:23:57] still How would how would a bride have
[1:23:59] that because thus sayith the Lord has
[1:24:01] been revealed in our
[1:24:03] day amen because a prophet surrendered
[1:24:07] himself to the word of the Lord so a
[1:24:08] bride can surrender thems to the word of
[1:24:11] the lord we can surrender ourselves to
[1:24:14] every portion of it even the parts we
[1:24:17] don't like or that's hard on the flesh
[1:24:19] we surrender ourselves to it because
[1:24:21] we're going home one day not my will but
[1:24:24] thine be done I want to ask you as you
[1:24:25] bow your heads they play something
[1:24:28] softly I'm asking myself this question
[1:24:31] too especially myself
[1:24:34] tonight I thought a lot about this as I
[1:24:36] was in I many times I want to do my own
[1:24:39] thing I I have my own
[1:24:41] will Lord help me to
[1:24:46] surrender I want to preach certain
[1:24:48] things I want to go certain places I
[1:24:50] want to I want to do this that or the
[1:24:53] other oh God let me do your
[1:24:58] will if even a prophet had to surrender
[1:25:01] his will to the will of
[1:25:03] God what about me tonight what about you
[1:25:07] are you feeding on the
[1:25:09] word have you been gathered so you can
[1:25:11] have rapturing faith have you
[1:25:13] surrendered yourself to the
[1:25:15] word we can say it this way if you had
[1:25:17] your

[1:25:21] that place you say Lord heart not my
[1:25:23] will but thine be done it's bright it's

[1:25:27] wonderful things that's the part of it
[1:25:29] is there's many times we can shout and R
[1:25:31] the aisles but tonight Lord help me to
[1:25:33] surrender
[1:25:34] myself help me Lord to surrender myself
[1:25:37] to your will even if people don't

[1:25:41] crazy even if everybody else says you
[1:25:43] should have done that you should have
[1:25:45] done this or that or the other oh God
[1:25:47] let me surrender myself to your will let
[1:25:50] me have my Gethsemane let me be the one
[1:25:53] who surrenders myself totally to the
