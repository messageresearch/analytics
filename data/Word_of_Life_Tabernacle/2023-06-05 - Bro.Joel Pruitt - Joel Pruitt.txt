just come Lord with a special anointing Lord and bless the hearers Lord move me out of the way so that I I could just be removed from the equation altogether Lord so that you could speak to these

not be hearers only Lord but help us to be doers also of the word today I pray you just continue Lord to be throughout this service we thank you Lord for showing up already and I pray you just continue to be with us now we pray in Jesus name amen you happy to be in the house of the Lord this afternoon and some of you are you happy to be here this in the house of the Lord amen I tell you what it's always an honor to be able to stand here before you I've got a real bad rebound up here brother Gabe I sound bad anyway so I need this to sound just as good as possible amen if you have your Bibles let's turn to John chapter 11. and we're going to read from verse 25 26. man do you love the Lord this afternoon amen John chapter 11 25 26 say man when you've got it and Jesus said unto her I am the resurrection and the life now this is Jesus going to the grave of Lazarus and he said I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live verse 26 and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die and he asked this question believe us thou this and in John 5 and verse 12 he that hath the son half-life and he that hath not the son of God hath not life you may be seated may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of the word [Music] I was reading that there and you know the Story of Lazarus is a very uh interesting story but I I believe there's a a message there within the message if if you will of The Story of Lazarus when Lazarus is is laying there it was a friend of Jesus and he's laying there in the Tomb and he had died and you know Jesus makes a statement I'm glad that I wasn't here to pray for him I'm glad for your sakes that he passed because Jesus knew who he was Jesus knew that the resurrection and the life was within him and I think today if if we could just take that story just for a second and look at it and realize that he was trying to show them who he was because he knew by the word who he was but now the word is going to speak and the life will come into a man who has been dead for four days and I think if we can look at that for just a moment and realize that when we speak if the word is within us and the word speaks through us then you who were once dead in your trespasses and sins can be made alive again can you say amen I think that is what the word has come to do is to Quicken our mortal bodies and I would like to take a subject today quick into Life by the word and I believe that's what happened at the grave of Lazarus that day I believe that it was quickened by the word speaking to him can you say Amen it wasn't an emotion I doubt Jesus went down there and had to dance and and to shout around the grave although that would be fine but what he did was he went down and he spoke the word to Lazarus and Lazarus came forth and I believe today if we can just speak the word the word has such a power in it and such an authority in it that those who are dead around us if we speak the word to him we can call them forth to life you can speak the word over your children you can speak the word over your family and just like Lazarus that was laying there dead you speak the word and watch them come back to life watch them come back home what is it it is you speaking the word of God it is Christ being revealed in you today can you say amen I believe that God today wants a people who are not afraid to speak the word of God and not afraid to take a hold of the promises of God today we're not afraid we're not ashamed of it but we can take the word and use it just like Jesus did why because we're not Jesus Christ but in US dwells The Same Spirit and the same spirit that Jesus had he said if that Spirit dwells in you it will Quicken your mortal bodies can you say Amen today now we can see that God was reflected first through Christ and then you can look down Through the Ages and brother Branham talks about well he was reflected through the prophets and then he was reflected in in Christ in such a manner that we could see the very attributes the very uh how would we say this the very uh character of God being expressed through Christ and and so brother Branham goes on and he talks about these these Reflections and how God was reflected down through the prophets and he says he says now let us look at some that has been quickened into this house of God of their age he said Enoch was the Living Word of God of his age he was a prophet he said a prophet is God's reflector how many knows that the reflector doesn't reflect itself it re the reflector is the reflection there has to be something to strike the reflector to make it reflect can I get some more monitor up here brother game there has to be something to strike the reflector to make it reflect so a prophet is a chosen vessel of God that cannot reflect nothing at all but he's in direct line with that reflection of God to reflect the image of Christ the word so remember it's not the prophet that is the reflection but he is only reflecting the word that is coming that day we are only reflecting Christ to the people of the day we are not Christ himself we are not the literal body ourselves but yet we make up a mini-membered body which is the reflection of Christ on the Earth today and he said so you think about you walk out in the parking lot and the sun is shining down on a white car and you look at that car and you see that sun it just about blinds you off of that car but the car is not the Sun but the sun is shining onto the car and the reflection is coming back to you what is it it is Christ himself reflecting to the believer and the believer reflecting the word of God to you I hope you can see it today when I saw this I realized something we're missing it we're trying to say well that man was God that man was Christ no they are reflecting the very word for their hour brother Branham was in Christ but he was reflecting Christ to us we are not Christ ourselves but we are reflecting Christ today there is listen we can look at it like this we can say well well you don't look like Christ no but if the spirit is in you and if his Spirit has shown upon you then the very Life Will Shine from you it'll be the same thing just the same reflection as looking at a car in the Sun and what is it it is a reflection of Christ he said see nothing else can do it you are a reflector that's the reason the prophet had to eat the book brother Ben and I were talking about this quote just in the back room he said that's the reason he had to eat the scroll he had to reflect that word for that age he said you got it he said notice Enoch God's perfect reflector and type when God was through with him he just translated him and took him up the mechanics that had that he had reflected and became Dynamics with the spirit and took him up he said the same in the Days of Elijah Elijah even to his bones were that reflection of God in his body being made manifest the word of God he said there laid a dead man on it and he sparked to life again what was it God had reflected into that body so long and so much that the reflection of God was still coming out of his bones I wonder sometimes if you find yourself sitting there in a dead and cold condition if you could just realize who you are and realize that God has shined his light in this day you can be the reflection of the word today you don't have to wait for a prophet to come back you don't have to wait for your favorite evangelist to come by but you are the reflection of Christ today can you say Amen we don't have to wait on nothing but the spirit of Christ is here we are the sons of God we have the spirit of Christ in us there's nothing more to take place but God has already sent his Spirit into the church if we can take a hold of it we can be the reflectors today just like Enoch and guess what at the end of our life just like Enoch we get to be translated too we get to walk out of here without even tasting death we don't even have to face death as a Believer a Believer can't die but you will be translated you will be taken out he said notice now he said then you are a son of God in the house of God you are a part of God's economy and he ties this into Romans 8 1. he said then there is no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus and brother Ben read that this morning for you walk not after the flesh but you're walking after the spirit that is on the inside of you you're not reflecting just the nature of a flesh man anymore but you are reflecting the very nature of Christ in you then he said they are dead to the world and alive in him and living in this present day making the word that God has used them or foreordained to them placing their name in this bright book aren't you thankful for that and when the waters comes upon that seed that's in the heart it raises it up to the bride of Christ he said oh my just perfect as it can be in every age it's been that way the Lutheran's under justification the feet that raised it like that Wesley under sanctification the Pentecostals under the arms the works and the deeds and so forth he said they had to be legalists but now we have come to the Head the Capstone what is it the fullness of the body of Christ is coming under one head and it is Grace Grace to you today Church you're no longer under the law you're no longer in sin and trespasses and bound down to the law but you have been set free by the spirit of God in your day can you say amen he said The Headstone crying Grace he said pass from death and Creed into a Living Word can somebody say Living Word into a living word today of the Living God he said that's God's only provided plan for his age I'll tell you what I like that that's the only provided plan that God has today is to have a Living Word and I'll say this in a living body called The Bride of Jesus Christ he said his sons in the word age excuse me God's only provided plan for his age his sons in the word age quickened by the spirit like a spark that's lit off of something to make it alive and seated now in Heavenly places and he says in present tense already alive and subject to every promise in the word of God and subject to every promise you are subject to every promise in the word of God he said then what does that do you being a part of God's Gene a part of the word other men a part of God's word seated together manifest the entire body of Christ because there's no leaven among you aren't you thankful for that he said you and other men remember it's not just what you see here that makes up the body but it is a a body of Christ that may be around the world is a universal body but we are making up the body of Christ on the Earth today and I hope you can see it Church you are more than just a flesh being you have now the spirit of Christ in you that is quickening you from the things that kept you down that kept you back in the denominational system things that held you down in the Baptist and the methodists and the Catholic and the Pentecostal but now you have been quickened not by an emotion not by a sensation but you have been quickened by the revealing of the word of God today because the prophet has come and revealed Christ to you and because you've seen that reflection you've seen the light on the prophet and now the very light is in you and you have become reflectors of Christ's word today oh I believe Christ is right here among us if we could just recognize it's not in just one man it's not in just a one group of people but it is a many-membered body of Christ today we are his heirs we are his attributes on the Earth today he said his sons were quickened he said then what does it do you being a part of God's Gene a part of the word other men a part of God's word seated together today manifest the entire body of Christ because there's no leaven among you you are the reflection of Christ on the Earth today can you say Amen you are living the word for this age you are making the word live by living by letting it live through you if the word has no body then where would it go if Jesus had no body he would have never been able to go to the grave of Lazarus and call him from the dead the voice of God must have a body to live in because God speaks through the body think about it it's not just on tape listen to me church it's not just on tape you can sit there and hear it and hear it and it'll never reflect anything but the fact that you've listened to tapes and that's good but listen the very bride of Christ will be saying the same thing that the prophet said why because he came with the voice of God in him Jesus did and the voice of God called Lazarus from the dead and that same power is in the bride today that same quickening power is not just in Jesus not just in Paul not just in brother Branham but it is in the many membered body called The Bride today you have the quickening power in you what called us the word called us it called us from the deadness that we were in whether it was denominations whether it was dead to sins whatever it was the word has called us and made us alive through the word the body of Christ the word is being manifested through the called out uh prophet of the day think about it the prophet came to call out a body that's his whole Ministry was to come and call out a bride out of a denominational system out of a church order out of something that looked like it was so well put together but in it you would find Creeds and dogmas and you would find that they would bring back and they would major on a gift or they would major on an emotion or they would major on a priest or a pope or something like that but in this day the prophet of God pointed us back and set your major on the word of God because that's the only thing that's going to make a living body of Christ today because you are living out the word today brother Branham talks about it when he talks about the no leaven among you he said just the word only I need a little more monitor brother Gabe I'm sorry I just can't hear myself and that's that's usually good no leaven among you just the word only brother Braham says sedan in Heavenly places in the door where he puts his name Christ Jesus no leaven among you that brings the entire fullness of the godhead bodily among you thank you it couldn't do it in Luther's age couldn't do it in Wesley's age couldn't do it in the Pentecostal age but in the day when the son of man will be manifested revealed and brought back to the church together with the entire deity of God among his people showing the same visible signs manifesting himself like he did at the beginning when he was manifested on Earth in the form of a prophet God he said Oh Glory promised by Malachi 4 promised by the rest of the scriptures where you worship at the house of God seated in present tense he says now we know the prophet could reflect Christ because he did it All Through the Ages and we know that that we could see Christ in his attributes and we could see Christ because he could call a person from the dead or he could go down to Sister Hattie Wright and he said he said you know you can speak what you will and it was him giving Authority what through a god-given message and a gift that God had given him but remember then it had to change to the prophecy because the prophet could stand there there and you would look at the prophet and you say well my eyes are looking to you and your ordained elitist but then the prophet had to turn around and say don't look to a man but look to the prophecy look to the word that has come look to this day and this hour it's no longer looking to a mortal man on this Earth but it's looking to have Vindicated for ordained Body of Christ on the earth that is living out the revelation of Jesus Christ we are more than just another church we are more than just another organization we better be we are more than just another denomination that is called to say we've got to sit around and do a certain thing at a certain time no we are called to be living men of God and women of God to live out the Life of Christ in our age The Works that were in Christ the flesh body that God created and lived in will still be living out in this body think about it that body that God created did all sorts of Works while he was on Earth he could go into the City and he could cast out demons and and it was the spirit of God that was on the flesh brother Branham said that flesh had to be a man and it had to die as a man but when God the spirit would Quicken that body then that was no more a man but it was God reflecting himself through human flesh and when you see it in that way you realize that the flesh had to die because he had to be tempted in all like manner he had to go into the grave he had to die a sinner brother Branham said so that he could be raised up as a God man and he could be set at the right hand of God and be there to atone for our sins brother Brandon would go on to talk about the living body of Christ and he would say when he went down to the Grave there of Lazarus he was nothing but a man he said he wept like a man he he talked like a man he missed his friend like a man you know what it was a man flesh body but when he pulled his shoulders back it was the quickening power through the man calling a dead man to life again and I would like to say to you today you have the same power today because that power that is within you you can walk up to your children that have backslid you can walk up and you can say child you may be gone you can tell them sister Karen you can say you may have went as far as you think you can go you may look like you're completely lost but I serve a living God who can bring those children back from the dead they can bring them back from the from their sin and trespasses they live in what is it we don't have to lose a one of them because the body of Christ is here and we can call the dead things back to life you say you're making us God the spirit that is within us is the power the spirit that is in US is the quickening power it's not this flesh I have no power you have no power but within you is a quickening power and it gives you the authority to speak that's what we have today we have the authority within us Saint John 14 12 through 14 verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall he do because I go unto my father and whatsoever you shall ask in my name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the son so you can see it there the father had to be glorified in the son because the works that he because he would speak in his name and if you go on down he says the same or the Greater Works will you do so what are those Greater Works they're here brother Branham would turn around and say the same Works was creating a you could take a loaf of bread and create more bread you could take a fish and create more fish because there was something there that Crea that could create but he would turn around and say the Greater Works was that third pull he could create squirrels where there was no squirrels he could create eyes where there was no eyes he could create where there was nothing there to create from what was it it was a spoken word of God it was a Greater Works living out in our day and they've been proved to us they've been proven to us Eddie Wright could speak brother Branham didn't have to speak for her but he could say you speak you asked and she could speak and the word of God would go forth from her mouth because the greater work she could do because why she had accepted the third pull message of a prophet messenger she had said that's nothing but the truth and when you can say to the message of the hour that's nothing but the truth then you take on that third pull Greater Works in you why because the Greater Works the word is now in you you say I don't brother brother Branham didn't have the Greater Works yes he did but listen to me it wasn't just for him it was him speaking the word that God gave to him and then the bride said yes that's nothing but the truth and then when you spoke that then the Greater Works could come from you not just the prophet if you had need of something to eat you could speak and it would be there if you had need of healing you could speak an arm on that wasn't there if you had need of it you could speak anything into existence brother Brandon said you could speak in a new world and go live on it what is it it is the the power of the Holy Ghost in the bride today it is the Greater Works promise from John 14 12. Church don't let somebody tell you that a prophet has to come back for the Greater Works don't let somebody tell you that the Greater Works have to be because you have to listen to the tapes to get the quickening power no the quickening power is in you and if the quickening powers in you it has a voice and he can speak it doesn't have to be a hush it don't have to be the preachers don't have to be told to shut up no the preachers are going to preach why because the quickening power is in the preacher but it is not just the preacher it is in you it is in every one of you what is it on the day of Pentecost it didn't just go into the disciples but it went into every one of them that came into the room to be filled with the Holy Ghost every one of them could receive the same power every one of them and so is it today men will limit it to a man men will say you can't receive it but a prophet could do it he's got to come back so that he can speak arms and legs on you he got to come back so that you can have the power of a Rapture that's nonsense the power for the Rapture is in you today when you hear false Doctrine like that what it is is they don't know who they are they've never come in contact with the word for their day they've never come in contact with a holy ghost that'll Quicken you from the things that you once did the Devils that once would bind you but remember then the midst of the battle that's when you have to stand up and say I don't care what you said I don't care what you believe I believe the word that was for my age and by the word I have the quickening power it was the word of God that's quickened us he said well I don't feel like worshiping today let the word get in your heart and you can't help but worship when they come down to the Red Sea all they had to do was listen to Moses and when they listened to him they were all going to go back well Pharaoh's Army was coming and they were all going to go back because they thought there was no way ahead but then the word of God spoke and created a path for them to go through on and they followed the word and then when they got to the other side I hope you hear me now when they got to the other side they could beat their tambourines and they could shout and they could dance why because they had followed the Vindicated Prophet for their day we're not following man's ideas we're not following a seminary or a theological idea of some brainwashed denominational chicken preachers but we're following the word of God for our day I hope you hear me today we don't have to be discouraged and beat down and kicked to the side for nobody because we are the living body today of Christ on the Earth somebody come tell you something different say get thee behind me Satan get out of my life you don't belong here because this message is a promise this message is not a message of negativity well if you don't turn that tape on at two o'clock on the dot then you may not be bride oh come on free well I'll tell you what I've come out of that nonsense I've left Egypt but I'm going to a promised land where all the promises lay the promises of God that said your children can come with you your household can come with you all you have to do is follow the message nobody else I don't have to follow some new Prophet or some new preacher but I can follow the message of the hour because you want to talk about perfection you want to talk about perfection you can find the mistakes all you want to you can point to a man's human errors if you want to but I'm here to tell you that God gave us the best he could give us when he gave us the message of the hour if he'd have had somebody better he'd have sent him if it had somebody I'm gonna just preach to you for a minute if he'd had somebody better in mind then you're telling me God's not good enough to send that one no God was big enough to give you the best thing he could give you he was big enough to send a prophet who may have not had nothing but a seventh grade education but the man had the quickening power to bring out a bride the man had something on the inside he wasn't so big that he had to go follow after denomination and take the biggest check and the biggest paycheck no but he followed the will of God and he showed you the way that you could live all you have to do is walk humbly he said live a Christian Life and just walk in the word of God Walk In The Light for your age and I'll tell you watch the miracles happen watch the signs of the believer come in your life it ain't no workup it ain't no shouting because you feel like the music's just right it ain't none of that nonsense I'll tell you what I shouldn't say nonsense that's okay but if the word I'll tell you what a prophet said he said if the word hasn't quickened you it could be because it was a dead seed now I don't want to believe that about any of you or myself so I'd like to tell you today if the word Goes Forth let the quickening power make it live through you if the word has struck the seed in your heart then I I challenge you to stand up and believe it in the name of Jesus I challenge you not to sit there and say well it was another good service it was just another good day at church and we had some good music and some good singing we had we had a we had a pretty bad preacher but everything else was pretty good but I'm going to tell you today if the word I don't care who speaks it I don't care if a donkey speaks it brother Ben if the word has struck your heart today if faith has struck the seed if there's life in you then watch that word live through your life oh I'll tell you Church it ought to make somebody excited enough to shout today it ought to make somebody get out of the deadness that they're sitting in brother Bradham said sometimes you're sitting there and you're dead it's 12 o'clock well I'll tell you if there's a seat on the inside then there's nothing Dead about this church if there's a seed on the inside nothing can stop the dance when they got to the other side nothing could stop marry him from shouting nothing could stop her from playing that tambourine nothing could stop her praise why because they had just defeated the biggest army that was chasing them Devils were after him they were riding chariots and you know what maybe these children of Israel would just walk in maybe they didn't have much according to the world maybe they didn't have the biggest denomination but I'll tell you what they had they had a prophet that was showing them the word for the age and they were following the prophet and you know what come before they followed the prophet they had to go in their homes and they sit there and they had to apply the token it wasn't just them following him out of the goodness of their hearts but the token had kept them from death oh I hope you hear me today some of you were sitting in a chicken pen oh yeah and a message came and said you must have the token you must have the Life of Christ in you and you didn't turn it down but you accepted it why because there was a predestinated seed on the inside and when the message come by and the light struck the seed it grew into a son or daughter of God what did it do it showed that Christ's word wouldn't go out void but it would return to him again listen Church you are not defeated you are not cast down you weren't caught at the Red Sea but you followed a prophet on through the waters and remember today Church you're not following a dead word you're not following a letter only but you're following a Vindicated for ordained message to a bride today and I don't want to hear oh it's a dead word I don't want to hear that this is the most alive thing on the message Earth today listen the Pentecostals that are shouting over the music and the speaking in tongues and all these things that's called dead because they're going back to something that was something that was dried up something from another age but to this age there is Prophet Messenger to this age there is a word that came forth to this age we have been called to more than just a good time but we can shout over the word we can shout because our names have been written in the Lamb's Book of Life Paul we are the bride of Christ that ought to make us happier than anything yes sir we don't have to yeah we don't have to be beat down say well the Pentecostals they shout at all service why can't we do that well I mean if we do that's wonderful but we don't have to to know that what we've got is the goods we can pick up the Bible right here and point you to everything we believe and it's true they can point you to Acts 2 38 but then when you get down on the tongues being the evidence they deny it this bride doesn't deny one word this bride will follow the prophet Messenger to the age and listen we don't follow him just because he's a man that that did gifts and signs and wonders we follow him because he showed us the word of God we follow him because he took us back to this and he did the same works but that didn't stop with him it wasn't limited to just him but it was for you also he said Jesus Christ the same yesterday he showed you what he did then he showed you what he's going to do today he said and today and then he said forever that was not just for the prophet that was not just for Christ but that was for you because Christ had to live through somebody can you say Amen Christ couldn't just think about it if there was no body of Christ then where is he was a spirit with nobody to go into but because we are here we have given him a place to dwell this is his house this is his body and if we ever look at ourselves like we are the temple we are the body of Christ and think about it because we can give we give him first place in our lives that way because we realize this is not my own I'm giving everything I've got to Jesus maybe you say well I'm not real gifted we'll give what you got to Jesus give what you've got to him let him come in and brother Brandon would talk about indoors to adore him he would say let him come into every room of your house don't just invite him into the one room but let him come in and fill every being let him come in and not just fill you with a head knowledge but let him come in and give you the baptism of the Holy Ghost so that you don't just have to speak in tongues no but what it does it is a resurrection power that Christ had at the grave of Lazarus that is still yours today brother Brandon would go home down here he said now the holy spirit is here on Earth looking out those individuals that God has ordained to life in this age and as soon as it finds it it does just like it did on Jesus Christ you see what I'm saying now you say well you're saying the word Jesus Christ no but the works and the same spirit is here Among Us I'm not here trying to make you God or me God or you bought you the literal Jesus Christ I'm not trying to do any of that what I'm trying to tell you is if the spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwells in you then it will Quicken your mortal body the great super Son of God who redeemed us all he said it comes down and takes its place of Abode into the human life he said now notice it brought the quickening power now that quickening power that come upon Jesus quickened him to manifest every promise of the word of that day now listen this is the application part he said so does the holy spirit that come upon us in this day if it's not a mockery Holy Spirit if it's not the devil mocking the Holy Spirit but is the real true Holy Spirit it'll manifest the promise of this hour when it fell upon Luther it manifested the promise of that hour when it fell upon Wesley it manifested the promise of that hour when it falls in this day it manifests the promise of this hour when it fell upon Moses it manifested the promise of that hour listen it fell upon Noah it manifested the promise of that hour when it fell Upon Jesus it manifests the promise of that hour he said it's the Holy Spirit coming down to Quicken make alive those people that's for ordained listen to this part it's four ordained of God to be in the rapture nobody else was gonna be quicker like this but you that are ordained foreordained for a Rapture must be quickened by the spirit he said you are four ordained he said fell upon uh and and he said this excuse me when it fell Upon Jesus it manifest the promise of that hour see it's the Holy Spirit coming down to Quicken and make alive those people that's for ordained of God to be in the Rapture he said notice if he is a true Eagle he will understand the message of the hour if he's a true Eagle now the little Eagle probably in the barnyard was eating all right but he knowed it wasn't just exactly right but when he heard the truth when he received this truth he's noticed the very message of the Gospel itself is to prove to the people that he has risen the very gospel the very good news that we're preaching here today is not to tell you about a Jesus that just died but we are here to tell you that the same woman that died his Spirit came back into the church to raise you up it didn't just come to show you that a man could die and could raise himself again what good would that do for us brother Brandon speaks about it in the rising of the sun he said what good would it do to point to A Jesus of 2000 years ago if we couldn't point to the fact that he's still living now [Applause] there's no reason to point to just a god of history but we're pointing to what he did to show you what he'll do we're showing you what his attributes were in Jesus we're showing you what his attributes were Brother Bear talked about an Enoch and in Elijah and so forth to show you the attributes that we have today he said notice the very message he said go tell my disciples I'm risen from the dead and I'll meet with them to confirm this to them he said oh God how in this last day there shall be light again across the Earth and he said I'll prove to my disciples go tell them I'm not dead I'm not a tradition but I'm a living Christ I'll meet them and he said take this message to my disciples that I'm risen from the dead I'd like to tell you today young men young preachers that we are ordained to take this message and go tell the world that he is not dead but this message is proving a resurrect to Jesus today we're not here to preach tradition we're not here to preach just to make people feel good but we're here to show you that the Living God of the Bible is still living today he's still alive he's still Among Us brother Branham goes on he he quotes Hebrews 13 8 again he said we his beneficiaries are to prove his life is in US now the beneficiaries of this life the life there never was a life life lived like it he was the son of God and he died and that shut it out but when he raised again from the dead on Easter morning then we as his servants are commissioned by him to go into all the world and to bring this good news to every person that he is a living and now we can do it by the he said how can we do it by word only my brother Brandon would actually take this and you'll hear in a couple places where he talks about word only and he talks about it in a good manner because the word produces all these things that's right I hope you understand that the word is what the gifts themselves are in the word so the word only is okay but you must have the power within you to even understand the word if you don't have the Holy Ghost in you and you're coming trying to reveal the message to me then I'm going to highly doubt that you know what you're talking about but if the Holy Ghost has come in you and then the message has crossed your path then the Holy Spirit Will Reveal to you the understanding of the message brother Brandon goes on he said the gospel came out by word only but through the power and the manifestation of the Holy Spirit to prove that he is alive now if there is another gospel as Paul as Paul spoke to one of the groups he said I am so surprised that you turn to another gospel which there is no other but a make-believe gospel to a denominational fiction turning from that good news he said and because I live you live also this is the good news he's talking about in John 14 12 we just read the works that I do will identify myself in you he is being identified reflecting through you by the same works that he did I hope you see it today I'm not going to keep you all day I'm about done he said the works that I do will identify myself in you what a message he said no wonder we've had a dark world of theology but in the evening time there shall come light again remember we've went through the Dark Ages and we've seen what the Dark Ages will produce it'll produce a Catholic Church it'll produce another Westland or a Lutheran but in the evening line it would produce a bride called the body of Jesus Christ I dare you to disbelieve it today I dare you to say that there's not a living body today because I can show you a word that has been revealed to us that lines up perfectly with the scriptures in the New Testament I can show you where the same thing Paul taught is the same thing we're teaching today I can show you by the messenger of light that we have when we know what we're talking about because the spirit has come in this day and revealed the truth to us I hope you're hearing me today the word has power to change lives the word has the power to raise you up because it did it once I hope you hear me and if Jesus at the grave of Lazarus was the word made flesh then the word made flesh today will do the very same thing that the word made flesh then did can you say Amen if the word was made flesh then and it did those works we can do the same today because we are the word made flesh today Amen brother Branham said I'm afraid today that too many of us are not getting people to Christ we're getting them to a church to a theory but we must get them to Christ what is Christ the word he said he is the only one and the only one that has life you want life back in the church let's get Christ back in the church you want Christ in your home let's kick out the television and put Christ back in the home you want Christ to rule over your life then quit letting something else rule over you quit that in the darkness and the powers of this evil age rule over you but let Christ rule your life you want a living body that's how to have one but Christ's back in the body [Music] he said he that has the son has life the Bible says that and if the life of a man that's dead be projected in you you will live the same life he lived if the blood of a man was a certain type and you took the blood from one man and changed the blood of the one man into another he would absolutely be that type to blood if your spirit that's in you is reckoned dead and you are anointed with the life that was in Christ is upon you and he goes on to say Romans 8 11 again he said if the spirit that raised up Christ from the dead dwells in you it also quickens your mortal body he said that same life them same Powers them same beneficiaries that he had here on Earth from God he redeemed you a seed that was foreknown by God whose names was put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world and that's some shout material right there because your name was there before there ever was a fall your name was there before there was ever a sin that you committed your name always has been on the Lamb's Book of Life and I'll tell you what if it's there it can't be taken off if your name was put there then no man can take it off no Prophet can take it off nobody can take it off because it was there before there ever was an earth before there was ever a foundation of the world or somebody ought to say praise the Lord somebody ought to say my name's there yeah if you know your name's there it takes a lot of Doubt away from you it takes a lot of fear away from your life because you can see who you were in the word of God because you always were a Son of God you just had to be quickened in this hour to the newness of life oh I hope you're hearing me this is not just another message but it can take another dead church member that was sitting out there in a Pentecostal church maybe they were dancing maybe they were shouting and that's okay maybe you were having a good time but when the word come into your life it took you from just another shower from just another Runner and it made a word believe in body of Christ out of you it made you not just act good in church but it made you good on Monday morning it made you good on Tuesday morning it made your life line up with the gospel oh I hope you hear me today I'm just about done but let me just go and say this just before we close brother Branham is showing the quickening power to the people but I like how this ends because brother Branham is showing the power and he's calling the people out but then at the end of this quote I want you to notice that he talks he challenges the people to put their hands on each other because he wants you to know it wasn't just for him now the gift was just for him to show you at the gift that must come it had to fulfill prophecy it had to fulfill the word the gift had to come in one man but then you had to see the word that came was to produce a body that would live by the same word that he was bringing to the people and so here's a lady he said looking right down here he said through here sitting looking at me she's got heart trouble do you believe that God will heal the heart trouble you were sitting there praying he said I wish oh you were sitting there praying I wish I could get there is that right wave your hand like this that's right how did I know what you were saying in your prayer he said just believe that's all you have to do is believe he goes on he said here's this lady here that'll die right away if she isn't healed she's got cancer he said do you believe that God will heal the cancer yes you believe it you being that was kind of slow putting up your hand do you believe that God can tell me who you are now he must have noticed when she was a little slow putting her hand up that she might have wanted him to say something about her so he goes on and he says Mrs Gunn now if that's right wave your hand like that see all right go home Jesus Christ will make you well if thou can't believe all things are possible he said that struck this lady sitting here with a dark hat on looking at me she also has cancer do you believe God will heal you I want you to notice something real quick he was noted he was Discerning their thoughts but this woman was struck by something this woman had to get the attention of the Prophet by something the woman with the issue of blood she had to get the prophet's attention by something your faith has touched the prophet your faith has touched Christ and if it has then that same body of Christ can live because the quickening power is not just in a man but it is in the word of God it is a discerner of the thoughts and the hearts do you believe God will heal you do you believe with all your heart I'm speaking to Miss Miller he says do you believe that that do you believe that I don't know this woman never seen her in my life and God in heaven knows that's right he said if thou can't believe here is a colored woman sitting right over here on the end had her head down she was studying she's studying about a loved one somebody she's praying for you telling me this is just a man you're telling me this is just another man that can stand up there with a sideshow and and a one-trick pony no this was a man that was yielding himself to God and God speaking through a prophet in our day he said no he isn't here it's her husband that's right she's not here he's at home he's had an operation hasn't he that's right he was bothered with sinus trouble and so forth that's true he's going to be all right your faith was strong for it do you believe that to be true he said can't you see that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he said ask those people it's went Plum across the audience do you believe that he's here do you feel that quickening power in you I love how he puts a tear do you feel that quickening power in you he said well that's the god that makes you well friends it wasn't brother Branham he's pointing you to the god that makes you well it was your faith that touched him it was you you have the ability to touch god with your faith he said now will you do one thing for me how many in here is sick let's see you raise your hand I wonder if you could do that today if there's somebody in here that's not feeling well maybe there's financial trouble could you raise your hand today I wonder if there's one person in here that says you have a need of God if you can put your hand up because the same God is here today he said how many is here sick let's see your hand he said now he said it's it's time to close is what he's saying it is for me I'm in the red he said now it's going he said Lay Your Hands over on each other brother branding is challenging I wonder if we could stand together now and do the same thing as musicians come I wonder if we could be challenged to the same Faith it's not just for a Prophet come on church it's not just for 1963 1964 1965 but it's for you today I wonder if you can put your hands on somebody he said now he said don't don't say a word now just lay your hands on one another he said I want you to do something any brother Brandon goes on he said the man sitting back here has a growth on his back do you believe that God will make that growth off your back Sir he said do you believe that God will make you well young fellow you're looking at me he said thought he was going to get passed by raise up your hand that's right he said you believe with all your heart brother Branham goes on he said I challenge this whole audience in the name of Jesus Christ if your conscience don't let you be seared with unbelief don't let it be frustrated can't you see the son of man the son of man in the form of a prophetic message returning back again in his church in Prophecy revealing Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he said it's been done through the age till this time he says never been done until this time there is proof of it what is the church how do you get into it when you're in there everything that Jesus Christ was you are that's what I want you to see today it's not just for a prophet it's not just for another man it's not just for one single church but everything that Christ was is yours it's who you are it's my identity I'm reflecting him today can you say amen he became me so that I can become him his power is living in us today I wonder what your head's bowed closing just with your hands on one another if we could just ask the Lord don't pray for yourself the person next to you say Lord and this is something we all need Lord send a Revival fire in their life it's in the Revival in their home Quicken the word to them so that they know that Christ is not just a god of history but he's a god that is here now I wonder if we could just with all our hearts say Lord touch my brother touch my sisters give him a Revival fire in their heart may this church just feel an anointing audit we don't have to wait for something great to happen but the presence of the Holy Ghost is here today the Holy Ghost is Among Us don't settle for second best don't settle for somebody preaching that the message is a dead word but believe that today the quickening power is here Among Us can you believe with all your hearts he said brother bear said don't throw your denomination at me it won't work he said I know he's here I'm positive he's here I know that now there is quickening power enough in the church to heal every person that's sitting here I wonder if you know that today I wonder if you know that you know that the power that was in Jesus the power that was shown through a prophet is here today he said I'm positive to heal every person he said can you believe it he said well then will you do you believe in praying for the sick do you believe Jesus said lay hands on the sick and they shall recover he said all right put your hands over on the person and he said don't pray for yourself pray for that person next to you oh I wonder if all of our hearts now we can just pray to him and say Lord the person next to me they may not be my family they may not be someone that's done anything financially for me but Lord my heart goes out to them because they have a need of Revival in their life they are the child of God they are your son or daughter of God lord I pray you would come on this audience today Lord I pray you would send a Revival in this church don't let us just have another service don't let us just have another's time of singing and celebration but let us know that we know that the body of Christ is here and we are living out the revelation of Jesus Christ in this hour oh I wonder if you could just say with all your hearts now say thank you Jesus say thank you Jesus for the power of God in this hour thank you Lord for saving my soul thank you for bringing my family back speak a positive Assurance right now Lord thank you for giving us the message of the hour thank you Lord that I'm not just another dead church member
