forth Lord move me aside Lord speak to your people Lord just meet every need every request we pray in Jesus name amen amen let turn to Psalms 73 who's happy to be in the house of the Lord tonight amen just sure enjoyed our brother Joel this morning and and uh wish he could have come and did a part two but here we are amen just kind of want to um Minister on a thought of centered upon the Revelation uh Psalms 73 and 1 I always enjoyed these scriptures it's always we'll just kind of deal with them all throughout maybe a little bit broke up but I've always enjoyed uh Psalm 73 it's always brought me encouragement for some reason it's always helped me but we read here Psalm 73 And1 a Psalm of Asaf truly God is good to Israel even to such as are of a clean heart but as for me my feet were almost gone my steps had well n slipped for I was envious at the foolish when I saw the prosperity of the wicked may the Lord bless his word this evening you can be seated just the thought of of centered upon the Revelation you know there's so many things that we can look at um even though God's a good God and has done so much for us there's things that we can look at and take our eyes off of that and so we must stay centered on Christ do you believe that there's so much uh to take our attention away from him right but there's a people I believe that and you give me just a little bit more monitor if it's too loud out there then don't do it but it might help me a little bit but there's a people I believe that is looking away from the sin and the systems and the kingdoms of this world and they are looking away to Jesus is that who you're looking to tonight we're not looking to A A Man A personality or someone that can figure something out amen we're looking away to Jesus amen and the Bible says that uh looking unto Jesus the author and the finisher of our faith amen he that that began a good work he will finish it and so that's who we're looking to tonight amen amen but the the Bible says here that that he's a a good God to those who are of a clean heart I believe that's who I'm preaching to tonight amen the the the clean and hard the sincere amen those that have been purified by the blood amen emptied themselves out from the world from the things of the world that God could come and feel that God could come and move and so he's a good God to those that are clean in heart and that word heart there is the inner man it's the will that inner man that part of you the soul the understanding amen it's it's the heart of man where where where uh the mind and the knowledge and thinking the reflection the memory there the the definition is it's it's who you are it's the inside of you and so that's where God come and meets the man he chose the heart of man uh Satan chose the the Mind amen but God chose the heart and that's where God will come and meet you is in that inner part of that man that inner part of that Soul amen and that Soul feeds upon the word of God that's the only thing that a that a born again believer Soul that's that's the only nourishment that it can get us from the word of God Amen we we can feed our bodies with with with food and we've got to do that and and these spirits that we have you know we we like to enjoy things of life and entertainment different things there's nothing wrong with that but too much of that amen the inner man it just don't do nothing for him right and so but but God is a good god to those that are of a clean heart but we look here Christ is the mystery of God revealed he said he should be then he should be the Principal yes and if that's what he is and and we don't believe we believe it don't we he says then if he is that then he should be the Principal theme of our talking of our thinking of our singing our walks he should be the Principal theme of our life and he if he's the principal theme of The Bible and the Bible's in us then he should be the Principal thing of everything we do it should be Christ he said is that right is that is that what you think tonight is that what you believe tonight amen amen amen he is the principal theme of the scripture amen if you look at the scripture it's Redemption all the way through and he's the only one that could bring Redemption to you and I amen he is the principal thing every every individual in the Bible everything they lived out was a shadow and a representation of him amen and you and I as a bride in this last days amen amen he's got to live through you he's got to reflect himself through you and I sir come on yes so he should be the Principal thing I I just I think that's so good amen centered upon Christ it's about him it's it must be about him good we look here this Psalm written by Asaf and Asaf there if if you read he was a chief levite musician under King David and so he was a minister of worship and of the law of Moses and there at the right hand of Authority Under The King under King David he led the people in worship and understanding of the law of Moses and so I I believe that amen there's power when we worship under God's revelation of the day that we live and under that is a power Amen to to change lives under that is a is a power and an atmosphere like none under that as a is a power to bring us amen from down here to up here to bring us higher into what we should be under God's revelation of the hour right and so but Satan wants to destroy that come on now Satan hates Revelation and we'll get into that just a little bit sat and Satan understands worship yeah and knows what it means to be at God's right hand of authority and power he's held that position so he understands that but the iniquity in him caused him to fall from that estate and so Satan did not have the character to handle his position and so he will attack those in leadership even differently than others because he has been in that place of authority amen he's been in a place where he's LED worship so he understands these things and he knows how to attack and try to pull on those people that's why the Bible says we should pray for our leaders we should pray for pray for your pastor pray for those that are in authority and Leadership roles but in that position he deceived and caused many to fall from their place that God had called them to be and so we're talking about being staying centered and we've got to stay centered on on what God has called us to be he got those angels that were created to worship God that's what they were created to do and to be was to worship ship God he got their eyes on something that seemed better than what the Perfection God had designed for them and so just go along with me here a little bit like Joel said this morning we we got an extra hour of sleep so nobody should be tired nobody don't don't go to sleep on me this early and so I I will read everything in here all the way through if I got to go ahead so don't just stay with me so in that position he deceived and caused many to fall from their place that God had called them to be he got their their eyes on something different than what God had designed for them he defiled their hearts and got them away from the worship of God and so I believe we are by God's design here this evening we are here by God's predestinated plan amen as those fell as those fell amen under that Authority that he had being at the right hand of God and the influence that he had I believe we are here to stand in this hour we are predestinated to stand and not to fall from our position amen and I believe tonight if we get knocked down amen if we get knocked down there's a Grace there's Grace and there's Redemption Amen to pick us all back up amen you don't have to stay down you don't have to stay down if Satan brings you down amen there's a way up amen Grace has provided a way back up for each and every one of us do you believe that amen but we look here and I just appreciated our sister singing tonight and and did didn't you enjoy that amen let's give them a hand clap I I just appreciate these these young people and and their desire to to worship and to sing amen Praises but we look here and brother Joel said something this that triggered this and I added this in my notes but you know brother randam had a vision and a preview of the bride and so in that vision and in that preview there he saw he describes it he saw the Asian church and and as it would come by it was just filth right and as it goes on there there the European Church came by and it was just it was just filth and and there then he describes Miss America in the beauty that she was but there she came dancing and and to the beat of rock and roll he said it was just absolute filth and there he be to describe of of of the feeling that he had and that that this was all that we could produce as men ministers and amen this is this is all that we could that we've got to present to him and so yes sir come on now we look there and and as the vision goes on he says and as they marched they dropped off they begin to drop off to a certain place and I so appreciated our sisters singing and I this just uh it does good to my heart to see them but and that I added this in there but in the Rapture he said then I heard something like Onward Christian Soldiers and I looked and here come a sainted bunch of girls just exactly like they was all correctly dressed their hair hanging down way down on their back smooth and clean marching to the step of the Gospel amen I'm thankful to have a young people like that a church of people that believe the word that can that can stand in this part of the vision amen and he said they were stepping to the step of the Gospel he said she was the word amen they look like one out of every nation amen and I was looking as it passed by and seen them pass by and instead of set instead of going down they started to go up and he said I noticed get listen to this I noticed one of them two or three of them trying to get out of line I scream stay in line and the vision left me and he said the vision left me and I was still screaming stay in line if we can reiterate that tonight stay in line stay centered upon the revelation of god of what he's called you to be and and who he is and who he's called you to be stay in line yes sir don't look at the world take your eyes off the world Amen look unto Jesus the author and the finish of your faith amen amen as that church as that church was dropping off I believe I'm I'm preaching to individuals tonight that's going up amen amen they they've been dressed in the word they are the word and we're going up amen yes sir yes sir stay in line yes sir amen but we look at America 1956 brother R said America rejected the gospel right amen as bad as we wanted I I went and voted for Donald Trump as bad as we want it I don't even know if he can do any good now that's right I mean what's it matter you know it's going it's leaning more towards evil as time goes on right we want to try to have as the best life we can we understand that's why went voted for the man but but it's all in God's control right but we know that this nation has rejected the gospel there's no Revival coming for it there's no coming back amen we can try to hold on to the little bit of of the idea of of America and what what it what it was when we grew up but those days are really long gone and so they turn down the gospel they turn down their Revival and we look at America America America the American Spirit is the spirit of of laughter and Frolic and entertainment and so if we get caught up in that and you can get caught up in that I can get caught up in it you can get caught up in it amen if you find yourself caught up in it amen begin to direct your attention back to the Revelation begin to uh direct your attention back to the vision amen that I just read read amen and realize that you're living in that Vision right now we're living and we're walking amen making footsteps amen walking in that Vision so stay in line don't get caught up in the spirit the American Spirit in 1955 he says but you take the the people of a whole in America they're wellfed per purred he said they don't have to worry about anything they've got all the money they thousands of millions of dollars big Fine Cars summer homes they've got everything they don't have to worry well what's religion to them just a place to sit around well and say well I belong to a church and he said and they'll find the highest and most practical church that they can they they they can go to yeah you know they're not going to drive an hour and a half to go to church they're going to go to the the nearest one they can find that's got the class of people that they want to be identified with what's most practical what makes the most sense what where am I going to go that I'm not going to get preached at that I'm not going to get hammered at and and chastised and amen and shaped up to be a son or daughter of God they don't want nothing to do with that because they've got everything they need and that's the spirit of this age amen they're rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing amen that's the spirit that we're that that of the age and the age that we live in that's the effects amen that Tred to come upon us but Center be centered on the Revelation in this hour don't don't fall for that yes but it brother says here he says and did you know that's the very sign of Satan I hope we don't get too rough about it he said in heaven what made Lucifer jealous he goes into the the North and puts up a better Kingdom he wanted a bigger uh Kingdom a more broader better prettier he said the devil always works in Beauty he said that's the reason Cain offered what he did for his offering so Cain what did Cain do he brought the fruits of the field he he brought what he could bring what he could produce and and no doubt it looked beautiful it looked pretty but it wasn't the spiritual Revelation that God desired and that God wanted and he goes on to say but there was no Beauty in Abel bringing his lamb but Abel had a spiritual revelation of God and that's what would that God would be pleased with and as and as he said only through spiritual Revelation can you ever know God you'll never know him by knowledge and you look there even when when uh when Kain killed his brother and he said if you'll not do right will you not be accepted also but it wasn't in that serpent seed to be able to do what was right he could look upon what what Abel his brother done by spiritual Revelation he could look at it but he could never do it and brother Brandon would say Satan knows the will of God but he refuses to do it right oh my so it's not for them it's hidden from the eyes of the wise and prudent we're talking about Revelation here spiritual Revelation can only be received Amen to babes such as would learn be thankful tonight amen that you can learn from the revelation of God amen amen and that's the only way to know Jesus Christ is by the revelation of the Holy Spirit he's not known by Flesh and Blood right right amen and that's the evidence of the day amen of the Holy Ghost that you can receive the word for your day amen that in itself is the evidence that you can receive the revelation of the hour that you live in and that he is truly the same yesterday today and forever yes sir amen what' y'all have for lunch on now good feels good my wife sent over a plate just a few little green beans and few pieces of meat no dessert nothing nothing I didn't need it anyways I'm on to die you know not really amen preach with me here tonight so we look at at the Revelation there we go on with Asaf in the scriptures there Asaf he he was envious when he saw the foolish when he saw the prosperity of the wicked and so Satan wants us to take our sight off of God's Will and program for our lives but you can't look and that's s we it's too late it's too late to to look to the left or to the ride but we've got to look to him for he is the principal theme he should be the Principal theme of our walking of our talking of our singing of our everything amen we've got to stay centered on the word we've got to stay centered on Jesus Christ amen don't stop for a second and look back amen Lot's wife what happened to her just for a second she looked back and she was turned to a pillar of salt we don't have time to turn around we don't have time to look to the left or right amen we've got to March forward as good soldiers for Jesus Christ amen to to the beat of the word amen like Onward Christian Soldiers yes sir Lord help us tonight don't don't take a second to look back we don't have time for it you've got to look straight to Calvary look to the throne of God Amen tonight amen if you got a need amen amen don't stay in that negativity not tonight there's a positive that's calling you if you can look to Jesus tonight look to the one who's sitting on the throne tonight that's in control of everything amen sitting there as the perfect sacrifice for every need for every situation amen look to Calvary tonight amen look to the throne of God Amen where he sits in the right hand of of authority and power amen amen and he will give you the the strength that you need to overcome in this hour amen look and see in the message of the hour look and see turn the message on open the books look and see at the Revelation amen look and see and understand God's revelation for your life amen for by that only we shall we overcome amen God's revelation of the hour and that Revelation amen won't produce a hearty Spirit a know it all amen but it will prod produce Jesus Christ it will produce power in your life amen it will produce overcoming power for Leo deia brother Bram says in the church AG say true Revelation is a prevailing power in The Believer you believe that tonight it is the revelation of God that will give you the authority over the devil it's not your intellectual Faith it's not someone told what someone told you but it's what God showed you personally he showed you who you are he showed you who he is he showed you who the devil was amen and you know your position amen and it gives you authority over the devil he goes on in the church he says there's nothing of such prevailing power as a revelation of the word you believe that tonight that's what it's going to take and you've got to stay centered upon that Revelation he says here he said he knows Satan that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for and that she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army amen that word Invincible means too powerful to be defeated or overcome say tonight that I am Invincible say it tonight again that I am Invincible come out of the negative into the positive of who you are of the revelation of the hour amen amen and when you come into that Revelation though all hell come against you you shall stand amen amen you won't you won't be fallen but you'll stand in your position in this [Music] hour true Revelation and the true church those words are are capitalized but I want to look here what she is he said what she is and what she stands for who is she and what is her stand Amen brother Ram said in the rising of the son that she is him amen she is life of his life amen she is both mechanics and Dynamics she's not just a dead letter but she's got the spirit amen she's coming to a maturity amen where she she's she's fed upon the mechanics she studied the mechanics and we've heard these things for years and years but there's got to be a dynamic amen where se's both mechanics and Dynamics something that'll that'll spark the gas and Spark the fire amen that'll get this thing a rolling amen she's both mechanics and Dynamics amen that's who she is that's who you are in this evening amen amen what is your stand her stand is upon the revealed Vindicated truth amen he said she waits on thus sayith the Lord amen she's not waiting on a gift she's not waiting on a sensation she's not waiting on a personality or a pastor amen she waits on him and him alone because she is his alone you are his and he is yours amen you are his resp responsibility in this hour he has taking that upon himself Amen to see you through yes sir I believe it good Look Away to Jesus can't get no more simpler than that amen she waits on him because she is his alone her old life is done away with and you have come to the word in the visible Union of the bride of Christ he says you're The Virtuous bride of Christ washed in the blood of Christ precious virtuous sinless Son of God standing with a pure unadulterated bride word that he Washed by the Water of his own blood that became flesh and manifested oh my this is powerful that he might take you which were predestinated in the bosom of the father from the beginning the same as he was oh my you're going to come the same the same way that he came amen he came from the he came from God God and he went back to God anden you came from the mind of God and we're going back to that perfect thought of who God had in his mind of what we should be amen amen and God ordered your steps in this hour amen I believe tonight that nothing is out of place amen nothing amen we may walk in the permissive will of God for a little bit amen but a predestinated seed will step right back in the will of God and I believe we're walking in a Rapture Revelation in this hour amen and we're not going down but we're going up in this hour amen we're going up higher and higher yes sir good the truth yes sir you love the Lord tonight that's good we go on with Asaf in his day they had an anointed king and people under that anointing amen and under that King amen amen that he showed his power through those people amen as long as they were were Amen in the will of God and so when they messed up is when they didn't consult God's Prophet but as long as they consulted God's Prophet amen and and went about God's Divine Way and God's divine blessing they were in God's will and his Blessing amen as long as they stayed in that order amen God fought their battles amen amen they had faith in that God Amen in that anointing of that day that God would bring the victory in every battle amen every battle as long as they were under the divine order that God has set for them even look amen amen when the ark returned amen when when they brought it back the right way it brought Revival it brought dancing amen it brought the power of the Holy Ghost among them when the word returned back to him amen it brought Revival yes sir and so in this day we have the anointed word amen we have the king sword amen we have the third poor that's what's been given to you and I amen you come out of everything else amen you come under the revelation of the hour and under the revelation of the hour amen the king sword amen the spoken word amen came in this day amen and I believe whatsoever things as the Bible says whatsoever things you say Amen what you ask for you shall have amen quit putting it off for another day amen amen that's the anointing of the hour amen that's the anointing of the day I believe that yes so we have the anointed word we have the open word it's the king sword it wasn't the thoughts of a man but God brought the Sword Down God brought the word down in this hour he brought the understanding amen he Vindicated it brought the understanding to you and I and so a People Under The Authority I believe of their messenger the people of people under the authority of their message and and its message Amen brother said will become the final voice to the final age God will speak once more amen through his bride amen she'll not go out of here and defeat but she'll go out here in Victory amen she's not going to go out here on a personality but she's going to go out under the revelation of who she is of who he is amen understanding the devil amen understanding his tricks and by that they will overcome this age I really just wanted to preach about 20 minutes tonight and so they become the final voice of the final age that's who you are yes sir amen it's a people with clean Hearts A people with clean lives dedicated to God service dedicated Amen to the moving of his Spirit to meet the challenge of the day to meet the challenge of the hour and and and and God has always had Heroes of Faith God has always had somebody amen Heroes of of the revelation of the hour to meet the challenges of their day do you believe that I believe I'm looking at some now I believe that Hebrews 11:33 let's look at some Heroes here these people have already fought their fight yeah they've already overcome right who through faith subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness you think you can't do anything take faith in this these people subdued kingdoms by faith wrought righteousness obtained promises stop the mouths of lions quench the violence of fire escape the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong wax Valiant and in and fight turn the flight turn to flight the armies of the aliens re women receive their dead raised to life again and others were tortured not accepting Deliverance that they might obtain a better res Resurrection let go with me here and others had trial of cruel mockings and scourging J Moore over bonds of imprisonment they were stoned they were swn asunder they were tempted were slain with the sword they wandered about in sheep skins and goat skins being destitute Afflicted tormented of whom the world is not worthy they wandered in deserts and in the mountains and the dens and the caves and all these having obtained a good report through faith through the revelation of their day re receive not the promise God having provided something better for us that they without us should not be made perfect brother R said when I read those stories of those gallan soldiers I wonder where our little testimony will stand with them at that day but I believe in this hour I believe we're fighting a different battle even than that you're fighting amen against every demon amen this Satan can let loose amen don't cut yourself short in this hour every demon that he had in back pocket everything that he could that he could think to release he has released upon this age he has released upon this bride because he wants to destroy that seed but I believe amen we shall overcome amen by the blood of the lamb and by the word of Our Testimony do you believe that tonight I believe that I'm looking at some Heroes some potential Heroes of Faith amen amen that are going to come to Perfection yes sir sometimes it may look like we're defeated all hopes lost just as them but they stay true no matter what sometimes things didn't go their way sometimes they had to give their lives Isaiah was saw aunder but he went down in faith he went down in Victory they stayed true to God no matter what they were a people of pure heart and their lives were centered upon amen God's promise amen of him to them did they have failures most definitely did they have difficulties yes but through all that they were blessed to be a part of the revelation of Jesus Christ their lives were a shadow an expression of him amen they didn't care what the critics said amen the pressures of the age didn't control them they lived what was revealed to them by God Amen they listen to the voice of God Amen as Abraham he staggered not at the promise of God brother Brown says here he says these people who died are depending and waiting on us right so this church has got to come to perfection in order to bring the resurrection I think brother Joel mentioned that even this morning the resurrection is is waiting upon you and I to come Amen to the Perfection of the revelation of this hour amen Center Center your lives upon it in this our church don't look to the left don't look to the right but Center upon the revelation of this hour improving his word he says I want you to notice he does it that way in every age he does it in every time by the same method he has to take Believers in order to have Believers to meet the word he's got to predestinate it to that age he's got to predestinate this thing to be there to meet the challenge of the day he said do you get it do you feel it do you see it do you understand he said that's what's happening today he predestinated to this bias for knowledge when he predestinated in Malachi 4 that it's God to happen and we've said these things before Malachi 4 this wasn't about Elijah the prophet but there was a people whose Hearts were turned back to an Apostolic face a an Apostolic Faith amen God by Malachi for a scriptural voice turned our hearts back Amen in this hour amen back to an Apostolic Faith amen back to a faith amen where Prison Walls can be taken down amen where chains can be broken amen amen back Amen to the pure revelation of the word that's what our hearts have been turned back to Amen to produce a pure word bride amen back to the power of the Holy Ghost God predestinated you to meet the challenge of this day nothing out of place your footsteps are right where they're supposed to be right sir amen he said did you get it amen do you get it I'm saying to you now do you get it do you feel it do you see the hour that we're we're living in do you understand it is it hard living a a Christian Life yes is it hard living L SE for these young people yes but we must endure amen as a good soldier endure hardness of times is it hard yes but God is called us to live in pureness of heart Amen to meet the challenge is it hard yes it is hard but it's worth it you believe that tonight it's worth your time it's worth your effort amen it's worth everything that you've got amen he goes on here he says when he come over and predestines anything to happen his word he he had to prove his word to be so when he predestines anything to happen and says it will happen he knows that seed will be there just at that time to meet the challenge he's predestinated a bride she's going to be there going to be a Rapture she's going to be there he predestinated by his for knowledge and there's nothing that's going to stop it there's no trick no tactic of the enemy young people there's nothing that you can face the pressures of this age can't can't get too hard amen there's going to be a Rapture there's going to be a people that'll overcome there is going to be a bride she's going to be there amen there's going to be a Rapture amen it's the promise of the hour amen rise up and meet the challenge of this hour rise up amen and make yourself ready in this hour rise up and meet the challenge that's laid before you amen only the predestinated only those covered by his grace in this hour will be able to meet that challenge amen and those that have accepted that challenge amen amen and repented of their sin amen their old life and walking in in alive and hid away with Christ only those who are pure in heart will be in that Rapture you won't be living any old way amen but you you've accepted the challenge you've accepted it I can't do it on my own amen amen this flesh amen this heart this will fail amen but God is our portion in this hour amen we have failures we have downs sittings and uprisings amen we have ins and outs amen but God is your portion in this hour Amen to meet the challenge of the dayen God Amen will bring Revelation bring understanding in the Inner Man we won't overcome by our flesh we won't over overcome by by trying to trying to go on a Rapture and trying to work it up amen but brother B said the Rapture is already in you when you receive the Holy Ghost it's already in you you're just walking in in that it's who you are yes amen I hope this is all right tonight he said in the Rapture he said the Rapture the bride it's a revelation to her yes amen and faith is a revelation of the will of God Amen the Rapture is a revelation amen it's something amen that doesn't look like it's possible it looks like there's just no way and and then and but your faith Lord help me tonight your faith calls what what doesn't seem to be it calls it amen and brings it into reality it calls it what it is amen amen and we begin to take by faith the promise of God and walk in it in the revelation of it not in this flesh not in our own human Spirits amen but a strength from the inner man amen where that heart has been been cleansed and purged amen by the blood of Jesus Christ I'm just trying to preach tonight ASAP said he said my feet were almost gone all right amen my steps had now well not slipped he began to look look at the world look at the wickedness and the Bible says he became envious at the foolish when he saw the prosperity of the wicked he said how they're not troubled and plagued as other men he said goes on in that in that chapter he said the pride their pride compasse them about as a chain so what happened ASAP begin to take his eyes off the goodness and the blessing of God to his people he began to look at the hardness of the people who didn't know or serve God and things always seem to go their way you you know what I'm talking about they go there and in in that in that chapter it says they say how does God know is there knowledge in the most high so this is the attitude of the world this is the attitude of of the world and and the and and what they're living in and what they're portraying on but he said behold these are the ungodly who prosper in the world who increase in riches and and he goes on he said within himself verily I have cleansed my heart in vain for all the day long I have been plagued and chastened every morning that word chasing there is rebuke correction punishment Ching right you ever you ever feel like that that's just all it is to you sometimes amen but that's a sign that you're a son or a daughter of God because every son or daughter of God amen amen amen must must come under this chastisement must come under this correctiv of God amen amen the Bible says when we are judged when we are chasen of the Lord amen that word chasen when you're taught when you're instructed that we should not be condemned with the world Amen I'm chastised they're always telling me what I'm doing wrong and but that's God's corrective love because he doesn't want you to be judged by the world or with the world so he was troubled Asaf was troubled at the thought of the wicked just being able to get get by with anything questioning God and yet still being prosperous it bothered him and but the pure and heart are always are always um the pure in heart are always rebuked and ched they're always going to receive that chastisement because God God Amen God's love is corrective amen sometimes amen do you ever do you ever just stop and think what's really going on here you know what's really going I'm trying to live a Christian life according to the word and the message amen Things become so hard amen Things become so hard and we begin to look more at the seen than the Unseen amen but that's when our faith must be centered back on the word of God back on God's promise for our day I say quit looking at the things that's going on around you amen look to the inner man amen let that inner man amen be strengthened amen keep that inner Man strengthened by the word of God and of understanding I'll try to hurry here Psalm 73 and 16 he just ASAP just couldn't understand I go through all this I'm corrected constantly these people just have any old attitude and and they're they're continuously prospering but he says here when I thought to know this it was too painful for me until I went into the sanctuary of God then I understood therein therein amen he went into the sanctuary of God he went into the Tabernacle of God Amen he went into that secret place to get understanding Amen to settle the trouble that he had within himself amen he went to that sanctuary of God and there received understanding amen he shut himself self in Amen to get understanding amen and he's seen there he said there're set in Slippery places amen they will be cast down destruction he begin to see their End Amen they are brought into desolation as in a moment they are consumed with tears amen and the Bible says that God despises the image amen of the life that is hid away from them from him he despises their wickedness and their question against his knowledge and who he is he went to the temple of God he went to the Sanctuary to get understanding and he seen their end though their lives seem prosperous though this world continues to go on like it does Amen their end is destruction sir oh my Ephesians 515 see that you walk circumspectly not as fools but as wise Redeeming the time because the days are evil wherefore be not unwise but understanding what the will of the Lord is that word circumspectly means to walk diligently to walk perfect Amen to walk accurately Amen to walk in perfect faith and perfect love in him y'all got a little bit more time praise the Lord how much more time you got I ain't got my watch is that did we set that one up yes yeah I'm sure I'm sure we did so we wouldn't be messed up you love the Lord tonight amen It Ain't Easy getting up here preaching I'll tell you that right now it ain't easy amen love the Lord amen but brother BR says here the reason we don't have spiritual blessings he said we have too much time to watch television too much time to read the newspaper and to listen or to something that we ought not to be listening to and we're not Redeeming the time but we're giving into the things of the world instead of our time to the Lord Jesus and the Bible said that man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth proceeded from the mouth of God he said Christians live on the word so redeem the time because the days are are evil but what is it today it's not so much newspapers and certainly television but but what is it it's the internet Facebook Instagram Snapchat I've got I've got every bit of that but we spend too much time time we spend too much time looking at other people's perfect life seems like it's perfect and thinking how everyone has it so good and and their lives are so perfect and Problem free and it brings a negative effect upon your spirit amen and I I say tonight that there's no strength there's no virtues in those things amen it's a complete waste of time amen those things I mean it offers no strength to the inner man there's no virtue there's no Grace anden there's no rapturing faith faith in any of that but Philippians 4 said finally Brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things of a good report if there being any virtue if there being any praise think on these things amen if you want to come out of the negative amen you've got to you've got to you've got to push towards the positive in this hour amen and these things amen that we spend too much time on we waste too much time on it's nothing but the negative amen there's no virtue there's no strength in it I say push tonight to the positive push towards the revelation of the hour amen medit meditate on Jesus Christ amen not just his word amen not just your favorite scripture but uh meditate on who he is who his power is who he's personally revealed himself to you sir we want to see more of God we want more of the blessings of God brother said he said meditate on him yes than about him and watch him come on the scene amen do we have time for that do I have time for it do we have time to sit still long enough and to come into the sanctuary come into His presence amen because there is where the blessings lie that's where rapturing Faith amen amen the faith and the strength that you need to walk in this hour you won't find it on the external but it will be in the internal on is where we find that that strength amen I say drop the negatives of this life drop the negative amen don't stay so much in the negative come into the positive I read this this morning I thought I thought it was so good brother Rand said here in questions and answer I'll try to hurry up all right I'll try to hurry up I'm lean over here like I'm about to be done but I'm really not all right this is pretty good all right listen to it okay don't go to sleep if you're older I understand if you're a little kid had too much candy you're coming off that Sugar I understand it's all right everybody else is not okay wake up he says here the question is an answer brother what shall we do something is settled over me that I cannot break through last fall I dreamed I was lost in white sand it was getting dark and I couldn't find my way and this dream has stayed with me since last fall I was as as one groping in darkness my son Irvin and wife were included in my dream they were also in darkness and we're in desperation I believe God will show you what it is what is in our hearts now he said if we're wrong or s in sinning places say tell us we want to be right sincere honest in heart pure in heart he said I I don't know the lady but I just feel that you're in here lady that here is your trouble you have let something happen to you that's just made you nervous because being in White Sands represents Purity and righteous and you're just letting Satan put one over on you you dream your dream prove that there's nothing wrong you're only nervous and by doing this and thinking this you're making the rest of your family nervous stop doing it claim your god-given rights your dream proves by the interpretation that you're in white sand everything's all right come on it's you yourself nervous he said you let one family member uh uh member of the family get nervous it goes right to the next member and the next member and the first thing you know we're all fussing and going on and one member of the family gets kind of upset about something he upsets the other and the other and the other the first thing you know the whole family's upset it's Satan yeah then if one member of the family rejoices let the rest of them Rejoice with it so every one of the family must try to do that you got to come out of the negative into the positive anden we she was spending too much time in that negative she had said last fall I had this dream I've been in this condition she was dwelling in the negative she was dwelling in that nervousness and that's all it was there wasn't no no sin or nothing like that they were in pure Sands they were in pureness in righteousness but she let it go on too long I hear a prophet explaining so good here he said try each one of you children to help your papa your mama mama papa you try to help your children don't let that gloomy unbelieving Spirit get around you you're Christians you're born of the spirit of God you're the salt of the earth you have god-given rights am me he said in the Bible said if there be any praise if there be any virtue think on these things amen don't think about the wrong sister I think that's your trouble sister dear she was thinking too much about the wrong amen come out of the negative in this hour Asaf begin to look at the negative amen but but there he he starts out amen surely God is good to Israel surely God is good amen to the pure in heart amen amen let's go back amen let's go back to the center of the revelation of what God has done for us in this hour man don't dwell in your nervousness don't dwell in what Satan wants you to dwell in come out of that in this hour man have faith amen amen come under the revelation of the Rapture let's walk up high in this day amen true good we'll just try to end here talking about Revelation Jesus asked them he said who do men say I the son of man am and they said some said you're alive some say you're John the Baptist but he said but who do you say that I am and Peter there said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God it was spiritually revealed to him he said Flesh and Blood hath not revealed this but my Father which is in heaven has revealed this to you and brother B says and Upon This Rock of Revelation who Jesus Christ is he is the fo manifested God he said not a father and a son and him being the second person but he said Upon This Rock I'll build my church in the Gates of Hell will never shake it down will never Prevail against him this is what I want to finish up on look Christ in you makes him the center of the Revelation so it's Christ in you the hope of glory amen it's not what you can do it's not what I can do but it's Christ in you the hope of glory it's Christ in you see Christ's life in you makes him the center of the Revelation Christ in the Bible makes the Bible the complete revelation of Christ Christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing try to understand that him and you they without us cannot be made perfect amen it's a Rapture
