[singing] [music] Great is the measure of our father [music] love. I've had many tears and sorrows. I've had questions for tomorrow. There have been times [singing and music] I didn't know right from wrong. But in every situation, God gave [music and singing] blessed consolation that my trials only [singing] come to make me strong. Through it all, through it all, I've learned to trust in Jesus. I've [music] learned trust in God. Through it all, through it all, I've learned to depend upon his word. I've been a lot of places and I've seen a lot of faces. There have been times [singing] when I felt so all along. But in [music] my lonely hours, yes, those precious lonely [singing and music] hours, Jesus let me know [singing] I was [music] his own. Through it all, through it [singing] all, I've learned to trust in Jesus. I've learned to trust in God. Through it all, through it all, I've learned to depend [music] upon his word. I thank [music and singing] him for the mountains and I thank him [singing] for [music] the valleys. I thank him for the storms he's [singing] brought me through. For if I've never had a problem, [music] I wouldn't know that [singing] God could solve it. I never [music] know what faith in God can. Just raise your hands and sing it. Through it all.

Got several that are [music] sick and battling different uh things. Sister uh Sister Alice battling cancer and brother Robert with heart disease that he's been battling. [music] I think he goes in tomorrow. Brother Wes has a court case tomorrow. Praying for brother Wes and his mother as [music] well with her needs in her body. I know there's many others I'm not thinking of, but we believe [music] in a prayer answering God. And he he's always on time. It might seem late for us, but he's always on time. We got so many missing tonight. In fact, most of the church appreciate some of you visitors showing up, but it's good to be in the house of the Lord anyway. [music] We're just going to bind together and pray and believe that God meet these needs. I spoke to Brother Robbie Jones last night and Sister Betty is not doing well at all either. And we just need to really be praying for her and just believing for all of these that are sick. Let's bow our heads together. Maybe you've got a a need you'd like to make known by way of uplifted hand. God sees every need. He knows every heart. [music] Heavenly Father, we're so grateful to be in your presence once again and to thank you for your goodness, Lord, on us. Thank you for your grace, Lord. [music] Thank you, Lord, that you chose us and you called us, Lord. Though we may be few in number, but you said we're two or three are gathered together, I will be in the midst. And we believe that today, God. I pray that you'd meet our needs. I pray especially for these that are sick. Lord, the doctors maybe have done all that they can do, but we're believing for a miracle. Lord, I pray that you'd move for our elders. Father, Brother Bill as well going in for surgery this week. I I pray that you'd move, God. I pray that you'd strengthen their bodies. I pray that you'd guide the doctor's hand, do a miracle, Lord, in their lives. I pray you'd grant it tonight. [music] Lord, I pray that you'd bless the preaching of your word. As brother Joel preaches tonight, I pray that you'd just open up our hearts to receive. Lord, we can have an upper room experience [music] in this service. Lord, pray that you'd grant it.

Wherever I go, I [singing] came [music] to glorify. glorify your name. Is that what you came to do tonight? I wonder if we just bow our heads together and go to the Lord in a word of prayer. If you have a need on your heart this evening, I wonder if you just slip a hand up to him. Heavenly Father, as we come this evening, Lord, to approach [music] your word, we ask, Lord, that you would just meet with us this evening, Lord, and just speak to our hearts. Lord, I ask you wouldn't let me say [music] anything that would be out of order, Lord. But I pray you would just move me to say the things that are needful to this congregation here tonight. And Lord, [music] I ask, Lord, you would just, Lord, just bless the hearer now, Lord. May the word that goes forth, may [music] it just be something, Lord, that would be directly, Lord, to a need in their lives. And Lord, we ask, Lord, that this wouldn't be just another service, Lord. But [music] we ask you would come by in a special way now, Lord, and meet with each and every one of us. Lord, I pray you would just bind my lips, Lord, to [music] speak only what you would have me to speak. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we ask all these things. And the bride says, [music] "Amen." Amen. Are you happy to be in church tonight? If you have your Bibles this evening, if you would uh turn to cha James chapter 2, James chapter 2 and verse 19. James 2 and 19. I mean, I know it's right after Thanksgiving and and uh so I won't preach too long. Some of you are in a turkey coma still and uh I'm getting out of it myself. It's that uh binge eating you do on Thanksgiving. It ain't it ain't good few days afterwards, don't seems like. But Amen. Hope hope uh I text a brother the other day and he said, "Don't preach on gluttony this weekend." [snorts] And so I won't. Amen. And if I had a a text tonight, it would be faith must have a resting place. How many believes that tonight? &gt;&gt; In James 2 and chap and verse 19 says, "Thou believest that there is one God and thou doest well. The devils also believe and tremble." And you may be seated. May the Lord add his blessings to the word tonight. And we'll read while you have your Bibles there. Mark chapter 9 and verse 17. Mark 9 and 17. And one of the multitude answered and said un said, Master, I have brought unto thee my son, which hath a dumb spirit, and wheresoever he taketh him, he teareth him, and he foamth and nashethth with his teeth, and pineth away. And I spake to thy disciples that they should cast him out. And they could not. And he answerth him, and saith, Oh faithless generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I suffer you? Bring him unto me. And they brought him unto him. And when he saw him, straightway the spirit tear him, and he fell on the ground, and wallowed foaming. And he asked his father, "How long is it ago since this came unto him?" And he said, "Of a child." And of times it hath cast him into the fire and into the waters to destroy him. But if thou can't do anything, have compassion on us and help us. And Jesus said unto him, "If thou can't believe, all things are possible to him that believeth." Can you say amen here tonight? And he said straightway the father of the child cried out and saith with tears, Lord, I believe. Help thou mine unbelief. Amen. That's the cry of many of us here tonight. Amen. I believe, but Lord, help thou mine unbelief. And in James, we'll go back to James 2 and go down to verse 14. And it says it like this. What do it profit my brethren? Though a man say he hath faith and have not works, can faith save him? If a brother or sister be naked and destitute of daily food, and one of you say unto them, "Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled, notwithstanding you give them not those things which are needful to the body," what does it profit? And even so, faith, if it hath not works, is dead being alone. So, we find that your faith has got to have a resting place. Faith has got to have a place, amen, that it can come back to. Faith is not something you can't you can't say, "Well, I have faith in something that doesn't exist." Because you you know, as a human being, we we're we have senses. We have a a see, taste, feel, smell, and hear. And and all of those senses are are proof to us that something exists. I can look at something and I can believe that it's real. I can feel something and I believe it's real. I can taste it and I can say that turkey was good. And I can, you know, there's so many things. Amen. There there senses that we go by as a human. And yet none of those things are really what we go by as a as a Christian because uh feelings can lie to you. And you know, you can see something and it may not be just the way that you think it is. And you know, you can you can misjudge a situation because you think it's a certain way and you were seeing the situation, but you don't know what's in the heart. And so many times we have we have found ourselves that we don't have faith in the right resting place. Amen. But if you go back to where Jesus uh tells Peter, amen, upon the rock of revelation is where he would build his church and the gates of hell would not prevail. It was because Jesus said, "Who do you say that I am?" He said, he said uh he said, "Thou art the Christ, the son of the living God." And he said, "That is the revelation." Brother Brandham calls it a rock of revelation. It is actually faith. It is where everything would be built upon was the revelation of who he is. And so then if you know who he is, then you can have faith in who you are. Can you say amen here tonight? And so, Brother Brandon would say it like this. Faith is not based upon the shifting sands of man's ideas. So it's not built upon your opinion or my opinion. It is not built upon what you think the message said or what I think the message said. Amen. But it's got to go back to what the word actually says. And so, Brother Brandon would go on. He said, "I come here and told you there was an angel." He said, "If I told you there was an angel here in the building and these things happening, if I didn't have something to prove that to you, you'd have a right to doubt it." Sure you would. He said, "If I said God gave a gift to do a certain thing and you seen it come right back around and fail, you'd say that's wrong. But when it comes back and God proves it every time to be perfect, then that's right." He said, "God has proved it." Faith has to have a resting place. Amen. We could we could look at this message and if it was just the message that came, you could you could believe it if you went back to the word and checked it out. Amen. But something had to get your attention so that faith would have a resting place. Are you still with me here tonight? Amen. That's why a prophet would say, he said, I'm standing here and he said, but there's got to be something to prove and to vindicate the message that it is true. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, it wasn't brother Brandham standing standing there saying just believe me. Just believe me. It'll be all right. Just believe what I say. No, what he was telling you was, look, it's not me. It's him coming here. He's doing the works. Now, you can believe me to be his prophet. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen. But we had he had to have faith in something in order to get the people to believe. And he said, "If he said, if I can get the people to believe me, then nothing can stand in the way." Amen. But there has to be a way and there has to be a faithbuing thing, something to get your rest, your faith to rest on. And so, brother going like this. He said, he said, "If you're going to get married, some of you young men or women, if you're going to get married, you got to have faith in one another." Now, Brother Ram deals with that. Amen. Because if you really don't believe in that person, then you should never marry that person. Amen. If you don't believe in each other, if you don't believe in the people in the church, if you don't believe in your pastor, he can't help you. There's got to be faith. Listen, church, I understand we fail each other every day. I understand that men will fail you. Amen. But you do have to put a certain element of faith in people &gt;&gt; because your p you got to have a pastor. And to have a pastor, you have to put faith in a man. And if you if you have a wife, you you have to put faith in that woman. And if you you women, if you have a husband, you've got to put faith in that man. Amen. If God puts you together, you got to have faith in them. Though they may fail you, you've got TO PUT YOUR FAITH there because you've chosen them. You believe that they would be what God has for you. And so, Brother Rain would go on like this. He said, "Now, the only solid resting place for faith is on God's word." word. And so when I say a marriage has faith, I want you to notice that the faith actually comes by whatsoever God hath joined together, let no man put us under. So if your marriage is based on the word, you can have faith in it. If your marriage is based on, listen, if I if you if you don't yoke yourself with an unbeliever, then you can have faith in your marriage. If you don't yoke yourself to the world, then you can have faith in your experience. Are you with me here tonight? Amen. God did not want you, amen, to go outside of his word because outside of his word, there's no faith found. But if you come under subjection to the word, then you can have faith in the word that has been given to you. Brother R would say it like this. He said, he said, he said, the only solid rock of any faith that anybody wants to have in the supernatural, it must be placed first in the word of the living God. He said now it's been through all the ages how the men of old and all the ages when they would rally and find really find the word of God and when grasp it faith went into action right away. He said look at Noah way back in Genesis when God spoke to Noah that day the word of God came to Noah and he told him to build an ark for the saving of his household. He said you know the world stood upright before theian destruction &gt;&gt; and it wasn't leaning back like this to bring water. And when God told Noah he was going to send a flood, he said, "Now, you know, he had critics, but faith doesn't look what the circumstances is. Faith looks to what God says. Faith don't try to reason. Faith just takes it at its face value." He said, "Now, there's two different kinds what we call faith today." And he said, "I'm sorry to say this to my audience tonight." He said, "But I'm real sure of this, that there's too much intellectual faith instead of being heart faith." Come on, church. Amen. There's too much of I think it might be right or I think it could be this way. No, you got to get it on your heart and then you can rest your soul on it. Amen. Because if it's a heart faith, then you believe from the heart and none of these things will move you upon the rock of revelation and the faith that is in your heart. Amen. None of these things will move you. It is a rock of revelation that the word that has been given you is right. &gt;&gt; And so if the rock of revelation is there, it is a place that your faith can rest on. Are you with me now tonight? He said, I'm sorry to say this. Amen. But there's too much intellectual faith. Brother goes on. He said, "There's so many revivals going across the country and people are claiming to be saved and great evangelists saying they had so many thousands saved and so forth." He said, "Well, if you go back," he said that they they've got an emotion in the meeting and they're worked away. He said, "Many people in the meeting raise up and claim healing or walk away more emotion or more by psychic than they do by real divine revelation of the Lord Jesus." And the first little pain strikes them, they give up and say, "Well, I didn't get my healing." He said, "Now, if you really believe that with your heart, 10,000 pains would never make you give it up." He said, "Cuz your faith is already went into motion, you're in action, right?" Then, can you say, "Amen." Amen. If you really believe with your heart, it don't matter what the symptoms are on Monday morning. It don't matter, Amen. what the doctor's report is. Can you say, "Amen." Amen. You say, "Well, I I just don't feel saved." Well, you don't have to feel saved, amen, to believe that the experience you had WITH GOD IS REAL. YOU DON'T HAVE TO FEEL LIKE YOU GOT HEALED TO KNOW THAT BY HIS STRIPES WE ARE HEALED. THAT'S THE RESTING place of YOUR FAITH. IT'S NOT ON YOUR FEELINGS. IT'S NOT ON YOUR EMOTION. IT'S NOT ON A SENSATION. BUT IT IS ALWAYS ON THE WORD OF GOD. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen tonight? Amen. Brother Brand would say it like this. He goes on down. He said, "When God spoke to Noah, he told him the impossible. There was no rain. Never had rained. It never was a cloud in the sky or anything else. But Noah knew that it was going to rain because God said so." I wonder if we had some Noah in the building here tonight. Amen. That could say, "We don't really care what we feel like. We don't care what's going on around us, but God said so." And if God said so, we're going to stand against every critic and against every person that says it ain't going to happen. There's not going to be a rapture. The message ain't right. This, that, or the other. Amen. We can stand in the face of the critics and just keep on building the ark that God has called us to build. &gt;&gt; Brother would go on like this. He said he was considered a fanatic. He was considered a little crazy. He said, "I suppose in this day a real fanatic and almost always are. When you find people that'll dare to take God at his word, they're considered neurotics or fanatics. That's right. The real true believer has never had the world to pat him on the back, it's always been against him because he takes God at his word. How about you here tonight? He said God has never been a friend of the world in the way of the world being a friend of God. He said they're against God because they can't understand God. And you'll never know God only by faith. Can the church say amen? Brother Random goes on like this. He said now he said there'll never be uh he said no matter how much science comb the globe and said there'll never be clouds up there's no rain to come down if God's word said that it's going to rain it's up to God to make a way for the rain if God said so that settles it now where I'm going here tonight amen is there is an authority in the word and whatever the word says is right no matter what your opinion of the word is can you say amen faith has got to have a resting place that is beyond your feelings that is beyond your emotion is beyond what you think you understand of the message. Faith is always resting in the word. Can you say amen? Brother, I'm going to go on like this. He said, "Now, this little group here ought to do tonight is take God for what he says. Don't make no difference how it looks. Don't reason it. You've only got intellectual faith. You'll reason God's word. You'll try to reason and say, "Now, let me see. Now, the doctor said I can't get well. If the doctor said so, that ought to settle." That's the reason faith don't reason. He said, "That's the reason. Faith don't reason. &gt;&gt; Faith believes it anyhow. Faith believes even if the doctor says you can't make it another day. Faith believes when you said, "Amen, the doctor will say you're full OF CANCER AND THE DOCTOR SAID MAYBE YOU'VE GOT SIX MONTHS to live." AMEN. BUT I'M SO GLAD TO KNOW THAT MY GOD HAS THE FINAL SAY. AMEN. It's not up to what the doctor say. Listen, church, I believe in doctors and he's given you an exact medical opinion. Amen. But I WANT TO GO AHEAD AND TELL YOU SOMETHING. The word has always been greater than a doctor's report. The word has ALWAYS BEEN GREATER THAN YOUR FEELINGS. THE WORD HAS ALWAYS BEEN greater than church trouble. The word has always BEEN GREATER THAN WHAT YOU'RE going through right now. The word has brought you through to where you ARE TODAY. AND THE word is where you can rest all of your faith. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen tonight? Brother Brandham said it like this. If you just got a mental conception of the Bible, you say, "Well, I believe it because I read it." God's got to reveal it to you by your heart. &gt;&gt; Well, I read the Bible every day. If you just read it and let it become a dead letter to you, then then that's all it'll ever be. But if the spirit ever quickens the word to you, amen, that it will actually reveal the hidden parts in the Bible by the prophet messenger that came in our day. Now, I want you to notice, you can't have it unless it comes through a prophet first. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Think about it. Amen. He reveals nothing until he reveals it first to his prophets. And so we believe in our day, amen, that if you you could take somebody in the world, you could take a a nominal Christian as good as they might be that could read their Bible and pray every day. Amen. But if they have not come in contact, amen, with the message of the hour, they'll never see the opening of the word that has been open to our hour. They can see the Bible. They can read the Bible. And they can read the book of Revelations. It'll remain a book of symbols to them. I mean, they can read about faith. And it's just a it's an action that happened maybe 2,000 years ago. Amen. They can say, "Well, this is how we should have church." BUT THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW REALLY HOW TO HAVE CHURCH LIKE THE APOSTLES DID. AND BUT WE HAD A PROPHET THAT came and opened the seals to us. Amen. The seals were loosed off the book and we could see where faith really is. And we could see where the book was open to us. And we could SEE WHERE THE HOLY GHOST WOULD come into the believer and how it would act and what IT WOULD DO. COME ON, CHURCH. We are the only ones that have a reason to shout and worship. WHY? BECAUSE GOD HAS COME AND SHOWED US what faith is. is resting in his revealed word of the hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not re It's not resting in a in a historical God. It's not resting, Amen, just in a in a story that happened, but it's resting in a living God because the word is God. If the word was God, it still is God. And so our our our faith is resting in God, which is the word that has been revealed to us. Now, it can't just be a a revealing in the head, but it's got to be a heart revelation. Are you with me so far? Brother Brandham says like this. If a man really believes it from his heart, he's not afraid to put it to a test. He said, "If you're just mentally, you'll reason it out." Say, "Well, I couldn't do that. I might do it this way. Might have done this. Might have." He said, "I might have got well, but I don't know about myself." But if you've really based your faith on God's eternal word, and it's down in your heart, all devils out of torment can't upset you. &gt;&gt; What can you say, amen, tonight? All devils out of torment can't even upset you. Are you are you seeing where I'm going here? Amen. The rock of revelation and the faith that you have is built upon that. Then all the devils in hell can never shake that revelation that is in your soul. Amen. You you CAN BE TALKED OUT OF BELIEVING SOMETHING IF YOU SEE IT with your mind. You can be you you can change your mind. Amen. But God does not change his word. And so if it's been revealed to you, then if it ever was true, it always will be true. &gt;&gt; Amen. So God did not give you God did not give you a revelation and then change the revelation. If God gave you a revelation, it is an eternal revelation. God does not give you an revelation of one day and say, "Well, here's a revelation of going to church and tomorrow he changes that." No sir. Amen. The Bible is the ultimate. The Bible was the brother Brandham's absolute. Amen. And he came and opened that word to us. And I'll say it like this. The message is absolutely my absolute. Amen. It is where my faith is tied to. It is what my faith is RESTING ON. AND THEN WHY? Because he didn't go write his own Bible or make a Book of Mormon, but he actually took the Bible and opened it to US AND TIED UP ALL THE LOOSE ENDS. It wasn't a new message, BUT IT WAS THE OLD GOSPEL THAT WAS OPEN TO THE people of this day. I want you to hear me tonight, church, for the next few minutes. Faith is not built upon A HISTORICAL GOD. FAITH IS NOT BUILT UPON just a book, but faith is built upon the the the author of the book. Amen. And that is where our faith can sit. I mean, IT CAN BE PLACED SOLID ON THE RESTING PLACE. I MEAN, THE rock of revelation. Brother Brandon would say it like this. He said, "No, sir. You've got to stay there." He said, "Oh, in the eternal word, you've got to stay there. I know what I speak of because I've seen it and I put it to the test myself and I know that it's true." Why would I stand here on the platform at any night and challenge an audience of thousands, stood in Bombay, India, and 500,000 people and challenged them. 17 different religions come to the platform to show me one visible sign of a supernatural being and stood right in the midst of the atheists and unbelievers and witch doctors and everything else standing out there by the dozens trying to spew throw a spell on me and challenged a blind man. He said and God gave his sight right there and turned the whole thing around. Why? God said he would do it and that's all. &gt;&gt; See, brother Brandham did not it wasn't how brother Brandham felt. It wasn't how brother Brandham thought. Can I open this blind man eyes? NO. IF GOD comes on the scene, then God can do the impossible. He He He's talking about Noah back there and he said God could do the impossible by the word that he spoke to Noah. I want you to notice that when Moses heard the voice of God in the bush. Amen. It was it WAS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SOMEONE WHO HAD NOT HEARD THE VOICE OF GOD, BUT BECAUSE HE HEARD THE VOICE, then he had SOMETHING TO REST HIS FAITH UPON. Come on, somebody. Anybody else would have said, "Well, I was out in the wilderness and and a prophet told me that they heard a voice and he's going to and I guess I'm going to go down and take over." No, sir. It had to be someone who was so sure of the vindication that they actually saw it themselves. Amen. A prophet would come and he would leave this dimension and go into look into another dimension and actually see things and he could come back and show us and he had faith in it. Why? Because he was there. &gt;&gt; Now, you could say, "Well, I wasn't there." BUT THEN HE SHOWED YOU WITH HIS BACK TO THE AUDIENCE and he said, "Now I in this day, this is what was fulfilled in the scripture." Come on, church. DO YOU NOT REALIZE THAT WE HAVE THINGS WE CAN SEE? We can actually place our faith in this message. It's not something we WERE TOLD ABOUT, BUT IT'S something we can see and we can HEAR AND WE CAN PLACE OUR FAITH IN IT. WHY? BECAUSE NOW IT IS NOT JUST ON TAPE, BUT THE REVELATION IS IN THE HEART OF THE BELIEVER. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; SEE, the revelation when it was just on TAPE FOR BROTHER BRANDHAM, THAT'S GOOD. BUT THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH for you. You can listen to WHAT BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID AND SAY, "WELL, that's good. THAT'S GOOD. AMEN. I BELIEVE IT." AND THAT'S JUST THE FIRST STEP. REMEMBER THE first scripture we we read there. Satan also believes and trembles. &gt;&gt; Satan listens to THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. SATAN KNOWS IT'S TRUE. AMEN. BUT HE HAS NO REVELATION of the message because he doesn't have Come on, church. But you have been saved and filled WITH THE HOLY GHOST AND THE WORD HAS COME INTO YOU AND HAS BEEN IGNITED. AND SO NOW YOU CAN SEE WHO YOU ARE IN THE MESSAGE. YOU HAVE FAITH in the revealing of the word. &gt;&gt; I hope you're with me here tonight. This is on my heart burning up tonight. I want to tell you something. That's why we don't place it on any man. It don't matter if it was Moses or Elijah. Listen, I want you to notice Moses didn't even go to the promised land. Amen. But the words of Moses, Joshua would quote them on the other side. See, brother Brandon MAY NOT BE HERE TONIGHT, BUT I CAN STILL QUOTE A PROPHET BECAUSE I'M resting my faith on the word that he preached. He don't have to be in here in flesh. Amen. For faith to still be working. There's a group of people who have picked UP THE WORD OF GOD AND THEY HAVE NOT LEFT IT ON a tape. They have not left it on a book, but they have picked it up and they are using it. IT IS NIGH THEE even in thy mouth. AND WE ARE SPEAKING THE WORD and the faith is taking hold of the believer. Come on, church. The faith is here to ignite something ON THE INSIDE OF YOU. I WANT YOU TO KNOW TONIGHT IF YOU'RE SICK, YOU DON'T HAVE TO LEAVE THIS BUILDING SICK. TONIGHT, IF YOU FEEL DEPRESSION, DEPRESSION HAS NO HOLD ON YOU HERE TONIGHT. THIS IS NOT A FEEL-GOOD MESSAGE, BUT IT IS A BELIEF THAT WE HAVE THE WORD OF GOD THAT HAS BEEN REVEALED TO US. AND THERE IS NOT A DEVIL IN HELL THAT CAN STAND AGAINST THE ROCK OF REVELATION. &gt;&gt; Not a devil in hell can rise up against our FAITH BECAUSE THE FAITH IS NOT IN IN just brother Joel. The faith is not in brother Ben. AMEN. OR ANY OF THESE other ministers SITTING HERE, BUT THE FAITH IS IN THE WORD OF GOD. &gt;&gt; Are you with me here tonight? &gt;&gt; And my brother would say it like this. He said, "Pharaoh, if he would have looked into the word of God, he would have changed his attitude towards Moses and the rest of the Israelites." &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; The reason he doubted is because he couldn't see the word that was opened to his day, for his day. &gt;&gt; I hope you're with me now. The reason people call you a fanatic and a holy roller and the reason they call you all kinds of an oddball or whatever else they call you, I want you to know why they do that, it's because they can't see what you see. &gt;&gt; THAT DON'T MEAN THEY'RE BAD PEOPLE, but they were not called to what you're called to. &gt;&gt; Come on, &gt;&gt; brother going like this. He said now he said if looked into the word of God, he said God promised by his word he was going to bring the children of Israel out of Egypt, he would have done it. He would have changed his attitude towards the people. But he was so busy. He went to church, a very religious man. He went to church and he was a what you call a mental believer, a psychic believer, whatever you want to call it. He had a knowledge of what he was going uh what he was doing in a middle way. But he said to have a real revelation that God was going to keep that word. If he'd have had that, he would have he would have acted toward Moses, wouldn't have acted toward Moses the way he did. So even Pharaoh could have had a revelation had he read the word that was promised in his generation, but he wasn't revealed to him. Now Moses's faith did not rest upon what he could do with the biggest army in the world. It didn't rest on what he could do sitting on Pharaoh's throne as a Pharaoh. His faith rested upon thus sayeth the Lord and what it said he had to do. He said he'd have to he cho if he chose to sit on Pharaoh's throne, there'd have been a little maidens come by and given him wine and everything and they'd have brought him food and everything. But he looked out into the desert would would take two million Jews with with not much more than heathens to take them out there in the desert where it wasn't even growing a thing. And he had to feed them in the journey for 40 years. He had uh uh deserts and disappointments and everything ahead of him. But God's word give the promise that he'd take them to the promised land. And Moses took out after God's word. I want you to know that Moses did not take out after his own ability. Moses did not look at the situation around him and say, "I think it's time to go get the children of Israel." No, he heard the voice and then he acted on THE VOICE OF GOD THAT HE HEARD. SEE, he was able to place his faith and rest his faith upon the voice THAT TOLD HIM, "GO DELIVER my children and I'll be with you." Come on, church. And when he said he would be with you, even in you, till the end of the world, don't you realize that you don't have to be no more afraid than Moses was? YOU CAN GO RIGHT into Pharaoh's house and you can take everything the devil stole from you. Come on, church. This is not a time to be scared. THIS IS NOT A TIME TO BE FEARFUL, BUT IT'S A TIME TO RAISE UP LIKE JOSHUA AND GO AHEAD AND LEAD THE ARMY OF THE LORD AND SAY WHAT A PROPHET SAID. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. We have we have we have a a belief. We have a faith and it can rest in the word of the hour. &gt;&gt; Why? Because it is the voice of God to you and me. Do you believe that here tonight? Do you believe that? The voice of God. Amen. I want I want to take you just a little farther. The voice of God in the bush, Moses heard it. And then when Moses spoke, Moses was then the voice of God to the people. Why? Because he WAS SAYING WHAT THE word told him to say. And when brother Brandon would stand there, he would say, "I'm waiting on him." And then when he would speak, HE COULD SPEAK WHAT GOD SAID. AND THAT WAS THE VOICE OF GOD TO YOU. AND NOW I want you to notice something. When the word comes into the bride, &gt;&gt; come on, somebody. The bride can then speak the word. Brothers would say it like this. He said, "THEN YOU ARE THE FINAL VOICE to the final age." I know I've quoted THAT QUITE A FEW TIMES, BUT I WANT YOU TO NOTICE SOMETHING. IT'S NOT YOUR words that are the voice of God. It is his words that you're speaking that is the voice of God. It came through a prophet AND NOW THE BRIDE WILL SAY WHAT A PROPHET SAID. &gt;&gt; I want you to notice that's how we put faith in the ministry of this hour. It is not in the man. It is not in the human being in the pulpit. It's six foot of dirt standing in the pulpit. But if THEY'RE SAYING WHAT A PROPHET SAID, THEN WE CAN PUT FAITH IN THE WORD, not in the man. &gt;&gt; Are you still with me here tonight? Amen. I I want you to we PUT FAITH IN THE human as they stay with the word. When you put faith When you PUT FAITH IN YOUR WIFE, it's because you took a vow. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And sickness and health and poverty and riches and all these wonderful things. You take a vow and you have faith that they will keep their vow. &gt;&gt; You have faith in your pastor. He's going to say what a prophet said. &gt;&gt; You have faith that you're listen. That's the faith. That's the only faith you can have in humanity is that they WILL FOLLOW CHRIST. BUT THEY COULD LET YOU DOWN. They could fail you. Moses could even fail the people. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He sure did. &gt;&gt; But when Moses failed, listen, &gt;&gt; brother Brandon, I love how he said he said he brother Brandham talked about he said he went up on the mountain there and he said God packed his body away with angels. You know, I I I I don't want to I don't want to emphasize Moses's mistakes because he was God's man for the hour. &gt;&gt; But then there was someone that would come behind him, which was a Joshua generation. You realize that Moses was only raised up to get the people to where they were. God knew exactly where Moses would start and end. &gt;&gt; But then he would have a people ready to go on over. &gt;&gt; I hope you're with me here tonight. This is this is just kind of where I've been thinking on lately. Amen. The people had to get ready under the message of Moses, but then they had to speak when they went up against the giants. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? You've got to USE YOUR VOICE. YOU'VE got to walk around. You got to march around them walls. AND YOU'VE GOT TO ACTUALLY GET INTO ACTION. COME ON, CHURCH. It's not going to be any good if you sit there on the other side OF JORDAN AND SAY, "I BELIEVE THE MESSAGE. I BELIEVE THE MESSAGE." YOU'VE GOT TO GET INTO ACTION AND PUT YOUR FAITH INTO action &gt;&gt; because the Bible says faith without works is dead. &gt;&gt; So you say, "I have faith in the word. I have faith in the word." Then you've got to put the faith that you have in this word into action. &gt;&gt; Amen. This faith was not called just to be the faith was not called faith was not given to you just to say I've got faith. What good would it a man that's got cancer or a woman that's got cancer what good would it do if they had all the faith in the world &gt;&gt; and they didn't use it &gt;&gt; sit there and die with cancer. I'm not saying that a person that dies with cancer or has cancer for that matter doesn't have faith. I I believe Job had faith. Job never lost his testimony in the midst of everything he went through. Amen. Sometimes it's just it's God's timing. It's always God's timing. Amen. So I I don't say that a person that's sick doesn't have faith. But I want you to notice why would God give you faith and then sit there and say, "Well, well, I gave you I've given you faith and you've got faith. You you you've placed it in the word, but now you're not going to get healed." No. If you've got faith, then you can speak and go forward. &gt;&gt; If you've really got faith, then you can go ahead and say, "GIVE ME MY MOUNTAIN." If you've got faith, you can rise up and say, "You know what? Greater is he that is in me than the cancer. IF YOU'VE REALLY GOT FAITH in the word, then you can go back and point to the word just like Jesus did. He defeated Satan with what? The word. And brother Random said he was showing you that the weakest of Christians could take this word and defeat Satan any place, any time, ON ANY CONDITION. I WANT YOU TO KNOW TONIGHT THAT YOU ARE A POWERFUL PEOPLE. NOT BY YOUR OWN POWER, BUT BY THE WORD THAT IS NIGH THEE, EVEN IN your mouth. Oh, thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; So, the word that is in you is greater than the enemy. &gt;&gt; Satan believes the word, but the word has not become one with Satan because he is Satan. He is the devil. He is cast out from heaven. He He can't be saved. There's there's nothing about him that he he believes it from his he can sit there and say that's right and this is right. Satan believes everything. He believes everything to be right. He knows brother Brandon was a prophet more than Listen, Satan has better revelation than most people in the world do. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Satan knows that brother Brandon was sent and was called to be a prophet of God. That's why he stood there and tormented him every night when he was on the platform. That's why he would put somebody in the congregation and and and brother Brand would be have to fight them spirits. Come on, church. You realize Satan believes and trembles. HE KNOWS IT'S RIGHT, BUT HE ALSO KNOWS HIS destination is not. Come on, church. He wants to take SOMEBODY WITH HIM. HE WANTS TO MAKE YOU DOUBT. HE WANTS TO TAKE YOU OUT OF THE WORD. AND WHAT HE WANTS YOU TO DO FIRST IS START just disbelieving one little word. And if he can do that, then he CAN GET YOUR FAITH SHAKEN. Because when you when you get off the word, your faith then is shaken because you've gotten off of the rock of revelation. &gt;&gt; But if you'll stay with the word that you that you've BEEN GIVEN, IT DON'T MATTER IF YOU UNDERSTAND IT. Believe it anyway. &gt;&gt; I'm sure the disciples didn't understand every parable that Jesus spoke right away. Amen. But they believed it. Why? Because they had a revelation. Especially Peter, he had a revelation of who Jesus was. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; And then when he was converted, he could strengthen his brethren. I want you to know here tonight, church. I I I'm not trying to I I'm not trying to I'm not trying to uh preach at you or anything. I just I I want us to take this personal tonight that we need to apply our faith to our situations. If you're sick, you need to start using your faith. I believe most of us in the building probably have more faith than what you even know. I believe those that are homesick and listening in tonight. Amen. I I believe you've got more faith than what you think you have. Because in the midst of your trial, that faith is going to raise up on the INSIDE OF YOU. YOU MAY NOT FEEL FAITH, BUT IT'S THERE. WHY? Because you come to church week in and week out and you feed on the WORD OF GOD. AND faith cometh by hearing and hearing. Come on, church. I hope you're with me now. You say, "I don't have any faith." and start hearing THE WORD OF GOD. DON'T JUST LET IT COME OFF. DON'T JUST LEAVE IT on the page. Don't just LEAVE IT ON THE TAPE, BUT APPLY IT IN YOUR HEART AND YOU CAN HAVE HEART FAITH. AND THAT'S WHERE THAT FAITH CAN REST IS ON the revelation that you have heard. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham goes on like this and I am almost out of time so just give me a few minutes and I'll I'll bring this to a close. He said now he said no matter how much faith you've got, [snorts] if you won't use it, it's no good to you. He said, "What good is a God of Moses if he ain't the same God today?" &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; He said, "What good?" He said, "What good is a historical God? You people go to church and your church only teaches that some historical fact about the Holy Ghost coming back on the day of Pentecost. There is no such a thing today. There was healing back there." He said, "What good does that do you?" No. He said, "Just no more than reading George Washington once lived." That's right. Abraham Lincoln once lived. According to the the history, Abraham Lincoln lived. And according to history, George Washington lived, but they're dead and buried according to history. &gt;&gt; And so our message, if it was just to tell you ABOUT A JESUS THAT WAS, would just be a dead letter. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, Jesus was." Okay, good. That's good. You know your history. &gt;&gt; Paul lived and Paul saw a light. Good. You know your history. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; But the message followed. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; God sent a prophet. Good. That's a first step. But that's not what you need to know. &gt;&gt; You've got to know THAT THE SAME GOD THAT WAS WITH THE PROPHET IS IN THE BRIDE. &gt;&gt; Because if YOU TAKE HIM OUT OF THE BRIDE, THEN WHAT THE PROPHET CAME TO DO, come on, church. YOU MAKE THE ENTIRE MESSAGE USELESS IF YOU DON'T PUT THE MESSAGE IN THE BRIDE. BECAUSE HE CAME TO CALL OUT A BRIDE. &gt;&gt; We see if you take the if you take the bride away from this whole thing, the message didn't even come to do anything. Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; There had to be a people believe it. If Moses would have come and went DOWN INTO EGYPT AND TOLD THE PEOPLE WHAT GOD TOLD HIM AND then he left without him. &gt;&gt; Do you realize that they would have been in vain? God wouldn't have even went to Moses. BUT GOD CAME TO A PROPHET TO SHOW you that you were the bride. And then when you see that you're the bride, you are called out and YOU ARE SET ASIDE AND YOU REALIZE, I'M NO longer just a church member. I'm no longer just another uh Holy GHOST FILILLED CHRISTIAN, BUT I AM A believer in the end time message and I've been adopted INTO THE KINGDOM OF GOD. I KNOW WHO I AM BY THE REVELATION OF THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. &gt;&gt; AND UPON THAT REVELATION, MY FAITH CANNOT BE SHAKEN. MY FAITH CANNOT BE MOVED. NOT NO DEVIL IN HELL CAN TAKE THIS REVELATION FROM ME BECAUSE I'M NOT SEEING IT THROUGH MY MIND. I'M SEEING IT BY THE VINDICATED MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. &gt;&gt; Are you still with me here tonight? Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. God doesn't want you to be He doesn't want you to be scared. &gt;&gt; He doesn't want you to be fearful. He didn't say follow Moses. Sometimes follow Moses. But but you know when he strikes that rock instead of speaks to it, uh you just have to just edit that part out of the message. No, sir. They followed Moses anyway. &gt;&gt; God will deal with Moses over his mistakes. You follow the prophet anyway. &gt;&gt; Are you still with me now? Moses didn't go say, "Well, Moses Moses made so many mistakes, you know, we just can't follow THAT MESSAGE." NO. GOD TOOK A MAN FULL of mistakes and used him as the messenger to that age. &gt;&gt; Are you still with me? I WANT YOU TO LOOK PAST THE MAN and his mistakes because all men make mistakes. &gt;&gt; But the word, there's no mistake in it. &gt;&gt; THE MESSAGE IS NOT FULL OF MISTAKES. &gt;&gt; You can look at the man and say, "Well, you know, he had nervousness and he and he fought all these THINGS UP UNTIL THE TIME HE DIED." AMEN. BUT BUT BUT I'M NOT LOOKING AT THAT. I'M LOOKING AT A MAN THAT COULD STAND THERE AND YIELD HIS BODY SO MUCH TO THE HOLY GHOST, THEN it wasn't him speaking. IT WAS GOD SPEAKING TO THIS GENERATION. AND IF GOD IS SPEAKING TO THIS GENERATION, IT'S THERE'S GOT TO BE A people that are ready to hear the voice of God that has been spoken. Come on, church. Don't let the letter just come and BE ON THE PAGE. DON'T LET THE LETTER JUST COME. DON'T LET THE VOICE just come and just BE ON A TAPE, BUT TAKE THAT INTO YOUR HEART AND SPEAK THE WORD, AND GOD WILL BACK IT UP. Thank you all. &gt;&gt; Are you with me here tonight? Brother Brandham says it like this. I love this quote just before I close. He said, he said, "You try to apply it." He He said, he said, "I we need real faith in men who dare to put God's word to their heart and apply it to themselves. You try to apply it to the generation gone by. But the Bible says that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. He's forever God. He never fails. He's the same in principle. He's the same in power. He's the same tonight that he was when he walked on the banks of Galilee. and he appears nightly on this platform and proves himself alive from the dead. He said now you don't have to take any his history about it. It's right now present time fact we see it. Come on church. That was in 1955. Brother Brandham made that bold statement that right there on the platform you could see the same Jesus Christ in action again. And brother Brandham would go on like this. He said and this was a long one so I'm going to try to get down here where I highlighted it. He said now he said he said now the same word. He said he had he had the word and he said whatsoever you ask in my name I'll do that. That's right. He said he defeated the devil on the word of God. The devil come to him and said now you do a miracle before me I hear you're going to be a miracle worker. You do something before me that and he said that devil still lives. Turn these stones into bread and eat and I'll believe you. Jesus said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God. He said now that's where his faith was anchored. And there's where every man and woman's faith tonight ought to be anchored tonight is upon the living word of God. You believe that? You can put it into action. Are you still with me here tonight? He said, "Now Jesus, when he was here on earth, he said, "Verily, I say unto you, I can do nothing in myself. I'm the son. I can do nothing, but what the father shows me that I do." Are you hearing me here tonight? He said, "I come to do the will of God." And when he went away, he said, "This ministry shall not cease now. For the very things that I do, you will do also." &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? For I will be with you, even in you to the end of the world. And this will be a sign. He said, "The very things that I do shall you do to the end of the world." He There'll be people that will not see me no more, but you shall see me, for I'll be with you, even in you to the end of the time. Jesus Christ is raised from the dead tonight. Can you say amen? And brother Brandon was going like this. He said, "Now the heroes of the Old Testament had faith. They put it in action. You've got them for an example. Now we've got faith, but you won't put it into action right away with the powers of the Holy Spirit." I say tonight as the musicians come, I mean, it's time we lift him up out of history and take the God that was and make him the God that it is tonight. AMEN. IT'S NOT A GOD that I was, but it's A GOD THAT I AM. AMEN. HE'S A PRESENT TENSE GOD. HE'S A GOD THAT IS HERE IN A TIME OF TROUBLE. HE'S A GOD THAT IS RAISED up and he's raised the dead before and he'll always come on church. Amen. If you're dead in sin and trespasses, he can raise YOU UP EVEN HERE TONIGHT. AMEN. GOD DID NOT LEAVE YOU COMFORTLESS. BUT HE SENT HIS SPIRIT TO RAISE you up and make you what you ought to be. I say here tonight, there ought to be men and women that say, you know, the devil's come and he's knocked at my door, but I'm going to raise up and say, God, I mean, I I'm your property. Amen. Satan has no business here. Amen. Faith has taken a hold and faith is going to finish what it started. Come on, church. I HAVE A REVELATION. I KNOW WHO I AM NOW. I AM THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. AND I'VE BEEN CALLED AND ORDAINED FOR A MOMENT LIKE THIS TO overcome every tempter and every one of his tricks. Are you with me here tonight, church? I don't want you to think, Amen, and leave this service and think, well, Monday morning's coming and and Satan's going to be there to meet me. Yes, he will. But greater is he that is in you. PUT YOUR FAITH IN ACTION ON MONDAY MORNING. PUT YOUR FAITH IN ACTION ON TUESDAY MORNING. PUT YOUR FAITH IN ACTION ON WEDNESDAY MORNING. AMEN. WHEN YOU COME BACK TO THE HOUSE OF GOD, DON'T COME BACK TO THE HOUSE OF GOD THINKING, "WELL, I HOPE I HAVE A BREAKTHROUGH TONIGHT." COME BACK EXPECTING A BREAKTHROUGH IN THE HOUSE OF GOD. &gt;&gt; What is it?
