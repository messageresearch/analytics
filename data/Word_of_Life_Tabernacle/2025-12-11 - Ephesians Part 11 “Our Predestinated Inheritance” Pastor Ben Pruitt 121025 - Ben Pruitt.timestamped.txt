[36:16] Falling in love
[36:19] with Jesus.
[36:23] Oh, yes. Falling in love
[36:27] with Jesus.
[36:31] The best thing I've ever
[36:35] done.
[36:37] Let's bow our heads together for a word
[36:38] of prayer. Heavenly Father, so grateful
[36:42] for your love tonight.
[36:45] So thankful that you reached down for
[36:48] us,
[36:50] Lord. And I'm thankful that after all of
[36:52] these years, it still brings tears to my
[36:54] eyes. And
[36:56] Lord, an emotion to my heart to know
[36:58] that you love me. Though I was
[37:02] unlovable, Lord, and all of us were, but
[37:06] Lord, you loved us anyway. We're so
[37:09] thankful for that love. I pray that you
[37:12] just come tonight and express yourself
[37:14] to your people through your word. Lord,
[37:17] where those that are sick and couldn't
[37:18] be here tonight, I pray that you go
[37:20] through the streaming, Lord, at the
[37:23] they're still hearing your word. And I
[37:25] pray that your presence would be right
[37:27] there where they're at. Lord, for those
[37:29] of us here, I maybe there'd be a sick
[37:31] one among us. I pray that you'd heal
[37:33] everyone. We thank you for for doing it,
[37:36] Lord. and we come and ask you to Lord
[37:39] just move me out of the way and speak
[37:41] words of life to your people. We pray in
[37:45] Jesus' name. Amen.
[37:48] Thank you Lord Jesus.
[37:52] Amen. Ephesians chapter 1, we're going
[37:54] to go verses 11 through 14. Then we'll
[37:57] read down through the end of the
[37:58] chapter. We're going to finish chapter 1
[38:00] tonight, the Lord willing. And we'll
[38:03] read 11 through 14. I was going to tell
[38:06] on brother Joel if he hadn't told on
[38:07] himself. He's up here singing with
[38:10] pneumonia. At least that's what the
[38:11] doctors say and but uh we believe in the
[38:15] great physicians a healer and brother
[38:17] Joel's going this weekend to preach at
[38:20] Van Beern Arkansas for a little church
[38:22] over there and he didn't know whether to
[38:25] go or not. And and uh because him not
[38:28] being here and I'm not going to be here
[38:29] this weekend. um be away preaching at
[38:31] Galina and um but it's a little church.
[38:35] They don't get to bring in a special
[38:37] speaker very often and so it's a great
[38:39] privilege for them to have brother Joel
[38:42] and and Joel's been so uh dedicated here
[38:45] and faithful. Would you just pray for
[38:47] Brother Joel this weekend that he'll be
[38:48] able to preach to those people and and
[38:51] uh be a help to that little church over
[38:53] there? Would you do that? And uh because
[38:55] it's not easy to uh continue to preach
[38:58] and and do what we do uh with when
[39:01] you're sick and because you use your
[39:02] body. God uses our bodies to preach. And
[39:05] so we'll just be praying for brother
[39:07] Joel that he'll be completely well by
[39:08] Saturday night when he preaches over in
[39:10] Van Beurren. And just be praying for him
[39:13] and for us as we travel as well. Going
[39:14] to be a lot of people traveling this
[39:16] weekend. So we won't have two services
[39:18] on Sunday. We'll just have Sunday
[39:19] morning service. It'll give all of you a
[39:22] little bit of a break as well. But it'll
[39:24] be Sunday morning. Brother Stewart will
[39:26] be here on Sunday morning. He's making a
[39:28] sacrifice to be here as well when he
[39:30] could be with his family. They're going
[39:32] to be uh gone, I believe. But but he
[39:35] made a sacrifice to stay as well. And so
[39:37] I'm thankful for these men of God that
[39:39] he's allowed me to serve with and and I
[39:42] hope that we all appreciate the
[39:44] sacrifice that it is to be and to do to
[39:47] be a minister in this age. I'd much
[39:48] rather sit there with you, but God has
[39:50] called me to do it and God has called
[39:52] these men to do it. And so let's just do
[39:53] it with all of our hearts and just
[39:55] believe the Lord will help us in our
[39:58] failures and our frailty of humanity.
[40:01] Ephesians chapter 1 11
[40:04] says, "In whom also we have obtained an
[40:08] inheritance,
[40:09] being predestinated according to the
[40:11] purpose of him who workketh all things
[40:14] after the counsel of his own will, that
[40:19] we should be to the praise of his glory,
[40:21] who first trusted in Christ, in whom you
[40:25] also trusted after that you heard the
[40:27] word of truth, the gospel of your
[40:30] salvation, in whom Also, after that you
[40:32] believed, you were sealed with that Holy
[40:34] Spirit of promise, which is the earnest
[40:37] of our inheritance until the redemption
[40:40] of the purchased possession unto the
[40:43] praise of his glory. I pray the Lord
[40:45] would add his blessing to the word. You
[40:47] may be seated. I was also going to
[40:49] mention that uh next Wednesday night,
[40:51] Brother Timothy Puit will be here with
[40:53] us. So, we'll be looking forward to
[40:55] that. Hearing brother Timothy again,
[40:56] it's been a while since he's been here.
[40:58] I will be here as well, but brother
[41:00] Timothy is going to be passing through,
[41:02] so I ask him to speak on Wednesday
[41:04] night. I want to ask us a question
[41:06] tonight. If you could change your lot in
[41:10] life, and your lot in life is everything
[41:13] about yourself, your past, your
[41:16] mistakes, your successes, and your
[41:19] failures. And if you could trade that
[41:21] with anyone else in the world, would you
[41:24] do it? Now, I want you to think deeply
[41:27] about that for just a moment because the
[41:30] the the answer may uh it may be
[41:34] determined by how well we understand
[41:36] what we've been studying in Ephesians
[41:39] chapter 1. Because what Paul does in
[41:42] Ephesians chapter 1 is he's taking
[41:44] chance out of the equation. He's saying
[41:47] you're not who you are spiritually or
[41:51] even naturally by chance. A and you're
[41:54] also not who you are by human
[41:57] manipulation.
[41:59] Now, I know that's hard to believe
[42:00] because we come uh we we want to uh look
[42:03] at our lives and think, well, I am what
[42:05] I am because so and so did this and so
[42:07] and so did that. And that's true. But if
[42:11] you have an all powerful God who
[42:14] controls everything and knows every uh
[42:17] every uh flea that that that falls to
[42:20] the ground, every bird that falls to the
[42:21] ground, every flea, brother Bram said,
[42:23] how much tallow it would make. He knows
[42:26] every every bird, every flower, he knows
[42:29] every hair that's ever been on your
[42:30] head. He knows all about that. and and
[42:33] you believe that in that kind of a God,
[42:36] then everything he does or doesn't do
[42:38] matters in life. And so if he if he
[42:41] withheld uh you know, maybe he you you
[42:44] got sick and and it changed your life in
[42:47] in some way that you had some sickness
[42:49] that you carried through life or maybe
[42:51] you had a background of a certain way.
[42:53] you were born under a cloud. Maybe
[42:56] certain parents that or that maybe
[42:59] weren't even married or something and
[43:01] and or maybe they were married but they
[43:03] treated you in a certain way that you
[43:05] say, "Well, I wish I had different
[43:07] parents. I wish I'd been born in a in a
[43:09] different way. I wish I'd have been born
[43:12] without that cloud hanging over me." And
[43:14] yet at the same time we recognize that
[43:16] when we understand Ephesians chapter 1,
[43:20] then what we are is the only thing that
[43:22] we could be.
[43:24] &gt;&gt; Right? And that God has made us what we
[43:26] are and he's called us to be what we
[43:29] are. And so we remove chance from the
[43:31] equation. We remove human manipulation
[43:35] from the equation. And Paul says you are
[43:38] the elected of God, the predestinated of
[43:41] God. You were in the mind of God before
[43:43] the foundation of the earth. And so we
[43:46] you have an inheritance in him. And that
[43:49] word inheritance is literally to appoint
[43:52] by lot to assign to a category or a
[43:56] group based on the result of something
[43:59] which cannot be temporarily controlled.
[44:02] Right? Which cannot be temporarily
[44:05] controlled. How many know what casting
[44:08] lots is
[44:10] &gt;&gt; in the Bible? They would cast lots. And
[44:12] you've heard the uh expression, well, I
[44:15] drew the short straw. And we've heard
[44:17] that expression. Well, that's what lots
[44:19] are. They would take a certain number of
[44:21] sticks, however many people that there
[44:23] were, one of the sticks would be shorter
[44:25] than all the rest. And so, each one
[44:27] would draw a stick, and the one who drew
[44:29] the short stick would be the one that
[44:31] something bad happened to,
[44:33] &gt;&gt; right? And that's casting lots. And we
[44:36] know that in the Old Testament that God
[44:38] even expressed his will through the lot.
[44:42] &gt;&gt; Did you know that? In fact, the land was
[44:45] first divided by lot. Joshua, he
[44:50] actually had the land divided. So Judah
[44:52] got the exact location of their land,
[44:55] not by human manipulation, not by Joshua
[44:58] saying, "Well, Judah would would be good
[45:00] over here." and not by uh not by chance
[45:04] but by lot which was influenced by God.
[45:09] &gt;&gt; Right? So even the seemingly chance
[45:11] things that happen in our lives are
[45:13] influenced by an all powerful God who
[45:17] knows everything about us.
[45:19] &gt;&gt; And so there's no room for self-pity in
[45:22] that is there. There there's no room for
[45:24] that. You know that's the devil's
[45:26] favorite kind of party. maybe right next
[45:28] to the Christmas party, you know, for
[45:30] some people. But but the devil's
[45:32] favorite kind of party is actually a
[45:34] pity party,
[45:36] &gt;&gt; right? He loves a pity party because he
[45:39] I know some of you are looking at me
[45:40] like, "Brother Ben, you don't understand
[45:42] how I was raised or or what I've been
[45:44] through. How could you say?" But see,
[45:46] God allowed you to go through what you
[45:48] went through. And and God allowed you to
[45:50] be raised the way you were raised
[45:52] because it may have been the only way
[45:53] that he could produce the kind of
[45:55] character that you have today. And so we
[45:57] we can't have a pity party about who we
[45:59] are, who our parents were. We can't hate
[46:02] people because maybe the Lord told him
[46:04] to do it. Maybe he withheld his hand
[46:06] just enough that they would do what they
[46:08] did.
[46:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on, church.
[46:12] &gt;&gt; Our God is bigger than what we think he
[46:15] is.
[46:15] &gt;&gt; HE CONTROLS MORE THAN WHAT WE THINK he
[46:18] controls. HE HAS MUCH MORE POWER than
[46:21] what we think he does.
[46:22] &gt;&gt; Right.
[46:24] &gt;&gt; True. Good.
[46:24] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[46:26] I know we don't understand that, but
[46:28] it's important. I say we I think we
[46:31] understand the concept,
[46:33] &gt;&gt; but do we buy it?
[46:35] &gt;&gt; Does that make sense? Because every time
[46:38] something bad happens, we question God.
[46:40] And Paul says, "All things work together
[46:42] for the good
[46:44] &gt;&gt; to them that love God." It didn't say
[46:46] all things were good. Right?
[46:48] &gt;&gt; Lots of bad stuff happens to good
[46:49] people,
[46:50] &gt;&gt; but all things work together for the
[46:52] good.
[46:53] &gt;&gt; So God knowing what your life would be
[46:56] and who you would be and and everything
[46:58] about you knew that in this particular
[47:00] time that that you would be in this
[47:02] particular place that you would need a
[47:04] certain thing and he controls that. He
[47:07] does not fail.
[47:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[47:10] &gt;&gt; He's never been forced to do anything.
[47:13] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[47:15] &gt;&gt; That's the kind of God we serve. And I
[47:17] we don't serve a weak God or a God who's
[47:19] controlled by circumstances. We serve a
[47:22] God who, if he is God at all, he knows
[47:25] all things.
[47:27] Are you with me now? God who created the
[47:30] heavens and the earth gave us an
[47:32] inheritance. The same way that he gave
[47:35] the children of Israel an inheritance.
[47:37] It wasn't chance for them to draw the
[47:40] lot. And today we don't draw the lot.
[47:42] Brother Brandon said in the church we
[47:43] vote. He said that's the form of drawing
[47:46] the lot in the church. So that's why he
[47:48] said if we vote on a certain thing, he
[47:50] said that becomes the will of the Lord
[47:53] &gt;&gt; because God influences the vote.
[47:56] &gt;&gt; Right?
[47:58] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. He influences the vote.
[48:00] So if a certain person is the pastor,
[48:02] you say, "Well, I don't want him to be
[48:03] the pastor." But the church voted him in
[48:05] as pastor. He said, "You get behind
[48:07] that,
[48:08] &gt;&gt; right? A certain person is the deacon."
[48:11] And maybe a certain one person didn't
[48:13] want him to be a deacon and maybe it was
[48:14] the deacon's wife, you know, and didn't
[48:16] want him to be. But but it's just
[48:18] sometimes it works that way and maybe a
[48:20] few people would vote against it, but
[48:22] they get behind the vote of the church
[48:24] because God's able to influence that.
[48:27] Are you with me so far? If he's able to
[48:29] influence the vote of the church, if
[48:31] he's able to influence the lot, the
[48:33] casting of lots in the Old Testament,
[48:35] how much more is he able to influence
[48:37] every little detail of our lives? And he
[48:40] could intervene many times, but he
[48:42] chooses not to because he knows the
[48:44] bigger picture. AND HE KNOWS MORE ABOUT
[48:46] US than what we know about ourselves.
[48:51] &gt;&gt; See, we are not just chosen,
[48:54] &gt;&gt; but we have an inheritance.
[48:57] &gt;&gt; We are chosen to have an inheritance.
[49:00] What is our inheritance? Brother Brham
[49:02] said, God before the foundation of the
[49:04] world left you something,
[49:07] &gt;&gt; a name written on the book. Hallelujah.
[49:11] That when the lamb would be slain, you'd
[49:14] be recognized with it. It's an
[49:16] inheritance. You're the heir of his
[49:19] body. If you uh leave something to your
[49:22] children, uh they they maybe you have
[49:25] two children and you leave something to
[49:26] both of them. There's a legal uh
[49:28] doctrine that says you can leave it to
[49:30] them per sturppies or per capita. Per
[49:32] capita means that if one dies, all the
[49:35] property would go to the other one.
[49:37] Purpes means that if that one dies, it
[49:39] goes to his heirs.
[49:41] &gt;&gt; So when Jesus died, it didn't go back to
[49:43] God, but the inheritance went to us.
[49:46] &gt;&gt; Right? That's what brought us the
[49:48] inheritance, but the one who gave us the
[49:50] inheritance was God before the
[49:52] foundation of the world.
[49:54] &gt;&gt; Right? Jesus didn't give us the
[49:56] inheritance. He died so it could pass to
[49:58] us, but he didn't give it to us. Now,
[50:01] now hang with me for just a moment. Now,
[50:03] brother said there was a name written on
[50:05] the book. That's what he gave you. that
[50:06] when the lamb would be slain, you'd be
[50:09] recognized with it. So this inheritance
[50:12] is by predestination. Brother said, "How
[50:14] did we get it?" Because we walked
[50:15] upright. Listen, WE COULD HAVE NEVER
[50:18] WALKED UPRIGHT unless he taught us to.
[50:21] WE COULD HAVE NEVER FOUND GOD unless he
[50:23] was looking for us. That's the only way
[50:25] we could have ever found him is if he
[50:27] came looking for me. Aren't you glad?
[50:30] Aren't you glad he can come looking for
[50:31] you tonight? WE SERVE A GOD WHO'S ABLE
[50:34] TO REACH DOWN ON A WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND
[50:36] COME LOOKING FOR A LOST SOUL. He's able
[50:40] to look for those who have a a a need
[50:43] for him. He's able to find them. Even in
[50:46] his looking, he he knows exactly where
[50:50] we are, just like he did Adam in the
[50:51] beginning. Yet, he calls out to Adam and
[50:54] Adam had to respond. But God knew that
[50:57] he would. And how he would respond.
[50:58] Look, he said, "How did we get it?"
[51:00] because we walked upright. How do we get
[51:02] this inheritance? Because we were
[51:05] predestinated.
[51:07] &gt;&gt; We That ought to take all the fear out
[51:09] of it, all the scare out of it, all the
[51:11] worry out of it. And it ought to make us
[51:14] so blessed every day. THINK GOD, YOU
[51:16] ALLOWED people to be in my life so that
[51:19] I could bless them. IF YOU GAVE ME A
[51:21] FAMILY, if you gave me a wife, IF YOU
[51:23] GAVE ME CHILDREN, IT WASN'T A MISTAKE.
[51:25] COME ON, CHURCH. It wasn't some SOME
[51:28] TOXIC MISTAKE. GOD GAVE ME MY FAMILY FOR
[51:30] A REASON. He gave me my wife for a
[51:33] reason. He let me be in this church FOR
[51:35] A REASON. I MAY NOT BE THE BEST PASTOR
[51:37] IN THE WORLD, BUT HE PUT ME HERE FOR A
[51:39] REASON. THEN LET ME HELP EVERYBODY I can
[51:41] help. LET ME DO GOOD TO EVERYBODY I CAN
[51:44] DO GOOD TO BECAUSE HE PUT ME HERE. HE'S
[51:46] GOT A PURPOSE IN me being here. I have
[51:49] an inheritance in Christ.
[51:53] &gt;&gt; Now, God gave you an inheritance.
[51:57] And the Bible says what? Brother
[51:59] Brandham said it this way. Bible says
[52:01] God gave you an inheritance. Brother
[52:02] Brandham said, "Why you say Jesus left
[52:04] you an inheritance?" He said, "I beg
[52:06] your pardon. Jesus never left me an
[52:08] inheritance. Jesus never left you an
[52:10] inheritance. He only came down and paid
[52:12] for your inheritance.
[52:14] Brought you to your inheritance. But
[52:17] your name was put on the lamb's book of
[52:19] life before the foundation of the world.
[52:21] God give you your inheritance. your
[52:24] inheritance was first.
[52:28] &gt;&gt; So that's what Paul is teaching us in
[52:30] Ephesians chapter 1. God by his
[52:32] fornowledge, seeing exactly who would be
[52:34] saved, who wouldn't be saved. He sent
[52:36] Jesus to save those that he'd already
[52:38] chosen. He said that's our inheritance.
[52:41] God chose us and let Jesus come and pay
[52:44] the price that what?
[52:46] &gt;&gt; Shedding of his blood that no sin would
[52:49] be accounted to us.
[52:52] nothing you do.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; I've had people ask me and and this is
[53:00] the answer to that. And I've told you
[53:02] before, but I've had people ask me,
[53:03] "Well, is God punishing me for doing
[53:05] this? Are you in the mind of God? Do you
[53:08] have this inheritance
[53:11] &gt;&gt; then? No sin." See, in God's mind,
[53:15] you've never been a sinner.
[53:21] I wonder if we can grab a hold of that.
[53:25] &gt;&gt; You never did it in the first place.
[53:27] &gt;&gt; JUSTIFICATION IS NOT GOD COMING and
[53:29] saying, "Okay, I I'll put up with your
[53:31] sin." It's not God saying, "Well, I'M
[53:33] GOING TO JUST I I know you did it, but
[53:35] I'll just forgive you for it." No.
[53:37] Justification is as though you never did
[53:39] it in the first place. IN THE MIND OF
[53:41] GOD, THE REAL you never did it in Oh,
[53:44] God. You you NEVER DID THOSE THINGS IN
[53:47] the first place.
[53:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. No sin would be accounted to us.
[53:54] David said, "Blessed is the man in WHOM
[53:56] THE LORD WILL NOT IMPUTE SIN, WILL NOT
[53:59] ACCOUNT SIN TO HIM."
[54:00] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[54:03] &gt;&gt; Will not account sin to him. I tell you
[54:05] this, if you ever get a revelation of
[54:07] that, you want to live as close to God
[54:08] as you can live. You want to live as
[54:10] close to the scripture as you can live
[54:12] because you want to thank God that he
[54:14] does not account sin on your on your
[54:16] account.
[54:18] &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "So then it is not of
[54:20] him that willth, nor of him that runth,
[54:22] but God that showeth mercy. Not because
[54:25] you could will YOURSELF INTO BEING A
[54:28] CHRISTIAN, NOT BECAUSE YOU COULD RUN SO
[54:30] HARD AND BE A CHRISTIAN, BUT GOD SHOWED
[54:32] MERCY TO you and he showed mercy to me.
[54:35] Aren't you glad that he did?"
[54:38] What? What is the inheritance?
[54:40] God sent Jesus to make that inheritance
[54:43] real to me because there was nothing I
[54:45] could do to inherit it. It was blank. It
[54:47] was valid. There's nothing I could do.
[54:49] But in the fullness of time, God sent.
[54:52] It was own good time. Jesus the lamb
[54:55] slain from the foundation of the world.
[54:57] His blood was shed that I might go to my
[55:00] inheritance
[55:02] to be what? What inheritance? The
[55:03] sunship to be a son of God. So, first of
[55:06] all, if you're keeping notes, he came to
[55:09] give us an inheritance of sunship.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; That's our inheritance, a name on a
[55:14] book.
[55:15] &gt;&gt; Sunship.
[55:17] So, it was more than just we're
[55:19] predestinated to adoption. So, it's more
[55:22] than just God's saying you're going to
[55:24] make it, but God's saying you're going
[55:26] to be a son,
[55:27] &gt;&gt; you're going to be a daughter,
[55:30] &gt;&gt; you're going to inherit sunship.
[55:33] Jesus came as the firstborn among many
[55:36] brethren to be one who would stand up
[55:38] and would say I am I am the first one to
[55:42] come to this position. And so he proved
[55:45] who he was when he st when he was there
[55:48] in the boat. He was human. He was
[55:49] asleep. He he was fully human and yet he
[55:52] was fully God. He was asleep in the
[55:54] boat. But he stood UP ON THE BOW OF THE
[55:56] BOAT AND HE SAID, "Peace be still." And
[55:58] when he did, what happened? The waves
[56:01] still. Right?
[56:03] They completely stopped the storm
[56:05] stopped. WHY? BECAUSE THE SON OF God
[56:10] stood on the ship and commanded nature.
[56:17] &gt;&gt; And it's the same thing that Adam did at
[56:19] the beginning.
[56:20] &gt;&gt; A son of God stood there and commanded
[56:23] nature.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[56:26] &gt;&gt; THAT IS OUR INHERITANCE.
[56:30] THAT'S WHY YOU can overcome whatever's
[56:32] going on in your body right now.
[56:33] Whatever you're dealing with right now,
[56:35] whatever addiction you might have had,
[56:37] whatever trouble you might have had, you
[56:38] say, "Well, I was addicted to uh to
[56:40] alcohol or or to lust or any kind of
[56:42] other thing." Remember, you are an
[56:44] overcomer of that. Not because of how
[56:47] much you run or or how much you will,
[56:50] but you're an overcomer because you have
[56:52] BEEN PREDESTINED TO SUNSHIP. AND AND
[56:55] SUNSHIP IS WHO THAT'S part of WHAT YOU
[56:57] ARE. IF YOU CAN YIELD YOURSELF to that
[57:00] nature, YOU DON'T HAVE TO BECOME
[57:02] SOMETHING YOU'RE NOT. YOU JUST HAVE TO
[57:04] BE WHAT YOU ARE. THAT'S THE PROBLEM. TOO
[57:06] MANY PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO GET BLOOD OUT
[57:08] OF A TURNUP. THEY'RE TRYING TO BECOME
[57:10] SOMETHING THEY'RE NOT. CHRISTIANITY IS
[57:12] NOT BECOMING SOMETHING that you're not.
[57:13] IT'S BECOMING WHAT YOU ALREADY ARE.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; The sunship.
[57:20] Jesus proved that. And he spoke to the
[57:23] fig tree as well. and and and the fig
[57:26] tree died because he commanded nature.
[57:30] And we've talked about a little bit
[57:31] about this. I won't dwell on it very
[57:32] long, but brother Brandon says, "Now the
[57:34] world in nature is groaning, crying,
[57:36] everything's moving. What for the
[57:39] manifestation of the sons of God, when
[57:42] true sons, born sons, filled sons speak,
[57:46] and their word is backed."
[57:48] &gt;&gt; Listen what he says. I believe we're on
[57:50] the border of it right now.
[57:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. say to this mountain, let it
[57:55] be so. Quoting Mark 11:23, for verily I
[57:58] say unto you, that whosoever, someone
[58:00] say that with me, whosoever
[58:02] shall say to this mountain, be thou
[58:05] removed, and be thou cast into the sea,
[58:07] and shall not doubt in his heart. Could
[58:10] we think about it like this? Election is
[58:12] the capacity to not doubt.
[58:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on. Somebody was elected and
[58:18] predestined to be a believer when others
[58:21] would doubt, BUT THEY WOULD STAND THERE
[58:22] and say, "I there's something in me.
[58:24] It's not me, but there's SOMETHING IN
[58:26] ME. I BELIEVE THE WORD OF GOD." WHAT
[58:28] MADE YOU a believer?
[58:31] &gt;&gt; Your own effort didn't make you a
[58:32] believer. You can't change your own
[58:34] mind.
[58:36] &gt;&gt; God did that.
[58:39] &gt;&gt; You can't change your heart.
[58:41] &gt;&gt; God did that.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said, he said, "The shall
[58:48] believe that those things which he saith
[58:49] shall come to pass. He shall have
[58:52] whatsoever he saith." Brother Brandon
[58:54] says, "How are you going to do it? Stand
[58:56] still." We've been talking about that
[58:58] lately. We talked about it Sunday. How
[59:00] are you going to do it? Stand still. And
[59:02] that's the part people don't get. They
[59:04] say, "Well, by effort, I'm going to
[59:05] achieve this." No. Are you going to get
[59:07] sunship? Stand still.
[59:10] God is wanting to place his church the
[59:12] sons and daughters of God. He said,
[59:14] "God, let me live to see it." It's my
[59:17] prayer so close. He said, "Till I can
[59:20] just feel it with my hands almost. LOOK
[59:22] LIKE IT'S RIGHT THERE." HE SAID, "OH,
[59:24] WAITING for the manifestation of the
[59:26] sons of God." Hallelujah. When God will
[59:28] make himself known, I like this. Some of
[59:31] you that are sick, you can grab a hold
[59:32] of this tonight. He said, "They'll stop
[59:35] sickness.
[59:37] &gt;&gt; THEY'LL STOP CANCER.
[59:39] &gt;&gt; They'll stop diseases." In fact, he said
[59:41] at the end times there would be
[59:42] diseases. He said it would look make
[59:44] cancer look like a cold.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; That's what he said. BUT HE SAID THEY'LL
[59:48] STOP IT.
[59:50] &gt;&gt; AMEN. He said that's what we're striving
[59:52] for now. To get in and be positionally
[59:54] placed into the kingdom of God before
[59:57] these horrible plagues strike. He said,
[59:58] "Oh, how good. The dispensation of time,
[1:00:01] the fullness of time, the inheritance.
[1:00:04] What is our inheritance? Our inheritance
[1:00:06] is sunship. Our inheritance is also the
[1:00:09] redemption of our body because we know
[1:00:11] full sunship comes when this body is
[1:00:14] actually redeemed. So it's not just it's
[1:00:17] not just the inner man that becomes a
[1:00:20] son or daughter of God but it's actually
[1:00:21] our entire being that becomes the son or
[1:00:24] daughter of God. It's our inheritance.
[1:00:26] Romans 8:23 he said not only they but
[1:00:29] ourselves also which have the first
[1:00:31] fruits of the spirit. Even we ourselves
[1:00:33] grown within ourselves waiting for the
[1:00:36] adoption to w the redemption of our
[1:00:40] body. The redemption of our body. This
[1:00:44] is our inheritance. This is what we're
[1:00:46] predestinated to. 2 Corinthians 5:1. For
[1:00:49] we know. I wonder how many know tonight.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; We know. Brother Bill. That's why we can
[1:00:58] have that attitude like you had with me
[1:00:59] on the phone. We know.
[1:01:03] I'M READY TO GO. PAUL SAID, "For me," he
[1:01:06] said, "to to to to live is Christ and to
[1:01:09] die is gain."
[1:01:11] Right? WE KNOW THAT IF OUR EARTHLY house
[1:01:15] of this tabernacle were dissolved,
[1:01:19] we have a building of God, a house not
[1:01:22] made with hands, eternal in the heavens.
[1:01:26] We have. He didn't say we will have
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; but we have.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; When a baby comes into birth, brother
[1:01:34] Brown explains this this way. When a
[1:01:36] baby comes into birth, there's a spirit
[1:01:38] there already prepared to enter into
[1:01:42] that body.
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; Right? Look at Matthew 18 and10.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; He says this. He said, "Take heed that
[1:01:50] you despise not one of these little
[1:01:51] ones." Right? So Jesus tells us to take
[1:01:55] special care with young children.
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; He said, "For I say unto you that in
[1:02:00] heaven, their angels do always behold
[1:02:03] the face of my father which is in
[1:02:06] heaven." So a mother, you know, before
[1:02:10] she gives birth, brother Brandon said
[1:02:12] she could be as cranky and honory as she
[1:02:15] could be, but before she gives birth,
[1:02:19] she actually gets sweet.
[1:02:22] And there's something that comes over
[1:02:24] her that she she mellows out a little
[1:02:27] bit and she gets sweet and it's a it's
[1:02:30] an influence of another from another
[1:02:32] land. And so there is a spirit that
[1:02:35] enters in to that new body, right? So
[1:02:39] when the body drops to the earth, then
[1:02:42] there's a spirit that enters into that
[1:02:44] new body. And and so brother Brandon
[1:02:48] said it's because the reason she's
[1:02:49] getting sweet is because that little
[1:02:51] angel, little spirit, he said a little
[1:02:53] messenger to this little tabernacle is
[1:02:55] ready to come forth into the world.
[1:02:57] Well, just like it works when we are
[1:02:59] born, it works when we are born again.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; Right? So when you are born again, he
[1:03:05] said the angel of the Lord comes into
[1:03:08] your body. This is what brother Brandham
[1:03:11] taught. The angel of the Lord actually
[1:03:14] comes into you. He said there's there's
[1:03:16] something a spirit that's ordained of
[1:03:18] God, he said to take this body. He said
[1:03:21] then he said when now when that natural
[1:03:23] spirit comes into a baby he said then
[1:03:26] that baby has to have a choice. It makes
[1:03:27] its decision. He said then when this
[1:03:29] takes place then you see the angel of
[1:03:31] the Lord he said now comes in here it's
[1:03:34] a spiritual body that eternal when when
[1:03:37] they make a decision when they follow
[1:03:39] Christ when they believe in Christ then
[1:03:40] there's the angel of the Lord comes in.
[1:03:42] He said, "This is this is a dying spirit
[1:03:46] in a dying body."
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; He said, "And you can't be in two bodies
[1:03:50] at one time." So, not everybody's going
[1:03:52] to heaven. That's not what we're
[1:03:53] preaching. But there is a spirit
[1:03:55] prepared to take everybody,
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; And and we don't take human life. You do
[1:04:02] realize all babies go to heaven, right?
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; Right. We don't take human life lightly.
[1:04:11] Uh it's the strongest case that we have
[1:04:13] uh against abortion and against uh
[1:04:16] infanticide and killing babies,
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; right? Because because there's a God,
[1:04:23] they're made in the image of God.
[1:04:24] There's something that God has a spirit
[1:04:26] he puts in that baby,
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; right? But that don't mean it's born
[1:04:30] again. Brother said it's a dying spirit
[1:04:32] and a dying body.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; He said, "Now you can't be in two bodies
[1:04:36] at one time, but there can be two
[1:04:38] natures in you at one time." Come on.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; When you're born again, you're not born
[1:04:42] physical like the baby was, but what's
[1:04:44] happened? The spiritual birth has come
[1:04:45] to you. And while this spiritual birth
[1:04:47] is growing into your heart of God,
[1:04:50] hallelujah.
[1:04:52] Now, now watch. You started off a new
[1:04:54] Christian. You were a new baby and you
[1:04:57] desired the sincere milk of the word and
[1:04:59] you just knew a little bit about the
[1:05:00] word and you you just loved the Lord,
[1:05:02] but you were a baby Christian, right?
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; Well, there was a word body growing.
[1:05:12] He that's what he said when this
[1:05:15] spiritual birth is growing your heart of
[1:05:17] God there's a physical or celestial body
[1:05:18] growing he said to receive that spirit.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; So what happens when a person dies as a
[1:05:25] Christian is that that that word body
[1:05:28] has grown to receive
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; that spirit
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; that's been born again.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:05:38] that was in God from the beginning.
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; He said, and when he said this life, the
[1:05:44] life leaves this body, he said it goes
[1:05:46] to that body. Just as when the body is
[1:05:48] presented to the earth, the spirit comes
[1:05:49] in. And when the spirit goes out of the
[1:05:51] body, there's a body waiting. For we
[1:05:53] know after this earthly tabernacle be
[1:05:55] dissolved, we have one already waiting.
[1:05:57] See, that's it. The spiritual body of
[1:05:59] the people. See, he was the word. Now,
[1:06:03] Christ was the word from the beginning.
[1:06:05] How many know that? I know this is deep,
[1:06:07] but you can go come back and listen to
[1:06:08] it, study the message, and we're kind of
[1:06:11] moving fast because we just want to see
[1:06:12] what our inheritance is. But he was the
[1:06:15] word from the beginning, but we bypassed
[1:06:18] our theophony. So, he come from the
[1:06:20] attribute to word to flesh, back to
[1:06:25] word, and then took a glorified body.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; Right? We came from attribute,
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; right? We were an attribute of God.
[1:06:36] But we bypassed our theophony,
[1:06:39] our word body, and came to flesh, NOT
[1:06:42] KNOWING WHO WE WERE.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; BUT HE KNEW ALL THE TIME.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; Put in a chicken pin, as it were, an
[1:06:51] eagle in a chicken pin.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; But he knew who he what we were
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; and where we were. So we were we we
[1:06:59] bypassed our theophony and become flesh
[1:07:02] man to be tempted by sin. And then if
[1:07:04] this earthly TABERNACLE IS DISSOLVED, WE
[1:07:07] HAVE ONE ALREADY WAITING.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; He said, "We have not yet the bodies."
[1:07:10] He said, "When this body receives the
[1:07:12] spirit of God, though the immortal life
[1:07:14] inside of you throws this body in
[1:07:16] subjection to God,
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; right? This body mortal cannot inherit
[1:07:21] immortality. This body will not be saved
[1:07:24] if you can put it like that. It has to
[1:07:26] be changed a and it has to be renewed.
[1:07:29] It had to be made new in order to go
[1:07:31] into heaven." Even a glorified body is
[1:07:34] not just this body. It's this body
[1:07:36] glorified
[1:07:38] in its perfect condition. But he said we
[1:07:41] have not. He said the the immortal life
[1:07:44] inside of you throws this body, this
[1:07:46] flesh body, this sinful body in
[1:07:49] subjection to God. Now, I hope you're
[1:07:51] hearing me. A person say, "Well, I I can
[1:07:54] do whatever I want. I can go out and
[1:07:56] live with women and and run around on
[1:07:58] the streets and drink alcohol and and do
[1:08:00] whatever I want. Smoke and drink and
[1:08:02] carry on. I'm predestined of God. No,
[1:08:05] that's not how it works. Because what
[1:08:07] happens is if you had the spirit of God
[1:08:10] in you,
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; you might be predestined, but you're not
[1:08:13] born yet.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; Because if you were born, another nature
[1:08:16] would have come into you. And that
[1:08:19] nature to come into you would be greater
[1:08:20] than the nature of the flesh. Yeah.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; And it would take uh precedence over the
[1:08:26] flesh. It would it would begin to
[1:08:28] dominate the flesh. Oh my. And throw
[1:08:31] that body in subjection to God. He said,
[1:08:33] "You don't have to say, "Oh, if I could
[1:08:35] just quit drinking. IF I COULD JUST JUST
[1:08:37] GET IN CHRIST and it's all gone."
[1:08:39] Because your body is subject to the
[1:08:41] spirit. It's no more subject to the
[1:08:43] things of the world. They're dead. So
[1:08:45] you see a person that's living in sin
[1:08:47] claiming to be predestined. I know
[1:08:49] that's a great stumbling block to
[1:08:50] people. It's the greatest argument the
[1:08:52] devil has. Well, predestination must not
[1:08:54] be real. Election must not be real. Cuz
[1:08:56] some people live in sin claiming to be
[1:08:58] Christians, but they're just never been
[1:08:59] born again yet. If they live that way
[1:09:02] constantly, it just means that they need
[1:09:04] a new birth. And if they're a candidate
[1:09:06] for a new birth, God knows the PLACE AND
[1:09:09] THE TIME THEY'LL BE BORN IN.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; So,
[1:09:18] your body is subject to the spirit.
[1:09:19] somewhere subject to the things of the
[1:09:20] world. They're dead. They're dead. Your
[1:09:21] sins are buried in baptism and you're a
[1:09:24] new creation in Christ and your body
[1:09:26] becomes subject to the spirit. He said,
[1:09:27] "Try to live the right kind of life."
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; So, you'll always have a sticky nature,
[1:09:32] but it's subject.
[1:09:34] That means if you would do something
[1:09:35] wrong or say something wrong,
[1:09:36] inadvertently, you would do something
[1:09:38] that would be wrong. And maybe you get
[1:09:41] angry at somebody, you start to build up
[1:09:43] that bitterness and suddenly the Holy
[1:09:45] Spirit, that nature inside of you
[1:09:46] convicts you of that. Quickly you
[1:09:48] repent.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; Quickly you repent. Why? Because there's
[1:09:53] something in you that that's correcting
[1:09:56] you that's bringing you closer to that
[1:09:58] other body.
[1:10:00] Now to that word body. So Paul describes
[1:10:03] it like this. He said in whom you also
[1:10:05] trusted after that you heard the word of
[1:10:07] truth the gospel of your salvation. And
[1:10:09] whom also after that you believed you
[1:10:11] were sealed with that holy spirit of
[1:10:12] promise. He said, "What was the
[1:10:14] salvation?" He was trying to tell them,
[1:10:15] "Predestined before the foundation of
[1:10:17] little earth to adoption of sons,
[1:10:19] predestinated to eternal life." He said,
[1:10:21] "No, after you come into eternal life,
[1:10:23] after you've been saved, sanctified,
[1:10:25] filled with the Holy Spirit, you're
[1:10:27] sons."
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; Now, God's wanting to place you
[1:10:30] positionally so that you can work for
[1:10:33] his kingdom and his glory.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; So, the seal here is the seal of our
[1:10:37] faith. I don't have time to get into it
[1:10:39] tonight, but brother Brown uses the box
[1:10:41] car an analogy early in his ministry. He
[1:10:44] talks about how that there's a a
[1:10:46] inspector that would come to a box car
[1:10:48] and seal it up. He said when
[1:10:50] everything's in order and in place, he
[1:10:52] said he seals it. But later on, brother
[1:10:54] Brandham always goes back to Abraham and
[1:10:56] he says it's a seal of faith.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; So what he's sealing up is actually our
[1:11:01] faith. Cuz we might have some things in
[1:11:04] our life or our bodies that are out of
[1:11:05] order. God still give us the Holy Ghost
[1:11:08] because he's sealing our faith.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; Right. Otherwise, you'd have to live a
[1:11:14] perfect and then get the Holy Ghost.
[1:11:16] Well, you can't live that way without
[1:11:18] the Holy Ghost.
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; But it's a seal of faith just like
[1:11:21] Abraham. And and so Paul goes on, he
[1:11:24] said, "Which is the earnest of our
[1:11:26] inheritance."
[1:11:27] So the Holy Ghost that you receive is
[1:11:30] the down payment of our inheritance
[1:11:32] until the redemption of the purchased
[1:11:34] possession unto the praise of his glory.
[1:11:37] That word earnest is the purchase money,
[1:11:39] the property given in advance as
[1:11:42] security for the rest.
[1:11:45] God didn't demand a down payment of you.
[1:11:48] I hope you're hearing this tonight. He
[1:11:51] didn't come to you and say, "I'll save
[1:11:52] you, but you got to give me a down
[1:11:53] payment."
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; That's not what he said.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; He wasn't selling. He was buying.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; No,
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; HE'S THE BUYER IN THE TRANSACTION. HE
[1:12:03] WASN'T SELLING. HE SAID, "I'M I'm going
[1:12:05] to come and and buy you. I'm going to
[1:12:07] purchase you and I'm GOING TO GIVE YOU A
[1:12:08] DOWN PAYMENT
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; ON THE final purchase." So, it's the
[1:12:13] earnest. The Holy GHOST IS GOD'S DOWN
[1:12:15] PAYMENT. Do you realize how vital it is
[1:12:18] to have the token? How important IT IS?
[1:12:20] THAT'S GOD'S DOWN PAYMENT. THAT'S HIM
[1:12:23] BUYING AN INTEREST in you,
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; right? And so he's he's making a down
[1:12:28] payment on you that you're going to make
[1:12:30] it. And he ain't never lost his money
[1:12:32] yet.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; Right? He's a good businessman. He
[1:12:35] doesn't lose his down payment. Ephesians
[1:12:37] 4:30 tells us to grieve not the Holy
[1:12:39] SPIRIT OF GOD, WHEREBY you're sealed
[1:12:42] unto the day of redemption. WHEN HE PUTS
[1:12:45] HIS DOWN PAYMENT seal in you, he seals
[1:12:48] you to the day of of redemption. Brother
[1:12:50] said, "It's just LIKE A DOWN PAYMENT ON
[1:12:51] A CAR." ARE YOU still with me? I won't
[1:12:53] be much longer. He said, "IT'S LIKE A
[1:12:55] DOWN PAYMENT ON A CAR." HE SAID, "YOU
[1:12:57] PUT $500 DOWN." He said, "The car cost
[1:12:59] $3,000." He said, "But you put $500
[1:13:01] down. Say, I'll be back to get the
[1:13:03] rest." That's the same thing he did when
[1:13:04] he gave you the Holy Ghost. HE PUT
[1:13:06] SOMETHING IN YOU AND HE SAID, "I'LL BE
[1:13:08] BACK TO GET THE REST of them."
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandham uses the example
[1:13:16] of a 95year-old preacher.
[1:13:20] All right. So, some of you elders can
[1:13:22] fellowship with me for a moment. I don't
[1:13:25] think we have a person in the church
[1:13:26] that's 95 yet. Sister Fritz, I think,
[1:13:28] just turned 92, but I I called her older
[1:13:31] than that a couple times from the
[1:13:32] pulpit. I'm sorry, Sister Fritz.
[1:13:35] But, but there was a 95-year-old
[1:13:37] Pentecostal preacher
[1:13:39] and he was brother Brandon. He got up
[1:13:42] there and he said, "My goodness, why why
[1:13:44] wouldn't they call somebody else to
[1:13:45] preach in this big convention? Why
[1:13:48] wouldn't they let one of these young
[1:13:49] guys preach? Said they almost had to
[1:13:50] lead him to the pulpit. He got up there
[1:13:52] and he started to read his text and
[1:13:55] preach out of Job. And brother B said he
[1:13:57] got to preaching. He said and he clicked
[1:14:00] his heels together, jumped up in the air
[1:14:02] and he said, "You ain't got room enough
[1:14:04] up here for me to preach."
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; He said he got out there and he started
[1:14:08] preaching and he said, "Whoopy,
[1:14:10] hallelujah, glory." Got to jumping up
[1:14:11] and down like that. Said, "Oh, you ain't
[1:14:14] GOT ENOUGH ROOM HERE FOR ME TO PREACH."
[1:14:16] TOOK OFF DOWN THE FLOOR LIKE THAT AS
[1:14:17] HARD AS HE COULD GO. HE SAID, "AND
[1:14:19] THAT'S JUST THE EARNEST,
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; THE HOLY SPIRIT THAT WE FEEL IN THE
[1:14:23] SERVICES, THE PRESENCE OF GOD THAT WE
[1:14:25] HAVE ALL AROUND US." HAVE YOU EVER BEEN
[1:14:26] SO LOST IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD THAT IT
[1:14:28] FELT LIKE YOU WERE DRUNK AND YOU JUST
[1:14:30] FELT SUCH A AN OVERWHELMING SENSE OF THE
[1:14:33] THAT'S JUST A DOWN PAYMENT OF WHAT GOD
[1:14:35] WANTS TO DO FOR YOU.
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; IT'S JUST A DOWN PAYMENT OF WHAT HE IS
[1:14:39] GOING TO DO FOR YOU one day.
[1:14:42] The love that you have for one another,
[1:14:44] IT'S JUST A DOWN PAYMENT ON the love
[1:14:46] that we'll have for one another there.
[1:14:48] Ephesians 2:1 says, "He has quickened us
[1:14:51] who were dead in trespasses and sins.
[1:14:53] You hath he quickened." He's quickened.
[1:14:54] What does quickened mean? MADE ALIVE,
[1:14:56] JUST ABOUT GONE, BUT HE QUICKENED YOU BY
[1:14:59] THE earnest money. What will it be when
[1:15:03] you really get all the dividends paid
[1:15:05] on?
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; So when you GOT THE HOLY GHOST, you you
[1:15:09] were in debt. You were you owed a debt
[1:15:12] that you couldn't pay. And your bank
[1:15:13] account was negative500 million billion
[1:15:16] dollars. And and he made a deposit in
[1:15:19] your life. IT WAS ENOUGH TO COVER YOU.
[1:15:21] IT WAS ENOUGH TO KEEP YOU. IT WAS ENOUGH
[1:15:23] TO HELP YOU THROUGH LIFE. IT WAS A
[1:15:25] COMFORT TO YOU. AND YOU FOUND OUT YOU
[1:15:27] COULD GO BUY WHATEVER HE PROMISED IN HIS
[1:15:29] WORD. YOU COULD go get it. That's what
[1:15:31] the Holy Ghost is, church. I want YOU TO
[1:15:33] WANT IT. WE don't beat people over the
[1:15:35] head and say, "Oh, you you got to HAVE
[1:15:37] THE HOLY GHOST OR WE'RE going to, you
[1:15:38] know, beat you over the head till you
[1:15:40] do." That's not how people get THE HOLY
[1:15:41] GHOST. BUT IT'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING THAT
[1:15:42] YOU WANT BECAUSE I I WANT THAT
[1:15:44] ASSURANCE. I WANT THAT SEAL. I WANT THAT
[1:15:46] TOKEN. I WANT THAT SOMETHING THAT'S
[1:15:48] GOING TO KEEP ME THROUGH LIFE.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; What is it that's kept SOME OF OUR
[1:15:52] ELDERS? WHAT IS IT THAT'S KEPT SOMEBODY
[1:15:55] WHO MAYBE WAS out in sin AND SERVING THE
[1:15:57] DEVIL? ONE DAY GOD COME AND CHANGE THEIR
[1:15:59] LIFE AND SEALED THEM AND GIVE THEM THE
[1:16:00] BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST. THE SAME
[1:16:02] THING THAT KEPT HIM IS JUST THE EARNEST
[1:16:04] ON WHAT HE'S going to do one day at the
[1:16:06] change of our bodies.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:11] Amen. He said, "What'll it be when you
[1:16:12] really get all the dividends paid?"
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:18] The Bible says, "As it is written, I
[1:16:19] hath not seen nor ear heard, neither
[1:16:23] have ENTERED INTO THE HEART OF MAN." 1
[1:16:26] Corinthians 2:9, the things which God
[1:16:29] hath prepared for them that love him.
[1:16:33] What will that be?
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; You talk about joy unspeakable and full
[1:16:37] of glory. He said, "You who were once
[1:16:39] dead in sin and trespasses has he
[1:16:41] quickened together by the shadow of the
[1:16:44] shadow of the shadows." Stay with me for
[1:16:46] just a moment. He said, "What we have
[1:16:48] now," he said, is the shadow of the
[1:16:50] shadow of the shadow of eternal life.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; Right? What man what made that man click
[1:16:57] his heels together is a shadow of the
[1:16:59] shadow of a shadow of eternal life.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; He said, "What's it going to be when you
[1:17:03] come to the shadow of the shadows into
[1:17:05] the shadow? The shadow then into the
[1:17:07] creek,
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; the creek into the river, the river into
[1:17:11] the ocean. What is it when you're way
[1:17:13] out there in redemption with a brand new
[1:17:15] body? You turn back to a young man alto
[1:17:17] together again or a young woman. You're
[1:17:19] never going to die no more." Oh, I hope
[1:17:21] church we could just believe it tonight.
[1:17:23] I I know there's a there's a spirit in
[1:17:26] people that makes them want to earn
[1:17:27] their salvation and makes them want to
[1:17:29] do those things. But if you could just
[1:17:31] recognize tonight, it's your
[1:17:33] inheritance. He wants to give it to you
[1:17:35] more than you want to have it. If you
[1:17:37] could just receive it today, listen in
[1:17:39] the book of Acts, they never after they
[1:17:40] tear it in the upper room, they never
[1:17:42] tear it again. DO YOU REALIZE THAT? BUT
[1:17:44] WHILE THE WORD WAS BEING PREACHED, THE
[1:17:46] HOLY GHOST FELL ON THOSE WHO HEARD the
[1:17:48] word.
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. As soon AS THEY WERE BAPTIZED,
[1:17:52] THEY RECEIVED THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY
[1:17:53] GHOST. WHY? They believed what was being
[1:17:55] said.
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I believe you can believe
[1:17:58] it tonight and the Holy Ghost can fall
[1:17:59] on you and then you can go and be
[1:18:01] baptized and live for God. Listen, he
[1:18:04] said he will he said it's a brand new
[1:18:06] body. What's it going to be? You're
[1:18:07] never going to die no more. He said
[1:18:09] we'll look down on earth and desire to
[1:18:11] come back,
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; but not by natural means. HE SAID HE'LL
[1:18:14] SPEAK SOMEDAY AND THE DEAD IN CHRIST
[1:18:16] SHALL RISE AND THEIR BODY THAT I ONCE
[1:18:18] LIVED IN WILL resurrect into a glorified
[1:18:20] body. I'll walk and I'll talk AND I'LL
[1:18:22] LIVE AND I'll enjoy. Hallelujah. I'll
[1:18:25] live through the eternal ages that is to
[1:18:27] come through Jesus Christ our Lord.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; Paul gets rather personal with the
[1:18:33] Ephesians. I'll just read the next few
[1:18:35] verses. Ephesians 1:15. Wherefore I
[1:18:37] also, after I heard of your faith in the
[1:18:39] Lord Jesus and love unto the saints,
[1:18:41] cease not to give thanks for you.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; I feel that way tonight,
[1:18:47] making mention of you in my prayers.
[1:18:50] That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[1:18:52] the Father of glory, may give unto you
[1:18:53] the spirit of wisdom. I prayed that so
[1:18:56] many times for while while you're
[1:18:58] reading, while you're hearing, while
[1:18:59] you're studying the word, it's okay to
[1:19:01] study it. And you don't have to take
[1:19:02] everything that's preached. Go study it
[1:19:04] out. But that the eyes of your
[1:19:07] understanding would be enlightened.
[1:19:09] Hallelujah. God would give you the
[1:19:11] spirit of wisdom and revelation of the
[1:19:12] knowledge of him. The eyes of your
[1:19:14] understanding being enlightened that you
[1:19:15] may know what is the hope of his calling
[1:19:18] and what the riches of the glory of his
[1:19:20] inheritance in the saints. And what is
[1:19:25] the exceeding greatness of his power to
[1:19:27] usward who believe according to the
[1:19:30] working of his mighty power which he
[1:19:32] wrought in Christ when he raised him
[1:19:34] from the dead and set him at his own
[1:19:35] right hand in heavenly places far above
[1:19:38] all principality and power and might and
[1:19:41] dominion. Every name that is named not
[1:19:43] only in this world but also in that
[1:19:44] which is to come put all things under
[1:19:47] his feet. gave him to be the head over
[1:19:50] all things to the church which is his
[1:19:51] body, the fullness of him that fleth all
[1:19:54] in all. As Paul kind of finishes up that
[1:19:58] personal note in the book of Ephesians,
[1:20:00] brother Brandham does the same thing at
[1:20:03] the end of the adoption series. If you
[1:20:04] haven't noticed, we've walked through
[1:20:06] the first chapter of Ephesians with
[1:20:07] brother Brandham in the adoption series.
[1:20:10] And brother Brandham says this. So
[1:20:11] little friends, let me tell you
[1:20:13] something here right now, my darling
[1:20:16] precious people. He said, "You here in
[1:20:18] this land and the others in tape lands
[1:20:20] which will be overseas and wherever you
[1:20:22] are." I believe that was a prophecy
[1:20:24] which will be overseas. They tell me
[1:20:25] there was no one overseas listening.
[1:20:27] When brother Brandham actually made that
[1:20:29] statement, there weren't people overseas
[1:20:31] listening to tapes, but there are now.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; He said, "And wherever you are, don't be
[1:20:36] afraid. Everything's all right."
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; Can we grab a hold of this today? Can we
[1:20:41] hear the words of a prophet as they must
[1:20:43] have heard it in that first church age
[1:20:44] at the end of chapter one of Ephesians
[1:20:47] as they he began to tell them I pray for
[1:20:49] you I mention you in my prayers and
[1:20:51] brother Brandham's beginning to tell us
[1:20:53] he said everything's all right father
[1:20:55] God before the foundation of the world
[1:20:57] knew everything that would happen
[1:20:58] everything works right along you love
[1:21:00] him he said keep your heart right
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; and remember WHEN THIS BREATH PASSES
[1:21:05] FROM THIS life to you old people or to
[1:21:09] you young people, you mothers, when you
[1:21:13] see your little babies, that little baby
[1:21:14] girl, girl baby that died when she
[1:21:16] wasn't 8 days old or 5 days old, she'll
[1:21:20] be a beautiful young woman when you see
[1:21:21] her.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I know some of y'all lost
[1:21:29] children in childbirth. You You can hold
[1:21:31] on to that.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; That old grandpa, he said, was also
[1:21:35] stooped over. He couldn't hardly see
[1:21:38] where he was going.
[1:21:40] When you see him, grandmother, he'll be
[1:21:42] a fine, handsome young man, just as
[1:21:44] young as about 20 years old, just in the
[1:21:46] splendor of youth.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; He'll be that way forever.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; See, brother Ben, why you get emotional
[1:21:54] about these things? Cuz I believe it.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; Because I believe it. I've seen the dark
[1:21:59] side of life. I'VE SEEN THE STRUGGLES
[1:22:00] PEOPLE GO THROUGH. I KNOW THAT WE CAN GO
[1:22:03] THROUGH HARD TIMES. I'M NOT TRYING TO
[1:22:04] MAKE IT SEEM LIKE NOTHING BAD EVER
[1:22:06] happens to a Christian. I'M TRYING TO
[1:22:07] SAY NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS, YOU HAVE AN
[1:22:09] INHERITANCE. THIS IS YOUR INHERITANCE.
[1:22:12] THIS IS MY INHERITANCE in Christ.
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; He said just he said he'll be a fine,
[1:22:19] handsome young man just as young as
[1:22:21] about 20 years old just in the splendor
[1:22:23] of youth and he'll be that way forever.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. You can touch his hand.
[1:22:31] You can shake hands with him. You'll
[1:22:32] throw your arms around him. But he won't
[1:22:34] be hubby. said he'll be brother. He
[1:22:37] said, "Oh my, he'll be so much greater
[1:22:39] than hubby." He said, "You think you
[1:22:41] loved him?" Sure you did. But that was
[1:22:43] Filio. Wait till you get Agapo.
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; He said that filio love up next to Agapo
[1:22:48] love is like a smoldering dump.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; Think about that for a minute. The
[1:22:54] greatest natural love that we could have
[1:22:56] for one another, he said, was like a
[1:22:58] smoldering dump. Like that old trash
[1:23:01] heap out there by by Ash Flat. a
[1:23:04] smoldering stinking dump up next to
[1:23:07] Agapo love. Brother Brandham encourages
[1:23:10] the people. He said, "Find your place."
[1:23:12] He said, "You might be nothing might not
[1:23:13] be nothing but a housewife." Well, you
[1:23:15] say, "Brother Brandom, I never done a
[1:23:16] thing in my life. I'm not a preacher."
[1:23:18] Well, maybe God brought you here to
[1:23:19] raise a family of children. And out of
[1:23:21] that family of children may come another
[1:23:23] family of children.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; So, it might be your grandchildren.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:29] He said that'll be a preacher that'll
[1:23:32] send a million souls to Christ. You had
[1:23:35] to be here. Oh, take heart. MOTHERS,
[1:23:38] WHY? FATHERS, WHY? You're doing
[1:23:40] something for God.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; It may not seem, YOU MAY NOT GET ASKED
[1:23:43] TO SING all the time. YOU MAY NOT GET
[1:23:45] ASKED TO SERVE IN THE church all the
[1:23:47] time, but let me say this. You're
[1:23:48] serving a purpose in God. He said, "You
[1:23:51] had to be here. You're here for a
[1:23:52] purpose." Well, you say all I ever done
[1:23:55] was harrow across these old claws AND
[1:23:57] I'D TAKE OUT EARLY in the evening.
[1:23:59] Didn't know how to make my kids a
[1:24:00] living. I looked at the poor little
[1:24:02] fellas with no shoes on. I sat and
[1:24:04] cried. I got an old buggy and me and
[1:24:06] Maul went to church.
[1:24:08] Most of us haven't experienced that. But
[1:24:10] if you think about it, we've experienced
[1:24:12] some hardship in life.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; Some of you fathers have worked and
[1:24:15] toiled with your own hands. Some of you
[1:24:18] bear the scars of that,
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; of working with your hands, trying to
[1:24:22] make your family a living. As I heard
[1:24:23] brother Homer Longoria say the other
[1:24:25] day, he said in Hardy, he said, "We
[1:24:26] didn't find a job." He said, "We
[1:24:28] invented one."
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; Cuz and it's true. Many of you have been
[1:24:33] around for a long time. You know what
[1:24:34] that's like. Excuse me for going just a
[1:24:36] few minutes long. I'm I'm done. But I
[1:24:38] just have to say this. I was talking to
[1:24:40] Sister Fritz the other day and and she
[1:24:42] inspired me because she told me that she
[1:24:44] had worked when she was younger and one
[1:24:46] day she lost her job and and and she uh
[1:24:49] she actually uh thought well she said I
[1:24:51] I got a car. She had bought a new car
[1:24:53] and she said I had to pay for it. So she
[1:24:55] went out in the field started chopping
[1:24:57] cotton. Back then you go out and hire
[1:24:59] yourself out chopping cotton out in the
[1:25:01] field in Arkansas. She went and chopping
[1:25:03] cotton like some of you have done.
[1:25:06] But there was a purpose in what God was
[1:25:08] doing in her life. She wasn't just
[1:25:10] chopping cotton. She was getting ready
[1:25:11] to be an inspiration to people. LISTEN,
[1:25:13] YOU WEREN'T JUST WORKING in a factory.
[1:25:15] You're getting ready to do something in
[1:25:17] your life. It may not be you. It may be
[1:25:18] your children, your grandchildren, YOUR
[1:25:20] GREAT-GRANDCHILDREN. BUT KEEP ON SERVING
[1:25:22] THE LORD. KEEP ON DOING WHAT YOU'RE
[1:25:24] DOING. KEEP ON DRIVING TO CHURCH. KEEP
[1:25:26] ON LOVING HIM WITH ALL OF YOUR HEART.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; It's worth it, CHURCH. IT'S WORTH EVERY
[1:25:30] MILE OF THE WAY. THIS IS OUR
[1:25:33] INHERITANCE.
[1:25:34] YES.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; Whether you're a factory worker, a
[1:25:37] salesman or a builder, whatever it is
[1:25:39] that you are, he said, "Don't you worry,
[1:25:41] brother.
[1:25:43] You just keep loving him.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; He's got a purpose for you.
[1:25:51] You just stay right the way you are.
[1:25:52] Just go right on.
[1:25:59] You may might not never preach a sermon,
[1:26:02] but you might be the great-grandfather
[1:26:04] of one that'll do it. Brother Brandon
[1:26:06] picked that up and he said Levi paid
[1:26:08] tithe in the loins of his
[1:26:10] greatgrandfather.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; Some of y'all are supporting. We talked
[1:26:16] about that building building things for
[1:26:19] a future generation. and you paid your
[1:26:20] offerings and your tithes and you didn't
[1:26:22] realize you were paying it for
[1:26:23] grandkids, great grandkids that the Lord
[1:26:25] carries.
[1:26:27] Some of you already have those.
[1:26:29] Find your place. We have a predestined
[1:26:32] inheritance in him. I took this last
[1:26:33] quote personally as the musicians come
[1:26:37] at the end of adoption number four,
[1:26:38] which is what we've been reading.
[1:26:41] Brother Ram said, "Young preacher,
[1:26:44] I don't know if I still qualify
[1:26:50] But ever since I've heard this, I took
[1:26:52] it personally last maybe 20, 25 years.
[1:26:56] Young preacher, get into the field. Stay
[1:26:59] into the harness.
[1:27:01] Brother Ben, why do you preach?
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; Because I was commissioned.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; Say, "Brother Ben, was it an angel come
[1:27:08] down to you?" I never had an angel come
[1:27:09] to me. I never saw a dream. Never never
[1:27:12] saw a vision that about preaching.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; I never did that. But God put something
[1:27:17] in my heart and a prophet of God and God
[1:27:20] he gave me the ability to talk to people
[1:27:24] and I started doing that. When I did it,
[1:27:25] he blessed it and he anointed me and and
[1:27:28] then one day, I'm not just talking about
[1:27:29] myself, but all these preachers, they've
[1:27:30] gone through similar things. And and one
[1:27:33] day I heard him say, "Young preacher,
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; get in the field.
[1:27:39] Stay in the harness. All you young
[1:27:42] preachers and things, don't you sit
[1:27:44] around." So, I'm glad our young
[1:27:45] preachers get out and go and and brother
[1:27:48] Stewart will be serving here and brother
[1:27:50] Joel will be serving in Van Beern and
[1:27:51] I'll be serving in Galina. But you're
[1:27:53] all a part of that.
[1:27:56] Don't just sit and do nothing. Go out
[1:27:58] yonder and win a soul. Do something. Get
[1:28:01] on. Get moving. Don't stop. I love that.
[1:28:04] I don't care who tells me to stop. I
[1:28:06] took this personally. Prophet of God
[1:28:08] said, "Don't stop.
[1:28:10] Get moving. Don't stop." young preacher
[1:28:12] over there. He said, "God bless your
[1:28:14] heart." Oh, God. Listen, you may feel
[1:28:17] like the lowest part of the body
[1:28:19] tonight, but your inheritance is in him.
[1:28:22] It was bought by him. You're still an
[1:28:24] overcomer. Take your position and stand.
[1:28:28] He knew you would or he would have never
[1:28:29] called you to it. Aren't you glad he
[1:28:31] called you? Let's stand in our position.
[1:28:34] He said, "What? How do we come to
[1:28:35] sunship?" He said, "Stand still and see
[1:28:38] the salvation of the Lord." Amen. Let's
[1:28:40] stand together. Hallelujah.
[1:28:44] Heavenly Father, we love you today. And
[1:28:47] we thank you for your word.
[1:28:49] Or maybe there'd be someone here who's
[1:28:51] never allowed that spirit, Lord, to come
[1:28:54] into their life. They just still have
[1:28:57] this natural spirit that Lord, you gave
[1:28:59] that to them. You're the giver of all
[1:29:01] life. Even Cain in that sense came from
[1:29:05] the Lord.
[1:29:06] But oh God,
[1:29:09] Lord, we believe that you gave us this
[1:29:11] life. Maybe there'd be somebody here
[1:29:13] that has never really accepted your life
[1:29:16] into their heart. I pray that they would
[1:29:19] do that today. I pray you'd you'd go
[1:29:22] into them, Lord, and fill them with a
[1:29:24] baptism of the Holy Ghost and fire.
[1:29:27] Cleanse out all the draw. Sanctify us,
[1:29:29] Lord. Oh God, help us to be believers.
[1:29:33] Sanctify us. Fill us with the Holy
[1:29:35] Ghost.
[1:29:36] make us ready for your soon coming. I
[1:29:38] pray I pray for these people or maybe
[1:29:41] they get discouraged and weary and
[1:29:42] welloing. I pray that they go back and
[1:29:44] read Ephesians chapter 1. Find out that
[1:29:48] they were elected to be what they are
[1:29:50] fornown by God they have an inheritance
[1:29:53] in Christ. I pray that you'd grant that.
[1:29:56] Lord, I pray that you'd move in every
[1:29:58] situation, every home, and every in
[1:30:01] every sick room. Lord, every hospital
[1:30:04] room. I pray that you go where they're
[1:30:05] at. Lord, bless them tonight. I pray in
[1:30:09] Jesus' name.
[1:30:11] Amen. Amen. Let's just worship him. Can
[1:30:14] we do that? And let's just while we have
[1:30:16] an opportunity, several of us here on a
[1:30:18] Wednesday night, let's just raise our
[1:30:20] hands to him and say, "Lord, I thank
[1:30:22] you. I thank you, Lord, for my
[1:30:24] inheritance. Thank you for the love that
[1:30:27] you shown me before the foundation of
[1:30:29] the world." Can we do that? Oh, and
[1:30:33] though the cost
[1:30:36] be great
[1:30:39] for you. Now make your pledge to him
[1:30:41] with your hands raised up to him. Jesus,
[1:30:43] use me. Oh
[1:30:46] Jesus,
[1:30:50] use me. Oh
[1:30:55] no.
[1:30:56] Refuse me. Oh surely. Oh, surely
[1:31:02] there's
[1:31:03] a work that I
[1:31:07] can do.
[1:31:09] Hallelujah. Even though it's humble.
[1:31:13] Oh,
[1:31:15] the Lord
[1:31:17] is humble.
[1:31:23] My will to crumble.
[1:31:26] Though the cost be great, Lord.
[1:31:30] The cost be great.
[1:31:33] I'll work for you. The altar's open. If
[1:31:36] you need to pray, God bless you tonight.
[1:31:38] Be praying for Brother Joel and for each
[1:31:39] one. Oh, sing it now.
[1:31:43] Oh Jesus, use me.
[1:31:48] Oh Lord,
[1:31:50] don't refuse me.
[1:31:55] For surely
[1:31:57] there's a word that I
[1:32:06] Heat.
[1:32:21] Heat.
[1:32:46] the world
[1:32:49] that he
[1:32:52] the same.
[1:32:56] Oh, he's the same,
[1:33:00] yesterday
[1:33:05] and forever.
[1:33:09] Jesus
[1:33:11] is alive
[1:33:14] and well.
[1:33:17] Oh, he's alive
[1:33:21] and well.
[1:33:24] He's living in me
[1:33:27] to tell
[1:33:30] the world
[1:33:33] that he
[1:33:35] the same.
[1:33:38] Yes, he is. Oh, he's the same
[1:33:43] yesterday,
[1:33:46] today,
[1:33:48] and forever.
[1:33:52] Jesus
[1:33:54] is alive
[1:33:57] and well.
[1:33:59] Sing it again now. Oh, he is alive
[1:34:04] and he's well.
[1:34:07] He's living in me
[1:34:10] to tell
[1:34:13] the world
[1:34:16] that he is the same.

[1:34:26] yesterday,
[1:34:28] today
[1:34:32] forever.

[1:34:37] is alive
[1:34:40] and well.
[1:34:43] Give him a big hand clap of praise if
[1:34:44] you love him.

[1:34:52] how he saved me, how he raised me, how
[1:34:57] he filled me with the Holy Ghost, how he
[1:35:01] healed me to the uttermost.
[1:35:05] When I think about the Lord,
[1:35:09] how he picked me up and turned me
[1:35:13] around, how he placed my feet
[1:35:17] on solid ground.
[1:35:20] It makes me want to shout, "Hallelujah.
[1:35:26] Thank you, Jesus. Lord, you're worthy of
[1:35:30] all the glory and all the honor and all
[1:35:35] the praise. Oh, it makes me want to
