[44:56] you in church tonight my goodness just
[44:57] about a full Wednesday night crowd and
[45:00] good to see that and we just love each
[45:02] and every one of you and uh was our
[45:05] hearts were thrilled to hear of the baby
[45:07] being born that's a miracle baby and we
[45:09] give that testimony when we we get an
[45:11] opportunity maybe maybe when we
[45:13] dedicated if we do that and to let us do
[45:16] that so but we sure we sure appreciate
[45:19] our families our young people and and
[45:21] you know they grow up and then they get
[45:23] married and have kids and you want to
[45:25] see them uh come along and and the lord
[45:28] to bless them and in whatever way and
[45:30] there'll be many trials but our God is
[45:32] always a faithful God he's the same
[45:35] yesterday today and forever he's a
[45:37] Healer how many believe that tonight
[45:39] he's a redeemer he's a savior we see our
[45:41] little ones even here tonight our little
[45:44] babies here and young people and kids
[45:46] God has blessed us abundantly we should
[45:48] never lose sight of that see our elders
[45:50] here in the house of God With Us have
[45:52] the strength to come out on a Wednesday
[45:53] night God bless you for coming amen I
[45:56] can just stand up here and Worship the
[45:57] Lord all night for what he's done for us
[46:00] our young men our young people our young
[46:01] ladies so thankful for all of you
[46:03] tonight and what God has done in our
[46:06] lives Genesis 49 And1 says Jacob called
[46:09] unto his sons and said Gather yourselves
[46:12] together that I may tell you that which
[46:15] shall befall you in the last days gather
[46:19] yourselves together and hear ye sons of
[46:21] Jacob and hearken unto Israel your
[46:24] father so this will be more than just a
[46:28] a father wanting his kids to do well in
[46:30] life but it would be an actual word
[46:33] spoken by a prophet spoken over these
[46:36] children these uh these young men and I
[46:41] want to deal with Ruben tonight so we'll
[46:43] read this Ruben Thou Art my firstborn my
[46:46] might and the beginning of my strength
[46:48] the Excellency of dignity and the
[46:51] Excellency of power
[46:53] unstable as water Thou shalt not Excel
[46:57] because thou wentest up to thy father's
[46:58] bed then defiles thou it he went up to
[47:01] my couch I pray the Lord would add his
[47:02] Blessing to the word you may be
[47:06] seated we dealt and began last week
[47:09] dealing with our allotment in the
[47:10] promise uh brother Stewart picked up
[47:13] very nicely on that on Sunday uh we
[47:15] enjoyed the services I got to watch some
[47:17] of the service Sunday morning some of
[47:18] the service Sunday night and as we were
[47:21] brother uh Ben beards he's the pastor
[47:24] there in in Galina and uh those people
[47:27] sent their greetings as well and just
[47:29] become a sister Church to us and so I
[47:31] wanted to go do that for them but while
[47:34] we were uh preaching for them and by the
[47:36] way brother Ben's going to come preach
[47:38] for us sometime in April last year we
[47:40] had him you remember the snowstorm and
[47:43] so I'm trying to make it as far away
[47:45] from a snowstorm as possible but if
[47:46] you'll remember he uh that Sunday
[47:48] morning went just a little bit lengthy
[47:51] and I returned the favor this weekend so
[47:53] we're all all good I we called the truth
[47:57] and the war's over so so he'll be back
[48:00] preaching for us at some point this
[48:02] spring uh but we're dealing with this uh
[48:06] this allotment and looking at the the 12
[48:09] tribes that are were given a portion of
[48:12] the land and I was saying we enjoyed
[48:15] that Sunday brother Stuart mentioned
[48:16] that allotment as well when it pertained
[48:18] to Paul and and the New
[48:21] Testament and we we realized that
[48:24] brother brandham said that when Joshua
[48:25] divided the inheritance to the people he
[48:27] said each person was placed positionally
[48:30] exactly he said the way these Hebrew
[48:32] mothers named those children now it's
[48:35] not always Apparent from the name itself
[48:38] just what it was but brother Bram tells
[48:40] us in dealing with this he says uh he
[48:42] says if you're looking at it and you
[48:44] don't see how it all fits together he
[48:45] said remember he said the Bible's not
[48:47] wrong he said maybe the way you're
[48:49] thinking about it's wrong so we know the
[48:51] word of God's always right so he said uh
[48:54] each one they named those children how
[48:56] they repl in Palestine just at their
[48:58] place Asher Gad and AP each one Judah
[49:01] everyone just placed in their position
[49:03] he said what a wonderful picture it gets
[49:05] us because it's a type of God placing in
[49:08] the church so as we talk about this we
[49:10] don't want to lose sight of our type
[49:13] that it's God placing us and we want to
[49:16] find our place and our position and what
[49:19] our boundaries are and so and so he said
[49:22] it's a type of God placing in the church
[49:24] himself every member so if you're a part
[49:27] of the Church of God if you're part of
[49:28] the Bride tonight uh God has placed you
[49:31] in the church you're not here by
[49:34] accident he did that
[49:36] himself right every member men and women
[49:39] boys and girls all of you together all
[49:41] of us together he said every place every
[49:44] Christian to itself he talked about
[49:47] Solomon's Temple and I didn't have time
[49:48] for the full quote but he said there
[49:50] were some odd rocks that we don't always
[49:53] understand I just love that quote
[49:55] because I I resemble that quote little
[49:58] bit odd rocks we don't always understand
[50:00] but yet God they fit in somewhere
[50:03] there's a place for them in the temple
[50:05] of God so he said Joshua by inspiration
[50:08] not just
[50:10] mathematics but inspired by God how many
[50:14] uh believe that tonight he was inspired
[50:16] by God and he lotted each one of those
[50:18] Patriarchs in in their position just
[50:22] exactly the way their name belongs so
[50:26] the first son born to Jacob was reuben
[50:29] reuben not the sandwich I I I mentioned
[50:32] that I wasn't even thinking about that
[50:34] and I mentioned uh I was going to be
[50:36] preaching on Ruben and Joel said well
[50:38] you're going to make everybody hungry
[50:39] and it it didn't occur to me just what
[50:41] he meant at first and then uh I I
[50:44] mentioned it to trip and he's like the
[50:46] sandwich and
[50:48] no no Reuben the the patriarch Jacob's
[50:53] eldest son and so the sandwich was named
[50:56] after a Jewish man in New York City
[50:58] whose name was Reuben and so uh but and
[51:01] and Reuben literally you say well what
[51:03] deep meaning does the name have well
[51:06] Reuben his name literally means Behold a
[51:14] son we just close up and go home that's
[51:17] what Ruben means Behold a son or look a
[51:22] son and there there's more meaning to
[51:24] that than what we realize because
[51:26] remember when Leah his mother had him
[51:29] we've talked about Leah she Genesis
[51:33] 29:32 said Leah conceived and bear a son
[51:35] she called his name Ruben for she said
[51:38] surely the Lord hath looked upon my
[51:40] Affliction what was her Affliction she
[51:42] was loved less than Rachel remember
[51:45] Rachel was the favorite and and anytime
[51:48] you got two wives that'll be a problem
[51:50] just warning you so if you plan on
[51:52] having more than one wife that's a
[51:54] problem so you going love one more than
[51:57] the other it's just the way that it is
[51:59] and so uh she she was loved more uh than
[52:03] Rachel and yet it was Leah who was
[52:05] buried with Jacob in the place of the
[52:08] Resurrection so it was Leah who raised
[52:11] with him and so uh Leah was you could
[52:13] say Leah was God's
[52:15] choice right even for Jacob uh maybe
[52:18] Jacob didn't recognize that but it was
[52:21] so so he said surely the Lord hath
[52:23] looked upon my Affliction now therefore
[52:25] my husband love me and that's just a
[52:27] really pathetic uh kind of thought but
[52:30] so she says look a son right it's a son
[52:34] I had a son surely my husband will love
[52:37] me
[52:38] now so and again there was favoritism in
[52:41] the family and he was tricked into
[52:43] marrying Leah so he never did just treat
[52:45] her quite the same way but uh it speaks
[52:50] uh look you know Behold a son or look a
[52:52] son speaks of an eldest son who's never
[52:55] really treated as an eldest son because
[52:58] think about it and we'll get into it a
[53:00] little bit later but Reuben was the
[53:02] oldest but he didn't have the birth
[53:04] right he was the oldest but he didn't
[53:07] wasn't the first one to inherit he was
[53:10] the oldest but not the one not the tribe
[53:12] that Christ come from in in the natural
[53:15] right he was the oldest and all of those
[53:17] things just by rights looking at it the
[53:20] way the custom was should have come from
[53:23] him but it didn't so you'll find that in
[53:27] these birth orders and I want us to
[53:29] understand this that there was an
[53:31] allotment and there's an allotment given
[53:33] to you there's a certain place and
[53:34] something that you should be doing and
[53:37] yet Brother Bruce it's not we're not
[53:39] we're not tied necessarily there's a
[53:42] little room in that for us to become
[53:45] there there's a mystery hidden in that
[53:47] if I could say it that way so the land
[53:50] was had boundaries right and they were
[53:52] each given a certain allotment in the
[53:54] land but what was in that land was a
[53:56] mystery and only when it was worked by
[53:59] the children of Israel would it become
[54:01] exactly what it was supposed to be and
[54:04] so how each one worked it
[54:06] mattered in the land so there's an
[54:10] election right that God elected them to
[54:12] a certain spot and there's a placing
[54:15] that God has placed you in a certain
[54:16] spot and yet yet how you work that land
[54:20] matters right right so there's grace and
[54:23] works the two coming together brandom
[54:25] taught us that Grace is what God does
[54:27] for you he said works is what you do for
[54:29] God right and and and he said that uh uh
[54:33] he said Paul in in Hebrews was speaking
[54:36] what God saw he said Abraham was
[54:38] justified by faith and in Romans and
[54:40] James looked at what man saw and said he
[54:42] was justified by works yes right because
[54:45] there was room within the boundaries of
[54:47] that to believe or to
[54:49] disbelieve right to to accept What God
[54:52] Says and and and live the gospel or not
[54:55] and we still have that ability today
[54:57] we're free moral agents and yet you
[54:59] can't be what you're not once you're
[55:02] called and what you're place then you
[55:04] have room to improve that and and make
[55:06] that what everything you can be
[55:08] everything God called you to be or you
[55:11] could be less than that and so uh you're
[55:13] not helpless tonight you're not we're
[55:15] not sitting here saying well just what
[55:17] will be will be and that's not the case
[55:19] at all but we're Fighters we're we're
[55:21] warriors we come out and and we want to
[55:24] improve the the land that God's given us
[55:26] we want to build it we want to we want
[55:28] to do all that we can for the kingdom of
[55:30] God we we're not just going to sit here
[55:32] we're going to do something about
[55:34] it so we know that the promise is to the
[55:36] Overcomer he said your seed will possess
[55:39] the Gate of the enemy but somebody's got
[55:42] to do the
[55:43] possessing right somebody had to do the
[55:45] fighting but he promised it was possible
[55:49] Right somebody's got to got to pick up
[55:51] the gates and carry them up the hill but
[55:53] but but he promised it was possible it
[55:55] may be impossible for
[55:56] but it's possible for you but now that
[55:59] it's possible you've got to do something
[56:01] about it so the the the bride is the
[56:03] ones that will overcome they're the ones
[56:05] that will press the battle they're the
[56:07] ones that will do what God called them
[56:09] to do they're not just going to sit back
[56:11] and say well I I'm just waiting on God
[56:13] to do no he's already given you the word
[56:15] he's already given you an open book He's
[56:17] already given you the land to to be a
[56:20] part of we're in the land let's look
[56:22] around and see what's ours take
[56:24] advantage of it all right So you you're
[56:26] already healed how many believe that
[56:28] tonight healing is in the land it's part
[56:30] of your land right that's in the land
[56:33] but but we got to have the faith to
[56:35] appropriate that we got to have the
[56:37] faith to reach out and grab a hold of
[56:39] that that's what we
[56:41] do right now in in all seven Church ages
[56:47] there was a promise given to the
[56:50] Overcomer someone say it with me tonight
[56:52] the
[56:53] Overcomer in Ephesus he said to him that
[56:55] over cometh I give to eat of the Tree of
[56:58] Life Revelation 2:7 he said and which is
[57:02] in the midst of the paradise of God to
[57:05] Smyrna he said he that overcometh shall
[57:07] not be hurt of the second death to
[57:10] pergamum he says uh he says to him that
[57:13] overcometh will I give to eat of the
[57:14] Hidden Mana I will give him a white
[57:16] stone in the stone a new name written
[57:18] which no man knowth saving he that
[57:20] received if you haven't read your church
[57:21] AIDS book in a while the brandom goes
[57:24] into each one of those and tells us what
[57:25] they are
[57:27] in thyra he said he that overcometh and
[57:30] keepeth my Works to the end he said well
[57:33] I just Coast on by but see each each age
[57:36] was given a part of the land and we've
[57:39] been given all of it brother brandom
[57:41] taught us these these blessings these
[57:43] promises were
[57:44] cumulative right that we don't just get
[57:47] one of them we get all of them to him
[57:50] every age we get all of it cuz the
[57:53] land's all ours this is the land where
[57:55] all the promises lay are you with me
[57:57] tonight this is the country where
[58:00] anything where all things are possible
[58:02] but you got to go take advantage of that
[58:04] right he said he that overcometh and
[58:06] keepeth my Works to the end to him will
[58:08] I give power over the Nations he shall
[58:10] rule them with a rod of iron and the
[58:12] vessels of the Potter shall they be
[58:14] broken into Shivers even as I received
[58:15] my father Sardis he said he that
[58:17] overcometh the same shall be clothed in
[58:19] white rain and I will not blot out his
[58:21] name out of the book of life I'm so
[58:24] grateful for that but I will confess his
[58:26] name before my father and before his
[58:28] angels I'm just reading these two you
[58:30] don't have time to go into all what they
[58:31] mean but he said him that overcometh in
[58:34] Philadelphia I make a pillar in the
[58:36] temple of my god oh I want to be a
[58:38] pillar in the temple of God he shall go
[58:41] no more out I will write upon him the
[58:42] name of my God the name of the city of
[58:45] my God which is New Jerusalem which
[58:46] cometh down out of Heaven from my God he
[58:49] he said I will write upon him my new
[58:51] name Leia he said to him that overcometh
[58:54] will I grant to sit with me and my
[58:56] Throne this is our specific promise yes
[59:00] they all apply to
[59:02] us he said even as I also overcame and
[59:05] sat down with my father and his throne
[59:09] so Revelation 21:7 kind of sums it up NE
[59:12] neatly says now who's going to do this
[59:14] he that
[59:17] overcometh now and I kind of give you a
[59:20] little hint where we're going but look
[59:23] sometimes you got to overcome your
[59:25] position
[59:26] yes right and overcome in your position
[59:30] right right because how does a preacher
[59:32] overcome in his
[59:34] position how you got to fight for that
[59:37] right you got to fight to study you got
[59:39] to fight to preach you got to fight your
[59:41] body fight your voice fight fight the
[59:43] elements fight I start to say fight the
[59:46] people but that's not exactly
[59:49] right he told Jeremiah he said don't be
[59:51] afraid of their faces you
[59:54] knowuh but but you got got to fight in
[59:57] your position to get what God has called
[1:00:00] you to to get and to become right and so
[1:00:03] God's made you a certain thing and I've
[1:00:05] told you many times brother Daryl Ward
[1:00:06] told me years ago he said he said you
[1:00:09] may only be a 10-cent preacher he said
[1:00:11] but if you uh if you only give God an
[1:00:13] nickel he said you've robbed God of five
[1:00:16] cents right that's just basic
[1:00:18] math right but you want to be all that
[1:00:21] God's called you to be you can't be what
[1:00:23] somebody else has called you to be but
[1:00:25] you want to be all that God has called
[1:00:26] you to be so in looking at these birth
[1:00:29] pths we need to be careful that we
[1:00:31] recognize this now now he said he that
[1:00:34] overcometh Revelation 21:7 shall inherit
[1:00:37] all things someone say it with me all
[1:00:40] things and I will be his God and he
[1:00:43] shall be my son who will do that he that
[1:00:45] overcometh so God's way is never changed
[1:00:47] you are his chosen elected bride but you
[1:00:50] got to make yourself ready now how you
[1:00:51] going to do that by Grace by the provide
[1:00:55] provision of the word by what he's
[1:00:56] already given you of the word you you
[1:00:58] don't have to create a dress to put on
[1:01:01] he's given you a word to be dressed in
[1:01:04] but what do you have to do you got to
[1:01:05] put it on all right all you got to do is
[1:01:08] put it on all you got to do is take
[1:01:10] advantage we have the word we have the
[1:01:12] spirit all you got to do is grab a hold
[1:01:14] of come on Church somebody is going to
[1:01:16] do it somebody is going to grab a hold
[1:01:18] of the word and dress themselves and be
[1:01:20] made ready for the Rapture I want to be
[1:01:23] part of that group yeah so he said let
[1:01:25] us be glad and rejoice give honor to him
[1:01:27] for the marriage of the Lamb is come and
[1:01:29] his wife hath made herself
[1:01:32] ready right that's what we do that's our
[1:01:35] part so brother brandom says about that
[1:01:37] so many he says that the Lord will take
[1:01:39] this evil spirit from me from drinking
[1:01:40] gambling lying stealing I'll Ser him but
[1:01:43] that's up to you yes sir and and you say
[1:01:46] well brother Ben I know I know that I
[1:01:49] should give that up to the Lord that's
[1:01:50] true but the giving up is what he's
[1:01:52] talking about
[1:01:54] yeah right the giving up is what you can
[1:01:57] do you can't take away the desire for
[1:02:00] alcohol but you can give it up that's
[1:02:02] right right you can't take away the
[1:02:04] desire for cigarettes but you can give
[1:02:06] it up and let him take it away so he
[1:02:09] he'll never take it away from you pull
[1:02:11] it out of your your hands as you grasp
[1:02:13] for it you've got to give it up
[1:02:15] surrender it to him and then he'll take
[1:02:17] it away right and so you got to give it
[1:02:21] up and that's how we overcome they that
[1:02:23] overcome he said shall inherit all
[1:02:25] things they that over come you have
[1:02:26] power to do it but you must be willing
[1:02:28] to lay it down see he said she has made
[1:02:31] herself ready I like that word and again
[1:02:34] it's not a self-help program but you got
[1:02:36] to be willing because the Battleground
[1:02:38] is in the mind right so if you don't
[1:02:40] want to be depressed all the time you
[1:02:42] got to be willing to get rid of that but
[1:02:44] the but peace is here for you salvation
[1:02:48] is here for you Joy is here for you you
[1:02:51] don't have to live that way you don't
[1:02:52] have to remain like that it's here for
[1:02:54] you but you got be willing to lay it
[1:02:56] down say Lord I lay it at your feet yes
[1:02:59] sir
[1:03:00] right he said you see God cannot push us
[1:03:03] through a little pipe pull us out on the
[1:03:04] other end and then say blessed is he
[1:03:05] that overcometh you had nothing to
[1:03:07] overcome he just pushed you through but
[1:03:09] you got to make decisions for yourself I
[1:03:11] have to make decisions for myself doing
[1:03:13] that we show our faith and respects to
[1:03:14] God so we see this weaving through these
[1:03:17] these young men we see God's purpose and
[1:03:19] call and election and we see their
[1:03:22] actions that don't always match that and
[1:03:25] yet it turns out exactly how God wants
[1:03:26] it to in the end right right cuz he's
[1:03:30] got everything in his
[1:03:32] control so and he knows what we'll do
[1:03:36] with it
[1:03:37] now brother BR said Abraham was promised
[1:03:39] a child but he must maintain that
[1:03:41] promise for 25 years through the ups and
[1:03:44] downs and temptations but he held to the
[1:03:46] word of that promise and Israel was
[1:03:48] promised a promis land so brother Brown
[1:03:50] ties these things together he said but
[1:03:52] they had to fight for every inch of it
[1:03:55] wherever the The Souls of your foot
[1:03:56] Treads upon that have I given you God
[1:03:59] said to Joshua but did you ever think
[1:04:01] about that and and they're out there
[1:04:03] walking said oh goody I don't have to
[1:04:05] fight but they had to walk with a sword
[1:04:08] in their
[1:04:08] hand everywhere they stepped God
[1:04:12] footsteps are possession God gave that
[1:04:14] to them but they had to fight every
[1:04:16] devil in hell trying to get them knock
[1:04:18] them off of that place listen to me
[1:04:20] Church you God's giv you a land he's giv
[1:04:22] you healing he's giv you peace he's giv
[1:04:24] you uh let you sit in Heavenly places in
[1:04:27] Christ but every devil in hell is going
[1:04:28] to try to knock you off of that place
[1:04:30] going to try to make it where you can't
[1:04:31] worship God no more going to try to make
[1:04:33] it where you can't come on Church go try
[1:04:35] to make it where you you don't enjoy
[1:04:37] church no more and you don't enjoy
[1:04:39] prayer time no more and you can't you
[1:04:41] can't read your Bible no more every
[1:04:42] devil in hell is going to try to get you
[1:04:44] so wrapped up in drama going around the
[1:04:46] church or Facebook or something else to
[1:04:48] try to make it where you don't have time
[1:04:49] to spend with God but an overcomer will
[1:04:52] grab a hold of it anyway and say this is
[1:04:54] my land this is my promise I'm going to
[1:04:57] live for
[1:04:58] God good see the land was there God gave
[1:05:03] it to them but they must fight for
[1:05:06] it right so that's a principle now you
[1:05:08] say what does that have to do with Ruben
[1:05:10] you're going to find
[1:05:12] out so God has got Amazing Grace to save
[1:05:16] you and he will do it but you'll fight
[1:05:18] every inch of your way yes brother BR
[1:05:21] talked about all how all of his ministry
[1:05:23] he fought he said but we must if we must
[1:05:26] reain so we find out the bride has to
[1:05:27] make herself ready be willing to lay
[1:05:30] aside every weight does so easily beset
[1:05:32] us so we might run with patience the
[1:05:34] race is set before us we must lay them
[1:05:37] aside ourself yeah we can't say God you
[1:05:39] come lay them aside for us we got to do
[1:05:42] that ourselves sir lay it down so he can
[1:05:46] take it away yeah are you with me now
[1:05:49] yeah how do we overcome because and we
[1:05:53] got to have something that these 12 sons
[1:05:56] that Jacob didn't have come on now in
[1:06:00] order to live in this age and be with
[1:06:02] all that God wants us to be be a perfect
[1:06:04] Bride for the groom perfect in his sight
[1:06:08] a mature bride we we're going to have to
[1:06:11] have something else that they they
[1:06:12] didn't have and that's the new
[1:06:14] birth right because what they were
[1:06:16] dealing with is just in the flesh but we
[1:06:19] have something that overcomes the Flesh
[1:06:22] and as you yield to the new birth that's
[1:06:25] what makes you an overcomer look at 1
[1:06:28] John 5:4 remember brother Brandon said
[1:06:30] part of overcoming was humility go
[1:06:32] listen to how can I overcome part of
[1:06:34] overcoming is humbling yourself to the
[1:06:36] word of God it's humility what is that
[1:06:39] it's it's surrender it's a surrender of
[1:06:41] self-will and what what you want to do
[1:06:43] and who you are and say Lord you make me
[1:06:45] what you want me to be so we overcome
[1:06:48] differently in that way what we're
[1:06:50] fighting with many times it's not some
[1:06:52] some uh listen Church we're not always
[1:06:54] we're not fighting some website
[1:06:56] somewhere or or some person or some
[1:06:59] Doctrine many times what we're fighting
[1:07:01] is right here right we're fighting a
[1:07:04] battle right here it's going on right
[1:07:06] here that's what's trying to keep you
[1:07:08] out of church that's what's trying to
[1:07:10] keep you from loving your neighbor
[1:07:12] that's what's trying to keep you from
[1:07:13] living the gospel it's right here so
[1:07:16] you're fighting that you're fighting
[1:07:18] every day and what are you doing but but
[1:07:20] the Bible says whatsoever is born of God
[1:07:23] overcometh the world yeah and this is
[1:07:26] the victory that overcometh the world
[1:07:28] even our faith so it's your faith in God
[1:07:32] and said I know I can't do it on my own
[1:07:34] but I can overcome depression because
[1:07:36] God said so God said he give me peace
[1:07:38] that passes all understanding and I
[1:07:40] believe that that promise is mine that
[1:07:42] part that portion of the word belongs to
[1:07:45] me yes and I may have been put on a part
[1:07:48] of the land that has a little extra dose
[1:07:51] of anxiety but I'm not going to claim
[1:07:54] that I'm going to over come that devil
[1:07:56] in my land you get it not everybody's
[1:07:59] given the same hardships not everybody
[1:08:00] has the same trials but everybody has
[1:08:02] the same God sir and whatsoever is born
[1:08:05] of God overcometh the
[1:08:08] World by faith good
[1:08:12] Hallelujah see Reuben had to
[1:08:15] overcome his Beginnings to be all that
[1:08:17] he could
[1:08:19] be and it is possible to overcome even
[1:08:22] when your name and birth path hinder you
[1:08:25] right right even when you don't have all
[1:08:28] the advantages
[1:08:30] everything the great example that I
[1:08:32] don't have time to really get into it
[1:08:33] tonight but it was JZ in the scripture 1
[1:08:35] Chronicles chapter 4 the Bible says JZ
[1:08:38] was more honorable than his
[1:08:40] Brethren and it really stands out there
[1:08:43] because just a long list of names just a
[1:08:46] sea of names and then suddenly the
[1:08:48] scripture says Jaz was more honorable
[1:08:50] than his Brethren his mother called his
[1:08:52] name Jaz because I bury him with sorrow
[1:08:54] if you look into that name
[1:08:55] came the sorrow that she's talking about
[1:08:59] may not have been just physical pain it
[1:09:01] may have been that there was something
[1:09:03] that happened and she'd had that baby
[1:09:05] out uh out of the normal way and and
[1:09:10] maybe he was born we would say an
[1:09:12] illegitimate
[1:09:13] child but the Bible says Jaz didn't let
[1:09:16] that bother
[1:09:18] him jabz called on the god of Israel
[1:09:22] saying oh that thou wouldest bless me
[1:09:24] indeed and my Coast so in other words
[1:09:26] I've been given a lot in life his name
[1:09:28] meant
[1:09:29] sorrow my lot is sorrowful I've been
[1:09:32] given this lot but I'm not going to let
[1:09:34] that stop me so he said it's an
[1:09:36] interesting prayer enlarge my
[1:09:38] Coast right let me I don't want somebody
[1:09:41] else's property but let me take all that
[1:09:43] God yeah has given me and that thine
[1:09:47] hand might be with me and that thou
[1:09:48] would us keep me from Evil that it may
[1:09:50] not grieve me and God granted him that
[1:09:52] which he
[1:09:53] requested see ru had some things to
[1:09:56] overcome yes Jacob on his deathbed
[1:09:59] begins to pronounce blessings on his
[1:10:00] children Genesis 49:3 he said Ruben thou
[1:10:04] are my firstborn my might the beginning
[1:10:05] of my strength the excy of dignity and
[1:10:07] the Excellency of power Ruben is doing
[1:10:09] pretty good so
[1:10:11] far well bless the
[1:10:16] Lord then he says unstable is
[1:10:21] water that means like boiling water in a
[1:10:25] pot it's going to come out it's going to
[1:10:26] spill everywhere if the heat isn't
[1:10:29] turned
[1:10:30] down he said Thou shalt not
[1:10:33] Excel because thou wentest up to thy
[1:10:35] father's bed thou defil then defil th it
[1:10:37] he went up to my couch you'll find that
[1:10:39] mentioned in Genesis 3522 how Jacob had
[1:10:42] left bethl and while they were were away
[1:10:45] from the land there's a whole series of
[1:10:47] sermons in that but while Jacob was away
[1:10:49] from the land many bad things begin to
[1:10:51] happen in his family just like when we
[1:10:53] get out of church get from where God
[1:10:55] placed us that's right right and and
[1:10:58] many bad things begin to happen and and
[1:11:01] Reuben committed a terrible sin during
[1:11:04] that time and uh went with one of his
[1:11:07] father's concubines the word unstable is
[1:11:10] literally
[1:11:11] froth
[1:11:13] froth he said you're like boiling water
[1:11:17] uncontrollable it's a dark moment but
[1:11:21] I'm thankful it wasn't the end of the
[1:11:23] story what are you going to do with your
[1:11:25] dark moments come on now what are you
[1:11:27] going to do if you make a mistake come
[1:11:29] on what are you going to do if you make
[1:11:31] a horrible
[1:11:32] mistake right he should have had the
[1:11:34] birth right should have had the blessing
[1:11:37] should have been the the the main guy
[1:11:40] yeah but he couldn't be because of what
[1:11:42] happened what are you going to do with
[1:11:44] that right you you can give in to that
[1:11:47] and just become more like that let that
[1:11:49] overtake your life right but that's not
[1:11:51] what Reuben did right come on are we
[1:11:53] going to accept it or press forward
[1:11:55] forward see and again there's this idea
[1:11:57] that well I'm predestined so whatever
[1:11:59] I'm predestined to be is just going to
[1:12:00] happen and and so I don't need to press
[1:12:03] but look at the sarop phenician woman
[1:12:05] that come to Jesus she was a gentile her
[1:12:08] allotment it wasn't her time yet but her
[1:12:11] daughter wasn't sick in the
[1:12:13] future she was sick right then yes right
[1:12:17] and she come to Jesus and said Jesus how
[1:12:19] son of David and it wasn't her time yet
[1:12:21] brother R said he she had no rights to
[1:12:23] him as son of David yeah and so he said
[1:12:26] it's not meat for me to take the
[1:12:27] children's bread healing and give it to
[1:12:29] dogs
[1:12:32] Gentiles that well a bunch of us would
[1:12:34] have left that church walked away but
[1:12:38] she said I'm not quitting church I'm not
[1:12:40] giving up on God I'm not giving up on
[1:12:43] the gospel I'm not giving up on the
[1:12:44] message because it's hard on me
[1:12:46] personally but she said Lord she said
[1:12:48] even the little dogs eat the crumbs that
[1:12:51] fall from the master's table oh that
[1:12:53] ought to be our attitude tonight
[1:12:56] that was Reuben's attitude evidently he
[1:12:58] was able somehow to overcome this and
[1:13:00] we'll see that in just a
[1:13:02] moment so so the we are not defined by
[1:13:06] the worst thought we ever had yeah or
[1:13:09] even the worst action we ever
[1:13:12] took come on church it's what you do
[1:13:15] with
[1:13:18] that we may bear the consequence of it
[1:13:20] we may bear have scars but even a man
[1:13:23] locked up in prison with a life sentence
[1:13:25] can think on his
[1:13:28] ways that's just the truth of it you say
[1:13:32] well that's just the end then he could
[1:13:33] never be a Christian maybe the only way
[1:13:36] some men would ever be a Christian
[1:13:38] that's
[1:13:39] right you might say you know and looking
[1:13:43] at this in Ruben's particular sin I know
[1:13:46] some of us would look at that and say
[1:13:47] well you know I don't have that problem
[1:13:49] praise
[1:13:51] God I thank God for
[1:13:53] that I'm not like but i' I'd never do
[1:13:56] that but the Bible says all these
[1:13:58] things happened unto them for
[1:14:02] examples and they are written for our
[1:14:04] admonition upon whom the ends of the
[1:14:06] world are come wherefore let him that
[1:14:08] thinketh he
[1:14:09] standeth take heed lest he
[1:14:13] fall Reuben was a type of something this
[1:14:16] is real important I just love the word
[1:14:18] of God how it all fits together in
[1:14:21] Numbers Chapter 2 and verse 10 the Bible
[1:14:24] tells us that the standard of Reuben
[1:14:26] would be on the south side of the camp
[1:14:29] and I think I have a a picture of the
[1:14:33] camp on there and if you look at the
[1:14:36] camp you'll see Reuben on the south side
[1:14:40] and his standard I don't know if you can
[1:14:42] see that but it's the face of a man so
[1:14:44] Reuben's standard is the face of a man
[1:14:47] remember the four living creatures in
[1:14:49] Ezekiel the four living creatures in
[1:14:51] Revelation there's a lion an ox a man
[1:14:56] and an
[1:14:57] eagle right and that was the four powers
[1:15:00] the four the guard of the throne Matthew
[1:15:01] Mark Luke and John right the type well
[1:15:05] if you look at the way the the camp was
[1:15:07] constructed Reuben was the head of three
[1:15:10] tribes of GAD Simeon and Reuben on the
[1:15:13] south side and his his uh his
[1:15:17] identification was a man now brother
[1:15:20] brandom tells us I just love how brother
[1:15:21] brand will drop in a nugget like this he
[1:15:24] said now the Reuben was the man he was
[1:15:27] the first one the first of Jacob's 12
[1:15:30] sons the weakest one of the bunch right
[1:15:33] he was the man he see look a
[1:15:36] son right but he was a man he was a man
[1:15:41] obviously he was a man but what does
[1:15:42] that tell us he's flesh he thinks flesh
[1:15:45] he's
[1:15:46] carnal right and and he's a good type of
[1:15:49] a carnal
[1:15:51] believer that's why we need the Holy
[1:15:53] Ghost are you with me now yes right so
[1:15:57] so he's ruled by his passions he's run
[1:16:00] by the flesh that's what brother BR
[1:16:02] tells us here he said he's the weakest
[1:16:04] one of the bunch he said didn't Jacob
[1:16:05] say so in Genesis 49 Reuben Thou Art the
[1:16:08] first of my strength but like water you
[1:16:10] went up on my couch defile my couch live
[1:16:12] with his father's concubine he said see
[1:16:14] that's the immorals of the human being
[1:16:17] oh that'll never happen to me he said
[1:16:19] that's
[1:16:20] Humanity that's Humanity sir oh I thank
[1:16:24] God for Grace
[1:16:25] yes he said you see the animals don't
[1:16:28] have them the immorals the lion none of
[1:16:29] these things has that but the man did so
[1:16:33] part of overcoming is realizing that you
[1:16:35] are
[1:16:36] flesh you are a man Reuben you're a man
[1:16:40] and if you don't learn to turn down the
[1:16:42] heat your passions will boil over and
[1:16:45] destroy
[1:16:46] you there got to be something that
[1:16:48] controls that so A man is made in such a
[1:16:51] way that only the new birth will
[1:16:52] completely control that so it's why so
[1:16:55] many great men in the Old Testament fall
[1:16:57] in that way David was a man Samson was a
[1:17:00] man just doing what men
[1:17:02] do right but why because they were also
[1:17:05] men of God we look at it and say well
[1:17:08] look but there were many men who acted
[1:17:10] like that they were just acting like men
[1:17:12] acted but they were also supposed to be
[1:17:14] men of God and Men of God aren't
[1:17:15] supposed to act like that Christians
[1:17:17] aren't supposed to act like that so
[1:17:19] brother brandom talks about a lady
[1:17:20] coming down the street twisting herself
[1:17:22] and a curly-headed young man he said was
[1:17:23] a preacher was watching ing her and he
[1:17:26] said that man would look and lust and he
[1:17:29] said there's nothing there to hold him
[1:17:30] from doing that he just does it it's
[1:17:32] just the way men the people do now and
[1:17:34] the women the women dressed in a way to
[1:17:36] make a man do that he said and a man
[1:17:38] will do it they just do it but he said A
[1:17:40] man was born again now he'll still have
[1:17:42] thoughts he's a human being but he looks
[1:17:45] to the Cross he has to fight but if he
[1:17:49] keeps his eye on Calvary he can win that
[1:17:50] fight amen and some of us were born with
[1:17:53] a little extra passion a little extra
[1:17:56] flesh if I can say it that way a little
[1:17:57] extra tune to that and and and maybe the
[1:18:00] potential for that when maybe another
[1:18:02] man wouldn't fight that he'd fight
[1:18:03] something else but most men I'd say
[1:18:05] fight that but we don't have to live
[1:18:08] immorally just because we're men come on
[1:18:11] church at least the sisters ought to say
[1:18:15] Amen right because because we got
[1:18:18] something that'll hold us what he say
[1:18:20] you overcome by the new birth and 1 John
[1:18:23] 2:1 said my children these things right
[1:18:25] unto you that you sin not and if any man
[1:18:28] sin I'm so glad that yes we can make
[1:18:30] mistakes yes we can cater to the flesh
[1:18:32] even ask me listen don't you tell me you
[1:18:34] can't fall right because let him that
[1:18:36] think if he standing to take he lest he
[1:18:38] fall and I remember years ago you know
[1:18:41] sermons will stick with you things
[1:18:42] people say for years and I was sitting
[1:18:44] here as a 16 or 17 year old boy but
[1:18:46] Aaron McGary was standing behind this
[1:18:48] pulpit and he made the statement he said
[1:18:50] if you think he said he said people say
[1:18:52] well he wasn't really standing he said
[1:18:54] well if he thinks he's saying uh
[1:18:56] wherefore let him to think if he say
[1:18:57] take heed lest he fall he said he had to
[1:18:59] be sing or he couldn't fall that's
[1:19:01] right makes sense doesn't it right so
[1:19:05] he's a Christian but he might fall but
[1:19:07] you can't fall away right right God's
[1:19:09] got you he's going to bring you back oh
[1:19:12] I'm glad for the grace of God why we
[1:19:14] have an atonement a propitiation don't
[1:19:16] don't get don't let that ruin your life
[1:19:19] don't let that be the story of your life
[1:19:21] because you made a mistake but he is the
[1:19:23] propitiation aren't you glad for that
[1:19:25] for our sins and not for ours only but
[1:19:27] also for the sins of the world listen we
[1:19:30] are 16 elements of dirt in Ecclesiastes
[1:19:32] 12:7 it said then shall the dust return
[1:19:34] to the Earth as it was and the spirit
[1:19:36] shall return unto God who gave it that's
[1:19:38] our flesh Dust We Are to dust we shall
[1:19:40] return your flesh as far as your flesh
[1:19:41] but the B said it's no different from a
[1:19:43] horse or from a cow or anything else
[1:19:45] it's still just flesh he said boy you
[1:19:48] glorify the flesh but that Spirit has a
[1:19:50] soul in there my brother he said that's
[1:19:52] right but your flesh is just dust of the
[1:19:53] earth like the animal your flesh is no
[1:19:55] more than an animal and if you lust
[1:19:57] after the Flesh and the thing you see
[1:19:58] lust after women lust after all these
[1:20:00] different things it's still animal
[1:20:02] that's right you shouldn't do it he said
[1:20:04] the spirit of God will lead you on put
[1:20:06] you on a higher plane than that oh I say
[1:20:08] let's all come up to a higher plane
[1:20:11] let's let's come up above that we're
[1:20:13] living in an age where we
[1:20:15] can if that'll always be a battle we
[1:20:18] have to fight
[1:20:19] right I don't say that to condemn
[1:20:22] someone who's Fallen I say that to give
[1:20:23] you courage step back to the
[1:20:26] plate if you fall get back up repent but
[1:20:29] aim for for higher
[1:20:31] things in 1 Chronicles 51 it says now
[1:20:35] the sons of Ruben the firstborn of
[1:20:37] Israel for he was the firstborn but for
[1:20:39] as much as he defiled his father's bed
[1:20:41] so there were ramifications for what he
[1:20:44] did he said his Birthright was given to
[1:20:46] the sons of Joseph the son of Israel
[1:20:49] genealogy is not to be reckoned after
[1:20:50] the
[1:20:51] birthright so he's saying that it don't
[1:20:53] match the birthright don't match to
[1:20:55] genealogy because of what happened right
[1:20:58] he said for Judah prevailed above his
[1:21:00] Brethren and out of him came the chief
[1:21:02] ruler but the birthright was
[1:21:04] Joseph's right so there was Joseph had
[1:21:06] the birthright Judah out of him come the
[1:21:09] chief ruler but it should have been or
[1:21:12] we would have thought that it should
[1:21:14] have been Reuben but man's choice not
[1:21:15] always God's
[1:21:16] choice so if you go back in the
[1:21:18] scripture and again I love how it all
[1:21:19] ties together you remember there there
[1:21:22] there there's two men named Dayan and
[1:21:24] aam you remember them if you haven't
[1:21:26] read the scripture maybe you've watched
[1:21:27] the movie you
[1:21:30] know Dayan was a real squirly guy on the
[1:21:33] on the Ten Commandments movie you know
[1:21:35] he just kind of I'm sure you've all your
[1:21:37] good all us good message kids have seen
[1:21:39] that movie you
[1:21:40] know we uh uh I always thought Dayan was
[1:21:44] the best you know the best actor on that
[1:21:47] movie but but Dayan and abam were
[1:21:50] against Moses remember they come under
[1:21:52] Kora Kora was a levite Dayan and abam
[1:21:55] were reubenites and the Bible points
[1:21:57] that out to us that they were of the
[1:21:59] tribe of Reuben and so you can see that
[1:22:03] there's something there that them being
[1:22:05] direct descendants I believe they were
[1:22:06] grandchildren great-grandchildren of
[1:22:07] Reuben is found in De Deuteronomy 11:6
[1:22:10] that the Earth swallowed them up with
[1:22:12] their families intents because they
[1:22:14] refused to come out when Moses told them
[1:22:15] to come out and they said who who made
[1:22:18] you a prince over
[1:22:19] us right now because they were from the
[1:22:22] first family they were from the ones who
[1:22:24] should have been the ones that ruled
[1:22:27] everything huh are you with me now God
[1:22:30] don't just give things like that that's
[1:22:33] not how he does it we we listen to me
[1:22:35] church we he knows who to elect to what
[1:22:39] position and who to put in what place he
[1:22:41] knows and he does it for a reason God
[1:22:43] already knew that Judah out of Judah
[1:22:45] would come David and and out of that
[1:22:47] lineage would come Christ God already
[1:22:48] knew that Joseph would get the birth
[1:22:50] right he already knew that and he wasn't
[1:22:54] he wasn't uh surprised when Reuben fell
[1:22:58] but yet Reuben again it wasn't the end
[1:23:00] of the story for Reuben we like to treat
[1:23:02] Our Heroes as if our heroes never do
[1:23:05] wrong and the bad guys never do
[1:23:09] right come on you've all seen The Lone
[1:23:12] Ranger this is going to be movie
[1:23:14] reference nights you
[1:23:17] know maybe you heard the radio
[1:23:21] show Lone Ranger could never do anything
[1:23:23] wrong he could shoot people they
[1:23:25] wouldn't
[1:23:28] die L Ranger never did wrong and the bad
[1:23:31] guys butcher City whoever was never did
[1:23:33] anything right but that's not the the
[1:23:37] true story of
[1:23:40] humanity even the best of us have two
[1:23:43] dogs fighting in us one good and one bad
[1:23:48] yes the one we cater to the most is the
[1:23:51] one who wins right
[1:23:55] now it's it's fascinating because I
[1:23:57] we've already touched on this in the
[1:23:59] story of Joseph but it was Reuben who
[1:24:01] tried to get Joseph out of the pit you
[1:24:04] remember that in Genesis 37:21 it said
[1:24:08] when they were conspiring to put Joseph
[1:24:10] to death it said Ruben heard it now of
[1:24:13] all the people that should have wanted
[1:24:16] Joseph
[1:24:17] dead Reuben should have been the one
[1:24:19] that wanted him dead because he was the
[1:24:23] firstborn but he didn't want him dead he
[1:24:26] delivered him he was the only one who
[1:24:28] said let's not kill
[1:24:30] him right yeah let's not kill
[1:24:33] him oh my and in verse 22 Reuben said
[1:24:37] unto them shed no blood but cast him
[1:24:39] into this pit is in the wilderness lay
[1:24:41] no hand upon him he may read him out of
[1:24:43] their hands so the Bible's giving us
[1:24:45] Insight that Reuben was going to sneak
[1:24:47] back there and get him out of the pit
[1:24:49] you remember later Reuben comes back and
[1:24:50] Joseph's not there because they sold him
[1:24:53] into slavery and later on when they go
[1:24:56] down there into the and and they find
[1:24:58] Joseph they don't know who he is and
[1:24:59] Joseph begin to speak very harshly to
[1:25:01] them and Reuben tells his brothers he
[1:25:03] said this is what happens this is
[1:25:05] because of Joseph not even knowing
[1:25:07] Joseph was standing there listening to
[1:25:09] him right right but he still had that on
[1:25:11] his conscience yeah come on right but
[1:25:15] you think well Reuben's all bad no he's
[1:25:17] not yeah it's Ruben
[1:25:21] overcoming come on church every one of
[1:25:23] us have to overcome
[1:25:25] something it's Reuben overcoming of all
[1:25:28] Jacob's sons he should have been the one
[1:25:30] who wanted Joseph dead but he stood in
[1:25:31] the gap for
[1:25:33] Joseph Moses knew that God saw it and
[1:25:36] when Moses pronounced the blessing in
[1:25:38] Deuteronomy chapter 33 over each tribe
[1:25:41] look what he says look how different the
[1:25:43] blessing is now he said let Reuben
[1:25:47] live hallelujah oh we always want to
[1:25:50] pronounce a death sentence on people but
[1:25:52] that's not the end of the story let
[1:25:53] Reuben live live and not die let not his
[1:25:55] men Be Few what's he saying he he
[1:25:58] recognized if you show Mercy Mercy will
[1:26:00] be returned to you that's right and God
[1:26:04] had a plan for
[1:26:05] reuben reuben ended up and we actually
[1:26:10] that's just fabulous to me we can just
[1:26:11] dwell on that all
[1:26:13] night but Reuben the tribe of Reuben now
[1:26:16] after Reuben passes away ended up not
[1:26:20] going all the way into the promised land
[1:26:22] along with a couple other tribes we'll
[1:26:23] deal with that again because it's very
[1:26:25] involved but I want to get into a little
[1:26:27] bit of that here as we have just a few
[1:26:28] more minutes before we
[1:26:30] close now the Bible says that when they
[1:26:33] come to the land they come up to the
[1:26:35] Jordan towards the Jordan Reuben had
[1:26:39] been blessed with to be
[1:26:42] Cowboys right Reuben the the PE children
[1:26:45] of Reuben were Cowboys the reubenites
[1:26:48] they had
[1:26:49] cattle and they noticed that it was a
[1:26:51] great flat plane right it was it was
[1:26:54] real nice for
[1:26:56] cattle and so uh you find in in Numbers
[1:26:58] chapter 32 when they saw the land of Jer
[1:27:02] said they had a very great multitude of
[1:27:04] cattle they were successful
[1:27:07] Cowboys and it says that behold the
[1:27:10] place was a place for
[1:27:11] cattle and again remember Reuben is the
[1:27:14] face of a man look a boy right look a
[1:27:18] sun a sun I hope I'm not stretching this
[1:27:21] so far that you can't see it but uh
[1:27:25] look it's it's he's under the that that
[1:27:29] uh the idea Reuben and you'll find this
[1:27:32] he always does what's best for himself
[1:27:34] what's best for
[1:27:36] materially and so they looked at it that
[1:27:38] way and they said well let's why don't
[1:27:39] we just stay here and Moses does an
[1:27:42] interesting thing You' have thought of
[1:27:43] all people Moses said no don't stop
[1:27:45] short you're almost there look that for
[1:27:47] 40 years yeah they talked about going
[1:27:50] into a land flowing with milk and honey
[1:27:53] and they get right to the edge of it and
[1:27:54] they said hey let's stay
[1:27:58] here right it sounds like some some of
[1:28:03] us get right to the edge of it right to
[1:28:06] the time of the Rapture right to the end
[1:28:08] time and they said well you know we're
[1:28:09] pretty comfortable here in
[1:28:12] Leia stay right here not cross over into
[1:28:15] the opening of the word not cross over
[1:28:16] into the things of
[1:28:19] God but now look and there's
[1:28:22] ramifications for that
[1:28:25] Moses told him said you can stay he said
[1:28:28] but you have to fight with us so they
[1:28:30] went and they did that and they
[1:28:31] performed honorably in in the in the
[1:28:33] land in the battles but there was always
[1:28:36] a division between them and the other
[1:28:38] tribes because they didn't go on
[1:28:40] over and let me say this whenever
[1:28:42] there's whenever you cater to carnality
[1:28:45] there will always be division oh my
[1:28:48] right because now you you've catered to
[1:28:51] the Flesh and you stayed on the outside
[1:28:54] of the full promise of God and now
[1:28:58] there's Division and it affects how you
[1:29:00] fight yeah because they went that time
[1:29:03] but after they lived in the land for a
[1:29:04] while you'll find some things begin to
[1:29:07] happen uh brother Brown said they did
[1:29:09] not fully come into the love of God's
[1:29:12] word that ought sober us up tonight they
[1:29:15] didn't fully come into the love of God's
[1:29:17] word so in in Joshua 22 they built an
[1:29:20] altar because they did want their kids
[1:29:22] to know that they were they were doing
[1:29:24] it right they they wanted their kids to
[1:29:26] know that they were Israelites even
[1:29:28] though the rest of Israel was going on
[1:29:29] over they knew they would be separated
[1:29:31] from the tribe but the rest of the
[1:29:32] tribes took offense to it and they and
[1:29:35] and and you'll find it was almost a war
[1:29:38] and it had to be talked out and finally
[1:29:40] The Diplomatic uh people got together
[1:29:42] and War was averted you'll find during
[1:29:45] the time of Deborah and baric and you
[1:29:47] can go find all of these things in the
[1:29:48] scriptures in Judges chapter 5 you'll
[1:29:51] find that during the time of the Prophet
[1:29:52] us Deborah and the and the General baric
[1:29:56] Barack Reuben was one who refused to
[1:29:59] come out and fight yeah why he was on
[1:30:02] the other side of Jordan he had all his
[1:30:05] cattle or by this time
[1:30:06] sheep because in judges 5:16 said why B
[1:30:09] us down among the sheepfolds to hear the
[1:30:11] bleedings of the flocks for the
[1:30:12] divisions of Reuben there were great
[1:30:14] searchings of heart so in other
[1:30:16] words they couldn't just follow when the
[1:30:19] trumpet
[1:30:20] sounded when Barack went and sounded a
[1:30:22] trumpet and said everybody come let's
[1:30:24] make war yeah against the Invaders of
[1:30:26] the land Ruben couldn't follow because
[1:30:28] they had to think about it well I got a
[1:30:30] job I got this I got that I got the
[1:30:32] other
[1:30:34] on right it's
[1:30:37] important we want to go all the way in
[1:30:39] we want to love the word with all of our
[1:30:41] heart yes and you find out later and
[1:30:44] again we'll maybe get back into this
[1:30:45] some other time but they they began by
[1:30:47] hting C cattle and they were shepherds
[1:30:50] by the time of the New Testament they
[1:30:51] kept Hogs yeah on the other side the
[1:30:55] ones that Jesus were Legion was on that
[1:30:58] Jesus went to but I want you to see
[1:31:01] tonight before we close that God is
[1:31:03] faithful yes amen see now when they come
[1:31:08] into the land of promise the land of
[1:31:09] promise is not the
[1:31:11] Millennium it wasn't the perfect place
[1:31:14] it was the place to fight it was a type
[1:31:17] of the Holy Ghost right type of the
[1:31:19] opening of the word a type of the land
[1:31:21] where all the promises lay and and so
[1:31:24] that's where we are is in the land we're
[1:31:27] we're we're we're in there and we got to
[1:31:28] fight but it's not a type of the
[1:31:30] Millennium because in the Millennium all
[1:31:32] wrongs are made
[1:31:34] right so if you go and look in Ezekiel
[1:31:36] and find Ezekiel and I don't have a map
[1:31:39] I don't think with me well I have a map
[1:31:40] of ezekiel's but not the original map
[1:31:42] you'll find that in the original land
[1:31:45] remember Moses allowed them to stay
[1:31:47] completely on one side of
[1:31:49] Jordan but when Ezekiel sees the tribes
[1:31:53] in order in the Millennium he doesn't
[1:31:56] see it that way he sees every tribe
[1:32:00] given an equal
[1:32:02] amount right the the map looks
[1:32:05] completely different I want you to
[1:32:08] understand something tonight many times
[1:32:09] we're placed where we are to fight to
[1:32:12] develop
[1:32:13] character to to to be what God wants us
[1:32:16] to be and God will place you maybe in a
[1:32:18] land where there's lots of sickness or
[1:32:19] in a land where there's lots of
[1:32:21] Heartache or in a land where you got to
[1:32:23] fight uh uh lust maybe or a land where
[1:32:25] you got to fight uh uh anxiety or
[1:32:28] depression God allows you to live there
[1:32:31] yes but he's not going to leave you
[1:32:33] there forever come on there is a place
[1:32:36] all
[1:32:38] right your new body won't fight with
[1:32:41] anxiety in your new body Church you
[1:32:45] won't you won't have to suffer with
[1:32:46] sickness in your new body you won't you
[1:32:49] you won't be placed there sir here you
[1:32:51] fight that but over there you don't
[1:32:55] right and in the Millennium listen in
[1:32:58] Ezekiel 486 by the border of Ephraim
[1:33:00] from the East side to the west side a
[1:33:02] portion for Reuben right in the middle
[1:33:05] right in the promised land oh
[1:33:09] Church oh my brother brandham gives an
[1:33:12] answer about a wife who refused to serve
[1:33:13] the Lord it's a very interesting answer
[1:33:15] because brother brandham said told this
[1:33:17] man said if you have the wrong one now
[1:33:18] you'll have the right one you remember
[1:33:19] the answer you'll be given the right one
[1:33:21] in the Millennium and that's that's kind
[1:33:24] of a strange statement but this proves
[1:33:27] that scripturally think about it because
[1:33:30] whatever tribe maybe ended up not taking
[1:33:32] all their land or or not becoming all
[1:33:35] that they could have been or staying on
[1:33:37] the wrong side of Jordan but in the
[1:33:39] Millennium that's good they come back
[1:33:41] into their place that's
[1:33:44] good now
[1:33:46] look what does that mean brother man
[1:33:48] makes this statement he said you just
[1:33:49] keep on
[1:33:50] going all wrong someone say it with me
[1:33:54] all wrongs will be made right
[1:33:58] there you live with your scars here but
[1:34:01] your scars go away
[1:34:03] there good
[1:34:05] Hallelujah you live with the shame here
[1:34:08] but the shame goes away there you live
[1:34:10] baby with diminished possibilities and
[1:34:12] and maybe even a diminished freedom of
[1:34:14] movement here but not over
[1:34:17] there over there if you're a child of
[1:34:19] God no matter what you did here because
[1:34:22] you're going back to God's original
[1:34:23] thought you're not you're not going to a
[1:34:26] land where you're going to fight anymore
[1:34:28] but you're going to a land of Freedom
[1:34:29] you're going to a land where God what
[1:34:31] God had purposed in his mind for you
[1:34:34] from the foundation of the world where
[1:34:36] you are now is your fighting position
[1:34:38] but over there all maps are redrawn y
[1:34:42] are you with me so far I'm almost ready
[1:34:45] to close that's why Moses didn't just
[1:34:48] make them go on into the land I'm coming
[1:34:50] to something they were pre-ordained to
[1:34:52] be in their in in place you said well
[1:34:55] they chose to be and it was a mistake
[1:34:57] yes it was the permissive will of God
[1:34:59] yes but they were supposed to be
[1:35:02] there yeah now
[1:35:04] look they
[1:35:06] were actually there were actually tribes
[1:35:08] that were supposed to be on the wrong
[1:35:10] side of the river I know that blows our
[1:35:12] minds but God puts everything the way he
[1:35:15] wants it right good I'm not just making
[1:35:19] this up brother brand said he has a
[1:35:21] permissive will he said now there's what
[1:35:23] the trouble lays we try to work on God's
[1:35:25] permissive will and he will permit it he
[1:35:27] said but also if we take his permissive
[1:35:28] will though it's not right we should
[1:35:30] never do that but he said though it's
[1:35:32] not right he will make his permissive
[1:35:34] will to work out together to glorify his
[1:35:37] perfect will that ought give some of us
[1:35:39] faith in Courage and hope
[1:35:41] and though we may not have done it
[1:35:45] right I've only heard one person ever I
[1:35:48] just use this as an analogy because we
[1:35:50] got some young people but I've only
[1:35:51] heard one person ever say that they did
[1:35:53] everything right during their dating
[1:35:55] period or their
[1:35:57] courtship and I have ever since then
[1:36:00] I've had to struggle with a thought that
[1:36:01] maybe they were a
[1:36:07] liar just just how that just keeps
[1:36:10] coming to me you
[1:36:13] know I know some of y'all brother
[1:36:15] Stewart probably did everything right
[1:36:16] you know
[1:36:17] but I
[1:36:19] didn't most of us didn't and that's not
[1:36:21] a license to do thing we want the
[1:36:22] perfect will of God marriage goes so
[1:36:24] much
[1:36:27] better God saved me from a lot of things
[1:36:30] my own
[1:36:32] stupidity are you with me now JT said he
[1:36:35] did he remembers
[1:36:40] me it's a voice of knowledge back
[1:36:45] there God saved me from that I'm I'm
[1:36:48] saying this to to help you because yeah
[1:36:51] you'll make a mistake get up
[1:36:54] huh keep going he says wrongs will be
[1:36:57] made right over there you can't do
[1:36:59] nothing about it why wallow in your
[1:37:01] tears why spend the rest of your life
[1:37:03] defensive about it just let God take
[1:37:05] care put it in the hands of
[1:37:07] God and if you have an opportunity to do
[1:37:09] good like Reuben did do it
[1:37:12] yes if you have an opportunity to show
[1:37:14] Mercy to somebody else because of what
[1:37:16] you've been through do it you never know
[1:37:19] what God might do for you
[1:37:21] yes the say each the land was provided
[1:37:24] and divvied up by inspiration and each
[1:37:26] one he said I could take the scriptures
[1:37:28] and show it to you exactly that he put
[1:37:31] them in the place where they were
[1:37:32] supposed to be positionally listen I
[1:37:35] know some of y'all doubted me on this
[1:37:37] look what he says how that the two half
[1:37:39] tribes was to stay across the river
[1:37:44] yeah some tribes were meant to
[1:37:47] be across the river how that their
[1:37:50] mothers CED that in their birth
[1:37:53] how that each place was supposed to be
[1:37:56] he had it all in control to begin with
[1:37:59] he said now after you're in that don't
[1:38:01] mean that you're out free from war right
[1:38:04] you still have to fight those of you who
[1:38:05] have crossed over those of you who have
[1:38:07] a love for the word you still have to
[1:38:10] fight for every inch of ground you stand
[1:38:12] on so see Canaan did not represent the
[1:38:15] great Heaven because it's war and
[1:38:16] troubles and killings and fightings and
[1:38:18] so forth but it did represent this that
[1:38:20] it must be a perfect walk he said a
[1:38:23] perfect walk because he said Joshua was
[1:38:25] never defeated until achen took his
[1:38:28] wedge of gold and hid it so we got to
[1:38:31] walk before God with a perfect heart and
[1:38:33] a perfect heart just saying Lord
[1:38:34] whatever is wrong with me take it out of
[1:38:36] me cleanse me oh God know my heart know
[1:38:39] the inside of me I want to be right if I
[1:38:42] do so I quickly repent I'm not going to
[1:38:44] hide it I'm not going to grab a hold of
[1:38:46] idolatry I'm going to live for you I'm
[1:38:48] going to do what's right oh church I'm
[1:38:51] so glad that there's a perfect walk that
[1:38:53] we can walk maybe not perfect in the
[1:38:55] eyes of men but in the eyes of God but
[1:38:58] now watch we can't watch what everybody
[1:38:59] else is doing you can't look over your
[1:39:01] shoulder at somebody else's alotment
[1:39:03] saying and despising them because
[1:39:05] they're on the wrong side of the river
[1:39:06] you just take care of your own plot of
[1:39:08] land and take care of your own corn
[1:39:10] don't look at over say well that other
[1:39:11] Church they do it a different way let's
[1:39:13] do it the way God wants us to do
[1:39:17] it for this season for this time for
[1:39:20] such a time as this are you with me
[1:39:23] tonight let's let's do what God called
[1:39:25] us to do said well everybody else does
[1:39:27] it a certain way that don't mean we have
[1:39:28] to do it that way let's do it according
[1:39:30] to the word we want the perfect will of
[1:39:32] God but if you make a mistake if you
[1:39:35] stumble there is an advocate
[1:39:37] propitiation made for
[1:39:39] you God puts them there for a reason God
[1:39:42] put you here for a reason though you may
[1:39:44] be in a difficult land it was a very
[1:39:47] difficult place for them to be because
[1:39:49] they were the very first tribe to be
[1:39:52] invaded every time there was an invasion
[1:39:54] Reuben was invaded first and the first
[1:39:56] one to be lost from history was
[1:40:00] Reuben but that's somehow God meant for
[1:40:03] that or he knew that would take place he
[1:40:07] put them in the spot that they could
[1:40:09] live in they could raise cattle in
[1:40:12] listen we were born in sin by his
[1:40:14] permissive will do you know that every
[1:40:17] one of us are here by permissive will
[1:40:20] unless your parents spoke you into exist
[1:40:22] existence and I don't think I think they
[1:40:25] did every one of us are born by
[1:40:28] permissive will but we are born
[1:40:30] again by perfect
[1:40:33] will because the perfect one
[1:40:36] came died on a cross for our sins
[1:40:40] musicians go ahead and come I'm so glad
[1:40:42] he came we were born again by perfect
[1:40:44] will no matter what your past was no
[1:40:46] matter what you were you were born again
[1:40:48] to sit in Heavenly places in Christ
[1:40:50] Jesus to fellowship with one another to
[1:40:53] love one another to have a perfect walk
[1:40:57] how many would like to say let let me
