We're going to go ahead and have uh Jason and Elijah come up to sing. Homeless world. I want to see things down here ain't got no chains on me. But I'm not worried about the future because I know he's ready to come and I'm ready to go. Well, it seems like everybody's talking about heaven. And if you want to go along, you better be believing. I've got a feeling someday soon we'll be leaving. And if you want to ride this train, you better not be slow. You ready to come? Are you ready to go? He's ready to come. Are you ready to go? Sometimes it seems that everything goes wrong. I just sit around and cry and sing old sad songs. But then he whispers in my ear and he lets me know he's ready to come and I'm ready to go. Well, it seems like everybody's talking about heaven. And if you want to go along, you better be believing. I've got a feeling someday soon we'll be leaving. And if you want to ride this train, you better not be slow. He's ready to come. Are you ready to go? He's ready to come. Are you ready to go? He's ready to come and I'm ready to go. Um, Sister McCen, if you would just go ahead and come up to sing and then uh after that we'll invite our pastor to come. Where would I be. You only know. I'm glad you see Lord through us alone. A hopeless case, an empty place. If not for grace, where would I be? You will know. I'm glad you see love through eyes of love. I'm a hopeless case and empty place. Thank God for grace. Oh precious Lord, take my hand. Oh, lead me on and let me stand. I'm a hopeless place, an empty place. Thank God for grace. Amazing grace. How sweet the sound that saved a rich like me. I once was lost but now I'm found. was blind, but now I see. My chains are gone. I've been set free. My God, my Savior has ransomed me free. And like a flood, his mercy reigns. Unending love. It's amazing grace. Where would I be? You only know. I'm glad you see me through eyes of love. I'm a hopeless place and empty place if not for grace. I'm a hopeless case and empty place. Thank God for grace. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Let's sing that again as we invite our pastor to come. Where would I be? &gt;&gt; You only know. I'm glad you see through eyes of love. If not for grace singing now, where would I be? Oh yes, you only know. Oh, you only see through eyes of love. I was a hopeless case, an empty place, if not grace. Aren't you glad for grace tonight? Amazing grace, how sweet the sound. When you find, if you make it over there, I believe that you will. You find me find me singing, "Amazing grace, how sweet the sound." What brother Brandham said, "Amazing grace." How sweet the sound. Paul says, "By the grace of God, I am what I am." Aren't you glad for his grace today? You're glad for his mercy. Amen. My goodness. I believe his spirit is here tonight. And I'm going to introduce brother Josh Kathy. Brother Josh just moved here and part of the church here with us now, part of our ministry team. And I just I just appreciate them having the confidence to come and I believe it's going they're going to be a big part of what we do here at the church. But brother Josh has got an amazing testimony. I believe he's going to share some of that with us today. And and um you know God has a way of getting you. He's got a way of doing what he does. And I I believe that I believe that there's hope for everyone. And we should just love him for that and thank him for what he's done for us. As brother Josh comes, let's just sing it one more time. Oh, I I was a hopeless case, church. An empty place without form and void, but God rich in mercy. Hallelujah. He found me. Aren't you glad for that? As brother Josh comes, you only know I'm glad you see through eyes of blood. I was a hopeless case. Thank you, Lord. An empty place if not for grace. Amazing grace. Amazing grace. How sweet the sound of glory. Oh, but now I found I was a whole space and empty. If not for grace, where would I be? You only know where would I be. Oh yeah. Heat. Heat. God bless you. Getting the house set up or should I say cadence mostly because when I put something somewhere else. It's kind of like a mule. I'm just hauling it in and let it let it be put where it needs to go. But brother Benny had asked me to speak this evening and um I'd preach here a few other times, maybe a handful of times, but thought it would just be a good opportunity to share my testimony. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To share how that how the light got lit. Brother Brandham said, "If you can't do anything else, just tell somebody how your light got lit." &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. And so I believe I believe that and I believe this message with all my heart. I believe this Bible with all my heart and I it's my absolute. &gt;&gt; And let's if we could let's turn to um Proverbs 13:15. And I didn't um I didn't grow up a Christian. I grew up in this area as many of you might know. Um, but I didn't quite grow up a Christian going to church, anything like that. Didn't didn't know much about the message. Um, so I have kind of a history in this area that I'm not exactly proud of, but I believe it's a part of our testimonies. I believe those those things are, you know, they're not ordained of God to happen in our lives and we get that permissive will sometimes, but I believe it can all be put together in our testimonies as a as an evidence as a as something that we can be not well not proud of, but we can say this is where God came in my life and this is who I was and this is who I am now. &gt;&gt; Amen. And Proverbs 13:15, it says, "Good understanding giveth favor, but the way of transgressors is hard." &gt;&gt; And that'd be the title tonight, the way of a transgressor, which this will be my testimony, but I thought that was a I thought about that scripture and how Brother Brandham had mentioned it many times and it felt like it just fit my life. Um, we could just bow our heads for a moment. Heavenly Father, Lord, we just thank you for another opportunity to come into your house, Lord, to worship your name. And Lord, we just ask that you would be with us in this service, Lord. That you would anoint ears to hear, Lord. That we could just be a help to somebody, Father. That's all we want to be. It's not we're not standing up here for a show. We're not here to here to please anybody else but you, Father. We just want to help one another. And Lord, I believe a testimony that can happen. I believe when you hear what someone's been through, maybe somebody else is going through it, Father, and you know these things. We don't know everything, but we just ask that you would take full control of the service and that you would just have your way in it. In Jesus Christ's name we ask. Amen. Amen. You may be seated. This Proverbs and I'm just going to try and talk as I didn't really want to try and preach a sermon tonight. Um, I just wanted to talk as open and as candid as I could about my testimony. I didn't want to get up here and preach to everybody. And, you know, not exactly, but I just wanted to be open about my life. And if I'm going to be a part of you here and I came up here and I have a history here, I would want the church, if I'm going to be a minister in this church, to know about that firsthand. not not hear it from anybody else, not hear it from because I have to say the other night, brother Ben and brother Joel, they had came over to my house that we moved into and um we were sitting there fellowship in in the living room and and they were they were kind of poking fun at me, but they were saying, "We've heard a few things about you in this area. We we've heard a few things." And I said, "Well, what did you hear?" And I I don't really want to share exactly what they heard, matter of fact, but it it um it made me it made me real I had never realized how um ashamed I was of who I had been. &gt;&gt; Okay. But I never realized how ashamed I was of who I had been. And when when they told me that that night, I had trouble sleeping. I couldn't go to sleep. I thought about it all night. And I was thinking, there just two people in the church. There's a whole church of people here that can talk to anybody and everybody they want to. And so it it just kind of um I was ashamed about it. But the Lord, he as I prayed, he laid some scriptures on my heart and some some thoughts in the scripture and he he kind of comforted me. He let me know that it wasn't for it wasn't without a purpose because that's exactly as brother Ben preached this morning. And if I get emotional talking about it, &gt;&gt; I apologize. But &gt;&gt; good. &gt;&gt; But when he preached this morning, the earth was without form and void. And I would say that's exactly who I was. &gt;&gt; I didn't know my maker. I didn't know I didn't know who I was, &gt;&gt; plainly put. And the enemy, he wants to keep you on that ground. He wants to keep you not knowing who you are. He wants to keep you as far away from Jesus Christ as he can keep you. He doesn't want you to know &gt;&gt; what what's out there per se. &gt;&gt; And something that uh something that had came to my mind, the scripture, the the first one that had came to mind when I was thinking about giving my testimony was was actually just a few Bible characters or or people in the scripture. It was Mori and Hmon. &gt;&gt; And how and how Hmon when Mordei wouldn't bow to him, how how he was just after Mori all the time. He he just wanted what was the scripture doesn't I'm sure tell us that whole story. I'm sure the dayto-day living for Mori was not comfortable &gt;&gt; because he he refused to bow but at that at the and God has a way of doing things. &gt;&gt; He has a way of when the enemy's had his hand on you for so long he has a way of turning it back around on him. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so we get to a point in that story to where Hmon has to be the one I believe it goes that he had to he had to dress Mori &gt;&gt; and he had to will him around through the city. And then you get later on in the story and this would be my testimony right here. You get later on in that story and the the thing that happened was that Hmon had these gallows built &gt;&gt; and his his main thing that he wanted for these gallows right here &gt;&gt; was to hang Morai on them. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And then at the end of that story, he flips the script. And God has a way of coming into our lives, coming on the scene, and flipping the script in our life. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And what he did there was Hmon ended up hanging on the exact gallows that he had built to kill Morai. &gt;&gt; And that's exactly what a testimony is. &gt;&gt; Come on. That's right. &gt;&gt; It's you getting up and telling about those gallows that that had your name on them &gt;&gt; that were meant for you, &gt;&gt; but now &gt;&gt; they're meant for the enemy. &gt;&gt; That's what a testimony is. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; And I apologize for getting emotional. It's &gt;&gt; But I believe God respects that. You know, it shows &gt;&gt; when you get it's not there's nothing wrong with crying about your testimony or crying about what he's done for you. &gt;&gt; It's showing how important it was to you. &gt;&gt; And and that's exactly we we talk about revival a lot in the church. If we want revival, then get alone between you and God and think back to what he did for you. &gt;&gt; Let your mind really go back to everything he's done for you. &gt;&gt; We We talk about power and knowing who we are and all these things. That's all great and I believe it and I believe that was preached. &gt;&gt; Come on. But get alone with God sometimes and think exactly what all you've been through &gt;&gt; cuz the enemy, you know, the me our memory will betray us so much of the time. That channel of memory, it'll betray you. It'll bring these things from the past rushing in. You did this, you did that, and he'll try and bury you under a pile of guilt &gt;&gt; is exactly what he'll do. &gt;&gt; But that channel of memory can also bring to to remembrance all that God has brought you through. I may have been this before, but I'm this now. &gt;&gt; I'm not that anymore. &gt;&gt; I'm not him anymore. &gt;&gt; Because the prophet tells us that's exactly what the enemy wants to do. He wants to get you to doubt your position. And to get you to doubt your position, he's going to bring anything and everything he can against you. &gt;&gt; Like a court case. &gt;&gt; He's going to pull up all this so-called evidence that he has that I guess he I think he does realize it's under the blood, but he's still going to bring it up. He's going to try and bring it before the believer &gt;&gt; and say, "There's no way this person right here, &gt;&gt; cuz you know who you was. There's no way this person right here was redeemable. &gt;&gt; Think about this. Think about when you did this, you did this. Do you think the other people sitting in the church have done that? &gt;&gt; Oh my." &gt;&gt; He'll ask you questions like that. &gt;&gt; Do you think they've ever struggled with that? Brother so and so, they've lived it their whole life. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; They've never had a slip up. But see, that's that's that's presuming. That's venturing without authority. &gt;&gt; We don't know anybody else's life. We've all been through stuff. We all have a testimony. We all have a journey. &gt;&gt; And it's not always the proudest thing. &gt;&gt; The definition of testimony in itself. And I may not very I may not go very long tonight. It's a testimony. I may Brother Ben told me I could go four hours if I wanted. So I might do that or I might go 30 minutes. I don't know. But he preached so long this morning. I don't know how long I should keep y'all. No, I'm just I'm just messing with it. But the definition of testimony, according to Webster, is a firsthand authentification of a fact &gt;&gt; or or in better terms, an evidence. &gt;&gt; And that's exactly what my testimony is to me. It's an evidence. &gt;&gt; It's an evidence that something happened. It's an evidence of that God works today. It's an evidence that the that the blood still works, &gt;&gt; that you can still claim the blood of Jesus Christ and you can be saved from sin. &gt;&gt; That's what my testimony is. And your testimony, it never stops. &gt;&gt; It wasn't just from the point when when you didn't know the Lord till when you knew him. But I'd like to think that my testimony goes on every single day I live. Every step I take, I wanted to add to that testimony. I don't just want to say the Lord saved me and I haven't felt his presence again. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; I want to say he's walked with me every day since that day and he's never left me and he's never forsook me. He's never let the enemy have me. &gt;&gt; But he's walked with me. &gt;&gt; He's held me when I couldn't stand up. &gt;&gt; He's the footprints in the sand. &gt;&gt; When I couldn't walk, he walked for me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. But these testimonies, they're very I I believe we should have more testimony services. &gt;&gt; I believe they're important. I believe they're encouraging. The prophet said, &gt;&gt; he he was speaking in the message here, the world has fallen apart and it the world has fallen apart. I think a week before that there had been a lot of testimony services and he had went to them and he had listened to these men uh tell their testimonies and this is what he had to say about he said certainly a grand privilege to be here to be hearing these fine testimonies from these brothers that's in love with our lord Jesus he said now I still live on the he said what would I say the inspiration I received from their messages &gt;&gt; he received the the prophet of God received inspiration from these men's testimonies &gt;&gt; you think just a testimony. It wasn't some deep theological sermon. It It wasn't something groundbreaking. It wasn't something on the seals, something on the on whatever it may be. &gt;&gt; No, but he received inspiration. What he received inspiration from was sincere hearts crying out, was sincere hearts telling a story about what they had been through. &gt;&gt; That's what he was receiving inspiration from. And that that's what God looks for so much of the time is a sincere heart that he can work with. that that's the point I believe that I had to get to. &gt;&gt; And my testimony is when when I had I I grew up not going to a whole lot of church. I didn't I'd maybe been to church 10 times in my whole life, I would say, if I was guessing up to the point where I when I heard the message or came back to church. And as I was growing up, I I drank, I smoked, I I did everything somebody could do. I did too much. I did things that I wasn't big enough to be doing. And so, as a story goes, um, as time goes on, I end up going to college and I and I play baseball in college. And while I'm playing baseball in college, I have an invitation to go to Wyoming and continue playing. And I go up to Wyoming and I get in a collegiate baseball league there. And as I'm playing, you know, I'm I I had told this at the church in Arizona before I left. I had talked about the power of transformation. And brother Benny, I think he had read some quotes from it this morning, but I told them, I am a believer in the power of transformation. If there's anybody that tells me that God still can't transform, I would have a problem with that because I believe I'm a I'm a standing testimony of that, that God still has that power to transform somebody in their lives. &gt;&gt; And when he was he God started working on me when I was up there, and what I I believe it was is he was done chasing me. I I had shared with somebody the other day my whole life everywhere I had went and I had worked I was surrounded by the message somehow. I had worked for brother Paul Brewer and there and I had my my grandma my whole life growing up she had the pillar of fire picture in her home and I never asked any questions and I just what I thought that was when I because I knew brother Paul was a a good man. I realized that about him. &gt;&gt; And I I went in his home one time and I saw the same Pillar of Fire picture there that was in my grandma's house. And I remember thinking, well, this must just be what all church folks have. They must all have that picture. I didn't know anything about Baptist or Methodists or Presbyterian or Catholics or anything like that. When I saw the picture, in my mind, it just represented somebody that was a pretty good person that they went to church regular. That's what I thought it was in my mind at that point. But so I was in this collegiate league in Wyoming and and God, I believe, had got to a point where he was done chasing. And it it'll get to that point sometimes. Sometimes you'll only be left with two doors in your life that you can walk through that you can accept it or you can deny it. And he had got tired of chasing me. And I had got to a point in in um in Wyoming there that that I I kind of just had a come aart, I would call it. My my mind I I borderline thought I was going crazy, you know. I I lost I lost my mind is what I would say. I remember being at a and I I'll I'm going to if we got time I'm going to get open and &gt;&gt; get vulnerable with you for a minute. But I remember being at a gas station and we were pulled in the gas station and all we were all in a single cab truck about four of us sitting in there and I was driving and they ran in and I asked them to get me a pack of cigarettes. Said, "Hey, will you guys get me some cigarettes out of there?" And I I was sitting in that truck and right when I said that a a physical feeling came over me of fear and dread and anxiety and and it rushed through my body and I didn't know what it was. So I opened the truck door and I got out of the truck and I was standing there for a minute and I had no idea what was happening to me &gt;&gt; and I I I lost u I don't know how to put it. I lost like consciousness of myself and the next thing I know I'm standing in a road. I'm standing out in the middle of a road. There's cars moving. There's cars going. And I find myself standing right there in that road. And I remember I went back to the truck and I called my mom right away. And I didn't know what was going on. And I tried to describe it, what I was feeling, and I I did the best I could to talk about it. And I I didn't know what it was. And at that we we were staying with I was staying at the coach's home of the team and we had went back to the house and I tried to sleep that night. didn't sleep at all that night and this this anxiety and this dread was just hanging over the top of me and I I kept calling my mom and this was 15 hours from Dyresburg, Tennessee where they were living at or still living right now. And we just decided the best thing to happen was that I would come home or I would I would try and make it to Dyresburg. And that's a 15-hour drive. And so I start feeling this way and I I can't describe the feeling to you. If anybody's ever felt anxiety, anxiety is fear driven. And what anxiety is is you're you're scared of something that you don't even know what you're scared of. It's it's irrelevant. It's it's it doesn't make any sense type of fear. &gt;&gt; It's just a a dread and a nervousness that comes over you for no anxiety. And I've been told by uh older folks that that used to not you didn't hear anxiety, all this problems with anxiety and things like that. But what anxiety is to me is a is a scare tactic of the enemy. It's something that he places on somebody. &gt;&gt; But I believe I had gotten to a point where the Lord took a step back and took his hand. I believe he kept me and protected me &gt;&gt; before I ever accepted him. &gt;&gt; I believe he kept his eye on me because he knew where he's the alpha and the omega. He knew where I was going to end up at &gt;&gt; and I believe he kept me. I remember times when my friends would be doing things that I thought was a little bit too far and he would keep me in certain moments like that. There's times where I believe that I was supposed to be dead. I have flipp here the I don't know what the road's called but the the road on Pocahontas in between where Pocahontas is and when you get off um the road taking you to Jonesboro in between there I rolled a truck a truck with 37in tires big tall truck and I rolled it and I there was a covert like this in the road one of them that did a lot of water rushes through and I hit that with my truck and went over it and landed on the other side. You can't explain things like that. You can't explain why you were kept. &gt;&gt; But he kept you. He He kept us when we were unredeemable. It seemed when we were Don't Don't Don't Don't be confused when these trials and things happen to you. But all that means is that he's got confidence in you that you can make it through it because he had to ordain it in the first place. &gt;&gt; He had to give permission. Yes, this can happen because he believes in you. &gt;&gt; He if you're if you're his bride, he believes in his bride. I trust my wife. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; I trust her fully for anything. And that's the exact relationship right there. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; He trusts us. And so I get back home and it it it doesn't seemingly get any better. And I would say two weeks go by and after the two weeks that went by, uh this was this was nights of I was a 22year-old grown man at this point. And I I was sleeping in the bed next to my mom. &gt;&gt; You can laugh if you want. It wasn't funny then, but I was a grown man sleeping with my mom because I couldn't I couldn't stand to be alone. I would wake up screaming at night and tell her to pray out loud for me. &gt;&gt; And she'd put her hand over on me and pray out loud. &gt;&gt; And those things got me through. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Cuz that God was coming back on the scene. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. But after a couple weeks of that, nothing getting no better. I um my grandma at the time, she knew brother George Moore. He had a church in Troy, Tennessee. And I had just went to my grandma and I said, "I want to be baptized." Cuz I didn't I still didn't know anything. Still hadn't read my Bible. Still hadn't nothing. Um I just knew that I had felt a God that was real up to that point. Yes. &gt;&gt; And uh so I tell my grandma I want to be baptized and in my head when I got baptized when they were going to take me and they were going to dunk me under that water and bring me back up. What was going to happen is it was going to wash away all my troubles &gt;&gt; and that I could go back to living the life that I really wanted to live. &gt;&gt; I didn't want to live this way. I I wanted to go back to doing what I was doing before. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I shared with the church here in Phoenix that uh or in Dwey, Arizona that a month before I met Kaden and brother George and sister Brandy and all them a month before that I was I was in a bar, a dive bar with a picture of beer in front of me with a cigarette in between my fingers. And so that's what I mean. I I know there's a God of transformation. I know there's a God that can take that can take a piece of clay that's without form and without void and that he can make something of it. He can give it direction. He can give it purpose. &gt;&gt; He can start pressing on it in certain ways and get it to mold into what it needs to be. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; So, I know if somebody comes up to me and tells me that God doesn't work in that way anymore, I know that's not true. &gt;&gt; If the enemy tells me that, I know that's a lie &gt;&gt; because I'm a I I've experienced it. &gt;&gt; I've had an experience of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so I go and I I I go to brother George's church there and I walk in Sunday in a t-shirt and some jeans and he calls me back to his office and he calls me back to his office and I sit in his office with him and he says, "So uh how do you put it?" He he might have said, "So how do you know about the message? How what do you know about the message? How'd you hear about it?" They're just asking me questions about the Bible, too. And and I said, "Oh, I know the message. I know. I know." Because I'm thinking, man, if I can just get out in front of this guy, he can baptize me. I can go back to doing what I was doing. You know, I can get back to living the life I want to live. And I'm being open with you. These are the thoughts I had. &gt;&gt; And so he talks to me a little bit longer. And why he agreed to baptize me, I'll never know. But I I go back out and I sit he preaches and I sit through the service. And after the service, well, actually, I left out a little a detail in there. Um, as I go out of his office and I'm sitting in the back, I see a girl playing the violin up on the front and I'm looking at her and I'm thinking, "Man, she's pretty." And turns out that was my wife. And so this random church that I had just walked into, didn't know anywhere. I I had asked my grandma to contact somebody to baptize me. Didn't know what that meant. Um, I look up there and I had the I I'll say this. I I had never I had never and this is shameful. I had not looked up till that point in my life. I had not looked at women in a in a in a way that's I I don't know how to put that. I had not looked at women in a good way. &gt;&gt; You know, if if you catch what I'm saying, we're in a church setting. I don't want to. &gt;&gt; Um, but I looked at her and there was something about her and she she never liked it when I when I used to tell her that. She'd say, "You think I was pretty?" And I said, "No, it wasn't that, but there was something different about you. &gt;&gt; There was something when I looked at you, I saw something different." &gt;&gt; And and &gt;&gt; I don't know if people believe in this or not, but I think I loved her &gt;&gt; from the &gt;&gt; from the first time I seen her. go. &gt;&gt; This is turning me into a big baby. I wasn't planning on all this. Um, but I after the service, I went out and I I had gotten baptized and I I went out and um I was riding with my mom and my grandma home and I told them in the car that I was going to marry her. I told them directly. I mean, I had all this trouble going on. I didn't know which way was up. I didn't know who I was half the time. I I was losing my mind it felt like and and I I looked at him and I said, "I don't know who that girl was, but I'm gonna marry her." &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; And so then you fast forward, I don't know what it was after that, eight months later and we were married. And just uh just thinking about God's hand on my life. I didn't I didn't deserve to meet those people that I met. &gt;&gt; Some of the best people I've ever met in my life. Come on. &gt;&gt; I didn't deserve to have a wife like that. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I didn't deserve any of that. But as brother Ben read about, a God who is rich in mercy &gt;&gt; thought me fit to have that kind of a life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. thought me fit a a dreadful sinner &gt;&gt; who had done nothing but live against him for 22 years of my life. He thought and had enough love towards me &gt;&gt; to give me that. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; And how we should thank him every day if you're sitting here healthy with a family and you got a wife and you've got kids and you got good people, a good church, good people in your life. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; How thankful we should be. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; How we should give our all to him. Yes. &gt;&gt; Never hold back. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; But I'll say this to the youth maybe. You know, sewing sewing my oats as I did early in my life and and as I've heard some people say, getting my testimony &gt;&gt; that'll leave scars on you. &gt;&gt; Those are scars you don't want any part of. &gt;&gt; Those are those are those scars lead to that channel of memory. things you can remember that that the enemy will just hold over your head. The best testimony a young person could have is that I lived for him &gt;&gt; all of my life. &gt;&gt; I never strayed away. If you do stray away, it's okay anyway. God has grace for that. I'm not saying it's okay to sin and be and and go against his word. But don't I don't want to I don't want to preach that like if you do go astray &gt;&gt; that that you're gone and you're falling away. Come on. Come on. &gt;&gt; That's not the truth either. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; But the best testimony you can have as a young person is that I've lived for him my entire life. &gt;&gt; I've had slip ups here and there, sure, but I have lived my life for Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; That's a beautiful testimony. If I could go back in time, &gt;&gt; I would want that to be my testimony. I appreciate some of the things I look back now. I appreciate them because they made and they molded me in certain ways. But I would want that to really be my testimony is that I've lived all of my life for him. &gt;&gt; There you go. &gt;&gt; Romans 8:26 through31 says, "Likewise, the spirit also helpeth our infirmities. For we for we know not what we should pray for as we ought." &gt;&gt; That was me. &gt;&gt; I didn't know what I should pray for. &gt;&gt; I didn't know what I needed, but God knew what I needed. &gt;&gt; Come on. Amen. &gt;&gt; And sometimes we got to trust him a little bit more than what we do to know that what we're going through right now is exactly what we need and it's exactly in his plan. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And that he is still in control. Says, "But the spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings &gt;&gt; which cannot be uttered. And he that searchth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the spirit because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God." when I couldn't make intercession, when I couldn't do anything, he made the intercession. He came on the scene, &gt;&gt; he proved himself out, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And you know what? When after I got baptized, Brother George, he's told me, he said, "I I thought I'd never see you again. I thought you'd come that week and I'd never see you again." But I came back and I kept coming back. It might have been because it might have been because of a pretty girl at first, but it didn't stay that way. It it always was because of a pretty girl. But that that I the the reason became dualfold after that &gt;&gt; after I started seeing what the truth is &gt;&gt; after my eyes started opening because when I came I was a skeptic. I I came into a group of people and they were saying there's this prophet that had came and and they were just telling me I should trust what he said. And I didn't know about that at first. And anything in this book right here in any of these tapes, I believe he will show it forth. Amen. &gt;&gt; But we got to have that sincere heart. You know, that's something I've been reading a book on the Isuzu Street Revival. And if there's one thing that I can, it's a it's a eyewitness testimony of this man that had sat with the the saints that were in that service. And if there's one thing that I've noticed about those people right there is they had sincere hearts. They they may have been met you their main doctrine at Isuza Street was that speaking in tongues is the evidence. And now we all know that's not the case. &gt;&gt; We're aware of that. &gt;&gt; But they had sincere hearts. Anyways, I it was so interesting to me that despite that despite that that large doctrine being a mess in that place, God still moved in mighty ways amongst those people. Isn't that something? &gt;&gt; So you're telling me it's, you know, when God when he first came into my heart, he didn't check me first to see if my doctrine was perfect. &gt;&gt; What he checked was the condition of my heart. That's what he checked &gt;&gt; he checked to see can I work with this guy right here and that's exactly it you know that book has it has rebuked me &gt;&gt; because we claim to be who we are &gt;&gt; and we don't see half the stuff those people saw the the spirit of God don't move half as much &gt;&gt; and I don't I'm rebuking myself here I'm talking to me right now but that book has been an open rebuke those people had something that was wonderful what was taking place there. But it wasn't all about their doctrine or having the perfect doctrine, but it was that hard. Now, brother, I I don't want to I want to bring balance to that because brother Brandham did say, "Now we have to come to full doctrine." He did say that. He said, "The times of dancing on the bubbles, we've had enough of that." &gt;&gt; He said, "Now we have to come to full doctrine." So, it's not a it's not a one-sided thing because if you start going this way, you can fall off over here. Start going over here, you fall off over here. But the highest point of the road is the center. There's a balance there to it. &gt;&gt; We we can't we we don't need to stifle the moving of the spirit. &gt;&gt; But it's not always just about that. &gt;&gt; Verse 28 says, "And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God." That's my testimony &gt;&gt; to them who are called according to his purpose. The prophet says here in my life story, he said, 'The way of a transgressor is hard. He said remember that when God calls you, go on. No matter what anybody says, you serve God. &gt;&gt; No matter no matter what any of the youth think, if you've got friends in the youth, no matter what any of them think, if God calls you, &gt;&gt; if there's a deep out there, calling to a deep in here, if he starts calling your heart, &gt;&gt; you go. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't put it off. Don't wait for another Sunday. Don't wait for another Wednesday. Don't Don't wait till your favorite preacher comes to town. Victoria, by the way, she told me I was her favorite preacher. So, not her dad, not her uncle. It's me. I'm proud of that. That was a first for me. I've never been somebody's favorite preacher. But it's important when God calls to adhere to that calling. And that's what I had to recognize. That's what that was in my life. It was he he had he hadn't put me through it, but he had allowed me to go through the hardest time in my life so he could bring me to to the truth. So he could bring me to the purpose that he had me set on this planet for. &gt;&gt; So he could make and he could mold me and get me to where I needed to be. Another scripture that came to mind when I was thinking on my testimony is Psalm 51:es 10-17 says, "Create in me a clean heart, oh God, and renew a right spirit within me. &gt;&gt; Cast me not away from thy presence, and take not thy holy spirit from me. Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation, and uphold me with thy free spirit." Said, then will I teach transgressors thy ways. That verse 13, that might be something that we let slip past sometimes. After you've done this for me, Lord, then will I teach transgressors thy ways, and sinners shall be converted unto thee. Deliver me from blood guiltiness, oh God, thou God of my salvation, and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness. That's all a testimony is. This is somebody singing aloud of his righteousness coming into their life, &gt;&gt; of him correcting them, of him making them what they need to be. Oh Lord, open thou my lips and my mouth experience. When I brought my broken spirit to him, &gt;&gt; when I brought my broken heart to him, &gt;&gt; he did not despise it. &gt;&gt; When I handed when I handed all the broken pieces of me over to him, you know, God's not just in the patchwork. He doesn't just do patchwork, but he makes it new. He restores it. He makes it what it was in the very beginning. &gt;&gt; He takes it all the way back. We don't we don't serve a God who's in the who doesn't who does patchwork, I guess, is the right word for it. &gt;&gt; But oh God, thou wilt not despise. I guess if the musicians could come up, I just had a another quote or two, maybe a scripture to read. And you know, this is this may be a quote for some of the youth or actually I've I've learned that a lot of the stuff that when I think it's youth oriented when I'm studying or when I'm getting quotes or scriptures together, I've learned that I need it, too. &gt;&gt; I I get into it and I think, "Wow, I've let that slip. I've let that go a little too far. I need to get back to the basics myself." &gt;&gt; Sometimes we need a refreshing. No matter how simple it is, &gt;&gt; no matter it's not always the deep stuff. Sometimes it's the simple stuff. &gt;&gt; Getting back to the basics, &gt;&gt; you know, my prayer started to change. It started to turn into, "Lord, let me just be more like you." &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; I'd got to a point where I I knew I couldn't do it myself. I knew I couldn't transform me. But it was, "Lord, just let me be more like you." &gt;&gt; And becoming more like him, it's not just a one-day process. It's not just a week process, a month, but it's it's a lifelong process to be made and to be molded into the image of Christ. And this quote, it it rang true to me when I read it. He said, "Now that little orange tree said, if it's under now, when you plant it out, maybe when you get it, it's a little a little sprig about so big." He said, "Now you plant it." He said, "Now that's all you have to do to it." He said, 'You don't have to go and say, 'N now I've got to get me some oranges somewhere and go to dumping into it. The oranges is already in it. The only thing that little tree has to do, &gt;&gt; come on, &gt;&gt; you have to keep plenty of water on it. And then the only thing the tree has to do is drink. And it drinks and it drinks till it drinks over its amount. And as it drinks, it pushes out limbs. &gt;&gt; And it drinks more. And it pushes out leaves. It drinks more. It pushes out blossoms. It drinks more. It pushes out oranges. He said, "Just drink and push. Drink and push." He said, "And that's you." When we are planted together in Christ, the only thing we have to do is drink from his promise and push out. &gt;&gt; Everything that you have need of is in you when you receive Christ cuz Christ is in you. You know, for a long time there, I I tried I still continued having having struggles and I was trying to make myself better. But when I when I truly and this is such a simple statement, but when I laid it all down to Christ, when when everything was on the table, when I didn't leave anything to myself, &gt;&gt; that's when he started really moving on the scene for me. &gt;&gt; And let God work quietly in your life. Come on. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Listen, as a prophet tells us, for that little still small voice, &gt;&gt; listen for that direction, which way to go, what to do. Let him make you and let him mold you. Lord, &gt;&gt; be patient with him as he's been patient with you. &gt;&gt; He's shown a lot of patience to me in my life. Be patient back with God. He's working on both ends. Whatever it may be, I don't know what it is. I can't see in the your lives, but whatever it is, I can I can assure you he's working on both ends. And it's working to your good. &gt;&gt; It's working to his purpose in your life. Colossians 3 1-4 says, "If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ siteth on the right hand of God. Set your affection on things above, not on things of the earth. For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God." That's my testimony now. All that stuff before earlier, that was my testimony. But my testimony now is that my life is hid in Christ. &gt;&gt; And he's my keeper. He's my savior. And he's done everything for me. &gt;&gt; And I want to serve him the rest of my days. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Says, "When Christ who is our life shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory." &gt;&gt; And that's my future testimony. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; That's what's coming. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. If that's your testimony, raise your hand tonight. &gt;&gt; If you know that's what's coming for you, if you know you've been through a lot, but he's guided you every step of the way, &gt;&gt; praise him tonight. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Sing out to him. &gt;&gt; Thank him. Thank you, Lord. A clean holy heart, oh Lord God, and renew arise spirit within me. Oh, cast me not away from the pres. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. Take not thy holy spirit from me. Restore unto me the joy of life salvation. Every new arise spirit within me. Oh create me the king of oh God. and renew a spirit within me. Now create me a clean heart. Oh God, and renew the right spirit within me. See, oh cast me not away from thy presence. Oh, take not thy holy spirit from me. must restore all to me the joy of thy salvation and renew arise spirit within me. &gt;&gt; Amen. You appreciate the presence of the Lord tonight. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. What a testimony that was. &gt;&gt; You know, uh, Sunday evening, a lot of time you're struggling to to stay awake, but you know that I didn't see anybody struggling at all. What a powerful testimony that was. You know, we all we all have a little bit different background. We all came from, you know, different places. is we all have a different testimony, but the main thing is is being changed from what you were to what God can make you. And and that's the thing, you got a testimony. You've got to have a testimony. But there's an experience. And when when God comes on the scene, the presence of God when you first felt him, that's what changes a person's life. That's what begins to soften a person's heart to where you can receive what God's trying to do in your life. &gt;&gt; And what do you have to do to that? You have to surrender to that. &gt;&gt; It's a work of the Holy Ghost. It's the grace of God that comes upon a person's life, not just to make them a religious person, but to change their life. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I we just so appreciate the presence of the Lord here tonight. I appreciate what our brother had to say. You know, if tonight, if you if you you have that on your heart to surrender to him, now is the time. The presence of the Lord is here. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a predestinated moment. It was a predestinated moment for this brother to meet the people that he did. He hadn't heard the things that most of you young people have heard your entire lives. &gt;&gt; But there was a predestinated moment. And when that happens, that's God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when he comes on the scene, when he begins to move, surrender to that. Amen. Let's sing that song tonight. I surrender. I'll try to sing it. I surrender. I surrender. Oh, I surrender. &gt;&gt; Lord, I surrender my life. All right. I give it all to you. I surrender. I surrender, &gt;&gt; Lord. I surrender my life. Oh, I give it all to you.
