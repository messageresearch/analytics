[29:17] amen do you believe that amen just
[29:20] looking forward to what god has in store
[29:22] for us tonight
[29:23] and if you would turn with me in your
[29:24] bibles if you can or up on the screen
[29:26] second peter
[29:27] we'll begin reading second peter chapter
[29:29] one
[29:30] amen just good to be in the house of
[29:32] lord this evening
[29:34] amen just hope something said tonight
[29:37] amen that would be
[29:38] a blessing to you i'd like to speak if i
[29:41] could
[29:42] on our time amen this is
[29:46] this is our time this is what we've been
[29:48] called for this is what god has
[29:50] predestinated us to
[29:51] and and we've got to take a stand amen
[29:55] amen i had to i had mattie take some
[29:57] notes the other day while brother ben
[29:58] was preaching and
[29:59] he wrote down two two little sentences
[30:01] and i don't remember what day this was
[30:03] but it was answer the message and answer
[30:05] the hour so
[30:06] kind of gave me a little inspiration uh
[30:08] for tonight amen just uh
[30:10] i believe you know we've heard the
[30:11] message but we've got to do something
[30:13] about it it's okay to identify the
[30:14] message but we've got to identify
[30:16] ourselves in that message amen
[30:18] amen besides this we'll begin reading
[30:20] verse five and besides this
[30:22] giving all diligence add to your faith
[30:24] virtue and divert you
[30:25] knowledge into knowledge temperance and
[30:27] to temperance patience
[30:29] and to patience godliness and to
[30:31] godliness brotherly kindness and to
[30:33] brotherly kindness charity
[30:34] for if these things be in you and abound
[30:36] they make you that you shall
[30:38] neither be barren nor unfruitful in the
[30:40] knowledge of our lord jesus christ
[30:42] but he that lacketh these things is
[30:44] blind and cannot see afar off
[30:46] and hath forgotten that he was purged
[30:48] from his old sins
[30:49] wherefore the rather brethren give
[30:51] diligence to make your calling and
[30:53] election sure
[30:54] for if you do these things you shall
[30:56] never fall i believe that's every
[30:58] believer's
[30:59] desire and heart is not to fail the lord
[31:00] but to go through faithful amen
[31:03] if we could just let's bow our heads
[31:05] just at the reading of the word and just
[31:06] say a word of prayer before we start and
[31:09] maybe if you have an unspoken request
[31:10] why don't you just make it known by
[31:11] lifting a hand amen that god will just
[31:13] speak to you tonight
[31:15] lord i pray god you just come and just
[31:16] use me tonight lord i pray you move me
[31:18] aside lord and i just
[31:19] just render myself my spirit my soul my
[31:21] body to you tonight
[31:23] god that you just come and speak to your
[31:24] children lord you see the needs of the
[31:26] people
[31:27] or i pray that something to be said to
[31:28] bless them and just encourage them along
[31:30] their way
[31:31] or just something that be said just to
[31:32] make their their journey just a little
[31:34] bit easier and
[31:35] god i pray you just bless the people who
[31:37] couldn't come tonight lord if there be
[31:38] any sick lord i pray that just while the
[31:39] word comes forth
[31:41] or the healing power would go with it as
[31:42] well in jesus christ's name we pray
[31:44] amen amen you can have your seeds
[31:48] amen so i just want to speak just for a
[31:49] few moments just on our time and
[31:52] identifying you know you know that this
[31:54] is our time to be the manifested sons
[31:56] and daughters of god
[31:57] is that right so we see that daniel had
[31:59] what it take
[32:00] had what it took to overcome but he
[32:02] didn't actually express that until he
[32:04] was thrown in the lines then is that
[32:05] right and
[32:06] it seems like in this day you know we've
[32:07] known that the word would overcome
[32:09] anything that satan would throw at it
[32:11] we know that the word would overcome
[32:13] anything that the world could do
[32:14] and now it's in this day we're actually
[32:17] seeing the worst that the world has ever
[32:18] been
[32:19] but the word will overcome is that right
[32:22] so brother branham says in the reproach
[32:23] of the cause of the word he says and god
[32:25] sets a time and he has a purpose for
[32:27] everything he does
[32:29] there's nothing that happens
[32:30] accidentally to those who love the lord
[32:32] and are called to his calling
[32:34] so everything that happens in our life
[32:36] god has foreordained that and set a plan
[32:38] for that to happen in our lives amen
[32:40] we are predestinated and everything
[32:42] works just right for that
[32:44] because he cannot lie now as believers
[32:47] everything we've been through we say
[32:48] well it didn't really work right but it
[32:49] works the way god needed it to work not
[32:51] the way we needed it to work amen
[32:53] he said so and that's everything has its
[32:55] time and its season
[32:57] and it has its way and god is behind
[32:59] every move are you thankful for that
[33:01] this evening
[33:02] and sometimes you think that everything
[33:04] is going wrong
[33:05] he said it's up to us those things are
[33:07] put upon us trials and wonderings it's
[33:09] testing
[33:10] to see how we we will react to an action
[33:13] so we see that everything god does is he
[33:15] does for a purpose to make us
[33:17] either better christians or he's
[33:19] purifying the goal he's taking
[33:20] everything out of us that's wrong
[33:22] to create something in us that's good is
[33:24] that right
[33:25] now this uh this word manifest it means
[33:28] to render or apparent or declare so
[33:30] to manifest is to bring something on the
[33:32] inside and reveal it on the outside amen
[33:35] now second corinthians 4 8 it says we
[33:37] are troubled on every side yet not
[33:39] distressed we are perplexed but not in
[33:40] despair
[33:42] persecuted but not forsaken cast down
[33:44] but not destroyed
[33:45] always bearing about the body of the
[33:47] dying of the lord jesus that
[33:49] in that the life also of jesus might be
[33:51] made manifest
[33:53] in our body so we see that the life that
[33:55] was in christ
[33:56] now has to be made manifest in our life
[33:58] amen it's no longer
[34:00] i'm expressing alan or i'm expressing
[34:01] this it's i'm expressing
[34:03] christ amen is that right in the flesh
[34:05] and so we see that something has to
[34:07] manifest itself in our life what's on
[34:09] the inside
[34:10] must show and in this day in this
[34:12] harvest time and harvest season the
[34:14] seventh hour
[34:15] it's the time of the revealing of the
[34:16] fruits is that right it's time for the
[34:17] wheat to show what it actually is the
[34:19] tares
[34:20] have been separated the wheat is showing
[34:22] what it is so if you look at
[34:23] if you look at your life and you're
[34:24] manifesting something that's not of
[34:26] christ then you have something wrong on
[34:28] the inside is that right
[34:29] i mean the scripture says by their
[34:31] fruits you shall know them if i walk up
[34:32] to an apple tree and it has apples on it
[34:34] i know that's an apple tree
[34:35] i don't say well that's an orange tree
[34:37] that's why i don't walk up to to message
[34:39] people and if they're living wrong
[34:40] living in sin doing this
[34:41] gossiping causing trouble i don't walk
[34:43] them and say those are christians
[34:44] because that's not
[34:45] the life of christ is that right amen do
[34:47] you love the lord
[34:49] amen do you know the the song everybody
[34:51] will be happy over there you know
[34:53] the reason it it says that is because
[34:54] all the the gossip the bad things will
[34:56] not be over there amen
[34:58] amen do you love the lord this evening
[35:01] amen so
[35:02] verse 11 for we which live are always
[35:04] delivered unto death for jesus sake for
[35:06] that the life of christ
[35:07] might be made manifest in our mortal
[35:09] flesh
[35:10] so we see that that you know we we
[35:12] always look at the flesh and we say well
[35:13] we're not good enough this isn't good
[35:15] enough but that life that was in christ
[35:17] has to be made manifest in this day
[35:19] through our flesh is that right
[35:21] i know if god's gonna move if god's
[35:23] gonna speak i want it to be through me
[35:25] is that right if he's gonna use
[35:26] anybody in this hour i want him to use
[35:28] me in whatever way he sees fit
[35:31] i believe that we ought to you know he
[35:32] doesn't it's not that god it requires
[35:35] our praise but he deserves our praise is
[35:37] that right he deserves our worship then
[35:39] in this day when it's the darkest hour
[35:41] that's when we need to praise him the
[35:42] most
[35:43] is that right we see you know jesus when
[35:45] he was here on earth he wasn't satisfied
[35:47] with just healings but he had to
[35:48] identify who he was
[35:50] and you know the pharisees everybody was
[35:52] fine with him healing everybody and
[35:54] and even even preaching a little bit
[35:55] when he began to say that he was the son
[35:57] of god that's when they begin to have
[35:58] problems amen
[36:00] and the devil's okay with you coming to
[36:01] church he's okay with you getting healed
[36:03] he's okay with you doing this and that
[36:05] but when you begin to identify yourself
[36:07] as a son and daughter of god that's when
[36:09] he has a problem amen
[36:10] amen do you love the lord this evening
[36:13] and brother braham says and i know
[36:14] my redeemer liveth he says no matter how
[36:17] little you are how big you are how
[36:18] important you are or how unimportant you
[36:20] are you are here to serve a purpose
[36:22] amen are you thankful for that even us
[36:25] unimportant people
[36:26] god has a purpose god has a plan for our
[36:28] life he says
[36:29] just as my finger is here to serve a
[36:31] purpose my nail on my finger serves a
[36:33] purpose he says
[36:34] my eye and every part of our body is to
[36:36] serve a purpose and it was not only put
[36:38] here to see what we would look like
[36:40] when we were put here but it was here to
[36:41] serve a purpose it was god's divine plan
[36:44] to do so
[36:45] he said nothing can harm us until that
[36:47] purpose that god has put us here for
[36:49] has been made manifest he said no matter
[36:52] how much trouble we have no matter how
[36:53] much heartaches or sorrow we go through
[36:56] all of these are reasons and there or he
[36:57] says all of these have a reason there's
[36:59] a reason for it so
[37:01] so whatever you're going through
[37:02] whatever you've been through god has a
[37:04] reason for it amen
[37:05] we can't see it right now we may look
[37:07] and it just may looks like a terrible
[37:08] outcome but god will see us through amen
[37:11] i believe if we depend on him he'll see
[37:13] us through amen
[37:14] now you know david could testify about
[37:17] the line and the bear but then then
[37:18] goliath showed up is that right
[37:20] so we see that when the enemy comes up
[37:21] we can look at our testimonies and i
[37:23] know the scripture says we overcome
[37:25] by the word of the lord of the blood of
[37:26] the lamb and the word of our testimony
[37:28] but when we come to our next battle we
[37:30] can't just say well he did this he did
[37:31] that we've got to face that battle amen
[37:33] we've got to fight that battle
[37:35] i believe his message people we can't
[37:37] get complacent we can't get satisfied
[37:39] with our current state
[37:40] we've got to press towards the mark of
[37:41] the high calling amen we've got to
[37:43] until we take a rapture we should be
[37:45] striving to get closer to him amen
[37:48] now matthew 7 20 i'll just throw this in
[37:50] there it says wherefore by their fruits
[37:52] you shall know them
[37:53] now the fruit is the manifestation of
[37:55] the seed is that right
[37:57] so what the seed is you don't know what
[37:59] a seed is if i laid a bunch of seeds out
[38:00] here you wouldn't know maybe perhaps
[38:02] what the seeds would be but if i laid
[38:04] the fruits out here you would know
[38:06] what those seeds had manifested is that
[38:08] right we don't you know we don't um we
[38:10] don't look at seeds and
[38:11] and say well this is going to be this or
[38:13] this is going to be that maybe
[38:14] somebody's
[38:15] very good and and can do that but i
[38:17] can't you know we've got to look at the
[38:18] fruit is that right
[38:19] and so we're not here to judge one
[38:21] another or look at this one or look at
[38:22] that one or
[38:23] or to say well well this is that or this
[38:25] is that because we don't know what the
[38:26] seed is on the inside is that right
[38:29] you know it doesn't always show what's
[38:30] on the inside you know brother braham
[38:32] says a harlot could walk across a
[38:33] platform and get healed a lot
[38:34] a lot quicker than a christian because
[38:36] of their faith and so what i want to say
[38:38] to that is that you know we can't look
[38:39] at one another and say well that's not
[38:41] what the christian person should look
[38:42] like because god
[38:44] may not be done in their life is that
[38:45] right it may not be their manifesting
[38:47] season amen
[38:49] so we see that you know that god didn't
[38:51] call us to be a squatter he caught us to
[38:53] to own our land and he he gave us the
[38:56] rights as christians and believers
[38:58] that when we stood upon the word of god
[38:59] whatever we would ask in his name he
[39:01] would give it to us is that right
[39:02] and so we can't let satan come in and
[39:05] and take control of that and
[39:06] and say well you know it was good for
[39:08] paul it was good for this one it was
[39:09] good for that one but it's not good for
[39:11] you
[39:12] and so we see that that when god when
[39:14] satan begins to do that we begin to
[39:15] become
[39:16] satisfied and say well where i'm at is
[39:18] okay
[39:19] and i don't think as christians we
[39:20] should ever do that you believe that
[39:22] this evening
[39:23] now we're called for a reason just as
[39:25] ruth was called to bow as the bride is
[39:27] being called
[39:28] to christ is that right we're on a
[39:29] journey to meet our bridegroom is that
[39:31] right
[39:32] now the call has been manifested through
[39:34] our lives and we see that
[39:36] it's not through religion it's not
[39:38] through this because churches will come
[39:40] people will come and churches will go
[39:41] and people will go but if you've got
[39:43] something on the inside you'll stay with
[39:45] the word of god is that right
[39:47] whenever you hear the word of god you'll
[39:48] dot it with an amen is that right
[39:50] whenever the word of god comes forth
[39:52] there's just something on the inside of
[39:53] you you can't help it even if you don't
[39:54] like the man or the ministry or anything
[39:56] like that you have to say amen to it is
[39:58] that right
[39:59] now brother brandon says there's one
[40:01] thing that won't go the holy spirit
[40:02] because it's his word
[40:04] he said a real predestinated believer
[40:06] will not go away because it's food to
[40:08] his soul amen
[40:09] so we see that when we hear that food
[40:11] when we hear that word it's food to our
[40:13] soul and we can't help but respond to it
[40:15] amen
[40:16] he said he loves it he said and nothing
[40:18] can keep him away from it he'll do
[40:19] anything just like jacob he wants that
[40:22] birthright
[40:23] and if i'm a christian and today in the
[40:24] seventh day i want to be like
[40:26] i want to have the the desire that jacob
[40:28] had to get my birthright amen
[40:30] i don't want to be just another person
[40:31] that just comes and participates in the
[40:33] service and does this and that
[40:34] but i want to excel in christ amen i
[40:37] want the devil
[40:38] to remember my name whenever he's being
[40:39] cast into the lake of fire is that right
[40:41] i want to know that i stood on the word
[40:43] of god and god used me to my full
[40:45] ability amen
[40:47] he said he loves it nothing can keep him
[40:48] away from it he says he wants that
[40:50] birthright he'll stand there i don't
[40:51] care if it costs
[40:52] every friend he's got if it costs his
[40:54] job as church membership if it costs
[40:56] everything he'll hold
[40:58] to it amen because he cannot help it and
[41:00] i believe that's been shown in this day
[41:01] and in this hour you know
[41:03] people will pass away people are leaving
[41:04] the message and doing this or that but i
[41:06] can't leave because it's just something
[41:08] on the inside
[41:09] is calling out to that amen and there's
[41:11] something that responds in his word and
[41:13] i just it just matches up that's what i
[41:15] love and desire amen
[41:16] he said there's something in him moving
[41:18] him the deep calling to the deep he says
[41:19] oh there you are something inside of him
[41:22] and i think that's where we get we get
[41:24] confused as much as people we look too
[41:25] much at the flesh we look too much at
[41:27] others we look at this one and that one
[41:29] but when we should be looking at christ
[41:30] because he's the one on the throne room
[41:32] he's the one
[41:33] in the control tower amen now we see
[41:36] that just like ruth and i'm just going
[41:37] to
[41:38] just to just pull a few people out here
[41:39] but ruth was determined she forsook her
[41:41] home her family
[41:42] everything she forsook it to go meet the
[41:45] to go meet boaz because
[41:47] naomi had told her of something that she
[41:50] had never seen
[41:51] she told her told her about her homeland
[41:53] told her about this and that and
[41:54] and there was something on the inside a
[41:56] route that she couldn't explain but she
[41:57] wanted to go there amen
[41:59] and how many of you you maybe grew up in
[42:01] a different church a nominal church you
[42:03] grew up in the world or you grew up in a
[42:04] message pew and
[42:05] and one day just something that the
[42:07] minister said struck you and it was just
[42:08] something you desired to be a part of
[42:10] amen
[42:12] so you know we look and we look at the
[42:14] manifestation of a seed and and when we
[42:16] look at the fruits and
[42:17] and you know god god calls people
[42:19] according to his calling not according
[42:21] to our agenda amen
[42:23] you know if we look if we look at the
[42:25] rich young ruler and he would have been
[42:27] probably the person that we'd wanted to
[42:28] preach the person we'd want in our
[42:30] church
[42:31] but if you look at the seed the prodigal
[42:33] and the pig pen was who god had chosen
[42:35] amen
[42:35] so you know we may have wanted the rich
[42:37] young ruler here we wanted him to be the
[42:39] one speaking but it was actually the one
[42:40] out in the pig pen that god had called
[42:42] and four ordained
[42:43] so it's not by what we can see but it's
[42:45] by what god can see amen
[42:47] that's why we ought not to judge other
[42:48] people because god could be
[42:50] could have that seed on the inside and
[42:53] we could be calling out against god's
[42:54] elect is that right
[42:57] now we see that um that that christians
[42:59] in this day
[43:00] you know it's the way the enemy looks is
[43:03] everything that is now
[43:04] that everything that was called evil is
[43:05] now called good in today's in today's
[43:07] standards
[43:08] and that's just the way the world is but
[43:10] as message believers as
[43:12] christians we cannot allow that to creep
[43:13] into our own ranks because
[43:15] even if you look years ago i know you
[43:17] know when i was growing up in
[43:18] in the message and you know music that
[43:20] we listen to today that's that's more
[43:22] uh contemporary i guess what you call it
[43:24] there's no way we could have listened to
[43:26] that back in the day and
[43:27] and that's just the way it was and you
[43:29] know we couldn't have done
[43:30] some of the things we do today that we
[43:31] could have done back then you know
[43:32] what's changed
[43:33] you know it wasn't god right it's the
[43:35] people that's changed amen
[43:37] now i'm not saying anything that thing
[43:38] is wrong you know obviously i play the
[43:40] drums i don't believe any of that's
[43:41] wrong if we played in the right spirit i
[43:43] believe i could come up here and play in
[43:44] the wrong spirit
[43:45] and it would be wrong i could just like
[43:47] i could come and preach in the wrong
[43:48] spirit and it'd be wrong
[43:49] and some of you can come to church in
[43:51] the wrong spirit and it'd be wrong
[43:52] so we have to all prepare ourselves we
[43:54] all have a part to play from the
[43:56] musicians to the to the lay members
[43:58] sitting on the pew if you want something
[43:59] from god don't expect the pastor just to
[44:01] be the one in the right mind
[44:02] we've got to get in the right mind amen
[44:04] so we've got to come to church expecting
[44:07] good results if you come to church
[44:08] expecting problems you'll get problems
[44:10] if you come expecting healing you're
[44:12] going to get healing amen
[44:13] so it's what we put into it is what
[44:15] we're going to get out of it amen
[44:17] we can't depend on the preacher the
[44:18] minister the evangelist this one or that
[44:20] one to come and just
[44:21] preach us happy or preach us this or
[44:23] that if the word is being come forth we
[44:25] ought to be happy amen
[44:27] amen do you love the lord this evening i
[44:30] love how brother branham he said this
[44:31] and i don't know where it is but he said
[44:33] the sin that
[44:33] once ruled you you now rule it amen what
[44:36] used to have jurisdiction over you you
[44:38] now have jurisdiction over it
[44:40] you no longer yield yourself to that
[44:42] thing because you have realized you have
[44:44] the power
[44:45] you have the ability and the authority
[44:46] in jesus christ to call out against that
[44:49] thing
[44:49] and be an overcomer amen now brother
[44:52] abraham says here he says it says with
[44:53] moses so will i be with thee he says oh
[44:55] how can you try to make all the lutheran
[44:57] see at the baptist seat and the
[44:58] presbyterians and nazarenes and
[45:00] pilgrim holy she says don't condemn them
[45:01] that's all they know
[45:03] that's all that's in them but you who do
[45:05] believe he says oh god to you who know
[45:07] to you that's got something in you
[45:08] that's calling to the deep he says if
[45:10] all you've got
[45:11] has been satisfied he said then stay
[45:13] where you are he says but for us for me
[45:15] in my house there's something more than
[45:17] what i can see
[45:18] amen i don't know about you but i i love
[45:20] the ministry i love brother ben but
[45:22] there's something more until i take a
[45:23] rapture i want to keep striving amen
[45:26] he said i know there's a land beyond the
[45:27] river somewhere he says there's a deep
[45:29] calling to the deep and i cannot be
[45:31] satisfied
[45:32] with just theology amen you shouldn't
[45:34] come to church and just be satisfied
[45:36] with the minister getting up and
[45:37] preaching
[45:38] and the songs coming forth he said i
[45:39] cannot be satisfied with just a little
[45:41] healing service
[45:42] there's something beyond that that's
[45:44] calling amen so until we actually get
[45:46] the fullness of christ that's when we
[45:48] can be
[45:49] fully satisfied amen but until we get to
[45:52] that point it's not that we can't enjoy
[45:53] and be happy and
[45:54] and experience the the presence of the
[45:57] lord but but don't stop there
[45:58] continue on in christ amen
[46:02] don't stop trying to grow it's harvest
[46:04] time i think that's one of the saddest
[46:05] things
[46:06] you see it a lot in business you see it
[46:07] a lot in churches people will get
[46:09] people will get to a certain state and
[46:10] then they just stop they have so much
[46:12] more potential they could go so much
[46:14] further they could go so much further
[46:15] than where they're currently at
[46:17] but they got satisfied in that state and
[46:20] as a christian i never want to get
[46:21] satisfied i know brother branham says
[46:23] you know i could go out and and live out
[46:24] in the wilderness and
[46:25] never come to church again never do this
[46:27] and he would still go to heaven is that
[46:29] right
[46:29] but in his heart he didn't want to do
[46:31] that why because he wanted that he still
[46:33] had a deep calling on the inside
[46:36] amen just like caleb he wasn't satisfied
[46:38] with just crossing jordan he wanted his
[46:40] mountain amen
[46:42] amen satan likes satisfied people he
[46:45] keeps them in more of a stagnant state
[46:47] he
[46:47] he enjoys satisfied people
[46:51] amen do you love the lord
[46:55] i'm not going to be very long tonight so
[46:57] don't worry
[46:58] get in and pull and when i come in the
[47:00] back i had two computers and a printer
[47:02] and
[47:03] but nothing was working so my brother
[47:05] ben helped me we finally got it all
[47:08] all laid out and you know i'll skip over
[47:10] half of it but
[47:11] where the lord leads that's where we
[47:12] want to go amen
[47:14] you know i'm a big believer you know
[47:15] when i was when i wasn't living right
[47:18] and i was i was coming back to the lord
[47:19] and and you know i'd ask god to speak to
[47:21] me and then he would and i'd be like
[47:22] okay that's
[47:24] that's enough you know i'd come to
[47:25] church and i'd ask him to speak to him
[47:27] and the minister would get up and start
[47:28] calling everything out calling
[47:29] everything out and
[47:30] and so if you come tonight you know and
[47:32] you didn't ask god to speak to you then
[47:33] what are you doing here
[47:34] right did you actually ask god speak to
[47:36] me tonight
[47:38] you know what are you doing here you're
[47:39] just coming to be satisfied to fulfill
[47:41] a position that is mandated because
[47:43] that's what we're supposed to do or did
[47:45] you come here because you had a desire
[47:47] in your heart
[47:47] to find christ and you know as
[47:50] christians you can blame it on the
[47:51] minister say well alan you're just not
[47:52] that good of a minister but i guarantee
[47:53] if you ask god to speak to you he'll
[47:55] somehow
[47:56] take this horrible vessel and speak to
[47:58] you through it amen
[47:59] that's the way god works i believe
[48:00] brother abraham said it's the hardest
[48:02] thing for one individual one mortal to
[48:03] believe another mortal
[48:04] but that's the way god works he didn't
[48:06] call the trees to preach he didn't call
[48:07] the waters to preach
[48:08] he called man to preach amen and that's
[48:11] what is that if that's our calling
[48:13] that's what we've got to do
[48:14] but as christians as believers if you
[48:16] come to church and you have no desire
[48:18] you have
[48:18] you have no ambition let me put it that
[48:20] way you have no ambition to actually get
[48:22] more of god why do you think you would
[48:23] actually get more of god
[48:25] right if i go to a restaurant and i
[48:27] don't put in my order i'm not going to
[48:28] get fed amen
[48:29] if you come to church and you don't put
[48:31] in your order you're not going to get
[48:32] fed amen
[48:33] it's not the minister's fault if you
[48:35] leave here tonight and you're not healed
[48:36] it's not our fault it's not god's fault
[48:38] it's your fault amen
[48:39] if you leave here tonight unsatisfied
[48:41] it's not god's fault it's not my fault
[48:43] it's your fault tonight amen just
[48:45] reading the scripture you ought to be
[48:47] able to take something from that if
[48:48] you're pulling on the word of god god
[48:49] will speak to you through that amen
[48:51] you may have had a tough day at work you
[48:53] may have battles in the family but god
[48:55] is here to let you know it's going to be
[48:57] okay
[48:58] amen first john 3 1 he says behold what
[49:00] manner of love the father hath bestowed
[49:02] on us
[49:03] that we should be called the sons of god
[49:05] amen i tell you i don't know about you
[49:07] but that makes my heart warm that i be
[49:08] called a son of god amen
[49:10] not that i'm called a message believer
[49:12] not that i'm called i go to this church
[49:13] or that church but
[49:14] i'm called a son of god amen amen
[49:17] therefore the world knoweth us not
[49:19] because it knew him not beloved
[49:22] now are we the sons of god not we're
[49:23] going to be not not maybe we will be but
[49:25] we are
[49:26] right now in present time and it doth
[49:28] not appear what we shall
[49:30] be but we know that when he shall appear
[49:32] we shall be like him for we shall see
[49:34] him
[49:35] as he is i don't about you but i'm ready
[49:36] for that change amen
[49:38] he said every man had that hath hope in
[49:41] him purify
[49:42] himself even as he is pure whosoever
[49:44] committed sin transgresseth
[49:46] also the law for sin is the
[49:48] transgression of the law
[49:49] and you know that he was manifested to
[49:52] take away our sins and
[49:53] in him is no sin so we see that jesus
[49:57] christ was
[49:57] manifested his purpose was to come and
[50:00] save the world
[50:01] is that right for god so loved the world
[50:03] he sent his only begotten son
[50:04] so we see that christ was manifested to
[50:07] take away our sins and
[50:08] and then in him was no sin and i want to
[50:11] skip on down to verse
[50:12] 8 and it says he that committeth sin is
[50:14] of the devil for the devil sinneth from
[50:15] the beginning
[50:16] for this purpose the son of god was
[50:19] manifested that he might destroy
[50:21] the works of the devil amen i'm so glad
[50:24] that he's going to do away everything
[50:25] that satan put against you everything
[50:27] that satan calls you to do
[50:29] he's going to destroy that so in the in
[50:31] the end is that right
[50:33] amen do you love do you love the lord
[50:34] this evening i read a quote i don't
[50:36] remember who it was by but it was some
[50:38] gentleman said you know god has already
[50:40] got god has already factored in your
[50:42] faults and your failures
[50:43] quit worrying about it and move on in
[50:45] christ amen
[50:47] amen do you love the lord this evening
[50:50] amen i believe many times we get too
[50:51] focused in on the little things that we
[50:53] get too focusing on what this one's
[50:54] doing what that one's doing and
[50:55] i believe as winston churchill has said
[50:57] you'll never get where you're going if
[50:58] you stop and throw a rock at every dog
[51:00] that barks amen
[51:02] amen i believe we ought to come to
[51:03] christ we ought to focus in on him i
[51:05] don't need to worry about what's going
[51:06] on with this family that family
[51:07] and and try to get involved in this try
[51:09] to get involved in that just let me come
[51:11] and let me serve the lord amen
[51:12] amen you don't need to be going to the
[51:14] pastor all the time and i don't know if
[51:15] anybody's doing this but
[51:16] go ahead well i know about this i know
[51:17] about this i know about this let god
[51:19] deal with it amen how about you do that
[51:20] one time begin to pray get on your knees
[51:22] amen
[51:23] begin to call upon the name of the lord
[51:24] and let him handle the situation amen
[51:27] and brother ben hasn't told me anything
[51:28] if anybody's been telling him anything
[51:30] he hadn't told me but
[51:31] but that's just that's just the spirit
[51:32] of the lord amen
[51:34] amen if you if you stop and throw a rock
[51:36] at every dog that will bought the
[51:38] barks you'll never get to where you need
[51:39] to go now nothing that you try to do
[51:42] nothing you manufacture you can't
[51:43] manufacture salvation
[51:45] you can't manufacture the gifts you've
[51:47] got to bear the gifts
[51:49] it's something on the inside that just
[51:50] expresses itself and you can't help but
[51:52] show it amen
[51:54] the the he says the sheep doesn't
[51:56] manufacture the wool he has wool because
[51:58] he's a sheep he just
[51:59] bares the wool just as a cherry tree it
[52:02] doesn't manufacture cherry it
[52:04] just bears cherries because that's the
[52:05] life and the way
[52:07] now i could go out and say i'm an nba
[52:09] pro all-star all i want to do but
[52:11] there's no manifestation of that
[52:13] right i couldn't play college boy i
[52:15] could barely play high school there's no
[52:16] manifestation of that
[52:18] is that right but if there's something
[52:20] on the inside as brother burnham says
[52:21] you've got the spirit of i believe it's
[52:22] john dillinger you'd carry pistols on
[52:24] your side is that right
[52:25] if you had the spirit of michael jordan
[52:26] you'd be a you'd be an athlete you'd be
[52:28] a player but if we have the spirit of
[52:29] christ it should reflect
[52:31] christ on the outside amen he said the
[52:34] church of the living god doesn't inject
[52:35] this or try to make themselves look like
[52:37] something
[52:38] they're already what they are by the
[52:40] grace of god and i i just love that so
[52:42] much right there i don't have to
[52:44] you know i don't have to look like this
[52:45] church and i'm to look like this family
[52:46] i want to look like this one
[52:48] i am what i am by the grace of god is
[52:50] that right now
[52:51] that doesn't mean i can continue on in
[52:53] sin that doesn't mean i can continue to
[52:55] do whatever i want to do but once your
[52:57] your soul has been filled with the holy
[52:58] ghost god doesn't begin to change
[53:00] everything about you yes he changes
[53:02] certain aspects but we don't have to
[53:04] live like this one or live like that
[53:05] when
[53:05] god called us to be who we are amen you
[53:08] know i love it you know i was talking to
[53:10] somebody the other day and you know
[53:12] people like to pick people and and if
[53:13] they do it it's okay and they set that
[53:15] as their standard right
[53:16] you know well if i looked at it and said
[53:18] well brother ben lets his kids do that
[53:20] so
[53:21] that's becomes my standard for me
[53:22] letting my kids do that
[53:24] now there's nothing wrong with you know
[53:26] with going you know with obviously
[53:28] going to your pastor and asking if this
[53:29] is okay or that's okay or or looking at
[53:31] what the prophet did and do it and doing
[53:32] the similar things but we can't set
[53:34] those people as our standard
[53:35] we can't set those people and say well
[53:37] this is my standard for how i'm going to
[53:39] raise my kids raise my family or serve
[53:41] the lord
[53:42] we can't do that what's on the inside
[53:44] god it's got to be the standard has to
[53:46] be the word we've got to go back to the
[53:48] word the spirit of god has got to lead
[53:50] each and every individual is that right
[53:53] amen do you love the lord
[53:54] so if christ is on the inside it has to
[53:57] manifest on the outside
[53:58] that's the thing you know you may be
[53:59] able to hide sin you may be able to hide
[54:01] this or that for a certain
[54:02] season it will eventually come out but
[54:04] you can't hide christ
[54:06] amen there's just something about him
[54:07] once he gets on the inside he's going to
[54:09] come
[54:10] out eventually he's going to show on the
[54:11] outside because he's declaring in this
[54:14] day that we're not like the first eve is
[54:15] that right
[54:16] that we there we're going to be a
[54:17] different bride we're not going to fall
[54:19] like the first one but we're going to
[54:20] make it all the way to the end
[54:23] now you know if you ask joshua why i was
[54:24] marching around jericho on the first day
[54:26] he maybe would not have known
[54:28] the second day the third day the fourth
[54:29] day the fifth day the sixth day but on
[54:31] the seventh day until those walls come
[54:32] crashing down
[54:33] until the battle was over he still
[54:35] didn't know why he was marching but the
[54:36] lord said to do it amen
[54:38] and if god says something in his word he
[54:40] says to do it we ought to follow through
[54:42] to the very end is that right
[54:44] now second timothy chapter one and seven
[54:46] uh
[54:47] chapter one and verse seven i told
[54:48] brother ben i was gonna try to slow down
[54:50] i just cannot do it
[54:56] amen see where was it
[55:00] i am what i am by the grace of god so
[55:01] you're going to deal with it so
[55:04] now that doesn't mean you know when i
[55:06] say that you know it's bad as a minister
[55:09] every time you say something you almost
[55:10] have to combat combat seven different
[55:12] thought processes with
[55:14] it you know if i say god has changed you
[55:16] he's called you his grace is sufficient
[55:17] well then you have to go back and talk
[55:19] to the to the
[55:20] make believer and say well you can't
[55:21] just do anything you have to talk to the
[55:23] unbeliever and say you know
[55:24] you know you can't just continue on in
[55:26] sin and then you've got to talk to the
[55:27] believer and say hey you've got to let
[55:28] this go
[55:29] god has covered it you know and that's
[55:30] the way it is you know you can say well
[55:31] i am what i am
[55:33] and that doesn't mean you can still be
[55:34] mean to other people you know if you
[55:35] were mean god's going to take that hell
[55:36] that's not the spirit of god to be mean
[55:38] so
[55:38] so if you're mean and cranky and
[55:40] cantankerous that's not the spirit of
[55:41] god i'm sorry you can't just say well i
[55:43] am the way that i
[55:44] am and you're not going to change it
[55:46] right you know i could say that to my
[55:47] wife
[55:48] she's eventually gonna get tired of it
[55:49] you know well hey
[55:51] you're not gonna change it i'm beginning
[55:52] to realize that maybe we need to change
[55:53] something else is that right
[55:55] so we can't just say i am the way that i
[55:57] am and i'm not gonna change
[55:59] right you're stagnant if you're doing
[56:01] that amen
[56:03] whoever that was for we got to have
[56:06] personal growth occasionally amen
[56:10] i don't remember where i was for god
[56:12] hath not given us the spirit of fear but
[56:14] of power and of love and of a sound
[56:16] mind be not thou therefore ashamed of
[56:19] the testimony of our lord nor of me as
[56:21] prisoner but
[56:21] be thou a partaker of the afflictions of
[56:24] the gospel according
[56:25] to the power of god who hath saved us
[56:28] and called us with a holy calling
[56:30] not according to our works thank the
[56:32] lord he didn't call us according to our
[56:34] works amen
[56:35] because i would have not have been good
[56:36] enough but he caught us according to his
[56:38] own purpose and grace which was given us
[56:41] in christ jesus before the world began
[56:45] he says but is now made manifest
[56:47] by the appearing of our savior jesus
[56:49] christ who with abolished death
[56:51] and hath brought life and immortality to
[56:53] light
[56:54] through the gospel so we see that we
[56:56] were called in christ jesus
[56:58] before the world began but is now made
[57:00] manifest
[57:01] by the appearing of the savior our jesus
[57:03] christ our savior jesus christ
[57:05] so we see that the the seed was planted
[57:07] before the foundation of the world our
[57:09] names were called before the foundation
[57:10] of the world our names were on the land
[57:11] book of life
[57:12] before the foundational world but now is
[57:14] the manifestation of that
[57:17] now you can look at that and say well
[57:18] i'm not manifesting what i want to what
[57:20] i want to be what i feel like christ is
[57:21] going to be then you need to get to the
[57:22] altery man you need to get into the word
[57:24] and find
[57:25] where you messed up or where you went
[57:26] wrong because god will have an elect
[57:28] bride that will stand in this day that
[57:30] will live a life
[57:32] like no other is that right now we've
[57:34] been called by a
[57:36] holy calling something that we can't
[57:37] explain this isn't a this isn't a
[57:39] worldly
[57:40] calling to where where maybe i would
[57:41] call you and maybe for a job or
[57:43] something and say well this is your
[57:44] specific job but this is a holy calling
[57:47] this is different than if a boss tells
[57:48] you this is your job these are your job
[57:50] duties if you have any questions go to
[57:52] hr but this is a holy calling
[57:54] that christ has caught us and he doesn't
[57:55] say well this is everything you've got
[57:56] to do
[57:57] right he doesn't say this is what you've
[57:59] got to do start to finish this is your
[58:01] purpose in life
[58:02] we've got to find that along the way and
[58:05] you know maybe
[58:06] you're struggling i don't know what my
[58:07] purpose is i don't know what purpose is
[58:08] well i can tell you first right off the
[58:10] bat your first purpose is to serve the
[58:11] lord amen
[58:14] now brother brahma says in influences he
[58:15] says he says it'll put you into action
[58:18] if you haven't got it he says it'll put
[58:20] you into action when you see the word of
[58:22] god fulfilled
[58:23] he said what we've seen in the last days
[58:25] ought to put us in action it should do
[58:27] it
[58:27] if we just do it with reverence and
[58:29] humility the
[58:30] pillar of fire before paul put him into
[58:32] action and today when we see the same
[58:35] pillar of fire by science by its results
[58:37] by what it's promised making the word in
[58:39] these last days come
[58:41] before he says come to pass exactly he
[58:43] said it should put us
[58:45] into action he said that's the sign has
[58:47] been given as it was in the days of
[58:48] sodom he said just before
[58:50] sodom burns so shall be the coming of
[58:52] the son of man
[58:53] he'll be manifested again and i ask you
[58:55] how is he going to be manifested other
[58:57] than you and i
[58:58] is that right he said by the same he
[59:00] said he's the same yesterday today and
[59:02] forever it ought to put every member of
[59:03] the body of christ
[59:04] into action and i ask you tonight where
[59:06] to left tabernacle are you put into
[59:08] action
[59:08] are you are you in action mode are you
[59:11] just satisfied with where you're
[59:12] currently at he says
[59:13] getting everything in you can because
[59:15] it's the last hour it's the last call
[59:17] word by word it's been fulfilled
[59:19] this should certainly put us into action
[59:22] and as sons and daughters of god we
[59:24] ought to be called to action we ought to
[59:25] be ready to fight when god needs us
[59:27] we want to be ready is that right i love
[59:30] this i just threw this in here brother
[59:31] branham says you can scream and yell all
[59:33] you want he says the devil isn't heart
[59:35] of healing
[59:36] but he knows where the faith is that
[59:38] right you can come up here you can
[59:40] scream you can shout you can do
[59:41] everything you want
[59:42] satan doesn't care about any of that he
[59:44] knows where the faith is
[59:46] and i want you to know tonight you don't
[59:47] you don't have to be a good speaker you
[59:49] don't have to be a good singer you don't
[59:50] have to be this or that
[59:51] if you've got faith in the word of god
[59:54] he'll stand on that is that right
[59:56] amen i also love this faith is not an
[59:58] emotion it's a decision
[1:00:00] it's a decision to stand on god's word
[1:00:03] faith isn't something that you just
[1:00:04] manufacture this or that you know jesus
[1:00:06] when he says he's coming back he didn't
[1:00:08] ask if he's going to find good churches
[1:00:09] long-haired women well-dressed women
[1:00:11] well-dressed men well-behaved men
[1:00:13] he said will i find faith that's what he
[1:00:15] wants is faith in the word of god amen
[1:00:18] amen i'll be bringing to close just in a
[1:00:20] few minutes just hanging with me just
[1:00:21] for another second
[1:00:23] john 14 and 16 he says and i will pray
[1:00:26] the father and he shall give you another
[1:00:27] comforter that he may abide with you
[1:00:29] forever you thankful for that
[1:00:31] amen that we're sealed unto the day of
[1:00:32] our redemption that when he left he
[1:00:33] didn't leave us comfortless but he sent
[1:00:35] us a comforter
[1:00:37] even the spirit of truth whom the world
[1:00:39] cannot receive because it seeth him not
[1:00:42] neither knoweth him but ye know him for
[1:00:44] he dwelleth with you and shall be in you
[1:00:46] and we see the spirit of truth that he
[1:00:49] sends to us
[1:00:49] the world cannot receive and if there's
[1:00:51] ever a time that we see in this day
[1:00:53] that the world rejects truth and calls
[1:00:55] it a lie and then accepts lies
[1:00:57] and calls it the truth it's this day is
[1:00:59] that right the
[1:01:00] the mental capacity the mental state of
[1:01:02] people is just
[1:01:03] insane it just to to you and i we just
[1:01:06] look at it we say that's the craziest
[1:01:07] thing i've ever heard and i've ever seen
[1:01:09] but it's the way the world is working is
[1:01:11] that right and it should show us what
[1:01:13] hour we're living in
[1:01:14] verse 18 i will not leave you
[1:01:16] comfortless i will come to you yet a
[1:01:17] little while in the world seeth me no
[1:01:19] more but ye
[1:01:20] see me because i live you shall live
[1:01:22] also and i love that portion of
[1:01:23] scripture there
[1:01:24] you know when christ went away he says
[1:01:26] you you shall see me
[1:01:28] and i believe that's the revelation
[1:01:29] through the word we see christ when when
[1:01:31] the word is coming forth we can see
[1:01:32] christ in his word is that right
[1:01:34] we can see christ in the life of other
[1:01:36] believers we can see christ
[1:01:38] when the word comes forth and it speaks
[1:01:39] to our hearts we know that's christ
[1:01:40] speaking to you and i
[1:01:43] he says but the world he said but you
[1:01:44] see me because i live you shall live
[1:01:46] also
[1:01:47] at the day you shall know that i am in
[1:01:49] my father and you and me and i in you
[1:01:51] he that hath my commandments and keepeth
[1:01:53] them he it is that loveth me and he that
[1:01:55] loveth me shall be loved of my father
[1:01:57] and i will love him
[1:01:59] and will manifest myself to him now
[1:02:02] brother branham he goes into the
[1:02:03] scripture he says man shall not live by
[1:02:04] bread alone but by every word that
[1:02:06] proceedeth out of the mouth of god he
[1:02:07] says hallelujah he says
[1:02:08] he says you say i'm excited but no i'm
[1:02:10] not he says he said brother if i'm
[1:02:12] excited let me say this way he says well
[1:02:13] why he says god is
[1:02:14] in his people manifesting himself in the
[1:02:17] flesh of mortal beings who's been
[1:02:19] born again he says do you believe that
[1:02:21] so i want to read that again
[1:02:22] god is in his people manifested himself
[1:02:25] in the flesh
[1:02:26] of mortal beings who's born again do you
[1:02:29] believe that
[1:02:30] so we see that in this day you know you
[1:02:31] look at you look at who is god's hands
[1:02:34] we are
[1:02:34] who's god's feet we are who's god's eyes
[1:02:36] his his mouth we are we're
[1:02:38] god is being manifested in our lives in
[1:02:41] this day he says you believe god is in
[1:02:42] his universe
[1:02:43] you see him in the sunlight you see him
[1:02:45] in a tree and a flower in his word and
[1:02:47] his son
[1:02:47] and in his people he said
[1:02:50] then here's god right here he says amen
[1:02:52] knowing the thoughts of men and
[1:02:54] discerning the thoughts and
[1:02:55] healing the sick and making the blind to
[1:02:56] see and the death to hear the lame to
[1:02:58] walk
[1:02:58] the only thing that's limiting god is
[1:03:00] our faith he says hallelujah oh my
[1:03:03] so the only thing that limits god is our
[1:03:05] faith how high
[1:03:06] can we climb how high can our faith go
[1:03:09] amen
[1:03:09] he said the life of god must be made
[1:03:12] manifest
[1:03:12] in our lives and when it is nothing can
[1:03:14] overcome us because christ cannot be
[1:03:16] defeated you believe that
[1:03:18] now as christians we begin to look at
[1:03:20] the outside too much we begin to look at
[1:03:21] the things we've done in the past the
[1:03:23] things that we're
[1:03:24] you know thinking about you know the
[1:03:25] things we struggle with and
[1:03:27] and god doesn't want us to look at that
[1:03:28] he wants us to look at him is that right
[1:03:33] amen do you love the lord this evening
[1:03:35] well we literally become the living word
[1:03:37] for this hour the word of god can defeat
[1:03:39] satan at any time
[1:03:41] in any place under any circumstance and
[1:03:43] you of i have been called to be that
[1:03:45] word for this day do you believe that
[1:03:48] now we ought to as christians you know
[1:03:50] many times you know you see me come to
[1:03:52] church and as a minister it's kind of
[1:03:53] hard to preach these things that we
[1:03:54] ought to praise more we ought to worship
[1:03:56] god more
[1:03:57] because you see me and i know dealing
[1:03:58] with kids and and just dealing with
[1:04:00] thoughts and different things it's very
[1:04:02] hard to do that in this day
[1:04:03] the devil wants us to be distracted he
[1:04:05] wants us to our minds to be here
[1:04:07] our minds to be there our minds to be
[1:04:09] doing this but we ought to come to the
[1:04:11] house of god
[1:04:12] in one accord in one mind to see christ
[1:04:14] is that right and i believe if we could
[1:04:15] ever get there you know if you want
[1:04:17] revival to come focus on christ
[1:04:18] amen if you when they wanted jesus to
[1:04:21] come on the scene they begin calling
[1:04:23] jesus on the scene so if you want jesus
[1:04:25] in your life begin to praise him begin
[1:04:27] to worship and begin to call him on the
[1:04:28] scene
[1:04:29] and watch him show up when you're in the
[1:04:30] time of need amen
[1:04:32] now in the beginning the first book of
[1:04:35] the bible god told us not to break one
[1:04:36] word of that every word must be kept
[1:04:39] they must live by the word jesus said in
[1:04:41] the middle of the book come along and
[1:04:42] said that in this age he said man shall
[1:04:44] not live by bread alone but by every
[1:04:45] word that comes out of the mouth of god
[1:04:48] and then closing age of revelation e4
[1:04:50] told us that whosoever shall take one
[1:04:51] word another book or add one word to it
[1:04:53] his part
[1:04:54] shall be taken from the book of life
[1:04:56] therefore there can be
[1:04:57] nothing shadowy just genuine
[1:04:59] unadulterated word of god that's the
[1:05:01] sons and daughters of god
[1:05:03] who's not born by the will of man or by
[1:05:04] the shaking of hand or by some bad form
[1:05:06] of baptism but born in the spirit of god
[1:05:08] by the holy ghost
[1:05:10] and the word manifesting itself through
[1:05:12] them that's the genuine
[1:05:14] seed of god amen so i tell you again if
[1:05:16] jesus is on the inside he'll manifest on
[1:05:18] the outside you can't keep him bottled
[1:05:20] up
[1:05:21] you can't keep him sealed up if
[1:05:22] something happens if the word comes
[1:05:24] forth you've got to respond to it
[1:05:26] with an amen amen is that right so we
[1:05:28] see that when god has called us not only
[1:05:30] did he call us but he
[1:05:31] when he when his when a spirit took over
[1:05:32] our body it was something that
[1:05:34] that was just just so um so crazy to the
[1:05:37] human mind that we could actually yield
[1:05:39] ourselves to our father is that right
[1:05:41] and that we could yield ourselves in
[1:05:43] such a way that god could come and speak
[1:05:45] through our lives to other believers
[1:05:47] amen
[1:05:48] that we would be a witness in this day
[1:05:50] to the world and be a witness to other
[1:05:51] believers and
[1:05:52] and the nominal christians that god
[1:05:54] would choose us to do that amen
[1:05:56] it to me it's just amazing that god
[1:05:58] would go god would allow us to do that
[1:06:00] amen
[1:06:01] now as as we look back this is our time
[1:06:04] this is our day
[1:06:06] and i'm going to be bringing it down to
[1:06:07] a close just in a few minutes and and we
[1:06:09] see that when god has called us for this
[1:06:11] day for this hour
[1:06:12] he didn't equip us for the ephesian age
[1:06:14] or the pergamus or thy tire he equipped
[1:06:16] us for laodicea is that right
[1:06:18] so you can't sit back and say well well
[1:06:20] i don't have everything i need god's
[1:06:22] done this and god's done that or the
[1:06:23] world's done this or the world's done
[1:06:24] that god has equipped you to overcome
[1:06:27] everything that the enemy could throw at
[1:06:29] you in laodicea
[1:06:30] so we see that in this day there's no
[1:06:32] excuse for us to sit back and say well
[1:06:34] well i can do this or i can do that or i
[1:06:36] i'm not going to believe this or i'm not
[1:06:38] going to believe that there's no excuse
[1:06:40] amen because god has come in this day
[1:06:42] with the prophet messenger and revealed
[1:06:44] the message of the hour
[1:06:45] to you and i as believers is that right
[1:06:47] he's revealed the message the hour so we
[1:06:49] have
[1:06:50] everything we need to make a rapture and
[1:06:52] so it's not going to be god's fault it's
[1:06:54] not going to be the prophet's fault it's
[1:06:55] not going to be the ministry's fault
[1:06:56] if you missed it it's going to be your
[1:06:58] fault is that right but i'm so glad that
[1:07:00] as a son and daughter of god we can't
[1:07:02] miss it amen
[1:07:03] if that seed gene is on the inside god
[1:07:05] will call it when that when it's harvest
[1:07:07] time when it's raptured time that seed
[1:07:09] will have to go back
[1:07:11] to where it came from amen that's why
[1:07:13] that's why everything else will be cast
[1:07:15] in the lake of fire because it didn't
[1:07:16] come from god but if you come from god
[1:07:18] you will go back to god is that right
[1:07:21] amen for as many as are led by the
[1:07:22] spirit of god they are the sons of god
[1:07:24] is that right and i don't want the devil
[1:07:26] to come up to me and tell me what
[1:07:28] i am or what i ain't god told me what i
[1:07:30] was and by grace i was made that way and
[1:07:32] now i'm going to overcome by the grace
[1:07:34] of god because that's who he made me to
[1:07:36] be amen
[1:07:37] amen the only thing that is limiting god
[1:07:39] is our faith if you want to see greater
[1:07:41] things then raise your faith up to the
[1:07:43] next level
[1:07:44] amen you can't come in here with a 1960
[1:07:46] mentality and expect god to reveal you
[1:07:48] in a 2020 mentality amen
[1:07:50] and what i mean by that is not saying
[1:07:52] the word has lost its effect
[1:07:54] but the things that they battled in 1960
[1:07:56] is not the things we battle in 2020 but
[1:07:58] the same god that
[1:07:59] overcome in the 60s the 50s the 70s will
[1:08:02] overcome
[1:08:03] in 2020 is that right it doesn't matter
[1:08:06] that the enemies come out with new
[1:08:08] things there's new
[1:08:08] there's new sin there's the world has
[1:08:11] gone even further into insanity the same
[1:08:13] god
[1:08:14] will still allow you to be overcomers in
[1:08:16] this day do you believe that
[1:08:18] amen if romans 8 and 15 for ye have not
[1:08:20] received the spirit of bondage again to
[1:08:22] fear we're not supposed to be fearful
[1:08:24] we're supposed to be of a spirit of a
[1:08:25] sound mind as that ride of love
[1:08:27] but you have received the spirit of
[1:08:29] adoption whereby we cry abba father the
[1:08:31] spirit
[1:08:32] beareth itself beareth witness with our
[1:08:34] spirit that we
[1:08:35] are the children of god amen back to
[1:08:38] everybody we'll be happy over there
[1:08:40] you know the reason you it's terrible
[1:08:42] you know the reason there's no gospels
[1:08:44] over there there's no
[1:08:45] there's no people that cause trouble
[1:08:46] over there because they weren't there in
[1:08:48] the beginning
[1:08:49] is that right if you're causing trouble
[1:08:50] if you're if you're gossiping if your
[1:08:52] purpose
[1:08:53] in life is to cause trouble or see
[1:08:54] somebody else hurt you need to get saved
[1:08:57] amen
[1:08:57] you ain't got the spirit of god if you
[1:08:59] say you hate your brother and say you
[1:09:01] love god the scripture says you are a
[1:09:02] liar is that right
[1:09:04] we're not even to hate the denominations
[1:09:06] we're not even to hate the world we hate
[1:09:08] sin is that right but we've got to love
[1:09:10] one another do you believe that
[1:09:12] i believe that's where the world has
[1:09:13] perverted everything you can't cry out
[1:09:15] against the sin because they attach the
[1:09:16] sin to the person
[1:09:18] is that right but we as christians we as
[1:09:20] believers know that that's satan working
[1:09:22] in
[1:09:22] in a spiritual realm now the spirit
[1:09:25] itself
[1:09:26] beareth witness with our spirit so what
[1:09:28] that means is
[1:09:29] god's spirit and our spirit are doing
[1:09:30] the same thing
[1:09:32] so if you look in the bible and you're
[1:09:33] not doing the same thing you're not of
[1:09:35] that spirit
[1:09:37] not a lot of amen's there but it's the
[1:09:38] truth we are the children of god and if
[1:09:42] children then heirs heirs of god and
[1:09:44] joint heirs with christ if so be
[1:09:46] that we suffer with him that we may be
[1:09:49] also glorified together and this really
[1:09:51] the scripture here about adoption i've
[1:09:52] studied it quite a bit you know we
[1:09:54] with matthew we adopted him and you know
[1:09:56] whenever we adopted him
[1:09:57] his name was changed amen he become one
[1:10:00] of ours he was put onto our life
[1:10:01] insurance
[1:10:02] policies anything that was a beneficiary
[1:10:03] he was added to it we weren't going to
[1:10:05] treat him like he wasn't a son
[1:10:06] or he was a stepchild or this or that
[1:10:08] and that's the way god does when he
[1:10:09] brings you in you are just like christ
[1:10:11] to him amen
[1:10:12] join heirs with christ we are sons and
[1:10:15] daughters of god and everything that
[1:10:16] christ
[1:10:17] is entitled to you and i are entitled to
[1:10:19] amen
[1:10:20] amen he says in children and heirs of
[1:10:22] god he says join us with christ if so be
[1:10:24] that we suffer with him
[1:10:25] we may also be glorified with him he
[1:10:28] says for i reckon that the sufferings of
[1:10:29] this present time are not worthy
[1:10:31] to be compared to the glory which shall
[1:10:33] be revealed in us
[1:10:35] it doesn't say the glory that will be
[1:10:37] revealed in christ but the glory that
[1:10:38] will be revealed in you and i is that
[1:10:40] right
[1:10:40] for the earnest expectation of the
[1:10:42] creature waiteth for the manifestation
[1:10:44] of the sons of god
[1:10:46] what are they waiting on not the
[1:10:48] manifestation of christ but the
[1:10:50] manifestation of the sons of god
[1:10:52] i i'm here to tell you we've got to do
[1:10:54] something amen we can't just stay where
[1:10:56] we're at and expect the rapture to come
[1:10:58] to us right
[1:10:59] we've got to get closer to christ amen
[1:11:02] the
[1:11:02] everything is waiting for the
[1:11:03] manifestations of the sons of god so
[1:11:05] we've got to get to a point just like
[1:11:07] enoch that where one day
[1:11:08] we were just walking so close to him he
[1:11:10] just took us up amen
[1:11:13] amen do you love the lord amen i told
[1:11:15] you i was going to be really quick
[1:11:16] tonight so if the musicians would come
[1:11:18] and
[1:11:19] amen we'll just go ahead and read this i
[1:11:21] want to read this now he said
[1:11:23] and this is brother branham speaking in
[1:11:24] adoption in 1960 he says now we made
[1:11:26] known to us the mystery he says
[1:11:28] get the holy spirit on you sometime and
[1:11:30] and start running that
[1:11:32] and and just watch how it goes he said
[1:11:33] this afternoon i had all about 30
[1:11:35] minutes to study and just look the
[1:11:36] lesson over and
[1:11:37] maybe not i'll say he said maybe half of
[1:11:39] that 15 minutes between the time and
[1:11:41] i got into the old testament then back
[1:11:43] over in the new testament and
[1:11:44] tied something together and he said see
[1:11:46] there the mystery of his coming the
[1:11:47] mystery of his will and the mystery of
[1:11:49] us setting together
[1:11:51] he said remember it cannot be taught in
[1:11:53] any seminary it's a mystery
[1:11:54] you cannot know it by education by
[1:11:56] theology it's a mystery that's been
[1:11:58] hidden since the foundation of the world
[1:11:59] are waiting
[1:12:01] for the manifestation of the sons of god
[1:12:04] so everything that you know we can't
[1:12:06] look and say well you know
[1:12:08] and i don't want to have to like i said
[1:12:10] earlier whenever you preach against
[1:12:11] grace you have to go and preach to
[1:12:12] to this one and that one and say well
[1:12:14] you can't do this you can't do that so i
[1:12:15] don't want to say that
[1:12:16] it's just everything's waiting on us we
[1:12:18] know what has to happen in order for
[1:12:20] for the rapture to take place but we
[1:12:22] play a a
[1:12:23] enormous part in that to where we our
[1:12:26] desire i preached a long time ago
[1:12:28] preparing for a rapture
[1:12:30] and i believe as christians we ought to
[1:12:32] be preparing for a rapture
[1:12:34] not preparing for death not preparing
[1:12:36] for this or preparing for that but
[1:12:37] preparing
[1:12:38] for his return is that right now he says
[1:12:41] tell me my brother my sister when was
[1:12:42] the time the sons of god was ever to be
[1:12:44] manifested outside of this time now
[1:12:46] he said when were there is ever a time
[1:12:48] in history than the manifestation
[1:12:51] the manifest the time to deliver all
[1:12:52] nature he says nature
[1:12:54] itself is groaning waiting for the time
[1:12:56] of the manifestation he says why before
[1:12:58] the atonement was made
[1:12:59] before the holy ghost was ever poured
[1:13:01] out before the old testament and on down
[1:13:03] here
[1:13:04] he said there couldn't have been a
[1:13:05] manifestation he said it had to wait
[1:13:07] until this time
[1:13:08] he said now all things have been brought
[1:13:10] coming shaping up to a headstone
[1:13:13] to the manifestations of the sons of god
[1:13:15] coming back
[1:13:16] he said in the spirit god coming into
[1:13:18] these men he said so perfectly until the
[1:13:19] ministry will be so close
[1:13:21] like christ not like brother ben's not
[1:13:24] like brother
[1:13:24] donnie's not like brother brandon but
[1:13:26] like christ till it'll join him
[1:13:28] and his church together do you believe
[1:13:30] that today
[1:13:31] i mean that's what we're looking forward
[1:13:32] we want to get so close to christ that
[1:13:34] he just takes us home
[1:13:35] amen now i believe as sons and daughters
[1:13:37] of god we ought to put more
[1:13:39] we ought to put more respect and more
[1:13:41] time into praying about the service than
[1:13:43] we do about this or about that or
[1:13:45] worrying about this or that i'm
[1:13:46] preaching to myself big time because if
[1:13:48] you've got three little kids trying to
[1:13:49] go to church is probably the hardest
[1:13:51] thing you can ever do
[1:13:52] if you want anything to go wrong have a
[1:13:54] have kids before church and then
[1:13:56] just everything's going to go wrong that
[1:13:58] can go wrong amen do you believe that
[1:14:00] tonight
[1:14:01] but god still so let me back up because
[1:14:03] i have to
[1:14:04] play every minefield here that doesn't
[1:14:06] mean stay home still come
[1:14:08] push through press through the mark of
[1:14:10] the high calling amen
[1:14:11] we as sons and daughters of god we have
[1:14:13] the right and it's so amazing you know
[1:14:16] and i hate to say this but you look at
[1:14:17] all these people going to nominal
[1:14:19] churches and doing all these things and
[1:14:21] and and you look at the catholic church
[1:14:22] doing the penance and doing everything
[1:14:24] that they do
[1:14:25] in vain and they put so much work into
[1:14:28] it
[1:14:29] and you and i have the fullness of the
[1:14:31] godhead bodily the fullness of the word
[1:14:33] everything
[1:14:34] all the loose ends tied here today and
[1:14:36] how much work do we put into it amen
[1:14:38] i believe it convicts me many times if
[1:14:41] i'm convicted about anything it's about
[1:14:43] it's about praying to god for to speak
[1:14:45] to me in the service anymore
[1:14:46] is that right you may maybe that's not
[1:14:49] with you but it is with me is is to get
[1:14:51] into
[1:14:51] to try to come to church without being
[1:14:53] distracted by the world
[1:14:55] amen if there's ever a time i've been
[1:14:56] distracted it's in this day
[1:14:58] but god can bring us back in is that
[1:15:00] right
[1:15:01] amen do you love the lord let's just say
[1:15:03] a prayer you can play that softly
[1:15:04] everybody will be happy over there amen
[1:15:07] let's just just go to the word
[1:15:08] just go to word and prayer just for a
[1:15:10] few moments

[1:15:14] just thank you for allowing us to

[1:15:31] pray that they will just take
[1:15:33] foundation in the word of god lord and
[1:15:35] we just look at our lives we'll examine
[1:15:38] ourselves and lord when we leave here
