[18:01] camp. You can have your seats.
[18:05] I went to the enemy's camp and I took
[18:10] back what he stole from me. I took back
[18:15] what he stole from me. I took back what
[18:19] he stole from me. I went to the enemy's
[18:22] camp and I took back what he stole from
[18:27] me. He's under my feet. He's under my

[19:47] coming
[19:49] down." Well, I heard a voice from my God
[19:55] saying, "Satan, your kingdom of coming
[20:00] down." Oh. Satan, we're going to tear
[20:06] down. Satan, we're going to tear your
[20:09] kingdom

[20:26] down.
[20:30] church going to preach your kingdom
[20:33] down. Well, I heard a voice from heaven
[20:39] saying, "Preachers are going to bring

[21:40] Well, I heard a voice from my God
[21:45] saying, "Satan, your kingdom saying
[22:15] [Music]
[22:30] The
[22:31] sunrise in the morning and a mill star
[22:36] Tonight I hear the birds that can't stop
[22:40] singing
[22:44] hallelujah. I see his goodness when I
[22:47] fall down and his grace that picks me
[22:51] up. Every day I can't stop singing
[22:59] hallelujah. How can you not see God in
[23:03] every little thing, in every little
[23:06] moment? How can you not feel love? How
[23:11] can you not? How can you not? Cuz he's
[23:14] in the
[23:15] middle of every little thing and every
[23:20] little moment. How can you not see God?
[23:25] How can you not? How can you
[23:28] not
[23:30] sunset? I wonder if it's pain just for
[23:35] me. Nobody else can make a world so
[23:42] beautiful. How could I
[23:44] question his love when it's everywhere I
[23:49] go? Wherever I look, I find another
[23:57] miracle. How can you not see God in
[24:01] every little thing? In every little
[24:04] moment, how can you not feel
[24:07] love? How can you not? How can you not?
[24:12] Cuz he's in the
[24:13] middle of every little thing, in every
[24:18] little moment. How can you not see God?
[24:23] How can you not? How can you
[24:27] not? Everything is
[24:31] evidence, showing me that you
[24:34] exist. All creation
[24:37] singing
[24:38] [Music]
[24:41] hallelujah. Everything is
[24:45] evidence, showing me that you exist.
[24:49] All creation

[25:31] [Music]
[25:32] [Applause]
[25:50] not if Jared and the boys would come up
[25:52] to sing?
[26:35] Sweeter than the
[26:37] morning or the sound of the
[26:41] rain from the mouth of the preacher in a
[26:47] sinner the
[26:50] singer as a
[26:53] whisper louder in its refrain.
[26:58] on my
[26:59] lips for the rest of my days. There is
[27:05] something about the name of
[27:10] Jesus. It sounds like
[27:13] forgiveness. Sounds like amazing
[27:17] grace. It beckons my soul to sing
[27:22] forever.
[27:25] There's just something about that
[27:31] name. We pray it over family when we
[27:36] rise and when we
[27:39] sleep. We speak it over sorrow. When the
[27:44] soul is given
[27:46] peace, we'll speak it in the
[27:50] famine or in prosperity.
[27:53] [Music]
[27:54] May we never
[27:57] forget. He's all that we
[28:00] need. There is something about the name
[28:05] of
[28:08] Jesus. It sounds like forgiveness. It
[28:12] sounds like amazing
[28:15] grace. It beckons my soul to sing
[28:19] forever.
[28:22] There's just something about that
[28:28] name. There is still no
[28:33] other
[28:35] name. You still have the power to save.
[28:44] You can
[28:45] [Music]
[28:47] empty
[28:50] grave forever.
[28:53] Jesus is your
[28:58] name. There is still no
[29:02] other
[29:05] name. You still have the heart to say.
[29:13] You can
[29:14] empty
[29:16] any
[29:19] grave forever.
[29:21] Jesus is your
[29:26] name. There is something about the name
[29:31] of
[29:34] Jesus. It sounds like
[29:37] forgiveness. Sounds like amazing grace.
[29:42] It beckons my soul to sing
[29:47] forever. There is something about that
[29:54] name. There is something about that
[29:59] name.

[30:04] [Applause]
[30:21] Amen. There's something about that name,
[30:22] isn't there?
[30:27] We're going to go ahead and invite
[30:28] Brother Joel out. If you would stand
[30:29] with me.
[30:35] [Music]
[30:38] There's nothing like the
[30:42] presence. Nothing like the
[30:46] presence. Nothing like the presence of
[30:51] the
[30:53] Lord. There's nothing like the presence.
[30:59] Nothing like the
[31:02] presence. Nothing like the presence of
[31:07] the
[31:09] Lord. There's healing in the
[31:14] presence. Healing in the
[31:18] presence. Healing in the presence of the
[31:22] Lord.
[31:26] There's healing in the
[31:30] presence. Healing in the
[31:34] presence. Healing in the presence of the
[31:40] Lord. I'm
[31:44] free in his
[31:48] presence. And I'm
[31:50] [Applause]
[31:52] healed in his presence.
[31:56] I'm
[32:00] forgi. I'm not the
[32:04] same. I'm
[32:06] changed
[32:07] forever in his
[32:11] presence. Oh, there's nothing like the
[32:16] presence. Nothing like the presence.
[32:21] Nothing like the presence of the
[32:26] Lord. There's nothing like the
[32:31] presence. Nothing like the
[32:35] presence. Nothing like the presence of
[32:40] the
[32:42] Lord. And I'm
[32:46] free in his presence.
[32:51] I'm
[32:54] here in his
[32:58] presence. I'm
[33:02] forgive I'm not the
[33:06] same. I'm
[33:08] changed
[33:09] forever in his presence. Lord, I'm free.
[33:14] And I am
[33:15] [Applause]
[33:17] free in his
[33:20] presence. Oh, I am
[33:24] healed. In his
[33:28] presence, oh, I'm
[33:30] [Music]
[33:32] forgiven. I'm not the same.
[33:37] I'm
[33:38] changed
[33:40] forever in his
[33:43] presence. Amen. As they continue to play
[33:45] that softly, aren't you thankful for the
[33:47] presence of the Lord tonight? Amen. Are
[33:50] you happy to be in church? And I know
[33:52] it's a youth service and I'm going to
[33:53] try to uh speak more to the youth
[33:56] tonight, but you know, if you're here
[33:58] and you're an elder, you can just say,
[34:00] "Well, we're going to pull on the gift
[34:01] of God and and and and just pull for our
[34:03] young people." you know, in a time when
[34:05] it's just getting worse and worse. We
[34:07] can see how bad the world's getting, but
[34:09] we don't believe that uh it's getting
[34:12] any worse for the bride. We believe it's
[34:14] getting better because there's going to
[34:16] be a group that's getting ready to leave
[34:17] and they're going to be ready for it at
[34:19] the end time. So, we believe there's
[34:20] going to be a rapture group. And when I
[34:22] look at these young people, you think,
[34:24] you know, who who's going to be what
[34:26] generation? Well, if it doesn't come in
[34:28] yours, doesn't come in mine, it can come
[34:30] in theirs. And we know he's coming. Yes,
[34:33] sir. We want to be ready for it. So,
[34:35] whatever we have to do to get ready, if
[34:36] it's more focused on the youth or
[34:38] whatever it is, we want to just all of
[34:40] us be ready, but we want our young
[34:41] people to really just really be invested
[34:44] in this message and and we want to see
[34:46] their lives on fire for the gospel. If
[34:48] there's ministers tomorrow, these are
[34:49] the ministers. And if there's young
[34:52] ladies that's going to look like young
[34:54] ladies, this is the young ladies of
[34:55] tomorrow. So, we just want to just hold
[34:57] up the hold up the banner and and just
[35:00] continue to just promote this message to
[35:02] our young people. and pray that the Lord
[35:04] will really take control of their lives.
[35:05] I wonder if we could bow our heads. If
[35:07] you have a need on your heart tonight, I
[35:08] wonder if you just raise your hand to
[35:10] the Lord. He sees and knows every deed.
[35:13] Heavenly Father, as we come here
[35:15] tonight, I pray, Lord, that you would
[35:17] just move in a special way. Lord, move
[35:20] me out of the way so that I could speak
[35:21] to the young people, Lord, not what I
[35:23] would want to say, but words of life to
[35:26] them. Lord, I pray Lord that if your
[35:28] presence would just come down among us
[35:30] now and just settle us in. And I pray
[35:33] Lord, Lord, you'd take control and
[35:35] change this service to go any direction
[35:37] you would want it to go. Lord, if
[35:39] there's one among us that's not saved or
[35:41] not filled with the Holy Ghost, I pray
[35:42] this would be their service
[35:44] tonight. Lord, I ask that you wouldn't
[35:46] let anything hinder you. Remove all
[35:48] hindrances from our thoughts, Lord, or
[35:51] from our our minds that would try to
[35:54] hold us from a blessing tonight. move
[35:56] upon our young people, Lord. Move aside
[35:58] the tiredness, we pray and just anoint
[36:01] every year and Lord, anoint myself. I
[36:04] pray, Lord, you would just move me
[36:06] aside, Lord, so you could use me
[36:07] tonight. Lord, I pray for this
[36:09] congregation. We pray for every need,
[36:11] every sickness, every everything. May
[36:13] there be a testimony come, Lord, out of
[36:15] the service tonight. We pray you move
[36:17] upon us now in Jesus' name. Amen. And
[36:21] the church said, "Amen." Amen. Well, uh,
[36:24] what can we say about the service this
[36:26] morning? Wasn't that
[36:33] good. And, uh, what can we say? It was
[36:35] good. It was very good. And, uh, that'll
[36:38] be all musicians. I'm sorry. Uh, I I was
[36:41] so nice. We had all the youth up here
[36:43] tonight. And, uh, and Brother
[36:45] Bill, he's younger than he looks. He's
[36:48] not a day over 29.
[36:50] and he he felt young, so he thought he'd
[36:53] just get on up here and identify as a
[36:55] young person and well, that's okay. I
[36:59] mean, he he's just testifying that he's
[37:00] he's young.
[37:04] And and uh you know, you don't you may
[37:05] not see it yet, but one day it'll
[37:08] happen. So, we thank the Lord for
[37:10] brother. Good to have every one of you
[37:11] here tonight. I'm sorry you have to put
[37:12] up with me, but um if you have your
[37:15] Bibles, turn to John chapter 6. John
[37:18] chapter 6. And I don't have a lot of
[37:20] notes tonight. So if I run a little low
[37:22] on notes, I'm gonna step down here and
[37:23] get their notes from this
[37:26] morning. Oh, the panic. Panic. Some of
[37:30] those are good notes and some of them
[37:31] are talking about who they like. So we
[37:34] just preach from them and we can preach
[37:36] from either side. Doesn't
[37:37] matter. I told them in the back, I said,
[37:40] "If I run out of notes, I'm gonna walk
[37:41] down here and get all their notes from
[37:42] this morning and just preach from them."
[37:43] And I bet we could preach from the Those
[37:48] notes, bless your hearts. Don't stop
[37:49] taking notes on my account. John chapter
[37:51] 6 and verse uh let's start with verse
[37:55] 43. John chapter 6 and verse 43. Are you
[37:59] happy to be a Christian tonight? Amen.
[38:01] Amen. And John chapter 6:43 says, "Jesus
[38:05] therefore answered and said unto them,
[38:07] Murmur not among
[38:09] yourselves. No man can come to me except
[38:11] the Father which hath sent me. draw him,
[38:14] and I will raise him up at the last
[38:17] days. It is written in the prophets, and
[38:20] they shall all be taught of God. Every
[38:21] man therefore that hath heard and hath
[38:24] learned of the Father cometh unto me.
[38:26] Not that any man hath seen the Father,
[38:27] save he which is of God, he hath seen
[38:30] the Father. Verily, verily, I say unto
[38:31] you, he that believeth on me hath
[38:34] everlasting life. And I want to just uh
[38:38] right over in Romans chapter 3, if we'll
[38:40] go there quickly, Romans chapter 3 and
[38:44] verse 10. Romans chapter 3 and verse
[38:47] 10. Say amen when you get it. Amen. Some
[38:51] of you say, "Well, I've got it and I can
[38:52] see it on the board, so we're good."
[38:53] Romans chapter 3, verse 10. As it is
[38:56] written, there is none righteous, know
[38:58] not one. There is none that
[38:59] understandeth. There is none that
[39:02] seeketh after God. And you may be
[39:05] seated. May the Lord add his blessings
[39:07] to the word tonight. Tonight, if I could
[39:10] have just a thought. Uh before you were
[39:13] born, God had a plan. Before you were
[39:16] born, Brother Landon, God had a plan.
[39:18] You were God knew you before you were
[39:20] before your parents knew you.
[39:23] Well, somebody say, "Manner, this is
[39:25] going to be a really long
[39:27] night." You say, "Well, that ain't
[39:29] true." Well, it is true because God's
[39:31] thoughts are eternal. And if you are if
[39:33] you were in God's thoughts, then you
[39:36] cannot perish because you are a part of
[39:39] God's thoughts. You are the expressions
[39:42] of God's thoughts. So God thought of uh
[39:45] brother he thought he thought of he
[39:46] thought of brother Landon and he thought
[39:47] of brother Jaden and he he thought of
[39:50] but he knew you would be sitting here.
[39:51] He knew who you were before your parents
[39:54] ever named you. He knew you before they
[39:56] even thought about you. Before they ever
[39:58] knew each other, God knew who you would
[40:01] be. Right. And so God has a purpose for
[40:04] us. How many believes that tonight? God
[40:06] has a plan for us. And so, but before he
[40:09] could make you, he had to know that you
[40:12] had a purpose for this age. And I want
[40:13] to try to get to this just as simple as
[40:15] I can tonight. But he had an age that
[40:18] would be called the age of Leoa. It
[40:19] would be the last age of the church. And
[40:22] in that age, he would have a group of
[40:24] people that would have a message. And in
[40:26] this message, there would have to be a
[40:27] group of people that would have to
[40:29] overcome obstacle after obstacle and
[40:31] spirit after spirit. They would have to
[40:34] overcome all kinds of temptations. They
[40:36] would have to overcome and they would
[40:38] have to fight. Listen, church, this is
[40:40] the hardest of all ages because
[40:42] technology is is not all good. And and
[40:44] your friends, they're not always going
[40:46] to be good friends. And and listen, I
[40:48] mean, there's a lot of bad things that
[40:49] are happening. But what we do have is we
[40:52] do have an absolute. Amen. We have
[40:54] something to go back to. And we have to
[40:56] know that where we came from was God and
[40:59] where we're going is God. We are eternal
[41:01] beings if we're in God. Can you say
[41:03] amen? Because what what happens is this
[41:06] flesh will lay down. This flesh will
[41:08] die. But before this flesh, before there
[41:12] ever was a flesh, you were already in
[41:14] the thoughts of God. You can take it all
[41:15] the way back to the book of Genesis
[41:17] where where God God was there and he he
[41:19] he decided he saw the earth and it was
[41:22] void. There was nothing. It was it was
[41:24] empty. It was it was just everything. It
[41:26] was darkness covered the face of the
[41:27] earth before there was light. But then
[41:29] God made a light. But before there could
[41:32] be a light made, God had to have it in
[41:34] his mind of what light would look like.
[41:37] I hope you're with me so far. So before
[41:39] God could make an animal, he knew what
[41:40] the animal would be and what the animal
[41:43] would do. And then he knew and then he
[41:45] he made all these things. But God wanted
[41:46] fellowship, too. And so then he made
[41:49] man. And he he wanted to be worshiped as
[41:51] God. The animals couldn't worship him as
[41:53] God because they couldn't stand there.
[41:55] And the angels was worshiping, but he
[41:57] wanted something a little more than
[41:59] that. He wanted fellowship with a man.
[42:01] And so he made you, right? And so when
[42:04] he made you, he had it in his mind of
[42:06] what you would be. God knows all things.
[42:08] Do we believe that tonight? God knows
[42:11] what you're going to do. God knows your
[42:12] occupation. Many times as a young
[42:14] person, you don't know what you're going
[42:15] to be when you grow up. God already
[42:16] knows. And you don't know who you're
[42:18] going to marry. God already knows. It
[42:20] ain't always who you think you're going
[42:21] to marry.
[42:23] Well, can you say amen? You all get, you
[42:26] know, when you're a young person, you
[42:27] want the coolest kid. You know, the
[42:29] young girls, they want the best looking
[42:31] boy. And sometimes it's the nerd that
[42:33] gets the girl. And, you know, the boys,
[42:36] they think, well, I just want this
[42:37] little princess and and they end up with
[42:39] a tomboy, you know, and so you all kinds
[42:42] of stuff. You you you you think you got
[42:44] your life figured out. I want to go
[42:45] ahead and tell you something. God knows.
[42:47] And he I wonder if he don't step back
[42:49] and just laugh sometimes about the
[42:51] decisions we make he knew we'd make. But
[42:54] we didn't think we'd ever make that
[42:55] decision, but God did. So we worry about
[42:58] things as young people. We worry about
[42:59] our jobs. We worry about who we're going
[43:01] to marry. And do you realize that God
[43:03] has it all in control? Because before
[43:06] you were born, God already had your plan
[43:08] laid out, right? everything you would
[43:10] do, every every move you made, every
[43:13] time you batted your eye, God knew you
[43:16] would do it. And you say, "Well, I fell.
[43:19] I failed God. I fell down. I I I and I I
[43:22] made mistakes." God knew you'd make the
[43:24] mistake. And that's why he provided a
[43:26] way for you to overcome. And that's why
[43:28] he provided a blood that we heard about
[43:29] this morning. Because there's something
[43:31] more to this than us just being put out
[43:34] here in this big earth and deciding
[43:36] we're going to make it however we want
[43:37] to make it. Because if you really could
[43:40] be in the driver's seat, you'd make all
[43:41] kinds of mistakes. You You've seen the
[43:43] bumper stickers. Jesus is my co-pilot.
[43:45] If he's your co-pilot, you're making a
[43:47] lot of mistakes. You need to move out
[43:49] the seat and let him in the driver's
[43:50] seat because if he's taking the wheel,
[43:53] say, "Jesus, take the wheel. Jesus takes
[43:55] the wheel." And then he can guide you
[43:57] and direct you in the path he's already
[43:59] laid out for you. And then our young
[44:02] people, listen, it takes away a lot of
[44:04] the worry because a lot of times in
[44:06] life, we think, well, how's it going to
[44:07] how's it going to happen? You you get to
[44:09] be mid20s and you think, am I ever going
[44:11] to get married? Yes, if God wants you
[44:13] to, he he'll provide that person for
[44:15] you, man. But we put a limit on God. If
[44:17] I'm not married by 18, well, then there
[44:19] just ain't nobody for me. Well, come on,
[44:20] church. I know when you're 18 and you
[44:23] want to get married and half the time
[44:24] you ain't got no business getting
[44:25] married. And and and then we got these
[44:29] little kids down here, these these young
[44:30] ones. They're not little kids. They're
[44:31] they're young ladies and and you look at
[44:33] them and you know they they don't
[44:34] realize that in 20 years they could be
[44:36] mothers. Yeah.
[44:39] And and you know and they're scared to
[44:41] death of it right now. But you give them
[44:42] five years and they're all going to be,
[44:44] oh, I want I want to marry somebody. You
[44:45] know, I want to get married. We'll come
[44:46] with with marriage comes responsibility.
[44:48] Right.
[44:50] More responsibility than you'll ever
[44:52] imagine. You know, the wedding's pretty,
[44:55] but you got to get ready for more than
[44:56] the wedding. That's right. And you
[44:58] think, "Well, it's so stressful. Well, I
[44:59] just I just can't make it. The wedding
[45:01] was so hard. And that's the easiest
[45:02] thing you'll do in your married
[45:05] life. It It just gets It gets Well, I'm
[45:08] just going to tell you, nobody want to
[45:10] get married after you leave here today.
[45:11] It gets
[45:13] worse. Been married for a long
[45:17] time. And uh it it you know, it's
[45:21] wonderful. But what you'll find out
[45:24] is you learn to love each other through
[45:26] the hard times, right? But you young
[45:29] people, if you think everything's going
[45:30] to be easy for you, well, you better
[45:31] just not get married until you
[45:33] understand that life life is not all
[45:35] easy. It's not easy street. We don't
[45:38] live on easy street. I think there is an
[45:39] easy street over here in Ash Flat or
[45:41] Highland. And I know some people live on
[45:43] it. And I guarantee you it ain't easy
[45:45] street for them.
[45:48] But Lord, I hope they don't
[45:52] watch. Like, brother Joel, you're a
[45:54] loose cannon. I know. I told brother
[45:56] Ben, I said, "If you really want to be
[45:57] scared, take the streaming off." And uh
[46:00] keeps me honest. But you know, listen,
[46:02] before there was
[46:04] anything, God knew what would happen,
[46:07] right? So before he ever, so when when
[46:11] Romans here, try to get back to my notes
[46:13] if I can. In Romans the third chapter,
[46:15] he said, "There's none that understand
[46:16] it. There's none that seeketh after
[46:17] God." Now, I want you to notice that and
[46:20] that can sound uh contradicting to you
[46:22] young people because you can say, "Well,
[46:24] nobody seeks after God." Well, how do I
[46:25] seek the Holy Ghost? How do I seek God?
[46:27] Well, that's because you do seek God,
[46:29] but not until God places a desire in
[46:32] your heart to seek him, right? So,
[46:34] before So, just think about this. If you
[46:36] have a desire to seek God, God already
[46:39] found you. If you have a desire for the
[46:42] Holy Ghost, it's a good sign because God
[46:44] already knew you. I'm gonna come down
[46:46] here. Wake some of y'all up. All right.
[46:49] Think about it. If you want the Holy
[46:51] Ghost, God's already chosen you to get
[46:54] the Holy Ghost. Think about it, though.
[46:56] You know, it makes it takes a lot of the
[46:58] pressure off. You say, "Well, I've been
[46:59] seeking the Holy Ghost for years." Well,
[47:00] the desire that you have to get the Holy
[47:03] Ghost is from God. And so, that could
[47:05] that should give you confidence that God
[47:07] has already found me. God has already
[47:10] placed Come on, church. God already
[47:12] wanted you before you wanted God. So God
[47:15] saw somebody that needed the Holy Ghost,
[47:17] put a desire in their heart for the Holy
[47:19] Ghost, and now you're running after God
[47:21] because God already found you. Brother
[47:23] Brandon would say in the Garden of Eden,
[47:24] he said, "It wasn't man running after
[47:26] God. They were running from God because
[47:28] they had made mistakes. They'd messed
[47:30] up." And so and so they were running
[47:32] away from God. They wanted to hide from
[47:33] God. That's the nature of man, to hide
[47:35] from God. And young people, when you
[47:37] when you make a mistake and you don't
[47:39] want your parents to find out, you want
[47:40] to hide in your room or Well, come on,
[47:42] somebody. You want you want to hide. You
[47:44] don't want to come out and just confess
[47:45] it, but the best thing you can do is
[47:48] just go ahead and give it to Jesus
[47:50] because he already knows what you did.
[47:53] And he already knows how to fix that
[47:55] problem in your life. He already knows
[47:57] you're going to get the Holy Ghost.
[47:59] Don't run from him, but seek after him.
[48:01] You say, "Well, I I want to." Well, if
[48:03] you have a want to, that's a good sign
[48:05] that he already chose you for the Holy
[48:07] Ghost. Now, Brother Landon, I remember
[48:09] last year at youth camp and and you
[48:11] know, Brother Landon, he's he's kind of
[48:12] quiet, right? Yeah, he's kind of quiet.
[48:15] And and not I'm not trying to pick on
[48:17] anybody, but if you're on the front row,
[48:18] then you may get picked on. And so, if
[48:21] you're sitting up here at your own risk
[48:24] and but you know, Brother Landon went to
[48:27] youth camp last year, and I'll be honest
[48:28] with you, I when he went, I didn't know
[48:30] if he was seeking the Lord. He never
[48:31] told me he was seeking the Lord. He
[48:33] never come out and said, "Well, I want
[48:34] the hol." He never said any of that. But
[48:36] you know what happened was the Holy
[48:37] Spirit come down in a meeting and the
[48:39] next thing you know he didn't hardly
[48:40] know what was going on because God knew
[48:42] he needed it more than he knew he needed
[48:44] it. Well, can you say amen? Sometimes
[48:47] you go into a service and you don't even
[48:48] want to be there. But God shows
[48:51] up. God already put the desire there.
[48:54] And if God has placed a desire in your
[48:56] heart, that's enough reason to praise
[48:58] him tonight. Amen. Because he put a
[49:00] desire to serve him. Listen, church, I a
[49:03] lot of times we'll preach of people
[49:04] going to church, not going to church,
[49:05] all this stuff. You know, you listen.
[49:06] I'll tell you. I I I'm big about going
[49:08] to church, but I want to tell you
[49:09] something. It's more about the desire to
[49:11] be there. You got some people there
[49:13] don't want to be there. They need a
[49:15] desire to be in the house of God. Amen.
[49:17] Somebody can't go. And you and you know,
[49:19] everybody else is like, where they at?
[49:20] And they're judging them. Well, if
[49:22] there's a desire in their heart to be
[49:23] there, they're better off than the
[49:24] person sitting here that won't surrender
[49:26] to God. I say tonight, let's surrender
[49:29] because he already brought me this far.
[49:31] And he did not bring me this far to
[49:32] leave me. But he brought me this far
[49:35] because he knew he could trust me with
[49:36] his word. He knew he could trust me with
[49:38] this message. And so he brought me this
[49:40] far. And and and and he had a purpose
[49:43] for you. Can you say amen? Amen. So,
[49:46] Brother Brand would go on like this. I
[49:47] want to get to a few quotes here. You
[49:49] young people, you you know, maybe if you
[49:51] don't listen to a lot of tapes at home,
[49:53] I I want you to get some of these quotes
[49:54] here. And if you want to, I know your
[49:56] parents are okay with you listening to
[49:58] the message. Brother Brandon would say
[50:00] it like this. No man seeks after God.
[50:02] God seeks after man. Man in his nature
[50:05] is rebellion against God.
[50:08] Think about it. In your nature, you want
[50:11] to rebel against what God wants to do
[50:13] for you. All right. God wants you to do
[50:16] this and you don't want to do that. It's
[50:18] rebellion. It's what we It's what we
[50:19] It's It's carnality. It's it's it's the
[50:21] flesh that is trying to control your
[50:23] life. That's right. Can you say amen?
[50:25] Amen. But he said it's rebellion against
[50:27] God. He's against
[50:29] God, but God loves the man. Aren't you
[50:32] thankful for it? Amen. God loves the
[50:34] man. Since the fall in the Garden of
[50:35] Eden, God has still been calling for his
[50:38] child. And he calls to him through the
[50:40] thunder, through the lightning, through
[50:41] the setting of the sun, through the
[50:43] preaching of the gospel, through the
[50:45] signs and wonders, through the prophets,
[50:46] through miracles, through visions. God
[50:48] speaks to his people. So when a preacher
[50:51] is standing here, I want to try to get
[50:52] this to you young people just the best I
[50:54] can. When a preacher is standing here,
[50:56] they are not just preaching to hear
[50:58] themselves talk. And they're not just
[51:00] preaching just so you can hear them
[51:02] talk. But that is actually the avenue
[51:04] that God has chosen to speak to your
[51:07] heart. That's what a prophet said and
[51:10] it's true. So we we don't want to think
[51:12] that we know more than God. So I'm going
[51:14] to go to church and I'm going to check
[51:15] out. No, that's the wrong attitude.
[51:18] Can you say amen? What we need tonight
[51:20] is to really understand if we're here
[51:22] and God is here to meet us here, then we
[51:25] need to give everything we've got to him
[51:27] because he found me. He brought me here.
[51:30] He set me in the seat I'm sitting in. I
[51:32] say give praise to God. If you showed
[51:34] up, you might as well give him praise.
[51:36] If you showed up, you might as well give
[51:38] him your attention. If you showed up and
[51:40] you need the Holy Ghost, you might as
[51:41] well get it while you're here. Amen.
[51:43] Because he wants to give it to you.
[51:45] That's right. Amen. A lot of times it's
[51:47] our own thinking that holds us back. But
[51:49] you know, before there was a desire for
[51:52] the Holy Ghost, the Holy Ghost was
[51:54] already here. That's right. Amen. Can
[51:56] you say amen? Before there was, Brother
[51:59] Brandham says, before there was a fin on
[52:01] a fish's back, there was an ocean or
[52:03] water for that fish to swim in. See, God
[52:05] works on both ends. When you have the
[52:08] desire for the Holy Ghost, don't you
[52:09] think you can't get it? It's just as
[52:12] good as the water the fish can swim in.
[52:14] If you have a desire for it, that is God
[52:16] that placed that desire. Right? Come on,
[52:19] church. You young people, I hope you're
[52:21] with me. Y'all know how to say amen.
[52:25] Woo, that was quiet. You know, at your
[52:28] ages, you could do a lot better than
[52:30] that. I've heard you over next door.
[52:33] I've heard you out here in the
[52:35] yard. And I know the deacons will get
[52:37] mad at you if you're bad in church, but
[52:39] if you say amen in church, they won't
[52:40] touch you.
[52:42] I promise they're going to be like,
[52:44] "Wow, how good was how good was that?"
[52:46] You know, you say, "Well, I don't know a
[52:48] lot of stuff."
[52:49] Well, I'd rather Jonah's my best a
[52:52] maner.
[52:53] Hallelujah. He uh he don't have a clue
[52:55] what I'm saying. But but uh he amens me
[53:00] anyway. I can say something real stupid.
[53:02] Oh, well, here while we're here and you
[53:04] guys are about to fall asleep on me, I'm
[53:05] going to say something. You know, I
[53:08] heard a story by a preacher one time
[53:11] about a hot
[53:13] dog. And now,
[53:17] sorry, I'm just trying to get your
[53:19] attention. And he said he went into this
[53:22] fellowship hall and he said he smelled
[53:24] the aroma of a hot
[53:26] dog. And he said before there was a
[53:28] desire for a hot dog. Well, hallelujah.
[53:32] There was a hot dog for him.
[53:35] Now, that's pretty simple. But if
[53:38] there's a desire there for something,
[53:40] that means there is, listen, did you
[53:41] know if you want the Holy Ghost, that
[53:43] means your your soul knows that it needs
[53:46] the Holy Ghost? And you say, "Well, my
[53:48] soul's never experienced it." Do you
[53:50] realize that that your soul knows what
[53:52] it's all about because God has already
[53:55] connected with your soul? That's right.
[53:56] And he's waiting for you to surrender
[53:58] what you have to him. See, it's not
[54:01] about you say, "Well, I I'm I'm
[54:03] baptized. I'm saved." Listen, but don't
[54:05] think, you know, well, I didn't receive
[54:06] the Holy Ghost when I come up out of the
[54:08] water. Come on, church. You don't don't
[54:10] put it on an emotion. Well, I didn't
[54:11] fall out in the prayer line. That don't
[54:12] mean you didn't get it.
[54:15] I didn't scream. I didn't shout. I
[54:16] didn't speak with tongues. Since when is
[54:18] that the evidence of the Holy Ghost?
[54:20] Watch your life. Watch how you start to
[54:22] act different. I mean, I watch I've
[54:24] watched not not to pick on you, buddy,
[54:26] but I've watched Brother Landon and I've
[54:27] watched his desire change. Why? because
[54:30] something on the inside of him has
[54:32] changed from what he wanted in before he
[54:34] got the Holy Ghost to what he wanted
[54:36] after he got the Holy Ghost. Can you say
[54:38] amen? And so our young people, what
[54:40] you'll see is you may not see an
[54:42] overnight change, but what you'll see is
[54:44] they are changing their wants and their
[54:46] desires and they start wanting to please
[54:48] God. Come on, church. That don't mean
[54:50] they're going to clean their rooms every
[54:52] ser every time they get home. And that
[54:54] don't mean that they're going to be the
[54:55] the best kid in your home. No. Because
[54:57] the devil is going to fight our young
[54:58] people and they're going to still be
[55:01] kids.
[55:02] Come on, church. I know some of you
[55:04] elders are saying, "Well, the kids,
[55:05] they're, you know, they're just rotten."
[55:08] Well, you were, too.
[55:12] You just don't remember.
[55:14] That's what age does.
[55:17] Takes away all the bad.
[55:22] But you think about it, you know, we're
[55:23] we're all we're all stupid at some
[55:25] point. Amen.
[55:27] All
[55:29] y'all and me too. You know, I've been
[55:32] stupid before. Rarely, but it's been
[55:35] stupid. You know, and and and you know,
[55:37] you think about it. You ever done
[55:38] anything wrong and you felt really bad
[55:40] about it?
[55:42] You know what that is? Some of you that
[55:44] have received the Holy Ghost be like, "I
[55:45] used to be able to do this and now I
[55:46] can't do it." You know what that is?
[55:49] That's the Holy Ghost. And you're
[55:51] saying, "Well, I didn't get a work up. I
[55:52] didn't get an emotion." No, it's as
[55:53] simple as that. God has changed your
[55:55] desire to match his desire. He wanted
[55:58] good things for you. He wanted you to be
[56:00] an overcomer and now you want to be an
[56:02] overcomer. Come on, church. Now you want
[56:05] the good things of God. Now you want
[56:07] what he wants for you because you've
[56:09] given yourself. Listen, what you wanted
[56:11] before you got saved was different than
[56:13] what you Come on, church. You know what
[56:15] I'm talking about. Some of you young
[56:17] people, some of you middle-aged people,
[56:18] you know what I'm talking about. You
[56:20] remember those years not that long ago
[56:21] when you wanted to live like the devil
[56:23] and you wanted to serve the world, but
[56:25] then there was something changed on the
[56:26] inside of you. Well, can you say amen?
[56:29] Amen. That is what the Holy Ghost does
[56:31] for us. We're putting too much on a
[56:33] sensation and too much on an emotion and
[56:36] too much on a camp experience. But what
[56:38] what I tell you, it's good to get the
[56:40] experience. It's good to have the
[56:42] emotion, but what you hold to is the
[56:45] desire that changes on the inside of
[56:47] you. Amen. These these elders in our
[56:49] church are not still going to church
[56:51] because they feel like going to church.
[56:52] They're going to church because there's
[56:54] a desire. There's a ferveny to to to
[56:57] serve God in their hearts. And that is
[56:59] what happens to a young person that gets
[57:01] the Holy Ghost. That's what that's what
[57:03] happens because they're no longer
[57:05] thinking of uh you know, you know, of
[57:08] things of the world. That's that that's
[57:09] not their focus. And sports loses a
[57:11] little bit of focus. I'm not saying
[57:13] anything against sports. I'm what I'm
[57:15] saying is that doesn't become that's not
[57:16] your main thing. You know, you you think
[57:18] of good things. You think of you think
[57:20] of godly things. And and listen, church,
[57:22] I'm not I'm not trying to be legalistic
[57:24] here tonight. What I'm trying to tell
[57:24] you is there's a desire on the inside of
[57:27] you to serve God if God has come into
[57:30] your soul.
[57:32] And so, Brother Brandham would say it
[57:34] like this. He said, "Before there was a
[57:35] palm tree to grow on the earth, there
[57:37] had to be an earth first or there'd be
[57:39] no palm tree to grow." Amen. He said,
[57:42] "If you believe in divine healing, the
[57:44] power of God, before he said, before
[57:46] there's something created, a desire in
[57:48] your heart before there could be a
[57:50] creation, there has to be a creator."
[57:52] Right? Can you say amen? Amen. He said,
[57:54] "There you are." When the Holy Ghost
[57:56] created in your heart a desire to see
[57:58] the power of God work in this city here,
[58:00] there's got to be a power of God
[58:02] somewhere.
[58:03] Come on, church. If you actually want
[58:06] God to move in this service, then
[58:08] there's a move of God for you. If you
[58:10] want the Holy Ghost, the Holy Ghost is
[58:12] here for you. If you want healing
[58:14] tonight, the healing is here for you.
[58:17] The very fact that you have a desire for
[58:19] it show there shows it's here. Amen.
[58:22] Yes, sir. Can you say amen? Brother
[58:25] Brandham said, he said, "Is that right?"
[58:26] He said, "Before there's a creation,
[58:28] there had to be a creator. There you
[58:29] are. When the Holy Ghost created in your
[58:30] heart a desire to see the power of God,
[58:32] then it's here." And he goes on, he
[58:34] said, he he said, "There's got to be a
[58:35] power of God somewhere who will break
[58:37] down the shackles and come in with the
[58:39] powers of God, move for healing,
[58:40] salvation, the pouring out of the Holy
[58:42] Spirit on everybody the way we're
[58:44] expecting it." I tell you, I I I I I'm
[58:48] sick and tired of coming with low
[58:49] expectations to the house of God. We
[58:51] need to come with expectations that this
[58:53] is going to be my service. Young people,
[58:56] don't come to church thinking that the
[58:57] Holy Ghost might be at the next youth
[58:58] camp. It needs to be now. There needs to
[59:01] be an urgency in your heart to receive
[59:02] the Holy Ghost. It may be at the next
[59:04] youth camp, but it may be on Wednesday
[59:06] night. It may be on Sunday afternoon.
[59:09] What you have to do is let that desire,
[59:11] listen, let let that desire take over
[59:13] one time. Let that desire in your heart
[59:15] really, really grow. And and and you
[59:17] know, when the desire of God is there, I
[59:19] say as as parents, we need to really get
[59:21] behind our young people and we need to
[59:23] start nurturing that and watering that.
[59:25] If they have a desire for the things of
[59:27] God, let's go ahead and help that thing
[59:28] grow. Because don't ever let that desire
[59:31] to serve God die. Well, can you say
[59:33] amen, young people and old people alike?
[59:35] Amen. Because even it don't matter how
[59:37] old you are or how young you are or I
[59:40] don't care if you're anywhere in
[59:41] between. Amen. If God has chosen you and
[59:44] has put a desire in your heart, then we
[59:46] need to lay aside every sin and every
[59:48] weight and every besetting thing and run
[59:51] this race with patience and let God be
[59:54] God. We need to let God take control of
[59:56] our young people. Well, can you say
[59:58] amen? I think we've let we've let the
[1:00:00] devil come in and tell us that, well,
[1:00:02] they're just, you know, they got to be a
[1:00:03] certain age to get saved. No. I I think
[1:00:06] we need to go ahead and from a young age
[1:00:07] go ahead and let these pe show these
[1:00:09] young people you can be saved at a young
[1:00:11] age. You can live for God at a young
[1:00:13] age. You don't have to go out in the
[1:00:15] world and have the scars of the world.
[1:00:18] That's right. It's hard to it's harder
[1:00:20] to overcome those scars because the
[1:00:22] scars cause complexes and and fears and
[1:00:26] and and it's amazing to me the things I
[1:00:29] went through. And I didn't go through
[1:00:30] half of what a lot of people have went
[1:00:31] through, but just the the few scars I
[1:00:34] had. I would say it like this. I don't
[1:00:36] want my kids to experience that. And so
[1:00:39] what do I in order to change that? I've
[1:00:41] got to change the way I'm raising them.
[1:00:43] Now, well, I hope you're hearing me. You
[1:00:46] say, "Well, I'm going to just I'm just
[1:00:47] going to let them live like the world
[1:00:48] and then when they're a certain age,
[1:00:49] then they can make their own decision."
[1:00:51] Then you're going to let them kids get
[1:00:53] scarred and complexes and all kinds of
[1:00:55] problems and messed up.
[1:00:57] Listen, church. Brother Brandham talks
[1:00:59] about parent delinquents. We need to be
[1:01:00] so on fire ourselves as parents that our
[1:01:04] children actually have a chance in this
[1:01:06] end time. And so our young people can
[1:01:08] come to the house of God and know how to
[1:01:10] receive from God. Amen. Our young people
[1:01:12] need to know how to pray. Our young
[1:01:14] people need to know how to worship.
[1:01:16] Amen. Well, they're just worshiping like
[1:01:17] another young person. I'd rather see
[1:01:19] that.
[1:01:22] Well, y'all got quiet on me. What kind
[1:01:24] of an example are we setting our kids
[1:01:26] for worship? Come on now. Come on,
[1:01:28] church. Well, my kids don't say amen. I
[1:01:30] wish they would. And you've sat there
[1:01:31] and had
[1:01:34] and you quiet, you know. Well, praise
[1:01:36] the Lord.
[1:01:37] Can you say amen tonight? Amen. There is
[1:01:41] a desire to please God if he placed a
[1:01:44] desire in your heart to serve him.
[1:01:46] Right? Brother Bram would go on like
[1:01:48] this and I won't hold you long tonight,
[1:01:50] but brother Bram talks about deep
[1:01:51] calling of the deep.
[1:01:53] By the way, I think our young people, if
[1:01:55] if if your young people have not seen
[1:01:56] that video, I think you should show it
[1:01:58] to them. Yeah. Um and I'll tell you why.
[1:02:01] Because I think that'll show them that
[1:02:02] this was not just a message that was
[1:02:04] done in a corner. This was not a message
[1:02:06] that was done just for show. This was
[1:02:09] not just another faith healer that came
[1:02:11] along. Come on, church. If you've ever
[1:02:13] watched that, I guarantee you right now,
[1:02:15] it's going to change your life because
[1:02:17] there's nothing about that that can be
[1:02:18] proven by an intellectual mind. Right?
[1:02:21] And we have it on video. We don't even
[1:02:23] have the Bible stories on video. We wish
[1:02:25] we did. The Chosen is actually not
[1:02:28] realistic. I didn't know if y'all knew
[1:02:29] that.
[1:02:31] It's good, but that was not taken 2,000
[1:02:34] years ago. That was new film. Do you
[1:02:36] know God was actually working in the
[1:02:38] deep video right there? It was captured
[1:02:42] live in front of all those people. And
[1:02:45] you can look at that and say that was
[1:02:47] that was Jesus proving himself again in
[1:02:48] our generation. That ought to be real to
[1:02:50] our young people, right? Come on,
[1:02:52] church. You know why we get cold on God?
[1:02:54] Bec- and and then we then we wonder why
[1:02:56] our kids do the same thing is because we
[1:02:58] don't actually move when God moves us.
[1:03:01] We've decided that, you know, we man,
[1:03:05] it's getting tough here. But I'm going
[1:03:07] to go and tell you something. I You want
[1:03:08] a good service? Be the good service.
[1:03:13] You You want everybody to shout in
[1:03:14] church and you look around, why ain't
[1:03:15] they shouting? Why ain't they clapping?
[1:03:18] If you are, then you won't even notice
[1:03:20] them, right?
[1:03:21] Come on, church.
[1:03:24] Yes, sir. What we need to do is just go
[1:03:26] ahead and get our own selves out of the
[1:03:27] way and let the desire of God in our
[1:03:31] hearts grow and say, "If God has led me
[1:03:33] here to worship, I'm going to worship."
[1:03:36] Amen. If God has put a desire in these
[1:03:38] young people's hearts for the Holy
[1:03:39] Ghost, then us older people or
[1:03:41] middle-aged people or whatever you are
[1:03:43] need to get behind this thing with all
[1:03:44] of our hearts and say, "Lord, I'm going
[1:03:46] to pray for that young person. I'm going
[1:03:48] to pray for that young youth meeting.
[1:03:51] Listen, church, they need our prayers.
[1:03:52] They need our support. They need us to
[1:03:54] be behind them because the devil is
[1:03:57] chasing our young people. The devil is
[1:03:59] after their style and their dress. And
[1:04:01] the devil is after the way they act. I
[1:04:03] think we need to be on fire for God so
[1:04:06] that they can see an example of how to
[1:04:08] act in the house of God. Well, can you
[1:04:11] say amen? Amen. And it's one thing to go
[1:04:13] to youth camp and you see everybody in a
[1:04:14] in an atmosphere of worship and in an
[1:04:16] atmosphere of praise and and it's just a
[1:04:18] wonderful time. And I know you you can't
[1:04:20] replicate that because you ain't all you
[1:04:22] ain't got all the same kids and and all
[1:04:23] those things. But what you can have is
[1:04:25] the same God in the servicemen.
[1:04:28] You ain't got to be the wildest service,
[1:04:30] but there needs to be a moving of the
[1:04:31] waters while you're in the church. You
[1:04:34] say, "I want I want I want healing."
[1:04:35] Then there needs to be a troubling of
[1:04:36] the waters so you can step into it and
[1:04:39] get healed. Listen, I know I know
[1:04:41] there's been so many people that are
[1:04:43] against emotion. Listen, I don't believe
[1:04:44] in emotions. I don't believe emotion
[1:04:46] saves a person. But I'll say this. If
[1:04:48] you got saved,
[1:04:50] you're going to show you got saved.
[1:04:53] If you got the Holy Ghost, your life is
[1:04:55] going to show that you got the Holy
[1:04:57] Ghost. I watched our young people go
[1:04:59] through. Listen, I I've sat there and I
[1:05:01] know you get the critics. They watch
[1:05:03] those they watch those youth meetings
[1:05:04] and they well so and so fell out and
[1:05:06] they fall out all the time. minute.
[1:05:07] Listen, that's I I tell you what, I I
[1:05:10] wish they all would. It don't bother me
[1:05:12] a bit. I I think we've got too many
[1:05:14] critics sitting around and not enough
[1:05:15] people trying to help the young people
[1:05:16] get the Holy Ghost. I say, Lord, take
[1:05:18] the critical spirits out of the church
[1:05:20] and let our young people get the Holy
[1:05:21] Ghost. If they slobber, if they speak in
[1:05:24] tongues, if they act like Come on,
[1:05:25] church. I say, however it happens, let
[1:05:28] it happen. Open the floodgates of heaven
[1:05:31] and let it rain. Open the open open
[1:05:33] every vessel, every channel and let our
[1:05:36] young people receive the Holy Ghost. You
[1:05:38] say, "Well, I remember what it was like
[1:05:40] when I was a teenager." Do you realize
[1:05:41] it's worse now than it was when you was
[1:05:43] a teenager?
[1:05:45] Yes, sir. Yeah. You say, "Well, I
[1:05:48] listen, Brother Brandham said, every
[1:05:49] generation has a chance at their own
[1:05:50] revival. So, don't don't be shutting
[1:05:52] down revival for our young people. If it
[1:05:55] gets loud a little out of hand, Brother
[1:05:56] Brandham said, "Amen, we need to get out
[1:05:58] of order long enough to get saved." I
[1:06:00] say, you know, you you get so critical
[1:06:03] and you get that spirit on you and the
[1:06:05] next thing you know, our young people
[1:06:07] can't receive because there's too many
[1:06:10] too many elder people sitting around
[1:06:12] saying, "Well, well, you know, I
[1:06:13] wouldn't have acted like that. Well, I
[1:06:15] don't care how you acted when you got
[1:06:16] saved. Everybody might act a little
[1:06:18] different, but I want the Holy Ghost. I
[1:06:20] don't care how it comes. I don't care
[1:06:23] how they got to act. I don't care how
[1:06:24] they got to look. I want the Holy Ghost
[1:06:26] in our young people." Amen.
[1:06:29] You say, "Well, it's just an emotion."
[1:06:30] No. No. You know, the same people that
[1:06:32] are sit there and say it's just an
[1:06:33] emotion. They need to be up there acting
[1:06:34] the same way. Come on, church. I love
[1:06:37] how Brother Brandham said he was sitting
[1:06:38] in the seat of the the scornful. Come
[1:06:40] on. And he said he was sitting there and
[1:06:42] he was criticizing these people that
[1:06:44] were dancing. Well, well, well, well.
[1:06:47] How would you feel if we had people
[1:06:48] dancing in church?
[1:06:52] Is this okay? Amen. I mean, be God
[1:06:55] already knew what you would do. So, if
[1:06:57] you're going to dance, you might as well
[1:06:58] just dance. If you listen, God already
[1:07:01] knew how you'd act when you get the Holy
[1:07:02] Ghost, right? Don't be ashamed to act
[1:07:04] how God wants you to act, right? Don't
[1:07:07] be ashamed to live how God wants you to
[1:07:09] live. But, Brother Ray was sitting in
[1:07:11] the seat of the scornful. And he was
[1:07:13] actually sitting there in his heart or
[1:07:15] maybe maybe in his mind just thinking,
[1:07:17] "Well, that that's crazy or that's
[1:07:19] fanatics or holy rollers or I wouldn't
[1:07:20] do that." He said, "The next thing you
[1:07:22] know, the spirit got on him and he was
[1:07:23] dancing with him." I think some of us
[1:07:25] need to go ahead and just dance with the
[1:07:27] young people. Shout with the young
[1:07:29] people. Come on, church. You say, "Why
[1:07:32] do you harp on this?" Because the spirit
[1:07:34] of the age is not enthusiasm. The spirit
[1:07:36] of the age is not excitement. The spirit
[1:07:38] of the age is not joy. The spirit of the
[1:07:41] age is not the Holy Ghost. No, it's a
[1:07:43] lukewarm church. And we got to fight the
[1:07:45] spirit of the age.
[1:07:47] That's right. You say, "Well, Larry,
[1:07:48] she's fighting that emotion." because
[1:07:50] that's not the spirit of the age.
[1:07:53] Come on, church. I know. I know there's
[1:07:55] emotion. I know there's things that that
[1:07:57] that's not exactly in order. I
[1:07:58] understand all those things, but I mean,
[1:08:00] can the Lord let us get out of order
[1:08:02] long enough to let our young people
[1:08:03] experience revival for one time? Amen.
[1:08:06] We need revival. I'll tell you what, the
[1:08:08] the the person that needs revival the
[1:08:10] most is the person who's telling
[1:08:11] everybody else needs revival. So, I need
[1:08:14] revival more than any of you.
[1:08:18] You know, if we ever thought like that,
[1:08:20] if we thought we needed revival more
[1:08:22] than anybody else, if we thought about
[1:08:24] ourselves in the way that I I need to
[1:08:26] get closer to God, I need to I need more
[1:08:29] I need more of the Holy Ghost. I need
[1:08:30] another baptism of the Holy Ghost. Did
[1:08:32] you know that it would get our focus off
[1:08:33] everybody else?
[1:08:35] Come on, church.
[1:08:37] You know, when you go to youth camp as
[1:08:39] as a minister and you go over there and
[1:08:40] you get to stand in that prayer line,
[1:08:42] you know, the devil will put thoughts in
[1:08:43] your mind saying, "Well, that one there,
[1:08:44] they're just they do this every year and
[1:08:46] they get blessed every year." If all it
[1:08:48] is is a blessing of God, I say, "Go
[1:08:49] ahead and send the blessing."
[1:08:52] If that's all it was was they just got
[1:08:54] blessed. Get blessed. Come on, church.
[1:08:57] Because God has sent this spirit of
[1:08:59] revival for you in your generation. And
[1:09:02] God has come to you, listen, with a
[1:09:04] message that was predestinated before
[1:09:07] the world. Before there was an earth,
[1:09:09] before before there was anything, God
[1:09:12] created all these things. And then he
[1:09:14] already knew the age you would live in.
[1:09:16] And he knew you needed revival.
[1:09:19] And so God knew that in this age, he
[1:09:22] would send revival. And he knew who
[1:09:24] would participate in revival. Amen. Can
[1:09:27] you say amen? Right? And he knew that
[1:09:29] you would fight spirits of the elders
[1:09:31] that would try to try to try to blow out
[1:09:33] the revival or try to put a damper on
[1:09:35] it. And you got to fight that spirit,
[1:09:37] too. All right.
[1:09:41] You know, we're we're all Come on,
[1:09:43] church. We don't fight one another. We
[1:09:44] love one another. But we don't want the
[1:09:46] spirit in the church. It's cold and dead
[1:09:48] and picking at one another. We don't
[1:09:49] need it. Is that okay? In here, we're
[1:09:53] family. We love one another. We may not
[1:09:55] always be the best. Listen, there
[1:09:57] there's a there there there's people in
[1:09:58] here going through things, I'm sure,
[1:09:59] that I don't know about, and I don't
[1:10:00] need to know about it. God knows about
[1:10:02] it. God knows what you're going through.
[1:10:04] God knows every mistake you made this
[1:10:06] week. I don't need to know those
[1:10:08] mistakes. But I can tell you something.
[1:10:10] God knew you'd made it before you made
[1:10:11] it. And he knew you'd be here after you
[1:10:13] made the mistake. And he made a way back
[1:10:16] for you before you ever left him in the
[1:10:18] first place. Come on, church. Before you
[1:10:21] ever fell, God was there to pick you up.
[1:10:23] Amen. And brother Brandon would say it
[1:10:26] like this. He said, "Watch carefully."
[1:10:27] He said, "Before there was ever a speck
[1:10:28] of stardust before God was God was even
[1:10:32] God." He said, "God is an object of
[1:10:33] adoration." And no, no one was there to
[1:10:35] worship him. So, he was at that time
[1:10:37] only potentially God. Think about that.
[1:10:40] Before we were here, God was only
[1:10:42] potentially God, right? Before you
[1:10:45] think, I've went too long. I'm not my
[1:10:47] time's not up yet.
[1:10:49] So, get that thought out of your mind,
[1:10:51] too. Fight those evil
[1:10:54] thoughts. Brother Brandon would say it
[1:10:56] like this. He said, "He was known only
[1:10:59] as eternal spirit. The bride was already
[1:11:01] in his mind." Yes, sir. Think about it.
[1:11:04] You young people still with me? Amen.
[1:11:06] Y'all still here? Okay. The bride was
[1:11:08] already in his mind. The bride is is is
[1:11:10] the people who will accept the message
[1:11:12] of the hour in this last day and receive
[1:11:14] the Holy Ghost. You are the bride of
[1:11:17] Jesus Christ. You are the one he has
[1:11:18] chosen to put his name in. Is this okay?
[1:11:22] You young people can say big amen.
[1:11:25] That's weak. We'll work on that. And so
[1:11:28] we'll have to have sister Anna say sing
[1:11:29] say amen so many times until all the
[1:11:31] young people can say amen. And so she
[1:11:34] was existing in his thought. So you were
[1:11:36] in the mind of God. Did you know that?
[1:11:38] Amen. You know God knew what color hair
[1:11:40] you'd have before uh before you ever had
[1:11:43] hair.
[1:11:46] And he knew where your hairs would be
[1:11:48] after you lost all of them. All right.
[1:11:50] Amen. Yeah. You know, God chose you to
[1:11:55] have the hair color you
[1:11:57] have. And so, we thank God for that. You
[1:11:59] know, everybody has It's the worst. It's
[1:12:02] the worst. It's the It's the worst thing
[1:12:04] ever. If you know, you're getting gray
[1:12:07] like me and you're like, "Lord, why
[1:12:08] couldn't you let me go until I'm like 50
[1:12:10] to get gray hair?" But then God's
[1:12:12] probably sitting there thinking, "Well,
[1:12:13] I could have give you a bald head."
[1:12:16] And then you're like, "Well, thank you,
[1:12:18] Lord, for my gray hair.
[1:12:20] They didn't turn loose yet, you know.
[1:12:21] But I mean, but you know, we Sorry,
[1:12:23] brother. Brother Wes. Brother Wes is
[1:12:26] like, "What happened?" You know,
[1:12:28] happened to me. He showed me a picture
[1:12:30] the other day. He had so much hair. You
[1:12:32] You boys, you think you think you're
[1:12:33] never going to go bald. It's funny
[1:12:36] because you're going to lose hair and
[1:12:37] you know your dad, you probably going
[1:12:40] you may have less than your
[1:12:42] dad and you show up in a toupe at 30
[1:12:45] years old. We're going to, you
[1:12:48] know, but you know, God made us the way
[1:12:51] we are. And we don't always understand
[1:12:52] the reason, right? You guys still with
[1:12:55] me? You kids still with me? Young
[1:12:58] people, not kids. That's goats. You
[1:13:00] little lambs still with
[1:13:02] me? Think about it, though. God made you
[1:13:06] to be who you
[1:13:08] are. And so, why would we want to say,
[1:13:10] "Well, I wish I was different. I wish I
[1:13:12] was this way. I wish." No, we don't wish
[1:13:14] nothing because God made us just like we
[1:13:15] are. Right?
[1:13:18] God made you to be who you are. And
[1:13:20] every trial that you're going to go
[1:13:21] through when you get older, I say this
[1:13:23] to you older, young people, middle-aged
[1:13:25] people, every trial you went through,
[1:13:26] God God knew you was going to go through
[1:13:27] that trial. And he didn't push you into
[1:13:29] that trial and then pull you out on the
[1:13:31] other end. But he let you walk into that
[1:13:33] trial all by yourself. But he knew you'd
[1:13:35] already He knew you'd come out, right?
[1:13:37] Come on, church. You know what we do? We
[1:13:39] limit the power of God too often. We
[1:13:41] make God a far off for our young people
[1:13:44] when God is not way away. God is right
[1:13:46] here. God is on the inside of you. And
[1:13:49] God has placed a desire in you to be a
[1:13:52] Christian. So I want to say, you know,
[1:13:55] on behalf of Word of Life Tabernacle, we
[1:13:56] want to nurture and water and grow these
[1:13:59] young Christians. Come on, church. We
[1:14:02] need what? We need the church of
[1:14:03] tomorrow to be on fire for God. We need
[1:14:06] our young people to to have a desire to
[1:14:08] serve God. Amen. I don't want them to
[1:14:10] have a desire for just worldly
[1:14:11] pleasures, but I want to see a desire in
[1:14:14] them to show up at the house of God and
[1:14:16] worship while they're there because this
[1:14:19] is the greatest thing or the greatest
[1:14:21] place you can have them.
[1:14:24] You could have them anywhere in the
[1:14:25] world right now. And let me tell you
[1:14:27] something that the the God could be
[1:14:29] working on their soul right now in this
[1:14:30] service. I I've stood here and preached
[1:14:33] and the most unexpected young person to
[1:14:35] be at the altar. You don't know what
[1:14:36] they're going through. You don't know
[1:14:38] how God's dealing with them and the next
[1:14:39] thing you know they're at the altar.
[1:14:41] Don't ever don't ever shy away from
[1:14:42] going to the altar. If God puts a desire
[1:14:45] for the altar, then go to the altar.
[1:14:47] We're going to take all the time we need
[1:14:49] to let our young people get through with
[1:14:50] God because nothing matters as much as
[1:14:53] my son or my daughter getting the Holy
[1:14:55] Ghost in the house of God. Nothing
[1:14:57] matters as much as our young people
[1:14:59] being on fire with the message of the
[1:15:01] hour. Nothing else matters
[1:15:04] when it comes to those things. We can do
[1:15:06] all the things we want to do and that's
[1:15:08] good. But I think what we need to do is
[1:15:10] take time for our young people and say
[1:15:13] that they they are the reason that we're
[1:15:16] here. So, brother Brandon would say,
[1:15:18] "Thoughts of God are eternal. They are
[1:15:20] real. They are not simply like a man
[1:15:21] with a blueprint he has drawn up which
[1:15:23] one day will be translated into
[1:15:24] substance and form, but they are already
[1:15:26] real and eternal and part of God." And
[1:15:28] brother Brandon would, excuse me, the
[1:15:29] scriptures would say it like this. Amen.
[1:15:31] We are troubled on every side. In 2
[1:15:33] Corinthians 4:8, we are troubled on
[1:15:35] every side yet not distressed. We are
[1:15:37] perplexed but not in despair. Persecuted
[1:15:40] but not forsaken, cast down but not
[1:15:42] destroyed. You know why? Because when
[1:15:44] you're cast down, you're not destroyed
[1:15:45] because he knew you'd be cast down but
[1:15:48] he was there to pick you up. Amen. You
[1:15:50] may be troubled on every side but you're
[1:15:52] not distressed. Amen. We are perplexed
[1:15:54] but not in despair. Why? Because we know
[1:15:57] who we are. Amen. And we are not going
[1:15:59] to give in to the devil who has tried to
[1:16:02] steal our joy and trying to steal our
[1:16:04] young people. Come on, church.
[1:16:06] What we need to do is let revival happen
[1:16:09] in our young people. Amen. And don't sit
[1:16:11] there with a cold bucket of water and
[1:16:12] try to put it out.
[1:16:15] Let's let our young people have a
[1:16:17] revival. Amen. And just like the hot
[1:16:19] dog, before you could even smell the
[1:16:23] aroma, you had a taste for a hot dog.
[1:16:29] You don't like hot dogs. Before there
[1:16:31] was ever,
[1:16:34] huh? Peanut butter and jelly hot dogs.
[1:16:36] Before there was ever a peanut butter
[1:16:37] and jelly hot
[1:16:40] dog, there was one already made for you.
[1:16:43] Not at our house. They, you know, think
[1:16:47] about it. I I know I've made this a
[1:16:48] little bit simple and and try to keep it
[1:16:51] light, but you know, think about it. If
[1:16:54] you want
[1:16:55] God, it's as simple as God's already
[1:16:58] chose you. Right? Amen. I've heard a
[1:17:02] story and I I don't know where I heard
[1:17:03] it, so I hope it wasn't anybody here
[1:17:05] that told me and told me not to tell it
[1:17:08] because I probably forgot not to tell
[1:17:09] it. But I heard a story that there was a
[1:17:11] young man went to youth camp and he was
[1:17:13] going to get
[1:17:14] baptized and and the parents wouldn't
[1:17:18] let him or something and then the next
[1:17:20] thing you know he goes home and he never
[1:17:22] has a desire to be baptized
[1:17:25] again. And I got to thinking that's
[1:17:28] that's a that's parent delinquence.
[1:17:31] Amen. That's that's a problem with a
[1:17:33] parent. If your children if your
[1:17:34] children want to be baptized, let's get
[1:17:35] them baptized.
[1:17:37] Say, well, I want them to just wait.
[1:17:38] Well, what are they waiting for? Go
[1:17:40] ahead and let them do it while the
[1:17:41] desire is there. You say, "Well, they're
[1:17:42] too young." Come on, church. You can
[1:17:44] always be rebaptized, but if that's if
[1:17:46] that's the only time they have to make
[1:17:48] that decision, let them make that
[1:17:49] decision because that may be the that
[1:17:51] may be the time that God's dealing with
[1:17:53] them. Well, come on, church. We've
[1:17:54] limited God. You got to be this old or
[1:17:56] you got to be this age. You got to you
[1:17:57] got to do this. You got to do Come on,
[1:17:59] church. What we need to do is take the
[1:18:01] limits off of God and then we'll see
[1:18:03] results in our church. we'll see results
[1:18:06] in our young people. And so what I would
[1:18:08] say this evening, if you young people
[1:18:10] have any desire to serve God, hold on to
[1:18:13] that desire and serve God with
[1:18:16] everything you've got. Don't let nothing
[1:18:18] get in front of God. Don't let Don't let
[1:18:21] nothing stop you from worshiping God in
[1:18:23] the house of God. Can you say amen?
[1:18:25] Don't let nothing Listen, church,
[1:18:27] there's a lot of distractions, right?
[1:18:30] But we don't need to look at the
[1:18:31] distractions. We need to look at the
[1:18:33] desire, right? Amen. And you can you
[1:18:35] could say, "Well, this person worships
[1:18:36] different. This one acts." I don't care
[1:18:37] how that happens. What I want to tell
[1:18:38] you is this. Just wait until God moves
[1:18:41] on you. You might be that funny acting
[1:18:43] person in church.
[1:18:47] And if you are, don't be ashamed of it.
[1:18:50] Because the apostle would say, I believe
[1:18:52] it was Paul that said, "In the way
[1:18:54] that's called heresy, that's the way I
[1:18:55] worship God.
[1:18:57] The way that's called crazy, that's how
[1:18:59] I wor listen church, that's how we're
[1:19:01] supposed to worship God. So, I want to
[1:19:04] say tonight in
[1:19:05] closing, we are, you may be troubled.
[1:19:07] You may have all kinds of problems, but
[1:19:10] we're not distressed. We're not in
[1:19:11] despair. And we are not forsaken.
[1:19:15] Can you say amen? Young people, you are
[1:19:18] not forsaken.
[1:19:20] God chose you. He placed you here. He
[1:19:22] knows who you are. He knows every one of
[1:19:24] you. He knows your first, middle, and
[1:19:25] last name. I don't even know all that.
[1:19:27] Amen. Yeah. I I know a lot of your first
[1:19:30] names, not all of those because I
[1:19:33] forget. When I call my children, I say,
[1:19:35] "Jason,
[1:19:37] Wyatt, Tory, Jonah," or something like
[1:19:39] that, and then got to remember which one
[1:19:41] I'm actually talking to. But you know,
[1:19:43] God doesn't do that, right? Because he
[1:19:46] wrote your name on the palm of his hand
[1:19:48] and he knows every detail of your life.
[1:19:52] Do you believe that? You young people
[1:19:54] believe that? I want us to stand
[1:19:55] together as musicians
[1:19:57] come. I know you know just I don't know
[1:20:01] how much you got out of
[1:20:03] today but the point is this before you
[1:20:05] were born before your parents thought
[1:20:07] about
[1:20:08] you before before anything in your
[1:20:16] life before anything ever
[1:20:19] happened. God knew you. You know that
[1:20:24] before your parents were born, before
[1:20:26] your grandparents was born, before there
[1:20:29] was ever a thought of
[1:20:32] you, you believe that tonight?
[1:20:36] God knew you before your parents thought
[1:20:38] of you. And I, you know, I I I thought
[1:20:39] of I that was my thought that came to
[1:20:41] me. I thought, you
[1:20:45] know, some some some people don't even
[1:20:48] know, and I know my my my family,
[1:20:50] there's been some adoption. My mother,
[1:20:52] my wife, she's not my mother. My wife,
[1:20:54] she was
[1:20:55] adopted. And she's open about that. It's
[1:20:57] nothing hidden. She was adopted. She was
[1:20:59] adopted at a baby. And for years, she
[1:21:01] didn't know who her biological parents
[1:21:03] were. And they didn't raise her. Her her
[1:21:05] parents that we know now raised her and
[1:21:07] raised her well and and all those
[1:21:09] things. And they that's her parents. But
[1:21:11] you she didn't never there was a
[1:21:12] question in her mind, who is my
[1:21:15] parents? But you know, all that time she
[1:21:17] didn't even know who her parents
[1:21:19] were. Yet God knew who her parents were,
[1:21:23] who she
[1:21:25] was. And I want to say this just for her
[1:21:29] for her for your
[1:21:31] benefit. When her mother her birth
[1:21:33] mother was in the
[1:21:34] hospital, she wanted to uh her her birth
[1:21:38] dad wanted an abortion. They wanted an
[1:21:41] abortion. And her birth mother was
[1:21:43] Catholic. And one of the Catholics that
[1:21:45] don't, they don't believe in abortion. I
[1:21:47] want you to notice that every step in
[1:21:49] her life made it to where she could be
[1:21:52] where she is today.
[1:21:54] Had her mother believed in abortion, she
[1:21:57] wouldn't be here.
[1:21:59] It's just as good as that. Think about
[1:22:00] it. God knew every step and he knew how
[1:22:03] to get you here safely.
[1:22:06] When when the disciples were in the
[1:22:07] boat, they didn't know about the storm
[1:22:10] coming, but God already knew about the
[1:22:11] storm. And God already had somebody in
[1:22:14] the boat to calm the storm. I wish you'd
[1:22:16] hear me tonight. God knew you before you
[1:22:19] were even born. Before you were in your
[1:22:21] mother's womb. God knew
[1:22:24] you. Before anything could happen in
[1:22:26] your life, God knows what's going to
[1:22:28] happen. So don't worry about tomorrow.
[1:22:30] Don't worry about the future. God
[1:22:31] already knows every step. He knows the
[1:22:34] day you you're born and he knows the day
[1:22:36] that you will die. He knows everything
[1:22:38] in between. He knows the why, the how,
[1:22:42] the reason. You like, you know, we
[1:22:44] question God. Well, God knows. And if
[1:22:47] you need to know, you'll know, right?
[1:22:49] But God
[1:22:51] knows. We need to surrender ourselves to
[1:22:53] God. Because if he's an all- knowing
[1:22:57] God, then I wonder if we could just
[1:22:59] submit ourselves and say, you know what?
[1:23:01] I have a desire to serve God, but I want
[1:23:03] to give my life to him. And young
[1:23:06] people, there's nothing you can do
[1:23:08] better than giving your life to Jesus
[1:23:10] Christ.
[1:23:12] Who you marry is not as important as
[1:23:14] being a Christian.
[1:23:17] Who your friends are is not as important
[1:23:19] as being a Christian, right? Your
[1:23:22] favorite movie
[1:23:23] is not as important as time with the
[1:23:26] Lord reading your Bible. you know that
[1:23:29] you know we we we we want our kids you
[1:23:32] know I want to be I want to raise the
[1:23:34] next Payton Manning you know not really
[1:23:37] but you think of in parents you know you
[1:23:38] think you want to be proud of them you
[1:23:39] want to be proud of their job I'll tell
[1:23:41] you what be make would make me more
[1:23:42] proud than anything for our young people
[1:23:44] to see young people on fire for
[1:23:47] God not their not their job
[1:23:50] status I know all these things are good
[1:23:52] but that's not what I'm concerned about
[1:23:54] as a minister of the gospel I want to
[1:23:55] see souls saved and young people on fire
[1:23:58] for God. And I know our other ministers
[1:23:59] are the same way. It it it's not about,
[1:24:01] listen, church, we're not trying to
[1:24:03] raise movie stars. We're not trying to
[1:24:05] raise the next great athletes. What
[1:24:07] we're trying to raise is is young people
[1:24:09] who will get ready for a rapture. And us
[1:24:12] older people need to say, "Yes, I'll get
[1:24:14] behind that." Because they may be the
[1:24:16] ones to see the coming of the Lord. And
[1:24:19] and we listen church, we we need to be
[1:24:21] so in love with each other and so on
[1:24:24] fire for God that our young people can
[1:24:26] see that and can have that as an example
[1:24:29] for the next generation. There's been
[1:24:30] enough fussing and fighting in the
[1:24:32] message. Lay it aside.
[1:24:35] Can you say amen? There's been enough
[1:24:37] of, well, we used to do it this way or
[1:24:38] we used to do it that way. Lay it aside.
[1:24:41] There's been enough of, well, I wish the
[1:24:43] church would do this. Listen, listen. I
[1:24:45] I I know that critical spirits come in.
[1:24:47] But those critical spirits, all they do
[1:24:49] is affect our services. Lay it aside for
[1:24:53] the sake of our young people. Lay aside
[1:24:56] everything and let us pray for our young
[1:24:58] people and let our young people pray and
[1:25:00] say, "Lord, I just want I have a desire
[1:25:03] to please you." And if we have a desire,
[1:25:06] God already spoke to us. God's already
[1:25:08] Listen, I I've seen these young people
[1:25:10] up here at the altar. I I've some of
[1:25:12] them have been baptized. I baptized one
[1:25:14] of myself. I'm going to tell you
[1:25:15] something. The Lord has already been
[1:25:17] moving in them. Don't let the devil
[1:25:19] distract you. Don't let the devil try to
[1:25:22] try to say, "Well, God, look at this
[1:25:24] youth group or wish we could do what
[1:25:25] they're doing." No. No. Let's focus on
[1:25:28] what we have here. You know, where
[1:25:29] revival is not growing your church, but
[1:25:32] revival is reviving what you have,
[1:25:34] right?
[1:25:36] I believe we've got great young people
[1:25:38] here in this church, but let us be in a
[1:25:40] constant revival that our young people
[1:25:42] could be in revival and our old people
[1:25:44] could be in revival. Come on, church.
[1:25:46] Let us be in a constant revival so that
[1:25:49] our young people can say, "Well, well, I
[1:25:51] got to be quiet like they are quiet."
[1:25:53] No, I say if God, listen, church, if God
[1:25:55] moves on you to shout, I say, "Let's
[1:25:58] have the liberty to shout." If God moves
[1:26:00] on you to say amen, let us have the
[1:26:02] liberty to say, "Amen.
[1:26:06] If God moves on us, we need to be open.
[1:26:08] We need to be willing. We need to be we
[1:26:11] need to be just in his service. However
[1:26:13] he moves me, let me move. However he
[1:26:16] wants me to respond, I will respond. If
[1:26:18] it's at an altar, I'll go to the altar.
[1:26:20] If I need to stand there and let a
[1:26:22] minister lay his hands on me to pray for
[1:26:23] the sick, I I'm willing. Listen church,
[1:26:26] lay aside your own thinking and let us
[1:26:28] be surrendered vessels to a God that has
[1:26:31] already chosen us. Before there was ever
[1:26:35] a world, you were in the thoughts of
[1:26:37] God. You're eternal. You're eternal. And
[1:26:40] I I I just want to see our young people
[1:26:42] on fire. How about you? How about you? I
[1:26:45] wonder if we could just
[1:26:46] say, bow our heads and just say it like
[1:26:49] this.
[1:26:50] Lord, Lord, I'm willing to surrender my
[1:26:53] time for our young people to be
[1:26:55] saved. I I'm willing to surrender what I
[1:26:57] had planned for our young people to get
[1:27:00] the Holy Ghost. Are Are we Are we really
[1:27:03] Are we really ready and able to say,
[1:27:04] "Lord, whatever you have for my young
[1:27:06] people, for these young people, their
[1:27:08] parents are sitting there." Every parent
[1:27:10] in this building ought to be saying,
[1:27:11] "Lord, fill my young people with the
[1:27:13] Holy Ghost. Above everything else, I
[1:27:15] want to see revival in our young people.
[1:27:17] Above everything else, I want to see God
[1:27:19] moving in their lives. Above
[1:27:22] everything, I want to see young people
[1:27:25] filled and serving God and be that next
[1:27:28] generation we can look at and say that,
[1:27:30] you know, it it was good to pass the
[1:27:32] torch to you. Amen. There's going to be
[1:27:34] the young preachers that are raised up.
[1:27:36] We don't want to just raise up more more
[1:27:37] preachers, but we want to raise up young
[1:27:39] people who love this message.
[1:27:42] We want to raise up young ladies who we
[1:27:44] don't have to force them to dress a
[1:27:45] certain way, but they're so in love with
[1:27:47] God that it just comes natural to
[1:27:50] them. That's what we want. As we h as we
[1:27:54] bow our heads, I want you to search your
[1:27:55] heart right now. If the Lord is dealing
[1:27:57] with you or if you need prayer, I want
[1:27:59] you to know the altar's open and we'll
[1:28:01] be happy to pray for
[1:28:06] you. Oh, so unworthy now. Oh,
[1:28:11] so
[1:28:13] [Music]
[1:28:16] unworthy. Oh, love such mercy.

[1:30:04] hands any of the ministers or brothers
[1:30:07] would come and pray. Sister would pray.
[1:30:11] Oh, with all your heart you love
[1:30:14] me.

[1:30:30] cross for you and
[1:30:33] I were all Oh, can you sing it one more
[1:30:37] time? You believe he knew you?

[1:30:46] me. Oh yes, he
[1:30:50] loved
[1:30:54] me. Oh, it was he whose glory
[1:31:01] remains. All the heavens
[1:31:07] shine. Oh, I was so I was
[1:31:11] [Music]
[1:31:16] unworthy. Such
[1:31:19] [Music]
[1:31:22] worthy. Oh, when he
[1:31:29] [Music]
[1:31:30] was
[1:31:32] I was
[1:31:35] born. He's
[1:31:38] all I
[1:31:41] need. He's
[1:31:44] all I
[1:31:47] need. Oh,

[1:42:38] tell of his
[1:42:40] love. Oh, we'll give all the

[1:42:57] wonderful

[1:44:15] Jesus and
[1:44:18] tell of his
[1:44:21] wonderful
[1:44:23] love. Can you give the Lord a hand clap
[1:44:25] of praise
[1:44:26] tonight? Aren't you thankful that he
[1:44:29] that began a good work will finish what
[1:44:32] he started? Can you say amen? If he
[1:44:35] started a good work today, he will
[1:44:37] finish a good work. And he knows what's
[1:44:39] on the way. Somebody ought to give the
[1:44:40] Lord praise tonight. Somebody ought to
[1:44:43] say, "Praise the Lord." Because if he
[1:44:45] started a work, I don't care how small
[1:44:47] that work is in your life tonight. Don't
[1:44:50] you get to thinking, "Well, that's all I
[1:44:51] get." No. God wants to give you filling
[1:44:54] after filling after filling. Young
[1:44:56] people, old people, I don't care who you
[1:44:58] are. God wants to give you more than you
[1:45:00] want. He wants you to be Come on,
[1:45:02] church. He wants to fill you more than
[1:45:05] you want to be filled. So I say, "Lord,
[1:45:07] fill my cup. Fill me over and over and
[1:45:09] over until I can't contain the blessings
[1:45:12] of God." Amen. Do you love the Lord
[1:45:14] tonight? Amen. I wonder if we could sing
[1:45:16] the old song, My God is real. Kim G, you
[1:45:19] believe he's real? Believe he's real.
[1:45:24] With all your hearts now, let me hear
[1:45:26] you sing it now.
[1:45:28] There are some
[1:45:32] things I may not
[1:45:36] know. There are some
[1:45:40] places I just can't
[1:45:44] go. But I am
[1:45:49] sure of this one
[1:45:53] day that God is real. For I can feel him
[1:45:59] deep within. Let me hear you now. Oh my
[1:46:03] God is
[1:46:05] real. He's real in my
[1:46:08] [Music]
[1:46:09] soul. My God is real. For he has washed.
[1:46:15] Oh, can you testify about it now? Well,
[1:46:18] his love for
[1:46:21] me is like your gold.
[1:46:26] My God is
[1:46:29] real in my
[1:46:33] soul. Some folks may doubt, some
[1:46:37] boast, some folks may
[1:46:40] scorn. Well, they can all go
[1:46:43] on and leave me
[1:46:48] alone. But as for me, this is your part
[1:46:52] here. I'll take God's
[1:46:55] [Music]
[1:46:56] part. And God is real. For I can't feel
[1:47:01] him deep in my
[1:47:03] heart. Oh, my God is
[1:47:08] real. He's real in my soul. Oh yes, he
[1:47:12] is. My God is real. For he has washed
[1:47:17] and made me whole.
[1:47:20] Oh, his love for
[1:47:22] [Music]
[1:47:23] me is like your

[1:51:31] little, little by little, God's going to
[1:51:35] get he's going to finish what he
[1:51:36] started. We believe that tonight. And
