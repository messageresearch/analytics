[23:30] looking at that slideshow there you see
[23:33] someone who lived a good life
[23:36] and then you saw how she got to where
[23:38] she couldn't live like she wanted to
[23:41] but where she's at today
[23:43] she's perfectly healthy and happy
[23:46] there's no more worries no more cares
[23:48] and I believe if she could look down
[23:51] today and see those friends and loved
[23:52] ones that turned out to celebrate her
[23:54] life I believe she'd be pleased with
[23:55] this today
[23:56] the family had asked me to sing this
[23:58] song so if you'd help me sing it I
[24:00] believe she would like that

[29:46] you may be seated this afternoon
[29:50] Mr Allison comes to sing her song I
[29:53] didn't get to know Sister Gene as a
[29:56] young person
[29:57] and to see her walk and you know live
[30:00] her life
[30:01] but being able to stand here sometimes
[30:03] and sing to her and to preach to her and
[30:07] after service going out she grabbed your
[30:08] hand and if she held on to it I think
[30:10] that meant she liked it
[30:12] and uh maybe if she didn't she didn't
[30:14] like it but she couldn't tell you the
[30:16] bad things but you know it always seemed
[30:18] like she was happy to be here she
[30:20] enjoyed going to church and so my wife
[30:24] had the privilege of helping her out a
[30:26] little bit there at the house and uh one
[30:29] day sister Gene as we known her here
[30:32] made a cake and I think she made it for
[30:35] some friends
[30:36] and uh my wife was over there helping
[30:39] her out and she sent the cake home with
[30:40] my wife and for us to eat because she
[30:43] said that she didn't want Robert coming
[30:45] home knowing she was up baking
[30:47] and I didn't want to get in trouble by
[30:49] Robert
[30:50] you couldn't keep her down
[30:52] she always wanted to be up and doing
[30:54] things and now she can
[30:57] without any limitations are we thankful
[31:00] for that that we have a promise that
[31:02] we'll get to see her again

[37:28] me
[37:41] what a privilege it's been over the last
[37:43] couple of years to be sister Jean's
[37:45] pastor and
[37:47] I
[37:49] people touch your lives in different
[37:51] ways and sister Gene touched Mine by
[37:54] just being here and wanting to be here
[37:57] and it was very difficult for her in her
[38:00] situation in her body but she wanted to
[38:03] serve the Lord and and she did and we're
[38:07] grateful for that I'm grateful for the
[38:09] example that she set and for the times
[38:11] we got to spend together in her home she
[38:12] was always a Believer she believed the
[38:14] Lord was going to heal her and he has so
[38:17] we believe he has today One Way Or
[38:20] Another We're a winner either way and so
[38:22] we're grateful for that thank you for
[38:24] coming today I want to read to you out
[38:26] of John chapter 14 and down verses one
[38:29] through three and just kind of talk
[38:32] about sister Gene and and the word and
[38:35] some of the things these are things that
[38:37] we believe as I said this morning we
[38:39] believe that the Bible is the foundation
[38:41] for all of our Doctrine all of our
[38:44] practice and we believe that the Bible
[38:47] teaches that we're going to see our
[38:49] sister again in and so we don't sorrow
[38:51] like as others who have no hope but we
[38:54] believe that we'll see her and what what
[38:56] a promise that that is let's look at
[38:57] John 14 and 1 let not your heart be
[39:01] troubled you believe in God believe also
[39:03] in me in my father's house or many
[39:06] mansions if it were not so I would have
[39:08] told you I go to prepare a place
[39:12] for you
[39:13] and if I go and prepare a place for you
[39:16] I will come again and receive you unto
[39:19] myself that where I am
[39:22] there you may be
[39:24] also
[39:26] I didn't
[39:28] know Sister Gene as a young woman I met
[39:31] her her body had already been broken by
[39:34] that awful disease of Parkinson's
[39:37] but I know that she always wanted her
[39:39] home to be nice
[39:41] in fact brother Robert told me a story
[39:43] about how that when she was younger and
[39:46] the kids when they were children said
[39:48] they would come in out of the house and
[39:50] the kids always had to take their shoes
[39:51] off before they come in the house and if
[39:53] she didn't she'd come after him with a
[39:55] broom
[39:56] and that's the kind of woman that she
[39:58] was I always knew that my sister-in-law
[40:00] told me she said I've never cleaned the
[40:02] house like that said that's the cleanest
[40:04] house that I've ever cleaned and and
[40:06] because she would still try to be up and
[40:08] doing and sneaking around like brother
[40:10] Joel told the story of her baking the
[40:12] cake that's the way that she was she
[40:14] wanted to be up and doing and and she
[40:17] wanted her home to be nice and but there
[40:19] wasn't anything she could do about her
[40:21] body
[40:22] Satan did that it's just the world that
[40:25] we live in in this broken world but she
[40:27] wanted to be well she wanted to have be
[40:30] able to do the things she wanted to work
[40:31] in the kitchen and and be a part and
[40:34] help and she wanted her home to be more
[40:36] than just a place she lived she wanted a
[40:39] home
[40:39] and I think she fulfilled the scripture
[40:41] of Titus 2 when it speaks of of a woman
[40:44] and and what the ideal is and what a
[40:47] mother should be a homemaker says the
[40:50] aged women likewise that they be in
[40:52] behaviors becometh Holiness not false
[40:54] accusers not given to much wine teachers
[40:57] of good things teaching the young women
[40:59] to be sober and to love their husbands
[41:01] and to love their children to be
[41:03] discreet chaste keepers at home and what
[41:07] that means keepers at home it means a
[41:09] homemaker a homemaker the world that we
[41:13] live in today has made that some kind of
[41:15] a of a a bad word almost and and I know
[41:19] that my wife sometimes has told people
[41:21] I'm a homemaker and and people kind of
[41:23] look down on that I believe sister Jean
[41:25] was almost always in her life a
[41:27] homemaker I think that's a wonderful
[41:29] thing what a great job that she had as a
[41:33] homemaker a keeper at a home and I think
[41:36] there's something about a woman who
[41:38] believes the Bible like sister Jean did
[41:40] that she wanted to have a home and she
[41:42] wanted to be a homemaker I believe that
[41:46] she fulfilled also of the scripture of a
[41:49] virtuous woman I won't take the time to
[41:51] read it all this afternoon but in
[41:53] Proverbs 31 27 it said she looketh well
[41:57] to the ways of her household that's a
[42:00] good definition of a homemaker she
[42:02] looketh well to the ways of her
[42:04] household eateth not the bread of
[42:06] idleness her children to rise up and
[42:09] call her blessed and her husband also
[42:11] when he prayseth her many daughters have
[42:14] done virtuously but thou excellus them
[42:17] all favor is deceitful and beauty is
[42:20] vain if you watch the pictures you knew
[42:22] the sister Jean was a beautiful woman as
[42:25] a young lady and as she got older her
[42:28] beauty remained but her body began to
[42:30] get old and show her age but but favor
[42:33] is deceitful beauty is vain but a woman
[42:36] that fears the Lord shall be praised and
[42:39] I believe she was the woman that feared
[42:41] the Lord give her the fruit of her hands
[42:43] let her own works praise her in the
[42:46] gates she's a homemaker
[42:49] Jesus spoke in the scripture that we
[42:51] read in John 14 2 he said in my father's
[42:54] house are many mansions
[42:57] if it were not so I would have told you
[42:59] I'd go to prepare a place
[43:03] for you as much
[43:04] as sister Gene wanted the place to be
[43:07] nice that she lived in
[43:09] well Robert I believe that the Lord
[43:11] Jesus wanted a nice place
[43:13] for her to live
[43:15] not just a house but a body
[43:19] a place that she could live in something
[43:22] that she could have hands that would
[43:24] work and feet that would work I believe
[43:26] she has that today
[43:28] now
[43:30] that word house is not just a it's not a
[43:33] big house with many smaller houses
[43:35] within it it's actually household and
[43:38] it's not brick and mortar but it speaks
[43:41] of the family and mansions are Dwelling
[43:45] Places we could read it like this and my
[43:47] father's household there are many
[43:50] Dwelling Places or many kinds of
[43:53] Dwelling Places
[43:55] I don't believe that when we get to
[43:57] heaven that everybody will look just
[43:58] exactly alike I don't believe that we'll
[44:01] all be blondes or brunettes or little or
[44:04] big or all Giants even though some of us
[44:07] might wish for that
[44:09] and some of us might wish to be smaller
[44:12] but there's many kinds of Dwelling
[44:14] Places many many different kinds of
[44:18] bodies
[44:19] and God is a god of variety you can see
[44:22] that in the world that we live in he's
[44:24] got big mountains and little mountains
[44:25] he's got Plains he's got deserts he's
[44:28] got different things because he made it
[44:30] the way he wanted it he made season
[44:33] summer winter spring and Autumn although
[44:37] it seems like summer just Blends into
[44:39] the next summer anymore around here but
[44:42] yet he made the seasons he made a
[44:43] variety of of people he made some that
[44:46] are real blusterous some are dogmatic
[44:48] others are are fine some are kind
[44:51] and you just find all kinds of different
[44:54] people
[44:55] in his kingdom
[44:57] and this life then is only a preview of
[45:00] one to come
[45:02] and you look at someone in a hospital or
[45:05] on a sick bed or as I would go to Sister
[45:07] Jean's house and or she would come here
[45:09] to the church and see the condition that
[45:11] she was in and you see that but yet
[45:14] there's a there's a desire there to live
[45:16] they want to live they want to be well
[45:19] and all of us have that
[45:22] but what it tells you is there's
[45:23] somewhere where we can be well
[45:26] there's somewhere where we can live and
[45:28] I think about that he said I go to
[45:30] prepare a place for you and I've often
[45:32] wondered about that because how does he
[45:34] know but he knows me better than I know
[45:36] myself
[45:37] and so he knows what kind of a house
[45:40] that I want to live in what kind of a
[45:42] world that I would want to live in and
[45:44] he makes it just for me so that when I
[45:47] get there it'll be perfect and the world
[45:51] that she's in now she wouldn't trade
[45:53] this for that at all but the world that
[45:57] she's in now is so much better than the
[46:00] one that she left
[46:01] it's so much better than the one that
[46:04] we're left in
[46:06] When You See It someone's struggling
[46:08] like that it speaks that there's a
[46:10] better place there's a place where there
[46:12] is no struggle there's a place where
[46:14] there is no Parkinson's disease there's
[46:17] a place aren't you glad for that today
[46:19] there's a place where there are no there
[46:21] are no diseases and there are no there
[46:24] are no politics and there are no there
[46:27] are no economic struggles there's a
[46:30] place that he has prepared for you
[46:34] prepared that place for sister Gene
[46:37] at the graveside
[46:40] when we laid her away we we read this
[46:42] scripture in second Corinthians chapter
[46:44] 5.
[46:45] Paul says for we know
[46:49] how do we know because we're believers
[46:51] we know that if our Earthly house
[46:55] that he calls this body a house of this
[46:58] Tabernacle were dissolved we have
[47:02] not we will have but we have a building
[47:07] of God
[47:08] a house not made with hands
[47:11] eternal
[47:12] in the heavens
[47:14] we used to think that when we left here
[47:16] we just went to a place where our
[47:18] Spirits floated like clouds and we
[47:21] couldn't shake one another's hands but
[47:22] brother Branham taught us that we have a
[47:25] building of God and he went beyond the
[47:27] curtain of time and had the vision and
[47:29] saw the people that were there they were
[47:31] real people with real bodies not just a
[47:35] holding place somewhere but somewhere
[47:37] that's perfect
[47:38] and it's beyond perfect not Sublime is
[47:42] the way he described it but beyond
[47:43] Sublime you can't think of any words in
[47:46] the vocabulary to say it you've just
[47:49] arrived
[47:51] her house is already finished
[47:55] and I believe it's clean
[47:58] she will never have to toil to do that
[48:00] again
[48:02] you see God had a picture he had a
[48:04] picture of you
[48:06] perfect picture of sister Gene in a
[48:09] perfect condition what he wanted her to
[48:11] be and maybe some of you can remember
[48:13] you've been around a while in in her
[48:16] life and in her family you can remember
[48:18] what she was like as a young lady we
[48:20] could look at the pictures and see what
[48:22] she was but he had a picture of what he
[48:25] wanted her to be and he put that in his
[48:28] family album if we could say it that way
[48:30] he put it away and he had that in his
[48:33] mind whatever God had in his mind is
[48:36] going to happen he tells us he said I
[48:38] know the thoughts that I have towards
[48:40] you thoughts of peace and not of evil to
[48:42] bring an unexpected end so he had that
[48:45] in his mind and being the all-powerful
[48:47] omniscience omniscient providential God
[48:50] that he is he he prepared away he said I
[48:54] go to prepare a place for you so that
[48:56] you can be in that body you can be in
[48:58] that condition and so she already had
[49:01] that image of what God wanted her to be
[49:03] that body was waiting for her the moment
[49:07] that she took her last breath
[49:10] and we might wonder
[49:12] I know brother Roberts wondered
[49:14] we've talked about it why did she have
[49:16] to suffer while she was here
[49:18] well she was preparing her character for
[49:21] that house
[49:23] somehow God just knew that the trials
[49:25] and the tests and the things of life
[49:27] would prepare her for that place
[49:31] in Romans 8 15 it says you have not
[49:33] received the spirit of bondage to fear
[49:36] but have received the spirit of adoption
[49:38] whereby we cry Abba Father the spirit
[49:42] itself beareth witness with our spirit
[49:44] that we are the children of God
[49:47] and if children than heirs Heirs of God
[49:50] and Joint heirs with Christ if so be
[49:52] that we suffer with them that we may be
[49:55] also glorified together
[49:58] for I reckon that the sufferings of this
[50:01] present time
[50:03] are not worthy to be compared with the
[50:05] glory which shall be revealed in us for
[50:09] the earnest expectation of the creature
[50:11] waited for the manifestation of the sons
[50:14] of God
[50:16] for the creature was made subject to
[50:18] vanity not willingly but by reason of
[50:21] him who hath subjected the same in hopes
[50:24] in other words we didn't put ourselves
[50:26] in our bodies we didn't pick Our Lives
[50:29] she didn't pick having to suffer and
[50:32] having to go through some of the things
[50:33] that she went through in her life she
[50:35] didn't choose that
[50:37] but God allowed her to go through that
[50:39] and he did it because he wanted to
[50:42] reveal himself in her and I think we
[50:45] caught a glimpse of Heaven in the life
[50:47] of sister Gene and now she finally gets
[50:49] to grab a hold of the reality of that
[50:51] and to live
[50:53] to live
[50:56] I I can't imagine the joy that she's
[51:00] going through right now what what she
[51:02] what she is putting up with right now is
[51:05] all joy not about the bondage of a body
[51:09] that won't work right
[51:11] now look he said the creature was made
[51:14] subject to vanity because the creature
[51:16] verse 21 also shall be delivered from
[51:19] the bondage of corruption into the
[51:21] Glorious Liberty of the children of God
[51:24] we know that the whole creation groaneth
[51:27] and travaileth in pain together until
[51:29] now and not only they but ourselves also
[51:32] which have the first fruits of the
[51:34] spirit even we ourselves grown within
[51:37] ourselves waiting for the adoption to
[51:40] wit the Redemption of our body I want to
[51:43] be in my new home how many of you could
[51:45] agree with me today that's where we want
[51:47] to be we are here waiting on our change
[51:51] she's had she has hers
[51:54] I want to leave you with these words
[51:56] these Paul says behold I show you a
[51:58] mystery we shall not all sleep but we
[52:00] shall all be changed in a moment in the
[52:03] twinkling of an eye at the last Trump
[52:05] for the trumpet shall sound and the dead
[52:08] shall be raised Incorruptible and we
[52:11] shall be changed
[52:13] first Thessalonians 4 15 it goes on to
[52:16] say for this we say unto you by the word
[52:19] of the Lord that we which are alive and
[52:21] remain unto the coming of the Lord shall
[52:23] not prevent let's hinder them which are
[52:26] asleep
[52:27] for the Lord himself showed the sin from
[52:30] heaven with a shout with the voice of
[52:32] the Archangel with the Trump of God and
[52:34] the dead in Christ shall rise
[52:37] first
[52:39] then we which are alive and remain shall
[52:41] be caught up together with them in the
[52:42] clouds to meet the Lord in the air and
[52:45] so shall we ever be with the Lord he
[52:47] said wherefore Comfort one another with
[52:51] these words
[52:54] I don't think I could put it any better
[52:56] than what the scripture does
[52:59] brother Robert while we were going
[53:01] through the the process of
[53:03] of sister Gene as she began to begin to
[53:05] look like she was about to pass away I
[53:08] he sent me this quote and someone had
[53:11] sent it to him and he asked me to read
[53:12] it and I think it fits so well right
[53:14] here
[53:16] brother Brandon said so it brings Joy to
[53:18] the heart of the waiter
[53:20] that's waiting on the coming of the Lord
[53:23] and the Blessed hour that when these Old
[53:27] Vile bodies shall be changed and made
[53:29] like unto his own glorious body and we
[53:33] shall see him
[53:34] no more struggle no more sorrow no more
[53:39] old age no more infinite days when I
[53:42] read that brother Robert I thought well
[53:43] maybe maybe brother Branham put that
[53:46] wrong he he might not have understood or
[53:49] he might have meant to say something
[53:50] else but actually when you're sick when
[53:54] you're in trouble when you you just as
[53:56] you get older the days get longer and
[53:58] longer don't they he said there'd be no
[54:00] more infinite days
[54:02] no more days that never end no more
[54:04] hunger no more worry no more sickness no
[54:08] more death
[54:10] oh we just can't fathom it I'm telling
[54:13] you friend it's hard because we're human
[54:16] and death is such a thing that will all
[54:18] hate to face it
[54:20] but it's a blessed relief it's a blessed
[54:23] thing to know he'll come someday and
[54:26] these things will
[54:29] be changed
[54:33] I my mother is still living I can't
[54:35] imagine what it's like with Robert to
[54:37] lose a mother
[54:39] but I know she's in a better place that
[54:41] doesn't change how much you'll miss her
[54:43] doesn't change the whole that will be
[54:45] left in the home and and the
[54:47] companionship that was there that's not
[54:49] anymore but it's just a little while
[54:52] just a little while
[54:54] life the Bible tells us is like a vapor
[54:56] it appears for a while and it's gone
[54:58] some of you that are older know that
[55:00] that's true you you've lived and you
[55:02] look back and say where did the years go
[55:04] we only have a little time
[55:07] if we could give any advice today
[55:10] on what to do with that time first of
[55:12] all give your heart to Christ live for
[55:15] him
[55:16] believe his word love one another use
[55:19] the time wisely if you knew this was
[55:21] going to be your last day what would you
[55:23] do with it I know Sister Gene used some
[55:26] of her last days to come to church
[55:28] and to try
[55:30] to reach out for healing which she
[55:33] received
[55:34] she was ready for her new home
[55:37] and that's all that one could be asked
[55:40] she was ready because of the grace of
[55:43] the Lord Jesus Christ in her life
[55:45] if you're not ready today he is the way
[55:47] he goes on to say I am the way the truth
[55:50] and the life
[55:53] ask him to make his home in you
[55:56] we bow our heads together
[56:02] we can't honor the life of someone like
[56:04] sister Jean in an hour or two hours or
[56:07] five
[56:10] but we're trying to do our best to
[56:14] present to you that we believe she's in
[56:16] a better place
[56:18] and if you have never accepted Christ as
[56:20] your savior
[56:21] you could do that today
[56:24] and we pray that there will be comfort
[56:26] for the family
[56:28] and strength that you'll be able to make
[56:30] it through until we see her again
[56:32] Heavenly Father
[56:34] Lord I Thank you for these that have
[56:36] come and
[56:37] they they wanted to be here to honor
[56:41] sister Gene
[56:43] Lord they were there for her in some way
[56:45] through her life and we're thankful for
[56:47] that
[56:47] [Music]
[56:49] but God I pray that you'd help them to
[56:51] know that they'll see her again
[56:54] or maybe there would be one that
[56:56] wouldn't be just exactly where they
[56:57] should be with you I pray you would help
[56:59] them to make things right and
[57:01] and live for you so that they can be
[57:03] there
[57:05] we thank you for the life of sister Gene
[57:07] I
[57:08] I think of brother Robert and what a
[57:10] blessing he is to the church and how
[57:13] much he'll miss her
[57:15] Lord I pray your comforting hand on his
[57:18] life
[57:20] Lord that peace would cover
[57:22] every moment Lord every day there'll be
[57:25] moments when he misses her and he'll
[57:27] begin to think oh I don't know what I'm
[57:29] going to do I I need mother to talk to
[57:32] I need I need her to be there she always
[57:35] listened
[57:37] I pray during that moment Lord that
[57:39] you'd fill in with the peace that passes
[57:41] all understanding
[57:44] Lord I pray you would help each and
[57:46] every one
[57:47] we want most of all to be there we thank
[57:50] you for the life of our sister and we
[57:53] pray Lord that we'd be counted worthy
[57:54] Lord to be Lord where she is at one day

[58:01] sickness
[58:03] from these things Lord that tormented
[58:05] her in this flesh and we thank you for
[58:07] the knowledge that she's in a better
[58:09] place a home that's been prepared for
[58:11] her that is perfect Beyond any
[58:14] understanding of men Lord we thank you
[58:17] for that Comfort the family Lord we pray
[58:20] for each one that's come that you'd
[58:22] bless them and we pray and we ask it in
[58:24] Jesus name
