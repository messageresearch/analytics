[30:55] come and settle down at every Buick know
[30:58] Lord that you've been with us and he
[31:01] promised to lead us and guide us more to
[31:04] be with us into the end of the agency we
[31:06] believe that you're here today doing
[31:14] god bless you what a blessing it is to
[31:19] be in the house of the Lord once again
[31:21] yeah proverbs chapter 14 and verse 26
[31:25] we'll read that one verse of scripture
[31:27] and you can have your seats proverbs 14
[31:31] and 26 it says in the fear of the Lord
[31:36] as strong confidence strong confidence
[31:41] and his children shall have a place of
[31:45] refuge
[31:47] man do we believe that tonight strong
[31:50] confidence that's what we want
[31:52] I pray Lord would add his blessing to
[31:53] the word you may be seated
[32:00] there's a story that's told of Alabama
[32:04] football coach Bear Bryant that one time
[32:08] he was out shooting ducks and after
[32:11] about three hours there comes one duck
[32:13] flying over where they were at he takes
[32:16] a shot at it and just keeps flying and
[32:19] Bear Bryant turned around to the man
[32:21] that was with him and said he said John
[32:24] he said you're witnessing a genuine
[32:25] miracle he said their fly is a dead duck
[32:30] now that's confidence
[32:33] he was just sure he'd hit him you know
[32:37] and I think when we get to shooting at
[32:39] the devil we need to be sure that we hit
[32:41] him we need to have confidence that we
[32:44] were able to to make the shot true and
[32:46] whatever we do in our lives and so as to
[32:49] begin to think on this I I thought and
[32:52] maybe for myself tonight and maybe it'll
[32:54] apply to you as well that we need to
[32:56] have confidence in what we're doing what
[32:58] we're called to do and we need to have
[33:00] confidence in who we are and and first
[33:03] of all as I've looked at this we need to
[33:05] have confidence in God and also we need
[33:08] to have confidence in the Word of God
[33:10] that it's true and we need to also have
[33:12] confidence in ourselves that we are
[33:14] children of God and if we have that then
[33:18] we it's not a confidence that's
[33:20] misplaced because if you put confidence
[33:23] in the flesh your confidence will always
[33:25] be misplaced it'll always you always
[33:28] cause you to be become bitter and become
[33:31] unstable because men will fail the arm
[33:34] of flesh will always fail but God never
[33:37] fails and we're so thankful for that
[33:40] because God is His Word and if he never
[33:43] fails his word never fails as I began to
[33:47] look at these things I realized that
[33:48] there was some men in the Bible that had
[33:51] confidence in God such confidence that
[33:55] they could do things beyond the ordinary
[33:57] and when they were doing these things
[34:00] they actually had such confidence that
[34:03] they could believe that God was who he
[34:07] said he was and also believed that he
[34:10] would keep his word and believed that
[34:12] they were the ones that were to do that
[34:13] and so I picked three and you could pick
[34:16] many more about I looked at the lives of
[34:19] Abraham Moses and Paul - from the Old
[34:23] Testament one from the New Testament and
[34:25] I found that first of all they had to
[34:28] have confidence in God and in order to
[34:31] do that they had to have faith in God
[34:34] because it says without faith it is
[34:35] impossible to please God and Hebrews
[34:38] 11:6 he that cometh to God must believe
[34:41] that he is and that he is a rewarder of
[34:43] them that diligently seek Him so in
[34:45] order to have confidence in what he does
[34:47] you have to have confidence in who he is
[34:50] and the best way that I could explain to
[34:53] you about how to have confidence in God
[34:55] is to meet God right Buster could if you
[34:59] never met him you you don't really know
[35:01] that he exists somebody told you he
[35:05] exists but you never really know until
[35:09] you met him for the first time so if
[35:13] you're if you've never met him and as I
[35:15] begin to look at the lives of these men
[35:17] I realized they had confidence in in God
[35:19] it's Abraham will take him first that he
[35:22] had confidence that God existed and that
[35:25] he was powerful enough to do what he
[35:26] promised but first he had to meet God
[35:29] and when you look at that as I've always
[35:31] looked at Abraham it talks about how
[35:33] Abraham was heard the voice of God and
[35:36] he listened to God and he left his
[35:38] country where he was but he had to meet
[35:41] God
[35:42] and acts seven and to Steven under
[35:45] inspiration is speaking and he tells us
[35:47] a little more of the story of Abraham he
[35:50] said men and brethren and fathers
[35:51] hearken the god of glory appeared to our
[35:56] father Abraham when he was in
[35:58] Mesopotamia before he dwelt in Haran so
[36:03] he says it wasn't just an abstract thing
[36:06] that Abraham hears a voice excuse me but
[36:10] Abraham actually heard from God but he
[36:14] actually met God too so that says the
[36:19] God of glory and what that is is just
[36:20] Shekinah the Jews that he was speaking
[36:23] you would understand that Abraham meant
[36:25] that that visible presence of God what
[36:29] we would call the pillar of fire he met
[36:30] God the God of glory appeared unto our
[36:33] father Abraham when he was in
[36:35] Mesopotamia before he dwelt in Haran and
[36:37] so it wasn't just an abstract thing he
[36:39] believed in God because he met God and
[36:42] then we could go to Moses in Exodus
[36:44] chapter 3 in verse 2 it says the angel
[36:47] of the Lord appeared unto him and a
[36:48] flame of fire out of the midst of a bush
[36:50] this was that visible presence of God
[36:53] again he says he appeared to him out of
[36:57] the midst of a bush and he looked and
[36:58] behold the bush burned with fire and the
[37:00] bush was not consumed so we find then
[37:04] that Moses had to come to a journey in
[37:07] his life and we find up to this point
[37:09] that he was a failure but he had to
[37:11] reach a point where he actually met God
[37:15] and then we find Paul in Acts chapter 9
[37:18] and verse 3 it says as he journeyed he
[37:21] came near Damascus and suddenly there
[37:24] shined round about him a light from
[37:26] heaven and he fell to the earth and he
[37:29] heard a voice saying unto Him Saul Saul
[37:32] why persecutest found me he finally got
[37:34] to meet it and once he had met him he
[37:37] couldn't deny who he was he couldn't
[37:40] deny his existence are you with me now
[37:44] now brother Branham goes into this in
[37:47] some depth and how we have to meet God
[37:49] he said man that's ever born of the
[37:51] Spirit of God meet something that he
[37:55] never gets away from
[37:56] you never gets away from you and brother
[38:01] balance that there's no man got a right
[38:02] to preach the gospel until first he's
[38:05] been on the sacred sands of the backside
[38:08] of the desert
[38:09] there's theologians in this world that
[38:12] smart and shrewd and can explain
[38:13] everything away take everything away he
[38:15] said even a whole Bible they might twist
[38:19] your mind and everything else but if
[38:20] you've ever let God coming to your heart
[38:23] Foley and get the backside of the desert
[38:27] experience then brother all Devils out
[38:30] of hell can't come on that ground he
[38:33] said it's something that's real
[38:35] you met God yourself you can't tell me I
[38:40] can tell you my my father has passed on
[38:42] I can tell you about my dad but you
[38:44] never met him and so you all you know
[38:47] it's what I tell you about it but if you
[38:50] met him you know you know what his
[38:53] character was you know what his life was
[38:55] you know what he stood for you met him
[38:57] Oh church if you could only realize
[38:59] that's what we need to with God you say
[39:01] well how do we get people to come to
[39:03] church how do we get people to do things
[39:05] that are right I don't meet God
[39:07] if you meet God if you meet me you'll
[39:10] forget me but if you ever meet God you
[39:12] won't ever forget it we can introduce
[39:17] them to everything else but if they
[39:18] never get introduced to Christ then
[39:21] they'll go away
[39:21] and they'll continue to be what they
[39:23] always were but now he said if you've
[39:27] ever let God to come into your heart
[39:29] fully he said that that's something real
[39:30] and brother Branham again he says no man
[39:33] has the right to preach the gospel and
[39:36] then he says no person has the right to
[39:38] call themselves a Christian until they
[39:40] can go back to a certain time in their
[39:42] life where they could come on that
[39:44] sacred sands at the backside of the
[39:46] desert where they know that they have
[39:48] met God you say well that's just brother
[39:52] Brandon saying that that's what the
[39:53] Bible teaches we have to meet God not
[39:56] just meeting a church not just meeting a
[39:58] preacher or a prophet meeting God he
[40:02] said all the infidels in the world and
[40:04] these intellectual Giants taking the
[40:06] Bible and explaining away all the days
[40:08] of miracles
[40:09] past there's no such thing as divine
[40:11] healing all this stuff like speaking
[40:13] with tongues interpretation of towns
[40:15] gifts of healing the baptism of the holy
[40:17] spirit they can wear the brown said they
[40:19] can slip in take your mind and twist you
[40:22] in such a way until they can take that
[40:24] away from your memory are you with me so
[40:27] I could teach you to a place about this
[40:29] message that you would believe it with
[40:31] your mind but another person could come
[40:34] in with more intellectualism
[40:36] and twist that and take it away from
[40:39] your memory but if I could ever get you
[40:42] to meet the one that I met and that's
[40:46] why brother Brown tells young preachers
[40:47] he said if you don't know anything else
[40:49] to preach tell them how the fire got lit
[40:50] because if you could ever meet the man
[40:53] that I met oh my
[40:55] then you'd be well if you could ever
[40:58] meet that man if you could ever come on
[41:00] those sacred sands he says but they can
[41:02] slip in and take your mind twist you in
[41:04] such a way until they can take that away
[41:06] from your memory they can explain it
[41:08] away but the brown says I want you to
[41:11] get this note you never let it pass from
[41:14] you but if a man's ever stood on that
[41:16] sacred sand at the backside of the
[41:19] desert when he meets God face to face
[41:21] there's not enough Devils in hell that
[41:24] could take that away from him
[41:26] he knows he met God he knows he had an
[41:30] experience he talked to God you could
[41:33] tell me your brother penis you know that
[41:35] didn't mean anything but to me I talked
[41:37] to God you weren't there I was there it
[41:42] was just me and God but I talked to God
[41:44] I want my kids to be able to meet God
[41:47] like that
[41:48] I want this church I want us all to be
[41:52] able to meet God like that if you
[41:53] haven't already met him let's meet him
[41:55] tonight he's here he's available he's
[41:58] ready to meet you he knows he met God he
[42:01] said he knows he had an experience he
[42:04] talked to God regardless of what the
[42:06] opposition is he can say from that time
[42:10] something changed in me and it may not
[42:15] have been the same because if you look
[42:17] at these experiences that Abraham had in
[42:20] that Moses had that Paul had each one
[42:22] them was unique in how they met God and
[42:26] if you tried to take Abraham and take
[42:29] that over to Moses and Moses and take
[42:31] that over to Paul there's there's
[42:32] completely different scenarios but the
[42:36] same light the same God that they meant
[42:40] now he said from that time something
[42:43] changed in me and brother Branham says
[42:45] how well I can call the time he said in
[42:49] a little old saloon that it being used
[42:52] as a church we said were some color
[42:55] people with preaching the gospel I loved
[42:58] the way God did this my brother Branham
[43:02] tells the story about a man and wanted
[43:04] to be saved and and he asked his hired
[43:07] hand how to be saved because he knew he
[43:08] was a Christian and the hired hand man
[43:11] took him up to he was the owner of the
[43:12] farm and took him up into the hayloft
[43:14] where's all the nice say he said maybe I
[43:16] could get it up here he said no he said
[43:18] no he can't get it up here he took him
[43:21] down in the barn and where it was nice
[43:22] and and everything was cleaned up he
[43:24] said maybe we get it here he said no and
[43:26] he laid him out in the middle of the hog
[43:27] pen when the mud was up to his knees and
[43:31] he said oh I don't think I want it here
[43:33] he said then you don't want it this is
[43:36] where you get it and so brother Brown
[43:38] said I was a southerner and didn't like
[43:40] colored people he said in the vision
[43:43] came and told me where to go find it he
[43:46] said all the white girls that I went
[43:48] with not all of them four or five
[43:49] standing there said Billy you're not
[43:51] going in there I said yes I've got to go
[43:53] said don't ever ask me for another date
[43:56] he said it didn't make any difference
[43:57] I meant God and from that time I've been
[44:01] changed can point back to that time I
[44:03] was changed brother Branham had God had
[44:08] to lead him into a black church think
[44:12] about it for a moment he said from that
[44:14] time I changed sometimes God got to get
[44:17] you out of your comfort zone shake
[44:20] things up a little bit sometimes the you
[44:23] know he's been shaking things up it
[44:25] feels sometimes like you're in a dryer
[44:26] and you just keep tumbling along
[44:29] tumbling around like that pair of tennis
[44:31] shoes that you throw in the dryer and
[44:32] you can hear it that's the way you feel
[44:33] sometimes but God's gonna shake you up
[44:36] so that he can get your attention he
[44:40] said from that time he said I've been
[44:42] changed and he said no man has a right
[44:46] to preach the gospel until he's knelt on
[44:48] those sacred sands back there in the
[44:51] presence of that pillar of fire and
[44:52] heard the voice of God speak to him he
[44:55] said you know the religions today can
[44:57] explain it all away
[44:58] and this happened and that's gone this
[45:01] is for another age and this but a man
[45:03] that's ever met God face to face and
[45:06] talked to him there's no scientist no
[45:10] devil or nothing else can come on that
[45:13] sacred sound sacred ground he was there
[45:16] when he met God he knows what he's
[45:19] talking about is no need of anybody else
[45:22] trying to tell him he said well that's
[45:25] pretty good for a preacher but listen to
[45:26] this quote this is in future home in
[45:29] 1964 brother bana said no man no person
[45:34] so no man no person no woman boy girl
[45:38] that about covers it he said I don't
[45:41] care who he is it's fit to go in the
[45:44] pulpit or even claim to be a Christian
[45:47] without being filled with the Holy Ghost
[45:49] he said you have no right to the Lord's
[45:52] Supper communion Fit washing or anything
[45:54] until you've been cleansed by the holy
[45:56] fire of God that's pretty strong in it
[46:00] she's gotta meet God you've gotta meet
[46:03] God he said no man has a right to preach
[46:06] unless you like Moses meets him out
[46:08] there on those sacred grounds that
[46:10] pillar of fire hanging there where he
[46:12] knows where he's at
[46:14] what is it it gives you confidence in
[46:16] God I'm manic Abraham said I met him in
[46:21] his glory Moses said could say I met him
[46:26] in the burning bush and Paul could say I
[46:30] met him on the road to Damascus so I can
[46:33] have confidence in who he is and based
[46:36] on the fact that he is he exists he's
[46:38] real I know that he's real then I know
[46:41] he can keep his word see you've got to
[46:44] have confidence in the Word of God if
[46:45] you believe that he is God you've got to
[46:48] also believe that in his
[46:50] right and his word has to be true if his
[46:53] word is not true he's not God because
[46:57] it's impossible for God the kind of God
[47:00] that we understand to lie God can't lie
[47:03] God can't tell an untruth you can't tell
[47:05] a half truth God tells the truth and
[47:09] everything that comes out of his mouth
[47:11] it's true and not only true but will
[47:14] come to pass so in in Genesis 12 for
[47:19] were find again with Abraham that Abram
[47:22] departed as the Lord had spoken unto him
[47:24] and so the fact that he had met God
[47:28] caused him to obey the Word of God and I
[47:32] think that's a problem we've got today
[47:34] because a whole lot of people that claim
[47:36] to have met God won't obey the word if
[47:40] you don't obey the word then you didn't
[47:42] meet God obedience to the word brother
[47:46] branham said even entitles you to the
[47:48] token right and so you got to be able to
[47:52] believe the Word of God and then follow
[47:54] the Word of God so Abram did what the
[47:57] Lord spoken to him and then we find that
[48:01] he was it was said of him by faith
[48:03] Abraham when he was called to go out
[48:05] into a place which he should have to
[48:07] receive for an inheritance obeyed and he
[48:10] went out not knowing whither he went let
[48:13] me explain to you and something that
[48:16] I've seen over the years that and you've
[48:19] seen this - if you'll think about it if
[48:21] you've been around for very long if you
[48:24] want to be blessed by God obey the word
[48:27] just obey the word it's not so much
[48:31] being blessed in figuring out what parts
[48:34] of the word that you don't understand
[48:35] but obey what we understand if there's
[48:39] something there and you see it you just
[48:41] walk in it you just walk in it you just
[48:44] keep walking in you just keep obeying
[48:46] the word and when you start obeying the
[48:48] word fully and it may be something
[48:50] little it may be something that doesn't
[48:52] seem like it has any consequence at all
[48:54] but when you start obeying God in this
[48:56] little thing God begins to bless you
[48:59] because you're now moving under that it
[49:02] station of obedience to God you can come
[49:05] fully in the will of God but before you
[49:07] do that you actually whenever you
[49:09] disobey God you bring yourselves out
[49:11] from under that protection and that
[49:14] blessing when you obey God as Abraham
[49:17] did it gives you rights and it gives you
[49:20] confidence and we'll talk about that a
[49:22] little bit more but it gives you
[49:24] confidence in God that he'll keep his
[49:26] word now we can have confidence in a lot
[49:32] of people but and we're going to talk
[49:34] about in a moment but you're better off
[49:36] to have confidence in what God has done
[49:38] in your life if you can see God and so
[49:42] many times we see what God does in
[49:43] somebody else's life and we see that
[49:45] it's a wonderful thing and it inspires
[49:47] us if we seek God heal the sick if we
[49:51] seek God do what he promised he would do
[49:53] it gives us inspiration we believe God
[49:55] can do that again don't we we believe if
[49:58] he's done it before he can do it again
[49:59] but what if he does it for you see if he
[50:02] does it for you then you have confidence
[50:04] so much confidence because I know not
[50:06] just that God did it for my mom God did
[50:08] it for my dad God did it for somebody
[50:09] else but God did it for me God did it
[50:13] for me because he did it for me I know
[50:15] that he's able to do it for my children
[50:17] I know he's able to do it for the young
[50:19] people I know he's able to do it for the
[50:21] old people I know he's able to meet the
[50:23] needs so we have here tonight why
[50:24] because he's met my need and if he's met
[50:29] my need and if he's Lucifer naturally in
[50:31] my life that I know he can move in yours
[50:34] right and so the confidence that we have
[50:37] as Christians is built from the fact
[50:40] that we have met God and we followed the
[50:43] word and we've obeyed God and we can
[50:46] look back for the Harvard those years so
[50:48] we could say I was once like you but I
[50:51] met God when I met God I turned him in
[50:53] another direction and now I can look at
[50:56] my life and say with confidence God led
[50:58] me God was working in me and you can
[51:03] look back over those years you can say
[51:05] if you can follow the God that I
[51:07] followed you can receive the help that I
[51:09] received you can you can experience the
[51:13] miracles that I experienced
[51:15] are you with me now and again it won't
[51:19] happen the same way for everybody but
[51:21] still we all have to meet God we all
[51:23] have to follow his word and we will all
[51:26] be blessed by that now look Moses when
[51:32] he obeyed God what did he do he took his
[51:34] life and sons and he would set them upon
[51:38] a nasty return to the land of Egypt and
[51:39] Moses took the rod of God in his hand
[51:41] brother matter said he a little
[51:43] bald-headed guy with a beard he said was
[51:45] going down to Egypt to take over put his
[51:48] wife and kids on the donkey and he was
[51:50] he was going down to Egypt and he said
[51:52] somebody harder and where are you going
[51:53] Moses I'm going out to Egypt to take
[51:55] over and it would seem like an insane
[51:58] thing to say but he had confidence why
[52:02] he even following God and he knew the
[52:04] same God that met him in a burning bush
[52:07] would also deliver the children of
[52:09] Israel so he had the confidence to obey
[52:12] God so we find that Paul did the same
[52:15] thing in Acts chapter 9 verse 17 will
[52:18] read the next few verses he said in Anna
[52:20] and I have swin his way and entered into
[52:22] the house and putting his hands on him
[52:23] said brother Saul the Lord even jesus
[52:26] said appeared unto thee in the way of
[52:27] Psych amos has sent me that down -
[52:29] received that side and be filled with
[52:31] the Holy Ghost and immediately there
[52:34] fell from his eyes had been scales and
[52:36] he received sight forthwith and arose
[52:39] and was baptized when he had received
[52:42] meat he was strengthened and then was
[52:44] saw certain days with the disciples
[52:46] which were at Damascus and straightway
[52:51] notice the same guy that a few days
[52:54] before had been had been persecuting the
[52:59] church doing everything he could to stop
[53:02] it
[53:02] and he said in straightway he preached
[53:05] Christ in the synagogue's that he is the
[53:08] son of God you can imagine that first
[53:11] sermon those men would have known Paul
[53:16] he walks up there with his with his book
[53:19] and he opens up the scroll I said today
[53:21] we're gonna read from the Book of Isaiah
[53:23] and we're gonna prove that Jesus Christ
[53:26] is the Messiah
[53:29] you talk about the stir in the church
[53:31] there was enough there was a there was a
[53:34] depth roar that day because Paul was
[53:37] standing up against what do you know
[53:39] he'd always stood against it now he was
[53:41] standing for it well I met God and he
[53:44] obeyed God's Word he met God he followed
[53:47] the Word of God but it says but all that
[53:50] heard him were amazed sure they were and
[53:53] said it's not this he that destroyed
[53:55] them which called on this name of
[53:56] Jerusalem came hither for that intent
[53:58] then he might bring them bound unto the
[54:00] chief priests but Saul increased some
[54:03] more in strength and confounded the Jews
[54:06] which dwelt at Damascus
[54:07] proving that this is very Christ why he
[54:12] met God and he followed God but the
[54:17] batter
[54:17] mentions this about our confidence in
[54:20] the Word of God he says have you ever
[54:23] noticed how Satan hates two books of the
[54:25] Bible more than all others through
[54:28] liberal theologians and pseudoscientist
[54:30] he's always attacking the book of
[54:31] Genesis and the book of Revelation and
[54:35] both of these books we find Satan's
[54:37] origin his awful ways in its destruction
[54:40] that's why he attacks him he hates to be
[54:43] exposed in those books he's exposed for
[54:46] exactly what he is jesus said about
[54:50] Satan here it's no part of me and I have
[54:51] no part in him he said the devil would
[54:54] like to prove that different but he
[54:56] can't so he does all he can to destroy
[54:59] confidence in the word that's what Satan
[55:05] is working at constantly in your life to
[55:08] destroy your confidence in the work any
[55:12] way that he can do it he doesn't care
[55:16] you see I talk to you about how that is
[55:18] ministers in the gospel we have to use
[55:20] the right means to the gospel we don't
[55:23] use deceptive means to preach the gospel
[55:26] we don't use deceptive methods we're not
[55:30] going to call everybody in for a an
[55:33] Easter egg hunt dropped from a
[55:35] helicopter right we're not we're not
[55:39] going to start taking all the the lyrics
[55:41] out of our songs that relate to the
[55:43] blood of Christ and just start singing
[55:45] where everybody would be pleased with it
[55:46] we don't use deceptive methods we
[55:49] believe what we believe
[55:50] right and we preach what we believe but
[55:53] Satan does he loves deceptive methods
[55:57] he loves to try to prove that he's one
[56:01] with the word he loves to try to prove
[56:04] and destroy your confidence in the word
[56:06] he said but when the church disbelieved
[56:08] Satan and believes the spirits
[56:11] revelation of the word the gates of Hell
[56:13] cannot prevail against her amen so
[56:18] brother man makes the same ISA don't put
[56:21] your confidence in a man he said when
[56:23] that man leaves the Word of God you
[56:25] leave the man he said you leave the man
[56:28] stay with God God is the word that's
[56:33] what the church is built on us to work
[56:35] you don't take my word over the Word of
[56:37] God shame on you if you take my word
[56:40] over the Word of God shame on us if we
[56:43] take a man's word even a prophets word
[56:45] over the Word of God about we take a
[56:47] prophet's word because it lines up with
[56:49] the word of God right he said don't put
[56:53] your confidence in a man he said when a
[56:55] man leaves sword of God you leave the
[56:57] man si you leave the man stay with God
[56:59] God is two word brother branham talked
[57:03] about this and in this confidence and we
[57:06] know that and when we have confidence
[57:08] with God it has to be caused by
[57:12] something there has to be something that
[57:14] brings that confidence and so it can't
[57:17] be we can't have confidence in a in a
[57:20] cold relationship does that make sense
[57:23] if you've never met God and if we could
[57:27] say it this way if you don't love God
[57:29] then you can't really have confidence in
[57:32] God and you can't really believe his
[57:35] word because you really don't love him
[57:39] and brother Branham uses the
[57:42] illustration of a married couple he said
[57:44] it just happened here in Louisville he
[57:46] said a woman has been a Christian for
[57:47] many years but her husband had she fell
[57:49] in love with this man he had been a
[57:50] Christian a couple of years he said so
[57:53] they got married and they loved and had
[57:55] coffee
[57:55] one another and they got married and the
[57:57] woman said to the man said hobby it must
[57:59] be hard on you
[58:00] you're just a young Christian you've had
[58:03] so much to go through with and what it
[58:06] was was he had a drinking problem before
[58:08] he become a Christian she said you've
[58:10] had so much to go through within these
[58:12] he and said I know you're bound to be
[58:15] tempted awfully hard and said I want you
[58:17] to know one thing now now if you happen
[58:20] to fall into temptation and has overcome
[58:23] don't stay away from home you come on
[58:25] back you come right here cuz I'm gonna
[58:28] be right here waiting for you and I'm
[58:30] gonna help you pray through again until
[58:31] you get victory I'm gonna stay with you
[58:34] because when I married you I married you
[58:36] because I loved you no matter what you
[58:39] are I still love you what an attitude to
[58:44] have in a marriage and I think we can
[58:45] extrapolate that even farther to a
[58:47] church that when it comes to these
[58:50] things
[58:51] I won't we can't condone what people do
[58:54] but we want them to come to church and
[58:58] this is where you get help we don't want
[59:00] you to stay out there come back if you
[59:03] mess up come to church if you do
[59:06] something you know is wrong come to the
[59:08] house of God we don't want you to stay
[59:10] that way but we want you to get help and
[59:13] we know you can get help here we believe
[59:16] we have confidence in what we're what
[59:18] we're teaching what we're believing
[59:19] we're not embarrassed the years ago
[59:22] someone don't come to the church and
[59:25] preach that we should not parent our
[59:27] children out of embarrassment it's
[59:28] always stuck with me because many times
[59:31] we do that you know you go to the store
[59:34] and your kids start acting up you get
[59:35] embarrassed and there's nothing to makes
[59:38] you more proud than going into a store
[59:40] and people compliment and how your kids
[59:41] behave right that had this actually
[59:45] happened to me today I was just shocked
[59:47] you know but you know when you go into a
[59:49] store and I guess they'd had some really
[59:51] bad kids in there that day but you know
[59:54] today but you know s you nothing nothing
[59:58] uplifts you more but sometimes you get
[1:00:00] embarrassed by but you know what they're
[1:00:03] just kids
[1:00:04] getting embarrassed doesn't help anybody
[1:00:07] right
[1:00:08] parent out of embarrassment then the
[1:00:10] kids just learned how to be good actors
[1:00:12] they don't learn how to be good they
[1:00:15] just learn how to act good and sometimes
[1:00:19] I think that's what we create in church
[1:00:20] is we create good actors people who know
[1:00:24] how to come to church and sit just right
[1:00:26] the way that message the people are
[1:00:28] supposed to sit you know and sit there
[1:00:30] and quietly before the service and raise
[1:00:32] their hand at all the right times and
[1:00:34] and and leave quietly at the end of the
[1:00:36] service we create good actors we don't
[1:00:40] want people to act good we want them to
[1:00:42] be good we want them to be saved all
[1:00:46] right so we can't run a church out of
[1:00:49] embarrassment
[1:00:50] well I that person that comes to me we'd
[1:00:52] be embarrassed by them coming to church
[1:00:54] no we want to be a hospital where the
[1:00:57] sick can come and get well we don't want
[1:01:00] them to stay sick we want him to get
[1:01:01] well how you gonna get well by the
[1:01:03] preaching of the word are you gonna get
[1:01:05] well about the whole of the spirit well
[1:01:08] you come under this atmosphere and I
[1:01:10] think of the little girl and excuse me
[1:01:12] for just preaching freely getting away
[1:01:13] from my notes tonight but it's like that
[1:01:15] little girl that was down down there in
[1:01:17] a foreign country and and her captain or
[1:01:20] her master was named in the Syrian she
[1:01:23] went down there and naman was was I was
[1:01:26] a leper and she said what God you were
[1:01:27] in my country she said because we have a
[1:01:30] prophet and we have a promise of healing
[1:01:32] amen and I think we can be the same way
[1:01:35] to night that we can actually speak to
[1:01:37] those that are on the outside and say I
[1:01:39] wish you into my church because we may
[1:01:42] be flawed but we have a healer we may be
[1:01:45] hurt sometimes but we have a savior we
[1:01:48] may have trouble sometimes but we know
[1:01:50] the master of the wind we know somebody
[1:01:53] who can take care of the problems of
[1:01:55] your life we know somebody if you're if
[1:01:58] you're strung out on drugs if you're
[1:01:59] strung out on alcohol if you find
[1:02:01] yourself with marriage six or seven
[1:02:03] times if you find yourself with all
[1:02:05] kinds of trouble
[1:02:05] come here that's just the kind Jesus
[1:02:08] went to and we believe Jesus is walking
[1:02:10] in flesh today if you happen to fall
[1:02:15] invitation or overcome don't stay away
[1:02:18] from home come here
[1:02:22] people are too embarrassed just forgive
[1:02:26] me for a moment people are too
[1:02:28] embarrassed to come to church because
[1:02:29] somebody did something wrong well just
[1:02:32] because you don't know what everybody
[1:02:33] else did doesn't mean we're not all
[1:02:35] sinners people do things that are wrong
[1:02:38] we serve a living God we serve a God of
[1:02:42] miracles we serve a God who can overcome
[1:02:46] in us well the random said a few days
[1:02:51] after this woman told her husband that
[1:02:54] he said he was he eating his lunch with
[1:02:56] the fellas down the boiler room he was
[1:02:57] telling them about it said no how could
[1:03:00] a man ever do anything wrong
[1:03:01] when somebody loves you like that he
[1:03:05] said see there you are how could you
[1:03:06] trespass that confidence he said when we
[1:03:11] were sinners alienated without God in
[1:03:14] the world in that muck of mud
[1:03:17] he said God come to us God taught you
[1:03:22] you never saw God no man can come to me
[1:03:25] except the father draws him first
[1:03:27] and God came down in that muck what you
[1:03:31] were and sought you out and brought you
[1:03:34] out
[1:03:35] he said that ought to create a perfect
[1:03:37] love look what she was look what you are
[1:03:43] not just a clinical thing where we sit
[1:03:45] here and divide all the all the words
[1:03:48] and everything just right but look what
[1:03:49] you were look what you were look what
[1:03:53] look what was camping in your life and
[1:03:55] look what's happening now look what's
[1:03:58] happening Christ is moving in your life
[1:04:00] today why what did that somebody that
[1:04:02] loves you he said can't you have faith
[1:04:05] in what he's promised you then real
[1:04:08] genuine love will create a confidence in
[1:04:11] His Word if we could ever learn to love
[1:04:16] him right we would be sure that the word
[1:04:19] is true Peter says in 2nd Peter 1:16 he
[1:04:24] said we have not followed cunningly
[1:04:27] devised fables when we made ownit you
[1:04:30] the power and coming of our Lord Jesus
[1:04:32] Christ but we were
[1:04:34] eyewitnesses of his majesty for he
[1:04:38] received from God the Father honor and
[1:04:40] glory when there came such a voice to
[1:04:43] him from the excellent glory and this is
[1:04:45] that idea of the presence of God on the
[1:04:48] Mount of Transfiguration he says this is
[1:04:51] my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased
[1:04:55] and this voice which came from heaven
[1:04:59] we heard the hard way I think that's a
[1:05:03] problem a lot of people in the message
[1:05:04] have today they never heard the voice
[1:05:06] from heaven Peter said we heard it so
[1:05:09] we've not followed cunningly devised
[1:05:10] fables if you haven't heard the voice
[1:05:13] from heaven if all you hear its the
[1:05:15] earthly voice mother Brown said that
[1:05:17] voice from heaven was predestination if
[1:05:20] you've only heard the voice from Earth
[1:05:22] then you can't be sure of what you're
[1:05:26] talking about but if you've ever heard
[1:05:29] the voice that came from another rail
[1:05:31] ever heard the voice from heaven Peter
[1:05:34] said we know what we're talking about we
[1:05:35] have confidence in the word because the
[1:05:37] voice we heard was from heaven the voice
[1:05:42] we heard was from heaven when we were
[1:05:43] with him on the holy mouth
[1:05:45] he said we have also a more sure word of
[1:05:48] prophecy where until you do well that
[1:05:51] you take heed as unto a light that
[1:05:53] shines in a dark place until the day
[1:05:55] dawn and the day star arise in your
[1:05:58] heart so Peter is telling them that
[1:06:00] everybody thinks they know what prophecy
[1:06:02] means everybody has an interpretation
[1:06:05] everybody's got an idea and now Peter
[1:06:09] comes to him and he says but we know
[1:06:11] what it means because we lived it we
[1:06:14] know what it means because we heard the
[1:06:16] voice from heaven we know what it means
[1:06:19] because it's real in our lives it's not
[1:06:22] just a concept but it's a reality we
[1:06:26] have a more sure word of prophecy as a
[1:06:28] word do you do well that you take heed
[1:06:30] unto a light that shine it's in a dark
[1:06:32] place until the day dawn the day star
[1:06:34] arise in your hearts knowing this first
[1:06:37] no prophecy of the scripture is of any
[1:06:41] private interpretation but the Branham
[1:06:43] explains that this way God interprets
[1:06:45] this word by bringing it to pass
[1:06:48] you want to know if the message is true
[1:06:50] see if it works in your life I challenge
[1:06:53] you to give it a chance give it a chance
[1:06:56] to work in your life if all the message
[1:06:59] does produce misery to you then you
[1:07:01] haven't found what I found because the
[1:07:04] message didn't produce misery to me but
[1:07:06] the message produced a life of joy and
[1:07:08] peace and and a life that I know that
[1:07:10] even if I mess up like God hasn't thrown
[1:07:12] me away but he's right there for me hey
[1:07:16] man I know that I know that the no
[1:07:18] prophecy of the scripture is of any
[1:07:19] private interpretation because I know
[1:07:22] he's become real in my life he said for
[1:07:24] the prophecy came not in old time by the
[1:07:26] will of man so if the prophecy didn't
[1:07:29] come by the will of man the
[1:07:30] interpretation doesn't come by the will
[1:07:31] of man you don't just say it means
[1:07:34] something and it come to pass but it
[1:07:36] means it because it came to pass are you
[1:07:40] with me now it came to pass God did what
[1:07:43] he said he would do when God's
[1:07:46] Malachi 4 we could make that mean all
[1:07:48] kinds of things but we know it means
[1:07:50] what it means because God did it right
[1:07:54] and the other scripture is the same in
[1:07:56] 2nd Peter it's so 2nd Peter 1:21 he said
[1:08:01] the prophecy came not in old time to the
[1:08:02] will of man but holy men of God spake as
[1:08:04] they were moved by the Holy Ghost 2nd
[1:08:09] Peter 3:16 he's speaking of Paul's
[1:08:13] epistles I love this 4 Peter saying I
[1:08:17] got what I believe not by a cunningly
[1:08:20] devised fables for
[1:08:21] I heard a voice from heaven said this is
[1:08:25] my beloved son it was my personal
[1:08:27] experience I believe in I'm willing to
[1:08:30] die for it because I was there I know
[1:08:33] he's risen from the dead I was there I
[1:08:36] saw the tomb Peter could say that but
[1:08:39] now he turns 4 and he says that he talks
[1:08:43] about our beloved brother Paul and he
[1:08:44] says it's also in all his epistles
[1:08:46] speaking in them of these things in
[1:08:48] which are some things hard to be
[1:08:51] understood which they that are unlearned
[1:08:53] and unstable wrest they wrestle with it
[1:08:56] as they do also the other scriptures to
[1:08:59] their own destruction what's
[1:09:02] saying that the words apostle wasn't
[1:09:04] just those who were there but Paul never
[1:09:07] met Christ in the flesh
[1:09:09] but he met him in the pillar of fire all
[1:09:13] right and so he also wrote the scripture
[1:09:15] and he said they wrestle with those
[1:09:18] scriptures that Paul wrote just like
[1:09:20] they do the other scriptures the Old
[1:09:21] Testament unto their own destruction 2nd
[1:09:26] Timothy 3:16 all scripture now this is
[1:09:29] Paul speaking all Scripture is given by
[1:09:32] inspiration that word its expression is
[1:09:34] god-breathed God breathed of God it is
[1:09:39] profitable for doctrine for reproof for
[1:09:41] correction for instruction in
[1:09:43] righteousness so what can I pin my soul
[1:09:47] on all of it and I have to be able to
[1:09:51] have any confidence in it at all if I
[1:09:54] can't put my soul on every word of it I
[1:09:56] haven't I can't have no confidence in it
[1:09:58] because of God that can't keep the
[1:10:00] Scriptures whole how's it going to keep
[1:10:03] my life oh god that could give the
[1:10:07] scripture my inspiration could also keep
[1:10:09] it are you with me now but even having
[1:10:13] it just in this form would never help me
[1:10:16] but the same God that gave up my
[1:10:18] inspiration I've got to receive it by
[1:10:21] inspiration the same God has got to come
[1:10:24] and live in my life and begin to show me
[1:10:26] and reveal to me his word but all
[1:10:28] Scripture is given by inspiration or
[1:10:31] exploration of God it's God breathed so
[1:10:35] we can have confidence in it what else
[1:10:36] can we have confidence in we can have
[1:10:39] confidence in ourselves and that seems
[1:10:43] like it makes you pause doesn't it it
[1:10:46] made me pause because if you've been
[1:10:52] around me very long you know that I
[1:10:53] that's if I struggle with something
[1:10:55] that's not necessarily been
[1:10:56] overconfident it's been under confident
[1:10:58] and and there's pros and cons to both
[1:11:01] sides if under confident is a word I'm
[1:11:05] questioning myself about that I
[1:11:06] questioned myself a lot and that you
[1:11:10] find two types of people basically those
[1:11:12] who question themselves all the time and
[1:11:14] those that don't question themselves
[1:11:15] and it'd be nice if you'd be somewhere
[1:11:18] in the middle but it takes all of us to
[1:11:19] balance those things out but we do have
[1:11:23] to have confidence in ourselves when it
[1:11:25] comes to the fact that we're children of
[1:11:27] God we've got to have confidence in that
[1:11:32] we've got to know that just like we know
[1:11:36] you're Joey you know you're Joey wait
[1:11:38] maybe you may have been putting on to me
[1:11:40] but you know you could you could pass
[1:11:47] yourself off as someone else for a while
[1:11:48] you can steal somebody's identity but
[1:11:51] you know right and you've got to have
[1:11:54] confidence in yourself knowing you're a
[1:11:58] child of God you might come to church
[1:12:00] assimilate with believers act like all
[1:12:02] the believers do but you've got to have
[1:12:04] something I've got to have something
[1:12:05] that we know I know I'm a child of God
[1:12:10] hey man so when Paul speaks to people
[1:12:15] and he speaks to them about what God is
[1:12:17] doing in their lives he's fixed him like
[1:12:19] this he said being confident of this
[1:12:21] very thing that he which has begun a
[1:12:24] good work in you will perform it until
[1:12:27] the day of Jesus Christ so if I can see
[1:12:32] a beginning if I can see that you met
[1:12:35] God I can see your life Kurt to change I
[1:12:38] know God will continue to perform it you
[1:12:40] may have ups and downs you may have
[1:12:42] times when you're less spiritual than at
[1:12:44] other times
[1:12:45] you may have times we disagree you may
[1:12:47] have piles when you go back and forth
[1:12:49] the maybe you don't feel like coming to
[1:12:51] church and all kinds of different things
[1:12:52] but I'm confident of this that he which
[1:12:55] began a good work will finish it hey Ben
[1:13:00] the God who met me hey man the God who
[1:13:04] gives me the word I can have confidence
[1:13:06] in it's the same God it will perform his
[1:13:10] word in me so then what do I have to
[1:13:12] worry about it's not up to me ultimately
[1:13:15] though I work and though I I struggle to
[1:13:19] do his will but it's not up to me
[1:13:21] ultimately it's up to him so he says I'm
[1:13:25] confident of this and then second
[1:13:28] Corinthians
[1:13:28] 7:16 he said I rejoice therefore that I
[1:13:31] have confidence in you in all things now
[1:13:34] Paul was basing that on something
[1:13:37] because he had been told they were
[1:13:38] pinioned
[1:13:40] right and so they saw that they had
[1:13:42] repented and so he said I have
[1:13:44] confidence in you in all things I think
[1:13:47] we have ought to have more confidence
[1:13:48] than those we go to church with Paul
[1:13:52] says I have confidence in you through
[1:13:53] the Lord in Galatians 5:10 that you'll
[1:13:56] be none otherwise minded he speaks very
[1:14:00] positively to them after speaking very
[1:14:02] negatively to them and to calling them
[1:14:06] basically fools for having gone back
[1:14:08] into Judaism but he said I have
[1:14:10] confidence in you hey man I like what
[1:14:14] Paul says if any man draw back my social
[1:14:16] have no pleasure in him he said but we
[1:14:18] are not of those that draw back a man
[1:14:21] and and he just says that confidently
[1:14:24] and he says that and so everyone that
[1:14:26] hears him is that way he said we were we
[1:14:28] are not of them that draw back but we
[1:14:30] heard them to believe hey man we should
[1:14:34] have that kind of confidence in
[1:14:35] ourselves and in those were we got-we
[1:14:38] fellowship with I have confidence in you
[1:14:41] through the Lord that you'll be none
[1:14:42] otherwise minded but he the trouble with
[1:14:43] you shall bear his judgment whosoever he
[1:14:46] be 1st John 3:21
[1:14:49] let's look at this because this is part
[1:14:52] of it we're gonna have confidence with
[1:14:55] God and I'm you know we're gonna get out
[1:14:56] of here pretty quick tonight so you just
[1:15:00] hang with me if our heart condemn us not
[1:15:04] then we have confidence toward God now
[1:15:08] he doesn't say if our heart condemn it's
[1:15:09] not we're saved because if we were only
[1:15:12] saved when our heart didn't condemn us
[1:15:14] we'd have a problem we'd have to get
[1:15:16] resaved a lot right and so he says if if
[1:15:21] our heart condemn us God is greater than
[1:15:23] our heart God knows everything God knows
[1:15:27] the truth about it but now he says if
[1:15:29] our heart condemn us not then we have
[1:15:31] confidence toward God so what it does is
[1:15:33] if we're living in a way we know isn't
[1:15:35] right according to the word it's hard to
[1:15:37] have confidence
[1:15:41] you realize Church that what we need is
[1:15:45] not just more emotional more music or
[1:15:50] more people I hope you're with me
[1:15:53] tonight well what we need if I could
[1:15:57] just put all of us in the same bucket
[1:16:00] and I know that's not necessarily true
[1:16:01] but kind of put us all together well
[1:16:05] what do we need we need to have people
[1:16:07] who have confidence in God and
[1:16:10] confidence in their own lives but you
[1:16:15] see people constantly defeated
[1:16:17] constantly getting resaved at every
[1:16:19] meeting and you wonder why do people
[1:16:21] have to go through that why do they
[1:16:22] never have enough confidence it's hard
[1:16:25] to find people even with enough
[1:16:26] confidence in their walk to pray in
[1:16:29] church or to or to talk to God or or to
[1:16:31] do the things that they need to do or to
[1:16:33] lay hands on someone else that's sick
[1:16:34] they said they'd say well I wish the
[1:16:36] pastor was here and I would be able to
[1:16:38] do that I wish someone else was here no
[1:16:39] you know you can lay hands on the sick
[1:16:42] you can reach out and you could be a
[1:16:44] prayer warrior but we go day after day
[1:16:48] after day without praying believe me
[1:16:50] I've been there and you go to work in
[1:16:53] his heart and so you you learn to get up
[1:16:55] in the morning and drink your coffee and
[1:16:57] go to work and you begin to forget about
[1:16:59] the things of God you begin to let it go
[1:17:00] and let it slide and after a while you
[1:17:02] look back at your own life and just have
[1:17:04] no confidence at all so when you go to
[1:17:07] church you're beat downing you you're
[1:17:09] worried and and you come to church and
[1:17:10] say well I hope the preacher don't
[1:17:12] preach at me today I hope you don't
[1:17:13] mention that because I know it's not
[1:17:15] right well I live like that it's the
[1:17:20] grace of God that were saved anyway if
[1:17:23] we're gonna make it it's gonna be by the
[1:17:24] grace of God but if there's something in
[1:17:28] your life that you know is wrong quit
[1:17:30] doing it or start doing it maybe
[1:17:34] something you should be doing and most
[1:17:37] of the time almost a hundred percent of
[1:17:40] the time we know what those things are
[1:17:42] you don't have to have me come to the
[1:17:44] house of God every Wednesday night and
[1:17:46] sit here run down a list of all the
[1:17:48] things you do that are wrong or all the
[1:17:52] things you should do that are right
[1:17:54] but we know there's something within us
[1:17:56] that and Paul puts it this way said you
[1:17:58] have no need a man to teach you because
[1:18:01] you have the Holy Spirit there's things
[1:18:02] that you know you know what you should
[1:18:04] be doing you know when you should be
[1:18:06] praying you know when you should be
[1:18:07] rejoicing you know when you should be
[1:18:10] getting into the service you know when
[1:18:12] those I don't have to beat you over the
[1:18:13] head about that but if our heart condemn
[1:18:15] us man we have no confidence toward God
[1:18:17] and so we come sheepishly to the throne
[1:18:20] but Paul said let's come boldly to the
[1:18:22] throne of grace let's believe that God's
[1:18:24] gonna do what we ask him to do let's
[1:18:28] come to church with confidence that
[1:18:29] we're gonna we're gonna be the house of
[1:18:31] God and if it's just me that's there I'm
[1:18:34] gonna worship God if it's only me I'm
[1:18:38] still gonna give God the glory that he
[1:18:40] deserves if I'm the only one left if I
[1:18:42] preach until there's nobody left here
[1:18:45] and I'm the only one left here I want to
[1:18:47] be one standing and say Lord you still
[1:18:49] deserve a preacher the lists for you you
[1:18:52] still deserve somebody to lift their
[1:18:54] hands in praise if our heart condemn us
[1:18:58] not we have confidence toward God say
[1:19:01] well my heart condemns me I don't want
[1:19:02] to know what to do about it make it
[1:19:04] right how long does that take it takes
[1:19:07] that long that's that's all there is to
[1:19:11] it but it's hard for us to believe that
[1:19:14] because we keep thinking well I'll make
[1:19:16] that mistake again
[1:19:17] make it right make it right and when we
[1:19:22] surrender to God we don't just surrender
[1:19:23] to God but we say God I know I can't
[1:19:26] surrender like a lot to help me to
[1:19:28] surrender in a way that would be
[1:19:30] pleasing to you and whatsoever we ask
[1:19:37] you have things that you need I know
[1:19:40] that I did whatsoever we ask well I've
[1:19:46] been asking a lot lately but he said
[1:19:48] whatever we ask hey Ben whatever we ask
[1:19:52] whatever we ask we receive of him are
[1:19:55] you with me tonight whatever we ask we
[1:19:57] receive of him because we keep his
[1:19:59] Commandments and do those things that
[1:20:01] are pleasing in his sight listen to me
[1:20:04] it's a miracle that we're here tonight
[1:20:05] it's a miracle
[1:20:07] the house of God it's a miracle you can
[1:20:09] I can take you back through my life and
[1:20:11] walk you through and say it's a miracle
[1:20:12] that I'm standing here preaching but for
[1:20:14] you today it's a miracle that you're
[1:20:16] sitting in the pew listening in on a
[1:20:18] Wednesday night
[1:20:18] it's a miracle in this day and age with
[1:20:20] all this went on that you're sitting
[1:20:22] here today this church is still
[1:20:24] operating like God wants it to today
[1:20:26] it's a miracle that it's happening and
[1:20:28] if he's done this we believe whatever we
[1:20:30] ask we receive of him hallelujah because
[1:20:36] we keep his Commandments and do those
[1:20:37] things that are pleasing in his sight
[1:20:39] and he goes on to say this is his
[1:20:40] commandment that we love one another we
[1:20:42] love him amen
[1:20:48] brother madam and watch this this quote
[1:20:52] but there's one quote but I've broken it
[1:20:56] up into three or four slides watch this
[1:20:58] before we close but the Branham says now
[1:21:02] Hebrews the first chapter said God in
[1:21:05] sundry times and divers manners spake to
[1:21:07] the fathers through the prophets but in
[1:21:10] this last day by his son Christ Jesus
[1:21:12] for the RAM said see it's the Holy
[1:21:15] Spirit taking over possession taking
[1:21:20] possession of the church to operate
[1:21:23] Christ in the church then you become as
[1:21:30] he was he became as you was so you could
[1:21:35] become as he was he become you that you
[1:21:40] might become him
[1:21:41] he said that it's above understanding I
[1:21:46] hope you with me I hope you get it
[1:21:49] because you can't understand that how
[1:21:51] could God come down and live through me
[1:21:54] because I make so many mistakes but look
[1:21:56] he becoming she was so you can become as
[1:21:58] he was he become you that you might
[1:22:00] become him that it's above understanding
[1:22:03] there's no way to explain it and don't
[1:22:05] try it
[1:22:06] just accept it he spoke it and that
[1:22:09] settles it just say it's right believe
[1:22:13] it there's some people who can just ruin
[1:22:17] any gift you give them because they
[1:22:20] always got
[1:22:21] no words from and how much it cost and
[1:22:23] and and all the parameters of it
[1:22:25] everything about it no just take it just
[1:22:30] take it I want you to have it
[1:22:33] you don't have to ask me how I got it if
[1:22:36] I could afford it or anything else just
[1:22:37] take it
[1:22:39] don't you see God doing that same thing
[1:22:41] to us just take it accept it don't know
[1:22:45] try to figure it out accept it he said
[1:22:48] he spoke it that settles it just say
[1:22:50] it's right believe it
[1:22:53] no brother and says as a young Christian
[1:22:55] I've always made this statement I was
[1:22:58] glad God got ahold of me before the
[1:23:00] church did hard telling what I had a
[1:23:03] been but I was faithful of the
[1:23:10] leadership and the direct contact but
[1:23:15] then we don't understand why we come up
[1:23:16] sometimes the way we do and have to go
[1:23:18] through things but if so we could get in
[1:23:19] direct contact with God he said it was
[1:23:24] the direct contact I was thankful for
[1:23:26] the leadership and the direct contact
[1:23:27] with the Holy Spirit impressed my life
[1:23:30] with before I ever surrendered it he
[1:23:33] said France a little lad I knew there
[1:23:35] was something he had talked and I talked
[1:23:38] to him he talked back to me and I began
[1:23:40] to notice that the thing said he told me
[1:23:42] us a little lad they begin to happening
[1:23:45] just exactly the way he said they do so
[1:23:48] I knew it had to be true so watch this
[1:23:50] God begins to move in a Prophet's life
[1:23:52] and he cost him when he's young as he's
[1:23:54] young to begin to grow up and come up in
[1:23:56] a different way he wasn't raised in a
[1:23:58] church home he wasn't raised like
[1:24:01] everybody else was but he'd come up in a
[1:24:03] special way and God got to him before
[1:24:05] the church did and God began to speak to
[1:24:08] him and as he spoke he saw it come to
[1:24:11] pass and when he did he knew it must be
[1:24:13] true what's he doing he's building
[1:24:16] confidence in him
[1:24:17] oh my you see because we're not just
[1:24:21] looking at Moses or in Abraham were at
[1:24:24] Paul who met God who followed God's Word
[1:24:29] who kept God's Word or who had
[1:24:32] confidence in who they were
[1:24:34] but we're looking at a prophet of God in
[1:24:36] our generation that meant God and it
[1:24:42] gives me confidence because I know it's
[1:24:44] not just a story from another time but
[1:24:46] it's something that happened when they
[1:24:47] had vehicles when they weenie had to put
[1:24:52] gas in his car like I do are you with me
[1:24:55] but now I think we can even open update
[1:24:57] it even further than that or we can say
[1:24:59] god I know it not only happened with him
[1:25:01] yes that gives me confidence that you're
[1:25:03] alive in this hour but it also gives me
[1:25:05] confidence to know that there's people
[1:25:07] who use the internet who still have the
[1:25:12] God working in their life are you with
[1:25:17] me now we believe we're at work we're
[1:25:19] the body of Christ then there's people
[1:25:21] who use the Internet people who use cell
[1:25:24] phones people who drive cars that almost
[1:25:26] drives themselves and for God can do
[1:25:30] that for them he can do it for me now
[1:25:34] brother Brent says I'm an old man now
[1:25:36] and I have never won time and can call
[1:25:40] the world to a standstill you talk about
[1:25:42] confidence and ask them put your finger
[1:25:46] on one thing that he ever told me in
[1:25:49] thus saith the Lord in the name of the
[1:25:51] Lord but what was absolutely the truth
[1:25:53] in fact it come to pass out of the
[1:25:56] thousands times thousands of things one
[1:26:00] thing what am I saying that for he said
[1:26:05] see I put us all this volcanic dust he
[1:26:08] said but it's the promise of God's Word
[1:26:10] therefore I cannot have confidence in
[1:26:13] myself
[1:26:15] wait a minute brother Ben I thought she
[1:26:17] said to have confidence on ourselves as
[1:26:19] children of God he said I cannot have
[1:26:23] confidence in myself you cannot have
[1:26:26] confidence in yourself but together we
[1:26:30] can have confidence in what has taken
[1:26:33] over ourselves better hallelujah we can
[1:26:41] have confidence in what has taken over
[1:26:43] ourselves we've been bought out there's
[1:26:46] a new administration
[1:26:48] there's new management you've been to a
[1:26:51] restaurant that was all beaten up and
[1:26:53] and broken now and everything didn't
[1:26:55] work and there Roach's going all over
[1:26:56] the place and maybe he said I'll never
[1:26:58] go back and you see a sign up says new
[1:27:00] management you sit then think well maybe
[1:27:02] I will go back why because if the
[1:27:05] management is different maybe they fix
[1:27:07] the broken places in the tables maybe
[1:27:09] they put in new floors maybe they hung
[1:27:11] better lights maybe they brought in some
[1:27:13] spray and sprayed the roaches so new
[1:27:18] management means something and you can
[1:27:20] say that about your life there's new
[1:27:21] management we don't have confidence in
[1:27:23] in ourselves - as far as the flesh we
[1:27:25] have confidence in what has taken over
[1:27:27] ourselves the Holy Spirit is taking us
[1:27:30] over he said we must have confidence in
[1:27:34] that and as we place our confidence in
[1:27:37] that then the results comes aren't you
[1:27:42] glad you could have confidence in
[1:27:44] something that has results god bless you
[1:27:49] musicians if you had come let's stand
[1:27:51] together bow our heads let's talk to the
[1:27:59] Lord for a moment maybe we could play
[1:28:08] that he became me that I might become
[1:28:10] him by grace you believe that you're
[1:28:15] becoming him by grace amen amen I I
[1:28:20] can't think of a greater thing than for
[1:28:24] him to take over my life
[1:28:27] I can't think of a greater thing for him
[1:28:31] you know I appreciate these brothers
[1:28:33] I've been having Talent take over
[1:28:35] theater service cuz I don't how much
[1:28:36] voice lived to be able to sing it I'm so
[1:28:41] grateful when someone with a voice comes
[1:28:43] and takes over but you know God wants to
[1:28:46] do that in your life somebody with a
[1:28:49] voice somebody with a with them with the
[1:28:51] ability to live it he wants to come in
[1:28:53] he wants to take over won't you let him
[1:28:55] today he said but another man I'll let
[1:28:57] him do that a long time ago would you
[1:28:59] just allow that influence of that word
[1:29:01] to be increased in your life if you
[1:29:04] don't have confidence in the word go and
[1:29:06] meet God made him hate him for real and
[1:29:10] then begin to obey his word he said well
[1:29:13] I had a sensation
[1:29:15] I felt something but but meet him and
[1:29:17] then begin to follow the word and as you
[1:29:19] begin to follow the word you'll see God
[1:29:21] moves in your life I promise you there's
[1:29:23] not many things I could promise you in
[1:29:25] this life but I'll promise you that if
[1:29:27] you meet God God will keep his word in
[1:29:30] your life he said for the better how do
[1:29:33] you know that because I know he's done
[1:29:35] it for me and he's done it for me and I
[1:29:38] should have left Church and every reason
[1:29:40] to quit the message and every reason not
[1:29:42] to be here today but I'm standing here
[1:29:44] as a testimony to what God can do when
[1:29:47] he takes over a life and you're here
[1:29:48] today because God takes over your life
[1:29:51] would you just let him do that tonight
[1:29:52] worship Him together

[1:30:20] confidence in you nor do you look like
[1:30:23] Abraham and it doesn't matter what
[1:30:24] happens doesn't matter whether the world
[1:30:27] goes crazy and has but hard they believe
[1:30:31] if everybody else is laughing at them
[1:30:33] they just keep building on the boat
[1:30:35] they just keep working they just keep
[1:30:37] knew and they just keep believing
[1:30:39] somebody gets sick somebody gets hurt
[1:30:41] somebody somebody leaves mess if
[1:30:43] somebody doesn't do right
[1:30:45] they just keep believing because there's
[1:30:47] something in all this build the
[1:30:48] confidence not just because God did it
[1:30:52] for Abraham or God did it for Moses God
