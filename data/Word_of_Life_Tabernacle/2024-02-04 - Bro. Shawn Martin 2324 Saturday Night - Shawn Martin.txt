the people have washed your feet father now if you would just speak to us father for all that's matters Lord as you just speak the word we ask it father in Jesus Christ's name we pray and the church says amen amen well I tell you what brother Ben says that my brother Wendell set a high bar amen and I told him I said well man come always coming after my brother both my brothers amen it makes a guy a little nervous but uh uh uh we're just going to preach the word of God Amen the book of Deuteronomy the uh seventh chapter and we're going to start at the sixth verse but it says for thou art an holy people unto the Lord thy God the Lord uh thy God hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself above all people that are upon the face of the Earth the Lord did not set his love upon you nor choose you because you were more in number than any people for you were the fewest of all people but because the Lord loved you and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers ha the Lord brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you out of the house of bondmen from the hand of pharaoh the king of Egypt Egypt know therefore that the Lord thy God he is God the faithful God can you say that he is God the faithful God which keepeth Covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his Commandments to a thousand Generations bless the name of the Lord you can have your seats this evening amen and we if I uh have a title I'm just going to title it he is the faithful God how many believes that he is faithful amen if you've experience God in any length of time through your lifetime you know that God is faithful amen now we know that we're living in a a a time it's the darkest of all ages and as the Bible has said that the darkness has covered the Earth gross Darkness the people and we're living in that day and and we realize uh through the message of the hour just how powerful this darkness is and how that darkness is deforming the people of the earth they uh uh and and and uh changing them uh from from a bad condition if we could say it that way to a worse condition amen and that's that's the power of darkness and it has caused a a a perversion and brother brandham touches this uh in in the message Shalom and he he talks about how that man doesn't seem to have that masculine touch that he used to have and woman doesn't seem to have that feminine touch that she used to have and he says you take man today men don't seem to be Burly like they used to be and it's all uh some sort of he says they want to wear suede shoes with purple and they want to act like women and he said now that is true and and he says it seems to be more or less like a perversion a woman wants to cut her hair off and and uh uh act like a man and man wants to act like a woman and he said yet you can talk to them and they're nice people to talk to nice people friendly socialable people but what's caused this he said it's that gross Darkness upon the people it's it's something that is pressed in to them ain't that right amen we uh he says the world is one of the most chaotic times of Darkness that it's ever stood in and yet it's standing in again the Most Blessed light that ever did Shine in aren't you glad for that amen so there's a people that is part of the gross darkness and then there's a people that's that is part of the light that is shining in and and so it's it's it's the the most evil time for some and it's the greatest time for others we know that the prophet said that the lid from hell has been lifted off of hell and demons are pouring in in every way in the nations in politics in the home in the churches demonology is is like never before ain't that right but brother bradam would say but now to you predestinated seed Shalom and that word shalom means peace ain't that right Shalom God's peace rest upon you because we're near the end now how many believes that we're near the end and he says now we're looking we are looking well who's that we well it's the elect of God it's that predestinated amen and he says we're looking forward to the breaking of a new day how many's looking forward to that that breaking of a new day we're we're looking forward to the breaking of a new day until there's something great that's laying ahead of us where the years has been Joy that we've looked forward to the pressing the coming of the great light so this darkness is pressing Upon A people but the light is pressing as well upon the predestinated and and and now that that the wrath of God is coming up upon this world and and tribulation is setting in and people are losing their Minds yet there is a people that is standing under Shalom amen looking for a great day ahead amen yes sir so he says see he says now we can we can see the coming of this great light and the breaking Over the Horizon uh the hor horizonal uh uh Rim it's breaking between Mortal and immortality we see it breaking between the heavens and earth from an earth round sickness and troubled world into a bright shining day of immortal life and an immortal body and Immortal Earth that shall never pass away can you say Amen so the prophet would say shalom shalom to you little bride amen because this light is breaking all power of Darkness away from you can you say Amen you're not just uh uh uh exist in amen and the light and darkness affecting you but once light comes Darkness has to flee can you say amen amen so a prophet could stand in the most evil age and the most perverted age and cry out peace peace to this elect can you say Amen now all we can say about it is God is faithful amen the scripture tells us that God is alone exec uh uh Exodus 9:14 God said there is none like me in all of the earth uh Psalms 8610 says Thou Art God Alone Now the Bible teaches us that there's none greater than God Amen there's nothing nothing equal to God Amen God is all alone Isaiah 40 and 25 God says to whom then will you liken me or who shall I be equal saith the Holy One ain't that right see when we look at God we look at him far above amen separate from any anything of this Earth seen unseen God is God alone amen and he's faithful and that word faithful means loyal unwavering steadfast devoted dedicated can you say Amen so God is devoted he's a he's not God that just speaks something amen and just uh uh leaves it be but but he's devoted to that amen he's devoted to his creation he's he's devoted to his plan he's he's dedicated to his purpose aren't you glad for that God is faithful so he is steadfast and and and so if if he's faithful then there's no weakness in God Amen and for he is divine do you believe he's Divine and all that he is is divine so his his nature is divine his love is divine it's not just love it's divine love it's it's not just faithfulness it's divine faithfulness amen it's not just peace it's divine peace can you sayen it's something that cannot be attained by Humanity amen I don't care of all the achievements that man has amen you can never man can never achieve Divine amen man can come up with peace a for a temporary maybe take a vacation or maybe he may he lives in a time where there's no war and and there's peace and and maybe he's peace where because uh he's he's got money in the bank and he's got a fancy car he's got nice everything is going well amen but that kind of a pieace will never be a Divine peace amen we can be faithful to our wife we can be faithful to the job we can be faithful to the church we can be faithful Amen to to our uh whatever to our own little old plan but when it comes to God amen it's a Divine faithfulness that man will ever never ever know can you say Amen see so we find that whatever man has there's a weakness in man man can be faithful to a certain extent but then he breaks how many times we see marriages fall apart that have been together for 50 years and all of a sudden amen uh uh the wife wants to go or the man wants to go amen and what faithfulness there was now we see there there's a weakness in that kind of a faithfulness but there's no weakness with God when we say that God is faithful amen he will he'll forever endure his love will forever be amen his purpose for you will will never ever change God is faithful can you say Amen you see Divine is far beyond human comprehension human ways human thoughts human nature so this is why God would say my way are higher than your ways my thoughts are higher than your thoughts and we could even say that God would tell us my faithfulness is higher than your faithfulness my love is higher than your love amen whatever I am is far purer than what you could ever thing amen that's the god that we serve amen see so we find that it is in absolutely impossible for man to be what God is within himself see it's in God's nature to be faithful aren't you glad for that it's just in his nature no one forces him to be faithful to you it's just God it's in his nature to be faithful to you amen it's in God's nature amen but again his faithfulness is far superior to the faithfulness of man amen now the position that god holds allows him to be faithful see because he is sovereign aren't you glad he's Sovereign amen I looked up sovereignty and it has to do with kingship or the supremacy of God Amen in other words he's Sovereign he's not bound to anything he's Sovereign amen that puts him above your trial that puts him above your thoughts that puts him higher than your purpose that puts him more in control than what you are in control of yourself he has the ability to turn the situation around when your back is is against the wall God is Sovereign he can step in any time and take care of your situation can you say Amen that allows him to be faithful amen he's not in Checkmate your sin doesn't put him in Checkmate your troubles doesn't put him in checkm God is faithful because he is Sovereign ain't that right first Chronicles 29:11 thine O Lord is the greatness and the power and the glory and the Victory and the Majesty for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is thine thine is the kingdom oh Lord and thou art exalted as head above all Daniel 4:35 all the inhabitants of the Earth are reputed as nothing he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven and among the inhabitant of the earth and none everybody say none none can stay his hand or say unto him what doest thou amen Psalms 115 and3 breaking in our God is in the heaven and he hath done whatsoever he ha pleased he Sovereign oh my amen see and so therefore he is free to do as he pleases when he pleases how he pleases and there's nothing that can stop him oh aren't you glad for that amen your own nature couldn't stop him your own Rebellion couldn't stop him you running away from him couldn't stop him amen your own will couldn't stop him your plans could not stop him everything about you was contrary to what he desired of you but yet it couldn't stop him he Sovereign and he's faithful yes sir Ephesians 1:11 tells us that he worketh all things after the counsel of his own will thank you Lord Colossians 1:16 for by him were all things created that are in Earth and that are uh in heaven that are in Earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or Powers all things were created by Him and for him aren't you glad for that amen that he did didn't just create something amen and then leave it to another to another being he didn't create you young man and then leave you to another uh uh uh to the power of Darkness uh but you were created by Him and you were created for him can you say Amen aren't you glad for that amen I'm so glad that he didn't just create us and then leave us Amen to to the world and leave us to the devil and and leave us you see God has the power power and he's been directing us all through our lives and you may have not understood it but God knows what he's doing can you say amen and your life may seem a wreck and you may have scars but that same God has the ability Amen to take your life and bring it back together and take every scar away from you for God is [Applause] faithful there is no one who can bring a legal dispute of his actions and bring a judgment against him to restrict him from carrying out his plan he is Sovereign in his creation he is Sovereign in his Works he is Sovereign in his choosing he is Sovereign in his word and his word is promises do you believe that so because God is Sovereign then he took the liberty Amen to write our names in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world and he didn't have to ask you he didn't have to get your enemy's permission to do so he didn't have to ask the devil amen if he could do that he's Sovereign amen so he takes the Liberty by himself and he writes our names in the Lamb's Book of Life can you say amen amen he took the liberty to choose to predestinate amen and even to glorify us uh amen before you even took your first breath amen now we can't even understand that kind of sovereignty but God is Sovereign can you say amen amen so then then we find that this was not just God expressing his wishes and desires for our life amen so he writes say our names in the Lamb's Book of Life as an expression of his wish for us us no no no no this is his command for us this is his Destiny for us can you say amen amen he knew exactly what he was doing when he wrote your name in the Lamb's Book of Life he knew he already knew what the devil would do with you he knew the trials that you would go through but he wrote your name in the Lamb's Book of Life and because he is faithful amen he can already set your end uh amen he's already predestinated an end for this church can you say Amen he's already done it amen see so it is his decree it is his decree that we should be not his wish that we would be but his decree that we should be can you say Amen now in the the message uh Christ is the mystery of God revealed Amen brother brandom talks about the three-fold purpose that God had first to reveal himself in Christ amen which was the fullness of the godhead bodily amen poured into Christ ain't that right amen secondly to bring that fullness of the godhead bodily into a people that he could have the preeminence the oversight and the leading amen but it doesn't just stop there amen the third is to restore the kingdom to its rightly POS position that failed by sin by the first Adam back to where he walked in the cool of the Eden with his people talked with him and fellowshipped with him can you say Amen you see that's why we talk about a millennium that's why we talk about a new Heaven and a new Earth because that is part of God's plan for us can you say amen that's why amen God would never save you fill you with the Holy Ghost and let this gross Darkness come upon your life only to obliviate everything that he done oh no no no God's got a purpose for you amen and he's told us not that he only just call us and not only did he save us but he's already got a place prepared for us I say God is [Applause] faithful now as brother Andrew read last night God intended this church to be a powerful church do you believe it well we just might as well say it and the devil ain't going to stop it he's tried for years in this area to break that thing to keep us from being a powerful Church he's tried for years to keep us from being united he's tried for years to break our backs to destroy our faith he's tried for years to destroy our peace he's tried for years to shake us from this message he's tried for years to shake us from the promises of God but he can't do it he can't do it how many still got their faith intact he can't do it there is nothing too hard there's nothing that the devil can put upon you to break you God is [Applause] faithful God is faithful God intended this church to be a powerful Church a glorious church I'm going to tell you church and young people amen you might hear one arguing and one fighting and fussing and and you might hear even preachers sometimes getting into arguments and and using their pulpits for Amen to to blast another man and blast another pastor and all these things but that's not what God intended amen can you say Amen oh my I appreciated the message last night amen but he says see he said God now intended this church to be a powerful Church a glorious Church Church a church that the whole world uh or we'll even just put it Hardy Arkansas amen can look amen and wherever your is and and your church and wherever your church and amen and wherever you're going to God intended for you to be a powerful church that your community can look and see a living God in that can you say Amen yes sir that the whole world could look upon a bride of Christ uh well accept accepted and espouse and to live in such an atmosphere and conduct itself in such a way that God would be proud of this church to present it to Christ at the coming of the Lord it he says it should live in that characteristics in the church and it should be living that way well I want to just be honest with you I believe there's ministers in this building tonight that God is proud of Amen when he sees that you're trying to get Fellowship together together among the people God must be proud of that amen when he see that you're standing here amen and you're not using a Pulpit for self gain and you're just staying true to the message of the hour God must be proud and he looks at you parents and you're standing faithful and you're preaching this message to your children you're staying dedicated to this message God must be proud when he looks at you young people amen and you're not out in the world and you're not indulging in the things this world but you're stand true to God in spite of everything that you go through he must be proud God promised that he was going to have a bride without spot or wrinkle or blemish you believe that you know and she's going to be there and let's just say it there ain't no guessing game with God come on the world is shaken but God ain't the church is shaken but God ain't politics is shaken but God ain't the Bible says the foundation of the Lord stand assure having this seal the Lord knoweth him that are [Applause] his amen amen amen you see he not only knows your name he's more intimate with you than you could ever imagine yes sir she going to be there God is faithful you see he is faithful because he's Eternal ain't that right he's Eternal now Eternal means having having an infinite duration continued without intermission God ain't going to take a break on your life your life can't get so bad that God takes a break from you I understand that it seems like some have you ever just had it where you prayed and just seemed like God ain't there you've gone through season in your life and it seemed like God just has given up on you now I'm going to be honest preachers have that too preachers go through times that we just want sometimes your pastor gets up here by faith and he's preaching not because he feeling God to do it he's got faith in God to do it you know he's just going by faith well we pray by faith we worship by faith amen and it seems like God has taken a break but God is infinite he's Eternal he can't take a break you understand there ain't no time out with you all right all right there might be time out with you and your child but there ain't no timeout with God he'll put up with you any day do you realize God is willing to put up with you come on do you realize that you'll never be able to get God's wrath upon you come on now church he may correct you but he'll never pour His you'll never know the wrath of God can you say amen amen now the world's got the wrath of God poured upon them but you'll never know the wrath of God Amen because God's got you for himself he loved you not because you were many a number but because he chose you he loved you he loves you he loves you he loves you young people he loves you don't you let the devil tell you that God is against you don't you let the devil say Amen that God is done with you God is eternal and because he is eternal he is faithful [Applause] he's faithful in his love he's faithful in his Joy he's faithful in his peace he's faithful in his plan for his plan is eternal his love is eternal his faithfulness is eternal so if God is eternal he can't change contined without intermission endless Timeless existing at all times now we we can believe that God exists at all times but what about his love so God love so Lov it's all right that exists but now what about his love to us now then we played the game he loves me he loves me not he loves me he loves me not he loves me when I'm doing good but what about when you fall does he still love you he's Eternal good pre come on come on see existing at all times without beginning and without ending God never had a beginning and God will never have an ending well everything about God will never have a a beginning his love towards you never had a beginning and it'll never have a ending come on church it's just the facts either God loves you or he don't but if you've ever felt the love of God one little inkling of a Time amen that's enough Amen to last you for eternity amen God would never show his love to you only to turn his back from you can you say Amen all through the scriptures you'll find that God was always seeking for reconciliation God was always providing a way to bring you back can you say Amen because he is eternal and he cannot [Music] [Applause] change so God always was and always will be then everything that comes from him is eternal his thoughts are Eternal his word which comes out of his mouth is eternal can you say Amen his faith his love his strength his peace his Joy everything his ways amen see an eternal God cannot lie can you say that with me God cannot lie God cannot lie say it like you mean it now God cannot lie don't say that while you're looking at your trial get your trials out of the way get your feelings out of the way amen get the droughts out of the way get everything out of the way and just say God cannot lie God cannot lie God cannot lie I don't care how bad you feel God cannot lie I don't care how in a drought you are in God cannot lie I don't know how scarred up you really are that God cannot lie can you say Amen you may be at the lowest step of your life that God cannot lie he's Eternal so his eternal thoughts cannot lie his Eternal Word cannot lie his eternal plan and purpose cannot lie his eternal love Eternal Joy cannot lie can you say Amen so therefore he cannot be faithful in one thing of your life amen and not faithful in another thing can you say Amen yes sir see amen he cannot be faithful in the saving of the soul and not faithful in the healing of your body that's why we can believe him if you can believe God to save your soul then you can believe God to heal your body if you can believe God to heal your body you can believe God Amen to save your lost loved ones if you can believe God to save your lost Lov you can believe God to change this v body God cannot he's [Applause] faithful well can you lift your hands and Worship the Lord God is faithful he's faithful to his [Applause] word he cannot love you today and hate you tomorrow he cannot have a place prepared for you today only to turn you down tomorrow can you say Amen in John 14 and two Jesus said I go to prepare a place for you and if I go to prepare a place for you I will come [Applause] again and receive you unto myself that where I am you may be there also he's not building a place separate from him amen he wants you to be with him and that's the whole point of repairing the place is that you can be with him and dwell not temporarily but for eternity how many's looking for that light is pressing on we've got something that's looking ahead something darkness is covering the world but God is faithful you see I go to prepare a place for you if he said you then that means you don't put it off for somebody else look in the mirror and say that's me me well this me this is the mirror this is the mirror can you see yourself in the mirror can you say mama that's me he's prepared me a [Music] place then that's why the prophet said no one can take your place that's right you believe it no one because God is faithful he's Eternal he cannot lie see James 1:17 there is no variableness come on in other words there's no changing neither shadow of turning with the Father of Lights in other words with the one who gives light can you say man amen he's the one that brought the light Rise and Shine for thy light has come well where do the light come from the father have sent the light and in him there is no Shadow there's a reason there is a purpose for him to shine the light in you brother Vernon you're shining you're walking in the light and there's a reason that God called you there's a reason that you're walking in the light and not in Gross Darkness he went to prepare a place for you and if I come again I'm going to come again and receive you I I just you just have to excuse me but I believe that's what Revelations 10:1 is all about the mighty angel coming down and it's the magnet as brother brand talked about that magnet sweeping amen and all them little particles coming he's Sweeping in this age and he's drawing us he's pulling us and there ain't no Darkness for you there's light there's a millennium for you there's a heaven for you there's a new Earth for you where there ain't going to be no Sor there's no disappointment there's no heartache oh thy light has come because God God is faithful sir brother brah said God has never had a new thought about anything because all of his thoughts he has always had and always will have and knows the end from the beginning because he's God thus the thoughts of God are Eternal and they are real they're not simply like a man with a blueprint he is drawn up which one day will be translated into substance and form but they are already real and eternal and part of God can you say Amen in Isaiah 5511 God says the word that goes forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it can you say Amen Jesus said heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never pass away ain't that right so here in Hebrews 10 and 23 Paul tells us let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promise can you say Amen see he made the promise amen and he's faithful to that promise amen see so therefore now we looking at that promise are required to hold fast amen hold fast our confession that word profession means confession ain't that right and and without wavering notice let hold fast keep secure grab and hold tight amen the profession or confession of our faith without wavering now we're required to be faithful your confession must be faithful don't you let it waver in and out amen don't you let it be well he loves me today he I don't know about tomorrow I don't know this I believe God is for me but now I don't know I believe I'm going in a Rapture today day you know we feel all good and then when the when when the Trials come we just don't know God help us not to let our our confession of Faith [Applause] waver well why shouldn't it waver for he is faithful that promised can you say Amen you see he made the promise so for us to see his faithfulness we must know what he promised you see because God is Not faithful to a man's word he isn't faithful to negative thoughts that we entertain he isn't faithful to our discouragement and our unbelief I'm going to be honest he isn't faithful to your sins either he's not faithful to your mistakes and your your failures and he's not even faithful to your sickness and my sickness can you say man we have our ups and downs constantly amen we we we're just living in a in in a human body amen that is sub subject to all kinds of things amen but God's not even faithful to that he's faithful to his word concerning you Hallelujah can you say Amen see so then when we start looking outside of what he promised then we lose the sight of the reality of his faithfulness if you look at what other people think of you instead of looking what God says about you then you're going to lose the reality of God's faithfulness because what they say about you God is not obligated to what they think about you God's not obligated to can you say Amen what do you say about yourself God's not obligated to he's obligated to his word is this all right obligated to his word amen see so you know did did did did God call us only to forget about us on did he save us only to lose us did he show his love to us only to turn us away come on Church did he commission us only to condemn us at the end you know brother BR said someone someone asked him said brother Bram aren't you afraid to make such statements as that he said no sir I've stood before tens of thousands critics sitting everywhere and I've never seen a time but what God has always brought the Deliverance he said I've seen critics come a hypnotizer once was going to come to hypnotize yep and and he says the man's paralyzed yet tonight that's right said you child of the devil why would you why do you try to deceive God one come to the platform one time making out something a minister of a certain Church his sins were called out and he fell on the platform see we're not living in the days of playing Church we're living in the days when Christ is making himself manifest to his church to prove through his word that he might be fulfilled amen the things that I do shall you do also God not playing games God didn't play games when he sent this prophet he didn't play games when he opened the Lamb's Book of Life he ain't playing games when brother Brown said this is redemption claims oh yeah can you say Amen God's serious about this thing that's right the devil ain't playing games either he's trying to take you out he's trying to destroy you this is a real battle here are you with me [Music] now brother job 23 and13 he is in one mind and who can turn him and what his so desireth even he doeth for he performthe for me and many such things are with him so brother brandham said see although I if I'm trying and I fail God won't leave me oh yeah can you sayen he says I'm I don't have much confidence in anybody that's too afraid to do anything I'd rather be found a failure than too lazy to [Applause] try thank God for you pastors that ain't too lazy to try God ain't going to let it fail God ain't going to let let this Bond of Fellowship fail come on church God ain't going to let your faith fail God ain't going to let your confession fail keep trying you say well I fail get back up are you with me now good good preach God is faithful not not only to speak his word but he's faithful to believe his own word do you believe it so therefore let's hold fast the confession our faith without wavering without fluctuating in opinion in Allegiance or Direction that's right don't don't don't don't let your faith fail can you sayen in opinion of God come on what's your opinion of God come on come on he's mighty what about your when your valleys now don't let that opinion fluctuate be faithful to him can you say Amen when everything falls apart and all hell breaks loose don't let your confession of Faith waver in your opinion of God in your opinion of his word his word will come to pass I don't know when I don't know how I don't know where but it will come to pass he's faith I hope this is was helping he's faithful you realize he'll move mountains to show that he's faithful to his word he moved the Red Sea one time because to show he's faithful he entered into a a fiery furnace one time to prove that he's faithful he went into a lions then to shut that mouth them Lion's mouths to prove he's faithful say Amen you realize when Christ walked the Earth he came to fulfill the word of God what was he he was God's Masterpiece I'm getting somewhere we're going to hurry up amen but see the prophet said when God made his first Masterpiece Adam he put him behind the word ain't that right but here he made another Masterpiece which was Jesus Christ and he didn't put him behind the word he was the word can you say amen God was showing himself as a faithful God that he made him not just put him behind the word this masterpiece would be the word yes sir Adam was the was the type Christ was the Fulfillment can you say Amen what was Christ the son of man made flesh the word made flesh son of man everybody say son of man the word made flesh amen the word made flesh amen what word every word that the prophet spoke of of Messiah Christ was it can you say Amen every type and every shadow of the Lamb the sacrifice the priest and the Altar and the Tabernacle and all Christ was it he fulfilled it he was the word made Flesh on can you say Amen so what God had in his mind concerning Redemption Christ fulfilled it not just putting behind the word he was the word amen and what is redemption is to bring back to its original condition that which has fallen ain't that right so therefore Christ fulfilled every word of God that was spoken of him to do it but he didn't do it alone everybody say it with me he didn't do it alone he was human but he didn't do it alone he was a man but he didn't do it alone can you say amen for the Bible says it was God the faithful God that was in Christ in iling the world unto himself ain't that right another place it says the fullness of the godhead bodily dwelt in him ain't that right so therefore Jesus was the tabernacle or the body of God Amen that God dwelt in so God thought of himself as bridegroom can you say amen and in that body he fulfilled that God thought of himself being tangible and there he was in Christ for Jesus says he that has seen the father or has seen me has seen the father can you say amen amen for the father dwelleth in me see it's the only way that God could be a redeemer was to become human ain't that right so then he become Redeemer but why did he become Redeemer to redeem that which was Fallen can you say man so in other words the plan did or the story his purpose did not stop with Jesus Christ the 2,000 years ago he was making a way to fulfill his plan he was making a way through Christ amen to fulfill his plan can you say amen he knew you was coming brother he's faithful can you say Amen so we we find you know the prophet talked a lot about the Samaritan woman and he said is in the fall you know this woman got all messed up but God had her in his thinking before the foundation of the world and he come to cleanse her ain't that right so here in Hebrews 2:17 wherefore in all things it behooved him to be made like unto his Brethren that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest aren't you glad you got a faithful high priest he's a merciful high priest but he's a faithful high priest his Mercy will never fail are you with me now amen and you know what a high priest is for is to make intercession thank every time you make a mistake there's an intercessor is it truth yeah he's a faithful high priest in other words how can you fail how can you lose he's a faithful [Applause] God he went to back for you before you even breathe your first breath and then he finish it before you finish your breathe your first breath hallu we question if we're going to make it but God don't question he knows his own faithfulness he knows he can't fail it ain't about you it's about [Applause] him that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God to make reconciliation for the sins of the people now brother brand said the predestinated is the only one that's considered in Redemption people might be making like and think they are but the real Redemption is those that are predestinated and and and and and then what does the Bible say we've been loosed he watched us or loosed us with his own blood he didn't leave it to an angel he didn't leave it to a natural lamb some old animal he himself came to be your Redeemer he himself created his own blood because he has the ability to do such he's sovereign he didn't have to go get dirt or whatever to make himself blood he created that blood to redeem you redeem you can you say man if he wasn't serious about you he could have just played games with you and let you go all your life offering up some animal go all your life shaking a preacher's hand go all your life just being religious go all your life just saying God sent a prophet but that's ain't what God's all about he's faithful he wanted to secure you he wanted to take you to where the devil had no right on you so he created his own blood and he redeemed you and then he loosed you how many's loosed you're loosed and the prophet said if it's a perfect blood that is loosed you then that loosening is perfect and complete then the devil has no legal rights over you say that with me devil you have no legal right over me you have no legal right over my home you have no legal right over my children you have no legal right over my church you have no legal right over my people can you say Amen it's a perfect loosening Hebrews 10:14 for by one offering everybody say by one offering not millions of offerings come on he's not Catholic by one offering Heath perfected once and for allall can you say Amen them that are Sanctified can you say amen and he's the faithful high priest he gave you the Holy Ghost he sealed you up and now you're still living in a body that's going to be a thorn in you come on can you say Amen this old body's carnal this old body's you know it's got full of mistakes it's it's it's yeah man I don't know if you have to live with yourself or not but I have to live with myself a lot you understand what I'm saying amen but one thing about it by one offering he hath perfected once and for [Applause] all and then he becomes a faithful high priest he gave you the Holy Ghost but just because you have the Holy Ghost don't mean you don't need a high [Applause] priest brother Brandon said we fail we backslide every day we don't mean to but we do we sin he said Christians sin on we don't mean to and the moment we realize we do it we say God forgive me and guess what you don't have to beat yourself up you don't have to let the devil destroy your life you don't have to let the devil put condemnation in you you got a faithful high priest a faithful high priest a faithful high priest he didn't make you an angel when he gave you the Holy Ghost he made you a [Applause] son right in this old body of Temptation right in this old body of weakness right in this old body of failures right in this old body of sickness and pain amen but yet he made you a Son of God and he is faithful to his own [Applause] word so he's a faithful high priest who Faithfully everybody say Faithfully Faithfully maketh intercession for you and them intercessions are faithful amen now Hebrews 7:24 this man because he continu ever hath an unchangeable priesthood wherefore he is able to save also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them can you say Amen now notice now but according to Hebrews 3:1 he is the high priest of our profession confession can you say amen amen he's the faith ful high priest of our confession brother Braham said see he's the high priest of our confession then he cannot do one thing for you cannot make any intercession until you can first confess it that it's done right can you say amen he said now is that scripture see high priest of our confession then he can only act when we confess ain't that right now I want to just say it there is no human being on the face of the Earth that has ever lived and will live and living right now that can ever accuse God of not being faithful that's right amen you see for when a man comes God's provided way he will see him in his faithfulness is this okay when a man comes God's provided way now God's faithful to provide the way and when a man comes according to that provided way he will see God in his faithfulness ain't that right you see first John 1:9 if everybody say if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive our sins you see why the devil tries to keep us from repenting until you repent you'll never see him in his faithfulness but when you repent he's faithful he's just to forgive us of all of our sins don't don't just don't measure sins with god well you know I stole piece of bubble gum but he yeah he slapped someone don't don't go start measuring sins he's faithful and just to forgive all sins come on Church he's faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all everybody say all unrighteousness you see God was faithful to provide the ark he was going to send judgment he it it was happening he he was going to send wrath he was going to destroy the world but God was faithful to that elect and he provided an ark of of Escape ain't that right amen see and then there was that elect that were faithful to believe what God sent unto them God sent them a prophet with a message and there was the elect that was faithful to that message ain't that right and when it was time to get into the ark they got into the ark and you know what God was faithful to that elect he made sure that that elect got to the other world can you say man that art couldn't that art couldn't float on its own ability come on now but God was faithful to them they were faithful to this message they were faithful to follow that message and God was faithful to them God wouldn't let that flood destroy them God wouldn't let them that that them waves and the turbulence and all of that s that Ark God was faithful and he brought them on the other side thank you Lord just before the death angel went throughout the land of Egypt to slay the firstborn God provided a token remember he told him you know the this Blood the blood shall be for a token unto you amen and when I see the blood I will pass over so over you so so the prophet amen God told the people what to do that they had to apply the token amen over over the house ain't that right amen see so they had to be faithful in applying the token they had to be faithful in what they were doing there see but then they got inside that house under the blood and they didn't have to worry they didn't have to fear they didn't they weren't popping nerve pills look at the world today anxiety is taking over the world today men's hearts are failing them for fear after looking other the things that are coming upon the Earth ain't that right but a Believer amen that's under the token you don't have to worry about that God was faithful to give you a provided way and if you faithful to keep that token over you God will be faithful he will pass over you and not one part of death will ever come to you spiritual death ain't going to strike your soul spiritual death is striking the world today yeah churches are without Revival spiritual enlightenment churches just people don't have that anymore can you say Amen but there is a bride's Revival and you know where that's happening under a token can you say Amen see so so you know the prophet said they didn't have to do anything under under that token they just rest in God's provided way and you know what the prophet said he said for them to be scared would be an insult to Jehovah see God provided the token he told them what to do and they're faithful to do that and then under that token they're shaken they're scared they don't know what to do I just don't know it would have been an insult to Jehovah you know the prophet says that people are afraid today because they're afraid that God won't keep his word can you say Amen but you realize if God provides something to us and we don't trust him to be faithful in that that's an insult to [Music] him can you say Amen brother Ram said if if a man once under the blood feels afraid that God won't keep his word it's an insult to him you say well Jehovah perhaps this is your word but I don't know whether it's right or not oh shame on you why once under the blood he said I'm the Lord that Health Thee I believe it that's all don't insult him don't insult him I say to you you you ministers that's why we must keep the promises over the people keep the promises over the people don't care about what that church does or don't care what this one does or what this one does keep the promise over the people that they can see his faithfulness in his word preach the message will you allow me just a few more moments that's the Bible talks about a faithful people Moses was faithful in all his house Abraham is called faithful Abraham Peter in his writings mentioned a man named Sylvanas and called him a faithful brother there are several men who Paul mentions in his writings calling them faithful brothers or faithful ministers Paul even speaking of himself said that he was counted faithful of the Lord and was put into the ministry then he tells P Timothy this young Pastor he says the word that you've heard of me commit thou unto Faithful Men commit the word to Faithful Men ain't that right Paul's letter to the colossian church was addressed to the Saints and the faithful brethren in Christ his letter to the Ephesian church was addressed to the Saints which are at Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus brother brandham said it was addressed to the called Chosen and faithful in Christ Jesus ain't that right well according to The Parables that Jesus gives in the New Testament we find that at the End of Time amen when it's all said and done there is going to be a group of people that he's going to welcome in and say Well done thy good and faithful servant enter into the joys of the Lord oh you to think of that now faithfulness means something to God in this time of shifting sand in this time of of change in this time of ups and downs see there's an eternal quality that's been reflected in the people and one of them qualities is faithfulness faithfulness amen God will send you through trials amen but what he wants out of you is faithfulness can you say amen he may allow you to go through sickness but what he wants out of you is a faithfulness in his word a faithful confession amen he will allow you Amen to go without feeling him and feeling like you're backslid and even allow the devil to tell you you've lost you've crossed the line there's no more hope of Mercy for you but what God really wants of you is a faithfulness a faithfulness can you say Amen don't worry about the battles you're going to make it amen don't worry about failure you're going to make it but what God wants is faithfulness you see the elect is going to have the Divine attribute of faithfulness that's why I gave you the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost just isn't a sensation the Pentecostal has made the Holy Ghost sensation but we heard last night you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost comes upon you and that power is Authority that's right so notice now Revelation 17:14 these shall make war with the lamb and the lamb shall overcome them for he is the Lord of lords and king of kings and they that are with Him identified with him are called and chosen and faithful can you say Amen called Chosen and faithful ain't that right amen see called of God chosen of God faithful to God ain't that right so then how can there be faithfulness How can there be faith faithfulness in man alone what man can produce such faithfulness that God is looking for amen well you know here Isaiah 40 and6 says all flesh is as grass all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field the grass withereth the flower fadeth because the spirit of the Lord bloweth upon it surely the people is grass the grass Werth the flower fadeth so you ain't going to find no faithfulness in man alone but the word of the Lord Our God Amen shall stand forever ain't that right look through the history of mankind amen and see where there is such an a stability in humanity there's not anytime you look to man you're going to f you're going to be disappointed you believe that I know I know it's a shock anytime you look to a preacher you're going to be disappointed that's right on and anytime the preacher looks to his congregation he's going to be disappointed that's right come on now we don't want to be a disappointed Church you don't want a pastor that's disappointed and he don't want a congregation that's disappointed so we're not going to look at one another and I want to just say it to you now anytime you look to yourself you're going to be disappointed brag about yourself all you want to you're going to be [Applause] disappointed no charge for that one but church quit looking to yourself there's too many disappointed people there's too many unsatisfied people because they're looking at the wrong thing don't look to a preacher don't look to a personality don't look to nobody you ain't going to find the faithfulness that you're looking for sir faithfulness cannot be found in mankind and you say amen amen now the faithfulness that I'm talking about is is being faithful to God in his word faithful to believe the word faithful to follow and obey the word faithful to confess the word faithful to fulfill the word of God can you say Amen so so then then you know the prophet said it's the unbeliever that is unfaithful to the word yeah and I'm going to be honest how how else could we be anything else but unfaithful to the word in our human ability in our flesh we we we were all conceived in sin we were all born with a carnal nature the Bible says that the carnal mind is enity against God it's it's not subject to the laws or the word of God and it cannot be subject hello that's right so so a man can be religious and still be unfaithful to the word of God he can be a singer musician preacher Deacon whatever you want to be he wants to be and still be unfaithful to the word of God he can cast out devils and be unfaithful to the word of God he could prophesy speak in tongues and being faithful to the word of God what the Bible says not everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father see faithful ain't that right many will say to me in that day Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy name in in thy name cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works and I will profess unto them I never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity why they done all of the things that we are supposed to do yet they were not faithful to the word of God and you say amen and because people aren't faithful all right come on because people ain't got something within them to be faithful to keep them faithful they're going to be deceived just bear with me for a few more moments I'll let you go I ain't a pharaoh preacher I will let your people go come on but because if they ain't got something to keep them faithful they're going to be deceived and that's the problem we're living in the greatest age of deception ever ain't that right see well the Bible tells us that all who don't have their names in the Lamb's Book of Life written they're they're going to they're going to wander after the Beast and they're going to worship Him Revelations 12:9 say the Great Dragon that old serpent called the devil and Satan deceiveth the whole world but then Jesus would say but he that endureth to the end the same shall be saved now I'm going to just be honest with you it's the elect that's going to endure to the end can you say Amen Jesus already told us it's impossible for the elect to be deceived he's not scared to put you in this great age of deception he's faithful God is faithful can you say Amen see so therefore we may have we may have been born in sin having a vile nature and was under the condemnation of of of sin and death but it wasn't by our own choice Paul tells us in the Book of Romans that that that we were made subject to vanity not willingly but according to the purpose of God can you say Amen see we were a thought of God we were an eternal attribute ain't that right amen the prophet told us we went from attribute to the flesh to be tempted and tried that's right can you say Amen we had to know defeat we had to know sorrow and failure but that's not our end you may have been born with things amen that does not even look like God Amen but that's not your end that's only the temporary part of us do you realize the Bible doesn't call us defeated there is no place in the Bible where God calls his people defeated there's no place in the Bible that God calls us vagabonds hello Church there is no place in the Bible that God calls us a hopeless case the devil puts that in your mind but you'll never find it in the word of [Applause] God because that's not your end you might have started a basket case but that's not your end you might have started out a sinner and vile and and against God but that's not your end God is faithful everybody say God is faithful God is faithful for the Bible says the same God that's subjected us to vanity is the same God that also subjected us to a hope therefore 1 John 3:1 behold what manner of love the father had bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God not when you go to heaven and be called sons of God you're sons of God now now we are the sons of God not going to be now we are the sons of God believe it they are called in Christ chosen in Christ faithful in Christ brother Brown said they have been chosen before the foundation of the world and are abiding in their calling another place they are the ones that's resisted they resisted the devil's lie in the beginning they never fail in the [Applause] beginning can you say Amen so they're going to overcome do you believe you're going to overcome young people you're going to overcome par you're going to overcome preachers you're going to overcome Saints you're going to overcome no matter how bad it gets how low you feel how discouraged you're going to overcome but how are you going to do it Romans 11:1 I say then has God Cast Away his people God forbid for I am I also am an Israelite of the Seed of Abraham of The Tribe of Benjamin God ha not Cast Away his people which he fornew what you not uh uh what you not what the scripture saith of Elias how he maketh intercession to God against Israel saying Lord they have killed thy prophets and dig down thine altars oh what a hopeless case I am I'm the only one left amen and they seek my life now and but what sayith the answer of God unto him I have reserved to myself 7,000 men who have not bowed the knee to the image of baale can you say Amen you see where your faithfulness comes from God has reserved you God has kept you God God is keeping you and holding you by the very power of His word come on than Philippians 1:6 being confident of this very thing he which has begun a good work in you will perform it didn't you say that with me he will perform it he will perform it he's going to complete it don't you worry God is faithful oh God you love him we could go on and on God the faithfulness of God this is why God would tell us don't be conformed to this world but be ye transformed amen be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that word transform is changed changed amen you don't have to remain a sinner be changed you don't have to be a vagabond be changed you don't have to be a paer be changed amen you don't have to be a drunk be changed can you say man this gospel is all about hope it a I know I know too many people make this gospel about law it ain't law at all don't you make this message of law it's a message of Grace and there's power in it the Dynamics have come to change you can you say amen amen and the same God that changed you from a sinner to a saint amen the Bible says we all shall be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye God is faithful to his word and in this day there's a people that is rising up and accepting the challenge Hallelujah do you love him can you lift your hands unto the Lord hallelujah if the musicians will come hallelujah hallelujah God is faithful God God is faithful God is faithful God is faithful hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah can I ask you a question how many got a desire to serve the Lord amen thank you Lord Jesus thank you you know I find the the greatest thing among the people of God has Satan been able to tell them especially young people but he he hits us all one way or another but that you've crossed the line it's too late it's over I see so many people sit in church and they're Desiring more of God but Satan's got them convinced you've crossed the line and here they're sitting in church but you know what the prophet said if you've got an inkling of a desire to serve God it shows that Grace ain't over yet amen [Applause] Grace ain't over yet he said the fact that you're sitting in a church tonight yeah shows that you've not crossed the line you see you couldn't even have the desire on your own to serve God the prophet of God tells us that that desire is a creation of God there could not be a desire just born out of you from caral carnal your first nature it would had to be God the same God that created his own blood to redeem you to loose you is the same God that would work inward in your soul and create a desire and as you began to desire there was a God to answer the desire and a prophet called it the Deep calleth unto the Deep have you ever just H been out in the woods and hear a coyote and you just listen somewhere off in the distance you'll hear another coyote [Music] wo you don't know the language but there's communication that's going on something's happening sad deep calling to the Deep that's right you see the only way you could ever know that there's a God any you there's no man that could ever comprehend God and who he is but here we sit here with such knowledge of God it's because God created something within you oh yes and you begin to cry and you don't even know why you're crying for it it's because that cry is not coming from your carnal it's coming from that genan seed that God put down into your soul and it's calling for more of God but while you're calling there's another call coming and he's answering you and it's a deep calling into the deep deep calling into the deep you might have been a drunk you might have been a prostitute you might have been whatever you might have just been growed up in church and sitting in church all your life and not not not really having anything but then all of a sudden there's an Awakening God created that desire within you amen and you don't even understand why your friends don't have no desire they don't want but but all of a sudden you're just not satisfied with where you're at it's because God creates a desire and as you begin to cry as you begin to go more you couldn't be satisfied with the world you just couldn't be satisfied you go through so much in life you see there's so much hypocrisy in the message you see all these things and it should have blowed you away but there's something that's desired because you know there's a reality somewhere there is a reality of God that this Prophet introduced to us amen but I say to you there's a God that is here to answer that desire your desire to go to heaven you never been to Heaven you don't even you know where is it where is that how's it going to be we don't know but the desire desire is there the desire is there and God would send a prophet God would come and open the book amen not to he he Redemption it it's not about him coming to die for you anymore he's come to claim you it's all about Redemption claims he's claiming you come out of her come out of the world come out of this mess come out of this confusion and you've answered the call I say to you your desire isn't going to be disappointed God is
