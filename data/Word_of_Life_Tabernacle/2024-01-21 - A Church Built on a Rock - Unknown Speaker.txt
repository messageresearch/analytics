========================================

might get happy somebody else might be full of Faith yeah right brother brandom taught us that that we are atmosphere controllers yes we cre we're creators of atmosphere right we create and control the atmosphere around us let's have the right one amen as much as is in our power to do that and yet I acknowledge and I understand what it's like CU I do it many times myself you can be heartbroken and hurt and and feel like nothing's going right and you still play and I'm thankful for that you take your position you still you're still a deacon and you still greet the people at the door you're still a trustee and you still do the work you're supposed to do and you don't feel like doing it and and preaching is the same way many times you don't feel like it but you rebuke your flesh and drag your flesh forward and and you do it like brother Ben talked about last week you do it anyway why do you do it because you know it's not about you it's about something higher than that it's about something bigger than that and so you go when you're hurting when you're when you when you're discouraged and everything else and you still work and do your part to fill your place and and encourage the people of God and I say thank you for doing that there's a great reward laid up for that sir brother Joel I may not get through this this morning but we'll do our best now we can have confidence that the way a prophet set up his church is the way that Paul would have done it if he lived in this age you can try to talk me out of that but you're going to have a hard time yeah now I know that there's some things that's the sovereignty of the local church you just where you live uh what you're doing we don't have a bell to ring right on Sunday morning to bring the people kids from Sunday school there's some things it's sovereignty of a local church just your your position but on the big things on I would say the the important things the things that are scriptural brother Brandon brought those to church order and brought those through the way he set up his church and I believe if if he did it that way way far be it from me to change that I don't have the authority to change that people have asked me and challenged me why do you preach on Sunday morning instead of playing a tape I'd love to be able to just pray play a tape but a prophet told me how to have church right right and far be it for me to change that and I'm serious about that now I believe it Blends right with the scripture now brother Brandon says this and that's not not that would' be wrong to play a tape if if we felt led to do that but in our regular church services a prophet told us how to have church now brother Bram says this in the Ephesian church he said I want to say that I believe in leadership he said but it's not the leadership of men I believe in I believe in the leadership of the Holy Ghost coming through the word he said I believe also that God has set men in the church men who are gifted by the spirit and they will keep the church in order say God help me to be a part of that yes said I believe that I believe also that the church is ruled over by men that God sends to take charge but that rule is by the word notice it's by the word it's not by personality it's not by gifts it's by the word that rule is by the word he said so that it is not men really ruling but the spirit of God for the word and spirit are one now and brother Bram quotes this Hebrews 13:7 remember them which have the rule over you who have spoken unto you what does it say who have spoken unto you the word of God whose Faith follow considering the end of their conversation or their life considering what their end was we all have had preachers and Pastors in the past that maybe have passed on or gotten older you can look back and see how they did it and if if they've been a real minister of the word you can see how their life ended and and how they went to be with the Lord and say I want to be like that and we could look to brother brandom that way we remember he preached to us and we believe what he said yes so and we follow that Faith now we had that prophet in our day we're not looking for one we're not waiting on one he's coming gone yes I want to to highlight this morning the bylaws that brother brandom and they did they did bylaws and they did kind of an explanation of the bylaws what I want to look at this morning at the brandom Tabernacle and I have hung those at the back of the church if you want to look at them put them back up when you're done with them but they're actually back there on the board the actual bylaws but we'll run through some of them this morning as much as we can get through and you say well this is this is crazy well I don't have a other than the Holy Ghost so and you guys I mean if you if you want to vote me out over this sermon go ahead I I can find another job but I think it'll be okay I think we'll make it so uh brother random talks about the uh the the bylaws of the church and and what each office is to do and they wrote that down and and put it in a a document and uh he talks about the pastor and I want to compare this with the scripture he talks about the pastor he said the office of the pastor is to conduct and act upon any program of which he believes to be according to the plan of God according to the word of God for the Bram Tabernacle was his church he shall assume supreme authority meet meet promoting for the spiritual welfare of the church and I haven't changed any words in this it's exactly the way that they did it he said he shall be head of the associate pastor the Deacon board the trustee board and the church body itself acting in wisdom to lead God's Saints manifesting love toward all the saints and their burdens conducting himself in perfect servitude of which God has called and placed him to act upon I don't see anything in there that that enables me to be a dictator right or to overrule the church body right right on something the church body decides but but to there got to be somebody to make day-to-day decisions about the church services and somebody's got to preach so that's what a pastor is now and and he's the head of the body in that way 1 Peter 5 And1 We compare this with the scripture he said the elders which are among you I exhort also an elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed feed the flock of God which is among you that's a challenge God gave me to do feed the flock that that's my that's my mandate from God feed the flock of God which is among you taking the oversight thereof not by constraint so if you don't want to go here to church you don't have to go here to church and if you leave I'm not going to be mad at you right I promise publicly I will not be mad at you for leaving I might be disappointed because I love you but I'm not going to be mad at you right if you leave in the right way I'm I'm not going to be upset at you because I know God didn't call me to Pastor everybody and I cannot Pastor You by constraint I can't Pastor you because I I force you to or make it sound like well if you don't listen to me you're going to go out and have a wreck somewhere you might have a wreck but it won't be because you didn't listen to me right yeah true so I can tell you that right now God's men don't move that way right so you feed the flock of God taking the oversight not by constraint but willingly not for filthy lcer that's money ill gotten gains but of a ready mind I say anybody does this for money is crazy verse three neither is being Lords over God's Heritage but being examples to the flock so he's saying instead of going out there and telling people what to do first be an example of what to do and then you can tell them what to do but don't first be an example right you got to preach you got to tell people the truth but first be an example I say God help me to do that and you understand I'm human and you're human and we'll get along somehow in that but this is the goal and there's qualifications for a preacher 1 Timothy 31 for a pastor specifically he said this is the truth saying if a man desire the office of a bishop and a bishop simply means overseer brother brand said Bishop is the office and Elder is the man so Bishop is the office of Elder he said this is the true saying of if a man desire the office of a bishop he desireth a good work a bishop then must be blameless I I'll say that let me stop there for a minute if you're going to be a pastor you have to want to be on some level right but but you also can't be a guy that that's your only goal in life and and that's all it's about well I'm going to be a pastor I'm going to be an evangelist you got to be somebody that will serve God and somebody willing to do what God calls you to do and what the people want you to do if you're going to be a preacher you just you're just going to have to have find somebody to let you preach right so and and if nobody wants to listen to you sit down and enjoy that right so excuse me for being blunt this morning but sometimes I have to be so a he says he desires a good work a bishop then must be blameless he must be blameless uh in other words there can't be something that's true about him it's not that no one would ever blame him for anything but it can't be something that's true about him that would that would keep him out of that office he can't be somebody live not living it not living the gospel he's got to be the husband usband of one wife you interpret it however you want to but that's I'll interpret it the way brother brandham did he can't be double married husband of one wife Vigilant that's watchful The Watchman over the flock sober means he can't be flighty of good behavior all right so there's more than just not being double married given to hospitality if we've never seen the inside of a home you probably wouldn't make a good pastor if no one's ever seen the inside of your home right you got to be given to hospitality apt to teach right so a pastor has to be able to teach it's a requirement 1 Timothy 3:3 not given to wine that's that's a given right not given to Wine no Striker now there's an interesting word that word Striker is not uh is not uh some I thought all my life I thought that was a different kind of wine but that's not what that is it means not a bully not a bully God help me never to be a bully right you can be a bully with truth not a bully he said not a brawler or not no Striker not greedy of filthy ler again money but patient patient wait on the Lord not wait on the people not not a brawler in other words not somebody going out causes fights all the time not Covetous not somebody wants what somebody else has verse four one that ruleth well his own house having his children oh where's my children this morning in subjection with all gravity for if a man know not how to rule his own house how shall he take care of the Church of God not a novice other words he's got to be has to be doing it for a while before he becomes a pastor has to be working being a he has to have been a minister for a while you can't just take him off the bar stool and put him right in the pull pit become a pastor L being lifted up with pride he fall into condemnation of the devil verse seven moreover he must have a good report of them he must must have a good report of them which are without that means people are not Believers right that's I hope I'm not boring you this morning you said brother Ben that's not my qualification but it'd be a good thing if we were all like this and so you got to have a good report of them which are The Outsiders because if he doesn't have a good report in the community he's never going to be able to Pastor in that community and it reveals something about his character lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the Devil look how brother the treated the office of Pastor he says this he says stay with your pastor see he's the shepherd you give him respects he'll lead you through because he's ordained of God to do so again he said and is your life worthy of the Gospel speaking of brother Neville the pastor there at Jeffersonville uh he said I turn he said this Pulpit over to a man that I have the Supreme confidence in as a servant of Jesus Christ our pastor brother Neville well that just took my breath away when I read that I thought for a for a prophet what confidence that must have given to brother Neville hear him say that I think we need to say good things about one another and so he said that about brother Neville there's actually more information in the Bible about the associate pastor and so the office of the associate pastor uh he said the associate pastor is to perform and carry out the duties of the pastor and his absence to conduct worship Services according to the manner of Doctrine believed and practiced by the brandom Tabernacle he shall be invested with the same power as the pastor is meeing all responsibility of the church acting in full authority to keep the church in order he is to manifest deep concern all the burdens of the Saints and fulfill the commission of which God has called him to as a shepherd He Shall account at various times the progress of the church spiritual matters present and problems may be pressing to the pastor only the pressing problems though he shall not he shall not undertake any business transactions without first presenting it to the pastor the exact transaction that just makes sense you say what where's there an associate pastor in the scripture they always went out two by two and in fact Mark 6:7 he said he called to him the 12 begin to send them forth by two and two and gave them power over unclean spirits in 2 Corinthians 1:1 Paul and Apostle Jesus Christ by the will of God and Timothy our brother you say well those Epistles were written by Paul but several of the Epistles have another name attached to him Timothy or Titus or some other brother there's a reason for that Paul always included his associates with him and what he was doing and that's what we're trying to do here all of our all of the brothers that preacher our Associates with me in that way so Paul was the pastor at Ephesus Timothy was the associate Paul was also an apostle he had to be gone a lot the way brother brandham had to be gone and brother Neville worked with him in that way uh there's an office of trustees and brother brandham and I'll just kind of skip through this but again you can read it trustees are elected to protect the church and its financial matters it business investment supervision of its properties its expenditures they shall strongly consider I want to point that out strongly consider every move of progress step by step which involves Church funds they are responsible to keep the church from indebtedness we are debt free today and the trustees are responsible for that I say praise the Lord and the Saints from burdens that are too great to Bear financially in the undertaking of any project he said they to bring the matter to the pastor consultation by the pastor and consultation by the pastor only for every Financial project the church wishes to invest or engage itself therein is absolutely required so they've got to consult with the pastor for they do anything but they have the authority to do things now trustees that's a modern necessity not a Biblical office but there is a place in the scripture where men were given money and were responsible for it 1 Corinthians 16 he had a collection for the Saints verse one give an order to the churches of galatia verse two he said upon the first day of the week that's when they had church that's why we have church on Sunday he said on the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store as God has prospered him to be no Gatherings when I come he said I don't want you to take an offering when I come just take one on Sunday morning and then a special offering for these people he said when I come whomsoever you shall approve by your letters then will I send to bring your liberality into Jerusalem so he's saying he's saying you can appoint men you trust to handle the money right that's what trustees are and also the treasur the deacons the deacons are uh Office of the deacons is elected according to the word of God is to act in office of spiritual assistance to the pastors they're to assist the pastors on all of his spiritual activities they're given free speech and presenting to the pastors any program or benefits that would bless the general and spiritual Weare of the church they must be apt to teach that's biblical we read we we'll read that in just a moment ready to assist a pastor associate pastor on every duty of called to do so they shall assist in serving commu communion be acting ushers in all services they shall police the church they'll uh keep civil order assist in taking local offerings oversee the spiritual conduct of the church and working with with the pastor and one another on spiritual problems and matters of the Saints and they shall be ready at any time to assist the need of every saint who is burdened and in need of spiritual consultation or general welfare so if you have a need and I've told you that before and I know we don't want to bother people but if say like we had this Ice event that we had and maybe you can't get out and you need groceries call me or call a deacon we have a responsibility to do that to help you if we can in that and that's why we want to have enough deacons to be able to do those things and and deacons from different areas that are able to help you where you where you live because I know we're spread out now uh they they uh don't have a right to act on anything that costs money without uh Consulting the pastor or the trustees and they'll be responsible before God for their conduct and manner of service according to the word of God they're not to have meetings among themselves without the pastor or associate pastor present the Bible says this about deacons deacons he said likewise must the deacons be grave and that's something I wanted to point out this morning how many know what grave means there there grave means worthy of respect worthy of respect I'm glad we have deacons that are worthy of respect there have to be men who are worthy of respect and that I believe that includes dress deportment timeliness and everything else that goes with that men that are worthy of respect so that's what a deacon is and they're not giv to much wine not double tongue that means not telling one person one thing and one person another but telling the truth not greedy of filthy lucer not greedy of money holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience and brother brandom explained that this way they have to believe the doctrine of the church if they disagree on something maybe they disagree on something little they can keep quiet about that if they if they disagree publicly about the doctrine of the church they need to resign their office right because we have to be able to work together right that just we we we must be able to work together we've got to there's a dying world out there we got a church to take care of we we're required to do a good job how many believe that today so brother brandom said put your very best man you can on your board and and and that's what my first when I'm looking for somebody or the brothers are recommending somebody we're looking for a good man first that's what we're looking for good men and men that approved themselves here in the church and we're looking for that and that's not to say if you don't have an office you're not a good man because there a lot of other qualifications too but that's the first one right and so you got to test that man brother brandom said test that man that's why we have a time period before a man becomes a full Deacon test that man first the Deacon's got more responsibility he said than the pastor has heed to be blameless the Deacon is and so there there's a proving period he said first they must be appointed and see how they like it how the congregation likes it he said then if it's all right on both sides and we make these men ordained deacons he said just like trustees are elected the same way First Timothy 3:11 says even so must their wives be grave in other words their wives must be worthy of respect not not slanderer sober faithful in all things he said let the deacons be the husbands of one wife same thing as a pastor applies to the deacons not to the trustees but to the deacons he said ruling their children in their own hous as well for they that have used the office of a deacon he said well now listen to this this is a promise to you that you that have been a deacon for years however many years that's been has it been more than 50 Years brother Danny probably close to 50 years my goodness listen to this scripture they that have used the office of a deacon well purchased to themselves a good degree that what that means is a good standing with God and with man great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus I I tell you what my hats off to those men that have stood there and used the office of a deacon well uh we we don't have time to go through every one of these offices but he talks about the office of a Treasurer what his authorities are he talks about the office of the Sunday School Superintendent ours isn't here this morning got called away but what his uh importance is he said it's a vital importance to the church vital importance because somebody's got to make sure that goes smoothly and I'll say this lately I have not had to even think about what happens in the Sunday school and I think our teachers for that and our Sunday school superintendent they've just been right on top of it and thank you for doing that so and we've got others that can fill in if we ever need them in that as well and so there's that and uh it's a necessary office he talks about the office of music program he talks about that as an office he talks about how the pastor should be should be in control of that and I'll say this I delegate that to to our worship leaders most of it but still the final say and what happens in the music if you don't like the music blame me because I'm ultimately responsible for the music so but it is a Biblical office you know music's a Biblical office yes first Chronicles 16:4 are you still with me this morning just got a few more minutes and we'll close I'm not going to drag it out brother Ben beard sends his apologies for last week he was reading the clock wrong he really did call me and tell me that so I'm just passing the word along wasn't that good last week we enjoyed that so the music program is a Biblical office he said he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the Ark of the Lord and to record and to thank and praise the Lord God of Israel appointed certain ones to do that he talked about Asaf and and all the different names that did that he said but Asaf the song leader made a sound with symbols you had a worship leader who was also a drummer he said Ben I also boy that that caused some problems in some Churches wouldn't it benah also and jesil the priest with trumpets with trumpets a brass band I love this continually continually whenever the word was there music was there yeah before the Ark of the Lord Ark of the Covenant of God and and and this drum playing worship leader David tells him in Psalms 33:3 sing unto him a new song sir play skillfully with a loud noise amen Colossians 3:16 let the word of Christ and it can be too loud I I agree with that but it does need to be loud enough to hear yeah it can be too loud I'll say this let's work together each one of us individually can be too loud but let's work together let's let's be together as a group how is what I'm doing and I mean loud not just in voice but in every way Le let's work let's make sure we blend in with the church and that doesn't lessen who we are it strengthens who the church is so what we do if it's good for the church we'll do it if it's not good for the church we don't have to do it right because we want to do what's right for God and for the church and so Paul says it this way in the New Testament let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom yes you you realize the word lives in you in song cuz a lot of times you'll remember a song when you won't remember a scripture this morning I had a song ran through my head probably you haven't heard in a long time I heard it recently and it it struck my uh it struck my uh it it struck in my heart Let the church be the church remember that song old Bill Gater song very few of my mother remembers it praise God let the church be the church let the people Rejoice yeah a great lyric a great line it that word just stuck in my heart Let the church be the church and it says I've settled the question I've made my choice that a great line we sang that song this morning I pledge allegiance to the lamb and that strikes my heart sometimes I want to stand here and pledge allegiance to the Lamb of God come on yes you think about the song he looked beyond my fault and saw my need yes that's amazing isn't it yeah I've always loved the the lyric to the love of God they say say the I think the second verse of that was written on the wall of an insane asylum and and but it but it's so true he said the love of God is greater far than tongue or pin can ever tell it reaches to the brightest star and and to the lowest hell amen and just the lyric of that is so great yeah it goes beyond the highest star and and the the lyric I believe the verse that was written there was was could we with ink the ocean F and drain the oceans dry and where every stalk on earth a quill and every man ascribed by trade if we could think about the words of that if we could if we could drain all of that it still wouldn't equal the love of God to write the love of God above would drain the oceans dry yeah nor could the scroll contain the whole they'll stretch from Sky to Sky yeah yeah I told my kids this week I didn't mean to get off on this but I told my kids this week the story of Amazing Grace written by a man who become a slave to Slaves John Newton become a slave to slaves and he was so he had gotten so far down he's raised in church but he got so far away as a little boy going off on the on the ships as a sailor he did everything you can imagine that could be done in fact I'd say his life story is almost you couldn't read it if you were a child you'd have to be an adult to read it because it's so brutal and and he did so many bad things but he got saved one day cuz he'd been taught things as a child it's important what you Sunday school teachers are teaching right my uh daughter come home last week sister Patty and and she told me all about the white judgment now I assume she meant the white Throne judgment but uh she did and I was proud of that you know that she knew that and uh but she was telling me all about it she said you go to the white judgment and then you're judge I said well that sounds good but she was telling me all about the order of you know if you die you go to paradise and all this stuff and I'm thinking that I'm glad they're being taught because John John Newton remembered what he been taught as a child this going out on me again John Newton remembered what he was taught as a child and when he remembered it when he remembered it he was in a storm and in the middle of that storm he gave his life to Christ he had many ups and downs after that one day become a minister become a preacher become a pastor of a church and he began to write that song Amazing Grace how sweet the sound that saved a Wretch like Me I once was lost but now I'm found was blind but now I see yes oh my who could write that but a sinner but I've been a sinner yeah and that word dwells in US richly yes it dwells in us so I'm so glad for the songs of the church he said let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing with Grace in your hearts to the Lord I said lift up your voice and sing sing together uh learn to be the choir amen I've said before and we'll have a choir at some point I'm sure but but I I love to have a choir but I love for you to be the choir Let the church be the church let the people Rejoice yes who's the head of the church Christ is the head of the church and he is the word he's the head of the body of the church was the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things someone say all things you might have the preeminence I want you to understand this morning you voted you say well that's not a spiritual act yes it is brother brand said there's nothing higher in the Bible in the church in the Elder of that church he said it's a sovereign Church what he means by that there's nobody up above a bishop telling him what to do and the Holy Spirit Works in any way he wants to yes he dwells among his people yeah now look I'm going to tie this all the way back to the beginning this Revelation that you have this rock that we're built on what is that is the revelation of who he is today yes yes who Christ is in our day yeah we realize brother brandom taught us you can go back and find the vote of the entire body of the church is the will of the Holy Spirit yes for the church you know that I think I got this this quote on there brother bramman said if one side wants to do this and the other side wants to do that and the side wins the losing decide what did they do about it now think about it what would you do about it if there was a major Church decision and it split right down the middle and it was 51 to 50 or whatever the vote might be and you lost what do you do about it go start another church look what he says what do they do about it join right in with the rest of them say we were wrong then we'll go right on because the Holy Ghost has made that choice now you you said where does brother brandom get that he gets that from acts one remember when they were gathered in the upper room they didn't just wait how many knows that they had a business meeting yeah they had a business meeting they got Maas to come out and take the place remember of Judas now brother Brandon said that was the it wasn't God's choice God's choice was Paul but somebody had to fill that spot till Paul Come Along Mias never did anything that we can tell in the scripture never did anything as an apostle but somebody had to be there and that role somebody's got to do it and so we don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good they had a vote they cast lot with the BR said that was their form of voting they had a vote and when they did the fire fell yes think about it yeah chapter one they they have a vote they get the church in order chapter two they begin to stagger out like drunk men yeah you said this stuff isn't important it is important it's more important than you think yes Matthew 16:18 again that th art Peter Upon This Rock I will build my church in the Gates of Hell will not Prevail against it as musicians come this morning random said that's that divine revelation of the word made flesh think about it for a minute it's not just any revelation of this you say revelation of serpent seed revelation of one God but he said a revelation of the word made flesh he said if it was flesh in that day by the son the groom it's the flesh today by what what did he say by the bride so a revelation that the church can stand on is a revelation that tells us who he he is today who is he today he's Danny Ward yeah he's Joel puit he's every one of you he's Luella Andrews who is he today yeah he's us he is the body you say that's hard for me to take if you have been baptized by the Holy Ghost you've been sealed Away by the token by the true baptism of the Holy Ghost you are in him you are sealed in him you're a part of him and you have to have a revelation of who you are and who the people around you are and if you ever get that Revelation look what he said it'll be he said he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church now I've always taken this individually but it's not what he said he didn't say if they get the true revelation of who they are yeah he said if they get the revelation of the church yeah who we are as a body yeah oh God if we can only get a revelation of who we are as a body what happens when we come together what we're a part of not just this little church but churches all around the world if you get a revelation of the true church and what she is what she stands for and that she can do the Greater Works she will be what an invincible Army the Gates of Hell will not Prevail against this church do you believe it this morning let's stand together oh do you love the Lord this morning isn't he good to us let's just let's just worship him for a moment oh Heavenly Father father we thank you we thank you for our church Lord we thank you Lord for
