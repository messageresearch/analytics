[34:44] bless our musicians we've got wonderful
[34:47] wonderful music I'm just always thrilled
[34:49] when we get to go back and listen to it
[34:52] and and watch it and I know there's
[34:54] several folks watching tonight and
[34:56] they're sick or have a need we'll be
[34:58] praying for you I also
[35:01] wanted to say we're going to have a
[35:03] little meeting on Sunday sometime
[35:05] probably after the Sunday morning
[35:06] service people just want to volunteer
[35:10] to do stuff at the meetings that move
[35:13] cars and park cars and help the deacons
[35:16] and stuff like that we're going to do
[35:18] that on Sunday and kind of tell you
[35:20] what's going to be going on also
[35:22] communion Sunday afternoon and we'll do
[35:25] our best to make sure it's not too hot
[35:27] but uh Sunday's supposed to be pretty
[35:29] mild day I think in the 80s so it should
[35:31] work for us now we've got a unit out but
[35:34] that's supposed to be replaced next week
[35:36] so thankful the Lord has worked that out
[35:39] uh so we'll have that replaced and we'll
[35:41] have have it cool again for you I I know
[35:45] sometimes you come in early in the
[35:47] morning on Sundays it's cold well
[35:48] there's a reason for that because it
[35:50] won't keep up in the afternoon so trying
[35:52] to balance it out so but we'll uh we'll
[35:55] we'll get there to one of our units went
[35:57] down but it served US 23 years so that's
[36:00] probably a pretty good record actually
[36:02] Exodus chapter 2 and verse 11.
[36:06] don't forget communion Sunday afternoon
[36:08] also Brother David Morris is having
[36:10] meetings this week if y'all would want
[36:12] to go to that I think the services start
[36:14] at seven in the evening and brothers
[36:16] Willie Smiley's going to be there I'm
[36:18] not sure what nights he's preaching but
[36:19] I enjoy brother Smiley's Ministry from
[36:21] Florida and there's some other brothers
[36:23] as well not sure about the other ones
[36:25] but uh as far as I don't know them
[36:28] haven't heard them preach but but I know
[36:30] brother smile he's a real good man a man
[36:32] of God
[36:33] and so you'd be welcome I'm sure over
[36:36] there
[36:37] it came to pass in those days when Moses
[36:40] was grown that he went out into his
[36:42] brethren looked on their burdens and he
[36:45] spied an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew one
[36:48] of his brethren
[36:49] [Music]
[36:50] and he looked this way and that way
[36:53] when he saw that there was no man he
[36:56] slew the Egyptian and hid him in the
[36:58] sand
[36:59] and when he went out the second day
[37:01] behold two men of the Hebrews strove
[37:03] together and he said to him that did the
[37:05] wrong wherefore Smite of thou thy fellow
[37:08] and he said who made the apprents and a
[37:10] judge over us
[37:11] intend to style to kill me and thou
[37:13] killest the Egyptian and Moses feared
[37:16] and said surely this thing is known
[37:18] and when Pharaoh heard this thing he
[37:20] sought to say Moses
[37:22] Moses fled from the face of pharaoh and
[37:25] dwelt in the land of Midian and he sat
[37:27] down by a well I want to speak to you
[37:30] tonight on the subject of a prisoner
[37:33] let's bow our heads together for a word
[37:35] of prayer Heavenly Father we're so
[37:37] grateful to be in your house tonight
[37:39] so thankful to be Lord the church
[37:42] Lord the people of God to be your body
[37:45] here on the earth your hands your feet
[37:47] your lips Lord I pray God that you'd
[37:51] help us tonight to be that part of the
[37:52] body that we were called to be
[37:54] Lord to be ears that's the part of the
[37:57] body that we were called to be to listen
[37:59] Lord to to speak only those words that
[38:02] you called for us to speak Lord as we as
[38:05] we preach may it only be those words
[38:07] that that would be beneficial to your
[38:09] people we pray or we wouldn't want to do
[38:11] anything to to hurt anybody Lord we want
[38:15] to help we want to edify and so I pray
[38:17] that it would be so tonight Lord I pray
[38:19] for those that are sick those requests
[38:21] that have already been made Lord that
[38:23] the little children that are home
[38:24] tonight I pray you'd bless them and help
[38:26] them Lord some that are sick and are in
[38:29] need facing surgery and different things
[38:31] I pray you'd help them Lord Lord and
[38:34] that you completely work it for for
[38:37] their good as we know that you will we
[38:39] thank you for it now we ask it in Jesus
[38:42] name
[38:43] amen God bless you you can be seated
[38:50] Gabe I can't believe you're in church
[38:52] man God bless you
[38:57] you can come to church with a broken leg
[38:58] you can come to church right
[39:03] must seem strange to Moses
[39:07] when his human effort failed
[39:11] because Moses knew who he was
[39:14] he was the deliverer he he had been
[39:17] taught that by his mother that he was
[39:20] the deliverer he was the one who was
[39:21] supposed to do this
[39:23] and now he sees an opportunity to do
[39:25] what he's been called to do and it
[39:28] doesn't work
[39:29] it just doesn't work it doesn't happen
[39:32] the way he envisioned it people don't
[39:35] rally behind him all he ends up with is
[39:37] a dead body in the sand
[39:39] a single dead Egyptian
[39:43] he understood that he'd been trained and
[39:46] and protected for this role he'd heard
[39:48] the story of his birth of his unique
[39:51] birth and and how that he was singled
[39:53] out among all the the boys of that time
[39:56] the young children as being a goodly
[39:59] child he knew the faith of his parents
[40:01] and he also knew that it was the time
[40:03] the 400 years were up it was time for
[40:07] Israel to be delivered and and he knew
[40:11] that everything was ready and the cup of
[40:13] the iniquity of the amorites was full
[40:15] and he had made a choice we talked about
[40:18] last week to be identified with
[40:20] Believers and that's an important choice
[40:22] to make every one of us have to make
[40:25] that choice to be identified with
[40:27] Believers to be a part of a church to uh
[40:30] to be a message believer we have to we
[40:34] have to identify we have to not be
[40:36] ashamed of that he made a choice to be
[40:38] identified he knew he wanted to be a
[40:41] follower of Jehovah yet he had never met
[40:44] God for himself
[40:46] or been commissioned for the work
[40:49] so it's one thing to know that you're
[40:51] supposed to do it it's another thing to
[40:53] be commissioned for it
[40:55] and and part of the problem it was that
[40:58] brother Branham taught us he was not yet
[41:00] a prisoner to the word
[41:03] he was not a prisoner to the will of God
[41:06] for his life and I want to tell you
[41:09] today that I think our churches are
[41:12] filled with many wonderful people who
[41:14] who have had experiences and and who
[41:17] have made choices and who know that
[41:19] they're the bride because we've told
[41:21] them that as we should and we've told
[41:23] you you're the elect of God and you
[41:25] belong to God because that's who you are
[41:27] and and you know that but I wonder how
[41:30] many people are actually prisoners to
[41:33] the will of God
[41:35] actually prisoners to the word of God
[41:37] and that's what I want us to examine
[41:39] tonight Lord am I a prisoner I want to
[41:42] be a prisoner I I don't want to be a
[41:45] prisoner of my own will I don't want to
[41:47] be a prisoner of my own ambition I don't
[41:49] want to be a prisoner of my own mind or
[41:51] my own ideas but I want to be a prisoner
[41:54] of the will of God for my life
[41:57] and sometimes that means that I've got
[41:59] to I've got to not do things that seem
[42:03] like I should do because I'm waiting on
[42:07] the on the unction from God on the
[42:09] anointing of God on the blessing of God
[42:11] to do it
[42:12] because there's many things that we
[42:14] could do
[42:15] and yet maybe it's not the time
[42:18] right and so we wait until the time
[42:21] because we don't we don't want to jump
[42:23] the gun because that's what Moses did
[42:25] and he ended up with a dead Egyptian
[42:28] now Paul the Apostle Paul in the New
[42:32] Testament describes himself as a
[42:34] prisoner three times in the New
[42:36] Testament in Ephesians chapter 3 and
[42:38] verse one he said calls himself the
[42:40] prisoner of Jesus Christ for you
[42:42] gentiles
[42:43] and Philemon one he calls himself a
[42:46] prisoner of Jesus Christ in verse 9 he
[42:51] says calls himself Paul the Aged and now
[42:53] also a prisoner of Jesus Christ I want
[42:57] you to notice he does not say I'm a
[42:59] prisoner of the Roman state
[43:01] although he was
[43:03] he didn't say I'm a prisoner because of
[43:05] the Jews he didn't say I'm a prisoner
[43:08] because of the people persecuting me but
[43:12] he said I'm a prisoner of Jesus Christ
[43:14] for you
[43:16] oh my that's the kind of ministry that
[43:19] we want to have and all of us have a
[43:21] Ministry is that right well our ministry
[43:23] we want to be prisoners of the will of
[43:25] God for the people
[43:27] for the sake of the people now so he was
[43:30] not a prisoner of the emperor he was not
[43:33] a PR he understood that he was a
[43:35] prisoner of the will of God
[43:37] and we know that Paul had an experience
[43:39] with God when he got knocked off of his
[43:42] horse on the way to Damascus and he saw
[43:44] the pillar of fire and when he did you
[43:47] know people that don't believe in the
[43:48] New Testament have just never read it
[43:50] like they should because if you read the
[43:53] New Testament you'll find that it
[43:55] exactly it fits in with the Old
[43:57] Testament so well that Paul being a Jew
[44:01] saw a pillar of fire and knew what it
[44:03] was
[44:04] and he says who are you Lord
[44:06] and when he does say who are you Lord he
[44:09] knew it was it was God but he was
[44:11] surprised to see that that was Jesus
[44:14] amen some people are surprised today
[44:16] when they look and see that the god of
[44:18] the Old Testament is Jesus of the New
[44:20] Testament
[44:21] he was surprised to see that it was
[44:23] Jesus but he goes down and he's filled
[44:25] with the Holy Ghost by the laying on of
[44:26] hands of of ananias there and his eyes
[44:30] come open
[44:31] but then he does not immediately begin
[44:33] to preach
[44:35] he doesn't immediately go out and do
[44:37] what God had called him to do although
[44:39] God told him he said I'm gonna he said
[44:41] I'm going to show you the things you've
[44:42] got to suffer and you're going to be a
[44:44] light to the Gentiles
[44:45] but he doesn't immediately go do it
[44:48] right and so many times we get in
[44:50] trouble by human effort because we want
[44:52] to help somebody but sometimes we can't
[44:55] help
[44:55] and sometimes what we're doing is
[44:57] actually hurting not helping
[45:00] that person because it's got to be God's
[45:02] time you you can try to you can try to
[45:05] hatch that chicken out of the egg all
[45:07] you want to it'll never work the
[45:09] chicken's got to Peck his own way out of
[45:11] the shell
[45:12] and so sometimes all of our human effort
[45:15] doesn't work and how many times I can
[45:17] testify to myself brother Joe that how
[45:19] many times in my life have I tried to
[45:21] make something work and make something
[45:23] fit and make something make somebody a
[45:25] child of God you can't do it all you can
[45:27] do is preach the word and if there's a
[45:29] seed of God that's ready to be awakened
[45:31] it'll hear it and come to it
[45:33] and if it's not you can't make it happen
[45:36] right
[45:37] right now that there's not enough money
[45:38] in the world to make it happen there's
[45:40] not enough time in the world not enough
[45:41] counseling that you could do not enough
[45:43] preaching not enough Holy Ghost services
[45:45] that you could do unless it's God's time
[45:47] but when it's God's time it don't matter
[45:49] if they're on their way to kill
[45:50] Christians like Paul was when it's God's
[45:53] time that seed will come alive
[45:56] Paul says Paul says I I'm not going to
[46:00] go preach
[46:01] but he went down into Arabia
[46:04] to study the scriptures
[46:06] to study the Old Testament to see if it
[46:08] lined up with what God was showing him
[46:11] in Galatians chapter 1 verse 15 brother
[46:14] or the Bible says when it pleased God
[46:16] who separated me from my mother's womb
[46:19] and called me by his grace oh he was the
[46:22] elected of God he knew it
[46:24] he said to reveal his son in me that I
[46:27] might preach him amongst the Heathen
[46:29] immediately I conferred not with flesh
[46:32] and blood
[46:33] neither when I am to Jerusalem to them
[46:36] which were Apostles before me but I went
[46:38] into Arabia
[46:39] and returned again
[46:41] to Damascus
[46:43] no wonder he could say If any man
[46:45] preaches another Doctrine let him be
[46:46] accursed
[46:48] right Paul knew what he was talking
[46:49] about because he got it from God himself
[46:52] and brother random taught us that he
[46:54] come out preaching the same thing they
[46:55] were preaching
[46:57] right only had the light of the
[46:58] revelation of the the gospel of the
[47:00] Gentiles but he was preaching the same
[47:02] Jesus that they were preaching when he
[47:04] come out why because he got it from from
[47:06] Christ himself the word
[47:09] so now he being who he was yet he could
[47:13] not just go do what God had called him
[47:15] to do by human effort he had to be a
[47:18] prisoner to the word we find all the way
[47:20] at the end of his life in Acts chapter
[47:22] 20 verse 22 he says Now Behold I go
[47:25] Bound in the spirit Bound in the spirit
[47:28] what was it he said it's not the Jews
[47:30] that are going to take me it's not the
[47:32] the Romans that are going to take me but
[47:34] by the spirit of God I'm a love slave to
[47:36] God I'm a prisoner
[47:38] and I know the will of God is for me to
[47:40] stand before Caesar and Testify the
[47:42] gospel
[47:43] and because of that because he knew the
[47:46] will of God for his life he said I'm
[47:48] going Bound in the spirit
[47:50] to Jerusalem not knowing the things that
[47:52] shall befall me there save that the Holy
[47:55] Ghost Witnesses in every city saying
[47:57] that bonds and afflictions abide me but
[47:59] none of these things moved me
[48:01] why because I'm a prisoner I I'm
[48:04] harnessed up to the word in such a
[48:07] manner not just the written word but to
[48:09] the will of God for my life to the to
[48:11] the present truth
[48:13] yeah are you with me tonight I'm so
[48:15] harnessed to the present truth that by
[48:18] the game I can't do anything else but
[48:19] live it
[48:22] even if it means me acting strange to
[48:25] the world
[48:26] I'm a prisoner
[48:29] now
[48:31] Moses
[48:32] had instruction
[48:35] it made his choice
[48:37] that he wasn't a prisoner yet
[48:40] and many times we grow up and as we're
[48:42] talking about the family many times
[48:44] young couples and young families and
[48:47] sometimes older people
[48:49] I've never really found that that thing
[48:53] that binds them that commitment
[48:55] that binds you to the word of God
[48:59] and I'm not trying to make you feel bad
[49:01] about that if you're in that situation
[49:02] tonight but you need to find it you put
[49:05] your anchor down somewhere
[49:07] right yeah you got to have an absolute
[49:09] somewhere
[49:11] yes it is an experience with God there
[49:14] is an absolute experience with God but
[49:16] even if you have an experience with God
[49:18] there must be a time and I think this is
[49:22] where brother Baylor said we don't
[49:23] believe in overnight conversions go
[49:25] listen to you must be born again but the
[49:26] brown said you don't take somebody out
[49:28] of the world and stick them up playing a
[49:29] guitar the night after
[49:31] because it takes time to grow
[49:34] he said you're not born a full a
[49:36] full-born Believer you're born a baby
[49:39] you gotta learn how to walk and we've
[49:41] talked about that you don't you don't
[49:43] treat them badly because they walk bad
[49:44] because they because they stumble every
[49:46] now and then it's a baby
[49:48] but there Comes A Time of maturity there
[49:51] Comes A Time of becoming a prisoner
[49:52] there Comes A Time of learning the voice
[49:55] of God and learning the will of God in
[49:57] your life
[49:58] and you've got to reach that point at
[50:00] some time at some time there's a time
[50:02] you can you can be blissfully ignorant
[50:04] of the will of God
[50:05] and you can just wander around and
[50:07] everything's good and everything's
[50:09] everybody's serving God everything's
[50:10] happy but you're going to face some
[50:12] bumpy roads down there somewhere you're
[50:14] going to face some opposition God knew
[50:16] Moses was going to face Pharaoh head on
[50:18] he had to have something that would hold
[50:19] him in spite of opposition he had
[50:22] sometimes there's something that would
[50:23] hold him in spite of the threat
[50:27] so Moses
[50:29] well it's not a prisoner yet
[50:32] and I just want to deal with some of
[50:34] these things and and we'll let you go
[50:36] quickly tonight
[50:39] now
[50:41] a man has to surrender brother said
[50:43] every ambition
[50:45] someone say every ambition
[50:48] every ambition he's got
[50:51] everything that he is
[50:53] everything his life soul body will
[50:58] Ambitions and everything else and become
[51:00] a complete prisoner to Christ who is the
[51:03] word to serve God
[51:06] now
[51:07] let me stop there and add a little
[51:09] disclaimer
[51:10] we do not surrender
[51:13] our Ambitions our life our soul our body
[51:16] and our will to the pasture
[51:20] right
[51:21] we don't we don't surrender it to the
[51:24] church
[51:25] we surrender to the will of God for our
[51:27] life
[51:28] we got to have a direct connection to
[51:30] God
[51:32] right so so that's the caveats that
[51:34] people will use that and say well you
[51:36] you need to do what the pastor says I I
[51:38] wish people you know I would like for
[51:40] people to do what I say but do it
[51:42] because it's the word not because I said
[51:44] it
[51:45] all right do it because it's right do it
[51:48] because you know the will of God for
[51:49] your life
[51:51] it's the will of God for me to be in the
[51:53] house of God it's the will of God for me
[51:55] to be whatever office that I'm feeling
[51:56] it's the will of God for me to be
[51:58] raising my children in this way find out
[52:00] for yourself
[52:04] so he said he had to surrender
[52:06] everything he was and become a complete
[52:08] prisoner to Christ who is the word to
[52:10] serve God
[52:12] now Moses knew that he was born to
[52:14] deliver
[52:15] he knew that and did you notice with the
[52:18] ambition that Moses had knowing his
[52:20] mother had told him over there she was
[52:23] his Nurse Mate now notice what he says
[52:26] the ambition brother around uses that
[52:27] word in in a prisoner uses that over and
[52:29] over and over again
[52:31] and because God can't do much with our
[52:35] ambition
[52:37] right as long as we've got ambition
[52:40] he gets in the way
[52:42] of God and it's not wrong in life to
[52:45] have an ambition to be something and do
[52:46] something but many times it doesn't line
[52:49] up with the will of God
[52:51] so we have to surrender that ambition to
[52:54] the will of God and wherever that
[52:56] ambition crosses the will in the word of
[52:58] God we we just surrender to God
[53:01] so many times God has to remove the
[53:03] ambition from us to use us because again
[53:06] that's what I found out is if you get
[53:09] somebody that comes in with too much
[53:11] ambition I don't know if you've ever
[53:12] been part of a company especially if you
[53:14] have a company that works
[53:16] in other words it's a company that the
[53:19] cogs are all oiled and everything is
[53:22] smooth and it's turning the way that it
[53:24] ought to and everything's running the
[53:25] way it ought to and then you get the
[53:27] employee with the ambition and he shows
[53:30] up he's going to change everything he's
[53:32] going to fix everything
[53:35] right but that don't always work like
[53:36] that
[53:37] it don't often work like that churches
[53:40] are the same way you get somebody with
[53:42] ambition sometimes they can do more harm
[53:44] than good
[53:45] and yet a person with no ambition never
[53:47] gets anything done but your Ambitions
[53:49] has to line up with the word
[53:51] so again uh so brother Branham begins to
[53:54] dramatize this and and he told she told
[53:57] Moses about his birth and she told him
[53:59] about how that she oh she put him in the
[54:02] in the little boat and and how he
[54:04] drifted down the river and the Gators
[54:05] wouldn't touch him and the Angels were
[54:07] all around him oh it must have been a a
[54:10] wonderful story that he liked to hear
[54:11] over and over about his birth and how he
[54:14] was protected and how he was the elected
[54:15] of God don't you like to tell your
[54:17] children things like that that you're a
[54:19] child of God son I would say when God
[54:21] healed you I was there when he filled
[54:22] you with the Holy Ghost you should have
[54:24] seen our family before that family curse
[54:26] was broken that cycle and now I've seen
[54:28] your life you're elected of God you're
[54:30] you're you are the you are the one who
[54:33] gets to lift the family up above that
[54:35] you've got a Deliverance in your life
[54:38] and it's a good thing to tell our
[54:40] children that he had to know yeah
[54:42] but in doing that it created an ambition
[54:45] in his heart and that ambition had to be
[54:48] surrendered to the word
[54:51] so brother Branham tells this he said
[54:54] Moses talking joke about is speaking to
[54:56] Moses Moses the doors are all shut
[54:59] honey you're 16 years old now you're
[55:02] going to be Pharaoh's son
[55:03] someday you're going to be the deliverer
[55:06] that's going to take the people out of
[55:08] here
[55:09] oh my
[55:10] we tell our kids you're going in a
[55:13] rapture
[55:14] if it don't happen in my generation look
[55:17] for it in yours
[55:18] I've told my children expect their body
[55:21] change
[55:22] expect God to do some things we've seen
[55:25] too many signs we're down at the end of
[55:27] the road
[55:30] Specter Revival we want our children to
[55:32] expect a Revival but you don't want to
[55:34] get our ambition mixed up with Revival
[55:37] right we want a Revival expect a Revival
[55:40] expect God to move expect the move of
[55:42] the spirit of God
[55:44] be careful when ambition gets in the
[55:46] middle of it
[55:48] so now
[55:50] he said she said honey you're 16 years
[55:52] old now Peter is 16 years old you have
[55:55] Ambitions when you're 16.
[55:59] Peter's ambition right now is to be able
[56:01] to drive
[56:03] and
[56:04] I've driven ridden wode with him a
[56:07] couple times I'm taking volunteers right
[56:09] now
[56:12] uh
[56:14] that's
[56:15] he's 16.
[56:17] and you got Ambitions when you're 16. I
[56:20] remember when I was 16 I was going to
[56:21] change the world
[56:23] I had an ambition to be an evangelist
[56:26] never had an ambition to be a pastor
[56:27] much
[56:29] but I had an ambition to be an
[56:30] evangelist I thought that was
[56:32] you know the thing to be because you get
[56:34] to preach and leave
[56:36] and if you preach long people just say
[56:38] well the spirit of God moved you know
[56:40] him
[56:43] so but you know here we have Ambitions
[56:47] Moses had Ambitions and she's telling
[56:49] him this is who you are someday you're
[56:51] going to be the deliverer come take the
[56:54] people out of here and the writer said
[56:55] Moses Ambitions begin to grow
[56:58] I'll study mother I'll study everything
[57:01] I can Peter hasn't had those Ambitions
[57:03] yet
[57:05] says you know what I'll do I'll I'll
[57:06] study how to be a military man
[57:09] I'll know how to take these people out
[57:11] of here I'll be a great General Bishop
[57:14] till I know how it's done
[57:16] and I'll take it out I'll get my PhD or
[57:18] ll I'll do it I remember those days
[57:22] gonna fix it we're gonna fix everything
[57:25] that's wrong fix some things that aren't
[57:27] wrong
[57:29] so then notice this that Moses got all
[57:31] the training because he knew he was so
[57:33] smart so educated so intellectual until
[57:36] there's nobody he could even teach the
[57:38] Egyptians he could teach their
[57:41] psychologists
[57:43] so psychology could deliver the people
[57:45] Moses could teach their psychologist why
[57:48] didn't he just use that
[57:50] he tried he ended up with a dead
[57:52] Egyptian
[57:53] he could teach their generals what
[57:55] military might was he was a great man
[57:58] and people feared Moses because of his
[58:01] greatness oh such a scholarship man he
[58:03] was a archbishoper maybe like a pope he
[58:06] was a great fellow he was a mighty man
[58:08] he knew that he was born to do this and
[58:10] trained with great ambition to do it
[58:14] and now we find out when Moses know is
[58:16] training and today with all the training
[58:18] making big Bishops and so forth great
[58:20] High ambition what will we do our
[58:22] Ambitions become just about like what
[58:24] Moses was
[58:25] he said God before he could get the man
[58:27] in his hand he had to strip him of his
[58:29] ambition
[58:31] oh don't you realize he's got to do the
[58:33] same thing to you and I today before he
[58:35] can get us in his hand he's got a strip
[58:37] of us strip us of our ambition
[58:39] he's got to take it off of us he had to
[58:42] strip him of all his training
[58:44] he said he did go out and he delivered
[58:46] he killed one Egyptian
[58:50] and you don't know he just took the
[58:53] opportunity
[58:54] to do it
[58:56] but maybe he thought it would work out
[58:58] differently than it did
[58:59] he thought maybe he would gain favor
[59:01] with the Israelites he found out real
[59:03] quick
[59:04] by human effort he couldn't gain favor
[59:06] with God's people
[59:08] and so he went out and he he killed one
[59:10] Egyptian and when he did he found out he
[59:13] was in the wrong
[59:14] he couldn't do that it wasn't that way
[59:16] and God had to take him out into the
[59:19] Wilderness into the desert into a desert
[59:22] place now we know that prophets always
[59:25] go to the desert
[59:27] and I've often wondered why why the
[59:30] desert because if God wants to speak to
[59:32] me why can't he send me to the mountains
[59:34] where there's grass and whether it's
[59:36] water and but they go to a place that's
[59:39] very difficult
[59:41] prophets would go to a place where there
[59:43] was nothing but sand and scorpions and
[59:46] sun
[59:47] and the reason why they would go to the
[59:49] desert is because God was going to beat
[59:51] some things out of them
[59:53] God was gonna he was gonna Scorch some
[59:55] things out of him he was going to cut he
[59:58] was gonna let him be hungry and be
[59:59] thirsty and they had to go to the desert
[1:00:01] even Jesus had to go to the desert to be
[1:00:04] tempted before he could begin his
[1:00:06] ministry and all of us I think at some
[1:00:08] point in our lives we go to the desert
[1:00:11] we go through desert places we we go
[1:00:13] into the desert we find that the desert
[1:00:15] and the Hebrews believes the desert was
[1:00:17] out of the will of God it was away from
[1:00:20] God and it was far from God because it
[1:00:22] was snow there was no rain and and there
[1:00:24] was no promise of no ability to grow a
[1:00:27] crop and so many of the prophets went
[1:00:29] out there because they had to be tried
[1:00:31] and tested before God could use them and
[1:00:33] just remember if you're in the middle of
[1:00:35] a desert today God's going to do
[1:00:37] something in your life he's going to
[1:00:38] help you in some way but he's got to put
[1:00:40] you through the desert first
[1:00:44] you got to go to the desert
[1:00:46] if you're not willing to go to the
[1:00:48] deserts you probably won't ever
[1:00:49] come out and and be a prisoner to Christ
[1:00:54] and Moses time he took him out of the
[1:00:56] desert kept him out there for 40 years
[1:00:59] we talk about training
[1:01:02] stripped him of all of his theology
[1:01:05] all his ambition now watch the
[1:01:09] trajectory of Moses life here is a baby
[1:01:11] he's he's placed in the care of his
[1:01:14] mother he gets a little older at some
[1:01:16] point brother says 16 at some point he
[1:01:18] goes back into Pharaoh's house
[1:01:21] and then when he goes back into
[1:01:22] Pharaoh's house then he goes from a
[1:01:24] Hebrew home and he goes to be a son of
[1:01:27] pharaoh
[1:01:27] and then he goes through all the
[1:01:29] training and the wars and Josephus says
[1:01:32] that he went down to Ethiopia and
[1:01:33] conquered Ethiopian did all of those
[1:01:35] things and in his life he becomes a
[1:01:37] great General he becomes a mighty man of
[1:01:40] knowledge and Science and all these
[1:01:42] things and and so he's a political
[1:01:44] leader
[1:01:45] and inside he's hiding the fact that
[1:01:47] he's a believer
[1:01:49] right but now he's 40 years old it's
[1:01:52] time to do something with your life
[1:01:55] it's time if you're ever going to be a
[1:01:56] deliverer Moses when you're going to do
[1:01:58] it
[1:01:59] and I'm sure those pressures were on him
[1:02:01] as they're on us sometimes if if there
[1:02:04] ever was a time that we have to resist
[1:02:07] status today because you can't afford to
[1:02:09] do something out of the will of God but
[1:02:11] the brown said the bride would know his
[1:02:13] voice and know his will and if she had
[1:02:15] thus said the Lord or she'd keep still
[1:02:19] and that's the age that we live in at
[1:02:20] the time of maturity yeah yeah but Moses
[1:02:23] was almost 40 years old and and he's
[1:02:25] thinking what am I going to do how am I
[1:02:27] going to make this work well he didn't
[1:02:29] have to make it work when it come time
[1:02:31] God would make it work
[1:02:34] but I love the fact that as long as
[1:02:37] Moses didn't make this mistake now think
[1:02:40] through it with me for just a moment if
[1:02:42] he doesn't kill the Egyptian he never
[1:02:45] goes into the desert
[1:02:46] if he never goes into the desert God
[1:02:49] can't train him
[1:02:51] right there's a reason why God doesn't
[1:02:53] tell us anything ahead of time
[1:02:54] everything ahead of time
[1:02:56] he doesn't tell us everything many times
[1:02:58] we make mistakes we go into the desert
[1:03:01] we go someplace maybe some some place we
[1:03:04] weren't supposed to be or some
[1:03:06] relationship that we shouldn't have been
[1:03:07] in or some kind of church that ended up
[1:03:10] being a cult of some kind and we end up
[1:03:13] in that situation we wonder why did I
[1:03:15] take that knee to her I was like going
[1:03:17] through that well God had to take
[1:03:20] and the only way he was going to get you
[1:03:22] to the desert was to get you to realize
[1:03:23] that you your place couldn't be found in
[1:03:26] Egypt
[1:03:27] you weren't going to be able to do it by
[1:03:28] human effort so you may just dig deep to
[1:03:31] your brother JT do you finally get back
[1:03:33] in the will of God
[1:03:35] what were we doing all that time well
[1:03:37] you're you're being trained
[1:03:39] oh my oh I've seen that hand of God do
[1:03:42] that in my life I see him do it in many
[1:03:44] of your lives and I think we can tell
[1:03:45] our children today just look out there's
[1:03:47] coming a time you may not have a lot of
[1:03:49] knowledge today you may have been taught
[1:03:50] a lot you may have been told who you are
[1:03:52] but there's coming a Time God's going to
[1:03:54] train you
[1:03:55] you're going to go through it but
[1:03:56] remember at the end hey man at the end
[1:03:58] there's an oasis when Moses gets through
[1:04:00] the desert he goes to a well
[1:04:03] and when he gets to the well there's
[1:04:05] someone there for him amen
[1:04:08] Hallelujah
[1:04:13] I just intended to read this tonight I
[1:04:15] got to slow down a little bit
[1:04:20] look at this brother Brandon says oh at
[1:04:22] a time
[1:04:23] God stripped him of all these things how
[1:04:25] we could look how he could look back
[1:04:27] and see his failure
[1:04:30] I think all of us could do that
[1:04:32] if we were just real honest
[1:04:35] right
[1:04:36] just take off the Halo and put it down
[1:04:38] and
[1:04:40] unattach the wings
[1:04:42] lay them down beside us and be real
[1:04:44] honest with each other
[1:04:47] every one of us could look back and see
[1:04:49] mistakes
[1:04:50] see failures
[1:04:52] he was still God's prophet
[1:04:55] he was still God's man
[1:04:58] he said how we tonight ought to do the
[1:05:00] same thing
[1:05:01] when we see our ambition
[1:05:04] he said look at the healing campaign see
[1:05:06] if the Lord did something a few years
[1:05:08] ago to start restoring healing to the
[1:05:10] sick and so forth he said everybody
[1:05:12] every organization is because it didn't
[1:05:15] come into their organization they had to
[1:05:17] get them A Healer
[1:05:19] and what have we done he said let's look
[1:05:21] at it just a moment we've done the same
[1:05:23] thing that Moses did we've went out
[1:05:25] listened and tried so hard to
[1:05:27] manufacture some kind of a miracle I
[1:05:30] smelt the disease I got blood in my hand
[1:05:32] and manufacture a miracle we need to be
[1:05:34] careful with God's men
[1:05:36] because if we're not careful we we
[1:05:37] pressure men of God who have gifts to
[1:05:41] perform a miracle
[1:05:43] and you can't just perform a miracle on
[1:05:45] a whim
[1:05:47] right and if you're not careful you'll
[1:05:49] push men of God into wrong things
[1:05:53] I'm thinking broadly now not just to you
[1:05:55] people sitting here but we'll if we're
[1:05:57] not careful we'll push men of God into
[1:05:59] wrong things until they smell diseases
[1:06:01] and got blood in their hands and stuff
[1:06:02] why because the people demand a miracle
[1:06:05] and Jesus goes down to the pool of
[1:06:07] Bethesda and he goes down to the uh to
[1:06:10] the among those five portions with
[1:06:11] thousands of people laying there and he
[1:06:13] weaves his way down through the crowd
[1:06:15] and he finds one man
[1:06:18] and he said people don't understand
[1:06:19] compassion because they think compassion
[1:06:21] would have caused him to heal all the
[1:06:22] sick
[1:06:23] that we're laying there and he didn't do
[1:06:25] it he didn't even look for the most
[1:06:26] serious one but he had one in his mind
[1:06:28] he had one that the father showed him
[1:06:31] that's the one you got to help
[1:06:33] it's the one the father shows you
[1:06:36] now he said we've tried so hard to
[1:06:38] manufacture some kind of a miracle what
[1:06:40] have we got some of the men in such hard
[1:06:42] strains broke up and become regular
[1:06:44] drunkards neurotic got their minds they
[1:06:46] switched all the way back to order from
[1:06:49] the Pentecostal objective back to making
[1:06:51] organizations and things again
[1:06:54] what have we done slew about one
[1:06:56] Egyptian
[1:06:58] that's right and we've tried
[1:07:00] we've strained we've paid we've labored
[1:07:05] if you if you think works can earn you
[1:07:08] salvation I can take you to some
[1:07:09] Wesleyan Holiness people that will prove
[1:07:11] you wrong
[1:07:13] because they outwork us
[1:07:15] I can take you to some Pentecostal
[1:07:17] churches some fire baptized Holiness
[1:07:19] churches that could outwork us ten to
[1:07:21] one
[1:07:22] we can go to some Baptist Churches
[1:07:23] that'll outwork us
[1:07:25] that's just the fact that there's some
[1:07:26] Baptist Churches out there that will
[1:07:28] completely outwork message people
[1:07:30] because they're always doing good works
[1:07:31] but that's not what we're called to do
[1:07:33] we're called to be conduits of what God
[1:07:35] wants
[1:07:37] none of our own works
[1:07:39] but the Bible said it was a type of a
[1:07:40] mule mule is always working but he's
[1:07:43] stubborn he won't do he won't follow the
[1:07:44] will of the master
[1:07:46] so now he said we've tried we've
[1:07:49] strained we've paid we've labored go all
[1:07:52] night long in prayer means to we had no
[1:07:53] voice
[1:07:54] try to manufacture something soup up
[1:07:56] something all these type of things and
[1:07:58] find it to be a total failure
[1:08:02] he said we need to going back to the
[1:08:03] desert
[1:08:05] he said crackings and struggles why not
[1:08:07] just give up
[1:08:12] I wish I wish we had more given up
[1:08:15] I've said that before you don't come to
[1:08:17] an altar when you come to to pray
[1:08:19] through you don't come you don't come to
[1:08:21] change God's mind you come to change
[1:08:23] your own mind
[1:08:24] you don't come to an altar to get
[1:08:26] something you come to give up something
[1:08:29] and get through yourself that's why we
[1:08:31] need an altar sometimes that's why we
[1:08:33] need altar calls you that's why
[1:08:34] sometimes we need to get get in the
[1:08:36] spirit get out of formality enough to
[1:08:38] where we can we can feel the presence of
[1:08:40] God and he can move us out of ourselves
[1:08:42] but it's not God it's not like we have
[1:08:44] to pray God down he's already here
[1:08:46] but we just need to get out of this veil
[1:08:48] of Flesh we just need to get away from
[1:08:51] this binding flesh that's all around us
[1:08:54] so what did they do they struggled
[1:08:57] he said why don't just give up
[1:09:00] why not just give me so much easier
[1:09:03] if you just give up to the will of God
[1:09:06] see where are you preaching what are you
[1:09:08] preaching preacher you're here you're
[1:09:10] trying to make us give up yes
[1:09:12] give up your own ambitions give up your
[1:09:15] own ideas give up your own theology
[1:09:18] it never worked it never will work
[1:09:21] we can I can show you thousands of
[1:09:24] shipwreck lives because somebody got
[1:09:26] some weird idea
[1:09:27] and ran with it
[1:09:29] and all it does is create shipwreck
[1:09:32] and I say that from experience today I
[1:09:35] know what it does to a family I know
[1:09:37] what it does to a church when somebody
[1:09:39] gets an idea for a different from the
[1:09:40] word and starts to run with it just give
[1:09:42] it up
[1:09:45] give it up and let God do let God
[1:09:47] fulfill his own word we don't have to
[1:09:49] figure it out and let God do that
[1:09:52] just preach the word
[1:09:54] he said that's what you ought to do so
[1:09:55] you go back and give up why have we done
[1:09:57] the same thing they did same thing Moses
[1:09:59] did it doesn't do any good after 40
[1:10:01] years he found himself a prisoner of the
[1:10:02] word of God what do we try to do he said
[1:10:05] when the great blessing come out the
[1:10:06] manifestation of all these great things
[1:10:07] that God has told us about how that we
[1:10:09] must be born again how we must receive
[1:10:11] the Holy Ghost of baptism in the name of
[1:10:13] Jesus Christ all these things here he
[1:10:15] said you see people instead of staying
[1:10:16] to that word harness to it what did they
[1:10:18] do they started with their own
[1:10:20] denominational Theory which had already
[1:10:23] failed and try to manufacture something
[1:10:26] to look like the truth
[1:10:28] what have we got tonight but a nation
[1:10:30] full of organized people who deny the
[1:10:32] scriptures of God who would call the
[1:10:34] life of the Holy Spirit it was mental
[1:10:36] telepathy it would refuse to such
[1:10:37] succumbing to their church and they
[1:10:38] wouldn't permit you to mention one word
[1:10:40] of serpent seed eternal security the
[1:10:42] things that the Holy Spirit has revealed
[1:10:44] and proved to be the word
[1:10:46] what if they got the same thing that
[1:10:47] Luther had the rest of them flew in
[1:10:49] Egyptian what was it maybe he made some
[1:10:51] men stop stealing
[1:10:53] see you see the type he Sue in Egyptian
[1:10:56] he reformed somebody
[1:10:58] made some man stop stealing or maybe
[1:11:01] live true to his wife now that's a noble
[1:11:02] thing
[1:11:03] but what did you make him out of that a
[1:11:05] church member
[1:11:07] come and join our group
[1:11:09] that stinking dead man
[1:11:13] I love this
[1:11:15] speaking dead man was the only thing he
[1:11:18] could Point his finger to of success of
[1:11:21] 40 years of training a stinking Egyptian
[1:11:24] laying there rotten and dead
[1:11:27] he said that's about the way it is
[1:11:29] tonight the only thing we can point to
[1:11:31] this revival that's crossed over now he
[1:11:33] lived during that time when they were
[1:11:34] the Revival was Crossing into the
[1:11:36] charismatic world and had become into
[1:11:38] the lutherans and the methodists and the
[1:11:40] Catholics we've talked about that before
[1:11:41] the very organization that was that was
[1:11:44] promoting brother Brandon was also
[1:11:45] promoting Catholicism and going back to
[1:11:47] Rome
[1:11:48] and brother Branham called it out
[1:11:50] rebuked it
[1:11:51] demons should carry in some of those
[1:11:53] people that were there were actually
[1:11:54] promoting that we've talked about that
[1:11:56] what you have today with the great mega
[1:11:58] churches is a direct result of that
[1:12:00] charismatic move
[1:12:02] and so he says all we've got in that is
[1:12:05] a stinking bunch of church members
[1:12:07] that knows no more about God than a
[1:12:09] hunting talk would know about an
[1:12:10] Egyptian Knight
[1:12:15] he said that would tell them about the
[1:12:16] word of God
[1:12:18] he said they say I don't believe that
[1:12:20] say I don't care what you say I don't
[1:12:21] believe it that's an awful thing to have
[1:12:23] to point back to for all the strains and
[1:12:24] struggles and everything we got
[1:12:26] maybe we can point to a big school but
[1:12:28] it's dead
[1:12:29] we could point to an organization but
[1:12:31] instead sneaking it's just like the
[1:12:33] first thing we pulled out of like a hog
[1:12:35] going to swallow a dog to its vomit when
[1:12:37] we turn back it's one dead Egyptian
[1:12:40] and then he goes down talks about the
[1:12:42] will of God for Moses life and he talked
[1:12:45] about how everybody must have come out
[1:12:46] there people who knew Moses knew he was
[1:12:47] called and said Moses what are you doing
[1:12:49] in the wilderness
[1:12:50] you should have went back and done
[1:12:52] something
[1:12:53] why did you fail
[1:12:55] why aren't you doing this he said why
[1:12:57] aren't you out over doing this and why
[1:12:58] aren't you out here trying this why
[1:13:00] don't you go on with the rest of them
[1:13:02] he said Moses was out there getting
[1:13:04] stripped until he had an experience at
[1:13:06] the burning bush that declared the word
[1:13:09] I am the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob
[1:13:12] I remember my promise I've come down to
[1:13:14] deliver them I'm sending you to do it
[1:13:15] that was it
[1:13:17] listen to this it's so important
[1:13:19] he's seen the word
[1:13:22] not the ambition of the people
[1:13:25] or the desires of the people
[1:13:32] that's that's what I have to do
[1:13:36] all right if I'm going to be a true
[1:13:37] minister of God if somebody yoked up to
[1:13:40] the word I've got to see the word rather
[1:13:43] than the Ambitions of the people of my
[1:13:44] own
[1:13:46] right I've got to see the word rather
[1:13:48] than the ambition or the desire of the
[1:13:50] people because that's very fickle it
[1:13:53] changes
[1:13:54] it'll go all over the place
[1:13:57] right but but it's and it's not because
[1:13:59] people are bad it's because they're not
[1:14:01] all called to lead
[1:14:03] Moses was called to be the one that led
[1:14:05] them out
[1:14:06] they would come out but he was called
[1:14:08] believe them out
[1:14:09] so he could not be bound to the
[1:14:12] Ambitions of the people or the desires
[1:14:14] of the people that's what's so hard
[1:14:15] about leadership and if you're any kind
[1:14:17] of in any kind of a leadership role
[1:14:19] especially your dad's in your homes you
[1:14:21] can't always bend to the desire of the
[1:14:23] people
[1:14:25] and you also are not a dictator so you
[1:14:28] can't just tell them what to do
[1:14:31] so how do you make that work leadership
[1:14:33] is about having making people follow
[1:14:35] thinking that was their idea
[1:14:38] that's what leadership is
[1:14:41] right you got to get them to buy in how
[1:14:43] do you do that live the life
[1:14:45] love your family spend time with them
[1:14:48] but make sure that they know what that
[1:14:50] you know what you're talking about
[1:14:52] same thing with the church you got to
[1:14:54] get people to buy in you got to get them
[1:14:56] to think that it was their idea because
[1:14:58] you can't always bend to the will of the
[1:15:01] people but the parents had never
[1:15:02] confused the will of the majority with
[1:15:03] the will of God
[1:15:09] now watch
[1:15:10] that's true of all of us
[1:15:13] all of us are leaders in some way
[1:15:16] he said then what did he become he did
[1:15:18] not want to face the Egyptians anymore
[1:15:21] you didn't want to face this thing
[1:15:22] anymore but it become a prisoner
[1:15:25] oh my
[1:15:27] 40 Years of running stripping down but
[1:15:30] then he become a prisoner at the burning
[1:15:32] bush
[1:15:32] the mighty Moses with all of his
[1:15:34] intellect
[1:15:35] the Bible saying Moses was a mighty man
[1:15:37] in a word or indeed down in Egypt but
[1:15:39] watch he said what the mighty Theologian
[1:15:41] did in the presence of the burning bush
[1:15:44] he only confessed his inability when he
[1:15:48] seen the genuine purpose of God
[1:15:50] he confessed that he was enabled to do
[1:15:52] it yet he was trained in all the
[1:15:55] theology that they could give him
[1:15:57] trained in their best school
[1:15:59] but yet what could he do with that
[1:16:01] Pillar of Fire hanging there in the bush
[1:16:03] he said Lord
[1:16:06] I can't even talk
[1:16:09] now he was getting somewhere
[1:16:14] Lord who am I
[1:16:16] that I should go
[1:16:19] look what 40 years had done to Moses
[1:16:22] 40 years on the backside of the desert
[1:16:25] he'd married a wife he'd learned some
[1:16:26] things
[1:16:30] brother said God gave my wife for the
[1:16:32] temper like his
[1:16:34] he'd grown up
[1:16:37] yeah
[1:16:38] it comes back by the Helen he says I
[1:16:40] don't want to go
[1:16:43] he wanted to go so bad he killed a man
[1:16:45] and now he's being dragged Kicking and
[1:16:47] Screaming back to Egypt
[1:16:50] yeah
[1:16:51] God said Moses you're the man
[1:16:54] he said Moses I have come down to
[1:16:56] deliver and Moses said good go do it he
[1:16:58] said nope you're gonna do it
[1:17:01] Moses you're going to be God to the
[1:17:03] people how can I be God to the people
[1:17:05] all I've ever produced in my life is one
[1:17:07] stinking dead Egyptian
[1:17:09] it's all I've ever produced but Moses
[1:17:12] you're going to be God to the people
[1:17:13] Aaron will be your Prophet you're going
[1:17:14] to speak and you're going to speak
[1:17:16] things into existence
[1:17:18] how am I going to do it God had to show
[1:17:20] him the supernatural to even build his
[1:17:22] courage up to go back
[1:17:24] oh my God
[1:17:26] he just he beat all of it out of him all
[1:17:28] of his ambition was gone
[1:17:31] he was about to become a prisoner of
[1:17:33] Jesus
[1:17:35] listen
[1:17:37] he said I can't even talk who am I that
[1:17:39] I should go get your shoes off Moses I
[1:17:41] want to talk to you
[1:17:43] strip yourself down even your shoes
[1:17:46] you're flat on the ground again
[1:17:49] I want to talk to you
[1:17:51] couldn't even talk
[1:17:53] finally
[1:17:54] elected prisoner
[1:17:57] a elected Prophet just like that Paul
[1:18:01] was elected Moses was elected delivered
[1:18:05] this is so amazing to me
[1:18:08] if you take free will an election and
[1:18:10] put them together you realize that you
[1:18:12] are absolutely going to do what God
[1:18:14] tells you to do
[1:18:17] but he's not going to make you do it
[1:18:24] how's he going to do it we've preached
[1:18:25] about it before
[1:18:26] he overwhelms us
[1:18:30] he overwhelms Us by his sovereignty
[1:18:33] he overwhelms Us by his grace
[1:18:36] he overwhelms us with love
[1:18:39] and he leads us
[1:18:40] right he leads us he allows us to get
[1:18:44] all of that beaten out of us and he
[1:18:46] leads us right back to the place where
[1:18:48] we were supposed to serve to begin with
[1:18:50] but it'll be in his time
[1:18:54] see
[1:18:55] he said he is finally God had his
[1:18:58] elected subject a prisoner to him
[1:19:00] oh Hallelujah he could only move
[1:19:04] as the word of God
[1:19:06] moved him
[1:19:08] so you notice his attitude he said who
[1:19:11] should I say sent me
[1:19:13] he wasn't saying now God this is what
[1:19:16] I've come up with this idea about who
[1:19:18] you are
[1:19:19] so what he said
[1:19:21] God said this is who I am
[1:19:23] I am that I am
[1:19:27] very bad
[1:19:29] he didn't he didn't try to tell God how
[1:19:32] God should operate or who God should be
[1:19:35] he said who shall I say sent me
[1:19:37] he goes against his better thinking
[1:19:40] now he'd been trained to command an army
[1:19:42] swords up about face trained to Go
[1:19:45] chariots all in order Spears forward
[1:19:48] charge
[1:19:49] that's how he's going to take over that
[1:19:51] was his training but he said what am I
[1:19:53] going to use he said what you got in
[1:19:55] your hand
[1:19:56] a stick
[1:19:58] come on they quit using sticks hundreds
[1:20:00] of years before
[1:20:01] to beat one another up with in Wars
[1:20:04] they've done they've done move past the
[1:20:06] stick
[1:20:07] yeah God said I'm gonna use a stick
[1:20:10] hey man
[1:20:11] so we got computers now we got nuclear
[1:20:14] weapons go take your stick
[1:20:17] amen God still uses the Bible do you
[1:20:20] believe that what do you got in your
[1:20:21] hand if you got the Bible God still use
[1:20:23] and said well you got in your hand you
[1:20:25] got a tape you got a book God still uses
[1:20:27] that what have you got in your hand
[1:20:29] you've got faith God uses faith
[1:20:31] [Music]
[1:20:33] stick
[1:20:34] got this thing's so ridiculous to the
[1:20:36] human mind see got a stick in his hand
[1:20:39] Whiskers hanging down 80 years old his
[1:20:41] wife on a mule kid sitting on her hip
[1:20:43] little old flabby arms hanging down what
[1:20:46] a picture
[1:20:47] stick
[1:20:51] a stick just think about brother Bill
[1:20:52] God met you in a burning bush today
[1:20:55] and he said Lord why did you have to
[1:20:57] wait until I got this age
[1:21:00] and he's walking along now Bill's pretty
[1:21:02] but the Bill's pretty big and buff you
[1:21:04] know he's strong man but Moses had been
[1:21:07] out in desert so long he probably didn't
[1:21:08] have too much to eat
[1:21:10] so he was out there just a skinny old 80
[1:21:12] year old man
[1:21:13] God says
[1:21:15] Now's the Time
[1:21:17] pick up your stick go down to Egypt take
[1:21:19] over
[1:21:21] amen some of you Elders don't think God
[1:21:23] can use you anymore God can use you
[1:21:26] now he just got you where he wants you
[1:21:28] well JD just got you where he wants you
[1:21:30] Now's the Time he really wants to use
[1:21:32] you
[1:21:35] oh God
[1:21:37] that was the time but the brother said
[1:21:38] if I could choose to preach in any any
[1:21:40] area of my life he said I'd choose now
[1:21:43] he said because now he has the wisdom to
[1:21:45] be able to use what God gave him
[1:21:48] look he said
[1:21:50] he was a prisoner
[1:21:52] his head stood up for you thus saith the
[1:21:54] Lord why he finally got anchored he was
[1:21:56] a prisoner only move when the word moves
[1:21:58] me I don't only speak where the word
[1:22:00] speaks where are you going I got one
[1:22:01] commission stand before pharaoh and show
[1:22:03] him by this stick that God sent me
[1:22:06] what are you going to do after that
[1:22:08] he'll provide the next thing after I do
[1:22:09] this
[1:22:10] there you are you've only got one thing
[1:22:12] to do the first step tonight surrender
[1:22:16] become a prisoner
[1:22:18] don't think of yourself or something
[1:22:20] else
[1:22:21] become a prisoner
[1:22:23] Moses become a prisoner confessed he
[1:22:25] couldn't even talk
[1:22:26] finally when God got him in his hand
[1:22:28] where he could only move where God moved
[1:22:31] him where he told him the word he knew
[1:22:34] it was the word then he submitted
[1:22:35] himself to the word and the Holy Spirit
[1:22:37] their God harnessed Moses
[1:22:41] to the will of God
[1:22:43] oh is that what you want in your life
[1:22:45] that's what I wanted my musicians go
[1:22:47] ahead and come
[1:22:51] Jesus when he come to the Earth he told
[1:22:53] us this he said come unto me all ye that
[1:22:57] labor
[1:22:59] the tribe by human effort to produce
[1:23:01] something in your life
[1:23:03] and her heavy laden and I will give you
[1:23:05] rest
[1:23:07] that's a strange kind of rest
[1:23:10] because the next verse says take my yoke
[1:23:14] the yoke is a harness it's something
[1:23:17] that you you use to make somebody work
[1:23:21] but he's already said I'm going to give
[1:23:22] you rest
[1:23:23] to take my yoke upon you and learn of me
[1:23:26] I am meek and lowly in heart you shall
[1:23:29] find rest unto your souls
[1:23:30] for my yoke is easy
[1:23:33] and my burden is light I I read where
[1:23:36] they actually took an ox when they
[1:23:38] wanted to train him
[1:23:40] and they would take a great big mature
[1:23:42] ox
[1:23:43] and but again they'd put him right next
[1:23:45] to an ox that had never pulled a plow
[1:23:48] and they yoke them together
[1:23:50] and you'd think well they're unequally
[1:23:52] yoked but the truth was the load that
[1:23:54] they were carrying was just right for
[1:23:56] the big ox
[1:23:57] and the little Ox got to walk along
[1:23:59] beside he thought he was really working
[1:24:01] man he was really doing something
[1:24:04] all he was doing was getting used to the
[1:24:06] harness
[1:24:09] that's this life
[1:24:11] we go through all of life like that
[1:24:13] we're just getting used to being a son
[1:24:16] or a daughter of God
[1:24:17] he's harnessing us up to his will and
[1:24:20] we're just getting used to being what
[1:24:22] God wants us to be
[1:24:25] said God help us today not to kick
[1:24:27] against the Pricks like Paul was kicking
[1:24:29] kicking against the cattle prod don't do
[1:24:33] that don't stand there wish you were
[1:24:35] somewhere else his yoke is easy his his
[1:24:37] burden is light just walk where he takes
[1:24:40] you you got a big brother
[1:24:42] walking along beside you let him lead
[1:24:45] you my yoke is easy my burden is light
[1:24:49] would you bow your heads with me
[1:24:54] let God do it and sometimes you've got
[1:24:55] to let people help you
[1:24:59] being bullheaded is a sure
[1:25:01] way to poverty
[1:25:04] the sure way
[1:25:06] in business to Poverty it's a sure way
[1:25:08] as a Christian
[1:25:10] to have poverty of spirit
[1:25:13] just let God leads you
[1:25:15] get get in the harness Paul was
[1:25:17] harnessed up to the will of God until he
[1:25:20] could say
[1:25:22] I go Bound in the spirits of Jerusalem
[1:25:26] Lord I want your will for my life
[1:25:30] I don't want anything else
[1:25:32] but I want your will Lord
[1:25:37] it's a marvelous thing when you finally
[1:25:39] find the will of God for your life and
[1:25:41] then you just go do it the Yoke becomes
[1:25:43] easy don't you trying anymore it's God
[1:25:45] doing it
[1:25:46] [Music]
[1:25:48] I said God help me today I need
[1:25:52] I'll be honest with you I need to do
[1:25:53] better in this regard I need to let the
[1:25:56] big the big Ox my elder brother
[1:26:01] I need to let him
[1:26:03] pull the weight
[1:26:05] do less worrying
[1:26:07] do less grumbling do less complaining
[1:26:11] let him pull the weight
[1:26:13] maybe you're like that tonight I I just
[1:26:15] want to raise my hands to him and say
[1:26:16] Lord I I confess
[1:26:19] Lord I sometimes I pull against a
[1:26:21] harness but Lord tonight I'm
[1:26:23] surrendering it all to you but the
[1:26:26] parent said that was the first step then
[1:26:28] you become a prisoner to God
[1:26:30] would you just pray with me and and in
[1:26:33] that way Lord where I've not where I've
[1:26:35] been fighting against the traces where
[1:26:36] I've not been as burdened for the people
[1:26:38] of God as I should Lord let me
[1:26:42] let me pull oh God let it be with your
[1:26:45] effort Lord your will
[1:26:47] oh Granite Lord
[1:26:49] let me be completely surrendered to the
[1:26:51] will of God for my life
[1:26:53] Heavenly Father
[1:26:55] Lord we we lay aside ambition tonight we
[1:26:59] lay aside thoughts of what we want what
[1:27:03] we could have
[1:27:04] Lord and we want you take over lord
[1:27:09] take over walk with us oh God
[1:27:12] we realize we're not big enough to carry
[1:27:14] it on our own we can't make it to heaven
[1:27:16] [Music]
[1:27:17] how someone Lord that tried to pull on
[1:27:19] their own it would be so difficult to
[1:27:22] make it even to the end of the row
[1:27:24] but Lord with one who was built to do it
[1:27:29] Lord you who became a mature Son of God
[1:27:32] here on the Earth
[1:27:34] you can show us how you can come and
[1:27:36] live within us so God and work through
[1:27:39] us
[1:27:40] Lord help us to be yoked up with you
[1:27:42] tonight help us to be harnessed to the
[1:27:44] will of God
[1:27:45] or otherwise we'll just have dead
[1:27:47] Egyptians laying in the sand
[1:27:51] just a reminder stinking reminders of
[1:27:53] our own failures
[1:27:55] but oh God we want to do your will today
[1:27:58] Lord
[1:27:59] we thank you for sending us to the
[1:28:01] desert we we thank you for for putting
[1:28:04] us through the trial oh God
[1:28:06] because we're coming out pure as cold
[1:28:09] Lord I pray that you'd move in a mighty
[1:28:11] way I pray you'd help people to
[1:28:13] understand
[1:28:14] Lord there's some situations only you
[1:28:17] can take care of and Lord would you do
[1:28:19] those things
[1:28:21] we ask you Lord we ask in faith
[1:28:23] believing
[1:28:24] Lord we ask for those that are facing
[1:28:27] surgery those that are are Lord facing
[1:28:30] tests things in their bodies
