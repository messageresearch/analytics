If you're sick, it's a good place to be. If if you need if you need salvation, it's a good place to be. Amen. And if you need anything from God, I believe he's here to touch you if you just hold on to what he has for you tonight with his word. Amen. Just listen intently if you can and pull on the gift of God. I believe it's going to be a good time in the Lord tonight. As our pastor comes, let's sing it. Oh yes. Falling in love with Jesus. We're falling in love with Jesus. Falling in love with Jesus. Oh, it's the best thing I've ever ever done. In his arms. Sing with all your hearts now. Oh, in his arms I feel protected. In his arms I never connected. In his arms I feel protected. Oh, there's no place I'd rather be. Let me hear you sing it. Oh, falling in love with Jesus. Yes, we are falling in love with Jes. Heat. Heat. You feel that tonight? In his arms. I never disconnected. No more. In his arms I feel protected. There's no place I'd rather be. Falling in love. One more time. Oh, I'm falling in love. Oh, I'm so thankful for your love, Lord. Falling in love with Jesus. Oh, yes. Falling in love with Jesus. The best thing I've ever done. Let's bow our heads together for a word of prayer. Heavenly Father, so grateful for your love tonight. So thankful that you reached down for us, Lord. And I'm thankful that after all of these years, it still brings tears to my eyes. And Lord, an emotion to my heart to know that you love me. Though I was unlovable, Lord, and all of us were, but Lord, you loved us anyway. We're so thankful for that love. I pray that you just come tonight and express yourself to your people through your word. Lord, where those that are sick and couldn't be here tonight, I pray that you go through the streaming, Lord, at the they're still hearing your word. And I pray that your presence would be right there where they're at. Lord, for those of us here, I maybe there'd be a sick one among us. I pray that you'd heal everyone. We thank you for for doing it, Lord. and we come and ask you to Lord just move me out of the way and speak words of life to your people. We pray in Jesus' name. Amen. Thank you Lord Jesus. Amen. Ephesians chapter 1, we're going to go verses 11 through 14. Then we'll read down through the end of the chapter. We're going to finish chapter 1 tonight, the Lord willing. And we'll read 11 through 14. I was going to tell on brother Joel if he hadn't told on himself. He's up here singing with pneumonia. At least that's what the doctors say and but uh we believe in the great physicians a healer and brother Joel's going this weekend to preach at Van Beern Arkansas for a little church over there and he didn't know whether to go or not. And and uh because him not being here and I'm not going to be here this weekend. um be away preaching at Galina and um but it's a little church. They don't get to bring in a special speaker very often and so it's a great privilege for them to have brother Joel and and Joel's been so uh dedicated here and faithful. Would you just pray for Brother Joel this weekend that he'll be able to preach to those people and and uh be a help to that little church over there? Would you do that? And uh because it's not easy to uh continue to preach and and do what we do uh with when you're sick and because you use your body. God uses our bodies to preach. And so we'll just be praying for brother Joel that he'll be completely well by Saturday night when he preaches over in Van Beurren. And just be praying for him and for us as we travel as well. Going to be a lot of people traveling this weekend. So we won't have two services on Sunday. We'll just have Sunday morning service. It'll give all of you a little bit of a break as well. But it'll be Sunday morning. Brother Stewart will be here on Sunday morning. He's making a sacrifice to be here as well when he could be with his family. They're going to be uh gone, I believe. But but he made a sacrifice to stay as well. And so I'm thankful for these men of God that he's allowed me to serve with and and I hope that we all appreciate the sacrifice that it is to be and to do to be a minister in this age. I'd much rather sit there with you, but God has called me to do it and God has called these men to do it. And so let's just do it with all of our hearts and just believe the Lord will help us in our failures and our frailty of humanity. Ephesians chapter 1 11 says, "In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who workketh all things after the counsel of his own will, that we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ, in whom you also trusted after that you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, in whom Also, after that you believed, you were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise, which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory. I pray the Lord would add his blessing to the word. You may be seated. I was also going to mention that uh next Wednesday night, Brother Timothy Puit will be here with us. So, we'll be looking forward to that. Hearing brother Timothy again, it's been a while since he's been here. I will be here as well, but brother Timothy is going to be passing through, so I ask him to speak on Wednesday night. I want to ask us a question tonight. If you could change your lot in life, and your lot in life is everything about yourself, your past, your mistakes, your successes, and your failures. And if you could trade that with anyone else in the world, would you do it? Now, I want you to think deeply about that for just a moment because the the the answer may uh it may be determined by how well we understand what we've been studying in Ephesians chapter 1. Because what Paul does in Ephesians chapter 1 is he's taking chance out of the equation. He's saying you're not who you are spiritually or even naturally by chance. A and you're also not who you are by human manipulation. Now, I know that's hard to believe because we come uh we we want to uh look at our lives and think, well, I am what I am because so and so did this and so and so did that. And that's true. But if you have an all powerful God who controls everything and knows every uh every uh flea that that that falls to the ground, every bird that falls to the ground, every flea, brother Bram said, how much tallow it would make. He knows every every bird, every flower, he knows every hair that's ever been on your head. He knows all about that. and and you believe that in that kind of a God, then everything he does or doesn't do matters in life. And so if he if he withheld uh you know, maybe he you you got sick and and it changed your life in in some way that you had some sickness that you carried through life or maybe you had a background of a certain way. you were born under a cloud. Maybe certain parents that or that maybe weren't even married or something and and or maybe they were married but they treated you in a certain way that you say, "Well, I wish I had different parents. I wish I'd been born in a in a different way. I wish I'd have been born without that cloud hanging over me." And yet at the same time we recognize that when we understand Ephesians chapter 1, then what we are is the only thing that we could be. &gt;&gt; Right? And that God has made us what we are and he's called us to be what we are. And so we remove chance from the equation. We remove human manipulation from the equation. And Paul says you are the elected of God, the predestinated of God. You were in the mind of God before the foundation of the earth. And so we you have an inheritance in him. And that word inheritance is literally to appoint by lot to assign to a category or a group based on the result of something which cannot be temporarily controlled. Right? Which cannot be temporarily controlled. How many know what casting lots is &gt;&gt; in the Bible? They would cast lots. And you've heard the uh expression, well, I drew the short straw. And we've heard that expression. Well, that's what lots are. They would take a certain number of sticks, however many people that there were, one of the sticks would be shorter than all the rest. And so, each one would draw a stick, and the one who drew the short stick would be the one that something bad happened to, &gt;&gt; right? And that's casting lots. And we know that in the Old Testament that God even expressed his will through the lot. &gt;&gt; Did you know that? In fact, the land was first divided by lot. Joshua, he actually had the land divided. So Judah got the exact location of their land, not by human manipulation, not by Joshua saying, "Well, Judah would would be good over here." and not by uh not by chance but by lot which was influenced by God. &gt;&gt; Right? So even the seemingly chance things that happen in our lives are influenced by an all powerful God who knows everything about us. &gt;&gt; And so there's no room for self-pity in that is there. There there's no room for that. You know that's the devil's favorite kind of party. maybe right next to the Christmas party, you know, for some people. But but the devil's favorite kind of party is actually a pity party, &gt;&gt; right? He loves a pity party because he I know some of you are looking at me like, "Brother Ben, you don't understand how I was raised or or what I've been through. How could you say?" But see, God allowed you to go through what you went through. And and God allowed you to be raised the way you were raised because it may have been the only way that he could produce the kind of character that you have today. And so we we can't have a pity party about who we are, who our parents were. We can't hate people because maybe the Lord told him to do it. Maybe he withheld his hand just enough that they would do what they did. &gt;&gt; Oh, come on, church. &gt;&gt; Our God is bigger than what we think he is. &gt;&gt; HE CONTROLS MORE THAN WHAT WE THINK he controls. HE HAS MUCH MORE POWER than what we think he does. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; True. Good. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. I know we don't understand that, but it's important. I say we I think we understand the concept, &gt;&gt; but do we buy it? &gt;&gt; Does that make sense? Because every time something bad happens, we question God. And Paul says, "All things work together for the good &gt;&gt; to them that love God." It didn't say all things were good. Right? &gt;&gt; Lots of bad stuff happens to good people, &gt;&gt; but all things work together for the good. &gt;&gt; So God knowing what your life would be and who you would be and and everything about you knew that in this particular time that that you would be in this particular place that you would need a certain thing and he controls that. He does not fail. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He's never been forced to do anything. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; That's the kind of God we serve. And I we don't serve a weak God or a God who's controlled by circumstances. We serve a God who, if he is God at all, he knows all things. Are you with me now? God who created the heavens and the earth gave us an inheritance. The same way that he gave the children of Israel an inheritance. It wasn't chance for them to draw the lot. And today we don't draw the lot. Brother Brandon said in the church we vote. He said that's the form of drawing the lot in the church. So that's why he said if we vote on a certain thing, he said that becomes the will of the Lord &gt;&gt; because God influences the vote. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Come on, church. He influences the vote. So if a certain person is the pastor, you say, "Well, I don't want him to be the pastor." But the church voted him in as pastor. He said, "You get behind that, &gt;&gt; right? A certain person is the deacon." And maybe a certain one person didn't want him to be a deacon and maybe it was the deacon's wife, you know, and didn't want him to be. But but it's just sometimes it works that way and maybe a few people would vote against it, but they get behind the vote of the church because God's able to influence that. Are you with me so far? If he's able to influence the vote of the church, if he's able to influence the lot, the casting of lots in the Old Testament, how much more is he able to influence every little detail of our lives? And he could intervene many times, but he chooses not to because he knows the bigger picture. AND HE KNOWS MORE ABOUT US than what we know about ourselves. &gt;&gt; See, we are not just chosen, &gt;&gt; but we have an inheritance. &gt;&gt; We are chosen to have an inheritance. What is our inheritance? Brother Brham said, God before the foundation of the world left you something, &gt;&gt; a name written on the book. Hallelujah. That when the lamb would be slain, you'd be recognized with it. It's an inheritance. You're the heir of his body. If you uh leave something to your children, uh they they maybe you have two children and you leave something to both of them. There's a legal uh doctrine that says you can leave it to them per sturppies or per capita. Per capita means that if one dies, all the property would go to the other one. Purpes means that if that one dies, it goes to his heirs. &gt;&gt; So when Jesus died, it didn't go back to God, but the inheritance went to us. &gt;&gt; Right? That's what brought us the inheritance, but the one who gave us the inheritance was God before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Right? Jesus didn't give us the inheritance. He died so it could pass to us, but he didn't give it to us. Now, now hang with me for just a moment. Now, brother said there was a name written on the book. That's what he gave you. that when the lamb would be slain, you'd be recognized with it. So this inheritance is by predestination. Brother said, "How did we get it?" Because we walked upright. Listen, WE COULD HAVE NEVER WALKED UPRIGHT unless he taught us to. WE COULD HAVE NEVER FOUND GOD unless he was looking for us. That's the only way we could have ever found him is if he came looking for me. Aren't you glad? Aren't you glad he can come looking for you tonight? WE SERVE A GOD WHO'S ABLE TO REACH DOWN ON A WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND COME LOOKING FOR A LOST SOUL. He's able to look for those who have a a a need for him. He's able to find them. Even in his looking, he he knows exactly where we are, just like he did Adam in the beginning. Yet, he calls out to Adam and Adam had to respond. But God knew that he would. And how he would respond. Look, he said, "How did we get it?" because we walked upright. How do we get this inheritance? Because we were predestinated. &gt;&gt; We That ought to take all the fear out of it, all the scare out of it, all the worry out of it. And it ought to make us so blessed every day. THINK GOD, YOU ALLOWED people to be in my life so that I could bless them. IF YOU GAVE ME A FAMILY, if you gave me a wife, IF YOU GAVE ME CHILDREN, IT WASN'T A MISTAKE. COME ON, CHURCH. It wasn't some SOME TOXIC MISTAKE. GOD GAVE ME MY FAMILY FOR A REASON. He gave me my wife for a reason. He let me be in this church FOR A REASON. I MAY NOT BE THE BEST PASTOR IN THE WORLD, BUT HE PUT ME HERE FOR A REASON. THEN LET ME HELP EVERYBODY I can help. LET ME DO GOOD TO EVERYBODY I CAN DO GOOD TO BECAUSE HE PUT ME HERE. HE'S GOT A PURPOSE IN me being here. I have an inheritance in Christ. &gt;&gt; Now, God gave you an inheritance. And the Bible says what? Brother Brandham said it this way. Bible says God gave you an inheritance. Brother Brandham said, "Why you say Jesus left you an inheritance?" He said, "I beg your pardon. Jesus never left me an inheritance. Jesus never left you an inheritance. He only came down and paid for your inheritance. Brought you to your inheritance. But your name was put on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world. God give you your inheritance. your inheritance was first. &gt;&gt; So that's what Paul is teaching us in Ephesians chapter 1. God by his fornowledge, seeing exactly who would be saved, who wouldn't be saved. He sent Jesus to save those that he'd already chosen. He said that's our inheritance. God chose us and let Jesus come and pay the price that what? &gt;&gt; Shedding of his blood that no sin would be accounted to us. nothing you do. &gt;&gt; I've had people ask me and and this is the answer to that. And I've told you before, but I've had people ask me, "Well, is God punishing me for doing this? Are you in the mind of God? Do you have this inheritance &gt;&gt; then? No sin." See, in God's mind, you've never been a sinner. I wonder if we can grab a hold of that. &gt;&gt; You never did it in the first place. &gt;&gt; JUSTIFICATION IS NOT GOD COMING and saying, "Okay, I I'll put up with your sin." It's not God saying, "Well, I'M GOING TO JUST I I know you did it, but I'll just forgive you for it." No. Justification is as though you never did it in the first place. IN THE MIND OF GOD, THE REAL you never did it in Oh, God. You you NEVER DID THOSE THINGS IN the first place. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. No sin would be accounted to us. David said, "Blessed is the man in WHOM THE LORD WILL NOT IMPUTE SIN, WILL NOT ACCOUNT SIN TO HIM." &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; Will not account sin to him. I tell you this, if you ever get a revelation of that, you want to live as close to God as you can live. You want to live as close to the scripture as you can live because you want to thank God that he does not account sin on your on your account. &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "So then it is not of him that willth, nor of him that runth, but God that showeth mercy. Not because you could will YOURSELF INTO BEING A CHRISTIAN, NOT BECAUSE YOU COULD RUN SO HARD AND BE A CHRISTIAN, BUT GOD SHOWED MERCY TO you and he showed mercy to me. Aren't you glad that he did?" What? What is the inheritance? God sent Jesus to make that inheritance real to me because there was nothing I could do to inherit it. It was blank. It was valid. There's nothing I could do. But in the fullness of time, God sent. It was own good time. Jesus the lamb slain from the foundation of the world. His blood was shed that I might go to my inheritance to be what? What inheritance? The sunship to be a son of God. So, first of all, if you're keeping notes, he came to give us an inheritance of sunship. &gt;&gt; That's our inheritance, a name on a book. &gt;&gt; Sunship. So, it was more than just we're predestinated to adoption. So, it's more than just God's saying you're going to make it, but God's saying you're going to be a son, &gt;&gt; you're going to be a daughter, &gt;&gt; you're going to inherit sunship. Jesus came as the firstborn among many brethren to be one who would stand up and would say I am I am the first one to come to this position. And so he proved who he was when he st when he was there in the boat. He was human. He was asleep. He he was fully human and yet he was fully God. He was asleep in the boat. But he stood UP ON THE BOW OF THE BOAT AND HE SAID, "Peace be still." And when he did, what happened? The waves still. Right? They completely stopped the storm stopped. WHY? BECAUSE THE SON OF God stood on the ship and commanded nature. &gt;&gt; And it's the same thing that Adam did at the beginning. &gt;&gt; A son of God stood there and commanded nature. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; THAT IS OUR INHERITANCE. THAT'S WHY YOU can overcome whatever's going on in your body right now. Whatever you're dealing with right now, whatever addiction you might have had, whatever trouble you might have had, you say, "Well, I was addicted to uh to alcohol or or to lust or any kind of other thing." Remember, you are an overcomer of that. Not because of how much you run or or how much you will, but you're an overcomer because you have BEEN PREDESTINED TO SUNSHIP. AND AND SUNSHIP IS WHO THAT'S part of WHAT YOU ARE. IF YOU CAN YIELD YOURSELF to that nature, YOU DON'T HAVE TO BECOME SOMETHING YOU'RE NOT. YOU JUST HAVE TO BE WHAT YOU ARE. THAT'S THE PROBLEM. TOO MANY PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO GET BLOOD OUT OF A TURNUP. THEY'RE TRYING TO BECOME SOMETHING THEY'RE NOT. CHRISTIANITY IS NOT BECOMING SOMETHING that you're not. IT'S BECOMING WHAT YOU ALREADY ARE. &gt;&gt; The sunship. Jesus proved that. And he spoke to the fig tree as well. and and and the fig tree died because he commanded nature. And we've talked about a little bit about this. I won't dwell on it very long, but brother Brandon says, "Now the world in nature is groaning, crying, everything's moving. What for the manifestation of the sons of God, when true sons, born sons, filled sons speak, and their word is backed." &gt;&gt; Listen what he says. I believe we're on the border of it right now. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. say to this mountain, let it be so. Quoting Mark 11:23, for verily I say unto you, that whosoever, someone say that with me, whosoever shall say to this mountain, be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea, and shall not doubt in his heart. Could we think about it like this? Election is the capacity to not doubt. &gt;&gt; Oh, come on. Somebody was elected and predestined to be a believer when others would doubt, BUT THEY WOULD STAND THERE and say, "I there's something in me. It's not me, but there's SOMETHING IN ME. I BELIEVE THE WORD OF GOD." WHAT MADE YOU a believer? &gt;&gt; Your own effort didn't make you a believer. You can't change your own mind. &gt;&gt; God did that. &gt;&gt; You can't change your heart. &gt;&gt; God did that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said, he said, "The shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass. He shall have whatsoever he saith." Brother Brandon says, "How are you going to do it? Stand still." We've been talking about that lately. We talked about it Sunday. How are you going to do it? Stand still. And that's the part people don't get. They say, "Well, by effort, I'm going to achieve this." No. Are you going to get sunship? Stand still. God is wanting to place his church the sons and daughters of God. He said, "God, let me live to see it." It's my prayer so close. He said, "Till I can just feel it with my hands almost. LOOK LIKE IT'S RIGHT THERE." HE SAID, "OH, WAITING for the manifestation of the sons of God." Hallelujah. When God will make himself known, I like this. Some of you that are sick, you can grab a hold of this tonight. He said, "They'll stop sickness. &gt;&gt; THEY'LL STOP CANCER. &gt;&gt; They'll stop diseases." In fact, he said at the end times there would be diseases. He said it would look make cancer look like a cold. &gt;&gt; That's what he said. BUT HE SAID THEY'LL STOP IT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. He said that's what we're striving for now. To get in and be positionally placed into the kingdom of God before these horrible plagues strike. He said, "Oh, how good. The dispensation of time, the fullness of time, the inheritance. What is our inheritance? Our inheritance is sunship. Our inheritance is also the redemption of our body because we know full sunship comes when this body is actually redeemed. So it's not just it's not just the inner man that becomes a son or daughter of God but it's actually our entire being that becomes the son or daughter of God. It's our inheritance. Romans 8:23 he said not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit. Even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to w the redemption of our body. The redemption of our body. This is our inheritance. This is what we're predestinated to. 2 Corinthians 5:1. For we know. I wonder how many know tonight. &gt;&gt; We know. Brother Bill. That's why we can have that attitude like you had with me on the phone. We know. I'M READY TO GO. PAUL SAID, "For me," he said, "to to to to live is Christ and to die is gain." Right? WE KNOW THAT IF OUR EARTHLY house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. We have. He didn't say we will have &gt;&gt; but we have. &gt;&gt; When a baby comes into birth, brother Brown explains this this way. When a baby comes into birth, there's a spirit there already prepared to enter into that body. &gt;&gt; Right? Look at Matthew 18 and10. &gt;&gt; He says this. He said, "Take heed that you despise not one of these little ones." Right? So Jesus tells us to take special care with young children. &gt;&gt; He said, "For I say unto you that in heaven, their angels do always behold the face of my father which is in heaven." So a mother, you know, before she gives birth, brother Brandon said she could be as cranky and honory as she could be, but before she gives birth, she actually gets sweet. And there's something that comes over her that she she mellows out a little bit and she gets sweet and it's a it's an influence of another from another land. And so there is a spirit that enters in to that new body, right? So when the body drops to the earth, then there's a spirit that enters into that new body. And and so brother Brandon said it's because the reason she's getting sweet is because that little angel, little spirit, he said a little messenger to this little tabernacle is ready to come forth into the world. Well, just like it works when we are born, it works when we are born again. &gt;&gt; Right? So when you are born again, he said the angel of the Lord comes into your body. This is what brother Brandham taught. The angel of the Lord actually comes into you. He said there's there's something a spirit that's ordained of God, he said to take this body. He said then he said when now when that natural spirit comes into a baby he said then that baby has to have a choice. It makes its decision. He said then when this takes place then you see the angel of the Lord he said now comes in here it's a spiritual body that eternal when when they make a decision when they follow Christ when they believe in Christ then there's the angel of the Lord comes in. He said, "This is this is a dying spirit in a dying body." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; He said, "And you can't be in two bodies at one time." So, not everybody's going to heaven. That's not what we're preaching. But there is a spirit prepared to take everybody, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And and we don't take human life. You do realize all babies go to heaven, right? &gt;&gt; Right. We don't take human life lightly. Uh it's the strongest case that we have uh against abortion and against uh infanticide and killing babies, &gt;&gt; right? Because because there's a God, they're made in the image of God. There's something that God has a spirit he puts in that baby, &gt;&gt; right? But that don't mean it's born again. Brother said it's a dying spirit and a dying body. &gt;&gt; He said, "Now you can't be in two bodies at one time, but there can be two natures in you at one time." Come on. &gt;&gt; When you're born again, you're not born physical like the baby was, but what's happened? The spiritual birth has come to you. And while this spiritual birth is growing into your heart of God, hallelujah. Now, now watch. You started off a new Christian. You were a new baby and you desired the sincere milk of the word and you just knew a little bit about the word and you you just loved the Lord, but you were a baby Christian, right? &gt;&gt; Well, there was a word body growing. He that's what he said when this spiritual birth is growing your heart of God there's a physical or celestial body growing he said to receive that spirit. &gt;&gt; So what happens when a person dies as a Christian is that that that word body has grown to receive &gt;&gt; that spirit &gt;&gt; that's been born again. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. that was in God from the beginning. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; He said, and when he said this life, the life leaves this body, he said it goes to that body. Just as when the body is presented to the earth, the spirit comes in. And when the spirit goes out of the body, there's a body waiting. For we know after this earthly tabernacle be dissolved, we have one already waiting. See, that's it. The spiritual body of the people. See, he was the word. Now, Christ was the word from the beginning. How many know that? I know this is deep, but you can go come back and listen to it, study the message, and we're kind of moving fast because we just want to see what our inheritance is. But he was the word from the beginning, but we bypassed our theophony. So, he come from the attribute to word to flesh, back to word, and then took a glorified body. &gt;&gt; Right? We came from attribute, &gt;&gt; right? We were an attribute of God. But we bypassed our theophony, our word body, and came to flesh, NOT KNOWING WHO WE WERE. &gt;&gt; BUT HE KNEW ALL THE TIME. &gt;&gt; Put in a chicken pin, as it were, an eagle in a chicken pin. &gt;&gt; But he knew who he what we were &gt;&gt; and where we were. So we were we we bypassed our theophony and become flesh man to be tempted by sin. And then if this earthly TABERNACLE IS DISSOLVED, WE HAVE ONE ALREADY WAITING. &gt;&gt; He said, "We have not yet the bodies." He said, "When this body receives the spirit of God, though the immortal life inside of you throws this body in subjection to God, &gt;&gt; right? This body mortal cannot inherit immortality. This body will not be saved if you can put it like that. It has to be changed a and it has to be renewed. It had to be made new in order to go into heaven." Even a glorified body is not just this body. It's this body glorified in its perfect condition. But he said we have not. He said the the immortal life inside of you throws this body, this flesh body, this sinful body in subjection to God. Now, I hope you're hearing me. A person say, "Well, I I can do whatever I want. I can go out and live with women and and run around on the streets and drink alcohol and and do whatever I want. Smoke and drink and carry on. I'm predestined of God. No, that's not how it works. Because what happens is if you had the spirit of God in you, &gt;&gt; you might be predestined, but you're not born yet. &gt;&gt; Because if you were born, another nature would have come into you. And that nature to come into you would be greater than the nature of the flesh. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And it would take uh precedence over the flesh. It would it would begin to dominate the flesh. Oh my. And throw that body in subjection to God. He said, "You don't have to say, "Oh, if I could just quit drinking. IF I COULD JUST JUST GET IN CHRIST and it's all gone." Because your body is subject to the spirit. It's no more subject to the things of the world. They're dead. So you see a person that's living in sin claiming to be predestined. I know that's a great stumbling block to people. It's the greatest argument the devil has. Well, predestination must not be real. Election must not be real. Cuz some people live in sin claiming to be Christians, but they're just never been born again yet. If they live that way constantly, it just means that they need a new birth. And if they're a candidate for a new birth, God knows the PLACE AND THE TIME THEY'LL BE BORN IN. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; So, your body is subject to the spirit. somewhere subject to the things of the world. They're dead. They're dead. Your sins are buried in baptism and you're a new creation in Christ and your body becomes subject to the spirit. He said, "Try to live the right kind of life." &gt;&gt; So, you'll always have a sticky nature, but it's subject. That means if you would do something wrong or say something wrong, inadvertently, you would do something that would be wrong. And maybe you get angry at somebody, you start to build up that bitterness and suddenly the Holy Spirit, that nature inside of you convicts you of that. Quickly you repent. &gt;&gt; Quickly you repent. Why? Because there's something in you that that's correcting you that's bringing you closer to that other body. Now to that word body. So Paul describes it like this. He said in whom you also trusted after that you heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation. And whom also after that you believed you were sealed with that holy spirit of promise. He said, "What was the salvation?" He was trying to tell them, "Predestined before the foundation of little earth to adoption of sons, predestinated to eternal life." He said, "No, after you come into eternal life, after you've been saved, sanctified, filled with the Holy Spirit, you're sons." &gt;&gt; Now, God's wanting to place you positionally so that you can work for his kingdom and his glory. &gt;&gt; So, the seal here is the seal of our faith. I don't have time to get into it tonight, but brother Brown uses the box car an analogy early in his ministry. He talks about how that there's a a inspector that would come to a box car and seal it up. He said when everything's in order and in place, he said he seals it. But later on, brother Brandham always goes back to Abraham and he says it's a seal of faith. &gt;&gt; So what he's sealing up is actually our faith. Cuz we might have some things in our life or our bodies that are out of order. God still give us the Holy Ghost because he's sealing our faith. &gt;&gt; Right. Otherwise, you'd have to live a perfect and then get the Holy Ghost. Well, you can't live that way without the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; But it's a seal of faith just like Abraham. And and so Paul goes on, he said, "Which is the earnest of our inheritance." So the Holy Ghost that you receive is the down payment of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory. That word earnest is the purchase money, the property given in advance as security for the rest. God didn't demand a down payment of you. I hope you're hearing this tonight. He didn't come to you and say, "I'll save you, but you got to give me a down payment." &gt;&gt; That's not what he said. &gt;&gt; He wasn't selling. He was buying. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; HE'S THE BUYER IN THE TRANSACTION. HE WASN'T SELLING. HE SAID, "I'M I'm going to come and and buy you. I'm going to purchase you and I'm GOING TO GIVE YOU A DOWN PAYMENT &gt;&gt; ON THE final purchase." So, it's the earnest. The Holy GHOST IS GOD'S DOWN PAYMENT. Do you realize how vital it is to have the token? How important IT IS? THAT'S GOD'S DOWN PAYMENT. THAT'S HIM BUYING AN INTEREST in you, &gt;&gt; right? And so he's he's making a down payment on you that you're going to make it. And he ain't never lost his money yet. &gt;&gt; Right? He's a good businessman. He doesn't lose his down payment. Ephesians 4:30 tells us to grieve not the Holy SPIRIT OF GOD, WHEREBY you're sealed unto the day of redemption. WHEN HE PUTS HIS DOWN PAYMENT seal in you, he seals you to the day of of redemption. Brother said, "It's just LIKE A DOWN PAYMENT ON A CAR." ARE YOU still with me? I won't be much longer. He said, "IT'S LIKE A DOWN PAYMENT ON A CAR." HE SAID, "YOU PUT $500 DOWN." He said, "The car cost $3,000." He said, "But you put $500 down. Say, I'll be back to get the rest." That's the same thing he did when he gave you the Holy Ghost. HE PUT SOMETHING IN YOU AND HE SAID, "I'LL BE BACK TO GET THE REST of them." &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandham uses the example of a 95year-old preacher. All right. So, some of you elders can fellowship with me for a moment. I don't think we have a person in the church that's 95 yet. Sister Fritz, I think, just turned 92, but I I called her older than that a couple times from the pulpit. I'm sorry, Sister Fritz. But, but there was a 95-year-old Pentecostal preacher and he was brother Brandon. He got up there and he said, "My goodness, why why wouldn't they call somebody else to preach in this big convention? Why wouldn't they let one of these young guys preach? Said they almost had to lead him to the pulpit. He got up there and he started to read his text and preach out of Job. And brother B said he got to preaching. He said and he clicked his heels together, jumped up in the air and he said, "You ain't got room enough up here for me to preach." &gt;&gt; He said he got out there and he started preaching and he said, "Whoopy, hallelujah, glory." Got to jumping up and down like that. Said, "Oh, you ain't GOT ENOUGH ROOM HERE FOR ME TO PREACH." TOOK OFF DOWN THE FLOOR LIKE THAT AS HARD AS HE COULD GO. HE SAID, "AND THAT'S JUST THE EARNEST, &gt;&gt; THE HOLY SPIRIT THAT WE FEEL IN THE SERVICES, THE PRESENCE OF GOD THAT WE HAVE ALL AROUND US." HAVE YOU EVER BEEN SO LOST IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD THAT IT FELT LIKE YOU WERE DRUNK AND YOU JUST FELT SUCH A AN OVERWHELMING SENSE OF THE THAT'S JUST A DOWN PAYMENT OF WHAT GOD WANTS TO DO FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; IT'S JUST A DOWN PAYMENT OF WHAT HE IS GOING TO DO FOR YOU one day. The love that you have for one another, IT'S JUST A DOWN PAYMENT ON the love that we'll have for one another there. Ephesians 2:1 says, "He has quickened us who were dead in trespasses and sins. You hath he quickened." He's quickened. What does quickened mean? MADE ALIVE, JUST ABOUT GONE, BUT HE QUICKENED YOU BY THE earnest money. What will it be when you really get all the dividends paid on? &gt;&gt; So when you GOT THE HOLY GHOST, you you were in debt. You were you owed a debt that you couldn't pay. And your bank account was negative500 million billion dollars. And and he made a deposit in your life. IT WAS ENOUGH TO COVER YOU. IT WAS ENOUGH TO KEEP YOU. IT WAS ENOUGH TO HELP YOU THROUGH LIFE. IT WAS A COMFORT TO YOU. AND YOU FOUND OUT YOU COULD GO BUY WHATEVER HE PROMISED IN HIS WORD. YOU COULD go get it. That's what the Holy Ghost is, church. I want YOU TO WANT IT. WE don't beat people over the head and say, "Oh, you you got to HAVE THE HOLY GHOST OR WE'RE going to, you know, beat you over the head till you do." That's not how people get THE HOLY GHOST. BUT IT'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT BECAUSE I I WANT THAT ASSURANCE. I WANT THAT SEAL. I WANT THAT TOKEN. I WANT THAT SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO KEEP ME THROUGH LIFE. &gt;&gt; What is it that's kept SOME OF OUR ELDERS? WHAT IS IT THAT'S KEPT SOMEBODY WHO MAYBE WAS out in sin AND SERVING THE DEVIL? ONE DAY GOD COME AND CHANGE THEIR LIFE AND SEALED THEM AND GIVE THEM THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST. THE SAME THING THAT KEPT HIM IS JUST THE EARNEST ON WHAT HE'S going to do one day at the change of our bodies. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. He said, "What'll it be when you really get all the dividends paid?" &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The Bible says, "As it is written, I hath not seen nor ear heard, neither have ENTERED INTO THE HEART OF MAN." 1 Corinthians 2:9, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him. What will that be? &gt;&gt; You talk about joy unspeakable and full of glory. He said, "You who were once dead in sin and trespasses has he quickened together by the shadow of the shadow of the shadows." Stay with me for just a moment. He said, "What we have now," he said, is the shadow of the shadow of the shadow of eternal life. &gt;&gt; Right? What man what made that man click his heels together is a shadow of the shadow of a shadow of eternal life. &gt;&gt; He said, "What's it going to be when you come to the shadow of the shadows into the shadow? The shadow then into the creek, &gt;&gt; the creek into the river, the river into the ocean. What is it when you're way out there in redemption with a brand new body? You turn back to a young man alto together again or a young woman. You're never going to die no more." Oh, I hope church we could just believe it tonight. I I know there's a there's a spirit in people that makes them want to earn their salvation and makes them want to do those things. But if you could just recognize tonight, it's your inheritance. He wants to give it to you more than you want to have it. If you could just receive it today, listen in the book of Acts, they never after they tear it in the upper room, they never tear it again. DO YOU REALIZE THAT? BUT WHILE THE WORD WAS BEING PREACHED, THE HOLY GHOST FELL ON THOSE WHO HEARD the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. As soon AS THEY WERE BAPTIZED, THEY RECEIVED THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST. WHY? They believed what was being said. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I believe you can believe it tonight and the Holy Ghost can fall on you and then you can go and be baptized and live for God. Listen, he said he will he said it's a brand new body. What's it going to be? You're never going to die no more. He said we'll look down on earth and desire to come back, &gt;&gt; but not by natural means. HE SAID HE'LL SPEAK SOMEDAY AND THE DEAD IN CHRIST SHALL RISE AND THEIR BODY THAT I ONCE LIVED IN WILL resurrect into a glorified body. I'll walk and I'll talk AND I'LL LIVE AND I'll enjoy. Hallelujah. I'll live through the eternal ages that is to come through Jesus Christ our Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Paul gets rather personal with the Ephesians. I'll just read the next few verses. Ephesians 1:15. Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and love unto the saints, cease not to give thanks for you. &gt;&gt; I feel that way tonight, making mention of you in my prayers. That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom. I prayed that so many times for while while you're reading, while you're hearing, while you're studying the word, it's okay to study it. And you don't have to take everything that's preached. Go study it out. But that the eyes of your understanding would be enlightened. Hallelujah. God would give you the spirit of wisdom and revelation of the knowledge of him. The eyes of your understanding being enlightened that you may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints. And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to usward who believe according to the working of his mighty power which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in heavenly places far above all principality and power and might and dominion. Every name that is named not only in this world but also in that which is to come put all things under his feet. gave him to be the head over all things to the church which is his body, the fullness of him that fleth all in all. As Paul kind of finishes up that personal note in the book of Ephesians, brother Brandham does the same thing at the end of the adoption series. If you haven't noticed, we've walked through the first chapter of Ephesians with brother Brandham in the adoption series. And brother Brandham says this. So little friends, let me tell you something here right now, my darling precious people. He said, "You here in this land and the others in tape lands which will be overseas and wherever you are." I believe that was a prophecy which will be overseas. They tell me there was no one overseas listening. When brother Brandham actually made that statement, there weren't people overseas listening to tapes, but there are now. &gt;&gt; He said, "And wherever you are, don't be afraid. Everything's all right." &gt;&gt; Can we grab a hold of this today? Can we hear the words of a prophet as they must have heard it in that first church age at the end of chapter one of Ephesians as they he began to tell them I pray for you I mention you in my prayers and brother Brandham's beginning to tell us he said everything's all right father God before the foundation of the world knew everything that would happen everything works right along you love him he said keep your heart right &gt;&gt; and remember WHEN THIS BREATH PASSES FROM THIS life to you old people or to you young people, you mothers, when you see your little babies, that little baby girl, girl baby that died when she wasn't 8 days old or 5 days old, she'll be a beautiful young woman when you see her. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I know some of y'all lost children in childbirth. You You can hold on to that. &gt;&gt; That old grandpa, he said, was also stooped over. He couldn't hardly see where he was going. When you see him, grandmother, he'll be a fine, handsome young man, just as young as about 20 years old, just in the splendor of youth. &gt;&gt; He'll be that way forever. &gt;&gt; See, brother Ben, why you get emotional about these things? Cuz I believe it. &gt;&gt; Because I believe it. I've seen the dark side of life. I'VE SEEN THE STRUGGLES PEOPLE GO THROUGH. I KNOW THAT WE CAN GO THROUGH HARD TIMES. I'M NOT TRYING TO MAKE IT SEEM LIKE NOTHING BAD EVER happens to a Christian. I'M TRYING TO SAY NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS, YOU HAVE AN INHERITANCE. THIS IS YOUR INHERITANCE. THIS IS MY INHERITANCE in Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said just he said he'll be a fine, handsome young man just as young as about 20 years old just in the splendor of youth and he'll be that way forever. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. You can touch his hand. You can shake hands with him. You'll throw your arms around him. But he won't be hubby. said he'll be brother. He said, "Oh my, he'll be so much greater than hubby." He said, "You think you loved him?" Sure you did. But that was Filio. Wait till you get Agapo. &gt;&gt; He said that filio love up next to Agapo love is like a smoldering dump. &gt;&gt; Think about that for a minute. The greatest natural love that we could have for one another, he said, was like a smoldering dump. Like that old trash heap out there by by Ash Flat. a smoldering stinking dump up next to Agapo love. Brother Brandham encourages the people. He said, "Find your place." He said, "You might be nothing might not be nothing but a housewife." Well, you say, "Brother Brandom, I never done a thing in my life. I'm not a preacher." Well, maybe God brought you here to raise a family of children. And out of that family of children may come another family of children. &gt;&gt; So, it might be your grandchildren. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said that'll be a preacher that'll send a million souls to Christ. You had to be here. Oh, take heart. MOTHERS, WHY? FATHERS, WHY? You're doing something for God. &gt;&gt; It may not seem, YOU MAY NOT GET ASKED TO SING all the time. YOU MAY NOT GET ASKED TO SERVE IN THE church all the time, but let me say this. You're serving a purpose in God. He said, "You had to be here. You're here for a purpose." Well, you say all I ever done was harrow across these old claws AND I'D TAKE OUT EARLY in the evening. Didn't know how to make my kids a living. I looked at the poor little fellas with no shoes on. I sat and cried. I got an old buggy and me and Maul went to church. Most of us haven't experienced that. But if you think about it, we've experienced some hardship in life. &gt;&gt; Some of you fathers have worked and toiled with your own hands. Some of you bear the scars of that, &gt;&gt; of working with your hands, trying to make your family a living. As I heard brother Homer Longoria say the other day, he said in Hardy, he said, "We didn't find a job." He said, "We invented one." &gt;&gt; Cuz and it's true. Many of you have been around for a long time. You know what that's like. Excuse me for going just a few minutes long. I'm I'm done. But I just have to say this. I was talking to Sister Fritz the other day and and she inspired me because she told me that she had worked when she was younger and one day she lost her job and and and she uh she actually uh thought well she said I I got a car. She had bought a new car and she said I had to pay for it. So she went out in the field started chopping cotton. Back then you go out and hire yourself out chopping cotton out in the field in Arkansas. She went and chopping cotton like some of you have done. But there was a purpose in what God was doing in her life. She wasn't just chopping cotton. She was getting ready to be an inspiration to people. LISTEN, YOU WEREN'T JUST WORKING in a factory. You're getting ready to do something in your life. It may not be you. It may be your children, your grandchildren, YOUR GREAT-GRANDCHILDREN. BUT KEEP ON SERVING THE LORD. KEEP ON DOING WHAT YOU'RE DOING. KEEP ON DRIVING TO CHURCH. KEEP ON LOVING HIM WITH ALL OF YOUR HEART. &gt;&gt; It's worth it, CHURCH. IT'S WORTH EVERY MILE OF THE WAY. THIS IS OUR INHERITANCE. YES. &gt;&gt; Whether you're a factory worker, a salesman or a builder, whatever it is that you are, he said, "Don't you worry, brother. You just keep loving him. &gt;&gt; He's got a purpose for you. You just stay right the way you are. Just go right on. You may might not never preach a sermon, but you might be the great-grandfather of one that'll do it. Brother Brandon picked that up and he said Levi paid tithe in the loins of his greatgrandfather. &gt;&gt; Some of y'all are supporting. We talked about that building building things for a future generation. and you paid your offerings and your tithes and you didn't realize you were paying it for grandkids, great grandkids that the Lord carries. Some of you already have those. Find your place. We have a predestined inheritance in him. I took this last quote personally as the musicians come at the end of adoption number four, which is what we've been reading. Brother Ram said, "Young preacher, I don't know if I still qualify But ever since I've heard this, I took it personally last maybe 20, 25 years. Young preacher, get into the field. Stay into the harness. Brother Ben, why do you preach? &gt;&gt; Because I was commissioned. &gt;&gt; Say, "Brother Ben, was it an angel come down to you?" I never had an angel come to me. I never saw a dream. Never never saw a vision that about preaching. &gt;&gt; I never did that. But God put something in my heart and a prophet of God and God he gave me the ability to talk to people and I started doing that. When I did it, he blessed it and he anointed me and and then one day, I'm not just talking about myself, but all these preachers, they've gone through similar things. And and one day I heard him say, "Young preacher, &gt;&gt; get in the field. Stay in the harness. All you young preachers and things, don't you sit around." So, I'm glad our young preachers get out and go and and brother Stewart will be serving here and brother Joel will be serving in Van Beern and I'll be serving in Galina. But you're all a part of that. Don't just sit and do nothing. Go out yonder and win a soul. Do something. Get on. Get moving. Don't stop. I love that. I don't care who tells me to stop. I took this personally. Prophet of God said, "Don't stop. Get moving. Don't stop." young preacher over there. He said, "God bless your heart." Oh, God. Listen, you may feel like the lowest part of the body tonight, but your inheritance is in him. It was bought by him. You're still an overcomer. Take your position and stand. He knew you would or he would have never called you to it. Aren't you glad he called you? Let's stand in our position. He said, "What? How do we come to sunship?" He said, "Stand still and see the salvation of the Lord." Amen. Let's stand together. Hallelujah. Heavenly Father, we love you today. And we thank you for your word. Or maybe there'd be someone here who's never allowed that spirit, Lord, to come into their life. They just still have this natural spirit that Lord, you gave that to them. You're the giver of all life. Even Cain in that sense came from the Lord. But oh God, Lord, we believe that you gave us this life.
