It makes you seem like it just brings everybody together and just makes everybody closer. and and we're going to speed it up just for just for a minute. And my God is real in the key of G. How many knows he's real? &gt;&gt; It's not just about feeling him, but we know he's real because it's good to feel him once in a while. Isn't it good to feel him real? Somebody say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; There are some things I may not know. There are some places I just can't go. But I am sure. Yes, I'm sure. But this one day that God is real for I can feel within.

Has God been good to us today? Amen. Did you enjoy the word of the Lord this morning? Wasn't that good? Amen. I tell you what, this it's just it gets goodter and goodter and we just keep feasting on it and I believe it's going to help us and changes these bodies one of these days. Amen. We're going to sing All I Want to Do Is Love Him as our pastor comes tonight. Amen. I believe there's going to be something more for us this evening. Every time the word goes forth, I believe we leave better or we leave worse. And we might as well leave better. &gt;&gt; Let's accept what God has for us here tonight. Amen. I believe there's healing and communion. I believe there's anything we have need of, I believe, is right here for us tonight. So just hold on to the word of God and let it change us this evening. All All I want to do is love him now. Oh, all I want to do is love him. I'm so glad I feel his love for me. Jesus paid the price of redemption on the cross of Calary. [Music] Oh, so every day my heart will praise him. And I know I'll never be the same. And all I want to do is love him. Love his holy all your hearts. Now we're singing. All I want to do is love him. So glad I feel his love for me. Jesus paid the price of redemption on the cross of Calary. [Music] Oh, so every day my heart is going to praise him. I know I'll never be the same. All I want to do is love him. Love his. Sing it again with all your hearts now. Oh, we're singing all. How many want this love tonight? [Music] his love for me. Jesus Christ. [Music] So every day my heart will praise him. Don't you want to praise him tonight? I know I'll never be the same. All I want to do is love him. Love his holy name. Why don't you love him tonight? Let's bow our heads together for a word of prayer. Maybe you've got a unspoken request, special unspoken request you'd like to make known by way of uplifted hand. God sees those hands. He knows every heart. Let's just bow our heads to him. Heavenly Father, we love you tonight. And we thank you that you're the God who can make all the crooked places straight, all the wrongs right. We're so grateful for that today, Lord. By the cross, Lord, you bought and purchased our redemption. And I'm so thankful. I pray that you just move tonight in a mighty way. Pray that your spirit would be with us throughout the evening, Lord. And Lord, as we take communion, oh God, may it not just be a form, may we really, &gt;&gt; Lord, want to praise you and worship you because of what you did for us there on Calvary. We thank you for it. We ask that you'd touch every heart and meet every need that was that was uplifted by their hand heart. I pray you'd bless them tonight, Lord, and meet these needs. We pray in Jesus name. Amen. Thank you, Lord. Amen. have to forgive me tonight. I don't have a lot of voice. I kept you long this morning. So, we won't hold you long tonight. We'll just go right into the word of God. 1 Corinthians chap 11 and verse 23. 1 Corinthians 11:23. We'll just read that one verse and we'll read the rest of it a little bit later. Paul says, "For I have received of the Lord that which also delivered I unto you, that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread." Pray the Lord would add his blessing to the word. You may be seated. Paul does not say I heard from someone who was there. He doesn't say somebody told somebody who told somebody else who told somebody else that and it was handed down to me that this is the way we should do communion. But Paul says I received of the Lord, &gt;&gt; right? What I delivered unto you. I love the assurance of that. He he he was not there. Paul was not there when they took communion. He was not one of the apostles that sat with Jesus that night and and took communion with him. But he was one who received from God. He was an apostle of God, a prophet of God, the first church age messenger. And he said, "What I received, I received from the Lord." So that is the pattern we were talking about this morning for communion is actually what God showed the vision revelation that God showed Paul in the word. This is how that it's supposed to be done. And I know I preach a lot on communion when we have communion. It seems like we have it a lot. We have it maybe four or five times a year. Uh just the way that it falls. But but I believe it's important because in the pattern in the first church they had the communion. So if that detail was there in that first church, that detail ought to be there in the last church, just like the candlestick we talked about this morning, it had a certain detail in it that he saw in the vision. And he wanted that detail to be there. Every little flower, every the the even the weight of the gold and the weight of the candlestick. And if God wanted it to be there in the first church age, he wants it to be there in the last church age. And so we find that communion uh was a special time for that early church. Now, it wasn't long after Paul that Satan took communion and he made it something that it wasn't. I believe that Satan saw the value of communion because there's a great value not in the in the bread itself or in the wine itself, but in the remembering of the Lord in recognizing what he did for us. How many are happy that he died for you? Are you grateful that he forgave your sins? I I think if you ever recognize that you were a sinner, then there's a gratefulness that comes on you that you know, Lord, I'm so thankful that you died for my sins. I'm so thankful that you brought me out. I'm so thankful. I'm so glad to be able to take communion with my brothers and sisters. I I'm happy to be able to have this fellowship. And and so Satan saw the value of that. And immediately he turned communion into something it wasn't. and he begin to make communion actually salvation which we know there's no salvation in communion itself. &gt;&gt; So he looks at the pattern of God and tries to mimic it but it's not the same. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; So brother Brandon says the devil has a pattern of everything God has real. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We've been talking about the pattern. The devil has a pattern of everything God has real. So the devil looks at what God does. He can't see into the mind of God. When he sees God do something, he tries to pattern that. And so what what does he do? Brother said, "Babylon was made a pattern of heaven." &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh, the natural." He said, "Just exactly. There's a real genuine Christian filled with the Holy Ghost. There's a whole lot of hypocrites that act just like it." He said, "But the hypocrite only declares the real person to stand out bright and shiny, doesn't it?" He said all the false and bogus things only declare the real. So we should not not go to church or not assemble ourselves because of hypocrites. Hypocrites are always going to be there. But the hypocrite only declares the real to stand out bright and shiny. It just makes you stand out that much more. &gt;&gt; So brother Brandham again talked about Babylon. He said Babylon the very city was patterned out of heaven. You ever think you ever think about that? Babylon was patterned out of heaven. In Babylon, they had the river Euphrates flowing right by the throne and the garden, the swing garden, the hanging gardens of Babylon that had them there. He said that's patterned off of heaven, the river of life. See, they tried to recreate an Eden in the desert. &gt;&gt; Right. They tried to do what God had done, what God was going to do. In fact, they tried to do it before. They even tried to build a tower to reach to the heavens and God brought confusion on it. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But it was that Babylonian system. And so he said that's patterned off of heaven for the river of life flows by the throne of God. He said and you see the achievement that man was doing was making a pattern perverted. So Babylon is perverted heaven. Mystery Babylon, the Catholic Church is the perverted bride, &gt;&gt; right? It's Satan's perversion of a of a bride. So Catholicism takes the pattern that Paul had set forth and what Paul had received of the Lord and they they changed it and made the bread and the wine literally the body and blood in the council of Trent. uh the Catholics say by the consecration of the bread and of the wine, a conversion is made of the whole substance of the bread into the substance of the body of Christ our Lord, of the whole substance of the wine into the substance of his blood, which conversion is by the holy Catholic Church suitably and properly called transsubstantiation. And so when you they they believe it's literally the body and blood of the Lord. Now, where did they get that from? Not from the scripture, but they actually added that to what Paul taught, &gt;&gt; right? So Paul in the beginning, let's look how Paul patterned communion. Paul used unleavened bread. In fact, even in the type of it in 1 Corinthians 5'8, he said, "Therefore, let us keep the feast not with old leaven, neither with the leavenven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and of truth." And of course, they used unleavened bread in the Passover. Unleaven bread was meant to be used for communion. The bread was to be broken. It was not to remain a whole piece, but it was to be broken. In 1 Corinthians 11:24, it says, "When he had given thanks, he broke it and said, "Take, eat. This is my body which is broken for you. This do in remembrance of me." Catholic dogma took that and changed it out of convenience into an unbroken round wafer. You realize they did it out of convenience. The story, the Catholics have a story, they have lots of stories, but there was a monk supposedly hundreds of years ago who was had committed himself to not building a fire. So, he was not going to warm himself. I'm so thankful we don't have to live like that cuz I like a fire when it's cold. But this monk had had that was his way of abusing his flesh. And we talked about that this morning. Uh will worship, &gt;&gt; right? Where you just decide you're going to do something for God. We don't decide what we do for God. He tells us what to do, &gt;&gt; right? But but he they he was abusing his flesh and in that way he said, "I won't even warm myself." And but his responsibility was to make the communion bread. And so he said, "Well, how am I going to do this?" And so he got a pair of long tongs and that would reach a long distance where he wouldn't get too warm. H because that's what legalism does to you is it makes you do all kinds of odd things, &gt;&gt; right? And and so he's got these long tongs and he reaches into the fire with and and what it does is it created a very crispy light bread and it was in and supposedly it came out in the shape of a wafer and so originally it was a bigger wafer and eventually they out of convenience it come down to a personal size. So, if you go into a Catholic church today, you would kneel down at the altar and the priest would come and you would take communion and the priest would come and he would uh either put the a wafer on your tongue or stick out your tongue, you put a wafer on it or he would you would hand he would hand it to you and you could eat it. So, it would be a single serving. It's never broken. It's made that way. &gt;&gt; But they broke the pattern of God in doing that. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, how is that important?" It's important because communion is just a symbol, but it's an important symbol. &gt;&gt; It's a whole body being broken &gt;&gt; into peace. Oh church, we're not all the body of God, but we're a part of the body of Christ. And every one of us as we take communion, as we partake of the bread, what are we doing? We're fulfilling our part. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon said there's no round bread on a Christian table. &gt;&gt; It was a pagan thing. So they actually introduced elements of pagan worship. Now they won't admit this but in Jeremiah 7:1 17 he talked about how that uh he said seeest thou not what they do in the cities of Judah in the streets of Jerusalem. The children gather wood and the fathers kindle the fire. The women need their dough to make cakes to the queen of heaven to pour out drink offerings unto other gods that they may provoke me to anger. That Babylonian religion had come down all the way down to the Romans. So the Romans were interesting people because they didn't care what god you worshiped as long as you was willing to worship the emperor. &gt;&gt; So you you could worship as many gods as you wanted to. They had all kinds of gods, &gt;&gt; but they also wanted you to worship the emperor. They made him a god. &gt;&gt; And so they didn't care that all the only ones the pagans had a problem with was like the Jews and the Christians because they would only worship one god. They said as long as you worship Jesus and all these other gods, you'll be okay. And that's what the Catholic Church became was a merging of that Roman system with Christianity. And so, Brother Brandon taught us this. He said because Baal was the son god. He said the cakes was made. And Jeremiah said the women had made cakes to Baal, the son god. He said later on in the chapter, if you read it, they said if we don't worship Baal, then our crops will fail because Bale was the god of fertility. Let me tell you something and say it with all of my heart tonight. We don't worship God out of fear. &gt;&gt; We don't come to church out of fear. We don't take communion out of fear &gt;&gt; cuz we think something bad's going to happen to us. We don't do that. That's a forced worship. It's Catholicism. &gt;&gt; We don't do what we do out of fear. Anytime a man comes to you and says, "Well, if you don't do this, you'll lose your money in the bank or you'll have a bad wreck or if you don't follow me and listen to me." Brother Brandham taught us that was false prophets, &gt;&gt; right? That would do that. You don't ever let a man tell you that. You stay with the word. &gt;&gt; You young people stay with the word. Don't let somebody, oh, out of fear, I'm going to serve God. No, you serve God cuz you love him with all of your heart. Let it come from the inside. That's the worship that he wants. What house will you build me? He said, "What is the place of my rest? I want a redeemed body." &gt;&gt; People that are worshiping because they cuz they like to. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? Cuz they want to. And a real seed of God will want to. &gt;&gt; There's something in their heart that want to worship. They want to take communion. They want to make things right. They want to live for God. It's something in their heart. Amen. Now they they told them if you don't take if you don't worship Bale your crops won't grow. So some of them they was having trouble with their crops. So they started worshiping Baal out of fear. But the Brand said that Bale is a round god. So the sun he said and God was a round god a sun god. They had great big brass plates reflect the sun looked like fire. And then the bread that Jeremiah said here that women would bake these cakes under bail was made round like the sun and it was laid upon the altar the pagan altar for communion made round like the sun or like the moon. They worshiped the god Ashroth as well which was the moon the moon goddess he said because it was like the sun god or the moon god. The Catholic church took that as we know and made it the son of god right and and and Mary the mother of god but was the son god and the moon god. And brother Brandham said the Roman priests and they adopted this by taking and making communion. The first thing come up was making communion. Instead of a broken parcel like the body of Christ, they'd make it round like the sun or like the moon. And to this day, it's still round. Oh, he said, "Sure, it's still a round wafer, not a broken piece of its body. It's round and smooth." Roman priests today lay this round wafer on the altar and call it the literal body of Christ. And what are they doing worshiping Baal and don't know it? Worshiping Ashroth and don't know it. &gt;&gt; I hope you're with me tonight. We ought to thank God for the message of the hour. We ought to thank God for revelation. Brother Brandham talked about during his day, he said the priests and the the Catholics and the Pentecostals were trying to come together and he said they come down there. He said you had Pentecostal preachers sticking out their tongue and taking a round wafer &gt;&gt; because they thought, well, what difference does it make? Because they didn't have the revelation. They didn't have the word that we have access to that told us what it was. &gt;&gt; So they said, what difference does it make? It does make a difference. Amen. &gt;&gt; So he said they called it the literal body of Christ. They're communing with devils, worshiping other gods because they're sincere. They are sincere. Many of them, some Catholics, I've known Catholics that were more sincere than most message people. &gt;&gt; They they're sincere people, but they don't follow the pattern of the scripture. &gt;&gt; They don't follow the pattern, the model that's been set for us. So we find that Martin Luther during the church age took the church away from its idolatry. But over the last 150 years, the Protestant church got away from the pattern. You know what they did? They made a crackers and juice religion. Crackers. The fact that the modern Protestant church takes crackers, soda crackers, and grape juice for communion may be the greatest example of the kind of religion that they put on. They allow people to worship in. They want people to worship in. It's a crackers and juice religion. We got to wake up tonight just for a few more minutes. I'm not gonna hold you long. But you know what a crackers and juice religion is? &gt;&gt; It's whatever's convenient, sir. &gt;&gt; Right. We just take whatever is convenient. Crackers and juice. &gt;&gt; It It seems good. &gt;&gt; It makes us moral people. It seems like God would be pleased with it. So, let's just do it. So, it doesn't matter anymore. They buy it. I We could do it. We could buy crackers off of the internet that have been reserved for communion. We could or we could just go up to the store and buy the same thing. Or we could buy we could buy grape juice in a little carton and that's what they serve people. But brother Brandham says this. He said, "I do not believe that kosher bread should be substituted for a cracker." Listen, we we could preach on that for a while. I don't believe we ought to substitute the blood of Jesus Christ. I don't believe we ought to substitute the new birth. I don't believe we ought to substitute worship in the house of God. I don't believe we ought to substitute the real and take a form for it. I think we ought to strive for the real. &gt;&gt; Let's strive for the power of God. Let's strive for passion in our preaching, passion in our singing. Let's strive for the word of God to be preached among us. Let's strive to keep it real. &gt;&gt; Let's strive so that our children would be able to lay their hands on the same lamb that we laid our hands on and feel the presence of God and know that that life left the body of Jesus Christ so that they could be healed and they could be saved. a strive for that. &gt;&gt; We don't want a crackers and juice religion. &gt;&gt; We want the real thing. &gt;&gt; How many can say amen to that tonight? &gt;&gt; So, it matters what we take. &gt;&gt; The brand said, I believe it should be holy unleaven bread. The type of the unleaven bread that was made in Egypt, I believe the blood should not be grape juice, but it should be wine. Grape juice sour spoils as it gets old, but wine gets better and stronger as it gets old. Never. If you got a crackers and grape juice religion, it'll you'll be up today and down tomorrow. In today and out tomorrow. Today you're a Christian, tomorrow you're not. But if you can ever get a hold of the wine of the Holy Ghost, you ever get a become a part of the body of Christ by the Holy Ghost, you you you'll always be in the Holy of Holies, living under the light of the word. Listen, he said comm. It's a literal wine and bread. He said, he said communion bread should be made by people who's dedicated themselves and consecrated themselves to God. I thank God for consecrated hands can make our sisters to make communion bread. God bless you for doing that because you've consecrated yourselves to God to be able to do that. And and again, he said, "I went to a church once where they taken this old loaf bread where sinners cursing and carrying on filth and cut up that old bread, stuck it out there with some kind of juice to drink. I think I've told you before, but I remember vividly going to an Assembly of God church for a while when we were kids. We shared our church with an Assembly of God church. And nothing against the Assembly people, but there there's some good people in there, but there was an old man that mowed the lawn. And he'd come on communion night. He wouldn't come any other night of the week, any other service. He wanted to come on communion because he got fed. So he'd come on communion night. He take his old grubby fingers and he'd ride down there on his lawn mower cuz he'd lo had a DUI and he lost his license. and he right down there on his lawn mower and he'd put his hands in there and just grab a whole bunch of them soda crackers and he'd get two or three cups of grape juice and he was so happy and he wasn't happy if you didn't feed him enough. He just liked it. That's not how we take communion. &gt;&gt; Brother said cursing and carrying on and filth and cut up that old bread stuck it out there with some kind of a juice to drink. Brother said it was a filth to God. &gt;&gt; It was an abomination to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said to me that was ridiculous. said, "I believe it should be just exactly the way the scripture said it should be. Not very one speck from the scripture. Stay right with it." &gt;&gt; I know I get this feeling like, "Brother Ben, you're awful stirred up about communion. I believe it matters to the Lord." &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon said, "It's been said by many, if I don't show, if I don't care about it, you won't care about it." &gt;&gt; We need to care about the things of God. Been said by many they wouldn't take wine, regular wine, because that was an alcoholic. It was a beverage and they should not take the wine. They took grape juice. He said the reason we take wine is because the Bible said wine. Huh? All translations give wine. If you go and say Jesus took the cup that was wine, &gt;&gt; right? That is not that's not grape juice. Grape juice wasn't invented. Grape juice sour within a few hours. He said, "But the blood of Jesus Christ gets sweeter and better as the years go by." How many can testify that tonight? &gt;&gt; Gets sweeter and better as the years go by. never sour or contaminates. The man by the name of Thomas Welch invented grape juice. He was a communion steward in a Methodist church. Did you know grape juice was invented for communion? That's the reason grape juice was invented because what had happened is the women's temperance movement had tried to do away with alcohol. And they said, "Well, we can't be out here preaching against alcohol and you guys here in church taking it in communion." So what they did is they they put such pressure on the leadership of the churches that the Methodist church began that that that idea and they put in their creed that they could not use alcohol-based wine. So it's very difficult to make something from grapes that's not doesn't turn into alcohol. It ferments very quickly. And so what they did is uh they changed the formula of it and Thomas Welch goes in he pasteurizes it. He figures out he was a dentist and he figured out how to do that. And when he when he did that, then they changed the formula of communion. Said, "Oh, it's grape juice." It was a good cause. I believe in temperance. I believe in prohibition. &gt;&gt; I believe they shouldn't sell wine on the street. It was a good cause, but it wasn't the pattern. &gt;&gt; It sounded right. It sounded reasonable, but it wasn't the pattern. So glad for a message. It restored us back to the pattern. &gt;&gt; No one can change the pattern. Brother Brandham, like Paul had inspiration. He said, "I received of the Lord." Brother Brandham had inspiration to restore and bring communion back to its biblical basis. Brother Brandham said, "I believe communion is one of the most solemn, sacred, sweetest worships there is in the church service." He said, "And for me, to me tonight, it seemed to be a very special time for me." He talked about how he stood there and was watching. He said, "Usually I'm constantly in prayer, but tonight I was watching the different families to see some of them families has come here since I was a boy preacher standing here with sawdust floors and some of them are new." He said, "But watching the men come with their little wives and family, see how they prefer one another, the sacredness of that, how they watch their children, see the little lady and her hands reach out and think that little hands washed and wiped the tears from the baby's eyes." Brother Bram's getting kind of emotional about it. But he said it meant something to him as a pastor to see them come across the platform. &gt;&gt; Right? He said, "Then I seen the families come up that I've been in their homes when they were sick and the fever children. The Lord Jesus make their children well. I've seen them when they had family trouble. The Lord helped me to get it smoothed out. See, I'm happy again. I got to thinking about our own stories. And I got to thinking about some where some of us come from. And I know what you've been through. And I know many of you don't know everything, but as a pastor, I don't know everything, but I know maybe a whole lot more than most. I know what some of y'all have struggled with. I know where you've been. And when you walk across and take a communion, it does something for my heart. I'm so grateful that God spared your life. I'm so grateful he spared my life. I'm so grateful that we're able to take communion together. Come on, church. It ought to mean something to us. We're still here. We're still taking communion. Yeah, the world's gone crazy. Yeah, we get sick sometimes and get weary, but we're still able to come across here and take communion. It means something to us. &gt;&gt; We've all got a story. I know what some of you have been through. I know what God brought you out of. I know the pit that you come from. But I know the grace of God that made you able and confident to walk across the place today and take communion with full assurance of God. That ought to make us run all across the building. We realize what God did for us, Sister Jane. He changed us, made us new, made us able to do this, &gt;&gt; and I'm so grateful for it. You forgive me for being emotional tonight, but I'm so grateful for the blood of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Can we just &gt;&gt; Can you think about that without it meaning something to you? It it seemed like we get so caught up in the world and caught up in our troubles and caught up with what's going on and we don't even think about what's happening in front of us. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He's still a miracle working God. &gt;&gt; He's still a God of miracles. He's a God that changes lives. He's a God that moves mountains. &gt;&gt; When I see you cross here, it makes me happy. Does something for me as a pastor. I think that's the way God meant it to be. He meant for the stories of the people to grab a hold of the heart of the pastor. &gt;&gt; He meant for for one another that you would know about one another. See other people and and we have a meeting and something that's wonderful. Wasn't our meeting wonderful? &gt;&gt; Didn't you enjoy the word and the presence and that helps us to have all those stories and things that are there? But there's something about the home folk. &gt;&gt; You know what they've been through. You know the area they live in cuz you live in it too. &gt;&gt; You know how hard their struggle is. You know what it's like to work in this area. You know what it's like to be in this area, live here. You know what it's like and you made it. I think we ought to care about other people like that. &gt;&gt; Oh, come on, church. &gt;&gt; If you can't, you know, if you look at your own story, say, "Well, I've always been a pretty good person." Well, good for you. But not everybody has. &gt;&gt; There have been some people delivered and we ought to thank God for it. There have been some people saved. We ought to thank God for it. There have been some people filled with the Holy Ghost, and we ought to thank God for it every moment of the day. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Well, I believe he still does it. Don't you? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I believe his presence is here tonight. I want to hold you much longer, brother M. I've seen the families come up. I just think how it'll be when we go to that great wedding supper. He said, "I'm so thankful the Lord has let me be a friend to you and help you." He said, "That's what I'm here for." And I just think how long how many years about he said I started preaching about 1930 and it's about 32 years for me now. I've been preaching all the struggles and trials looks like though when we come up here it's all forgotten. &gt;&gt; I'm a young man but I got a lot of years behind me of preaching. I've been in this area a long time dealing with some of you folks for a long time and and I know you know listen when we come up here it's all forgotten. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said you seem like there something about communion takes all the twists out of things. taking communion. &gt;&gt; I might struggle. You might struggle. But I'm right with God. &gt;&gt; I'm testifying the blood was effective. &gt;&gt; I'm testifying it did its job. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. I I don't often get too emotional. I don't try to work you up. That's not the way I preach. It's not how I operate. But we ought to be thankful to God &gt;&gt; that we have a time where it takes all the twist out of things. &gt;&gt; Some Pentecostals got the idea of spiritual communion. So we just won't have communion. Brother Brandham dealt with that. The reason he preached a communion service at brother Perry Green's church and brother Perry, I've heard him say that myself that he he had to deal with that and nobody could agree on how to take communion. Brother Brandham had to come in and straighten it out and they still didn't agree on how to take communion. Some of them never did. I was raised, told you before, was raised as a child, unable to take communion because of false doctrine. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm glad. I'm grateful because it wasn't a man that straightened me out. It was the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; I'm grateful for that. He said, he said, "Brother Brandham, I don't," someone told Brother Brand, he said, "This precious brother, he come and said, I never did take it, brother Brandham. I don't understand what it is." Said, "I've been taught the other side." I said, "But remember, we will admit that St. Paul said it in order in the early Christian church, they went from church from house to house, broke the bread with singleness of heart and so forth. I said now he did put it in the church. Galatians 18, if an angel from heaven comes and says anything else, let it be a cursed. You see, the same one that had them to be rebaptized again from the baptism of John be rebaptized in the name of Jesus Christ. He said, you see, there are three things we must do as symbols. The Lord's supper, feet washing, and water baptism. I know people today, and I don't mean to be hard towards people or anything like that, but it grieves my heart. Today, people in the message are told we can take communion alone sitting in our homes, but it doesn't fit the pattern, sir. &gt;&gt; It's not what Paul said. It's not what Brother Brandon taught. &gt;&gt; Right? And and they go in a line and and pick it up and go home and take it. It's not the pattern. &gt;&gt; It's not It's not &gt;&gt; It's not a broken piece of bread. It's not a Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; It's not coming together. &gt;&gt; Listen what 1 Corinthians 11:33 says. He says, "Wherefore, my brethren, when you come together &gt;&gt; to eat, when you come together &gt;&gt; to eat, he's talking about communion because he said if you get hungry, eat at home, &gt;&gt; right? But when you come together to eat to take the communion, tear one for another. &gt;&gt; If any man hunger, let him eat at home. that you come not together into condemnation. So he says it's not a feast, it's a remembrance. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; And the rest will I set in order. He said when I come, &gt;&gt; brother Brandon says then when we come to the Lord's table, we must come in reverence, love, and respect of look where we would have been if it hadn't been for him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Therefore, Paul, he said, I think in saying this, wherefore when you come together to eat, Terry one for the other. That is other words, just wait a few minutes, pray, check yourself out, and if you know a brother is in there just about to do something that's wrong or something, &gt;&gt; you pray for him, too. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But now we have virtual churches, taking virtual communion, never see one another, &gt;&gt; don't pray for one another. I'm not trying to be hard, but it's not what brother Brandham taught us. &gt;&gt; Come on. We're taught to take what? The communion together. &gt;&gt; When you come together, there's no way to do that alone. &gt;&gt; Terry, one for another. Look, he said if you know a brother's in there about to do something wrong or something, you pray for him, too. &gt;&gt; See, people want to remove all the responsibility for one another. But we're responsible for one another. &gt;&gt; See, if a member of the body falls, I'm responsible. He said, you that are spiritual receive such a one. He said in the spirit of restore such one in the spirit of meekness, right? We're responsible for one another. &gt;&gt; We have a responsibility not just to our own families but to other parts of the church. I'm responsible for these young people sitting here. I'm responsible to see that they're raised up into fear. Admon Lord. I know the primary responsibility is their parents but I'm also responsible. &gt;&gt; And if one fall falls away, I have a responsibility in that. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? I know Satan is still fighting and he'll do everything he can to keep keep our young people out of the house of God, but we have a responsibility to do the right thing. Do everything we can to keep them in church. &gt;&gt; We have a responsibility at the communion table to look around us. &gt;&gt; Say, "Lord, protect my brothers. &gt;&gt; Protect my sisters. &gt;&gt; Help them." He said, "If you see one about to fall, &gt;&gt; pray for them." You can't do that unless you're in a group. &gt;&gt; Look, he said, he said, "If there's any feelings between Terry, one for the other." Wait just a minute. If there's any feelings between you or something, don't do it. Go make that right first. Go straighten that up because we want to come here just as pure as we can be. Our thoughts of one another and to God, to each other, and we come in fellowship around the table of the Lord. And we do this because that we are giving thanks to him and among one another. eating the bread between each other. Drinking the wine between each other as his blood and his flesh. Except you eat the flesh of the son of man. Drink his blood, you have no life in you. See, you see that's what the Bible said. Except you do it, there's no life. You're then more or less showing you're ashamed to identify yourself as a Christian. Now, I want to I want to clear something up on this. Just because you missed the communion service doesn't mean you're a sinner, &gt;&gt; right? But I think we ought to strive to be there if we can. Yeah, &gt;&gt; but just because you miss one doesn't mean you're a sinner. But if you refuse to take it, &gt;&gt; right? If communion is offered and you're there in the service and you refuse to take it, you're identifying yourself. &gt;&gt; Right? And if you refuse to take it, then you're saying, "I'm not a Christian." Well, that's okay. There's no shame in that. Become a Christian. &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, I've done something wrong. Make it right. Do it right now." You see, how long does that take? God knows your heart. Take it. It could be like that. &gt;&gt; It doesn't take fair. We should not be afraid to take communion &gt;&gt; because we don't have to take the body and blood of the Lord Jesus in in symbol form. We don't have to take it unworthily, &gt;&gt; but we can take it with a full assurance of faith knowing the blood is still effective and and he died for our sins and we're taking it as he looks at us through the blood. He said, brother Brandon said red through red looks white. &gt;&gt; We are sinless in his presence, sinless in his sight. Amen. &gt;&gt; So thankful for that, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; It's a serious thing. It's uh I believe we have a piano and an organ for the communion. If you could come and getting ready to change the order of the service. It's a serious saying. We want to stay with the pattern. We want to stay with the pattern. It means something. All of these things have a meaning, right? It's important that we keep doing it and not that we just leave it and say, "Well, it's not really that important." And then years go by and we don't take it. It is important. It's time for a checkup. It's a good time to Lord, am I in the faith? Examine yourselves. Paul says he told us to tar one for another. It's a serious thing to stay with the word. Brother Brandham talked about the vision that he had and I referenced it the other night. He said, "Remember in my vision when he was caught behind the curtain of time. I said, "If Paul's people goes in, so will mine." And usually when brother Brandon says this, he'll say, "I taught what I preached what Paul preached." But in this place, he says it in an in an interesting way. He says, "I done exactly like he did." I done exactly like he did. Oh church, let's just stay as close to the word as we can stay. &gt;&gt; Just as close as we can stay for the benefit of our children, &gt;&gt; let's keep our hearts just as pure as we can keep them. Keep our walk just as straight as we can keep it. I say, "Oh, God, help me today. I know I I'm a I'm an example to these young people, an example to these old. Let me remain just as clear as I can be, as clean as I can be, as godly as I can be. If I do make a mistake, let me quickly repent so that my children can see the power of the forgiveness of God's grace. Let them see the blood in action. We bow our heads together. We get ready for the communion service. Maybe now, right now, we can tar one for the other. Pray one for another. You pray for me. Brother Brandon taught us the pastor congregation should pray for the pastor and the pastor for the congregation. [Music] We should not do it out of form. You know, if you get cold towards the house of God, especially towards a communion service, you don't have to be that way. [Music] Let God squeeze your heart. Just let the Holy Spirit in. Give him time. Give him space. Let it mean something to you. Let it be real. See, the the fight that we fight today is Satan trying to make it a form, trying to make it something it's not. But let it be real. real in our hearts, real in our lives, real in our daily walk. The bread is just a symbol. The wine is just a symbol. But the reality, the spirit of Christ, the literal life of Christ in us will make a difference. Could you pray one for another now as I do as well? Oh Jesus. Oh, we love you today. We thank you. Oh Jesus. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] Hallelujah. Lord Jesus, we go partake of this communion service. I pray you'd forgive me, Lord, if there's anything in my life. Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity, oh God. Purge me with hissip that I may be clean. Wash me and I'll be wider as stone. Oh granted, Lord Jesus. Help my brothers, my sisters, Lord, the young people of this church. Oh, as we wait one for the other. I pray, God, there wouldn't be one that would be afraid of the communion table, but that they would know all sin is under the blood. I pray you'd grant it, Lord. We love you. We thank you, Lord, if there's one here that hasn't met you, I pray, Lord, they would meet you right now in the presence, Lord, that is here or you're here to meet them. I pray you would do that. warmed their heart, Lord, as you've warmed mine and warmed these others. We pray in Jesus name. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Let's sing this before we read the scripture. Draw me Lord. Oh, draw me Lord. Oh, don't you love him? Oh, draw me, Lord, &gt;&gt; and I'll [Music] after you. Make it your prayer now. Oh, I need you now. Oh, thank you, Lord. Oh Lord, I need you now. Oh Lord, I need you now. So come and take me away. Sing it softly now. Draw me Lord. Oh, thank you Jesus. Draw me Lord. Oh, please draw me, Lord. Oh, and I'll run after you. Hallelujah. As they continue to play, let's stand together. The brothers would come and do the communion. It's already up here. 1 Corinthians 11, [Music] Paul says, "For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you." Verse 23, "That which the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed, took bread. When he had given thanks, he broke it and said, "Take, eat. This is my body which is broken for you. This do in remembrance of me." After the same manner also he took the cup when he had sucked, saying, "This cup is the new testament in my blood. This do you as often as you drink it in remembrance of me. For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you do show the Lord's death till he come." Amen. Thank the Lord. Lord Jesus, I hold in my hands the bread. So thankful for a restoration of true communion, Lord, both spiritually and naturally to the people of God. I thank you for your broken body which was broken for me. I thank you Lord. Ask you to come and heal. Lord, your stripes were for my healing, for our healing. And I ask you to heal every every disease, every sickness, every every mental trouble, Lord. Every spiritual trouble. I pray you'd heal it today. We thank you for it in Jesus name. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Lord Jesus, I hold in my hands the wine which is represents your blood. We're so thankful for your blood, Lord. Lord, we realize it's not the chemical of the blood, but the literal life of the blood that comes back on the believer, Lord, I pray that every person under the sound of my voice today would be filled with the Holy Ghost. Lord, when we come back together after Lord, at the end of after footwashing, I pray, oh God, that our worship would not be just something we do, but Lord, it'd be from the heart, oh God, cuz your spirit lives in us. So thankful, Lord, for your blood. Thank you for washing us whiter than snow. We pray that you'd bless the people, heal them, Lord, as they partake of the communion. We pray in Jesus name. Amen. Thank you, Lord. Brother Jared directs you. God bless you. [Music] &gt;&gt; After you [Music] draw me, Lord, draw me Lord. Draw me, Lord, and I'll run after you. Lord, I need you now. Lord, I need you now. [Music] And Lord, I need you now. So come and take me away. [Music] I need you right now. Lord, I need you. Oh yes, we do. I need you now. So come and take. Oh, he became me so that I might become him by grace. [Music] He became me so that I might become him by grace. Oh, he took my place so that I through. His love could take his. Oh, he became me so that I might become him by grace. Oh, he became me so that I might become him by grace. Yes, he became me so that I might become him by grace. Oh, he took my place so that I through his love could take him his. Oh, he became me so that I might become him by grace. [Music] Oh, thank you Jesus for the grace that you have given us. And though I can't repay from my heart, I'd like to say that I I thank you. I want to say thank you. Thank you, Jesus, [Music] for the grace that you have given us. Though I can't repay from my heart, I'd like to say that I I thank you. Oh yes. Just thank thank you Jesus for the grace that you have given us. And though I can't repay from my heart, I'd like to say that I thank you. He's all I need. He's all I need. Jesus is all I need. He is all I need. He all I need. Jesus is all I need. Oh, I will worship him. I will worship him in spirit and in truth. [Music] Oh, I will worship him. I will worship him in spirit and in truth. [Music] Oh, and he's all I need. He's all I need. Jesus is all I need and he is all I need. He all I need. Jesus is all I need. Oh, he was there all the time. He was there all the time, waiting patiently in life. He was there all the time. time. Oh, he was there all the time. He was there all all the time, waiting patiently in life. He was there all the time. Oh, he was there all the time. He was there all the time. [Music] waiting patiently. Oh, in line. Oh, I thank you, Lord. Oh, he was there [Music] all the time. Sing it this way. You were there all the time. Oh, you were there all the time. Thank you, Lord. Oh, you were there all all the time, waiting patiently in life. You were there all the time. And I love that man in the middle. Oh, because I know he first loved me. Oh, singing praise to the man who died on Mount Calvary. The middleman made it possible so that I could go free. We raise our hands again and sing it now. &gt;&gt; Oh, I love the man in the middle. Oh, because I know he first loved me. Hallelujah. We're singing praise to that man who died on Mount Calvary. The middle man made it possible so that I could. as we read from John chapter 13 says now before the feast of the Passover when Jesus knew that his hour was come he should depart out of this world unto the father having loved his own which were in the world he loved them until the end and supper being ended the devil having now put into the heart of Judas's scariot Simon's son to betray Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands that he was come from God and went to God. He riseth from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and girded himself. After that he pth water into the basin and began to wash the disciples feet to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded. Then cometh you to Simon Peter. And Peter said unto him, Lord, dust thou wash my feet? Jesus said answered and said unto him, "What I do, thou knowest not now, thou shalt know hereafter." Peter saith unto him, "Thou shalt never wash my feet." Jesus answered him, "If I wash thee not, th no part with me." Simon Peter said to him, Lord, not my feet only, also my hands and my head." Jesus saith to him, "He that is washed needeth not, saved to wash his feet, but he's clean every wit. You're clean, but not all. For he knew he who should betray him. Therefore said ye, you're not all clean. Could I stop there just a minute? He knew who would betray him, but didn't stop him from washing his feet. [Music] So after he had washed your feet and had taken his garments and was set down again, he said unto them, "Know ye what I've done to you? You call me Master and Lord, and you say well, for so I am. If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet. For I have given you an example that you should do as I have done to you. Verily, verily, I say unto you, the servant is not greater than his Lord, neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him. If you know these things, happy are you if you do then. Let's bow our heads one more time. Heavenly Father, we thank you for the privilege of washing our brother's feet, sisters to sisters. Lord, I thank you for that. Lord, you came down and washed the feet of men who weren't even filled with the Holy Ghost at that time. They didn't even know what they were doing, what you were doing. But Lord, you told them if you'll do these things, you'll be happy. So, we're happy tonight to be able to do what you've left for us to do. Lord, may it not just be a form that we do, but may we truly love one another. Lord, if there's any aught in our heart against any person, I pray you'd take it out. Lord, maybe we built up resentment or or some kind of a a feeling in our heart against somebody. I pray you'd remove it right now, Lord. We don't want to be that way. We want to be right. I pray you'd grant it. Lord, we thank you for all that you've done. May we wash one another's feet as if we're washing your feet. We know we are the body of Christ. We thank you for that in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you. The brothers, you may be seated. Uh the brothers will go back here as they're called. The sisters will go to the back. I believe they've got enough back there for them to get started. So the sisters can go on back to the foyer. The brothers will go back as they're called. God bless you tonight. And we'll gather together here in the sanctuary just for a moment when we're done to worship. Hallelujah. He first loved me. Oh, I want to say praise to that man who died on Mount Calvary. Oh, the middle man made it possible that I could go free. Sing it again with all your heart now. Oh, I love that man in the middle. [Music] Oh, because I know he [Music] Oh, thank you, Lord. Oh, praise to that man who died on Mount Calvary. The middleman made it possible that I could go free. Oh, I love Oh, I thank you, Lord. That man in the middle. [Music] Oh, because I know.
