[35:23] those that are in need Lord I pray you'd
[35:26] you you'd help Lord in homes and and on

[35:44] Lord may we learn but not just learn
[35:46] Lord may we receive Revelation father
[35:49] pray that the word that we hear would
[35:51] not be just word because the letter kth
[35:53] but the spirit giveth life I pray you'd
[35:55] grant that tonight that you give life to
[35:57] your children we pray in Jesus name amen
[36:03] amen
[36:06] hallelujah we're going to read from
[36:08] Revelation 81 and then from Mark
[36:11] 11:23 Revelation 81 and Mark
[36:19] 11:23 Revelation 81 says when he had
[36:23] opened the seventh seal there was
[36:24] silence in heaven about about the space
[36:27] of half an hour and then this seems like
[36:30] an unrelated scripture but Mark
[36:42] 11:23 for verily I say unto you that
[36:46] whosoever shall say unto this mountain
[36:48] be thou removed be thou cast into the
[36:50] sea and shall not doubt in his heart but
[36:54] shall believe that those things which he
[36:56] saith shall come to pass he shall have
[37:00] whatsoever he saith amen I pray the Lord
[37:03] with that his Blessing to the word you
[37:04] may be
[37:06] seated I want to speak to you tonight
[37:08] about uh on the seventh seal and the
[37:11] third pole the seventh seal and the
[37:13] third pole there's a reason why that
[37:16] we're preaching on these things and
[37:18] that's because we need to understand
[37:20] these things and there are some things
[37:22] we do need to understand the Bible says
[37:24] that the wise will understand and and do
[37:27] exploits but there will be a people who
[37:30] will not understand but those people are
[37:31] the people of the world and we live in
[37:33] an age when no one understands anything
[37:35] about the things of God but we do need
[37:37] to understand and yet even those things
[37:39] we can't understand we need to believe
[37:42] amen because he said it isn't that right
[37:44] we need to believe those things but I uh
[37:48] there are some things we need to
[37:49] understand I heard a story about a a
[37:52] pastor who was speaking to the young
[37:54] boys the young men in the church and and
[37:57] maybe Jason's age and he was asking him
[37:59] he said uh he asked him a question he
[38:01] said uh who he said' who knocked down
[38:03] the wall of
[38:04] Jericho and uh the boys said well I
[38:07] didn't do it
[38:09] and each one proclaimed his
[38:12] innocence so the pastor went to a
[38:15] deacons meeting later that day and he
[38:17] was telling the deacons he said I can't
[38:18] believe we've not taught our children
[38:20] better he said they they they didn't
[38:22] even know who knocked down the walls of
[38:24] Jericho and and he went on for a little
[38:27] while and finally a wise old Deacon he
[38:29] kind of spoke up he said pastor he said
[38:33] uh he said I I don't know who knocked
[38:36] down the walls of Jericho he said but
[38:38] whoever did it we can pay for it out of
[38:40] the building
[38:42] fund said if it's that big of a deal to
[38:45] you that's why we need to know Ain that
[38:49] right so we don't want to be caught like
[38:51] that if it comes to somebody ask us what
[38:54] is the third pole we should know what
[38:55] that is yes amen who knocked down the
[38:58] wall of
[38:59] Jericho what is the third pole what's
[39:01] the connection between the seventh seal
[39:03] and the third pole and I want to look at
[39:04] those two things tonight what is the
[39:07] third pole what is the connection so the
[39:10] the we know that God Reveals His secret
[39:13] to his servants the prophets Amos 3:7
[39:15] surely the Lord God will do nothing
[39:18] someone say nothing but he revealeth his
[39:21] secret unto his servants the prophets
[39:23] and this is where uh and I don't think I
[39:26] have to
[39:26] restate this to you but if someone would
[39:29] be listening that doesn't understand why
[39:30] we uh we quote brother brandom why we uh
[39:34] believe uh the message that he brought
[39:37] we believe that because God sent a
[39:39] prophet in our hour and that Prophet was
[39:43] to reveal the secrets at the end time
[39:45] and so the things that happened in that
[39:47] prophet's life and Ministry mattered to
[39:50] us because we believe he was a true
[39:52] Prophet we believe just like Moses just
[39:54] like Paul in the Bible that he was a
[39:56] true Prophet now his purpose was not uh
[39:58] to rewrite the Bible that wasn't what he
[40:00] came for it was to tie up the Loose Ends
[40:04] that had been left by Luther and by
[40:05] Wesley and by all the other reformers
[40:08] and he would uh he would show us we
[40:10] would we would know with authority we
[40:13] would know uh what the truth is in the
[40:16] end time and and and the purpose of that
[40:18] was to get us ready for a Rapture that's
[40:20] ultimately why we have a message behold
[40:23] I send Elijah the prophet you he said he
[40:25] said I send you Elijah the prophet why
[40:28] did he come to prepare us for the the
[40:31] Rapture of the church so the bride could
[40:33] make herself ready and I believe that's
[40:35] the day that we're living in I believe
[40:36] we have what we have need of to be ready
[40:40] uh at the end time amen how many believe
[40:42] that we we have everything that we have
[40:44] need of to be ready for a
[40:47] Rapture so we we find that we live in
[40:50] the hour when someone has to answer the
[40:53] question when Jesus said when the son of
[40:55] man come cometh shall he find faith on
[40:59] the earth and brother brandom said you
[41:01] can you can say that when when the son
[41:04] of man comes he said will Malachi 4 be
[41:06] revealed or be fulfilled will Luke 17:30
[41:09] be fulfilled will he find faith on the
[41:12] earth because if he sends the prophet
[41:14] and he did and if he calls out a bride
[41:17] and he did then there will be faith on
[41:19] the earth at the end time amen so that's
[41:22] why uh we listen to a prophet now uh we
[41:25] know that we live in an hour when the
[41:27] days must be shortened for the elect's
[41:30] sake how many knows the Bible says that
[41:32] Mark 13 and 20 says except that the Lord
[41:36] had shortened those days no flesh should
[41:39] be saved but for the elect's sake aren't
[41:42] you glad to be the
[41:44] elect doesn't it doesn't it mean
[41:46] something to you to be the what does the
[41:48] elect mean being the elect means even
[41:50] when you were in your darkest deepest
[41:53] hole in life that you'd gotten you'd
[41:55] done as many bad bad things as you could
[41:57] do and yet you were still the elect of
[41:59] God you didn't know it yet but you were
[42:01] God's elect he chose you and so you
[42:04] couldn't not become a son and so there
[42:06] had to come a day there had to come a
[42:08] day when you when the light come by your
[42:10] way and you receive the message of the
[42:12] hour you were born again your life
[42:14] changed that day had to come it had to
[42:17] come and so uh we find then that uh we
[42:22] find then the days are shortened for our
[42:24] sake except the Lord had shortened those
[42:27] days whom for the elect's sake whom he
[42:30] had chosen he shortened the days what
[42:32] that means is we've come to the end time
[42:34] now there's no more delay yeah so there
[42:37] had to be uh there had to be a presence
[42:39] of Christ there had to be a revelation
[42:41] of the Rapture there had to be an
[42:43] opening of the word the reason why there
[42:45] was an opening of the word so of the
[42:47] word is so we could make it in the hour
[42:49] that we live in we could not be what we
[42:52] are without the message of the hour oh
[42:56] do you love him aren't you glad he sent
[42:58] you a message aren't you glad he sent
[43:00] you a aren't you glad there was a third
[43:02] poll we can say it that way for those
[43:04] that understand aren't you glad there
[43:05] was a third pole aren't you glad there
[43:07] was an opening of the word there had to
[43:09] be or we would not we would just be
[43:11] another Pentecostal
[43:13] Church without the this
[43:16] message so the method that God used in
[43:20] William bram's Ministry was three phases
[43:24] or poll of his Ministry just like he
[43:27] worked with Noah in three polls he
[43:30] worked with Abraham in three polls and
[43:33] he worked with Jesus in three polls now
[43:36] the terminology poll comes from a
[43:38] multi-part vision that brother brandham
[43:41] has around November of
[43:43] 1955 after preaching a series of
[43:45] meetings in San Fernando California and
[43:48] the Lord had always provided for brother
[43:50] brandom and and in the meetings he never
[43:53] begged for money he didn't if you've
[43:55] ever been to an Evangelical meeting uh
[43:58] convention a great convention I remember
[44:00] when we were kids we went to the inner
[44:02] Church Holiness convention and they
[44:04] spent uh I feel like this is feeding
[44:06] back to me brother Peter if you can fix
[44:08] that just turn it down a little bit I
[44:10] feel like I'm yelling at everybody too
[44:12] so but we would go to the inner Church
[44:14] Holiness convention and I remember they
[44:16] they blocked off an hour one night of
[44:18] the meeting it was only a 3 night
[44:20] meeting and they blocked off a whole
[44:22] hour to beg for money and they would get
[44:25] up and they had guys that were really
[44:26] good at it like by the time you got done
[44:28] you wanted to give money I didn't even
[44:30] have any money and I wanted to give
[44:32] money but they uh uh the the guys there
[44:35] were just really good at doing that and
[44:36] and that's what they did in brother
[44:37] bram's time but brother brandham
[44:39] wouldn't do that he refused to do that
[44:41] said if God gives us the money we'll
[44:43] have the meeting and so when he was in
[44:45] California he comes back from California
[44:47] in debt $155,000 now $155,000 for those
[44:52] of you who were alive in 19 uh 1955
[44:56] 1956 that was a lot of money so he's in
[45:00] debt $115,000 for those meetings and he
[45:03] comes home from the meetings and he he's
[45:05] decides on his way back home he's
[45:07] leaving the field he's going back to get
[45:09] his job at the Public Service Company
[45:11] he'll just preach at the Tabernacle and
[45:13] he finally works up the courage to tell
[45:15] his wife and kids about it and and then
[45:18] he gets home and he said this on January
[45:21] 1st 1956 he tells the story he said I
[45:24] went home tired weary upset crying went
[45:27] to bed that night it gives me great
[45:30] comfort that God used a man in our day
[45:31] and not just an angel from heaven God
[45:34] used a man that got weary and upset and
[45:37] crying and he went to bed that night he
[45:38] said after the wife got to sleep I went
[45:40] into the room knelt down and said dear
[45:42] Jesus I don't know what I'm going to do
[45:44] here I am right back where I started
[45:46] from again he said see I guess I made a
[45:48] failure about two hours from then he
[45:51] appeared to me oh my and he begins to
[45:53] tell him what his future would would be
[45:56] in the ministry now uh he tells it in uh
[45:59] more detail about four months later in a
[46:02] message called what is a vision what is
[46:05] a vision and again he tells it in the
[46:08] seventh seal and we're going to take
[46:10] from all those different times he tells
[46:12] it and I'm going to do it a little bit
[46:13] different tonight because I'm honestly
[46:15] trying to keep you
[46:17] awake and and keep your attention so I'm
[46:20] going to read some things that I don't
[46:21] have on the board and you'll just have
[46:23] to catch up with me and then there's
[46:25] some pict back there uh that you're
[46:27] going to have to put on the board as
[46:29] well brother brandom went his vision
[46:31] begins with he sees two small children
[46:35] he pulling a cart or pulling a wagon two
[46:39] small he said brown eyed brown-haired
[46:41] children that he later realized were
[46:44] Mexican children Hispanic children
[46:46] pulling a cart and he said Here Comes
[46:49] something moving and he said I seen two
[46:51] little dark-faced children come moving
[46:53] down pulling a wagon and these children
[46:55] were walking towards him a and uh with
[46:59] their black dark eyes and then he he
[47:01] moves out of that Vision he he he
[47:03] describes it like changing Dimensions
[47:06] now I don't even know what that would
[47:07] feel like but he said it was like going
[47:09] from one dimension to another and he
[47:12] said he goes from uh the vision uh of
[47:15] the little uh Little Children walking
[47:17] towards him and he goes to a vision of a
[47:20] meeting that was dismissed so the second
[47:23] part of the vision was actually meeting
[47:26] that was dismissed without an altar call
[47:30] and brother brandham thought that was a
[47:31] bad thing by the way for those of you
[47:34] who don't believe in alter calls or
[47:36] wonder sometimes why we do it brother
[47:37] brandham in this third pole Vision deals
[47:40] with alter calls twice in this third
[47:42] pole vision and in this first part uh he
[47:45] goes to a meeting and the the vision or
[47:48] the meeting gets dismissed and and this
[47:50] was I think I have a picture on there of
[47:54] the meeting in Mexico now brother brand
[47:55] goes goes to Mexico twice uh during uh
[48:00] 1956 and when he goes to uh uh Mexico
[48:04] the first time what happens is uh he
[48:07] gets um he goes and they get rained out
[48:11] but no one knows who cancels the meeting
[48:13] they never find out and so he goes to
[48:15] Mexico City they rent the bll ring in
[48:17] Mexico City and this is a picture from
[48:19] where they actually went the second time
[48:22] were able to have the meeting and
[48:23] thousands and thousands of people come
[48:25] that's the famous story of the I'm just
[48:28] going to change this mic it's giving me
[48:29] all kinds of problems
[48:32] tonight that's the famous story of the
[48:35] uh now this one's real hot the famous
[48:38] story of the little baby that got raised
[48:40] from the dead how many have heard that
[48:42] the little Mexican baby the mother run
[48:43] up over all the guards and things and
[48:45] comes up front that happened during this
[48:47] meeting so then the meeting uh the
[48:50] meeting was uh uh in Mexico City so this
[48:53] is the next part of his vision and he
[48:56] says later that that was fulfilled that
[48:58] part was fulfilled in Mexico City he
[49:00] sees brother Oregan brigh he talks about
[49:02] how that he comes he passes some
[49:04] ministers and he comes into this place
[49:06] where there's thousands of people and uh
[49:10] and he said it was sprinkling rain and
[49:12] someone said that the meeting is
[49:14] dismissed and he said well who dismissed
[49:15] it no one knew and that literally
[49:18] happened to him a few months later so
[49:21] and and and and they said well what they
[49:23] told him was they said well we already
[49:24] took up the offering
[49:27] and and of course that burn brother
[49:28] brand him up you can understand so and
[49:32] and so that was fulfilled now that's
[49:35] where brother brandom says part of the
[49:36] vision the of the third pole Vision was
[49:38] fulfilled in Mexico in 1956 brother
[49:41] brandom went there and and did that now
[49:43] the third part was a baby shoe now we we
[49:47] don't always understand how a prophet
[49:49] Works do we we don't always understand
[49:52] how God works but if you you say Well
[49:55] that's strange okay go back in the Bible
[49:59] and you'll find prophets doing strange
[50:01] things all the time and seeing strange
[50:04] things candlesticks and and all kinds of
[50:07] different things that they saw read the
[50:09] book of Revelation a lamb as if it had
[50:12] been slain walking out and taking a book
[50:16] right it's a symbol of something and so
[50:19] it's just like brother brandom's having
[50:20] a a vision of a baby shoe but it's a
[50:23] symbol of something and so that's that's
[50:25] an actual 1950s baby shoe Because the
[50:29] Internet is wonderful and you're able to
[50:30] find whatever you're looking
[50:33] for and uh it's a 1950s baby shoe and so
[50:37] it would be something like that he said
[50:39] it was about he said he was standing
[50:41] there with the shoe and a shoelace and
[50:44] he was trying to thread up into that
[50:46] little uh into that little e inch hole
[50:48] he's trying to put a half inch uh
[50:51] shoelace into that e inch hole and and
[50:55] it's just not working and and the the
[50:58] the the thing is coming apart and
[51:00] finally he realizes and he see here's a
[51:02] voice behind him and says you can't
[51:04] teach babies Supernatural
[51:07] things right and he kept trying to do it
[51:09] and he looked down on the string on the
[51:11] floor he said and he realized that the
[51:13] other end would have fit but not that
[51:15] end he was trying to do it wrong and he
[51:17] reached down to pick up the other end
[51:19] and he was taken up again now we're
[51:21] moving we're moving along real well so
[51:23] we'll get we'll get done tonight uh
[51:25] before midnight so we'll be
[51:27] good so he he reached down to pick up
[51:30] the string and he said I was taken again
[51:33] so he goes into another part of the
[51:35] vision right so this is maybe more than
[51:38] what you've heard but it's this is the
[51:39] entire Vision the fourth part he's
[51:42] standing by a lake fishing so I've got a
[51:46] uh kind of a just a picture he sees in
[51:49] the lake a bunch of rainbow trout and I
[51:51] put that picture there mostly for
[51:54] me and I I'll say this right now they're
[51:57] catching some big ones up at the Spring
[51:58] River so just you can thank me
[52:03] later and uh in that next picture is a
[52:05] lake that's Lake Michigan brother
[52:07] brandom when he went to Chicago and told
[52:09] the vision he said it looked like Lake
[52:11] Michigan in the summer is what it looked
[52:14] like so he goes up into and he's
[52:16] standing at this Lake Shore and brother
[52:18] random is a fisherman but the angel is
[52:20] telling him how to fish oh I think we
[52:23] ought to listen when God tries to tell
[52:25] us something the angel is telling him
[52:27] how to fish and so the angel is telling
[52:29] him exactly the way you would fish he's
[52:32] telling him you you cast it out he said
[52:34] when you first cast it out you'll uh he
[52:36] said you'll attract the little bitty
[52:38] fish he said and so you kind of pull it
[52:40] slowly he said and then uh he said and
[52:43] then when you pull it the second time
[52:45] because he's using a lure so he doesn't
[52:47] just leave it there but he pulls it he
[52:49] reels it in and he pulls it again when
[52:51] he pulls a second time he said you'll
[52:53] attract a little bit bigger fish but
[52:55] don't set the hook yet he said because
[52:57] there's more big fish coming after he
[53:00] wanted those rainbow trout right and so
[53:02] he finally he got a he said he told him
[53:06] when you make that third pole and that's
[53:08] where the terminology comes from
[53:10] literally a pull uh it's he's using a
[53:13] fishing rod and he pulls p p l he pulls
[53:17] on the rod and so he said that third
[53:19] pull is what'll catch the big fish and
[53:22] so when he pulls on the rod and and he's
[53:26] standing there and he starts to do what
[53:27] the angel told him but he said a bunch
[53:29] of preachers come around he said he said
[53:31] they were fishermen standing by the lake
[53:33] he realized later that they were
[53:34] preachers he said they come around him
[53:36] and they begin to Pat him on the back
[53:38] and say oh brother brandom you can do it
[53:40] you're oh my you you can you can explain
[53:42] it and so he said okay he said I'm a
[53:44] fisherman and he began to explain to
[53:47] them which is where he made his mistake
[53:50] explaining to them about the gift right
[53:53] because when he explained it to them
[53:54] they begin to try to impersonate it so
[53:57] he began to explain to them about this
[53:59] gift and uh and he said it's because I
[54:02] love people he said I I want him to
[54:04] understand but you can't always
[54:06] understand the things of God and but I
[54:08] we want to understand what we can but
[54:10] there's some things that he had to keep
[54:12] to himself and so uh he was trying to
[54:14] explain this and and when he did it he
[54:17] did it right the first time little fish
[54:19] came when he pulled the second time he
[54:21] pulled too hard and he tried to set the
[54:24] hook he said got a fish but he said it
[54:26] looked like a skin Over The Lure right
[54:29] it was so small you ever caught a fish
[54:31] like that it was so small it was a skin
[54:33] Over The Lure and so when he catches
[54:35] this fish what happens he realizes he's
[54:38] messed up because he's missed the bigger
[54:40] fish but he he finds himself now and the
[54:43] angel begins to rebuke him and the angel
[54:46] begins to say uh begins to say uh he
[54:49] said I give it a great big jerk and I
[54:51] pulled the lure out of the water and he
[54:52] said just in this one who had been
[54:53] talking behind me stepped around in
[54:56] front of me it was the angel of the Lord
[54:58] he looked at me and he said just what I
[54:59] told you not to do and then the angel
[55:03] begins to explain the vision and I have
[55:04] this quote I believe on there the angel
[55:07] begins to explain the vision he said you
[55:09] see that first poll was when you used to
[55:11] put your hands on the people and tell
[55:13] them what was their trouble he said the
[55:16] second poll was when you know the
[55:17] secrets of the hearts like I told you he
[55:20] said instead of keeping that to yourself
[55:22] you tried to explain all about it and
[55:24] tell people people and when you did you
[55:26] didn't know nothing about it yourself
[55:28] and how could you explain it he said
[55:30] you've caused a big bunch of carnal
[55:32] impersonations to rise up and you see
[55:34] what you've done imagine the angel of
[55:37] the Lord speaking to his a prophet like
[55:39] that and I said Lord I'm sorry and I
[55:42] said oh I'm so sorry I don't know what
[55:44] to do and I was pulling the line like
[55:46] this I was trying to straighten my line
[55:48] out he looked at me he said now don't
[55:49] get your line Tangled Up In Those these
[55:52] kind of times now if you read on you you
[55:55] find he got the line straightened out he
[55:58] he mentions that before he goes on he
[56:00] actually got the line I'm so glad that
[56:02] he
[56:03] did so now the fifth part of this vision
[56:08] is a
[56:09] tent and or a tabernacle he says in one
[56:13] place of some kind or a cathedral so I I
[56:17] this is Brother brandom's actual tent
[56:18] that he had uh back in the early days of
[56:21] his ministry I don't know how well you
[56:22] can see that but you can see it's very
[56:24] large
[56:26] and maybe some see some seever a couple
[56:28] thousand people maybe this picture is
[56:31] Jack CO's tent which uh was very much
[56:35] larger in fact Jack Co made sure it was
[56:37] the largest one in the world and the way
[56:39] that he did that he he went to he went
[56:41] to oral Robert's meeting he took out a
[56:43] tape measure and he measured oral
[56:45] Robert's tent and then he went and
[56:46] ordered one
[56:48] bigger sounds like some preachers I
[56:51] know and cuz he had to have the biggest
[56:54] tent in the world they' put that on
[56:55] their advertisements and stuff and so it
[56:58] was the thing to do back then was have a
[57:00] tent and brother brandom talks about
[57:02] that tent and he talked about how he
[57:04] felt himself go up higher he was raised
[57:06] up higher he was picked up he said I
[57:09] never seen he said he saw a great tent I
[57:11] never seen such a tent now he had seen
[57:13] Jack CO's tent so it must have been a
[57:15] greater tent than this tent that's a big
[57:18] tent in fact that tent was bigger than
[57:20] Barnum uh Brothers uh circus tent
[57:25] and he said just then he picked me up he
[57:28] took me up he sent me way up high he
[57:30] said to where a meeting was going on so
[57:31] he's looking down he said it was a tent
[57:33] or a Cathedral of some sort he said and
[57:36] I had just made an altar call he said
[57:38] when I looked there was hundreds of
[57:39] people standing around the altar weeping
[57:42] because they had accepted the Lord Jesus
[57:44] he said and they were just weeping out
[57:46] loud he said and I said oh that's more
[57:49] like
[57:51] it you see why we want to we we want to
[57:54] keep having alter calls till the Lord
[57:55] comes we want to keep the move of the
[57:58] spirit moving in our church till till
[58:00] the Lord we want to till the end why
[58:02] because even in the third pole Vision
[58:03] brother brandom sees it and he says
[58:05] that's more like
[58:07] it I said that's more like it like that
[58:10] we still believed in altar calls and
[58:12] then he sees a long prayer line the
[58:14] longest he's ever seen and he said I
[58:17] looked over what was then to my left and
[58:20] what would be to my right if I was
[58:21] standing on the platform would be that
[58:23] way he said so it' be on over on this
[58:25] side of the platform he said if I he
[58:27] said there's a piece of canvas stretched
[58:29] there in behind this canvas was a little
[58:32] square building about 12T across and 20
[58:35] foot long something like that he said I
[58:37] seen him bring a lady up on a stretcher
[58:39] I've read these to you before and you
[58:41] can go and and find them and what is a
[58:43] vision in the seventh seal and and a
[58:45] couple other places but he said the next
[58:47] man come through was with crutches he
[58:50] says so there was one on a stretcher and
[58:52] one come with crutches and he saw him go
[58:55] through that little building and on the
[58:57] outside the lady come out screaming to
[59:00] the top of her voice pushing the
[59:01] stretcher and there was another lady on
[59:03] the other side and she asked her she
[59:05] said what happened and she said I just
[59:07] don't know she said I couldn't tell you
[59:10] what happened she said I've been
[59:12] paralyzed for 20 years and she said I
[59:15] feel like I was never
[59:18] sick and just said out come the man
[59:20] leaping and jumping with his crutches in
[59:23] his hand he said he heard something
[59:26] moving like it did on the platform and
[59:28] he heard the pillar of fire begin to
[59:30] whip around he said and the pillar of
[59:31] fire left me it went down over the top
[59:34] of the audience and went and stood over
[59:36] the top of that little building and then
[59:38] settled down on top of it and I have
[59:41] this quote he said then when it did he
[59:44] said this one that was standing by me
[59:46] behind me the same voice the Angel's
[59:49] voice said I'll meet you in there and
[59:52] this is the third pole but nobody will
[59:55] know nothing about it now I'm just going
[59:58] to go on record and say that if brother
[1:00:01] brandham came
[1:00:02] back and alive to fulfill this vision
[1:00:06] and came back and set up a tent that big
[1:00:11] we would know about
[1:00:12] it but this third poll nobody would know
[1:00:15] nothing about
[1:00:17] it right so now he said it will not be a
[1:00:20] public show this time right now so the
[1:00:25] third poll was the third phase of
[1:00:27] William bram's Ministry a and he didn't
[1:00:30] even know what it would be but he later
[1:00:32] identified it as the opening of the word
[1:00:34] we all know that the first pole was
[1:00:36] healing he said the second pole
[1:00:38] prophesying the third pole the opening
[1:00:40] of the word the Mysteries revealed so
[1:00:43] what he identified is what would catch
[1:00:45] the big fish oh my come on what what he
[1:00:49] oh my that makes me want to that makes
[1:00:51] me want to run all over the place what
[1:00:53] he identified what would catch a big
[1:00:54] fish is the opening of the word it is
[1:00:58] the word and it's not again letter only
[1:01:00] but it's the word it's a Living Word
[1:01:03] it's Christ made real in our
[1:01:05] hour that's good so it was it was the
[1:01:09] Mysteries revealed now it was also
[1:01:11] identified by the sword that was uh he
[1:01:14] was given in Sabino Canyon and I've I've
[1:01:17] stood there on uh the rock where on
[1:01:19] sword Rock I meant to get a picture of
[1:01:21] that and have a picture of it I meant to
[1:01:22] put one on there and I didn't but I've
[1:01:25] stood there on that rock and in that
[1:01:27] place where brother Bon stood and he had
[1:01:28] a sword now that's a a king sword that's
[1:01:31] actually the uh the sword that they used
[1:01:33] during a coronation uh for the kings and
[1:01:36] queens of England but it was a sword
[1:01:38] like that he said it was real pretty it
[1:01:40] had pearl handles had a guard over it
[1:01:42] had gold and the blade looked like
[1:01:44] Chrome or silver was real shiny he says
[1:01:47] three things about it he said it was
[1:01:48] sharp it was shiny and it just fit his
[1:01:53] hand and
[1:01:55] he said and there was only one the king
[1:01:56] and that's God and he has one sword and
[1:01:59] that's his word oh my he said it's the
[1:02:01] word he said oh what a day we're living
[1:02:03] in what a great thing see the mystery
[1:02:05] and the secret and so he said he told
[1:02:07] him he said something just come to me
[1:02:09] and said Don't Fear this is that third
[1:02:11] pole so the sword in the hand was the
[1:02:15] third pole now I've got this quote uh
[1:02:17] brother B said third pole you remember
[1:02:19] it so he's going on this is in the
[1:02:21] seventh seal he said you've had so many
[1:02:23] impersonators on this what you tried to
[1:02:25] explain but said don't even try this he
[1:02:28] said you remember it how many remembers
[1:02:29] that Vision while it's all over it's
[1:02:30] taped and everywhere it's been about six
[1:02:32] years ago seven years ago he said don't
[1:02:34] try to explain that this is the third
[1:02:37] poll I'll meet you in there so the third
[1:02:40] phase of his ministry the third pole was
[1:02:42] also identified by mountain peaks the
[1:02:45] three uh the mountain range that had his
[1:02:47] name on but there was three different
[1:02:48] Peaks and by three sets of Messengers
[1:02:51] when he saw the vision which he would
[1:02:53] later go out out to uh Arizona and be
[1:02:56] caught up in that constellation of
[1:02:57] angels he saw a vision of of Messengers
[1:03:00] he saw little birds and I've got a
[1:03:02] picture of that I think and it's not an
[1:03:04] actual picture of it but it kind of
[1:03:06] gives you an idea he said the first one
[1:03:08] was little birds he said the second one
[1:03:10] was uh bigger Birds and the third one
[1:03:12] was
[1:03:14] Angels little birds bigger birds and
[1:03:16] angels and he said that was that first
[1:03:18] second and third pole and to represent
[1:03:21] the angels I put a picture of the cloud
[1:03:23] which is the con ation he was caught up
[1:03:25] in which uh was the sign of that in the
[1:03:27] heavens now are you with me so
[1:03:30] far brother Bram taught us he said
[1:03:34] notice the first little flight hand he
[1:03:37] said the second was greater Wier doves
[1:03:39] Holy Spirit revealing the secrets of the
[1:03:40] heart the third flight was Angels not
[1:03:42] Birds angels He said that's the end time
[1:03:45] that's all of it and
[1:03:48] so and I like the fact if you go back
[1:03:52] and and I'm just laying stuff in here
[1:03:53] tonight you go back and study it but if
[1:03:55] you go back into uh if you go back into
[1:03:58] is this the sign of the end sir he said
[1:04:00] he was caught up in a constellation of
[1:04:02] angels how many remember him saying that
[1:04:04] he was caught up he was caught up and he
[1:04:07] says the same thing when he tells the
[1:04:08] story he said I was caught up in that
[1:04:11] constellation of angels and and we know
[1:04:13] that when he gave the third pole Vision
[1:04:15] he said I was lifted up I was caught up
[1:04:19] so when you begin to look at this you
[1:04:20] begin to realize then the third pole was
[1:04:22] also identified by the spoken word a lot
[1:04:25] of people think that the third poll is
[1:04:28] Hatty right speaking or family and the
[1:04:31] spoken word happening that's not the
[1:04:32] third pole that's an identification of
[1:04:35] the third pole right he's showing the
[1:04:37] power of the
[1:04:39] word there's so much more here church
[1:04:42] are are you still with me tonight would
[1:04:43] you be just a little bit
[1:04:45] longer my job to you I is to present is
[1:04:50] to communicate What the Lord Has on my
[1:04:52] heart and I don't always do that well
[1:04:53] but that's what I'm here to do I'm not
[1:04:55] here to make you
[1:04:57] happy right that's not my job my job is
[1:05:00] not to entertain you my job is to
[1:05:02] present whatever the Lord puts on my
[1:05:03] heart and try to present that to you
[1:05:05] where you can understand it so the third
[1:05:08] poll is identified by the spoken word
[1:05:11] and we're going to deal with that in a
[1:05:12] little bit more depth maybe next next
[1:05:14] time that we preach now or next time we
[1:05:17] have a Wednesday night service now uh
[1:05:20] what's the connection between the
[1:05:21] seventh seal and the third pole well
[1:05:24] brother random says this in questions
[1:05:26] and answers after he he relates all the
[1:05:28] supernatural things that have been
[1:05:30] happening all through the week when he's
[1:05:32] preaching the seals questions and
[1:05:34] answers on the seals that Sunday morning
[1:05:36] after he's preached the seals all week
[1:05:38] he said if you can understand it this is
[1:05:42] that third
[1:05:43] pole he said see you should have caught
[1:05:46] that the other day just remember
[1:05:48] there'll be no impersonation like there
[1:05:50] was of the other two he said that's as
[1:05:52] far as you should know now and he tells
[1:05:54] us more obviously later now in
[1:05:57] Revelation 81 we remember there was
[1:05:59] silence in heaven about the space of
[1:06:01] half an hour why was there silence in
[1:06:03] heaven because brother brand said if
[1:06:05] it's spoken Satan would know about it
[1:06:08] and that's what he leaves off in the
[1:06:09] seventh seal and picks up in Christ is
[1:06:12] the mystery of God revealed he said
[1:06:14] there's some things we don't know
[1:06:15] because if once it's spoken then he
[1:06:17] knows about it but he points back to it
[1:06:20] after it happened and said this is what
[1:06:21] took place he said say will try to
[1:06:24] impersonate he'll try to impersonate
[1:06:26] everything that the church will do he's
[1:06:27] tried to do it he said we notice it
[1:06:29] through the Antichrist but this is one
[1:06:31] thing he cannot impersonate there will
[1:06:34] be no mimics to this CU he don't know it
[1:06:37] there's no way for him to know it it's
[1:06:39] the third pole he just knows nothing
[1:06:42] about it he doesn't understand it you
[1:06:44] know what that tells me there will be a
[1:06:46] people that do understand it if he
[1:06:48] doesn't understand there's got to be
[1:06:50] people that do and again I don't think
[1:06:51] it's understanding how to put it
[1:06:53] together but it's understanding it's for
[1:06:55] us yes right it's not it's not how it
[1:06:59] goes together and all the dates and
[1:07:00] everything that's not what we need to
[1:07:02] understand what we need to understand is
[1:07:04] how does this apply to my life how can I
[1:07:08] move into this cycle of the Rapture how
[1:07:10] can I become a part of this third poll
[1:07:13] of brother Brand's Ministry that would
[1:07:14] be so great now and we know that we're
[1:07:17] part of that now and when I say brother
[1:07:19] Brandon's Ministry remember it really he
[1:07:22] was he was presenting something to us
[1:07:25] the first and second poll was to attract
[1:07:27] our attention to something what was it
[1:07:29] for to attract our attention to
[1:07:32] Christ right so we can say it this way
[1:07:34] Christ is the third
[1:07:37] pole right it's the opening of
[1:07:40] Christ the revelation of Jesus Christ to
[1:07:44] the people I'm so glad for that tonight
[1:07:47] he said an inubino
[1:07:48] Canyon so he he he retells that third P
[1:07:51] Vision in the seventh seal he left out
[1:07:53] out the part that happened in Mexico he
[1:07:56] said in Sabino Canyon he said this is
[1:07:58] the third poll and there's three great
[1:07:59] things that goes with it one unfolded
[1:08:01] today or yesterday the other one
[1:08:02] unfolded today one thing I cannot
[1:08:04] interpret because it's in an unknown
[1:08:06] language he said but I stand right there
[1:08:07] and look right straight at it this is
[1:08:09] the third pole coming up and the Holy
[1:08:11] Spirit of God he said Oh my he said
[1:08:13] that's the reason all heaven was silent
[1:08:16] that's the reason what was it it was
[1:08:18] again it was something that they
[1:08:19] wouldn't know anything about but it was
[1:08:21] something so powerful when they walked
[1:08:23] in into the little
[1:08:25] room they were crippled but when they
[1:08:28] walked out it was as though they'd never
[1:08:31] been
[1:08:31] sick can I say it to you this way when
[1:08:34] you come into the opening of the word
[1:08:36] when you come into the message of the
[1:08:38] hour you walked in crippled I walked in
[1:08:41] crippled but when we go through this age
[1:08:44] we're not coming out crippled we're not
[1:08:46] coming out halfway Believers we're not
[1:08:48] coming out as a bunch of as a
[1:08:50] backsliding church we're not a bride
[1:08:51] that will fall we are an eve that will
[1:08:54] not fall that cannot fall so when we
[1:08:57] come through this 12x2 room if you can
[1:08:59] say it that way when we come through
[1:09:01] that little room see it's a symbol of
[1:09:03] something when we come through it we
[1:09:06] come out the other side well as though
[1:09:08] we were never sick in the first place as
[1:09:09] though we were never sinners in the
[1:09:11] first
[1:09:12] place what do we come out with new
[1:09:14] bodies you say where are we at we're in
[1:09:17] there right now oh my we're hidden in
[1:09:20] the secret of his coming and remember
[1:09:22] what the seventh seal was the seven seal
[1:09:24] was the end of all things the seven seal
[1:09:27] was the seven Thunders the seventh seal
[1:09:29] was the third pole and the Seven seal is
[1:09:31] the coming of the
[1:09:33] Lord that's good
[1:09:36] Hallelujah the third poll I want to
[1:09:38] present this to you tonight the third
[1:09:40] poll is not just for the
[1:09:42] prophet it's for
[1:09:46] us he said behold I send you
[1:09:49] Elijah so if there was a third face to
[1:09:53] brother brandham Ministry a third pole
[1:09:56] where he would catch the big fish it was
[1:09:59] for the sake of the fish that he would
[1:10:03] catch oh my if you're fishing no matter
[1:10:07] how good of a fisherman you are you're
[1:10:09] you're only as good as the fish you
[1:10:13] catch right you can have the best
[1:10:16] equipment you can have the best line you
[1:10:19] can have everything just set just right
[1:10:20] but you're only as good as the fish you
[1:10:22] catch brother Brandon's Ministry is only
[1:10:25] as good as the fish he caught but who
[1:10:28] did he catch he caught us and there was
[1:10:31] the supernatural catches many kinds of
[1:10:34] people right it does it even does today
[1:10:37] when we and I believe in a supernatural
[1:10:39] God I believe in the moving of the
[1:10:40] spirit but it catches all kinds of
[1:10:42] people everybody can benefit from that
[1:10:45] the saved and the unsaved and The Sinner
[1:10:47] and everybody else they feel the
[1:10:48] presence of God and that's good but but
[1:10:50] there has to be something that goes
[1:10:52] beyond that something that'll keep you
[1:10:54] something that'll hold you something
[1:10:56] that'll make it where you cannot fall
[1:10:58] right and that is Christ himself
[1:11:01] manifesting the word in your
[1:11:04] life oh
[1:11:05] my brother BR said that's how you know
[1:11:07] you have the the revelation of the word
[1:11:09] by the way is because it manifests
[1:11:11] itself it's not because you can quote it
[1:11:14] not because you can tell tell it put it
[1:11:16] all together but because it manifests
[1:11:19] itself it does what a preacher is
[1:11:21] supposed to do it does what a Deacon's
[1:11:24] supposed to do it does what a housewife
[1:11:26] is supposed to do the word manifest
[1:11:29] itself so the third poll is for us
[1:11:33] brother brandham says this he said it's
[1:11:37] tightening and he could see that in his
[1:11:40] day and I believe that we're in a
[1:11:42] squeeze right
[1:11:43] now I'm not looking for a squeeze to
[1:11:46] come when everybody's going to be
[1:11:49] without power and everybody's gonna
[1:11:51] because I can take you places in the
[1:11:52] world where that's going on right now
[1:11:54] right everybody's going to be persecuted
[1:11:56] and and and we can all be preparers for
[1:11:58] this squeeze I do not believe that
[1:12:00] that's coming I could be wrong but I
[1:12:03] don't believe based on the message of
[1:12:04] the hour that that's coming I believe I
[1:12:06] believe when the tribulation starts we
[1:12:07] go home but the Bible says in in a day
[1:12:10] and hour that you think not they'll be
[1:12:13] eating they'll be drinking they'll be
[1:12:14] marrying they'll be giving in marriage
[1:12:16] they'll be doing business transactions
[1:12:18] Building Homes having Church brother B
[1:12:22] said they'd be having Revival
[1:12:24] people would be coming to the Altar and
[1:12:26] yet the bride would be gone and so it
[1:12:29] happens in that kind of a time but I do
[1:12:31] believe that right now we're in a
[1:12:33] squeeze we're being squeezed on every
[1:12:35] side we talked about it Sunday night
[1:12:37] where there there's Darkness everywhere
[1:12:39] the the there's oppression everywhere
[1:12:41] there's trouble everywhere but I'm so
[1:12:44] glad he said in the time of trouble he
[1:12:46] said I'll hide you in in my Pavilion in
[1:12:49] my tent in my Tabernacle he said in the
[1:12:51] time of trouble I'll hide you brother
[1:12:53] said that was the time of the Rapture
[1:12:55] right so so Bram says this about the
[1:12:58] third poll he said when that time comes
[1:13:00] and the Press comes to a place to where
[1:13:03] you're pressed
[1:13:05] out now what that means is that you it's
[1:13:08] gotten to a place where you cannot
[1:13:10] withstand it
[1:13:12] anymore he said then watch what I'm
[1:13:14] fixing to tell you in a few minutes he
[1:13:16] said watch the third pole then he said
[1:13:20] see It'll be absolutely to the total
[1:13:22] lost but it will be for the bride and
[1:13:25] the church now why would he say that he
[1:13:28] said that because of Abraham Abraham had
[1:13:30] three poles Sodom had three poles lot
[1:13:34] went down to Sodom that's the first pole
[1:13:36] the two angels went down to Sodom that's
[1:13:37] the second pole but the third pole where
[1:13:41] did he go where did the angel go it was
[1:13:44] to the Eternal loss because by that
[1:13:45] point Sodom had been condemned but the
[1:13:48] angel didn't go into Sodom he stayed
[1:13:51] there with Abraham and revealed the
[1:13:53] secret of his heart oh my that's the
[1:13:55] hour that we're living in that's the
[1:13:57] time he began to reveal his secrets to
[1:14:00] Abraham during that time so he said
[1:14:03] it'll be to the total loss but it'll be
[1:14:05] for the bride and the church amen so now
[1:14:10] what is the third
[1:14:11] poll have you been with me so far is it
[1:14:14] you know can you do you know anything
[1:14:16] about what I'm talking
[1:14:18] about sometimes I get done with this and
[1:14:20] I feel like man I had three people that
[1:14:23] thought they got
[1:14:27] it you know what it takes for me is it
[1:14:29] takes a lot of study but it's not just
[1:14:31] that it takes the revelation of the of
[1:14:32] the spirit to put this in your life but
[1:14:36] if you you can't it can't be revealed to
[1:14:38] you until you hear it once you hear it
[1:14:40] then it can be a
[1:14:41] revelation it's got to come from
[1:14:43] somewhere now it can't be real Faith
[1:14:45] until it's mental Faith then it's got to
[1:14:47] sink down somewhere deeper the third
[1:14:50] poll is what the third poll is the third
[1:14:52] phase of William Brand's Ministry the
[1:14:55] third poll is the spoken word or we
[1:14:58] could say it was identified by the
[1:15:00] spoken word the third pole is the
[1:15:02] opening of the word the third pole is
[1:15:04] the seventh seal the third pole is the
[1:15:06] coming of the
[1:15:09] Lord this is it he said those third that
[1:15:12] third set of Messengers was angels He
[1:15:14] said that's the end of all of
[1:15:16] it and that's why we know there's not
[1:15:18] another messenger another message coming
[1:15:21] God didn't do that all of that just for
[1:15:22] William brandom he didn't do that so he
[1:15:25] could pause it and come back 30 years
[1:15:28] later and restart it again or 70 years
[1:15:30] later and restarted again he didn't do
[1:15:33] that he did it for me he did it so I
[1:15:35] could live a a Victorious life because
[1:15:38] the third pole is Christ in
[1:15:42] us that's what the third pole is that's
[1:15:45] what that's what Christ is the mystery
[1:15:47] revealed taught us the third pole is
[1:15:49] Christ in you and so we go back to Mark
[1:15:52] 11:23 where we started he said verily I
[1:15:54] say unto you whosoever shall say to this
[1:15:57] mountain whosoever how many whosoever's
[1:15:59] we got in here whosoever shall say to
[1:16:01] this mountain that means that when you
[1:16:03] have a need you're living in the time
[1:16:05] when there's been a Power released to
[1:16:07] you that you can speak and your mind
[1:16:09] your thoughts will be so with the word
[1:16:11] that you won't speak anything but the
[1:16:14] word on huh well he said you have thus
[1:16:18] sayi the Lord who keep still so you're
[1:16:21] living in the time when when you need a
[1:16:22] new job you can you can speak a new job
[1:16:25] into existence you're living in a time
[1:16:27] when when you need uh those things we're
[1:16:29] living in that time but I don't believe
[1:16:32] that's the ultimate fulfillment of the
[1:16:34] third pole because the third poll is the
[1:16:37] coming of the Lord but listen what he
[1:16:39] says whosoever shall say to this
[1:16:40] mountain be thou removed be thou cast
[1:16:42] into the sea and shall not doubt in his
[1:16:44] heart so you got to believe it you got
[1:16:48] it's got to be revealed to you and
[1:16:50] brother BR said it has to be timely it
[1:16:52] has to be in the line of dut Duty has to
[1:16:54] be something you really need he said he
[1:16:57] shall have whatsoever he
[1:16:59] saith now watch he said so now I'm going
[1:17:03] to say something to you now that I
[1:17:04] haven't said all along and that is the
[1:17:07] thing that we've looked forward to for
[1:17:09] so long he said for at least many years
[1:17:12] four or five years maybe longer the
[1:17:13] third pole has now been Vindicated by
[1:17:17] the spoken word he said I'm sure you all
[1:17:19] know what it is he said now remember
[1:17:21] there will never be an impersonation of
[1:17:23] that cuz it can't be they can
[1:17:26] impersonate discernment but they can't
[1:17:27] impersonate the third
[1:17:29] pole right he said because it can't be
[1:17:31] and that's how we know the third Pole's
[1:17:33] not just head knowledge because they can
[1:17:34] impersonate
[1:17:36] that right he said see it cannot be now
[1:17:38] he said it's
[1:17:40] inexistent he said and I am warned of
[1:17:42] this that soon he said right at this
[1:17:45] time now it's just happened so it could
[1:17:47] identify its presence among you but it
[1:17:50] will not be used in a great way until
[1:17:52] this Council
[1:17:53] begins to tighten up again if we're not
[1:17:56] living in a in a hard time I don't know
[1:17:58] when the hard time is come on I'll be
[1:18:00] honest for a pastor this right now is
[1:18:03] the hardest time it's hard to get people
[1:18:05] to respond to the word it's hard and I'm
[1:18:07] not criticizing you at all you're a
[1:18:09] lovely bunch of people but just ask any
[1:18:11] preacher it's difficult right now the
[1:18:14] the the Earth the United States
[1:18:16] especially just burn over and even
[1:18:18] overseas you don't have the response
[1:18:20] that you used to have and and you preach
[1:18:22] the same word
[1:18:23] under the same anointing and you don't
[1:18:25] have the response you used to have why
[1:18:27] it's the time that we're living in
[1:18:29] there's a squeeze coming down on the
[1:18:31] minds of the people there's Darkness
[1:18:33] coming down on the spirits of the people
[1:18:34] but I'm so glad that we're not relegated
[1:18:37] to that we're not a part of that he said
[1:18:38] AR Rise and Shine for thy light has come
[1:18:41] you can shake yourself and receive the
[1:18:43] word of the hour and believe the word of
[1:18:46] the hour he says but he says it will not
[1:18:49] be used in a great way until this
[1:18:51] counsil begins to tighten up and when it
[1:18:53] does he said the Pentecostals and so
[1:18:55] forth can almost impersonate anything
[1:18:57] can be done but when that time comes
[1:19:01] when the squeeze comes down and I've
[1:19:03] talked to you about the squeeze maybe
[1:19:04] we'll go back into it as part of this
[1:19:06] because I can prove to you brother
[1:19:07] brandom said the squeeze for the for the
[1:19:09] bride he said was not a natural
[1:19:12] force but he said it's it's the it's the
[1:19:15] devil trying to tell them things don't
[1:19:17] matter the word doesn't matter doesn't
[1:19:20] matter if you go to church or not
[1:19:22] doesn't matter if you live right or
[1:19:24] not go look it
[1:19:26] up that's what he taught that the
[1:19:28] squeeze was and I think most of us miss
[1:19:30] that but he said when the squeeze comes
[1:19:33] down you'll see what you've seen
[1:19:35] temporarily be manifested in the
[1:19:37] fullness of its power you know what that
[1:19:39] is you know what the fullness of it is
[1:19:41] what's the fullness of your adoption the
[1:19:43] body
[1:19:46] change you waiting on somebody to come
[1:19:48] and speak you into a Rapture there is
[1:19:51] somebody going to come speak you into a
[1:19:52] Rapture you
[1:19:56] you maybe I went too far but we'll get
[1:20:00] into that next time Lord willing or I
[1:20:02] say Lord come
[1:20:04] quickly I believe you remember down in
[1:20:06] Egypt when they got to they got pressed
[1:20:08] so hard brother Danny they finally got
[1:20:10] to a place where they begin to cry out
[1:20:12] and the Lord said I heard their
[1:20:14] cry there is a people that are going to
[1:20:17] that are going to speak and the voice of
[1:20:19] Resurrection is going to be in them
[1:20:21] there has to be a people but the B said
[1:20:23] that same voice that raised Lazarus from
[1:20:25] the dead has got to be it's got to be in
[1:20:28] US church it's got to
[1:20:29] be there's no promise of a private
[1:20:32] Resurrection for brother brandham but we
[1:20:34] don't need brother brandham because we
[1:20:36] have Christ can I put it that way I
[1:20:38] don't mean that we don't need the
[1:20:39] message anymore we don't need to know
[1:20:41] about brother brandom what I mean is we
[1:20:42] don't need brother brandom to be here
[1:20:45] physically because Christ came and he is
[1:20:49] here amen where he is everything is
[1:20:53] possible do you believe that tonight
[1:20:55] everything is possible nothing is
[1:20:57] impossible he said you can speak to this
[1:20:59] mountain say be thou removed close your
[1:21:02] eyes with me if you would and bow your
[1:21:04] heads I believe now is the time we need
[1:21:06] the third polls musicians
[1:21:09] come now we need the seventh seal he
[1:21:12] said brother Ben we don't need to know
[1:21:13] that I think if there ever was a time we
[1:21:15] needed to know it Now's the
[1:21:17] Time now now we need Christ in his
[1:21:20] fullness and Christ in his fullness may
[1:21:24] not be just a good church service that's
[1:21:25] a good thing but we've always had good
[1:21:27] church services that's something we
[1:21:29] should contend for but we need to go
[1:21:31] through that little
[1:21:33] room and be
[1:21:35] healed because I got a I was born sick I
[1:21:39] was born in sin shaping in iniquity and
[1:21:42] I need to be Washed by the Water of the
[1:21:44] word until not just you know the
[1:21:48] Millennium is a time of change and
[1:21:51] during the Millennium there'll be no no
[1:21:53] there will be no war there'll be no
[1:21:55] it'll be peaceful cu the devil be bound
[1:21:57] by change of circumstance but there's a
[1:21:59] greater there's a greater renovation of
[1:22:02] the earth than what happens before the
[1:22:04] Millennium what happens before the
[1:22:06] Millennium is a minor renovation but
[1:22:09] what happens after the Millennium is a
[1:22:10] greater renovation of the earth when
[1:22:12] Satan will be done away with completely
[1:22:15] and all those that do evil be done away
[1:22:16] with completely don't you
[1:22:19] realize oh God God works with us the
[1:22:22] same way
[1:22:23] right yes we we're we're we have the
[1:22:26] baptism of the Holy Ghost we we have the
[1:22:28] power of God we're sealed to the day of
[1:22:30] our Redemption but these bodies have to
[1:22:33] be changed and this message didn't just
[1:22:35] come to give us a good service or or to
[1:22:38] let us speak in tongues or let us let us
[1:22:41] do those things though I believe in
[1:22:42] those things but that's not what it come
[1:22:43] for it come to present to us a change of
[1:22:46] the body to get us ready for that event
[1:22:49] how does it do that but we got to go
[1:22:51] through that little room
[1:22:53] what is that the opening of the word we
[1:22:56] we've got to feed on it we've got to let
[1:22:58] it be our life we got to believe it
[1:23:00] we've got to believe this message with
[1:23:01] all of our heart if there ever was a
[1:23:03] time I challenge you today believe the
[1:23:05] message of the hour now's not the time
[1:23:07] to begin saying well that doesn't matter
[1:23:09] and that doesn't matter and that doesn't
[1:23:10] matter Now's the Time to believe it if
[1:23:12] there ever was a time to believe it
[1:23:14] today is the day of salvation now is the
[1:23:18] time maybe we should just pray this way
[1:23:21] that Lord would help us to be sincere in
[1:23:24] these things when he showed him the
[1:23:27] vision of the Mamba of
[1:23:29] death show brother brand that Vision he
[1:23:32] said you must be more
[1:23:33] sincere say God help us
[1:23:35] today I need to be more
[1:23:38] sincere I need to be so invested in this
[1:23:43] that I can preach to you something
[1:23:44] that'll that'll communicate to you not
[1:23:47] just communicate justification or
[1:23:49] sanctification or the baptism of the
[1:23:50] Holy Ghost but something that'll
[1:23:52] communicate Rapture I've got to preach
[1:23:54] that in my day and if I preach the
[1:23:56] message of the hour that's what I
[1:23:58] preach I hope you understand the burden
[1:24:01] of my heart today maybe we just pray
[1:24:03] that way Lord help me be more sincere
[1:24:05] help me take it seriously Lord help me
[1:24:08] to recognize my name not live below my
[1:24:10] privileges but recognize what you've
[1:24:11] done Heavenly Father Lord Jesus I myself
[1:24:15] I need to take it more
[1:24:17] seriously Lord I I want to I want to do
[1:24:22] what you you called me to do and I know
[1:24:23] I can't do it in this age or there's no
[1:24:26] surprise to me when when preachers Fall
[1:24:28] by the wayside or even leave the message
[1:24:30] it's no surprise because a man can't do
[1:24:32] it in this age it takes Supernatural
[1:24:36] strength oh God to be a husband in this
[1:24:39] AG to be a father it takes Supernatural
[1:24:42] strength to be a mother of children to
[1:24:44] be a housewife to be to be a an example
[1:24:47] in the church it takes Supernatural
[1:24:50] strength oh I pray God
[1:24:52] as we pass through the message of the
[1:24:54] hour as we go through the opening of the
[1:24:56] word may you reveal to us what we have
[1:24:58] need of Lord may you help us Lord that
[1:25:01] when we come out on the other side we'll
[1:25:03] be able to say like they did in the
[1:25:06] vision I don't know what happened but I
[1:25:08] know I'm changed I don't know what
[1:25:10] happened but I know I'm Healed it was
[1:25:13] like I was never sick it was like I
[1:25:15] never sinned in the first place I'm so
[1:25:17] grateful for that promise Lord so
[1:25:20] grateful Lord that when we messed up and
[1:25:21] done things we can't undo and tied Noss
[1:25:24] we can't untie but Lord we know when we
[1:25:26] pass through that little room we'll be
[1:25:28] changed oh God I thank you for that help
[1:25:31] us to think spiritually Lord not to
[1:25:33] always be carnal about these things but

[1:25:54] by the revelation of the spirit Lord you

[1:25:58] of it that'll just speak to our heart
