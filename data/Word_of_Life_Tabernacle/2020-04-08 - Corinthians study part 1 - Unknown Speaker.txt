daughter Piper that has been sick today bill white camp had mentioned that sister Sharon was sick recently as well and had some problems with her back so let's be praying for her as well and then all the other requests that we've had and all there's many needs so if you would just pray where you're at with me tonight and when we Father we thank you for this time that we get to spend together Lord whether it's live or whether they get to watch it later I pray God that you would just move in our midst and I pray there would be a blessing that would come from this we don't know Father exactly why we do everything that we do but we know that your and so we asked you to come and god I pray that you would just move on behalf of these requests for for Piper and also for sister Sharon I prayed that you'd move for them in a mighty way or they would be physically heal rather than oh there's many other needs that are represented and many requests that have been cine and others that father maybe we don't even know about but you know about them you know what they are so I pray father on this Wednesday night that you would just move in a mighty way on behalf of these people that are listening or watching Lord of our little church god I pray that you would just bless us God that you would move us into the direction that we should go fathers we look at these things in the scripture we know that all Scripture is inspired by you so we asked you to come and and breathe that inspiration into our lives we pray in Jesus name Amen amen god bless you we're gonna read the 1st Corinthians chapter 1 I'll go ahead and read the first nine verses and then we'll go through it Paul called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God and Sosthenes our brother unto the Church of God which is at Corinth to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus called to be Saints with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord both theirs and ours grace be unto you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ I thank my god always on your behalf for the grace of God which has given you by Jesus Christ that in everything you are enriched by him in all other ins and in all knowledge even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you so that she come behind in no gift waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ who shall also confirm you unto the end that ye may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ God is faithful by whom you were called unto the Fellowship of His Son Jesus Christ our lord I want to go over that and it's kind of an introduction to the book of Corinthians I want to preface this tonight by saying that I do not believe we're a Corinthians church I believe that we are in a visions church that's what we aspire to brother Branham teaches us that we must have in Ephesians again and that's what we're looking for in order to take a rapture he says that and the God who is rich in mercy we must have an exodus to come out and to go in so there's got to be something deeper than what the Corinthian church had at the same time I think we all go through a Corinthian experience at one point or another so we're not looking to the Corinthian church as a pattern but we're looking to them as someone as people who are carnal and yet they repented and yet they come they weren't what they should have been in fact they may have been the worst Church of the New Testament that we know of as far as having problems and sins and things in the church but they come out of it and they repented and so we want to look at these things and knowing that the scripture is therefore not just for a rebuke but also so we can learn because we don't want to have to repeat the mistakes that they made we want to be an efficient church we want to be a church and it's not carnal but spiritual Corinth is a church and a carnal state emphasis is a church in a spiritual state I want to highlight tonight that both were Christ's Church Ephesus and Corinth were both Christ's Church they both belong to Christ and we'll see that tonight in Paul's writing we strive for Ephesians but sometimes we travel through Corinth to get there and so we want to make sure that we are going the right direction 1st Corinthians 1 1 as we read said Paul called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God the first thing that Paul does is reinforce his Apostleship he writes with authority you'll remember that Jesus it was said also of him that he spoke as woman had Authority and not as the scribes he didn't just argue about the word but he spoke it with authority Paul writes with because he counts himself as an eyewitness of the resurrection of Christ even though he never met him in the flesh but he met the pillar of fire and brother Branham taught us that we had to meet the pillar of fire not just he said a minister had to meet he had no right to preach until he met the pillar of fire but he also taught us that we as individuals have no right to call ourselves a Christian unless we have met the pillar of fire we know that is the person of Christ the Holy Ghost and so we want to make sure that we have met Christ and Paul had met Christ you met him on the road to Damascus his authority come from his experience and also from his commission that he'd been given so now he had authority beyond what we do because he had the authority to speak the word as the messenger of the age not just any messenger but the pattern to every age after that and we find brother Branham teaches that in the church ages it's it's a common theme with Paul and even with the other riders in the New Testament to reinforce why they have the authority to speak like they do we've been asked us I heard a pastor say one time we've been asked to believe an incredible thing and that said we're going to be raised from the dead we believe in a resurrection we believe as this is Easter week we believe that Christ was raised from the dead and if he was raised from the dead for our so that we could also raise with him that's an incredible thing to believe and where do we get the authority to say those things well we get it as Paul did from our from our Commission as to be the Bride of Christ and also from our experience but Peter said it this way said we've not followed cunningly devised fables when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty in birth Peter 4:11 he goes a little further and he tells us how we should speak of this and he says if any man speak let him speak as the Oracles of God and that word Oracle is actually the Word of God I know some of you are getting having trouble with the internet and that's fine and some of you're gonna have to watch this tomorrow because my internet upload speed is not good but we'll go ahead and go through it and then if you get a chance to watch it go ahead and do that the video should be fine it's just the internet upload speeds not very good so he says if any man speak let him speak to so Oracles of God if any man minister let him do it as the ability of which God giveth that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ to whom be praised and Dominion for ever and ever now brother Branham teaches us that we should speak that way that we should speak the Word of God he said the word this is from the Laodicean Church age the word is supposed to be an our mouth too he said now we know that the church is his body it's here taking his place he said what will it be in the mouth of the church or what will be in the mouth of the church the word and he quotes 2nd Peter 1:21 and then he quotes where it says in the scripture for the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost so we're to have the word as well and speak at the Oracles of God when we speak the word we speak with authority in fact brother Brown tells us that the bride will be the final voyage to the final age under their messenger that's important to remember but the random talks about them in a in a personal thing I'm kind of dwelling on this long I won't take this long in every verse but I want us to understand this we do have authority to speak and brother Branham takes it this way in questions and answers he says these prays that made the men and women that we come in contact with may it be in deep sincerity may we speak of the Oracles of God he said not overbearing but talking wisdom that we might know how to win others to use so I think that's important that we speak as if with authority but not overbearing but with wisdom to know the right things to say and so Paul says called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ and Sosthenes our brother sustenance it's an interesting person the only other time he's mention the New Testament is in acts 1817 and Sosthenes is mentioned there because he's the chief ruler of a synagogue in Corinth and he is beaten because of the Greeks blamed him for some things that happened while Paul was there and so they beat him there but eventually he converted and he was with Paul at this time I think it's interesting because Paul never isolates himself from the rest of the ministry so you can see that Paul always considered himself to be a part even though his ministry was far greater than theirs whatever be as I said we don't know anything else from history or from the scripture about Sosthenes but Paul includes him as if he's there with him riding with him even though we know these things are given to inspiration or by inspiration to Paul so he doesn't isolate himself from the rest of the ministry even though his ministry was greater there's some examples of that and 2nd Corinthians 1 1 if you're riding it now in 2nd Corinthians 1 1 where he says Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ with a little God again a common theme he says and Timothy our brother so he includes him in the in the introduction to the to the Corinthians and 2nd Corinthians in galatians 1:1 says Paul an apostle not of men neither by man but by jesus christ and god the father who raised him from the dead he says in verse 2 and all the brethren which are with me unto the churches of Galatia so paul includes all of the brethren in that and so he's not he's not denying his own authority to speak as the messenger of the age but he is bringing others with him in that all right yeah the livestream is having some trouble but we're working on that all right so so Paul is an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God but yet he speaks with these other brothers these brethren that are with him I think that we have the wrong idea of what a one-man message is a one-man message did not mean to Paul or brother branham what it means to people today and I think it's it's evident of that and we believe in a one man message we believe the message came to one man but then he committed it to other men that her faithful he taught and brother Branham teaches that in the church age but but the ground was asked a question is it true that no one should preach but you you all know this but just to kind of reiterate this is where we're coming to this in the book of Corinthians and he said we they asked him we've seen you ordained men we don't believe you would do that there were not they were not to preach but the Brent says mercy brother sister EVER who told you that nobody's to preach with me I'd sure be a poor subject to God with all that no every man or woman that feels a call of God upon his life get into the ministry and start preaching we need them he says men of God are anointed all over the world to preach the gospel he said see I'm just one little pebble on the beach among many big stones so there's just many more that's more eligible more worthy more of anything to preach to me I'm just one little humble person laying out here one grain of wheat in the old garner Sea so he said you know what I mean he said any man that's called of God needs to preach the gospel so I think that's still true today so Paul had never never disassociated himself never disassociated himself from the fivefold ministry so he writes unto the Church of God which is at Corinth and that is a an interesting as verse to into the Church of God which is at Corinth Corinth is an interesting place because it's known for its debauchery it's known for drunkenness in fact when they would portray a Corinthian on the screen they would portray that the Corinthian was drunk that's the way they would portray and I don't know how they would portray an American on the stage rather screen but when they would portray them they would portray them as a drum so he speaks to the church churches the ecclesia that called out the ones who are called out of the world and it came ultimately to me and congregation it's interesting that the idea of a local church was already formed at this time we're passing notes here so y'all forgive us the idea of a local church was already formed the church he is speaking of the church he's speaking of is a church that would be very much like ours still looks like our hearing that's almost completely down but we're still recording so it would be a church that had deacons it would be a church that had a pastor it would be a church who had or an elder there in the church that would have preached to those that were assembled it would have deacons who cared for natural things they would have taken up offerings serve communion although they did it in the wrong way but they would have cared for those in need provides support for missions there's many things that the Corinthian church would have done that would have been recognized today though it was probably in a house or something some kind of informal place so he speaks to them as a church and he says to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus called to be Saints with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord he says both theirs and ours and so we find the church at Corinth was a sovereign Church and we believe in the sovereign ocol Church but was still a part of the universal Body of Christ there were some places when poet write letters Romans said there were about three congregations in Rome when Paul wrote the book of Romans and yet he wrote to all of them he addressed them all and so he's saying here those that are sanctified to the church so those were sanctified called to be Saints to though and also to those who which in every place and that includes us call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord both theirs and ours so by saying theirs and ours Paul's reminding us that they don't have a monopoly on truth so he's saying I'm writing to Corinth but Corinth isn't the only place that preaches the gospel they're a church that belongs to Jesus Christ but so we are all of the other churches in whatever city they're in or whatever place they're in wherever the people are saying sanctified ones wherever they're filled with the Holy Ghost wherever they preach the same gospel those people are still there and so it's theirs and ours 1st Corinthians 1:3 says grace be unto you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ this is st. Paul's greedy and all the epistles except the pastoral epistles which he has the word mercy it's a remarkable blending of the Greek and Jewish greetings where the Greeks would say grace be to you and the Jews would say peace be unto you and so he blends those together because the church was united and it's a wonderful Greek he said I think my God always on your behalf for the grace of God which he's giving you by Jesus Christ I think this is important because Paul is about to skin the hide he's about to let him know that they're doing wrong but he doesn't discount them as Christians because the book of Corinthians doesn't have anything to do it's a book of Correction it's not a book of punishment but it's a book of Correction and we find that they were corrected and they repented in 2nd Corinthians and you know that's important because some many times we discount churches or people or groups of people because of the way that they act and we've got to remember that they belong to Christ he'll correct them but he'll put them back in their proper place some people would say that Saints would never have to struggle with the things that the Corinthians struggled with I don't believe that because brother Branham tells us that a Holy Ghost person can be driven to do minor things he tells the sentence and answers in questions and answers in 1961 he tells us he said you were at one time there was no battle you were just slopping along as he said but now you've cleaned up now you're in the battle and he said you become a target when you get the Holy Ghost you actually put yourself up a target and so he said if you don't have these these things that you're fighting he said sure he said you say sure nothing bothers me any more he said oh brother I believe you better go back and try again so we want to make sure that we are sensible in these things and know that yes it could happen and yet the Holy Ghost is able to keep us from every sin but the RAM says as soon as you get the holy ghost Satan's got every gun right on you shooting at you and so we've got to remember that that we're going to be shot at we're going to be we're going to be persecuted there's gonna be problems but we've got to understand and know that God still with us and so he said you just move on as soon as you get the Holy Ghost you're gonna get shot at verse 5 1st Corinthians chapter 1 and verse 5 says that in everything you're enriched by him you are enriched by him Christ doesn't come to take away from your life but he comes to bring the riches of His grace into your life and all other ins and an all knowledge just two Greek words and he said you are enriched by him that's logos and gnosis foreknowledge logos obviously for utterance of the word he said you are enriched by this so they had logos they had the word and they had an understanding but for some reason they had a problem making it work they had a problem living it but yet at one time they had been sinners and they come out of the world they had they were the church they were that called out at Corinth they were not a just a worldly bunch of people but yet they had allowed the world to creep back in and so we find in verse 6 that the testimony of Christ was confirmed in them he said even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you in other words you've been saved you had an experience with God you know what it is to meet God you've been there it was confirmed in you it doesn't merely mean that the truth was established among them the people in that area knew the truth but that they were living confirmations of the Apostolic testimony they did have good works they had been taught in different things but they were carnal it was evident that they were Christians but they were carnal Christians and so they were unable to do the things that they had need to do that they needed to do to do the to do the right thing and to live as Christians and to overcome in the world and so Paul was correcting them for that reason now he tells them in verse 7 he said so that you come behind in no gift I'd be something further to be said about a church he said in gifts you're second to no one he said waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ so they had they had they understood that he said you come behind it no gifts gifts of healing tongues all the things that he talked about in the book of Corinthians that another way to put this was you're not conscious of inferiority you're not conscious of being inferior to other churches but you're you believe that you do have the gifts you know that you the Spirit of God moves among you and you know that you're Christians you know you serve God you know who you are but yet you don't have the ability seemingly to live it and that seems like a paradox almost something that couldn't be true but it was verse 8 says who shall also confirm you unto the end that you may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ now look that you may be blameless I like this he says it's a word it's the exact equivalent the word blameless and the English is the exact equivalent of the Greek and it signifies free from reproach brother Branham puts it this way about his life he said that's been my attitude all along he said I want to go out of this world with that same attitude that knowing that some day I will receive a reward if I can only be faithful that's what it's about it's not about how many are with us but can we be faithful if God doesn't count our successes he counts our faithfulness can we be faithful and he says I want to be faithful knowing that someday I shall receive a reward if I could only be faithful until that when the rewards are given Matthew 10 22 tells us that we be hated of all men for his name's sake but he that endureth to the end should be saved that's what I want my testimony to be in the faithfulness and so the Corinthians were corrected so they could be blameless but they were corrected for a purpose and so he tells these Corinthians he said God is faithful by whom you were but whom he were called now if you go back to verse 1 it says Paul called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ of the will of God but now he says God is faithful by whom you were called and so Paul understood that if God was faithful to him to call him out of his obstinance out of his persecution of the Church of God was faithful to him he would be faithful to the Corinthians God is faithful by whom you were called unto the Fellowship of his son Jesus Christ our Lord brother Branham tells us this great creator Savior God is faithfully working amongst his own right now it was the great Shepherd of the Sheep it's very existence as for his own he loves him and cares for them his eye is ever upon them when the word says that your lives are hid with Christ in God it means exactly what it says he says though I'm so glad that my God abides faithful I can say amen to that tonight it's true to himself he won't lie he is true to the word he will back it up he's true to us he would lose none of us but raise us up in the last day he said I am glad that I'm resting in his faithfulness Philippians 1:6 being confident of this very thing he which has begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ and that's what Paul's saying God is faithful even when the Corinthians were not faithful God is faithful by whom you were called unto the Fellowship of His Son Jesus Christ our Lord and so if you're called the fellowship he's faithful to correct you do you come into fellowship that you should for money in this tonight and I trust it and let's just spend a few minutes we've had some problems with the audio and you weren't able to watch maybe the whole thing but through but you'll be able to watch it later but I want us to understand the faithfulness of God even if we fail God as a corinthian church did God is faithful to bring the right kind of correction so that we can begin to live for God because that's what he wants we want to have the right testimony at the end the same one who confirmed it in us when we were saved we want to have that same confirmation at the end so that we can have our reward at the end and that's what we want let's bow our heads again one more time our gracious Heavenly Father is so grateful to be in your presence again and lord these things the storm coming and the internet going out but we know that you're still God father and these things happen for a reason we know that this epidemic that's on the earth today Lord the scientists don't know all they can do is interact Lord from a scientific perspective but we believe in something more we believe there are worse things and death we also believe that we have a healer we have a God who heals all of our diseases yet work sensible with these things and not able to gather together here tonight but but we know that wherever we are you are and you promised you would be faithful to us Lord you would confirm our faith in the end so we're grateful to that Lord as we look maybe in the future as we get these things ironed out it will look at more of the book of first Corinthians I pray God that you would just begin to show us how faithful you are I prayed you to heal every sick person tonight Lord as we go home or go to our rooms or whatever that it is and we go a layer head on our pillow may we know that you are faithful father to heal and to save and to do the things that only you can do I pray you granted now we in Jesus name Amen god bless you but we'll see you on Sunday morning
