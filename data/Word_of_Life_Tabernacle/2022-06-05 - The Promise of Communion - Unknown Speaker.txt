father lord jesus you see these needs that are raised and different ones are that are median body many not able to be here tonight but lord we believe you're still jehovah jireh you're the god who provides everything that we have need of and we're so thankful for that tonight lord i pray that you'd move in a mighty way in this service as you move this morning through your word to tell us who we are you continue to move tonight and just speak to every situation speak peace in the troubled mind lord speak healing to those who need it lord and we believe that you're you died on a cross and shed your blood so that we would not have to live as servants as we heard this morning but that we would live as sons and daughters of the king we claim that today and we believe it we thank you for looking beyond our faults and seeing our need and seeing that we or your sons and daughters thank you for that bless this service touch each and every heart that's assembled together lord may your word be real to our lives lord and as we take the communion may every everything pass away except or our thought of you or may we keep our minds stayed on you from this moment on we pray in jesus name amen amen you love him tonight i know you do or you wouldn't be here on a sunday afternoon to take communion i know there's several that weren't able to be here today and different ones sick and some still on vacation but it's good to have you good to have brother john with us today and god bless you brother john we enjoyed that so much this morning but i'm not going to take much time tonight and then we're going to go into the communion service matthew chapter 26 and verse 29. brother robert good to see you back there today and robert's an old friend he was my neighbor and he come to witness to me about the message of the hour one day and and so we got to know one another because i've come to find out i had already heard about the message and but we we become good friends and he's living in perigold now but it's good to have you and pray the service will be a blessing to you matthew chapter 26 and verse 29 but i say unto you i will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine until that day when i drink it new with you in my father's kingdom amen what a promise i pray the lord would add his blessing to the word you may be seated this evening see we think of communion as a time of remembrance and it is we remember his body and his blood but it also speaks of the future there's a promise in communion that i think we skip over sometimes where he says i'm going to drink this again amen i'm going to take communion with you again in my father's kingdom and he says i won't i won't be drinking the fruit of the vine until that day and so there he's absent in body here now we know if he was talking about a spiritual event he's here in spirit he's here with us so he's not talking about a spiritual event but he's talking about a literal event and i want to turn our minds to that for just a moment tonight that we would look at the promise in communion and we begin to see that he he's prepared a place for us you see it was in a communion service that he he began to tell them that he says don't be afraid don't let your hearts be troubled don't be worried by what's about to happen around you don't be afraid by what the people do don't even be dismayed by what you do he said i've already prepared a place for you notice how personal he is with the disciples he didn't say i prepared it for somebody else but brother john he said i prepared it for you and he said i want to sit down with you i i won't be drinking of the fruit of the vine until that day when i sit down with you and i drink it new with you in my father's kingdom so it's a promise that he made he said don't don't be without a comforter i won't leave you comfort let's go and read in the book of john and he taught as he talks to them it begins to tell them i've got to leave you it's expedient for me that for you that i go away but i'm sending another comforter i'm sending the holy ghost and and there will be a communion that you'll take on down through time remembering me taking and drinking and thinking about the sacrifice that i did for you but there will come a time when you'll sit with me again in the flesh how many believe that tonight brother brown said that's what believers believe there is a heaven amen and there is a literal jesus christ he said he'll come in a body form hallelujah he said that's what believers believe who am i what a thing to look forward to there's several places in scripture that promised this event in isaiah 25 and 6 it says in this mountain shall the lord of the host make unto all people a feast of fat thanks a feast of wines on the leaves of fat things full of morrow of wines on the leaves well refined he said and he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering cast over all people and the veil that has spread over all nations he said i'm going to take away the veil you're going to see me for who i am oh my verse eight he will swallow up death in victory and the lord god oh we'll take this as a promise church you may be going through a hard time right now but look at this promise the lord god will wipe away tears from off all faces amen and the rebuke oh my of his people shall he take away from off all the earth for the lord has spoken there's going to come a day it'll be a reality it won't be just something that we do in remembrance but it'll be a reality and if this moment brother joe could be such a precious time to us as believers if this moment could be such a wonderful in his presence as we gather together and we we take the communion together if this could be such a wonderful time what do you think it's going to be like very bad he'll swallow up death in victory wipe all the tears away the rebuke of the people will be gone oh the accuser will be no more aren't you glad for them verse 9 and it shall be said in that day lo this is our god amen why brother jt because we'll be sitting across the table from him he said well i don't see how that could happen i don't know how it's going to happen but i do know this he said he promised you'd come and i would know him because he'd come in a form like he was then he'll be in a body i'll be able to fellowship with him he'll come in a literal body and i'll be able to sit down with him at the marriage supper of the lamb because that's what he's talking about i'm going to sit down with you in my father's kingdom and drink of this cup amen we'll sit down in communion together and we'll say this is our god and when we do that we're not going to be pointing to a man we're not going to be pointing to a prophet we're not going to be pointing to a pastor are you hearing me today we're not going to be pointing to someone else but we're going to say this is our god who is it the lord jesus christ amen this is our god oh my this is the lord you don't have a right to take communion if you don't believe in christ because that's the very element of it we're remembering the fact that god came in flesh and dwelt among us and and he come down as the son of god and died for our sins and rose again on the third day amen and he made a promise he said i want to eat i'm going to take communion with you amen we're gonna have dinner together some of you all i've been trying to have dinner with for two years and many of you have been to my house but some of y'all you know how it works if you get thinking about there's only 52 weeks in a year you take out time when you're gone for vacation and different things and you kind of have to prioritize then it seems like as a pastor sometimes all you're doing is putting out fires and you don't get to you don't get talked to the normal people very i'm sorry if people don't have any troubles you know you don't you tend to dwell more that's the way you are with your kids isn't it you spend more time with the people that have trouble and that's not always true but but you know i want to there's a desire there i want to i can't always make what i want to happen but he can god never had an unfulfilled desire think about that for a minute run that through your brain he never had an unfulfilled desire if he ever wanted to fellowship with you he will if he ever wanted to take communion with you he will if he ever wanted to sit down across the table if he said i'm going to sit down across the table from you i'm going to drink of this cup with you then he will why because he's more than a man he's god in flesh amen this is the lord we have waited for him he will save us this is the lord we have waited for him we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation jesus talked about it in luke chapter 13 verse 23 then said one unto him lord are there few that be saved he said unto them strive to enter in at the straight gate for many i say unto you will seek to enter in and shall not be able he said when once the master of the house is risen up and has shut the door you begin to stand without and to knock at the door he's preaching to them jews that we're about to reject his ministry he said he's going gonna stand up you're gonna shut the door oh you better while he's still knocking while he's still dealing with you you have to respond then but he said once when when he shut the door and you stand without and knock on the door and say lord lord open unto us and he shall answer and say unto you i know you not whence you are and so you begin to say we have eaten and drunk in thy presence we were with you when you were here and thou is taught in our streaks yes and he shall say i tell you i know you're not which you are depart from me all ye workers of iniquity there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth when you shall see abraham oh my now here's the promise you'll see abraham and isaac and jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of god and you yourselves stressed out verse 29 and they shall come now watch who's going to come because the prophets were buried there in palestine but here comes another group they shall come from the east from the west from the north from the south and shall sit down in the kingdom of god well that's you and me john spoke of it in revelation chapter 19 he said let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife hath made herself ready amen and to her was granted that she should be arrayed and final in and clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints you know if you ask me say brother ben do you get yourself ready for church absolutely but the clothes are supplied maybe i shouldn't let you know this but i don't wash my clothes i don't iron my clothes i don't lay them out my wife does all of that i just put on what she gives me that's what we do as the bride the garments are supplied and the fine linen is the righteousness of saints he sayeth unto me right blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb blessed are they and he saith unto me these are the true sayings of god now we know that last supper was a sad occasion communion is a solemn occasion it's not where we get all happy and usually and jumping around it's a solemn occasion but that will be a joyful place [Music] i've never seen joy like i saw when i was in africa and the way that they worship i love joyful worship i believe when we get over there that will our worship would be more like that here many times our worship is solemn because of the things that we go through and we feel the presence of god and and we sense that we're not worthy to be in his presence but over there when we have a new body we've been redeemed by the blood of the lamb i feel like that our worship will be more joyful and and we'll there'll be more of a shout to it there'll be more of a of an excitement to it why because we made it amen brother brad who said many of them old saints has gone to the grave but one of these days yonder in a new world when they come forth into the promised land the banner of the cross will be over us and will sing the victor song when we sit at the wedding supper that night around the table he said that great table maybe a hundred thousand miles long he said well you gotta you know you gotta have my revelation to make it in just must foreign no more me and my church of four at the big table for just you and year four [Laughter] he said that table me maybe a hundred thousand miles long oh can you imagine it and yet he'll find time to come by every person on that table somehow he'll make it by and wipe the tears off every face he said a hundred thousand miles long with the blood washed saints sitting around there he said i want to go down along the table and shake hands with every one of them just shouting however the brown didn't believe in shouting you see you bust half he said i want to go down and shake their hand i'm going to go down along the table and i'm going to shake their hand i want to shake abraham's hand i want to shake isaac's hand i want to say you know and come in by groups i i just believe that it'll be this way we'll be set together by groups and and we'll go down through the patriarchs and come down through uh through the prophets and go down all through the church and and luther stay in wesley say and finally get down to our days and brother brandon said i want to go down and shake their hands so i want to go down and shake his hand because i'll be able to talk to him then and then i want to i don't want to stop there though i want to shake your hand why do we preach yes why do we why do we struggle why do we keep going why do we face john against adversity why do you ride a vespa a thousand kilometers why would you do that well i go visit the night why go to the places that we go why why i preach like like push sometimes we push and i know you feel like it's a little bit harsh and you think well brother ben you shouldn't preach like they should why do we say those things i wouldn't say those things just by myself but i say those things because i want to sit across that table from you i want you to be there i want as many as they're possible to be there don't you want a good group at that table don't you want your kids to be at the table i want every person here in the church to be at the table i don't want one to be a foolish virgin or be down there in tribulation while i'm up there at the table i want to sit across from them and and be able to talk about the things of god walk along the table i could just i just got a picture of my mind brother branham doing that i want to go to the saints in togo walk down the table and shake their hand say god bless you brother john i was with you i know what it was like but we're in a better we're in a new body we're in a better place ain't no poor countries ain't no we ain't no rich countries like what john said this morning we'll all be wearing the same clothes oh that's the holy spirit now amen that makes us all the same but they'll we'll go down that table and we'll see the saints from other countries that have been persecuted the ones from the dark ages that have been that have been killed and and their babies torn from their arms and all of those things they'll be there and you'll be there and the greatest crowd i believe will be down at the labor to see an end of the table if there is such a thing because there will be a people there have overcome the greatest affliction the greatest adversity 200 000 demons that have been poured out on the earth in the day that we live in all the the demons from hell come out to be poured out on the bride the tape that that place there will be people come by and say i'm glad you made it without us without without you i would not be made perfect amen i couldn't have made it paul will come down there and come to our age and say without you i would not be made perfect that's what the bible says amen said i want to go down and shout you want to hear me shout wait till i get over there he said i ain't big enough yet but john's big enough to child i'm getting there one of these days will all be big enough to shout along with anxious hearts in another place but the random says thank you of the great time are you with me tonight i'm not going to hold you long he said when we'll have the lord's supper together drink the fruit of the vine eat anew of the food and the kingdom of god see that great table spread out for thousands of miles oh i'm going to sit right next to sister fritz because i want to see what she looks like in a 21 year old body a great table spread out for thousands of months and she she ain't gonna miss it she could we can't hardly get her to miss church she's gonna miss it she would she'll be there i believe that i believe many of you will be there i trust all of you will be there amen and he said that great table how the lord suffered together drink of the fruit of the vine eat anew of the tate of the food and the kingdom of god see that great table spread out for thousands of miles all the redeemed of all ages gathered around the table as we look across at each other and shake each other's hands a little teardrop run down our cheek then the king in his beauty she'll come out in his white robe walk down along the table that can't happen you just watch i believe it some things we have to maintain a belief in you can't just subject everything to the reasoning of your mind you won't have anything worth saving after a while won't have anything worth believing i believe he'll walk down there i'm a crier you might have to stay at my table for a while it'd be all right wipe the tears from my face but it will take a while won't it for us just take his hand and i think his presence will just settle us down to the point where we won't have to cry no more i cry a lot in communion services but i've cried in a bunch of communion services over the years normally about my own sin my own unworthiness he'll come by and says say i've made you worthy you're my bride don't cry children it's all over amen enter into the joys of the lord which is prepared for you since the foundation of the world don't it make you want to be there isn't there something in your heart that calls you to that land you see he's not only made reservations but he's made a down payment ephesians tells us that the holy ghost the holy spirit of promise is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession he's made a down payment he's deposited the down payment in you on the reservation for the dinner he's going to have with you and not only that but you're going to drink the new wine he said i will drink the new wine with you in acts chapter 2 and i'm not going to read these scriptures to save time but i'll just kind of go through it it talks about how peter stood up and he said these are not drunk men as you suppose seeing it is but the third hour of the day but this is that which was spoken by the prophet joel and we find that that new wine was to remain with the church in revelation 6 6 he said i heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say a measure of wheat for a penny three measures of barley for a penny and don't hurt the oil and the wine it was to remain even during the hard times even in the darkness of time because brother madam said we find out that it stimulates and it gives joy because it's god's word the new wine stimulates when it reveals the word he said then it brings joy beyond measure sometimes he said we went through that it brings such joy till you get over flooded have you ever been that joyful that you just got over flooded with joy that's why you shall that's why you that's why you worship god because you're over flooded think how full you're going to be when he the person of jesus christ walks by your table some of y'all aren't shouters but i'm going to shout i want to shout just thinking about it [Music] do we really believe what i think people say well these people shout it's just all emotionalism and stuff and i know some of it is but what are you shouting about what are you joyful about i found when people don't have nothing they tend to be joyful because they're looking forward to something amen if you got to a place maybe where you didn't have nothing in this world and the world had lost all its appeal to you you'd begin to look at another land and say there's joy over there there's peace over there there's healing over there there's strength over there there's power over there hallelujah amen i'm almost big enough to shout he said the new wine stimulates brings joy beyond measure you get over flooded i know there's a lot of fanaticism people carrying on he said i know sometimes they do it when the music is jumping up and down and everything i know that ghost he said and i believe that too yeah brother brown had no problem with being happy with the music right that's what he said no that's not the holy ghost that's just the joy that you feel you have to leave time for the word right the word's the most important part but what are you shouting about well you get excited because of the word he said but i've seen people in the day he said as long as the music is playing everybody was jumping and screaming but when the music stopped it stopped he said well he said that that's still all right as far as i'm concerned he said as long as people live right he said but now he said you start bringing the word he said now that's the thing that actually brings life is the word and that brings the joy of stimulation of new wine glory he said yes and that's what it was on pentecost when the word was vindicated what was it they walked out and said this is that why were they drunk they were drunk on the real realization on the revelation of a promise fulfilled what are we drunk on today you could be drunk on the world you could be drunk on the things of the world but i'm drunk today on the realization of the revelation of a prophecy fulfilled what was history is now prophecy the bride revival is going on right now we're not looking forward to it he said well brother ben but you know if he had a bigger church i'd feel more like shouting that's not what it's about i'm drunk on a new wine the new wine oh my it's the revelation becoming reality listen to me we can be drunk on the new wine of this age when we see the opening of the word the revealing of the thunder it's the revealing of the seals right we can see that not coming but already happened we can be drunk on that but one day i'm going to be drunk on the fact that he's standing in front of me oh you talk about revelation i won't have any need of faith you realize faith is for down here well i'm in need of faith you'd just be standing right in front of me see god could stand right in front of you here and you would never believe it most of us wouldn't thomas didn't he'd come in they told him about it said well he finally did come in and then he believed but he said more blessed are they who not seen yet believed he might come and stand in front of you and not know it but yet one day he'll come and stand in front of you if you make it you'll know who he is there'll be a perfect revelation of the person of jesus christ who is god made flesh who is an exact copy as the brother said the other knight of god hallelujah that's who we're worshiping tonight the branham said that's what was on pentecost see we don't need a big band to be joyful when we drink the new wine with him over here sometimes we have to use music to overcome our inabilities or our our the atmosphere of our daily life we sometimes use music to break down that atmosphere we won't even need it over there and i know there'll be music over there but but you'll be in the atmosphere walking with him don't you want to walk so close to him here that you get a little taste of that you see you can't put the stimulation of the word doesn't work in old bottles and you've heard brother branham talk about it i won't hold you much longer but you you've heard of the new wine put in old bottles in luke 5 37 and 38 he said the new wine got to be put into new bottles and both are preserved and he's brother brandon said no that's the way it is today you can't take this brand-new heaven-born pentecostal wine mix it up with some old-time creed some old set in the way died in the wall he said if you do you go preaching about the baptism of the holy spirit divine healing signs and wonders that old skin will try to stretch and it'll blow he said the days of miracles have passed i can't stand it no more i can't even stand through this sermon blow you out the door it goes he said but to put new pentecostal wine you have to have new bottles amen new bottles it's new skin oh my listen when i when i was saved i was born again he put a new heart and a new spirit and he put his spirit down in the middle of it because he said you couldn't even get along with yourself but there's coming today brother john one will be all new body i won't have to contend with the flesh anymore aren't you glad for that brother joel there will come a day when the old flesh had held us down we won't have to contend with it anymore you talk about new wine here he can pour it in us in measure because we couldn't handle it if he poured it all out we couldn't handle it but there there will be a perfect realization there we shall know him as we have been known there will seem as as he sees us amen brother madam said it'll stretch out i'm going to skip past some of this he said think about what it'll be when the full wine is in new bodies ephesians 2 1. you have to quickened we're dead in trespasses and stands do you have you has he quickened what does quicken be made alive just about gone what is the holy ghost the earnest of inheritance the down payment on a future dinner what will it be when you really get all the dividends paid on he said oh no wonder paul caught up in the third heaven said eyes not seen here has not heard neither has it entered into the heart of man what god has for them in store for that love him what will that be you talk about joy unspeakable and full of glory he said you who were once dead in sin and trespasses as he quickened together aren't you glad to be quickened tonight maybe this could be a joyful communion service because we know we've passed from death into life amen we've been quickened by the power of god you as he quickened what's it going to be when you come to he said when it comes to the shadow of the shadows into the shadow the shadow then into the creek the creek into the river the river into the ocean and what is it when you're way out there in redemption with a brand new body you turn back to a young man altogether again won't that be a day for the bill won't that be a day sister friends all of you elders that are here sister karen all of you won't that be a day some of you suffer in your body i know some of you are suffering right now you're hurting in your body but won't it be a day amen when you get over there and you don't have to worry what's it going to be like when you get in a new body a brand new body you turn back to a young man all together again a young woman you're never going to die no more and you look down on earth and think i could enjoy some grapes now watch i see some of us go by way of the grave he says we'll look down on the earth and think i could enjoy some grapes some good cold water i don't need it here but someday jesus is coming and this angelic this theophany i'm living in you'll speak someday and the dead in christ shall rise and that body that i once lived in will resurrect into a glorified body and i'll walk and i'll talk and i'll live and i'll enjoy very bad i know how much brother john enjoys real african food oh i know i enjoy real african food too i like it i also like cheeseburgers but i enjoy real african food it's good you want comfort food your comfort food is usually what you grew up eating and when you get over in a theophany body you won't have any need of that but when you get into that glorified body there will be joloff for brother john that right he said you'll be able to enjoy probably won't be no mcdonald's but we'll deal with that somehow i bet he's going to set up before it's just exactly what we needed what we want live and i'll enjoy i'll live to the eternal ages that is to come through jesus christ our lord there you are brother that's the gospel jesus is telling his disciples don't get too discouraged there's a joy set before you see job got discouraged and jehovah god reminded him about that place he said where were you when i laid the foundations of the earth declare if thou hast understanding when the morning starts saying together and the sons of god oh i skipped part of that all the sons of god [Laughter] sorry i need to act like a gentleman all the sons of god all the sons of god shouted for joy see if you were there your place was reserved by jesus christ himself at the marriage supper of the lamb that's why i don't i don't need no new doctrine i don't need no new messenger i don't need nothing but what already has come to me because that was what got me ready that was the shout out amen the shout the voice and the trumpet that calls me to the wedding supper in the sky that was it together the bride together to go home that was it i don't need nothing new because i'm going home i was there where were you when the morning starts staying together and this is all the sons of god shouted for joy see we look unto jesus paul says the author and finisher of our faith and see he had a joy set before him what was it the promise being able to commune with you the cross wasn't joyful that we're about to remember in communion the cross wasn't joyful but there is a joy coming the shedding of his blood was not joyful but now we can remember it with joy because where there's a joy set before us he sat down at the right hand of the throne of god second corinthians 4 16 for which cause we faint not but though our outward men perish yet the inward is renewed day by day i love this for our light affliction i love the way paul he's in prison by the way he's been beat he's been shipwrecked he's been left with he'd been left for dead he's at our light affliction which is but for a moment work is for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory he's given the imagery of a scale on this side is our affliction and it barely moves the scale and on this side how do you weigh eternity while we look not at the things which are seen but the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal the things which are not seen are eternal how are we going to get there we have to be united with the word by the son of man ministry luke 17 30 even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed but the brahmana said in that day the son of man will be revealed what to join the church to the head unite the marriage of the bride the bridegroom call will come right through this when the son of man will come down come in human flesh to unite the two together he said the church has to be the word he is the word and the two unites together and to do that it will take the manifestation of the revealing of the son of man he said see it son of man jesus christ will come down and human flesh among us will make his words so real did it happen church that it will unite the church and him swan the bride and then she'll go home to the wedding supper hey man she's already united see we go to the wedding supper not the marriage but the rapture is going to the wedding supper when the word here unites with the person and they too become one and then what does it do then it manifests the son of man again what does it do then church i'm closing with this musicians go ahead and come what does it do it manifests the son of man again again he didn't say it would only be manifested once he said it manifests the son of man again not the church theologians the son of man the word and the church becomes one whatever the son of man done he was the word the church does the same thing oh god you may be in a solemn season now but joy is coming psalm 30 and 5 said his anger endureth but a moment in his favor his life weeping may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning amen his anger was displayed on calvary but he loved his own to the end so we prepared a place for them but their name on a seed at the table made a reservation gave the down payment yes sir every head bound and every eye closed before we go to the communion if that reservation has not been made [Music] or you don't know that it's been made for you if your son of god has been made but perhaps you've never come to that recognition that's been made for you i know we're having trouble with the streaming tonight but maybe somebody will watch this once we upload it and if that reservation has not been made you don't know that it's been made don't you believe him why don't you do like the disciples and believe him lord i believe helped out my unbelief believe him that he will prepare a place at the table for you he already has prepared a new body and then do whatever it takes what is it brother ben well you dress yourself with the word become united with the word become one with the word what that means is whenever the word comes i will not reject the word if the word tells me to go to church i will go to church otherwise i cannot be married to him you understand the word tells me to live a godly life i i'll live a god i may make mistakes sure every time i'll fail going to church don't save me living a godly life doesn't save me but i'll do it because i want to be one with him i want to be this i will do it did you say that this evening i will lord i believe you lord i believe you lord i i wanna go let the son of god come down and just drive out all the darkness all the things of the world all the all the little things we get caught up and as we take the communion tonight just just let him take all that away i know there's just a few of us tonight but why don't you just let him take all that away and say lord i want to be ready for my place at the table there will be no empty seats somehow he'll grab a hold of the heart of each and every christian bring them to the place where they need to be at the end time heavenly father oh how we want you lord to come just move in our midst lord lord in a convicting way if need be because we know one day there will be no more tears [Music] or maybe maybe you'll provide us some joy some stimulation of revelation knowing as we see these things lord it just i prepared it several days ago and i got busy and i come back to it today and just my heart began to swell
