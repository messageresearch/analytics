want to look at your face for the bill and just be able to see it there across the table and say we made it we made it brother brandom said if you see me said if you hear the song Amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound saved the wret like me he said I'll be over under the hill he said by the river he said sing an Amazing Grace oh I'm looking forward to that time aren't you amen that's what it means so much when we come together here we expect to spend eternity together over there Luke chap 7 verse 36 I want to speak to you this morning on the worst sinner in Simon's house I know I've approached this subject many times but it just was was pressed on me today to preach this and I just I just want to ask the Lord to help me today Luke 7:36 one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him and he went into the Pharisees house and sat down to meet Behold a woman in the city which was a sinner when she knew that Jesus said at meat in the Pharisees house brought an alabaster box of ointment and stood At His Feet behind him weeping and began to wash his feet with tears and did wipe them with the hairs of her head and kissed his feet and anointed them with the ointment now when the Pharisee would which had bidden him saw it he spake within himself saying this man if he were a prophet would have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him she is a sinner and Jesus answering said unto him Simon I have somewhat to say unto thee he saith Master say on there was a certain creditor which had two debtors the one owed 500 Pence and the other 50 and when they had nothing to pay he frankly forgave them both tell me therefore which of them will love him most Simon answered and said I suppose that he to whom he forgave most he said unto him thou Hast rightly judged he turned to the woman and said unto Simon seest thou this woman I entered into thine house thou gavest me no water for my feet but she hath washed my feet with tears and wiped them with the hairs of her head thou gavest me no kiss but this woman since the time I came in ha not ceased to kiss my feet my head with oil thou D not anoint but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment wherefore I say unto thee her sins which are many are forgiven for she loveth much she loved much but to whom little is Forgiven the same loveth little he said unto her thy sins are forgiven oh my they that said at meat with him began to say within themselves who is this that forgiveth sins also he said to the woman thy faith has saved thee go in peace amen pray the Lord would add his Blessing to the word you may be seated we've heard brother brandham dramatize this story many times and tapes like meanest man in Santa Maria meanest man in town the worst sinner in the city Pride Jesus keeps all his appointments many many times he preached we're familiar with how the the flunky came to Jesus to invite him to the party that Pharisee was going to have how that Pharisee had bad intentions in bringing Jesus to the party to the dinner but Jesus still came because he comes where he's invited aren't you glad of that today and brother Brandon puts it this way he said you asked him to come you invited him to come he said then worship him when he comes oh I'm so glad for that today I I think about last Sunday night's service how the presence of the Lord was so real and and I thought you know I I don't I don't have to run and jump and Shout every service but I Want to Be Free when I feel his presence to worship Him according to the way that he moves on me to worship and I want that freedom to be able to do that I want to be able to love him with all of my heart I I don't want any reservations I I don't want there to be anything that would hold me back from worshiping god with everything that's in me and he was invited so he showed up and when when he showed up to the to the party that he didn't get his feet washed he he didn't get his his head Anointed with oil they they didn't as they would normally do in that country he he they didn't do that for him they actually neglected him and he came anyway and he sat in the corner of the building brother B said he was in the corner of the church in the back corner of the church and he sat there with unwashed feet and he sat there with the dirt of the road and and the things people have been saying about him and all of those things he sat there with that on him and and yet he he he he was able to stay there and in the corner because there was somebody that he was reaching for there was a reason why he was there yeah and the Pharisees went on about their business and and their dinner but there was a little woman who who who had been a prostitute and she'd been someone who all of her life was so messed up that there there was no help for her so it seemed and and yet she'd been in the meeting she'd heard what he said and and she knew what kind of a man that he was she believed that he was the Messiah and so she comes down and she she smells the dinner cooking and she comes down to the place where he is a and she sees him there with brother Danel with unwashed feet and and when she saw him in that condition she brother Harold did just something inside of her she said I've got to get in there and wash his feet I can't leave him in that situation have you ever felt like that you you there might be Hypocrites in the church there there might be people that don't like you there might be all kinds of situations going on but if you could ever get to the place where he is and where his presence is it makes you want to go to the house of God because you know the word's going to be there and he's sitting there and they call him all kinds of names they say this message is a cult they say it's some kind of a a thing that should be done away with but for me it's life for me he is the word for for me he's the same yesterday today and forever let me go where he is let me wash his feet let me be identified with message Believers let me be identified with those who love this message who believe this message who cry out to him let me be identified though they call us Pentecostal Holy Roller or everything else though they call us some kind of a some kind of a name let me be identified with those who believe him who love him with all of their heart oh my good and so she she presses her way through the crowd through all the distractions and disappointments she presses her way through so she can get to Jesus that's what you have to do this morning that's what I have to do to be able to worship him the way we want to the way he wants us to he said there he never moved as she pressed her way through and there just something about about being next to Jesus brother Joel that you just can't act the way you normally do right so she probably made up in her mind I'm not going to make a scene I'm not going to do that but when she got close to him she just couldn't help it she had bought this alabaster box of ointment she spent all the money she had to go and and take this ointment and anointing because he hadn't been anointed when he went in Simon's house so she bought this Alabaster her box full of ointment and she's brought it up there to anoint him and she just can't help it she she just begins to weep as he's sitting there as they would with the his feet behind him and and and she's behind him she's trying to not make a scene but she just begins to weep and and as she begins to Weep the the tears the hot tears fell on his feet I'm sure he felt it but he didn't move because if he' done moved brother brand said she'd have gone up and left but he didn't move he stayed right there and she's s she's there and weeping and as she's weeping it drops on the grime and things on his feet and and she begins to she begins to uh take her took her hair was up and she it fell down and she began to wipe her his feet with her hair and she broke the alabaster box of ointment and anointed him with oil and she's standing there weeping by his side I want you to keep that picture in your mind as we in go into the sermon this morning I want I want to just freeze that in your mind for a moment look around the room who have we got in the room we've got Simon Pharisee Dr Pharisees as brother random calls him yeah we got all the Pharisees the the highest of that day Jesus himself is there we know that Judas is there we know that his disciples are there somewhere around yeah they're all there I want to ask you this morning who is the worst sinner in Simon's house now think about it for a minute who is the worst sinner in Simon's house I'll say this everyone in Simon's house except for Jesus was a sinner everyone in Simon's house except for Jesus was a sinner but who was the worst sinner in Simon's house think about it now as we go on into the sermon in Genesis 6:5 God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually it's a striking phrase and and it sounds like today doesn't it and it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth and it grieved him at his heart and the Lord said I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the Earth both man and Beast and the creeping thing and the fowls of the air for repented me that repenteth me that I have made them but Noah found Grace in the eyes of the Lord oh in a time of leay of seea in a time of of utter Darkness I want my name to be in there but but but Benjamin found Grace in the eyes of the Lord but brother Joel found Grace in the whatever your name is put it there you found Grace in the eyes of the Lord now we know that the Bible goes on to tell us that Noah was a just man and perfect in his time yes did Noah find Grace because he was a just man or was he a just man because he found Grace brother the brandom answers the question for us he said the grace of God reached over in Noah's time Noah just an ordinary man he and his family but because Noah feared God he believed God he said you can't fear God without believing yes he said when then when the fear of God Came Upon Noah God called him by grace and saved him in his house because it was Grace that did it he said not because Noah was a great big handsomer man than all the rest of them he said not because Noah went to the best Church there was in the country you won't find Grace in the eyes of the Lord because you go to Word of Life Tabernacle though I think we're the best church around I I believe that but you won't find Grace cuz you come here to church you don't come find Grace because you say you believe a prophet you don't find Grace Because of Who You fellowship with or who your name is you find Grace because God chose you and he chose to bestow Grace on you and he put in you the fear of the Lord good not because Noah was a great big hands man not because he went to the best Church there was in the country not because he belonged to the best in organization not because he could dress better not because he had more money not because he was some special person but because of the grace of God God saved Noah Grace saved Noah not his works but his grace and also saved his family Paul the Apostle put it this way he said but by the grace of God I am what I am by the grace of God I can be perfect in my Generations or I can walk as a mature Christian if we could put it that way I can be what God calls me to be I don't have to live in sin I don't have to remain in the condition I was in by the grace of God I can live it I know sometimes you struggle and you think well for me there's no way I can live the word it just it's just too hard it's too much for me but I'm here to tell you this morning you can live it or he wouldn't have given it to us in the first place you can do the right thing you can I want to encourage you in that today you said but I don't see a way but he has provided a way you just do the right thing let God do the [Music] rest good you just keep walking you keep coming to the house of God you keep loving him with all your heart you just keep moving forward you can do what God said you can do you can be a Christian in Le but he said said it was bestowed on me his grace was not in vain I labored more abundantly than they all yet not I but the grace of God which was with me oh he said even my labor wasn't because of me it was by grace now brother brandom talks about Sin he said we say sin we just call it sin break it down what is sin remember we're talking about the worst sinner in Simon's house a lot of people say drinking committing adultery no no that's the attributes of sin see that's what sin causes real Sin is unbelief that's where it's named and called out if you are a Believer you don't do those things no matter how holy you try to make yourself and how religious you try to be if you do those things you're an unbeliever that's scriptural listen to John 3:16 and we'll read it and sometimes people neglect to read on he said for God so loved the world aren't you glad he did he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life for God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved he that believeth on him is not condemned are you a Believer today he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God and this is the condemnation listen that light is coming to the world and Men love Darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil so men saw the light and turned from the light and that's the condemnation brother or Jesus rather talks about capernium and he cries out against capernium and he and he says it's going to be worse for Sodom on the day of judgment than it is for you or it's going to be worse for you rather than it was for Sodom right it's going to be worse for you he said because Sodom didn't have the chance that you had they just had Messengers but capernium had Christ himself the word in their midst and he lived right there in the city of capernium and yet they never even noticed anything was going on they touched shoulders with him they they walked near him brother B said that was the great tragedy of the flunky that went down to to ask him to come to the dinner he said it's because he didn't fall down when he had an audience with Jesus he had an opportunity he didn't fall down and say Lord forgive me I'm a sinner it was such an opportunity that he had but the tragedy is he didn't take it he was too busy doing other things right this is the condemnation the capernium saw the Miracles the Miracles that were done and you were done in TI and sight on they would have they would live they would repent Bram said this he said I've passed across this country I've made remarks about Mrs Kennedy with her Jezebel haircut haircut and all like that her big waterheads these women he said I wonder if Mrs Kennedy would have heard the messages I have preached she might have let her hair grow out a long time ago I know you've heard these things before but just just bear with me for a moment he said but I've crossed this country back and forth showing by the word that it's wrong a condemnation for women to cut their hair and Pentecostal women continue go on the same way he said she might rise in the day of judgment not knowing it you ever thought about that Jack Kennedy who invented the Waterhead haircut may rise in the day of judgment knowing no better but you know better Hebrews 4:1 it's a sobering thought Paul puts it this way let us therefore fear let us the promise being left of us entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it for unto us was the Gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith and them that heard it for if we sin willfully after that we've received the knowledge of the truth that remaineth no more sacrifice for sins brother brandom says th thus sayith God's holy word if we disbelieve willfully after we've seen it and heard it then we're across the line there'll never be no more forgiveness for you have you have crossed the line and I've talked to you about that before you how do I know that I've crossed the line it's because there's just no capacity to want to come anymore there's no you don't love Jesus Anymore brother BR said if you still love Jesus then you you haven't crossed the line do you love him this morning and you can say I'm not crossed the line I can come but there is a group that that comes and tastes of it and leaves and they cross the line because they they go out and and refuse to repent yeah but Paul even look at what Paul did and we're going to get back to him after a while but Paul said I did it ignorantly I did it ignorantly we've talked about that how could Paul say he did it ignorantly he had a knowledge of the law he had a memorization of the law he knew the law but he had never met he never met Christ and because he never really met him he said I everything I did before I did in ignorance that's what Jesus said father forgive them they don't know what they're doing what they're doing they're doing in blindness what I did before I become a Christian I did in blindness so it's ignorance Hebrews 6 and4 for it is impossible for those who are once enlightened and have tasted of the Heavenly gift were made partakers of the Holy Ghost and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the world to come if they shall fall away to renew them again un repentance see and they crucify to themselves the Son of God aresh and put him to an open shame so what we're seeing is a picture of sin that it's more it's not so much about what's done but it's more about opportunities that are rejected oh God I'm so glad he's been faithful in my life but I still feel the pull every time I'll be honest with you brother Joe every time I every time there's an altar call every time I every time I hear the train of the himym and and I begin to think about I feel that pull you you need to make sure you're right you need to you need to get right with God you need to make sure I'm a holy ghost filled Christian I'm a pastor of a church but I still feel that pull why do I feel that because there's something say he's still dealing with me he's still making me better he's still he's still working on me oh we ought to take every opportunity we can to come to the house of God and say Lord examine me make me better fix me Lord I know I'm still in a body of Flesh help me Lord I don't want to do what I've been doing I want to do better I want to walk further I want to be closer than I was good I don't want to put him to an open chain I don't want to in this hour when he's so shamed by everybody I don't want to strip him put him to an open shame let me let me be the one who washes his feet thank you Lord amen when the opportunity is given we look around the room if you looked around the room there where Jesus was you might have seen Judas and Judas is the first one that pops to mind you think of the worst sinner in Simon's house but I don't believe he was and the reason is because Judas was born for the purpose of of betraying Christ the Bible says Jesus speaking he said while with them in the world I kept them in my name those that thou gavest me have kept none of them is lost but the son of predition he was born for that purpose that the scripture might be fulfilled I don't believe that he was the worst sinner in Simon's house brother brandham said talking about Elvis Presley and Pat Boone he said they were worse than Judas so there's something worse than a Judas he said 90% of those singing choirs the Elvis Presley and Pat Boon all that tbody Ernie or every what they call him him down there he said it's worse than Judas the scaria again he said Pat Boon those people who claim to be religious rock and roll and twisting and vulgarity of the world then claim Christianity he said why is a disgrace it's worse than the bootlegger it's worse than the prostitute on the street he said God would respect the prostitute better than that so there are worse things worse sinners in the house than Judas who is pre-ordained to do what he did sure Judas left that house and immediately went to betray Jesus but he wasn't the worst sinner in Simon's house Simon probably thought that the worst sinner in Simon's house was The Sinner woman cuz they had been taught never to even touch a woman who had done things like what she had done though some of them may have been secretly her clients but they didn't not they were taught not to even not to even eat dinner with them not to be around them to to create a an air of separation between them and those people yeah I I will say this we do need to be separate but we need to be separate from the sin we need to have enough about us so we can reach to the Sinner and and and Paul or John or James I believe he says he said some saved by fear he said hating even the Garment that's spotted by the flesh he said he said pulling them from the fire there's some that you you have to you can't be identified with what they do but love that person love that person as a church there some things we just can't be identified with but we ought to love people that's what we ought to be known for is loving people amen right just by virtue of the quantity of sins this woman had a great case to be the worst sinner in Simon's house but the random taught us in in marriage and divorce that an immoral woman is the lowest thing that can be thought of in the earth that's harsh isn't it but the Bible says this a virtuous woman is a crown to her husband she that maketh ashamed is as rottenness in his bones I'll say this this woman brother B said there's something about women that he said they catch it quicker than men do that's an actual quote said they catch it quicker than men do catch the spirit or something there's something about women and and this woman did in in Simon's house so she is not oh my she is not the worst sinner in Simon's house in fact she is the heroin of the story by the end as we read earlier all of her sins oh that's what I once said about me I don't care who knows what about me I just want him to say all of my sins have been washed away you see God didn't care about her past yeah that's right right he wasn't looking at what she had done that's right oh God you know there there are seeds that you can sew in life that must be harvested did you know that and that's why we try so hard to get people not to make bad decisions because when you do that you go against the word we know what the result of that's going to be those seeds must be harvested they will be harvested in your life but if you're a child of God from the beginning yes there is nothing that you can do that will change that fact right Hallelujah no matter how much pig that the prodal son got on him he would never be a pig he might smell like a pig he might eat like a pig he might have been out with the pigs he might be doing everything that the pig was doing but he would never be a pig when he come to himself he said even the servants do better than I'm doing what was it he could not be a pig he was a son oh we might smell like a cner we might have everything going on you might have everything going on in your life that's wrong this morning but you can never be if you're being called by God God's coming to get you he's going to get a hold of you he's coming to get you that's why I believe the backsliders are coming home that's why I believe that the out people that have been out maybe for years are beginning to come back to the house of God why because I know if there's a seat of God there we're nearing the end it's time to come home you cannot you cannot do anything that can take you away from being a son or daughter of god good right Hallelujah come on the truth is some of God's children get involved in a horrible things but they do not remain in the pit right I hope you're hearing me this morning said brother Ben who you preaching I'm preaching it me you're going to see why in a minute if you have eternal life brother brand said you always was there's only one form of it that's God he said God's own life Zoe you were his attribute he thought of you and knew you before the foundation of the world yeah look at the woman at the well brother BR said she looked around look what a sinful shape she was in but see he couldn't get that priest because the priest was an educated scholar a theologian in the word but no representation in Heaven Wasn't in God's thinking at all but this woman was she said sir I perceive that you are a prophet he said that's just all he wanted her to see oh my look at that little woman he said again speaking of the woman at the well he said she had fallen from God's thoughts she could be redeemed yeah and I'll say this that none of us he will not force us to choose him right but he will overwhelm us thank you Lord all right right some of us had to fall far enough yeah that we could feel the overwhelming grace of God when he come and ask said you're still a child that's right that's right that's right amen thank you Lord all right oh God come on some of us had to had to fall so far into the pit that couldn't get out on her own effort and he had to reach now I said now you can see that's right oh now you can see you're still here and I'll say this to some of you I know some of us some of you have have fallen so far and some of you have done things that you wish you'd never done and wish you could change your story but you had to fall to a place where you could recognize he's your savior and he still loves you and he still cares about you you're still his child that's right that's that's right amen thank thank you Lord Brother Bram looked at that little woman she hadd fallen from God's thought she could be redeemed she was a subject she had representation in heaven she turned around thank you Lord the priest could not turn around Judas could not turn around but she turned around oh God her life was complete and total darkness but when she met Jesus everything changed Hallelujah I think I have a picture of this and I may have showed this to you before Jonathan do you recognize that that's on 71 highway going to you can find a picture on the internet going up Joel you you remember that it's on the side of the road going to maybe north of neveda going towards Rich Hill but it's on the it's on the right side of the road I remember seeing that growing up and one time I I drove by and I saw that P or that that Silo with a tree inside it and I thought of all the place places for a tree to grow you know that seed waited a long time to get enough light to be able to come out of the ground there's no trees around it there's no no one ever planted it and this is a thing by the way Silo trees there was nothing around it and they've cut all the trees around it they've it's just a flat field if you've ever been back home back where we come from it's all flat and and there's there was no trees around it how did the tree grow like that to be in The Silo and if you actually go into that Silo I've not been inside this one but I've seen pictures taken inside of them that actually there's no branches or anything inside The Silo that the tree is just a straight trunk and at the top it spreads out the tree has learned to to grow inside of a silo that that seed had to wait it it had it was covered over it had a roof over it it had a farmer dumping Grain on top of of it you ever felt like that it had everything in the world but the herald against it but when it got some rest yeah and finally the roof rotted off and the grain kept quit being dumped in there and it finally reached a place in its life that it could begin to begin to think about things as we would say it it began to receive warmth it couldn't receive warmth so it never Bloss aome but it finally began to receive warmth and one day it began to come up and over the years it come up and finally it come up to where you could see what it was and it actually fulfilled its purpose listen many of us were like that seed planted in a silo we were born in sin shapen in iniquity we could not receive the truth but we had to wait until everything was rotted away we had to wait until we could receive light and one day we grabbed a hold of it and when we grabbed a hold of it we became as much a tree as any other tree in the [Applause] [Music] field brother BR said that little Pond Lily look where it come through dirt mck mud Muddy Waters dirty Waters if you if you'll I preached on that one time if you actually go through that there there's a process dirt muck mud it's getting more and more warmth and light as it goes up dirt muck mud Muddy Waters dirty Waters and then one day pops up above it you remember that that day am that's good one day it just pops up above it it never could feel the Sun and receive the nutrients from the rain and the sun like it ought to until the day it came up above the muck and the Muddy Waters and the dirty Waters don't don't be discouraged because it's taking some time to get you where you're at that's just the Journey of the seed it's just the process of life this little germ of Life working itself from the bottom of the pond where the frogs and things are at and then brings itself up through all of that but when it gets in the presence of the sun it's born the little seed burst open into life it cannot do that until it oh God it cannot do that until it goes through all that process it's got to come through that that's what makes it and many times we think we look back and we think why did I have to go through what I went through that's what makes it is because the sun itself is what's drawing it and when it gets fully above all the dirty Waters and muck and so forth then it's so happy amen it just gives life out freely and it's a beautiful thing when it gets in the presence of that which is drawing up oh I can say Amen to that this morning that's good so if Judas wasn't the worst Sinner and I don't have time to go through each and every one we could go through the footwash funky you had an opportunity and didn't receive it he had better things to do there's many others that were there we could go through all of them but if Judas wasn't the worst sinner the woman wasn't the worst sinner we know Jes Jesus never sinned who was the worst sinner in Simon's house brother Brandon maners the question for us he said oh what about Pharisee yeah come on he said oh the the party stopped when she began to wash his feet the party stopped sure the embarrassment and somebody tell me the other day said well they'll learn better one day I hope they never do come on well they they're disruptive in church they'll learn better someday I hope we just get out of order enough to get saved yeah he said oh the party stopped the embarrassment oh I can see that Pharisee there's a sinner not the woman the FY Oh my he titled that summer the worst sinner in the city yeah not just in the house but in the city and Simon standing there thinking oh I've let sinners in my house yeah and some of y'all sit in church and you think well oh my I can't believe we let sinners in the church Preach there must we need to put a mirror on the wall when we come in come on that's right stand there and say I can't believe you we let you come in that's right glad y'all let me come to church there's The Sinner say was the worst sinner in the city not the woman oh my oh my he said the Pharisees sin is unbelief that woman was a Believer yes Hallelujah he said the Pharisee was all religious but he was the worst sinner in the country and it's still the worst sinner the world has got is a stiffy starch backsliding church people take comfort in their Church well it they do this that and the other for God but are they willing to surrender to the word are you willing to surrender to what the word says so of making up some denominational idea or Creed good said still this worst center of the world's got a stiffy starch backsliding Church the pastor the same way oh I preaching it myself I don't believe we're a stiffy starch backslid in church but we don't want to ever be that he said you'll hate me after this but God's the one that's telling me to say it so there it is he said that's the sinner a stuan that's right that's good the Bible tells us he was a Pharisee from his youth he was trained to do everything Moses taught plus the tradition of the elders he did more than he had to do and he was so proud that he didn't have a Christmas tree I mean he he they would drop an article of clothing on on Sabbath day they they wouldn't transgress the law so they made up Creeds to go around the laws does it sound familiar I wish people would just surrender to the word he said but it's me that it catches that's fine just acknowledge the word is right and move on he's still a savior he still has Grace for The Sinner he still wants you yes but you got to be willing to acknowledge the truth they would drop articles of clothing every so far because they can only go so far on a Sabbath day and they call that their house they put a chair down about one mile only go one mile on the Sabbath days they put a chair down there and they have a a flunky run on ahead of them so they could keep the law and still do whatever they wanted to do Pharisee he'd been trained in the message he learned to keep his house clean of people like The Sinner woman the word Pharisee today carries a negative connotation but in jesus' time they would have been respected for their Holiness they were the best the closest to the truth Paul put it this way CU he had been one he said though I might also have confidence in the flesh he said if any other man thinketh yet whereof he might Trust In the Flesh I more he said circumcised The Eighth Day of the stock of Israel of The Tribe of Benjamin a Hebrew of the Hebrews as touching the law of Pharisee concerning Zeal persecuting the church touching the righteousness which is in the law blameless sir I remember you probably remember there was a lady got up in our church a Holiness lady one time when I was a kid I never forget her testimony her testimony was I've always been a good girl well remember Donald Trump not prot Trump or against Trump but I remember back in the 2016 campaign he said well I not really done anything to be forgiven of oh God help us today We Know Better Don't We concerning Zeal persecuting the church touching the righteousness which is in the law blameless Jesus tells us how they lived Matthew 5:24 I say to you that except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees you shall in no case enter into the Kingdom of Heaven Matthew 23:23 woe unto you scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites for you pay tithe of mint and anise and cumin well tell you what I put you what you know what the secret to good chile is you didn't think you was going to hear this today but you are you know what the secret to good chile is when they get that little bottle of cumin that they sell the store dump it all in the whole bottle you'll thank me later I have never paid Ties on that I give away more than I keep and I'm glad I'm able to do that church but glad you you make me able to do that I I I appreciate that so much but I've never paid tithe on on cumin they did but you said he said you've omitted the the weightier matters of the law yes judgment mercy and Faith these ought you to have done not to leave the other undone right he said you blind guides which strain at a n and swallow a camel it's pretty descriptive w't you scribe and Pharisees Hypocrites you may clean the outside of the cup and the platter but within they're full of extortion and excess th blind fisy he cleanse first that which is within the cup and the platter that the outside of them may be clean also yes woe unto you scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites for you're like ined septo curse which are indeed appear beautiful outward but are within full of dead men's bones and of all uncleanness even so you also outwardly appear righteous un men but within your full of hypocrisy and iniquity you know one of the marks of phariseeism is to publicize the sins of others and hide your own I'll be honest with you I've been around this area for here for years but since moving here I I found a a a large a large portion of of people who are of my former persuasion a lot of recovering Pharisees and some who need to recover amen Pharisees were grateful not for Mercy but for their own righteousness you find that with the woman caught in adultery when they caught her in the act of adultery but never even thought to question who the guy was but they caught her and so they were going to Stone her and Jesus just draws in the sand I don't know what he drew but it was something made him think he looks up he says which among you haven't sinned cast the first stone the person who without sin because you're all worthy of death right and the oldest had the most sense so they left first and the youngest stood there still clutching their Stones looking around saying you know what I better join them at the altar that's right it's good oh God he said you're inside you're full of hypocrisy and iniquity he looked up at the woman he said he said do you don't have any accusers she said none said neither do I condemn thee go sin no more don't do it again don't do it again God help us today that's what brother bandam tells us he said he said don't do it again but God is giving you Grace that's good Luke 18 and10 and just bear with me a moment I I don't know why I the Lord laid this on my heart this morning but I I believe it's for me I believe it's for me as I said I was one of those Luke 18 and 10 two men went up in the temple to pray the one a Pharisee the other a Publican the Pharisees stood and prayed thus with himself God I thank thee that I'm not as other men are extortioners unjust adulterers or even as this Publican I fast twice in the week he does better than I do I give tithes of all that I possess and the publicans standing a far off would not lift up so much as his eyes Under heaven but smoted upon his breast and said God be merciful to me a sinner he said I tell you this man went down to his house Justified rather than the other don't you want to be justified don't you want to leave church and know that all your sins are under the blood then you got to come like the like the Publican came God be merciful to me a sinner yeah I tell you this man went down to his house Justified rather than the other for everyone that exalteth himself shall be the based and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted brandom said people who claim to be religious go to church Pious and still rank unbelievers Sinners Jesus said you're of your father the devil yet they were just as Pious and religious as they could be he said the worst demon demon there is to deal with is a religious demon you know there's seven times more demons in a religious unbeliever than a regular unbeliever that's right what the Bible says the unclean Spirit has gone out of a man what does that me make him religious right he walks through Dry places seeking rest and finding none then he says I will return to my house to my house from whence I came out because no one else has ever taken up residence oh you need the baptism of the Holy Ghost you need something to make you think different make you make you live the word make you walk with God I need it amen all of us needed he said he walketh through Dry Place seeking rest and findeth none he said I'll return to my house once they come out when come he findeth an empty sweat garnished very religious yeah and goeth he and taketh with himself seven other Spirits more wicked than himself he's actually more than seven times more wicked than the regular unbeliever yes they enter in and dwell there in the last state of that man is worse than the first even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation I'll say this sometimes you say well I I wasn't a Pharisee I come out of a life of sin sometimes a person that's even been saved off a bar stool can become a Pharisee it's it's amazing to me how quickly someone can become a judge of someone else after having lived a life and been forgiven by God and I'll say this let the word judge you not other people just come to the word yes Peter was that way Peter very quickly after having been saved from the worst thing you can do probably is to deny Jesus Christ and he's forgiven of that and then when he comes down to the Gentiles he won't eat with them he goes with the Pharisees quickly becomes a Pharisee but I thank God as we're getting down towards the close this morning right I thank God that Pharisees can get saved yeah you say why are you so thankful of that brother Ben because I was one yeah I've been a Pharisee I know what it's like to to look down on everybody else and know what and know that I'm better than what you are because I've never done it I've been there yeah but I was like that like that uh that tree coming out of the silo I didn't realize my life was dark and I needed Jesus as much as anybody else did listen to me you young people raised in church I want you to live without the scars I want you to raise up and never go out in the world I want you to live all your life for Jesus I want you to love him with all of your heart but listen to me you've got to receive him you've got to receive the Holy Ghost like everybody else does you got to recognize you're a sinner and you got to be delivered of a religious spirit and come into the house of God and believe God for your own salvation good Paul had to be delivered of being a Pharisee that gives me hope that there's room for people in hardy people who believe believe the message in whose parents and grandparents and great-grandparents all believe the message in people who are second third fourth fifth generation Believers but they still need a savior and there's room for you recovering Pharisee there's room for you if that's what you've been there's there's a place for you too see first he could have been saved no he wasn't but he could have been sir perhaps he could have been he could have been in that number but he refuse to do it there will be many you have to say whosoever will I say this if you want to you can be saved but Judas couldn't be saved so the Pharisee was the worst sinner 1 Timothy 1:12 I thank Christ Jesus our lord who has enabled me that he counted me faithful put putting me into the ministry who was before a blasphemer and a persecutor an injurious I hurt other people I didn't mean to but I hurt people yeah but I obtained Mercy because I did it ignorantly in unbelief he wasn't hurting people by the word sometimes we and there's nothing I hate more than having to hurt people I realize that sometimes what we preach hurts sometimes like what I say to people has it has to hurt it is going to hurt because it's the word and the word sometimes hurt but Lord let me be first partaker of it let me not give to others what I won't take myself but here he was injurious not realizing he was in blindness and a Pharisee but I obtained Mercy because I did it ignorantly in unbelief oh my and the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus he said this is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation that Christ Jesus came into the world to save Sinners of whom who's the worst sinner in Simon's house come on now of whom I am chief yes he already told us I was a Pharisee of the Pharisees I was the best Pharisee and the worst sinner yeah we could say that today I was the best message person but also the worst sinner how be it for this cause I obtained Mercy I love this that in me first Jesus Christ might show forth all longsuffering for a pattern that's a pattern I can look at but the herald didn't say I can be saved too you can be saved too a pattern to them should Hereafter believe on him to life Everlasting yes Jesus turned to the woman in verse 44 of Luke chapter 7 he told Simon he said you you never worshiped me when you invited me in oh we ought to worship him this morning said you never you never kissed me but she's washed my feet with tears and wiped them with the hairs of her head you didn't give me no kiss but this woman since the time I came in had not ceased to kiss my feet my head with oil thou did not anoint but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment wherefore I say unto thee you you say My Worship doesn't matter she begs to differ that's right come on this woman begs to differ you see it don't matter how I come to church it don't matter matter whether I raise my hands it don't matter whether I worship him when he comes it does matter yes sir she begs to differ but because she worshiped because she washed the feet of Jesus because she did something that was needed in the house of God and I'll say this worship is always needed in the house of God sometimes we need somebody to sweep the floors sometimes we need somebody to help with the kids sometimes we need somebody to put food on the table but always we need worship always we need the Praises of God to come from the people of God always we need the presence of God Amen said wherefore her sins which are many are forgiven for she loved much but to whom little Is Forgiven the same loveth little as the musicians come I want to ask you I've asked myself this question do I love him little or much there's a direct correlation between how I view myself whether I recognize that I am a sinner was a sinner saved by grace there a direct correlation between that and how I worship how I love him I want to love him with everything that I've got in me yes I don't want to love him a little he'll take that right brother BR said if you give him second place he'll take second place yes if you give him third place he'll take third place but of all people who ought to give him preeminence shouldn't have be us of all people who ought to give him first place who ought to entertain him when he comes in the house shouldn't it be us I'll say this with your head bowed and your eyes closed there is no worse sinner than Simon Pharisee but Paul knew that oh God he said I've done what I've done and I preached where I preach and I I I've taken persecution and all of these things because I knew that I was the chief of Sinners and God still loves Pharisees who are willing to repent I knew that I was the chief Sinner and so I loved him that much more I say God help me today you young people that have been raised in church can't you realize what he saved you from what he's kept you from you that have been decades in the house of God and you've never left you've always stood like a rock I thank you for that but don't you know that you ought to love him that much more because you could have been a Pharisee you could have been someone with no experience who just did what everybody else did but something got a hold of you if something could get a hold of me I believe that if Jesus could save me he could save the the worst prostitute the worst drunker the worst religious person in the world because he saved [Music] me I want to ask you with every head bowed and every eye closed I want to speak directly to I'll say to us Pharisees this morning maybe you became a Pharisee why don't you talk to him for a [Music] minute if if if that's you this morning and maybe you started looking down on other people and well I'm glad I'm not like that I'm glad I'm not like them glad I didn't do that that's okay but you better be careful if you've been a Pharisee a little bit of a Pharisee why don't you just raise your hand to him yeah brother man I've heard you preach like this before I have fact I may have preached this sermon here before I'll say this still the truth the Lord put this down in my heart so real today and in the p over the past few days L and I just had to follow what he said you've been a FY God bless that hand God bless that hand God bless that hand Lord I I want to be right I want to know that you've forgiven me of much I want to love you much Lord God bless those hands I'm going to pray for [Music] you Heavenly Father Lord we have many recovering Pharisees Among Us I'm one Lord but Lord I've been taught that your grace is so great that it even reached for me and all these Lord that had their hands
