Heavenly Father Lord as your Believers have gathered here on this Tuesday afternoon Lord we realize that it's out of form it's out of fashion lord it's out of our normal routine but Lord we're here because we're not just Sunday morning Christians Lord we're not just Easter and Christmas Christians but Lord we're your Believers we're your Messiah is and Lord your word is said that we must have that fresh kill of the word wherever two or three are gathered together you promise that you would come and be in their midst and Lord as we've gathered here tonight Lord different assemblies in the area represented here father Lord there's more than two or three here tonight but Lord there's a house full of Believers and Lord I know that whenever Believers get together father something good has to happen so Lord I invite you to come in this building Lord we fill your presence here Lord we feel the spirit of unity the spirit of power Lord we feel Lord that you're you're among us and the power of your Resurrection so Lord as we lay our hands upon one another we know that Mark 16 said they shall lay their hands upon the sick and they shall recover Lord I believe that goes beyond just preacher's father but Lord every holy ghost believer has a right to lay their hand upon another believer and Lord is the prayer of faith is going forth even now Lord I believe sicknesses can leave bodies Lord tormenting spirits that we're trying to hinder a Believer from enjoying the presence of God in the meeting tonight I know that you're able to to set the captive free so Lord we invite you

pray and all the Believers says amen and amen God bless you this evening in Ephesians the second chapter we want to look here in the fourth verse of Ephesians 2. Paul here says but God who is rich in Mercy how many beliefs he's rich in Mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us for when we even when we were dead in sin hath quickened us together with Christ by Grace you are saved and hath raised us up together notice this hath raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus so notice this he hath raised us up so he's not left us where we were but he's raised us up and where he's raised us to his Heavenly places that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding Riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus now I also want to look in the book of Colossians the third chapter the book of Colossians the third chapter and in the first verse I want to pull a passage of scripture from there this evening in Colossians 3 and verse 1. I know you all know this verse by heart Paul here again writing he says if ye then be risen with Christ seek those things which are above so you've been raised up now seek those things which are up where you've been raised to seek those things which are above where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God notice this word set somebody say set set your affection on things above and not on things on the earth for ye are dead and your life is hid with Christ in God and when Christ who is our life shall appear then shall ye also appear with him in glory amen we ask Lord this evening to add the blessing to reading of his word as you can be seated here this evening amen God bless you brother Vernon sure good to see you this evening buddy amen the the book of Ephesians in the book of Colossians I believe are two very very powerful books in the Bible and from those uh passages of scripture tonight I want to speak to you for just a few moments here and if I title this tonight I want to speak to you on Heavenly set Heavenly set I I believe that this is not the hour to be drifting I believe this is the hour to be set I don't believe this is the hour to be wondering or looking here or there trying to find something to believe trying to find something to get a part of but this is the hour to be said I believe this is the hour Amen to set our Spirits Amen to send our hearts to set our mind to set our Focus amen not on everything but on one thing and that is the Lord Jesus Christ now the pride of God said and presuming he said I put my choice with the Full Gospel many years ago he said and I'm happier every day about it I'm thankful to be one of them how many can say I'm thankful to be one of them and having this Grand experience of receiving Christ Just My Savior and in returns having him to fill me with his Holy Spirit and living in my heart daily as a witness to me that I have passed from Death unto life and testing my plan of my salvation each day as I take inventory see just the way the spirit in me what does it feel like how does it cooperate amen with the things of the world or is it so Heavenly Sent till the world seems dull dingy and dirty amen is the Heavenly spirit in you is your spirit so Heavenly said amen to the things of the world become dull they become dingy and they become dirty again Junction of time 56 he said Noah was right taking away Not only was he performing a miracle or looking for a miracle he said but the church today as it is laboring away under the task of the preaching of the Gospel with signs and wonders of following they are preparing for a miracle that's why we're here tonight as we are preparing for a miracle see and that Miracle is the rapture of the church he said and the going home amen the miracle that we're looking for amen is beyond just cancer being healed it's beyond just blind eyes being open it's beyond and then just the deaf hearing or the dumb speaking but the miracle that we are looking for amen is the miracle of the changing of our bodies listen amen we've got a right tonight amen to petition Our Father amen for the Fulfillment of his promise listen I didn't make the promise I will not fulfill the promise Amen brother Branham did not make the promise he will not fulfill the promise amen but God who is rich in Mercy made a promise that some morning had been between six and nine your body is going to come under the influence of a change amen from habited to immortality that's not going to be an emotion it's not going to be a feeling amen but it's going to be the greatest miracle that you've ever experienced amen is it the moment in the twinkling of the night amen you go from one dimension to another amen we are preparing people getting them live getting them unburdened amen from the things of the world and getting their soul set in the presence of God Amen that when Jesus does appear the second time in glory amen those who are ready for the Rapture will be caught up together Amen to meet him in the air and be with him amen we are our Spirits are becoming unfocused on the things of the world and they are becoming so Heavenly Sent amen took the things of this world are becoming dull they're becoming dingy and they're becoming dirty amen but there's a bride whose Soul has been said in the presence of God again he said don't be tossed about with every wind of Doctrine believe God's word amen get stable and get set amen believe God's word get table and get sent listen amen the days of playing church is over and then the days are being on fire one week and being cold the next them days are over hey then the days of entertaining the things of the world one day that entertaining the things of God the next them days are over amen but the Church of the Living God under the teaching of the message of the hour has come to a stability amen where we're not focused on the things of the world Amen but our Focus has been heavily since now I love that word Heavenly it means relating to Heaven or the heavens amen it is divine it is suggesting the Blessed state of Heaven now I've just got to give you a disclaimer of what I believe amen I don't believe we got to wait till we get to heaven to enjoy Heaven amen but I believe there's a bride on this side of Eternity amen that's already enjoying the Heavenly things amen because she has received the Heavenly experience Amen in her soul that has moved to her amen from the influence of corruption to the influence of immortality amen from the info words of sin Amen to the influence of Faith amen it's time to be looking towards heaven now when you look at this word saying I know it's a small word we use it every day but it packs a powerful definition it means to put lay or stand something in a specified place or position it means to be situated or fixed in a specified place or position it means to put a seed or a plant in the ground to grow it means to put a meant a sail up in position to catch the wind it needs to call someone or something Amen to start doing something so when you said something amen you're putting it in position Amen to start doing something it means to instruct someone Amen to do something it means to give someone a task a minute means to have a blossom or a tree it means to develop into or produce fruit amen so you don't just throw a plan out there amen but you set the plants amen you don't just throw an apple seed out there amen but you set the apple seed in hopes and then when the sun and the water and the and the elements that it takes to cause the seed to grow amen comes upon the seed you're going to see an influence amen of a fruit come out of that seed and I believe that it's the Bride of Jesus Christ the prophet of God said amen that we are heavenlies in our soul he didn't say we're heavenlies in our flesh he didn't say we're heavenlies in our spirit amen but we are heavenlies in our soul and mother man emphatically teaches that the believer's position in Christ amen is in Heavenly places amen then the position that the believer has been set in amen is not in depression amen your position is not in anxiety and then your position is not in the Republican party or the Democrat Party or the Liberal Party amen but your heavenly given position amen is in Heavenly places amen and that is the only place that a Believer amen can grow and listen this bride will not grow in a cold and different atmosphere amen because she's not a layout of sin statement she will not grow in a society and then because she's not a citizen of this Kingdom amen but she's been claimed by eighteen seen amen from before the foundation of the world her life has been placed in Prophecy therefore the only place she can grow up is where the message of the hour has Supreme preeminence good this ride can grow is the place where the message has amen the supreme position the Supreme preeminence listen amen this is not a Pentecostal message this is an adoption message it is a message that is positionally placing us Amen in Heavenly places let me let me say this the bride by an adoption message has been positionally placed in the heavenlies now I can prove it to you about the message the prophet said the heavenlies amen is the position of the church he said the position of the church amen should be plum in the heavenlies amen not down here floating around through the clouds buzzing around like an airplane amen but something that's propelled by something amen that sends it beyond anything that an airplane can think of Amen it's an astronaut amen that's the age we're living in now amen is spiritual astronauts amen so through the countdown message we have come from the horse and buggy we have come from the automobile we have come from the airplane amen and we had broke out into the influence of outer space amen and the prophet of God said the age we're now living in amen is spiritual astronauts he said again live in the heavenlies and I propose to you tonight amen that we don't just visit the heavenlies they've been in a special meeting we don't just visit the heavenlies amen come on young people we don't just visit the heavenlies at Youth Camp amen but under the message of the hour amen we have been positionally placed in the heavenlies amen that no matter what's going on around us no matter what's going on about us amen we are in the heavenlies and the devil can't defeat us amen discouraged we can't hold us come on there's a seed inside of you amen and that seed has been quickened amen by Heavenly influenced amen that's why the devil hates you amen because everything he throws at you amen you rise above it amen every sickness should rise above it you say well somebody got sick and they died amen but some morning between six and nine amen that dead in Christ shall rise upon these human bodies listen we're not living by the Earthly things amen we're living by the Heavenly amen we're not moving by the Earthly news we're living by the Heavenly news and it's the Gospel of Jesus Christ we are living in the heavenlies he said carry yourself away amen how many say oh God carry me away tonight amen I think that's what we need to do is we need to get carried away in the spirit again you know why we're seeing so many problems amen and that's all we see it's cause it's been a month of Sundays since we got carried away in the spirit you know why every little thing's bothering us and afflicting us it's because we've lost the ability Amen to forget what's going on around us amen and look to Jesus amen but I challenge you tonight amen forget what so-and-so's to him forget what so and so saying and remember you're under the influence of a Heavenly message Amen to raise you above all this Earthbound chatter chatter into a place with God where you can see things beyond the way the Earth sees him amen carry you away till you see things that is to come was which is and shall come amen lifting up above anything in the church that has had since the days that Christ amen was on Earth and we're enjoying it today sure we're in a great age friends amen it's a great time it's an astronaut age amen this bride is not in a Pentecostal amen airplane age amen she has been raised by the message the hour amen the fourth line the fourth last the the fourth life right he said the first and the second and the third but the fourth light was the restoration amen that put this bride out of the Earthly Dimension now I just got to preach to you amen cause every every advancement up to the astronaut was still EarthBound come on the horse and buggy was on the earth amen the automobile was on the earth you say well brother Andrew the airplane got up it got up amen but it was still underneath amen the influence of the earth amen but the first thing amen that left the Earthly Dimension amen was an astronaut and for 2 000 years we've been teaching Earthly doctrines and Earthly ideas but in the evening time it shall be light and when that light comes it'll be a day star that'll rise in your heart and it'll lift you up off of this Earth listen I don't know about you amen but I can see things amen beyond the way the Baptist sees them I can see things beyond the way the Pentecostal season it's because I've been ordained amen by the message of the hour Amen to see the things it was to see the things that are and to see the things which has to come listen you're not a bunch of horse and buggy drivers you're not a bunch of airplane pilots you're not a bunch of automobile drivers your spiritual astronauts in the astronaut age and you have been positionally placed in the heavenlies by the Holy Ghost itself among church it's a quote even justification made way for sanctification and sanctification made way amen for the baptism of the Holy Ghost but the baptism of the Holy Ghost made way for the person the Holy Ghost itself amen the word to come back to Perfection listen friends you have not been placed by a man you placed by the Holy Ghost itself we've got more than just the gifts but we have received the giver we have received the headstone we received the triumphal entry of the Capstone in this generation we are not a bunch of automobile drivers we're spiritual astronauts and if we're spiritual astronauts then we got to have astronaut faith come on Church it for Spiritual astronauts we gotta have astronaut Faith he said the first thing is these things we're talking about amen they are so are they not he said we know the Bible promised it but is he hears let me ask the question but is he here he said God is here to do what he promised he would do amen God is here see we've gone beyond speaking with tongues he never said we dismissed it he said we've gone beyond it see that's all right see we've Gonna Be on these little things and see we're in a place now where we've got to have astronaut Faith that's astronaut power they meant to realize we're in Christ already and then we've got to have astronaut Faith which is astronaut power Amen to realize we're in Christ already had just more of Christ see Amen to lift us up into Heavenly places then there is a faith of this hour and the faith of this hour is astronaut Faith see remember said the faith of this hour is going to take more faith than ever with in any age amen for this has to be amen rapturing Faith to be taken up amen then the source of rapturing faith is coming from the astronaut anointing then the astronaut phase is the rapturing faith which is the rapturing power oh praise God he said it'll take astronaut Faith Amen to plow for this Earth some to meet Jesus that's right he said you don't want to be left to sleep and merge him then you better get in the astronaut age right now and get up above these things amen that's your own and above it it's hard for people to understand they've never seen it it's something new but just the same it's proven that it's God he said see here's one of his final and latest achievements is to manifest himself and say he that believeth in me amen The Works that I do shall he do also amen that their scriptures pertaining to the astronauts are you in the church there's actually scriptures that are pertaining to you as astronauts he said count down again we're lifted far beyond that now he said the churches away Beyond this young man he said the spiritual church it's the eagle age now see the astronaut flying on above looking down at the fellow citizen chickens he we're far above that we're way up yonder in the heavenlies amen we're far above the horse and buggy we're far above the automobile we're far above the airplane we are way up above it in the heavenlies where Christ amen becomes the full thing that takes completely over and lives his life and acts through you amen exactly like he did here on Earth he said astronaut age that count down his own Brother come on what did he say the countdown he said and only goes ten nine seven or ten nine eight seven six five four three two one zero blast off he said but this countdown has gone one two three four five six seven he said Church is Zero Hour hey then there's not another age coming there's not another hour coming there's not another Prophet coming there's not another message on its way amen this is the final boss to the final age this is the final message Amen to lift the bride off of the earth into the heavenlies with Christ listen I'll tell you what I'm going to do amen I'm going to beat that devil come out of here tonight we have become two EarthBound when I'm just here some might as well preach amen we're too Earthbound you say me yeah I'm saying me you every one of us we have come to Earthbound we're too worried about this and worried about man and what's the future hold and the American dollars losing value and the political worlds in an uproar and they can't produce a republican they can't produce a Democrat amen our eyes have become so Earthbound that the things of the world have become our Focus amen but God who is rich in Mercy has fulfilled his promised word and his sin and anointing in this age to lift your eyes off of these things Amen to see like Enoch they meant to see like Abraham come on church I want to see like David amen I want to be able to stand and say I once was young amen but now I'm old and I've never seen the righteous forsaken or his seed begging bread I want to see like Abraham I want to see that my father owns the Catalan of thousand healed I want to walk like Enoch I Want to Love Like Jesus I want to pray like Daniel and the only thing that can put me in position to do it is the word of the age I'm living now you say brother Andrew to Earth bound Prophet God said show us the father 55 he said they need their eyes open I said yes brother Adam that's right I do too they need their eyes open he said people become so Earthbound just like this was the only place there was but there's a Heavenly world too it's this it's all around us so notice brother Jeff he wasn't saying there's a Heavenly world coming he said there's a heaven Heaven world too and it's all around us listen you don't have to die to go see heaven Heaven has come into this Dimension Heaven is wherever Christ is yes things are to be there's a real heaven I believe that but what about the Father's prayer when he said Lord let thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven that that was a prophecy that before the kingdom of God would come the Heavenly Kingdom there would be a spiritual Kingdom who would be operating according Amen to the code that they are operating in the Heavenly Kingdom there is a Heavenly world too and it's all around us now what catches my attention there brother brother Ben is it said they need their eyes open and this is the age the age where the astronauts would be born out of that the Bible said that he would anoint your eyes with eyes have that thou mayest be able to see look at this word see it means to look it means to discern it means to see with ones with the Mind's Eye it means to understand it means to discover it means to observe it means to contemplate it means to weigh carefully to examine now look at this other definition it means turning towards something it means to face it so when you actually see something you actually put your body in position you've turned towards it and you can see it listen amen somebody tell you to see something sometimes to really see it you got to change your position if you're going to see it amen if I say if I say look brother Harvey's in the back and you keep sitting there looking at me you're never going to see by the harmony amen because the only way you're going to see him is you've got to turn your body in the direction that the voice is announcing there's a sight to see a Church of the Living God Amen there's more on this world to see amen than just our jobs and our schools and our careers amen but there's a Heavenly world and then there's a Heavenly Dimension there's a Heavenly man I'm on church I see the resurrection I see the Rapture I see the future hold I see things that are to me I see a theophany I see a Brides Revival I hear the sounding of seven punders I see the revelation of the book of Revelation and the age I'm living and the only way I could see it was to be changed from the way I was sinning in the Earthly Dimension and raised the Heavenly places [Applause] if you're gonna see some things you're going to turn around and look at them hey y'all know I'm telling you the truth if you're gonna see it you're gonna turn sometimes people say well I don't know brother said may they understand he said anoint their eyes with ASAP he sent an anoint mind too that's a mouthful and it's a prophet of God didn't just want to tell you it was there he wanted to see it too brother Joe he wanted to see what he was telling you to look at he said anoint Man Too Lord that we might see the invisible God now that's a that's an all-night preaching point right there that we might see the invisible God who is working among his people as he promised look here that's almost a contradicting statement amen see the invisible God if something is invisible how are you going to see it unless it comes into the realm of his ability and the prophet of God said the word was invisible until it was made flesh and then the word become visible amen so now the Church of the Living God can receive the ice have Amen to see the invisible God in her age he said through his sacrificial death at Calvary and his resurrection amen positionally placed his church in that realm he said that the same invisible God could come into the individual and make the word visible oh my if you can see friends the invisible God is made visible so the connection or the job between invisible God and visible God is a word made flesh and when the word is made flesh amen the word is made flesh by the manifestation of the word and the prophet of God said the bride's Mage amen is the revealed word right the mate of the Bride is a revealed word he said that how shall he appear in the last days is to bring the bride back to the revealed word which is her mate he said and the word made flesh is the light of the age when you see it come on church amen that's why we can't hold our peace that's why we're preaching on a Tuesday night amen that's why we're gathered out here on a Tuesday night meeting they've been singing and that's the glory of God it's because we've seen him in the invisible God in hell he is no longer behind the fail a tradition he is no longer behind the veil amen if some men made denomination but the invisible God has been made visible in my age by the preaching of the message of the hour I can see Jesus I can hug his neck amen I can kiss his feet I can love on him tonight because the message has brought him visible yeah oh they say preacher won't you calm down you tell me how I can see what I see and be quiet about it [Music] I can believe what I believe how this you tell me how I can live every day under the influence of some moment I could see my loved ones appear behind me and hold my peace about it listen I'm not Earthbound I'm not a chicken ass I'm in denominational chicken I have been released by The quickening Power of the mercy of God and the age I'm living in I can see things beyond the way the world sees him I can believe things beyond the way the denomination believes them because the Holy Spirit has anointed my eyes with the I said now people say well preacher you better be careful about this about this fourth line and this bright age well let's just say what a prophet says that okay he said without the baptism of the Holy Ghost you can never have your eyes open to a true spiritual revelation of the word now you tell me what was the baptism of the Holy Ghost it was the Pentecostal age what was the bride age it was the word itself the Holy Ghost itself so you can't go justification sanctification skip the baptism and go to the Holy Ghost itself but the justification pave the way for the sanctification and the sanctification paid way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the baptism of the Holy Ghost paved the way for the Holy Ghost itself and that my friend is the spiritual revelation of the word and the age that you're living listen this eye thing it's more than just anointing your eyes to see remember the door of the soul is the eye the problem of God said the door of the Soul it is the eye now what age are we living in we're living in the laodicean age I get that I'm not ignorant I can read come on go look at your stature a perfect man pyramid and between the seventh age and the Capstone was a wreath feeling of the Holy Ghost which was the age when the son of man would be revealed between the Son of God and the son of David come on church he comes in three sins names Revelation series remember said he comes in four Sons he said Son of Man Son of God Son of David Son of Abraham he said Son of Abraham he's heir to the Royal Grant he's son of man he's heir to the Earth he said that Son of God he's heir to all things he said Son of David he's heir to the throne amen then watch a prophet showing you positionally where you are you're not under the Son of God you're not under the son of David you're not under the son of Abraham according to Luke 17 30 you are under the son of man which is the where he is the heir to the Earth come on church and it's in the rise of the sun he said for the first time he said the sheath must be waived amen over the Church of the Living God Amen to show amen that there's more to come after the one that has come to maturity then tell me where did you come from you didn't come from Pluto you didn't come from Neptune amen you come from the earth amen then when the son of man returned according to Luke 17 30 he was returning to take possession of what he was going to reign with in the Millennium come on Church you are the citizens of the future home you are the occupants of the Millennium you are the people who will sit at the marriage supper I'm the lamb and the son of man has been revealed in this generation to claim you from religion to claim you from certainty and to put you in a position with God where you can believe I never become a son I always was a son I never become a daughter of God I always was one I say oh God anoint our eyes to see anoint our eyes to see that we're not about your Pentecostals up and down in and out we have come to a mature revelation We Are Who the word says we are come on Church you know I'm preaching you the truth it's all through the message it's the son of man claiming his rights now the product God said there's two types of blindness he said there's physical blindness and there's spiritual blindness now watch this he said certain man told me that they said if you be a servant of Christ you have the Holy Ghost then strike me blind I said Paul he says Paul struck a man blind he said you strike me blind I said brother I can't do what the devil's already done do what the devil's already done you're blind now and don't know it brother Vernon that man could drive a car that man could pay his own bills that man could walk to the grocery Market unassisted but he was so blind he couldn't even see amen that God was standing before him veiled in a flesh body called a Vindicated prophet he said you're blind now and don't know it he said when the Bible speaks blind it means physical blind I said well then tell me how Elisha amen struck the whole Syrian Army blind and said are you looking for Elisha he struck the whole Syrian Army blind and brother Joe he turns and says are you looking for Elisha they said yes said well follow me I'm on church amen they could see but they couldn't see Elisha unless they followed a Vindicated prophet he said if you're looking for Elisha then follow me and I'll show you where he's at let me just go and say if you get before this message you're not going to find the future home you're not going to find a body change come on Church you're not going to find the marriage supper of the lamb but the leadership of this age is to follow the Vindicated word of the age that you're living in he said I'll show you where he's had he said gehaisa was blind and he was standing there and he come in and he said hey he said Elisha he said we're in a bad shape he said they're surrounding us out there he said Elisha went out there come back in and said there's more with us than there is with him nobody brother Jeff LED gehaza out there and let him back his physical eyesight conceived but his spiritual eyesight was blind but when Elisha walked out there and looked at the mountains looked at the hills he said there's more with us than there is with him he said the mountains was on fire the angels of fire he said around that Prophet amen it was there until God opened his eyes he said Elijah there's more with us than there is with him he said well I couldn't see nobody said God opened this boy's eyes and when his eyes come open amen the mountain was on fire the angels are power the Chariots of power sure amen he's here I'm gonna I find it amazing brother Joel that this same word to use is in in the message from that time Amen to declare his presence is the same words that he said Elisha used Amen to declare his presence think of Hazel and he said amen there's more with us than there is with him in other words God by prophets Vindicated words amen Open the Eyes of that boy he meant to see there is more with us than there is with him listen friends Dr Dobson will never open your eyes John Hagee will never open your eyes Billy Graham will never open your eyes amen their good man had good jobs amen but there's a bride but her eyes could only be opened amen by the revelation of the son of man and the age that she's living He said when Christian Believers can believe when Christian Believers can believe that present now right now sitting together seated here in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen fellowshipping around the word of God the Holy Spirit here taking the word of God by Vision moving it out to every heart like that as the word is going forth every believer receiving it if we could stand then and claim our god-given privileges among church amen when the word is coming forth and the anointing is moving that's not the time to sit there and start calculating how many times you've heard a preacher preach that quote how many times you've heard him cover that scripture amen that's the time Amen to defy that Earthbound influence and rise up and claim amen your god-given privileges as a manifested child of the almighty God come on Church somebody Gonna Leave Here Tonight with healing somebody Gonna Leave Here Tonight with a blessing somebody's going to leave here tonight amen with an answer from God you say preacher you get Pentecostal no amen I'm just preaching the word of faith and the word of faith says wherever two or three are gathered together in my name there I am in their midst listen you ain't got to let a blessing pass you amen want more service I believe right here right now if your eyes can come open amen by the revelation of the word you can say healing is mine Joy is mine victory is mine peace is mine the prodigal son is mine The Prodigal daughter is mine I'm on church that's the faith anointing you it meant to rise up out of this condition of laodicea of blindness and claim what God has opened your eyes to see what I'm talking that is your spiritual blindness yeah and the prophet of God said it's 10 million times worse than physical blindness he said if I had to go blind let it be my physical eyes and God let me keep the eyes of my spirit he said I want to see his glory he said I want to see he's here here he said I want to say that Christ still lives I'm on Church what did they say to Fanny Crosby they said sell out your gift amen send out your gift she said I would rather sing this music she said with these blinded eyes and for the first time my eyes come open to look upon my savior I'm on church amen and that was under an anointing that's not even your anointing but she was so dedicated that she wanted to see Jesus what about a church of living God I think it's time to get our eyes off of all the problems all the disappears imma get your eyes off all the confusion and get your eyes back on the glory of the Lord you're going to see him if you can just get the Holy Ghost anoint your eyes now I know why the eyes get tightened up it's because there's a cold drift coming through the church early said Mama took that grease he said that matter in her eyes so thick he said we couldn't see nothing he said Mama come in there with that hot grease rub it in her eyes he said now that's not cool grease today will work he said but he said it worked in the natural but not today he said there's some cold grass and if the churches got into he said you're going to have to let the Holy Spirit I sound anoint the eyes of his church and get all the cold out of your eyes he said another place I'm afraid her eyes have sort of frozen shut and she is blind to what God has for her I'm on church amen he didn't say you're blind to what he's got for some other age amen but you're blind to what God's got for you but she needs some huddle or the spirit of God Amen to open her eyes unless she receives the spirit of God she will go on substituting program for power and Creed for word she counts numbers for Success amen rather than to look for fruit now watch what prophet of God says he says Lord that they might be awakened out of this slump that the churches get into their spiritual mind he said they've seen so many things that it's become numb like the little boy I spoke of he said but God let the numbness leave tonight I'm not a crazy man but I just felt the Holy Ghost run right through me that's the numbness leave tonight anoint our eyes what I said listen and anoint our hearts to Believe come on church this Holy Ghost is not just throwing your eyes to see but he's got to anoint your hearts Amen to believe what your eyes are seeing listen you can have your eyes anointed and you can see and see and see but if your heart is not anointed you will never believe what your eyes are seeing but if the anointing leaves your eyes then strikes your heart you will go from seeing the message to believe in the message you will go from reading the quotes to manifesting the clothes because they are sad as anointed your eyes it's anointed come on I say old Khan brother burden I say let the Holy Ghost amen anoint for church again anoint our eyes to see and on our mouth to confess and on our heart to believe and on our hands to raise anoint our feet to stomp on the head of that defeated devil oh God anoint us again with the Dynamics of the fire of God in the church [Applause] we need that eye sand we need it more than we need new sound systems we need it more than we need new buildings we need it more listen I'd rather be under a tree with a shiny somewhere and have this Holy Ghost hot oil to burn this layout of seeing us out of my eyes oh I want to see him brother I just don't want to see him I seem yeah brother Ben I don't just want to see him I see him and when I see him my heart believes what I'm seeing [Applause] anoint our eyes to see anoint our heart to believe come on Church anoint

brother Joe I am obligated to hear one man and his name is William Marion Branham [Music] church if you don't want me to preach don't push back I'm obligated to hear one man and his name is William Brown I am subject to a pastor but what I believe is not subject to be approved by any preacher in this message what I believe is approved by the Holy Ghost I'm following the same pillar of power that led Moses that led Paul that led William Branham has returned to the church in the last days and it's a lot upon our path it's a walk of righteousness it's a walk of faith and those who will come under this anointing of the heavenlies will walk like Enoch walked yeah well we might as well preach we're here you don't judge what your pastor's teaching by what a man down the road is teaching you judge it by what a prophet taught [Applause] ain't the first time it's got me in trouble it won't be the last I love my Minister and brothers but I do not judge what I believe by what they teach I judge what I believe by what a prophet taught come on and every man of God preaching this message is doing the same thing this ain't a boys club this is a five-fold Ministry oh we ain't learning how to tie knots and ropes and survive in the dark we're preaching a body change and we gotta get under something that'll lead us from one dimension to another and the only thing that'll do it is the

say now what is this word explore mean it's a it's a very powerful word explore means to travel in or through an unfamiliar country or area in order to learn about it or familiarize oneself with it it means to search for resources [Music] it means to inquire into or discuss a subject or issue in detail it means to examine or evaluate an option or a possibility and preaching out on every one of those definitions it means to travel through an unfamiliar country or area in order to learn about it and to familiarize oneself with it it means to search for resources it means to inquire into or discuss the subject or issue in detail it means to examine or evaluate it means an option or possibility I love what the prophet of God said he said get acquainted with the Heavenly things of that spirit that comes down from heaven where Holiness stands we're angels of God stand where Jesus Christ stands at the right hand of God in majesty and glory and Holiness and power then you walk as a stranger here because you're an alien here you're not of this world come on church I don't want to be recognized by this layout of sea and send love and God forsaken hell-bound generation I want to be

and I checked the news while I was reading amen you got to shut off everything and examine it amen find the nuggets I remember in 2005 when my great-grandfather first time is the United Methodist preacher served the United Memphis Church Faithfully for years first service he ever goes to in the message 2005. brother Eddie best school was that brother Donny's church and my grandmother had invited him to come he comes with us we go to church and out of all the servants Brothers hope that brother mystical could have preached on he preaches a sermon called a holy resourceful Rich Nation and in that sermon he says now there is a mother and it's the Roman Catholic church and he said now she's got daughters and he said those are prostitute daughters he said they're hirlets he set their denominations he said their Baptist Methodist Presbyterian he goes thumb and out of all the heart that he could have focused on he focused on the one called the Methodist Church and said look how far they've come from John Wesley look how far they've come and he said like this he said now the pope just recently died and he said when he died he said your president went and knelt down by the Polk's body line and state he said when he knelt down by his body he said a prophet said the time would come that there would be an act committed that would lead the world back under amen a Roman Catholicism in person I don't have time to preach it but I'll say this look at your government look at your Supreme Court look at your white house it's Catholic from through and through come on Amen and brother bisco said as far as I'm concerned amen this was the act that let him in he said but unto you whose names are on the Lamb's Book of Life you will never bow and need to this system you will never be abounded you will never stay in this if there's a word to call you out we got in the car after church wondering what in the world is granddaddy gonna say he got in the car we rode up the road for a few minutes real quiet somber looks over at my grandmother he says if any message that anybody in the world needs to hear the whole world needs to hear that he said I want you the next day he said I want you the next day to write the denomination that we're in and take our names off the roll and my granddaddy for his last few short years amen died a believer of this message [Applause] [Music] you know why because there's resources in it are in it there's an exit in it there is a way to come out of what you're in but you're not going to find it amen by just canceling looking at it so the other

said he would fly said sister Vicki he gets so high hit his head come right back down remember said I watched him he turn and just walk right back over there and sit down he said I looked that and I thought you know what some wise achievement a man had put him in a cage what put him in that cage brother Harold was a wise achievement of some man put him in a cage that's the same word brother Branham uses to put you in an astronaut age as an achievement yeah yeah the same word to bind an eagle in a cage is the same word god used to profit to speak over you to release you from a cage and put you in the heavilies Robertson I'll watch that for a few minutes and he said I saw a zookeeper walk by he said brother Jeff I stopped the guy and I said sir I'll give you a hundred dollars to

Theology and they say the days of Miracles has passed they say that to keep you away from the real thing of God he said walking around out here trying to satisfy that blessed hunger that God put in
