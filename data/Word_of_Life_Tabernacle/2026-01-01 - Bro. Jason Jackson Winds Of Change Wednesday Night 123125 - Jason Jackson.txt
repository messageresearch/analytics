Thank the Lord &gt;&gt; to all the promises that we can benefit from the word of God. &gt;&gt; Pray for us this evening as we try to sing this is what heaven means to me. A country where no twilight shadows deepening were not will never be. Think about it tonight. Oh, it's a city where no storm clouds forget. Oh, this is just what heaven means to me. God will lead me when we get over young and we join the throne around the blessing sea. Oh, we'll join our love ones and crown price forever. Oh, this is just whatever means to me. A place where there is no misunderstood. from all evil and strive to breathe. No one can work to the heart or soul. Oh, it is just whatever means to me.

Good to have you, sis. Sister Ashley comes and sings right after this. I try to pray, but the words aren't coming out the way they used to. &gt;&gt; Did I lose my faith? God, do I still trust you? I try to worship. But when I lift my hand, it all just feels so empty. Is it the heavy of the world or is it just me for a thousand times? You're perfect and you'll never leave my side. Can I be hest? I just want to know that you still got this when all I'm holding on to is a promise. And God, you promised that you'll never leave me. When I'm scared of the dark, you're right there with me. Your kindness never fails. It's always reaching after me. But right now, God, all I need is to be honest. Oh, I've heard stories of you showing up when it was least expected. Every time you prove your time was always perfect in the way it was worth it. And again and again and again. See your power coming through. You see life to death. There's nothing you can do. I believe you did it. So won't you do it now? Can I be honest? I just want to know that you still got this. All I'm holding on to is the promise. And God, you promise that you'll never leave me. But I'm scared of the dark. You're right there with me. Your kindness never fails. It's always reaching after me. But right now, girl, all I need is your breath and I can't breathe. Your eyes mean I can't see. an anchor that the waves crash on. Be my heart when I can feel and show me something real. Just one taste of heaven in here now. Can I be hest? Oh, can I be hest? I just want to know that you still got this. When all I'm holding on to is a promise. And God, you promise that you never leave me. When I'm scared of the dark, you're right with me. Your kindness never fails. is always reaching after me. But I now got all I need. Yeah, I now got all I need is to be honest. the weapon may be formed, but it won't prosper. When the darkness falls, it won't prevail. For the God I serve knows only how to triumph. My God will never fail. My God will never fail. I'm going to see a victory. I'm going to see a victory. For the battle belongs to you, Lord. I'm going to see the victory. I'm going to see the victory. For the battle belongs to you, Lord. There's power in the mighty name of Jesus. Every war he wages, he will win.

We had a request for Sister Anna to sing this song. Have you enjoyed the specials tonight? I believe this is the last one. And then you want to sing, too? No. Okay. All right. Well, I just open it up. Hey, you know, we won't be here all night. I told Jason though, he text me earlier and he said, "I've got 27 pages." I said, "Well, uh, you're going to have to cut some of them off cuz I got a lot of songs." And uh hopefully hopefully he will go ahead and sing sis. Do you enjoy all of them tonight? I mean give all of our singers a wonderful hand if you would. Strong winds are blowing withered unreenting folks. People running to and fro. They don't know what's going on. Lands are failing because of turmoil in the land. Tes are closing. Free just can't take a stand. But it's going to take us all the way on the lips to keep me from my promises. Going to take all the way in the lips to turn me around. Going to take a lips because my feet are on solid ground. People are living no different than the world claiming to know the Lord but truly serving other gods. They go on day and night but they don't produce the light. anointed words at the end time. They're rejecting the Holy Cross. It's going to take a stronger than this to keep me from my promises. Going to take a stronger than this to turn me around. Going to take it stronger in the grips because my feet are on solid ground. Even searching for the true and living God. There's a famine in the land and the word seems nothing more. They have eyes we cannot see. They have ears we cannot hear. If they only knew scripture, they know that Jesus Christ is here. And it's going to take a stronger win than this to keep me from my promises. Going to take a stronger win than this to turn me around. Going to take a stronger than this because my feet are on solid ground. Oh, it's going to take it stronger in the keep me from my promises. Going to take it stronger in the lips to turn me around. Going to take it stronger in the lips to keep this eagle down. Let's stand together. Amen. Would you give the Lord another hand clap of praise tonight? Anybody lost glasses here at the local church? We found glasses over the weekend. So, just uh I'll have them if you lost them. Amen. Did you come to see Jesus tonight? Amen. And there's nothing we can do to help you. We can try to set an atmosphere and try to invite him here, but if he don't show up, it's all in vain. But I believe he's here tonight. Amen. I believe he loves to be worshiped. So, let's just worship him. Amen. I'm going to have our pastor come and and introduce brother Jason tonight. Amen. How many's looking forward to the word of the Lord this evening? Amen. Let's just sing this as we turn it to our pastor. I really want to see. Oh yes, it's Jesus I really want to see. Oh, this is Jesus I really want to sing. Oh yes, the more I see of this old world, the less it means to me. for it's Jesus I really want. If you want to see him, would you just slip a hand up to him here tonight? Oh yes, it's Jesus I sing it with all of your heart now. Oh, it's Jesus. Oh, I really want to see. Oh, thank you, Lord. Oh, the more I see of this sorrowless it means to me. Oh, it's Jesus. Oh, I really want to see Jes. Oh, don't you love him tonight? Aren't you glad you can see him? It has been revealed to us in this hour by the word of the Lord. Amen. I I just want to say how special this night is for me as a pastor. I when I kind of on a whim invited brother Jason to come and then he said he would let out his service tonight. I it just was so uh such an honor for me to to be able to fellowship with brother Jason. Over the years I some of y'all that are here um you don't think of yourselves as old-timers but I do. When I came among you 25 years ago, I guess I I uh y'all welcomed me with open arms and was watching Brother Danny sing tonight. His precious daddy's gone on to be with the Lord, but brother Herb taught me to fish and here in this area and fish for trout and and uh people like that that we believe we're going to see him one of these days. &gt;&gt; If we see Jesus now, we're going to see our loved ones then. And you know, brother Brandham told us, he said he thought so much of us. He said he knew that we'd be wondering if our loved ones made it. So before we see him, we're going to get to see one another. We're going to get to see the people we've we've loved and that we knew. And I believe that day is coming. &gt;&gt; I believe it's real soon. &gt;&gt; This year, a lot has happened. Brother Brandham talked about a pope coming from America, from the United States that happened, I believe, this year was fulfilled. There's a second part to that quote. He talks about how the bride would come together and love one another. And I believe tonight we can fulfill our part of that. Maybe 2026 doesn't ever have to get here before the service is over. Maybe we can just all go home. Wouldn't that be wonderful? Wouldn't it be wonderful? I don't believe that's just a story. One of these days it's going to happen. &gt;&gt; And when it does, I'm ready for it. What about you? &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you love him tonight? Do you love the Lord? Do you love one another tonight? Thank you so much for coming. We sure appreciate you being here tonight. Let's give our attention to the word as brother Jason Jackson comes. And the Jason and I have been friends, I guess, for 25, 30 years, something like that. And uh he was at my wedding and we've always been close. and I sure appreciate his friendship and it's an honor to have him speak here at the church for us. Just pray the Lord will use him tonight and and uh that he'll speak directly to us. Let's sing this once again. It's Jesus I really came to see as brother Jason comes tonight. Amen. Let's sing it now with all of our heart. Oh yes, it's Jesus. I really want you to see. Thank you, Lord. Oh, thank you, Jesus. Oh, it's Jesus. Oh, I really want to see. The more I see. Oh, thank you, Lord. Oh, the more I see of this old world, oh, the less it means to me. Oh, Jesus. I really want to sing. Oh, yes, it's Jesus. I really want to see. Hallelujah. Oh, it's Jesus that I really want to see. And the more I see of this world, the less it mean to me. For is Jesus that I really want to see. I trust that's who you come to see tonight. &gt;&gt; Not me, Lord. come to see him. &gt;&gt; Let's just go to the Lord in prayer. Gracious heavenly father, we come to you now, Lord God, tonight. We we count it an honor, Lord, to be standing here behind the sacred desk, Lord, and remember the words of the prophet of God where he said, "We'd never be no closer to heaven than we are when we're standing behind this desk." No closer, Lord. No, we can't be any closer to you than just now. So Lord, let us take that, Lord. And don't just let it be behind this desk, Lord. Let it be down each aisle and around each person here tonight, Lord. And may you give us strength tonight, Lord God, just to get oursel out of the way. And may the Holy Spirit now come, Lord. May you minister to hearts. May you change lives, Lord. May you give us victory in our lives, Lord God. I pray. And may Lord you start an oldfashioned revival. &gt;&gt; Lord may you start one here in Hardy. Lord &gt;&gt; Father and Worth. And God MAY IT JUST BLEED OUT INTO the neighborhoods. LORD BLEED OUT INTO our job sites and change lives around us. Lord God we come tonight not to see a man other than the Lord Jesus Christ. And Lord we know you're here. You promised you would be here where two or three would be gathered. Lord we're gathered in your name. We've invited you. We've sang the songs of Zion, Lord. We've we know you're here, God. So now, may you take the word, take the reading of the word, Lord. Take take the vessel, God. Get the vessel out of the way, Lord, that you could come minister to hearts and lives. We pray now. We give you all the glory, honor, and praise. Thank you for it in Jesus Christ's name. And the saints of God said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. Good to see everyone tonight. and and uh good crowd, brother Ben. Real good Wednesday night crowd. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. Took two churches to get it, but we got it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Certainly appreciate Brother Ben's invite. And uh we've known him for a long long time. I don't know how many years. He said 25 or 30 years. That's that's quite possible. we were pretty young and we was reminiscing about a time and I won't tell all the story but reminiscing about a time when we went to a uh took the young people from our church to Eureka Springs to see the Passion play and uh me and brother Ben we seen this church at the top of the hill and there was a bunch of cars there so we thought we'd go check it out and they were practicing church &gt;&gt; it was a biker church I think it was they were practicing for the service and when they kindly dismissed I, brother Ben said that I act like I got a phone call and we hight tailed it out of there and ran down the hill. But uh it was very odd. &gt;&gt; And we were thankful to to u for the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. So that we don't have to come and practice church, &gt;&gt; we come and live church. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. If you have your Bibles this evening, I'd like to turn to Psalms chapter 27 and verse 5 and then Matthew chap 7 and verse 24. Brother Ben used to preach at our church when he was young a whole lot &gt;&gt; when we were younger and then when he got a little older when he was at brother Ivy's he'd come up and preach for us and and uh it's just good to be together again in church that where we can press the battle &gt;&gt; and try to get out of here. Maybe 2026 will be the year of the rapture. &gt;&gt; The finishing of the rapture. &gt;&gt; Be wonderful. &gt;&gt; The Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For in the time of trouble, he shall hide me in his pavilion. In the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me. He shall set me upon a rock. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you. &gt;&gt; Or a revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Matthew chapter 7 verse 24. If you don't mind me taking my jacket off, it's but warm. People in my church complain about being cold. That's no joke. Matthew 20 Matthew 7 and 24. Therefore, whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them, I will liken unto a wise man, which built this house upon a rock. And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house, and it fell not, for it was founded upon a rock. &gt;&gt; Excuse me. And everyone that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built this house upon the sand. And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house, and it fell, and great was the fall of it. May the Lord Jesus add his blessing tonight. You can be seated. Thank you for all the specials tonight. And thank you, Sister Anna, for that last song. It goes with what I'm speaking on, Lord willing. And I want to speak tonight if I can on the winds of change. &gt;&gt; That's good. Amen. &gt;&gt; And somebody had asked me today, they said, "Well, are you you're going to have to preach a different thought than what you normally preach. Uh you can't you can't warm one up cuz half your church will be there." I said, "Well, I'm not warming one up." I was actually driving down the road the other day and Brother Jimmy, where are you at? Right there you are. you actually mentioned this title to me when brother Bryce Collins was at the church and the wind was really blowing hard outside and I gave him the title and he said well I was going to write down the winds of change but I'll go with his title instead and as I was driving down the road a couple of weeks ago after brother Ben had asked me to preach this thought just struck in my head and I I started studying and and you know the scripture here talks ABOUT THAT WE HAD TO BE BUILT ON A ROCK &gt;&gt; AND THE PROPHET OF GOD WOULD TELL US THAT A ROCK IS A REVELATION AND JESUS HERE IN THE SCRIPTURE was actually speaking of A STORM WHICH WAS GOING TO STRIKE. THE PROPHET SAID, "EVERY MAN and woman that's born in the world, THERE IS NO WAY OUT OF IT. NO WAY OF ESCAPE. WE ALL WILL HAVE A STORM TO STRIKE US &gt;&gt; SOMETIME OR ANOTHER." &gt;&gt; That's right. AND IT JUST DEPENDS ON WHAT KIND OF FOUNDATION YOU HAVE WHETHER YOUR HOUSE IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO STAND IT OR NOT. &gt;&gt; I say, LORD, LET ME BE UPON THE SOLID ROCK. THE REVELATION OF MALACHI 4'S MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; LET ME BE IN THIS WORD. &gt;&gt; A PART OF IT. &gt;&gt; COME ON. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; Pardon me. Brother Ben said I didn't need monitors, so I didn't I don't mean to scream. It's just who I is. Come on. &gt;&gt; AND YOU KNOW, THERE'S BEEN MANY LIVES SAVED BY preparations for storms. &gt;&gt; AND YOU KNOW, WHEN WINDS COME, and we we've had a lot of wind lately, and it changes the weather, &gt;&gt; AND IT BRINGS A CHANGE. WHEN FALL BEGINS TO COME, a lot of wind comes and the leaves fall. AND WIND IS ALWAYS BRINGING SOMETHING BEHIND IT OF A CHANGE. Come on. &gt;&gt; AND IF YOU'RE MADE, IF YOU'RE PREPARED FOR WHAT'S COMING, THEN YOU CAN SURVIVE WHAT IS COMING BEHIND IT. &gt;&gt; OTHERWISE, MANY LIVES ARE LOST BECAUSE OF FAILING TO TAKE HEED TO THE WARNING OF THE STORMS. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. BROTHER tells us of the story, and most of us probably know it, and if you don't, I'll just skip through it for a moment, of what happened in Florida one time. &gt;&gt; There was a great, he called it a typhoon. We know it today as hurricanes. that was fixing to sweep the land and and they were TOLD BY THEIR WEATHER PROPHETS THAT IT WAS COMING. &gt;&gt; I thought that was kind of astounding. Brother Ben, Brother Brandham called them weather prophets &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THEY COULD LOOK OUT AND SEE SOMETHING. &gt;&gt; Come on, &gt;&gt; BY WHAT INTELLIGENCE THEY HAD GIVEN TO THEM BY SCIENCE. AND WE'VE HAD PROPHET IN THIS DAY WHO DIDN'T HAVE NEED SCIENCE, BUT HE HAD THE EYES OF ALMIGHTY GOD TO LOOK INTO THE WORD AND BRING A REVELATION &gt;&gt; FOR US TO STAND UPON THE ROCK. &gt;&gt; Thank you, buddy. Is that your kid, Joel? He's a He's going to be a backer. &gt;&gt; Come on, preach. &gt;&gt; I love it when the kids start helping. Amen. &gt;&gt; So they had this storm coming and and he said, "I'm told the weather prophets, you know, you they were telling them how it was all going to happen and and then by calling ahead, they heard all the storms and the wind that was coming and when a hurricane comes in, it actually sucks up the water that is in the ocean or that is in was in this case was in partly in Lake Okachchobee and and and it takes a higher wind &gt;&gt; to turn the storm." The prophet said, &gt;&gt; "So, the storm was coming, BUT IF THERE'S NOT A HIGHER WIND TO COME &gt;&gt; TO TURN THE ONCOMING STORM, THEN YOU'RE going to meet it head on." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; AND HE SAID, "SO IS IT TODAY." &gt;&gt; AND WE ALL KNOW THERE'S AN ONCOMING STORM. HE SAID, "AND THE ONLY WIND THAT I KNOW THAT CAN TURN THE STORM WILL BE A RUSHING WIND THAT FELL ON THE DAY OF PENTECOST. THAT'S THE ONLY THING THAT CAN SAVE US &gt;&gt; IN THIS HOUR. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, LORD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO, THE STORM, YOU KNOW, WAS RAGING and the neighbor, one of them was a Christian man, a devout Christian, well known in his area, and he had uh he'd heard the weather. So, he went over to his neighbor who was a chicken farmer and he said, "Gather all your chickens, put them in your storm shelter, and come to mine." He said, "There's a storm coming." He said, "I ain't got time for that. I'm trying to make a living. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Watch now. He's got a warning. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "OH, THERE'S BEEN WARNINGS AND WARNINGS AND WARNINGS AND WARNINGS AND THERE'S BEEN TOLD US THERE WERE STORMS COMING BEFORE AND STORMS NEVER CAME." HE SAID, "BUT WHAT IF IT DOES COME?" &gt;&gt; OH MY, &gt;&gt; BROTHER. LISTEN, WE'VE BEEN BEING TOLD FOR 30, 40 YEARS THAT THE RAPTURE'S COMING AND IT MIGHT COME THE NEXT YEAR. WHAT IF IT DOES COME? &gt;&gt; WHAT IF IT COMES IN 2026? ARE WE GOING TO BE READY? YEAH, that's it. &gt;&gt; He said, "Well, if you're not going to come, at least let your family come." He said, "I'll have you to know my family's going to do exactly what I tell them." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I'm the bread winner. They're my wife's going to do what I tell her. The kids are going to do what I tell them. So, he pretty much ran the old guy off. And he gets home. And there's a lot of people still like that today. &gt;&gt; I remember a sermon one time, Brother Danny Steam preached for us, and it was hearkening to thy wife Sarah. It's what God told Abraham. Sometimes it's good to listen to your wife &gt;&gt; as long as it ain't contrary to the word. &gt;&gt; Well, that was for whoever. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; WHAT IF IT DOES HAPPEN? WHAT IF THERE IS A STORM COMING? &gt;&gt; WHAT IF IT BLOWS AWAY YOUR CHICKEN HOUSE? WHAT IF IT BLOWS AWAY YOUR FAMILY? THIS MAN WAS ONLY CONCERNED ABOUT HIS SELFISH MOTIVES. &gt;&gt; HE WAS NOT CONCERNED ABOUT HIS WIFE. HE WAS NOT CONCERNED ABOUT HIS CHILDREN. IF HE HAD HAVE BEEN, HE WOULD HAVE HEEDED THE WARNING. &gt;&gt; So the neighbor, he has to turn and leave. And before you know it, the storm struck. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "And all of a sudden, the clouds was up on him before they knew it." He said, "That's the way judgment strikes. &gt;&gt; IT'S ON YOU BEFORE YOU EVEN know it." &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh, you might laugh at THE MESSENGER AND YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO KILL HIM, BUT YOU CANNOT KILL THE MESSAGE." COME ON. &gt;&gt; LISTEN, THEY MAY HAVE BROUGHT THEY MAY HAVE TRIED TO CRITICIZE BROTHER BRANDHAM. THEY MAY HAVE TRIED TO MAKE WEBSITES AGAINST HIM. THEY'VE TRIED TO DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO DISCREDIT HIM. BUT YOU CAN'T KILL THE MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; Message lives. &gt;&gt; I had a man challenge me a younger guy one time. He was starting to question me. You know, he sent me all this text about all this bunch of nonsense and I said, "I ain't got time for it." &gt;&gt; He said, "Are you afraid of it?" I said, "I'm not afraid of anything you've got, buddy. &gt;&gt; Not afraid of none of the questions." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But I ain't here to ENTERTAIN QUESTIONS &gt;&gt; THAT SOMEBODY WHO IS AN UNBELIEVER TRYING to bring TRYING TO DOING NOTHING BUT BRINGING A REPROACH &gt;&gt; AND TRYING TO BRING DOWN WHAT I BELIEVE. &gt;&gt; LISTEN, I AIN'T GOT TIME FOR THAT. THE WORD WILL DEFEND ITSELF, &gt;&gt; I DON'T HAVE TO DEFEND THIS MESSAGE. GOD DEFENDS THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; SO, I took my little phone and I went block &gt;&gt; ain't got time to entertain the devil. Right. &gt;&gt; Had a pastor friend one time, brother Jason, my daughters, they got questions about all these things on, you know, all that junk. And I said, you ain't got all the answers for it. &gt;&gt; THIS IS A FAITH WALK. &gt;&gt; LISTEN, CHURCH, SOMEWHERE ANOTHER, YOU GOT TO GET A REVELATION UPON THE ROCK &gt;&gt; THAT IT DON'T MATTER WHAT ANYBODY ELSE SAYS. IT DON'T MATTER WHAT ANY WEBSITE SAYS. IT MATTERS WHAT DID THUS SAYETH THE LORD SAY. YOU CAN KILL THE MESSAGE, but you can kill the messenger. You can't kill the message. &gt;&gt; It'll go on just the same. GOD'S MESSAGE IS ETERNAL. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; AND HIS WORDS NEVER FAIL. &gt;&gt; LORD, &gt;&gt; PAUL WAS SUCCESSFUL IN HAVING STEPHVEN STONE, &gt;&gt; but all through his life, he surrendered. When he until he surrendered to Christ was he he was never able to get away from that message. Come on. &gt;&gt; When Steven said, "I see heavens open." &gt;&gt; And I see Jesus sitting at the right HAND OF GOD, &gt;&gt; THAT HAUNTED HIM UNTIL HE GAVE HIS LIFE TO GOD. &gt;&gt; LISTEN, CHURCH, SOMETHING HAD TO GET A HOLD OF HIM. AND IT WASN'T THE MESSENGER, IT WAS THE MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO, while the storms are sweeping on and the country and caught the guy's chicken house and blew it away and blew him away and they never found his body, his wife was frantic and fighting and she she got up on top of the roof of her house, her and her kids, and you know, she was there on Lake Okachchobee. And the lake itself is the deepest part is only nine foot deep. It's about average of three or four feet &gt;&gt; and it's massive. one of the biggest natural lakes there are. And and uh there's lots of the rocks and everything else sticking up and and don't ask me how I know that. I happened to hit a pile of them one time in a rented boat. &gt;&gt; Yeah. But there's always danger where you don't expect it sometimes. &gt;&gt; And here a man is warning a MAN OF ONCOMING DANGER AND HE REJECTS the warning. AND THEN HIS WIFE IS CAUGHT ON TOP OF THE ROOF WITH ALL OF HER KIDS. AND THEN BROTHER TELLS A STORY THAT COTTON MOUSE OR MOXICANS BEGAN TO BITE THE CHILDREN UNTIL THEY DIED. AND THEN THEY BIT HER UP UNTIL SHE DIED. AND THEY FOUND THEIR BODIES LAYING TOGETHER ON THE ROOF. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T TAKE A WARNING. &gt;&gt; BUT BEFORE, LISTEN CHURCH, BEFORE YOU CAN BE SAVED, THERE HAS TO BE A WARNING. THERE HAS TO BE A PREPARATION MADE FOR YOUR SAFETY OR THERE'S NO NEED OF SENDING OUT THE WARNING. &gt;&gt; AND THE WARNING IS ONLY A VOICE OF ONE HAVING YOU TO PREPARE FOR THE DANGER. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Then you have to make the choice. &gt;&gt; Either you believe it, &gt;&gt; the warning or you ignore it. &gt;&gt; Come on now. Come on. Do &gt;&gt; you remember brother said I went back and forth across this land preaching the gospel over and over and over and he was blasting bobbed women and and he would blast them and he'd come back and he go well it's worse this year than it was last year. &gt;&gt; LISTEN CHURCH, WE OUGHT TO BE FURTHER THAN THAT UP THE ROAD. &gt;&gt; OUR CHURCHES OUGHT TO BE GETTING BETTER YEAR BY YEAR, BROTHER BEN, AND NOT WORSE YEAR. I TRUST THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING TONIGHT IS WE'RE GETTING STRONGER AND STRONGER AND MORE READY TO LEAVE THIS WORLD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; You're either going to be a believer or an unbeliever. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; Or Brother Jason, what about the makebeliever? He's an unbeliever, too. &gt;&gt; He just make beliefs for a while. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You can't be both. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Or one or the other. &gt;&gt; The problem is is we got too much profession without a possession. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We got too many saying it and not enough living it. Right? &gt;&gt; We got too many practice sermons and not enough live sermons. &gt;&gt; It'd be a lot BETTER IF WE LIVED OUR SERMON AND THEN EACH ONE OF US WOULD BE A MINISTER. FOR THE BIBLE SAYS THAT WE ARE WRITTEN EPISTLES READ OF ALL MEN. &gt;&gt; LISTEN. AND ONCE WE'VE BEEN WARNED, THERE'S AN ONCOMING STORM. THE WINDS ARE HIGHLY. &gt;&gt; MAN JUST TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THE CHANGES WE SEEN IN 2025 WITH A NEW POPE AND things &gt;&gt; and a lot of other things. Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Perversion &gt;&gt; like crazy. &gt;&gt; Come on, preach. &gt;&gt; The wind's blowing. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; There's changes happening. &gt;&gt; Preach. &gt;&gt; Which side of the fence YOU GOING TO FALL ON? &gt;&gt; HUH? The winds ARE HOWLING IN THIS VERY HOUR. AND IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S UNCERTAINTY EVERYWHERE. &gt;&gt; BUT THERE SHOULDN'T BE UNCERTAINTY IN THE CHURCH. &gt;&gt; THIS OUGHT TO BE A PLACE WE CAN TIE DOWN TO. LISTEN, SOMETIMES THE WIND MAY KNOCK YOU DOWN IN A BLOWDOWN. &gt;&gt; BUT THOUGH YOU'RE IN THE BLOWDOWN, &gt;&gt; REMEMBER WHO YOU ARE. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT A CHATTER CHATTER PINE SQUIRREL. &gt;&gt; OH, NO. YOU'RE AN EAGLE AND YOU'RE NOT BORN TO BE IN THE BLOWDOWN. &gt;&gt; You're born to soar in the heavens. Right. &gt;&gt; And when you get in a blowdown sometimes, Brother Harvey, you've been in blowdowns &gt;&gt; out in Colorado. Some of you that's hunted out there, you can't walk through them. &gt;&gt; You can't hardly get around them. &gt;&gt; There trees just falling everywhere and you can't make your way through it. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said, "I was standing there and he said, I I looked around." Most of you probably know this story, but &gt;&gt; it's good. &gt;&gt; It's good. Come on. &gt;&gt; And he said, "I I just began looking around and looking at all the great things of God and and I just began shouting." &gt;&gt; And he said, "And I and a rainstorm blew IN AND I GOT BEHIND A TREE, BROTHER." AND I WAS SITTING THERE AND I WAS HIDING BEHIND THE TREE AND HE SAID, "ALL OF A SUDDEN, THE WINDS BE &gt;&gt; WIND BLOWS AND BLOWS THE STORM OUT AND THE SUN BEGINS TO SHINE." AND HE SAID, "THE BEAUTIFUL MOST BEAUTIFUL RAINBOW BEGIN TO COME ACROSS THE VALLEY." I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE EVER BEEN THERE AND SEEN THOSE, BUT THERE'S AIN'T NOTHING LIKE IT &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU'RE STANDING THERE LOOKING ACROSS THE VALLEY AND THERE'S SUCH A PEACE THAT COMES DOWN AND THERE'S RAINBOW. WE HAD THAT HAPPEN ABOUT TWO OR THREE YEARS ago in Colorado and I just sat there &gt;&gt; and you just have to weep. &gt;&gt; Brother Bam said, "I got I didn't get quite as excited as he did. It'd have been good to have probably, but I'd probably scared the other three guys to death. Brother B said, "I looked out there and I seen that rainbow and he said I was half Indian. Anyhow, my mother was a half breed and he said I had that Indian but in me and he said something began screaming out on the inside and I heard the old greywolf howl and I heard his mate howl down in the valley AND I COULDN'T STOP FROM CRYING &gt;&gt; BECAUSE I SEEN GOD EVERYWHERE." AND HE SAID, "AS I BEGIN TO SHOUT AROUND THE TREE," AND THEN I'D STOP AND THEN I'D SHOUT, ALL OF A SUDDEN I HEARD SOMETHING CHATTERING. &gt;&gt; We don't need none of this screaming. &gt;&gt; We don't need none of this shouting, &gt;&gt; chitter chatter. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Oh, you get the young people too worked up. &gt;&gt; Well, you get them worked up at A BALL GAME. &gt;&gt; WE GOT THEM IN CHURCH. WE'RE GOING TO LET THE SPIRIT WORK THEM UP. WE'RE NOT WORKING THEM UP BY MUSIC. WE WANT THE SPIRIT OF GOD TO FALL DOWN UPON THEIR LIVES AND FOREVER CHANGE THEM. &gt;&gt; Brother Jason, I've seen people get too wild. And &gt;&gt; I ain't ever &gt;&gt; Come on, &gt;&gt; I ain't ever seen anybody in here get too wild. &gt;&gt; Come on, preach. I've seen people shout that ain't never shouted before since. And when I see that, I say, "Yep, that's God." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Fall down on a person. We was at youth camp one year and there was a wind come through that building. Some of you kids were probably there. And all of a sudden, young man from Florida, he takes off running around the building. The next thing I know, there's a lady standing beside me and she went to dancing. And I just blocked the aisle &gt;&gt; and let her dance. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; Couple others in front of us got to dancing. The power of God begin moving, begin changing. There's a wind. YOU COULD LITERALLY FEEL SOMETHING GO THROUGH THE BUILDING. &gt;&gt; I'M TELLING YOU, CHURCH, IT'S NOT JUST A WIND ON THE OUTSIDE. THERE'S A HOLY GHOST WIND THAT OUGHT TO BE FLOWING IN OUR LIVES. &gt;&gt; IT OUGHT TO GIVE US SOMETHING TO SHOUT ABOUT. &gt;&gt; Tell somebody, you know, we you know, you got too much noise. &gt;&gt; It hurts my ears. &gt;&gt; Come on. They got earbuds, ear earplugs and things of that nature. If your ears are sensitive, we &gt;&gt; get you some. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come on. &gt;&gt; Help you. &gt;&gt; But don't try shutting down the moving of the spirit. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Cuz not everybody shouts like I get loud. Some people's quiet. Some people just raise their hand. &gt;&gt; I used to watch my dad worship. He'd sit over in my far right corner. He just raised his hands and tears just streamed down his eyes. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. That was as good to me as to run the aisles and swung from the fans &gt;&gt; cuz I knew there WAS SOMETHING GENUINE. &gt;&gt; LISTEN, CHURCH, THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. IF SOMEBODY GETS EXCITED IS WHO CARES IF IT'S GENUINE, LET THEM SHOUT. &gt;&gt; AND I AIN'T THE JUDGE IF IT'S GENUINE. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Truth, sir. &gt;&gt; I didn't mean to go there, but anyhow, &gt;&gt; come on. &gt;&gt; We're talking about the wind blowing. Yeah. &gt;&gt; There's a change happening. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; I'm trying not to go down a rabbit trail, but &gt;&gt; come on. &gt;&gt; Sometimes the Lord kind of directs you ways. You just have to kind of follow. &gt;&gt; You remember when brother Brandon was up there in that forest and it was burnt over and he said he got out there and he was riding on the horse and he got off and he heard all those old trees. They begin to creek and moan. &gt;&gt; An old weary &gt;&gt; sound. He goes, "This days of miracles are passed. &gt;&gt; There's no more healing." &gt;&gt; Hey, he was kindly feeling a little depressed. &gt;&gt; No doubt. HE'S LOOKING AT ALL THAT, BUT HE SAID, "ALL OF A SUDDEN, I LOOK DOWN UNDERNEATH AT THE UNDERGROWTH." &gt;&gt; If you've ever seen A FORCE BURN OVER, YOU SEE THE UNDERGROWTH WILL BEGIN TO GROW IN JUST A LITTLE WHILE. AND HE SAID, "I NOTICED WHEN THAT SAME WIND WOULD GO THROUGH THERE, THAT UNDERGROWTH WOULD BEGIN TO THEY BEGIN TO WAVE AND THEY WERE FROLICKING IN THE HOLY SPIRIT." &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; GOD, LET OUR YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE A CHANCE AT A REVIVAL. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; The prophet said it would be that way. So, we just believe that's how it's going to be. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And I just believe they're catching it. Come on. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; THERE'S YOUNG PEOPLE CATCHING IT. &gt;&gt; THERE'S YOUNG PEOPLE WHO LOVE TO BE AT CHURCH. THEY SIT ON THE FRONT ROWS OR SECOND ROWS AND THEY'RE NOT BACK THERE ON THE BACK ROW OUT THE BACK DOOR. LISTEN THAT. &gt;&gt; COME ON. &gt;&gt; SOMEBODY'S GOT TO SIT THERE. BUT IT AIN'T GOT TO BE ME OR THE YOUNG PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; I'M SORRY, brother Stewart. I ain't preaching at you, buddy. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; There's a place for it. &gt;&gt; But you GOT MEN LIKE THIS SITTING ON THE FRONT. Come on. Come on now. Huh? Don't get nervous. I ain't decided to use you yet. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; They going they got something to be happy about. Yes, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; Some of us are like, "Well, you know, when I when I when I first got saved, I jumped and shouted." Well, what does hinder you now? &gt;&gt; WHAT CHANGED? &gt;&gt; DID THE WORD CHANGE OR DID GOD CHANGE OR DID YOU CHANGE? &gt;&gt; I'LL TELL YOU WHAT DIDN'T CHANGE. HE IS THE SAME YESTERDAY, TODAY, AND FOREVER. AND HIS WORD DON'T EVER CHANGE. THANK YOU, &gt;&gt; LORD. &gt;&gt; SO, I began wondering, what's that little chitter chattered pine squirrel doing? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; He said, "I looked over there and I seen this great big eagle in a blowdown." &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Yep. He said, "That's why he seen that eagle." And he said, "And that eagle just looked at him. And then the eagle jumped up on the branch and he looked at me and he said, I said, "You know what, God? Why did you stop me from shouting to look at this eagle?" &gt;&gt; He said, "I began to admire him because he had courage." &gt;&gt; Oh, YEAH. &gt;&gt; LIKE ALL GOD'S children's got. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T FEAR HIM. HE SAID, "DON'T YOU KNOW, LITTLE EAGLE? I COULD SHOOT YOU BEFORE YOU COULD LEAVE." And the eagle just kept pulling on his wings. &gt;&gt; And he said, "And I wondered, what did you stop me for?" &gt;&gt; Yeah. And he said, "All of a sudden, God showed me." &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; When he was pulling at those wings, he was trusting in the gift that God had given him. &gt;&gt; HE WASN'T WORRIED ABOUT A RIFLE. HE WASN'T WORRIED ABOUT A CHATTERING SQUIRREL. HE WAS TRUSTING IN THE GIFT GOD HAD GIVEN HIM. &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S WHAT YOU AND I GOT TO DO WHEN YOU'RE IN A BLOW. NOW, TRUST IN WHAT GOD'S GIVEN YOU. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT, &gt;&gt; Lord J. God didn't give me no gift. You got the Holy Ghost. That is a gift. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; He said, "And all of a sudden, that eagle got tired of looking at me. &gt;&gt; He flopped his wings &gt;&gt; twice." &gt;&gt; Tuck off through the woods. &gt;&gt; Never had to hit his wings again. And he said he just begin soaring. And he'd catch a wave of wind and he'd soar a little higher. And he'd catch another wave of wind. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. And he just kept soaring a little higher. And he set HIS WINGS TO THE WIND OF FAITH. &gt;&gt; G &gt;&gt; AND BEGAN SOARING UP INTO THE HEAVENLIES. &gt;&gt; Thank you, JESUS. &gt;&gt; HE LEFT ALL THE EARTHBOUND CHATTER. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Well, don't you know? &gt;&gt; Our message church is better than yours. &gt;&gt; Oh, come on now. &gt;&gt; Come here, brother. we're going to go to this one or this one because they're better. Well, let me just tell you something. You go wherever you want to go. We really we don't care. We've done talked about this. We don't mind where you go to church. &gt;&gt; So, as long as you go &gt;&gt; because we got one thing in mind. That's to make you AND US IN THE GLORY. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; IS THAT RIGHT? THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; WE TALKED ABOUT THAT'S WHAT WE WANT. WE WANT A UNITY CUZ HOW BLESSED IS IT WHEN BROTHERS CAN DWELL TOGETHER IN THE SPIRIT OF UNITY. &gt;&gt; IT'S LIKE THE OIL. &gt;&gt; Thank you very &gt;&gt; We're one big family. &gt;&gt; You might be in Hardy and I might be at worth. We're still family. &gt;&gt; You know why? We're not family of Ben. We're not family of Jason. We're family of Jesus Christ. So, DON'T LET THE CHATTER &gt;&gt; COME ON. &gt;&gt; CHATTER STARTS IN CHURCHES. &gt;&gt; Come on. That's good. &gt;&gt; I don't know what goes on here. They didn't tell me. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; But I know humans. &gt;&gt; And we all battle the same bite fights. &gt;&gt; And this one, listen, let me just tell you something. We're one. And there ain't one person in this building that I wouldn't want to set across from the marriage supper of the lamb with. &gt;&gt; I don't KNOW OF ONE PERSON ON THE ENTIRE PLANET THAT I WOULDN'T WANT TO SET ACROSS FROM THE MARRIAGE supper of the lamb with. &gt;&gt; I told my church a couple of years ago, I think it was, I SAID, "WE DON'T KNOW. MAYBE GOD SAVED ADOLF HITLER before he died. AND IF HE DID, I WOULDN'T CARE TO SIT ACROSS THE TABLE WITH HIM. I DON'T CARE. SO, AS LONG AS WE MAKE IT, &gt;&gt; come on." Yeah. &gt;&gt; COME ON. PRAISE. &gt;&gt; FLY UP, LITTLE BRIDE. &gt;&gt; COME ON. &gt;&gt; DON'T LISTEN TO ALL THE GOSSIP OF THE WORLD. LISTEN TO THE VOICE OF THE WORD. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. GOOD. &gt;&gt; And the word says right away above every wave that comes. Just move up. Raise up higher. &gt;&gt; Higher. And just move out. I know it's the conditions of late Oian age that we live in that we're not supposed to be a part of, but we're in it &gt;&gt; that knocks us down in the blowdowns. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's true. &gt;&gt; You lose your job. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; you get knocked down. &gt;&gt; You lose your health sometimes and you get knocked down. Yeah, &gt;&gt; you might lose a loved one sometimes and you get your feet knocked down after you &gt;&gt; and you're laying there and you're thinking, "God, do you do you even love me anymore?" Let me tell you, &gt;&gt; he loves you. &gt;&gt; His love is not by how &gt;&gt; by how much you're BLESSED HERE NATURALLY. HIS LOVE IS THROUGH ELECTION. HE ELECTED YOU. THEREFORE, HE CALLED YOU. HE CHOSE YOU. THAT'S HOW YOU KNOW HIS LOVE IS BECAUSE HE SAID SO. IT DOESN'T MATTER NECESSARILY HOW I FEEL ABOUT IT. &gt;&gt; I JUST NEED TO START SOARING AGAIN. &gt;&gt; OH, there's times I &gt;&gt; How many in here's ever fell in a blowdown &gt;&gt; spiritually? Okay, &gt;&gt; I know most of you hadn't naturally spiritually. &gt;&gt; You've been down in there &gt;&gt; and you're struggling and some of you struggling right now. &gt;&gt; You don't know where you're going to go. Your your mind is tormented. LET ME JUST TELL YOU, THERE IS A MAN HERE &gt;&gt; WHO CAN TURN ON THE LIGHT. &gt;&gt; THERE IS A MAN HERE WHO CAN DRIVE OUT THE ENEMY. THERE'S A MAN HERE WHO CAN PUT THE DEVIL ON A FLEA. &gt;&gt; And there's a man here who wants to give you a testimony in 2026 that it'll be greater than your testimony in 2025. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Good. &gt;&gt; Read you this quote out of the oncoming storm. Prophet said, "We need some good old-fashioned backwood preachers &gt;&gt; that's got the Holy Spirit." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; THAT'S NOT AFRAID TO PREACH THE GOSPEL WITH bare hands &gt;&gt; and not cover up with some kind of a rubber glove, &gt;&gt; BUT PREACH THE COMING OF THE LORD Jesus and judgment for THE WICKED AND HEAVEN FOR THE RIGHTEOUS AND THE NEAR APPROACHING. &gt;&gt; WHAT SEASON? &gt;&gt; Season of change. &gt;&gt; COME ON. &gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW. NO ONE ELSE KNOWS. BUT I'LL WARN MY generation if it comes now. I want them to be warned. And if the prophet wanted his generation to war be warned, we ought to want our generation to be warned. &gt;&gt; Lot was warned. &gt;&gt; RIGHT? HE GOT THE MESSAGE FROM THE ANGEL. HE WAS WARNED. &gt;&gt; COME OUT OF THE SINFUL PLACE. AND JESUS Christ compared Sodom to this day. &gt;&gt; To this very day. &gt;&gt; Sinful. Oh, what we need is somebody to call people back to the word, &gt;&gt; BACK TO THE GOSPEL OF THIS HOUR, NOT BACK TO A DENOMINATION. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, CHURCH. You can belong to every denomination IN THE PLANET. IT WILL NOT SAVE YOU. YOU CAN GO TO EVERY CAMP MEETING. IT WILL NOT SAVE YOU. I LIKE GOING. YOU CAN GO TO EVERY CHURCH SERVICE. IT WILL NOT SAVE YOU. BUT WHAT WILL SAVE YOU IS WHEN YOU MEET JESUS &gt;&gt; FACE TO FACE. &gt;&gt; He changes you. &gt;&gt; He gives you victory. He gives you hope. He gives you peace. &gt;&gt; We need to call on him in the middle of the storm. &gt;&gt; In the MIDDLE OF THIS STORM, WE NEED STABILITY. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; WE NEED PEOPLE WHO'S NOT WISHY-WASHY. BROTHER, WE NEED CHURCH MEMBERS AND PREACHERS AND PASTORS WHO'S NOT WISHY-WASHY, BUT WE STAND ON TRUTH. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Stabilizers have been put on the ship. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Listen to this. &gt;&gt; I won't preach two hours. Joel, &gt;&gt; come on. &gt;&gt; Joel's done quit pulling. And he told me he was going to quit at 8:15. &gt;&gt; Preach, buddy. &gt;&gt; Stabilizers been put on the ship. Great fearful waves are out here before us. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; BUT WE KNOW JUST BEYOND the wave, we're nearing the shore. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; WE'RE NEARING THE STORM. &gt;&gt; LISTEN TO his words. JUST STAY STABLE. &gt;&gt; STAY IN THE WORD. STAY WITH GOD NO MATTER HOW YOU FEEL. &gt;&gt; WHAT ANYTHING ELSE? STAY RIGHT with the word. &gt;&gt; Let it stay stable. &gt;&gt; Stay balanced. &gt;&gt; When you see ALL THESE GREAT BIG OLD CLOUDS AROUND US, THE STORMS ARE COMING AND ATOMIC BOMBS AND EVERYTHING ELSE THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT, BUT OUR STABILIZER IS STRAIGHT IN THE WORD. &gt;&gt; GOD SAID IT WOULD BE THERE. WE'LL CREST EVERY ONE OF THEM. &gt;&gt; G. I like this promise. We'll go right over the top of them. &gt;&gt; They can't sink us. They can't drown us. &gt;&gt; You can put us in the grave. We're coming out again. &gt;&gt; And there ain't no way in the world TO KEEP IT DOWN THERE. WE'LL CREST EVERY ONE OF THEM BECAUSE OUR GREAT CHIEF CAPTAIN IS CALLING FROM THE OTHER SIDE. &gt;&gt; COME UP HIGHER. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Reminds me of the scripture in Matthew chapter 8 where they called Jesus on the scene in the middle of the storm. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; And he said, "Peace, be still." &gt;&gt; Lord, thank you. &gt;&gt; And they marveled. &gt;&gt; But then they marveled at a man whom they'd been around for three years almost. Why do we marvel when God does a miraculous? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; We ask him. Probably everybody in here has had a miracle &gt;&gt; and we see God move and and yet when he does it, we're just astounded. And then we had one little sister years ago, man, every time we'd go to pray for at the hospital, she'd get a miracle. And then one time she didn't. And she said, "Brother Jason, what's wrong? I'm not getting a miracle." &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; I said, "Sister, sometimes God gives a healing." &gt;&gt; And then you got to hang on. You got to wait then for God to come on. &gt;&gt; Listen church, we all like miracles, but what if God decides just to heal you? AND WHAT IF HE DECIDES TO LET US WALK THROUGH THIS BLOWDOWN FOR A WHILE AND BE HUNG UP IN THE TREES FOR A WHILE? &gt;&gt; BUT THERE'S A BRIDE RISING UP WHO'S GOING TO RECOGNIZE WHO SHE IS. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, LORD. RIGHT. And he rose and he rebuked the winds in the sea. And there was a great call. And they marveled that even the winds in the seas obeyed him. The ship is rocking. The winds are blowing. Satan's buffing him. And he's blow blow to blow and wave after wave &gt;&gt; AND YOU WENT THROUGH TRIAL AFTER TRIAL. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Am I the only one that had trial after trial? &gt;&gt; Oh, come on. &gt;&gt; Oh, no. We all did. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Trial after trial. Brother Joe, you didn't even know &gt;&gt; what to do many times &gt;&gt; cuz we don't always know what to do. &gt;&gt; And no, I'm not trying to discern Brother Joe. I just We're humans. &gt;&gt; That's what happens. &gt;&gt; We don't always know which decision to make. &gt;&gt; But we know one thing. THE FOOTSTEPS OF A GOOD MAN ARE ORDERED OF THE LORD. &gt;&gt; SO YOU WALK IN HOW GOD LEADS YOU. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, LORD. WHEN IT LOOKED LIKE ALL HOPES OF A REVIVAL WAS GONE, &gt;&gt; COME ON. &gt;&gt; THEN JESUS COME ON THE SCENE, &gt;&gt; testimonies were dying &gt;&gt; out. He said people'd rather stay home on Wednesday night. &gt;&gt; Watch television. He said, &gt;&gt; "Come on." &gt;&gt; Someone told me you couldn't preach against television anymore because everybody had them on their phones. &gt;&gt; I said, "Well, I guess we subtract 500 quotes." &gt;&gt; Oh my. Come on. I don't know what you do with them, but anyhow, &gt;&gt; do with them what you want. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Then they said, "Well, would Brother Brandham have a smartphone if he was here?" We don't know. He's not here. &gt;&gt; So, what do we got to do? We got to keep believing the gospel. &gt;&gt; Listen, don't get hung up on STUFF LIKE THAT. STAY WITH THE MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; LISTEN, JUST SAY WHAT HE SAID AND HE'LL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR IT. TESTIMONIES IS DYING OUT. THEY'D RATHER STAY HOME. NO MORE WEDNESDAY NIGHT TESTIMONY MEETINGS AND THINGS. NO MORE PRAYER MEETINGS. &gt;&gt; HE SAID THE ORES ARE BROKE. &gt;&gt; THE MASS HAS FELL. THE WINDS DONE KNOCKED THE SAILS DOWN. &gt;&gt; AND THE CARES of the WORLD WILL SOON KNOCK OUT YOUR TESTIMONY. &gt;&gt; Then I tell you what we need. He said is a revival. This is 1963. What you need is A REVIVAL. &gt;&gt; BROTHER DIXON, WHAT IS A REVIVAL? A TRUE REVIVAL IS WHEN MEN AND WOMEN COME BACK AND LINE UP WITH THE WORD OF THEIR DAY. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; And there will be a message to sweep out then. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; It's going to catch her. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And there's been a message, has there not? &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; And all hell may be breaking loose in your life right now. &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, there's a real change coming, too. &gt;&gt; And it ain't just a change of the weather. IT'S A CHANGE OF YOUR BODY. &gt;&gt; THERE'S A BODY CHANGE COMING. &gt;&gt; IT AIN'T GOING TO BE TOO MUCH LONGER. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Psalms 27:5, "For in the time of trouble, &gt;&gt; oh yeah, &gt;&gt; he shall hide me in his pavilion. &gt;&gt; In the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me. YEAH. &gt;&gt; HE SHALL SET ME upon a rock. &gt;&gt; It's pretty astounding to me, brother takes that verse and preaches the rapture sermon. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you tonight, there's a change in the air. &gt;&gt; It's rapture time. &gt;&gt; We're in the season of rapture. &gt;&gt; We're in the rapture, &gt;&gt; right? Three things had to happen when the rapture COMES. THERE WAS A SHOUT. WHAT WAS THE SHOUT? THERE'S A MESSAGE TO BRING FORTH THE LIVING BREAD TO CATCH THE BRIDE. &gt;&gt; RIGHT? THEN THE SECOND WAS A VOICE OF RESURRECTION. &gt;&gt; He said the same loud voice of St. John 11:38 and 44-44 THAT CALLED LAZARUS FROM THE GRAVE GETTING THE BRIDE TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, LORD. &gt;&gt; WHERE ARE WE AT, CHURCH? &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Wind's blowing. Yeah, &gt;&gt; Jason, there's going to be a rapture. &gt;&gt; Yeah. How do you know I'm in it? &gt;&gt; Well, how you in it? I'm part of it. &gt;&gt; Well, how can you be part of it? Because the prophet of God said when I received the baptism of the Holy Ghost, everything I had need of was in me right then. Even the rapture. &gt;&gt; SO, DON'T TELL ME THE RAPTURE IS A FUTURE DATE. THE RAPTURE IS A PROCESS THAT WE ARE IN TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; AND THE THIRD THING IS A TRUMPET WILL SOUND. &gt;&gt; YES. AND THE FEAST OF TRUMPET IS ALWAYS CALLING THE PEOPLE TO a supper. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; Soon the lamb will take his bride &gt;&gt; to be ever at his side. &gt;&gt; All the hosts of heaven will assemble me. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; A shout and a voice and a trump. And &gt;&gt; oh my brother Ben, I like this part when he says it. And Jesus does all three of them while he's descending. &gt;&gt; Come on. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So, where are we at? &gt;&gt; How close are we to the finishing of the rapture? &gt;&gt; LISTEN, CHURCH. THE WINDS ARE HOWLING AND AND THEIR ONCOMING STORM IS UPON US. BUT WE'RE GOING TO RISE &gt;&gt; AND WE SHALL BE VICTORIOUS OVER DEATH, HELL, AND THE GRAVE. &gt;&gt; LET ME JUST TELL YOU, IT'S GOING TO TAKE A STRONGER WIND &gt;&gt; THAN WHAT WAS IN 2025 TO BRING ME DOWN. IT'S NOT GOING TO BRING ME DOWN. &gt;&gt; I'VE RECOGNIZED WHO WE ARE. &gt;&gt; And by God's grace, &gt;&gt; let us be anchored &gt;&gt; deeper than we've ever been anchored. &gt;&gt; 2026, let this be the year of jubilee. &gt;&gt; SOME OF US HAVE BEEN BOUND. LET IT BE THE YEAR OF JUBILEE. SOME OF YOU IS BOUND BY SICKNESS AND DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY AND FEAR OR WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE. LET THIS BE THE YEAR YOU'RE SET FREE FROM IT. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, LORD. &gt;&gt; LET THIS BE YOUR VICTORY. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. THANK YOU, LORD. &gt;&gt; And there will be a sweep. &gt;&gt; You know what a sweep does? It makes another wind. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Brother said, "Can't you see we're at the end time? It's all over. The next thing will be a sweep that'll grab that little group together." &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; And in a month or so, SHE'LL BE GONE. OH, &gt;&gt; where are we at? &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right here, brother Jeremy. &gt;&gt; At the end. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I still remember that your you God got a hold of you, buddy. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; It's kind of a good thing your brother, your what is he? What's your uncle deceived you a little bit? &gt;&gt; Deceived him and got him saved. Told him they was going camping and they went to youth camp. And &gt;&gt; I remember, listen, this powerful testimony. &gt;&gt; He didn't expect the wind of change to come. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come on. &gt;&gt; HE THOUGHT HE'S GOING TO A PARTY. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; It was a party. All right. &gt;&gt; Going on in glory. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; First night, he's back there in the middle of the tent, sunglasses on his head. &gt;&gt; Danny Seaman's preaching. And you're sitting back there like that with the sunglasses on your head. Everybody knew who he was talking about. Next day he's up closer. I think ABOUT THE THIRD NIGHT HE'S RIGHT DOWN THERE. &gt;&gt; AND YOU KNOW WHAT? GOD CHANGED HIM. &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE WIND OF CHANGE I'M TALKING ABOUT. IT'S WHEN THE WIND OF THE HOLY SPIRIT COMES OVER A PERSON'S LIFE AND TRANSFORMS THEM. &gt;&gt; God so saved him, he got to marry the deacon's daughter. That's what God can do for you. &gt;&gt; It's going to take a stronger wind. Shake him off. &gt;&gt; Come on, &gt;&gt; preacher. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Jo, there might be a lot of problems, &gt;&gt; BUT NOTHING'S GOING TO SHAKE US &gt;&gt; OFF FROM SERVING GOD. &gt;&gt; LISTEN, THIS MESSAGE IS OUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Let this be a warning tonight. &gt;&gt; Let us run to Christ, &gt;&gt; church. Let us RUN TO HIM. LET US GIVE HIM EVERYTHING WE GOT. LET US GIVE HIM OUR ALL, LORD. LORD, LET US FALL IN LOVE WITH YOU ALL OVER AGAIN. &gt;&gt; OH, PREACHER, you don't KNOW HOW BAD I HAD IT this year, but you don't know how great God is. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Greater than all my trouble. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to sing for you. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; But God is greater. Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; There's young people sitting here right now God's dealing with. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; They've had a lot of storms, &gt;&gt; right? But &gt;&gt; there's a God here tonight &gt;&gt; who can take your storm &gt;&gt; and take your blow down and make you soar into the heavenly so high till everybody around you be like, "OH MY GOODNESS, WHATEVER THEY GOT, I WANT." &gt;&gt; LISTEN, CHURCH, THAT'S WHAT WE NEED IS TO LET WHAT YOU GOT GET ON YOUR NEIGHBOR AND ON YOUR OTHER NEIGHBOR. AND BEFORE LONG IT'S DOWN EVERY AISLE OF THE CHURCH &gt;&gt; TILL WE ALL &gt;&gt; FALL IN LOVE WITH JESUS. &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus. &gt;&gt; I say tonight God &gt;&gt; let us be ready. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; 2026 here the bride comes. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; Remember what brother Brandham said to Satan? Satan &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; be careful. COME ON. &gt;&gt; BE CAREFUL, SATAN. &gt;&gt; CUZ YOU'RE NOT MESSING WITH JUST ANYBODY. YOU'RE MESSING WITH GOD'S CHOSEN PEOPLE. AND IF THEY'RE GOD'S CHOSEN, GOD WILL FIGHT FOR THEM. HE'LL BACK THEM UP. HE'LL GO TO THE GULLY FOR THEM. HE'LL GO TO THE MOUNTAIN FOR THEM. HE THEM WAY DOWN TO HELL FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; He's God all the time. Would &gt;&gt; you sing that song again, Sister Anna? Oh, thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; That very song could have been my whole message tonight. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Don't let nothing and come on up. Shake you down. &gt;&gt; You stick with this word. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, people of the word of life tabernacle, you stay with your pastor. &gt;&gt; He's ordained of God to see you through. &gt;&gt; Amen. I mean that. &gt;&gt; And those aren't my words. Those are the prophet's words. &gt;&gt; And if God called you here, you stay here and you get behind him. And don't be a drag. &gt;&gt; Rod, if I drink this bottle. We're buddies. &gt;&gt; We're not going to let what anybody else does get between us. &gt;&gt; Brother Robert, you're in a storm right now. &gt;&gt; There's a God here. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; That can fix the heart problem. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; That can fix the blockages. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Good friend of mine the other night, we had prayer for him at church. Doctor said, "If you live the Tuesday, we'll do surgery on you." Tuesday, he goes and run the calf in. They said, "If if there's too many, we'll just do open heart surgery." They just knew he was plugged up. They said &gt;&gt; they got in there, see, &gt;&gt; no stance, no surgery. and they sent him home. Well, that same Lord Jesus can touch anybody in this building tonight. Let's &gt;&gt; stand. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; Withered force. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. People running to and fro. They don't know what's going on. Hearts are failing because of turmoil in the land. We just can't take a stand. But it's going to take a stronger wind than this to keep me from my promises. Going to take a stronger wind to turn me around. Going to take a stronger wind than this to keep this evil down. People are living no different than the world claiming to know the love but truly serving other gods. They call on him day and night but they don't produce no life. anointed on words at the end time. They're rejecting the Holy Ghost. But it's going to take a stronger to keep me from my promises. Going to take a stronger to turn me around. Going to take a stronger win cuz my feet are on solid ground. People are searching for the true and living God. There's a famine in the land and the word seems no more. They have eyes but cannot see. They have ears but cannot hear. If they only sp to keep me from my promises going to take a str to turn me around. Going to take a stronger wind to keep this eagle down. People are searching for the true and living God. &gt;&gt; There's a famine in the land. And the world seems nothing more. They have eyes but cannot see. They have ears we cannot hear. If they only description they know that Jesus Christ is here. It's going to take a strong to turn me around. Going to take a strong cuz my feet are on solid ground. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Thank you, Lord Jesus. If you just start to play something, I just want to give you an opportunity tonight. And I believe the presence of the Lord is here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a new year. We're going to start another year. And I've never ended a year that I didn't think, well, I could do this better or that better. And brother Jason said something tonight. And he said, "You know, we should be getting better, getting better every year." Now, I want us to have a just a season of prayer tonight. And if you want to come and pray, you're welcome to do that. This altar's open tonight. You're welcome to come pray. The Lord has touched you tonight through our brother's ministry. You're welcome to do that. Just kneel at the altar and pray if you want to come pray. But we're going to pray together and just have a season of prayer and just believe that, you know, 2026, we're going to be more dedicated. &gt;&gt; We're going to love people more. &gt;&gt; We're going to love each other, but we're going to forget about the past. &gt;&gt; Let it go. It's not helping you. Quit holding on to it. Just let it go. Move forward. Brother Bren said we don't turn over a new leaf in the new year, but we want the Lord to just come and and just use us more. And if there's anything in our lives that's not right, it's time to just let go of it, church, and and quit doing it and move on. Wouldn't that be good? Wouldn't that be good if we're doing something we know is wrong? Let's just quit doing it and be a Christian. If you need something from him tonight, why why don't you lay hands on one another tonight as you're standing there? And there's quite a few of us in the building tonight. Just lay hands on one another, brother to brother and sister to sister. I husband to wife. When you The Bible says they shall lay hands on the sick and thus shall recover. So if you're sick tonight, I believe there's healing in the building for you. &gt;&gt; And all of us need a closer walk with God, a rededication. Why don't Why don't you just ask him for it tonight in your own way as we pray? Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, as brother Jason preached tonight, a a voice of warning, Lord, and also Lord, a a call to a rapture, Lord, that we know has already begun within us. I pray God you would help us. We want to be more committed in the new year, Lord. We don't want to be the same as what we've been. We want to love more. We want to treat one another better. We Lord, we we don't want to repeat the failures of the past. Lord, there's young people here who may have failed in some way, but Lord, may this year be a year, oh God, that maturity begins to show up in their life and the Holy Ghost gets a hold of them, oh God. I pray you'd grant it today, Lord. I pray you would improve every home, Lord, that your spirit would be there. Maybe where there's been fussing and fighting, may it end tonight, Lord. and may your may may there be peace and harmony, oh God. Lord, where there's been a struggle, Lord, and and a trial, oh God, may you begin to bring victory in their lives. Lord, I pray for those that are sick. I think of several in the church tonight that wanted to be here and couldn't be. Lord, if they're watching this service, I pray, God, that you'd bless them tonight. I pray you'd heal them completely. We know cancer is nothing to God. We know diabetes is nothing to God. We we know heart trouble is nothing to you, Lord. And we pray, God, right now that you'd reach down and you'd heal those those that are sick, oh God. I pray for our our sister churches in the area, Lord. Especially those that have gathered with us tonight from Christian Tabernacle. I pray you'd anoint brother Jason, Lord. And I pray you'd anoint the services at the church, Lord. Bring a revival there. Oh God, we want one here as well, Lord. We want to see you move in this area, Lord. There's been so much the devil has gotten so much glory. We don't want to give him any more glory. We want you to get the glory in the coming years. I pray you'd grant it. Lord, I thank you for your presence tonight. Lord, we don't take it lightly. Lord, as brother Jason was talking about his father's as he was stood there in the corner and his hand would go up and tears would flow down his face cuz he had something on the inside that Lord that was touched by the hearing of the word. Lord, may it be so in every heart tonight. Lord, I pray you grant it. Oh God, may we worship you like never before, Lord, as we fellowship together. There's some food and things. I pray you'd bless it tonight and I thank you for it. Thank you for these people, Lord. We love them with all of our heart. Pray you bless them, Lord. And grant peace and strength in their homes in the coming year. We pray in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen. Do you love him tonight? You believe you've been helped tonight by the preaching of the word, by the worship? Let's just lift our hands. Spread your wings to the wind. Sing it now. &gt;&gt; Oh, you can fly in a higher place.
