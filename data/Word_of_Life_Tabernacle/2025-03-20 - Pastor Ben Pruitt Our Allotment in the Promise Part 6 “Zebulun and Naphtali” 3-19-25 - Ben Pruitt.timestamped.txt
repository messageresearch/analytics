[42:51] amen amen God bless you uh we're just
[42:56] glad to be in the house of the Lord
[42:57] tonight glad to be able to have church
[43:00] on a windy day day when there's fire in
[43:03] in the area but uh we're just believe in
[43:05] the fire of God will be here with us
[43:07] tonight good to see each and every one
[43:09] of our visitors Matthew chap 4: 12-16
[43:14] we're going to continue on our series uh
[43:17] with uh continue on our series with the
[43:21] tribes of Israel uh tonight we going to
[43:24] take just a little bit different uh
[43:25] approach and and talk about zebulun and
[43:28] and and Nepal
[43:32] it says Matthew 4:12 now when Jesus had
[43:34] heard that John was cast into prison he
[43:37] departed into Galilee and leaving
[43:41] Nazareth he came and dwelt in capernium
[43:43] which is upon the Sea Coast in the
[43:46] borders of zabulon and nepalm
[43:50] that it might be fulfilled which was
[43:53] spoken by Isaiah the prophet saying the
[43:56] land of Sab
[43:57] and the land of nephelim by the way of
[43:59] the sea Beyond Jordan Galilee of the
[44:03] Gentiles the people which sat in
[44:06] darkness saw great light I was
[44:09] identified with that scripture the
[44:11] people which sat in darkness saw great
[44:14] light and to them which sat in the
[44:16] region and shadow of death amen they
[44:19] were in the shadow but the reality of
[44:22] the lights is sprung up amen God bless
[44:25] you you can have your seat tonight
[44:31] as we look at these tribes uh I I don't
[44:34] want you to get discouraged brother Wes
[44:38] it's so good to see you tonight God
[44:40] bless you thank you all for being here I
[44:42] don't want you to get discouraged by uh
[44:46] the things that we've read and the
[44:48] things that we've studied because many
[44:51] of the tribes didn't fulfill their
[44:54] purpose and and the prophecy that was
[44:57] was made over them of what they should
[44:59] do and what they should be many of them
[45:02] left things on the table they they
[45:04] didn't exactly do what God had told them
[45:07] to do and yet we realized that that was
[45:11] just a shadow of things to come that
[45:14] there would be a bride at the end time
[45:17] that would not leave anything any stone
[45:19] unturned would not leave any promise
[45:22] unfulfilled but there had to be you see
[45:24] Christ all of these things were
[45:27] fulfilled in Christ all of this was a
[45:30] shadow of Christ and he was the perfect
[45:33] one that come but as there was a perfect
[45:35] groom there would have to be a perfect
[45:37] bride it could not be perfect by our own
[45:40] Merit but we're perfected by the blood
[45:42] of the Lamb we've come through the doors
[45:45] we talked about Sunday morning and the
[45:47] welcome matter of the blood of Jesus
[45:49] Christ was was laid there for us and we
[45:51] went through the door into fellowship
[45:53] with God and and and since we are in
[45:56] fellowship with him we are going to
[45:58] fulfill all that he spoke about us I'm
[46:01] so glad for that and so we don't have to
[46:03] say well I wonder if I can do it no you
[46:06] can do it and we don't preach a gospel
[46:08] of Doom or Gloom or or maybe or ifs or
[46:12] questions we we preach a sure word of
[46:15] Prophecy random even told us he said
[46:17] that there's no negativity in the gospel
[46:20] at all he said it's all positive it's
[46:22] yay and amen Jesus said why is it that
[46:25] way because the bride is going to make
[46:27] it you're going to be there you're going
[46:29] to be there you say well brother brother
[46:30] man if you preach that people won't try
[46:32] we don't try because we're worried we
[46:34] might not make it we try because there's
[46:37] something in our heart we love him with
[46:39] all of our heart we're we're his wife we
[46:41] want to we want to do what he says to do
[46:46] good so these tribes maybe wouldn't
[46:48] fulfill all that they were called to do
[46:50] but somebody will and I believe that
[46:52] somebody is you and ien and so because
[46:55] he is the perfect fulfillment Paul says
[46:58] in Colossians 2:16 let no man someone
[47:01] say no man no man therefore judge you in
[47:05] meat right tell you well you know you
[47:08] shouldn't eat pork you shouldn't eat
[47:09] this shouldn't eat that he said let no
[47:11] man judge you in meat or in drink or in
[47:15] respect of a holy day or the new moon or
[47:18] the Sabbath days which are a shadow a
[47:22] shadow someone say a shadow shadow a
[47:25] shadow of things to come but the body is
[47:28] of Christ brother brand says all the old
[47:31] things of the Old Testament was only a
[47:35] shadow of the new things that's a sermon
[47:38] right there someone could preach old
[47:40] things are a shadow of the new things to
[47:43] come those things happen back there to
[47:46] give us the for knowledge of what we
[47:48] might expect in this day so it happened
[47:51] to give us the forn knowledge of what we
[47:53] might expect if we serve the Lord and
[47:56] what we might expect if we do not serve
[47:58] the Lord yeah right he says and if if we
[48:02] serve him now look there is a way that
[48:05] we can serve him with our whole heart or
[48:07] half-heartedly so he said these things
[48:10] happen for a shadow to show us what we
[48:12] might expect if we do not serve the Lord
[48:15] and if we serve him half-heartedly or
[48:18] wholeheartedly I want to follow after
[48:20] him with my whole heart don't you I want
[48:22] to give him my all because if you serve
[48:24] him half-heartedly there there's
[48:26] actually you'll only fulfill so much of
[48:29] the promise but the bride will not be a
[48:32] leot to see and lukewarm powerless
[48:34] formal Church they will not be that but
[48:36] the bride will will give him their whole
[48:39] heart he will not have a wife at the end
[48:42] time that doesn't get I'm so glad for
[48:44] that I'm so glad for that promise today
[48:46] that we can f we can fulfill all the
[48:48] word of God up to up to the very fact of
[48:52] the change of our body we will there
[48:54] will be a bride standing on that day
[48:56] that said we not all sleep but we shall
[48:57] all be changed in the moment in the
[48:59] twinkling of an eye somebody's got to do
[49:01] it might as well be us
[49:04] he said these happens for a shadow to
[49:07] show us what would we might expect
[49:11] come on church I could preach there for
[49:12] a while but we don't have time on
[49:14] Wednesday night but we can expect
[49:15] certain things if we serve him
[49:17] wholeheartedly and other things if we
[49:19] serve him halfheartedly
[49:22] Paul said these things happen for an
[49:23] example
[49:25] now we know that that FY as we get into
[49:27] it tonight was the Second Son of BHA
[49:30] Rachel's servant and Genesis 30 and7 is
[49:33] where he was born in verse eight it says
[49:36] and Rachel said with great wrestling
[49:39] have I wrestled with my sister that's
[49:41] with Leah I have prevailed and she
[49:44] called his name neph remember there was
[49:47] a lot of tension in the home because
[49:50] Jacob had one too many wives
[49:53] and that'll always cause tension
[49:55] and nap means my wrestling now keep that
[49:59] in the back of your mind my wrestling
[50:02] this is the tribe that would be most
[50:03] closely associated with the Sea of
[50:07] Galilee if you look at a map I don't
[50:09] even think I brought a map tonight but
[50:11] if you look at a map of of Israel it's
[50:13] the one that's most closely associated
[50:15] with the Sea of Galilee listen to what
[50:17] Moses said about naal when he spoke
[50:21] about this tribe he said of Napal he
[50:23] said oh Napal satisfied with favor
[50:28] satisfied with favor and full with the
[50:31] blessing of the Lord and then he said
[50:35] possess thou the west and the South and
[50:37] if you go look at the original is
[50:39] possess the border of the lake of
[50:41] Galilee
[50:43] zebulun was Leah's youngest son or sixth
[50:45] son Leah in Genesis 30:19 conceived
[50:49] again and be Jacob the sick son and Leah
[50:52] said God hath endued me with a good dowy
[50:55] now will my husband dwell with me
[50:57] because I had born him six Sons she
[50:58] called his name zebulun which means
[51:01] habitation
[51:02] habitation or dwelling place so Jacob's
[51:06] blessing over zebulun had to do with
[51:08] their physical uh location in fact in
[51:12] Genesis 49:13 he said zebulun shall
[51:14] dwell at the Haven of the sea and he
[51:17] shall be for a Haven of ships and his
[51:19] border shall be unto zidon and zebulun
[51:22] is actually landlocked by Ty and zidon
[51:25] on one side and Mediterranean Sea and by
[51:28] uh the tribe uh the other tribes on on
[51:31] on the other side towards the Sea of
[51:33] Galilee but they were a seafaring people
[51:35] they were fishermen and and so keep that
[51:37] in your mind as well now you'll find
[51:40] that all of the disciples come from the
[51:44] region of Galilee which would have been
[51:46] zebulun and NEP NEP except for one
[51:49] somebody know who the one is Judas
[51:53] Judas is the only one that doesn't isn't
[51:55] a Galilean
[51:57] so Jesus grew up in this region of the
[52:00] country and I I just I'm I I just think
[52:03] that's a simple explanation for why it's
[52:06] called the habitation of God cuz Jesus
[52:09] grew up there and lived there it was
[52:10] literally the habitation of God but now
[52:13] we look at Napal again and he said Napal
[52:16] is a hind let loose or deer dough let
[52:19] loose he giveth goodly words if you look
[52:23] at that it's a it's a deer released from
[52:25] bondage yeah to begin to produce goodly
[52:29] words or produce other translation
[52:32] actually says fawns
[52:34] and I'm building up to something tonight
[52:35] so don't go to sleep on me so in Luke
[52:38] chapter 4 and verse1 14 we find Jesus
[52:41] beginning uh his ministry and as he he
[52:44] starts in that region of the country it
[52:47] says Jesus returned in the power of the
[52:49] spirit this is after the Temptation the
[52:52] power of the spirit into Galilee and
[52:53] there went out a Fame of him through all
[52:55] the region round about he taught in
[52:58] their synagogues being glorified of all
[53:00] he came to Nazareth which would have
[53:02] been in zebulun where he had been
[53:04] brought up and as his custom was he went
[53:06] into the synagogue on the Sabbath day
[53:08] and stood up to read and there was
[53:10] delivered unto him the book of the
[53:12] prophet Isaiah when he'd opened the book
[53:14] he found the place where it was written
[53:16] the spirit of the Lord is upon me
[53:18] because he has anointed me to preach the
[53:21] gospel to the poor he has sent me to
[53:23] heal the brokenhearted to preach
[53:25] Deliverance to the captive recovering of
[53:27] sight to the blind to set at Liberty
[53:29] them that are bruised to preach the
[53:30] acceptable year of the Lord he closed
[53:32] the book and he gave it again to the
[53:33] minister and sat down and the eyes of
[53:35] all them that were in the synagogue were
[53:36] fastened on him and he began to say unto
[53:38] them this day is this scripture
[53:41] fulfilled in your in your ears what was
[53:44] happening the shadow was becoming
[53:47] reality what the what the law could not
[53:51] do and that it was weak to the flesh God
[53:53] sending his own son in the likeness of
[53:54] sinful flesh forcing condemned In the
[53:56] Flesh what was he doing he was bringing
[53:58] from a negative to a positive from a
[54:01] shadow to a reality and he was saying
[54:03] this is really I'm the Fulfillment of
[54:06] all the blessings given by Jacob to the
[54:09] 12 tribes I oh church I hope you're
[54:11] hearing me today he was the word he was
[54:14] all of it he said in the volume of the
[54:15] book it's written of me and so he stood
[54:18] up there and said this day this
[54:21] scripture is fulfilled the shadow become
[54:24] reality Galilee of the Gentiles which it
[54:26] was called that because it had so many
[54:28] cultural influences and different
[54:30] Gentiles people lived there Galilee of
[54:33] the Gentiles saw a great light and Jesus
[54:38] actually lives in that country we find
[54:41] he was born in Bethlehem but he grew up
[54:43] in Nazareth after leaving Egypt he went
[54:45] to Egypt for a while and come back to
[54:47] Nazareth leaving Nazareth he come and
[54:49] dwelt in capernium so he would go from
[54:51] zebulun to Napal which is upon the Sea
[54:55] Coast and the borders of Zebulon and
[54:57] nepon you talk about blessed
[55:02] no wonder it said that the the favor of
[55:04] God was upon them yes why because Jesus
[55:08] when God come down in flesh he chose to
[55:11] live right there in their towns right
[55:13] there in their communities you realize
[55:15] how blessed we are in this hour and I've
[55:18] told you this before but it just right
[55:20] now it just comes to my heart how
[55:22] blessed we are to live in this area that
[55:23] we live in because when God came down in
[55:26] our age
[55:29] he come down and worked through a
[55:31] prophet's Ministry the man wasn't God
[55:33] but God came down and visited our day he
[55:36] said I he'll rise with healing in his
[55:38] wings and he did where did he come right
[55:40] into our area
[55:42] right right down in Jonesboro right
[55:44] where some of y'all live and he come
[55:45] right into our area and he preach the
[55:47] word of God and we're blessed by that
[55:50] church many of you are third and fourth
[55:52] generation fifth generation Believers
[55:54] because this area was visited by the
[55:57] power of God God's favor was upon them
[56:02] oh my but we find that though they had
[56:04] the Jesus as their next door neighbor
[56:07] yet they turned him down
[56:10] you imagine what that must have been
[56:11] like that Jesus actually lived down the
[56:14] street and when he went to the grocery
[56:17] store he would have rubbed shoulders
[56:18] with them they would have talked to him
[56:21] they would have but many of them didn't
[56:22] even recognize who he was they didn't
[56:25] even they couldn't even see pass the
[56:27] veil of the flesh they they knew that he
[56:30] was a local they knew he talked like
[56:32] them he acted like them and somehow that
[56:34] hid him from them they could not see who
[56:37] he was and they accepted his ministry
[56:39] for a while as long as he was in healing
[56:42] but when he begin to declare who he was
[56:44] and say this day this scripture is
[56:46] fulfilled they begin to reject him out
[56:48] of that area
[56:50] and in fact Jesus it gets so bad that
[56:53] Jesus in Matthew 11:23 says Thou caper
[56:57] capernium was maybe the greatest City in
[57:00] this area of zebulun and Napal which AR
[57:03] exalted unto Heaven shall be brought
[57:05] down to hell for if the mighty Works
[57:08] which have been done in thee had been
[57:09] done in Sodom it would have remained to
[57:11] this day they have much to answer for I
[57:14] wonder church if we don't have much to
[57:16] answer for because of the favor that's
[57:19] been shown to us what have we done with
[57:22] it all right if we just turn it into
[57:24] squabbles and fighting and and fussing
[57:26] and and talking about people and running
[57:29] people down and and and fights between
[57:31] preachers and fights between churches
[57:33] and fights within churches that's not
[57:36] what he's wanting he didn't visit us so
[57:38] we could fight with one another he
[57:40] didn't visit us so we could remain in
[57:42] sin and and keep doing what we were
[57:44] doing he visited us so we would repent
[57:46] and come to him and spread this gospel
[57:49] that we've been given
[57:53] amen absolutely he visited us for a
[57:55] reason yes sir he always comes for a
[57:57] reason every time he comes in he comes
[58:00] for a reason oh I want to take advantage
[58:01] of it oh yeah I want in our services to
[58:04] take advantage of his visitation if he
[58:07] come he come for a reason if he's here
[58:09] tonight he's here for a reason I want to
[58:11] take advantage of that Lord if you're
[58:13] here there must be a reason if I don't
[58:15] have a need in my life maybe all I need
[58:17] to do is just worship you and lift my
[58:19] hands to you I don't want to P you to
[58:21] pass me by Lord in this situation I I
[58:24] don't want to just let you be the the
[58:26] guy at the market that I saw one day or
[58:28] the guy I know lives down the street I
[58:30] want you to know that you're here if
[58:32] you're here I want to be at your
[58:33] doorstep I want to I want to fellowship
[58:35] with you I want to entertain you yes as
[58:39] we heard the other night I I want to
[58:41] wash your feet yeah if he was in Simon's
[58:44] house he was there for a reason it was
[58:46] for that prostitute woman that was
[58:48] willing to see past all of the all of
[58:51] the things that was going on and had the
[58:54] time to make him welcome say let's make
[58:56] him welcome tonight what about you
[59:01] the fact that he came from Galilee was
[59:04] actually a stumbling block to the Jews
[59:07] it's like being from Hardy
[59:09] Walnut Ridge
[59:13] Roxy
[59:16] it was a stumbling block
[59:18] right because every time they said Jesus
[59:20] of Nazareth they like where
[59:25] where you remember the time that Jesus
[59:27] stood up at the feast in John chapter 7
[59:31] he he stands there and say of any man
[59:33] thirst all right let him come to me and
[59:36] drink out of his belly will flow rivers
[59:37] of Living Water right and and many
[59:41] people when they heard that it says in
[59:43] John 7:40 of a truth this is the prophet
[59:47] yes others said this is the Christ but
[59:51] some said shall Christ come out of
[59:53] Galilee oh my
[59:56] well it's exactly the place he said his
[59:58] favor would be on
[1:00:00] it's exactly the place where he said it
[1:00:02] there will be a release from bondage and
[1:00:05] goodly words will come out yeah right
[1:00:08] exactly the place where he said that
[1:00:10] that that would happen and it happened
[1:00:12] exactly in the right place but they
[1:00:15] didn't see it because their Creeds kept
[1:00:18] them from it they were blinded to it it
[1:00:20] said ha not I wonder tonight church if
[1:00:22] there's things that our Creeds are our
[1:00:24] message creeds hav't kept us from
[1:00:26] recognizing his presence here in the end
[1:00:29] time that he's right here Among Us
[1:00:33] yes about it amen oh my many of the
[1:00:37] people said it was a prophet some said
[1:00:39] it was Christ they said shall Christ
[1:00:41] come out of Galilee hath not the
[1:00:42] scripture said look how they use the
[1:00:44] scripture yeah against Christ that
[1:00:47] Christ cometh of this of the seed of
[1:00:50] David they say he got to come out of
[1:00:51] Judah well he was of the seed of David
[1:00:54] right but he grew GRE up in a place that
[1:00:58] obscured his identity yeah Hallelujah it
[1:01:02] was God hiding himself in Simplicity
[1:01:06] listen Maybe you come from a background
[1:01:08] that was inauspicious maybe you come
[1:01:10] from a family that was broken maybe what
[1:01:13] did it do it obscured your identity it
[1:01:16] wasn't the real you really he was the
[1:01:19] lion of the tribe of Judah really was
[1:01:21] the lamb that would come but they didn't
[1:01:23] see it CU all they could see is the sin
[1:01:25] in Nazareth and many times all people
[1:01:27] can see is where you're from and your
[1:01:30] story and what you went through but
[1:01:32] that's not the whole story and I'm so
[1:01:33] glad for that tonight I'm glad brother
[1:01:35] the JT that there's more to the story
[1:01:37] than what my past was I'm glad there's
[1:01:39] more to the story than where I was from
[1:01:42] but I'm glad that I found out my real
[1:01:44] identity was in him
[1:01:47] amen
[1:01:49] hallelujah
[1:01:51] aren't you glad aren't you glad that
[1:01:53] brother Joe that your past is not who
[1:01:55] you really are yeah I'm glad of that
[1:02:03] some of them there was a division among
[1:02:05] the people because of him some of them
[1:02:08] would have taken him but no man laid
[1:02:10] hands on him then came the officers to
[1:02:12] the chief priests and Pharisees they
[1:02:14] said unto them why have you not brought
[1:02:16] him the officers answered never man
[1:02:18] spake like this man and the Pharisees
[1:02:20] said are you also deceived are you a
[1:02:22] part of that cult
[1:02:25] we think this stuff is new it's not new
[1:02:27] all right huh everybody falls to Pieces
[1:02:29] cuz somebody writes an article or
[1:02:30] somebody puts something on the Internet
[1:02:32] that's what they did back then all right
[1:02:34] right they still defamed his name they
[1:02:36] still threw dirt on him but he was no
[1:02:38] less God he was still the same yesterday
[1:02:41] today he was still the the god of the
[1:02:43] universe
[1:02:45] wrapped in flesh
[1:02:49] true pH they said are you also in that
[1:02:52] cult are you also deceived if any of the
[1:02:54] rulers or the Pharisees believed on him
[1:02:57] so have any did this great preacher or
[1:03:00] that great preacher believe on him said
[1:03:03] but this people who knew not the law are
[1:03:04] cursed Nicodemus saith unto them he that
[1:03:07] come to Jesus by Night being one of them
[1:03:10] he said does our law judge any man
[1:03:11] before it hear him and know what he
[1:03:12] doeth and they answered and said to him
[1:03:15] art thou also of Galilee
[1:03:19] that's all they could see yeah all right
[1:03:21] but if they can really see the
[1:03:22] scriptures this is what I want to get to
[1:03:24] you tonight if we could just see there
[1:03:25] was a meaning to that him being there he
[1:03:28] was supposed to be there that's supposed
[1:03:30] to be where he come from that's the
[1:03:32] region that was supposed to see a great
[1:03:34] light
[1:03:35] brother brandom tells us this he said
[1:03:36] there's nothing out of cater we get all
[1:03:40] confused and worried and and thinking
[1:03:42] all things are not happening the way
[1:03:44] they ought to they're happening exactly
[1:03:45] the way they're supposed to happen
[1:03:48] nothing out of cater there's a reason
[1:03:50] why the Rapture didn't take place in
[1:03:52] 1977 I wasn't even born yet all right
[1:03:55] brother Andrew wasn't even thought of
[1:03:56] yet there's a reason why it didn't take
[1:04:00] place in 1986 come on Church there's a
[1:04:03] reason why things didn't work out the
[1:04:05] way maybe we thought it would work out
[1:04:06] there's a reason why things happened the
[1:04:08] way they did and the way the reason why
[1:04:11] we're all here tonight even with the
[1:04:12] weather the way that it is there's got
[1:04:14] to be a reason for it God don't do
[1:04:16] nothing halfhazard he does what he does
[1:04:18] on purpose and he does it right on time
[1:04:21] then we might as well accept the fact
[1:04:23] that he is here he might have come out
[1:04:25] of Nazareth but he came he might have
[1:04:27] Come From Galilee but he came I'm so
[1:04:29] glad that he came and if he came here
[1:04:32] tonight let's look past all of the dirt
[1:04:34] and the dust and things and say Lord I
[1:04:36] accept the fact that you've come I
[1:04:38] accept your presence and I'm willing to
[1:04:40] worship you I'm willing to bow down
[1:04:42] before you
[1:04:44] hallelujah
[1:04:46] hallelujah
[1:04:48] amen
[1:04:49] John 752 said out of Galilee ariseth no
[1:04:53] prophet
[1:04:57] they said the prophet's supposed to come
[1:04:58] out of Judah he did but not the way they
[1:05:01] thought all right
[1:05:05] all of Jesus disciples were galileans as
[1:05:07] we said except Judas
[1:05:10] the galileans had a particular speech
[1:05:14] it's like a bur in their speech
[1:05:15] historians tell us it was it must have
[1:05:17] been something like a Scottish person
[1:05:20] would sound to us or maybe just the
[1:05:22] difference between hardy and West Plains
[1:05:24] you know do you know there's a language
[1:05:27] difference between hardy and West Plains
[1:05:29] there is just you cross into Arkansas
[1:05:32] and people get more Southern as soon as
[1:05:34] you crossed the line
[1:05:36] and uh some of y'all grew up in Colorado
[1:05:39] so you have a completely different way
[1:05:41] of speaking
[1:05:43] but it's just the area they were from
[1:05:46] and in having that different speech you
[1:05:49] know it must have sounded
[1:05:51] grading
[1:05:53] uh uneducated right right right remember
[1:05:56] it said these are galileans
[1:05:58] right they they're ignorant and
[1:06:00] unlearned
[1:06:01] I I looked that up one time and it's
[1:06:03] literally idiots
[1:06:06] they were calling them idiots they're
[1:06:07] just dumb right they're ignorant and
[1:06:10] unlearned they they don't they don't
[1:06:12] talk right but there was something about
[1:06:14] them that God that's who God chose now
[1:06:18] we find that in in Matthew 26 at Peter
[1:06:21] you remember the story of Peter and I'm
[1:06:22] moving fast through this you can go and
[1:06:24] study it later but you'll find that
[1:06:26] Peter one time was uh was there at a
[1:06:30] fire and Jesus had been taken into
[1:06:33] prison and he wanted to see what would
[1:06:35] happen with him but he didn't want him
[1:06:37] to know who he was cuz he was afraid he
[1:06:39] might get taken too and he was a bit of
[1:06:41] a coward yeah so the big Fisherman's
[1:06:44] warming his hands over the fire and and
[1:06:47] someone comes up to him and says aren't
[1:06:49] you a Galilean
[1:06:51] aren't you one of them and he said no
[1:06:55] man I'm not one of them
[1:06:58] whatever it is whatever their that
[1:07:01] failed miserably whatever their accent
[1:07:03] was
[1:07:05] I was trying I was riding one time with
[1:07:07] a translator in West Africa and we we're
[1:07:09] we're traveling in by car and the pastor
[1:07:12] didn't speak English at all and his son
[1:07:14] was trying to translate for me and and
[1:07:16] and he was have kept having to ask me
[1:07:18] and I said do you do you not understand
[1:07:20] English he said I do but not your kind
[1:07:25] he was taught The King's English
[1:07:29] but they come to Peter when he sat there
[1:07:31] and and in Matthew 2673 and after a
[1:07:34] while came unto him they that stood by
[1:07:36] when he denied him once twice three
[1:07:40] times and said to Peter surely thou also
[1:07:43] art one of them for thy speech berth
[1:07:46] thee it betrays you
[1:07:49] but I love the fact that the Holy Ghost
[1:07:52] changes
[1:07:53] your speech amen all right now think
[1:07:56] about it for just a minute before
[1:07:58] Pentecost Peter had the same accent
[1:08:01] right he's from the same area but he's a
[1:08:04] coward and he's cussing
[1:08:09] come on I know no one here ever did that
[1:08:15] but he's he's cussed them out he's he's
[1:08:17] already a preacher but he don't have the
[1:08:19] Holy Ghost we've seen that before all
[1:08:20] right
[1:08:23] and he's and he's he he's in a terrible
[1:08:26] condition
[1:08:28] right I'm glad that there's still mercy
[1:08:30] and Grace
[1:08:32] for people who make big mistakes
[1:08:36] but he was in bondage to that old nature
[1:08:39] on now it hadn't been changed cu the
[1:08:40] Holy Ghost had not yet come but Jesus
[1:08:43] told him he said I prayed for you he
[1:08:46] said the devil would like to sift you
[1:08:47] like wheat but he said I prayed for you
[1:08:49] he said and when you're converted I love
[1:08:51] that he didn't say if but he said when
[1:08:54] you're converted strengthen your
[1:08:55] brethren
[1:08:58] so Peter's words were negative
[1:09:02] I'm going somewhere with this cuz I want
[1:09:03] to pick up a little bit on it Sunday
[1:09:04] morning Peter's words were negative
[1:09:09] to in that situation because that's what
[1:09:12] he was yeah right out of the Treasure of
[1:09:15] his heart he's speaking negativity
[1:09:18] saying I'm not one of them I don't know
[1:09:19] him he denied him right but after
[1:09:24] Pentecost at pentec C he was released
[1:09:27] sir to speak goodly words
[1:09:31] right to speak present truth come on Tre
[1:09:34] you can all fellowship with me on that
[1:09:36] thought one day you were in bondage one
[1:09:39] day I was in bondage and our speech gave
[1:09:41] us away
[1:09:43] as to who we were we were our old nature
[1:09:45] we were the old man but one day
[1:09:47] something happened and now we find
[1:09:49] ourselves fellowshipping around the
[1:09:50] message of the hour speaking a different
[1:09:52] language than what we used to speak in
[1:09:55] the world might look at us and say what
[1:09:56] in the world is that where does that
[1:09:58] come from well it's there it comes from
[1:10:00] the fact that that we have been changed
[1:10:04] we've been let loose
[1:10:06] what did he say na said you going to be
[1:10:08] like a a dough let loose that's where
[1:10:11] Peter was from yeah he was released
[1:10:15] to speak goodly words
[1:10:18] amen he was let loose to speak present
[1:10:20] truth the spirit of the one who spoke at
[1:10:24] Nazareth
[1:10:25] was now in Peter speaking goodly words I
[1:10:30] believe it'll change the way you speak
[1:10:32] around the house I believe it'll change
[1:10:34] the way you talk to each other I believe
[1:10:36] it'll change the way you speak to your
[1:10:37] children if you ever get the Holy Ghost
[1:10:40] really in your heart and he begins to
[1:10:42] speak through you you yield yourself to
[1:10:44] that acts chapter 2 and verse 6 the
[1:10:47] Bible says here here they come out of
[1:10:49] the upper room staggering out like drunk
[1:10:51] men and women too and they're just just
[1:10:54] staggering all around and and under the
[1:10:57] influence of the Holy Ghost and when
[1:11:00] they did that you know it probably be
[1:11:02] out of order today but it wasn't out of
[1:11:04] order then I don't believe it's still
[1:11:06] out of order today if we got a real good
[1:11:08] dose of the Holy Ghost yeah and they
[1:11:11] were just under the influence of it
[1:11:13] they're making a lot of noise and people
[1:11:15] come around to see it right and in Acts
[1:11:17] chapter 2 and verse 6 now when this was
[1:11:19] noised abroad the multitude came
[1:11:21] together we're confounded because that
[1:11:23] every man heard them speak
[1:11:26] in his own language
[1:11:28] oh my with a Galilean accent right
[1:11:32] think about it because it says they were
[1:11:34] all amazed and Marvel saying one to
[1:11:36] another behold are not all these which
[1:11:37] speak galileans
[1:11:40] so they could tell they were From
[1:11:41] Galilee yeah but they weren't speaking
[1:11:45] what they were speaking before but they
[1:11:48] were speaking goodly words true words
[1:11:52] and was actually being translated by the
[1:11:55] Holy Spirit into the ear of the people
[1:11:58] that were listening so the accent was
[1:12:01] still there yes right that's how they
[1:12:05] knew they were galileia the accent was
[1:12:06] still there but the words were different
[1:12:12] and brother brandom I don't want to get
[1:12:13] ahead of myself but we may talk about it
[1:12:15] on Sunday but brother brandham said that
[1:12:16] when you are converted he said first you
[1:12:19] think it he said and then because
[1:12:21] something happens inside of you then you
[1:12:23] think it he said and then you speak it
[1:12:24] and then you manifest it right if you
[1:12:27] think it then you speak it then you
[1:12:29] manifest it oh church that's exactly
[1:12:33] what they did they it come up but where
[1:12:35] did the thinking come from it was the
[1:12:36] Holy Ghost in them that caused them to
[1:12:38] have thoughts and then words and then
[1:12:40] manifestation yes so that's good now in
[1:12:44] Acts chapter 2 verse 8 says how hear we
[1:12:46] every man in our own tongue wherein we
[1:12:48] were born these are Gans jump to verse
[1:12:50] 12 it says they were all amazed we in
[1:12:52] doubt saying one to another what meth
[1:12:54] this yeah yeah others mocking said these
[1:12:56] men are full of new wine but Peter
[1:12:59] standing up with the 11 lifted up his
[1:13:01] voice sir what did he do he lifted up
[1:13:04] his voice begin to say goodly words
[1:13:08] why he had been released
[1:13:11] and it changed the way he talked about
[1:13:14] his situation he wasn't scared of the
[1:13:17] Romans no more he wasn't scare the Jews
[1:13:20] no more but he said actually you
[1:13:22] crucified him
[1:13:25] he actually indicted that generation
[1:13:28] because his words had been changed but
[1:13:30] he stood up and lifted up his voice said
[1:13:32] to them you men of Judea and all ye that
[1:13:34] dwell in Jerusalem be this known unto
[1:13:36] you and hearken to my words who is this
[1:13:40] guy the same guy that was always putting
[1:13:41] his foot in his mouth all right yeah
[1:13:44] right the same guy that could never say
[1:13:45] a right word could never say the right
[1:13:47] thing at the right time only one time
[1:13:50] and that was God speaking through him
[1:13:52] that was a revelation of the Holy Ghost
[1:13:54] yeah but but he could not other than
[1:13:56] that it seemed like he always said the
[1:13:57] wrong thing but here he's speaking
[1:14:00] goodly words why he he was let loose to
[1:14:04] speak the words of God to those who s in
[1:14:06] darkness light had come and he said this
[1:14:09] is that why was he saying the same thing
[1:14:11] Jesus said when he stood there and said
[1:14:13] this day this scripture is fulfilled
[1:14:15] Peter stood up on that day and said this
[1:14:17] is that which was spoken what was it he
[1:14:20] could speak goodly words because he had
[1:14:22] been released to do it yeah amen now are
[1:14:27] you with me so far
[1:14:31] to those who sit in darkness light had
[1:14:34] come but aren't we living in a day of
[1:14:37] light Oh my he said but brother Ben
[1:14:39] there's Darkness out there this is
[1:14:41] really a simple thought I know you kind
[1:14:42] of we went around the around the block
[1:14:45] to get here but if if this is a promise
[1:14:48] that was given to a tribe yet maybe
[1:14:50] unfulfilled
[1:14:51] but yet it was fulfilled in Christ right
[1:14:55] but in our day this was written of us
[1:14:57] arise shine Isaiah 61 for thy light is
[1:15:00] come and the and the glory of the Lord
[1:15:03] has risen upon thee if our light has
[1:15:06] come shouldn't our speech amen be
[1:15:09] changed on in Luke 4:22
[1:15:13] it says all bearing witness that's what
[1:15:15] we read a little bit ago wondered at the
[1:15:17] gracious Words which proceeded out of
[1:15:20] his mouth and they said is not this
[1:15:22] Joseph's son they just couldn't see it
[1:15:24] but they knew the words were good yeah
[1:15:27] brother Brandon one time was setting up
[1:15:30] a prayer line at the Tabernacle do I
[1:15:31] still have your attention I forgot to
[1:15:33] set my timer so but we're we're doing
[1:15:36] good some people he said this he was
[1:15:39] setting up a prayer line at the tabern
[1:15:41] because brother brandom actually had
[1:15:42] prayer lines yes yes he did right he did
[1:15:47] it's why we have them CU we had a good
[1:15:49] example yes but the B says some people
[1:15:52] gets the wrong impression of what the
[1:15:54] anointing is de said did you ever think
[1:15:56] of that when was the greatest anointing
[1:15:58] ever give to anyone and what did they do
[1:16:02] when they had the anointing
[1:16:05] he said the greatest anointing that was
[1:16:07] ever given to anyone was Jesus Christ we
[1:16:09] have the spirit by measure he had it
[1:16:11] without measure and one day he entered
[1:16:14] into the temple and picked up the scroll
[1:16:16] and read and said the spirit of God is
[1:16:18] upon me for he has anointed me to preach
[1:16:20] the acceptable year to bind up the
[1:16:21] broken hearts to heal the sick give
[1:16:23] sight to the blind he said now we would
[1:16:25] think if such anointing was on him had
[1:16:28] been prophesied 800 years before that it
[1:16:31] would come and here he was with that
[1:16:34] type of anointing the full blessing
[1:16:37] someone say the full blessing full bless
[1:16:39] an anointing of the Lord upon him we
[1:16:41] would want him to we would want to run
[1:16:42] all over the building scream and holler
[1:16:46] right and there' be nothing wrong with
[1:16:47] that but that's not the anointing that's
[1:16:49] the blessing of God but the Bible said
[1:16:52] he laid down the scroll and sat down yes
[1:16:55] sir come on we need to bring back that
[1:16:57] kind of preaching I'm just kidding
[1:17:01] and precious words proceeded it was a
[1:17:03] joke precious words proceeded from his
[1:17:07] mouth yes all right
[1:17:09] oh my listen what he says that's what he
[1:17:12] done under the anointing the anointing
[1:17:14] is not emotion the anointing is supreme
[1:17:17] power in control knowing exactly what
[1:17:23] and how
[1:17:25] oh church that's where we're coming to
[1:17:28] that's what's got to be fulfilled in the
[1:17:29] bride we're bringing it from the Old
[1:17:32] Testament coming right into our day
[1:17:34] what's our position what are we supposed
[1:17:36] to do yeah right he said that's what's
[1:17:39] here yeah
[1:17:41] brother Andrew you can preach that
[1:17:43] sometime

[1:17:47] anointing that brother brandom talked
[1:17:48] about that Jesus had he turns right

[1:20:25] it's a it's more than a statement on
[1:20:27] it's a production of something yeah if

[1:20:37] some translations in fact in the
[1:20:39] Amplified it says nap is a h Lo which

[1:21:04] and then words came yeah there had to be
[1:21:06] freedom in your life and then goodly
[1:21:08] words came now look it's a product of
[1:21:10] the releasing of the prisoner yes so we
[1:21:13] see Peter before Pentecost Peter after
[1:21:15] Pentecost Peter's no longer under
[1:21:16] bondage to negativity neither should we
[1:21:19] be come on he's no longer under bondage
[1:21:21] to fear neither should we be all why
[1:21:24] have we been let loose
[1:21:29] he doesn't have to be afraid of saying
[1:21:31] I'm a Believer he doesn't have to be
[1:21:32] afraid of saying I believe in Jesus I
[1:21:35] believe the message of the hour he
[1:21:36] doesn't have to be afraid when he prays
[1:21:38] over his lunch he don't have to be
[1:21:39] afraid to tell his friends who he is he
[1:21:41] don't have to be afraid why because he's
[1:21:44] no longer under bondage to to a thought
[1:21:47] that would produce a word of negativity
[1:21:49] but he's but he got something in him
[1:21:50] that produces a word yes that's good yes
[1:21:54] amen before pentecost's words condemned
[1:21:56] him look at this in Matthew 12:35 a good
[1:21:58] man out of the good Treasure of the
[1:22:00] heart bringeth forth good things right
[1:22:04] and an evil man out of the evil treasure
[1:22:06] bringeth forth evil things right right
[1:22:08] but I say unto you that every Idol words
[1:22:10] that men shall speak they shall give
[1:22:12] account thereof in the day of judgment
[1:22:14] for by thy words thou sh be justified by
[1:22:17] thy words thou sht be condemned listen
[1:22:19] to the way brother Brown explains it he
[1:22:20] said what is a convert a convert means
[1:22:22] to change something over and your
[1:22:24] thoughts your habits your being has been
[1:22:28] changed from a sinner to a Christian are
[1:22:32] you still with me tonight do we love the
[1:22:33] word do we still love the word i i
[1:22:37] church I just I just want to I want to
[1:22:39] fellowship with people who love the word
[1:22:41] I want to go to church with people who
[1:22:42] love to hear the word what is a convert
[1:22:45] it's your thoughts your habits your
[1:22:46] being has been changed from a sinner to
[1:22:48] a Christian first thing you know it in
[1:22:49] your heart first thing you know it in
[1:22:51] your heart then you express it with your
[1:22:53] lips and then it material realizes and
[1:22:55] that's what you are
[1:23:00] better watch what we say
[1:23:02] right a good man out of the good
[1:23:04] Treasure of his heart speaks good things
[1:23:09] he said now if you think that you think
[1:23:11] it what a word but you imagine you think
[1:23:14] it and you express it and it doesn't
[1:23:17] materialize
[1:23:19] then you're on the wrong road
[1:23:21] cuz if it it was come from the good
[1:23:23] Treasure of your heart it'll produce
[1:23:26] what it's saying yeah so it won't be
[1:23:28] just words but it'll be a life
[1:23:33] amen it's good he said look he said if
[1:23:35] you imagine you're a Christian you speak
[1:23:37] it out with your lips but you find out
[1:23:38] you're not you better get your thoughts
[1:23:40] changed and get your heart changed
[1:23:43] because it doesn't bear the record it
[1:23:45] doesn't bear fruit of it but the fruit
[1:23:47] of the spirit is gentleness
[1:23:49] Oh My
[1:23:52] Oh you mean the fruit of the spirit is
[1:23:54] not getting on the phone telling
[1:23:55] everybody everything everybody's doing
[1:23:56] wrong
[1:23:58] through the spirit's gentleness
[1:24:02] boy I could just stop and preach there
[1:24:03] for a while
[1:24:06] peace
[1:24:08] longsuffering
[1:24:10] goodness Mercy Faith he said if every
[1:24:14] little thing comes along sir and you fly
[1:24:17] up at it better be careful
[1:24:20] make excuses for your temper God don't
[1:24:23] allow it
[1:24:25] you say well I'm a human being I got
[1:24:26] temper absolutely but you need to repent
[1:24:28] if you lose control of it cuz that's
[1:24:31] Insanity
[1:24:33] try it go find out what brother Brandon
[1:24:34] said about that so there's something he
[1:24:36] said that was legion's problem said he
[1:24:39] just had a bunch of temper devils
[1:24:42] and it produces Insanity
[1:24:45] something hasn't happened you're
[1:24:46] expressing something here he said that's
[1:24:49] not here you're expressing something
[1:24:51] here that's not here Jesus said to the
[1:24:53] Pharisees you hyp hites how can you say
[1:24:55] good things that's what made them a
[1:24:57] hypocrite they thought one thing in
[1:24:59] their heart and expressed their lips
[1:25:01] with something else you can say whatever
[1:25:03] you want to I believe the message I
[1:25:05] believe brother brandom is right I
[1:25:07] believe he's 100% right I believe he's a
[1:25:09] prophet right but does your life
[1:25:11] materialize that
[1:25:14] right do we do what he says it's one
[1:25:16] thing to say it it's another thing to do
[1:25:19] it because he didn't say if you if you
[1:25:23] just repeat after me me Watch What
[1:25:25] Happens he said if you listen to my
[1:25:26] words if you do what I said
[1:25:30] are you with me now he said now he said
[1:25:34] that's what makes you a hypocrite foroud
[1:25:35] of the abundance of the heart speak the
[1:25:36] mouth you don't speak what you really
[1:25:37] think you must someone say must say what
[1:25:41] you think if you don't say it see speak
[1:25:45] your words let them come from the bottom
[1:25:48] of your heart he uses the uh expression
[1:25:52] or the the illustration of Jesus
[1:25:53] speaking to the tree he said then let
[1:25:55] that be pure let your thoughts run pure
[1:25:58] your Expressions pure live pure and be
[1:26:00] pure he said now out of your heart
[1:26:02] proceedeth evil thinking adultery all
[1:26:04] these different things if that comes out
[1:26:05] of your heart that's what's in your
[1:26:07] heart but if out of your heart comes
[1:26:09] righteous peace love joy oh my then it's
[1:26:12] coming from a resource here that's made
[1:26:14] up of that he said see what I mean it's
[1:26:16] made up of the spirit of God here that's
[1:26:18] expressed itself through the work and
[1:26:20] what you say then what you say will come
[1:26:24] to pass
[1:26:27] oh my goodly words
[1:26:30] from a heart that's been released to
[1:26:33] speak it
[1:26:37] Hallelujah why because the habitation of
[1:26:41] God is there sir remember it was it was
[1:26:44] Peter that was wrestling wrestling with
[1:26:46] God trying to wrestle with God didn't
[1:26:49] understand but one day receiv received
[1:26:50] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then
[1:26:52] what happened he's be to speak good
[1:26:54] goodly words he said then you just he
[1:26:56] said if you're trying to impersonate
[1:26:57] you're just making a hypocrite out of
[1:26:58] yourself cuz you can't do that
[1:27:00] Christianity has to come from the heart
[1:27:02] Jesus speaking to the Pharisees said you
[1:27:04] Hypocrites how can you say good things
[1:27:07] he said out of the abundance of the
[1:27:08] heart out of the abundance of the heart
[1:27:10] speak of the mouth then if the heart
[1:27:11] thought one thing and the mouth spoke
[1:27:13] something else it becomes hypocrisy
[1:27:15] we must from our heart Express exactly
[1:27:20] how we feel
[1:27:22] that's what worship is church
[1:27:25] we're not worshiping because of an
[1:27:26] external influence we're not worshiping
[1:27:29] we don't lift our hands just cuz
[1:27:30] somebody tells us to but we lift our
[1:27:32] hands even in the hard times we worship
[1:27:35] Paul and Silas worshiping even in the
[1:27:36] jail cell there there's something going
[1:27:38] on why because it's something from their
[1:27:41] heart it come out of their heart a song
[1:27:43] come out of their heart you may not feel
[1:27:46] much like worshiping tonight but there's
[1:27:48] something in your heart and it expresses
[1:27:50] through your mouth through the fruit of
[1:27:53] your lips he said we must express it
[1:27:55] from our heart if we can't express the
[1:27:57] right thing then keep still
[1:28:00] he said don't say nothing about it boy
[1:28:04] wouldn't that change things
[1:28:06] sir
[1:28:08] listen to this statement this is
[1:28:09] wonderful he said now if the church ever
[1:28:12] gets to practicing that
[1:28:15] they'll have they might have fewer
[1:28:16] members for a while but they'll have
[1:28:19] better members
[1:28:22] while they're having it
[1:28:24] God grant the day when every man or
[1:28:27] woman all right will be and express
[1:28:32] just what they are when Peter spoke and
[1:28:35] said I don't know him he was just
[1:28:37] expressing what he was Gile Darkness
[1:28:42] yeah but the people that sat in darkness
[1:28:45] right saw a great light yes
[1:28:48] amen and when his nature was changed out
[1:28:51] of his heart
[1:28:53] and to his thinking and out on his lips
[1:28:56] come goodly Words which were backed up
[1:28:58] by a manifestation of the Holy Ghost
[1:29:01] because acts 10:44 tells us while Peter
[1:29:04] yet spake these words the Holy Ghost
[1:29:08] fell on all them which heard the word he
[1:29:10] was speaking there at cornelius's house
[1:29:12] and and as he preached to them and told
[1:29:14] them the promises of God the Holy Ghost
[1:29:16] actually fell during the preaching all
[1:29:19] right I believe that's what ought to
[1:29:20] happen every service I believe the Holy
[1:29:22] Ghost ought to be present in our
[1:29:24] preaching in everything that we say
[1:29:27] yes brother BR said therefore we should
[1:29:30] never speak anything but what we believe
[1:29:32] and understand Let It Be pure and
[1:29:34] undefiled and holy let our conversations
[1:29:37] be clean and pure I say help me Lord our
[1:29:39] thoughts thinking the best thing
[1:29:42] thinking God's thoughts staying upon
[1:29:45] God's program and away from the things
[1:29:47] of the world right again he said this he
[1:29:49] said it's a strange thing that this is
[1:29:51] so much thought of people they say well
[1:29:53] I'm weak my faith is not very much I'm
[1:29:55] not a very good Christian that's just
[1:29:57] what the devil wants you to say you're
[1:30:00] just talking his language right then you
[1:30:03] mustn't never say that don't never
[1:30:05] someone say never never let your
[1:30:07] testimony be negative let it be positive
[1:30:10] all the time I am saved I have God in my
[1:30:13] heart could that be the fruit of our
[1:30:14] lips tonight I have God in my heart I
[1:30:16] believe him with all my heart do you
[1:30:18] believe in Divine Healing with all my
[1:30:20] heart let your testimony always in your
[1:30:23] thoughts everything never permit a
[1:30:25] negative thought to come in your mind if
[1:30:26] you can help it when it starts that
[1:30:28] don't entertain it oh my people have
[1:30:31] become so negative about a move of the
[1:30:33] spirit and that's why it it never works
[1:30:36] around them because they become so
[1:30:38] negative about it that they can't even
[1:30:40] experience it anymore I say let it be
[1:30:42] positive I believe I believe my kids are
[1:30:44] going to get some help when Camp comes
[1:30:46] along I believe that because I believe
[1:30:48] God is good enough that he can find a
[1:30:50] way to get the message to them and then
[1:30:52] goodly words will produce a reaction in
[1:30:54] their life and the presence of God will
[1:30:56] anoint that place I believe in every one
[1:30:57] of our church services that miraculous
[1:31:00] things can happen why not because of me
[1:31:02] but because I I have a positive
[1:31:04] testimony about the word
[1:31:09] good something inside of me says
[1:31:13] come on Church
[1:31:16] something inside of me says that our
[1:31:17] young people are not going to leave all
[1:31:19] right we're not going to lose another
[1:31:21] Generation by the Dell in this area
[1:31:23] we're not going to do it yeah
[1:31:25] sir how about let's just not do it say
[1:31:28] brother Ben that's off with bold words
[1:31:29] how about let's just let's just keep our
[1:31:31] words let's just let it come from the
[1:31:33] heart
[1:31:35] I don't want to lose another generation
[1:31:37] right I'm tired of the fighting in the
[1:31:40] fussel all right all right this come
[1:31:41] from my heart tonight I'm tired of it I
[1:31:44] don't want to see it no more and those
[1:31:46] you said well those thoughts come yeah
[1:31:48] they'll come he said you can't help the
[1:31:50] other thoughts from coming the thoughts
[1:31:51] from coming he said but that'll be like
[1:31:53] the farm that said he couldn't stop the
[1:31:55] birds from flying over his place but he
[1:31:57] sure could stop them from roosting
[1:32:01] you can't help the thoughts when they
[1:32:02] come but don't entertain them just pass
[1:32:04] it on see cuz that didn't come from your
[1:32:06] heart that thought that tells you you're
[1:32:07] not good enough that thought that tells
[1:32:09] you you're not saved that thought that
[1:32:10] tells you young people to commit suicide
[1:32:12] and and give up on the gospel and leave
[1:32:14] and go out here in the world that
[1:32:16] thought didn't come from God it come
[1:32:18] from the devil we need to take that and
[1:32:20] blast it out of the sky with the shotgun
[1:32:23] with the double barrel shotgun of the
[1:32:24] Old and New Testament find out what God
[1:32:26] Said you really are
[1:32:29] yes sir he said don't entertain them
[1:32:31] just pass it on no sir Jesus Christ is
[1:32:33] my savior All Things Are Mine by God and
[1:32:36] I'm going to keep them amen oh I love
[1:32:39] that all things are mine but the second
[1:32:41] part of that is I'm going to keep them
[1:32:43] I'm not going to let the Philistines
[1:32:45] come in and take my territory I'm not
[1:32:47] going to fail to to make my bord secure
[1:32:50] I'm going to make sure because this is
[1:32:51] the age that he called for full fulfill
[1:32:53] fillment of the word this is the age of
[1:32:56] fullness this isn't the age of a halfway
[1:32:58] backslid church it's that in the natural
[1:33:01] it's that in the layo the sins but not
[1:33:03] in the bright we've not been called to
[1:33:05] serve God half-heartedly we've been
[1:33:07] called to serve him with all of our
[1:33:09] heart
[1:33:11] that's right
[1:33:14] excuse me for yelling at you on a
[1:33:15] Wednesday night but we're almost done
[1:33:20] all things someone say it with me all
[1:33:21] things are Mind by God and I'm going to
[1:33:24] keep them
[1:33:30] oh that change our lives if we just
[1:33:31] testify that way I'm going to testify of
[1:33:35] them and God can only bless you sir as
[1:33:38] you confess
[1:33:40] that he has done it for you
[1:33:43] see he's the high priest of our
[1:33:46] confession sir he can only do for us yes
[1:33:50] sir as we accept it and confess
[1:33:55] see that that that deer had to be
[1:33:57] released
[1:33:58] David talked about the deer thirsting
[1:34:01] for the water as the heart thirst after
[1:34:03] the water broke so thirst my my my soul
[1:34:06] after you oh God he's thirsting for
[1:34:09] water being chased by hounds of hell as
[1:34:12] brother Brandon put it so eloquently
[1:34:14] but once the water is found sir the deer
[1:34:18] is released
[1:34:20] from the fear
[1:34:22] to finally fulfill its purpose purp yeah
[1:34:25] and I believe that Jacob was speaking to
[1:34:27] his son NEP and he's saying there will
[1:34:29] be Darkness because they went through a
[1:34:31] if you look at the history of it we
[1:34:33] didn't get into it tonight but there's
[1:34:34] was much Darkness they the tribe
[1:34:36] basically got wiped out and in the wars
[1:34:39] and things like that and and actually
[1:34:41] they they were kind of lost and it it
[1:34:43] was a bad situation
[1:34:46] but he said I you know you you're going
[1:34:47] to go through some things there's going
[1:34:49] to be some Darkness but Isaiah would say
[1:34:51] the people who said in darkness all
[1:34:54] right
[1:34:55] would see a great light
[1:34:58] and once the water is found and Jesus
[1:35:01] said come unto me all you that are weary
[1:35:03] and heavy laden I will give you rest
[1:35:04] come and drink of the Water of Life yeah
[1:35:08] once the water is found the deer is
[1:35:11] released yes to fulfill its purpose and
[1:35:14] begin to produce goodly words the right
[1:35:18] kind of words that could bring about I
[1:35:21] don't want to scare you but could bring
[1:35:22] about a resurrection
[1:35:26] all Hallelujah
[1:35:28] the right words at the right time that
[1:35:32] we could be like caty Wright when she
[1:35:35] spoke he knew that she would say she
[1:35:37] would ask for the right thing all that
[1:35:39] he could trust us that much he would
[1:35:42] know we wouldn't ask for money but our
[1:35:44] words would be goodly words right we
[1:35:46] wouldn't even ask for physical healing
[1:35:48] although that's part of the Covenant but
[1:35:50] what did she ask for she said the
[1:35:52] salvation of my children what's the most
[1:35:54] important thing the salvation of our
[1:35:56] children what what are we going to
[1:35:58] someday that bride's got to get to a
[1:35:59] place of maturity until we ask for the
[1:36:02] right things I believe we're right there
[1:36:04] I believe this message has brought us
[1:36:06] into that place yes into that fullness
[1:36:09] of the word we can begin to rise up and
[1:36:11] say lord it's time for me to speak
[1:36:14] hallelujah it's time for me to be who I
[1:36:17] am musicians go ahead and come it's time
[1:36:19] for me to be like the deer that's found
[1:36:21] the water oh yes
[1:36:23] been released from the snare of the
[1:36:25] hunter oh yeah producing beautiful fonts
[1:36:29] beautiful words of life never let your
[1:36:32] testimony be negative
[1:36:34] could we do that today could we actually
[1:36:36] do that he said brother Ben you don't
[1:36:38] know what I've been through I don't but
[1:36:40] I know what God will do for you
[1:36:44] and I don't I wasn't tempted in every
[1:36:46] point to know what you're going through
[1:36:48] I didn't go through all of that but he
[1:36:50] did
[1:36:52] everything
[1:36:54] that you've been through he was he was
[1:36:57] touched by that
[1:37:00] in his Humanity he he he lived that he
[1:37:04] come and lived that he was a young
[1:37:06] person he was a he was middleaged he was
[1:37:08] he was sick he was weary
[1:37:12] he hurt he had pain everything he went

[1:38:06] come on church we got to reach a place
[1:38:07] of maturity I'm not here just to hear
[1:38:10] music I'm not here just to hear
[1:38:11] preaching or to see how long the service
[1:38:13] goes I'm here to receive from God I'm
[1:38:16] here to get a blessing I come here to

[1:38:24] Pastor's going to have something to say

[1:38:28] to move in the right direction I believe
[1:38:30] things are going to be better
[1:38:33] I believe that the spirit of God is
[1:38:35] going to meet us tonight and people are
[1:38:37] going to be delivered and people are
[1:38:38] going to be healed if we'd begin to talk
[1:38:40] like that what kind of a words would
[1:38:42] begin to come from our lips what kind of
[1:38:44] manifestation
[1:38:45] would come from our heart if we speak
[1:38:48] nothing but negativity nothing but
[1:38:50] negativity listen to me church you can
[1:38:52] talk yourself right out of the church
[1:38:55] talk yourself right out of the message

[1:39:25] maybe maybe that's why
[1:39:29] marriage is on the Rocks
[1:39:31] job's not going too well
[1:39:35] maybe it's because the way you're
[1:39:36] talking about it

[1:39:41] helped me today
[1:39:44] not to be negative towards the message
