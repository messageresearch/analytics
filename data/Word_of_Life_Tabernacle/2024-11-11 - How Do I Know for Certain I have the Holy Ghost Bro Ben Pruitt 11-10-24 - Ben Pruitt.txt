Ghost and have been changed new creatures in Christ I pray you granted tonight thank you for all that you've done in Jesus name amen thank you Lord Jesus amen if we could stand together just briefly 1 Corinthians chap 12 and verse 13 try not to hold you all long tonight but uh we just want to get into the word of God 1 Corinthians chapter 12 and we'll read from verse 13 just a moment to get there you young people got your Bibles tonight and going to need the Bible and need to listen verse 13 for by one Spirit we are we all baptized into one body whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether we be Bond or free and have been ma all made to drink into one Spirit pray the Lord would add his Blessing to the word you may be seated tonight I was asked a question here a while back about the Holy SP Spirit it was actually not a young person that asked me this question but I'll uh give you a little bit of the question but not all of it because I don't want to embarrass the person but I think it would be good for all of us to understand how do we know for certain that we have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and I was talking to someone earlier about what I was going to speak on and Levi told me he said you know one preacher he had heard just said well you just know you just know and actually that's not a bad not a bad uh not a bad way of putting it but we're going to get a little bit more depth tonight and you do just know but it's the devil's job to come and try to take that knowledge away from you it's his job to try to attack you in that and so uh we uh we we need to understand uh that the baptism of the Holy Ghost is something we can have we need to understand that it's something that we need that we need you young people you you you understand that you you've got to have it to get out of here we're not going to leave here without the bap AP ISM of the Holy Ghost without the true baptism of the Holy Ghost you've got to be sealed or you won't go in a Rapture right and so we we don't want to be here for the tribulation period we want to go home and so we want to be sealed we that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost that takes us to that now the question that I had uh they said brother Ben I've been reading on the Holy Ghost for some time now and I have a lot of questions I've heard people say they have the Holy Ghost but it doesn't show in people's nature and sometime I'd like to hear how you receive God's spirit and says different Supernatural things things has happened that I can't explain but I knew it was God and they said I don't want to miss the Rapture I want to know that I know that I know and I have his spirit that ought to be all of us tonight and so that was the question and I thought it would be especially good if we addressed it uh for the Youth and I'll say about myself uh maybe maybe my own testimony will help some of you I was raised in church and I had a heart for the Lord I was in church I don't remember we never didn't go to church we always went to church but I heard a lot of different teachings and things over the years I was unsure of whether I had the Holy Ghost and so I come up I was baptized at the age of seven I gave my heart to the Lord I preached uh my first sermon when I was 12 years old and uh and you know I don't know why somebody let me preach at that age but they did and so I started preaching young some of you all remember the forest when I started preaching around here I was about 16 17 years old and and and so I but I wasn't sure until just before that actually when I was still living at home I wasn't sure of my salvation even I wasn't sure I was even going to heaven and I was preaching the gospel I wasn't sure that I had the baptism the Holy Ghost I knew I needed it but I wasn't sure and I had a lot of conviction in my life but yet I went through things that a young person goes through and had the same Temptations and things that all of you go through and and so I locked myself in a room one day in our basement in the house that my dad built and I'll never forget this I I I locked myself in that room and I said Lord I I heard in the message where brother brandom said that uh he said uh buddy Robinson got in the cornfield and he said if you don't give me the Holy Ghost you're going to find a bag of bones and and so I said Lord I need the baptism of the Holy Ghost I need to be sure and and so I believe God did something for me that night that he gave me the Holy Ghost and and it did and and I locked myself in the room I said I'm not going to I'm going to leave here till I got it and that's where I put my steak down and that's where I've held on to ever since I believe I'm going to heaven I believe I'm going to make it I'm going to be in the Rapture so I know we've have to have that experience I've had many other experiences I've spoke with tongues I've seen Miracles done I've baptized people and led them to the Lord I've had spiritual dreams at times and and understood things about people and but that's I'm not saying that to glorify myself all of you many of you have done those same things but those things is not how we know that we have the Holy Ghost right that's not how we know and I want to go through some of the things that how why we don't know or how we what what is not the evidence of the Holy Ghost before we get to what it is and so the F in the first place if you've been baptized that's good but baptism water baptism is not the new birth right so you need to be baptized aped young people if you haven't been baptized you need to be baptized sometimes I don't think we stress that enough Peter said repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost so if you have been baptized you should believe that the Holy Ghost is coming right some of you Elders can say Amen to that you you can believe the Holy Ghost is coming but yet you it is not the gift of the Holy Ghost you will receive the gift of the Holy Ghost ghost and that's because of obedience baptism is about obedience Peter says baptism do also now save us he said not the putting away of the filth of the flesh but the answer of a good conscience toward God by the resurrection of Jesus Christ Peter could you give me just a little more monitors I've I've lost my monitors now brother brand says I believe you're saved by accepting Jesus Christ and water baptism is an outward expression to show that something inwardly has happened because the water has no virtue it's just a symbol so you could be baptized and not have the baptism of the Holy Ghost you can believe and not have the baptism of the Holy Ghost yet believing is essential all right we must believe if you don't believe you can't even get to square one you've got to believe without faith no man can please God and yet Believing by itself isn't proof of the Holy Ghost Jesus said this he said very verely I say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life shall not come into condemnation but has passed from Death un life brother Ram explains that and says that hearing is understanding comprehending so it's not just hearing but it's hearing with spiritual ears and we know that they all heard with these ears but they did not all obey and so we find even the Devil he's a Believer how many know that the devil the Bible says the devil th believest there's one God that doest well the Devils also believe and tremble that's a lot more than some of us right they really believe it right but and they tremble at what what's coming they know what's in their future oh if we can only get as much a revelation of what's in our future as the devil's got of what's in his future he knows his time is short and that's why he comes after you like he does but yet we know that that not only is his time short but our time is short we're going home if we get a revelation of that but the devil believes and trembles so brother BR says to believe it is not enough to walk around where it's at isn't enough that's to make yourself worse right because he he explained that he said it's like a log if you've ever been walking in the forest for the ship and you you step on a an Old Log and it's been in the water and you step on it looks good but when you step on it just explodes right what what is that it's it's been it's had access to water but not life right its roots aren't in the ground and so it's sitting in the water and it actually gets worse because it's in the water what if it was the dry stick up on the ground so being in church won't save you and just believing is not enough actually if you believe you don't believe if you don't receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost eventually you find that your belief is not enough it won't hold you now believing really believing ought to lead us to the baptism of the ho Holy Ghost repenting is not enough and yet you must repent right the Zeal of the hour is to repent but repentance isn't a seal of the Holy Ghost your tears are not a seal of the Holy Ghost you say well I went to The Altar and I cried that don't mean that that's an Evidence of the Holy Ghost but we need that we need to promote that we need to someone said here not long go we need to make the altar great again we need to make it wean we need to make it normal for people to cry an altar to come to an altar to to seek God in that way it should not be abnormal for us to do that in our churches brother the for us that'll be something that's common to us to see good people come and ask for prayer but that's alone is not enough that's not evidence because you came is not evidence that you have the Holy Ghost we know that because as I said this morning Esau was rejected he found no place of repentance we sought it carefully with tears but God doesn't seal your tears he seals your faith are you with me now and we're for that we want we believe in Repentance but that's not evidence the Holy Spirit gifts of the Spirit are not evidence of the Holy Spirit the Pentecostals taught that tongu was evidence so you'll find brother brandom dealing with that over and over and over and over again because that was their major his major disagreement especially in the early years was on that that's what they really had against him is he didn't believe in uh tongues as the evidence of the Holy Spirit and you say well how could they come up with that well in the Bible if you look in the book of Acts most of the time when people received the Holy Ghost they spoke in tongues so the Pentecostals looked at that and said okay said that's the evidence of the Holy Ghost right but there's nothing in the scripture that says that right but and and and in fact Paul says have all the gifts of healing he said do all speak with tongues no obviously no all interpret but these gifts are in the body gifts can be there whether you're saved or not saved right gifts can fall in the body in a supernatural way and someone could speak in tongues and not even be right right absolutely not be right so tongues is no evidence of the Holy Ghost it's one of the gifts of the Holy Ghost and the devil can impersonate everything he's got he said Divine Healing and everything else he can impersonate that and we know even healing We Believe healing is from God just because the man who laid hands on you and you were healed uh you were healed when he did that doesn't mean the man is even right it's by faith so and I'm going to address something here I we see a lot of folks some young people you know you go to camp or someplace like that and you'll see a lot of folks slaying in the spirit and I know we got several young people aren't here today but they're watching or or we'll watch it you'll see somebody's slay in the spirit and you look at that and you go through the par line maybe nothing happens you think well I I didn't get what they got well being slain in the spirit is's no evidence that you got anything but it is a blessing right it's real it's a blessing and I don't want you to ever mock somebody or make fun of somebody right CU they got slain in the spirit they danced in the spirit because those things are real he said how do you know well Prophet told us said it was he said it was a blessing of God but not proof of anything he he was asked the question brother brandom as I went through the prayer line a short time ago Anointed Hands were laid on me and and prayer was made for my unsaved husband I was slain by the power of the Lord is this a definite sign that he'll be saved so I come up with a request and I was slain in the spirit is that a sign he'll be saved and brother Brandon was very cautious in his response he said sister I wouldn't think that it was a definite sign that he was to be saved though I believe he will be saved certainly he said now could you say that th said the Lord be careful about that cuz see it might be the Holy Spirit blessing you because you've taken a place of Christ in other words she went up there and and become a a intermediary she stood up there in the place of her husband she took the place of Christ to him and or for him he talks about tongues and and all of that he said now you see God knows where those things are and he has a way of doing it he has his own way of doing it and so he said we must just submit ourselves to what he does listen to me young people when you come through a prayer line when you're prayed for up here when you come to the altar don't be looking for any certain thing to happen but just accept whatever God does for you right so Melody God may do something different for Melody than he does for Millie but just accept what he does are you with me now just accept that he he may not act all the time in Peter like he does in trip or or in one like he does the other we know we got folks here some of you folks are wonderful Christian people and you've hardly ever moved a muscle in church and you're wonderful Christian people but you sit there and just listen to the word and then we got other people that dance and run and shout and are emot I'm an emotional person but that don't mean that's not proof of anything it's just proof God's blessing us right God's blessing us but it's not proof that that we're right there's got to be something more than that because those momentary Sensations will fail you they'll leave but there's got to be something you can put a uh put a steak down and a can be a rock in your life that no matter what the devil does to you you can say I'm a Christian I believe I'm going to make it because we don't want a bunch of people that are scared all the time afraid keep having to come back get resaved all the time we've had enough of that we want people that are solid go ask somebody go ask one of these Elders how they made it all these years it wasn't because they just kept coming and getting resaved it was because there was something on the inside that attracted them to the word of God and held them to the message of the hour huh so we believe they saw something real and they believed it so brother Brandon says if you don't watch now let me go back to that other one he said we must just submit ourselves to what he does and then he said the hard thing to do when you get there is hold yourself from that one little knife edge of fanaticism to a truth right so that that's the thing you got to be careful and I don't want to ever discourage you because we need the move of the Holy Spirit we need that but just make sure that you don't put your faith in the effect but put your faith in the person Jesus Christ amen now I'm not amening myself I'm trying to amen the word now brother BR say if you don't watch the devil will throw you right over into a bunch of fanaticism and you lose all your experience and everything else when you do that so you lose confidence what you do have right if you make try to make too much out of the experience itself he said but if you can just hold the solid truth watch the Bible stay with it stay Meek and humble God will just keep taking you on towards Calvary just on down the road like that if you'll just stay with that he said that's something like yours was Sister he's still answering this question he said God was just giving you a blessing he said it might have been might be a definite witness that you're going to but I wouldn't rely just on that and say the Lord told me cuz I I said that experience because it might encourage you to continue to believe on he said whatever it was that God did there brought the spirit upon you like that it was for some purpose it might have been something else but if it was for you husband he'll sure come right into the kingdom of God right cuz God always brings it to pass what do we hold on to then hold on to the word what do we hold on to for our kids not the way they're acting currently hold on to the word what does the word have to say are you with me now I I appreciate you Elders in the back backing me I I uh I I know these young people appreciate it and all of us we need to I think we need to hear these things fundamental truth of the message I know it's not flashy but it's just something we need to hear you know you don't know you have it by because you can preach or because you can teach right because you have an understanding of the message the Bible says the gifts and callings of God are without repentance and Matthew 7:22 Jesus said many will say to me in that day Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils in thy name done many wonderful works and then when I profess unto them I never knew you depart from me you that work iniquity brother Bron said I realized and you realize too ministers he said that a man can take a Divine gift and send his soul to hell with it right so we need to be careful we don't rely just on gifts this one I think is a little bit harder for message people but living a good life is not the evidence of the baptism of the Holy Ghost right it's not if that was true then every Muslim that I met in Egypt has the Holy Ghost cuz they they they outlive us many of them do many of them live good lives that's not the evidence of the Holy Ghost it's an evidence that God is working in your life when your life begins to resemble the word but it's not the evidence of the Holy Ghost because someone could just naturally be a person who was prone or at least so it look like that was prone to doing things in a right way they still need saved they still need the power of the Holy Ghost just because they don't make mistakes all the time doesn't mean that they're filled with the Holy Ghost and sometimes that person it can be a very a deceiving thing see it's absolutely necessary to have Holiness in your life Paul said follow peace with all men and Holiness without which no man shall see the Lord that's an absolute necessity but Holiness itself is not a proof I was I grew up around Holiness people many people who would reject the word re reject the Oneness of the godhead reject the the truth that God sent a prophet reject all these things that we believe but they were they lived well they were wonderful people and I appreciate the fact that they lived well but that wasn't proof of the Holy Ghost because they turned down the word so it's absolutely necessary but it isn't all of it see you you can't work your way into God's favor I want you to understand that tonight you can work and make yourself look good and everybody will everybody be happy with you here in the church but you can't work your way into God 's favor you girls understand that you can't be good enough to make it into heaven you got to have the blood got to have a sacrifice made for you you got to identify with that sacrifice if you could work your way in Kane would make it brother Brandon said he was sincere built an altar knelt down and worshiped offered a sacrifice and prayed to God and if that's all God requires for you to belong to church and have an altar and pay your tithes and go to church and live a good life if that's all he requires he was unjust to condemn Cain because he did the same thing religion means a covering you can't be covered by your own good works there's only one thing that God will accept and that's the blood of Jesus Christ that's the only covering oh I'm so grateful for the blood you won't be you can't you don't know you're filled with the Holy Ghost by listening to tapes or by hearing your pastor or because your pastor says you've got it because your pastor can't give it to you you also can't take it away so you you you don't know that you have the Holy Ghost because your pastor thinks you do now come on Church you know that's the truth your favorite preacher or you listen to them all the time so well I just stream all the services all over the land and I listen to all of them that don't mean you're going to heaven right I've heard every tape all 1147 however many there are now I've heard every tape listen that that don't mean you're going to heaven cuz guess who else has hurt all of them the devil right we need to hear the voice of a prophet how many of how many believe that our kids need to hear it needs to be in our homes but the tapes themselves are not the Holy Ghost that's not the token if they were Millions would be going in the Rapture cuz there's Millions all over the world that hear tapes that's not that's not the Rapture but what is on the tapes when that becomes flesh and it begins to live that's what that's what we want but they said that's he said you say I believe I believe the message that's all right but that's that's good but you must have the token he said' do you hear random Tabernacle can I say can I change that that do you hear Word of Life Tabernacle you must have the token displayed without it all your believing is in vain you live a good life you listen to what the word says you go to church you try to live right that's fine but that's not it when I see the blood that's the token he said and the token here is not he said what he had to see the actual chemistry that was in the Old Testament because the life had gone he had gone from it he was an animal but here it's his own life that was in the blood and the chemistry was only a signal or a sign of sanctification but the life itself is the token for without the circumcision without the token you're not even in the Covenant he said the whole thing works together if you say you're circumcised to the word and it only then you'll believe the word if you believe the word then the token has got to come so in other words if you have really repented if you really believe the token will come that alone's not the token but the token will come repent be baptized you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost we know that love is not the token I'm almost through these and we'll go to what it is we know that love is not the token because and and yet the Bible says it's such a strong evidence of Christ working I'll say this uh if you don't have any love I'd check up if you don't love your brother whom you have seen how can you love God whom you have not seen if you don't love people if you don't love your neighbor if you don't love the people in the church are you with me now if you don't love God's people you probably don't love God but but having love is not necessarily an Evidence Bible says we know we passed from death into life because we love the Breen that's pretty strong but he that loveth not his brother abideth in death so it's a essential absolutely essential it's one of the ways that we know we passed from death into life just like when you start become a Christian you start paying ties you start following the word one of those one one thing that the word says is love your neighbor love your brother right but that's not the only thing by itself it isn't proof brother Brandon was having a conversation with Lee Vale about the evidence of the Holy Ghost and he said he knew it wasn't tongues and brother brand said I said the most perfect evidence I can think of is love so we got talking on that and then I thought that sounded pretty good so I just held that if a man has got love he said but one day the Lord in a vision straightened me out I'm glad we had a prophet who was honest he said that the evidence of the spirit was those who could receive the word neither love nor speaking in tongues but it's receiving the word so that brings us to this how do I know for certain that I have the Holy Ghost first of all the the baptism of the Holy Ghost is a definite experience right it's not just an accumulation of knowledge it's not a n a certain number of services visited right where you pass a certain thing it's not living so good in such a way that eventually you pass the inspection right that's not what the Holy Ghost is it's a definite experience in every case every account of the New Testament where people receive the Holy Ghost it was a definite singular experience brother brand said now the baptism with the Holy Spirit is a definite experience that a person must receive it's an experience so but the evidence of the experience is not the experience now does that make sense so the so you have a definite experience but you could have two people both come to the altar seeking the Holy Ghost both of them come both of them get blessed both of them cry both of them repent both of them get up and shout both of them walk way one have the Holy Ghost and one don't right and and why would that be why could that be well one number one in this age age that we're living in now the Holy Ghost will only Quicken the seed that's already inside of there there's got to be a seed there's got to be predestination election there right it's got to be something that God does for you you can't do it for yourself so the two might come but then you don't know what obedience has taken place in the person's life them to this we know obedience entitles Us full obedience to the Lord entitles us to the Token you don't know what type of obedience or whether that person has obeyed or whether it just looks like they've obeyed but they need to have obeyed God to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost but the experience itself is not the evidence but it's what follows the experience it it is in tongues as we've already said even though many speak with tongues the brand said that's no evidence of the Holy Ghost you can't rely upon that he said you can't rely upon the the fruit of the spirit because of first fruit of the spirit is love he said there's only one evidence of the holy spirit that I know of now listen to me that's a genuine faith in the promised word of the hour now brother Brandon puts this in several different ways but I want to take it scripturally and then we'll we'll finish and I I'll try to get you out of here just as soon as I can but it's an important thing now look that's the evidence of the Holy Ghost when God reveals to you and you see it thus sayith the Lord and accept it not what you are what you was or nothing about it it's what God has done for you now he said that's the evidence so we know you say well that's just you know brother brandom said that did you know that the evidence of the Holy Ghost is clearly defined in scripture it's very clear in the scripture brother Bram tells us that he said he give us Jesus give us the evidence of the Holy Ghost John 14 John 14:26 but the comfort which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name what is he going to do right here's how you know that he's there he will teach you all things someone say all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you John 15:26 the next chapter but when the comforter has come whom I will send unto you from the father even the spirit of Truth which proceedeth from the father he shall testify of me what is he the spirit of Truth teaching you all things things John 16:13 how be it when he the spirit of Truth has come he will guide you he will guide you into all Truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come so when you have the Holy Ghost you have an inside teacher that's bringing you from a baby to maturity right right right does that make sense yeah so the fact that you're coming from a baby to maturity and so that's why we judge nothing before the time right we we don't want to and sometimes the devil see it's his job to make you think well I don't have it I don't have it I here I made a mistake I slipped up I was influenced to do some minor thing no we don't look at it like that see we're not born adults we're born babies right and and even with the Holy Ghost we we don't just get the Holy Ghost then it's all good right now now we're certain of our destination but there's a teacher on the inside right you got a little teacher in your heart now think about that kids a teacher in your heart that's teaching you the word and every time you go to do something that's not right before you had the Holy Ghost didn't bother you right or maybe it bothered you because you knew it was wrong but you just you just kept doing it you just kept going back to it but now there's a teacher on the inside right what's he doing he's bringing you back to the word he's reminding you of the word word and that's why a person that just lives in slop and sin and filth how could they have the Holy Ghost they're denying the word in their life are you with me now a person that that that that just continues and and in in all of those things how could they have the baptism the H ghost think it's time to check up right we need to understand the Holy Ghost does something it's a it's a it's a tutor that's got control a control tower on the inside that actually controls our actions and our thinking and everything about it so when you have the Holy Ghost the inside teacher will be there it doesn't mean you'll never make a mistake but you're growing from a baby to maturity one day that same teacher is going to take you home oh that's what we need now the Holy Spirit when it comes it's a witness unto you this word is right the word for today not the word for Luther the word not for Moses he said we witness it's the truth but it's another day so that Holy Spirit teaches you that the word is right the holy spirit in you will not disagree with the word right it will people say well I was led of the Holy Ghost to do a certain thing not if it's not in the word right because the holy spirit will not disagree with the word he will not disagree with the scriptures he will not disagree you say well I feel led to go out and divorce my husband and marry another one divorce my wife the Holy Spirit didn't lead you to do that right because he will not lead against the word right and when you see people sons of God are led by the spirit of God when you see young people led by the word and begin to order their lives by the word you begin to see there's something there that experience did something in their life how do you know for certain because he's brought you to where you are you you wouldn't be there without it someone said if you ever seen a turtle on a fence post you know it didn't get there by itself right if you ever seen a person in maturity of the word he didn't get there by himself are you with me now you said well I wish I could be like Dad I wish I could be like Mom I wish I could be like brother Danny I wish I could be like brother the forest or somebody that's been around for a long time he didn't get there by himself the Holy Ghost had to be in his life and the Holy Ghost is the inside teacher so how do you know well you that inside teacher is going to say Amen to every word right he's not going to deny his own word yeah brother brand says 1 Corinthians 13 says this when that was just perfect has come now he was asked a question about the same thing about the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he goes through how tongues do not it and then he says when that which is perfect is come that which is in part should be done away with he sets all these little things are jumping up and down like a kid trying to talk in tongues all these other things he said when that which is perfect we do have today by God's help the perfect interpretation of the word with Divine Vindication then that which is in part is done away with when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child when I become a man I put away child things if you want to know about the baptism of the Holy Ghost go listen to what is the Holy Ghost and what was the Holy Ghost given for and then go to uh go to questions and answers number two and number three in 1964 also to the Token those sermons will really solidify because brother Bram has asked and he answers the question several times in just a little bit different way during those questions and answers the Bible tells us I want to dwell on this for just a minute uh because you don't want to always be what you are today Jared you don't always want to be I know you're tall and handsome and but you don't always want to be what you are today right you want to be more than what you are sir you want to be a full-grown adult right and that's true spiritually listen church I've been preaching for nearly 30 years and I want to I want to be more than what I am today sir I want to be more I think all of us could say Amen to that I I want to be more I want to be what God's called me to be I I want to grow in the grace and the maturity of God and the Holy Ghost will lead me to that it takes the Holy Ghost to do that we don't want to always be a baby and always have to keep making the same mistakes over and over again at some point the young and's got to grow up as one of my friends put it at some point we got to reach a place of maturity right and begin to begin to grab a hold of the word for ourselves and say I don't have to have my pastor taught me into being saved every week I I don't have to have a deacon keep an eye on me and make sure that I'm saved every week but I don't have to have my parents always over my shoulder making sure I'm still saved but I know there's an inside teacher inside of me reach a place to mature I don't want to go out on God I love him too much to fail him now I don't want to do those things anymore I've reached that place in my life inside teacher that which is in part has been done away with and that which is perfect which is the full word of God has come the Bible says as many as receed him to them gave he power to become the sons of God that's what the Holy Ghost is even to those that believe on his name Ephesians 4:15 but speaking the truth and love may grow up into him in all things he's talking about the five-fold ministry here and what our job is and how we should edify the church so that we can the church can grow the church can grow what does that that's the job of the holy spirit in your life so that you grow you want to know if you have the Holy Ghost see if there's growth in your life huh you still got the same old temper that you've had all your life and you just make an excuse for it come on Church you still got the same old problem you all your life you dealt with the same old things I realize that you still deal with a prickly nature I realize that but at some point it shouldn't control you no more right is there growth in your life if there's growth you can see there holy you may not be perfect you may not be doing everything just the way maybe everybody wants you to or you even expect yourself to but there's something on the inside that's leading you from where you are to a better place there's something in you calling you to the house of God you may not have been as faithful to attend church as you should have been but something inside of you is calling you to that right what is that the inside teacher the Holy Ghost heyen so John he said now so what is the evidence person's really filled with the Holy Ghost brother brandom answers that question that's a question he's asked and he he says John 14:26 right when the Holy Ghost has come he will show you things to come he'll here it is he'll perfect it he'll perfect it right when the Holy Ghost is come he will perfect Oh my he will bring you into maturity maturity of the age he won't leave you that's why he said you don't have the Holy Ghost if you won't receive the word of the hour right because you you not you're not will to come into maturity if you have the Holy Ghost you you'll accept the word many times we're trying to reform people we're trying to psychologize people if that's a word we're trying to make them better in some way oh if they were just better if I could just had more counseling or whatever and really what they need is the Holy Ghost so he can begin to teach them from the inside right and if everybody had the Holy Ghost I've often felt sorry for denominational pastors for the force because of all always thought boy what would you do if all your congregation was not filled with the Holy Ghost that's tough right I believe that a lot of us are and I'm thankful for that why because you got an inside teacher and he's echoing what's coming across the pulpit right if I'm preaching the truth the inside teacher says Amen to that if you hear a tape brother br's preaching the inside teacher says Amen to that amen so he said he'll perfect it manads won't do it he is the word when he the Holy Ghost has come he will identify himself in you with the scripture and that is the true sign that the holy spirit is in you because it is the word listen John 6:45 brother Brandon references this when we talk about the evidence of the Holy Ghost he say it is written in the prophets they shall be all taught of God every man therefore that hath heard and hath learned of the father cometh unto me what is the Holy Ghost Inside teacher the Holy Ghost the inside teacher everyone that has learned of the father cometh unto me in Isaiah 54:13 where that where he quotes that scripture from it says all thy children brother Brown Put special emphasis on that he said not just anybody but the children right the the predestined of God all thy children shall be taught of the Lord and great shall be the Peace of thy children oh when you have the inside teacher there's peace in your life because there's something that that brings you no matter what comes it holds you it's an absolute it's something that's there that keeps you in the hour of Temptation it don't mean you'll never make a mistake because you realize your body and your spirit are never saved do you know that yeah we talk about the flesh we mean the body the flesh realm the outside literal flesh realm and the spirit realm but the soul is saved right you said well my body's saved I don't know what you're talking about well you'll never get sick then right well my spirit saved well you'll never have a bad attitude then right we all have bad attitudes don't we you kids your your parents you believe they got the Holy Ghost your parents got the Holy Ghost many of them now look you well I don't know about my parents but we'll we'll leave that huh your parents have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and they have bad attitudes sometimes don't they my daughter's nodding she's the only one what is that that's the outside man that's the flesh you got to keep under your body bring it into subjection but there's something that controls that I don't beat I don't beat my kids and abuse them and I don't I don't go around I don't go around running around doing things that I shouldn't do why there's something on the inside inside teacher do I make mistakes absolutely but there's something that controls that don't let me live that way makes me apologize when I do have a bad attitude I apologize a lot are you with me look at your life are you coming from from an infant to to maturity or you still just laying there as a baby it's evidence of the Holy Ghost that the inside teacher he's perfecting it he's growing it he's you're saying Amen to the word and as you do as you receive the word you become the word amen now look what what do you say in revelation 22 he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith to the churches he that can be taught he that has a spiritual ear now listen brother B said now you can begin to see why tongues is not the evidence of being baptized with the Holy Ghost it doesn't say in any age he that hath a tongue let him say what the spirit is saying he said that puts tongues interpretation thereof in Prophecy Etc aside as an Evidence the evidence is hearing what the spirit says the spirit is talking yes the spirit is teaching as the exactly what Jesus said he would do when he came John 14:26 he will teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you again I don't have time to read all of this you can go and read some of when you get home but he said he told us the evidence or what would happen after being baptized with the Holy Ghost was that we would have the teacher come and teach all truth but that teacher was an inside teacher not an out wouldn't it been great when you were in school to have an inside teacher that had been pretty good wouldn't it huh there this teacher out here teaching you and you this one in here says here I'll tell you how to do calculus you know got that one wouldn't that have been great that's what you have when you have the Holy Ghost right the outside teacher can say all these things that we say the inside teacher is what teaches you those things are true yeah that's that's right that's right feed on it believe it become it oh my oh my people that are always offended at the message is there is the inside teacher there are you with me now if you're always just brother Brown's always saying things that offend you see the word come to the prophet and the inside teacher agrees with the word that was free now look that teacher was an inside teacher not an outside teacher if the spirit wasn't inside you wouldn't hear the truth and receive it by Revelation if you heard it every moment of the today that's why I say it's tapes are not the evidence of the Holy Ghost it can't be because he said if you heard it every moment of the day if you didn't have an inside teacher you wouldn't receive it that was the sign of the indwelling spirit in the days of Paul those who were filled with the Holy Ghost heard the word received it and lived by it those who did not have the spirit heard it only as carnal men put a wrong interpretation on it and went into sin in every age in every age someone say every age is the age of the Holy Ghost for the True Believer so young young people you can say well it wasn't for an age it was past you say well they used to receive the baptism of Holy Ghost no every age is an age of the Holy Ghost for the True Believer he said I say in every age the evidence was the same those who had the spirit the teacher heard the word and that spirit in them took the word and taught it revealed it to them and they were of the group that heard the messenger and his message and took it and lived it there's the evidence of the Holy Ghost now look I'm closing in just a moment there was a man brother R talked about you remember the story he was he come across a piece of paper one time at a car lot that he owned and said where will you spend eternity that's a simple thing but something just clicked in his heart he said I need to know I want to know that I'm going to make it I don't know I think every one of us have that desire I still Lord I I cry all the time pray God give me a refilling of the Holy Ghost I don't think it's wrong to pray for that God I know what you've done for me I'm not doubting what you've done for me but today I need it again I need I need your power we feel that conviction well this man had never felt that before but now he felt it he it was just it was just a piece of paper where will you spend eternity and so he goes and goes to the Baptist church and they told him oh if you get baptized and come to the altar he said you'll you'll be saved and he did that and it just something was missing he just didn't know so he went to the Methodist church and they told him said if you'll if you'll get down at the altar and get really Sanctified give up everything of the world and then come up with the witness of the spirit and Shout said you'll know you have it so he did that and he said he still didn't just something was wrong he just didn't feel like he had it and so he he went to the Pentecostals the Full Gospel people and and or the Pentecostal people and they said well if you we know what's wrong you haven't spoken tongues yet that's the answer for everything in Pentecost right speaking in tongues and not to Bel that but it was I I've been in those churches and around those groups it just that's just answer to everything it's why part of the reason I was so confused as a as a child we were around a whole lot of those kind of people and so you you got trouble at work speaking tongues you know you got trouble at home speak in tongues you you don't have the baptism of the Holy Spirit speak in tongues so he spoke in tongues and he still didn't like he had it so we come to the Full Gospel people and they said well we'll tell you what to do so you go to brother brandom he's a prophet he'll be able to discern your life and tell you what all happened in your life why you can't receive it because evidently there's something wrong so he come to brother brandom and he said said what brother brandom I I've done all these things what am I supposed to do how how am I supposed to know that I've got it and brother brand told him he said do you he said do you remember he even told Brother brand he said I've sold all the cars and giving the money to preachers well where are people like that I wonder sometime but brother Brandon said you didn't have to do that that's what he said you didn't have to do that he said he said you remember when you picked up that piece of paper said where will you spend eternity he said I want to know that I've got it he said remember when you picked it up where will you spend eternity he said right where you made your turn Church see if I'm going down the road how do I know that I've got the Holy Ghost because I was headed down the wrong road and I come to I come to a definite experience in my life and after that experience brother the trip I started going a different direction I've made my mistakes I've had my pitfalls I've i' I've struggled at times but I've kept going down that road something inside of me was crying out teaching me all the time something was leading me something was was guiding me and many times I was stubborn I didn't do the right things but God still led me he led me to this place brother the BR said right where you made your turn I want you to have confidence today young people where did you get it right where you made your turn if you feel that tug of God that pull of God follow that follow that presence that you feel follow until you become a new Creature if any man be in Christ he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things have become new follow until your life proves what you are he said be not conformed to this world but be trans form by the renewing of your mind you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God follow it until then oh church I preach just as hard as I can today I know a lot of people have been gone and different things are going on and things but I just believe that there's some reason why he just been sitting on my shoulder all day just telling me tell me preach and I've been trying to preach it's the best that I can but it's got to be received by faith there's got to be something in your heart that makes you want to feed on the word makes you not because your parents do it but makes you you young people you've got an opportunity to listen to the message do you do it do you feed on it we got we got it on our phones on apps you know you can't wait till you get a phone that'd be it be a good time if you do have one I'm I'm not saying you should but if you do get your kids the phone be a good time to put the message on it amen make sure that they're in their Bible number one they ought to have a Bible right that they can read for themselves you young people you got a responsibility to read your Bible don't let me do I can't do that for you he said well my parents don't have family prayer time well then you do it yourself I don't wait on them to do it you do it get up in the morning read your Bible and pray see what a difference it makes in your life what is that inside teacher will come in he'll change your life he's leading us a quote I read this morning just struck me it just hit me as the musicians come brother Brandon said that we've seen The Chariot of fire think about it for a minute church as Elijah was waiting and The Chariot of fire when he saw Elisha saw it he knew he was going to get a double portion brother Brown said we've seen The Chariot of fire what was it the pillar of fire it it was evidence already even had his picture taken with the prophet we have seen the Chariot of fire he said in one of these days he said he's just going to untie the horses from the bushes and take us home what's going to take us home the Holy Ghost what is the pillar of fire the logos the word which is what we learned this morning which is the Holy Ghost right the Holy Ghost what Broods over the church what gives us he said what what do you feel when you feel his presence so real and you know you feel it there's something there and you you just feel that that anointing that warmth that comes over you what is that brother Peter it's the Holy Ghost it's the pillar of fire just receive it accept it walk into it he'll lead you home once he comes inside once that fire comes inside he'll leads you all the way home you won't have to worry no more about it don't let the devil beat you up if you received to add a definite experience with God you continue in that if you've not I invite you to do that tonight would you bow your heads with me if you don't have the Holy Ghost I'd be seeking it with all of my heart cuz you can't make it in a Rapture without it I don't want to leave one of our children behind I I don't want to see you have to go out in the world and experience the world in the way that the world does things I don't want to see that I I want to see you changed I want to see you make that turn while you're young go ahead go ahead and make that turn go ahead and do it give in to the to the leading of the Holy Spirit surrender to him make that turn what's not a big youth me there's not a bunch of people here tonight but why don't you just make that turn you can do it I was by myself in a room many of you have testimonies like that make that turn his presence is here his word is here make that turn follow him all the way home if you've made that turn don't you let anything get in your way don't you let anything get in your way hear me Church don't let anything get in your way don't let a job get in your way don't let money get in your way don't let a wife or a husband get in your way you follow God will let anything get in your way follow the pillar of fire The Chariot of fire till you follow him home oh God Heavenly Father Lord I've I I preach all I know how to preach Lord and I pray that was cleared up in some way as the devil just tries to confuse us so many times I pray you'd make it clear to the people my feeble efforts Lord but you are able to strengthen the words that I preached if they're your words Lord they'll find good soil or and they will not return void we thank you for that tonight Lord we all want to be changed we we don't want to look at it as if we've already attained but to be like the Apostle Paul who said I press toward the mark of the high calling in Christ let that inside teacher continue to teach and to to lead to make us different than what we were to leave this service as we leave every service Better or Worse may we leave this one better because of the inside teacher that's spoke into our life I pray you granted Lord if someone here's not had that
