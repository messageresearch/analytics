[1:06:00] brother sean martin
[1:06:01] and all the saints there at faith
[1:06:02] tabernacle bringing greetings from home
[1:06:04] this evening
[1:06:05] and in the book of matthew the 21st
[1:06:07] chapter and the first verse
[1:06:10] the bible says when they drew nai
[1:06:13] unto jerusalem and were coming to beth
[1:06:16] age unto the mount of olives
[1:06:18] olives then sent jesus to disciples
[1:06:21] saying unto them go into the village
[1:06:24] over against you
[1:06:26] and straightway ye shall find an ass
[1:06:28] tied and a cult with her
[1:06:30] loose them and bring them unto me and if
[1:06:32] any man say alt unto you
[1:06:34] ye shall say the lord hath need of them
[1:06:37] and straightway he will send them and
[1:06:40] this
[1:06:41] was done that it might be fulfilled
[1:06:45] which was spoken by the prophet saying
[1:06:47] so this was
[1:06:48] this was done to fulfill scripture to
[1:06:50] fulfill the word
[1:06:51] tell ye the daughter of zion behold the
[1:06:54] king cometh unto thee
[1:06:55] meek and sitting upon an ass and the
[1:06:58] colt the foal of an ass and the
[1:07:00] disciples went
[1:07:01] and did as jesus commanded them and
[1:07:03] brought the ass and the colt and put on
[1:07:05] them their clothes and they set
[1:07:07] him there on notice in a very great
[1:07:09] multitude
[1:07:10] spread their garments in the way and
[1:07:13] others cut down branches from the trees
[1:07:15] and strawed them in the way now that
[1:07:17] word multitude actually means common
[1:07:19] people so it wasn't any special
[1:07:21] superhumans it was there it was actually
[1:07:22] common people
[1:07:24] and the multitudes that went before and
[1:07:25] that followed cried saying
[1:07:28] hosanna to the son of david blessed is
[1:07:30] he that cometh in the name of the lord
[1:07:33] hosanna in the highest now when he was
[1:07:36] come into jerusalem
[1:07:37] all the city was moved somebody say
[1:07:40] moved all the city
[1:07:43] was moved saying who is this
[1:07:46] and the multitude said this is jesus
[1:07:50] the prophet of nazareth of galilee
[1:07:53] amen i like that the multitude or the
[1:07:56] common people said
[1:07:57] this is jesus amen the prophet of
[1:07:59] nazareth of
[1:08:00] galilee now if we could look in the book
[1:08:02] of romans the eighth chapter
[1:08:04] romans the eighth chapter in just one
[1:08:06] verse i want to read there with you this
[1:08:08] evening
[1:08:09] we'll find our assignment from the word
[1:08:11] in the scriptures this evening romans 18
[1:08:14] and verse 19 a very very familiar
[1:08:17] scripture here to the believers
[1:08:18] but paul writing here in the 19th verse
[1:08:21] he says
[1:08:22] for the earnest expectation of the
[1:08:25] creature
[1:08:26] waiteth for the manifestation notice
[1:08:29] here he doesn't say
[1:08:30] of the son of god but he says for the
[1:08:33] manifestation of the
[1:08:35] sons of god so amen he's not just
[1:08:38] looking for the manifestation of the son
[1:08:40] of god he's looking for the
[1:08:41] manifestation of these sons of god
[1:08:43] for the creature was made subject to
[1:08:45] vanity not willing
[1:08:47] but by reason of him who is subjected
[1:08:49] the same in hope
[1:08:50] because the creature itself also shall
[1:08:53] be delivered from the bondage of
[1:08:55] corruption somebody say
[1:08:56] into the glorious liberty
[1:09:00] of the children of god amen not any kind
[1:09:03] of liberty
[1:09:04] but being delivered into the glorious
[1:09:06] liberty we ask the lord this evening to
[1:09:08] add the blessing
[1:09:09] to the reading of his word as you may
[1:09:10] have your seats there
[1:09:12] this afternoon for just a few moments if
[1:09:14] the lord would help me
[1:09:15] uh from these scriptures tonight i would
[1:09:17] like to minister to you on
[1:09:19] drawn by the spirit to the attraction
[1:09:22] drawn by the spirit to the attraction i
[1:09:25] i believeth all of my heart this evening
[1:09:27] that the lord
[1:09:28] amen has allowed us to come together one
[1:09:30] more time amen aren't you thankful for
[1:09:32] that
[1:09:33] amen think about this time last year and
[1:09:34] we were just trying to really start
[1:09:36] having meetings again and cove and
[1:09:38] everything and shut things down
[1:09:39] amen but here tonight the lord has
[1:09:41] allowed us to come together
[1:09:43] one more time and maybe if i could say
[1:09:44] it this way the lord has brought us
[1:09:46] together
[1:09:47] amen or the lord has drawn us together
[1:09:49] one more time now
[1:09:51] you realize we are not drawn here by the
[1:09:53] will of man we are not drawn here by the
[1:09:55] desires of man
[1:09:56] amen but we are drawn here by the will
[1:09:58] of god now amen when you begin to look
[1:10:00] at the drawing power of god
[1:10:02] you'll read there in song of solomon the
[1:10:03] first chapter and the fourth verse the
[1:10:05] bible says
[1:10:06] draw me and we will run after thee the
[1:10:09] king hath brought me into his chambers
[1:10:11] and we will be glad
[1:10:12] and rejoice in thee and we will remember
[1:10:15] thou love more than wine
[1:10:16] the upright love thee in jeremiah 31
[1:10:19] verse 3 the lord hath appeared unto me
[1:10:21] of old
[1:10:22] amen saying yea i have loved thee with
[1:10:24] an everlasting love aren't in that good
[1:10:26] to know
[1:10:27] that you are loved tonight with not a
[1:10:29] temporary love but an everlasting love
[1:10:31] amen
[1:10:32] amen it's not a filial love but it is an
[1:10:34] agape love which is the love of god
[1:10:36] amen therefore with loving kindness have
[1:10:39] i drawn these so god is telling his
[1:10:41] people
[1:10:41] he meant with loving kindness have i
[1:10:43] drawn thee that word loving kindness
[1:10:45] actually means
[1:10:46] amen goodness it means kindness and it
[1:10:48] means faithfulness so in other words
[1:10:50] he's saying we are being drawn by the
[1:10:52] goodness of god we are being drawn by
[1:10:54] the kindness of god
[1:10:56] amen we are being drawn by the
[1:10:58] faithfulness of god so when you read
[1:10:59] that
[1:11:00] amen you realize there's something more
[1:11:02] than a man here at work
[1:11:03] amen but there is a supernatural being
[1:11:06] here at work there's more than just
[1:11:07] amen a prophet here at work but there is
[1:11:09] a supernatural god on the scene
[1:11:11] amen when you leave the old testament
[1:11:13] and go to the new in john 6 44
[1:11:15] jesus is going to say no man come to me
[1:11:18] except the father which has sent me
[1:11:20] amen draw him notice this it's not you
[1:11:23] coming on your own accord
[1:11:25] amen but there's something drawing you
[1:11:26] and i will raise him up at the last day
[1:11:29] he would go to say in john 12 32 and i
[1:11:32] amen if i be lifted up from the earth
[1:11:34] will draw all men unto me amen
[1:11:37] and then he's going to draw him and he's
[1:11:39] going to be lifted up
[1:11:40] amen then whatever is being lifted up
[1:11:42] before the people is what has got the
[1:11:44] power
[1:11:45] amen to draw the people see that word
[1:11:47] draw there means to drag off it means to
[1:11:50] draw
[1:11:50] amen by an inward power it means to lead
[1:11:53] amen
[1:11:54] it means to impale then to think tonight
[1:11:56] amen that you're not being involved by
[1:11:58] the outside
[1:11:59] amen but there's something on the inside
[1:12:01] calling you to what you've been drawn to
[1:12:03] tonight
[1:12:04] and then the prophet says in thirsting
[1:12:05] for life one thing we do
[1:12:07] amen is we just cast the net in and then
[1:12:10] draw it but the holy spirit draws amen
[1:12:12] jesus
[1:12:13] said if i be lifted up i will draw all
[1:12:16] men unto me
[1:12:17] in the message the token 63 you take
[1:12:19] ducks when it's time for swarming amen
[1:12:22] they all run together when bees and
[1:12:24] everything else get ready
[1:12:25] he said there is some instinct in them
[1:12:28] amen that draws them there's an
[1:12:30] instinct in the duck there's an instinct
[1:12:32] in the bee there's an instinct in the
[1:12:34] bird that draws them together amen for
[1:12:36] the swarm or for the run
[1:12:38] amen and the prophet said the holy
[1:12:40] spirit amen draws the people
[1:12:42] amen let me say tonight if there is an
[1:12:44] instinct in nature
[1:12:46] amen then there's a living god in
[1:12:47] humanity tonight
[1:12:49] amen that it's more than a man that has
[1:12:50] pulled you together
[1:12:52] amen let me just say this a flyer didn't
[1:12:54] bring you to this building tonight
[1:12:56] amen a preacher's name didn't bring you
[1:12:58] to this building tonight
[1:12:59] amen but if you are here amen it's
[1:13:01] because there's a deep calling to the
[1:13:03] deep
[1:13:04] and there's something on the inside of
[1:13:05] you amen that when it feels the least
[1:13:08] bit of tug
[1:13:09] when it feels at least better than pale
[1:13:11] amen from the spirit of god there's
[1:13:13] something in you says
[1:13:14] i can't sit here amen i've got to go
[1:13:17] amen what is that that
[1:13:18] is the holy spirit and then drawing the
[1:13:21] people together
[1:13:22] i think of isaiah the 43rd chapter and
[1:13:24] the fifth verse says fear not
[1:13:26] amen for i am with thee and i will bring
[1:13:29] thy seed somebody shout thy seed
[1:13:32] amen i will bring thy seed amen from the
[1:13:35] east and gather thee from the west
[1:13:37] and i will say to the north amen give up
[1:13:40] and to the south keep not back
[1:13:42] and bring my sons from afar and my
[1:13:44] daughters from the ends of the earth
[1:13:46] every one of them that is called by my
[1:13:48] name for i
[1:13:49] have created him amen for my glory i
[1:13:52] have formed him
[1:13:53] amen god said yea i have made him amen
[1:13:56] what does that tell me
[1:13:58] brother matt that tells me when god gets
[1:14:00] ready amen to gather his people together
[1:14:03] amen the east is not strong enough to
[1:14:05] hold him back
[1:14:06] and the west is not strong enough to
[1:14:08] keep him apart oh come on church
[1:14:10] and then when god wants to draw people
[1:14:12] together amen it don't matter what walls
[1:14:14] that a man is built
[1:14:16] it don't matter what lies or the
[1:14:17] preacher is told it don't matter what
[1:14:19] denominational differences are there
[1:14:22] when god says i will gather my people
[1:14:24] and then the north has to give up
[1:14:26] and the south has to turn loose what do
[1:14:28] you say in church i'm saying fear not
[1:14:31] amen god has brought us together tonight
[1:14:33] he has made these meetings not for a man
[1:14:36] to be glorified
[1:14:37] a member for his seed amen to let go for
[1:14:40] just a few moments
[1:14:41] and begin to praise god until we forget
[1:14:44] about our problems
[1:14:45] do we forget about our situation don't
[1:14:47] we forget about who heard us
[1:14:49] oh come on church we've not gathered for
[1:14:51] tonight to see a man glorified
[1:14:54] we have gathered here tonight amen to
[1:14:56] lift up the son of man
[1:14:57] he said if i'll be lifted up i will draw
[1:15:00] all men
[1:15:01] unto myself and when you see him you
[1:15:03] realize you're not there on your own
[1:15:05] accord
[1:15:06] but there was something in you amen that
[1:15:08] was stronger than the bad day you had
[1:15:10] there was something in you that was
[1:15:12] stronger than the mistakes you made
[1:15:14] that literally pulled you into the
[1:15:16] presence
[1:15:17] of jesus christ
[1:15:20] no i'm not a crazy man i am a believer
[1:15:23] that this message
[1:15:24] has still got the power amen to draw
[1:15:27] sinners
[1:15:28] this message has still got the power
[1:15:30] amen to put back spiders
[1:15:32] and then back on the front row with the
[1:15:34] fire burning in their soul
[1:15:35] this message hasn't lost its power it's
[1:15:38] got more power today
[1:15:40] amen than any denominational preacher
[1:15:42] this message has got more power
[1:15:44] than any idea of a man it is the holy
[1:15:47] spirit
[1:15:48] amen who is drawing oh
[1:15:51] god has drawn us together am i to think
[1:15:53] the prophet said
[1:15:54] there's no two holy spirits isn't that
[1:15:58] good
[1:15:58] there's no two holy spirits there's only
[1:16:01] one
[1:16:01] and the same holy spirit that gave samia
[1:16:04] in that promise is the same holy spirit
[1:16:08] that has drawed you here tonight he said
[1:16:10] is that right
[1:16:11] he made you come sister and he made you
[1:16:13] come sister
[1:16:14] he said in you and you and you and every
[1:16:18] one of you
[1:16:18] he brought you here
[1:16:23] don't that make you want to shout a
[1:16:24] minute amen he
[1:16:26] brought you here he said the devil would
[1:16:29] never bring you around a place like this
[1:16:32] he said i'll guarantee you that he meant
[1:16:34] the holy ghost
[1:16:36] brought you here if you believe in
[1:16:38] divine healing
[1:16:39] then the holy spirit brought you where
[1:16:42] there's a fountain
[1:16:43] of divine healing open in the house of
[1:16:46] god
[1:16:46] he said just like he did simeon you
[1:16:49] embrace
[1:16:50] god's promise the same way that simeon
[1:16:52] did
[1:16:53] and then now let me just take a time out
[1:16:55] here and say this amen there's no two
[1:16:57] holy ghosts
[1:16:58] amen then that tells me amen the same
[1:17:01] holy ghost that revealed isaiah's
[1:17:04] prophecy
[1:17:04] amen to a man named simeon is the same
[1:17:08] holy ghost that is in the church of the
[1:17:10] living god tonight
[1:17:11] that is not revealing he meant another
[1:17:14] idea
[1:17:15] he is revealing the message of the hour
[1:17:17] putting a hunger in the first
[1:17:19] in the heart of people to go get what
[1:17:22] the message said they could have
[1:17:24] see if there's a hunger there for divine
[1:17:25] healing there's a fountain open to
[1:17:27] receive it
[1:17:28] if there's a
[1:17:42] amen
[1:17:55] she was blind amen naturally he meant
[1:17:58] she was physically blind
[1:18:00] he said but that didn't change her
[1:18:01] spiritual sight
[1:18:03] he meant because the holy ghost was not
[1:18:05] leading her
[1:18:06] by her physical disabilities he meant he
[1:18:09] was leading her
[1:18:10] and then by the inward power that was on
[1:18:12] the inside of her
[1:18:13] oh glory to god amen don't you see why
[1:18:16] you're here tonight
[1:18:17] amen because you're outward man it's
[1:18:19] perishing day by day
[1:18:21] but there's an inward man in there who
[1:18:23] is feeling a pull
[1:18:24] who is stealing a brawl who is filled
[1:18:26] with dragon off
[1:18:27] who is feeling an impaling power on the
[1:18:30] inside of your heart
[1:18:31] that says if i just get in the presence
[1:18:33] of god
[1:18:34] something will take place he said yes
[1:18:36] sir he
[1:18:37] is here tonight somebody shout he is
[1:18:40] here tonight
[1:18:42] he has risen from the dead and he's
[1:18:44] given you the promise

[1:18:50] you together if the holy spirit hadn't

[1:19:46] glory upon this building here
[1:19:48] that many would receive the baptism of
[1:19:51] the holy spirit
[1:19:52] he meant and sinners would weep their
[1:19:54] weight at calvary and the sick would be
[1:19:56] healed

[1:27:55] a bunch of confusion

[1:27:59] this message there's still deliverance
[1:28:01] in this message
[1:28:02] there's still a god who'll come down on
[1:28:04] a friday night
[1:28:05] and he'll meet a young girl we'll meet a
[1:28:07] young boy that'll give him an experience
[1:28:10] that'll keep him in treacherous waters
[1:28:12] it'll keep them
[1:28:13] in dangerous waters it'll keep them when
[1:28:16] the world is falling apart
[1:28:18] there'll be a young person that'll be
[1:28:20] anchored by the message of the hour
[1:28:25] i ain't backing up and i ain't backing
[1:28:27] down i ain't got time for nonsense
[1:28:29] there's an attraction here there's a
[1:28:32] carcass here
[1:28:33] there's an anointing here there's a
[1:28:35] living god here
[1:28:38] where the carcass is and then there the
[1:28:41] eagles

[1:29:05] amen as people dismiss the carcass and
[1:29:08] they get a bunch of buzzards show up and
[1:29:10] then they get mad at the eagles for not
[1:29:11] showing up
[1:29:14] oh preaching now aren't we amen they get
[1:29:17] but let me just tell you this
[1:29:18] you're not going to draw an eagle by
[1:29:20] some dedication
[1:29:21] that's been laying in the church for 30
[1:29:23] years and your security blanket won't
[1:29:25] let you turn it loose
[1:29:28] well let's just preach we're here we
[1:29:30] might as well amen well brother andrew
[1:29:32] brother branham said this
[1:29:33] and i don't amen that's a security
[1:29:35] blanket that you've been holding on to
[1:29:37] cause you don't want no emotion the
[1:29:38] church
[1:29:39] but don't you get rid of that thing
[1:29:40] tonight
[1:29:43] it's not got no power to draw people
[1:29:49] well you love the lord are you with me
[1:29:53] there's a message here there's an
[1:29:55] attraction here there's a
[1:29:56] there's there's a there's a word in due
[1:29:58] season brother bram says what is it the
[1:30:00] carcass
[1:30:01] amen where the carcass is there the
[1:30:03] eagles will be together
[1:30:04] we're the fresh kill is we're something
[1:30:07] that's not dead
[1:30:08] and stagnated but something that's fresh
[1:30:11] and got some life in it
[1:30:15] now what does the word attraction mean
[1:30:18] it means the action or the power of
[1:30:21] evoking interest
[1:30:23] it means pleasure or lacking for someone
[1:30:26] or something
[1:30:27] now think about this it is a quality or
[1:30:30] a feature
[1:30:31] that evokes interest lacking or desire
[1:30:34] i love this one brother braden it's a
[1:30:36] place which draws visitors
[1:30:39] by providing something a man of interest
[1:30:42] or pleasure
[1:30:43] are you ready for this it is a force
[1:30:46] under the influence
[1:30:47] of which an object am intends to move
[1:30:51] toward each other it's an example
[1:30:53] gravitational
[1:30:55] amen attraction amen think about that
[1:30:57] amen do you realize dolly parton
[1:31:00] is not standing at the gate of dollywood
[1:31:02] every day
[1:31:04] are you hearing me dolly parton's not
[1:31:06] standing there he meant signing
[1:31:08] autographs

[1:31:12] for a second okay
[1:31:13] amen she's not standing there brother
[1:31:15] dale he met every day giving out a cup
[1:31:17] and
[1:31:17] signed picture amen but there's
[1:31:19] something in that
[1:31:20] theme park that's got the power he meant
[1:31:23] to draw people from all over the world
[1:31:25] amen to receive pleasure
[1:31:29] to receive interest they meant to invoke
[1:31:31] something in them or y'all hear me
[1:31:33] amen dolly parents not standing there
[1:31:35] they've been begging people to come
[1:31:37] to her stampede and then there's an
[1:31:39] attraction
[1:31:40] and there's something in the attraction
[1:31:42] that's got the power amen to pull the
[1:31:44] people to the attraction
[1:31:46] oh glory to god are you hearing me
[1:31:48] church there are different types of
[1:31:50] attractions
[1:31:51] there's natural attractions amen then
[1:31:53] there's spiritual attractions
[1:31:55] amen there's worldly attractions amen
[1:31:57] and there's godly attraction
[1:31:59] and the world has an attraction and the
[1:32:01] church has an attraction
[1:32:03] and god never intended somebody shout
[1:32:05] god
[1:32:06] never intended amen didn't know who's
[1:32:08] got me priest did you
[1:32:10] god never intended he meant for the
[1:32:12] world's attraction
[1:32:14] to be the church's attraction
[1:32:17] he never intended amen for the world's
[1:32:20] attraction
[1:32:21] ain't meant to be the church's
[1:32:22] attraction remember when the church
[1:32:24] loses its attraction when it comes to a
[1:32:26] time
[1:32:27] that you got to sign cards and things to
[1:32:30] come to church
[1:32:30] i think it's time for a prayer meeting i
[1:32:33] think it's time
[1:32:34] amen that something takes place in the
[1:32:36] church i'll tell you what i believe
[1:32:38] i believe when it comes to a time that
[1:32:40] the only time you show up
[1:32:42] is when your favorite preacher's in town
[1:32:44] it's time for a prayer meet
[1:32:46] i think that the only time you show up
[1:32:48] is on a special meeting
[1:32:50] i think it's time for a prayer meet i
[1:32:52] think it's time
[1:32:53] amen to fall down before god and say
[1:32:56] holy ghost
[1:32:56] amen light of fire inside of my soul
[1:32:59] it'll put a hunger
[1:33:00] and a thirst for the house of god
[1:33:03] when the church loses its attraction you
[1:33:06] might as well padlock the doors
[1:33:08] and cut off the power
[1:33:12] but well here it is again the church is
[1:33:15] becoming these days with its achievement
[1:33:17] like all of the man-made achievements he
[1:33:19] said is becoming scientific oh there we
[1:33:22] hit one didn't we
[1:33:23] i mean they don't want to preach the
[1:33:24] power of the message they want to preach
[1:33:26] some psychologist
[1:33:27] or some scientist idea but a prophet
[1:33:29] said they're trying
[1:33:30] they meant to make a scientific church
[1:33:33] by the attraction
[1:33:34] of pictures and great steeples and it's
[1:33:37] too bad that pentecost
[1:33:39] amen god in that rut are you ready for
[1:33:41] this you would be better off
[1:33:43] with a tambourine amen down on the
[1:33:46] corner
[1:33:46] and the spirit of god around you
[1:33:50] come on brother sister are you hearing
[1:33:53] me hey man i studied the other day
[1:33:54] brother ben
[1:33:55] and then i heard a quote where the
[1:33:56] prophet of god said amen we're
[1:33:58] like a bunch of cows ain't been over in
[1:34:00] a barn they've been kicking our heels up
[1:34:02] and having a holy ghost time
[1:34:06] you know why you gotta almost you almost
[1:34:08] got to pay your kid to go to science
[1:34:09] class
[1:34:10] cause there's no life in there you know
[1:34:12] why you gotta beg them
[1:34:13] ain't meant to go to school it's cause
[1:34:15] there's no life in there
[1:34:16] there's no sustaining power there's no
[1:34:18] joy in a dry-eyed lesson
[1:34:20] amen but you know why we're not going to
[1:34:22] turn the house of god
[1:34:24] into a scientific bunch of dried
[1:34:26] connections it's because there's no life
[1:34:28] in it
[1:34:30] well come on church amen take the fire
[1:34:33] of the church
[1:34:34] you've taken the attraction out of the
[1:34:35] church take the holy ghost down the
[1:34:37] church
[1:34:38] you've taken the power out of the church
[1:34:39] but if we just come together
[1:34:41] and we forget who is who and we forget
[1:34:44] where we come from
[1:34:45] and we forget what we're doing and we
[1:34:47] remember jesus said brother harvey
[1:34:49] if i will i will draw all men
[1:34:53] unto myself when we come together to
[1:34:56] lift up jesus
[1:34:58] amen eagles will come together and
[1:35:00] eaglets will be born
[1:35:02] around the attraction
[1:35:07] amen why you feel like dancing cause i
[1:35:09] just happen to feel like
[1:35:11] i'm in the presence of some eagles
[1:35:15] i just feel like i'm in the presence of
[1:35:17] some eagles
[1:35:19] now your servant andrew what is their
[1:35:21] drawing card science
[1:35:22] has become the drawing card of
[1:35:24] denomination
[1:35:26] what the prophet said amen but god's
[1:35:28] drawing card
[1:35:30] has never changed
[1:35:33] somebody shout never changed what is
[1:35:35] god's drawing card
[1:35:37] the gospel
[1:35:42] yet in its simplicity is the greatest
[1:35:45] drawing card
[1:35:46] the world has ever known jesus said

[1:37:03] white
[1:37:03] he said the ame is predominantly black i
[1:37:06] said you mean to tell me
[1:37:07] that there ain't enough power in what
[1:37:08] you're all what you all are preaching
[1:37:10] that you can't even get together in the
[1:37:12] same building
[1:37:13] was that okay i said you mean to tell me
[1:37:16] you got to have a black methodist and a
[1:37:18] white man for this and you're going to
[1:37:20] have a black pentecostal
[1:37:21] come on church amen that's not what the
[1:37:24] gospel come to produce
[1:37:25] the gospel comes amen to bring the black
[1:37:28] man together
[1:37:29] to bring the red men together to bring
[1:37:31] the alamance together
[1:37:32] until they all come together and lift up

[1:37:46] division
[1:37:47] lift him above the problems lift him
[1:37:49] above the confusion
[1:37:50] there is power in the attraction to
[1:37:53] bring together divisions
[1:37:56] are you hearing me amen the gospel still
[1:38:00] holds the attraction to every man
[1:38:03] and every woman i think we're trying to
[1:38:05] look too much to see
[1:38:06] what somebody else done or said instead
[1:38:09] of looking forward to christ he
[1:38:13] is our leader oh
[1:38:16] brother ben he is our leader
[1:38:21] now now people actually say whether they
[1:38:24] say the gospel
[1:38:25] has lost its attraction but i'll tell
[1:38:27] you what the prophet said
[1:38:28] he said people tries to say the gospel
[1:38:30] lost its attraction
[1:38:32] he said when people come from across the
[1:38:34] nation
[1:38:35] to stand in a place where their limbs
[1:38:38] are hurting
[1:38:39] amen for a service of the lord it still
[1:38:42] shows that god's got people and there's
[1:38:45] still
[1:38:46] a longing in their heart to see god
[1:38:49] amen can i can i testify amen here for a
[1:38:52] moment about a family in this church

[1:38:59] a grandson
[1:39:00] amen and a son and a family in the house
[1:39:03] of god
[1:39:04] you know why because brother harvey's
[1:39:06] attraction was the gospel
[1:39:07] and he didn't let it lose an attraction
[1:39:10] and it become the attraction of his
[1:39:11] children
[1:39:12] and his grandchildren amen that family
[1:39:14] in this building tonight
[1:39:15] is a testimony there's still a hunger in
[1:39:18] the hearts of people
[1:39:20] that no matter what they're going
[1:39:21] through and no matter what they're
[1:39:23] facing
[1:39:23] they just know if i get in the presence
[1:39:27] of the attraction something is going to
[1:39:30] happen
[1:39:33] if i just get in the presence of the
[1:39:36] attraction
[1:39:36] ain't that it'll release something in me
[1:39:39] that nobody
[1:39:40] else can give me
[1:39:43] glory the gospel has not lost its
[1:39:47] attraction
[1:39:48] what is the gospel it was so important
[1:39:51] that god said
[1:39:52] go into all the world and preach
[1:39:55] the attraction and then preach the
[1:39:57] gospel
[1:39:58] what is the gospel the gospel is the
[1:40:01] good news
[1:40:04] oh brother josh the gospel is the good
[1:40:07] news amen not
[1:40:08] the word only amen but the power
[1:40:13] and the demonstration of the spirit paul
[1:40:16] said
[1:40:16] not not swelled words and enchanting
[1:40:19] lips
[1:40:20] and doxology and apostles creed i never
[1:40:23] come to you like that
[1:40:24] i come in the resurrection and
[1:40:27] demonstration
[1:40:28] of the holy ghost
[1:40:31] see then let me say this the gospel is
[1:40:34] making his word come to pass see we have
[1:40:37] many creeds
[1:40:38] amen but there is one gospel we have
[1:40:41] many ideas
[1:40:42] but there is one gospel it is god making
[1:40:45] his word
[1:40:46] amen come to pass then jesus
[1:40:48] emphatically screamed
[1:40:50] out going into all the world amen and
[1:40:52] make seminaries
[1:40:53] no sir build churches no sir build
[1:40:56] hospitals
[1:40:57] no sir they was commissioned amen to
[1:41:00] preach the word
[1:41:01] and to preach the gospel amen go into
[1:41:04] all the world are you ready
[1:41:05] and demonstrate the power of the
[1:41:08] resurrection
[1:41:09] amen time out here for a second that's
[1:41:12] why they got a bunch of irelands around
[1:41:13] this message
[1:41:14] that's afraid of an altar call they're
[1:41:16] afraid of a prayer line they're afraid
[1:41:18] to get down there
[1:41:19] and say bring whatever condition you got
[1:41:21] we're going to stand here
[1:41:23] and we're going to pray till that thing
[1:41:24] breaks you know why because they're a
[1:41:27] scientific preacher
[1:41:28] with a bunch of scientific up
[1:41:30] knowledge but i say what we need tonight
[1:41:32] is the holy ghost in the power and the
[1:41:36] demonstration
[1:41:37] of his word now let me say this
[1:41:40] you're looking at one preacher that's
[1:41:42] not afraid to take god in his word
[1:41:46] are you hear me i'm not afraid amen to
[1:41:49] take god in his word
[1:41:50] i've stood in foreign countries and
[1:41:53] preached this message
[1:41:54] and seen the god that called me to
[1:41:56] preach it
[1:41:57] come on the scene to back it up i have
[1:41:59] stood
[1:42:00] in prayer lines and seen demons raised
[1:42:02] up out of vessels
[1:42:04] and seen god come on the scene and cast
[1:42:06] out those demons what are you saying
[1:42:08] preacher
[1:42:08] i'm saying if this attraction is worth
[1:42:10] preaching it's worth giving the people
[1:42:12] an opportunity to experience
[1:42:16] [Applause]
[1:42:18] come on church if this message is worth
[1:42:21] preaching
[1:42:21] it's worth having a prayer line for i
[1:42:24] said if this message
[1:42:25] is worth talking about it's worth
[1:42:27] opening the altar up
[1:42:29] and let young people come and receive a
[1:42:31] good old-fashioned boast
[1:42:33] of the holy ghost prescription until sin
[1:42:36] and bitterness and complexes and holds
[1:42:39] of the enemy
[1:42:40] is eradicated out of their lives and
[1:42:42] they stand
[1:42:43] in the presence of the sun free free
[1:42:46] indeed
[1:42:49] see there's something about this message
[1:42:52] it is the attraction
[1:42:53] and we're not afraid to put it in the
[1:42:55] ground
[1:42:57] are you hearing me we are not afraid
[1:43:00] amen to plant this message
[1:43:02] in the ground to the heart of the
[1:43:03] individual the prophet said i read in
[1:43:06] life magazine
[1:43:07] where they took oh god come on he said
[1:43:10] where they took a handful
[1:43:13] of seed out of the garners of joseph of
[1:43:15] wheat
[1:43:16] and they planted it in the ground and it
[1:43:18] growed
[1:43:19] and he said they got a they got a
[1:43:21] sunflower seed 4
[1:43:22] 000 years ago out of old king touched
[1:43:25] tomb and a sunfire seed planted
[1:43:27] and god had preserved that life though
[1:43:30] the skin worms
[1:43:31] amen destroys this body yet in my flesh
[1:43:34] shall i see god
[1:43:35] he said god's word will never be
[1:43:39] destroyed let's say that together god's
[1:43:41] word
[1:43:42] will never be destroyed god's word
[1:43:46] if you'll plant it in the right kind of
[1:43:48] a condition
[1:43:49] on god's word are you ready it will do
[1:43:51] the same thing
[1:43:53] that it did at the beginning
[1:43:56] if you just plant it in the heart of the
[1:43:59] individual
[1:44:00] amen brother john that message that seed
[1:44:03] will produce exactly what it produced in
[1:44:05] the beginning
[1:44:06] amen but let me say this man is trying
[1:44:09] to turn things towards nothing but
[1:44:10] beauty
[1:44:11] so beauty has become another drawing
[1:44:13] card to denomination
[1:44:16] well he said they did he said the old
[1:44:18] church the overcomers
[1:44:20] he said they didn't have beautiful
[1:44:21] buildings and gown choirs
[1:44:23] and find clothes and other worldly
[1:44:25] attractions he said but now
[1:44:27] in this special promise to the true
[1:44:29] believers god
[1:44:30] has declared he will give them rewards
[1:44:33] of great beauty and eternal duration
[1:44:36] see so the old the old believers the
[1:44:39] overcomers the
[1:44:40] how can i say this the children of god
[1:44:43] that have run the race before us
[1:44:45] they were not drawn to beauty they were
[1:44:47] not drawn to science
[1:44:49] they were drawn to the supernatural
[1:44:52] element of the living god now the
[1:44:54] prophet said and then after the decision
[1:44:56] i speak in here of a conference with god
[1:44:58] and he's going to show you
[1:44:59] that when attractions are made they're
[1:45:01] actually designed
[1:45:03] he meant to catch the attention of the
[1:45:05] human spirit
[1:45:08] so amen so so when the human spirit gets
[1:45:10] low
[1:45:11] amen they're designed to lift it up
[1:45:13] right amen when the human spirit gets
[1:45:15] nervous
[1:45:16] they're designed to bring a peace to it
[1:45:18] now do you realize the world we live in
[1:45:19] is full of attractions
[1:45:21] amen now now some families amen are
[1:45:23] drawn to amusement parks
[1:45:25] for their vacations i'm not telling you
[1:45:28] just just listen to me okay and i know
[1:45:30] brother come to my time he said
[1:45:31] i don't want people listen i don't know
[1:45:33] where you feel that to go get between
[1:45:34] you and the lord and your pastor in
[1:45:35] church hey man i'm just trying to make a
[1:45:37] point here okay
[1:45:38] can we all agree but andrew's just
[1:45:40] trying to make a point
[1:45:42] some people are drawn to to the ocean
[1:45:45] some are drawn to the mountains
[1:45:47] they've been summer drawn amen i get in
[1:45:49] trouble here
[1:45:50] amen they've been summer drawn to go
[1:45:52] look at history like my wife
[1:45:54] amen now i like history they meant but
[1:45:57] there's one back there so you're not
[1:45:59] myself are you hearing me amen but but
[1:46:02] listen
[1:46:02] there's something there that pulls that
[1:46:04] human spirit to it
[1:46:05] see when you go the ocean you don't do
[1:46:08] one thing for the ocean
[1:46:09] amen the ocean does it for you when you
[1:46:12] go to the mountains
[1:46:13] you don't do one thing for the mountains
[1:46:15] amen the mountains does it for you
[1:46:18] when you go to the amusement park you
[1:46:20] don't do one thing for that amusement
[1:46:21] park
[1:46:22] the amusement park does it for you when
[1:46:24] you go read about the
[1:46:26] battle a minute for it wherever amen
[1:46:28] that don't do no you don't do nothing
[1:46:29] for it
[1:46:30] amen it does something for you
[1:46:33] are y'all hear me tonight amen there's
[1:46:35] something in there
[1:46:37] that contacts your human spirit and
[1:46:39] draws you to it and the prophet said
[1:46:41] like this
[1:46:42] he said when they plan to have a
[1:46:43] conference they're always trying to find
[1:46:45] someplace beautiful
[1:46:48] he said like the geneva conference and
[1:46:50] paris and different places
[1:46:52] he said what is it he said if it's
[1:46:54] peaceful and attractive
[1:46:56] it seems to work on the human spirit
[1:46:58] notice this
[1:47:00] many times for myself i like to climb a
[1:47:03] mountain
[1:47:03] and watch a sunset that just thrills me
[1:47:07] it looks like all my differences
[1:47:10] is settled in the presence of my
[1:47:13] attraction
[1:47:18] that's a shouting point right there
[1:47:21] he didn't do nothing for those mountains
[1:47:24] but when he got
[1:47:25] in the presence of the mountains the
[1:47:28] mountains released an atmosphere
[1:47:30] that caused all of his differences to be
[1:47:33] settled
[1:47:34] the mountains released an atmosphere
[1:47:37] that brought a peace
[1:47:38] upon his heart what are you saying
[1:47:40] brother andrew i'm saying just get
[1:47:42] in the presence of the attraction and it
[1:47:45] will settle the differences
[1:47:50] are you hearing me just get in the
[1:47:52] present to the attraction
[1:47:54] you don't have to put nothing in it amen
[1:47:56] you don't have to put something in it to
[1:47:57] give you peace
[1:47:58] you don't have to put something in it to
[1:48:00] give you a release this attraction
[1:48:02] will bring a peace over your family
[1:48:09] brother andrew i don't think you know
[1:48:10] what you're talking about well you've
[1:48:12] come too late to tell me that
[1:48:14] because i've stood in message churches
[1:48:16] i've spent a message church and preached
[1:48:18] this message and seen a mother at odds
[1:48:20] with a daughter
[1:48:21] and both of them end up at the altar at
[1:48:24] the end of the service
[1:48:25] even with their arms around each other
[1:48:27] they've been hugging each other's neck
[1:48:32] you know what done it the preaching of
[1:48:35] the message
[1:48:36] which is the attraction see then this
[1:48:39] evening friends
[1:48:40] the new birth amen will actually change
[1:48:43] what you are attracted to and it will
[1:48:45] quicken
[1:48:46] an understanding of why you're there
[1:48:51] [Music]
[1:48:54] now what was it what was it mean to be
[1:48:56] drawn it meant to be led by what
[1:48:59] an inward power now the prophet comes
[1:49:02] along in the church age book
[1:49:03] and says we did not become seed by the
[1:49:06] rebirth
[1:49:11] oh i heard brother brown preaching
[1:49:12] spoken words original see the other day
[1:49:14] he got secured away in the scriptures he
[1:49:15] went i'm about to leave here
[1:49:18] amen we did not become seed amen by the
[1:49:22] rebirth
[1:49:22] we were seed and therefore were reborn
[1:49:26] for only the elect can be reborn
[1:49:31] are you ready because we were seed
[1:49:35] is the reason we could be quickened
[1:49:37] because
[1:49:38] in non-seed there is nothing to quicken
[1:49:44] because in seed there was something that
[1:49:48] could be quickened
[1:49:49] because in non-seed there is nothing to
[1:49:52] be quickened
[1:49:53] see then you can be in the presence of
[1:49:56] the attraction
[1:49:57] but unless you have been quickened it'll
[1:50:00] have no effect on you
[1:50:04] all right now i'm gonna preach it for a
[1:50:05] second unless you've been quickened
[1:50:08] it'll have no it'll make no difference
[1:50:10] upon your life
[1:50:11] but if you've been quickened amen by a
[1:50:13] seed
[1:50:14] then that seed inside of you was not
[1:50:17] placed there
[1:50:18] by your mama was not placed there by
[1:50:21] your father
[1:50:21] was not placed there by your preacher it
[1:50:24] wasn't placed there when you heard the
[1:50:25] first tape as a young girl
[1:50:27] amen that seed was placed there by the
[1:50:30] attraction
[1:50:31] himself
[1:50:35] that makes me want to dance the seed
[1:50:38] amen was placed there
[1:50:39] by the attraction himself therefore
[1:50:43] when the attraction would become
[1:50:45] manifested you wouldn't have to wonder
[1:50:48] what is the attraction on the mountain
[1:50:50] there would be something
[1:50:51] in you that would be testified of what
[1:50:54] it is
[1:50:55] when nobody else understood it there
[1:50:57] would be something
[1:50:58] in a young boy in a young girl in a man
[1:51:01] and a woman
[1:51:02] that would say that is our lord up there
[1:51:08] now now don't put the brakes on me let
[1:51:10] me preach this okay
[1:51:11] in matthew 21 you realize what kind of
[1:51:14] day it was
[1:51:17] you know what kind of day it was it was
[1:51:19] a weary it was a nervous
[1:51:21] and an unusual day for the people were
[1:51:24] preparing
[1:51:25] for the passover amen this was jesus
[1:51:28] final visit
[1:51:31] oh god brother matt think about all the
[1:51:36] times
[1:51:37] that jesus had come into that part of
[1:51:39] town but this was a different time
[1:51:41] amen this was his final visit are you
[1:51:44] ready
[1:51:44] the next was his death
[1:51:49] are you hearing me and he knew
[1:51:50] everything that was before him
[1:51:52] so what does jesus do the prophet said
[1:51:55] how many can raise in and say thank god
[1:51:57] for a prophet
[1:51:59] thank god for elijah who could go back
[1:52:02] and could
[1:52:03] accurately describe the scene to where
[1:52:06] you
[1:52:06] actually felt like you were sitting
[1:52:08] there brother harvey watching it unfold
[1:52:10] before your very eyes
[1:52:14] he says jesus is standing on the
[1:52:17] mountain
[1:52:18] looking over jerusalem
[1:52:21] now do you realize what there was in
[1:52:22] that day there was a religious class of
[1:52:25] people
[1:52:26] that the prophet said they actually
[1:52:28] hated jesus
[1:52:30] but but in the middle of all that are
[1:52:32] you ready brother matt
[1:52:34] there was some non-seed down there that
[1:52:36] had not been quickened
[1:52:38] that hated jesus but there was some seed
[1:52:44] was some seed down there that was
[1:52:46] quickened
[1:52:47] amen and they loved his appearing the
[1:52:50] prophet said in the midst of all that
[1:52:52] through every age and every prophet that
[1:52:54] has ever been or would be
[1:52:55] there is going to be are you ready
[1:52:57] somebody said there is going to be
[1:53:00] say it was some attitude a certain
[1:53:03] amount of people
[1:53:05] that's predestinated to hear
[1:53:08] that message are you ready for this they
[1:53:12] won't just hear it brother joel
[1:53:14] they'll follow it
[1:53:17] [Applause]
[1:53:18] it just won't make him shout it'll make
[1:53:21] him give
[1:53:21] everything they've got to it there will
[1:53:24] be a bride
[1:53:25] on the earth that will hear the message
[1:53:27] she'll believe the message
[1:53:29] and she'll follow the message
[1:53:32] now are you ready what they'll do can i
[1:53:35] tell you what that little predestinated
[1:53:36] group will do
[1:53:37] he said they'll ignore the crowds
[1:53:41] now don't don't take that amen and try
[1:53:44] to turn that quote
[1:53:45] and say well ignore all the big groups
[1:53:47] no they'll ignore the crowds
[1:53:49] they'll ignore the criticism of the
[1:53:51] unbeliever
[1:53:52] they'll have no argument with him
[1:53:55] they've got one thing to do
[1:53:57] and that is belief
[1:53:59] [Music]
[1:54:01] oh somebody give god some praise in the
[1:54:04] house of god
[1:54:05] they'll ignore the crowds they'll ignore
[1:54:08] the criticism
[1:54:09] they'll ignore the voice of the critics
[1:54:12] because they've got one job to do
[1:54:14] that is to worship and to believe on
[1:54:17] he whom god has sent
[1:54:23] preacher what are you saying i'll make
[1:54:25] it as plain as i can
[1:54:26] i'm not concerned about what others are
[1:54:29] doing i've got one job to do

[1:54:46] and this voice saying go that way and
[1:54:48] this voice saying preach this and we'll
[1:54:50] back you to no
[1:54:51] end amen but i met god on the sacred
[1:54:54] sands
[1:54:55] and he commissioned me he meant to do
[1:54:57] one thing and that is preach
[1:54:59] this message and as long as andrew
[1:55:02] glover
[1:55:03] has got breath in his lungs and
[1:55:05] strengthen his bones
[1:55:06] i'll do everything i can to preach this

[1:55:16] of the resurrection out of them
[1:55:23] i'm not a crazy man i'm committed to
[1:55:25] believe this message
[1:55:27] there was a seed in me that was
[1:55:29] quickened to preach this message
[1:55:31] to believe this message to live this
[1:55:34] message to follow this message
[1:55:37] thank you jesus now now i just tell you
[1:55:40] this
[1:55:41] sometimes people get a little bit
[1:55:42] bothered at you and they say why are you
[1:55:44] doing certain things
[1:55:46] and why are you why are you going
[1:55:47] certain places and why are you preaching
[1:55:49] certain amen can i can i tell you why
[1:55:52] man called me one time he said now i
[1:55:54] want to know why you're preaching so and
[1:55:56] so places
[1:55:56] while you're going there and why you're
[1:55:58] doing this i said okay i got one
[1:56:00] question for you brother
[1:56:01] you tell me one thing that them people's
[1:56:03] done that disqualified them from hearing
[1:56:06] the gospel
[1:56:09] you tell me one thing they've done that
[1:56:11] disqualifies them
[1:56:12] at a chance of hearing the gospel i said
[1:56:15] until you come up with an
[1:56:16] exqualification
[1:56:17] that disqualifies me amen from preaching
[1:56:20] the gospel
[1:56:21] every time i get a chance in that pulpit
[1:56:23] i'll preach the gospel
[1:56:25] [Music]
[1:56:26] well i'll bump something there but i'll
[1:56:28] bump right through it this ain't a bunch
[1:56:30] of politics
[1:56:31] and a bunch of who's going where and
[1:56:33] who's preaching this is about somebody
[1:56:35] they've been hearing the gospel and the
[1:56:38] resurrection of the jesus christ
[1:56:40] that loves them and died for them and
[1:56:43] cares for them
[1:56:49] and as long as there's a door open i'll
[1:56:51] preach this message
[1:56:58] and as long as the church is open you
[1:57:00] ought to be back in this message
[1:57:08] hope this is okay he told me to take my
[1:57:10] liberty
[1:57:12] i'm done playing games it's this message
[1:57:16] or it's nothing
[1:57:17] either we're going to forget about
[1:57:18] what's going on here and there and
[1:57:20] preach this message or we might as well
[1:57:22] be at the coffee shop drinking coffee
[1:57:24] tonight this is not a church house
[1:57:27] it's just not a playhouse this is god's
[1:57:30] house
[1:57:30] [Applause]
[1:57:32] this is a place where seeds are
[1:57:35] quickened
[1:57:37] this is the place now now now you've got
[1:57:39] to realize
[1:57:40] amen that that criticism and those
[1:57:42] unbelievers were distractions
[1:57:49] you know now this is real deep okay are
[1:57:52] you ready for it
[1:57:55] the opposite of an attraction is a
[1:57:58] distraction
[1:58:02] i thought that went up all of my own
[1:58:08] the opposite of an attraction is a
[1:58:10] distraction
[1:58:12] see in luke 10 the bible talks about
[1:58:14] mary and martha
[1:58:15] and the 40th verse it says but martha
[1:58:17] was cumbered
[1:58:20] she was cumbered about much servant and
[1:58:23] she came to him
[1:58:24] and said lord does thou not care that my
[1:58:27] siste left me to serve alone
[1:58:29] been her therefore to help me now notice
[1:58:31] what martha was doing
[1:58:32] martha was serving but she was
[1:58:34] distracted
[1:58:41] she was serving but she was distracted
[1:58:45] you know what that word comfort means
[1:58:46] brother josh it means to draw away
[1:58:49] it means to be driven about mentally
[1:58:54] now i don't i don't have much time amen
[1:58:57] to stop here we'll get bogged down okay
[1:58:59] but let me just let you in a little
[1:59:00] secret it's actually a message called
[1:59:02] the present stage of my ministry
[1:59:04] that a prophet begins to talk about
[1:59:05] complexes
[1:59:07] and in there he says i built the
[1:59:10] complexes
[1:59:14] if you heard that if you heard that i'm
[1:59:17] not making that up am i
[1:59:18] i built the complexes see the devil
[1:59:22] supplied the bricks
[1:59:23] but brother branham did the building and
[1:59:26] he said the whole time
[1:59:28] here i was preaching and serving amen
[1:59:31] and i let god's sick children lay
[1:59:34] amen because of a complex
[1:59:38] so there can be people who are full of a
[1:59:40] complex
[1:59:41] and still be servant and not be serving
[1:59:44] in the perfect will of god
[1:59:46] now let me just take some liberty here
[1:59:48] amen amen just because you're serving
[1:59:51] don't mean you're actually serving the
[1:59:52] attraction sometimes
[1:59:54] you can be serving a distraction to the
[1:59:57] attraction
[2:00:00] oh is that okay are you hearing me it's
[2:00:04] not that brother man wasn't serving
[2:00:05] he was working under a complex i don't
[2:00:09] come on well for
[2:00:12] he said it about himself
[2:00:18] it means to be busy about a thing notice
[2:00:21] this
[2:00:21] and the prophet says there are so many
[2:00:24] emotions
[2:00:25] and thanks to distract us from the
[2:00:28] spirit today
[2:00:30] paul is actually going to come along and
[2:00:33] he's going to say
[2:00:34] brother harvey this i speak for your own
[2:00:37] prophet
[2:00:38] not that i may cast a snare upon you but
[2:00:40] for that which is comely
[2:00:42] are you ready and that you may attend
[2:00:45] upon the lord without distraction
[2:00:50] brother braden to think that a prophet
[2:00:53] of god is going to pick this up
[2:00:55] and say so many are distracted by the
[2:00:58] emotions
[2:01:03] and the spirit of today now watch this
[2:01:06] that word attend
[2:01:07] means to sit constantly by and to be
[2:01:10] devoted to
[2:01:11] to be distracted without distraction
