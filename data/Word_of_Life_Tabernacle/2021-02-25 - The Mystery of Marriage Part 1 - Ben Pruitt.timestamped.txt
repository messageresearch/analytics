[42:54] 7th genesis chapter 2 and verse
[42:58] 8 and the lord god planted a garden
[42:59] eastward in eden
[43:01] and there he put the man whom he had
[43:03] formed
[43:04] out of the ground made the lord god to
[43:06] grow every tree that is pleasant to the
[43:08] sight and good for food
[43:09] and the tree of life also in the midst
[43:11] of the garden and the tree of knowledge
[43:13] of good and evil
[43:14] and the river went out of eden to water
[43:16] the garden from thence it was parted and
[43:17] became into four heads the name of the
[43:19] first is
[43:20] paisan that is it which compasses the
[43:22] whole land of favala where there is gold
[43:25] the gold of that land is good there's
[43:26] bedellium in the onyx stone and the name
[43:28] of the second river is gaijon
[43:30] the same as it that compasses the whole
[43:32] land of ethiopia
[43:33] the name of the third river is hedekal
[43:35] that is it which goes toward the east of
[43:37] assyria
[43:38] the fourth river is euphrates and the
[43:41] lord god took the man and put him into
[43:43] the garden of eden to dress it
[43:45] and to keep it and the lord god
[43:48] commanded the man saying of every tree
[43:50] of the garden thou mayest freely eat
[43:53] but of the tree of the knowledge of good
[43:55] and evil thou shall not eat of it
[43:57] for in the day that thou eatest thereof
[43:58] thou shalt surely die
[44:00] and the lord god said it is not good
[44:02] that the man should be alone
[44:04] i will make him and help meet for him
[44:07] and out of the ground the lord god
[44:09] formed every beast to the field and
[44:10] every fowl of the air
[44:12] brought them unto adam to see what he
[44:14] would call them and whatsoever adam
[44:15] called every living creature that was
[44:17] the name thereof
[44:18] adam gave names to all cattle to the
[44:20] fowl of the air to every beast
[44:22] of the field but for adam there was not
[44:24] found a help meet for him
[44:26] the lord god caused a deep sleep to fall
[44:28] upon adam and he slept and he took one
[44:30] of his ribs
[44:31] closed up the flesh instead thereof in
[44:33] the rib once
[44:34] the lord god had taken from man made he
[44:36] a woman and
[44:38] brought her unto the man and adam said
[44:39] this is now bone of my bones
[44:41] and the flesh of my flesh she shall be
[44:43] called woman because she was taken out
[44:45] of man
[44:46] therefore shall a man leave his father
[44:48] and his mother and shall cleveland to
[44:49] his wife
[44:50] there shall be one flesh and they were
[44:52] both naked the man and his wife
[44:54] they were not ashamed i'll let you be
[44:56] seated there god bless you
[44:58] as you're seated
[45:03] kind of a long text for me but i want to
[45:05] read from ephesians 5 31 and 32 as well
[45:09] it repeats this it says for this cause
[45:11] shall a man leave his father and mother
[45:13] and shall be joined unto his wife and
[45:15] they too shall be one flesh
[45:17] he says this is a great mystery but i
[45:20] speak concerning christ
[45:22] and the church it's good to see each one
[45:25] of you here tonight good to have
[45:27] alan's with us tonight and and i see a
[45:30] a man here at the back thank you for for
[45:32] visiting with us tonight
[45:34] pray the lord would bless you there's
[45:37] something about natural beauty and
[45:39] romance that go together
[45:41] and i know immediately some of you are
[45:43] going to wonder where i'm going tonight
[45:45] but i want us to
[45:46] think deeply about this and spiritually
[45:51] but i want to talk to you about the
[45:53] mystery of marriage and
[45:56] what marriage looked like in paradise
[46:00] because paul said is a great mystery but
[46:03] he said i speak concerning christ in the
[46:05] church
[46:06] and there's something about paradise and
[46:09] romance that go together you know when
[46:10] you go
[46:11] on a trip for a honeymoon or a vacation
[46:13] you don't look for the ugliest spot you
[46:15] can find
[46:17] at least most of us don't you look for
[46:20] the most beautiful spot that you can
[46:21] find
[46:23] right you you don't look for the the
[46:26] dump
[46:26] down there somewhere and and it's all
[46:28] just any any place of work but
[46:31] you want a beautiful spot because
[46:33] there's something about that you want to
[46:35] find
[46:35] a paradise that you can go to and
[46:39] yeah all of those places have their
[46:41] problems
[46:43] a paradise can be imperfect
[46:46] and it really depends on who's there
[46:48] with you
[46:50] right it's more about the person than it
[46:53] is about the place yet it doesn't hurt
[46:56] to have a nice place
[46:59] right now but it's a paradise because
[47:02] love is there i
[47:04] remember if you'll forgive me for just a
[47:06] moment of going back a few years
[47:08] it's not been that many years but when
[47:09] we got married my wife and i
[47:11] my co-workers where i worked there in
[47:14] alton missouri decided they were going
[47:15] to go together and
[47:16] and help us pay for our honeymoon and so
[47:19] they scheduled a place
[47:20] and one of my co-workers had went to a
[47:23] place 30 years before
[47:25] on her honeymoon and she said well if
[47:28] it's good enough for us it'd be good
[47:29] enough for them and
[47:31] she remembered that being a paradise
[47:34] when we went there to i believe it was
[47:36] called the fox fire resort
[47:38] in branson we went there and for three
[47:42] or four days and
[47:43] it wasn't much of a paradise
[47:46] the carpet was old and the furnishings
[47:49] were outdated and
[47:50] they probably hadn't changed anything in
[47:52] that 30 years
[47:55] but my wife here not long ago we were
[47:57] there in that area and she said
[47:59] she'd like to go back there again well
[48:01] it doesn't have anything to do with the
[48:03] place that it was it was just that
[48:06] we had love there and when love is there
[48:10] it's paradise you might think that about
[48:13] your home
[48:14] i think about the story brother branham
[48:16] told about the black man that was a
[48:18] slave and he'd been released from
[48:20] slavery to go preach the gospel and he
[48:22] goes out and
[48:22] preaches all of his life and then at the
[48:24] end of his life his brethren come in
[48:26] around him and
[48:27] and they said brother sam says
[48:30] here at the end you're nearing the end
[48:32] so pretty soon you're going to get your
[48:34] robin crown
[48:35] he said don't tell me about no robin
[48:37] crown
[48:39] and he said this he said i just want to
[48:42] look at him
[48:43] for a thousand years
[48:46] just want to look at him don't tell me
[48:49] about paradise
[48:50] let me look at him for a thousand years
[48:54] oh that's the way i feel about him
[48:55] tonight is that how you feel
[48:57] i just want to look at him i i just want
[49:00] to be in his presence if i can just be
[49:02] in his presence
[49:04] it's all that matters
[49:08] the first eden was a paradise god didn't
[49:10] put his his children just anywhere
[49:13] he put him in a beautiful place in fact
[49:16] the word eden means
[49:18] pleasure verse 8 says the lord god
[49:20] planted a garden eastward in eden
[49:23] and there he put the man on whom he had
[49:24] formed that means pleasure
[49:27] it's a beautiful place their purpose was
[49:30] not pleasure but god put them in a place
[49:33] of pleasure a place where they could
[49:35] they would be happy
[49:37] there and there is happiness in family
[49:40] life
[49:42] but their purpose was to be god's family
[49:44] on the earth now
[49:45] uh in the greek translation of the new
[49:48] testament
[49:49] it says it this way it says god planted
[49:51] a paradise in eden
[49:53] so it says he put a garden in eden that
[49:56] word garden is paradise
[49:58] he put a garden in eden and
[50:01] that word paradise then was introduced
[50:03] in the new testament is generally used
[50:05] to signify a place of
[50:06] exquisite pleasure and delight the word
[50:10] also means an enclosed garden so it's
[50:13] not just a garden but it's a garden with
[50:14] walls
[50:16] a garden that is meant to be
[50:19] all by itself and off to itself and they
[50:22] were meant to stay there
[50:24] not to go outside the boundaries of it
[50:27] it had
[50:28] specific boundaries and as long as they
[50:30] stayed within those boundaries life was
[50:33] beautiful
[50:35] and you can see a correlation to
[50:36] marriage there
[50:40] but adam was unhappy when he first was
[50:42] in paradise
[50:44] because nothing had been created to
[50:46] correspond with him
[50:49] nothing had been created to complement
[50:50] him and who he was
[50:52] and the lord god said in verse 18 that
[50:54] it's not good that the man should be
[50:56] alone
[50:57] remember he had said it's good it's good
[50:58] it's good and he says it's not good
[51:01] right he looked at everything he made he
[51:02] said it's good but it's not good the
[51:04] condition that man is in
[51:06] he said i will make him a help meet for
[51:08] him
[51:09] in the amplified version it says now the
[51:11] lord god said that it's not
[51:12] beneficial for the man to be alone i
[51:15] will make him a helper one who balances
[51:17] him
[51:17] a counterpart who is suitable and
[51:19] complementary for him
[51:23] brother branham put it like this and i
[51:25] just kind of want to draw our minds to
[51:27] some of the things that brother branham
[51:28] said about
[51:29] this place where they had the first
[51:31] marriage
[51:34] and he put it like this he said as he
[51:36] walked through the garden of eden
[51:38] first as a theophany like the holy
[51:40] spirit he says
[51:41] is in here now walking in here
[51:45] and so adam walked like that at first
[51:48] he said it led the animal life it
[51:50] controlled everything
[51:52] but it couldn't till the soil so god put
[51:55] him in flesh
[51:56] so he could till the soil to take care
[51:59] of the garden
[52:01] he said give him his five senses to till
[52:04] the soil
[52:04] fix up the vineyards and so forth and
[52:06] then the man still looked lonesome
[52:09] he said oh this is a beautiful picture
[52:12] he said look for when he was
[52:14] first made he was made two people
[52:17] together
[52:18] he was made both male and female the man
[52:21] was
[52:22] the bible said he was god made men both
[52:24] male and female created he
[52:25] him and he said notice now when man was
[52:28] separated from the theophany and put in
[52:29] flesh
[52:31] now watch this because it's kind of
[52:32] tricky he said he wasn't just
[52:34] all together there part of his being
[52:38] was still a theophany so it didn't look
[52:41] right
[52:43] now that takes some thinking through but
[52:45] just think about it for a moment
[52:47] adam had been expressed but there was a
[52:48] part of that theophany that had not been
[52:51] expressed
[52:52] right and that part was eve
[52:57] so he couldn't stay alone she had to be
[53:00] expressed
[53:01] but it couldn't be something different
[53:02] from him are you with me now
[53:05] don't you see why jesus had to die on a
[53:07] cross had to be buried had to raise
[53:09] again
[53:09] because he couldn't remain like that it
[53:11] was a part of that that had not been
[53:13] expressed and so
[53:14] here there was a part of that theophany
[53:16] that had not been expressed
[53:18] and so he said it didn't look right
[53:21] he said and and there went the male and
[53:23] female in the cow
[53:25] there went the horse there went the ox
[53:26] there when everything else
[53:28] pairs but adam something he said was
[53:32] lacking the very crave
[53:35] showed that there was a mate waiting for
[53:37] him
[53:39] and what's amazing about this is because
[53:41] many times we look at what brother
[53:42] branham said about the woman i'm going
[53:44] to try to stay behind here tonight and
[53:45] just talk to you but
[53:46] it's hard but when we look at what
[53:49] brother branham said about the woman
[53:51] we look at her and i'll read a quote
[53:53] about that but the random calls are a
[53:55] byproduct
[53:56] of the man and many times we look at
[53:58] that as saying well she's just a
[54:00] byproduct as if that's a bad thing
[54:03] but it just means she come from him
[54:06] right and and so it's not the
[54:08] she's not just the byproduct of the man
[54:10] but it's a part of him and
[54:12] and we look at that and think but there
[54:14] was something there the craze that he
[54:16] had
[54:16] showed that there was a mate waiting
[54:20] for him there had to be something that
[54:22] would be expressed
[54:24] more than there already was it had to
[54:26] happen and the fact
[54:27] is that when we get beyond
[54:31] the millennium when we go into eternity
[54:33] back into eternity
[54:35] we don't go back into christ
[54:39] he keeps us separate does that make
[54:41] sense
[54:42] god's perfect idea of a family
[54:46] was a man and a woman each expressing
[54:49] their individual
[54:50] characteristic
[54:54] that's why it's so terrible what man is
[54:55] doing today because they're
[54:57] they're mixing the two and and causing
[55:00] it to be a
[55:01] uh just it doesn't matter you can be
[55:03] whatever you want to be no you are what
[55:05] god made you
[55:06] and he made you that for a reason
[55:09] to express something out of himself and
[55:12] so
[55:13] there was a crave inside of him he
[55:14] wasn't he didn't need to be alone
[55:17] he wasn't right being alone there had to
[55:19] be a further expression of who he was
[55:23] but the brahmana says you get it he said
[55:25] in the very thoughts
[55:26] we have that we have to die here he said
[55:29] that we're troubled and perplexed
[55:32] we long for a life that has no death it
[55:35] shows
[55:35] it's waiting for us what's waiting for
[55:38] us heaven is waiting for us
[55:40] the very fact that we that we long for
[55:42] heaven shows us there's a heaven there
[55:47] he said adam was lonesome and
[55:50] odd to show that they could not be
[55:52] separated he said no i'm going to go get
[55:54] back to the same thing just a second
[55:56] he said look he never went and got dirt
[55:58] and made it eve
[56:00] amen but he made from the original dirt
[56:05] hallelujah so you can't have anything
[56:07] outside of the word
[56:09] right it always has to come from the
[56:10] original the bride can't be something
[56:12] different from the groom
[56:15] right it can't be something different
[56:17] it's got to come from the original
[56:19] because he couldn't go get other dirt he
[56:20] went and got the original dirt
[56:22] a man annie adam and he took a rib from
[56:25] his side made him a help mate and that
[56:27] was eve
[56:28] she was made for the man and
[56:31] part of the man pretty bad
[56:35] just think about that actually now what
[56:38] she was part of him in the beginning
[56:40] in the creation in a theophany she was
[56:43] part of him
[56:45] it isn't as if god you know we look at
[56:47] it as if god
[56:48] messed up by just making adam and said
[56:50] wait a minute i better make you eve to
[56:52] go along with him
[56:53] that wasn't it at all it was always the
[56:56] plan but it couldn't
[56:59] be from a different creation
[57:02] it had to come from that creation
[57:05] amen and she was part of him in the
[57:08] beginning in the creation of theophany
[57:09] she was part of him
[57:10] down here in this creation she could not
[57:13] be divided in another creation
[57:15] she had to be made in the same creation
[57:19] right does that make sense and that kind
[57:20] of when we talk about
[57:23] a help mate when we talk about somebody
[57:25] as if well she's just a byproduct no
[57:28] she's part of him she was part of him
[57:31] amen
[57:33] and so he says she was part of him down
[57:35] here in this creation she could not be
[57:36] divided in another creation
[57:38] he said that's exactly why christ and
[57:39] god now watch this
[57:42] christ and god had to be the very same
[57:43] person
[57:45] could not be anything different couldn't
[57:48] be two people
[57:52] it come from the same theory if we could
[57:55] put it that way
[57:57] right you can't make christ and god two
[57:58] different lineage of two different
[58:00] people
[58:01] god had to have a family and in order to
[58:03] have that family it had to be all him
[58:06] so he created adam and then he created
[58:07] eve out of adam
[58:09] it couldn't be adam and the knee from
[58:11] somewhere else
[58:13] and that's why adam couldn't go marry
[58:15] somebody else
[58:17] number one there was nobody else right
[58:20] one very many other options in eden
[58:22] right
[58:24] huh but he couldn't have put her away
[58:26] and and divorced her and married another
[58:30] why because she was part of him
[58:33] no matter what she did he had to go out
[58:35] with her she was part of him
[58:38] very bad hallelujah
[58:42] but it shows that there has to be a
[58:43] bride that won't fall because we don't
[58:46] fall and then he comes out after us no
[58:47] he comes after us and then we come into
[58:49] him
[58:50] we're going the right direction does
[58:51] that make sense there's got to be an end
[58:53] time bride that won't fall that will be
[58:55] a part of him flesh of his flesh
[58:56] bone of his bone power of his power
[59:01] and that's why he said christ and god
[59:03] had to be the very same person could not
[59:04] be anything different
[59:05] if he had been a good man or a prophet
[59:07] he wouldn't have been a redeemer
[59:09] he had to be the creator himself he said
[59:12] but he's still at theophany now you see
[59:13] and he said the way he was then now
[59:16] look at the paradise they had everything
[59:19] there was good and pleasant
[59:22] everything well we could dwell on that
[59:25] for a while
[59:26] because like i said no matter how good
[59:27] you have it if you go to the caribbean
[59:30] or
[59:30] caribbean or however you say it if you
[59:33] go down there
[59:36] you're going to find a place that's
[59:37] imperfect less than perfect
[59:40] right and people send back pictures of
[59:43] the beautiful sand and the sea and you
[59:44] don't see the thumbs behind
[59:46] them right and it's just like around
[59:49] here you know i can see it make some
[59:50] beautiful pictures of the river and
[59:52] you don't see the trash up on the bank
[59:54] and it's not everywhere but there's
[59:55] always a downside
[59:57] they lived in a place with no downside
[1:00:01] they didn't lived in a place that was
[1:00:02] all good
[1:00:04] and this is why when it comes to
[1:00:06] marriage you can't blame
[1:00:09] your surroundings for what's going on in
[1:00:13] a marriage
[1:00:15] because if the surroundings were perfect
[1:00:18] that marriage should have lasted forever
[1:00:21] but it didn't the first marriage was
[1:00:24] also the first broken marriage
[1:00:28] but i want to talk about this god put
[1:00:30] them in a paradise for a reason
[1:00:33] and everything was good but there was an
[1:00:34] opportunity there even in that paradise
[1:00:37] for evil
[1:00:38] because there was a tree of knowledge of
[1:00:39] good and evil now brother branham says
[1:00:42] this he said now i want you to notice as
[1:00:43] we're moving on the holy spirit after
[1:00:45] brooding into man
[1:00:46] man came up he said what a beautiful
[1:00:48] thing he was
[1:00:49] you wouldn't say that about many men
[1:00:51] today but he said what a beautiful thing
[1:00:53] he was
[1:00:54] god thought so god said it was good
[1:00:57] he said and then god made the woman he
[1:00:59] said no she was not in the original
[1:01:01] creation
[1:01:02] she's a byproduct of a man he said i
[1:01:04] want to get started on that but she is a
[1:01:05] byproduct of man
[1:01:07] then when she come into existence and
[1:01:09] she was the prettiest woman in all the
[1:01:11] world little eve
[1:01:13] that's saying a lot of course there was
[1:01:15] only one
[1:01:17] but she was the prettiest woman in all
[1:01:18] the world
[1:01:20] i tell my wife you're the prettiest wife
[1:01:22] i've ever had
[1:01:25] prettiest woman in all the world i
[1:01:28] believe he said i could see her long
[1:01:30] hair hanging down
[1:01:31] he said let's say for sake right now it
[1:01:33] was blonde he said she had her eyes as
[1:01:35] blue as the sky
[1:01:37] and her sparkle was like the stars
[1:01:41] what a sweetheart adam had he said not
[1:01:44] vulgarity not even in the picture
[1:01:47] she walked with adam and they come to
[1:01:48] where the waters was and she'd say
[1:01:50] oh adam that wind said peace
[1:01:54] and the wind ceased well it must have
[1:01:56] made him feel like a man
[1:01:57] you know peace
[1:02:02] a little bit harder for us isn't it
[1:02:06] you walk in your house you need to try
[1:02:07] that next time you come home and there's
[1:02:09] winds and waves you know what i'm
[1:02:10] talking about and you say peace
[1:02:15] the wind ceased and then she went
[1:02:18] through and went on through in the great
[1:02:20] line let out a roar eve could not be
[1:02:22] afraid
[1:02:23] there's nothing in here to make her
[1:02:24] afraid i love that
[1:02:28] where does fear come from from the
[1:02:29] outside there's no fear in love
[1:02:32] amen perfect love cast out fear now he
[1:02:35] said there's nothing in her to make her
[1:02:36] afraid she said dear what is that
[1:02:38] he called the lion over and said come
[1:02:40] here he patted him on the head and he
[1:02:41] meowed like a kitten
[1:02:43] what behind him is a little dog would
[1:02:45] follow you from your house here comes
[1:02:48] sheet of the tiger he talked to the
[1:02:49] cheetah he began to speak with her
[1:02:52] she followed along but you know it began
[1:02:55] to get evening time the sun was setting
[1:02:57] he said sweetheart
[1:02:58] we must go up to the cathedral you say
[1:03:01] well
[1:03:01] when did this church thing start why do
[1:03:03] we why do we have church
[1:03:04] from the very beginning
[1:03:08] they went up to the cathedral he said
[1:03:10] we've got to worship it wasn't a
[1:03:12] denomination
[1:03:13] it was in a great big forest and they
[1:03:15] went up and knelt down as the sun was
[1:03:17] going down
[1:03:18] and the father came down amen
[1:03:21] i believe he still does that today the
[1:03:24] lightnings flashed the thunders roared
[1:03:26] and a beautiful majestic light sailed
[1:03:29] over the bushes
[1:03:30] and it come down can you hear the loving
[1:03:33] voice of the father say
[1:03:34] children have you enjoyed yourself today
[1:03:38] papa has come down to kiss you good
[1:03:40] night lay you down for the night
[1:03:43] a kiss upon the cheek of adam and a kiss
[1:03:46] upon the cheek
[1:03:47] of eve
[1:03:51] was such a beautiful thing they didn't
[1:03:54] have to be forgiven they'd never done
[1:03:56] anything wrong
[1:04:00] they didn't have any to wrestle with any
[1:04:02] thoughts or
[1:04:03] anything that had happened in the past
[1:04:06] i know that keeps a lot of people from
[1:04:08] worship you imagine what kind of worship
[1:04:09] this was
[1:04:11] they didn't have to deal with any of
[1:04:12] that amen
[1:04:15] we've got something even greater than
[1:04:16] that because we've been redeemed
[1:04:23] but he said father he said they went to
[1:04:26] he said he lays his big arm out and she
[1:04:28] lays her head little danny head upon his
[1:04:30] arm as a pillow
[1:04:31] he went to sleep and perfect nothing can
[1:04:34] bother them fathers watching over them
[1:04:36] there's nothing in the earth to harm
[1:04:38] them leo the lion lays there sheet of
[1:04:40] the tiger lays there he laid them all
[1:04:41] down father
[1:04:43] he said if that isn't wonderful and then
[1:04:46] sin
[1:04:47] came in and spoiled the picture
[1:04:50] he said but we were here god's purpose
[1:04:54] has to be carried out
[1:04:57] you see marriage was designed to be
[1:04:59] paradise
[1:05:01] eden perfect
[1:05:05] marriage can be a wonderful place
[1:05:09] it's not meant to be a place of
[1:05:10] controversy not a bondage
[1:05:12] we hear a lot of jokes about that and
[1:05:15] and
[1:05:16] we i probably contributed to that a
[1:05:20] little bit myself
[1:05:21] sometimes we i think we talk even
[1:05:23] jokingly too negatively about marriage
[1:05:26] because our kids hear us and i think why
[1:05:27] would i ever want to be married
[1:05:30] but the truth is marriage can be good
[1:05:33] and i've wanted so many times
[1:05:35] for people that are unmarried and
[1:05:37] younger people coming up to have
[1:05:38] what i have as hard as it is sometimes
[1:05:42] i want them to have what i have i want
[1:05:44] them to be able to experience that i
[1:05:46] want them to be able
[1:05:47] to know what it's like to love somebody
[1:05:48] through thick and thin through
[1:05:50] everything that goes on
[1:05:51] and to have a moment of paradise with
[1:05:54] that person even when you don't have
[1:05:56] anything
[1:05:57] even when there's nothing else going
[1:05:58] right you still have your place of
[1:06:00] a perfection your place of paradise with
[1:06:03] that person
[1:06:05] now think of that spiritually as well
[1:06:08] when everything else goes wrong
[1:06:10] you still have jesus amen
[1:06:13] and he said i'll be a father to the
[1:06:15] fatherless
[1:06:16] amen amen now
[1:06:20] within the boundaries of eden of this
[1:06:23] marriage
[1:06:24] that god has has given us
[1:06:27] are the greatest pleasures of life
[1:06:32] if those boundaries are crossed the
[1:06:33] greatest evil in life
[1:06:36] marriage is paradise when love rules
[1:06:41] and we don't have to say what it is when
[1:06:44] there's hate
[1:06:47] brother brown says how sweet it must
[1:06:48] have been to have seen adam and eve in
[1:06:50] that love affair
[1:06:52] walking through the garden
[1:06:56] before there was any kind of carnal
[1:06:58] relationship there was love
[1:07:00] you know and love makes the paradise
[1:07:02] last
[1:07:04] right because the the body's going to
[1:07:08] break down we're not in perfect bodies
[1:07:10] like they were
[1:07:11] it's going to break down it's going to
[1:07:13] fall apart we're going to get fat
[1:07:16] well some of you all won't but i did
[1:07:21] but stuart you must have been meant to
[1:07:23] hear this i know allison didn't need it
[1:07:24] so
[1:07:27] but you know we're going to get to where
[1:07:29] it's hard
[1:07:31] on the physical side to have that same
[1:07:34] level of attraction
[1:07:36] but if there's love there it'll make the
[1:07:38] paradise last
[1:07:40] because that's what it was based on in
[1:07:41] the beginning
[1:07:43] right and and we shouldn't look back and
[1:07:46] constantly look back down our life and
[1:07:48] say well if we could only have what we
[1:07:49] used to have
[1:07:50] no you got better love now than you did
[1:07:52] back then you just don't remember
[1:07:54] right if you're really in love with one
[1:07:56] another
[1:07:57] your love is greater now than what it
[1:07:59] was then
[1:08:01] i wouldn't want to be dating or engaged
[1:08:03] again
[1:08:04] i don't want to be courting again i i've
[1:08:07] got the real thing
[1:08:10] right and i think those of us who we we
[1:08:13] should recognize that
[1:08:14] we have something that's great and
[1:08:16] something that that can be
[1:08:17] a pleasure to us and and i think we
[1:08:20] ought to recognize that about god as
[1:08:21] well
[1:08:22] this isn't just us coming to church
[1:08:24] because we have to
[1:08:25] it's not because oh i'll do the dishes
[1:08:28] today because i know he'd get mad if i
[1:08:29] didn't do them
[1:08:30] oh i'll go to work today because i know
[1:08:31] she'd get mad if i didn't make any money
[1:08:33] no it's not that it's because you love
[1:08:35] her
[1:08:35] you love him amen and why do you serve
[1:08:39] god why do you come the house of god
[1:08:40] not because i made you do it god help us
[1:08:44] if we get to that place
[1:08:45] where it's because you're afraid i'll
[1:08:46] preach at you why do you serve god
[1:08:48] because
[1:08:49] god himself you're so in love with him i
[1:08:52] wouldn't want to not be around god's
[1:08:54] people because i know
[1:08:55] that god is there and i love him so much
[1:09:00] amen because i love him it makes me love
[1:09:02] you
[1:09:03] makes you love me many people brother
[1:09:06] branham tells us to ride a light road
[1:09:08] looking through a rear view mirror
[1:09:09] he said especially he said many of our
[1:09:12] women they're always when past about 30
[1:09:14] years old they want to go back and be a
[1:09:15] young girl again
[1:09:17] he said and get 50 they still want the
[1:09:19] same thing not only that but the men
[1:09:21] too anybody who looks through a rear
[1:09:24] view mirror is going to wreck up
[1:09:25] somewhere
[1:09:27] you can't drive the road looking through
[1:09:28] the rear view mirror
[1:09:30] you got to let go of your mistakes
[1:09:34] at some point you've got to forgive
[1:09:35] yourself and forgive everybody else too
[1:09:39] and i've dealt with this i've seen that
[1:09:41] just destroy people
[1:09:43] where they can't get over how they were
[1:09:44] raised they can't get over how they
[1:09:46] come up they can't get over a certain
[1:09:48] pastor or a certain preacher a certain
[1:09:49] thing
[1:09:50] and it just eats at them and eats at
[1:09:51] them and eventually they leave church
[1:09:53] all together they
[1:09:54] completely take themselves away from god
[1:09:55] and you think why why would they do that
[1:09:57] it's not because they're
[1:09:58] not good people but they just couldn't
[1:10:00] get to that point where they could say i
[1:10:02] forgive you
[1:10:04] many people who mess up and you know
[1:10:06] that's all of us
[1:10:08] all of us mess up at some point or
[1:10:09] another but when you mess up you got to
[1:10:12] get back up
[1:10:15] brother brown said this he said i'd
[1:10:16] rather be on the battlefield making
[1:10:18] mistakes
[1:10:19] than to be criticizing someone else
[1:10:21] who's trying to win souls for christ
[1:10:25] at least if i'm making mistakes i got an
[1:10:27] eraser on my pencil
[1:10:28] at least it's there for a reason it's
[1:10:30] because i'm working
[1:10:32] right and so that ought to be the way we
[1:10:35] are in marriage as well
[1:10:36] and so he said you can't drive the road
[1:10:38] looking through the rear view mirror he
[1:10:39] said but i believe what paul said
[1:10:41] forgetting
[1:10:42] those things which are in the past i
[1:10:44] pressed toward the mark of the high
[1:10:46] calling in christ
[1:10:47] good and bad and indifferent i'm laying
[1:10:50] those are the past is passed
[1:10:52] the poet says this way he said today is
[1:10:54] the only living time
[1:10:57] all of the rest are either unborn or
[1:11:00] already dead
[1:11:03] this moment is the only living time
[1:11:07] so now brother branham says this way he
[1:11:10] said see don't look what you were look
[1:11:11] what you're going to be
[1:11:14] amen don't look what you were look what
[1:11:17] you're going to be
[1:11:18] i'm going to be in a new body i'm going
[1:11:20] to live for god
[1:11:22] i'm going to stand for truth i'm going
[1:11:24] to be a believer and i'm leaving here
[1:11:25] one of these days don't look at what you
[1:11:27] were
[1:11:27] look what you're going to be if
[1:11:30] something happens to you traumatic maybe
[1:11:32] in your body you get sick and you just
[1:11:34] can't seem to get over it but don't look
[1:11:35] at what you were
[1:11:36] what happened to you look what you're
[1:11:38] going to be one day i'm not going to be
[1:11:40] relying on a cane anymore one day i'm
[1:11:42] not going to i'm not going to be bound
[1:11:44] to this wheelchair one day i'm not going
[1:11:45] to be bound to these things
[1:11:47] i'm going to run again i'm going to walk
[1:11:48] again i'm going to be a young man or a
[1:11:50] young woman again
[1:11:52] look at what you were look what you're
[1:11:54] going to be
[1:11:56] brother random said i was remarrying an
[1:11:57] old couple one time they'd taken their
[1:11:59] vows over
[1:12:00] he said they were 83 and 84 years old
[1:12:02] apiece
[1:12:04] he said i'd give them the full vow he
[1:12:07] said i felt crazy
[1:12:08] he said just a young fellow as i was he
[1:12:10] said the old man had been married about
[1:12:11] 60 years him and his wife
[1:12:14] they were taking the vow and they were
[1:12:16] just as much
[1:12:17] in love as they ever was
[1:12:22] in in life i want that if the lord
[1:12:25] tarries
[1:12:26] i want to be married to my wife for 60
[1:12:28] years that's a goal of mine
[1:12:31] to be able to do that my hat's off to
[1:12:32] those of you who've done that
[1:12:34] that's a goal of mine but you know what
[1:12:37] i want more
[1:12:38] the second thing to be true be just as
[1:12:40] much in love as i ever was
[1:12:45] he said he had a long beard and i said
[1:12:47] to him i said to her i said what do you
[1:12:49] think about it and i asked him first i
[1:12:50] said what do you think about it
[1:12:52] why do you wear a long beard he said i
[1:12:54] think an old man my age should have a
[1:12:56] long beard
[1:12:57] so some of y'all if you have a long
[1:12:59] beard and you're old you have a message
[1:13:00] for it now
[1:13:02] i don't know where that leads brother
[1:13:03] caleb but
[1:13:08] i said to her what do you think about it
[1:13:09] she said well she said anything john
[1:13:11] does is just fine
[1:13:14] don't you want to be like that i love my
[1:13:17] grandma
[1:13:18] and grandpa on my dad's side they're
[1:13:19] both passed on now but
[1:13:22] they had a relationship where they were
[1:13:23] just always yelling at each other from
[1:13:24] the other room
[1:13:25] and he'd taken his his hearing aids out
[1:13:28] and turned up the tv where he couldn't
[1:13:30] hear
[1:13:30] and on purpose you know i don't want
[1:13:32] that kind of relationship
[1:13:34] it's funny looking back at it but i
[1:13:35] don't want to be like that
[1:13:37] i want to be just as much in love as i
[1:13:39] ever was
[1:13:41] and so i said well there's quite a
[1:13:43] difference quite a difference in you
[1:13:45] since you married her
[1:13:47] he said you know the lord has been good
[1:13:49] said she's just as pretty as she ever
[1:13:51] was
[1:13:52] but you know as she gets older my sight
[1:13:54] gets dimmer
[1:13:57] god made it that way you wouldn't want
[1:14:00] nothing else
[1:14:02] amen he said i thought that was really
[1:14:06] sweet he said i hope my wife thinks the
[1:14:07] same thing and i feel
[1:14:08] we all feel that way about it he said
[1:14:10] but they had found
[1:14:12] life they'd found how to live it
[1:14:15] that's the way to live it stay right in
[1:14:17] eden
[1:14:18] all right don't cross out of it it'll
[1:14:20] just bring you trouble stay right within
[1:14:22] the boundaries of that
[1:14:23] paradise that you found if you found it
[1:14:25] stay there
[1:14:27] don't leave it if you haven't found it
[1:14:32] there's a place to find it and it's not
[1:14:33] in some other person or some other thing
[1:14:35] it's in christ
[1:14:37] because if you find it in him you'll
[1:14:38] find it in in life as well
[1:14:41] now see this eden was subject though to
[1:14:43] their ability to make choices every day
[1:14:47] maybe they they had everything they
[1:14:49] could ever want
[1:14:51] but just making a choice to
[1:14:55] eat of the tree and we all know what
[1:14:57] that was
[1:14:58] of knowledge of good and evil would
[1:15:01] cause them
[1:15:02] to be taken out of the garden
[1:15:06] one choice
[1:15:09] so the evil was present
[1:15:12] in the garden now
[1:15:16] it's a choice that you make you make a
[1:15:18] choice to stay married every day
[1:15:21] because you're put on free moral agency
[1:15:24] you could conceivably although some of
[1:15:26] you may have a hard time getting down to
[1:15:28] the court by yourself
[1:15:31] but every one of us could conceivably
[1:15:33] file for divorce
[1:15:36] we could why don't you
[1:15:39] why don't you i understand things happen
[1:15:42] and
[1:15:43] life gets so mixed up because we live in
[1:15:44] this imperfect world but
[1:15:46] why don't you why don't you because
[1:15:49] you make a choice not to
[1:15:53] and so you choose not to do the things
[1:15:55] that are going to take you out of eden
[1:15:57] i know if i do that i'm going to be
[1:15:58] taken out of
[1:16:00] my paradise and because satan is in the
[1:16:04] business of dissatisfaction
[1:16:07] what he wants to do is make you
[1:16:08] dissatisfied with your current condition
[1:16:11] right that's what he does that's what he
[1:16:13] started doing he's an expert at it
[1:16:15] he comes into a perfect world and he
[1:16:18] comes in there
[1:16:19] and somehow makes eve feel like some of
[1:16:22] these teenagers feel today living in
[1:16:24] america
[1:16:24] well ain't got nothing huh
[1:16:27] these people burning down buildings and
[1:16:29] everything like that why do they do that
[1:16:31] because they feel like they don't have
[1:16:33] anything
[1:16:34] they've been made to feel like that
[1:16:36] they're the poorest most wretched people
[1:16:38] on the earth you think how can you feel
[1:16:39] that way
[1:16:40] you're looting even your looting shows
[1:16:42] you're not getting food you've already
[1:16:44] got food
[1:16:45] what are they looting big screen tvs
[1:16:50] why do they do that because they already
[1:16:51] have everything they could ever want
[1:16:54] and i don't say that lightly i know some
[1:16:56] people are poorer than others i've been
[1:16:58] poorer than most
[1:17:00] so i know what that's like but i know
[1:17:02] this in this country we have far more
[1:17:04] than any other generation in history has
[1:17:06] ever had
[1:17:08] if you live now in this country you're a
[1:17:10] blessed person
[1:17:11] but satan is in the business of making
[1:17:13] you dissatisfied
[1:17:16] that's his job that's what he wants to
[1:17:17] do and so he comes into eden and he
[1:17:19] begins to talk to eve
[1:17:21] and he says but you you aren't what you
[1:17:23] could be
[1:17:24] and you don't know what you could know
[1:17:27] and you haven't experienced what you
[1:17:29] could experience
[1:17:32] and so slowly he talks her into this
[1:17:35] state
[1:17:35] of being dissatisfied and then he offers
[1:17:39] her a solution
[1:17:41] you see the apostle paul says i've
[1:17:43] learned in whatever state i am
[1:17:45] there with to be content
[1:17:49] godliness with contentment is great gain
[1:17:51] there's something to be said
[1:17:53] about just being happy with who you have
[1:17:55] and where you are and where you live
[1:17:59] but you gotta you gotta work at that
[1:18:02] because the just the human condition is
[1:18:05] to respond listen she was hadn't even
[1:18:07] gone through the fall yet
[1:18:08] she wasn't dealing with a fallen nature
[1:18:11] and she still was dissatisfied
[1:18:14] why the devil worked in her mind to make
[1:18:18] her that way
[1:18:18] and that's the same thing the enemy does
[1:18:20] today and he does it through facebook he
[1:18:22] does it through the internet
[1:18:23] he does it through somebody you meet he
[1:18:25] does it in some other way where he tries
[1:18:26] to make you dissatisfied don't you
[1:18:28] realize he's doing that in the spiritual
[1:18:30] realm as well
[1:18:31] trying to make you dissatisfied with the
[1:18:32] message of the hour
[1:18:34] how could i be dissatisfied with what
[1:18:36] brings me life
[1:18:38] how can i be dissatisfied with the thing
[1:18:40] that's brought me here
[1:18:41] i don't have nothing else to preach
[1:18:44] you've been around me long enough now
[1:18:45] you've heard me preaching nothing i've
[1:18:46] got nothing else to preach with this
[1:18:48] message
[1:18:49] where would i be without this message i
[1:18:50] don't have anything else
[1:18:53] but satan will move in and try to make
[1:18:55] the people dissatisfied with a
[1:18:57] supernatural god look what he did to
[1:18:59] them
[1:18:59] when they come over from egypt and and
[1:19:01] they were eating manna
[1:19:03] and pretty soon they were so sick of it
[1:19:06] that they said there's nothing at all to
[1:19:07] eat
[1:19:08] but man
[1:19:11] they hated it they said our soul loves
[1:19:13] this light bread
[1:19:14] why it's satan's job to make people
[1:19:17] dissatisfied
[1:19:20] you do the same thing in church you're
[1:19:23] talking working
[1:19:24] all the time constantly trying to get
[1:19:25] you to be dissatisfied
[1:19:28] but you know where you should worship
[1:19:29] god you should worship god
[1:19:31] in the place where you are
[1:19:34] if it's in the car if it's at the church
[1:19:36] wherever it is you should worship god
[1:19:37] you say well you you do the very best
[1:19:40] you can god will open up better
[1:19:41] opportunities
[1:19:43] you know how to get a better job be the
[1:19:45] best employee you can be
[1:19:48] right my pastor always told me that and
[1:19:51] i always kind of graded at that but it's
[1:19:52] the truth
[1:19:54] you want to but i have you always told
[1:19:56] us this he said make your boss rich
[1:19:59] your job should be to make your boss
[1:20:01] rich
[1:20:02] i got to think about that what in the
[1:20:03] world does that mean well it means that
[1:20:05] you do your very best
[1:20:07] whether the boss is worthy of it or not
[1:20:10] right and in the end it'll make you so
[1:20:12] much better at what you do and
[1:20:14] what and people will notice that and
[1:20:15] you'll get promoted to something better
[1:20:17] plus god will honor it don't be
[1:20:20] dissatisfied sit there and gripe all the
[1:20:21] time you know the people who never
[1:20:23] go anywhere i found that out as a young
[1:20:25] man my dad excused me for digressing a
[1:20:27] little bit but
[1:20:28] my dad was an insurance salesman we'd go
[1:20:30] to the sales meetings with him and there
[1:20:31] were certain people there who always
[1:20:32] griped
[1:20:33] they were always agents who didn't sell
[1:20:35] anything
[1:20:37] every week they'd come and they'd gripe
[1:20:39] about the leads they got they'd grab
[1:20:40] out the thing and what my dad's boss
[1:20:42] would do is he would take those same
[1:20:44] leads that had already been run
[1:20:45] give them to my dad and he'd make
[1:20:47] thousands of dollars the next week off
[1:20:49] the same leads
[1:20:51] because people were just dissatisfied
[1:20:54] and they never could make any money
[1:20:55] because they were dissatisfied with what
[1:20:57] they have
[1:20:57] god help us not to be that way we've got
[1:21:00] to find life and how to live it to be
[1:21:02] content
[1:21:03] with what we have you realize
[1:21:07] satan even tried that on jesus
[1:21:10] tried to make him dissatisfied with the
[1:21:12] plan that god had for his life and he
[1:21:13] showed him all the kingdoms of the world
[1:21:15] that's what satan does he uses visual
[1:21:17] means
[1:21:18] to try to show you all the things that
[1:21:20] you could have if you would just follow
[1:21:22] him
[1:21:23] say god help us today that we would stay
[1:21:25] right with the word
[1:21:27] like jesus did amen he stayed right with
[1:21:30] the word and he defeated the devil not
[1:21:31] with his supernatural power
[1:21:32] but just with the word of god and it was
[1:21:34] satan trying to make him dissatisfied
[1:21:37] by showing him what was his i don't need
[1:21:40] what you got
[1:21:42] huh if there are things i could do to
[1:21:45] have the church full of people there's
[1:21:48] things we could do to do that we could
[1:21:49] let down some bars
[1:21:51] but i don't need those people i don't
[1:21:53] need that money
[1:21:54] are you with me today i need christ
[1:21:58] i need the word amen you need the same
[1:22:01] thing
[1:22:04] oh sure you could make more money you
[1:22:06] could do something different but you
[1:22:08] want to
[1:22:09] have christ so you
[1:22:12] give up egypt to take christ
[1:22:17] brother branham says this he said excuse
[1:22:20] this expression
[1:22:22] i told my wife here they're not long ago
[1:22:23] she both he said both getting old and i
[1:22:25] said to her i said do you love me like
[1:22:26] you used to
[1:22:28] there's a good question she said i
[1:22:30] certainly do
[1:22:32] i said you know i love you so much so i
[1:22:33] would like to take you and pull you
[1:22:35] inside of me so we could just be really
[1:22:37] be one he said i just love you that much
[1:22:39] and it's kind of a crude way of putting
[1:22:41] it but
[1:22:42] random says that multiple times in the
[1:22:43] message he said now that
[1:22:46] multiply that by a hundred million
[1:22:48] you'll find out how that the believer
[1:22:51] who falls in love with christ wants to
[1:22:54] get into him
[1:22:55] because it's a love and here he's going
[1:22:58] to show us how
[1:22:59] through these promises he said we might
[1:23:02] be partakers of christ's divine nature
[1:23:05] these mortal bodies how that we can be
[1:23:06] partakers
[1:23:08] he said i might say something here he
[1:23:10] said the reason i believe now someone
[1:23:12] got me all wrong here not long ago i got
[1:23:13] a letter
[1:23:14] from the ministerial association that
[1:23:16] said i believe that we were soul mated
[1:23:18] and we must leave our command companions
[1:23:20] if we're not soul mated to them to marry
[1:23:21] another one we were soul mated to
[1:23:23] he said oh my he said i'm not guilty of
[1:23:25] a heresy like that
[1:23:28] he said i've always been against that i
[1:23:29] don't believe in that certainly not i
[1:23:30] believe
[1:23:31] i i believe that god gives us a mate
[1:23:33] that's true
[1:23:35] he said and then we become part of each
[1:23:37] other again i've told you before
[1:23:41] you say well who's my my mate my eternal
[1:23:44] mate in heaven
[1:23:44] the person you're married to why would
[1:23:47] you believe
[1:23:48] anything else someone asked me do you
[1:23:51] believe so-and-so and your family went
[1:23:52] to heaven why would i believe they went
[1:23:53] to hell
[1:23:55] what good does that do me i've got to
[1:23:57] lean on the mercy of god
[1:24:00] and the grace of god recognized i'm not
[1:24:02] the judge
[1:24:04] right and so why would i believe that i
[1:24:06] should be married to somebody
[1:24:08] else i know that's not right
[1:24:11] and just even if i had no love or no
[1:24:13] affection or anything i could say well
[1:24:15] i'll start there and move up from there
[1:24:17] god put me with them for a reason
[1:24:22] now and i'm thank god we have love in
[1:24:25] our marriage because the truth is
[1:24:27] i can try to talk you into staying
[1:24:28] married if you don't have love you won't
[1:24:34] now brother branham says before man gets
[1:24:36] married he said
[1:24:38] he should think these things over and
[1:24:39] study it he said a young man asked me
[1:24:41] the other day he said you think i ought
[1:24:42] to get married brother branham was such
[1:24:43] and such a girl
[1:24:44] i said how much do you think of her he
[1:24:47] said oh my i just love her.
[1:24:50] you know i don't think the young man was
[1:24:52] standing there saying well i love her
[1:24:57] i think he had some passion to it and
[1:25:00] the prophet of god could see that oh i
[1:25:01] just love her
[1:25:03] he said well if you're not going to live
[1:25:04] without her you better marry her then
[1:25:08] isn't that the way we could be about
[1:25:09] christ oh i just love him
[1:25:12] now there's something deeper to it it
[1:25:14] goes into our emotions it's not all
[1:25:15] about emotions
[1:25:16] but there's something about a man that
[1:25:18] loves god it does something to you
[1:25:20] does something to your heart he said but
[1:25:23] if you can live without it you better
[1:25:24] not but if it's going to kill you you
[1:25:25] better
[1:25:26] go ahead and get married and what i was
[1:25:28] trying to get to him is this that if you
[1:25:29] love her so much
[1:25:31] he said now right now before you're
[1:25:32] married everything is just fine and
[1:25:33] dandy
[1:25:34] after you get married then the toils and
[1:25:36] trials of life come in
[1:25:37] that's when you've got to be so in love
[1:25:39] that you understand one another
[1:25:41] when you when you're disappointed in her
[1:25:43] she's disappointed in you
[1:25:44] you still understand one another that's
[1:25:47] the way it is with christ
[1:25:49] see we've got to be so in love with him
[1:25:51] that when we ask for something and he
[1:25:53] doesn't
[1:25:54] give it to us that doesn't shake us a
[1:25:56] bit
[1:26:01] there's there's been things my wife's
[1:26:03] asking me for i couldn't get for i
[1:26:04] wanted to
[1:26:05] but i couldn't do it either mostly
[1:26:07] because i didn't have the money
[1:26:09] but sometimes because i just knew it
[1:26:11] wouldn't be good
[1:26:14] and there's things i've asked her for
[1:26:15] that she knew wouldn't be good
[1:26:19] that's just the truth i'm just being
[1:26:20] honest with you
[1:26:22] sometimes we've got to say no but it
[1:26:24] didn't shake us a bit
[1:26:26] why there's a reason why and if you love
[1:26:29] one another you you're a partaker of
[1:26:31] their nature
[1:26:33] now brother i think his brother david
[1:26:36] had talked to me about how that you
[1:26:37] finish one another's sentences
[1:26:39] and one one of you all did and maybe
[1:26:41] brother mark was talking about that as
[1:26:42] well
[1:26:43] he finishes his wife's sentences that's
[1:26:45] good and bad
[1:26:46] but see you're part of each other's
[1:26:48] nature you just
[1:26:50] you just become part of one another you
[1:26:52] become so one
[1:26:53] until you couldn't do without that
[1:26:54] person and that's the way we are with
[1:26:57] christ
[1:26:58] he said the only way you can do that is
[1:26:59] to become partakers of his divine nature
[1:27:01] then you'll understand the reason
[1:27:03] he can't give it to you be a partaker of
[1:27:06] his divine nature
[1:27:08] i want you to think spiritually now
[1:27:09] before we close
[1:27:12] you see god has called us and i believe
[1:27:15] in our marriages too to come back to
[1:27:17] that place but
[1:27:18] speaking spiritually now he's called us
[1:27:20] back to eden
[1:27:22] and this is a mistake that people make
[1:27:23] he said where are we going back to are
[1:27:25] we going back to 1906
[1:27:27] are we going back to 1960 are we going
[1:27:30] back to
[1:27:31] are we going back to the early church
[1:27:33] yes we are
[1:27:34] but we're going back farther than that
[1:27:37] right we don't stop there in fact
[1:27:38] brother branham makes a statement that
[1:27:40] pentecost represented that again
[1:27:42] we're not stopping at pentecost we're
[1:27:45] going back further than that
[1:27:47] we've got higher potentials than just
[1:27:49] the return of the gifts
[1:27:51] we've got higher potentials than even
[1:27:53] having a good service though that's part
[1:27:55] of it
[1:27:55] you got to get there first you got to
[1:27:57] have the good service before you can
[1:27:58] have the rest
[1:28:00] you have to go through that but there's
[1:28:02] got to be somewhere you're going that's
[1:28:04] beyond that
[1:28:06] we're going back to eden again
[1:28:10] we're going back to paradise again we're
[1:28:12] going back to a place that we can't even
[1:28:14] comprehend with the jt right now
[1:28:16] we can't even comprehend it but we're
[1:28:18] going back there
[1:28:20] amen brother banham tells us she said
[1:28:23] look back you under when adam was
[1:28:24] leaving with the sweetheart
[1:28:26] going out under condemnation with a
[1:28:27] shadow of redemption somewhere
[1:28:29] because there was blood running over
[1:28:31] them somewhere there was a shadow he
[1:28:33] knew it
[1:28:34] here's something going he said what is
[1:28:37] it it's the old bloody sheepskin beating
[1:28:39] up and down on his legs
[1:28:41] speaking of some time there's a land
[1:28:44] behind the river that they call the
[1:28:45] sweet forever and we only reach that
[1:28:46] shore
[1:28:47] by faith decree he said knowing that
[1:28:49] someday they'd get back into eden again
[1:28:53] you see redemption takes us back to eden
[1:28:57] hallelujah brother bradley said man is
[1:29:00] still the same man is always praising
[1:29:01] god for what he has done
[1:29:03] they're talking about what he will do
[1:29:05] and ignoring what he's doing
[1:29:07] he said that's the nature of man now
[1:29:08] watch this he said let's look at him
[1:29:11] what he is doing now
[1:29:13] what is god doing today he is jesus
[1:29:16] christ the same yesterday today and
[1:29:18] forever
[1:29:18] the same jehovah god that was made
[1:29:20] manifest in him
[1:29:22] he said at that day you'll know that i
[1:29:24] was in the father and the father in me
[1:29:25] and i and you and you and me
[1:29:27] god condescending from a pillar of fire
[1:29:30] to a man
[1:29:30] and from that man sacrificed life the
[1:29:33] blood that cleansed us and come down
[1:29:35] into us to fellowship again
[1:29:37] what's he doing right now to pull out a
[1:29:40] church for an eden again
[1:29:44] amen i couldn't leave this message if i
[1:29:47] wanted to
[1:29:48] because i'm the one that god wanted in
[1:29:51] eden
[1:29:53] amen there was only one eve he had to go
[1:29:57] out with her
[1:29:58] because there was only one hey there's
[1:30:01] only one bride
[1:30:03] there's only one bride you could take
[1:30:04] that down on an individual level
[1:30:06] there's only one of you he has to have
[1:30:09] you this end time bride cannot fall
[1:30:12] why can it not fall because he's going
[1:30:14] to make sure you don't fall
[1:30:17] amen i'm so grateful for that tonight
[1:30:20] i'm so grateful for his mercy
[1:30:22] because brother branham said if i if it
[1:30:24] wasn't for election he said i'd be a
[1:30:26] pretty discouraged man
[1:30:28] because you see everything going on
[1:30:29] around you but there's something about
[1:30:31] you you know
[1:30:32] you've been called to a higher place a
[1:30:33] better place
[1:30:35] he said god condescending from a pillar
[1:30:37] of fire to a man and now back to eden he
[1:30:39] said notice then
[1:30:40] one like the first adam and eve before
[1:30:41] sin separated them in death now
[1:30:44] christ the second adam in life redeems
[1:30:46] his bride from death
[1:30:48] and now where are we at on his way back
[1:30:50] to the original eden
[1:30:53] that's the next step that's where we're
[1:30:56] going amen
[1:30:58] hallelujah restoring back his bride in
[1:31:00] fellowship
[1:31:02] back with god and husband and wife you
[1:31:04] realize what he's doing
[1:31:05] he's bringing us back to that perfect
[1:31:07] place again
[1:31:09] what does he have to do before he can
[1:31:11] bring us back what do you have to do in
[1:31:12] your marriage before you can have
[1:31:13] paradise again you've got to restore a
[1:31:16] broken fellowship
[1:31:19] very bad how do you do that you can't it
[1:31:22] won't just happen automatically
[1:31:25] someone's got to take the first step and
[1:31:28] you and i couldn't take the first step
[1:31:31] it was impossible for us brother paul to
[1:31:33] take the first step he had to take the
[1:31:35] first step
[1:31:36] he had to step into the human flesh and
[1:31:38] come down and live and die for me
[1:31:41] to restore back his bride and fellowship
[1:31:43] back with god as husband and wife
[1:31:45] in the garden of eden christ and his
[1:31:47] bride
[1:31:48] amen and god at that day the kingdom
[1:31:51] shall be given over the father he might
[1:31:53] be all in all
[1:31:54] he's just speaking all here david's
[1:31:56] sitting on the throne
[1:31:58] the king of the whole human race while
[1:32:00] they're yet thinking i'll know what
[1:32:01] they're thinking about what a great
[1:32:03] place that'll be
[1:32:04] before they speak i'll answer them the
[1:32:06] wolf and the lamb shall feed together
[1:32:08] the lion shall eat straw like a bully
[1:32:09] they shall feed together and lay down
[1:32:11] they shall not hurt nor destroy it on my
[1:32:13] holy mountain
[1:32:14] right back exactly to eden again as hard
[1:32:17] as
[1:32:17] it can go very bad you might think this
[1:32:21] world is going
[1:32:22] down fast but let me tell you you're
[1:32:24] going right back to eden
[1:32:26] again not on a soak it's so great but
[1:32:28] you're going back as hard as you can go
[1:32:31] amen amen just as fast as the rock and
[1:32:35] roll group
[1:32:36] was marching down into hell just as fast
[1:32:38] as they were going down into hell
[1:32:40] the bride was going up to onward
[1:32:41] christian soldiers
[1:32:43] amen amen do you believe that tonight
[1:32:48] musicians come how are we going to get
[1:32:51] there
[1:32:53] i want to go i
[1:32:58] i want to go back you ever get that way
[1:33:02] if you ever break fellowship in a
[1:33:03] marriage
[1:33:04] i think all of us have at some point or
[1:33:06] another you want to get back to paradise
[1:33:08] again
[1:33:10] how do you get back to eden well you've
[1:33:12] got to restore
[1:33:13] fellowship somebody's got to make the
[1:33:15] first move
[1:33:16] you've got to be willing to take it all
[1:33:17] on yourself all the blame all the guilt
[1:33:20] oh it was my fault that's hard to do
[1:33:24] sometimes
[1:33:25] but he took all the sin all the shame
[1:33:27] all the pain
[1:33:29] took it all away from me took it on
[1:33:32] himself
[1:33:35] i want to go back how am i ever going to
[1:33:36] get back
[1:33:38] how you going to get back in your
[1:33:39] marriage you got to make that move how
[1:33:40] are you ever going to get back to where
[1:33:42] you ought to be in christ
[1:33:43] to that place of perfect communion well
[1:33:46] i want this so bad in my life
[1:33:48] i want you said do you have it all the
[1:33:50] time no but when i do i just feel like
[1:33:52] the world is right there in front of me
[1:33:54] all the promises of god are just laying
[1:33:56] there for me to pick up
[1:33:57] but then at times it feels like i've
[1:34:00] done something that separated me what do
[1:34:01] i do
[1:34:02] quickly i want to run as hard as i can
[1:34:04] to get back to eden again
[1:34:07] back into fellowship where i can look at
[1:34:10] the promises of god as if they're mine
[1:34:12] but caleb we talked about that how the
[1:34:14] gifts operating in things in the church
[1:34:15] we want that
[1:34:16] we want god to move we want but we've
[1:34:18] got to be have that relationship
[1:34:20] first it's got to be relationship
[1:34:23] because if not it'll just be a bunch of
[1:34:24] carnality
[1:34:26] right but there's got to be a
[1:34:27] relationship first where you come back
[1:34:29] into eden again how are we going to get
[1:34:32] there
[1:34:33] how did they lose even one word
[1:34:39] one word she was deceived you said how
[1:34:41] am i ever going to know
[1:34:43] but god gave us a perfect word
[1:34:46] now he did i'm not saying a man was
[1:34:48] perfect but god gave us a perfect word
[1:34:51] there is a difference in a man having
[1:34:53] the power of infallibility in it being
[1:34:55] an infallible man
[1:34:56] there's a difference god sent back the
[1:34:58] power of infallibility
[1:35:02] that's what the message of the hour is
[1:35:03] it's not a man it's not about a man it's
[1:35:05] about christ
[1:35:07] amen to bring us to restore us back to
[1:35:09] take us back to eden again
