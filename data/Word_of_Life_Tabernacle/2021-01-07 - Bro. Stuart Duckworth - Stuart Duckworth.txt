the house of the lord and just appreciate his presence already amen hey man just heard some breaking news there just a little bit ago that god is still in control amen that he's still in control and he's almighty god amen amen with everything going on amen we've got an absolute somebody that we can tie ourselves to amen amen if we could we'll turn the scripture tonight to first peter 5. first peter 5 and 6. i spoke on this thought at brother ivey's on watch night service but i had about 10 minutes to go over a lot of these things so we'll we'll try to take our time tonight and just enjoy the presence of the lord and joy the word of the lord amen amen let's just bow our hearts before him before we read the word lord we just come before you tonight lord and lord we just thank you once again lord that we can come lord to the house of god lord that we can come here tonight with believers of like precious faith lord that that we can come and gather around the word of the hour lord that we can come and and gather in your presence god we just ask the lord just one more time that you'd come lord and just help us tonight lord to be able to step aside lord to be able to minister to your your people lord and lord that it wouldn't be us father that but it would be you that would come and and lord be the one that's glorified among us lord you said in your word that if you lift me up i'll draw all men unto me lord and that's our desire here tonight is to lift you up to lift your word up lord that we can be drawn into your presence father that's our desire lord may you just bless your word as we read it and bless it to your people's hearts we pray in jesus name amen do you love the lord tonight first peter 5 6 says humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of god that he may exalt you in due time casting all your care upon him for he careth for you you can be seated tonight we want to speak on the mighty hand of god and i read this quote the other night it's been humbled thyself it said you know people want power and they really don't know what power is see they don't really know what goes with it the way up is down always and if you want power to see how humble you can get just get away from all your worldly thinking and humble yourselves before god and then you've got more power than the man that runs all over the building and makes a big lot of noise see because you've been able to conquer yourself commit yourself to christ you see to humble yourself before him that's really power and i like those those few statements there that brother brandon make he said because you've been able to conquer yourself what a what a statement that is amen amen to humble yourself and man and commit yourself amen to conquer conquer yourself amen and that's really power he said and to be able to conquer yourself to have to be able to humble yourself to the mighty hand of god to to the mighty conqueror our lord jesus amen one has gone before us and conquered also amen he came to overcome and defeat everything for adam's fallen race for you and i i mean for for sons and daughters of god those that that were lost how many come amen and defeat every bit of that to conquer for you and i am and he defeated sin and man he defeated unbelief in the word there wasn't a sickness that could stand before him but what he could heal and then he came to conquer amen amen the blind could see the death were able to hear and the dead came to life again he conquered in every situation and every atmosphere even the winds and the waves obeyed him amen but even greater than that he was able to conquer himself he said that i only do that which pleases the father his objectives brother said his objectives was to do the will of god who sent him amen and we heard this from my brother seth he said he talked about this that even when he came to the his cross as to his own death he could say not my will but thy will be done and then he was able to conquer his own will he was able to conquer himself and he did that for you and i he didn't just do it for himself but he did it for adam's fallen race i mean and to be able to live a victorious christian life we have to be able to conquer ourselves amen amen and then we can say in in romans 8 it says nay and all these things that we are more than conquerors through him that loved us amen no powers no things present nothing that is to come no no height nor depth amen shall be able to separate us from the love of god that's in christ jesus amen amen we there's nothing that can conquer us because we've been able to conquer ourselves amen because one went before us and he conquered everything and now we are more than conquerors through him that loved us amen and through that amen we conquer our even our own selves amen we we are our own worst enemy amen and no matter what we face we've got to be able to conquer ourselves first amen to be able to commit yourself to christ to be able to commit yourself to his word to what he has said amen that's real power to conquer yourself to commit yourself to him he said that's real power and then shalom he says then we are creatures of time he said and god is a creature of eternity he never did begin and he never will end so why not just commit yourself to him look up and shine with the joy of the light of god's word that's signing today isn't that what we're doing amen we've seen the god of eternity step out amen and speak his word to a generation through a prophet amen and it's been lot to you and i it's shining in the time of darkness amen it's shining in our hearts it's shining amen lighting the path in this dark and final age amen and we as a people amen we've committed ourselves to that god and the god that came in this generation amen not just a prophet amen but a god that come down and vindicated a message to a bride amen and we're walking amen we're walking in the light of god we're walking with joy and man in a time of darkness amen and then we've committed our lives to him amen and that in that god comes down and shows his power in his people's lives amen humble yourselves under the mighty hand of god humble yourselves amen to the god of eternity we being creatures of time amen and we're blending i believe we're blending in with eternity but we're still in this time element amen but we could come tonight to the god of eternity and let him lead me amen let him guide you amen through this dark and weary world that we live in commit ourselves to him the bible says that he's the author and the finisher of my faith amen he knows the story of my life amen he's writing it out even as our brother says that i thought it was so good he's writing it out with his own blood amen amen our lives are covered in his blood amen we're committed to him amen do you believe that tonight amen he's working all things for our good amen those that are called those that love god those that are called according to his purpose and then he's the author and the finisher of our faith amen we've committed our lives to him amen to let him lead us and guide us amen and we believe tonight that we're elected and then we believe that we're a predestinated people amen that we've been called that we've been chosen by god amen to overcome in this age amen do you believe that's who you are tonight i mean i believe that's who i'm preaching to amen the chosen of god in this age amen amen but to commit our lives to him psalms 37 says trust in the lord and do good and so shalt thou dwell in the land and verily thou shalt be fed a lot thyself also in the lord and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart commit our way unto the lord and trust also in him and he shall bring it to pass i love that don't you david said in the psalms also he said my time is in his hands amen he's my refuge in my rock and in a time of trouble amen he he's my rock in a time of trouble and man when i'm in in trouble and when i'm in need and when we're when things look like they're in despair man he's a revealer to me and when he comes in my situation he comes in my despair just like he did job and he reveals himself to me for who he is and who he wants to be in me what he wants to reveal through me amen that god amen amen that god comes amen and david said my time and my time is in his hands and brother branham speaking here in shalom he said my time belongs to him i am his and i'm in his hand because he holds the time and i don't know what the future holds but i know he holds the future so he holds the future so the who holds the future holds me so why should i think about setting forth this that the the other the the other new year i just put myself in his hands and i walk like david did my time is in his hands and he knew that god held the future god david didn't know what the future was but he know the god that had the future he says i don't know what the future is none of us do but we know who holds the future amen david said my time is in his hands amen my my future is in his hands and the uncertainty of the days ahead the uncertainty of what future presents amen it can bring anxiety to a person amen when you don't know what lays ahead but if you commit yourself amen to the god of eternity amen the god that holds all time and then he holds everything in his hands amen then we can walk by faith amen we can look at tomorrow with faith amen we can rise up in the morning and know that know that god the god that conquered death hell in the grave that that god lives in me amen and i don't have to worry about what the future holds i don't have to worry about what politics and things that are going to happen amen because that's not who holds my future but the very god of eternity has my future in his hands i'm not worried about nothing else i'm not worried about what what tomorrow brings let let tomorrow bring what it's going to bring amen the the god amen amen of eternity the that he's greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world i don't have to worry about tomorrow knowing that my time that my future my life is in his hands amen the very the very time that we've been allotted on this earth and we've all got a certain portion of time that we're allotted some some won't make it past just infancy some won't make it past their teenage years but some some would live to a hundred god has a specific time allotted for you and i when god is finished with you and i then that's it amen so why worry about it why worry about it he's in control of everything amen but the very time that i've been a law did amen my allotted time and to serve him upon this earth amen i want to place it back into his hands and i want to give him my oh i want to give him my time my life my everything because we all have an allotted time we all have a specific time amen and let us let us serve god amen amen hebrews 1 who being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person and upholding all things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sin set down on the right hand of the majesty on high so where is he sitting tonight amen where is he sitting in 2021 man where was he sitting in 2020 he was sitting on the right hand of the majesty on high and he continues to sit there amen until he is to come off the throne he continues to sit in that place of majesty he continues to sit in that place of sovereignty and authority and power and supremacy he sits there to not empower and authority and it doesn't matter i told my wife i was going to use this she she said and i i'll have to say that tonight but it doesn't matter who is president jesus is still king do you believe that tonight it doesn't matter though we would want it to go a certain way and if you're a god-fearing american you want to see this country go in the right direction amen but we know that it's got to take a turn for the worst amen we don't have to look at tomorrow with dread and fear because because politics we know are controlled by satan we already know these things amen but we know that it's got to it can't get better it's got to get worse amen we want to see things go in the right direction we want to see our kids grow up in america amen that that has somewhat of a fear of god but that's not the direction that it's going amen but that doesn't mean we have to go in that direction and that doesn't mean that we have to put our faith in our confidence amen in some politician amen but i've got my faith tonight and the one who sits on the throne i've got my faith in the one tonight who's sitting in power and authority amen that that man can do nothing to me unless god allows him to do it and i don't have to live in fear of what man can do to me because god is in control of my future my time is in his hands whatever god whatever purpose i have here upon this earth i've committed to committed it to him commit has a few more t's in it there doesn't it stay committed 15 times real fast may not do nothing may be able to say it all right but we can come tonight amen jesus is still king he's still lord i mean he sits tonight in power and authority he sits tonight as intercessor upon my confession upon my profession upon and god brother said that god locks for us to repeat his word back to him amen we can come to the one tonight that's sitting in power that's sitting in authority and then we can confess his word back to him amen and he says amen and amen amen they believe my word amen and i'm going to come down on their behalf commit your everything to him and the bible says that we can come amen not gently not just tiptoeing but the bible says that we can come boldly before his throne i can come to my father with a need amen with a situation amen knowing that he's in power knowing that i don't have power within myself to do nothing amen but i can come before the throne of god i can come boldly amen i can come in faith amen knowing what we've been taught it means and knowing what we've seen knowing what we've heard and knowing that that god amen he's the same yesterday today and forever amen that when brother branham left the scene that that god didn't leave but he's still here and we can call upon his name amen amen is the mighty god tonight do you believe that he's the mighty god unveiled before his people and then he's shown himself in this day in revelations it says that he's the alpha and the omega the beginning and the end that he's the amen and that ain't got nothing to do with a man or a woman ain't got nothing to do with that amen but amen means so be it and the bible says that he is the amen amen and that his word and what he has said in his word is final and his word is unchanging his word is unfaltering amen and his word remains true tonight and he is the amen and the amen has the final say amen you can't let your past define you amen but let his word define you you can't let the events of of today and even the future define us but we've got to stay true to his word i mean we got to we got to stay with this word and let that define who we are and then he's the faithful and the true witness and in the church age book he says that he is both creator and sustainer the great creator savior god is faithfully working amongst his own right now as the great shepherd of the sheep his very existence is for his own he loves him and he cares for them and his eye is ever upon them think of that his very existence is for you and i come on it's for you and i amen he carried the cross he carried the burden amen with you and i on his mind with you and i in his heart and brother brennan said i want to identify myself there i went to the cross with jesus i want to identify myself so much with him amen because of what he done for me of what he done for you and i that his existence is for his very own and he's faithfully working amongst his sheep to not as the great shepherd amen leading us amen by his mercy leading us by his grace amen amen is the amen tonight and then he's upholding his people he's upholding his people by by the word of his power amen keeping us by the holy ghost in this last age amen and he said i would never i'll never leave you nor forsake you but that i'll be with you even in you to the very end amen amen i'll be with you through 2021 and it's not starting out on a very good note and we don't know what tomorrow holds we don't know what the future holds but we know who holds the future amen amen and god god tonight is obligated to his word and he's obligated to those who believe it amen and i just i just want to encourage you tonight i want to exhort you tonight i want to urge you tonight to stay with the word amen stay with the message of the hour stay stay in the word because by that we'll overcome amen the bible says that we overcome by the blood of the lamb and by the very word of our testimony i mean it's i believe that our testimony won't just be of this and that and in our own thinking and our own logic amen but i believe our testimony will be exactly what the scripture says amen that the word will so become flesh and you and i amen that that's what comes forth from us amen we become the word amen and we overcome by the blood of the lamb amen by the by the power of the holy ghost the broken blood cell we overcome by the holy ghost in us amen in the word amen the holy ghost feeding upon the word amen but god is obligated to his word and brother branham says here god is obligated god's obligated to his word and of the words in you then he's obligated to you with his word the bible says that heavens and earth will pass away but my words shall never fail so if the word is in you if god is obligated to the word then we can never fail because the word is in us and brother branham says he said i challenge any person under any condition to take god at his word and see if it's not right i challenge any person he says under any condition to take god at his word and see if it's right god will always honor his word amen his word went out and it will not return unto him void and then he's obligated to his word he's obligated to his people amen and i believe tonight that we ought to believe the word of god amen we ought to take the word of god and believe it from the very heart amen it's got to come from here down to here amen it's got to be more than a head knowledge or what the preacher says but you've got to take it for yourself you've got to take it for yourself and identify yourself with the word and when you do that god is obligated to take care of you he's obligated to keep you to sustain you amen the creator of heavens and earth amen the very the very god of eternity is obligated to you and i tonight because we believe his word amen i think brother brown said one of the greatest honors we can do is to to read god's word and to believe his word amen amen i'm gonna drink a little bit of water here but if we'll humble if we'll humble ourselves to his word as the scripture says he will exalt us in due time he'll exalt you you think of you know he's going to raise me up above my brother he's going to raise me up above my sister he's going he's really going to show something in my life but that's not what it means he said he'll exalt you and do time he'll and that word exalt means to raise to a place of dignity to raise to a place of honor and happiness i mean that's that's what i want to attain to tonight and i don't want to be better than somebody else and that's not what god's called us to be but he's got a place for us he's got a position and in a place of dignity a place of honor a place of happiness and god wants his children to be happy and then he's got a place that he can exalt us to amen to our to our god-given privileges in the word to our god-given given privileges in jesus christ to heavenly places amen that's our position as believers isn't it amen a god amen he said if you'll if you'll if you'll humble yourselves under the mighty hand of god he will exalt you and then he'll bring you to this place in due time but we've got to humble ourselves we want to we want to try to think things out for ourselves we want to try to try to go down our own path but we've got to humble ourselves under the mighty hand of god aiming to bring us to heavenly places in christ jesus amen amen to where we can enjoy the holy ghost amen to where we don't just walk around in this flesh and in the anointing amen of this day and under the anointing of of the of the chaos and the and the things that the media and the news would portray amen amen but just shake that ain't been in the walk aiming in the blessing of god aiming to walk in the holy spirit amen amen thinking the right thoughts saying the right things doing the right things amen amen walking in the holy ghost amen walking in the holiness of god walking in the purity of the word amen as the bride of jesus christ amen amen amen coming to a place amen where we can be so filled with the power of god amen we can be so filled with this presence amen that in the hard times of life amen he could carry us through a man as sustainer as creator amen he could carry us through and raise us up by his grace amen where we could walk in the joy of the lord amen we all we all get to a place where we lose the joy of our salvation and then we've all been to that spot amen but god wants to exalt us tonight man he wants you to be happy he wants you to live in a place of honor amen he wants to you to live in a place of joy amen as sons and daughters of god amen walking in the joy of the lord for he said the joy david said the joy of the lord is my strength that's where we draw our strength from it's not living in the marley grubs of laodicea living in the moly grubs of politics under that anointing because under that anointing under that anointing is destruction amen but i believe we've been called to something greater something higher than that amen we've been called to a body change we've been called to a rapture amen and the only way you're going to get there is with the holy ghost in you walking in the holy ghost amen walking not in the spirit of this flesh but of the spirit of the word that's the only way we're going to get there amen the joy of the lord is our strength amen amen we live too far below our privileges but if we'll humble ourselves before him he'll exalt us in due time brother branham says here he says you show me a church that's humble that's real humble not an arrogancy a church just a sweet humble church i'll show you a church that has the favor and the power of god and he said that's right that's the thing it takes is humility humbling ourselves before god letting god just work through us amen is that what you want tonight amen to be a church they meant humble amen and sweet with the power of god with the favor of god amen amen there's nothing in this world that could take the place of that i mean there's nothing that you could receive in the life in this life that would be greater than the power and the favor of jesus christ amen i want that favor and power of god amen amen i want my life i want my life pure before him amen i want i want my mind so so pure before him amen walking in the holy ghost amen walking in the favor and power of god with a sweetness amen amen amen he said he said here he said humbling ourselves and just letting god work through us and that's what god wants tonight he wants a witness he wants somebody that can he can get his hands upon he wants somebody he just he just needs one person amen to show his power amen amen i just say tonight let god work through us amen amen let him come and manifest his word let it let us be that type of church here that brother brangham was speaking of the lord colossians 1 13 he says who hath delivered us from the power of darkness and i translated us into the kingdom reign of his dear son and brother branham says he says right now we reign with christ having dominion over sin the world the flesh and the devil showing forth his praise showing forth himself for its christ in us willing and doing of his good pleasure for it's so it's not us but it's he himself in us doing of his good pleasure and that our lives would give him glory that our lives would give him honor that our that our lives were giving praise amen i like how he says he says right now we reign with him over these things right now in this present world in this body amen not in the future but right now we reign over these things he in and we were made to have dominion we were made by god to have dominion do you believe that tonight we were made by god to have dominion over the devil do you believe that amen we were made by by god to have dominion over sin genesis 1 he said and god said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion let them have dominion over the fish let them have dominion over the things that that would crawl upon the earth they would walk upon the earth amen amen and god and adam was a god of the earth he was god of the earth he spoke to the winds and they obeyed if something seemed out of place to eve and many had the power to move it and you know how women are there they're particular they like things a certain way so eve had that within her even though they were they were in an eden but if something seemed out of place because god gave them that position amen as god as god of the earth and they were one their minds were as one as as eve thought so did adam think and as adam thought so did eve think they were one they were one but man was made to have dominion over the earth and i say tonight that we were made to have dominion over this body amen we were made to have dominion over our surroundings do you believe that amen amen if eve didn't like something a certain way adam had the power to move it he had the control they controlled the atmosphere and their surroundings that they lived in being fortified behind the word and being in the position that god ordained them to be in amen and then they were behind the word and then as long as they stayed behind the word amen amen god was with them remember when they got out from around the word they got out of their position and remember while they were behind the word and when they had control of the atmosphere they had control of every living thing around them they had control of the atmosphere in which they lived in do you believe that tonight but they fell from that but we are here to take that position back amen we're here to take that position back of what they held being the redeemed by the second adam jesus christ amen we're here as the redeemed sons and daughters of god aiming to take back our position do you believe that tonight when jesus overcame by the word he showed us the way jesus had power within himself to do whatever he wanted he had the very creative spoken word whatever he said it would be amen but that's not how we're to overcome so jesus couldn't set that thing forth amen but he come under the word he come under the power of the word and that's how jesus overcame and that's how you and i overcome tonight and we shall i believe we shall and we will i believe there's overcomers tonight but i believe we've got more to overcome to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me on my throne it's a continual overcoming battle amen but i believe we'll overcome i believe we'll conquer amen we'll have dominion and then we'll stand in our position by the word and his spirit in us amen and not only stand behind the word as adam and eve did but to become the word amen because jesus wasn't just part of the word he was all of the word and so his bride comes in this day she's not she's not just part of the word she is the word she is she is miss jesus christ do you believe that tonight amen you got to set the you got to set the standard high amen for the bride of leo of this layout to see an age because that's what we're part of and when we're part of that but we're the final bride we're the bride that's not going to fall we're the bride that's going to stay with the word where the brother is going to become the word amen amen [Music] he sits on his throne now is the great high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities adam and eve fell the second adam came to restore us back to our position amen and we're still under that thought that the mighty hand of god to come under that mighty god and he's sitting on the throne tonight he's sitting as the great high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities because these bodies were born in sin they were shaped in iniquity we came into the world speaking lies amen and as we as our souls are redeemed our bodies are yet to be redeemed so our bodies are still under that curse amen so so we're not in that perfect condition yet but we can come to the one that is perfect we can come to the one that can bring healing to our bodies amen we can come to the one amen that can come down and deliver us out of the situation and the needs amen that we have he sits there tonight as one that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities he was tempted in every manner yet without sin the bible says and man he knew what it was like to have a headache he knew what it was like to be rejected he knew what it was like to be forsaken yet he never see him he never disbelieved what the word said he was for he was the word amen the ultimate sacrifice say man he sits tonight and then he sits in authority he sits in power he sits waiting on his children to come to him amen not to come to him this tippy toe and but come to him boldly amen with your needs amen amen with your fears with your everything and then he sits there tonight on the throne as the world goes on as we creatures of time amen as we as things go on as we live out our part there he sits in eternity waiting on his children to call upon his name we got a couple more pages here we'll try to hurry do you love the lord tonight amen amen hebrews 4 16 said let us come therefore boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in a time of need we as humans probably us men we don't want to ask nobody for help i hate to ask somebody to help me i hate to ask somebody if i can borrow something i hate that feeling right my uncles they've all got little tractors they can bush hog and work up ground or whatever i'm always asking can i can i borrow that to go work up my food plot i hate to ask them i hate to ask people for anything i wish i had my own little tractor i've got huge tractors that can move thousands of yards of dirt but i don't have a little tractor but god god can give you the big things but it can give you the little things too amen maybe one day i'll have my own little tractor but we can come to god we don't have to be that way we can come to him amen in a time of need we can come to him amen and obtain mercy amen we can come to him and find grace amen we can come to him and and ask of his favor because we don't deserve these things and we know us humans that we don't deserve these things but yet god has provided it for us he's he's provided mercy he's provided grace amen and grace is something that you did nothing for it's just god's unmerited favor to you and i that god's grace that we could call upon his mercy that we could call upon his grace and then his grace would come down and change the situation amen and work it out for our good we can come to him in a time of need as his children as his sons and his daughters in a time of chaos in a time of unrest in a time of uncertainty when we don't know what the future holds we can go to the god of eternity amen and we can come and we can ask him amen and call upon him first peter 5 verse 7 when we read this verse earlier casting all your care upon him for he careth for you we can come boldly amen to his throne with our needs and then we can come to him with our worries we can come to him with our fears with our doubts amen not coming in an unbelief but but god give me more faith god give me give me more of what i need give me give me what i need give me the strength amen give me the joy that i need amen to come through this situation to come and then come through the next month to come to the year that we're facing a time of uncertainty god give me the faith amen give me the love that i that i have need of give me more of it give me the love that i have have need up for my brother from my sister we can come to god amen he's not a god just some way out somewhere sitting on a in a big chair but he sits upon the throne of your heart he sits upon the throne of your heart and we know that he is out there we know that but it's not as far away as we think amen and god is not the impersonable god that we make him out to be amen but he's here with us he's here in us he said he never leave us nor forsake us that he'd be with us and he said greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world he just wants you to call upon his name give him your everything and then give him all your fears your worries all your all your complexes brother ben spoke about this sunday morning and i got a complex because brother ben preached on complexes because i wanted to preach on complexes and that's how that thing starts starts out over nothing that's where it goes but a complex give him give him your complexes give him your worries give him your cares give him everything that holds you back as a son or daughter of god amen from living in your divine privileges and your god give him rights give it all to him he wants us to cast our cares upon him i mean he wants you to give him your everything amen he wants to give him your needs your time your life your everything and when your failures your ups and downs he wants you to come him into his presence amen where you can be changed in those complexes and i won't touch this song but a complex is just a little thought that comes into your mind i mean a thought that someone doesn't like you or that god doesn't love me and then our hearts aren't right towards our brother and we get cut off from the blessings of god because we believe we think that god doesn't care about our need our situation that i can't ever get my healing so therefore god doesn't love me and you build this little thing up to where you can't really believe the word like you should and that's where it all starts just a little something amen but we've got to move beyond those things we've got to put those things behind us we've got to come to his throne amen amen and if we've got to come to the word we've got to come to a word because if you allow those things and then to rule your life it'll set the wrong kind of atmosphere around you and then it'll drive people away from you and it'll make you in a pitiful condition but if we'll take what god has said about us and i believe this tonight and i'm closing here but if we'll take what god has said about us in his word and truly believe him from the heart it'll create the right kind of atmosphere in our lives it'll it'll create the right kind of mindset that we can set forth today amen not with our heads drooped down but with our hands lifted high and then we can walk in victory amen not as a defeated person amen but as a son of god as a daughter of god amen knowing what the word is said about you amen knowing that you are the word and we can walk in faith we can walk in peace and joy and the power of god and then we can be healed amen because i don't have any kind of complex anything built up in my mind against god i can have my joy restored amen because we're always in need we're always a people in need and when the people of laodicea they're rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing amen but we as the bride we as the church is the final voice of the final aj man amen we we the bride is is the last she's the last one she's going to stay true to the word but she's always in need and then his sons and daughters are always in need more of him musicians can come tonight do you love the lord amen we just stand tonight

i just can't attain into that maybe i can't have that maybe maybe god's keeping this thing from me i mean maybe all it is is you getting that mindset out of the way maybe it's just you humbling yourself before him under his mighty hand that he can bring you to that place in the word that you want to be that place of honor amen to that heavenly place in christ jesus that that place amen your
