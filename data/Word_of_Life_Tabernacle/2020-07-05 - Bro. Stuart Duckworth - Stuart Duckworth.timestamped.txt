[21:32] god does amen
[21:33] we'll just have brother ben come he's
[21:34] just going to take these requests and
[21:36] and maybe just give us just a few
[21:38] announcements but
[21:41] and i guess i forgot we're not taking up
[21:43] offerings so it's in the back so
[21:45] you get up here and you get nervous but
[21:47] here's where the pin
[21:51] thank you brother allen you can be
[21:52] seated for just a moment
[21:54] and thank you for being here this
[21:56] morning
[21:57] um i know that uh for me uh i've been
[22:01] shut up in the house for a while and so
[22:03] to be in the house of god
[22:04] is a great thing just to be able to be
[22:06] here and
[22:07] and uh thank you very much for your
[22:10] prayers we've had a
[22:13] rough time of it over the last couple of
[22:15] weeks but you know whenever you look at
[22:17] your own situation you realize
[22:19] that someone else has worse situation
[22:22] than you do
[22:23] that's always the case and so i am
[22:25] grateful that it wasn't as bad for us
[22:28] as it was for some others um
[22:31] i know of pastors who have been in the
[22:32] hospital there's a couple of pastors
[22:35] that i know in the hospital now
[22:37] from this and so continue to pray for
[22:41] them
[22:42] and we know that god has all things in
[22:44] control
[22:45] and so it wasn't as bad for us as it was
[22:48] for some others
[22:50] you might be able to tell i'm still just
[22:52] a little congested i'm not contagious
[22:54] i haven't been for a while but i will
[22:56] stay away from you just in case and to
[22:58] make you feel better today
[23:00] and you know
[23:03] going through this has been one of the
[23:05] hardest things that i've ever been
[23:06] through
[23:07] and then starting off pastoring the
[23:09] church and doing this
[23:11] but there must be a reason for it
[23:14] and it's going to produce a character in
[23:16] us that hasn't been
[23:18] there before that wouldn't have been
[23:20] there every generation
[23:22] goes through its trials and its troubles
[23:23] and this is our generation
[23:25] this is what we have to deal with and so
[23:27] we're grateful and i am
[23:28] again i'm so thankful for every one of
[23:30] you keep my family and your prayers
[23:33] they're going to be shut up for a while
[23:36] because
[23:38] of the way that it's worked it's going
[23:41] to be a couple more weeks before they're
[23:42] able to leave the house and my kids
[23:45] especially the older ones are about to
[23:46] go crazy so you remember them in
[23:49] in your prayers and and it'll be a
[23:51] little while before they'll be able to
[23:53] be back in church
[23:54] just because of the timeline and things
[23:56] and and uh
[23:58] pray for your church and uh we're
[24:00] thankful to have each one of you here
[24:02] the herrings i think this
[24:03] is probably your last service before you
[24:05] move
[24:06] so we're grateful to have you we we're
[24:08] grateful that we've been able to
[24:09] adjourn with you and hopefully you'll
[24:11] continue to come and
[24:13] and i wish there could be more here this
[24:15] morning i know some are gone some are
[24:17] sick
[24:18] and many are concerned about the
[24:20] situation that we're in
[24:22] but if you're listening this morning
[24:23] just pay attention to the word of god
[24:24] and i believe god will
[24:26] will bless you stand with me if you
[24:28] would and we'll go to
[24:30] um prayer i stand up here i'm going to
[24:32] preach
[24:34] and without any notes that we would be
[24:36] here a while
[24:37] so brother stewart is going to preach
[24:39] this morning and i'm grateful to him
[24:41] for doing that those of you that were
[24:42] here wednesday night brother allen
[24:45] preached and i i understand he did a
[24:47] magnificent job and i'm
[24:49] apologized that we couldn't get the
[24:50] streaming working
[24:52] but uh you'll just have to come back
[24:54] next time brother allen is speaking and
[24:56] and i understand it was just a wonderful
[24:58] sermon and
[25:00] we know that god has all things in his
[25:02] control do you believe that this morning
[25:04] do we really believe that when we get
[25:07] done with this there's not going to be
[25:08] anything
[25:08] left but our reliance on god that's it
[25:12] that's all we're going to be able to
[25:13] rely on we can't rely we've taken all
[25:15] the measures we can take
[25:17] to keep each other safe and in the end
[25:19] it's going to be up to god
[25:20] and that's all we can do and so we're
[25:22] grateful
[25:24] we'll continue to do everything we can
[25:25] to keep you safe but we're grateful that
[25:27] god is still
[25:28] on the throne he's still the same
[25:31] yesterday today and forever

[25:35] in have had to cancel either i've had to
[25:37] cancel on them or they've had to cancel

[38:05] god himself that formed the earth and
[38:08] made it
[38:08] he hath established him he created it
[38:11] not in vain

[38:15] the lord and there is none else
[38:18] and i have not spoken in secret in a
[38:20] dark place of the earth i said not
[38:22] unto the seat of jacob seek ye me in
[38:24] vain
[38:25] i am the lord i the lord speak
[38:28] righteousness i declare things that are
[38:30] right assemble yourselves and come

[38:44] save
[38:45] tell ye and bring them near ye let them
[38:49] take counsel together
[38:50] who hath declared this from ancient time
[38:53] who hath told it from that time have not
[38:55] i the lord
[38:57] and there is no god else beside me a
[38:59] just god and a savior
[39:01] and there is none beside me and look
[39:04] unto me
[39:05] and be ye saved all the ends of the
[39:07] earth for i
[39:08] am god and there is none else
[39:11] amen let's just bow our hearts before
[39:13] the lord today just

[40:30] inhabited
[40:31] amen he didn't form it just for for no
[40:34] reason
[40:34] but for a purpose that that it would be
[40:37] inhabited
[40:38] amen amen and this earth is actually
[40:42] what's meant to be our dominion amen and

[40:47] earth this body
[40:49] that that we walk in amen that god has

[41:01] in the word for our day in our lives
[41:04] amen aligning with the word amen and
[41:06] having dominion
[41:07] over the things of this life amen to be
[41:11] subject
[41:12] to god's word he formed he formed us to
[41:15] be inhabited
[41:16] by his presence amen in him alone is
[41:20] salvation
[41:21] in him alone is redemption amen in him
[41:25] is to be a healer
[41:26] amen to be our god and we we know today
[41:29] that he is our father
[41:31] and he wants to express amen to his
[41:34] attributes to his family
[41:36] who he is this morning amen that he's a
[41:39] savior
[41:40] that he's a redeemer that he can bring
[41:41] you out from any situation
[41:43] amen no matter how far you would fall
[41:46] and he can bring you out because that
[41:48] that is an expression of who he is that
[41:50] that's who god is
[41:52] to you and i amen and he wants he wants
[41:55] to be our healer he wants he wants to be
[41:56] your god he wants to express himself
[41:59] as that but he's saying look

[42:05] saying look there there's none else
[42:06] beside me
[42:08] i am god alone amen this morning he's
[42:11] the true and living god
[42:13] leading his people amen healing his
[42:16] people
[42:16] amen amen bringing us through amen he's
[42:20] the god that has spoken
[42:21] amen and revealed himself to us in these
[42:24] last days
[42:25] amen aren't you thankful for that and
[42:28] that god came by your way one day
[42:30] and revealed himself to you and i'm
[42:32] thankful for that i'm thankful for a
[42:34] prophet
[42:35] in the end time that that pointed us to
[42:37] christ
[42:38] i mean he didn't he didn't point us to a
[42:40] denomination or some system but he
[42:42] he pointed us back to the word away from
[42:45] these systems
[42:47] amen that will have an end
[42:50] he would preach to us sermons uh
[42:53] towering them looking unto jesus
[42:55] look away to jesus amen and a true
[42:58] prophet will never point
[42:59] the people to himself but he'll point
[43:01] them to the word he'll point them
[43:03] to christ amen and he says in here
[43:07] looking unto jesus
[43:09] he says that's been the call for years
[43:11] look unto me ye ends of the earth
[43:14] he said i would like to kind of turn
[43:15] that just a little bit look especially
[43:17] unto me at the end of each world system
[43:20] listen to this because he always makes
[43:22] himself known
[43:24] so real at the end of the world system
[43:27] when it's coming to its
[43:28] end he said look unto me all yins i
[43:31] might say the scripture the ends
[43:33] the ends of the earth amen so at the end
[43:37] at the end of the system at the end and
[43:39] there's been
[43:41] many ends of different civilizations in
[43:43] different times
[43:44] throughout history and god always comes
[43:46] and makes himself known
[43:49] and he's making himself known amen
[43:51] because we know we're at the end
[43:53] of the end of the end and as brother
[43:55] adam said he he always comes down
[43:57] at the end and makes himself known and
[44:00] so real
[44:01] that the people will be without without
[44:05] anything they'll have no excuse amen
[44:09] and i believe this morning i believe
[44:11] he's still making himself known to his
[44:14] people
[44:14] amen i believe he's a faithful god this
[44:17] morning
[44:17] do you believe that i believe he's still
[44:20] making himself known still
[44:22] revealing himself amen still showing
[44:24] more of himself
[44:25] revealing and manifesting himself to
[44:27] those who have recognized their day
[44:30] and its message that he's saying look
[44:33] look to me
[44:34] amen look away from this world look away
[44:37] from these systems
[44:38] and look unto me because i'm god and
[44:41] there is none beside me
[44:43] amen if you look at the world and the
[44:45] condition that we see
[44:47] you know you know no doubt some of the
[44:50] elders here have seen
[44:51] strange times but i bet if we got
[44:53] together and started asking them one by
[44:56] one
[44:56] have you ever seen anything quiet like
[44:58] we're going through now
[45:00] and i bet most of them would say this is
[45:03] a different time
[45:04] it's not just one thing that we're
[45:06] dealing with or two things or three
[45:08] things but it's multiple
[45:09] multiple things that are coming upon the
[45:11] earth amen and we know that
[45:13] when when the daylight is breaking it
[45:15] right before the break of daylight it
[45:17] gets dark that's the most darkest time
[45:20] that there is right before the breaking
[45:22] of the day
[45:23] amen that that's the that's the dismal
[45:25] time that we live in
[45:26] amen but he said in the evening time
[45:28] there shall be light
[45:30] there shall be light among my people
[45:32] there will be gross darkness
[45:33] but among you there will be light
[45:37] amen it's a dismal day it's a dark day
[45:40] it's a time when
[45:41] all kinds of things are coming upon the
[45:43] earth amen but god
[45:44] is faithful this morning amen and he's
[45:47] saying look unto me
[45:48] he's saying this morning i am god i am
[45:51] the god that heals all thy diseases
[45:53] amen i'm your deliverer i'm your
[45:55] redeemer
[45:59] amen just had this thought that
[46:02] you know what's coming true that this
[46:04] world can't sustain
[46:05] itself anymore and it's got to come to
[46:08] that point and we know
[46:09] that this earth that we're walking upon
[46:12] is as he said in the scripture
[46:13] it must be inhabited god created it to
[46:16] be inhabited
[46:17] but this condition that it's in is
[46:19] becoming unfit
[46:20] more unfit amen and god we know that god
[46:24] will send a fire
[46:25] god will send a holy fire amen and
[46:27] cleanse this earth
[46:28] that he and his people can walk walk
[46:32] upon this earth with no sin
[46:34] no sickness no disease amen that's where
[46:36] we're coming to
[46:38] it's got to come to that spot amen to
[46:40] where god
[46:42] actually does that we see it more and
[46:45] more
[46:45] we know we know we understand where
[46:47] we're at
[46:50] we know that america brother branham
[46:51] said to turn down the gospel it's beyond
[46:53] redemption
[46:54] and i believe while we're here we should
[46:56] always continually try to stand for
[46:58] what's right
[46:59] we should try to try to lean more amen
[47:02] to what's right and try to
[47:03] try to have a at least a decent place to
[47:06] live while we're here
[47:07] but we know that it's beyond redemption
[47:09] we know that america has turned down
[47:12] god and if it wasn't for you and i
[47:15] still being here this place would be
[47:17] destroyed
[47:18] we know that politics are rotten we know
[47:20] that there's no hope in that
[47:22] we know that there's no there's no hope
[47:24] in that it's rotten to the core
[47:27] and it's over with aren't you thankful
[47:31] amen this morning that you've heard
[47:32] god's voice that your hope is not
[47:35] in a god that cannot save that it's not
[47:38] in politics
[47:39] it's not in in some civilization or some
[47:42] some superpower somewhere amen that's a
[47:45] god that cannot say this morning
[47:47] amen but i believe we're a people that
[47:49] have heard his voice
[47:50] amen we've recognized his voice and
[47:52] we've taken heed
[47:55] amen he's declaring he's declaring
[47:58] continually come out of her my people
[48:00] come out of this system this system that
[48:02] will have an end
[48:04] amen god's voice in this day
[48:08] i believe has shook the earth he said in
[48:11] there as we read it earlier i the lord
[48:13] speak righteousness
[48:14] i declare the things that are right amen
[48:18] as the truth goes forth
[48:19] amen amen as the truth goes forth amen
[48:22] if you'll accept that it's mercy to you
[48:25] but brethren say if you reject it that
[48:27] becomes judgment
[48:29] amen to us it's mercy but to them it
[48:32] becomes judgment the thing that saved
[48:33] noah
[48:34] was the very thing that destroyed the
[48:37] world in his day
[48:38] is that right we understand these things
[48:42] to be able to accept the truth to be
[48:44] able to to be able to believe it and
[48:45] hold on to it as mercy
[48:47] for you and i do you believe that this
[48:49] morning
[48:51] jesus said let every man's word be
[48:53] allowed mind be the truth
[48:54] and it's coming to that amen we've got
[48:57] to stand on the word of god
[48:59] we've got to stand on what we believe is
[49:00] truth amen and
[49:02] unwaver from that stay there and stand
[49:04] there and take your stand
[49:06] amen in this in this life amen
[49:09] amen his word is our true reality
[49:13] in the midst of chaos so in the midst of
[49:16] chaos in the midst of what you can see
[49:18] or what you can hear amen amen lying
[49:21] vanities to you and i
[49:23] amen because we have a different reality
[49:25] we have a truth
[49:27] we have something that set us free amen
[49:29] something that's that's freed us from
[49:31] this world
[49:31] amen amen has become a reality to us
[49:36] apart from these other things though
[49:38] we're walking in the midst of it
[49:40] though we're in the midst of chaos you
[49:41] and i this morning we have a different
[49:43] reality
[49:44] we have the reality of god's word of his
[49:47] promised word amen
[49:49] amen as we've said it before and as the
[49:52] scripture says his word is spirit
[49:54] and in his life amen it's what holds us
[49:56] in this age amen it's what holds us
[49:59] it's more than life to us and we can say
[50:02] that that our hopes
[50:04] aren't in politics in the in this nation
[50:07] but my hope this morning is in jesus
[50:10] amen my hope is in the return
[50:12] and the coming of the lord jesus amen
[50:14] the kingdoms of this world will be
[50:15] shaken
[50:16] amen the earth is being shaken as the
[50:18] scripture says the earth is being shaken
[50:20] and the heavens also and that which is
[50:23] not founded upon christ
[50:24] amen upon christ the word will crumble
[50:28] it will fall it will have an end it will
[50:30] be no more
[50:32] anything that has a beginning has an end
[50:35] do you believe that but you and i this
[50:37] morning
[50:38] you and i this morning amen we've
[50:41] recognized something different
[50:43] amen amen we've recognized amen we
[50:45] founded ourselves
[50:46] upon something different amen we've
[50:48] received that eternal life
[50:50] amen in our nature is no more of the
[50:53] world
[50:54] amen our our soul and the nature of it
[50:56] was to sin
[50:57] and to do the things of the world amen
[50:59] amen but when god came
[51:01] in and man he didn't he didn't change
[51:03] who you were amen he didn't he didn't
[51:05] kill your spirit or kill
[51:06] kill your body off but he changed that
[51:09] nature
[51:09] that old nature died with inside you
[51:11] amen the nature of the world and you
[51:13] took on
[51:14] god's nature and when you receive that
[51:18] eternal life well i can tell i haven't
[51:20] preached in a while because i got
[51:22] zero voice right now
[51:25] that's not a good feeling when you're
[51:28] about five minutes in
[51:33] you love the lord this morning amen
[51:38] i have to get my voice conditioned back
[51:41] or speak a little different amen
[51:44] anything that
[51:44] had a beginning will have an end
[51:48] amen so when you receive that eternal
[51:50] life
[51:51] amen it's because you were an eternal
[51:53] creature before
[51:55] you didn't just one day become an
[51:56] eternal creature but because you were
[51:58] you were part of god you could receive
[52:00] that eternal life
[52:02] we understand that the brotherhood
[52:05] said it like this you you can no more
[52:07] die than god can die is that right in
[52:09] the book of hebrews
[52:11] and just continue with that thought that
[52:13] this world amen and everything is going
[52:15] to be shaken
[52:16] and it says for a year not coming to the
[52:18] mount that might
[52:19] be touched and that with with that burn
[52:23] with fire nor unto the blackness and
[52:24] darkness and tempest so so moses
[52:26] he came under this mountain and then he
[52:29] came into this
[52:30] this mountain that that he you might not
[52:32] be touched and burned with fire and
[52:34] darkness
[52:34] and it said and he exceedingly feared
[52:37] and quaked
[52:38] but i say this morning that we have not
[52:40] come amen we have not come to a place of
[52:43] fear
[52:43] amen but as the scripture says you have
[52:45] come to mount zion
[52:47] under the city of the living god the
[52:49] heavenly jerusalem
[52:50] amen this morning to an innumerable
[52:52] company of angels we've come
[52:54] we've come not to a place of fear but
[52:56] we've come to a place of identification
[52:58] amen to the living god amen there's an
[53:01] innumerable
[53:02] company of angels we've not come to fear
[53:05] this morning
[53:07] this morning we've come to the portion
[53:09] of the word for our day
[53:10] amen not a place of uncertainty amen
[53:13] amen
[53:14] we've heard a trumpet and that trumpet
[53:16] did not give an uncertain sound
[53:18] amen but it was a sound that came from
[53:20] the scripture
[53:21] amen and we know who we are this morning
[53:23] we've recognized who we are
[53:25] in the word founded this morning upon
[53:28] thus
[53:28] saith the lord amen recognizing what
[53:30] we've come to
[53:32] amen not a place not a place of fear
[53:34] amen but recognizing that we are the
[53:36] rapture
[53:38] that we are the last and final group
[53:40] amen the last and final overcomer
[53:43] am in the final voice to the final age
[53:47] but those things that that can't be
[53:50] shaken
[53:50] they shall remain if you can be shaken
[53:54] you will have an end and that's how
[53:56] steady we must be anchored
[53:58] amen when the shaking time comes we
[54:01] shall remain
[54:03] it goes on in hebrews wherefore we're
[54:05] receiving a kingdom
[54:07] which cannot be moved let us have grace
[54:09] whereby we may serve god
[54:10] acceptably with reverence and godly fear
[54:15] amen do you love the lord this morning
[54:21] revelation 10 the bible declares that
[54:25] time should be no more
[54:27] and we can see the world can see what
[54:30] we're coming to
[54:31] they can feel it but they don't under
[54:34] actually understand how close
[54:36] we are they don't really truly
[54:39] understand what lays ahead
[54:41] but you and i this morning we have an
[54:43] understanding
[54:44] we can look into the word we can look
[54:46] into the message
[54:47] and then we can have an understanding
[54:50] and we can prepare ourselves
[54:52] and we can make ourselves ready because
[54:54] god has given you an understanding
[54:56] he's gave you you mercy he's gave you
[54:59] his word
[55:00] that we can prepare our lives for what
[55:03] lays ahead
[55:04] that we can escape the judgments and
[55:07] i'll say this morning as the scripture
[55:09] says the lord
[55:10] is not slack concerning his promise amen
[55:13] we are living in the very long suffering
[55:16] of god
[55:16] and then he's allowing things to go on
[55:19] he's allowing it to go further because
[55:21] he had a desire that none would be lost
[55:24] god god desired that no man would be
[55:26] lost
[55:26] he wants people to come in he wants
[55:28] people to be saved
[55:29] he wants people to be filled with the
[55:31] holy ghost
[55:32] and i say great is it salvation today
[55:35] amen has not diminished
[55:37] he's saying look look unto me there is
[55:40] none other
[55:41] i am god and there is none other beside
[55:43] me i alone
[55:44] amen in me alone is salvation
[55:50] in the seventh seal and i'll just read
[55:52] some of this
[55:54] everything runs out in time the end of
[55:56] time
[55:57] at the end of the seventh seal notice
[55:59] it's the end of the church ages the end
[56:01] of the seventh seal
[56:02] it's the end of the trumpets it's the
[56:04] end of the vials and even
[56:05] even in the ushering in of the
[56:07] millennium that's on the seventh seal
[56:09] it's just like a
[56:10] firing rocket into the air and and that
[56:13] rocket explodes here and it goes up and
[56:14] then it explodes again
[56:16] and it puts out five stars and one of
[56:18] those stars explode and it blows out
[56:20] five stars
[56:21] from it and then one of them stars
[56:23] explodes and it blows out five star
[56:25] stars from it and it fades on out
[56:28] and he said that's the seventh seal it
[56:31] just ends the time for the world
[56:33] it ends the time for this it ends the
[56:35] time for that it ends the time for this
[56:37] it's the it ends the time everything
[56:40] just ended up
[56:41] on that seventh seal
[56:44] and christ the mystery of god reveal
[56:46] god's great mystery of how
[56:48] it's a secret he kept it secret nobody
[56:50] knows nothing about it even the angels
[56:52] didn't understand it seemed
[56:54] he didn't reveal it that's the reason
[56:56] under our seventh mystery when the
[56:58] seventh seal was opened there was
[56:59] silence jesus when he was on earth they
[57:02] wanted to know
[57:03] when he would come he said not even the
[57:05] son himself don't even know when it's
[57:07] going to happen see
[57:08] god has us all to himself it's a secret
[57:12] and that's the reason there was silence
[57:14] in heaven for the space of half an hour
[57:16] and seven thunders under their voices
[57:18] and and john was even forbidden to ride
[57:20] and see
[57:21] the coming of the lord and that's one
[57:24] thing he hasn't revealed yet of how
[57:26] he will come and when he will come it's
[57:28] a good thing that he does him
[57:30] but he says he's re he showed it or
[57:32] revealed it in every top
[57:34] that's in the bible therefore the entire
[57:36] bible is the revelation
[57:39] of god's mystery in christ so we see the
[57:42] seventh seal
[57:43] this is coming it's the coming of the
[57:46] lord
[57:46] and it goes on that no man knows the day
[57:49] nor the hour we know that he comes
[57:51] as a thief unto that to in the night
[57:54] and then he comes to those that are
[57:56] looking for him
[57:57] and then jesus asked the question will i
[58:00] find
[58:00] faith when i return will i will i find
[58:03] those that have stayed
[58:04] true to my word true to me
[58:09] amen i mean he's not going to be able to
[58:11] show us the exact day because if
[58:13] we knew the exact day we'd put it off
[58:15] because that's the human thing
[58:17] amen by this bride amen stays ready she
[58:20] has made herself ready
[58:23] amen we're living in the season of
[58:25] fulfillment amen
[58:27] and you've heard these things before but
[58:29] the day amen we're living in the day
[58:31] when the very back part of god's mind
[58:33] has been shown
[58:34] his very purpose through the ages and
[58:36] what god has been trying to accomplish
[58:39] amen you have an understanding amen
[58:43] god's mercy has been extended to you we
[58:46] understand that the sixth seal is
[58:47] tribulation
[58:49] and we clearly see we clearly see how
[58:52] that is coming upon the earth
[58:53] we see the signs we see the effects of
[58:56] it being shown
[58:58] we see the people getting in the spirit
[59:00] of destruction
[59:02] and then you see it even even more
[59:03] evidently and brother ram said
[59:05] it come to a place it was total insanity
[59:08] the people would lose their minds
[59:09] i mean they don't they don't understand
[59:11] what's wrong they don't understand
[59:13] what's right
[59:14] they can't discern between right and
[59:16] wrong and that's
[59:17] the faculty that's the mental faculty of
[59:19] the people that you and i live in
[59:21] they have no understanding oh be
[59:24] thankful this morning
[59:25] if i can make that clear to you be
[59:27] thankful this morning amen that you have
[59:29] an
[59:29] understanding of the hour that we live
[59:31] in amen that you've you've accepted
[59:33] god's mercy
[59:35] and you're preparing yourself you're
[59:38] making yourself ready
[59:42] we know that the seventh seal is the
[59:43] coming of the lord
[59:45] we also see the effects of it amen we
[59:48] see the effects of the opening of the
[59:50] word in our day how it's affected our
[59:52] lives
[59:52] amen how we walk differently than the
[59:55] world and the religious world
[59:57] amen we know amen we understand amen we
[1:00:00] see the time that we live in
[1:00:04] amen amen
[1:00:08] well we know that he was solid in that
[1:00:10] seventh seal and i'm no teacher i don't
[1:00:11] even know why i'm getting into this
[1:00:14] i know very little there's brothers that
[1:00:16] know way more than me i know nothing but
[1:00:18] these are just things that i had
[1:00:20] that were in front of me we know that
[1:00:23] the coming of the lord we know that
[1:00:24] the father only knows the day and the
[1:00:27] hour
[1:00:28] is that right and we know that brother
[1:00:30] said it's been revealed in every type
[1:00:32] through through lives and people through
[1:00:34] the scripture he revealed his coming
[1:00:36] he revealed amen amen they that he was
[1:00:39] going to come again
[1:00:40] amen he's revealed it in every top in
[1:00:42] the scripture amen and he's revealing it
[1:00:44] in you and me
[1:00:45] he's revealing his coming in you and me
[1:00:48] amen we're the final voice
[1:00:49] to the final age amen he's making
[1:00:51] himself known
[1:00:52] here to his people amen he's making
[1:00:54] himself known amen by saving us from our
[1:00:57] sins
[1:00:58] amen amen sanctifying our lives and then
[1:01:00] performing his word and you and i
[1:01:02] amen filling us with the holy ghost amen
[1:01:05] bringing us to a spot amen amen in his
[1:01:08] grace in you and i
[1:01:09] it's mercy and you and i and man
[1:01:11] bringing us to a spot
[1:01:12] sealing us with the holy ghost and then
[1:01:14] sealing the devil out
[1:01:16] and sealing himself in and then we see
[1:01:18] manifesting himself
[1:01:19] among his people appearing among us
[1:01:24] amen no though we all always don't
[1:01:26] always feel his presence
[1:01:28] amen but amen but we got to walk by
[1:01:30] faith
[1:01:31] amen jesus didn't say did you feel it
[1:01:33] but did you believe it
[1:01:34] amen he said will i find faith when i
[1:01:37] return not
[1:01:38] not will i find an emotional people that
[1:01:40] that just thrive on emotion
[1:01:42] but will i find faith will i find a
[1:01:44] people that are anchored
[1:01:45] amen that are steady amen amen but he
[1:01:49] comes by
[1:01:50] amen among us appearing among us amen
[1:01:53] with his presence
[1:01:54] amen and when he comes by it doesn't
[1:01:56] happen every service
[1:01:57] amen you don't feel it every service
[1:01:59] amen but he kind of lets you know every
[1:02:01] now and then
[1:02:02] and when he appears among you you feel
[1:02:04] his presence sweep in
[1:02:05] and then the preacher comes and preaches
[1:02:07] something and it speaks to your heart
[1:02:09] and man he's appearing to you and then
[1:02:11] he's showing you that he's here
[1:02:13] and then he comes and discerns your
[1:02:15] thoughts and your intents
[1:02:16] and when the preacher didn't know
[1:02:17] nothing about it the deacon didn't know
[1:02:19] nothing
[1:02:20] about it mama didn't know nothing about
[1:02:22] it amen but god
[1:02:23] spoke to those people he came and
[1:02:25] discerned your
[1:02:26] your thoughts letting you know that he
[1:02:30] cares about you
[1:02:31] amen he came and he called out your sin
[1:02:34] and then he cut
[1:02:34] he didn't let you continue on and you're
[1:02:36] wrong can you say amen this morning god
[1:02:38] won't let us get by with nothing

[1:02:49] his family is that right
[1:02:53] amen he's appearing among us the signs
[1:02:56] of his presence
[1:02:57] amen manifesting his word
[1:03:00] amen not just an emotion but we see his
[1:03:03] word among us
[1:03:05] amen amen this morning
[1:03:09] amen the bride had made herself ready
[1:03:11] amen we're a people praying
[1:03:13] praying watching waiting we see the hour

[1:03:18] amen we're living in the final age and
[1:03:20] the grandest of all ages
[1:03:22] and then it's the ending of time and the
[1:03:24] blending in of eternity
[1:03:27] amen blending in amen time ending in
[1:03:30] eternity blending in amen
[1:03:34] we know that we also live in the most
[1:03:36] sinful age
[1:03:37] the powers of satan many times harder to
[1:03:39] fight against than it was
[1:03:41] in any other age it's the most deceiving
[1:03:43] age that there
[1:03:44] ever was that's the question this
[1:03:46] morning
[1:03:47] are you blending in with this world
[1:03:50] what are you blending in with or are you
[1:03:52] more wrapped up in this world and
[1:03:54] and letting the cares of god the the
[1:03:56] cares of this life rather
[1:03:58] take it out of you or are you becoming
[1:04:01] one with god's word for this hour
[1:04:03] and blending in with the place we're
[1:04:04] going you're going one place or the
[1:04:06] other
[1:04:07] you're not halfway or in between amen
[1:04:10] you're either becoming one with the word
[1:04:12] or you're taking on the judgments of
[1:04:14] this world
[1:04:18] brother branham says here he said people
[1:04:19] say look if they mention the word look
[1:04:21] means to pay attention to look up
[1:04:23] or to look at look out and god is saying
[1:04:27] here look unto me i am god
[1:04:29] and there is none other and he goes on
[1:04:32] and says i wonder
[1:04:33] in a time that we are living in now what
[1:04:35] could we look at
[1:04:36] that would be more solid than god and
[1:04:39] god is the word so

[1:08:49] attack
[1:08:50] amen it would always get messed up
[1:08:53] before he could carry out his attack
[1:08:55] it meant elisha the prophet would tell
[1:08:58] the king
[1:08:58] of israel his plans and the king of
[1:09:02] assyria
[1:09:03] thought is there a spy in the camp who
[1:09:05] who would do this
[1:09:06] amen to to you and i who who among us
[1:09:09] would
[1:09:09] would tell our secrets and one spoke up
[1:09:12] and said
[1:09:13] he was then told of the of the prophet
[1:09:15] elijah and how
[1:09:17] he could even hear what was spoken in
[1:09:19] the bed chamber
[1:09:22] so the king of assyria spent sent spies
[1:09:25] out to search
[1:09:26] where elisha was in second kings 6
[1:09:30] and 14 therefore sin he hit there are
[1:09:34] horses and chariots
[1:09:36] and a great host and they came by not
[1:09:38] and compassed the city about
[1:09:40] and when the servant of the man of god
[1:09:42] was risen early and gone forth
[1:09:44] beholden hosts can pass the city both
[1:09:47] with horses and chariots
[1:09:49] and his servant said unto him at last my
[1:09:51] master how
[1:09:52] shall we do and he answered fear not
[1:09:56] for they that be with us are more or
[1:09:59] more than they that be with him
[1:10:01] and elisha prayed and said lord i pray
[1:10:03] thee open his eyes that he may see
[1:10:05] and the lord opened the eyes of the
[1:10:07] young man and he saw
[1:10:09] and behold the mountain was full of
[1:10:11] horses and chariots of fire
[1:10:13] round about elisha
[1:10:16] amen amen we could echo that this
[1:10:19] morning
[1:10:20] amen there's more with us than against
[1:10:22] us amen and brother branham says there's
[1:10:24] sometimes there is things happening
[1:10:26] around us that we cannot understand
[1:10:28] others are saying they can't
[1:10:30] they they see things and others see
[1:10:32] nothing about it
[1:10:33] but it depends on what you're looking at
[1:10:35] it depends on if you're understanding
[1:10:38] i mean if you're if your spiritual
[1:10:40] vision has been open
[1:10:41] or if you're just looking at the natural
[1:10:43] things around you looking at the chaos
[1:10:46] looking at the situation look at how bad
[1:10:48] it could be
[1:10:49] but if your eyes could be open you would
[1:10:51] see that god's with you
[1:10:53] you see that there's an innumerable
[1:10:54] company of angels with you
[1:10:56] and that god is watching over you
[1:10:58] keeping you safe
[1:10:59] working everything for your good amen
[1:11:02] he's a supernatural god
[1:11:04] he's beyond this human element amen that
[1:11:06] we sometimes
[1:11:07] so depend on amen god is beyond that
[1:11:10] amen our supernatural the supernatural
[1:11:13] god that we serve
[1:11:14] is beyond that amen he's a waymaker this
[1:11:17] morning
[1:11:18] i mean it's a miracle working god amen
[1:11:20] working his will
[1:11:22] in you and i working all things for our
[1:11:24] good amen making a way
[1:11:26] when there is no way
[1:11:31] brother branham says here you see elisha
[1:11:32] when he rose up he looked he saw
[1:11:34] something that
[1:11:35] hazel didn't see and so he prayed god
[1:11:37] opened this young man's eyes and now his
[1:11:39] eyes were wide open
[1:11:41] he said but he said open his eyes that
[1:11:42] he might see
[1:11:44] and when his eyes when his eyes
[1:11:46] spiritually came open
[1:11:47] the whole mountain was full of chariots
[1:11:49] fire and angels and all
[1:11:51] all around the prophecy it was different
[1:11:53] when his eyes came
[1:11:54] open and he said now people look at the
[1:11:57] word literally
[1:11:58] he said and that's the way you're
[1:11:59] supposed to look at it but it declares
[1:12:01] itself
[1:12:01] both literally and spiritually and the
[1:12:04] spirit makes the word
[1:12:05] live the promise amen your own
[1:12:09] understanding your own vision will only
[1:12:11] take you so far
[1:12:12] amen but it takes the mind of christ it
[1:12:15] takes something supernatural
[1:12:17] amen for us to be able to to really have
[1:12:19] faith amen to be able to understand
[1:12:21] and know what is around us
[1:12:25] amen you love the lord this morning
[1:12:32] that's the question what do you what do
[1:12:33] you see today what do you see
[1:12:36] this morning do you see us as a defeated
[1:12:39] people
[1:12:40] amen do you see our god as a god of
[1:12:43] history
[1:12:44] amen if that's what you're looking for
[1:12:46] if that's what your expectation is
[1:12:47] that's what you're going to see and what
[1:12:49] what you're looking for
[1:12:51] amen what what you see is is what your
[1:12:53] expectation is
[1:12:55] amen what what you seek god to be what
[1:12:57] you know god to be
[1:12:58] that ought to be our expectation amen
[1:13:01] that this morning god's my healer
[1:13:03] and that this morning there's no disease
[1:13:05] there's no sickness
[1:13:06] too greater from through great for my
[1:13:08] god
[1:13:12] amen it depends on what you're looking
[1:13:14] at is he some god of history
[1:13:16] is he a god of of just william branham's
[1:13:19] day or is he still god today
[1:13:21] you understand amen and we can look back
[1:13:24] at those things and
[1:13:25] and draw faith and and see what god what
[1:13:28] god was doing
[1:13:29] amen amen when brother branham left the
[1:13:32] scene god
[1:13:33] didn't leave his people he's still here
[1:13:34] with us in the midst
[1:13:36] of his people amen
[1:13:39] brother brennan would say in a message
[1:13:40] who is god he said the jehovah of the
