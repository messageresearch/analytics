[32:05] here for us that'll be all the music
[32:06] thank you for that
[32:07] amen it's good to be in the house of the
[32:09] lord when he started talking about a
[32:10] donkey i almost come out right then
[32:18] i can't get too mad at him i get on him
[32:20] pretty good so
[32:21] i guess that's
[32:23] he probably owed that to me
[32:24] and if you could take your bibles and we
[32:26] could turn
[32:27] turn with me to romans chapter four
[32:30] let's start with verse 19.
[32:33] i mean god been good to you today
[32:35] i'll try not to hold you long i know
[32:37] that's probably a lie but i'll try not
[32:39] to
[32:41] my last name is pruitt
[32:43] so it comes natural but i try my best to
[32:45] let you out early today
[32:48] 4 19 and he says this and being not weak
[32:50] in faith he considered not his own body
[32:53] now dead
[32:54] when he was about a hundred years old
[32:56] neither yet the deadness of sarah's womb
[32:58] he staggered not at the promise of god
[33:01] through unbelief but was strong in faith
[33:04] giving glory to god
[33:06] and being fully persuaded
[33:08] that what he had promised he was able to
[33:11] also perform
[33:13] and therefore it was imputed to him
[33:15] for righteousness now it was not written
[33:18] for his sake alone that it was imputed
[33:20] to him but for us
[33:22] also and i would like to think about
[33:24] that for just a moment if you would for
[33:26] us also it was imputed not just to
[33:28] abraham but to his seed
[33:30] and now was not written for his sake
[33:31] alone but also us now he says
[33:34] but for us also who believe if we
[33:36] believe on him that raised up jesus our
[33:38] lord from the dead
[33:39] who was delivered
[33:41] for our offenses and was raised again
[33:44] for our justification
[33:46] and over in if you would in second
[33:49] corinthians chapter 6
[33:51] verses 7 through 10
[33:54] by the word of truth by the power of god
[33:58] by the armor of righteousness on the
[34:01] right hand and on the left
[34:03] by honor and dishonor by evil report and
[34:05] good report
[34:06] as deceivers and yet true
[34:09] as unknown yet well known as dying and
[34:12] behold we live
[34:14] as chastened and not killed as sorrowful
[34:18] yet always rejoicing as poor
[34:21] yet making many rich
[34:23] as having nothing and yet possessing
[34:26] all things
[34:27] how many possessors do we have here
[34:29] tonight
[34:30] amen as abraham see we possess
[34:32] all things and you may be seated may the
[34:35] lord add his blessings to the reading of
[34:36] the word we'll read one more here
[34:39] genesis chapter 14. if you've got that
[34:41] he's talking about melchizedek here
[34:43] king of salem brought forth bread and
[34:45] wine and he was the priest of the most
[34:47] high god and he blessed him and said
[34:49] blessed be abram of the most high god
[34:52] possessor
[34:53] of heaven and earth and that word
[34:56] possess and possessing there is a
[34:59] present tense having and holding by an
[35:02] absolute right
[35:04] an absolute right or title occupying and
[35:08] enjoying
[35:10] think about that to occupy and to enjoy
[35:14] your inheritance
[35:15] and tonight if we could just speak for
[35:17] just a moment i would like to speak on
[35:19] the possessing all promises because we
[35:22] as seed of abraham as a spiritual seed
[35:24] of abraham as a royal seed we possess
[35:27] things that maybe we take for granted
[35:29] maybe we don't understand we we live so
[35:31] far below our privileges here that we
[35:34] don't see and we don't understand maybe
[35:36] just how important we are spiritually
[35:39] speaking and is the promise that we
[35:41] receive the seal of the promise is the
[35:43] baptism of the holy ghost for that is
[35:45] god in the form of spirit you being his
[35:48] word or he he being the word in you then
[35:51] he comes in if you receive the word in
[35:53] you that holy spirit is the only thing
[35:55] that can make that live the word live in
[35:57] you the promise in you and we possess
[36:00] the gate of every enemy the devil and
[36:03] all of his tactics we possess that we
[36:05] can overcome that by what the word and
[36:08] so we see here that god promised it and
[36:10] it is so and you can only do it then
[36:12] after being tested by the word remember
[36:15] abraham was tested by the word and if we
[36:18] being his seed we will also be tested by
[36:20] the word and but the faith of abraham
[36:23] remember it actually was stronger at the
[36:25] end of the 25 years than at the
[36:27] beginning of the 25 years why because he
[36:29] he became stronger and stronger in faith
[36:31] and i believe tonight that the seed of
[36:33] abraham will be the same way
[36:35] no matter how long it takes to get what
[36:37] we want from god we we will become
[36:40] stronger in our faith and i believe
[36:42] that's the way it is tonight the true
[36:43] believer is cast out from among the
[36:45] people sometimes we're called fanatics
[36:47] and holy rollers and so forth but the
[36:49] meek shall inherit the earth is that
[36:52] right you being the meek now it doesn't
[36:53] matter if you're rich or poor by some
[36:56] standard you are meek and spirit maybe
[36:58] but the meeks shall inherit the earth
[37:00] and even the poorest christian in here
[37:02] the poorest the poorest person in in the
[37:05] natural sense if you look out here the
[37:07] earth you step on is your possession
[37:09] everything has been given to you and it
[37:11] doesn't matter necessarily what you
[37:13] drive or what you wear but it does
[37:15] matter if you possessed christ because
[37:18] once you take on christ you become the
[37:20] seed of abraham at that time and that is
[37:22] what we all must come into as a believer
[37:24] is to not stand back here and live so
[37:27] far below our privileges and say that we
[37:29] don't have anything or we can't possess
[37:31] anything but healing is yours it is the
[37:33] children's bread the seed of abraham
[37:35] could possess all things and why is that
[37:38] why do we why do we live so low is
[37:40] because we really don't know who we are
[37:41] and once you know who you are the seed
[37:43] of abraham then there's no trouble there
[37:45] to possess these things and we go on
[37:47] down it doesn't matter maybe you don't
[37:49] have the money to pay your rent next
[37:50] month and maybe you don't have the money
[37:52] to put shoes on your children's feet it
[37:53] doesn't matter really on that regard
[37:55] because you're still the seed of abraham
[37:57] you still have everything you need in
[38:00] christ and the meeks shall inherit the
[38:02] believer has a title abstract deed
[38:05] that's right by jesus christ he shall be
[38:07] the possessor of his entire universe
[38:10] brother branham said he was the
[38:12] he was the possessor of the entire
[38:13] universe think about that everything
[38:16] you think about this whole
[38:17] earth this whole universe the whole
[38:19] galaxy everything here is actually ours
[38:22] the people that have it now we see that
[38:24] satan is ruling this whole universe and
[38:26] everything is being run over by sin and
[38:28] discourse but you and i are the true
[38:30] possessors of all of it
[38:33] we go on here and how do you get how do
[38:35] you get the possession of this it's not
[38:37] something you necessarily do
[38:39] other than obey the word but it is an
[38:41] unmerited gift that god has given us and
[38:44] we say here everything is ours
[38:47] everything that we see is ours and satan
[38:49] will try to bluff you a little bit but
[38:50] you just say satan that's mine stay back
[38:53] possess it take it back from the devil
[38:56] it's yours anyway and you have a legal
[38:58] right to every blessing that god has
[39:00] ever had and if there was ever a
[39:02] blessing given to abraham you think
[39:03] about it he was giving it to his abraham
[39:05] walked out there and everything to the
[39:06] west and the east to the north and south
[39:08] and everything he could see every every
[39:10] bit of land he could see he said abraham
[39:11] it's all yours
[39:13] and your seed
[39:15] the scriptures here tell us it's not
[39:17] just imputed abraham but to you also
[39:20] and that's what paul was teaching us
[39:21] here and when brother branham came to
[39:23] came down here and he and he spoke on
[39:25] the earth
[39:26] and he was staying he was saying he was
[39:27] trying to show the people that the same
[39:29] god of abraham the same god of isaac was
[39:32] the same god of you and i
[39:33] because god doesn't change and his word
[39:35] don't change and when we walk on down
[39:38] through the scriptures here we realize
[39:39] that everything no matter how good you
[39:42] think you are you may not possess what
[39:44] you think you do or how bad you think
[39:46] you are maybe you possess more than you
[39:47] think you do
[39:48] and we get so carnal minded and we think
[39:50] about it in such a way that we miss the
[39:52] spiritual blessings of god because we
[39:54] think about it well maybe you wouldn't
[39:56] took a dna test and abraham wasn't there
[39:58] but you're still a son or daughter of
[40:00] abraham he's still your father
[40:02] just because you don't find it in the
[40:03] natural remember this is a spiritual
[40:05] seed in christ
[40:07] in christ is when you take on abraham's
[40:08] seed and that's when you can possess all
[40:11] things everything that we have need of
[40:13] can be possessed by the believer
[40:16] remember it is to occupy to enjoy
[40:20] we can have peace
[40:22] all these things are ours
[40:24] every bit of it and now if we get if we
[40:26] don't just get what we ask for
[40:27] spontaneously then sometimes our faith
[40:29] weakens that wasn't abraham abraham was
[40:32] not that way so i think maybe if we
[40:33] could just stop you know we pray for
[40:36] something
[40:37] and maybe god didn't say yes
[40:39] right away
[40:41] and we get scared
[40:43] maybe god is wanting to test your faith
[40:44] just a little bit
[40:46] maybe he does want you to have it but
[40:47] maybe he doesn't want you to have it
[40:48] right that minute just to see if you'll
[40:50] hold on just a little longer i remember
[40:52] praying and asking the lord you know if
[40:54] there was anything i could do and it
[40:56] took years before i ever actually heard
[40:58] back anything that was any substantial
[41:00] voice that i actually heard and i was
[41:02] sitting there and you know what my faith
[41:03] did weaken i wanted something i could
[41:05] touch or feel i wanted an emotion to
[41:07] come on me it's not always the emotion
[41:10] it's sometimes it's a still small voice
[41:12] and we miss it because we get so caught
[41:13] up in the things of the world we get so
[41:15] caught up in our daily lives that we
[41:17] miss the still small voice of god that
[41:19] tries to tell you what's yours and it's
[41:22] all right here in the bible if you just
[41:23] read it because everything that we need
[41:26] is a possession and every possession we
[41:27] need is ours
[41:29] it is ours god made a covenant with
[41:31] abraham and that covenant in that
[41:33] covenant he made with abraham remember
[41:35] he wasn't just making a covenant with
[41:37] abraham but his seed also it wasn't just
[41:39] isaac but in christ
[41:42] will thy seed be called in christ so
[41:44] once you take on the seed of christ
[41:46] you are an heir of all the spiritual
[41:48] blessings of god and so that's the thing
[41:51] right there if you don't ever come to
[41:52] christ if you don't ever accept what
[41:53] he's already done for you then sure
[41:55] you're not going to feel the blessings
[41:56] of god you're not going to feel anything
[41:58] good from god maybe you'll never
[41:59] experience the blessings of god in any
[42:01] way because you didn't take on the seed
[42:03] of god by accepting christ remember this
[42:06] is all free this is not something you
[42:07] have to buy this is not something you
[42:09] have to go out and seek necessarily
[42:11] because god already sought you out and
[42:12] then he put a desire in your heart so
[42:14] you could seek him and at that point
[42:16] then when you return to god and you say
[42:19] i i feel you and i know you're pulling
[42:21] in my heart strings then at that point
[42:24] then god has already done something in
[42:26] you it wasn't you saying i'm gonna go
[42:27] find god because i'm not good no god
[42:29] already sought you out and put that
[42:31] desire there before you had anything to
[42:33] do with it so it's all free the desire
[42:35] you have to be in church is from god the
[42:37] desire you have to do anything for the
[42:40] lord that is the desire from god and god
[42:42] put it there but remember satan will
[42:44] come in there and try to kill that joy
[42:46] he will try to kill that that that
[42:47] promise from you he'll try to make you
[42:49] think you're not good enough for the
[42:50] promise he'll try to make you think
[42:52] you're some little person and you're
[42:54] sitting in a small church in hardy
[42:55] arkansas and i'm not good enough or i'm
[42:57] not the biggest church of the message
[42:59] but i tell you right now you are still
[43:01] the royal seat of abraham
[43:03] you still have a place in god's economy
[43:05] no matter how little you are you say
[43:07] well my ministry's not this and it's not
[43:09] on this level maybe i don't have the
[43:10] voice to be this preacher or that
[43:12] preacher but you're still used of god
[43:14] because why god didn't say that
[43:16] everybody would be abraham and everybody
[43:18] be christ but in that sea line there
[43:20] will come forth a bride and there will
[43:22] be sons and daughters in that seed line
[43:24] there and that's where we need to come
[43:25] to when we think about these promises
[43:27] what promises are ours mark 16 and 17 he
[43:31] said these signs shall follow them that
[43:32] believe in my name they shall cast out
[43:34] devils they shall speak with tongues
[43:36] they shall do these things why that is
[43:38] the promise acts 2 38 repent and be
[43:40] baptized in the name of jesus christ and
[43:42] you shall that's a promise you shall
[43:44] receive the gift of the holy ghost that
[43:46] is a promise to you and to your children
[43:49] that's still a promise no matter how bad
[43:51] it looks and how far your children are
[43:53] away from you god is still god and his
[43:55] promises are still true regardless
[43:58] if you think about it that way
[44:00] god won't lose one of his
[44:03] every promise is still yours every
[44:05] promise in this bible is still
[44:07] absolutely the truth
[44:09] god doesn't take away
[44:10] a promise and god doesn't take he's not
[44:13] an indian giver he doesn't give you
[44:14] something and give something to abraham
[44:16] and give something to isaac and then
[44:18] well you're the same seed but i've taken
[44:20] it from you i've taken your inheritance
[44:21] no it's still your inheritance
[44:24] when the prodigal son left
[44:26] he was still a son
[44:28] just because he strayed didn't make him
[44:29] any less of a son and i say tonight if
[44:32] you strayed if you fell apart and your
[44:34] life looks like it's in ruins you're
[44:36] still a son or daughter of god
[44:38] has nothing to do with the circumstances
[44:40] abraham looked at the circumstances it
[44:41] would have told him to quit believing
[44:43] but because he quit looking at the
[44:44] circumstances and he saw that god was
[44:46] still god and he believed anyway and his
[44:49] seed will do the same thing
[44:51] i'll tell you sometimes in my life i
[44:53] thought i was so far gone i thought i
[44:54] couldn't be saved i thought maybe i'd
[44:56] went too far i'd crossed the line but
[44:58] there was something on the inside that
[45:00] said come back home and when i responded
[45:02] to that call i knew there was still
[45:05] something in me i knew i was still seen
[45:08] because god is not just a god afar off
[45:11] but he's a god right here and he'll
[45:13] speak to you sometimes in ways that you
[45:15] don't think he'll speak to you he might
[45:17] use a donkey to speak to you
[45:19] but god will still speak god is still
[45:21] god
[45:22] his seed is still his seed everything
[45:26] god placed in the church every promise
[45:27] that he ever placed in the church is
[45:28] still active tonight
[45:30] it's still a true promise of god
[45:33] when we come in when the satan comes in
[45:35] like a flood god will raise up a
[45:36] standard what is the standard
[45:38] we are
[45:39] the standard he'll raise up
[45:41] think about we are that seed of abraham
[45:43] they come right on down through christ
[45:45] and then christ into the church
[45:47] christ in you
[45:48] and now you
[45:50] through christ are the standard for the
[45:52] age
[45:53] and when you think about it in that way
[45:55] then we think we don't nothing satan can
[45:57] come against us but in that way we are
[45:59] more than able to withstand every gate
[46:03] of every enemy
[46:04] any time
[46:06] any place
[46:07] satan may come at you he may tell you
[46:09] this he may say you know what you have
[46:12] no talents you are no good and you're
[46:14] not going to help the church you might
[46:15] as well stay home you might as well do
[46:17] whatever you want to do but if god has
[46:19] placed you in a body stay there and stay
[46:22] faithful to it and do what you can for
[46:24] god and if you really have that call of
[46:26] god in your life god won't even let you
[46:29] sit at home because listen brother
[46:30] branham says it like this if god is in
[46:32] your heart
[46:34] you can't wait for them doors to open
[46:36] so it's not you going to church it's not
[46:38] you dragging yourself to church it's god
[46:40] taking you to church
[46:42] think about it like this if you knew god
[46:44] was going to church with you every
[46:45] sunday would you go
[46:47] he is
[46:48] he is the very desire that makes you go
[46:51] he's the very desire in your heart that
[46:53] makes you love somebody
[46:54] that love is not just an emotion it is a
[46:56] desire and these things this possession
[46:59] that we have is not just a story but it
[47:01] is an actual fact it is something you
[47:03] can actually have and this is something
[47:05] that when you come down and you look at
[47:07] and you look through the ages and you
[47:08] see what god did to the church and you
[47:10] see what he did to abraham there and how
[47:12] he blessed him but you think about it
[47:13] that's a good story and it's true and it
[47:15] really happened but it's you too
[47:18] god has spoken to every one of you that
[47:20] you are the royal seed of abraham
[47:23] you are blessed among all the peoples of
[47:25] the earth
[47:26] you are that royal scene
[47:29] when you're sick
[47:30] think about it
[47:31] god has already provided a sacrifice
[47:33] just like he did for abraham
[47:35] the same god the same way he's already
[47:39] got a ram and the thicket for you
[47:41] because when somebody's in the hospital
[47:43] on their deathbed and you think well
[47:45] that's just the end of it no that's just
[47:46] the beginning of it
[47:47] god can god can in the instant like that
[47:50] provide a ram and you can be like you
[47:52] see these healings take place and you
[47:54] see surgeries that maybe a person should
[47:56] die and they come through them and they
[47:57] actually survive these things and why
[47:59] because god has a purpose for these
[48:01] things god has a reason behind it
[48:04] nothing happens by chance but to the
[48:06] royal seat of abraham god has already
[48:08] seen what he's done for one and
[48:10] everything that he did for abraham he's
[48:12] still going to do for you right here
[48:14] tonight i believe that we we sometimes
[48:17] healing passes by because we think we're
[48:19] not worthy of it but i i'll tell you
[48:20] tonight it's not your worthiness anyway
[48:23] but it's god himself that come down and
[48:25] gave you an abstract deed and i'll tell
[48:27] you what if god if somebody gave me a
[48:30] title to a vehicle and they said it's
[48:32] yours and they signed their name on it
[48:33] i'm going to go take it down i'm going
[48:35] to register it i'm going to claim it is
[48:36] mine and i'll tell you tonight when god
[48:38] came down and he gave you an abstract
[48:40] deed and he said it's all yours every
[48:43] promise in the book is yours everything
[48:45] you have need of every child that you
[48:47] have is not going to be lost every
[48:49] brother and sister that's out there in
[48:51] the world they're not going to be lost
[48:52] everyone that looks like it but if you
[48:54] have the faith of abraham he won't lose
[48:57] one of them
[48:59] you say well job lost all of them he was
[49:01] a perfect man but god gave him all back
[49:03] to him
[49:04] everything will be restored to you
[49:07] all these promises are yours
[49:10] everything is yours and abraham
[49:12] staggered not
[49:13] at the promises of god i wonder if we
[49:16] could get to a place like that ourselves
[49:18] but see humanity gets in our way and we
[49:21] start thinking about we start thinking
[49:22] about women the life that i have
[49:24] the cards i've been dealt
[49:26] and many times it's bad and i remember
[49:28] thinking as a young person i thought man
[49:30] i don't want to be living in the
[49:31] situation i'm living in and i you know a
[49:33] lot of times we make our situations
[49:35] worse by trying to fix things ourselves
[49:37] if we would ever get down on our knees
[49:38] and pray study the word of god a lot of
[49:40] times the answers are right here in
[49:42] front of us and we fail to grab a hold
[49:44] of them
[49:45] and that's the problem we run into but i
[49:47] tell you tonight church there is a
[49:49] positive gospel to the seed of abraham
[49:52] listen to the denominations to the world
[49:56] there's all kinds of doom and gloom for
[49:57] them and rightfully so but to you
[50:01] this this this thing that's going to
[50:02] come upon the earth
[50:04] all the bombs and things that's going to
[50:05] hit that's not on you you have nothing
[50:07] to be scared of
[50:09] because your abraham's seed and you've
[50:11] already been called out from among that
[50:13] and i believe tonight if we could ever
[50:16] think really hard about who we are and
[50:18] take the word of god and just believe
[50:20] for it we would quit worrying about the
[50:22] gas prices we quit worrying about the
[50:24] economy and who's president we would be
[50:27] we would quit thinking about all that
[50:28] because god's got it all in control
[50:30] anyway
[50:31] i'm not saying you got to vote for one
[50:33] or the other what i'm saying is quit
[50:34] worrying about who's there because if
[50:36] you really believe the prophet of god
[50:37] the system is crooked anyway so they're
[50:39] going to put in who they want to put in
[50:41] and so i'll say it this way we we spend
[50:43] so much time worrying about it it
[50:45] becomes a distraction to your christian
[50:47] walk and it becomes a place where all
[50:49] you can think about is the doom and
[50:50] gloom of the world when that worldly
[50:52] doom and gloom is not yours anyway but
[50:54] the promises is what you should think
[50:56] about because that is yours
[50:58] the inheritance is yours
[51:01] the things that we think so much about
[51:03] the world and it happens to all of us we
[51:05] think well you know
[51:06] this so-and-so is president you know
[51:08] groceries are going up gas is going up
[51:10] they're going to bomb us there's no
[51:12] leadership in the white house there's no
[51:13] leadership well i'll be honest with you
[51:15] there's no leadership there anyway
[51:16] because really there's puppet strings
[51:18] pulling everything but i'll say this
[51:20] here there's a god who's actually in
[51:22] control of all of it
[51:23] and he knows exactly who will be there
[51:25] on the next term and the term after that
[51:27] if the lord tarries he knows who's going
[51:29] to be there so the bride has nothing to
[51:31] worry about
[51:33] sickness is going to strike you at some
[51:35] point if the lord terrorists you're
[51:37] going to die with something why worry
[51:39] about it and start the process now
[51:43] let's just keep it let's just put it off
[51:44] a little longer
[51:46] to worry
[51:47] is it there there's nothing brother
[51:48] brandon i heard this on the tape today
[51:50] he said there's no merit in worry
[51:53] there's no healing in worry
[51:55] nothing we worry about things we have no
[51:57] control over and we start getting
[51:59] ourselves all worked up into a frantic
[52:01] emotion about the way the world is when
[52:03] the world don't belong to us but the
[52:05] whole entire universe does this world as
[52:08] we know it is chaos
[52:10] but there is another world that will be
[52:11] set up here and that is ours
[52:13] there will be no sin
[52:14] there will be no bad presidents
[52:16] maybe not at all
[52:18] but there will be a god there
[52:20] who has already is already god here and
[52:23] when you can really get into the
[52:24] atmosphere of god you can realize that
[52:26] we have nothing to worry about even here
[52:29] even on this side before we ever get to
[52:31] the perfect place right here in the
[52:32] chaos we live in god has already given
[52:35] us reason enough
[52:37] to withstand the devil he's given us a
[52:39] sword he's given us the spirit of truth
[52:42] he's given us the message of the hour
[52:43] he's given us everything we need and all
[52:45] we have to do is grab a hold of it and
[52:47] accept it
[52:48] but what we do is worry and we fuss and
[52:51] we fight and we get into a state of
[52:53] panic because of the way the world is
[52:55] church i tell you quit worrying about it
[52:58] quit getting distracted by it it's not
[53:00] going to help you and i know the
[53:02] humanity comes in and it gets a hold of
[53:04] us all at times but i think that's a
[53:06] good time to get on your knees that's a
[53:08] good time to read the word of god that's
[53:10] a good night good time to turn on a tape
[53:13] and change the presence of god or bring
[53:15] the presence of god to you
[53:17] change the atmosphere
[53:19] turn on something good turn off the news
[53:21] maybe a little bit
[53:23] there's nothing good on it
[53:24] it'll depress you it will actually play
[53:26] with your emotions people don't like
[53:28] emotions in church but i'll say this
[53:30] you can listen to the radio and your
[53:32] emotions will change you can watch tv
[53:34] and your emotions will change you can
[53:36] watch a movie and it will play with your
[53:37] emotions that's what it does but i would
[53:39] just sure enough like the holy ghost to
[53:41] take control of my emotions
[53:43] won't hurt nobody
[53:44] amen
[53:46] i'd rather that than the movie stars
[53:48] change my emotions
[53:49] i'd rather that than cnn or fox or
[53:52] c-span or whoever else i'd much rather
[53:54] the holy ghost change my emotions than
[53:56] that
[53:57] i would much rather come to the house of
[54:00] god and feel an emotional presence and
[54:03] love among the people
[54:05] than to come in and amongst a bunch of
[54:07] people who are worried if they're going
[54:09] to go in the rapture am i going to make
[54:11] it am i going to go through the
[54:12] tribulation
[54:14] all these things i tell you what none of
[54:15] these things move me we'll just put it
[54:17] that way because when the when the flesh
[54:19] is all gone
[54:20] and this temporary house is gone there
[54:23] is another one already waiting for you
[54:24] regardless of the state of this one
[54:27] you think about this there's been people
[54:28] that have passed on that have been
[54:30] crippled and there's been people that
[54:31] have went to be with the lord who maybe
[54:33] they couldn't talk or maybe they
[54:34] couldn't see but this is only a
[54:36] temporary tabernacle and question was
[54:38] asked to me one time why would a good
[54:41] god allow these things to happen to good
[54:43] people
[54:44] but they're thinking in the carnal realm
[54:47] they're thinking in such a and this
[54:49] space of time that we live in is such a
[54:50] short time to god it's not like it seems
[54:52] to us and it's so short and fleeting and
[54:55] fast this is just a temporary tabernacle
[54:57] but see abraham's seed they're not just
[54:59] a possessor of this body in this life
[55:01] but you possess things even after this
[55:03] life why because you're more than just a
[55:06] human being you are a spirit of christ
[55:09] in you you are a little messiah you are
[55:12] a creator the atmosphere you have around
[55:14] you is created by you this the spirit
[55:17] you bring to church with you is an
[55:18] atmosphere you created and brought to
[55:20] church with you you can either come to
[55:22] church with god or you can come to
[55:24] church with a bad spirit the bad spirit
[55:26] is going to affect the people around you
[55:28] maybe unless they prayed through real
[55:30] well but i will say this that many times
[55:33] we think about ourselves so much how do
[55:36] i look when i come to church how are my
[55:37] kids going to act in church is anybody
[55:40] going to look at me wrong is anybody
[55:41] going to not shake my hand or shake my
[55:42] hand but listen the seed of abraham
[55:44] comes to hear the word they come to
[55:47] because there's a promise in the word to
[55:49] them and when i know in my heart that
[55:51] there's a promise somebody has got a has
[55:53] promised me a lifetime
[55:56] supply
[55:57] of norwex
[55:58] or something
[55:59] all this other you know this the sales
[56:01] marketing some somebody's promised me a
[56:03] lifetime supply then i expect to get it
[56:04] in the mail every month or get my
[56:06] subscription or whatever i expect it
[56:09] but what about a promise of god
[56:12] that he that will heal all your diseases
[56:15] do you expect it to happen
[56:17] do you expect it or do you think it
[56:20] maybe it'll happen
[56:21] maybe it won't happen
[56:23] if abraham would have had that kind of
[56:25] faith he would have never taken isaac up
[56:26] in the first place to the altar
[56:28] never would have taken him because in
[56:30] that kind of faith you're getting up
[56:31] there and you think well maybe god won't
[56:33] provide iran maybe god won't do anything
[56:35] maybe but abraham knew that even
[56:38] if
[56:39] he died
[56:41] then even in death
[56:43] god could raise up another
[56:46] you imagine if you waited 25 years for
[56:48] your firstborn child and god told you to
[56:50] go take his life
[56:52] could we do it
[56:54] that's hard
[56:56] but that's where our faith
[56:58] has to go that's the trust we have to
[57:00] have
[57:01] in a living god
[57:03] it's not a god of yesterday he's not a
[57:05] god of abraham and moses and those he is
[57:07] a god of those but he's not just a god
[57:09] of that day he's not just a god that
[57:11] walked on earth 2000 years ago but he's
[57:13] also a god of now
[57:15] and he's the same god people try to put
[57:16] it back with brother branham and that's
[57:18] wonderful we see that god was used in
[57:19] brother branham's ministry but that same
[57:21] god using brother brandon's ministry can
[57:23] be used through little old you because
[57:25] you say well i don't have the sign in my
[57:26] hand and i don't have the gift of the
[57:28] visions and i don't have these things
[57:30] but you're still
[57:31] a seed of abraham
[57:34] there's not one seed listen there's not
[57:36] one seed
[57:38] that is greater than the other seed in
[57:40] that line
[57:41] because if i am a pruitt and he is a
[57:44] pruitt
[57:45] i am just as good as he is
[57:48] maybe i can't preach like him but i can
[57:50] still
[57:51] i'm still i still have the same rights
[57:55] to the same family history
[57:57] we have the same problems because of who
[57:59] we are
[58:01] but let me tell you like this
[58:03] you
[58:04] are just like isaac
[58:06] just like isaac everything that abraham
[58:09] promised to his son that's you
[58:11] you daughters of abraham you sons of
[58:13] abraham i think it's time we take back
[58:15] our blessings
[58:17] take back your joy
[58:19] take back your praise don't let nobody
[58:21] steal it from you
[58:22] don't let nobody take it from you you
[58:25] say but everything looks like it's
[58:26] falling apart
[58:27] just a little bit longer and it'll all
[58:30] be made new
[58:31] just a little bit longer and all the
[58:33] wrongs will be made right the crooked
[58:35] places will be made straight the message
[58:37] we have is a message of restoration and
[58:40] it came and he said i will restore all
[58:43] things i will restore all things back
[58:46] abraham's seed is here again and we
[58:48] still have the blessings of god
[58:50] we're still sons of abraham
[58:54] the power is still in the church
[58:57] satan is only a bluff
[58:59] we've got to step out on faith we've got
[59:02] to believe the word of god we've got to
[59:04] get to a point where we put down our
[59:06] doubts
[59:07] cast down reasoning
[59:09] realize who we are in god's economy
[59:12] because we're going to have in this life
[59:14] we're going to have troubles we're going
[59:15] to have all kinds of temptations we're
[59:17] going to have things in his flesh this
[59:18] flesh this flesh is never sanctified
[59:20] this flesh is never saved but there is a
[59:22] spirit man in here that is in christ and
[59:24] that person is
[59:27] saved
[59:28] so no matter what happens here
[59:30] if you die tomorrow of a heart attack
[59:33] if you're in christ
[59:35] you don't really die
[59:37] and when you realize that you have an
[59:38] eternal life an eternal being that's not
[59:40] the one you see here but it's the one on
[59:42] the inside and that inside man will
[59:44] become so big
[59:46] that the outside man will try to cut you
[59:48] will actually come under subjection to
[59:50] that man in a sense it'll fight it's the
[59:53] black dog and it's the white dog and
[59:54] they will always fight and they will
[59:56] they will always be there but in this
[59:57] sense right here there is a spirit man
[59:59] and if you feed that spirit man daily
[1:00:02] he will live and he will grow stronger
[1:00:05] and greater but if you always pull back
[1:00:08] and you quit reading your bible and you
[1:00:10] quit hearing the message of the hour and
[1:00:11] you do these things and you expect to
[1:00:13] live a christian life in a victorious
[1:00:15] life then you're missing it because when
[1:00:17] you feed the black man and your eyes
[1:00:20] excuse me your eyes are always glued to
[1:00:22] the tv and you're always thinking about
[1:00:24] things like this let me tell you this
[1:00:26] that black man will get bigger and
[1:00:28] bigger and the white man will get
[1:00:30] smaller and that spirit will get smaller
[1:00:32] but when you think about this one right
[1:00:34] here when you think about the spirit
[1:00:35] that's in you that will glow and grow
[1:00:38] because you have to feed it on god's
[1:00:40] things you have to get that thing fed
[1:00:42] daily if i went on a diet which i have
[1:00:45] and my brother did too i've lost weight
[1:00:47] he hasn't
[1:00:49] but when you go on a diet you can skip a
[1:00:52] meal here and there you can do different
[1:00:53] things and all that but if you do the
[1:00:56] same thing
[1:00:58] with your spiritual diet
[1:01:01] you're also going to lose
[1:01:03] some weight in that area
[1:01:05] and that sounds simple and it is but
[1:01:07] think about it like this
[1:01:09] if i feed if i can if i just say i'm not
[1:01:12] going to eat no more
[1:01:13] i'm not going to drink no more water
[1:01:15] i'm not going to feed myself anymore i'm
[1:01:18] going to die pretty soon you can only
[1:01:20] live so long without food and water
[1:01:22] when you do that to your spiritual life
[1:01:24] and you expect to be alive when you come
[1:01:26] to church you expect to be alive when it
[1:01:28] comes time of death
[1:01:30] you're really going to die then
[1:01:31] but if you fed your spiritual man when
[1:01:33] it comes down to the river and it's time
[1:01:34] to die you don't actually die
[1:01:37] that spiritual man has been fed so well
[1:01:40] you just step into another body
[1:01:42] and when we can feed our spiritual man
[1:01:44] like that
[1:01:45] we can feed him just as well as we do
[1:01:46] our natural flesh
[1:01:49] we can get nice and fat on the natural
[1:01:51] but can we do the same in the spiritual
[1:01:53] can we really feed ourselves i wonder if
[1:01:55] we read our bible three times a day how
[1:01:57] we do
[1:01:58] i wonder if we heard two or three tapes
[1:02:00] a day how we would act at church because
[1:02:02] this is not a dead letter this is not a
[1:02:04] dead message this is alive it is a real
[1:02:07] living thing that god has sent to us and
[1:02:09] when you have a living being inside of
[1:02:11] you and you have a living god that is
[1:02:13] feeding you then really really what you
[1:02:14] grab a hold of is not something that's
[1:02:16] dead not not word only but in the spirit
[1:02:19] also and when you see a man of god maybe
[1:02:21] that has fallen back and they get into a
[1:02:23] spot to where everything's dead and dry
[1:02:25] and they don't believe in the spirit or
[1:02:26] no emotion in the church that's whatever
[1:02:28] people can do what they want to do but
[1:02:30] let me tell you this you have starved
[1:02:32] out your spiritual being you have gotten
[1:02:34] to a point to where you don't really
[1:02:35] believe who you are because if i believe
[1:02:38] that i'm a spiritual seed of abraham
[1:02:40] then what i really believe is this that
[1:02:42] i've already inherited everything and
[1:02:44] now it's time for me to go and tend to
[1:02:46] it i've already inherited the blessings
[1:02:48] of god but i'm going to water it i'm
[1:02:50] going to feed it if i don't really
[1:02:52] believe i have that vehicle that someone
[1:02:53] has given to me then i think of it like
[1:02:55] this i'm never going to put gas in it
[1:02:57] i'm never going to go claim it and put
[1:02:58] tags on it because i don't really
[1:03:00] believe it's mine there's got to be a
[1:03:02] catch to it and maybe somebody thinks
[1:03:04] there's a catch to the blessings of god
[1:03:06] but there's no catch to it it is yours
[1:03:10] it is every bit yours the same it was
[1:03:13] abrahams
[1:03:14] you get to the point
[1:03:17] that you really believe that
[1:03:19] that the possession is yours you can
[1:03:22] enjoy it
[1:03:23] because to possess is to enjoy
[1:03:25] you can have or you can hold it
[1:03:27] with absolute
[1:03:29] title deed
[1:03:31] absolutely
[1:03:32] everything is yours a lot of times
[1:03:35] happiness is is not a something we wake
[1:03:37] up with right because we think about the
[1:03:40] things that are distracting us we think
[1:03:41] about work we think about lack of money
[1:03:43] we think about a car that maybe broke
[1:03:45] down or maybe our lack of transportation
[1:03:47] there are many things in this life
[1:03:49] that's going to go wrong but the facts
[1:03:50] are when you can really look up and see
[1:03:52] like you said where the apple's falling
[1:03:54] from
[1:03:55] you can ask god for it and god can still
[1:03:58] provide what you have need of
[1:04:01] just because you lack in this life
[1:04:03] doesn't mean you'll always lack in this
[1:04:05] life maybe god is putting you through a
[1:04:07] test maybe god is allowing something to
[1:04:09] happen so that god can really use you
[1:04:12] in a spiritual way maybe he is allowing
[1:04:15] temptations to come upon you to see if
[1:04:16] you can withstand them and maybe god is
[1:04:18] allowing things to happen like he did
[1:04:20] job go ahead satan take him but you
[1:04:22] can't touch his life
[1:04:24] and that is the same way of us satan has
[1:04:26] nothing to do with when you die
[1:04:28] god already knows
[1:04:30] to a true believer
[1:04:32] god knows the beginning from the end and
[1:04:34] when you take on christ and his word
[1:04:38] we are the royal seed we are absolutely
[1:04:41] one
[1:04:42] with christ
[1:04:44] because in christ is when you take on
[1:04:46] the royal sea and i'll try to quit i see
[1:04:48] my time's getting away from me i hope
[1:04:50] that clock is right not an hour behind
[1:04:52] oh my goodness but we need a reminder
[1:04:54] sometimes of who we are we do need a
[1:04:57] reminder sometimes that we are still the
[1:04:59] royal seat of abraham
[1:05:01] we are still
[1:05:02] god's chosen people
[1:05:05] regardless of the politics regardless of
[1:05:07] anything you're still god's chosen
[1:05:09] people so when you can get past that
[1:05:12] it'll change your attitude and your
[1:05:14] atmosphere
[1:05:15] because you're always going to have the
[1:05:16] human side that's going to beat you down
[1:05:18] but just steal away and pray
[1:05:21] ask
[1:05:22] god
[1:05:23] to take that evil spirit off of you the
[1:05:25] spirit of depression
[1:05:27] the spirit of things that might grab a
[1:05:29] hold of you and drag you away from
[1:05:31] church the sickness that gets on your
[1:05:33] bodies god is still god
[1:05:36] and he's still more than able brother
[1:05:38] brahem says it like this whatsoever you
[1:05:40] ask in the father's name
[1:05:42] i'll do it every promise in the book
[1:05:45] belongs to you
[1:05:46] when you're saved he gives you a check
[1:05:49] with his name wrote at the bottom of it
[1:05:51] don't be afraid to fill it out because
[1:05:53] the bank of heaven will recognize it
[1:05:55] if it goes through the pentecostal
[1:05:57] clearinghouse
[1:05:58] he said that's right if you've got
[1:06:00] something here on deposit yourself
[1:06:03] if you're recognized if you've got
[1:06:05] identification to show that the check
[1:06:08] belongs to you it's only
[1:06:10] for believers now
[1:06:13] if you got that identification god will
[1:06:16] recognize your check that's right no
[1:06:18] matter what you ask for
[1:06:20] any redemptive blessing belongs to you
[1:06:24] if it was redeemed it belongs to you
[1:06:26] you already have a check written out
[1:06:29] abraham's seed is already written out on
[1:06:31] it
[1:06:32] all you have to do is cash the check
[1:06:35] cash the check for your children cash
[1:06:37] the check for your brothers and sisters
[1:06:39] cash the check for your spouse cash the
[1:06:42] check for something that went wrong in
[1:06:44] your life
[1:06:45] cash the check for depression
[1:06:47] if the news is bothering you turn it off
[1:06:49] and cash god's check turn on the news of
[1:06:52] heaven hear that voice calling out to
[1:06:54] you come out of her my people be not
[1:06:56] partakers of her plagues come on over
[1:06:58] here and enjoy the blessings of god
[1:07:01] come on over here where we're fed on the
[1:07:03] true things of god leave all those
[1:07:05] things in the past that are in the past
[1:07:07] and come forward and press on towards
[1:07:09] the mark
[1:07:10] that's what we have to do as believers
[1:07:13] is quit thinking about where we've been
[1:07:14] maybe so much and i was this and i was
[1:07:17] that it's a great testimony but there's
[1:07:19] more than that because we are now sons
[1:07:22] and daughters of god we are now the
[1:07:23] royal seat of abraham and so we get past
[1:07:26] that here we see that the the
[1:07:28] pentecostal clearinghouse is what casual
[1:07:30] clears that check and they look at it
[1:07:32] and they examine that check and we see
[1:07:34] here that on the bottom of this when it
[1:07:36] says it doesn't say joel pruitt because
[1:07:38] god will never recognize that maybe but
[1:07:40] he'll recognize this he'll recognize
[1:07:43] abraham's seed
[1:07:46] because we're all the one and the same
[1:07:48] not one of us or above another
[1:07:50] just the last name and excuse me for
[1:07:52] saying this i don't mean this is slander
[1:07:53] but the last name branham does not get
[1:07:55] you to heaven it does not give you any
[1:07:56] more power
[1:07:58] than a pruitt or a white or anybody else
[1:08:02] it's wonderful to be related maybe if i
[1:08:03] was a natural king son that would be
[1:08:05] wonderful and you could take some pride
[1:08:07] in that or maybe it would be maybe if i
[1:08:09] was a president a president's son maybe
[1:08:11] i could take some pride in that but
[1:08:13] there's one thing you have to remember
[1:08:15] you are actually greater
[1:08:17] than the leaders of this earth
[1:08:19] you're greater than the than the gods of
[1:08:21] this world you are more than able
[1:08:24] because you can withstand every power
[1:08:27] every temptation not your flesh but the
[1:08:29] god in you the creator has already put a
[1:08:32] seed in there and that seed has already
[1:08:34] brought forth life and now you are now
[1:08:36] sons and daughters of god and you are
[1:08:38] abraham's seed so you don't have to
[1:08:40] worry about anything
[1:08:41] we can get past the word
[1:08:43] get past all these things that hinder us
[1:08:46] nothing will separate us
[1:08:48] from the love of god that is in christ
[1:08:51] jesus nothing
[1:08:53] no politics no gas prices nothing but
[1:08:56] satan will try you in every way you know
[1:08:59] when satan when you realize one of
[1:09:01] satan's tactics
[1:09:03] and you start okay i can stand up
[1:09:05] against that one because i know satan's
[1:09:06] coming at me with a certain way he'll
[1:09:08] change his tactics and a lot of times
[1:09:10] that's how we get in a trap he quit
[1:09:12] trying to put the spirit of depression
[1:09:13] on you because you don't get depressed
[1:09:15] like you used to you're a happy child of
[1:09:18] god but then he'll bring over here and
[1:09:19] he'll make your best friend turn against
[1:09:21] you and he'll make you feel like you're
[1:09:23] no good and you're a bad friend and
[1:09:25] you're all this but listen satan is only
[1:09:27] using that to affect your spiritual walk
[1:09:30] he is trying to get you down he's trying
[1:09:32] to put a pothole in this road we're
[1:09:33] walking on but tonight church i believe
[1:09:36] that if we can ever get past
[1:09:38] this carnal flesh
[1:09:40] and you say it will always be here it
[1:09:42] will always be here it will always fight
[1:09:43] you but if you'll just feed
[1:09:46] that spirit man a little more we can
[1:09:48] overcome this
[1:09:50] we can absolutely overcome this would
[1:09:52] you stand with me as musicians come we
[1:09:54] are more
[1:09:56] than conquerors through christ that
[1:09:58] loved us
[1:09:59] we are more than able because we are the
[1:10:02] seed of abraham
[1:10:03] in christ and i know it's short and it's
[1:10:07] in his simple thought there today but i
[1:10:09] just want you to be encouraged
[1:10:11] that this world has nothing on you
[1:10:13] this flesh has nothing on you your
[1:10:16] family may look like it's in shambles it
[1:10:17] has nothing to do with your eternal
[1:10:20] destination
[1:10:21] nothing you're in now the situation
[1:10:23] you're in
[1:10:24] has nothing to do with where we're going
[1:10:27] we are the seed of abraham and just as
[1:10:31] isaac was called from abraham as the son
[1:10:33] of god you also
[1:10:34] are called a seed of abraham
[1:10:37] in abraham's seed
[1:10:39] the blessings of god still exist
[1:10:42] the word of god is still good to us
[1:10:45] because we believe everything that god
[1:10:46] promised for us
[1:10:48] i believe that god has something for
[1:10:50] every one of us today
[1:10:51] god has
[1:10:53] something
[1:10:54] that you can grab hold of there's a
[1:10:55] promise in your life and you know there
[1:10:57] are resources in heaven
[1:10:59] that we haven't even tapped into yet
[1:11:02] because we're down here living in this
[1:11:03] in this this world we live in with the
[1:11:05] distractions we have if we could ever
[1:11:07] just get past that
[1:11:09] we can really grab hold of the promises
[1:11:10] of god
[1:11:11] and we can say god
[1:11:13] i give this flesh to you
[1:11:15] and i give my life to you
[1:11:17] so that i can just make it a little
[1:11:20] closer i want to be just a little more
[1:11:22] like christ i want to walk just a little
[1:11:24] more in his love and kindness
[1:11:26] i want to be just like christ because in
[1:11:29] him
[1:11:30] i take on all the promises of abraham
[1:11:32] seed
[1:11:33] do you believe you're one of his
[1:11:35] how many abraham seed do we have in the
[1:11:36] house tonight
[1:11:38] that every promise in the bible is yours
[1:11:41] there's not one of them
[1:11:43] that satan can steal from you
[1:11:45] he'll come and knock on your door turn
[1:11:47] him away
[1:11:49] kick that box of rattlesnakes out of the
[1:11:51] way
[1:11:52] they're not yours don't take possession
[1:11:54] of an evil when god has already given
[1:11:56] you all the good things of the bible
