[29:05] wouldn't be right

[29:12] anything that would even have the wrong
[29:15] attitude in it lord we we want to lead
[29:17] people to you
[29:18] and not to ourselves i pray god that you
[29:21] would just speak to your people tonight
[29:23] and if there's one sick or a need
[29:25] you see them lord you know them and i
[29:27] pray god that you would just reach out
[29:29] maybe
[29:30] some that are not able to be here
[29:32] tonight and they're sick and
[29:33] maybe discouraged because they haven't
[29:35] been able to be here in a while but god
[29:36] you know about it and
[29:38] i pray god that you'd reach down where
[29:40] they're at tonight and
[29:41] as the word goes forth may they
[29:43] recognize lord that you're their healer
[29:45] i pray you granted now thank you for the
[29:48] promise of revival not in a worldwide
[29:50] way but lord in our own hearts
[29:52] father we thank you for it and we claim
[29:54] it and we believe what you've done for
[29:56] us in jesus name
[29:58] amen amen god bless you turn with me to
[30:03] genesis 2 24.
[30:04] i'm going to be dealing in corinthians
[30:06] again but i just wanted to
[30:09] read this kind of to get us started
[30:11] genesis 2 24.
[30:18] i wanted to i spoke with brother andrew
[30:21] today with andrew glover
[30:22] and he's going to be with us in december
[30:25] still several
[30:26] several weeks away but wednesday
[30:28] december
[30:29] 2nd you put that on your calendar but
[30:31] andrew glover will be here
[30:33] and minister forrest will try to be here
[30:34] for that service
[30:36] uh remember the fall festival coming up
[30:38] on the 31st if there's anything that you
[30:40] want to do to help and those that are
[30:41] helping make sure you get with my wife
[30:43] and and coordinate that and i want to
[30:46] have communion again and i'd like to do
[30:48] that if we're able to on november 8th
[30:51] so that would be the week after we don't
[30:54] want to do it the same weekend as the
[30:55] fall festival but
[30:57] it'd be the second weekend in november
[30:58] it'd be november 8th
[31:00] i'd like to do communion and that day
[31:02] and foot washing if we can
[31:04] on that day so remember that
[31:08] i want to speak tonight on the subject
[31:09] of marriage
[31:12] you know when you preach on this the
[31:14] wrong people always end up convicted
[31:17] but we have to remember that the past is
[31:19] the past and
[31:20] i'm not here to shout at you tonight but
[31:22] to tell you we all make mistakes none of
[31:25] us are perfect but
[31:26] we serve a perfect god and god has a
[31:30] perfect
[31:30] order for marriage and paul deals with
[31:33] that in corinthians and so
[31:34] i must declare the whole counsel of god
[31:37] as a pastor and i believe that god would
[31:39] have that for us
[31:40] as we're going through this series
[31:42] genesis 2 24 therefore
[31:44] shall a man leave his father and his
[31:46] mother and shall cleave unto his wife
[31:49] and they shall be one flesh i pray the
[31:52] lord would add his blessing to the
[31:54] reading of the word you may be seated
[31:56] this evening as i said none of us are
[32:00] perfect
[32:02] someone had said that if the pope had
[32:04] been married he would soon have
[32:05] discovered he was not infallible
[32:10] i found this today while i was studying
[32:12] on this i actually had that in my notes
[32:13] and i found this
[32:15] this is actually a region 8 news article
[32:17] but it was all around the world today
[32:20] pope francis endorsed same-sex civil
[32:22] unions for the first time as
[32:24] pontiff you know he's saying he's the
[32:27] biker of christ
[32:29] and he endorsed same-sex civil unions
[32:33] i don't even know how to respond to that
[32:36] uh it says the papal thumbs up came
[32:39] midway through
[32:40] a film that the documentary that they
[32:42] made so he did this quite a while back
[32:44] they just showed the documentary the
[32:45] other day
[32:47] and he talked about that and he says
[32:49] this he said homosexual people have the
[32:51] right to be in a family
[32:53] this is on that next side homosexual
[32:55] people have the right to be in a family
[32:57] they are children of god
[32:59] francis said in one of his sit-down
[33:00] interviews for the film
[33:02] you can't kick someone out of a family
[33:03] nor make their life miserable for this
[33:06] what we have to have is a civil union
[33:08] law the way that way they are legally
[33:10] covered and one of the main characters
[33:13] in the documentary is
[33:15] juan carlos cruz and
[33:18] they had hit pope francis had initially
[33:21] discredited him and they'd come back
[33:22] together and
[33:24] cruz who is gay said that during his
[33:26] first meetings with the pope in may 2018
[33:28] after they patched things up francis
[33:29] assured him
[33:31] that god made cruz gay
[33:34] well i think we can definitively say
[33:36] that that was not the case
[33:39] god doesn't do things like that
[33:42] and that's the head of the world church
[33:45] today
[33:46] where are we at i sent that to a pastor
[33:48] and he responded back 2020.
[33:51] it's just the that's the time we're
[33:53] living in but there's a junction and
[33:54] brother branham tells us about those
[33:56] junctions he said during that time
[33:58] he said you look and see the things
[33:59] going on you realize they have to do
[34:01] what they do
[34:03] they have to do what they do and but we
[34:05] have to do what we do as well
[34:07] we have to follow the word of god and so
[34:09] i don't say these things to be
[34:10] judgmental but
[34:11] we've got to follow the word in every
[34:13] area of our life including marriage
[34:16] we've got to have some standard to go by
[34:19] we have to be able to determine right
[34:20] from wrong and the world can't do that
[34:22] today the pope can't even do it
[34:25] and the standard cannot be private
[34:27] revelations or personal testimonies
[34:30] because if it is then we have no
[34:32] standard because if the standard for
[34:35] marriage is what somebody told you
[34:37] then i have no standard right so it's
[34:40] got to be something the world has to be
[34:42] judged by something brother branham
[34:44] taught us that paul taught us that and
[34:46] if you go back to what he told timothy
[34:47] he
[34:48] told him he said the things that you've
[34:49] heard of me he said commit to faithful
[34:52] men
[34:53] who will be able to teach others but he
[34:54] said the things you've heard of me among
[34:56] many witnesses
[34:57] so not just the things you heard that i
[34:59] said but the things you heard me say
[35:01] publicly
[35:02] and so we've had a prophet in our day
[35:04] say some things publicly and he said
[35:06] this
[35:06] he said but he is going to judge the
[35:08] world and he's got to have some standard
[35:11] to judge the world by or he would be
[35:12] unjust
[35:13] to let us go now and live this life
[35:15] without a standard to be judged by
[35:17] who would be right where could you tell
[35:20] what was right
[35:21] there has to be a standard and he said
[35:24] in his bible and that's we still have
[35:27] that bible today
[35:28] he said in his bible he would judge the
[35:30] world by jesus christ and we read here
[35:32] that jesus
[35:32] is the word and hebrews 13 and 8 said he
[35:35] is the same yesterday today and forever
[35:37] so therefore he will judge the church by
[35:40] their
[35:40] attitude towards christ who is the word
[35:44] their attitude towards christ who is the
[35:46] lord let me give you an example of that
[35:48] when the syrophoenician woman came to
[35:50] jesus
[35:52] and jesus told her who jesus being the
[35:54] word
[35:56] told her something that would have shook
[35:57] most of us i think
[35:59] because he said he told her he said you
[36:01] i won't take the children's bread and
[36:03] give it to dogs
[36:06] and he was the word and he spoke to her
[36:08] and she said
[36:09] truth lord she had the right attitude
[36:13] she said but the dogs eat the crumbs
[36:14] that fall from the masters table
[36:16] there's even mercy you might say for the
[36:18] little dogs
[36:21] so thank god for mercy tonight thank god
[36:24] for mercy that when we do things that
[36:25] are stupid we do things that are wrong
[36:27] there's still mercy for us but but
[36:30] we don't change what the word says the
[36:32] word is always right 100 of the time
[36:36] it's never wrong i think we can agree on
[36:39] that tonight so
[36:41] so he said there has to be a standard he
[36:43] would judge the world by their attitude
[36:44] towards christ was the word he said man
[36:45] shall not live by bread alone
[36:47] but by every word that proceedeth out of
[36:49] the mouth of god
[36:50] not out of the mouth of man not out of
[36:52] the seminary not out of the church but
[36:54] out of the mouth of god
[36:56] man must live by that and that alone
[37:00] he said no man's interpretation but
[37:02] god's own
[37:03] word he said well you say there is a
[37:06] mistake here
[37:08] and i love the way brother brown puts
[37:09] this he said if it is
[37:11] god is responsible for it
[37:15] isn't that a good attitude to have about
[37:16] the word he said there's a mistake if it
[37:19] is god is responsible for it he brought
[37:20] it to me
[37:21] see this is what i must take right
[37:24] here's what he said
[37:26] so you can say it's a mistake but it's
[37:27] what god gave me so you're saying god
[37:30] made a mistake
[37:32] and as i said when you talk about these
[37:34] things sometimes the wrong people are
[37:35] convicted but
[37:37] don't let your past affect your ability
[37:38] to agree with agree with the word
[37:41] the word is always right
[37:44] and first john 1 7 said if we walk in
[37:46] the light as he is in the light we have
[37:47] fellowship one with another and the
[37:48] blood of jesus christ his son
[37:50] cleanses us from how many sin all
[37:53] sin all sin and so even
[37:57] sins when it comes to marriage and
[37:59] divorce now
[38:01] in first corinthians 7 1 which is where
[38:03] we're at in our corinthian series
[38:05] brother branham says now concerning the
[38:06] things whereof you wrote unto me it is
[38:08] good for a man not to touch a woman
[38:11] that word touch is to take in marriage
[38:15] now this is something that they wrote
[38:17] they had written to him and i want us to
[38:18] keep that in mind tonight it's important
[38:20] brother branham
[38:21] uh shows us the importance of that and
[38:23] we'll get to that later
[38:24] but he is answering questions the
[38:26] corinthians have given him a series of
[38:28] questions and the wording evidently that
[38:30] they use
[38:31] is as they spoke to him said well isn't
[38:33] it better not to touch a woman
[38:35] and so he says yeah it is good for a man
[38:37] not to touch a woman
[38:40] so and so not to take a woman in
[38:43] marriage that would be great
[38:44] but not everybody's called to that in
[38:47] fact very few people are
[38:49] now they'd written him basically in this
[38:52] way to see if it was okay to be
[38:54] unmarried and paul using their own words
[38:55] said yeah that's okay
[38:57] but there's a special calling for that
[38:59] there's basically four
[39:00] classes of people that we think of when
[39:03] it comes to married
[39:04] to marriage and that's the unmarried and
[39:07] the
[39:08] engaged and the married
[39:11] and widows and widowers one whose spouse
[39:14] has died
[39:17] and you're thinking well what about
[39:18] divorced people
[39:20] well if you have a living spouse you
[39:22] you're married to someone
[39:24] and we will get into that a little bit
[39:26] later now
[39:28] the scriptures do not lend credibility
[39:30] to any other relationship and i'll just
[39:31] go ahead and say that for
[39:33] the young people there's no such thing
[39:35] as a in a relationship
[39:38] in the bible right that's on facebook
[39:41] but not on the bible
[39:44] all right that's become a major thing
[39:45] now people watch each other's facebook
[39:47] to see if
[39:48] someone's in a relationship well it
[39:50] doesn't mean anything
[39:52] right and there are no partners
[39:58] no such thing as a partner that's a
[40:00] modern construct
[40:02] my wife's not my partner she's my wife
[40:05] i could be partners with joe but joe
[40:08] can't be my wife
[40:10] right i use him i know he can take it
[40:13] but you can be partners in a business
[40:15] but that's not it's just modern the way
[40:17] people think
[40:18] modern thinking uh you're single if you
[40:21] could put it that way unmarried
[40:23] until you're married right and and then
[40:26] you're married
[40:27] so that but you say well that's stupid
[40:29] but but listen that the culture we live
[40:31] in messes
[40:32] everything up that's the gross darkness
[40:34] for the caleb that we're in as a society
[40:36] said there would be growth
[40:38] darkness upon the people where the
[40:39] people wouldn't even understand what to
[40:41] call marriage
[40:44] so there's no such thing as friends with
[40:46] benefits or open marriages and stuff
[40:48] like that
[40:49] it's it's nonsense it's a perversion of
[40:53] god's original plan
[40:56] so in first corinthians 7 2 paul deals
[40:59] with that he says
[41:00] nevertheless to avoid fornication so he
[41:02] said it is good for a man not to touch a
[41:04] woman nevertheless
[41:05] to avoid fornication let every man have
[41:07] his own wife
[41:09] every woman have her own husband
[41:13] and wesley said this about that
[41:15] scripture he said
[41:17] yet when it is needed in order to avoid
[41:19] fornication let every man have his own
[41:21] wife his own
[41:22] for christianity allows no polygamy and
[41:24] you you think well what a brother random
[41:25] state marriage and divorce we'll get to
[41:27] that
[41:28] brother braham said this in the 70th
[41:29] week of daniel he said in the nations
[41:30] where they have polygamy it's a thousand
[41:32] times
[41:32] better he was saying it's a thousand
[41:35] times better than
[41:36] divorce and remarriage for no reason
[41:39] right that's that's the age we live in
[41:42] just marriage and divorce for no reason
[41:44] and he's saying it's a thousand times
[41:46] better he said yet polygamy is wrong we
[41:48] know
[41:49] but it just shows how degraded we are
[41:53] and and so he uses that and and we'll
[41:55] get into that maybe a little bit more
[41:57] as i said it would be better than our
[41:58] system of divorce and remarriage for any
[42:00] reason but that doesn't make it right
[42:02] because polygamy wasn't so from the
[42:04] beginning
[42:05] go find out what brother branham said
[42:06] about it divorce and polygamy puts the
[42:08] two together
[42:09] it wasn't so from the beginning and
[42:12] after the new covenant came into force
[42:14] there's no talk of polygamy in the new
[42:15] testament
[42:17] because there's a new covenant and i'll
[42:20] say this
[42:20] because i know it's been a problem here
[42:22] in other places in the message not here
[42:24] necessarily in this church but just
[42:25] just in the area and even where i'm from
[42:28] and
[42:28] if you need polygamy to justify sinful
[42:30] behavior you need to be born again
[42:34] you need to come into a new covenant now
[42:37] verse three are we all right so far
[42:41] i feel like i'm walking on the water but
[42:43] you've got to have faith to walk on the
[42:44] water
[42:46] fall but verse 3 says let the husband
[42:49] render unto the wife do benevolence
[42:52] and likewise also the wife and to the
[42:54] husband
[42:56] i love what adam clark says about this
[42:58] he said what miserable work has been
[42:59] made in the peace of families by a wife
[43:01] or a husband
[43:02] pretending to be wiser than the apostle
[43:05] too holy and spiritual to keep the
[43:07] commandments of god
[43:10] due benevolence that that word is
[43:11] interesting paul uses a great word
[43:13] because he doesn't degrade it to
[43:15] a word that the greeks or the romans
[43:17] would have used
[43:18] but he calls it due benevolence or a
[43:20] duty of kindness
[43:23] a duty of kindness husbands and wives
[43:26] have a duty of kindness to one another
[43:29] verse four the wife is not power of her
[43:30] own body but the husband likewise also
[43:32] the husband
[43:33] that's not power of his own body but the
[43:35] wife
[43:37] and i'm trying to be careful as i'm
[43:39] saying these things but you understand
[43:40] those of you that are adult
[43:42] you'll understand to use the physical
[43:45] needs of your spouse as a bargaining
[43:46] chip in marriage is wrong
[43:49] we don't buy or sell intimacy in
[43:51] marriage
[43:53] physical relations within the marriage
[43:55] are not contractual
[43:57] not if you do this i'll do this that's
[43:59] not how that works
[44:01] that's why he said in verse five defraud
[44:03] you not one the other
[44:05] except it be with consent for a time
[44:07] that you may give yourselves to fasting
[44:09] in prayer and come together again
[44:10] that satan tempts you not for your
[44:12] incontinence
[44:14] now again these verses are easily abused
[44:16] because i've known men that would abuse
[44:18] this
[44:18] and use this scripture as a hammer to
[44:20] demand what is due
[44:22] and if you do that you have bigger
[44:24] problems
[44:27] because you're one and so there has to
[44:30] be some agreement even
[44:31] in matters in the home now
[44:34] but in verse six paul says but i speak
[44:36] this by permission and not of
[44:38] commandment permission it would be
[44:39] indulgence
[44:40] it's the same thing that brother brown
[44:42] talked about when he allowed
[44:44] uh when he was allowed to say stay as
[44:46] you are
[44:47] and we'll get to that but paul was
[44:49] honest that there was no old testament
[44:50] scripture for it but it's something
[44:52] come by revelation to him and so he said
[44:55] i speak this by permission not of
[44:56] commandment
[44:58] and paul was dealing with real people
[45:00] and the thing about marriage is you
[45:01] can't be a legalist
[45:03] when it comes to marriages because
[45:05] everybody's everybody's different
[45:08] and there's always two sides to every
[45:10] story
[45:11] but there is but the word is still true
[45:14] right and we have to
[45:15] abide by it and and so i asked you know
[45:18] you say well i've been in a bad
[45:20] situation
[45:20] well don't quit coming to church serve
[45:22] god do the best you can to serve god
[45:24] we've been given grace in this hour to
[45:26] do that
[45:28] but don't make a bad situation worse and
[45:30] don't do it again
[45:32] right and so we're taught to do that now
[45:35] uh so paul says this he said i would
[45:38] that all men verse 7 were even as i
[45:40] myself
[45:41] being unmarried he said but every man
[45:43] hath this proper gift of god
[45:46] one after this manner and another after
[45:48] that so paul said i'm not going to try
[45:49] to make everybody like me
[45:52] and in first corinthians 7 8 he said i
[45:55] say therefore to the unmarried and
[45:56] widows that is good for them if they
[45:58] abide even as i
[46:00] in other words don't don't put yourself
[46:01] under pressure to be married
[46:04] right it's because it's better not to be
[46:07] if you can do it
[46:08] but very few people can right and that's
[46:11] what paul's saying
[46:12] he was content in the state where he's
[46:14] in where he was
[46:16] now brother branham talked about this he
[46:19] said a young man asked me the other day
[46:20] he said you think i ought to get married
[46:21] brother branham to such and such a girl
[46:23] and i said how much do you think
[46:24] of her he said oh my i just love her
[46:27] i said well if you're not going to live
[46:28] without her you better marry her then
[46:31] but if you can live without her you
[46:33] better not
[46:37] don't go putting away your wife because
[46:38] you think you can live without her
[46:40] either but
[46:42] because scripture said god hateth
[46:44] putting away that literally
[46:46] god hates divorce right now
[46:50] um so he said but if you live without
[46:53] her you better not he said but if it's
[46:54] going to kill you
[46:55] you better go ahead and get married and
[46:58] so what i was trying to get to him this
[47:00] he said that if you love her so much
[47:02] he said now right now before you're
[47:03] married everything's just fine and dandy
[47:05] but after you get married then the toils
[47:07] and trials of life come in
[47:10] and i think all the married people can
[47:11] say amen to that
[47:13] i heard brother adam back there
[47:17] i know i won't say that
[47:24] i'm going to say sister becky is a saint
[47:26] but we'll just leave that there
[47:29] now he said after you get married then
[47:32] the toils and trials of life come in and
[47:34] all of us i think could testify that
[47:36] it's hard enough even if you do it right
[47:39] and then if you add the baggage of of
[47:41] double marriage and things like that it
[47:42] makes it harder
[47:44] it really does and i wish i could lift
[47:45] that from people because
[47:47] because you see them and you know these
[47:49] people are christians and they live for
[47:51] god and
[47:52] all their lives and it's such a
[47:53] wonderful thing that they've been saved
[47:55] they've been cleansed they're
[47:57] put away in the mind of god but yet it
[47:58] comes to their mind
[48:00] and you watch people deal with that for
[48:01] years and years and years you think
[48:03] and they know that they're saved but
[48:05] still i wish i wouldn't have done that
[48:07] but that's where brother brown said
[48:08] teach your children the truth
[48:11] you don't count it's what you did but
[48:12] say god god gave me grace
[48:15] and even not just grace to be saved but
[48:17] to have my family
[48:19] and to live together as husband and wife
[48:21] but don't do that thing again he said
[48:24] now so we have to preach the truth he
[48:27] said but that's when you've got to be so
[48:29] in love that you understand one another
[48:30] i want you to watch that
[48:32] that's important you've got to be so in
[48:34] love that you understand one another
[48:37] when you're disappointed in her she's
[48:39] disappointed in you
[48:41] you still understand one another
[48:45] it's important paul tells men especially
[48:47] dwell with them according to
[48:49] or peter does dwell with them according
[48:51] to wisdom
[48:52] dwell with them according to wisdom
[48:55] acknowledging that they're the weaker
[48:56] vessel
[48:58] and so you have to work to understand
[49:01] your wife
[49:03] right i'm still working on that
[49:07] most of you've been married a lot longer
[49:09] than i had but david i can't remember
[49:10] how many years you said 37 or something
[49:12] like that
[49:14] and after that many years you're still
[49:15] working on it we got some
[49:17] been married maybe more than 50 years
[49:19] here tonight and they're still working
[49:20] on it
[49:22] but you work to understand one another
[49:23] he said when you're disappointed in one
[49:25] another you still understand one another
[49:27] we'll get to that a little bit later he
[49:29] talks about that again
[49:30] in 1st corinthians 7 9 says but if they
[49:32] cannot contain let them marry
[49:34] it is better to marry than to burn and
[49:37] brother branham answers a question about
[49:38] this and i want to tell you what brother
[49:40] branham said about these scriptures
[49:41] because
[49:42] that's the best commentator we could we
[49:43] could have in this day
[49:45] through the opening of the word and
[49:47] brother brown directly addresses some of
[49:48] these scriptures in first corinthians
[49:50] seven and we won't go through all the
[49:53] way through the whole chapter tonight so
[49:54] don't worry about that
[49:56] he said but if they cannot contain let
[49:58] them married it's better to marry than
[49:59] to burn he said all right
[50:00] he said that's for just dirty living
[50:03] instead of a man a boy girl or something
[50:05] or another when they're going to get
[50:05] together and they know that they should
[50:07] get married he said go ahead and get
[50:08] married
[50:09] he said i think you'd understand what i
[50:10] mean don't you he said don't live just a
[50:13] dirty little life there because it's not
[50:14] right
[50:16] he said that's your sister in one sense
[50:18] where if you're a christian
[50:20] he said now if it's the world it's the
[50:21] world dog eat dog
[50:23] but this girl that you're going with
[50:25] that's your sister too that will be the
[50:27] mother of your children that will come
[50:28] don't live a dirty little life around
[50:30] her
[50:30] show that you're a real christian
[50:32] gentleman live like a christian
[50:34] gentleman ought to
[50:35] treat her like your sister when you get
[50:38] married still treat her that way
[50:40] not the sister that you kicked around at
[50:42] home your sister in christ
[50:45] treat her like your sister he said i
[50:48] might answer this
[50:49] right now and i'm i'm so glad that
[50:52] brother branham continues this
[50:54] it's one of the things that's been a
[50:55] blessing to me over the years you think
[50:56] how could this be a blessing to you
[50:58] people get taught wrong
[51:00] and i'm glad i had the message of the
[51:01] hour to look into and to find these
[51:03] things
[51:04] because sometimes in churches and i try
[51:07] to look at it this way what would i want
[51:09] to be taught
[51:11] if i was a a believer a new believer
[51:13] coming up and
[51:14] and i was not long ago what would i want
[51:16] to be taught from the word of god
[51:18] that i could apply to my life and this
[51:19] is one of those things
[51:21] brother brandon says i might answer this
[51:23] right now i don't believe in filthy
[51:24] living amongst pentecostal people
[51:26] holiness people even if they're married
[51:28] he said i don't believe in that no sir
[51:30] some of this dirty stuff that's so
[51:31] horrible
[51:32] he said he said i get in here sometimes
[51:34] on these he said not this morning
[51:36] he said but i mean on times i'm out in
[51:37] california and different places like
[51:39] that
[51:40] i mean ministers out there were on the
[51:41] discernment i feel like i could turn
[51:43] them over my knee and
[51:44] give them a little gospel protoplasmic
[51:46] stimulation
[51:48] he said yes sir am i to see a man that
[51:50] will try to take his little wife and
[51:51] dirty filthy he said you understand what
[51:52] i mean
[51:53] he said i think you ought to be ashamed
[51:54] of yourself as a man of god
[51:56] he said you just be a husband be a
[51:58] sweetheart
[52:00] respect her like you always respect her
[52:02] he said don't pay any attention
[52:04] to some of these sexy books or these
[52:05] nonsense and this sexy books and things
[52:08] that you read about all this stuff and
[52:09] everything like that
[52:10] get that filthy stuff out of your mind
[52:13] and we could say add
[52:14] internet to that today don't go by what
[52:17] you read or what you see on the internet
[52:18] you'll have a warped idea of marriage
[52:20] and you'll work the rest of your life
[52:22] trying to get that out of your head
[52:25] so now he said he said the bible
[52:29] said let not one dirty conversation come
[52:32] among you
[52:33] when you profess holiness treat that
[52:35] little lady like she's your little
[52:36] sweetheart if she's 60 years old you
[52:38] just be the same
[52:39] you'd be that gallant boyfriend
[52:43] i wonder if any of you been married over
[52:46] 50 years could be that
[52:47] gallant boyfriend still i've seen that i
[52:50] i've watched some of you i know that you
[52:52] still do that and
[52:54] and i i know i've watched probably know
[52:56] by the jt
[52:57] as well as i do any of you and i've
[52:58] watched them lately brother jt doing
[53:00] certain things to make it easier for her
[53:02] and she's doing certain things make it
[53:03] easier for him and
[53:05] and that's good there's a gallantry to
[53:08] that
[53:08] because you passed that that you know
[53:10] that
[53:11] maybe years ago you passed the the heat
[53:14] of the physical side but now you're
[53:17] coming to a place where
[53:18] you got to be a boyfriend again huh you
[53:22] know you understand it
[53:23] you got to be a gallant boyfriend and if
[53:25] you're that the other part will come
[53:27] with it now
[53:28] he said you don't especially when you're
[53:30] young and
[53:31] because why is women excuse me tonight
[53:34] but women are made to respond
[53:36] that's what they do that's what women do
[53:39] and so
[53:40] a lot of times a woman can be bad but
[53:43] you take a man that's really strong in
[53:45] faith and lives for god there's some
[53:48] things there that
[53:49] a man can really influence his home in a
[53:51] way that no one else can
[53:53] it's harder for a woman because she
[53:54] can't be the head of the house
[53:57] right but a man can be the head of his
[53:59] house and should be
[54:02] and he and the woman responds to that
[54:04] now and so he says you don't try
[54:06] he said none of these new things he said
[54:08] i know what i'm talking about i said you
[54:09] just be a husband a genuine brother a
[54:11] genuine christian
[54:12] he said i know that sounds but you're my
[54:14] kids i got a right to say what i want to
[54:16] you
[54:16] say amen brother branham said you see
[54:19] you're my kids you live right
[54:21] he said you women live the right way to
[54:23] your husband your husband live the right
[54:25] way to your wives be real
[54:26] nice he said and respect one another
[54:28] your family relations and so forth like
[54:30] that let it be just reverently and godly
[54:32] and greed with among you in everything
[54:33] as it can be
[54:35] he said don't never push and shove and
[54:37] be dirty and vulgar
[54:39] so i want you to take notice of that
[54:40] under like that agreed with among you
[54:43] as much as it can be try to agree
[54:46] and so many times in marriage we look
[54:48] for disagreements
[54:50] we get up itching for a fight
[54:53] right and so the first thing that's not
[54:54] right we we disagree
[54:56] but try to come to an agreement
[54:58] understand one another
[55:00] and so brother brown says understand he
[55:03] said talk to your wife
[55:06] now that ought to be part of marriage
[55:08] shouldn't it
[55:09] that's hard to do isn't it some of you
[55:12] men
[55:13] talk to your wife it's hard for me
[55:15] sometimes and i'm rather
[55:17] what's the word locatious i don't know
[55:19] if i'm pronouncing that correctly
[55:21] i i like to to talk
[55:25] i can't believe that's the first word
[55:26] that came to mind
[55:29] i like to talk but it's hard sometimes
[55:32] to talk to your wife
[55:34] sometimes your wife can be the hardest
[55:35] person now you all are angels but i'm
[55:37] not
[55:39] sometimes your wife can be the hardest
[55:40] person to talk to but brother brandon
[55:42] said talk to your wife
[55:43] if one nature is to you and another
[55:45] nature to her talk it with her
[55:47] you try to do the same thing to him
[55:48] sister in the same way understand one
[55:50] another
[55:52] understand one another real christian
[55:55] gentlemen a real christian ladies and
[55:56] brother and sister with one another
[55:58] always remember your god's children
[56:01] you're from a royal family you're a
[56:04] royal blood there's no better blood in
[56:06] the world than yours
[56:07] thank the lord he said and that's right
[56:10] a royal blood shows itself he said
[56:11] that's what it is it's royal
[56:13] oh believe that say amen he said yes sir
[56:15] shows what you are i'm a son of the king
[56:17] i'm the son of the king
[56:18] my wife's the daughter of the king how
[56:19] would i treat that king's daughter
[56:21] how would she treat that king's son see
[56:23] what i mean be real
[56:25] genuine
[56:28] if you can't open up with her who are
[56:29] you going to open up to
[56:32] if you can't be vulnerable to your wife
[56:34] where can you be vulnerable
[56:36] where are you ever going to talk about
[56:37] that if you can't do that to your wife
[56:41] now paul goes on in 1st corinthians 7
[56:43] 10. he said unto the married i command
[56:45] yet not i but the lord
[56:47] let not the wife depart from her husband
[56:51] now here he wants them to understand
[56:52] that this is the word of god
[56:55] god hates divorce let not the wife
[56:56] depart from her husband
[56:59] but we also live in a real world he says
[57:01] but and if she depart
[57:03] if she depart let her remain unmarried
[57:06] or be reconciled to her husband let not
[57:08] the husband put away his wife
[57:11] huh that kind of goes on both sides
[57:12] don't it
[57:15] christians keep their word
[57:18] what did i say when i married my wife
[57:21] for better or worse
[57:23] and richer and poorer sickness and then
[57:26] health
[57:28] what i made a promise and i realized
[57:31] that that promise is depending on
[57:32] someone else you're making a promise
[57:34] that's depending on them
[57:35] in a lot of ways i'm so glad we make a
[57:38] promise to god he's already
[57:39] kept his part of the bargain she happy
[57:42] for that
[57:43] he'll never let you down but sometimes
[57:45] we get let down in life but
[57:47] but you make a promise your promise is
[57:48] still there he made a vow
[57:51] and so he says if she depart let her
[57:54] remain unmarried or if he reconciled her
[57:55] husband let not the husband put away his
[57:57] wife
[57:58] he said but to the rest speak i this
[58:00] verse 12 not the lord
[58:03] if any brother has a wife or this by
[58:04] permission again what he's saying if any
[58:06] brother hath the wife that believeth not
[58:08] she'd be pleased to dwell with him let
[58:10] him not put her away
[58:13] and these are special situations he's
[58:16] dealing with
[58:18] don't be divorced simply because he or
[58:19] she is an unbeliever do everything you
[58:20] can to stay together
[58:23] work to stay together everything that
[58:25] you can do that's why i would never
[58:27] counsel someone to leave somebody unless
[58:30] there's a situation where they'd be in
[58:32] danger
[58:33] you understand i never counsel that and
[58:35] but yet sometimes it happens but if she
[58:36] does he said
[58:37] the wife should remain unmarried now
[58:42] verse 14 for the unbelieving
[58:45] i think we didn't read verse 13 the
[58:47] woman would have the husband that
[58:48] believeth not if he be pleased to dwell
[58:49] with her let her not leave him
[58:51] verse 14 for the unbelieving husband is
[58:53] sanctified by the wife
[58:55] the unbelieving wife is sanctified by
[58:57] the husband
[58:58] else were your children unclean but now
[59:01] are they holy
[59:03] a person in this situation can still
[59:05] raise god-fearing children
[59:07] a great example of that is timothy in
[59:08] the bible paul says i recognize the
[59:11] faith in use the same as what was in
[59:12] your mother and your grandmother
[59:14] and his father was a greek didn't serve
[59:17] the lord
[59:18] but his mother did serve the lord and
[59:22] raised a child
[59:22] timothy who could preach the gospel so
[59:25] first corinthians 7
[59:26] 15 but if the unbelieving depart let him
[59:28] depart
[59:30] he says a brother and sister is not
[59:31] under bondage in such cases
[59:33] but god hath called us to peace
[59:37] god hath called us to peace don't force
[59:40] them to stay
[59:42] now i want to deal with this because
[59:44] this is where the doctrine of innocent
[59:46] party remarriage comes from i don't know
[59:48] if you've heard it put that way
[59:49] but among denominational circles it's
[59:51] called innocent party remarriage
[59:54] and it's a doctrine that whoever the
[59:56] innocent party is
[59:57] can get remarried the problem with that
[1:00:00] is
[1:00:01] who have you ever talked to that was
[1:00:02] divorced that wasn't the innocent party
[1:00:07] right i mean everybody's going to say
[1:00:08] they were in some way
[1:00:11] the problem as well with it is brother
[1:00:13] branham didn't teach that
[1:00:16] and paul doesn't teach it he doesn't
[1:00:18] give permission to remarry he doesn't
[1:00:19] say that he says a brother or sister is
[1:00:21] not under bondage
[1:00:22] in such cases bondage to what to remain
[1:00:25] together
[1:00:27] he doesn't say anything about remarriage
[1:00:30] now in questions and answers 1962
[1:00:32] brother branham deals directly with that
[1:00:34] he said first corinthians 7 chapter 15
[1:00:35] verse he said now the question they
[1:00:37] asked brother branham
[1:00:38] does this mean a sister or brother is
[1:00:39] free to remarry he said
[1:00:41] no he said see you don't get his
[1:00:43] question there and what he's saying
[1:00:45] now and brother branham he presents this
[1:00:48] like a theologian
[1:00:50] you go and look back at the commentator
[1:00:51] and stuff i know he wasn't educated but
[1:00:53] brother branham knew what he was talking
[1:00:54] about
[1:00:55] because he talks about he said see you
[1:00:57] don't get his question there and what
[1:00:58] he's saying he said they're not free
[1:01:00] he said that would make a contradiction
[1:01:02] in the scripture and the scriptures
[1:01:03] don't contradict themselves at all
[1:01:05] he said now let's see he said like you
[1:01:07] can make the scripture just by reading
[1:01:08] one verse say anything you want it to
[1:01:10] say to fit your thought
[1:01:11] he said but you've got to take the
[1:01:13] thought that they're talking on
[1:01:15] i'm going to skip through this a little
[1:01:16] bit but you can go back and read the
[1:01:17] whole thing questions and answers 1962.
[1:01:21] he said see paul is writing them people
[1:01:22] saying you ask such and such a thing
[1:01:24] only he isn't
[1:01:25] just saying you ask it he's just saying
[1:01:27] that
[1:01:28] he said then there he turns around and
[1:01:29] answers them back which is contrary to
[1:01:31] what they ask
[1:01:32] he said they ask we do so and so and so
[1:01:35] and paul turns around and says something
[1:01:36] else see it looks like it's a
[1:01:38] contradiction it's not
[1:01:39] he said if you'll just read the whole
[1:01:41] verse the whole chapter you'd find out
[1:01:43] he's trying to explain what they've
[1:01:44] wrote him
[1:01:45] he said now watch his subject see and
[1:01:47] you read on down in before this on down
[1:01:49] through the chapter
[1:01:50] you find that they thought if we married
[1:01:53] a wife
[1:01:53] and i got married and i become a
[1:01:55] believer my wife wasn't a believer let
[1:01:56] me put her away
[1:01:58] oh no that isn't it you can't do that he
[1:02:02] said a brother or sister is not under
[1:02:03] bondage and
[1:02:04] and this is a skipped a paragraph he
[1:02:06] said a brother sister's not under
[1:02:08] bondage in such case
[1:02:09] that is if your companion is putting you
[1:02:11] away and wants to depart for it
[1:02:13] you don't have to just hold on to them
[1:02:16] if they're wanting to leave you and
[1:02:17] they're going to leave you for the cause
[1:02:18] of christ let them leave
[1:02:20] but you can't remarry but god has called
[1:02:23] us to peace
[1:02:26] see and and so you seek peace in a
[1:02:28] marriage you seek peace in your home
[1:02:30] god has called us to peace even if you
[1:02:32] stay together
[1:02:35] right seek peace in your home now
[1:02:38] he said see now that that you can not
[1:02:41] that you can remarry again he's already
[1:02:42] stated that but you don't have to live
[1:02:43] with an unbelieving husband or
[1:02:44] unbelieving wife if they are not willing
[1:02:47] and on down he says but now just say i
[1:02:49] brother branham i got married my wife's
[1:02:50] an unbeliever and here's a sister over
[1:02:52] here i can marry he said i'm going to
[1:02:53] leave this one and marry that one oh no
[1:02:54] no indeed
[1:02:55] your vows until death you separate
[1:02:57] there's nothing else in the world
[1:02:58] will permit you to marry in the bible
[1:03:00] until your companion is dead he said
[1:03:01] that's right there are only grounds
[1:03:02] there's no remarrying nowhere at all
[1:03:04] except a dead companion that's all he
[1:03:06] goes on down he said there's no such
[1:03:08] thing as any believer ever being
[1:03:09] reconciled to remarriage again with a
[1:03:11] living companion
[1:03:13] are you still with me now
[1:03:16] people ask what about marriage and
[1:03:18] divorce i want to read from marriage and
[1:03:21] divorce
[1:03:21] i'm going to read several paragraphs but
[1:03:23] and i apologize for reading so much but
[1:03:25] it's just
[1:03:26] we have to know what a prophet taught
[1:03:28] and i know that you know these things
[1:03:30] but we need to be reminded of these
[1:03:31] things we have to be able to accept the
[1:03:34] word as true
[1:03:36] just as basically being true and then we
[1:03:39] work from there
[1:03:40] we can't come and say well i don't think
[1:03:42] that means what it says well then what
[1:03:43] we have no grounds to work on
[1:03:46] we have no common ground to work on if
[1:03:47] you if you don't acknowledge that the
[1:03:49] bible and the scriptures are true
[1:03:51] then how do you have any uh
[1:03:54] any place for uh to to work for the
[1:03:58] mercy of god and to to ask for the mercy
[1:04:00] of god
[1:04:01] and so now in marriage and divorce
[1:04:03] brother brown says friends then i'm
[1:04:04] closing he said you can go from this
[1:04:08] so that perks your ears up doesn't it
[1:04:10] here's what you can go from
[1:04:12] brother brown just got done with a long
[1:04:14] sermon where he talked about different
[1:04:15] things
[1:04:16] and the polygamy law and all those
[1:04:18] things that were there
[1:04:20] he said you can go from this that's when
[1:04:22] this was being revealed to me said what
[1:04:23] i'm going to tell you right now
[1:04:25] so don't miss it he said no i'm speaking
[1:04:28] to our followers only who is following
[1:04:30] me
[1:04:31] and this message only not the outside
[1:04:35] every record of this before god just to
[1:04:36] this group only i believe i'm part of
[1:04:38] that group
[1:04:41] where are we at without a messenger
[1:04:44] right we
[1:04:44] we don't can't even start we just go
[1:04:47] join the baptist church
[1:04:48] or the methodist or the pentecost or
[1:04:50] whatever would fit our our view of the
[1:04:52] word
[1:04:53] but we have a messenger in our day and
[1:04:55] so we have to say what he said now
[1:04:58] this is uh brother branham says this he
[1:05:01] says to this group only now we are found
[1:05:03] in this mess because of misinterpreted
[1:05:05] theology
[1:05:07] we are found in this mess because of
[1:05:08] misinterpreted theology
[1:05:10] then if we get ourselves in a mess again
[1:05:12] wouldn't it be because of misinterpreted
[1:05:13] theology
[1:05:17] right and not that there wouldn't be
[1:05:18] mercy but but if we get ourselves in a
[1:05:20] mess again it's misinterpreted theology
[1:05:23] he said now he said is that right that's
[1:05:25] why you women married the second time
[1:05:27] and you men because
[1:05:28] misinterpreted theology he said now i
[1:05:31] want to show you something that he told
[1:05:33] me
[1:05:34] he said and if god our creator was
[1:05:35] questioned the question when he was here
[1:05:37] on our jesus christ
[1:05:38] when his delivering prophet came forth
[1:05:40] moses down in egypt to bring the
[1:05:41] children out of egypt
[1:05:42] to put them in the promised land jesus
[1:05:44] said here that moses seen the people in
[1:05:45] this condition
[1:05:46] he granted them a writing of divorcement
[1:05:49] because the situation was what it was
[1:05:52] moses found such as let him suffer god
[1:05:54] permitted moses the prophet sent to the
[1:05:55] people
[1:05:56] to grant this writing of divorcement and
[1:05:58] that's not what brother branham did
[1:06:00] but he's saying that god allowed the
[1:06:01] prophet to make a special accommodation
[1:06:03] because of the hardness of their heart
[1:06:05] because of the condition of the age
[1:06:08] right that's what god did he allowed him
[1:06:10] to make that accommodation because of
[1:06:12] of the age and if you go back and study
[1:06:14] that jesus said because of the hardness
[1:06:16] of your hearts well what was the gospel
[1:06:17] supposed to do
[1:06:19] to take out that hard heart to give us a
[1:06:22] heart of flesh
[1:06:25] so what we're going back to and the
[1:06:26] point of all this is we
[1:06:28] we don't believe in divorce no not as
[1:06:31] christians so we
[1:06:32] we serve god
[1:06:36] if and so as christians if and paul goes
[1:06:38] on into it to talk about it
[1:06:40] but if you're married don't seek to be
[1:06:42] loosed if you're single don't don't seek
[1:06:44] to be married god will provide you a
[1:06:46] wife if you need one but let it be him
[1:06:48] that does it
[1:06:49] and he will not lead you outside of the
[1:06:51] word
[1:06:53] he just can't do it the holy ghost may
[1:06:56] permit you to do something outside the
[1:06:58] word but it'll end up like balaam
[1:07:01] right because because you keep asking he
[1:07:04] may let you do it
[1:07:06] but it won't ever be right but but again
[1:07:09] we make mistakes we're not perfect
[1:07:13] but god is aren't you glad you serve a
[1:07:16] perfect
[1:07:16] god who is the word now
[1:07:21] he said god permitted moses to grant
[1:07:23] this writing of divorcement to them in
[1:07:24] first corinthians the seventh chapter
[1:07:25] the 12th and 15th verse the new
[1:07:27] testament prophet paul
[1:07:28] who met the same thing in the church and
[1:07:30] spoke this this is i not the lord
[1:07:32] right because of the divorce conditions
[1:07:35] he said it wasn't so from the beginning
[1:07:36] but moses was permitted it and god
[1:07:38] recognized it righteousness
[1:07:40] paul also had a right when he found his
[1:07:42] church in that condition
[1:07:43] he said no you believe this to be true
[1:07:45] and believe it to come from god
[1:07:47] he said and by the vindication of his
[1:07:48] cloud and his message that's brought me
[1:07:50] this far should not god upon the
[1:07:51] mountain
[1:07:52] permit me to do the same thing to suffer
[1:07:54] you to go on the way you
[1:07:56] are and do it no more
[1:08:00] you never said something about go and do
[1:08:02] it again
[1:08:03] you got permission now just go get
[1:08:05] married as many times as you want to
[1:08:07] start putting away your wife when god
[1:08:08] says god hates putting away
[1:08:10] what he said go on as you are that's
[1:08:13] grace
[1:08:16] that's grace because of modern
[1:08:19] conditions the world's messed up
[1:08:21] but aren't you glad for grace
[1:08:24] so think about the grace of it it's not
[1:08:26] a condemnation i know people that won't
[1:08:28] listen to marriage and divorce
[1:08:30] won't read it because they feel
[1:08:31] condemnation over it but that's not what
[1:08:32] it is at all
[1:08:34] it's grace god allowed them to go ahead
[1:08:37] and as they are
[1:08:39] let them go on as they are in sin no
[1:08:40] more he said now
[1:08:43] go with your wives and live in peace for
[1:08:44] the hours late the coming of the lord is
[1:08:46] at hand
[1:08:47] he said we haven't got time to break
[1:08:49] these things up
[1:08:51] don't you dare try to do it again he
[1:08:54] said i'm speaking only to my
[1:08:55] congregation but if you are married
[1:08:57] god bore me witness of that on the
[1:08:58] mountain that i could say this a
[1:09:00] supernatural revelation
[1:09:01] because of the opening of the seven
[1:09:03] seals and this is a question in god's
[1:09:05] word let them go on in as they are
[1:09:08] and sin no more and then he said it
[1:09:11] wasn't so
[1:09:12] from the beginning what was the
[1:09:14] beginning one man and one woman
[1:09:17] in a lifetime contract
[1:09:21] and really adam and eve was an eternal
[1:09:24] contract because death hadn't even
[1:09:26] entered in yet
[1:09:28] so there's your eternal mate and glory
[1:09:30] now look he said
[1:09:32] and people have a question about that
[1:09:34] you know i've had people come even
[1:09:36] in a church that i pastored and and say
[1:09:38] well you may not be meant for him and he
[1:09:40] may not be meant for her but you'll find
[1:09:41] out one day you know who you're meant to
[1:09:43] be married to
[1:09:44] if you're married the person you're
[1:09:47] married to
[1:09:49] all right just get that out of your head
[1:09:51] right now well if i went for that first
[1:09:54] girl that i liked you know
[1:09:57] i'd have been better off no get that out
[1:09:59] of your head because your eternal mate
[1:10:01] is the one that god gave you
[1:10:03] and has given you grace to live with all
[1:10:05] these years
[1:10:07] aren't you it takes grace to be married
[1:10:12] amen now
[1:10:16] he said go with your wives and live in
[1:10:17] peace
[1:10:19] and but he said it wasn't so from the
[1:10:20] beginning that's right he said it wasn't
[1:10:22] so
[1:10:23] he said and it will not be at the end
[1:10:25] but under modern conditions as god's
[1:10:27] servant he said i won't call myself as
[1:10:28] prophet but i believe maybe if i
[1:10:30] wouldn't be sent for that
[1:10:31] i'm laying a ground for him when he does
[1:10:33] come he said so under the modern
[1:10:35] conditions i command you to go to your
[1:10:37] home
[1:10:38] with your wife now he said if you're
[1:10:40] happy with her live with her
[1:10:41] raise your children on the admonition of
[1:10:43] god but god be merciful to you if you
[1:10:46] ever do that again
[1:10:48] now what's he saying acknowledge that
[1:10:49] the word is true
[1:10:52] i i if i do wrong it doesn't mean that
[1:10:55] the word's not true
[1:10:57] right if i'd tell a lie god forbid that
[1:11:00] i would
[1:11:00] but if i would tell a lie i don't go in
[1:11:02] the bible and try to justify lying
[1:11:06] right but i would acknowledge the word
[1:11:08] is true and repent
[1:11:11] right and that's what we have to do the
[1:11:13] word of god is
[1:11:14] is what we have to have we've been
[1:11:16] talking about revival and what we needed
[1:11:17] to
[1:11:18] to see revival come we have to go back
[1:11:20] to the word
[1:11:22] if there's going to be revival there's
[1:11:24] got to be us coming back to terms with
[1:11:26] the word
[1:11:27] an absolute surrender to the word like a
[1:11:30] branch surrenders to the vine
[1:11:33] it's absolute it's completely the branch
[1:11:35] is completely dependent on the vine
[1:11:38] the vine does all the work it it grits
[1:11:40] all the nutrients and all the soil in
[1:11:41] the branches it's there
[1:11:42] and produces fruit but everything it has
[1:11:45] in it is pushed through it from the vine
[1:11:47] it's completely dependent that's the way
[1:11:49] we have to be on the word of god he said
[1:11:50] i am the vine you are the branches
[1:11:53] then what are we we're dependent on that
[1:11:55] word to live if i want to have a
[1:11:56] marriage that makes it in laodicea
[1:11:59] i've got to be so dependent on the word
[1:12:02] that my marriage i can look into the
[1:12:04] word to find out how
[1:12:05] i should treat my wife and what we
[1:12:07] should do as a couple
[1:12:08] see these things really matter where we
[1:12:11] live
[1:12:12] we've got to go back to the word
[1:12:14] acknowledge the word is right
[1:12:17] i wish i could change it for people i
[1:12:20] wish i could
[1:12:22] i've had people tell me i'm an exception
[1:12:25] to the rule i wish i could fix that for
[1:12:27] you
[1:12:28] wish i could make it so that you are but
[1:12:31] i can't
[1:12:34] god knows that
[1:12:38] a preacher would have to be out of his
[1:12:39] mind to come into a church and
[1:12:42] and just preach things to run people off
[1:12:44] on purpose
[1:12:45] that's not my purpose i don't want to do
[1:12:47] that but we've got to get back to the
[1:12:49] word
[1:12:51] we can't do things that the word of god
[1:12:53] does not allow and expect god to bless
[1:12:55] us
[1:12:56] we just can't do it we have to come back
[1:12:59] to the word
[1:13:01] and that's all i can say as a pastor you
[1:13:03] you can do as you wish
[1:13:04] as adults as american citizens but for
[1:13:06] me as
[1:13:08] joshua said choose you this day whom you
[1:13:09] will serve but as for me and my house
[1:13:13] we will serve the lord i wonder if you
[1:13:15] say amen to that tonight
[1:13:17] i'm going to serve the lord in my
[1:13:18] marriage now he said you teach your
[1:13:21] children to never do a thing like that
[1:13:24] he said bring them up in the admonition
[1:13:26] of god and now that you are as you are
[1:13:29] let us go now at the late evening hour
[1:13:31] that we're living in
[1:13:33] press towards the mark of the high
[1:13:34] calling in christ
[1:13:36] where all things will be possible
[1:13:40] listen to this this is the last verse
[1:13:41] i'll read first corinthians 7 16 for
[1:13:43] what noah's thou
[1:13:45] o wife whether thou shalt save thy
[1:13:48] husband
[1:13:50] or how knowest thou a man whether thou
[1:13:52] shalt save thy wife
[1:13:54] what if you would be the instrument of
[1:13:57] salvation
[1:13:58] that god uses for someone who isn't
[1:14:01] exactly what they should be
[1:14:04] but god somehow you are allowed to be
[1:14:06] married for some reason
[1:14:09] for some reason and they're just not
[1:14:10] what they should be but but you might be
[1:14:12] the thing that god uses
[1:14:16] he said well how could that be what
[1:14:17] could i say well it's not what you say
[1:14:21] but it's just it's you it's how you live
[1:14:24] it's every day it's you see he said
[1:14:28] how how knowest or wife whether there
[1:14:30] shall save thy husband or how noah said
[1:14:31] oh man
[1:14:32] whether thou shalt save thy wife what if
[1:14:33] god put you in your marriage
[1:14:35] for that reason and allowed you to be
[1:14:39] there
[1:14:40] i think all of us could say this we
[1:14:41] would not be what we are today
[1:14:43] if you're a married person today you've
[1:14:44] been married for a while you would not
[1:14:46] be what you are today unless you had
[1:14:47] married that person
[1:14:50] right not unless you'd been married
[1:14:53] but you would be a different person in
[1:14:55] some way if you had not married that
[1:14:57] person
[1:14:59] maybe even if your husband or wife has
[1:15:01] passed on you could still say that
[1:15:03] i'm different today because i married
[1:15:05] that person
[1:15:07] all those years ago what did it what was
[1:15:09] it it was something about
[1:15:11] god puts you together because he he or
[1:15:14] he allowed you to come together even if
[1:15:15] it wasn't perfect but he allowed things
[1:15:17] to happen where
[1:15:19] you could be what you are today we don't
[1:15:21] understand all of that
[1:15:22] but he said all things work together for
[1:15:24] the good
[1:15:26] all that ought to give us confidence
[1:15:28] today all things work together for the
[1:15:30] good
[1:15:31] so next time you get really really mad
[1:15:33] at your wife or husband
[1:15:34] don't tell me it never happens next time
[1:15:37] you get really upset
[1:15:38] put that scripture in your mind all
[1:15:41] things
[1:15:44] maybe god put you in her life
[1:15:47] maybe god put brother joe and says
[1:15:50] joanna's life just to
[1:15:52] make her mad enough to get up for a
[1:15:55] sickness
[1:15:59] it's a private joke but you know
[1:16:04] god will do that god wants somebody that
[1:16:07] people he allowed moses to be married to
[1:16:09] a woman that would speak up
[1:16:11] huh he said well they shouldn't have
[1:16:14] been married
[1:16:15] they were not fit for each other when
[1:16:16] she was yelling and screaming at him in
[1:16:18] the tent they just
[1:16:19] wasn't a good fit for the prophet that's
[1:16:22] exactly who he needed to be brother
[1:16:23] brown said god put them together
[1:16:26] because he knew exactly what moses
[1:16:28] needed
[1:16:30] are you glad for the grace of god see
[1:16:33] i'm closing with this musicians go ahead
[1:16:35] and come we don't get married to be
[1:16:36] happy
[1:16:38] we get married to make someone else
[1:16:40] happy
[1:16:41] you love someone so much that you want
[1:16:44] that person to be
[1:16:45] happy brother brown said even if you
[1:16:47] loved them right you knew they'd be
[1:16:49] happier with someone else
[1:16:50] you let them marry someone else
[1:16:54] that's hard to take isn't it we don't
[1:16:56] get married to be happy
[1:16:58] we get married to make someone else
[1:16:59] happy let me leave you with this i don't
[1:17:01] usually close the service this way but i
[1:17:02] want to close with a challenge
[1:17:04] for those of you who are married
[1:17:09] next wednesday we'll talk about the rest
[1:17:11] of this chapter and then
[1:17:13] i don't think paul deals with marriage
[1:17:14] again really in first corinthians
[1:17:17] but i want you to
[1:17:20] this week those of you here in the
[1:17:23] church and you can do it or not do it
[1:17:25] i'm not going to make you do it but
[1:17:27] i want to challenge you to do this do
[1:17:30] something that you don't normally do
[1:17:31] that you know will make your spouse
[1:17:33] happy
[1:17:35] that's going to be hard for some of you
[1:17:36] because you just make each other happy
[1:17:37] all the time
[1:17:40] but i've already thought of a few things
[1:17:42] for myself
[1:17:44] do something this week that you don't
[1:17:46] normally do that you know will please
[1:17:48] your spouse
[1:17:49] because paul talks about in the in the
[1:17:50] part that we're going to read next he
[1:17:52] talks about how that the married
[1:17:53] man looks how to please his wife
[1:17:56] the married woman looks how to please
[1:17:58] her husband find something that you know
[1:18:00] will make
[1:18:01] your wife happy if you want ideas i've
[1:18:03] got ideas
[1:18:05] maybe just take out the garbage pick up
[1:18:08] your clothes have dinner ready maybe for
[1:18:11] a wife when he gets home or for the
[1:18:12] husband for that matter
[1:18:14] if it works out that way bring home
[1:18:16] flowers do the dishes stay off facebook
[1:18:19] there might be something you could do
[1:18:22] maybe don't go hunting
[1:18:25] i can say that because i don't want so
[1:18:30] something that the only purpose of it is
[1:18:31] to make them happy
[1:18:34] expect nothing in return then i don't
[1:18:36] want you to necessarily tell me about it
[1:18:38] although you're welcome to but ponder
[1:18:40] the results
[1:18:42] think about what life would be like if
[1:18:44] we treated each other like this all the
[1:18:46] time
[1:18:49] do something say well that person they i
[1:18:51] just can't make them happy
[1:18:52] try make an attempt i believe it'll make
[1:18:56] a difference let's bow our heads heavily
[1:18:58] father
[1:19:00] sometimes our services are different and
[1:19:03] we want them to all be the same but lord
[1:19:05] we know that
[1:19:07] you called us at different times to hear
[1:19:09] different things
[1:19:10] tonight you want us to hear about
[1:19:12] marriage i believe that lord
[1:19:15] i'm a poor subject to speak it but lord
[1:19:17] you brought a message in our day and
[1:19:20] that messenger said what paul said i'm
[1:19:23] so grateful for that lord
[1:19:25] i pray you would help us in our
[1:19:27] marriages father
[1:19:30] i think sometimes we don't realize how
[1:19:32] close
[1:19:33] that we could be to messing up and
[1:19:37] maybe even if we've been married a long
[1:19:38] time we don't realize that
[1:19:40] we're fallible
[1:19:41] [Music]
[1:19:44] we're not a pope we're not a law to
[1:19:46] ourselves we don't get to make up the
[1:19:49] god rules showed us in the word if we do
[1:19:50] certain things we'd be happy
[1:19:53] i pray you'd help us to do those things
[1:19:55] lord prophet come in our day and just
[1:19:57] give us some very simple things that we
[1:19:58] could do
[1:19:59] how we can treat one another and try to
[1:20:01] understand one another try to make one
[1:20:02] another happy
[1:20:05] pay the debt of kindness as paul puts in
[1:20:08] lord me
[1:20:09] may we do something lord and and
[1:20:12] to help our marriages lord maybe there's
[1:20:13] someone here tonight
[1:20:15] and and they not married and maybe a
[1:20:17] spouse has passed away or
