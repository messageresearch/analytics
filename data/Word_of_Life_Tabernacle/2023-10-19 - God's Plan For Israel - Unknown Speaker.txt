in the house of the Lord I'm going to want to speak to you tonight on God's plan for Israel we're going to read from Revelation 71 before we get into the seventh seal on Wednesday nights I want to deal with this and maybe one other subject Revelation 71 we won't just be talking about Israel tonight we're talking about us as as well we want to focus on this while you're turning there I I want to add my condolences to brother Donnie Reagan and his family sister Erica's uh death I uh can't imagine what it would be like to lose a daughter uh but our families you know if something does happen we know that they're in a better place and thankful for that thankful this isn't all there is but the bill there's a place that's so much more real than what we have have here and so I'm grateful for that today but I just add my condolences and and prayers for that family and then brother Billy Paul uh being they say pretty close passing over uh he's 88 years old and and I will say this brother Billy's always always done what he could for this message and I appreciate that and uh his testimony meant a lot to me as a young man and uh and meeting him and and knowing that he had a firsthand account of what happened you know those people who were there are passing away not very many left just a very few I'm thankful I got to meet some of them but for my children and you know if the Lord carries a few more years there won't be any left and what are we going to do then well we just have to believe the word and believe what God Said and believe what God has done and so I think it's it's a testing time that we're living in for sure the Bible says everything that can be shaken will be shaken and remember that includes everything in our lives but if the Lord builds the house amen nobody can tear it down aren't you glad for that today amen glad I'm I'm one of those that cannot be shaken and trust that all of us are Revelation 71 after these things I saw four Angels standing on the four corners of the Earth holding the Four Winds of the earth that the wind should not blow on the earth nor on the sea nor on any tree you believe God's got control over everything know these winds are the Winds of War the winds would not blow on any sea or on any tree I saw another Angel ascend from the East having the Seal of the Living God he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the Sea saying hurt not the Earth neither the sea nor the trees till we have sealed the Servants of our God in their foreheads and I heard the number of them which were sealed there were sealed of aund 144,000 of all the tribes of the children of Israel I pray the Lord would add his Blessing to the word you may be seated in 1954 on his way to India for a meeting brandom stood in the airport in Cairo with a ticket in his hand to go to Jerusalem and show the sign of the Messiah in that country and show them that God still had prophets and that a prophet prophets uh still saw visions and just like Bible days again which we experienced and he was headed that direction and the Holy Spirit said no that it isn't time yet because and then later on he finds out well that's because there's two prophets going to Israel and it wouldn't be our Prophet at all but it would be two different men that God chooses whether that's Moses and Elijah literally or men with that those Spirits which I tend to think that it will be men with that Spirit on them uh then uh God's going to do that in his own time there will be 144,000 brother BR said that believe the message and uh so but that that time wasn't yet now we know that Israel is God's chosen people how many believe that the Bible teaches that all Israel will be saved Romans 11:26 and so all Israel shall be saved as it is written there shall come out of Zion deliver and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob and Paul on down verse 28 he said as concerning the gospel they are enemies for your sakes as touching the election they are beloved for the father's sakes verse 29 for the gifts and calling of God without repentance God loved them even though they didn't repent I'm going to tell you something now uh God loved you before you repented and one day you realized how much you loved he loved you and that's why you gave your heart to him amen but the gifts and callings of God are without repentance now Paul had preious previously taught that not all Israel is elected right and we we dealt with that in the fifth seal but just to kind of hammer that down because there'll only be 144,000 out of that Jewish Nation but they those 144,000 will be saved as a nation so Romans 9:6 not as though the word of God had taken none effect they are not all Israel which are of Israel neither because they are the Seed of Abraham are they all children he said but in Isaac shall thy seed be called that is they which are the children of the flesh these are not the children of God but the children of the promise are counted for the seed and we know we're the spiritual Seed of Abraham how we believe that tonight we are the spiritual Seed of Abraham but there's also an elect portion of the natural seed that will be saved as a nation during the time of the Great Tribulation and and so you can kind of look at it there there's an elect Jew and there's also a uh there's also a sort of what we have uh a foolish virgin that will be uh during the tribulation period they'll come during that time that uh uh that have to be purged during that time so the Jews have to be purged but there's also a uh a group of Jews that uh under Hitler and hman and those that were given a white robes PR taught us that that fist seal happens after we leave there already under the altar but they haven't been given white robes yet but as soon as we leave he gives them white robes and what did they do to deserve that well they got killed the Bible said they did hold the testimony uh of uh of what they knew and they and and they believed what all that they knew and that'll be the same with the foolish virgin we'll get into them maybe at some other time but brother brandom deals with uh in the seventh seal deals with this and and so we find the brightest gone the ones that were martyred under Hitler and nightman and all down through uh last 2,000 years actually will be given white robes and then he sends the two prophets to Israel for the day of atonement to get 144,000 to 144,000 of the elect Revelation 71 let's read that again after these things I saw four Angels standing on the four corners of the Earth holding the Four Winds of the earth wind should not blow on the earth nor in the sea nor in any tree so God now now this is important for right now God allows war and he stops War right and and if this uh is a Prelude what we're seeing to the third world war if it's what it if that's what it is then uh then there'll be nothing that we can do to stop it right it'll just happen right and Wars world wars have been fought over less but if it's not then it it'll just stop right because God holds that god holds the keys to that brandom said that the first world war was a a symbol of that when at the 11th Hour the 11th minute he said 11th day they it stopped and no one knew why it stopped he said hold back the winds because these uh these 144,000 have to be sealed right right and what that means is they have to receive the Holy Ghost so there's going to be a Holy Ghost Church if we could say it that way Holy Ghost bunch of Jews a after we're gone yes right right and and so they they actually received the Holy Ghost and received the message of the hour now uh he said don't hurt the Earth don't hurt the sea nor the trees so we sealed the Servants of God in their foreheads now brother Bram said that's not the bride he said that's servants not the sons servants he said Israel's always been God's servants the church's Sons by birth Israel is his servant and and so in verse four he said I heard the number of them were that were sealed they were sealed 144,000 not one more one less of all the tribes of the children of Israel and so he goes down to the tribes and he says of the tribe of Judah of the tribe of Reuben of the tribe of GAD of the tribe of Asher the tribe of nepalm the tribe of Manasses of the tribe of Simeon the tribe of Levi that's something different we haven't heard of a tribe of Levi before right there are Levites but but here now he calls it the tribe of Levi and of the tribe of issachar were sealed 12,000 the tribe of zebulun were sealed 12 ,000 the tribe of Joseph that's something else that's different from any other place in the Scripture A Tribe of Joseph we sealed 12,000 of The Tribe of Benjamin were sealed 12,000 and and then John goes on in Revelation chapter 7 he sees a great multitude no man can number and those are those who go through the Great Tribulation there's a lot of people out there that are sincere in their beliefs they're going to have those beliefs tested during the Great Tribulation right A lot of people people out there and so it's not just us right there's 144,000 Jews there's a whole bunch but now when it comes to the elect the elect is a small group The elect of the Gentiles and so John sees a great multitude of foolish virgin and then but let's deal with this 144,000 for a while these 144,000 elect Jews are called under the ministry of the two prophets of Revelation 11 brother brandom's not going to come back and preach to them I'm not going to preach to them nobody else going to preach to them it's going to be these two prophets that come and preach to them and we know that uh that what's been going on is God been calling he's been he's been driving the Jews back to their Homeland yes and the fact that we have a Jewish Nation I thought how interesting it was even today our president being in Israel and and talking about the fact that there was a Jewish Nation it's not just a you wouldn't say that about America we're a we have separation of church and state but that is a Jewish Nation right it set up for that purpose because they have no other place to go they got no other they've been run off of every country in the world they've got no other place to be and I think I put a uh something on in here about that but uh but now that's the seven trumpets of Revelation 8 now we know brother brandham God told Brother brandham Don't Preach those seven trumpets you remember he went he was going to preach them he he wanted to preach them God told him not to he said cuz they don't pertain to the church at all but instead he preached the Feast of trumpets and it's a wonderful sermon you ought to listen to it if you haven't heard it in a while because really places brother B looks back at the seals and he said all the mysteries of God were revealed under the seventh seal the Seven Seals now the the seven trumpets of Revelation 8 and then on over uh the seventh trumpet is on over those are to Israel and so Leviticus 23:24 uh let's look at that for just a moment CU there's a feast of trumpets that call Israel to a day of atonement and and I'll say this it's been going on there's a whole lot more going on in the world today than just what we see right God's doing something and that ought to give us courage to understand that God's also working on us he hasn't forgotten us he's doing something for us too as the World falls apart and and they're doing whatever it is that they do but remember that the bride is also uh the God's doing something for her we're fixing to go home excuse me so I hope this doesn't bore you tonight but I just want to teach it to you the best I can and if I get something that you disagree with why you just spit that out because I am fallible and and so if I make a mistake you just correct me later don't do it while I'm preaching right now uh now listen to Leviticus 23:24 speaking to the children of Israel saying in the seventh month in the first day of the month shall you have a Sabbath a memorial blowing of trumpets a holy convocation he said and then in verse 27 he said also on the 10th day of the seventh month there shall be a day of atonement so here's a blowing of trumpets a feast of trumpets and then a feast of atonement it shall be a holy convocation you you shall afflict your souls and offering uh an offering offer an offer offering made by fire unto the Lord now brother Brandon said the trumpets is to call them back to that atonement he said see the atonement they rejected they rejected so our eyes could be open theirs was closed and during this time these seals opened up and the trumpets blowed he said now in the blowing of the trumpets just before the Messiah comes he said because they've got to be in Palestine Oh my he said you remember God had to harden Pharaoh's heart run them out of Egypt he hardened Stalin muscolini and all that to get them back into the promised land where the 144,000 is supposed to be so what does he do he he he just the Jews come from everywhere to Israel that's why they're there today and brother brandham talked about that how they come out of Iran and all of those countries and now there are almost no Jews in the Middle East except for in Israel there's a reason for that cuz they got run out of every other place but but thank God there's a place for them I don't say this there's a place for us that's in Christ that's our place of safety they found out that their land wasn't as safe as they thought it was and they got to fight a war in their in their safe place and we're fighting a war in our safe place but our our bomb shelter is not concrete our bomb shelter is made out of feathers so it's the promises of God so uh so he gets him back into the promised land where the 144,000 is supposed to be now that's the nation of Israel had to be that that flag had to fly again there's a a three-fold purpose we know to the six seal we went over that last time I think that we taught on this brother R said the first fold was the purging of the sleeping virgin her sin of unbelief and rejecting the message the second was the purging of Israel he said out of the millions that'll gather there there'll be a selected 144,000 and it'll be purged also and then the purging of the Earth for the Millennium and that's from the seven seal where the random actually deals with that and gives a review of that now we know that something's fixing to happen Uh something's fixing to take place where things are moving things are changing and I thought it was interesting today but uh the nation of Israel at some point makes a covenant with the Antichrist now how many realize that they make a covenant they sue for peace right and and that happens now that happens I believe after we're gone now in Daniel 11:21 but but you can see it coming now in Daniel 11:21 it deals with the Antichrist and what he'll do we don't have time to go through all of this but we'll kind of skip through it uh he says in his estate shall stand up a vile person whom they shall not give the honor of the Kingdom but he shall come in peaceably and obtain the kingdom by flatteries and after the league made with him he shall work deceitfully so he'll say one thing and do another well you talk about a politician right there he shall come up he shall become strong with a small people he shall return into his land with great riches his heart shall his heart shall be I'm skipping through this his heart shall be against the Holy Covenant he shall do exploits return to his own land an arm shall stand on his part they shall pollute the sanctuary of strength shall take away the daily sacrifice that tells us that the daily sacrifice has been restored during that time they shall place the Abomination that maketh desolate and such as do wickedly against the Covenant shall be he corrupt by flatteries but the people that do know their God should be strong and do exploits we know that has a an application to us at the end time also has an application to the 144,000 Jews and verse 33 they that understand among the people shall instruct many yet they shall follow by the sword By Flame captivity by spoil many days now I want you to understand nothing like like this is written for the bride there's no scripture that says the bride's going to endure a great persecution at the end time or or a great uh time of trouble or great a Great Tribulation there's no scripture for that the only scripture is for the Jews and I believe that's what brother brandham taught because in when it comes to leacy and age he said we're you're rich and increase with goods and in such an hour as you think not yeah then your Lord comes but I'm glad we we've been given a window of Prophecy we can look and see the time's here it's time to get ready it's not time to mess around it's time to be serious about these things so they that understand will instruct many yet they'll fall by Flame by captivity by spoil and and some of them of understanding shall fall to try them and to purge to make them white so you and I don't have to be made white right we're already we already have white robes you remember the that's what brother Ram taught us we already have white robes but they were given white robes and these gained their uh their white robes by being purged during this tribulation period he said even to the time of the end because it is yet for a time appointed now we know that we're building up to all of this now we see Jerusalem compassed with armies and that's from the scripture in Luke 21:20 when you should see Jerusalem compassed with armies know the Desolation there of his n now brother Brandon said that that was literally fulfilled with Titus the Roman general Titus when he come in and those who were forewarned weren't there and the same thing's going to happen at the end time by the way when the tribulation period hits those who are forewarned won't be here that's us those who took a oh my took Jesus at his word they left he said don't remember he said don't uh pray that your flight not on the Sabbath day why cuz not one Christian was slaughtered not One True Believer was slaughtered during that time because they all left because they had the warning ahead of time so now uh but Roman uh the Roman general come and Compass Jerusalem with armies but now brother brandham says he said watch this closely he said you can see the difference he said I believe that Jerusalem will be compassed about with armies again at the end time we know that's coming there's going to come a time when every nation of the earth including this one is going to come against Israel and when they do huh we come back from the waiting supper and and the Lord fights for Israel right so that's during that tribulation period so we know that's going to happen as of right now we're standing with Israel so we know that we're you know but we're you see how quickly that could change look what happened this morning Hamas said oh there's a hospital been struck right by Israel and all the nations of the world condemned it immediately immediately they condemned it and then by this afternoon or sometime today we found out it wasn't Israel at all it was Hamas that did it to themselves now why why would they do something like that because uh they're turning public opinion one day it'll be completely turned right now and they're not above lying about it right aren't you glad we serve a God always tells the truth you want to know what the truth is you can't find on CNN or on Fox or anywhere else on the internet you find it in the word of God so now we see a prefigure of this a a covenant would be made uh we find uh uh Biden in Israel today and I thought it was interesting that America's First Catholic President is visiting Israel during a time of War it's the first time an American president has visited Israel during a war time and he's a Catholic all the things that need to be present at the time of that uh I'm not saying this is it I'm saying that all the parties that need to be present were present today that's right for that at for that Covenant to be made the Catholic Church the Jews and America those are the those are the ones that make a covenant now we know that uh because brother bandam said it would be a it would be they make a covenant of money and but we know that's coming church we know it's coming now America's uh First Catholic President was there today now when those armies surround Jerusalem are defeated at the end of the tribulation the remnant of the 144,000 will have a day of atonement Zechariah 12:10 I don't pretend to understand exactly how this will work but when they see him come back when they see him now it says I will pour upon the house I don't know if they'll I I don't know exactly how that will work I don't want to speculate he said I will pour upon the House of David and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit of Grace and of Supplication they shall look upon me whom they have pierced they shall mourn for him as one mourneth for his only son shall be in bitterness for him as one that is in bitterness for his first born brother brand said now he's speaking here of the remnant The Siege of Jerusalem the beasts and the armies is took away and so forth all things are become to the end now he said this is almost to the Millennium fixing to start the Millennium right now on that day of atonement is now uh reason I got thinking about this brother steuart asked me a good question the other day brother steuart if you're listening uh I told him something that I no longer believe after studying this but uh he asked me said will 144,000 will they all be killed uh during this time and at the time I've always thought they would be because he said your brethren have to be killed like you were right but some of them will be killed everything I can find some of them will be killed and not all of them and reason I say that because there's always a Remnant there's always a Remnant there's a remnant of Jews that come and there's got to be somebody there's got to be somebody populating the Earth other than us during the Millennium right because at the end of the Millennium they turn against right the nations of the Earth turn against Christ again and during the Battle of Gog and MOG so I believe that there's a Remnant believe there's a remnant of the foolish version a remnant of the 144,000 but you can take that believe it but these are the the quotes that I found about that he said he's speaking of the remnant he said this this covenant made with the Jews would probably be a money Covenant with Rome in America brother brand said that might not be so he said brother Ben why do we not know well there's so many things we don't know because we're not going to be here that's right right and brother Brandon was not the prophet to the Jews he was a prophet to the Gentiles so this would be a probably a money Covenant he said but I that may not be so he said see I know they'll break it he said but I don't know what reason because it's not revealed to me about what they'll do now uh there will be 144,000 Jews with the Seal of the Holy Ghost two prophets leading them and during that time the temple is rebuilt and sacrifice is allowed again and brother BR said now watch set up and set up to this he said the daily worship and sacrifice will come back into the city when the temple is rebuilt this Prince is to come in the middle of this week will break his Covenant and do away with the sacrifices he said he'll scatter it what he'll do it'll last on until the consummation this is during the time when the two prophets are killed resurrected and taken up right they're killed their dead bodies are left lying in the street all the nations of the world rejoice and then they're resurrected right in front of the people you talk about miracles there's Miracles coming but this nation has seen its last sign brother BR said the Pentecostal church was looking for great signs and wonders and it's all it was passed he said is to the Jews but we're we're right at the end what are we looking for a Rapture we're going home so this is the time when the two prophets are killed resurrected taken up and Revelation 11:12 they heard a great voice from Heaven saying un them come up hither ascended up to heaven in a cloud their enemies beheld them in the same hour there was a great earthquake I wonder if that might be that Earth California earthquake I don't know he said there was a great earthquake in the 10th part of the city fell and in the earthquake we're saying the men 7,000 The Remnant were frighted and gave glory to the god of Heaven notice there was a Remnant and so there's got to be somebody Liv during the Millennium now just a little while brother Brandon said we'll be summoned I love the way he sums this up in future home he said just a little while we'll be summoned yes amen he's just going to say come home it's time come home amen then the Rapture will come he said just a little bitty group like Enoch will be Tak taken up in the remnant of the woman seed that keep the Commandments of God Jews he said have the testimony of Jesus Christ Gentile was two groups he said we'll be hunted down like dogs and shall give their life for their testimony and one great morning the break of the Millennium for the honeymoon will start then the rest of the Dead Liv not till the end of the Thousand Years then he said at the end of the Thousand Years there was a judgment he said showing that ham was in the ark and ham is still there in the remnant so there's a Remnant and a remnant of a Remnant because 144,000 are the remnant of of of Israel and then there's a remnant of a Remnant he said but H was still in the remnant he said ones that heard it and rejected it will have to be judged finally the second Resurrection the white Throne judgment and then the new heavens and the new Earth now I want to point your attention to something tonight because I I know you're looking at this what in the world does this have to do with me and and really nothing just get ready H but but there's a there's a reason why brother Brandon points something out and it's important so I want to kind of turn this as we finish up in our last 15 minutes or so this evening now in Revelation 7 what we read we find that the tribes of Dan and Ephraim are missing among the tribes right you all know that you know what brother Bram taught about that maybe some of you don't but Dan and Ephraim are missing Joseph and Levi are substituted for Dan and Ephraim brother Brown said that was because the ever remembering God remembers every promise of his word he remembers the good and the bad and the thing is God doesn't let people get by with nothing right nothing we if we could just understand David one time got into a place where he felt like the wicked were getting by with a lot doesn't it feel like that sometimes God's people are under such distress and and good people suffer so much and and yet evil people don't suffer at all seems like they do well they just keep doing better and David got in that place he said I he said my feet stood in Slippery places because he started thinking about that he said but then I saw their end I saw their end I saw I saw what God was going to do see God repays everything he don't owe nobody nothing he pays to each one their debt and each one is judged according to their works and I'm so glad to be a part of the Bride I'm so glad that I was judged here and and I was covered by the blood of Jesus Christ my sins were washed away done away with not even in his mind anymore and you're either in that bride or you're not right I want I want by faith I believe I'm in it I would never believe anything else ever remembering God remembers every promise of his word if he remembers this a promise that's bad he'll remember a promise that's good right now any tribe that committed the sin of idolatry was to be blotted out from from under Heaven idolatry is a serious thing we don't want to put anything up before God we don't worship nothing before God Amen Deuteronomy 29:20 is where you find that the Lord will not spare him he said but then the anger of the Lord and his jealous jealousy shall smoke against that man all the curses are written in this book shall lie upon him the Lord shall blot out his name from under Heaven the Lord shall separate him un evil out of all the tribes of Israel according to all the curses of the Covenant that are written in this book of the law BR said Dan and Ephraim did just that under a hypocrite of a king in Israel and impostor jeroboam wish we had time to go into it jeroboam was a paranoid Pastor he thought the people were all going to go leave him and go off and worship in Jerusalem because they had a church split and so he didn't want them to go to the meeting so he said let's set up a different Idol let's set up a different Idol he was a king not a pastor but you understand what I'm saying you know sometimes paranoia can can lead to a lot of bad results so and you find that in First Kings 12 he set up Golden Cals and Dan and Ephraim Dan and Ephraim were blotted out from under the heavens now but if you go back oh you imagine God you think God forgets I think about it all these years later we're talking 3,000 years in between the time when this happens and the end times maybe more because we don't know exactly when the 144,000 will be there all these years later he remembers that Dan and Ephraim worshiped a golden calf you think God don't remember your your sin needs to be under the blood don't think that you're just going to get by with it keep on doing it and and keep on doing what you're doing everything's going to be okay we must put our sins under the blood yes it must be blotted out or will be blotted out we can't go in just on well I've been pretty good that don't work so all these years later he remembers and their names were blotted out from under the the heavens but if you go and I don't have time to read it but if you go to Ezekiel 48 and Revelation 14 you'll find them back in their original order brother BR said that was because God rich in Mercy oh aren't you glad he's rich in Mercy he blotted them out from under the heavens but not in the heavens they were still the elect yes oh God so he blotted them out he takes them out from this revival of this 14 4,000 but in the end they're still there you understand in the Millennium they're still there in the uh in the resurrection whatever the general Resurrection they're still there they're back in their original order their names were blotted out under the heavens not in heaven now watch this real close before we close the Gentile age is different do you realize God deals with us harsher than he did them brother said the Gentile in the days of the Holy Spirit he said you against that your name was taken completely out off The Book of Life and could never have forgiveness in this world or the world to come he said so that's where we stand he takes that from Mark chapter 3: 28 verily I send you all sins shall be forgiven to the sons of men and blasphemies whatsoever they shall blaspheme he that shall blaspheming against the Holy Ghost hath never forgiveness but is in danger of Eternal damnation so we need to make sure we need to make sure make our election and calling sure we need to be careful what we laugh at what we make fun of right right it's serious true and there's coming a day when The Mercy Seat changes to a judgment seat when for the Gentiles you understand for the G it's already happened in this way that that the denominations don't have a seed of Mercy anymore but the mercy is found in the unveiled word you'll find that in the unveil in of Christ and mighty God unveiled before us that we we know that the access to Mercy has changed in this hour You've Got to Believe the full word nothing less you can't be you can't be saved under anything less than the full lamb yes there was a time you winked at ignorance but not today but I'm saying that not to scare you tonight because I I think actually this is is a positive thing I think many people don't understand it and they think well maybe you know I've been had trouble praying lately I can't force myself to go to church and it feels like it's hard anybody ever felt like that well the rest some of us are honest sometimes you feel lost don't you just be I mean I'm just being honest sometimes you feel like well maybe God dealt with me one day but he doesn't deal with me anymore and we don't go by feelings we go by faith that's right right but but many times well well maybe God maybe God dealt with me back then but maybe he's quit dealing with me maybe I've crossed the line maybe I've taken the mark of the beast and didn't know it now I want to kind of put that out of our minds before we go because it's important how do I know if I've crossed the line is there still Mercy for me I I know there's still Mercy for the Earth but the brand said there was he said don't you ever ever think Mercy's over said keep on preaching keep on evangelizing right but is there still Mercy for me now brother brandom talks about people during his meetings who've crossed the line that that really in one place in one quote that I found where the said that lady last night said she crossed the line yes said that Darkness came over and it was her last chance to repent it's a serious thing but Satan you know his job is to deceive us yes that's what he does best so what he does is tries to make you think you've crossed the line so you won't accept mercy so you won't accept judgment how do you know now brother brandham he's dealing with somebody in a prayer line I think this is instructive to us before we go here I I just felt to do this tonight and he talking to somebody who felt like maybe they crossed the line you know when sometimes people don't quit coming to church but they still feel like they're just not good enough yeah like somehow they've crossed some sort of line that God's just never going to deal with them like he does everybody else because of something that they've done or someplace that they've been or listen to me he loves you tonight yes he wants to deal with you he wants to work in your heart he wants to work in your family you just got to surrender yourself to him sir but now but people feel that way many times I've felt that way before just something you just feel like well God hasn't spoken to me in a while I I just maybe he don't love me no more he does love us now brother brand would dealing this prayer line he said how do you do sir now there's there's something strange about you sir Satan has desired to take your life you're all tore up you think you've sended away your day of Grace you think your life is ruined and I love how simple brother brandom is about this we over complicate things don't we we were talking about that back in the office even with our children many times we over complicate things look how simple how simple God has been dealing with our children and wanting to be baptized wan to be right with God I said let's just accept the Simplicity of that but here in this simple way Brother bandam Talks to the person he said you think your life is ruined do you love Jesus what makes you love him oh my yeah but I've done this I've done that I I feel like I feel like I'm just like them Jews I I've been taken out from blotted out from under the heavens but he still had mercy even on them in the end but I realize there's a place you can cross the line I realize that but do you love Jesus if you do you haven't crossed the line what what makes you love him he said before there could be anything there to make you love him there has to be a Creator to create the love in your heart amen he said is that right if you'd send away your day of Grace you would hate Jesus but you love him and you're all right yes amen he said and the devil's just lying to you you're nervous he said come here I'll cast him away for you if you'll believe Hallelujah brother brandone bowed down he prays for the boy and he said ow you're all right he said now you can raise your head feel all right now son is that right Devils he said you you'd have committed suicide in a few days he said that was on his mind you imagine a boy getting that place he think well God don't love me no more so much so he thought he was going to take his own life he said that was on his mind he thought he sned away his day of Grace don't ever think that brother brandom talked about that woman in the restaurant you remember the story I don't have time to read it all brother Brandon talked about that woman there was the the bumper of of the blood of God he had a vision he saw a woman sitting there with policeman gambling carrying on smoking and he had the vision of of Christ he said there was a like a bumper of blood going around the earth and every time a one of his sins would go up he said it would hit that and he would just Flinch he say is that the sins of the world he said no that's your sin every one of us would be lost without that and so he goes up to the woman it's interesting what she said to him because she told him she'd been raised in a good family she was raised in a Holiness Church Wesleyan Church and she was sitting there in the restaurant and she's gone so far away from the way she was raised that she said I and sometimes I think our young people feel like this because we raise them to to fear God and so when they get older and they do some things that are wrong and and she said I I've send away my day of Grace I know that there's people who watch these services that used to go to church here young people that used to go to church here and I know sometimes they feel like well I can't ever go back I my life's been messed up since I left I've done so many things listen he still loves you you wouldn't be watching If he if he didn't love you you wouldn't care if he didn't love you he said he told this woman she said I've send away my day of Grace I said look do you still have respect for the Lord Jesus she said I do sir I said then he hasn't left youen said no he still got Mercy for you oh my yeah I told you this would have something to do with us see that they Dan and Ephraim crossed the line were left out for 3,000 years but you haven't crossed the line not if you love Jesus brother Bram dealt with a man who thought he'd cross the line it was that man who you remember the story he went down to the Baptist church and they told him believe take the the preacher saying he did that he didn't feel right he went down to the Methodist church and they told him you need to be Sanctified and beat him on the back at the altar and he went down there he didn't feel right down to the Pentecostal church and they told him you need to speak with tongues and and you'll be you'll get it you'll have the Holy Ghost in and he spoke with tongues didn't feel right and they said well you must have a devil said you may have send away your day of Grace you better go to brother brandom and he'll He he'll deal with you he's got a gift of a prophet oh my yeah he come to brother Bram he said brother brandham he said I think I've send away my day of Grace I just can't feel right he didn't ask you if you felt it said Do you believe it he he said I I just can't feel like I'm saved and brother brandom told him he said you remember when you were at the car lot and you picked up that thing and said uh where will you spend eternity and he said that something struck your heart and you began to seek the Lord he he said you remember that and he began to to talk to him he said then brother brandom I've been saved all the time I said sure look I said do you love him he said with all my heart I said one time you didn't love him said that's right said now you love him he said well that's the truth he said well you had him all the time church it's that simple you say have I have I send away my day of Grace not if you love him if you love him you can you can have the Holy Ghost if you love him you can be as much a Christian as anybody else Just Surrender yourself to him let him in let him in every door every one of them don't hold anything back when you see these these wrecks along the highway it's because they held something back preachers that that wreck along the highway they held something back they didn't give him everything people that have left and and left the message Alto together why they didn't give him everything it's time we sold out it's time we got serious as long as we're here there will be Mercy musicians go ahead and come but let's get serious about these things let's be more sincere people are hurting everywhere I realize that right now Satan is attacking the ministry in this message with with all that he's got but now's the time to pick up our swords and fight that's right I know for some faith is being shaken but everything that can be shaken will be shaken but not those that can't Paul says I'm he said I've heard a different report of you he said you're not of those who go back but of them who believe to the saving of the soulen some people becoming more and more extreme whatever Doctrine whatever thing that they believe only those planted by the rivers of Living Water will not be moved don't you want to be one of those man God bless you thank you for being patient with me tonight I I know it was different could you bow your heads with me maybe we'll have a prayer I don't know maybe those watching someone could be benefited by that I touch my heart sometimes to see people watch and people come and they don't know what we're talking about maybe so maybe some do but they just feel like well I just can't be a Christian I just can't live it I believe you can I believe the blood of Jesus is so powerful he can reach down where you're at and cleanse you of your sin take all the desire to sin out of your life make you whole again I believe in that kind of a power I believe in that kind of an experience I believe he he wants to do that for you maybe someone's sitting here tonight you're dealing with something in your life and something in your heart something in your body you like prayer let's just all pray together and we'll just believe the Lord will take care of every one of those situations amen I I've got things I need from the Lord I know there's some needs that can't even be spoken that there's just things that we need let's just pray about those things Heavenly Father oh Lord we love you tonight we thank you Lord for creating that love in our hearts Lord I know this service has been quiet and simple but Lord I
