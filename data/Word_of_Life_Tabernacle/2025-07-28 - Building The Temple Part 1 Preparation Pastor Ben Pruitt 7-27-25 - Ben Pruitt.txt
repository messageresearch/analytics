If you can be seated for just a moment. I brother Harvey has a testimony want to give this morning and we're going to take time for him to do that. It's just a wonderful testimony of God's healing power. I know we got about a dozen testimonies or so from the meetings that were just amazing. And uh I want to thank you for sharing those with us. My goodness. Uh it just God just moved in miraculous ways. So as brother Harvey comes, we have him do that uh this morning. And uh and also I wanted to say to you young people, if you haven't signed up yet for the youth banquet, we got several coming from out of town. And so it's going to be a good time on the 16th of August. Um and uh we're going to have a good time there at the banquet here at the fellowship hall. So if you could come and and be a part of that. I know most of ours have signed up, but if you haven't signed up yet and you want to come to the youth banquet, you're welcome to do that. God bless you, brother Harvey. Amen. How many love the Lord this morning? &gt;&gt; Man, I'm just rejoicing with y'all for what the Lord has done for us. And I just had a testimony. It's kind of burning. So, I thought I would go ahead and try to give it. I'll try not to take too much of brother Ben's time. &gt;&gt; Uh about 12, 13 years ago, I was given some medicine that caused my uh joints to go out, caused them to be bad, and I had both my hips replaced. And the doctor told me at that time, he said, "Sunny, your shoulders are gone, too." He said, "Your your shoulder is in bad a shape as your hips was." So, I recovered from the surgeries from the hips and I had prayer for my shoulder. This my right shoulder was the worst one. And the Lord healed it. He just miraculously I had no trouble with it. I never went back and had any test or anything, but I was able to use it miraculously. But about three months ago, I uh injured myself, injured my left shoulder, and uh I tried everything I could to to make it work, and I just couldn't make it work. I tried physical therapy, and it just didn't respond. And then I fell on it, took a really hard fall on it, and it uh it went south from there. So, I decided I was going to have to have something done. So, I went to the doctor and he told me, he said, "Son, you got a a to rotor cup." He said, "I don't know how bad it is." He said, "I talked to brother Bill and I know he had went through that surgery." He said, "We might can fix it with a scope." He said, "We might have to go in there, but he said, "I'm sure that's what your problem is." So, we uh I got to looking and I looked at some pictures of what a toer cup looked like. And by the time I went to see the doctor, I pretty well knew what I was what he was talking about. So, we got in there. Sister Rebecca was in the hospital the day I went and had some tests done. this you I was in pain that day a lot of pain but I just couldn't do anything with it and it really hindered me because I couldn't do my couldn't do my job I didn't feel like I took care of you people I was really during the meetings I was like a one-armed person and it wasn't wasn't very much and I really felt bad about that and and so in the prayer line Saturday night uh I come through the prayer line and my thought was Lord however you want to do this if it's a big tear you can fix that. If it's a little one, well, that'd be good, too. Or just whatever your wheel is. And I told Brother Daryl when we started the line, he was at the front and I said, "Brother Daryl, the doctor says, I've got a tore rotor cup." And he stopped. He said, "Well, let me tell you something." He said, "I just got a report from a sister that the Lord healed of that." &gt;&gt; And I said, "Well, praise the Lord." You know, and I wasn't asking for a miracle or anything. I went through the line and uh the next morning I got up and Monday, Monday morning I had an MRI at 7:00 at Mountain Home. So I got up and I had half the pain was 50% was gone and I was just I was just amazed, you know, all the way over there. And I went and done that MRI. Immediately went to the doctor and they put me in a little room and they, you know how they do with the technology, they put the X-rays and then the MRI, they put it on the screen where you can see it. &gt;&gt; And that was I was in there 10, 15 minutes before the doctor come in. And I looked at that joint. I couldn't see nothing. &gt;&gt; I knew what a tour cup looked like because I'd been looking at them, you know, and I couldn't find a thing. He come in and he looked over it and he said, Well, Harvey, he said, "I don't find anything to fix." He said, "Let me uh" said, "Let me see what they said about it over at the hospital." So, he reads all that. He looked at me and he said, "There's just nothing here to fix." He said, in fact, he said, "That joint," he said, "that joint looks better than most of the men at your age come in here that has a a joint." He said, "That joint looks better than most joints I've seen." He said, he said, "Connie protocol." He said, "We can give you a shot in that shoulder." He said, "It ain't going to do you no good because he said there's nothing wrong with it." I said, "Whatever you think you need to do, doctor." And I just I just want I throw that in because I want to say something here. Anyway, I come out of there and ever since then, I've been able to use that hand. I can do anything I want to with it. Perfect range of motion. &gt;&gt; And I just I hated it so bad. It's just lots of times you need more than one hand to praise the Lord. We come into a lot of those situations during the meetings and I just felt so bummed because I couldn't do what I wanted to do. But uh he he give me that shot and I witnessed to people after that and I had some to say you know they didn't mean it bad but I'd tell them my testimony and then the first thing they would ask well how long's that shot post supposed to last? And I thought, you know, devil, that's just like the devil. But the Lord done pulled one over on him because I had done seen what my shoulder looked like. I done seen the complete healed joint. &gt;&gt; So the devil had he had no power with that at all. And I just want to thank him this morning for what he done for us. There's been a lot of requests or a lot of testimonies that come through that prayer line, but I believe the Lord was here and I believe that he's confirmed what he said he would do. And I'm thankful for the recipant of that this morning. Thank you. Amen. You believe God the healer. &gt;&gt; How many believe that this morning? &gt;&gt; If you have a need this morning, he's able to meet our need this morning. &gt;&gt; He can heal you anywhere. But there was just such expectation for the prayer line. Let's stand together and sing only believe. Do you believe this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe the same God is here. &gt;&gt; Amen. If we have that same expectation this morning, my God is still a healer. He's still a savior. He's Baby's looking at me. You're going to make me emotional. My goodness, God's done such wonderful things for us. [Music] &gt;&gt; I wonder if we could be like the one leper that came back and said, "I'm going worship you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to be all like all the ones that just took their healing and went on, but I'm going to worship you. I'm going to praise you for what you've done. Let's just sing this together as we prepare to go to the word. Only believe. Only believe. Oh, all things if you'll only believe. Sing it now. Only believe. Only believe. All things are possible if you only believe. Lord, I believe. Oh Lord, [Music] I believe. Oh Lord, I believe. All things. [Music] Lord, I believe. Oh Lord, I believe. Oh yes, Lord. Oh Lord, I believe. All things are possible. Oh Lord, I believe. &gt;&gt; Can we bow our heads together for a moment? Heavenly Father, we're so thankful, oh God, thankful for your healing power. Thankful for your grace here this morning. I pray, Lord, that there'd be one here in the sound of my voice that doesn't know you like they ought to. I pray that you'd reveal them yourself to them this morning. Lord, if there's one here in need of healing, I pray you'd heal them. And Lord, we all need a stirring in our hearts. God, we thank you for doing that in the meeting. But Lord, today is another day. We need to be stirred again, Lord. Our faith to be increased. Pray that you'd grant that this morning. If there's anything or that we do that is wrong, I pray you'd forgive us. We thank you for all that you've done in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Thank the Lord. God bless you this morning. We're going to turn in the scriptures to 1 Coronicles chapter 17 and verse one. 1 Chronicles 17 and 1. I don't uh mean to keep you standing this morning, but there's a little bit of a a reading. I want to read this first 14 verses. So, just bear with us for a moment. 1 Chronicles 17 verse one says, "Now it came to pass as David sat in his house that David said to Nathan the prophet, oh, I dwell in a house of cedars, but the ark of the covenant of the Lord remainth under curtains." Nathan said unto David, "Do all that is in thine heart, for God is with thee." And it came to pass the same night the word of God came to Nathan, saying, "Go tell David, my servant, thus sayith the Lord, thou shalt not build me a house to dwell in. I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought up Israel unto this day, but have gone from tent to tent, and from one tabernacle to another. Whatsoever I have walked with all Israel, spake I a word to any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people, saying, Why have you not built me a house of cedars? He said, "Now therefore, thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, thus sayith the Lord of hosts, I took thee from the sheep coat, even from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be ruler over my people Israel, and I have been with thee, whethersoever thou hast walked, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee, made thee a name like the name of the great men that are in the earth." He said, "Also, I will ordain a place for my people Israel, and I will plant them, and they shall dwell in their place, and shall be moved no more. Neither shall the children of wickedness waste them anymore as at the beginning. And since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel, moreover, I will subdue all thine enemies. He said, "Furthermore, I tell thee that the Lord will build thee a house. It shall come to pass when thy days be expired that thou must go to be with thy fathers, I will raise up thy seed after thee, which shall be of thy sons. I will establish his kingdom, and he shall build me a house, and I will establish his throne forever." are speaking of Solomon also of Christ. He said, "I will be his father, and he shall be my son. I will not take my mercy away from him as I took it from him that was before thee, but I will settle him in my house and in my kingdom forever, and his throne shall be established forever more." God bless you can have your seats this morning. I want to speak to you this morning if God will give me grace and let me do it and if we'll listen closely and then tonight as well I'd like to uh speak on building the temple. So if you can listen carefully and then tonight uh we'll we'll continue. David had a desire to do something and that desire that he had was a good thing. It wasn't a a bad thing. It wasn't a evil thing but it was a good thing. something actually that needed to be done. Yeah, &gt;&gt; it was something that God was going to do. And so he wanted to build God a house, but God said, "No, David." He said, "I don't want you build the house." He said, he said, "Your son will build the house." And it's hard sometimes to hear that that, "Well, it's not going to happen in my generation, but the next generation is going to take it on." And so he told him that and David had learned through bringing back the ark that there are five musts when it comes to the will of the Lord and doing something for God because brother Brandon preached a sermon called trying to do God a service without being the will of God. He said it has to be his time his season when he said it would be and the man that he chose and it must come to the prophet and the prophet must be a vindicated prophet. &gt;&gt; Right? So those are the five musts that had to be in order for something to be done. And so the job was right to do, but David was not the man that God ordained to do it. But brother said David desired to build him a house. But God seen the motive of the prophet. He seen the motive of the king and and their objectives. He said, "Go tell my servant David, who was he? I took him out of the sheep coat from following a few sheep. He made a king out of him. He said, brother Brandon says, what did he take you people from? I think all of us could look at that this morning and say, he brought me out of nothing into something. &gt;&gt; He brought me out of out of sin and darkness and the world and whatever it was that I was and whatever it was that that I was doing. And he made something out of my life. &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful for that today. Amen. &gt;&gt; He brought David out of the sheep coat, out of the barn, &gt;&gt; brought him to be a king of Israel. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; So he said, "What did he bring you from?" And I made him a name like great names. And brother Brandham gets personal with that. And he begins to talk about it from a personal perspective. He said, "When the Lord showed me that one day, I thought, oh God, what could I be? A poor little preacher back there. Never know more than Jeffersonville. One day by my cave, the Lord turned that to me and the first time I ever read it, he said, "I give you a great name like Oral Roberts or Billy Graham," he said, "Where did I get you from? What was you, but I just can't let you build a temple?" &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Now, think about this for a moment. Brother Brandham didn't leave us a temple. &gt;&gt; He didn't leave us a great building. &gt;&gt; He didn't leave us a a a legacy in stone or in writing. What did he leave us? A message. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. But but he said, "I can't let you build a temple." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because I'm going to let your son build it. &gt;&gt; He said, "For it was in types and shadows." Now, I know some people believe that was brother Brandham's natural son, but look what brother Brandham says. &gt;&gt; He said Solomon built him a temple, but the true son of David is Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; that built the real temple. How many are glad for him today? that was born of virgin birth and in his body is the everlasting temple of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So it was a type. Brother Brandon, God showing brother Brandon, I'm not going to let you build the temple. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He said, I'm going to let your son or I'm going to let the son of God, I'm going to let Jesus Christ build the temple. &gt;&gt; You see, David's job was to prepare for the temple. That's what I want to talk about this morning. Preparation. And we're preparing for something coming. &gt;&gt; Preparing for something in the future. It's a very difficult thing to do. When you think about maybe not even doing something that's going to benefit your generation, but something that would benefit the next generation. Some of you older folks know what I'm talking about today. You know, your life maybe is getting close to the end. And and you realize you got more behind you than you do ahead of you. And you have to look at that and think, well, you know, maybe we just need to rest for a while and and sit still for a while. not do anything cuz it won't benefit me anyhow. But there's somebody coming behind you. It may not be for this generation to build a temple. But there's a temple being built. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; So there had to be a preparation made. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; For the temple that was coming. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; John the Baptist had that same job. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He had to prepare to build to the temple. He was a preparation. In Isaiah 43, it says, "The voice of him that crith in the wilderness, prepare ye the way of the Lord." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. Make straight in the desert a highway for our God. Malachi 3:1, "Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me, and the Lord whom you seek shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant whom you delight in." He said, "Behold, he shall come, sayeth the Lord of hosts." And in Matthew chapter 3, it speaks of John said, "In those days came John the Baptist preaching in the wilderness of Judea and saying,"Repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah, saying, the voice of one crying in the wilderness, prepare you the way of the Lord. Make his path straight." &gt;&gt; Oh my. So John's message wasn't about John, &gt;&gt; but it was about preparing the way for the one coming. All right. &gt;&gt; Preparing the way for the one who was the temple of the almighty God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So look what look what he says in John chapter 1 verse 29. The next day John sees Jesus coming unto him and sitha behold the lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world. Look what he pointed to. He he's paved the way. He's made the way clear. He he he's reorganized the minds of the people and the hearts of the people. turn the hearts of the fathers back to the children. And there was to come one in this hour that turned the hearts of the children back to the fathers. &gt;&gt; But what was it? A preparation. What did he turn our hearts back for? To receive. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The presence of God, the the the dwelling place of God. &gt;&gt; Which was Jesus Christ himself. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. So to receive Christ now which the temple the earthly temple was just a a type of. So John says behold the lamb of God. John 3:26 says they came unto John and this is after he had announced him and said unto him rabbi he that was with thee beyond Jordan to whom thou beest witness behold the same baptizeth and all men come to him. Now they're looking at him. They're coming to John like this said, "Hey, your ministry is going downhill and his ministry is increasing. &gt;&gt; Your ministry is dying." And that's the time when most men would actually begin to attack. Remember what Saul did? Saul looked at David and said, "I see my ministry going down, my kingship going down, his kingship coming up, and so now it's time to attack. Now it's the time to throw spears at him." &gt;&gt; Right? And we don't want to do that as an older generation as I've come to identify with you elders very much in the church. And &gt;&gt; thank you, brother Gabe. You know, I identify with the young people for so long and now I come to identify more with the elders as I get older. And I found that that as elders, we we tend to uh we we tend to look at the young people coming up and say, "Well, you know, we we did it better and uh we had more and things were just better back in the day." You know, back in my day, my kids laugh whenever I get to talking about the way it was. And and the truth is, we leave some things out. Amen. &gt;&gt; We just leave some things plum out of the picture. We tell them how hard it was, but we don't always tell them about the help we got, you know, and we tell them how we walked uphill, you know, both ways to school through 5t of snow and it was so difficult, you know, and we don't always tell them everything. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And and and and we don't always recognize what they're going through. and &gt;&gt; and and yet there's something for us to do because &gt;&gt; we're not just concerned about our generation we're living in right now. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But we're concerned about there's a temple coming. &gt;&gt; Christ is coming back to the earth. You believe that? &gt;&gt; Right. And he's coming. We we go through the rapture and then he comes back three and a half years later. His feet step on Mount Olives. We believe that. We believe in a literal Jesus Christ. But the Bible said that's what believers believe. Yes. &gt;&gt; So, we're preparing a way. &gt;&gt; We're making a way for the rapture, a way for these things to happen. Brother Brandham taught us this. He said, "If it doesn't happen in my generation, let me help the next generation. Don't let me stand in somebody else's way that's got faith enough to grab a hold of of the rapture." &gt;&gt; But I believe it'll happen in our generation. I I believe that with all of my heart. I believe some of you elders going to see the coming of the Lord. I believe that's why he's let you live. I really believe that, Sister Fritz. I believe you're going to see the coming of the Lord. But if you don't, you paved the way for another generation of believers. And look, come on, church. Another generation of people that can that can be what God called them to be. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Now look, John's attitude towards this meant he was the perfect one for that job. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; They said, "All men come to him." And John answered and said, "A man can receive nothing except to be given him from heaven. He said, 'You yourselves bear me witness that I said I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him. &gt;&gt; He that hath the bride is the bridegroom, but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoicth greatly because of the bridegroom's voice. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; This my joy therefore is fulfilled. &gt;&gt; He must increase, &gt;&gt; right? But I must decrease. &gt;&gt; And I want to deal with that this morning in a in a very personal way and maybe and we'll deal with the meaning of it, the actual meaning of it. But but if you want to think about it like this that every one of us as individuals, you know, brother Brandham taught us when you're 18 or 21, something in that in that realm, you begin to die. Amen. &gt;&gt; You've increased &gt;&gt; and now you decrease. &gt;&gt; And so when you reach an age where you begin to marry and have children and and things begin to happen in your life, you take on a different role. Instead of care being cared for, you care for others. &gt;&gt; You're really the rest of your life, what you're doing is setting things up for another generation to come. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You don't just live for yourself, &gt;&gt; right? You live for others, &gt;&gt; right? That's the way all of us do. Especially those of us who are married, have families, we live, our whole lives are for others, &gt;&gt; right? And that's really the way to find happiness yourself is to try to live for other people. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That's eternal life. Brother Brandham taught us. But he said he must increase. So we have to decrease. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; To make way for him to increase. &gt;&gt; So we decrease. We give you. You mothers give to your children. &gt;&gt; You give of yourselves. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; And you decrease yourself &gt;&gt; from your time &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; from your emotions &gt;&gt; from your own body, right? When you have a child, you you decreased given of yourself, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; So the baby can increase. &gt;&gt; You realize there's and I didn't intend to say this this morning, but did you realize there's a demographic crisis in America right now? because we're we're not having enough children. Not in this church. Praise God. But &gt;&gt; there are I got to counting the other day. There are right now 47 children in the church younger than Peter. &gt;&gt; I thank God for that. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's all right. I guess we're applauding the parents. But I really do, you know, I I thank God for that because but we got a great responsibility. Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. But what you do with your children, there's this crisis of de demographics because we are not having enough children in America right now. We're below replacement level. &gt;&gt; And what that means is the next generation coming on is going to have to pay for more social security than what our generation did. the one after that and by 2050 it's going to go bankrupt according to the numbers. &gt;&gt; It'll go bankrupt because they you don't have enough children being born, &gt;&gt; right? To to cover for the elders. Even though it looks like the world's overpop populated, we've reached a tipping point in the world where we're actually the population starting to go down. And over the next hundred years, as the Lord carries, the population is going down. Why? They they figured they said, "Why? People have more money. People have more food. Why are they having less children? So they went out and started interviewing these these parents or these people that were married and they said,"Wh aren't you having children?" They said, "Well, we chose not to." Because we chose to live our lives without the bother &gt;&gt; of children. &gt;&gt; Cuz children are a bother. &gt;&gt; But what they're saying is, I'm I'm going to stay increased as long as I can. I'm gonna keep my youth and my beauty and everything as long as I can so that so that everybody else, you know, and I'm not going to decrease myself to to increase another. But that's not the way the world works. Not even in the natural is not the way it works. And it's sure not how the church works. How how the bride of Christ should look at things. We should say, "Lord, help me to decrease. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Help me to be the soil &gt;&gt; that the next generation can be planted in. &gt;&gt; Come on. Let my mistakes be stepping stones. &gt;&gt; Let my let my life be a be a a beacon of light that other people might be able to see it. The next generation can see and say, "Yes, they made mistakes, but they overcome. They were sick, but God healed them. They were they were upset and weary, but God kept them through that time." And when they see our lives, they can step on that and go on to something greater. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Let our lives be the soul. We must decrease. &gt;&gt; Right? So that Christ, &gt;&gt; the temple of God, can increase &gt;&gt; even in our own children &gt;&gt; in our church. What did John the Baptist do? Brother said, "The man that Jesus said there was never a man born of a woman like him or could compare with him until that time. Great prophet ordained of God before the foundation of the world." I feel his presence here this morning. I I believe he's here even in the preaching of the word. He said he's the great prophets ordained, spoke of 712 years before he came to the earth by the prophet Isaiah. What did he do when he seen a man come walking down out of the audience and he looked up above and saw that fire coming down from heaven in the form of a dove? He cried out, "I have need to be baptized of thee. &gt;&gt; I must decrease. He must increase." God can't have two on the earth at the same time. Only one has the message. You know, I must decrease. He is the messenger. Oh my. I've been up to this time. Now he takes my place. As Elisha, when Elijah went up and throw back his robe to Elisha, his ministry was finished. Elisha must take up where he left off. He must increase. I must decrease. John the Baptist. Brother Brandham takes that to a startling place. He says, "Be conscious of your littleness." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; God had to have a prophet in John the Baptist who was conscious of his littleness. &gt;&gt; He had to have a prophet in this hour who was conscious of his littleness. Be conscious of your littleness. You're nothing. &gt;&gt; I know it's hard to hear, &gt;&gt; right? No, I'm not saying saying that I think you're nothing. I'm telling you what the reality is of the of the gospel that these flesh bodies were nothing. &gt;&gt; He said, "How I'd like to dwell on that in a few minutes, but you're nothing." He said, "If you want to find out how great you are, put your finger down on a pool of water, a bucket of water, pull your finger out, try to find where you put your finger." &gt;&gt; He said, "You're nothing. God can do without you. He can do without me." &gt;&gt; Look at the attitude that brother Brandham had. He didn't say, "Well, I'm the seventh angel messenger. I'm the one that God called. I'm the I'm Elijah that was to come. My ministry is to foreer the coming of Christ. God, he has to have me. That's not the attitude that he took. But he said, "Oh my," He said, "God can do without you. He can do without me, sir, &gt;&gt; but we can't do without him." &gt;&gt; We've got to have him. How many can say amen to that this morning? I've got to have him. We've got to have him. &gt;&gt; For he is life and he alone. &gt;&gt; Not to know his book, not to know this or know that or know the creed, but to know him is life. Know him as the person Christ in you, the word made flesh in you. That's knowing him. When you and he become one, he said like I said in the super sign, he has to got to come in you. You God and man must become one. You're conscious &gt;&gt; of your littleness. &gt;&gt; Again, he said, look at John. No selfishness in him. He never took any glory. They tried to call him the Messiah, but he said, I'm not worthy to loose his shoes. But as soon as Jesus appeared, he had a sign, a pillar of fire, a light above him, like a dove come down, a voice saying, "This is my beloved son, whom I'm well pleased." Notice, and John immediately said, "He must increase, I must decrease." He presented the church, sir, &gt;&gt; to Christ. &gt;&gt; We're told that in the last days, he said that will repeat again. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; There is going to be a message come forth, sir. that will introduce the Messiah to the people. What did he say would introduce Messiah to the people? &gt;&gt; The message. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Now, I want to ask you the question. Has it done it? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We can testify for a little while. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Has it done it? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Some of you all know brother JT was working in a shoe factory but the Messiah was introduced to him &gt;&gt; by the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; When he found out about the message, he wasn't finding out just about a prophet and what he did and what his habits were and and where he lived. But what was he finding out? He was finding about a message that came through a prophet. And when he found out, come on. So many of you, you remember the time when you were you you come to the message of the hour. What were you coming to? You weren't coming to a a form or a fashion. You were coming to the word to Christ. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It was more than just a story. The Mormons have stories. Jehovah's Witness have stories. They got a a program. They got things to say. But this was more than that. This was Christ. &gt;&gt; Very good. &gt;&gt; And so the message came to him. A message came that would introduce the Messiah to the people. He said it'll be in such a way they'll stand dumbfounded like they did then. He said he promised it and they do and they send say well we're waiting on brother Brandham &gt;&gt; to introduce us to Christ which I believe that we'll be we'll meet him with our messenger. I do believe that. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? He'll be resurrected and we'll be caught up with him &gt;&gt; with all the saints &gt;&gt; together in a general resurrection. Not a private resurrection, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But in a general resurrection we'll be caught up together to meet them our Lord in the air. We're taught that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. Each one will come up with his group. Right. I I believe I'll be introduced with you people. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. And the other brothers that have worked in your lives, the ministry that you've listened to, we'll be introduced together. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. As a group, and then we'll go on up and and there'll be our our messenger introduced with with the Leoian church age. &gt;&gt; I believe that's going to happen. &gt;&gt; But we've already been introduced to Christ the word by the message. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. It has to have happened. Other words, other words, he could not have decreased. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? God couldn't have took him off the scene. &gt;&gt; We still needed him. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. But what we didn't realize is and and Lord knows if he was here this morning, if he was anywhere on the earth this morning, I'd be wherever he was. &gt;&gt; Right? And I think many of you feel the same way. But he's not here for a reason because God said, "I'm going to let him introduce the message." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And then a prophet said, "I must decrease that he might increase." Yes. &gt;&gt; Now look, the message, this message was the unveiling of God. Go listen to the unveiling of God. Mighty God unveiled before us. This message unveiled God to us. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. And and and and the books and the tapes are not God. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; God speaks through those things. &gt;&gt; But that's not the God. This pulpit's not God. I'm This flesh is not God. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon's flesh was not God. That's right. &gt;&gt; But it was God speaking through a prophet. God speaking through the message of the hour. God speaking through a ministry today who say what he said. &gt;&gt; Right. It's the same God. What is it? The unveiling of God. We can see God with skin on him. God tearing the veil or ripping the veil until the mercy seat which is in your heart comes in plain view. &gt;&gt; So he did it on the reformers taking on a veil. He said brother said he always took on a veil until finally come down through the Lutheran age down through the other age finally comes out into the complete. He said just before it comes a prophet arises again what it does it foreshadows the word showing back here revealing what's been done what's been left off that the church would not be without understanding and when this fades out he said then like John said I must decrease he must increase then all it all comes into him. &gt;&gt; Come on &gt;&gt; he is fully manifested. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Oh hallelujah through Luther Wesley Pentecostal age on down on down he's fully manifested you see coming down just the manifestation God unfolding see him now notice fulfilling his promises for this day as they had like this bottle be would be hid by a veil &gt;&gt; right are you with me this morning &gt;&gt; I know this is old to some of you but you just bear with me &gt;&gt; we got a bunch of kids need to hear it &gt;&gt; come on this bottle would be a veil and God veiled himself Right? And the unveiling of God. He unveiled himself, see a little bit through Wesley and a little bit through Luther. &gt;&gt; But in our day, &gt;&gt; through the message of a prophet, &gt;&gt; he took the veil off. &gt;&gt; Now we see Christ in plain view. &gt;&gt; Now we see the word as it ought to be and as it was and as he intended for us. Now we can serve him without denomination getting in the way, without creeds getting in the way, without those things getting in the way. We can serve him. Then it's up to us how we apply that. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. But he decreased that the word Christ the Bible what what what he meant to show us would increase in our vision and our view. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Now look. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Now I I know a lot of people they try to decrease the prophet to increase themselves. &gt;&gt; And when you hear that kind of preaching, &gt;&gt; that's a problem. &gt;&gt; He did not decrease to increase my ministry. &gt;&gt; Right. That's right, &gt;&gt; church. &gt;&gt; He decreased to increase Christ. &gt;&gt; The message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. And if I preach Christ and if you preach Christ, if you live Christ, what is it? You proclaiming the same message that he brought to us in the beginning. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; Now, he's fully manifested in this day. Moses was the word in that day because the word was given to him for that day. Joseph was the word in his days portraying Christ. Exactly. Each one of them was the word. And when Jesus came, he was the word in its fullness. Because again, look, Moses part. &gt;&gt; Is this making any sense? &gt;&gt; Moses partially unveiled. &gt;&gt; So the other prophets, he unveiled himself more and more and more. But in Christ, &gt;&gt; right? You can read the name on the bottle &gt;&gt; if you can see that far. &gt;&gt; You could see who he was. Yeah, &gt;&gt; he was the fullness of God manifested. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So what was it now? He said they were only part of the word pointing to it. Notice, keep your thought. Here it comes. He said the whole plan wasn't in them. They were pointing to it. Therefore, after him the fullness. We cannot point back to something else. We don't veil the Bible again and teach denominational doctrine. We preach the message of the hour because Christ has come in plain view to us. &gt;&gt; Yes. So, so here it comes. He said, he said this is this is the complete revelation. How many believe that this he said in the volume of the book that that's what he come in the volume of the book this is the complete revelation. Nothing can be added or taken away from it. There is the complete revelation. All that a shadow of him to come. But when he come he was the perfect Hebrews 1, God in sunundry time spoke to the fathers through the prophet. God spoke through veils the prophet but in this last days through his son Jesus Christ. There you are unveiled out there on Calvary. The son of God unveiled. Listen, brother Brandham didn't come to bring us a new Bible. But what did brother Brandham come to do? The denomination had put a veil over the Bible. The message of the hour come to rip off that veil &gt;&gt; so we could see what the Bible really said. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon, we do have today by God's help the perfect interpretation of the word with divine vindication. I I believe that with all of my heart. Now, we got a foundation laid this morning. We can preach. &gt;&gt; I I don't feel much like a preacher after hearing the preaching this weekend. Last weekend, I went back and listened to that and some of what was said, especially Friday night, Saturday morning, inspired what I have to say today. In his preparation, David had to find a place, &gt;&gt; right? Because if you're going to build a temple, you got to have a lot to build it on. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. So the the temple was built 2 Chronicles 3:1. It was built. He Solomon began to build the house of the Lord at Jerusalem in Mount Mariah where the Lord appeared unto David his father in the place that David had prepared. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite. Now, some of you remember uh Friday night, brother Wendell at the very end. I don't believe it was in his notes. It was just something he was inspired to say, but he was preaching to us and he talked about Ornand the Jebusite who uh he uh who was with David and how they negotiated, remember, over the price of the property. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And David would not take it without paying a price. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, what David goes through to buy that property is very instructive to us because many times we go through trials, we don't understand what's going on. But God's doing something in our lives. &gt;&gt; Remember, David reached a point where he got kind of built up in himself and he numbered the people. &gt;&gt; He counted the people. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now, they weren't supposed to do that. Now, it's not wrong to count people just in general. You don't have to not count. &gt;&gt; But the reason the Israelites were not supposed to count &gt;&gt; is because it wasn't supposed to matter. right? How many soldiers they had, &gt;&gt; right? Because if they started counting how many soldiers they had, they were always going to be in the minority. &gt;&gt; And that'd be instructive for us, too, to understand. We're always going to be in the minority. You say, "Oh, it looks like the message in the it's always going to be." &gt;&gt; Jesus was when he was here. He was one man on the earth. He had 12 disciples and they all run away from him. &gt;&gt; But look what's happened since then. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now look, but but but the message is in the minority. Obviously, we know that that's true. And and and David though, he counted the people. He said, he said, "I'm going to find out how many we have." And God comes up to him. He says, he says, "I'm going to give you a choice of your punishment." He said, "There'd be this happen or I I believe it was your enemy would fall. They'd fall among their enemies." He said, "Or a plague by the hand of the Lord." &gt;&gt; And David said, "I'd rather fall into the hands of a merciful God." &gt;&gt; There's a lot of wisdom in that. &gt;&gt; You know, if I'm going to have trouble in life, I might as well just do what's right. &gt;&gt; Do what the word says. There's going to be trouble anyway. &gt;&gt; I might as well just do what the word says. Fall in the hands of a merciful God. So David took that choice and a great plague fell and many people died because of David numbering the people. Don't make sense to us, but to God it was a great sin. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And so now David, David begins to uh you know begins to plead with God and God stays the hand of the death angel. And when he does, now David goes up to the threshing floor. The angel tells him go and and and make an altar. And David goes up to the threshing floor of Orand to make to buy a place for an altar. And Ornand in 1st Chronicles 21:23, Ornand said it to David, "Take it to thee. Let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes. Lo, I give thee the oxen also for burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meat offering. I give it all." But David had been through some things. &gt;&gt; And David had learned he he'd been through a great a great terrible plague. And he said, "I'm going to make sure that I do everything I can do." &gt;&gt; Right? He said, "I'm not going to take what doesn't cost me anything. I'm not going to offer sacrifices in a place that I didn't do anything to get it there." &gt;&gt; Right? He said, "I you you'd give it to me." It's the same attitude that Abraham had when he was buying the place. Remember Mcpila, the cave of Mpila? He said, "I'm not going to take it from you. I want to pay for it." Because the price had to be paid. There could be no question about who it belonged to. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; And David comes to Orna and he said, the king David said to Orin, "Nay, I will verily buy it for the full price." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Aren't you glad he paid the full price for you? &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad he didn't stop short? &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad he prepared a way for you to come? Sir, &gt;&gt; he said, "For I will not take that which is thine for the Lord, nor offer burnt offerings without cost." &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Brother Wendle dealt with that so eloquently. &gt;&gt; This is the same place, Mount Mariah, that Abraham offered Isaac &gt;&gt; and was provided a ram. &gt;&gt; And I think it teaches us something this morning that if we want to fulfill the will of God, sometimes we have to lay down our own egos. Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; And and the and the idea that we built of how God's going to work in our lives. &gt;&gt; And what he's going to do, &gt;&gt; our ministry that we built in our heads. &gt;&gt; Our church that we built in our heads, our family that we built. Some of you young people, you're going to get married. You think, and you say, "Well, I'm going to marry the prettiest girl, and we're going to have the the wonderful home, and I'm going to have the best job, and we're never going to have any trouble." Do you realize that maybe that's not what God has for you? Maybe maybe there's going to be a little house on a little street and you'll be maybe a seemingly insignificant person, but you got to be able to surrender yourself to the will of God. Cuz sometimes you got to be little before you can be big. The way up is down. &gt;&gt; That's why so many young people get in debt because they want to live the life their parents live and they haven't paid the price. &gt;&gt; Amen. How can you preach that, brother Ben? Because I did it. &gt;&gt; If you want to fulfill the will of God, sometimes you have to pay full price, listen to me this morning, for things you will never use. &gt;&gt; You got to build things for children that aren't yours. &gt;&gt; Pray for people you'll never meet again. &gt;&gt; Come on. Very good. &gt;&gt; Preach to people that can give you nothing in return. &gt;&gt; Hope you're hearing me now. &gt;&gt; Deal with people that maybe have the worst problems and the worst situation and cause you the most trouble &gt;&gt; are you with me now? But you got to be willing to pay full price because you don't know what God's going to do. &gt;&gt; Come on &gt;&gt; with the materials you're gathering. Are you with me this morning? You don't know what God's going to do with these things that you're putting together. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Pay full price for things you will never use so your children have a place to worship. &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about money, church. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about our lives. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's the truth. &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; 1 Chronicles 22:1 said, "David said, "This is the house of the Lord God, and this is the altar of the burnt offering for Israel." David realized that threshing floor, he went through what he went through for a reason. Some of you elders know what I'm talking about. You went through what you went through for a reason. That sickness came for a reason. That pain was there for a reason. And now you bought a place to worship God. Through that pain, through that sickness, through that heartache, through that trial, there's a place there you can worship God. And you give it your all to come to the house of God. And you say, "This is the house of the Lord God." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; This is the altar of the burnt offering for Israel. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And David commanded together the strangers that were in the land of Israel. And he sent masons to he rot stones to build the house of God. And I could just see somebody coming by after they heard the prophets na Nathan's message. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; When Nathan said, "David, you're not to build the temple." &gt;&gt; And somebody comes by the next day and they hear hammering and sawing and what in the world? David, you're not supposed to build the temple. Leave it for the next generation. &gt;&gt; David said, "He never said I couldn't prepare." &gt;&gt; There's a revelation in it, church. &gt;&gt; He never said I couldn't prepare the temple. &gt;&gt; He never said I couldn't buy the materials. &gt;&gt; He never said I couldn't make some nails. &gt;&gt; Now, &gt;&gt; look what he says in verse three. And David prepared iron in abundance &gt;&gt; for the nails, &gt;&gt; for the doors of the gates, for the joinings. David was collecting nails, hinges, &gt;&gt; for gates he would never open. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Doors he would never walk through. &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; We got to expand our vision beyond our own life sometimes. for the joinings for brass in abundance without wait also cedar trees in abundance for the Zidonians and they oft brought much cedarwood &gt;&gt; to David none of that benefited David at all &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; construction can't even begin until he's gone he must decrease &gt;&gt; are you with me now &gt;&gt; he must decrease so that Solomon can increase &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; but look at his attitude I can't build the temple But I can make the nails. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; He didn't pout. He didn't protest. &gt;&gt; He didn't wonder why he got used less than others. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; You realize sometimes the reason we have young people play and do and and work in the church is not because we don't have elders that could do as good a job or better. &gt;&gt; Sometimes the reason we use young people is because somebody's got to train the next generation. &gt;&gt; They got to know how to do it. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. Yes, sir. Because none of us are going to live forever unless we go by way of the rapture. And if we do, none of us going to matter anyway. &gt;&gt; But if we don't, if it'll last for another generation, there'll be a generation ready to worship in the house of God. &gt;&gt; It's time to make some nails. &gt;&gt; Take some brass and gather it up and make some nails. You say, "Well, I'm not a preacher." You can make some nails for the house of God. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? You can start set a an atmosphere. I watch some of our older folks sit stay get in here early and worship the Lord. What does that do? It sets a pattern for our young people that when they see that they realize this is what a Christian does. This is what an elder does in the house of God. I thank you for doing that. What are you doing? Every time you come, you're you're building another nail. &gt;&gt; Making another nail. Putting together another hinge for a door you'll never walk through. or one day maybe after you're gone, a young person will walk through that door into freedom and oh God, walk out of drugs and alcohol and everything else into freedom because you did your part &gt;&gt; in the house of God. &gt;&gt; Very good. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I'm not needed. I'm not wanted. I don't have to be there." Well, that kind of attitude &gt;&gt; doesn't benefit you and it doesn't benefit the next generation either. &gt;&gt; That's right. Jesus knew he had to die. That was his primary purpose. What he came to do &gt;&gt; was to die. &gt;&gt; His body would become would have to die and rot and become soil &gt;&gt; that the church could be planted in. &gt;&gt; Right? He said, "Verily, verily, I say to you, except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die." But the brenam always adds to that and rots. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; it's good. &gt;&gt; It abideth alone, but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit. &gt;&gt; So, it's necessary. And think about it just in the natural. And I'm almost out of time, but think about it just in the natural. It's necessary for us in the natural. Somebody had to go through the hard work &gt;&gt; of inventing things we don't even think about today. Yeah, &gt;&gt; somebody figured out how to use iron. Turn it into weapons of war. Turn it into things. This building is made out of iron. &gt;&gt; Somebody had to figure out how to do that. &gt;&gt; And we don't even think about it. It's so common. &gt;&gt; But somebody had to do it. A generation had to go into the ground. Generations of soldiers &gt;&gt; have watered the fields of of Normandy and the fields of of Okinawa and the fields of the Philippines with their blood. &gt;&gt; The Civil War was fought right here in our country. They watered the field with their blood. &gt;&gt; And out of that the sacrifice of them young men come a nation that we have today &gt;&gt; where we can worship in freedom. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? Something has to die. It's the law of God. Then if that's so L or let me die in such a way that the next generation could be increased. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If it kills me, let me stay in the house of God. Let me worship God. Let me do what God wants done. Let me be what God wants in my life. &gt;&gt; Now is not the time to give up. Now, as you reach the last years of your life, I'm preaching to you elders, but also to our younger people, but as you elders reach the last years of your life, now's not the time to give up and say, "Well, nobody does it right anymore, and nobody No, now's the time to to let your let the things that you do become the bedding ground &gt;&gt; for another generation." Good. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we're afraid to talk about what we've been through. And I don't think we ought to glorify the devil, but sometimes our children need to hear. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Our young people need to hear what God brought us from. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; So that they'll know. &gt;&gt; Some of y'all got testimonies. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; You need to share those. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I'm not don't necessarily mean up here, although that's wonderful to do that, but but share those with our young people. Share those with our with those around you, with your children, with your grandchildren, &gt;&gt; cuz you've been through some things. You've seen some things and you know what God can do. &gt;&gt; You know what you were and you know what you are. There's no shame in that. &gt;&gt; Let God have the glory of it. Now, God Jesus had to die. What did he have to die to? His own will. Just like David, right? David wanted to build the temple. God said, "You won't build the temple. Your son will build the temple." &gt;&gt; And Jesus knew that if he stayed alive, he would be the last one of his kind. &gt;&gt; But if he died on a cross, &gt;&gt; the blood and the water would be separated from him, forming the bride, &gt;&gt; right? And that spirit would come back on the day of Pentecost. And we are the bride part of him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Our sins were judged in his own body there on the tree. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And because of that, what what what happens? He knew he had to die. He wanted to stay there. But he knew he had to die in order to produce a temple of God. &gt;&gt; In order for a temple to be built, in order for a church to come forth, he had to die for a bride to be born. He had to die to his own will. Just like David, just like Abraham. Listen, the Bible said, "Though he were a son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered. And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him, called of God a high priest after the order of Melzdc, he had to die." But the Brandon said, "For only out of death comes life." Did you hear that? Only out of death, lest a corn wheat falls into the ground, it abides alone. If it dies, it produces life. Jesus had to die to produce eternal life. He said, "Now listen closely, Christian friends. Unless you die to yourself and your feelings." &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come on. &gt;&gt; Your feelings act on God's word, you'll never have life. &gt;&gt; Forget your feelings. Just take what God said. How many can do that this morning? Forget your feelings. Take what God said. Plant that seed into that life of your own death, sir. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. and life will be produced out of there and you shall live. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? The seed of God has to grow in the soil of your own death. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Or it'll never grow. &gt;&gt; Good. Very good. &gt;&gt; So Paul said, "I died daily so that the seed of God might produce much fruit." &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Abraham died on that mountain to his own conception. &gt;&gt; Yeah. of how the promise would be fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; David died on that mountain. When the angel said gave him a choice, he let me fall into the hands of a merciful God. &gt;&gt; And Jesus died. &gt;&gt; When he said, "Father, not my will but thine be done." But the Bible said he died more death in Gethsemane than he did on the cross. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He said the Holy Ghost is the way. There's nothing will take its place. No theology, no church, no big buildings, no organizations. Nothing will ever take the place of the blood of Jesus Christ, God's way, the Holy Spirit, being filled with the Holy Ghost. He said the promise is to you if you'll just receive it. God made a preparation. Aren't you glad that he did? David made a preparation. God made a preparation for whosoever will. The conference was held. Decisions was made. He said, "Men all down through the age has stumbled at that." So simple. I I've listened to that. I listen to that testimony again. I stumbled across it the other day. Brother Brandham was dealing with an elderly woman and and they they they taped the testimony. I'm glad that they did cuz brother Brandon's trying to tell her she's a Christian and she refuses to believe it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; She just has a difficult time with that. Brother Brandham just keeps telling her, "I I know your life. I'm your pastor. I'm your shepherd. &gt;&gt; And God hasn't shown me anything that's wrong. You're a Christian. Just the devil trying to trouble you." &gt;&gt; Right? And so many times we what we do is we we think there's got to be more to it. &gt;&gt; So we just we frustrate the grace of God because we're always and you can hear the word of God says by his blood you're clean. By his blood you're forgiven. By his blood you've been made clean and whole. All you got to do is believe it and accept it and rejoice in it. And we want there to be something more to it. And and so we all you got to do is die to yourself. &gt;&gt; And sometimes that means just simply accepting what he's done. You can't cover yourself. Take God's covering. You can't learn how to do it. There's no learning about it. God does it himself. It's supernatural through life. God does the covering. He said, "You can't do it." &gt;&gt; He said, "Not as much as you try to do it. You can no more clean yourself from sin by joining churches and taking creeds." &gt;&gt; Listen to me, young people. Then a leopard could lick his own spots off. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Could you imagine that, Melody? If a leopard with his spots I'm not going to say anything else for a minute that's worth writing down. If a leopard could take his his tongue and lick his own spots off, &gt;&gt; he can't do it, can he? &gt;&gt; Does it sound silly? That's what it's like when we try to save ourselves. &gt;&gt; When we try to just be good enough to be saved, &gt;&gt; say it's like a leopard trying to lick his own spots off. &gt;&gt; You can't do it. Jesus said, "Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit to his stature?" You can't add an inch to your height. right? &gt;&gt; Or take an inch away. &gt;&gt; Oh my. But God made you what you are and he's given you his spirit. You've got, he said, you've got to die to yourself, your own thoughts. Give up and let the Holy Spirit cover you with his presence &gt;&gt; and his power. That's God's decision. &gt;&gt; See, sometimes you have to die to today so tomorrow can come into existence. &gt;&gt; Very good. &gt;&gt; They say in finance they I think it's Dave Ramsey that says it. said, "You got to live like no one else so tomorrow you can live like no one else." &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; You got to die to yourself today &gt;&gt; for the future. I know that's difficult to do, &gt;&gt; but but our young people, it's very hard for them to do that, especially if they don't see us doing it. &gt;&gt; Give up and let the Holy Spirit cover you with his presence and his power. That's God's decision. See, the Greeks come when Jesus was alive and they told they they come to the disciples. They said sers we would see Jesus. Brother Brandon preaches a sermon on that many times he preached that and and Jesus that's when he said except a corn wheat fall and die it abides alone. And here what was it? He had to have a gentile body a house to dwell in but he had to die for that house to be built. But remember today we try to find him in everything. We try to find him in a church building. We try to find him in a denomination. We try to find him in saying some creed. We try to find him by keeping certain days, by obeying certain rituals. Oh, come on, church. We don't find him in legalism. We cannot find till we come to Calvary. There we are crucified, fallen into the dust of the earth, died to ourselves, then reborn again, then we find Jesus. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Oh, so many try today to hold their self and maintain their own idea. If you have got my way of it, I believe this. But you cannot find Christ until you die to yourself and accept him, the word, then you find life. there would be a gentile church. They said, "Sir, we see Jesus." They were Gentiles. And he said, "There will be a gentile church, but first I've got to die." &gt;&gt; Very good. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham talked about a a converted gun that he had. You remember the Weatherbe Magnum or the gun he hadn't made like a Weatherbe Magnum, boarded out &gt;&gt; and had it fixed so it shoot like a Weatherbe Magnum because he didn't want to spend the money on the real thing. &gt;&gt; He didn't want to pay the price for it. So they they made him one like a Weatherbe magnum and it blew up in his face. Remember? Almost killed him. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon said, "I learned a lesson there." Yes, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; You're becoming a Christian or want to be a Christian. Just don't fool around with this here handshaking stuff. This here overnight conversion. It'll blow up somewhere along down the road. &gt;&gt; He said, "If that had been a Weatherbe Magnum, begin a Weatherbe Magnum, brought out a Weatherbe Magnum, it would have been all right. It would have been made for the shell. But when you're trying to put a big shell that goes in another gun in something that ain't able to stand it. That's why it don't work when you try to be something that you're not &gt;&gt; right. But he said if you want to be a Christian, you be born again. Die to yourself. Start from the bottom and come forth. He said there won't be no blowups along the road. You'll be able to hold the charge the Holy Ghost puts in you. That's right. If you don't, you'll never be able to stand it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I want to say this in closing. We'll pick it up tonight. David would never wash his hands in the brazen sea. He would never walk on floors overlaid with pure gold. &gt;&gt; The floors were overlaid with pure gold. You think God don't like nice things? He does. &gt;&gt; But what he loves even more than that is a repentant heart. But they overlaid the the floor with gold, the walls with gold. When you walk into the temple, you they made reproductions of it, made it to the specification. You can see it. It was gold all the way around as you come into the Holy of Holies. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Cedar overlaid with gold, with ivory, even the the nails of shiny brass. Listen, David would never walk on those floors. He would never stand at the dedication and offer prayer. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; He He didn't see the smoke fill the temple. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Some of y'all ought to be grateful God's let you live long enough to see this day. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; See what God's doing among his people right now &gt;&gt; cuz you were a part of it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But there will be things happen after you're gone that the Lord carries that you never saw the results of, but you were part of it. Come on. &gt;&gt; You take that. Let the de when the devil tries to beat you up and say you're worthless and you don't do no good to the body of Christ. You I was a part of that. I stood through the hard times. I was there during that. I knew what what it was like to to when it was difficult. And now I've seen God begin to do miracles and things begin to happen. What is it? You you made some nails. &gt;&gt; You brought in some stones. &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You wrote some songs. Good. &gt;&gt; David would never stand there. &gt;&gt; Solomon stood there and the doorpost of the temple moved at the dedication of the temple, but David was gone. God wouldn't let him stand there. &gt;&gt; Wasn't his part. &gt;&gt; But all the nails and the hinges. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, I don't need notoriety. Come on, church. I don't want I don't I don't need my name to go down and say, "Well, he helped the message of the air." We've had brothers like that that they helped the message so much and think of some that have gone on, but they Perry Green, but they had older now and and can't preach anymore and and it's but I thank God for his contribution to the message. But I don't I don't need my name to go down as somebody who contributed greatly to the message. But let me make a nail. Let me let me forge a hinge. &gt;&gt; That's enough. I just want to be a part of what God's doing in our hour. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Never would stand and see it. Brother Brandham didn't live to see the bride we have today. &gt;&gt; You look at the meeting that we had. You know, realize brother Brandham never got to go to meetings like that. &gt;&gt; He had his own meetings. &gt;&gt; They were filled with all kinds of people. &gt;&gt; There were no message people. &gt;&gt; Now we can gather together and think about the the benefit of that. people full of the Holy Ghost and worship. Brother B never got to see it. &gt;&gt; But every nail &gt;&gt; he made a way &gt;&gt; that the Lord could suddenly come to his temple. &gt;&gt; David made the nails in the doors. And when they began to sing, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Every song that they sang was one David wrote. He was writing songs for the future. Sometimes you, you know, sometimes David wrote out of what was going on in his life right then. Sometimes you you're going through life and maybe you're writing songs, so to speak. You're going through some things. You're writing songs of woe and despair. David did that at times, but sometimes he wrote songs to be sung in a temple that he would never stand in. But he still wrote them anyway. He still put in the work so they would have something to sing. Listen, you got a part today for a future generation if there is one. There's something for you to do. I say let's get up and be doing it. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; We're making preparation for something as the musicians come. Either we'll go by rapture or by the grave. There is no third option. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? We'll either go by rapture or go by way of the grave. But no matter how we go, let's tie it to ourselves first. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we can leave behind a big pile of nails. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. said, "My children, maybe my grandchildren, they could use these." [Music] &gt;&gt; But Harvey, your dad's not here today, but he left behind a pile of nails. He went to church. And when Harvey Senior passed away, Brother Harvey testified at Sorry, Brother Harvey, but he testified at the funeral and said, said, "My dad went to church, took his family to church, and it made a difference in Brother Harvey's generation." And Brother Harvey that has done things here in the church, working when he didn't feel like it, doing things. Some of these el brother Danny's we talked about brother Danny the other day but Andrew and it was I couldn't have said it better and these brothers have done something and they're not old but but they're older than we are some of us younger ones they they they've made a piles of nails some of you are the result the white camp family Hoffman family the result of some some nails that were made by people in in past generations ations people that lived years ago. You You're the result of somebody who went I think of brother Don Osborne. I know Sister Phyllis listens to some of our services. Brother Dawn, you know, he was a man who he was different. He he had a different motive and things in his preaching and things. He he was just evangelistic, purely evangelistic. But there's people sitting here today that are part of our church that were a result of the dawn going and showing a video or doing something. They showed it to somebody. Somebody else showed it to somebody else. They showed it to somebody else. And eventually it got down to my generation. And we're putting together a building &gt;&gt; made with nails &gt;&gt; from a previous generation. And thank you for making those nails. But if there's another generation, let's keep making them. Let's keep making some hinges. Let's do for our children what was done for us. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; If we can, let's do better. Let's build more. Let's dig deeper. See, we don't just do these things for ourselves. We don't make those hard choices just for ourselves, but we do it for others. I thank you for doing that, and I thank you for being patient this morning. Would you bow your heads together? I was so stirred Wednesday night or Friday night rather when brother brother uh Wendle preached. [Music] So stirred by that message cuz brother Windle's done made some hard choices and worked very difficult. I'll say this because he's not here. He's done some some very difficult things. toiled in an area that's very poor. Preached in a place where he doesn't get a lot of a lot of gratitude I think for for what he does and what he is as a preacher. But he did the hard work so his sons and those coming on his brothers and different ones could go out and be a help to the message of the hour. He helped me other brothers coming. Then brother Daryl Ward that was here. He he made some nails. I was talking to him this week and I reminded him of some things that he had done when when he was when he was younger and I was much younger and we were sitting there at Bransville. We were doing we were working. We were putting in some work there at Bransville and not knowing what we were doing but we're preparing something and we're putting in some work and brother Daryl was willing to come and preach for us and to people maybe just a few people there but he was willing to come and I thanked him for that this week. I said, "Brother Daryl, you don't know what you did. Listen church, I want to be that kind of person. I want to help somebody else. Lord, help me not to go through life and end up it all bit was about me and and what I wanted and what I got done. Why don't you just leave that old moly grub pit and leave that old pit of self-pity and and come on out and do something for God and make some nails. Get some hinges ready and get ready for a rapture. Listen, if you go by way of the grave, you say, "Well, I might die soon." If you go by way of the grave, listen, there will be there will be a pe you'll be there first. You get to go first. The dead in Christ will rise first, and we which are alive and remain will be caught up together with them to meet our Lord in the air. You're going to see me on tomorrow morning. Amen. Hallelujah. Don't give up now. Leave behind a big pile of nails so somebody else can put it together. Heavenly Father, oh Lord Jesus, may we continue to build Lord in our lives, in our preaching, in everything that we do, not to tear down, but to edify. I pray you'd grant it, Lord God. Lord, I pray that that would be the Lord, the the the focus of this church, Lord. And I I thank you for what you've done through this body of believers. So, we're not huge, but Lord, we we've got people that are willing to put their hands to the to the shovel.
