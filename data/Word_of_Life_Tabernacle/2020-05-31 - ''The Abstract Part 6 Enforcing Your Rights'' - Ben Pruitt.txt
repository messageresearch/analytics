father I pray that your spirit would be real in this place today and Lord may we come down to the word Lord where we cope with the word of God this morning Lord we don't want to just be someone that sympathizes with it or agrees that it's true or we want to live the word we want to cope with it we want to these things that we've been preaching to be more than just an abstract theory but Lord may it be a reality in our lives Lord that if there's anything that would not be right and anything that would be insufficient in our lives our on where we would not deal with things like we should I pray that you take it out Lord it just moving the service this morning I pray for every one Lord that is in need father I think of different ones that are sick Lord and some that are gone I pray that you just move Lord and just give them strength and the ability to do what they need to do we ask it in Jesus name amen amen god bless you turn with me if you would to the scriptures this morning we're going to read from Leviticus chapter 25 and verse 23 it's good to see everyone in the house of the Lord we'll just read that one verse Leviticus 25 23 so I'll give you a second to turn there it's always good to be in the house of the Lord and this week I've been troubled as many of you have been by the things that are going on in this country we see problems situations on every hand and you look at something that happens and there's always an overreaction to that and an overreaction to that and and it just seems like it's spiraling out of control and but you know we have to remember that we're pilgrims here we don't belong here the reason why we feel like we don't there's so much going on it seems like it's out of control but we're not from here and so we don't get caught up in that and brother Branham taught us that it's it's demons fighting with each other so what it is the Satan is the Prince of the power of the air and these demons actually fight with one another and me does people are under the influence of that and they don't even realize what they're doing but we're under the influence of a different spirit and so we can during these times but pray for your country remember to love one another and we caught up in the culture but remember that we're here for another purpose we're going home we're not gonna stay here this isn't our long-term home you know when people complain about the injustice and the things that have gone on and I'm sure there is injustice there always will be in any government of this earth remember we can invite them to a place where there's no injustice come with me and we we know a place we know a city that we're going to where there's no problems no no we don't have to enforce any kind of racial harmony because ever all one and so that's the place that we're going to and so we're thankful for that today Leviticus 25 23 the land shall not be sold forever the land is mine for your strangers and sojourners with me your strangers it's a good thing to remember and sojourners with me I pray the Lord would add his blessing to the word you may be seated we've been talking about the abstract and this morning I want to speak to you about enforcing your rights we realize that the abstract has come and for many of us that are sealed by the Holy Ghost were sealed to the day of our redemption and yet we've struggled many times with enforcing the rights that we have and the children of Israel had the same problem their land which correlates to the promises of the New Testament the land the physical land of the Old Testament could not be sold forever and yet it was rare that they actually lived on it and was able to benefit from the land if you look down to the Old Testament it was it was rare the times that they could actually live on and enjoy it the way that they were supposed to but they actually constantly were going into sin and and go being under this country under that country and losing the land and so you find that the idea of redemption the idea the land can't be sold forever very rarely came into effect but really under the law the land could not be sold it could only be used for 49 years so the value of the land to a purchaser at any time would never be as high as the value to the one who owned it to the family who owned that land that Joshua had given that land and so the highest point was only the use of it for 49 years and then there would have to come a day of Jubilee and there would come a day because he said the land is not yours it's mine and we have to recognize that that's the case when it comes to our promises that the promises are yen a man in Christ they belong to God and so he's not going to back up on his promises his promises are always going to be true no matter what we do in the meantime but we have to learn to enforce our rights to those promises so there in theory every man could live in peace on land that had always been in his family and the scripture speaks of a concept of each man being under his vine and under his fig tree and we find that in first Kings 425 that it was a saying that that they used and it said in Judah and Israel dwelt safely every man under his vine and under his fig tree from and even to BIR Sheba all the days of Solomon now this was Israel's Golden Age it was Israel's time that they could live together and that they would be able to actually enforce the rights to their property it was the time when things worked like they should and the reason is because title to land is only as good as your willingness and ability to enforce it and what we found that in this country the reason why title is considered good is because we have good government we do and it don't seem like it but we have good government and what that means is we're under a system of government where you can enforce your rights so I can go up to the courthouse and Ike if someone is living on my property I can enforce my right to it under the law I have a right to it I can enforce that right under Solomon the people could go and enforce the rights that they have now there's always going to be a contest for the land and I want us to understand today that no matter how sealed you are and how how how much you're Christian you're always going to have a contest there's always going to be somebody an adversary that's going to be there and gonna say I want that and he's going to try to take away your Joy's going take away your piece he's gonna try to take away your healing he's even gonna try to cause you to commit sin he's always gonna be there he's always there but remember when he's there you have an officer the Holy Ghost that can go in and enforce the rights to your land now under Solomon under that administration the people had a good king all they had to do was ask the king and rights would be enforced all they had to do was was petition the king under other administration's even though they were Israelite administration's rights were not so easily enforced in Micah chapter 2 and verse 1 the prophet Mike is speaking to those who would take advantage of the people not being able to enforce the rights he said woe to them that devise iniquity work evil upon their beds when the morning is light they practice it listen because it is in the power of their hand listen to me this morning it's the biggest indication of a lack of integrity and character in your life is what happens when you have the power to do something whether you do it or not and that goes to how we raise our children how we treat our spouses it goes to how we treat one another at church because just because you have the ability to do something if you do it and that's where someone with it with a uniform on for you put it that way has a great responsibility right because they have to they have to enforce the laws but they have the power to take someone's life we give them a gun and a badge because they have the power to do that but that takes character and the problem that we have today is not a it's not so much that there's people say what a systemic it's not so much that the laws are the same most of them as they were but the problem is to people because you've got men without character women without character people without character so something will happen they take advantage of the situation so characters what you do and you think there are no consequences and the prophet Micah cries out against that he said it's in the power of their hand to do it and so they do it he says and they covet fields and take them by violence houses and take them away so they oppress a man in this house even a man and his heritage and then you find that under some administration's there was such wickedness in the land that the king who would be the protector of the people's rights for the j.t actually himself became the one who coveted the people's lands and here in the story of Ahab in a Boston you can go read it I won't read the whole thing to save time but in first Kings 21 3 it says they've all said they have the Lord forbid at me but I should give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee so he comes and offers to buy it from him and they bought understanding this belongs to me I'm not going to give it up Eastside and many times before Satan will begin to fight you on something he'll actually try to get it get you to give it to him and most of the time we don't give him as big a fight as we should but I think we ought to stand up like neighbor said the Lord forbid it to me that I should give up what is mine I should give up what is the inheritance of my father's God promised me I could have deliverance God promised me I could I could work these fields out I was given a promise my father handed down to me and a distractor said this belongs to you healing belongs to you salvation belongs to you a holiness belongs to you all these things belong to me so I have a right to enforce those things so he says god forbid that I should give the inheritance of my father's unto thee we're too quick to let the devil steal from us take it from us because we think well where there's no way but look we end up having the attitude that the man did when he said well my Master's a hard man I'll just bury his talent in the dirt I won't do anything with it so I'll have it when he comes back no no you've got to you've got to be a good steward as we spoke of Wednesday night to be faithful to the things that God has given you because it's the inheritance of your father's and you live under the administration the kind of administration like Solomon so that you are able to enforce your rights in the land now Jezebel got wind of what Ahab was doing you remember Ahab went back to his house and got real sad wouldn't eat and Jezebel went after him and of course Jezebel being who she was she's got no conscience and she comes through she says well I'll take care of it for you and so they have weights you know and Jezebel starts writing letters and signing Ahab's name to him and invite invite him to a feast get him falsely accused of something of blasphemy and then he ends up being killed and in 1st Kings 21 16 it came to pass when they have heard that Namath was dead that Ahab grows up to go down to the vineyard if they bought the jezreelite to take possession of it and the word of the lord came to elijah the tishbite saying arise go down to meet a hab king of Israel which is in Samaria behold he is in the vineyard of naboth whether he's gone down to possess it so he's gone down this this ungodly King has gone down into the land to take possession of what was God's people's what was one of God's sons he goes down into the land and God sends a prophet brother Bill to meet him there and to declare the land does evolve to you the land doesn't murong in a denominational system the land doesn't belong under treats and dogmas but the land he said belongs to neighbor to the family of God to the person it was given to he said he's going down to possess it national speaking to him saying thus saith the LORD hath so killed and also taken possession and also speaking to him saying thus saith the Lord in the place where dogs licked the blood of nabe off show dogs lick thy blood even thine and this is why this prophecy was made now look as Christians we have rights to every promise made in the scripture that's our land let's go to Galatians chapter 3 I want to put this as I've said before Paul puts this sometimes in a way that is better than I could put it and so we're looking to the Word of God and just see how Paul puts this about the promises of God in Galatians 3:15 said brethren I speak after the manner of men though it be but a man's covenant and if it be confirmed if there's a seal on it if the parties have agreed to it we would say today if you've gone and recorded at this courthouse it's done no man dis Anolis or at us there too and what this means is you can't unilaterally change the contract and this is true of beats when someone gives you a deed to land they can't go back and say oops I messed up I gave you too much I'll just sign another deed and take it away people try to do that but it's not legal they can't just do that they have to get you to agree to it because the land passed from their hands into yours right and so the covenant was made between two parties and so the contract was finished unless there was consent by both parties now so he said even a covenant of man is that way once it's confirmed nobody goes and changes it nobody says well just don't matter anymore because both parties had to agree to that verse 16 says down to Abraham and his seed were the promises made he saith not and to seeds as of many but as of one and to thy seed which is Christ and this I say that the covenant that was confirmed before of God in Christ the law which was four hundred and thirty years after cannot dissing all so he's saying God made a promise to Abraham and the law couldn't come later I love the word of God he couldn't come later and change the terms of the contract and so Paul was making the argument that is by faith because it was my faith in the beginning it was by faith to Abraham so if Abraham was able to get a hold of the promises of God by faith then we are able to get a hold of the promises of God by faith he's saying the law could not change that covenant right now he said the law which was 430 years after cannot dissin all that it should make the promise of none effect for if the inheritance be of the law it is no more promise but God gave it to Abraham by promise see you can't take the deed you can't take the promise that was given to Abraham and then say ok I gave it to you but I'm gonna change it I'm gonna add a law to it I'm gonna add these works that you've got to do no it's my faith right we're justified by faith and so he says God gave it to Abraham he said by promise wherefore then serveth law it was added because of transgressions till the seed should come to whom the promise was made so he makes the argument that the promise was made there but it was made to Abraham's seed singular which is Christ so he says the seed should come to whom the promise was made it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator so this law was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator and he says now a mediator is not a mediator of one but God is one so God brought the law down to Moses and dealt with the people through Moses but it did not change the original covenant now look the promise to Abraham was not between two parties now that that verse 20 if you'll back up to that Galatians 3:28 he said now a mediator is not a mediator of one this is a hard verse for many people to understand he said but God is one but what he's saying is that if there's a mediator if you have Moses if you have Moses then there's two parties he says but God is one what God made a promise by himself he swore and he made an unconditional promise so when God spoke to Abraham he didn't say I will if you will he said I will he made the promise to him and he said I will do this now he thought God is one that he it was only him so he is the only one that could make the promise and he is the one who enforces it now it was not between two parties it was all gone so verse 21 he said it's the law then against the promises of God god forbid for if there had been a law given which could have given life verily righteousness should have been by the law but the scripture hath concluded all under sin that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe to them that believe and that's us he said but before faith came we were kept under the law shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ that we might be justified by faith but after that faith has come we are no longer under schoolmaster you're all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus he says for as many of us have been baptized into Christ to put on Christ there is neither Jew nor Greek there is neither bond nor free there is neither male nor female you're all one in Christ Jesus that's the promise that's in our inheritance and and so we realized even though in the flesh we're under men and women are under different covenants but not according to the promise and we're going back to a place where there's neither male nor female neither bond nor free and in Christ now there's neither bond nor free neither male nor female are you with me now you're just as much a child of God as someone who's free if you're bound just much a child of God a male or a female you're all one in Christ Jesus we can say it this way a black man a white man a Chinese or anything else whatever color of your skin whatever your past has been whatever whatever you are whatever you've done if you believe if you can believe if you can come to God and you can accept God at his terms and you receive the Holy Ghost and what happens that makes you a partaker of the promises of God just as much as anybody else now he said for the promise now what what promise was this Acts 239 he said if if you be Christ in you're Abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise and that promise the next 239 he said the promise is unto you now that's pretty pretty straightforward isn't it the promise is unto you what is the promise to be an heir how do we become an heir we become an error we were always God's children we don't become sons but we take our inheritance when we receive the abstract then we can take advantage of it you were a son but it didn't do you a whole lot of good you lived in sin you did what sinners do but now you can take advantage of what's already yours you with me now you can take advantage through the process of the death of Christ a burial resurrection and now the return of the abstract the promise is unto you and to your children to all that are afar off even as many as the Lord our God shall call aren't you glad he's still calling aren't you glad he's still working I would hate to be and eyed people sometimes we we get in the weeds and we forget the big picture and the big picture is we need mercy the big picture is we still need the death of Christ on a cross and someone say that they didn't want to hear what happened 2,000 years ago well that is what matters most in your life is what happened 2,000 years ago and that doesn't change but you got to take advantage of it today but now the promise is unto you to your children to all that are afar off even as many as the Lord our God shall corner brother Brown says the Holy Ghost is our witness here's the proof here's the proof he is the field and so we need him we need that in our lives we need to have we need to receive the Holy Spirit because if we do not we don't have a seal if we do not we don't have proof is our proof now it won't prove to anybody else but it fruits to you right now you you could live because you could live the Holy Ghost could work through you and listen to you look at the example about the random brother branham God could heal people and everything else in his ministry and the Holy Ghost worked through him and you couldn't put a finger on his life and at the same time people called him a devil still the Holy Ghost wasn't approved to them as I've said before the cloud coming in and showing the face of Christ it's not proof to the unbeliever the unbelievers just they're just an unbeliever we're gonna say well something happen something happened and just made it that way but but we're believers so to us it is a proof and so we could say like they did when Jesus rose from the dead it has been many infallible proofs of his resurrection he's appeared to us but only to believers to those that would believe now we could say he said he is the bonafide rikes i watch that he is the ooph I'd rights what that means is modified means it's been proved to be true right he's my oh my he was proved to be a son of God he was proved to be able to live in a world without sin he was proved to be race risen again on the third day he proved that the word was true he proved that all the David rode and all that Moses wrote and everything else was true listen to me and when the Holy Spirit comes down on us it is proof to us in our life that that same word is true why because it's his spirit now he said he is the bonafide rights he is the abstract need to every word God spoke hey Ben he is the abstract need to every word God spoke he is a witness that Christ lifts because he lives we live also is the bonafide statement now we would take a statement today and if you were going to record a legal document they require you to take it before a notary public and the notary public says before me personally appeared John Doe and I know this is him and he signed his name so he's saying the Holy Ghost is our proof our seal our notary if you put it that way our acknowledgement that what we're saying is true that what we believe about a rapture is true what we believe about the second coming of Christ is true what we believe about the message of the hour is true the Holy Ghost is our proof now let's look at some things that the Holy Ghost proves in Isaiah chapter 53 and verse 5 says but he was wounded for our transgressions so we still believe this today he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him with His stripes we are healed knowledge that this is true but the holy ghost proves it are you with me now we acknowledge that it's true I can say it's true I can say it looks like it's real I can say I have from the evidence that it looks like it's real but when the Holy Ghost comes then it makes it real now brotherbrother said well anything that Saints put upon you in the way of sickness or whatever it is he said every born-again person has an abstract warrant as a warrant from God and the Holy Spirit is here to put any devil out the Holy Spirit is here to put any devil out no matter if he is cancer tumor cataract whatever he is hey bad the Holy Spirit will put him out if you'll serve notice on him in the name of Jesus Christ because he has no legal rights he said I'm the Lord that healeth all thy diseases is that right he was wounded for our transgressions with His stripes we were healed but you've got to go over and take it well said if you went to your home tonight he said you legitimate people and I I guess that means those of you who have a home and owned it and it's yours belongs to you you legitimate people he said there's a bunch of drunks in there kicking around carrying around smoking drinking cursing living in morally you'd say hey get out of here this is my house this is my house he'd say I'm a human being this was built for human beings I got it right here you'd say this is my house you know I got a living room we got some furniture and I long ago they had the couch and the loveseat and there's five there's five late or recliners in there and just kind of the way they make them anymore and so I got you know but I don't want a stranger on any one of them just because I got five recliners in my living room doesn't mean I look like a guy that would have five recliners in my living room don't I but just because I've got that doesn't mean that I want a stranger in any one of them then we got an offense in our house I think we got one more bed than we do people but I don't want a stranger in it I got enough food that for some people but I don't want a stranger in my house some of y'all come over that's fine but I don't want no strangers and I don't want nobody showing up unexpectedly no but you know how it is if if you come in even if it's me now you love me but if you come home and found me in your house you'd wonder how I got there what I'm doing there right and maybe there would be a legitimate reason but I'd have to explain myself that's right because it's your property it belongs to you you'd say he'd say I'm a human being this was built for human means I got a right here you'd say this is my house I have an abstract need that proves this is my property and then if you show him the deed and he will not move then there is a law down here that will make him move he said in a fat devil the come to you and I tried to send you to a premature grave tried to you up read God's abstract deed by His stripes we were healed he said if he don't want to believe that there's a Holy Ghost here the law of God that'll kick him out our rights have to be enforced if we never show up to enforce our rights and sometimes we just got to come God's provided way let our rights be enforced sometimes you've got to comment to the house of God when you don't feel like it and and sometimes you feel like you shouldn't come but but you come anyway because you know you want to enforce your rights because what happens and what maybe we'll get into this more later but what happens is the more you don't enforce those rights more he comes in and I've watched it over the years the more you give in and say well it's just too hard the more he will come and test you in that same area over and he'll keep testing you there until you build a defense against it he won't leave you alone it'll keep after you in that same air you don't think you say well I made a mistake but if you've struggled with that he's gonna keep coming at your weakness he's a ravening line looking to see whom he can devour and you find a lion will go after the weakest part of the body or the weakest part of the herd and he'll watch for him and he'll watch for him anyway and he's very patient because he won't fight the whole hurt he'd lose so he goes after a straggler he goes after someone with a weakness he watches for a he watches for one that's been hurt so church many times it's when we get this when we get hurt we think well I'll just back away from church I'll just backwards now so god no that's the time when we need to be right in the middle of the herd that's the time when we need to be right among those people and say Lord I'm gonna enforce my rights today well the brown said just ring up Jesus central Jes us now he said find out if something don't take place and you know we don't understand that I realized a few weeks ago that my kids don't ever have to spell anything on a phone you'd have a phone number be 1-800 abstract or whatever that it would be and you'd take those numbers you have to learn how to spell it on the phone my kids don't have to do that it just doesn't seem to be a thing anymore but back in the day you'd have to ring up central jesus j esus now the numbers find out if something don't take place the angels of God will take their positions and that devil will get out he said you can stand there on your toes and say yes sir it's the truth these not appear down here you've read your title clear you know what it is he said let the devil say oh don't you do it don't you do it he said that's that old nasty porter at the door that's not one of these brothers that greets you here at the church but you see he's at the doors your own home he says there's they don't do it don't do it don't no come in don't you don't you don't have a right to your healing don't don't go to church today don't believe God today don't read your Bible we'll see that nasty porter at the door he said don't you believe in that that's supporter what walk right on in though it's yours you got a pass you got an abstract need on the place if sickness dwells in there you got an abstract deed he says again if you went home tonight what if there's an enemy sitting in your house and the enemy said now wait a minute this house is built for human beings it's mined just as much as it is yours I'm as much human as you are he said you walked right down to the courts get your abstract deed show him this is my property it belongs to me well he said yes but I'm as much human as you are if he won't listen you can go get the law and the law will throw him out and what happens is we get to use to the dark there's a old song says I don't want to get adjusted to this world I don't want to get adjusted we get used to things just being that way with that's just the way humans are well I'm a human I've got a right here we might say maybe there's something that runs in our family and say well we has a right to be there because buddy was that way my daddy or my mama he was that way with them and so he's got a right to be there no he has no right because your lineage your heritage shouldn't come from them the title deed to the promises of God didn't come from her mother and father it comes from God so he said you walk right now to the course get your abstract needs showing this is my property belongs to me when he said yes but I was much human as you are if he won't listen you can go get the law and the law will throw him out when you surf warning on the devil that he's got his nasty self on God's property I love the way put that the stir DS got his nasty self camped on God's property you got to call it what it is his nasty self kept on God's property and he says if he don't want to get out just call on the authorities of heaven God's law agent the Holy Ghost he will throw him out yes sir it's your property every divine promise in the Bible belongs to every Christian don't let the devil talk to you and tell you up that's for preachers let the devil talk to you and say well that was for a profit every divine promise of God belongs to every Christian the devil come and talk to you and say well I could live like that but it just runs in my family I'm different no you can live for God you don't have to do drugs you don't have to drink just because your family drinks just because people around you do drugs just because everybody else does that don't mean you have to I've talked to young people about this before just because I serve God as a young person I I'm here to tell you today just because other young people leave doesn't mean you have to leave you can continue living forgotten you can keep yourself from the things of the world you can stay away from those things you don't have to go that way don't let the devil sit there and tell you because of who you are because you see the weaknesses in your flesh he's not looking at your flesh he's not looking at what you can do he's looking at the promise you have an abstract a right to all the promises of God every Christian has every divine promise in the Bible belongs to every Christian so brother banner says what are you scared about are you afraid to take his word for anything what's getting down where we live now in are you scared to take his word for anything for anything what did God show us that he even cared about a little fish about a mother opossum even cared about those things why because a prophet cared about it so God cared about it and there's things in your life you care about but you think was just too insignificant it's too little no every thing that you have need of are you afraid to take his word for anything don't be afraid call the thing right I am an heir to this he said oh I know I don't deserve it but I'm an heir anyhow maybe you messed up you've had problems in your life and all of us have at some point you got a right to joy again I love the way David prays he said get restore unto me the joy of thy salvation I've got a right to joy you may have been through it but you got a right to joy you got a right to peace you got a right you're not going on what you been you're going on what you are today a son or daughter of God enforcing your rights to the promises of God you don't have to remain like that you have a right no he said I know I don't deserve it but I'm an heir anyhow because I'm an heir I receive it that's it there you are because I'm an heir he said we're heir of salvation heir of the Holy Spirit I'm an heir because jesus paid the price nothing I had to do I just fell heir to it he said I'm healed because I'm an heir to it I know I'm reading a lot but some of these things I just I just put it down without the Lord you know this is something that will feed our souls something that'll do it's good he said err salvation purchase of God washing his spirit cleanse in his blood he said I'm an heir to it my diseases are gone my affliction is gone I know it's hard to keep up with me sometimes I'm reading the end of these quotes in the beginning but he says that's our story hey man that's our story blessed assurance Jesus is mine oh what a foretaste of glory divine error salvation purchase of God born of his spirit washed in his blood this is my story this is not just a preacher story it's not just people who have money not just people who knew a certain thing or have been in the message for so long but this is my story this is my song praising my Savior all the day long amen amen what is it it's I'm here I ever write to the promises of God I don't have to back up for any devil that comes by my way I don't have to let the news destroy my peace in God I don't have to let circumstances destroy Who I am in Christ I don't have to let the world come down on me and oppress me to the point where I'm sick and I'm tired and I'm weary and all the time I'm just sure you'll get down someday I'm sure you'll be sick sure you'll be weary but you have a way out of that you don't have to let that be the story of your life and the woman that wrote blessed assurance was blind she said this is my story very bad oh brother brother said didn't Satan can't stand that because he said defeated being he's nothing but a bluff Jesus paid the price hallelujah called us by His grace we're a tear he said what a perfect setup that is see he's already defeated I never defeated him Christ defeated him I'm just claiming my own god-given privileges that's all you do you just still Satan get away from here I've got an abstract deed on this building it's mine I earned it it belongs to me Oh Church if we can just recognize today that we it belongs to us people say it's too hard it's too difficult you shouldn't do that but it belongs to me everybody said there's Giants in the land everybody said there's there's problems with the land we're never going to be able to take it the Giants are 2 million they're too big and Caleb said the land is ours the land belongs to us how can we not take what belongs to us the question is not can we take it how can we not take it so you have a right and the Holy Spirit enforces the right to healing he proves the right to healing we have a right to to live and if I could put it this way you have a right to financial health you have a right to live as a child of God in the blessings of God even in your material life and we don't preach health wealth and prosperity because I know there's times where poor people that'll be poor all their lives and be just as much a Christian as you are but yet you can all things for yours and brother branham explains that him but first of all read Matthew five and five is a blessing of the meek for they shall inherit the earth that's a promise brother Brent said Abraham could lay hold on him yet poor his cattle was starving law took the best ground his water was short hot days and the herdsmen have been in trouble everything looked like going wrong for Abraham yeah you own the whole thing and Abraham was rich compared to some you know wealth is relative very much so some of the wealthiest people I know complain all the time but they go through things - the more money you have the more money you spend generally and so a lot of times we're asking God for the wrong things we're asking for wealth we ought to be asking him for peace asking him for some of the people that if I was going to Envy someone and that that's not the Christian thing to do but if I was gonna end me someone it would be someone who has their debts paid and and just lived simply before God and just able to be a real Christian and do what they need to do it and somebody like that that that's worth more it's worth more than having all of the world's things and so brother Brown said this water was short hot days the herdsmen have been in trouble everything look like gone wrong for Abraham yet he owned the whole thing he said it today the true believer he's cast out from among the people called a fanatic Holy Roller some kind of an insulting name some kind of a religious fanatic and yet is heir to the whole heavens and earth deston of the meek they shall inherit the earth oh my he said talk about push you out on a cabinet somewhere hardly enough money to pay your rent yet you own at all have to work and toil and sweat for a few dollars to make an honest living to put shoes on your children's feet then feed their little hungry mouths yet on heir to everything that's here the meek shall inherit the earth they possess it he said oh my highlight that possessor of the earth what is the believer the believer has a title abstract need that's right by Jesus Christ that he should be the possessor of the entire universe the meek shall inherit the earth Alleluia mark 16:15 we have an heir we have a right or he proves the right to mark 16 that we he says I'm going into all the world preach the gospel to every creature now that part of it is just as much a ride as the rest of it we have a right to preach the gospel to every creature he to believe it that his baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe hey Ben this is what the Holy Ghost guarantees to you it's what the Holy Ghost guarantees to you you say well I don't see it in my life look most of the time when we don't see it in our lives either it's because we're expecting something great and it's in the details of our lives or sometimes it's because that's our sin in our life one of those two things many times keeps Christians from taking hold of the promises of God and you you can't live with your eyes just fully focused on this world and have the rights enforced in your life because while you're not looking something's gonna slip in you have to maintain your spiritual focus to take advantage of the promises of God Oh Church hear me today if there was ever an hour we should pray it should be today but there's never been an L it's harder to pray because of because of the hour that we live in if there was ever an hour we need to have church services where the power and the presence of God is so real in our midst but yet if there ever was an hour Satan fight sadist today why because he knows how we would benefit from it and he don't want to get it give it up so you gotta fight for it today more than you ever had but it's worth fighting for coming together to believe and in church and to bring our licks of fire together to come in one Accord in one place is worth fighting for it's worth the struggle to have a church that's on fire and it is hard but it's worth the struggle to have a place where people can come and sit in the in the blessings of the presence of God it's hard but it's worth the fight he said these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall the hands on the sick and they shall recover so the abstract says Easter still 1965 but the rent says when we believe on Jesus Christ for our Savior and repent and are baptized and come up to believe him God recognizes our repentance and our faith towards him and sends down the abstract and the abstract is the assurance it's the guarantee that everything excuse me that was ever held against you you thoroughly repented oh my that's where it stops for a lot of people you don't hear that preached anymore but you have to thoroughly repent you've got to be willing to surrender yourself to God and there's a lot of people who don't go out and do some great sin who've never really committed and surrendered themselves to God they've not surrendered their work to God have not surrendered their home life to God and so there's a whole lot of people that are just not 100% surrender and that surrender is a constant thing because Paul says I keep under my body bring it under subjection lest having preached to others i myself should be disapproved to cast away because it's a long - it's a fight I surrenders every day Paul says I die daily every day I surrender every day I've got to give up every day I've got to maintain and see when we enforce our rights to the abstract we're enforcing his rights the rights that the original owner had and by doing that we give up our rights as human beings there was a document of the French Revolution there was modeled somewhat after the Declaration of Independence it was called the rights of man the rights of man and they had certain rights that men would have there in that revolution but what they found out is that man can't even force his own enforce his own rights and in order to be a Christian you've got to give up every one of those rights I hope you hear me now yes as a as a human being I have rights as an American citizen but when it comes to the gospel none of those rights get in the way of me serving God if they do they have to be laid down I heard brother Darrell Ward preach a message one time called the declaration of dependence declaration of dependence that's what it is we depend on him hey Ben he said everything was thoroughly repented and the property is bought and you hold the abstract for the assurance let somebody try to put you off the land say he belongs you with the abstract in your hand let him try to do it there ain't a law in the land can do it because you hold the abstract and there's no devil no church or any theology that can overstep the boundaries of God's proof and abstract that the baptism of the holy ghost has recognized us in Jesus Christ we're just as sure to raise as he raised because potentially we have already raised in him he says and what does it do to our mortal bodies it turns our opinion changes our notions it sets our affections on things which are above do you remember what it was like when you become a Christian and this is harder as I said some of us get accomplished when we raised in the message because we never drank we never smoked we never gambled but something had to change we still had to be changed it turns our opinion changes our notions sets our affections on things which are above and the smoking drinking gambling the things that you used to do is dead it's beneath you and you are quickened and this quickening power brings your body into a raptured condition oh I hope you hear me that's well I don't believe there's anything that stands between us and the rapture if you're a born again child of God with the abstract there's no eighth messenger that's got to come there's no there's no person that stands we have to believe this doctrine or go here to church or do this know you're in a raptured condition already because she received the abstract in this hour with the with the with the word being revealed in the book being opened when you received the token today it puts you into a message of the hour that's ready for the skies so you he said he said this quickening power brings your body into a raptured condition already huh already he said notice him I my nose is running I'm not sick I've got allergies and when I get to preaching they think it comes I starts manifesting itself and I don't know why that is I'm sorry what does it do he said it turns our opinions that changed our notions he already read that he said trends your body to a rapture condition already said notice the Pentecostal people up there when they got quickened by the Holy Spirit he said listen to me when those Pentecostal group up there on the day of Pentecost received their abstract need from God it glorified their souls they screamed they saw tongues of fire separated upon each of them and it's so quick in their body till they couldn't even speak in an earthly language anymore it quickened their body to a heavenly language the place they're going to quickening power of God shook their mortal body so till their entire mortal language was transfigured transformed into an immortal language said what a quickening power he said what's something that belongs oh my said it changed their language into a language that belonged oh my don't you realize it did that it quickened your more body it made you into somebody that belonged in heaven hey you didn't belong in heaven but he changed your soul quick in that seat until you were somebody to belong there I'm a citizen of heaven I don't belong here let them riot let them do whatever they want to do I don't belong here I belong in heaven oh I believe in being a citizen of this country I believe in that I I believe in the taking advantage of my rights as a citizen but but not when it crosses my rights to heaven I'm a citizen of heaven first I know brother brother Robert Wilson has four four citizenships he worked for IBM and and so it's helped him in missionary work but he he's a citizen of Canada and the UK and Ghana and the US and those for citizenship gives him rights beyond what other people would have but I noticed when he goes overseas forgive me brother Robert if you listen to this but it'll use his his American passport it'll go use his American passport when he can because that's what gives him the most rights when you cross through those little those little places and if you've traveled you know that he cross to those little places there's more respect there there's something about holding that American abstract or that American I'm sorry that that American identification American passport you got an American passport that's what he shows oh my I've got a passport for heaven that's what I want to show what I want to show I got a passport to another land oh yes I'm a citizen of America yes I belong in the city and in the community but I got a passport to heaven that's what I want to work under what a walk under wanna treat others under that passport oh I want to act like Ana if I'm gonna be an America need to act like an American be an American if I'm gonna be a Christian I need to act like a Christian being a Christian being an ambassador because I don't belong here and we're a small community there's not very many of us don't belong here not very many hold that passport so we have to be a good representation well the random he said something that belongs if the spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in your mortal bodies it shall also quicken your mortal bodies we are quick and then by the power of the Living God tongues quick into a new heavenly language to speak to them a rap string up raising up into a different atmosphere than what they never lived in hey man also with the new quickening life to them that coming in at quick in their language they spoke in new tongues he said now watch them it was also designed to give them after this abstract it was designed to give them every promise that was on the ground every promise on the grounds of God's Word that was promised in the Bible that quickening power was give to them to quicken that promise to them he said therefore they laid hands on the sick they would feel this in new tongues they've done great signs and wonders because that was in God's promise when Jesus died to redeem that back to them the grounds have long the sons of God he demonstrated what God was he said how dare we socialize that put it into an organization we have no rights to do that he said but it's the Holy Spirit today hunting out honest hearts that will believe that message everything in the Bible that was promised it's to that believer hey man and when you accepted in his fullness and God knows that you'll do it he gives you the abstract to that and that every promise that's made in is in your possession and the Holy Spirit is there to quicken that to you I'm closing with this do you believe it today every Christian is it right to every promise of God hear me today if you haven't heard anything that I've said so far hear this every Christian also has a responsibility to drive the devil off of his property it's not just a right it's a responsibility What did he say the land is mine forever this belongs to God and when Satan comes into my home and squashed down and tries to make himself present in my life tries to make him my himself my everyday companion I have a right and I also have a responsibility to get rid of it and it's ultimately his we are in him and that he bought the land that he paid for the land that he redeemed back to us belongs to us because of him and we have a responsibility you see the longer wait to kick the devil off of your property the harder it will be to do it he just makes himself comfortable he builds himself a little home there in the living room just got all his snacks and his candy the longer you wait the more junk you're gonna have to drag out and the more likely it will be that you'll miss something and you have to deal with it later you ever had a house guess it was real messy I have a sister bless her heart Becky I love my sister but she leaves something every time she comes and stays we have something of Becky's every time and so after she leaves my wife just goes and looks because she knows she's going to find something of Becky's every time that's the way the devil is he comes which we finally get around to getting rid of him and he's left stuff we just can't seem to have the joy that we did we don't understand it can't seem to have the peace that was once president our lives we don't seem to understand it it's because the devil left something there let some Cheetos behind the couch he left some stuff been below to you you don't want that nasty stuff Oh God the longer you wait the harder it will be to do it every day he becomes stronger every year he becomes stronger it's still possible but every day you wait every time we hear the word and refuse to believe it he gets bolder he does every time we give him he gets bolder and that's why Jesus even taught them to take a radical steps and so he's setting an extreme example he says if your eye offends you pluck it out the internet offends you get rid of it you can't deal with the phone get rid of it if your eye offends you pluck it out if you've got a friend that's dragging you down huh let go of them sometimes you have to take drastic steps because the longer you wait the harder it is to bring your life into line with the word second Peter 2:19 speaks of those who would would be what would actually promise people things did not deliver which we see so many today tell evangelist and the light promising Liberty to the people but it says well they promise them Liberty they themselves with the servants of corruption four of whom a man is overcome of the same as he brought in bondage so he's saying when an enemy comes and in that day slaves were a hot commodity that's how they made their money they would start a war just to go get slaves and so of whom a man is overcome if he wins the battle against you he didn't put you in bondage he doesn't just leave you and come back later but he puts you in bondage you got to break out of that he said well a Booma man has overcome of the same as he brought in bondage for if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ they are again entangled therein and overcome the latter end is worse with them than the beginning it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness then after they have known it to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them I know we changed drastically but I just really feel like that we need to hear it I need to hear it this is part of enforcing our rights is taking our responsibilities when God brother Brent says sends the Holy Ghost and knocks at a man don't man's door and he deliberately turns it down sometime he's going to turn it down for his last time he said well God never knocked at my door did you realize that what you were doing was wrong when you did it was God knocking at your door first time you ever put your hand in the cookie jar and you pulled it back out and you knew you weren't supposed to be in it you felt bad God what's knocking at your door he keeps knocking he Bears long with us he said but sometime he's going to turn it for his last time he said and then you won't be a privileged character yours how privileged we are his message believers how privileged we are to be able to hear a message of deliverance with so many abound is so many are unable to overcome we have the ability to overcome we have the ability we have the understanding we have these things that we mean realize the importance of that the privilege that that is but he said you won't be a privileged character if you turn it down for the last time you can sit in a church and listen to the gospel and agree with the gospel you might do this as much as say I know it's right but never put a finger on it to help it yourself see said you just listen to it because you say I believe it's right that's just sympathizing with it I could say I believe that's the $10,000 I don't mean I got it I could say that's good cold water but refuse to drink it oh god I wonder you coming as I've said before if you've come if you come I don't want to see anybody quit coming to church every person on that that's alive on the face of this earth has a right to come to the house of God and I want to become the house of God but remember if you just let that water pour over you constantly and you never get born again you just become more rotten you just become more rotten if you say that's good cold water but you never drink of it you just become more thirsty but you become dehydrated until you don't know that you're thirsty he said in this is eternal life it refused to do it one day you'll cross the line between judgment and mercy and you won't have the privilege to come and where save it if there's something infringing on your rights as a Christian get rid of it take it off and I'm speaking especially to us now we think of physical healing when we think of this but so many other things that the devil can come in and make us wear we're not living to our potential as children of God get rid of it you get a little idea or a little thought people are against you us how quickly the devil can make that a complex and then turn it into insanity in your life where are you actually going acting rationally because you get a root of bitterness you won't have the privilege one day to come and receive healing from that the other part of the year of Jubilee is that if the slave refused to go free and reclaim his rights to Liberty the day of Jubilee he could never be free again don't you want to be free I know it's heavy I don't mean for it to be that way but listen we have responsibilities as Christians just rights not just privileges but responsibilities we've got to step up say Lord if there's something that you know to do is wrong and I don't believe that I have to go down a list that some do it and say this is wrong and this is wrong this is wrong you know but if there's something you know is wrong don't excuse it kick it off do what it takes to get rid of it it's worth it it's worth it it's about our heads together don't let sin set in your life it's not worth it's not worth it to let it sit there it's worth it to get rid of it if there's something in your life that's not right and just talk to him I'm not saying you're not a Christian many times I find myself repenting because we all everyday miss the mark and thank God for the atonement for the blood of Christ and as has been said so many times eloquently over this pulpit and others that it's not up to our works it's a to Christ but we need to stay covered by the blood we have a responsibility you're not going to be lost if you're a Christian today you will not be lost but you have a responsibility to get rid of the devil to stand up and be a real Christian to be a child of God could we sing that I fill the pole in G I fill the pole if you know them could we just talk to the Lord for a moment and say Lord I'm I just want to be the kind of Christian that you want me to be it helped me to enforce my rights or maybe it's healing maybe it's something else you just let the devil beat you up over and over again on that don't let him do that the devil try to tell you're not forgiven the devil tried to tell you you're not up you can't be a Christian after your life being the way that it was or maybe something happened to you and you were a child and things have just been odd for you ever since and you think well I can never be normal don't buy that don't accept that you let God move in your life let God take care of those things he can do it he can do miracles in your life so you've got to be willing to let him and when a father is I come to this somber part of the service and knowing or that I'm speaking mostly to Christians today it may seem strange Lord but father I pray you'd cleanse us of all of our sins so many times Lord I myself will pray that way Lord forgive me of my sins not that I believe that you've not forgiven me not that I don't recognize Who I am and that I'm justified but that I've been filled with the Holy Spirit I've been sealed but yet I know that there's things that I do that's not pleasing to you and so lord I ask you to forgive me may we do that today so body give us where we failed you preaching it's not always just shouting and running sometimes it's hard Oh God would you just help us to recognize Lord that you want what's best for us whatever it is in our life that you don't want us to live underprivileged you don't want us to live with temptation all the time and trouble and struggle that we give in to Lord you want us to overcome we're so grateful we could be an overcomer Lord I pray for each and every person sitting in the sound of my voice today or watching Lord this morning I pray that you just move in our lives and we've gotten a little free with the truth and we haven't always spoken like we should the truth Oh God would you help us today would you help us to always tell the truth Lord if there's something that maybe in the business feel if something got a little shady Oh God help us Lord we want to be right if there's something that we've just kept in but it's hard to the world may not see it but you see it helped us sort to be completely clean order when we come to your house we can worship you without any with an understanding of what your blood did for us without any condemnation father I pray that you just move in our midst and wipe out everything that's unlike you I pray Lord that your bleach would just pour down in every heart just eliminate everything that's unlike you and send it back on the ones that did it in the first place I pray your granite father or Jesus weep lord I don't speak just of this church but these are good people but art I speak of us as a whole as the people in the message to the Lord we need revival we need you to speak again in our churches we need you to speak in our homes Lord we need you hard we can't make it without you we know there won't be a world sweeping revival again but Oh God would you just come down in this place this morning just speak to us once again or cleanse out everything that's unlike you and may your presence be so real among us and when we leave this place we couldn't say anything or do anything that would be outside your will I pray your granite Lord God maybe they're so close to the cross that others can see yes he's a man yes he's a human yes he made mistakes he makes mistakes but that man is a Christian that woman is a Christian I pray you granite Lord God we thank you for your presence thank you for being with us this morning and for all these that have come we ask your blessings in Jesus name Amen amen could we stand and sing it together and just talk to the Lord while you sing him just just worship
