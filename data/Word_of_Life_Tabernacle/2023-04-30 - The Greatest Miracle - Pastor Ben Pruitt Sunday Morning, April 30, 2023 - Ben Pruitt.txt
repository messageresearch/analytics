are in need Lord we'll give you the praise and the honor and the glory in Jesus name and God bless you turn with me to John chapter 3 and verse 1 John 3 and 1. we'll read down to verse 8. good to have our visitors with us today God bless you guys and uh good to have uh all of you with us I want to thank you for helping us on the work day yesterday didn't they do a good job out here on the landscaping and everything amen I I just really appreciated those that helped I know some of you wanted to come and or able to but we had a good crowd a good bunch of people helping out so we're thankful for that and and there's still a few things to be done but most of it got done yesterday so we're we're thankful for that and and it's always good when God's people can get together to work and and do something for the cause and I want to thank you for doing that giving your Saturday to that purpose uh John chapter 3 and verse 1 it says there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews the same came to Jesus by night and said unto him Rabbi we know that thou art a teacher come from God for no man can do these Miracles that thou doest except God be with him Jesus answered and said unto him verily verily I say unto you and that word there verily it's an exclamation he's saying absolutely I say unto you except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God and Nicodemus saith in him how can a man be born when he is old and he entered the second time into his mother's womb and and be born Jesus answered verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is Spirit Marvel not that I say unto thee you must be born again the wind bloweth where it listeth and thou Hearst the sound thereof but canst not tell whence it cometh and whether it goeth so is everyone that is born of the spirit I pray the Lord without his Blessing to the word you may be seated this morning we believe in miracles we believe that we serve a miracle-working god and we live in an age of Miracles not only Supernatural miracles from God but we live in an age of of an economic miracle that we have the things that we have it's an age of of a miracle of medicine that we have many of the medicines and things that we do some of us it seems like the doctors Keep Us Alive sometimes and and so it's a it's an age of medical Miracles it's an age of scientific Miracles when if you took somebody from a hundred years ago they would not understand what's going on today at all they they just wouldn't be able to comprehend what was happening in the world today there's Rockets flying up in the air and and satellites out there and we're able all the information in the world right or wrong is right on our fingertips and we're able to Google and and and whatever that you use to get that information and that's a miracle a scientific miracle in the day that we live in and yet during that same time Satan is actually deceiving the People by these scientific Miracles and these uh these miracles of of Commerce and miracles of uh of a culture that we live in today Satan is using that to deceive the people to set himself up as a God over the people to be the God of this evil age and yet during this same time we are actually seeing a miracle of God Among the bride that that there's a miracle that's being done that God is bringing a people out of laodicea how many believe that today God will have a people he will have a bride that will be a character like he wants a bride to be that will that will not fall in this age The Pride that will be what he wants her to be in I'm so grateful to be part of that Pride today so we can say that the greatest Miracle of this day or any day is the new birth it's when God takes a unconverted person and converts them and and makes them new a new creation and and we say that because of we know the condition of the unconverted and I want us to to look at that for just a moment because we need to recognize what's been done in our life you know if anybody ought to believe in miracles it should be us if there's anybody that ought to know that God is real it ought to be us because every one of you that are born again today every single one of you that have had a changed life whether you grew up in church or or your family was out of church on drugs alcohol whatever it is but your life has been changed and there was a miracle done in your life every one of you have had a supernatural event in your life and you know you what you came from you're not what you were you may not be what you want to be but you're not what you were and so it's supernatural event that's taken place and you can stand here and say I'm a I'm a product of a miracle and so I believe in Supernatural I've seen God working so I believe that God works I believe he's the same yesterday today and forever I believe that all things are possible if anybody ought to believe in miracles it ought to be us today right and and we see the condition of the unconverted our condition in the flesh without God our condition without God is to be a sinner brother Branham tells us he said first we reckon ourselves Sinners and worthy of condemnation and we are all born in sin and shaped in iniquity there's not a sound parcel of us you might as well just admit it this morning I'm the same well there's not a sound parcel you like to be able to say well you know this part of me was bad but that part of me was good now he said there's no part of you that's good not a sound parcel of us our minds are bad we ought to know that in this day and age our minds are bad our soul is corruptable our constant thinking is evil and he's talking about the unconverted he said every imaginary thought of a man's mind is evil a sinner he said and also our body is weak our spirit is no good and we're just full of corruption that's the state of the unconverted but I'm so glad he did a miracle in my life I'm so glad he changed me I'm so glad he reached down his hand for me and pulled me up out of the things of the world and he changed my mind he changed my thoughts he changed everything about me yeah that's good and so the Bible tells us that God saw that the wickedness of Man was created the Earth and this is before salvation notice that the whole world had gotten so bad that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually this is the state of the Sinner and I want to tell you this morning if you're not converted if you've not given your life to Christ if you've not been sealed by the Holy Ghost this is the state that you're living in that the thoughts of your heart are only evil continually exclusively Bad Evil continually he said I just can't believe that brother Ben you have to recognize that in order to be saved you have to yeah Job 14 and 1 says the man is born that is born of a woman is a few days and full of trouble you cometh forth like a flower and is cut down he fleth also as a shadow and continuous not and just now open Thine Eyes Upon such a one and bring us me into judgment with thee and look what he says he said who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean right and we are in our unconverted state unclean he said who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean who by doing 12 steps by reforming and those things are good and and they have their place but you can't bring a clean thing out of an unclean you can't by the process of your mind make yourself live and do and follow the words of Christ you can't just make yourself do that there's got to be a supernatural element to it there's got to be a part of you there's got to be something on the inside that Wheels you to that because you'll find that there will be a point in your life when you can't even come to church anymore they'll be a point in your life you don't feel like being a Christian you don't feel like going after God you'll be disappointed by people you'll be disappointed by preachers you'll be disappointed by Churches there'll be a time in your life when you'll be so disappointed by family and everybody else that you'll just be about ready to give up and it'll be at that moment when that Miracle begins to take place in your life begins to take precedence he said I didn't save you to lose you it takes a miracle to hold you it takes something Supernatural to keep you in the house of God it something Supernatural it takes something that changes your desires until you want to be in church more than you want to be at the pool hall you want to be in the house of God more than you want to be in the woods or somewhere else you want to be in the house of God listening to the word of God more than you want other things miracle in your life and I don't care how religious it you are I don't care how many times you go to church or even how many times you preach how many times you've come to an altar until that Miracle takes place in your life that changes your desire you still need God you're still in that same condition right sir yes sir who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean well I'll reform I'll be better you can't do it yeah it takes God you believe that today brother Brown said you stick your bucket down into the well and pull out a bucket of water and it's stagnant it stinks you're looking and it's muddy and little worms is in the water and there's no way at all to put your bucket back and get a clean bucket the whole well is contaminated the whole soul mind and body of man is contaminated with sin born in sin physically shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies so that his own soul is contaminated nothing good one cannot redeem the other because it's all wrong then you can't take a bucket full of water here that's contaminated and another bucket full that's contaminated and mix them together you've got more contamination that's why you can't say well I'll follow a prophet and then I'll be all right can't take a contaminated bucket a human being and by following another human being make yourself right there was only one uncontaminated bucket and that was Jesus Christ [Applause] you can't pick a bucket full of water this containment and say well I'll be more like Kim I'll be like the pastor I'll I'll follow the path I'll do what the pastor says that's not going to make you uncontaminated I'll listen to a prophet that's good we should I'll do it that's good we should do it a prophet says we should do what the Bible says but that will uncontaminate you you need a miracle in your life yes no preacher can redeem you yeah no Pope can redeem you going to church by itself won't redeem you going to church won't make you want to go to church right God acting like a Christian won't make you want won't change your desires really be a Christian but if you ever get converted on the inside if you ever if that if that Holy Ghost can fire ever takes a hole on the inside and burns up all the atmospheres and fits it'll change you it'll make you want to be in the house of God I am I think of David in Psalm 51 5 he said behold I was shaping in iniquity he was desperate he was desperate because he'd messed up we recognized he said I need help I need Supernatural help he said I need forgiveness I was shaping an iniquity and sin did my mother conceive me I know some people say well you know he does bad things but he has a good heart let me tell you what the Bible says the Bible says the heart is deceitful Above All Things and desperately wicked well I know this is this is a little bit a little bit hard but it's the truth what the Bible says the heart is desperately wicked the unconverted heart is desperately wicked who can know it it goes on to say I the Lord try the hearts Lord aren't you glad that he does aren't you glad he can see the heart but the heart itself is deceitful people today we'll tell you follow your heart do what your heart tells you to do you need to listen to your heart and the truth is that's the worst thing you could follow because your heart will lead you away your heart will make you think you let you love someone other than your spouse your heart will make you think that that you that you've been wounded too many times to come to the house of God your heart will make you think that that you can't serve God no more that it would be easier to go a different way but if you ever get a converted Soul it'll take precedence over that and it'll begin to dominate that that heart that seed of your emotions hey man and so you know when we talk about the miracle of conversion the miracle is not that we chose to be saved and we're saved but that we were saved in spite of our free will yes amen I'm so glad I got a God I serve a God that's bigger than my free will bigger than what I wanted bigger than what aren't you glad that that gives you hope for your children doesn't it that gives you hope for your family because he's bigger than their desires he's bigger than their Free Will he's bigger than all of that he's able to change them to change their desires to change what they wanted oh my they made this they may be headed straight for hell with all that they can do they can run straight for it but God reached down his hand and supernaturally changes their mind and then they come to God by free will but they never would have unless he'd have done something in their life supernaturally changed them the Bible says all we like sheep have gone astray all we like sheep but the Caleb bets I like those goats that your wife said was coming down your lane that's what goats do that's what sheep do if you let them out of the pen they wander off and they wandered together in herds usually but they wander off and one follows the other and they don't even know why if you ask that last goat why he left the other ones did it everybody else did it so I did it too everybody else was drinking so I drank too everybody else smoked I smoked too everybody else was carrying on with women so I did it too everybody else was living that kind of life I did it too oh we like sheep have gone astray we have turned everyone to his own way his own way that original word is Derek it is the word that's used in train up a child in the way he should go I preached that to you before it's taken from a root word which means a bow the the wood that they would pick for a bow it's bent a certain direction and so he says we have turned everyone to his own Derek it's to his own way to his own bent whatever we wanted to be whatever our whatever our DNA made us whatever our families were whatever whatever events shaped Us in life we just continued that way as the tree falls so it leans we we or as it leans so it falls we just kept going we just kept leaning we just kept moving that direction and what we would be today is just that without the Holy Ghost without the miracle of God in our life we have gone astray and we have gone our own way we have leaned and we have fallen in our own our own particular sin whether it's self-righteousness ungodliness it's all sin aren't you glad for a savior today whether you were raised in church and you you thought well I I go to church I pay my tithes I'm a good person but if you've been born again because you've lean your own way you go your own way until the shepherd comes the Bible says for you where is sheep going astray but are now returned aren't you glad to have returned today you have now returned unto the shepherd you were always a Sheep amen you were a stray you went astray but the shepherd went and found you and now you have returned to the shepherd you've returned to the shepherd and Bishop of your souls Hallelujah in Luke 15 1 he tells us how we return to the shepherd because many times we think well let's buy our own efforts we we strove and we fought and we we tried and eventually we got back but look what the shepherd does in Luke 15 1 it says all the publicans and sinners Drew near to hear him and the Pharisees and the scribes murmured saying this man receive his Sinners and eateth with them and he's faked this Parable unto them saying what man of you having a hundred sheep if he lose one of them so and watch the Sheep were his the Sheep belonged to the bishop the shepherd the bishop is the great Shepherd it belonged to the shepherd and so the shepherd had sheep and now he's going to go after the Sheep his sheep he's not going after anybody else's but he says my sheep know my voice so if he found you you were one of his aren't you glad for that today all out of that ought to make his child that ought to make us excited because if he found you you were already one of his you were in his mind before the foundation of the earth if he found you you belong to him he does not find those who do not belong to him if he found you he found you for a reason and he says he goes off in the wilderness until he find it and when he has found it when he hath found it the Sheep is wandering around in the wilderness bleeding and crying it's been wounded or whatever that's happened to the Sheep while it's out there it's gone its own way and here comes the shepherd and he goes and he finds it it does not come to him it's gone so far it can't hear his voice it doesn't recognize who he is but he comes down to where the Sheep is he may have to climb a mountain he may have to go in the desert he may have to get up on a rock he may have to go through gravy leaks to get to you but he's going where you are and then people today say well come as you are and there's some truth to that but we don't want you to stay as you are but I tell you what it's you it's not you coming as you are but it's him coming to you and he'll find you no matter if you're sitting on a bar stool no matter if you're sitting in a church pew wherever you are he'll find you and when he finds you you're his he gonna put you on his shoulders Hallelujah Hallelujah aren't you glad to be a sheep this morning it's a miracle that he found me it's a miracle that he put me on his shoulders and when he put me on his shoulders what happened I was on the strongest part of him yeah yeah oh that makes me the strength of a man who's in his shoulders the Bible says the government is upon his shoulders when he found me he put me on the strongest part of him there's no danger of me going out again there's no danger of me being lost again there's no danger of me being overtaken by somebody else by some wolf and taking off in the wilderness shoulders for me to die he'd have to die Hallelujah that's why you can't even believe this Earth till he's done with you when he found me put me on his shoulders isn't that a great thought so I know it's simple but he found me put me on his shoulders he carries me on his shoulders rejoicing Hallelujah he doesn't just well I found another sheep stupid sheep got lost again had to go find it you know grumbling oh that's not what he does but when he finds it yeah come on he rejoices and when you see a sinner rejoicing that's been saved when you see when you see a church rejoicing because people got saved they're they're only rejoicing because he is rejoicing and when a sinner saved the Angels Rejoice why do the Angels Rejoice he rejoice glory to God it's not us rejoicing it's him rejoicing through us I found my Sheep amen Hallelujah when he cometh home call it together as friends and neighbors and says let's have a good old Pentecostal meeting Rejoice with me for I have found my sheep which was lost Hallelujah see you always were his sheep brother Branham taught us he said we did not become seed by the rebirth we were feed and therefore were reborn for only the elect can be reborn because of Hallelujah because we were seen it's the reason we could be quickened in non-seed there is nothing to Quicken quit letting the devil beat you up about well you're not a Christian you're not a child of God you can't be saved you're you're not really at the elect of God did he find you come on Church did he find you if he found you found you then you're one of his [Music] Hallelujah if he found you you're a child of the king you're one of his sheep so he found you only the elect can be reborn Hallelujah because we were seed is the reason we could be quick and oh non-seed can feel good they can have they can participate in a Revival they can even go to church but there's something holding you what is it you're on his shoulders you're his sheep you belong to him only elect can be reborn because we were seeing there's a reason we could be quickened and non-seed there's nothing to Quicken he said hold this carefully in mind he said now take the next step redeem means to buy back it restores to the original owner God by his death the shed blood brought back his own he bought back the spoken word seed bride my sheep hear my voice the word and they follow me you always were a sheep you never were a pig or a dog turned into a sheep you said but you don't know the kind of Life I Lived that was just the sticky nature on the outside but somewhere in there was a seed that just hadn't been awakened yet it hadn't been quickened yet but it was there and so it had to be there he couldn't find you but when he found you you were Reborn Hallelujah you never were a pig you never were a dog turned into a sheep that is impossible for every kind of Life produces the same kind there is no change in species as we were in the thoughts of God and then expressed in flesh there had to come a day when he would hear his voice the word and hearing that voice become aware of our father calling us and recognize that we are the sons of God oh hear his voice today if you've never been converted you've never been found hear his voice today he's calling to you it's calling to you young people you children yes hear his voice you're one of his he wants to put you on his shoulders he wants to take away all the doubt and the frustration of fear and the worry he wants you to trust him amen he said if we were in the thoughts of God we read that he said we heard his voice and we cried out as did The Prodigal Son Save Me O my father I am returning to thee the prodigal son was in a big pen but he was not a pig he was eating pig food but he was not a pig I was in a pig pen one day I was eating pig food but I was not a pig amen Hallelujah I just feel the presence of the Lord this morning don't you believe anything is possible in the presence of the Lord Hallelujah brother Brandon tells his Eagle story you all know him the little story of the egg was left maybe some of the children haven't heard it the egg that was left there in the farmers in the farmers the farmer pounded and he brought it there to his chicken coop he puts it among the other eggs and it hatches because all it takes for an egg to hatch his atmosphere so it hatches they're in a chicken coop but it's different yeah there's something about it that's different yes it eats chicken food but it doesn't like it it's taught to cluck and to stay on the ground and to move around scratching in the dirt we were talking last night about how stupid chickens are because they just they just they just walk around and and and you know you you can cut their head off it don't make much difference in their life you know they just kind of keep acting like they always do I don't know if you've ever seen that but I have we used to cook them we used to catch them anyway the skill involved in that by the way but the chickens are pretty dumb you know they just say they're just pretty close to the ground they can't fly very far they can fly but they don't like to but they're going to get a little ways above the ground you know and they want to get back on the ground pretty quick but the Eagles a different sort of bird ain't looked different he talked different but he didn't know really how to talk because he'd never heard an eagle tall so he tried to cluck like the chickens yeah he tried to scratch like the chickens and he's getting busy down there doing that and he's getting he's starting to grow and as he grows he becomes more and more unlike them yeah he's out of place and so he's sitting down there in a chicken pen and and the and the old hens around him saying clucking brother said saying days of Miracles has passed right God don't do that no more that's the hen clucky God don't have preachers no more God don't have church no more God don't you don't have to you know we just we moved past that that's the hen clucking I don't do Miracles no more so it's just a cluck in denominational uh clucking just down there cratching in the dirt and trying to get the grubs and the worms but one day Mama Eagle knew she had another egg she had another baby that was there somewhere and so she went looking for it and she's flying over the Barnyard and she begins to scream as only an eagle can and when she screams illegal oh my God I've heard that yeah yeah when I heard this message from myself I'd heard it growing up but when I heard it from myself one day I heard it all of a sudden I heard something wow there's something about that that's eternal there's something about that that's real and I heard it when I heard it it's something about that said that's Supernatural there's something more than just a man there's got to be something to it something real and so I I you begin to look up and you begin to say Lord where are you and she screamed again here I am en he couldn't go out of the Barnyard he couldn't rescue himself he couldn't make himself a I couldn't make himself fly in the heavenlies but she had to teach him little little Eagle screamed back and said Mama she said fly in the heavenlies he said I can't she said well just jump up on that post amen jump up as far as you can jump and then just trust the wind because once you get up here the Holy Ghost is going to lift you once you jump in Release Yourself to the wind the whole don't be scared of coming to the Holy Spirit don't be scared of giving your life to Christ because if you're an eagle once you get in that wind you get in those days it begins to pull you they don't have to Flap like a chicken but they just set their wings Hallelujah oh that's what we were yeah brother I'm just going to keep telling stories I guess brother Brown tells the story about the duck you've all heard it the duck and the duck is different he's at the chicken bin and the little duck he just he'd never been around water but he's built for water yeah and one day the old chicken the old hen let him out a little bit too far out of the Barnyard and he gets close enough to the pond he can smell the water and when he smells the water he goes straight for the bar for the pond quacking as hard as he can it didn't have that effect on any of the rest of them but it had that effect on him why he was a duck to begin with Hallelujah now we know how do you love him this morning [Music] there can be no Miracle of the new birth without death that's right Genesis 2 17 the Bible says of the trend of knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it and they thou he deserve thou shall surely die we know they ate from it and their sin that they did and God required death Nicodemus in John 3 and 9 he picks up the story as we pick up from where our texts were that we read Nicodemus answered and said unto him how can these things be he said I don't understand it I have a hard time grasping a new birth what does that even mean he said you must be born again and he thought he was going to tell him oh here's how you get closer to God keep these Commandments and walk so far every day and and cleanse yourself in a certain pool he didn't tell him that he didn't tell him go go listen to tapes at a certain times that's legalism he didn't tell him go go and wash yourself up make yourself quit quit smoking quit drinking quit doing all that that's all he told him he said you must be born again yeah are you with me now you must be born again demon said I don't understand it I was waiting for a set of instructions yeah but being born against a supernatural thing it doesn't come with a set of instructions home yes sir but it comes with the wisdom of the Holy Ghost the teacher brother Branham that says In this passage he said Nicodemus said you're we know you're a great teacher that comes from God he said Jesus corrected him he said the teacher is coming the Holy Ghost hey man I can't teach you nothing because you're not born again yeah right and so and so now he's looking for a teacher he's looking for a 12-step program something to to step him through but that's not what God brought now Jesus answered and said to him art thou a master of Israel and no it's not these things verily verily I say to you absolutely I say unto you we speak that we do know amen and testify what we've seen Glory you receive not our Witness he said if I told you Earthly things and you believe not now you know he's seeing miracles happen right things that he could he knew the lame walk the dead were raised he said if you don't believe that that's Earthly things how are you believe if I tell you Heavenly things he said no man has to send it up to heaven but he that come down from heaven even the son of man which is in heaven boy now he just opens up the word so if you can take it Nicodemus is scratch and said what is he talking about and as Moses lifted up to up this wilderness now watch where he goes now with the new birth even so must the son of man be lifted up that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life so he had to die on the cross aren't you glad that he did verse 16 for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life for God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten son of God and this is the condemnation that light is coming to the world and Men love Darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil so he said for everyone that doeth evil hateth the light neither cometh to the light lest his deeds should be reproved but he that doeth truth cometh to the light that his deeds may be made manifest Terror in God so he's saying there has to be a death that takes place not only the death of the Redeemer but there has to be a death take place in the subject of the Oneness to be born again because in order to be a new creature he's got to die to the old creature in order to come into a supernatural birth he's got to die to what's already living and already reigning in his soul in order to be married to Christ the old man has to die all right so now it's he said he the truth comes to the light so he said and that should tell us what the evidence of the Holy Ghost is by the way the evidence of the new birth is not shouting it's not speaking in tongues it's not feeling good but the evidence of the Holy Ghost is the life that follows it's Living the Life of Christ it's manifesting the life right right his deeds will be made manifest yes now brother Adam said there's an approach to this birth are you still okay this morning I hope we're okay he said there is approach to it and to be to approach this birth you have to go through a process just like anything that lives anything that lives has got to die first and you cannot keep your Same Spirit you cannot keep your same habits you cannot keep your same thoughts you've got to die you've got to die like he died you've got to die on this altar like Abel did with Islam he said what part of me has to die see this in order for the seed to come to life the shell that surrounds it has got to die it's the same way if you plant a seed out here in the ground that seed you know what happens first it dies and then it rots and when it's so dead that you think it could never come back in the spring it comes back again why because there's a germ of life you can't even see it with your eye you can only see it with a microscope but there's a germ of life down the inside of that seed that seems like it's dead and rotten but when it did when it's dead and it rots see while it's whole the nutrients from the soil and the atmosphere can't get to it that's why so many people never get truly born again because they're in the atmosphere but they've never died and because they've never died to themselves and their own ideas and their own habits and their own ways and they're still trying to well I'm going to be me I'm going to live like me I'm going to have my ideas and my thing you can't come to God like that you can't come come you've got to be like the eagle say teach me how to fly come on let me die to my own thoughts yeah and so you've got to die or you can't feel the influence of the atmosphere that you're in yeah oh my brother random says this he said you've got to die like he died you've got to die on his altar like Abel did with his lamb you got to die with your lamb you've got to die die your own thinking to be born in his thinking let the mind that was in Christ be in you you've got to feel so guilty when you stand in his presence whether you go the method of sway or the Baptist way or whatever way you go you've got to be so guilty and feel so guilty till it'll kill you amen your worldly life will die right there you've got to reckon yourself so guilty in the presence of God until your worldly life dies right there the sin questions over for you when you're standing in his presence oh that's the way it was for me how about you the sin question's over I'm not gonna be ruled by us anymore yes I make mistakes because the outside is still a sticky nature you make mistakes because the outside is still a sticky nature but there's something inside of you that will not let go will not let go why because there's something that sand us stood in his presence and no man can ever be in his presence and ever be the same right right amen Paul picks it up in Romans 6 he said what should we say then shall we continue in sin that Grace May abound because he said we're sin abounded Grace Super abounded Grace did much more abound he said God forbid how shall we that are dead to sin live any longer yeah yeah they're in know you not that so many of us as we're baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death therefore we are buried with him by baptism and to death and I've explained that to you before on baptism but when we're baptized there's a reason why we lay down in the water let the water cover us its burial right death burial and Resurrection right but if you don't die to your own self before you go down you'll go down a wet Center come up a dry one go down to dry Center come up a wetland that's how that works right because you you have to die oh my you've got to die he said if we've been planted together in the likeness of his death we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection knowing this that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be watched destroyed not coddled not not not pampered God help us today yeah I I don't want to be hard but we can't pan for sin we can't coddle sin it's got to be dealt with and I'll say this if I preach against sin without tears in my eyes there's something wrong with me it shouldn't be something you love to do but it's got to be dealt with because so many today have been baptized you see it in nominal churches all over the place people are being baptized oh we baptized 50 today and they go right back into their own thing I saw a video of a woman that had been baptized and she'd come up they said why are you being baptized she said well I want to be a warrior for God's Animal Kingdom I mean that's good I guess that's that's not why you get baptized you want to be you want to be a son or daughter of God you want to live with him are you with me now people get baptized they don't know why that's why everybody else is we'll just get baptized you know you need to die to yourself I'll say this if our children have a desire to be baptized we need to let them be baptized as soon as they're old enough to understand don't know hold them back because if you hold them back I've seen many times I think of a story right now of a young of a young person that was told that they by their parents said you're not ready your life's not right you shouldn't be baptized and I'm not trying to override parents here but a young man wanted to and today he doesn't today's a teenager has no interest in being baptized I say do it while while they want to do it while they want you say well I'm not going to push my child I I told my children they needed to be baptized they needed to repent first then they needed to be baptized well I'm not going to push them I'm not going to drag my kids to church are you not going to go they decide to stay home we can do leave them at home alone of course you're going to drag your children to church I was drunk to church brother Harvey was drugged to church we didn't want to go right kind of getting into the night sermon a little bit but but we you know little unconverted people they church is hard man you're sitting in church and we try to make it as easy for them as we can but you know it's just a guy talking for a couple hours it's hard you know they like spend time with their friends but they're thinking about something else you can't blame them for that say well they always act up when they're in church they will they'll do that but bring them to church bring them to the house of God set a standard in an example this is what we do on Sunday morning we go to the house of God it might be hard but this is what we do because here they have there's an atmosphere that if they ever repent if they ever begin to die to themselves that atmosphere will begin to get a hold and as soon as the light strikes the sea as soon as the atmosphere can get to the Sea and the death has taken place they'll be born again because they want to be baptized let them be baptized teach them right let them be baptized because they you don't know what God might do look we know that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed not not coddled destroyed and henceforth we should not serve sin for he that is dead is freed from sin but the brown said if you're born of God you're washed in the waters of the word separated from the things of the world and believe God you're dead you're dead to your own thinking did your own ideas dead to everything else but God's word and it lives in you working back through you proving that it is God's word you say I'm dead to the world brother Branham and deny God's word Jesus said these signs shall follow them that believe he said now we're getting down to what Born Again means he said still with tempered still mean arrogant well that got real real fast didn't it God help us today somebody say something about you you're right up ready to fight and then born of the spirit of God 's Spirit don't do like that God's spirit is humble Meek sweet long-suffering God help us today that's God loving kind forgiving that's God's spirit but they'll hold to that denomination he said speak in tongues prophesy do all kinds of works Jesus said they do it having a form of godliness hold to the denomination because that's their father right that's their origin they was born in that denominational father but if you're born of God this is your father he is the word hallelujah the word no matter how many Sensations you have still a child of Satan until you become dead to the world and alive in Christ are you with me now oh remember he's talking about that outer man the outer man is a slave to sin until you're born again it's in bondage to sin until you're born again don't knock the sinner because he sins that's what Sinners do that's just what they do I don't I don't look bad in a sinner because they sin that's Sinners we're going to do that they're going to get worse and worse and worse as time goes on but the Christian gets better and better and better what the sinner needs is to be born again they can't do that without the Life of Christ there have to be something there for them to do that and so we scattered the light knowing that there's some seed of God out there somewhere we wouldn't still be here Romans 6 8 now if we be dead with Christ we believe that we shall also live with him knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more so death is not the end death hath no more dominion over him in that he died he died unto sin once but in that he liveth he liveth unto God likewise reckon you also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin but not you're not just dead but you're alive unto God through Jesus Christ Our Lord said before birth can come we realize there has to be death before birth and a birth is a mess he said I don't care what kind of a birth it is if it's in a pig pen whatever it is it's a mess and so it's the new birth it makes you do things that ordinarily you wouldn't think you would do but when you're ready to die to yourself then you're born again a new creature in Christ Jesus then things open up and life becomes a new sight to you because you've accepted the person not the person of William Branham not the person of Ben Pruitt but the person of Jesus Christ right I hope I can lead you and not lead you astray I hope that you'll follow me as I follow Christ I hope that you'll do that but you cannot you cannot become my disciple you cannot become a new creature and been through it you cannot be born again and accept the person of being Pruitt you've got to accept the person of Jesus Christ not some Theory or some Creed or even to the written word it's got to be quickened by the Holy Spirit he said no matter how much theology you've got it's laying there dead I could have a handful of weed until it gets into the process to where it can be quick and we will never live you can have a doctorate's degree a phll whatever you wish to but until the Holy Spirit comes upon that and quickens it to you as a personal experience with God then the wheat does no good your learning is in vain he said this Englishman the other night he said I was so astonished at that all the learning he had his father he had to forget all he knew in order to find Christ do things that he thought he wouldn't do but that's the way God does he humiliates us in our educational system he said not as I'm trying to support ignorance but I'm trying to tell you the difference education can never bring life it takes the spirit of God to bring life and that life must not come out of just the intellectual Revival it's got to come out of the Bible word Revival notice how he separates the intellectual Revival from the word Revival and that word is the same yesterday today and forever when it falls today and quickens you get the same results you did in Acts 2. exactly it always has and always will be because it's the spirit of God that conditions that atmosphere the same results amen again you look at our children and say well they don't want to be in church of course not when they're little bitty they want to play they want to let them ever get born again of the spirit of God they'll drag you to church I just want them to be in that atmosphere the random said it takes atmosphere to do things he's continuing the same quote he said that's the reason you men are always taught bring your children here you men are always taught be a man bring your children to church don't send them bring them well certainly that's right he said I was glad to see my daughter Rebecca come in and sit down just a few minutes ago he said some of you see me wink at a woman it was my daughter so she came in and sat down now you remember because they'll reach an age you can't drag them no more right Rebecca had reached that age where you can't physically drag kids of a certain age Church it would be abuse I'll say this so you teach them right train them right when they're little they'll even come in when they're older and maybe they don't even know why they're there I don't know why I'm at church I've experienced that but my parents took me to church it was now his good church but it was church we went to baptist churches Methodist churches Pentecostal churches everything but Catholic churches we were in all kinds of trouble we were in church not three times a week four times a week five times a week camp meetings sometimes with Services three times a day we went to church so it's not difficult for me to go to church now yeah yeah right you train them and maybe someday they'll be sitting there almost an adult they're sitting there thinking what am I going to do with my life and all at once they they realize I I don't want to be a sinner seen what Uncle so and so did and and so and so on seeing what they did but I look at my mom and dad they're in church they're serving the lord I've seen how it changed their life I want that I see the example set in my home I see the example set at the church I want that I want to be a part of that and they'll at once they begin to get conviction in their heart and you see them start coming to an altar begin to pray what happens that that seed is dying that the outside the shell is dying because there's going to be new birth now you can't judge them because it's not they're not mature yet but still make mistakes be a lot of things happen between now and and that mature plant but you nurture that I want them to be in that atmosphere because if that seed ever rots to the outside and it gets even one little glimpse of the atmosphere it'll strike so we take them to meetings we take them to camps we we here in church we try to set the right kind of atmosphere because we want them we want them to be in that we we don't want to stay out of the house of God we want them here in the house of God and so brother Brown says some of he said you see me do that I wanted to receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit he said that's why she is here in the meeting he said that's the purpose of it it takes atmosphere yes the Bible tells us that the carnal mind is enmity against God take something to change that is not subject to the law of God neither indeed can be and then and even in the Old Testament he said I want to give you a new heart and a new spirit but that's not the new birth he said then I'll put my spirit in you there's the new birth but the new heart and the new spirit is part of the process you've got to go through that you need to be in that atmosphere to go through that listen you have a new nature now you're not perfect but your desires have changed now you asked he said brother Brandon what kind of nature have you got then his nature if I had my father's nature I do the things my father did you ever think you ever been sad that your kids had your nature my mother said amen I don't know what to do about that it's the second time of the week I've got on to her for saying amen I got to quit that but oh no but my heavenly father has a nature and now and now they're born again he said it depends on who my father was the church you got to want to you call him anything you want to because he's your father but if your father is God and you're born in the family of God you seek those things and pertain to God then you are God's child your nature is God's nature then when somebody said oh you hear them some say oh our church believes that the days of Miracles has passed how could you believe the days of Miracles has passed when the very nature of God is in you when he is all together miracle [Music] what is a miracle how do we explain it Wednesday night a miracle is something you can't explain something that has no answer to it something that no one can quantify It's Supernatural yet it's real and God you can't explain him it's he's in my thoughts are not your thoughts my ways are not your ways you can't explain him you can't quantify him but he's real Hallelujah he is all together miracle his Nature's Miracle is habits Miracle his whole being his Miracle how can you be anything else but miracle Hallelujah your new birth is Miracle your new life is Miracle even your nature is a miracle how you can look back and say them things are dead this is right you're a new creature a new creation oh my Paul says therefore If any man be in Christ he is a new creature old things are passed away behold someone say all things Harvey come now you're a Believer the god of Miracles is your father oh my oh this ought to make us believe this I know it's been a little heavy but this ought to make us worship it ought to make us believe the god of Miracles is your father what does that mean to you you're a Believer the Bible says in Mark 16 these signs shall follow them that believe them that the god of Miracles is their father in my name shall they cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover Hallelujah you begin to believe God for Supernatural things because you're a supernatural being with a supernatural birth and now you sit in the house of God and you're not bored no more you're not you're not sitting there thinking about something else but you're that you're tuned into the word of God why because there's something about you that's changed and you realize I'm a child of a supernatural Anything could happen today have you ever walked into the house of God and said today all things are possible today anything is possible today I can receive my healing today my loved ones could come in today could be the day when my body will change and I'll walk out of this body into a new body I'll see my loved ones begin to come back today might be the day when I take that step of faith and go home today might be the day I've heard Matthew calling me all these years and today might be the day when I step into it anything is possible because my God is a supernatural God I will not listen to the critics I will not listen to the naysayers I will not listen to the doubters all things are possible someone say all things this morning all things do you believe it hey man let's stand together and raise our hands amen hey man let's raise our hands to him Hallelujah all things are possible whatever you have need of right now all things are possible if you were not born again you could not understand Heavenly things but this morning you understand Heavenly things because all things are possible all things are possible it's a light striking the seed is it is it nourishing is it growing is the atmosphere growing it listen there was a man named Saul one time but he was born again not by his own will but by the will of God and he became the greatest miracle Hallelujah when God reached down his hand and knocked him off of his high horse put him there in the sand I said now you're going to follow me you're going to be here let's just let's just raise our hands to him and worship Him moment oh God oh how we love you today we believe you are a supernatural God you do not change the world is changing so fast these folks that I preached to some of them

Fly Away there's one announcement I forgot there was a brother Harrison Valance passed away and his funeral is at two o'clock on Tuesday I believe at Christian Tabernacle so be in prayer for the valance family if you would I completely forgot to mention that and just remember them in your prayers and and believe the visitations at one o'clock at the church and then two o'clock is a funeral so just keep the family in your prayers if you would let's sing it again just as we go now well I Fly Away o Glory I will fly away that way I Rise Hallelujah bye bye don't fly away so there's just a few more weary days [Music] where Joy shall never end I Gonna Fly Away [Music] with us [Music] thank you
