Believers have gathered here on this Friday afternoon lord it's a different day than we would normally gather but Lord we know that you're the same on Friday as you are on Sunday or Wednesday Lord You're the Living God and you're the god that is above all and you're in all and Lord you're working through us here tonight and Lord As We Gather here I know there's many needs in the congregation

condition in her body I pray oh God Lord that you would send strength into her body right now father Lord as I was just reading your Prophet as I heard that pray request we spoke of a heart being touched and strength coming into a life I pray Lord that you would go right to her right now Lord and may you drive that cancer out of her body and Lord may you strengthen every fiber of her being Lord that she could raise up off of that bed of Affliction Lord is a testimony of your power now Lord as we come to this portion of the service we invite you may you come in this meeting have your way among us tonight God lord I pray that you would anoint every believer here tonight Lord may you drive every Spirit out of the building that's unlike the Holy Spirit father May lives be touched May Hearts be changed and we'll be sure to give thee all the praise all the honor and all the glory and the wonderful name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we pray and all the Believers says amen amen and amen if you have your Bibles tonight we want to go to the Book of Luke the 24th chapter The Book of Luke the 24th chapter Amen brother Joel something's changed in this it's not hardly working so if I could get some more volume in my ear would be great amen Luke 24 in verse 49 amen you all uh amen that's good it sounds better amen Luke 2449 I know you all are very familiar with that scripture amen you love the Lord tonight amen Luke 24 in verse 49 Jesus here said behold I send the promise of my father upon you but te ye in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high now I want to say this we're not here tonight tearing the power has already been given tear ye in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high I believe that's the Holy Spirit don't you I believe that's the spiritual power that ues a church now in the book of 1 Timothy the 3 chapter 1 Timothy 3 and verse number 15 I want to read one scripture there in 1 Timothy chapter 3 and verse number 15 Paul here uh writing to Timothy he says now if I T long that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God I love this next word he uses which is the Church of the Living God Amen so we're not the Church of a dead God but we are the Church of the Living God the pillar and ground of the the truth amen the church is the pillar and the ground of the truth we ask Lord this evening to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can have your seats here this afternoon amen we thank the Lord for the reading of the word of God Amen uh from those verses of scripture tonight if the Lord would help me I want to speak to you for just a few moments on this thought the powerful Church of the Living God Amen the powerful Church of the Living God you know I I believe tonight that we're not just a church I don't believe we're just members of a building or we're here just gathered amen but I believe we're a powerful force I believe we're a powerful group of people I believe amen that we are the powerful Church of the Living God now maybe just to draw this thought from a quote brother BR says in 1957 he said what does it take to make a Christian Life he said now if the Church of the Living God which is the pillar of the truth so the Church of the Living God is the pillar of the truth he said God intended this church to be a powerful church amen God intended this church to be a powerful church he said a glorious Church a church that the whole world Amen could look upon as a bride of Christ well expected amen espoused and to live in such an atmosphere and to conduct itself in such a way that God would be proud of this church to present it to Christ amen at the coming of the lord it's should live Amen in the characteristic in the church it should be living that way amen so this is not a dead church this is not amen a gathering of a bunch of dead Believers but this is a church amen where the power of God has found a right away and he's able to express his characteristic of power now enticing Spirits brother said I am positive sure this morning amen that if men and women could only get in the position of where their soul and their thinking and their attitudes amen would be perfect in the sight of God he said that would be one of the most powerful churches amen that ever existed amen if we could get our souls and our thinking and our attitude amen perfect in the sight of God Amen then that would be one of the most powerful churches that ever existed amen again now amen just to lay a foundation here in Luke 24:49 amen from the Amplified Bible it said listen carefully amen I am sending the promise of my father the Holy Spirit upon you but you are to remain in the city of Jerusalem until you are clothed amen or fully equipped with the power from on high amen so in other words they was in a they were in a naked condition amen but when the power came the power would be more than a feeling it would be more than a sensation but it would actually become the dress wearer amen that the church was supposed to wear again the emphatic diag I love this translation amen behold I send forth the promise of my father upon you amen but remain you in the city until you are invested amen with power from on high so in other words this power is not just clothing the church amen but it is investing in the church amen and that word power is dunamis which is where we get the word Dynamite from amen so we would not be cold in icicles amen but we would be cold with dunamus amen which would be power which would be the authority of God coming in the church amen that word power is strength it is ability amen it is inherent power it is power that is residing in a thing amen by virtue of its nature it is or which a person or thing exerts and puts forth amen it is the power for performing Miracles it is moral power and Excellence of the Soul it is the power and influence which belongs to riches and wealth it is power and resources amen arising from numbers I love this one it is power amen consisting in or resting upon armies amen or forces then do you realize tonight that you're not just a church amen but you are an army am and you are a force now I say this I believe I'm speaking to a prophetic class of people amen because the Book of Joel is a prophetic book right amen and Joel prophesied in the last days amen that there would be a great Army that would raise up amen and it would be an army that would not be ashamed amen because the Vats would be full amen the oil would be overrunning church amen we're not gathered here tonight amen ashamed of who we are ashamed of what we believe ashamed of what we're going through amen we know who we are we know where we come from we know where we're standing and the power of God is resting upon the church amen I believe it I believe that you are the liberated people who have liberated by the power of God that has been equipped in you and invested in you I believe it I believe when the Bible said amen Jesus was very specific he said I behold I Sinn amen the promise of my father upon you I love that word sin it means to order one to go to a place amen appointed that he may be Amen in a state of liberty so in other words the promise of the father amen was not bringing more bondage on the church but the promise of the father was bringing Liberty in the church amen that for the first time the church amen could manifest the full potentials that they was brought up the Earth to manifest that's why Jesus said amen you shall receive power amen after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and you shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria unto the uttermost parts of the earth now I know the Holy Ghost has been SC alized the Holy Ghost has been ridiculed the Holy Ghost has been belittled and put out of some Churches amen but I want to stand here tonight and say I am a firm believer amen that the holy ghost is real the Holy Ghost is power the Holy Ghost is fire amen the Holy Ghost is Deliverance amen I am still one of those act two Holy Ghost still Believers that Mees the Holy Ghost amen can fix any situation it can heal any sickness it can deliver any bondage it can save any soul I don't know what your habits are and your addictions are I didn't come there to gather all those together I come to say the Holy Ghost can break the addiction the Holy Ghost can break the habits the Holy Ghost can save the soul the Holy Ghost can heal the heart I believe in the baptism of the Holy Ghost coming in the church in the power and dynamics that it was sent to amen if we know what the Holy Ghost is then we know what the Holy Ghost is not brother Cody if we know what the Holy Ghost is and we know what it's not amen and I'll tell you what the prophet said he said the Holy Ghost is the spirit of Jesus Christ in you the Holy Ghost is the spirit of Jesus Christ in you can I say it like this the Holy Ghost is the power of God that sent you amen into the heart as a witness of the spirit amen you are born again and your life is cleaned up the world is dead all the stink of it amen is like the garlic in Egypt seed you're far away from it you're a new creature in Christ Jesus all things have passed away you together have become a new creation and you are born of the spirit yes sir amen your whole members of your body is submissive to his spirit and you're moving in the Holy Ghost and you're not listening to the sound of the world oh Church of the Living God Amen I think that's c m right there amen that there is a people on the Earth tonight who has died to the gods of leosa they have died to the gods of America and they have been resurrected by the baptism of the Holy Ghost they're a new creation they're a new creature amen they don't have ears for anything amen but what the spirit has to say unto the church amen I'll say this the Holy Ghost is not power from the bishop it's not power from the church it's not power from a big preacher the Holy Ghost is the power of God from on high it's not a handshake it's not a letter amen it's not a group amen it's a gift of God with power from on high to demonstrate the resurrection of the one who is sended into the Earth I love what the prophet says he said the holy spirit is an experience it is an experience of being filled and endued with power for service and I say this you're not sitting here tonight amen full of a dead experience you are not sitting here tonight amen with a secondhand experience but if you have got the same holy ghost that they received on the day of Pentecost amen you have got the literal life of Jesus Christ in your soul and it is moving you it is leading you it is controlling you believe I believe we have received a true experience amen by true power amen now you all know that I'm a firm believer and God sending a prophet amen and that prophet's word amen being an absolute to the generation that it's sent into and the prophet said the true word amen comes to the true prophet and he tells you the true word then you follow the true word and you get an experience a true experience of the word and then the true Prophet comes with the true word and you receive that true word and you receive an experience of that true word amen then that true word becomes a power in you he said because the word is made flesh in you and you got God in you amen the word revolving out of you because you are his nature his spirit is in you and you'll do the works of God Amen how many Believers have we got here tonight amen that if you are a Believer amen then Mark 16 is not in a grave it is in flesh tonight if you are a Believer John 14 is not just reserved for a prophet it is revealed in the bride if you are a Believer tonight amen then God is under obligation Amen to give you the power to perform the promise for the age you're living in now brother said if you believe God and say you believe God and haven't received the Holy Ghost then there's something wrong with your faith and I'm just going to preach a little bit tonight cuz I think it's time to get the Holy Ghost I think it's time to bring back the Holy Ghost to the pulit I think it's time to bring it back to our young people we have we have robbed our young people amen of knowing that the Holy Ghost has the ability Amen to deliver them for pornography to deliver our marriages to deliver our families but I think it's high time that somebody remember that there's a Holy Ghost and he's got a power and he's got an authority and he has the ability to change the situation I believe in the Holy ghost I don't believe in Psychology I believe in the Holy Ghost and I believe what the prophet said he said God is under obligation to give every believer that repents amen and is baptized he is under obligation to give you the baptism of the Holy Spirit you say brother Andrew I have repented I have been baptized but I have not received the Holy Ghost well can I say this amen don't you let the devil move into that area in your life and begin to interpret whether you should have it or not come on don't you let the devil move in that little area and begin to say well you've been repented and you've been baptized amen but maybe the Holy Ghost is not for you amen that devil is a liar the prophet of God said that God is more willing to give the Holy Ghost then you're willing to receive it now come on either the prophet's right or he's wrong and I believe he's right he said he's more willing to give it to you than you are to receive it amen see God's under obligation to keep his word now let's just stop here for a second and say a lot of times people are praying for a ref a refilling or a receiving of the Holy Ghost and they bypass to repentance and I tell you why the prophet of God Amen breaks this down so beautiful he says that a man cannot lay in the presence of God and a church cannot stay in the presence of God Amen under repentance unless the Holy Spirit comes down church if you want to bring the holy ghost in a meeting amen start repenting and making things right and cleaning out the ditches and cleaning out the channel oh come onen I know what I'm talking about some people don't think we need to repent no more amen but I still believe in a good oldfashioned repentance come on church amen if we got so revelated we can't even repent no more have we got so self-righteous that we can't even say God I felt wrong I said wrong I looked at something wrong amen I tell you what we're praying for Revival and we're binding the spirit of Revival by unconfessed sin and unrepented things but if we would open our hearts tonight and let a coal of fire come up off the altar amen and touch the lips of the servant it would Chang us from an unclean condition and bring us into a position with God and he could unlock the windows of heaven and he could fill every empty vessel he could seal every Empty Soul he could change every heart amen repentance then brings the holy ghost in the building and gives unction and power to start a move of God in there when you begin to repent God begins to sin Hallelujah when we begin to confess God begins to forget come on church I'm preaching to you when we begin to forget amen the blessings of God and remember the curses of God we got a problem we've got to forget the Past come on do we believe in the blood or what do we believe in the power of the blood or what I still believe the power of the blood can cleanse a man can sanctify a man and contains a man's future I still believe there's power Brother David Paul I believe there's wonderwork power in the blood of Jesus Christ I believe the blood of Jesus Christ can take a drunk and make a holy ghost filled man I believe the Holy Ghost can take a sinner and make a son or daughter of God out of him blood has got power church amen and the power of the blood is the spirit of God flowing through that blood Satan hates the preaching of repentance amen I'll tell you what the devil does when when you start preaching about repentance the devil starts trying to lock the atmosphere up and tighten things up you know why because the Bible said there were two preachers that begin to preach repentance and when they begin to preach repentance the devil come after him you know who it was it was Paul and John the Baptist amen when Paul preach repentance the devil said kill him when John the Baptist preached repentance they said put his head on a platter I'll tell you the reason why amen the devil does not want repentance amen preached in the church brother said because when you thoroughly repent and believe on the Lord and are baptized in the name of Jesus Christ you make God a liar if you don't receive the Holy [Applause] Ghost well I would try to shut that repentance up amen but I want to tell you tonight that my God is not a liar my God is not a liar have I got any acts to Believers that can witness you've been Sanctified you've repented you've been baptized amen and you got the Holy Ghost amen how many's got the Holy Ghost amen if you got the Holy Ghost raise your hands and let the world know I've got the Holy Ghost and if you ain't got the Holy Ghost it's a good night to receive the Holy Ghost if you ain't got the S of God upon your soul it's a good night to receive it God is not a man neither is he the son of man that he should lie amen or he should repent amen he has said it and shall he not do it he has spoken it and shall he not make it good he said these words if you repent of your sins amen and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ you shall receive amen the gift of the Holy Ghost brother Tom that wasn't just good for the day of cost that wasn't just good for 161 PES amen but that promise is good here tonight I know we may be at the end of the Gentile ages amen but the same God that give the holy ghost in the beginning the alpha has become the Omega and he still gives the Holy Ghost and he still fills lies and he still fills Hearts amen I declare to you tonight amen that power belongs to God power belongs to God David said in 6211 he said God has spoken once and twice have I heard this amen that power belongeth under God and 1st Chronicles 29:12 he said both riches and honor come of thee and thou reignest over all and in thy hand is power and might and in thy hand is to make great and to give strength unto all Second Chronicles 258 he said but if th will go do it be strong for the battle amen for God shall make thee fall before the enemy amen for God hath power to help and to cast down I love job 26:12 he said he divideth the sea with his power and by his understanding amen he smiteth through the Prout Oh Glory to God Amen then when you see the sea are y'all hearing me then when you see the Atlantic Sea and you see the Pacific Ocean amen and you see them border right next to each other and brother Jeff they ain't Crossing and there ain't a bunch of confusion amen you know why because the god of creation amen said by my power I will separate the sea I will separate the mountains Church of the Living God if he can separate the Atlantic from the Pacific that he can separate you from sin he can separate you from the world he can separate you from unbelief I'm talking about a God who has the power to come on the scene and separate a life and fill that life with the very life of his own life he has the power to do it amen I love Psalm 656 which by his strength he Seth fast the mountains are y'all ready for this amen being guarded with his power them mountains out there have been set fast sister Vicki by the hand of God and what is giring them mountains is the power of God all right you know what that word gir means it means to equip it means to clothe and what did Jesus say he said you shall receive clothing you shall receive power and the same power that holds the mountains is the same power that clothes the bride my goodness the same power that separate the sea is the same power that separates the bride amen from bab and confusion the same power Church brother said it's the father who takes care of it he said who's got any more power than God can I can I can I give a challenge here tonight Who's got more power than God who has got more power than God it's an open challenge who's got more power than God let's let a prophet answer it he said what kind of power have you got amen over you to take care of you he are you ready for this some of y'all right now are a nervous wreck it's election year the econom is crashing all these things are happening how these troubles and problems how are we going to make it out amen but the same power he said that created the universe is the same power has taken care of you who's got more power than God what kind of power have you got over you to take care of you the whole powers that created the universe Church you're a powerful Church the powers that created the universe is watching over you come on Mama quit worrying about them babies he created the mountains he separated the Seas he has the power to rescue the prodical he has the power to restore those that have been taken away I'm not talking about a weak old old grandpa I'm talking about Jesus I'm talking about Elohim I'm talking about the God who stepped out on nothing and by a display of his power created everything well y'all just give me some shout room here tonight I'm talking about the powerful Church of the Living God she's not on a pillar of emotion she's not on a pillar of sensation she's not on the pillar of feelings she is on the pillar of truth it's the truth that the power of God can deliver Hallelujah said the members of this virgin bride will love him and they will have his potentials for he is their head are y'all ready for this and all power belongs to him they are subject to him as the members of our body is subject to our heads now do you realize the Propet said that God's power is not to be made a show God does not make his power a show in other words God displaces power through the characteristic of himself now in Hebrews 1:1 the Bible said God who had sun right times in diverse maners spake in time passed unto the fathers by the prophets I love these words half in these last days half in these last days days amen spoken unto us by his son whom Heth appointed heir of All Things by whom also he made the worlds who being in the brightness of his glory Hebrews 1:3 who being in the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person and upholding All Things by the word of his power somebody say that with me by the word of his power amen now watch this when he had by himself purged our sins he sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on High brother picks this up in the Hebrew series chapter one he said the brightness of whose Glory God's glory the express image of whose presence God's he said Express image of his person and upholding all things amen by the word there you are the word that upholds all things see Jesus said that heavens and earth will pass away amen but my word shall never pass away watch this he upholds all things see science tries to tie it down and say it's an old book it's been translated amen even the Roman Catholic Church Bishop Sheen said that it's been translated four or five different times and there's not much to it you see you couldn't live by it if you had to but he upholds all things by his word that's what I think about it he says I believe the Bible amen the word of his power he said there's power in the word I'm going to preach to you amen there's not power in your feelings there's not power in my emotions there's not power in our sensation but there is power in the word as a matter of fact heavens and earth will pass away amen but my word shall never pass away now I'm just going to preach to you for a second amen because if that power comes into you it'll move you from a weak confession to a strong confession of Hebrews the third chapter if the word of his power ever becomes the power of your life it'll transform you amen from where you are to where God has ordained you to be listen Church there's Potentials in you amen there's power in you there's Authority in you and the devil's tried to tear it down Leia's tried to tear it down amen but I believe God and God's word said they shall walk and not get weary they shall run and not paint I'm preaching to you I'm identifying to you where your support is coming from it's coming from the power of God let me say this to you amen little church you're not waiting to be equipped you're fully equipped come on I'm not looking at a church that's waiting to be equipped my Prophet tells me we are fully equipped amen can I say this amen God wants to use some of you all he wants to use you he wants to use your life he wants to use your testimony amen but you let the devil so beat that down well I can't be used because of this and that but can I say this amen God God does not call the equipped all right God does not call the equipped but he will equip the called that's the promise of the father you stay there until God equips you with the baptism of the spirit then everything you've got need of in this world or the world to come amen is living right in you if you got the Holy Ghost everything that you have need of in this world world or the world to come is living right in you can I say this to you the god that WOTE a word amen has come down by the Divine revealer of Malachi 4 amen and he is invested amen with power from on high Amen to move you from being the girlfriend to move you from being the from being the fiance Amen to move you into being the Bride of Jesus Christ now can I prove it to you when brother preaches the seals he says these words tomorrow night by the grace of God breach he says we try to break that first seal if God will break it for us and let us see what this Revelation has been it's been hid from the foundation of the world he said but before we do that sinner friend or lukewarm church member do you just have a membership in a church or do you not have a membership if you have only a membership you'd be pretty near well off without it you need a birth you must come to the blood you must come to something that just the sin away till there's no more remembrance of it oh God whatever Revelation was coming out from under those seals had the power to not only forgive the bride but to justify the bride and the prophet announces that we don't just have a covering but Brother Bruce we have a bleach amen and it's a bleach of the blood come on and the prophet of God said the bleach of this blood is going to track that sin amen all the way back to the head of the devil that caused you to do it in the first place let me say this sin shall not have dominion over this powerful Church unbelief shall not have dominion over this powerful Church come on church I'm talking about the blood can I go ahead and say it condemnation shall not have dominion over this powerful Church guilt shall not have shall not have dominion over this powerful church he did not save you to put you under the chains of condemnation he did not deliver you to make you live under the fear and the guilt and the down days of your past but he who the son has made free is free indeed I say it to you by the authority of the word of almighty God you're the sinless you're the Spotless You're The Virtuous bride of Jesus Christ it's as though you never even done it in the first place see if you haven't made preparation yet to meet that lamb in the air then watch a Prophet by the power invested me by the power invested me by my commission given by almighty God and ministered to me by an Angel a pillar of light I charge you in the name of Jesus Christ don't you try to meet him with only a membership of a lodge or a church of this Earth come while the mediator as far as I know he's still on the throne he's making intercession because there will come a day when you want to come and there'll be no mediator can I give that devil a black eye right now come on well brother Andrew if there was Grace I would come if there was Mercy I would come what loning devil crawled up out of the pits of hell and told you there was no Merc mercy and there was no Grace amen I believe there's still a mediator on the throne tonight who has the ability to forgive sin he has the ability to forget iniquity and remember them no more forever hallelu now I'm this close to it I might as well preach it was a devil that invaded this message and some wise man got the idea that Mercy was over and there's no more grace and there's no more blood but you know what amazes me brother Ben is Mercy's over to their family needs it well come on we might as well preach anden Grace is over till somebody in their little circle amen needs some mercy or Grace amen but let me just goad knock that devil while Square in the face amen if there's enough Mercy for your family there's enough Mercy for the Bride of Jesus Christ if there's enough Grace for some man's idea there's enough Grace for every name that's on the Lamb's Book of Life I believe it I believe he said we've seen the hour we're living in the seven Church age and the mysteries of God become what they have with the Vindicated spirit of God showing everything that he promised in the last days now can I say this how many how many's ever been to a wedding you've been to wedding you you most of you married people here amen you remember amen when the preacher stepped back and said these words he said by the power invested in me by the state of Arkansas I Now pronounce you husband wife you know what he's doing he's referring Amen to the legal Authority he's been given to join two and make them one in other words he's already give a space for somebody to contend this union he has stopped and said if anybody sees any reason why these two should not be lawfully joined together then let them speak now or forever hold their peace I can preach it to you by Rahab do you realize Rahab was a harlot but when she got under the to token she left the life of harlotry and married a general in the army of God she married a general in the army of God y'all imagine rahab's wedding ceremony and that preacher had to stop and say does anybody have any reason amen why these two should not be married and Rahab stand there real nervous because the whole Community knew what she was the whole town knew where she was but I can hear Joshua stand there and say Rahab don't you worry when those walls fail every accuser you had when those walls fail every accuser you had was crushed beneath those walls and you have been liberated oh Church of the Living God there's another Joshua and is coming this generation through the opening of Seven Seals and has married the bride to Christ and he stood back and said is there any reason why that Christ and this bride should not be married and you was nervous and I was nervous but then we remember there was a blood and the blood had drowned all of our accusers the blood had destroyed all of our sin now you can marry this new anointed word by the power invested in me I'll say this to you there's a marriage taking place on the earth there is a marriage taking place on the earth and there's a marriage supper the lamb going to be served in the skies now can I just go ahead and preach to you if the devil could stop your marriage he can't stop your reception no y'all didn't hear that if the devil could stop your marriage he won't stop your reception if the devil couldn't stop you from marrying this new anointed word he will not stop you from from changing bodies some morning between 6: and 9 and stepping from time into eternity and this corruptible will put on incorruption and this Mortal will take on immortality and then will be brought to pass the same that death is swallowed up in Victory well devil you lose again I said devil you lose again I think we ought to shout that devil back to the hell that he come out of devil you lose [Applause] again he couldn't stop your wedding come on can't stop your reception because you're controlled by the power of the Living God now what's a prophet there's only two powers in the universe today he said that's God's power and Satan's power that's right he said every war every disorder everything that comes along is either controlled by God's power or Satan's power see because there's only two Powers there is that is the power of life and the power of death can I say this now Satan has got his power he's got it see but it's the perverted power of God it's no real power it's a perversion of God's power everything Satan has is a perversion he said so we are today sitting here and one or the other Powers is going to control us now can I say this thanks be to God that God promised brother Dave he would restore the real power to the church in other words the prophet said I will restore sayth the Lord all the years now watch a prophet's interpretation I'll send back another church in the last days I will restore that original Power again in the evening time it shall now be light so in other words the same power that was shining in the alpha went down in the Dark Ages but would be restored in the end time and the same power would be shining again in the last day church as it was in the first day can I prove it to you he said there's been so much mockery in every phase of religion but there's a real power of the holy spirit that delivers the human being from the bondage of sin there's a real power of the holy spirit that delivers the sufferer from his suffering the devil brother Jeff contended with every Power on the face of the Earth until a prophet made a declaration that the Sun that sets in the west amen that rise in the west sets in the East and he made an announcement it is it is the rising of the sun now watch a prophet I'm so sick and tired of human philosophy I want to see the real power of God demonstr straight and move among his people where that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever proving himself that's what the world is hungering for it may get tight here for a second amen but put on your seat belt we're going to get through iten are we going to shut the door in the face of the restoration of the original Power of God because some fanaticism has rose up around it are we going to slam the door in the face of the movement of the Holy Ghost because somebody done this or somebody went this far with it I think it's time to open up the door and let the original Power come back in the church with the same signs with the same wonders with the same Miracles with the same man come on church I think it's time to let the Son of God arise in the church again now I won't back up to that day amen because I tell you what we're worried about we're too worried about fanaticism come on we're too worried about fanaticism as if if there's any fanaticism there was no real at all come on y'all know I'm telling the truth amen so now we got shout police in church and we got praise police you know they kind of sit back there when somebody starts shouting well they try to qualify their shout if somebody breaks out and starts praising God well I might as well preach on here anyhow amen somebody starts praising God we get some old praise police raise up and say now don't go too far amen don't go too far well what about the one it went far enough come on we're try come on Church we're trying to draw a line and say you can only go this so far without it being fanaticism well I pray ask you what would you have done when brother brandom stood behind the pull pit and he put his leg over the pull pit and dangled his leg from the pull pit well sister sh well I'm this close to it am but I believe we got a witness of the power of God Amen sitting right here in this building tonight I remember a few days ago there in Oklahoma amen the power of God got a hold of that lady amen and without anybody with her she was outside the building shouting and rejoicing and praising God now come on some old devil would like to say that's fanaticism but it depends on who it's happening to well give me some shout R it depends on who it's happening to if it's happening to a cold formal church member it's fanaticism but if it's happening to one of those acts to sons of God that have receed the Holy Ghost it's a refreshing from the presence of God and we ought to welcome the moving of the Holy Ghost back in our churches well brother you're going to go too far why don't we go far enough real power of the resurrected Christ amen you say you're getting way out there am I though the real power is the Pentecostal blessing so are we going to rob our young people of the Pentecostal blessing because of something that happened in 1906 well I might as well preach I'm here are we going to quit preaching the real because of the false are we going to quit preaching the real because of the false I tell you what happened amen if somebody got too far out there and I I just go ahead and say this it's on the internet so God bless you amen the way to fix all this confusion is come back back and say I'm wrong and the message is right it'll fix all of it we'll have preachers quit fighting from one p pull pit to another oh come on somebody amen one man correcting this man and that man correcting this man why don't we get back to preaching the message and let the message come in the church have you forgot the prophet said the it's a dangerous spot I got a sword have you forgot the prophet said the word corrects the eror so are we going to quit preaching the word because of the eror I say we ought to preach the word until the word corrects the error and we repent of the thing and get right with God and let the church move on for the glory of [Applause] God sir I know what I'm talking about I'm not I'm not a shishy or a h and I'm a preacher too many cowards trying to correct things and ain't got the guts to stand with what a prophet said so they get up and say well I'm going to call this and I'm going to call that amen why don't you just get back to saying what a prophet said and quit confusing the seat of God oh come on cuz you got one man shooting at one man across the country and that man even fing the bullets the ones feeling the bullets is the poor people sitting between them and the other guy and so they're trying to kill something 10 states away and killing the seat of God in the house of God put the gun off of your brother put the gun off your sister and put the gun back on the dev and bring an atmosphere in the church and'll save our babies it'll heal our sick it'll raise our dead that'll deliver our bond bring back the power of the Holy Ghost by the [Applause] preaching come on well brother Andrew I'm called to correct the bride you're called to preach the message [Applause] yes get in trouble but I'm going preach here for a second we've let too many personalities invade the pull pit instead of preachers when I've been around and I've seen and I've dealt with we thank God for all your experience but the headship to this body is the message of the [Applause] hour and if we get back in the tapes come on church I know what I'm talk about we got young people around this message it's been 10 months of Sunday since they heard the prophet but they're called up on every preacher and hey glory to God you know what it is it's a spirit of Lea where it's too hard to listen to a tape so we got to listen to some man I believe in streaming and I thank God for it amen but can we make our homes dedicated to the tapes [Applause] again brother B I'm just going to preach if that's okay cuz what happens is is you get up nothing against it but you get a bunch of people listen to one man and the way he preaches something and the way he teaches his church then they come in Ben's church and when Ben teaches it the way the prophet teach it they say well that's not the way brother so and so teaches it so then you put brother so and so in the message in a battle Amen on who's right amen but we can escape a lot of this nonsense if we would get back to saying the takes are right and the prophet is right and the message is right and everything else is wrong I don't care how I teach it Ben teaches it brother Sean teach or any other preacher teaches it if it's contrary to what a prophet Tau you fold it away and stand with a word of his power that's been Vindicated and made manifest in this generation we're not going to overcome wrong with wrong we're not going to over become false Doctrine with more false Doctrine I'm talking about the powerful church if that's okay we've let the world's understanding of what power is come in and invade our lives and literally Rob us of the truth of what power is can I take some Liberty here Pro to God said how could Satan say that man could be God speaking of Jesus a man that could take the challenge of a priest right and let a drunken Soldier spit in his face today we got the wrong conception of what power is ready for this power is overcoming oh yeah Power is overcoming returning good for evil that's real power now come on church if we're going to be sons of God manifested Messiah then let's say what a prophet said and he said according to Joel 2 in the last days there would be a restor of the real power in the True Church of God In the End Time and here a prophet says that real power is returning good for evil that you can love your enemy and do good to those that do evil to you that's real power oh brother getting pretty close ain't it David Paul that's real power that's God's power yes sir Maniacs can break chains but it takes a real man to return good for evil from his heart not because of religious duty but from his heart come on Church who said that the return of real power would be the restoration of God's power it was Malachi 4 who said in the days that the heart would turn to God the veil would be taken off do now now do we want to preach or we want to go home do we want to manifest the real power of God do we want to be a powerful church or do we want to be another fighting Church another arguing come on Church do we want to be another bunch of people 30 years down the road still fighting about something taught 50 years ago I say it's time to manifest the original Power of the Holy Ghost through the Forgiveness of God now I tell you what the Bible said the Bible said that Jesus was the son of God and a prophet said the devil said how could that man who was hanging on the cross be God has it ever dawned on you Brother David when he was hanging there he wasn't fighting with those on the ground I'm preaching to you he wasn't arguing with those on the ground he wasn't arguing with the Pharisees and shooting at the Sadducees and fussing with the Roman soldiers that was spitting in his beard but these are the words he said he said father father forgive them for they know not what [Applause] do now can we go ahead and let the rubber hit the road and preach a second that's your example brother Ben that's our example amen that Jesus hung on a cross and he manifested the power of God which is the original Power which is the real power and the way he manifested it was not pulling the nails out of his hands or taking the Thorns off of his head or or or holding putting a cover over his ribbon side but the way he manifested the power was through these words father oh yeah father forgive them for they know not what they do I know where I'm at right now father forgive them for they know not what they do in other words the same power that manifested in the head is going to manifest in the body come on now if you're returning evil for evil you're not manifesting in the original Power come on now if you're returning evil for evil you're not manifesting the powerful Church of the Living God on the Pillar of Truth you're manifesting a perverted power and anybody can do that on now I'm going to say it like the prophet said he said now watch from the pulpit I spoke a mighty scientist not long ago he said what he said here he said brother brandom there was a meter put on a Dy Saint can I preach a minute and when they were dying it slipped off in a room and her knowing nothing about it when her death struck her she wasn't afraid see she lifted up her eyes and now watch what she done when death struck her she lifted up her eyes and asked God to forgive every enemy she had she's laying on her deathbed brother Sean but there's to be a church with a restoration of the real power and here is a member of the body manifesting what the head did that day on Calvary she said father forgive every enemy I have and she thanked him for her life as she lived and when that meter was put on zero there was enough power raised from that woman Supernatural something that went from her that called onto that meter made out of the same thing as a lie detector that's your nerves he said now watch there was enough power that was coming from that woman to send a radio message around the world five times I believe it was amen of power coming off of that Dy woman he said go on beyond the moon the stars to the throne of God with that prayer of a sinner's poor heart in the hours of her death when she was laying on her death bed she wasn't fighting with her enemies she wasn't shooting at her adversaries she was laying there as a manifested display of the restoration of the original Power of God and she cried these words she said father forgive them can I tell you what the prophet said he said the re he said the perverted power it won't manifest like that he said there was a man laying there an Infidel dying with a veneral disease sent a young lady in there to get him all emotionally worked up then when he got angry with her begin to curse and take God's name in vain and the meter turned back as far as the other way as the Christian did this way he said what is it the the scientist said if God respects people who use his name in The Glorious way and believe him that much I now believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and accept him as a savior are you all hear what I'm talking about that's the power of this message a woman laying on a deathbed with an unconverted scientist could manifest the life of Jesus Christ and say father forgive him and an old Infidel laying there amen could Curse God and the scientist was converted are you hearing me well I'm going to say it it's time to get back to forgiving again I said it's time to get back to forgiving again and letting some things [Applause] go I said it's time to get back to forgiving again and letting some things go you're going to hold on to it and hold on to it till you're sub bitter oh come on I might as well plow into it I'm this close to it amen but I refuse to let the devil amen Crown my life when an old crabbed Spirit of [Applause] bitterness now I know what I'm talking about cuz I got some Elders in here right now and are pulling my guts out you know why I can say that because they've been through enough that they should be hard they should be bitter they should be evil they should be contous they should be mean but somewhere or another brother Joel they come in contact with the original Power of the Holy Ghost and it didn't just cause him to dance it didn't just cause to shout but it caused them to forgive and let the love of God come back in their life again brother and you getting way out there am I really am I really brother said watch he said those lights around the Savior and around the Saints was not just some mental conception he said it was God now this is the scientist oh God I wish I could break this down the way I'm seeing this was the scientist yeah come on brother Judah who's just seen this woman forgive and this man die cursing God and he stands between them and he he learns that God is more than a religion but he's a power he's a supernatural power and he surrenders his life to Jesus Christ now watch what he says he said he testified to brother brandom he said the power that was coming off of that woman was the same power that was around the brass serpent in the days of Israel amen oh yeah are you y'all hearing me the same power that was that was coming off that was radiating off of her was the same power brother Danny that was around the brass serpent brother B said I asked him what about the pillar of fire he said yes sir he said the only problem is they didn't have a camera back then to catch what they've caught now are y'all hearing me then that tells me that the pillar of fire is more than a decoration it's more than a picture but whatever you see in that light is is the same Radiance of power that was around the brass serpent in the days y'all got that picture have y'all got that picture the pillar of fire can you put it up there for me amen amen that picture is more than just a wall picture it's more than just a memorial it is a reflection that the original power of God has returned to the church and a prophet has brought it down so narrow to say your attitude towards that picture can determine your outcome I know what I'm talking about amen because there was a man a Baptist preacher he said he walked in one day and he saw the picture if you can't find it it's okay I know you're familiar with it here but he walked in seen the picture brother Joe the prophet of God said he just kind of snubbed in his heart a little bit and made a little laugh said that man blasphemed he blasphemed sealed his eternal Doom he said and went against God but Brother David Paul there was little one woman who was laying on her deathbed and the doctor said she was going to die of cancer and they brought that picture in the room Oh Glory to God they brought that picture in the room and Brother Bruce when they put that picture up the prophet of God said she looked at that picture and she said that's our Lord up there he said instantly she was healed of cancer and got up off of that [Applause] [Music] bed are y'all hearing me this is more than just a happy go-lucky message church this is the mechanics becoming the Dynamics in the age we're living in come on I I'm persuaded of better things of you I'm persuaded that there's some messiah in here I'm persuaded that there's some people you've been hurt you've been lied on you've been scandalized you've been criticized but you got enough of the power of God in your soul that you can shake it off and say father forgive them come on good father forgive them I got that devil on the run right now I might as well run him on back to Hell father forgive [Music] them come on well they hurt me Father for well they said father for for they know not what they do are you hearing me can I say this I've seen that quote in manifestation in this age on I have seen the power of God I'm going to just preach I'm here it's in the room I have seen the power of God come in and deliver a person from unforgiveness want me to tell you about it over a meeting in Indiana a few years ago right around after covid and there was late a little girl come up in the prayer line in that camp and sister Vicki these were her words she said brother Andrew she said said I lost my grandmother and I lost my grandfather to co she said and I know who give it to my grandmother he she said and they knowingly knew they had it and they gave it to her and she died from it these were her words brother Sean she said I hate them and I could never forgive them they took my grandmother from me now those are some powerful words I hate and I can never forgive and brother Jeff right there in that prayer line I said oh God what can I say to help this young girl and brother Joe is real as I'm talking to you it was almost like something just broke and I could literally almost see the Lord hanging on Calvary it was not a vision it was just something I could just see him hanging there and I heard these words in the back of my mind father forgive them oh on I said sister I said do you want to manifest God or do you want to manifest the human nature and broken down she said I want to manifest God I said okay one day your lord hung on the cross 2,000 years ago and he hung there and he looked in the face of the ones that put him there and he didn't scandalize them he didn't Bel them I said these were his words he said father forgive them for they know not what they do I said now sister do you believe you're a Christian she said I am I said I'm going to put you in the same position as your Lord did I want you to bring this person before you and what are you going to say and brother Joe with these eyes I watch the supernatural power of the the holy ghost strick that young girl and she said these words she said father forgive them I'm talking about the Holy Ghost I'm talking about the power of God that can come in a meeting and destroy the Devil of bitterness he can destroy the Devil of unforgiveness and I want to say this he's in this building tonight he's in this building tonight he's in this building tonight thank you Lord come on yes sir I'm not a crazy man Brother David Paul I seen it with these eyes and then I walked from her and I went over to another young girl she said these words she said brother Ander I was abused as a child I was hurt by a family member she said I Harbor feelings against him she said I cannot forgive him oh my is this okay brother Ben I cannot forgive him I said sister you're in a good meeting tonight she kind of looked at me funny brother Tim I said you're in a good meeting she said what do you mean I said do you see that young lady over there with her hands up and the tears streaming down her face rejoicing in her Freedom she said yes I said you know what just happened to her she said what I said she couldn't forgive amen but she was able to forgive because the supernatural power of the Holy Ghost come over her life and she's forgiven the individual brother Sean I watched it I watched the same anointing strike that girl and she be to say say God you're the Healer I forgive him I forgive him are y'all hearing me I'm talking about a powerful church I'm talking about a church where unforgiveness can't stay I'm talking about a church where fears and complexes and this would hurt me and that would hurt me it cannot stay this is not the pillar for unforgiveness this is not the pillar for bitterness this is the house of God and it's the Church of the Living God I say open up the windows of Heaven tonight and release the forgiving Spirit of almighty God upon the church we got to let some things go we got to let some things go we are not a cold formal intellectual church we are a powerful church and our power is coming from the ability to manifest God in the age we're living in now I'm way out there but I'll say this in closing you want to manifest the power of God you gotta let some things go come on all right you got to let some things go that's good that's well she said and he said and they conspired but you got to let it go on can I tell you what unforgiveness is like unforgiveness is like drinking poison hope and it kills the person that hurt you all right right I know we ain't shout but devils are backing up right now unforgiveness is like drinking poison and hoping is killing the person that hurt you come on it's the truth do we believe in the power of God do we believe the power of God can still fix things what about it Hardy do we believe the power of God can still fix things do we believe the power of God can still forget the past and forgive the Past come on we're one Church we're one body with one motive and one objective and that is the message of the Hour come on our babies need to know that we can forgive come on I'm preaching to you now and I know the devil don't like it but I'm going to keep saying it because if we're not careful we're going to get so resentful we're going to get so resentful and you know what'll happen you'll have your kids mad at people they don't even know you'll have your kids won't even listen to preachers they don't even know because 30 years ago he did this and she I'm after that devil and I ain't going to back up till I kill him but it's time time to let it go I said it's time to let it go it's time to let the influence of the Holy Ghost come back in the church in the power of the Dynamics of the reality of God yes sir good I know what you're saying you're s brother Ander I can't do it well the prophet of God said until that church becomes both mechanics and Dynamics and the spirit of God that moved in him to do the things that he did yeah yes sir all right come on I know we preach about the spirit moving in him to heal the sick but can we preach about the same Spirit moving in him to forgive those that hurt him come on now brother Jeff will read this quote and Shout our shoe heels off if he hit on 16 cylinders so with the bride and I believe that but he didn't just hit him on Miracles he hit him on character he hit him on love see John 14:12 he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also amen I'm going to say this right now or I'm going to bust I believe the works of God is in this building right now to charge you to break the backbone of that devil and bring your life of Liberty like you never had it's all over you amen it's all over the building tonight let it go that the power of the Holy Ghost send a charge of the Dy into the mechanics and release you from the fame Satan iure thee in the name of Jesus Christ take your hands off of God's children and release them release them for the glory of God you can't change it you can't redo it but you can move on you can't go back and change it but you can let it go and move on oh Hallelujah you can let let it go you can let it go right now you can let it go right now I fight Devils but I'm going say it anyhow you can let it go right now you can literally let it go right now and the power of God can release your family it can release your faith it can release your joy it can release your nature I'm talking about a God who has the ability to move in you and release some things so you can get some power back you want the power back in your church you want the power back in your home forgive your husband you want the power of God back in your marriage forgive your wife and let it go come on yes sir that's good you saider why'd you

building Church he's here he's here he's here prophet God said you can scream and shout and jump up and down all you want to but deny this word it won't do any good you're just cranking around on the Pistons got the spark there to fire but no gasoline to fire it by it'll only work as they come together so one will sit still and the other will go up that's the only thing there is to it yes both alike both claim to be churches both claim to be bride but one has mechanics and Dynamics and it brings it to pass of what he has said is the truth when the Dynamics come and the fire is made to connect with the octane and the gasoline when that explodes it causes a combustion and that combustion moves every motion every move for he is the same yesterday today and forever that's the resurrection that's the real power of God mechanics with the Dynamics it's the spark that fires not the gas that fires it's the spark that fires the gas said brother Andrew why did you read that because I invite the spark of the Holy Ghost to strike the gas [Music] you know I'm talking about brother Ben that anointing that moves in the ministry of the word invite that spark to move the gas tonight cause a combustion you can let it go tonight oh thank you you let it go tonight heavenly father have your way among us tonight in Jesus Christ's name in Jesus name we pray [Music] amen amen

a problem with somebody and you don't go to 10 people to tell them the problem you go the person you got the problem [Music] with just preaching a little bit here tonight you said brother I ain't got an issue W talk this out and you know what you do you break the Devil's Backbone that's right amen get mad at me if you want to gossiping has become one of the greatest [Music] hindrances to Fellowship in this age we're living in so everybody talking everybody but if we get some good oldfashioned Christian Courage said brother let's talk about this and break the Devil's Backbone I know you thought I was preaching about a powerful church and I am but I'm preaching about manifesting the power of God through the nature of God by the baptism of the Holy Ghost y'all remember brother Braham talked about the angel of the Lord come to him and told Brother Neville he said brother Neville he said you know he said the angel of the Lord told him he said brother Neville he come to me and told me that all this Discerning and things that's going on he said you're he said you're hitting some he said but you're going to miss eventually and he said the angel come to me and told me to tell you stop it and brother Neville listened to him and moved on you know what brother Neville didn't hear that from he didn't hear that from 10 churches or 10 other preachers wasn't talking about it and then it got to brother Neville brother BR went right to him and broke the spirit and they moved on now either we're the Church of the Living God on the pillar of truth or we're not I think it's time
