[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] is the best thing [Music] in his arms never disconnected [Music] his arms i feel protected there's no place [Music] i mean just looking forward to what god has in store for us amen we just got a just a little thought on our heart this evening but hey man i was maybe gonna sing a song but sincerely you know i'll be all right i'm just kidding hey man and they didn't want to hear me sing anymore after this morning so but appreciate the specials and everything this evening but uh this uh this afternoon i just like to just preach a very simple thought i don't know really who it's for but i just couldn't get away from it but we'll turn to john chapter nine and um this is something that's always always stuck with me it's um something i studied really really early on and um and maybe for the young people going back to school or you know it's it's amazing sometimes when you when you try to do do something for god or god does something for you rather it's amazing how it's almost immediately persecution begins to follow amen you know and sometimes it's you do something you know god god leads you a certain way and you do exactly what what god wants you to do and next thing you know you're met with persecution and many times it's often sometimes friendly fire um you know so so whoever this is for and we're just gonna do a little bible study tonight so it may be a little different normally than what i'm what i'm used to but but we'll just pray that god will just touch us this evening but john chapter nine and verse one and and as jesus passed by he saw a man which was blind from his birth and his disciples asked him saying master who did sin this man or his parents that he was born blind and jesus answered neither hath this man sin nor his parents but the works of god should be made manifest in him so so with that we'll just bow our heads this uh this evening maybe if you have an unspoken request if you just want to make that known amen and also remember sister sister gene and brother robert and the family there i believe brother ben's with him now but let's just say a special prayer for them as well dear lord we just come before you this this evening just just expecting to hear from you or we know that lord that if you don't come lord that this this gathering together lord not that it would be pointless but lord that we don't want it to be in vain lord because our main purpose today is just to hear from you and and to just commune with you and god you see the needs that were mentioned lord during service and this morning and those that are unspoken this afternoon and and for sister gene and brother robert and them as they are as they're around her this evening god we just pray you would send them a special touch and lord that is the word would go forth lord these unspoken requests and those that are sick lord that that as the word would come forth it would go and it would discern the thoughts and intents and and hearts of the people lord that you would meet those needs tonight and god we pray lord you just move me aside and come and speak to your children that whatever would be said lord that would just glorify you lord that none of my thoughts or ideas would be interjected but it would all just be your word in jesus christ's name we pray amen amen you can have your seats and and so i will i will give you the definition of this word manifest it means plain open it's clearly visible to the eye and it's obvious to the understanding so we see that here in verse 1 as jesus passed by he saw a man that was blind from his birth and his disciples asked him saying master who did sin this man or his parents that he was born blind and and a lot of us brother branham talks about this occasionally he says you know he says a lot of people associate sin with or associate things going wrong or sickness or or things going wrong in somebody's life with sin and he says many times that's not the case and he talks about even brother branham talks about the time whenever he had the accident with a gun or what it was and he said you know people attribute that to sin in his life and and so you see many times that just because somebody's going through a difficult time or going through a hardship it doesn't mean that there's sin there but you know that god's actually doing something in their life and and you know i read a quote one time a man said he asked god for strength and god gave him struggles because he can't be strong without fighting is that right you know we can't sit back and say well god i want you to give me this and expect god to just give you the outcome of that situation but he's got to give you the trials to go through to make you strong is that right now and jesus answered neither this man's sin nor his parents but that the works of god might be made manifest in him and so we see that these works of god that word manifest it's clear it's visible it's very obvious so to speak so we see that this man was blind from birth simply so that the works of god could be very visible in his life very very clear to the understanding and jesus goes on and says in verse four he says i must work i must work the works of him that has sent me while it is day the night cometh when no man can work he said as long as i am in the world i am the light of the world he said and when he is when he had thus spoken he sped on the ground and made the clay of spittle and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with clay and he said unto him go and wash in the pool of shalom which is interpretation sent and he went forth therefore and washed and came seen so we see that that god that jesus came here and he gave the he gave the direction that this man should go he gave the word the the as our pastor preached this morning no faith cometh by hearing this man heard the word that was given to him and then he obeyed the word is that right so it's not it's not just good enough that we can hear the word it's not good enough that we can just be in the presence of of a minister or of a prophet or the tapes but we've actually got to do what those things say is that right we've got to actually bring it into action so if i was to tell my to tell my children to go and do something it's good that they heard that and maybe they even listened and understood it and could comprehend it but until they go and actually fulfill what i said they actually did not they did not actually do it it was not manifested until that's done and so we see dealing with kind of the young people tonight or this that's where my thoughts going with the young people going back to school and i was just kind of thinking on that and thinking about when i was in high school and all the things that i battled and i just couldn't imagine what the the children of today battled and and you know uh you know i went through high school without the holy ghost and it was just ups and downs ups and downs back and forth and and you know as i was looking at this you know the main thing is to is to be filled with the holy ghost amen i believe if you're going to fight the battle of this day or fight in this age you've got to have him on your side is that right now i can tell you this i haven't done everything right and don't don't pertain to but but i hope tonight this will just bless you a little bit because once you're filled with the holy ghost one thing i realize is cause that's when the battle really starts now it's a different type of battle and it's uh you know for young people you begin to fight different things in different ways and but we see that the outcome is for the works of god to be manifested in our lives is that right i believe as christians it's our desire to manifest what god has his will for our life it's our desire to manifest that for him if he wants us to be a minister if he wants us to be a singer if he wants us to be a lay member whatever he would have us to be a sunday school teacher if he'd want us to be the janitor at the church if he'd be want us to be the one that gets here early and blows off the sidewalks whatever god wants us to be we've got to be that is that right and and so i wanted to kind of show the young people a little bit you know how important position is right you know it's very important whenever you've heard you've heard brother branham tell the story of when a kid gets out on the road and and you know the pair doesn't just say well hey little johnny come out of the road if there's a car coming they begin to scream they begin to do everything that that's possible and so it's very important that we stay in position is that right yes all right so it's important if i get out of position at work i'm a lender and if i just decide tomorrow that i should just open checking accounts then the bank's going to go in a different term because i'm doing something that i'm not supposed to do is that right if you know if if i tried to pastor that would be a very bad thing everybody would leave you know that's not my position that's not my calling and so we've got to understand as ministers we got to stay in our lane as lay members we've got to stay in our lane as young people we've got to stay in our lane and it's where god leads it's not where man leads us is that right and and so you know to to see you know i wanted to kind of show with a show show the young people what it's like to be in position and i've done this before but i want the musicians to come up again whoever was playing before service but i want you to move one instrument to the left actually that won't work with the piano and the organist so you get on the bass you can get on the organ you get on the piano stuart you get on the organ where's allison all right and so the important of being in position is our our musicians here are really really good you all agree y'all agree yeah you get on the piano you get on the violin stuart let's hear that so turn on your instruments all right and so now now young people you can be in the right location right the right vicinity the right church the right youth group everything but if you're out of position it's not going to go very well is that right all right if if me and joel decide tomorrow we're going to go do our own thing we're going to we're going to we're going to jump in on this we're going to tell everybody this is what we're doing this is what's going to happen it'll go to pieces if god doesn't guide you if you don't stay where god is leading you it's going to throw everything else off so we've got all these musicians are very good they can all play instruments we know that we've heard them but that doesn't mean that they can play anything they want to play right we're going to turn you on to make sure it's really really good so we're going to sing ain't got good and we're going to see how everybody does all right key of g even though none of y'all probably know which one that is make sure we get stuart very loud on this ain't got good to give us so many blessings undeserving that's what we are see it's terrible even if you've got one in the right spot right you've got one that actually knows what they're doing on that instrument if three other ones are off it doesn't work so if we were to actually put someone else on the right and now all y'all get to your right instruments if you if you don't mind and so when one person maybe we've got the pastors in the right lane but the whole church is just out of chaos and in all kinds of sorts and we're fussing we're fighting with each other well how's the church ever supposed to go anywhere right if one of us gets out of line and so we have to see how important it is for all of us to be in our right position when we come to church it's important that we come in the right attitude right right brother ben said i could let y'all off easy tonight so i'm trying my best you if you just correspond with me we'll be in and out of here but if we come in the wrong spirit it can throw off the atmosphere of the church is that right we know that we know that brother branham brother branham showed us that he he taught us that we know that that's that's the way the spirit of god works any little thing can throw that off is that right now we've got everybody in the position now we can sing ain't got good oh ain't got good to give us so many blessings undeserving that's what we are we ought to thank him love and praise him a little more today and a whole lot more tomorrow so give give them a hand clapper y'all can go now but you see how important it is for us to be in position and so this blind man what always amazed me is is how as soon as he begins to do what god told him to do that's when the opposition actually come and at that time it came from other church folks so to speak i won't say christians but it come from other people now we see that god or jesus tells this man exactly what to do tells him where to go tells him what to do when he gets there and he told him that when he gets done doing that he would see and so this man he does this he comes back seen and so we see that the neighbors therefore we're going to go on down to verse 8 the neighbors therefore and they which before had seen him that he was blind said it is not he that he said is not this he that set and begged and so look at them and they're like is this not the guy who used to sit at the gate and beg is this not him and some said this is he and others said he is like him but then we noticed the the the man said no he said i am he i'm the one that used to sit at the gate and beg and and so young people there's going to come a time where you've got to speak up and say hey this is me you know i was the one i once was blind but now i see i once was dead but now i live and and so you see there's going to come a time where you've got to testify about what god has done in your life and and so and it said it said therefore said they unto him how were thine eyes opened and you know it's it's funny when you when you when you you have someone who comes into the house of god and and and you know maybe they've had a rough past or a rough a rough upbringing or whatever they've done maybe they've been in and out of church but we always want them to know this is a safe harbor to come back to right this is a rock that they can run to and i think it's important that we that we we let our young people know that that if you leave here and you're full of the holy ghost we know that you're going to be okay right is that right we know that whenever we send our children out as we prayed over everybody this morning going back to school we know that god is going to watch over them he's going to protect them but i think you know we've got to make a point too that you know that this is the place if you if someone's not full of the holy ghost if somebody goes out we need to let them know that they need to come back to this place amen we need to let them know that we're not going to we are going to we we want to see the fruits of the spirit is that right we want to we want to see young people save but if you go out and make a mistake don't think that everybody here hates you is that right not everybody in the message is hating you or or things like that but we want you to come back and make it right is that right and he answered and said a man that has called jesus made clay and anointed my eyes and said go to the pool of siloam and wash i went and washed and received sight so he tells the people here he says you know i was given the word of the lord i obeyed the word of the lord and the word of the lord actually healed my eyes and i come back seeing amen now brother branham says in the token he says and when we can display the token of the holy spirit he said it shows that we've been accepted in christ and that is our token that all we have need of is already purchased by him do you believe that so everything that we have need of for this journey has already been purchased says we are identified with our token he said the token must be ready the blood the covenant blood is not recognized without the token he said the word assures us of the promise the token is the sign of the purchase has been made for us he said full obedience to the word of god entitles us to the token he says no other way is there that you could ever be entitled to the token until you fully obey the word he said not what somebody has put into it or added to it but what god said about it and i love this someone said you know when you when you accept that ticket not only does it show where you're going but it also shows that you accepted the price that was paid for that ticket so it's not only showing you where you're going but you fully accepted the price that it cost for that ticket now john in john chapter 14 says here it says he that hath my commandments and keepeth him he is it that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and i will love him and will manifest myself to him and so that word if we remember correctly in the beginning it makes him visible to us it makes it makes us understand who christ is is that right and that's what the holy ghost does you know you look at what brother branham did as a restoration prophet when he come it wasn't that he was bringing new things in but he tied all the loose ends together and it was through that that you and i that revelation was able to come and you and i could see who we were in this word is that right said he that loveth me shall be loved to my father i will love him and i will manifest myself to him and it says judas said unto him not iscariot lord how will how is it that thou will manifest thyself unto us and not unto the world and he said jesus answered and said unto him if a man love me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our abode with him he that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings and the word which you hear is not mine but the father which has sent me now when judas asked this question how is it that thou will manifest thyselves on thyself unto us jesus didn't actually say what i'm going to do to show that i'm manifested he actually said this is what the believers gonna do when they understand when they see that i've been manifested to them and so he said if a man love me and will keep my words and keep my commandments so we know that the people who are who are going to church and saying they love god and they're doing this and they're worshiping in vain if they do not keep his commandments and follow his word we know that god has not been manifested christ has not been manifested to those people so we see we must keep his commandments for him to be manifested in our lives and brother branham in 1955 in the curtain of time he says that's the thing tonight he said quit arguing religions could argue in different phases and arguing different church denominations and different nations and the world needs to know tonight that jesus has risen from the dead and said that he lives among men he says amen not to argue about this or pinpoint this or cut this out or move this and inspired this and just forget he says look up to him and believe he was raised from the dead and he will manifest himself to you and that's what we want is jesus to manifest himself to us is that right he said amen he said it's just that simple he says well if an angel was preaching that he said no no he said god didn't ordain angels to preach the gospel he ordained men to preach the gospel he never said to angels i'll be with you and in you he said to men i'll be with you and in you he never said to angels he said the things that i do you'll also do but he said to men the things that i do you'll also do he says the gospel comes of the preaching of the word of god he said god will manifest himself through human beings so we see that you know god is going to manifest himself to this age somehow is that right he goes on and he says the only eyes god has got on the earth tonight is mine and yours the only hands he has is our hands he said god is working in his people god is in the universe and god is in his word he said god is in his son and god is in his people so we see that the only way that god can work in this day is through you and i is that right that you and i would be the actual people the actual bride that is going to manifest christ to the world and show that we do serve a living god is that right i quoted it the other day when i think after song service but you know they they went through and looked at some of the quotes before some of the great prophets died and just through history and and you know i think um uh i think it was buddha that said peace is the way or love is the way and then another one said you know peace is the way and and confucius actually said you know i am not the way and i do not know the way and then but jesus christ come and said i am the way and so we know that when jesus was here we know that that was the way to get to god is that right you know it was the second adam that come was not gonna we weren't gonna be like the first adam it wasn't gonna be like the first eve but he was gonna have a bride that was not gonna fall to satan is that right now john chapter 15 and verse 7 it says if you abide in me and my words in you you shall ask what ye will and it shall be done unto you so we see we must obey his word do you love the lord this evening and then we're going to kind of jump back into this this john chapter 9 real quick and we'll pick up at verse 12 and and so we see that when they had then they said unto him where is he and he said i know not so the people are coming and saying where's this jesus that healed you right and so they're coming back to him and they they brought the pharisees to him that aforetime was blind and and it was that the sabbath day when jesus made the clay and opened his eyes and then again the pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight and said unto them he put clay upon my eyes and i washed and do see and and so you see it's very fun to me funny to me that the religion of that day began to question you know how did you receive your sight they weren't rejoicing that he received his sight they wanted to know you know how did this happen and therefore had said some of the pharisees this man is not of god because he keepeth not the sabbath day and then others said how can a man that is a sinner do such miracles and there was division among them and so they began to decide you know was you know jesus can't be of he he can't be of god or god made flesh because we know that he can't do this on the sabbath day this is just not right and and so they begin to argue amongst himself because a sinner should not be able to open the eyes of a blind man and they begin to argue a little bit as we heard brother branham say we don't need to argue over the little things but they begin to do that and and they said unto the blind man again what sayest thou of him and young people that are going back to school it's always amazed me that that even if even if you're trying to hide you know many times in my in my christian experience maybe i wouldn't bring up god to anybody i wouldn't bring up the message to anybody i wouldn't bring up the bible but somehow people know that you're a little bit different and and they will begin to ask what do you say about this and and you can't help it if there's if there's a seed on the inside you're going to be questioned at some point what do you say about this and it's going to happen so i think the best way to do is just be prepared to answer that question amen and i believe as a christian you won't be caught off guard you'll exactly know what to say of him and and so this blind man he said he they said what sayest thou of him that that hath opened thine eyes and he said he is a prophet and so we see that the blind man said well he he was a prophet that's that's what i know about him and and that's that's that's just what i know him but the jews did not believe concerning him that he had been blind and received his side until they called the parents of him that have received his sight so they begin to not believe the blind man right he testified told a little bit about what he knew and told told a little bit about what he thought about jesus and they're like you know what we're really not going to believe you till we actually see your parents we want to know that you were blind and so they asked them saying is this your son who you say was born blind how how then doth he see and his parents answered them and said we know that this is our son and that he was born blind but by what means he now seeth we know not or what hath opened his eyes we know not he is of age ask him he shall speak for himself and i want you to know there comes a time when when mom and dad can't get you out of trouble right there's going to come a time when when mom and dad's going to say you know i'm taking my hands away from this this is your life this is what you're going to do and and we see that when that time comes it's going to come back to you as an individual it's going to come back to you what do you say and what's amazing to me is these people were not going to leave this alone and that's the way the devil is he is not going to leave it alone until you give answer amen he's going to trace you down and chase you down until you give answer he's going to constantly try to see whose side you're on is that right he said these words spake his parents because they feared the jews and so i love this part because the his parents were a little on the religious side right and he says for the jews had agreed already that if any man did confess that he was christ he should be put out of the synagogue so they were like well we don't want to get kicked out of church so we're just going to stay out of this let our son handle it he's a big boy he can do it and and there said therefore said his parents he is of age ask him and then again they called the man that was blind and said unto him give god praise we know that this man is a sinner so they come up to him and they're saying listen we know you've testified we know you've done this but we want you to give god praise because we know that that jesus is not of god we want you to we want you to testify of what we want to see and so he answered and said whether he be a sinner or no i know not but the one thing i know wherein i was blind now i see so he's testifying he's like i i can't answer these questions and i can't do this or i can't do that but one thing i know is that when i met him i was changed after i met him and so i want you to know we may not always be able to give the correct answer or this or quote this or quote that but you know when you walk away from him you know you've been changed amen you know that you've been different since the day that you've met him now he answered and said whether he be a sinner i don't know that but where and i was blind now i see and they said unto him again what did he to thee how opened he thine eyes and he answered them and he said i told you already and you did not hear wherefore would you hear it again will he will ye also be his disciples so he's saying you know why do you keep are you asking me so that you can follow him too are you asking me so that you can know him in the way that i know him then they reviled him and said thou art his disciple but we are moses disciple and i don't know if you remember here a few weeks ago brother ben was preaching about about the children of israel coming up to the promised land and and they come up to the promised land and they were going to send spies over right you know the story and they sent the spies over there were 12 spies and and they come back and they give an evil report 10 of them gave an evil report of the land do you remember that the first time i think he was ministering the first time i ever realized that moses selected those men that was the first time i ever realized that moses had selected those men i just thought they were just they were heads of the tribes or whatnot and they were the men that were supposed to go and and so you know i began to think on that a little bit and begin to think you know it really doesn't matter who men picks it doesn't matter you know if moses picked these men to go over and the children of israel should have went to the promised land but they come back and gave a bad report and what i realized is is people under the prophet that maybe were even close to him or around him may not have the same vision that the prophet had the the men that he sent over didn't have the same vision that moses had or didn't have the same vision that joshua or caleb had or and so we see that just because they're picked by men doesn't mean that they were picked by god is that right you know i i could fall tomorrow maybe brother ben would pick another minister you know another minister would come in and he could fall tomorrow or jewel or anybody could fall tomorrow but as it doesn't change the vision that god has it may change the vision that you and i have i may pick someone tomorrow and they may fall and go by the way but that but but god knows it the end from the beginning he knows exactly what's going to happen and you know i began to look at this as i was studying on this because i just couldn't get away from it it was amazing to me you know how how brother ben was preaching on jonah and the well and or jonah and the fish rather and he talked about god preparing a fish to swallow jonah and so you know you think god was just preparing jonah and all this but he was actually preparing a fish to take jonah to nineveh god was not called out of swords he didn't have to create at the last second of fish to do this the fish god already knew what jonah was going to do and then you know i began to look at that and begin to look at this here and i began to think about esther and so while i was in the back i just went and read the book and and you know god was preparing to save a people and so before haman ever come along he put esther in position to save the jews is that right so we we know that haman was coming he was on his way but god was going to find a way to save his people and so we see here that god is always going to find a way to bring out his will maybe it's you know you understand perfect will and permissive will but god is always going to find a way to bring out his will and it's going to come to pass we know that that god cannot be defeated he's never been defeated down through history and he's not in the losing business now he's not going to be defeated in this age for sure so we know that god's will is going to come to pass and so these men they say well we we're moses's disciples you know we're we're we're a little bit better than you you're jesus is but we're moses disciples and and so we see brother branham says in 1950 i just found this quote and he says now remember if you can just take just for a moment maybe there's some of you do not understand he said frankly friends there's much of it that i don't understand but i just accept it he says he says don't ever try to figure god out he said you can't do it he said god is not understood by knowledge god is understood by faith is that right we heard about that this morning he says what if peter would have tried to figure out how deep the water was and how impossible it was for him to walk on water he said he would have never walked on water he said see says and he says but just look at christ and he said he just took christ and his word and walked out there he says well that's the way i did this and i just took him at his word he says and there i went he says you just take him at his word tonight and he says if you may be a sinner and do not understand how to take god at his word he says then god sent me here he said i want you to take my word for it and see if it doesn't come to pass that god will bless you so he's saying you understand god by faith because you know there's no way to explain how people have been healed from cancer is that right there's no way to see how people have been healed from from from lust or been delivered from drugs and delivered from these things there's no scientific way to nail that down but when you trust god and believe and understand him in faith you'll take that leap is that right knowing that he's going to catch you on the other side amen do you love the lord this evening amen i know this is very simple it's a sunday school lesson but stay with me we're almost we're almost done i know the kids are like we already had sunday school but here it is again amen and i really do i've really really been praying for the kids going back to school and you know just a father of three you know i was kind of like you know this is okay and then we go to the school the other day with jen for parent-teacher conference like man maybe this is not okay you know so you know we just we but we trust the lord to take care of him is that right amen so he answered them said i've told you already and you did not hear wherefore would you hear it again and also be his disciples they reviled him and said thou art his disciple but we are moses's disciple i mean that's the nicest thing they said about him was that he was jesus disciple that's the only good thing they say about him this whole scripture he said we know that god spake unto moses and as for this fellow we know not from whence he is it says the man answered and said unto them why hearing is a marvelous thing that ye know not from whence he is and yet he hath opened my eyes he said now we know that god here is not sinners but if any man be a worshiper of god he doth his will and he heareth he said since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind he said if this man were not of god he could do nothing they answered and said unto him altogether born in sins and thus thou teach us and they cast him out and you'll find that when the devil doesn't have an answer for you they'll just get rid of you when they don't have an answer for you they just they'll just say get out and and jesus heard that they had cast him out and when he had found him he said unto him dost thou believe on the son of god and i think this is one of the the the scriptures the verses that has done the most for me uh in in my christian walk was was once he was cast out you immediately see jesus come on the scene and so any time that man does away with us or man gets rid of us jesus is there to pick us up is that right i believe that's all down through our christian walk if you look down through the scripture and you see when men of god fell in the bible or maybe went the wrong way there was god to pick them back up and get them on the straight path again is that right now god's not gonna come over and just say it's okay i'm just gonna you can keep doing this it's all right no god's gonna tell you what you need to do to get back right with him and then you've got to do it is that right he answered and said he says do thou believe on the son of god he answered and said who is he lord that i might believe on him and jesus said unto him thou hast both seen him and it is he that talketh with thee and he said lord i believe and he worshipped him so we see this young man's life was changed drastically but nobody was giving him problems until god began to work in his life and and young people and old people alike you can testify of this but when god begins to do something in your life that's when the devil begins to move in and tries to bother you tries to do things to you but i want you to know there is a rock that you can run to amen there's a rock there's a there's a savior there's a tie post that you can go to that will be there when man is gone when your mom is gone when your family's gone your wife is gone there is a tie post that will be there that will hold you in any storm do you believe that this evening now we see here that i'm just going to kind of bring this down to a close here in a few minutes but joshua and caleb they were obeying the word of god knowing that the promised land was theirs no matter the size of the giants on the other side and and this is just another quick example of when brother ben was preaching about moses picking the spies but but joshua and caleb and these 10 other spies were going to this land that they knew was rightfully theirs they were going with their with their fellow believers their fellow uh their fellow uh the soldiers that they'd been fighting with walking through in the desert they were going over there but i want you to know not everybody's gonna have the same vision not everybody's gonna have the same path the same life but all i know is that if you follow christ he will lead you you look and you see caleb and joshua did the right thing is that right you see they went to the promised land they come back and they gave a good report and said we are more than able to take the land but you see the 10 other spies outweighed them and they held them back and the children of israel were not able to go in at that time because of the report that was given but i want you to realize joshua and caleb didn't quit at that time just because the others weren't going through they stood with god and and as the others perished as they all died in the wilderness joshua and caleb god was able to stay with them until the end to bring them to the promised land because they knew that god had promised it and knew that he was faithful to bring them through so you can see that when everybody else may halt the plan of god if you will stay in line with god he will bring you where you ought to be you believe that this evening joshua 1 and 7 it says the only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which moses my servant commanded thee said turn not from it to the right hand or the left that thou mayest prosper wither ever so thou art whithersoever thou goest he said the book of the law shall not depart out thou out of thy mouth he said but thou shalt meditate therein day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein and for them thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then thou shalt have good success he said have not i commanded thee be strong and of a good courage be not afraid neither be thou dismayed for the lord thy god is with thee wither so ever thou goest so we see how does god manifest himself through a believer it's by us hearing the word and by faith receiving that word and acting upon that word and following it through to the end you know we see many times in our christian walk you know we have ups and downs we have ebbs and flows we have this and that but if we stick with the word of god we know that god will lead us we know that god will lead us where we ought to be you know many times the journey may look hard if you look at the story of abraham and isaac he was the promised son but then he told abraham go and sacrifice your promised son and so it may not have been clear to abraham but abraham by faith followed the word of god is that right and what happened god provided him a sacrifice he provided a ram in the thicket god provided himself a sacrifice second corinthians chapter four we'll just read this real quick he says we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed always bearing about the body of the dying of the lord jesus that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our body for we which live are always delivered unto death for jesus sake that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh so as believers our desire is for us to be the literal fl or to be the flesh that jesus is manifested to in this day that we're going to be different than the first eve is that right we're not going to fall to satan's life we're going to be overcomers we're not going to barely get by laodicea but we're going to overcome laodicea amen we're taking a rapture out of laodicea do you love the lord this evening brother branham says in the invisible union in 65 he says if i was supposed to die in the morning and a man took my place he said i cannot die for that sin he said someone took my place he said in jesus the word took my place he become me that a sinner that i might become him he said the word amen he said let me hold true to it not the church but the word he said oh that spiritual union and i want to stop right there when we hold true to the word god will lead us where we should go is that right when we hold true to the word god will show us exactly where we need to be we won't be wondering and saying well is this where i need to be is this what i need to be doing no when we follow the word of god it will lead us where we need to be god is not a god of chaos he does not say well i'm just going to let the people figure it out no he's going to lead you through the holy spirit to let you know where you ought to be and what position you ought to be in he said he said oh that spiritual union of christ and his church now when the flesh is becoming word and the word is becoming flesh manifested vindicated he said just what the bible said would happen in this day he said it's happening day by day do you believe that he said we say we've got to obey the word and god will manifest himself through us now i want to read this quote and then we'll kind of we'll kind of bring it to a close this is from 1955 it's the great warrior david and he said don't leave this building tonight without having the holy spirit cut away the old blind shackle that stands there he says throw the thing away so say i believe god walk out of here like a man or a woman a child of god with a victory and the morning star leading you marching you under glory says the devil raised up and said well i thought i had you he said say i told you i had you bound he said look at here you remember me i was the person that was up there i was the person sitting here and the doctor said i couldn't live but a few more days longer and here i am yet tonight he said hallelujah says then somebody say you know if she can do it i can too he said so i'll trust him he says amen you don't know what what's the matter tonight he says oh you don't know how the holy spirit likes to get into a bunch of people like this now he said if you could only realize where you're at only realize not say in this building but you're in christ so we've got to realize where we're at in this day it's not that we're in the message of the hour or we're not we're not doing we're under a certain church or we go to a certain church or we run with a certain group but we've got to realize as every believer in every church in the messages got to realize that we're in christ not that we're in anything else but we're in christ he says positionally everything is yours all yours it belongs to you he says do you now believe so we see that once we positionally place ourselves or once we're positionally placed in jesus christ we are not we are not servants we are no longer slaves but we are joint heirs with jesus christ so everything that he was entitled to you and i are now entitled to through the blood through that redemption through that through that atonement you and i are responsible or you and i are given everything that christ was given do you believe that so i say to you this evening if you're out of position maybe you're out just a little bit get back in line because the church will go further the bride will go further you will go further when you get in position with jesus christ wherever god god is trying to place you get there and stay there and follow his word you've got to obey the word you've got to hear the word obey the word and then god will manifest himself through your life do you believe that do you love the lord this evening i mean we appreciate god coming and speaking to us this evening and we'll go ahead and have the musicians come at this time as we're going to just change the order of the service over but but i will say this to the young people you know as many times you know we we want to paint the picture that that you know the the the house of god is no place for sin it's no place for us to condone it and say well you can do anything you want and be here but when you do fall there's a place that you can run to that god will pick you back up amen there's a place that you can go that's just a little bit higher than here but that god will lead you and guide you and he will pick you up i believe the bible says a righteous man falls seven times but we know that we're not supposed to say to stay down but we get up every time is that right that we keep getting up we keep moving on no matter what the devil throws at us we keep getting back up and keep moving forward with jesus i mean if you want to bow your heads they would just play something softly do you know that song i want what you want for me could we could we play that maybe and sing that a few times through hey let's just bow our heads as we just go to the lord in prayer and i haven't heard an update on sister gene but just just be remember that family especially in prayer brother robert just a dear friend of mine he was here when
