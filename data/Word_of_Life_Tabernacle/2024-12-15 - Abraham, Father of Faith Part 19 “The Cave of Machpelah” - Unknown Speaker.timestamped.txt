[26:40] amen thank the
[26:42] Lord just enjoying the song service so
[26:44] much it's good to be in the house of the
[26:46] Lord on a Sunday morning Genesis CH 23
[26:49] and verse 19 Genesis 2319 this will wrap
[26:53] up Lord willing wrap up our series on
[26:56] Abraham we didn't get to everything
[26:58] but I just felt that maybe this morning
[27:01] we'd Clos the loop on this and and we'll
[27:04] revisit Abraham again I'm sure in the
[27:06] future if the Lord terries but I trust
[27:09] it's been a blessing to you Abraham
[27:12] always been a blessing to me because you
[27:14] know when all else fails just
[27:17] believe when things don't look like
[27:19] they're going right and everything's
[27:22] everything's messed up and nothing's
[27:24] right and it feels like you maybe you're
[27:26] getting old and your body's hurting just
[27:28] believe right because if you believe
[27:31] God's word it's his responsibility to
[27:34] bring it to pass aren't you glad for
[27:36] that it's not my responsibility to make
[27:38] it happen it's not yours it's on him
[27:41] that's the way Abraham lived said Lord
[27:43] it's on you I'm so glad that we can do
[27:45] that as well Genesis 23
[27:48] and9 and after
[27:50] this Abraham buried Sarah his wife in
[27:53] the cave the field of MPA before mamry
[27:58] the same as Hebron in the land of
[28:01] Canaan and the field and the cave that
[28:03] is therein were made sure unto Abraham
[28:08] for a possession of a burying place by
[28:11] the sons of Heth pray the Lord would add
[28:14] his Blessing to the word you may be
[28:17] seated we'll have our our Christmas
[28:19] service I'll preach my Christmas sermon
[28:21] next weekend the Lord willing so if you
[28:23] have family or anything that's going to
[28:25] be in town you sure be welcome to come
[28:29] as they always
[28:31] are we know Abraham was a nomad he was a
[28:35] sourer he never owned a home in the land
[28:39] that belonged to him he never tried to
[28:41] build a city he never tried to uh build
[28:45] a house he lived in tents the Bible says
[28:48] by faith he sojourned in the land of
[28:51] promise as in a strange country dwelling
[28:54] in Tabernacles or tents with Isaac and
[28:57] Jacob The Heirs with him of the same
[29:00] promise for he looked so this is why he
[29:03] acted the way that he did he didn't tie
[29:06] himself down too much for the bill
[29:08] because he looked for something he
[29:10] looked for a city which has foundations
[29:14] whose Builder and maker is God that word
[29:17] looked for is expected he expected he he
[29:21] was expecting waiting with eager
[29:24] expectation I wonder if you could say
[29:27] that this morning I'm wait waiting with
[29:28] eager expectation looking for a city
[29:32] that this world has has not seen yet and
[29:36] so he was waiting for a city he looked
[29:39] at the Unseen and and when Romans 8:18
[29:43] Paul tells us to do the same thing he
[29:45] said I reckon that the sufferings of
[29:47] this present time are not worthy to be
[29:50] compared with the glory which shall be
[29:53] revealed in in us he said for the
[29:55] earnest expectation of the the creature
[29:58] waiteth for the manifestation of the
[30:01] sons of God that word waiteth is the
[30:03] same word looked for it's expects that's
[30:07] what we're waiting that's what we're
[30:09] expecting we're expecting the
[30:11] manifestation of the sons of God what
[30:13] was he looking for he was looking
[30:17] specifically for a city with foundations
[30:20] and the Bible tells us that other
[30:22] Foundation can no man lay than that is
[30:25] laid which is Jesus Christ looked for a
[30:28] city in other words that was built by
[30:31] God because Abraham understood that
[30:34] anything built by man can be shaken down
[30:38] anything built by man is temporal
[30:40] anything if you own a vehicle you know
[30:42] that everything no matter how well it's
[30:44] made and how good it smells and how good
[30:47] it looks when it comes off the lot over
[30:49] time it's going to deteriorate is that
[30:51] right over time if you own a home the
[30:54] home is going to fall apart all you have
[30:55] to do is just let it go you don't even
[30:58] have to do anything nothing bad has to
[31:00] happen to it just not fix it and over
[31:02] time it'll deteriorate and it'll fall
[31:04] apart why it's built by man but Abraham
[31:07] looked for a city that was built by God
[31:10] himself oh I'm so glad that we have that
[31:12] kind of a city today that's built by God
[31:15] he said I want a place a home I want
[31:17] some place that I can go to are you with
[31:19] me this morning I want someplace I can
[31:21] go that's got a foundation to it when
[31:24] all the world shakes apart and nothing's
[31:26] going right for me and my my whole world
[31:28] it seems like nothing is is right but
[31:31] yet he said I know there is a city with
[31:33] a sure
[31:34] Foundation he look for that kind of a
[31:37] city and we know that man cities have
[31:40] always been built and laid out and
[31:42] planned by human beings starting with
[31:45] Cain in Genesis 4:17 it says he builded
[31:49] a city and he called the name of the
[31:51] city after the name of his son Enoch and
[31:55] we know that's a type of denomination
[31:57] how know that that's why we are not a
[32:00] denomination because we're not looking
[32:02] for a temporal Kingdom we're not looking
[32:05] we're not building a kingdom we're not
[32:07] building a temporal City and so we're
[32:10] not looking for that we're looking for
[32:12] something Supernatural something
[32:14] something more real than reality come on
[32:17] Church something more real than this
[32:18] world that we're living in something
[32:20] more real than our our sickness there
[32:22] something more real than the pain that
[32:24] we experience so something more real
[32:26] than that amen
[32:28] and Abraham recognizes that and if you
[32:31] ever catch a glimpse of that it'll
[32:33] change your
[32:34] life Abraham
[32:37] recognized that the cities that he had
[32:39] been a part of like er the
[32:41] caldes like Sodom and Gomorrah were
[32:44] built by the effort of man with no sure
[32:48] Foundation because the Bible tells us
[32:50] that everything that can be shaken will
[32:53] be shaken this nation will be shaken and
[32:57] has been Shen shaken and is being
[33:00] shaken we we know that the world around
[33:02] us is falling apart we know that the
[33:05] weather is acting crazy and politics is
[33:08] acting crazy and people are acting crazy
[33:11] but in these times we need to look up
[33:13] and realize what and see what Abraham
[33:15] saw and see it's a city made by God
[33:18] without
[33:19] hands
[33:21] amen so what do you see he saw something
[33:23] that can't be can't be shaken loose and
[33:26] so this morning I want to exort you and
[33:28] encourage you I want you to understand
[33:30] that you got to look Beyond brick and
[33:32] mortar you got to look beyond your job
[33:35] you got to look beyond your house you
[33:36] got to look beyond your car let me see a
[33:38] city with foundations let me see
[33:41] something worth striving for listen if
[33:43] there's something in this world that's
[33:45] worth working for it ought to be the
[33:47] gospel I realize we can't work our way
[33:49] into salvation but if there's something
[33:51] worth doing these things for if there's
[33:53] something worth putting our whole effort
[33:54] into brother Caleb it ought to be the
[33:56] word of God right because that's the
[33:58] city without that that's the way he
[34:00] builds is by the word of God we we know
[34:03] that City's there because of the word of
[34:06] God so there's something worth striving
[34:09] for it's that City see we we get what we
[34:15] expect right you wouldn't invest in it
[34:18] unless you expected a
[34:20] return and you won't make much of an
[34:22] investment if you the more the more
[34:25] cautious you are about the return or the
[34:27] more unsure you are about to return the
[34:29] less investment you make but Abraham put
[34:33] all his uh what is that all his eggs in
[34:36] one
[34:37] basket right he said Lord I believe your
[34:41] word I believe I've been promised to
[34:43] land I've been promised a son and I'm
[34:46] looking for a city so he put all his
[34:48] eggs in one basket he said I'm going to
[34:50] do everything that God requires me to do
[34:55] so we get what we expect and so that's
[34:58] how we endure Affliction patiently
[35:02] because all of us will suffer Affliction
[35:04] all of us will go through
[35:06] things and we know that it affects us it
[35:09] affects our attitude it affects but we
[35:11] we've got to make sure that we put that
[35:14] City first and understand that if we're
[35:16] looking at that City no matter what
[35:18] happens here that there's something
[35:21] better coming in 2 Corinthians 4:17 for
[35:23] our I love the way he frames this light
[35:26] affliction
[35:28] our light Affliction which is but for a
[35:32] moment I love the way Paul puts that he
[35:34] said it's it's light it's it's nothing
[35:38] in comparison and it's momentary it's
[35:41] it's it's you say well I've been going
[35:42] through this for a long time but it's
[35:44] just a bliff on the radar in comparison
[35:46] to what's coming it worketh for us a far
[35:50] more exceeding and eternal weight of
[35:53] Glory he said while we look not at the
[35:55] things which are seen but at the things
[35:59] which are not seen for the things which
[36:02] are seen are temporal but the things
[36:04] which are not seen are Eternal so we
[36:08] need to you know we live in an age of
[36:09] Television we live in an age of internet
[36:11] where we can see things we can we can
[36:14] visualize so our our our imagination is
[36:16] shaped by
[36:18] sight right and and I don't know if any
[36:21] of you have ever listened to oldtime
[36:22] radio or you you ever listened to radio
[36:24] back in the day but back in the day you
[36:27] you got to imagine what it was like
[36:29] right right you got to imagine and I I
[36:32] heard many stories on Unshackled growing
[36:34] up one of my favorite memories is
[36:35] listening to Unshackled on Christian
[36:37] radio growing up because we didn't have
[36:39] a television and so we listen to the
[36:41] radio and I'm and it and it caused me to
[36:43] my imagination you know I could I could
[36:45] build that in whatever way that I wanted
[36:48] to we live in a in a time where you
[36:50] don't really see it then it do didn't
[36:53] happen but but you got to recognize that
[36:55] there's got to be something
[36:58] that you that you can grabb a hold of
[37:00] that you can perceive that you can you
[37:03] you can understand Beyond it's got to be
[37:05] words Beyond sight right because no
[37:08] matter I can put a diagram up here I
[37:10] could show you what the city will be
[37:11] like I could show you what heaven will
[37:13] be like but I it would be wrong that's
[37:16] right right it might be technically
[37:18] right but it wouldn't be the experience
[37:21] of it it wouldn't share the joy of it it
[37:24] wouldn't brother BR said no no words can
[37:26] even describe it even even in that
[37:28] Dimension where he was at in that sixth
[37:30] Dimension he said no there wasn't a word
[37:31] to describe it he says Beyond Sublime no
[37:34] words in the English dictionary so it's
[37:36] got to be something that you can see in
[37:38] your mind if we can say by the mind of
[37:40] the spirit something that you can
[37:42] visualize something you can see beyond
[37:45] what this world is in you've got to be
[37:46] able to see a body that doesn't suffer
[37:48] you've got to be able to see a a place
[37:51] where it's perfect you got to be able to
[37:52] see a place where you could fit in a
[37:55] place where it'll never be awkward
[37:57] anymore a place where there'll never be
[37:59] any any social stigma anymore a place
[38:02] where we're in the
[38:04] majority you realize we've never been in
[38:06] the majority the whole time we've been
[38:08] alive and we've been we were OD ducts
[38:11] when we were young and when we get older
[38:12] we realize why we were Christian we were
[38:15] God we had a seat of God in us and God
[38:16] awakened that seat we got filled with
[38:18] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the
[38:19] world thought well this is an odd duck
[38:21] this is somebody that doesn't fit in
[38:23] we've never fit in down here neither did
[38:25] Abraham he lived his life that way he
[38:27] didn't fit in but we're going to a place
[38:29] you got to be able to see by the eyes of
[38:31] faith and see a place where you don't
[38:33] where you will fit
[38:36] in that's why we do what we do right
[38:39] because our actions are influenced by
[38:41] this other
[38:43] place look Paul says why we look not at
[38:46] the things which are seen but the things
[38:48] which are not seen for the things which
[38:50] are seen are temporal with the things
[38:52] which are not seen or Eternal for we
[38:55] know that if our Earthly house house at
[38:58] 2 Corinthians 51 we know that if our
[39:01] Earthly House of this Tabernacle were
[39:03] dissolved we have a building of God a
[39:08] house not made with hands Eternal in the
[39:14] heavens now watch what he's saying if
[39:16] this tent so you say well Abraham lived
[39:19] in a tent I've got a house but this is a
[39:22] temporary
[39:24] house right a temporary house it is a a
[39:28] tent Paul SS our Earthly House of this
[39:31] tent were dissolved we have a building
[39:35] so look at the contrast not a tent but a
[39:39] building not something that rots
[39:41] something that can rip something that
[39:42] can tear you ever stayed in a tent at
[39:45] night yeah a lot of you have you went
[39:48] camping right you go camping in a tent
[39:51] maybe all rich people got RVs but we
[39:53] always did tent camping
[39:57] we we we camped in tents and I remember
[39:59] one time I took Britney and it was just
[40:01] us you know and we're going to go
[40:02] camping we went up by somewhere miles
[40:04] out from Ava Missouri out in the middle
[40:06] of nowhere and there's no lights and
[40:07] there's no and we're not we're not
[40:09] really uh we're not really nature people
[40:12] we we're uh City people in a lot of ways
[40:15] I was born I was raised on the farm but
[40:17] we didn't go camping for fun you know
[40:19] it's not something you would necessarily
[40:20] do but only a few times but I said we're
[40:22] to go camping we went way out in the
[40:24] middle I'll never forget all night long
[40:26] she asked me she said what's that
[40:30] noise we're in the middle of nowhere she
[40:34] said why why why are they making that
[40:35] noise it's the
[40:37] Forest right not to pick up my wife and
[40:40] she I was up all night long we have
[40:43] never done that
[40:44] again we've camped since but only in
[40:47] campsites where there's people
[40:50] nearby but we were 10 miles from nothing
[40:53] out there around Ava Missour beautiful
[40:55] place beautiful country but we were way
[40:57] away from anything listen that's what
[40:59] it's like camping in this
[41:01] tent right you hear things you don't
[41:03] understand you experience things that
[41:05] that seem gloomy to you in dark but
[41:07] remember the sun's coming up and we have
[41:09] a building we have a house to go back to
[41:12] oh I'm so thankful that when this
[41:13] temporary camping trip is over I got a
[41:16] place to go to I got a home made by God
[41:19] Amen made with eternal
[41:22] material something that'll oh Church
[41:24] make ought to make a shout this morning
[41:26] something that never Decay something
[41:28] that can never fall
[41:32] apart
[41:34] Hallelujah Abraham's actions were
[41:36] influenced by this house not made with
[41:40] hands Eternal in heaven so God had
[41:43] revealed to Abraham there's a city and
[41:44] there's a house or a Tabernacle in that
[41:46] City for you to live
[41:48] in Abraham's actions were influenced by
[41:52] that he saw what he saw but the
[41:55] expectation of Faith the Hebrews 111
[41:57] says faith is the substance of things
[42:00] hoped for the evidence of Things Not
[42:04] Seen for by it the elders obtained a
[42:08] good report through faith we understand
[42:11] that the worlds were framed by the word
[42:13] of God so that things which are seen
[42:16] were not made of things which do appear
[42:20] so Abraham and those after him looked
[42:22] for and died expecting something they
[42:25] never saw in
[42:27] life and they really didn't even
[42:30] understand it but they were looking for
[42:32] it something in them cried out for it
[42:35] because they were made to be a resident
[42:38] of that City you and I were made just
[42:42] like Abraham to be a resident of that
[42:44] City we were predestined to that place
[42:47] so Paul tells us in Hebrews 11 I don't
[42:50] have time to read it all but he tells us
[42:51] about Abel and Enoch and Noah and
[42:54] Abraham and Sarah and then he says this
[42:56] he said all died in faith not having
[43:00] received the promises but having seen
[43:02] them a far off and were persuaded of
[43:06] them that word is
[43:08] convinced and embraced them welcomed
[43:11] them right so when they were persuaded
[43:14] that the promises were real they were
[43:16] convinced of it they grabbed a hold of
[43:18] it they embraced it and confess that
[43:21] they were strangers and pilgrims on the
[43:24] earth for they that say such things
[43:26] declare plainly that they seek a country
[43:29] and truly if they' been mindful of that
[43:31] country from which they come out they
[43:33] might have had opportunity to have
[43:34] returned so in other words in order to
[43:36] reach this city you got to sell out to
[43:38] it in order to recognize you got to be
[43:40] willing to untether yourself from all of
[43:42] these cities and even from this house in
[43:46] order to reach that one oh church this
[43:50] robe of Flesh has to drop in order for
[43:52] us to go to a different one a new home
[43:56] he said they might have had opportunity
[43:57] to have returned but now they desire a
[44:00] better country that is a Heavenly
[44:01] wherefore God is not ashamed to be
[44:03] called their God for he hath prepared
[44:06] for them a
[44:08] city Oh my he talks about Isaac and
[44:12] Jacob and Joseph and Moses and
[44:16] Rahab and he says what shall I more say
[44:19] for the time would fail to tell me of
[44:21] Gideon and Barack and of Samson and of
[44:25] jeffa of David and Samuel of the
[44:27] prophets who through faith subdued
[44:30] kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained
[44:33] promises stopped the mouths of lions
[44:36] quenched the violence of fire escaped
[44:39] the edge of the sword look what they did
[44:41] and how they acted why they were looking
[44:43] for a city and this overarching theme
[44:46] and thought of their life influenced how
[44:49] they
[44:49] acted
[44:51] see if you just bear with me people who
[44:54] are overcome many times by their trials
[44:56] and it keeps them and they say well I
[44:58] just can't go to church I I can't serve
[45:00] God because this happened or that
[45:02] happened they just haven't got a vision
[45:05] yet right because no matter what you've
[45:08] gone through and I understand we go
[45:10] through things but no matter what you've
[45:11] gone through no matter what's happened
[45:13] in your life if you ever catch a hold of
[45:15] the vision that that that there's a
[45:16] better City a better place another world
[45:19] that's far beyond this one then your
[45:21] whole life begins to work towards that
[45:23] and you're able to do things that would
[45:25] seem to be impossible you're able to
[45:27] quench the violence of fire escaped the
[45:29] edge of the sword are you with me out of
[45:32] weakness we're made strong waxed Valiant
[45:34] in fight he said well I'm not a fighter
[45:36] but when it comes to fighting the enemy
[45:38] I'll fight why because it's my home I'm
[45:40] fighting for oh how many times have as a
[45:43] great big nation tried to invade a
[45:45] smaller one and I said surely we can
[45:46] overcome this Army but they realized
[45:48] them people were fighting for their home
[45:50] that's why they fight like they do
[45:52] listen the reason we fight like we do
[45:54] the reason we go to church like we do
[45:56] the reason we live like we do is we're
[45:57] fighting for another city we're fighting
[46:00] for another home we're not just fighting
[46:02] on Sunday we're fighting on Monday and
[46:03] Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday and
[46:05] Friday and Saturday we're fighting every
[46:06] day of the week every hour of the day
[46:09] fighting for another city fighting for a
[46:12] better place oh Church oh if we could
[46:14] just tell you this morning if I can
[46:16] encourage you brother Bru fight for that
[46:22] City don't let anything get you dragged
[46:24] down to this
[46:25] one fight for a better
[46:32] place women received their dead raised
[46:35] to life again others were
[46:38] tortured not accepting
[46:41] Deliverance that they might obtain a
[46:43] better
[46:45] Resurrection others had trial of cruel
[46:47] mockings and scourgings a were over
[46:50] Bonds in imprisonment they were stoned
[46:52] they were swn aunder they were tempted
[46:55] they were slain with the sword they
[46:56] wandered about and sheep skins and goat
[46:58] skins being DED Afflicted tormented of
[47:01] whom the world was not worthy they
[47:03] wandered in deserts and mountains and
[47:05] dens and caves of the earth and these
[47:07] all having obtained a good report
[47:09] through faith received not the
[47:13] promise God having
[47:16] provided Hallelujah some better thing
[47:20] for us that they without us should not
[47:24] be made perfect so they were held
[47:27] in Paradise until the coming of Christ
[47:32] are you with me now they without us
[47:34] should not be made perfect but then we
[47:35] realize the same thing during the church
[47:37] ages they were they were held they they
[47:40] believed and they were Bride for their
[47:42] age but they could not become what we
[47:44] become the fullness of the word why oh
[47:47] church we we we we receive the fullness
[47:50] of the word not that each one
[47:51] individually is that but together as the
[47:54] bride we are the fullness of the word
[47:56] what she is he what he is she is she's
[47:59] bone of his bone flesh of his flesh
[48:01] power of his power and so what we are
[48:04] doing is God has provided a better thing
[48:07] for us than even the church ages that
[48:09] they without us should not be made
[48:10] perfect this is what Abraham looked for
[48:13] listen a city that's been revealed to us
[48:16] with
[48:17] foundations do you realize we have
[48:19] everything but that body that's
[48:23] right that's the great thing about the
[48:25] message of the hour I don't think we
[48:26] realize that I don't think we recognize
[48:29] what's come look what we've come to Paul
[48:31] told the the Old Testament Believers the
[48:33] Hebrews he said we've come to a better
[48:36] mountain right a better Mountain that'll
[48:39] preach right there I think Stewart
[48:40] preached on that one time the mountains
[48:42] we've come to a better Mountain than
[48:43] Mount Si we've come to a better place
[48:46] Mount Si couldn't take away your sins
[48:48] but Mount Calvary will but what have we
[48:51] come to we've come to mount Sunset what
[48:54] was the attraction on the mountain the
[48:55] fullness of the world God himself coming
[48:58] down again in our age to give us all
[49:00] that we would have need of the last sign
[49:02] that we would ever need was given in our
[49:04] age to show us something what was it for
[49:06] to show us that we're ready it's here
[49:09] all we've got to do is get a new body
[49:12] are you with me now that's the only
[49:14] thing we're waiting
[49:16] on and that City become a reality to
[49:21] us now Abraham looked for a
[49:24] city that ha Foundation patience a more
[49:28] sure word of
[49:30] Prophecy and all of his actions as I
[49:32] said were influenced by this city and
[49:35] prefigured it he died expecting it now
[49:40] brother brandham ties this to our future
[49:43] home and if you haven't listened to
[49:44] Future home in a while future home of
[49:46] the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly
[49:47] bride go listen to it again it'll bless
[49:51] you amen he said this is the
[49:55] city right describing the city 1500 M
[49:59] Square in the shape of a pyramid and
[50:02] it's and people I don't know how people
[50:04] ever ever thought that that was around
[50:06] Jeffersonville by the way cuz brother
[50:08] Brown's very plain there's a reason why
[50:10] Abraham looked for the city where he did
[50:13] God called him into the promised land to
[50:16] look for that City this is the city that
[50:19] Abraham was looking for he said see
[50:21] being a prophet he knew that city was
[50:24] somewhere the Bible said so and he for s
[50:27] the city he lived and he went over look
[50:30] where he went exactly where it'll be
[50:34] exactly where it'll be amen and he said
[50:38] he was looking for a city whose Builder
[50:41] and maker was God see being a prophet
[50:42] Jesus gone to prepare with the Divine
[50:44] hands a Divine City a Divine architect
[50:47] for a Divine Boughton people for
[50:49] predestinated people he has gone to
[50:52] prepare Abraham was looking for it for
[50:55] what city for that City City and he
[50:58] professed that he was a pilgrim and a
[51:00] stranger for he looked for a city whose
[51:02] Builder maker was God he said that
[51:05] Prophet knowing it was
[51:07] somewhere right he knew it was somewhere
[51:10] now John sees it coming down saw it in
[51:13] symbol form remember but Abraham thought
[51:15] it must be on earth right then why he
[51:18] met MDC the king of
[51:21] it Hallelujah no wonder he was looking
[51:24] for a city because he actually met the
[51:28] king of
[51:30] Salem he met the king Hallelujah of
[51:34] Eternal peace he he met the king of the
[51:37] city and give him a tithe which had no
[51:40] father no mother he had no beginning of
[51:42] Life or no ending of life so having met
[51:45] the king Abraham decides there must be a
[51:48] city Hallelujah and they've never been
[51:51] able to find you know Scholars have
[51:52] looked at that and they can never find
[51:54] what city was they talking about what
[51:56] city was they talking about that mzc was
[51:58] king of he was king of that City he was
[52:02] hallelujah king of the Heavenly City and
[52:05] so Abraham met him and so having met him
[52:08] he recognized that there was a city he
[52:10] was going to go to and so he was not
[52:12] happy with cities of the earth listen to
[52:14] me church that's the same thing you and
[52:16] I got to do we've got to meet him and if
[52:18] you ever meet him you're looking for
[52:20] that
[52:21] City Abraham met him and they took
[52:24] communion right on the literal spot
[52:26] where the city will be raised up
[52:29] Hallelujah the Holy Mountain of the Lord
[52:32] where the redeemed will
[52:36] live think about it
[52:39] Church everything he did influenced by
[52:43] that City and everything we do
[52:46] influenced by that City looking at the
[52:49] Unseen but the B say some time ago I
[52:52] remember talking to an intellectual
[52:54] person it said how will you ever know
[52:56] there's anything different than just
[52:58] what any religion could produce that's a
[53:01] good question by the way how do you know
[53:04] that what you believe will produce
[53:05] anything different than any other
[53:08] religion would produce I said I read in
[53:11] the Bible of a living
[53:13] God I read of his goodness I read of his
[53:17] patience and his power and I believe
[53:20] that just as much as anybody could
[53:22] believe it but one
[53:24] day glory to God
[53:27] one day Abraham had heard about it God
[53:29] told him but one day he met the king of
[53:32] it one day I met the one I read about
[53:35] then there was a sudden change and I've
[53:38] never been the same since listen to me
[53:41] young people that's what's got to happen
[53:42] in every one of your lives there got to
[53:44] come a time there's a sudden change a
[53:47] sudden change and suddenly you're never
[53:49] the same you're looking for a city why
[53:51] you met the king of the city I've never
[53:53] been the same since and I hope I never
[53:55] will be something takes place when sight
[53:57] fails to produce it faith is there to
[54:00] catch the place and produce
[54:03] it Oh my he talks about Abraham and he
[54:06] said he got a glimpse of the Unseen by
[54:09] faith he saw it and the Bible says that
[54:11] he endured seeing the invisible god with
[54:13] him all along the road listen when a man
[54:15] once catches that Vision do you have the
[54:19] vision this morning have you caught the
[54:20] vision when once a man catches that
[54:23] vision of the invisible God and know
[54:25] that he's always present there's
[54:27] something that stabilizes that man's
[54:32] thinking right so before he met the king
[54:35] he's in out up down didn't know really
[54:39] know what he believed wasn't really sure
[54:42] where he
[54:43] belonged
[54:45] right but when he met the king of the
[54:48] city Hallelujah and caught the vision
[54:52] yes sir he endured seeing the invisible
[54:54] god with him all along the road and when
[54:57] he when he catches that it brought
[54:59] stability to his
[55:01] thinking it
[55:03] stabilizes his
[55:06] actions right so when you see
[55:08] instability what needs to happen many
[55:11] times out of our
[55:14] instability I got to be careful here but
[55:16] many times what we're trying to do is
[55:18] our instability when we got instability
[55:20] in our home now listen to me it matters
[55:23] when we got instability in our home we
[55:27] we see that chaos and we want to order
[55:29] the
[55:30] chaos if that makes sense we try to
[55:33] stack this here I'm talking mentally now
[55:35] in our in our mind we put this here and
[55:38] this here and this here and we say well
[55:40] if he would do this and she would do
[55:42] that but the gospel doesn't call us to
[55:45] that it might be a good mental exercise
[55:48] to clear your mind but the gospel is not
[55:51] the reordering of your
[55:52] thoughts it's the stabilizing
[55:56] of your thoughts because the enemy is
[55:59] always going to be able to come in but
[56:01] what is the gospel there for the enemy
[56:03] comes in and says you're sick you're
[56:05] going to die but the gospel says I'm the
[56:08] god that heals all your diseases and you
[56:11] met the king of the city see you know
[56:12] the city is real so you believe the word
[56:15] that comes out of from the
[56:17] King right and so it stabilizes your
[56:20] thoughts and your actions so it
[56:22] stabilizes when you when you think well
[56:25] you know my husband doesn't love me or
[56:26] my wife doesn't love me I think I'll
[56:28] just go leave them and go get another
[56:29] one but this church what happens when
[56:33] you see see you you don't need just to
[56:35] be reordered you need to see what
[56:37] Abraham saw you need to see there's
[56:40] another life beyond this one so let me
[56:43] order My Life by the word let me love my
[56:45] wife like Christ loved the church let me
[56:47] obey my husband and honor my husband
[56:49] like God said to do why why why am I
[56:51] doing that not because they acted
[56:53] different or the preacher acted
[56:54] different but because I've my my
[56:56] thinking has been
[56:59] stabilized right I go to church because
[57:02] my thinking has been
[57:04] stabilized are you with me now I believe
[57:07] the word because my I don't get too high
[57:10] or too low because my thinking has been
[57:13] stabilized by catching the vision of an
[57:15] invisible
[57:18] God and in the time of distress and
[57:21] trouble he said it'll still make him
[57:23] look upward and above the
[57:27] things that are happening older people
[57:29] get really good at this because they
[57:30] have
[57:31] to right I'm going to preach I'm going
[57:34] to give a little our elders we ought to
[57:36] we to thank God for our elders they've
[57:38] gotten really good at looking at another
[57:39] city because they have
[57:42] to right because there's not much in
[57:45] this body when you as you get older to
[57:47] be proud of now come
[57:49] on right that's right used to you could
[57:52] maybe lift so much and walk so far and
[57:56] and do so much and look so
[58:00] pretty but as age comes on you you got
[58:02] less and less in this body to be proud
[58:05] of so I know there's some people that
[58:06] just desperately try to keep that alive
[58:08] so you get Hollywood actresses that look
[58:10] like they're well if you see them from a
[58:12] distance they look like they're 16 and
[58:14] you get closer and realize they're
[58:17] not Hollywood actresses and southern
[58:19] gospel
[58:21] singers y'all know what I'm talking
[58:24] about they paint their face and they get
[58:26] all you know nice and pretty and you get
[58:29] real close you realize they've they've
[58:33] aged what's happening they're trying to
[58:35] keep that alive but there's got to be a
[58:38] time as you get older and I think most
[58:40] of our elders have settled into this
[58:41] that you realize hey this world can't be
[58:46] it there's got to be something better I
[58:49] see pain every day I go through trials
[58:51] every day sometimes I struggle to get up
[58:53] and go sometimes I can't remember what I
[58:55] want to remember but remember he's still
[58:57] there with
[58:58] you what's he doing he just pulling the
[59:00] feathers out of the nest he got to make
[59:02] us uncomfortable enough that we want to
[59:04] go home he's calling us to a better City
[59:07] we were never called to live in West
[59:09] Plains we were never called to live in
[59:10] kosanam we were never called to live in
[59:13] Hardy we were never called to live in in
[59:15] wherever it is that you live in
[59:16] Jonesboro we weren't called to that City
[59:18] we were called to the New Jerusalem a
[59:20] city not made with hands we were called
[59:23] to look at the
[59:24] Unseen as you get you begin to recognize
[59:27] that you begin to see there's something
[59:30] more something more valuable all if our
[59:33] young people could only catch a glimpse
[59:35] of that there something more than this
[59:37] life there's something more you think
[59:39] well if I could ever get that boy to
[59:40] speak to me if I could ever get that
[59:42] girl to talk to me don't you realize
[59:43] there's something more than that that
[59:45] might be good but how much more is it to
[59:47] get the king to talk to
[59:52] you he's looking at the Unseen
[59:56] in the time of distress and trouble make
[59:58] him look upward and above the things
[59:59] that are happening around him because
[1:00:01] he's looking at the Unseen yet by
[1:00:03] promise and the reason he believed it
[1:00:06] was because God said
[1:00:08] it and if we being dead in Christ we are
[1:00:13] Abraham's seed and if the spirit that
[1:00:16] was in Christ dwells in US it does the
[1:00:19] same
[1:00:21] thing it takes every Divine promise of
[1:00:24] God that's in his Bible
[1:00:26] I love this calls it present
[1:00:30] tense Hallelujah and rest itself upon
[1:00:36] there he said where if you look at with
[1:00:38] your eyes and you see now that our
[1:00:40] nation is shaking and trembling amen we
[1:00:44] could say Amen to that today as it was
[1:00:46] in in the 50s and the 60s it is today
[1:00:50] War clouds are flying everywhere uh
[1:00:52] Russia just put a a a nuclear uh uh a uh
[1:00:56] satellite into space that has to do with
[1:00:58] nuclear weapons we've got drones flying
[1:01:01] around
[1:01:03] everywhere I'm it's going to be really
[1:01:04] funny if that turns out to be some kind
[1:01:06] of high school prank but but what nobody
[1:01:09] knows what it is and the government
[1:01:11] won't tell us what it is our government
[1:01:13] lies to us for our own good every
[1:01:16] day that's just a fact things we don't
[1:01:20] need to know they say right we live in
[1:01:23] that kind of world but we've always it's
[1:01:25] always been that kind kind of world but
[1:01:27] it keeps getting worse and worse in this
[1:01:28] nation as they get farther and farther
[1:01:30] away from God but he said every sign
[1:01:32] that Jesus said would happen is
[1:01:34] happening there would be signs in the
[1:01:36] heavens above and in the earth below and
[1:01:38] great things would be taking place like
[1:01:39] flying saucers and Mystic things taking
[1:01:42] place but he commanded his church to
[1:01:44] lift up their heads list to be church we
[1:01:47] are not to put our heads down but to
[1:01:49] lift up our heads in that day and to
[1:01:51] look up for the Unseen Christ will be
[1:01:53] appearing pretty soon so if we only
[1:01:56] walked by sight we would be Children Of
[1:01:58] Darkness sure enough now but I'm so glad
[1:02:00] to know there is a light that shines in
[1:02:02] every believer's heart until that
[1:02:03] Eternal day when Jesus shall
[1:02:05] come Hallelujah when Sarah died Abraham
[1:02:10] knew it wasn't
[1:02:12] over cuz we're going to live in that
[1:02:14] city right hallelujah we're going to
[1:02:18] live in that City we've got a home a
[1:02:21] body has been
[1:02:24] prepared so Genesis 23:1 and Sarah was
[1:02:27] 107 and20 years old 127 so sister
[1:02:32] Fritz's got a little while and brother
[1:02:35] sister Curtis have a little while to go
[1:02:39] 127 these were the years of the life of
[1:02:41] Sarah and Sarah died in Kurth arba the
[1:02:44] same as heon in the land of Canaan and
[1:02:46] Abraham came to mourn for Sarah and to
[1:02:49] weep for her oh my there's so much we
[1:02:52] could get into there I just don't have
[1:02:54] time today I'm just looking at one side
[1:02:55] of this but you go and and find that
[1:02:58] that's why Caleb fought for that
[1:03:00] land right give me my
[1:03:04] mountain right Hallelujah and Abraham
[1:03:08] stood up from before his dead and spake
[1:03:09] to the sons of H saying I'm a stranger
[1:03:12] and Sojourner with you give me a
[1:03:14] possession of a burying place with you
[1:03:16] that I may bury my dead out of my
[1:03:19] sight now the closest thing that we've
[1:03:21] had in in modern times in the last
[1:03:23] several hundred years to Abraham's life
[1:03:26] would be the the the ban the the bin in
[1:03:29] the desert they travel like Abraham did
[1:03:31] and they live in
[1:03:33] tents and people like Lawrence of Arabia
[1:03:36] people that went and spent time with
[1:03:38] them and lived with them said that the
[1:03:40] ban usually buried their dead in a in a
[1:03:43] simple ceremony in the place where they
[1:03:45] died so if they got killed they just
[1:03:48] buried them right there because they had
[1:03:50] no sure resting place now Abraham had
[1:03:54] never cared where he
[1:03:58] lived but he cared where they put him
[1:04:00] when he
[1:04:02] died right he Hallelujah he didn't have
[1:04:06] a place on Earth that he could call home
[1:04:10] even though God said it's all
[1:04:13] yours right he said it's all yours but
[1:04:16] Abraham didn't have a single place if
[1:04:18] you Abraham where do you live he'd say
[1:04:20] well I stay right now over such and such
[1:04:23] a
[1:04:24] place he had no place to call
[1:04:27] home but there's something in our heart
[1:04:29] that longs for home isn't there some
[1:04:32] place where we can belong but be careful
[1:04:34] that you don't get too tied to a
[1:04:36] particular place that's because nothing
[1:04:39] down here will ever really satisfy that
[1:04:42] longing so he doesn't care so much where
[1:04:46] he lives just in the promised land right
[1:04:49] but he cares the spot where he's going
[1:04:52] to bury his wife and where he will be
[1:04:55] buried
[1:04:56] so he goes to a certain particular
[1:04:59] place and he begins to negotiate he
[1:05:02] bowed down himself before the people of
[1:05:03] the land and he spake unto Ephron and
[1:05:06] the audience of the people of the land
[1:05:07] saying but if thou will give it I pray
[1:05:09] thee hear me I will give thee money for
[1:05:11] the field take it of me oh bury my dead
[1:05:13] there and so he begins to talk to them
[1:05:16] and you remember they had told him they
[1:05:18] said well just take it we we want to
[1:05:20] give it to you you're a great man a
[1:05:22] prince Among Us he said no he said I
[1:05:24] want to buy it
[1:05:26] I want to get a deed for it I don't want
[1:05:29] to contract for deed I don't want a
[1:05:31] mortgage I don't want to rent
[1:05:33] it I want a deed for it so the only
[1:05:37] property that Abraham ever
[1:05:40] owns is is a burial
[1:05:43] plot oh my a burial plot I love the fact
[1:05:47] that he got it big enough to bury him
[1:05:51] and his
[1:05:52] family in that same place
[1:05:55] and believing that they would want to
[1:05:58] return to that same place he had already
[1:06:00] been told they would be strangers in a
[1:06:02] Strange Land for 400
[1:06:04] years so they begin to negotiate
[1:06:06] backwards kind
[1:06:08] of from free to full
[1:06:11] price in Genesis 23:14 says Ephron
[1:06:14] answered Abraham saying unto him my Lord
[1:06:16] hearken unto me the land is worth 400
[1:06:19] sheckel of silver what is that betwix me
[1:06:21] and thee so he's still trying to get him
[1:06:22] just take it said bury therefore thy
[1:06:25] dead and Abraham hearkened to Ephron
[1:06:26] Abraham weighed he said if that's what
[1:06:27] you say it's worth he weighed to Ephron
[1:06:30] the silver which he had named in the
[1:06:32] audience of the sons of Heth of 400
[1:06:34] shekels of silver so there was a
[1:06:35] transaction there would be no question
[1:06:38] about who owned this
[1:06:40] land hallelujah it's done publicly so
[1:06:44] there would be no question he bought it
[1:06:47] and the field of Ephron which was in MPA
[1:06:50] which was before mamory the field and
[1:06:53] the cave which was therein and all the
[1:06:55] trees that were in the field I love the
[1:06:57] way the Bible describes this that were
[1:06:59] in all the borders round about were made
[1:07:02] sure and what that means is that if you
[1:07:04] got property you probably seeing a legal
[1:07:06] description now if you live in town it
[1:07:09] probably says lot one of block 10 of
[1:07:12] something something subdivision right
[1:07:14] but if you live in the country it
[1:07:16] doesn't say that it says go you know 90
[1:07:20] degrees this direction and 89 degrees
[1:07:22] this direction and and it's really hard
[1:07:24] to follow right
[1:07:26] but the way that used to be if you look
[1:07:27] at old Deeds it wasn't done that way it
[1:07:30] was done from the big post oak
[1:07:32] tree right to the corner of the
[1:07:35] barn that's the way they did Deeds I've
[1:07:37] looked at many of them where they did
[1:07:39] that because that's what I did for a
[1:07:40] living and so we had to go way back you
[1:07:43] get back in an abstract you begin to see
[1:07:44] some of them would put it would put a
[1:07:46] piece of used farm equipment bury it in
[1:07:48] the ground and that would be the corner
[1:07:50] post right or they would go from a creek
[1:07:53] you know a a a sometimes what always uh
[1:07:56] exasperated me is when they would go
[1:07:58] from a a wet weather
[1:08:00] Creek right cuz that Creek may not even
[1:08:02] exist before long cuz the it's only
[1:08:05] there when it rains if it quits raining
[1:08:06] you got trouble so that that causes all
[1:08:09] kinds of conflict so what but what they
[1:08:11] did what they would have done is they
[1:08:12] would have walked around the land and
[1:08:14] they would have made sure of all the
[1:08:17] borders of the land they would say
[1:08:19] that's why it says the the cave and the
[1:08:22] trees right they would go from one tree
[1:08:24] to another say this from this tree to
[1:08:27] that one something that would last see
[1:08:30] to over there back here and they wrote
[1:08:32] it down it was an early form of a legal
[1:08:35] description to make sure that the cave
[1:08:38] was in
[1:08:40] it and where he was going to bury Sarah
[1:08:43] so he had to make sure there was no
[1:08:46] defect in the legal description oh
[1:08:48] church that's what God did in our age he
[1:08:51] sent a prophet to take the book The
[1:08:54] Abstract clear the the title back and
[1:08:56] what did he do he brought back tied up
[1:08:58] all the loose sins made the legal
[1:09:00] there's something we had to do called
[1:09:01] making the legal description close so we
[1:09:04] had to be able to follow it around make
[1:09:06] sure that if it started here it had to
[1:09:08] come back to the same place don't you
[1:09:09] realize that's what the message of the
[1:09:11] hour does it brings us from glory to
[1:09:13] glory it brought us from the mind of God
[1:09:16] brought us all the way around through
[1:09:17] the church ages and down until we come
[1:09:19] back to the mind of God again it has to
[1:09:23] close this the Alpha and the Omega have
[1:09:25] to be the
[1:09:27] same Hallelujah we we could just
[1:09:29] Minister on that all day but I don't
[1:09:31] have time look all the trees were in the
[1:09:34] field all the borders were made sure
[1:09:36] unto Abraham for possession in the
[1:09:38] presence of the children of heav before
[1:09:40] all that went in at the Gate of his City
[1:09:42] so they put it that then instead of
[1:09:44] having a courthouse say at the gate was
[1:09:46] where all business was transacted he
[1:09:48] made sure everybody understood this the
[1:09:50] public notice Abraham owns the cave and
[1:09:54] the field
[1:09:55] of mpel now why this particular field
[1:09:58] now Abraham being a prophet always went
[1:10:01] back to what a previous Prophet
[1:10:03] said right this is important if you
[1:10:07] think someone's a prophet don't look at
[1:10:10] whether they do signs and
[1:10:12] wonders look and see if they go back to
[1:10:16] what a previous Prophet
[1:10:19] said right that's how you that's their
[1:10:22] Vindication as a prophet are they going
[1:10:25] to stay with a prophet's words the same
[1:10:27] thing with a minister or a pastor always
[1:10:30] look and make sure that the pastor is
[1:10:31] going back to what a previous Prophet
[1:10:34] said right that he knows how important
[1:10:36] it is to say what a prophet said right
[1:10:39] the way brother Brandon put it so
[1:10:41] someone you say well I respect him
[1:10:43] because of who he is you better make
[1:10:45] sure that what he's saying goes back to
[1:10:48] what brother brandom said the previous
[1:10:50] Prophet brother brandom made sure what
[1:10:53] he said went back to what Paul said the
[1:10:55] previous Pro are you with me now right
[1:10:58] Paul tied what he believed back to the
[1:10:59] Old Testament are you with me now so
[1:11:03] Abraham would have known what the
[1:11:04] previous Prophet said what job said
[1:11:07] about the resurrection in job
[1:11:10] 19:23 job what happened to job job was
[1:11:13] going through some things but he met the
[1:11:15] king of the
[1:11:16] city Hallelujah job 1923 oh that my
[1:11:20] words were not written oh that they were
[1:11:21] printed in a book that they were Graven
[1:11:23] with an iron pin and Leed in the rockes
[1:11:25] ever for I know that my redeemer liveth
[1:11:29] brother B said before he supposed he he
[1:11:31] guessed he thought maybe it was so but
[1:11:33] now he can say I know why he met the
[1:11:36] king Hallelujah God revealed it to him I
[1:11:39] know my redeemer liveth and he that that
[1:11:42] he shall stand at the latter day upon
[1:11:43] the Earth though after my skin worms
[1:11:45] destroy this body yet in my flesh shall
[1:11:47] I see God whom I shall see for myself my
[1:11:49] eyes shall be holding not another though
[1:11:51] my Reigns be consumed within me Abraham
[1:11:53] would have known what job propes side he
[1:11:56] would have known about the resurrection
[1:11:58] so when it come time for Sarah to die he
[1:12:00] said let's find a place near
[1:12:04] job huh let's find a place oh Church job
[1:12:09] died in the same Land look Abraham said
[1:12:12] I've I've had the same kind of a vision
[1:12:15] this is brother Brandon talking Abraham
[1:12:16] said I've had the same kind of a vision
[1:12:18] went up yonder on the mountain when
[1:12:21] Christ God met me and give me his
[1:12:23] Redemptive names Jehovah J Jehovah RF
[1:12:26] and all those seeing the death burial
[1:12:27] and Resurrection brother BR talked about
[1:12:29] how that was typed in Isaac what did we
[1:12:32] talk about last week Jehovah Gyra why
[1:12:34] did Abraham believe he had met the king
[1:12:37] of the city he believed in a
[1:12:39] resurrection in a better City so he knew
[1:12:41] that if he put Isaac in the ground Isaac
[1:12:44] would come up out of the
[1:12:46] ground
[1:12:47] church oh he met the king of the city
[1:12:51] and so what was it he said that that he
[1:12:54] was willing to lay his life down he said
[1:12:56] knowing I received him as one from the
[1:12:57] dead I believed he would raise him up
[1:12:59] again and through this great hope that
[1:13:01] beats in my heart I know he said he
[1:13:02] could raise him up see it was a
[1:13:04] foresight of the Resurrection the same
[1:13:06] thing job had so he said now I'm a joint
[1:13:08] air with job so bury me in the same
[1:13:11] ground that's right so they took him
[1:13:13] over there took Sarah over and buried
[1:13:14] her right near
[1:13:18] job how do you know where job was buried
[1:13:20] I don't know if they had a sign up this
[1:13:22] is the burial place of job or if he just
[1:13:24] if he there's just some understanding
[1:13:26] that come to his heart I haven't found
[1:13:28] where job said where he would be buried
[1:13:31] but it was there in that land because he
[1:13:33] said bury me near job uh we could put it
[1:13:36] like this give me that same Revelation
[1:13:38] yes right he had the same Revelation job
[1:13:41] had so he buried himself in the same
[1:13:44] place he had Sarah buried in the same
[1:13:46] place then him himself and then his
[1:13:48] children he said I'm a joint air with
[1:13:50] job so bury me in the same ground so
[1:13:52] they took him over there took Sarah over
[1:13:54] and buried it right near job
[1:13:55] now it was what was it that made him buy
[1:13:59] the field right why would Abraham spend
[1:14:02] good money for something that he may not
[1:14:05] ever see again in life cuz he was a
[1:14:08] pilgrim and a
[1:14:09] stranger why would he pay good money for
[1:14:13] a burial place full price because
[1:14:17] something in his heart caused him to to
[1:14:21] do it because he had a revelation
[1:14:25] of the
[1:14:26] Resurrection brother B taught us that
[1:14:28] the resurrection in Your Heart Makes You
[1:14:31] Want To Serve God I should have preached
[1:14:34] this at Easter and not at Christmas I
[1:14:35] guess but you know he came to die so he
[1:14:39] could be
[1:14:41] raised job when he'd seen this and
[1:14:45] Abraham saw it he buried Sarah there job
[1:14:47] purchased the field bought it with his
[1:14:50] money so that it would be assured
[1:14:55] put Witnesses before it he was assured
[1:14:57] he bought this field for a burying place
[1:15:00] I'm going somewhere this morning I I
[1:15:01] won't hold you all day but I want us to
[1:15:03] really get this and then Abraham himself
[1:15:06] when he died he was buried with them in
[1:15:07] the same field Genesis 259 his sons
[1:15:10] Isaac and Ishmael buried him where in
[1:15:12] the cave of mpil in the field of Ephron
[1:15:16] the son of the Zohar the hittite which
[1:15:18] is before
[1:15:19] mamry so when Jacob got through blessing
[1:15:23] his children you know
[1:15:26] know here was here was Isaac uh and he
[1:15:31] was actually buried in the same place
[1:15:33] and then Jacob gets through blessing his
[1:15:35] children in Genesis 49 we've just been
[1:15:37] through the story of Joseph and he
[1:15:39] charged them and said of them I am to be
[1:15:41] gathered unto my people bury me with my
[1:15:46] fathers in the cave that is in the field
[1:15:49] of Ephron the hittite so even you young
[1:15:52] people understand that you want to be
[1:15:53] buried in the cave same place right
[1:15:56] that's pretty simple there they buried
[1:15:59] he said Abraham and Sarah his wife there
[1:16:02] they buried Isaac and Rebecca and there
[1:16:05] I buried Leah remember we talked about
[1:16:09] that he didn't bury Rachel there he
[1:16:10] buried Leah in the place of the
[1:16:13] Resurrection the one he didn't even want
[1:16:15] but God give him that's right right
[1:16:19] Joseph said the same thing Joseph says
[1:16:21] to his breth in Genesis 15:24 I die and
[1:16:25] God will surely visit you bring you out
[1:16:27] of this land un the land which he swear
[1:16:29] to Abraham to Isaac and to Jacob and
[1:16:31] Joseph took an oath of the children of
[1:16:34] Israel saying God will surely visit you
[1:16:37] and you shall carry my
[1:16:39] bones Hallelujah carry up my bones from
[1:16:42] it so when they come out there was a
[1:16:44] strange thing here they were coming out
[1:16:46] of Egypt with joy and rejoicing but it
[1:16:48] was also a funeral procession here they
[1:16:50] come with the bones of Joseph what was
[1:16:52] it not with sorrow but with gladness he
[1:16:54] wanted be buried in the same place said
[1:16:57] carry my
[1:16:58] bones by eyes of Faith what was it they
[1:17:01] saw the place of the
[1:17:03] resurrection and and they were looking
[1:17:05] forward to a time when Christ would come
[1:17:07] remember they would be raised from
[1:17:09] Paradise at that time all of these
[1:17:11] Patriarchs waited there until Jesus
[1:17:15] died when he died the veil was
[1:17:20] rent and the Bible says the graves were
[1:17:23] opened
[1:17:25] and many bodies of the Saints which
[1:17:29] slept
[1:17:31] arose and came out of the graves after
[1:17:34] his resurrection and went into the holy
[1:17:37] city and appeared unto many brother BR
[1:17:39] dramatized that how they would kind of
[1:17:41] go around the corner and somebody might
[1:17:42] recognize them and they disappear you
[1:17:44] know travel like a thought right they
[1:17:46] they come to the
[1:17:47] city oh
[1:17:49] my now where were they coming to the
[1:17:52] sight of the future home that's right
[1:17:56] right they come to the city and when
[1:17:58] they come they looked around and said
[1:18:00] not
[1:18:01] yet it's under Roman control are you I'm
[1:18:05] just dramatized but you understand it's
[1:18:07] under Roman control everything's that
[1:18:10] it's all everything's all uh messed
[1:18:14] up here's Caesar here's his Legions
[1:18:17] here's the Jews just crucified Jesus
[1:18:21] nobody was believing nobody they said no
[1:18:23] this isn't it
[1:18:25] but there's one coming so they go into
[1:18:27] the sixth Dimension look when Jesus
[1:18:31] raised from the dead brother the B said
[1:18:32] job seen that coming he said I know my
[1:18:35] redeemer liveth the last day shall stand
[1:18:36] upon this Earth though the skin worms
[1:18:38] have destroyed this body yet in my flesh
[1:18:39] I'll see God I'll see him that
[1:18:41] quickening power coming to the grave of
[1:18:42] job where there wasn't even a spoonful
[1:18:45] of the Dust of his bones left Paul we
[1:18:49] talked about that that question that you
[1:18:50] had but listen if there's not even a
[1:18:52] spoonful of the Dust of the bones
[1:18:55] after all those hundreds and hundreds
[1:18:56] and hundreds of years his bones had
[1:18:58] decayed it went back and turned back to
[1:18:59] the gases of the earth and just a mere
[1:19:01] Ash dust laid there but yet when that
[1:19:03] quickening power according to the word
[1:19:05] of God to the promise hundreds and
[1:19:07] hundreds thousands of years later when
[1:19:08] that quickening power was brought forth
[1:19:09] from the grave job Abraham Isaac Jacob
[1:19:12] all of them come out of the Grave with
[1:19:14] him glory to God what was it he was the
[1:19:17] first fruits of the resurrection and
[1:19:19] they knew that the first fruits of the
[1:19:20] Resurrection was coming out of the
[1:19:21] promised land not Egypt he said they
[1:19:24] were spirit spiritual they were prophets
[1:19:26] when Jesus died on Good Friday raised up
[1:19:27] on Easter morning the following Sunday
[1:19:29] morning the Bible said many of the
[1:19:30] saints that slept in the dust of the
[1:19:32] earth raised up and come out of the
[1:19:33] graves went into the city went on into
[1:19:34] Glory with him why it was them prophets
[1:19:36] that knew exactly where to be buried at
[1:19:38] the place at the time it was hid from
[1:19:40] the eyes of the wise but they knew they
[1:19:43] looked at the Spirit side the first
[1:19:44] fruit of the Resurrection was to come
[1:19:45] out of Palestine not out of Egypt so it
[1:19:48] is today friends so many people listen
[1:19:50] hold on to things of the world or some
[1:19:52] great system or something be bury me in
[1:19:56] Jesus oh how many could say Amen to that
[1:19:59] today bury me in Jesus don't bury me in
[1:20:02] a church don't bury me in a
[1:20:04] denominational name bury me in Jesus
[1:20:07] don't bury me in some doctrinal name in
[1:20:09] this message bury me in
[1:20:13] Jesus for those that are in Christ will
[1:20:15] God bring with him in that resurrection
[1:20:18] and I don't care what the world's got to
[1:20:20] say he said how much they try to
[1:20:22] teliz things ensil I'm going to get into
[1:20:26] that maybe but later but t or later not
[1:20:28] today they try to tinsil eyesee things
[1:20:30] but talks about Christmas tinsel tinsil
[1:20:33] was something people didn't know it was
[1:20:34] shiny but it was bad for you made it out
[1:20:37] of lead they try to tinzee things it's
[1:20:40] in Christ those that are in Christ that
[1:20:42] God will bring with him the spiritual
[1:20:44] mind he said catches those spiritual
[1:20:48] things the spiritual mind catches those
[1:20:51] spiritual things look now the Bible
[1:20:54] tells us cuz we're looking for a city
[1:20:56] everybody with me so far I got a few
[1:20:59] more minutes it says Colossians 210 you
[1:21:02] are complete in him which is the head of
[1:21:05] all principality and Power in whom also
[1:21:08] you're circumcised with the circumcision
[1:21:09] made without hands putting off the body
[1:21:11] of the sins of the flesh by the
[1:21:13] circumcision of Christ buried with him
[1:21:15] in baptism so what's he saying you don't
[1:21:17] have to be circumcised In the Flesh
[1:21:19] because you're circumcised in
[1:21:20] Christ right buried with him in baptism
[1:21:24] where and also you are risen with him
[1:21:27] remember we talked about that in Christ
[1:21:29] as the mystery of God revealed you're
[1:21:30] part of him the bride was in him when he
[1:21:33] died your sin was judged in him when he
[1:21:37] died you're risen with him through the
[1:21:39] faith of the operation of God who have
[1:21:41] raised him from the dead and you being
[1:21:43] dead in your sins and the uncircumcision
[1:21:46] of your flesh ha pass
[1:21:49] tense now look remember they had to
[1:21:52] raise and then they recognized this this
[1:21:55] is him right he come down and and
[1:21:57] emptied Paradise now we don't do that we
[1:22:00] go we go to the sixth Dimension we wait
[1:22:03] and then if we die or we're raptured in
[1:22:05] a moment in twinkling of an eye we're
[1:22:06] caught up together right but why did
[1:22:09] they have to do that now it had to come
[1:22:11] oh my by way of the Cross that's what B
[1:22:13] paid for their sin was the cross that's
[1:22:17] what blotted out the handwriting of
[1:22:18] ordinances against him was the cross he
[1:22:20] said well well when does that happen to
[1:22:22] us well we meet him' we are raised a
[1:22:26] pre- resurrection Resurrection we are
[1:22:29] quickened from dead trespasses and works
[1:22:32] are you with me now we are quickened by
[1:22:35] the spirit of God for what purpose for
[1:22:38] the purpose of the Resurrection that our
[1:22:41] bodies might be changed one day our
[1:22:43] souls are are awakened to that City so
[1:22:47] that our bodies one day could be
[1:22:49] awakened to that City you being dead in
[1:22:53] your sins uncircumcised
[1:22:55] he said he blotted out the handwriting
[1:22:56] of ordinances that was against us we
[1:22:59] were driving down the road the other day
[1:23:00] and my mother was telling me not you
[1:23:02] know slow
[1:23:05] down uh put your phone
[1:23:07] down you know which is what she does
[1:23:09] when she's in the car love my mom
[1:23:13] but if it wasn't for my wife and my
[1:23:15] mother I'd just be driving in a field
[1:23:17] somewhere just just making
[1:23:22] circles and I said but Mom she said obey
[1:23:25] the law I said Mom but the the
[1:23:26] handwriting of ordinances that was
[1:23:28] against
[1:23:30] me was blotted
[1:23:33] out oh my oh I believe we ought to obey
[1:23:36] the law of this land but there was a law
[1:23:38] that was against us it was the law of
[1:23:40] God and it was blotted out I can't be
[1:23:43] judged for sin why I was in
[1:23:46] him that's why when you think when you
[1:23:48] go through something you think this is
[1:23:49] the Judgment of God on me it is not it
[1:23:52] could be his hand correcting you
[1:23:53] allowing things to come to correct you
[1:23:55] but he is not judging you he can't judge
[1:23:57] you if you're a Christian you belong to
[1:23:59] him and even the Judgment of these out
[1:24:02] here has been put off his wrath will
[1:24:04] come one day his judgment will come but
[1:24:06] right now is the time for Mercy he can't
[1:24:09] judge you he's you've already been
[1:24:11] judged in the
[1:24:12] cross Hallelujah you were in him there
[1:24:14] and you were quickened with him and the
[1:24:17] handwriting of words was blotted was
[1:24:19] blotted out which was contrary to us
[1:24:21] took it out of the way nailing it to his
[1:24:22] cross what they would do
[1:24:24] in that time when some when someone was
[1:24:26] pardoned when or or when a when a
[1:24:29] mortgage was paid they would take the
[1:24:31] the the the skin that was written on or
[1:24:33] the paper the parchment that was written
[1:24:35] on and they would blot it out and nail
[1:24:37] it in public so people could see it he
[1:24:39] said the law was blot it out where you
[1:24:41] couldn't even oh Church you couldn't
[1:24:44] even read what you did anymore he said
[1:24:46] he don't even remember
[1:24:48] it contrary to us took it out of the way
[1:24:50] nailing it to his cross and having
[1:24:51] spoiled principalities and Powers made
[1:24:54] it show them hopefully triumphing over
[1:24:56] them in it what was it you were buried
[1:24:59] with him raised with him Romans 6:3 know
[1:25:02] you're not so many of us as we baptized
[1:25:05] how many of you have been baptized
[1:25:07] you've been
[1:25:08] baptized I asked that question in Egypt
[1:25:11] and everybody said oh yeah we've been
[1:25:13] baptized come to find out they were
[1:25:14] baptized as infants no we don't believe
[1:25:16] in infant baptism because the infant
[1:25:18] doesn't know what they're doing that's
[1:25:19] right right you're just giving them a
[1:25:21] bath right but it's got to be when you
[1:25:23] know what you're doing how old is that
[1:25:24] brother Ben I however old you when you
[1:25:26] know what you're doing I'll say this
[1:25:28] don't turn your kids down if they really
[1:25:30] want that and they express a sincere
[1:25:32] desire and you feel like they understand
[1:25:33] a little bit what they're doing because
[1:25:35] sometimes I was baptized at
[1:25:36] 7 and I ain't never looked
[1:25:39] back and sometimes that's what you need
[1:25:42] they're ready they're tender and I know
[1:25:45] of at least one case I don't know why
[1:25:46] I'm talking about that but I know of at
[1:25:47] least one case where a parent turned
[1:25:49] down their son being baptized and that
[1:25:51] mother come to me weeping years later
[1:25:52] and said he never has been baptized ized
[1:25:55] because I thought he wasn't good enough
[1:25:57] he wasn't living good enough to get
[1:25:59] baptized we we don't live good enough to
[1:26:01] be baptized a man come brother BR said I
[1:26:03] want to be baptized nobody will baptize
[1:26:05] me because I smoke he said I don't have
[1:26:07] nothing to do with
[1:26:08] it you're baptized to identify yourself
[1:26:11] bury yourself with him so you can lose
[1:26:13] that desire to
[1:26:18] smoke right so so he said we were
[1:26:21] baptized into Jesus we were baptized
[1:26:23] into his death so as many of us as we're
[1:26:26] baptized to Jesus we're baptized into
[1:26:28] his death therefore we are buried with
[1:26:31] him Hallelujah just like Isaac was
[1:26:35] buried with Abraham and Sarah Hallelujah
[1:26:39] we are buried with him by baptism into
[1:26:41] death like as Christ was raised up from
[1:26:43] the dead by the glory of the father even
[1:26:44] so we also should walk in newness of
[1:26:46] life for if we've been planted together
[1:26:48] in the likeness of his death we shall be
[1:26:50] also in the likeness of his resurrection
[1:26:52] knowing this that our old man is
[1:26:54] crucified with him no we don't believe
[1:26:55] just the water does that it's just a
[1:26:56] symbol of what's taking place on the
[1:26:58] inside we're being buried our old man is
[1:27:02] dying and the new man's coming on we we
[1:27:05] are a new creature in Christ we are we
[1:27:07] are buried with him our old man is
[1:27:09] crucified with him that the body of sin
[1:27:11] might be destroyed that his forth we
[1:27:12] should not serve sin for he that is dead
[1:27:14] is freed from sin how do we do that
[1:27:16] we're baptized not just by water but by
[1:27:18] Spirit 1 Corinthians 12:13 for by one
[1:27:20] Spirit someone say one Spirit one Spirit
[1:27:23] are we all baptized into one body we're
[1:27:26] one body Church don't pick apart the
[1:27:27] body you need the body don't sit there
[1:27:30] and judge get judgmental about the body
[1:27:32] get clannish about the body we need one
[1:27:34] another every one of us need one another
[1:27:37] from the littlest to the
[1:27:38] biggest from the front to the back we
[1:27:41] need each other we are baptized into one
[1:27:44] body whether we be Jews or Gentiles
[1:27:46] whether we be Bond or free and have all
[1:27:47] been made to drink into one Spirit
[1:27:50] brother BR said no wonder they said bury
[1:27:52] me in Palestine they knew the
[1:27:53] resurrection was going to be in
[1:27:54] Palestine therefore today brother you
[1:27:56] can have whatever you want to all the
[1:27:58] old cold formal religion you want to but
[1:28:02] bury me in Christ I don't want to cold
[1:28:05] for a religion I know people say we're
[1:28:07] Pentecostal I don't know how where they
[1:28:08] get that from people say we're
[1:28:09] Pentecostal I'd say let me be a little
[1:28:11] Pentecostal I don't want that old cold
[1:28:13] form of religion I don't want a religion
[1:28:15] that won't bring tears to your eyes I
[1:28:16] don't want a dead religion I don't want
[1:28:18] something that doesn't make you act in a
[1:28:19] certain way I want something that shows
[1:28:21] in your life not just in church but
[1:28:23] every day
[1:28:27] want something that'll that's heartfelt
[1:28:29] bury me in a place that's not cold and
[1:28:32] formal bury me in Christ for those that
[1:28:34] are in Christ will God bring with him in
[1:28:37] the resurrection bury me there say
[1:28:39] whatever you want to call it fanaticism
[1:28:42] whatever you want to do but just let me
[1:28:44] stay in him for those church let me stay
[1:28:48] oh church we just realized that today
[1:28:51] let me stay in him I you can call me you
[1:28:53] can call me oldfashioned you can say
[1:28:55] well brother Ben why do you give up try
[1:28:57] to give everything you can towards that
[1:28:59] Kingdom that's because I I know I've
[1:29:01] been buried with him I'm going raise
[1:29:03] with him call it what you want to but
[1:29:05] I'm coming up that day they can put me
[1:29:08] under the ground they can put me under
[1:29:09] six feet of dirt or a million feet of
[1:29:11] dirt it wouldn't matter coming up could
[1:29:14] burn my body I could be eaten by
[1:29:17] sharks I don't know how I rarely get on
[1:29:19] a boat but somehow it could happen
[1:29:24] they could burn us to believe whatever
[1:29:26] they wanted to do we' still come up amen
[1:29:29] for those that are in Christ will God
[1:29:32] bring with him we are
[1:29:34] buried we have a revelation of
[1:29:36] Resurrection that's what brother BR
[1:29:38] talks about he said that's what makes a
[1:29:39] mother get up in the morning and say and
[1:29:41] not say well you know today I have to
[1:29:43] take my kids to church in such a
[1:29:44] struggle he said but'll make her want to
[1:29:46] do it make her want to do it why because
[1:29:48] it's a he said it's a revelation of the
[1:29:50] Resurrection The Resurrection is in her
[1:29:52] heart
[1:29:54] oh church we need to get it back in our
[1:29:56] heart he didn't want the resurrection
[1:29:57] just in our head but the resurrection in
[1:29:59] our heart if the resurrection is in our
[1:30:01] heart it'll make us clap our hands in
[1:30:03] church it'll make us raise our hands to
[1:30:04] God it'll make us worship Him you won't
[1:30:06] have to have a worship leader pull and
[1:30:08] beg and push and prod but there'll be
[1:30:10] something in you why the resurrection is
[1:30:11] in your heart you've been buried with
[1:30:13] Christ you're dead to the world you
[1:30:15] don't care what people think about you
