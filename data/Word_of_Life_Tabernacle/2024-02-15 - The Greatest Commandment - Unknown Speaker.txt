spiritual or whatever they might be I pray you'd meet those needs tonight ask in your precious name amen amen to turn to Matthew chapter 22 verses 35-39 you have to bear with me I've been a little bit under the weather this week so I'm just going to try to take it as slow as I have to to get done tonight and we appreciate you being here on a Wednesday night is that uh sister D Victoria see God bless you guys good to see you here with us tonight and uh some old friends back there and and each one of you that come I I appreciate you being here and uh uh it's always a blessing to be able to come together on a Wednesday night it's good to have all our musicians back isn't it wasn't it that good song service we just enjoy the presence of the Lord we believe he's here with us because he promised that he would be yes let's go to Matthew 22:35 today everybody's focused on love and I don't want to talk about marital love or or the love of a boyfriend or girlfriend or something tonight I want to talk about uh loving God and loving one another we'll talk about the greatest commandment Matthew 22:35 says then one of them which was a lawyer asking a question tempting him and saying he says Master which is the great commandment in the law so in other words if you put them all on a list what's the greatest one which is the great commandment in the law and Jesus said unto him Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart all thy Soul all thy mind this is the first and great commandment but Jesus doesn't stop there he says and the second is like un to it Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself I pray the Lord would that his Blessing to the word you may be seated the scribes had determined that of the 613 Commandments in the Old Testament 248 were positive and 365 were negative and they had this debate among themselves of what was the great commandment what what was the one that uh would uh would be the one that uh could go at the top of the list and and it was they kind of knew what the greatest one was but they didn't know the order and so they ask Jesus trying to get him in trouble and when they ask him he responds with what's known as the Shima or Deuteronomy 64 I want us to go to that tonight Deuteronomy 6:4 and this is where jesus takes this from he says here o Israel the Lord our God is one Lord how many believe that tonight he is one Lord and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all thy soul with all thy might and these words which I command thee this day shall be in thine heart Thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children shall talk of them when thou sest in thine house when thou west by the way when thou liest down when thou risest up Thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand they shall be as frontless between Thine Eyes Thou shalt write them upon the post of thy house and on the gates and the Pharisees knew this uh they knew that this was the greatest of The Commandments but they were tempting him to see if he would agree uh with them in that they they they put it literally between their eyes they put it on their doorpost they put it uh they put it all around them they knew that this was the great commandment they put it in a a little box that they fastened on their doorpost they wrote it out and put on their felies the the pouches that they wore on their foreheads in obedience to the command to keep the word always on their minds not sure that's exactly what it meant but that's what they did so they literally kept it on their minds and and and and they they it would have been no surprise to them that Jesus named that Deuteronomy 6:4 as the greatest commandment but then he goes on he doesn't stop he said the second is likened to it or linked to it he said Thou shalt Love Thy Neighbor as thyself now I want to say tonight that unless you love God you can't love your neighbor in the right way it takes a special kind of love to be able to do it the way that God wants us to do it and so we have to love God first or we can't love our neighbor as ourselves so this comes from Leviticus 1916 which I'm going to start in verse 16 uh where he's talking about the way we treat one another and he says this he said Thou shalt not go up and down as a tail Bearer among thy people he said neither shalt thou stand against the blood of Thy Neighbor In other words he said Thou shalt not go up and down as a TA as a tail Bearer and that word is actually a peddler that's the Jewish word for for Peddler it's applied to the person who deals uh in information and so they they say something like this well did you hear what I heard and so they're always one uping somebody on information he said don't do that and then he says don't stand against the blood of Thy Neighbor uh in other words don't give a false witness he said I am the Lord so he's reminding them that that that he is God and that you shouldn't do these things so verse 17 he said Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart now this is important because it's got to be from the heart remember when Jesus we've talked about forgiveness he said if you don't forgive from the heart every man sinner or Saint right brother bam takes that and says if you don't uh if you don't forgive every man sinner or Saint said you're in danger of Hellfire right and Jesus said you can't be forgiven if you don't forgive right right and so this is what he's saying you you shall not hate thy brother in thine heart you got to forgive from the heart and we've talked about that how do you know brother Ben how do I know I've forgiven from my heart well it just don't come up anymore right you're not rehashed ing it all the time youve forgiven from your heart if you do if the memory comes up you don't dwell on it anymore you've forgiven that person so now uh so you shall not hate your brother in your heart Thou shalt no no this is kind of a strange ter Thou shalt in any wise rebuke Thy Neighbor now there's a good one and uh I think Jason was you the one that said that you didn't like getting woke up woke up in the morning by your dad is he loud in the morning is that very loud in the morning that's right so you know the scripture says don't go he said he that uh protests loudly in the morning and and worships the Lord loudly he said that'll that blesses his neighbor loudly he said it'll be a curse to him so that's that's true but in this case he's saying rebuke your neighbor all right you know the Bible says that thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy neighbor and not suffer sin upon him now what he's saying is instead of holding it in your heart and keeping it against the person take care of it deal with the problem right right and so we we want to make sure that we do that now now he said don't suffer sin upon if you see something that that is going to hurt him then talk about it and and Proverbs tells us uh the same Proverbs 27:5 he said open rebuke is better than secret love right and Jesus deals with this as well and how it operates within the church setting he's dealing specifically with the local church I hope I'm not boring you tonight but just hang with me for a little bit but in in the local church Jesus talks about this Matthew 18:16 he he talks about how he said If thy brother shall trespass against thee so somebody did something wrong to you he said go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone if he shall hear thee thou H has gain thy brother now this does not mean that if a pastor is dealing with an issue that he can't warn the Sheep just because it's something he hasn't talked to the person about you don't always get to talk directly to the person that you're dealing with and and you say well how does that work well look at Paul with the Corinthians Paul writes a letter of First Corinthians to them and he actually tells them I heard of of those of the House of Khloe that there's contentions among you he said and and then he wrote and deals with the contentions that he's just heard about how can he do that and keep this scripture it's because he's a he's a pastor in a in a fiduciary he has a responsibility to the church to deal with the issues and the things uh that are that come up like that and so that's not a hindrance to that and in doing that but it is a a a command to us that if someone in the local church if there's a problem between me and them I need to go to them directly and deal with it right go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone if he shall hear thee thou H has gained thy brother is that wonderful but if you will not hear thee then take with thee one or two more than in the mouth of two or three Witnesses every word may be established if he shall neglect to hear them tell it to the church but if you won't hear the church let him be into the as a heathen man and a Publican brandom deals with that this way and I'm doing this for a reason tonight just laying a groundwork for what we want to say he said if I knew tonight that I had an enemy I may have I perhaps have but if I do I don't know just who it is if it was I sure wouldn't go to preach and went first and made that right see if I could get it straightened up because we're not supposed to have anything against anyone I wonder if we could live that way we we don't want to have anything against anyone we just want to maintain our our Clarity we want to be able to pray through when we're called upon to pray we we want to just be have a clear uh Avenue between us and God so we don't want nothing between us and our brothers so so he says if if I could get it straightened up we're not supposed to have anything against anyone let no one if we or if anything we can do let no one have anything against us he said and it don't say if you have ought against the brother but if the brother has ought against you see go to him see if he has the ought and that way he said why we live peaceful what we're doing is fulfilling the command of Romans 12:18 where Paul says if it be possible as much as lith in you live peaceably with all men what he's telling you is that it's not possible with all men but everyone that it is possible with try to do it do your best to live at peace with all men and there will be some that you can't do it but you done your part right so I I want to continue then with Leviticus 19 cuz we didn't even get to loving your neighbor yet we got to rebuking your neighbor he said but Thou shalt not avenge nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people that's a commandment Church said but Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself he said he reminds him again I am the Lord so he's telling them if you love me he said if you love me you'll love your neighbor as yourself now who is your neighbor and this maybe take a little bit different turn than what maybe we're expecting tonight but I just want to get it in here who's your neighbor Luke 10: 25 uh Jesus again is being asked a question for the wrong reasons he lawyer stood up and tempted him saying Master what shall I do to inherit eternal life and he said unto him what is written in the law how readest thou and he answering said Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all thy soul with all thy strength with all thy mind and thy neighbor as thyself this lawyer got it right maybe he heard Jesus talk about it maybe he maybe he just repeating what he'd heard but he got it right and Jesus said to him thou has answered right this do and thou shalt live but he willing to justify himself said to Jesus who who is my neighbor on so in other words there's someone that he's thinking about that that he's not treated right and so he's trying to justify himself and saying well you know not everybody's my neighbor so Jesus answering said a certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho and fell among Thieves which stripped him of his reignment and wounded him and departed leaving him half dead and by chance there came down a certain priest that way and when he saw him he passed by on the other side and likewise a levite when he was at the place came and looked on him and passed by on the other side I wonder how many of us would pass by on the other side but look what he says but a certain Samaritan as he journeyed came where he was and when he saw him he had compassion on him I want you to notice that word compassion he said he went to him bowed up his wounds pouring in oil and wine and set him on his own beast and brought him to an end and took care of him and on the marrow when he departed he took out two pence and gave them to the host and said to him take care of him and whatsoever thou spendest more when I come again I will repay thee he said which now of these three thinkest thou now he says the levite the priest or the Samaritan which one of these three was neighbor unto him that fell among the thieves and he said he that showed Mercy on him then said Jesus unto him go and do thou likewise that's a great commandment now we believe that a prophet came in our day to bring light to the current day on the scripture how many believe that a prophet was telling us how to apply the scripture in our day because I know a lot of times when we think about Brotherly Love or when we think about loving our neighbor we think about helping the the guy on the street helping the homeless and things like that and that is a part of it that is part of what we can do but it's not our main responsibility as it as it pertains to loving our neighbor because we we were it was explained to us by a prophet what this Parable means and how it applies to our day listen to this he said Jerusalem sits on a hill Jericho sits in the valley and the Good Samaritan found a man coming from Jerusalem down to Jericho when he fell among Thieves think of it he was backsliding now think about it for a minute he was not he was not somebody who just had lost his way and lost his job although it would be good to help somebody who lost his job but here was a man who was backsliding and and I think we ought to think first of a spiritual condition of a person because everything else everything else uh will change we could give I thought of that when I went to Togo and and and went to West Africa and I've looked at the people and I could start handing out money and and I could hand out money till the end of time but I've realized that I can only do so much good if you took a billion dollars and handed it out on the street in that country tomorrow would be gone and they'd be back in the same condition so helping people brother the trip is not always just just helping the the poor man on the side of the street although that would be a good thing to do it's not always even helping your friends and relatives but it's watching for an opportunity when someone is a backslider when someone is is down when someone is not doing well spiritually to try to help them to come back to the house of God right sir good so can we look at it that way way now I wonder if we really love our neighbor I wonder if we really do and and I want I want to love my neighbor I want to be well everything don't you want to be everything God wants you to be oh that's the Cry of my heart I I want to be everything that God wants me to be I don't want for a moment to just to be a Halfway Christian I don't believe this is the hour for that as brother Stuart last time he preached it's not the time to play church it's the time to be a real Christian it's a time to it's time to go home it's time for a rapture we don't have time to play with these things things some things are more important than money amen right we got to take care of our our kids and our young people some things are more important than money some's more important than uh than even work although that's important but there's some things more important and we got to realize that now now look again brother brandom says think of it he was backside and coming from the Heavenly to the cursed he said Jericho is a cursed City Jerusalem is a blessed City he was on his road backsliding when he fell among Thieves and Rob that stripped him he said and that's when you'll fall among Thieves and robbers when you start backsliding away from God just expect the enemy to be along the road right so when you get out of church when you get away from the message of the hour when you get away from God's people you begin to Backside you begin to get among Thieves and robbers now he said you know Jesus found a man one time in a parable was on his road from Jerusalem to Jericho showed he was back siding he was going up from high going down low he was a backside and he met him on the road and an enemy had beaten him and robbed him and left him half dead I love the way a prophet didn't leave any stone unturned he said that was physically alive spiritually dead yes so here was a man he was on the side of the road and the the Good Samaritan found him he was physically alive but spiritually he was dead and when he found him in that condition he didn't just leave him in that condition but he brought him to a place he can get some help amen and so he said the priests and the Levites and so forth pass him but the Good Samaritan as Jesus taught it came picked him up poured oil and wine and take him to the end notice he poured in oil and wine oil heals but wine Burns right if you had an open wound and then you poured wine into it guess what you're going to hurt yeah but what it does what it does is it burns burns out the infection it burns out the sometimes you got to tell people stuff they don't want to hear but we're trying to burn out the infection we're not trying to hurt you we're just trying to take care of that infection we don't want it to spread so we got to pour in oil that's part of it isn't it we must have the Holy Spirit in our services we must have the Holy Spirit in our preaching but we got to pour in the wine right there's got to be a word there too of stimulation revelation now the B said there's the place I want to get to you he taken him to the in and said to the caretaker take care of him yeah he give him a couple of pennies or whatever it was to pay his way and said now if he needs any more just go ahead and take care of him I'll make it right when I come and he said now you Shepherds God give you the spirit and the word to take care of these wounded ones that's been brought in and I've thought brother brother JT what what do I have to help help people with because that's the desire of my heart I want to help people but what's the best way I can help people the best thing I can do to help people although I will give to people and do and try to do the best I can in that way but the best way we can help people is with the things that we were given to help people with and what I was given as a pastor to help people with is the spirit and the word right that's what I was given come on that's the two pence aren't you glad for a prophet in this day yeah look he said it's two pence now he said if you need any more he said he'll take care of that when he comes so just feed those Sheep amen oh I hope I take that as a command tonight just feed those sheep that's my job if you want to help people now now now watch how the Good Samaritan helps them he doesn't help them by he doesn't help him by by taking him in necessarily into his own home he doesn't help him by uh by getting married to him he doesn't help him by uh by by giving him money he doesn't help him by doing any those things how does he help him he takes him to the place where he knows there's a place an in that's the church take him to the church and let the pastor pour in the oil and the wine let the pastor take the two pence of Spirit and the word and help him out see what what we're doing we we ought to we ought to be like that little girl that went out there remember the little girl that got got kidnapped by the Assyrians and she gets out by herself and and she comes to the house of a man named non the leper and she gets down there all by herself but she had a testimony she said would God you went to my church she said if you were back in my country we have a prophet where where you there's healing there's a place there and brother brand said that she invited him to church and that's the way we ought to be even at work or wherever we're at we ought to say we have a church where there's a love for people and a love for God there's a place there where you can go and you can get the help that you need yes amen see so many times we want to do it ourselves and we try to we try to meddle in so many things in people's lives and it just not a good idea just bring them to the church bring them to the pastor let him take care of it take care of him now he said we can only as a Good Samaritan bring them to the end and the Lord told the inkeeper take care of him give him so many pence and said if he wants anything give it to him when I return I'll make it good with you he said I'm sure God will do that when he makes it good with his pastors at the coming of the Lord Jesus there's coming a reckoning day and I'm glad for that I'm glad for that I'm glad there's coming a day look brother brand was at the end of a meeting at the end of a meeting and he said a Good Samaritan come by and poured oil in the wound he's talking about it the healing Revival aren't you glad for a good meeting don't you like a good meeting when you can feel the presence of God and the Good Samaritan comes back by she glad for a good church service when you just feel the presence of God and a Good Samaritan comes by but now he poured oil in the wound he said but he's took you now and he wants to go to one of the ends here the closest to you he said he's done paid the pastor to take care of you I like this he said he's paid the pastor to take care of you he's paid he received the Holy Ghost got blessings of God and health and Revelation he can just feed your soul yes sir do we believe it tonight that's the best thing we could do for people is get them to the house of God and if they won't hear the word they can't get help right brother B said how you going to get washed if you won't sit under the spout right you can't be washed if you won't sit under the word yeah and so but that's the best thing we can do to help people he said so you come down and join one of the churches it'll be the best thing you can do to keep your spirit fed and moving on Amen good he said again remember the Good Samaritan that found the man wounded he brought him to the end that's the church and he gave the man there two pence and told him if you needed anymore he'd pay him when he come so he's got two pence he's able to doctor you up if he's a man of God you believe that tonight yes if he's a man of God that stands on the word of God he's got what God give him and today people want to do away with preaching want to do away with pastors but a prophet of God said that if he's a man of God he can take care of you he's got what God give him the spirit and the word is that right he said how is it we're to Worship in spirit and in truth and the word is the truth good again the said well now I want to ask you what about you when you get all messed up in trouble don't you go to your pastor is that right you should do it now again I've never want to depry I don't want to be a part of your business but if you if you need me that's what I'm here for that's what I'm here for if you need me you got a question to ask I I'm the one to ask the question because there's something God's given me that responsibility and I may not always be right but God did give me the spirit and the word to help you out and and I trust that I trust that you got confidence enough to be able to do that now he said if you get in trouble you should go to your brother and tell him say brother I did something wrong I shouldn't have did that I pray you to help me now to pray through till I get over this thing or or help me in my troubles he said isn't that the scriptural way to do it well that's because he's your pastor he's your Shepherd he's the one who gives the food out to you to eat and he knows how to feed his sheep that God and the Holy Spirit has made him oversteer over the flock to watch over them and take care of them that's what he's for oh I tell you what we ought to have confidence in the men of God that God sets in front of us right that that we're going to hear something that'll help us when when they preach the word of God and and brother Bram talked about how if a pastor sees a sheep eating Loco weed he said he'll he'll drive him away from it yeah because he he'll Jerk it away from him as quickly as possible he said and a a real Pastor a real servant of Christ will be a poor example of Christ see the sheep eat something that's going to drive him away or make him an outlaw before God a breaker of his word a breaker of his Commandments you shouldn't do that you should watch that very closely listen that's my responsibility and I've got to do that but I want to help people in the right way I want to love my neighbor don't you want to love your neighbor if you want to love your neighbor bring them to the spirit and the word bring them to the message of the hour I believe the prophet in our day was given was given two pence I believe he had the spirit in the word to give to us aren't you glad for that amen I believe we're in the end I believe we're in a place where we can be healed that's good we want to help people in the right way in Jude 20 let's look at this now Jude verse 20 but you beloved building up yourselves on your Most Holy Faith praying in the Holy Ghost keep yourselves in the love of God looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life yeah now look so he said keep yourself in the love of God now he tells you how to do that now love God love your neighbor he's going to tell you how to love your neighbor or some have compassion making a difference you believe compassion makes a difference others save with fear pulling them out of the fire now he does he's not saying save them by making them fearful that's not what he's saying at all he's saying you be afraid you have reverence you have fear because there's some things you can't be a part of you can't be a partaker of some have compassion making a difference others saved with fear pulling them out of the fire listen if you get in fire you're flamable too right so if someone's in fire you got to pull them carefully out of the fire cuz you can't do them any good if you're in the fire with them so he said pull them out of the fire hating even the Garment spotted by the flesh make sure you don't become a partaker in these things laying in the gutter with them doesn't help them the Good Samaritan didn't lay down there with him and and that's the modern politics of the day let's just lay down there with them and be a part of what they're doing no I believe anybody can be saved but you got to want to be saved you got to be willing to go to the end and get something from God Amen now again Galatians 61 do you love the word I I just have to go always go back to the scriptures and to the message of the hour it's all I've got it's all I've got it's the spirit and the word and I trust it's enough for us amen if a man be overtaken in a fault you which are spiritual restore such a one in the spirit of meekness now watch considering thyself lest thou also be tempted and now watch verse Two Bear you one another's burdens and so fulfill law of Christ that word burdens there is varos or weights something too heavy to carry alone there are things we need help with right and it's okay to ask for help when you need help that's what we're here for it's okay to ask for help when you need help something too heavy to carry a loone verse three for if a man think himself to be something when he's nothing he deceiveth himself now watch but but now he kind of turns it around he said but let every man prove his own work and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone and not in another for every man shall bear his own burden now that seems like a direct contradiction but in the original the two words are are completely different words the words translated B the word translated burdens in verse two is a completely different word from the word translated burden in verse 5 which the word in verse five means a a foron a pack carried by a soldier so there's something that you were designed to carry right there there's a burden of life that you were designed to carry and you can do it if you're a a husband you can be the right kind of a husband if you're a wife if you're a a child if you're a pastor whatever the burden it is of Life you've been given see before they send a soldier out to carry a pack they make sure they they they they fill it up and I've always wondered how in the world could they carry them 50 or 70 pound packs on their back I'm sure you've done that brother the bill and I've always wonder why in the world would they give them something that heavy to carry but before they sent them out somebody else carried it before you did yes right somebody else had already carried that pack so God don't give you more than you can bear so there's something you can do in your life you don't have to spend all of your life in the church just having people take care of you right there's a pack that you can carry there's something that you can do and so he said every man shall bear his own fortos his own fortune his own his own pack yeah right God's given you but he said my yoke is easy and my burden is light aren't you glad for that he said now now I want you to we want to be good to people don't we yeah we want to make sure we have the kind of love that that that that sticks give them something that's good yeah give them something that's right cuz we want to help people but brother brandham talked to a man named Merlin anthon and I know a little bit about this story because uh my former Pastor was personal Friends With Merlin anthon and he told me about it and brother Bram didn't know him at the time but he speaks to him directly and brother Anthony wants to be ordained as a minister in the message and he come from a group called The Salvation Army that's the ones that have the kettles and ring the bells you know outside of Walmart and brother Bandon tells him this he said now brother we know that you're coming from a great group of people Salvation Army they're great people he said but the Salvation Army does a great work out on the street we can say nothing against the Nazarene the Pentecostal Church the Salvation Army or any of them he said they're our Brethren but you see we believe we're carriers of a great message for this very hour that we're living in we've got something more to do right we've got something greater to get yeah than the Salvation Army does they do a great work we were talking about St Judes and what a great work they do for kids earlier they do a great work and if you got extra to give them that's fine but there's something about what we do as Believers we're carrying a great message there's only so many other us so we try to give and I get questions sometimes and we've got our mission report now on the back wall and our our yearly report and that's what made me think of this as we were going through that and you know we give most of our our money and our attention towards the ministry and towards bringing people in I give away more than I keep myself but I try to give it to foreign missions and I try to give it to people coming in and and and ministers that come in and help you there's a reason for that I'd love to pay all your bills I I'd love to be able to do that I I I if you have a need I you know I'm not afraid to help you I'd love to help you but but that's not primarily what I'm called to do primarily what I'm called to do is pack this message that's my that's my burden sir and that's what he told Merlin anthon to do he said he said we're not called to what Salvation Army is he says we're carriers of a great message he said you want to do that with us and brother Anthony said amen amen right now something interesting about brother Anthony he's gone to be with the Lord now he's a good man but way I understand is he never did really get over that he was always trying to always trying to do the Salvation Army thing and it just don't work in the message of the hour we're doing something different we're called to a different age they have their place and there will be rewards for that and there will be blessings for that but God called us to something else we carry a message Jesus at the pool of Bethesda and I want to get to this before I close and we'll close if you just bear with me for a moment Jesus at Bethesda brother B said he had compassion and brother Brandon was challenged by the fact that he didn't heal everybody and Jesus was challenged by the fact that he didn't heal everybody and he said in fact at his trial they brought this up against Jesus that he was uh brother brandom said that they brought this up that well you went down to Bethesda and didn't heal the sick but he did heal one man right at the pool of Bethesda but they said well you had no compassion or you would have healed them all but brother brand said people don't know what compassion is all right they mix filo love with agapo love he said it's two different loves altogether right remember when Peter and John were at the gate beautiful remember they were Pentecostal preachers they didn't have any money yeah right that's how we know they were Pentecostal preachers so they're walking down by the gate beautiful and and when they got down there and the man is out there for the purpose of getting money that he that's how he makes his living there's nothing wrong with that people give him money that's a a good thing but they had something more to give him right we want to help people when we can help them right we should we have responsibility but we also have a greater responsibility not just to help people but to carry this message and you've got inside of you eternal life how many believe that tonight we have eternal life inside of us and what we what should we be doing what should our primary job be Peter looks at the man and he fastened his eyes upon him with John and said look on us heyen he gave he un to them expecting to receive something of them and Peter said Silver and Gold Have I None but I have something I can give you and I want to tell you tonight I don't have much silver and gold but I have something I can give you in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk amen we do have we do have the power of the of the resurrection power of Jesus Christ living among us do you believe that right amen now we want perfect love don't we we have to have perfect love if we're going to ever go over there right but what is that it's love God love God love your neighbor now watch 1 John 4:10 says hearing his love not that we loved God in other words we didn't love him first but that he loved us and sent his son to be the propitiation for our sins in other words he took my place that's the gospel he said beloved if God so loved us we ought also to love one another no man has seen God at any time if we love one another God dwelleth in us and his love now watch is perfected yeah in us that's right his love is perfected in us that's perfect love if you go down to verse 16 he said we have known and believed the love that God hath to us God is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God and God in him herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world there is no fear in love but perfect love casteth out fear because fear hath torment he that fearth is not made perfect in love right so fear is Phobos or Terror there's no Terror in love we don't we don't do what we do because we're going to hell or we're afraid we're going to go to hell we do what we do because we love God because he first loved us so uh brother randam taught us that then that this perfect love is something more than just human love it's a goo love or it's something it's something higher than FAL love that would cause you to just give a handout to your neighbor but it's something higher than that and actually even the way we love our neighbor is even higher than just giving them a handout but but it's giving them eternal life amen it's taking them down to the end and letting them see that there's somebody who can help them oh I trust we have that kind of Love Tonight now look brother Brown said anything that had a beginning has an end those things which have not a beginning has has an end he said did you ever think of that God the Great Master rainbow in the skies he said with the seven spirits of God R perfect love yeah he said after that comes feel your love from a goo to ailio love he said that's the love that you have for your wife I think about that I know it's Valentine's Day and everybody's ready to get out of here and go to the restaurant Ain no restaurant's open after we get done but go to McDonald's and have your Valentine's Day at McDonald's I guess but but I was thinking about this because he said that's the love you have for your wife is filio love there's a higher love than that and he explained it this way which seems almost incredible he said if some man would insult her you'd shoot his brains out that's fio love right don't try it right because a lot of us we we we have to have FAL love right we need that but we also need something more he said see because it creates a jealousy that's FAL love secondary love he said and then like if you come on down from that it gets perverted it comes then comes lust for another man's wife he said then comes filth it becomes perverted he said but all this kind of love had a beginning right it was perverted but when that real genuine love of God that I've been talking about comes into the human being by the new birth being born again it had no beginning all and it'll have no end right so even in our marriages there's something higher that keeps us together than even filio love right there's a higher commitment oh my there's a higher thing that keeps us together we're held together by the word by the love of God because we love God we love our wives because we love God we love our neighbor because we love God we spread the gospel are you with me now because we love God love flows out from us because we love God we give forgiveness we I don't forgive you because I love you I forgive you because I love God and that makes me love you right so everything flows from that genuine love of God it comes from that perfect love yes so why he said the second commandment was like the first one it was linked to it look he said but when this real genuine love of God comes a human being by the new birth being born again you realize if you've been born again you have this kind of love that I'm talking about why because you've been made a partaker of the divine nature you said but it's not showing through me you just got to yield to it you got to give into it let it grow in your life let it become what you just give into it just surrender to it it's there if you've been born again if you've got had the baptism of the Holy Ghost the true baptism of the Holy Ghost in your life you've been sealed by God you have the token you have this kind of love he said but it has no beginning it'll have no end you are then a Son of God and a daughter of God your affections are in things above right gny said feel your love would make you shoot a man for insulting your wife gapo love would make you pray for his lost soul he said that's the difference yes God Bel love makes you want what is best for others yeah not always what's best for you right right tell you you young ladies we talked about dating and relationships on Sunday night if you want a man that treats you right make sure it's a man that'll put you first and and the man that'll put you first if if it wasn't right for you to be married he wouldn't marry you because he loves you more than that right brother brand said you have to love somebody to the point where if you believe they'd be happier with somebody else you'd let them go when you have that kind of a love that means you've you've tapped into something else yeah and that's what we want yeah because we live in an age when when people don't stay together no more people don't love each other anymore Valentine's Day is just a you know it's a it's a madeup holiday anyway but they're all made up holidays our birthdays are made up right so they're all made up but but it's just a made up holiday but I'll say this you know we we know the kind of love you say well I don't have a valentine but you know the kind my mom's been kind of put out because no one takes her out for Valentine's Day but but you know what so that's just an advertisement out there I guess if somebody wants to do that make sure it's right she has a son who's a pastor but but I'll say this you know you may feel bad about that but you know what kind of love a lot of people don't know are you with me tonight you know what kind of love a lot of people don't know about it's the love of Christ it's perfect love sir Soom tells us as musicians come tonight brandom tells us he said it'll take perfect love thus saith the Lord it'll take perfect love to put you in that place yeah don't you want to go now he said when he got there it was a different kind of love it wasn't it wasn't a love from a husband to a wife like we have now but it was a different kind of love you said it was far above anything we could ever think about you couldn't even describe it he said but it'll take perfect love to put you in that place that's all there was there oh what a blessing he said so whatever you do oh this is this is my my exhortation to the church tonight does this come on my heart actually last week a put these things together I the exhortation was whatever you do you lay aside everything else until you're so filled with the love of God you can even love those who hate you perfect love amen would we would we bow our heads together maybe you could pray that way Lord Jesus won't you perfect your love in me that's how he said love would be perfected John said is perfected in us and perfect love brother brand said real compassion passion was to do the will of the father so I love God first put him first want to do his will first I want things to be right first then if I really love somebody that'll flow out of that so there'll never be a well I'll just do this you know God will forgive me no it'll be a perfect love towards God did you just make that your prayer tonight that's my prayer Lord perfect your love in me if I'm lacking in love if I come across his heart har I pray that way myself as a pastor Lord perfect your love in me I I don't want to I don't want to cuz I know I realize that make decisions that that that Souls hang in the balance just just what to preach and what to say across the pulpit can can can change someone's trajectory of life and I I don't want to say the wrong thing Lord Jesus perfect your love in my life let me have real love let me have perfect love real compassion so I can really help somebody if I find the man by the side of the road let me let me take him to the end so he can get some help let me let me know the right place to go let me do things by the word perfect your love in me heavenly father that's my prayer
