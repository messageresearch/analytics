[43:31] get out of here quickly my timer has
[43:32] already started we have a baptism this
[43:34] afternoon and uh we're sure thankful for
[43:36] the young people I I I was blessed last
[43:39] week I got done preaching and I I was
[43:40] feeling the blues and I was sitting
[43:42] there at the house and I got this letter
[43:45] sent to me and uh I ain't going to lie I
[43:47] started crying a little bit and uh
[43:50] little young lady asked me to baptize
[43:52] her so we're going to do that right
[43:53] after the service tonight and we love
[43:55] the Lord Lord don't we and we're
[43:57] servants to the people that's all we
[43:59] were that's all we are and if we can get
[44:00] ourselves out of the way we can we can
[44:02] hopefully help the people in some way so
[44:04] you're not in this alone but 2
[44:05] Chronicles chapter 20 and he said
[44:08] hearken ye all of Judah and ye
[44:10] inhabitants of Jerusalem thou and Thou
[44:12] King Jehoshaphat thus saith the Lord
[44:15] unto you be Not Afraid nor dismayed by
[44:17] reason of this great multitude don't be
[44:20] scared of the crowds that are against
[44:22] you for the battle is not yours but it's
[44:25] God's and you may be seated tonight may
[44:27] the Lord add His blessings to the word
[44:30] and I was thinking about different
[44:34] people in the Bible and what they went
[44:35] through and you know you feel alone
[44:38] sometimes we just feel alone sometimes
[44:39] you feel like you're everything you're
[44:40] doing you're just by yourself you know
[44:43] uh sometimes you feel like you're the
[44:44] only person that's worshiping sometimes
[44:46] you feel like you're the only one saying
[44:47] amen sometimes you sometimes you just
[44:49] feel alone in life you don't feel like
[44:51] you got friends anymore you ever been
[44:53] there sometimes you just feel like
[44:56] everybody's against you but do you know
[44:58] you've always got somebody who's walking
[45:00] with you he's always in your corner and
[45:03] he's the greatest champion I know he's
[45:04] never lost a battle he's never left you
[45:07] alone in battle and he never will why
[45:09] because he said I will never leave you
[45:11] nor forsake you but I'll be with you and
[45:13] even in you I tell you what he's so
[45:15] close that brother brandom said he's
[45:17] closer than your right arm he's always
[45:19] near and he's always there and I thank
[45:21] the Lord that we don't have to look to a
[45:23] god that's that's a far off or or in
[45:25] another in another world but he's right
[45:27] here with us he's right here and Among
[45:29] Us you say I need God in my service he's
[45:31] right here today I believe God is here
[45:33] to do the impossible here in the service
[45:36] tonight all we have to do is say Lord I
[45:38] need you to help me and he's right there
[45:40] ready to help Lord I just need to get
[45:42] myself out of the way so I can see you
[45:44] and I heard over the weekend a brother
[45:46] talking about the angels that would
[45:47] encamp around those that would believe
[45:49] him and he said you can't see them but
[45:51] they're all around you all you have to
[45:52] do is call on them and they're there to
[45:54] help you I believe that's what we need
[45:56] to do tonight let the fear just fall
[45:58] away and let the let the doubts just
[46:00] fall out of the way and let's take God
[46:02] at his word and be a mighty Army in this
[46:04] day that can rise up and say I'm not in
[46:06] this alone you're not in this alone
[46:09] you're not by yourself I don't care how
[46:11] you feel about it you're not in this
[46:14] alone brother B talks about a Lily and I
[46:17] got to thinking about a lily you know
[46:19] when it's down there in the mud no doubt
[46:21] that Lily thinks it's all by itself it's
[46:24] never going to become nothing right it's
[46:26] just under the mud and and it it's never
[46:28] seen the daylight yet it don't even know
[46:30] what it looks like it don't even know
[46:33] why it's growing like it is but there's
[46:35] something inside of that seed that will
[46:37] soon become a beautiful Lily and there's
[46:40] something on the inside of it that's
[46:41] making it beautiful that's the way
[46:43] Christians are a lot of times we don't
[46:45] feel like we're ever going to become
[46:46] anything but there's something on the
[46:48] inside that says keep pressing the
[46:50] battle don't give up now there's there's
[46:52] too much ahead of you to stop
[46:54] now and so so the Lily just keeps going
[46:57] he said he said it gets to itself when
[46:59] it gets to the light he said when it
[47:01] gets to the light it blooms out and it's
[47:02] the most beautiful flower there is
[47:04] anywhere that's what a lily is I say
[47:06] that's what a Christian is when you
[47:08] finally get to the light when you
[47:10] finally see what God has done for you
[47:13] when you finally can lay down your doubt
[47:14] just long enough say you know what I can
[47:16] see that God is walking with me I can
[47:19] look back on the trials of my life and
[47:21] say he was there all the time oh come on
[47:23] somebody he was always there you say
[47:26] I've been in some pretty bad places I
[47:28] don't care how far you've been I don't
[47:29] care how low down you've been God was
[47:31] there the whole
[47:33] time think about Daniel he was in a
[47:36] lion's den and there was no hope of a
[47:39] man coming out of that Lion's Den with
[47:40] some hungry Lions down there but there
[47:43] was somebody else in the den with him
[47:45] think about the Hebrew children there
[47:47] was three of them cast into the fire but
[47:49] let me tell you something there was a
[47:50] fourth man there to deliver them out of
[47:53] the fire and did you know every
[47:54] situation you ever put in God is always
[47:57] there to deliver
[47:58] you brother bam talks about the word he
[48:01] said the word will always deliver his
[48:03] people always the word will deliver his
[48:06] people always and Christ is the word in
[48:09] this day so if you can just get Christ
[48:11] on the inside of your church if you
[48:13] could just accept the person of Jesus
[48:15] Christ that he's come and he sent his
[48:17] Spirit to the church today so that he
[48:19] could lead you he could guide you he
[48:21] said he was a comforter to you oh I hope
[48:23] you're hearing me tonight you say these
[48:25] are just words but it's a reality to the
[48:29] believer brother B goes on down he said
[48:32] he said he said that Lily he said it
[48:33] comes from the dirt of the Earth from
[48:35] the filth that's where the jewels are
[48:36] found wrapped up out there in this gold
[48:38] state of the nation where you find gold
[48:40] down in the dirt where do you find
[48:41] rubies and jewels down in the dirt he
[48:43] said that's where we all come from but
[48:46] and the world here he said he said it
[48:48] sees here he said I'm a prospector what
[48:49] does a prospector do he hunts for gold
[48:52] and when he does he shines it and he
[48:54] beats it and he smelts it he gets it
[48:55] ready that's what US preachers are
[48:57] trying to do today we're not trying to
[48:58] just make some big name or or or I know
[49:01] who I know this is so and so and and
[49:03] he's my best friend and and I know this
[49:05] preacher I've been to his church it
[49:06] don't matter I tell you what we're
[49:08] trying to do is trying to find some gold
[49:10] that we can beat try to polish up and
[49:12] not to beat the people but we can bring
[49:13] it into the house of God and let the
[49:15] Holy Spirit go to work on it not
[49:17] something I can do brother Stuart can't
[49:19] do it brother Ben can't do it your
[49:20] pastor can't do it but God can change
[49:23] the hearts of the young people he can
[49:24] change the heart of the old people he
[49:26] can make a hardened heart soft
[49:29] again because God can still do the
[49:33] impossible I don't care it's the hardest
[49:35] person you've ever seen a person that
[49:37] looks like they've gone too far God can
[49:39] still change that person and bring them
[49:41] back God can still make something out of
[49:43] nothing at
[49:45] all he said uh it goes on down here I
[49:48] got to skip a lot of this y'all cuz I'm
[49:50] long- winded and and I got to I got to
[49:52] get out of here in time to have a
[49:53] baptism so I'm I'm working on it he said
[49:56] 'oh there it was he said he's talking
[49:57] about the three whober children here and
[49:59] he said uh there it was he said it was a
[50:01] fiery furnace he said and under the
[50:03] trial under a test they held true to the
[50:05] end he said but God was there just in a
[50:08] spare of a moment oh yeah you believe
[50:11] that he's been there in a spare of a
[50:12] moment for you when you should have died
[50:14] when you should have went too far but
[50:16] you could only go so far because God was
[50:19] there to bring you back he said there he
[50:21] was he said there's the furnace he said
[50:23] but he said he delivered him he said he
[50:25] knew that they were prayed up their sins
[50:26] were confessed he know they had met
[50:28] every requirement and yet he seemed to
[50:30] be silent he's only silent to test you I
[50:34] said he's only silent to test you are
[50:36] you going to call out on the name of God
[50:38] or are you going to say well this trial
[50:39] got me no sir a Believer rest in the
[50:42] promises of God a Believer will grab
[50:44] hold of that promise and say you know
[50:45] what I can't be defeated because I'm in
[50:48] God's Army and the general Captain the
[50:51] Great Captain has never lost a battle
[50:53] he's leading me he's guiding me he'll
[50:55] always be with
[50:56] me don't ever think you're alone you're
[51:00] not alone Daniel and I I I I was talking
[51:03] about Daniel there brother BR says
[51:04] Daniel was tested for the worship of one
[51:05] true God he was tested for that and you
[51:08] will be
[51:08] too come on somebody every son that
[51:12] cometh to God must first be tested and
[51:14] tried you've got to be
[51:16] tested he said but in the face of
[51:19] difficulties he stood the test he said
[51:21] and what did God do after it looked like
[51:23] the chips were down for him as they say
[51:25] he said he didn't know what to do they
[51:27] was going to feed him to the Lions he
[51:28] said but Daniel stayed true to the test
[51:30] that there is one true God and he
[51:32] possessed the Gate of his enemy and God
[51:35] had closed the mouth of the Lions I
[51:37] think that's what we need to do tonight
[51:38] quit giving into the devil and possess
[51:41] your Gates possess your promises of God
[51:43] tonight because God is not trying to
[51:46] kill you but the devil is when that
[51:48] doubt comes in and says well I'm not
[51:49] good enough that's not God telling you
[51:51] that that's the devil trying to tell you
[51:53] I'm not good enough I can't never preach
[51:55] the gospel because you know what I I've
[51:57] got a past I tell you what every one of
[51:59] you's got a past but God knows the
[52:01] future and God is more than able to
[52:04] raise of these Stones children of
[52:06] Abraham he's more than able to do
[52:08] whatever he wants because he's
[52:10] God it's man that limits God but God is
[52:13] Unlimited in his power God is Unlimited
[52:16] in his mercy God is Unlimited in his
[52:18] restoring process he's Unlimited in what
[52:21] he wants to do he can do whatever he
[52:23] wants why because he's God
[52:26] and if you ever get the Revelation that
[52:28] he's with you and he's in you then you
[52:30] know I'm not alone in this journey I
[52:33] don't care how dark the nights get I
[52:35] don't care how hard the days get God has
[52:37] never left one of his children you can
[52:40] look through the Bible and every time a
[52:41] test would come when Jonah got in the
[52:43] whales py when it got so bad come on
[52:45] somebody you say we've heard all this
[52:47] before well I wish you to remind
[52:48] yourself once in a while because
[52:50] sometimes we get so defeated we act like
[52:52] we can't do nothing about it sometimes
[52:54] we get those so defeated we just go
[52:56] around and we have the wowy wowy blues
[52:58] they say and you get so bad and so
[53:00] defeated you can't raise your hand in
[53:02] church no more you can't shout in church
[53:04] no more why because you're living in a a
[53:06] defeated state but if you'll ever give
[53:08] the trials to Jesus then you can shout a
[53:11] little bit and say you know what there's
[53:12] no condemnation holding me back no more
[53:14] there's no trials holding me down the
[53:16] chains have been broken the locks have
[53:18] been on unlocked tonight why because God
[53:21] is still in the
[53:22] business of setting people free
[53:26] don't let that denominational Spirit
[53:28] hold you back and say you can't Worship
[53:29] in church no more that's the devil
[53:32] trying to get after
[53:35] you God inhabits the Praises of his
[53:38] people so we need to praise him when we
[53:40] come to the house of
[53:41] God I said we need to praise him when we
[53:44] come to the house of God God doesn't
[53:46] want you to sit here and not praise him
[53:48] did you know he wouldn't be God Without
[53:50] You praising
[53:51] him you were created so that he could
[53:55] have somebody to worship
[53:57] him God Made You for him he's not going
[54:00] to leave you now he wanted you to come
[54:03] on somebody he wanted you to worship him
[54:05] so bad that he made a human being that
[54:07] he knew would fall and he would have to
[54:09] give his own son's life for but he made
[54:12] you so that he could be worshiped so why
[54:15] can't we worship him tonight why can't
[54:17] we give him everything we got why
[54:19] because he set me free from bondage he
[54:21] set me free from Spirits that I thought
[54:23] was going to take me out he set me free
[54:25] so why can't I be free enough to say
[54:28] thank you Jesus why can't I be free
[54:30] enough to raise my hands when the Holy
[54:32] Spirit tells me to why why why are we
[54:35] held back because of false teaching in
[54:37] the
[54:38] pulpits the devil coming in saying you
[54:40] can't shout no more binding the people
[54:43] Satan has come to bind the people but
[54:45] God come to loose
[54:48] you that's what we get when you start
[54:50] taking a man's complex as Doctrine when
[54:53] you start taking a man's idea as
[54:54] Doctrine I say go back to the word of
[54:56] God I say go back to the word of God and
[54:59] let the word of God change the way you
[55:01] worship well that was free it wasn't in
[55:04] my notes but I think too often we we we
[55:07] get kind of in this way of thinking that
[55:10] you know somebody's going to criticize
[55:11] me for the way I worship they're going
[55:12] to criticize you no matter what worship
[55:15] God they're going to criticize you for
[55:18] being too quiet or too loud worship God
[55:21] they're going to criticize you for the
[55:23] way your music sounds I said worship God
[55:26] on the instruments I say worship god
[55:28] with your hands I said worship god with
[55:30] your voice why because you're not in
[55:32] this alone let's give him some praise
[55:34] for
[55:36] that God didn't call us just to be
[55:39] another church if I wanted to go to a
[55:41] dead Church I'd go to a Baptist Church
[55:43] but it's a Living Word making the people
[55:46] a living prde
[55:49] amen see we're married to the groom the
[55:52] bride and the groom are
[55:54] one you're never alone you two have
[55:57] become one oh yeah we have become one we
[56:00] are him oh I hope you see that tonight
[56:03] we are him so how could you ever be
[56:06] alone when you are a very part of
[56:09] God you are a part of the body of God
[56:12] doesn't matter what people try to tell
[56:14] you I'll tell you another one Joshua
[56:17] brother said a great leader and only two
[56:20] of them that went to the promised land
[56:21] he said Joshua and Caleb they come to a
[56:23] place called Kadesh which was the center
[56:25] of the world at that time and he said it
[56:28] was a judgment seat and he said they
[56:29] sent out 12 Spies to look at the land
[56:31] and 12 of them come back 10 of them said
[56:33] oh it's too much of a job we just
[56:35] couldn't do it it wasn't people we look
[56:37] like grasshoppers beside of them there
[56:39] was Giants in the land don't you know
[56:41] there's some Giants in the land today we
[56:43] call them intellectual Giants we call
[56:45] them giants that are trying to bind the
[56:47] people well come on somebody I know some
[56:49] people don't like shouting in church and
[56:50] people responding in church well get
[56:52] over it because you're not worshiping me
[56:55] you're not worshiping brother Ben you're
[56:57] worshiping
[57:01] God and who's to say worshiping God is
[57:06] wrong on 10 of them said it's too much
[57:09] what did Joshua do he stealed the people
[57:12] and said wait a
[57:14] minute I heard this said one time that
[57:16] Joshua stealed the people and that meant
[57:17] he had him be quiet and church oh he
[57:20] stealed the people because they were
[57:21] saying we can't do it we can't do it no
[57:23] he was trying to tell them no you're not
[57:24] in this
[57:26] alone greater is he that is in you than
[57:29] the Giants on the other
[57:30] side he said wait a minute I like this
[57:34] we are more than able no matter how
[57:37] little I he said or how much in the
[57:40] minority come on somebody we may not be
[57:42] the biggest group in the world but we've
[57:44] got power behind us we've got authority
[57:46] to walk all over the devil in this day
[57:49] he said he said I don't care how much it
[57:51] was he said he he said what was he doing
[57:53] he was standing true to that promise he
[57:55] said I give you this land but you've got
[57:57] to fight for every inch of it and you're
[58:00] going to have to fight the Devils of
[58:01] intellect today that tell you that we
[58:03] just need a teaching meeting and we
[58:04] don't need the move of the spirit no
[58:06] more I said we got to fight that devil
[58:08] because every possession every promise
[58:11] is yours if you need a blessing in the
[58:13] house of God I say go into the house of
[58:15] God and get a blessing because Jesus is
[58:17] with you and where he is there's a lot
[58:21] of
[58:23] noise I know people like it quiet
[58:25] sometimes that's good you know hey i'
[58:27] I've been in Services where the
[58:28] quietness of the Holy Spirit comes in
[58:30] and it blesses me more than the shouting
[58:32] I'm not against that but I think
[58:34] sometimes when you start getting tired
[58:36] on a Sunday afternoon and you start
[58:39] feeling a little bit blue and you start
[58:41] feeling like you just can't take your
[58:42] land I think it's time that you shout
[58:44] and give God praise because in the
[58:46] valley it's time to give him some
[58:50] Praise In The Valley he restores my soul
[58:54] when it looks like I shouldn't be here
[58:56] he's restored me anyway because God did
[58:59] the restoring it wasn't a man that did
[59:01] it but God said you know what that's one
[59:04] of mine down there that's Danel Daniel
[59:06] down there that's my servant I'm not
[59:08] going to leave him down there to be
[59:09] Lion's food no I'm going to bring him
[59:11] out of that why because I want to show
[59:13] my Mercy to him I want to show my
[59:15] goodness to him he wants to do the same
[59:17] for you but you know what he'll stand
[59:19] there and he'll let you go so far and
[59:21] he'll let you do things that you're like
[59:23] you know what I'm I'm just going to go
[59:24] out in the world I'm going to backslide
[59:25] but did you know if God has ever gotten
[59:27] a hold of you then he'll let you go so
[59:29] far and then all of a sudden you feel
[59:31] that tug on your heart I just can't go
[59:33] no
[59:34] farther he was there all the time or you
[59:37] could have went as far as you wanted to
[59:38] that's right that's right he never left
[59:41] you alone I want you to know tonight
[59:43] church when you leave here and you have
[59:45] to face work on Monday morning you're
[59:46] not facing it alone when you leave here
[59:49] and you have to face Devils that are
[59:51] going to try to come against you and the
[59:53] stand you've taken for the message of
[59:55] the hour you're not in this alone I said
[59:57] we're not fighting this battle by
[59:58] ourselves because the battle is not
[1:00:01] yours but it's God's
[1:00:03] battle when a lustful Spirit would try
[1:00:06] to come against you and try to take you
[1:00:09] young people out you're not in this
[1:00:11] alone you can't fight this battle on
[1:00:14] your own well come on somebody I said
[1:00:16] you can't fight this battle on your own
[1:00:19] but Jesus is with me when the storm
[1:00:21] clouds gather I I like the song he said
[1:00:23] he's standing by your
[1:00:25] side I love it why because he said I'll
[1:00:29] never leave you did you know that's a
[1:00:31] promise to you when I see these young
[1:00:33] people getting baptized I think we've
[1:00:35] got four or five to do over the next
[1:00:36] couple weeks when these young people are
[1:00:38] getting baptized did you know when they
[1:00:40] get the holy spirit in their heart
[1:00:42] they're no longer in this
[1:00:45] alone because the comforter is going to
[1:00:47] come and he's going to lead him and
[1:00:48] guide him do they still need child
[1:00:50] training yes sir do they still need to
[1:00:52] be taught things yes do they still need
[1:00:53] teaching yes but they're not in this
[1:00:55] alone and when they get old they won't
[1:00:58] depart from it oh they might try to
[1:00:59] stray but they're going to come back
[1:01:01] because something was placed in their
[1:01:03] hearts at a young age and they can't get
[1:01:05] away from
[1:01:07] it you believe that tonight we've got to
[1:01:11] possess the Gate of our
[1:01:13] enemy and the word I think I said this
[1:01:16] but the word delivers the people I read
[1:01:18] that quote last night I didn't I didn't
[1:01:20] keep it but but there's a word here
[1:01:23] today that is a message of
[1:01:26] Deliverance come on somebody it's a
[1:01:29] message of Deliverance our young people
[1:01:31] would have no hope without a message of
[1:01:35] Deliverance I would have no hope without
[1:01:37] a message of Deliverance you would be
[1:01:40] hopeless but the message has come to
[1:01:43] deliver you from the way you were to the
[1:01:45] way you are now well I'm just going to
[1:01:47] preach to you for a minute it looked
[1:01:49] like it was hopeless for the three he
[1:01:50] Hebrew children but it wasn't hopeless
[1:01:53] because Jesus came along you know when
[1:01:56] Jesus comes Everything Changes you know
[1:01:59] when the disciples got in the boat and
[1:02:00] they went to the other side they got out
[1:02:02] there and the storms got bad and the
[1:02:04] waves got high but can I tell you
[1:02:06] something somebody was in the boat with
[1:02:08] them when the storms of life look like
[1:02:10] you can't take no more I said Jesus is
[1:02:12] with you yes sir well ought to make a
[1:02:15] Baptist or Presbyterian shout did you
[1:02:17] know if Jesus is with you then you know
[1:02:19] all hell can come against you but it has
[1:02:21] no power over you that's right Satan has
[1:02:27] nothing over you Satan has no hold on
[1:02:30] you Satan can't do anything to harm
[1:02:33] God's children more than God would allow
[1:02:35] him to do when job was sitting there on
[1:02:38] the ash Heap no doubt he had lost
[1:02:39] everything he had got into a position
[1:02:41] where he's like you know I don't think I
[1:02:43] could lose no more but he never lost his
[1:02:46] faith in God I said I'm never going to
[1:02:48] lose my faith I don't care if God would
[1:02:50] you know what God may allow things to
[1:02:52] come against me but I'm going to tell
[1:02:53] you tonight I'm standing on a promise
[1:02:56] that he will restore everything back to
[1:02:57] me I'm here to tell you we are Abraham's
[1:03:00] children we are children of the promise
[1:03:02] tonight and God has promised to not
[1:03:04] leave you so why would you ever feel
[1:03:09] alone I think it's time that we realize
[1:03:12] he's still
[1:03:13] God and he changes not I could fail you
[1:03:18] man will fail you women can fail you
[1:03:20] people can fail you life may try to fail
[1:03:23] you but Jesus will never fail you why
[1:03:25] because he's not just a friend but he's
[1:03:28] your friend and your brother and he's
[1:03:29] taken you under his wings and he's got
[1:03:31] himself into your heart he's got his
[1:03:33] spirit in there and he can never leave
[1:03:35] you nor forsake you I think if we would
[1:03:37] just recognize that tonight I know
[1:03:39] you're tired I can tell by looking at
[1:03:40] you but let me just tell you this I wish
[1:03:42] you would just give Jesus a few more
[1:03:44] minutes to say you know what I may be
[1:03:46] tired in my body but the reason I can be
[1:03:48] in church tonight is because somebody
[1:03:50] gave me a desire and it wasn't the devil
[1:03:52] that made you sit here
[1:03:54] I've told you before the devil ain't
[1:03:56] going to make you go to church at 3:00
[1:03:57] in the afternoon after you just got your
[1:03:59] belly full on food that's right the
[1:04:02] devil is not going to let you he's not
[1:04:03] going to make you go to the house of God
[1:04:05] he's going to try to get you to run as
[1:04:07] far as you can from it you're not going
[1:04:09] to drive an hour or two hours to go to
[1:04:12] church if it's the devil motivating you
[1:04:15] come on but it's Jesus on the inside and
[1:04:18] it's showing up in your life because
[1:04:20] you're listening to the word of God that
[1:04:22] said I would never he he said he said
[1:04:24] don't stay home if God is in your heart
[1:04:26] you can't wait for them Church doors to
[1:04:28] open so I say tonight if we can just get
[1:04:30] God in our hearts then it'll solve a
[1:04:32] whole lot of problems we got going on I
[1:04:34] tell you what it'll take care of church
[1:04:35] problems Church complexes people
[1:04:38] complexes preacher complexes it'll take
[1:04:40] care of a whole lot of problems if God
[1:04:42] would get on the inside of the people
[1:04:44] well brother Joel I've got the Holy
[1:04:46] Ghost let me just go aad and tell you
[1:04:47] something some of you Old-Timers need
[1:04:49] the refilling just like the young people
[1:04:50] do I don't doubt many of you got the
[1:04:52] Holy Ghost but a refill filling is a
[1:04:55] necessary thing to keep you in the hour
[1:04:57] that we're living
[1:04:59] in I don't need the Holy Ghost yes you
[1:05:01] do and refilling and refilling after
[1:05:05] refilling because the world is going to
[1:05:07] try to make you cold and Satan's going
[1:05:09] to try to make you he's going to try to
[1:05:11] take you out this hour do you realize
[1:05:13] it's his job to come and try to kill you
[1:05:15] and destroy you it was his job to make
[1:05:18] the wav so high that the disciples even
[1:05:20] that had seen Miracle after Miracle
[1:05:23] would get afraid of a storm on the sea
[1:05:25] and Jesus was right in the boat with
[1:05:26] them and you know what they did they
[1:05:28] went and called Jesus on the scene and
[1:05:30] you know what he did he took care of it
[1:05:32] he said fear not peace be still and did
[1:05:35] you know you have the same Authority
[1:05:37] come on somebody you have the same
[1:05:39] Authority that the disciples had to call
[1:05:41] Jesus on the scene in this hour and he's
[1:05:43] so close to you that when you say Lord I
[1:05:46] can't take the storm any longer I can't
[1:05:48] take the fear any longer I can't take
[1:05:50] this I can't take this complex any
[1:05:52] longer did you know he's still in the
[1:05:54] the boat all you got to do is go say
[1:05:56] Jesus I need you in this hour I Need You
[1:05:59] In This Storm I can't handle it on my
[1:06:01] own and he's right there waiting
[1:06:03] patiently to be called on the scene he's
[1:06:07] never left you you've never been in this
[1:06:09] alone and you never will be if you've
[1:06:11] taken on Jesus Christ in your
[1:06:14] heart Thank You Lord we get into a
[1:06:17] position to where we think we think
[1:06:20] we're not worthy to have Jesus with
[1:06:23] us just repent and give it to
[1:06:27] Jesus there was a disciple on that boat
[1:06:29] that probably didn't deserve to be there
[1:06:32] maybe several of them were sitting there
[1:06:34] and they were
[1:06:35] illiterate think about it these weren't
[1:06:38] the these weren't the ones that the
[1:06:39] priest and the scribes would have called
[1:06:41] to be preachers these were not the men
[1:06:43] that would have been next in line to
[1:06:45] take the biggest
[1:06:47] church these were men that Jesus went to
[1:06:51] personally on and these men here had
[1:06:55] something more than what the scribes and
[1:06:57] the Pharisees had they had a personal
[1:07:00] relationship with Jesus and when they
[1:07:03] got in trouble come on somebody when
[1:07:05] they got in trouble they had somebody
[1:07:07] they could talk to when you get in
[1:07:09] trouble you've got somebody you can talk
[1:07:12] to when you feel like you're alone
[1:07:14] you're not in this
[1:07:16] alone when you feel like you can't go
[1:07:19] any farther he's as close as your right
[1:07:22] arm oh yeah amen let me deal with this
[1:07:25] for just a moment I've only got about
[1:07:26] five minutes left according to my timer
[1:07:28] what keeps you from calling Jesus on the
[1:07:30] scene and realizing you're not in this
[1:07:32] alone is
[1:07:35] fear right but he said fear not he told
[1:07:39] the disciples fear
[1:07:41] not Jesus is with you I am in the boat
[1:07:46] I'm still in the middle when when you
[1:07:48] were at the lowest point of your life
[1:07:51] and many of you are thinking
[1:07:52] back h l you were he was there all the
[1:07:56] time all he was waiting on was hey call
[1:07:59] Call My Name call me up I'm ready to
[1:08:01] give you whatever you have need of I'm
[1:08:04] ready to fill you with the Holy Ghost
[1:08:06] young people did you know that once
[1:08:07] you're baptized all you got to do is
[1:08:09] believe it I told you that last week
[1:08:11] don't be doubting about receiving the
[1:08:13] Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is right there
[1:08:15] waiting for you to receive it did you
[1:08:17] know there's many adults that are
[1:08:18] sitting there that have been baptized
[1:08:20] and they went to Youth Camp and they're
[1:08:21] sitting there today and they think well
[1:08:22] I just never got the whole ho ghost I'm
[1:08:24] a Christian because you know what I gave
[1:08:25] my heart to the Lord I've been baptized
[1:08:27] but I'm just waiting on the Holy Ghost
[1:08:29] did you know he's there he's just
[1:08:30] waiting on you to say I've got it I
[1:08:32] accept it I believe it it's mine did you
[1:08:35] know it's yours tonight it's always been
[1:08:37] there ready for you but you've got to
[1:08:39] ask Jesus Come into my
[1:08:42] heart come in and take control fill
[1:08:44] every fiber of my being come in and take
[1:08:47] over the things that I'm trying to do on
[1:08:49] my own I'm trying to live a life on my
[1:08:51] own I'm trying to go to church and raise
[1:08:53] children on my my own but if you try to
[1:08:54] do it on your own you're going to fail
[1:08:56] miserably but if you got Jesus in the
[1:08:58] home if you got Jesus in your corner
[1:09:01] then all hell can come against you but
[1:09:03] Jesus will take over when you can't go
[1:09:06] any
[1:09:07] farther thank you Lord you're not in it
[1:09:10] alone I'd like to say this you're not a
[1:09:13] hopeless
[1:09:14] case you've not went too
[1:09:16] far fear is a liar can you say Amen to
[1:09:20] that anxiety will try to come upon you
[1:09:23] and say well I just can't do this I
[1:09:25] can't go to church and I I I just can't
[1:09:27] go around these people cuz they make me
[1:09:28] scared well I say cast that demon of
[1:09:31] anxiety
[1:09:32] out come on somebody don't feed that
[1:09:35] Devil by saying you know what I'm going
[1:09:37] to go on Facebook and make me a post and
[1:09:38] say well I'm so anxious I can't talk to
[1:09:41] you I can't even be around you why don't
[1:09:42] you start confessing positive things why
[1:09:45] don't you start saying you know what
[1:09:46] Spirit of anxiety you're defeated why
[1:09:49] don't you start saying spirit of fear
[1:09:51] you're defeated Spirit of I tell you
[1:09:54] what whatever Spirit you've been dealing
[1:09:55] with say that spirit's name and say
[1:09:57] you're
[1:09:58] defeated Spirit of cancer Spirit of
[1:10:01] sickness whatever it is you're defeated
[1:10:04] today you don't have to accept that box
[1:10:06] of rattlesnakes in your life can you say
[1:10:09] amen I said you don't have to accept
[1:10:11] what the devil's got for you why is it
[1:10:13] so hard for people to live a Christian
[1:10:15] Life and and why are people so tossed
[1:10:17] about I'll tell you what it is fear has
[1:10:19] kept them from an overcoming life fear
[1:10:22] has kept them from their victory the 10
[1:10:24] that we're standing back here saying we
[1:10:26] can't go over let me just tell you this
[1:10:29] if that's the idea that you've got we
[1:10:30] can't take the land you'll never take
[1:10:32] the land but if you can be like Joshua
[1:10:34] and Caleb and say you know what we're
[1:10:36] more than able I've got a spirit I've
[1:10:38] got a complex and I just can't overcome
[1:10:40] but we're more than able because greater
[1:10:43] is he that is within you and he's with
[1:10:45] you all the days of your life greater is
[1:10:48] that person than any devil that tries to
[1:10:50] come against
[1:10:52] you thank you well God is still in
[1:10:54] control can you say amen God has still
[1:10:56] got it all in his hands God knows
[1:10:59] exactly what you need and he would never
[1:11:01] put more on you than you can
[1:11:04] handle you believe that
[1:11:07] tonight I was looking at David and
[1:11:10] Goliath I talked about this maybe last
[1:11:12] week or a couple months ago
[1:11:14] and you know the strength of Goliath
[1:11:17] would have never defeat or excuse me the
[1:11:19] strength of David would have never
[1:11:20] defeated Goliath right that's right if
[1:11:23] you looked at himself he was never going
[1:11:24] to overcome on his own if he would have
[1:11:26] looked in the mirror one time he might
[1:11:27] have got scared to death but did you
[1:11:29] know who was standing behind him you
[1:11:31] know who was living in him did you know
[1:11:34] the the faith he had was in an unseen
[1:11:36] God oh I wish you could brother
[1:11:39] mentioned at the tent meeting looking at
[1:11:41] the Unseen if you could just look at the
[1:11:43] Unseen tonight and realize the angels
[1:11:45] that are lying in the walls you say well
[1:11:47] that was just brother brandham saying
[1:11:48] that for the tabern no that's with every
[1:11:50] believer because the Angels encamp
[1:11:52] around those that believe I believe
[1:11:53] believe there's Angels lining every Pew
[1:11:55] here tonight I believe there's Angels
[1:11:56] sitting right next to you you know you
[1:11:58] see a bunch of empty chairs I see a
[1:11:59] bunch of angels sitting there ready to
[1:12:01] go to battle for you come on somebody
[1:12:03] they're ready on Monday morning to get
[1:12:05] up with you and do what you want but you
[1:12:06] got to call Jesus on the
[1:12:10] scene don't try to go about it
[1:12:13] yourself don't try to live an overcoming
[1:12:17] life without the Holy Ghost right say
[1:12:21] well I I I want to live like a Christian
[1:12:22] I want to dress like like a Christian I
[1:12:24] want to be a Christian but I don't
[1:12:26] really want the Holy Ghost cuz it might
[1:12:27] make me act
[1:12:29] funny you know the Holy Ghost may very
[1:12:31] well make you act funny may very well it
[1:12:34] make you act
[1:12:35] crazy I liked what a brother said the
[1:12:37] other night whose fool are
[1:12:39] you I'm a fool for Jesus it may not look
[1:12:42] like much I may not be able to do much
[1:12:44] of my own but I like to say this I'm on
[1:12:47] the Lord's Side and whoever's on the
[1:12:49] Lord's Side let him come right on over
[1:12:50] here I say whoever's on the Lord's Side
[1:12:52] let him pick pick up his sword and go to
[1:12:55] fighting every devil that's trying to
[1:12:56] come against
[1:12:58] you that's what we we're in a battle
[1:13:01] this is not a picnic brother brandom
[1:13:02] said he said I'm I don't have I've got
[1:13:04] the quote but I can't get to it he said
[1:13:05] he said I'm afraid too many ministers
[1:13:07] have made it a flowery bed of ease to
[1:13:09] come to the Lord he said no he said it's
[1:13:11] a fight and you'll fight for every inch
[1:13:13] and every piece of ground you take but
[1:13:15] did you know that you've already been
[1:13:17] promised to be an overcomer did you know
[1:13:19] if those 10 could have looked over there
[1:13:21] and seen the results they wouldn't have
[1:13:23] they would never had any fear if they
[1:13:25] could have just looked at the results of
[1:13:26] the victory they would have never had
[1:13:28] the fear but he already went and saw the
[1:13:31] future and saw you Victorious I said
[1:13:34] you're an overcoming people all you got
[1:13:37] to do is say you know what I don't know
[1:13:39] about tomorrow but I Know Who Holds my
[1:13:41] future I don't know what's going to
[1:13:43] happen to me I don't know what's going
[1:13:44] to happen to my job I don't know what's
[1:13:46] going to happen to my children but I
[1:13:47] know who holds the future and I know
[1:13:50] he's got everything in his hands oh I
[1:13:52] hope somebody's hearing me tonight you
[1:13:53] may feel like it's out of control you
[1:13:56] may feel like the world is just going in
[1:13:57] a direction and you know what you look
[1:13:59] at the news and it'll make you feel like
[1:14:01] you're nothing and you're not going to
[1:14:02] make it well what's going to happen to
[1:14:04] my children and my grandchildren and our
[1:14:06] inheritances and all this stuff I tell
[1:14:08] you what just give it to Jesus just let
[1:14:10] let him know you know what Lord this is
[1:14:12] giving me anxiety this is giving me all
[1:14:14] kinds of problems this is giving me
[1:14:16] depression but if you'll just listen to
[1:14:18] the word of God and let him soothe you
[1:14:20] with the Holy Spirit and let the
[1:14:21] comforter come in and take you control
[1:14:23] of you young people then it won't matter
[1:14:25] when the devil tries to come against you
[1:14:27] because greater is he that is on the
[1:14:29] inside of you than he that's in the
[1:14:31] world trying to overtake you can you say
[1:14:33] amen I said greater is he that is in you
[1:14:36] you may be small and stature but you're
[1:14:39] great in the power of God I said That's
[1:14:41] goes for every one of us we may not be
[1:14:42] the smartest people in the world we may
[1:14:44] not be the best speakers in the message
[1:14:46] or in the world or in any other
[1:14:48] organization but I'll tell you this if
[1:14:49] God is in you you are the greatest force
[1:14:52] that Satan is has ever met in this
[1:14:54] world you are such a mighty force that
[1:14:58] you know Satan trembles when you get out
[1:14:59] of bed in the morning Satan's scared to
[1:15:02] death of you why are we so scared of
[1:15:05] him and I'd like to say it this way just
[1:15:08] before we close I paused my timer that
[1:15:10] wasn't
[1:15:12] good just before we Clos did you know if
[1:15:15] Goliath would have known the outcome he'
[1:15:18] to run
[1:15:20] too I say tell that devil what his
[1:15:22] outcome
[1:15:24] is I said tell that devil who he is
[1:15:27] where he come from and where he's going
[1:15:30] he may not know it but he's up against
[1:15:32] the greatest army in the world we're the
[1:15:35] greatest military force in the world oh
[1:15:37] come on somebody I said we're greater
[1:15:39] than the be I don't care how many how
[1:15:41] many rockets and how many you know all
[1:15:43] these machine guns and tanks and I don't
[1:15:45] care what they've got but you're a
[1:15:46] greater force I said it's going to take
[1:15:48] a stronger win than the devil to keep us
[1:15:51] from winning this Army if we could stand
[1:15:54] together musicians
[1:15:56] come I'm out of time but I want to say
[1:15:59] this you don't have to be fearful
[1:16:02] today because God that's right has not
[1:16:05] given you the spirit of
[1:16:07] fear but he's given you the spirit of
[1:16:11] Love Can you say amen he wants you to
[1:16:14] have a sound mind he doesn't want you to
[1:16:16] have complexes and depression right come
[1:16:21] on somebody I know Satan's going to
[1:16:23] fight your mind that's where the
[1:16:24] greatest battlefields
[1:16:25] at but I believe there's an army rising
[1:16:28] up in this day can you say
[1:16:30] Amen right I look across the land you
[1:16:32] can see pestilences and you can see all
[1:16:34] kinds of things taking place but there's
[1:16:36] a bride rising up there's somebody
[1:16:39] rising up to meet the challenge of the
[1:16:40] hour there's somebody going to take
[1:16:43] control of that devil in your home and
[1:16:45] say you know what Satan you're under my
[1:16:47] feet Satan you can't stay any longer
[1:16:50] because by God's word I cast you down
[1:16:52] and I'll say it again the word of God
[1:16:54] will defeat Satan on any grounds under
[1:16:57] any condition if you take your sword of
[1:16:59] faith and you just believe the word then
[1:17:01] don't you wait for something great to
[1:17:03] happen at a great meeting or something
[1:17:05] right here on this Sunday afternoon
[1:17:06] right here on this Sunday afternoon and
[1:17:08] on Monday morning when you take the
[1:17:10] sword and you go to Jesus say you know
[1:17:12] what Lord I'm not going to be cast down
[1:17:14] I'm not going to be defeated by the
[1:17:16] devil but you have raised me up for a
[1:17:18] purpose you have called me for a Time
[1:17:20] such as this and I'm not alone but I
[1:17:23] have a force with me that's so much
[1:17:25] greater than any Force Satan's God I
[1:17:28] wonder if you can say that tonight as a
[1:17:29] confession of your faith say greater is
[1:17:31] he greater is he I'm a bride I'm raising
[1:17:34] up in this age I'm going to overcome in
[1:17:37] this day I'm not on my own powers not on
[1:17:39] my own marriage but by grace in Jesus
[1:17:42] Christ and faith in his word I'm going
[1:17:44] to overcome it all in this day can you
[1:17:47] say praise the Lord I know this was I
[1:17:49] know this was simple but sometimes I was
[1:17:51] thinking about encouragement this week
[1:17:53] and I thought you know what we need to
[1:17:54] encourage ourselves in the Lord we need
[1:17:56] to encourage one another in the Lord I
[1:17:58] say take the word of God and it will
[1:18:01] defeat the Devil all you have to do is

[1:22:23] message this afternoon thank brother
[1:22:25] Joel for doing that I I know it's his
[1:22:27] anniversary today but thankful for
[1:22:30] brother Joel and his stand for the word
[1:22:31] I pick on him a lot but that's just part
[1:22:34] of how you grow up I learned that from
[1:22:36] Brother Monroe how to pick on people
[1:22:39] so had to get brother Monro while he's
[1:22:41] here but but you know that's uh that's
[1:22:44] just part of it I first time brother
[1:22:46] Joel ever preached I announced I said if
[1:22:48] the Lord could speak through a donkey he
[1:22:50] could speak through brother Joel and and
[1:22:52] um boy the Lord has really worked in
[1:22:54] brother Joel's Ministry and we're so
[1:22:56] thankful for that and his faithfulness
[1:22:58] especially to the house of God and to
[1:23:00] the church just doing what needs to be
[1:23:02] done and I don't have to ask him to do
[1:23:04] that he just does that and I appreciate
[1:23:05] that appreciate all of you who are
[1:23:07] faithful to the house of God means so
[1:23:09] much to us and I'm I'm going to be uh
[1:23:12] preaching again on Friday night at
[1:23:14] brother Bose meetings it's a little
[1:23:15] bitty Church in Dyersburg Tennessee and
[1:23:18] I'm trying to just be encouraging to him
[1:23:20] he kept asking me if I could come and
[1:23:22] and brother Joel goes over there and
[1:23:24] preaches and they just love brother Joel
[1:23:25] but I'm going to go and try to put my
[1:23:27] shoulder to the wheel and that's on
[1:23:29] Friday night I'm not staying I'll be
[1:23:30] back here on Sunday but if anybody would
[1:23:32] like to go we'd sure be glad to have you
[1:23:34] because it is a very small Church it'd
[1:23:36] be encouraging to them if anybody wants
[1:23:38] to go it's about three hours from here
[1:23:41] we're going to have um several baptisms
[1:23:43] over the next two
[1:23:46] weeks um a couple of weeks and I don't
[1:23:49] know at least two and I think there's
[1:23:51] some others that that uh that got on
[1:23:53] their heart from that service last
[1:23:54] Sunday night sometimes sometimes you
[1:23:56] just have to preach the word say this is
[1:23:59] what repent and be baptized and the
[1:24:02] young people respond to that you do that
[1:24:04] in the right atmosphere things will
[1:24:05] happen I believe God always honors his
[1:24:08] word so we're thankful for that and
[1:24:10] we're just looking forward to each one
[1:24:12] of these kids now we're going to do that
[1:24:13] today but Allan's going to sing what we
[1:24:15] do is we just continue the service in
[1:24:17] the fellowship hall for just a few
[1:24:19] minutes and uh and our our sister Ella
[1:24:21] is going to be baptized now she's asked
[1:24:23] brother Joel to baptize her and I'm
[1:24:26] thankful for that I number one that gets
[1:24:28] me out of it so but uh but no I really
[1:24:31] it's always a privilege to baptize these
[1:24:33] kids but I think that's special brother
[1:24:35] Joel she she wrote a letter and said how
[1:24:38] she'd repented God uh repented of her
[1:24:39] sins and things like that isn't that
[1:24:41] precious and and uh that's wonderful
[1:24:44] isn't
[1:24:47] it and sister ell you just serve the
[1:24:49] Lord all the days of your life and
[1:24:51] remember your not in this alone you'll
[1:24:53] you'll be okay but so what we're going
[1:24:55] to do is brother Alan's going to sing a
[1:24:56] song and then we'll just go straight to
[1:24:58] the fellowship hall and we have a
[1:25:00] baptistry set up there and uh we'll go
[1:25:02] straight there and and brother Joel will
[1:25:04] read the scripture and conduct the
[1:25:06] baptism and so we're looking forward to
[1:25:08] that amen you love the Lord let's just
[1:25:10] bow our heads for just a moment Heavenly
[1:25:12] Father Lord I I pray especially for
[1:25:14] sister Ella today Lord that you'd bless
[1:25:17] her in her life oh God we're so so
[1:25:20] thankful for your for your continuing
[1:25:23] presence in our lives Lord and maybe
[1:25:27] she'd get older and she'd look back and
[1:25:28] say well I made some mistakes and did
[1:25:30] some things that not proud of but you
[1:25:32] were always there with me Lord and I
[1:25:34] know you will be pray you'd help her to
[1:25:37] believe that fill her with the Holy
[1:25:38] Spirit Lord and just walk with her Lord
[1:25:40] and be with her Lord maybe we look at
[1:25:44] these young people want to be baptized
[1:25:46] maybe it's getting close to the end
[1:25:48] maybe maybe the reason is because they
[1:25:50] feel that tug Lord if it is oh God lord
[1:25:55] I pray it would be so take us home oh
[1:25:58] god oh we we feel a drawing a pulling to

[1:26:13] Lord Lord I I don't want one to miss it
[1:26:16] I want every one of us to be able to
[1:26:18] make it Lord I pray that that would be
[1:26:20] the case today oh God Lord if there's a
[1:26:23] if there's an unbeliever or makeb
