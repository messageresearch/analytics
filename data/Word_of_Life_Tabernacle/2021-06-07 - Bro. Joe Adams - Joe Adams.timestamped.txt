[37:03] spoke this morning we spoke on god does
[37:05] impossible math this evening we're going
[37:07] to do part
[37:08] two but i want this to subtitle to be
[37:10] nothing
[37:11] impossible with you i think a lot of
[37:14] times we find that there's nothing
[37:16] impossible with god
[37:17] as we spoke about this morning but we
[37:19] find we have difficulties placing
[37:21] ourselves
[37:22] in the promise we find difficulties
[37:24] placing ourselves
[37:25] there and say you know what nothing's
[37:26] impossible with me if i can believe so
[37:29] we look here in luke 1 verse 26 and in
[37:32] the sixth month
[37:35] in the sixth month the angel gabriel was
[37:37] sent from god
[37:38] unto the city of galilee named nazareth
[37:41] to a virgin espoused to a man whose name
[37:43] was joseph
[37:44] and of the house of david and the
[37:46] virgin's name was mary
[37:49] and the angel came in unto her and said
[37:51] hell
[37:52] thou highly favored the lord is with
[37:54] thee blessed art thou among women
[37:57] and when she saw him she was troubled at
[37:59] the saying
[38:02] and cast in her mind what manner of
[38:04] salutation this should be and the angel
[38:05] said unto her
[38:06] fear not mary for thou has found favor
[38:09] with god
[38:12] and behold thou shalt conceive in thy
[38:13] womb and bring forth a son
[38:15] and thou shall call his name jesus and
[38:18] he shall be great and he shall be called
[38:20] the son of the highest
[38:21] and the lord shall give unto him the
[38:24] throne of his father david
[38:25] and he shall reign over the house of
[38:27] jacob forever and of his kingdom there
[38:29] shall be no end
[38:30] then said mary unto the angel how shall
[38:33] this be
[38:34] seeing i know not a man and the angel
[38:36] answered and said unto her
[38:38] the holy ghost shall come upon thee and
[38:40] the power
[38:41] of the highest shall overshadow thee
[38:43] therefore also the holy thing
[38:45] we shall be born of thee shall be called
[38:46] the son of god
[38:48] and behold thy cousin elizabeth she has
[38:51] also conceived a son in her old age
[38:53] and this is a six month with her who
[38:55] shall be called barren
[38:57] for with god nothing shall be impossible
[38:59] and mary
[39:00] said behold the handmaid of the lord be
[39:02] it unto me according to thy word
[39:05] and the angel departed from her you can
[39:07] have your seats this evening
[39:13] as we look at this and we we draw our
[39:16] context
[39:16] and nothing is impossible with you i
[39:19] come here from the
[39:20] we're going to come out of the the
[39:21] message mary's belief and brother
[39:23] branham will begin to tell the story and
[39:25] paint the picture
[39:26] you know as only a profit candy said the
[39:28] spring sun was rising
[39:30] high in the judean skies and she started
[39:32] up the little street that morning
[39:34] with the water pot under her arm and her
[39:36] little youthful mom was thinking of the
[39:38] day before you know this was maybe a
[39:40] sunday
[39:41] she's reflecting back or a monday and
[39:43] she's reflecting back on the previous
[39:45] day of the service
[39:46] and brother brown would say her youthful
[39:48] mind was thinking of the day before how
[39:50] that
[39:50] at the synagogue where she and her
[39:52] espoused husband had
[39:54] sit and listen to the sermon from the
[39:55] rabbi and
[39:57] he would begin to talk and explain how
[39:59] the people while they were settled in
[40:01] the land and how he gave him a promise
[40:02] and
[40:03] god would be their father or the god
[40:05] with he was the father of abraham and
[40:07] he told them a hundred years before how
[40:09] they would inherit a land and
[40:10] how when god made the promise that he
[40:12] couldn't go back on that promise
[40:14] you know i want you to know tonight
[40:15] church he's still the same god
[40:17] when god gives the promise god doesn't
[40:19] go back on the promise
[40:21] just because it hasn't transpired
[40:22] immediately doesn't mean that god has
[40:24] given up on the promise
[40:26] god has given the promise he told
[40:28] abraham your
[40:29] your children is going to sojourn in a
[40:30] strange land for many many many years
[40:32] and it was 420 440 years
[40:35] but god remembered his promise and he's
[40:37] as much god for you tonight as he was
[40:39] for abraham
[40:40] as he was for isaac is he was for jacob
[40:43] is he was for brother branham he's as
[40:44] much god tonight
[40:46] as he was with mary said you're going to
[40:48] have a child behold
[40:49] and let me tell you he's the same god
[40:51] tonight as he was
[40:52] then and she began to contemplate and
[40:56] talk about this and wonder
[40:58] you know this rabbi was talking about
[41:00] all the great promises of god and
[41:02] how god made the promise how god didn't
[41:04] back up off the promise
[41:06] how they came through the red sea on dry
[41:08] ground and how before that god had
[41:09] promised he was going to deal with their
[41:11] enemy and the problem of god said god
[41:13] loves to deal with your enemy i say
[41:16] blessed be the name of the lord
[41:18] here's my enemy deal with my enemy
[41:20] tonight it's too much for me god
[41:22] but i'm asking tonight that you deal
[41:24] with my enemy
[41:25] he said how god loves to deal with the
[41:28] children of
[41:29] of of god's enemy right there and the
[41:31] rabbi no doubt may have taught about how
[41:33] god shut the mouths of the lions when
[41:36] daniel went to the den
[41:38] maybe he talked about the hebrew
[41:39] children how when they throw him in
[41:41] there was a fourth man there that met
[41:43] them in the fiery furnace
[41:45] maybe he began to talk about shamgar he
[41:47] was held
[41:48] year after year after year lived
[41:50] defeated he'd be overcome by the
[41:52] philistines and overcome by the
[41:54] blessings
[41:54] but one day he recognized that the god
[41:57] of abraham
[41:58] the god of jacob and the god of isaac
[42:00] was his god
[42:01] and he rose up in faith and he took
[42:02] everything that he had a knox gold in
[42:04] his hand
[42:05] and he slew 600 philistines oh he was
[42:08] telling her
[42:09] about the supernatural about how god is
[42:12] how david
[42:13] or yeah david took uh not david share
[42:15] now let me just find who i'm talking
[42:17] about now samson
[42:18] took a jawbone of an ass and beat down
[42:21] one thousand philistines
[42:26] and when he got done he was thirsty and
[42:28] took a drink out of that same jawbone
[42:33] began to tell about how there was a
[42:35] valley and had a bunch of dry bones and
[42:37] as we spoke about this morning
[42:39] and those dry bones began to come to
[42:40] life
[42:43] you know and how the enemy just god
[42:46] dealt with the enemy the whole time
[42:48] but brother branham would talk and he
[42:49] would just begin to tell he says but at
[42:51] the end of his message
[42:53] he ruined what he had been talking about
[42:56] when he said that those great days of
[42:58] jehovah dealing with the people like
[43:00] that
[43:01] it wasn't necessary no more
[43:04] oh my we don't have that same spirit
[43:06] here today
[43:08] oh the days of miracles is past god
[43:11] doesn't do those things anymore
[43:13] it was only for the prophet
[43:19] he says but you know she began to say he
[43:22] ruined his message because
[43:24] he said that god doesn't deal with with
[43:26] with people like that anymore
[43:28] it wasn't necessary no more they they
[43:30] become settled down in their homeland
[43:32] they didn't exactly need miracles no
[43:34] more they had good doctors for their
[43:36] sickness
[43:38] they were better off they had their
[43:39] homes they just didn't need a god of
[43:41] miracles anymore
[43:42] but somehow that didn't satisfy the
[43:45] thirst and hunger in joseph and mary
[43:47] and i pray tonight that it doesn't
[43:49] satisfy that hunger
[43:50] and that thirst inside your believing
[43:52] heart tonight oh let them say the days
[43:54] of miracles has passed that's fine for
[43:56] them but that's too late i've seen the
[43:58] god of miracles
[43:59] i've witnessed a god of miracles and
[44:01] he's as much god tonight as he will be
[44:03] tomorrow for your situation
[44:05] for your need he's very much the god of
[44:08] miracles
[44:10] but we find the same spirit today the
[44:12] same thing people say that
[44:13] the days of the supernatural are over
[44:17] they don't want prayer lines anymore
[44:19] they don't want altar calls anymore they
[44:21] don't want people coming to the lord
[44:23] anymore
[44:23] all they want is a dry-eyed confession
[44:26] all that they want is a letter
[44:29] an intellectual understanding of the
[44:32] message
[44:33] otherwise they camp down on formalism
[44:36] and they put the movement of the spirit
[44:38] out of the church
[44:39] because they don't want those whooping
[44:41] screaming acts 238 youngins
[44:47] but the prophet god said that's the only
[44:50] kind the word produces
[44:52] so if you ain't jumping you ain't
[44:54] shouting you ain't screaming
[44:55] it makes me wonder are you worried or
[44:57] not are you born of that same seed or
[45:00] not
[45:01] because that's the only kind that the
[45:03] word can't produce
[45:04] and i'm gonna tell you how bored of that
[45:06] same seed
[45:07] i got shouting inside my bones i got
[45:10] life inside my body
[45:11] i got something to shout about i know
[45:13] where i was headed and i'm here to tell
[45:15] you that voice came down
[45:17] and said turn your car around i ain't
[45:19] never been the same church
[45:25] and if god has done something for you i
[45:27] heard a brother the other day
[45:28] gave a testimony he said when he found
[45:31] out and realized
[45:32] that he was a son of god he said i could
[45:35] swing from the rafters
[45:38] and he looked out he says i don't
[45:39] understand how some of y'all ain't
[45:40] swinging from the rafters
[45:43] oh to realize you're sons and daughters
[45:45] of god
[45:47] got to know your place see they want to
[45:50] say that the supernatural
[45:53] was only for brother branham we
[45:54] shouldn't expect to see the same signs
[45:56] and wonders
[46:00] bingo so i ask you like what good is a
[46:03] god of yesterday
[46:05] if he's not god tonight
[46:08] what good is a god that can turn around
[46:10] and discern things
[46:11] with his back turn if he's not the very
[46:14] same god tonight
[46:15] now i'm not saying that we got to have
[46:17] that happen but i'm saying the god of
[46:19] miracles is still the same
[46:21] the prophet of god may be off the scene
[46:23] but god has never left the scene
[46:25] god has never left his people god is
[46:27] still here god is still in power
[46:30] god still has the authority and if you
[46:32] can believe that god tonight then
[46:33] there's nothing impossible with you
[46:36] he's the same god he's the same healer
[46:38] he's the same deliverer that he always
[46:40] has been
[46:44] so mary said you know talking to joseph
[46:47] since i heard the rabbi
[46:49] this great god that brought us here and
[46:51] made us what we are
[46:53] he doesn't have to do these things
[46:54] anymore like he did then she goes i've
[46:57] been thinking for a long time
[46:59] if this god was so great in the days of
[47:01] our fathers
[47:03] and in the days of our grandfathers then
[47:05] why isn't he just the same
[47:07] great god today and i asked you as
[47:10] believers
[47:12] you claim to believe god sent a prophet
[47:13] but more importantly you claim to
[47:14] believe that you're a son and daughter
[47:16] of god
[47:17] and if god was so great in the days of
[47:19] azusa
[47:21] if he was let's go even go further back
[47:22] to that if he was so great in the upper
[47:24] room
[47:25] and they staggered out like drunk men
[47:28] and three thousand gave their heart to
[47:29] the lord
[47:30] and we come down to our day in the
[47:31] restoration of the gifts and we sing
[47:33] souls after souls after souls
[47:35] receive the baptism our holy ghost if
[47:37] he's so great then why isn't he great
[47:39] today
[47:40] if he was so great in the 40s in the 50s
[47:42] in the 60s and blind eyes were open
[47:45] and the dead would raise and the sick
[47:47] were healed and situations were dealt
[47:49] with
[47:49] why isn't he the same god tonight it's
[47:52] because of the people's unbelief but i'm
[47:54] here to testify to you
[47:55] he's the same god and if you can believe
[47:58] tonight he'll bring forth your healing
[48:00] he'll bring forth your deliverance he'll
[48:02] come on the scene for your need
[48:05] he's still god he's still supernatural
[48:08] he still possesses authority and power
[48:10] over every demonic spirit
[48:16] oh hallelujah you know doubt she's
[48:19] pondering this my wife isn't god great
[48:22] why is it that we don't need him anymore
[48:25] why is it that we all have to just push
[48:26] play
[48:28] why is it we all got to get on the same
[48:30] scripture same verse same sermon
[48:32] and let's just do it at the same time
[48:37] i thought he was so good i thought every
[48:39] church was sovereign i thought this
[48:41] i thought that oh my
[48:45] oh brother joe you you you you're
[48:47] stepping out of your boundaries
[48:49] no sir i've been anointed i've been in
[48:52] order to preach the gospel the good news
[48:54] i'm going to tell you there's a good
[48:55] news tonight there ain't no headship
[48:57] over this bride
[48:58] the headship is jesus christ we're not
[49:00] looking at jeffersonville
[49:02] we're looking at the eternity we're
[49:03] looking to an eternal god
[49:05] and he's declared in his word i'm the
[49:07] same god i change
[49:08] not i'm the same yesterday today and
[49:11] forever if i ever heal once
[49:12] i'm gonna heal tonight if i ever
[49:14] delivered once i'll deliver you tonight
[49:17] and if the people can't believe nothing
[49:19] will stand before their prayer
[49:22] i said nothing will stand before your
[49:23] prayer if you can believe tonight
[49:25] if you can trust god tonight
[49:30] so she's walking going to the well to
[49:34] get some water
[49:35] pondering about the surface from the day
[49:38] before
[49:40] thinking about isaiah 9 for unto us a
[49:43] child is born
[49:44] a son is given the government shall be
[49:46] upon his shoulder
[49:48] his name shall be called wonderful
[49:49] counselor the mighty god the everlasting
[49:51] father
[49:52] the prince of peace imagine this the
[49:55] days of miracles are passed right
[49:57] so how is god going to do this
[50:01] how is god going to bring this promised
[50:02] son what is god going to do we've been
[50:05] looking for it
[50:06] i guess we need to back off the promise
[50:09] when god ever gives a promise you never
[50:11] back off the promise she was thinking on
[50:15] this she raised up her little eyes
[50:17] she thought she saw a little flicker of
[50:19] light probably the guy was saying the
[50:21] little virgin perhaps rubs slowly
[50:23] you know how you do you think you see
[50:25] something and you maybe not
[50:26] a little reflection off of something and
[50:29] maybe it was her son reflecting off
[50:30] something and
[50:31] she just kept on walking pondering
[50:33] thinking about the scripture
[50:36] and when god put something on your heart
[50:39] he's ready to do something all right can
[50:42] i get an amen on him when god puts
[50:44] something on your heart
[50:46] he's ready to do something and maybe
[50:48] you're here this morning or this evening
[50:50] rather
[50:51] and something's on your heart maybe you
[50:54] have questions on your heart
[50:55] he's ready to do something maybe you're
[50:58] here tonight and you need healing or
[50:59] deliverance and it's weighing heavy on
[51:01] your heart
[51:02] he's here to do something maybe you're
[51:04] here this evening you've got a loved one
[51:05] on your heart in their way where maybe a
[51:07] son or a daughter
[51:08] or a situation but it's weighing heavy
[51:10] on your heart god is ready
[51:12] to do something because when god puts
[51:14] something on a believer's heart
[51:16] god is about to do something and i just
[51:18] wanted tonight if we can just
[51:19] press sin and believe that god will do
[51:22] what he declares he will do
[51:23] you will see the night the supernatural
[51:26] in our midst
[51:28] so bro joe i don't know how it's going
[51:29] to be mary didn't either
[51:34] she kept moving and walking and then she
[51:36] raised up her head again and
[51:37] all of a sudden stood this great light
[51:39] before and perhaps brother baby say the
[51:41] same pillar of fire
[51:42] that led the children of israel came
[51:45] walking from that light
[51:46] came this great art ain't our archangel
[51:49] gabriel and he said hail mary which
[51:51] means stop blessed are thou among women
[51:55] i mean god sent you an angel in this
[51:57] hour
[51:59] stop stop what you're doing stop where
[52:02] you've been going
[52:03] stop going to the denomination stop with
[52:05] all this out there
[52:06] because you're highly favored i got
[52:08] something special for you mary
[52:10] the present day mary i got something
[52:12] special for you i got a message for you
[52:15] inside of that womb is a promised son
[52:17] inside of you is going to bring forth
[52:19] life
[52:20] oh they said the days of miracles has
[52:21] passed but they don't know what i'm
[52:23] about to do
[52:24] let me tell you god has sent you a
[52:26] message and a messenger
[52:27] and he's about to do something one day
[52:29] these bodies are going to be changed
[52:32] well brother joe can you explain to me
[52:33] the scientific realm
[52:35] how my body is going to be changed no i
[52:37] can't but i know one thing god
[52:39] gave the promise and if god gave the
[52:41] promise god's got to keep the promise
[52:43] in the moment in the twinkling of an eye
[52:45] we're gonna be changing and raptured in
[52:47] his presence
[52:49] so don't get so caught up in the things
[52:51] that's going on around us
[52:54] put your focus on the things above put
[52:57] your focus on the things of god
[53:00] so she saw this great angel and it
[53:01] started a little virgin
[53:03] and she stopped and he came closer and
[53:05] he saluted her
[53:06] and he gave her a message and he said
[53:09] that was a hard message for that child
[53:11] to believe
[53:12] for she wasn't nothing but a girl and he
[53:15] gave her
[53:15] something to believe that was more
[53:18] outstanding
[53:19] and hard to believe than anything that
[53:22] he had given anyone before
[53:25] oh brother joe you don't know my
[53:26] situation
[53:29] okay mary
[53:34] you're going to bring forth a child not
[53:36] knowing the man
[53:38] let's do the mathematics on that one
[53:42] oh that'll blow your mind
[53:45] you want to talk about immaculate
[53:46] conception
[53:48] but god dated the promise and if god
[53:51] gave the promise god's got to back up
[53:53] the word
[53:56] so he gave her something harder than
[53:58] anybody ever before her had to believe
[54:01] it's never been done before here this
[54:03] little woman had to believe
[54:05] something that had never happened a
[54:07] woman having a baby without knowing a
[54:08] man
[54:10] no sarah was 90 years old before she can
[54:13] see
[54:14] but she knew abraham hannah she was old
[54:17] and waited for a child but she knew her
[54:19] husband
[54:19] but never before were there a woman to
[54:22] give forth life
[54:23] not knowing a man but yet god said it
[54:26] and god brought it to pass and he's as
[54:28] very much god tonight for your situation
[54:30] as he was for mary if you can just do
[54:33] what mary didn't say behold
[54:34] your handmaid lord be it unto me
[54:37] according to thy word
[54:38] i'll believe it i'll testify i'll
[54:40] proclaim this word
[54:41] though it may be strange to the ears of
[54:43] everybody else god i believe you tonight
[54:49] she didn't question it she said behold
[54:52] the hand made of the lord be it unto me
[54:53] according to thy word
[54:55] and if we could do just that that's the
[54:58] only thing that's what god loves
[55:00] that's the only way to get right with
[55:02] god is to take him at his word
[55:04] that's the only way that there is to
[55:05] please god is take him
[55:07] at his word don't trust in your
[55:09] knowledge your reason
[55:11] how can it be done it cannot be done he
[55:13] says and when you reason then you lose
[55:15] the victory
[55:17] how many you've ever reasoned yourself
[55:18] out of a promise
[55:22] well we don't want to admit that but we
[55:24] have what we all have
[55:27] we all have but it didn't mean that the
[55:30] promise is not there
[55:32] god gave the promise and a lot of times
[55:35] we allow a reason but the bible that's
[55:36] why he would put in there to cast down
[55:38] imaginations
[55:39] cast down every high thing that exalts
[55:41] itself against the knowledge of god
[55:43] bring it into captivity
[55:45] every thought you got to bring that
[55:46] thought captive to the obedience of
[55:49] christ
[55:50] so mary took him at his word and he
[55:52] changed her whole
[55:54] course of her natural life
[55:59] he changed her whole course of her
[56:02] natural life
[56:03] and if he can do that for mary what can
[56:05] he do for this mary
[56:08] this marriage promised a rapture this
[56:11] marriage promised a body change
[56:12] never been done before but it don't mean
[56:15] that it's not going to be done
[56:18] oh but mary when is she beginning to
[56:20] testify what god what the angel just
[56:22] told her
[56:23] what about us oh we don't want nobody to
[56:26] know what we believe we don't want
[56:28] nobody know we're believing for a
[56:29] rapture we're believing for a body
[56:30] change
[56:31] we're believing like sarah she's going
[56:32] to be turned back and knowing all these
[56:34] things and yet
[56:35] god gave the promise and the bible to
[56:38] god said he will change the course of
[56:40] your life tonight
[56:41] if you'll take him at his word how many
[56:44] you gotta need tonight
[56:47] god will change the course of your life
[56:49] if you can take him at his word

[58:30] how can cancer be cured
[58:32] when the doctors give it up it's not me
[58:34] to try to figure it out
[58:36] is take god at his word he was the one
[58:39] that made the promise
[58:41] and he's the one who has to confirm that
[58:42] promise he's obligated
[58:45] to the promise so god is obligated to
[58:49] the problems notice
[58:50] the problem god will tell us god doesn't
[58:52] have to heal just to heal
[58:54] but he has to heal to fulfill his word
[58:57] because his word declares him that he's
[59:00] a healer
[59:02] so why do we back off when our bodies
[59:04] are stricken in pain and agony and
[59:06] despair
[59:09] see mary she did not wait till she felt
[59:12] positive
[59:14] she did not wait till she felt life or
[59:16] some kind of physical sign you know how
[59:18] oh this just drives me nuts you know how
[59:21] these ladies
[59:22] these young ladies because some of you
[59:23] older ladies don't go through this
[59:25] anymore
[59:25] but when they get pregnant for the first
[59:27] time
[59:30] that's the most ridiculous thing i've
[59:32] ever seen let me tell you no fat lady
[59:33] sticks out her stomach like
[59:34] and says look at me but you let him get
[59:37] pain and get a little bump first thing
[59:39] they do is
[59:41] she didn't wait and stand in the mirror
[59:43] before she began to testify
[59:44] of what god was going to do she wasn't
[59:47] waiting for the baby bump she'd
[59:48] have been bumped by an angel that angel
[59:51] bumped into her on her road to the water
[59:53] and she said oh hell
[59:54] mary they are highly favored among women
[59:57] inside of you is going to bring forth
[59:58] life
[59:59] not knowing a man you're going to bring
[1:00:01] forth the supernatural
[1:00:02] and his name is going to be called jesus
[1:00:04] christ he's the king of kings
[1:00:06] the lord of lord he's a mighty god he's
[1:00:08] an everlasting father
[1:00:10] he's the brides i am and he's who i am
[1:00:12] tonight whatever your need is
[1:00:14] gotta meet that need tonight
[1:00:18] she didn't wait till she felt something
[1:00:19] she didn't wait till she saw a bump
[1:00:23] she went out testifying i bet an angel
[1:00:27] let me tell you i met a messenger oh i
[1:00:30] met a messenger
[1:00:31] let me tell you he came with a message
[1:00:33] not like anybody else to come before him
[1:00:36] oh he's not just a messenger he's a
[1:00:37] seventh angel
[1:00:39] and what did that seventh angel tell you
[1:00:40] oh he told me he took the seals off the
[1:00:42] back of the book
[1:00:43] i've looked in i see my name there he
[1:00:46] told me i come from god
[1:00:47] i'm going back to god i don't understand
[1:00:49] it brother joe all i see is generational
[1:00:51] curses but i'm going to tell you
[1:00:53] god buried those generational curses
[1:00:54] when they ripped the seals up and showed
[1:00:56] you your name
[1:00:57] you come from god you're going back to
[1:00:59] god
[1:01:03] god's word was good enough for her and
[1:01:05] she started rejoicing right away
[1:01:09] and if it was good enough for mary it's
[1:01:11] got to be good enough for us
[1:01:13] why wouldn't we want to believe the word
[1:01:15] why wouldn't we want our faith elevated
[1:01:19] notice now mary had to believe something
[1:01:21] that had never
[1:01:22] happened before no woman had ever
[1:01:25] brought a child like that into the world
[1:01:27] not knowing a man he said you take god
[1:01:30] at his word believe it anyhow no matter
[1:01:32] how
[1:01:32] impossible it looks to believe believe
[1:01:35] god
[1:01:36] he will bring it to pass and we find in
[1:01:39] mark 9 verse 23 through
[1:01:41] excuse me 23 jesus said unto him if thou
[1:01:45] canst believe then all things are
[1:01:47] possible
[1:01:48] to him that believeth and that's where i
[1:01:51] want to draw my
[1:01:52] context tonight all things are possible
[1:01:55] to him to him to him to him
[1:01:58] to him to him to him that will believe
[1:02:02] let me tell you this is not a man
[1:02:04] message
[1:02:05] this is not william brandon's message
[1:02:08] this is not brother ben's message
[1:02:10] brother joe's message brother tim donny
[1:02:12] put your favorite preacher there
[1:02:14] it's not their message this is god's
[1:02:17] message
[1:02:17] that he brought down we're just the
[1:02:19] angel we're just a servant
[1:02:21] that's bumping into the bride to tell
[1:02:24] her where she's going
[1:02:25] where she come from let me tell you and
[1:02:27] it's that today and if you can receive
[1:02:29] it like mary received it then you'll
[1:02:31] bring forth that same promised word
[1:02:33] and for your life
[1:02:36] problem said here in the possession the
[1:02:38] gate of the enemy said god is true to
[1:02:40] his promise
[1:02:40] no matter what he has to do bankrupt the
[1:02:43] heavens before he will let
[1:02:45] one word of his go defeated
[1:02:48] he never made a promise that he can't
[1:02:50] keep
[1:02:52] i'm the lord that heals all about
[1:02:53] diseases if they lay your hands on the
[1:02:55] sick they shall recover

[1:04:25] so i just stole it put it in here but
[1:04:26] he said now the word priest actually
[1:04:29] demonstrated itself

[1:04:33] the conscience of men
[1:04:34] like a surgeon's knife he cut out
[1:04:36] diseases it set the captives free
[1:04:39] everywhere those early believers went
[1:04:41] they went preaching the gospel the word
[1:04:43] and god confirmed that word with signs
[1:04:47] following
[1:04:48] not just jesus but everywhere those
[1:04:51] early believers went
[1:04:52] the word went with signs following the
[1:04:55] sick were healed devils were cast out
[1:04:57] they spoke in tongues that was the word
[1:05:00] in action
[1:05:01] and he said that word has never failed
[1:05:04] in the mouth of believing christians let
[1:05:06] me tell you it ain't gonna fall tonight
[1:05:08] if i can get you to confess that word
[1:05:10] that god is able and he's bigger than
[1:05:12] your enemy no matter what you're going
[1:05:14] through if you can take that word
[1:05:16] on your lips tonight you'll see devils
[1:05:18] fall you'll see demons back up
[1:05:20] you'll see almighty god on display
[1:05:24] that word never failed in the mouths of
[1:05:26] believing christians and in this last
[1:05:28] age it has
[1:05:29] it is here stronger and greater than
[1:05:32] ever to the true word bride
[1:05:34] stronger and greater to the true word
[1:05:38] bride

[1:05:46] kingdom
[1:05:48] oh be it unto me lord be it unto me lord
[1:05:51] i don't understand everything i don't
[1:05:52] know how you're going to figure it all
[1:05:53] out god
[1:05:54] but that word has never failed it's
[1:05:57] never failed now listen
[1:05:59] in the message the resurrection of
[1:06:01] lazarus
[1:06:03] brother would tell us he says now if we
[1:06:05] become in the spirit
[1:06:06] sons of god then deity dwells in the man
[1:06:12] you look at yourself in the morning you
[1:06:14] didn't get how many you looked in the
[1:06:15] mirror when you got ready
[1:06:17] y'all didn't we can tell it's okay you
[1:06:20] may want to buy one of those
[1:06:22] and look at mama that's me yeah
[1:06:25] but you get up in the mirror and you
[1:06:26] look when you got up and looked at it
[1:06:29] you wasn't thinking man look at that
[1:06:32] deity
[1:06:34] no you were looking oh man i'm losing my
[1:06:37] hair
[1:06:38] i can't get this thing to lay down you
[1:06:40] thinking man i don't put on some weight
[1:06:42] this dress honey doesn't stretch don't
[1:06:44] even answer
[1:06:45] and get yourself in some serious trouble
[1:06:48] oh we look at these things we don't
[1:06:49] think but the problem of god will tell
[1:06:51] us
[1:06:51] he said if we become the spirit sons of
[1:06:54] god
[1:06:55] deity dwells in the man then you talk
[1:06:58] about blind eyes being
[1:07:00] open they said nothing impossible with
[1:07:02] god but god
[1:07:03] said nothing impossible with you that's
[1:07:06] a quote from your prophet
[1:07:07] we want to put it on god but god is
[1:07:09] putting it back on you tonight
[1:07:11] if you can only believe nothing is
[1:07:13] impossible tonight
[1:07:14] or we look at god and we see the
[1:07:16] supernatural but god is looking at his
[1:07:18] bride and he wants to see the
[1:07:19] supernatural
[1:07:22] oh hallelujah you talk about blind eyes
[1:07:25] being open they said nothing impossible
[1:07:27] with god
[1:07:28] god said nothing impossible with you if
[1:07:30] you believe not with god but with you
[1:07:33] deities in the man so next time when you
[1:07:36] get up in the morning i want you to look
[1:07:38] in that mirror and say
[1:07:39] good morning deity i got this covered
[1:07:45] my brother joe i don't want to i don't
[1:07:47] want to lift myself up no
[1:07:48] you didn't make yourself that now god
[1:07:52] made you what you are
[1:07:54] he said the very god that stood back
[1:07:56] there on the mystical
[1:07:57] or the mythical platform of the eternity
[1:07:59] and he's rolled the world off his hands
[1:08:01] and he created these things he give you
[1:08:03] the privilege
[1:08:04] to be his son
[1:08:09] oh and you're part of him and god dwells
[1:08:11] in mankind
[1:08:12] and man himself is deity
[1:08:16] so i want you to look at your neighbor
[1:08:19] say hey deity
[1:08:22] oh you just felt uncomfortable didn't
[1:08:23] you because you didn't see deity you saw
[1:08:26] the natural
[1:08:27] but see if you can see the way god sees
[1:08:29] you can look through the eyes of
[1:08:31] of the spirit and not through the eyes
[1:08:32] of your flesh and not through the eyes
[1:08:34] of a finite man
[1:08:35] you look and look at your neighbor and
[1:08:36] your brother say you know what they've
[1:08:38] gone through a lot of hardships but
[1:08:39] that's deity because they're still
[1:08:40] standing when the devils threw this set
[1:08:42] up and they do that at them he told them
[1:08:44] they wasn't going to make it he's going
[1:08:45] to give up
[1:08:46] and just throw in the towel they're
[1:08:47] still there why because then he's in the
[1:08:49] man
[1:08:50] and that word holds on to the word and
[1:08:52] it trusts god no matter how they feel no
[1:08:54] matter what they're going through
[1:08:55] it hangs on to the problem and says
[1:08:57] being unto me god
[1:08:58] i don't understand why i'm here i don't
[1:09:00] understand why i'm going through this
[1:09:02] trial
[1:09:02] but oh god be it unto me tonight let the
[1:09:05] word be
[1:09:06] formed in me
[1:09:09] he says that same power that same christ
[1:09:12] hallelujah let the fundamentalists
[1:09:14] let them the people that deny the power
[1:09:16] of god say it's wrong
[1:09:17] but that same power that spoke the world
[1:09:19] into existence is in those people that's
[1:09:22] got the holy ghost
[1:09:24] let that drop in your mind
[1:09:28] you think you're a little nobody you
[1:09:30] think you're a little coward down
[1:09:31] something
[1:09:32] you think well i don't know my position
[1:09:34] i don't know my place god said the same
[1:09:36] power
[1:09:37] that was in the creator that formed the
[1:09:39] world he said that same deity that did
[1:09:42] that
[1:09:42] is in you right here tonight
[1:09:46] so if that same power's here that same
[1:09:48] person is here
[1:09:49] that same deity is here then can't we
[1:09:51] create an atmosphere tonight
[1:09:53] can't we create an atmosphere tonight oh
[1:09:55] brother joe you don't understand i'm
[1:09:56] tired that's all right
[1:09:58] push through tonight deity's here it's
[1:10:00] here in your life it's here in your
[1:10:02] situation
[1:10:02] that i'm gonna press through tonight and
[1:10:04] gotta expect god to do the supernatural
[1:10:09] he said deities and man the very god
[1:10:11] that stood back there
[1:10:13] on that mythical platform of the
[1:10:14] attorneys rolled off
[1:10:16] of his hands and created those things he
[1:10:18] give you the privilege
[1:10:20] to be his son what a privilege we are
[1:10:22] given
[1:10:24] and god dwells in mankind and man
[1:10:27] himself
[1:10:28] is deity and that same power that same
[1:10:31] christ hallelujah
[1:10:32] let the fundamentalists let the people
[1:10:34] who deny the power of god
[1:10:35] let them say it's wrong but that same
[1:10:37] power that spoke the world into
[1:10:39] existence
[1:10:39] is in those people that's got the holy
[1:10:41] ghost men and women it's time that you
[1:10:43] found out who you are
[1:10:44] the devil's trying to hide you back
[1:10:46] trying to tell you that you're some
[1:10:47] little coward down something
[1:10:48] you're not you're sons and daughters of
[1:10:50] god did he's not in heaven
[1:10:52] then he's in you tonight oh quit looking
[1:10:55] up to heaven

[1:10:57] at your favorite preacher and look to
[1:10:59] you tonight
[1:11:00] did he's in hell it's in you tonight
[1:11:02] that same god that spoke the world
[1:11:04] he's living right there brother john
[1:11:06] he's in your heart
[1:11:09] so if that did he's there then we got a
[1:11:11] responsibility
[1:11:12] to take god at his word to believe and
[1:11:15] to call those things or not
[1:11:16] as though they are
[1:11:20] inside of each of you that's here
[1:11:21] tonight is the ability to change the
[1:11:24] situation
[1:11:26] how do i do it you pray and you hold god
[1:11:28] responsible to his word
[1:11:30] he wants you to pray and the prophet of
[1:11:33] god said he wants you to ask for big
[1:11:35] things
[1:11:36] because big things are just as easy to
[1:11:38] come to pass
[1:11:39] is small things he said don't limit your
[1:11:42] faith
[1:11:43] to these little mustard seeds oh let
[1:11:46] your faith loose tonight church

[1:12:38] the ability to create he said it
[1:12:42] lays within every believer right now is
[1:12:44] the power to create another world
[1:12:46] and go live on it to create
[1:12:50] another world and go live on it
[1:12:54] remember god has a purpose you and that
[1:12:57] problem
[1:12:58] is going to get the answer that he's
[1:12:59] looking for
[1:13:02] you may not understand it god's not
[1:13:05] asking you to understand it
[1:13:06] god is asking you to believe it
[1:13:09] notice the bible tells us colossians 1
[1:13:11] 26 even the mystery which has been
[1:13:13] hidden from the ages from generations
[1:13:15] but now is made manifest to his saints
[1:13:19] to whom god will make known his riches
[1:13:21] of his glory
[1:13:22] among the mystery among the gentiles
[1:13:24] which is christ
[1:13:26] in you there's the mystery
[1:13:31] i'm afraid that the denominations don't
[1:13:33] get this
[1:13:35] oh because it's not for everybody it's
[1:13:37] for the predestinated
[1:13:38] for the ones that god foresaw god for
[1:13:41] knew the ones that god placed a seed on
[1:13:43] the inside
[1:13:44] before there was a foundation in the
[1:13:45] world that's the mystery
[1:13:47] but the bible tells us now that mystery
[1:13:50] is being made manifest
[1:13:51] because how because they can take that
[1:13:53] word through the seventh angels message
[1:13:55] and make that word manifest and say lord
[1:13:58] that's nothing but the truth
[1:14:01] how can we create squirrels it's not for
[1:14:03] you to create growth but hanny wright
[1:14:05] had the right answer
[1:14:06] oh i believe it that's nothing but the
[1:14:08] truth and when she said that the angel
[1:14:10] of the lord came down
[1:14:11] and said tell her she can have anything
[1:14:13] that she has
[1:14:15] she could have had money she was poor
[1:14:17] she could have had her sister here she
[1:14:18] was sick
[1:14:19] but what did she ask for the salvation
[1:14:21] of her boys
[1:14:22] because god knew that she was she was
[1:14:24] going to do with the promise
[1:14:26] and god knows what you're going to do
[1:14:27] with that same promise
[1:14:29] but come on hattie you got to have the
[1:14:31] right response to the word
[1:14:33] recognize the mystery of christ is in
[1:14:35] you almighty god to create our heavens
[1:14:37] and earth the universe
[1:14:38] is dwelling in you christ in you can
[1:14:40] overcome anything
[1:14:42] and everything that you face
[1:14:45] so if there is in you tonight then i say
[1:14:48] it's time we start believing
[1:14:50] i say it's time we start expecting i say
[1:14:52] it's time we start speaking
[1:14:54] you know how many we we we got a lot of
[1:14:56] negativity don't we
[1:14:59] well we found ourselves bumping into
[1:15:00] some kind of situation the first thing
[1:15:02] we don't go right straight to god no we
[1:15:04] go straight to our own flesh and
[1:15:06] we deny why me why did this happen and
[1:15:09] it always happens if i had any luck it'd
[1:15:11] be
[1:15:11] bad luck you know what i mean we how
[1:15:13] many has ever said that don't raise your
[1:15:14] hand
[1:15:15] you raise your hand back here don't do
[1:15:16] it let me finish
[1:15:19] i'll give you opportunity respond but
[1:15:22] that's our human nature some of us are
[1:15:23] more negative than others
[1:15:25] but god is asking you tonight put that
[1:15:27] negativity aside
[1:15:28] look to the word look to the promise
[1:15:31] look to what he's declared in this hour
[1:15:33] god is sending us the seventh angel look
[1:15:35] that's to do something for you
[1:15:37] to change your body to give you rapture
[1:15:39] and faith for rapturing grace because
[1:15:41] we're in the extreme hour
[1:15:43] and god is about to turn this thing
[1:15:45] loose and this bride is going to be
[1:15:47] changed

[1:16:13] and it's impossible
[1:16:15] but i believe it anyway oh first john 3

[1:16:26] i'm not a teacher you realize that and
[1:16:29] he said yep
[1:16:32] behold what manner of love the father
[1:16:35] has bestowed upon us
[1:16:37] that we should be called sons of god
[1:16:41] therefore the world knoweth us not
[1:16:45] because it knew him not beloved now

[1:17:25] of hardy i mean
[1:17:26] really who cares to be on the chamber
[1:17:27] board of hardy
[1:17:29] who cares to be the most famous one in
[1:17:30] hearty ark so i don't care
[1:17:32] you shouldn't care but i'm gonna tell
[1:17:34] you tonight your name has been engraved
[1:17:36] on the palms of his hand
[1:17:37] he puts you in the lamb's book a lot and
[1:17:39] ain't no devil
[1:17:40] ain't no treatment ain't no temptation
[1:17:42] ain't no situation
[1:17:44] can't remove that name if you just
[1:17:45] recognize your sons of god
[1:17:48] beloved now you are the sons of god he
[1:17:50] ain't just putting anybody's name there
[1:17:52] he's putting sons and daughters name
[1:17:54] there
[1:17:57] and as a son you have the authority over
[1:18:00] the devil
[1:18:04] he says now the sons and daughters who
[1:18:06] has the most power
[1:18:07] before god what is an angel an angel is
[1:18:10] a servant
[1:18:12] but when i read this of course i read it
[1:18:13] many years ago and i was young in my
[1:18:15] faith
[1:18:16] how about did a cartwheel could have
[1:18:17] broke my neck
[1:18:20] but you realize you realize man god has
[1:18:24] made you a son
[1:18:25] brother dale i didn't make you a son you
[1:18:27] didn't make me a son
[1:18:28] you and i could have a fallen out you
[1:18:30] could put me in one day and put me out
[1:18:31] the next
[1:18:32] but god doesn't do that god doesn't
[1:18:34] operate the way we operate
[1:18:36] god doesn't draw the short end of the
[1:18:38] stick and say well i guess i'll take the
[1:18:40] leftovers
[1:18:40] no god before there ever was a world
[1:18:42] before there ever was a foundation
[1:18:44] god saw you he saw your need he knew
[1:18:47] that you'd be saved so he put your name
[1:18:49] there
[1:18:49] and now you are the sons and daughters
[1:18:51] of god and ain't nothing can remove that
[1:18:54] name
[1:18:54] ain't enough demon ain't enough trials
[1:18:56] ain't enough disappointments can't take
[1:18:58] your name off of that book
[1:19:01] he says now sons and daughters has some
[1:19:03] who has the most power
[1:19:04] before god an angel an angel is a
[1:19:06] servant that's right there is service
[1:19:08] what are you you're his son and his
[1:19:10] daughter who has the most power in
[1:19:12] heaven
[1:19:12] then a sinner that's been saved by grace
[1:19:15] or an archangel that's standing beside
[1:19:18] him he said the sinner that's been saved
[1:19:20] by grace
[1:19:21] has more authority in heaven than the
[1:19:23] archangel that stood by his side
[1:19:25] without sin because he's a son
[1:19:29] a son has more authority than the
[1:19:31] servant of course
[1:19:32] but he says sometimes we forget what we
[1:19:35] are
[1:19:38] we forget many times what made us what
[1:19:41] we
[1:19:42] are after we become what we are then we
[1:19:45] forget
[1:19:46] how we got there well if you don't get
[1:19:48] anything out of this message tonight i
[1:19:50] want you to take home i'm a son
[1:19:52] and i'm a daughter of god i didn't put
[1:19:55] my name there no preacher put my name
[1:19:57] there the prophet didn't put my name
[1:19:58] there
[1:19:59] god put my name there and if god saw fit
[1:20:02] to put my name there that's declaring to
[1:20:04] me that no matter what i face on this
[1:20:05] side of attorney no matter what devil he
[1:20:07] throws against me no matter what
[1:20:09] sickness comes against me no matter what

[1:20:12] or my home or my family there's no way
[1:20:15] that i'm gonna be defeated i can't lose
[1:20:17] because god can't lose and god put it

[1:20:35] be formed in my heart
[1:20:36] let the word have its way through my
[1:20:38] life
[1:20:39] let me manifest the true word of this
[1:20:42] hour
[1:20:45] so no matter how you feel no matter how
[1:20:48] significant you may think you are won't
[1:20:50] you ever forget your bride

[1:20:56] bright bright and bright
[1:21:00] not just anyone can receive that
[1:21:02] distinction
[1:21:03] it's only for the predestinated
[1:21:09] and god has given you that's here
[1:21:12] tonight power over your enemy
[1:21:16] i don't know about you but there were
[1:21:18] some raptors in here i think i'd be
[1:21:19] swinging right now
[1:21:22] i got power i got power over complexes
[1:21:25] i got power over depression i got power
[1:21:27] over fears i got power over situations
[1:21:30] i got power over torment and spirits i
[1:21:32] got
[1:21:33] power oh brother joe well you know why
[1:21:36] is because you go to 10 pruitt's church
[1:21:38] it had nothing to do with tim pruitt
[1:21:40] tim pruitt didn't give me power jesus
[1:21:42] christ gave me the power
[1:21:44] jesus christ put my name on the book
[1:21:46] jesus christ declared me a son
[1:21:47] let me tell you that shame jesus is here
[1:21:49] tonight making the same declaration
[1:21:52] and if you can believe that same word of
[1:21:53] promise nothing will be impossible to
[1:21:55] you
[1:21:58] the problem says now we must believe
[1:22:02] he says you must believe what you asked
[1:22:04] for if you are a believer recognize
[1:22:06] yourself
[1:22:07] as a believer recognize that these
[1:22:10] things are for you
[1:22:13] if you abide in me and my word in you
[1:22:15] then ask what you will
[1:22:17] if you have god the word in you and you
[1:22:19] believe the word just as
[1:22:20] you believe god because it's god and
[1:22:22] it's inseparable he says then if you
[1:22:24] have god's word in you and you have
[1:22:26] god's life in you
[1:22:28] you have god and you and whatsoever
[1:22:30] god's word speaks forth
[1:22:31] out of you it has to come to pass just
[1:22:34] like it was spoke from god
[1:22:38] when the believer takes that word places
[1:22:41] it upon his lips
[1:22:42] and speaks it's the same as jesus
[1:22:46] speaking
[1:22:48] oh come on church we talk about word of
[1:22:51] life
[1:22:53] oh you're talking about power over the
[1:22:55] enemy the authority over the enemy
[1:22:58] god has placed inside of you tonight
[1:23:00] that's hearing the sound of this voice
[1:23:02] god has given you that power and if you
[1:23:04] just take that name
[1:23:05] and you take that word and you take that
[1:23:08] promise and you're going to speak to
[1:23:09] your mountain
[1:23:10] your mountain has to move your mouth and
[1:23:12] has to hear your voice
[1:23:13] what's everything you desire when you
[1:23:16] pray you'll see god back that up
[1:23:18] he'll bankrupt heavens and earth just to
[1:23:20] make sure that that word don't fall to
[1:23:22] the ground
[1:23:26] he said do you realize if we go before
[1:23:28] god in the name of jesus
[1:23:30] is just the same as jesus himself
[1:23:32] praying
[1:23:34] oh my as far as i know everything that
[1:23:37] jesus asked for in the bible he got
[1:23:41] it's time we start asking but before you
[1:23:44] can ask you got to believe
[1:23:45] and before you can believe you got to
[1:23:47] expect so there's
[1:23:48] there's a there's a process we got to go
[1:23:50] through church but if i can get your
[1:23:52] faith
[1:23:54] to believe if i can raise that faith to
[1:23:57] yours up tonight to get you past what
[1:23:59] you're going through
[1:24:00] and you can look beyond at the end of
[1:24:01] your trial you'll see a supernatural
[1:24:04] you'll see a victorious son and daughter
[1:24:06] of god
[1:24:08] he says now and then we got to receive
[1:24:10] what we asked for
[1:24:12] because he said it and if god's own word
[1:24:15] it can't do nothing else but produce
[1:24:18] what it said god's word can't do
[1:24:20] anything else but produce exactly what
[1:24:22] it said
[1:24:24] but it takes having the mind that was in
[1:24:26] christ so mary didn't wait till she felt
[1:24:29] something positive
[1:24:30] she began to testify i'm gonna have a
[1:24:33] child
[1:24:34] you and joseph are not married yet i
[1:24:36] know that
[1:24:38] imagine the shame that was she was
[1:24:41] willing to bear
[1:24:42] for the promise imagine the shame
[1:24:46] my joseph and you decided to keep her
[1:24:49] joseph had to walk by faith as well
[1:24:53] because he was much tied to the promises
[1:24:54] mary was
[1:24:56] i had a brother write me soon after i
[1:24:59] preached that first message that i
[1:25:00] preached this morning but this was of
[1:25:02] course a while back
[1:25:03] he said brother joe i just had to write
[1:25:04] you to give you my testimony after
[1:25:06] watching the message
[1:25:08] impossible math he said i've received my
[1:25:10] healing from parkinson's disease
[1:25:13] which i've had for over three years
[1:25:16] yes the doctors proclaim that there is
[1:25:18] no cure for the disease
[1:25:19] look how simple it came when i viewed
[1:25:22] the complex math problem on the wall
[1:25:24] behind you
[1:25:24] i knew i couldn't touch it yet i knew
[1:25:27] and i believed that there was an answer
[1:25:29] to the problem
[1:25:31] it was then that i realized in my finite
[1:25:33] puny mind that just because
[1:25:34] i didn't have an have or understand the
[1:25:37] answer to the problem didn't mean that
[1:25:38] one didn't exist
[1:25:40] how great is our god that he loves to
[1:25:42] take the most difficult problems
[1:25:44] and saw them how that ought to increase
[1:25:46] our faith
[1:25:47] he says share this with the congregation
[1:25:49] because i'm about ready to dance
[1:25:52] my brother joe we don't like dancing in
[1:25:54] the church
[1:25:57] we don't believe in all that shouting we
[1:25:59] don't think you got to do all that we
[1:26:01] need to have church order now probably
[1:26:03] god said that you know what we need
[1:26:04] church order but we need to get out of
[1:26:06] order
[1:26:06] long enough to get saved so i'm telling
[1:26:09] you we don't went so far in that ditch
[1:26:11] of formalism that we can't shout we
[1:26:12] can't say amen we can't even nod our
[1:26:14] heads to the word of god
[1:26:16] let me tell you this man been delivered
[1:26:18] from parkinson's disease
[1:26:19] for three years the doctors gave him up
[1:26:21] they said he'd get to live the rest of
[1:26:23] his life
[1:26:23] but god supernaturally came down because
[1:26:26] he believed
[1:26:27] he believed that the word was for him
[1:26:29] and if you can believe tonight
[1:26:30] that same work is for you it can heal
[1:26:33] parkinson's
[1:26:34] it can heal cancer it can heal brain
[1:26:36] bleeds nothing's impossible with you
[1:26:38] if you can believe
[1:26:41] abraham says i believe every patient in
[1:26:43] the building right now would accept it
[1:26:45] upon the grounds of
[1:26:46] god's word and believing and start
[1:26:47] testifying and praising god for healing
[1:26:49] this meeting went close
[1:26:51] with one crippled person in here that's
[1:26:53] right god is under obligation

[1:29:01] able to put hair
[1:29:02] back in the little girl's head why

[1:29:09] believed nothing is incurable with god
[1:29:12] next picture look at her hair's growing
[1:29:15] out

[1:29:22] oh next picture
[1:29:27] this one may be hard to see this is
[1:29:30] sister karen pruitt
[1:29:33] she woke up to go to the restroom and
[1:29:35] experience had a severe headache
[1:29:37] brother tim decided to take her to the
[1:29:38] er because she already had a couple of
[1:29:40] brain bleeds before then
[1:29:41] and on the way to the hospital she began
[1:29:43] to vomit and get worse
[1:29:44] george she couldn't talk and she was
[1:29:46] unresponsive and due to cover 19 they
[1:29:48] wouldn't let brother tim back with her
[1:29:50] so brother timothy he called me said
[1:29:51] brother joe you work at the hospital
[1:29:53] do you mind getting up and going and
[1:29:54] praying for mom and you know just
[1:29:56] checking on and seeing what's going on
[1:29:58] so i decided to get up and i went and i
[1:30:00] stayed with her until they transferred
[1:30:02] to a bigger facility
[1:30:03] and i went to the doctor an er physician
[1:30:06] i said doc
[1:30:07] i said you know how bad is this how bad
[1:30:11] is this situation
[1:30:14] because she's already had two and his
[1:30:16] response to me was brother joe or
[1:30:18] not brother joe but he said joe he says
[1:30:20] she can live another five minutes
[1:30:23] or she can live another five years but
[1:30:26] if she does she will not have a quality
[1:30:28] of life
[1:30:29] pretty much at this moment she was in a
[1:30:31] vegetable state
[1:30:33] i went in and i laid my hands on and
[1:30:35] began to pray for uh
[1:30:37] not notice him but i put my hand on her
[1:30:38] head and it happened to be the side that
[1:30:40] had
[1:30:40] the brain so what happened she had a
[1:30:42] midline shift she had a brain bleed on
[1:30:44] one side
[1:30:45] and it filled up and pushed her brain
[1:30:47] over to the other side of her head
[1:30:49] and it made her unconscious or made her
[1:30:51] in the vegetable state
[1:30:53] but the family began to pray
[1:30:56] so we finally looked and the night
[1:30:59] before that i preached on the message
[1:31:00] god does impossible math
[1:31:02] and she told brother tim on the way home
[1:31:04] that night he said brother joe preached
[1:31:06] that for you
[1:31:07] not knowing what they were about to go
[1:31:08] through but god knows
[1:31:11] god knows how to elevate your faith god
[1:31:13] knows the deepest darkest hours that
[1:31:14] you're going to face
[1:31:15] and god's already provided and we find
[1:31:18] here after a few short days sister karen
[1:31:20] they did an emergency surgery brain
[1:31:22] surgery they removed all the blood from
[1:31:24] her
[1:31:24] and yet she was still unresponsive but
[1:31:27] within two or three days
[1:31:28] brother tim came in and he prayed he
[1:31:30] said god when i walk in that room
[1:31:32] i want her to respond to me and they
[1:31:34] have a little code they squeeze each
[1:31:35] other's hand three times i love you
[1:31:37] and he goes in there and he begins to
[1:31:38] talk to her karen can you hear me
[1:31:42] karen do you know i love you she's again
[1:31:44] squeezing his hands she was supposed to
[1:31:46] be in a vegetable state
[1:31:47] she was supposed to be unresponsive she
[1:31:49] was not supposed to have a quality of
[1:31:51] life
[1:31:51] but god began to move because they
[1:31:54] believed
[1:31:54] that the promise was for them and if you
[1:31:56] look at the next picture
[1:31:58] you'll see what god's able to do there
[1:32:00] she is at the virginia meetings
[1:32:02] shouting and praising god she wasn't
[1:32:04] supposed to walk she wasn't supposed to
[1:32:06] talk

[1:32:28] exceeding abundantly
[1:32:29] above all that we can even ask or three
[1:32:32] and the greatest compliment
[1:32:34] that you can give god tonight is to take
[1:32:36] him at his word
[1:32:38] you don't have to figure it all out
[1:32:39] church god's not asking you to
[1:32:42] he's just asking you to believe mary

[1:32:47] but she said lord be it unto me
[1:32:50] be it unto me according to your word
[1:32:54] and the prophet of god will say as soon
