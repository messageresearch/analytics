"A Revival in an Exodus" Bro Joel Pruitt 1-11-26 Sunday Night
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
purpose the Holy Spirit led you here &gt;&gt; God leads even his animal life. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Here not long ago you might have heard it in the magazines. I love wild animals. And um I was sitting on my porch with my student ministers down here, Mr. Mercer and Mr. Gold. I the tape boys and they come up there and we talk. was sitting on the porch speaking about last July early one morning coming down the road come an old possum and she was crawling along and come all past four houses that didn't have any fences or gates and come to mind it had a fence and a gate and turned in I said I know anyone knows animal life has studied it aposums blind in the daytime they prowl at night and I said look at her. She's probably got rabies. And uh Mr. Wood here, the book salesman, he had been out in the yard rake in there. So he there's a yard rake laying there. And I took the yard rake and went out throw over the old possum. And I said, "Well, I suppose." I said, "Oh, look. Her left shoulder was all broke, mashed up, been chewed by the dogs or by a car, and I hope this doesn't make you sick, but maggots is all over it and green blowflies." I said, "Poor old things are dying." And I happened to notice and I started to raise that up and she was usually they play possum. But when I raised it up, she took out for the house. I threw it rake over again, a yard rake. And I found out that she there's only two animals in the world that has pockets. That's kangaroo and possum. They pack their little ones in it. So when her pocket let down, she had nine little naked baby possums about that long. Well, the day before that, Leo and Jean and I were talking a piece in the paper where a young lovely looking color girl had given birth to a baby, a illegitimate child. She wrapped it in a blanket and put wire around it and smothered the child to death, tuck it out on the bridge in a taxi cab and dropped it off in the river. The authorities had caught it. We were talking about how cruel that was. And I said, "This mother possum is a better mother being a dumb brute than that woman was." That's right. Got better morals than that woman. And so we were talking and Mr. Woods come up and Mrs. Woods and Mr. Gilmore, he come in. We was talking about it. Soon as I let that possum up, she tuck off towards the house as hard as she could go. And I said, "Look, she's only got about maybe 30 minutes for to live, but she'll spend that 30 minutes fighting for those little babies to live. And that woman won't drown hers." I said, "That's real motherly love." So the poor old thing got right up to my steps and toppled over exhausted. So I went there and I punched her. I said, "She's dead." I seen her after punch. I said, "No, she's got life in her." Well, Mrs. Woods, Mr. Woods's wife's sort of a veterary. She was standing there. She said, "Well, Brother Brandham, the only thing to do with her now is is go kill her and kill them little possums." Said, "They're too little to round mouth anyhow. You couldn't put them on a bottle." Said, "You just don't let them suffer." And there was a little possibility trying to nurse that dead mother. And I said, "Oh my, that's too bad." I said, "Kill her?" Said, "Yes." "Oh." I said, "I can't kill her." And he said, I said, "Well, why?" I said, "I don't know." She said, "Well, you're a hunter." I said, "Yes, but I'm not a killer." I said, "I I can't kill her somehow." She said, 'Well, let my husband Banks go kill her. Said, "Go get one of your guns and kill her. And I said, 'I just can't do it. I don't know why. I said, 'You going to let that poor thing lay there in that hot sun all day long like that and that poor little baby is nursing that old milk from her like that and die a death like that? I said, "Sister Woods, I I know you're right, but I just can't do it." So all day it was pretty heavy and around the house, the people coming and that night Mr. Woods come up said, "Now look, Billy, you got to go out and take a little rest." So he and his wife, me and my wife, we talked a little ride and uh we come from there and run over a little old dog and I had him to stop and I went back and picked it up mangy and fleas and lice all over him. And my wife said, "I guess you're going to keep it." I said, "Yes, ma'am." Oh, she said, "Kill that dog, honey." Said, "The thing it's dying anyhow." I said, "I'm going to pray for him." I said, "He's little. He ought to live. Ain't nothing wrong with him." So he's a great big fine collie now. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, you know, God does that. &gt;&gt; Sure does. &gt;&gt; So, then we find out when we went in that night about 11:00, I throw the lights there. Lady the old mother pawsum stretched out. Brother Wood said, "Well, now brother Brandon, you've hunted enough to know and hunted possums enough to know when the sun went down. If is any that possum is ever going to raise, it would raise." And you know that too, you people. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. He's in the house. Oh, he's in the house.

Just keep our brother in prayer and just enter in. Pull from the gift of God tonight. Let us speak to your heart. Let's start with that first. Try to start with that first verse. Well, when I look all around and see all the good things God has done for me. Amen. Can you sing it tonight? But his blessings be him. I've got so much to thank you for singing out. I got so much to thank you for so much. You see, you know, so to me now he's done. He has brought me from my soul to thank you. Yeah, sometimes while on my way I need I just stop and say thank you for all you done for me. Someday I'll reach heaven shore. Oh please, just let me kneel once more. I've got so much. Amen. Is that the way you feel tonight? Sing it to him now. Praise him for all you see. He has been so good to me. And when I think of what he's done and where he has brought me from, I've got so much to thank him for. Give him a hand of praise tonight if you love him. How he's happy to be in the house of the Lord this evening. Amen. And if you have your Bibles, we'll go right into the word tonight. How many enjoyed this the message this morning? Wasn't that wonderful? Amen. We just thank the Lord for what he's done for us and and thank the Lord for revival tonight. If uh if you would turn in your Bibles to Exodus chapter 13, Exodus chapter 13, and we'll start with verse 17. Chap Exodus 13 and verse 17. And we'll read through the 22nd verse before you're seated. Exodus 13 and1 17. If you get it, say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. If I had a title tonight, it would be revival in an Exodus. Revival in an Exodus. And verse 17 says it like this. And it came to pass when Pharaoh had let the people go that God led them not through the way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near. For God said, "Lest per adventure the people repent when they see war and they return to Egypt." But God led the people about through the way of the wilderness of the Red Sea. And the children of Israel went up harnessed out of the land of Egypt. And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him, for he had straightly sworn the children of Israel, saying, "God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you." And they took their journey from Sukhoth and encamped in Etham in the edge of the wilderness. Verse 21 says, "And the Lord went before them by day and a pillar of cloud to lead them in the way and by night and a pillar of fire to give them light to go by day and night. And he took not away the pillar of the cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night from before the people." And you may be seated. And we'll go read uh one more here. And it is uh Exodus just right here. We'll go over to Exodus chapter 14, next chapter there. And we I'd like to read verse 10 through 15 there. Exodus 14 and verse 10-15. And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and behold, the Egyptians marched after them, and they were sore afraid. And the children of Israel cried unto the Lord, and they said unto Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt, thou hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? Wherefore hast thou dealt hast thou dealt thus with us to carry us forth out of Egypt? Is not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians, for it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians than that we should die in the wilderness. And Moses said unto the people, "Fear ye not. Stand still, and see the salvation of the Lord, which he will show to you today. For the Egyptians whom ye have seen today, ye shall see them again no more forever. The Lord shall fight for you. Somebody say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; "And ye shall hold your peace." And the Lord said unto Moses, "Wherefore cry thou unto me, speak unto the children of Israel that they go forward." And tonight, while I was thinking on this thought here over the last few days and some of the messages I was listening to, I was thinking about they had there was a revival in the time of an Exodus. There was a revival in the time when they were in the desert. There was a revival. Amen. They had to have something uh that would take them out, but also something to sustain them in the time when it would get dry. Can you say amen? Because they would come uh from Egypt where they were able to eat. They were, you know, they had there was a certain security to where they were there in Egypt. Even though they were they were slaves, they were uh they were they were allowed to eat. They were allowed to have homes. They were allowed to to live. And they it was in a routine. They had a good routine. They had a had things they could do. And they they actually got to a point where following God was harder in their minds than serving the Egyptians. &gt;&gt; And I wonder today if we don't get the same way. We think, well, it's just too hard to be a Christian. It's just too hard to It's too hard to live the life that God has called us to live. Amen. But I want you to notice that it says, "Fear not. Stand still and see the salvation of the Lord." Amen. See the salvation. see his saving power. See what he's got for you. And so, you know, when Moses was there when he called him from Israel, brother Brandon would talk about uh Moses being spiritual and he said he understood that God was going to take the children of Israel out and he called him to do it. But now he tried to do it in himself and he said that's what's the matter with a lot of people today. You try to bring healing to yourself. You try to work up your own salvation and he said that won't work. It just won't do it. joining churches and signing papers and putting pledges in. That's not God's program. That's just religion. But that's not salvation. Notice he said he failed miserably. Failed. And he said uh he said here he run in the desert for 40 years while God had him back on the back side of the desert where he married this Ethiopian woman Zapor. And she was a highteer. He said she was a hightempered. Moses was too. So I guess there was a little little trouble on the back side of the desert. And he said, you know, he said, ' Don't turn your wife down cuz she's got a little temper. Maybe that maybe that's your cross. God might have give it to you to kind of keep you lined up. And he said, "Amen." Well, somebody say, "Praise the Lord." &gt;&gt; And he but he said, "Now, we'll balance that to my wife that's giving me a look right now." He said, he said, "Maybe that's your cross." And he said, "Same thing with you women to your husbands. Stick together. Uh God promised to God promised you." He said, uh to stay with it. notice. He said, "I'm a person don't believe in marriage and divorce." And he said, "You know that my brother," he said, "if you went," he said, "if you went at it more prayerfully, there'd be less of it." That's free for you young people. &gt;&gt; If you went at it more prayerfully, there'd be less of it. &gt;&gt; Are you still with me? So, Moses is in a place. He's on the back side of the desert. Can you give me some more monitors up here, please? He said, "If you give," he said, uh, he said, "If you just got here on the back side of the desert, Moses was in a place where he thought everything was he could have delivered the people on his own." You know, at one point he was going to be ruler of Egypt. He could have just taken the people. Amen. He could have taken them just by by natur by physical force. He could have uh Thank you. He said he he could he was standing there maybe in Egypt one day as a as the next in line to Pharaoh and the next thing you know maybe Moses could have stood there and and and and and he could have said, "Well, when I'm Pharaoh," he could have waited 40 years. He could have become Pharaoh and delivered the people of God, but there would have been no supernatural to it. There would have been no God in it. It would have all been Moses. And Moses would have got the glory. Are you still with me tonight? Amen. But they had to go through a trial in order for God to show his power. Stand still and see the salvation. Are you with me tonight? Amen. Because so if you try to save yourself or if you try to heal yourself, you try to work yourself into something, I want you to notice that God is not in that. But God is in the trial. &gt;&gt; GOD IS IN THE DESERT. GOD WAS in the rock. Water. When water came forth from the rock, I want you to notice something. He didn't have to smite that rock. What he had to do was speak to the rock. Speak to your situation and he will bring forth the water. I want you to notice tonight Moses many times when he got it himself, that's where Moses would mess up. &gt;&gt; Come on, sir. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, Moses didn't mess up. He was God's man for the hour. He was a man that made mistakes. He was a man that God chose, but he was still a man." Can you say amen? He was a man that would stand on the back side of the desert. Maybe if you could have seen the home life of Moses, you would have never followed him. &gt;&gt; He was married to a hightempered woman and he was a hightempered man. And maybe if you could have seen how they lived in their home, you would have never followed the man. &gt;&gt; But God hid him from the public. God put him there for a reason on the back side of the desert. But what was it? Moses had to have a revival on the back side of the desert. MOSES HAD TO MEET GOD before he could ever become the deliverer. Are you still WITH ME NOW? MOSES IN HIS CONDITION AS A MAN THAT WAS SITTING OUT THERE BACKSLIDING on the back side OF THE DESERT COULD HAVE NEVER DELIVERED THE PEOPLE. BUT HE HAD TO MEET GOD IN ORDER TO deliver the people. And so when he met God, I WANT YOU TO notice something. It revived something on the inside of Moses. Moses the deliverer was always called to be the deliverer, but he had forgotten what God HAD CALLED HIM TO DO. NOW, no doubt he was a shepherd now. He was on the back side of the desert. He was a family man. He decided maybe this is what God's GOT FOR ME. BUT ONE DAY WHEN HE MET GOD again on the back side of the desert, he remembered THAT GOD HAS GOT something for me to do. And what he had for MOSES TO DO WAS NOT TO just be a shepherd, was not to just be a husband, but was not to just be on the back side of THE DESERT, BUT HE CALLED MOSES TO BE the deliverer. And Moses needed to remember who he was. So there had to come a revival. &gt;&gt; I want to tell you something tonight. Some of y'all, you know, we're in the message of the hour and we start lifting Brother Brandham up and saying he never had to have a revival. Brother Brandham said he had to have revival. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Are you still with me? WE MAKE A PROPHET SAY, "WELL, HE NEVER HE NEVER HAD BAD DAYS. HE NEVER HE NEVER GOT DOWN. He never had TO HAVE A REFILLING." BROTHER BRANDHAM had to have a filling of the Holy Ghost to begin with, and he had to have refillings. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He would get down. He would get blue. He would get I tell you what, people that have elevated him to deity and made him Jesus Christ. What you've do what you've done according to the prophet himself, you've made him Antichrist. I'M NOT HERE TO POINT YOU TO A MAN. I'M HERE TO POINT YOU TO A MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; If the people would have followed Moses, they wouldn't have had nobody TO FOLLOW. MOSES WAS following the pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon was was following a pillar of fire. The same one that Moses was following. He wasn't following. He wasn't telling the people, "Look at me. Look at me. Do what I do." Although there was a time in life he could say that. &gt;&gt; There was a time in life he could say, "I've tried to live right before you. I've I've tried to do what I've preached." And I believe every preacher should. Amen. But if you're looking at the flesh of a man, I want you to notice that there might be a highteered man that God called. &gt;&gt; There might be a man that's made some mistakes that God's called. There might be a man that's that's that's done some things that that you wouldn't approve of that God has called and chosen to be your leader. &gt;&gt; Are you still with me now? &gt;&gt; Brother Ray would say it like this. He said now he was he was a sheep herder for his father-in-law way back on the back side of the desert. God always gives something. Uh one day he was walking along while he was a shepherd and he looked over and he seen a burning bush and God always gives something to attract the attention of the believer. So he stepped aside not to criticize, not to analyze, not to pull some of the leaves off and take it down to the laboratory to see why them leaves didn't burn. He stepped to the side of this burning fire. He said reverently he approached it and God said take off your shoes Moses for the ground you stand on is holy ground and that's what it is today. The reason the gifts in the church and the reason the people don't get very much today is because it's it's an irreverent approach. &gt;&gt; Are you still with me now? &gt;&gt; And he said it like this. He said he said they come in and he said they've got a madeup mind. And when you come to God don't just half-hazardly come and beat on the altar and chew the chew chewing gum. That's not the way to come to God. just come as sane and as you can come and mean what you're talking about. God will receive you. Are you with me? And he said, Moses Mo Moses said, "I've seen the suffering of my people. I've remembered my promise." And he said, "I love that God always remembers every promise that he made. I'm going to send you right back down to Egypt." And Moses began to complain. &gt;&gt; Think about it. God's man &gt;&gt; standing there looking at the burning bush. And Moses began to complain. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Can somebody say &gt;&gt; amen? &gt;&gt; Are you with me tonight? Think about what he was in. Moses was in a time where he needed revival. Moses needed a re Are you with me? Is this right OR WRONG? MOSES NEEDED REVIVAL. MOSES WAS CALLED. MOSES WAS GOD'S MAN. BUT HE GOT ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE DESERT. IT WAS DRY. He needed revival. HAVE YOU EVER FOUND YOURSELF IN A PLACE WHERE YOU NEEDED REVIVAL? HAVE YOU EVER FOUND YOURSELF IN THE DESERT WHERE YOU NEEDED REVIVAL? MAYBE YOU WERE DOING YOUR JOB. Maybe you WERE YOU WERE TENDING THE SHEEP. MAYBE YOU WERE DOING EVERYTHING YOU NEEDED TO DO, BUT YOU STILL NEEDED REVIVAL. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. MOSES WAS NOT LOST. MOSES GOD DIDN'T TAKE SOMEBODY ELSE AND SAY, "MOSES IS NOT GOING to do the JOB BECAUSE HE'S BACKSLIDING." NO. Moses was what was on THE BACK SIDE OF THE DESERT. MOSES NEEDED REVIVAL, BUT HE WAS STILL GOD'S MAN. IF YOU FOUND YOURSELF IN NEED OF REVIVAL, THAT DON'T MEAN YOU'RE NOT SAVED. THAT DON'T MEAN YOU'RE NOT ANOINTED TO RUN THIS RACE, THAT DON'T MEAN YOU'RE NOT THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST, BUT YOU NEED A REVIVAL. &gt;&gt; Are you with me today? I would say today, if the WORD IS NOT STIRRING YOUR HEART, YOU NEED a revival. I would also say today, IF YOU CAN SIT AND THE WORD WILL FALL ON YOUR EARS LIKE DEAF EARS, YOU NEED A REVIVAL. IF IT'S HARD TO SAY, AMEN IN CHURCH, YOU NEED A REVIVAL. IF IT'S HARD TO CLAIM YOUR HEALING, YOU NEED A REVIVAL. &gt;&gt; If it's hard for the YOUNG PEOPLE TO LIVE A CHRISTIAN LIFE, YOU NEED A REVIVAL. IF IT'S, COME ON, CHURCH. IF IT'S GETTING HARD TO GET UP IN THE MORNING AND READ YOUR BIBLE, YOU NEED A REVIVAL. IF IT'S GETTING HARD TO TURN ON THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR, &gt;&gt; COME ON. &gt;&gt; YOU NEED a revival. &gt;&gt; Are you still with me today? &gt;&gt; Anybody else NEED A REVIVAL BESIDES me in the building tonight? &gt;&gt; Anybody else need revival here tonight? I TELL YOU, INSTEAD OF WANTING REVIVAL FOR SOMEBODY ELSE, I NEED A REVIVAL. INSTEAD OF YOU POINTING AROUND THE CHURCH, WE NEED AN INDIVIDUAL REVIVAL. And it'll IT'LL MAKE YOU QUIT CRITICIZING EVERYBODY ELSE. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. IF YOU FIND YOURSELF CRITICIZING, WHAT DO YOU NEED? &gt;&gt; IF YOU FIND YOURSELF DEAD AND COLD IN THE HOUSE OF GOD, WHAT DO YOU NEED? &gt;&gt; If you find yourself WHEN THE WHEN THE SONGS ARE GOING FORTH AND YOU FEEL THE PRESENCE OF GOD AND YOU SIT THERE AND YOU CAN'T RAISE YOUR HAND, WHAT DO YOU NEED? A revival. Come on, CHURCH. I TELL YOU WHAT WE NEED TONIGHT IS A GOOD OLD STERN IN THE HOUSE OF GOD. WHAT WE NEED TONIGHT IS TO QUIT SITTING THERE LIKE AS DEAD AS 12:00 AND REMEMBER WHO WE ARE. CAN WE REMEMBER WHAT GOD HAS CALLED US TO? WE NEED A REVIVAL. &gt;&gt; We know that the word is a revival today. We understand that the opening of the word and and all these things are are the awakening of the bride. We understand that. I believe everyone in the building here tonight has been awakened to the word of your hour. I do believe that you are in an eternal revival. I believe that there's a revival without end. this message. That's what that's what it is. It is a word revival. BUT DURING THE TIME, even when THE PEOPLE WERE FOLLOWING MOSES, THEY STILL NEEDED TIMES OF REFRESHING, which we call revival today. Amen. It was times of revival. They they needed something to eat. What did God do? He sent mana to feed the people. THAT WAS REVIVAL. WHEN THEY NEEDED WATER, THERE WAS A PROPHET in the land who could who could speak to the rock and bring forth water. What did the people need? THEY NEEDED WATER. GOD PROVIDED WATER. IF YOU NEED A REVIVAL TONIGHT, GOD WILL SEND YOU A REVIVAL. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; AMEN. But what we've done today is we've become just like Moses was standing there at the burning bush. He started complaining. I'm not good enough. I'm not strong enough. &gt;&gt; There's not enough people with me. Well, come on, somebody. Not enough people going TO SHOUT WITH ME. NOT ENOUGH PEOPLE GOING TO RAISE THEIR HANDS WITH ME. It's just me in the church THAT'S SITTING THERE WORSHIPING GOD. NOBODY ELSE WILL JOIN ME IN REVIVAL. SO, I I just can't worship myself. The next thing you know, you become cold and dead and indifferent &gt;&gt; and start picking at people. And really, while you're waiting on everybody else to come into revival, you need a revival. &gt;&gt; It's me, oh Lord, stand in the need of prayer. Who needs a revival more than me? I need revival. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; I would say for our young people, it's time that they experience revival. It's time THAT THEY DON'T WATCH THE ELDERS of the church sit there and they won't raise their hands no more. The cry of joy was gone. &gt;&gt; Do you realize that the Ephesian church, how they knew they were dead and cold was the cry of joy was gone? I come on church WORD OF LIFE. CAN WE just not We don't need to lose the cry of joy. But I say we need the joy BACK IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD. The pastor said it this this MORNING AND AND THE BIBLE TELLS US IT'S NOT THAT YOU'VE LOST YOUR SALVATION, BUT IF YOU'VE LOST THE JOY OF YOUR SALVATION, IT'S TIME WE'RE LIKE DAVID AND SAY, "LORD, RESTORE UNTO ME THE JOY OF MY SALVATION." IF THE CRY OF JOY IS GONE, YOU NEED A REVIVAL. &gt;&gt; Brother Joel, why you yelling at us today? I I TELL YOU WHAT, IT'S TIME WE WAKE UP. IT'S TIME WE RECOGNIZE WHAT WE need in the HOUSE OF GOD. IT'S TIME WE QUIT TRYING TO CRY AND START SPEAKING THAT WE'RE IN REVIVAL. IT'S TIME WE QUIT CRYING ABOUT IT. WELL, I CAN'T GET MY HEALING WHEN HEALING'S ALREADY BEEN PROVIDED. WELL, I'M GOING TO CRY ABOUT MY CHILDREN NOT SAVED WHEN ALL YOU NEED TO BE DOING IS speak for your children. HE SAID, "WHY CRY, MOSES? SPEAK THE WORD AND GO FORWARD." &gt;&gt; WHY CRY ABOUT IT? SPEAK THE WORD. ARE WE IN THE SPOKEN WORD AGE OR ARE WE NOT? &gt;&gt; MOSES DIDN'T KNOW HALF OF WHAT YOU KNOW. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Think about it. &gt;&gt; God's man for the hour did not understand the word that you understand. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Think about it. You say, "Well, everything was revealed to him." No, Moses didn't need to know what you know. &gt;&gt; MOSES DIDN'T HAVE MO MOSES FOUGHT DIFFERENT DEVIL. HE SAID FOUGHT the same devil, but he fought demons THAT WERE THAT THAT WOULD GET HIM. They he would maybe he was even complacent on the back side of the desert. Maybe he found a spirit of complacency. Now, that spirit's very much alive today. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; It's very much alive today. I'll tell you what we've got today is we've got people I and brother Brandon will get pretty plain on some of these messages I've been listening to. We've got a spirit that is a leodyian spirit. It's it it'll lull you to sleep. It is a spirit that is actually a lazy spirit. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm not calling people lazy. It's a spirit of laziness that gets on the people. YOU'RE TOO LAZY TO WORSHIP GOD. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Are we still here? Are we Are we together? &gt;&gt; WE GET TOO LAZY TO WORSHIP GOD. WE GET TOO LAZY. COME ON, CHURCH. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE BEING LAZY. I'M TALKING ABOUT WHEN YOU COME TO THE HOUSE OF GOD AND YOU DRAG IN AND you don't want you don't want to BE THERE. WHY? IT'S A SPIRIT OF LAZINESS THAT HAS COME ON THE PEOPLE. I DON'T WANT TO WORSHIP. IT'S A LAZY SPIRIT. &gt;&gt; Come on. Preach. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Well, I tell you what, &gt;&gt; I'll get run out of here and &gt;&gt; I'll be gone next week and won't see you for two weeks. So, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; This is one of those where I can preach and leave and you'll love me when I come back because you'll forget about it. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said he may. He said, "I'm going to send you right back down." And Moses began to complain, but he said, "Show me your glory." And God showed Moses his glory. And then he was ready to go. I wonder if we just need to see the glory of God today so we can get back in this army. &gt;&gt; We need to get in the army in due time. It's time we get back on track. Come on, church. You know, we start talking about a rapture and we've decided that it's just not going to happen right now. &gt;&gt; Oh my. COME ON. &gt;&gt; WE'VE DECIDED in our own minds that the rapture really ain't going to happen tomorrow. Because if it did, there'd be more people in the house of God tonight. &gt;&gt; If you really thought the rapture could happen in the morning, would you miss church on? &gt;&gt; Think about it. &gt;&gt; If you thought in your heart &gt;&gt; that the rapture was going to take place on Monday morning. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; Would you miss church on Sunday night? &gt;&gt; No, you wouldn't. &gt;&gt; You see what the spirit is? It's it's it's not that we're bad people. It's that we've let the world uh we've let we've let our eyes get filmed over. And brother Brandham called that he said we need eyes. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? He said John's eagle eye got filmed over. It it could happen to Moses. It could happen to John. It could happen to our prophet. &gt;&gt; Every one of us can get in a place where we we feel like we need revival, but the but are we really hungering for revival? Do we really want the effects of revival? If if something got a hold of US AND WE SHOUTED IN THE HOUSE OF GOD, WOULDN'T we be okay with that? Would it BE OKAY IF WE NEVER CLAPPED our hands, BUT ALL OF A SUDDEN SOMETHING COMING OVER US AND WE CLAPPED OUR HANDS IN THE HOUSE OF GOD? COME ON, CHURCH. I'M NOT TALKING THAT'S NOT REVIVAL, BUT IT'S THE EFFECTS OF REVIVAL. IF YOU NEVER SAID AMEN IN CHURCH AND ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU LET OUT A BIG OLD AMEN, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, THAT MIGHT BE SOMETHING ON THE INSIDE OF YOU THAT IS AN EFFECT OF REVIVAL. &gt;&gt; WHAT WE NEED IS THE EFFECTS OF REVIVAL BECAUSE OUR YOUNG COME ON CHURCH. I tell you what we need today IS WE NEED TO QUIT SITTING THERE and saying, "Well, I've got enough religion to make it." And I tell you what, WE GET IN THAT CONDITION AND WE'RE RUINING a whole generation of young people. &gt;&gt; It's what we're doing. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You say, "What are you preaching tonight?" I'm preaching what's on MY HEART TONIGHT. I NEED A REVIVAL. I told Brother Ben this morning, I saw his sermon title. I said, "You stole everything I wanted to say." Because we need revival. WE'RE WAITING ON SOMETHING TO HAPPEN. WE'RE WAITING ON A MOVE TO HAVE REVIVAL. WE DON'T NEED TO WAIT ON A MOVE TO HAVE REVIVAL. WE NEED REVIVAL RIGHT NOW. &gt;&gt; We need revival in the HOUSE OF GOD. CHURCH, I TELL YOU WHAT, EVERY SERVICE WE COME HERE AND WE MAIL IT IN. &gt;&gt; Do you realize we've got young people that could have been saved in that service? &gt;&gt; DO YOU REALIZE THAT THAT SERVICE COULD HAVE BEEN A HOLY GHOST FILLED SERVICE FOR OUR YOUNG PEOPLE? &gt;&gt; DO YOU REALIZE SOMEBODY MIGHT HAVE NEEDED A BREAKTHROUGH IN THAT SERVICE, BUT WE SAT THERE WITH A CRITICAL SPIRIT? IF YOU'RE THE ONE THAT'S GOT THAT TONIGHT, YOU NEED A REVIVAL. &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Joel, I I'm saved. I'm filled WITH THE HOLY GHOST. YOU MAY BE AND YOU MAY STILL NEED REVIVAL. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, MANY OF THE ONES, WE'LL just say it like this just for we'll just dramatize it a little bit. They come out of Egypt. &gt;&gt; They're following a vindicated prophet. Everything's perfect. No reason to need revival no more. No reason to even go to church no more. We're following a prophet. &gt;&gt; There's no reason for nothing because we got a vindicated prophet in front of us. Next thing you know, they get out there. No doubt they're singing and rejoicing and dancing and we got out of Egypt. &gt;&gt; Look at us. &gt;&gt; We made it. &gt;&gt; We're following Moses. Moses did it. We're good. They get to the Red Sea AND THEN THEY HEAR MO THEY HEAR PHARAOH'S army coming &gt;&gt; and ALL OF A SUDDEN FEAR SETS IN &gt;&gt; AND THEY FORGET WHAT THEY'RE FOLLOWING. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; FEAR SETS IN AT THE RED SEA AND THEY THEY LOOK BACK AND THEY GET SCARED. WHY? BECAUSE THE FIRST mistake was looking back. &gt;&gt; That's right. They look back where we came from. Well, if we're going to die here at THE RED SEA, WE might as well stay right back in Egypt. &gt;&gt; See, comfort. &gt;&gt; Lazy. &gt;&gt; It's a spirit that gets on people. &gt;&gt; I'm not trying to be hard to you tonight. Maybe I'm preaching just at myself. &gt;&gt; And if I am, go ahead and amen and pitchfork on me. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; I'm okay with it because I need it. &gt;&gt; The pastor needs it. &gt;&gt; The deacons need it. The trustees need it. Come on. &gt;&gt; Our young people need it. And I got news for you. Every one of you need it. &gt;&gt; EVERY ONE OF US need it. WE NEED REVIVAL. &gt;&gt; BUT ARE WE SCARED OF THE EFFECTS of it? &gt;&gt; Think about it. So they get down to the Red Sea and the next thing you know, they look around and boy, they're scared to death. You imagine two million people, women and children and all the animals. And you think about, man, it's just chaos. They're delivered. &gt;&gt; And now they're about to all die. They think &gt;&gt; they forgot who delivered them. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; They forgot the same God that brought them out of Egypt was the same God that was going to see them all the way through. But they forgot and they would instead OF GOING TO THE PROMISED LAND THAT THEY KNEW ABOUT, &gt;&gt; they wanted to go back. &gt;&gt; And Moses stealed the people. &gt;&gt; And Moses when he stealed the people, no doubt Moses himself thought, I wonder what's going to happen now. And the Lord had to come and speak to Moses. Stretch forth your rod. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And I want you to notice that when they went through the trial, &gt;&gt; and every one of Pharaoh's army was dead in the sea. &gt;&gt; Every one of them. The sea covered them, drowned them all. They get to the other side. Now, think about this. They get to the other side and there's revival again. They're dancing and shouting and rejoicing. But you know what it was? They finally got through the trial. But you know, instead of being scared on the other side, if they'd have ever looked to who they were following, they could have been rejoicing on the other side of the Red Sea, too. &gt;&gt; Because they could Come on. Are you with me now? DO YOU REALIZE THAT EVERY TRIAL YOU'RE GETTING READY TO GO THROUGH, YOU MIGHT AS WELL GO AHEAD AND GET READY TO REJOICE BECAUSE GOD'S GOING TO BRING YOU THROUGH EVERY ONE of them. &gt;&gt; I WILL BE WITH YOU, even in you. ARE YOU STILL WITH ME NOW? I'M IN THE MIDST OF A TRIAL. REJOICE IN THE MIDST OF YOUR TRIAL. I I'M GETTING READY TO GO THROUGH A TRIAL. THEN START LOOKING TO THE ONE THAT'S LEADING AND QUIT LOOKING TO THE ONE THAT'S BEHIND YOU. &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. EVERY ONE OF YOUR ENEMIES IS ALREADY AS GOOD AS DEAD. &gt;&gt; EVERY ONE OF THEM. WHAT WE'VE DONE IS WE'VE DECIDED TO LET THE DEVIL SCARE US REAL GOOD. BUT IF YOU'LL FOLLOW A VINDICATED WORD, &gt;&gt; THEN GOD'S ALREADY GOT YOU. ARE YOU STILL WITH ME NOW, CHURCH? YOU KNOW, WE START CRYING OVER OUR JOB SITUATION. WE START CRYING OVER YOUR MARRIAGE SITUATION. YOU START CRYING OVER YOUR BACKSLITTING CHILDREN. And I understand that as humans, WE HAVE A CERTAIN part of us that gets anxious AND WEARY AND WE GET DOWN and we feel bad and we GO THROUGH BAD DAYS. BUT I WANT YOU TO REMEMBER HERE ON THIS Sunday afternoon that greater is he that is in you than the ONE THAT TOOK YOUR KIDS. GREATER IS THE ONE THAT'S IN YOU. AMEN. THAN THE DEVIL THAT'S SITTING THERE GETTING READY TO DROWN YOU. COME ON CHURCH. Do you realize those chariots THAT ARE COMING AND THE DEVILS THAT ARE COMING AFTER YOU? GOD SET THEIR EVERYONE DEAD. IF HE DID IT FOR THEM, HE COULD DO IT FOR YOU. IF HE DID IT FOR ME, HE COULD DO IT for you. &gt;&gt; If he Listen, church, I tell you what, IT WAS THE HAND OF GOD THROUGH MY WHOLE LIFE. EVERYTHING I DID FROM THE TIME I WAS A YOUNG MAN ALL THE WAY TILL I GOT MARRIED, I PROMISED YOU I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING RIGHT. BUT GOD, RICH IN MERCY. BUT GOD SAW FIT TO GO AHEAD AND GIVE ME A WIFE. COME ON, CHURCH. I TELL YOU TONIGHT, WHAT WE NEED IS QUIT LOOKING AT THE CIRCUMSTANCES. QUIT LOOKING AT THE ARMY THAT'S CHASING US AND START REMEMBERING WHO THE GOD THAT BROUGHT US OUT OF THIS MESS WAS. IF HE BROUGHT YOU THIS FAR, HE'S GOING TO TAKE YOU TO THE PROMISED LAND. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; DO YOU SEE WHO WE ARE TODAY? WE'RE JUST LIKE THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. &gt;&gt; We're just like they were. &gt;&gt; Quit worrying. &gt;&gt; COME ON. &gt;&gt; QUIT LOOKING BACK AND START LOOKING FORWARD. &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "WELL, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT I went through AS A YOUNG PERSON. MAYBE MY KIDS WILL DO THE SAME THING I DID." THEY DON'T HAVE TO GO WHAT YOU through what you went through. Preach. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Well, I backslid. I turned my back on God. That doesn't mean your children have to. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And if your children DID, YOU NEED TO BE HOLDING ON TO A PROMISE AND QUIT LOOKING AT THE CIRCUMSTANCES. &gt;&gt; WELL, come on, somebody. YOU OUGHT TO PREACH WITH ME TONIGHT. WE'VE GOT TOO MUCH FEAR AND SCARE AMONG the people. And Moses HAD TO COME AND STEAL THE PEOPLE. WE HAVE A WORD TODAY THAT WILL STEAL the people. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; It'll say, "Quit worrying. Don't be fearful. Don't be anxious about nothing." AMEN. WOULD GIVE GOD THANKS ALWAYS. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; If you give God thanks in THE MIDST OF THE TRIAL AND YOU KNOW HE'S ALREADY, YOU KNOW WHY YOU THANK HIM IN THE MIDST of the trial is because you know you're coming through the trial. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; IF YOU GIVE GOD THANKS, COME ON. YOU KNOW, WE WAIT TILL THE TRIAL IS OVER AND SO DID SO DID MIRIAM. Moses even got through there. Moses got to the other side. Miriam got to the other side and they were dancing and shouting. Moses or Miriam was beating the tambourine and Moses was singing. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; They're on the other side now, right? and they're having a good time and you know all the fear and all the scare was gone. LOOK WHAT GOD DID. AND THE next thing you know, listen to me. &gt;&gt; The next thing you know, they're in the middle of a wilderness and God led them the long way. Read your Bible on it. &gt;&gt; God decided to take them on the longest path. Brother said they could have got there and I forget how many days it was, just a few days. &gt;&gt; Three days they could have got to where they were going, but God took them 40 years. &gt;&gt; Come on. Because God knew these people needed to go through a trial. &gt;&gt; God needed to get these people to trust. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; God decided to lead them. They were following the pillar of fire. But the next thing you know, so they see the the miracles and the signs in Egypt and they're following a vindicated prophet to the Red Sea. God shows up and drowns the entire army. They're rejoicing and happy. And then they're hungry. God gives them angel food &gt;&gt; and they complain about that too because it's getting old. &gt;&gt; We don't want that. &gt;&gt; We don't want just the word &gt;&gt; because it's getting a little stale. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And they're complainers. &gt;&gt; Are you still with me? &gt;&gt; It's a little boring in the house of God today. &gt;&gt; We don't even want to show up. &gt;&gt; Some of them decided they weren't even going to come out the tent. &gt;&gt; My wife and I fought just like the prophet did last night. We're not coming out. We don't care what God did. We decided, you know, we might as well we just been we'd been better off in Egypt because at least we ate every day &gt;&gt; and here they are free. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; They've got they've got food that is literally coming down from heaven. Imagine walking out of your house Monday morning &gt;&gt; and you paid your tithe and that was the last bit of money you had and Chick-fil-A was sitting on your doorstep. &gt;&gt; You don't like Chick-fil-A? Shame on you. I tell you what, think about it. God was feeding them angel food every new every morning. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; EVERY MORNING. ALL THEY COULD EAT. &gt;&gt; THEY GO IN AND GATHER up angel's food. Sister Alice, ANGEL'S FOOD. GOD is raining it from the sky. THEY DON'T HAVE A FOOD BILL. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; No grocery shopping, no Walmart experiences. &gt;&gt; They've got a vindicated prophet. They've seen signs and miracles. They've seen more than any of you have seen in this building today. &gt;&gt; I don't think there was anybody here that actually physically saw the the works when Brother Brandon was alive. I don't think there is. But I'll tell you this, maybe there is. If there is, forgive me. But if you saw it, that's wonderful. But I'll say this, most of us haven't seen that. Most of us haven't seen those works done. They saw Pharaoh's army drown. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; They saw the plagues come down on Egypt and the deliverance happen. They saw all these things and they still found time to complain. &gt;&gt; Yeah, they did &gt;&gt; because maybe their best friend didn't text them that day. &gt;&gt; And maybe, &gt;&gt; come on. &gt;&gt; I'M JUST I'M JUST TALKING ABOUT real life problems here. You know, Satan will tell you that somebody don't like you. And really what it is, it's just Satan working and trying to get between you. What you need to do is realize we've all got problems. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; We've all got We've all got opinions. We've all got Listen, church, you realize, you know, Brother Ben, I'll pick on him. Brother Ben was an awkward little kid. Little kid. He was. And And you know, I even went through I went through that awkward state. Really awkward stage. Nobody wanted to be around me, including him. &gt;&gt; And And you know, you get through that, you get through a time in life, you get through the awkward stage in the teenage years, then you grow up. And the next thing you know, you're too busy. And so, you want to have it's like there there's all the time I'm telling my wife, we're going to go, we're going to go, we're going to invite people over to the house. We're going to invite people over to the house. We're going to do this. We're going to do that. Six months later, we haven't done it. &gt;&gt; Brother Joel, you just don't love us. Well, the truth is my intentions are good. But next thing you know, I I'm I'm either gone or I'm here or you know what it is. It it sometimes. And then people get offended. I get offended too. &gt;&gt; Preachers ain't supposed to. Well, everybody gets offended. You know, you hear you hear one day of, well, what wish you could lead songs, you know, I could do a better job than that or something like that, you know, and you're like, man, kick me while I'm down. Why don't you you know what I mean? We're all human. We all have feelings. We do. Anybody else here got no humans in the building? All these angels sitting here. It's easy to preach to angels, &gt;&gt; but they don't know what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; But you get in these situations. This is the children of Israel. Do you realize Moses dealt with people just like you? Oh Lord help us is right. &gt;&gt; Uh Moses dealt with people just like you. Every one of us has complained about something we should have compl shouldn't have complained about. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Walk in the fellowship hall one day and the potluck and and and we don't like what's there and we could change that by bringing what we like. You know, &gt;&gt; man, there wasn't no pumpkin pie at the at the at the Thanksgiving dinner. Well, you didn't bring one. Will you? Anybody else here? &gt;&gt; What I'm saying is we find ourselves complaining about things that we don't need to be complaining about. &gt;&gt; Have you ever thought about what God's done for you? &gt;&gt; Oh, yes. &gt;&gt; We complain, but if you ever look around, Brother David brought me out on that song. You ever look around and see all the blessings that he's given you? &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Anybody here got a child that's with them today in the building? &gt;&gt; If you got a child here, you're blessed. If you got a spouse here, you're blessed. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. If you're sitting in the house OF GOD TODAY, YOU'RE BLESSED TO be here. &gt;&gt; DO YOU REALIZE WHO WE ARE? WE'RE A BLESSED PEOPLE. LIFE HAPPENS. LOTS OF THINGS ARE GOING TO GO WRONG. THERE'S GOING TO BE A PLENTY OF THINGS TO COMPLAIN ABOUT. BUT WHY DON'T WE QUIT COMPLAINING AND START THANKING GOD FOR WHAT HE'S DONE? LORD, YOU BROUGHT ME FROM A MIGHTY LONG WAY. LORD, YOU PICK ME UP THIS MORNING. YOU WOKE ME UP. THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH TO THANK YOU FOR IT. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; YES, I MIGHT BE DEALING WITH ALL KINDS OF PAIN. YES, I MIGHT HAVE SICKNESS IN MY BODY, BUT I KNOW A HEALER, AND I THANK GOD FOR THAT. YES, I MIGHT HAVE DONE SOME STUPID THINGS IN MY LIFE, BUT THANK GOD FOR A HEALING VESSEL AND A HEALING FOUNTAIN. THANK GOD FOR WATER FROM THE ROM. THANK GOD FOR A MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. THANK GOD FOR A MESSAGE THAT WOULD COME BY A KENTUCKY HILLBILLY WHO GAVE HIS LIFE TO TO GET THIS MESSAGE TO THE PEOPLE. COME ON, CHURCH. &gt;&gt; HE POINTED US TO JESUS CHRIST THAT'S LIVING TODAY. DO YOU REALIZE WHAT WE ARE? WE'RE a blessed people. &gt;&gt; Come on. BUT WE'VE LOOKED BACK TO EGYPT TOO MANY TIMES. WE NEED TO START LOOKING AT THE PROMISES COMING. YES, THERE'S GOING TO BE PROBLEMS. YES, THERE'S GOING TO BE DRY SPELLS. YES, THERE'S GOING TO BE THINGS HAPPEN. BUT THE COMPLAINERS ARE NOT THE ONES GOING TO MAKE IT ALL THE WAY. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; You know what we do? We start complaining and the next thing you know, God wants to come down. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Swallow us all up. &gt;&gt; He getting tired of hearing it. Didn't I bring you out of drugs? Didn't I bring Didn't I Didn't I cure that habit of smoking? Didn't I Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; Didn't I bring you out of the world? &gt;&gt; Haven't I done all these things? Haven't Didn't I Didn't I bring you this far? Didn't I save your SIN SICK SOUL? DIDN'T I SEND MY SON TO DIE FOR YOU? WE'VE GOT SO MUCH TO THANK HIM FOR. &gt;&gt; I'M I'M SICK IN MY BODY, BUT THANK GOD FOR HEALING ME ANYWAY. &gt;&gt; OH, YEAH. I I DON'T FEEL LIKE I GOT REVIVAL, BUT THANK GOD REVIVAL'S COMING ANYWAY. &gt;&gt; I DON'T FEEL LIKE I KNOW WHAT I NEED TO KNOW IN THIS MESSAGE, BUT THANK GOD FOR SENDING A MESSAGE SO THAT HE CAN CALL ME OUT. I MAY NOT BE WHERE I WANT TO BE, BUT THANK GOD, I AIN'T WHERE I USED TO BE. I TELL YOU WHAT, I AIN'T GOING BACK TO EGYPT FOR NO MAN'S MONEY. I AIN'T GOING BACK FOR JUST BECAUSE I GOT THREE SQUARE MEALS A DAY. I TELL YOU WHERE I'M GOING. I'M HEADED TO A PROMISED LAND. I'M READY FOR A RAPTURE. I DON'T CARE IF THERE'S SOME DRY SPELLS ON THE WAY. I'M READY TO GO. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; We've stood around too LONG LOOKING AT WHAT HAS been and we we we LOOK AT WHAT SITUATION WE'RE IN AND WE FAIL TO SEE THE PROMISES THAT ARE LAYING before us. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Anybody else? &gt;&gt; Anybody? &gt;&gt; Is it? Come on, church. &gt;&gt; It happens to me. Monday morning rolls around. I'm going to tell you something. It's a hard day for a preacher because what could I have said different? Why couldn't them people Why Why IS IT THE PEOPLE ARE STILL FUSSING? WHY IS IT THEY'RE STILL FIGHTING? WHY WHY IS IT THAT I CAN'T SEEM TO GET THE BREAKTHROUGH THAT I WANT? &gt;&gt; OH MY. Come on. &gt;&gt; PREACHERS NEED BREAKTHROUGHS, TOO. &gt;&gt; PREACHERS NEED PREACHERS NEED REFILLINGS, TOO. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; PREACHERS AIN'T ANGELS. PREACHERS NEED COME ON, SOMEBODY. &gt;&gt; Anybody else? You know, WE START LIFTING EACH OTHER. WE START PUTTING EACH OTHER UP HERE. WELL, I'M STRUGGLING. DON'T TOUCH MY SITUATION, BUT THESE PEOPLE OVER HERE NEED TO BE BETTER. THEY'RE GOING THROUGH STUFF, TOO. &gt;&gt; Come on, preach. &gt;&gt; Why can't they help me? Why can't they do something for me? They're they're good, solid Christians. And you don't know the demons they're fighting on the inside. &gt;&gt; Come on, preach. &gt;&gt; Moses was fighting these devils, too. Moses is standing there trying to stand in the breach of the people, saying, "Lord, don't don't hurt the people. Don't hurt the people. I I I'll stand for them." He stood for the people so long. &gt;&gt; And he and he and he DIDN'T WANT GOD TO TAKE THE PEOPLE OUT BECAUSE HE CARED FOR THE PEOPLE. LOVED THE PEOPLE SO MUCH THAT MOSES FINALLY GOT TO A POINT AND LISTEN CHURCH, THEY TRIED TO MAKE AN IDOL AT ONE POINT. THEY THEY DECIDED, YOU KNOW WHAT? WE'RE JUST GOING TO WE'RE just going to we're just going to get all the gold. &gt;&gt; You know, the first they had they they did have a good idea to get rid of all the jewelry and the earrings. &gt;&gt; But they got it all and then they decided to make a big golden calf and worship that. These are listen, they had seen the hand of God. &gt;&gt; These people knew what God was and what God could do. And the next thing you know, just like it natural Christians will do, you'll make an idol out of something that you have no business making an idol out of. &gt;&gt; Moses is RIGHT THERE. &gt;&gt; JUST BECAUSE HE went up on the mountain for a few days, DON'T START TURNING YOUR BACK AND SAY, "WELL, WE'RE GOING TO START MAKING IDOLS. WE GOT TO START DOING SOMETHING DIFFERENT." NO. WHY DON'T YOU JUST KEEP FOLLOWING THE WORD THAT MOSES PREACHED? &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. I TELL YOU WHAT, I'M NOT GOING TO STOP AND START MAKING AN IDOL OUT OF SOMETHING IN THIS MESSAGE WHEN I'M JUST GOING TO KEEP FOLLOWING THE SAME LIVING GOD THAT THE MESSENGER OF THE HOUR PREACHED AND POINTED ME TO. &gt;&gt; LORD, &gt;&gt; you see what we can do as people, we decide, well, our leader gone. We've got to start making something else. We got to worship something. &gt;&gt; We all do. &gt;&gt; The per the quietest person in the building worships every day. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You do. You worship something. You might get up. Come on. &gt;&gt; And you worship the car that you have. You worship the job that you have. If your job is ever above anything that God has for you, think about it. It's an idol. &gt;&gt; And we've been put we've been put in a situation in life where it's hard. Are anybody with me today? &gt;&gt; Wednesday nights are hard on people. I know we have jobs. We have obligations. We have things. &gt;&gt; But did you ever read the Bible where if you put God first, God will bless you? Sir, &gt;&gt; you know, you know why we don't take that and apply it to ourselves? Because we don't really believe that God would take care of us &gt;&gt; if we put him first. &gt;&gt; What we need is revival. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; I've only got 10 minutes left. So, if you just be bear with me, we'll be okay. I'm I'm going to skip way down here. Okay. Brother Ram said, "Now, it's almost an impossible thing to get people praying, fasting, calling on the Lord. Seems like the church has got so drowsy and lazy in these last days. So pitiful. &gt;&gt; You thought I was calling you lazy. I was using a quote. &gt;&gt; So pitiful. He said, &gt;&gt; he said, "And I hate to come and just keep stirring and preaching and saying these things, but brother, sister, that's the truth. I just can't hold it. It's the gospel and it must be preached. IT'S GOT TO BE PREACHED AS A WITNESS. It's true." Are you with me today? There's a prophet telling you, "I LISTEN, I'M NOT TRYING TO MAKE THESE THINGS UP. I'M NOT BE TRYING TO BE HARD ON YOU. I'M TELLING YOU, I NEED THIS AS MUCH AS YOU need this. Every one OF US NEED A REVIVAL. WE'VE BEEN IN A DESERT PLACE. WE'VE BEEN IN A WILDERNESS JOURNEY. WE'RE ON A JOURNEY TO OUR PROMISED LAND. BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW SOMETHING THAT IF THE HOLY GHOST IS ON THE INSIDE OF YOU, THEN THE POTENTIALS OF REVIVAL IS ALREADY THERE. IF THE HOLY GHOST HAS ALREADY COME AND HAS MADE ITS HOME ON THE INSIDE OF YOU, THEN I GO AHEAD AND TELL YOU SOMETHING. YOU'RE ALREADY POTENTIALLY IN THE PROMISED LAND. IT'S TIME WE QUIT FUSSING, FIGHTING, AND LOOKING AT THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND TAKE GOD AT HIS WORD AND KEEP MOVING FORWARD. &gt;&gt; And the way we do THAT IS TO QUIT LOOKING. BROTHER SAID, NOW he he said, "Listen," he said, "I was walking down the street one day and the Holy Ghost just blessed me." He's talking about a brother here. He said, "Brother, that's true. I can't hold it." He said, "I think that we just presume too much. We we presume because we had an experience five years ago, brother Brandham. I was walking down the street one day and the Holy Ghost just blessed me. And I run down the street. I thought, Lord, you have to take take me somewhere because I'm going to misbehave on the street. Maybe you were out in the church and you got an experience. You spoke with tongues and think, well, that's all right. I can GO AHEAD NOW. OKAY, I see the rest of them doing this. You're just presuming that Israel had those experiences. Israel had come out of Egypt. Israel had seen signs and miracles and wonders all along their road. They had passed through the Red Sea as on dry land. They seen mana fall out of the heaven every night. They were witnessing the blessings OF GOD UPON THEIR LIFE. BUT WHEN THEY FAILED to disobey to obey God's commandments, what happened? The blessings got cut off from them. AND THEY PRESUMED THAT BECAUSE GOD HAD BEEN SO GOOD, he'd just be go on and be GOOD ON. BUT GOD CAN'T DO THAT. I THINK WE'VE COME TO THAT SPOT. WE'VE COME TO A CADISH BARIA WHERE GOD has given the issue for the church to call to a halt AND BACK TO PRAYER LIFE, BACK to a consecration, back to A SPOT THAT WE consecrate ourselves away from the things of the world and away from our little petty differences AMONG US AND GET BACK TO GOD AND BROTHERLY love and humility. BACK TO THE POWER OF GOD AGAIN. SEE, COME ON, CHURCH. YOU SEE WHAT A PROPHET IS SAYING? WE NEED TO HEAR THESE THINGS AND QUIT LOOKING AROUND AT THE PROBLEMS. GET BACK TO THE BLESSINGS OF GOD AGAIN. YOU THINK, come on, church. I I want to get this to you as as best I know how today. I I know this is cut up. Brother Brandham said it like this. We find out along this road after they got this they got to a place of Horb. And we find out, let's break the name down. He said, "That's where the name Horb means a dry place or a desert. And when they get out of fellowship with one another or in the church and out of fellowship with the Holy Spirit, it brings us to a dry place, a desert. Nothing alive. Everything's got stickers on it." See, a desert, a little piece of cactus with a sticker on it. Do you know what it is? That's a precious little tender leaf that hasn't had no water. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? YOU'RE A SOMETIMES THE STICKIEST NATURATURED PERSON IN THE CHURCH IS A PRECIOUS LITTLE LEAF THAT NEEDS SOME water of the Holy Ghost. COME ON, CHURCH. I'M NOT TELLING YOU YOU'RE NOT SAVED, BUT WE NEED A REVIVAL. &gt;&gt; Every one of us, IF THERE'S A STICKINESS IN YOUR NATURE, YOU NEED A REVIVAL. IF YOU'RE COMPLAINING ABOUT THE PASTOR, ABOUT THE DEACONS, ABOUT THE SONG LEADERS, ABOUT THE MUSICIANS, ABOUT ABOUT THE OTHER CHURCH MEMBERS, ABOUT THE YOUNG PEOPLE, IT'S TIME WE COME BACK AND HAD A REVIVAL. COME ON, SOMEBODY. WHAT WE NEED HERE AT WORD OF LIFE TABERNACLE IS NOT TO ANALYZE AND AND LOOK AT ALL THE OTHER CHURCHES. WELL, IF WE COULD BE LIKE THEM OR if they could be like us or if we could change THIS OR CHANGE THAT. IT'S TIME THAT WE HAVE A REVIVAL. IT'S TIME OUR YOUNG PEOPLE DECIDE THAT I'M NOT GOING TO GO AFTER THE THINGS OF THE WORLD, BUT I'M GOING TO SURRENDER IN THE HOUSE OF GOD. I NEED A REVIVAL. &gt;&gt; I THINK the ministry needs a revival. I think the deacons need a revival. Come on, church. I think the the sisters and the brothers need a revival. I think our young men need a revival. I THINK OUR YOUNG SISTERS NEED A REVIVAL. I THINK THE OLD MEN AND THE OLD WOMEN I THINK THEY NEED A REVIVAL. COME ON, CHURCH. YOU SAY, "WHY YOU KEEP SAYING IT?" CUZ MAYBE EVENTUALLY WE'LL GET IT. WE NEED A REVIVAL. &gt;&gt; We It's NOT JUST A WORD. REVIVE US AGAIN &gt;&gt; AND AGAIN AND AGAIN. AND WE NEED REVIVAL. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, in a teaching service that don't feel good." It's a revival because it's the word. &gt;&gt; See, &gt;&gt; what we think of revival &gt;&gt; is screaming, shouting, jumping. &gt;&gt; I do believe that's evidence that something may have happened on the inside. Some people, not everybody jumps, not everybody shouts, not everybody screams, not everybody hollers. But I will say this, when the word is preached or taught to the people, &gt;&gt; there will be a response in the heart of the believer. &gt;&gt; And the real revival is going to come on Monday morning. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; And then when the revival happens at home, it'll come to the house of God. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; See, when you get your home life in revival, then the church won't look so dead to you. It'll be in revival, too. Why? Because you're in it. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Come on, preach. &gt;&gt; Are you still with me tonight? Well, I would be in revival if everybody else was in revival. Trust me, as a preacher, I wish I could say that, too. &gt;&gt; Because it's easier to preach when the church is just on top of the world. &gt;&gt; It is. It re it really is. &gt;&gt; I mean, you just say anything out of the Bible, anything out of the message, and the people say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; But then the people go through a dry spell. No, I I I feel sorry for Moses. &gt;&gt; He stood there and he's preaching to two million people, and they're all complaining. And you know, complainers, it it it spreads like a disease. It spreads like a disease because the first person complains and then they complain to somebody else in the church &gt;&gt; about something that the other person don't need to even hear about &gt;&gt; and they complain and this one complains and that one complain and then next thing you know the complaining has is like a wildfire. &gt;&gt; You know, if you'd start telling your blessings to everybody in the church, &gt;&gt; come on. &gt;&gt; That spread like wildfire, too. &gt;&gt; Look what the Lord's done for me. The Lord healed me. He saved me. He delivered me. He He brought my children back. Come on, somebody. You say, "Well, it hadn't happened yet." Start confessing it and it will. &gt;&gt; You realize that we have not because we ask not. It's time we quit crying about it and speak for it. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Anybody else with me here tonight? It's time we quit crying about it and say, "Lord, I know we're going to be in revival. &gt;&gt; I know I'M IN REVIVAL. I KNOW I'M HEALED. I KNOW I'M SAVED. I KNOW I'M ONE OF YOURS." DO YOU REALIZE WHERE WE'RE AT, CHURCH? WE MIGHT BE IN A DESERT SOMETIMES IN OUR FLESH. AMEN. BUT WE NEED OUR SOULS TO BE IN REVIVAL. JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T FEEL GOOD DON'T MEAN YOU AIN'T IN REVIVAL. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Just because the church the church may go through things, you know, as a body of people when we see loss like we saw our sister Cletus that passed away. The the entire church can feel that &gt;&gt; and you feel the you you feel the effects of the loss, &gt;&gt; but you don't you don't say, "Well, she wasn't healed, so we're just going to No, she's got her ultimate healing. Sister Clelet is where right now every one of us are wanting to go. Every one of us are going to go there. I I tell you what, no doubt she's going to line up and there's not going to be a walker. There's not going to Come on, somebody. She's going to stand there in a young body going to Brother JT, when you see her, you might even have to be reintroduced to her. &gt;&gt; You realize I'm not trying TO MAKE LIGHT. WHAT I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU IS it's a reality. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; We start LOOKING AT THE DEATH. WE START LOOKING AT THE PROBLEMS. WE START LOOKING AT THE ARE YOU WITH ME NOW? WE START LOOKING AT EVERYTHING NEGATIVE BECAUSE WE'RE IN A NEGATIVE WORLD. BUT IF YOU EVER LOOK TO THE PROMISES OF GOD, THEN YOU'LL SEE THAT THE PROMISES ARE GREATER THAN THE NEGATIVITY. &gt;&gt; IF YOU EVER LOOK TO THE HEALING POWER OF GOD, IT'S GREATER THAN ANY DISEASE THAT CAN GET A HOLD OF YOU. IT'S GREATER THAN HEART DISEASE. IT'S GREATER THAN CANCER. WE DON'T FEAR IT BECAUSE OUR GOD IS BIGGER AND HE'S MORE POWERFUL. &gt;&gt; That's why he's greater than a He's greater than the army that's pursuing you. If there's a devil after you, our God is greater. &gt;&gt; All right? &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? If there's a IF THERE'S A DISEASE ON YOU, OUR GOD IS GREATER. IF YOU'RE IN NEED OF FOOD, OUR GOD CAN SUPPLY ALL YOUR NEEDS. HE'S DONE IT FOR THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. HE'S DONE IT WITH LISTEN, HE DID IT IN JESUS'S TIME. The little boy with the WITH THE WITH THE FISH AND LOAVES. HE STOOD THERE, DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH FOR JUST MAYBE ONE LITTLE INDIVIDUAL, AND HE COULD FEED 5,000 PLUS THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; Think about it. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; AND YOU SAY GOD CAN'T SUPPLY FOR ONE PERSON. GOD CAN SUPPLY FOR EVERY PERSON. GOD HAS GOT YOU IN THE PALMS OF HIS HAND. DO YOU REALIZE THAT WHEN YOU'RE GOING THROUGH A TRIAL, THINK ABOUT THIS before we close. &gt;&gt; You're going through the worst trial of your life. I don't care if it's financial. I don't care if it's sick. I do care. But whether it be financial &gt;&gt; or sickness, &gt;&gt; whether it's with your family, whether it's with your prayer life, &gt;&gt; whatever it is &gt;&gt; that has caused you problems, whatever it is that is causing you gloom and despair &gt;&gt; and ALL THESE BAD THINGS, WHATEVER IT IS, if you ever step back one time &gt;&gt; and think that God is holding you just like this &gt;&gt; and he sees every problem, &gt;&gt; he knows every situation you're in, &gt;&gt; and he already knows knows HOW YOU'RE GOING TO GET OUT of it. &gt;&gt; You don't need to know. GOD WILL TELL YOU WHEN YOU NEED TO KNOW. MAYBE GOD DON'T WANT TO TELL YOU, BUT BECAUSE MAYBE THERE'S A PROBLEM COMING THAT YOU DON'T THINK YOU COULD GET THROUGH, BUT HE'S ALREADY MADE A WAY. AND IF HE MAKES A WAY WHERE THERE IS NO COME ON, SOMEBODY SPEAK TO YOUR MOUNTAIN THIS MORNING. YOU YOU YOU OR THIS AFTERNOON, SPEAK TO YOUR MOUNTAIN. SPEAK TO YOUR CIRCUMSTANCE. IT'S TIME TO SPEAK AND GO FORWARD. WE WE'VE STAYED IN THE WILDERNESS LONG ENOUGH AND WE'VE WENT CIRCLE AFTER CIRCLE AND WE'VE COMPASSED THIS MOUNTAIN AND WE'VE DECIDED THAT MAYBE THIS IS MY DESTINY IS JUST A WILDERNESS JOURNEY. NO, GOD'S GOT A PROMISED LAND. &gt;&gt; WHAT HE NEEDS IS SOME JOSHUA AND CALEB'S TO GET READY TO GO OVER. &gt;&gt; Because when he can get a couple people that are in unity &gt;&gt; with the word of God, then we're going over across the Red Sea. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; We're going across the Jordan. Right. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham talks about our our promised land. And I'll try to get this and we'll quit. Uh, Brother Stewart, I've got a good quote for long-winded preachers. Should I read it and scare you to death? Brother Brandham said, "We got time for other things." Oh, I wish he'd hurry up and quit preaching. 20 minutes is long enough for any preacher to preach. Well, you're starving to death. You're so thin, you look like a shadow. You need a good four-hour sermon sometimes to fatten you up on gospel vitamins. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. We're just getting started. &gt;&gt; I I won't do that ever. If I do, I want you to carry me out of this church and don't ever let me come back. Brother talks about this. I'm going to close right after this quote. Like the spies on the road to the promised land, they was in an exodus coming out of Egypt. Come out by a promised word of God. God made his word known by a prophet. Moses sent him down there. He was identified that he was the God to bring him out under the conditions that he promised to the I am. When they come to the borderland, Kadis Barnea, the great mistake they made when they got to the land and looked over to the promised land, they said, "We can't take it." &gt;&gt; What was the other 10? They looked at the circumstances, the prestige that they would lose. We are grasshoppers to the side of them. But Joshua and Caleb checked up. They went back to the word sir. &gt;&gt; Now, this is where revival comes from, by the way. Back to the word. &gt;&gt; They went back to the word. And the Lord said, "I give you this land. It's a good land flowing with milk and honey." &gt;&gt; They didn't count what it looked like, what this was, and what this evidence was. God's word said, "I give it to you. Go get it." And they were the only ones that went in. Oh, let us check the promises of God for today. That's right. Remember, we're in another exodus, a time, an exodus this time, not into a promised land OF THE EARTH, BUT INTO THE PROMISED LAND OF GLORY where there is no return no more. GLORY TO GOD. HE SAID, "WE'RE GOING TO BE THERE." What did he promise before that time come? THAT THE CHURCH WOULD BE SO MUCH LIKE HIM. It would even be the same that the works that I do will you do also. We'll see again the vindicated PROMISE AGAIN AND AGAIN. I SAY BY faith tonight, WE'VE SEEN THESE THINGS. WE'RE STANDING ON THE PROMISES OF GOD AND WE ARE GOING TO A PROMISED LAND. &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT GOING TO STAY IN LEOSA. IT'S TIME WE GET OUT OF HERE. IT'S TIME WE QUIT LOOKING AROUND AND WORRYING ABOUT THE POLITICS OF THIS WORLD. We're on our way to Canaan's land. And it DON'T MATTER IF SOMEBODY TRIES TO HINDER ME. I'M GOING ON WITH JESUS JUST THE SAME. &gt;&gt; I'M NOT STOPPING. I'M NOT TURNING AROUND. IT'S NOT BETTER IN EGYPT. IT'S BETTER WHERE WE'RE GOING. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT BETTER HERE IF YOU GAVE ME $10 MILLION. MAYBE I'D HAVE A GOOD LIFE. BUT I'M GOING TO TELL YOU SOMETHING. Worry would still be there. &gt;&gt; COME ON. &gt;&gt; FEAR WOULD STILL BE THERE. &gt;&gt; ANXIETY WOULD STILL BE THERE. BUT WHERE I'M GOING, THERE IS NO MORE FEAR. THERE IS NO MORE ANXIETY. THERE IS NO MORE CANCER. THERE IS NO MORE DEATH. COME ON, SOMEBODY. THERE IS NO MORE COLD DEAD RELIGION. IT'S ALL PEACE AND JOY AND HAPPINESS. THAT'S WHERE WE'RE GOING. THIS IS JUST NOTHING BUT A SHADOW. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, LORD. &gt;&gt; BUT THE THINGS THAT ARE COMING ARE PERFECTION THAT'S COMING. HE'S JUST WAITING FOR YOU TO GET READY AND SAY, "LOOK, WE'RE GOING TO DO THE SAME THINGS." &gt;&gt; I SAY IT'S TIME THE MINISTRY CAN STAND BOLDLY ON THE PLATFORM TODAY AND CAST OUT DEMONS. &gt;&gt; Come on. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You say, "Are we scared to do that?" No, sir. We have the word of God backing us up. &gt;&gt; We do. &gt;&gt; Do you realize when we lay hands ON PEOPLE, WE'RE NOT DOING THAT FOR SHOW. &gt;&gt; Come on. Do you realize WE HAVE PEOPLE COME TO THIS ALTAR AND WE LAY HANDS ON THEM, BROTHER STEWART, Brother Ben and I, we're not doing that for show, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; WE'RE DOING THAT BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IN THE POWER OF THE WORD THAT IF THEY LAY HANDS ON THE SICK, THEY SHALL RECOVER. THAT'S WHY WHEN THE WHEN THE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE HERE AND YOU ELDERS COME AND PRAY WITH THEM, YOUR HANDS HAVE THE SAME POWER. &gt;&gt; Come on, &gt;&gt; by the authority in them. Come on, church. I'M I'M PREACHING TO YOU NOW. I'M OFF MY NOTES, BUT I WANT TO TELL YOU THIS. IT'S TIME WE REALIZE WHO WE ARE. IT'S TIME WE REALIZE WE CAN LAY HANDS ON A SICK BODY. IT'S TIME WE REALIZE THAT WE CAN TAKE THE FAITH THAT WE'VE BEEN GIVEN AND WE CAN CAST OUT DEMONS. &gt;&gt; You say, "What kind of demons can we cast out?" All of them. &gt;&gt; All of them. Brother Stewart, I don't care if it's anxiety. You know, this is an age of anxiety. &gt;&gt; It's time we just go ahead and say, "Lord, I'm going to call I'm I'm going to call for the elders of the church. They're going to lay their hands on me because I'm sick with anxiety, and it's going to be gone. And I'm not claiming anxiety no more. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Are you in depression? YOU GOT DEPRESSION SPIRIT ON YOU. &gt;&gt; I'm not asking you to raise your hand. I don't want you to even THINK ABOUT IT. I WANT YOU TO THINK LIKE THIS. If you're battling the spirit of depression, IT'S TIME TO CALL FOR the elders of the church to lay hands ON YOU AND CAST OUT THE DEVIL of depression. YOU SAY, "WELL, IT DIDN'T LEAVE ME THE NEXT DAY." HOLD ON TO THE PROMISE OF GOD. IT'S GONE IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; I TELL YOU, we prayed with PEOPLE WITH CANCER. I'VE TOLD SISTER Alice about it. I'VE TOLD HER, "WE'RE NOT GIVING UP." That that the devil of cancer is defeated. You know, JUST BECAUSE SOMEBODY GETS OVER, YOU SAY, "WELL, you're over 80 or you're you're you're in your up older years." Listen, the devil does not have to take you out. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; The devil DOES NOT HAVE ANY LEGAL RIGHTS ON YOUR BODY. THE DEVIL DOES NOT HAVE ANY LEGAL RIGHTS ON YOUR FAMILY. IT'S TIME WE START CLAIMING THEM AGAIN AND BELIEVING THAT THE PROMISES WILL COME TO PASS. &gt;&gt; I understand that death is just a change and we shouldn't fear it. Come on. &gt;&gt; But we don't have to die sick. &gt;&gt; Do you realize the perfect will of God is for your healing? &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; And you say, "Well, is it my faith? Is it my faith?" Just believe. &gt;&gt; And whatever happens, &gt;&gt; I'm going to hold on to faith. &gt;&gt; I'm going to believe anyway. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I don't care what the doctor's report at the finals do at the final doctor's exam. When he says, "I can't do nothing more for you." You can walk out of there and say, "Thank God for healing me." &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. Come on now. &gt;&gt; When he says, "I can't do nothing." I think of brother Robert tonight. &gt;&gt; They want to do a heart transplant. Well, if the doctors can't find you a heart, I know somebody that created the heart. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord, &gt;&gt; Sister Alice. When the doctor says you need certain medication or you or maybe it won't work or we don't even know. We we we don't know IF THERE'S A WAY TO CURE YOU OR NOT. I KNOW SOMEBODY WHO CAN HEAL ALL YOUR DISEASES. COME ON, SOMEBODY. YOU YOUNG PEOPLE THAT ARE FIGHTING DEVILS OF PORNOGRAPHY, I KNOW SOMEBODY WHO CAN DELIVER YOU FROM THAT DEMON HERE TONIGHT. FOR YOU PEOPLE THAT ARE FIGHTING, I TELL YOU WHAT, YOU SAY, "MY MARRIAGE IS ON THE ROCKS. I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN MAKE IT. I KNOW SOMEBODY WHO'S GOT A HE'S GOT A DOSE OF LOVE READY FOR YOU TONIGHT." &gt;&gt; DO YOU REALIZE WHAT WE NEED IN THE HOUSE OF GOD IS TO LET GOD HAVE HIS WAY? &gt;&gt; We we we think we've got to we got to figure it out. This is how God's going to do it this service and that service. And I tell you what, it's time we just let God BE GOD. IT'S TIME WE JUST GO AHEAD AND SAY, "I don't care about the armies that's chasing me. I don't I know that he's a rock in a weary land. I know he's a shelter in THE TIME OF STORM. I KNOW HE IS THE HIGH PRIEST OF MY PROFESSION. I KNOW HE'S GOD. &gt;&gt; I'M NOT GIVING UP. I'M NOT TURNING AROUND. I'M GOING TO KEEP MOVING FORWARD BY THE GRACE OF GOD. BROTHER BRANDON SAID WE'RE in an Exodus. Are you in an Exodus today? You realize we've been called by the same vindication that the children of Israel was. &gt;&gt; I'm going to I'm going to leave you with this. And I know I lied to you already. If you're watching at home, I apologize. You can turn this off anytime you want to. You realize that the mana was a revival. It caused a revival for a while. The rock in a weary land, the water that came from the rock, you realize that created revival for a while, but then the next thing you know, it gets stagnant and it gets stale. Not because the water changed, not because the mana changed. It's because the people started looking around and wanting something different. &gt;&gt; And I wonder today if we'd quit looking around and say, "Lord, I want it my way or I'm just going to I'm not going to be happy. I want it my way or I just can't shout in church. I want my songs or I can't worship. I want I want my singers to sing or I I don't I'm just going to leave mad. I want the preacher to preach on this and God told him to preach something else. &gt;&gt; And the next thing you know, &gt;&gt; we're at war one with one another and Satan has got you right where he wants you. &gt;&gt; Sitting in the house of God fussing. &gt;&gt; He don't care if you're here &gt;&gt; if you're fussing. Brother Joel, is there problems like that in this church? This is one of the finest groups of people I've ever been around and had the privilege of preaching to. You really are. I don't say that because I go to church here. I say that because you really are. I I would hear I would hear if there was a lot of fussing and feuding going on. We don't have that in this church. And I thank God for that. &gt;&gt; It's commendable to a church this size. &gt;&gt; We don't We're not the biggest church, but we're a good group of people. And I'm going to go ahead and tell you something. A church this size that that can really just seem to get along as well as we do. &gt;&gt; But watch out. &gt;&gt; Satan wants to come among you. &gt;&gt; He wants to get on your shoulder &gt;&gt; and tell you somebody didn't shake your hand. That's right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And if he can get you distracted, Pharaoh's army will come in. And when you finally see it, you're scared to death. Keep your eyes on the promise. &gt;&gt; If you would look to the promise, none of these things matter. &gt;&gt; We're in a word revival today. &gt;&gt; And I believe the world is dying for what we have. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; We ought to be thankful for what we have. &gt;&gt; The world's dying, but the bride's getting ready to fly. The world's going down, but we're going up. &gt;&gt; That's why I don't believe in preaching doom and gloom to the people that your kids might not make it. &gt;&gt; I don't believe in preaching that to you people. &gt;&gt; I don't believe in telling you that you might not make it. I believe you will. &gt;&gt; Because I don't believe I'm preaching to the world. I believe I'm preaching to the bride. &gt;&gt; And if all I've got to preach is you may not make it. You may not listen. I I believe in preaching exactly what a prophet said. And he tells us we get cold, we get indifferent, we have problems. The stickiest nature in the building is just a flower that needs water. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; What the prophet said, he said, "It's a little cactus just needs water." &gt;&gt; Brother Stewart, Brother Ben, we we all need water. &gt;&gt; From the ministers, from the front to the back, everything in between. We need water. &gt;&gt; We need revival. &gt;&gt; I don't care if I jump and shout, but I want to live the life. &gt;&gt; I MAY NOT SCREAM AND HOLLER LIKE EVERYBODY, BUT AND that's okay. I want it however it comes. If the hol if the effects of the Holy Ghost come upon you and you scream and stagger and whatever you do, don't I ain't going to criticize you. I'm going to praise the Lord for that. And if the Lord does it for me, I want you to do the same thing. We don't criticize. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're not in a spirit of criticism. I thought this was my thought. I don't want to be crowned a crab old man or woman. &gt;&gt; I don't want that spirit on me. &gt;&gt; I by nature I fight criticism. I fight a critical spirit by nature. I fight legalism &gt;&gt; by nature. &gt;&gt; I fight things where it's hard sometimes to just get a clear just being honest with you. &gt;&gt; It's by nature. But my nature on this flesh is not ever going to be converted. &gt;&gt; But there's something on the inside of me that is crying out for more of him. &gt;&gt; THERE'S SOMETHING ON THE INSIDE OF ME THAT I DON'T I JUST DON'T WANT TO MISS CHURCH. &gt;&gt; I don't feel I'm missing the rapture if I miss it. I don't feel I'm going to hell if I miss it. He did a lot for me. I'm going to do the least I can do. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; He did a lot for me. He brought me from places I never Listen, church, musicians, come. My time's up. Can I go ahead and tell you something? We went Every one of you could have a testimony. I've been through a lot. &gt;&gt; But he brought you from your Egypt to the promised land. &gt;&gt; He delivered you to take you in. But if you're in the middle of your journey and you find yourself hungry, he can provide food for you. &gt;&gt; If you find yourself thirsty, Brother Matthew, he can provide water for you. &gt;&gt; If you find yourself getting cold in the house of God, don't ever let the devil tell you, "Maybe I should just quit." It's the time for a refreshing. &gt;&gt; When you feel like revival can't come, be the revival. WHEN YOU FEEL LIKE EVERYTHING'S AGAINST YOU IN THIS WORLD, and it may be because the world is never going to love the way we act. It's never going to it's never going to understand. Why would you go to church twice on Sunday? Why would you go to church on a Wednesday night? You don't need that. Why would you drive for church? There's one right down the street. But we know what we've got here. I I'm I'm telling you here today. &gt;&gt; I have you forgotten. &gt;&gt; We've been through some trials, but look where God's brought us now. &gt;&gt; We've been through Come on, church. Do you realize that that if you would quit looking at the problems and start looking at where Listen, look at the blessings of God on this church. &gt;&gt; I I could I could start naming them off. I can look at Sister Stephanie with her hand in the air and I can tell you God has done miraculous and marvelous things for Sister Stephanie. I can tell you. Amen. S you look at sister Alice AND SAY CANCER'S GOT HER BODY. I can TELL YOU GOD IS DOING marvelous and miraculous things for our sister Alice. Come on somebody. I can look here today and I can see BROTHER LEVI AS A YOUNG MAN. He can he can look BACK AND SAY I STRUGGLED BUT LOOK WHERE HE'S AT TODAY. GOD COME ON SOMEBODY. GOD WHO IS RICH IN MERCY HAS BROUGHT YOU TO THIS PLACE BUT HE WANTS YOU IN REVIVAL. BROTHER GABE, SATAN TRIED TO GET YOU BUT HE COULDN'T TAKE YOU OUT. SISTER JANIE, THE DEVIL'S TRIED TO GIVE YOU HARDSHIP IN YOUR LIFE, BUT GOD HAS STILL GOT YOU HERE, AND IT'S A PURPOSE IN IT. COME ON, SOMEBODY. I WISH SOMEBODY COULD RECOGNIZE THE GOODNESS OF GOD HERE FOR A MINUTE. SISTER HELEN, SATAN'S TRIED TO TAKE YOU OUT, BUT GOD'S GOT YOU. &gt;&gt; PHARAOH'S ARMY'S TRIED TO COME. &gt;&gt; But greater is what we're following &gt;&gt; than what's trying to come AFTER US. BROTHER MATTHEW, SATAN'S TRIED TO TAKE YOU OUT MANY TIMES, BUT YOU FOUND YOURSELF SITTING IN THE HOUSE OF GOD WITH YOUR HAND RAISED WORSHIPING GOD. COME ON, SOMEBODY. IF YOU NEED A BREAKTHROUGH, IT'S TIME FOR A BREAKTHROUGH. IF YOU SAY, "I I NEED MORE OF GOD." STAND AND GIVE GOD PRAISE AND SAY, "LORD, I NEED MORE OF YOU." &gt;&gt; WE'VE COMPASSED THIS MOUNTAIN LONG ENOUGH. IT'S TIME THAT WE RECOGNIZE WHO WE ARE. IT'S TIME WE RECOGNIZE, SISTER STEPHANIE, THAT GOD'S GOT YOUR SITUATION. IT'S TIME WE QUIT LOOKING AT ALL THE PROBLEMS in our church and in our families. I tell you what, &gt;&gt; think about sister Anna. She went years WHERE SHE NEVER PLAYED THE PIANO BECAUSE SATAN HAD HER IN BONDAGE. But tonight, she's sitting IN THE HOUSE OF GOD WORSHIPING BY THE WAY OF MUSIC. WHAT IS IT? GOD WHO IS RICH IN MERCY. &gt;&gt; Brother Stewart is a young man. Maybe you'd have looked at his life as a young man and SAID HE'LL NEVER BE A PREACHER. BUT HERE he is tonight STANDING AS A DEACON AND A MINISTER OF THE GOSPEL. I'M TALKING ABOUT WHAT GOD IS DOING. IT'S A POSITIVE THING THAT GOD HAS DONE. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I think of Sister Millie. She can't have a baby. &gt;&gt; She's got she's got arthritis. SHE SHE'S NEVER GOING TO BE EVER ABLE TO HAVE CHILDREN. BUT THE WORD SAID DIFFERENT. WE'VE GOT REAL TESTIMONIES, RIGHT? COME ON, SOMEBODY. I'll tell you what, why can't WE JUST START DWELLING ON THE TESTIMONIES AND TELL THAT DEVIL HE HAS NO RIGHT among our church building. We we WE'VE SAT HERE LONG ENOUGH AND TRIED TO SAY THAT THE DEVIL'S GOING TO DO THIS AND the devil's GOING TO DO THAT. I TELL YOU WHAT, THE DEVIL'S GOING TO TRY TO DO A LOT OF THINGS, BUT HE WILL NOT SUCCEED BECAUSE I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, LIKE a prophet said it. A prophet said, if you're the skin on the bottom of the foot of the body of Christ, then every devil is under your feet. IF HE'S UNDER YOUR FEET, THEN WHY ARE YOU WORRYING? &gt;&gt; ALL YOU GOT TO DO IS STEP ON HIM AND SAY, "SATAN, YOU can't have me." &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I tell you what, I see I see a I see people out here with their hands up and they're crying. I'm going to tell you something. It's time you go ahead and just thank God for what he's done for you. &gt;&gt; It's time you go, "BROTHER JOEL, WHAT YOU DOING?" I TELL YOU WHAT WHAT I LIKE TO SEE IN THE HOUSE OF GOD. I IT'S TIME WE QUIT WORRYING ABOUT WHAT THE WORLD THINKS ABOUT US. IT'S TIME WE QUIT THINKING, "WELL, FOOTBALL STARTS AT 7:00. I GOT TO GET HOME AND WATCH THE GAME." IS GOD NOT IMPORTANT ENOUGH FOR US? &gt;&gt; Is he worthy of our time? &gt;&gt; Well, I'm tired, Brother Joel. We do a lot of things that make us tired. &gt;&gt; Not very many of them bother us, but we sure like to put a limit on God, don't we? church, we need a refilling here today. &gt;&gt; We need a renewing. &gt;&gt; It's time. YOUNG PEOPLE, I TELL YOU WHAT, I'VE seen the tenderness in our young people's hearts. I've seen their their willingness to sing and their willingness to worship and their willingness WHEN THEY FEEL AN URGE TO PRAY, THEY'LL COME TO THE ALTAR. I THINK WE NEED TO QUIT CRITICIZING and join them once in a while. I TELL YOU WHAT, SOMETIMES OUR ELDERS, come on, church, our elders are the best elders in the message. best people I know. But every one of us, including you, I don't care if you've been in the message 50 years, you need a revival. &gt;&gt; It'll make you talk different, act different, walk different. Brother Joel, we need a revival. Every one of us need a revival. I tell you right now, I think brothers and sist brothers and brothers, sisters, sisters, put your hands on somebody. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Lay hands on one another right here in the building. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what. I'll tell you what we're going to do. Do you realize that what we're doing right now is according to the Bible, you're laying hands on one another? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Do you realize the power of laying hands? According to the word of God, if you lay hands on the sick, they shall recover. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; You don't have to stand here. My hands don't have to be on you. BUT WHEN YOU LAY HANDS ON SOMEBODY, do you realize the power that God has given you? It's an authority. And according to the word of God, if you're sick right now, claim your healing. IF THERE'S A SPIRIT OF INDIFFERENCE ON YOU TONIGHT, CLAIM YOUR HEALING. I want you to do me THIS FAVOR. I WANT EVERY one of you to pray for the person next to you. You don't have whether you just go ahead and pray aloud. Pray what you want to do. I WANT THIS CHURCH TO JUST PRAY. LISTEN, CHURCH, YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE UP HERE TO GET HEALED. You don't have to be up here. I THINK OF MY BROTHER DANNY SITTING OVER HERE. Sister Vickiy's got hands on him. THAT'S ENOUGH POWER TO HEAL that leg trouble he's going through. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Thank you for coming, Lord. &gt;&gt; He's an elder sitting here in the church going through things. I'm looking around. I see problems in the church. I SEE WHAT THE DEVIL'S TRIED TO DO. BUT GREATER IS HE THAT IS IN THE HANDS THAT ARE LAID ON YOU IN THE BODY OF CHRIST THAT IS PRAYING FOR YOU. I want you to pray right now. I want to pray for these on the platform. You pray right where you are. &gt;&gt; Pray for one another. Just just open your open your let the voice go and say, "Lord, I'm praying. I I want A REVIVAL. I NEED A REVIVAL. THE PERSON NEXT TO ME, THEY THEY NEED A REVIVAL. I want you to just close your eyes and pray right now for that person next to you. Oh God, God every Lord Brother disease every spirit of anxiety. I pray Lord for this public. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord Jesus. Wonder if you could just raise your hands and give God praise in the building. Give God praise in the building. If you NEED A BREAKTHROUGH TONIGHT, JUST TAKE YOUR BREAKTHROUGH. I'M NOT GIVING UP. DIDN'T HE WALK ON THE WATER? &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Some thought he was a ghost. &gt;&gt; SOME THOUGHT IT WAS JUST ANOTHER SPIRIT, BUT IT WAS CHRIST WALKING ON THAT WATER. &gt;&gt; Tell you what, you may be on the You may be sinking in the middle of the ocean right here tonight. &gt;&gt; But he's reaching out a hand for you. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. You say, "Is anything too hard for God?" Nothing's too HARD FOR GOD. WHATEVER YOUR PROBLEM IS HERE TONIGHT, HE CAN TAKE CARE OF IT BEFORE YOU WALK OUT them doors. Can you just RAISE YOUR HAND? SAY, "I ACCEPT MY HEALING. I ACCEPT WHAT GOD'S DONE FOR ME." &gt;&gt; You say, "BROTHER JOEL, YOU'RE TRYING TO WORK THE PEOPLE." NO, I'M TELLING YOU WHAT GOD'S ALREADY DONE FOR YOU. I AIN'T WORKING YOU UP. I'M TELLING YOU, YOU ARE THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; You are she. YOU ARE THE ONES THAT GOD HAS CALLED. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Anybody feel like worshiping now? Anybody feel? I'll tell you what. If the chains are broken, I want your hands in the air. &gt;&gt; You know, think about it. A free person can raise their hands, not because they want to, BUT BECAUSE THEY'RE DEFYING GRAVITY THAT'S TRYING TO hold them down. You are raising YOUR HANDS TO DEFY GRAVITY RIGHT HERE TONIGHT BECAUSE GOD HAS PUT SOMETHING IN YOUR HEART to say, "Lord, I'm delivered. I'M FREE. I'M NOT EVEN GOING TO DWELL ON THE THINGS THAT HAVE HINDERED ME IN MY PAST. I'M GOING FORWARD." SOMEBODY GIVE GOD PRAISE IN THE BUILDING. &gt;&gt; SOMEBODY SAY, "PRAISE THE LORD. Go ahead, just keep telling him how much you love him. I wonder if YOU CAN JUST POUR YOUR PRAISE OUT WITH YOUR LIPS RIGHT NOW. SAY HOW MUCH YOU LOVE HIM. SOME SAY HOW MUCH YOU THANK HIM FOR. SOMEBODY START TESTIFYING IN THE BUILDING OF WHAT GOD'S DONE FOR YOU. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Brother Joel, we need some order in here. Excuse me. Let's get out of order just long enough to have some saving in the house of God. LET'S GET OUT OF ORDER LONG ENOUGH TO HAVE SOME HEALING IN THE HOUSE OF GOD. MUST GET OUT OF ORDER LONG ENOUGH TO SEE SOME YOUNG PEOPLE FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST. How many of you has been baptized? &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Your promise is the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Your promise is the Holy Ghost. Don't let the DEVIL STOP YOU SHORT OF YOUR PROMISE. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; How many of you have been baptized over here? &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Your promise is the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; If that DEVIL COMES TELLING YOU, "I AIN'T GOT THE HOLY GHOST." COME ON, SOMEBODY. &gt;&gt; You young people, the devil's COMING TO TELL YOU, "I DON'T THINK I GOT THE HOLY GHOST." TELL THAT DEVIL HE'S A LIAR. &gt;&gt; You realize you CAN WALK OUT ON FAITH WITH THE WORD OF GOD AND SAY, "I'VE BEEN BAPTIZED. I'VE BEEN FILLED. I'VE GOT THE HOLY GHOST AND SATAN CANNOT HAVE ME. I AM GOD'S PROPERTY." &gt;&gt; Young people, can somebody just You young people, &gt;&gt; I know sometimes you don't want to worship because you're sitting on the front and you're thinking, "Everybody's looking at me." I'll tell you something. Greater is he that is in you than every devil that's going to fight you. Every devil's coming against you. Greater is he that is in you. &gt;&gt; If you've been baptized, you will be filled with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Fear will try to come and say, "When when's it going to happen? Can it is it really going to happen?" And you find yourself in the middle of that journey. I don't think it's going to happen. It's been too long. It's yours. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Young ladies, I'm telling you, God's got you. &gt;&gt; You quit letting the devil tell you you're not going to make it. You're going to make it. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; God will have a bride. &gt;&gt; And if if if if one generation gets too old and they go to be with the Lord, then you are that generation that may go in. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; There will be a generation go all the way. There will be a generation that will not taste death. I I know I'm lingering tonight, but I see the faces OF THE PEOPLE. AND SOME of you just NEED TO HAVE A BREAKTHROUGH TONIGHT. YOU LAID HANDS on each other and you believe that the power of God is real. IF HE'S REAL, ACCEPT WHAT HE'S DONE FOR YOU HERE TONIGHT. LISTEN, you young people, I'm going to tell you what the devil's going to tell you. He told me, too. &gt;&gt; He'll tell you, &gt;&gt; you'll never be good enough to be the bride. &gt;&gt; You're never going to make it. Maybe I Maybe my parents were message people, but do maybe I'm not supposed to be &gt;&gt; God didn't place you here by chance. &gt;&gt; He placed you here because he needed a bride. &gt;&gt; Brother Stewart, he didn't place you into a message BELIEVING HOME BY CHANCE. HE NEEDED MINISTERS TO TAKE THIS MESSAGE and preach it until the coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Thank you, &gt;&gt; brother Gab. It wasn't by chance. You were BORN IN BROTHER DAVID'S HOME. &gt;&gt; It was predestination, NOT CHANCE. &gt;&gt; We don't believe in luck. We believe it. Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; We don't believe this was lucky, Sister Stephanie, THAT YOU CAME BACK. THE DEVIL'S GOING TO FIGHT YOU, BUT YOU'VE ALREADY WON. &gt;&gt; Sister Helen, THE DEVIL'S FOUGHT YOU LONG ENOUGH. YOU'RE A WINNER, &gt;&gt; Brother Herald. Satan puts you through hell and back in the last few years. &gt;&gt; The man's lost children, lost a wife. I'm going to go ahead and tell you something. The man's a testimony that he's still serving God. &gt;&gt; HE STILL BELIEVES GOD. HE'S GOT A SON PREACHING THE GOSPEL, PASTOR OF THE CHURCH. HE STILL BELIEVES GOD BECAUSE HE KNOWS THAT HE'S GOING TO SEE HIM AGAIN. Brother Bill, you got family all around you sitting in church right now. Sister Sharon, you got family all around you sitting in church. &gt;&gt; It was worth holding on all these years to what God had FOR YOU. IT'S PAYING OFF IN THE CHILDREN AND THE GRANDCHILDREN AND THE GREAT GRANDCHILDREN. I TELL YOU WHAT, IT'S WORTH IT TO SEE THE ELDERS STILL COMING TO THE HOUSE OF GOD BECAUSE OUR YOUNG PEOPLE NEED IT. &gt;&gt; Sister Jackie, YOU'VE GOT CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN SERVING THE LORD. And the ones that ain't SERVING THE LORD, THEY'RE COMING BACK. BROTHER HARVEY, YOU AIN'T GOT TO HAVE no devil tried to take this little man out. He tried to tell this boy right here that he can't be used of God. He's tried to give him a spirit of all kinds of Tell you what, he's tried to give him so much nervousness he can't think straight. But that devil's defeated right here, Petty. &gt;&gt; Said, "Brother Joel, I don't know what you're doing. I'm telling you what I'm doing. I'm slaying devils right now. Sister Noly, the devil tried TO TAKE YOU OUT, BUT YOU'RE HERE. I tell you what, Sister Gloria, just a few years ago, you wasn't sitting here. I tell you what I remember. I remember her husband, Brother Wes, calling me. He called me up just out of the blue. He found my found my number on a church flyer. He called me up and he said, "Would it be okay if we come and fellowship with y'all and and come to a meeting?" And they came to the meeting. And then they started coming and fellowshipping and God saw fit to bring her here to THE CHURCH. BUT THAT'S NOT ALL. It's not about just adding members. But then Ryan goes over there to youth camp and receives the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Now you say, "Well, he received the Holy Ghost. Is the devil going to fight him?" He's going to fight him harder now &gt;&gt; because he's got the HOLY GHOST. BUT I'M NOT GOING TO STAND HERE. &gt;&gt; I am NOT GOING TO STAND HERE AND LET THE DEVIL WIN my brother Ryan. I'm going to stand HERE AND SAY I'M NOT GOING TO LOOK AT THE MISTAKES. FOR THE RYAN MAKES. BUT I'M HOLDING ON TO WHAT I SAW AT YOUTH CAMP WAS A YOUNG MAN SURRENDER his heart to the Lord. &gt;&gt; I was there. &gt;&gt; I was there when it happened. &gt;&gt; I saw it. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; I saw it. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I don't see my brother Landon here tonight. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's in the back room. &gt;&gt; I watched that young man at youth camp a couple years ago. I watched him come through that line. I'm sorry. If you got to go, you're free to go. I'm going to tell the devil why he's losing right now. Yes, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; I watched Brother L. You I tell you what, some of y'all want to know why it's important they go to youth camp. &gt;&gt; You can have it here or anywhere, but he got an atmosphere that was so powerful. &gt;&gt; He come through that prayer line. And I'll tell you what, that wasn't no shy young man did. &gt;&gt; I tell you, I saw the Holy Ghost come on him and he was weeping and crying and pouring his heart out. I'M NOT TRYING TO EMBARRASS MY BROTHER, BUT HE KNOWS THERE WAS A CHANGE IN THAT DAY. I've seen it all over him. I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND TELL YOU SOMETHING. SATAN LOST SOMEBODY THAT DAY. I'm looking right here in the front row right now. I wish you could see the faces of the YOUNG SISTERS OVER HERE. GOD'S DOING SOMETHING FOR THEM RIGHT NOW. WHY? Because the devil IS LOSING BECAUSE WE'RE TESTIFYING THAT GOD HAS ALREADY WON. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; You can have your religion, but right now we're we're killing devils. And these young ladies are standing here and the Lord is moving all over them. Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; You can tell me to quit all you want to, but there's young ladies here. They're balling their eyes out, ready to experience God. &gt;&gt; I think we need to take time for our young people, church. &gt;&gt; It's time we quit just playing church. Why play church? Why check a box? Why not have church? &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; The word went forth and TOLD YOU THAT JUST AS PHARAOH'S ARMY WAS DROWNED in the sea, EVERY ONE OF YOUR ENEMIES ARE DEAD. SISTER MILLIE, I SEE THE HOLY GHOST WORKING ALL OVER YOU RIGHT NOW. Just go ahead and raise your hands and accept THAT GOD HAS GIVEN you the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Raise your hands right there, young lady. The Holy Gh Come on, somebody. Brother Joel, YOU'RE MAKING US EMOTIONAL. I TELL YOU WHAT, WE NEED A LITTLE BIT OF MOTION SOMETIMES TO REMEMBER WHO OUR GOD IS. &gt;&gt; We need to know. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you, &gt;&gt; Sister Bella. He's brought you a long way. He sent you here in the house of God and the word is working every day on her. &gt;&gt; I'm stood here and preached to her and I'm telling you right now, you can tell when the word starts getting effect on people. &gt;&gt; I look at brother Riley standing there. He ain't the loudest person in the building, but I see his faithfulness to the house of God. And buddy, that's going to pay off for your family. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Go ahead. Faithfulness is important. I see Sister Sanders standing here. &gt;&gt; Satan has fought her and her children for most people would have already given up. Couple years ago, we was driving driving to a tent meeting down here and she's sitting there telling us testimonies about really telling us what she'd been through. And the fact that she was still going to a meeting and ready to hear the word of God tells me that Satan still didn't win. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; THOSE CHILDREN MAY NOT BE HERE PHYSICALLY, BUT YOU HAVEN'T LOST one of them. &gt;&gt; Sister Emma, I remember when you couldn't sing at church because the devil had you bound. But now I've heard you sing PRAISES TO GOD. WHAT IS IT? IT'S GOD DOING SOMETHING FOR THE YOUNG PEOPLE. GOD DOING SOMETHING FOR THE OLD PEOPLE. GOD HAS NO limit to what his power can do. I look at brother JT. He may not feel like much sitting back there on the back row, BUT GOD'S GOT YOU HERE FOR A PURPOSE. It's important that he's still able to come to the house of God. Can we just go ahead and take one more minute and say this? &gt;&gt; If you need the Holy Ghost, you ain't got to feel it. &gt;&gt; Accept it. &gt;&gt; Brother Joel, You didn't call me out tonight. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what, Lord, &gt;&gt; Brother Stewart, Sister Allison, 12 years today, that's a testament that God still has young people that can get married, have a family, go to church, put God first, and they can Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; They can still BE OVERCOMERS IN AN AGE WE live in. We ain't got to We ain't got to raise a bunch of worldly people that are just a bunch OF PERVERTS AND PEOPLE THAT ARE TRYING TO GO AFTER THE THINGS OF THE WORLD. WE'VE GOT PEOPLE HERE WHO LOVE GOD. YES, YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE MISTAKES. YES, YOU'RE GOING TO DO SOMETHING THAT YOU MAY NOT BE PROUD OF, BUT GOD IS LEADING YOU. &gt;&gt; DON'T GIVE UP. &gt;&gt; I wonder if we could sing that song. &gt;&gt; You're worth worthy of it all. Do you believe he's worthy here tonight? I'm sorry I held you long. &gt;&gt; But what I felt right here at the end was to keep going because I saw the I &gt;&gt; I wish he could just I wish every minister could stand right here and look at what I'm looking at right now. It's hard to quit when the young people are standing there receiving &gt;&gt; more of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Brother Bobby, your family's in church because you've surrendered your life to Christ. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Brother Bobby. &gt;&gt; Brother Bobby. See, he's let his life do his testifying for him. &gt;&gt; But your family's coming back. I'm &gt;&gt; not talking about your your children. They're already here. But your family's coming back. Sister Robin's sitting there and I tell you what, you know, I think about brother Kevin just come to my mind. We ain't losing brother Kevin. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, where's he at tonight?" God's got him. &gt;&gt; God's got brother Kevin. &gt;&gt; There's a lot of people may not be here tonight, BUT I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE UP ON THEM. WHY? BECAUSE GOD'S NOT GIVING UP. God's got a God's got a people. Church, we've complained long enough. We've looked at problems long enough. &gt;&gt; If we would come to the house of God and look at every testimony, let me tell you the greatest testimony in the building. I haven't mentioned it yet. How many in here saved? Look at the testimonies in the building. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; That is the greatest testimony, Brother Stewart, in the whole building. There are people sitting here tonight who are saved and FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST. WHY? NOT BECAUSE A MAN STOOD HERE AND PREACHED, BUT BECAUSE THE WORD CAME IN YOUR HEART. I THINK WHAT WE HAD TONIGHT WAS A LITTLE REVIVAL. DON'T LET THE REVIVAL DIE TOMORROW. LET'S KEEP ON THIS REVIVAL. &gt;&gt; What you heard this morning about revival. &gt;&gt; Don't wait for the stirring of the water. Don't wait for Don't wait for a man to come by and bring revival. &gt;&gt; Be the revival. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Right here tonight, I feel revival in the building. I really do. I I it ain't about feelings, but I feel it here. And I just as WELL I'D RATHER FEEL IT THAN NOT FEEL IT. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; Sister Reagan, I've sat here and watched you worship all night long. You are not going to be lost, but you are a daughter of God. &gt;&gt; Sister Kennedy, I'm sitting here watching you right now. I tell Listen, these young ladies right here had a breakthrough tonight. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Where Sister L at? My last one, I'll stop. She's got a gift of God. You think the devil's not going to try to go after a gift? But she's using the gift to serve God. Lord, &gt;&gt; I say don't stop giving that gift to God. &gt;&gt; Don't stop using your gift for God. &gt;&gt; Don't stop. Why?
