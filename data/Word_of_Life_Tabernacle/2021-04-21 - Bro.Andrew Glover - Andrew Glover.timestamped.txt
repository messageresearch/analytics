[31:58] and you know it's not how many of us
[32:01] there are but it's how prepared we are
[32:03] to receive from the gift of god because
[32:06] it
[32:07] is a gift to you the gift is not for
[32:09] itself
[32:10] the gift is for you and brother andrew
[32:13] was in the area
[32:14] turkey hunting so i kind of impressed
[32:16] him into service and
[32:18] and but the gift is for you and if
[32:20] there's a gift there then there's
[32:21] something in you to respond to that
[32:23] whatever you have need of god can speak
[32:26] to you
[32:27] on a wednesday night but david no matter
[32:29] what how did how
[32:30] bad that need is god can speak to you
[32:33] and maybe you made an effort to come to
[32:35] church on a wednesday night and you're
[32:36] tired and
[32:37] a bit weary but that's the time when god
[32:40] speaks to you the most
[32:42] and he says i love you and i want to i
[32:45] want to provide for you i want to help
[32:46] you i want to correct you whatever that
[32:48] it is and we say
[32:49] yes lord but you've got to pull on the
[32:52] gift you're going to say amen to the
[32:53] word tonight

[33:20] he's also been sick and there's several
[33:21] churches dealing with that again

[33:28] that devil do you believe that today
[33:30] we've seen him do it we're not just
[33:34] talking about a god that we don't know
[33:36] there's a place in the scripture where
[33:38] it said that
[33:39] he said that the the children of israel
[33:40] don't know me don't know me by my name
[33:43] yet

[33:47] they knew who he was but they didn't
[33:48] know him by the reality of
[33:50] the promise fulfilled they they knew him
[33:53] by the promise but not the fulfilled
[33:55] promise

[36:55] you know people that love the church are
[36:57] there on sunday morning he said then

[37:05] circumstances where people can't
[37:07] maybe be here distance and things but
[37:09] isn't it good to be in the house of god

[37:14] him and amen not just a sunday morning

[37:52] time where your prophet's words are
[37:54] being fulfilled that
[37:55] lord before destruction can come the
[37:57] people must get in the
[37:59] spirit of destruction at the same time
[38:01] before lord revival can come or
[38:03] deliverance or rapture

[38:07] rapture lord i believe here tonight as a
[38:09] group of people that is not lord looking

[40:09] commandments contained
[40:10] in ordinances for to make himself of

[40:14] so making peace and that he might
[40:16] reconcile both unto god in one body
[40:19] by the cross having slain the enmity
[40:21] thereby
[40:22] and came and preached peace to you which
[40:25] were
[40:26] far off and to them that were nigh for
[40:28] through him
[40:29] we both have access by one spirit
[40:32] unto the father amen through him we both
[40:36] have access by one spirit
[40:38] unto the father then paul comes in the
[40:40] in ephesians the third chapter
[40:42] in the 11th verse and he's speaking here
[40:45] on the purpose of god
[40:46] in the 11th verse he says according to
[40:49] the eternal purpose
[40:50] which he hath purposed in christ jesus
[40:52] our lord
[40:53] in whom we have boldness now notice what
[40:55] he joins now with access

[41:10] evening to add the blessing to the
[41:11] reading of his word

[41:14] few moments we want to say it's an
[41:17] honor to be here and appreciate brother
[41:18] ben for allowing us to speak to you
[41:19] tonight and
[41:20] amen we want to by the help of the lord
[41:22] just to speak to you here on a fault
[41:24] if i tell this tonight i want to talk to
[41:26] you for a few moments on access
[41:28] granted by the spirit access
[41:32] amen granted by the spirit the prophet
[41:34] of god will actually uh
[41:35] pray here in a message how the angel
[41:37] came to me in 1953 he says now we bow
[41:40] our heads just a moment for prayer
[41:42] he said our heavenly father we come
[41:44] tonight to worship thee
[41:45] and we're thankful for the opportunity
[41:47] that we have of coming
[41:49] he said and through this channel of holy
[41:51] spirit which has been bought by the
[41:53] blood of jesus christ
[41:55] he says that we have access to the
[41:57] throne of grace
[41:59] amen through the name of jesus we have
[42:02] we have access to the throne of grace
[42:04] amen through the name of jesus and we
[42:07] are so happy about it think about that
[42:09] tonight
[42:09] that a prophet of god is not putting
[42:11] this in the future amen that someday
[42:13] we're going to have
[42:14] access but he's actually saying we now
[42:16] have access
[42:18] amen to the throne of grace through the
[42:20] name of jesus and we're happy about it
[42:22] tonight now
[42:23] we live in a day and time where people
[42:25] are always trying
[42:27] amen to find access trying to get into
[42:29] something looking for something as a
[42:30] matter of fact you'll find
[42:32] that they're not just looking for any
[42:33] kind of access but they begin to look
[42:35] for the easiest way of access you know
[42:37] and i think of how that the day and time
[42:39] we live in things have been made
[42:40] easier amen to access today than any
[42:43] other day you think about you
[42:45] you go to the grocery store you go to a
[42:47] maybe go to a flea market and you want
[42:49] to buy something and years ago he had to
[42:51] go home and find a magazine and flip
[42:52] through the magazine and find the price
[42:54] 20 years ago and then
[42:55] then come back try to talk the guy down
[42:57] amen but now you carry a cell phone in
[42:59] your pocket that you just pull out in a
[43:01] matter of time
[43:02] and then you can access the price of
[43:04] that all over the world so we're living
[43:05] in a day and time
[43:06] amen where things have been made easier
[43:08] to access we've often heard it said
[43:10] amen that our young people have access
[43:12] to more sin
[43:14] and ungodliness than any generation
[43:16] before amen and i'll say that that is
[43:18] true amen 20 years ago
[43:20] amen if they wanted to access something
[43:21] of the world they had to go to a
[43:22] bookstore go to a movie hall
[43:24] amen but now carry it in their pockets
[43:26] and in their laptops amen
[43:28] it's a day when things have been made
[43:29] easier to access and i'll say it like
[43:31] this
[43:32] amen the advancement of technology has
[43:34] made it easier to access these things
[43:36] now
[43:36] amen i'll just say i'm not a negative
[43:38] person amen i don't like to leave
[43:39] everything
[43:40] on the negative side but i'd like to
[43:42] bring it to the positive side
[43:44] amen to say that if they have more
[43:45] access to the negative to the
[43:47] ungodliness to this and
[43:48] to the unrighteousness then let me say
[43:50] we have more access to more word
[43:53] amen in this generation that has ever
[43:54] been given before we're
[43:56] we're not here accessing a partial word
[43:58] we're not here talking
[43:59] amen about a partial opening of the word
[44:01] but we have been given access in this
[44:03] generation
[44:04] amen not to the partial word amen but to
[44:06] the full word think about that tonight
[44:08] in the house of god
[44:09] amen we're not reading from a closed
[44:11] book and then we're not lead
[44:13] we're not hearing from amen from a deaf
[44:15] god amen but we're talking to a living
[44:17] god
[44:17] amen that's got a living voice and
[44:19] behind that voice is an authority my
[44:22] amen to think tonight that we are his
[44:24] believing children
[44:25] amen and he has given his believing
[44:27] children the promise of
[44:28] access now how many will agree that the
[44:30] message is full of promises
[44:33] amen the message of the hour is full of
[44:35] promises it's full of healing
[44:37] full of deliverance full of miracles
[44:38] full of redemption that the
[44:40] the message of the hour is a message
[44:42] full of promises
[44:43] amen but i want to focus tonight on this
[44:45] promise the promise of
[44:47] access now you say what is the promise
[44:49] of access i'll say it this way
[44:51] the promise of access is all things that
[44:53] is in christ
[44:54] amen are yours and you have access to
[44:57] them isn't that easy
[44:58] amen all things that are in christ are
[45:01] yours
[45:01] amen and you have access to them and
[45:04] then sometimes i think we fail to
[45:05] realize what the message has provided to
[45:07] the church
[45:08] amen the prophet said the trouble with
[45:10] it today is they don't realize what is
[45:12] provided for them many people don't
[45:14] realize
[45:15] amen that the great glories and the
[45:17] powers that's been provided for them
[45:19] he said coming into jesus christ is like
[45:21] walking into an arcade down here
[45:23] amen are a great department store if
[45:24] somebody give me a great department
[45:26] store
[45:27] they said this is all yours amen this is
[45:29] all yours well the first thing i do
[45:31] amen is i'd walk around in there and
[45:33] find out what i owned
[45:35] amen what was mine and the way it is in
[45:37] christ when you become a christian
[45:39] he said walk around and find out what is
[45:41] yours amen and you own it all things
[45:44] are yours they've been given to you
[45:46] freely everything that christ died for
[45:48] is yours
[45:49] every one of them you've got a checkbook
[45:51] with jesus name signed
[45:53] amen across there and saying whatever
[45:54] you send this check to the father
[45:56] whatever you ask the father in my name
[45:58] that i'll do he said you're just scared
[46:00] to fill it out that's all
[46:02] amen but to think tonight church that
[46:04] the promises of god
[46:05] amen don't have to be something that we
[46:07] dream about amen they don't have to be
[46:09] something that we wish about or we hope
[46:11] about
[46:11] and then let me say this church is not a
[46:13] wishing well amen
[46:14] amen this is not somewhere we gather
[46:16] three times a week came in to throw a
[46:18] coin in the well
[46:19] amen and hope god will do something for
[46:21] the church amen but we are living in the
[46:23] hour where god himself
[46:24] amen has opened up the windows of heaven
[46:27] amen and is pouring out a blessing upon
[46:28] this generation
[46:30] amen if you're sick tonight amen you
[46:32] don't have to leave here sick
[46:33] amen if you're bound tonight you don't
[46:35] have to leave here
[46:36] amen if you're down you don't have to
[46:38] leave here now listen this is the
[46:40] beautiful thing about this message
[46:42] is you don't have to leave church the
[46:43] way you came and then you don't have to
[46:45] leave at the same to condemnation
[46:47] you don't have to leave with the same
[46:49] old spirit amen we have been given
[46:51] access by the power of almighty god let
[46:53] me say this the access to the things of
[46:55] christ
[46:56] amen does not come by education it does
[46:58] not come by intellectualism
[47:00] it does not come by feelings or human
[47:02] abilities amen
[47:03] or emotions it comes by the spirit
[47:07] amen it comes by the spirit now you say
[47:10] what spirit
[47:11] amen well there is only one spirit amen
[47:13] whereby we have access and that is the
[47:15] holy spirit
[47:16] and then for paul said there is one body
[47:18] there is one spirit
[47:20] even as you are called amen into one
[47:22] hope of your calling the prophet will
[47:24] say it like this
[47:25] let the spirit that may say the spirit
[47:27] amen let the spirit that dominated his
[47:30] body
[47:30] and his mind and controlled him and then
[47:33] come into us tonight
[47:35] and interpret the word and preach the
[47:37] word and give it to our hungry hearts
[47:39] amen as we wait on him now think about
[47:43] this tonight the spirit of god
[47:44] amen is superior to all other spirits
[47:47] amen there's a lot of spirits in the
[47:49] land today
[47:50] there's a spirit of intellectualism
[47:51] there's a spirit of formalism
[47:53] there's a spirit of just coming to
[47:55] church and being a casual christian
[47:57] amen just showing up and amen saying i'm
[47:59] here amen but the spirit of god tonight
[48:02] is superior to every one of those
[48:04] spirits amen there is no spirit that
[48:06] will stop the spirit of god
[48:08] amen the spirit of god will tear down
[48:10] walls he meant to gain access to his
[48:12] children
[48:13] amen if there was a hungry heart in here
[48:15] tonight amen desiring something from the
[48:17] word
[48:18] and there would be a thousand demons of
[48:20] unbelief that would surround this
[48:21] building
[48:22] amen if there was a pull in that heart
[48:24] amen god would push back every demon out
[48:26] of hell
[48:27] he would drive back every spirit of
[48:29] unbelief and he would come right down to
[48:31] your pew
[48:32] and would minister to you in the power
[48:34] and the fullness of this work
[48:35] listen church we're not a bunch of
[48:37] underprivileged children here tonight
[48:39] we are the sons and daughters of el
[48:40] salvador amen we are the sons and
[48:42] daughters of god
[48:44] who has been given a promise amen we
[48:46] don't have to sit on the outside and
[48:47] wish we could have revival
[48:49] amen we can have it tonight we ain't got
[48:51] to sit outside and wish somebody could
[48:53] get the holy ghost
[48:54] we can preach the holy ghost here
[48:55] tonight until the same holy ghost that
[48:58] filled the upper room
[48:59] and then would come in this building and
[49:01] would begin to fill vessels
[49:02] amen not with a bunch of mechanics and
[49:04] then but the same dynamics
[49:06] amen that filled the upper room can fill
[49:08] this church here tonight
[49:10] are you hearing me we're not a church
[49:12] amen looking for god to do something
[49:14] we're living in a day and time where god
[49:16] has done something
[49:18] and the spirit of god is not bound to
[49:21] these cold spirits
[49:22] amen the spirit of god is not bowed amen
[49:24] to these lukewarm devils
[49:26] the spirit of god will gain access amen
[49:29] to his children
[49:30] amen i was reading not long ago the
[49:32] prophet of god talking about saint
[49:33] patrick
[49:34] in the fatigue church age he said in one
[49:36] of his missionary journeys
[49:38] a minute as he approached the walled
[49:39] city he found the gates was barred
[49:42] against him
[49:43] he said he lifted his voice in prayer
[49:45] amen that god might intervene
[49:47] and allow him access amen to the people
[49:50] in order to preach
[49:52] think about this but as he prayed and
[49:54] then the court magicians began to harass
[49:57] him
[49:57] amen with loud noise but he began to
[50:00] sing a psalm
[50:01] and as he's saying amen god so increased
[50:04] the volume of his voice
[50:06] that he drowned out the cries of the
[50:08] heathen and suddenly somebody say
[50:10] suddenly and then suddenly the gates
[50:13] burst open
[50:14] on their own accord and he entered in
[50:16] and preached the gospel
[50:18] he meant winning many to the lord and
[50:20] then there was some seed in there
[50:22] and then there was some hungry hearts in
[50:24] there and there was some spirits around
[50:26] brother dave
[50:26] amen that was saying amen saint patrick
[50:29] you ain't coming in here
[50:30] amen but let the voices of the enemy say
[50:32] what they want to
[50:33] amen but what does it matter when the
[50:35] devil says amen when the king of kings
[50:38] is on our side
[50:39] hey word of life tabernacle amen let me
[50:41] remind you who's on your side tonight
[50:43] amen the same god of abraham and the god
[50:46] of isaac and the god of jacob

[50:50] and has manifested himself
[50:52] amen to give you access to the things of
[50:54] god listen church
[50:56] amen i hear the devil's voice amen but i
[50:58] want to tell the devil i can out praise
[51:00] him
[51:01] are you hearing me trying to set this
[51:04] meeting
[51:05] amen but i can't tell you this i can out
[51:08] sing
[51:08] and i may not be able to carry a tune in
[51:10] the bucket amen but when you begin to
[51:12] lift up please destroy
[51:14] god against your voice it begins to
[51:16] drown out the voice of your enemy
[51:18] oh church of the living god amen you
[51:20] want to break through in this church and
[51:22] then raise your voice one time
[51:23] amen and let the king of kings amen hear
[51:26] your praises
[51:27] and he'll come down in the middle of the
[51:29] church he'll fight your battles
[51:31] and then he'll make ways out of no ways
[51:33] he'll take the crooked streaks
[51:34] and make the highway straight he'll take
[51:37] the mountains and make him planes
[51:39] he's god and there's nothing he cannot
[51:41] do he's the same yesterday
[51:43] amen today and forever if you want it
[51:45] amen it's here for you
[51:47] and there ain't no devil got a right
[51:49] ain't meant to stand there and say you
[51:51] can't have it

[51:56] amen we're the
[51:57] we're the blood-bought sons and
[51:58] daughters of god amen can i take
[52:00] my a minute tonight and remind you who
[52:02] you are you ain't a slave
[52:04] you ain't a peasant you ain't a second
[52:06] class heaven citizen

[52:10] the living god
[52:11] amen your name is sealed in the lamb's
[52:14] book of life
[52:14] amen with the old blood of jesus christ
[52:17] and there
[52:18] ain't no devil i said there ain't no
[52:20] devil past

[52:27] church you are the sons and daughters of
[52:29] promise
[52:30] rise up generation and then rise up and
[52:33] possess
[52:33] what you have need of oh to think
[52:36] tonight
[52:37] amen our access to god is through the
[52:40] lamb
[52:40] somebody shout thank god for the lamb
[52:44] our access to god is through the lamb
[52:47] amen he was god's
[52:48] lamb he he was god's provided lamb amen
[52:51] provided for
[52:52] us amen that we sinners might have
[52:56] access amen to god through him amen
[52:59] think about
[53:00] this the time that we're living in is an
[53:02] odd time can you say amen
[53:04] it's a time when the prophet would say
[53:06] the greatest thing we can achieve is
[53:08] life
[53:09] at the same time he would say that
[53:11] people are so dissatisfied with life
[53:13] that they are trying to end their life
[53:15] now you see what you see why that is is
[53:18] because there's two types of life
[53:20] and then there's a natural life and then
[53:22] there is a spiritual life
[53:24] or an eternal life amen see how does the
[53:26] natural life come
[53:28] amen the natural life comes amen through
[53:30] the sexual blood
[53:31] amen through that sex of blood amen
[53:34] comes to comes the passing down of genes
[53:36] and then there can be high blood
[53:38] pressure genes amen it can be
[53:40] it can be it can be tempers in those
[53:41] genes and then there's all kinds of
[53:43] things
[53:44] that can be rest him in the genes of
[53:46] that sexual blood
[53:47] amen that was passed down to you amen
[53:50] but my bible says
[53:51] if in this life only we have hope in
[53:54] christ
[53:54] we are of all men most miserable amen
[53:57] see tonight
[53:58] if all we have is just the hope that
[54:00] someday
[54:01] we're going to receive eternal life then
[54:03] that tells me i cannot preach tonight
[54:06] that you can be the victorious church
[54:09] you say what are you talking about if
[54:11] i've got to stand here tonight
[54:12] and say someday we'll have eternal life
[54:15] and someday we'll have the holy ghost
[54:17] and someday our sins will be forgiven
[54:19] and someday the curses
[54:20] have been that have followed you since
[54:22] you as a child amen will be broken
[54:24] someday
[54:25] then there's no authority in this
[54:26] service tonight amen but when i can
[54:28] stand here and say
[54:29] amen that we have been given more than a
[54:31] sexual blood we have been given the
[54:33] perfect blood
[54:34] of the almighty god amen then i can tell
[54:37] you what the prophet
[54:38] said he said when you're born again amen
[54:40] the life of that blood comes on the
[54:42] inside of you
[54:43] he said and it's through his holy blood
[54:45] that we have access to life
[54:48] and our sexual blood is dismissed preach
[54:52] preacher thank you i believe i will
[54:54] our sexual blood is dismissed and we
[54:57] have the blood of jesus christ
[54:59] that stands for an atonement amen making
[55:02] an
[55:02] atonement for our sins and then see
[55:06] tonight
[55:06] amen how many's heard the promises
[55:08] preached amen and you wanted to possess
[55:10] them
[55:11] amen you wanted to possess that promise
[55:13] of joy you wanted that promise of peace
[55:15] you wanted that promise amen where he
[55:17] said i'll give you a peace
[55:19] amen that'll pass all understand it and
[55:21] something inside of you said raise up
[55:23] and get it
[55:24] amen but the devil raised up and said
[55:26] but you cannot get it
[55:27] amen because your mom had done this and
[55:29] your daddy done this
[55:31] and your grandpa was this amen and you
[55:33] made this mistake
[55:34] amen but i didn't come tonight amen to
[55:36] bargain with the devil
[55:38] amen i come to tell the devil what the
[55:39] prophet said he said tonight
[55:41] amen by the blood of almighty god amen
[55:44] the sexual blood is dismissed
[55:46] and there is an atonement in the
[55:48] presence of god
[55:49] for every recipient of the blessings of
[55:51] god come on church
[55:53] you ain't gonna stay on the outside the
[55:55] night like a kid at the candy store
[55:57] and wish you could go in and get it

[56:00] that has been provided tonight that you
[56:02] can raise up

[56:22] possess it

[1:14:44] number
[1:14:46] to tell me i'm putting too much emphasis
[1:14:48] on the message is to say i'm putting too
[1:14:50] much emphasis on christ
[1:14:52] amen this message is not a way to the
[1:14:54] rapture this message is not a better
[1:14:56] fault

[1:15:30] amen what do i do if there's a question
[1:15:33] there's got to be an answer
[1:15:35] remember nicodemus when jesus said man
[1:15:38] must be born again
[1:15:39] he'd give him direct instructions
[1:15:42] and nicodemus brother david turned
[1:15:44] around and asked a direct question
[1:15:47] he said how can me being an old man
[1:15:50] return into my mother's womb for the
[1:15:52] second time
[1:15:53] amen and jesus said i'm not talking
[1:15:55] about that birth
[1:15:56] i'm talking about the birth it comes
[1:15:58] from the water
[1:15:59] amen the blood and the spirit i'm
[1:16:02] talking about nicodemus
[1:16:04] the reason you're in this condition is
[1:16:05] because of the sex of blood
[1:16:07] amen that come through the fall in the
[1:16:08] garden but i have got a blood here
[1:16:10] present tonight
[1:16:11] nicodemus it will set you free
[1:16:14] [Music]
[1:16:15] nicodemus said how can these things be
[1:16:18] said nicodemus asked the question amen
[1:16:20] how can i be born again
[1:16:22] i'm an old man enter in my mother's womb
[1:16:24] the second time he said except the man
[1:16:26] be born again
[1:16:27] he cannot see the kingdom of god that
[1:16:29] word is really understand
[1:16:31] the kingdom of god the kingdom of god
[1:16:34] is within you so you couldn't actually
[1:16:39] see it unless you see it operating
[1:16:42] i ain't got time to preach there but the
[1:16:44] only way you'll ever be able to
[1:16:46] understand
[1:16:47] is if you got born again and to be born
[1:16:49] again
[1:16:50] you've been filled with god's spirit
[1:16:52] then you're in christ
[1:16:53] and when you're in christ the holy
[1:16:56] spirit has broken
[1:16:58] oh jesus when you're in christ
[1:17:02] and the holy spirit is in you amen then
[1:17:05] the holy spirit that wrote the bible
[1:17:07] amen that manifested christ is in you
[1:17:11] to recognize his own self
[1:17:16] a mouthful amen if you got the holy
[1:17:18] ghost okay come on brother

[1:17:27] me

[1:17:33] this scripture is fulfilled
[1:17:35] he said this verse is talking about me
[1:17:38] you know how he could say that
[1:17:39] is because the same holy ghost amen that
[1:17:42] fell upon isaiah to write it
[1:17:44] was the same holy ghost that descended
[1:17:46] on the river jordan
[1:17:47] and filled that man called jesus's body
[1:17:50] and he went in the temple
[1:17:51] and he picked up the word and he said
[1:17:53] this is me and then he found the place
[1:17:56] that was written
[1:17:56] not about peter not about bartholomew

[1:35:54] see issues come up and we say well you
[1:35:55] know
[1:35:56] what the answer is christ just left the
[1:35:58] church
[1:36:00] he's no longer in the church the prophet
[1:36:02] said well that's where they stay with
[1:36:03] people who call themselves christians
[1:36:04] oh i belong to church that's good but
[1:36:06] you see the reason there's so much
[1:36:08] trouble in the church
[1:36:09] in so much confusion and discontentment
[1:36:11] is because that gee
[1:36:12] it's not because jesus isn't there it's
[1:36:15] because he can't gain
[1:36:17] access to the places
[1:36:20] he wants to go
[1:36:28] jesus ain't left this church jesus ain't
[1:36:31] left this message
[1:36:34] jesus has not left this bride's revival
[1:36:38] hallelujah thank you jesus
[1:36:41] it's because jesus can't gain access
[1:36:44] access
[1:36:46] in the places he wants to go
[1:36:51] we have those little compartments and we
[1:36:54] say oh no don't touch that
