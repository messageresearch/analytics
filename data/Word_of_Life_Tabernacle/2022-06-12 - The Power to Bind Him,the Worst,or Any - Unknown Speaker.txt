it and we pray that you'd come and you take over this service lord we'll give you the praise and the glory and the honor in jesus name amen amen let's turn to matthew chapter 16 and verse 13 this morning matthew 16 and 13 good to have you with us on a sunday morning god bless you each and every one for showing up i several still gone but one of these days you know that's just the way it is in the summer isn't it and it's a good time to get out of town but it's a good time to be in the house of the lord too isn't it hey man good night jeremy up here on the front row and uh always good to see people on the front row but joel's been up here setting a standard on the front row either that or he doesn't want to sit by his wife so we're not sure exactly which but but it's good to have people up front matthew 16 and 13 when jesus came into the coast of caesarea philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do men say i the son of man am it matters what you say about him what you believe about him they said some say that thou art john the baptist some elias and others jeremias are one of the prophets he saith unto them but whom say ye that i am and simon peter answered and said thou art the christ the son of the living god and jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven and i say also unto thee that thou art peter and upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it i will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven i pray the lord would add his blessing to the word you may be seated i want to speak to you this morning on power to bind him the worst or any power to bind him the worst or any i had mentioned to you about the message paradox that i've been listening to the one that brother branham preached in december of 1961 he relates at the beginning of that sermon a uh a story or or a vision that he had had and he said it was about three o'clock in the morning he said i'd gotten up and i looked in front of me and looked like i was standing on the map of palestine i was coming down to the jordan i watch he's standing on a map so you know it has a spiritual significance he said i was coming down to the jordan he said and as i drew near the river i looked back and seen which way i had come and i was two-thirds of the way there to the jordan he said and i looked across jordan and i said oh praise god just on the other side is where all the promises lay every promise lays in the promised land now remember this is december of 1961. now i want you to to notice today and i want to make this statement right now that i believe we're living in the land today where all the promises lay we're not two-thirds of the way there and you know that he had had the first pull of his ministry the second pull of his ministry but it would be the third poll that brought him all the way into the promised land and and so he said that's where every promise lays and so understanding the opening of the word and what god has done for us in this day isn't just some abstract theology but it's actually knowing that god has made himself present in our day and he's actually brought every promise to become a reality to us that we don't have to fear anything right we don't have to fear any spirit we don't have to fear any any any theology we don't have to fear any idea of man but we we have a god who is able to overcome everything that comes our way how many believe that this morning greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world your our god is able and what does the third pole do what does the opening of the word do we use those terms we've come all the way into the promised land right do you believe that this morning amen now the word is amen in case you've forgotten it amen and so brother branham said then when i come into the vision again so he comes back into the vision he said it seemed that i was lifted up and sitting on a narrow highway with some brother i never knew who the brother was i looked around and seemed like everybody was afraid i said what's everybody so afraid of and a voice came and said there is such danger in these days how many could say amen to that this morning there's such danger in these days you have to be careful because death is all around us yet it doesn't have to affect us but it is out there and i'm talking now with spiritual death it's everywhere death is everywhere you've got to be careful there's such danger in these days there's a great hideous thing that's death when it strikes you he said and i heard the weeds mashing down and i looked and here come a huge monster snake crawling through the weeds that's not a vision that's a nightmare a huge monster snake i i don't think there's such a thing as a good snake my son tells me that there is and he's always trying to pick him up by the tail and and tells us so there's certain ones we should leave in the yard and my wife and i agree we've come to an agreement that that there's no such thing as a good snake in our yard so we do everything we can to keep them out but but when you look at that and begin to you realize that this was something that was represented something it represented death he said i thought now knowing this is vision he said i'll see what this animal or this beast is he said he crawled up on the highway and as soon as i got sight of him i knew it was a mamba now he said a mamba is an african snake which is the most deadly bite of all things there is there's nothing as poison as a mamba and the snake of course represents sin and death so what did god show him brother branham having been in africa knowing what the worst snake was the worst land snake in the world is the mamba if it bites you you'll only live for a few minutes and so he shows him the very worst that there was and and says this is what's out there stalking the highway right and this represents sin and death he said and here he was on the highway i thought well this is it so i looked at him and he looked angry at me and he licked his tongue and here he come he said but when he got right close to me he said he would run up fast and then he would get slower and slower and just quiver and stop and then something would hold him off he couldn't bite me he said and he would turn around on the other side try to approach from this side he would get back and get a start and swish right towards me get slower and slower and slower and then to a stop he said then he would shake like that and move back he couldn't strike me he said then he turned and looked at my friend and away he went after my friend and this is always the way the devil does by the way if he can't get you he'll try to get those around you he said he he turned and looked at my friend the way he went after my friend i seen my friend just jumping away in the air over him and over him and over him trying and the thing was tracking at him i must have scared the poor man to death he said i thought oh if it ever hits him it'll be instant death he said no wonder everybody is so scared he said and i threw my hands up and i said oh god have mercy on my brother and just then the serpent turned to me when i said that and looked at me again and a voice came from above me and said you have been given power to bind him the worst right this is the worst snake this is as bad as it gets huh oh i hope you hear me this morning it's the worst thing that you could possibly face in the wild as far as a snake the worst snake that there was he said but you've been given power to bind him yes the worst or any right amen and i said well god what must i do he said there's one thing you must do you must be more sincere i said well god forgive me for my insincerity let me have sincerity when i raised up my hands to him again there was a great something came over me just lifted me up seemed like that my whole body was charged with something and i looked at the serpent and then he started towards me and he couldn't do it yet and i said satan in the name of the lord jesus christ i bind you and the serpent a blue smoke flew out of him he curled up he said made that sign like a capital s made backwards and and a sign an and signed he said and means buying this one oh i love this or anything below him behind this one or anything below him because he was the worst he said blue smoke fell out of him his tail choked his own self to death around his head and the brother was free and just then a voice came again and said you can unbind him also so i said then satan that i might know i unbind you and when it did he started coming to life again wiggling and i said i bind you back in the name of jesus christ when it did the smoke flew out of him again he choked himself right back again and turned to crystal he said then when he did that that voice said now you must be more sincere than what you are to do this he said then it left me and i was standing in the room now i want us to kind of lay that there as a foundation and go on now brother branham continues to preach on a paradox and what it was he said it was incredible but true it's the same thing as a miracle he said it's incredible but it actually is a fact he said later and later in the message he goes back and he ties this vision to our text with which is matthew 16 19 when jesus says who do you say that i am and he said thou art the christ the son of the living god so and then he says you've been you if the things that you bind on earth will be bound in heaven whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven and brother branham said oh he said that's what the vision was now so jesus says that again in matthew 18 and 18 he said verily i say unto you whatsoever you shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever you shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven and verse 19 again i say unto you that if two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything that they shall ask it shall be done for them of my father which is in heaven do we really believe that this morning do we really believe it now look he said it shall be done for them for where two or three are gathered together in my name there am i in the midst of them as we've talked about recently now this scripture was manifested literally now think about it in the upper room because the bible tells us we've been over that as well recently the bible tells us that they were all with one accord in one place there were two or three gathered together they were there in his name and they were agreeing together they were in one accord as to what should be done so they were there in the upper room and this scripture literally come to pass that the holy spirit fell and now remember what jesus told him he said i'm going to give you the keys plural to the kingdom giving you the keys to the kingdom so peter takes one of those keys and he has the key and what a key is is a key unlocks a mystery a key unlocks a mystery there's a mystery behind the door and when you unlock the door then it's revealed to you what's inside the room right if your house was locked and i'd never been in it if you had the key to it you unlocked the door and then when you walk in you're able to see all the things that are on the inside and so peter has the keys to the kingdom so now watch what happens here the holy ghost fell in acts 2 37 and peter has preached his sermon it says now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said to peter and to the rest of the apostles men and brethren what shall we do and peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost what was he doing he was using the key to unlock the door for these people he was unbinding now think about he said i've given you the power to bind the worst or to unbind it the power to bind the worst or any now here is simon peter taking the keys and using his scriptural authority to unbind it he's brother branham said it this way he said now they said men and brethren what can we do he said that's the question and he said how are we going to get it who's got the keys come here simon you got the keys pull them off your side oh my you believe we still have the keys today still have those same keys right we can tell somebody say well how can i be saved repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ that key still works right it's still the same so now he said who's got the keys come here simon you've got the keys pull them off your side what are you going to say now remember jesus christ said if you bind it on earth i'll bind it in heaven if you loose it on earth i'll loose it in heaven and if he's god you believe he's god this morning he has to keep his word so brother branham is talking to the catholic priest because a catholic priest is uh they believe the catholics believe that god gave the church the power to forgive sins and that's why you confess to the priest and he will forgive you of your sins i want to tell you this morning i can't do that for you right you could confess your sins to me it wouldn't do you any good as far as other than just let somebody know maybe make you feel better but it wouldn't i couldn't absolve you of those sins i can't do that but if you confess them to god right he's the one who forgives sins there's one mediator between god and man the man christ jesus but now here the the catholics believe because that peter was given the keys that they have the ability to do that brother branham dealt with it this way he said the catholic said didn't christ give his church which which we or his church the power to forgive sins on earth he said he certainly did i said now if you'll forgive them the same way that they forgive them or go with you i said how'd they forgive them did they tell them go do a novena or something or the way you do see the key it doesn't change right if you're going to unbind if you're going to open that door you can't change the way that you get in the way is still by repentance and baptism yes right and receiving the holy ghost that's still the way in right yeah that doesn't change he said he said no sir peter said repent he said there's the key repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sins then you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost he said the key went click on earth and went click in heaven now we can say anything right but if we're using the key now what was the key was to unlock the mystery of matthew 28 19 to unlock the mystery of uh of baptize them in the name of the father son and holy ghost right that's a mystery right it was placed there to bind yes right but he said i've given you power to bind and to lose the worst or any so now it was placed there to bind and that's why many people today are confused by that it was put there for the purpose of that but yet peter had the key to it and he said repent and be baptized every one of you he said why would god do that because we must seek god by faith there's got to be a revelation that comes to you not just anybody can come and and and see the things that you see but there's got to be something down on the inside of you we call it a seed of god something eternal inside of you that there's something there that responds when when that key when that door is unlocked you say that's it so there's got to be a key that you have to be able to have revelation to see what the word is now now again matthew 16 19 he said i will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven now he said keys and these were given to peter and we believe we still have these today now we know that god does nothing without a man brother adam said peter was given the key to the kingdom and said whatever you bind on earth i'll bind it in heaven what does the key do it unlocks something the mystery and when jesus said go baptize them in the name of the father son and holy go sitting there he said setting that there to blind the unbeliever he said well god can't do that why not he's god god does what he wants right but there's a purpose in it now there were some mysteries that were hidden in the scripture and i'm not going to go back into all of this today because you understand this but just to kind of give you an idea where i'm going today there are some mysteries hidden in the scripture and daniel talks about it revelation talks about it in revelation 10 7 says in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished so we'd say it like this that the doors will all be unlocked the the key will finally unlock the door the the church at that time will have the keys the seventh angel if we could be more particular we'll have the keys to unlock the door to the entire mystery of god now we know that some had different keys at different times luther had a key to unlock justification wesley had the key to unlock sanctification the pentecostals had a key to unlock the restoration of the gifts right they understood that when others didn't but here comes the seventh angel with the key to unlock all the mysteries of god right to go all the way across to jordan to go into where the promises of god are the key to do that the power to bind and to unbind not just a part of the scriptures but all of the scriptures you realize where we live this morning we don't live under a partial realization we don't live under a thing where where we have an excuse we don't have an excuse anymore for how we live and what we do we've been given power to become sons and daughters of god we've been given authority to to take hold of the keys and unlock the mysteries of god we've been given the revelation that we have need of it's all here for us we're not looking for someone to go that last step into the promised land but a prophet of god walked into it unlocked it for us and we're standing on the shoulders of a prophet of god today and we have access to healing we have access to salvation we have access to the word of god are you are you with me today we've got access to whatever we have need of so that removes all excuses he said brother man well i just can't seem to live it i just can't seem to be happy i just can't seem to i just can't seem to take advantage of the promise of joy i just can't seem to take advantage of the promise of peace i just can't seem to take advantage of the promise of healing well why is that it's not it's not god's fault because this is the land of the promises this is the land where the promises lay you're living in it the mystery of god is finished the door is unlocked before that time those people did not know how to be saved men and brethren what shall we do but when peter unlocked the door come on yeah oh my that's what this message did to us are you hearing me this morning oh my excuse me i've been a little low on breath all week but we're getting there now the bible says so so now we we found the seventh angel then has the key to unlock the hidden mystery of the entire bible the bible says this in first corinthians 15 25 it says he must reign christ must reign until he has put all enemies someone say all enemies he must reign he must exercise his power tilleth put all enemies under his feet he said in the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death this is the worst now and what i've said so far i just want you to remember that as we continue going and put on your thinking caps because it'll be important as we go along so he said the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death behold i show you a mystery click right they didn't know this behold i show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed for this corruptible must put on incorruption this mortal must put on immortality so when this corruptable shall have put on incorruption and this mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that his written death is swallowed up in victory so now now but he watch what he told him he said i show you a mystery paul had a key to unlock that portion of it that could be understood in their day but there's a portion of that rapture mystery that was left for this day how many understand that brother branham taught us that this mystery of going must be revealed by the seventh angel's message he said but to the church the bride the rapture is a revelation to her it's revealed to her how many believe you're the bride tonight this morning you believe you're the bride if you're the bride of jesus christ then the rapture is a revelation to you he said brother ben that's that's beyond my understanding he didn't say that it was an understanding to you or knowledge to you yeah he said it was revelation to you it's revelation to you you get to walk into it you've got the key to it you've been handed the key to the rapture oh my he said but that's a door that's locked and that's where so many people stop because they see a door that's locked and they say well i can never be a real christian because that that's locked to me i i can't be like all these other people i i just wouldn't it wouldn't be right i i can't live like that i can't do like that i can't receive my healing that's a door that's locked to me you've been given the keys by the message of the hour and what i want to lift up to you this morning and try to get you to understand is that the keys oh god it was peter who had the key they could stand there and quote matthew 28 19 all they wanted to but they had to get the key to it and it's this message it gives us the key to the entire bible then what should we be doing we should be getting into the message of the hour we should be preaching the message of the hour we should be reading the message of the hour because that's the key he gave us the key to the rapture the rapture was the door and the and the church age walked up to it and said we can't go in yeah and god said here's the revelation of it yes right he said well that's hard for me to understand no it's you just have to believe it the key to it is in the seventh angel's message not my message why do we do what we do why do we try to spread this message around the world why do we try to tell people why do we witness about it i think some people have gotten ashamed of it and that's a shame this message is christ this message is not a cult it's not a following it's not a man it's key to unlock the rapture i mean you want to go how many want to go today you're getting tired of this world getting tired of the things going on getting tired of of all the things in politics getting tired of the economy get down i want to go how we going to go by this message that's what gives us the key amen where we can walk up to the door confidently walk up to the door and say here i am i'm ready to go home we can dress ourselves in the message of the hour see that the door has to be unlocked for us to go through but the braham said the rapture is a revelation to her it's revealed to her that the revelation the true bride of christ will be waiting for that revelation of the rapture he said now it is a revelation for the revelation is faith you cannot have a revelation without it being faith he said faith is a revelation because it's something that's revealed to you he said faith is something that's been revealed to you like it was to abraham that could call anything contrary listen to what had been revealed to him so it wasn't so right so we have a message that's been revealed we have a message and and and faith in this hour call anything contrary to the message of the hours though it wasn't so right and and i'm not telling you to go away say well you take things that are outside of the bible no the message of the hour is the scriptures for our day you understand that the word it's the word made flesh and manifest and and opened up to us in our day it won't be anything outside of the book it can't be it's got to be within it and so but it's just the unlocking of it so that we can see what's on the inside so it's something that's revealed to us like abraham so we look at that and we say well anything contrary to that the world says you've got to do this you've got to do that the world says this is how you should raise your families the world said this is how you should treat your wife the world said this is how you should treat your husband but the message of the hour says yes are you with me now it matters what the message says because the message of the hour is the unlocking of the key hey man now look and it's not just big mysteries our everyday life but so now when we see something it's contrary to it so your body tells you he says you're going to die and you're going to stay dead and and you're never going there's never going there's no hope for you there's no resurrection maybe your spirit tells you oh you've done too many bad things you've you've entered but what did the message tell you yeah what did the message tell the message said you're going to be raised with him you've already been quickened with him the message said that your sins were put in the sea of forgetfulness right that's what the message of the hour said that's what the word this word for our day it's literally just that part of this word that portion for our day the word of the hour is just god coming down and through a prophet manifesting and showing and revealing to us the things that we would need for our time there were certain things that were given for breakfast certain things that were given for dinner or lunch and certain things that were given for supper what was it this is the evening time this was time for a full seven course meal so at this time the holy ghost dispensed through a prophet the things that we would need to eat amen to be able to go home now brother brown said the church he said is built upon a revelation the whole entire body again brother branham says this he said i believe that through these seven thunders through those seven thunders will be revealed in the last days in order to get the bride together for rapturing faith he said because what we got right now we wouldn't be able to do it he said there is something we've got to step further he said we can't have enough faith for divine healing hardly we've got to have enough faith to be changed in a moment and be swept out of this earth you realize the challenge of this hour is higher than the challenge of the pentecostal age because the challenge of the pentecostal age was just to reproduce the gifts again in the church but this is to do that and more this is to go beyond that and to go all the way back to eden again brother branham calls it another ephesians a second ephesians we're going to get to it in just a moment because we're going to come full circle back to the message paradox because brother branham talks about joshua standing there and saying son stand still and that's what we're coming back to is another ephesians he said we've got to step farther we've got to have faith to be changed in a moment it's a higher calling than just having faith for a headache but it's to be changed in a moment and twinkling of an eye but but i wanted to kind of talk to you and this is what was inspired to me this week is you know if it's the worst if the worst if you can believe for the worst and i know some of you have real faith that you're going to go in a rapture yeah well maybe more less than i thought but some of you have real faith i'm going to make it if there's going to be one brother danny it's going to be me real faith but then you turn around you get a headache there's not enough money in the bank or you have trouble at work that's right so well i guess i got to figure this out on my own you believe god's gonna change your body yes sir that's right that's a big deal right he's gonna turn me back that's a paradox i can't explain that that's the worst he's going to unbind the greatest mystery he's going to unbind the mystery of a new body he's going to give me the revelation of a rapture he's given that to me i believe it by faith i believe it then why can't i believe him on monday why can't i believe him on tuesday why can't i believe him when i'm sick why can't i believe him when i come to church are you with me why can't i believe him when i'm on the job why can't i believe him for my children right he's bound the worst snake that there was and if the mamba was bound every little copperhead that comes up against you you've got a right to bind that every little black sect that comes by your way you've got a right if the worst has been bound you've got a right to bind any yeah right are you with me this morning amen so these seven seals now he said these thunders have to come for rapturing faith but then he says this later he said it's all revealed in there amen and the seven seals opened up the revelation of what that was that's what it was he said see it's still in the word you can't get out of the word it won't leave the word god's spirit will never leave the word it'll stay right with the word blinding some and open the eyes of others what are the power to bind and unbind now watch the mysteries have been revealed how many believe that this morning so the mystery is the lock or the door the revelation is the key and we have the revelation listen if this message has delivered us from spiritual death yes we underestimate the power of that you think about it think about what you were think about what you could be today but jeremy could think about that some of the rest of you i think most of us could look at that and say i can look and see where i could be i can look at my cousins i can look at my some of my family members and think what what i could be and this message gave me a key all right it unlocked something the new birth by the by the process of the new birth it wasn't just the letter of the message but the spirit of it the new birth come and when it did it unlocked to me a key and now i can look at and say i'm not what i could have been i've been saved from spiritual death so it's just like in in egypt when uh the passover was going uh when the when the death angel was going everywhere and they were standing there under the token under the blood and they could look out and see others who were dying other families that were losing their firstborn and the father of the house could stand there like i'm standing today and say it hasn't touched my house how many could say amen to that today it hasn't touched my house why is spiritual death not touched my house because i have the key they had the key in that hour was that on the doorpost i have the key to the message of the hour told me you must have the token on display right and so that's the key to saving us from spiritual death but if this message has delivered us from spiritual death and will deliver us from natural death if it binds the worst if the mamba has been bound if the promised land is all around us what about these little things you say well if i could just figure them out just bind them you have the power how do i do that by the word just just feed on the word now look the voice told brother branham you must be more sincere i want us to go to joshua chapter one joshua chapter one and verse one it says now after the death of moses the servant of the lord it came to pass that the lord speaking to joshua the son of none moses minister is saying moses my servant is dead now therefore our eyes go over this jordan thou and all this people to the land which i do give to them even to the children of israel every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that have i given unto you as i said unto moses he said you need to cross on in this is the land where the promises are he said i've given it unto you from the wilderness then this lebanon even unto the great river the river euphrates all the land of the hittites and to the great sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your coast there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as i was with moses so i will be with thee i will not fail thee nor forsake thee be strong and of good courage for unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land which i swear unto their fathers to give them only be thou strong and very courageous what's he doing he's speaking to him now he shows him this is what you're going to do this is what you're supposed to do go into the land you're supposed to go all the way in be strong be courageous now think about it like this be sincere be sincere be strong be courageous be sincere that's what sincerity is is being strong and courageous about the word i hope you're hearing me now it's not just being sincere and just in general because you can be sincerely wrong but it's being strong and courageous about the word that's true sincerity so he's reminding joshua you need to be more sincere you need to be very strong you're strong joshua be stronger your courageous joshua be more courageous because it's going to take that to enter into this land see this land ate for sissies i hope you hear me this morning this land ain't for sissies this land ain't for halfway christians right this land ain't for people who don't know whether they're in or out this land is difficult this land is o landed for warriors this land is a land with giants in it this land is a land of grapes but it's also a land of giants this land is a land this is a land of beautiful fields that you can plant but it's also a land of walled cities that have to be shaken down if you're gonna walk into it it's a good land it's the land where the promises are but he said you need to be more sincere to enter into this land you need to have you need to get really down to business with god and if i could make a call this morning that would be my call to myself and to each one of us individually you need to be more sincere if you're going into this land you need to start caring about the house of god you need to start caring about the things of god you need to start really digging down into the word of god listen to the message of the hour be more sincere be strong and courageous don't be afraid because this is a good land listen what he says he said be strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do be sincere about it according to all the law which moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou goest this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but thou shalt meditate therein day and night you want to know how to take the land how many are interested in taking the land this morning i'm interested in taking the land i've got an interest in going all the way in because that's where the body change is on the other side of that river that's where the body change is that's where the that's where the promises are i have an interest in taking the land and i believe we're in the land today but we still have to take it for ourselves whatever has been allotted to us we still have to walk on it we still have to walk on it how we gonna walk on it this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth thou shalt meditate there in day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that has written therein for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous then thou shalt have good success have not i commanded thee be strong and of a good courage be not afraid neither be thou dismayed for the lord thy god is with thee wheresoever thou goest joshua be more sincere now the angel told by the brandon brother brandon be more sincere you've got to be more sincere than what you are it's hard for me to even fathom almost you've had these great healing meetings god's spoken in your life you you fast and you pray and you touch the heart of god be more sincere because you're not just called to provide healing for the body you realize that was just a sign to attract the people that would just debate on the hook but we're not stopping with healing for the body we're going home so now he says joshua be more sincere now joshua as he gets into the land he gets into the battle of his life it wasn't easy but he said i'll be with you he said every everywhere you go i'll be with you and the enemy began to run and joshua's got him on the move in joshua chapter 10 we find that when he gets him on the move that he's almost out of time in the day so we need some more time oh god he needs some more time in the day to be able to route the enemy to be able to put him to complete flight so what does he what does he do now god's already told him i'll be with you you need to be more sincere be strong be courageous joshua 10 12 then spake joshua to the lord in the day when the lord delivered up the amorites before the children of israel and he said in the sight of israel sons stand thou still upon gibeon and thou moon in the valley of agilent now brother branham illustrated that and he said you know same earth stands still although that would be more logical but he didn't say earth standstill he said sun stands still because it's a paradox what that means is you can't explain it right we want to be able to explain everything but a paradox literally means you can't explain it yet it's true it's a paradox that you're saved today you can't explain it but it's true are you with me this morning i'll try not to hold you too long so the sun stood still he said sun stand still now moon in the valley of agile and the sun stood still the moon stayed until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies he said is this not written in the book of jasper so the sun stood still in the midst of heaven and hastened not to go down about a whole day there was no day like that before it or after it that the lord hearkened unto the voice of a man for the lord fought for israel but he said he would be there with them he said joshua i'm going to go with you why because he was living now in the land of promises he said joshua if you'll be sincere amen if you believe me if you'll walk into it if you'll go in if you'll fight he said you you'll be able to live in the land of promises and in the land of promises he said son stand still now brother branham said the same thing was in mark 11 23 if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe what you said will come to pass you can have what you said he said but you can't stand there and fumble in your mind and say it you've got to be inspired to say it and he goes on to the squirrels and hattie wright and begins to talk about that because that was brother branham's moment when he said you must be more sincere then brother branham comes to a time where he spoke those things into existence and and then had he write actually when he spoke hattie wright spoke and her own boys were saved and so that was the spoken word being manifested and that was the fulfillment of that now he's not two-thirds of the way in the land he's in the land that's where the promises are the spoken word are you with me this morning he said now he said that's mark 11 23 verily i say unto you whosoever shall say whosoever whosoever that means me right whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he saith he shall have whatsoever he saith brother brandon said notice when you have a need perhaps like joshua he had a need he never thought of the circumstances oh and that's what gets us in trouble so many times we begin to think about the circumstances we begin to dwell on the circumstances we begin to think about what why it can't be joshua didn't stand there and measure the distance from the sun to the earth he didn't stand there and think about well it's impossible for the sun to stand still he didn't think about it he was just inspired to say it he didn't sit there and and argue about it he didn't sit there and fuss about it but he just said son stand still because that's what he needed oh god and when brother branham needed squirrels which seems like an insignificant thing he just said speak and it'll be there there it was but the brother said when you have a need he had a need he never thought of the circumstances he spoke it and it was god he said do you believe the son stood still so do i how did it do it don't try to figure it out but it did it joshua did it and raised his hands in that crucial moment oh god i hope you realize today in your crucial moment when you get to the time when you really need it he said in that crucial moment he had access to god yes that's right but you got to be living in the land yes you don't live in the land when you get in the crucial moment oh let me cross over into jordan no you're already in the land right you're fighting you're there you've received the baptism of the holy ghost you're standing in the land you're believing the word you're you're feeding on the message of the hour you're assembling yourselves with believers you're in the land see when you don't do those things you're keeping yourself out you're you're standing on the other side of the jordan saying well well i never see my prayers answered no you need to be in the land and if you're in the land then don't look at the circumstances but look at the promise when you have a need in that crucial moment oh i wonder this morning maybe someone here is going through a time a crucial moment in their life he said in that crucial moment he had access to god and that's what happened it was timely he said the spirit oh my see you don't just see what you need in your life but god sees what you need that's what jesus told the disciples he said don't take any anxious thought about tomorrow he said doesn't god see what you need if god knows what the sparrow needs to live doesn't he see what you need what's bothering you this morning what's keeping you out of the economy of god you're sitting there and your mind's running about money or your mind's running about about your family about something else don't you realize this morning that that keep what's keeping out if you just step into the land in that crucial moment he would meet you there amen the spirit of the living god has seen the need of it and pushed upon joshua to say it the same god seeing the need of abraham the same god seeing the need of confirming he said this scripture to me this mark 11 23 confirmed it with the squirrels with hattie wright with his own wife the the different times i believe it was five times of the spoken word he said the same god seen the need of confirming this scripture to me that that scripture is true too he said the same god seeing the need of those two predestinated boys you have children out of the ark of safety god sees that need yes do you believe he sees it today then in the crucial moment you have access to god speaking amen and it'll be we either believe that or we don't oh my listen have you made the sun stand still oh god yeah if he delivered you from spiritual death you know god always gives you what you have neither if i found that if i would preach even if i was sick if i'd preach if i just do what i was supposed to do god would make a way somehow in the crucial moments they didn't know what to do that jesus said roll the stone away if they'd have walked away and said oh it just can't be done if mary and martha had walked away lazarus would have never raised but he said roll the stone away they couldn't raise lazarus but they could roll a stone are you hearing me they could roll a stone it might have been hard work but they had to do it somebody's got to roll the stone away somebody's got to preach the sermon somebody's got to listen to the sermon somebody's got to be in the house of god somebody's got to be a believer somebody's got to get into the word somebody it's got to be reading their bibles somebody's got to be speaking the word be more sincere somebody's got to fulfill that yes oh my somebody's got to do it let's let it let's let it be us this morning if he made the son stand still if he delivered you from spiritual death if the rapture is a revelation to you why can't you believe for the little things that you need this morning if if he if he took care of the worst thing the worst snake what about all these other little things you see this word places you in the promises of god ask what you will musicians go ahead and come ask what you will ask what you will are you struggling with with with things in your life are you struggling with sin with besetting sin are you struggling with with unbelief or you're struggling with the world and the things of the world are you struggling with doubt are you struggling with disappointments are you struggling with depression what are you struggling with if he's able to take care of death itself how much more is he able to bind the little serpents in your life and if he's able to unlock the mysteries of the age how much more is he able to give you the revelation that you have need of to make it through the next day to make it through the next hour well that's what we need i need to know how to go in a rapture sure but i need to know how to make it through today i need to know what to do i need to know how to act i need to know what position to be in so that i can be in the perfect will of god if he's able to take care of me in the worst moments of life and he's able to take care of me in the best moments of life would you bow your heads with me this morning excuse me for just pouring it in this morning not really taking time but i don't have a lot of breath today but i know that god's greater than my inability he's able to come and just let the word sink down into your heart what do you have need of if death itself has been destroyed been defeated then what about the little sickness what about the little the little financial problem what about the the inability so i just can't live it brother ben he's giving you power to live it we live in the land of promises what i would advise you to do is get out the tape player if you still have one get your phone get into the message of the hour read your bible feed on the word feed on the word that gives you strength you're in the land then you're you're walking in the land when you're walking in the land you begin to believe those promises you'll be just like joshua in that crucial moment you'll have access to god you believe that today amen heavenly father we thank you for this group of people that's gathered together today lord we've got one more service this afternoon lord i believe you've met us here this morning you're going to meet us once again i believe lord that you're the same yesterday today and forever i pray that the word would sink down into the hearts of each and every believer every person here in the divine presence this morning lord i know sometimes when people get nervous they begin to wonder well maybe i'm in the in the wrong place i i'm not in the will of god help them lord understand that the place they need to be in is in the land in the word i pray you grant that lord that's not a that's not a preacher it's not a certain church not this church or any other but it's your word lord i pray that we would be in that word or that we would be feeding on it every day lord and we would know that that word can give us strength like when israel was in egypt and they fed on the lamb and their lamb was roasted with fire and they fed on it when they fed on that lamb it gave them strength for their journey he told them he said eat all of it don't just eat part of it eat every bit of it because you're going to need the strength for the journey i pray that we would get that revelation today that the door would be unlocked to the message of the hour we'd begin to feed on the good things of god and we'd be ready when that moment comes to be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye but until that time all these other serpents or all these other other little snakes that have come up around us i pray you'd help us to understand we have power to bind each and every one we thank you for that thank you for your word today we love you and thank you for your presence that we feel now in jesus name amen amen let's as we just dwell on in a moment let's just sing this to him as he goes by you're fine he's
