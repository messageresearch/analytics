sisters [Music] foreign [Music] thank you musicians god bless you happy to be with you here friends i'm nervous first time that my in-laws actually could hear me preach so that i'll begin to wonder if they didn't like me but they showed up so but i sure do appreciate brother ben having enough faith to let me come back and preach to you all again i know you all pretty much know me and loving you and appreciate all you do for me and my family and i'm just going to go ahead and get into the word here for just a minute and like to pray right before we read if we just bow our hearts for just a second lord jesus father love you lord thank you god for another chance lord to be in your house god with your precious people lord god i thank you for those that went ahead and come out tonight lord that to support the word god knowing that i would be nervous lord but god they're not coming out to hear me lord they want to hear something from you father lord you just say anything lord just do it means so much more than i could ever do god lord this thought that's on my heart father i'm going to try to just do my best lord to move out of the way let you deliver this thought lord just commit it to you now in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen if you have your bibles i'd like to turn to first thessalonians i think i actually put the 11th first but i want to start with the 13th i didn't mean the 11th so let's go first thessalonians 4 13 and we'll start 13 and read all the way down just say man when you have your spots but i would not have you ignorant brethren concerning them which are asleep that you sorrow not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in jesus will god bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep but abraham said that was hinder for the lord himself shall descend with from heaven with a shout with a voice of the archangel with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord wherefore comfort one another with these words i'd say those pretty comforting words let's go to hebrews 12 and then we'll let you have your seats wherefore seeing we also arkham past was so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which does so easily beset us let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne of god may the lord has blessings you may be seated i thought those were two very encouraging scriptures first is a promise something that's fixing to happen one of these days and actually is happening even now you know brother branham said that the the message was the shout that went forth and christ does all three while he's descending so the rapture is actually taking place that word rapture you won't even find in the bible it's just a theology term actually it's a catching away so we know that the catching away process is actually started right now and then we also have this great cloud of witnesses that prove that it can be done those that have received the holy ghost that we're not those that could be alive and remain that they've had to take their arrest but they're going to come up in the rapture just the same as any of us and i just want to read it says in the days of jesus of nazareth when he was here on the earth walking in flesh he found the people in his day seeking a religion that would bring them deliverance and that's kind of what i'm talking about here is convinced that the message is the truth he said he found people in his day seeking a religion that would bring them deliverance they wanted a religion that would deliver them from all their evils their enemies and christianity met every challenge they asked for christianity met everything they needed it was everything that they asked for it challenged every one of their needs but they would not receive it he said it's about the same way today we find people today like them seeking for a religion that will do something for them that will bring some reality to them and real true christianity meets every one of those challenges but they won't receive it he says i'm not speaking to the born-again church he said i'm speaking to the nation country in whole they don't seem to want it he says if you want anything you just can't rest until you get it now i wanted to emphasize on that if you want anything you just can't rest till you get it born again christians there's something there's an elect seed of god inside of you that you're just not going to rest because you know the message of the hour is the truth jesus said in the beatitude he said blessed are those that hunger and thirst for righteousness for they shall be filled if they hunger and thirst but you've got to hunger and thirst first you've got to want it first you've got to want christ not just going to church you've got to want christ he says today we're trying to give people something that they really need and they don't want to accept it they just don't want he said the attitude of the people hasn't changed and yet that is exactly what the world needs today is the religion of jesus christ i believe we have the religion of jesus christ through the baptism of the holy ghost that is the message of this hour deliverance from things that are fearing and dreading they have need to be delivered of in the days when he was here on the earth one of the reasons why they would not receive jesus of nazareth and believe him and get their deliverance was because it was too unusual for them he brought his deliverance god sent them deliverance and it was so unusual to them that they didn't want to accept it because it didn't come the way they were used to receiving religion you know this word to the world is unusual you go to tell somebody about elijah about malachi 4 and 5 luke 17 30. you know revelations 10 7 they might say what are you talking about a prophet in this day but it happened and there is a people that's elected to receive the message people look at you and say why do you dress the way you do why do you talk the way you do why do you believe for things that might seem out of the ordinary divine healing and such you know some churches don't even believe in that but there's an elect seed that believes god it's more than just going to a church brother brahm says are we really getting people to god or are we just getting them to the church we got to get them to christ where there's quickening power it's good to go to church sure but that's as far as you go it's not far enough when you come to church that's good but go on to christ from the church because we must receive this quickening power that baptism of the holy ghost is quickening power it's a life change he said if we ever expect to be in that general resurrection because the only thing that will ever bring us up from the dead for if that spirit that raised up jesus from the dead will in you it will also quicken make bring to life your mortal bodies what a promise so there's a reason we've got to receive this quickening power because we've got to get people to christ because there's a battle going on and if you don't have that quickening power you're sure to lose the battle so that everybody says come be a christian everything will be all right no sir not for a christian all that god live godly in christ jesus shall suffer persecution you're going to be laughed at you're going to make be fun of you're going to be stomped at kicked out made fun of if they called the master of the house beelzebub how much more will they call them of his disciples he said but i'll take the way with the lord's justifies few i've started with jesus and i'm going through i think that's the attitude of the bride we don't care to be laughed at we don't care to be scoffed at i don't care if people think that believing for a rapture seems so unusual the things the way that we dress the way that our women keep their faces clean keep the hair long the men the way they act around other people they don't crack the worldly jokes they have a godly life is because the holy ghost is inside them we'll take the way with the lord's despised few he said if i could only look down tonight here in this city for the last three months where i've been across the nation see the falling of the way of the churches the indifference of the pastors see the indifference among the people who come out looks like fishes and loaves the first thing got enough temper to fight a buzzsaw so indifferent nasty pentecostal people ministerial association wants me to draw me out of the ring just because i let a man on the platform that wasn't baptized the way they thought ought to be baptized such indifference he said if i was looking right there i'd give up he said but i'm glad god got a hold of me before the church did i found out about god that's right found out about god was real i think that's so important we're not supposed to have indifferences between us we're not supposed to tear each other down we need god to get a hold of us before the church you know people say i've been hurt by this message this message never hurt nobody this message was sent to deliver you this message was to make you free it's people that's hurt other people it's fanaticism that's hurt other people it's criticism but the message has not hurt anybody this message is christ to deliver you it's people that's got their eyes on other people that's idolized other people and then it tears them down but we need to get a hold of christ we need the holy ghost in our lives you get the holy ghost in your lives you're not looking to other people you're looking to christ you're looking to his word we don't need the message church to get a hold of us we need to be the message in the church no matter how much fanaticism there is there is a genuine truth and there is a genuine believer he says i want to say this on behalf many people not we wouldn't understand divine healing or critics of it we do not claim to be divine healers now there's a lot of fanaticism hooked up with divine healing he said there's a lot of fanaticism hooked up with every phase of anything you do in your churches there's people that's real fanatics religious fanatics but that don't mean that god isn't real that doesn't mean that there isn't a real true christian it only vindicates that there is a real one if you had a bogus dollar it'd have to be real sure fact that there was a real dollar the dollar that it was made off of is that right if it isn't the bogus dollar would wouldn't be there wouldn't be a real dollar the counterfeit but being there is a counterfeit it only speaks that there is a real and when you see somebody acting or pretending to be a christian it only means there's a real christian somewhere when you see someone in the practice of divine healing made in some fanatical way it only speaks that there's a real article somewhere that it's coming from that's right a pro and con negative positive true false in all things all god's children are going to suffer persecution and you know all god's children have been called may have seemed crazy may have seemed fanatical but they had the correct balance of spirit and truth you got to have both of them you can't just have spirit without truth you can't just have truth without spirit you have truth without spirit you'll be starchy but if you have only spirit you may seem fanatical it takes a balance and that's why the holy ghost is needed to provide that balance what we need is b is like that little woman with the blood issue that wanted to touch jesus brother ram said there was a little woman on that hill and spent all of her money with the physicians no doubt the physicians had done all they knowed how to do to get that woman well probably hebrew physicians and that was a hebrew woman so they had done all that they could do for that sister although that nothing would stop the blood issue which perhaps he says could have been menopause he said but she'd get so weak she could hardly get around anymore she had heard about jesus and when she seen that little boat pushing to the willow she went down to find out now listen he says a lot of critics was standing there he's not free of critics today they had known who he was they would not have been his critics but they was his critics because they didn't know who he was and that's the way with the message today so many good men and women criticize it because they don't know what it is the only way they're going to know what it is is when they see a life lived they can listen and you can preach them all day long but they need to see a life live that someone can actually live this message and if that seed is inside them something will quicken one of these days we don't ever give up on them you keep pressing for them we're not here to tear them down you know brother branham speaks just there's three types there's the unbeliever mate believer and the real believer you know but i'm not going to throw stones at the mate believer the unbeliever my goal is to get that mate believer unbeliever into being a believer i want to see him go in a rapture i don't want to see him miss out but we know that there is going to be a deception brother branham said there would be he said it'd be so close the bible speaks that would deceive the very elect that wouldn't be denominations the dominations wouldn't deceive the elect but listen to what he says in the god of this evil age brother jason our home home church our pastor he's been kind of laying in on this he said last week in matthew 24 it was the most deceiving age of all ages all the ages of deceit from the garden of eden all the way down there's never been an age so deceptive as this age false prophets will rise and show signs and wonders if possible to deceive the very elected see now just a cold formal starchy church and so forth of man-made theology that wouldn't the elect would never pay no attention to that but it's up there almost like the real thing just leaving out one word is all you have to do promise of the age a very great time christians everywhere take heed in the hour that we're living you know the prophet god says when the supernatural is displayed it does produce the three types it produces the unbeliever the believer and the mate believer you look down and you think of the time of moses there was pharaoh the unbeliever i believe it was janice and jamborees who withstood moses that make believer that could produce signs maybe even wonders but they had no word but then there stood moses with the word and he said let my people go here we had a prophet and all everyone was trying to impersonate his gifts things like that but there was a genuine prophet that said world satan you've got to let my people go there is somebody going to make the rapture but what would cause an unbeliever or a mate believer i think it's a lack of reality if you had reality if you experienced christ then you wouldn't how could you be an unbeliever or a mate believer if you could ever get a hold of who he really is and be born again you'd have to be a believer the unbeliever would denounce the message the believer might try to use it to benefit them but the believer holds on for the promise because we didn't deserve it anyhow but god chose us anyway god says jesus said no man can serve two masters rather he will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to one and despise the other ye cannot serve god and mammon you can't hold on to two masters you've got to hold on to the lord jesus christ and i come across this quote you know speaking i'm not here to cast stones at the unbeliever the make-believer i want to get them being to be real believers brother jason a couple other ministers used it and i thought it was just powerful maybe the holy ghost was trying to tell some people things brother ram says now listen church i want to drop this in here because i believe the holy spirit told me to do it you may be sitting there some of you are i know you are disagreeing with me right now and i can call your name if you want me to talk about the eyes of a prophet i can call you out right now but listen to what he says he said i call your names you want me to so i know that but i can also see farther than that but you're going to believe it one of these days so i'm going to put this in so you understand so i can give you a little spot of grace it ain't going to be too long to some of you are going to change your mind you talk about grace talk about the holy ghost you might not believe it right now but one of these days you're going to catch it you're going to catch the vision because you're elected to catch it you can't help but catch it listen what paul says in colossians he says and you that were sometimes alienated enemies in your mind by wicked works he didn't say alienated in your soul he said by your mind you hadn't caught the revelation yet but one of these days you've got to catch it yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through the death to present you holy unblameable unreprovable in his sight if you continue in the faith grounded and settled and be not moved from the hope of the gospel which you have heard which was preached to every creature which whereof paul i am made a minister so look he's saying you're not enemies of god you were enemies in your mind at one time but then you heard a voice and it called you out and it changed your life and you received christ and now you're going a whole different role you know satan one thing he'll do to you if he can't keep you he'll try to make you jealous of somebody he'll try to lie to you and say you know what god will do something for that person but he's not going to do it for you he'll fill that person with the holy ghost but he won't feel you he'll use that person to do something special but he won't feel you and you know then jealousy starts creeping in jealousy's such a cruel thing jealousy is what started death in the first place he's at the altar with cain and abel he got jealous and god even told me if you'll just listen and come the provided way you can have the same thing but he wouldn't do it and so many people do that they get jealous and they refuse to go ahead and go on with what god's telling them to do what we need to do is stop being jealous we're the bride there is no schisms in the bride that's differences divisions we're to pull for one another that's why i say the mate believer in the unbeliever i don't care who you are i'm still going to pull for you until god calls me home one of these days it's up to you to decide but i'll still pull for you speaking on down the children down in in egypt you know something's going to put you in egypt and and we're all born in sinful flesh we come to the world speaking lies you know brother brahms said that god doesn't judge you for being a sinner he judges you for staying a center he's made every provided way to get you out of that condition that you're in but so many people are satisfied with staying in egypt you know something's going to put something put you in egypt but god is trying to get you out brother rem says first let's review in genesis to see why they were down in egypt why would god's people be in that land after all god had promised right there at the beginning with abraham isaac jacob and palestine god gave them the land and said this is it and then the people to not be in that place that god provided for them he said that's the question of today also god give us pentecost he give us the book of acts he gives us the holy spirit to leading goddess he give us a land why are we out of it why is the church out of it why is the great christian church today living not living like the book of acts bringing forth the same thing he said there's some reason for it we all know that we're broke up we're in a terrible condition the most terrible condition that christianity has ever lived in is today we're on the right on the brim of a great terrific judgment laying for the church and the judgment can happen god is calling in exodus or before the judgment is happening god is calling in exodus just like he did then he said they they went down in egypt all because of the jealousy of a brother that's the reason israel was in egypt at the time of the land remember god's promise was only as long as they stayed in the land now you can see we were speaking in prayer a few moments ago why god would have to harden pharaoh's heart bring them people back to that promised land and he talks about hitler installing them being hardened so them jews could get back into their homeland which is a sign of that we are at the end israel returning back to our homeland he says and we find out by doing this that joseph was taken among his brethren the denominations and set out to himself his brothers and all the land and then there comes such a great thing we realize that israel as long as they dwelt in their dwelling place and kept up now that was one good thing to stay in that place positionally that's right but they got rid of the spirit the fundamentals today positionally know what they are but by intellectual conception of the bible there's no spirit they've rejected joseph turning them out they want to say it's nothing but a bunch of holy rollers we want nothing to do with it they've excommunicated him sold him out to the world they were out of fellowship that's the last thing we want to do is get out of fellowship now the story of this jealous brothers is certainly of great comparison with the spiritual side of it today we're all aware that it's jealousy not pure it's old dirty filthy jealousy see there's no purity and jealousy there's nothing but filthy jealousy when they see the same bible the nature of the same god that wrote the bible vindicating himself and then turned turn it down without a reason he said as i said it's dirty jealousy watching god heal the sick raise up the dead the same god that lived in the days of the apostles the same god that wrote the spiritual journey is the same god that does the same thing so that's nothing but jealousy the bride has no room for jealousy jealousy gets us out of our position jealousy causes us to bicker and fight with one another what we need to do is pull for one another but first corinthians 12 18 but now hath god set the members every one of them in the body has it pleased him for our calmly parts have no need but god had tempered the body together given more abundant honor to that which is lacked that there should be no schism division in the body but that the members should have the same care one for another and whether one members suffer all the members suffer with it or one member be honored all the members rejoice with it now ye are the body of christ and members in particulars brother rahm says sometimes we found out that brethren the precious faith as i've heard myself and they would say oh brother branham i don't believe it's any use for me to go any further i was over to hear billy graham and there was many thousands of people and i was out to hear the most noble brother or roberts and thousands of the people pack the tent it just seems like maybe a little crowd my little crowd doesn't mean too much he said but you're so wrong he said do you appreciate your finger you wouldn't what your fingers say because i'm not an eye or ear i won't act anymore he said it's no different we need to pull for one another i wouldn't want to lose my finger either we we want all the parts to be together and all the parts will be together of this bride speak romans 12 10 says be kindly affectionate one to another with brotherly love and honor preferring one another in hebrews 10 says let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promised let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is but exhorting one another and that much more as you see the day approaching nobody can take your place no matter how little you say i'm just a housewife nobody can take your place said god and his great economy has said it so the body of christ in order till there is no one that can take your place brother brown speaks on how i would like to take brother billy graham's place and any of the ministers but we can't do it but just remember billy can't take our place see all have a place some of us evangelists prophets teachers some pastors whatever we are some housewives some mechanics some farmers whatever it is god has set you in your place so there's no need in jealousy because god has put you where he wants you and he'll take care of you if he put you there he'll take care of you we've got one enemy that's satan not each other god told but we've got something to do because god told them down in egypt i give you that land but he didn't say i'll go out and sweep it out and garnish the houses and hang up the curtains and everything you'll just move in they had to fight for every inch of ground they took and that's right fighting and take it by every inch but he said everywhere the soles of your foot lands that's possession footsteps is possession that's the same thing today divine healing belongs to us the holy spirit belongs to us it's our property but you'll fight for every inch of it yes sir but brother footsteps is possession just keep fighting take it the devil say the days of miracle or past say you're lying god said he's the same yesterday today and forever he said take it over everywhere your footsteps that's possession that's right i like this story brother talk brother brown talks about old buddy robinson and i think if we just get the attitude that buddy robinson had we get a lot further with god he said old buddy robinson kept going along he wanted the holy ghost said glory to god i want the holy ghost so bad i don't know what to do he said i was plowing corn one morning with old alec his mule said alex kept stepping on the corn and i got mad at him run over there and bit him on the air talk about a temper he said alec kicked at me said i went over and sat down i looked at him standing there said i bid old alec as hard as i could said i looked over him said alec said alec i'm sorry i won't do that no more said looked around said you don't get alex seemed to look around and say you don't get no more religion than that what you got now you'd treat me that way again he said mohammad that's right he said i got down the cornrow and said good lord give me lots of knowledge and the gabled into my soul help me fight the devil as long as i have a tooth in my mouth and gum until i die he said lord if you don't give me the holy ghost when you come back to earth you're gonna find a pile of bones laying right here he said he got it i think that's the important thing he got it my goodness he had an attitude just to begin you think well i got to get right with god i've got to do this i've got to do that you ain't got to do nothing you got to surrender god he'll fill you with the holy ghost if you'll just surrender brother ram said he got it he says you want to belong in heaven that's where your affections ought to be on things above jesus said set your affections on things above not on things of the earth they're going to fail stay with god stay with realities because god is a god of reality so many though they don't receive the holy ghost because they don't think god cares about them they don't think god's watching them thank god watched over me then this situation probably wouldn't be happening to me right now probably wouldn't be going through this thing why so and so always have good things happening to them they seem to live the overcoming life here i'm sitting here trying i'm doing the best i can for god and these things are happening but god does care god might just be trying to temper you a little bit try to mold you a little bit you think about the story of job you think job had it easy he didn't have it easy at all he was put to the test brother braham says sometimes the believers are put to the test not sometimes but every time for every son that cometh to god must be chastened trial chain train remember the trials the dusty roads the hot sun of persecution but the loyalty of your heart beats the material till she's ready to go in the mold god's children is made correctly on his word for you are living examples the word of god living through them see the trial comes to shake you to put you at the very bottom to see where you stand they tested try every son that comes to god he says but when job struck that revelation that it wasn't god he was only going through his trials to make something of him it wasn't god doing it it was satan doing it he said that's the thing today he'll try to tell you satan speaking of satan he'll try to put these trials and say that you're god putting punishment upon you it isn't so no sir it's satan doing that and god's permitting it to temper you to see if you're tied to this earth by the earth cares or whether your treasures are in heaven for where your treasures is there your heart is also so we're preparing for rapture as i was speaking earlier the rapture is a process and it's even happening now and so these trials these things that we face are just things to prepare us for what we're fixing to experience just as abraham couldn't receive the promised son without a body change so can we not receive the promised son without a body change soul is redeemed but we're still in sinful flesh but we're looking towards a promise to be changed one of these days that change is only going to come through the holy ghost through being sealed by the believing the message of this hour brother branham would talk he say that's the reason i do believe when that bride is called out that elected set in the book of life there will come a sound from heaven take such a baptism of the holy spirit that that bride will take her from the earth and a rapturing get grace god promised it we've got to have that rapture in grace the only way to have it is to have that wedding ring on that wedding garment that baptism of the holy ghost is so important it's the only thing that's going to get us out of here but i like this at the end musicians would come he says this he said the other day i was standing on the street corner and i was standing there with watching the armistice day parade and it went up going up the street and i stood there with my little son joseph there come the first old war tanks come by little old tanks after that the great sherman tanks of the new war and great cannons with their muzzle blast a muzzle break and so forth there come the soldiers and the gold star mothers and there come with a float on down a float in front of a grave of the unknown soldier there's a soldier there standing there at the guard of that grave stood a marine on the other side and a sailor on the other side and there was a partition drawn and on the other side said a gold star mother she had lost her boy there stood a young wife with her head over the table crying a little ragged boy setting sideways tears running out of his face because he lost his daddy he said i thought what sadness i stand here and look see them old just a few of the soldiers left marching down there crippled and old with their uniforms but proudly displaying because they were americans he said i thought oh god one of these days there's going to come a blast from heaven and the dead in christ shall rise first them old testament saints back yonder who are waiting will blast forth and come out of there first and go into the resurrection will drop right in line going into the sky these old mortal bodies changed and made like unto his own glorious body he said what a parade that will be when we starts heavenward some of these days and the rapturing time that lays ahead old proudly displaying the blood of jesus christ upon their chest the message of god in the hour that they lived in that's the hour we're looking forward to brother and i say that's what we're still looking forward to because we're convinced the message is true and it will take place someday amen god bless you i know that was kind of choppy that's what was on my heart i just hope it makes you love him more and convinces you that this is the truth because if you haven't received the holy ghost you can receive the holy ghost god's still calling because we're still here and he's determined to get that last one in i'm determined to be one of them how about you amen god bless you let brother david sing here appreciate that
