he just he just it it just I know I'm not worthy of it that's why that's why it makes me it makes me weep but I also know that he's the almighty God and and he's able to to overcome my own insufficiencies and I'm thankful for thaten we're going to tonight is this cutting out for the Joel uh tonight we're going to have we're going to have a youth service tonight I want you to all to come all of you that want to be here I want you to come but I want our young people to sit on the front and uh and just really listen tonight I want to preach to you Lord put something on my heart kind of goes with what we're preaching this morning we want to speak to you tonight and uh it's good to see brother Wes with us today I know you had an accident this week and and uh the Lord spared brother Wes and and we're thankful for that and and uh we know we go through things but God sees it he knows it before we go through it and so he knows how to get us out of of it you believe that today amen amen God bless you uh I think uh did your brother Justin your mother-in-law make it in is she here this morning she's in the back God bless you say it's good to have you I know brother Joel greeted you a welcome to the area she's moved here with us and uh we're just grateful for each one that the Lord would allow to to come with us and uh be a part and we want to be a help to every way that we can amen Isaiah 42 and verse 1 says behold my servant whom I uphold my elect in whom my soul delighteth I have put my spirit upon him he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles he shall not cry nor lift up nor cause his voice to be heard in the street a bruised Reed shall he not break and the smoking flax shall he not quench he shall bring forth judgment unto truth he shall not fail that's talking about Christ here says he will not fail I'm so grateful for that today he shall not fail nor be discouraged till he have set judgment in the earth and the aisle shall wait for his law pray the Lord with that his Blessing to the word you may be seated this morning when Christ come to the Earth he came in a as a manifestation as an expression of the character of God and in that he came and expressed to us that part of God in different ways he he was expressed as what God was and and what God wanted us to see it was God's Masterpiece on the earth and and we know that the prophets could only express so much in in their own lives but each one of them failed in some way not being the the reality of it but there came one who was perfect and there became one who was the reality that we could look at that this is what God is this is deity manifested in human flesh and so we know that one of the things that he manifested one of the ways that he manifested himself to us was as a servant and we talked about one aspect of that here not long ago brother brandom said it was the god of Glory revealing the glory of God that that he came as a footwash funky so that's one type of servant that he came as excuse me was as a footwash flunky a servant who would actually uh would actually come and wash the disciples feet the very lowest form of a servant but he's also spoken of as The Trusted servant or the one who would come and dispense with his father's or with his master's property the one who could be trusted and the one who would be faithful and in doing that he's presented to us as a suffering servant he's presented to us as one who would be faithful and regardless of the suffering regardless of what would take place regardless of the persecution regardless whether he he even had to go to Calvary but he went anyway and I'm so glad that he did I'm so glad that he didn't give up I'm so glad that he pressed his way through and and and there on golgatha he actually he became the sacrifice for sin I'm so glad that he said not my will but thine be done what is he being he's being the suffering servant he's going to become salvation to us and the only way he can do that is by being a faithful servant I believe he wants us to be Faithful Servants how many would agree with that this morning he wants us to be Faithful Servants he wants somebody who can who can be faithful to the cause uh that he has given us the the the the the thing that he's given us to do yes now we we find him revealed in Isaiah and I just want to look at the scripture for just a moment we read uh in Isaiah 42 there's four passages in the book of Isaiah that speak of Messiah as God's suffering servant and they're known as the songs of the suffering servant they it's actually written as a poem and the first one is the one we read Isaiah 42 1-4 which reveals Christ as the servant who does not engage in self-promotion right now now if you go and read it he he talks about it he said this is my servant my elect and I put my spirit in him but he said he won't engage in self-promotion he said a bruised read he won't break he he won't cry nor lift up he he won't his voice won't be heard in the street right so he's a servant and I think that's what the kind of servant that he wants today as we are expressing Christ in our own lives he wants Servants of God men and women that will be in the world today that will not will not lift up themselves that will not become the main thing but they'll let him be the main thing so this was him he was the servant who would not engage in self-promotion and it was fulfilled in Christ in Matthew 12 if you go to Matthew 12:14 uh when Jesus heals a man on the Sabbath day and the Pharisees got mad because it upset their Pro it's pretty it's bad when when the movement of God and the spirit of God and and and healing actually upsets the program of the Pharisee but it still does today but we want we want to let God move don't we we want to let God do what he does and let him be who he is let him be the healer let him be the Savior let him move whatever way he wants to move in the church Lord we're giving you Freedom today but they got upset because he healed a man on the Sabbath day all right and it didn't fit with what what they wanted to do so so in Matthew 12:14 says then the Pharisees went out and held a counsel against him how they might destroy him but when Jesus knew it he withdrew himself from then and great multitudes followed him and he healed them all and charged them that they should not make him known so he did the opposite of what a t evangelist today would do all right come on right if they had had a healing te place now this in this place it says he healed them all right but instead of going out and and and and beginning to uh beginning to talk to him and saying you know uh I'm the one look at what I've done you can see what I've done here I must be the one and no he didn't put a big banner up that said the man of the hour he didn't promote himself on social media but what did he do he charged him he said don't even tell about it why he was God's servant yes he was just doing what God required amen amen and and so it says he charged them that they should not make him known that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet saying behold my servant whom I have chosen my beloved in whom my soul is well pleased I'll put my spirit upon Him He Shall show judgment to the Gentiles he shall not strive so he will not he will not work and push others down to bring himself up that's he will not cry neither shall any man hear his voice in the street he's not going to go out in the street and says here I and say here I am in fact the world wouldn't even know who he was oh the world the very very few people in the world ever knew Jesus was on the Earth but we know it today why he did what his father called him to do yes you see how he wants us to act and what he wants us to do now he says a bruised Reed shall he not break smoking flax shall he not quench till he send forth judgment unto victory and in his name shall the Gentiles trust so in other words he'll come and he'll do what was he was supposed to do and he'll actually bring Victory but you won't even know he was there Oh my he he he will come and and spend his time and do the things and the people won't even recognize you realize there were people in capernium who bumped into him at the diner who talked to him on the street who who maybe he went and got his uh got things uh done down at the grocer or something like that and went down in the market and they sold him food and they never even realized who he was never even recognized he appeared as just a normal man he was God's suffering servant he was willing to be just an everyday guy he didn't look like a leader brother say he didn't look much like a man uh that would be a leader or a king but he was the king yeah why he was God's servant yes sir now and in his name show the Gentiles trust brother Brown said will notice him what made him different as a speaker I guess he wasn't so forceful and get out in the street like we do and scream because the Bible said his voice was not heard in the street yeah a bruised readed and a smoking flax and so forth as the prophet said he would be so he was just something about his talk oh I want that to be me I want that to be all of us I want that to be this church that we would not be engaged in self-promotion but that we would become the Servants of God until we would not promote ourselves and we would not let our we would not defend ourselves but that we would just do the will of God Amen he said it was just something about his talk that caught the heart of the people yes oh I trust there's something about the word today you didn't come to the house of God to hear a man or to see a man you come for the word of God I appreciate you coming when I'm not here because that tells me you're not coming for the man you're not here just cuz you think the pastor will get mad at you but you come because you want to hear the word of the Lord and the word of the Lord is the same no matter who's preaching it he was just something about his talk that caught the heart of the people I I that's what caught me I appreciate the signs and the Wonders and the things like that but there was something about this message something about the words that the prophet was saying I didn't fall in love with a prophet I fell in love with the word and the prophet was pointing me to Crow something about his talk caught the heart of people he didn't have to be so forceful about it in an outward demonstration but there was something down in his talk that fascinated the hearts of people so this is a servant he he said he will not cry in the street he he will not bruise A a bruised Reed he won't break yeah now brother Brenham says this he says in a in a prayer he said if there be any That's Falling by the wayside strengthen that one that feeble knee oh that's my prayer this morning you may be right at the very end where you feel like you can't take it anymore and you're just about to turn out of the way and I pray that the spirit of God would come over you this morning and would grab a hold of you and arrest you and the spirit of God will strengthen you today a bruised Reed he will not break right or a smoking flax will he not quench see brother Ben I've been bruised but the spirit of God he will not break you he doesn't want to break you he doesn't want to destroy you he wants to mend you yes sir we know that he will brother B said we know he will never turn away a bruised readed he would mend it yes oh that's God's servant today he would never turn away so well they're not good enough to come to this church they're not good enough to do this s or the other no he won't turn away a bruised tree he'll mend the bruised read I think that'll we have to declare the word of God we've got to tell the truth I've got a responsibility to preach the truth I've got to but let me be one when the BR when the when when the Reed is bruised let me be one who says there's something here to menend you there is a bomb in Gilead there is a physician here there is a power of God that can make you different yes sir he will not would not be a lord over God's Heritage but his goal would be to love God and love people yes if you want to be successful in Ministry and I mean real success right you love God and you love people and you'll be a success that's right love God and love people just recently brother BR said was asking me about some very precious Brethren that said now that we've come into the way brother brandom now that we've found the Lord and received the Holy Ghost should we seek gifts for our ministry that we should do I said don't never do it all right don't never do it don't never advise people to do something like that cuz usually a guy that wants to do it is a guy that can't do it all right he said it's the guy that's trying to run from it is the one that God uses see if he's trying to get away from it he said oh brother I tell you the calling is in me so you got to recognize you have a call to do whatever you're going to do for the Lord he said but woo man I'd hate to try that he said well there you are he said that's trying to run if he wants to do it so bad the first thing you know he finds himself a stuff shirt like you say God you give me power to move mountains I tell you I'll do something for you if you let me move mountains no he wouldn't he can't even move himself to the right attitude right I love that you want to move mountains Move Yourself to the right attitude first start treating people right then you can move mountains you want to stand behind the pulpit and preach start treating people right start living for God start doing what you can for the house of God you want to be a deacon or a trustee or something else and then God knows we need those people we need you and I'm thankful for the ones that we have but if you want to be that you got to start serving God's people you got to start loving God's people move yourself to the right attitude then God can use you and so he said so if God is calling you brother and he keeps digging at your heart I'd say lay aside every way and the sin that does so easily beset you you see but if it's not digging at you he said I wouldn't think too much about it just let it come to its place got to be something Jeremiah said it's a fire shut up in my bones I can't help it I've got to preach I I don't want to preach but I got to preach I I don't want to I don't want to be in front of people it's not my nature to be here in front of people but but there's something about it I've got to declare the word of the Lord so as long as I have opportunity let me stand here and do that let me fulfill the word of the Lord let me say what a prophet said let me preach the message of the hour somebody's got to do it let me be a servant that's willing to stand and do it somebody's got to be willing to do it yes and he said just let it come to its place the Bible tells us promotion cometh neither from the East nor from the West nor from the South but God is the judge he putteth down one and Seth up another I was reading while I was gone I read the uh uh autobiography of of President Grant us Grant and he was talking about the war he was a general in the war and he said this he I wrote it down he said it is men who wait to be selected not those who seek from whom we may always expect the most efficient service right because they're not promoting themselves they'll be a servant the second one in Isaiah is in Isaiah 491 1-6 and it depicts a servant who will persevere in his ministry even though the results aren't there now I want to really dwell on this for a moment because I want to be that as a pastor but you want to be that as a parent you want to be that as a as a church member you want to be that as a grandparent somebody that'll persevere in prayer even though it seems like the results aren't there even though it seems like your kids are just as far going as they ever were but you're going to keep praying anyway even though it seems like things are not going and and you're not seeing the results that you want to see but you keep coming to the house of God you keep doing what God called you to do you might have been sick for years and years and yet you keep on claiming your healing you your kids might have been in a bad place but you keep on claiming your children why do you do that because you're a servant of God there's something in you it's a spirit of Christ in you wanting calling out out wanting to bring that person to the place where they ought to be so it's a servant who will persevere listen to how Isaiah puts it Isaiah 49 And1 listen on ales unto me and hearken you people from farar the Lord has called me from the womb from the bowels of my mother have he made mention of my name so he says I I I've been called to be what I am I was born to be this Heath made my mouth like a sharp sword in the shadow of his hand of he hi me he made me a polished shaft in his quiver hath he hid me and said unto me thou art my servant oh Israel and whom I will be glorified then I said now watch and I think every one of us gets to this place at some point in our life and our ministry in our service in the office that we fill we get into a place where we say this I said I have labored in vain I have spent my strength for not and in vain he said yet surely my judgment is with the Lord so in other words I can't look at what people say I need to look at what God is saying I can't let social media be the judge of whether or not I I've been a success I'm not going to let the world be the judge or whether or not let me laugh at me make fun of me because the way I dress or what I do but I'm going to let God be the judge I'm not going to get discouraged until I see the work of the Lord go forward amen so he said I he said I've labored in vain and I've spent my strength for not but surely my judgment is with the Lord he said now sayith the Lord that formed me from the womb to be his servant to bring Jacob again to him though Israel be not gathered Oh my he said though I don't see the result of it listen to me church it's so important especially if you're going to be involved in Ministry if you're going to be involved in church leadership you or with your families you need to recognize that you're not always going to see the results you want to see right sir you're not always going to see some of you that work out you know what I'm talking about brother Daniel you know you're not always going to see the results you want to see the first day you're not always going to see it the second day you're not always going to see it the fifth day yeah all right right but if you keep doing it if you can keep doing it if you can persevere now I haven't been able to persevere very well in that way but I'll say this the very first day I started to pre I didn't see the results that I wanted to see as a 12 13 14 year old boy I didn't always see it when I was 16 but JT when we I was 20 years old and I started pastoring there at branville I didn't always see the results we wanted to see but we kept coming back we kept preaching preaching the gospel and I'm saying that not to elevate myself but to tell you it works eventually you begin to see the results you don't see them all at once but eventually if you love God and you love people eventually you begin to see what you or what you've been looking for the whole time yes oh you begin to see a place you know I just wanted a place I could take my kids where there's no there's no drama and stuff going on we're not trying to hurt anybody we're just trying to preach the word we just want a place where we can preach the message and I can preach whatever I see in the message and you can amen it if it's the word I just want the freedom of the Holy Spirit to be able to move and we're about to see some results from that but if we don't see the results we want today we'll keep preaching for tomorrow if we don't see them tomorrow we preaching the next day don't get discouraged because it's not what you think it ought to be right now yes sir keep working keep pushing oh my that's what God's servant did yes oh my that's what his his great servant Christ it's what he did said though Israel be not gathered yet shall I be glorious in the eyes of the Lord my God shall be my strength he said it is a light thing that thou should us be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob and to restore the preserved of Israel I will also he said give thee for a light to the Gentiles that thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the Earth but you know Jesus didn't go to the Gentiles while he was alive in fact for his ministry to be effective to the Gentiles he had to die yeah Oh my he was sent to the lost sheep of Israel but to be affective of the body to the Gentiles he could not be affected and that's why he the S Phoenician woman come before him and he wouldn't even recognize her the first time why because she was a gentile yeah and he told the disciples he said go to the lost sheep of the House of Israel don't even go to the Gentiles all right and when they come to see him when the Greeks come to see him they said sir we would see Jesus and he wouldn't even he said except a corn of wheat fall into the ground it can't become what it is is what it's supposed to be but what was it he was looking to the Future the Bible said for the joy that was set before him he endured the cross what was the joy we're his bride the Gentiles were called to be a bride you believe that we're his wife and so to be his wife to gain his wife he had to die oh if we could look not at what's going on right now but if we could crucify the Flesh and bear our cross carry our cross and let the future results be what they are yes good trusting and believing that God's going to bring it about if we'll just be faithful this is quoted by Simeon in Luke Chapter 2 think of the old the old Prophet the old man of great spiritual ability to be able to expect an expectation of the coming of Christ and he walks down to Jesus the Lord has told him he said before before you die you're going to to see the salvation of the Lord and you know maybe in his mind he thought well I'm going to see Israel delivered I'm going to see the Romans run off and I'm going to see all the things happen but it's not what he got to see the Fulfillment of the prophecy that was given to him was much different maybe than what he initially thought it would be and I think we need to not despise the day of small things we need to be able to recognize as God's servants when God's doing something and recognize it in seed form and see the potential of what it's going to be yes otherwise you'll get discouraged and you'll quit all right right because you know maybe you come here and I know several folks here are new to the church or new to the area and you'll come and you expect certain things and you expect things to to go better for you and or you wouldn't come here you want you want your children to have friends and you want things to happen and you you wouldn't come here otherwise you want you want it to be right and anytime you come to a different church or a new church or or you start coming back to church you you think well everything's going to be good and and yet you you'll face obstacles when when you come and and there'll be people that maybe aren't maybe they're human and and you find out that they're human and they don't always treat you like they should and and you'll find out that there's there's situations that that'll go wrong and you'll think well uh maybe you get discouraged but remember you got to be able to see and Seed form what God's doing you got to be able to see what the future holds you got to be able to see I won't have my children forever and maybe everything's not perfect right now but we're building something and we're pressing towards something and it'll never be perfect till we get in a Rapture get a body change but we're pressing for that we're moving towards that we're not a perfect church but we're we're we're pressing to something so you've got to be able to see it in seed form and look at it and say God this is what you've called me to I'm not going to quit I'm not going to give up I'm going to let God be God and I'm just going to keep coming to the house of God you said but I'm not perfect I I thought I'd have lost some of these besetting sins I thought I would be healed I thought these things would happen just keep plugging away just keep coming back to the throne keep coming back to the house of God be patient with God see it in its infancy yes sir because one day it'll be grown up maybe you won't even realize it and you look and say wait a minute what I longed for is here yes amen yes what I worked for is coming yes so Simeon takes up Jesus in his arms blessed God and said Lord now letest thou thy servant depart in peace according to Thy word look at the great faith the man had for mine eyes have seen thy salvation many couldn't see him in a baby form they couldn't recognize that that was God coming down wrapping himself in flesh but Simeon recognized who he was and today many people can't see that this message will ever be anything thing but they can't see that the seed to the Rapture has already been planted and the plant is growing come on the bride's becoming a mature bride yes he said let thy servant depart in peace for mine eyes have seen thy salvation which thou has prepared before the face of all people a light to light in the Gentiles and the glory of thy People Israel I want you to take heart some of you Elders that have been working in the church for many many many years the seeds of God's word that you helped to plant that you tilled the soil for that you worked for all of these years it's beginning to come about bow there's going to be a Rapture one of these days we're going to see it you may not see it in your lifetime but you can say I can depart in peace because I've seen the salvation of Israel I've seen the word born in the hearts of the people and I know that this message will carry them all the way through you can see the potential of what this baby would be even though no one else recognized it he said this is my servant he won't be discouraged he won't be discouraged be a light to the Gentiles even though he has to die first think of David's men who were there brother Bram talks about in why little Bethlehem how that David's men would would gather and they were they would stayed with David even though he was a fugitive even though he was an outlaw even though he's running from the law but they stayed with him because they believed in the potential of what he would be they said someday he's going to be the king yeah and David was caught between that Philistine Army and he was there on the hillside and he looked down 15 miles away and he thought about Bethlehem he said oh for a drink of the water from the well at Bethlehem and he didn't even ask for it he didn't he didn't direct them to go do it but his men heard it and when they heard it his wish become their command and they fought their way through 15 miles of Philistines to bring a fresh drink of bethlehem's water back to David when they got back he poured it out he said I'm not even worthy of this sacrifice what was it what was it they recognized who he would be they could see him as a king even though he was a fugitive at the time oh that you could see this message for more than what the internet says that it is if you could see this message for more than what the world around you says that it is but there's a reality to it there's a seed that's been planted there's a Rapture coming there's a king that'll sit on the throne of David do you believe it today oh that you can see it in the form it's in and say I'm willing to fight for I'm willing to bring him a fresh drink of Pentecostal water I'm willing to worship even though I may not feel like worshiping I'm willing to raise my hands so I may not feel like raising my hands I'm going to preach whether I feel like it or not why because I know that he's going to be king so I'm going to treat him like a king I'm going to treat him like a king right now because I know what he will be good yes sir do you believe that today his servant yeah would recognize we're not rewarded for our success but for our faithfulness amen elzer was Abraham's faithful servant it's a great type of Christ also the messenger in this day brother brandom said he said we say big numbers God don't notice big numbers all right God looks for character he said El sweated it out I like that elizer sweated it out till he found character in Rebecca yes then he had to get her dressed up ready let her stand still and listen at his message yeah he said the trouble of it is today when you find character it's hard to make them stand still long enough to put on clothes and get dressed up all right we need to stand still and let the message dress us today but El are sweated it out now he said you'll be a light to the Gentiles brother brandom taught us we're only responsible to scatter the light yeah it'll be a light to those maybe that we don't even know we don't even recognize who we've impacted with our life but we got to let it be that way and not demand the recognition but just say Lord let me live in such a way that the postman knows I'm a Christian that the housewife knows I'm a Christian that the person I do business with knows I'm a Christian let me live in such a way that the light is scattered to every possible corner of the country that I would never show my just my Humanity but that you could show yourself through me let me be your eyes let me be your feet Let Me Be Your Hands let me be you in in body form good yes and you may never see the results of that but the light is still scattered the third time Isaiah speaks of the servant is in Isaiah 50 4th through N I just I just love the word of the Lord It's So Perfect yeah and we believe the Bible do you believe the Bible today the Bible is right the Bible is Right old song said I know the Bible is Right somebody's wrong so the Bible's right so we we want to take what we believe from the word of God and that's where a prophet he was a word prophet he come what he believed from the word of God and and and Shine the Light on that word that we would understand what it is without a prophet we wouldn't understand Isaiah 50 and4 says the Lord God ha given me the tongue of the learned I should know how to speak a word in season so God's servant now if you're following me now his servant was one who would not get discouraged yeah he was one who would who put up with hardship yeah he was one who was not a self-promoter and he was one who could speak a word in season yes to him that is weary he wenth morning by morning he wenth by ear to hear as the learned the Lord God ha opened my ear and I was not rebellious neither turned away back so in other words I just I just repeated what I heard so the servant would be one who would say nothing except what God told him to say I'd say God help me to be that kind of a servant today God help all of us to be that kind of a servant the Lord's opened my ears and I and I was not rebellious I gave my back to the smiters so if the word called for me you so he was not rebellious to the word that even hurt him the word said that he would oh my his his his form would be marred the word said that they would they would use a whip on him and he was not rebellious to that word he said even so let it be yes sir not my will but thine be done I gave my back to the smiters my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair I hid not my face from shame and spitting for the Lord God will help me therefore shall I not be confounded therefore have I set my face like a flint and I know that I shall not be ashamed so he's saying as a servant of God I've got to not get distracted by the persecution but I've got to set my face like a flint yes sir listen if you're if if if you know God has called you to do something you need to set your face like a flint you need to you need to set your face like a flint and say I don't care what happen happens I know God called me to do this I'm going to do it I know God called me to have my family in the house of God I'm going to see I'm going to make sure it gets done yeah I'm going to set my face like a flint I know that God called me to be healed I'm going to set my face like a flint my body may not feel like I'm Healed the symptoms may not have changed I'm going to set my face like a flint how can I do that because the spirit of Christ is in me and the suffering servant set his face like a flint all right he said I know I shall not be ashamed he is near that justifieth me who will contend with me I love that let us Stand Together who is my adversary let him come near to me so he said it doesn't matter what comes if Goliath comes down my way I'm going to defeat Goliath I if the cross comes down my way I'm going to be victorious over the cross I'm going to set my face like a flint to do the will of God oh that we had more deacons and trustees and and and Housewives said church members that would set their face like a flint all right we're going to church today oh the persecution might be out there I might be flogged the enemy might be coming my way but we're going to church we're going to do what's right we're going to live for God I've set my face like a flint I'm not going to give up I'm not going to look back I'm not going to turn away I'm going to do what God called me to do I'm going to be if God called you to be a housewife you I'm going to set my face like a flint I'm going to be the very best housewife that God called me to be if God called me to be a preacher I'm going to set my face like a flint I'm not going to let discouragement come and come against me I'm not going to let anything keep me from the will of God that my face like a flint said behold the Lord God will help me oh that gives us Comfort does it I can do what God called me to do said brother Ben you don't understand the age is different yes it is but God's the same and shamgar didn't need to change the Philistines or wait for them to weaken he just needed to recognize who he was that's right he didn't need them to get inferior armor he didn't need to wait on them to to to somehow give up or give in so well I'll wait till the time is convenient it'll never be convenient set your face like a fln and do what God said yeah all right said I'm going to set my face like a flint to speak a word in season to the weary amen oh my Luke 9:51 speaks of the Fulfillment of this it said it came to pass when the time was come that he should be received up he steadfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem God's servant set his face like a flint I'm going to be a real dad I'm going I'm going to I'm going to raise my kids in church I'm going to do what's right I'm going to read the Bible to them I'm going to tell them about God I'm going to believe the message of the hour I don't care what the internet says I don't care what my friends say I don't care what anybody else says I set my face like a flint I believe the word of God is true I believe he's the same yesterday today and forever I'm going to go forward I'm going to move forward let's if we could only do that in 2024 if we can move forward the 2023 is behind us we can't look behind us we got to move forward set our face like a flint right if it calls us to go to Calvary we'll go to Calvary if we have to go to persecution we'll go to persecution oh that the people of the message of the hour would set their face like a flint and say there's a Rapture ahead of us let's go get it all right we don't care what the persecution is it's good he was willing to do what his father asked brother Brandon said this he said after coming out of meetings like this he said I get so tired I can't sleep I I don't know I know some of you have been like that you work you get so tired you can't sleep he said so I was telling Billy coming over he said Daddy you look so tired I said but Billy I must put every effort yes he said why don't you go over there and just don't speak to the people just say I'll pray for the sick run the prayer line as you promised them and don't speak but see God didn't call him just to run the prayer line all right God called him to be a a preacher God called him to be a prophet to the age he had to speak he I'm so glad he said something he had to say something he had something to say yeah right so he said he said why don't you just go run the prayer line I said Billy he said there's not many people there today daddy a little bitty meeting I said I would put the same effort there if there's a 100,000 he said I said because I'm Duty Bound by the love of God that constrains me to his church brother BR said something that he often said and it's made me think brother so many many times he said I've often thought what I would do with two drops of the literal blood of Jesus Christ in a glass now you can say all you want to about it wouldn't mean nothing to you it would if you knew that the two drops of blood that you had was the blood that was spilled for you how would you treat it all right yeah you'd put it in a case put that case in a bigger case put that in a safe deposit box in the in the bank you you you'd make sure it was protected you'd want people to see it but you wouldn't want any danger to come near it you'd put it on a soft pillow you'd make sure if you had to hold it in your hands that you didn't drop it yeah and brother BR talks about that and he says if I had those two drops what would I do he said I wouldn't want to spill it I would hold it to my chest up to my heart and say Lord God how I appreciate this Blood sir oh God but in his sight he said I have greater this afternoon I've got the purchase of his blood before me do you realize who you are this morning you're not just a a bunch of people that have belied some some things some Doctrine and come together you're the purchase of the blood of Jesus Christ you're what he died for the most precious perfect sinless blood that there's ever been the only perfect one that's ever been spilled his blood for you believe I he spilled it for you then how should I treat you the same way I would that literal blood amen yes I do everything I could to speak a word in season yeah to watch my words to watch my actions oh God help me today but he don't want that just from preachers he wants that from each and every one of us how should we treat one another if we knew that we were the purchase of his blood good he said how should I treat you he said he loved you better than he loved his own life how should I treat you honest sincerely he said in sin I must call out no matter how bad it hurts you or I but because you're precious to God yeah he's going to have a bride without spot a wrinkle so he'll call his ministers sometimes to say things that hurt people sometimes it'll hurt you but they're not doing it for the purpose of hurting if they are they don't belong in the Pulpit right but they do it why do they have to do it because they recognize the preciousness of the blood of the purchase of his blood I must do everything that I can to be honest and upright and a servant to Christ the fourth song are you still with me this morning the fourth song is found in Isaiah 52 and 53 it'd be much more famili Amar to you beginning with verse 13 of Isaiah 52 speaking of a servant who is exalted through suffering the Way Up Is Down said behold my servant verse 13 behold my servant shall deal prudently he shall be exalted and extolled and be very high and the next verse seems like it doesn't even fit with the 13th verse but it does said as many were astonished at thee you know when he said if I be lifted up I'll draw a men to me he wasn't talking about us talking good about him he's speaking about his death that's how he got exalted oh my that's how he was lifted up he was lifted up above the Earth so that men could see this is the Salvation of God as many as were Aston at the his Visage was so marred more than any man come on in other words see they beat him until you couldn't even tell that he was a human being all right oh God and his his form more than the sons of men yes verse 15 so shall he sprinkle many nations Oh my he had to be beaten he had to be brought down so he could be lifted up he shall sprinkle many nations the Kings shall shut their mouths at him for they which had not been told them for that which had not been told them shall they see and that which they had not heard shall they they consider who ha believed our report to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed he's talking about his servant yes he shall grow up before him as a tender plant as a root out of dry ground speaking of the Virgin birth Heath no form nor comeliness and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him he comes as the servant of Jehovah he comes as the steward of Salvation oh God to distribute salvation to us his only purpose is to serve his master to serve his father so he comes and he's despised and rejected of men a Man of Sorrows acquinted with grief we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised we esteemed him not surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows do you have a sorrow today do you have a grief is there something that's bothering you do you have anxiety in your life let him bear that he come to do that amen he has borne our griefs carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of God and Afflicted yes but he was wounded for our transgressions yes yes so he become the servant of God come on yes sir and God told his servant he said go get me a bride are you with me now in the allegory of it in the drama of it so he wraps himself in flesh and he becomes the servant of Jehovah he comes down to get a bride and how's he going to get this bride this would teach some of yall looking for a wife some things if we have anybody looking for a wife or a husband you want to know how to gain a spouse this is how he did it he completely surrendered himself to the will of God come on yes sir you want to know how to get a Ministry how to do something for God it's complete surrender ER to the will of God he went to get his wife and how did he do it now the servant said I'll do whatever it takes what did elizar say Lord Prosper my journey he said I'll send my angel before you he said whatever it takes I want to get that wife my soulle mission in life if I die doing it I'm going to go do it and what did Jesus do he come to get a wife for Jehovah and when he did what did he do as the servant remember he presenting him as a servant today as a servant of God he comes he's despised and rejected a man he has to be beaten but if that's what it takes to to dispense salvation because the servant was the steward who would dispense to each one that part of his master's Goods that that that would that would cause the uh economy of his master to run smoothly so in the economy of God he is the dispenser of Salvation and in order to do that he has to be beaten he has to be blooded he has to be bruised yes you think we're going to get by with anything less all right come on I think about it he was wounded for my transgressions we could put our name there can we do that this morning he was bruised for Benjamin PR its iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him with his stripes I am healed oh my we can say it like that this morning all we like sheep have gone astray we've turned everyone to his own way and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all yes he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he has brought as a lamb to the slaughter as a sheep before her shears is dumb so he openeth not his mouth he was taken from prison and from judgment who shall declare his generation he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people was he stricken he made his grave with the Wicked with the rich in his death because he had done no violence neither was any deceit in his mouth yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him he have put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hands so he's going to be a prosperous servant because he's willing to do what his master requires him to do he shall see the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many for he shall bear their iniquities therefore will I divide him a portion with the great he shall divide the spoil with the strong because Heath poured out his soul unto death he was numbered with the transgressors he bear the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors he was Jehovah's trusted servant his Steward now watch Jesus becomes the servant of God to dispense healing and salvation to us but he's more than a servant he's a son he's the son of God how many you believe that today he's the son of God so he's the servant son Hebrews 3:1 wherefore holy Brethren partakers of the Heavenly calling consider the Apostle and high priest of our profession Christ Jesus who is faithful I mean someone say faithful he was faithful to him that appointed him as also Moses was faithful in all his house and that's why I could say this morning and you could raise your hands with me and say all my life He's been Faithful all my life he's been so good why the Bible says he was faithful yes and he this man he said was counted worthy of more Glory than Moses in as much as Heath builded the house with more honor than the house so he's not just a servant like Moses was but he's also the son he said for every house is build by some man but he that built all things is God and Moses fairily was faithful in all his house as a servant for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after but but Christ as a son over his own house so the son became a servant all right oh this morning you might say well brother Ben I'm a Son of God I'm a daughter of God but it's time that the sons and daughters become took on the form of servants what what for what purpose to dispense salvation are you with me so far Christ is a son over his own house whose house are we If We Hold Fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the Hope firm until the end the Bible tells us we are called to be stewards of God's house 1 Corinthians 4:1 let a man so account of us as of the Ministers of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God all right oh God he said moreover it is required in stewards that a man be found faithful you said but brother Ben that's for a preacher yes it is but it's also for the congregation because the Bible tells us in 1 Peter 4:10 he said as every man someone say every man every every man hath received the gift he said but brother Ben I never got anything you received the gift you may not speak with tongues but you have the gift yeah you may not you may not run the house but you have the gift and you may have all kinds of gifts in your life but you have the gift I know you have the gift if you're a Christian he said even so Minister the same one to another as good stewards yes of the manifold grace of God yeah so if he being God's servant was willing to suffer to to dispense salvation to the world oh God if you just see what I'm saying this morning couldn't we as a servants and Sons and Daughters who were servants over God's house if we could only learn to be suffering servants yeah faithful stewards of life and we have something precious I wonder if we realize that this morning I just be a few more minutes and we'll close but I wonder if we realize how precious the message of the hour is all right not very many people hold it all right few are still care about it yeah you realize how precious it is you realize how precious the gift of Salvation is the the baptism of the Holy Ghost and that was a gift to you that come in your life and changed you brother JT and just just made you different you realize how precious that is oh it's so precious you look at the world and you think I would be just like them there's nothing better in me than there is in the world I would be just like the world I recognize the weakness of my own flesh I recognize what I could be and what I could do but the gift of God has come to me and it's a precious thing yeah it's the most valuable thing there is in the world we hold in our hands eternal life yes think about that for a minute yeah you know you if you're a nurse the reason why it's such in demand there such a demand for nurse nursing for those positions is because it's the key to life at least to a better life maybe a little bit longer life a nurse or a doctor even brother alen with the gym it's a key to a better life that's what you're selling people you're not selling people exercise you're selling people a better life right that's what they're doing they're looking for life but that's not the kind of life we have this morning and that's a wonderful thing to have there's nothing against that if I could be a doctor my kids could be doctors I'd want them to be I want them to do that I'd want them to give Natural Life to people you think whatever way that you can do that make people's lives better go do it sir but when it comes oh my when it comes to what we have it's not natural life it's eternal life and within me is the knowledge and the ability to dispense to some other person who doesn't have it that's right amen on now yeah I think about it yes sir he was just one man the perfect man he gave his life brother the Joel I think you shared this the other day he made an example for you now what must we do all right he said the first thing I want to say is Jesus never lived for himself yes his life was spent for others that's perfectly eternal life when you say you go to church and you do things that's fine but when you live your life to yourself you hav an eternal life eternal life is living for others he said it proved it when it come in the Lamb of God he lived and had eternal life because he did not live for himself he lived for others and you receive eternal life by receiving that day how many you received that day I believe that Jesus died for me I know that I've been forgiven if you know you've been forgiven today then you can give that out to others amen he Liv for others and you receive eternal life by receiving that that day and you don't live for yourself no more you live for others yes Jesus did not do these things because he had to he did them because that's who he was it was just inside him brother so we don't he makes a point in the sermon that day on Calvary to tell us that we don't do these things cuz we're forced to right we don't do these things because we think well I need to do it you do it because there's something inside of you that becomes a suffering servant why because that's what he was you have his spirit in you that's good he said forgive me my Pentecostal friend I'm I am Pentecostal my Pentecostal friend's got to a spot where it has to be a lot of fast music beating with some bands clapping hands or tamb brings to bring up a shout yeah he said that's only emotion they play in bands before they go to battle they get people in the emotion of battle he said I believe in music he's not saying it's wrong he said I believe in it yeah I believe in clapping hands I believe in these things he said that's exactly true we ought to have that yeah but you've left the great things undone yeah what's the great thing that self-sacrificed life that God lives in you automatically doing that which is right because it's right that's not going to church because you're afraid somebody will will miss you and say well you know they'll start talking about me but you go because it's right that's right amen not not not living in a way that would be recognize the needs of others and helping others because you feel like somebody wants is going to make you do it but because it's right yeah oh my just living it he said just going on don't even think nothing about it just living it see the Bible tells us he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works so if he if one aspect of the works of what he was was a suffering servant then the church is going to do Greater Works than he did now look we know one aspect of that is more there's more of us but look what brother brand says about it here he said notice the Greater Works was to have the power in the church not only to heal the Sick by prayer cast out Devils by prayer but to impart eternal life to Believers the Holy Ghost was coming and given into the hands of the church to impart life sir oh he said that's what Calvary meant it took sto degraded men and women and lifted them into a place to be Sons and Daughters of God to heal the sick to impart life eternal life by giving the Holy Ghost to obedient Believers men who were once unbelievers be made Believers and impart spiritual eternal life oh my yes he said poor blind wretched people how do you miss that don't you see what the greater thing is that's the greatest thing could ever happen was to impart eternal life to people what is eternal life the life that he lived the life that was in him impart that to others can a man do that a Son of God can remember he was the servant son and we are servant Sons and Daughters can a man impart eternal life a Son of God can oh God let me be a conduit of life let me be an encourager of life let me be a speaker one who speaks life one who speaks a word in season to those that are weary a word in season you say how do you impart life brother BR tells us that they imparted Life by preaching the word we impart life by speaking the word you impart life to your children by telling them about the word speak the word yes yes sir preach the gospel and then go live it yes amen yes yes preaching and if necessary use words that's right to do that you got to be willing to suffer that's right but God is faithful yes the Bible says after you've suffered for a while I'm going to speak to the young people tonight but I I want to tell you this getting old is no joke and I can only speak of that about halfway you know brother Joel told me the other day he said uh he woke up one day and realized he was middle-aged but my daughter told me said Joel I said she was after me to do something she's always after me to do something Esther for the young people and I said you know so you should ask your youth leader ask brother Joel I just thrown it off on him and she said well he thinks he's one of us if you want to do something for God he woke up and realize he was middleaged you don't have only so long on the earth that's right and you've been given the greatest gift that could possibly be given what are we going to do with that what are we going to do with that we going to spend all our time promoting ourselves come on now looking out for what's good for us all right well I want to be that because I'll gain more recognition in the church but what would be best for the church I I want to I want to serve in that way because that would be good and I'm speaking to you because I know at the first of the year we start to think about these things and our deacons and trustees and things like that and how how can I serve God's people we can dispense eternal life by being Christians yeah yes sir by loving people by caring for people and sometimes that means just giving a word of encouragement in due season I'm so thankful that God called me in here to back me up I don't always have to be in the Pulpit but when the man of God gets up and preaches what's he doing he's giving a word to somebody that's weary I was sitting there on Sunday morning sitting in the house too sick to go out and do anything so we watch the service we stream the service and we were sitting there in the house and we're watching the service on Sunday morning and as we're watching the service I begin to feel better because I begin to be encouraged by what brother George was standing here and doing and what he was saying I thought you know what if I was there preaching I couldn't have said it any better I couldn't have said it in a in a better way I just believe God called him to do that at that specific moment and God called brother Stewart to say what he said and God called brother Joel to say what he said what is it we're dispensing eternal life let's take it seriously let's love one another with everything that we've got let's let's give it all of our effort when we come to the house of God we ought to let our attitude be right we ought to pray through before we come we ought to be ready to worship where the preacher or the song leader doesn't have to pump us up but we're ready to worship when we come in the house of God why because we're a Serv of God said my brother Ben I suffer yes we're suffering servants yes and my point was as you grow to be older you'll realize life is suffering it's just what it is you just go from one suffering to another you say well that's depressing but Paul put it this way he said he said if we only have hope in this life we're of all men most miserable all right you don't get very long here sir I think brother Wes you probably realize that better than most of us do this week life is a vapor and it appears for a little while and then it just yeah you're gone what are you going to do with it I made a commitment in my life some musicians want to go ahead and come I kind of run out of steam this morning but I appreciate your prayers made a commitment in my life because I've stood and preached to people and prayed for people who come to be prayed for and they never come to another service I preached to a lady I'll never forget it she's sitting back at the back of the church on the right side I never forget her face she'd come to church off and on had some problems in her marriage she come to church that morning I preached she come to be prayed for I prayed with her the next day I got a phone call her and her husband got in a fight he picked up a gun shot her in the face she never went to another service he said well that couldn't happen it's just the world we live in amen people are broken right he told us he said I didn't know why I did it I didn't want to do it said I love my wife he said I just got so angry let's just let's let's be eternal life amen there may be people here this morning that'll never be in another church service let's be eternal life to them amen Lord if my action toward this person if Me Maybe Just lingering for a little bit at the end of the service and praying and worshipping if I could just put a little bit of effort I know that we're not saved by effort we're saved by the grace of God do you believe that but his grace is so real to me that I want to give every effort I can give to the kingdom of God yes and if just letting the atmosphere be right whether it's me being louder or me being quieter or or me being up the star me not being the star or just sitting in prayer and praying for somebody taking somebody by the hand and reaching out to somebody and being Christ to that person let me be that Lord amen good brother random talks about a dove that was in the first world war he said there was a group of soldiers pinned down and the mustard gas was out and things and they knew they were going to be destroyed in just a little bit longer and the main body soldiers didn't know where they were and so they had to get a message out hey we're surrounded we need help and so he said they sent A A pigeon Dove then they sent it out with a message on its leg he said while it was flying the leg got broke he said it got holes in the wings it was bloody and bleeding he said it finally just had barely had the strength to fall into the camp and when it fell into the camp the people got the message and the ones that were that were that were bound down that were kept down under enemy fire were saved why because a dove had enough oh my had enough about him he was faithful to what he' been called to do what he'd been trained to do and he fell into the camp he said and the great Dove was Jesus Christ when Satan shot everything he get chewed at him and he fell into the camp a wounded dub but he fell into the camp Oh that we would be have that same spirit in us that we may have to fall into the camp we may be wounded but we're willing to be wounded we might be we might be beaten but we're willing to be beaten we might get talked about but we're willing to be talked about just to deliver the message cuz the world needs it you know that girls the world needs what you've got yeah they need it yes everybody you meet needs it let's be life to them you bow your heads with me I don't want us to ever take a service for granted if there's something we can do better we want to do it better I don't want us to ever take a a day for granted we don't know who we might be impacting you don't know in your life who you might impact but the miles sitting back there and the miles seems like he's almost in church by accident but God called him here for a reason and I see brother the miles impacted by the word see his face touched by the word say God May a word in season to one that is weary touch every heart but let me be the conduit of that Lord let me be let me be life to [Music] somebody life to my children I want them so bad to have this eternal life that I have how am I going to get it to them I just got to live it and I got to speak it and believe that what I planted in seed form will Sprout one day and become a reality I wonder if you could just pray with me this morning just say I I've not maybe I've I've not been the the servant that I I should be because my old flesh gets in the way but Lord I want to be I want to be your suffering servant Lord I want to be the one that though everybody talk about me and run me down it don't matter I'll still go to the house of God I'll still take my place though though there may be hardship though there may be toil though there may be struggle but I'll still live for
