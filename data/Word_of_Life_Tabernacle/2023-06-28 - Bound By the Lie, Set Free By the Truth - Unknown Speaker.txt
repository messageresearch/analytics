Satan's Eden Lord I pray for protection over this child Lord I pray his parents would lead him and guide him in every way that they know as long as they can Lord when he's of age I pray that you'd fill him with the Holy Ghost Lord we give him back to you Lord I realize that only his parents can train him and dedicate him to you and the way that he should go but we give him back to you today Lord this great blessing that you've given this family and in fact you said there's no reason [Music] we keep fighting when you'll never win [Music] that's not the end of the story cause the truth says You Shall Overcome and when the facts say you're almost defeated the truth is you've always on your side [Music] [Applause] I want to talk to you about that this morning let's Stand Together you just give me your undivided attention today and we'll try to get through all of this brother Joel's going to speak for us tonight I've just had this message on my heart if I sound a little bit distracted that's why so you just pray for me this morning John chapter 18 and verse 37 John 18-37 it's good to have each one of our visitors with us this morning God bless you and those that are watching we've got a few of them going on vacation as well it says pilate therefore said unto him art thou a king then Jesus answered thou sayest that I am a king to this end was I born and for this cause came I into the world that I should bear witness unto the truth everyone that is of the truth heareth my voice pilate saith unto him what is truth when he had said this he went out again unto the Jews and saith unto them by finding him no fault at all Heavenly Father Lord as we approach your word this morning I ask you Lord to come and move me out of the way take away all of my thoughts Lord and may it be only what you would have for the people this morning Lord maybe there'd be some need represented here that I wouldn't even know about but Lord You've laid this on my heart and maybe it'll address that in some way Lord I know that you're a supernatural God and you use men you choose to do that Lord so I ask you to come in this vessel of clay forgive me Lord if I've done or said anything that would be unlike you Lord where we've missed the mark as a church oh God I pray you'd forgive us today Lord we thank you for your blood we thank you for your mercy we thank you for your love oh God I pray you just move in this in this building this morning Lord I pray for conviction and hearts I pray you'd move Lord and in a miraculous way is only you can or we can't change the minds of people much less their hearts but you can do that Lord and I pray God that you would do it this morning we love you and we thank you and we give you the praise and the glory and the honor in Jesus name amen God bless you you can be seated the creator of all things is the truth if you want to know what the truth is about a flower you should go to the person who created the flower if you want to know what the truth is and I'm talking about the truth I'm not talking about what we can find out scientifically about it but the truth of it then you would go to the one who created it and that Creator is the truth because everything that he created came out of him and so he is the truth about life if you want to know what the truth is about marriage and and how your marriage should go you should go back to the Creator because he's the one who created marriage if you want to know what the truth is about a family you should go back to the the creator of the family and find out what that is and many people today would search many different places for the truth but we believe the truth is not a church the truth is not a Creed the truth is not a Doctrine the truth is a person and that person is Jehovah God who came down in a body of Flesh became flesh and became the word or the truth in our day Jesus self-identified he identified himself as the truth in John 14 6 Jesus said unto him I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me so he's saying I am the truth how many believe that today he is God's expressed truth on the world today now hang with me because we're going somewhere this morning and he is the word the word that come from God took on a body was made flesh and dwelt Among Us John 1 1 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the word verse 14 was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth we find in the scripture that God cannot lie how many believe that today what a comfort that is to us to know brother Joe that God cannot lie it is not that he's mostly true or or he speaks truth most of the time or or even that we believe that he's true but it's actually impossible for God to lie the Bible says God is not a man that he should lie he is not a man that he should lie neither the son of man that he should repent hath he said and shall he not do it hath he spoken shall he not make it good if he said something about you if he's got something in his word that's about you he's going to make it good he's going to make it come to pass he's going to make it what it says it will be there is no word that returns to him void oh that ought to give us great comfort today and peace and knowing that God takes care of his word he guards his word he is the truth and it doesn't matter what I say about it or what somebody else says about it he's the truth he will always be true I may make a mistake he doesn't make any mistakes I I may I may fall and fail but he don't fall and he don't fail he is the truth the way the truth and the life he is the truth he said well how where will I find him how can I know where the truth is he came down and dwelt Among Us and he was the word and he is the word today so we can say the word is the truth how many believe that today so it's impossible for God to lie it's a great concept so now he is the truth his children tell the truth he's so much the truth that when you're born again you don't lie anymore that's what the Bible says it says lie not one to another seeing you have put off the old man with his deeds so you've actually when you are filled with the spirit of God you are actually so much you've been filled with the truth and so much so that you can't even lie to your brother or your sister so when you lie you know we weren't made to lie because we're made in the image of God that's why a lie detector works the way that it does when you lie you you're nervous when you lie when you're telling a lie there's something about your body that Rebels against a lie because the life and that's the reason when people go the directions that they go and and I have great pity for people today they're telling oh you can be whatever you want to be but if you if the truth is that you're a man then the LIE is you can be whatever you want to be but the truth is you're a man right and then when you lie against the truth it creates depression it creates struggle right and that's why so many people deal with with all these things and you wonder why is there a mental health crisis today why because there's lies against the truth true now now look God's creation of us is the truth and every other word is a lie so when we lie we break the image of Truth right now brother Branham talks about a lie detector he said it's the vibration of your nerves that they pick up on a lie detector it'll tell you he said man was not made to lie in his original beginning remember that man was not made to lie in his original beginning but the word says because the word is the truth are you with me now so now so now there's a there's a lie that comes on it puts you in a sort of bondage because you were made to lie now we know that Satan was identified as a liar in John 8 44 he says you're of your father the devil and the lust of your father you will do he was a murderer from the beginning and Abode not in the truth because there is no truth in him so the reason that he lied is because he can't do anything else right so how do you know the devil's lying the same way you know that a lawyer is lying no that's not exactly true when he opens his mouth right you know the devil's lying when he opens his mouth right but the word is always true now so he's a liar when he said when he speaks it's a lie he speaketh of his own I'm trying not to skip too far ahead here when the devil speaks a lie he speaks of his own so when God speaks the truth who's he's speaking of right so now what Satan's lie was in the beginning almost true but it was yet it had an element of untruth and I'm just building a foundation here so we can get where we want to go this morning but in Genesis 3 4 the serpent said to the woman you shall not surely die so it was the truth with an added word right so he added one word to God's true and made it alive the worst lies are mostly true because those are the ones that are deceptive but the brown said every lie has got a lot of Truth in it he said that's right if it's a real lie he said what we call a black lie or a little white lie I said The Little White Lies the real life he said you can see the big black lives but it's that little white one that Scott he said like the one the devil told Eve just one little thing off cater he said that's what our churches are listening to today now now just you know even in our own lives we need to be careful to tell the truth and not just a version of the truth we need to be truthful with each other even if it hurts even if we need to be truthful now there's times you don't have to say anything at all but don't lie because telling a lie even if it's insignificant you're sinning against the image of God you were created in the image of God Don't Lie and I'll say this don't accept lies don't accept lies if you know that the Bible says one thing and you accept something else because someone else said it then you've accepted a lie against the truth and you actually drive yourself far from the image of God by doing that are you with me so far so that's what the churches are listening to today they're saying oh you're right in your principle of baptism you're right in this you're right in that so they can agree on this that and the other he said but if he fails to let you know that you got to have love for your brother out there all right the devil wants to get you all so true that you have Holy Ghost meetings and and you have things going on and powers of God and things moving but all he wants to do is is maybe get you to not have the love for your brother breach right that's the lie in the truth that's just one example there's many but though he's right or wrong he said stand shoulders within the kingdom of God in the presence of God and by the way that's one of the evidences of Lies when someone believes a lie they tend to disfellowship and tend to separate Brotherhood over that life it's the first one of the first marks of false Doctrine they separate themselves from the church right from the body of Believers why they believed a lie and my heart goes out to them I know these people that believe this stuff against brother Branham and and they come up with all kinds of stuff on the internet and the first of all what do they do they separate themselves from the body of Believers and they don't discuss it with their Pastor many times they don't talk to somebody who would know about it in the church but they actually they'll go to the weakest member or somebody who's backslid or or somebody who used to believe it and they'll talk to them about it why because they they're separating themselves they're they're making themselves uh because they realize the devil's so deceptive he wants you to believe a lion he's bringing that to you and like I said I feel bad for them and I wouldn't say that a person like that necessarily is blasphemed although you've got to be careful speaking against the truth but Satan has deluded them and maybe they've been through something and they've had bad things happen to them but remember the truth will always be true and in your heart you know it's the truth that's why you fight against it like you do yes many people know this message is true but they but they come up against it not because it's not true but because it's hard but in the end it'd be easier if you just go with the truth you teach your children that don't you so even a white lie matters brother Brandon taught us I don't have time to bring all the quotes this morning but instead of you say well don't condemn me to tell a little white lie he said it's because you ain't got nothing to condemn he said that don't hurt my conscience he said you got no more conscience and a snake has hips that's a Kentucky way of saying it but don't bother me to tell a little white lie it ought to maybe you got so used to it you just need to come back and repent make sure what you're saying is the truth the Bible tells us finally Brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report if there be any virtue if there be any praise think on these things because that's the truth now so we've established that God can't lie are you with me on that I know this you say well this brother really basic brother Ben but we're going somewhere God can't lie the devil can't tell the truth right there will always be a lie in it yeah if it's the devil telling it so God can't lie the devil can't tell the truth so Jesus tells the Jews when he when the Jews come to him and some of them started to believe on him and he tells them that he speaks to them about a lie how it keeps them in bondage but yet the truth would be freedom in John 8 31 then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him if you continue in my word then are you my disciples indeed the Bible says in one place Jesus didn't associate with everybody that believed on him because he knew their hearts he knew who they were he knew whether they were the elected of God or not so he knew that many of them would not continue so now he goes on he says and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free so he identifies a lie as bondage right and the truth shall make you free you remember we watched you're no longer deep close to the deep but there's another 20th century Prophet if you've ever seen that video I'm sure most of you have but Branham speaks to a woman on that video who has been told a lie how many have seen that go and watch it 20th century Prophet it's on YouTube it's on the voice of God website or other websites you can go to 20th century prophet and and if you go there and you begin to watch that you see this woman has been lied to and they told her she was a witch now she should have known if she was a witch but they made her believe that she was a witch right because it was people she respected God help us today we need to be careful what we tell people right because people she respected brother Justin told her a lie about herself some of you are struggling today because people you respected maybe a parent maybe an aunt or an uncle maybe a pastor somebody told you a lie and you're still believing that even though you know it's not true I told you you'd never make it they told you you weren't good enough they told you there's too much going on in your life for you to make it and because of that lie it affects you brings a cloud of you but you remember what happened to the woman when a prophet came and revealed the secret of the heart the word amen the word revealed the truth and the lie was a bondage but the truth was delivered amen all week long you hear the lies all week long you hear you're not good enough all week long the devil speaks to you and tells you that you're not going to make it but on Sunday and on Wednesday and every time you turn on a tape listen to it all right now he said the truth will make you free you'll know the truth the truth will make you free and they didn't like it they took umbrage to that they said well we've never been in bondage to any man how say it so you should be made free we're free men they were proud of that fact they were not slaves today we might say we're message believers we have a prophet I was raised in church I'm a Christ follower you might say I'm a Believer but the truth will make you free it's one thing to say I'm a Believer but brother Brown tells us in the token that's not enough not enough just to go to church it's not enough though that's what you're supposed to do but that's not enough but you've got to be you've got to have Christ Within You by the power of the Holy Ghost listen you know the truth the truth makes you free whenever you find yourself doing something because somebody else teaches it and you know it's not true they can't back it up with the word but you're in a system what you are is you're under the LIE no matter how many good people are in the system no matter how much they they might preach and they might they might be eloquent or they might have signs and wonders and gifts but yet if you're under that system that keeps you from holy following the word you're believing the LIE are you with me so far this morning now they didn't like that so how are you saying we'll be made free we're believers and Jesus answered them verily verily I say unto you whosoever commit a sin is the servant of sin the servant abide is not in the house forever but the son abide is forever if the son therefore shall make you free you should be free indeed so he said truth is not what you believe about yourself truth is not a group that you identify with truth is not I go to brother Ben's Church are you with me this morning but the truth will make you free truth is a person the truth is Jesus Christ amen so the lie that binds is the same lie that was told at the beginning we know brother Brown calls it the life in second Thessalonians 2 7 it talks about the uh one that's coming the Antichrist system that's coming he said for the mystery of iniquity doth already work only he who now letteth will let until he be taken out of the way and then shall that Wicked be revealed whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming even him who's coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish because they receive not what the love of the truth they receive not the love of the truth they lost their first love and that was the what the Ephesian Church did but the Rams said they lost their love for gospel meetings they received not the love of the truth that they might be saved so truth must be loved or it will be rejected in favor of a lie and brother Brown teaches us you must reject truth to believe a lie so so the devil is a liar God is the truth you got to tell the truth if you're children of God children of God tell the truth Children of the devil live a lie right truth must be loved or it will be rejected in favor of a lie so you've got to reject truth to believe a lie and you reject the lie to believe the truth second Thessalonians 2 11 for this cause God shall send them strong delusion that they should believe a lie but the Brown says in the original that's the LIE he said that they all might be damned who believe not the truth bad pleasure in the righteousness he said it should be translated the lie not Eli the same one he told Eve he said the lie that Satan told Eve was 90 truth and the lie that you can tell he said how I've heard men bypass pieces in the scripture just to keep from it hurts their theology but if this part's right that part's right let's put it together make it fit through the whole Bible so again he says that's the way that the unbeliever the unidentified person with God he'll say oh I believe Jesus Christ is the Son of God I believe God is the father of Jesus Christ I believe these other things but when it comes down to this other part oh that's for another day see there's the LIE of it that's right he's trying to twist a little of the right word around to make it deceiving for the people but what Jesus made the thing clear he said these signs shall confirm the message that I have sent it not for another day now when Adam and Eve again he said that when Adam and Eve listen to the LIE of the devil the holy image of God left them the holy image of God left them you know what happened when the Holy image of God left them they didn't want to be in church no more that's what happened when people start to believe a lie they start hanging out away from believers it's just the truth now the holy image of God left them they were more comfortable with other with unbelievers maybe if you could say it that way than believers their fellowship with God was broken where he used to come down in the cool of the evening and and be their God and talk to them and have a little church service they're in the trees and now their Fellowship of Oneness was broken brother brother said their Fellowship was broken with God their Fellowship of Oneness with God was broken the very minute they listened to the LIE of the devil that broke their fellowship and the very minute that you listened to the LIE of the devil it'll break your fellowship that's the very minute that you go out from the presence of God like she did it's when you failed to take God's word just as it is so now look I want to ask you something we all know there's a God and if God is so correct with his word and so determined he'll judge the people by his word then he's got to preserve a word somewhere to judge the people by God didn't just write the word he preserves the word so that even a fool would marry therein hey man he preserved the word to judge people by the by this Bible is it he said don't you forget that it's the Bible that God will judge the people by verse said in revelation 22 he either will take one word away from it or add one word to it see not just say well I go to church I believe I believe God why every devil in hell believes him every one of them is religious everyone but it just takes one word that breaks the fellowship right there a chain that's no stronger than its weakest link and where your weakness is on disbelieving God's word now listen this will help you he said there's where you want to put a new link yeah strong with the rest of it so if there's a link that's that's weak and that link maybe is what your parents told you yeah or what's your what's your old what somebody else told you an old system a denominational system you need to take that link yeah throw it away and replace that leak with the truth God loves me that thought that tells you the pastor don't love you the people don't love you take that link and throw it away that leak is weak because it's not right with the word take that leak and replace it with I know I'm a Child of God I know I'm one of Gods put that link back in the chain why because that chain is is what's holding you oh my I'm so glad for God's word it holds us where we ought to be or we don't go where the unbeliever goes now look he said if you believe Jesus Christ saves then you must put a link in there that believes he heals right you're strong in Salvation but you're weak in healing it's the same atonement right but Timothy you believe for your salvation then that chain also has healing in it but if there is if there's a weak link there and healing belief for your healing right replace that chain replace that link if you believe he was you must believe he is amen you got a strong faith to believe he was he was the god that walked in flesh he was the god that was with brother random but do you believe he is right you've got to have uh that that chain is only as strong as this week it's like he's the same yesterday today and forever if you believe he was and wondering whether he is that leak will break and then you're lost so we know we must know the truth to be free and we must know the truth in other words know what the truth is but to be able to distinguish the truth from the LIE and I would say this this morning I almost hesitate to ask this because you don't want people to start questioning but I don't want to minister questions to you but just to make a point of where I'm going how do you know that I'm telling you the truth right there's got to be some way how do you know that I'm telling you the truth the Bible says you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free so he didn't say you'll guess at it you wouldn't say you you'll go with it because brother Ben said sober the Ben's my brother my my uncle my my grandpa I hope there's no grandchildren that's what I feel like anymore but whatever brother Ben is to you or brother Ben believes it must be right you don't know it's the truth you think it's the truth all right well the church teacher said I went to church there for 30 years they teach it that mean it's the truth how do you know the truth you know the truth it's the word you won't guess at it but you know the truth but what how does the word come to you how does it come to you see you can even read the scripture and not know the truth you can listen to tapes and not know the truth you can hear me preach and not know the truth right right now how is that because the word has to come by spiritual revelation right Sunday school class participation this morning how do you know the truth about spiritual Revelation how did Peter know who Jesus was only one way he could know Jesus answered and said to him blessed art thou Simon barjona for Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven Hallelujah but the prayer says the whole Bible is the revelation of God the whole church is built upon the revelation of God there is no other way to know God Only by Revelation to whom the son will reveal him Revelation everything is revelation he said so not to accept the Revelation he said to to not accept the Revelation then you're just a cold theologian and there is no hope for you that's a strong statement you've got to accept revelation and so it's the Holy Ghost so we got to get people the Holy Ghost don't we we need our children to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost we want the Holy Ghost to be present in our services because it's the holy ghost that teaches the truth the letter kills but the spirit gives life the Holy Ghost will lead you as an individual to the person of Christ the truth John 14 and 17 even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it sees him not neither knoweth him but you know him how do you know the spirit of Truth he dwelleth with you and shall be in you but when the comforter has come down 15 26 whom I was sending you from the father even the spirit of Truth which proceedeth from the father he will testify of Me John 16-13 how be it when he the spirit of Truth has come he will guide you into how much all truth amen he will guide you into all Truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come you don't know that I'm telling you the truth unless you have the Holy Ghost you may believe that I am you may think that I am but it's got to be by the Holy Ghost to give you confidence in the word because otherwise you say well I I'll take the Bible and I'll prove whether you tell me the truth or not well it depends on how you believe the Bible you believe what a prophet said or do you believe what the Baptist said or the Methodist or whatever and again I'm not condemning those things it's just you've got to believe something what are you going to believe God you got to believe the truth so you need the Holy Ghost to reveal truth to you oh my God oh my now now God does use men but the Holy Ghost is the teacher of Truth the man is God's microphone that God uses to teach the truth but it's the Holy Ghost itself that makes the truth real to the person you understand which makes every individual continued with us but they went out that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us but gee have an unction that word is anointing you have an anointing from the Holy One and you know all things you he's writing to a bunch of holy ghost-filled people and he said you know all things so it was necessary for John to write but he's saying the spirit is telling you this is the truth oh we've got to have that church you have an unction for the Holy One and you know all things he said I have not written unto you because you know not the truth but because you know it so the scripture was not written for the one that didn't know the truth but for the one who knew it oh my and that no lie is of the truth oh my who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ right this whole this whole belief system is built on a lie he is Antichrist that denies the father and the son there were some in that day that were saying that the sun didn't actually exist that it was just a spiritual thing so the the gnostics of that day he said that's an antichrist it denies the father and the son whosoever denyth the son the same hath not the father but he that acknowledges the son hath the father also verse 24 let that therefore abide in you now watch let that therefore abide in you which you have heard from the beginning because everything God ever said won't change I just wish we could we could just dwell on that we could think about that for a minute everything God ever said won't change he can't he can't do that and be God right what you've heard from the beginning let it abide in you so when you have from the beginning something it continues and it continues and it continues it's the truth it's the truth and one day well it's not true what's happening you're listening to a lie because the truth will always be true if it's a lie now it was a lie to begin with so don't let Satan try to shake your faith what you've heard from the beginning if that he said if that which you have heard from the beginning shall remain in you you shall also continue in the Son and the father and this is the promise that he hath promised us even eternal life he said these things have I written unto you concerning them that seduce you he said brother Ben I'm scared I'm scared I'm going to be I'm going to be deceived but he told us that the bride would not be deceived why because you have the truth can I go a little bit farther your flesh of his flesh bone of his bones power of his power what does that mean you are the truth [Music] we need to get away from this fear and scare the brother Bradham talked about the constant beating people over the head well you may not make it you may not make it every day they're on pins and needles wondering if they're going to make it that's not what this message was built on this message is built on insurance it's built on faith we have the Holy Ghost of Bible said with much assurance we know whom in whom we have believed Paul said I know in whom I believe they may put me in jail but I know whom I have believed it they may put me in prison they may drop my head off but I know in whom I have believed it and I'm persuaded that he's able to keep that which I've committed unto him against that day I'm persuaded of it I know it I know the truth not to constantly worry about well oh my if I listen to anybody else I'm going to be deceived no you'll know what to reject yeah why because the Holy Spirit is in you but the holy spirit's not in you then you have to worry now watch it's about the anointing which you have received of him abideth in you and you need not that any man teach you but as the same anointing teaches you of all things in his truth and it is no lie and even as it has taught you even as it hath past tense taught you you shall abide in him so the truth says you know this is the way a woman should act and this is the way a man should act this is I mean this day this is this should be a man this should be a woman but the LIE says you can be whatever you want to be right that's an extreme virtual it's not so extreme today our kids deal with that somebody's got to deal with it from the pulpit they deal with that it's the LIE the same lie that Satan told Eve it's a lie they try to tell them well you you can you can you can be whatever you want to be and you can this this but this anointing teaches you all things so if you get the Holy Ghost you'll know that's a lie right that's a lie I believe though God's word is true we can take that in many other areas of our life now many people have said well since Jesus is the truth I will only follow those things written in red have you ever heard you ever met anybody that said that I only believe what's written in red well they're still deceived because that's not what the truth said the truth said written in red if you believe Moses you believe me right so the truth testified that the entire Bible is the truth all right so they're still deceived others will say well to in order to make sure that I'm only hearing the truth I'll only hear a certain preacher I only hear my pastor but they're still deceived because the Bible says that to edify the church he'd send five different gifts right Pastor Apostle Prophet Pastor evangelist teacher right that's what the Bible says but this will only hear a certain one but they're still deceived others will say I will only hear a prophet still deceived because that's not what the truth said right it's not the truth we heard from the beginning Paul says it this way he said the things that thou has heard of me among many witnesses the same commit doubt of Faithful Men Who should be able to teach others also because the Brown says this he said you must come under teaching you must come under teaching you say I don't need no one to teach me after the Holy Ghost has come my friends he said that just gives me a little room to doubt whether you've really got it or not come on he said the way you're acting with it see the thing you're doing he said no if the Bible says the holy spirit is the teacher why does the Holy Spirit put teachers in the church then to set the church in order the same Holy Spirit he said we don't need any seminaries to go around big bunch of men to look out these things the holy spirit is a teacher see it's a teacher and it gives some fellow a gift to teaching and then you must be subject to that gift but how do you know he's telling you the truth by the same Holy Ghost by the same Holy Ghost the preacher is preaching with us the same way you know it's the truth Philip when he goes down and I won't get into this this morning but he goes down to the eunuch you know the story and he said do you understand what you're reading unit says how can I unless some men some men guide me right but when the unit caught the revelation he needed a revelation so how now he had the scriptures and then he had the teaching of Philip the evangelist who is not even a prophet but he was an evangelist but he come to him and he taught him those things and then once he taught him he still needed Revelation but when the Revelation struck his heart he said here is water and when the Revelation strikes your heart you'll run quickly to water baptism in Jesus name why because not because I told you so but because the Revelation struck your heart you have the anointing now you can sit this is going to get hard but then it gets better are you still with me this morning you could sit under perfect and be lost what's that brother Ben how do you know that Judas did the devil had access to his mind you say I'm only going to hear Jesus Judas only heard Jesus for three and a half years that was his teacher his Prophet his his mentor his God or so he professed with the others right but he did he didn't put into action what he heard brother said he can do everything else but he couldn't receive the Holy Ghost right and but what what does the devil still have access to In Spite of perfect teaching your mind you don't believe the devil's floating around out here so I'm not gonna let any man Teach me the devil loves that right because what is he going to do he's going to come in and start talking to you himself he does that that's what he does he'd been talking to all of us since we were born almost since we're old enough to understand he comes in he's the most faithful member of the church right he comes everywhere there's people he comes with you at your house he tells you you're not worthy he tells you you're not good enough he tells you you're not going to make it he tells you that the blood is not sufficient he tells you that you're not going to be healed why does he talks to you all the time doesn't he you need to hear another voice speaking to you you need to sit under teaching come under teaching and hear a voice telling you are going to make it you are the Bride of Jesus Christ because the devil sitting on his shoulder all the time telling you you're not so well I'll only read my Bible because that'll make me where I can where I can only hear the truth and the devil will take it and pervert it to you what did the Bible say the Bible says supper being ended the devil having now put into the heart yeah of Judas Iscariot to betray him see your mind's accept accessible the Enemy No matter how perfect the truth is that you're hearing because the mind is no man's land but the brown said the human mind was chosen for the place of the battle you know where the term no man's land come from that was from the first world war when they would have entrench Warfare and the technology had gone faster than the tactics did and the technology was such that they could mow down men with machine guns and they were still charging with just men running across no man's land and so they stayed there for years and in between was no man saying where the mustard gas had killed everything it was just just holes and and everything else brother Brown said that was the mind right that's the Battleground and the thing is it's going to happen you can't keep that from happening you can't keep them from coming in but you can shoot him out you got a contest to No Man's Land because if you don't Contest no man said he'll come in your territory he'll make you believe you're not even a Christian you've got to contest that thought when it comes up against you the Bible says cast it down every stronghold every idea that exalts itself against the knowledge of Christ against the truth so there's a Battleground going on and many times we are in bondage because of misunderstandings in that Battleground now brother Branham had a dream you remember the dream brother Brandon had a dream and it was a dream about about some people that were bound and they said this is the house of hell remember that woman that he knew come up to him and she said Deliver Us from this place delivereth from this house of hell delivers from this place and she said this is a house of hell but when they come to him and she come to him she said something interesting and I was talking about this the other day with a with another Minister and he brought this to my attention and it just kind of fit with what I was studying but look at this it says you you've been misunderstood you've been misunderstood now watch you've been misunderstood and you misunderstood these people too yeah and we know brother Ben told us when he misunderstood the people was when he called him Ricky's and rickettos the Holy Spirit told him not to do that he said their children they may be children of God Bound in those denominational houses of hell yeah all right they might be bound in that but they're children of God still right and so you don't mistreat them you don't you don't say that about them because it may be a child of God so but how did the people misunderstand brother Branham now think about it however it was maybe they you know how people usually misunderstand they misunderstand like like John did when he got himself put in prison and he found himself in prison I believe brother Andrew preached that here or maybe somewhere else that I heard him preach that bill Andrew Glover preached that John in prison misunderstood Jesus he said are you the one are you looking for another should we look for another he misunderstood because Jesus didn't meet his expectations how many of us have misunderstood the message because it didn't meet our expectations because we had a preconceived idea what the message was and what it ought to be many times people misunderstand the message because people because preachers yeah people misunderstand brother Branham because preachers have misled them right people misunderstand the message because preachers people misunderstand the message because people don't live right oh God but see they got their eyes on the wrong thing you can't get your eyes that's the LIE get your eyes on the truth if you don't get your eyes on the truth you'll stay bound you'll stay in that house of Hell you'll stay behind those bars they were Bound by misunderstanding but they were delivered by the name of Jesus Christ he said how will I deliver these people I haven't got enough strength in my arms to break those bars so I said House of Hell give way to the name of Jesus Christ and all the creaking and popping and rocks rolling and bars falling and people running sound like a Pentecostal meeting doesn't it screaming delivered and they're screaming at the top of their voice was all delivered why because of prophet of God said the truth spoke the truth what was it the truth is not a Doctrine the truth is a person the name of Jesus Christ so a misunderstanding put on Behind Bars but truth delivered them yes God now remember I said the enemy has a right to your mind but remember this the elect cannot be deceived brother said to believe the devil's lies to serve Satan even though you want to may want to call him Jehovah but the elect will not that's why I don't have to disfellowship you because you're a little bit different than me and always fighting fuss with somebody why would I do that the elect will not be deceived if I treat people right and believe the truth and preach the truth it'll come out all right the elect will not be deceived I don't have to control you to make you not deceived I hope you hear me today the truth is still the truth you may have been taught all your life that you had to hear a certain preacher or send under a certain Pastor in order to make it but I'm here to tell you today you know the truth and the truth will set you free I don't have to control you I don't have to make you my servants because then you just become the servants to a man I don't have to control your behavior I don't have to tell you what time to pray or what time to listen to The Prophet or what time to do anything else I don't have to do that why don't I have to do that you have the Holy Ghost you have the anointing and the truth will set you free you are not in the denominational system anymore why would we go back to that furthermore the elect will not only be kept I love that the elect will not only be kept but as this move becomes the image director to the Beast the Saints will be gone in the Rapture aren't you glad for that this morning brother tells this little Eagle story he says that after you recognize the very word of God was Eagle food you said you left the other thing watch you left the other thing now watch you remember the eagle story The the farmer had put an eagle egg under the hen but the mother Eagle knew she had more than one egg right and so she goes down looking for it when she goes looking for it then one day one day the little Eagle hears something that that he he's never heard with his ears but it it makes sense to him it's him in mature form right he is it's like that's it's me Mama it's me like a little boy looking in the mirror and so now he he recognizes the Cry of the eagle but the brother said after you recognize the very word of God with evil food you left the other thing you have been informed into the living image of the Living God now listen to me you heard from your theophany huh you heard from your theophany if this Earthly body be dissolved we have one waiting now a theophany is a word body it's not as difficult as what it's a Greek word so it makes it sound difficult but a theophany is just a word body right It's let's just say it like this Jesus was the thoughts of God expressed on the earth as the son of God whatever God thought about his son was what Jesus was and that was all that he was right all within God was poured into Christ but it's those collected thoughts of God so you are there is a you if I can say it that way that is the collected thoughts the entirety of what God thought about you before you were born before even Jesus died on the cross before there was ever a world before there was a devil right there was a you right and that is your theophany it's what God says about you can we say it this way it's your truth now we hear that a lot today this is my truth right but if your truth is a theophany it was in the mind of God before the foundation of the world it is what God said about you so your truth oh God you all may know this I I've been saying this this week and tying that to the truth and it just blessed my heart so much I said God that means it's the truth that you thought about me that is the truth of who I am and everything else is alive [Music] listen a theophany a word body and now but the rest of the difference between him and you he was the word and but you he said you're a son he was a son you're a son he said see he was at the beginning the word and in morphe body he came in and lived in that in the person of Melchizedek and then later we never heard no more melchized today because he became Jesus Christ Melchizedek was the priest but he became Jesus Christ he said now you bypass that because in that form he knew all things and you have never been able to know that yet I love that part of the joke you've never been able to know that yeah he knew all things what are all things the truth you could believe a lie because you didn't have access to all the truth do you know that because people believed you couldn't go but about 30 miles an hour because they've never seen it done but when somebody did it that was the truth are you with me now now they go faster than the speed of sound why are they able to do that it's become the truth but it was all it was the truth all the time they just didn't know it he knew all things but you don't know all things yet some of us seem to turn around just apply that to ourselves right now Lord I'm going through a problem but I don't know all things yet Lord I don't understand why the preachers preaching what he's preaching but I don't know all things yet Lord I don't understand why you even still have preachers but I don't know all things yet Lord I don't understand why I have this sickness in my body but I don't know all things yet but I know you know Lord I don't know why I was raised like I was raised I don't know what about my family history I don't know a lot of things but I know the truth is you I know you are the truth I don't know all things yet he said you come like Adam like me you became from the attribute to the flesh to be tempted so those collected thoughts of God the thoughts that he had about you that was called an attribute so it come from the attribute the attribute it's just who God was right in God was your theophany [Music] that's why you identify with the word everybody wants to identify themselves today but you identify with the word That's why nothing else will move you but the word why because the word is who you are that's why you're a message believer not because your parents were not because somebody else was not because somebody taught you something a belief system but because the word image in heaven is who you are you come from the attribute to the flesh to be tempted but when this life is finished here this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have one someone say already waiting what is that a word body yeah right that's where we go yeah I just love this huh that is the word some of y'all need to need to have some confidence in the word how can we hear this and still live the same as we do how can we know this and still worship the way that we do to know that An Almighty God and all sufficient God told us that we were a part of him and where we go is is the word he said then we can look back and see what we've done now watch when will you know all things we can look back and see what we've done he said now we don't understand it oh God but we have never become the word we've just become the flesh man not the word but look he said clearly it makes it clear you will never be the word unless you was a thought at the beginning that proves the predestination of God you can't be the word unless you're a thought you had to be in the thinking first you were an eagle to begin with but watch just as Jesus was the truth about the father he say I am the way the truth and the life your word body theophany is the truth about you sir see and that's why you can say that the voice that you heard was in a man's voice now watch he said you heard from your theophany you didn't hear from a man you heard from your theophany right he said brother Brown said this about his own message we need to understand the power of this word he says I wasn't the one that appeared down on the river I was only standing there when he appeared I'm not the one that performs these things for tells these things that happens as perfect as they are I'm the only one that's near when he does it I was only a voice that he used to say it it wasn't what I knew because brother Branham didn't know all things he came the same way we did he didn't buy passes he bypassed his word body like we did right but he was a prophet yeah so he had thus saith the Lord and when the word come to the prophet he said it wasn't what I knew it's what I surrendered myself to that he spoke through it was it isn't me it wasn't the seventh angel oh no it was the manifestation of the son of man it wasn't the angel his message it was the mystery that God unfolded it's not a man it's God the angel was not the son of man he was the messenger from the son of man the son of man is Christ he is the one that you're feeding on you're not feeding on a man his words will fail his words may not be true listen his words will fail but you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man when God spoke through a prophet's lips it became the body of the word [Applause] [Music] and when the body of oh my you've heard from the word you didn't hear from me some of your first second third fourth fifth generation message believers you've been message Believers all your life some of you but are you feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man why are you message believers how do you know you're hearing the truth well the anointing has to be in you and when it is it don't matter what the truth comes from what what body it comes from you've heard from your theophany not from not from a man [Music] oh God and so what I'm doing brother Danny I know that I did certain things right are you still with me this morning I've gone way too long already actually that clock's not working I got all day I know certain things about myself right I know at what age that I grew up I know what mistakes I made I know everything about me yeah the things I remember anyway some of them I may remember right or not right because memory is not perfect right but but some of the things I may misremember I may remember hopefully maybe in a different way than someone else would remember it but I know about me I probably know more about me than you do because I lived in this body all right I know about me that's why he said brother Ben somebody call you names okay you know they can't call me any worse than what I was I can't say anything worse about me than what I've done I was a sinner right are you with me I said well what did you do brother Ben I was a sinner all right that just makes me that's just what I was now so I know about me but I'd but I didn't know about the real me [Applause] so a mighty angel came down in Revelation 10 because he had to have a bride at the end time that knew who they were because they were going to go get a word body there had to be somebody who heard from their theophany so a mighty Angel come down and opened up the book and he began to read and began to open up the book to us and he come through a prophet and begin to preach to us and begin to tell us these things and as he told us he told us about an eagle story and what did it do something inside of you said that's me he told us about broken sisters and you said I was in those broken sisters but now I'm in that well of Living Water he told you about marriage and divorce and you knew what the truth was he told you what were you learning you were not learning just the truth about a book you were learning the truth about you you could say brother Joel you could say I was in Hot Springs I was in Nevada I live in Hardy now that's the truth about me but it's really the LIE the truth about you is you're a Son of God but for the foundation of the world and the devil can't take that away from you the truth is you're not forsaken the truth is you can't be denied amen you know feeding on a man feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man the truth and you learn the truth about you as you feed on the word you're becoming that truth now pilate pilate asked him he said what is the truth what is truth a pilot with hearing his words he said right in front of him so what's truth what is truth Jesus didn't go into a full explanation but look what is truth the truth about is still on the truth about Pilate is that is that pilate was not the elect now that's hard for some of us to take but it's the truth that's the truth the truth is pilate would never receive it now he he knew who Jesus was he knew that Jesus was not a sinner right there's people who know what this message is they know that brother Branham was a prophet I think pilate believed that Jesus was probably a prophet pilate knew that there was nothing against him but he could not stand the test of politics why could he not stand the test of politics because the truth he did not love the truth he only stood in front of the truth and heard the truth but he wasn't the truth are you with me now so he heard his words but he never came to his words he ended up committing suicide because he couldn't handle what he had done he knew what he did was wrong he knew the message was right but he could not receive it oh God but listen there's a truth there was people who had truth now look there was a woman in psychar in the city of psycho and Samaria and in that City the men of that City thought they knew the truth about that woman the women of that City thought they knew the truth about that woman they said the truth is she's a prostitute the truth is she'd been married five times and the one she's been married to now is not her husband but listen when the when the one when the word came down and began to speak to her the son of man began to reveal her heart first it told her the truth about what she was but then she realized if you know amen yeah if you know what I've done and who I am then you know all about me you know what I was before I ever made a sin before I ever made a mistake before I ever committed a sin before I ever committed adultery she said if you know what I did you know what I didn't do you know what I was before I did it I mean a psycho I thought they knew the truth but the true life she lived was to lie and Jesus was the truth because of that they had been bound by the lies she had been bound by the LIE but when she heard the truth she was set free the men who caught the woman in the act of adultery knew the truth about that woman the Bible said they caught her in the very Act they knew the truth about what she had done oh God but Jesus knew a truth beyond what they knew yeah he knew a truth that she didn't even know right aren't you glad he knew things about you that you didn't know because he knew that I would be a Christian he knew that I would be a believer he knew that I would love the message I didn't know that I didn't come into the world knowing that but he knew it and so he knew that she would believe he knew he didn't just go to everybody they probably stoned many women yeah for adultery but here was one woman who was the elect of God and Jesus had a need to go by her way when he went by her way here she was they dragged him in front of her and said what do we do with her and he said he who commits without sin commit the first son because he knew the truth about all of them laughs he knew the truth about all of them and from the oldest Who had most the most sense to the youngest they'll turn and walked off and Jesus is standing in the middle mid middle of a circle of dropped stones he looks up he writes something in the sand he looks up he says woman where are your accusers oh God you know you can fight with the truth but you might as well just believe it she could have sat there and said well they caught me what did she say nobody they all left where are your accusers they all left what does the Bible say there is therefore now no condemnation of them were in Christ Jesus they walked not after the flesh after the spirit we found out last week that condemnation was verdict there is no verdict you may still feel the shame of it but there's no verdict against you there's no condemnation there's no verdict there was no verdict against her because the accusers had cast been cast down they were bound but she was free at the time Jesus was crucified pilate was bound by the lion closing go ahead and musicians go ahead and come at the time Jesus was crucified pilate was bound by the LIE the Pharisees were Bound by the LIE the people who cried crucified were Bound by the LIE but the thief on the cross was set free by the truth what was it they heard from their word body they heard from their word body they heard the truth about themselves the Bible says let every man's word be a lie and gods be true I've heard what the people have to say I've heard what they have to say on Facebook I know what God Said how many say Amen to that today I know what God said about me and that is the truth would you bow your heads with me are you bound this morning are you free the truth shall set you free you will know the truth and the truth will make you free why live under bondage what's the point of that you say well maybe I'll somehow punish myself for what I've done long enough that then I can be delivered from it no amount of punishments you ever do to yourself will ever deliver you from the LIE only the truth can deliver you from the LIE you can't make yourself believe something because somebody said it any man on this Earth that spoke it I would have doubted it but God said I didn't just hear from the angel that lightened the Earth in Revelation 18 but I heard from The Voice from Heaven I had to hear the teacher on the earth the prophet on the Earth but I also had to hear a voice from heaven said come out of her my people this is the truth the truth is you know within yourself the truth you know it you if you have the Holy Ghost you know it why don't you let it be true let every man's word be a lie and God's word be true the truth has set us free free from worry free from Fear free to worship if there's something that

something maybe that you're doing you know better yeah yet you realize that you're doing it maybe you can't even stop it but he can help you today he's the truth maybe you believe lies about yourself all all the things and they were True Lies if we could say it that way lives that seem to you to be true and you were the one who did it but it's still alive because it's not what the word said about
