[51:55] that'll help me make it through the week
[51:58] because we need him we can't make it
[52:00] without him Ruth chapter 1 and verse one
[52:02] now it came to pass in the days when the
[52:04] judges ruled there was a famine in the
[52:07] land and a certain man of Bethlehem
[52:10] Judah went to sour in the country of
[52:12] Moab he and his wife and his two sons
[52:16] and the name of the man was IMC and the
[52:19] name of his wife Naomi and the name of
[52:21] his two sons Maan and chilon Ides of
[52:25] Beth beem Judah and they came into the
[52:27] country of Moab and continued there and
[52:31] IMC Naomi's husband died and she was
[52:34] left and her two sons and they took them
[52:36] wives of the women of Moab the name of
[52:39] the one was orpa the name of the other
[52:41] Ruth and they dwelt there about 10 years
[52:44] and Maan and chilion died also both of
[52:46] them and the woman was left of her two
[52:49] sons and her husband then she arose with
[52:52] her daughters-in-law that she might
[52:55] returned from the country of Moab for
[52:57] she had heard in the country of Moab how
[53:01] that the Lord had visited his people in
[53:03] giving them bread wherefore she went
[53:06] forth out of the place where she was and
[53:08] her two daughters-in-law with her and
[53:10] they went on the way to return unto the
[53:13] land of Judah I want to title this this
[53:16] morning come home to Bethlehem pray the
[53:19] Lord would add his Blessing to the word
[53:20] you may be
[53:24] seated
[53:25] when the going got rough in Israel IMC
[53:29] had a decision to
[53:31] make and you couldn't blame him for
[53:34] doing what he did because he did what
[53:36] was best for his family or so he thought
[53:39] in going down into uh Moab because the
[53:42] land there was more fertile and the land
[53:46] of uh if you if you know anything about
[53:48] the Middle East the land of Israel is
[53:49] different from many other nations
[53:52] countries around there because the land
[53:54] of Israel is dependent on water from
[53:57] rain and many of those countries and
[53:59] those arid regions are dependent on
[54:01] Rivers major rivers but the Jordan River
[54:04] really isn't that big of a river and so
[54:07] they're they're dependent on rain uh
[54:10] they were especially at that time
[54:12] dependent on rain so if there was a
[54:13] famine if there was a lack of rain there
[54:16] would be a lack of crops there would be
[54:17] a lack of bread and it would last
[54:20] sometimes for many years and and so we
[54:23] find that he made a a good decision for
[54:26] his family uh but yet or or or so it
[54:29] would seem at the time and yet we know
[54:32] it was the wrong decision because he
[54:34] died and his his two sons died and and
[54:38] it was just the grace of God and yet
[54:40] sometimes I think God allows us to make
[54:42] wrong decisions because ultimately he
[54:44] sees farther down the road than we do
[54:47] and you say Lord why didn't you prevent
[54:49] me from doing that and why didn't you
[54:51] keep me from uh from from being stupid
[54:54] in that way if if I could just put it in
[54:56] a way that we would put it and yet he
[54:57] can see Logan much farther than we can
[55:00] see him he knew that you would make that
[55:03] decision but he also knew what he had
[55:05] planned for you in the future and he
[55:07] knew what he had planned for the church
[55:08] in the future and he knew what he had
[55:10] planned for your family in the future
[55:12] you believe he's got everything in
[55:14] control today everything is in his
[55:16] control so we should never get too upset
[55:19] about the the decisions that people make
[55:21] and yet and yet we know that there's a
[55:24] right thing to do and a wrong thing to
[55:25] do and the right thing to do is to be in
[55:28] Bethlehem to be in the land that you
[55:31] were planted in now the Bible says that
[55:34] that IMC was he was of Bethlehem Judah
[55:38] and what that means is that he was born
[55:41] there his family was born there that
[55:44] this was a place that had been divided
[55:46] when Joshua divided the land between the
[55:48] 12 tribes of Israel Joshua divided a
[55:51] certain portion to Judah and and that
[55:55] portion then there was a portion that
[55:56] was given to Caleb's family and from
[55:59] that portion that was given to Caleb's
[56:01] family there was a portion that was
[56:02] settled by Rahab and her husband salmon
[56:05] and the Bible tells us that salmon was
[56:07] the founder of Bethlehem it calls him
[56:10] the father of Bethlehem and so the land
[56:13] was allocated to a certain tribe and a
[56:15] certain family within that tribe and we
[56:17] know that in the scripture title could
[56:19] never completely pass from that family
[56:24] Leviticus 2 523 let's look at it for a
[56:26] moment he said the land shall not be
[56:28] sold
[56:30] forever the that's why they're having
[56:32] trouble in Israel right now because they
[56:35] had a possession that was given to them
[56:37] and they come back to the land and the
[56:39] people that were there didn't like it
[56:41] but he said the land shall not be sold
[56:44] forever yeah and so he says for the land
[56:47] is mine for you are strangers and
[56:50] sojourners with me and in all the land
[56:54] of your possession you shall Grant a
[56:57] Redemption for the land so he's telling
[57:00] you you could you could lose the
[57:02] benefits of the land for a time but you
[57:05] can't lose the land itself oh that gives
[57:08] me great confidence today because you
[57:11] might lose the benefits of being a
[57:13] Christian if you do something that you
[57:15] shouldn't do you might lose the benefits
[57:17] of being a Believer because there are
[57:19] great benefits to doing what God said
[57:21] you might lose that benefit for a while
[57:24] but you can never lose the
[57:26] land come on oh my the land cannot be
[57:29] lost it cannot be sold not even by our
[57:32] own stupidity not even by our own our
[57:35] own malevolence not even by saying well
[57:37] I'm you might have determined in your
[57:39] heart I'm leaving I'm going out I'm
[57:41] never going to listen to the word again
[57:43] I'll never listen to a prophet again
[57:45] I'll never be a part of that message
[57:46] cult again you might have determined
[57:48] that but if you were born in the land
[57:50] you're of that land you'll come back to
[57:53] that land yes sir you got to come back
[57:55] to that land that gives me great hope
[57:57] for those sister Stephanie who have went
[57:59] out and have to come back they must come
[58:01] back cuz you were born in this land you
[58:03] got to come back to this land and I
[58:05] think of brother Daniel's on call today
[58:07] and different ones that have come and
[58:09] and others I believe there's many more
[58:11] that are coming back why they were born
[58:12] in this land I'm not talking about a
[58:14] natural birth but they were Gods before
[58:16] the foundation of the earth and they're
[58:18] are they're still gods they always will
[58:20] be
[58:21] gods and they've got to come home at
[58:23] some point in their life to the
[58:26] word they've got to come back to the
[58:29] word hallelujah do you love him this
[58:32] morning the land could not be forever
[58:36] lost it was redeemable
[58:39] always and let me speak that to you
[58:42] today and I don't care what you've done
[58:44] or what you might some of you young
[58:45] people beat yourself up because you make
[58:47] mistakes you're redeemable
[58:50] always redeemable always it it belongs
[58:54] to you that's you're the portion of the
[58:56] people of the earth that God has chosen
[58:58] from before the foundation of the earth
[58:59] you are redeemable
[59:02] always
[59:04] right now that doesn't mean that the
[59:07] enemy surrounding
[59:09] Bethlehem will not attempt to take it by
[59:12] force
[59:13] yeah it doesn't mean that there won't be
[59:16] a
[59:16] battle but it means if you'll stay in
[59:19] the land and defend the land and come
[59:22] home to the land it's yours that's it
[59:27] belongs to you and the benefits and
[59:29] blessings of staying there belong to you
[59:31] if you'll stay in it if you'll defend it
[59:33] if you'll come back to it when you leave
[59:35] well that land belongs to you and God
[59:38] will help you keep it amen good yes in
[59:43] Moab IMC is dependent on his own
[59:46] works and Moab is dependent I tell you
[59:50] what the the the dealings of God may
[59:52] seem to be harsh in my life but but
[59:54] there I would much rather submit myself
[59:57] to the dealings of God even though they
[59:59] may be harsh than submit than go out and
[1:00:02] try to do it on my own right we we find
[1:00:05] that in David when the lord gave him a
[1:00:06] choice he said there's three different
[1:00:08] things that can happen and and which one
[1:00:10] do you want and and the final one was a
[1:00:12] plague that God the angel of God would
[1:00:14] come in and bring a plague and and David
[1:00:16] chose that one because he chose to throw
[1:00:18] himself in the hands of a merciful god
[1:00:21] and after a short span of time many
[1:00:23] people died after a short span of time
[1:00:26] the plague was lifted because he knew if
[1:00:28] it was in God's hands everything would
[1:00:30] be okay church I wish we'd put things in
[1:00:32] God's hands if you put it in God's hands
[1:00:34] every you put your job in God's hands
[1:00:36] everything's going to be okay put your
[1:00:37] marriage in God's hands everything's
[1:00:39] going to be okay if you try to do it by
[1:00:42] yourself you're just going to mess it up
[1:00:45] stay in the
[1:00:46] land that's good and the land was was
[1:00:51] theirs but they had to defend it and the
[1:00:54] same thing is true of our land which is
[1:00:56] all the promises of God for our
[1:00:59] day all the promises of God Luther had
[1:01:02] justification Wesley had sanctification
[1:01:05] we have all of it amen the Pentecostals
[1:01:08] had the restoration of the gifts we have
[1:01:09] all of it it all belongs to us and so
[1:01:14] we've got to defend all of the message
[1:01:16] of the hour that's why I don't like to
[1:01:18] see people get off on a tangent and only
[1:01:20] preach one little thing or one little
[1:01:22] part of it let me preach all of it let
[1:01:24] me let me grab a hold of all of it let
[1:01:27] me live all of
[1:01:30] it
[1:01:32] now good Bethlehem means the house of
[1:01:35] God's bread and immc being born in
[1:01:39] Bethlehem would give him certain
[1:01:41] rights and
[1:01:43] responsibilities as a
[1:01:45] bethlehemite that's good it means Not
[1:01:47] only was it his right to stay in the
[1:01:49] land but his responsibility to stay in
[1:01:52] the
[1:01:53] land that's good and he he he didn't
[1:01:56] keep his
[1:01:57] responsibility but he still had his
[1:01:59] right and he even died and was able to
[1:02:03] come back but Naomi was able to come
[1:02:05] back his family still benefited because
[1:02:07] of who he was even though he personally
[1:02:11] died in Moab
[1:02:13] now Bethlehem again means House of God's
[1:02:15] bread we know that Christ was born in
[1:02:19] Bethlehem and he became God's house of
[1:02:21] eternal life bread he is the bread of
[1:02:25] life he is our
[1:02:28] Bethlehem Christ is our
[1:02:31] Bethlehem and Jesus said this when he
[1:02:33] was on the earth he said unto them I am
[1:02:35] the bread of life he that cometh to me
[1:02:37] shall never hunger and he that believeth
[1:02:40] on me shall never thirst he had to go
[1:02:43] through the process of death to become
[1:02:46] bread just like a plant has to die for
[1:02:48] you to eat it right or it
[1:02:52] should but even if you you just cut it
[1:02:54] off and don't cook it I like my plants
[1:02:56] cooked if I'm going to eat plants I want
[1:02:59] it to be coated in in something and
[1:03:02] cooked come
[1:03:03] on Amen I'm glad I got some help on that
[1:03:07] but if you're going to eat plants you
[1:03:08] want them to be yellow right you want
[1:03:10] them be all the all the all the vitamins
[1:03:12] cooked out of them so they taste
[1:03:14] good but but now Jesus had to go through
[1:03:18] that process he he was God's he was
[1:03:21] God's plant if we could say it that way
[1:03:23] but he he was God's tree but he had to
[1:03:26] die he had to be cut off he had to die
[1:03:29] so that he could be made bread he was
[1:03:31] God's wheat and he had to be he had to
[1:03:34] be cut down so he could become bread for
[1:03:37] you and I he had to die to become bread
[1:03:41] brother Brandon said you can only live
[1:03:42] by natural substance he said then if you
[1:03:44] can only live by natural by dead
[1:03:45] substance something had to die so you
[1:03:48] can live natural how much more did
[1:03:50] something have to die so you can live
[1:03:52] eternally Christ died that we might live
[1:03:55] eternally aren't you glad for that today
[1:03:58] Christ died so that we might live
[1:04:00] eternally and he become the house of
[1:04:03] God's eternal life bread that we catch I
[1:04:06] love this freshly every hour of the day
[1:04:10] coming down from God out of heaven like
[1:04:12] the Mana did in the Old Testament coming
[1:04:14] down from God out of heaven in the form
[1:04:16] of the Holy Spirit feeds our hungry
[1:04:18] Souls as we sit together in Heavenly
[1:04:21] places he is our Bethlehem all right
[1:04:24] then he said all true believing sons of
[1:04:28] God are born in Bethlehem with
[1:04:32] him oh my there's the difference there's
[1:04:36] the difference in the one that that
[1:04:39] makes it in the one that doesn't you got
[1:04:40] to be born in Bethlehem if you're born
[1:04:42] in Bethlehem you'll come back to
[1:04:45] Bethlehem he but they're born in God's
[1:04:47] Bethlehem he said if Christ had to
[1:04:49] become the bread of life to be born in
[1:04:51] Bethlehem which is life's bread house
[1:04:53] and everyone of True Believers in Christ
[1:04:55] is born in Christ they are born in God's
[1:04:57] Bethlehem he said not only Jesus was
[1:04:59] born in Bethlehem he said I was born in
[1:05:02] Bethlehem you were born in Bethlehem how
[1:05:05] did you do it he he he was speaking in
[1:05:07] the rata in he said right here in
[1:05:08] Phoenix Arizona this morning in the
[1:05:10] remata you can be born again in God's
[1:05:12] Bethlehem House of Eternal bread life I
[1:05:14] say to you this morning right here in
[1:05:16] Hardy Arkansas in Word of Life
[1:05:18] Tabernacle you can be born again you can
[1:05:21] be born in Bethlehem today you can be
[1:05:24] born in Bethlehem if you've not been
[1:05:26] born you can be born into a place that
[1:05:28] you can never leave and you can and it's
[1:05:30] always
[1:05:31] yours said well I've always nothing's
[1:05:34] ever belonged to me I've always lived a
[1:05:35] life of seemed like everything's against
[1:05:37] me and and and I've lived this dark kind
[1:05:40] of existence but come home to Bethlehem
[1:05:43] there's something inside of you you
[1:05:44] wouldn't be in the house of God today if
[1:05:46] there wasn't something inside of you
[1:05:47] pulling you to Bethlehem you said I I
[1:05:50] just you don't understand the anxiety of
[1:05:51] my life you don't understand the trouble
[1:05:53] that's in my life come home to Bethlehem
[1:05:56] and you'll find a place where there's
[1:05:57] bread a place where there's something
[1:05:59] that'll satisfy your soul put the joy of
[1:06:02] God in your
[1:06:03] life come home to
[1:06:06] Bethlehem Hallelujah he said eat it and

[1:06:16] live forever wherever you live in the
[1:06:19] world eat it and live

[1:06:25] the said why little Bethlehem that's
[1:06:26] today why a bunch of little Holy Rollers
[1:06:29] why this that or the other the people
[1:06:30] don't know what it's all about but the
[1:06:32] spirit reveals it the word shows it it's
[1:06:35] the manifestation of God's word we have
[1:06:37] life through Christ and him alone our
[1:06:41] organizations our denominations our
[1:06:43] differences only separates us from
[1:06:46] God we have one access to God and that's
[1:06:50] through Jesus Christ there's not another
[1:06:52] way that we can come through in by no
[1:06:54] Priest No preacher no system or nothing
[1:06:56] else only Jesus Christ and him crucified
[1:07:00] he's God's bread of life and we are
[1:07:02] borned in him and if he is God's bread
[1:07:04] of life then he is Bethlehem and being
[1:07:07] born in Christ we are then God born in
[1:07:09] Bethlehem in Christ Jesus sitting
[1:07:11] together in Heavenly places eating of
[1:07:14] him eating of him who is he he's the
[1:07:16] word in the beginning was the word and
[1:07:18] the Word was with God and the Word was
[1:07:19] God and when we can sit with one
[1:07:22] objective the word of God
[1:07:24] that's our objective in meeting together
[1:07:26] is the word of God that's why we put so
[1:07:28] much emphasis on the word it's our
[1:07:30] objective the word not the word for
[1:07:32] another day but the word for this day
[1:07:34] the word revealed by the prophet of
[1:07:36] Malachi 4 the word for our hour the
[1:07:39] opening of the word for our day the
[1:07:41] Seven Seals being open now we have a
[1:07:43] word that we can feed on the full seven
[1:07:45] course
[1:07:47] meal amen and he said we're eating of
[1:07:49] him in the beginning was the word the
[1:07:51] word was with God we can sit with one
[1:07:52] objective the word of God and feat upon
[1:07:54] that we are in God's spiritual Bethlehem
[1:07:56] eating God's spiritual bread and our
[1:07:58] souls punctuating every word that he
[1:08:01] spoke with an amen he said we enjoy this
[1:08:03] heavenly angel food when it says these
[1:08:07] signs shall follow them that believe the
[1:08:08] Creed or denomination says so it isn't
[1:08:10] so but the real man who's born in
[1:08:12] Bethlehem says amen The Works that I do
[1:08:15] shall you do also now some of those
[1:08:17] Works might surprise you maybe we'll
[1:08:19] talk about that tonight but the
[1:08:20] denomination says it's a bunch of workup
[1:08:22] emotion but the real Beth dweller says
[1:08:25] amen amen because he is satisfied that's
[1:08:28] angels's food if you abide in me and my
[1:08:31] words in you ask what you will it'll be
[1:08:32] done for you amen oh he said the high
[1:08:35] and prudent will never see it we hold so
[1:08:37] much to our traditions of the elders so
[1:08:39] much we have to pack carts and
[1:08:40] everything else to get in some Pulpit he
[1:08:42] said that ain't it you can get in God's
[1:08:44] Pulpit by humbling
[1:08:46] yourself that's still true today that's
[1:08:48] good advice for preachers you want to
[1:08:50] get in the Pulpit I'm not talking to
[1:08:52] ours here ours are are some of the the
[1:08:53] humblest preachers that I know is the
[1:08:55] ministers I have working with me here
[1:08:57] but I'll say this there's ministers
[1:08:58] across the country working to get in
[1:09:00] certain groups to try to get in the
[1:09:02] pulpits that's not how you get in the
[1:09:03] Pulpit you don't get in the Pulpit by a
[1:09:05] membership card you get In a Pulpit by
[1:09:07] humbling yourself com to the house of
[1:09:10] the bread of life Jesus Christ and live
[1:09:12] forever in his presence you want to be a
[1:09:14] a go a preacher that's worth something
[1:09:16] you want to be a preacher that can help
[1:09:17] somebody get into God's Bethlehem feed
[1:09:20] on the word of
[1:09:22] God
[1:09:25] come into the house of the bread of life
[1:09:26] Jesus Christ live forever in his
[1:09:28] presence and lifted up in Heavenly
[1:09:30] places in Christ Jesus feasting on the
[1:09:32] word that's God's
[1:09:34] Bethlehem come home to
[1:09:37] Bethlehem
[1:09:38] IMC left
[1:09:40] Bethlehem and I want you to understand
[1:09:43] today and maybe I'll get a little bit
[1:09:45] just doing what I do today and it's
[1:09:46] going to sound very much like me and but
[1:09:49] but it is me so it'll be all
[1:09:52] right
[1:09:54] you know there's certain things you
[1:09:55] stress on as a minister and there's
[1:09:57] certain things that you don't and and
[1:10:00] and I want to declare the whole word of
[1:10:01] God but these are things that that that
[1:10:04] I I just want to establish in your heart
[1:10:07] Bethlehem is not a
[1:10:10] church yeah right neither is it a
[1:10:13] pastor or a Ministry or even a
[1:10:18] prophet there's a spirit in the message
[1:10:20] today that if you're associated with
[1:10:21] certain Ministries or or churches I say
[1:10:24] there is there seems to be that that
[1:10:27] you're in the message if you're
[1:10:29] associated with a certain church and God
[1:10:31] forbid that that would ever be around
[1:10:34] us you're not in the message because
[1:10:36] you're associated with Word of Life
[1:10:38] Tabernacle right it's
[1:10:41] nonsense people say well if you leave
[1:10:44] then you're
[1:10:47] backsliding I it's
[1:10:51] nonsense I could say more about that but
[1:10:53] I want we're not a gang a cult or a
[1:10:56] denomination we're a
[1:10:59] body and we're not just a body among
[1:11:02] ourselves right we are a body here in
[1:11:04] the church but this is a local body but
[1:11:07] there's a the body itself is is wide
[1:11:09] it's it's far it stretches over the
[1:11:11] entire Earth and so when a person leaves
[1:11:15] I you know I want everyone and and we're
[1:11:17] not nobody's leaving nobody's thinking
[1:11:19] about leaving and nobody has left so
[1:11:22] just just just get that out of your mind
[1:11:24] I just want to lay this principle in I I
[1:11:27] want everyone to come here who wants to
[1:11:28] be here but a person who leaves this
[1:11:30] church should be treated just the same
[1:11:32] as when they were
[1:11:36] here there should be no difference in
[1:11:38] how we treat
[1:11:41] people and we want to establish that in
[1:11:43] our hearts today because we're here to
[1:11:45] help people and we can't help everybody
[1:11:48] so if you can get help somewhere else go
[1:11:50] get help somewhere else right maybe one
[1:11:53] day you can come back and return and and
[1:11:55] be with us maybe there'll be a day we
[1:11:57] can help you but if we can't help you go
[1:11:59] get go where you can get
[1:12:00] help and we should treat people the same
[1:12:03] whether they leave or whether they come
[1:12:05] and and brother brandom you know he he
[1:12:08] he treated people that way and I that's
[1:12:09] what I want to Aspire to yeah it hurts
[1:12:12] when people do things that are you feel
[1:12:14] like they will will hurt them but but
[1:12:16] listen we got to treat people the way
[1:12:18] Jesus would treat people and Jesus
[1:12:20] wasn't from Word of Life Tabernacle we
[1:12:23] want to believe he's here with us but
[1:12:25] he's also in every other church that
[1:12:27] preaches the gospel the message of the
[1:12:32] hour good preaching sometimes people
[1:12:35] leave for the wrong reasons and I'll say
[1:12:37] this they still they still are gods they
[1:12:40] were still born in
[1:12:42] Bethlehem and need to be treated as
[1:12:46] such brother brandom had some that did
[1:12:49] that they couldn't take correction on
[1:12:50] the gifts they wanted the gifts to be
[1:12:52] open in the church and brother brandham
[1:12:54] didn't want that and uh and brother
[1:12:56] brandham they they couldn't take
[1:12:58] correction on that and they
[1:13:00] left and you know someone leaving a
[1:13:02] prophet's
[1:13:04] Church you might look at that and say
[1:13:06] well you know you just forsook the
[1:13:09] messenger of the hour and brother Bram
[1:13:11] did have some things to say about them
[1:13:13] he he he calls them illegitimate
[1:13:16] children and he says this he said he
[1:13:18] tells about him he said I said just let
[1:13:20] it alone they're babies we can't judge
[1:13:22] it he said but watch when it really
[1:13:23] comes down to pin down to the word so
[1:13:25] it's not our job to correct
[1:13:27] everybody right but let's just in our
[1:13:29] church let's just do it the way a
[1:13:30] prophet said right that's all we can do
[1:13:33] but brother brandom he he said they're
[1:13:34] they're they're babies but watch when it
[1:13:36] really comes to pin down to the word
[1:13:38] sometimes I'll say this sometimes we
[1:13:40] need to get out of order but we do need
[1:13:41] to stay with the word brother BR said we
[1:13:43] need to get out of order long enough to
[1:13:45] get saved but we do need to stay with
[1:13:47] the word you understand so we we we
[1:13:49] can't judge other people on that now but
[1:13:52] these people left now brother Bron said
[1:13:54] now brother Junior Jackson had a right
[1:13:55] to disagree with that he wants his
[1:13:58] church and the people all want to speak
[1:14:00] with tongues and things in the audience
[1:14:01] that's brother Junior's troubles he says
[1:14:04] that's up to him but I love this he said
[1:14:07] but Junior Jackson believes this message
[1:14:09] the same as any of the rest of us does
[1:14:11] he's one of us brother Brandon is not
[1:14:13] telling a lie that's right right he's
[1:14:17] not saying that to make brother Junior
[1:14:18] feel good because brother junr wasn't
[1:14:19] there that
[1:14:21] night he's saying that because was
[1:14:23] wanted the people to treat the people
[1:14:25] that left a certain
[1:14:27] way and brother Junior uh brother junior
[1:14:30] he said believes the message the same as
[1:14:31] any the rest of us does and he said it's
[1:14:33] not a dead bird to go there Junior
[1:14:35] Jackson is a man of God that I love with
[1:14:36] all my heart and is not here tonight so
[1:14:39] I can really pour it on the way I want
[1:14:40] to he said and Don Ruddell I don't think
[1:14:42] Don's here tonight because they got
[1:14:43] church of their own can you imagine
[1:14:45] having church when brother Brandon was
[1:14:46] having
[1:14:48] church now just think about it for a
[1:14:50] minute if brother brandham was standing
[1:14:53] was in Cherokee Village having church I
[1:14:55] would
[1:14:59] dismiss and have church with brother
[1:15:01] brandom I'm serious about that we would
[1:15:05] want to hear what he had to
[1:15:06] say but Brother Don rutle
[1:15:09] didn't at times brother Junior Jackson
[1:15:12] didn't at times they had Church in fact
[1:15:14] brother Brandon went and preached for
[1:15:15] them and had church at the Tabernacle
[1:15:16] the same
[1:15:19] night so and we don't hardly understand
[1:15:23] understand that you said well they just
[1:15:24] didn't have a revelation well maybe but
[1:15:26] that's not what a prophet said about
[1:15:28] them brother Brown said he said Don's
[1:15:31] got church they have church of their own
[1:15:32] he said but I if I seen every person
[1:15:35] come to this Tabernacle walk out and go
[1:15:36] to Don rle or brother JT Parnell or any
[1:15:38] of these brothers here that's our
[1:15:39] brothers and fellow citizens of the
[1:15:41] Kingdom I'd be so happy I wouldn't know
[1:15:43] what to
[1:15:45] do I'd say Lord fill this one back up
[1:15:48] again let's pour it out and fill up
[1:15:51] another one the more souls we can see
[1:15:53] Born Into the kingdom of God the
[1:15:55] better let's fill them all up let's put
[1:15:57] our shoulder to the whe and do the very
[1:15:59] you say brother Ben you're you're you
[1:16:00] sound like paulana well I'd rather sound
[1:16:02] like that than than old grumpy face you
[1:16:05] know I I just amen I'd rather sound like
[1:16:07] paulana than Scrooge to use another
[1:16:10] literary
[1:16:12] character I don't want to be a scrooge I
[1:16:14] want to be I want to be somebody who can
[1:16:16] help people and if we can help people
[1:16:18] let's help people with everything that
[1:16:19] we got why don't we just do that with
[1:16:21] all of our
[1:16:22] heart you don't you don't because your
[1:16:24] family members move you don't uh you
[1:16:26] don't ostra I hope you don't hope you
[1:16:28] don't cut them off because they leave
[1:16:30] your
[1:16:31] area right you don't do that but you
[1:16:34] love them that much more and you make an
[1:16:35] effort to go see them we want to be like
[1:16:38] that don't
[1:16:39] we i' say Lord fill this one back up
[1:16:42] that's my prayer I'll say this and I
[1:16:44] we'll get back to our subject but are we
[1:16:45] edifying the body or are we building
[1:16:49] kingdoms here Paul says in Galatians 61
[1:16:52] brethren if a man be overtaken in a
[1:16:54] fault ye which are spiritual somebody's
[1:16:57] got to be
[1:16:59] spiritual ye which are spiritual restore
[1:17:01] such a one in the spirit of meekness
[1:17:05] considering thyself lest thou also be
[1:17:07] tempted yes they were wrong yes they did
[1:17:09] wrong but restore that one who did wrong
[1:17:12] you might do wrong one day and you might
[1:17:15] need a brother who's faithful a brother
[1:17:17] or a sister who loves you to step up on
[1:17:20] your behalf to pray for you to intercede
[1:17:22] for you you might need somebody to step
[1:17:25] into the Gap and pull you back into the
[1:17:27] house of
[1:17:31] God that considering thyself lest thou
[1:17:34] also be tempted so be careful what you
[1:17:36] associate with but love them with all of
[1:17:37] your
[1:17:39] heart the B said if the devil can keep
[1:17:42] us separated he's got us shooting at one
[1:17:43] another so he's got an open Target
[1:17:45] anywhere he wants to shoot what's the
[1:17:47] use of shooting we're shooting one
[1:17:49] another he could he can just sit back
[1:17:51] and
[1:17:52] relax if there ever what you know that
[1:17:54] war is such a strange thing if you look
[1:17:56] at at what's going on in Israel right
[1:17:58] now Israel and and Palestine we're
[1:18:00] funding both sides amen we're literally
[1:18:03] funding the Palestinians giving them
[1:18:05] money and Aid and then funding Israel
[1:18:08] that's never been done in the history of
[1:18:09] the world
[1:18:11] before and and you look at that and
[1:18:13] think how in the world can we expect
[1:18:14] anything but just more war more trouble
[1:18:18] more you know I say this maybe we ought
[1:18:20] to just let people work it out on their
[1:18:21] own but I'll say this when we support
[1:18:24] Israel we're supporting something that
[1:18:25] God
[1:18:27] established and yet and yet you look at
[1:18:30] the troubles around the world and and we
[1:18:32] just finan we we we gave Bin Laden
[1:18:34] weapons and then took us years to kill
[1:18:37] him right and so it's just it's not it's
[1:18:40] just terrible we don't want to be like
[1:18:41] that we don't want to think like that
[1:18:43] that's the way the kingdoms of this
[1:18:44] world think said one uh one demon that's
[1:18:47] over one country he'll get angry at
[1:18:49] another demon and they'll fight yeah you
[1:18:51] know demons fight each other that's
[1:18:53] right he said the the the demon that's
[1:18:55] over America will get will'll get angry
[1:18:58] and he'll fight over the demon that's
[1:18:59] over Russia because it's controlled by
[1:19:01] Satan yeah and each one has their own
[1:19:03] little little Spirit little little
[1:19:05] demonic power that that runs that place
[1:19:08] and and they begin to fight one one with
[1:19:10] another but that shouldn't be the people
[1:19:11] of God it shouldn't be the Churches of
[1:19:14] God we said what's the use of shooting
[1:19:16] we're shooting one another so we can
[1:19:17] just sit back and relax he said if I
[1:19:19] have found Grace in your sight through
[1:19:20] God you take my word for this brethren
[1:19:23] did did he find Grace in our sight he's
[1:19:25] a prophet of God he's the prophet for
[1:19:27] the
[1:19:29] age good now look you take my word for
[1:19:33] this he said if you want to be a
[1:19:35] blessing and get a blessing when a man
[1:19:38] has done you wrong absolutely justly he
[1:19:42] said I mean he has done you wrong and
[1:19:43] you know that he's done you wrong he's
[1:19:45] done you evil don't mention
[1:19:49] that you take him to prayer before God
[1:19:52] that's right God help me to live this
[1:19:54] word help me to come home to Bethlehem
[1:19:57] because Bethlehem is the word of God the
[1:19:59] bread of God let me come home to
[1:20:03] this is again Bethlehem is not a Church
[1:20:05] Bethlehem is the word Bethlehem is
[1:20:07] Christ let me come home to this to this
[1:20:10] truth yes he said don't mention that you
[1:20:13] take him to prayer before God and don't
[1:20:16] take it in a way of just as selfish and
[1:20:18] say well I'm supposed to do this but
[1:20:20] stand with your shoulder to his shoulder
[1:20:23] that means how could you do that if you
[1:20:24] disassociate from him the minute he does
[1:20:27] something wrong but you stand with his
[1:20:29] shoulder your shoulder to his shoulder
[1:20:31] stand in the presence of God our Father
[1:20:33] way of prayer should be made in the
[1:20:34] presence of God and say father here's my
[1:20:36] brother he justly he deserves punishment
[1:20:38] because he's done me evil and I don't
[1:20:40] see why he did it he said and then let
[1:20:42] God go talking to you and you'll see
[1:20:44] maybe what that man's been through yeah
[1:20:46] I've never seen a man who had no
[1:20:51] excuse
[1:20:53] now that doesn't mean they should do it
[1:20:55] I've never seen a man who didn't have
[1:20:56] some
[1:20:58] reason Hitler had some
[1:21:01] reason was the devil got into him but
[1:21:04] look at how he was raised and the things
[1:21:06] that happened in his life there's always
[1:21:08] something and that doesn't excuse one
[1:21:10] ounce of what they did but there's some
[1:21:14] reason and he said if you'll get to
[1:21:16] talking to God God will reveal to you
[1:21:19] maybe how that person was raised or
[1:21:21] something about their life and maybe
[1:21:22] you'll begin to see maybe things you
[1:21:24] know but you haven't considered about
[1:21:26] the way that person come up or or or the
[1:21:28] way that they are and you'll say you
[1:21:29] know what maybe he talks all the time
[1:21:31] because of this that happened in his
[1:21:33] life maybe she maybe she uh is this kind
[1:21:35] of maybe she's suspicious like that
[1:21:37] because of the way that things have been
[1:21:38] done to her maybe she sits in church and
[1:21:41] and acts different than everybody else
[1:21:42] or he sits in church and Acts a little
[1:21:44] different than everybody else and he say
[1:21:46] well that person is weird that person is
[1:21:47] odd but you don't know what that
[1:21:49] person's been through you don't know
[1:21:50] what the background of that person is he
[1:21:52] said if you could ever get down to
[1:21:54] business with God and begin to pray and
[1:21:56] you'll see maybe what that man's been
[1:21:58] through the devil has Twisted him up
[1:22:00] somewhere and caused him to do that
[1:22:02] though he's absolutely wrong he said
[1:22:03] before you leave the Throne of God
[1:22:05] you'll be feeling sorry for that man
[1:22:07] that's right you'll be sympathizing with
[1:22:09] that brother he said and when you get
[1:22:11] back down to Earth again you'll go over
[1:22:13] to that brother and shake his hand cuz
[1:22:15] you know what he's been through oh God
[1:22:18] it takes the spirit of God to empathize
[1:22:20] the way we should with our brothers and
[1:22:22] sisters
[1:22:23] it takes the Holy Spirit to do that
[1:22:25] brother Brown said you can't pray for
[1:22:26] somebody for healing unless you can
[1:22:28] sympathize with their
[1:22:29] sickness that's why God called men men
[1:22:32] who are living because we a man that
[1:22:35] gets up and preaches ought to be able to
[1:22:36] empathize with the audience he's
[1:22:38] preaching to that goes through the same
[1:22:40] things God didn't just call Rich
[1:22:42] preachers he didn't just call preachers
[1:22:45] who've always done everything right he
[1:22:47] didn't just call preachers who who who
[1:22:49] were perfect he didn't just call
[1:22:51] preachers who come from a certain part
[1:22:52] of the country but he called men from
[1:22:54] all over the world he called men with
[1:22:56] all kinds of different backgrounds why
[1:22:57] did he do that so they can speak life in
[1:22:59] a way that you can hear
[1:23:01] it and what I've been through helps me
[1:23:04] and I've finally come to that
[1:23:05] realization what I've been through in my
[1:23:07] life helps me Speak Life in a way you
[1:23:09] can hear it in Hardy Arkansas listen to
[1:23:11] me there's got to be we've got to
[1:23:13] remember God's doing that in our
[1:23:15] life right good he said you know what
[1:23:19] he's been through you can't stand with a
[1:23:21] mortal in the presence of God and
[1:23:22] condemn
[1:23:24] anybody I don't believe no sir even if
[1:23:26] he is a rank
[1:23:28] cner and what about a brother that's
[1:23:30] made a mistake though I say he's wrong
[1:23:33] sometimes he's accused wrong when he's
[1:23:35] not wrong but if he is wrong well if we
[1:23:38] will take him to the throne of God stand
[1:23:41] there shoulder toosh shoulder with our
[1:23:42] brother knowing he's a mortal and maybe
[1:23:45] his destination rest upon our attitude
[1:23:49] towards oh my yeah yes that's
[1:23:55] good I want to get I want I just want us
[1:23:57] to get this real close sometimes we need
[1:23:59] to hear fast anointed preaching that
[1:24:02] gets us up out of our seats and
[1:24:03] sometimes we just need to soak in it a
[1:24:04] little
[1:24:09] bit what if how would I treat you if my
[1:24:14] attitude towards you might determine
[1:24:17] your Eternal
[1:24:18] destination young people you need to
[1:24:20] think about that
[1:24:24] how you treat one another talking to one
[1:24:25] another sir I know how message youth
[1:24:28] groups can
[1:24:31] get kids you need to think about that
[1:24:35] Elders we need to think about
[1:24:37] that what if the Eternal destination of
[1:24:40] the waitress at the restaurant that we
[1:24:41] frequent depends on our
[1:24:43] attitude towards
[1:24:46] them that's good preaching what is the
[1:24:49] Eternal destination of the person
[1:24:50] sitting next to you in the Pew or the
[1:24:52] person maybe that you don't talk to very
[1:24:53] much or you've never washed their feet
[1:24:55] or you really don't like them to even to
[1:24:57] see them take communion because you say
[1:24:59] well they've done this this and that
[1:25:00] what if their Eternal destination rest
[1:25:03] on your attitude towards
[1:25:06] them if you really believe what a
[1:25:08] prophet
[1:25:10] said if I really believe what a prophet
[1:25:12] said how would we treat people yeah good
[1:25:17] when we come back from the Throne of God
[1:25:19] he said we'll realize that we're
[1:25:21] everyone guilty see we're everyone
[1:25:23] guilty and we all need help one from the
[1:25:25] other and the best way to do is
[1:25:30] pray and and we must stand for
[1:25:33] truth I've got to as a pastor I'm in a
[1:25:35] position I've got to preach the word and
[1:25:37] I've got to tell you what what the word
[1:25:38] says I can't change it I wish I
[1:25:41] sometimes I wish I could for you but I
[1:25:43] can't do that I can't make an exception
[1:25:45] for my family for anybody
[1:25:47] else the word is the truth it's the
[1:25:50] truth no matter whether I say or
[1:25:51] somebody else I'm not not going to I
[1:25:52] can't cross that that's the whole reason
[1:25:55] why I'm here God help me if I ever cross
[1:25:58] that for favoritism but we treat people
[1:26:01] we don't treat people like objects yeah
[1:26:04] we don't treat people like numbers
[1:26:06] they're not pawns and our macav in games
[1:26:09] they're the purchase of God's
[1:26:12] blood that's
[1:26:15] good brother brand said I don't want to
[1:26:17] hurt feelings but I'm responsible for a
[1:26:19] message and the message is come out of
[1:26:21] this mess if asked you to come out where
[1:26:23] am I going to take you to I read this to
[1:26:24] you recently but it just fits right here
[1:26:26] he said I'd take you to the brandham
[1:26:27] Tabernacle it's as much fault as any of
[1:26:29] the rest of them but there's one place I
[1:26:31] can take you to where you're safe and
[1:26:33] protected from Death that's in Jesus
[1:26:35] Christ God's place of worship he said
[1:26:37] that's the place I'm introducing to you
[1:26:39] tonight where God put his name where he
[1:26:41] promised he would meet every person to
[1:26:43] come in there he would worship with him
[1:26:45] and feast with him that's in Christ not
[1:26:47] in no
[1:26:48] church we put way too much value on who
[1:26:51] is preaching in the PO open what church
[1:26:53] we go to we should love our church we
[1:26:55] should go to church but we'll do that
[1:26:56] because we love
[1:26:59] God he's not no church no Tabernacle but
[1:27:02] in Christ he is God's Tabernacle he is
[1:27:05] the place that God came into himself and
[1:27:07] dwelt in him this is my beloved Son in
[1:27:10] whom I'm pleased to dwell
[1:27:12] in he is God's Tabernacle it should be
[1:27:16] easy to see the opening of the seventh
[1:27:19] sealen just let that soak in 1
[1:27:22] Corinthians 3:5 who then is Paul and who
[1:27:25] is apollis but ministers but whom you
[1:27:27] believed even as the lord gave to every
[1:27:29] man I have planted a poish watered but
[1:27:32] God gave the increase so then neither is
[1:27:34] he that planteth anything neither he
[1:27:36] that WTH but God that giveth the
[1:27:38] increase and I want to say to you with
[1:27:40] all of my heart with all of my voice
[1:27:42] with everything I can I can muster out
[1:27:44] of my overweight body I want to be able
[1:27:46] to save you with all of my all of the
[1:27:48] life that I've got in me hear ye
[1:27:50] him hear you him I want to point like a
[1:27:53] prophet did in our day and pointed back
[1:27:55] to the cross and he said hear you him
[1:27:57] not your Methodist not your not your
[1:28:00] denomination not your Baptist not your
[1:28:02] little group around the message but here
[1:28:04] Christ not this church not this pastor
[1:28:07] but
[1:28:08] Christ that's
[1:28:13] good come
[1:28:15] home to
[1:28:17] Christ he is our bethle you say well I I
[1:28:22] haven't left maybe we didn't leave the
[1:28:26] Pew but maybe we wandered in our heart
[1:28:29] from the word that's good come
[1:28:35] home was a famine in Israel but the B
[1:28:37] said during the time of the judges when
[1:28:38] the first thing coming time when Israel
[1:28:40] got away from God when they did the
[1:28:41] water supply was withheld when people
[1:28:44] get away from God today the water supply
[1:28:45] is withheld all of blessings will be
[1:28:48] withheld yeah that doesn't mean that if
[1:28:51] you're in financial iial trouble that
[1:28:53] your the water is being withheld let me
[1:28:55] just deal with that well how does the
[1:28:57] water get up withheld today it's the
[1:28:59] presence of God it's the spiritual
[1:29:02] blessings of God in your life you can't
[1:29:04] get Revelation you can't seem to just
[1:29:07] cold and dry and dead yeah and it may
[1:29:10] God May deal with you in a financial way
[1:29:12] but the primary way he deals with us in
[1:29:14] this in this day is through spiritual
[1:29:17] blessings yeah amen the blessings are
[1:29:19] withheld when we get away from God and
[1:29:20] again don't let don't let a scare come
[1:29:23] into you say well if I get away from
[1:29:25] this church or this ministry or or if I
[1:29:27] mess up and and and in my life in some
[1:29:29] way and all that God's going to leave me
[1:29:31] you know he said I'll never leave you
[1:29:34] I'll never forsake you that's right Amen
[1:29:36] to get away from God is to get away from
[1:29:38] his presence to get away from the word
[1:29:40] which brings his
[1:29:42] presence and when you do that all other
[1:29:44] blessings will be
[1:29:46] withheld Naomi means
[1:29:50] Pleasant IMC was was her husband his
[1:29:53] name means worship Pleasant worship was
[1:29:57] her family they had a son meon that mean
[1:30:00] sickness and chilon meant weary gloomy
[1:30:03] sadness and that was the family and
[1:30:06] there come a famine in the land of
[1:30:08] Israel he said the first mistake a Jew
[1:30:11] ever makes is leave that land God gave
[1:30:12] them that land when Abraham was given
[1:30:14] that land God told him not to leave the
[1:30:16] land and he made a mistake when he went
[1:30:17] down into GR got in trouble the Jew is
[1:30:19] never to lead Palestine that's his
[1:30:21] lotted place
[1:30:22] and they had been drove out all over the
[1:30:24] world he said now they're returning back
[1:30:25] again don't you that's where the battle
[1:30:27] is it's back home come home to the
[1:30:31] Bethlehem when you come home there's
[1:30:33] going to be a battle when you get home
[1:30:35] but there's a battle worth fighting yes
[1:30:38] when you get home all right there's a
[1:30:40] there's a victory worth winning a
[1:30:42] victory you can win when you come home
[1:30:44] to Bethlehem yeah said they've been
[1:30:47] drove out all over the world now they're
[1:30:48] returning back again oh it's such a
[1:30:49] beautiful story we have here this
[1:30:51] morning they are
[1:30:53] returning
[1:30:54] back they're returning back back it
[1:30:58] explains a lot about the current
[1:30:59] situation in Israel now Moab we know is
[1:31:02] a type of
[1:31:03] organization they left the freedom of
[1:31:06] the word for an organization that
[1:31:07] promised food but it wasn't God's bread
[1:31:11] it was moabite Creeds there was a price
[1:31:14] to pay for that elmc died their two sons
[1:31:17] died I'll say this when you trust in a
[1:31:20] church instead of Christ elim
[1:31:22] worship dies yeah did you hear that this
[1:31:26] morning worship dies when you trust in
[1:31:30] something else instead of Christ that's
[1:31:32] right I know many people want Worship in
[1:31:34] their life now it can be a deceiving
[1:31:36] thing in the sense that there's some
[1:31:38] people there are people who can still
[1:31:39] worship and yet be living in sin and
[1:31:42] I'll say this that if you can do that
[1:31:44] today that's a scary place it's a scary
[1:31:48] place to be able to worship and live in
[1:31:50] an out andout sin
[1:31:52] because when you do that what you're
[1:31:53] doing is you've disassociated worship
[1:31:55] from the presence of God that's right
[1:31:58] because God is not with you when you're
[1:31:59] against the word and and he didn't
[1:32:02] brother B say he doesn't leave he goes
[1:32:03] to the Gable end of your soul right if
[1:32:05] you're a person that's filled with the
[1:32:06] Holy Ghost you can do things that are
[1:32:08] against the word but what what will he
[1:32:09] do he'll go to he'll he his his presence
[1:32:12] his in his imminent presence is not felt
[1:32:15] and that's how we know I need to check
[1:32:18] up that's right and we don't look you
[1:32:20] know we don't look to work our our elves
[1:32:22] up when we can't
[1:32:24] worship the answer is not to work
[1:32:26] ourselves into worship the answer is to
[1:32:28] see in our lives where is there a
[1:32:31] place examine ourselves where have I
[1:32:33] strayed from the word I can't the the
[1:32:36] presence of God seems like just not
[1:32:37] there anymore I can't touch him like I
[1:32:39] used to where if we' strayed from the
[1:32:41] word and
[1:32:43] usually sometimes God's withhold God
[1:32:45] withholds His blessings but usually
[1:32:47] we'll find some
[1:32:49] way that we've just given in yeah and
[1:32:53] that's where a Christian when they find
[1:32:55] that says Lord forgive me and then it's
[1:32:57] under the blood it's all over yes right
[1:33:01] now look when you trust in a church when
[1:33:04] you go to Moab instead of trusting in
[1:33:07] Christ when you trust in your own
[1:33:08] efforts instead of trusting God worship
[1:33:11] dies yeah that's right brother Brandon
[1:33:14] said that cycle of Revival and death has
[1:33:15] never failed all you have to do is
[1:33:16] recall the last move of the spirit when
[1:33:19] men and women dressed like Christians
[1:33:20] went to church prayed all night took the
[1:33:21] street corners and weren't ashamed of
[1:33:23] the manifestations of the spirit they
[1:33:25] left their all dead churches and
[1:33:26] worshiped in homes or old store
[1:33:27] buildings they had reality but it wasn't
[1:33:30] too long a time until they began to get
[1:33:31] enough money to build fine new churches
[1:33:33] they put in a choir instead of singing
[1:33:34] unto God for themselves they put gowns
[1:33:36] on the choir they organized the movement
[1:33:38] and ran it by man they soon began to
[1:33:40] read books that weren't fit to read they
[1:33:41] let down the bars and goats came in and
[1:33:43] took over the Cry Of Joy was gone the
[1:33:46] freedom of the spirit was gone what was
[1:33:48] it worship died immc died in Moab
[1:33:53] yes God help us
[1:33:55] today the Cry Of Joy was gone the
[1:33:58] Blackness of Ashes is all about about
[1:34:00] all that is
[1:34:01] left we leave the word we lose our true
[1:34:03] worship we might shout dance speak in
[1:34:06] tongues but the connection is gone
[1:34:08] that's right oh God help me to stay in
[1:34:10] Bethlehem help me to come home to
[1:34:14] Bethlehem I'll say this if you want to
[1:34:16] keep worship alive stay in Bethlehem we
[1:34:20] know that every word of the Bible is
[1:34:21] breathed out by God I'll say this which
[1:34:23] one is more important than the
[1:34:26] other 2 Timothy 3:16 all scriptures
[1:34:29] given by inspiration of God it's
[1:34:31] literally expiration brother Bram said
[1:34:33] it's breathing
[1:34:34] out all scripture how much of it is it
[1:34:38] all of
[1:34:41] it it's profitable for Doctrine for
[1:34:43] reprove for correction for instruction
[1:34:45] and righteousness remember Eve
[1:34:47] misinterpreted one word and lost her
[1:34:49] worship when God come down in the the
[1:34:51] cool of the evening we talked about when
[1:34:54] in the time when she might get anxious
[1:34:56] and the Holy Spirit come down over that
[1:34:58] little couple and and met with them in
[1:35:01] the cool of the
[1:35:02] evening and Eve because she
[1:35:04] misinterpreted one
[1:35:06] word because the serpent that became her
[1:35:08] interpreter she lost her ability to
[1:35:11] worship there in the Garden of Eden come
[1:35:13] on Matthew 4:4 says that man shall not
[1:35:16] live by bread alone but by every word
[1:35:18] that proceedeth out of the mouth of God
[1:35:21] and I say this most people I think
[1:35:23] especially most Christians they want to
[1:35:25] be able to worship they want to be able
[1:35:27] to to be free in the spirit they want to
[1:35:28] be able I think all of us can say that
[1:35:30] this morning I want to be able to be
[1:35:32] free I I want to be able I know there's
[1:35:34] some types of people that just sit there
[1:35:36] and cry you that that's the that's the
[1:35:38] most the loudest you'll ever be is
[1:35:39] completely silent and I'll say this
[1:35:41] that's there's some people are like that
[1:35:43] that's okay that's right that's all
[1:35:45] right we don't all have to be hollers
[1:35:47] and shouters and and stuff but but I'll
[1:35:49] say this that that there's got to be
[1:35:51] worshiped whatever that whatever that is
[1:35:53] to you whatever that whatever presses
[1:35:55] out of your heart you got to be able to
[1:35:56] know that God is near the church can't
[1:35:59] be just a formal experience it can't be
[1:36:01] just someplace you go and you sit here
[1:36:03] and act and are miserable for 30 minutes
[1:36:05] or an hour while the preacher preaches
[1:36:07] at you that can't be what church is
[1:36:09] about church has got to be an experience
[1:36:12] with God every servant you say well I
[1:36:14] had an experience one day every service
[1:36:16] ought to be a new refilling of the Holy
[1:36:18] Ghost it ought to be a new experience
[1:36:20] with God
[1:36:21] it's an experience with the word and the
[1:36:23] word is God
[1:36:26] yes yes but I find many people want
[1:36:30] relief from famine they want to be able
[1:36:32] to worship but they don't want to stay
[1:36:33] in the
[1:36:34] land or come home to
[1:36:36] it again the land is not this church the
[1:36:40] land is the word amen the church Christ
[1:36:43] today oh heavenly father will you please
[1:36:45] send Jesus to us will you please and
[1:36:47] when the Holy Spirit begins to move in
[1:36:49] oh oh we don't want that well you be oh
[1:36:52] we we won't have this man rule over us
[1:36:53] oh I don't want to hear that there were
[1:36:56] people who cried for Revival in this
[1:36:57] area cried for cried for a move of the
[1:37:00] spirit and then God moves and they're
[1:37:02] like oh that's
[1:37:04] Pentecost I cried for years for Revival
[1:37:07] among the young people cry for years for
[1:37:09] Revival and then when it happens they're
[1:37:11] like well that's nothing to that yeah
[1:37:15] right oh my my no my he said I couldn't
[1:37:18] accept that my denomination won't
[1:37:19] believe that he said then you don't want
[1:37:21] a messiah you don't want the anointing
[1:37:24] if God sent a messiah he'd be exactly
[1:37:26] word by word of the Bible exactly what
[1:37:29] he was at the first time yes so brother
[1:37:31] brandom introduces this idea with you to
[1:37:33] you and I've got eight minutes left so
[1:37:35] I'm going to try to
[1:37:36] hurry brother brandham introduces this
[1:37:39] idea of coping with the word how many of
[1:37:40] you ever heard brother brandham say that
[1:37:42] you got to cope with the word if you've
[1:37:45] listened to the message very much and
[1:37:47] you remember you can search it you go
[1:37:49] back and look at that cope or coping it
[1:37:51] was say you have to cope with the word
[1:37:52] you got to be able to cope with the word
[1:37:53] of your day to cope and to cope means to
[1:37:57] deal with effectively even through
[1:38:00] difficulty it means to contend or to
[1:38:02] wrestle
[1:38:03] with did you know that coping just
[1:38:06] doesn't mean to agree with but it means
[1:38:08] to contend with Amen to wrestle with yes
[1:38:13] and every one of us wrestle with the
[1:38:15] word in our
[1:38:17] lives now now listen to this he said
[1:38:19] when this takes place he said the thing
[1:38:20] you'll do then he's talking about a
[1:38:21] believer that gets that new birth you'll
[1:38:23] find out the spirit comes in you from
[1:38:25] the New Birth you'll believe and do
[1:38:27] everything that God says and his word is
[1:38:28] for you to do and everything the Bible
[1:38:30] quotes for you to do you'll punctuate it
[1:38:32] with an
[1:38:33] amen right and he said you'll not stop
[1:38:36] day and night until you receive it
[1:38:37] that's right he said and in all this
[1:38:39] time you'll certainly above everything
[1:38:41] bear the fruit of the spirit above
[1:38:43] everything you'll bear the fruit of the
[1:38:44] spirit you say well I speak with tongues
[1:38:46] you might do that and you might not will
[1:38:47] I shout you might do that you might not
[1:38:49] but there's one sure thing you will do
[1:38:51] you will bear the Fruit of the Spirit
[1:38:53] and the fruit of the spirit is love joy
[1:38:55] peace Faith longsuffering meekness
[1:38:57] gentleness patience he said your temper
[1:39:00] will not be in on tape I listen to it to
[1:39:01] make sure he
[1:39:05] goes that sounded awful your temper will
[1:39:08] not be like that he said Just remember
[1:39:12] when you got that oh my that poisons the
[1:39:15] holy spirit away from you when you get
[1:39:17] to a place you want to fuss with
[1:39:19] everybody you come along to there's
[1:39:20] something wrong when you get to a place
[1:39:22] where a minister will read from the
[1:39:24] Bible that it's wrong to do a certain
[1:39:26] thing just remember he said there's no
[1:39:29] Christianity there at all now he said by
[1:39:32] their fruits you shall know them that's
[1:39:33] what Jesus said he said if it's the word
[1:39:35] and God said so that spirit in you will
[1:39:38] cope yes it doesn't mean you'll like it
[1:39:42] that's right
[1:39:43] right I hope you're hearing me I know
[1:39:46] sometimes people get quiet cuz they're
[1:39:47] coping with it they're wrestling with it
[1:39:50] it doesn't mean you like to hear it but
[1:39:52] you got to cope with
[1:39:53] it why because it's not my word and
[1:39:56] that's why I try not to preach what my
[1:39:58] ideas I may some things that I preach
[1:40:00] being a human might be my opinion but
[1:40:02] you can take it back to the word and if
[1:40:03] you see that it's the word cope with it
[1:40:07] you got to wrestle with
[1:40:10] it said cope with the word because the
[1:40:13] word is life and spirit the genuine Holy
[1:40:15] Spirit Will cope with the word Jesus
[1:40:17] said my words are life and if you got
[1:40:19] eternal life and he is the word how can
[1:40:20] the word deny the word see what kind of
[1:40:22] a person would you make God that's one
[1:40:24] thing to know that you're a Christian
[1:40:25] when you can fully agree upon every word
[1:40:27] of God that's how brother Brand's
[1:40:29] definition different from many of ours
[1:40:31] we say Well they're a Christian they're
[1:40:32] a Christian because they they went to
[1:40:34] church they're a Christian because they
[1:40:35] listened to a tape they're a Christian
[1:40:37] because they believe in a prophet
[1:40:38] they're a Christian because they go to
[1:40:39] word to Life Tabernacle that's not what
[1:40:41] a prophet said he said you're a
[1:40:42] Christian because you fully agree upon
[1:40:44] every
[1:40:45] word you won't totally agree with me
[1:40:48] maybe but you fully agree with the Bible
[1:40:52] and the message of the hour is the light
[1:40:54] God shown on the Bible you can't
[1:40:56] disagree with a word Prophet come
[1:40:59] on and cope with the
[1:41:03] word you say well things in the message
[1:41:05] you don't understand absolutely but I
[1:41:08] just put up on the Shelf leave it
[1:41:10] there someday I'll understand it that's
[1:41:12] right I got to cope with
[1:41:15] it got to wrestle with it yeah the idea
[1:41:18] that this that God sent a prophet that
[1:41:20] was a real prophet but a true Prophet I
[1:41:22] got to wrestle with it yeah can't just
[1:41:24] cast it off well that's an opinion and
[1:41:27] and again if it go if it goes all the
[1:41:28] way through the word all the way through
[1:41:30] the message all the way through the
[1:41:31] Bible I got to cope with it
[1:41:34] right that's good amen he said you find
[1:41:38] yourself in love with your
[1:41:41] enemies there's a tough
[1:41:44] one in
[1:41:46] love usually don't fall in love with
[1:41:48] your enemies but that's why love is a
[1:41:53] choice uh someone told me one time a
[1:41:55] youth pastor and it it made sense he
[1:41:56] said you fall out of your truck into a
[1:41:58] mud puddle you don't fall in
[1:42:03] love you you you choose to love yes you
[1:42:07] may fall into like
[1:42:10] attraction but you don't fall in
[1:42:13] love oh my say well he's nothing but a
[1:42:16] Holy Roller you start to get oh he said
[1:42:18] be careful be careful
[1:42:21] when you really find
[1:42:22] yourself that you love him who your
[1:42:26] enemy that's right regardless of what
[1:42:29] they do you still love them you can go
[1:42:32] read on and it's your life where the
[1:42:33] gospel he said if your family fusses
[1:42:34] don't fuss with them that's right yeah
[1:42:37] amen right and all of those things don't
[1:42:40] argue with
[1:42:41] them I want to I want to challenge you
[1:42:43] this morning does your life cope with
[1:42:46] that and I know right now that some of
[1:42:48] us are pitchforking at some of those
[1:42:49] people who fuss a lot lot and
[1:42:52] pitchforking on that and that's good
[1:42:54] they need to cope with that but what do
[1:42:56] you need to cope with what do you need
[1:42:58] to wrestle with today I know there's a
[1:43:00] different style of ministry maybe than
[1:43:02] what you get all the time but but listen
[1:43:04] to me you got to cope with the word amen
[1:43:07] can you be like Jacob who wrestled with
[1:43:10] the word when it come by his way when he
[1:43:12] found he was there in a desperate
[1:43:14] situation and and Esau was coming for
[1:43:17] his life and he the word come by his way
[1:43:19] the word and at the off any body come by
[1:43:22] Jacob's way and when it come by his way
[1:43:24] Jacob grabbed a hold of it yeah and he
[1:43:27] said I will not let you go come on until
[1:43:30] you bless me yes and his Blessing come
[1:43:33] in the form of a new name and a limp yes
[1:43:37] to show that he's been with God I said
[1:43:39] God let me be blessed today the blessing
[1:43:42] may not come in the form I look at it as
[1:43:44] but he's going to give me a new identity
[1:43:46] of the word and he's going to give me a
[1:43:48] limp to show me I can't do it by myself
[1:43:53] can you wrestle like Jacob with the word
[1:43:55] until it changes you Jose 12:4 he said
[1:43:57] he had power over the angel and
[1:44:00] prevailed he wept and made supplication
[1:44:02] that's how you wrestle you wrestle with
[1:44:05] tears you wrestle in your

[1:44:48] sins have been
[1:44:49] forgiven
[1:44:55] can you wrestle for Isaiah
[1:44:57] 535 there's a scripture to wrestle with
[1:45:00] he was wounded for our transgression you

[1:45:03] now he was wounded for our transgression
[1:45:06] he was bruised for our iniquity that
