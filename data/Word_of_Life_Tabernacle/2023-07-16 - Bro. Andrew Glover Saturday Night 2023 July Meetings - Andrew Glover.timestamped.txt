[1:20:25] lifted up so high dear God that the
[1:20:27] people cannot even see me the only thing
[1:20:29] they could see was this word and we'll
[1:20:31] be sure to give you all the praise all
[1:20:33] the honor and all the glory for it to do
[1:20:36] thy Wonderful Name the name of our Lord
[1:20:38] and Savior Jesus Christ we pray and all
[1:20:40] the Believers says
[1:20:42] amen and amen first Thessalonians 4 and
[1:20:45] verse 13. Paul said I would not have you
[1:20:48] to be ignorant Brethren concerning them
[1:20:50] which are asleep that you sorrow not
[1:20:52] even as others which have no hope
[1:20:55] for if we believe that Jesus died and
[1:20:58] rose again even so them also which sleep
[1:21:02] in Jesus will God bring with him for
[1:21:04] this we say unto you notice how they say
[1:21:06] this by the word of the Lord that we
[1:21:09] which are alive and remain unto the
[1:21:11] coming of the Lord shall not prevent
[1:21:14] them which are asleep so Paul is
[1:21:16] speaking by the word of the Lord
[1:21:17] concerning the coming of the Lord and
[1:21:20] then he breaks into it and says for the
[1:21:21] Lord himself shall descend from heaven
[1:21:23] with a shout with a voice of the
[1:21:25] Archangel and with the Trump of God and
[1:21:28] the dead in Christ shall rise first then
[1:21:32] we which are alive and remain shall be
[1:21:35] called up together with them in the
[1:21:37] clouds to meet the Lord in the air and
[1:21:40] so shall we ever be with the Lord and
[1:21:43] Paul says wherefore Comfort one another
[1:21:45] with these words now in the book of
[1:21:48] Colossians the first chapter
[1:21:50] we have just read of the resurrection
[1:21:53] and the Rapture of of coming from our
[1:21:55] Lord Jesus Christ and in Colossians 1
[1:21:58] and 15 Paul here is writing about the
[1:22:01] Divine preeminence of Christ and he says
[1:22:04] in the 15th verse who is the image of
[1:22:07] the invisible God the firstborn of every
[1:22:09] creature for by him were all things
[1:22:11] created that are in heaven that are in
[1:22:13] the earth that are visible invisible
[1:22:15] whether they be Thrones dominions
[1:22:17] principalities Powers all things were
[1:22:20] created by Him and for him and he is
[1:22:23] before all things and by him all things

[1:23:25] made a minister who now rejoice in my
[1:23:28] sufferings for you and fill up that
[1:23:29] which is behind of the afflictions of
[1:23:31] Christ in my flesh for his body's sake
[1:23:34] which is the church wherefore I made a
[1:23:36] minister according to the dispensation
[1:23:38] of God which is given to me for you to
[1:23:41] fulfill the word of God even the mystery
[1:23:44] somebody say mystery which has been hid
[1:23:46] from ages and from Generations but now
[1:23:48] somebody say but now
[1:23:50] but now is made manifest to his Saints
[1:23:53] to whom God would make known what is the
[1:23:55] riches of his glory of this mystery
[1:23:57] among the Gentiles here it is which is
[1:24:00] Christ in you the hope of glory whom we
[1:24:03] preach so we're not preaching ourselves
[1:24:05] we're not preaching our church we're not
[1:24:07] preaching our personality we're
[1:24:08] preaching Christ warning every man and
[1:24:11] teaching every man and all wisdom that
[1:24:14] we may present every man perfect in
[1:24:16] Christ Jesus Paul says we're unto also
[1:24:18] labor striving according to his working
[1:24:21] which worketh in me mightily amen we ask
[1:24:24] the Lord this evening to add the
[1:24:25] blessing to the reading of his word as
[1:24:27] you can be seated here this afternoon
[1:24:28] how many would say praise the Lord for
[1:24:30] the reading of the word of God
[1:24:32] hey man I I love the word of God don't
[1:24:35] you amen from those scriptures tonight I
[1:24:38] want you by the help of the Lord to just
[1:24:39] speak to you here and if I would title
[1:24:41] this tonight I want to speak to you on
[1:24:43] the Rapture Revelation taking
[1:24:45] preeminence in the body the Rapture
[1:24:48] Revelation taken preeminence in the body
[1:24:51] now brother Branham says in the token 63
[1:24:54] he says I'm looking for a time of a
[1:24:56] Break Forth how many is looking for that
[1:24:58] he said of the spirit of God in these
[1:25:00] last days that we're now living in him
[1:25:02] he says for another surge of the Holy
[1:25:04] Spirit into the church for a rapturing
[1:25:07] faith amen just before it comes
[1:25:09] everything is sitting straight in order
[1:25:11] for that he said and I believe that
[1:25:13] we're now at the time that the word
[1:25:16] should have preeminence how many will
[1:25:18] agree with the prophet we're living in
[1:25:20] the time when the word should have the
[1:25:22] preeminence I believe the time Amen to
[1:25:24] lay our side our Creeds lay aside our
[1:25:26] faults amen and come back to the word
[1:25:29] that time is right now that time is not
[1:25:32] in the future that time is not in the
[1:25:34] past that time is right now now you may
[1:25:37] say why would it be so important a meant
[1:25:39] to lay aside our Creeds and to lay aside
[1:25:41] our faults amen and come back to the
[1:25:43] word well the prophet of God said
[1:25:45] because the word is our headship amen
[1:25:48] the word is our headship he said the
[1:25:50] body therefore cannot recognize any
[1:25:52] other headship but the word see because
[1:25:55] the head is connected with the body and
[1:25:58] the head is the word it's the same word
[1:26:00] it's one headship he said therefore
[1:26:02] denominations and holy fathers and
[1:26:05] everything else is dead dung he said
[1:26:07] there is one headship and that is Christ
[1:26:09] amen amen there is one body in that body
[1:26:12] only recognizes amen one thing and that
[1:26:16] is the word again he says our headship
[1:26:19] is in heaven now when a prophet's
[1:26:21] preaching this there is an argument
[1:26:23] going on is the headship in Rome is the
[1:26:25] headship here but a prophet identified
[1:26:27] with the headship of the body is he said
[1:26:30] the headship of the body is in heaven he
[1:26:33] said therefore I'm not going to Rome
[1:26:34] when I die he said I'm going to heaven
[1:26:37] when I die amen because the headship is
[1:26:40] in heaven amen I want to say this to you
[1:26:42] tonight friends our headship is not in
[1:26:45] Jeffersonville our headship is not in
[1:26:47] Tucson our headship is not in Tennessee
[1:26:49] our headship is not in Virginia it's not
[1:26:52] in come on Church our headship is not in
[1:26:54] Arkansas our heads our headship is in
[1:26:58] heaven that if our headship is in heaven
[1:27:00] wherever the head is amen the body is
[1:27:03] following the head and wherever the head
[1:27:06] is there the body will be also amen I
[1:27:08] want to tell you tonight you may be in
[1:27:10] some situations that look impossible you
[1:27:13] may be facing some things it looks like
[1:27:14] there's no way to change amen but if
[1:27:17] your headship is in heaven amen lift up
[1:27:19] your head and remember amen that there
[1:27:22] is a Rapture coming for the church there
[1:27:24] is a body change let me say this plane
[1:27:26] as I know how things will not Remain the
[1:27:29] way they are always amen but there's a
[1:27:32] problem promise for a change because our
[1:27:35] headship is in heaven and if our
[1:27:37] headship is in heaven we're not headed
[1:27:38] to hell if our headship is in heaven
[1:27:40] we're not on our way to the tribulation
[1:27:42] if our headship is in heaven we're not
[1:27:45] headed to the battle of Armageddon if
[1:27:47] our headship is in heaven we are on our
[1:27:50] way to heaven I think it's high time to
[1:27:53] remember who we are I think it's time to
[1:27:55] forget what we've been through and what
[1:27:57] we've done and remember our headship is
[1:27:59] in heaven and if the head is recognized
[1:28:02] then the body will be recognized if the
[1:28:05] head is glorified then the body will be
[1:28:08] glorified and whom he is predestinated
[1:28:11] he is Justified and he's already
[1:28:14] glorified amen then I'll say to you
[1:28:16] tonight we do not need feelings we do
[1:28:19] not need emotions we do not seek
[1:28:21] sensation we do not need the feeling to
[1:28:24] get right to take a Rapture the prophet
[1:28:26] said the bride takes the Rapture by the
[1:28:28] word
[1:28:29] the bride takes a Rapture by the word
[1:28:32] and the headship of the body is the word
[1:28:35] he said we don't need a credential from
[1:28:37] some church you don't need a
[1:28:39] denomination to back you up you need the
[1:28:42] word to take for Rapture with it you
[1:28:45] don't need some credential you don't
[1:28:46] need some long history of some school to
[1:28:49] be healed this morning you need to
[1:28:51] accept that word amen the word is what
[1:28:54] does the work amen you don't need a
[1:28:56] resume to be recognized as a son or a
[1:28:59] daughter of God you don't need some
[1:29:01] preacher backing you to be recognized as
[1:29:04] a member of the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:29:06] amen but the god of Heaven has come into
[1:29:09] this generation and he has revealed his
[1:29:12] word and his word has claimed you listen
[1:29:15] friends amen you're not accepting this
[1:29:17] Rapture this Rapture is accepting you
[1:29:21] you're not working your way into it
[1:29:23] you're not going to fast your way into
[1:29:25] it you're not going to pray your way
[1:29:27] into it come on I'm gonna preach tonight
[1:29:29] you're not going to read enough books
[1:29:31] and memorize enough scriptures and get a
[1:29:33] good Sunday School record going to make
[1:29:35] this Rapture the only way you'll make
[1:29:37] this Rapture is if before the foundation
[1:29:40] of the world your name is on the Lamb's
[1:29:43] Book of Life and you have been connected
[1:29:45] to the headship of the body amen I'll
[1:29:48] say this plain as I know how this world
[1:29:50] has fallen apart
[1:29:52] there is a kingdom coming amen I'll go
[1:29:55] and say it there's not a kingdom coming
[1:29:56] there's a kingdom here and then there's
[1:29:59] a bride here amen and she is in power
[1:30:02] and she's not looking at her problems
[1:30:04] she's not looking at her sicknesses
[1:30:06] she's not looking at what's happening
[1:30:07] around her amen the world conditions has
[1:30:11] moved her into Focus mode on the Rapture
[1:30:14] that's the only thing she can think
[1:30:15] about it's the only thing she can preach
[1:30:18] about it's the only thing she can pray
[1:30:20] about amen because there's nowhere else
[1:30:22] to go for this bride amen but where the
[1:30:25] head is amen the product of God said it
[1:30:28] very plain he said then what's going to
[1:30:29] happen is we're going to be called up
[1:30:31] together how many is looking forward to
[1:30:33] that to meet the Lord in the air he said
[1:30:36] think of it missing people you can't see
[1:30:39] him no more but you're getting together
[1:30:41] with the rest of the group amen so this
[1:30:43] is a group this is a body this is not a
[1:30:46] big eye and a little you this is a body
[1:30:49] coming together for translation him he
[1:30:52] said then we which are alive and remain
[1:30:54] to the coming of the Lord shall not
[1:30:55] prevent or hinder those which are asleep
[1:30:58] see they're not dead amen Christians
[1:31:01] don't die amen they're just taking a
[1:31:03] little rest amen seeing the Trump of God
[1:31:05] shall say them and the dead in Christ
[1:31:07] shall rise first and appear to many and
[1:31:10] all at once you happen to look amen and
[1:31:13] see well there's a brother and you know
[1:31:15] it ain't going to be long when you see
[1:31:18] loved ones appearing amen it is a direct
[1:31:21] evidence that the time of change is upon
[1:31:24] the church in a few moments will be
[1:31:26] changed in a moment in the tweaking of
[1:31:28] an eye amen and to think with all that
[1:31:30] we have seen in the scripture and the
[1:31:33] clear-cut vindications of the hour that
[1:31:35] we're living in it could happen before
[1:31:37] this service ends tonight well I think
[1:31:40] that's a good point to shout on Amen
[1:31:42] that the Rapture is not a Million Miles
[1:31:44] Away amen it's not in some far-off
[1:31:47] Galaxy amen but the Rapture could happen
[1:31:50] right here in party Arkansas and around
[1:31:53] the world tonight because the word has
[1:31:56] been fulfilled to bring on Rapture amen
[1:31:59] just think of that this night the
[1:32:01] Rapture could take place now when you
[1:32:03] start talking about this let's say what
[1:32:04] a prophet said he said we believe there
[1:32:07] will be a Rapture amen if you don't
[1:32:09] believe in Rapture a bad place to be
[1:32:10] tonight we believe there will be a
[1:32:12] Rapture amen all Christians believe that
[1:32:15] amen that's Bible readers believe there
[1:32:18] will be a Rapture so if you're not a
[1:32:20] Bible reader then we don't know what
[1:32:21] you're believing but if you're a Bible
[1:32:23] reader and a student of a prophet we
[1:32:25] know exactly what you're believing
[1:32:27] you're believing the word that was in
[1:32:29] the alpha has come over into the Omega
[1:32:32] and is manifesting itself for change now
[1:32:34] many don't believe these things and I
[1:32:36] can't help they don't believe it and
[1:32:38] neither can you but because they just
[1:32:40] don't believe it does not mean I don't
[1:32:42] have I can't believe it come on now amen
[1:32:45] if somebody don't want to believe in
[1:32:46] healing that's fine but I still believe
[1:32:48] in healing if somebody don't want to
[1:32:50] believe in real Revelation that's fine
[1:32:52] amen but I still believe that spiritual
[1:32:54] Revelation amen is God's provided way a
[1:32:58] mental weapon devil anywhere Anytime
[1:33:00] Anyplace under any condition I tell you
[1:33:03] what we need we don't need a church full
[1:33:04] of feelings we don't need a church full
[1:33:06] of gifts we don't need a church Fuller I
[1:33:08] say so no we need a church full of the
[1:33:11] word in order by the message of the hour
[1:33:14] to change our bodies in the moment in
[1:33:17] the twinkling of an eye I still believe
[1:33:19] in the gifts I can't help some don't but
[1:33:21] I thank God he sent a prophet to put him
[1:33:23] in order
[1:33:24] there's many Protestants he says that do
[1:33:27] not believe this they don't believe in
[1:33:29] the physical Resurrection when the man
[1:33:31] breaks in this he said Protestants don't
[1:33:32] believe it he said some Catholics don't
[1:33:34] he said then that's why I've got to be
[1:33:36] Full Gospel he said I have to believe
[1:33:39] what the word says He said now I believe
[1:33:41] in the literal death and burial and
[1:33:44] resurrection and second coming all is
[1:33:46] Christ Jesus I believe that he's fully
[1:33:48] Christ he's the same Jesus that will
[1:33:51] return and I believe Amen in the person
[1:33:54] of the Holy Ghost and he's here now hey
[1:33:57] amen he's not coming amen he's here now
[1:34:00] his spirit is here amen his life is
[1:34:03] moving in the church he said there is a
[1:34:06] heaven and there is a literal Jesus
[1:34:08] Christ and that will come into a body
[1:34:10] form to receive his church to himself no
[1:34:13] matter how old the story seems it's
[1:34:16] still the truth amen that's what God
[1:34:18] said he said that's what Believers
[1:34:21] believe you want to know what Believers
[1:34:23] Believe We Believe amen that some
[1:34:26] morning between six and nine amen Jesus
[1:34:29] Christ the son of God will come in a
[1:34:31] form and he will take his bride away
[1:34:33] from Old Church we're not sitting back
[1:34:36] playing church we are on the verge of a
[1:34:38] body change
[1:34:40] if there's not a Rapture friends then
[1:34:42] where are we at what are we doing we're
[1:34:44] age are we living in what promise do we
[1:34:46] have can we say what a prophet said
[1:34:48] there's going to be a Rapture well we
[1:34:52] might as well shout hallelujah right
[1:34:53] there there's going to be a Rapture amen
[1:34:56] and the Bible says there will be and
[1:34:59] it's only for the elected the elected
[1:35:01] lady the bride in this last days that's
[1:35:04] been pulled out of the church that's
[1:35:07] only going to be a change for the
[1:35:10] elected lady that's been pulled out of
[1:35:13] the church I love what a prophet says he
[1:35:15] said there will be a resurrection of the
[1:35:16] dead he will confirm it there will be a
[1:35:19] Rapture of the church how's it going to
[1:35:21] be I don't know but he'll prove it
[1:35:23] because his words are true he said there
[1:35:26] will be a millennium and he'll prove it
[1:35:28] amen there will be a new heavens and a
[1:35:30] new Earth and he'll prove it because his
[1:35:33] word said so are you ready for this and
[1:35:36] only the righteous will be there only
[1:35:38] the ones that's been made up part of
[1:35:41] this word see well their part in their
[1:35:43] position in this word for this age will
[1:35:46] be the only ones that will be there so
[1:35:48] we might as well Rejoice that the enemy
[1:35:51] is not going to be there our adversary
[1:35:53] is not going to be there brother Danny's
[1:35:56] sickness is not going to be there
[1:35:57] heartache is not going to be there
[1:36:00] misunderstandings and disagreements and
[1:36:02] all kinds of confusions it's not going
[1:36:05] to be there as a matter of fact my Bible
[1:36:07] says that the righteous is going to walk
[1:36:09] out upon the ashes of a wicked I'm
[1:36:12] talking about a bride who has found or
[1:36:14] placed in the word and there ain't
[1:36:16] enough devils in hell to back her off of
[1:36:18] her position she knows where she's going
[1:36:21] she knows where her headship is her
[1:36:24] headship is in heaven
[1:36:26] and she is the image of the word and
[1:36:29] only the True Believers in his word know
[1:36:31] this
[1:36:32] only the True Believers in his word know
[1:36:35] this and can believe it watch a prophet
[1:36:38] turn and God helps them to prove it so
[1:36:42] only a Believer can know it and only God
[1:36:45] can give you the grace to prove it come
[1:36:47] on church only a Believer can know the
[1:36:50] secret sudden catching away of the Bride
[1:36:53] but only God can give you the grace to
[1:36:55] prove it that's right amen that is the
[1:36:58] truth how many would agree with me the
[1:37:00] time of rapture is at hand Prophet said
[1:37:03] a man asked me a few moments ago about
[1:37:05] Su coming in the Rapture we've lived the
[1:37:07] time out the time of the Rapture is at
[1:37:09] hand we're looking for a Rapture in
[1:37:11] faith amen that can pull the church
[1:37:13] together now that is the basis of
[1:37:15] Fellowship for the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:37:18] amen it's not my idea your idea your
[1:37:21] direction my Direction but for basis of
[1:37:23] Fellowship for the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:37:26] is the shout of first Thessalonians 4
[1:37:28] it's the message to gather the bride he
[1:37:31] said and give it some Supernatural
[1:37:33] strength amen that can change the bodies
[1:37:36] that we live in amen that when light
[1:37:38] flashes from the sky and the trumpet
[1:37:41] sounds they've been the body of Christ
[1:37:43] somebody say that with me the body of
[1:37:45] Christ will be quickly gathered together
[1:37:48] and changed in a moment and taken into
[1:37:51] heaven listen friends there's a
[1:37:53] gathering happening now but there's also
[1:37:55] a trumpet Gathering of first
[1:37:57] Thessalonians 4 do you realize why it's
[1:38:00] going to be in a moment in the twinkling
[1:38:02] of an eye because on the morning of the
[1:38:05] Rapture it's not the Awakening of the
[1:38:07] Bride it's the Gathering of the Bride
[1:38:09] the bride was awakened under the seventh
[1:38:12] Angels Ministry amen but when the
[1:38:14] seventh angel amen would sound the
[1:38:16] mystery of gods would be finished and
[1:38:18] there would be a bride who would be in
[1:38:20] March and order she with thee back in
[1:38:22] divine order she would be back on this
[1:38:24] side of the Victor's March listen
[1:38:27] friends it could happen right now
[1:38:28] because the bride by the word is back in
[1:38:31] position to meet her Lord amen you can
[1:38:34] now that you can scoff it you can make
[1:38:36] fun of it but you can't outrun it
[1:38:39] you can let the devil talk in your ear
[1:38:41] you can let the devil tell you you'll
[1:38:43] never make it but the devil's about two
[1:38:45] here come on that that was about 50 some
[1:38:48] years too late because the message of
[1:38:51] the hour is a claiming message it's not
[1:38:54] an education message it's not a
[1:38:56] Pentecostal idea the message of the hour
[1:38:59] is a claiming message that when you hear
[1:39:02] the message amen William Branham didn't
[1:39:04] claim you amen I didn't claim you but
[1:39:07] for word that was being revealed in the
[1:39:09] season that you're living would claim
[1:39:11] you I'll tell you what the prophet said
[1:39:13] he said every child of God that hears
[1:39:16] these tapes May at that time he said I
[1:39:19] claim them for the kingdom of God he
[1:39:21] said upon the basis of knowing this amen
[1:39:24] it's the word that's being revealed what
[1:39:27] is claiming the bride is the word that's
[1:39:31] being revealed come on there's a hundred
[1:39:33] million people carrying the same Bible
[1:39:35] you're carrying and they're falling
[1:39:37] apart they're going
[1:39:39] come on they're going to the same doctor
[1:39:41] same schools and their lives are falling
[1:39:44] apart you know why because they've got
[1:39:46] the word but in this age under the voice
[1:39:48] of the seventh angel it would be the
[1:39:51] return not just of the word but the god
[1:39:54] of the word in other words we don't just
[1:39:56] have the word we have the author of the
[1:39:59] word we have the perfect interpretation
[1:40:02] of the word of God with Divine
[1:40:05] vindication
[1:40:07] this message didn't play you didn't
[1:40:09] claim this message this message claimed
[1:40:11] you and I'll go and say they didn't
[1:40:13] claim you on accident it claimed you on
[1:40:15] purpose I know a lot of fangs tried to
[1:40:17] claim you amen but suicide couldn't
[1:40:19] claim you cause the message already
[1:40:21] claimed you depression couldn't claim
[1:40:23] you because the message already claimed
[1:40:25] you amen Brooks tried to claim you but
[1:40:28] they could not claim you because there
[1:40:30] was a greater claim of the unmerited
[1:40:33] favor of almighty God upon your life
[1:40:35] come on church you can run but you can't
[1:40:38] hide if he's gonna take you out of here
[1:40:40] he's gonna do it no matter what the
[1:40:42] devil does to stop it I want to
[1:40:44] pronounce to you there is nothing that
[1:40:46] will stop this Rapture it's already in
[1:40:49] motion it's already in progress the
[1:40:52] Rapture is in the church and the church
[1:40:54] is in the word
[1:40:55] that'll change your body yes sir this is
[1:40:59] not just a bunch of getting together and
[1:41:00] shouting and hollering and running
[1:41:02] around the building they've been this is
[1:41:04] claiming message this is revelation
[1:41:06] claiming time amen you say preacher I
[1:41:08] think we need to hold back on our
[1:41:09] meetings well I think we need to have
[1:41:11] more
[1:41:12] I think if there's ever been a time to
[1:41:15] have a meeting amen Now's the Time to
[1:41:17] have it if there's ever been a time to
[1:41:19] preach this message amen Now's the Time
[1:41:21] to preach it you know why because 50
[1:41:23] years ago we were talking about it
[1:41:25] people were preaching it but nobody was
[1:41:27] understanding it amen but through the
[1:41:29] maturity of the spirit of God there has
[1:41:32] come a maturity upon this bride and
[1:41:34] we're no longer talking about a future
[1:41:37] Brides Revival we got people standing up
[1:41:39] in the middle of our meeting say it I am
[1:41:42] the badge Revival I am the manifestation
[1:41:45] of the opening of a word in the e-time
[1:41:48] living in I'm not backing up turning
[1:41:50] around I'm gonna claim my promises I'm
[1:41:53] gonna claim my inheritance
[1:41:57] I'm talking about a people who has been
[1:42:00] claimed by the revelation of God
[1:42:04] [Applause]
[1:42:07] there ain't a marriage coming it's
[1:42:08] already happened
[1:42:10] a preacher someday somehow or sometime
[1:42:12] even the marriage has happened now
[1:42:15] I'm on Church we're not leaving here and
[1:42:17] going to a wedding supper we're going to
[1:42:20] a wedding supper in the skies let me
[1:42:23] rephrase that we're not leaving here and
[1:42:24] going to a wedding we're going to a
[1:42:27] wedding supper
[1:42:29] you say can you prove that I can
[1:42:30] invisible Union the prophet of God stood
[1:42:33] there and married you to that new
[1:42:34] anointed word listen William Marion
[1:42:37] Branham the seventh angel preached your
[1:42:40] wedding ceremony he married you to
[1:42:43] Christ he introduced you hello church he
[1:42:47] introduced you as Mrs Jesus Christ he
[1:42:51] did not introduce you as Miss Baptist he
[1:42:53] didn't introduce you as Miss Pentecostal
[1:42:55] he turned you around and said five stars
[1:42:58] lined up to announce the infancy of the
[1:43:01] Bride upon the Earth but may I say
[1:43:03] tonight that bride is no longer an
[1:43:05] infancy she is in maturity by the
[1:43:08] revelation of the word of God
[1:43:12] I'm not crazy I've not lost my mind I've
[1:43:16] recognized my headship
[1:43:18] the marriage of the Lamb is come and his
[1:43:22] wife has made herself ready how can you
[1:43:26] make yourself ready unless there's
[1:43:28] something to make yourself ready by
[1:43:31] you cannot make yourself ready unless
[1:43:34] there's something to prepare yourself by
[1:43:36] so the same message amen that calls you
[1:43:39] out as the bride is the same message
[1:43:42] that will prepare you as the word bride
[1:43:44] to meet the word groom you say what is
[1:43:47] this hour this message of the hour
[1:43:49] probably God said they're getting at is
[1:43:51] a God's promise of this hour of what he
[1:43:53] promised to do now I don't know about
[1:43:55] you but I believe that we're living in
[1:43:57] the hour of preparation
[1:43:59] the prophet said something beautiful he
[1:44:01] said if there ever was a time that the
[1:44:04] world ought to be preparing for the
[1:44:06] second coming of Christ is now Junction
[1:44:09] of time he said Noah was working away he
[1:44:11] was not only performing a miracle but he
[1:44:14] was also looking for a miracle he said
[1:44:16] in the church today as it's laboring
[1:44:19] away under the task of preaching the
[1:44:20] gospel with the signs and wonders of
[1:44:22] following amen they are preparing for a
[1:44:25] miracle listen what this miracle is it's
[1:44:27] the Rapture of the church and the going
[1:44:30] home he said see preparing people
[1:44:33] getting them alive that's what these
[1:44:34] meetings are for is to get you light to
[1:44:37] get you unburdened from the things of
[1:44:39] the world and get their soul set in the
[1:44:43] presence of God that when Jesus does
[1:44:45] appear the second time in glory
[1:44:47] those who are ready amen will Rapture
[1:44:50] and be called up together to meet him in
[1:44:52] the air and be with him now can I take a
[1:44:55] can I take a holy ghost fist to the
[1:44:57] devil can I punch the Devils that devil
[1:45:00] has told you amen that the Rapture some
[1:45:02] hard he's told you the Rapture something
[1:45:04] real burdensome but listen to the
[1:45:06] prophet he said just give me a church
[1:45:08] that's ready that is visualized to see
[1:45:10] signs and to see the omnipotent God and
[1:45:13] the great power of God moving amongst
[1:45:15] the people he said which the Rapture
[1:45:17] will be an easy thing when Jesus comes
[1:45:20] well glory to God somebody say we don't
[1:45:23] want no signs and wonders in our church
[1:45:24] then when the Rapture takes place it's
[1:45:27] going to be hard for you but
[1:45:29] I'm so preach I'm here amen somebody say
[1:45:32] well Mark 16 is no longer in action by
[1:45:34] what Authority do you disqualify the
[1:45:37] identification of the true church that
[1:45:39] God claims as his home he said from
[1:45:41] Genesis to Revelation the True Churches
[1:45:44] of Mark 16 church I'm on Church you know
[1:45:47] what happens under Mark 16 a change
[1:45:50] takes place a sick person becomes well a
[1:45:53] bound person becomes free oh God
[1:45:56] hallelujah that's why the Rapture will
[1:45:59] be an easy thing amen cause some of you
[1:46:01] know what it's like to be bound and in
[1:46:03] just a few moments in the presence of
[1:46:05] God to be released from the bondage and
[1:46:07] defilement of sin and unbelief of own
[1:46:10] church we might as well enjoy Mark 16
[1:46:12] it's going to change her body because
[1:46:15] the same God that wrote Mark 16 is the
[1:46:18] same God that's going to rap to the
[1:46:20] church
[1:46:21] [Applause]
[1:46:22] I'm gonna go ahead and say it we're not
[1:46:24] gonna start believing the message on the
[1:46:26] morning of the Rapture we're already
[1:46:28] believing the message
[1:46:31] we're already believing the message
[1:46:33] we're not going to go find the tape on
[1:46:36] the morning the Rapture brother Stewart
[1:46:37] the tape found us and the word we heard
[1:46:41] he claimed their bodies
[1:46:45] then in other words I can tell you
[1:46:46] tonight we're not waiting to get ready
[1:46:48] we're already ready probably God said I
[1:46:51] don't see anything to hinder the time of
[1:46:52] the coming of the Lord Jesus outside of
[1:46:55] the Readiness of the church now we're
[1:46:57] living in a time where the prophet of
[1:46:59] God said God is preparing a people which
[1:47:01] is a body Amen to believe all things
[1:47:03] Amen in other words it's a time that
[1:47:05] he's bringing people into adoption now
[1:47:07] he said now what we need is the spirit
[1:47:09] of God Amen to raise a standard what is
[1:47:12] it he's pouring in his Spirit he said
[1:47:15] now watch the church the church is
[1:47:17] waiting on me and you adoption time when
[1:47:20] God can pour into us his fullness his
[1:47:22] power his resurrection I love these next
[1:47:25] words that when the church and Christ
[1:47:27] become so close together till Christ
[1:47:31] becomes visible Among Us and raises the
[1:47:34] dead and brother Jeff we go in the
[1:47:36] Rapture then one of the final signs you
[1:47:39] will see before the translation of the
[1:47:41] church is the unity of the of the head
[1:47:44] and the body to where they become so
[1:47:47] close that you can't tell them apart
[1:47:50] come on Church oh that was in God he
[1:47:54] poured into Christ and all that was in
[1:47:57] Christ he poured into the church see
[1:48:00] then the unity of the faith is coming
[1:48:02] from the word that's why the bride is
[1:48:04] not preparing amen by end time signs
[1:48:07] she's not studying Blood Moons she's not
[1:48:10] come on she's not studying astrology
[1:48:11] amen she's not all called up and into
[1:48:14] what this eschatology teacher is saying
[1:48:16] she has heard a message and that message
[1:48:19] has notified her of modern events made
[1:48:22] clear by prophecy and the things that
[1:48:25] are to be in other words this message is
[1:48:27] not just the coming of the lord it's the
[1:48:30] appearing of the Lord he said his Spirit
[1:48:32] working among them ain't been proven
[1:48:34] that it's him amen getting them ready
[1:48:36] for the Rapture for the coming of the
[1:48:39] Lord if there's ever been a time Amen to
[1:48:42] cast off the works of darkness and put
[1:48:44] on the armor of Lights he said there the
[1:48:46] day the time is now this day cause there
[1:48:49] may not be a tomorrow listen that's why
[1:48:52] we should let Services just come and go
[1:48:55] and just be casual and I might as well
[1:48:57] preach I'm here we we shouldn't just let
[1:49:00] our church attendance become casual they
[1:49:02] said we're not denominationals
[1:49:06] we're not charismatics we're not Dr
[1:49:08] Dobson followers we're in time message
[1:49:11] Believers and the word says that we
[1:49:14] should not forsake the assembling of
[1:49:16] ourselves together they've been that
[1:49:18] much more as you see the day approaching
[1:49:21] but I'm gonna go ahead and preach since
[1:49:22] I'm this close to it let's bring back
[1:49:24] Church attendance and let's make Church
[1:49:26] attendance great again what about it why
[1:49:29] don't we make Church attendance amen I
[1:49:31] know it's on the end of your schedule I
[1:49:33] know it's something you get to when you
[1:49:35] ain't got nowhere else to go amen but if
[1:49:37] you got to catch a word and cancel
[1:49:39] soccer and cancel football and baseball
[1:49:41] you ought to make the house of God the
[1:49:44] preeminence of your family the
[1:49:46] preeminence of your ministry
[1:49:48] come on church I think it's time to make
[1:49:51] good Holy Ghost Field standard living
[1:49:53] back in the church
[1:49:54] [Applause]
[1:49:57] I know hell come on church I know we got
[1:50:00] to where church is just something here
[1:50:01] but it shouldn't be it should be our
[1:50:04] focus it should be our everything
[1:50:06] [Applause]
[1:50:08] if you're living under the expectations
[1:50:09] of rapture then you're not going to be
[1:50:11] acting like a laodicean claiming the
[1:50:13] Rapture could happen before the services
[1:50:15] dismissed
[1:50:17] well glory to God I feel good you know
[1:50:20] why I feel good because I'm under the
[1:50:22] message and the message delivered me
[1:50:24] from being a laodicea and lukewarm sin
[1:50:27] loving amen pleasure seeking amen person
[1:50:30] I have been changed by the revelation of
[1:50:33] the word I now know that Christ is the
[1:50:35] principal theme of My Talking he's the
[1:50:37] principal theme of my preaching he's the
[1:50:39] principal faith if Christ is not the
[1:50:42] principal theme of your entire life and
[1:50:44] tear down the foundation and move your
[1:50:46] family back on the foundation of the
[1:50:49] preeminence of Jesus Christ
[1:50:51] [Applause]
[1:50:53] [Music]
[1:50:55] that's a little straight well I don't
[1:50:57] think we got straight enough
[1:50:59] we ought to make the house of God
[1:51:00] important again
[1:51:02] [Applause]
[1:51:03] I know what I'm behind no that's not a
[1:51:06] person it's a spirit and I'm not afraid
[1:51:07] of that spirit because it come from the
[1:51:09] pits of hell and it's going back to the
[1:51:10] pits of Hell there's going to be a
[1:51:12] faithful people
[1:51:16] wellander I don't know well if a Rapture
[1:51:18] could happen and you got to change your
[1:51:20] identity from laodicea to word
[1:51:23] is not going in the rapture
[1:51:26] she rejected the Rapture she rejected
[1:51:29] the Revelation she put the Rapture on
[1:51:31] the outside of her church and still
[1:51:33] hollers raps forever service but that's
[1:51:35] what the prophet said he said it could
[1:51:37] happen amen before this service ends now
[1:51:40] I'm just gonna I'm gonna deal with this
[1:51:41] for a second amen because I think we
[1:51:43] ought to be able to say Amen no matter
[1:51:44] what the preacher's preaching if it's
[1:51:46] coming from the message
[1:51:48] I know we got certain points now we amen
[1:51:51] and we got certain areas amen but
[1:51:53] whatever happened to whatever the word
[1:51:55] come forth we just simply said amen
[1:52:00] well I don't like it well we still said
[1:52:02] amen come on man glory to God it's
[1:52:05] Saturday night and I feel like preaching
[1:52:06] I think we need to bring our amens back
[1:52:08] in the house of God when the Holy Ghost
[1:52:10] comes in the service and begins to cut
[1:52:13] away sin we ought to say Amen well I'm a
[1:52:15] preacher for a second amen when God
[1:52:17] anoints your pastors Amen to stand in
[1:52:19] the pulpit and to preach against sin and
[1:52:22] to preach against ungodliness amen come
[1:52:24] on fathers amen you ought to have a
[1:52:26] backbone to say Amen
[1:52:27] [Applause]
[1:52:29] I know what I'm talking about it's got
[1:52:31] to work now if a preacher says anything
[1:52:33] but some little devil comes in and he's
[1:52:35] out of place he shouldn't say it amen
[1:52:37] since when did preaching the word in the
[1:52:39] pup head get out of place if we're going
[1:52:42] to take a Rapture we're going to take it
[1:52:43] by the word and the only thing that will
[1:52:46] prepare us for the Rapture is the word
[1:52:48] it's got to cut away the Hollywood it's
[1:52:51] gonna cut away the entertainment it's
[1:52:53] gonna cut away everything I say oh God
[1:52:55] cut away everything I want to be Rapture
[1:52:58] at it I want to be ready for a Rapture
[1:53:01] if I gotta forsake friendships if I
[1:53:03] gotta forsake this and forsake that I'm
[1:53:05] willing to do it God I don't want to
[1:53:08] miss the change of my body
[1:53:10] [Applause]
[1:53:11] we're on the verge of it friends it's in
[1:53:14] this building right now I'm not a crazy
[1:53:17] man but for Rapture oh God it's in this
[1:53:20] building right now the power to change
[1:53:23] our bodies is in this building right now
[1:53:26] you know what you're bumping into you're
[1:53:28] bumping into translation power now
[1:53:31] listen if we're this close to change let
[1:53:33] me show you how close the world is to
[1:53:35] destruction he said we're on the verge
[1:53:37] of the greatest shaking that the world
[1:53:39] has ever received they said this one 58
[1:53:42] he said the nation is on the verge of
[1:53:45] going into ashes at any minute at any
[1:53:48] minute America could be ashes and crater
[1:53:51] he said listen amen it happened before
[1:53:54] morning if translation can happen before
[1:53:57] morning destruction can happen
[1:54:02] Colby if destruction can hit this nation
[1:54:05] and before mourning the nation be
[1:54:07] craters then don't tell me that on a
[1:54:10] Saturday night meeting that's the power
[1:54:12] of the Holy Ghost cannot come into a
[1:54:14] building amen and anointed group of
[1:54:16] people and change their bodies from the
[1:54:19] inside out
[1:54:19] [Applause]
[1:54:21] Where Do We Go From Here the prophet
[1:54:23] asks the question where do we go from
[1:54:24] here he said well there's only one book
[1:54:25] that'll tell us where to go he said and
[1:54:27] that's the Bible he said now watch it
[1:54:30] tells you where you come from it tells
[1:54:32] you you're here and it tells you where
[1:54:34] you're going so therefore there oh we
[1:54:36] want to know we're from here let's take
[1:54:38] a look at the only book that can tell us
[1:54:41] the only book that can tell us brother
[1:54:43] Forrest where we're going at from here
[1:54:46] is the Bible which is the road map which
[1:54:49] a prophet identified is the road map
[1:54:51] from the cradle all the way to the grave
[1:54:53] but here's the beautiful thing about it
[1:54:55] brother Danny in the last days there's a
[1:54:58] people that's not going to go to the
[1:54:59] Grave thank you
[1:55:02] there's a people that's not going to go
[1:55:04] to a funeral home in the last days
[1:55:07] there's a people who's going to be in
[1:55:09] authority and Power by the revelation of
[1:55:12] Christ and she's going to be changed in
[1:55:15] the moment of The Tweak of an eye but
[1:55:16] remember said how be he reads John 16 13
[1:55:18] I hit it Thursday albeit when he the
[1:55:20] spirit of Truth has come he will what he
[1:55:22] will guide you into all truth he shall
[1:55:25] not speak of himself amen but whatsoever
[1:55:27] he shall hear amen that shall he speak
[1:55:30] and he will show you thanks to come
[1:55:32] Robin says in other words Allah says
[1:55:35] that he'll be the one that will reveal
[1:55:37] the thing you see in other words the
[1:55:40] spirit of truth will be the one who
[1:55:42] reveals the thing you see then he goes
[1:55:45] to the seventh seal he says in paragraph
[1:55:47] 43 he says now heavenly father as this
[1:55:49] goes forward now to preach or teach on
[1:55:51] this Great Mighty event that take place
[1:55:53] in glory some 2000 years ago was given
[1:55:56] to the great beloved Apostle John and
[1:55:58] tonight we're to speak upon it he said
[1:56:01] let the Holy Spirit it come forward now
[1:56:03] somebody say now in his mighty power of
[1:56:06] a revelation that he might reveal to us
[1:56:08] the thing which he wants us to know as
[1:56:11] he has in these last few nights I'll
[1:56:14] come on the prophet of God right there
[1:56:16] just dismiss the idea that the seventh
[1:56:18] seal is not open he said he did it in
[1:56:20] the previous nights he's going to come
[1:56:22] into the building tonight in the power
[1:56:25] of Revelation and he's going to reveal
[1:56:27] to us the thing that he wants us to know
[1:56:29] do you know what he was wanting us to
[1:56:31] know brother window is that the book is
[1:56:33] already opened he's wanting us to know
[1:56:35] amen that the Revelation is already
[1:56:38] available
[1:56:40] who went there say that wasn't inspired
[1:56:42] word can I have some Liberty now was it
[1:56:44] the inspired word of God when he
[1:56:46] foretold it here sent out yondered
[1:56:48] Arizona brought it right back even with
[1:56:50] science everything else and proved it so
[1:56:52] here's his own words the book is already
[1:56:54] opened that's right listen his next line
[1:56:57] just waiting somebody say waiting for
[1:57:00] the seventh seal to be identified amen
[1:57:03] of the coming of Christ he did not say
[1:57:05] waiting for the seventh seal to be
[1:57:07] opened he said waiting for the seventh
[1:57:09] seal to be identified which is the
[1:57:12] coming of Christ now the prophet of God
[1:57:14] identifies to the church that it was
[1:57:16] under the third pool that the revelation
[1:57:18] of those seals which would take
[1:57:20] preeminence in a body to change the body
[1:57:23] would be revealed he said first pool was
[1:57:25] healing second pull was prophesied but
[1:57:28] that third pool was the opening of the
[1:57:30] word it was those Mysteries revealed and
[1:57:33] there's no more high order to reveal the
[1:57:35] word than prophets and remember remember
[1:57:37] remember
[1:57:38] the Third was the opening of them Seven
[1:57:42] Seals to reveal the hidden truth that
[1:57:45] has been sealed in the word and what is
[1:57:48] the word the word is the headship then
[1:57:51] the power to change the body was sealed
[1:57:54] in the head but in order to change the
[1:57:56] body it's going to come out of the head
[1:57:58] and it's got to get into the body so God
[1:58:01] sent a prophet according to Revelation
[1:58:03] 10 7 to reveal the secrets
[1:58:07] I hope that devil gets out of here
[1:58:09] running tonight we ain't looking for the
[1:58:11] third pull we're in the third pool we're
[1:58:13] not looking for the revelation of the
[1:58:15] Rapture we're in the revelation
[1:58:18] I know what that Devil's done that
[1:58:20] Devil's brought the Catholicism Spirit
[1:58:22] right around this message and put
[1:58:24] everything on the prophet Greater Works
[1:58:26] on the prophet miracles on the prophet
[1:58:28] amen but have you can you read come on
[1:58:31] can you read you know what they say they
[1:58:33] say well John 14 12 is just brother
[1:58:35] Branham because it says he will do the
[1:58:37] Greater Works okay how far are you going
[1:58:39] to run that because John 5 24 says that
[1:58:42] he has passed from death and alive and
[1:58:44] if he is Holy brother Branham then he's
[1:58:47] the only one that's passed from death
[1:58:48] but I happen not to be a Catholic I
[1:58:51] happen to be a Christian and the word
[1:58:53] says that these signs shall follow them
[1:58:55] that believe and if there's a thief in
[1:58:58] your hearts there's a word to believe
[1:59:00] and there's a people gonna believe it we
[1:59:02] ain't looking for something we are
[1:59:04] what's happening we are not looking for
[1:59:06] Revival we're not pulling from revival
[1:59:08] we are the rich people the Revival is in
[1:59:11] us it's in our flesh it's in our bones
[1:59:17] not a crazy man I'm on the verge of my
[1:59:19] body changing
[1:59:21] it's not in the future brother Mark it's
[1:59:24] right here in this building right now
[1:59:27] I propose to you our God is not dead
[1:59:32] my God is not dead he's not brother Joe
[1:59:35] in the museum he's not in the Tomb in
[1:59:38] Jerusalem he's not in a grave in

[1:59:48] can feel him in my bones I can feel him
[1:59:50] all over me I can feel the anointing of
[1:59:53] the revelation of the word breaking out
[1:59:55] on my body
[1:59:57] and if it feels this good here What's It
[1:59:59] Gonna feel like hair
[2:00:04] you can sit on it but you can't stop it

[2:00:12] [Applause]
[2:00:14] third pull
[2:00:16] is here
[2:00:18] direct quote or brother Andrew when
[2:00:20] squeeze comes persecution sets in let's
[2:00:23] just say what a prophet said it'll be to
[2:00:26] the absolutely total loss but it will be
[2:00:28] for the bride the church
[2:00:33] come on it'll be to the total loss but
[2:00:36] it will be for the Bride of the church
[2:00:38] now can I just I don't I just said as
[2:00:40] plain as I know how the seventh seal is
[2:00:43] the coming of the Lord
[2:00:45] all Bible Believers believe
[2:00:49] the seventh seal is the coming of the
[2:00:52] Lord now the kind of the Lord is going
[2:00:55] to be preached by seventh angel who's
[2:00:57] going to say now my background of the
[2:00:59] Rapture is Psalms 27. he's going to read
[2:01:03] this Asama David the Lord is my light
[2:01:06] and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the
[2:01:10] Lord is the strength of my life of whom
[2:01:12] shall I be afraid when the wicked even
[2:01:15] mine enemies in my foes come upon me to
[2:01:17] eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell
[2:01:20] oh thank you God though a whole
[2:01:22] shouldn't Camp against me my heart shall
[2:01:24] not fear the war should rise against me
[2:01:27] in this will I be confident there is one
[2:01:30] thing have I desire to the Lord and that
[2:01:32] will I seek after that I may dwell in
[2:01:34] the house of the Lord all the days of my
[2:01:37] life to behold the beauty of the Lord
[2:01:39] and to inquire in his Temple are you
[2:01:42] ready for this for in the time of
[2:01:44] trouble
[2:01:45] I had just identified to you the time of
[2:01:48] rapture in the time of trouble for in
[2:01:51] the time of trouble he shall hide me in
[2:01:54] his Pavilion yet come on what was the
[2:01:57] third pull it was not a public show
[2:02:00] come on the first pool was a public show
[2:02:02] the second pull they had impersonator
[2:02:04] but when it come to that third pool It
[2:02:06] could only be manifested in a wrong in
[2:02:10] the heart of the Bride well come on
[2:02:12] church I know they're hollering world
[2:02:14] war three I know the world's falling
[2:02:16] apart but here in Hardy Arkansas and
[2:02:19] around the world tonight there is a
[2:02:21] bride who has been gathered under the
[2:02:23] wings of Jehovah the Great Eagle She's
[2:02:26] Not Afraid she's not nervous she's not
[2:02:29] shaken she's not consumed she knows her
[2:02:32] Lord has hit her
[2:02:35] now now if you're going to go with me in
[2:02:37] this secret it's going to be a rock and
[2:02:40] he said now shall my head be lifted up
[2:02:42] above my enemies round about me
[2:02:43] therefore I preach it's sacrifice of Joy
[2:02:46] I will sing praises of the Lord now
[2:02:48] y'all know what that rock means that
[2:02:50] rock means Revelation in other words
[2:02:53] he's going to pull you he's going to
[2:02:55] draw you he's going to bless you you're
[2:02:58] blessed he's going to bless you and he's
[2:03:01] going to pull you by the revelation of
[2:03:03] the word now come on people say well we
[2:03:05] don't need to preach the cross no more
[2:03:07] brother Daryl well they just all this
[2:03:08] ain't falling a prophet because the
[2:03:10] prophet actually made the cross valuable
[2:03:12] to the church again
[2:03:15] now let's go ahead and preach there the
[2:03:17] world made the cross a movie they made
[2:03:20] the cross a pretty necklace they made
[2:03:22] the cross a place of something fancy but
[2:03:24] when a Prophet come on the scene he said
[2:03:26] it was the place of the atonement for
[2:03:28] the Bride of Jesus Christ listen friends
[2:03:30] without this message F out this message
[2:03:33] we don't even have the least
[2:03:34] understanding of the Cross of Calvary
[2:03:37] but because of this message we're not
[2:03:39] just looking back at what Calvary did
[2:03:41] two thousand years ago but his brother
[2:03:43] Daryl said this morning we're looking at
[2:03:45] what calvary's doing right here in this
[2:03:48] building this evening
[2:03:50] because we're not under an education
[2:03:52] we're under a revelation now the Rapture
[2:03:54] the end of The Province says is a
[2:03:56] revelation to her he said the revelation
[2:03:58] of the true bride of Christ will be
[2:04:00] waiting for that revelation of the
[2:04:02] Rapture I'm not going to read all this
[2:04:03] to you you know him he said it will take
[2:04:04] a prophet he meant to get the Revelation
[2:04:06] now he says in Revelation 10 he said I
[2:04:09] believe those through those seven
[2:04:10] Thunders will be revealed in the last
[2:04:12] days in order to get the bride together
[2:04:14] for Rapture and Faith because what do we
[2:04:17] got right now we wouldn't be able to do
[2:04:19] it he said but we don't know what they
[2:04:21] are yet but my opinion will be revealed
[2:04:22] right away and when it do don't you love
[2:04:25] a prophet's English and when it do it'll
[2:04:28] give faith for that Rapture and Grace
[2:04:31] for that church to move out well glory
[2:04:35] to God it's moving time when the
[2:04:38] revelation of those seven funders will
[2:04:40] be revealed to the bride it will be her
[2:04:43] Exodus papers it will be her leaving
[2:04:45] Leona see a paper this Revelation is
[2:04:48] going to move you amen from time back
[2:04:51] into eternity yes sir we just move
[2:04:54] everything we know of through all the
[2:04:55] nominations dispensation we've seen the
[2:04:58] mysteries of God we've seen the
[2:04:59] appearing but yet there's something in
[2:05:01] there he said we just can't lighten
[2:05:02] ourselves with there's something another
[2:05:04] he said in the breach I love it now it's
[2:05:06] going to be brought to us in Revelation
[2:05:08] somebody say Revelations pray for
[2:05:10] Revelation more than anything
[2:05:12] more than a raise on your job more than
[2:05:14] a better home an Asher car pray for
[2:05:17] Revelation and from the hand of God by
[2:05:20] Divine Vindication he said then we have
[2:05:23] now got the Revelation in the last days
[2:05:25] for the message of the Lord God to
[2:05:28] gather his bride together who is his
[2:05:31] bride his bride is his body so the body
[2:05:34] of the Bride will be gathered by the
[2:05:36] revelation of the word in the seventh
[2:05:39] silly breaks in paragraph 390. he says
[2:05:41] now do you notice on the opening of the
[2:05:43] seventh seal it's also a threefold
[2:05:45] mystery he said the one I will speak and
[2:05:47] have spoke is a mystery of the seven
[2:05:49] Thunders he set the seven Thunders will
[2:05:52] unfold this mystery it'll be right at
[2:05:54] the coming of Christ because Christ said
[2:05:57] no one would know when he would return
[2:05:58] He said did you notice when the Jews
[2:06:01] asked him they compare the scripture
[2:06:02] Matthew 24 with the seven seal was left
[2:06:05] out because see Christ said only God
[2:06:07] himself knowed not even the angels see
[2:06:10] no wonder it wasn't even written you see
[2:06:12] they they hush nothing could take place
[2:06:14] Angels didn't know it didn't anybody
[2:06:16] know when he was coming but there'll be
[2:06:18] seven voices of these Thunders that will
[2:06:21] reveal the great Revelation at that time
[2:06:23] now I know people took that quote and
[2:06:25] said there's going to be seven different
[2:06:26] men seven different voices but a prophet
[2:06:29] he he goes right over that and says it's
[2:06:31] not in one man it's not one man taking
[2:06:34] each Thunder amen it's the word
[2:06:37] unveiling itself and sounding Out to the
[2:06:39] bride he said I believe if we don't know
[2:06:42] it it won't be no to that time but it
[2:06:44] will reveal in that day in the hour that
[2:06:47] it's supposed to be revealed in now
[2:06:48] somebody said with Andrew why are you
[2:06:50] taking time Amen to lay into these areas
[2:06:52] because I think we need to remember what
[2:06:54] we believe
[2:06:56] I think we believe a message and we
[2:06:58] ought to preach it come on come on
[2:07:01] Church y'all know me I'll shout right
[2:07:03] with you amen but when this child is
[2:07:05] done and the dancing's finished there's
[2:07:07] some devils to whip and there's going to
[2:07:09] be times you don't feel like shouting
[2:07:10] them Devils down you don't feel like
[2:07:12] dancing them Devils down but if this
[2:07:15] Revelation has taken the preeminence
[2:07:17] into your body there will be a strength
[2:07:20] it'll rise up on the inside of you and
[2:07:22] you'll denounce that devil on Monday
[2:07:24] you'll denounce that devil on Tuesday
[2:07:26] I'm telling your friends the source of
[2:07:28] the power to overcome 200 000 000 Devils
[2:07:32] is coming from the message of the hour
[2:07:35] the Revelation which when that
[2:07:37] Revelation comes can I have them okay
[2:07:39] when that Revelation comes Brother David
[2:07:42] it's going to unite it's going to bring
[2:07:44] the head down to the body in other words
[2:07:47] the body and the head is now one unit
[2:07:53] I feel like shouting on that one the
[2:07:56] head and the body is one unit they're no
[2:07:59] longer separate they become one see who
[2:08:02] is the beginning the firstborn from the
[2:08:04] dead that in all things he might have
[2:08:06] the preeminence look at this word
[2:08:08] preeminence amen it is to hold the first
[2:08:11] place it is surpassing all others when
[2:08:14] this Revelation comes into the body it
[2:08:18] will take the preeminence it will take
[2:08:21] the first place oh god promise it like
[2:08:24] this he said now just be as patient as
[2:08:26] you can I'm gonna can I read this to you
[2:08:27] Christ the mystery paragraph 97 be as
[2:08:30] patient as you can for I feel that in
[2:08:32] here if God will help me we'll reveal
[2:08:34] and bring in your mind all these things
[2:08:36] that I've talked on all through the days
[2:08:37] of the Tabernacle well I've said what
[2:08:39] I've said well I have done what I've
[2:08:41] done this is why when a prophet says
[2:08:43] that he turns rather than the Colossians
[2:08:46] 1 and reads verse 15 to verse 29 and
[2:08:49] then he says God has a three-fold
[2:08:51] purpose in this great mystery secret he
[2:08:54] said now I Believe by the help of God
[2:08:56] who is present he will show it to us so
[2:09:00] William Branham was not presuming he was
[2:09:03] not standing there by himself pulling
[2:09:05] from the atmosphere to say something but
[2:09:07] for God who wrote the Bible was not
[2:09:10] standing but free foot from him and
[2:09:12] while he was speaking those seals while
[2:09:14] he was preaching the Feast of trumpets
[2:09:16] while he was preaching future home he
[2:09:18] was not receiving it from a school he
[2:09:20] was receiving it from the headquarters
[2:09:22] of the Bride which is heaven
[2:09:25] he said the first fold is God is going
[2:09:27] to reveal himself to the people then the
[2:09:30] second fold is he's going to have the
[2:09:32] preeminence in his body of Believers
[2:09:34] that is his bride that he might live in
[2:09:37] his people the third thing he's going to
[2:09:39] do is he's going to restore the kingdom
[2:09:41] to its rightly position that failed by
[2:09:44] sin by the first Adam amen back to her
[2:09:47] he walked in the cool evening with the
[2:09:48] people talked with him and fellowshipped
[2:09:51] with him listen to me Church Revelation
[2:09:53] 10 1 there was another I know I'm
[2:09:55] preaching fast but stay with me if you
[2:09:57] can and then there was another Mighty
[2:09:59] Angel there was a mighty Angel come down
[2:10:01] from heaven and he was clothed in a
[2:10:03] cloud why did he come down to have his
[2:10:05] picture taken along no to give you a
[2:10:08] cover on Life Magazine no to give
[2:10:10] science something to argue about no the
[2:10:12] prophet said Life Magazine packed the
[2:10:15] circle of a cloud and a lot there that
[2:10:17] they could not understand and don't know
[2:10:19] it yet he said months before it happened
[2:10:22] it was told here that he's going to
[2:10:24] bring the body Believers together when
[2:10:27] that cloud appeared it was the headship
[2:10:30] oh God it was the headship coming down
[2:10:33] to the Earth to bring the body together
[2:10:36] to reveal to them and to take up the
[2:10:39] Lost ends in other words he was not
[2:10:42] Gathering us to fight he was not
[2:10:44] Gathering us to fuss he was not getting
[2:10:46] us to have to have this dog well I might
[2:10:49] as well preach this Revelation come
[2:10:52] together the bride to unify the bride to
[2:10:55] where we would all be saying the same
[2:10:57] thing
[2:10:58] [Applause]
[2:11:00] now I know I feel that devil pushing at
[2:11:02] me right now and I will push back amen
[2:11:04] you ain't got no thought coming you
[2:11:06] ain't got no little private
[2:11:08] interpretation that brother Brandon told
[2:11:10] brother so and so 50 years ago on a log
[2:11:12] somewhere I'm not under obligation to
[2:11:15] preach you're private well I might as
[2:11:17] well take a sort of that's why we can't
[2:11:19] even fail a ship no more it's cause we
[2:11:21] built so many finches and we can't get
[2:11:23] together and enjoy the Holy Ghost that's
[2:11:25] why when we get a meeting together a
[2:11:27] bunch of ideas come in the building and
[2:11:28] the preacher can't even hardly preach
[2:11:30] cause a bunch of old Devils sitting in
[2:11:32] there trying to take over the atmosphere
[2:11:33] but you know what I think it's time to
[2:11:35] do I think it's time to take a holy
[2:11:37] ghost bomb and blow them Devils out of
[2:11:39] the church and bring the unity of the
[2:11:42] message of the hour back in the people
[2:11:45] come on church I know there's a hundred
[2:11:48] Baptist ideas but there's only one
[2:11:50] message
[2:11:52] oh there's 30 Pentecostal ideas but
[2:11:54] there's only one message I know there's
[2:11:56] 900 denominations but there's only one
[2:11:59] message if we are message Believers
[2:12:01] let's humble ourselves and say what a
[2:12:04] prophet said and bring a unity in the
[2:12:06] church
[2:12:10] we have been babies long enough
[2:12:13] standing we have been in mature babies
[2:12:16] long enough well I belong to this amen
[2:12:18] forget all about it we're a body of
[2:12:21] Believers it's time to unite ourselves
[2:12:25] and I know what I'm talking about amen
[2:12:28] it ain't the people caring the egos that
[2:12:30] suffer it's the people

[2:13:16] Christ let's worship him let's exalt him
[2:13:19] let's remember him let's glorify here
[2:13:23] he's the one that deserves all the
[2:13:26] priests
[2:13:27] it ain't about who preached what who
[2:13:30] went where it's about a message taking
[2:13:32] the preeminence in a body
[2:13:35] [Applause]
[2:13:39] it's a dangerous spot devil you better

[2:13:53] I know what I'm talking about I'm a
[2:13:56] little disagreement come up and we got
[2:13:58] Elders acting like babies

[2:14:06] hurt your feelings you raise your hands
[2:14:08] and you bless God and you glorify God
[2:14:11] and you give him the praise and you kiss
[2:14:14] his feet and you hug his neck because it
[2:14:17] ain't about a man it's about Jesus
[2:14:21] it's about Jesus
[2:14:23] it's about him it ain't about me it
[2:14:26] ain't about you it's about a body of
[2:14:28] believers
[2:14:31] bury it and let's go forward
[2:14:38] let the past be the past

[2:14:50] Miranda you better be careful I will not
[2:14:52] be careful that spirit
[2:14:54] it's a spirit of division
[2:14:56] it's a spirit to divide it's a spirit to
[2:14:59] conquer and it comes from hell
[2:15:02] and the pulpit ain't the place to fight
[2:15:04] with somebody you don't like
[2:15:06] it's the place to preach the word and if
[2:15:09] you ain't gonna preach the word sit down
[2:15:10] and let somebody else that will preach
[2:15:12] sort cause we've got young people that
[2:15:15] need the Holy Ghost we got marriages
[2:15:17] that need to be restored
[2:15:20] everybody
[2:15:21] we got Sinners that need to be saved

[2:15:56] the dust settles and the Smoke Clears
[2:15:58] we're still going to be praising God
[2:16:00] we're still going to be worshiping God
[2:16:02] we're still going to be saying
[2:16:03] hallelujah we're still going to be
[2:16:05] giving our all
[2:16:06] because it's about him
[2:16:10] somebody give him some praise Oh Praise

[2:16:36] Egos and let's become a body
[2:16:38] [Applause]
[2:16:43] it's out let's go forward
[2:16:46] now now
[2:16:48] I think that devil got out of here
[2:16:51] playing a bunch of babies
[2:16:59] there's a lot of things there's a lot of
[2:17:01] things
[2:17:02] listen there's a lot of things we have
[2:17:04] to give account for and I'll tell you
[2:17:05] this much right now I pray to God I
[2:17:07] never stand before God as a baby who
[2:17:10] hindered an atmosphere in a meeting
[2:17:12] [Applause]
[2:17:14] I pray to God I never stand before God
[2:17:16] as some immature amen preacher that I
[2:17:19] thought I was something and I come in a
[2:17:20] service on a Wednesday and somebody
[2:17:22] needed a miracle and because of my
[2:17:24] little feelings and my little comfort
[2:17:26] zone I set the anointing I say oh God
[2:17:28] take me off the scene before that
[2:17:30] happens this is about your people this
[2:17:33] is about two people it ain't about my
[2:17:35] Ministry it ain't about our ministry
[2:17:37] it's about the body
[2:17:39] thank you
[2:17:42] don't remember what it was like when we
[2:17:44] didn't come to church and worry about
[2:17:46] anything we just come together and
[2:17:48] praise God I remember brother Joe I
[2:17:50] remember when the Holy Ghost fell and we
[2:17:52] danced the building down you know why
[2:17:54] because we weren't all wadded up and
[2:17:56] tied up we were free well you know what
[2:17:59] I think it's time to do I think it's
[2:18:01] time to get free again
[2:18:03] I said I think listen they already
[2:18:06] called me crazy so I'm going to give
[2:18:08] them something to work with I think it's
[2:18:10] time to get free again I think it's time
[2:18:13] to quit arguing about what songs we're
[2:18:15] seeing and what meetings we go to and
[2:18:17] who we shake hands with I think it's
[2:18:19] time to come back to the landmark of the
[2:18:22] church which is the message of the hour
[2:18:24] and that Christ
[2:18:26] Let Jesus Christ
[2:18:29] [Applause]
[2:18:33] let him take the preeminence of Our
[2:18:34] Lives
[2:18:38] well who you after the devil
[2:18:41] who you fighting the devil
[2:18:44] it's time to have church
[2:18:50] they already talk about me so they might
[2:18:52] as well keep on
[2:18:54] it's time to have church I said it's
[2:18:57] time to have church it it's time to have
[2:19:00] some good old-fashioned Acts 2 38 holy
[2:19:03] ghost power purifier anointed Services
[2:19:06] where the liberty of Jesus Christ were
[2:19:09] the whatever happened to the glory of
[2:19:11] God coming in the building and feeling
[2:19:13] the sanctuary to where the minister
[2:19:15] couldn't even preach
[2:19:17] it's time to clean the house
[2:19:20] I said it's time to clean the house it's
[2:19:23] time to clean the house it's time to
[2:19:25] make room for the glory of come again
[2:19:28] Brother David we need the glory we can
[2:19:32] do without the pews but we need the
[2:19:33] glory we can do without a wood pulpin
[2:19:36] but we gotta have the glory the glory is
[2:19:39] the only thing brother Joel that'll
[2:19:41] change the situation
[2:19:45] is the glory
[2:19:48] ears the glory
[2:19:50] is
[2:19:52] the glory
[2:19:53] what are you saying preacher I'm saying
[2:19:56] the glory is here
[2:19:57] it's time to step into it
[2:20:00] now I know what I'm talking about
[2:20:03] I know what I'm talking about
[2:20:04] here
[2:20:05] I'm talking about what happened to Unity
[2:20:09] of the message
[2:20:12] Unity of the message have you forgot
[2:20:15] what the church age book said the spirit
[2:20:17] the prophet and the bride will all be
[2:20:20] saying the same thing
[2:20:22] [Applause]
[2:20:24] you know what I'm talking about
[2:20:26] it's because ideas have taken
[2:20:28] preeminence and not for revelation
[2:20:30] preachers ideas has taken the
[2:20:33] preeminence and not the Revelation
[2:20:35] that's why you got so
[2:20:37] [Applause]
[2:20:38] well we might as well preach that's why
[2:20:41] you got doctrines about open-toed shoes
[2:20:44] come on that's why you got doctrines
[2:20:46] about all kinds of things hair dye come
[2:20:49] on say what a prophet said
[2:20:52] wouldn't that help a lot just say what
[2:20:54] he said just read question answers and
[2:20:57] say what he said
[2:21:00] we don't need your legalism we need the
[2:21:02] revelation
[2:21:04] we don't need the way you did it in
[2:21:06] Pentecost we need the Revelation so
[2:21:09] let's see what a prophet said
[2:21:12] thank you
[2:21:13] now preacher are you taking away our
[2:21:15] personal convictions by no means but the
[2:21:18] only thing that belongs in the Pulpit is
[2:21:19] the word not my personal convictions
[2:21:24] I've got a lot of personal convictions
[2:21:26] but I'm not preaching him tonight you
[2:21:28] know why because my personal convictions
[2:21:30] is not the headship of the body the
[2:21:33] headship of the body is the word and the
[2:21:36] word is in heaven so if I'm going to
[2:21:38] hold a microphone I'm gonna say what
[2:21:41] heaven backs up I'm going to say with
[2:21:43] the angels will come into the building
[2:21:45] and Trouble the waters when the Rarities
[2:21:48] preached in the church
[2:21:52] it's a new day
[2:21:54] I said it's a new day you know what I
[2:21:56] say it I said it's time to take the land
[2:22:00] I'm gonna forget this and just preach
[2:22:01] it's time to take the land we've stood
[2:22:04] on the border long enough it's time to
[2:22:07] go over
[2:22:08] it's time to go over it's time to go
[2:22:11] over into where all the promises lay
[2:22:17] we can fight on the border but we can't
[2:22:19] fight in the promises
[2:22:23] know what devil pushing back against me
[2:22:26] but I ain't scared
[2:22:28] time to bring the word back in the
[2:22:30] church
[2:22:32] it's time to bring Liberty back in the
[2:22:33] church
[2:22:35] if you preach this message and do away
[2:22:37] with the measuring rod
[2:22:39] [Music]
[2:22:42] somebody said man today so well ain't
[2:22:44] nobody hardly preaching on standards no
[2:22:45] more I said well where are you are they
[2:22:46] might not be but there are some still
[2:22:48] doing it
[2:22:50] oh I know I know that that was all
[2:22:52] watered up right now but I'm gonna drive
[2:22:53] him back to hell where he comes from
[2:22:56] the Revelation has taken the preeminence
[2:22:59] in the body then the way a prophet said
[2:23:01] we'd rest is the way we dress
[2:23:04] [Music]
[2:23:05] somebody shout out to owe me my amen or
[2:23:09] something let's go forward
[2:23:11] what about it Church let's go forward
[2:23:14] Andrew I'm older you knocking at me by
[2:23:17] no means am I Knocking At You Caleb was
[2:23:19] an 80 year old man and he was still a
[2:23:22] part of a new generation do you know
[2:23:24] what do you know what separated Caleb
[2:23:27] from the old Fighters was he followed
[2:23:30] the preeminent revelation of Moses
[2:23:33] that's what separated Caleb from all the
[2:23:36] old Fighters was he forgot what they
[2:23:38] were fighting about and he remembered
[2:23:40] what God promised him
[2:23:42] over the island I would that God denied
[2:23:44] we would remember what God promised us
[2:23:47] you know what he promised us he promised
[2:23:49] us healing he promised us healing he
[2:23:51] promised us a miracle he promised us a
[2:23:54] Rapture he promised us a body change he
[2:23:57] promised us the future home he promised
[2:23:59] us a new theophany he promised us a new
[2:24:02] heavens and a new Earth let's forget the
[2:24:05] fact and remember the promise
[2:24:07] [Applause]
[2:24:07] [Music]
[2:24:09] [Applause]
[2:24:13] you better be careful no it's time to
[2:24:15] bring the message back
[2:24:18] it's time to say what a prophet said
[2:24:20] it'll send a lot of stuff just say it
[2:24:25] just say it
[2:24:26] it's not that hard
[2:24:34] I remember
[2:24:35] I remember
[2:24:36] oh you can't say this and you can't say
[2:24:39] that and I remember when them devils and
[2:24:40] scarecrows kept me out of the promises
[2:24:43] but when I saw my name
[2:24:48] when I heard my name your scarecrow's
[2:24:52] lost all influence the scarecrow's no
[2:24:54] longer scared me when I could see a
[2:24:57] prophet said it
[2:24:58] I was looking for a Pulpit to repeat it
[2:25:01] because I think what a prophet said
[2:25:04] ought to have the preeminent again
[2:25:05] [Applause]
[2:25:10] it's the Holy Spirit now I got I gotta
[2:25:12] get this together and close I'm way off
[2:25:14] my notes it's the Holy Spirit coming
[2:25:17] down to Quicken or to make alive those
[2:25:20] people that's for ordained of God to be
[2:25:23] in the rapture that's it if he is a true
[2:25:26] Eagle he will understand the message of
[2:25:29] the hour
[2:25:31] if he's a true Eagle it's the Holy
[2:25:33] Spirit today hunting out honest hearts
[2:25:36] that will believe that message and every
[2:25:39] promise that's made is yours in your
[2:25:42] possession and the Holy Spirit is here
[2:25:44] to Quicken that to you what kind of
[2:25:47] people should we be how wonderful to see
[2:25:49] God's Great Holy Spirit here to do that
[2:25:51] when the Holy Ghost itself is here to
[2:25:53] Bear a record of this hour Jesus said
[2:25:56] it's the same yesterday today and
[2:25:57] forever listen how dare any man wipe
[2:26:00] that out of there
[2:26:01] [Applause]
[2:26:04] you don't want to know what calls to
[2:26:06] fight is when a man tries to wipe your
[2:26:07] inheritance out
[2:26:09] [Applause]
[2:26:11] a cause to fat is when a man tells you
[2:26:14] you can't have it is when a man says
[2:26:16] it's not for you
[2:26:19] I'm preaching to you is when a man says
[2:26:22] it ain't yours listen if it's got my
[2:26:24] name on it
[2:26:26] [Applause]
[2:26:28] you know what if you now
[2:26:31] and never get a revelation of your name
[2:26:33] then they're always going to threaten
[2:26:34] you and move you around but if you know
[2:26:37] who you are
[2:26:41] if you know who you are their threats
[2:26:44] don't bother you if you know who you are
[2:26:46] the devil's Scare Tactics don't bother
[2:26:49] you if you know who you are you know
[2:26:52] it's got your name on it
[2:26:55] oh yeah this is heavy but I'm gonna move
[2:26:58] it
[2:26:59] I remember one time I remember one time
[2:27:01] we went to a went to a here a southern
[2:27:03] gospel group and it was a place there
[2:27:06] and there was chairs you can send him a
[2:27:09] Chad have a ticket
[2:27:10] well the problem was we didn't get
[2:27:12] tickets well you know just little church
[2:27:14] little group there come in there's some
[2:27:16] good good gospel singing so we didn't
[2:27:17] get tickets well they had some open
[2:27:19] chairs in there so when we got there I
[2:27:20] said hey we ain't got no tickets but
[2:27:22] then there's open chairs in there can we
[2:27:24] can we sit down
[2:27:25] he said well yeah you can go in there
[2:27:27] and you can sit down he said but the
[2:27:29] problem is that seat's got a number on
[2:27:31] it and somebody's got a ticket to it
[2:27:35] because every seat in the house is sold
[2:27:38] he said so you can go in there and say
[2:27:40] it but if somebody shows up
[2:27:43] and they've got the ticket with that
[2:27:46] seat number on it you got to get up
[2:27:50] you gotta move so you know what I did it
[2:27:53] asked me one song they sang I don't
[2:27:55] remember
[2:27:57] you know why because the whole time I
[2:27:59] sat there I was scared to death
[2:28:02] I was looking over my shoulder I didn't
[2:28:04] know when somebody was going to show up
[2:28:06] and say that's my seat get out of it you
[2:28:09] can't have it
[2:28:11] so when I went back for next year to
[2:28:13] hear them I made sure I had a ticket and
[2:28:16] you know what I did I enjoyed the
[2:28:18] singing you know what I didn't do I
[2:28:20] didn't look over my shoulder I didn't
[2:28:22] look around me I wasn't worried somebody
[2:28:24] was going to misplace me because I had a
[2:28:27] ticket in other words brother I had a
[2:28:29] right to be in the seat in search of the
[2:28:32] Living God you have got a token and it's
[2:28:35] called the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[2:28:38] if anybody's got a right you got a right
[2:28:40] if anybody got a right to dance this
[2:28:43] ride got a right to dance if anybody got
[2:28:46] a right to preach these message
[2:28:48] preachers have got a right to preach
[2:28:50] ain't no devil gonna put me out cause I
[2:28:53] got a ticket I'm sealed until the day of
[2:28:56] my Redemption
[2:28:58] what do you saying preacher I'm saying
[2:29:00] in closing the Revelation has taken
[2:29:02] preeminence
[2:29:03] you can Huff you can puff but you'll
[2:29:06] never blow me out of position because
[2:29:08] doc put me here
[2:29:12] brother Force when you got a token when
[2:29:16] you got a ticket they can talk about you
[2:29:18] they can ridicule you but when you got a
[2:29:20] seat you can say you can't move me cause
[2:29:23] I got a token
[2:29:26] and for years people has been backing
[2:29:29] off the promises of God but it's a new
[2:29:31] generation who's got a token and they
[2:29:34] say devil you ain't backing me out
[2:29:39] if I want to raise my hands I'm going to
[2:29:42] raise my hand if I want to stomp my feet
[2:29:45] I'm going to stomp my feet if I want to
[2:29:48] stand up and dance a little bit I'm
[2:29:50] going to dance a little bit because I
[2:29:52] have got rights in this revelation
[2:29:56] my mama didn't put me here my daddy
[2:29:58] didn't put me here my seed put me here
[2:30:03] my seed put me here from before the
[2:30:06] foundation of the world
[2:30:09] [Applause]
[2:30:20] I'm skipping over a bunch to say this
[2:30:23] it'll have effect in every member
[2:30:27] there's one body
[2:30:29] but there's many members
[2:30:31] [Music]
[2:30:32] there's one body
[2:30:34] but there's many members and some of
[2:30:37] y'all's a part of this body and you've
[2:30:39] been in your position for 50 years
[2:30:42] and you know what we say God bless you
[2:30:47] don't we
[2:30:49] don't we thank you

[2:31:30] who has headship in heaven who you can't
[2:31:33] leave without
[2:31:36] who you can't leave humble that's why we
[2:31:38] need to quit worrying about what

[2:31:45] the last name in come on Church there's

[2:32:21] how can I get personal here brother Ben
[2:32:22] I remember a few years ago preaching
[2:32:25] right here in this church on a Wednesday
[2:32:27] night what hardly nobody here we was
[2:32:29] just in here having a Wednesday night me
[2:32:31] brother Dale I was getting ready to come

[2:32:37] Pulpit preaching and I could feel the
[2:32:39] pressure I could feel the spirits I
[2:32:41] could feel the enemy I could feel the
[2:32:42] burn to the people and that devil was
[2:32:44] pushing against me brother Ben just to
[2:32:46] quit and close and just close up but you
[2:32:49] know what I do it I knew my position and
[2:32:52] I knew this message worked Wesley I knew
[2:32:54] if I would preach it God would back it
[2:32:56] up I didn't know when but I knew I was
[2:32:59] called to preach it
[2:33:00] and let me just stop here and say this
[2:33:02] amen if a man will preach the message he
[2:33:05] won't have to worry about a response

[2:46:02] member even our Lord Jesus Christ watch
[2:46:03] a prophet cross the mystery he said and
[2:46:05] to be sure that the whole Rapture now
[2:46:08] Luther was a part Wesley was a part the
[2:46:10] prophet was apart but just in the
[2:46:12] Revelation that they was making up the
[2:46:14] body the feet the toes the arms so forth
[2:46:17] until the head he said see that makes
[2:46:19] the entire Rapture it's the body of the
[2:46:23] word which is Christ

[2:47:35] things that he did making the word
[2:47:38] manifest oh if the church only knew its
[2:47:40] position it will one day

[2:48:05] [Music]
[2:48:08] where it's not my Ministry or your
[2:48:10] ministry
[2:48:11] it's church or this idea having the
[2:48:14] headship of the body
[2:48:15] but with a word

[2:50:46] sword of that Devil's Head
[2:50:48] and preach a message it'll bring Liberty
[2:50:52] and I believe I'm looking at people
