[5:40] welcome to our Bible study this evening
[5:42] we're coming to you from the church
[5:44] tonight we had some trouble with the
[5:46] internet last week at our house so we're
[5:48] trying to try to do this live if we can
[5:51] and then as many of yous can watch and
[5:52] we are doing an hour earlier so if you
[5:54] miss it it's no problem you can go back
[5:56] to it and get it later we won't be very
[5:58] long tonight but we're just trying to do
[6:01] some things a little bit differently and
[6:03] learn some new things I've got Peter and
[6:05] Esther on the video today and they'll
[6:08] also be bringing in the screen hopefully
[6:11] where you can see it on the video so
[6:14] we're figuring out how to do some stuff
[6:15] so just bear with us and and I'm
[6:18] thankful for you being able to join us
[6:20] tonight let's have a word of Prayer as
[6:21] we begin and we'll get started on this
[6:24] Heavenly Father Lord Jesus were so
[6:26] thankful to be in your presence here
[6:28] today and to know God that you're with
[6:31] us wherever we are father I pray that
[6:34] you would just move especially as we've
[6:36] heard the prayer requests today for
[6:38] brother Joel Forney I pray that you'd
[6:40] move where he's at today God and I
[6:42] haven't heard the results yet of the
[6:44] surgery if they're still in surgery but
[6:45] Lord we know that you're able to guide
[6:47] the doctors hand you're also able to
[6:49] touch our brother who's had faith for so
[6:52] many of us down through the years and so
[6:54] Lord were we're believing in agreeing
[6:56] father that these things will we'll be
[6:58] exactly what they should be god I pray
[7:01] that you'd help us tonight and as we're
[7:03] doing these things that there would be
[7:04] an ability that only you could give
[7:07] father I pray that you'd help us to to
[7:10] make take heed of the Word of God it's
[7:13] not important what I say but what the
[7:14] word says is important so I pray that
[7:16] you bless us tonight for every prayer
[7:18] request Lord that we've been we've been
[7:20] following as a church Lord and praying
[7:22] for that I pray that you just continue
[7:24] to meet those needs and I pray God that
[7:26] you would bless us Lord as we look
[7:29] forward in this coronavirus thing God
[7:31] you you knew this was coming we didn't
[7:33] know but I pray God that you'd help us
[7:35] to have the wisdom to know and what to
[7:37] do and as we go forward as we're nearing
[7:39] maybe perhaps the end of this and so we
[7:42] pray God that you'll help us help us as
[7:44] a church that we'd reach out during this
[7:46] time father whatever time that we have
[7:48] left here on the earth I pray father we
[7:50] would reach out and then we would help
[7:51] our community and those that are
[7:53] need all around us we know that we're
[7:55] much in need of prayer Lord and we want
[7:58] to not so much others praying for us but
[8:01] we're in need Lord that we would pray
[8:02] and that we would reach out to you and
[8:04] not that our situations would change God
[8:07] but that we would change
[8:08] I pray you granted tonight we pray in
[8:10] Jesus name Amen alright we're gonna read
[8:15] again from 1st Corinthians chapter 1 I
[8:17] want to read it as we go along tonight
[8:19] and just kind of save time but I do want
[8:22] to back up a little bit and go over a
[8:24] little bit of what we talked about the
[8:25] first time so that if you didn't get to
[8:27] listen to that you kind of get a chance
[8:29] to catch up with us we found in verses 1
[8:34] through 9 that Paul in verse one defends
[8:36] his Apostleship in other words he's
[8:38] defending his right to say the things
[8:41] that he said and so he's defending that
[8:44] and his ability to to be the one to say
[8:49] it and we found out that we have a right
[8:52] to say certain things and we have to be
[8:54] able to defend that Paul in verse 1 also
[8:58] identifies himself as one of the
[8:59] ministry he he talks about being one
[9:02] with Sosthenes our brother and and so he
[9:06] identifies himself and Paul always did
[9:08] that and his greetings to the churches
[9:09] we found out that the Corinthians were
[9:12] Saints the Corinthians were not
[9:15] unbelievers they were not people who
[9:18] were lost but they were saved but yet at
[9:22] the same time they needed to toe the
[9:24] line they needed to get back in line as
[9:26] brother Branham tells us with the
[9:28] preview of the bride they needed to get
[9:30] back in line that fallen far from where
[9:32] they should be or had never come to what
[9:34] they should be they had been immature
[9:36] and carnal and but they were Saints they
[9:39] were Saints it didn't change who they
[9:41] were so he wrote to them as such we
[9:44] found out in verse 7 that they thought
[9:45] of themselves as a first-class church
[9:47] and thought of themselves is the best
[9:49] and I'll get to that in just a moment
[9:51] and then in verses 8 through 9 we found
[9:54] that God was faithful to them and I'm so
[9:56] grateful tonight for the faithfulness of
[9:59] God that God was faithful to confirm
[10:02] them through correction and through
[10:04] their ability to learn
[10:06] as they as they worked through these
[10:08] things and I believe God will be
[10:09] faithful with us as well to correct us
[10:13] and to bring us to where we need to be
[10:15] because every one of us need something
[10:18] from God we need God to move on our
[10:21] behalf we need we need God to correct us
[10:25] in a way that would be helpful and so
[10:28] that's what the book of Corinthians is
[10:30] about is correction that would be
[10:32] helpful and that would be that would be
[10:36] something that would not destroy us but
[10:40] something that would help us along
[10:42] life's journey so we want to make sure
[10:44] that we're able to do that tonight now I
[10:49] wanted to read this to you I wanted to
[10:51] read this last week and I never did get
[10:53] to it but Charles Spurgeon and I have a
[10:55] Spurgeon Study Bible here so I don't
[10:56] have it on the screen but Charles
[10:59] Spurgeon on the first corinthians said
[11:00] this he said the most gifted church is
[11:03] not always in the healthiest condition a
[11:06] church may have many rich influential or
[11:09] learned members yet that church may be
[11:12] in an unhealthy condition such was the
[11:15] case with the church at Corinth Paul in
[11:17] the opening of his letter told them that
[11:19] he think God always on their behalf for
[11:21] the grace of God given to them by Christ
[11:22] Jesus then in everything they were
[11:25] enriched in all speech and in all
[11:26] knowledge they did not lack in any
[11:29] spiritual gift they were waiting for the
[11:31] coming of the Lord Jesus Christ the
[11:33] Corinthians this is Spurgeon again he
[11:35] says the Corinthians were what we would
[11:37] call a first-class church they had many
[11:40] who understood much of the learning of
[11:42] the Greeks they were people of classic
[11:44] taste people of good understanding
[11:46] people of profound knowledge and yet in
[11:49] spiritual health that church was one of
[11:51] the worst in all Greece and perhaps in
[11:53] the world among all the churches one
[11:55] could not find another church sunk so
[11:57] low as this one although it was the most
[11:59] gifted the opening of the letter Paul
[12:02] hinted that the purpose of the church
[12:03] was to confirm the testimony about
[12:06] Christ I want to get that because that's
[12:08] our purpose is to confirm the testimony
[12:10] of Christ with our lives it's not so
[12:13] much what we say how many gifts that we
[12:15] have but are we able to confirm with our
[12:17] lives the testimony of Christ
[12:19] if a church does not use its gifts and
[12:22] resources for that purpose it misses the
[12:24] entire point of its existence I thought
[12:27] that was good and that was the
[12:28] Corinthian church let's go to 1st
[12:32] Corinthians 1 in 10 first corinthians
[12:35] chapter 1 and verse 10 if you're
[12:37] following along in your Bible at home he
[12:40] says now I beseech you brethren by the
[12:43] name of our Lord Jesus Christ that you
[12:45] all speak the same thing and that there
[12:46] be no divisions among you but that you
[12:49] be perfectly joined together in the same
[12:52] mind and in the same judgment and you'll
[12:54] find Paul using medical terms here you'd
[12:57] be perfectly joined together one body
[12:59] but he speaks of that you speak the same
[13:03] thing that's one and that there be no
[13:05] divisions among you so two things that
[13:07] he's speaking of speak the same thing
[13:09] notice he doesn't say to believe the
[13:13] same thing necessarily although it would
[13:15] be important to believe the same thing
[13:16] he doesn't say to have the same opinions
[13:19] but he says speak the same thing because
[13:22] what you say is what's going to have an
[13:24] impact on the world that you live in and
[13:27] so he says speak the same thing brother
[13:29] Branham deals with this in an immense
[13:31] meeting with ministers and deacons and
[13:33] and people like that and he says our
[13:36] Heavenly Father he's praying he said we
[13:38] have assembled here as a group of man
[13:40] Christian men who love you who believe
[13:43] in you and who is dedicated our lives
[13:44] and services to your service
[13:47] there's ministers here young men
[13:49] middle-aged men they got churches
[13:51] they're responsible before God
[13:53] there's deacons here that's responsible
[13:56] in their offices in different churches
[13:58] there's trustees there's
[13:59] responsibilities pastors evangelists
[14:01] whatever Lord we're responsible to you
[14:04] and that's why we come together that we
[14:07] might all speak the same thing as we
[14:10] were said that we must do in the
[14:11] scripture we must all speak alike we
[14:16] must all speak the same thing now why do
[14:18] some not speak the same thing and the
[14:21] same thing is not my idea of something
[14:23] or someone else's but it's the Word of
[14:25] God well why do why is that not always
[14:27] what we speak and brother Branham
[14:29] explains that and God hiding himself in
[14:31] simplicity he said now he said why
[14:33] can't people believe the same the simple
[14:35] simplicity of a humble bunch of people
[14:37] see and the voice of the signs of God
[14:40] which we know the voice of the sign is
[14:41] the message of the hour why can't they
[14:44] believe it just like it always been a
[14:47] true Word of God being made manifest
[14:51] it's they're too smart and too educated
[14:54] to believe the simple form of the
[14:56] written word they want to put their own
[14:58] interpretation to it it don't mean this
[15:01] it don't mean that see it does mean that
[15:03] he said listen may I say this right
[15:06] quick now even the visions that God
[15:07] gives here at the place it's so
[15:09] misunderstood he said that's the reason
[15:14] you hear me on the tapes say say what
[15:16] the tapes say so what brother Brown is
[15:18] saying when he says say what the tapes
[15:19] say is the same thing Paul said he's
[15:21] saying that we should all speak the same
[15:23] thing we should say what the tapes say
[15:26] he doesn't want you changing the meaning
[15:28] of what he said and misrepresenting it
[15:30] to the people and so he says that's the
[15:32] reason you hear me on the tapes say say
[15:34] what the tapes say say what the visions
[15:35] say said now if you're wide awake you'll
[15:38] see something he said see I hope I don't
[15:40] have to hold it in my hand and show you
[15:41] see it's here we're at the end
[15:44] yes sir smart educational miss it he
[15:48] said the simple visions when they were
[15:49] revealed in such simplicity till it just
[15:52] covers over the top of the people's
[15:54] heads and so many times we don't say the
[15:57] same thing because we miss the
[15:58] simplicity of what he's actually trying
[16:01] to say and many times we missed the the
[16:04] forest for the trees we get too involved
[16:07] in words and and certain ideologies and
[16:11] certain things well I'm of this camper
[16:13] and the other and we'll talk about that
[16:14] in a moment but we need to find out what
[16:17] the word is and and remember that we are
[16:20] called to declare the entire Council of
[16:23] God so the second thing he said that
[16:26] there would be no divisions no divisions
[16:28] there's no schism since the words the
[16:30] same word for schisms in the body a
[16:32] schism is Wesley called that an
[16:35] alienation of affection from each other
[16:38] I like that definition he said that
[16:40] there be no alienation of affection from
[16:42] each other in other words you can
[16:45] disagree
[16:46] but when you speak that there would be
[16:49] no no difference in what you're saying
[16:54] now from one another or rather there
[16:59] would be no difference in your love when
[17:01] you get down to a certain point that
[17:03] you're speaking and and you disagree
[17:06] with one another but then you still love
[17:08] one another even though you disagree
[17:10] about things and and Wesley says this
[17:14] word ever taken any other sense in
[17:16] scripture but that you'd be joined in
[17:17] the same mind in the same affection same
[17:19] desires do you have the same love one
[17:21] for another but the random put it this
[17:24] way said many times people want to judge
[17:26] the man who doesn't agree with them said
[17:29] we're not to do that we can disagree
[17:32] with one another we can disagree with
[17:36] one another yet be friendly I like that
[17:39] we can disagree with one another yet be
[17:41] friendly said if I couldn't disagree
[17:44] with the man and still love him and pray
[17:47] for him and disagree him up I like the
[17:51] way he puts that disagree him up if I
[17:54] couldn't disagree with a man disagree
[17:56] him up with him on the basis of the
[17:58] scripture and for better enlightenment
[18:01] then I won't say nothing to him
[18:04] so if I can't agree with him if I can't
[18:06] disagree with him rather and still love
[18:08] him and still pray for him up and up on
[18:11] the basis of the scripture then I won't
[18:13] say nothing to him give them a chance to
[18:18] change that he said I always want to
[18:21] disagree with him friendly
[18:23] now that would teach us something
[18:24] wouldn't it and that's what Paul is
[18:26] saying here not that there would be no
[18:28] alienation of affection no schism in the
[18:30] body you may disagree you may have a
[18:32] difference of opinion but we all speak
[18:35] the same thing we all have the same word
[18:36] of God he said I want to disagree with
[18:40] him friendly because I love him and I
[18:42] certainly don't want him to be lost and
[18:45] he should do the same thing with me we
[18:47] don't want to be lost and we must base
[18:49] our thoughts notice what he says we must
[18:52] base our thoughts upon what the word
[18:54] says and so he's telling us that we
[18:58] can't just have a
[18:59] we can't just do this with anybody but
[19:01] if it's a brother he's going to come
[19:03] with the Word of God and we may have a
[19:05] disagreement about the Word of God but
[19:08] we have the same book we're coming back
[19:09] to we have the same the same thing the
[19:14] same token the same the word that I'm
[19:17] looking for the same absolute as the
[19:19] word that I'm looking for that we have
[19:21] the same absolute and because of we have
[19:23] the same absent which is a revealed word
[19:25] of the hour we know that we can come
[19:27] back to that even though we disagree
[19:29] about certain points so he says we must
[19:32] base our thoughts upon what the word
[19:33] says let the word be true not our Creed
[19:36] or what our thoughts but what he says no
[19:40] private interpretation but just what the
[19:42] word said
[19:46] first Corinthians 1:11 if you're
[19:49] following along in your in your Bibles
[19:50] tonight 1st Corinthians 1:11 so we
[19:52] started with verse 10 tonight we went
[19:54] through 1 through 9
[19:55] last time he says Fred have been
[19:58] declared unto me of you my brethren by
[20:03] them which are the house of Chloe that
[20:05] there are contentions among you there
[20:08] are contentions among you
[20:10] I like how Paul gets his knowledge and
[20:14] that's something that a minister has to
[20:15] do sometimes sometimes you just have to
[20:17] deal with what you know it can be a
[20:19] dangerous thing to do but Paul doesn't
[20:21] in the spirit of love contentions is
[20:23] quarrel or the definition definition is
[20:27] a quarrel wrangling yester if you've got
[20:31] that definition up there a quarrel
[20:33] wrangling contention debate strife or
[20:37] variance and I want to take that to
[20:40] Galatians chapter 5 if we could take
[20:43] that over to Galatians chapter 5 and
[20:45] I'll give you a minute to turn there
[20:46] Galatians chapter 5 verses 19 through 20
[20:48] and keep in first Corinthians because
[20:50] we're going to go four through several
[20:52] more verses but Galatians 5:19 is when
[20:55] it's talking about the works of the
[20:56] flesh and it talks about one of the
[21:00] works of the flesh are manifest which
[21:01] are these adultery fornication
[21:03] uncleanness lasciviousness verse 20
[21:07] idolatry witchcraft hatred variance
[21:12] variance is the same word as contention
[21:16] variance contentions emulations wrath
[21:18] strife seditions and heresies Underland
[21:23] heresies as well because I want to point
[21:26] out tonight the difference in a heresy
[21:28] and a variance or a contention because
[21:31] there is a difference let's go to Titus
[21:34] chapter 3 tie this chapter 3 in verse 10
[21:36] and it kind of explained to you about a
[21:39] heretic a heresy a heresy is something
[21:42] someone who's completely left the body
[21:44] of truth completely left the body of
[21:46] truth they we've seen lately people who
[21:49] deny the message completely and say
[21:51] brother Browne was a false prophet or
[21:53] something like that it would be a
[21:54] heretic by the scriptural definition
[21:56] someone who's left the body of truth
[21:58] they may still say they're a Christian
[21:59] but they've left the revealed truth and
[22:02] and counted the things of God has
[22:04] nothing and and and there would be other
[22:06] ways that you could be a heretic but I
[22:08] won't go into that tonight but in Titus
[22:11] 3:10 it says a man that is a heretic
[22:12] after the first and second admonition
[22:14] reject so give him a chance but if he
[22:17] keeps continuing down that way he says
[22:19] to reject in other words you can't
[22:21] really have fellowship with him there's
[22:22] no fellowship on the basis of the word
[22:24] because there's no word there's no
[22:26] atonement that you agree on that you
[22:28] could fellowship around and so you just
[22:30] leave him alone knowing that he that as
[22:33] such is subverted and sinneth being
[22:36] condemned of himself there's no point in
[22:38] arguing with him about it it's just just
[22:39] move on and and so that's the difference
[22:42] now this is the difference in division
[22:44] or contention versus heresy the vision
[22:47] is a medical term that Paul uses and
[22:50] it's torn but still in the body so it's
[22:53] like it's still hanging on
[22:55] but it's torn if you see that is that up
[22:58] on the screen Esther that definition
[23:00] division versus Harris eats torn but
[23:03] still in the body I got my kids
[23:05] scrambling back here so hope I hope
[23:07] y'all can see this torn but still
[23:10] they're gonna know how to do everything
[23:11] before they get done and and so if you
[23:15] get that it's a medical term that maybe
[23:17] you're kind of gruesome but if your arm
[23:19] got chopped halfway off but it's still
[23:21] there it's still there and so you bind
[23:24] it up you put it back together
[23:26] it's not in a good place but you're
[23:28] putting it back together you're putting
[23:30] it back together and so heresy is
[23:33] different from that heresy is something
[23:35] that's completely divided from the body
[23:40] completely divided from the body it's
[23:42] something that just unable to be put
[23:47] back together it's unable to be to be
[23:51] brought back to the body and so that's
[23:53] what heresy is let's go to verse 12
[23:56] first Corinthians and 1 and 12
[24:01] first Corinthians 1:12 says now this I
[24:06] say that every one of you saith I am of
[24:07] Paul I have a policy and I have Cephas
[24:11] and I have Christ
[24:13] so he's identifying the entire church in
[24:16] a in a set of schisms or set of
[24:19] divisions that they're all in and all of
[24:23] them are actually creating discord and
[24:28] identifying themselves by different
[24:31] names so I want to deal with that now he
[24:36] says one says I'm of Paul another says
[24:39] I'm of Apollo's notice says I have
[24:41] Cephas notice says I have Christ so four
[24:44] divisions if you pull that side up four
[24:46] divisions Paul Paulus Cephas which is
[24:50] Peter the Aramaic name for Peter and
[24:52] Christ the first one was the party of
[24:55] Paul Paul had a party represented there
[24:58] who called themselves by the name of
[25:00] Paul and there were those who believed
[25:04] what Paul had presented they owed to him
[25:06] their own salvation which many times is
[25:08] what a person will hold to is what they
[25:10] come in under what they were saved under
[25:12] and they had experienced the gospel and
[25:15] they they could not believe that there
[25:17] was any other mode of presenting Christ
[25:18] to me in other the way Paul preached and
[25:20] that's wonderful but gradually they
[25:23] become more concerned about upholding
[25:25] Paul's authority than to help the cause
[25:27] of Christ they probably fell into the
[25:31] mistake it's on the next slide to which
[25:34] all partisans are liable and they become
[25:38] more Pauline than Paul
[25:40] and I like the way this commentator put
[25:41] this because this is what happens even
[25:44] today they become more Pauline than Paul
[25:47] himself in other words they they
[25:48] defended Paul we didn't need to be
[25:50] defended and they actually actually
[25:55] magnify these peculiarities and attach
[25:57] the importance to casual sayings private
[26:00] practices of his own which in themselves
[26:02] were indifferent perhaps the way that he
[26:04] carried his Bible or the way that he did
[26:06] something so there was some danger that
[26:08] they might become more Pauline than
[26:11] Christian might allow their indebtedness
[26:14] to Paul to obscure their debt to Christ
[26:16] well I pray that we would never do that
[26:18] and they might so pride themselves in
[26:21] the teacher as to neglect what he taught
[26:23] and so they could tell you everything
[26:25] about Paul but not anything about what
[26:26] Paul preached so that's the party of
[26:29] Paul the party of Apollo's was a group a
[26:33] nopales was a great gifted minister and
[26:35] this was a learned and eloquent
[26:38] Alexandrian that had come to corinth
[26:40] after paul left and what paul had
[26:42] planted he he so successfully watered
[26:45] that many seemed to owe everything to em
[26:46] and and so before he came maybe they
[26:50] didn't really understand what paul
[26:51] preached and then Apollo's came and and
[26:54] he fitted the gospel into their previous
[26:56] knowledge and showed them its relation
[26:58] to other faiths opened up to them it's
[27:00] ethical wealth and bearing on life and
[27:02] they had been unable to make full use of
[27:04] Paul's teaching he had sown the seed in
[27:06] their minds but they don't the truth of
[27:09] his statements and accepted them but
[27:12] they never really understood it until
[27:13] Paulus preached it people are like that
[27:16] today and that may be true that there
[27:20] could be a minister that would come
[27:21] along and break down these things in a
[27:22] way that you would understand it and and
[27:25] the teaching of a Paulist was not
[27:27] opposed to Paul's it was supplementary
[27:30] to it and Paul tells the Corinthians
[27:32] that he even asked Apollo's to visit
[27:35] them again so we find out that they
[27:37] weren't rivals to one another but
[27:39] Apollo's refused very possibly because
[27:42] he was aware that there was a party
[27:44] there that was called by his name he
[27:46] didn't want to be identified that so
[27:47] Paul and Apollo's preached the same
[27:49] thing and yet there was a division in
[27:51] the church because one followed Paul
[27:52] said I'm a
[27:53] Paul the other one said I'm of Apollo's
[27:55] third party was the party of Peter a
[27:58] third party Gloria in the name of Cephas
[28:00] or Peter the apostle of the circumcision
[28:03] these would have been those who leaned
[28:05] toward the Jewish law and maybe they
[28:08] followed Peters example and withdrawing
[28:10] from the Gentiles but Paul rebuked him
[28:12] for that but yet they believed that
[28:14] Peter had a better authority a better
[28:16] right to say the things that he would
[28:18] say then Paul did and so these were
[28:21] people who called themselves by Peters
[28:24] name and they even criticized and I'm
[28:28] going through this trying to save some
[28:29] time but they even criticized Paul for
[28:33] not marrying because they felt like he
[28:35] he was insecure while Peter was able to
[28:38] marry what about you and and so they
[28:41] were of Peter and then there was another
[28:42] party which is interesting to me because
[28:46] Paul does not speak of this party in in
[28:50] a positive way but he he puts them right
[28:52] with the other parties and this party
[28:56] says I'm of Christ I'm of Christ now
[29:00] when I whenever I've read this I don't
[29:01] know about you but whenever I've read it
[29:03] I've always kind of thought that I would
[29:05] like to be in the party of Christ if I
[29:07] want to be in the party I would say I'm
[29:09] of Christ you say you're a Methodist or
[29:11] a Baptist or a Presbyterian I'm of
[29:12] Christ but yet they were using this as a
[29:16] way to divide people and this is
[29:19] important for us because I think most of
[29:21] you that would listen to this you're not
[29:23] gonna say I'm of this one or that one
[29:24] you're gonna say I'm of Christ I'm a
[29:26] Christian I follow the teachings of
[29:28] Christ but yet it was a spiritually
[29:32] proud utterance they were using that to
[29:34] differentiate themselves from these
[29:36] others they had used the name of Christ
[29:40] in an a in the name of unity against the
[29:44] other factions but it merely added
[29:47] another party to those already existing
[29:50] and so you might find people like that
[29:51] today that they say well I don't follow
[29:53] any preacher I just follow Christ maybe
[29:55] I don't even go to church I follow
[29:57] Christ well that's fine you might be a
[29:59] fine Christian but you're right there in
[30:01] that division of the body of Christ you
[30:03] can't be a Christian outside of the body
[30:07] if you are outside of the body and
[30:10] you're a Christian you just cause harm
[30:12] to the body you need to come back
[30:14] together with the body of Christ
[30:16] somewhere you have to be a part of the
[30:19] body of Christ you have to work with
[30:21] those maybe just a few but there's got
[30:23] to be someone that you can work with so
[30:25] when you say I'm of Christ it's just
[30:27] just me in Christ just me and God I
[30:28] don't have to go to church I'm not to do
[30:30] these things you have to be careful with
[30:32] that even though you can see the error
[30:34] of the PAS lights and the and the Apollo
[30:37] sites and the Peter ice yet you have to
[30:40] be careful not to just name yourself
[30:43] something to separate from them but to
[30:46] just be a Christian so brother branham
[30:48] picks it up this way and I know I'm
[30:50] spending a long time on this verse we
[30:51] won't spend this long on every verse in
[30:53] first Corinthians but I just want to
[30:55] really bear down on this brother Branham
[30:58] says if you say Methodist that's just a
[31:00] blasphemous name you say Baptists that's
[31:03] a blasphemous name we can say amen to
[31:05] that
[31:05] but brother let me ask you something
[31:07] what about Pentecost if it's not a
[31:10] born-again experience it's still a
[31:12] blasphemous name patterned after the
[31:14] beginning he said that's right they
[31:16] don't know one another I want you to
[31:18] just really listen to this and so I'm
[31:20] trying hard not to preach this and just
[31:22] because I'm behind the pulpit but it's
[31:24] just the way we had to do it tonight but
[31:25] just to talk about it but he said they
[31:29] don't know one another and they don't
[31:31] know fellowship all they know is their
[31:34] Creed and so they automatically discount
[31:37] people in some other place under some
[31:40] other ministry they don't know those
[31:43] people
[31:43] they don't necessarily even know what's
[31:45] taught but they know their Creed and so
[31:48] they said we know we're not like them
[31:49] but we shouldn't do that whether it's a
[31:52] Baptist Methodist Pentecostals Catholic
[31:54] it doesn't matter what matters is do we
[31:56] know Christ that's what matters but the
[31:59] venom tells the story about the blood
[32:00] tag being on the on the cows ear that
[32:04] would it was the blood tag that got him
[32:06] into the pasture and that's what's gonna
[32:07] get us into heaven is whether or not
[32:08] we're covered by the blood but he said
[32:12] these people they don't know fellowship
[32:13] all they know is their Creed and we have
[32:15] to be careful that doesn't
[32:16] happened to us as well first Corinthians
[32:18] chapter 1 and verse 13 he said his
[32:22] Christ divided
[32:23] I love the way Paul puts this it's a
[32:26] rhetorical question that's Greek
[32:28] argument here he says Christ divided was
[32:30] Paul crucified for you were you baptized
[32:33] in the name Paul some may have been the
[32:39] paw lights might have gotten that far
[32:40] but they did for brother Branham and I'm
[32:42] just kind of paralleling brother
[32:44] branham's ministry here with Paul
[32:46] because he was also a messenger Paul
[32:48] being the first messenger but the brand
[32:49] being the last he says in an absolute he
[32:52] said I'm only telling you the truth
[32:53] friend don't let it pass you by I'm not
[32:54] claiming I'm nothing I'm your brother
[32:57] don't you pay any attention to a
[32:58] messenger you watch the message don't
[33:01] watch the messenger God will take it
[33:02] away from you he will share his glory
[33:04] with nobody that's right don't you watch
[33:06] the messenger watch the message first
[33:11] Corinthians 1:14 he says Paul says I
[33:15] think God that I baptized none of you
[33:17] but Crispus and Gaius listen any should
[33:21] say verse 15 that I had baptized in mine
[33:23] own name and as I said brother branham
[33:24] dealt with these things he said the
[33:26] other day in Canada a prophet or a
[33:28] brother rather showed me a little ticket
[33:30] of a thing he's packed in his pocket and
[33:32] said william branham is our lord
[33:34] baptizing in the name of william branham
[33:35] so I'm still do that today he said a
[33:38] precious he said if it had been an enemy
[33:39] if it had been my enemy I would have
[33:42] knew it was a joke but a precious
[33:44] darling brother came up to confess his
[33:46] sins and his wrongs and say his faith in
[33:49] me as being Jesus Christ he says I got
[33:52] all kinds of letters come in the last
[33:54] few days and calls from different places
[33:55] so saying I was Christ so who were these
[33:58] people these were the the Paul lights
[34:00] and the people that would follow after
[34:03] brother Branham after the flesh and they
[34:05] would say it's so saying that it was
[34:07] Christ he said brethren that is a
[34:08] horrible disgraceful ungodly lie of the
[34:11] devil
[34:12] I don't want to repeat one of the
[34:13] devil's lies I don't know about you he
[34:14] said they were precious people we have
[34:16] to remember that it was precious people
[34:18] that had been my enemy I could
[34:20] understand it but they had been deceived
[34:22] and he said that's a horrible
[34:24] disgraceful ungodly lie of the devil see
[34:26] I am your brother he said now that would
[34:28] run any person from the feet
[34:30] that would make anyone that loves Christ
[34:32] run from the very thing and you can see
[34:35] Paul's frustration in first Corinthians
[34:36] 115 verse 16
[34:39] first Corinthians 1:16 he said I'm not
[34:42] baptized also so Paul it's almost like
[34:44] he's remembering he says I baptized also
[34:47] the household household of stephanas
[34:50] besides i know not whether i baptized
[34:53] any other we're gonna close with verse
[34:55] 16 but i just want to kind of dwell on
[34:58] that for a minute because it's
[35:00] interesting that paul being a messenger
[35:01] to the age and he's writing or dictating
[35:05] this to be written and he says i didn't
[35:09] baptize anyone but Crispus and Gaius
[35:11] then he comes back and says but I also
[35:13] baptize the household was Stephanus he
[35:16] said and I don't know if I baptized
[35:17] anyone else at least he was honest with
[35:19] us because Paul wasn't infallible
[35:22] messengers are not personally infallible
[35:25] this Bible that was written as
[35:27] infallible but Paul personally as a
[35:29] messenger as a prophet was not
[35:30] infallible in his personal life
[35:32] neither was brother Brandon and the
[35:34] reason we know that is because brother
[35:36] Branham says it but the Branham says men
[35:37] are not infallible but God is he says
[35:40] man you get your mind on a man he'll
[35:42] make a mistake and that's always gonna
[35:44] be the truth if you think there's a man
[35:46] you say well Apollo's feeds me in such a
[35:48] way that man I I can only get it from
[35:50] him or what happens if something happens
[35:52] to a Paulus are you gonna follow then
[35:55] you better do is as Jesus said come
[35:57] follow me come follow me
[36:00] that's what we want to do tonight he
[36:01] said you get your mind on a man he'll
[36:03] make a mistake
[36:04] maybe not willfully but he'll do it God
[36:06] permits him to do it so that he can
[36:09] shake your faith away from man he says
[36:13] our faith is not in the wisdom of men
[36:15] but in the power of the resurrection of
[36:19] Jesus Christ but you know I want to tell
[36:24] you tonight and closing that God is
[36:27] infallible I hope we know that that make
[36:33] us really trust him wouldn't it to know
[36:36] that he's never wrong he never has to
[36:39] rethink anything never has to go back
[36:41] and see what he did wrong and try to
[36:43] learn from it he never learned anything
[36:45] he's Elohim the self-existing God he
[36:48] existed before time and he knew all
[36:51] things God is infallible so brother
[36:54] Branham tells us stay with the word God
[36:57] is infallible God is the infinite one
[36:59] who cannot change
[37:01] he's unchangeable the unchangeable God
[37:05] the same one that fell on the day of
[37:07] Pentecost and filled all the house with
[37:09] a rushing mighty wind and cloven tongues
[37:12] of fire set upon them and they were all
[37:14] filled with the Holy Ghost he said
[37:17] that's the same God that we look to see
[37:20] today it depends on what you're looking
[37:23] for he says we talked about Easter
[37:25] expectations on Sunday this is what he
[37:29] says the infinite God I am God and I
[37:32] changed not he doesn't change he can't
[37:36] change if that's what he give those
[37:38] first expectance and I like that
[37:41] those first expectance back there if
[37:44] that's what he give those people that's
[37:47] what he gives the second expectance
[37:49] that's what it gives the third fourth
[37:53] everyone he calls will be the same thing
[37:58] so glad we serve an infallible God in
[38:02] times like these we need a God whose
[38:04] infallible we need a God who knows all
[38:07] about us God who is able to touch our
[38:10] hearts in a way that nobody else can as
[38:14] we continue to study the book of 1st
[38:16] Corinthians I pray that it'll be a help
[38:18] to you in some way we'll continue it in
[38:19] some way whether we do it at the church
[38:21] once we're able to open back up or
[38:23] whether we do it from in videos from
[38:25] time to time like this but I trust it
[38:28] would be a blessing to you the word of
[38:29] God is alive and powerful and sharper
[38:31] than any two-edged sword and we believe
[38:33] it has purpose and power in your life
[38:36] tonight and will not go forth boy let's
[38:38] pray one more time Heavenly Father thank
[38:42] you for letting us come together tonight
[38:43] even if it's by way of the internet god
[38:48] I pray that your spirit would just rest
[38:50] on these words that's been spoken
[38:52] tonight
[38:53] Lourdes is a different format for me and
[38:56] I'm a little bit nervous but no God that
[38:59] you're the same yesterday today and
[39:00] forever and you never change and you're
[39:02] infallible so we know you don't make any
[39:05] mistakes
[39:06] father you called us to be here and be
[39:09] in this place tonight somehow was in
[39:10] your will for me to do this and for us
[39:13] to be here and for these that are
[39:14] listening to listen pray you'd bless the
[39:17] hearer Lord may they hear your word may
[39:20] they go and study at Lourdes and be like
[39:22] like I am tonight in my heart god I
[39:25] don't want to be like the ones who said
[39:27] I'm a Paul or I'm of Apollo's or I
[39:29] identify with this doctrine or that one
[39:31] but I want to be like you lord I want to
[39:35] be a real Christian I want to be one
[39:37] with the body of Christ I don't want to
[39:39] be separated hanging on by a thread but
[39:41] I want to be one with the body of Christ
[39:44] let those things that have been Lord
[39:47] hurt those that have been torn
[39:51] let them be healed tonight we pray in
[39:54] Jesus name Amen god bless you we'll see
[39:57] you Sunday
