[36:58] this morning that you'd like to make
[37:00] known my wife uplifted a hand I know God
[37:02] sees those needs today and we've seen
[37:06] that he's a miracle working God I don't
[37:09] know what it is but he knows and he's
[37:11] able to do that today father as we come
[37:14] in this atmosphere Lord under the
[37:17] freshness of the Spirit of God
[37:19] we asked you Lord to just move in every
[37:22] life Lord take those things that we have
[37:26] need of and make them miracles in our
[37:29] lives Lord a strength Lord and a
[37:32] blessing because we know father that
[37:35] you've met our needs before and you're
[37:38] going to meet them again we believe that
[37:41] father whatever it is spiritual

[37:45] you're a healer we believe you're a
[37:47] saviour God we believe that you're the
[37:50] same yesterday today and forever

[37:55] annoying every soul with faith Lord to
[37:58] believe your word and to know whatever

[38:03] morning father I pray for this service
[38:06] we don't want to take it just as another
[38:08] service today but we want it to be Lord
[38:12] at that time when we may be the last
[38:14] time we could ever meet together
[38:16] Oh God if it is may all of those needs
[38:19] to be met today may there be a just a
[38:22] certainty in our heart when we leave
[38:23] this place that you were here with us
[38:26] and if you're here Lord then everything
[38:28] will be okay I pray you grant it now and
[38:31] we thank you for all that you've done
[38:33] move me out of the way today and may you
[38:35] speak to your people we pray in Jesus
[38:38] name
[38:39] amen and God bless you you couldn't be
[38:45] seated for just a moment there's just a
[38:46] couple of things I want to go over
[38:48] before we get into the preaching this
[38:51] morning thank you for the music I
[38:53] enjoyed very much the music this morning
[38:55] it's good to have all of you here with
[38:57] us
[38:58] it's good to have both Tom and sister
[39:00] Nancy with us and it's been good to have
[39:02] you all with us over these this time
[39:05] that I've been here and I appreciate
[39:06] that and you're very much a part of the
[39:09] church family we want you to know that
[39:10] and and perhaps you'll be able to
[39:12] something will happen you'll be able to
[39:13] stay but if you do have to leave then we
[39:16] understand it and thank God if you have
[39:19] family clothes that you're able to
[39:21] fellowship with and be around you want
[39:23] to be close to your family and I know
[39:25] they do and and but we're family as well
[39:28] we'll continue to be wherever you live
[39:30] so we appreciate you guys we've been
[39:33] dealing with this coronavirus thing for
[39:35] months now and I know you're sick of
[39:38] hearing about it but but we've reached a
[39:42] place where as you can see we've taken
[39:43] the ropes off the pews and we're able to
[39:45] sit where we want to within reason and
[39:49] and things like that
[39:50] we've not moved out of the woods yet the
[39:52] state is still the cases are increasing
[39:55] and things like that but we've got to be
[39:58] a church we've got it there's some
[39:59] things we have to do to be a church and
[40:01] so we want to do those things and
[40:03] continue to wash your hands and stay
[40:05] safe and don't come to church if you're
[40:07] sick and that goes against everything
[40:09] I've ever done because I've always went
[40:11] to church sick but but if you're sick
[40:13] during this time it'd be best to stay
[40:15] home and and not spread that and and to
[40:18] stay safe and use the common sense that
[40:22] God gave us and we'll attempt to
[40:24] continue to do things in a common-sense
[40:26] way you've noticed that we we've not
[40:28] been passing the offering plate and it's
[40:30] not because we don't believe in taking
[40:32] offerings but it's just because it
[40:34] reduces the chance of spread and so it's
[40:38] back there in the back and you're
[40:39] welcome to use that and we will resume
[40:41] that at some point there's some things
[40:45] that are going to be coming up and I
[40:46] know that you're busy during the summer
[40:48] and so I want you to kind of keep these
[40:50] dates in mind so if you're going to be
[40:53] going
[40:53] and you can kind of keep these dates in
[40:55] mind that you can try to be here if you
[40:56] can but Andrew Glover will be with us on
[41:00] Wednesday and I apologize that it's on a
[41:03] Wednesday night but he's coming through
[41:04] the area he'll be with us on Wednesday
[41:06] June 24th so put that on your calendar
[41:09] but Andrew I know you love him and I
[41:11] love his ministry as well it love him
[41:13] and and he's a real friend and so we
[41:16] want him to come and then but Aaron
[41:19] McGarry is supposed to be here on the
[41:22] weekend of the 28th and that's in pencil
[41:25] we're not positive of that yet but just
[41:27] keep that date in mind as well
[41:29] so if we do if he does come we'll have
[41:32] two services that weekend along the 28th
[41:34] and depending of course on the
[41:37] circumstances with the coronavirus I'd
[41:39] like to begin having two services and
[41:41] would you pray with me about that but
[41:43] what we can do on Sundays and and you
[41:47] know I would I'd love to be in church
[41:49] all the time but I don't want to wear
[41:51] you out either and so we want to do the
[41:52] best we can to work together as a church
[41:54] towards that end so and then we haven't
[42:00] had communion in a long time and I've
[42:03] become convinced that we need to have a
[42:05] more regular communion of foot washing
[42:06] service it's been impossible to do
[42:09] during the pandemic we want to do that
[42:11] during the month of July and the weekend
[42:14] that looks like it would work for that
[42:15] because the first weekend of the month
[42:17] is a is a holiday weekend and some of
[42:21] you will be gone so we're going to try
[42:22] to do that on July 12th the Lord willing
[42:24] and again it's subject to all of these
[42:27] conditions with the coronavirus and
[42:29] things but we're going to try to have a
[42:31] communion and foot washing service on
[42:32] July 12th the Lord willing so keep that
[42:35] in mind because I know it's been a long
[42:36] time and and we want to do that to
[42:39] fulfill our expectation because he said
[42:41] do this until I come and so we want to
[42:44] continue to keep that that ordinance but
[42:48] the Darrell Ward is supposed to be here
[42:50] also in July on the 19th and he's got a
[42:54] trip planned for overseas he's probably
[42:56] not going to be able to go and so I've
[42:58] asked him to come here if he can't go
[42:59] overseas and so that would be on the
[43:01] 19th if we could it'd be nice
[43:04] by then if we could have a dinner
[43:06] during that time and so it'd be nice to
[43:10] try to do that on the 19th so these are
[43:12] things that are coming up and those
[43:13] dates again the 24th of this month for
[43:16] the Andrew Glover with Aaron McGarry on
[43:19] the 28th the Lord willing and then in
[43:21] July on the 90 on the 12th communion and
[43:24] then on the 19th the Lord willing but
[43:27] the Darrel will be here that weekend one
[43:30] more thing I'd had my heart to resume
[43:33] doing our study of first Corinthians but
[43:35] I didn't want to do that during our
[43:37] regular Wednesday night service I've
[43:38] been praying about doing that but the
[43:40] Caleb texted me the other day and asked
[43:42] if we could resume doing that and that
[43:44] meant a lot to me because I knew there
[43:45] was somebody that wanted to that took
[43:47] advantage of that and and so we want to
[43:49] try to do that I'm gonna try to do it on
[43:51] off night you don't have to be here but
[43:53] it'll be something that will be recorded
[43:54] and you'll be able to take advantage of
[43:57] that and I'd like to do that all the way
[43:59] through the scriptures we believe in the
[44:00] Bible we believe what the Bible says and
[44:03] so the Word of God is is our refuge in
[44:07] our strength and so we want to go to the
[44:09] word as much as possible learn as much
[44:11] as we can about the Word of God so I'll
[44:13] try to do that a couple of times a month
[44:15] I'm in the process of moving right now
[44:17] to Ashe flat to that area for the time
[44:20] being and so while we're doing that we
[44:22] want to take advantage or after we've
[44:24] done that we want to take advantage of
[44:26] the opportunities we have to do as much
[44:28] teaching as we can do you love the Lord
[44:31] this morning a man I know you've got
[44:33] about half of a but you welcome to ask
[44:35] me about it and and we'll remind you of
[44:37] these states as they're coming up let's
[44:39] stand together mmm Malachi chapter 4 I I
[44:48] want to take us back to the basics of
[44:51] our faith today and I want us to examine
[44:56] in our hearts as we're reading from
[44:59] Malachi chapter 4 verses 5 and 6 and
[45:03] also from Romans 1 verse 16 I want to
[45:09] examine why we believe what we believe
[45:12] and why we're here and my subject today
[45:16] is why we need the message today
[45:19] I didn't want to ask it as a question
[45:20] because it's not that I'd I'm
[45:23] questioning whether or not we need the
[45:24] message I want to tell you why we need
[45:27] the message and I want to remind us of
[45:29] that that this message is our life and
[45:34] it's what makes us different from from
[45:36] other churches and other places because
[45:38] we believe a message and we'll get into
[45:41] that today and I trust it'll be a
[45:42] blessing to you
[45:43] Malachi chapter 4 and verse 5 behold I
[45:46] will send you Elijah the Prophet before
[45:49] the coming of the Great and dreadful day
[45:51] of the Lord verse 6 and he shall turn
[45:54] the heart of the fathers to the children
[45:55] the heart of the children to their
[45:58] fathers lest I come and smite the earth
[46:01] with a curse Romans 1:16 a very familiar
[46:06] scripture says for I am not ashamed of
[46:09] the gospel of Christ is the power of God
[46:13] unto salvation to everyone that
[46:15] believeth to the Jew first and also to
[46:19] the Greek
[46:20] let's bow our heads one more time as
[46:22] we've talked for a while and just invite
[46:25] the presence of the Lord back with us
[46:26] Heavenly Father we thank you for being
[46:29] here with us today and asked you to come
[46:31] and anoint these words and move me out
[46:33] of the way so you can speak to your
[46:36] people this morning we pray in Jesus
[46:38] name Amen god bless you you could be
[46:41] seated this morning it's good to have
[46:44] you all with us this morning good to
[46:45] have my brother once again my mother
[46:47] here this morning as well and trust
[46:49] we'll be seeing more of them in the
[46:51] future there's a story that's told of a
[46:57] tool company that manufactured drill
[46:59] bits and they begin to lose money and as
[47:03] they were faced with these financial
[47:05] losses the company executives gathered
[47:07] together to discuss the problem and the
[47:10] CEO challenged the the executives of the
[47:12] company says how can we revive the bit
[47:15] market there was silence for a moment
[47:18] and finally one member of the team spoke
[47:21] up and he said there's not a market for
[47:23] bits there's a market for holes what
[47:28] people need is holes
[47:30] and they buy the bit to make the whole
[47:34] and it become a truism in business that
[47:38] the customer never buys a product but he
[47:42] buys the satisfaction of a watt or a
[47:44] need to put it another way there's no
[47:49] market for products
[47:50] there's only market for what products
[47:53] can do and you find that illustrated
[47:58] with the Xerox Corporation over the
[48:00] years and and different copy machine
[48:02] industry corporations what they've
[48:04] realized is that people don't want copy
[48:06] machines people want copies okay
[48:12] nobody's ever walk up in the morning and
[48:15] said I want a copy machine in my house I
[48:17] want a copy machine in my business
[48:18] they're in the way they're they're
[48:20] expensive they're annoying they make
[48:22] noise right but you need copies and so
[48:26] you have a copy machine because you want
[48:29] copies and we could we could take that
[48:31] you know as an analogy to other areas of
[48:34] our life and also to when it comes to
[48:37] the message of the hour and even to
[48:39] church and all of those things that it's
[48:41] not the building itself is that that we
[48:44] want we want a church because of what
[48:46] the church does we want we want to a
[48:49] message we need a message because
[48:52] there's a need for what the message does
[48:54] for us
[48:55] in our lives the message is not
[48:57] something that God sent to us on a whim
[49:00] that it would just be it would just be
[49:03] said to us and it be something that we
[49:04] could take it or leave it
[49:05] but it's something we desperately needed
[49:09] and some of you that come and it's
[49:13] easier to see if you come out of the
[49:14] world but even those of us are raised in
[49:16] the message as well there come a time in
[49:18] your life when become a desperation it
[49:20] wasn't just something that this is a
[49:22] nice new idea but I needed this message
[49:26] there's a hole in my life that needed to
[49:29] be filled there's a there's a wall
[49:31] there's a desperate need there and that
[49:34] need comes from somewhere it comes from
[49:36] God that and brother branham called it a
[49:39] deep calling to the deep
[49:41] it's something that they said if there's
[49:43] a deep calling then there's got to be a
[49:44] deep there to respond to that call and
[49:47] so something in your life cried out for
[49:50] the message of the hour something in
[49:52] your life was was calling for it and
[49:54] whether you were born in a message
[49:56] family or or you come to the message on
[49:58] your own you begin to look at it you
[50:00] begin to see I needed that
[50:02] it fills a need it's not disposable it's
[50:05] not just something I can believe today
[50:07] and then tomorrow there's some holes in
[50:09] it or some things I don't understand so
[50:11] I'll just leave it alone oh it's a it's
[50:13] a desperate longing that I have in my
[50:15] life I needed this message so much so
[50:19] that if it did not exist God would have
[50:21] to send it to me and we could ask the
[50:28] question does the need for the message
[50:29] still exist do you still need it do we
[50:37] still need it oh can we just go back to
[50:38] denominations can we go back to the
[50:41] world can we go back to what we were is
[50:43] there still something in us that cries
[50:46] out for the message of the hour is there
[50:49] still that longing that cries out mr.
[50:51] Lord
[50:51] I needed something to correct me I
[50:53] needed something to wash me I needed
[50:55] something that would have justified that
[50:57] is something that would tell me who I am
[50:59] so it's not just Irish or the message
[51:03] itself that we're looking at but it's
[51:05] that need for the message and so God
[51:07] sent a message to fill that need what is
[51:13] the message what are we talking about
[51:14] when we talk about the message the
[51:15] message is not a material object our
[51:19] place it's not a person but it is the
[51:22] revealed world of this hour the revealed
[51:27] word of this hour is the message of the
[51:29] hour and that revealed word comes to the
[51:32] prophet of Malachi for because the Bible
[51:35] tells us the word comes to the prophets
[51:37] sure the Lord God will do nothing except
[51:40] he says it by service he does it by
[51:42] servants the prophets and so we believe
[51:45] that the message come for that reason
[51:47] and now bill abarim talks about the
[51:51] message and he says notice he said it
[51:53] was not just to get
[51:54] together and talk about it but all the
[51:57] Jews come together and saying I'll tell
[51:58] you I tell you fellows you know I I
[52:00] believe that Moses is right because he
[52:03] said look we see God identifying himself
[52:05] with Moses because we see the pillar of
[52:07] fire we know what happens we know the
[52:10] identification that God has given Moses
[52:12] it's right you know he said we've got to
[52:14] have the blood in the door I believe
[52:15] that so you can believe all of that and
[52:18] you should believe all of that but
[52:21] that's not taking advantage of what the
[52:23] message offers right you can say I
[52:26] believe in copy machines I'm glad
[52:28] they're here I see what they do right
[52:32] but if you don't you have to have one in
[52:35] order to have copies and the cry of this
[52:40] age is photo capture the cry of this age
[52:44] is for a change of the body and
[52:48] something inside of us that just desires
[52:51] that we want that and so if there's
[52:53] something inside of us a deep calling
[52:55] for a rapture deep calling for a
[52:57] restoration that deep calling this
[53:00] message is what brings us through that
[53:02] 30-man so it's that calling that we have
[53:06] inside of us that actually called for
[53:09] the message of the hour very bad it
[53:13] actually produced a gulf knew you would
[53:15] need it and so by predestination he said
[53:18] it before you got here so that you would
[53:23] have it at the end time amen so now he
[53:30] said you can say I believe that we've
[53:32] got to have the blood of it all I
[53:33] believe that but you know after all I
[53:35] believe I'm just about as good as
[53:36] anybody really a covenant Jew I've been
[53:39] circumcised up in my offerings and ties
[53:41] into the congregation why even the
[53:44] priests I eat dinner with him well I'm
[53:46] just as good a man as the rest of you
[53:47] are he said that isn't what happened
[53:49] well not to come together to talk about
[53:52] the message we are come together to get
[53:55] in the message we can talk about it all
[54:00] day it's wonderful it fills a need
[54:02] there's all these things but
[54:03] we gotta get under it we gotta let that
[54:07] message come into our lives we were
[54:09] coming together to get in the message
[54:11] and the message is Christ he is the Lord
[54:15] that's right here source for the message
[54:18] of Christ he is the word he said we're
[54:20] to get into it get beneath it yes sir
[54:23] that's what we're supposed to do and I'm
[54:27] telling you this morning that needs
[54:29] still exist and I may seem very
[54:31] elementary but we need to be reminded of
[54:33] that because the devil's go do
[54:35] everything he can to make the message
[54:37] optional in your life and to make what a
[54:40] prophet tallest optional that it's just
[54:42] something can be taken or left but it's
[54:44] not optional it's something we have to
[54:46] we come under it's something that we
[54:48] surrendered to because not just because
[54:50] a prophet said but because we believe
[54:52] it's the Word of God right and so there
[54:57] was a need for the Israelites for
[54:59] protection what was that why was the
[55:03] land saying why was the Bogue put on the
[55:05] door it wasn't just because they wanted
[55:09] to redecorate their houses let's go down
[55:12] to Home Depot and buy some red paint put
[55:14] it on the door nose because God required
[55:17] it because there was a need the Death
[55:22] Angel was in her hand there was a death
[55:25] going on all over the land and in order
[55:28] to not die in order to be saved they had
[55:33] to have the message bear to hear Moses
[55:36] message and apply it it was there not
[55:39] just a sitting listen to it but they had
[55:41] to hear it and they had to apply it in
[55:42] the heart
[55:43] they had to apply put it over the top
[55:44] poster say this is mine I'm identifying
[55:47] with my family is under this message
[55:50] we're doing what a messenger said and
[55:52] when they did that they were free from
[55:54] that death and I'm here to tell you
[55:56] there's a virus and oil in today there's
[55:58] a death that is much worse than any
[56:00] coronavirus there's a death that's much
[56:02] worse than any kind of a of a sickness
[56:04] or anything they might have but there's
[56:06] a spiritual death for him today and we
[56:09] see it on every hand we
[56:10] on the faces of the people and we see it
[56:12] in denominationalism and I'm I'm not
[56:14] having those people but we see it in
[56:16] those systems that they've actually
[56:18] become that that woman that was walking
[56:22] in that brother beheld a saw in the
[56:23] vision that she was walking naked in
[56:26] front and then throw rock and roll
[56:28] beating going down into hell and we see
[56:30] the churches doing that today we see
[56:33] them actually fulfilling that vision and
[56:35] we see darkness and honey we see death
[56:37] and O'Haire and we see that the message
[56:38] of the hour brings us to a place where
[56:42] we don't have to die
[56:43] brings us to the place where not only do
[56:46] we not have to die but we can live and
[56:48] our bodies can be changed at a moment in
[56:50] a twinkling of an eye it brings us to
[56:51] the possibility and the potential for
[56:54] the rapture they needed it it was an
[57:00] optional who I can do it or maybe I just
[57:01] won't maybe I'll put it off no apply the
[57:04] token see this message we need it
[57:10] because it brings restoration Matthew 17
[57:14] and 11 says jesus answered and said unto
[57:17] them Elias truly shall first come and
[57:20] restore all things
[57:23] the early church fathers after the time
[57:26] of the other early church of Peter and
[57:29] Paul then as it went on down that there
[57:32] was taught and they understood the words
[57:35] of Christ meant that there would be
[57:37] another coming of Elijah understood in
[57:40] the early church in fact there's a man
[57:42] by the name of Albert Barnes you may or
[57:46] may not be able to read that but Albert
[57:47] Barnes was a Presbyterian theologian
[57:52] from the 1700s in this country and
[57:55] Albert Barnes when he did his commentary
[57:58] he goes through a long list of the
[58:00] people who believed that Elijah would
[58:01] come again it was understood and
[58:05] believed in the early church that this
[58:06] would take place that this was not just
[58:08] it's not something I am telling you this
[58:10] because the need for restoration was
[58:13] understood so they looked at this and
[58:16] said there going to be an Elijah come to
[58:17] restore all things and so this is Louie
[58:20] Albert Barnes puts it he said he implies
[58:21] the coming of Elijah
[58:22] other than that of John the immerser
[58:24] John the Baptist since he was already
[58:27] martyred all things were not yet
[58:29] restored he said this must also be the
[58:31] fullest fulfillment for the great and
[58:34] terrible day of the Lord is the day of
[58:35] judgment of which all earthly judgments
[58:38] however desolating is the destruction of
[58:40] Jerusalem are but shadows and Ernests so
[58:43] he understood he said before Lord's
[58:44] coming all things return to his first
[58:47] coming since that coming whole it's on
[58:49] to the second which is the completion of
[58:51] the first and of all things in time our
[58:54] Lord's words Elias truth shall first
[58:56] come and restore all things Albert
[58:58] Barnes speaking it seemed to me to leave
[59:00] no question that as John the immerser
[59:03] came in the spirit and power of Elias
[59:05] before his first coming so before the
[59:08] second coming Elijah should come in
[59:10] person as Jews and Christians have a
[59:12] like expected now they believed would
[59:13] actually be Elijah and they believed he
[59:16] would come at the end and they didn't
[59:17] see that the difference that and and the
[59:19] the Tribulation Period in those things
[59:21] but the understood he had to come so
[59:25] they didn't see a difference between a
[59:26] fourth and a fifth Elijah but they knew
[59:28] he had to come right and so now they
[59:31] said he said this has been the Christian
[59:33] expectation from the first he quotes a
[59:36] man named Justin Martyr who was an early
[59:39] church father and one of the one of the
[59:41] early apologists in the church after the
[59:44] time of the Apostles and he asks someone
[59:46] he was debating with he said should we
[59:47] not conceive that the Lord of God has
[59:49] proclaimed Elias to be the forerunner of
[59:51] the great and terrible day of the second
[59:53] coming certainly was his opponents
[59:56] replied Justin continues our Lord
[59:58] Himself taught us in his own teaching
[1:00:00] that this very thing should be when he
[1:00:03] said that Elias also shall come and we
[1:00:05] know that this shall be fulfilled when
[1:00:07] he is about to come from heaven and
[1:00:09] glory I say amen to that
[1:00:13] they understood Elijah needed to come
[1:00:16] and and it wasn't just limited to them
[1:00:20] but even in by the rams town people the
[1:00:22] church understood that and today they're
[1:00:25] not looking for anything because the
[1:00:28] church has just become a a place where
[1:00:30] you go to feel good right but but back
[1:00:33] then these people understood Elijah had
[1:00:35] to come
[1:00:37] we can say like Jesus said of John
[1:00:39] except Elias has come already and we can
[1:00:42] say like Jesus that have joined that
[1:00:44] Elijah's come already and they did too
[1:00:48] and what they did to John they rejected
[1:00:50] him and but yet there's a group that
[1:00:52] believed and a group that was corrected
[1:00:55] by his message to Christ right now he
[1:00:59] needed to come to restore all things and
[1:01:01] that word restoration is to bring back
[1:01:03] to a former original or normal condition
[1:01:05] as the building statue or painting so we
[1:01:09] find that the church today as that
[1:01:11] exists in in the nominal Church is not
[1:01:12] the normal condition of the church and
[1:01:16] we shouldn't look to that as our example
[1:01:18] so we needed somebody to come to bring
[1:01:20] us back to what the church ought to be
[1:01:22] that normal condition bring us back to
[1:01:25] the original condition of the statue the
[1:01:27] original condition of God's masterpiece
[1:01:30] so then we could begin to think and
[1:01:34] ought you to think with me this morning
[1:01:36] as we begin to wonder what it would be
[1:01:38] like if the message should not come
[1:01:42] there's an old movie called It's a
[1:01:44] Wonderful Life and I'm sure you've seen
[1:01:46] it and the entire movie is most of you
[1:01:50] perhaps the entire movie is about a man
[1:01:52] named George Bailey who begins to
[1:01:56] despair of his life and thinks he hasn't
[1:01:58] done enough and so he goes out to commit
[1:02:00] suicide jump off a bridge and an angel
[1:02:03] comes to him named Clarence of course
[1:02:04] it's Hollywood but it comes to him and
[1:02:07] begins to tell him about out what is
[1:02:09] life or what life in that town would be
[1:02:12] without George Bailey what it would be
[1:02:14] like and I want us to think like that
[1:02:17] about this message if this message had
[1:02:20] never been if God had never sent a
[1:02:22] prophet what condition would we be in
[1:02:25] today
[1:02:26] and it goes beyond our it goes beyond
[1:02:31] just us today and having a church core
[1:02:33] structures like this wouldn't exist
[1:02:35] because we exist because of the message
[1:02:38] right and there's no two ways around
[1:02:40] that we're here we exist because of the
[1:02:43] message of the hour and so churches like
[1:02:45] this wouldn't exist of course but there
[1:02:48] were also have been no healing revived
[1:02:49] as far as we know in in the 40s there
[1:02:52] would have been no old Roberts Tommy
[1:02:54] Hicks jack code took their inspiration
[1:02:56] from brother Ramblers meetings I think
[1:02:58] we could save that the charismatic
[1:03:00] church that we see today TBN wouldn't
[1:03:02] exist the charismatic church and when we
[1:03:05] know that they don't accept the message
[1:03:07] but that's where it all spun from those
[1:03:10] revivals and so the Pentecostal church
[1:03:12] as the world knows that today wouldn't
[1:03:13] exist and there would be no church on
[1:03:17] the earth now think about this that
[1:03:21] teachers all of the things commonly
[1:03:23] known and understood and practiced at
[1:03:25] the time of the early church and those
[1:03:28] of you have been to different churches
[1:03:29] you could go and you could find a
[1:03:31] different kind of church and you can
[1:03:33] find one that teaches this about a
[1:03:35] certain thing that we teach it would be
[1:03:37] right but there's other things that you
[1:03:39] couldn't you couldn't sit there with and
[1:03:41] you can find another one to teach of
[1:03:43] something else but and maybe one of the
[1:03:46] teachers who oneness of the Godhead but
[1:03:47] another one that teaches a different
[1:03:49] thing that and but maybe this one
[1:03:51] doesn't teach election and you find in
[1:03:54] the church today as far as the churches
[1:03:56] that I've been to in the churches that
[1:03:57] I've studied there's no church that
[1:04:00] teaches what we do and I said what we do
[1:04:03] in the major doctrines of this message
[1:04:05] because there's a reason for that they
[1:04:08] didn't accept the Prophet we did right
[1:04:13] and so here these churches teach you
[1:04:15] know one might teach the oneness of the
[1:04:16] Godhead but they're not teach election
[1:04:19] and I don't know that just right there
[1:04:21] pretty much excludes everybody because I
[1:04:23] don't know of a single church that
[1:04:24] teaches the oneness with the Guardian
[1:04:25] and the baptism of the Holy Ghost but
[1:04:27] also election right and so you would
[1:04:31] have someone believe in holiness but
[1:04:33] have no grace some will believe in grace
[1:04:36] but have no holiness we could take
[1:04:39] something as we talked this morning
[1:04:40] about communion when you take something
[1:04:42] as simple as communion and foot washing
[1:04:43] you just try to find a church that does
[1:04:45] both right and that would have been
[1:04:48] practiced in the early church but but
[1:04:50] since then has been taken away from the
[1:04:51] church and not just in the early church
[1:04:53] but would have been practiced 100 years
[1:04:55] ago in most churches but but not today
[1:04:59] and so you think where does that come
[1:05:01] from we
[1:05:02] the communion the majority of churches
[1:05:04] today serve grape juice and crackers it
[1:05:07] don't seem like a big thing but the
[1:05:09] early church if you transported them
[1:05:11] transplanted them back to this day or up
[1:05:13] to this day and put them here they
[1:05:15] wouldn't know what to do in most
[1:05:18] churches I think about it though it
[1:05:20] would just be no don't be no familiarity
[1:05:22] to them because they were baptized in
[1:05:25] the name of Jesus Christ we've just
[1:05:27] proven my history that's what they did
[1:05:29] baptize the name of Jesus Christ and
[1:05:31] very few churches do that today and so
[1:05:35] as I said they deny the other doctrine
[1:05:37] for the early church election was a big
[1:05:38] deal back then and to the early church
[1:05:40] fathers they called themselves the elect
[1:05:43] the press they understood that but the
[1:05:47] church today doesn't understand that in
[1:05:48] large part we could go on we could say
[1:05:52] talk about holiest and there's no women
[1:05:53] preachers things like that the early
[1:05:55] church I believe would be comfortable
[1:05:59] although the times are different
[1:06:00] different kind of building things like
[1:06:01] that but they would be comfortable
[1:06:02] sitting in a message church that
[1:06:05] operated under the basics of the message
[1:06:07] but they wouldn't be comfortable sitting
[1:06:10] in a nominal church then I ask you do we
[1:06:12] need a message did we need a message if
[1:06:17] there's no need for a message then we
[1:06:19] would just continue like they were and
[1:06:20] there will be no restoration back and
[1:06:26] people are looking for something else
[1:06:28] and something to come and you know if
[1:06:30] you don't believe you have been restored
[1:06:32] then Elijah has to come right and so we
[1:06:36] believe in ideas already come now if you
[1:06:39] believe in logic aim but he didn't do
[1:06:41] everything he was supposed to do that
[1:06:42] you believe Elijah hasn't finished his
[1:06:44] job which means you're still looking for
[1:06:46] coming of Elijah and what we have isn't
[1:06:48] anything because everything could change
[1:06:52] right but we believe we have a complete
[1:06:55] revelation and it's not and people get
[1:06:59] into this word you ought to take every
[1:07:00] word and parser to know it's the
[1:07:03] doctrine and the teaching that brother
[1:07:04] impalas is a perfect revelation of
[1:07:06] Christ the things that he taught us and
[1:07:09] God corrected him on some things there's
[1:07:11] a maturing of the revelation
[1:07:13] time goes on but we can look at the
[1:07:15] totality of it and see what God was
[1:07:17] teaching to us what he was telling us
[1:07:19] it's so simple that a fool sitting there
[1:07:21] there in that's right but yet people
[1:07:25] don't understand because they don't have
[1:07:26] revelation but they're looking for
[1:07:28] Elijah to come back well I would say if
[1:07:30] you don't believe he's done his job you
[1:07:31] should be looking for him to come back
[1:07:33] but I will tell you Elijah has already
[1:07:36] been here just based on what we see
[1:07:39] today that God can work in a church like
[1:07:42] ours in a church like this and do what
[1:07:44] he said he would do are you with me so
[1:07:48] far God did in so we could say like
[1:07:52] Peter didn't John 668 that Simon Peter
[1:07:54] answered him and said Lord who shall we
[1:07:56] go well what other teacher can we go to
[1:08:00] the teaches us the things about eternal
[1:08:02] life where did we go and find what we
[1:08:05] have need of now where did we go thou
[1:08:09] hast the words of eternal life and God
[1:08:12] sent this worthless message was not but
[1:08:15] a man was message it was God's message
[1:08:17] that he sent by William Branham now you
[1:08:19] can't separate brother Branham from the
[1:08:21] message because he's that's who God sent
[1:08:23] it by so if you don't accept that
[1:08:25] messenger you never received the message
[1:08:27] but he was just the messenger right and
[1:08:31] so there you have to keep that in mind
[1:08:33] it's it's the message of Christ he told
[1:08:35] us the message is Christ so but a man
[1:08:40] taught us that and so we see that we
[1:08:43] need the message for restoration and we
[1:08:44] need this message today not only for
[1:08:46] restoration but because at the end time
[1:08:48] there is promise to be certain
[1:08:49] revelation that would be given to us so
[1:08:54] if you believe we're in the end time I
[1:08:55] think the probably the biggest obstacle
[1:08:58] to accepting this message would be if
[1:08:59] you didn't believe we were at the end
[1:09:01] time but you can talk to just about
[1:09:04] anybody but a JT in the store that sees
[1:09:07] what's going on and they think we're at
[1:09:08] the end time if they have any Bible
[1:09:10] knowledge at all they understand that
[1:09:13] this is this getting close to the end
[1:09:15] time we're getting close and so and so
[1:09:18] but you have to kind of accept that to
[1:09:19] believe the message you have to believe
[1:09:22] that we're at the end time but if you
[1:09:23] just look at history that enough should
[1:09:25] teach
[1:09:25] it's just the view of history that were
[1:09:27] at the end time it just can't go on like
[1:09:30] it is and so we find what at the end
[1:09:32] time in believing that then the Bible
[1:09:34] promises that there would be revelation
[1:09:36] and and things that would be unsealed at
[1:09:38] the end time so that we could see it
[1:09:42] right it'd be unveiled in film Daniel
[1:09:44] twelve and four he said but Thou O
[1:09:46] Daniel shut up the words seal the book
[1:09:49] even that to the time of the end he said
[1:09:52] many shall run to and fro and knowledge
[1:09:54] shall be increased but see he said
[1:09:57] sealed up to the time of the end no
[1:09:59] Matthew Henry said this about this verse
[1:10:01] he said truth is the daughter of time
[1:10:03] truth is the daughter of time so God
[1:10:07] brings truth with time at the right time
[1:10:11] right truth is the daughter of time
[1:10:14] scripture prophecies will be expounded
[1:10:15] by the accomplishment of them therefore
[1:10:18] they are given and that's for that
[1:10:21] reason they were reserved there told us
[1:10:23] before that when they do come to pass
[1:10:24] when they believe but there told us in
[1:10:27] mystery form so that we can when it
[1:10:30] comes to pass only the wise will see
[1:10:33] right but now how would God get that
[1:10:37] mystery to us Daniel 2 / 9 again he said
[1:10:39] go thy way Daniel for the words are
[1:10:41] closed up and sealed till the time at
[1:10:43] the end right till the time of him many
[1:10:48] shall be purified and made white and
[1:10:49] tried but the wicked should do wickedly
[1:10:51] none of the wicked shall understand but
[1:10:53] the wise shall understand the words are
[1:10:56] closed up the prophecy should not be
[1:10:58] understood but in its accomplishment and
[1:11:00] this is Adam Clarke speaking he said the
[1:11:03] prophecy should not be understood but in
[1:11:05] its accomplishment and then the depth of
[1:11:07] the wisdom and Providence of God will be
[1:11:09] clearly seen in these matters he said we
[1:11:12] must wait till the time of the end and
[1:11:14] and he actually takes it and did some
[1:11:17] calculations based on numbers in the
[1:11:20] book of Daniel which I don't agree with
[1:11:21] his calculations but I agree with his
[1:11:23] conclusion he said will not arrive
[1:11:25] before the 20th century and he's writing
[1:11:28] that in the in the 17th century in the
[1:11:31] 18th century and he's writing at the end
[1:11:33] of the 17th century at beginning I
[1:11:34] believe in the 18th century and he's
[1:11:35] writing these things and
[1:11:37] says it won't be until the 20th century
[1:11:39] but now we see the end times
[1:11:43] he said we here see the reason why these
[1:11:45] prophecies are at present so imperfectly
[1:11:47] understood so he's saying it's not time
[1:11:49] for it yet but it will come a time it'll
[1:11:51] be understood the audience understood
[1:11:54] that ministers understood that and in
[1:11:58] Revelations 10 4 the Bible tells us when
[1:12:01] the seven thunders about as their voices
[1:12:03] I was about to ride and heard a voice
[1:12:04] from heaven saying unto me seal up those
[1:12:06] things which the seven thunders either
[1:12:07] write them not the angel chimed so stand
[1:12:10] upon the sea and upon the earth lifted
[1:12:11] up his hand to heaven and swore by him
[1:12:13] that liveth for ever and ever who
[1:12:15] created the heavens and the things that
[1:12:16] therein are earth and the things that
[1:12:18] there are all in the sea the things
[1:12:20] which are therein that there should be
[1:12:21] time no longer
[1:12:23] you can't call us that were in the end
[1:12:25] time any more than that me John Logan or
[1:12:28] more delay if you look in the margin but
[1:12:31] he said but in the days of the voice of
[1:12:32] the seventh angel when he should begin
[1:12:35] to sound the mystery of God should be
[1:12:37] finished as he hath declared to his
[1:12:40] servants the prophets so here he says
[1:12:41] there'll be a mystery sealed up to the
[1:12:43] end time and here he says in the days of
[1:12:45] the voice of the seventh angel the
[1:12:47] mystery of God will be finished so and
[1:12:51] he said as he has declared to his
[1:12:53] servants the prophets so if it come by a
[1:12:55] prophet it also need to be revealed by a
[1:12:57] prophet and so if you look at the
[1:13:01] scripture honestly if we don't believe
[1:13:02] in this prophet we have to look for
[1:13:04] another one right and the reason why
[1:13:08] people look for another one even around
[1:13:09] the message is because they don't
[1:13:10] believe this one because if you believe
[1:13:14] this one you will know it for another
[1:13:17] remember what when when I like it when
[1:13:20] the Elijah that day when John's Eagle I
[1:13:24] got filmed over he got put in prison and
[1:13:27] Matthew 11 2 says when John had heard
[1:13:29] the prison the works of Christ he said
[1:13:31] to his disciples and said unto Him art
[1:13:34] thou either should come or do we look
[1:13:36] for another prophet do we look for
[1:13:39] another message do we look for another
[1:13:40] Christ he said either should come until
[1:13:45] we look for another jesus answered and
[1:13:47] said unto me go and show John again
[1:13:49] those
[1:13:49] things which you do here and see hey man
[1:13:52] look what the message does amen
[1:13:55] see if it meets the lead amen
[1:13:59] he said the blind receive their sight
[1:14:01] the lame walk the lepers are cleansed
[1:14:03] the Deaf hear the dead are raised up the
[1:14:05] poor but the gospel preached thundered
[1:14:07] him you said well I've never seen that
[1:14:10] well I have because I can identify with
[1:14:12] all those things I've been spiritually
[1:14:15] deaf
[1:14:16] I've been spiritually dead I've been
[1:14:18] poor in the spiritual and the natural
[1:14:20] and the gospel was preached to me amen
[1:14:25] by they needed cleanse from sin I've
[1:14:29] been those things and the gospel is
[1:14:30] preached to me he said him blessed is he
[1:14:32] whosoever shall not be offended in me
[1:14:36] that's to the scene whose service should
[1:14:39] not be offended in me so god seated up
[1:14:44] the mystery until the time of the end
[1:14:46] and then we have to say is this him or
[1:14:49] if not we should be getting ready for
[1:14:51] another I stay this morning he's met the
[1:14:55] need of my life and when I say he I mean
[1:14:59] Jesus Christ our Lord has met the need
[1:15:01] by providing a message through a
[1:15:03] messenger in our time now we find that
[1:15:08] an example of this if you if you're
[1:15:10] still wondering about whether God those
[1:15:11] things this way look what God did with
[1:15:13] the mystery of grace to the Gentiles he
[1:15:18] sealed it up for thousands of years for
[1:15:22] four thousand years this was sealed up
[1:15:24] it was there but they didn't understand
[1:15:27] it well look at that and I say 11:10 it
[1:15:31] says in that day there shall be a root
[1:15:32] of Jesse would stand for an inside of
[1:15:35] the people to it shall the Gentiles seek
[1:15:36] and the read and read his rest shall be
[1:15:39] glorious
[1:15:40] none of seems pretty plain to us we know
[1:15:44] what that means because we're Gentiles
[1:15:46] seeking that root of Jesse right but to
[1:15:50] someone to a Jew or to someone who lived
[1:15:53] before the opening of this if we could
[1:15:55] save this seal that's understanding
[1:15:57] that's this mystery before the opening
[1:16:00] of this they didn't understand it wasn't
[1:16:02] common knowledge that the gospel would
[1:16:05] go to the Gentiles and in fact many even
[1:16:09] in the in the Jewish church and they
[1:16:11] that accepted Christ couldn't accept
[1:16:14] this mystery but ball believed it
[1:16:18] because it was given to him it was
[1:16:20] revealed to him hey man now Isaiah 66 19
[1:16:25] again it was written he said I will set
[1:16:27] aside among them I will send those that
[1:16:29] escape with him into the unto the
[1:16:30] nations to Tarshish Pro and Lord to draw
[1:16:33] the boat to to Baal and Javan to the
[1:16:34] Isles of far off that have not heard my
[1:16:36] fame
[1:16:37] neither have seen my glory and they
[1:16:39] shall declare my glory among the
[1:16:41] Gentiles isaiah 42:1 behold my servant
[1:16:45] whom i pulled my elect and whom my soul
[1:16:48] delighteth i have put my spirit upon him
[1:16:50] he shall bring forth judgment to the
[1:16:53] Gentiles but but it was a mystery and we
[1:16:56] look back and say pastor it should have
[1:16:58] been playing to them but they didn't
[1:17:00] understand because it took God's man the
[1:17:03] Apostle Paul to bring it out to him
[1:17:05] it took that messenger to bring that
[1:17:08] because it wasn't time yet but when it
[1:17:10] was time God called a man to bring the
[1:17:12] message some else in in Matthew the
[1:17:18] early church understood that had been
[1:17:20] fulfilled in Matthew 1217 Matthew writes
[1:17:23] he said that it might be fulfilled which
[1:17:24] was spoken by Isaiah the prophet saying
[1:17:27] behold my servant whom I've chosen my
[1:17:29] beloved whom my soul is well pleased I
[1:17:30] will put my spirit upon him he showed so
[1:17:33] judgment to the Gentiles he shall not
[1:17:35] strive nor crying neither shall any man
[1:17:36] hear his voice in the streets bruised
[1:17:38] Reed shall he not break smoking flax
[1:17:40] shall he not quench till he sent forth
[1:17:42] judgment unto victory and in his name
[1:17:44] shall the Gentiles trust you can also go
[1:17:49] into Jeremiah in different places but
[1:17:51] there's one more place in Isaiah in
[1:17:52] Isaiah 49 6 he said it is a light thing
[1:17:56] that thou should have to be my servant
[1:17:58] to raise up the tribes of Jacob and to
[1:18:00] restore the preserved of Israel I will
[1:18:02] also give me for a light to the Gentiles
[1:18:04] and and the Jews understood this was
[1:18:07] speaking of the Messiah but he said I
[1:18:10] will also give me for a light to the
[1:18:11] Gentiles that that must be my salvation
[1:18:13] unto the end of the earth
[1:18:16] now this is again evident now but only
[1:18:18] because the mystery was revealed Paul
[1:18:22] does that in Ephesians chapter 3 and
[1:18:23] verse 1 he said for this cause i paul
[1:18:25] the prisoner of jesus christ for you
[1:18:27] gentiles if you have heard of the
[1:18:30] dispensation of the grace of god which
[1:18:33] is given me to you word so Paul is
[1:18:36] saying God trusted me with this mystery
[1:18:38] with the understanding of it how that by
[1:18:42] revelation he made known unto me the
[1:18:43] mystery as I wrote afore in C words
[1:18:46] whereby when you read you may understand
[1:18:48] my knowledge in the mystery of Christ
[1:18:50] which in other ages was not made known
[1:18:53] unto the sons of men as it has now
[1:18:55] revealed unto his holy apostles and
[1:18:57] prophets by the spirit that the Gentiles
[1:19:00] should be fellow hairs and of the same
[1:19:02] body and partakers of his promise in
[1:19:04] Christ by the gospel he said this was
[1:19:07] hid but God revealed it to me so why do
[1:19:11] we think it's strange that something was
[1:19:12] hid and revealed at the end time without
[1:19:16] this message we don't understand what
[1:19:17] the book says about the end and without
[1:19:20] this message were troubled and the
[1:19:22] flowing people don't understand the
[1:19:24] message correctly and they don't it's
[1:19:26] not taught correctly what they do is
[1:19:28] they get worried to get fearful because
[1:19:31] they see everything happening and they
[1:19:32] don't understand it but we understand we
[1:19:36] understand at the end the wise letter
[1:19:38] said what do we understand we understand
[1:19:40] that God sent us a message to get ready
[1:19:42] so we know these things we know it's
[1:19:45] getting worse and worse the church is
[1:19:47] still looking for worldwide revival but
[1:19:49] we know better we know that the coming
[1:19:52] of the Lord is near
[1:19:53] without this message we don't understand
[1:19:56] that because the book is still sealed oh
[1:19:59] my we can only understand that the book
[1:20:02] is open which means that we can have an
[1:20:04] understanding of who you are and what
[1:20:07] time we live in let me say this as well
[1:20:12] that we need this message today because
[1:20:14] it makes Christ real to our generation
[1:20:18] we're not just preaching a Christ of
[1:20:20] history we're not just preaching a God
[1:20:23] of two thousand years ago but we're
[1:20:26] preaching Christ today
[1:20:28] and it's just as dangerous and excuse me
[1:20:30] for a moment but if you're going to take
[1:20:32] a crisis of history if you only preach a
[1:20:34] message of history then that's just as
[1:20:37] dangerous as only preaching a crisis of
[1:20:38] history the message that we received is
[1:20:41] still alive today the messages of life
[1:20:44] the message Joe does what it does and
[1:20:48] these things that we've been taught are
[1:20:50] important it's not one it's not that
[1:20:55] well we can leave that off and we'll
[1:20:56] just sleep no we believe what we've been
[1:20:58] taught with an understanding we
[1:21:00] understand that it was not another
[1:21:01] scripture another Bible but it was God
[1:21:03] interpreting his word bringing it to
[1:21:06] pass and showing it at the end time and
[1:21:07] showing us that he was real that he is
[1:21:10] real and so we don't do what we do in
[1:21:13] spite of the message we do what we do
[1:21:16] because of the message and as a pastor
[1:21:19] and I want you to understand this as we
[1:21:21] go into these at this time as we're just
[1:21:23] beginning I want us to understand that
[1:21:26] everything I do I have to do it under
[1:21:28] the umbrella of the message I can't go
[1:21:31] outside the boundary of that I don't
[1:21:33] have that authority because I believe
[1:21:36] God sent a message no more than Luther
[1:21:39] had the authority to go outside of the
[1:21:41] boundary of his message of justification
[1:21:44] or Wesley his message and those who were
[1:21:45] faithfully taught taught what they
[1:21:47] thought but brother Brown said me were
[1:21:49] not me many did not understand how
[1:21:52] important it was to say what the
[1:21:54] messenger said and we were saying that
[1:21:56] it's not that is important so much too
[1:21:58] to repeat the words that he repeated but
[1:22:01] to convey the message to convey the
[1:22:06] message so that order remained in the
[1:22:09] formulas given in the spirit of it in
[1:22:11] the power of it in the in the image of
[1:22:15] the fullness of it it would remain to
[1:22:16] our generation and so you can say well
[1:22:19] we can take the words of it but you
[1:22:21] could take a translation of English you
[1:22:23] take a translation of this sermon today
[1:22:24] put it in French and it might mean
[1:22:26] something a little different but if I
[1:22:28] could ever make someone who was French I
[1:22:30] hope you listening to me now I
[1:22:33] understand what I'm saying
[1:22:37] if I could ever get across to them the
[1:22:39] mystery of what I'm saying
[1:22:41] that person could teach those who
[1:22:42] understood eeeh oh my and if I could
[1:22:49] ever what God needs on the surface not
[1:22:52] just people who can we want to say what
[1:22:54] the Prophet said but not just to repeat
[1:22:55] the words but to understand what he
[1:22:58] understood in the sense and I believe he
[1:23:01] made it plain to us he didn't leave it
[1:23:03] in mystery form and of course something
[1:23:05] left to mystery it's something that we
[1:23:07] didn't need to know and so those things
[1:23:10] we still don't understand that are
[1:23:11] written there we had we start to come to
[1:23:13] an understanding we don't put a period
[1:23:14] on what we believe what we understand we
[1:23:17] believe there's still mystery to us but
[1:23:19] not mystery to the prophet of the age
[1:23:21] and and even it might have been spoken
[1:23:23] in the mystery form and we see it come
[1:23:25] to pass right we can see that we can
[1:23:28] identify that but it's still this
[1:23:30] message okay so we need this message
[1:23:34] today because it makes Christ's real it
[1:23:37] puts to our generation I have confidence
[1:23:42] as we preached on Wednesday night I have
[1:23:45] confidence because God sent a prophet
[1:23:47] that spoke in my generation have
[1:23:49] confidence that what he said was true
[1:23:51] and then God identified him with the
[1:23:53] sign of the Son of Man which will look
[1:23:54] at God identified him as the prophet of
[1:23:57] the age and identified not only that but
[1:24:00] identified his own presence with us if
[1:24:03] he identified himself present with us
[1:24:05] then I believe he's still here today and
[1:24:08] so I preached under those auspices now
[1:24:10] under my own authority but under the
[1:24:13] message and if I failed to believe the
[1:24:16] message you know why did I keep
[1:24:17] pastoring why would I keep preaching
[1:24:20] because this is all I know to preach are
[1:24:24] you with me now and not because I just
[1:24:26] don't understand anything else but
[1:24:28] because this is truth to me and it's
[1:24:33] truth because it's made real in my life
[1:24:36] so in Luke 17 to 28 he says likewise
[1:24:41] also as it was in the days of lot they
[1:24:42] did eat they drank they bought they sold
[1:24:44] they planted they builded but the same
[1:24:46] day that lot went out of Sodom it rained
[1:24:48] fire and brimstone from heaven and
[1:24:49] destroyed them all even thus shall it be
[1:24:52] in the day when the Sun
[1:24:53] manus revealed it's revealed that is to
[1:24:56] say is present all along and this is
[1:25:00] from the pulpit commentary and and I'm
[1:25:03] bringing these Saints today from these
[1:25:04] commentaries and things to show you that
[1:25:06] this was understood this need was
[1:25:08] understood but they didn't see who did
[1:25:09] it they didn't see that the message did
[1:25:12] it because I hadn't come yet but they
[1:25:13] saw that there was one needed so now he
[1:25:16] says he's been present all along to the
[1:25:19] wrong age of the waiting only an
[1:25:21] impenetrable veil has hid him for more
[1:25:23] lives but there comes a day when the Son
[1:25:26] of Man is revealed and but the random
[1:25:30] goes back always to Abraham and Sarah
[1:25:34] and how of it when the angel come to
[1:25:36] them he knew the secret of satis heart
[1:25:38] and the tip behind it and that was stand
[1:25:42] in our generation for the first time
[1:25:44] that in 2,000 years that we know of it
[1:25:48] was done in our generation look
[1:25:50] and so that proved who he want us to
[1:25:53] prove that that God was in the flesh on
[1:25:55] the earth and now we find that God is in
[1:25:58] flesh today on the earth proved it he
[1:26:02] was in the flesh of a prophet he's in
[1:26:03] the flesh today of a ride in a measure
[1:26:05] you understand none of us are the
[1:26:08] fullness of God the Godhead but we have
[1:26:09] Christ in a measure but Christ is in
[1:26:12] flesh now and he was in a measure in his
[1:26:15] prophet but he come and proved himself
[1:26:17] to be there now what did he do
[1:26:20] when he revealed himself to Abraham he
[1:26:22] knew the secret of Sarah's heart when he
[1:26:25] was revealed to the Jesus he knew the
[1:26:26] secret of Philip and Nathanael knew the
[1:26:29] secret of Peter was nameless was father
[1:26:32] was when he was revealed to the
[1:26:34] Samaritans he knew how many husbands the
[1:26:37] woman at the wall had and when he was
[1:26:40] revealed in our day he knew people's
[1:26:43] house numbers and where they come from
[1:26:45] what their sickness was the same God now
[1:26:51] look the man said the presence of Jesus
[1:26:54] Christ which ought to illuminate the
[1:26:56] church to know that in this last case
[1:26:59] were Creed's and denominations and isms
[1:27:03] and everything has got the word
[1:27:04] smothered out and Jesus the word on the
[1:27:07] outside of the church and you seen him
[1:27:10] come right back among the people and
[1:27:12] identify himself as promised yes he
[1:27:15] promised in the last day when the Son of
[1:27:17] Man is being revealed he was revealed in
[1:27:20] the baptism he was revealed in divine
[1:27:22] healing here he is in his last attribute
[1:27:25] he said remember that was the last thing
[1:27:27] that Abraham saw before the fire fell
[1:27:30] and judge the Gentile wall and before
[1:27:32] the promised son came on the scene Isaac
[1:27:33] this is the last thing that the
[1:27:36] Christian Church will see in the sign of
[1:27:38] miracle until the appearing of Jesus
[1:27:40] Christ I hope you with me now again
[1:27:45] we're not looking for earth-shaking
[1:27:47] science we believe in miracles we're not
[1:27:51] looking for miracles and science to
[1:27:53] shake the earth God already did that
[1:27:55] he'll do that again to the Jews but
[1:27:58] that's not promised our generation
[1:27:59] brother Brown is very clear about that
[1:28:01] he said this is the last thing the
[1:28:03] Christian Church will see in the sign of
[1:28:04] miracle until the appearing of Jesus
[1:28:06] Christ if God has give me a favor before
[1:28:08] you he said believe me in the name of
[1:28:10] the Lord there's nothing else left in
[1:28:13] the Bible to be done but take on the
[1:28:15] mark of the beast he said but and you
[1:28:18] have the seal of God amen and so you sit
[1:28:27] there on do you get worried people worry
[1:28:29] about that what's the mark of the beast
[1:28:30] right now I'm afraid they're gonna put a
[1:28:32] chip in my hand they're gonna tattoo me
[1:28:33] they're gonna do something like that no
[1:28:34] you don't have to be afraid why because
[1:28:38] you're the seal of God
[1:28:40] the antidote to not taking the mark of
[1:28:44] the beast is not to refuse the
[1:28:45] vaccination or refuse a number or
[1:28:47] something like that but but it's to have
[1:28:49] the seal of God and if you have the seal
[1:28:52] of God you'll know what to accept or
[1:28:53] what to refuse you won't accept the
[1:28:56] teaching of the church or you won't
[1:28:59] accept to do the deeds of the Church of
[1:29:01] the Catholic Church or the the nominal
[1:29:03] church but you'll you refuse to take the
[1:29:06] mark of the beast because you have the
[1:29:07] seal of God why because God made himself
[1:29:11] president our day
[1:29:13] hey man but Jesus said when the Son of
[1:29:17] Man is revealed from heaven but the
[1:29:19] brown says let me close by saying this
[1:29:22] that the Son of Man is now being
[1:29:23] revealed from heaven will it come after
[1:29:26] a while brother branham it is now and I
[1:29:30] hope I won't have to make this so
[1:29:31] personal instead of this own meeting but
[1:29:33] that your spirit within you this give
[1:29:35] you by God can read what I'm talking
[1:29:37] about
[1:29:37] the Son of man has already come from
[1:29:40] glory and is revealing himself for the
[1:29:42] past few years just search in mercy and
[1:29:49] the reason why I needed this message was
[1:29:51] and the reason why it had to become real
[1:29:53] to me but cannabis because I needed
[1:29:55] mercy you needed mercy you needed God to
[1:30:01] pour out his mercy on a generation
[1:30:03] that's lost God has forgot about God
[1:30:05] that doesn't understand God we need
[1:30:07] God's mercy we need God's mercy so our
[1:30:10] homes could be right we needed God's
[1:30:12] mercy so our churches can be right we
[1:30:14] need God's mercy so that we can have
[1:30:16] what we have
[1:30:17] I don't preachers fighter the message I
[1:30:20] preached because a prophet told me to do
[1:30:22] what I do and the reason why my prophet
[1:30:24] told me that was the mercy of God the
[1:30:25] mercy of God that allows us to have
[1:30:27] church like we do it's some mercies of
[1:30:30] God that he sent a message and didn't
[1:30:32] just leave us in dead denominations
[1:30:34] he has come now in mercy revealing
[1:30:37] himself to his church amen
[1:30:41] it's being laughed at and scoffed at is
[1:30:44] it today
[1:30:44] be laughed at all over the world stuff
[1:30:47] to him but Jesus was laughed at he was
[1:30:50] scoffed at when he was here the bride
[1:30:52] will be rejected as well
[1:30:54] the masterpiece has got to be rejected
[1:30:58] he said the next time he reveals himself
[1:31:00] it'll be in judgment on the world and
[1:31:02] the nations have forgot God and sinned
[1:31:04] the way of grace they're damned grace
[1:31:06] away listen he revealed himself to us
[1:31:10] and mercy he will reveal himself to them
[1:31:13] in judgment we got a sneak peek because
[1:31:21] we got he showed himself to us
[1:31:25] so that we could see who he was so that
[1:31:28] we could see still here so we didn't get
[1:31:31] caught up in this world which is
[1:31:34] revolving into chaos and evolving as it
[1:31:37] does down into hell he says the next
[1:31:43] time he reveals himself it'll be in
[1:31:44] judgment on the world and the Nations
[1:31:47] has forgot God send away their day of
[1:31:49] grace because they have forgotten God
[1:31:51] and they're doing the same thing that
[1:31:53] they did to the angel of the Lord back
[1:31:55] there mocking and making fun of it but
[1:31:58] he's here now in mercy
[1:31:59] look we understand that today it's not
[1:32:04] up to me as well I just I've done so
[1:32:07] much now I just can't believe the
[1:32:08] message anymore because I know he
[1:32:10] revealed himself at mercy if there's any
[1:32:13] mercy to you it all comes from this
[1:32:14] message he said my life's been messed up
[1:32:17] I've been married two three times I've
[1:32:18] had all these problems but if he didn't
[1:32:20] come in this message to show you what
[1:32:22] the truth was that was mercy to you that
[1:32:25] was Christ he wanted to show you what
[1:32:27] you've done wrong and pound you over the
[1:32:28] head with it but it was grace to you it
[1:32:31] was great to me your sister just a
[1:32:33] certain way you think well I just can't
[1:32:35] keep doing that it just it's not in my
[1:32:36] heart listen it was mercy if you ever
[1:32:39] really understand it was Marcy was
[1:32:42] Christ here by heart today Church I want
[1:32:51] you to hear my heart God deals with the
[1:32:52] heart he doesn't do what the head he
[1:32:55] deals with the heart in my heart today
[1:32:57] we need this message God still needs
[1:33:00] preachers preaching this message why
[1:33:03] because that's what a prophet restored
[1:33:04] to us he will come in judgment upon the
[1:33:12] nation's and while he's being revealed
[1:33:14] in mercy
[1:33:16] while he's being revealed in my fury he
[1:33:19] says hurry hither run quickly children
[1:33:23] get away from these man-made Babylonian
[1:33:26] theological walls of unbelief and cold
[1:33:29] formalism run away from man-made
[1:33:31] theology get out in the middle of the
[1:33:35] field in cost grace
[1:33:42] over here in the middle of the field and
[1:34:21] away from this get away from me hey men
[1:34:55] the man who says he looked at me like if
[1:34:57] a man had any kind of spirituality about
[1:35:00] him of the Spirit of God in him when
[1:35:03] he's seen the Lord Jesus - just what he
[1:35:05] said he would do it would throw this
[1:35:06] heart in such a way that he couldn't
[1:35:08] hold his peace any longer you wanna know
[1:35:12] why I preach this why a man he said that
[1:35:16] you threw his heart in such a way when
[1:35:18] he seen God do what he said he would do
[1:35:20] he would throw his heart in such a way
[1:35:21] that he couldn't hold his peace in your
[1:35:23] hunger he would set the nation of fire
[1:35:25] with the message he said as it was in
[1:35:27] them days so will it be the message went
[1:35:30] forth and they merely laughed and mocked
[1:35:33] devil if someone who was telling some
[1:35:35] kind of an idle tale and that's what
[1:35:37] they do today when we tell them God said
[1:35:39] prophet God sent a messenger and God has
[1:35:41] a message today God has a people God has
[1:35:44] a bride they laugh at it they make
[1:35:45] relevant they called it some kind of an
[1:35:47] idle tale but it was a mercy and it was
[1:35:50] a grace it was a deliverance said did
[1:35:55] you notice what the angel said I can't
[1:35:57] do nothing do you come here there what
[1:35:58] was it it was a message of deliverance
[1:36:00] before one speck of fire could fall from
[1:36:03] heaven a lot had to get out of Sodom
[1:36:04] before one drop of rain fell from heaven
[1:36:07] Noah when is the art but the robber says
[1:36:09] it this way in crashes the mystery of
[1:36:10] God revealed he said before they shut us
[1:36:12] up we'll go up before one gospel fell
[1:36:17] from heaven
[1:36:17] Noah know the art before the atom bomb
[1:36:19] can strike this nation the church will
[1:36:21] go in the rapture to meet the Lord Jesus
[1:36:22] and if the sputnik's and the missiles
[1:36:25] were sent and the hammers will pull back
[1:36:26] the Angels are all standing in order the
[1:36:30] great corridors of heaven is crowded
[1:36:31] full the hopes are all in tune the great
[1:36:33] bands already practiced up there's a
[1:36:35] homecoming time pretty soon for the
[1:36:37] Church of the Living God he's been
[1:36:39] waiting is coming everything is in order
[1:36:42] I'm so glad he said I'm getting so tired
[1:36:44] oh for that great hour in the body of
[1:37:08] Christ the church in this time the Bride
[1:37:10] of Christ during this Junction time
[1:37:12] remember so shall it be in the coming of
[1:37:16] the Son of man when the Son of Man is
[1:37:18] being revealed from heaven brother
[1:37:23] branham take sent it to a different
[1:37:24] place then the world takes it because
[1:37:27] they take it to the Sodom condition and
[1:37:29] whether Brown does talk about that but
[1:37:31] he takes it beyond the Sodom condition
[1:37:33] he said during that time the secrets of
[1:37:36] the hearts were being revealed to a
[1:37:39] elect group and we get discouraged when
[1:37:44] we just look out at the Sodom condition
[1:37:46] as I said anybody can tell us the end
[1:37:48] time looking at the Sodom condition but
[1:37:51] if you could only look and see what God
[1:37:52] did he said but God did that 50 years
[1:37:57] ago 60 years ago yes he did
[1:37:58] but he's doing it today you don't have
[1:38:02] to send that prophet again to discern
[1:38:03] the hearts but the Lord is a discerner
[1:38:05] of the thoughts and intents of the heart
[1:38:07] and I have confidence that if I preach
[1:38:09] this message that people will be saved I
[1:38:11] have confidence when I preach this
[1:38:12] message the bride will be healed
[1:38:14] probably free the bride will come to
[1:38:16] their place why because this message is
[1:38:18] what I needed and it's what you needed
[1:38:21] it met the need that was called for in
[1:38:24] this hour they bed there was materials
[1:38:30] hidden in the earth for thousands of
[1:38:31] years nobody found a use for but then
[1:38:33] all of a sudden they begin to make
[1:38:35] devices that required certain materials
[1:38:39] and when they did all the sudden they
[1:38:41] needed that and it becomes valuable what
[1:38:44] was worthless become valuable why
[1:38:46] because it was needed during our time
[1:38:48] and the things written in the scripture
[1:38:51] the theologians thought might have been
[1:38:53] worthless God and this time brought them
[1:38:55] why we needed so I function and device
[1:38:57] in this time to be able to connect to
[1:38:59] heaven the son of man when that day when
[1:39:03] the Son of Man has been revealed from
[1:39:04] heaven that's will be like the days of
[1:39:06] lot that's a day that we live in we have
[1:39:09] the message but it's not enough just to
[1:39:12] hear it even to realize that you need it
[1:39:18] you could go I've been lately every time
[1:39:22] I go in a store saying I need a riding
[1:39:23] lawnmower and Peter has been reminding
[1:39:28] me every day I don't want a riding
[1:39:31] lawnmower I'll get my own lawnmower I'm
[1:39:33] just saying this the he Peter's been
[1:39:37] remind me that cuz he's the one that's
[1:39:38] the Mohawk the time or more as you can
[1:39:42] say as you can see I don't know much but
[1:39:44] we have a big yard now and a big yard
[1:39:46] where we're moving and so Peters he's
[1:39:49] getting concerned about that he's saying
[1:39:53] Debbie that'll take me all for months
[1:39:56] and it'll Harvey yard looks so good here
[1:39:58] he'd been mowing the yard and I thank
[1:39:59] you for that but the Harvey but you've
[1:40:01] been helping us out doing that and I
[1:40:02] told Peter I said well you could help
[1:40:04] with Harvey come up here mow and he just
[1:40:05] about died
[1:40:07] because he's got to push him over but
[1:40:09] it's self-propelled when I was a kid I
[1:40:10] didn't have us help propel push mower
[1:40:12] it's self-propelled forgive me for
[1:40:15] picking on you this morning beater bit
[1:40:16] but you know he's getting anxious every
[1:40:18] time we go in the store we need to look
[1:40:20] at the riding lawnmowers but it doesn't
[1:40:23] do me any good unless I buy it we can
[1:40:27] talk about it we can acknowledge our
[1:40:30] need for it but until I buy it he's got
[1:40:33] a push are you with me now you can talk
[1:40:38] about the message you can acknowledge
[1:40:40] your need for it you can say I did would
[1:40:42] really help my family to be in a church
[1:40:44] and to be believed the message in and to
[1:40:46] have all these things that to have the
[1:40:48] church said in order would really help
[1:40:49] but don't do any good unless you take
[1:40:51] advantage of it it doesn't do you a bit
[1:40:53] of good to empathize with it or
[1:40:55] sympathize with it unless you're willing
[1:40:57] to come under it and no matter what
[1:40:59] happens in your life to say lord I
[1:41:01] messed up but I'm coming under your
[1:41:02] message I'm coming under the word if I
[1:41:05] have to repent whatever I have to do I'm
[1:41:07] coming under the word and then we have
[1:41:08] fellowship under that word under that
[1:41:10] blood hey man let's bow our heads
[1:41:12] together this message is a message of
[1:41:17] mercy if you haven't responded to that
[1:41:22] message of mercy would you do that today
[1:41:25] would you do that today I believe it
[1:41:29] takes a moment's time if you haven't
[1:41:33] really dedicated yourself to the message
[1:41:35] and come under that token really let
[1:41:38] your life be cleansed by the Holy Spirit
[1:41:40] would you just do that today would you
[1:41:42] start that journey you've never been
[1:41:44] baptized would be glad to do that for
[1:41:46] you if you've not responded would you do
[1:41:50] that if you have if you have responded
[1:41:52] would you just take a moment this
[1:41:54] morning
[1:41:55] and recognize what the message means to
[1:41:57] your life too many times we look at it
[1:42:01] and we present it to our children as a
[1:42:03] hindrance to our lives oh we can't do
[1:42:05] that because the message says that we
[1:42:07] can't we can't do that because brother
[1:42:09] branham said
[1:42:11] no we we believe the Word of God was
[1:42:14] revealed in our day we don't do those
[1:42:16] things because we believe we want to
[1:42:19] please God we love him with all of her
[1:42:22] heart we believe that it wasn't just
[1:42:24] because brother Branham said it but
[1:42:25] because God revealed it to our age
[1:42:27] through a prophet would you just talk to
[1:42:31] the Lord for a moment if you've never
[1:42:32] received the token never really believed
[1:42:36] you never had that change of life or if
[1:42:38] you've never if you just lightly haven't
[1:42:41] thought about what the message does for
[1:42:44] you would you do that bring yourself
[1:42:46] under that token make sure that the
[1:42:48] token is on display in your life I'll
[1:42:51] bless you for that Heavenly Father we
[1:42:55] thank you for your word today Lord Jesus
[1:42:59] how we needed this message or now is
[1:43:03] raid bad about about how this message
[1:43:05] was the message of mercy just made me
[1:43:07] want to run all over the church because
[1:43:10] I realized sword that I couldn't make it
[1:43:11] without your mercy without your blood
[1:43:16] and because of what you did on the cross
[1:43:19] because of what you've done in our day
[1:43:21] I fought by completing that redemption
[1:43:24] by opening the book to us with Lord we
[1:43:28] wait for the fulfillment of it in our
[1:43:29] bodies Lord has been our souls in the
[1:43:33] hell a seal of God
[1:43:35] we thank you for it we ask you Lord that
[1:43:38] we would we would change our thoughts
[1:43:40] Lord perhaps about this message of what
[1:43:42] it means to us we we are not ashamed of
[1:43:44] this message we believe in the right way
[1:43:47] sometimes we get ashamed of those who
[1:43:49] misuse it
[1:43:51] who abuser to make a cult out of it but
[1:43:54] Lord we we were sent a message for a
[1:43:56] reason and of course the devil would try
[1:43:58] to come and try to make something out of
[1:44:00] it that it's not Lord we want to stay
[1:44:03] right in the middle of your grace let
[1:44:06] others do what they want to hard but as
[1:44:08] a church we want to stay away from those
[1:44:10] denominational walls
[1:44:12] let's stay right in the middle of your
[1:44:14] grace help us Lord help me Lord to stay
[1:44:18] right where I should be
[1:44:20] Oh God help me not to get to the place
[1:44:23] where I become what I despise what a hey
[1:44:25] Lord you really dealt with me about that
[1:44:27] Oh God help us Lord that we could remain
[1:44:30] in the middle where we can be God's
[1:44:32] mercy we could be a source of mercy
[1:44:35] because we believe this message because
[1:44:37] we've been changed by it I don't know
[1:44:40] just to believe it or just to
[1:44:42] acknowledge it but to be changed by if
[1:44:43] we really believe we'll accept it will
[1:44:45] come under it will be changed by it
[1:44:47] I pray you grant it now you sent this
[1:44:51] message because there was a
[1:44:52] predestinated seed that could receive it
[1:44:54] or we're thankful that we have that seed
[1:44:57] within us to receive it and we know that
[1:44:59] there are others we pray lord you'd help
[1:45:01] us reach that last seed so we can go
