[45:03] I don't want to uh want to sound like I
[45:06] you know I love to do it I love to
[45:07] preach and uh but sometimes I need some
[45:10] time to collect my thoughts so I think
[45:12] he's going to be in so it'll give me a
[45:13] week to where I can come back and be
[45:15] ready to preach now we're um we'll be
[45:18] here though we got that fall festival
[45:20] coming up on on Saturday so I'm sure
[45:23] you're looking forward to that and then
[45:25] one service is here on Sunday brother
[45:27] Gabe happy birthday seems like uh you're
[45:30] always running late on your birthday
[45:32] always things happening and it's good to
[45:35] have brother Gabe with us tonight and
[45:37] all of you that are here I know there's
[45:38] several that are sick and um tonight not
[45:42] able to come I talked to brother JT
[45:43] today and he's doing as well as could be
[45:45] expected with the procedure that he had
[45:47] but keep him in your prayers Revelation
[45:49] 8 And1 let's uh deal with the seventh
[45:52] seal we need open the seventh seal there
[45:56] was silence in heaven about the space of
[45:59] half an hour well it don't give us much
[46:02] does it there's so much there pray the
[46:04] Lord would add his Blessing to the word
[46:06] you may be
[46:08] seated this will probably be several
[46:11] parts so if you feel I'm leaving
[46:12] something out I probably
[46:14] am and uh I've tried not to go back and
[46:17] and and find what other men have taught
[46:21] uh as far as around the message on this
[46:23] I've tried to just stay right with the
[46:24] scripture and We Believe brother brandom
[46:26] taught about the seventh seal and uh so
[46:29] if you disagree with me tonight just
[46:31] spit that out and and uh keep on eating
[46:34] pie and we'll we'll agree on something
[46:36] I'll say this if you disagree with the
[46:38] message I know sometimes we try to
[46:40] witness to people and it seems like
[46:42] we're trying to push it on them that's
[46:43] not it at all we care about it because
[46:46] we believe it's true but if we uh if you
[46:49] disagree with that you just go live a
[46:51] Christian Life and do the very best that
[46:53] you can and get ready for the coming of
[46:55] the Lord because I think we can all
[46:56] agree we're in the end time and and and
[46:59] the Lord is coming how many believe that
[47:01] tonight and uh so we need to be ready
[47:03] for that in whatever way that we can and
[47:06] I believe we just try to live as close
[47:07] to the word as we can live I want to
[47:10] take this uh from the message of the
[47:12] hour I want to take a stand for what a
[47:15] prophet taught on these things and when
[47:18] there's so much confusion all around we
[47:20] don't want to misunderstand but we want
[47:22] to uh find out exactly what a prophet
[47:24] taught about these things now when you
[47:28] when you think about silence in heaven
[47:30] that's a big
[47:31] deal because since Elohim began creation
[47:36] there's never been silence in heaven
[47:39] heaven is Perpetual
[47:43] worship Perpetual worship I'll say this
[47:47] if you don't like Worship in church you
[47:50] aren't going to enjoy Heaven at
[47:52] all because heaven is Perpetual worship
[47:56] it's I it's constantly worship around
[47:59] the Throne of God and and and brother
[48:02] brandham talked about this breaking of
[48:04] the seal being so great that heaven was
[48:07] hushed by it that it was in silence for
[48:10] the space of a half hour it was Hush
[48:13] there wasn't a thing moved for a half
[48:15] hour now I tell you what now someone
[48:18] said that this is actually what this
[48:20] means is there won't be any women in
[48:22] heaven but I don't agree with
[48:24] that there was a half hour of Silence I
[48:27] don't agree with that at all actually
[48:29] Joel might be
[48:33] suspect if it was a half hour of literal
[48:36] silence but but it was something
[48:39] happened something so great that heaven
[48:42] was hushed for half an hour a and a half
[48:46] hour might not seem long if you're
[48:48] having a good time but in the suspense
[48:51] between death and life it seemed like a
[48:54] millennium the 4 and 20 Elders that
[48:56] stood before God that the Bible says
[48:58] were harping with their Harps they quit
[49:01] playing their Harps the Angels hushed
[49:03] they're singing if you go back to Isaiah
[49:05] chapter 6 you'll find that the cherubims
[49:08] flew around and they constantly flew and
[49:11] they they cried holy holy holy is the
[49:15] Lord God Almighty constantly they cried
[49:17] that out and the the even the doors the
[49:20] posts of the temple moved when they
[49:22] cried and that stopped everything thing
[49:26] stopped at the opening of the seventh
[49:29] seal so all of Heaven There was deadly
[49:33] silence in heaven no Praises no Altra
[49:36] service for a half hour so all the host
[49:40] of Heaven Was silent for this when this
[49:43] seventh seal mystery in the book of
[49:44] redemption was broke open but it's broke
[49:48] the lamb breaks it he said you know what
[49:51] they were AED by it I believe they
[49:53] didn't know there it was they just stop
[49:55] what is it now none of us know he said
[49:58] but I'm going to tell you my revelation
[50:00] of it now this is something that would
[50:03] not be announced it would just happen
[50:06] and then we would see what it was so
[50:09] it's not something that would come out
[50:11] and and they'd say this is what's coming
[50:14] but it's something that would happen and
[50:16] then we would I will say this the part
[50:19] of it uh we're talking about the coming
[50:21] of the Lord tonight and and how we get
[50:23] ready for that now the part of it
[50:25] there's part of it we don't know what is
[50:27] that the part that we don't know today
[50:29] is the day and hour of his coming we
[50:31] don't know what day and if somebody
[50:33] tells you they do know they're
[50:35] wrong right because the Bible said no
[50:38] man knows the day or the hour only the
[50:40] Father in heaven and so we have to uh
[50:43] believe that tonight and so we don't
[50:45] know we just want to be ready but we do
[50:48] know that we see signs all around us and
[50:50] and we see that the times are here we
[50:53] believe that this is the end time time
[50:55] now this is something that again it
[50:58] would not be announced it would just
[50:59] happen and then we would see what it was
[51:01] are you with me so far tonight now we
[51:04] know and and we believe that it's the
[51:06] seventh angel messenger of Revelation
[51:08] 10:7 it's his job to finish the mystery
[51:11] of God Revelation 10:7 in the days of
[51:13] the voice of the seventh angel when he
[51:16] shall begin to sound the mystery of God
[51:18] should be finished Heath declared to his
[51:21] servants the prophets so all that God
[51:23] wanted to do all of his Plan of
[51:26] Redemption everything uh that he had
[51:28] planned to do with the Jewish church
[51:30] with the Gentile Church all the
[51:32] mysteries of the Kingdom would be uh
[51:35] would be revealed or would be finished
[51:38] at that time and it had to be at the end
[51:40] time that that would happen we'll get to
[51:42] that after a while now we believe that
[51:45] that that was brother William Marian
[51:47] brandham that that was the man that God
[51:49] used he was the Earthly messenger that
[51:51] God sent at the end time to fulfill this
[51:54] scripture also Malachi 45 and6 and Luke
[51:58] 173 or 30 that his message would forerun
[52:02] the coming of Christ we know that this
[52:05] book contains the entire mystery of God
[52:08] how many believe that tonight everything
[52:10] that God uh wanted to be made known
[52:13] everything God wanted to God breathed
[52:16] the prophet spoke it by inspiration they
[52:18] wrote it down and this book is the
[52:20] inherent word of God this is the Bible
[52:24] if you can't tell what it is the Bible
[52:26] is the inherent uh completely accurate
[52:30] word of God yet many people have many
[52:33] different ideas about what the Bible is
[52:36] so we know that there's many different
[52:38] theories about the Bible and what the
[52:40] Bible is and what it does and and so the
[52:44] book is sealed in some sense that you
[52:47] could look in the Bible and people
[52:48] become all kinds of denomination they
[52:51] become all kind have all kinds of views
[52:53] all kinds of ideas but the Bible is
[52:55] still
[52:56] true right and and we learn many things
[52:59] about it by studying it but we know uh
[53:02] that many people even who study the book
[53:04] disagree about what it is so there's got
[53:06] to be something uh that comes to us that
[53:08] tells us what the truth is now what is
[53:11] that it's Revelation right it's God
[53:13] revealing To Us by the Holy Spirit who
[53:15] was his teacher and telling us these
[53:18] things that would come now uh there's no
[53:21] other book that we use other than the
[53:23] Bible to contain the mystery of God the
[53:26] mysteries of the Kingdom what's going to
[53:27] happen at the end time it's all in the
[53:30] scripture if it doesn't have its
[53:32] foundation in the scripture then it
[53:34] isn't true right because we believe that
[53:37] the scripture is the entire word of God
[53:40] now uh and but the scripture had
[53:43] Mysteries and that's what in Revelation
[53:45] chapter 5 there's a lamb uh there
[53:48] there's a book and that book I believe
[53:50] is the Bible it's the book of redemption
[53:52] uh it's a book you could say a book of
[53:54] names it's our identity it's who we are
[53:57] it's our Redemption it's the Plan of
[53:59] Redemption uh but it's actually the
[54:01] scriptures that were sealed up with
[54:04] Seven Seals and the lamb no one was
[54:07] found worthy to open the book but aren't
[54:08] you glad that the lamb is worthy the
[54:11] lamb was found worthy to open the book
[54:13] and to loose the seals thereof and so he
[54:16] goes down and he begins to open up the
[54:18] book and and he opened Seven Seals one
[54:21] at a time one through seven now when he
[54:25] opened those seals it it brought a
[54:27] mystery it released a mystery and what
[54:30] was that it was a white horse rider a
[54:32] red horse rider a black horse rider a
[54:35] pale horse rider you could have many
[54:37] different ideas of what that was but he
[54:39] said at the end time that during the
[54:41] days of the seventh angel message that
[54:43] that would be revealed
[54:44] now uh God is going to do something he's
[54:49] going to he's going to tell us what he
[54:51] wants to do in this hour well I'm so
[54:53] glad that he did
[54:56] so God is making it so real now brother
[54:58] brandham was was told by the Holy Spirit
[55:01] to go to Tucson he was told uh to go
[55:04] west and God was making it look re so
[55:07] real to him uh and when he was out west
[55:10] he saw the seven angels which formed a
[55:13] cloud and then it was later a picture
[55:15] taken a sign in the heavens that showed
[55:18] us that Christ was in that cloud and and
[55:22] he saw seven angels which uh uh which
[55:25] actually were uh gave him the mysteries
[55:28] of the seals which revealed that to him
[55:30] now uh the seven angels brought forth
[55:33] the winding up of all the scriptures
[55:36] because all the mysteries of the entire
[55:37] Bible lay in the Seven Seals we know
[55:41] that's the book it's sealed with that
[55:42] even out it's the mystery of the entire
[55:45] book laid in those Seven Seals or let us
[55:47] bring so we believe I'm just going to
[55:50] clue you in on this I believe I don't
[55:53] want to speak for all of you but I think
[55:54] many of you do as well that the seven
[55:56] steel book has been opened and that
[55:59] we're now living in the time when it's
[56:02] our job to consume that and go prophesy
[56:05] again and to the earth now the Seven
[56:08] Seals were open opened up the entire
[56:11] Bible the Seven Seals was seal with
[56:14] seven Mysteries and in these Seven Seals
[56:16] held the entire mystery of it it was the
[56:19] book of redemption New Testament and if
[56:22] this is a little bit deep for you
[56:24] tonight just think about it pray about
[56:26] it like I said you may disagree with me
[56:28] but uh but just just pray about it
[56:30] because I believe it's something that's
[56:32] true now uh the message of the Seven
[56:35] Seals and they're closing brandom says
[56:38] that's the message of the entire Bible
[56:41] so we could say it opens it up but it
[56:43] also closes up the Seven Seals closes
[56:46] the New Testament sealed it up in other
[56:47] words it's it's all of it so that's all
[56:51] that there is
[56:52] now the the angel told Brother brother
[56:55] bandam that the Seven Seals of the
[56:56] Hidden Mysteries of the entire Bible
[56:58] will be open and fulfill Revelation
[57:00] 10 excuse me that in the seventh Angel's
[57:03] message these things should come to pass
[57:06] this day this scripture is fulfilled
[57:08] before our eyes I'm so glad a prophet
[57:10] could stand up there and say that this
[57:12] day this scripture is fulfilled
[57:15] somebody's got to say that now where do
[57:16] we take that from Jesus standing before
[57:18] the uh in the synagogue and reading in
[57:21] Isaiah where he talked about uh the Lord
[57:23] has anointed me to preach
[57:25] uh Glad Tidings and all of these things
[57:27] he said this day this scripture is
[57:29] fulfilled and a prophet of God came and
[57:32] preached that same thing now these are
[57:35] there were words in the scripture that
[57:37] were to be sealed up till the time of
[57:39] the end Daniel 12:9 I I know this is
[57:41] Elementary but I'm laying a foundation
[57:43] and when when the time comes tonight
[57:45] when it's my time to quit I'll just quit
[57:47] and we'll continue the next time we're
[57:49] here now uh he these words were to be
[57:51] sealed up to the time of the end and he
[57:54] and Daniel 12:9 we find that he said go
[57:56] thy Way Daniel for the words are closed
[57:59] up and sealed till when till the time of
[58:02] the end well that's where we're at a
[58:06] time of the end
[58:07] now again brother brandom speaking said
[58:10] where are we in this abrahamic age where
[58:13] are we in this great time we're standing
[58:14] the great hour we're living in he said
[58:17] all the Visions has been fulfilled yes
[58:20] oh I like that all the Visions has been
[58:23] fulfilled now he's saying this in uh uh
[58:26] in 1965 all the Visions have been
[58:30] fulfilled he told about a dream that
[58:33] Junior Jackson had he talked about that
[58:35] dream and we'll get maybe in another
[58:37] service we'll get into that but he he
[58:40] talked about that and he said I stood
[58:41] there a little bit till the Holy Spirit
[58:43] revealed it I said the entire Bible as
[58:45] much has been revealed to man through
[58:47] justification sanctification baptism of
[58:49] the Holy Ghost baptism in Jesus name all
[58:51] these things has been revealed but
[58:53] there's secrets that hid in side because
[58:55] the Bible is sealed with Seven Seals he
[58:57] said I must go there to find it and and
[59:00] so here comes the uh those seven angels
[59:03] that come down and and uh he said return
[59:06] back to Jeffersonville from where you
[59:07] come from he said for the Seven Seals of
[59:09] the seven Mysteries will be opened and
[59:13] and he goes on he said here we are today
[59:14] understanding serpent seed uh in a few
[59:17] days he said we understand the
[59:18] correctness of marriage and divorce all
[59:19] these things that God Us open every
[59:22] seal we we could just stop there every
[59:24] seal yeah mystery since the foundation
[59:27] of the world and we've been enjoy the
[59:29] presence of His blessings yes that's
[59:31] true this day this
[59:34] scripture so every Seal's been open yeah
[59:37] the mystery since the foundation of the
[59:39] world so and so I want us to look at at
[59:43] the opening of the seals as not uh seven
[59:47] sermons that are preached in
[59:49] Jeffersonville but something that opened
[59:51] up every sealed mystery of the entire
[59:55] book yeah and so brother brandom talked
[59:58] about how since the opening of The Seven
[1:00:00] Seals that this has become a new book
[1:00:02] not because anybody wrote anything new
[1:00:04] in it but Revelation had come he said
[1:00:06] the things that's been hid is being
[1:00:08] revealed as God promised in Revelation
[1:00:10] 10 he would do it and we are the
[1:00:12] privileged people that God has chosen of
[1:00:14] the earth we might see and understand
[1:00:16] these things which is not some mythical
[1:00:18] fleshly Mind of a person trying to make
[1:00:19] it up it's the word of God made manifest
[1:00:22] proven that it's right are you with me
[1:00:24] so far I know it's a lot of reading
[1:00:26] tonight it's I'm trying to uh uh trying
[1:00:28] to teach what brother brandom taught
[1:00:30] about the seventh seal so you're just
[1:00:32] going to have to pinch yourself to stay
[1:00:33] awake but I trust it'll be a blessing to
[1:00:35] you now so we're the privileged people
[1:00:39] proven uh not by science but by God that
[1:00:42] it's right yeah he said God as I've said
[1:00:44] before in a message God doesn't need
[1:00:46] anyone to interpret his word this and
[1:00:48] I've hammered this point but it's so
[1:00:50] true that God does his own interpreting
[1:00:53] and ultim whatever it is that we believe
[1:00:56] has to be interpreted by God all right
[1:00:59] and and the Rapture itself will be the
[1:01:01] final showdown like if if we leave here
[1:01:04] we're right right yeah does that make
[1:01:07] sense and if that's just that's just the
[1:01:10] way it is it's a final showdown there'll
[1:01:12] come a day we'll leave here and that
[1:01:14] that will prove uh that that that we
[1:01:16] were right and I trust that we are right
[1:01:18] I wouldn't stand up here and uh there's
[1:01:20] other things I could do I don't I
[1:01:22] wouldn't stand up here and preach if I
[1:01:23] didn't feel like we had the truth and we
[1:01:25] believe the truth and yet many other
[1:01:27] people believe they have the truth I say
[1:01:29] Seek it with all of your heart look for
[1:01:32] it with all of your heart but for me and
[1:01:34] for my house this is what God Said in
[1:01:36] our day so we find that uh God
[1:01:39] interprets his own word by bringing it
[1:01:41] to pass yes he interprets his word to us
[1:01:45] by that's the way he does with salvation
[1:01:48] is that right he interprets salvation To
[1:01:50] Us by saving us yeah right you could say
[1:01:54] that it's you know some people say well
[1:01:56] you go shake hands with the preacher
[1:01:58] others say you speak in tongues others
[1:02:00] say you do all sorts of things but how
[1:02:02] does he interpret salvation To Us by
[1:02:05] saving us yes and we realize that uh
[1:02:08] that that we are uh we're changed and
[1:02:10] our life has been changed we're
[1:02:12] different than what we used to be how
[1:02:14] many can say that's happened in your
[1:02:15] life that your life has completely
[1:02:17] changed from what it was what he has
[1:02:19] made it so what is that God interpreting
[1:02:21] his own word he promised to do it and
[1:02:24] then he did it in your life right well
[1:02:26] don't you think these end time events
[1:02:28] will be the same thing God interprets
[1:02:31] his word by bringing it to pass so
[1:02:34] somebody has a theory that doesn't come
[1:02:36] to pass and that theory is not the word
[1:02:38] of God it can't be because God's words
[1:02:40] are yay and amen they're always true do
[1:02:43] you believe that yes they're always true
[1:02:46] now God can't lie I'm glad I'm glad of
[1:02:50] that I I'm I rest in that yes because
[1:02:54] everything else can fall away but God
[1:02:56] can't lie he said I'm his child he can't
[1:03:00] lie he said if I would come to him if I
[1:03:02] believe on the Lord Jesus Christ that me
[1:03:05] and my house would be saved and I
[1:03:06] believed and he's not a liar amen that's
[1:03:09] simple isn't it but that's the truth
[1:03:13] yes so now brother brandom and and I'm
[1:03:17] just going to drop some things in
[1:03:18] tonight and then you chew on them for a
[1:03:20] couple weeks and we'll come back and and
[1:03:23] and maybe we'll go into more depth than
[1:03:25] each thing now brother brandom talks
[1:03:28] about uh in a sermon called exist the
[1:03:30] sign of the end sir brother Brandon tied
[1:03:33] Revelation 10
[1:03:35] 1:7 and and the revealing of the seven
[1:03:38] Thunders where it said there were seven
[1:03:39] Thunders that uttered their voice and
[1:03:41] John was about to write he said seal it
[1:03:43] up don't write it uh but in the days of
[1:03:46] the voice of the seventh angel the
[1:03:47] mystery of God will be finish so he ties
[1:03:50] that to his
[1:03:51] ministry and and then if you fast
[1:03:54] forward 3 years to
[1:03:56] 1965 he says three years ago this
[1:03:59] mystery was a prophecy what time is it
[1:04:01] sir now it's history it's past so
[1:04:05] whatever he preach in is this a sign of
[1:04:07] the end sir this is important if you
[1:04:09] believe the message of the hour it's
[1:04:11] important to understand this whatever he
[1:04:12] preached in this the sign of the in sir
[1:04:15] is going to be uh come to pass by the
[1:04:18] time he preaches uh by the time he
[1:04:21] preaches what is the attraction on the
[1:04:22] mountain right it now and again I
[1:04:25] believe it was his job to reveal it and
[1:04:28] many of you do now we know uh we know it
[1:04:31] that was his job to do it and yet
[1:04:33] there's some controversy and it seems
[1:04:35] like a big secret surrounding the
[1:04:38] seventh seal and if you go into the
[1:04:40] seventh seal sermon the Bible doesn't
[1:04:42] say that much about it Jesus when he
[1:04:44] talks about the end time events in
[1:04:45] Matthew 24 he goes in he parallels six
[1:04:49] of the seals but when it comes time for
[1:04:51] the seventh seal there's nothing said
[1:04:52] about it yeah right he just it says
[1:04:54] learn a parable of the Fig Tree yeah
[1:04:56] which we know it's a Jewish nation that
[1:04:58] that begins to Bud and come back as
[1:05:00] we're seeing today the things that are
[1:05:02] going on there but it's a time of uh the
[1:05:06] seventh
[1:05:07] seal just a it's an hour and a half into
[1:05:10] the sermon when he begins to talk
[1:05:12] actually about the seal and he he begins
[1:05:15] to tell us about it but he does tell us
[1:05:17] several things about it he tells us and
[1:05:20] I think the scripture Bears this out the
[1:05:22] seventh seal is the end of all things
[1:05:25] yeah the seventh seal is the end of all
[1:05:28] things right seven is complete it's over
[1:05:31] yeah amen I love that he said the seven
[1:05:35] SE is the end of time it's the end of
[1:05:37] all things someone say all things the
[1:05:40] things written in the seven seal book
[1:05:42] sealed up of the Plan of Redemption
[1:05:45] before the foundation of the world it
[1:05:46] every bit ends it is the end it's the
[1:05:49] end of strug the struggling world it's
[1:05:52] the end of struggling nature the end end
[1:05:54] of everything and there's the end of the
[1:05:55] trumpets the end of the vials it's the
[1:05:57] end of the Earth it's even the end of
[1:06:00] time and you find that in Revelation 105
[1:06:02] where he says there should be time no
[1:06:04] longer everything runs out in this time
[1:06:08] at the end of the seventh seal it's the
[1:06:10] end of the church age it's the end of
[1:06:12] the seventh seal it's the end of the
[1:06:14] trumpets it's the end of the vials even
[1:06:16] in the ushering in of the Millennium is
[1:06:18] the seventh seal now brother brand said
[1:06:19] it was like a rocket that fires off and
[1:06:22] if you've looked at fireworks
[1:06:24] if you get the good ones you know i'
[1:06:26] I've got some actually in somewhere in
[1:06:29] my closet I've got some good fireworks
[1:06:31] that we didn't get to shoot off this
[1:06:32] year we didn't think our neighbors would
[1:06:34] appreciate it but I've got some good
[1:06:36] ones if you get the good ones the
[1:06:38] fireworks actually uh they'll go off
[1:06:42] right and then it'll there'll be an
[1:06:43] explosion and then there'll be several
[1:06:46] go off of that right and then it'll
[1:06:48] explode again and there'll be several go
[1:06:50] off of that so brother brandom taught us
[1:06:52] that the seven seal
[1:06:54] was a an explosion it was a it was an
[1:06:57] unveiling of a mystery but then off of
[1:07:00] that over here there's there's part of
[1:07:01] it over here there's part of it it's the
[1:07:04] end of this it's the end of that it's
[1:07:06] the end of all things right wrapped up
[1:07:09] in the seventh seal so you can talk
[1:07:11] about the seventh seal a long time and
[1:07:13] see part of it and not see all of it
[1:07:15] because it's just the coming of the lord
[1:07:17] it's just the end of everything so uh
[1:07:21] now he said now how is he going to do it
[1:07:23] he said that's what we don't know yeah
[1:07:26] how he's going to do it he said we don't
[1:07:28] know and that was at the time of the
[1:07:30] seven seal now so it's the end of all
[1:07:32] things he tells us that the seventh seal
[1:07:34] is the seven Thunders that's the
[1:07:36] remember it's a moment of it's a time of
[1:07:38] Silence seven Thunders were uh uh
[1:07:41] something that could not be understood
[1:07:44] and so he says I this one I will speak
[1:07:46] that is the mystery of the seven
[1:07:48] Thunders the seven thunders in heaven
[1:07:50] will unfold this mystery and if you
[1:07:52] wonder about the thunder brother
[1:07:54] brandham taught us that he that one of
[1:07:57] the jobs of the seventh angel messenger
[1:07:59] is to reveal the mysteries of the seven
[1:08:00] Thunders Revelation 10 which are the
[1:08:03] revelations contained in the Seven Seals
[1:08:05] I know this is a lot but just hang with
[1:08:07] me tonight it will be those divinely
[1:08:09] revealed mystery truths that literally
[1:08:12] turn the hearts of the children to the
[1:08:13] Pentecostal fathers he's referencing
[1:08:16] Malachi 4 now so if uh the divinely
[1:08:19] revealed mystery truths turn the hearts
[1:08:21] of the children to the Pentecostal
[1:08:23] fathers
[1:08:24] then I I would leave you with this if
[1:08:26] the Seven Seals are not revealed it
[1:08:28] means the seven Thunders are not
[1:08:29] revealed which means that our hearts
[1:08:31] have not been turned back and we got to
[1:08:32] wait on that to
[1:08:34] happen so he also tells us the seventh
[1:08:37] seal is the third
[1:08:38] pole the seventh steel is the third poll
[1:08:41] now brother brandom again I've explained
[1:08:43] that to you the third poll of his
[1:08:45] ministry there's three polls to it the
[1:08:47] first poll was a healing campaign the
[1:08:49] second pole was a discernment to know
[1:08:51] the thoughts and intents of the heart
[1:08:53] and the the third poll was the uh the
[1:08:56] opening of the word is what he taught us
[1:08:58] now the third poll is actually uh during
[1:09:02] this this time was the greatest of the
[1:09:05] three but it was the one that got uh it
[1:09:07] was the one that was hidden it was
[1:09:08] something that couldn't be impersonated
[1:09:11] something that uh was not a public show
[1:09:14] and so he said the seven FS the third
[1:09:16] poll he he talked about the things that
[1:09:18] happen and and I'm trying to skip
[1:09:20] through here so I can get done on time
[1:09:22] he said he said there was three things
[1:09:24] that unfolded one unfolded today is one
[1:09:27] I can't interpret because it's an
[1:09:28] unknown language but I stand right there
[1:09:30] and look right straight at it he said
[1:09:32] and this is the third poll coming up he
[1:09:34] said that's the reason all heaven was
[1:09:35] silent remember the third pole was
[1:09:37] something that we wouldn't understand
[1:09:40] are you okay tonight you still with me
[1:09:43] you said brother Ben how in the world
[1:09:44] does all this apply to my
[1:09:46] life you're going home one of these days
[1:09:50] I'm going home one of these days this is
[1:09:51] not all there is there's a better
[1:09:54] there's a better place we're going to
[1:09:57] and we believe this this is how we get
[1:09:58] here so well how how do we get here by
[1:10:00] learning it no by by receiving the power
[1:10:04] the anointing of God the the the uh the
[1:10:07] Life of Christ within us so we can live
[1:10:09] it what does that look like I'm getting
[1:10:10] ahead of myself here but it looks like
[1:10:12] us walking every day it looks like us
[1:10:14] doing our job it looks like us but in
[1:10:16] that we're overcoming in that we've got
[1:10:19] a revelation that tells us who we are
[1:10:21] and where we are and what we're doing on
[1:10:22] the Earth and we're not fatalists we're
[1:10:24] not just here we're not just some kind
[1:10:26] of animal or something just going
[1:10:28] through the motions but we belong to
[1:10:30] somebody who's had this all planned out
[1:10:33] all down through time and he's actually
[1:10:35] taking care of us even down to today so
[1:10:38] we're manifesting the the seventh seal
[1:10:40] if we can say it that way we're
[1:10:42] manifesting the end times We're
[1:10:43] manifesting The Life of Christ in our
[1:10:45] own
[1:10:46] lives and it's way simpler than what we
[1:10:49] thought it was it's not some great
[1:10:51] campaign somewhere it's not some great
[1:10:54] uh uh some even a prophet coming back a
[1:10:57] prophet is com and gone but that's not
[1:10:58] what the seventh steel is about the
[1:11:00] seven steel is
[1:11:02] us the seven steel is the bride living
[1:11:05] out until the moment that the body
[1:11:07] change comes we will not all sleep but
[1:11:09] we will all be changed in a moment in
[1:11:11] the twinkling of an eye right oh I'm so
[1:11:14] grateful for that
[1:11:16] today
[1:11:18] now why heaven was
[1:11:21] silent I mean that's pretty simple isn't
[1:11:24] it it would be so quiet and so unnoticed
[1:11:28] you said but God doesn't work like that
[1:11:30] if God was doing something everybody
[1:11:31] would know it the Rapture will come and
[1:11:33] some people won't even know what
[1:11:35] happened Jesus said you'd come like a
[1:11:37] thief in the night many people on the
[1:11:39] Earth won't even know the Rapture took
[1:11:41] place until the tribulation period
[1:11:43] starts right then some will look back
[1:11:45] and say we missed it remember how is
[1:11:48] that scripturally remember when Elijah
[1:11:50] when John the Baptist come on the earth
[1:11:52] in the spirit and the power of Elijah
[1:11:54] and the disciples who should have known
[1:11:57] because some of them had been John's
[1:11:59] disciples and they should have known
[1:12:01] what had happened but they come to Jesus
[1:12:04] they said well if you're the Christ they
[1:12:06] said shouldn't Elijah have come first
[1:12:09] and Jesus said he already came and you
[1:12:10] didn't know it and they did to him what
[1:12:13] they were supposed to do but he said
[1:12:16] Elijah will come and reveal all things
[1:12:18] speaking of the Elijah at the end time
[1:12:20] but he said Elijah already came don't
[1:12:22] you realize that's exactly how the
[1:12:23] Rapture will take place that it'll
[1:12:26] happen in such a minority group you
[1:12:27] realize Jesus was born and Satan didn't
[1:12:30] even know it he was hidden from Satan
[1:12:33] because he tried to kill all the babies
[1:12:35] but he was warned and went down into
[1:12:36] Egypt and and Satan didn't even know
[1:12:38] where he was till he began his
[1:12:41] ministry amen that's why he began to
[1:12:43] tempt him and and he went to withstand
[1:12:45] the Temptation for our sake Satan didn't
[1:12:47] even know where he was oh my don't you
[1:12:50] realize that this bride is hidden under
[1:12:53] the m hisory of the seven seal were
[1:12:54] hidden under the message of the hour and
[1:12:57] it's not just something you understand
[1:12:59] it's something you live
[1:13:02] right are you with me so
[1:13:05] far so it's the Seven Seals the third
[1:13:08] pole see he said that's the reason it
[1:13:10] was not revealed he said no one should
[1:13:13] know about
[1:13:14] it why he couldn't say anything about it
[1:13:16] and the seventh seal it's also the
[1:13:18] coming of Christ that's ultimately what
[1:13:20] it
[1:13:21] is now brother says there was some
[1:13:24] reason that God let the seven voices be
[1:13:26] thundered because must come we find that
[1:13:28] Christ the lamb took the book in his
[1:13:29] hand he opened that seventh seal but you
[1:13:33] see it's a hidden mystery no one knows
[1:13:34] it right along with what he said no one
[1:13:36] would know his coming also would not
[1:13:38] know about the seven Thunder mystery so
[1:13:40] you see it's connected together brother
[1:13:42] Bram in 1963 later on that year he says
[1:13:46] this he said this book is already
[1:13:48] opened just waiting for the seventh seal
[1:13:50] to be identified of the coming of of
[1:13:54] Christ amen so four things again to to
[1:13:58] reiterate that tonight the end of all
[1:14:00] things the Thunders the third pole the
[1:14:03] coming of Christ everybody got it so
[1:14:06] far pH it's a lot when brother Brandon
[1:14:10] preaches this he does something he's
[1:14:11] never done
[1:14:13] before he edits the tape and he's very
[1:14:17] transparent about it he goes to the
[1:14:19] brothers that that took the tape he
[1:14:21] preaches a sermon and and then he goes
[1:14:25] the next day and he goes to the motel
[1:14:27] room of the brothers who were there
[1:14:29] making tapes and he told him he said I
[1:14:31] don't want this sent out the way it is
[1:14:33] and he goes and edits the tape we have
[1:14:35] both today we have both copies but he
[1:14:38] edits the tape to a certain point
[1:14:40] paragraph 261 and recorded a new portion
[1:14:42] of about 20 minutes in length he edits
[1:14:45] out most of what he said about the seven
[1:14:50] seal you think about that but there was
[1:14:52] silence in heaven right it wasn't time
[1:14:56] yet the recording was uh was only
[1:15:00] released in 1966 after brother brandom
[1:15:03] passes away now he he stops and he's got
[1:15:06] he said written on his note stop go no
[1:15:08] further and and but Joie does like we do
[1:15:11] sometimes and he goes a little further
[1:15:13] he had written on his notes don't go any
[1:15:15] further and he went a little further and
[1:15:17] then he goes back and takes it off I you
[1:15:21] know You' say why why would he do that
[1:15:23] well because again what are we what are
[1:15:26] we doing this this is a serious thing
[1:15:28] we're talking about the coming of the
[1:15:30] Lord we're talking about what God's
[1:15:31] doing in the end time God's going to do
[1:15:34] something he's not just going to educate
[1:15:36] people right he's going to do something
[1:15:39] he's going to get us ready for a Rapture
[1:15:42] so he's not going to tell Satan what
[1:15:43] he's going to do right so when he picks
[1:15:46] back up in the motel room the first
[1:15:48] thing he says is it will be a good thing
[1:15:50] he doesn't know anything about it
[1:15:51] because if he did then he would impr
[1:15:53] impersonate that that's his tricks in
[1:15:55] doing things you remember brother
[1:15:56] Brandon when he uh when he come out with
[1:15:59] the with the discernment he could
[1:16:00] discern the secret of the heart and uh
[1:16:03] people would come and it happened
[1:16:04] thousands of times it never failed it
[1:16:06] was never wrong no one's ever shown any
[1:16:09] scientific way that it could be done why
[1:16:12] how was he able to do that it wasn't a
[1:16:13] man we're not glorifying a man it was
[1:16:16] God just like any man is gifted to do
[1:16:19] anything or any man he he was a prophet
[1:16:21] just like in the Old Testament just like
[1:16:23] in uh John in the New Testament or Paul
[1:16:25] uh he was a prophet and so uh we find
[1:16:29] that uh he he did that but when he did
[1:16:31] that he tried to explain how it was done
[1:16:34] right and he said that's where I got in
[1:16:36] trouble because when he started
[1:16:37] explaining it that's how you ended up
[1:16:39] with the televangelist of today that's
[1:16:42] how you end up with the charismatic
[1:16:43] movement the entire charismatic movement
[1:16:46] today was started by the healing Revival
[1:16:48] of the 40s which is what brother
[1:16:49] brandham started you go look it up in
[1:16:52] history and so what was it it was
[1:16:55] something uh immediately began to be
[1:16:57] impersonated and you got guys standing
[1:16:59] up in the pulpit and saying well
[1:17:00] somewhere there's a headache somebody in
[1:17:02] the audience has a headache send me5 do
[1:17:04] and I'll tell you who you know and and
[1:17:07] and it was so generic and it was
[1:17:09] obviously false and what we've got today
[1:17:12] is laughable out there and I don't mean
[1:17:14] to hurt anybody there's a lot of
[1:17:15] nonsense out there a lot of nonsense on
[1:17:18] television today a lot of nonsense in
[1:17:21] Africa and all over the world just they
[1:17:24] get whole groups of people to follow
[1:17:25] them and it's just a a cult it's just
[1:17:27] nonsense but but that's not what we are
[1:17:30] we're not a we're not here to Rally
[1:17:32] around a man we're not here to Rally
[1:17:34] around a a Doctrine even we're here to
[1:17:37] to be Christians at the end time that
[1:17:39] that's what we are we believe what God
[1:17:41] Said and we're here to to manifest what
[1:17:44] God Said So uh when you begin to when
[1:17:48] you begin to realize how Satan
[1:17:49] immediately begin to impersonate that
[1:17:51] when he comes to the Third third poll of
[1:17:53] his ministry or the third phase of his
[1:17:55] ministry he says well we're we're not
[1:17:57] going to we're not going to tell anybody
[1:17:59] about this he said that's his tricks in
[1:18:01] doing things he said so therefore God
[1:18:03] has made it so hid to the whole world
[1:18:04] even to Heaven there's no way of
[1:18:06] understanding it only as God will reveal
[1:18:09] it himself oh I'm glad for that you see
[1:18:12] where where is that in the scripture
[1:18:13] Luke chap 10: 21 in that hour Jesus
[1:18:16] rejoiced in spirit and and said I thank
[1:18:20] thee oh Father Lord of Heaven and Earth
[1:18:22] that thou Hast hid these things now If
[1:18:25] you deny the sovereignty of God you got
[1:18:27] a hard time with this verse because
[1:18:30] Jesus said his father hid it think about
[1:18:34] it for a minute God hid his coming you
[1:18:37] have hid these things from the wise and
[1:18:39] prudent when he came the first time God
[1:18:41] hid it from the wise and prudent and has
[1:18:45] revealed them unto babes even so father
[1:18:48] for it seemed good in thy sight God has
[1:18:50] a right to have a family just like we
[1:18:52] have a right right to have a family he
[1:18:54] reveals it to who he wants to reveal it
[1:18:55] to what did he tell Moses I'll have
[1:18:57] mercy on whom I will have mercy I'll
[1:19:00] pardon who on whom I will pardon he he
[1:19:02] shows us that in Jacob and Esau and I
[1:19:04] don't want to get into election tonight
[1:19:06] but that's what God does he hides it
[1:19:09] from some reveals it to
[1:19:12] others so
[1:19:14] now Satan wouldn't know anything about
[1:19:17] it just like Jesus being born is what we
[1:19:19] said he doesn't know a thing about it
[1:19:21] but brother randam taught us he said it
[1:19:23] will be revealed uh in that day in the
[1:19:25] hour that it's supposed to be revealed
[1:19:28] in amen so he tells us he says the thing
[1:19:31] for us to do is be reverent before God
[1:19:34] and serve him and do all that we know
[1:19:35] how to do live good Christian lives I
[1:19:38] think that's good advice don't you he
[1:19:41] said here we find that the six seal has
[1:19:42] been open to us we see it and we know
[1:19:44] that this seven seal cannot be broke to
[1:19:46] the public until that hour arrive again
[1:19:50] he said now we have in completion now by
[1:19:51] the grace of God all the Myst the six
[1:19:53] seals that's been sealed up and we
[1:19:55] understand and know that the seventh
[1:19:57] seal is not to be known to the public
[1:19:59] notice the wording that he uses this is
[1:20:01] in that part that he adds on to the seal
[1:20:03] seventh seal again he said here when the
[1:20:05] seventh seal when he opened it he also
[1:20:07] omitted it again so we see it's a
[1:20:09] complete mystery therefore the hour is
[1:20:11] not yet for the mystery to be known
[1:20:13] therefore we're this far and the rest of
[1:20:15] it will be known right around about the
[1:20:17] time that Jesus appears on Earth again
[1:20:18] for his bride whatever takes place at
[1:20:20] that time he said now until that time
[1:20:22] let's just all pray live good straight
[1:20:24] Christian lives looking forward for his
[1:20:26] coming but we're this far he did tell us
[1:20:29] some things he told us it was the third
[1:20:30] poll he told us it was the Thunders he
[1:20:33] told us it was the coming of the Lord
[1:20:36] again what don't we know we don't know
[1:20:38] the day or the hour of his coming right
[1:20:40] we don't know when but we know it's it's
[1:20:43] it's going to happen
[1:20:45] now so far so
[1:20:49] good and I'm almost out of time now
[1:20:53] brother Brandon says now just be as
[1:20:55] patient as you can he said I feel in
[1:20:56] this here God will help me Will Reveal
[1:20:58] and bring into your mind all these other
[1:20:59] things I've talked on all through the
[1:21:02] days of the Tabernacle now this is three
[1:21:04] months after the seals brother Brandon
[1:21:07] preaches a sermon called Christ is the
[1:21:08] mystery of God revealed and if you go
[1:21:10] listen to it it's actually the second
[1:21:12] part of the seventh
[1:21:13] seal go listen to it and you'll find I
[1:21:16] think you'll find that that's true and
[1:21:19] he even begins exactly the same he said
[1:21:22] be as patient as you can he said you see
[1:21:23] why these things I've talked on through
[1:21:25] all the days of the Tabernacle why I've
[1:21:26] said what I've said I've done what I've
[1:21:28] done he said this is why he reads
[1:21:31] Colossians 1 or Colossians 1:1 15-29
[1:21:34] talks about Christ having the
[1:21:36] preeminence in the church he might have
[1:21:38] the preeminence oh isn't that what we
[1:21:40] want him to have tonight we want him to
[1:21:42] have the preeminence in our lives and he
[1:21:45] said God had a purpose and a hidden
[1:21:46] Mystery he said I want to speak to the
[1:21:48] church this this morning the hidden
[1:21:50] Mystery of God and he had in his mind
[1:21:51] before the world ever be began he said
[1:21:53] how that has unfolded itself right down
[1:21:56] to this present hour that we're living
[1:21:58] so God was actually unfolding more even
[1:22:01] than what he had unfolded during the
[1:22:02] seals he said then you will understand
[1:22:05] clearly you see I believe in what is
[1:22:07] being done he said God's great mystery
[1:22:10] of how he said it's a secret he kept it
[1:22:13] a secret nobody know nothing about it
[1:22:15] even the angels didn't understand it see
[1:22:16] he didn't reveal it remember there's two
[1:22:19] things you didn't know how or when but
[1:22:22] but now watch for just a moment he said
[1:22:25] Jesus when he was on Earth they wanted
[1:22:26] to know when he would come he said even
[1:22:28] the son himself don't know when it's
[1:22:29] going to happen God has this all to
[1:22:31] himself it's a secret said that's the
[1:22:33] reason there was silence in heaven for a
[1:22:34] space of a half hour seven Thunders
[1:22:36] utter their voices and John was even
[1:22:38] forbidden to right it see the coming of
[1:22:39] the Lord he said that's one thing he
[1:22:41] hasn't revealed yet how he will come
[1:22:43] when he will come he said it's a good
[1:22:45] thing that he
[1:22:47] doesn't I'm gonna get ahead of myself
[1:22:49] here we know how
[1:22:53] right the Rapture message we know how
[1:22:57] the shout is a
[1:22:59] message right he comes re 1
[1:23:01] Thessalonians 4 he descends with a shout
[1:23:04] a voice with a trumpet shout is a
[1:23:06] message Amen to get us ready get the
[1:23:09] bride ready now he he shown us how we
[1:23:12] just don't know when but he said he has
[1:23:15] showed it or revealed it in every type
[1:23:16] that's in the Bible therefore the entire
[1:23:19] Bible someone say the entire Bible is
[1:23:22] the revelation of God's mystery in
[1:23:24] Christ entire Bible is an expression of
[1:23:27] one goal that God had one purpose he
[1:23:29] wanted to achieve in the entire Bible
[1:23:31] you want to know what the seals are
[1:23:32] about you want to know what the Bible's
[1:23:34] about this is it he said all the acts of
[1:23:38] the Believers in the Bible has been in
[1:23:39] type an expressing of what God's Great
[1:23:42] goal is now in this last days he he's
[1:23:45] revealed it and shows it he said in
[1:23:47] God's help we'll see it right here this
[1:23:48] morning what the Lord has had in his
[1:23:50] mind all along and has expressed it what
[1:23:52] was it the three-fold purpose God
[1:23:54] expressing himself in his son Jesus
[1:23:57] Christ God expressing himself in his
[1:24:00] church having the preeminence in the
[1:24:02] church and thirdly going back to the
[1:24:05] Garden of Eden again God expressing
[1:24:08] himself oh my oh don't you see what he
[1:24:10] was doing he was bringing about uh
[1:24:13] through the through the Revelation
[1:24:14] through the opening of the word he's
[1:24:16] bringing us back into a condition where
[1:24:18] we can give him preeminence again where
[1:24:21] we're not bound by domination we're not
[1:24:23] bound by uh by man's ideas we're not
[1:24:26] bound by what the world thinks about us
[1:24:28] we're not bound by all the filth and the
[1:24:30] nonsense of the world but we've come
[1:24:32] back to a place where we can be a bride
[1:24:34] to Jesus Christ for his
[1:24:37] coming right so that's his purpose today
[1:24:40] is to be preeminent in the church he
[1:24:43] said now he's Sanctified with his spirit
[1:24:44] and blood a church that he might make
[1:24:46] every promise in this last day be
[1:24:48] revealed someone say every promise so he
[1:24:52] he could go back and pick up what these
[1:24:53] other fellows has left off here in the
[1:24:55] last days by his holy spirit reveal all
[1:24:58] the mystery of the Seven Seals he said
[1:25:00] see he is expressing himself that's his
[1:25:03] purpose that's why he died that's the
[1:25:05] second fold of his three-fold
[1:25:07] manifestation first to express himself
[1:25:09] in Christ then Express himself to the
[1:25:11] church and the same thing Christ was the
[1:25:13] word and the church becomes the word
[1:25:15] when it lets the word go through them oh
[1:25:18] I hope you hear me tonight the church
[1:25:20] becomes the word when it lets the word
[1:25:22] go through them what is the opening of
[1:25:24] the seals now think about it he said
[1:25:27] that's his purpose that's why he had to
[1:25:28] reveal the mystery of the Seven Seals in
[1:25:30] this hour was to be preeminent in the
[1:25:33] church to become the word in the bride
[1:25:37] so I can say it like this we are the
[1:25:39] manifestation of the seven seal we are
[1:25:42] the the one that's been prepared for his
[1:25:44] coming we are the ones who have the the
[1:25:47] we we are the mystery we are the bride
[1:25:49] Revival we are the big fish that was a
[1:25:52] attracted if you know what I'm talking
[1:25:53] about we are the bride's Revival we are
[1:25:56] the people he has preeminent
[1:25:59] in
[1:26:02] amen you say that that's big talk can
[1:26:06] you back it
[1:26:08] up listen you back it up every day in
[1:26:10] your
[1:26:11] life every day you overcome the slay to
[1:26:14] see and age you back that up every day
[1:26:17] and I challenge you because not
[1:26:18] everybody that says they believe this
[1:26:19] message or even believe what I'm talking
[1:26:21] about tonight would be even a
[1:26:24] Christian there's always a mixed
[1:26:26] multitude there's always three kinds of
[1:26:27] Believers but I challenge you to be a
[1:26:29] real believer tonight challenge you to
[1:26:31] live
[1:26:32] it to walk that's why it's it's more
[1:26:35] than an emotional Revival it's more than
[1:26:37] just shouting and that's part of it but
[1:26:39] that's not all there is it's more than
[1:26:41] healing that's part of it but that's not
[1:26:43] all there is it's more than all of these
[1:26:45] things what is it it's living it's just
[1:26:49] living and we show by becoming like
[1:26:52] Christ who we are we prove to the world
[1:26:56] not by going through the scripture and
[1:26:58] tying them up in the
[1:27:00] scriptures that's not how we're going to
[1:27:03] oh my it's not how we express Christ we
[1:27:06] don't express Christ just by preaching
[1:27:08] we don't express Christ just by yelling
[1:27:10] at people are you with me tonight but
[1:27:13] Jason you can express Christ uh Peter
[1:27:16] you can express Christ all of you can
[1:27:19] Emma you can express Christ somehow your
[1:27:22] life in the way that you conduct
[1:27:23] yourself around other young people you
[1:27:25] can express Christ to the
[1:27:28] world it's that simple that we've made
[1:27:31] it some great big intellectual thing
[1:27:33] it's not understanding it it's
[1:27:35] expressing it it's just living it it's
[1:27:37] just becoming the word for our day it's
[1:27:40] something that was so hidden from the
[1:27:41] world and so it's so simple that the
[1:27:44] world can't see it but he said God hides
[1:27:46] himself in Simplicity and then reveals
[1:27:49] himself in the same he hides himself in
[1:27:52] Simplicity he reveals himself in
[1:27:54] Simplicity in the simple bride living on
[1:27:56] the earth you are the people he has the
[1:27:59] preeminence in say thanks be to God for
[1:28:03] that and then that's not a book of rules
[1:28:06] it's not a cult or some guy standing up
[1:28:08] here beating you over the head telling
[1:28:09] you how to dress and how to live I I I
[1:28:12] very rarely have to preach to you about
[1:28:15] how you dress or what you do you realize
[1:28:18] why I very rarely have to do that
[1:28:20] because you want to serve God there's
[1:28:23] something in you that just wants to
[1:28:24] serve God you want to live for God you
[1:28:26] want to love God you want to do what the
[1:28:28] Bible says and and we'll talk about
[1:28:31] those things but you're not you don't do
[1:28:32] that just because I beat you over the
[1:28:34] head with it you do it because you love
[1:28:36] God that's the time we've got to live in
[1:28:37] church we got to go beyond the uh
[1:28:40] there's a time for the ABCs I believe
[1:28:41] we've got that but we've got to come up
[1:28:43] higher we've got to reach the place
[1:28:45] where we are that Ephesian church that's
[1:28:47] going back into the land that's taking
[1:28:49] our
[1:28:51] land this message is more than stories
[1:28:54] I've just laid a groundwork here tonight
[1:28:56] a a a platform for where we want to go
[1:28:59] in the seven seal but this message is
[1:29:01] more than stories it's the living bread
[1:29:04] of life bringing forth the bride we're
[1:29:07] not feeding on the words of a man we're
[1:29:09] feeding on the body word of the
[1:29:11] unfailing body word of the son of
[1:29:13] man I want to leave you with this
[1:29:16] because there's some that believe the
[1:29:17] seven seal is not
[1:29:19] open if the seven seal based on what
[1:29:21] we've read tonight and what we've
[1:29:23] already seen just in this short study
[1:29:25] tonight if the seventh seal is not open
[1:29:28] we cannot have rapturing
[1:29:29] faith I want to go in a Rapture I don't
[1:29:32] know about
[1:29:34] you our hearts can't be turned
[1:29:37] back think about it if it's not open we
[1:29:39] don't have rapturing faith our hearts
[1:29:42] have not been turned back because it'll
[1:29:43] be those revealed mystery truths that
[1:29:45] will do
[1:29:46] it the Greater Works cannot be done by
[1:29:49] the bride the manifestation of the third
[1:29:51] pole in the bride can can't be
[1:29:52] done right we cannot manifest the
[1:29:56] fullness of Christ and the word in our
[1:29:57] lives because there's some part
[1:29:59] missing look you realize what a what a
[1:30:01] great thing that
[1:30:03] is I believe it's open I believe the
[1:30:06] book is open I believe a mighty angel
[1:30:08] came down in our day wasn't a prophet
[1:30:10] Christ I believe came down in our day
[1:30:13] and it wasn't that man that man was a
[1:30:14] man like any other man but it was Christ
[1:30:17] in a man just like it's Christ in you
[1:30:18] the hope of glory as Paul says Christ in
[1:30:21] you and Christ in me oh I'm so glad for
[1:30:23] that today so glad he can reveal himself
[1:30:26] simply in our day but see it's so hard
[1:30:28] because we it's hid behind a veil of
[1:30:30] Flesh the seventh seal hid behind veil
[1:30:32] of Flesh he's always been hid behind
[1:30:34] flesh always hid himself that way they
[1:30:37] said that couldn't be God but it was God
[1:30:40] they said we know his his mother we know
[1:30:41] his brothers but he was God he was God
[1:30:44] In the Flesh amen the musicians would
[1:30:48] come when all the seals were open the
[1:30:51] silence was
[1:30:53] broken there was a half hour of Silence
[1:30:57] a short time half hour when the seals
[1:31:01] were open the silence was broken John
[1:31:04] shouted so loud everyone in Heaven could
[1:31:06] hear
[1:31:07] him Amen brother brandham calls that the
[1:31:10] worship time for the king lamb I'll say
[1:31:13] this he's the one we
[1:31:15] worship we worship the lamb the lamb
[1:31:18] that opened the seals not the prophet
[1:31:19] that showed us that that took the book
[1:31:22] and uh from the lamb that was already
[1:31:23] opened by the hands of the lamb but it
[1:31:25] was the lamb that we worship it's Christ
[1:31:28] that we worship I think we ought to do
[1:31:30] that tonight if we bow our heads
[1:31:32] together I think it's worship time
[1:31:35] brother bandam tells us now everything
[1:31:37] is
[1:31:38] worship every people that should be able
[1:31:41] to worship God it ought to be us say but
[1:31:44] brother Ben you don't know what I've
[1:31:45] been through I don't but I know what
[1:31:47] God's about to
[1:31:50] do I know what he's about about to do he
[1:31:52] said well when will it happen I don't
[1:31:53] know that but I know in a moment in a
[1:31:56] twinkling of an eye these bodies are
[1:31:58] going to be changed and we're going home
[1:32:00] and that makes everything look small
[1:32:02] doesn't
[1:32:03] it we shall not all sleep but we shall
[1:32:06] all be
[1:32:08] changed he said the dead in Christ shall
[1:32:10] rise first and we which are alive and
[1:32:12] remain to the coming Lord shall not
[1:32:14] hinder them which are asleep oh my the
[1:32:17] Lord himself shall descend from heaven
[1:32:19] with a shout with the voice of an
[1:32:20] archangel with the trumpet of God the
[1:32:22] dead in Christ arise first I tell you
[1:32:24] what I believe we're living in those
[1:32:27] times in these times we're living in the
[1:32:29] manifestation of the son of man we're
[1:32:31] living the unfolding of the seven seal
[1:32:34] it's the end time and if we are then we
[1:32:36] ought to we ought to live like it we
[1:32:38] ought to believe it we ought to trust
[1:32:40] him with all of our Lives all of our
[1:32:41] heart we ought to worship him like never
[1:32:43] before let's just pray that way could we
[1:32:46] if you got something that maybe
[1:32:48] something you've been dealing with in
[1:32:49] your life you just want to talk to him
[1:32:51] for a minute say Lord I want to be ready
[1:32:53] I want to be ready to go I I I don't
[1:32:55] want to be left here for the tribulation
[1:32:58] period I I want to want to go home I
[1:33:01] want to go with Jesus I want to go with
[1:33:03] you would you just talk to him like that
[1:33:04] tonight maybe you don't understand all
[1:33:07] the things that I've said tonight but if
[1:33:09] you don't you just be as good a
[1:33:10] Christian as you can be you young people
[1:33:12] you you live for God with all of your
[1:33:15] heart trust him trust him in every
[1:33:17] moment of your life and he'll he'll do
[1:33:19] right by you he he'll never fail you'll
[1:33:22] never leave you never forsake you

[1:33:26] you we thank you for this night
[1:33:29] Lord Lord as I my heart is stirred
[1:33:32] tonight as we begin to preach on these
[1:33:34] things and just kind of laying a
[1:33:36] groundwork for where we want to go in
[1:33:37] the future but Lord I I pray that it
[1:33:40] would be helpful to somebody Lord to
[1:33:43] recognize that the seals are open and
[1:33:46] the lamb has taken the book and here we
[1:33:48] are we're living right here in the
[1:33:50] closing days of

[1:34:00] that I pray God that you'll move in our
[1:34:04] lives Lord if there's one that's not

[1:34:07] come to that place in you tonight and
[1:34:10] they would make themselves ready Lord I
[1:34:13] pray you'd bring Revelation to our
[1:34:14] hearts Lord give us humility with it
