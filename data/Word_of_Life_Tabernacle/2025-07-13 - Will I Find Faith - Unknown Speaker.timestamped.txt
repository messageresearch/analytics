[47:06] [Music]
[47:14] Just

[47:22] that I am
[47:25] redeemed.
[47:26] I like this one.
[47:28] Oh, I will tell
[47:33] his favor
[47:35] and I'll tell
[47:38] his love
[47:40] and I'll tell
[47:43] his goodness
[47:46] to me as the glory. Oh yes, he purchases
[47:53] my redemption
[47:56] with his own
[47:59] precious blood
[48:01] and from sin.
[48:04] Oh, I am
[48:07] set free
[48:11] to high.
[48:14] [Applause]
[48:14] [Music]
[48:18] Oh, how many make that your testimony
[48:20] here this morning?
[48:22] Oh, yes. Jesus
[48:26] has changed my whole life.
[48:31] [Music]
[48:39] Oh, just
[48:42] I am. Oh, won't you tell them
[48:47] that I am?
[48:51] Amen. We're going to sing that one again
[48:52] as we invite our pastor to come out.
[48:54] Amen. I wonder how many this morning as
[48:56] we sing it can put your hand up and say,
[48:57] "I'm redeemed. I'm bought with a price.
[49:00] Jesus has changed my whole life."
[49:02] Somebody ought to give the Lord praise
[49:04] here this morning. Amen. If he's done a
[49:06] good work, I believe he's going to
[49:07] finish what he started in. Can you
[49:09] believe it? Amen. As we invite our
[49:12] pastor, I want you to just sing it like
[49:13] you mean it this morning. Make that your
[49:15] testimony. Jesus changed my whole life.
[49:17] Aren't you glad about it? Amen. As we
[49:19] get ready for the word now.
[49:22] Oh, just who
[49:25] I am. Oh, won't you tell them
[49:31] that I am I redeemed with all your
[49:35] hearts now? Oh, sing it.
[49:39] I
[49:40] [Music]
[49:42] redeemed.
[49:43] Oh, I've been born with
[49:47] the cross. Don't you know that Jesus
[49:52] has changed my whole life?
[49:59] Oh
[50:01] my
[50:05] [Music]
[50:08] I am. Oh, won't you tell them
[50:14] that I am?
[50:17] Oh, one more time with all your hearts
[50:18] now. Tell me that I am
[50:25] redeemed.
[50:26] Oh yes, I walk with
[50:30] the price.
[50:32] Oh my Jesus. Oh you.
[50:38] Oh,
[50:40] is that the way you feel this morning?
[50:43] Oh, baby.
[50:46] We ask you.
[50:49] Oh, just who who I am. Why don't you
[50:55] tell them? Oh my. Oh, I am
[51:00] redeemed. Let's sing it one more time
[51:01] with all our hearts now. Oh, sing it.
[51:06] [Music]
[51:09] Oh, I'm involved with with the price.
[51:15] Oh, my Jesus.
[51:18] He has changed my whole life.
[51:25] Oh, if anybody
[51:30] asks you, tell them just who
[51:34] I am. Why don't you tell them
[51:40] who I am?
[51:42] [Music]
[51:46] Baby, go ahead. Give him a hand clap of
[51:48] praise for sure. Thank the Lord. Aren't
[51:52] you glad to be redeemed? Redeemed means
[51:54] to be bought back. Means you were his.
[51:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:01] &gt;&gt; If you were his. It means you were in
[52:03] his mind before the foundation of the
[52:04] world. You were his. You couldn't be
[52:06] lost. And he he you were in the pawn
[52:09] shop. You put yourself there by sin and
[52:12] and Adam's sin. And yet you the the the
[52:15] hand of God reached down and brought you
[52:17] out of the pawn shop. What is that?
[52:19] Redemption. You can stand today and
[52:21] worship and say I am redeemed. If
[52:24] anybody asks me just what I am, I am
[52:27] redeemed. Hallelujah.
[52:30] Oh, thank the Lord. Amen. Aren't you
[52:32] glad for his presence this morning? It
[52:35] good to see each one of you, Sister
[52:37] Amber. My goodness, you look just like
[52:40] your mom. And
[52:42] my goodness, it's been a while since
[52:45] I've preached and Sister Amber was in
[52:46] the audience. I remember preaching to
[52:48] her 20 years ago
[52:51] when we were both a lot younger and and
[52:54] uh we sure appreciate having you today.
[52:56] God bless you each one for being here.
[52:58] Let's bow our heads together.
[53:01] Heavenly Father,
[53:03] oh, we're so thankful to be your
[53:06] children this morning, Lord.
[53:08] So thankful for that keeping power,
[53:10] Lord. Though we Lord, though we were
[53:13] lost in the pawn shop, yet you brought
[53:15] us out, Lord. You We were in your hand.
[53:19] We're so thankful for that. We belong to
[53:21] you. I pray, God, that you'd just move
[53:24] this morning in a mighty way, Lord. May
[53:27] there not be one person leave here,
[53:29] Lord, in the same condition that they
[53:31] came in, but may they leave better,
[53:33] Lord. Myself as well, Lord. I I want to
[53:37] I want to be better. I want to do more.
[53:39] I want to have more fervor, Lord. More
[53:42] desire, oh God. Pray you'd grant it
[53:44] today. More revelation of your word.
[53:47] Pray that you'd move now. Lord, if
[53:49] there's any sick among us, I pray you'd
[53:51] heal those that are sick. Lord, touch
[53:53] everybody, every heart. We pray in
[53:56] Jesus' name. Amen.
[53:59] Amen. I bless you this morning.
[54:03] Amen. Isn't God good to us?
[54:06] &gt;&gt; Luke chapter 18 and verse one.
[54:11] I want to say thank you in advance for
[54:14] all the hard work uh to get ready for
[54:16] the meetings and then the meetings
[54:18] themselves that y'all are the best folks
[54:20] in the world at doing those things. And
[54:22] so we thank you for that. And we just
[54:25] believe the Lord's going to bless us
[54:27] mightily in the meetings and we thank
[54:29] you for for being here for that and for
[54:32] being here today. Luke chapter 18 and
[54:35] verse one,
[54:37] he spake a parable unto them to this end
[54:40] that men ought always to pray and not to
[54:43] faint, saying, there was in a city a
[54:46] judge which feared not God, neither
[54:49] regarded man. And there was a widow in
[54:52] that city, and she came unto him,
[54:54] saying, Avenge me of mine adversary.
[54:58] and he would not for a while. But
[55:00] afterward he said within himself,
[55:02] "Though I fear not God, nor regard man,
[55:06] yet because this widow troubleth me, I
[55:09] will avenge her, lest by her continual
[55:12] coming, she weary me." And the Lord
[55:15] said, "Hear what the unjust judge saith.
[55:19] And shall not God avenge his own elect
[55:23] who cry day and night unto him, though
[55:25] he bear long with them? I tell you that
[55:29] he will avenge them speedily.
[55:31] Nevertheless, when the Son of Man
[55:33] cometh, shall he find faith on the
[55:36] earth." I want to take that for a text
[55:38] this morning. Will I find faith? God
[55:41] bless you as you have your seats this
[55:43] morning.
[55:46] Brother Brandham picks up uh on that in
[55:49] a sermon titled the anointed ones at the
[55:51] end time and he he says here's the
[55:54] question if you follow in that line in
[55:57] this hour he said will it be finished
[56:00] will I find the faith will Malachi 4 be
[56:04] fulfilled in this time restore the faith
[56:08] of the children back to the faith of the
[56:11] fathers the original the word notice he
[56:14] says the faith of the children. Let's
[56:16] read Malachi 4 and verse 5. He said,
[56:19] "Behold, I will send you Elijah the
[56:21] prophet before the coming of the great
[56:23] and dreadful day of the Lord. And he
[56:25] shall turn the heart of the fathers to
[56:27] the children and the heart of the
[56:29] children to their fathers, lest I come
[56:31] and smite the earth with a curse." He He
[56:33] says, "Turn the heart." Brother Brandham
[56:35] says, "Turn the faith." The heart the
[56:38] faith. And we know to turn back is to
[56:41] restore. If you would to go back to an
[56:44] original condition is literally to
[56:46] restore. And but brother Brandon puts
[56:48] the word faith in there. Again, he does
[56:50] that all through the message, all
[56:52] through his ministry. He said the
[56:53] messenger of this age was to come in the
[56:55] power of Elias. He said that he was to
[56:57] restore the faith of the children back
[57:00] to the fathers. Bring the Pentecostal
[57:02] remnant that's left back to the true
[57:05] apostolic faith. The Pentecostal remnant
[57:08] that's left back to the true apostolic
[57:11] faith. Now, brother Random is is taking
[57:13] this from Jude 3 where Jude says,
[57:15] "Beloved, when I gave all diligence to
[57:17] write unto you the common salvation, it
[57:19] was needful for me to write unto you and
[57:21] exhort you that you should earnestly
[57:23] contend for the faith which was once
[57:26] delivered unto the saints." So, he's
[57:27] telling him there is a faith that was
[57:29] once delivered to the saints. He said,
[57:31] "I want you to contend for that." And he
[57:34] says, so brother Brandham ties that to
[57:36] Malachi 4. He said he will restore the
[57:39] faith back that was lost. Now Malachi 4
[57:43] is not a restoration of doctrine to the
[57:46] head.
[57:48] &gt;&gt; It is not a restoration of doctrine to
[57:50] the head. And I think that's what we've
[57:52] made it many times. We've made it an
[57:54] intellectual thing that well if I
[57:56] understand it. I want to tell you this
[57:58] morning. You may not understand
[58:00] everything about the message. You may
[58:02] not understand everything how to put it
[58:04] all together. But I tell you this this
[58:06] morning, if you believe it, it'll have
[58:08] the same benefit as if you completely
[58:10] understood it. And I believe the bride
[58:12] of Christ can understand, but yet those
[58:15] things you don't understand yet will be
[58:17] revealed to you because of faith. If you
[58:20] don't believe, it doesn't matter how
[58:21] much you know, you will never accept it.
[58:24] But if you can believe, then
[58:27] understanding can come to you. Now
[58:29] Malachi 4 again, it's not a restoration
[58:31] of doctrine to the head. It's not it's
[58:34] not a if that was the case, he would
[58:36] have just sent a theologian. If all he
[58:39] wanted was doctrine restored, he would
[58:41] have sent a theologian. If all he wanted
[58:43] was a was a uh restoration of
[58:47] understanding, he would have sent a
[58:48] wellspoken man. But he sent a Kentucky
[58:51] hillbilly. He sent somebody who who had
[58:54] visions and saw miracles and things
[58:57] happened in his ministry. What for? It
[58:58] was a restoration not of the head, but
[59:01] of the heart. And
[59:02] &gt;&gt; he had to get our attention by the sign
[59:04] so we could be led to the word.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; So, brother Rand said, "This messenger
[59:10] in Malachi 4 and Revelation 10:7 is
[59:12] going to do two things. This is very
[59:15] important. I've read this to you many
[59:17] times, but I want us to understand it."
[59:19] Sometimes I feel like a broken record up
[59:20] here, but but it it it matters.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; This is very important to our salvation,
[59:26] to what we believe. He said according to
[59:28] Malachi 4, he will turn the hearts of
[59:31] the children to the fathers. Two, he
[59:34] will reveal the mysteries of the seven
[59:36] thunders in Revelation 10, which are the
[59:40] revelations contained in the seven
[59:42] seals. So, we're not looking for seven
[59:45] thunders to come. Those revelations have
[59:48] been revealed to us. He said, "It will
[59:51] be these divinely revealed mystery
[59:54] truths that literally turn the hearts of
[59:58] the children to the Pentecostal
[1:00:02] fathers."
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; So it will restore the faith
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; of the children.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Till you could believe.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; So the signs of his presence as we
[1:00:13] talked about Wednesday night, it brought
[1:00:15] us to our attention. The first poll, the
[1:00:18] second poll brought our attention to the
[1:00:20] third pole, right?
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; Which then they they increased our faith
[1:00:24] to believe the word which was the
[1:00:27] presence of God itself. So the signs of
[1:00:30] his presence caused us to believe the
[1:00:32] presence of God itself that it was here.
[1:00:35] Now the angel taught brother Brandham
[1:00:37] remember the third pole uh uh vision
[1:00:40] that he had. He had a vision of catching
[1:00:42] fish which I like. I I think that's
[1:00:44] pretty good vision right there. just the
[1:00:46] fact that he was catching fish. And so
[1:00:48] the vision was that he would uh he would
[1:00:51] uh he would fish and he said the first
[1:00:53] pull he said it it it didn't hardly pull
[1:00:56] up any kind of fish at all. It was just
[1:00:57] so small. The second pole, but brother
[1:00:59] Brandham tried to explain it. He said,
[1:01:01] "Don't do that." He got his line all
[1:01:03] tangled up. He said, "But on the third
[1:01:05] pole," he said, "That's where you catch
[1:01:07] your rainbow trout. That's where you
[1:01:09] catch your big fish is on the third
[1:01:10] pole." So the angel told him, "Don't set
[1:01:12] the hook
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; until the third pole." All right.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; In the first poll, he said, "Show the
[1:01:17] lure."
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; The second pole, show the lure.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; Right. In the third pole, set the hook.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; The sign attracted my attention.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; Right. I My attention was attracted by
[1:01:29] the sign of the hand. My attention was
[1:01:31] attracted by the by the revealing of the
[1:01:33] secrets of the heart. But it was the
[1:01:35] word that set the hook in me. The word
[1:01:37] is what caught me. The word is what made
[1:01:39] it where I can't turn back. where I can
[1:01:41] listen. I was not I am not the hook is
[1:01:44] not I'm not hooked by just miracles. I'm
[1:01:47] not just hooked by those things, but I'm
[1:01:49] hooked by the word itself.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; Don't set the hook until the third pull.
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; The B says this. He said many people
[1:01:57] will sponsor a healing meeting. Many
[1:02:00] will come to a healing meeting through a
[1:02:01] song festival. But when it comes to a
[1:02:04] poor lost soul to get saved, there's not
[1:02:06] many people interested in that.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; He said, but that's the main thing.
[1:02:10] divine healing and seeing festivals and
[1:02:12] so forth. He said, as brother Bossworth
[1:02:13] used to say, it's the bait on the hook.
[1:02:16] You show the fish the bait, not the
[1:02:17] hook,
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; right? And that's just the thing to get
[1:02:20] the people to listen a while
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; until you can really present to them
[1:02:24] your message.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; God has did that. Listen, in every age,
[1:02:28] through every age, there's always been a
[1:02:30] healing campaign. And if it's a genuine
[1:02:33] healing campaign, behind the campaign
[1:02:35] always is a message. There never is a
[1:02:38] sign given just for a sign. It's
[1:02:41] forerunning a message.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm glad that God still uses
[1:02:46] bait on the hook.
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; I want you to understand, we still don't
[1:02:50] fish
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; with a hook and no bait.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; When we fish, we still have bait on the
[1:02:58] hook.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham never stopped fishing
[1:03:01] with bait, if we could put it like that.
[1:03:03] He always continued to have miracles and
[1:03:06] signs and wonders in his ministry even
[1:03:09] during the opening of the word. Now why
[1:03:11] does brother Brandham do that? Because
[1:03:12] there are still people who need to be
[1:03:14] attracted that way. In fact ourselves
[1:03:17] many times just in our flesh and in our
[1:03:19] spirit we we need to be our our
[1:03:22] attention to be caught.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; Right. So we can receive the word.
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; Why do we have a song service the way we
[1:03:27] do and we try to make it where the
[1:03:29] presence of the Lord is here with us?
[1:03:31] Why do we want to come together in in
[1:03:33] the atmosphere of faith? Because we want
[1:03:35] our attention to be caught
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; so we can hear the word.
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Everything else has got our
[1:03:41] attention, but the bait catches our
[1:03:43] attention so we can hear the word. Are
[1:03:45] you with me so far?
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; So, so there has to be a you know, and
[1:03:49] it had to come at the third pole. You
[1:03:51] remember if you go listen to perfect
[1:03:53] faith, Brandon talks about how Jesus had
[1:03:55] perfect faith because he knew who he
[1:03:57] was. Yeah,
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; he had confidence in who he was,
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; right? That he was God in flesh,
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; he said he had confidence in what the
[1:04:05] word says he was,
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; And he said you can have confidence in
[1:04:10] what the word says you are.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; What does the word say? You are a
[1:04:13] believer.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; He said, "And these signs shall follow
[1:04:16] them that believe."
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; So you can have confidence in what the
[1:04:19] word says you are. But why did we need
[1:04:21] the third pole to have this uh perfect
[1:04:24] faith? Why did we need that? Why are
[1:04:26] those two things tied together? Why did
[1:04:28] we need the message of Malachi 4 to be
[1:04:30] restored back to faith? We needed it. Oh
[1:04:33] my. Because in order to come to perfect
[1:04:35] faith, we had to have a word that would
[1:04:38] bring us to that. There had to be
[1:04:40] something. And we were attracted. We
[1:04:42] were brought in. But there had to be a
[1:04:43] word that would restore our hearts back
[1:04:45] to make us recognize who we are.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; Oh my. I had to recognize I was not the
[1:04:51] son of John and Sharon Puit. But brother
[1:04:53] said, I'm not the son of Charles and
[1:04:54] Ella Brandom. I'm a son of God. I come
[1:04:56] from God. Why did he preach to us
[1:04:58] election and predestination? All of
[1:05:00] these things, the seed of God, the gene
[1:05:02] of God, because we had to know who we
[1:05:04] are.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; And when with this message, we ought to
[1:05:07] have more faith than we've ever had.
[1:05:08] There shouldn't be less faith today than
[1:05:10] there was in by gone days. We should
[1:05:12] have more faith because it tells us who
[1:05:14] we are. And this is the only way you can
[1:05:15] have perfect faith is when you have
[1:05:17] confidence in who you are.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; People aren't attracted by a naked hook.
[1:05:27] I remember some years ago, you might if
[1:05:29] you're fishing with just the hook, you
[1:05:31] might catch the wrong kind of fish.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; We were might catch an old shoe out
[1:05:36] there. I was in Bass Pro years ago and
[1:05:39] they had a fishing exhibition. They had
[1:05:42] a great big tank in there and and this
[1:05:45] guy's up there. He said, "I want to show
[1:05:46] you something." He said, "These hooks
[1:05:47] will catch more fish than other hooks."
[1:05:50] So, he had red hooks and boy, he sold me
[1:05:54] because, you know, I've used red hooks
[1:05:56] for years because that guy took a red
[1:05:58] hook, he took a regular hook and put it
[1:05:59] down there and them little fish just
[1:06:01] swam around. But when he put the red
[1:06:03] hook down there, boy, they they they
[1:06:05] were attracted to it and they bit that
[1:06:07] red hook with nothing on it. Thought,
[1:06:09] well, that's interesting. But they were
[1:06:10] all bluegill.
[1:06:12] And I found out that if you want small
[1:06:14] fish, use a small bait
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; and use a use you could use just a hook,
[1:06:21] right? There's spots where you can go.
[1:06:23] If you get a nest of bluegill, you can
[1:06:24] throw almost anything in there and catch
[1:06:26] one. Some of you fishermanmen know
[1:06:28] that's right.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; But if you want a trophy fish,
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; you got to use bait that'll catch it.
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; If you go up to this river, I've never
[1:06:36] caught a walleye on the Spring River
[1:06:38] because I've never fished for one. I've
[1:06:40] always fished for trout and I have a
[1:06:42] good time catching trout, but there's
[1:06:43] big walleye in that river that I've
[1:06:45] never caught because I didn't have the
[1:06:47] appropriate bait to catch it.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; You still can't catch the elect without
[1:06:51] the bait.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; And you may catch other things, but you
[1:06:56] got to fish for what you're looking for.
[1:06:58] If you want believers, you got to fish
[1:07:00] with something positive. You got to have
[1:07:01] something to attract believers on the
[1:07:04] hook or or the believer's never going to
[1:07:06] bite.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; Right? I if you go up here and fish, we
[1:07:08] fish for rainbow. I'm getting way too in
[1:07:10] the weeds on fishing because I haven't
[1:07:11] been fishing in a while. But I if you go
[1:07:13] up here and fish for rainbow trout, you
[1:07:15] won't catch very many brown trout. You
[1:07:17] got to change your bait and catch the
[1:07:19] kind of fish that you're looking for.
[1:07:21] Are you with me now? If you go fishing
[1:07:23] for bluegill, you need to change your
[1:07:24] bait to catch largemouth bass. Listen,
[1:07:27] in order to catch the elect, there had
[1:07:29] to be a a bait that would attract the
[1:07:31] elect
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; because there's a capacity in the elect
[1:07:34] to believe that these signs are true,
[1:07:36] that they're they're a reality to us.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; We believe in a cloud. We believe in a
[1:07:41] pillar of fire. We believe in healing.
[1:07:43] We believe in the secrets of men's
[1:07:44] hearts being revealed. There's something
[1:07:46] inside of us to believe. We may not
[1:07:48] understand it all. We may not be able to
[1:07:50] explain it all, but there's something in
[1:07:51] our hearts. We believe. How many can say
[1:07:53] that this morning? I'm a believer. I
[1:07:56] believe God's word is true. I believe if
[1:07:58] he said I can be healed, I can be
[1:07:59] healed. If he said my children are
[1:08:01] saved, that they are saved.
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; Why? Because I'm a believer.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; I can't explain to you why, but I'm a
[1:08:08] believer. Why do I believe it's we're
[1:08:10] going to make it? Why do I believe we're
[1:08:11] going in a rapture? Because I'm a
[1:08:13] believer.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; God's word said so.
[1:08:17] So now, so I have to have a revelation.
[1:08:20] The third poll brings to me a revelation
[1:08:21] that I'm a believer. I'm a son of God.
[1:08:24] And then I can then I can go on into
[1:08:27] perfect faith. Now we've been caught.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; Right. I think what all of us I believe
[1:08:33] this message of the hour, we can say
[1:08:34] that I've been caught.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; I can feast on the third pole. I don't
[1:08:38] just need the bait. I I I've got I've
[1:08:40] been caught. I've been taken into the
[1:08:42] boat onto the shore.
[1:08:45] But the bait still attracts us. I know a
[1:08:48] lot of people say, "Well, I don't need
[1:08:50] bait no more.
[1:08:52] I don't need to see nothing.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; I just believe. Okay.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; If that was true, you'd never ask for
[1:08:59] prayer.
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; Right? Brother Brandham said if you had
[1:09:03] perfect faith, you'd never have to come
[1:09:04] in a prayer line.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; Right? Because you just you just believe
[1:09:09] where you're at.
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; But Brother Brandham himself still come
[1:09:13] had prayer lines and went through them.
[1:09:14] That's
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; right. Why? Because we're human,
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; right? But people say, "Well, I've been
[1:09:19] caught. I I believe the message. And in
[1:09:21] this maturity of where we are, we don't
[1:09:24] really need emotion anymore. We don't
[1:09:27] really need good services. We don't
[1:09:29] really need the power of God. We don't
[1:09:31] really need those things. What about
[1:09:33] your children?
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; How are they going to be caught?
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; So, I don't need that. You may not.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; I don't need to cry. I don't need I've
[1:09:47] already settled things with God and
[1:09:51] What about your children? I believe we
[1:09:53] all still need it.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; But what about your children? What about
[1:09:56] the young people? How's the next
[1:09:57] generation going to come along?
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; How's it going to happen? It's got to be
[1:10:02] they've got to be attracted to the
[1:10:04] message the same way you were attracted
[1:10:05] to the message.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; There's got to be a reality in their
[1:10:08] lives. There's got they got to see
[1:10:09] something real. Listen, our young people
[1:10:11] are not going to not going to remain in
[1:10:13] the message of the hour and be filled
[1:10:14] with the Holy Ghost because we tell some
[1:10:16] story of something that happened a
[1:10:17] hundred years ago and what our
[1:10:19] forefathers taught. But there's got to
[1:10:21] be a living reality of the unfailing
[1:10:23] presence of God right here in our lives.
[1:10:25] Something that'll grab a hold of us,
[1:10:27] Jaden. Something that'll grab a hold of
[1:10:28] us. Something that'll move us. Some
[1:10:30] that'll make us different because we
[1:10:32] still struggle. Listen to me. If you
[1:10:33] say, "Well, we don't need preaching no
[1:10:35] more." I tell you who does need
[1:10:36] preaching. People that are struggling
[1:10:38] with pornography. People that are
[1:10:40] struggling with with a w with with lust,
[1:10:42] people that are struggling with with
[1:10:44] ungodliness in their life, people that
[1:10:46] are struggling with temper, people that
[1:10:47] are strugging.
[1:10:50] They need the gospel. They need the
[1:10:51] power of God. They need the presence of
[1:10:53] God because they're human beings
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; because of what we were. But God knew
[1:10:58] what kind of bait it would take to
[1:11:00] attract the fish to the place where we
[1:11:02] could receive the word in its fullness.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:11:08] Well, you don't ever do need to do youth
[1:11:10] meetings. You don't need to do anything.
[1:11:11] You don't need no no program for the
[1:11:13] youth. No Sunday school. We'll just
[1:11:15] we'll just leave them alone. Let them
[1:11:17] become what they are. We got a perfect
[1:11:18] word now. They'll become something.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; Will
[1:11:26] see the third pole is not a doctrine.
[1:11:28] It's faith.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; It's a belief.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; It's believing something. It's not
[1:11:34] knowing something. It's believing
[1:11:36] something.
[1:11:39] Brother Brandham had a prayer line, the
[1:11:40] sermon, perfect faith, and he said this
[1:11:43] at at the close of it, he said, "This is
[1:11:45] coming into that third pole." A prayer
[1:11:49] line.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; This is coming into that third pull.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; I'm believing it. He said, "Now, I want
[1:11:56] to ask you a sincere question. You that
[1:11:59] pass through the prayer line, can you
[1:12:01] actually believe and feel now?"
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. that there's something
[1:12:07] happened in you since you've had hands
[1:12:10] laid on you. Raise your hand. He said if
[1:12:13] that's if you believe it, he said, then
[1:12:15] raise your hand. They've come through
[1:12:17] the prayer line, had hands laid on just
[1:12:18] like we do now.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; Just like you would if you come up for
[1:12:21] prayer today or when we have a prayer
[1:12:23] line in the meetings like the brothers
[1:12:24] would pray for you just like where did
[1:12:27] we learn to do that? We learned from a
[1:12:28] prophet,
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; right? To lay hands on the sick and form
[1:12:32] a line and do those things. We learned
[1:12:33] that from a prophet.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And so he said, "If you've had the
[1:12:37] hands laid on you, raise your hand." He
[1:12:39] said, "There it is. This is what we've
[1:12:42] waited for."
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; He said, "Now this is not This is just
[1:12:47] starting to bloom now." He said, "I did
[1:12:50] this for a purpose. I'm working out
[1:12:52] something." See, he said, "It's taking
[1:12:54] this charge of faith and going right
[1:12:56] back to begin and come in." He said,
[1:12:58] "See, to kind of raise faith in a
[1:13:00] bracket where you've never noticed it
[1:13:02] that way before."
[1:13:04] So on our way on the journey to
[1:13:07] perfection of faith, on our journey to
[1:13:10] perfection of maturity, on our journey
[1:13:11] to a body change, we we'll still have
[1:13:14] prayer lives. We'll still have church.
[1:13:15] We'll still we'll still worship God.
[1:13:17] We'll still love God. Why? Because our
[1:13:19] faith needs to be increased. It needs to
[1:13:21] be raised to a point where one morning
[1:13:23] we're going to see a change in our
[1:13:25] bodies.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; See our loved ones begin to come in.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; We still need it.
[1:13:31] And now, brother Brandston, it's just
[1:13:33] starting to bloom. He said, "Not a
[1:13:35] faith, but a perfect faith. Build it up
[1:13:38] in here." And watch a perfect God with a
[1:13:41] perfect heart
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; keep a perfect promise
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; by his perfect word, which I love the
[1:13:47] way the prophet put it. He said, "Which
[1:13:49] is sharper than a two-edged sword and a
[1:13:51] discerner of the thoughts of the heart."
[1:13:53] What we're coming now to the perfection
[1:13:57] because the people has to come to this.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; Yes. to what? To going through a prayer
[1:14:02] line and just believing.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; And in that sermon, Brother Brandham
[1:14:08] said, he said, he said, if you come
[1:14:10] through the prayer line, he said, if you
[1:14:11] had perfect faith, when you come
[1:14:13] through, that hands were laid on you. He
[1:14:14] said, when you leave, you leave shouting
[1:14:16] and rejoicing because you know that God
[1:14:19] did something.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; And not everybody's loud, but
[1:14:23] everybody's can rejoice and thank God
[1:14:25] for what they receive. And so, what he's
[1:14:27] doing, what is he doing? He's showing us
[1:14:29] that perfect faith wasn't going to be
[1:14:31] some esoteric some kind of a a thing out
[1:14:33] there that was unreachable. But he's
[1:14:35] saying well he's saying there there is
[1:14:37] perfect faith that can operate even
[1:14:39] during a prayer line. Are you with me
[1:14:40] now?
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; Even during a prayer line because the
[1:14:43] people can come have hands laid on them
[1:14:45] and believe.
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; If you don't believe the hands are not
[1:14:50] magical.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; Old hands and young hands. Brother
[1:14:55] Brandham called it dirty hands. Come on.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; That's what he called his own hands.
[1:14:59] When he laid them on the people, he
[1:15:00] said, "My own dirty hands."
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; Human hands,
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; Flesh hands on the people. There's
[1:15:07] nothing in the hands.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; But what is the power of it? The power
[1:15:11] of it is God said they'll lay hands on
[1:15:13] the sick and they shall recover. And
[1:15:15] when people believe that and walk
[1:15:16] through prayer line, what are they?
[1:15:18] They're healed. Why? Because of their
[1:15:20] faith in it. They believe it. We're just
[1:15:23] doing what God said to do. We're not
[1:15:25] following what somebody else said to do.
[1:15:26] We're doing what God told us to do.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; So, I think people, you know, you're
[1:15:32] looking for some kind of say, "Well,
[1:15:33] there's something miraculous about the
[1:15:34] prayer line itself." Well, it's very
[1:15:36] natural.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; Yep.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; Right. Ordinary men.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; Natural people. Yes,
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; sir.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; Just very natural. Laying hands. See,
[1:15:43] what what good would that do? What good
[1:15:45] does it do to take communion? Wash your
[1:15:46] feet.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; Right. At some point, we can
[1:15:51] spiritualize all of that. But he told us
[1:15:53] to do it.
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; Why did he tell us to do it? Because
[1:15:56] it's something we can put our faith in.
[1:15:58] He knew we we were human beings.
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; We need something we can put our hands
[1:16:02] on. Something we put our faith in.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; As the little boy said, we need a God
[1:16:05] with skin on him.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; Good.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; So, Brother Brandon said, "We come into
[1:16:10] that perfect raptured faith." He said,
[1:16:12] "That's what's holding it away right now
[1:16:13] is waiting for that church to come into
[1:16:15] that perfect raptured faith looking for
[1:16:17] it." You say, "Well, I got perfect
[1:16:18] raptured faith." Why aren't you
[1:16:19] raptured?
[1:16:22] Come on.
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; Because when we come to that, we'll be
[1:16:25] raptured.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; But the message is bringing us to that.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; He said, "It means a lot of shaving down
[1:16:30] for me. It makes a lot for you, but
[1:16:32] together means a lot for you. But
[1:16:34] together, we'll make it by the grace of
[1:16:35] God." How many believe that today?
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; There'll be a lot of shaving down, a lot
[1:16:39] of unbelief that's got to be stripped
[1:16:40] away. But let me stand there in faith
[1:16:42] and believe. Lord, I believe your word
[1:16:44] is true. I believe my children will be
[1:16:46] saved. I believe things are going to be
[1:16:47] okay.
[1:16:49] Yes.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon said, "I want to get you
[1:16:51] built up now." It's another sermon,
[1:16:53] spiritual food in due season. He said,
[1:16:55] "I want to get you built up now in the
[1:16:56] holy oracles of God in thee." Faith, the
[1:16:58] faith of this hour,
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; the faith. It's going to take more faith
[1:17:02] than ever was in any age.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; For this has to be rapturing faith be
[1:17:05] taken up.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; He said, "So, we want you to believe
[1:17:08] tonight in all." Someone say, "All
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; all that you have seen."
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; Heard the word that you've heard
[1:17:16] preached. the signs and wonders that
[1:17:18] you've seen done. What are we talking
[1:17:20] about? Faith is increased. Faith becomes
[1:17:22] by hearing the word. Faith is increased
[1:17:23] by signs and wonders. What is it? Faith.
[1:17:26] We want you to believe in all. We want
[1:17:27] you to believe in the what you've heard.
[1:17:29] We want you to believe what you've seen.
[1:17:31] We want you to accumulate all that
[1:17:33] together in your heart
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; and consider it whether if that be God
[1:17:37] or not.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; And when you decide that it's God, when
[1:17:41] you proclaim it, oh that's the Lord.
[1:17:43] Listen, then God can move for you
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; in the same way. When you look in the
[1:17:47] scripture and say here, maybe you have a
[1:17:49] a a problem in some way in your body.
[1:17:51] You look at the scripture and see where
[1:17:52] God healed somebody like that. You can
[1:17:54] look at that and say, "I believe that
[1:17:56] was God that did it." And when you
[1:17:58] believe, your faith can be quickened for
[1:17:59] your own healing.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, it works just that way in the
[1:18:02] church. When you see somebody else
[1:18:04] healed, it gives you faith to believe.
[1:18:05] That testimony gives you faith to
[1:18:07] believe. I believe I can be healed. I
[1:18:09] can believe I can be saved.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? Faith is the
[1:18:13] foundation of everything.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; Yes. Nothing works
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; without it.
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; Very good.
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; You got to believe.
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; And perfect faith doesn't come by
[1:18:23] intellectualism. Neither does it come by
[1:18:24] emotionalism.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; Not by workup, but by the message.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; The question is, will I find faith?
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; See, the Pentecostals had faith. And you
[1:18:34] might say, "Well, brother Ben, the
[1:18:35] Pentecostals had faith." Sure they did.
[1:18:37] But they didn't have mustard seed faith.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; Remember the apostles said to the Lord,
[1:18:42] "Increase our faith." Luke 17:5, the
[1:18:45] Lord said, "If you had faith as a grain
[1:18:47] of mustard seed,
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; come on."
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; You might say, "This sack of my tree, be
[1:18:50] thou plucked up by the root, be thou
[1:18:51] planted in the sea, and it should obey
[1:18:52] you,
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; church, I don't think we recognize what
[1:18:57] happened in our day."
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; Look,
[1:19:00] he said, "If you had mustard seed faith,
[1:19:03] identifies that as pure faith, it can't
[1:19:04] be mixed."
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; If you had a pure word producing a pure
[1:19:09] faith,
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; are you with me now?
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; Right. But what happened in our day was
[1:19:13] a restoration of the purity of the word.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; And what happened during that time?
[1:19:20] Brother Brandham spoke
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; to the psychamine tree,
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; if you will, to the little fish,
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; right? But why did he do that? Why tell
[1:19:29] about a little fish being restored to
[1:19:30] life?
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; What's the point of that? It's showing
[1:19:34] us that the mustard seed faith was back.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come on.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. See, if you had mustard seed
[1:19:41] faith, the original restored unmixed
[1:19:43] faith, the spoken word would be in
[1:19:44] operation. And so God showed us in
[1:19:46] operation. Now, what happened in our
[1:19:48] day? God identified the third pole as
[1:19:50] the spoken word and the open book.
[1:19:52] Opening of the book was the
[1:19:53] manifestation of sons back to an Eden
[1:19:55] condition where Adam could speak to the
[1:19:58] tree and tell it to move and it would
[1:19:59] move,
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; right? He could speak and children would
[1:20:02] come. He could speak and all those
[1:20:03] things would happen. But he fell and
[1:20:06] took uh the permissive will of God,
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; right? Went out with his wife to save
[1:20:10] his wife
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; and and that way the the attributes of
[1:20:13] God could be expressed. But yet we're
[1:20:15] coming back. So what is this message?
[1:20:17] It's the restoration of the
[1:20:19] manifestation of sons back to an Eden
[1:20:22] condition.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; So you know, I know people would will
[1:20:25] hear that and I know this is heavy and
[1:20:27] deep this morning. So you just grab a
[1:20:29] hold of what you can. Again, it's not
[1:20:30] important so much what we understand,
[1:20:32] but what we believe,
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; right? But but if you can understand
[1:20:35] this morning that the we're we're the
[1:20:38] this message took us back to that and
[1:20:41] then your next question might be well I
[1:20:43] spoke to my refrigerator and it didn't
[1:20:44] open.
[1:20:47] There was no more milk there than it was
[1:20:49] before. What happened? Right? You might
[1:20:52] say well I you know I went down I know
[1:20:54] people who kind of took this and they
[1:20:55] said well I'll just start speaking to
[1:20:56] things. They were always talking about
[1:20:58] you know brother Brandon had one fish
[1:20:59] and they had 15 you know and and stuff
[1:21:02] like that. Now, I'm not mocking that God
[1:21:04] could do that. We believe in the spoken
[1:21:06] word, but the word was manifested in
[1:21:08] that way for a reason,
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; right? It wasn't just random,
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; but it was done for a reason. Why aren't
[1:21:14] we just speaking everything in our
[1:21:16] lives?
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; We don't have the character yet
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; to handle that.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; But there is something that we'll speak.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; I hope you're hearing me now.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; I want to get into this and I don't know
[1:21:28] if I'll have time to finish this today.
[1:21:29] If I don't, I'll pick it up after the
[1:21:30] meetings. But so we aren't speaking
[1:21:34] everything. We're just speaking what
[1:21:37] we're inspired to speak.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; So brother Brandham has asked the
[1:21:41] question because somebody realized that
[1:21:42] hey brother Brandham was able to speak
[1:21:44] the word. You know this Christian life
[1:21:46] is a little bit hard. You know it's
[1:21:47] difficult to be an overcomer. But
[1:21:49] brother Brandham if you have the spoken
[1:21:51] word what if you could just speak us
[1:21:53] into a rapture condition.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; Right? They asked him that question.
[1:21:57] They said, "It seems entirely possible
[1:21:59] for you to speak the word and one would
[1:22:01] be completely and fully restored, placed
[1:22:03] entirely ready for the rapture and the
[1:22:05] resurrection, the son of man. This is so
[1:22:07] or is it not?" And you would do this if
[1:22:09] properly pressed upon, would you not?
[1:22:12] Right? So they said, "Well, is it true
[1:22:15] that you could do it?" Brother Random
[1:22:17] acknowledges, they reference Luke 21:36,
[1:22:19] "You escape all these things that should
[1:22:21] come to pass, stand before the son of
[1:22:22] man." They were they like, "Well, hey,
[1:22:24] there's an easy way,
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; right? All right, brother Brandham could
[1:22:27] just speak and we could be ready for a
[1:22:30] rapture. No more praying. No more
[1:22:32] calling out to God. Are you with me now?
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, church.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; People still think that. But but it's an
[1:22:40] overcoming, an individual overcoming in
[1:22:42] our lives.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; Right. But brother Brandham didn't
[1:22:44] discount it. In fact, he said that
[1:22:46] that's true. It's possible.
[1:22:49] Right. But then he explains it. He
[1:22:52] rephrases the question.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah. He says, not polishing up what you
[1:22:55] said, but making it a little clearer. He
[1:22:57] said, because of the spoken words and
[1:22:58] things like that, he said about all of
[1:22:59] you here witness to squirrels and all
[1:23:01] these other things that's been done. But
[1:23:03] did you notice that was sovereignly
[1:23:05] given? I never asked him, Lord, let me
[1:23:07] do this, speak these things in like
[1:23:08] that, do these things there. I never
[1:23:11] asked him that. He by his own divine
[1:23:13] will came to me and said, you go do
[1:23:16] this.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; He said, I wasn't asking one thing about
[1:23:20] it. Moses never asked to go down to
[1:23:21] Egypt, but it was God that sent him down
[1:23:23] to Egypt.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; So, Brother Brandham taught us that the
[1:23:26] spoken word operated by the inspiration
[1:23:29] of God.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; And he said it was when the people would
[1:23:32] say the right thing and then it would
[1:23:33] operate.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; But you remember all the spoken word
[1:23:36] that Brother Brandham spoke, the the
[1:23:37] different times that he spoke the word,
[1:23:40] every time it was God inspiring, maybe
[1:23:43] somebody would say the right thing and
[1:23:45] then a prophet would speak it, right?
[1:23:48] And then the person would be healed or
[1:23:49] the fish would be raised or the
[1:23:51] squirrels would be in their place.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; But then watch what happens now when it
[1:23:57] come to Hattie. Right.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; There was a difference.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; Right. It didn't operate the same way.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; Because now it was she said the right
[1:24:07] thing. Brother Brandham spoke it. But
[1:24:10] that wasn't the end of it.
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandon said that's the
[1:24:15] first time it operated on a human being.
[1:24:17] in a human being was had he right.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; Why? Because it wasn't brother Brandham
[1:24:24] speaking her kids back.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; Come on. That's
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; He preached the message that made it
[1:24:31] possible.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; There was an atmosphere there that made
[1:24:33] it possible. It was a prophet of God
[1:24:35] standing there and said, "Speak what you
[1:24:36] will."
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; Oh, I hope you're hearing me today. It
[1:24:39] wasn't a prophet of God standing there
[1:24:40] and saying, "Now, your sons are going to
[1:24:42] be he going to be saved or your sister's
[1:24:44] going to be healed." But what was it? It
[1:24:46] was her. Yeah,
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; it was in the heart of Hattie right
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; because he finally got somebody. Brother
[1:24:51] Br said it came from a poor widow
[1:24:53] woman's heart.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; God knowing that she'd asked the
[1:24:58] greatest thing could be done. Don't you
[1:25:00] realize what God's doing in this hour.
[1:25:02] The prophets already spoke the message.
[1:25:04] We've already said the right thing. Said
[1:25:06] we believe it. The prophet's already
[1:25:07] spoken. Now what are we waiting on?
[1:25:09] There's got to come an inspiration in us
[1:25:11] to ask for the right thing. Yes,
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; sir.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; Oh my. There has to be a bride who ask
[1:25:16] for the right thing. And so Jesus comes
[1:25:18] down and said, "Will I find faith?"
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; Like Hattie Wright had.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; Good.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; She was a widow.
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So here's Luke 18. Jesus is
[1:25:34] coming down and he's telling the story
[1:25:36] of the unjust judge. Remember, it's an
[1:25:39] extreme example.
[1:25:41] Here's a widow. Here's an unjust judge.
[1:25:44] Here's a widow with no property rights,
[1:25:48] she her case is not valid in court,
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; but because she just complains.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; She just keeps coming.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; Every Monday when he shows up to work,
[1:26:01] she's knocking on the door.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; If they had telephone back in, she'd be
[1:26:04] calling every five minutes.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; Judge, you need to do something about my
[1:26:08] situation.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:26:12] And so in Luke 18:6, they said, "The
[1:26:15] Lord said, "Hear what the unjust judge
[1:26:16] says."
[1:26:18] Listen, the judge, what did he say? He
[1:26:20] said, "She's I'm not going to give her
[1:26:21] this on the merits of her case, but
[1:26:24] because she keeps coming and asking."
[1:26:27] So, she didn't ask for the right thing
[1:26:29] necessarily,
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; but it was just out of opportunity. It's
[1:26:33] the word that that's used in the
[1:26:34] scripture. In other words, it's just out
[1:26:36] of her coming over and over and over
[1:26:38] again.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; Right? So now think with me through
[1:26:43] this. He said, "And shall not God
[1:26:44] avenge." He said, "Hear what the unjust
[1:26:46] judge sayeth. Shall not God avenge his
[1:26:47] own elect which cry day and night unto
[1:26:49] him? Though he bear long with them?"
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; He said, "I tell you, he will avenge
[1:26:54] them speedily. Nevertheless, when the
[1:26:56] Son of man cometh, shall he find faith
[1:26:58] on the earth." Now, what was she crying
[1:26:59] for? She was a widow crying for her
[1:27:02] rights as a widow.
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; Yes. Right.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; Right. But she was still a widow.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; When the judge gave her the the request,
[1:27:10] she was still a widow. And so I think
[1:27:13] that might be a tight if you think about
[1:27:15] it like this of the rain falling on the
[1:27:17] just and the unjust. Like Jesus uses
[1:27:19] this extreme example that there's a
[1:27:20] widow who has no rights. Here's a judge
[1:27:23] who is not just
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; and she's still got what she asked for.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; But you're not going you're not a widow
[1:27:30] going to an unjust judge. You're the
[1:27:33] bride going to the king.
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; So, how much more
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; would he avenge the elect or give them
[1:27:42] what they asked for?
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; If they would ask, if they would cry.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; So, she would be basically given the
[1:27:48] right to glean, which was the widow's
[1:27:49] rights in that day, maybe to live on the
[1:27:51] property because that's all the
[1:27:53] potential that she had. She did not have
[1:27:56] the potential of redemption. No longer
[1:27:58] having the ability to bear children.
[1:28:00] perhaps an older woman. She didn't have
[1:28:02] the didn't have the ability to bear
[1:28:03] children or the potential to become
[1:28:06] maybe uh to to be redeemed and so she
[1:28:09] just got what she asked for. That still
[1:28:11] works even on the just and the unjust.
[1:28:14] Many times even a a sinner will ask for
[1:28:17] something and get it because they
[1:28:19] believe
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; because they have faith. And Christians
[1:28:21] sometimes are because of condemnation
[1:28:24] they they don't believe like they
[1:28:25] should. And a sinner don't know any
[1:28:27] better than just to believe and they'll
[1:28:28] receive it. That's
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; right. Right? So we that's why we pray
[1:28:30] for healing even for sinners.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; Right? But we pray that they would first
[1:28:35] be saved
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; and come to Christ. But we do pray for
[1:28:39] healing for sinners. And God will heal a
[1:28:40] sinner.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; Even in their sin,
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; he absolutely will.
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; And yet because it's based on faith.
[1:28:49] See, Matthew 7:7 tells us, "Ask and it
[1:28:51] shall be given you. Seek you shall find.
[1:28:53] Knock and it shall be open unto you. For
[1:28:55] everyone that askketh receiveth. He that
[1:28:56] seeketh findeth. To him that knockketh
[1:28:58] it shall be open. That's not limited to
[1:29:01] the elect, but it does work for the
[1:29:04] elect.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; Right. Brother said they've never been
[1:29:07] able to scientifically find a better way
[1:29:09] for a baby to get what he wants besides
[1:29:11] crying for it.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; You know, they can't educate him to
[1:29:15] grunt.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; Well, it would make it a lot easier back
[1:29:21] in the nursery, wouldn't it? They'd just
[1:29:22] go, "Oh, he wants to be fed." You know?
[1:29:27] But I don't know about your kids, but I
[1:29:28] remember my kids, they screamed,
[1:29:30] especially Esther. Esther screamed
[1:29:33] constantly.
[1:29:36] And And it just like I I got stopped one
[1:29:38] time, one one or two o'clock in the
[1:29:40] morning. We were going through Donovan,
[1:29:42] Missouri, coming home from church at
[1:29:43] Brother Ivy's before we moved over
[1:29:45] there. We were coming home from church
[1:29:46] and that little girl was screaming in
[1:29:48] the back seat and I got stopped going
[1:29:50] through that town going about 15 miles
[1:29:52] over the speed limit because I wanted to
[1:29:53] get home.
[1:29:56] And the policeman walked up to the door
[1:29:57] and he opened the window and he heard
[1:30:00] that screaming. He said, "Y'all slow
[1:30:02] down. Have a nice night." And walked
[1:30:03] away.
[1:30:07] Evidently, he had children.
[1:30:11] But you know what? She got what she
[1:30:13] wanted. That's the only way she knew.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? It's the only way.
[1:30:17] God never had a better way for
[1:30:19] Christians, for believers to get what
[1:30:21] they desire than to ask for it,
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; cry for it.
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; All right?
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; He said they can't educate him to grunt.
[1:30:27] And they can't educate him to talk that
[1:30:29] quick. But you know how he gets it? He
[1:30:31] just takes God's provided way for it.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; He cries for it, yells and kicks and
[1:30:36] screams till he gets it.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; Good.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; Again, brother said, a man get up on say
[1:30:42] chew his chewing gum real well and said,
[1:30:44] you know, father, I'm here tonight. If
[1:30:46] you want to give me the Holy Ghost, all
[1:30:47] right, I'm here. If you want to heal me,
[1:30:49] I'm sitting here. But if you don't, why?
[1:30:51] All right. It's your will, Lord.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; We do that way too many times.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; He said he's done wrote the will out
[1:30:57] here in the Bible.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; This is your will.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; This is his will right here. But you
[1:31:03] say, "If you want me to have it, I'll
[1:31:04] have it. But nevertheless, if you don't,
[1:31:06] well, it's all right." He said, "You'll
[1:31:07] never get nowhere."
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; But let that one get there and cry out
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; like Buddy Robinson. He stopped in the
[1:31:14] middle of the cornfield. He tied up his
[1:31:16] mule. And Lord, if you don't give me the
[1:31:18] Holy Ghost, when you come back, you'll
[1:31:19] find a pile of bones laying right here.
[1:31:21] I'm going to stay here till I get it.
[1:31:23] That's business. Listen to me, church.
[1:31:24] If we could get down to business with
[1:31:26] God and say, "Lord, I'm going to receive
[1:31:28] the Holy Ghost. I'm going to receive
[1:31:30] salvation. I'm going to receive my
[1:31:32] healing. If we could ever get down to
[1:31:33] business like with God like that, things
[1:31:35] would change."
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; The effectual fervent prayer of a
[1:31:39] righteous man avaleth much.
[1:31:41] Brother said, "God always recommends to
[1:31:43] his people, his believing children, to
[1:31:45] always go in his provided way." Someone
[1:31:48] say, "Always."
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; Always.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; That don't change, church, because we're
[1:31:52] elect. Well, I'm caught. I'm a rainbow
[1:31:53] trout. I'm elect. But it don't change.
[1:31:55] You still need to be in Holy Ghost
[1:31:57] services. You still need to cry out to
[1:31:59] him. You still need to ask him for what
[1:32:01] you have need of.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said, "Peter, if that's
[1:32:08] God's idea, he wants you to cry out."
[1:32:09] Peter started out walking on the water.
[1:32:11] He thought he was getting along. All
[1:32:12] right, sir.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; See how big I'm doing.
[1:32:16] I This is almost an allegory for the
[1:32:18] Christian faith. You know, all of us do
[1:32:19] that. You know, we start out, oh, I got
[1:32:22] saved. I got filled with the Holy Ghost.
[1:32:23] I went to camp, these young people, and
[1:32:25] I felt so good. Here you go, walking on
[1:32:27] the water.
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; And then you get to looking at the
[1:32:30] waves.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; That's a big one.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; Somebody says something about you,
[1:32:35] somebody does something wrong to you,
[1:32:37] hurt your feelings.
[1:32:40] You get sick. You get hurt.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; Preacher hurt. Church hurt.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; He said, "Well, I'm just there's too
[1:32:48] many ways."
[1:32:50] He said he started sinking.
[1:32:53] He didn't say, "Well, I guess it
[1:32:55] failed."
[1:32:58] See, we look at the faith of Peter while
[1:32:59] he's walking on the water and then we
[1:33:00] look at him as a failure. Peter wasn't a
[1:33:03] failure because he sunk in the water.
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; Because he didn't stay there.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:08] Come on, church. You might have made
[1:33:10] some mistakes. You might have had a
[1:33:11] past. You might have been through some
[1:33:12] things, but you didn't stay there.
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; Peter was walking on the water one day
[1:33:16] and he sucked just like any mortal man
[1:33:18] would sink because he lost his faith.
[1:33:21] But in that moment, he didn't stay
[1:33:22] there, but he cried out, "Lord, save
[1:33:24] me."
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; And that eternal hand reached down and
[1:33:27] picked him up again. I believe that
[1:33:29] eternal hand is right here this morning
[1:33:31] to pick that up you up and reach down
[1:33:33] into your situation. He's still here
[1:33:36] this morning to do the same thing. You
[1:33:37] don't say, "Well, I guess it failed."
[1:33:39] But reached right down. He cried out,
[1:33:41] "Lord, save me." That eternal hand
[1:33:42] reached down and picked him up again.
[1:33:44] Why? He cried out.
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm so thankful. We can still cry
[1:33:48] out this morning.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; Believe his word.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; He said, "God recommends this way also
[1:33:54] to his baby children to cry, his
[1:33:56] believers to cry for what they want."
[1:33:58] That's right. Cry for him for your
[1:33:59] needs. He said, "Don't listen to
[1:34:01] intellectual speeches." Somebody say,
[1:34:03] "Well, now I tell you this baptism of
[1:34:05] the Holy Spirit, they talk about this
[1:34:06] divine healing, that kind of stuff." I
[1:34:07] tell you, it isn't today. I can explain
[1:34:09] it. That's not for today. Listen, a real
[1:34:11] genuine baby of God won't pay no
[1:34:13] attention to that. He will scream and
[1:34:15] yell and kick up his heels until he gets
[1:34:16] a vindicated answer back from the
[1:34:18] promise of God's word.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; Man don't live by bread alone, but by
[1:34:22] every word that comes out of the mouth
[1:34:23] of God proceeds from the mouth of God.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; He said he cries and cries till that
[1:34:28] word of promise is vindicated.
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:34:31] Huh? Don't give up. If there's something
[1:34:33] in your heart, you want to see a
[1:34:34] salvation. Maybe somebody you've went to
[1:34:36] church with, somebody you love, you want
[1:34:38] to see that, don't give up. Cry out for
[1:34:40] it.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; Until the word of promise is vindicated.
[1:34:46] I love our children because they have
[1:34:47] the faith to come to the altar. If they
[1:34:48] don't get what they're looking for, come
[1:34:50] again. They'll come again. Come again.
[1:34:51] What is it, church? I I don't criticize
[1:34:53] them for that. It's because they have
[1:34:55] faith to believe God, you're going to do
[1:34:56] it. If you didn't do it last time,
[1:34:58] you'll do it now. They're not jaded by
[1:35:00] the past and and burn over and hardened
[1:35:02] by circumstances, but they're tender to
[1:35:04] the things of God. We all ought to be
[1:35:06] that way. If we got a need, let's ask
[1:35:08] for it.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; Talk to God about it.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Said he lives on what the Lord
[1:35:17] says for him to live by and he stays
[1:35:19] there until it happens. Cries, kicks up
[1:35:22] his heels, and just stays at it.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; But there got to be something in you to
[1:35:27] do that. something in the elect to cry
[1:35:28] for the right thing.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; Like there was in Hatty, right?
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; To ask for the right thing, to speak the
[1:35:34] word for the right thing. See, Luther
[1:35:37] cried out for justification. Wesley for
[1:35:39] sanctification. Pentecost for gifts. But
[1:35:42] our cry is for rapturing faith.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; See, we want we we want those things. We
[1:35:48] want we must have justification. We must
[1:35:50] have sanctification. But oh God, in this
[1:35:53] day, the my heart's desire and I believe
[1:35:55] yours is as well. I Lord, I want to see
[1:35:57] a body change.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; There's got to be a bride who gets so
[1:36:01] hungry and so thirsty for the things of
[1:36:03] God. Say, Lord, I I'm not satisfied with
[1:36:05] just signs anymore. I'm not satisfied
[1:36:07] with I believe in signs. I believe in
[1:36:09] signs of your presence, but I want you.
[1:36:11] I want to be in your presence. I want to
[1:36:13] be there.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; I want my body to be changed.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; So, our focus in this day is our hunger
[1:36:19] and thirst. After the open book, after
[1:36:21] the message of the hour, the quickened
[1:36:23] word in our day, this widow cried for
[1:36:25] her property and received it. But she
[1:36:28] was still a widow. But there's a people
[1:36:30] who will not be a widow,
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; will be a bride.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; Good.
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; In 2 Kings chapter 8, there's another
[1:36:39] widow spoken of, and it's this widow is
[1:36:42] actually the Shounomite woman. You
[1:36:43] remember the story that how she Elisha
[1:36:46] uh come to her and and they couldn't
[1:36:48] have children and then her her son was
[1:36:51] born and then the son died and Elisha
[1:36:54] she come running to Elisha and and he
[1:36:56] said the Lord's hid from me what's wrong
[1:36:58] and she come up to him he said is
[1:36:59] everything okay and she said all is well
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; but you know when you go through
[1:37:06] something it don't mean you'll never go
[1:37:07] through anything else
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; that's right
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; right there'll always be trials and
[1:37:11] trouble
[1:37:13] And in 2 Kings chapter 8, this
[1:37:14] Shounamite woman and her son actually
[1:37:18] were in a condition where they had to
[1:37:20] leave the land because of a famine. It
[1:37:23] came to pass and and Elijah Elisha warns
[1:37:25] them to leave the land and come back
[1:37:27] after a certain number of years. And so
[1:37:29] it came to pass after seven years, seven
[1:37:31] years in that the woman returned out of
[1:37:33] the land of the Philistine. And she went
[1:37:35] forth to cry to the king for her house
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; and for her land.
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:37:42] Now evidently her husband had passed
[1:37:44] away or he would have been the one
[1:37:47] asking but now she was a widow.
[1:37:50] Look now the king talked with Ghesi the
[1:37:54] servant of the man of God saying tell me
[1:37:56] I pray thee all the great things that
[1:37:57] Elisha done. So as she is coming to ask
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; the mind of the king has already been
[1:38:03] placed on her situation.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; I love that. And it came to pass as he
[1:38:09] was telling the king how he had restored
[1:38:10] a dead body to life. Behold the woman
[1:38:12] whose son he had restored to life cried
[1:38:15] to the king for her house and for her
[1:38:17] land. And Gaza said, "My lord, oh king,
[1:38:20] this is the woman,
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; and this is her son whom Elisha restored
[1:38:24] to life."
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; When the king asked the woman, she told
[1:38:27] him. So the king appointed unto her a
[1:38:30] certain officer,
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; sir. Glory to God. Saying, "Restore all
[1:38:34] that was hers and all the fruits of the
[1:38:37] field since the day that she left the
[1:38:39] land even until now."
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; So with her, there would be a more
[1:38:44] complete restoration
[1:38:46] because she would not just receive a
[1:38:47] widow's portion, but she had a son who
[1:38:50] could inherit. So she would receive a
[1:38:52] greater portion of the inheritance. He
[1:38:54] said, "Restore all that was hers.
[1:38:56] restore all the fruits of the field, all
[1:38:58] the gifts of the spirit, all of these
[1:39:00] things back to her, sir.
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; She had more standing than the other
[1:39:05] widow because she had a son who could
[1:39:06] inherit. She wasn't coming before an
[1:39:08] unjust judge. She was coming before a
[1:39:10] king.
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; You see the contrast?
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; She could not inherit, but the property
[1:39:14] would be passed to her son.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; Very good.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; But now when she got done, she'd still
[1:39:18] be a widow,
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:39:22] I I think you could look at that and
[1:39:23] say, "Well, that's like the church age
[1:39:25] believer, right? She It's not time yet."
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; Now, look, her potential is limited
[1:39:34] because she can cry for what she has a
[1:39:35] right to, what her son has a right to,
[1:39:37] but perhaps she's too old to have any
[1:39:39] more children. But there's a couple
[1:39:42] other widows that are spoken of in the
[1:39:43] scripture I want to look at this morning
[1:39:44] just briefly before we close. And
[1:39:46] they're named Naomi and Ruth. Yeah.
[1:39:49] Right. You've heard the story. Hey,
[1:39:50] homiey's a Jewish widow with the same
[1:39:52] rights as any other widow, right? But
[1:39:55] Ruth is a Moabitis.
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; Now, she is in worse condition than any
[1:40:03] of these other widows cuz she's not.
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; She doesn't have natural rights herself.
[1:40:08] She's not even a Jew.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; She's not even an Israelite.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; But she was married to
[1:40:15] a backsliding believer.
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; But that marriage has ended. Her old
[1:40:19] husband is dead.
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; She is marriage material.
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And she has the potential to
[1:40:28] bear children. And the Bible tells us in
[1:40:30] Ruth 2:3 that she went and gleaned in
[1:40:32] the field after the reapers. That's what
[1:40:34] a widow would do.
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; And she happened to light on a part of
[1:40:37] the field belonging to Boaz who was of
[1:40:38] the kindred ofc. And Boaz takes notice
[1:40:41] of her. There had perhaps been many
[1:40:44] widows in his fields,
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; but he noticed her because he saw her
[1:40:48] character.
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; He told her that later. He said, "I've
[1:40:50] seen the way you did. I've seen what you
[1:40:52] how you followed and how you how you
[1:40:54] helped Naomi and how you stayed with the
[1:40:56] word."
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; And so he notices her and he tells her,
[1:41:01] "Stay in my field." And he instructs his
[1:41:03] servants to drop handfuls on purpose.
[1:41:05] You remember
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; brother Brandon said that was that
[1:41:08] little that re revelation that he
[1:41:09] dropped from time to time.
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; And finally the time came for wheat
[1:41:14] harvest. Remember Ruth came in the field
[1:41:17] into the land at the time of barley
[1:41:19] harvest.
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; But the time now had come for the wheat
[1:41:22] harvest.
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; And at the time of the wheat harvest,
[1:41:25] there would be a threshing floor and a
[1:41:27] place where the tears and the wheat were
[1:41:29] separated.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:41:32] And so I'm just telling it to you to
[1:41:35] save time this morning. We could go read
[1:41:36] it all, but
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; she was instructed by Naomi at that
[1:41:40] time,
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; at the time of the latter rain, at the
[1:41:42] time of the wheat harvest, and
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; at the time, oh my, when the sun was at
[1:41:47] his full street, she was instructed, "Go
[1:41:49] down to the threshing floor and submit
[1:41:51] yourself to Boaz."
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says it came to pass at
[1:41:56] midnight that the man was afraid. So he
[1:41:59] just wakes up in his sleep. You know how
[1:42:01] you feel like somebody's in the room?
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; And he turned himself, and behold, a
[1:42:05] woman lay at his feet.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Who art thou?" And she
[1:42:10] answered, "I am Ruth, thine handmmaid."
[1:42:12] And she asked for a remarkable thing.
[1:42:14] Yes,
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; sir.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; She said, "Spread therefore thy skirt
[1:42:18] over thine handmmaid, for thou art a
[1:42:21] near kinsman."
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; She was asking him to marry her. Yes,
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; now. Don't you girls get any ideas here?
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; I It's a man man that should ask, right?
[1:42:38] But look at Ruth. She has such a desire
[1:42:41] and she's been instructed by Naomi
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; to go lay herself down in the most
[1:42:45] vulnerable position she could be in.
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; Because if he rejects her, she'll be a a
[1:42:51] an ill woman, a a woman of ill faith.
[1:42:54] what she did would have been wrong
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; with anyone but her husband.
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; Listen, you weren't meant to submit to
[1:43:02] pastors and preachers, and you weren't
[1:43:04] meant to submit to men. You were meant
[1:43:06] to submit to the word.
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; To lay yourself down, say, "Well, my
[1:43:10] pastor's my husband. This one's my
[1:43:11] husband. This is the one I believe in.
[1:43:13] This is the This is my absolute." To lay
[1:43:15] yourself down to any man would be a
[1:43:17] would be a would be actually committing
[1:43:20] adultery
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; on him. Come on now.
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; She laid herself down there and she
[1:43:25] said, "Spread your skirt for you're a
[1:43:27] near kinsman. You can redeem me."
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. You
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; cover me with your presence,
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; sir.
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; So, what what am I saying now? Here was
[1:43:36] a widow with potential to have children,
[1:43:38] and she said she cried out to the her
[1:43:41] husband,
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; not to an unjust judge,
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; not even to a king,
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; but to her husband,
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; the one who would be her husband. And
[1:43:49] she cried out,
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; "Spread your skirt over me. Give me the
[1:43:53] baptism of the Holy Ghost."
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; Cuz I know you're the only one that can
[1:43:58] redeem me.
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; So he says, "Will I find faith?"
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; In other words, will the message be will
[1:44:05] it happen? Will Malachi 4 happen? Will
[1:44:07] faith be restored where a bride could
[1:44:10] lay themselves down at the foot of the
[1:44:12] word?
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; I hope hope I'm not making it too
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; opaque for you this morning. And I want
[1:44:19] you to be able to see.
[1:44:21] I want you to be able to see what I'm
[1:44:23] saying. Listen, it's not we lay
[1:44:25] ourselves down at his feet and we're
[1:44:26] we're we may we were a widow. Our old
[1:44:29] husband's dead, but but we got a new
[1:44:31] husband. We got somebody who will redeem
[1:44:33] us. And we were not meant to submit to
[1:44:35] any other thing. We were only meant to
[1:44:36] submit to the word.
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; So she says, "Give me the Holy Ghost.
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; Marry me."
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; She asked for the right thing.
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; She didn't come crying for money.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; Right. She didn't come crying. I know,
[1:44:51] but Joel's getting tired. It's time to
[1:44:52] time to go eat. But listen to me for
[1:44:55] just a minute. It isn't time. She didn't
[1:44:58] cry out for money. This isn't the time
[1:44:59] to cry out just for gifts.
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; Listen to me, church. We want him.
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; Gifts come with him.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; Revival comes with him. We are not
[1:45:08] crying out just for good services. We
[1:45:10] want the word.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; We want him. Yes,
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; sir.
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:17] Give me the Holy Ghost. I want you. I
[1:45:19] want the personal the the the the life
[1:45:21] of Jesus Christ on the inside of me. I
[1:45:24] don't want just what Pentecost had. I
[1:45:26] don't want just what Luther had. I want
[1:45:28] the word. I want the fullness. Give me
[1:45:30] life.
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; She didn't ask him for what he had. She
[1:45:38] asked him for him.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; Her focus was not on gifts or trinkets.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; It was solely on Boaz. Right.
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; He sent Ruth home to rest,
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; goes to the gate of the city
[1:45:52] to make his claim.
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; I was told one time, never have a vote
[1:45:56] on anything that you're not sure of the
[1:45:58] outcome. Somehow she had the faith to be
[1:46:02] sure that Boaz would answer her prayer,
[1:46:07] that he would give her all of him.
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; Are you with Benel?
[1:46:13] He goes to the gate of the city
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; and after he gets done, you remember the
[1:46:16] story how the there was one the nearer
[1:46:18] kinsman had to reject his claim.
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; And here come that one uh and he said,
[1:46:23] "I can't take it." Cuz remember what
[1:46:25] what Boaz told him? He said, "I'll
[1:46:27] redeem Naomi." But boy said, "To get
[1:46:28] Naomi, you got to marry Ruth."
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; And the devil said,
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; "I can't do that."
[1:46:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; The devil said, "I can't redeem her."
[1:46:40] Listen, you had drugs and alcohol and
[1:46:43] and all kinds of things of the world,
[1:46:45] but that they couldn't redeem you.
[1:46:47] Denomination couldn't redeem you. But
[1:46:49] this message is not about a man. It's
[1:46:51] not about a church. It's not about a
[1:46:53] preacher. It's about the Christ of Boaz
[1:46:55] who came down in our day and said, "I'm
[1:46:57] going to give you the Holy Ghost. I'm
[1:46:58] going to fill you with my presence. I'm
[1:47:00] going to restore a faith in you
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; that you can ask for me."
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen.
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; Boy, I said to the elders, to all the
[1:47:11] people, you are witnesses this day. I
[1:47:13] have bought all that was Ic all that was
[1:47:15] chilons and mealons of the hand of
[1:47:17] Naomi. So that was Naomi's husband, her
[1:47:20] two sons.
[1:47:22] Naomi could live there, but she couldn't
[1:47:24] inherit.
[1:47:26] She was just a widow. The Jewish church
[1:47:28] would never be the bride.
[1:47:32] But it would actually be the bride who
[1:47:34] comes
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; who lays herself down at the feet of the
[1:47:38] word that will cause the Jewish church
[1:47:40] to come to salvation.
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; The Jewish believer to come to
[1:47:44] salvation. Look, the Jewish people could
[1:47:46] never do that. They didn't have that
[1:47:47] potential, but the bride did.
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; He said, "Moreover, Ruth the Moabitis,
[1:47:54] the wife of Melon, have I purchased to
[1:47:56] be my wife." You realize that's what
[1:47:59] he's done for you today. To raise up the
[1:48:01] name of the dead upon his inheritance
[1:48:02] that the name of the dead be not cut off
[1:48:04] from among his brethren and from the
[1:48:05] gate of his place. You are witnesses
[1:48:07] this day. Listen, she wasn't a widow no
[1:48:09] more when he married her. When he took
[1:48:11] her and married, her name was no longer
[1:48:13] Ruth the Moabitas. Ruth the widow. She
[1:48:15] was Ruth the wife of Boaz.
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; And her cry was a cry of maturity.
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; Redeem me.
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:48:28] And that act of redemption become
[1:48:30] complete.
[1:48:32] We know it was complete because the
[1:48:34] marriage produced a son.
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; It produced a change of her body. And
[1:48:40] Boaz took Ruth and she was his wife. And
[1:48:42] when he went into unto her, the Lord
[1:48:44] gave her conception and she bare a son.
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; So I want to ask you today, will he find
[1:48:51] faith? So you can say it this way. Will
[1:48:54] there be an air? Will there be a
[1:48:56] rapture?
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; The rapture depends on there being a
[1:48:59] people that have faith for it.
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; We've already read that.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; So, there has to be a people with
[1:49:05] rapturing faith. Will that happen?
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon Mate distills that so
[1:49:09] simply. Will Malachi 4 be fulfilled?
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; So, if we see Malachi 4 has been
[1:49:17] fulfilled, Revelation 10:7 has been
[1:49:19] fulfilled, Luke 17:30 has been
[1:49:21] fulfilled, what can we believe today?
[1:49:23] What can we believe about our Boaz? We
[1:49:25] can believe that he's led us right to
[1:49:27] our husband. We can believe there will
[1:49:29] be an air. We can believe there will be
[1:49:31] a body change.
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; The answer is emphatically yes.
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; There will be someone cry out for the
[1:49:39] right thing.
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; If there's been a secret wedding taking
[1:49:42] place
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; right here, brother said the wedding
[1:49:45] takes place here. We go to the wedding
[1:49:46] supper. But there are people on the
[1:49:48] earth manifesting the fullness of
[1:49:51] redemption. If there was an Elijah, a
[1:49:53] vindicated prophet, there must be a
[1:49:55] bride.
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; Listen, for Hadty Wright's miracle to
[1:49:58] work,
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; there had to be a voice of a prophet,
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; and there had to be the voice of a widow
[1:50:03] woman.
[1:50:05] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:50:07] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. That ought to sir.
[1:50:11] &gt;&gt; God wants to hear our voice
[1:50:13] &gt;&gt; speaking the word back to him. I believe
[1:50:15] I'm saved. I believe I'm healed. I
[1:50:17] believe I'm the bride. Amen.
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; Not just the prophet speaking the
[1:50:21] message, but us speaking it back. Not
[1:50:23] something different, but the same
[1:50:24] message he brought.
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon said, "He will be God's
[1:50:29] mouthpiece, speaking of the prophet, and
[1:50:31] he, as it declared in Malachi 4:6, will
[1:50:33] turn the hearts of the children back to
[1:50:35] the fathers. He will bring back the
[1:50:37] elect of the last day, and they will
[1:50:39] hear a vindicated prophet, give the
[1:50:41] exact truth as it was with Paul. He will
[1:50:43] restore the truth as they had it. And
[1:50:45] those elect with him in that day will
[1:50:47] be. Someone say will be. Will be the
[1:50:50] ones who truly manifest the Lord and be
[1:50:52] his body and be his voice. Hallelujah.
[1:50:56] Come on, Hattie. Right. You got a right
[1:50:57] to speak for your children. Come on,
[1:50:59] Ruth. You got a right to speak to your
[1:51:01] husband. You got a right to the Holy
[1:51:03] Ghost. You got a right to the things of
[1:51:05] God.
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm weak. I'm a housewife. I'm
[1:51:11] this. I'm that or the other. My kids are
[1:51:12] sick. They You got a right.
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, you don't know what I've done or
[1:51:17] what I've been through. You got a right
[1:51:19] to speak.
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:51:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said, "Lu and Wesley were
[1:51:27] the voice of God in their day. I just
[1:51:30] feel his presence here this morning with
[1:51:31] us."
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; He said, "When the Methodist failed, God
[1:51:34] raised up others."
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; So, has it gone on through the years
[1:51:37] until in this last day,
[1:51:39] &gt;&gt; there is. Amen.
[1:51:42] &gt;&gt; Again,
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; Another people in the land.
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; So if a prophet identified as here, can
[1:51:51] we say it's here this morning?
[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; Who under their messenger
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; will be the final voice
[1:51:59] &gt;&gt; to the final age.
[1:52:02] Revelation 10:11, he told John, who was
[1:52:04] the type of the bride after the opening
[1:52:06] of the book, he said, "Thou must
[1:52:08] prophesy again before many peoples and
[1:52:11] nations and tongues and kings."
[1:52:13] Revelation 22:17, "The spirit and the
[1:52:15] bride say, come."
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; Let him that heareth say, "Come." Let
[1:52:22] him that is a thirst come. And whosoever
[1:52:25] will, let him take the water of life
[1:52:28] freely. Musicians come. As we close,
[1:52:30] there is a bride on the earth today.
[1:52:34] &gt;&gt; And that bride is the final voice.
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, do you believe it this morning,
[1:52:41] church?
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; Do you believe? If you can believe it,
[1:52:45] listen, brother, I'm going to tell the
[1:52:46] people if you can believe it. He said
[1:52:48] the angel told him if you can get the
[1:52:49] people to believe you,
[1:52:51] &gt;&gt; cancer won't even stand in the way.
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; If you get the people to believe you,
[1:52:55] any We've seen sickness heal. We've seen
[1:52:58] everything that every miracle possible
[1:53:00] that could happen has happened right
[1:53:02] around us.
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; We've seen these things.
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; Then if we could believe for that, can
[1:53:07] you believe this morning as the widow
[1:53:09] woman, as the woman who's come now to be
[1:53:11] married, no longer a widow, can you
[1:53:13] believe this morning that he will find
[1:53:15] faith?
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; Can you believe that if the rapture
[1:53:18] happened right now, that you'd be ready
[1:53:20] for it?
[1:53:21] &gt;&gt; Do you have the kind of faith to say, "I
[1:53:23] know I'm going to be there. My life may
[1:53:25] be troubled right now. I might have
[1:53:27] circumstances that drag me down. I might
[1:53:29] even at times have doubted. Listen, you
[1:53:31] say, "Well, I doubted one time." Listen,
[1:53:33] it was it was Abraham and Sarah sitting
[1:53:35] there. Abraham doubted so much she
[1:53:37] laughed at the promise, but she still
[1:53:39] had the son. Why? Because the Bible said
[1:53:41] a Sarah herself received faith for the
[1:53:44] promise.
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, church, it's a gift that God gives
[1:53:46] us. Aren't you glad to know there will
[1:53:48] be a bride? Will I find faith? The
[1:53:50] answer is emphatically yes. Yes, he has
[1:53:54] found faith. Yes, there is a bride. I'm
[1:53:56] not pumping you up this morning. I'm
[1:53:58] trying to get you to believe in what you
[1:53:59] are.
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; Trying to get you to believe Jesus could
[1:54:02] cast out the epilepsy devil because he
[1:54:04] believed in who he was.
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; We got to believe. That's what this
[1:54:07] opening of the word came to do to help
[1:54:09] us believe in who we are.
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; I believe I'm that woman that can ask.
[1:54:16] I'm that bride that can ask. If you need
[1:54:19] the Holy Ghost this morning, you ask
[1:54:20] him.
[1:54:21] &gt;&gt; You lay yourself down. Submit yourself
[1:54:23] to the word.
[1:54:24] &gt;&gt; Yes. Here I am at your feet, Lord.
[1:54:28] Hallelujah.
[1:54:30] You're not a You're not a widow seeking
[1:54:34] an unjust judge. There's been a marriage
[1:54:35] ceremony take place. You're a bride
[1:54:38] asking her husband
[1:54:40] and he will give good things, good gifts
[1:54:42] to his children, to his wife. Aren't you
[1:54:45] glad for that today? Let's bow our heads
[1:54:47] together.
[1:54:49] [Music]
[1:54:51] I I hope it hasn't been too hard for us
[1:54:53] to follow.
[1:54:54] Hope we can understand today.
[1:54:57] I
[1:54:59] Oh, church.
[1:55:02] If you could just believe in what you
[1:55:04] are,
[1:55:06] you think, well, I got to do this. I got
[1:55:07] to do that. I got to jump through these
[1:55:09] hoops. I've got to I've got to I got to
[1:55:11] set my life up just right. And every
[1:55:14] time you do that, everything falls
[1:55:15] apart. And you think, well, I messed up.
[1:55:17] Now I can never be right. If you can
[1:55:19] believe that you are the bride of Jesus
[1:55:21] Christ, you can have what you asked for
[1:55:24] this morning. What do you have need of
[1:55:25] today? I believe you can meet that need
[1:55:27] going into the meetings so we can be a
[1:55:29] help to somebody else. I believe we can
[1:55:31] meet our needs can be met this morning.
[1:55:33] The sick can be healed. We can have
[1:55:35] faith to believe. I'm not a loser. I'm
[1:55:37] not what the devil says I am. I'm not
[1:55:39] some kind of a a strange person or a
[1:55:42] cult. I'm I'm a member of the bride of
[1:55:44] Jesus Christ. I believe. I trust you,
[1:55:48] Lord. Oh, I pray you'd grant it today.
[1:55:51] Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, as we
[1:55:54] preach the word, Lord, I pray there'd be
[1:55:56] faith in the building, Lord, that people
[1:55:58] would know that you are God. You're the
[1:56:00] same yesterday, today, and forever. I
[1:56:02] trust you, Lord. Lord, I trust you for
[1:56:05] salvation. Lord, my own salvation,
[1:56:07] though I've been saved filled with the
[1:56:08] Holy Ghost every day, Lord. Lord, I make
[1:56:11] sure my own salvation. And I pray God, I
[1:56:13] thank you for let for something that we
[1:56:15] can trust, Lord, that we can lay down at
[1:56:18] your feet, trust you, oh God, give our
[1:56:23] all to you. I thank you for that, Lord.
[1:56:26] I pray you'd help us to do that. Or if
[1:56:28] there's one here who's not surrendered
[1:56:29] fully to you, I pray that they would do
[1:56:31] that today. If there's one here, maybe a
[1:56:33] child, maybe a young person, an old
[1:56:35] person, Lord, maybe they've lived a life
[1:56:37] of sin and and they realize they're a
[1:56:39] sinner. May they come to you this
[1:56:41] morning and recognize there is a savior.
[1:56:44] Oh God, help them to know who who they
[1:56:46] are. That they may be in the pawn shop,
[1:56:48] but you're you're there at the counter.
[1:56:50] You paid the price. Let them accept it,
[1:56:53] Lord, and be caught up by your hand.
[1:56:56] Pray you grant it, Lord Jesus. We love
[1:56:58] you and we thank you for all that you've
[1:57:00] done and what you're continuing to do. I
[1:57:02] pray for these meetings, Lord. I pray
[1:57:05] that you'd just be an outpouring of your
[1:57:07] spirit. I pray Lord for the people
[1:57:09] that'll work so hard. I pray you give
[1:57:11] them strength and Lord for the for the
[1:57:14] ministers that'll come. I pray their
[1:57:16] focus would be on the word Lord and
[1:57:17] they'd preach the word with all their
[1:57:19] heart to help the people Lord. And I
[1:57:21] pray when we're done, Lord, that we can
[1:57:23] rejoice together, Lord. We don't know,
[1:57:26] maybe before the meetings come, we'll go
[1:57:28] into rapture and that would be
[1:57:29] wonderful, Lord. If we get to Thursday
[1:57:31] night, let us rejoice in this place as
[1:57:34] if we were already there. I pray you'd
[1:57:37] grant it, Lord. Oh, we love you, Lord.
[1:57:39] We thank you for all that you've done. I
[1:57:40] pray that you'd move now in the
[1:57:42] audience. Move among these people that
[1:57:44] you speak to each one in their hearts.
[1:57:45] We pray by your word. Jesus name. Amen.
[1:57:50] Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[1:57:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:55] I'm so happy.
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, could you just sing it now? Oh, cuz
[1:58:00] I've accepted
[1:58:04] the word
[1:58:06] of the Lord. The revealed word. Oh, can
[1:58:10] we stand together and sing it? The
[1:58:12] revealed.
