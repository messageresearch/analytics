it good to be in the house of the Lord on a Sunday morning amen just appreciate the presence of the Lord that we feel here I want to read from 1 Samuel chapter 1 verse 25 I want to say happy Mother's Day to all of you mothers out there and we're so blessed to have you and none of us would be here without a mother and so we're thankful for you and uh I wanted to say that uh good to have our visitors today each one of you here some of you here for your mothers and and and most of the congregation back together this morning good to have you this morning God bless you and and uh you have all these young ones sitting on the front row my goodness what an army that's raising up I pray that they just really receive from the Lord this morning but Allen said we won't have church this afternoon I want to say happy birthday to almost my entire family this week uh Peter had a birthday on Friday I think and and then Esther will have a birthday Monday I believe and Britney have a birthday this week as well at Tuesday and uh so we do birthdays and Mother's Day and all of that the same week and it's that way every year so you pray for me so pray for my pocketbook so uh but I want to say happy birthday to my family they're such a big part of what we do here in the church and I know you as a church appreciate them and and you treat them so well and I thank you for doing that and I'd rather you I know what brother Brandon meant by that when he said I'd rather you treat my children good than treat me good and uh I appreciate that very much the way you treat my wife and my children and uh we thank you for that let's turn to 1st Samuel chapter 1 verse 25 good have brother Joel back with us today and those that have been traveling some others still traveling they slew a a bulock and brought the child to Eli and she said this is Hannah speaking Samuel's mother oh my Lord as thy soul liveth my Lord I am the woman that stood by thee here praying unto the Lord for this child I prayed and the Lord hath given me my petition which I ask of him oh it's one thing to ask it's another thing to stand there and say here he is here's the Fulfillment of the promise for this child I prayed and the Lord ha given me my petition which I ask of him therefore also I have lent him to the Lord as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the Lord and He worshiped the Lord there I pray the Lord would add his Blessing to the word you may be seated was also Allison and Stewart's birthday last week God bless you guys thank you for being such a big part of the church and doing what you do we gave the mothers uh the day off mostly a couple of them Sayang but we try to give them mothers to day off on the instruments today and thank you for doing all that you do ever since these words were written in scripture for this child I pray mothers who had trouble conceiving or carrying a child and were finally blessed with a child have repeated those words for this child I prayed today there's seems like that's not the goal of many women to have children it seems like an afterthought seems like people almost look down on it that it's just you know it's it's not as good as having a career or something else but I want to honor you today in this that that's the highest calling that a woman I think could have is to be a mother it's not an afterthought it's not an accident children are not just something that get in the way although to people today many people they do but children are are something that's essential not only to the survival of the species but also uh in the church to the survival of the church it's also essential uh in in the way that they're trained and the way that they're raised so it's not just having children but raising children but but children are a lot of work and I think you mothers could could say Amen to that this morning children are a lot of work they uh uh they require picking up after and and and looking after and chasing after and and praying for the children require a lot of work I've heard that or read that uh the average mother spends three and a half more hours a week doing housework than a woman without children I don't believe that I believe that's way more than that but that's probably three and a half hours per child too my mother had eight children so but you add that up and and it's 754 hours of work every year it means a mother with the child works on average uh works on average uh the equivalent of 3 months of 12 hour days every year with one child more than what they would without that child and and I'll say the burden of that work is mostly on the mother and and I think a man should help every way that he can I I do I believe a man should help and I'm proud of our our young men for helping their wives and not feeling that that's beneath them to do that and yet we're not The Mother We Can't be and and and if you go into motherhood expecting that a man to be able to do all the things you can do it's just not possible it just doesn't happen and uh with I was able to work and my wife was able to stay home and I know it's not always that way sometimes you struggle and both have to work but but for us she was able to stay home but I never had to wake up at night and and and take care of the baby and mama was sick if if Britney got sick she just went ahead and took care of them anyway and and I I never thought about that when I was younger now I think about that brother Mark I think my goodness you know she took care of the children through all of that she never complained about that and I was pastoring and working full-time and and doing that when we first got married when we had our first child and she was a young mother very young a teenager and and we were uh we were coming together but she had something in her it's just an instinct that's in mothers to be able to do that you were born to do that there's something in you and I think that ought to give you confidence as mothers especially if you're an expecting mother or a young mother you can do that you you were made to do that you're born to to do that and and God will help you to do that if you have a desire to be a mother especially to to care for your children God will God will grant that desire I really believe that and yet the burden again is mostly on the mother and so mothers many women today don't want to be mothers and and we find the fertility rate has declined since 1957 that at that time there were 122 births per thousand women now there's less than half of that uh as of as of 2022 was less than half the birth rate has been cut in half since that time it's interesting that that brother brandham picks that up and recognizes it during a time when when everybody wanted to be a mother and it was culturally significant brother Brandon makes a statement he says he said they want to Mother dogs and cats they don't want to be a mother to Children anymore and people at that time would have looked at that and said brother brandom you're an old crank you don't know what you're talking about people are having more babies than they ever had but he was a prophet right he's looking ahead he's looking at today he's looking at what we see today in an era when it's when it's downplayed and now they even say men can be a mother and have children just it's it's it's it's stupidity it's it's insanity and and yet and we live in that kind of an age but brother Brandon being a prophet could see what was coming but it's difficult to be a mom and you know depending on your children too right it kind of depends on how difficult it might be I heard of a mother who uh uh who had three or four little children they were a little bit unruly and they were running around getting into things breaking things and I know we don't have any children like that but but they were just doing everything they could do you know and somebody was watching them and and they said to the mother they said uh do you ever regret having children if you had to do it over again would you do it again she saidoh my yes she Saidi love children' she said I just want different children I was probably one of those children but brother brandom I know that's humorous but brother brandom types that to the church he types it to the church he talked about a woman that doesn't want to be a mother he said a true picture of the modern church today neither does the modern Church want any of these here screaming shouting tongue speaking acts 238 youngans around her so the church is saying oh we want children just not these children not these messy children not these Born Again children not these believing children we want children but not these children but I'm proud to be one of those children today I'm proud to be one of those children he was talking about he said she don't want any any of them whooping and crying and screaming amen hallelujah why such a child would immediately put her out of a denomination he said if they had one like that in one of the churches why they throw her out right quick why you letting such stuff as this go along he said so you see she's pregnant with something cuz she's bringing forth members all the time but she don't want none of them screaming hollering blabbering acts 238 miserable creatures that she thinks they are I'm so happy to be what the world calls miserable I want to be one of those children that love God with all of my heart and willing to show it willing to express it because I was born I was saved from a life of sin and I was brought to the house of God and it put joy in my heart and a smile on my face and a shouting of the king in the camp I want to be one of those children don't you hey man she thinks we're miserable but go ahead and think that because I know who my redeemer is I know he lives I know that he saved me I know he brought me out it would certainly embarrass her they would be embarrassed by these kind of children it would ruin her in her educated ethical scientific Society church that she belonged to here they would throw her out at the next Council she can't have it she don't want to be pregnant with the word because that's the only kind that the word can bring forth I'm glad the word is still bringing forth children I want to have a church where the word can still bring forth that kind of a child that can still love God with all of their heart amen so churches want members but they don't want that kind of member mothers want children but not that kind of child but to be a mother is to love unconditionally right amen churches want members but they don't want life all right they don't want life yeah and you know I was reading about chickens one time and you know they've actually bred the mothering ability out of chickens it's called Broody when a CH when a chicken is Broody it means that she will she will quit laying eggs and and just care for those eggs she's already laid but they don't want that they want production they don't want life because they're going to take the eggs and sell them at the supermarket they want production so they actually find the worst Mama chicken they can find it's counterintuitive but they want bad chickens they want chickens that don't want to raise their their their own children and the church today is the same way the ability to be a mother has been bred out of the modern chicken farms right but I believe there's a place I believe not just this place but wherever the word of God is preached today I believe it's a place where people can be born again where the Holy Spirit still Broods over the church it's not been denominated out of the church I want to say this morning thank God for Godly mothers who choose to raise their children and care for their children you know the Bible tells us that God I want us to think deeply about this this morning I appreciate the atmosphere this morning I feel free to preach I you know brother Joel went into Oklahoma and preached for an hour and a half on a Sunday night so I just feel freedom today to preach as long as I want to we won't do that I know you got plans today but the Bible tells us that God prevented Hannah from having children and she was a real godly woman she wanted to be a mother and God prevented it now that it seems strange to us but there was a purpose let's look at the story of Hannah 1st Samuel 1:1 was a certain man of rth named Zim of Mount Ephraim his name was Elena the son of jeroham the son of elu the son of toou the son of ZF and ephrathite he had two wives the name of the one was Hannah the name of the other was panina panina had children but Hannah had no children polygamy was legal in those days but it never worked every time you have polygamy in the Bible you see jealousy in the home every time verse three and this man went up out of his City yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the Lord of hosts in Shiloh and the two sons of Eli Hof and Finos the priests of the Lord were there can we stop and say something about this man for a minute he knew everybody knew that Hof and Fin were backslid everybody knew that they were they were doing things they shouldn't have been doing at the temple and everybody knew that Eli didn't do nothing about it when he should have but it didn't stop him from going to church he still went even though the ministry and I trust that we've got better Ministry than that I I I hope that you see your ministry is better than that it's not a bunch of backs sitting preachers but if it was I wonder if we'd have the the courage that he did he wasn't going there to worship the preacher he was going there to worship God and he was taking his family to worship God so he went he went up to the house of the Lord and when the time was that Elena offered he gave to panina his wife and all her sons and her daughters portions but unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion for he loved Hannah but the Lord had shut up her womb the Lord shut her womb the Lord did it and no doctor could fix that no home remedy and I believe that you should do all that you can do to whatever medical problem that you might have but sometimes God allows something in your life and if he does there will be nothing that can fix that but maybe he just waiting until you get to a place where only he can fix it so he can do a miracle in your life now we know that every child comes from God um am I be hard for my mother to believe but every child comes from God it's these other children not me all of them even the youngest sister Tabitha every child comes from God we know that because when Eve had came she said I have gotten a man from the Lord right God allowed that child to be born brother Brandon said you could take the honorious woman in town and the worst man if they had a baby it would have to come from the Lord because God has laws set together so in other words God to God belongs the issues of life and death he has he is the one if there's life there he allowed it and it came from him right right so every child comes from God the ugliest child the the the honorous child the worst child all come even the middle child they come from God right because God has laws set together when it happens God allows it when it doesn't happen God prevents it because he controls life now I want us to think when we're thinking about this about more than having children because some of us are past that stage thank the Lord but I I want us to think of it as a promise that you're holding on to right there's something that you need in your life something you want in your life something that has been delayed right and so it may be your healing it might be a job it might be your ministry it might be something else and so many people try to rush and and get impatient in those things but we realize that he holds those things in his hands and he knows the time and what we have to do is just believe and and move forward because he holds those things in his hands he knows knows why he doesn't do it he doesn't always tell us why but he knows why and to him are the issues of Life listen how David puts it he said you have possessed my reign and I use this scripture a lot but it really it really strikes me because that range that's your DNA that's what you're made out of he actually possesses that he actually made you the way you are you have possessed my rign you have covered me in my mother's womb the reason I'm here come on is because God allow me to be here the reason you're here is because God there are no accidents with God that's why we don't believe in abortion we don't believe in killing babies because every life comes from God sir there's zero accidents right God allows the the baby to be born right and I'm so glad for that brother brand in one place he says that every child is born he said it's like Hannah's child I'm paraphrasing but every child is like Hannah's child he said if it's here you prayed for it and God allowed for it to be here so it's a miracle even child birth is a miracle brother B said more miraculous than than the than the second birth than the supernatural birth is the natural birth because of all that has to happen for that to take place in Psalms 31:15 David said my times are in thy hand my times you could drive out of here and have an accident today God forbid and that would be the end of your time but only God knows that you could get a disease you could you could live to be 150 and and you be you say well no one else has ever done it only God knows right when your time is so it doesn't do us a whole lot of good to sit there thinking about it right and dwelling on it because my times are in thy hand the B said my time belongs to him I'm his I'm in his hand because he holds the time I don't know what the future holds but I know he holds the future so he who holds the future holds me oh if we could just remember that today we'd worry a lot less if we'd remember he who holds the future holds me he said patience patience some of us gets so some of us gets in such a hurry he said I think a many a good man has done that you get in too much of a hurry you want to see you want to do it yourself he said Minister Brethren you know from when I'm talking you just listening to this tape he said I'm talking to you not only to the little congregation here but men around the world many men go out impatient but believing that the time is near you try to do something within yourself wait upon the Lord patience is virtue if you can have patience it's virtue they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength not they that try to get ahead of the Lord they that try to tell the Lord Lord I know you want me to do this and glory to God he said don't do that wait upon the Lord the Bible said they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength aren't you glad for that today Abraham and Sarah waited 25 years yes After the Promise was given and she was already too old to have a child right when the promise was given so they really waited many many decades for their baby during that 25 years ishmail was born ishmail is brother bam calls him the seed of a slightly doubted promise the seed I love that the seed of a slightly doubted promise I love it because so descriptive of an ishmail uh every time we doubt the promise of God it produces something in our life it produces an ishmail listen it doesn't matter what word it is the word of God is true 100% of it's true that's why I I can't take any man's word over the scripture I can't take any man's word over the message of the hour why because if it's true it's God's word and if it's God's word it's always going to be true and if I even slightly doubt it it'll produce something I don't want in my life come on right so let me just believe it how many can say Amen to that today let me just believe the message of the hour let me just believe what the Bible says so and you find that during that time that ishmail was born during that 25 years that then the birth of Ishmael made Sarah and Hagar adversaries right and Hannah had an adversary the Bible says in 1st Samuel 1:6 her adversary also provoked her sore to make her fret because the Lord had shut up her womb that word fret is to Tumble to be violently agitated to to crash of Thunder to irritate with anger to make to fret Roar Thunder trouble every time she was feeling good the skies were clear and she might be thinking well today is the day my promise is going to be fulfilled here come the adversary walking by with all of her children right right getting kind of old Hannah looks like looks like it's just not going to happen for you yeah she got older she got weaker she she got she got she tried harder but nothing seemed to work and and here here her adversary come by yes and and it it just like a a a beautiful day and here she just walking along in the adversary a clap of Thunder comes by and trouble come by yeah and it made her dark it made her fret made her her attitude different and it made her worry that's the purpose of the adversary and I want to say this today there's always been an adversary between you and the promise and there always will be as long as we're here on the earth the devil is your adversary the Bible says be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour see he's an adversary I heard about a sister who would who wouldn't speak evil of anyone she was just so so kind and and finally they said well what about the devil and she said well he's a good adversary and he is that's his job the adversary he is our adver we always have one as long as we're here but I'm thankful it won't be forever because we won't be here forever but the adversary will be cast down in Revelation 12:10 I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now has come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ for the accuser of our Brethren is cast down which accused him before our God day and night oh he there's coming a day when he won't darken the skies anymore there's coming a day won't make a spread anymore he won't make us worry anymore he won't be there to make us worry that's good won't be there to accuse us we'll be delivered and and but even here the Bible says that he'll be an adversary to our adversaries oh I just love the promise of God today said but if thou sh indeed obey his voice and do all that I speak then will I be an enemy unto your enemies and an adversary to your adversaries you realize you not only you have an adversary but your adversary has an adversary oh you might be struggling with cancer but your cancer has an adversary you might be struggling with depression but that depression has an adversary you might be struggling with with with the life just in general but your ad adversary has an adversary and the truth is greater is he that is in you than he that's in the world your adversary will overcome that adversary when you have an adversary in front of you he said I'll be an adversary to your adversary I'll fight for you oh what a promise today when we're too weak in our own when we're too troubled on our own our adversary fights against that adversary that comes against us that's Hallelujah and we know sometimes the Lord actually stir up our adversaries do you know that I've preached this before but it just fit here you think of Solomon when Solomon come on the throne he said now there's peace on every side David had fought all of his life and and it was a a period of peace that was necessary for building the Temple so God allowed there to be peace when Solomon took the throne he settled all the questions and it was peace he said now the Lord my God has given me rest on every side there is neither adversary nor evil occurrent and it was necessary but without an adversary people become complacent it's just the nature of man you might say Lord why do I have to deal with this why do I have to deal with him why do I have to deal with her without an adversary people become complacent right and Solomon the great King Solomon became complacent without an adversary the Bible says the Lord was angry with Solomon because his heart was turned from the Lord God of Israel which had appeared to him twice and commanded him concerning this thing he should not go after other gods but he kept not that which the Lord commanded and the Lord stirred up an adversary unto Solomon hey Dad the Edomite he was of the king seed in Edom and God stirred him up again in verse 23 he he he defeated that adversary here comes another one God stir him up another adversary Reon the son of Eli which fled from his Lord haded deser king of zoba and he gathered men unto him and become a Captain over a band when David slew them of zoba and they went to Damascus and dwelt therein reigned in Damascus and he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon why God stirred him up right so there's this guy right he just sitting there minding his own business and and God is upset with Solomon and so he goes down begins to allows the devil to start whispering this guy's ear see God allows it right that's why the the the lying Spirit had to come the Lord said who who will go make these prophets lie and a lying Spirit come up right and and so they have to come their creature of permission but you think that guy sitting there by himself just minding his own business and he's sitting there all a sudden he starts thinking boy I hate that Solomon that's that's man he just get under my skin starts thinking like you know when you get thinking like that's the devil but the Lord allowed it for Solomon's good yeah right man that that's Solomon man tell you what the Lord stirred him up that's right and maybe even give him a reason let Solomon allow Solomon to do something make a mistake that would cause him to have an adversary right maybe and and we find David had a re of that because when he left and doe the Edomite come out there you remember started cursing him throwing rocks at him we preached on it recently he said maybe the Lord told him to do that maybe the Lord you know and even in the scripture and I know this is hard to to listen to but sometimes God himself becomes our adversary did you know that job chap 31:35 job's crying out he said all that one would hear me you ever felt like that yeah behold my desire is that the alight Mighty would answer me that my adversary had written a book remember this is before the Bible was written aren't you glad a book's been written all he had was the Stars remember that's all he had to go by just the stars and so that was the first Bible that God wrote but he said all that he had written a book surely I would take it upon my shoulder bind it as a crown to me I would declare unto him the number of my steps as a prince would I go near unto him and Jehovah would not given him give him an answer notice what he calls him back in verse that my adversary had written a book he's talking about God yeah but Jehovah never did give him an answer he just said I'm G to show you your Redeemer that's enough church I think of the SAR phenician woman you think about her the only you know she had a hard time getting to Jesus anyway right all the difficulties that she had to get into Jesus must have been difficult for her to come when she came she finally got to the feet of Jesus the Lord become her adversary right and she said Lord I my daughter needs healing and he said it's not meat for me to take the children's bread and give it to dogs but she didn't let the Lord stop her right come on right he become an adversary to test her faith but she was had that Faith was so great within her that she persevered even though the Lord said no yeah she still persevered yeah and and and what do we do when we have an adversary what did Hannah have to do we've got to persevere right we've got to just keep stepping forward keep walking forward he said but that adversary is against me but he said I'll be an adversary to your adversaries walk forward keep pressing on keep pressing forward keep pressing the battle now's not the time to quit now's not the time to lay down now's not the time to get dead and cold and formal Now's the Time to press forward if there ever was a time you say well there's Darkness on the earth there's political confusion all these things press forward now's not the time for the church to quit having Services press forward now's not the time to quit having meetings press forward let our let him do the work he promised to do he said but God himself it doesn't bless me like he used to press forward maybe he's testing you that's good Hallelujah she oh my said if the Holy Spirit of Jesus Christ proves that he's here Among Us he said then press till you get to him how many can do that this morning press till you get to him like the little woman with the bloody shoe all the different things that taking place all the adversaries in her way she just pressed right on through she'll till she touched him he said if this church tonight would do the same thing would press through every scale of unbelief would lock swords with the devil in his unbelief and press through to know that you're a child of God and an air to these things and Jesus Christ standing present to show you he's with you to keep his word be persevering don't you let nothing stand in your way oh I take that as a challenge today don't little church don't take nothing don't let nothing stand in your way don't accept anything but the word of God press forward oh that's good I wish I had more voice and more strength to preach it press forward don't let nothing stand in your way verse seven first Samuel chapter 1 as he did so and I speaking of Elena taking her to the house of God year by year when she went up to the house of the Lord so she provoked her therefore she wept did not eat year by year brother brandham said she may have been 60 to 70 years old Jewish tradition says she waited 19 years 19 years for a baby that's not uncommon in the scripture ra Rachel waited 20 years Sarah waited 25 after she received the promise but see the Bible tells us and actually the rabbis take this in the Jewish thought they look at Hannah and they say that she was tested for 19 years because she was made of the type of material that wouldn't give up because material the time time that a material is tested depends on what it is this ought to encourage somebody the time the length of time the material is tested depends on what that material is so if it's silver if it's gold Proverbs 27:21 tells us as the fining pot for silver and the furnace for gold so is a man to his praise so in English Standard Version it reads like this The Crucible is for silver and the furnace is for gold and a man is tested by his praise in other words what he is is tested by the praise that he does or she does right by the praise that they do oh my by the worship that they have while they're being tested Hallelujah proves what material they are you said but brother man I don't understand why did I have to wait longer than other women to be a mother maybe he was proving what you were yeah why did I have to wait longer than others for my healing maybe he was proving what you were maybe he was bringing out of you the kind of Praise that he wanted to see maybe he was doing something in your life he was testing you for 19 years for 20 years for 50 years he was testing you to bring something out of your life come on you say well I wanted to be healed I wanted a miracle right away sometimes he does that many times he does that but sometimes he makes us wait right right to test what kind of material hallelujah oh I want to be found to be pure gold don't you amen amen know her husband tried to help but it wasn't very helpful you know how we do Ela and her husband said to her Hannah why weep a am I why is that heart grieved am I am not I better to thee than 10 Sons it did not help I already gave you your Mother's Day gift what else do you want you know gave you double what I gave the other woman you know bamy was tough man anybody want to go back to that's nuts look not very helpful but why did she keep going she kept going in spite of all of these things she kept going to the temple every year every year she went with her husband brother Brandon said it was because faith comes by hearing right he said she went up there because Faith cometh by hearing Hallelujah and she was Barren and had no children she seen the word of God where Sarah received a baby after she was pasted bearing so Sarah received it so could Hannah hallelujah oh she went year after year after year she never gave up because she had an example of somebody who waited 25 years and was too old she said I've waited 19 years and I'm too old but I still believe that God's promise is true yes amen look so she went in the 19th year or whatever that it was she she walks into the temple year by year it got worse the adversary got harder had more material to work with but Hannah rose up after they had eaten in shallow and after they had drunk Eli the priest set upon a seat by a post to the Temple of the Lord and she was in bitterness of soul and prayed unto the Lord and wept sore she vowed a vow said oh lord of host if thou Wilt indeed look on the Affliction of thine handmade and remember me and not forget thine handmade she's praying this after 19 years she hasn't given up she hasn't accepted the status quo she she just believes year by year the Bible say they went up but this year she's still praying but she got so desperate she said if you'll remember me well give unto thine handmade a Manchild then I will give him unto the Lord all the days of his life there shall no razor come upon his head she got so desperate she promised the Lord she said if you give me a child I'll give the child back to you and he'll be a Nazarite for the Lord oh I wonder if there's any mothers that get that desperate in their prayer today they say Lord you've given me children or are you I want children or you've given me children Lord I believe these children I want to give them back to you I believe you gave me these children I want to give them back to you they're going to be they're going to be dedicated to the service of the Lord listen she may not have prayed that prayer the first year right now think about there's a reason why he makes us wait yeah she may not have prayed that prayer the first year or the second year or the 10th year right yeah but by the time oh my by the time the time was right she was desperate enough to meet the challenge of the hour because there wasn't just going to be any baby born to Hannah but a major prophet had to come on the scene sometimes the reason why God doesn't answer your prayer immediately is he's about to do something great in your life some sometimes oh church sometimes if if You' begin to expect that way Lord I know I've not gotten what I need right away but I know there must be something good at the end of this long wait at the end of this long struggle at the end of this long trial there must be something good Hallelujah she was so desperate in 1st Samuel 1:12 it says it came to pass she continued praying before the Lord Eli marked her mouth Hannah she spake in her heart only her lips moved but her voice was not heard so she she's so overcome in prayer she can't even speak anymore and she's just mouthing words and Eli thought she was drunk Eli said unto her how long will thou be drunk and put away thy wine from thee imagine the Deacon coming up to you because you've been at the altar so long they thought you were drunk or the pastor coming to you hey time to get up what you have to drink where you come to church and answered no my Lord I am a woman of a sorrowful Spirit I've drunk neither wine nor strong drink but have poured out my soul before the Lord amen count not thine handmade for a daughter of bile for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto and Eli answered and saying go in peace and the god of Israel Grant thee thy petition that thou has ask of him and she said let thine handmade find Grace in thy sight now look all he all it was was a pastor say or a priest trying to be comforting right but she accepted it as the word of the Lord Eli wasn't a prophet he wasn't even a a very good pastor or priest he was just a man but he had the position of priest and she believed amen that if a man of God told her something she could go and hang her hat on it it she could go believe it oh if we could have that kind of faith today right she believed that if a man of God told her that that she could go away and she so the woman went her away and did eat and her countenance was no more sad now what she did is she took the adopted baby route now brother Harvey was talking about that back there I had this in my notes but we won't get into the quotes but brother Bram talks about the adopted baby he said what happens is he said if a woman can't have a baby that she'll actually be so FL Ed and upset he said but you let that woman adopt a baby and he said she'll actually end up having a baby and some of y'all know that to be true I have know stories that that are that that actually happened because the woman will quit fretting she'll begin to care for that baby and then her body will react to that she'll become a mother so they actually that that works even physically and mentally but brother B said that works in faith so when you get a promise of God you get you when someone you come up to be prayed for and I lay hands on you and I say go and go and be well or go and be healed I'm just saying that by faith I I don't have any Vision or anything to tell you that but if you can it's how you take it yeah right it's not what I say it's how you take it it's not what I even say across the pulpit it's how you take it you can be healed by the word of the Lord as long as it's the word but it's not so much the eloquence of it but it's how you take it Lord that's for me and Hannah said that service was just for me I believe Eli was preaching just for me I believe that Sunday was just for me and when she did she went away and acted like she was already healed like she already had a baby glory to God and when she acted that way brother said if you'll act like you've already got it you'll go away healed sir that's good oh my that's why brother brand would always tell people go be happy can I have a few more minutes now look I haven't preached nearly as long as brother Joel yet so I haven't even out preached Stuart yet so I am aware of my time I'm a very time aware person so if I preach long I know you don't have to tell me she listen she she took that route brother brand would tell people he said go be happy and so brother Brandon one time was Discerning a man with nervousness heart trouble and a rupture what he said was wrong nervousness heart trouble and a rupture and he told him it's it's amazing the detail that was in told him he said it happened when the weather was hot and he begins to count months back to when the weather was hot said it was 6 7 8 nine months ago in August that's a prophet why he's seeing it right he's not just saying something because he's inspired or or just feels to say it he sees it he's seeing it and he said you had a heart attack about nine months ago something like that and you're scared to death now that it's going to come back again he said cuz you got a nervous heart brother he he said don't you believe that that'll bring it on you refuse to believe that lie of the devil he said when a man has a heart attack now you take this brother Brandon said it he said he's stronger than he was at the first place as you say that don't make any sense but if you believe it I wonder how your life would change come on when a man has a heart attack he's stronger than he was at the first place he said you believe with all your heart then go rejoicing praising God be over your trouble amen go and be happy and rejoice in other words he's saying it's not your heart that's your problem it's you what you think about your heart that's the problem that's good that's good you see and our motives have to be right you know even for healing or whatever our motives need to be right now brother Brandon talks about Mo the motive of having a baby I want to dwell on that for a moment but you can apply it to other areas of your life the motive has to be right a mother a woman wanted to have a baby that's a right motive right we don't see that today that's a right motive brother brandom says this he said you've come for a very good reason he Saidi respect and honor you he's talking to a woman in a pray line cuz you're Barren you want children isn't that right you've heard somebody told you about what happened and so forth he said I've never asked that in my life but what God granted it now that's a right motive he said I never asked it in my life but what God granted it wow he said I see you kneeling praying he said it's it's in a room there's another woman he said I hear you you what you're saying you're asking a worthy thing you're asking God to give you a child a baby you're baren and asking God to give you a baby he said that's right God bless you I've never seen him fail on one yet all right Hallelujah a woman in Chicago 50 something years old come and ask for a baby she got a fine boy he said may God grant it to you he was praying for another woman wanting a child he said heavenly father in the day that's so evil now and here's a woman wanting a little one God bless her as you have the many hundreds across the country he said and make her well of this may she embrace the loved one that she wishes in Jesus Christ's name amen said God bless you Sister go receive in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ now watch I want you to understand brother Brandon prayed for a woman to have a baby it didn't always happen in nine months true in fact most of the time I'd say probably it didn't but sometimes it did but sometimes the wait is much longer than 9 months brother tells a story about Richard Reid who was the pastor the Bible Hour Tabernacle in Jonesboro Arkansas about an hour and a half from here where some of y'all live the church was right downtown in Jonesboro a little old uh uh United Pentecost or Wess church and that's where brother brandom kind of began his ministry at that point in that great Jonesboro Revival and it was Richard Reed's wife and brother BR said one morning I walked out of the room brother Brandon was staying with them and he said she was taking doctors or shots from from the doctrine everything almost caused her to lose her mind didn't do any good I'm glad for modern medicine it they call it practicing medicine for a reason because back in the day there was a lot that went wrong and they they've come a long ways but you still trust God more than you trust the doctor right because the doctor could be wrong but God's never wrong and and one morning I walking out of the room I said sister Reed I see you holding a little boy baby in your arms you shall have it God has rewarded you now it's interesting what she was rewarded for brother Brandon Walks out she's playing the piano and she was playing an old favorite song of mine all you legalists going to have to close your ears because it wasn't a christian song He said a whole favorite song of mine it's not a Christian song it's Home on the Range he said I think it sounds so peaceful and I said God is going to bring peace to your family right and he's going to bring the little boy baby and 5 Years From that year she embraced a little boy baby I was holding him two or three weeks ago in my hands trotting him up and down the aisles of the place right where it was said the Lord granted he said that's one of hundreds five years this was special to my heart because brother brandom was talking about a lady who was complimenting brother brandom on his sermon and no matter what preachers tell you they all like it they may not need it but they all like it right so she was compliment brother Bram on the sermon brother BR remarked how nice she was and while she was standing there I saw a vision said now she was way in her middle age he said this has been eight years ago I said sister thus sayith the Lord I see you standing holding a baby in your arms in a little blanket she said me I said Yes Man you it's thus sayith the Lord she said I hope you're right I said it isn't me speaking it's thus sayith the lord well two or three four years passed and she began to doubt it her husband's name was Mr doble she was Mrs doble a very generous man brother man talked about how he wanted to give brother Rand his coat and some guy had come by some so-called Prophet we still have so-called prophets today but they aren't that Prophet right there was a prophet to the age right and some Prophet come by and told him to quit his job because the Russians were going to invade Canada and so they were going to overtake the place where he lived and said quit your job so prophecies like that have real world implications right the man quit his job and brother brand said he used to send Christmas gifts and everything to the family and he couldn't do it no more because he quit his job and and now so brother brandom talked to him he said he didn't want to say nothing about the brother that said that he said I slipped off went out knelt down started praying when I did the angel of the Lord came now remember this is the the woman's husband a woman that had waited three or four years she began to doubt said when I did the angel of the Lord come said go tell him thus sayth the Lord go on up there because the man's wrong other words go take your job back the man's wrong and said also speak to him to tell his wife to watch that doubting she's doing about that baby amen three or four years he said so I went back I said brother doble not to discredit your brother your friend whoever it is the man might have been impressed to say that I don't want to have anything light of that brother no sir see Impressions aren't thus sayith the Lord right but I said I have as a servant of the Lord thus sayth the lord well I'm glad there was one in our age I'm glad there was one in our age I have thus sayi the Lord you'll be safe and be blessed go do the work he said if you say that brother brandom I believe it I said tell your wife to quit doubting about that baby he said that's been about three years ago four years three years brother BR said total of about eight years he said last week the baby was born after eight years and something God's word is eternally true and the same God that lives the same God that lived in the Old Testament is the same God that lived today how many believe that lives today hundreds of those cases he said now again I want you to apply this to anything you need in your life anything you've been waiting on now look this woman there's more to this story she actually got TB during that 8year period and she come to brother brand be prayed for over that and right before she and and she ends up coming and to brother brandom he said I said why did she doubt it he said well brother BR it lingered so long she be to doubt and this is when he's talking to her husband I said I don't care how much she doubts I saw that Vision I love this she was holding a great big flumpy baby boy and it shall come to pass regardless of what she says or what she thinks sir are you talk about the grace of God because God already said so a vision cannot be hindered oh church he said it'll come to pass regardless what she says or what she thinks that he he was caught up beyond the curtain of time and he said he said I saw you there and I put my name there I believe my face is one that he saw there he saw the vision the vision cannot be hindered I'm going to be there oh you ought to take that stti that claim yourself I'm going to be there why because thus sayith the Lord come in our hour I'm going to be one of those millions that said we're resting on that I don't care who says anything else I don't care who doubts let the internet say what it wants to let the world say what they want to let people say what they want to and say well you're doing it wrong you're doing this wrong let me stay with the word of the Prophet because he already told us I don't care how much you doubts it's going to be there you say the bride's going downhill nothing's going right we're just going to get in by the skin of our teeth I refuse to believe it on why because the vision said there'll be a bride without spot or wrinkle washing the blood of the Lamb let me be somebody who holds on like Hanah it says I believe I believe help thou my unbelief Hallelujah three days before she was due the same woman visited brother brandom she said one thing brother brandom I confess my sin of UN believe now she's having a baby said but one thing I want to ask you for a confirmation you said it would be a boy I said it will be a boy just as soon as they could return her home she had A8 pound baby boy that's running around in Canada tonight of a mother over 50 years old because God keeps his word he never fails see God was doing something bigger than Hannah realized brother Brandon said she got on her knees she never noticed the Dignity of the temple she never notice a dignified priest as he walked out she was in such distress till her tears were rolling down her cheeks she was crying in desperation oh Lord God give me a son give me a son and notice he said she wasn't selfish when God heard her and answered to prayer and gave her a son she gave him back to God and because she was willing not to be selfish after God answered her prayer he gave her a prophet and she prayed with desperation she must have this child what was it he said God had spoke to her no doubt remember Faith come by hearing how did God speak to her through Eli Hallelujah you can't be desperate till God speaks to you oh Church Rise Up and Shake Yourself pinch your conscience wake yourself up in this hour he said we must be desperate or perish there's coming for something from the Lord I know it is thus sayith the Lord he said there's coming forth something we better get desperate it's between life and death it'll pass through us and we won't see it right oh my oh I believe he's doing it in our hour God shut up her womb to make her desperate because she was so desperate all the selfishness went away the child that she had was a prophet not just any child but a prophet I want to talk to you mothers now for just a moment who have children that are born but maybe they're not Believers maybe they tell you that not a Believer we have a promise right we have a promise no matter how much they say they don't believe we have a promise right he said believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved and thy house brother Brandon said thy and thy house now look if you have faith enough for salvation for yourself can't you also have faith enough for your house God in some way will do it Hallelujah sir sister Curtis I thought of you and brother Curtis today or the other day when I was reading this because this was a brother and sister Spencer and at the time brother BR says this sister Spencer is 82 years old 82 years old when when he says this when he prays this for them he said ' Lord I pray for sister Spencer and brother Spencer tonight that every child them and their children will all be in that glorious Happy Land there where there'll be no sickness or no old age no sorrow or disappointments and all this little life here will fade into a nightmare that's passed by listen this life can be good it can have its moments it can have it it can have its moments of pleasure moments of happiness but remember when it when it's compared to that life it's like a nightmare just a nightmare to compare to what's coming over there all the glory the the the good feeling that you have today if you're a mother and and you just love your children and and your children to are good to you on Mother's Day that's wonderful but remember it don't even hold a candle it's like a nightmare compared to that that's true Hallelujah she said may they receive this and may all her children and her husband all her loved ones all all that love her and all that she loves may they be there with her in Jesus name amen I know some of you some of you Elders some of you mothers you didn't have children maybe of your own and you adopted other children took other children in let me say this he said not only her children but all that loves her and all that she loves claim your children you say well it's not my my natural child claim that child the natural birth don't have nothing to do with it it's because you're a seed of God right and that's not a natural seed it's a spiritual Seed of Abraham right yes Hallelujah never too late to start believing true sister frit you know that's true never too late to start believing there'll be bad days but there'll be good days too it's never too late to start believing for your children never too late to start believing for your grandchildren never too late to start believing for those that you love and I know there are those that you love Hannah left church that day with an assurance Samuel was already hers the Bible says they rose up in the morning early and worshiped before the Lord and returned and came to their house to Rama elen and knew Hannah his wife and the Lord remembered her wherefore it came to pass when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived that she bear a son and called his name Samuel saying because I have asked him of the Lord Hannah kept her word she brought him to Eli when he was wean and and she presented him to him and she said for this child oh what a moment that must have been for her all the years of praying all the hours at the altar all the time that she spent asking and she said for this child yeah here he is here's the promise fulfilled yeah oh Church we're living in in the time of the Fulfillment of promises and Hannah cried out to God Hannah prayed said my heart rejoices in the Lord my horn is exalted in the Lord my mouth is enlarged over my enemies because I rejoice in thy salvation there is none Hool is the Lord there is none beside thee neither is there any Rock like our god oh do you believe that today Church there is no Rock like my God there's no Revelation like this Revelation verse eight he raiseth up the poor Out of the Dust lifteth up the beggar from the dung Hill to set them among princes where did this song come from it come out of the waiting it come out of the delay it come out of the hardship it come out of the years right Hallelujah to make them inherit the Throne of Glory for the pillars of the earth of the Lord he has set the world upon him he will keep the feet of his Saints the wicked shall be silent in darkness for by strength shall no man Prevail the adversaries of the Lord shall be broken to Pieces Out of Heaven shall he Thunder upon them the Lord shall judge the ends of the Earth and he shall give strength unto his King and exalt the Horn of his anointed It's A Prophecy of the Messiah that a woman God needed that to be written in the scripture so he made her wait oh God one day she could say
