[42:05] door opens in their life oh god and they
[42:08] begin to see a manifestation of the will
[42:10] of god in their life and healing
[42:13] salvation of the children and things i
[42:15] pray you'd grant it lord we thank you
[42:17] for all that you've done and we put this
[42:19] service in your hands tonight we ask it
[42:22] in jesus name
[42:23] amen
[42:25] amen
[42:27] hallelujah
[42:29] it's so good to hear you sing tonight i
[42:31] know you're excited to be here and so we
[42:33] want to go right into the word i don't
[42:35] have a
[42:36] lot of notes tonight and things in fact
[42:39] what i'm going to say comes from a
[42:40] sermon of brother branham's
[42:42] and i'm just going to preach it to you
[42:43] tonight i i don't have the quotes on the
[42:46] board but i'll have this some scriptures
[42:48] but you just bear with me tonight i felt
[42:50] this on my heart
[42:52] second kings chapter three and verse 16.
[42:56] second kings chapter 3 and verse 16
[43:01] and he said
[43:03] thus saith the lord aren't you glad you
[43:06] can hear thus sayeth the lord
[43:08] thus saith the lord
[43:10] make this valley full
[43:13] of ditches
[43:15] what what an odd prophecy
[43:18] make this valley full
[43:21] of ditches i pray that the lord would
[43:23] add his blessing to the word you may be
[43:25] seated
[43:31] in a few weeks now we're going to have
[43:33] our meetings
[43:35] here at the church
[43:37] so begin to think about that
[43:39] and we're going overseas
[43:41] in the meantime in between now and then
[43:43] and
[43:44] we've got a lot on our plate
[43:47] oh how i would like to see an outpouring
[43:49] of the holy ghost
[43:51] yes sir
[43:52] we need it we we need the holy spirit
[43:55] some people think that we don't
[43:57] we need a move of the holy spirit in our
[43:59] lives and our homes and our worlds
[44:02] we live in we need him we we can't go
[44:05] off without him we need him
[44:07] we need him if we're going to go and be
[44:09] of any use in in egypt if we're going to
[44:12] be in use here
[44:13] if the word of the lord is ever going to
[44:15] become present we need an outpouring of
[44:16] the holy spirit and i'm not just talking
[44:19] about an emotional revival but a a
[44:21] movement of the spirit of god that could
[44:24] bring souls to a place where they ought
[44:26] to be that that could make us want to do
[44:28] the word of god that that gives us that
[44:31] action and that inspiration to begin to
[44:33] work and and to begin to do and and like
[44:36] i said you begin to want to be in church
[44:38] you begin to want to serve god with all
[44:41] of your heart and that's what's lacking
[44:42] so many times that even among christians
[44:45] it seems like that that fervent desire
[44:47] that burning of the spirit of god to to
[44:50] become more like christ to become more
[44:53] what he wants us to be it seems like it
[44:55] it's lacking and the devil does
[44:57] everything that he can to try to throw a
[44:59] wet blanket on us and try to make it
[45:01] where we can't hardly seem to worship
[45:03] and and it's a chore to raise our hands
[45:06] it's a chore to worship it it's a chore
[45:08] to sing but i tell you i want to be in a
[45:10] in a service where the freedom of god is
[45:13] there where the preacher can preach and
[45:15] and deliver his heart and we're the
[45:17] where the spirit of god can move and the
[45:19] people can raise their hands and
[45:21] and and worship and receive the word and
[45:24] where sinners would be convicted and and
[45:27] if there's something that's not right
[45:28] even in a church member that they'd make
[45:31] it right and and those are the kind of
[45:33] services that we need we don't need
[45:35] dried theology we don't just need that
[45:38] we need the spirit of god to move in our
[45:40] midst you believe you can do that
[45:42] tonight
[45:43] hey man i know it's a little bit
[45:45] different maybe for me to preach in in
[45:47] this way but it just was stirring my
[45:49] heart as i began to listen to a sermon
[45:51] that brother branham preached called
[45:52] make this valley
[45:54] full
[45:54] of ditches
[45:56] ditches now in second kings chapter 3
[45:59] and verse 1
[46:01] jehoram the son of ahab began to reign
[46:03] over israel and samaria in the 18th year
[46:06] of jehoshaphat king of judah and he
[46:08] reigned 12 years
[46:10] and he wrought evil in the sight of the
[46:11] lord
[46:12] but not like his father not to the
[46:14] degree that his father did and like his
[46:16] mother for he put away the image of baal
[46:18] that his father had made
[46:20] nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of
[46:22] jeroboam the son of nebat which made
[46:25] israel to sin
[46:26] he departed not
[46:28] there from
[46:30] but the brown said he took the place of
[46:31] his father and he was a very wicked man
[46:34] he was still worshiping the idols of his
[46:36] mother
[46:37] jezebel and the first thing that brother
[46:38] branham brings to our attention if we go
[46:41] and if you go and listen to that sermon
[46:42] just a simple sermon brother branham
[46:45] talks about how that it was marrying out
[46:47] of their ranks is what caused that and
[46:49] you think about that as not being that
[46:51] big of a deal but it does matter
[46:53] it does matter and he tells us that he
[46:55] said it'll do it in our homes too he
[46:58] said if you marry among unbelievers you
[46:59] see what takes place he said you lose
[47:02] your victory when you marry among
[47:03] unbelievers and i think we could even
[47:05] take that a step farther and say when we
[47:07] when we wed ourselves to ideas when we
[47:10] marry or
[47:12] or give ideas that we give credibility
[47:15] to ideas that are not the word we we're
[47:17] supposed to be married to the word and
[47:20] when we marry outside of our of the word
[47:22] of god what happens is we're marrying
[47:24] out of our ranks we're yoking ourselves
[47:27] up with unbelief and we lose our victory
[47:29] when we do that
[47:31] and that's what king jehoram had done in
[47:33] verse six it says king jehoram went out
[47:36] of samaria at the same time and
[47:38] numbered all of israel and he went out
[47:40] and said to jehoshaphat the king of
[47:42] judah saying the king of moab hath
[47:44] rebelled against me wilt thou go with me
[47:46] against moab to battle and he said i
[47:49] will go up i must now are my people as
[47:52] thy people my horses says not horses and
[47:54] he said which way shall we go up and he
[47:56] answered the way through the wilderness
[47:58] of edom so the king of israel went the
[48:00] king of judah and the king of edom and
[48:02] they fetched the compass of seven days
[48:04] journey there was no water for the host
[48:07] and for the cattle that followed them
[48:09] you see they got all tied up in business
[48:13] i'm just gonna preach to you for a
[48:15] little while it's all right they got all
[48:17] tied up in business
[48:19] and didn't stop to consult god
[48:23] how many times have we done that and if
[48:25] we would just be honest today if we look
[48:27] back at the times in our lives when we
[48:29] found ourselves dry when we found
[48:31] ourselves backslid it's because we got
[48:33] caught up in business whether it was
[48:35] church business or whether it was
[48:37] business business whatever it was we got
[48:39] tied up in the busyness of life in in
[48:42] the business of life and when we did we
[48:44] stopped we don't we forget to stop
[48:47] and see lord do you want me to do this
[48:52] do you want me to be here
[48:55] do you want me
[48:57] so they left and they went out but they
[48:59] didn't pray about it
[49:02] oh my
[49:04] that seems like a simple thing
[49:06] as i told you this morning i'm very
[49:07] grieved sometimes that the lack of
[49:09] prayer
[49:11] even even in my own life and among us
[49:13] but among us as the people
[49:15] i know that we don't pray
[49:18] in public that's not what we're supposed
[49:20] to do and we're supposed to pray like he
[49:22] told us to our father which art in
[49:23] heaven we believe we have a god who
[49:25] hears our prayers
[49:26] so we pray in faith and yet
[49:29] and yet i'm grieved sometimes because i
[49:31] begin to wonder have we even prayed
[49:33] people will make life-altering decisions
[49:37] people will make decisions of things
[49:39] that will matter for the rest of their
[49:41] life and never even think to consult god
[49:45] you say but my life is predestinated yes
[49:47] it is you were predestined to pray
[49:50] you were predestined to seek the mind of
[49:52] god
[49:53] god gave you prayer as a weapon so that
[49:55] you could use it so you can again as i
[49:57] said this morning knock on the door and
[49:59] keep coming and keep knocking until the
[50:01] door comes open
[50:03] don't just presume to go and to do
[50:05] unless you prayed about it yes
[50:08] amen and so
[50:10] they got all tied up in business
[50:13] and i got to thinking about that have we
[50:15] prayed
[50:16] and i want to challenge you tonight
[50:18] as we go into this summer as we go into
[50:21] these services and the brothers that'll
[50:23] be conducting the services while we're
[50:25] gone and that's going overseas and then
[50:27] and then coming back to the meetings
[50:30] did we pray about it
[50:31] have we prayed about the meetings
[50:34] have we prayed about our services
[50:38] did we pray about the service tonight
[50:41] oh god
[50:43] have we prayed about it brother branham
[50:46] taught us he said when you come to the
[50:47] meeting if you're sick
[50:49] did you come and say now father i'm
[50:50] going down there i ask you to be
[50:52] merciful and let my faith be raised up
[50:55] to a place where i can believe your son
[50:57] and be healed yes you come to church
[50:59] like that yeah he said did you think to
[51:02] pray when you heard there was a meeting
[51:03] going on
[51:07] he said did you pray and go around get
[51:09] the neighbors
[51:10] and have little prayer meetings
[51:14] we forget those things
[51:16] and that's why we get in trouble yeah
[51:20] i know we don't again there's there's a
[51:22] balance to these things but i wonder
[51:24] sometimes sometimes i wonder if if i
[51:27] just played you the tape if you wouldn't
[51:28] get offended
[51:32] sorry
[51:34] you good people and i but i'm wondering
[51:36] myself sometimes sometimes i'll sit
[51:37] there and say brother branham i can't
[51:38] believe you said that
[51:40] but we still believe the message of the
[51:42] hour
[51:44] we still believe that it's true did we
[51:47] pray about it
[51:48] prayer still matters
[51:51] you say well i got something i need from
[51:53] god have you prayed about it
[51:55] have we prayed about it he said and we
[51:58] forget those things and so they went out
[52:00] seven days into the wilderness and we
[52:02] know that the church has been
[52:04] going for seven church ages and they
[52:07] never fetched no compass and he said it
[52:09] come to find out they got in trouble
[52:11] they went without consulting god
[52:14] and all the water supply was cut
[52:16] off now if the water supply is cut off
[52:20] there's a reason for it
[52:22] and i thank god that your spiritual
[52:24] people can understand these things
[52:25] tonight but i see when people you know
[52:28] they'll get in a rut and in a
[52:30] in a situation where they just sit and
[52:32] go to church and listen to the preaching
[52:34] and go home and go back to church and
[52:36] listen to the preaching and go home and
[52:38] there's never any move of the spirit
[52:39] there's never any move of god and i
[52:41] don't want to ever see us get stuck in
[52:43] that rut because when you get stuck in
[52:45] that rut it means you've left the water
[52:47] somewhere
[52:48] and you need to go back and find the
[52:50] water because i serve a god that that
[52:53] has a spirit that moves i serve a god
[52:56] that there's something exciting about it
[52:58] you say well it's not all about
[52:59] excitement no it's not but there's
[53:01] something exciting about the king of
[53:03] heaven coming down and the potential of
[53:05] god moving among us there's something
[53:07] that excites me about that
[53:10] and if it don't excite you to be going
[53:12] to heaven what does excite you
[53:18] if it don't make you happy to feel that
[53:21] the king of the universe has come down
[53:26] and is
[53:27] it's in your you're in his presence
[53:31] well it doesn't bother me what does
[53:35] doesn't get my attention what does
[53:39] because everybody says they're not
[53:40] emotional but they get their feelings
[53:41] hurt
[53:43] that's an emotion yeah sure
[53:47] what can move us
[53:49] yes
[53:51] what moves us i'm not talking about just
[53:53] an emotion but what can move you to a a
[53:56] closer walk with god
[53:58] what can move you to a place where you
[54:01] could cry out to god and you you won't
[54:03] stop until he answers you yes
[54:06] what can move a church to that place
[54:08] where the water supply is there again
[54:10] where we're where that tree planted by
[54:13] the rivers of water what can move us
[54:15] if the current condition doesn't make
[54:17] you pray what will
[54:19] if the world being the way it is doesn't
[54:21] make you reach out to god what will
[54:24] oh i believe we need to tonight
[54:27] oh my
[54:28] but the browner said that that was what
[54:30] was the matter with that those people
[54:32] that left is
[54:33] he said the water supply was cut off
[54:36] yeah and he said they were trying to
[54:38] carry the church on
[54:40] without the supernatural sure
[54:43] yeah
[54:44] trying to carry the church on just in
[54:47] the natural
[54:49] trying to pattern after the other
[54:52] churches of the world
[54:54] he said and that's the reason we're not
[54:55] having the blessings
[54:57] we used to have see we believe in the
[55:00] holy spirit has to be in everything we
[55:01] do
[55:04] we don't just sing the holy spirit is
[55:07] supposed to be there
[55:09] when we sing we don't just preach
[55:11] but the anointing of the holy spirit
[55:13] even if it's not a great emotion but
[55:15] there ought to be something there
[55:17] that moves you
[55:19] joked with joel i heard somebody say you
[55:21] got to run those lyrics through your
[55:23] brain
[55:25] i'm so glad i can say i'm one of them
[55:27] doesn't make you happy
[55:30] it ought to
[55:31] yeah if i'm singing i'm one of them
[55:33] you're wondering you wonder whether
[55:34] people really know what that means
[55:36] if it don't make you happy yeah i've
[55:39] been washing the blood of the lamb we
[55:41] could go on and on we've seen i'm so
[55:43] thankful i'm so glad for what god has
[55:45] done i'm so glad the lord has brought me
[55:47] out we could all those songs that we've
[55:48] seen and you look at it and people can
[55:50] sing it and it doesn't do anything it
[55:52] doesn't mean anything to them and you
[55:54] wonder you wonder are people really are
[55:56] they running the lyrics to their brain
[55:58] maybe it's not a brain problem maybe
[55:59] it's a heart problem maybe we've just
[56:01] gotten hardened to it we've become
[56:03] accustomed to it and say well god save
[56:05] me thank you for saving me no it means
[56:08] something
[56:09] when you've really been saved sure
[56:11] see we're not patterning after the
[56:13] churches of the world charles spurgeon
[56:15] also preached a sermon called make this
[56:17] valley full of ditches
[56:19] and he preached it much the way brother
[56:21] branham did if you go back and read it
[56:23] we still have the ability to read that
[56:24] today and i took just a little something
[56:27] that he said out of there he said we
[56:29] must have the aid of the holy spirit for
[56:32] ours it's not a mechanical religion
[56:35] sure
[56:36] if our worship consisted in the reading
[56:38] of forms appointed by authority
[56:42] oh my
[56:43] we could do exceedingly well without the
[56:46] assistance of the spirit of god yeah
[56:48] if that was our worship if we believed
[56:51] in the manipulations of priest craft
[56:54] and thought that after certain words and
[56:56] ceremonies all was done it would matter
[56:58] little to us
[56:59] whether we had the conscious presence of
[57:01] god
[57:02] if we could regenerate by water
[57:07] if all i had to do was baptize people it
[57:09] wouldn't matter if the holy spirit was
[57:10] there or not sure if that would save
[57:13] them if that alone would save them
[57:16] if we if all we had to do was baptize
[57:19] people
[57:19] applied by oil applied by the hands of
[57:22] apostolical succession we should have no
[57:24] particular need to pray for the holy
[57:27] ghost
[57:28] and if the utterance of certain words
[57:31] could turn bread into wine
[57:33] and spurgeon said this he said oh
[57:35] horrible dog man
[57:37] into the flesh and blood of the lord
[57:39] jesus christ
[57:41] we could wondrously well afford to
[57:43] dispense with the spirit of god see if
[57:45] there was a formula if let me update a
[57:47] little bit if listening to a tape
[57:50] was our religion
[57:53] we wouldn't need the holy ghost
[57:56] let me go a little bit further if
[57:58] listening to your pastor
[58:00] amen was enough
[58:02] amen you wouldn't need the holy ghost
[58:06] if all you had to do was attend church
[58:08] if it was a formula if i attend church
[58:10] if i pay my tithes if i do what's right
[58:12] then i'll make it to heaven if it was a
[58:14] formula we wouldn't need the holy ghost
[58:17] but we do need the holy ghost because
[58:19] it's not a formula but it's a life yeah
[58:22] all right
[58:24] hey are you with me tonight
[58:26] amen
[58:28] he said now i'm not going to keep you
[58:30] long tonight because i can't
[58:32] i just physically can't but the lord
[58:34] knows but we you know god god has a way
[58:37] of giving us what we need you believe
[58:38] that tonight
[58:40] he said
[58:41] if we we cannot thus deceive ourselves
[58:44] ours is not a religion of mechanics and
[58:46] hydrostatics
[58:48] it is spiritual it must be sustained by
[58:51] spiritual means
[58:53] if our religion were mere
[58:55] intellectualism
[58:56] we should only need a well-trained
[58:58] minister who had passed through all the
[59:00] grades of human learning who had who had
[59:02] made himself the best biblical criticism
[59:05] was able to instruct and eliminate our
[59:06] earnings our understandings and if we be
[59:09] men of judgment ourselves we could
[59:10] profit exceedingly well
[59:12] our faith standing in the wisdom of man
[59:14] the wisdom of man could easily be found
[59:17] and our faith could be confirmed
[59:19] but if my brethren our faith stands not
[59:22] in the wisdom of man or in the eloquence
[59:23] of human limbs but in the power of god
[59:26] then in vain do we make a profession
[59:28] unless the holy ghost dwelleth
[59:31] in our inner man
[59:33] oh we need him don't we
[59:36] we need him
[59:38] and even those who go off without him
[59:40] they recognize
[59:41] yes something's wrong that's right
[59:44] but they'll go off and they'll say well
[59:45] it must just must be a different hour
[59:48] must be no you went off without him
[59:51] the reason you don't have it is because
[59:52] you went off without him it's not
[59:54] because he's not still doing that he's a
[59:56] good father as we said this morning he
[59:59] gives his his inheritance goes to his
[1:00:01] children's children
[1:00:03] we we are those who can receive the
[1:00:05] baptism of the holy ghost so but in
[1:00:06] second kings 3 10 the king of israel
[1:00:08] said alas that the lord hath called
[1:00:10] these three kings together to deliver
[1:00:13] them into the hand of moab so in other
[1:00:14] words let's let's blame it on god he's
[1:00:17] just not doing that anymore
[1:00:19] he don't work that way anymore
[1:00:22] but jehoshaphat said is there not here a
[1:00:24] prophet of the lord yes oh i love this
[1:00:27] let's find out what a prophet has to say
[1:00:29] about the situation yes
[1:00:32] is there not a prophet of the lord i
[1:00:34] would say well maybe it's supposed to be
[1:00:35] this way maybe god brought us out here
[1:00:37] just to leave us maybe the bride's not
[1:00:39] going to make it maybe there's not going
[1:00:41] to be a rapture is there a prophet of
[1:00:43] the lord
[1:00:45] are you with me tonight yeah is there a
[1:00:47] prophet of the lord here
[1:00:49] that we may inquire of the lord by him
[1:00:52] and one of the king of the israel's
[1:00:53] servants answered and said here is
[1:00:55] elisha the son of shephard which poured
[1:00:57] water on the hands
[1:00:59] of elijah now god always has a man let
[1:01:02] me believe that today
[1:01:04] god always has a man and he had a man
[1:01:07] named elisha
[1:01:09] now elisha had poured water he was a
[1:01:11] marvelous prophet he had a double
[1:01:14] portion of elijah's spirit
[1:01:17] and elijah was the old prophet he
[1:01:19] represented christ
[1:01:21] and elisha brother branham said
[1:01:22] represents the church
[1:01:25] the young prophet
[1:01:26] in second kings chapter two and verse
[1:01:28] one we find where elijah and elisha
[1:01:31] remember elijah goes and calls elisha
[1:01:33] away from his farm work and he goes and
[1:01:35] he follows him and it come to pass that
[1:01:37] the lord when the lord would take up
[1:01:39] elijah into heaven by a whirlwind that
[1:01:41] elijah went with elisha from gilgal and
[1:01:44] elijah said unto elisha terry here i
[1:01:46] pray thee for the lord hath sent me to
[1:01:48] bethel and elisha said unto him as the
[1:01:51] lord liveth and as thy soul liveth i
[1:01:53] will not leave thee
[1:01:54] so they went down to bethel
[1:01:57] and elijah said unto him
[1:01:59] we'll skip to verse four elijah said to
[1:02:01] him elisha terry here i pray thee the
[1:02:03] lord has sent me to jericho he said as
[1:02:05] the lord liveth and as i so liveth i
[1:02:07] will not leave thee so they came to
[1:02:09] jericho and you have to have an
[1:02:10] understanding when the prophet says
[1:02:12] something of what he's saying
[1:02:14] sure
[1:02:16] i'm sorry hon i'm going to take this off
[1:02:19] my wife told me not to take my jacket
[1:02:21] off tonight
[1:02:22] because my shirts wrinkled but y'all get
[1:02:24] over that
[1:02:29] i'm hot
[1:02:33] y'all not hot cause you're not working
[1:02:34] you come up here
[1:02:38] elijah said to elisha terry here
[1:02:41] now you know if people have quotes
[1:02:44] but is your does your quote fit
[1:02:46] the hour that you live in
[1:02:49] now think about it because he had a
[1:02:51] quote stay here yeah and a lot of people
[1:02:53] would have just stayed okay we'll stay
[1:02:55] here i got a quote for it
[1:02:57] but that's not what god wanted him to do
[1:02:59] right he was supposed to keep his eye on
[1:03:00] that prophet yeah
[1:03:02] right now he says stay here as the lord
[1:03:04] liveth as i so live with i will not
[1:03:06] leave thee so they came to jericho verse
[1:03:07] six and elijah said to him terry i pray
[1:03:10] thee here for the lord has sent me to
[1:03:12] jordan he said as the lord liveth and as
[1:03:13] i so liveth i will not leave thee and
[1:03:15] they too went on
[1:03:17] and verse 7 says in 50 men of the sons
[1:03:19] of the prophets went and stood to view
[1:03:21] afar of and they too stood by jordan so
[1:03:24] here's the here's the prophet here's the
[1:03:27] church
[1:03:28] here's the old prophet here's the new
[1:03:30] prophet which he said represents the
[1:03:31] church he said and elijah took his
[1:03:33] mantle and wrapped it together and smote
[1:03:36] the waters and they were divided hither
[1:03:38] and the others so that they too went
[1:03:40] over on dry ground and it came to pass
[1:03:43] when they were gone over so he sees him
[1:03:45] do this supernatural miracle
[1:03:47] he sees him do it
[1:03:50] but now watch he said the elijah said to
[1:03:52] elisha ask what i shall do for thee so
[1:03:53] they crossed the jordan you remember
[1:03:55] what i told you the other day brother
[1:03:57] brown sees the vision of himself
[1:03:58] standing on the map of israel he said
[1:04:01] i'm two-thirds of the way there
[1:04:03] remember in 1961 i'm two-thirds of the
[1:04:06] way there and there was the jordan but
[1:04:08] now we've come into the land of promises
[1:04:10] yes how many believe that today yeah
[1:04:13] we're in we're under the third pole
[1:04:15] we're under the opening of the word
[1:04:16] that's what we believe
[1:04:18] and so we're in the land of promises so
[1:04:20] elisha crosses over with elijah crosses
[1:04:23] over the jordan and then he said ask
[1:04:25] what i shall do for thee now notice he
[1:04:27] didn't say now here's what i'm going to
[1:04:28] do for you he said you ask
[1:04:32] amen but you've got to have a desire
[1:04:34] hold church we've got to have a desire
[1:04:36] to serve god we got to have a desire to
[1:04:38] hear the word we got to have a desire i
[1:04:40] want my kids to have a desire to come to
[1:04:42] church
[1:04:43] not because they're afraid daddy will
[1:04:45] beat them if they don't come not because
[1:04:46] they're afraid i'll i'll get on to them
[1:04:48] if they don't come but i want them to
[1:04:50] have a desire
[1:04:52] i want them to want to be in the house
[1:04:53] of god
[1:04:54] i want you to want to be in the house of
[1:04:56] god i know there's something inside of
[1:04:58] me though i'm tired and weary but i want
[1:05:01] to be in the house of the lord why is
[1:05:03] that for the herald it's something down
[1:05:04] on the inside god put it there but he
[1:05:07] wants you to express it ask
[1:05:09] what i shall do for thee before i'd be
[1:05:12] taken away from thee and elisha said i
[1:05:13] pray that you let a double portion of
[1:05:14] thy spirit be upon me
[1:05:16] oh my
[1:05:18] he said you've asked a hard thing
[1:05:21] nevertheless if you see me when i'm
[1:05:22] taken from thee
[1:05:24] it shall be so unto thee
[1:05:26] but if not it shall not be so enough
[1:05:28] he'd have stayed in guild golf he'd
[1:05:29] stayed in jericho he'd never seen him
[1:05:32] but the fact that he went with him
[1:05:35] crossed over jordan with him he didn't
[1:05:37] stay in his first poll or the second
[1:05:39] poll he went with him come on
[1:05:41] yeah amen and he crossed over jordan
[1:05:43] with him and now he's on the other side
[1:05:45] and he said you've asked a hard thing
[1:05:48] and it came to pass verse 11 as they
[1:05:49] still went on and talked behold there
[1:05:52] appeared a chariot of fire
[1:05:53] and horses of fire and parted them both
[1:05:56] asunder and elijah went up by a
[1:05:58] whirlwind into heaven and elisha saw it
[1:06:00] and he cried my father my father the
[1:06:03] chariot of israel the horsemen thereof
[1:06:05] and he saw him no more
[1:06:08] he didn't come back
[1:06:09] the sons of the prophets thought he
[1:06:11] would and they waited on him but he
[1:06:12] didn't come back yeah
[1:06:14] he didn't come back he saw him no more
[1:06:15] he took hold of his own clothes and rent
[1:06:17] them in two pieces
[1:06:19] he took up also the mantle of elijah
[1:06:21] that fell from him and went back and
[1:06:23] stood by the bank of jordan
[1:06:25] oh i love it where all the promises lay
[1:06:27] yes that's what brother brandon said and
[1:06:29] he took the mantle of elijah that fell
[1:06:31] from him and smote the waters
[1:06:34] and he did not say where is elijah
[1:06:37] but he said where is the lord god of
[1:06:39] elijah
[1:06:41] and when also it spent in the waters
[1:06:43] they parted hither and the tether and
[1:06:44] elisha went over
[1:06:46] notice he said ask what you will and
[1:06:49] i'll do it yes
[1:06:51] and brother branham tells us in that
[1:06:53] sermon uh in the in the sermon that i
[1:06:55] was taking this from he tells them
[1:06:58] about the digging the ditches he wasn't
[1:07:00] afraid to ask
[1:07:02] elisha wasn't afraid that's why he was
[1:07:03] the man for the hour he wasn't afraid to
[1:07:05] ask he said i want a double portion of
[1:07:08] your spirit he said ask abundantly ask
[1:07:10] for great things believe for great
[1:07:12] things how many could do that tonight
[1:07:14] yes
[1:07:15] elijah took that man and walked down to
[1:07:17] the jordan stood there and the school of
[1:07:19] prophet said over there looking at him
[1:07:21] to see what he'd do and he took that
[1:07:22] mantle and doubled it back and forth and
[1:07:24] struck old jordan and said where is the
[1:07:26] god of elijah she divided one way and
[1:07:28] the other way a beautiful type of the
[1:07:30] church he said has come down through the
[1:07:31] lutheran age the method of stage the
[1:07:32] pentecost stage and now crossing the
[1:07:35] jordan yes
[1:07:36] amen
[1:07:38] notice when jesus and his disciples were
[1:07:40] about to go into the holy ghost
[1:07:42] dispensation he gathered them and he
[1:07:44] blessed them and and he said terry you
[1:07:46] in the city of jerusalem until you're
[1:07:48] endued with power from on high
[1:07:50] he told them that the things that i do
[1:07:52] show you also and greater this so you do
[1:07:54] and a double portion was promised there
[1:07:57] to the church
[1:07:58] and they went into the upper room and
[1:08:01] stayed until the day jesus was taken up
[1:08:04] and the same baptism the holy ghost that
[1:08:06] he had on him fell on the pentecostal
[1:08:08] people yes
[1:08:10] right
[1:08:11] that's the double portion
[1:08:13] and brother madam says this he said you

[1:08:17] cup of the golden blessings of god we
[1:08:20] we claim a lot

[1:08:55] us an anointing that we can do the
[1:08:57] greater works yes
[1:08:59] it's what we claim
[1:09:01] right that's what we claim we claim that
[1:09:05] and if we claim he said if you kiss the
[1:09:07] rim of the cup with the golden blessings
[1:09:08] of god

[1:09:38] rejoicing or or enthused about there
[1:09:41] being a
[1:09:42] pentecostal revival in 1906 we're not
[1:09:45] excited over speaking in tongues and all
[1:09:47] those things though those are wonderful

[1:09:51] kissed the rim of the cup with the
[1:09:52] golden blessings of god who can sit
[1:09:55] still in such a day
[1:09:58] hey man all they claimed to have was the
[1:10:00] restoration of the gifts but what we
[1:10:01] have
[1:10:02] is a restoration of all things yes

[1:10:13] still when you have a double portion
[1:10:15] listen he said where is the god that was
[1:10:17] on jesus christ where is he that's what

[1:10:23] elijah we can stand there and say where
[1:10:25] is the god of william branham
[1:10:27] where is the god that was on jesus
[1:10:29] christ yes

[1:10:37] where is he
[1:10:39] hey man he's going to make himself known
[1:10:40] i believe that
[1:10:42] where is he where is the god that was on
[1:10:44] jesus christ where is the one who knew
[1:10:45] the thoughts of the people's mind
[1:10:48] oh my
[1:10:49] and said the things that i do show you
[1:10:51] also
[1:10:52] and he said the baptism i'm baptized
[1:10:54] with you'll be baptized with the same in
[1:10:56] a double portion yes where is the god
[1:10:58] that was on jesus christ yes brother
[1:11:00] madam said he's here yes
[1:11:03] sweeping over this building right
[1:11:04] tonight yes
[1:11:06] yes sir oh do we realize that church
[1:11:09] can we recognize it we're not waiting on
[1:11:11] him to come where is the god of elijah
[1:11:13] he's here he's here on a sunday night
[1:11:16] he's here on a wednesday night he's here
[1:11:17] to meet your need
[1:11:19] do we believe that church
[1:11:22] he's here amen he's here sweeping over
[1:11:25] the building do we believe it the same
[1:11:27] holy ghost
[1:11:29] he said the trouble of it is you felt it
[1:11:31] yeah and you knew his presence is here
[1:11:34] but you're afraid to turn loose to it
[1:11:36] yes
[1:11:37] that's right
[1:11:48] if i think i'm pentecostal
[1:11:53] let them think what they want
[1:11:56] once you've tasted the grapes yes you
[1:11:58] can't go back and never be happy
[1:12:03] but the others went in because they
[1:12:04] tasted them with a spirit of doubt
[1:12:06] remember they all all 12 uh spies went
[1:12:09] into the land they all tasted the grapes
[1:12:12] but 12 of them or 10 of them rather came
[1:12:14] back with a bad report why did they come
[1:12:16] back with that report with an evil
[1:12:18] report because they tasted it but they
[1:12:20] didn't taste it in faith
[1:12:23] they didn't taste it thinking there's
[1:12:24] more where that come from
[1:12:26] they tasted and said well that was a
[1:12:28] good service but we better not go too
[1:12:29] far
[1:12:31] well that was pretty good but we don't
[1:12:32] want no we don't want no emotionalism
[1:12:34] around here that was pretty good but we
[1:12:36] don't we don't want to get into the word
[1:12:37] of the hour because we might get in
[1:12:39] trouble we might get it wrong how can we
[1:12:41] get it wrong when the holy spirit the
[1:12:43] writer or the author of the word is
[1:12:44] right here with us yes oh yeah many have
[1:12:47] gotten it wrong but why did they get it
[1:12:48] wrong they left him back there somewhere
[1:12:50] yes
[1:12:52] amen right the trouble is you're afraid
[1:12:54] to turn loose to it
[1:12:58] and then you begin to condemn something
[1:13:00] that you've never tried
[1:13:01] yeah
[1:13:03] sure
[1:13:05] you've never even turned yourself loose
[1:13:06] to it but you begin to condemn it
[1:13:09] second kings three and twelve joshua
[1:13:10] said the word of the lord is with him do
[1:13:12] we believe that today
[1:13:14] we still have a prophet
[1:13:15] the prophet of the hour william branham
[1:13:18] him in the word of the lord is with him
[1:13:20] so the king of israel and jehoshaphat
[1:13:21] and the king of edom went down to him
[1:13:23] and elisha said unto the king of israel
[1:13:25] what have i to do with thee
[1:13:27] get thee to the prophets of thy father
[1:13:29] the prophets of thy mother
[1:13:30] and the king of israel said unto him
[1:13:32] name but the lord hath called these
[1:13:34] three kings together to deliver them
[1:13:35] into the hand of moab
[1:13:38] can't be no bride revival
[1:13:40] we're just going down
[1:13:42] can't do nothing about it
[1:13:45] and elisha said it's the lord of hosts
[1:13:47] liveth if it was just you too
[1:13:49] yeah
[1:13:51] i wouldn't look at you he said if it
[1:13:52] wasn't for the presence of jehoshaphat
[1:13:55] now remember jehoshaphat went down there
[1:13:57] with them he was backslid with them
[1:13:59] sure he went down there without the
[1:14:01] water but he was god's elect
[1:14:05] amen he was the king
[1:14:07] in david's line
[1:14:09] are you hearing me now the other one was
[1:14:12] a usurper a denominational usurper but
[1:14:15] here was the presence of the elect and
[1:14:17] so elisha said i wouldn't even speak
[1:14:20] i wouldn't even i wouldn't even regard
[1:14:22] you
[1:14:23] do you realize why the message came it
[1:14:25] wasn't just for them
[1:14:27] it was for us yes
[1:14:30] amen he said if it wasn't for
[1:14:32] jehoshaphat i wouldn't even regard you i
[1:14:34] wouldn't look toward thee nor see thee
[1:14:36] yes but now
[1:14:38] bring me a minstrel
[1:14:40] and it came to pass when the minstrel
[1:14:42] played that the hand of the lord
[1:14:44] came upon him
[1:14:46] now what about you people don't believe
[1:14:47] in music in the church
[1:14:51] what about that
[1:14:53] the minstrel began to play and spirit
[1:14:55] came on the prophet
[1:14:56] if music helped bring the spirit on a
[1:14:58] prophet it'll do the same thing tonight
[1:15:01] sure
[1:15:03] he said thus saith the lord
[1:15:05] make this valley full
[1:15:07] of ditches yes
[1:15:09] for thus saith the lord now there's a
[1:15:11] reason why you're going to make the
[1:15:12] valley full of ditches
[1:15:14] brother bran told told us in different
[1:15:16] places when he preached this sermon he
[1:15:18] said that elisha caught a vision
[1:15:21] of the rock
[1:15:25] that moses had in the wilderness yeah
[1:15:28] he said that rock was still putting out
[1:15:30] water yeah
[1:15:32] hallelujah
[1:15:34] and the problem was not a lack of water
[1:15:38] because the rock was still in the desert
[1:15:40] [Music]
[1:15:42] but the problem was
[1:15:44] they didn't have no vessels
[1:15:46] right
[1:15:47] they didn't have any ditches
[1:15:50] for the water to flow through right
[1:15:53] now watch the problem today is not a
[1:15:55] lack of water he said thus said lord you
[1:15:56] shall not see wind
[1:15:58] neither shall you see rain
[1:16:00] there's not another prophet coming
[1:16:02] not another great sweeping revival
[1:16:06] right
[1:16:06] but that valley will be filled with
[1:16:08] water yes yes
[1:16:11] oh i could preach for a while on that
[1:16:14] you're not going to see anything
[1:16:17] but he said don't despise the day of
[1:16:18] small things in an age when when it's
[1:16:22] not going to be a public show yeah
[1:16:25] but during that time yes
[1:16:28] oh my
[1:16:29] after you've gone on for seven ages and
[1:16:31] the church has gone without water but
[1:16:33] during that time there's still a rock
[1:16:35] yes
[1:16:36] in the desert and you won't see rain you
[1:16:39] you won't see any wind you won't see a
[1:16:41] thunderstorm but there'll be water in
[1:16:43] the ditches
[1:16:46] nothing you could drink in your cattle
[1:16:49] and your beasts
[1:16:51] and the spirit of the lord came on him
[1:16:54] began to look around he said thus saith
[1:16:55] the lord
[1:16:57] get out there and get to digging ditches
[1:17:02] you know why preaching is hard work
[1:17:05] it's not hard because you get to stand
[1:17:07] up here and talk to people that's not
[1:17:08] what's hard about it it's hard because
[1:17:10] you're digging
[1:17:14] you're digging ditches now i went up
[1:17:16] here the other day to the barbecue place
[1:17:18] down here to see if we still had a we're
[1:17:19] going to get some barbecue for the
[1:17:20] meetings one day at the meetings i won't
[1:17:22] tell you which day so you'll know you
[1:17:24] have to show up to all of it but
[1:17:27] we're getting some barbecue down here
[1:17:28] bob and sandy's i went down there and
[1:17:30] they just dug a fresh ditch and i've
[1:17:32] been studying on these things i've been
[1:17:33] up here praying and
[1:17:35] and just just just kind of looking at
[1:17:37] these things i didn't really write much
[1:17:39] down i just took everything i've said
[1:17:40] tonight just comes out that one book
[1:17:43] and and i i was beginning to think about
[1:17:45] and i went down there and they just dug
[1:17:47] a ditch across the top of that hill now
[1:17:48] if you've ever been up on that hill
[1:17:49] that's rocky man
[1:17:51] that's that's some hard digging
[1:17:53] and i got to looking at that and it was
[1:17:55] 100 degrees i got to think about danny
[1:17:57] and there was a there was a track or
[1:17:59] something sitting out there they'd been
[1:18:00] digging that with and i got
[1:18:01] thinking what if i had to dig that with
[1:18:03] a shovel
[1:18:06] number one you never dig that on top of
[1:18:08] this hill
[1:18:10] it'd just be nearly impossible
[1:18:12] you're digging in a dry country now the
[1:18:14] israeli desert was much like that it's a
[1:18:16] lot like the land around here it's
[1:18:18] really it's really rocky it's not a
[1:18:21] desert sand where you could dig in the
[1:18:22] sand but it's a really rocky hard kind
[1:18:25] of a place in that place where they were
[1:18:27] it's very difficult to dig
[1:18:30] it's like solid rock
[1:18:32] and so he's telling them he's not
[1:18:33] telling them to do an easy thing
[1:18:37] now remember they might have looked back
[1:18:38] at that and said lord elisha if we start
[1:18:41] digging our people are all going to be
[1:18:42] wore out they don't have no water anyway
[1:18:45] they got nothing to drink and they're
[1:18:46] going to be digging out there in the
[1:18:47] desert sun for hours
[1:18:50] digging ditches
[1:18:52] where there's no water
[1:18:54] you see the hard work of revival
[1:18:57] is done on sunday nights like this
[1:19:01] when you're digging
[1:19:03] it's done on wednesday nights when you
[1:19:05] don't feel like going to church
[1:19:08] but you go anyway yeah the the difficult
[1:19:11] work
[1:19:12] is done at home when you don't feel like
[1:19:15] pulling out your bible and getting your
[1:19:17] children around but you do it anyway
[1:19:19] the difficult work of revival is done
[1:19:22] when you're digging
[1:19:24] yes
[1:19:25] and so he said thus saith the lord go
[1:19:28] dig ditches yeah he didn't tell him to
[1:19:30] go find water
[1:19:32] water would already be there at the
[1:19:34] appointed time yes but go dig ditches
[1:19:37] now he promised us he said where two or
[1:19:38] three are gathered together in my name
[1:19:40] there am i in the midst
[1:19:42] yeah right in other words he's saying
[1:19:44] i'm already there
[1:19:46] because the two or three are there
[1:19:48] wherever they are i'm there right but
[1:19:50] you got to dig some ditches
[1:19:53] he said brother i'm telling you
[1:19:56] they went to digging
[1:19:58] now here's where it gets hard
[1:20:00] how's it going to come
[1:20:02] there ain't going to be no rain
[1:20:04] that's god's business to take care of
[1:20:06] that
[1:20:07] it's your business to dig ditches
[1:20:12] people have given up digging ditches
[1:20:16] yes
[1:20:17] i'm just preaching to you tonight people
[1:20:19] have given up digging ditches why they
[1:20:20] don't pray no more yeah they don't
[1:20:22] really seek the mind of god anymore
[1:20:24] they've given up digging ditches doing
[1:20:26] the hard work
[1:20:28] doing the sweaty work
[1:20:31] doing the work that makes you smell bad
[1:20:33] to the world they quit digging ditches
[1:20:37] and so when they quit digging ditches
[1:20:39] everybody just the church went on and
[1:20:41] the people went on but there's nothing
[1:20:43] there for the water to flow through
[1:20:45] right so you have a meeting and it just
[1:20:47] all runs off the top yeah
[1:20:49] the rock's there but there's nothing for
[1:20:52] the water because there's going to come
[1:20:53] a day when you're not in the meeting
[1:20:54] anymore you need the ditches to keep the
[1:20:57] water in
[1:21:01] you need a ditch to keep the water in
[1:21:03] and every time you go to a meeting you
[1:21:04] feel enthused and you go home but you
[1:21:06] haven't dug any ditches
[1:21:08] and so the water just runs off that's i
[1:21:10] don't want that to happen we're going to
[1:21:12] have some preachers in here and these
[1:21:13] brothers from here from the church are
[1:21:14] going to preach for you and then we're
[1:21:16] going to have a meeting and we'll be
[1:21:17] coming back from overseas i'm sure
[1:21:19] there'll be excitement and there'll be
[1:21:20] other brothers and people here but let
[1:21:22] us dig ditches now
[1:21:26] all right so we can see god come in our
[1:21:28] midst and it'll do something yes
[1:21:32] i'm tired of having a good service and
[1:21:34] going home and everything falls apart
[1:21:36] yeah i'm tired of seeing people come for
[1:21:38] a while and then begin to fade away
[1:21:41] and enthused for a while and begin to
[1:21:43] fade away but there's got to be
[1:21:44] something that has staying power
[1:21:47] there's got to be a water there's water
[1:21:49] in the desert start digging ditches and
[1:21:51] you begin to see it
[1:21:52] when you start doing the hard work with
[1:21:54] your family
[1:21:56] doing the difficult stuff
[1:21:58] yes that's when that's when god can fill
[1:22:00] up your ditch yes
[1:22:02] amen
[1:22:03] they went to digging and some of them
[1:22:05] said well i've got the digger but the
[1:22:07] deeper you go the more water you're
[1:22:08] going to have
[1:22:13] several times i was a kid i was going to
[1:22:15] divert a stream i remember we had a
[1:22:17] little stream running out there i think
[1:22:18] it was really a sewer but we played in
[1:22:20] it anyway
[1:22:21] a little stream running out there by the
[1:22:23] house and
[1:22:24] good worms come out of that we caught
[1:22:25] our fish and ate the fish
[1:22:27] it's two degrees removed from the sewer
[1:22:29] so
[1:22:30] we go out there and dig and that water
[1:22:32] come out of there and we we divert it
[1:22:34] but you know you you never dug a very
[1:22:35] deep hole because it's too much work
[1:22:40] and the water never stayed
[1:22:42] when the hot sun came it began to dry up
[1:22:44] why it's not deep enough
[1:22:47] but if you dig a ditch deep enough there
[1:22:48] will be water on monday
[1:22:51] water on tuesday
[1:22:53] water on wednesday
[1:22:55] some of y'all come to church on
[1:22:56] wednesday night the way you do because
[1:22:58] you haven't been digging ditches
[1:23:02] don't been done digging been going on
[1:23:03] there in the week and that's why what's
[1:23:05] the wednesday night sometimes so hard i
[1:23:06] know it's difficult sometimes i'm not
[1:23:08] getting on to your church but i just in
[1:23:09] my own heart i said lord help me to be a
[1:23:11] digger of ditches help me to be somebody
[1:23:14] that does the hard work i don't need the
[1:23:15] glory but let me get out there and sweat
[1:23:18] let me get out there in the heat let me
[1:23:19] get out there and do the praying let me
[1:23:21] get out there and do the and do the prep
[1:23:23] work
[1:23:25] let me get ready for the service
[1:23:27] let me dig the ditches
[1:23:32] hallelujah he said the water come out of
[1:23:34] that rock
[1:23:36] that rock has said that god so loved the
[1:23:38] world that he gave his only begotten son
[1:23:40] that whosoever believeth in him should
[1:23:42] not perish a perishing people lived
[1:23:44] because of water from the smitten rock
[1:23:47] and he's a smitten rock to a perishing
[1:23:49] people the only hope of life
[1:23:51] that there is
[1:23:52] but brother madison the trouble of it is
[1:23:54] is you go to digging
[1:23:56] and the first thing you know you stick
[1:23:57] your shovel down and it you ever heard
[1:23:59] that sound clank
[1:24:02] oh no there's rock can you move
[1:24:04] [Laughter]
[1:24:07] unless you have to dig there
[1:24:10] well i just
[1:24:11] you gotta go get a jackhammer you gotta
[1:24:12] get something to break the rock
[1:24:15] why
[1:24:16] because you you got to have a hole for
[1:24:19] the water to be there
[1:24:20] what god wants is some ditches yes
[1:24:24] look
[1:24:25] but you dig down brother brown said the
[1:24:26] problem is you dig down you hit that
[1:24:27] rock it says pay ten percent
[1:24:31] yeah
[1:24:34] i'm not preaching on tithing tonight but
[1:24:36] that's what the prophet said
[1:24:37] that's the example he is
[1:24:40] dick 10 he said well i better just move
[1:24:42] on there believe that's deep enough
[1:24:46] you go hit that rock you start digging
[1:24:48] and you hit the rock and you hit maybe
[1:24:50] an old can or old piece of piece of
[1:24:52] metal been put in there from your
[1:24:54] childhood
[1:24:55] i said god don't move like that no more
[1:24:58] you're digging but you put that you
[1:25:00] begin to put that in and say well
[1:25:02] might as well just leave it there it'll
[1:25:03] keep the water from filling up
[1:25:06] sure
[1:25:07] you gotta dig that thing out
[1:25:10] you start digging the rocks you the
[1:25:12] problem is you'll only be blessed in
[1:25:14] this hour as much as you can receive the
[1:25:16] word
[1:25:17] you can only get a deep enough ditch as
[1:25:20] you can cope with the message of the
[1:25:22] hour
[1:25:23] so if you're doing things in your life
[1:25:24] that you know is wrong
[1:25:26] yeah
[1:25:27] sure
[1:25:28] the problems we have is not the things
[1:25:30] we don't know about but it's the things
[1:25:31] we do know about
[1:25:33] and if we're doing things and we try to
[1:25:35] justify them well i believe in grace and
[1:25:37] that's wonderful i believe in grace too
[1:25:39] but grace gives you the power to live
[1:25:41] the word
[1:25:42] and if you get to a place where you've
[1:25:44] dug down and you've hit that clink it's
[1:25:46] time to keep digging that's when you got
[1:25:48] to do the hard work that's when you need
[1:25:50] to get down to business with god and say
[1:25:52] lord if you said it i'm going to believe
[1:25:54] it i'm not going to question it i'm not
[1:25:55] going to doubt it i'm going to believe
[1:25:57] it
[1:25:58] you said for me to do it i'm going to do
[1:26:00] it
[1:26:01] you told me not to do it i won't do it
[1:26:04] it's that simple
[1:26:06] but things like that but the brand said
[1:26:08] oh dish pans and rocks and stones
[1:26:10] yes and he goes through in that hour and
[1:26:12] he goes through all kinds of different
[1:26:13] things the way the women dressed and and
[1:26:15] the way the people did he goes through
[1:26:17] all that and calls it names those rocks
[1:26:20] but i believe that you're spiritual
[1:26:21] enough people today that you can go
[1:26:23] yourself
[1:26:24] and find out what all those rocks are
[1:26:27] maybe it's a little doubt that you've
[1:26:28] allowed to stay in your in your mind yes
[1:26:31] maybe a little uh that that depressing
[1:26:34] depressing spirit that you you kind of
[1:26:36] dwell in that when you leave church and
[1:26:38] when you're not around the people of god
[1:26:39] you just kind of settle into that low
[1:26:41] and you just dwell there you need to get
[1:26:43] that rock out of the way
[1:26:47] those little spirits that come in and
[1:26:49] and and you don't really you know you
[1:26:51] think well there's no harm in it but
[1:26:52] brother branham preached against it
[1:26:54] yeah
[1:26:56] there's no harm in it but it's a rock
[1:26:59] and sometimes it thinks it's not even
[1:27:01] sin it's just junk yeah
[1:27:07] but brother batter said if you'll keep
[1:27:09] on digging brother and keep on digging
[1:27:11] dig them old doubts out
[1:27:13] dig them on dish pans and rocks and
[1:27:15] stones and things dig deep enough to
[1:27:17] throw it all out
[1:27:18] and get enough water flowing through
[1:27:20] there so you can get a good decent drink
[1:27:22] once in a while yes
[1:27:24] oh my he said you got to dig away from
[1:27:26] your church
[1:27:28] all right
[1:27:29] and what you can't let your church hold
[1:27:31] you back from digging ditches
[1:27:32] well everybody else does it doesn't make
[1:27:34] it right
[1:27:35] right
[1:27:37] everybody else does that same way that i
[1:27:39] do everybody else does the same things
[1:27:41] that i do don't make it right
[1:27:43] you got to dig away from your church dig
[1:27:46] away from this stick away from that dig
[1:27:48] into christ jesus
[1:27:49] i'm not telling you to do things that
[1:27:51] are that are just legalistic uh
[1:27:53] things that people have added to the
[1:27:54] word i'm talking about this
[1:27:56] dig down to you can cope with this
[1:27:59] dig into christ
[1:28:02] you see digging in the desert is hard
[1:28:03] work as we said you get sweaty and you
[1:28:05] get tired
[1:28:07] but i want to ask you tonight
[1:28:09] these musicians would come
[1:28:11] we'll close the service are you willing
[1:28:12] to dig
[1:28:16] and i had to come to terms with this
[1:28:17] myself this week
[1:28:22] because i don't like doing new things i
[1:28:24] like doing things other people have done
[1:28:27] because you see it at work you know
[1:28:29] i don't like making waves
[1:28:32] we're about to go to a part of the world
[1:28:33] that i'm very many people go to
[1:28:36] and we face some resistance and things
[1:28:38] some different things have happened and
[1:28:39] it's not a it's not a real comfortable
[1:28:41] place to be
[1:28:43] and i got to thinking about that but am
[1:28:45] i willing to dig
[1:28:48] and find out if it's the will of god
[1:28:50] am i willing to dig
[1:28:52] and i've just been digging down into
[1:28:54] that and
[1:28:55] what's stopping up the water and i would
[1:28:56] ask you tonight are you willing to dig
[1:28:58] i'm not telling you to do one thing or
[1:29:00] not do but are you willing to dig
[1:29:03] are you willing to cope with the word
[1:29:04] are there certain tapes you can't listen
[1:29:06] to
[1:29:07] because it bothers you
[1:29:09] have an evangelist come in once in a
[1:29:11] while and there's things that he says
[1:29:12] and maybe and it just oh you you just
[1:29:14] can't hardly take that it's a rock
[1:29:18] it's in the way
[1:29:21] you can't be blessed by the service
[1:29:22] because you've got a perception of
[1:29:24] something that's wrong
[1:29:26] see if it's the word or not
[1:29:28] throw away the rocks digging to christ
[1:29:32] are you willing to dig what's stopping
[1:29:33] up the water
[1:29:35] and all of us know him not all of us are
[1:29:37] the same level as far as we don't all
[1:29:39] emote in the same way we don't all have
[1:29:41] the same
[1:29:42] same
[1:29:43] response to the word but we ought to
[1:29:45] have a response
[1:29:49] are you digging enough what's keeping
[1:29:51] you from being able to enjoy the
[1:29:52] services
[1:29:54] you say well it's the song leader or
[1:29:56] it's the preacher or something else
[1:29:57] what's keeping you
[1:29:59] from being able to enjoy the presence of
[1:30:01] god you know he's here you felt him
[1:30:04] what's keeping you from being able to
[1:30:06] enjoy i know this is kind of an
[1:30:08] evangelistic service tonight but i just
[1:30:10] i want it to be that i want us to just
[1:30:12] really think and and just kind of dig
[1:30:14] down in our own hearts what's stopping
[1:30:16] it up is it worldliness
[1:30:18] is it social media
[1:30:23] what's stopping it up i'm on social
[1:30:24] media i've got several social media
[1:30:26] accounts
[1:30:27] and sometimes
[1:30:29] i gotta
[1:30:30] i gotta take them off and i'll tell you
[1:30:31] with this
[1:30:33] you got to get you got to dig down until
[1:30:34] you get the rock
[1:30:36] of pride out
[1:30:38] or the rock or the social media will
[1:30:39] come back
[1:30:42] and what i mean is it's hold over you
[1:30:45] because it's not the thing itself that's
[1:30:47] the problem the thing is you got pride
[1:30:52] praise god anyway
[1:30:56] joel did you have a message tonight
[1:31:01] what's stopping up the water
[1:31:05] the internet
[1:31:07] i tell you what i sometimes i'll catch
[1:31:08] myself i don't have my phone up here
[1:31:10] with me there's a reason for that it

[1:32:06] the blessings of god the way you should
[1:32:08] you're not gonna be able to carry it in
[1:32:09] those ditches if they're full of
[1:32:11] unforgiveness
[1:32:14] i'm inviting you tonight to dig that out
[1:32:18] sometime between now and the meeting
[1:32:20] sometime between now and the next
[1:32:22] service let's say
[1:32:24] get down to business with god
[1:32:26] whether it's tonight at the altar or
[1:32:28] tomorrow when you go to work you get
[1:32:30] down to business with god and you begin
[1:32:31] to say lord whatever is keeping the
[1:32:34] water from moving like it should
[1:32:37] let me get rid of it
[1:32:39] let me be willing to do the hard work of
[1:32:42] digging
[1:32:44] so that i can feel your presence again
[1:32:47] so that i can walk where you want me to
[1:32:49] walk
[1:32:51] so i don't have to sit in church and
[1:32:53] wonder if it's true or not
[1:32:56] let me feel the unction of the holy
[1:32:58] spirit again
[1:33:00] let me know what it is to have his
[1:33:02] presence within me moving and leading
[1:33:04] and guiding in my life
[1:33:08] lord i'm willing to dig
[1:33:11] is that your desire tonight to set your
[1:33:12] prayer
[1:33:13] i'm willing to do what it takes
[1:33:16] to have a ditch
[1:33:18] let them call me what they want to an
[1:33:20] old ditch digger that's okay
[1:33:22] i'll be an old-time christian
[1:33:25] that still believes in praying
[1:33:27] still believes in working
[1:33:29] not because i have to
[1:33:32] not because i could work my way to
[1:33:33] salvation
[1:33:35] but because
[1:33:36] he did so much for me
[1:33:39] and i want the presence of that rock
[1:33:42] that rock bought my freedom
[1:33:45] that rock gave me water it produced
[1:33:48] something in my life that began to life
[1:33:51] begin to come out and everything that i
[1:33:53] am i owe to the rock
[1:33:56] and if the ditches started to get
[1:33:57] stopped up let me dig it out
[1:33:59] let me do the hard work
[1:34:02] and i can't do it for you it's your
[1:34:04] pastor i wish i could you got to do the

[1:34:18] all just run over the top
[1:34:22] people run and jump and shout and scream
[1:34:24] and that's wonderful but it won't just
[1:34:25] all just run over the top it's like that
[1:34:27] hill our lives are like that hill it'll
[1:34:28] all just run off

[1:35:33] of the thing and i wasn't necessarily
[1:35:34] praying for you although i usually do
[1:35:37] when i come out here in the auditorium i
[1:35:39] come out here and pray for you but

[1:48:24] i gotta get off of here
[1:48:26] i told
[1:48:28] i saw a story the other day
[1:48:31] of a woman
[1:48:32] a young lady maybe this young lady's age
[1:48:35] went to a concert of country music star
[1:48:38] at a bar
[1:48:40] and she went there and she she got so
[1:48:43] uh so tired because she'd been up
[1:48:46] dancing all night
[1:48:48] for that star
[1:48:50] she'd been up in that bar dancing and
[1:48:52] drinking all night she got so tired she
[1:48:53] passed out
[1:48:54] asleep next to the bathrooms
[1:48:58] and she's laying there asleep and the
[1:49:00] man the the country music guy he comes
[1:49:02] up to her and just kind of scares her
[1:49:05] wakes her up and walks away
[1:49:07] and it made the news it went viral
[1:49:10] because she'd been touched
[1:49:12] by the star and she waited all night
[1:49:15] until she was so tired that she fell
[1:49:17] asleep
[1:49:20] she had an expectation
[1:49:23] of what that concert would bring
[1:49:25] i wonder if we'd come to church like
[1:49:26] that
[1:49:28] sure
[1:49:30] brother banner said this holy ghost had
[1:49:31] the same effect that wine does on the
[1:49:33] natural man
[1:49:35] we get so under expectation that we come
[1:49:38] to church
[1:49:39] and if we have to stay there till we
[1:49:41] pass out
[1:49:43] i'm not going to do that to you tonight
[1:49:44] but if we had to
[1:49:46] oh my
[1:49:48] we'd be willing to lay there until he
[1:49:50] comes by
[1:49:52] amen just one touch
[1:49:55] make it worth it
[1:49:57] oh aren't you glad for him tonight
