[14:57] somay am Amen brother Danny wanted to
[15:00] come and and give his testimony this
[15:01] morning of what God's done for him soen
[15:05] brother
[15:19] Danny first first off the first thing I
[15:22] want to say is I certainly do appreciate
[15:26] the church here and uh
[15:30] everyone that prayed for me while I went
[15:32] through this thing that I went through
[15:33] and
[15:35] uh it's been a little little crack and a
[15:40] and a blessing but I've learned a lot of
[15:42] things but uh it's all started back in
[15:46] December of last year with went for a a
[15:50] wellness check that Medicare wants you
[15:52] to do and I really didn't have no
[15:56] problems that I knew of I just we went
[15:58] to it because they told us we had to
[16:01] both to and so we did that and uh found
[16:06] out that when they run the blood test
[16:08] came back to PSA score which is a they
[16:12] judge your prostate health by that was a
[16:21] 18.26% a
[16:23] 4.00
[16:25] so they sent us to a to a a
[16:30] urologist on J in January which he
[16:33] started the test first thing you went
[16:36] for there for an exam he set us up for a
[16:39] they decided I needed a biopsy so they
[16:42] determined from that in
[16:45] March that I needed a that I had
[16:48] prostate cancer so they went to checking
[16:50] that and I don't know if you know
[16:52] anything about the gleon score and all
[16:54] that stuff mine was a nine and it you're
[16:57] supposed to be down around around three
[16:59] or four or something the higher that
[17:01] number the worse it is
[17:04] so all in all the then they sent me for
[17:07] a pet scan and they run me through
[17:11] several different things of biopsy and a
[17:13] pet scan finally we come down
[17:16] in in uh May the end of May that they
[17:21] sent us over to
[17:23] uh they had to go in and put some
[17:26] blockers in the prostate and then they
[17:28] started radiation treatment in June I
[17:30] went through 28 of them we finished that
[17:32] up July the
[17:34] 15th and
[17:37] uh I had didn't really have any major
[17:41] issues God brought me through that I
[17:43] thought rather well they think you know
[17:46] they say that the radiation is not
[17:48] something that's painful and I have to
[17:51] say it's not it took you go in there and
[17:53] it took longer to get ready get in there
[17:56] and get ready than it did to go through
[17:57] the radiation but but the after effects
[18:00] are I found out are a little more
[18:02] serious than I was really expecting but
[18:05] God's helped us through that we've been
[18:07] able to do whatever we needed to do and
[18:11] uh I know it's only because of all of
[18:14] the prayers of the Saints people have
[18:17] been praying for me for a lot from a lot
[18:19] of places and I certainly do appreciate
[18:21] it and I believe God's been really good
[18:23] to me so the PSA score went from uh an
[18:28] 18 up to a 24 before they started the ra
[18:33] the radiation and the hormone blockers
[18:35] and stuff they did I went back to the
[18:39] doctor last week and the report came
[18:42] back my PSA scored down to
[18:46] 0.36 and
[18:49] uh the doctor told me that I'd have to
[18:51] take the hormone shots for for a while
[18:55] they usually say it takes maybe up to
[18:57] two years you have to take those shots
[18:59] ever so often but they gave me the six
[19:02] month the six-month shot so I have to go
[19:05] back to the doctor in six months so he
[19:08] said he was well pleased with the way
[19:11] everything came out they did a x-ray of
[19:14] my or a CT scan of my colon or my uh
[19:19] excuse me they did a CT scan of my lower
[19:22] stomach my kidneys and stuff and he said
[19:25] everything looked good with that I had a
[19:27] kidney that had a few little bit kidney
[19:29] stones in it but nothing to be concerned
[19:32] about at this time so I just appreciate
[19:35] like I said everyone I appreciate the
[19:37] way that God has has touched my body
[19:40] I've been able to do a lot of things and
[19:43] still yet I get tired a little bit in
[19:45] the afternoon but I'm almost 75 years
[19:47] old so I guess I blame that part of that
[19:50] problem on that
[19:52] so once again I want to say from the
[19:54] bottom of my heart I love you
[19:57] people I love everyone that that uh is
[20:01] at this church and all around I know
[20:04] different people different places that
[20:06] prayed and I just
[20:08] appreciate that it makes it good when
[20:10] you people tell you that they've been
[20:12] praying for you I know that where our
[20:14] health comes help comes from and I know
[20:17] if the his if his mercy and Grace wasn't
[20:21] on the doctor's hands they couldn't they
[20:23] can't do nothing there nothing they do
[20:25] is them it's through God's grace
[20:29] I won't take no more of your time this
[20:30] morning but I just want you to know that
[20:33] I love you and I appreciate your prayers
[20:34] and I ask you to continue to pray for me
[20:37] that the Lord would keep me and uh just

[32:35] we've come down to a part that is
[32:37] important but before we go on into it I
[32:40] want to uh speak to you about the
[32:43] revealing of the son of man and maybe
[32:45] that would be something that sounds just
[32:46] a little bit different or strange to uh
[32:49] some of us and uh you say well I've
[32:52] heard people say that Brothers talk
[32:55] about it but what is it and so we're
[32:57] going to go into that a little bit today
[32:58] and you just bear with me and try to pay
[33:01] attention and we'll uh go into that and
[33:04] kind of set up what we're going to say
[33:05] this evening in the service this evening
[33:08] so just just stay with us if you can and
[33:11] and I want to be in such a way that the
[33:13] Lord would help me that when you leave
[33:15] you would you would know what that is
[33:16] and and how it applies to your life so
[33:19] we want to talk about the revealing of
[33:21] the son of man and uh and uh brother
[33:24] Stewart and brother Joel are out this
[33:26] week but we're going to make up for it
[33:27] next next week they'll be here and I'm

[33:46] appreciate brother Wendell and and he's
[33:48] always a help to the church so remember
[33:50] that as well October
[33:52] 27th amen let's read the word Luke
[33:55] chapter 17 verse 26 as it was in the
[33:58] days of Noah so shall it be also in the
[34:00] days of the son of man they did eat they
[34:04] drank they married wives they were given
[34:06] in marriage until the day that Noah
[34:08] entered into the ark and the flood came
[34:11] and destroyed them all likewise also as
[34:14] it was in the days of lot they did eat
[34:16] they drank they bought they sold they
[34:18] planted they builded but the same day
[34:21] that lot went out of Sodom it rained
[34:22] fire and brimstone from heaven and
[34:25] destroyed them all it says even thus
[34:28] shall it be in the day when the son of
[34:31] man is revealed I pray the Lord would
[34:33] add his Blessing to the word you may be
[34:41] seated good to see each and everyone
[34:44] this morning look like we got a couple
[34:45] of visitors God bless you this morning
[34:46] good to good to have all of you with
[34:50] us what is the revealing of the son of
[34:53] man and why does it matter to me
[34:58] as an
[34:59] individual I you know everything when we
[35:02] come to church there ought to always be
[35:04] something that applies to us something
[35:07] we can take home something we can uh uh
[35:10] we can take to work something we can
[35:12] take to school I heard a story about a
[35:14] woman who went to the to church and she
[35:17] listened to the sermon and and when the
[35:19] pastor was done she said pastor that was
[35:21] a great sermon she said she said uh
[35:24] everything you said applies to someone I
[35:26] know
[35:28] but you know we can do that and look at
[35:30] how it applies to somebody else but how
[35:31] does it apply to me and how does it make
[35:34] a difference in my life and I want to
[35:36] tell you I want to present to you this
[35:38] morning that this message makes a
[35:40] difference in our lives it makes a
[35:42] difference we're not just talking about
[35:44] it we don't get up here just to talk
[35:46] about a man we don't get up here just
[35:48] for the purpose of uh of exalting a man
[35:51] or telling a story about a great faith
[35:53] healer somewhere something like that
[35:55] what we get up here for is is to preach
[35:58] the light of the hour the message of the
[36:00] hour because it changes us it it makes
[36:03] us better husbands and makes you better
[36:05] wives and makes you better church
[36:07] members and makes you better makes you
[36:09] able to live in a in a world that's gone
[36:11] crazy gives you a sane mind and and it's
[36:14] the message that does it he said well
[36:16] it's the Holy Ghost yes the message and
[36:18] the Holy Ghost are together the holy the
[36:20] angel always accompanies the message and
[36:23] so when we believe the message and
[36:25] preach the message and stand for the
[36:27] message of the hour the holy ghost
[36:29] anoints that in our lives and and
[36:31] produces a life that the world can see
[36:34] and and see that there's a difference in
[36:35] us and I want there to be a difference
[36:37] do you say well I don't want to be
[36:38] different I do want to be different
[36:41] because the world is going crazy the
[36:43] world is is full of nonsense and the
[36:45] world is fixing to go into tribulation I
[36:48] want to be different enough that when
[36:50] the moment comes and and it's time for
[36:53] the bride to go home that I go home with
[36:55] the bride I don't want to be with the
[36:57] Millions who will have to endure the
[36:59] tribulation period I want to go home I
[37:01] want to go in a Rapture and to do that
[37:03] I'm going to have to be different
[37:05] according to the word not different just
[37:07] to be different but to but to have the
[37:10] son of man revealed to me and through
[37:13] me now we want to know how this applies
[37:17] in our lives brother brandom tells us we
[37:19] can never enter the house of the Lord
[37:22] and go out the same we go better or
[37:25] worse how many came to church this
[37:27] morning
[37:30] full participation there right you came
[37:32] to
[37:32] church you walked through those doors
[37:35] unless you were teleported here maybe
[37:37] some of you children were asleep and you
[37:39] just showed up in church you know if
[37:41] you're a church kid you know what I'm
[37:43] talking about you just kind of show up
[37:45] on the Pew and you're there and uh I
[37:48] went to church like that sometimes as a
[37:50] kid you know you fall asleep on the way
[37:51] to church and they carry you in and wait
[37:53] I'm in church what am I doing
[37:55] here and and but you came this morning
[37:59] so you're going to go out later better
[38:03] or worse there's no in between God I
[38:06] want to be better let this service make
[38:09] a difference in my life I don't care who
[38:11] the preacher is I don't care who what's
[38:13] going on around me or what I've been
[38:15] through during the week let me be
[38:16] somebody who can take something home
[38:19] with me that's good because you'll
[38:20] either go out better or worse depending
[38:23] on our attitude towards the word now
[38:26] let's get into this this morning do you
[38:28] love the word this morning let's get
[38:30] into this Luke 17: 30 says even thus
[38:34] shall it be in the day when the son of
[38:37] man is revealed even thus shall it be in
[38:41] the day when the son of man is revealed
[38:43] that word revealed means to to cause
[38:46] something to be fully known
[38:49] disclosed or revealed and we know there
[38:52] will come a day when Christ comes on the
[38:54] Mount of Olives where every eye will see
[38:57] him and it'll be no secret that he's
[39:01] here at the end of the tribulation
[39:04] period we'll actually come back with him
[39:07] and at that time it'll be no
[39:10] secret that he's in in on the Earth
[39:13] right he's going to rule and reign with
[39:15] a rod of iron the Bible says behold he
[39:16] cometh with clouds and every eye shall
[39:19] see him and they also which pierced him
[39:22] and all kindreds of the Earth shall
[39:24] whail because of him we know he's coming
[39:26] back in that way
[39:27] Zechariah 14:4 says his feet his feet
[39:31] brother JT I believe that's a literal
[39:33] thing I believe God's literally going to
[39:35] do this his feet shall stand in that day
[39:37] upon the Mount of Olives which is before
[39:40] Jerusalem on the East and the Mount of
[39:41] Olives shall cleave in the midst of them
[39:43] getting a little bit of rebound from
[39:45] these uh uh these speakers brother Gabe
[39:47] if you want to just bring them down just
[39:49] a little bit I think it's from the
[39:50] monitors it says and the Mount of olive
[39:53] shall cleave in the midst thereof
[39:55] towards the east and toward the west and
[39:57] there shall be a very great valley and
[39:59] half of the mountain sh moved toward the
[40:00] North and half of it toward the South
[40:02] that's really going to happen one of
[40:03] these days right that's really going to
[40:06] happen there's going to be a a reality
[40:08] to that we're going to see him uh
[40:10] there's going to be a physical coming of
[40:12] Christ Revelation 1911 and you can read
[40:14] the whole chapter maybe when you get
[40:16] home he said I saw heaven opened and
[40:18] behold a white horse and he that set
[40:20] upon him was called faithful and true
[40:22] that reveals something to us about his
[40:24] nature this morning he's faithful to us
[40:26] in the darkest Tri he's faithful to us
[40:28] down to the end of the age he's faithful
[40:31] all the way do you believe that this
[40:32] morning he's faithful in truth and in
[40:35] righteousness he does judge and make
[40:37] war but we realize then that the second
[40:40] coming of Christ that we're coming up to
[40:43] now the Rapture will not be like that at
[40:46] all it'll be a secret
[40:49] coming right a secret coming mark 13:32
[40:53] But of that day and that hour knoweth no
[40:56] man know not the the Angels which are in
[40:58] heaven neither the son but the father
[41:01] verse 33 take your heed watch and pray
[41:03] for you know not when the time is for
[41:06] the son of man is as a man taking a far
[41:08] Journey who left his house and gave
[41:10] authority to his servants and to every
[41:13] man his work and commanded the porter to
[41:15] watch watch ye therefore for you know
[41:17] not when the Master of the House cometh
[41:19] at even or at midnight or at the cockc
[41:21] or in the morning lest coming suddenly
[41:23] he finds you sleeping and what I say
[41:26] unto you he said I say to all
[41:30] watch now that word watch means I am
[41:34] awake in the night means I'm watchful on
[41:38] the
[41:38] alert and that ought to be the the
[41:41] attitude and the posture of every
[41:43] believer this morning I'm awake are you
[41:46] awake this morning and I'm not just
[41:49] talking naturally but spiritually are we
[41:52] awake uh can we know the times and the
[41:54] seasons do we know what hour we're
[41:56] living in or we let the world just kind
[41:58] of Dole it down to us and until we get
[42:00] to where we just kind of move along and
[42:02] do what we've always done but I think
[42:04] it's time to wake up and that's what the
[42:06] revealing of the son of man was to do
[42:08] was to wake us up now look he said but 1
[42:11] Thessalonians 5:1 but of the times and
[42:12] the seasons Brethren he said you have no
[42:15] need that I write unto you for
[42:17] yourselves know perfectly that the day
[42:18] of the Lord cometh as a thief in the
[42:20] night now that's not when he reveals
[42:22] himself to the world but when he comes
[42:25] as a thief in the night right and so he
[42:28] doesn't reveal himself in this coming to
[42:30] everybody he doesn't appear to everybody
[42:33] but he oh church do you realize how
[42:35] blessed you are if he's appeared to you
[42:37] you realize if you know about the
[42:39] message of the hour and and there's
[42:41] something in it that it just strikes
[42:42] your heart say I know that that's true I
[42:44] may you may not have had you might have
[42:46] come out of Darkness you might have come
[42:47] out of a hard family you might have come
[42:49] out of a bad situation but there's
[42:51] something in your heart when the light
[42:53] struck that seed there's something down
[42:55] in there that said I know that I'm a
[42:56] child of God I know that voice speaks to
[42:59] me just like Abraham standing there on
[43:01] the plane of memory and he heard the
[43:03] voice of that one and he said I've heard
[43:05] that voice before I know I'm predestined
[43:07] to believe
[43:08] it and somehow he brought you out of the
[43:11] darkness and brought oh chch I wish
[43:13] somebody preach with me this morning he
[43:15] brought you out of the darkness he
[43:16] brought you out of the mug he brought
[43:18] you out of the M what was it he was
[43:20] revealing himself to you pulling you up
[43:23] out of what you were and bringing you
[43:24] into the message of the hour you said
[43:26] brother Ben I can't understand every
[43:27] little thing about it neither can I but
[43:29] I know I was born to believe it this is
[43:32] who I am I can't deny it to deny it
[43:34] would be to deny who I
[43:41] am
[43:43] Hallelujah I told the church at wles
[43:46] last
[43:47] week preaching over there I I told them
[43:49] I said I don't pause for dramatic effect
[43:51] I pause because I'm fat
[43:58] and it's just you have to catch your
[44:00] breath but I get so excited when I hear
[44:04] when I think about what he's done for us
[44:07] and many times we there's a sermon I was
[44:11] listening to this morning and I don't
[44:12] want to repr preach it because sometimes
[44:13] you listen to things and I was listening
[44:15] to brother bisco brother had bisc preach
[44:17] a sermon called the value of the flaw if
[44:18] you've ever if you need to go back and
[44:21] listen to that if you get a chance on
[44:22] YouTube you can look it up and and of
[44:25] course brother Bisal is older now and
[44:27] able to preach but but you know I I
[44:29] thank God that he allowed him to preach
[44:31] that sermon because he took the message
[44:32] and and showed us that you know we can
[44:35] it depends what our attitude is toward
[44:37] the flaws in our life and what we do
[44:40] with that and so God when he saw the
[44:43] flaw he saw
[44:45] opportunity right he saw opportunity and
[44:48] many times we see the flaw and we see
[44:50] all we see well I'm always going to be
[44:52] this way I'm always this is what I come
[44:54] out of so this is the way I'm always
[44:55] going to be but you're not destined to
[44:57] reproduce that there's something that
[44:59] God wants to do in your life and if God
[45:01] allowed the flaw he did that to gain
[45:03] something from you to to to bring
[45:05] something out of your life and you got
[45:07] to believe that all things work together
[45:09] for the good to them that love God to
[45:11] the called according to his purpose when
[45:13] he saw the flaw when he smoke Jesus on
[45:15] the cross what was he
[45:17] doing oh church he was he was using the
[45:20] flaw to become the Masterpiece
[45:25] right now look
[45:27] you say well I don't I don't understand
[45:30] these things but you know the Lord's
[45:32] coming and how do you know that well we
[45:35] know not that just that he's coming but
[45:36] that he's here in his word he's the same
[45:39] yesterday today and forever look he said
[45:42] they'll say peace and safety when they
[45:45] shall say peace and safety then sudden
[45:48] destruction cometh upon them now the
[45:50] second coming and and you know your
[45:54] theology may be different about this but
[45:56] I don't look for a for a a depression or
[45:59] a time of hardship that stuff's coming
[46:02] but at the time of the Rapture I think
[46:04] it'll probably be better than it ever
[46:06] was just based on the
[46:09] scripture right things will just
[46:11] probably be
[46:13] swimmingly right and everything politics
[46:15] Will seem like they oh they got it under
[46:17] control and everything's everybody loves
[46:21] everybody right because that's what the
[46:22] Bible says when they shall say peace and
[46:25] safety then
[46:27] sudden destruction cometh upon them as
[46:30] travail and you can disagree with me on
[46:32] that that's fine I know there'll be we
[46:34] may see a pre-tribulation some things
[46:37] begin to happen as the tribulation nears
[46:39] but we don't go through the
[46:41] tribulation right we we're going in a
[46:44] Rapture but we know it's in an hour that
[46:46] you think not in an hour that'll catch
[46:47] you unawares in an hour that the world's
[46:50] not not looking for something to happen
[46:52] because they say peace and safety that's
[46:54] right and sudden destruction cometh upon
[46:56] them as travail upon a woman with child
[46:58] and they shall not Escape but ye
[47:00] Brethren oh my are not in darkness that
[47:03] that day should overtake you as a thief
[47:05] you are all the children of light and
[47:08] the children of the day amen we are not
[47:11] of the night nor of the darkness oh my I
[47:14] said therefore let us not sleep as do
[47:16] others but let us watch and be sober
[47:18] listen in a time when the conditions of
[47:20] the Earth are the same as they were in
[47:22] the days of Noah and lot the son of man
[47:24] would be revealed or made known what was
[47:26] it it's something he he wants to unveil
[47:29] himself and that word reveal then is to
[47:32] if you think about it like this it's
[47:34] literally like there would be a statue
[47:37] and a sculpture has made this
[47:39] statue and and he has uh every little
[47:43] intricate detail if You' seen a great
[47:45] sculpture how every little intricate
[47:48] detail has been
[47:50] carved and then he covers it because he
[47:53] doesn't want it to be seen until the
[47:56] appointed
[47:57] time right because the right people have
[48:00] to be there to witness it he's already
[48:03] seen it he already knows the finished
[48:06] product but he covers it until the
[48:09] appointed hour that they have the
[48:12] unveiling and so they gather everybody
[48:14] together all the critics and all the
[48:16] people that would come in and want to
[48:18] see this wonderful all the fans of this
[48:20] particular sculpture they would they
[48:22] would Gather in and and they would they
[48:25] would watch for the unveiling then he
[48:27] would take the the cloth or whatever was
[48:29] covering the object the uh the sculpture
[48:32] that was standing there and rip it
[48:34] off and when he pulled it off suddenly
[48:37] you can see before what you guessed at
[48:41] yeah now you can see clearly before it
[48:44] was pulled off you might say well that's
[48:46] a that's a that's a statue of Mickey
[48:53] Mouse before it pulled off you might say
[48:57] that was the Statue of Donald Duck I'm
[49:00] getting good response from that
[49:04] so someone might look out there and say
[49:06] that looks like Mickey Mouse that looks
[49:08] like it's got ears on it you know that
[49:10] looks like Donald Duck and that looks
[49:12] like this one or that one before it's
[49:15] unveiled you You Don't See Clearly what
[49:17] it is you can't see the detail of what
[49:21] it is but when it's pulled off then you
[49:25] can see the detail yeah oh my so that's
[49:29] what God was doing in this hour in the
[49:31] hour when the son of man would be
[49:32] revealed who is the son of man is Christ
[49:34] and we'll get into that but the son of
[49:36] man had to be revealed in this day so
[49:39] that we would know the detail of who God
[49:42] is so we could prepare ourselves so we
[49:44] could become that word and we could
[49:48] actually manifest that word around us
[49:50] listen this message is not just hearing
[49:52] this message is doing amen it's not
[49:55] about going to church and paying your
[49:57] ties though I'm I'm grateful that you do
[49:59] I'm glad you go to church I'm glad you
[50:00] pay your ties but that's not what the
[50:02] message came to do the message came for
[50:05] a reason and the message came so that
[50:07] you and I could become that
[50:10] word and peace becomes a reality Joy
[50:13] becomes a reality Faith becomes a
[50:16] reality the Rapture becomes a reality
[50:19] healing becomes a reality what is it
[50:21] it's God manifesting
[50:24] himself oh there's a big difference in
[50:26] the head
[50:28] knowledge and the reality of it
[50:31] expressing it listen in an hour
[50:36] denominational darkness of dogmas and
[50:38] Creeds had veiled him obscured him who
[50:42] is the word so much so we did not even
[50:46] know what to look
[50:48] for right whe whether there would be a
[50:51] Rapture the son of man is revealed to
[50:54] show us Hebrews 138 Jesus Jesus Christ
[50:58] the same yesterday today and forever the
[51:03] son of man is revealed for the purpose
[51:06] of expressing Christ the same yesterday
[51:09] today in Fe brother R said what is the
[51:11] son of man been revealed Jesus Christ
[51:14] the same yesterday today and
[51:18] forever now watch in in in the Book of
[51:21] Ezekiel if you go back and again I don't
[51:22] have time this morning to go all into it
[51:25] but Ezekiel uh in Ezekiel God calls his
[51:28] Prophet a son of man he calls him this
[51:31] he said unto me son of man stand upon
[51:33] thy feet and I will speak unto thee and
[51:34] they would have understood that it's
[51:36] very difficult to translate into English
[51:38] but they would have understood that is
[51:40] here is a vessel that God can use here's
[51:42] a flesh son of man den not that it's a
[51:45] it's a man but he's somebody that God's
[51:48] going to use to speak through so God's
[51:51] going to use this body of Flesh and this
[51:53] son of man would be a a prophet this is
[51:56] a son of man a prophet he comes to as a
[52:00] prophet to Abraham but he comes in just
[52:01] a created body right he comes as someone
[52:05] made the point the other night and I it
[52:07] just thrilled my heart you know when he
[52:09] come to Abraham he had to create a body
[52:11] but when he come in our age he didn't
[52:12] have to create a body why Calvary
[52:16] worked right and the blood of Jesus
[52:18] Christ so
[52:21] cleansed a man who was born in sin
[52:23] shaping in iniquity that he could come
[52:25] down in a body of of a
[52:27] prophet right but he didn't just want to
[52:29] stop with the body of a prophet getting
[52:31] ahead of myself but he wants to come
[52:32] down in your body and my body that's the
[52:36] revealing of the son of man but he come
[52:39] as a prophet in a body to Abraham and so
[52:41] we'll get more maybe into that tonight
[52:43] and I'm going to try to preach to you
[52:45] tonight not just teach it but I'm going
[52:47] to try to preach it to you in such a way
[52:48] that we can see it in Abraham now Daniel
[52:51] tells us of the son of man who will
[52:53] reign Daniel 7:13 he said I saw in the
[52:55] night visions behold one like the son of
[52:57] man who came with the Clouds Of Heaven
[52:59] came to the Ancient of Days they brought
[53:01] him near before him there was given him
[53:03] dominion and glory and a kingdom now
[53:05] this man's more than a prophet right
[53:07] this son of man is more than just a an
[53:09] Earthly man this is the son of man from
[53:12] Heaven this is the son of man that that
[53:15] that that God created for this purpose
[53:17] so he's giving him Dominion glory and
[53:18] Kingdom that all people Nations and
[53:20] languages should serve him his Dominion
[53:22] is an everlasting Dominion which shall
[53:24] not pass away his kingdom that which
[53:26] shall will not be
[53:27] destroyed so when Jesus
[53:30] comes and identifies himself as the son
[53:33] of man to the generation he was speaking
[53:35] to they would have been very familiar
[53:37] with the Book of Daniel and know what he
[53:39] was saying if anybody ever tells you
[53:42] that Jesus never calls himself God they
[53:43] don't know what they're talking about
[53:46] yeah right because he identifies himself
[53:49] as the son of man that was his ministry
[53:52] on the earth son of man and then during
[53:55] the church ages he revealed himself Son
[53:56] of God and then during the Millennium
[53:58] he'll be son of
[54:00] David right but he before the Millennium
[54:03] he comes back at the end time that's
[54:05] what Luke 17:30 means that the son of
[54:08] man will be revealed at the end time
[54:10] like he
[54:12] was oh Church like he was in that age
[54:16] think about it Church blessed are your
[54:18] eyes that have seen blessed are your
[54:21] ears that have heard because God came
[54:24] down in your generation yeah and 2,000
[54:27] years ago he come in a body of flesh
[54:28] called Jesus that was for that purpose
[54:30] of redemption and he come down to redeem
[54:33] us but in this hour he comes down in a
[54:35] redeemed bride
[54:38] body oh
[54:41] church this is more than religion right
[54:44] I think it's time we quit playing
[54:46] church we quit just coming Church to go
[54:49] to church and we quit just going with no
[54:52] passion and no and no foresight and no
[54:55] no looking to see what uh what would
[54:57] might happen no expectation but we just
[54:59] come and say well I just come to church
[55:01] because it's my duty to come to church
[55:02] and I think my family be better if I
[55:04] come to church no we need to come with
[55:05] an expectation God you are revealing
[55:08] yourself in my day look what he did for
[55:10] us he did not just leave us here in
[55:12] stories from 2,000 years ago but he
[55:15] actually come down in our generation and
[55:17] revealed
[55:20] himself you said that don't make a
[55:22] difference to my life it made a
[55:23] difference to those he revealed himself
[55:25] to in his first coming
[55:27] it made a difference to the woman at the
[55:28] well when he revealed himself to her it
[55:31] made a difference to Peter when he
[55:32] revealed himself to him it made a
[55:34] difference to
[55:36] Nathaniel are you with me
[55:41] now I don't know this is strong but it's
[55:45] the
[55:46] truth it's the truth if we can believe
[55:49] it Jesus identified himself as the son
[55:51] of man they would have known he was
[55:53] talking about the one in Daniel
[55:57] look Jesus came into the coast of
[55:59] cesaria Philippi asked his disciples
[56:01] saying whom do men say that I the son of
[56:04] man
[56:06] am and they said some say that thou art
[56:09] John the Baptist so they identified him
[56:11] as a
[56:12] prophet some
[56:14] Elias others jeremias or one of the
[56:17] prophets it's interesting that some
[56:19] would say he was John the Baptist
[56:21] because you had a return Ministry in
[56:22] that
[56:23] day that Doctrine existed in that day
[56:27] because they wanted John the Baptist
[56:28] come it existed in Elijah's day too
[56:31] remember the school of the prophets went
[56:32] looking for
[56:33] Elijah right Elisha finally had to tell
[56:35] him you're not going to find him right
[56:38] well they went looking for his body and
[56:40] they were looking for uh John the
[56:42] Baptist because John the Baptist got his
[56:43] head cut off they said maybe you're John
[56:45] the Baptist
[56:46] reincarnated and some said Elias and
[56:49] others Jeremiah or one of the prophets
[56:51] but he saith unto them but whom say ye
[56:54] that I am and Simon Peter answered and
[56:57] said Thou Art the
[57:00] Christ are you with me this morning it's
[57:02] really important Thou Art the Christ the
[57:06] son of the Living God you are not just a
[57:09] son of man yeah you are the son of
[57:13] man and Jesus answered and said unto him
[57:16] blessed art thou Simon bar Jonah for
[57:18] Flesh and Blood ha not revealed it unto
[57:20] thee but my Father which is in heaven
[57:22] what was he saying the son of man is God
[57:24] in flesh
[57:26] just like Abraham saw him and knew who
[57:28] he was Peter saw him and knew he was God
[57:31] and we know in this hour the son this
[57:32] son of man Christ would be revealed when
[57:35] the world is in a Sodom condition that's
[57:37] Luke 17:30 we believe that brother
[57:40] brandom's Ministry fulfilled Luke 17:30
[57:43] that that was at least he fulfilled the
[57:46] part of a prophet of a son of man
[57:48] Prophet would come a body that God would
[57:50] use the son of man was revealed in his
[57:52] ministry but he was not the son of man
[57:54] he was a son of man revealing the son of
[57:57] man just like your flesh is not God my
[58:00] flesh is not God but we reveal God by
[58:03] our
[58:04] actions right so brother brandham was
[58:06] not the son of man he said he answered
[58:08] the question some say brother brandham
[58:09] is the son of man they said I thought
[58:11] the pillar of fire was a son of man am I
[58:13] mistaken they were wrong on both
[58:16] counts right remember that's what Peter
[58:18] said Jesus said who do men say that I
[58:20] the son of man am he knew he was the son
[58:22] of man but he had to realize he was the
[58:24] Christ yeah the anointed word are you
[58:28] with me now and so now he said some say
[58:32] brother Brandon was the son of man some
[58:33] thought the pillar of fire he said
[58:34] that's a good question very good but I
[58:36] am not the son of man but a son of man
[58:39] there's quite a difference Jesus Christ
[58:42] was the son of man amen the Son of God
[58:44] the son of man the son of day that's why
[58:46] we don't believe that the message died
[58:48] when brother brandom died that's why we
[58:50] don't believe it's buried in a grave in
[58:51] Jeffersonville but we believe that Jesus
[58:54] Christ is the same yesterday to day and
[58:56] forever he just showed us he showed us
[58:59] what the reality of God's presence would
[59:02] be
[59:09] like that doesn't make a difference it
[59:11] made a difference to
[59:13] them who were touched by
[59:16] it this son of man revealing himself
[59:18] made a difference in my
[59:21] life because I shouldn't be a message
[59:24] believer I I shouldn't be based on what
[59:27] I went through and what and our
[59:28] upbringing my mother shouldn't be
[59:29] sitting here this morning my brother
[59:31] Joel's not here this morning he
[59:32] shouldn't be a preacher today we
[59:34] shouldn't be have anything to do with
[59:36] the message cuz some of the things we've
[59:37] seen I know some of you could Testify
[59:39] the same but the revealing of the son of
[59:41] man in our generation made a difference
[59:44] in our family it made a difference it's
[59:47] not because my family's a bunch of uh
[59:49] you know people that can't get along
[59:50] with people and you wonder why you know
[59:53] I've always tried to be uh be try to be
[59:55] kind to people I do my best to do that
[59:57] church I know sometimes it don't come
[59:59] across that way but I do my best to be
[1:00:01] kind and reach out and and go to these
[1:00:03] meetings and be a help to as many people
[1:00:05] as I can my family is not naturally that
[1:00:08] way we we don't just do that I'm talking
[1:00:10] about my father's family and and and and
[1:00:12] our background they're they're very
[1:00:14] quiet people and they stay to themselves
[1:00:16] and they hold grudges against people but
[1:00:18] I I've been touched by the revealing of
[1:00:21] the son of man in my generation so that
[1:00:23] it's changed my outlook on life and the
[1:00:25] the Holy Ghost in me wants to reach out
[1:00:27] even when I don't want to even when I
[1:00:30] think I I just withdraw and start
[1:00:32] holding grudges and bitterness there's
[1:00:34] something inside of me won't let me why
[1:00:36] this revealing of the son of man made a
[1:00:38] difference in my
[1:00:43] life it'll make a difference in yours if
[1:00:45] you let
[1:00:51] it he come in three sons name he said
[1:00:54] that's a good question very good but I'm
[1:00:55] not the son of man but a son of man
[1:00:57] quite a difference Jesus Christ was the
[1:00:59] son of man Son of God Son of Man son of
[1:01:02] David brother brandom even talked about
[1:01:05] how reluctant he was to even call
[1:01:06] himself a prophet he said I don't want
[1:01:09] to call myself anything but your
[1:01:11] brother I am your brother and you just
[1:01:13] regard me as brother Bill or brother
[1:01:15] brandom or whatever you want to do about
[1:01:19] that he said now that he explains that
[1:01:22] the pillar of fire is the anointing
[1:01:24] right the shakina
[1:01:26] uh he said that Pillar of Fire is the
[1:01:28] logos that went out of God logos which
[1:01:31] is actually the attribute of the
[1:01:32] fullness of God now how many know what
[1:01:34] the logos is the
[1:01:37] word right the word it's God in material
[1:01:41] form God's thought
[1:01:43] expressed was Christ the word yeah right
[1:01:47] and and I shouldn't be too deep for us
[1:01:49] we should be able to to grasp that and
[1:01:52] so if you have trouble with that brother
[1:01:54] Brown visualizes like a little light
[1:01:57] spinning out of that great Eternal one
[1:01:59] and it's just a part of God but it's the
[1:02:02] attribute it's not just an attribute
[1:02:03] like we're an attribute but it's the
[1:02:04] attribute of the fullness of God the
[1:02:07] attribute of the fullness of God he said
[1:02:09] when man was made in the image of God
[1:02:10] God came down in the image of man to
[1:02:12] redeem man that brought man and God
[1:02:14] together heavens and earth hugged and
[1:02:16] kissed each other I love this language
[1:02:18] God and man embraced each other as
[1:02:20] fatherhood and sunship when the logos
[1:02:22] became flesh and dwelt Among Us so the
[1:02:26] son of man was Jesus the anointing if we
[1:02:29] could say it that way or or the spirit
[1:02:31] the anointing the the pillar of fire was
[1:02:34] Christ which the the pillar of fire is
[1:02:38] just the anointing in a visible
[1:02:40] form now now just hang with me for a
[1:02:43] moment he said now this logos that was
[1:02:45] in him which was the spirit of God the
[1:02:46] anointing through the sanctifying grace
[1:02:47] of the blood brought many sons to God
[1:02:50] which is Anointed with what with this
[1:02:53] same
[1:02:54] logos I think I put put a picture that
[1:02:56] Pillar of Fire uh in in in there so
[1:02:59] what's happening is a son of man
[1:03:02] standing in the Pulpit like Ezekiel or
[1:03:05] any of the other prophets would stand
[1:03:06] there and proclaim the word of God but
[1:03:08] the the the the Striking thing about the
[1:03:11] picture is not the man but it's what's
[1:03:13] above the
[1:03:15] man right it's not the man so many
[1:03:18] people get but they did it in Jesus day
[1:03:21] they get to looking at the man brother
[1:03:23] said not to do that but he said look
[1:03:25] look at gu God did you look at the
[1:03:27] pillar of fire and and think about it
[1:03:29] think he let that be seen in our day
[1:03:32] that's a big deal you said God don't
[1:03:34] care about me he cares a whole lot about
[1:03:37] you he cares enough about you to let
[1:03:39] himself be seen he didn't have to do
[1:03:43] that right listen he come down when he
[1:03:45] come down in a body of Flesh and he come
[1:03:47] down and he went by and he showed
[1:03:49] himself to In Miracles and signs he
[1:03:51] didn't have to do that he could have
[1:03:53] just come down and died on the cross but
[1:03:55] he did it to show who he was he did it
[1:03:58] to give you Faith to believe who he was
[1:04:01] because something was about to happen
[1:04:02] there was going to be a change the Holy
[1:04:04] Ghost was going to come there going to
[1:04:05] be a change from the from the Jewish age
[1:04:08] to the Gentile dispensation to an age of
[1:04:10] mercy and Grace and so a Grace
[1:04:12] dispensation was coming and before this
[1:04:14] change he comes down again oh church he
[1:04:18] comes down and shows himself to us again
[1:04:20] you realize that that Pillar of Fire had
[1:04:22] not been seen with God's Prophet since
[1:04:24] the days of Paul yeah and before that it
[1:04:27] was Moses that he was with what was it
[1:04:30] the same God that was with Moses the
[1:04:31] same God that was with Paul it's the
[1:04:33] same God with us
[1:04:40] today I know the devil doesn't like that
[1:04:42] but it's the
[1:04:43] truth now again we don't idolize that
[1:04:46] man I I don't have to have a picture of
[1:04:49] it I've seen
[1:04:51] it right but I'll say this if you've
[1:04:53] never seen it you probably need to get a
[1:04:55] coin of with
[1:04:56] it I'm glad it
[1:04:59] exists look when Jesus died you can move
[1:05:03] on to the next scripture Acts 2 and
[1:05:05] three when Jesus died the fullness of
[1:05:07] God which dwelt in his body divided into
[1:05:10] each member of the church so God the the
[1:05:13] logos came down and split himself up and
[1:05:17] he's not any less than what he was no
[1:05:20] more than if you took a spoonful of
[1:05:22] ocean it' still be the ocean I think can
[1:05:25] still have all the the attributes in it
[1:05:27] of the ocean but it would just be a
[1:05:30] portion right and and what God put in
[1:05:32] you is God it's deity but it's not all
[1:05:35] of God because he's in me he's in Peter
[1:05:37] he's in Sister Lor he's in all of us
[1:05:40] right that are believers so so he he
[1:05:42] divided himself and sat down on the
[1:05:44] congregation the 120 that were there so
[1:05:47] he divided himself and then from then on
[1:05:49] every time a person received the true
[1:05:51] baptism of the Holy Ghost what did they
[1:05:52] receive a portion of the logos right a
[1:05:56] portion of the logos brother Brown said
[1:05:58] do you get it God the logos separating
[1:06:00] himself into man help me preach this
[1:06:02] morning I know this is technical but
[1:06:04] we're going to we're going to get to
[1:06:06] something in a minute he said God not in
[1:06:07] one person he's in his church
[1:06:10] Universal right now he said while God is
[1:06:13] here speaking with us in our hearts he's
[1:06:15] in Africa so he wasn't just talking
[1:06:18] about himself but he said he's in Africa
[1:06:21] he's in Asia he's in Europe he's in
[1:06:23] England wherever Believers are gathered
[1:06:25] together
[1:06:26] there he is in the midst of them don't
[1:06:28] tell me it has to be in one place or we
[1:06:30] all have to listen to a tape at the same
[1:06:32] time it's
[1:06:34] nonsense it's nonsense he's not in one
[1:06:37] person he divided himself into his
[1:06:39] church
[1:06:40] Universal amen he said I am not he I am
[1:06:43] his servant and the pillar of fire is
[1:06:45] not he it's in spirit form he said which
[1:06:47] was upon the son of man and has come now
[1:06:49] to anoint sons of man sons of man to
[1:06:53] bring back a Ministry just exactly like
[1:06:55] said it would be in order for the head
[1:06:57] and the rest of the body to connect
[1:06:59] together
[1:07:01] Hallelujah he was bottled up in one man
[1:07:04] Jesus Christ but not
[1:07:06] now but he is revealing himself in and
[1:07:09] through the
[1:07:11] bride as a part of that revealing of the
[1:07:15] son of man there had to be a Prophet
[1:07:17] come a son of man to reveal the son of
[1:07:20] man brother BR said he said that was the
[1:07:23] seventh Angel's message opening up
[1:07:26] the
[1:07:28] seals what is it not the angel is the
[1:07:30] son of man but the messenger is
[1:07:33] revealing the son of man I'm taking it
[1:07:36] slow so we get it this morning so he
[1:07:39] said can you get it separated now that's
[1:07:41] where it seems to be so hard for you he
[1:07:43] said not the son of man himself but the
[1:07:45] seventh angel the seventh messenger is
[1:07:47] revealing to the public the son of man
[1:07:50] because it's left to shuck he can't
[1:07:51] organize it it's the grain itself again
[1:07:55] and we speak of the logos maybe someone
[1:07:57] wouldn't know what that is that's from
[1:07:58] John 1 John 1 and one in the beginning
[1:08:01] was the
[1:08:02] logos that's what that word means the
[1:08:04] Greek word is logos the word and the
[1:08:07] Word was with God that doesn't mean this
[1:08:08] Bible existed in this form right with
[1:08:12] God that's not what that means but the
[1:08:14] logos became the
[1:08:16] Bible are you with me now he he he come
[1:08:20] down this is him in print form but this
[1:08:23] is him amen yeah I hope you hear me
[1:08:26] today and this is him are you with me
[1:08:29] now you are him in expression form in
[1:08:34] body form but in the beginning was the
[1:08:38] word and the Word was with God and the
[1:08:41] word someone say say it with me was God
[1:08:44] the Word was God the same was in the
[1:08:47] beginning with God all things were made
[1:08:50] by him without him was not anything made
[1:08:54] that was made and then if you go down to
[1:08:56] verse 14 he says and the Word was made
[1:09:00] flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld
[1:09:04] his glory the glory as of the only
[1:09:06] begotten of the father full of grace and
[1:09:09] truth and so if he is the son of man
[1:09:11] then the revealing of the son of man
[1:09:13] would be the revealing of the
[1:09:15] word right because it was the word that
[1:09:17] existed in the
[1:09:19] beginning amen he was revealed now
[1:09:22] remember he was revealed partially in
[1:09:24] reformers he was revealed partially
[1:09:26] through church ages but now the full
[1:09:28] word is to be reserved for a for a son
[1:09:31] of man to reveal the son of man said but
[1:09:34] at the opening of The Seven Seals
[1:09:36] Revelation 10 the full word is to be
[1:09:38] born into manifestation again I feel I
[1:09:40] feel like I'm not reaching some of you
[1:09:44] this Bible was
[1:09:47] sealed right what was sealed the
[1:09:49] understanding of
[1:09:50] it right and that's why go get a
[1:09:53] commentary and pick any verse
[1:09:56] and get five commentaries you'll have
[1:09:58] five different
[1:10:00] interpretations right because they're
[1:10:01] doing the best they can right it's not
[1:10:04] been
[1:10:05] unveiled that's why and I I you know I
[1:10:08] don't forgive me for this but we believe
[1:10:10] we I believe all of the message I
[1:10:11] believe that brother Brandon was a
[1:10:12] prophet no matter if it was 1950 or 1965
[1:10:15] but there were things that were not
[1:10:17] revealed to him yet until the opening of
[1:10:18] the
[1:10:20] word right because here here the book
[1:10:23] was closed
[1:10:26] it wasn't open and and John when he saw
[1:10:29] it in Revelation he said that book is
[1:10:31] closed the book of redemption without it
[1:10:33] being open everything's
[1:10:36] lost right and so they searched over
[1:10:38] Heaven they said they said let's find
[1:10:39] let's search over heaven and find
[1:10:41] somebody worthy and they looked over
[1:10:43] heaven and under Heaven they looked at
[1:10:44] those who had had lived who were living
[1:10:46] who would live and they said no one is
[1:10:49] worthy and Sean wept realizing the
[1:10:52] seriousness of it
[1:10:55] oh church but his weeping his his
[1:10:58] mourning was turned into dancing his
[1:11:00] weeping was turned into rejoicing why
[1:11:03] because the lamb who is the Lamb how
[1:11:06] many believe the lamb is Christ right he
[1:11:09] was the Lamb of God who takes away the
[1:11:11] that's what John said about him Behold
[1:11:13] the Lamb of God who takes away the sin
[1:11:15] of the
[1:11:16] world and so you kids can understand
[1:11:18] this the book was closed and the Lamb of
[1:11:20] God came who died for our sins and
[1:11:24] opened the
[1:11:28] book look that is the word being born
[1:11:33] into
[1:11:34] manifestation right but he didn't just
[1:11:36] open it in letter he didn't just give us
[1:11:39] a head knowledge of
[1:11:40] it church but he revealed himself
[1:11:44] through a
[1:11:46] body doing the same works that the that
[1:11:50] the body did in the first place the
[1:11:51] first time he came he revealed himself
[1:11:54] this time through a red redeemed body he
[1:11:56] revealed himself and he wants to reveal
[1:11:58] himself in us not in a partial way he
[1:12:01] revealed himself through Lutheran part
[1:12:03] he revealed himself through Us in part
[1:12:05] but he wants to reveal himself through
[1:12:06] Us in every part that's why God won't
[1:12:08] let you rest and you wonder why do I go
[1:12:10] through many struggles why do I have so
[1:12:12] many things happen in my life why is it
[1:12:13] that these things have to happen it's
[1:12:15] because of the revealing of the son of
[1:12:17] man he will not allow you to remain as a
[1:12:19] partially revealed word he will not
[1:12:21] allow you to remain as a deformed seed
[1:12:23] but he's going to bring you back he's
[1:12:25] going to redeem you he's going to make
[1:12:26] you ready for a
[1:12:29] Rapture how does he do that by the
[1:12:32] revealing of the son of
[1:12:34] man are you still with
[1:12:38] me he
[1:12:40] said in the last days he said it was man
[1:12:44] back up he said in the full strength as
[1:12:46] it was when he was here on Earth
[1:12:47] manifest in the same way he said doing
[1:12:50] the same things that it did when it was
[1:12:52] here on Earth he said amen Hebrews 138
[1:12:56] he keeps going back to that the
[1:12:57] revealing of the son of man Luke 17:30
[1:13:00] is Hebrews
[1:13:01] 138 are you with me now Jesus Christ is
[1:13:05] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:13:07] Jesus said in the last days as it was in
[1:13:09] the days of Sodom when the son of man
[1:13:10] will be revealing himself again it'll be
[1:13:12] the same thing he was a son of man
[1:13:14] Prophet revealing the son of man the
[1:13:17] word so the Rapture would not overtake
[1:13:19] us as a
[1:13:22] thief so Luke 21 Jesus told us when he
[1:13:24] was here Luke 2134 take heed to
[1:13:28] yourselves take heed you got a
[1:13:29] responsibility to the word lest at any
[1:13:33] time your hearts be
[1:13:37] overcharged with surfeiting surfeiting
[1:13:39] is being hung
[1:13:40] over that's what that word means having
[1:13:42] a headache from a
[1:13:44] hangover overcharged with a
[1:13:48] hangover a leoan hangover you say I
[1:13:50] don't drink brother Ben that's good
[1:13:55] what is it binging
[1:13:58] gorging
[1:14:01] life the cares of life that's what he
[1:14:03] says drunkenness surfeiting and cares of
[1:14:07] this life your heart gets dull
[1:14:12] heavy oh I hope I I hope I'm preaching
[1:14:15] to somebody this morning or once you it
[1:14:17] really thrilled you to hear about the
[1:14:19] things that God had done but your heart
[1:14:20] got dull cuz somebody said something
[1:14:23] they shouldn't have said somebody
[1:14:25] something they shouldn't have done and
[1:14:27] you just let it you kind of responded to
[1:14:29] that in a way well I'm just going to
[1:14:30] protect myself and so you got dull right
[1:14:33] oh I pray you'd wake up
[1:14:36] today you get dull you get
[1:14:41] overcharged because of something
[1:14:42] somebody said or something somebody done
[1:14:45] or too much
[1:14:48] Netflix right too much TV whatever form
[1:14:51] that takes today
[1:14:55] and you just feel yourself getting
[1:14:59] heavy and he's warning you he said he
[1:15:01] said I'm going to I'm going to reveal
[1:15:03] the son of
[1:15:04] man for the purpose that you won't do
[1:15:07] that you realize we're too late to hold
[1:15:11] grudges we're too late to sit there with
[1:15:14] our mind battle going on it's too late
[1:15:17] for
[1:15:18] that you'll find yourself overcharged
[1:15:21] with that with the cares of life and
[1:15:22] that day come on you unaware it's not
[1:15:24] because you never heard the message not
[1:15:26] because nobody ever preached it to you
[1:15:27] but you just gorged
[1:15:33] yourself I I'm preaching to myself
[1:15:37] today God help me there's so much you
[1:15:40] know how it is you go I'm just going to
[1:15:42] be honest with you I'm gonna be real
[1:15:43] with you you go to read your Bible and a
[1:15:47] hundred other things
[1:15:50] happen you go to look at the message on
[1:15:53] your phone CU that's mostly where I I
[1:15:55] study during the week and when I sit
[1:15:56] down I sit down with a computer and
[1:15:58] study from a computer but on my phone I
[1:16:00] I'll sit down and just look up quotes
[1:16:02] and look up scriptures and I just enjoy
[1:16:05] that and in fact one of the young people
[1:16:08] got me the other day he said you're
[1:16:09] talking about us being on our phones
[1:16:10] you're on your phone all the time
[1:16:13] they're not
[1:16:15] wrong but I like to do that but if
[1:16:17] you're not careful you know an email
[1:16:19] will come
[1:16:21] and that's why they tell you at work I
[1:16:23] don't know brother Allen if you've ever
[1:16:24] experienced this but there's an email
[1:16:25] problem at work or there used to be when
[1:16:27] you first got there if you just go over
[1:16:28] your emails try to answer them that's
[1:16:30] all you'll get done that day so they
[1:16:32] told us take an hour or two hours before
[1:16:34] you look at your email because you got
[1:16:36] to get some work done and then when you
[1:16:39] get your work done then look at your
[1:16:40] email why because you just get
[1:16:41] overburdened with putting out fires you
[1:16:43] can't get nothing done well I wonder
[1:16:46] church if we could take an hour or two
[1:16:47] in the morning before we looked at
[1:16:49] anything else if we just look at the
[1:16:51] word and say Lord keep me sharp keep me
[1:16:53] awake make sure that I'm ready I don't
[1:16:55] want to go with the tribulation I want
[1:16:57] to be your bride I believe I am your
[1:16:59] bride but Lord help me to be ready help
[1:17:01] me to be useful help me to get rid of
[1:17:03] all these all these things in my life
[1:17:05] all this listen church I'm telling you
[1:17:08] it's dangerous to sit there with with a
[1:17:10] grudge and bitterness and all those
[1:17:11] things it's a dangerous thing and it and
[1:17:13] it only hurts you why don't you just let
[1:17:16] go of it and let God begin to move in
[1:17:18] your life and let him be real to you
[1:17:20] again let the son of man be revealed
[1:17:22] again instead of holding on to things
[1:17:24] that happen a year ago or 10 years ago
[1:17:26] or 20 years
[1:17:28] ago he said but I forgive them then why
[1:17:32] do you still feel like that let it
[1:17:41] go that's what he says Watch and Pray
[1:17:44] always someone say always that you may
[1:17:47] be accounted worthy to escape all these
[1:17:50] things that shall come to pass and to
[1:17:52] stand before the son of man it'll be
[1:17:54] only by his grace will be able to do
[1:17:57] that is that
[1:17:58] right how will we escape this
[1:18:01] generation by the revealing of the son
[1:18:03] of man in his body you realize how hard
[1:18:07] it is how dark it
[1:18:08] is it's so dark that brother brandom had
[1:18:11] to take he said what he saw in the
[1:18:14] vision he saw the Holy Spirit blacked it
[1:18:16] out
[1:18:19] completely it's so
[1:18:21] dark that the darkness we don't even
[1:18:23] recognize that it's Darkness anymore you
[1:18:25] know how when you first go into the
[1:18:27] darkness at night it seems like
[1:18:28] everything oh it's so dark you can't see
[1:18:30] but if you stay in it long
[1:18:32] enough you feel like you can see but you
[1:18:35] can't see well enough not to
[1:18:37] fall listen to me Church the Bible says
[1:18:39] your feet are in Slippery
[1:18:41] places and without the light of the hour
[1:18:44] you can't see well enough not to fall
[1:18:47] then I'm not going to let something keep
[1:18:48] me out of the house of God I'm not going
[1:18:50] to let this world I'm not going to let a
[1:18:52] job I'm not going to let a I'm not going
[1:18:54] to let situation I'm not going to let a
[1:18:56] grudge I'm not going to let bitterness
[1:18:57] keep me from enjoying the presence of
[1:18:59] God and enjoying the word of God I'm
[1:19:01] going to live for God with all of my
[1:19:03] heart why because the son of man has
[1:19:05] been revealed it's too dangerous of an
[1:19:07] hour to be
[1:19:08] walking without any
[1:19:10] light that's
[1:19:13] right I want to ask you if the revealing
[1:19:15] of the son of man is the message of the
[1:19:16] hour what should our attitude towards
[1:19:18] the message
[1:19:20] be huh should be our daily bread
[1:19:24] yeah what's the message again it's this
[1:19:27] revealed how we should rever this
[1:19:32] word we should we should count it as
[1:19:37] life it's
[1:19:40] life after the miracle the loe's and the
[1:19:42] fishes you know them people might have
[1:19:44] starved out there they've been out there
[1:19:47] in the desert somebody might have died
[1:19:48] in a big crowd like that with no way to
[1:19:49] go to McDonald's or somewhere and get
[1:19:51] something to eat they might die if they
[1:19:52] went to McDonald's but anyway
[1:19:56] they're out there 5,000 of them out
[1:19:58] there all around the place and they got
[1:20:00] nowhere to go and Jesus provided from a
[1:20:03] little boy's lunch you remember the
[1:20:05] story he provided the Loaves and the
[1:20:08] fishes till they took up 12 baskets full
[1:20:11] of
[1:20:13] leftovers and when Jesus then left and
[1:20:16] across the sea they went looking for him
[1:20:20] in John chapter 6 he he he he recognizes
[1:20:24] that they're just there for the Lo's and
[1:20:26] the
[1:20:27] fishes right the
[1:20:29] potluck potlucks are okay because I got
[1:20:31] a revelation the other day Elohim
[1:20:34] invented the
[1:20:36] potluck the first time he ever come down
[1:20:38] on a body of Flesh he walked down and
[1:20:41] had a potluck with Abraham he said I
[1:20:43] don't know what we're going to have
[1:20:44] today but it's going to be good boys he
[1:20:47] created a body for the angel so they
[1:20:48] could come down with are you with me
[1:20:51] now so here they but they wanted just a
[1:20:54] loes and the fishes I want the Loaves
[1:20:56] and the fishes but I want him I trust
[1:20:58] that you do too he said you just want
[1:21:00] the Loaves and the fishes and John 6:27
[1:21:02] labor not for the meat which perisheth
[1:21:05] but for that meat which endureth unto
[1:21:07] everlasting life which the son of man
[1:21:09] shall give unto you for him hath God the
[1:21:12] Father sealed other words God given
[1:21:14] God's given him his authority and they
[1:21:16] immediately went back to Moses and said
[1:21:18] we Moses
[1:21:19] seed we're we're followers of Moses that
[1:21:21] our fathers did eat Mana in the desert
[1:21:23] as it is written he gave G them bread
[1:21:25] from Heaven to eat and then Jesus said
[1:21:27] to them verily verily I say unto thee
[1:21:29] you Moses gave you not that bread from
[1:21:31] Heaven that's a powerful
[1:21:34] statement Moses didn't give it to you
[1:21:36] God
[1:21:37] did right but my father giveth you the
[1:21:40] true bread from heaven for the bread of
[1:21:42] God is he which cometh down from heaven
[1:21:44] and giveth life unto the world they said
[1:21:46] un him Lord ever more give us this bread
[1:21:48] and Jesus said to them I am the bread of
[1:21:50] life he that cometh to me shall never
[1:21:52] hunger he that believeth on me shall
[1:21:55] never thirst you see a thirsting today
[1:21:58] it's not a lack of food but there's a
[1:22:00] lack today of meaning of
[1:22:03] purpose there's a lacking young people
[1:22:05] who are at the end of their wits and
[1:22:07] they're about to commit suicide and they
[1:22:08] think I'm just of no use to the world
[1:22:10] why they've never found the bread of
[1:22:12] life they've never found the Water of
[1:22:16] Life the devil tries to come and say
[1:22:18] you're nothing he might try to come to
[1:22:19] you young people and tell you're nothing
[1:22:20] and you're not worth anything and and
[1:22:22] you're you're too big or too little or
[1:22:24] nobody notices you don't you believe
[1:22:26] that lie of the devil you're part of
[1:22:28] God's economy he wouldn't have put you
[1:22:30] here in a message church and give you
[1:22:31] the parents that he did unless he loved
[1:22:33] you don't listen to that lie of the
[1:22:37] devil he cares about you he wants to be
[1:22:40] your
[1:22:42] bread he said I am that bread of
[1:22:46] life I am that bread of life he said I
[1:22:51] am the living bread verse 51 which came
[1:22:52] down from heaven If any man eat of this
[1:22:55] bread he shall live forever and the
[1:22:57] bread that I will give is my flesh which
[1:22:58] I will give for the life of the
[1:23:01] world and the Jews I'll I'll skip down
[1:23:03] to verse 54 the Jews begin to get begin
[1:23:06] to argue among themselves that how will
[1:23:07] this man give us his flesh to eat and
[1:23:09] his blood to drink and Jesus said unto
[1:23:12] them verily I said you except you eat
[1:23:13] the Flesh of the son of man and drink
[1:23:15] his blood you have no life in you but
[1:23:17] verse 54 who so eateth my flesh and
[1:23:19] drinketh my blood hath eternal life and
[1:23:21] I will raise him up at The Last Day
[1:23:23] verse 57 as the living father has sent
[1:23:25] me and I live by the father so he that
[1:23:28] eateth me even he shall live by me so
[1:23:31] the message of the hour is the son of
[1:23:33] man revealed then it's what we live by
[1:23:35] it's our daily bread it's what it's our
[1:23:37] whole
[1:23:38] existence that's why you might you might
[1:23:40] criticize me say but they been used to
[1:23:42] many quotes you you feel I'm not
[1:23:44] exalting a man I'm telling you this is
[1:23:46] the bread of
[1:23:52] life when I was in in
[1:23:56] Egypt I could you couldn't hardly eat
[1:23:58] the food brother Joel made the mistake
[1:24:00] cuz he was a rookie of eating the
[1:24:02] chicken and you don't eat anything
[1:24:05] hardly overseas maybe fish when you're
[1:24:07] in that kind of a country because it's
[1:24:09] very difficult for them to get food
[1:24:11] standards and safety and things the way
[1:24:12] we have it so they won't get sick but
[1:24:14] you
[1:24:15] will brother Joel got really sick and I
[1:24:18] didn't lose any weight on that trip
[1:24:21] despite sleeping with no air
[1:24:22] conditioning
[1:24:24] despite sleeping in a room that the door
[1:24:27] was a rooftop and I could have walked
[1:24:29] stepped out of my window onto the next
[1:24:30] door rooftop into the chicken pin and my
[1:24:33] window was
[1:24:36] open that's that's the way it
[1:24:39] was but I found I could eat the
[1:24:43] bread cuz bread is not so easily
[1:24:47] defiled church and they'd make bread
[1:24:50] they don't make bread like we do in a
[1:24:52] loaf they make bread in kind of like a
[1:24:53] pea it's like a
[1:24:54] like a round bread about this big kind
[1:24:58] of thick fluffy I loved
[1:25:01] it I probably wouldn't like it here but
[1:25:04] I loved it
[1:25:06] there cuz my heart wasn't overcharged
[1:25:09] with you
[1:25:10] know with eating too many McDonald's
[1:25:14] hamburgers right but what did he do what
[1:25:17] what did he do he or what happened I
[1:25:20] went and I ate the bread and it provided
[1:25:22] energy life
[1:25:25] and I was able to preach cuz I had
[1:25:27] something to eat oh Church Oh my he said
[1:25:31] as the living father has sent me and I
[1:25:33] live by the father so he that eateth me
[1:25:36] even he shall live by me what is he
[1:25:38] saying this gives you your energy this
[1:25:40] give you you know some people when they
[1:25:41] have a bad week they say well let's not
[1:25:43] go to church this week no that's the
[1:25:45] time to go to church that's the time to
[1:25:48] seek the Lord that's the time to get
[1:25:49] down on your knees why you live by the
[1:25:52] bread you live by the dealing of the son
[1:25:55] of
[1:25:59] man bread is the most important
[1:26:01] invention in human history I've got just
[1:26:03] a few more minutes we'll close by Jesus
[1:26:06] time it was considered to be a great
[1:26:07] achievement to be a baker in fact they
[1:26:09] had a Baker's Guild bread was absolutely
[1:26:12] essential to
[1:26:13] life Romans controlled the People by a
[1:26:16] policy that the poet juvenile I don't
[1:26:18] know if I'm saying his name right but
[1:26:20] but he called it bread and
[1:26:22] circuses it's food and entertainment
[1:26:25] it's how politicians control people
[1:26:28] today right you heard politicians talk
[1:26:30] about price fixing bread and
[1:26:33] circuses right they just want you to be
[1:26:36] fed so you won't vote against
[1:26:39] them France fell because Marie
[1:26:42] Antoinette may or may not have said let
[1:26:44] them eat
[1:26:45] cake but people believe she said it when
[1:26:49] the people had no bread Bill Clinton the
[1:26:52] famous
[1:26:53] philosopher said it this way it's the
[1:26:55] economy
[1:27:00] stupid what was it bread and
[1:27:02] circuses whoever gives you food and
[1:27:04] entertainment has your vote but I'm
[1:27:07] looking for I want to vote for something
[1:27:10] else and it's not wrong to vote I'm not
[1:27:12] saying that you vote and probably you
[1:27:13] should vote in this hour day we live in
[1:27:15] is so scary but I'll say this I'll say
[1:27:18] this that's not what I'm looking for for
[1:27:19] salvation it's not what I'm looking for
[1:27:22] to get me out of here but this is that
[1:27:25] bread which came down from heaven not as
[1:27:26] your fathers did eat mana and are dead
[1:27:28] he that eateth of this bread shall live
[1:27:32] forever and many of his disciples it's
[1:27:35] no wonder people can't understand it
[1:27:37] today many of jesus' disciples when they
[1:27:39] heard it said this is a hard saying who
[1:27:41] can hear it and he followed that up and
[1:27:44] said if that bothers you what will
[1:27:45] happen when you see me
[1:27:47] Ascend and and they come back and said
[1:27:49] from that time many of his disciples
[1:27:51] went back and walked no more with him
[1:27:53] and then Jesus said to the 12 will you
[1:27:55] also go away and Simon Peter answered
[1:27:57] him Lord to whom shall we go thou Hast
[1:28:00] the words of eternal life how can we
[1:28:02] leave you when you're our Oasis in the
[1:28:04] desert how can we leave this message
[1:28:06] when it's our water that we drink from
[1:28:09] how can we leave this message when it's
[1:28:10] our bread that we eat from the reason
[1:28:13] why it's easy for some people to live is
[1:28:15] it wasn't their to leave it wasn't their
[1:28:17] bread in the first
[1:28:20] place are you with me now amen
[1:28:24] thou Hast the
[1:28:26] words of eternal
[1:28:28] life they we're feeding on those words
[1:28:30] we live by the word the Bible said
[1:28:32] wherever the carcass is there will the
[1:28:34] Eagles be gathered together that's why I
[1:28:36] use quotes that's why we proclaim the
[1:28:38] message because I don't have a message
[1:28:39] of my own but I come to say what a
[1:28:41] prophet said and to preach to you a
[1:28:44] message not just to preach to you that's
[1:28:46] why you can't just get it say well I'll
[1:28:47] just stay home listen to tapes and I'll
[1:28:49] never have to hear a preacher no this
[1:28:51] message was not meant just to be heard
[1:28:53] but it was meant to be expressed
[1:28:54] expressed in a preacher expressed in a
[1:28:55] deacon expressed in a in a person
[1:28:57] sitting on the Pew and receiving the
[1:28:59] word of God a Believer saying amen it
[1:29:02] was meant to be
[1:29:05] expressed brother Brandon said I wasn't
[1:29:07] the one that appeared down on the river
[1:29:08] I was only standing there when he
[1:29:10] appeared I'm not the one that performs
[1:29:12] these things and foretells these things
[1:29:13] that happens as perfect as they are I'm
[1:29:15] the only one that's near when he does it
[1:29:17] I was only a voice that he used to say
[1:29:19] it it wasn't what I knew it's what I
[1:29:22] just surrendered myself to that he spoke
[1:29:24] through it isn't me it wasn't the
[1:29:26] seventh angel oh no it was the
[1:29:28] manifestation of the son of man it
[1:29:30] wasn't the angel his message it was the
[1:29:32] mystery that God unfolded that's why I'm
[1:29:33] not scared I'm not scared of this
[1:29:35] message I'm not scared of a prophet I'm
[1:29:37] not scared of those things because I
[1:29:38] understand his place it wasn't him it
[1:29:41] was a
[1:29:42] message amen it's not a man it's God the
[1:29:45] angel was not the son of man he was the
[1:29:47] messenger from the son of man the son of
[1:29:49] man is Christ he is the one what should
[1:29:52] our attitude be towards the message feed
[1:29:54] on it feed on it make it your daily
[1:29:57] bread What did the what did the mighty
[1:29:59] Angel tell John when the book was open
[1:30:02] he said take it and eat
[1:30:05] it oh take the book you got to take it
[1:30:07] yourself and eat it he said and in your
[1:30:10] mouth it'll be sweet as honey but in
[1:30:11] your belly it'll be bitter but you still
[1:30:13] eat it because that's what you live
[1:30:16] by he said you're not the son of man is
[1:30:19] Christ he's the one you're feeding on
[1:30:20] you're not feeding on a man man his
[1:30:22] words will fail but you're feeding on
[1:30:24] the unfailing body word of the son of
[1:30:25] man listen he's my bread he's my joy
[1:30:28] he's my peace he gets my vote are you
[1:30:30] with me now we're Eagles we're not Hawks
[1:30:32] not chickens our diet is the
[1:30:36] word I'm going to skip past this it's
[1:30:38] really good but you can go listen to it
[1:30:40] brother Brandon preached I'm GNA skip
[1:30:42] several quotes down brother Brandon
[1:30:44] preached about what an eagle would eat
[1:30:45] versus what a hawk would eat he talks
[1:30:48] about a hawk relying on half- Rotten
[1:30:50] man-made theology in a man-made Sunday
[1:30:52] school program sheet some educator
[1:30:55] killed for him in some Seminary tell him
[1:30:57] the days of Miracles has passed there's
[1:30:59] no such thing as the baptism of the Holy
[1:31:00] Ghost all this is nonsense he said you
[1:31:02] mean to tell me an eagle would eat that
[1:31:03] he couldn't do it why why couldn't he do
[1:31:06] it he's got a fresh kill he's not he's
[1:31:09] not a beggar anymore the son of man has
[1:31:11] been revealed and where the carcass is
[1:31:13] the Eagles will be
[1:31:17] gathered he said neither will a
[1:31:19] Christian eat on that dead of Karen from
[1:31:21] old denominational doctrines and things
[1:31:23] they want the word of God fresh the
[1:31:24] promise of the hour God promised rabbits
[1:31:26] the days of Luther he promised other
[1:31:27] things the days of others but now
[1:31:29] someone say now he promised us a full
[1:31:33] Square meal I like that the full seven
[1:31:36] course
[1:31:37] menu wouldn't it be terrible if you went

[1:32:12] energy for the afternoon service you

[1:32:21] had to eat was just a portion of the
[1:32:23] revealed

[1:32:58] meal for all someone say all the Seven

[1:33:37] that fear Him the Young Lions do lack
[1:33:41] and suffer hunger but they that seek the
[1:33:43] Lord shall not want any good thing other
[1:33:47] words they won't be
[1:33:48] lacking any good
[1:33:52] thing if you could play something softly
[1:33:54] what is the
[1:33:57] revealing of the son of
[1:34:01] man it's pulling the cover
[1:34:05] off of our
[1:34:10] food he told the woman at the well I'm
[1:34:12] the bread of
[1:34:14] life I'm the Water of Life he said if
[1:34:16] you drink from me you'll never be
[1:34:19] thirsty again
[1:34:20] [Music]
[1:34:26] sorry I get into stories I I get long
[1:34:29] but I went to
[1:34:32] Africa and it seems like when you go
[1:34:34] overseas some of you that have been
[1:34:36] brother Mike you know this is true when
[1:34:37] you go it's impressed in your memory you
[1:34:39] remember
[1:34:40] it and if you go overseas you it just
[1:34:44] stands out to me I went to
[1:34:46] Africa there was a
[1:34:49] silver container that was closed on this
[1:34:52] it was a beautiful place it's very poor
[1:34:55] we stay in a hotel because it's just the
[1:34:56] safest place you can stay armed guards
[1:34:59] on the
[1:35:00] outside so I'm standing at this hotel
[1:35:02] and they would have a breakfast every
[1:35:03] morning but you can't eat very much of
[1:35:05] it because everything they wash is
[1:35:08] washed with their water so you can't eat
[1:35:10] it or you get
[1:35:12] sick so we couldn't wash anything was
[1:35:16] cut or eat anything that was cut or had
[1:35:17] been washed or it was cold so you had to
[1:35:20] eat something hot so they had these
[1:35:22] these silver hot serving dishes You'
[1:35:25] seen them with a cover on
[1:35:27] them and I was looking forward to
[1:35:29] whatever was going to be in those in the
[1:35:31] morning and I'll never forget that first
[1:35:33] morning down I walked up there and
[1:35:36] I when I when I come up to the serving
[1:35:39] dish I oh this is going to be good and I
[1:35:40] opened it up you know what it was baked
[1:35:46] beans now that may not sound awful to
[1:35:48] you I don't eat baked beans at 8:00 in
[1:35:50] the morning
[1:35:54] and I thought well maybe the next one
[1:35:55] will have something else open baked
[1:35:58] beans there was three or four of them
[1:36:00] like that what in the world why would
[1:36:02] you bother hiding that from
[1:36:05] me but this food was so precious and it
[1:36:09] was so great he knew we would need it to
[1:36:12] go in a Rapture so he gives a part to
[1:36:14] Lutheran a part to Wesley and a part to
[1:36:16] this one a part to that one but he saved
[1:36:18] a seven qu meal for my day because he
[1:36:21] knew I'd be hungry for it he knew I'd
[1:36:23] need the strength to make it in a
[1:36:24] Rapture so what does he do he pulls the
[1:36:27] cover off the table and said go eat
[1:36:29] Church go eat this is
[1:36:32] me what should our attitude toward the
[1:36:34] message be it should not be yesterday's
[1:36:36] thought it should not be well it's
[1:36:38] something my parents believe it ought to
[1:36:40] be every one of us digging into it and
[1:36:42] believing it and trusting in it Lord
[1:36:44] speak to me through your word speak to
[1:36:46] me by the revealing of the son of man
[1:36:49] speak to me today the same God God
[1:36:52] brought you in this message for reason
[1:36:54] Paul sitting down there with a great
[1:36:55] testimony of how God met him in Africa
[1:36:58] and God brought him into this message in
[1:36:59] a foreign land god revealed somebody
[1:37:02] told him about the message that was a
[1:37:03] real Christian what was it the son of
[1:37:05] man being revealed not through the body
[1:37:07] of a prophet but through the body of
[1:37:09] that young man that met brother Paul in
[1:37:11] West Africa are you hearing me today God
[1:37:14] wants to reveal himself through you and
[1:37:16] to you he wants you to eat so you can
[1:37:20] become the revealing of the son of man
[1:37:23] in your hour
