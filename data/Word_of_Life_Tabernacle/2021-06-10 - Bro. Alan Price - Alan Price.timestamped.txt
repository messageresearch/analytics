[32:03] jesus christ's name we pray
[32:05] amen amen you love the lord this evening
[32:09] if you would turn with me to romans
[32:11] chapter 8 and verse 1.
[32:14] let me just read a quick scripture here
[32:18] and
[32:19] i wrote down i want to remember it was
[32:21] my wife's 30th birthday yesterday
[32:24] so happy birthday to her she uh she
[32:27] joined
[32:28] the 3-0 club and doesn't want me to tell
[32:30] anybody but i'm going to
[32:32] so hey man no i've been really blessed
[32:36] it was her birthday yesterday so we we
[32:38] got to spend the day together
[32:39] mom watched the kids so it was really
[32:41] nice to
[32:43] have a glimpse of what it was like
[32:44] before children and it's really funny we
[32:46] were sitting there eating and just
[32:47] wondering what our kids were doing so
[32:50] you know but i definitely appreciate my
[32:52] wife i wouldn't be
[32:54] where i am if it wasn't for her and
[32:55] definitely blessed and i married up
[32:58] amen so if you would with me turn with
[33:00] me to romans chapter eight and verse one
[33:02] and no i'm not in trouble that i'm
[33:04] talking about my wife so i'm not trying
[33:06] to dig myself out anything i'm just
[33:07] being honest so
[33:08] i seen stuart back there looking a
[33:10] little bit but
[33:11] so i'd like to preach this even if we
[33:13] could on the same spirit
[33:14] romans 8 and verse 1 there is therefore
[33:17] now no condemnation to them which
[33:19] are in christ jesus who walked not after
[33:21] the flesh but after the spirit
[33:24] for the law of the spirit of life in
[33:26] christ jesus hath made me free
[33:28] from the law of sin and death for what
[33:31] the law
[33:32] could not do in that it was weak through
[33:34] the flesh
[33:35] god sending his own son in the likeness
[33:38] of sinful flesh and for sin
[33:39] condemned sin in the flesh that the
[33:42] righteousness of the law might be
[33:44] fulfilled in us
[33:45] who walk not after the flesh but in this
[33:47] but after the spirit
[33:49] and with that with the reading of word
[33:50] you can have your seats this evening
[33:53] i won't take up much of your time this
[33:55] evening just
[33:58] have a little thought on my heart and
[33:59] kind of had been studying
[34:01] studying something else and and the lord
[34:03] just kind of changed it just at the last
[34:05] moment and kind of went this direction
[34:06] so i just pray it's for someone here
[34:09] amen that god would just speak to your
[34:11] speak to your heart
[34:13] i'd like to look on the same spirit if i
[34:15] could tonight i'm going to reread that
[34:16] scripture and just kind of continue on
[34:17] down
[34:18] through down through the scripture here
[34:20] and and just just
[34:21] pour out our hearts just a little bit
[34:23] this evening and so back to verse one it
[34:25] says there is therefore now no
[34:26] condemnation to them which are in christ
[34:28] jesus who walk not after the flesh but
[34:30] after the spirit
[34:32] and we know as believers when we when we
[34:33] surrender our lives to christ our
[34:36] our whole life goal changes from walking
[34:38] after the flesh to walking after the
[34:40] spirit is that right now it's
[34:41] it's not that we quit our jobs we're not
[34:43] that we quit our relationships quit our
[34:45] friends or
[34:46] or do this now those that are bad
[34:47] influences we might we might pull
[34:49] ourselves away from but
[34:50] but we're not ending everything here but
[34:52] our main focus is is to walk after
[34:54] christ
[34:55] is that right now in verse 2 for the law
[34:58] of the spirit of the life
[34:59] in christ jesus hath made me free from
[35:02] the law of sin and death so we see in
[35:03] that scripture there there's two laws
[35:05] the law of the spirit of the life in
[35:07] christ jesus
[35:09] and then the law of sin and death now
[35:11] for what the law
[35:12] could not do in that it was weak through
[35:14] the flesh god sending his own son in
[35:17] likeness of sinful flesh
[35:19] for sin condemned sin in the flesh that
[35:22] the righteousness of the law might be
[35:23] fulfilled in
[35:24] us who walk not after the flesh but
[35:26] after the spirit
[35:27] and that's not our righteousness it's
[35:29] not the righteousness of brother steward
[35:30] or not the righteousness of brother
[35:32] caleb
[35:32] not allen's righteousness but it's the
[35:34] righteousness of jesus christ
[35:36] is that right we ought not think highly
[35:38] of ourselves we not to think we're
[35:39] better than this one or that one
[35:41] we all had to come the same way and
[35:42] that's through the blood of jesus christ
[35:44] is that right
[35:46] he says for they are the for they that
[35:48] are after the flesh do mine the things
[35:50] of the flesh but they that are after the
[35:52] spirit the things of the spirit
[35:54] and so we know that when we had a nature
[35:55] change the flesh was no longer in charge
[35:58] but it was the holy ghost on the inside
[36:00] controlling the flesh is that right
[36:02] for to be carnally minded as death and
[36:04] but to be spiritually minded is life and
[36:06] peace
[36:07] because the carnal mind is enmity
[36:09] against god for it is not subject to the
[36:11] law of god neither indeed can be
[36:14] so then they that are in the flesh
[36:16] cannot please god but you're not in the
[36:17] flesh but in the spirit
[36:19] if so be that the spirit of god dwell in
[36:22] you now if any man have not the spirit
[36:23] of christ he is none of his
[36:26] and if christ be in you the body is dead
[36:28] because of sin
[36:29] but the spirit is life because of
[36:31] righteousness
[36:32] but if the spirit of him that raised
[36:34] jesus from the dead dwell in you
[36:36] he that raised christ from the dead
[36:38] shall also quicken
[36:39] your mortal bodies by his spirit that
[36:42] dwell in you
[36:43] so we see that that scripture if we have
[36:44] the same spirit that christ had
[36:46] the same one that raised him from the
[36:48] dead will raise us from the dead as well
[36:50] is that right
[36:51] so we see that there's two laws the law
[36:53] of sin and death and then the law this
[36:55] of the spirit of life in christ jesus
[36:57] now we see in the garden of eden
[36:59] when adam and eve when the fall took
[37:01] place adam had a conditional covenant
[37:03] with
[37:03] with god is that right and the condition
[37:05] was to eat not of the fruit of the tree
[37:08] of good and evil is that right that was
[37:09] the condition if you look
[37:11] through the scripture you see other
[37:12] conditional promises that god made it
[37:14] was
[37:14] just like samson he had the condition
[37:16] not to cut his hair is that right and
[37:18] and so he could have his strength he
[37:20] could do all these mighty things as long
[37:22] as he did not do the conditional
[37:24] covenant that god had made and we see
[37:26] down through our lives you make
[37:28] you know we make promises you know i i
[37:30] promise to pay this much to buy this
[37:32] item from you or
[37:33] i promise to do this for you if you'll
[37:35] do this for me and we see those are on
[37:37] conditions you know i'm not going to
[37:40] say i'm selling an item i'm not going to
[37:42] sell you this unless you promise to pay
[37:44] me a specific amount
[37:45] is that right now we look at many times
[37:48] in our human
[37:50] walk how many times we actually break a
[37:52] promise i know
[37:53] as far as a parent goes i feel like i
[37:56] break promises all the time because you
[37:57] know
[37:57] i tell brother ben yes i'll be here
[37:59] sunday then a kid gets sick and i'm not
[38:00] here
[38:01] now that's something that i couldn't
[38:02] control or something i didn't
[38:04] i didn't foresee but it still i broke
[38:06] that promise that i was going to be here
[38:08] if
[38:08] i tell my kids after work we'll we'll go
[38:11] down to the creek and we'll play and
[38:12] we'll have a good time well then i have
[38:13] a really rough day at work a long day at
[38:15] work and when i get home i'm too tired
[38:17] and so i break that promise and so we
[38:19] see that those are on conditions you
[38:21] know i i should have said if daddy
[38:23] feels good when he gets home if he's not
[38:24] tired if he's not wore out
[38:26] then we'll go to the creek and that's on
[38:27] condition is that right
[38:29] now and men begin trying to get back in
[38:32] after the garden of eden after adam and
[38:33] eve were kicked out of the garden of
[38:34] eden we see immediately men
[38:36] begin trying to get back to eternal life
[38:38] trying to get back to god and we see
[38:40] that through cain and abel
[38:41] and we see that cain had begun to had
[38:44] had begin to worship just as abel was
[38:46] beginning to worship and brother branham
[38:47] says and i will restore in 53 says
[38:49] anyhow
[38:50] when the angel began to pull his flaming
[38:51] sword out out to guard this tree of life
[38:54] he says now watch
[38:55] cain and abel both came to find favor
[38:57] with god he says amen he says now look
[38:59] cain was a long ways from being a
[39:01] communist neither was he an atheist but
[39:02] cain was a believer
[39:04] he said get on your shock proof vest now
[39:06] he said cain was a believer and a
[39:07] worshiper of god
[39:09] and so we see if we look at it cain
[39:10] actually worked harder in his worship
[39:12] than abel did
[39:14] cain he grew the fruits he tilled the
[39:15] ground he did these things and he
[39:17] brought the sacrifice to god
[39:19] and he said and brother branham goes on
[39:20] he says now if god only required a
[39:22] believer
[39:22] cain was just as as just as a believer
[39:25] as abel was
[39:26] and he said and god would be unjust if
[39:28] he condemned cain for his faith in him
[39:31] and accepted abel he says if faith was
[39:32] all he required he says all right
[39:34] but cain came and offered a sacrifice
[39:36] now look
[39:37] cain built an altar a church cain made a
[39:39] sacrifice just the same as abel did
[39:42] and cain worshipped he never come as an
[39:44] unbeliever he come as a believer
[39:46] he raised his hands and worshiped god
[39:48] just the same as abel did he says well
[39:50] if a church membership an
[39:51] altar and a worship or a sacrifice is
[39:53] all god requires
[39:54] then cain was just as able was but we
[39:57] see there was something different is
[39:59] that right abel had a revelation of what
[40:01] god required is that right
[40:03] that's why you know i don't believe
[40:04] legalism will get you anywhere it's got
[40:06] to be a change on the inside
[40:08] that changes the outside is that right i
[40:10] love this brother branham says and
[40:11] believe us though this he says you don't
[40:13] entice god by the way you dress you
[40:15] entice god by the way you live
[40:17] think and act you believe that this
[40:19] evening so we see that legalism wasn't
[40:21] enough to change somebody that it was
[40:23] that was enough to change a person
[40:25] wasn't enough to change the soul you can
[40:27] dress the right way you can talk the
[40:29] right way
[40:30] walk the right way do everything the
[40:32] right way and still die
[40:34] and go to hell and what a shame it would
[40:35] be to do all those things and not accept
[40:38] the spirit of the living god in this day
[40:41] so we see that legalism won't get you
[40:42] anywhere and i'm not here to just preach
[40:44] all grace and all legalism or or this or
[40:47] that and
[40:47] i really like how brother josh said it
[40:49] he he spoke saturday night and
[40:51] and just did a terrific job and if you
[40:53] if you want to get a tape to listen to
[40:55] i'd highly recommend that one
[40:57] or cd um um i still have an old enough
[41:00] truck that i have a tape player but uh
[41:01] but if you want to get the cd on that
[41:03] i'm sure it was good but he preached on
[41:05] judging him faithful and it was just an
[41:06] amazing service but
[41:08] he put that you know he wasn't preaching
[41:09] greasy grace or that you can do anything
[41:11] but once you meet christ it'll change
[41:13] your life to where you'll live
[41:14] told to the message is that right now
[41:16] brother braham says and i will restore
[41:18] in 53 says if you belong to a church or
[41:20] go to church or got your name on a
[41:21] church book and a good tithe player a
[41:23] worshiper
[41:24] he said sincerity says still that isn't
[41:26] it he said that's right he said i don't
[41:28] want to hurt you but i've got to stand
[41:29] before judgment with you and god
[41:31] requires more than that
[41:33] and cain was just as able was if that
[41:36] was
[41:36] all that god required you know a lot of
[41:39] people it used to be you know if i just
[41:40] go to church i'll go to heaven and now
[41:42] anymore you don't even have to go to
[41:43] church to get into heaven you just have
[41:44] to be a good person
[41:45] you just have to do this or do that and
[41:47] now it seems to be in this age people
[41:49] don't even care if they go to heaven
[41:50] anymore
[41:51] and so we see that down through time it
[41:52] just seems like the age gets darker and
[41:54] darker and
[41:55] he continues on he says now i want you
[41:56] to notice cain built his big fine altar
[41:59] and he says i can imagine him being a
[42:00] tiller of the soul
[42:02] filled it full of easter flowers and
[42:03] everything and made it beautiful and he
[42:05] was the nature of satan
[42:06] and today we have chimes on the churches
[42:08] and plus pews and
[42:10] and everything else trying to find favor
[42:11] with god and that's not
[42:13] god's way of finding favor he said every
[42:16] easter you go to church and they did and
[42:18] bid you merry christmas because they
[42:19] won't see you anymore until
[42:20] arm full of easter flowers and throw
[42:22] them on the altar and
[42:24] or they won't see you anymore till
[42:25] christmas and come easter you show off
[42:27] the new hat or new bonnet or new suit of
[42:29] clothes and bring up an armful of easter
[42:30] flowers and then
[42:32] and then throw them on the altar god
[42:33] doesn't want easter flowers on the altar
[42:35] he wants
[42:36] you on the altar he says you're the one
[42:38] that belongs on the altar so we see that
[42:40] god doesn't care about the outside he
[42:42] doesn't care about the pomp and prim
[42:43] things that we want to do
[42:45] he cares about the soul of an individual
[42:47] is that right
[42:48] that's why you've got to get christ to
[42:50] change you it's not the law that can
[42:51] change you but it's the grace that
[42:53] changes you from the inside out
[42:55] now i'm not against a holy life you must
[42:57] have a nature change to bring about that
[42:59] holy life
[43:00] and what i mean by that is is you know
[43:03] you can dress like
[43:04] i could dress up like a football player
[43:05] i could put on a helmet and pads and
[43:08] everything and walk out to the nfl but
[43:09] something on the inside ain't right
[43:11] i'm gonna get crushed i'm gonna get
[43:12] destroyed because what's on the inside
[43:14] doesn't match what's on the outside is
[43:16] that right
[43:17] and so now if you've got an nfl player
[43:19] and they put on the pads and the helmet
[43:20] and everything else and they go out
[43:22] there
[43:22] they can make a difference and so as a
[43:24] christian it's not good enough
[43:26] just to dress like one or act like one
[43:28] or sing like one or talk like one it's
[43:30] the soul
[43:31] it's the spirit on the inside when you
[43:32] come up against the enemy it's that
[43:34] spirit that satan recognizes
[43:36] and realizes that he has to move and get
[43:38] out of the way is that right now we see
[43:40] that cain and abel offered their
[43:42] sacrifice and they had to be identified
[43:44] within their sacrifice and so we see
[43:47] that cain was not identified in abel's
[43:49] sacrifice nor was abel identified in
[43:51] cain's sacrifice is that right
[43:55] that's why i couldn't make it in on my
[43:57] parents you can't make it in on your
[43:58] parents
[43:59] you can't make it in on your husband
[44:01] your wife it's got to be you
[44:02] identified with a sacrifice that you
[44:05] bring before cry before god is that
[44:07] right
[44:08] he said it's back to god's original
[44:09] decision at the first conference in eden
[44:12] he said back to the blood he said the
[44:13] jew in the old days he says now i'm
[44:15] coming down home for pentecost in just a
[44:17] few minutes
[44:19] he said in the old days when god
[44:20] accepted this substitute he says how the
[44:22] jew used to come down the road with a
[44:24] slick bull a sick bullock
[44:26] and he would say you know i'm a sinner
[44:28] and jehovah requires me to offer blood
[44:31] so he goes and gets his lamb for his
[44:33] bullock and he takes it down to the high
[44:35] priest down to the temple and he lays
[44:37] his hands upon his sacrifice he says
[44:39] what does that do
[44:40] he says it identifies the worshiper with
[44:43] his sacrifice
[44:44] and as believers in this day we have to
[44:46] be identified with our sacrifice and who
[44:48] was our sacrifice
[44:50] it was jesus christ is that right so we
[44:52] have to be identified with him
[44:54] in this day and he says and the priest
[44:56] comes and kills the bullock and catches
[44:58] the blood and sprinkles it upon them
[45:00] and he said the worshiper sincerely
[45:02] knowing he says this jew
[45:04] and that's what jehovah required of him
[45:06] he says the man went home with a good
[45:08] feeling
[45:08] he said filling the quivering and
[45:10] shaking of the lamb the blood spraying
[45:11] all over his hands and so forth
[45:13] and see that little fellow kicking and
[45:15] dying as they cut his throat he said he
[45:16] know that that ought to have been him
[45:19] he looked at his sacrifice and he
[45:21] identified himself by the laying his
[45:23] hands upon
[45:23] it he said i should be that one and then
[45:26] when it
[45:27] they cut his throat dying and bleeding
[45:28] and going on he says oh the little
[45:30] fellow quivering and and quieting down
[45:32] and the worshiper standing there and
[45:33] saying oh jehovah you've accepted that
[45:35] instead of me and i'm ashamed of myself
[45:37] and when the man went home justified is
[45:39] because he had done exactly what jehovah
[45:42] required
[45:43] that was fine so we see back in the old
[45:45] testament that was okay because that's
[45:47] what god required is that right but
[45:49] that's not what god requires in this day
[45:51] hebrews 10 and verse 1 for the law
[45:53] having a shadow of good things to come
[45:56] and not the very image of things can
[45:58] never with those sacrifices
[46:00] which they offered year by year
[46:01] continually to make the comers there and
[46:04] too perfect
[46:05] so we see that the the sacrifices of the
[46:07] bulls and goats
[46:08] was a shadow of the good thing to come
[46:11] for you and i is that right
[46:12] but even in the scripture says with
[46:14] those sacrifices which they offered year
[46:16] by year continually
[46:18] could not make the comers there unto
[46:21] perfect
[46:22] now in the second verse is for then when
[46:24] they uh
[46:26] for then would they have not ceased to
[46:28] be offered because that the worshipers
[46:30] once purged should have
[46:31] no more conscience of sins but in those
[46:34] sacrifice there was a remembrance again
[46:36] made of sin
[46:38] every year for it is not possible that
[46:40] the blood of bulls and goats could take
[46:42] away sin so we see that it was just a
[46:44] covering of the sin
[46:46] but every year there was a made a
[46:47] remembrance through that sacrifice
[46:49] of the sin is that right but as
[46:52] believers in jesus christ as that as
[46:54] our sacrifice trying not to get ahead of
[46:56] myself here but there's no more
[46:57] remembrance of sin now you may remember
[46:59] that sin
[47:00] you may remember the things that you
[47:01] used to do the person you used to be but
[47:03] god has put it in a sea of forgetfulness
[47:05] never to be brought up again as that
[47:07] right and i believe that brother branham
[47:09] says it was laid back
[47:10] upon the back of the accuser and
[47:11] everything that you had done he will now
[47:13] be judged for is that right
[47:15] are you thankful for that today amen do
[47:17] you love the lord this evening
[47:22] amen we did at work today and just to
[47:24] just kind of
[47:25] give you this just here for a few
[47:26] moments we did this thing at work it's
[47:28] called predictive index and it
[47:29] and it allows you to to identify the
[47:32] behavioral tendencies in people and so
[47:34] um i wasn't a really big believer of it
[47:36] at first but then they they ask you to
[47:38] do it
[47:39] and it's just a bunch of algorithms and
[47:42] you go out and you fill
[47:42] all these questions out and you just
[47:44] answer question after question after
[47:46] question and it's called predictive
[47:47] index and it's pretty neat
[47:49] um and you know it doesn't change a
[47:51] person it just tells you who they are
[47:54] and so you know looking at mine today
[47:55] i'm a very um
[47:57] i'm not a team work person now i love
[48:00] teamwork
[48:01] but i work better alone i don't like to
[48:04] be judged for other people's mistakes if
[48:06] we're doing a group project
[48:07] i want to make sure people know what
[48:09] part of that project i did
[48:11] and that sounds selfish but they
[48:13] identify that in you because they know
[48:14] don't put allen with a team because he's
[48:16] going to try to either take charge or
[48:18] run off and just leave the team and
[48:19] there are people like that and there's
[48:21] other people the lady that i sat next to
[48:22] we were complete polar opposites
[48:24] she was team oriented she didn't like
[48:26] conflict
[48:27] i was not team oriented and i could deal
[48:29] with conflict it wasn't i said i didn't
[48:31] like conflict but i'd rather get it over
[48:33] with she wanted to sweep it under the
[48:34] rug and never deal with it
[48:35] i wanted to just go ahead and talk about
[48:37] it get it over with and throw it behind
[48:38] him
[48:39] and so we see that each individual as
[48:41] humans our human nature we have
[48:42] predictive
[48:43] we have indexes that that rule our human
[48:46] nature is that right
[48:48] you know i look at look at matinee and
[48:50] paxton and piper
[48:51] and i can't discipline them the same all
[48:54] just across the board that everything is
[48:55] disciplined i just learned this one the
[48:57] same this one the same and this one the
[48:58] same
[48:59] because they have different natures you
[49:00] know one you can say one thing too and
[49:02] it just breaks their heart they break
[49:03] down
[49:04] one you have to beat the other one we're
[49:06] just not sure yet we know she's going to
[49:07] be tougher than the other two so
[49:09] so you really don't know you have to
[49:10] treat each one separately is that right
[49:13] and so we look and that's why jesus
[49:15] loves a multi-membered body because each
[49:17] one has a position and a place
[49:19] each one has a purpose in the body of
[49:21] jesus christ now
[49:23] what i'm going to say that for is
[49:25] because i can look at my predictive
[49:27] index and see what type of a person that
[49:29] i am
[49:30] now they say how difficult it is to
[49:33] change
[49:34] the the type of person you are what they
[49:36] call the behaviorals and needs
[49:39] and so the further you are away from the
[49:41] midline the harder it is to change and
[49:43] so they
[49:44] like a type a is dominance and so if
[49:46] it's far right that's a really dominant
[49:48] person if it's far left that's not a
[49:50] dominant person and
[49:51] and so they go through all these things
[49:52] and the further you are from this line
[49:54] the harder it is to change
[49:56] and so you know and and you know they
[49:59] they like people to use this in their
[50:00] marriages raising their children and
[50:01] in hiring people and and it is a really
[50:04] good tool because it identifies where to
[50:06] place people
[50:07] you know if you've got a team oriented
[50:08] person you probably want them to be in
[50:10] management over people if you've got a
[50:12] goal-oriented person or
[50:14] a self-individual person or self-starter
[50:17] you want to put them over in this
[50:18] position and you want them to not be
[50:20] troubled by anybody else and so we see
[50:22] that
[50:23] our human nature can get in the way of
[50:25] what our christ-like nature
[50:28] needs to be is that right and it's very
[50:30] difficult to change but the holy ghost
[50:32] is the only way you're going to overcome
[50:33] that nature
[50:34] and so what i'm trying to say is no
[50:36] matter how far right or how far left you
[50:38] are
[50:39] the holy ghost is the only thing that i
[50:41] know of on the on
[50:42] on the earth that can actually control
[50:44] human nature and that's jesus christ
[50:46] right
[50:47] now we see that that was just a covering
[50:49] i'm going to get back to my notes now
[50:51] and
[50:51] and brother branham says in the
[50:52] philadelphia and church age he says
[50:53] israel used to take the red heifer and
[50:55] sacrifice her upon the altar
[50:57] for the remission of sins for a year the
[51:00] the he said the sins of the guilty was
[51:02] was covered for one year he said but
[51:05] that covering could not take away the
[51:07] desire of sin
[51:09] so that's the important piece it could
[51:10] not take away the desire of sin it could
[51:12] cover the sin
[51:13] but it couldn't take away that nature
[51:15] that that desire to
[51:17] to go back out and recommit the sin and
[51:20] so it says so each year the man would
[51:21] sacrifice or excuse me it was not a
[51:23] perfect offering it was just a shadow
[51:25] until the real one
[51:26] came along you thankful for the real one
[51:28] this evening he said so each year the
[51:30] man would sacrifice and each year come
[51:32] back because he still had the same
[51:34] desire to sin
[51:35] and the life of the animal atoned for
[51:37] that sin but being the animal blood
[51:39] that was shed in the animal life that
[51:41] was given it could not come back upon
[51:43] the man
[51:44] and it says if it had come back it still
[51:46] would not be availed but when
[51:48] christ the perfect substitute was given
[51:51] his blood was shed and then the life
[51:52] that was in christ
[51:54] came back upon the repentant sinner
[51:57] and that life being perfect of christ
[51:59] sinless and righteous
[52:01] then the guilty one could go free for he
[52:03] had no desire to sin
[52:05] the life of jesus had come back upon him
[52:08] he said see that's what it means in
[52:09] romans 8 2 the law
[52:10] of the spirit of life in christ jesus
[52:12] hath made me free
[52:14] from the law of sin and death now we
[52:16] know as believers that
[52:18] that whenever we are saved and filled
[52:20] with the holy ghost
[52:21] that doesn't mean you're not tempted
[52:23] right i know many of us are tempted
[52:24] daily we're tempted and tried and
[52:26] and it doesn't mean that every life's
[52:28] going to be perfect and you're no longer
[52:29] even going to have a desire to do
[52:31] anything bad or
[52:32] not even be tempted to do anything wrong
[52:33] or tempted to say anything or talk or
[52:35] gossip or do any of this
[52:37] that's not what the promise said but
[52:38] it's it takes away that desire when the
[52:40] holy spirit comes it takes away that
[52:42] desire to sin that iniquity
[52:44] to for us to go out and purposely sin do
[52:46] you understand that this evening
[52:48] amen do you love the lord
[52:52] i mean are you thankful for that perfect
[52:54] sacrifice
[52:56] hebrews 10 and 10. he says now by the
[52:58] which we are all sanctified through the
[53:01] offering of the body of jesus christ
[53:03] once and for all and every priest
[53:05] standeth daily ministering and offering
[53:08] often times the same sacrifices which
[53:10] can never
[53:11] take away sins but this man after he had
[53:15] offered
[53:15] one sacrifice for sins forever setting
[53:18] down
[53:19] at the right hand of god and i love this
[53:21] albert barnes and his notes here he says
[53:23] but this man
[53:24] and he goes back to the greek and his
[53:26] notes say the lord jesus
[53:28] he said this word man is not in the
[53:29] original uh
[53:31] here he says it's not the greek greek
[53:33] literal meaning for man but it's the
[53:35] greek
[53:35] greek literal meaning for priest so it
[53:38] says but this priest the lord jesus
[53:40] but this man after he'd offered one
[53:42] sacrifice for sins forever
[53:44] sat down at the right hand of god so he
[53:46] was saying that that was our high priest
[53:48] do you believe that
[53:49] and it said after he had offered one
[53:50] sacrifice for sins by dying on the cross
[53:53] he did this but once
[53:54] for it was sufficient for the sins of
[53:57] the world so we see that when he done
[53:59] this
[53:59] there was nothing else that could happen
[54:01] that that blood could not cover is that
[54:03] right
[54:04] there was nothing you could do nothing i
[54:05] could do that could get to
[54:07] could go to a situation where the blood
[54:08] was not powerful enough to take that sin
[54:11] away
[54:11] and wash it completely from the believer
[54:13] do you believe that
[54:14] well on down to verse 13 and from
[54:16] henceforth expecting till his enemies be
[54:18] made his footstool
[54:20] he says for by what offering he hath
[54:22] perfected forever them
[54:24] that are sanctified are you thankful for
[54:26] that
[54:27] he said whereof the holy ghost also was
[54:30] a witness to us that
[54:31] after he had said before this is the
[54:33] covenant that i will make with them
[54:35] after those days saith the lord i will
[54:37] put my laws
[54:39] into their hearts and in their minds
[54:41] will i write them
[54:42] and their sins and iniquities will i
[54:44] remember no more and so i'm thankful for
[54:47] that that
[54:47] everything that we had committed
[54:48] everything that we had done wrong is
[54:50] laid back upon the accuser and he will
[54:52] be judged that day
[54:54] for those things and so we see that it
[54:56] will be remembered no more
[54:57] by god is that right now i looked here
[55:00] and i just did some numbers i like
[55:02] numbers and it doesn't mean anything i'm
[55:03] not typifying anything but
[55:05] if each israelite made a sacrifice just
[55:08] for for one year during the 40-year
[55:10] period in the wilderness that have been
[55:11] about 80 million sacrifices
[55:14] and so we and i'm looking at the the 2
[55:16] million so we're looking at the children
[55:17] of israel if they made
[55:18] one sacrifice every year for 40 years
[55:20] that's around 80 million sacrifices and
[55:22] if i did the math right if not i'm a
[55:24] banker so forgive me but
[55:26] millions of gallons of blood that was
[55:28] spilled but that was still not enough
[55:30] is that right but when christ came it
[55:32] was one sacrifice
[55:34] it was enough to do away with the sins
[55:36] of not just you and i but of the whole
[55:38] world do you believe that today so it
[55:40] says we see whenever that when that
[55:41] spirit of christ whenever that blood was
[55:43] shed it wasn't just shed for the
[55:44] covering of sins it wasn't just shed for
[55:46] this or for that or for our healing
[55:48] but it was to bring that life back upon
[55:50] the believer when he raised from the
[55:51] dead and that spirit that holy ghost was
[55:53] given back
[55:54] in measure to you and i that's what it
[55:55] was about amen
[55:57] so you see you must be born again and we
[55:59] know that if there's a seed in there the
[56:00] word we're quick in it is that right
[56:02] if you if you come to church and no
[56:04] matter who's preaching if they're
[56:05] preaching the word of god
[56:06] you know that if you've got a seed in
[56:08] your heart if you've got a seed in your
[56:09] soul
[56:10] the the word will quicken that seed is
[56:12] that right you know if i went out
[56:14] tomorrow and bought just some potting
[56:16] soil and it had no seed in it no
[56:17] no nothing had no seeds and i began to
[56:19] water it nothing's going to come up is
[56:21] that right
[56:22] but you put a little grain of grass in
[56:23] there a little seed a little flower
[56:25] something like that you pour some water
[56:26] on it and it will come to life
[56:28] is that right you get into get it into
[56:31] the atmosphere of the sun and
[56:32] and things will begin to happen do you
[56:34] believe that do you love the lord this
[56:36] evening
[56:38] i mean my wife yesterday we were walking
[56:40] around and we were looking at plants and
[56:42] she's like i was like what do you want
[56:43] to buy something she's like no i'm just
[56:44] looking at the ones that if we got we'd
[56:45] take them home and kill them and
[56:47] and so you know we we're not we're not
[56:49] green thumb people
[56:50] you know my mom she can she can grow
[56:52] flowers and stuff and me and jen have
[56:53] tried for 10 years
[56:55] i don't think we've had one plant ever
[56:57] make it more than a year
[56:59] we've tried we just we just don't have
[57:01] that about us now
[57:03] that doesn't mean we're bad at other
[57:05] things just like the predictive index we
[57:06] have our strengths
[57:08] and we have our weaknesses and i believe
[57:11] as christians you know that's one thing
[57:13] many times um uh one thing that this
[57:16] predictive index i really like and i was
[57:17] in it a lot today for about eight hours
[57:19] and so i may talk about a little bit but
[57:21] it identifies your weaknesses very well
[57:23] and so a lot of people like to hide from
[57:25] their weaknesses like put them in the
[57:26] closet i'm gonna talk about it
[57:27] and then in their mind all they focus on
[57:29] is their weaknesses right
[57:31] and so the good thing is is as
[57:32] christians you know and as husband and
[57:34] wife
[57:35] and parents you ought to identify the
[57:37] weaknesses and you ought to work on
[57:39] those it's not something we hide or you
[57:40] know it's something we
[57:41] may be ashamed of but we ought to try to
[57:43] become better
[57:44] not not we focus on them now we do this
[57:46] or that but we ought to recognize them
[57:47] and then try to become better
[57:49] is that right you know if you you know
[57:51] me i'm i'm hard-headed and
[57:53] uh you know my predictive index says i'm
[57:55] impatient and and
[57:56] and so i was like you know those are
[57:58] true and some people
[57:59] when somebody calls me and wants a loan
[58:01] done and they want it that day and
[58:02] patience is good
[58:03] because i go and fight and try to get it
[58:05] done but
[58:06] if i'm trying to load up the car with
[58:08] the kids and my wife being impatient is
[58:10] not a good thing
[58:11] and so you have to identify these
[58:12] strengths and these weaknesses and then
[58:13] you have to recognize them and you have
[58:15] to know
[58:16] when to use them when to assert them and
[58:18] and how how it goes with your family how
[58:19] it goes with your work life and even how
[58:21] it goes
[58:22] into your church life because a lot of
[58:24] people come into the church
[58:26] not being spiritually minded still
[58:28] thinking about the things that happen at
[58:30] work
[58:30] just like i may be even doing tonight
[58:32] still thinking about the things that
[58:34] happen at home
[58:34] and when we come into the church we
[58:36] ought to be so focused on christ that
[58:38] none of those things matter is that
[58:39] right
[58:40] that whenever the pastor is preaching
[58:42] whenever he's speaking up here that he's
[58:43] not having to fight through this or
[58:44] fight through that because we've come
[58:46] prepared we've we've been like ground
[58:48] that's been tilled by the tiller
[58:50] or dissed up and we're ready to receive
[58:52] what god has got for us is that right
[58:54] now brother brahm says in the token in
[58:56] 1964 he says now our sacrifice today not
[58:59] only an
[58:59] ordinary human being but it was god
[59:01] himself that was identified in flesh
[59:03] here upon the earth
[59:05] and when that blood cell was broke not
[59:06] only did the soul of man or a spirit of
[59:09] man
[59:09] but it was god himself who was
[59:11] identified in that man
[59:14] returns back upon the believer in the
[59:16] baptism of the holy spirit
[59:17] so we spoke about this a little bit last
[59:19] week the same life that was in christ
[59:22] now is in the believer
[59:23] not in the not in the same measure that
[59:26] he had it but we still have
[59:28] a measure of that life of christ now he
[59:30] said that's the
[59:31] token that god requires today the token
[59:34] of today that we have to have
[59:36] must be the holy spirit that's god's
[59:39] required token
[59:40] he said we'll prove it to you by the
[59:41] scriptures he said without the holy
[59:43] spirit you do not
[59:44] display the token he said that
[59:47] is he said that's the token show that he
[59:50] says that you have been identified
[59:51] yourself with your sacrifice
[59:54] and god has sent you back the token to
[59:56] show that you've been accepted
[59:57] he said until that's done no matter how
[59:59] good you are how much you know
[1:00:02] he said how a college professor a good
[1:00:04] person a preacher whatever it might be
[1:00:05] you're absolutely not recognized until
[1:00:08] you can show
[1:00:09] the token so we see that to be
[1:00:11] identified with our sacrifice we must
[1:00:13] show the token is that right we must
[1:00:15] have that life of christ the holy ghost
[1:00:17] living
[1:00:18] in on the inside of us on that control
[1:00:20] tower is that right
[1:00:22] you know we can say well i went to
[1:00:23] church well so did cain you know i sang
[1:00:25] well so did cain i dressed right well so
[1:00:27] did cain i did this
[1:00:28] so did cain but it's all about that
[1:00:30] sacrifice is that right
[1:00:31] it was the revelation of what we needed
[1:00:33] to be worshipping
[1:00:34] in is that right he said in the token
[1:00:37] continue on down he says we have to
[1:00:38] identify ourselves with our sacrifice
[1:00:41] we have to be identified in his death
[1:00:43] when a jew placed his hand upon the
[1:00:45] sacrifice he was identifying himself
[1:00:47] transferring his sins to his sacrifice
[1:00:51] and the sacrifice died he says now we
[1:00:53] place our hands by
[1:00:54] faith upon jesus christ and are
[1:00:57] identified with him
[1:00:58] in his death not only in his death but
[1:01:00] if we're accepted we're identified not
[1:01:02] only in his death but in his
[1:01:03] resurrection
[1:01:04] by the life that was in him is sent back
[1:01:07] upon the believer
[1:01:08] and that's what satan can't stand
[1:01:10] because he can't defeat christ and he
[1:01:11] knows if you've got christ in you
[1:01:13] he can't defeat you he said it's sent
[1:01:16] back upon the believer as a token a
[1:01:18] memorial that the death has passed from
[1:01:20] it
[1:01:20] and that god has sealed you into the
[1:01:22] kingdom of god until the day of your
[1:01:24] redemption he says
[1:01:25] ephesians 4 30. so we see that once
[1:01:27] we're sealed into the day of redemption
[1:01:29] no one can break that seal not even god
[1:01:31] is that right
[1:01:33] amen are you thankful for the spirit of
[1:01:35] the lord this evening amen i promise i
[1:01:38] won't hold you very much longer but
[1:01:40] just kind of want to get through this
[1:01:41] tonight and kind of go and just
[1:01:43] kind of you know it's nothing new i know
[1:01:45] it's nothing you haven't heard before i
[1:01:46] know it's something that you've been
[1:01:47] taught on
[1:01:48] but i think it's something we should
[1:01:49] revisit it was laid upon my heart so i
[1:01:51] pray that god will just
[1:01:52] maybe just inspire you by this and maybe
[1:01:54] do something good in your life
[1:01:56] and romans 5 and verse 19 if we can go
[1:01:59] there and
[1:02:01] just look at that here sister joanna if
[1:02:03] we could i'll just kind of break down
[1:02:04] the scripture
[1:02:06] and go through it
[1:02:09] so romans 5 and verse 19 for as by one
[1:02:12] man's disobedience
[1:02:13] many were made sinners so by the
[1:02:16] obedience of one
[1:02:17] shall many be made righteous so we see
[1:02:20] that when
[1:02:20] when the fall took place in the garden
[1:02:23] all mankind was
[1:02:24] cast out is that right there was no more
[1:02:27] direct connection with god
[1:02:29] there was a there was a barrier put up
[1:02:31] that we had to find a way and man began
[1:02:33] searching immediately
[1:02:34] to get back to god and and abel had come
[1:02:37] to the revelation of what
[1:02:38] god had done in the garden for adam and
[1:02:40] eve by when they covered themselves with
[1:02:42] fig leaves
[1:02:43] when they made their own homemade
[1:02:44] religion as brother branham says god
[1:02:46] come down and sacrificed
[1:02:48] through death so that they might live is
[1:02:50] that right so we see that for by one
[1:02:52] man's disobedience many were made
[1:02:54] sinners so by the obedience of one shall
[1:02:56] many be made righteous not that we're
[1:02:58] righteous within ourselves
[1:02:59] but that we take on the righteousness of
[1:03:01] jesus christ in verse 20
[1:03:03] moreover the law entered that the
[1:03:04] offense might abound
[1:03:06] so what that is saying is once the law
[1:03:08] entered there were more offenses
[1:03:11] because without law there's no offenses
[1:03:13] is that right if there was no speed
[1:03:14] limit
[1:03:15] i could not get a speeding ticket is
[1:03:17] that right
[1:03:18] and now this is where a lot of people
[1:03:19] come into legalism and and grace because
[1:03:21] they say well
[1:03:22] if you preach this then nobody will live
[1:03:25] right but
[1:03:25] i always go back to if they're not in
[1:03:28] christ they can live legalistic
[1:03:30] and still not make it so you've gotta
[1:03:32] you know you can have legalism
[1:03:33] and still fall you can have greasy grace
[1:03:36] and still fall but if you have christ
[1:03:38] you'll never fall is that right
[1:03:40] so we see that that but where sin
[1:03:42] abounded
[1:03:43] grace did much more abound now i love
[1:03:46] this because
[1:03:47] the scripture says you know god's grace
[1:03:50] is sufficient
[1:03:51] and i began to study that scripture a
[1:03:52] long time ago and i preached on it a
[1:03:54] little bit ago and
[1:03:54] and i looked at the word sufficient and
[1:03:56] it just means just enough
[1:03:58] and when i think of god i don't think of
[1:04:00] just enough i think of more than enough
[1:04:03] overwhelmingly enough but when you look
[1:04:05] at grace
[1:04:06] that's why it says grace is sufficient
[1:04:08] because it's not greasy grace he's not
[1:04:09] just throwing out grace so that you can
[1:04:11] go live
[1:04:11] any way you want to he knew you from the
[1:04:13] beginning he knew what you would do
[1:04:15] he knew what you would choose and
[1:04:17] through predestination knew that you
[1:04:18] would choose him
[1:04:19] and so we see that when his grace is
[1:04:21] sufficient it covers
[1:04:22] your sin is that right it's not out
[1:04:24] there just covering any sin that's not
[1:04:26] out there just pouring around and it's
[1:04:27] just grace for everyone grace for
[1:04:29] everyone
[1:04:30] it has to be grace that you've been
[1:04:31] identified with your sacrifice to
[1:04:33] receive
[1:04:34] that grace so we see that grace did much
[1:04:37] more abound in verse 21
[1:04:38] that as sin hath reigned unto death even
[1:04:41] so might
[1:04:42] grace reign through righteousness unto
[1:04:44] eternal life by jesus christ our lord so
[1:04:47] where
[1:04:48] before sin had reigned unto death saying
[1:04:51] that that sin had cast us out to wear
[1:04:52] eternal life where adam and eve could
[1:04:54] have lived eternally in the garden
[1:04:56] when they were cast out then they begin
[1:04:57] to die from that moment forward mankind
[1:04:59] was born and then they would die
[1:05:01] born and die and so we see that once
[1:05:04] that grace come
[1:05:05] through the righteousness unto eternal
[1:05:07] life by jesus christ our lord
[1:05:09] and that was him being dying going to
[1:05:11] hell and raising again defeating death
[1:05:13] hell in the grave
[1:05:14] and that someday you and i will take a
[1:05:16] rapture just like enoch is that right
[1:05:18] we'll be here one day and then all of a
[1:05:20] sudden we'll be gone is that right
[1:05:22] so we see that that's not any that's not
[1:05:24] greasy grace that's the perfect grace of
[1:05:26] jesus christ now
[1:05:27] brother branham says he says and he's
[1:05:29] preaching and what is the holy ghost and
[1:05:30] i've seen this and i just love it he
[1:05:32] said there's never been
[1:05:32] anything on earth yet that would ever
[1:05:34] defeat satan like the word of god
[1:05:37] you can take a preacher and he can
[1:05:38] preach that won't defeat it you can take
[1:05:40] a singer and they can sing that won't
[1:05:41] defeat it but the word of god
[1:05:43] will defeat satan every time in every
[1:05:46] condition in every circumstance do you
[1:05:47] believe that
[1:05:50] amen whenever this grace come whenever
[1:05:52] jesus whenever this sacrifice hit it was
[1:05:54] something the devil had never seen
[1:05:55] before because there was still a
[1:05:56] remembrance of sin
[1:05:58] but once christ come that believer was
[1:06:00] separated from that sin and was given
[1:06:02] the righteousness
[1:06:03] of jesus christ and so if we could now
[1:06:06] we'll go to romans chapter 8 and verse 1
[1:06:08] and
[1:06:08] kind of go down through this scripture
[1:06:10] here just for a few moments
[1:06:15] amen do you love the lord this evening
[1:06:18] you know that's another thing and i just
[1:06:19] break it up just while she gets those
[1:06:21] scriptures we'll go down
[1:06:22] all the way to verse 11 but you know
[1:06:25] i never realized how hard it was as a
[1:06:27] parent
[1:06:28] how to get anything out of church you
[1:06:29] know i feel like you know for the last
[1:06:31] five or six years it's just been you've
[1:06:33] been just getting little nuggets and
[1:06:34] little bits and pieces and
[1:06:36] you know i remember i would just being
[1:06:37] able to study i would come home and
[1:06:40] and i feel so guilty now working and
[1:06:41] having a family and then trying to study
[1:06:43] and
[1:06:44] used to i just had loads of time to
[1:06:45] study and just could sit back in my
[1:06:47] recliner and you know
[1:06:48] i get home today and popper's pulling
[1:06:50] the plug out of the
[1:06:51] computer hitting power and just doing
[1:06:53] all these things and
[1:06:54] and you know it's it's just the way life
[1:06:56] is is that right but that doesn't mean
[1:06:57] we should give up
[1:06:58] you know i could have took the bad
[1:07:00] attitude which i've done before
[1:07:02] probably last week did more than this
[1:07:03] week and i just took the bad attitude
[1:07:05] just like whatever happens happens you
[1:07:06] know
[1:07:07] and the spirit of the lord can't work
[1:07:08] with that right we can't just say well
[1:07:10] whatever happens happens we've got to
[1:07:12] come
[1:07:12] and be like-minded with christ is that
[1:07:14] right
[1:07:15] now romans 8 1 says there is therefore
[1:07:17] now no condemnation to them that believe
[1:07:20] which are in christ jesus who walk not
[1:07:22] after the flesh but after the spirit
[1:07:24] so there's no condemnation to them that
[1:07:26] believe that are in christ
[1:07:28] jesus who walk not after the flesh but
[1:07:30] after the spirit so that means we're
[1:07:32] walking
[1:07:32] after the spirit of christ which means
[1:07:34] we're not walking after the things the
[1:07:36] flesh wants we're not walking after the
[1:07:38] things that
[1:07:39] that the world is desiring but we're
[1:07:41] walking in the spirit of jesus christ
[1:07:43] and
[1:07:44] romans 8 2 again for the law the spirit
[1:07:46] of life in christ jesus had made me free
[1:07:48] from the law of sin and death
[1:07:50] for what the law could not do is weak
[1:07:52] through the flesh god sending his own
[1:07:53] son
[1:07:54] in likeness of sinful flesh for sin
[1:07:56] condemned sin in the flesh
[1:07:58] and i know i've read this through but i
[1:07:59] want to read it again that the
[1:08:01] righteousness of the law might be
[1:08:02] fulfilled in
[1:08:03] us who walk not after the flesh but
[1:08:05] after the spirit
[1:08:06] so we see that the righteousness of the
[1:08:08] law had to be fulfilled but who did it
[1:08:10] have to be fulfilled in
[1:08:11] you and i so we walk not after the flesh
[1:08:14] but after the spirit he says for they
[1:08:15] that are after the flesh do mind the
[1:08:17] things of the flesh
[1:08:18] but they that are after the spirit the
[1:08:20] things of the spirit
[1:08:21] now you can get around somebody and
[1:08:24] begin to talk
[1:08:25] and you can realize very quickly if
[1:08:27] you're if you're attentive
[1:08:28] that what that person is interested in
[1:08:31] you know i can i can go up and meet
[1:08:32] somebody new and if i get to talking to
[1:08:34] them and i'm not really
[1:08:36] being the one that's talking i'm just
[1:08:37] asking them about themselves you can
[1:08:39] find real quick what's important to a
[1:08:40] person
[1:08:41] is that right um and so we look here and
[1:08:45] and you know if you if you go up to
[1:08:47] somebody that's maybe um
[1:08:49] they like sports you know i set by a guy
[1:08:51] today and he was wanting to talk sports
[1:08:52] to me i don't watch sports i could care
[1:08:54] less
[1:08:55] and i was like i really wish i could
[1:08:57] talk to you about it but i can't
[1:08:59] you know now if he wanted to talk
[1:09:00] hunting and fishing i could sit there
[1:09:01] all day right
[1:09:02] and so we see that that's not that
[1:09:04] hunting and fishing is better and sports
[1:09:05] are worse or this is the flesh and this
[1:09:07] is not the flesh
[1:09:08] but you can find what a person likes if
[1:09:10] you just listen to them just for a
[1:09:12] moment
[1:09:12] and if we're not careful as christians
[1:09:14] we can get caught up in those things
[1:09:16] that we genuinely like that are not sin
[1:09:18] is that right like i love to you know i
[1:09:20] love to budget i love to look at
[1:09:21] finances i love to be in the outdoors i
[1:09:23] love to do those things and i can get
[1:09:24] caught up
[1:09:25] doing those things and not focusing on
[1:09:28] really what i need to be which is the
[1:09:29] word of god
[1:09:30] now we see here if we go on down i
[1:09:33] believe in verse 5
[1:09:34] yeah and so we see that for they that
[1:09:36] are after the flesh do mind the things
[1:09:37] of the flesh but they that are after the
[1:09:39] spirit the things of the spirit
[1:09:40] so we never want to get to where we're
[1:09:42] so spiritual that we can't talk to one
[1:09:44] another is that right
[1:09:45] you know you say well how was your day
[1:09:46] and they just you know they start you
[1:09:48] know quoting scripture to you
[1:09:49] it's very hard to communicate with that
[1:09:50] type of person but we ought to be
[1:09:52] spiritually minded is that right now
[1:09:56] verse six for to be carnally minded as
[1:09:57] death but to be spiritually minded is
[1:09:59] life and peace
[1:10:00] but the carnal mind is enmity against
[1:10:02] god for it is subject to the law of god
[1:10:04] neither indeed can be
[1:10:07] so then they that are in the flesh
[1:10:08] cannot please god but ye are not in the
[1:10:11] flesh but in the spirit if so be that
[1:10:12] the spirit of god dwell in you so
[1:10:15] if the spirit of god dwell in you then
[1:10:17] you please
[1:10:18] god he says now if any man have not the
[1:10:21] spirit of christ
[1:10:22] he is none of his and if christ being
[1:10:23] you the body is dead because of sin
[1:10:25] and the spirit is the li is life because
[1:10:28] of righteousness
[1:10:29] but if the spirit of him that raised
[1:10:31] jesus from the dead dwell in you he that
[1:10:33] raised christ from the dead shall
[1:10:34] quicken
[1:10:35] your mortal bodies by his spirit that
[1:10:38] dwell in you
[1:10:39] so how will he quicken your mortal
[1:10:41] bodies by his spirit
[1:10:43] is that right so it's got to be the same
[1:10:45] spirit that christ had
[1:10:47] that's the only way we're going to make
[1:10:48] a rapture is if we have that same spirit
[1:10:50] if you have a different spirit the same
[1:10:51] spirit that raised christ from the dead
[1:10:53] is not going to contact your spirit
[1:10:55] it's going to contact the same one that
[1:10:56] had already raised from the dead so that
[1:10:58] you and i can take a rapture do you
[1:10:59] believe that
[1:11:00] brother braham says in 65 and the easter
[1:11:02] seal he says my redeemer is living now
[1:11:04] and then he said and someday when he
[1:11:06] comes these bones shall rise again to go
[1:11:09] meet him in the air
[1:11:10] he said you may bury me in the sea burn
[1:11:12] it up whatever you want to do that
[1:11:13] quickening power is eternal he says whoo
[1:11:15] i feel like easter right now
[1:11:17] he says yes sir i've had it for years
[1:11:19] it's in me
[1:11:20] he says it's in you and he says if you
[1:11:22] that the spirit the race jesus from the
[1:11:24] dead dwells in your mortal bodies it
[1:11:26] will quicken you
[1:11:27] from the things of the world to the word
[1:11:29] of god
[1:11:30] only not to a church not to a dogma not
[1:11:32] to a creed but it will quicken you to
[1:11:34] the word of god
[1:11:35] only it's quickened you from this life
[1:11:37] to life eternal
[1:11:38] you who were once dead in sin and
[1:11:40] trespass has now been quickened together
[1:11:43] set in heavenly places with christ jesus
[1:11:46] feasting on manna from above
[1:11:48] seeing the hand of god made manifest
[1:11:50] prove the promise
[1:11:51] of this day are you thankful for that he
[1:11:54] says what is it the quickening power he
[1:11:55] says coming to the church making her
[1:11:57] ready
[1:11:57] he said this hour that we're approaching
[1:12:00] quickening power he says oh god help us
[1:12:01] to receive it
[1:12:03] help us to believe it see it just
[1:12:04] depends on what attitude you take
[1:12:06] whether it's going to do you any good or
[1:12:08] not he says though he says see you have
[1:12:10] to believe it
[1:12:11] you don't have to believe it he says it
[1:12:12] won't do you any bit of good
[1:12:14] and i really want to focus on that just
[1:12:17] for a moment if i could it says it just
[1:12:18] depends on which attitude you take
[1:12:21] so you know you can go to uh you can go
[1:12:24] to talk to your wife and if you have a
[1:12:26] bad attitude i can guarantee that
[1:12:27] conversation is going to go bad if you
[1:12:29] go to a co-worker with a bad attitude
[1:12:30] that conversation is going to go bad
[1:12:32] if you come to church with a bad
[1:12:34] attitude that service is not going to do
[1:12:36] you any good
[1:12:37] it may not affect the rest of us if it
[1:12:39] does you really need to calm down the
[1:12:41] attitude a little bit if it's affecting
[1:12:43] everybody else around you
[1:12:44] but it will affect how you receive the
[1:12:46] word of god if you come to church
[1:12:48] in the wrong spirit and the wrong motive
[1:12:50] or for the wrong objective you're not
[1:12:52] going to receive
[1:12:53] what god has called the minister to do
[1:12:54] which is to preach the word of god
[1:12:56] and as believers we ought to come
[1:12:58] like-minded with christ is that right
[1:13:02] how many of you know jesus was
[1:13:03] considered a radical in his day i i love
[1:13:05] it because he wasn't in the
[1:13:06] he wasn't in the church saying come to
[1:13:08] me but he was out talking to the
[1:13:09] prostitutes
[1:13:10] he was out talking to the drunkards he
[1:13:12] was out talking to the accountants the
[1:13:13] tax collectors
[1:13:14] he was out doing these things he wasn't
[1:13:17] in the church saying well you've got to
[1:13:18] come to me you've got to come do this
[1:13:19] but we see that jesus
[1:13:21] was going anywhere that he would be
[1:13:22] accepted is that right and we see that
[1:13:24] the priests the churches of that time
[1:13:26] didn't have the attitude to accept him
[1:13:28] so he went where he was accepted so if
[1:13:31] you come to the church
[1:13:32] tonight with the wrong attitude you
[1:13:34] can't be identified with that sacrifice
[1:13:35] you can't expect to get anything
[1:13:37] out of the service if you come with the
[1:13:39] wrong attitude do you believe that
[1:13:44] amen just a few more minutes here and
[1:13:45] we'll kind of bring this down to a close
[1:13:47] and
[1:13:50] he says how did samuel stood there
[1:13:52] before the people and said have i ever
[1:13:53] told you anything
[1:13:54] and this is when they were wanting a
[1:13:56] king and we see that samuel was the
[1:13:58] prophet and the people begin to come to
[1:14:00] him and say well they have a king we
[1:14:01] want a king
[1:14:02] and he says have i ever told you
[1:14:04] anything in the name of the lord but
[1:14:05] what happened he said did i ever
[1:14:06] beg for your money to live on they said
[1:14:09] no but we want a king anyhow.
[1:14:11] he said that's the way the church is
[1:14:13] today they want their i own ideas
[1:14:15] they won't pay a bit of attention to you
[1:14:17] the walk right around well
[1:14:19] it just goes to show that the quickening
[1:14:21] power is not there
[1:14:22] he says oh i say you say i spoke in
[1:14:24] tongues i jumped and shouted he said
[1:14:26] that's all fine but when that if that
[1:14:27] quicken and power is there you'll
[1:14:29] recognize
[1:14:30] like that little eagle he said that's
[1:14:32] his mom and that's the word and he says
[1:14:34] that's thus saith the lord and that's
[1:14:35] what god promised he says
[1:14:37] that's what was foretold and that's what
[1:14:39] is exactly what was happened
[1:14:41] he said we're beyond any shadow of a
[1:14:43] doubt potentially in the resurrection
[1:14:45] right now
[1:14:46] the saints getting ready to be taken up
[1:14:48] in the air i love that potentially in
[1:14:49] the resurrection right now the saints
[1:14:51] getting ready to be taken up
[1:14:53] in the air do you believe that tonight
[1:14:55] he said so jesus so full of this
[1:14:57] quickening power said if you can destroy
[1:14:58] this temple
[1:14:59] he says it took you 40 years to build he
[1:15:01] says you thought he said i'll raise it
[1:15:03] up in three days he said why
[1:15:05] could jesus say that he said i want to
[1:15:07] ask you he says why could jesus say a
[1:15:08] thing like that he says he knew
[1:15:10] what he was he said amen i wish i could
[1:15:12] make that stick he knew who he was and
[1:15:14] he knew that
[1:15:15] every word that god had ever wrote in
[1:15:17] there of him he had fulfilled it
[1:15:19] he knew he was the one that david spoke
[1:15:21] of he says do you know that you're the
[1:15:22] ones the bible speaks of
[1:15:24] their congregation said amen we got one
[1:15:26] yes so we got one on board tonight
[1:15:29] i'll take one that's more than zero so
[1:15:31] that's an accounting term i know it's
[1:15:32] technical but one is more than zero so
[1:15:35] he says do you know your position in
[1:15:36] christ he says if you're in christ
[1:15:38] you're a new creature
[1:15:39] do you know this word is just like every
[1:15:42] day living to you
[1:15:43] i love that do you know that this word
[1:15:46] is just like
[1:15:46] everyday living to you he says why sure
[1:15:49] it's yours he says you're an eagle
[1:15:51] that's your food and so we see as
[1:15:53] believers this just becomes natural to
[1:15:55] us that whenever we come up
[1:15:56] against an obstacle we just ask god to
[1:15:59] help us and what does he do he comes in
[1:16:01] and helps us he makes a way
[1:16:02] because that's just who we are we're
[1:16:04] eagles that's our food do you believe
[1:16:06] that amen do you love the lord this
[1:16:08] evening
[1:16:09] i went through and i pulled some figures
[1:16:10] in it and i just kind of
[1:16:12] estimated just based off of this website
[1:16:14] and i may be totally off because
[1:16:16] you can't believe everything that's on
[1:16:18] the internet unfortunately but
[1:16:20] um the last calculations as of a few
[1:16:22] years ago that was there an estimated
[1:16:24] total of about a hundred and billion 108
[1:16:27] billion people have lived
[1:16:29] over the space of history throughout all
[1:16:32] time
[1:16:33] i believe there's around seven and a
[1:16:34] half billion or so on the earth right
[1:16:36] now
[1:16:37] but from the beginning of time from what
[1:16:39] they consider um
[1:16:41] the first humans on the earth there's
[1:16:43] been around 108 billion come
[1:16:44] through the earth so that's a lot right
[1:16:48] you know that that's a lot of people you
[1:16:50] look at how many people are on the earth
[1:16:52] and
[1:16:52] every time i go into you know i like
[1:16:54] living in the middle of nowhere because
[1:16:55] i'm
[1:16:56] as i said earlier i like to get in my
[1:16:58] own little bubble and work
[1:17:00] when i get around a lot of people i'm
[1:17:01] very sociable i like to talk to people
[1:17:03] but i
[1:17:03] i have i have enough when i've had
[1:17:05] enough right
[1:17:08] and some people are that way some people
[1:17:09] just they they go to when they want to
[1:17:11] recharge they go to a group of people to
[1:17:13] recharge
[1:17:14] i go away from people to recharge so and
[1:17:16] there's opposites there's not a bad it's
[1:17:18] not bad that i do that and it's not bad
[1:17:19] that people go to people and do that
[1:17:21] but there's a lot of people that has
[1:17:22] come through the earth but there's only
[1:17:23] one that come by a virgin birth is that
[1:17:25] right
[1:17:26] there's only one out of 107 billion that
[1:17:28] ever rose from the dead and ascended on
[1:17:30] high there's only one and if that same
[1:17:32] spirit
[1:17:33] that dwelt in him that raised him from
[1:17:35] the dead dwells in you it will raise and
[1:17:37] quicken our mortal bodies is that right
[1:17:39] romans 8 11 again by his spirit that
[1:17:41] dwelleth in you
[1:17:42] that's the only way our mortal bodies
[1:17:44] will be quicken is by his spirit
[1:17:46] it's not our spirit it's not brother
[1:17:48] ben's spirit it's not the song leader
[1:17:49] spirit it's by
[1:17:50] the spirit of jesus christ living on the
[1:17:53] inside of you and i
[1:17:54] we have everything that we need to take
[1:17:57] a rapture inside of us do you believe
[1:17:58] that
[1:17:59] everything that we need to take a
[1:18:00] rapture if you're filled with the holy
[1:18:02] ghost everything that you need to make
[1:18:03] that rapture
[1:18:04] is already in you but we're waiting to
[1:18:06] that appointed time is that right
[1:18:09] amen we've got to get closer to god just
[1:18:10] like enoch one day we will be and then
[1:18:12] the next day we'll be a little higher is
[1:18:14] that right
[1:18:16] no brother branham says in the easter
[1:18:17] seal and i'll just bring this to a close
[1:18:19] just in a few minutes i've said that a
[1:18:20] lot but about five more minutes and i
[1:18:21] promise it's gonna happen
[1:18:23] the easter seal in 65 remember there's
[1:18:25] only one hope
[1:18:26] he said get this quickening power and
[1:18:28] it'll hold you when everything else says
[1:18:30] give away it'll hold you he says some of
[1:18:32] them said
[1:18:32] did you keep your religion brother
[1:18:34] branham he said no it kept me
[1:18:36] he said it keeps me he says no i didn't
[1:18:38] keep it any whether i hold on or not
[1:18:40] it's whether he held on or not
[1:18:42] he is what held on for me and amen
[1:18:45] don't you believe that when you don't
[1:18:46] have enough strength to hang on he hangs
[1:18:48] on to you is that right
[1:18:49] he didn't have to angels was said and
[1:18:51] every tree said just pull your finger
[1:18:53] loose
[1:18:54] just point you don't have to take it
[1:18:56] from this cross just point your finger
[1:18:57] and watch what he said see
[1:18:59] that mocking bunch but if he had did
[1:19:01] that i couldn't have this testimony
[1:19:04] today
[1:19:04] you couldn't have the testimony today he
[1:19:07] said but because he stayed to the cross
[1:19:09] he held there
[1:19:10] and that's why i hold to him because he
[1:19:13] holds to me
[1:19:14] do you love the lord this evening and so
[1:19:17] remember adam had a conditional covenant
[1:19:19] do not eat
[1:19:20] samson had a conditional covenant do not
[1:19:22] cut your hair and you'll have this
[1:19:23] strength and
[1:19:24] and this but abraham what did he give an
[1:19:27] unconditional covenant
[1:19:28] is that right and i love how brother
[1:19:30] josh he kind of dealt on it that's what
[1:19:31] i was going to speak on tonight was
[1:19:32] was the same promise but the same
[1:19:34] promise that unconditional covenant was
[1:19:36] given to abraham
[1:19:37] that we would he would possess wherever
[1:19:38] his foot went he would possess that that
[1:19:40] was given to you and i
[1:19:41] as well is that right because we are the
[1:19:43] spiritual seed of abraham
[1:19:45] so the same spirit that made christ
[1:19:47] overcome is the same spirit on you and i
[1:19:49] that's overcoming in laodicea do you
[1:19:51] believe that
[1:19:53] amen do you love the lord this evening
[1:19:55] amen if the musicians would go ahead and
[1:19:56] come we'll go ahead and just
[1:19:57] just kind of close this down and
[1:20:00] god's provided place of worship and i
[1:20:02] think it's very important to figure out
[1:20:06] how to be identified with your sacrifice
[1:20:08] because it's to be identified with
[1:20:10] christ
[1:20:11] you can't be identified with your own
[1:20:13] will or your you can't be identified
[1:20:15] with your church you can't go up and say
[1:20:16] well
[1:20:17] you know i'm with word of life
[1:20:18] tabernacle and and i'm identified in
[1:20:20] that no you've got to be identified in
[1:20:22] jesus christ is that right
[1:20:25] he said now in 65 he said god's provided
[1:20:27] place of worship
[1:20:30] he says now we find out this old fellow
[1:20:32] being a prophet he had cursed that thing
[1:20:34] and everything stayed perfectly with the
[1:20:36] will of god and when all the rest of the
[1:20:38] preachers
[1:20:38] weakened off he stayed right there with
[1:20:40] him and one day he got so tired god sent
[1:20:43] a chariot down from heaven
[1:20:44] horses of fire and took him up he was so
[1:20:46] full of the quickening power he says
[1:20:48] just think
[1:20:48] with the word of god in his heart he
[1:20:50] becomes so full of that quickening power
[1:20:52] that it quickened him
[1:20:53] he said if the spirit of god he said i
[1:20:55] believe we find in romans 11 or 1 or
[1:20:57] he says it says if the spirit
[1:21:00] if the spirit that raised jesus from the
[1:21:02] dead be in you it will also quicken your
[1:21:04] mortal bodies and if the spirit that
[1:21:05] raised jesus from the dead
[1:21:07] if it be in you it will also quicken
[1:21:09] your mortal bodies has quickened it
[1:21:11] he said what does the word quick mean he
[1:21:13] said the word
[1:21:14] the greek word means to be brought to
[1:21:16] life after death
[1:21:18] he says hallelujah he says there's the
[1:21:20] gate of worship
[1:21:22] worshiping in the spirit and in truth
[1:21:24] mechanics
[1:21:25] and dynamics together you know there's a
[1:21:28] lot of churches that out there that can
[1:21:29] just have
[1:21:30] amazing worship services and you can
[1:21:32] even you know i've went to some
[1:21:33] denominational churches and you can get
[1:21:34] in the spirit of worship
[1:21:36] you can feel it whenever they start to
[1:21:38] sing and they've got just musicians that
[1:21:40] are amazing and they've got
[1:21:42] the lights dim and they just got the
[1:21:43] atmosphere and you can get in that
[1:21:45] spirit of worship
[1:21:47] but it doesn't do no good if you don't
[1:21:48] have the mechanics and the dynamics to
[1:21:50] put it together you've got to be
[1:21:51] worshiping
[1:21:52] in that right spirit he says you see
[1:21:54] what i mean if the spirit that raised
[1:21:55] jesus from the dead dwells in you it
[1:21:56] will quicken
[1:21:58] make alive your mortal bodies because
[1:22:01] it's already life
[1:22:02] he says and when it comes into your body
[1:22:04] it brings your whole body
[1:22:05] subject to it he says subject to what
[1:22:09] the word of god he says if it's in me
[1:22:12] so we see that that spirit of god is not
[1:22:13] going to bring a subject to a man
[1:22:16] it's not gonna be bring a subject to an
[1:22:18] idea or a dogma or a theme
[1:22:21] but it's gonna be bring a subject to the
[1:22:23] word of god
[1:22:24] so if you have any spirit that's not
[1:22:25] bringing you subject to the word of god
[1:22:27] you know it's the wrong spirit
[1:22:28] because the spirit of christ will always
[1:22:31] reflect
[1:22:32] in our life as christ was in his day is
[1:22:35] that right
[1:22:37] now we know that it's a different time
[1:22:38] it's a different age different things
[1:22:40] are happening but he was tempted just
[1:22:42] like you and i
[1:22:43] everything that we go through he has
[1:22:45] been tempted in the same manner
[1:22:46] and we see that life of christ if it
[1:22:48] overcome then it will overcome now
[1:22:50] do you believe that amen and i'll just
[1:22:53] read this last quote here thank you
[1:22:55] man's filter in 1965 he says i go to
[1:22:57] this church
[1:22:57] if you just want to play something
[1:22:58] softly says they don't never name it
[1:23:01] that thing
[1:23:02] they don't say nothing about this
[1:23:03] nothing about that none of these things
[1:23:05] are brought up our preacher
[1:23:06] is more wide-minded than that we don't
[1:23:09] say things like that or what is it
[1:23:11] he says you've got the taste of the
[1:23:12] world and you're sucking for it just
[1:23:14] right he says
[1:23:15] but a thinking woman won't take that
[1:23:17] kind of thing she knows she's got to be
[1:23:19] holy
[1:23:20] and the only thing that you can draw
[1:23:22] through god's word is the spirit
[1:23:24] the quickening power to make the word
[1:23:26] itself
[1:23:27] which is in you live to manifest jesus
[1:23:30] christ
[1:23:31] in the age you're living i want to read
[1:23:33] that again the quickening power
[1:23:36] to make the word itself which is in you
[1:23:39] live to manifest jesus christ in the age
[1:23:42] you're living
[1:23:43] so that spirit will manifest the life of
[1:23:46] jesus christ
[1:23:48] through you in laodicea says hallelujah
[1:23:51] brother he says
[1:23:52] if that ain't the truth i don't know
[1:23:54] what the truth is he said i've lost my
[1:23:55] mind if that isn't the truth
[1:23:58] is the word itself in your heart
[1:24:00] predestinated there that's drawing
[1:24:03] and it spits out that world and it don't
[1:24:06] want it
[1:24:06] but when it gets over here in the word
[1:24:08] it begins to draw
[1:24:10] and when it draws through the word it
[1:24:12] can be nothing else but the holy ghost
[1:24:14] to quicken that word so we see that if
[1:24:18] we want the life of jesus christ to live
[1:24:20] in this day
[1:24:22] we've got to have the same spirit that
[1:24:23] raised him from the dead
[1:24:26] in you and i in this day do you believe
[1:24:28] that
[1:24:29] amen why don't we just bow our heads
[1:24:31] just for a few moments as we pray to
[1:24:32] close out the service
[1:24:36] lord we just thank you for coming and
[1:24:37] speaking to us tonight lord just
[1:24:39] maybe just a little sunday school lesson
[1:24:42] god it's just what you laid on my heart
[1:24:44] but
[1:24:44] i believe as believers we can
[1:24:47] or maybe there's somebody here tonight
[1:24:49] that you know that's only gone
[1:24:51] so far that they can say well i've done
[1:24:53] this and i've done that and i've done
[1:24:54] this and i've done that but
[1:24:56] for some reason the life of christ is
[1:24:58] just not manifesting in my life like i
[1:25:00] want it to
[1:25:02] so maybe tonight they'll come to the
[1:25:03] realization that maybe they don't have
[1:25:05] what they've always said they had
[1:25:08] because in this day we don't want to
[1:25:09] point out lord that's not our goal or
[1:25:12] ambition to point out
[1:25:13] faults and say well this one doesn't
[1:25:14] have it or this one doesn't have it but
[1:25:16] we want to have the heart that christ
[1:25:17] had to say that if anyone doesn't have
[1:25:19] it we want them to get it
[1:25:21] but as believers in this day it should
[1:25:23] be our desire to see more souls saved
[1:25:26] lord it should be the desire to see
[1:25:28] people fall away or this one disbelieve
[1:25:30] but lord we should be desiring daily to
[1:25:33] see more come to you
[1:25:36] as we should live our lives as examples
[1:25:38] that when people see us they should see
[1:25:40] christ
[1:25:42] god i pray for the believers here
[1:25:43] tonight lord they they made a special
[1:25:45] effort just to come out and hear from
[1:25:47] you
[1:25:48] but i pray that the word would not
[1:25:49] return unto you void but it would go
[1:25:51] out it would accomplish that what you
[1:25:53] sent it to do
[1:25:55] i pray you just bless us tonight lord
[1:25:58] for the service coming up sunday i pray
[1:26:00] just anoint
[1:26:00] our brother stewart lord just move upon
[1:26:02] him let me just come speak
[1:26:04] great and mighty things to us lord that
[1:26:06] what we'd have need of you would bring
[1:26:08] it to us
[1:26:10] we just pray to continue for our pastor
[1:26:12] give him rest grant him peace
[1:26:15] and come back just be able to stand the
[1:26:17] line of duty again
