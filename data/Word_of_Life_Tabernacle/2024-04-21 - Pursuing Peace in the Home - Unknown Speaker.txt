that you'd do it now Lord move me out of the way speak through me today Lord I I I need your help Lord I'm desperate for you I pray you to help me today and help these people we pray in Jesus name amen amen thank the Lord let's go to Romans chapter 14 and verse 19 also read from Psalms 34 Verse 14 Romans 14 19 and Psalms 3414 Romans 14:19 said let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace I want to reread that because it's very important let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace and things wherewith one may edify another and then Psalms 34:14 says depart from Evil and do good seek peace and pursue it the Lord would that his Blessing to the word you may be seated this morning Paul says follow pursue is what that word means it actually means to pursue or persecute a person who would persecute another would mean they were following them they were would not leave them alone he said pursue those things which make for peace David says seek peace peace pursue peace Paul is telling the church he said don't I don't want you to argue about meats and that's what chapter 14 uh much of it is about Romans that I want you to argue over whether we should eat this meat or that meat or or things like that he said that's nothing he said I want you to follow things I want you to pursue things that make for peace in the church and and that don't cause conflict I want you to pursue the ingredients if we could put it that way of Peace in the church so you know a lot of people want peace and I've heard peace described it there was a a king that uh commissioned a a painter to paint a picture of peace and different painters had had painted uh beautiful landscapes and Still Waters and and uh and and pastures of idic scenes and and then one painter he painted a storm and and he painted a a waterfall and everything's gray and cloudy and the wind's blowing but in the Cliff of the rock there by the waterfall is a little bird and a little nest and it's shielded from the storm and it's at peace in the middle of storm so peace is not the absence of trouble but it's actually peace in the storm or as Paul puts it peace that passes understanding peace that passes understanding peace is to set at one again that which was separate or against itself and so we are made peace that's why Paul says uh peace was brought by the cross we were at odds with God and and we were against him there was a Chasm between us and him and peace is to set that back again Paul tells us I didn't give you the scripture but he said God is not the author of confusion but of peace and he said as in all the churches of the Saints he's not the author of confusion but of peace now if you want peace in the church I want to dig a little bit deeper than the church this morning I want us to look at peace in our homes I want us to look at how we pursue peace in the home because if we pursue peace in our home will'll pursue peace in the church there will be peace in the church and I believe we have peace and I'm so thankful for that so I'm not preaching at you today but I know it's a world of chaos and we we need to understand what it takes the ingredients that it takes to have peace in our homes and I want us to think about the home today and and all day today I want us to think about the home as the space that we live in not necessarily just our physical space but our our mental space our the the the the life that we inhabit your not just necessarily your house but your people uh your family the ones you're responsible for or the ones that are responsible for you it's your routine it's what you do every day it's your your your spouse your children it's your home life it's the way brother brand puts it home life it's the natural state of your relationship in your home and we know that without the word of God we know that the natural state of relationships and homes is chaos it is chaos and it takes the word of God to put it back into bring it back to peace again we find that in Genesis chapter 1 when the Earth was left to its own devices it was without form it was void and darkness was upon the face of the deep but then the spirit of God be to move on the face of the waters and then God be to speak and he said let there be light and it brought order where there was disorder and I want to tell you this morning that the spirit quickened word will bring order to your home the spirit quickened word will bring will bring peace out of chaos it'll bring a home that's according to the word instead of one that's according to the world yeah so there's no order in our homes or in our churches without the spirit quickened word right and I want us to notice this morning brother brandom begins to see a decline in home life what he calls home life in America back in the 50s and when we think about the 50s you think about almost a a time of peace and a time of tranquility and some of you lived through that time and and maybe it was a time when there wasn't a whole lot going on and and and so there was uh an absence of war and and and it was a time when kids could play out on the street and and and and weren't worried about things like we are today though there were there was trouble but not like what we have today and yet brother brandom sees something in that that the world had gotten away from something America in particular had gotten away from some things that they needed uh they needed to stay with they needed to do they had quit uh going they quit putting the ingredients of Peace in their home homes and pretty soon the peace left as well and so he begins to notice that now we know that today it is not a time of Peace it's a time of Chaos in the world how many understand that today the world's in chaos it's completely gone crazy it's gone completely insane brother B said there would come a day when it would be totally insane and we've reached that point the world is completely insane politics don't make sense churches don't make sense the world doesn't make any sense homes don't make any sense the way they order things just it just it's just crazy and who who comes up with that stuff well it's the collective Insanity of the world and brother there come a day that they'll be grouping in insanity and even the smartest people seems like the smarter they are the more insane they are right so that's the world we're living in and statistics show and I want you to understand this today statistics show that your marriage you end up broken your children will become drug addicts or perverts or something else but we are not a statistic today we're not here to just be part of the culture we're not here to be more make more Americans or more Republicans or more Democrats we're here to stand against history we're here we're going to be taken out of this world one of these days and the world's going to judgment I'm not going into tribulation I'm going into Rapture and so I need to stand for truth while we have the ability to stand for truth we as as parents we got to stand for truth as as fathers we got to stand for truth as mothers you got to stand for something and so we're we're getting far that the Gap is getting wider between us and the world but let it get as wide as it wants to get I'm going to stand for the word how about you this morning so we are not a statistic we're not that's why I don't even spend a lot of time talking to you about how bad it is because I want you to know that that's not you you're a Christian you're serving God you're you love the Lord and so that's not you're not a statistic you're you're the Bride of Jesus Christ but we but the reason why we have peace in our homes the reason why we're different is because we have placed the ingredients that God gave us into our homes we've taken the word and done something with it now look we don't have to be a statistic Romans 12:1 says I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service or the least you could do and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God oh I want to prove that in my life don't you what is the will of God for a pastor let me prove it what is the will of God for for a lay member for a husband for a wife let us prove that in the midst of a world of chaos what should we be pursuing to have peace what are the ingredients he said pursue the things which make for peace what should we be pursuing and I think as I begin to look at the message and begin to look what brother BR says about the home life the first thing that I come across was we've got to pursue prayer in our homes I'm not talking about just prayer in the church but prayer in our homes you say well BR brother Ben you you talk about this a lot and and and you know we've heard this before it's nothing new well it probably isn't but I'll say this it'll make make the difference brother BR said how do you get closer to God read your Bible and pray so I think we need to pursue prayer pursue prayer not just have it as an afterthought or something we do for five minutes before a meal or 5 seconds before a meal but something that we intentionally do in our homes that brings PE peace to our homes Psalms 5:1 says give ear to my words oh Lord consider my meditation hearken unto the voice of my cry my king and my God for unto thee will I pray my voice shalt thou hear in the morning I wonder if we can make a a commitment to that today we can say like David my voice shout th hear in the morning you're going to hear me Lord You're going to hear me you're going to hear my voice not just the pastor's voice not just somebody else's not just my wife not just my husband you're going to hear my voice in the morning in the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee and we'll look up now in the in the Bible you say well brother Ben my wife prays the the children pray before they go to school the pastor prays the preachers pray but I want to challenge us men because we tend to be the ones who are the least vocal and but we're supposed to be leaders in our home and we need to be the ones leading the prayer Bo it got quiet when we need to be the ones that are willing to pray that that that lead our homes into a place of prayer you go in the Old Testament you'll find it was always a man who made the sacrifice because he was Priest of the home and and I understand there's all different situations and you may be a widow or or at home alone by yourself and and you have every right to go to the throne of grace just like anybody else does in that situation you you're a child of God you're a daughter of God but if there is a husband in the home and he's a Believer then that believing husband ought to lead his family in prayer and you young people remember that don't be embarrassed if you're embarrassed to pray for your food in school what do you think it's going to be like when you get a home and you got to pray in the home right but you know makes a big difference it's hard you know it's hard to fuss at your wife and then pray for her you know that's right it's hard to get to to to fuss at your children and pray for them and pray with them so you we need to do that we need to be doing it on a daily basis and I we don't have laws or rules about that but you just do it and and God will make a way for you to do that if you have a desire for that it brings peace and stability to the home brother the matter of said it seems like that home life is running out into shallow water now watch he's watching this happen in a time when people other people maybe don't see it but what we have today is a result of what brother Brandon sees happening then yes sir it seems like home life is running under the shallow water used to be in a home that father the head of the house would sit down of a morning and he would speak with his family and they would all take out the old Family Bible and read just a little bit and all gather around the table and have prayer he said you don't see that no more and when the day was done and Ma had the dishes washed and they'd all Gather in and read some more of the Bible and pray before going to bed he said and home life is so neglected till the Bible is laid back till they'd have to hunt for an hour to find one in many homes in America they go to church on Sunday morning for their religion for about 20 minutes and if the pastor takes 30 minutes he's called on the board what is it he said home life is running out I can't say hello in 30 minutes home life is running out you know and and I think we need to you say well brother Ben I don't think there's many things in my home that need changed well maybe not but we need to be changed and we don't pray brother said if you pray for the Lord to change things situations you pray wrong he said you pray to change yourself you pray to change yourself right that's what needs to change is yourself and so you pray because prayer changes you it changes your perspective on life it changes the way you look at one another prayer does that's why we should pray for our enemies right those who would despitefully use us those would be against us pray for them because it doesn't necessarily change them it changes you and how you view them so prayer changes the our our perspective it used to be brother B said that father and mother loved and honored and cherished one another and when she was old and gray and wrinkled up and her poor old face all drawed up and her glasses hanging down over her nose pop loved her just as well as he did when she was young and pretty like the old man said he said my eyesight has gone dim as your beauty has faded so we're just both in the same boat but you know Beauty will fade right man I'm so glad that marriage is more than that but prayer and brother Brown's talking about prayer here it's the same quote prayer changes your perspective to where you can love one another for what you are instead of what you want that person to be or what they used to be but you love them for what they are because you've changed too so it changes your perspective even of your spouse even of your children he said but today I don't mean to be critical but when she gets a little old he just swaps her for a new model it seems to be that way like swapping cars or something let me say this and I got to say these things I'm a pastor a woman should never feel that her husband is going to kick her out because she gained a little weight or or or she's got a few wrinkles she shouldn't have that worry and as husbands we need to we need to reinforce that in our wives we we need to reinforce that uh we need to we need to encourage our wives and make them understand that that that's you know they're just as beautiful today as they were the day we married them right you say brother man who you preaching at myself I I I told you before and it just gets a little bit personal but it makes my wife really embarrassed but but my wife still takes my breath away she still has that capacity it's true and there ought to be that moment and if you reach a place where just it's boring it's just boring you say well we need to go out to the world we need to go to a bar we need to go no you maybe we need to drink alcohol no what you need to do is pray what you need to do is change the way you think about things till your wife becomes beautiful again put your prayer goggles on some of you all know what I mean right why we have notes so we don't say things like that brother Joel but you need to you need to you need to look through eyes that have been anointed by prayer look BR said just something he said it seems like the real family love doesn't exist much more that just something has happened home life is running out we don't have the old American home as we used to have it long years ago this was in 1958 1958 he said but brother Ben I'm elected I don't need to pray I'm a Child of God okay you believe Jesus was the elect Son of God in fact he did no sin he was altogether lovely completely perfect sinless and he is our example in prayer he prayed more there's more examples of Jesus praying than any other character in The Bible he's our example in prayer he prayed at the beginning of the day in the middle of the day at the end of the day in Mark 135 in the morning rising up a great while before day that's the the commentator say it's about 4:00 in the morning I don't know if that's true but that's early says a great while before day he went out and departed into a solitary place and there prayed Mark 6:46 when he had sent them away he departed into a mountain to pray in the middle of the day and at night geane in the darkest moment of his life they come to a PL place which was named Gethsemane and he said to his disciples sit here while I shall pray brother Brandon was watching the breakdown of the home where people were too busy to pray he said Papa as a key to the house Mama has a key and they're both out and gone half the night the children don't know where they are and little ones are with the babysitter and that's the way life is lived he said do you know the Bible predicts all these things he said so what is it then it's that we're standing in a position watching these things run out watching these things run out now prayer again brings our body subject to the word listen even Jesus that's the way he prayed in Luke 22:40 he said when he was at the place he said to them pray that you enter not into temptation verse 41 and he was withdrawn from them by the Stones cast and kneel down and prayed saying father if thou be willing remove this cup from me nevertheless not my will but thine be done he was not praying to change the father's mind he was praying to change him yeah right this is what Paul means in 1 Corinthians 9:27 he said I keep under my body and bring it into subjection lested by any means when I have preached to others I myself should be a cast away he said I keep under my body how do you do that church you can't do that by by watching movies all the time and and going to uh going to uh entertainment all the time I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that I'm saying that's not how you bring the body under subjection right that that pleases the body it doesn't bring it under subjection what does prayer and fasting right boy got real quiet but it's still true when I preach to others he said I could be a cast away if I don't keep my body under subjection through prayer brother Brandon sees the results of prayer leaving the American Home the prayer that keeps you from temp ation and causes you to appreciate what you have as a gift from God brother Brandon said home life is uncertain he said I tell you I don't know what's happened to the moral fiber of our women divorce is on the move it's just terrible and you see where the divorce courts are crowded where girls and boys will marry and live together and have two or three kitties or something another like that and they'll separate and get out and marry another marry another marry another marry another marry another in their homes now today they don't even bother to get married I'm not trying to be hard on you I know we everybody body's got a past but thank God for the word that pulls us back to our future calls us away from our past to our future he said I was in a real a poor real poor home the other night and the man said I tell you he said I just don't know said I just don't know how I'm going to make ends meat I looked around he worked said he had a little old wife there just as true blue as could be four or five little old dirty faed kids on the floor I said boy you're a millionaire amen he said huh well brother brandom I wouldn't fut your word he said brother I ain't got a dime I said but you got something money can't buy right you got a little wife here that probably had got two dresses to her name and if she did is some some somebody give her cu the man just has a day's work now and then I said look at here but she's just as loyal as loyal can be I said there's many a multimillionaire tonight would give every penny he had to come home to a wife like that I said his wife is out with a bunch of men somewhere in a barroom somewhere cussing singing smoking night riding around things like that yet he loves her but look what he's got all of his life wrapped up in that woman look the way she's doing vice versa women to man he said there's no difference it's come time where all everything is just one conglomeration of sin little old woman at home trying to take care of her kids or husband out somewhere drunk and carrying on run with other women what would she give if she had millions of dollars to see that husband really become a man there's only one way for it to ever be Jesus Christ is the answer you want to be a real man you want to be a man that prays you want to be a man full of the Holy Ghost he is is the answer right amen he said there's no nothing can ever do any good at the end time it's Christ and him alone amen brand said we've never had a time we've had so many divorces in peace time as we got now our home life has broke up years ago it used to be that mother and dad was home at night if it wasn't for Church times or something they never let their children roam the streets run around all night long nowadays it seems to be kind of a popular opinion said oh how you just go to the home today look what it is Papa he has to hurry down to the pool room the boys are playing pool or they're bowling or something and him and M sister's at the canteen somewhere out some rock and roll party Junior's got the hot rod out seeing how many he can run down say that's about home life now let's just update that a little bit shall we huh because we don't hardly relate to that you think about it so well we don't do none of that we don't go nowhere but now Paul is gambling on sports just let that settle for a little bit you know it's still gambling even though it's Sports m's on Instagram sisters dancing on Tik Tok we used to forgive me there there was a girl on on a road that we used to drive on or we drove on to get to our house and and every day when the kids get out of school we drive past and that girl had already been dropped off and we drive past and that girl was out there dancing in the yard and I couldn't figure it out I was like you know it's fine I'm glad she's happy you know but she's out there doing cartwheels and jumping and stuff and the kid oh she's making videos for Tik Tok out in the yard and I guess somebody watches it I don't know and and you know and then Junior's on some dating site seeing how many he can run down right it just changed but it's still the same spirit right right right only we all do it from our pockets now carry our phones and everybody's sitting at home but nobody's there right now look said in the Bible oh it's a great book but it's put in a drawer somewhere until Pastor comes in or somebody and we just don't have the home life we used to have home life's so uncertain said a man nowadays getting married you young fellas you better pray a long time you better pray a long time huh we say that again you better pray a long time ask God to give you a companion you young women the same way because it's so uncertain he said in California I found out over there I think it was either 15 or 20% something like that a perversion perverted people has increased in the last year or two this is in 1961 he's talking about in California how it had increased and today and I've given you this before and it seems almost unfathomable but somewhere around 75% of young people identify themselves as something other than a than a normal as we would say a straight male or female 7 34s of the people and I don't even say it's their fault it's the culture they live in it's just what they do it's what it's what gets them attention and they're starving for love starving for attention and that's what get some attention right true brother Brandon said notice in this day home life has become a situation ought to be dealt with my you little boy going out taking a rifle and shootting Papa and Mama while they're laying in bed dishonesty amongst our women and men our mothers and fathers we should never be dishonest with one another we should have everything completely clear between one and another there should be nothing we have to keep from our husbands and wives and we've said that comically about guns and bows and things like that you but you don't make purchases without your wife knowing right or at least knowing that you have her approval to do it right right if you know she wouldn't be happy with it or vice versa he wouldn't be happy with it come to an agreement before you do it boy this is this good stuff this morning I I don't say that very often brother Stuart but this must be good stuff but he said dishonesty if you hide money money you hide other things in lots of big cities the husband and wife pack secret keys or said same Keys pass keys to their apartment each one comes in eats a meal somewhere one's got a date the other one's got a date no more decency no respects at home homes in these days don't have the old fashion homes he said might too many doesn't have where the Bible's open and dad reads the chapter they kneel around the table and pray people go in and sit down and eat he said I've seen people go to the table and just start ging slopping around eating never ask the blessing I remember when I was in Africa I man brother Ivy and somebody else was there with us and and I brother Robert Wilson and I remember sitting there at the table man I was iing that food as soon as they brought it out man I started eating I'm sitting there a bunch of preachers and they looked at me I forgot to pray my kids caught me the other day but we should make time to pray because that's a blessing that we get to eat he he said I noticed one time it was out when we was living on the farm it was under a hog there was a hog under an apple tree and them apples was falling off and hitting him on the head and he eat apples all day long he never did look up to see where they was coming from where does my strength come from to work where does your strength come from to to live and and do the things that you do where do you get the strength to pick up your fork and eat that meal it come from God it didn't come from the government it didn't come from somebody else it come from God the blessings you have come from God we ought to thank him for it church we ought to love him for it he said you don't realize where food comes from you better look up and thank God for it because he was the one who gave it he said we we don't have no more security of the home send your children are school what do they teach them out there many times too many times they teach them we come from apes he said well we don't believe that and if a man's no more than an animal then eat drink and be married so that's what makes so many juvenile delinquents that's what makes so many crimes committed because if people no more than an animal it makes them act like an animal we need to teach our children at home my kids went to public school and they were younger and we since pulled them out but but they did go to public school but they already knew before they went to school how Man was created right they knew the story before they went to school and so when they went to school they dismissed that they didn't even think about that they said you wouldn't believe what they're teaching down at the school right and we know better than that why we've been taught by people we trust we've been taught the truth teach your children the truth you said we got to tell him he's a Son of God born for the kingdom of God he is somebody right come on he said this is amen he said this is just a negative a picture negative waiting for it to be developed someday and death is the only thing that can develop it he said when you die out to yourself a new picture starts on the inside and then that new creature Christ Jesus begin to show itself through and one of these days he will come and receive you up to himself then the whole thing will be changed then this negative Shadow will become a positive teach your kids that this isn't all there is but there's something more something greater they just won't follow what everybody else does uh how do we have peace in our homes well I think one of the ingredients of peace is to pursue the word look for the word Paul or David rather says order my steps in thy word let not any iniquity have dominion over me Luke 4:16 Jesus comes to Nazareth where he'd been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up for to read so his custom was to go to church and read the word and that's what we ought to do is go to church and read read the word do you believe that today I got to put my glasses on Sarah is that you my goodness it's good to have you in church this morning completely missed my sister being at church God's good to us isn't he it matters look people still go to church but it's become a striptise Sodom and Gomorrah right in the churches brother brand said home life has become uncertain said you know I seen a piece the other day in one of the journals somewhere that the American divorce rate is higher than any other nation in the world we're supposed to be a religious Nation he said yes could be that religion all right but it's not the right kind said religion is just a covering we don't want just religion we want the power of God we want a God who heals a God who saves a God who changes lives you believe he he's that kind of God today you believe he's still that kind of God sir your daughter had a liver transplant I believe the Lord Lord healed her and kept her brother the West sister glorious daughter my sister Sarah had a liver transplant she's a walking testimony of what God can do in somebody's life when she was four months old and and that's all right today she's off of medicine doesn't doesn't take any medicine I don't believe rejection medicine to this day was the first child to ever be taken off completely uh at the time that was taken off it a lot of years ago 1994 when that happened think about it God's still God we don't want just religion come on we want a reality we want something that works religion is just a covering he said it's hard to tell what we make our covering out of Adam tried to make some out of fig Le it didn't work he got awful shaky when he had to come out to meet God religion doesn't mean it at all but could you think he said our divorce rate higher all the rest of the countries our divorce rate you said we find immorality on the Move in our homes said it was astounding to find out a great percent on the survey of the nation I believe was in Ohio a survey was taking Christianity he said it was alarming what a percent that did not even go to church and then about 80% of those that went to church didn't know why they went it's important to go to church but it's also important to know why you go he said well mother took us when we was a kid and we just keep on going and then another percent said they went just for all to meet their neighbors and talk a while he said well it's alarming no wonder the home life is gone any home life that's not stable see it reflects to the church because the home life's not right and so we ought to pursue the word go to church and know why we go read the word now look he said one of the great lackings of our day today in America and the rest of the world is Godly Parents has had an influence upon their children the parents of this day has got away from the principles of the scripture they went more to the Fashions of the world the churches did the same thing he said in doing that we let it loose and brought the world into the church that's the reason we have this great have he said if I say it respectfully here before these young people the reason we got so many hoods and so forth as they call it and bad characters too much of it is because the home life that they were influenced by in their earlier days he said I'm still a Believer and bring up a child in the way it should go and when it gets old it will not depart from it he said but brother Ben I'm hurrying through this morning but we're we're doing good on time but you say brother Ben I've done all this I've I I've I've set the word before my children I prayed for them there's there's other ingredients that go into making a home full of Peace you got to have love right there's got to be some joy in the home yeah right fruits of the spirit because otherwise kids aren't comfortable spouses aren't comfortable I think most of all maybe the most important because we can talk about all those things but forgiveness forgiveness see Jesus said in Mark 11:25 he said when you pray forgive right yes every time you pray forgive don't pray without forgiving that's a commandment from God When you stand praying forgive if you have ought against any brother BR says that's any say if you have a scratch of a against any sinner or Saint you're in danger of Hell Fire what brother brandom said pursue forgiveness forgiveness forgiveness is tough yeah it's tough to forgive yeah when you stand praying forgive if you have ought against any that your father also which is in heaven May forgive you your trespasses right and the problem is that is an attribute of God and it takes the Holy Ghost to do that but brother brand says this he talks about a man or a young boy I've read it to you many times but I just want to read this portion talks about a young boy that shouldn't get married he said that young boy that shouldn't get married the reason why he shouldn't get married he said is because he could not forgive he couldn't ask for forgiveness and he couldn't forgive and he talked about it he said they know it's right but it's just not in them to ask forgiveness or ask pardoning they just won't do it it's just not in them he said now the genes in the father and the mother of this boy no matter how much they're converted two remains the flesh has been interbred out to this boy therefore the boy's got a complex in him just like from his mother's family they're not forgiving they will not apologize and that's where the boy stands right and the father said my son went to the altar he was baptized correctly in the name of Jesus Christ and he said he said I know my son has come to Christ and I said that may be all right all the outward motions he might be identified as a Believer with the Believers but until he's regenerated born again he said I'd advise that young man to never marry a woman he'll make hell on Earth for her until that gentle sweet forgiving Spirit of Christ comes in without it home is going to be a place of chaos because people in a home are going to make mistakes every one of us live with the human element we are humans so we have to forgive Jesus didn't have to have forgiveness but he gave us forgiveness you imagine living a life for you never had to say you're sorry you realize Jesus lived that kind of life but he still said father forgive them Father forgive them they don't know what they're doing oh I'm so glad for a God who can forgive who not only forgives but has the capacity to forget and throw it in the sea of his forgetfulness as though it never happened in the first place oh what a mighty revelation we have in this day of of what of what justification is how it takes us away from what we were from our old sinful nature makes something new out of us good I advise that young man to never marry a woman he'll make hell on Earth for her see Jesus understood that without forgiveness from the heart this world is so broken will never survive and I want to counsel you young people and you young families you young parents unless you can forgive you'll never survive if you can't forgive your parents you'll never forgive your spouse you'll never forgive your children and it'll never be peace in the home right but he said this even even more than that he said if you do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses so our own forgiveness hinges on us forgiving see Jesus died so we could be forgiven and without the cross you see we were in chaos against God how many believe that today how me understand that we were separated from God and without the cross we could never no amount of rules could ever bring the human race into fellowship with God they had hundreds of laws they had all kinds of things that they had set up that they did and some people even tried to live it to the letter right and yet they all failed to live it right and Paul says he was guilty of one letter of the law is guilty of the whole thing right but it took the cross it took the cross to bring forgiveness because the Human family was broken yeah and God had to give forgiveness for us to be whole again don't you realize we got to forgive one another look you you say well you see legalism will never bring peace to your home sir you're never going to have peace in your home because you said about your rules and then they break them well they're going to break them that's right and we should have rules but that's not what brings peace to the home what brings peace to the home is love and forgiveness not the rules and if we get to a place where they broke the rule we're going to cast them off how can you cast off your own flesh you can't do that yes sir you Cast Away your own family oh that gives us a great picture of God doesn't it brother Brandon said that Abraham when Abraham and Sarah and and and here MDC comes and and he speaks God in flesh and says you're going to have a baby and Sarah laughed in the tent behind Abraham brother BR said God would have smoted her dead right then but she was part of Abraham Oh my he couldn't hurt her without hurting Abraham you can't be lost if you're a child of God you belong to God I'm so glad for that today amen legalism will never bring peace to your home see more rules and we have rules we sat down and wrote out a little contract the other day told the kids this when you're going to get up and this is when we have rules but forgiveness and love is the is the grease that makes the engine not overheat and I want you to understand you forgive me for just being myself this morning but I want us to understand how he forgives us when's the last time you went to God for forgiveness this morning for most of us did he make you wait if you were really sorry did he make you wait sir if you really come to God and you said I'm sorry I I didn't Lord you know I'm stupid I didn't mean to do that I didn't mean to say that what does he do he forgives you why do we make other people wait right he doesn't make you suffer he already suffered for you he doesn't make you pay for it you realize that nothing that happens in your life is retribution from God right nothing that happens in your life is retribution from God because if God hated you and wanted to hurt you don't you realize that he would he he would be doing he would be denying his own death and the suffering he went through right he he suffered for us and if that was sufficient for our sins then he can't make us suffer for sin he can put us allow us to go through trials for our Perfection for character but he cannot make us suffer for sin right we can't suffer when he already suffered for sin and died once for all listen so what do we have to do he don't make us wait I want us to think about this for a moment before we close he doesn't make us wait and suffer he said brother believe the story accept it and be born again yeah amen he does sit there you know how we do sometimes with our spouses or our children I'm going to make him chew on that for a while make him suffer make her suffer not what he did he just wants you to believe the story accept it and be born again that's all he wants you to do today just believe it you say well I can't prove it's true nobody can just believe it I don't have any scientific proof of this message being right but it is and you say how do you know it is because it works it works in our lives it works with our children it works in our homes it works for those who have fallen to get them back up again just believe it accept it be born again he don't make you suffer for your sin right so if I come back to church I'd have to go through a period of suffering and drag myself over some Stones since when was that part of the Gospel he don't make you suffer for sin he said walk up with pure faith knowing this that God is promised and God can't lie God promised me eternal life if I believe on his son Jesus Christ I believed it and he gave me eternal life Hallelujah he said I made many mistakes still make them will always make them but when I make them the Holy Spirit tells me that's wrong then I Repent right there Lord forgive me didn't mean to do it you help me now when is the time to repent whenever you do the wrong and you know it don't make somebody wait on an apology and don't make them wait to forgive them yeah he don't make you wait said I didn't mean to do it you help me now and I walk right on the same thing just no sooner than it goes from my lips no sooner than it goes from my lips if we confess our sins he is just to forgive them it's all right he said the devil say you know what I'll tell you you were supposed to go do a certain thing you didn't do it oh you sin didn't you I say I confessed it no you said don't he said well I tell you don't don't talk to me me no sir I have perfect faith in he who told me if I confess my wrongs he would forgive me so I confess it just go on away from me I don't care nothing about you anyhow keep moving on don't listen to the devil he has forgiven you he has forgiven you if he has forgiven you you can walk free said just walk up with a pure Faith believe what God Said sir you know when you try to make somebody else suffer for their sins do you know what you're doing you're making yourself suffer all you're doing you're bringing suffering into your own life just let it go let God do what God does let him bring peace to this house see the token in in the Old Testament was peace to the home it was applied to you know that they they knew they believed a prophet's word when he said the death Angel's coming but if you'll strike the the doorpost and the Lin with blood when I pass through the land when when the death angel comes you will not die your firstborn will not die when I see the token I'll pass over you and the baptism of the Holy Ghost the true baptism of the Holy Ghost today the token speaks peace in our homes amen see brother B when I see the token I'll pass over you it's a sign it's a sign the price has been paid Jesus Paid the price and you received it from him holding the token in your hand you have an assurance of Resurrection you said but brother Ben you don't know what I've done you don't know where I've been but you have the token in your hand right I I don't necessarily need your life story I just need the you need to have the token in your hand if if he's forgiven you you're going you may have to deal with all kind of scars you may have to deal with all kinds of trouble people may look at you sideways but you're going not because a preacher said you were not because somebody else said you were but because you have the token in your hand and if you don't have it this morning Now's the Time to get a hold of it get your ticket now the Train's about to leave the station the plane is is taxing down the TAC we're going home Now's the Time to get it get a token in your hand it's good you get that token in your hand you really get it on display you won't hold grudges against people hate people have hatred in your heart there'll be peace in your heart you want peace in your home how many can say I want peace in my home I want peace in this home pursue it run after it pursue the things that make peace yeah pursue prayer pursue forgiveness pursue the word pursue the token let it be on display don't wait on it pursue it let God have his way would you bow your heads with me for just a moment got to give forgiveness if you're ever going to get it might be the time to forgive somebody I'm talking to Christians well as maybe if you're not you should do that too I sure wouldn't want to not be forgiven I wonder if we've been pursuing prayer like we ought to I I think all of us every day could say Lord forgive me I need to pray more I need to lead my family in prayer I'm standing before you today as a human being We're Not Angels preachers aren't angels I need to pursue prayer in my [Music] home that'll bring peace do you pursue the word or you take church and leave it you can take the word and leave it take the Bible and leave it take the message or leave it or do you to it you make time for it that God help me today I want to make time for the [Music] word can you pursue forgiveness can you forgive [Music] yourself that's the first one you got to forgive can you forgive yourself that's hard but you got to take that pure faith and say Lord I know you died for me you paid the price of my sin on Calvary so that I could be free pursue that pursue that peace in your life You' been running in the world some of you ran you know what it's like you run and the world can't provide peace but he can let the Prince of Peace come in pursue the things that make peace in your home he is the Prince of Peace pursue the token let's just do that today you just talk to God in your own way see Hands Up tears in people's eyes I I don't know maybe you need to come here this morning would like to do that I the altar is open if you'd like to pray I we'd love to see you come but just pursue peace pursue the peace of God in your heart pursue prayer pursue time with God and watch what a difference it makes let's pursue the presence of God in our church services let's pursue it Church let's not just let it but it may happen or may not let's run after it let's go get it Heavenly Father Lord we know we need you today I need you I'm standing here Lord behind the pulpit but the pulpit is not a separation between me and the people because I'm standing on the same level that they are Lord I recognize that that Satan has come in the God of this evil age has come in and tried to twist people's minds that it's so Twisted that people don't even know what what they are who they are but Lord we find our identity in you our peace in you would you just come oh God would you come down where we're at right now I pray for every home Lord that there would be peace at passes understanding I pray there would be peace between husbands and wives I pray there would be peace Lord in homes where maybe there there there's no husband or maybe the husband doesn't serve the Lord I pray there'd be peace in that home that passes understanding in homes Lord where where maybe a man struggles or a widower oh God I pray you'd give them peace as well maybe they don't have a family to lead but oh God they still have a part to play I pray you'd help them today for our elders oh God I pray you'd bring peace Lord For The Devil would try to bring worry and struggle and trouble or knowing they they got more of their life behind them than in front of them or sometimes that brings stress to us but oh God we know that you're still the Prince of Peace would you reach down to the homes of our elders Lord Lord and just give them strength Lord give him encouragement I think of brother Paul Lord sitting there today Lord he's probably listening right now but he's he's hurting right now he's weak in his body but Lord I know that your God was a Healer I pray you'd heal him today Lord I pray for each one each one that has sickness oh God may you bring peace

I'm trusting and resting in the promise of God I'm trusting and resting while on this Earth I TR with the word of God down in my soul who gives my Jesus complete control I'm trusting and resting in the promise of God well I'm trusting and resting in in the promise of God I'm trusting and resting while on this Earth I try down in my soul it gives my Jesus complete control I trust rest in the promise of God [Music]
