[48:10] on the 12 tribes that's not much of a
[48:13] blessing is it and yet you see two boys
[48:17] United together doing the same thing
[48:20] having the same curse really given to
[48:22] them and they went completely different
[48:25] directions we want to talk talk about
[48:27] that tonight God bless you as uh we uh
[48:30] have our seats this
[48:34] evening I want to continue our series on
[48:37] the sons of Jacob we found out about
[48:39] Reuben that God can take a a a terrible
[48:42] situation a terrible mistake that Ruben
[48:45] made and a a passion that he had and God
[48:49] turned that around and actually become a
[48:51] benefit uh to the people of God and in
[48:54] the end all wrongs were made right and
[48:55] we find you had a place there in the
[48:59] land in in in the Millennium and so
[49:02] we're thankful that God is a god of
[49:03] mercy and God is a god of Grace and he
[49:06] doesn't change his thought towards us
[49:08] and and the sons of Jacob were all we
[49:11] could say predestined elected they were
[49:14] called by God they were God's chosen
[49:16] people and yet they messed up and and
[49:19] they had trouble and all of that but yet
[49:21] God brought them out and I'm so thankful
[49:23] he brings us out but the Levi I'm glad
[49:26] I'm going preach on Levi tonight a
[49:27] little bit and I'm glad that LE that
[49:29] that that God brought us out and and he
[49:32] he gave us another chance and he he's
[49:34] given us the ability in this hour to
[49:37] live above what we would naturally be
[49:39] and so we have not a natural allotment
[49:41] but a spiritual allotment and and and we
[49:44] have a place in the house of God we have
[49:46] a place in the economy of God we have a
[49:49] place in the things of the god in the
[49:52] word of God and so brother brandham
[49:54] talked about this and the reason I'm
[49:56] dealing with that uh he said there's a
[49:58] great lesson he said that sometime I
[50:00] hope to be able to bring it to son of
[50:01] those Hebrew mothers giving birth to
[50:03] those babies when she Gran at the birth
[50:06] pain of the baby she called the name of
[50:07] the baby that positionally placed it in
[50:10] the promised land its tribe he said the
[50:13] great thing all someone say all all the
[50:17] word of God fits right together if it
[50:20] doesn't fit together it's not God's word
[50:24] that's Misfit it's your thought
[50:27] in God's word your thought is misfitting
[50:31] to the word it all fits together so we
[50:35] want to get our thoughts and line them
[50:37] up with the word of God I'm not
[50:39] attempting uh to do what brother brandom
[50:41] wouldn't do or didn't do or preach a
[50:43] message he didn't preach but to take
[50:45] what he did say in different places and
[50:47] compare it with scripture the Bible says
[50:49] all scripture is given by inspiration of
[50:52] God is profitable for Doctrine for
[50:54] reproof for correction and for
[50:56] instruction and righteousness so we want
[50:59] to look at the scripture and that's our
[51:00] real meat isn't it is the word of God
[51:03] that's where we get our that's where we
[51:05] live as Christians that's what we live
[51:07] by so when we when we look at the
[51:09] scripture especially when we're looking
[51:11] at the Old Testament we need to remember
[51:13] this rule that we need to ask ourselves
[51:17] where is Christ in it where is Christ in
[51:21] it because brother Brenham tells us he
[51:23] is the principal theme of the entire
[51:26] Bible is Christ so if you read the Bible
[51:29] and don't see Christ in every verse of
[51:32] it go back and read it again so we we
[51:36] want to ask ourselves as we read this as
[51:38] we look at these things where is Christ
[51:40] in it because he'll show up somewhere
[51:43] and he shows up everywhere because all
[51:45] of the Old Testament types and shadows
[51:48] point to him and they are all fulfilled
[51:51] in him they all point to him and they
[51:54] are all fulfilled in him just as the New
[51:57] Testament points to the bride and is
[51:59] fulfilled in the bride the Old Testament
[52:02] points to Christ and is fulfilled in
[52:04] Christ every scripture dovetails with
[52:07] the rest of the Bible you ever heard
[52:08] that term dovetail it's what they do
[52:11] remember how they used to make furniture
[52:13] they would take a piece of furniture and
[52:14] they would dovetail it together they
[52:16] would I always love to see that because
[52:18] that means the furniture is old because
[52:20] people just don't do that anymore and
[52:22] maybe some people do the mark might do
[52:24] that when he builds a piece of furniture
[52:26] but they would dovetail it together and
[52:27] it would lock together so brother
[52:29] brandham taught us that scripture
[52:31] dovetails together and he taught us if
[52:33] our if it doesn't our understanding is
[52:35] wrong but when we get our in the end
[52:37] what picture do we want the picture is
[52:40] Christ the picture is Christ now we want
[52:44] to deal tonight with Simeon and Levi
[52:46] Simeon and Levi are linked together in
[52:50] Jacob's prophecy yes and he said
[52:53] instruments of Cruelty are in their
[52:56] habitation
[52:58] and as I've already told you they're
[53:00] linked together but they have very
[53:01] different outcomes and we went over that
[53:02] last week we got to overcome right we
[53:05] got something a place we got to fight
[53:08] something we got to do to be able to
[53:10] overcome because we're all born in in
[53:11] sin shapen in iniquity come into the
[53:13] world speaking lies and yet we have a
[53:15] spiritual land that belongs to us
[53:18] something we should possess something
[53:20] that we've been called to do a place
[53:22] that we've been called to and settled in
[53:24] and and we got to possess that we got to
[53:26] become a part of that and yet Satan's
[53:28] going to do everything that he can to
[53:30] keep us away from that and so the battle
[53:33] is to our position it's not a battle to
[53:35] become sons of God we can't make
[53:37] ourselves sons of God but if you are a
[53:40] son of God you battle and you fight for
[53:42] your position you young men you battle
[53:45] for the position that God called a young
[53:46] man to be in this age you us older
[53:49] people we battle for the position that
[53:51] God called whether it's a pastor or or
[53:53] an evangelist or a song leader or or or
[53:55] a prayer Warrior Whatever It Is God
[53:57] called you and wants you to be you got
[53:59] to battle you got to fight for that
[54:00] position and you got to overcome in that
[54:03] position right and so every every inch
[54:05] of it is yours but you got to fight for
[54:07] every inch of it good so siming and Levi
[54:12] are are are are together in this
[54:15] blessing or this prophecy and it's a
[54:18] common theme to The Scriptures you look
[54:20] at Jacob and Esau he said I'll take one
[54:22] and leave one and even uh even all
[54:26] through the scriptures you'll find that
[54:28] uh he said there'll be two and one in a
[54:29] bed and I'll take one and leave one and
[54:32] and I love one and and love the other
[54:35] less and so there's all kinds of of
[54:37] examples of that in the scripture and
[54:40] yet this difference they were both sons
[54:43] they were both elected they were both
[54:45] called but not to the same
[54:47] thing so in Genesis
[54:50] 29:33 the Bible tells us how Simeon was
[54:53] born Simeon means hearing or for God has
[54:57] heard it's she conceived again and bear
[55:00] son this is Leah uh the wife of Jacob
[55:03] and she said because the Lord hath heard
[55:06] that I was hated yet therefore give me
[55:08] this son also she called his name Simeon
[55:11] Ruben had already been born and so she's
[55:13] saying this is my payback this is my
[55:16] revenge you remember there's a little
[55:17] bit of a war going on in the household
[55:19] cuz Jacob had W too many
[55:21] wives right anytime you have one too
[55:23] many wives there's war in the house on
[55:25] so Jac jaob had one too many wives
[55:27] there's war in the household so Leah
[55:29] says now now I've had two sons and and
[55:32] Rachel hasn't had any yeah so this is my
[55:35] revenge so this is the Lord has heard me
[55:38] and I have another another son and and
[55:40] Levi in the next verse Levi means joined
[55:44] it literally is adhesive glue glue and
[55:49] we'll we'll see how this uh matters
[55:51] after a while but in Genesis 29:34 she
[55:54] conceived again and Bar son said now
[55:57] this time will my husband be joined unto
[56:00] me it's the same idea of cleaving
[56:03] husband and wife cleaving to one another
[56:05] because I have borne him three sons
[56:07] therefore was his name called Levi so
[56:10] Levi means joined or cleaved to and
[56:16] Jacob when he when he's giving this this
[56:19] prophecy over their lives he he
[56:21] continues in Genesis 49:6 he says oh my
[56:24] soul come not thou into the secret to
[56:27] their assembly my honor be not thou
[56:29] United in other words I don't want my
[56:31] name associated with them I don't want
[56:33] to I don't want to be around them I
[56:35] don't want to be identified with them
[56:37] for in their anger they slew a man and
[56:40] in their self-will they dig down a wall
[56:43] and you can find the story we won't go
[56:45] into the story tonight maybe we'll get
[56:47] to it later but in Genesis 34 you find a
[56:50] horrific story of Retribution and
[56:53] revenge that when Dina the daughter of
[56:56] Jacob was taken and and and abused
[57:00] really by a young man there in the city
[57:03] yet he wanted to marry her and he tried
[57:04] to make it right and so what do we need
[57:06] to do and they said well you just have
[57:08] all the men of the city circumcised and
[57:09] they did that and then when it's it's
[57:12] it's pretty terrible then when they did
[57:14] that Simeon and Levi destroy the whole
[57:17] city take everybody captive it's
[57:20] brutal right and they did it for a
[57:23] reason it was redneck retribution you
[57:26] can
[57:26] say right they said and you can see some
[57:29] of that in Israel today you can still
[57:31] see a strain of that that if you kill
[57:33] one of ours we'll kill a million of
[57:35] yours right we're going to do that we're
[57:37] going to make it so massive that it's
[57:39] shock and all right you don't mess with
[57:41] us and so that's what it was but Jacob
[57:44] said it was wrong yeah and because it
[57:47] wasn't inspired by God it wasn't in the
[57:49] word right it was their own anger was
[57:52] their own temper are you with me now and
[57:56] so they destroyed an a whole city out of
[57:58] out of
[57:59] Retribution uh Genesis 49:7 cursed be
[58:02] their anger for it was fierce and their
[58:04] wrath for it was cruel I will divide
[58:07] them in Jacob and scatter them in Israel
[58:09] so they're neither one given a land or
[58:12] or or a territory with boundaries within
[58:15] the land of Israel if you look at a map
[58:17] and I don't have a map here tonight but
[58:19] if you look at a map of the tribes it
[58:21] looks like simeon's got a spot right in
[58:23] the middle of Judah and the truth is it
[58:25] was just certain cities that Simeon had
[58:28] within Judah they would always be
[58:30] overshadowed by ruled by and a part of
[58:33] Judah and you'll find that the Levites
[58:36] were spread of course you know more
[58:37] famously uh throughout the land they
[58:40] were not uh the Levites did not have a
[58:42] land at all and they ended up serving in
[58:45] the temple right and again both tribes
[58:47] under the same
[58:49] prophecy right under the same you know
[58:52] and many times we want to use our
[58:53] upbringing or what we come out of or
[58:55] what we come through sort of an excuse
[58:58] for the way that we are and yet you'll
[59:00] find two people coming under the same uh
[59:02] sort of set of circumstances and they
[59:05] end up in different
[59:07] places right why because of decisions
[59:09] that are made and and things that that
[59:12] are done and though they may be very
[59:14] similar yet they're not the same right
[59:16] they're not the same they're they're two
[59:18] different boys they're uh they have two
[59:20] different Futures so uh they had vastly
[59:23] different outcomes now the tribe of I
[59:26] and that's why we should never feel bad
[59:28] about somebody because of their family
[59:30] right right because you could have one
[59:32] person be Hitler but not everybody in
[59:33] the family's
[59:35] Hitler right like literally Hitler as
[59:38] people like to say today you you could
[59:40] have one person be a a murderer a and
[59:44] another boy in the same family and you
[59:46] could look at that maybe a serial killer
[59:48] and look at him and say well this and
[59:49] this and this what caused him but maybe
[59:51] his brother went through the same
[59:53] stuff right and he never become that and
[59:56] you see a difference in outcomes and
[59:59] maybe at the beginning you couldn't tell
[1:00:00] the difference but as they grow you
[1:00:02] begin to see what they are so the tribe
[1:00:05] of Simeon is missing from the blessing
[1:00:09] of Moses in Deuteronomy if you go to
[1:00:11] Deuteronomy you'll find all of the the
[1:00:13] tribes where Moses is blessing the
[1:00:15] tribes the tribe of Simeon is not even
[1:00:17] in there and we find that Simeon was
[1:00:20] Jacob's second oldest son his progeny uh
[1:00:23] never achieved a position of prominence
[1:00:25] in Israel before after the conquest and
[1:00:28] occupation of Canaan and they provided
[1:00:30] no judges the song of Deborah contains
[1:00:33] no references to the group you say why
[1:00:35] did that happen brother Ben because of
[1:00:38] anger now now let me get I know we're
[1:00:41] we're Wednesday night crowd tonight but
[1:00:43] but just let me be frank with you and
[1:00:46] I'm not preaching at you because as far
[1:00:48] as I know we got a fine lovely group of
[1:00:50] people that never lose their temper but
[1:00:52] we're going to talk about that tonight
[1:00:55] because it does make a difference and
[1:00:57] we'll find out what that is and what
[1:00:59] causes it now they did fight along with
[1:01:02] Judah and they were included in judah's
[1:01:04] territory again we can look at these
[1:01:06] young men these and these tribes and
[1:01:08] realize they weren't you know they
[1:01:10] weren't all bad right they they had some
[1:01:12] good parts some good things that they
[1:01:14] did and yet they were a part of Judah
[1:01:16] Joshua 19:1 says the second lot came
[1:01:19] forth to Simeon even for the tribe of
[1:01:21] the children of Simeon according to
[1:01:22] their families their inheritance was
[1:01:24] within the inheritance of the children
[1:01:25] of of Judah out of the portion of the
[1:01:28] children of Judah was the inheritance of
[1:01:29] the children of Simeon the part of the
[1:01:31] children of Judah was too much for them
[1:01:33] therefore the children of Simon had
[1:01:34] their inheritance within the inheritance
[1:01:35] of them you'll find that at the
[1:01:37] beginning of the Exodus Simeon had uh I
[1:01:39] think the second most numbers of people
[1:01:42] uh in their tribe and by the end of The
[1:01:44] Exodus they had the fewest were the
[1:01:46] smallest tribe and there's a reason for
[1:01:48] that we'll get to it in just a moment I
[1:01:49] hope I'm not boring you tonight are you
[1:01:51] still with me so they they lived in in
[1:01:54] the desert part of Judah they lived in
[1:01:56] the neb desert they fought constantly
[1:01:59] because they lived on the border and
[1:02:00] they lived in a part of the land where
[1:02:02] was wild it never was quite settled so
[1:02:05] we find that they did not multiply like
[1:02:07] Judah did you'll find in 1st Chronicles
[1:02:10] 4: 24- 27 it lists the sons of Simeon
[1:02:14] the grandsons and great grandson and it
[1:02:17] gets down to shemiah in 1 Chronicles
[1:02:20] 4:27 it says shemiah had 16 sons and six
[1:02:24] daughters now that's a big
[1:02:26] family 16 of scks brother Joe you got a
[1:02:29] ways to
[1:02:30] go and and so he had what is that 16 and
[1:02:34] six
[1:02:35] 24 22 thank you brother Bill I can't
[1:02:39] count either so he had 22 children and
[1:02:42] yet but it said his Brethren had not
[1:02:44] many children and neither did all their
[1:02:46] family multiply like to the children of
[1:02:49] Judah so they became a very small
[1:02:52] tribe because Simeon took the punishment
[1:02:56] of the men of Sheck into his own hands
[1:03:00] his family
[1:03:01] suffered look the Bible tells us in
[1:03:04] Romans 12:19 dearly beloved avenge not
[1:03:07] yourselves but rather give Place unto
[1:03:11] wrath give Place unto wrath for it is
[1:03:15] written vengeance is mine I will repay
[1:03:19] sayith the Lord therefore listen what we
[1:03:22] should do listen if you feel like you've
[1:03:24] been wronged if you feel like that that
[1:03:26] somebody's done something that's angered
[1:03:28] you here's what to do about it if thine
[1:03:31] enemy hunger feed
[1:03:35] him come on church if he thirst we're
[1:03:39] not talking about your family we're not
[1:03:41] of course we would if our children are
[1:03:42] thirsty we give them a drink of water
[1:03:44] before they go to bed right but if our
[1:03:46] children are thirsty we we water we give
[1:03:48] them water if our if our children are
[1:03:51] hungry we give them food if our brother
[1:03:53] or our sister are hungry or thirsty we'd
[1:03:55] help them right
[1:03:56] yes but what he say to do he said don't
[1:03:58] take Vengeance into your own hand if
[1:03:59] your enemy hunger feed him if he thirst
[1:04:03] give him drink for in so doing shalt
[1:04:05] thou Heap coals of fire on his head it
[1:04:09] may not change him it may make him worse
[1:04:12] but you are it's the the retribution is
[1:04:15] not coming from you the Vengeance isn't
[1:04:17] coming from you listen what Paul says be
[1:04:20] not overcome of evil other words don't
[1:04:24] let it consume you yeah right people do
[1:04:26] horrible things people say horrible
[1:04:28] things people make a mess out of things
[1:04:31] because they're human beings and and and
[1:04:33] this was an awful thing that the that
[1:04:35] the people of that town of sheam did to
[1:04:38] the to dinina the daughter of Jacob but
[1:04:40] he said don't be like this don't don't
[1:04:42] don't take retribution into your own
[1:04:44] hand don't be overcome by
[1:04:47] evil but overcome evil with good this is
[1:04:52] where we live church I know we like to
[1:04:54] hear great Mysteries and things and we
[1:04:56] want to hear about who we are and and
[1:04:58] and that's part of it and we want to
[1:04:59] preach that and we want to preach the
[1:05:00] blessings of God but this is where we
[1:05:03] live you've got to have a get to a place
[1:05:06] where there's no desire for Retribution
[1:05:09] but you can bless those that bless that
[1:05:11] curse you and curse or bless those that
[1:05:13] that do wrong and despitefully use
[1:05:16] you listen we got we got to be born
[1:05:19] again to do that you can't do that in
[1:05:22] yourself you can't do that according to
[1:05:24] the old man the old man always wants
[1:05:26] retribution he always wants to get back
[1:05:29] he always wants to get even it takes
[1:05:31] something else on the inside it takes a
[1:05:34] new birth yes brother brand said Satan
[1:05:36] does not tempt down in here he tempts
[1:05:40] out here in the flesh right he tempts
[1:05:44] you in your flesh in your spirit not in
[1:05:48] your
[1:05:49] soul he has no access to your soul your
[1:05:53] soul is sealed
[1:05:55] right by the blood but he tempts You In
[1:05:58] the Flesh he said for instance you go
[1:06:00] down the street tomorrow you're walking
[1:06:02] along well if I could whistle I'd
[1:06:04] whistle a song but he said singing
[1:06:06] Christian
[1:06:07] songs and he out there singing every
[1:06:10] promise in the book is mine you're so
[1:06:13] happy you know and somebody
[1:06:16] says you know you're just a
[1:06:21] hypocrite and you say well that don't
[1:06:23] bother you that don't bother you you
[1:06:24] ought to try getting a text you know you
[1:06:27] ever got a text just basically says
[1:06:28] you're a hypocrite I have multiple
[1:06:31] times and you say well why brother Ben

[1:06:50] right talking about you now that's a
[1:06:52] Temptation he said now the first thing
[1:06:54] your flesh picks that up in the ear and
[1:06:57] it suggests to the Mind get even with
[1:07:02] him now come on church I'm not the only
[1:07:04] one that deals with temptation am I yeah
[1:07:07] so you got your fingers poised over the
[1:07:09] keyboard if anybody still uses Facebook
[1:07:11] on their
[1:07:13] computer

[1:07:28] that right and you're ready to get back

[1:07:35] sometimes difficult to hear church but
[1:07:36] we need to hear it come on you're you're
[1:07:38] ready to speak you're ready to to to
[1:07:41] repay H
[1:07:43] hundredfold what they did to you he said
[1:07:47] it's suggested to the Mind get even with
[1:07:48] it time it gets back here he says oh I
[1:07:52] love it this back here says vengeance is
[1:07:56] mine sayith the Lord I will repay amen
[1:08:01] sometimes we just got to give it a
[1:08:02] minute and that's what Paul's talking
[1:08:04] about when he talks about giving space
[1:08:05] to anger right giving giving it space
[1:08:09] don't don't don't don't don't don't let
[1:08:11] he said be angry and sin not Don't Let
[1:08:13] the Sun Go Down on your wrath yeah right
[1:08:16] it takes time don't get don't don't
[1:08:18] immediately respond yeah because you
[1:08:20] respond in the
[1:08:22] flesh so and that's what makes social
[1:08:24] media so Danger
[1:08:26] ous so because it's instant and you want
[1:08:29] they want an instant response so the
[1:08:31] souls under the altar you remember we we
[1:08:34] touched on this not long ago but brother
[1:08:35] random said they could not be the bride
[1:08:38] remember why because they cried for
[1:08:41] vengeance yes he said notice they were
[1:08:44] crying out for vengeance they cannot be
[1:08:47] bride material yeah the bride turns the
[1:08:50] cheek on and cries forgive them Father
[1:08:54] they know not what they do I say God
[1:08:57] help me to be a part of that bride I
[1:08:59] know I can't put myself there but let me
[1:09:01] act like that's what I am cuz I believe
[1:09:03] that's what I am in my heart yes forgive
[1:09:06] them Father they know not what they do
[1:09:09] why because that's what he did and the
[1:09:11] bride has his Spirit on him she's flesh
[1:09:14] of his on her she is flesh of his flesh
[1:09:16] bone of his bones 1 Peter 2:21 for even
[1:09:18] here and two were you're called because
[1:09:20] Christ also suffered for us leaving us
[1:09:23] an example and I repeated this many
[1:09:26] times in fact the man that I learned
[1:09:27] this from died the other day and it kind
[1:09:29] of made me sad cuz it was so vivid in my
[1:09:31] mind when I heard him preach it he he
[1:09:33] said that that word example means the
[1:09:35] model of handwriting copied by a school
[1:09:38] boy and if you can go back and remember
[1:09:41] when you were young right some of you
[1:09:43] young people can remember when you were
[1:09:45] young you can remember when you were in
[1:09:47] kindergarten and you wanted to write and
[1:09:49] you didn't write well and I still don't
[1:09:51] write well but I remember what it was
[1:09:53] like to sit there and and the letters on
[1:09:56] the Blackboard were so perfect because
[1:09:59] the teacher was so good at writing it
[1:10:01] and I was terrible at writing the same
[1:10:04] letter but what would happen is she'd
[1:10:06] come up beside me and and as I tried to
[1:10:09] trace the letter she would actually take
[1:10:11] my hand and she would move the the
[1:10:14] pencil and and and and cause the outline
[1:10:17] until mine look just like hers that's
[1:10:19] what we need church we have an example
[1:10:21] set and we need the teacher to come by
[1:10:24] and and get inside out of us and move
[1:10:26] our hand move our our body to match his
[1:10:30] word it's the only way you'll ever
[1:10:31] follow his steps you're never going to
[1:10:33] do in the flesh it's got to be something
[1:10:36] on the inside that moves you Oh my he
[1:10:40] said he you he's left us an example that
[1:10:42] you should follow his steps who did no
[1:10:44] sin neither was G found in his mouth who
[1:10:46] when he was reviled reviled not again
[1:10:48] when he suffered he threatened not but
[1:10:50] committed himself to him that judgeth
[1:10:52] righteously who his own self bear our
[1:10:54] sins in his own body on the tree that we
[1:10:56] being dead to sin should live into
[1:10:58] righteousness by whose Stripes you is
[1:11:01] anybody sick tonight by whose Stripes
[1:11:03] you were healed you were healed you're
[1:11:05] already healed you just have to believe
[1:11:07] it yes amen good brother brandham has
[1:11:11] asked a
[1:11:13] question I know this may seem like it's
[1:11:15] out of left field but it has it's it's
[1:11:16] on the same topic brother Bram has asked
[1:11:19] the question where are the spirits that
[1:11:20] went into the
[1:11:21] swine you ever think about that where'd
[1:11:24] they go they stay in the swine cuz they
[1:11:26] the swine
[1:11:28] died immediately the swine ran off the
[1:11:31] cliff and killed themselves so where are
[1:11:34] the spirits that went into the swine now
[1:11:38] brother Brandon begins to explain that
[1:11:39] it's a long explanation I won't read it
[1:11:41] all tonight but he he goes into an
[1:11:44] explanation of how this works and he
[1:11:46] tells us he said you never you never
[1:11:49] cast out a devil by the wrong attitude
[1:11:51] and he he types it to that Maniac you
[1:11:53] remember in Portland you remember he was
[1:11:55] a maniac he had no control over himself
[1:11:58] that demon controlled him and so he come
[1:12:01] to brother brandom and said I'm going to
[1:12:02] I'm going to I'm going to kill you right
[1:12:03] I'm GNA beat you up or whatever that he
[1:12:05] threatened to do and brother BR said you
[1:12:08] don't cast out a devil by the wrong
[1:12:09] attitude it takes love to do that and
[1:12:12] love is the most powerful force that
[1:12:13] there is in the world he said now if you
[1:12:15] notice a devil is always hate right you
[1:12:19] young people remember that a devil is
[1:12:20] always hate I don't care if it's a
[1:12:23] preacher I don't care if it's a a
[1:12:25] politician I don't care if it's a your
[1:12:27] neighbor no matter who it is that hates
[1:12:30] people it's a devil making them do that
[1:12:33] right God don't hate right right you say
[1:12:36] well he hated Esau he loved Esau less go
[1:12:38] look up the word right he hates him in
[1:12:40] comparison to the love that he had for
[1:12:43] the elect he said you're to hate your
[1:12:44] mother and father sister and brother for
[1:12:47] his sake but you love him less then you
[1:12:50] do him then you do the word but but the
[1:12:53] devil is always hate and out now hatred
[1:12:56] a temper an
[1:12:57] uncontrollable uh vile towards someone
[1:13:01] is actually a devil we need to
[1:13:04] understand that a devil is always hate
[1:13:06] hater is of the devil he said and when
[1:13:08] people hate someone remember it is a
[1:13:10] terrible devil to despise or dislike you
[1:13:15] mustn't do that so even when we get
[1:13:17] little things between us you know you
[1:13:19] get a little something and something
[1:13:20] will happen that's just the flesh right
[1:13:22] it'll happen it happens but when you
[1:13:25] dwell on it when you keep dwell you know
[1:13:27] what's influencing you to do that right
[1:13:30] it's a
[1:13:31] devil huh that's right that's what
[1:13:34] brother brandom taught us where did the
[1:13:36] demons go that went out of the swine
[1:13:38] well he said some of them was in this
[1:13:39] man in Portland he said Demons of hate
[1:13:43] so and he said sometimes it'll come in a
[1:13:45] mild or religious form he said as long
[1:13:48] as he can keep you thinking you're saved
[1:13:49] and you're not he'd be fine with that
[1:13:51] you might be a good person he said but
[1:13:53] if he has to he said it may be like
[1:13:55] cigarettes he starts with cigarettes if
[1:13:57] that's all he needs to keep you in sin
[1:13:59] then that's what he'll do but he said if
[1:14:01] if not he'll progress to marijuana and
[1:14:03] he'll progress to drugs and he'll Pro
[1:14:06] progress to other things right it
[1:14:08] becomes a Gateway because he'll do
[1:14:10] whatever it takes to keep you from
[1:14:12] listening to the word and he taught us
[1:14:14] that Spirits never die and he said we
[1:14:17] have the spirit of Christ he said now
[1:14:19] the spirit of Elijah upon John would
[1:14:21] make John act like Elijah you remember
[1:14:24] he was out in the Wilderness and and the
[1:14:26] things that he did he acted like Elijah
[1:14:28] if the spirit of Elijah on John would
[1:14:30] make John act like Elijah the spirit of
[1:14:32] God upon you will make you act like
[1:14:35] Jesus how many want to act like Jesus
[1:14:37] how can we do that by the spirit of God
[1:14:40] he said now there's where you find the
[1:14:41] Holy Spirit that's what makes the Holy
[1:14:44] Spirit does that's what the Holy Spirit
[1:14:45] does it makes you Meek makes you humble
[1:14:49] makes you
[1:14:51] forgiving oh this is
[1:14:53] good I find it a challenge sir he said
[1:14:57] could they pull
[1:14:59] whiskers from your face if you had them
[1:15:04] there now come on I know some of y'all
[1:15:08] some of y'all got impressive looking
[1:15:11] beards could someone come up to you it's
[1:15:14] a question we need to ask ourselves and
[1:15:17] again you say well what if the answer is
[1:15:18] no you need to let the Holy Spirit have
[1:15:21] control in your life more as do I are
[1:15:25] you with me now could someone pull
[1:15:27] whiskers could they pull whiskers from
[1:15:29] your face if you had them there jerk
[1:15:31] them out and spit in your face when you
[1:15:34] had the power to call Legions of
[1:15:40] angels we weren't virgin born were we we
[1:15:44] were born in sin so there's something
[1:15:46] here that rises up against
[1:15:49] them but he
[1:15:51] didn't and we have his Spirit which is
[1:15:53] supposed to overpower our human
[1:15:57] nature he said when when you had the
[1:15:59] power to call Legions of angels could
[1:16:01] you do that for the love of the people
[1:16:04] that was spitting in your
[1:16:06] face so if you were the one spitting in
[1:16:09] my face and pulling out my beard for for
[1:16:13] for your salvation for the love that I
[1:16:16] had for you could I just let you do it
[1:16:19] and just stand there if I had the power
[1:16:22] to call Legions of angels if somebody
[1:16:25] just walked up to you and said hey you
[1:16:27] hypocrite and smacked you on one side of
[1:16:30] the face could you pray for their
[1:16:34] forgiveness I don't want to show a hands
[1:16:36] but maybe write it down take it home and
[1:16:38] study it
[1:16:41] right could you pray for their
[1:16:44] forgiveness now listen how serious it is
[1:16:47] he said that's where ATT test whether
[1:16:49] you got the Holy Spirit or
[1:16:51] not he said when somebody says something
[1:16:53] evil against someone because and he was
[1:16:55] counteracting this idea that if you
[1:16:57] speak in tongues you have the Holy Ghost
[1:16:59] right and and they teach that don't
[1:17:01] think about Paul steal people teach if
[1:17:02] you speak in tongues that's the evidence
[1:17:04] of the Holy Ghost there people who teach
[1:17:06] that but brother brother brandom tells
[1:17:08] us he said that's not the evidence he
[1:17:10] said here's a better evidence right not
[1:17:13] the only one but a better one he said
[1:17:15] could you do that when somebody says
[1:17:17] something evil against someone sometimes
[1:17:19] that claims to have the Holy Spirit I
[1:17:22] I'll get even with her if it takes me my
[1:17:24] last day
[1:17:25] he said now there's where you check
[1:17:26] about your Holy Spirit
[1:17:29] on now we're just getting right down to
[1:17:31] the road now aren't we boy I'm enjoying
[1:17:34] preaching
[1:17:36] tonight oh God help me I want to be I'm
[1:17:39] preaching at me
[1:17:41] too blessed are
[1:17:44] you when men shall say all manner of
[1:17:47] evil against you falsely for my name say
[1:17:49] but you go get even with him no he said
[1:17:52] rejoice and be exceedingly glad for so
[1:17:54] person persecuted they the prophets
[1:17:56] which were before you when someone says
[1:17:59] evil about you say something good if you
[1:18:03] can't say something good about them
[1:18:05] don't say nothing just let it go and
[1:18:08] then when you get to yourself pray for
[1:18:13] them oh my I found the closer I am to
[1:18:17] God the more I'm prayed up I am the more
[1:18:22] the more I've I I've beat down the flesh
[1:18:25] if that makes sense like Paul said I
[1:18:27] keep under my body the more that I
[1:18:29] haven't catered to the flesh the more
[1:18:31] I'm able to do this because the spirit
[1:18:33] of Christ does that brother brand tells
[1:18:37] the story again he's still answering
[1:18:38] this question where did the spirits go
[1:18:41] that left the swine and so he goes he
[1:18:44] talks about the boys that he tried to
[1:18:47] shoot you remember the story brother
[1:18:50] brandom had a temper with a capital
[1:18:53] T and he went out when he was I I can't
[1:18:56] remember how old maybe 12 years old and
[1:18:58] he went out and and some boys started
[1:19:01] teasing him and they called him a squab
[1:19:04] they called him it was a halfbreed
[1:19:06] because his I believe his mother was
[1:19:08] part Indian and so he they called him
[1:19:11] that and he got angry he run home and
[1:19:13] got his 22 rifle and he comes back and
[1:19:16] he and he uh he comes back out and he
[1:19:20] hides and waits on him going to be a
[1:19:23] prophet
[1:19:25] huh but he had a
[1:19:27] temper before he got
[1:19:30] saved right it was out of control he
[1:19:33] goes back and he he hides and waits on
[1:19:35] them and when they come along he throws
[1:19:37] a shell in and he squeezes the
[1:19:41] trigger and it don't go off and he used
[1:19:44] every shell that he had and it just spit
[1:19:47] out on the ground and he said he he got
[1:19:50] so mad he was crying maniacally he said
[1:19:53] them boys running and screaming cuz they
[1:19:55] knew he was trying to shoot him he said
[1:19:56] when they left he tried those bullets
[1:19:59] again and every one of them
[1:20:01] worked God was keeping
[1:20:04] him but what was happening was his
[1:20:07] temper was out of control and he said I
[1:20:09] knew I was
[1:20:10] saved he said when people after I got
[1:20:13] met God he said down there by the Ohio
[1:20:15] river and got the Holy Ghost he says
[1:20:17] when people tried to do that to me he
[1:20:19] said people laughed at me made fun of me
[1:20:21] called me a Holy Roller he said I I
[1:20:23] didn't have that action anymore that I
[1:20:26] used to have and it told him he said
[1:20:28] that man I knew that I was
[1:20:30] saved oh Church it'll change you it
[1:20:33] changes more than our dress it changes
[1:20:36] more than just going to church or saying
[1:20:38] I believe the message but it changes who
[1:20:40] we
[1:20:42] are he and he goes back and takes that
[1:20:45] to the demons and the swine he and he
[1:20:47] said they they said don't torment us
[1:20:49] before the time comes but if you'll cast
[1:20:51] us out look at the meanness of them the
[1:20:54] wicked wickedness he said if you're
[1:20:56] going to cast us out don't let us just

[1:21:09] said that's that we want to do we want

[1:26:13] listening to them swine
[1:26:16] demons right but if you're not careful
[1:26:19] they'll drive you completely insane
[1:26:21] because temper is the first stage of
[1:26:22] insanity every every time you lose your

[1:26:33] a spirit not even swine could live with
[1:26:36] it's
[1:26:37] Insanity the Bible says wherefore my
[1:26:39] beloved Brethren let every man be swift
[1:26:41] to hear so to speak so to wrath for the
[1:26:44] wrath of man worketh not the
[1:26:45] righteousness of God are yall okay still
[1:26:47] out there everybody breathing everybody
[1:26:49] all
[1:26:51] right Jonah's all right
[1:26:55] for the wrath of man worketh not the
[1:26:56] righteousness of God being angry is
[1:26:58] normal living in that condition is
[1:27:02] not you're going to get mad sometimes
[1:27:04] you're going to get you're going to get
[1:27:06] heated up but it's not normal again the
[1:27:08] same thing as Reuben remember if you're
[1:27:10] that kind of a person you got to learn
[1:27:12] to turn the heat down right right and if
[1:27:15] you're that kind of a person like Levi
[1:27:17] or like Simeon you need to learn to turn
[1:27:19] the heat down be angry and sin not come
[1:27:21] to the water and be healed of your
[1:27:23] insanity
[1:27:24] brandom talks about it he said when the
[1:27:26] when the when the deer would be escaping
[1:27:29] The Wolves they would get bitten by the
[1:27:30] wild dogs he said they'd run for a
[1:27:32] source of water if they could get to the
[1:27:34] water they'd be okay listen to me church
[1:27:36] if you've been bitten by Temper if
[1:27:38] you've been bitten by demon of anger you
[1:27:40] got to run to the water and say Lord I'm
[1:27:43] sorry repent of that thing get to the
[1:27:45] water and let the presence of God heal
[1:27:47] you amen
[1:27:51] good we don't have to live like that
[1:27:55] The Temper carried on through look look
[1:27:57] at what Levi did now we talked about
[1:27:59] Simeon look what Levi did The Temper I
[1:28:01] don't have time to get everything about
[1:28:02] levite tonight we'll get to it maybe
[1:28:04] next Wednesday but the temper carried
[1:28:07] through to Moses who was a
[1:28:09] levite who took his own things in his
[1:28:11] own hands in Egypt right you wonder
[1:28:14] where Moses got his temper from he come
[1:28:16] by it
[1:28:18] honestly and and all he had to show for
[1:28:20] it was a stinking corpse a dead Egyptian
[1:28:24] in the sand and brother Brandon said
[1:28:27] after taking the situation in his own
[1:28:28] hand he found out he was a total failure
[1:28:31] and run from the presence of pharaoh and
[1:28:33] the presence of God was a stranger for
[1:28:35] 40 years way back and he married an
[1:28:37] Ethiopian girl and so she had a lot of
[1:28:40] temper and Moses had a lot of temper
[1:28:42] that was his trouble he said I just
[1:28:43] imagine things wasn't so peaceful back
[1:28:45] there on the back of the desert at times
[1:28:47] but God gave it to him oh wow what did
[1:28:50] God give him his wife who also had a
[1:28:52] temper yeah how do you fight fire with
[1:28:57] fire
[1:28:59] right so you he had a temper and she had
[1:29:02] a temper and and together God was
[1:29:05] working on him he said if you think you
[1:29:07] you married a woman has a little temper
[1:29:08] maybe God's trying to tame you down a
[1:29:11] little it's not only redheads that have
[1:29:13] temper is't that right someone ought to
[1:29:16] say
[1:29:18] Amen see God's trying to tame you down a
[1:29:20] little and vice versa in numbers 20
[1:29:24] uh but I'm so glad you know Moses now
[1:29:27] watch Moses and again we have the new
[1:29:30] birth right it's a different age that we
[1:29:32] live in because we have the spirit of
[1:29:34] Christ that controls us but you watch
[1:29:35] Moses and you realize though he met the
[1:29:38] burning bush the pillar of fire and and
[1:29:40] and and it changed him and yet in the
[1:29:43] flesh he still had a flesh to deal with
[1:29:47] right he had a supernatural experience
[1:29:49] with God but he still had to deal with
[1:29:50] his flesh and so in Numbers Chapter 20
[1:29:52] you find Moses and a Aaron gathered a
[1:29:55] the congregation together and God had
[1:29:56] told him he said Moses because the
[1:29:58] people were complaining he said about no
[1:30:00] water he said speak to the Rock speak to
[1:30:04] the Rock and bring forth water and Moses
[1:30:07] gathered the congregation together and
[1:30:08] said you talk about a sermon he said
[1:30:11] here now you
[1:30:14] rebels and preachers think they can say
[1:30:16] whatever they want to but you don't get
[1:30:18] to just say what you want to
[1:30:21] say God help us today you don't get to
[1:30:23] just act any way you want to act from
[1:30:25] the pulpit cuz you'll answer for it to
[1:30:27] God he said here now you rebels must we
[1:30:30] fetch you water out of this rock and
[1:30:32] listen God backed him
[1:30:34] up Moses lifted up his hand with his Rod
[1:30:37] he smoke the rock twice and the water
[1:30:38] come out abundantly and the congregation
[1:30:40] drank and their Beast also but the Lord
[1:30:43] spoke to Moses and Aaron remember who
[1:30:45] they were
[1:30:46] Levites because you believe me not to
[1:30:50] sanctify in the eyes of the children of
[1:30:51] Israel therefore you shall not bring
[1:30:54] this congregation into the land which I
[1:30:56] have given them brother Bram taught us
[1:30:58] that Satan tempted Moses at his weak
[1:31:00] spot and got him to break the
[1:31:03] Commandments that's what he said he said
[1:31:04] he tempted him at his weak spot and
[1:31:06] caused him to break the Commandments he
[1:31:08] said which was a type of the levite
[1:31:10] priesthood being broken because God had
[1:31:12] another priesthood greater now we're
[1:31:15] going to find Jesus in it he had another
[1:31:18] another priest said greater than the
[1:31:19] levite priesthood greater than
[1:31:22] Moses are you with me now
[1:31:25] what was it Jesus in Hebrews 6:20 tells
[1:31:27] us he was the high priest after the
[1:31:29] order of MDC not after the levite order
[1:31:32] but brother random taught us that when
[1:31:34] he showed the natural priesthood would
[1:31:36] be broken when he come against Jesus in
[1:31:38] the wilderness he said this isn't
[1:31:41] Moses right this isn't been PR this
[1:31:44] isn't some some normal man this was God
[1:31:46] in flesh what was it God was making it
[1:31:50] known that Moses wasn't God Moses was
[1:31:52] just a prophet of God and we're not God
[1:31:54] we're just the children of God but yet
[1:31:57] he said when when he come up against
[1:31:58] Jesus he realized he tried to tempt him
[1:32:00] at his weak spot his hunger and Jesus
[1:32:03] would not bow to it but he said it's
[1:32:05] also written and he defeated him by the
[1:32:08] word oh my which show that he was
[1:32:10] greater than Moses are you with me now
[1:32:12] he's greater oh my that's who we lift up
[1:32:15] today we don't preach a man we preach
[1:32:17] Jesus Christ the word the great one who
[1:32:20] with stood the Temptation and did no sin
[1:32:23] he he was MDC was greater than Levi
[1:32:26] because come on church I'm just going to
[1:32:28] hold you a few minutes longer but you
[1:32:30] you're with me I I'm sure now look MDC
[1:32:33] was greater than Levi because Levi paid
[1:32:35] tithes to MZ or or to mzc in Abraham
[1:32:39] remember Hebrews tells us that so Levi
[1:32:43] Levi though he would not have an
[1:32:44] allotment but he would be called to be a
[1:32:46] priest but yet Christ would be from a
[1:32:48] greater priesthood oh my he's greater
[1:32:51] than Levi greater than Moses
[1:32:54] and serve the Tabernacle of the Lord now
[1:32:57] in numbers 148 he talks about the tribe
[1:32:59] of Levi and I'll just introduce this to
[1:33:01] you and maybe we'll get to more of it
[1:33:04] next Wednesday the Lord willing he said
[1:33:06] for the Lord has spoken to Moses saying
[1:33:07] only Thou shalt not number the tribe of
[1:33:09] Levi neither take the Su of them among
[1:33:11] the children of Israel remember the
[1:33:13] prophecy was they would be scattered
[1:33:15] Simeon was scattered and never come to
[1:33:17] nothing
[1:33:19] yeah but Levi was scattered and God said
[1:33:21] I'm going to use
[1:33:24] now listen to me I'm going to use that
[1:33:28] temper I'm going to use that
[1:33:33] zealousness come on church I'm going to
[1:33:35] use that quickness that
[1:33:38] sharpness I'm going to use it for my
[1:33:41] purpose Hallelujah he needed somebody
[1:33:46] who would take a stand for the word so
[1:33:48] he said you're not going to have an
[1:33:49] allotment with the people of is with the
[1:33:51] children of Israel he said but thou sh
[1:33:54] appoint the Levites over the Tabernacle
[1:33:55] of testimony over all the vessels over
[1:33:57] all the things that belong to it they
[1:33:59] shall encamp around the Tabernacle when
[1:34:01] the Tabernacle sets forth the levite
[1:34:02] shall take it down when the Tabernacle
[1:34:04] to be pitched the Levites shall set it
[1:34:05] up and the stranger that cometh n shall
[1:34:07] be put to death they were
[1:34:09] dispersed they were they were under that
[1:34:12] prophecy but in that they were called to
[1:34:16] serve God became their
[1:34:20] portion oh my now look at Deuteronomy
[1:34:23] chapter 33 and: 8 remember the Moses
[1:34:27] says nothing about Simeon but about Levi
[1:34:30] he said let thy thumb and thy urum be
[1:34:32] with thy Holy One whom thou did prove at
[1:34:34] Massa and with whom thou did strive at
[1:34:36] the Waters of merbah who said to his
[1:34:39] father and to his mother I have not seen
[1:34:41] him now why remember daythan and abam
[1:34:45] were reubenites remember but Kora was
[1:34:48] also there Kora was a
[1:34:50] levite and they should they could have
[1:34:52] sided with cor over Moses but they said
[1:34:56] no remember what happened when Kora and
[1:34:58] Dayan and abam left and and said who are
[1:35:00] you to be a prince Among Us and Moses
[1:35:02] said who is on the Lord's Side let him
[1:35:04] come into me and all the Levites went
[1:35:06] over to
[1:35:07] Moses right except for Kora and his
[1:35:09] family and so Moses said who said to his
[1:35:12] father to his mother have not seen him
[1:35:13] neither did he acknowledge his Brethren
[1:35:15] nor knew his own children for they have
[1:35:17] observed Thy word and kept thy Covenant
[1:35:19] he needed somebody with a Zeal now I
[1:35:22] want you to understand God don't just
[1:35:24] take all the temper out of us he don't
[1:35:26] take all the all the quickness out of us
[1:35:28] all the Zeal out of us because there's
[1:35:29] got to be somebody that'll that'll be
[1:35:31] quick to do the right thing but it's got
[1:35:34] to be controlled by the word so the
[1:35:37] children of Simeon did not controll it
[1:35:40] by the word and they become almost a
[1:35:42] nothing tribe although again they were
[1:35:45] stored in the Millennium but the
[1:35:47] children uh the children of of Levi
[1:35:52] actually become the the Serv vants of
[1:35:54] God and a type of the ministry today
[1:35:57] right why because they were sered God
[1:36:01] with all of their heart whatever they
[1:36:03] joined with remember their name meant
[1:36:05] joining whatever they joined with they
[1:36:08] joined completely with it was like glue
[1:36:11] like adhesive and when they join
[1:36:13] themselves to the Lord oh I like to see
[1:36:15] a person that'll sell out join
[1:36:17] themselves to the Lord and when this
[1:36:18] type of person joins themselves to the
[1:36:20] lord they're going to go all out right
[1:36:23] they're not going to they're not going
[1:36:24] to be a Halfway Christian they're going
[1:36:25] to serve God with all of their heart and
[1:36:27] that's what God calls into the
[1:36:31] ministry I know it's real quiet but just
[1:36:34] it takes that it takes a certain amount
[1:36:36] of zeal a certain amount of
[1:36:40] crazy come on Church a certain amount of
[1:36:44] I'm not going to look at what nobody
[1:36:46] says to take
[1:36:48] it because sometimes good men get in the
[1:36:51] ministry and they're not called for it
[1:36:53] they end up broken and
[1:36:55] bitter good men become pastors that
[1:36:57] aren't called to do it and they end up
[1:36:59] broken and
[1:37:01] bitter because they just can't handle it
[1:37:05] but God needs somebody with a Zeal I
[1:37:08] believe all of us are called to be
[1:37:09] spiritual
[1:37:10] priests and at some level we're all
[1:37:13] called to have a Zeal for God not just
[1:37:15] the preachers but every one of us are
[1:37:16] called to be Kings and Priests are you
[1:37:19] with me I got five more
[1:37:21] minutes believe it or not I have five
[1:37:23] minutes
[1:37:25] s and he said they shall teach look at
[1:37:30] verse 13 they shall teach Jacob thy
[1:37:32] judgments and Israel thy law they they
[1:37:34] shall put incense before thee and a
[1:37:35] whole burnt sacrifice upon thine altar
[1:37:38] bless Lord his substance and accept the
[1:37:41] work of his hands Smite through the
[1:37:42] loins of them that rise against him of
[1:37:44] them that hate him that they rise not
[1:37:47] again now why the DraStic change between
[1:37:50] Genesis and Deuteronomy God needed
[1:37:52] somebody who would be sell us for the
[1:37:54] house of the Lord see Jesus never lost
[1:37:57] his
[1:37:58] temper he didn't have no spirits that
[1:38:01] come from the swine talking in his ear
[1:38:03] and him give in to him are you with me
[1:38:05] now he never did that but yet he picked
[1:38:08] up a cat of Ninetails and drove the
[1:38:10] people from the temple now I got to I
[1:38:12] got to present to you the whole word of
[1:38:14] God tonight church we want to be like
[1:38:16] Jesus but that's also within the realm
[1:38:18] of possibility I've said before in our
[1:38:20] flesh we would sin doing that but we've
[1:38:23] got to under the the influence of the
[1:38:25] word in our Zeal not the influence of a
[1:38:28] church or a denomination or to represent
[1:38:30] ourselves but to represent the Lord look
[1:38:32] at the story of Finos and closing when
[1:38:34] the when the error of B peor be to come
[1:38:37] out and balum said we're all the same
[1:38:39] you remember that was the doctrine of
[1:38:40] balum and they come out and they begin
[1:38:42] to draw people away to them and and it
[1:38:46] come to a point where uh the uh the
[1:38:49] people were intermingling with the women
[1:38:52] from the mo Bish women and it was a
[1:38:55] great sin and a plague struck the
[1:38:57] children of
[1:38:58] Israel and one of uh well Aaron's sons
[1:39:03] Finos he took matters in his own hands
[1:39:07] just like Moses did just like Levi did
[1:39:12] he was a
[1:39:13] levite but he didn't do it to defend
[1:39:18] himself he didn't do it to defend his
[1:39:20] family he did it to save others amen are
[1:39:24] you with me now you see the balance of
[1:39:26] it sometimes you you got to get stirred
[1:39:28] church sometimes you got to wake up and
[1:39:30] realize you got to fight fight a good
[1:39:32] fight of faith and fight the battle
[1:39:34] against the enemy sometimes you got to
[1:39:36] stand for the word but you don't do it
[1:39:38] just for yourself you do it to save
[1:39:40] people's
[1:39:42] lives so
[1:39:44] Finos when the horrible sin was being
[1:39:46] committed Finos goes to a tent and he
[1:39:50] actually takes a javelin and drives it
[1:39:52] through the offending
[1:39:54] parties it's
[1:39:56] brutal it's
[1:39:58] terrible but God commended him for
[1:40:01] it why he didn't do it for himself
[1:40:06] numbers 2510 the Lord spake to Moses
[1:40:08] saying Finos the son of eler the son of
[1:40:10] Aaron the priest had turned my wrath
[1:40:12] away from the children of Israel while
[1:40:14] he was zealous for my sake among them
[1:40:17] that I consume not the children of
[1:40:18] Israel in my jealousy wherefore say
[1:40:21] behold I give it unto him my Covenant of
[1:40:24] Peace listen he shall have at his seat
[1:40:26] after him even the Covenant of an
[1:40:27] everlasting priesthood because he was
[1:40:29] zealous for his God and he made an
[1:40:31] atonement for the children of
[1:40:33] Israel that I'm just zealous he said I
[1:40:35] know you think I'm a hard I know you
[1:40:37] think I hate women and things like that
[1:40:39] he said but I'm zealous for the church
[1:40:41] I'm zealous for the word of God I want
[1:40:43] to see things done right I'm glad we had
[1:40:45] a prophet that was zealous in our day
[1:40:47] that was willing to to to Smite that
[1:40:50] thing are you with me now I'm glad God
[1:40:52] called somebody like that and sometimes
[1:40:54] it takes that in our own
[1:40:56] lives willing just do away with sin cut
[1:40:59] it off get rid of
[1:41:01] it and serve God with all your
[1:41:04] heart was zealous you made an
[1:41:06] atonement but now watch this look how
[1:41:09] perfectly the Bible dovetails together
[1:41:12] the name of the Israelite that was slain
[1:41:14] even that was slain within the median
[1:41:15] itish woman was zimy or slain with with
[1:41:18] the medish woman was zimy the son of seu
[1:41:21] a prince of a chief house among the
[1:41:25] Simeon
[1:41:26] ites he wasn't joined with Simeon any
[1:41:30] longer in fact he was actually he was
[1:41:34] actually fighting with god with Moses
[1:41:37] with the word against the simonit now
[1:41:40] look look at the difference between the
[1:41:42] two tribes the simonit went along with
[1:41:45] the error of
[1:41:46] bpor and they almost
[1:41:49] disappeared but the Levites were zealous
[1:41:51] for the word of the Lord and though they
[1:41:53] did didn't have a land with boundaries
[1:41:57] God became their portion and we've been
[1:41:59] called to be Kings and Priests we don't
[1:42:01] have a physical land with boundaries but
[1:42:04] we have a place in God we have a word
[1:42:06] that we serve we have a spiritual
[1:42:09] offering that we can give of sacri let's
[1:42:11] be zealous about it let's be zealous
[1:42:13] with our worship let's be zealous with
[1:42:15] our with our praise let's be zealous
[1:42:17] with our preaching let's take it and say
[1:42:19] Lord I'm willing to do whatever you want
[1:42:21] me to do as means misss
[1:42:24] come the Bible says as many as I love I
[1:42:27] rebuke and Chase and this is at the end
[1:42:28] of the lean Church age he said be
[1:42:31] zealous therefore and repent brand said
[1:42:33] we don't need a Zeal for
[1:42:35] denomination we need a Zeal to say I'm
[1:42:38] wrong he said that's the Cry of the hour
[1:42:41] oh would that be our cry tonight if I've
[1:42:43] been wrong if I've let the devil
[1:42:45] influence me in some way if i' if I've
[1:42:47] lost my temper let me have a Zeal like
[1:42:49] Finos to say I'm wrong and if the sin is
[1:42:52] right here let me be willing to go into
[1:42:54] the tent and get rid of
[1:42:56] it even if it's even if it's right here
[1:42:59] as we would be in ourselves maybe maybe
[1:43:02] a type in ourselves of both Simeon and
[1:43:05] Levi and if if the sin was right here in
[1:43:08] our own flesh we'd be willing to get rid
[1:43:10] of it are you with me now that that we'd
[1:43:14] be willing to be zealous for the word of
[1:43:16] God oh I trust that God's called
[1:43:18] somebody I believe he has I believe he's
[1:43:20] called some preachers in our hour to be
[1:43:22] zealous of the word to be zealous for
[1:43:24] the message that we not just give in to
[1:43:26] whatever somebody says but they want to
[1:43:28] find out for themselves what God said
[1:43:31] listen they were both under the same
[1:43:32] blessing and it was and it was
[1:43:34] completely negative but God saw
[1:43:37] something in Levi would stand for the
[1:43:39] word and so he called
[1:43:41] Moses oh
[1:43:43] my I I want to ask you as they begin to
[1:43:45] play as we're being placed in the
[1:43:49] land who would you want to be identified
[1:43:52] with
[1:43:54] I want to be identified with
[1:43:56] Levi with the tribe of Levi though they
[1:43:58] both started the
[1:44:01] same let me have a Zeal for the
[1:44:06] word and for the right
[1:44:08] reasons not because somebody got at me
[1:44:11] on Facebook or somebody got at me on in
[1:44:14] the church and said I'm going to get
[1:44:16] them back I'm going to search the
[1:44:17] scriptures and find my
[1:44:21] retribution God hates that
[1:44:24] he hates that
[1:44:27] spirit so I've told people I don't want
[1:44:31] retribution somebody leaves here and I
[1:44:33] mean this honestly I'm not just saying
[1:44:34] it if people would see in my heart I
[1:44:37] mean this honestly if somebody leaves I
[1:44:39] don't want bad for them I want good for
[1:44:41] them I don't want retribution I want
[1:44:44] them to be so blessed in their
[1:44:47] lives because I want to see everybody
[1:44:49] make
[1:44:50] it and and if I must strike sin Let Me
[1:44:54] strike because it's because of the
[1:44:56] plague in the camp to get rid of the
[1:44:59] plague in the camp to let people live
[1:45:02] let me be zealous for the church zealous
[1:45:06] for the house of God zealous for my
[1:45:08] family come on men we got to be zealous
[1:45:10] for what God has given us to protect be
[1:45:13] zealous for the for the people God has
[1:45:15] given us say Lord I'll do what it takes
[1:45:18] I'll work what whatever you have me to
[1:45:20] do I'll do whatever it is you want me to
[1:45:22] do
[1:45:23] I want to be zealous for my children to
[1:45:25] make sure that they're raised in the
[1:45:27] house of God I want to be zealous for my
[1:45:29] family be radical be willing to be sold
[1:45:32] out completely be willing in the church
[1:45:35] to raise my hands be willing to shout if
[1:45:37] that's what you want be willing to cry
[1:45:39] if that's what you want let me be
[1:45:41] zealous not for Retribution not for
[1:45:43] personal gain not because somebody
[1:45:45] wronged me in some way but a Zeal to
[1:45:47] save people from the plague of sin Let
[1:45:50] Me Be zealous like that hope that's your
[1:45:53] desire tonight oh I want that maybe in
[1:45:56] the past you've had a temper or things
[1:45:58] have happened you know you've got the
[1:45:59] holy ghost that things are different now
[1:46:02] maybe you could let God use what he saw
[1:46:04] in you when he called you let him use it
[1:46:07] for his own Glory not to be a critic or
[1:46:10] to be bitter let him use
[1:46:14] that to better the
[1:46:17] church to keep you on edge if need be as
[1:46:21] brother Brandon said I didn't understand
[1:46:22] why I always always the target if he got
[1:46:24] a little bit off I get so nervous
[1:46:26] because God had called him for a
[1:46:27] particular hour in a time when the
[1:46:30] denominations would be have gotten off
[1:46:32] the word and God called him to to shoot
[1:46:34] straight and tell us the truth and I
[1:46:37] believe God called him for a reason
[1:46:39] let's have a Zeal for the word today I'm
[1:46:41] going to say what God said I'm going to
[1:46:42] believe the message I'm going to live
[1:46:44] for somebody
[1:46:46] else willing to forsake all others to
[1:46:49] cleave only to God to be United Like
[1:46:51] Glue with God and his message to stand
[1:46:55] for the message of there no matter what
[1:46:56] anybody says about it let me have a Zeal
[1:46:59] for it is that your desire tonight if it
[1:47:01] is with your head bowed and your eye
[1:47:03] closed would you raise your hands to him
[1:47:05] and just talk to him for a
[1:47:09] minute I know it's very different but I
[1:47:11] just couldn't get away from this and we
[1:47:14] didn't crat the service the surface of
[1:47:17] Levi and what he meant what his tribe
[1:47:20] meant but I don't want my temper
[1:47:24] to be a temper
[1:47:25] influenced by those swine
[1:47:28] demons I don't want to lose it I don't
[1:47:31] want to throw
[1:47:33] fits the devil makes you throw a fit
[1:47:36] every time it's the

[1:47:52] and and anger at my children surely I
[1:47:54] can raise my voice in

[1:48:01] raising it at my wife or raising at my
[1:48:03] children or raising at somebody who I
[1:48:05] disagree with and have a temper fit with
[1:48:08] let me raise it in Praise say Lord You
