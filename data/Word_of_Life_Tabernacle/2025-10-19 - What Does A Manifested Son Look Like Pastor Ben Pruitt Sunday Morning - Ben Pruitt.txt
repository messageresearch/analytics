Would you just raise your hand today and believe that God's going to take care of every need and he knows all about it this morning. He's able. He's able to do that. Heavenly Father, Lord, I I'm insufficient in myself to care for the needs of the people in the way that I I should, Lord, but I know that you're able. I pray, God, that you'd reach down this morning. Lord, you to heal the brokenhearted, touch those that are hurting, Lord. Lord, may your anointing flow, oh God, from your word, and may it strengthen our lives and satisfy the thirst on the inside, Lord. May it heal the sick, oh God. May you may you make yourself known, oh God, mighty in battle, I pray you'd grant it today, Lord. Every need, physical, financial, whatever it is, Lord, I pray you'd meet it today. Move me out of the way. If there ever was a time, Lord, that I needed you, it was this morning. And I pray, God, that you'd move me out of the way and speak to your people. We pray in Jesus' name. Amen. God bless you this morning. Romans chapter 8 and verse 818. And then we'll read from Ephesians 4:11. Romans 8:18 and Ephesians 4:11. It's good to be in church this morning. I know there's several missing. Some are hunting and and some are uh gone and different reasons. Brother Joel's traveling back from Bethl camp. Be praying for him. Brother David got sick this morning. Unable to be here. Brother David White. So be praying for him this morning. Romans chapter 8 verse 18. For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be I like that shall be revealed in us. For the earnest expectation of the creature waitth for the manifestation of the sons of God. And then Ephesians chapter 4 and 11 says, "He gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ, till we all come in the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the son of God unto a perfect man." In other words, a fully grown man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. Amen. I pray the Lord would add his blessing to the word. You may be seated this morning. I want to speak to you this morning on what does a manifested son look like? What does a manifested son look like? I think we get an idea. Thank you, brother Danny. We get an idea in our in our minds of what a manifested son would be as if it would be some type of superman. It would be some type of of uh of uh a a god man. And and and it is. And yet we get this idea that it would be without failure, without frailty, without humanity. And yet we know when Jesus come to the earth, he didn't come that way. But he come in a human body. And he come in a body that could get sick and could and could be tempted and and and could get worried and could get stressed out and could get angry. Yet he never sinned. And I'm so thankful for that example that we have today. And yet in ourselves, we even come uh in a way that that the word is in us. We believe that. We believe that that we're part of the word. Yet uh we're we're human and we tend to make mistakes and we tend to have problems and and we're not even as he was he was virgin born. We are not. And so we come into the world in a in a manner that every man is born of a woman's a few days and full of trouble. Comes into the world with a sinful nature speaking lies. And and so we we have come into a world that uh we carry a body of humiliation with us. And and I know everybody wants to think, well, I I I believe that I could speak to the storm. And I believe that you could. I believe that's the hour that we're living in and the potentials that we have as children of God. And yet many times in in doing that, we look at that example and say, "Well, I I want to speak to storms." And yet, we have a hard time getting ourselves out of bed and getting to church. And come on, church. We we're human beings. We're not we're not some type of a of a Superman. And we we need to get rid of that idea in our in our heart of what that will be. We're going to carry these bodies of humiliation until the moment that we leave here, right? And that's the fullness of our adoption is the change of these bodies when we become fullgrown sons of God. And yet there's a place that we can come to under the message of the hour that we do have a a control and a do a domination if you will over our surroundings, over our flesh, over sin, over those things. That's a place that we're called to that we can come to. And yet this body is still a body of death. It's still a body of sin. It's still a body that'll that'll plague you until the day that you die. But remember, when you get rid of this body, there's already another body waiting. This isn't even the real you, but there's a real you waiting somewhere. &gt;&gt; And we've got to remember that we're we're we're only here we're here as as for a purpose. And I guess if you would just, you know, the the the most uh example, the best example that we have of what a manifested son would look like in this age in a in a a body of a human being, a redeemed body would be brother Brandham, &gt;&gt; right? Because he did come to that place where the Lord allowed him to speak a squirrel into existence. &gt;&gt; And some of y'all say, "Well, I got as much of that as, you know, Brother Brandham does." Well, why are you still using corn then to attract deer? &gt;&gt; I went in Walmart the other day and and and everybody there was buying corn. I thought they're keeping the economy alive. This guy's buying corn to attract deer. And yet we say we're manifested sons of God living in the age of adoption and we are. &gt;&gt; Are you with me church? And yet, brother Brandham come to that. And yet, you look at brother Brandham and what we failed to see is what he had to go through &gt;&gt; to get to that place. &gt;&gt; See, God used that vessel, but he lost his baby. He lost his wife. He went through some things. &gt;&gt; He'd been through some heartaches, been through some trials. It wasn't always easy in the Brandom home, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Huh? You say, "Well, a prophet's home would always be would always be stable." And no, I'll take you back to Moses in the Old Testament. Moses and Zapora had a lot of fights and had a lot of trouble and a lot of strife and a lot of struggle. And and so a prophet's home isn't necessarily easy. It's not an easy place to live. A preacher's home isn't necessarily easy. I I had someone one time tell me, and you forgive me this morning, we're going to be very real today. So I I I had someone tell me one time in counseling and they told me said, "Brother Ben, you don't understand because your marriage has always been perfect." And I laughed at them. &gt;&gt; I didn't intend to, but I chuckled because I thought, "God, if they only knew how how how close that I had come to giving up so many times." And I'm sure I'd push my wife to the brink. But but but but we we're adults. We chose to do something different and and come together and do what's right. and and and we did that because of the influence of the word of God in our life. And and that's what manifested sons are not sons without trouble. Manifested sons and daughters of God are not people with no trouble in their lives or their homes or in the church, but pe manifested sons and daughters of God are people who who make the decision that they need to make when the time comes. They stand for the word and when it's revealed to them what to do. When they make a mistake, they get back up again. They don't quit. Come on, church. It's somebody who won't quit. Somebody who won't give up. Somebody who won't give in to the devil. How many of those have we got this morning? You still live in a body of humiliation. But you don't have to give into it. You don't have to give up when the going gets rough. That's a time for you to get going and get moving and begin to move on in faith and believe what God said. Anybody can believe God when everything's going good. But what about when it's rough? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. You see men of God, &gt;&gt; men of God who have come to a place of maturity in their lives and you look at them and you think, "Oh, you know, they're just on a different plane. They just haven't struggled like I've struggled." You don't know that. That's right. &gt;&gt; You see people that have come even in our church, some of these older deacons and some of our men that have come to a and not to sight our younger deacons, but our older deacons have been around so long that they, you know, you look at them and think, well, they must have been Superman. But you don't know what it took. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You don't know the process of making these men &gt;&gt; and their wives. &gt;&gt; I'm being very real with us this morning. &gt;&gt; See, we think that a manifested son would be somebody who who just had it all easy and they always made the right decisions. And no, but it's somebody God will deal with. See, he deals with us as sons. Paul says, "Are you going through a struggle or a trial or tribulation in your life?" It's because he's dealing with you as a son or daughter of God. And we ought to thank God every minute for that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But just remember what you are. You got to start somewhere. We don't become fullborn full-blown sons of God overnight. I know. I know. We We must be born again. We'll get into that this morning. You've got to be born again. There's got to be a change. But you don't you start at the bottom. You don't start at the top. Don't give up because of where you're at right now. Keep pressing the battle. keep moving forward. &gt;&gt; The problem is people are proud and they think that the whole church will look down on them if they admit to having gone through something. And the truth is the whole church has been through it. &gt;&gt; Cuz people are human. &gt;&gt; Everybody wants to speak to the storm, myself included. And sometimes we do and God vindicates it and blesses it. Everyone wants to curse the fig tree and Jesus did. But do we have the character of Christ &gt;&gt; there to control those things? &gt;&gt; Amen. And we've said it many times, but some of us, even us preachers, if we really had the power to speak people out of existence, &gt;&gt; would speak all the wrong people out of existence. &gt;&gt; Now, come on. If you really had knew and you really believe you had the power to speak somebody out of existence, how many times would you have done it? That's right. &gt;&gt; If you had the power to call 10,000 angels and deliver you from trouble, we believe angels surround us. Did you know that &gt;&gt; the Bible says they they compass about those who are they surround those who who serve the Lord. That's right. &gt;&gt; We believe that today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon says if you can see beyond the veil of this flesh, you'd see angels at their position at every pew. And and yet we we realize that that's the case. And but if you had the power to call 10,000 angels, would you deliver yourself from the cross? And the answer for most of us is yes. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I would get myself out of this trouble. I'd just quit. But the exit is not always the easy way out. That's right. &gt;&gt; Right. The closest exit is not always the easy way out. If you guys go out this door, that's not the easy way out of the church. &gt;&gt; We had a prayer line one time and somebody headed out that door after they got prayed for around that time. And that is not the easy way out of the church because there's rocks out there. There's a hill out there and if you're out there at night in the dark, you might get hurt. &gt;&gt; You probably will be. The closest exit is not the easy way out of your problem. But we need to get to a place of maturity until we're not looking for exits, but we're saying, "Lord, whatever you're dealing with me on in my life, let me accept that. Let me let me let me be able to deal with that. Let me let me submit myself to your will and to your way." &gt;&gt; How many can say amen to that this morning? &gt;&gt; See, the greatest anointing that was ever on a man was not a man that was screaming and and shouting. Brother Brandham said the greatest anointing that was ever on a man was when Jesus stood there that day and said this day this scripture is fulfilled. He sat down and began to teach the people. Brother Brandham said the anointing is not emotion. The anointing listen is supreme power in control &gt;&gt; knowing I love this exactly what and how. And what I really need so many times, Sister Karen, and and I know this is my in myself is what I struggle with as a pastor is what to say when and how to act when, &gt;&gt; right? And that's where we fail the most is in what to do and what to say and how to act and when to make a phone call and when to when to when to be abrupt and there's times we need to be we need to drive a point home and there's times we need to be careful and what to say and how. That's what the anointing is. And I can't explain it to you, but there's something about being in the pulpit. Sometimes you can deal with things in a way that you can't deal with even in person because you're under the anointing. And the Holy Spirit helps you to speak to a situation maybe that you don't even know about, but he's helping you do it anyway. It's supreme power and control, knowing exactly what and how. He said, "And that's what's here." Oh, I love that. That's what's here. Second Peter chapter 1. Let's turn there this morning because I've already used uh so much time in introduction. We'll just go on through uh this morning. We're just going to try to get to a portion of this. If you want to draw a direct equation between adoption, what we've been talking about is manifested sons. What would a manifested son look like? Well, he'd be the stature of a perfect man or a mature man. He'd be the image of Jesus Christ. He'd have the character of Christ. He would be a partaker of the divine nature. And Peter explains that in second Peter chapter 1. Simon Peter a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ. To them that have obtained I like that that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our savior Jesus Christ. Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord according as his divine power hath given unto us all things. Someone say all things. that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue. So there's something that the divine power hath given us. He's given us all all things. So we have it and yet he says add to it. Now he said whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature. How do I uh partake of the divine nature? By faith in the word. The great and precious promises is the word. And by believing the word, I can have faith to believe it. I and to accept it and it can come. I was uh listening last night to brother Donnie Reagan preach and he made a remarkable remarkable statement out at Bethl. I was watching to see if I could see Joel and the boys out there. And I I listened to that. He made a remarkable statement. He said it, you know, it's so easy for a person to catch an evil spirit. All they have to do is disbelieve, &gt;&gt; right? And if that's true, then what about on the other side? &gt;&gt; How how easy would it be to to receive the Holy Spirit if you really believe the word? &gt;&gt; We have exceeding great and precious promises. And by these we are partakers of the divine nature, &gt;&gt; right? We make it difficult sometimes, but it's actually quite easy. What we've got to do is say yes, &gt;&gt; right? Yes. This way, right? If you if you if you agree with the word, then oh God, that that makes things a whole lot easier because you're not going to cross the word. And if you know that in your heart, God can bless that and can and can give you the Holy Spirit. Now, and brother Bram tells us that full obedience entitles us to the token, &gt;&gt; right? And and so that's simply you say, "What is obedience?" Well, obedience is saying amen to every word. It doesn't mean you can do it on your own. You can't do it on your own. You can't quit smoking, quit drinking, quit quit running around with women. You can't do that on your own. You need the Holy Ghost to be able to do that. And and yet, how do you get the Holy Ghost? By saying amen to the word, by being obedient to the word. Do what you know to do. Walk with him in every in the way that you've been called to walk with him, and he'll lead you into great and promised land. Now look, he leads you into the fullness of the adoption. Now he said he's given us great and precious promises, precious promises. So I think the number one job of a preacher is to wave those promises over the people, right? Is to make sure that they understand that these promises are for you, right? These promises are for you. Not just healing, not just salvation, but everything the word says that you can be, that's what you can be. And so when God says something, then those great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust or sinful desire. Brother Brand said, look here. He said, you escaped it. See who it's to? It's to the church. them who are in Christ has been exalted above these things. Not he exalted himself, but Christ brought him up. Christ brought him up. And so I know there's folks that believe the stature of a perfect man is something you work on, you work on, you work on, and one day you get enough faith and then you get enough virtue and eventually if you work on them all and God's satisfied with it, then he gives you the Holy Ghost. But it's the Holy Ghost from the beginning. that began a good work, &gt;&gt; right? And we need to be we need to be clear about that today. It's the Holy Ghost from the beginning. It's the Holy Ghost that justifies you. &gt;&gt; It's the Holy Ghost that sanctifies you. &gt;&gt; It's the Holy Ghost that fills you. &gt;&gt; Right? So, it's the work of the Holy Ghost all the way through. God doesn't respond to our effort, but to our obedience to the word. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? So um the B said that's how we know we passed from death to life. He talked about a woman who got up and testified and she said I'm not what I want to be. She said but I'm not what I used to be. &gt;&gt; And and he responds to that. Brother Ram tells that story. He said that's how we know we passed from death unto life. &gt;&gt; That's pretty simple, isn't it? Some of y'all struggle with, oh, do I have the Holy Ghost? Do I have this, that, or the other? That's how we know we passed from death unto life. I'm not maybe what I want to be. He's not finished working on me yet, but I'm not what I used to be. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said, we look back to the pit where we was heed from. Oh, a year ago, it looked a lot different. 10 years ago, it looked a lot different. For some of you, 40, 50 years ago, you looked a lot different. But you're different today than you was then. You're better today, Sister Stephanie, than you was then. Why? Because you've been brought from death into life. You may not even even realize what happened at first, but God's been bringing you out. &gt;&gt; Look to the pit where we was heed from. See, we're not what we want to be. We're not even what we ought to be. But one thing we're thankful for, we're not what we used to be. &gt;&gt; That's right. We're on the road. How many are on the road this morning? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So God is using these gifts that we read of in in Ephesians 4:11, these ministry gifts to build his temple, which is you and me. And brother Brown said, "It's God trying to condition his people so he can get from them what he created them for." That's a powerful thought, church. &gt;&gt; He can get from them what he created them for. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He created you to be a ruler. He created you to be a king and a priest. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He created you to uh to rule and reign with him right in the millennium. &gt;&gt; We read about that last week. He created you for that. Well, how are you going to get that kind of character, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; There's only one way to get it &gt;&gt; is by going through what you're going through right now. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's good. &gt;&gt; By going through the process and not jumping out. Right. like a Navy Seal trying to be, you know, becoming a Navy Seal. I forget how many of them fail in doing that. Most people who apply never become a SEAL, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Because what happens is they they they don't realize how tough it's going to be. &gt;&gt; But the toughness is because what they want is not a soldier who will give up when he faces a firefight. &gt;&gt; What they're wanting is somebody who run towards the sound of the of gunfire. somebody who will who go headlong into a battle. That's what they're looking for. So, so they make it intentionally tough because they're wanting a certain character at the end. Don't you realize what God's doing today? He's made life. He's allowed troubles to come, trials to come. Many times we we even doubt and we we we go through struggles. We fall for a while and we get we get messed up in life and we struggle with our families. We struggle in our homes. What is God doing? He's taking us to something a character. Brother Joe that he wants us to be in. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; Something that he wants us to be. He said he never made you to be something else besides a son and daughter of God. He said if you've missed that being a son and daughter of God, you've missed the mark. We put so much well I'm going to be this. I'm going to be that. I'm going to get this degree here. I'm going to be this in my life. But listen, he never made you to be something else besides a son or daughter of God. and he'll do whatever he has to do to heal you out &gt;&gt; and make you a son or daughter of God. Brother said if you miss that, you've missed the mark. Now the word sin means missing the mark. That's what that means. And brother Random illustrates that. He said if you take a gun and it's not tuned up. Now, I I have I have guns and I've shot weapons, but not like some of y'all have, but you know, if you if you if you don't have it tuned in, I'm not good at tuning in a scope or or making sure that it's right. Calibrating it, I guess, would be the word. I'm not good at that. And so, no matter how good a shot you are, if your weapon's not tuned, not calibrated correctly, &gt;&gt; you'll miss the mark. Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. So, Brother Brandham talks about that and talks about how that if you miss just a little bit up here, you're going to miss by inches down here. And inches might make all the difference. &gt;&gt; Right. So many times what we're struggling with now is not because of now. It's because of something we failed to do years ago. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Right. And we didn't take the word of God seriously maybe. And so God just let us let it go. Let it go in our lives until finally because he's wanting to do something with us. So he lets us just follow our own will for a while and we find out we get to the target and we'd missed it by that much. How in the world did that happen because you started back here, &gt;&gt; right? And you got to go back and redo that. Retune that. But the Brandon said, "God put you here to be a Christian." He said, "If you're off to one side, come back and get tuned up." &gt;&gt; Oh, listen to me, church. The altar is not just for sinners. The altar is for Christians. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; A pastor is not just for young people. But pastor, God give us a pastor for all of us. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Sometimes we all need a pastor. Sometimes we all need a preacher. Sometimes we all need the church. Sometimes we all need one another. Sometimes we all need some help. There's no shame in asking for help. &gt;&gt; Many times because of pride, we don't do that. And that's how we end up missing the mark. &gt;&gt; I know one thing. If I was missing the mark and I needed to shoot something, &gt;&gt; I would find somebody who knows how to tune it up. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandon said, "There's only one thing can tune you up, and that's the scripture." &gt;&gt; How many believe that today? &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit in the scripture tune you, bring you directly onto the target again. I say, "God, tune me up this morning. make me right. We are see he wants us to be a living tabernacle of the living God. If we go back a book from first Peter or from second Peter rather to first Peter in our Bibles 1 Peter chapter 2, Peter talks about this how we're to be living tabernacles of the living God. 1 Peter 2:1, wherefore laying aside all malice and all guile, in other words, let's be real with one another. must be truthful and hypocrisies and envys and all evil speakings as newborn babes. Desire the sincere milk of the word that you may grow thereby. Other words, let's not try to pretend what to be what we're not. &gt;&gt; If you're still on that faith level and you're struggling, you're trying to it's not say, "Well, so and so don't struggle, so I'll try to be like them." There's no merit in that. &gt;&gt; A pretend house is still a pretend house. You ever been on a movie set? Few years ago, we went to old Tucson and walked around the movie set where a lot of the old great westerns were made. It's just a set, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It looks good, but it's a set. &gt;&gt; It's a false front. &gt;&gt; And if you're a false front Christian, you may look good in church, but you're still a false front. You're empty inside. You need to come back and find out what's missing. Yes. &gt;&gt; Oh, so many people end up in that condition. I I will say that all of us build false fronts from time to time. But he said, "Let's lay that aside." If we need to be a baby, if we need to desire sincere milk, say, "Lord, give me what I need." &gt;&gt; You say, "But I've been around a long time, but where are you at in your life?" Let's take an honest appraisal. See what it is that we need &gt;&gt; that you may grow thereby. If so be you've tasted that the Lord is gracious. So if you've even come to him and and you've recognized there's something about the message or something about the word that's helping you that's leading you, you've tasted the Lord is gracious. He said to whom coming as unto a living stone disallowed indeed of men but chosen of God and precious. Hallelujah. Ye also so he was chosen of God and precious. You also as lively stones were living stones are built up a spiritual house, a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ. You are both the temple and the priesthood. Amen. To offer up a spiritual sacrifice in your own temple to God. This is your purpose. It's your destiny. It's what you were born to be. All of us have a purpose. &gt;&gt; Listen, and I know we worry sometimes say, "Well, if I had a purpose, I wouldn't have gone through what I've gone through. If I had a purpose, I wouldn't have been born the way I was born or where I was born or the time I was born." Listen, God sometimes don't see. We He don't always show us. He don't always reveal in our birth or where we're at in our beginning of our life what we will be. &gt;&gt; Does that make sense? Look, look. Pharaoh was born for destruction. How many know that the Bible says that &gt;&gt; he said he was fitted, he was a vessel fitted for destruction. &gt;&gt; But Moses was born in Pharaoh's house. &gt;&gt; Or rather, he was he was raised in Pharaoh's house. &gt;&gt; So the house you were raised in. Come on. But he was of different a different gene, &gt;&gt; a different seed. The house you were raised in does not dictate what your future is. what God wants you to use you to be. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. And so just because listen, Moses was raised to be a Pharaoh. He was raised to harden himself against his enemies. He was raised to protect Egypt. He was raised to do that and all the arts of the Egyptians. He was raised to be a Pharaoh. But he could not be a Pharaoh because there was something on the inside of him. He was a failure as a Pharaoh. Listen to me, church. You'll be a failure if you're not in the will of God. Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; No matter how worldly how much worldly success you had, Moses had conquered the world, but he was a failure and ended up killing an Egyptian and running for his life. And all he had to show for it was one dead Egyptian in the sand. Brother said, "One stinking Egyptian until he finally on the back side of a desert after 40 years of God building that man up, he finally become what God called him to be." Hallelujah. I got confidence this morning that God's doing that to some of us. We may be on the back side of the desert right now, but the pillar of fire is here. You can meet him this morning and it'll change your life. &gt;&gt; Point you to your destiny. &gt;&gt; You can't be a Pharaoh &gt;&gt; if you're born to be Moses. Even if you live in Pharaoh's house, Jehovah, he had a body that he made both created the blood cell, the egg and created himself in the womb of Mary. He that was a body that he made. But Jehovah wants a redeemed body to live in. That's his purpose. &gt;&gt; So he died so that we could live. And we are his building, his body built by his word. The Bible said, "A body according to scripture, a body has self prepared me. God dwells in the stature of a man, reflecting himself into that being." Perfect worship, &gt;&gt; perfect worship. What you're doing today, if you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost, is perfect worship. those who worship him. Jesus said, "The time's coming when they'll have to worship him in spirit and in truth." That's perfect worship. That's what he wants. God in us being his tabernacle, God manifesting. Second Peter chapter 1 and verse five, let's look at this. Beside this, giving all diligence. So he says, "Pay attention to it. Pay attention to it." I I don't want you to pay attention this morning because the pastor's preaching, but because I'm reading the word of God and I'm trying to tell you the word of God, it's life to us. &gt;&gt; We pay attention to it. He says, "Give all diligence. Add to your faith virtue. To virtue knowledge, and to knowledge, temperance, to temperance, patience, and to patience, godliness, and to godliness brotherly kindness, and to brotherly kindness, charity or love. fruit. The if these things be in you and abound, they make you that you shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. Now, so there are people who have a portion of this that don't even pretend to be Christians, &gt;&gt; right? They may have a little bit of faith. They might have a little bit of virtue, might have a little bit of kindness, right? But brother Brandham taught us that that was like a a blackbird sticking peacock feathers in them, &gt;&gt; right? It looks good for a while, but it don't last and it's not complete. So you you there's got to be something happen that makes you eligible for these things. Brother Brandon said, "That's the way it is. Trying to manufacture Christianity, you can't do it. The first thing you've got to do is be born again. You've got to be changed." &gt;&gt; And when you're changed, you become a new creation. He said, "Now you're getting right now." See, now you don't have to worry about the feathers. It'll take care of itself when you're born again. Listen, if you got to stick feathers on every time you come to church, then feathers are going to bother you the whole time you're in church. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Cuz it's not the real you. &gt;&gt; But how much better would it be to have a nature change and be able to come to church and just exhibit what God has already put in your life? I'm not putting on when I come to the house of God. I want to live that way every day. &gt;&gt; Oh, by the grace of God, we do. We don't. Our our religion doesn't stop at the door, but it goes home with us. &gt;&gt; Goes to the job with us. goes everywhere with us, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; We're not reformers. Listen, we are not reformers. We don't do 12step programs to people who are unsaved. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; That's not our job to do that. There's people who do that. Do a good job. I don't begrudge them a bit, but we don't do that. We believe in a nature change. And then once your nature's been changed, then we begin to teach you the things of God. &gt;&gt; But let's get the nature changed first. See, because no matter how much you understand about the mysteries, and you might be attracted to that, I believe the word will catch the attention of the elect, &gt;&gt; right? It'll catch your attention, but you still need a nature change. You might be able to talk about it, but you still need a nature change. You might be able to argue about it and know what your favorite quote is and know all about the message, but you still need a nature change. Because no matter how how much you put a a skirt a tutu on a pig. That's kind of a funny image, isn't it? Put a skirt on a pig, put it out in the pig pin, it's going right back into the waller. &gt;&gt; You ever seen a dog I I think I think uh Esther's dog gets a bath every time Trip comes to our house. That may be the only reason she's keeping you around, bud. But but it seemed like that dog gets a bath every time. You know what that dog does when he gets a bath? He goes out in the backyard and he just rolls in the dirt. And the dust flies everywhere. Why? He's got the nature of a dog. He don't mind how he smells. &gt;&gt; He don't care. That's the nature of a dog. He wants to be out rolling around in the dirt. Oh God, we just realized what a sinner is. Brother Brand said, "Don't begrudge a sinner." You know, he might be a drinker, might be a smoker. That's all he has to satisfy himself. We don't hate people because they do wrong things. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; We don't look down on them because they do things that are wrong. But what they need is an experience with Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; a a change of nature. &gt;&gt; And no teaching can can give us that. But if you have that, you can believe for all things. &gt;&gt; And and sometimes, you know, we give up because we've had maybe even had a nature change and we we see some dirt still on us because we have to be washed by the word and we we get discouraged. Don't do that. Just keep letting yourself be washed. &gt;&gt; You're not who you used to be or you wouldn't be in church. Somebody's hearing me today. Yeah. You wouldn't be sitting here if you were who you used to be. &gt;&gt; Are you with me today? &gt;&gt; But there's something that keeps drawing you back to the word. Drawing you back, pulling you back to the word. What is that? There's something in you has changed. Get into that. Surrender to that. &gt;&gt; Let him become Let him Let him grow in you. Let faith and virtue and knowledge and all of these things grow up into a full grown Christian, a fully born son, a trueborn son of God. &gt;&gt; We're not reformers. The Bible says, "Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he's a new creature. Old things are passed away. Behold, all things are become new." But the brand taught us the old man doesn't understand supernatural things. He doesn't understand shouting. He doesn't understand speaking in tongues. Doesn't understand how we listen to the word. doesn't understand what we do. The old man doesn't understand that because they can't understand the kingdom until they're born again. He can't understand it. He said until that man is born again. Then when he's born again, then he's in line of fellowship because he's a new creation. He said that old suspicious doubting character he was &gt;&gt; dead. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; He said now he's a new creation. So you see, he don't have to add anything to his now because it'll automatically be added. So now listen, God's already been working in your life and giving you faith and virtue and knowledge, all these things. But you come to a place where he just adds it automatically. That's the token. That's the spirit of God. It just you just give in to it. You surrender to it and it just adds automatically. It grows in your life. Brother Brandon put it this way. He said, "It's like a tree." He said, "All you have to do is water it. It just pushes out branches and pushes out branches and gets bigger and gets bigger. You just never quit watering. One day it'll push out a branch and you'll you'll be in eternity. Then &gt;&gt; what is it? You just you started watering it one day. You got to start somewhere. &gt;&gt; So teaching is for those who have the Holy Ghost. Most teaching is for those who have the Holy Ghost. Right? What we teach people who don't have it is how to get it. &gt;&gt; All &gt;&gt; right. But people who do have it, what do we teach them? We teach them the word. We preach the word. And the word is powerful. It's a it's it's alive and powerful. It's a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. And it divides the the the bone and the marrow. The Bible says it makes a difference in our lives. See, but if you don't have the Holy Ghost, no matter how much you assimilate with Christians year by year by year, then you you don't have that you you don't have that ability to receive teaching. And so you always have that suspicious nature towards the message of the hour. John 14:26 tells us, "The comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the father will send in my name, he shall teach you how many things?" all things &gt;&gt; and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said it to you. Brother Brandham said see you must come under teaching. You say I don't need no one to teach me after the Holy Ghost has come. My friend, he said that just gives me a little room to doubt whether you really got it or not. He said the way you're acting with it see the thing you're doing. He said if the Bible said the Holy Spirit is the teacher, why did the Holy Spirit put teachers in the church? He said to set the church in order the same Holy Spirit. So he explains it. He said we don't need any seminaries to go around a big bunch of men to look out these things. The Holy Spirit is the teacher. It's the teacher and it gives some fellow a gift of teaching. He said, "And then you must be subject to that gift." But you can't even receive that without the Holy Ghost. Neither can I preach it without the Holy Ghost. Right? Are you with me now? So, I want to show that statue of a perfect man. I know we've gone through this before. Maybe some of you haven't seen it. And if you can't see that, if it's too small, I can send it to you later if you ask. But the statue of a perfect man is, and you can show that on the on the stream if you would. You can see it on there a little planer if you go back and watch. But the statue of a perfect man is these virtues that Peter mentions that come from the divine nature. And brother Brandham is inspired to put these into a pyramid form and and then he's inspired how they connect with the ages. So, you see where we're living? We're living actually at the top of that. And we're we're not living at the bottom. We're living in that Leosian age at the very end of that Leosian age during a time we call the bride age or the bride time. We're living at the very end of that. And so, we the Elijah has already come, right? &gt;&gt; We we believe that. And so, all things have been restored to us. The seals have been opened. The book has been open. And so we're living right at the top. And so that's where the age is. But the person has to grow up into the age. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? A person who's born in the age of Luther could only grow up into Luther. That was his potentials. A person who was born in the age of Wesley could only grow up into sanctification. Let me tell you, we don't believe the word's important. The word is very important. What you're hearing is very important because it's the word that grows us up. &gt;&gt; That's right. Right? And your potential today is not justification. It's not sanctification, but your potential is not even just the baptism of the Holy Ghost or the or the gifts of the spirit, but your potential is the rapture. &gt;&gt; Right? It's the coming down of the capstone to the body. &gt;&gt; That's your po God. That's your potential is to head back on the body again. And it's by the word that we are matured up into that. So actually in our age because all the word they heard in Luther was just enough to make them justified. All they heard in Wesley was enough to make them sanctified. All they heard in Pentecost was enough to make them have the gifts of the spirit and run and shout and jump. But now we've reached an age where we can become fullborn sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But you don't start as an individual at the top. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You start at the bottom. And that's where so many of us struggle with is right there at the bottom. Brother Jeremy, I thought of you this week as I was studying these things because sometimes a person that comes out of the world and some of you know brother Jeremy's testimony come out of the world and come to the message and was born again. &gt;&gt; Right? I believe that with all of my heart because brother Jeremy's life has changed. And so you see that you you realize he's not what he used to be. &gt;&gt; I didn't know him back then, but I've heard the stories. Some of the stories get magnified, you know, over time. But but you know he's not what he used to be. And many of you have that experience, right? You've been out there and but it's easier for you many times to take that first step to have that faith because there's such a clear line. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Between what you was, right? &gt;&gt; So you can believe because you know what you were &gt;&gt; and you know what you are. Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; God's brought you from that. But some of our young ones raised in church and some of these young ladies and young men, they have a difficult time because I I did I was raised in church. And so that step of faith, I never left the world. I never went out in the world. Right? I still had to deal with a carnal nature. &gt;&gt; I was still sinful. I told Brother Bill Stewart this morning, if I was a sinner, I wouldn't be a good sinner. &gt;&gt; I can tell you that right now. I'd be a really bad sinner. &gt;&gt; I know what I would be without the grace of God. &gt;&gt; God has revealed that to me. I don't know that by experience. &gt;&gt; I know that by God has shown me what you know. And sometimes you can tell just by the temptations that you have and the things that you have to fight and that you had to go through maybe even as a young person. But our young people many times they have a difficult time taking that step. That's why we want them. We we want them to go to camp. We want them to get in an atmosphere. We want them why would we preach against that? We want them to have an atmosphere of the Holy Ghost. We We want them to be born again. We want them to get right. We want to keep the altar open and give them a place to take that step of faith. &gt;&gt; Right? You got to start somewhere. &gt;&gt; And you and no matter what kind of false front you put up and what kind of appearance you've made to the church and assimilated as a Christian with the Christians, you still got to take that step of faith when you when you turn around and say, "Lord, I believe that you died for my sins. I believe that I can become one with your word. I believe the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So it starts with a foundation of faith. So that's we're going to deal with that for a moment this morning and we're going to let you go. But the foundation is faith. Brother said you must have faith for a foundation. All Christianity, all you are, all you'll ever be is based upon faith in the word. It's not based on emotion. It's not based on a preacher. It's not based on anything else. Faith in the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The Bible says without faith, it is impossible to please him. For he that cometh to God must believe. Someone say must. &gt;&gt; Must believe that he is. that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him. This is the foundation of your entire Christian walk, faith in the word. And that's why Satan will attack that over and over and over again, even as mature Christians. Many times he will attack faith in the word. He'll try to tell you the the Bible doesn't mean what it says. How many times has he done it? &gt;&gt; Or or maybe it was for somebody else but not for you. &gt;&gt; What's he doing? Trying to attack faith in the word. But I tell you this morning, if you can believe, all things are possible to them that believe. &gt;&gt; This is the foundation of your entire Christian walk. Everything, your family, your your your job, your all that we are as Christians. Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; This is the foundation, the beginnings of it is faith in the word. So, Brother Brandham, you know, he tells us a story. Now, there's a story that Brother Brandham tells. I appreciate you listening this morning. I just it's on my heart and I tonight we're going to have a baptism service after this and dinner. If you can stay for tonight, I got something on my heart for you tonight. Something completely different. But if you can stay, if you can't stay, watch that service. But you know, Brother Brand tells a story over and over again in the message. Uh you've heard it about a caribou and a grizzly bear, right? a caribou with horns 42 inches long and a grizzly bear that never had a mama, right? You know the story. I took these pictures myself in Tucson last time we were there. That's the grizzly bear that brother Brandham talked about. And on the right in that other picture is the caribou. That's an impressive set of of animals up there. On the right is that caribou that brother Brandham had or saw that was 42 in long. The the tape was 42 in at the time and it was killed. There's actually a picture of that and brother Bisll actually I believe it was brother Bisl one of the young men that were there that held the tape that was there on that trip. Now brother Brandham talks about this and he he gives us he talks about it a lot and you know we tell hunting stories. Y'all tell hunting stories. I have one hunting story and it shouldn't be told and I'll tell you privately if you want to ask me later, but one hunting story my whole life and it was a mistake. But but some of y'all have hunting stories. You tell the hunting stories and and we tell them because we want people to know &gt;&gt; we're pretty good. &gt;&gt; Let's just be honest about it. You know, I do that with fish. The fish that I've caught grow every year, just a little bit. You know how you do? You hold the fish, you take the bass, and you hold it by the lip out like this and put the camera right in front of it and it looks like it's 25 inches long. You know, it's about that big. We tell hunting stories. We tell fishing stories. Brother Brandham wasn't just telling a story. &gt;&gt; He's telling us something. They say that when in the 60s if you come to brother Brandham's house, he'd show you these and tell you about them almost every time. It was important to him. Brother Brandham explains in the statue of a perfect man why these stories were so important. He explains to us that when people come to see it, it built faith in those people to believe that God kept his word. &gt;&gt; Right. Listen, brother Brandon said last evening some friends come in. They had heard that vision told about the caribou 42inch horn and the silver tip grizzly bear. He said I don't know how many people has come at the house wants to see that. I said here's the tape measure. Get on the horn. He heard it told before it happened. See why? When God says anything, it's got to happen. &gt;&gt; Listen to me, church. He wasn't just telling a hunting story. He wasn't just trying to make it bigger and make it bigger. No, he didn't do that. He was trying to tell us something. God was telling us something in a way we could understand &gt;&gt; because some of y'all understand hunting bear. You understand hunting caribou and you understand how how elusive they are and you understand how difficult it is. And so brother Brand was trying to tell us something. That grizzly bear appeared right where it was supposed to be. And that caribou it happened just exactly the way God told him it would happen. And he said I don't know how many people's come to see that. Here's the tape measure. He says why when God says anything it's got to happen. That's the reason he said it's based. So, it gives you something that you can base faith in that God kept his word, &gt;&gt; right? Faith is not in the grizzly bear. The grizzly bear is dead. It's as dead as any other grizzly bear. The caribou is dead. But God is giving you faith to believe in something not for brother Brandham's life, but for your own life. Listen, we're not talking about what brother Brandham did. We're talking about it's a foundation, something that we can build on and say, "If God did that for a prophet, if a son of God stood there and God told him something, he can do it for me." Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, Brother Brandon says, he said, "Here's the plan. Here is the plan of salvation." How many believe that today? &gt;&gt; You want to know how to be saved? Acts 2:38. Here it is. &gt;&gt; And then if his vision happened perfectly exactly the way they say they do, hallelujah. You realize what God had to do. If you get a chance, go back and listen to Brother Wayne Lawson at Grace Tabernacle on Friday night. Brother Wayne preached a message about about the great high priest and he talked about how in Hebrews it talks about the discernment the word of God is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart and then he goes on to say Paul goes on to say seeing then oh hallelujah what was it a foundation of faith the discernment was for faith to build our faith not in brother Brandham but in the great high priest &gt;&gt; hallelujah he did a masterful job of preaching that sermon but Look, brother Brandon said, "Here's the plan of salvation." He said, "And this church knows that's right. What about his word? If he keeps the vision, what about the word?" He said, "That's more sure than the vision." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said, "If the vision didn't speak with the word, then the vision is wrong." But it's the word first because the word is God. What if we could put that kind of confidence in the word? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. But Peter says, "We have also a more sure word of prophecy, where unto you do well that you take heed as unto a light that shineth in a dark place until the day dawn and the day star arise in your hearts, knowing this first that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation. For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man. But holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost." Oh, do you believe it, church? Do you believe the Bible is for you? that the scripture speaks about you. Do you believe you can become what it says you can be? Then you can become a fullborn manifested son or daughter of God in the age that we're living in. What does that look like? It looks like you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You got to believe that. You got to start with faith. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon said, "First, you must be born again." And when you're born again, you have faith. You believe the word until you're born again, you'll argue against it. If you're just religiously inclined and you got a little human knowledge that you should do, right? You'll never be able to agree upon the word of God. You'll never do it. &gt;&gt; You got to be born again. &gt;&gt; And born again, it produces faith. I love that. The new birth produces faith because it's the gene of God being manifested in your life. And in him is faith. He had to believe, brother Jaden, his own word to create the world. Oh God, if he was able to do that and that gene seed of God is in you and you tasted the good things of God, why wouldn't you believe for the good things of life? Why wouldn't you believe beyond this life for heaven? Why wouldn't you believe that he's going to keep you and help you and make you a different person? Listen church, if you begun, he was begun a good work. &gt;&gt; He will finish it. You got to start with that foundation of faith. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon said, "Born again produces faith. After you get faith, this right here, faith, faith, then you're just in position of growing. A lot of people go up to the altar and pray and say, "Lord, forgive me." And a great experience of sanctification come upon them and things. He said, "Then you have a great time. Get up the altar shouting." You go back and say, "Bless God, I got it." No, you just started to a place where you can grow. &gt;&gt; You ain't done nothing yet. Only thing you done is just laid the foundation. He said, "Now you're going to build a house." You pour the foundation. Say, "Boy, I got her. You got the foundation to build your house on. Now you got to build a house." &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; that's what you're doing right now. Right? You believed, but now you got to build a house. &gt;&gt; What is the foundation of Christianity? Faith in the word of God. That's your foundation. Then you begin to grow. Then you start. You begin to add to this foundation. See? And so he actually wants you to be him. He became us so that we might become him. So to be him, to be a fully manifested son or daughter of God that looks like him, he had to remove the veil of the law because it hid him &gt;&gt; in tights and shadows. &gt;&gt; And he had to be revealed. The mercy seat had to be hung in plain view. That's right. &gt;&gt; Paul says it this way. 2 Corinthians 3:18, "We all with open face, beholding as in a glass or a mirror the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the spirit of the Lord." And you've got to be born again for this process to start. You find in the ancient times, Brother Brandham said they would beat gold. Are you still with me this morning? &gt;&gt; They would beat gold. And when they would beat gold, brother Brandham talked about how that they would and I went and read up on it. They would actually they actually take gold and they melt it and then they and then they get it real. There's still one family that does it in the whole world that that we know of that still does it the old way in Venice, Italy. And they'll take the gold and they'll they'll they'll melt it and and until it's liquid and then they'll they'll let it start to harden and then they'll they'll beat it really thin and then they get it thinner and thinner and thinner until it becomes gold plate until it's so thin that if you picked it up you'd it'd just crumble. &gt;&gt; But it's got to be that thin and that beaten out to be put to use. And so if you look at the they've restored the the famous statue in Venice, the the golden statue of Venice. They've restored that statue up on top of high building with that beaten gold. It's been beaten out in those sheets and it's so thin. Oh god, it it's looked like it would break, &gt;&gt; but it's exactly what they want it to be. Oh my. What are they doing? They're getting all the copper out of it and all the impurities out of it until it's absolutely pure gold. And and they make the statement. I watched a YouTube video on it. They make that the statement. They said when when the beaters get to beaten the gold and said the reason they still do it by hand, that one family is because no machine, oh God, no machine can do it like the hands. He said it just isn't the same product as it is in the hands of a master. Oh church, he didn't he didn't call mechanical devices to preach the gospel. There's nothing that can do it but the Holy Spirit moving and working and doing what he does and beating the gold. &gt;&gt; We've got to be in the hands of God so he can move us changes into what he wants us to be. Brother said that's the way God does. He takes the gold that he is found in the earth and he beats it by the Holy Spirit. Turn it over and over and over beating it until he receives. He can see his reflection. Why? Because he wants us to do his work. He wants to us to cover. Oh God, he wants us to cover. So he beats us all the impurities out of us until we can cover his people, till we can cover our families, till we can be put to his use. John 14:12 said, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that believeth on me, there's your foundation of faith. The works that I do shall he do also, and greater works than these shall he do, because I go unto my father. He didn't he didn't put you here to do nothing. Put you here to work. &gt;&gt; Look, God put Adam in in in Eden to work. Do you know that? Look at Genesis 1 26. God said, "Let us make man in our image after our likeness. Let them have dominion over all of these things, the fish of the sea and the fowl of the air, every creeping thing that creepeth on the earth." Genesis 2:15. And the Lord God took the man and put him into the Garden of Eden to have fun. Well, I'm sure it was fun because it was perfect, but he didn't put him there just to have fun. &gt;&gt; The purpose of life is not entertainment. &gt;&gt; I know it's the world that we live in today, but that's not the purpose of life. That's right. &gt;&gt; Why sometimes God allows the razor backs to lose just so you can go through some trials. He put you here to work. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? He put him in the Garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it. Oh, God. To dress it and to keep it. Even before the fall, he was put there to work. But his work was fruitful. And brother Brandon taught us how he did it is he spoke &gt;&gt; and it appeared. Oh God, we are supposed to do the works of God. He put Adam in Eden to dress it and to keep it. He put us in Satan's Eden to do his works. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He didn't put us here by accident. He didn't put us here just to survive. He put us here to do his works. &gt;&gt; He came in flesh and proved it could be done. So he gave himself as payment of the debt so true sons, born sons, manifested sons could walk the earth again. Hallelujah. Adam and Eve couldn't keep the word. Remember, they were in a perfect place and couldn't keep the word. But God said, "By the process of redemption," he said, "I'm going to come down and live in them." He said, "And I'm going to make them all such a part of me that this bride will keep the word. They will not fall. Don't you worry. They will not fall in the end. They may stumble many times, but they will not fall away." &gt;&gt; They will not fall. Why? Because of grace. &gt;&gt; That's the difference. Because the purpose of God in the end time is not to prove again that he's a redeemer, but to prove grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So many of us, brother Brown said, try to do the works of Christ before the reflection of Christ is in us. Now there's the trouble. &gt;&gt; We find those things happening. He said, "You know it, and I know it. Everybody wants this or that or the other. Everybody wants to be in front of people. But do we? If we're going to do the works of Christ, as I said at the beginning, everybody wants to be like brother Brandham, wear a buckle, belt buckle and a hat and you know how it used to be. Everybody wants to do that. Maybe today it's turn change other things. We want to be like so and so at some preacher somewhere. Everybody wants to be that, but you don't know what it took &gt;&gt; for God to get that man where he what he and make him what he became. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon said, "We find those things happening. You know it. I know it. We see these stumbles along the road. We find the scrap peep of ministers of Christians piled along the road because they didn't go into it right. They went to do the works of Christ, but they did not have the reflection of Christ. I pray, oh God, let me first have the reflection of Christ in my life. &gt;&gt; I don't want a big ministry. I don't want fortune and fame. We don't want a great big church. What we want first is the reflection of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's make sure we get that right. So, there's the trouble. We find those things happening. You know what? I know it. Stumbles along the road because they didn't go into it right. Trying to do the work before we've been beaten into his image. And you say, "Well, I had an experience." That's good. I I can preach. That's good. I can sing. That's good. We want to use you. But don't get in the head of God. Wait till the beater gets you in shape to do the work. Now, Brother Brandham taught us like this. He said, he said, "Don't wait to be educated. If you have a testimony, go tell your testimony." That's right. &gt;&gt; Don't try to preach the seals. Tell your testimony. You don't know how valuable that might be to somebody. I was lost, but now I'm found. My baby was healed. My I was healed. My my I know God like the little girl that was captured. You remember the story? And she went down there into Syria and she surrounded by enemies and and non her her her her master that her person who had her enslaved the naming the Syrian was sick. He got leprosy. And the little girl stood up and gave a testimony. And she said, "If you were in my country, you could be delivered of leprosy." Even though at that time, no one had ever been delivered of leprosy. But she knew that Elijah served a real God. Oh, hallelujah. Elisha served a real God. She knew that God was real. And so she testified. How many could testify today? He's still real. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; You can do something. He said, "Brother Brand said, if you got the candle lit, go tell how it got lit." &gt;&gt; But wait on your ministry. &gt;&gt; See, when we're born again, that's when the battle begins. Brother Brandon said, "Here's what we do." What's the first thing? Have faith and be born again. That's laying the foundation. When we're born again, the battle begins. We need the shield of faith to win the battle. &gt;&gt; See, a manifested son of God, what does that look like? with someone who's shielded by faith in the word where the fiery darts don't have the effect on him that he would an unshielded or they would an unshielded person, right? That that that person that where you look at say, "Boy, they're so mature and so godly, such a saint." Well, they've just held up that shield of faith. It's not them that's doing it. It's Christ in them. &gt;&gt; The shield of faith. Listen, you young people, you can hold up your shield of faith. &gt;&gt; Ephesians 6:16, above all, taking the shield of faith wherewith you should be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked. That word above all, we take that wrong because of modern English, it's not saying uh above all that it's the most important. What it's saying is covering all. Covering all, protecting all. Look at the amplified version. Lift up over all the covering shield of saving faith upon which you can quench all. Someone say all. &gt;&gt; The flaming missiles of the wicked one. See, if you can't defend yourself, you have no chance on the battlefield. You've got to be able to defend yourself. And Jesus found that when he was tempted, he was tempted by the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life. And yet none of it, the fiery darts were the same fiery darts that that the devil uses for us and it sticks sometimes and it burns us. Why didn't it burn him? Because he had the shield of faith, &gt;&gt; right? In the word. &gt;&gt; What did he do when when Satan said he said he said this is what you know if you're the son of God, you know, make these stones bread. And Jesus said it's also written. &gt;&gt; Right? He had faith in who he was and he had faith in the word. Look, he was tempted the same way we were. Look at those pictures of the of the shield. That's the Roman shield that Paul was probably talking about. It's actually a a full body shield. And you can see in on on the on your left side, there's a formation. And the formation they could move through all the arrows that were coming at them. had they even had shields over their legs, armor on their legs, and they could walk through into a a storm of enemy fire. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Because they had the shield, &gt;&gt; the shield was curved so that it would bounce off either direction. It was built specifically to quench fiery darts, right? Because the enemy is going to send them. And this shield was built specifically to quench those darts. Listen. And so there was protection that they would actually get in a formation called the turtle formation where they would completely close themselves in and they could be protected and before they could reload they could rush the enemy. So there was a great uh advantage to being shielded and it was the Roman weapons more than anything else. Their their genius and weapons was able to make them conquer the world. And so they had these shields and Paul picks that up. He said it's the shield of faith. We're not covered by our feelings. We're covered by faith. &gt;&gt; The thing that protects you is what you believe. &gt;&gt; Oh, I hope you're hearing me this morning. That's the foundation of all that you ever will be as a Christian. What protects you is what you believe. Do you believe the message? Do you believe what God has done in our day? Do you believe in your brother and sister? Come on, church. Do you believe you're going to go in a rapture? Can't you believe? That's the foundation of what does a mature son of God look like? What does a manifested son look like? He looks like this. He's covered by the shield of faith. &gt;&gt; The Roman centurion. Interesting that he was a military man who would have carried one of these shields, commanded an army, but he come to Jesus. Remember the story? Come to Jesus and they said, "Oh, his daughter's dying or his servant rather, I believe it was, was dying." And the Jesus started to go to his house. Matthew 8:8 says, "The centurion answered and said,"Lord, I'm not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof, but speak the word only and my servant shall be healed." What was it? He grasps the concept of faith. That's gentile faith. The kind of faith that comes by the Holy Ghost dwelling in you. Listen, that's the house of God. The house that God dwells in. Brother said, "Not a building with a big bell on top of it. But a body hast prepared me. A body God can talk in, God can work in. A living instrumentality of God. Your written epistles." The Bible says, "Rad of all men. And if the life that's in Christ be in you, you'll bear the life that Christ bore." Hurrying on. Now, he said, "Will you take us?" I had to include this quote. You forgive me. He said, "You take us, there's nothing but a wild gourd, a knad. Well, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's what he that's what brother Brandon says about we're it's a wild gore to not head. See, and there's nothing to us for all dead in sin and trespasses. We're all in these kind of conditions. &gt;&gt; And then we ourselves can prostrate ourselves, give ourselves up until God takes his transfusion to the name of Jesus Christ because there's not another name under heaven whereby man can be saved and transfers the life of Christ into us. He said, "Then we have this kind of faith." The faith that Christ had and Christ's faith was not based in those Pharisees or Sadducees in their pots, kettles, and pants. Listen, our faith is not in long hair and long dresses. That's not where we place our faith. We place our faith in the word. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It was based on the word of God. Amen. So much until Christ was the word. The word was made flesh. And then when we can get so transfused by his power, we die our own thinking. Our faith becomes a genuine faith. Hallelujah. Then the life of Christ is transfused into us. Musicians go ahead and come. He said we become living creatures of God, a dwelling place where the Holy Spirit can send his radiant blessings down through there and we're in the stature of Christ. I got more to say this morning, but I think you get the point. And Steuart, somebody's got to break the cycle here of long-winded preaching, but What does a manifested son look like? His grown-up faith. She might tell me this morning say, "Bro, brother Ben, I just have a little child's faith." That's a good faith. It's simple. That's a good faith to have. Brother Brand or Jesus said, "Be like little children." Paul tells us to be like children. Simplicity. He said, "But be men in the word when it comes to the word." Say, "I got a little bit of faith, brother Ben." Well, just feed that the word. Feed it the word. I know you've heard that over and over again, but are we doing it, church? Are we doing it? [Music] That's your foundation. And you let faith grow in you by feeding at the word. What word? Philippians 1:6. Being confident of this very thing, that he which has begun a good work in you, brother West. He begun something good in you. But you you just let that build. Feed that the word, right? Feed it the word. Negativity won't help you. The world won't help you. Entertainment won't help you. But the word will change you. &gt;&gt; Feed your faith. The word. Feed it the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. We still believe that God sent a message for a reason. Feed your faith the message. Feed your faith the Bible. feed your faith the good things of God by reminding yourself of things that God has said. See, because you didn't lay the foundation of faith. If you have even a little bit of faith today, he gave that to you. He provided you with that. And he his hands have laid the foundation, as we've said many times recently, and he will finish it. That's where our hope lays. You might not have much hope right now. And with every head bowed and every eye closed, those of you are watching, maybe you could bow with us. Bow your heads. You may not have much faith. You may not feel like there's any way out of your current situation. You You've said some or done something. That's not right. that he laid the foundation. Why don't you just believe him today? You see, the way out is not to be down on yourself or feel sorry for yourself. The way out of that pit is to believe. To believe. And when somebody throws dirt on you, you just walk on it till you walk right out of that pit. Hallelujah. Maybe you You just want to slip up a hand acknowledge to the Lord. Say, "Lord, I I may not be where I want to be, but I'm not what I used to be. Increase our faith, Lord. Increase my faith. Help me, Lord. My hands are raised. I I Lord, help me. I want to be a fullborn, mature son of God in an age when it calls us to that. We can live in that. I want to be able to speak and God back it up. Oh God, help me. God help me today. But got to begin somewhere. Let me begin by believing the word that I've been given. Heavenly Father or Jesus, I pray for our congregation today, Lord, for we're we're a church. It's not my church. It's ours. And every member, whether they're present this morning or not, they're part of that. I pray God that you would just most of all it's your church. I pray Lord that you would just come in every heart. I pray you would soften the the stony hearts. Lord, you're the only one that can do that. I I've tried so many times to change a mind and I couldn't change the mind because I couldn't change the heart. But Lord, you can change our hearts. Take away the old stony heart and put in a heart of flesh. That's not the even the new birth. That's just the beginning. I pray you'd grant it to us today, Lord. Oh, and if we had begun, oh God, if there's one here who's never begun, I pray they would begin today on that foundation of faith. If they've never begun, I pray, God, that you would just do that work in them. They have begun. I pray you would increase by the word every day, every hour until we leave here in the fullness of our adoption, in the change of our bodies. Pray you'd grant it today. We love you and we thank you in Jesus name. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. If you seen that, Peter. Hallelujah. If you need prayer, the altar's open today. We've got a baptism service in just a moment. Listen, if you haven't been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ, the water's ready. We have a a young man wants to be baptized. Be glad to baptize you today. Hallelujah. Oh, this is my desire. Oh, could you sing it to him this morning? To honor you. Oh, can we stand together and sing it? Oh Lord, with all my heart, hallelujah, I worship you. If anyone else needs prayer, the altar's open now. Come if you need if you need prayer, we'll be glad to pray with you. Hallelujah. All I have within me. Oh yes. Oh, I give you praise. Hallelujah. Sing it now. All that I All I know is in you, Lord. I give you my heart. I give you my soul. I live for you, oh Lord. Every breath that I take, every moment I have your way. This is my desire. We honor you, Lord, with all my heart. I worship you. All I have within me are all that I know is Lord, I gave you my heart. I give you my soul. I live for you. my every breath that I take all the way in me. Lord, I give you my heart. I give you my soul. I live for you. I know every breath that I take my way. Lord, have your me. Lord, I give you my heart. in my soul for you know everywhere. Let me walk with you Jesus. Holy without love. You are forever. Oh my god. Without you, I hallelujah. Would never Oh, don't you love him this morning? No. Never make it my home. Do we know those verses? Oh, let's sing one of them now. Oh, you found me when I was so lonely. You remember what that felt like, church, to be worthy of praise today. You found me when I was so blue. Oh, hallelujah. Oh, you found me when no one could love me. Hallelujah. Oh, when no one knew just what to do. Sing it now with all your heart. Oh, soul. Let me walk with you, Jesus. So great, Lord. Oh, don't ever leave me or leave me alone. For without you, oh for without you I I could never. Oh never make heaven in my home. We got a young man should be baptized today. Went to Acts 238. Christian baptism is in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And we've seen a little revival among our young people, even the little ones that are old enough. And I'm thankful for that. We need a revival among the parents. Today, it's me standing in the need of prayer. I know all of us do. There's some serious needs. I know healthwise. in the church and we're just going to have prayer for little Luke and brother Stewart's going to baptize him. We'll just exit the building immediately after we're done here praying and we just go on out and the baptismal service. But we got some real needs people. Brother Bill Curtis real need in his body. Sister Cletus and just just doctors can't do a whole lot at that age. And so there's only God can heal them. Oh, we believe that he's not a respector of age. Brother JT has been in need for a long time. And some of you other elders, you suffer and things. Our young people, you keep praying for them. Pray for me and Brother Joel and Brother Stewart. We need to pray for one another. Our our couples, our married couples. The devil's doing everything he can to destroy our marriages in this day and destroy couples, destroy homes. But we serve a God that's able to help. But do you believe it today? Bible says, "Ask and you shall receive." So let's pray for all of these things together. Just lift up your voice to him in your own way. And I just believe God's going to take care of it. Heavenly Father, I pray first for brother Luke. Lord's going to be baptized. I pray you would come down, Lord. Lord, and just just fill that young man with the Holy Ghost, Lord, at a young age. Oh God, I believe you could do it. Lord, he come to me personally and wanted to be baptized. I thank you for that desire, Lord. And I pray that you continue to work in his life, Lord. May he never leave or fall away. May he come directly, Lord, and just serve you with all of his heart without all the scars. Pray you grant that for all of our young people, Lord. Oh God, I pray for our our our couples, some of them new, Lord, and different ones that are, Lord, that are just just Lord, maybe they're on that foundation of faith, but they're building. I pray you'd help them to build, Lord. And some that have been around a long time, but they're struggling. God, I I pray you'd reach down. You know how to change hearts. You know, Lord, how to soften hearts. Lord, there's there's saints here who have loved ones out of the ark of safety. I pray God you'd reach down where they're at this morning, Lord. Arrest that child, oh God. I pray you'd do it today, Lord. I I pray you'd touch our elders, Lord. Heal their bodies. I pray. Oh, I pray you'd grant it today. Each one of them, Lord. I pray you'd heal them, Lord. Bring them back to the house of God. I pray. Granted, Father, we love you today. And we thank you for all that you've done, Lord. If there's those that I didn't mention, Lord, it's not by neglect. Lord, I just pray that you'd reach down to each one of them, Father, and heal them and save them and bring them where they need to be. We pray in Jesus name. Amen. Thank you, Lord Jesus. I would never. Oh, no. Never make heaven my home. If we begin to go outward just right out the back door, out the handicap door if you would go straight across before we dismiss. Let me walk with you, Jesus. Oh, thank you, Lord. Oh, don't ever leave me. Leave me alone. Oh, thank you, Lord. Oh, without you I I would never. Oh, no. Never make heaven my alone. Oh, so let
