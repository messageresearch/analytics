[44:26] again this morning to fill this sweet
[44:28] Spirit Lord and to know Lord that you're
[44:31] here with us
[44:32] what more could we ask than that an
[44:34] omnipotent almighty God
[44:37] come down and
[44:39] and be with us Lord that's that's what
[44:43] you did when you became flesh
[44:46] Lord but when you died on Calvary and
[44:49] you Rose again on the third day you
[44:50] didn't go back just to a throne in glory
[44:52] to stay there but you came down again
[44:55] and filled your church Lord with your
[44:58] Holy Spirit
[44:59] Arden we have little licks of fire today
[45:02] that we've brought together Lord and may
[45:05] your presence be felt and be known we're
[45:07] so thankful for it Lord I pray that I
[45:10] would not say anything this morning that
[45:12] would be out of your will
[45:14] keep me under the cross Lord keep me
[45:16] under Lord a sacrificial
[45:20] Lord Ministry that a Ministry of
[45:23] reconciliation Lord I I don't want to
[45:25] step outside of that I I want you to be
[45:27] my guide today and the guide of these
[45:30] people as we look into the scriptures
[45:31] and into the message of the hour I pray
[45:34] you just help us Lord you saw the hands
[45:36] that were raised and you see those that
[45:38] are sick many this morning that are sick
[45:40] and out of church a breed reached down
[45:43] with her out of their streaming today I
[45:45] I pray that a special blessing would
[45:46] come to them as they watch and listen
[45:48] and participate in the service Lord
[45:51] we'll give you all the praise and the
[45:53] glory and the honor for it's in Jesus
[45:55] name we pray
[45:57] amen amen is this one
[46:00] working amen turn with me to Joshua
[46:03] chapter 21 and verse 43.
[46:07] Joshua 21 and 43 and then Revelation 10
[46:10] 7 technology is great if it works
[46:14] I think that's my fault I forgot to
[46:16] check the batteries
[46:18] Joshua 21 43 in Revelation 10 7 brother
[46:21] Joel's in Wisconsin today and brother
[46:24] brother Willie he was looking forward to
[46:27] some time when you would come and get to
[46:29] fellowship with you and then he's gone
[46:30] so I'm going to rub that in that's what
[46:32] he gets for being gone so it's good to
[46:34] have brother Willie Valance and his
[46:36] family with us this morning and maybe
[46:38] someday you can come back and meet the
[46:39] other two-thirds of the church and
[46:41] and a number of folks gone today and
[46:44] brother uh so we'll just have one
[46:46] service today no afternoon service
[46:48] brother Timothy Pruitt will be with us
[46:51] for both Services next weekend so we're
[46:53] looking forward to that and just expect
[46:55] a special blessing from the Lord amen
[46:58] amen but I believe there is a special
[47:00] blessing for this morning how many
[47:01] believe that you come expecting amen
[47:04] let's go to Joshua 21 43 and the lord
[47:07] gave unto Israel all the land which he
[47:10] swear to give unto their fathers and
[47:13] they possessed it and dwelt therein and
[47:15] the lord gave them rest round about
[47:18] according to all that he swear into
[47:20] their fathers and there stood not a man
[47:23] of all their enemies before them the
[47:26] Lord delivered all their enemies into
[47:27] their hand what did he do he kept his
[47:30] word
[47:31] and then Revelation 10 7. but in the
[47:34] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[47:36] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[47:39] of God should be finished this is not
[47:42] the beginning of a mystery it's the
[47:44] finishing up of the mystery the mystery
[47:48] of God should be finished as he has
[47:49] declared to his servants the prophets
[47:51] what did he do he kept his word aren't
[47:54] you grateful for that today amen we want
[47:56] to talk about that again you may be
[47:58] seated
[48:03] there ever was an hour that we should
[48:05] not be ignorant of the word it's today
[48:08] it's an hour when when light is coming I
[48:11] got to thinking about me and my wife you
[48:14] know when we wake up we wake up
[48:15] differently I I wake up and I'm wide
[48:17] awake and my wife wakes up slowly and
[48:20] over time and so she'll wake up and
[48:23] she'll go in and turn one light on and
[48:24] and then she'll turn another light on
[48:26] and slowly turn the lights on when I get
[48:28] up I go through all all through the
[48:30] house and turn on all of the lights
[48:31] because because I want to have light I
[48:34] want to be able to see what I'm doing
[48:35] it's morning time and morning is a time
[48:38] for light and brother Branham told us
[48:40] that to the bride he said Shalom he said
[48:43] it's morning good morning it's morning
[48:45] time and I believe that this is not an
[48:47] hour of Darkness this is not an hour
[48:49] when we should walk around not knowing
[48:51] what we're talking about and not
[48:53] understanding the things of God and I
[48:55] know they're it's not an intellectual
[48:57] conception or or an ability just to
[49:00] understand with your mind but there's
[49:01] got to come a revelation in this hour
[49:04] that we know who we are and where we
[49:06] belong and and what our position in the
[49:09] word is and and that's what the the
[49:11] people of Israel were beginning to know
[49:13] as God kept his word to bring them out
[49:16] of Egypt and bring them into the land of
[49:18] Israel they begin to know the word
[49:20] became a lamp to their feet and the
[49:22] promises gave them light to be able to
[49:24] go in and take the land and that's where
[49:26] we're at today
[49:28] and so in Psalms 119 105 the Bible says
[49:31] Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a
[49:34] light unto my path how many could say
[49:36] Amen to that today I was walking in
[49:39] darkness but your word is a lamp to my
[49:41] feet I was I was in a room that was dark
[49:43] but a man came in and turned on the
[49:46] light the Christ came into the room amen
[49:49] and there's light here now this message
[49:52] is not a message of Darkness but it's a
[49:54] message of light
[49:56] so there's light now in the room and
[49:58] again in verse 130 of Psalms 119 it says
[50:02] the entrance of thy words
[50:04] the entrance of thy words now watch when
[50:07] your words enter the room when your
[50:09] words enter my life when your words
[50:12] enter my my brain my mind enter sink
[50:15] down into my heart when your words into
[50:17] the room there is light
[50:21] of thy words giveth light he giveth
[50:23] understanding unto the simple well I'm
[50:27] so glad brother Paul that he included me
[50:29] in that gives understanding to the
[50:31] simple happy birthday brother Paul I
[50:33] thought it was your birthday today God
[50:35] bless you aren't you glad to have light
[50:37] today
[50:39] Hey Man II Peter 1 19 says we have also
[50:42] a more sure word of Prophecy and I'm
[50:44] just building a background now to what
[50:46] we want to say this morning he said we
[50:48] have a more sure word of Prophecy where
[50:50] until you do well that you take heed as
[50:52] unto a light that shineth in a dark
[50:55] place
[50:56] denominationalism was a dark place I
[50:58] don't want to go back to that
[51:00] Catholicism is a dark place I don't want
[51:02] to go back to that we've been set free
[51:04] from that and so the light shines in a
[51:07] dark place until the day Dawn and the
[51:09] day star arrives in your hearts
[51:12] the message is the light of the hour how
[51:14] many believe that today
[51:16] now but we are the Lesser lights and
[51:19] brother Branham taught us that Lester
[51:21] lion the moon or a star was a reflection
[51:24] of that great light and everything that
[51:28] of the moon has or everything that a
[51:30] star has it has no light in itself as
[51:32] much as it is a reflection of a greater
[51:35] light and it's reflecting a light
[51:36] somewhere it's brother Brandon talks
[51:38] about a star in other places he speaks
[51:40] about the moon but he he said if you
[51:42] could talk to the star and say star why
[51:44] do you shine he said well if he could
[51:45] talk he would say brother Branham I'm
[51:47] not shining but what's making you shine
[51:49] it's something shining on me it's the
[51:52] sun shining on me he said brother
[51:53] Branham I just happen to light up the
[51:55] path for you Oh my he said well then the
[51:58] true Pastor in the pulpit if he's
[52:01] anointed of God it's not the pastor
[52:03] Shining it's not him a good preacher but
[52:07] Stuart with Allen he said it's not him
[52:08] he said it's a good past good pastor
[52:11] it's not him it's the Holy Spirit
[52:13] shining on him giving the Gospel Light
[52:16] oh so I want to I'm so struck by that
[52:19] but while I was studying for the sermon
[52:21] but the George Moore sent me that quote
[52:23] and it just struck me because that's the
[52:25] hour that we live in we live in an hour
[52:27] of light
[52:28] light has entered the room
[52:30] it's not a time to be down and
[52:33] despondent and depressed and discouraged
[52:35] but it's a time to be excited because
[52:37] light is here he said arise and shine
[52:40] thy light has come
[52:42] amen do we believe that this morning
[52:45] amen so it's a positive word as we
[52:47] preached last week
[52:49] but I want to now kind of go into a more
[52:51] in depth and uh
[52:53] I struggle with I don't want to get so
[52:55] in depth that the children couldn't even
[52:58] understand I believe our children ought
[52:59] to be able to understand the opening of
[53:02] the word when I say that I mean the
[53:03] opening of uh the message the light that
[53:06] come in our day
[53:07] I believe they ought to be able to
[53:09] understand that I believe every one of
[53:10] us
[53:11] ought to be able to understand that it
[53:13] shouldn't be exclusive to preachers
[53:15] there's a lot there's a land here
[53:18] you might as well go in and take some
[53:20] and brother Brandon said where Pentecost
[53:22] failed he said they went and got grapes
[53:24] and said with speaking in tongues he
[53:26] said they went and got grapes and ate on
[53:28] the grapes and said oh this is all there
[53:29] is he said but there's houses there's
[53:31] land
[53:32] he said there's families there's all
[53:34] kinds of things on the other side of
[53:35] Jordan if you could just go in and take
[53:38] a look around I believe that in the land
[53:40] in the message of the hour is that's
[53:43] where our home life comes from that's
[53:45] where our our church life comes from
[53:48] that's where everything that we that we
[53:50] are and everything that we want to be it
[53:52] doesn't come from some 12-step program
[53:54] somewhere but it comes from the message
[53:57] of the hour that's our home life that's
[53:59] our church life that's everything that
[54:01] we have so we want to enter into that
[54:03] land we want to partake of it not just
[54:06] hang around and say well it's a good
[54:07] land it's wonderful somebody ought to
[54:09] take of it no we ought to be the ones
[54:10] that take of it
[54:12] amen
[54:14] so brother random if you go all the way
[54:18] back to his Commission
[54:20] when he was laid the Cornerstone of the
[54:23] Tabernacle in Jeffersonville
[54:25] he had a vision that he was at the place
[54:27] where John the Baptist baptized people
[54:29] and that they had turned it into a hog
[54:31] lot
[54:32] and and you all know that the vision
[54:33] don't have time to read it all this
[54:35] morning but just to kind of give a
[54:36] background
[54:37] and then he saw his own Tabernacle full
[54:39] of people and and he was so happy to see
[54:42] it full but the angel told him he picked
[54:44] him up he said this is not your
[54:45] Tabernacle took him outdoors and set him
[54:48] under the sky
[54:49] and said the world is your Tabernacle
[54:52] and he showed him the fruit trees where
[54:54] he planted if you'll remember in two
[54:56] different buckets he planted each one he
[54:58] said the Oneness and the trinity in
[54:59] their own bucket
[55:01] right are you following me so far
[55:03] and he'd plant them in their own bucket
[55:05] and they grew up in the branches
[55:06] intertwined together he said in the
[55:08] fruit fell at the cross where the
[55:11] branches crossed
[55:12] and when he was coming out of the vision
[55:14] three times the angel spoke to him and
[55:16] said read second Timothy chapter four
[55:19] read second Timothy chapter four and
[55:21] when he did he read down through verse
[55:22] five and so I want to read that this
[55:24] morning he said I charge thee therefore
[55:25] before God and the Lord Jesus Christ who
[55:28] shall judge the quick and the dead and
[55:30] his appearing in his kingdom preach the
[55:32] word
[55:33] so this would be his commission not just
[55:36] to heal the sick although that was a
[55:38] commission that was given to him as well
[55:39] to go and and pray for God's sick
[55:42] children but now his commission would be
[55:44] to preach the word be instant in season
[55:47] out of season reprove rebuke exhort with
[55:49] all long-suffering and Doctrine for the
[55:52] time will come when they will not endure
[55:53] sound Doctrine we live in that age don't
[55:55] we but after their own lust or after
[55:58] their own desire shall they Heap to
[55:59] themselves teachers having itching ears
[56:01] and they shall turn away their ears from
[56:04] the truth and shall be turned unto
[56:06] fables he said but watch thou in all
[56:09] things endure afflictions do the work of
[56:12] an evangelist make full proof of your
[56:15] ministry and brother Branham did that
[56:17] excuse me
[56:19] it gets hot on this platform
[56:22] so he said do the work of an evangelist
[56:25] and that would be the first phase of his
[56:28] ministry so he recalls that commission
[56:31] and is this a sign of the answer and he
[56:34] says it's absolutely been fulfilled to
[56:37] the latter absolutely been fulfilled to
[56:40] the letter not one bit of it missed
[56:42] aren't you glad God kept his word
[56:45] God kept his word that there would be a
[56:47] Prophet come and he would have he would
[56:49] have the ability to do the work of an
[56:52] evangelist he would go and do that but
[56:54] he would preach the word
[56:55] all through that time he never got rid
[56:58] of that commission now he recalls that
[57:00] and he says it was fulfilled to the
[57:02] latter now his commission was to preach
[57:04] the word this would be the Capstone of
[57:06] his ministry not the healing campaigns
[57:09] but what we call again the opening of
[57:11] the word that's the phrase that brother
[57:12] Branham used it's not the first or the
[57:14] second pole but the third pole of his
[57:16] ministry remember he was standing there
[57:17] and he's fishing and the first bull
[57:19] attracted little bitty tiny fish and the
[57:21] second pole is just like a skin Over The
[57:24] Lure just a little bit bigger fish but
[57:25] he said the third poll attracted the big
[57:27] fish but he said when it did all the
[57:30] little fish scattered
[57:31] right and so the third poll was what
[57:34] brother Brandon said the third poll was
[57:36] uh the the opening of the seals and the
[57:38] opening of the word now brother random
[57:40] never refers to his ministry in that in
[57:43] during the time he's doing the work of
[57:45] an evangelist he doesn't refer to his
[57:46] ministry as a fulfillment of Revelation
[57:49] 10 7. did you know that if you go back
[57:52] and look and I know I'm just kind of
[57:53] teaching this morning but if you just
[57:54] bear with me a minute but the Branham
[57:56] doesn't he doesn't refer to that as far
[57:59] as I can tell until is this a sign of
[58:01] the answer
[58:02] and that's when you begin to bring out
[58:04] and preach he actually used his text
[58:06] from Revelation 10 1-7 in that in that
[58:09] message and that's when he begins to
[58:11] identify his message as the seventh
[58:13] Church age messenger and so he begins to
[58:16] identify that and and he says he said
[58:18] the seventh angel of Revelation 10 7 is
[58:21] the seventh Church age messenger so he
[58:24] he ties those two together and I know
[58:25] there's some people who still don't have
[58:27] a revelation of that still don't believe
[58:28] that but it is the truth he said is the
[58:31] seventh Church age messenger and I've
[58:33] I've uh edited some of this as far as
[58:36] taken out where he reads Revelation 10 7
[58:38] so you'll notice a little bit of of uh
[58:41] editing that I've done on that to make
[58:42] it clear on the on the slides now notice
[58:45] he said what was it notice his type of
[58:46] message he said finishing all the
[58:49] mysteries of God finishing
[58:51] huh wrapping up
[58:54] finishing all the mysteries of God that
[58:56] are written in the book
[58:58] he said the seventh angel is winding up
[59:00] all the Mysteries that's laying loose
[59:02] ended all out through these
[59:04] organizations and denominations I I
[59:06] heard an illustration of that and and I
[59:09] thought it was appropriate that when
[59:10] they when uh when it says it's finished
[59:12] if you look at that Greek word it's the
[59:14] idea of tying up all the knots tying up
[59:17] the Loose Ends and we be we don't really
[59:18] realize what that means but a ship
[59:21] before the semen could leave if they
[59:23] were going ashore they first had to tie
[59:25] all the Loose Ends there could be no uh
[59:28] no ropes hanging down there could be no
[59:31] rope hanging from the sale had to be
[59:33] tied up before they could go everything
[59:35] had to be in its place and that's what
[59:38] this message did oh I'm so glad for that
[59:40] today this message put us in our place
[59:42] it had to but Loose sins all had to be
[59:45] tied up he said the seventh Angels
[59:46] winding up all the Mysteries that's
[59:48] laying loose ended all out through these
[59:50] organizations and denominations the
[59:52] seventh angel gathers them up and
[59:54] finishes the entire mystery he said
[59:57] that's what the Bible said finishes The
[59:58] Mystery of the written book how many
[1:00:00] believe that today
[1:00:03] but you know when he preached it when he
[1:00:05] first began to preach it was a lot more
[1:00:06] difficult than what I'm doing this
[1:00:07] morning
[1:00:09] because what I'm doing is preaching to
[1:00:10] people who believe in a prophet
[1:00:12] right I believe that all of you do that
[1:00:14] you believe in a prophet you believe
[1:00:15] you're you believe in the message of the
[1:00:16] hour you believe in light that is shined
[1:00:18] in our day but he wasn't preaching to
[1:00:20] people who believed he was preaching to
[1:00:23] people who didn't know and many of them
[1:00:26] were unbelievers for make-believers and
[1:00:28] so he didn't he didn't know and or they
[1:00:30] didn't know what he was talking about
[1:00:32] and then when they they did the ones
[1:00:34] that did they didn't believe it
[1:00:36] and so he began to preach that word or
[1:00:38] to fulfill his commission people began
[1:00:40] to leave
[1:00:41] and if you go to 1962 again towards the
[1:00:44] end of the of the year he preaches
[1:00:46] Blasphemous names
[1:00:48] and he talks about
[1:00:51] having a vision where he's preached a
[1:00:54] long message that had two main points
[1:00:56] I'm going somewhere this morning so I'm
[1:00:58] kind of skipping through this but I
[1:01:00] I want you to I thought about coming out
[1:01:02] and just going full temperate this
[1:01:04] morning but I won't do it
[1:01:06] thank you you're welcome
[1:01:08] hahaha
[1:01:10] but uh I just can't do that I can't
[1:01:13] preach for two hours but but I'm going
[1:01:14] to try my best to get to the point and
[1:01:16] so you forgive me for skipping over some
[1:01:18] things but you can go back and study it
[1:01:19] or listen to the tape
[1:01:21] and so he said this uh he talked about
[1:01:24] this long message had two main points
[1:01:25] where he calls it two climaxes and the
[1:01:27] people stayed for the first one but he
[1:01:30] said then they got tired even
[1:01:31] illustrates that they yawned
[1:01:33] right they got tired and and hungry
[1:01:36] physically hungry he said they left he
[1:01:39] said well I'll come back when the
[1:01:40] evening Shadows come he said and then
[1:01:42] I'll I'll preach the rest of it he said
[1:01:44] in this first message when they'd see it
[1:01:46] everybody rallied for it said Oh Glory
[1:01:48] to God or if I could see this that or
[1:01:50] the other he said they go right away the
[1:01:53] same way they come in
[1:01:55] now watch they come to see a prophet
[1:01:57] they come to see somebody could reveal
[1:01:59] the secrets of the heart they come to
[1:02:00] see somebody who had the sign in the
[1:02:01] hand they come to receive their healing
[1:02:03] he said and they said Oh Glory to God if
[1:02:05] I could see this if I could see that but
[1:02:06] they went out the same way they come in
[1:02:08] he said and now they think well I don't
[1:02:10] know he said where would you join if I
[1:02:13] don't if I don't come to this it'll be
[1:02:15] this way and I'll be kicked out over
[1:02:17] here and I won't have nothing to hear he
[1:02:19] said Brethren sit down and say well what
[1:02:21] would I do see there they won't stop
[1:02:23] long enough to recognize it's the word
[1:02:25] that God promised being manifested and
[1:02:28] they walked away
[1:02:30] how many have done that that they would
[1:02:32] not stay and recognize that it's the
[1:02:35] word of God being manifested and they
[1:02:36] walked away he said but don't worry the
[1:02:39] Shadows are close at hand when I return
[1:02:41] to the field now this was 1962. uh
[1:02:44] November 4th now I want you to
[1:02:47] understand today I'm not looking for
[1:02:48] brother random to come back and do that
[1:02:50] he did that
[1:02:51] you understand he did that he he did
[1:02:54] what he God promised that he would do
[1:02:55] because the book is open just like
[1:02:58] Joshua did what he God promised he would
[1:03:00] do just like Moses did what God promised
[1:03:02] he would do so he then uh you know he
[1:03:05] gets in Blasphemous names he realizes
[1:03:07] these people are leaving and you'll find
[1:03:09] this also in the present stage of my
[1:03:11] Ministry and many different sermons that
[1:03:13] he preaches during that time
[1:03:15] and he had read through verse 5 of
[1:03:18] second Timothy chapter four
[1:03:20] and he begins though to first for the
[1:03:22] first time he said I read on down at
[1:03:25] least the first time thinking about this
[1:03:26] he said I'm now ready to be offered and
[1:03:30] the time of my departure is at hand
[1:03:32] so Paul was telling Timothy preach the
[1:03:34] word but now he says there's coming a
[1:03:36] time I've got to leave the field
[1:03:38] and you can read the rest of it but in
[1:03:40] verse 10 it said for demons has forsaken
[1:03:42] me having loved this present world and
[1:03:45] it's departed unto thessalonica
[1:03:46] questions to galatia Titus unto Dalmatia
[1:03:50] and I I'll tell you that you know we we
[1:03:54] underestimate sometimes how how big and
[1:03:56] how much of an impact those early
[1:03:57] meetings had on people
[1:03:59] it was a major Ministry
[1:04:02] but most of them left
[1:04:05] the majority left
[1:04:07] many people that were healed never
[1:04:09] believed the message
[1:04:11] many people that were saved during that
[1:04:13] time never believed the message
[1:04:15] never could come to the message of the
[1:04:17] hour most would leave but some would
[1:04:20] stay
[1:04:21] now in is this the sign of the answer
[1:04:24] Junior Jackson had a dream and there was
[1:04:27] a number of dreams I believe there were
[1:04:28] seven dreams that brother Brandon talks
[1:04:29] about there and the last one was his own
[1:04:32] and one of them was Junior Jackson's
[1:04:34] dream and he said I dreamed that there
[1:04:35] was a great big hill he said like out in
[1:04:37] the field where Bluegrass or something
[1:04:39] was he said up on top this hill where
[1:04:42] the water had washed away the soil he
[1:04:44] said there was a top rock up on top of
[1:04:45] the hill like the top of the mountain if
[1:04:47] you've ever been to some mountains on
[1:04:48] top there's nothing that grows it's a
[1:04:50] it's a Capstone of the mountain it's
[1:04:52] it's a place where it's too high for
[1:04:53] anything to grow or a bold we call
[1:04:55] around here a knob a Bald Knob and so
[1:04:58] it's a place where there's no grass and
[1:05:00] and it just rock and he said where the
[1:05:03] water had washed down and cut some kind
[1:05:05] of readings on these Stones he said you
[1:05:07] were standing there interpreting this
[1:05:10] reading on these stones and said all of
[1:05:12] us and here's the way he put it the
[1:05:14] Brethren from Georgia and from all
[1:05:16] around we were all standing together
[1:05:18] listening to you interpret that
[1:05:20] mysterious writing on those stone that
[1:05:23] mountain and said then you picked up
[1:05:25] something like from the air something
[1:05:27] like a wrecking bar or a crowbar
[1:05:29] something like that A Wrecking Bar real
[1:05:31] sharp and it said how you've done it I
[1:05:33] don't know he said you struck the top of
[1:05:35] that mountain ripped it around and
[1:05:36] lifted the cap of it off
[1:05:38] you know it has to have a spiritual
[1:05:39] meaning right
[1:05:41] he said it was in the shape of a pyramid
[1:05:43] and you rip the top of it off he said
[1:05:46] beneath that was White Stone Granite and
[1:05:48] you said the son of the light has never
[1:05:50] shined on this before now notice it was
[1:05:52] a part of the mountain but it was a part
[1:05:54] The sun hadn't shown on apart the people
[1:05:57] didn't understand
[1:05:59] but there will come a day that the wives
[1:06:00] will understand the Bible says he said
[1:06:03] seal it up to the time of the end well
[1:06:05] guess what guess where we're at if you
[1:06:07] haven't noticed lately we're at the time
[1:06:09] of the end but we're not at the time of
[1:06:10] the end waiting on the final Messenger
[1:06:12] to come we've had the final messenger
[1:06:14] the final voice to the final we've had
[1:06:17] it and now we've got to live that and
[1:06:19] become that final voice
[1:06:21] you understand
[1:06:22] now
[1:06:23] he said the son of the light has never
[1:06:26] shine on this before he said look upon
[1:06:28] this
[1:06:29] hopefully if my Ministry could be
[1:06:32] encapsulated in one thing again I can't
[1:06:34] be I can't be everything to I can't be
[1:06:37] all things to all people not everybody's
[1:06:39] going to understand it but if we could
[1:06:41] stand there at that stone that's been
[1:06:42] uncovered and stand there and say look
[1:06:45] on this
[1:06:47] huh
[1:06:48] and then I'll stand there and say you
[1:06:50] know and look on it ourselves
[1:06:53] right because the preacher can't preach
[1:06:55] what he doesn't know
[1:06:57] right look on it but not just me to look
[1:06:59] on it but you to look on it that's the
[1:07:01] message of the hour that's the light
[1:07:04] that's come on the scriptures
[1:07:06] and so he's pointing to the scriptures
[1:07:07] that have now been revealed said look on
[1:07:10] this
[1:07:10] and there's your healing and there's
[1:07:13] your salvation and there's how to have
[1:07:15] church
[1:07:16] right and so I've told people you know I
[1:07:19] Don't Preach because uh because a
[1:07:21] prophet in spite of a prophet I preach
[1:07:23] because of a prophet brother Branham
[1:07:25] told us how to have church
[1:07:27] he taught us how to have church he
[1:07:28] taught us how to how to praise the God
[1:07:30] how to worship and how to have things
[1:07:32] decently and in order I've got to stay
[1:07:34] with that he said look on this
[1:07:37] huh and he said then uh brother Branham
[1:07:41] left
[1:07:42] and said he went over the hills towards
[1:07:44] the west and he got smaller as he went
[1:07:47] and he and he said then when I did that
[1:07:49] he said then the Brethren turned around
[1:07:51] after a while and said did he vanish
[1:07:53] where did he go and said some took out
[1:07:57] that way
[1:07:58] some took one way and some another but a
[1:08:01] very few stayed
[1:08:03] oh I want to be one this state don't you
[1:08:05] a very few stayed and looked onto what I
[1:08:08] had told them what I had told them now
[1:08:11] it was not the action of staying but the
[1:08:13] action of looking doing what he told
[1:08:16] them to do was the obedience to a
[1:08:18] prophet's voice now if you'd stood there
[1:08:19] and watched the prophet
[1:08:21] leave you wouldn't have been doing what
[1:08:23] he told you to do
[1:08:25] he said look on this
[1:08:27] oh that's what I want to do this morning
[1:08:29] look on this Elevate the word make the
[1:08:31] word preeminent
[1:08:33] amen
[1:08:35] amen now
[1:08:37] we know when the Seven Seals was
[1:08:39] revealed it opened the entire book
[1:08:41] it opened the entire book
[1:08:44] the opening of the book where the
[1:08:45] Branham taught us that the whole book
[1:08:47] was a new book we'll read it after a
[1:08:48] while he said the opening of the book
[1:08:50] was more than just the series of sermons
[1:08:53] and and I want you to understand this
[1:08:55] this morning if you don't understand
[1:08:56] anything else
[1:08:57] when we talk about the opening of the
[1:08:59] seals or the opening of the book or we
[1:09:03] talk about light on on the scriptures
[1:09:04] and we talk about the message of the
[1:09:06] hour this is what we're talking about
[1:09:08] we're talking about the Bible
[1:09:11] right that's been opened up
[1:09:13] so and so brother Brandon and it's an
[1:09:16] entire message
[1:09:18] and and maybe if you differ with me on
[1:09:19] this you just go right ahead and believe
[1:09:21] and you just stay with the message of
[1:09:23] the hour but this I believe that it's
[1:09:26] the entire message the revelation of the
[1:09:28] Seven Seals it's not just a series of
[1:09:30] seven sermons
[1:09:32] and I believe brother Branham taught
[1:09:34] that now
[1:09:35] if we look at that you look at what was
[1:09:37] revealed and I've taken you before
[1:09:39] through the Mysteries but the random
[1:09:40] list is this the side of the answer he
[1:09:42] reads out of his Scofield bible and he
[1:09:43] reads all the Mysteries that were
[1:09:44] revealed and then he adds some to them
[1:09:47] were revealed at the end time you
[1:09:48] remember that and I we've dealt with
[1:09:50] that before and I want to deal with a
[1:09:51] little bit differently this morning but
[1:09:53] there's several statements that brother
[1:09:54] Branham makes that that he tells us what
[1:09:56] was revealed under the opening of the
[1:09:58] seals
[1:09:59] right and so it wasn't just a white
[1:10:01] horse rider a black horse rider a red
[1:10:03] horse rider but brother Branham taught
[1:10:05] us that the church Ages were revealed
[1:10:07] under the opening of the seals
[1:10:11] he said immediately he's talking about
[1:10:13] uh The Sword in his hand I remember the
[1:10:16] story he took the sword sword struck his
[1:10:18] hand he said it's the king's sword
[1:10:20] right I know we're deep this morning I
[1:10:22] don't do this very often but just just
[1:10:23] hang with me he said it was a king's
[1:10:25] sword the king's sword he didn't
[1:10:27] understand what it was and but then he
[1:10:30] said it was the word
[1:10:31] right the word was in his hand
[1:10:34] right and he said this is that third
[1:10:36] pull
[1:10:37] you go back and look at the vision
[1:10:39] or or the the things that happened to it
[1:10:41] he said he felt like a real a real sword
[1:10:43] struck his hand so he tells that story
[1:10:45] he said immediately after that the
[1:10:46] angels of the Lord appeared and told
[1:10:48] about the Seven Seals I was to return
[1:10:50] back here to Jeffersonville and preach
[1:10:51] the Seven Seals he said in there if I
[1:10:54] ever said anything that was inspired it
[1:10:55] was in that he said there's where the
[1:10:58] angel of the Lord met us and the Bible
[1:11:00] become a new Bible
[1:11:02] there it opened up and revealed all the
[1:11:05] things that the reformers and things had
[1:11:07] left out he said it was the complete
[1:11:09] revelation of Jesus Christ all together
[1:11:12] new to us
[1:11:14] but perfectly exactly with the scripture
[1:11:18] that was the word which has always been
[1:11:20] I love this I was so inspired and
[1:11:23] directed now he goes on to talk about
[1:11:25] the trumpets he says the trumpets were
[1:11:27] not profitable to the church because
[1:11:29] they were to the Jews and we all
[1:11:30] understand that
[1:11:32] he said now the hidden mysteries of
[1:11:33] Christ was fully revealed someone say
[1:11:36] fully revealed
[1:11:37] fully revealed in the Seven Seals he
[1:11:40] said it revealed first the seven Church
[1:11:43] ages
[1:11:45] now think about that the seals revealed
[1:11:48] for it's the opening of the word
[1:11:50] right it's not just seven sermons
[1:11:53] but it's opening up it's bringing light
[1:11:55] to when the book is closed there's no
[1:11:57] light on it but when it's open the light
[1:11:59] comes on it you can read what's inside
[1:12:02] and so now he said it revealed first the
[1:12:04] seven churches opened up the ages and
[1:12:07] placed them positionally both with
[1:12:09] history and with the Bible and set them
[1:12:11] in position how they was
[1:12:14] right and this is why I don't get caught
[1:12:15] up in dates and certain things that
[1:12:17] people say well this is the time when
[1:12:18] the the angel or the lamb left the
[1:12:22] throne and this is the day that this
[1:12:23] happened I don't get caught up in that
[1:12:24] because we realize it's all the opening
[1:12:26] of the word
[1:12:28] right some things brother random even
[1:12:30] taught before the seals were open but if
[1:12:32] you watch it there's more and more light
[1:12:34] as it comes down to the end until we can
[1:12:36] just see perfectly Where We Are
[1:12:38] now so he said he said both he said open
[1:12:41] up the ages place them positionally both
[1:12:43] with history and with the Bible and set
[1:12:46] them in position how they was
[1:12:48] so the church Ages were open under the
[1:12:50] seals what else was open heaven
[1:12:53] was open to us
[1:12:55] what heaven was
[1:12:57] I love this he said I do not think that
[1:13:00] heaven is a place that my mother used to
[1:13:02] tell me about I believe the church has
[1:13:05] grown from that
[1:13:06] to think it used to be a hundred years
[1:13:08] ago or two he said I think the
[1:13:10] old-timers used to think that everyone
[1:13:11] had died that died went up to heaven and
[1:13:14] had a harp and set up there on the
[1:13:15] clouds and played a heart now that that
[1:13:18] sounds good for a while
[1:13:21] but after a while you get tired of
[1:13:23] playing a harp
[1:13:24] I mean Peter can play them drums and
[1:13:26] that bass and that guitar and that piano
[1:13:28] he's got in the basement for a long time
[1:13:30] he's got him a whole band set up down
[1:13:32] there of confiscated instruments so he
[1:13:34] just found her
[1:13:35] or some of them are mine some of them I
[1:13:38] think someone belong to church but we
[1:13:39] have to work on that but but he's got
[1:13:41] he's got instruments down there and and
[1:13:44] uh he got him a sound system he loves to
[1:13:46] play but after a few million years
[1:13:50] and you might get tired of that but
[1:13:52] that's not all heaven is
[1:13:54] and so but the random even talked about
[1:13:56] how he thought that they were just
[1:13:57] spirits and they could say hi brother
[1:13:59] Neville but he could never shake his
[1:14:00] hand
[1:14:02] right he said now they know that there
[1:14:05] was a place called heaven but they he
[1:14:07] said if that be so he said all the
[1:14:09] musicians would have it on us
[1:14:11] he said but it isn't that kind of a
[1:14:12] place
[1:14:13] it isn't playing Harps at all he said I
[1:14:15] believe I don't believe the Bible
[1:14:17] teaches that he said but that was a
[1:14:19] conception that they had before the
[1:14:21] fullness of the word came into existence
[1:14:24] or the opening of The Seven Seals that's
[1:14:26] promised us in this age that we then
[1:14:29] understand aren't you glad for
[1:14:31] understanding but when did Brother
[1:14:32] random go beyond the curtain of time if
[1:14:33] you go back and look at the sermon
[1:14:35] beyond the curtain of time he said I
[1:14:36] believe it's 1962.
[1:14:39] now it's before he preached the seven
[1:14:41] sermons right
[1:14:43] and we know that he didn't even know
[1:14:44] what those were yet but you're watching
[1:14:45] the light come on
[1:14:47] the lights coming on it's getting
[1:14:49] brighter it's getting brighter and all
[1:14:50] of those things become perfected under
[1:14:53] all those teachings become perfected
[1:14:55] under the opening of the word now can we
[1:14:57] go on this morning
[1:14:58] so the church ages the uh Heaven itself
[1:15:02] serpent seat is another one he said you
[1:15:05] people follow these tapes with our
[1:15:07] brother here he said now you've heard me
[1:15:08] preach on the serpent seed that that
[1:15:10] cannot be denied
[1:15:12] he said that was opened up in one of
[1:15:14] those Seven Seals
[1:15:17] he preached Serpentine I believe in 1959
[1:15:19] if I'm not mistaken brother Brandon says
[1:15:22] that by the way more than once several
[1:15:23] times
[1:15:24] serpent seed was open under the seals
[1:15:27] now
[1:15:28] again what what is it God's doing
[1:15:31] something
[1:15:32] that was his job
[1:15:34] what's to what's to take the book from
[1:15:37] the lamb who opened it the lamb opened
[1:15:38] the book and he said he gave it to his
[1:15:40] servant the seventh angel and he showed
[1:15:43] it to us
[1:15:44] uh what does this message mean it means
[1:15:46] everything
[1:15:48] right it's light on the on the
[1:15:49] scriptures now again election and
[1:15:52] serpency goes into election because if
[1:15:54] you don't understand serpency you don't
[1:15:56] understand election correctly so that's
[1:15:58] what serpency in fact I think that's why
[1:16:00] we know serpent seed as it is and it was
[1:16:02] hidden in previous ages is because the
[1:16:05] reason we know what it is is because of
[1:16:07] election we have to know who we are
[1:16:09] in this hour we are we're the seed of
[1:16:12] God the spiritual seed of God now uh he
[1:16:15] talks about the seven angels and how
[1:16:17] they come down in the cloud he said I've
[1:16:19] seen then what it was he said well as
[1:16:22] soon as I got my commission in the
[1:16:23] scripture he said the Seven Seals which
[1:16:25] is the seven Mysteries now he goes on he
[1:16:29] talks about how he tells this story
[1:16:31] several times that a man come to him and
[1:16:32] told him his brother Brandon want those
[1:16:34] seven Thunders he said be some great
[1:16:36] thing that's not written in the book
[1:16:37] you've heard him tell that we've read it
[1:16:39] before he sent me some great new mystery
[1:16:42] I said it can't be that way because see
[1:16:44] I believe the word to be the truth how
[1:16:46] many believe that this morning it all
[1:16:48] goes back to the Bible I believe the
[1:16:50] word to be the truth and the Bible said
[1:16:52] whosoever shall add one word or take one
[1:16:54] word from it it has to be in this word
[1:16:57] it's the Mysteries that the people has
[1:16:59] overlooked for right there is where come
[1:17:02] my message of serpentine and the true
[1:17:04] belief of the security of the believer
[1:17:08] he said I'm not disgrading my
[1:17:10] Presbyterian Brethren there and some of
[1:17:13] you Baptist Brethren on the way that you
[1:17:15] have security I'm not saying this to be
[1:17:17] different but you didn't have it just
[1:17:19] right
[1:17:19] he said that's right but I had it wrong
[1:17:21] too
[1:17:23] that's what he said I had it wrong too
[1:17:25] but when an angel stands from heaven and
[1:17:28] tells you and here it is right in the
[1:17:30] scripture that's true
[1:17:33] Glory so it takes both you understand
[1:17:35] and listen it takes both with us too a
[1:17:39] pastor can stand here and preach it can
[1:17:41] teach it can explain it to you some a
[1:17:42] whole lot better than me but if they can
[1:17:44] stand here and tell you that's part of
[1:17:46] it
[1:17:47] but the Holy Ghost has to reveal it to
[1:17:50] you
[1:17:51] so both sides he said an angel came down
[1:17:53] but he said if that angel came and told
[1:17:55] me something that wasn't in the Bible I
[1:17:56] wouldn't believe it but he come down he
[1:17:58] showed him where in the Bible to find it
[1:18:01] and so that's what I challenge you to do
[1:18:03] that there's something you don't
[1:18:04] understand about the message of the hour
[1:18:05] some of you young people even trip
[1:18:07] sitting here and and Esther and and
[1:18:10] Peter uh that are back there working and
[1:18:12] some of you younger couples that maybe
[1:18:14] some of you that are watching if you
[1:18:16] don't understand something about the
[1:18:17] message go back to the scripture
[1:18:20] and find where he got it in the
[1:18:22] scripture and then if you can't find it
[1:18:24] come talk to me
[1:18:26] come talk to me or talk to one of these
[1:18:27] other minister brothers that can show
[1:18:29] you where it's at because it's there
[1:18:32] it's there you need to know the
[1:18:34] scriptures and you need to you need to
[1:18:36] be digging in the message of the hour
[1:18:37] because there's something there for you
[1:18:38] there's something that'll help you at
[1:18:40] school
[1:18:41] there's things in there that'll help you
[1:18:42] at work see this message again it's not
[1:18:44] just seven sermons preach I had somebody
[1:18:47] tell me the other day said well it was
[1:18:48] mostly about the Catholic Church you
[1:18:50] know it was about me
[1:18:52] I saw my name there
[1:18:55] identity I found him in the opening of
[1:18:57] that word
[1:18:58] Hallelujah I can't be anything else it's
[1:19:01] hard to unsee it but the spirit once you
[1:19:03] can see it you're looking at it that's
[1:19:05] me
[1:19:06] like like the little uh the little boy
[1:19:08] looking in the mirror he said Mama
[1:19:09] that's me
[1:19:11] it's open
[1:19:12] it belongs to me the public didn't know
[1:19:15] it but I I looked at it and all of a
[1:19:17] sudden it was revealed to my heart
[1:19:20] amen
[1:19:21] but he said he always speaks exactly
[1:19:23] with the scripture
[1:19:24] the word is always right
[1:19:28] and I've told you before scripture
[1:19:29] should stand on its own
[1:19:32] we shouldn't have to say well I don't
[1:19:34] believe in Preachers anymore scripture
[1:19:36] should stand on its own Ephesians 4 11
[1:19:38] shouldn't have to be denied or explained
[1:19:41] away and a prophet didn't do it
[1:19:44] right a word Prophet doesn't do that and
[1:19:46] now you could take any other thing that
[1:19:48] we believe it's not just that but it
[1:19:49] shouldn't be explained away whatever the
[1:19:52] scripture said how the scripture said to
[1:19:53] have communion brother Brandon brings
[1:19:54] light on that
[1:19:56] how the scripture says they have church
[1:19:58] brother man brings light on that
[1:20:00] how the opening of the seals the things
[1:20:02] we didn't understand over the years he
[1:20:04] brought light on those scriptures now we
[1:20:07] know what they are
[1:20:09] right now
[1:20:10] look but the word is always right we
[1:20:13] just needed that top of the mountain
[1:20:14] pried off
[1:20:16] you understand so we can see
[1:20:18] what else did he tell us the Book of
[1:20:20] Life
[1:20:21] you go back and look at that it sounds
[1:20:22] confusing if you go to the church age
[1:20:24] book you find brother random talking
[1:20:26] about it in a certain way and and
[1:20:28] brother Branham explains what he meant
[1:20:30] in the church each book later on in
[1:20:31] worse is Faith expressed he talks about
[1:20:33] that book he said there's only really
[1:20:35] one book of life
[1:20:36] and he goes on to some detailed
[1:20:38] explanation and talks about the uh the
[1:20:40] wheat and and the and the Chuck and all
[1:20:42] of those things he talked about the
[1:20:43] different parts of it he said but
[1:20:44] there's only one book of life
[1:20:46] he said so that's where it is it's all
[1:20:48] in that great Revelation there and he
[1:20:50] talks about the different parts you
[1:20:51] understand there's a there's a bride
[1:20:53] part there's a part there that their
[1:20:55] name will never be taken out of the book
[1:20:56] aren't you glad to be part of that
[1:20:58] amen the Lamb's Book of Life that'll
[1:21:00] never be taken out of the book
[1:21:02] but he said so that's where it is it's
[1:21:04] all in that great Revelation there which
[1:21:06] was made known during the time of the
[1:21:09] Seven Seals
[1:21:10] made known during the time of the Seven
[1:21:12] Seals I don't remember him talking about
[1:21:14] the book of life during the seals and he
[1:21:15] may have mentioned it I don't remember
[1:21:17] him talking about that but it's that
[1:21:18] opening of the word again it's like
[1:21:20] Joshua going in and Jericho is the key
[1:21:23] to the to Canaan and he walks in and and
[1:21:26] uh here's the walls around Jericho and
[1:21:28] he walks in they walk around seven times
[1:21:30] and the seventh day they walked around
[1:21:31] or six times the seventh day they walked
[1:21:33] around seven times and when they finally
[1:21:36] walked around at that final time there
[1:21:37] was a shout the people made a shout and
[1:21:39] when the shout came then the walls fell
[1:21:41] down and now Canaan was open to them I
[1:21:45] believe that that's happened in our day
[1:21:46] that our Joshua Ministry has come and I
[1:21:49] believe that's that's a Prophet by the
[1:21:51] way and I'm going to show you that after
[1:21:52] a while but that was a prophet's
[1:21:54] Ministry it was our Joshua Ministry also
[1:21:56] a type of the Holy Ghost
[1:21:57] but it's a type of our prophet's
[1:21:59] Ministry and he walked in and the walls
[1:22:01] come down but where are we at what are
[1:22:04] we supposed to do go in and take the
[1:22:06] land
[1:22:07] how the walls have come down let's not
[1:22:09] rebuild the walls we read that to you
[1:22:10] last week Kirsten is the man that
[1:22:12] rebuilds the walls he loses family if he
[1:22:15] rebuilds the walls
[1:22:16] church if you rebuild the walls of
[1:22:18] denominationalism if you rebuild the
[1:22:20] walls of Catholicism till some Pope
[1:22:22] somewhere can tell you what to do until
[1:22:24] a sovereign Church what to do and how to
[1:22:26] act when you rebuild those woes you lose
[1:22:28] your kids
[1:22:30] a hundred percent of the time but we've
[1:22:32] been called to Freedom we've been called
[1:22:34] to an open land it's yours go take it
[1:22:38] are you with me this morning
[1:22:40] amen
[1:22:42] so marriage and divorce is another thing
[1:22:45] he said now you see what happened there
[1:22:47] in marriage and divorce the Seven Seals
[1:22:49] was opened and brought out the real
[1:22:50] truth of it
[1:22:52] oh my aren't you glad for that and
[1:22:54] people say well that's condemning no it
[1:22:56] it gave a way out
[1:22:58] it gave Grace aren't you glad for Grace
[1:23:00] today
[1:23:02] amen told us the truth of it so our
[1:23:05] children wouldn't have to go through
[1:23:06] that so we could preach tell our
[1:23:08] children the truth
[1:23:10] amen
[1:23:11] marriage is for life
[1:23:14] now look it wasn't so from the beginning
[1:23:16] polygamy wasn't so from the beginning
[1:23:18] you get one one shot at it oh I'm so
[1:23:21] glad that God has a way he said I don't
[1:23:23] know what to do I don't know who to
[1:23:24] marry God has a way to lead you and
[1:23:26] guide you to the right one
[1:23:28] you just you just pray and get in the
[1:23:30] word God will take care of the rest of
[1:23:31] it aren't you glad of that today I never
[1:23:34] thought Nolan levi'd be married
[1:23:36] but here they are this morning in church
[1:23:37] the kids grew up uh and brother obvious
[1:23:41] when I was there and I I never thought
[1:23:43] that that would happen but God knows
[1:23:44] what he's doing
[1:23:46] and we don't know I don't think Noli
[1:23:47] ever thought that would happen I don't
[1:23:49] know about Levi but
[1:23:53] only in my dreams right
[1:23:57] but God has a way
[1:23:59] here this morning but God put them
[1:24:01] together I don't know why I'm talking
[1:24:02] about this but I see my own kids get a
[1:24:05] little bit older and begin to think
[1:24:06] about these things and God has a way you
[1:24:08] just say in the word you stay in church
[1:24:11] stay with God God has a way of bringing
[1:24:13] you to the right one
[1:24:15] amen
[1:24:16] baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:24:18] Christ was another one you remember
[1:24:20] there's a distinction there not just in
[1:24:21] Jesus name because people had that
[1:24:24] but brother Brandon tells the story the
[1:24:26] same story about that man that come and
[1:24:27] said want to be something great that
[1:24:29] comes he I said no sir it can't be
[1:24:30] because the Bible the Seven Seals on it
[1:24:33] had the seven Mysteries hid he said it
[1:24:35] was already wrote but they didn't
[1:24:36] understand what it was
[1:24:38] and he goes on he said watch how they
[1:24:40] plowed along with that being baptized in
[1:24:43] Jesus name he said see that wasn't it
[1:24:46] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ aren't
[1:24:48] you glad to know that today we can have
[1:24:50] confidence in it and he preached that
[1:24:53] his entire Ministry almost but it was
[1:24:55] yet it was in the opening of the word
[1:24:57] all the hidden mysteries were revealed
[1:24:59] and more light shine as he come fully
[1:25:03] into his ministry now look we could go
[1:25:04] on and on and I don't have time this
[1:25:06] morning but we could go into church
[1:25:08] order we could go into the fivefold
[1:25:10] ministry we could go into tribulation
[1:25:12] period these are not things that we can
[1:25:14] just mess with this is the opening of
[1:25:16] the word
[1:25:17] this is what he taught
[1:25:19] the tribulation period the future home
[1:25:21] aren't you glad you know what your
[1:25:22] future home is
[1:25:24] hey man the Rapture uh the order of the
[1:25:27] family the place of a man and a woman
[1:25:30] we didn't don't just go back and change
[1:25:31] those things
[1:25:33] those things belong to us that's our
[1:25:35] land that's our possession
[1:25:38] communion
[1:25:40] and it's such a thing that's been left
[1:25:42] out in many places but I've tried to
[1:25:44] have it more regularly because it means
[1:25:45] something it's there for a reason we do
[1:25:48] it for a reason don't let it just become
[1:25:50] a something we do but let's do it for
[1:25:52] the right reasons we were taught how to
[1:25:55] have communion we were taught about
[1:25:57] Divine Healing
[1:25:58] if you're sick this morning we were
[1:26:00] taught about how to believe like a
[1:26:02] gentile believer if you're not here this
[1:26:04] morning say well I can't have hands laid
[1:26:05] on you but you're a gentile you say
[1:26:07] speak the word
[1:26:09] speak the word and my family can be
[1:26:10] healed
[1:26:11] we've been taught about our families and
[1:26:13] how that they'll come back and our
[1:26:15] children aren't you glad you heard that
[1:26:16] last Sunday night what a wonderful what
[1:26:18] a marvelous messages brother Joel
[1:26:19] preached about about how that our
[1:26:21] families we have a right to our families
[1:26:23] and they'll be coming back and and he
[1:26:25] didn't say how but he said they would
[1:26:27] and and so that was revealed to us under
[1:26:30] the opening of the word under this
[1:26:31] message of the hour I'm going to hold on
[1:26:33] to that I'm not going to take that
[1:26:35] lightly I believe in that
[1:26:39] hey man
[1:26:41] we think
[1:26:43] we get the feeling sometimes I to be
[1:26:45] people that have left the message you
[1:26:46] just indulge me for a moment
[1:26:48] some of these people that have left the
[1:26:50] message it gets feeling like and they'll
[1:26:52] use this they say well brother Brandon
[1:26:53] was a false anointed one well you didn't
[1:26:54] even know what a false anointed one was
[1:26:58] without this message
[1:27:02] you're using a message Doctrine to try
[1:27:03] to disprove a prophet
[1:27:08] right I mean they just don't even
[1:27:11] understand we take it for granted
[1:27:13] sometimes
[1:27:14] I want us to know he kept his word
[1:27:19] amen
[1:27:20] he said then back out there at the
[1:27:22] beginning of the Seven Seals when those
[1:27:24] seven angels come down in that pyramid
[1:27:26] form stood there and told me to return
[1:27:28] back here and speak on those Seven Seals
[1:27:30] and he'd be with me
[1:27:32] amen he said he'd show me what they were
[1:27:35] the lost things he'd show me what they
[1:27:39] were the lost things you know again he
[1:27:43] said it couldn't be something not
[1:27:44] written but he goes on down he said so
[1:27:46] it is a mystery it's been in the book in
[1:27:48] these seven Church ages
[1:27:50] each one of them produced a mystery all
[1:27:53] about water baptism and these other
[1:27:54] things that they fumbled about so long
[1:27:57] but I'm so glad for the opening of the
[1:27:59] word today I'm so glad for the opening
[1:28:00] of the seals so we can see the book is
[1:28:02] open and my name is there it didn't just
[1:28:05] open up it didn't just open up the uh
[1:28:08] the scriptures but it opened up who I am
[1:28:10] in the scriptures
[1:28:12] where I belong
[1:28:14] so now
[1:28:16] again another term we use for that is
[1:28:18] the seven Thunders I know people are
[1:28:19] scared of that because people come along
[1:28:21] and taught that the Thunders were the
[1:28:22] virtues but brother Branham said the
[1:28:24] Thunders were the Mysteries that were
[1:28:26] hidden under the seals
[1:28:28] all right revealed under the seals and
[1:28:31] so a thunder is a voice look at
[1:28:33] Revelation 10-1 it says I saw another
[1:28:35] Mighty Angel come down from heaven
[1:28:36] clothed with the cloud and the rainbow
[1:28:38] was upon his head and his face was as it
[1:28:40] were the sun his feet is pillars of fire
[1:28:42] he had on his hand a little book open he
[1:28:44] said his right foot upon the sea and his
[1:28:46] left foot on the earth and he cried with
[1:28:48] a loud voice is when a lion roarth and
[1:28:50] when he had cried seven Thunders out of
[1:28:52] their voices
[1:28:53] now Thunder is a voice that was not
[1:28:56] understood
[1:28:57] but now John understood it but but the
[1:29:00] Thunder he started to write he said
[1:29:02] don't write it
[1:29:03] but the voice was a thunder you find
[1:29:05] that in John 12 29 brother Branham uses
[1:29:07] this example the people therefore that
[1:29:09] stood by and heard it said that it
[1:29:11] thundered remember when he said I both
[1:29:13] I've glorified he said father glorify
[1:29:14] thy name he said I've glorified it we'll
[1:29:16] glorify it again and what was it was a
[1:29:18] thunder
[1:29:19] and and but but to him it was The Voice
[1:29:22] it was revealed to him and brother
[1:29:24] Branham goes on about that he said it's
[1:29:26] all revealed in there he said in the
[1:29:28] Seven Seals opened up the revelation of
[1:29:31] what that was
[1:29:33] are you with me now you go back and get
[1:29:35] the whole quote
[1:29:37] now look
[1:29:38] so I want to present to you today this
[1:29:41] way he kept his word
[1:29:44] can you say Amen to that I talked to you
[1:29:47] last week and said he kept his word in
[1:29:48] our church we've seen him do it I've
[1:29:50] seen him keep his word it's not just
[1:29:51] about us we're part of a body a global
[1:29:54] body of Believers we may not all agree
[1:29:56] on every little thing but we're there's
[1:29:58] there's a bride out there somewhere
[1:30:00] there's got to be he keeps his word
[1:30:03] and we're part of that bride he kept his
[1:30:06] word the book is open and it can't be
[1:30:08] closed back up that we can't rebuild the
[1:30:10] walls we come into the land
[1:30:12] and he opened the land to Joshua and he
[1:30:15] told he told Brother Branham he said
[1:30:17] preach the word that's what he told him
[1:30:19] he said go to second second Timothy 4 go
[1:30:21] to Second Timothy 4 preach the word be
[1:30:24] instant in season of the season and and
[1:30:26] he told Joshua he said be strong and of
[1:30:28] a good courage for under this people
[1:30:30] shalt thou divide for an inheritance to
[1:30:32] land which I swear unto their fathers to
[1:30:34] give them only be thou strong and very
[1:30:36] courageous the thou mayest observed to
[1:30:39] do according to all the law which Moses
[1:30:41] my servant commanded thee turn not from
[1:30:43] it to the right hand or to the left that
[1:30:45] means Prosper with or so ever thou goeth
[1:30:48] what was he doing he was telling him
[1:30:49] this is this is what I want you to do
[1:30:52] Joshua this is your commission preach
[1:30:54] the word
[1:30:56] divide the land
[1:30:58] which that Paul calls us he calls the
[1:31:01] ministry he said as stewards we are
[1:31:02] stewards of the mysteries of God a
[1:31:04] steward is a is one who divides an
[1:31:06] inheritance
[1:31:08] he set up over a family and he goes in
[1:31:10] and he takes the family he gives so much
[1:31:12] to the servants and so much to the
[1:31:14] household and his job is to be like an
[1:31:16] accountant he he goes over everything
[1:31:18] and he he finds out what belongs here
[1:31:20] what belongs there and that's where the
[1:31:22] ministry is important because our job is
[1:31:24] to is to rightly divide the word
[1:31:27] right and but not to take it away from
[1:31:29] its original meaning but to take that
[1:31:31] part of the word and say I'll just make
[1:31:32] it simple like someone is here maybe
[1:31:34] they're suffering with uh something
[1:31:36] that's happened in their family and the
[1:31:38] ministry under the inspiration of the
[1:31:39] Holy Ghost God anoints them to preach
[1:31:41] and and they begin to preach about the
[1:31:43] family and they begin to preach about
[1:31:44] things like that and that person in
[1:31:46] their heart just begins to be struck
[1:31:47] because they realize I didn't talk to
[1:31:49] that preacher I didn't tell him what was
[1:31:51] going on but what's he doing he's taking
[1:31:52] the word but he's dividing to you the
[1:31:55] portion that you needed that Sunday
[1:31:56] morning the portion that you needed on
[1:31:58] that Wednesday night that's what we do
[1:32:00] it's not our word it's not our light
[1:32:02] we're just reflecting the light that
[1:32:04] come in our day but we're stewards of
[1:32:07] the mysteries of God dividing each
[1:32:09] portion and we have to be really careful
[1:32:10] with that because we're not using our
[1:32:12] word
[1:32:13] we're using his word
[1:32:15] so we don't get to divide it just how we
[1:32:17] want to
[1:32:18] but according to the instructions that
[1:32:20] we've been given in the leadership of
[1:32:21] the Holy Ghost
[1:32:23] now watch
[1:32:25] are you still with me this morning got a
[1:32:28] few more minutes
[1:32:30] Joshua conquered the land
[1:32:32] and he gets to the end of it that's
[1:32:34] where we're at in Joshua 21 he said
[1:32:36] there's not a man that stood before us
[1:32:38] God kept his word
[1:32:40] we could all look back over our own
[1:32:41] lives and say God kept his word he kept
[1:32:44] me safe he kept me kept me whole kept my
[1:32:46] family God kept his word god did what he
[1:32:49] promised he would do and I want to
[1:32:50] testify today if you'll stay with the
[1:32:52] message of the hour God keeps his word
[1:32:55] and I told you I preached that when I
[1:32:57] was 16 years old here in this area and I
[1:32:59] preached that Pastor but really I
[1:33:00] pastored your your father and mother for
[1:33:02] a little while and I preached the same
[1:33:04] thing only I hope I understand more now
[1:33:06] than I did then but but God kept his
[1:33:08] word from then till now and he'll keep
[1:33:11] his word tomorrow
[1:33:13] and some of you Elders could stand up
[1:33:15] and say Amen to that because you've been
[1:33:18] through it but you know you're a seed of
[1:33:19] God God kept his word you came up like
[1:33:22] the seed it comes it'll find a crack
[1:33:24] somewhere to come up and reach for the
[1:33:26] sunlight God keeps his word
[1:33:29] hahaha
[1:33:31] but now there's something specific left
[1:33:34] to do
[1:33:36] Take Your Land
[1:33:39] right
[1:33:40] Take Your Land
[1:33:42] Joshua come in and and the walls of
[1:33:44] Jericho fell down at the shout
[1:33:47] all right
[1:33:49] but now there was some land each tribe
[1:33:51] had to take
[1:33:52] and Joshua said
[1:33:54] it's finished it's been the Lord is
[1:33:57] taking care of us it's at the end of his
[1:33:59] life but there were still areas
[1:34:01] that hadn't been taken but it belonged
[1:34:03] to them it had been revealed to them
[1:34:05] remember it was Caleb who went out and
[1:34:08] found the land found a specific place
[1:34:11] oh God the place of the Resurrection I
[1:34:14] don't have time to go into that this
[1:34:16] morning but Caleb found Hebron he found
[1:34:18] the place for the resurrection
[1:34:20] and he comes back out and he says he
[1:34:22] said I want that place
[1:34:25] and I'll tell you today I'm not
[1:34:27] satisfied I know this message restores
[1:34:29] us back even to Pentecost it restores us
[1:34:31] back to uh to gifts and to and to all
[1:34:35] these things and to have Services where
[1:34:36] we enjoy the presence of the Lord it
[1:34:38] restores us back to that but it even
[1:34:40] restores us further back because we're
[1:34:42] not content with just any old part of
[1:34:44] the land we're not content with what
[1:34:45] Wesley had or what Luther had or what
[1:34:47] the Pentecostals had we want the
[1:34:49] resurrection
[1:34:51] we want a rapture
[1:34:53] so Caleb goes out he finds that specific
[1:34:55] piece of land and he says
[1:34:57] I want that mountain
[1:35:00] nobody believed it
[1:35:02] but 40 years later he's still following
[1:35:04] Joshua around
[1:35:07] Moses is gone but Joshua's still there
[1:35:11] oh my
[1:35:13] watch brother Branham
[1:35:16] you can go read the whole thing again
[1:35:17] pick up your pen and write it from the
[1:35:19] church age book
[1:35:20] and brother Branham reads it
[1:35:23] what he had written under the
[1:35:25] inspiration of the Holy Spirit he wrote
[1:35:27] it and they wrote it in the church book
[1:35:29] he said he did not complete all his work
[1:35:31] while in his Earthly Ministry so now he
[1:35:34] works in and through
[1:35:35] the bride
[1:35:37] someone say that the bride
[1:35:39] who are you
[1:35:41] is there something left to do who's
[1:35:43] going to do it
[1:35:45] who's going to be his hands his feet now
[1:35:46] again there's nothing left as far as a
[1:35:49] worldwide sweeping Revival no more
[1:35:51] prophets to come we're at the end
[1:35:53] this is it
[1:35:55] the Lord the Lord has has settled down
[1:35:58] we settled down in our age the the uh
[1:36:01] the boat the ship has come in and the
[1:36:03] Sinker or the Sinker the uh the weight
[1:36:05] has gone down we are we are we are
[1:36:08] steady the anchor is down the boat is
[1:36:11] anchored but Danny we got an anchor
[1:36:13] that'll Hold Us unlike that one we had
[1:36:15] in the river
[1:36:16] we're anchored to both ends of the boat
[1:36:19] we're sitting there where there's good
[1:36:21] fishing right we're stable that's the
[1:36:24] hour we live in and yet again there's
[1:36:26] something specific for us to take what
[1:36:28] is that what is that sister genius our
[1:36:30] joy
[1:36:31] our peace
[1:36:33] our satisfaction
[1:36:35] our family
[1:36:37] our churches
[1:36:39] they belong to us
[1:36:43] they don't belong to this this world
[1:36:45] that's gone nuts
[1:36:48] they belong to us
[1:36:50] there's a specific work left for some
[1:36:53] for to do he said he did not complete
[1:36:54] all his work in his Earthly Ministry so
[1:36:56] now he works in and through the bride
[1:36:58] onto that next slide he did not complete
[1:37:00] it she knows that he said for it was not
[1:37:02] yet time for him to do certain things
[1:37:04] that he must now do but he will now
[1:37:07] fulfill through the bride that work
[1:37:09] which he left for this specific time
[1:37:13] and he goes on he said now let us stand
[1:37:16] like Joshua and Caleb
[1:37:19] our promised land is coming in sight
[1:37:22] even as theirs did
[1:37:25] he said now Joshua means Jehovah Savior
[1:37:27] and he represents the end time leader
[1:37:30] that will come to the church now we know
[1:37:31] that brother Branham came as that end
[1:37:33] time leader but we also know that the
[1:37:35] son of man Ministry was not just brother
[1:37:36] Branham it was the word itself that come
[1:37:39] in our day to be a leader to us brother
[1:37:41] Branham taught that he said he was a son
[1:37:43] of man revealing these son of man so the
[1:37:45] son of man Ministry is the word the
[1:37:47] brother said the son of man is the word
[1:37:48] he was not just the anointing but he was
[1:37:50] the word and so now that end time leader
[1:37:52] will come to the church even as Paul
[1:37:54] came as the original leader Caleb
[1:37:57] represents those that stayed true with
[1:37:59] Joshua
[1:38:01] oh God that's what I want to be
[1:38:04] again what did Caleb do Joshua 14 and 6
[1:38:07] says in the children of Judah came into
[1:38:09] Joshua and gilgal and Caleb the son of
[1:38:12] Jeff and of the kennestite said unto him
[1:38:13] thou knowest the thing that the Lord
[1:38:15] said unto Moses the man of God
[1:38:17] concerning me and thee in Kenneth bernia
[1:38:20] in other words we could look at it like
[1:38:22] this you know what you told me and pick
[1:38:24] up your pen and write
[1:38:26] I don't know about you but I take the
[1:38:28] the words of a prophet personally I
[1:38:30] wasn't alive when he came but I take it
[1:38:32] personally
[1:38:33] he spoke to me
[1:38:36] when he said there was a specific work
[1:38:38] left to do
[1:38:39] when he said if you if he has any hands
[1:38:41] through your hands if he has any feet to
[1:38:43] your feet when he said that all that
[1:38:45] Christ was he poured into the church
[1:38:47] that's me
[1:38:49] mama that's me and so he said you know
[1:38:52] the thing that the Lord said unto Moses
[1:38:54] concerning me
[1:38:56] know what he said
[1:38:58] oh my we need to remind ourselves of it
[1:39:00] today
[1:39:01] and then he goes on to verse 9 Moses
[1:39:03] swear on that day saying surely the land
[1:39:05] were on thy feet of trodden shall be
[1:39:07] thine inheritance and thy children's
[1:39:09] forever because thou Hast holy followed
[1:39:12] the Lord my God that was totally Paul
[1:39:14] let's do that today Church let's holy
[1:39:16] follow the lord our god let's give him
[1:39:18] all of our mind all of our strength all
[1:39:20] of our all that we have
[1:39:22] give it to him you may not understand
[1:39:24] what I'm talking about this morning but
[1:39:26] if you could just give him everything
[1:39:27] you do to understand everything you do
[1:39:29] have everything you do want everything
[1:39:31] you do everything that is yours today
[1:39:33] you take that and believe for that
[1:39:36] he'll reveal the rest to you
[1:39:39] amen
[1:39:40] he said yes that's the Holy Father the
[1:39:42] Lord my God
[1:39:44] in verse 10 he said now behold the Lord
[1:39:45] has kept me alive
[1:39:47] oh there's going to be some who are
[1:39:49] alive and remain at the coal mine he
[1:39:52] said those there will be those that were
[1:39:53] alive and remain as the coming of the
[1:39:55] Lord the Lord has kept me alive these 45
[1:39:57] years even since the Lord spake this
[1:40:00] word unto Moses while the children of
[1:40:02] Israel wandered in the wilderness and
[1:40:03] now lo I am this day four score and five
[1:40:06] years old 85. now not many of you are
[1:40:10] older than that maybe a few
[1:40:12] y'all been married 61 years you've got
[1:40:14] to be getting close to that but we won't
[1:40:16] we won't ask this morning
[1:40:19] it'd be 85 in March so brother Caleb
[1:40:22] you've been getting picked on a lot
[1:40:24] lately haven't you
[1:40:27] said I'm as strong this day as I was 40
[1:40:29] years ago
[1:40:31] I believe he's speaking by faith
[1:40:33] he said I'm just stay for scoring five
[1:40:35] years old
[1:40:36] he might have walked up there with a
[1:40:38] walker and a cane and everything else
[1:40:39] but he believed
[1:40:41] he was 85 years old in body but he had
[1:40:44] the same Spirit the same the same idea
[1:40:47] the same desire to take the land that he
[1:40:49] did when he was 45. amen
[1:40:52] he said I'm as strong this day as I was
[1:40:54] in the day that Moses sent me as my
[1:40:56] strength was then even so is my strength
[1:40:59] now this should be our testimony today
[1:41:01] maybe you're getting older and I know
[1:41:03] some of them that are watching this
[1:41:04] morning getting older it's hard to even
[1:41:05] come to church hard to get you out of
[1:41:07] your chair nearly but remember you're as
[1:41:10] strong this day as you were the day you
[1:41:11] heard the message why because you have
[1:41:13] strength inside of you it's going to
[1:41:15] make a Rapture one of these days
[1:41:17] whether you go by way of the Grave
[1:41:19] you'll come up first in the resurrection
[1:41:21] if you are here on the day of the
[1:41:22] Rapture you'll be you'll be alive and
[1:41:24] remain and in a moment in a twinkling of
[1:41:27] an eye we shall be changed the Bible
[1:41:29] says
[1:41:30] amen do you believe it this morning
[1:41:32] that's what Caleb stands for he says I
[1:41:35] want all the land
[1:41:37] amen I'm a strong this day as I was the
[1:41:40] day that Moses sent me as my strength
[1:41:43] was then even so is my strength now I
[1:41:45] want to testify you to you today he kept
[1:41:47] his word
[1:41:48] even if it's my streets now for war both
[1:41:51] to go out and to come in and verse 12 he
[1:41:53] said now therefore give me this mountain
[1:41:57] give me this mountain wherever the Lord
[1:41:59] speaking that day I read in the message
[1:42:01] and my family could be at peace give me
[1:42:03] this mountain I read in the message
[1:42:05] where a prophet told me that I could
[1:42:07] have joy give me this mountain I read
[1:42:10] where he talked about Divine Healing I
[1:42:11] read in the scripture he said I'm the
[1:42:13] Lord thy God that heals all thy diseases
[1:42:15] give me this mountain
[1:42:18] are you with me this morning
[1:42:21] whatever you're facing give me this
[1:42:24] mountain
[1:42:25] Hallelujah word of the Lord spake in
[1:42:28] that day for thou heard just in that day
[1:42:30] how the anakams were there and the
[1:42:32] cities were great in Vince Caleb
[1:42:34] volunteered to take the worst one the
[1:42:36] Bible says The Last Enemy that'll be
[1:42:37] destroyed is death
[1:42:39] it was that was the hardest one but
[1:42:41] don't you know it's already been
[1:42:43] destroyed
[1:42:45] amen so Pokey crowd say death where is
[1:42:48] your sting grave reason the be of death
[1:42:52] stung Christ on the cross he pulled his
[1:42:53] stinger out
[1:42:55] hey man
[1:42:57] that's the last Mountain
[1:42:58] [Laughter]
[1:43:04] oh God you gotta have faith during these
[1:43:06] times
[1:43:07] that's what brother JT the other day I
[1:43:09] hope you don't mind me telling this
[1:43:10] sure they're watching her we'll watch it
[1:43:13] JT the other day they were going to have
[1:43:15] to do a procedure on him he was worried
[1:43:17] because it's one where they had to stop
[1:43:18] it would have to stop his heart
[1:43:20] I said brother he said well I'm a winner
[1:43:21] either way
[1:43:23] but then he kind of got down a little
[1:43:25] bit because no one wants to leave
[1:43:28] huh who wants to leave I said well we'll
[1:43:30] pray that they don't have to do it
[1:43:33] we'll pray that they don't have to do it
[1:43:34] and the next morning he called me I was
[1:43:36] coming back up to see him he said he
[1:43:37] said they said they're not having to do
[1:43:39] the procedure I'm going home
[1:43:41] so we thank God for that
[1:43:43] [Applause]
[1:43:44] I watched that and
[1:43:46] I watched that and I
[1:43:48] I watch his face as he was there and I
[1:43:50] thought Lord
[1:43:52] I know when I come down to that hour and
[1:43:55] none of us have any guarantee brother JT
[1:43:57] may live longer than I do
[1:43:59] that's just the truth of it no one has a
[1:44:01] guarantee
[1:44:03] the people that we love it if they live
[1:44:05] long enough eventually they all die
[1:44:07] that's the one thing we all know is that
[1:44:09] we all die
[1:44:10] I remember the story about a man that a
[1:44:12] woman that was there at 9 11 and the
[1:44:15] plane hit beneath her and she was one of
[1:44:16] the upper stories and at some point she
[1:44:17] realized she wasn't going to make it she
[1:44:19] was on a 9-1-1 call never forget it she
[1:44:21] said I'm going to die aren't I
[1:44:23] and I thought about that and I thought
[1:44:25] every one of us could say that
[1:44:27] none of us know
[1:44:29] none of us though heard another story
[1:44:31] about a woman that got dropped out of a
[1:44:32] plane she dropped out of a plane for ten
[1:44:34] thousand feet strapped to her seat and
[1:44:36] survived
[1:44:38] we can't go until it's time
[1:44:42] we can't go till let's hope we hear it
[1:44:44] today but when the time comes let's be
[1:44:47] like Caleb I'm a strong today I may be
[1:44:50] weak in my body but I'm as strong today
[1:44:52] in my faith as I was the very day
[1:44:55] that I heard this message
[1:44:57] let this encourage you today this
[1:44:58] message is still the same my body may
[1:45:00] not be the same but this message is
[1:45:02] still the same I may not have as much
[1:45:04] voice as I did as a 16 year old preacher
[1:45:06] but this message has not changed brother
[1:45:08] Bill this message I've changed but the
[1:45:11] message hasn't changed you've changed
[1:45:12] but the message is still the same it's
[1:45:14] still the same for going out the same
[1:45:16] for coming in amen it's still the
[1:45:18] opening of the word to us and we're here
[1:45:20] for a reason we're not here to sit down
[1:45:23] sit by ourselves and segregate into our
[1:45:25] own homes and not fellowship with
[1:45:27] anybody we're here to fight a war
[1:45:29] you don't fight words by yourself
[1:45:30] [Music]
[1:45:32] you fight with your brothers and sisters
[1:45:36] you stand together
[1:45:40] he said now therefore give me this
[1:45:41] mountain if that mountain facing you is
[1:45:42] death
[1:45:43] give me that mountain doctor gives you a
[1:45:46] report says it can't be it can't be any
[1:45:48] good you're going to die give me this
[1:45:50] mountain
[1:45:51] I believe your report Lord
[1:45:54] over the door what the doctor says give
[1:45:57] me the mountain the Lord spake of in
[1:45:58] that day I love that so you can't be
[1:46:00] sure of taking any mountain he didn't
[1:46:02] speak about
[1:46:04] are you hearing me
[1:46:06] you can't be sure taken but I'm so glad
[1:46:08] the message covers it all
[1:46:10] the Bible covers it all it's all here
[1:46:12] everything you need to live
[1:46:15] some false Doctrine or something you
[1:46:17] can't be sure of that
[1:46:19] he said the cities were great and fences
[1:46:20] so be the Lord will be with me I shall
[1:46:22] be able to drive them out as the Lord
[1:46:24] said
[1:46:25] laughs
[1:46:27] musicians go ahead and come Joshua
[1:46:30] coming into the land opened up the
[1:46:32] possibility of the sun standing still I
[1:46:34] may know that this morning no this is
[1:46:36] important don't get distracted
[1:46:39] the sun is standing still they didn't
[1:46:41] need it
[1:46:42] in in the wilderness
[1:46:44] not not didn't even need it in Egypt but
[1:46:46] there come a time in the land
[1:46:48] that they needed the sun to stand still
[1:46:51] and Joshua stood there and said Son
[1:46:53] stand still
[1:46:55] and it did it obeyed the voice of a man
[1:46:57] and the Bible says there was never a day
[1:46:59] like that day
[1:47:00] when when the sun obeyed the voice of a
[1:47:03] man
[1:47:04] but we're living in that day
[1:47:06] one of the things that the opening of
[1:47:08] the seals opening of the word opened up
[1:47:10] to us was Mark 11 23.
[1:47:14] you know what that is brother said I
[1:47:16] never understood it he said I wouldn't
[1:47:17] preach on it because I didn't understand
[1:47:18] it
[1:47:19] he said but then the lord gave him the
[1:47:21] experience with the squirrels
[1:47:23] and gave him the experience with Hattie

[1:47:28] the different things that happened the
