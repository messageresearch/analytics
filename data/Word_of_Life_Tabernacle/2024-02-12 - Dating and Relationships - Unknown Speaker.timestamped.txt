[33:36] be she that thou Hast appointed for thy
[33:39] servant Isaac thereby shall I know that
[33:42] thou has showed kindness unto my master
[33:45] verse 15 it came to pass before he had
[33:47] done speaking you believe God answers
[33:49] prayer before he had done speaking that
[33:52] behold Rebecca came out who was born to
[33:55] bethu son of milka the wife of n or
[33:57] Abraham's brother with her picture upon
[34:01] her shoulder for the Lord would that his
[34:02] Blessing the reading of the word you may
[34:03] be
[34:05] seated over the years our customs and
[34:09] traditions regarding courtship and
[34:10] dating and marriage have
[34:13] changed and uh you're going to find all
[34:15] kinds of different Customs from all
[34:17] kinds of different places I read about a
[34:19] few that in India uh they prohibit a
[34:23] younger brother from marrying before an
[34:25] elder brother so why they wouldn't let
[34:27] you get married before Jason so what
[34:30] they do though if you can't find a bride
[34:32] for the older brother you let the young
[34:34] uh the older brother marry a
[34:37] tree their
[34:39] custom that makes the younger brother
[34:41] free to take a
[34:43] wife the Anglo-Saxons back in the old
[34:46] days they uh in their weddings they
[34:48] that's the Anglo-Saxons were the English
[34:50] people back in the day and and uh what
[34:52] they would do is instead of exchanging
[34:54] Rings they actually passed shoes so the
[34:58] the bride would give her shoes to her to
[35:00] the groom and he took it and hit her on
[35:02] the head with
[35:04] it so that's a strange
[35:08] custom I heard of a Boston sea captain
[35:11] had been gone for three years at Sea and
[35:12] he come back in and and kissed his wife
[35:15] in public on a Sunday and ended up spent
[35:17] two hours in the stalks for that offence
[35:20] that's not the case today is it a uh
[35:24] there's an old Kentucky law it states
[35:25] that a wife can't move Furniture in the
[35:27] house without her husband's permission
[35:29] well I wish that was still the
[35:34] law but a man has restrictions too in
[35:37] Kentucky they say he can't legally marry
[35:39] his wife's grandmother so he's
[35:42] restricted as well just trying to loosen
[35:44] you up a little bit before we get into
[35:46] this in Maryland there's a city
[35:48] ordinance that says that a kiss can't
[35:50] last any longer than one
[35:52] second you know what they do in Siberia
[35:54] when they want to show interest in
[35:56] somebody you know how you do that now I
[35:57] think you younger kids uh Chase each
[36:00] other literally that's not good
[36:03] but when you're going to show interest
[36:05] in somebody in Siberia what they do is
[36:08] they take lice come like in your hair
[36:11] they gather lice and they throw it at
[36:13] them so that shows them they're
[36:17] interested so we won't be doing
[36:20] that in ancient Rome the custom was to
[36:23] break the wedding cake over the head of
[36:25] the bride and you could not be in
[36:27] government office unless that had been
[36:29] done at your wedding
[36:31] law so you know in the message we have
[36:34] our own
[36:36] Customs we do we come up with all kinds
[36:39] of things and and uh uh you know many of
[36:42] them are good and and and I want to say
[36:45] beginning in the beginning that I I I'm
[36:47] I will always uh I will always defer to
[36:51] parents when it comes to their children
[36:53] and what age they allow them to date or
[36:55] or not to date I know we don't call it
[36:58] that but courtship whatever that it is
[37:01] and uh I will say that what age you
[37:04] allow that to happen and things like
[37:05] that that's up to you and you can have
[37:08] certain customs in your home and you
[37:09] should but Customs can change but the
[37:12] word of God abides forever amen and and
[37:15] we look in the scriptures and and begin
[37:18] to see that the Bible doesn't really
[37:19] talk about dating as we would call it
[37:20] today or courting courtship it does give
[37:23] us a few examples of people who got
[37:24] married rebeccca and as but you know not
[37:27] many of us are going to be able to do
[37:29] exactly like uh exactly like was done
[37:32] with Isaac and Rebecca I I would not
[37:34] have trusted my dad to send somebody to
[37:37] find me a wife I'm just come being out
[37:40] there with you uh tonight but maybe some
[37:42] of you would that would be good brother
[37:44] Peter if you just let me do that we'll
[37:47] we'll do it that
[37:48] way uh and then uh uh Esther you have
[37:52] the story of Esther of course she
[37:53] married a a king uh that was not not a
[37:57] what we call a Christian but God did
[38:00] that for such a time as that you know it
[38:02] was for a purpose a reason and then Ruth
[38:05] you find the story of Ruth and and and
[38:07] the way that things were done there of
[38:09] course she had to be redeemed a great
[38:10] type of the Bride uh and I know some of
[38:13] you thinking well maybe the Song of
[38:14] Solomon but let me let me just say this
[38:16] up front The Song of Solomon is for
[38:18] married
[38:19] people so if you if you start using that
[38:23] you know when it comes to when you're
[38:25] just going with somebody or you begin to
[38:27] like somebody you start referring to the
[38:28] Song of Solomon don't do that put that
[38:30] off till you get married there's a lot
[38:32] in there and um anyway that's uh
[38:35] something that you don't want to do now
[38:37] uh so you look at the scriptures and but
[38:39] there's guidelines that are there how we
[38:41] should act and what's appropriate and
[38:43] what we should do I think what's more
[38:45] important than than how is
[38:49] who right and and I find in the message
[38:52] brother Brandon spends a lot more time
[38:54] talking about who we marry not not how
[38:57] we get to that point and it's so it's
[39:00] much more important so I will say this
[39:03] dating or courtship even the way we do
[39:06] it is a modern invention it's not the
[39:07] way it was done in the scripture uh it
[39:10] was more of an arranged thing or it's
[39:12] done very very differently than what the
[39:14] way we do it today yet I believe God
[39:17] works in Us in in the way we do things
[39:19] and I believe God allows that and and
[39:22] works in that and I'm so glad God led me
[39:24] to my wife and led my you married people
[39:26] you say praise God you know that that
[39:29] God puts you together and there there
[39:30] was not another person on the earth that
[39:32] could have put up with Jo way but Joanna
[39:34] way but God put you together and uh and
[39:37] so you and you look back and think well
[39:39] there are others that could have this
[39:40] could have happened or that could have
[39:41] happened but God puts you together and
[39:44] and so it it's so important that he did
[39:46] that and we thank God for that so we we
[39:48] say there's somebody brother Cale put it
[39:51] so eloquently earlier he said there's a
[39:53] I think he said there's a lid for every
[39:55] poch you know and there there's just a
[39:58] there's a place for you some somewhere
[39:59] where you fit there's a there's a
[40:01] husband for you a wife for you but you
[40:03] need to wait on the Lord and and let the
[40:05] Lord take charge of your life you just
[40:07] fall in love with Jesus as much as you
[40:09] can and and God will make sure the right
[40:12] one shows
[40:13] up so but we had a did have a prophit
[40:18] and day gives us some guidelines as well
[40:20] especially on the relationships which is
[40:21] what I want to dwell on more today
[40:23] between unmarried young men and women
[40:26] and and here in the church and uh some
[40:29] guidelines for scriptural relationships
[40:30] number one I'll say this when you begin
[40:32] to like somebody you need to respect the
[40:35] family
[40:36] Rules you need to respect her dad he's
[40:39] invested a lot of time a lot of effort
[40:42] in that gr it's pride and joy it's the
[40:44] apple of his eye respect the dad that's
[40:47] so important and the mom as well respect
[40:50] that couple and their family Rules and
[40:53] uh and I will say this there needs to be
[40:55] rules yes and I want talk to parents for
[40:58] a minute because the Bible tells us to
[41:00] train up a child in the way he should go
[41:01] when he's old he won't depart from it
[41:03] the training part is ours to do nobody
[41:06] else is going to do it we were given
[41:08] children for that purpose we're the ones
[41:10] that set the rules so a lot of trouble
[41:13] in teenage years or later years could be
[41:15] avoided if we had corrected our children
[41:17] when they were young someone said amen
[41:20] so we we don't the Bible tells us don't
[41:22] withhold correction from the child that
[41:24] if you beat him with the rod he shall
[41:26] not die cover your ears kids you know
[41:30] that's what the Bible says if you beat
[41:32] him with they're literally doing
[41:36] that thank you you can uncover them now
[41:40] for if thou beatest him with the rod he
[41:42] shall not die now
[41:44] look a young man or woman should
[41:47] completely obey the rules parents set
[41:51] but the parents got to set the rules and
[41:53] you need to teach your children to do
[41:55] that I will say this if you can't obey a
[41:57] parent's rule stay away oh you you need
[42:00] to obey the rules especially in a child
[42:02] a girl or boy that's underage you guys
[42:05] need to abide by the rules and but it's
[42:07] a parent's responsibility to set those
[42:09] rules and provide consequences if
[42:10] they're broken so brother brandom says
[42:13] this he said to face up to
[42:14] responsibility sometimes it takes the
[42:16] hide off of us to do that as a father to
[42:18] face up responsibility give your child a
[42:20] whiping little fellas you don't want to
[42:22] do that but as a father or mother you've
[42:24] got to face the responsibility of
[42:26] raising that child cu the Bible said
[42:28] spare the rod you'll spoil your son he
[42:30] said that still stands good in the sight
[42:32] of every psychologist there is in the
[42:33] world he said that Still Remains God's
[42:35] truth it's still the truth no matter
[42:37] what message mama
[42:39] says and some you know what I'm talking
[42:42] about if there had been more of that
[42:44] practice he said we wouldn't have had so
[42:45] much juvenile delinquency and stuff and
[42:47] the rot we got in the world today amen
[42:51] brand talked about the ignorance of
[42:52] Kentucky and about those people that he
[42:54] said what does this have to do with
[42:55] dating we have have a lot less trouble
[42:57] with dating if we take care of the kids
[42:59] now begin to establish boundaries in
[43:01] their
[43:03] lives um he said sometimes they talk
[43:06] about ignorance in Kentucky he said let
[43:07] one of their daughters come in the
[43:08] morning with her hair all twisted up
[43:10] manicure over her face he said makeup on
[43:13] her face all night long some little
[43:14] Ricky with a flat top haircut he said I
[43:16] tell you she'll she'll know the next
[43:18] time she goes out a barrel slat or limb
[43:19] off a hickory that just skin her down I
[43:21] said I tell you you're talking about
[43:23] juvenile delinquency so many papers
[43:25] talking about I think it's parent
[43:26] delinquency said if you were to have the
[43:28] old Golden Rule hanging a wall with them
[43:30] Ten Commandments hanging on it take a
[43:32] young out there and Shu him down a
[43:33] little bit you wouldn't have so much and
[43:34] saying poor little Ricky you're nice he
[43:36] didn't mean to do bad Martha he said she
[43:38] needs a good beating is what she
[43:40] needs that's a prophet said that not me
[43:44] Bible say spare the rod you spoil your
[43:45] child that's exactly right you'll never
[43:47] find anything any
[43:48] better now I'll say
[43:51] this how many of you didn't understand
[43:54] the rules maybe I won't take a show
[43:56] hands I did not understand all the rules
[44:00] that we had and they didn't make any
[44:02] sense they changed from person to person
[44:05] child to child I got some agreement back
[44:08] there it's like we just did not
[44:10] understand what the rules were and I
[44:12] think it's respons we're responsible as
[44:14] parents to make sure the rules are few
[44:17] and
[44:18] clear right because we don't want to
[44:20] overburden our children and make them
[44:22] feel like they're in a
[44:23] jail and it's not what we want to but we
[44:26] want them to have freedom we want them
[44:28] to know that we trust them and yet we
[44:30] recognize they're kids and they could
[44:32] get in trouble so don't make rules that
[44:35] make no sense or that change from person
[44:39] to person or day to day or unfair
[44:42] arbitrary impossible to carry out or
[44:45] that you wouldn't do
[44:47] yourself right we don't want to be
[44:50] Pharisees to our children our children
[44:51] know us don't they right they know who
[44:53] we are and what we are how we live so we
[44:56] don't want to be a
[44:57] Pharisee brother the Bible says that the
[44:59] Pharisees I think this is going out on
[45:01] me the Bible said the Pharisees bind
[45:03] heavy burdens and Grievous to be born
[45:05] and lay them on men's shoulders but they
[45:06] won't touch won't move one of them with
[45:08] their fingers we don't want to be like
[45:09] that so you have to know then and I want
[45:12] to on the other side of this discipline
[45:14] thing you got to set rules but you got
[45:16] to know when to commit your children to
[45:18] God and I know adult you know adult
[45:21] children their parents have never
[45:22] figured out that they need to commit
[45:23] their children to God and leave them
[45:25] alone
[45:27] let them be adults let them be a married
[45:30] couple don't intervene in their private
[45:32] life don't need to do that wrong so you
[45:36] have to know when to commit them to God
[45:38] uh brother talked about Rebecca now at
[45:41] this time she was 18 years old so she's
[45:43] older but he said she was 18 years old
[45:46] he he talked about how that she went out
[45:47] and played that music Boogie wogie music
[45:49] he called it and and all of those things
[45:51] and you talking about how it just killed
[45:53] him you know and she went sass her
[45:55] mother and almost knocked the things off
[45:56] the wall went to school he said no I
[45:58] ought to have seemingly just taken my
[46:00] belt off and followed her out in the
[46:02] yard brought her back with a few warps
[46:04] around her he said but I thought wait a
[46:06] minute I got to think 18-year-old
[46:08] thoughts you were a kid once too right I
[46:12] was a kid once so I said mother I know
[46:16] she started crying me just said I know
[46:17] you've done all you can do I've done all
[46:19] I can do now it's out of our hands we
[46:22] have to take the next step they talked
[46:24] for a while and I said to take your
[46:26] hands off she said that's my kid I said
[46:29] isn't it mine too all right if she was
[46:31] dying this morning you'd have to commit
[46:33] her to God for her Eternal destination
[46:35] why can't we commit her to God now for
[46:36] her Earthly
[46:37] Journey if she was laying there on her
[46:39] deathbed you'd have to commit her to God
[46:42] right you'd have to trust that
[46:43] whatever's been done is enough that
[46:45] you've exposed her to the to the
[46:47] presence of God and put them in church
[46:49] all that you could and that would be
[46:50] enough so if that was the case now
[46:52] they've gotten older they're going to
[46:53] leave home they're going to do if
[46:54] they're 18 they could just
[46:57] leave right so we don't we don't want to
[46:59] kick them out the door we want to keep
[47:01] them under Godly Fellowship as long as
[47:03] we can and I appreciate some of you
[47:04] doing that you parents may maybe your
[47:06] kids don't understand everything but
[47:08] they're and maybe they're adults now but
[47:09] let them be comfortable coming back to
[47:11] home and coming back to the house of God
[47:13] sir we don't want to kick them out and
[47:15] yet there has to be rules so he said he
[47:18] said you can take her he said well
[47:20] that's you're my kid he said it's mine
[47:22] too he said me not say nothing to her I
[47:24] said I never said that we'll quit
[47:26] scolding her and just advise her so your
[47:30] role changes as a parent she needs a
[47:32] buddy and you're the one to be her buddy
[47:34] you and I were her parents he said these
[47:36] kids today needs a buddy if they had a
[47:37] mother and father would stay home and
[47:39] take care of them instead of out here in
[47:41] a barroom running around all night and
[47:42] things like that wouldn't have juvenile
[47:44] delinquency do we believe that he said
[47:47] if they if they'd spank them when
[47:48] they're little we wouldn't have Junior
[47:49] juvenile delinquency and if they'd stay
[47:51] home and be a buddy to them when they
[47:52] get older we wouldn't have juvenile
[47:55] delinquency
[47:57] okay so moving on what does the message
[48:00] tell us about dating and relationships
[48:01] now
[48:03] look uh brother they asked brother BR
[48:05] what activities should our pre-teen
[48:06] children participate in now these kids
[48:09] up here on the front I think are
[48:10] pre-teens we could call them that but
[48:12] they're not teenagers yet but they want
[48:13] to be that's what a pre-teen is they
[48:15] want to be
[48:17] teenager so it says what activi should
[48:20] we allow them to participate in also how
[48:22] should we go about helping them select
[48:23] their Associates keep them in Christian
[48:26] company as long as you possibly
[48:30] can that's our job
[48:33] parents he said if it's a girl keep her
[48:36] with Christian girls Christian boys vice
[48:38] versa if she's old enough to go with a
[48:40] boy and he said see that she keeps with
[48:43] the right kind of a boy discourage her
[48:45] to any boy otherwise or boy to a girl if
[48:49] she's going with an unbeliever try to
[48:50] encourage her to go with a Believer and
[48:52] vice versa make your home nice
[48:56] make your home nice make your home a
[48:59] place where your daughter or son will
[49:01] not be ashamed to bring their company
[49:03] before their father and mother into
[49:04] their house right so sometimes you got
[49:06] to make allowances for your children
[49:08] make your home nice well I could live
[49:09] anywhere and I could live out in the
[49:11] woods and with all the junk piled up you
[49:13] might be able to but your kids might be
[49:15] ashamed to bring their company that's
[49:16] right right so make your home nice and
[49:19] make home so happy they'll be pleased in
[49:22] their home to stay there so Mom and Dad
[49:23] aren't fussing all the time right make
[49:26] get someplace where the they feel like
[49:28] their friends are welcome cuz they're
[49:30] safer at your house than somewhere
[49:33] else and and we need to make sure that
[49:35] we don't make so many rules I said that
[49:37] home feels like a jail that's right and
[49:39] their bedroom is the cell that we put
[49:41] them in every night right it's their
[49:43] home too you need to we need to
[49:45] recognize that the Bible tells us again
[49:49] talking to parents it talks to us dad
[49:51] says fathers provoke not your children
[49:53] to anger here's a reason L they be
[49:57] discouraged CU you could discourage your
[49:59] children and I I pray that I haven't
[50:01] done that you know I've I've thought a
[50:03] lot about that there's a couple of
[50:04] things uh that I would do differently
[50:06] and I'm just being open and honest with
[50:08] you tonight there's a couple of things I
[50:10] would do differently uh with my kids and
[50:12] as they've gotten older uh the one thing
[50:15] I would be more encouraging especially
[50:17] to to Peter I'd be more encouraging to
[50:19] to my son I just being honest with you
[50:22] than what I have been and and I've tried
[50:24] to just make him the line and do all
[50:26] those things but I'd be more encouraging
[50:27] if I could do raise him to 16 again he's
[50:30] a fine young man I'd be more encouraging
[50:32] to him if I could and I so I say
[50:34] encourage your kids tell them you love
[50:36] them because it's easy for them to get
[50:38] discouraged that's right and uh the
[50:41] other thing is I wouldn't have given
[50:42] them phones till they were
[50:44] 18 that's not a law or gospel that's
[50:47] just what I would have done Ephesians
[50:50] 6:4 said you father speaking to us dads
[50:52] again provoke not your children to wrath
[50:55] don't pick on them but bring them up in
[50:57] the nurture and admonition of the Lord
[50:59] that's the two legs that they have to
[51:00] stand on nurture on one side teaching
[51:03] and admonition correction on the other
[51:05] that I have both don't treat your kids
[51:08] worse than your business
[51:11] associates right your kids shouldn't be
[51:13] shouldn't feel like they've treated
[51:15] worse than people that just random
[51:16] person that comes to the house now talk
[51:19] to as kids again now you getting older
[51:22] some of you guys trip and and Peter and
[51:24] Esther and land
[51:25] and uh Emma I don't want to forget Emma
[51:28] whatever Emma is there's Emma back here
[51:30] I don't mean to call you out but we got
[51:32] a little group and they're all going to
[51:33] camp this year and I'm so happy about
[51:35] that all them kids going to camp and
[51:37] Riley's a little bit older he's kind of
[51:39] kind of stepped up a little bit in that
[51:41] group but but there's a little group of
[51:43] you guys and I'm so happy that you got
[51:45] each other because when we came here my
[51:46] kids didn't have it seemed like anybody
[51:48] and and now you've gotten older and more
[51:51] folks have come and I appreciate that
[51:53] and and you're a little group but you
[51:54] need to know how to treat treat one
[51:55] another you treat your friends
[51:58] honorably if if it's a girl or a boy and
[52:01] opposite sex you need to treat them as
[52:03] they could be someone else's future
[52:05] spouse treat them like you would want
[52:07] someone to treat your future spouse you
[52:10] remember that don't don't get too
[52:13] friendly or too handsy because you need
[52:15] to you need to recognize that uh someday
[52:18] you're you're going to get older and
[52:20] you're going to get married to somebody
[52:21] and it may not be that person treat them
[52:23] right so that when you 20 years when you
[52:26] sit down across a table from them and
[52:28] you see them at Walmart you don't have
[52:29] to run and hide and I'm thankful for
[52:32] that I did have enough teaching in my
[52:33] life that when I went out as a young man
[52:36] I was a preacher and I went out and
[52:37] started liking girls and stuff I never
[52:39] dated anyone but my wife but I I like
[52:42] different ones and stuff and and I think
[52:44] I can honestly say that I acted in a way
[52:46] with them that I I don't have to be uh
[52:48] upset or I don't have to be embarrassed
[52:51] to be around them today I think that's
[52:53] the way it ought to be we ought to keep
[52:55] everything above board
[52:57] now uh when you're you know you're too
[53:00] young you're just too young and that's
[53:01] up to parents as far as ages it's just
[53:04] you can't get married when you're 12
[53:05] that's just not going to
[53:08] happen and uh and I'll say this you you
[53:12] you never don't ever be alone with and
[53:16] it should shouldn't have to be said but
[53:17] it does never be alone with a person of
[53:20] the opposite sex in a private
[53:22] setting that's not your brother sister
[53:25] mom and Dad right that's just you say
[53:28] well that's too strict that's too strict
[53:31] it every time if you don't set that rule
[53:35] almost every time people get messed up
[53:38] and it's not because you intend to do
[53:40] anything bad or you would even do
[53:41] anything bad this goes for older people
[53:45] too and in my office if I'm going to
[53:47] counsel with you I'm not going to
[53:49] counsel with a husband alone I mean a
[53:51] wife alone without her husband or
[53:54] without my wife being present right
[53:56] that's what we have to do or if I can't
[53:58] if for some reason my wife can't be
[54:00] there I call a deacon I need somebody to
[54:02] be there because it's just not
[54:04] appropriate and most of you know that
[54:06] and some of you don't know you're new
[54:08] but most of you know that I want you to
[54:09] be able to contact me if you're sick or
[54:11] it's an emergency or something like that
[54:13] most of the time we're just having a
[54:14] conversation I'll have a lady in the
[54:16] church that'll they'll tag my wife in
[54:18] the conversation and I'll say this if
[54:20] you ever send me a text she gets
[54:22] it because and and I do that because
[54:26] because I want to I want to be honorable
[54:28] before God and I have to answer for God
[54:30] for the things that I do so it's not
[54:32] just you kids I don't want you to think
[54:33] we're picking on you right because it's
[54:36] it's us too I have to make sure that I
[54:38] hold myself honorably because I could
[54:40] fail too just like anybody else the
[54:43] flesh is still flesh it always will be
[54:46] we need to remember that so brother
[54:48] brandom talked about that he said many
[54:49] times I go to houses and there are women
[54:51] standing out there he said I go to the
[54:53] house knock on the door a sister would
[54:54] come to the door door say come in
[54:56] brother brandom if her husband's not
[54:58] there unless it's a a case of sickness
[55:02] and somebody with me he said I don't go
[55:04] he said and then they call me to a
[55:05] hospital or to a room and say brother
[55:07] brandom come over here I'm sister so and
[55:09] so from so and so here at the hotel I
[55:11] brought my mother along so two women he
[55:13] said she's sick I take my wife if I
[55:15] don't I take some other brother right so
[55:17] he wouldn't even go into a room with two
[55:19] women present by himself he said I think
[55:23] it would be all right for me to go in
[55:24] there but what do some seen me go in
[55:26] there what if somebody seen me do it he
[55:28] said then the first thing you know they
[55:29] would say he went in there where that
[55:30] woman was he's chasing after women see
[55:32] that that would be a thing I shouldn't
[55:34] do see you should never do anything like
[55:36] that he said because you put a stumbling
[55:37] block in somebody else's way he said see
[55:39] I don't believe that I would do anything
[55:41] wrong in there he said I I would and
[55:42] trust God to go in there no matter what
[55:44] the thing was I would trust God he said
[55:46] but yet see I love the Lord well enough
[55:48] till I wouldn't do it that's what it
[55:49] comes down to young people you need to
[55:51] hold yourself accountable because you
[55:53] love God and you don't want to you don't
[55:54] want to bring any kind of a bad
[55:57] accusation against yourself as a
[55:59] Christian or against the church and so
[56:00] you just don't and so that's why we
[56:03] sometimes have chaperon and and people
[56:05] with with kids with uh young teenagers
[56:07] that are dating or going out or courting
[56:09] or whatever you want to call it uh you
[56:11] know when they're going out and we have
[56:13] chaperon for that now I don't say a
[56:15] chaperon is a law right I don't say
[56:18] that's a law that's up to you as a
[56:20] parent but I say it's not good for you
[56:23] to be alone in a private setting
[56:25] you need to have somebody there that can
[56:28] verify especially in this day and age
[56:31] when anybody can say anything about
[56:32] anybody that's right you need to protect
[56:34] yourself and I worry about that with my
[56:36] son I I worry about that with my
[56:38] daughter I I do not want them to get
[56:40] because all it would take is one false
[56:42] accusation ruin their
[56:44] life right and so we want to make sure
[56:46] we do things right as a church and so
[56:49] you do that that's protection for you
[56:51] that's not hard that's protection and so
[56:54] we want to be around people I say be in
[56:56] groups as much as you can be and there
[56:58] will come a time you you have to talk
[56:59] alone but but that'll be down the road
[57:02] but the brandom said see it's a love you
[57:04] have you'll not do it because it's a
[57:05] duty to do it you do it because you love
[57:06] the Lord you don't have to do it but you
[57:08] do it anyhow this is cutting out I'm
[57:10] going to
[57:12] switch but you do it anyway now Paul
[57:15] says this he said are you still with me
[57:17] tonight are we okay he said all things
[57:20] are lawful unto me but all things are
[57:23] not expedient
[57:25] so in other words there's things that I
[57:26] could do and get by with it but it's
[57:28] it's it's just not expedient it's going
[57:30] to make trouble down the road he said
[57:32] all things are lawful for me but I will
[57:34] not be brought under the power of any
[57:35] again 1 Corinthians 10:23 all things are
[57:38] lawful for me but all things are not
[57:39] expedient all things are lawful for me
[57:42] all things edify not so I need to do the
[57:44] things that edify and and make sure that
[57:46] we stay in that way now I I'll say this
[57:50] slow
[57:51] down slow down and marry the right one
[57:56] I'm aren't again aren't you glad you
[57:57] married the right one you married people
[58:00] slow down and marry the right one you
[58:03] you young kids you don't need to chase
[58:04] boys or chase girls no you're not
[58:07] chasing girls are you Jason no okay just
[58:11] checking you don't need to chase boys
[58:13] you don't need to chase girls you don't
[58:14] need to be jealous of somebody else you
[58:16] know somebody else in the church Allan
[58:18] told me to tell you all this you know
[58:22] so y'all y'all y'all just need to be
[58:25] careful you know uh God will lead you to
[58:27] the right one it'll come probably won't
[58:30] be anybody you know today so just
[58:32] throwing that out there I met my wife
[58:34] because darl Ward preached a service I
[58:36] think I've told you that before up here
[58:38] in Alton Missouri and I went to church
[58:40] so it's a good thing to go to church go
[58:43] to church as often as you can I went to
[58:45] church and met my wife and and I'm so
[58:47] glad that I did but slow down marry the
[58:50] right one God will lead you to the right
[58:52] one don't be influenced by Hollywood
[58:54] don't let a preacher arrange your
[58:56] marriage you got to know that it's right
[59:00] the pastor's not going to know for you I
[59:01] can give you advice but most of the time
[59:03] I don't know I'll just be honest with
[59:05] you I'm always surprised when it works
[59:09] out right so most of the time I don't
[59:11] know but I'm glad I'm happy to give you
[59:13] advice but God will lead you to the
[59:15] right one don't don't let a preacher
[59:16] arrange your marriage you've got a
[59:18] responsibility yourself to find the mind
[59:19] of the Lord and I'll say to those of you
[59:22] just in you know you're just friends and
[59:24] you want to call call yourself a
[59:25] boyfriend or girlfriend jealousy has no
[59:27] place in a friendly relationship just
[59:29] don't let that even even come around or
[59:32] get in your mind today we have virtual
[59:34] relationships and some of you older
[59:36] people don't even know what that is but
[59:37] that's a thing now you know they say
[59:39] you're not you're not really a couple
[59:42] until you uh put it on
[59:44] Facebook and I'll say that doesn't mean
[59:47] anything amen right when you change your
[59:49] relationship status on Facebook it means
[59:53] nothing it has has no level of
[59:55] commitment to it but people watch for
[59:57] that and and I'll say this before you
[1:00:01] enter a virtual relationship with
[1:00:02] someone in other words you start texting
[1:00:03] a lot you need to remember to talk to
[1:00:06] the
[1:00:08] parents right and and here's brother
[1:00:11] Brown talks about that now back in his
[1:00:12] days is way different okay but back in
[1:00:15] his day a boy would pull outside the
[1:00:16] house pull upside the house and blow the
[1:00:18] horn right and so he said so I I knew
[1:00:22] better than to stop outside and blow the
[1:00:23] horn for her to come out cuz her Dad
[1:00:25] wouldn't have been happy with that right
[1:00:27] well back then that was the way you know
[1:00:29] they didn't have text or whatever but
[1:00:31] he'd blow the horn why he said oh my any
[1:00:33] Boy hasn't got nerve enough to walk up
[1:00:35] to the house and knock on the door and
[1:00:36] ask for the girl ain't got no business
[1:00:37] being out with her
[1:00:39] anyhow right I'll say that if you're
[1:00:41] going to get somebody's number at Youth
[1:00:43] Camp and you're really interested in
[1:00:45] that girl you want to talk to her talk
[1:00:46] to her father and her mother and if you
[1:00:49] don't you need to be taught better right
[1:00:53] he said that's exactly right that's so
[1:00:54] silly really that's cheap now how much
[1:00:56] of that is my opinion a little bit of it
[1:00:58] I'll just be honest with you but I think
[1:00:59] it's pretty much the same thing what
[1:01:01] you're doing is you're bypassing respect
[1:01:04] you need to respect believe me if that's
[1:01:06] going to become your in-laws you really
[1:01:07] need to respect that
[1:01:10] person and and so talk to her father if
[1:01:12] there's no father in the in the
[1:01:14] situation talk to her mother talk to her
[1:01:15] pastor if you need to and that'd be a
[1:01:18] good source to go to the pastor can't
[1:01:20] put you together but he could he could
[1:01:21] tell you if there's some red flag
[1:01:24] something some reason why you shouldn't
[1:01:25] be doing that so before messaging one
[1:01:28] another on a regular basis that again
[1:01:30] that's just a guideline that's not law
[1:01:32] that's just something that was my
[1:01:33] thoughts as a dad and a pastor I'll say
[1:01:35] this far as I'm concerned my kids have
[1:01:37] no business on social
[1:01:39] media it's I can't control it how how am
[1:01:42] I expecting my kids to control
[1:01:45] it you real I delete my social media
[1:01:48] accounts like once a
[1:01:50] week and then I end up having to put a
[1:01:52] picture on there or something for the
[1:01:53] church you know and you get back on
[1:01:55] there and put it on there but you you
[1:01:57] you scroll too much you look too much on
[1:01:59] there and just being real and honest
[1:02:01] with you tonight if I do that I know
[1:02:03] look at the kids and I know when I was
[1:02:06] that age I couldn't have controlled it
[1:02:08] so my kids they have not been
[1:02:09] underprivileged by not having social
[1:02:11] media you can do what you want with
[1:02:12] yours but I it's a trap I I think and we
[1:02:16] have to remember how to control that
[1:02:18] little children shouldn't have an
[1:02:19] Internet connected phone it's just it's
[1:02:21] a trap and I'll say this if your if your
[1:02:24] child
[1:02:25] goes to someone's house they won't obey
[1:02:26] the rules at someone else's house don't
[1:02:28] be surprised if they don't ever get
[1:02:30] invited back because at my house if you
[1:02:32] have a phone it goes up put up at night
[1:02:35] so we don't allow our CH even our older
[1:02:37] children to have their phone at night
[1:02:40] and U thank the Lord right so they make
[1:02:43] sure they put those up and that long as
[1:02:45] they live there I guess that's the way
[1:02:47] it'll be so you know be careful who they
[1:02:50] hang out with not everybody calls
[1:02:51] themselves a a Christian is a Christian
[1:02:54] right right just because they go to
[1:02:56] youth camp don't mean they're
[1:02:58] saved right so we need to be careful who
[1:03:01] they hang out with that's why I like our
[1:03:03] children to go as a group because we
[1:03:05] know at least that they've got people
[1:03:06] they know and and that we know are not
[1:03:09] nuts because there's some there's some
[1:03:12] crazy people out there slow down
[1:03:15] emotionally I know I'm boring some of
[1:03:17] you to death but this
[1:03:19] important if you go to tell somebody say
[1:03:21] tell somebody you love them you know
[1:03:23] that's a that's a bigger deal than you
[1:03:25] think it is when you're a kid go tell
[1:03:27] somebody you love them you better mean
[1:03:28] it that's tell my daughter you love her
[1:03:30] you I've been expecting a ring soon you
[1:03:34] know don't get too close to someone you
[1:03:36] aren't serious
[1:03:38] about because it might have trouble down
[1:03:41] the
[1:03:41] road Paul says this he said I he said to
[1:03:44] the unmarried and widows it's good for
[1:03:46] them if they abide even aside in other
[1:03:47] words don't get remarried don't lose
[1:03:49] hope all you widows and widowers out
[1:03:51] there said but if they cannot contain
[1:03:53] let them marry is better to marry than
[1:03:55] to burn brother brandom said don't live
[1:03:57] a dirty little life he said it's not
[1:04:00] right he said that's your sister in one
[1:04:01] sense where if you're a Christian he
[1:04:03] said now if it's the world it's the
[1:04:04] world dog eat dog that's the way it is
[1:04:06] isn't it but this girl that you're going
[1:04:08] with that's your sister too that will be
[1:04:09] the mother of your children that will
[1:04:10] come don't live a dirty little life
[1:04:12] around her show her that you're a real
[1:04:13] Christian gentleman live like a
[1:04:15] Christian gentleman ought to treat her
[1:04:17] like your sister and when you get
[1:04:19] married still treat her that way amen we
[1:04:22] got to remember that we're Sons and
[1:04:23] Daughters of the
[1:04:24] King I'll say this I'm just going to get
[1:04:27] real plain for a minute we'll close I'm
[1:04:29] going to skip through some of this if
[1:04:30] you had a if you've got a problem with
[1:04:32] pornography or had one marriage won't
[1:04:34] cure
[1:04:36] that it warps your sense of right and
[1:04:39] wrong and I'll say this almost all
[1:04:40] television today would be Taboo in any
[1:04:43] other culture at any other time but
[1:04:46] people just watch it today and the
[1:04:48] commercials are are
[1:04:51] x-rated you know you you need to get get
[1:04:54] your mind right get your thought right
[1:04:55] get get the Holy Ghost before you get
[1:04:57] married amen so we need to understand
[1:05:00] that I'm going to skip past some of this
[1:05:02] of course brother brandom taught us we
[1:05:03] should never allow you girls should
[1:05:05] never allow a boy to kiss you before you
[1:05:08] raise the veil okay so that's the time
[1:05:11] to do that so slow down You' got time
[1:05:14] and but I a couple questions I've been
[1:05:16] asked I want to get to is it okay for me
[1:05:18] to have a boyfriend or a
[1:05:21] girlfriend all right I have no word from
[1:05:23] the Lord on this is me as a pastor and
[1:05:27] as a dad that's up to you parents but
[1:05:30] I'm okay I don't care if you call each
[1:05:31] other
[1:05:34] turnips he's my turnip
[1:05:37] okay I'm okay with that but that what
[1:05:41] that don't mean what it means today you
[1:05:43] understand a boyfriend today just means
[1:05:44] anything goes that's
[1:05:47] wrong you're not
[1:05:49] married right and you can't live
[1:05:51] together it doesn't give you a license
[1:05:52] for fornication just what the Bible
[1:05:54] calls it if you want to get to know
[1:05:57] someone in a public place when parents
[1:05:59] are or responsible adults are there
[1:06:01] that's fine that's the time of life
[1:06:02] you're in we shouldn't criminalize that
[1:06:05] our kids are going to have to learn to
[1:06:06] get along and and they should get to
[1:06:08] know one another church is a great place
[1:06:10] to find a wife youth Camp's a great
[1:06:13] place well it just becomes a dating game
[1:06:15] well I'd rather them date there than
[1:06:16] somewhere out in the
[1:06:17] world so I I it's just the time of life
[1:06:21] that they're in I'm glad I don't have to
[1:06:23] go back to that aren't you
[1:06:24] you but let them find the mind of the
[1:06:27] Lord for themselves then this one is it
[1:06:29] okay to date someone who's not a
[1:06:31] Believer I say this I think you need to
[1:06:33] examine your heart why would
[1:06:36] you why would you date someone that's
[1:06:38] not a Believer what's the
[1:06:40] purpose and I know the scripture and you
[1:06:42] know the scripture I've read it to you
[1:06:43] many times don't be unequally yolked
[1:06:45] together with unbelievers brand says no
[1:06:48] believer should ever marry an unbeliever
[1:06:49] under no circumstances should always
[1:06:51] marry Believers you say well we're not
[1:06:53] married we're dating
[1:06:54] why would you date someone who's not a
[1:06:56] Believer if you can't marry someone
[1:06:57] who's not a
[1:06:59] Believer so he said what's an unbeliever
[1:07:03] an unbeliever is someone who doesn't
[1:07:05] believe like you
[1:07:06] do I'm just just being honest with you
[1:07:09] someone who doesn't believe the message
[1:07:10] of the hour now they may believe it one
[1:07:12] day your future wife or future husband
[1:07:15] may be stocking shells at the grocery
[1:07:18] store right they may be out there let
[1:07:21] them come in first and then then you
[1:07:26] you're welcome to get to know him but I
[1:07:27] wouldn't do that you know if you do
[1:07:30] brother BR tells us this he said don't
[1:07:32] mix Mary he said marry a boy that
[1:07:34] believes just exactly like you do he
[1:07:36] said for after all God is the main
[1:07:38] important thing that we're in the earth
[1:07:39] to do is to serve him do you believe
[1:07:40] that you want to serve God with all your
[1:07:42] heart it's the most important thing he
[1:07:45] said and if you do marry or anything
[1:07:47] contrary that you'll pay for it in the
[1:07:48] days that lays ahead of you so let them
[1:07:51] come in let them get baptized receive
[1:07:53] the Holy Ghost watch them their life for
[1:07:54] a while you say well I'm going to
[1:07:56] convert them once we're married well if
[1:07:58] you're not strong enough a Christian now
[1:08:00] if you're not a strong enough Christian
[1:08:01] now to refuse to date an unbeliever you
[1:08:04] won't be strong enough Christian to
[1:08:06] bring make them bring them to church and
[1:08:08] get them saved once you're married right
[1:08:12] they'll I think they'll appreciate that
[1:08:13] strength that you have to do the right
[1:08:15] thing if you're not careful you end up
[1:08:17] like Ahab with a jezebel it's completely
[1:08:20] unfair to a girl or a boy to get their
[1:08:23] hopes up when you know you can't marry
[1:08:24] them it's just not fair to them you you
[1:08:28] pray for that person you know that again
[1:08:31] they may be out there but let them come
[1:08:33] in let them come in because down the
[1:08:36] road Prophet tells us you're going to
[1:08:37] have trouble if you do that and yet God
[1:08:40] can work out any situation do you
[1:08:41] believe that and some of you that made
[1:08:43] that mistake and God worked it out and
[1:08:45] praise God for that but we want to teach
[1:08:48] our children the truth Customs change
[1:08:51] but remember there's someone that God
[1:08:53] has for you you I'm so glad that when
[1:08:55] you you say well I don't have a husband
[1:08:57] or a wife and no prospects but you have
[1:09:00] him and he said he's better than a
[1:09:02] husband or wife father or mother aren't
[1:09:04] you glad you have him today there's
[1:09:07] somebody for you if if you're someone
[1:09:09] that's meant to be married and you're
[1:09:11] eligible to be married it's it's okay to
[1:09:13] have friends get to know people I don't
[1:09:14] want us to become a church that's known
[1:09:16] for rules that's not what we are but we
[1:09:19] want to make sure that we that we keep
[1:09:21] our children just give them the
[1:09:23] boundaries so they can be free so they
[1:09:25] can they can love God with all their
[1:09:27] heart and and meet someone and be happy
[1:09:29] God wants us to be happy he don't want
[1:09:31] us he's not assigned us to all be
[1:09:33] miserable he wants us to be happy
[1:09:35] brother brandom taught us that and you
[1:09:37] say what what should I do brother Ben I
[1:09:39] I just can't seem to find the right one
[1:09:41] just love God with all your heart love
[1:09:44] him with all your heart your soul and
[1:09:45] your mind and that one is waiting for
[1:09:48] you you just have to forget about it
[1:09:50] sometimes before you can meet them
[1:09:52] that's just the truth of it of it amen
[1:09:54] let's bow our heads together for just a
[1:09:56] moment I musicians go ahead and
[1:10:00] come I hope I haven't bored you this
[1:10:02] afternoon
[1:10:04] but we'll have more to say about it in
[1:10:06] the
[1:10:07] future and I'm learning too and I want
[1:10:09] you to know that as a pastor my kids are
[1:10:11] just now getting to an age and I'm sure
[1:10:13] there'll be things that happen and I
[1:10:16] hope you don't judge me too harshly for
[1:10:18] my children and uh they're they're human
[1:10:21] beings and I'll say this that
[1:10:24] I just want to see them love the Lord
[1:10:25] with all their heart and I want to see
[1:10:28] them have what I have I have a good
[1:10:29] marriage and and a wife that loves the
[1:10:32] Lord and I love the Lord I want to see
[1:10:33] them have that I realize sometimes
[1:10:36] things get broken things get hurt people
[1:10:38] get hurt but there's a God here who can
[1:10:40] put it all back together aren't you glad
[1:10:42] for that you can always go back to him
[1:10:44] kids you're sitting here today you can
[1:10:46] always go back to him if you get hurt if
[1:10:50] if you things get broken up you make a
[1:10:52] mistake don't don't just make make it
[1:10:53] worse just come back to the Lord it
[1:10:56] don't mean the end of it it don't mean
[1:10:58] because you did something wrong that you
[1:10:59] got to leave the message and run out in
[1:11:01] the world no you you love God with all
[1:11:03] your heart just just come back today's a
[1:11:05] new day it it's a new time don't don't

[1:11:09] back to the word you say what should I
[1:11:11] do I I'm in this situation I don't know
[1:11:13] how to get out of just love God with all
[1:11:15] your heart keep coming to church God
