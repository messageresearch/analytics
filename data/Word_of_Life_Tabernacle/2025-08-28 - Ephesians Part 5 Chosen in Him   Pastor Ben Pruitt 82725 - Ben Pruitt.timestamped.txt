[27:43] praise tonight.
[27:45] Amen. Are you happy?
[27:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Aren't you thankful for the cross

[27:54] And oh,
[27:57] how I love Jesus.
[28:04] We're singing Oh,
[28:09] how I love Jesus.
[28:17] Oh,
[28:19] how I love Jesus
[28:26] be because
[28:29] he first
[28:32] loved me.
[28:35] To me, he is so wonderful.
[28:37] to me.
[28:41] He
[28:43] so wonderful.
[28:48] Oh, to me.
[28:52] He is so wonderful.
[28:58] Oh, to me.
[29:02] He is so wonderful
[29:09] because
[29:12] he first
[29:14] love me. Oh, how I love Jesus again. Oh,
[29:19] we're singing, "Oh,

[29:30] We're singing, "Oh,

[29:42] Oh,
[29:44] how I love Jesus
[29:52] because
[29:54] he first

[31:36] many's ready for the word of the Lord
[31:37] tonight? Amen. I I think this is a time
[31:40] of the service when we can come together
[31:41] and we can forget about anything that's
[31:44] going on in the day, anything you're
[31:45] going to do tomorrow. Amen. The most
[31:47] important part of your day is going to
[31:48] be right now when the word of the Lord
[31:49] comes forth because the word can change
[31:52] you. How many believes that? I believe
[31:53] it does change you. Brother Brandon
[31:55] would say it like this. He said, "You
[31:56] either leave better or you leave worse."
[31:59] Let's leave better here tonight. Can we
[32:00] do that? Amen. Let's just get behind the
[32:02] word as he preaches tonight. Let him
[32:04] pour his heart out to us. And I believe
[32:06] I I I know there's something for us. God
[32:08] brought us here and God put him in the
[32:10] pulpit for a reason. So let's just open
[32:13] our heart to receive it tonight. Amen.
[32:15] With all of our hearts now, fill my cup,
[32:16] Lord. Fill my cup. If that's your
[32:18] desire, I want you to just put a hand up
[32:20] to him as we sing it now. Oh, fill my
[32:25] cup,
[32:27] Lord.
[32:31] I lift it up
[32:36] Lord.
[32:39] Oh come
[32:42] and quench
[32:46] this thirsting
[32:49] of
[32:51] my soul.
[32:56] Oh bread
[32:59] of heaven,
[33:03] won't you feed
[33:06] me till
[33:08] I want
[33:10] no
[33:12] more?
[33:15] Here's my cup.
[33:19] Fill
[33:21] it up and make me whole. One more time
[33:27] with all your hearts now. Here's my cup,
[33:29] Lord. Oh, here's
[33:33] my cup,
[33:36] Lord.
[33:42] Won't
[33:48] you come and quench
[33:55] this thirsting
[33:57] of
[33:59] my soul?
[34:02] Oh grant it Lord.
[34:04] Oh bread of heaven.
[34:11] Won't you feed
[34:14] me till
[34:16] I want
[34:18] no
[34:20] more?
[34:23] Here's my cup.
[34:27] Fill
[34:28] it up
[34:30] and make me whole.
[34:36] Let's bow our heads together for a word
[34:38] of prayer.
[34:39] Heavenly Father, just so grateful to be
[34:42] in your house once again. Lord, I pray
[34:44] you'd move me out of the way and speak
[34:46] to your people as only you can. May you
[34:49] speak lifegiving revelation, Lord, to
[34:52] every heart. Oh God, open up our hearts
[34:55] today. Lord, we want to know, not only
[34:58] know your word, but to know you better,
[35:00] oh God. I pray you'd grant that tonight.
[35:02] May your Holy Spirit come down, meet
[35:04] every need. God, I pray that there would
[35:06] be a a moment in the house of God
[35:09] tonight that we could go and we could
[35:11] say it was good to be in the house of
[35:13] the Lord and how our hearts burn within
[35:16] us, Lord, as you spoke to us. So, I pray
[35:18] you'd remove all the humanity, Lord, and
[35:20] may you speak directly to us tonight. I
[35:23] pray, God, that your word would be true
[35:25] and clear to us, Lord. Bind my lips so I
[35:28] wouldn't say anything that wouldn't be
[35:30] right. Pray if there's one here that's
[35:32] sick or in need, I pray that you'd meet
[35:34] that need, heal that sickness, Lord,
[35:36] pray that you'd do it now. We ask in
[35:38] Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. God
[35:44] bless you tonight. Ephesians chapter 1
[35:46] and verse 4. Ephesians chapter 1 and
[35:50] verse 4. We've gotten down to the fourth
[35:53] verse. I love uh going through the
[35:56] scriptures like this because it it
[35:57] causes you to deal with things maybe you
[35:59] wouldn't otherwise deal with uh as a
[36:02] complete sermon. But I believe the Lord
[36:04] is just going to help us tonight. Uh I
[36:06] want to speak about chosen in him.
[36:08] Ephesians 1:4 according as he hath
[36:12] chosen us in him before the foundation
[36:16] of the world that we should be holy and
[36:19] without blame before him in love. I pray
[36:23] the Lord would add his blessings to the
[36:24] word. You may be seated.
[36:27] This weekend's a holiday weekend, so
[36:29] we'll just have one service this
[36:30] weekend. Looking forward to our Sunday
[36:32] morning service.
[36:35] Paul tells the Ephesians that our
[36:37] redemption is not by chance. It's not
[36:41] because God is feeling sorry for us, but
[36:45] we have been chosen in him. And the
[36:49] Bible is very clear that salvation is
[36:52] not our choice, it's God's choice.
[36:56] &gt;&gt; So, we're going to go into that tonight.
[36:58] And and and we're going to talk about
[37:00] that that and it it kind of takes all
[37:02] the uh the the boldness out of you in
[37:06] the sense of well, I did something to to
[37:08] be here. I I earned my way into the
[37:11] kingdom of God. And and that's not
[37:13] biblical at all. It's a very modern
[37:16] construct, but the Bible is very plainly
[37:18] teaching that salvation is of God alone
[37:22] and not uh not of us. You find a good
[37:25] example of that in the scripture in the
[37:27] Old Testament with Abraham. And if
[37:29] you'll turn to Genesis 12 and verse one,
[37:31] we're going to be using a lot of
[37:33] scripture tonight, so keep those Bibles
[37:35] open. Genesis 12 and verse one uh speaks
[37:39] of Abram and how God called Abram. He
[37:42] said, "Now the Lord had said unto Abram,
[37:46] get thee out of thy country, from thy
[37:48] kindred, from thy father's house, unto a
[37:51] land that I will show thee."
[37:54] &gt;&gt; It doesn't say that the Lord talked to
[37:55] Joe and John and Bill and and Steve and
[38:01] they turned him down and so he went to
[38:03] Abram,
[38:04] &gt;&gt; right? It's not as if God came down into
[38:07] and started an evangelistic campaign and
[38:10] passed tracks out at every house and and
[38:13] then found Abram was willing to go and
[38:16] so he went
[38:17] &gt;&gt; called him. That's not what he did at
[38:19] all. He only spoke to one individual
[38:23] &gt;&gt; right in in the whole world at that
[38:26] time. One individual. Think about that
[38:29] for just a moment. You realize what the
[38:31] odds are? You realize what God has done
[38:33] for you and for me. What are the odds of
[38:36] being born into a message home? Think
[38:38] about that just for a moment. How many
[38:39] of you grew up in a message home? Most
[38:43] of us did. If you grew up in a message
[38:45] home, the odds of being born in a
[38:46] message home in the US is somewhere
[38:49] between 1 in4,000 and one in 7,000 in
[38:53] the US. If you go to the Congo, it's 1
[38:55] in 17. So there's a big difference
[38:58] depending on where you live. But here in
[39:00] the US, it's very it's very uncommon. In
[39:03] fact, it's more common uh to be a
[39:06] Southern Baptist or something like that.
[39:08] If you were the odds of being a Southern
[39:10] Baptist in in the US right now is one in
[39:12] 26 people just born into Southern
[39:15] Baptist homes. The fact you were born
[39:17] into a message home, you defied the odds
[39:20] to get there,
[39:21] &gt;&gt; right? God didn't just bring everybody
[39:23] into a knowledge even that God sent a
[39:26] prophet. He didn't tell everybody about
[39:28] it. And yet you're here and yet you
[39:30] believe it and you grabbed a hold of it
[39:33] when some of your siblings didn't and
[39:36] other people in the church didn't and
[39:37] and to Abraham and he's telling him I'm
[39:42] going to make you a great nation and
[39:44] there's no reason for it
[39:46] &gt;&gt; that Abraham can see
[39:49] &gt;&gt; right there there's no compelling reason
[39:52] why should God speak to me but there was
[39:54] a receiver inside of Abraham that could
[39:57] talk to God. There was a God
[39:59] consciousness in Abraham that didn't
[40:01] exist in any of his family, in any of
[40:03] his country. Listen, there was no such
[40:05] thing as a Jew in them days. There was
[40:07] no such thing as a Hebrew. Abram was the
[40:08] first one. And so, he was a gentile. He
[40:11] was just another normal person, just an
[40:14] everyday person. Brother Brandham said
[40:15] his his father was an idol worshipper.
[40:17] He said Abraham was out there one day
[40:19] picking berries. And when he was out
[40:20] there picking berries, the Lord began to
[40:22] speak to him. And there was something
[40:24] about Abraham that he would listen to
[40:26] the voice of the Lord. I believe there's
[40:27] a quality in the elect of God that we
[40:30] will listen to the word of God.
[40:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:35] Listen, I I don't mean to preach this. I
[40:37] want to teach it to you tonight, but I
[40:39] just it just blesses me to see it.
[40:43] &gt;&gt; Listen, he said, "I will make of thee a
[40:45] great nation. I will bless thee, make
[40:47] thy name great, and thou shalt be a
[40:48] blessing."
[40:50] And and Abraham, if you'll do everything
[40:52] I tell you to do, and if you don't mess
[40:55] up, and if you don't
[40:57] disbelieve me if you don't do this,
[40:58] that, or the other. That's not what he
[40:59] said. But I will bless them that bless
[41:02] thee.
[41:03] &gt;&gt; Curse him that cursseeth thee, and in
[41:06] thee shall all families of the earth
[41:09] &gt;&gt; be blessed.
[41:10] &gt;&gt; So Abram departed as the Lord had spoken
[41:13] unto him.
[41:15] &gt;&gt; The Bible says Lot went with him, but
[41:18] God did not call Lot out of,
[41:21] right? But Lot went with him. And Lot
[41:24] was blessed to be Abram's family, but he
[41:26] was not the elect of God. Abraham was.
[41:30] &gt;&gt; So he was 75 years old when he departed
[41:32] out of Herod. So God, he did not speak
[41:34] to a thousand people. And then the first
[41:36] one that said yes,
