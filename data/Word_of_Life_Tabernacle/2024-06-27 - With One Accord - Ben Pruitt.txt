pray Lord for for healing and comfort for the families I Lord I can't even imagine losing a child and I pray add my prayers with those that have already been prayed for the Pearson family Lord I I pray you just heal their minds and their hearts oh God I pray you'd help brother uh sister Fitzgerald Lord and the family there I I know God that you're able to do that and pray you'd Comfort them in their loss we thank you Lord for being here with us we ask you to come and now in this service speak to us Lord we pray in Jesus name amen amen thank the Lord uh we'll go to Acts chapter 2 and verse one tonight Acts 2 and 1 and then we're going to read from Philippians 22 acts 21 and Philippians 2:2 is it good to be in the house of the Lord on a Wednesday night I trust that it is says and when the day of Pentecost was fully come were all with one Accord in one place and were all with one Accord in one place then Philippians 2 two says fulfill you my joy that you be likeminded having the same love being of one Accord of one mind the Lord would add his Blessing to the word I want to you may be seated I want to speak on with one Accord on the day of Pentecost they were there on purpose they were there because Jesus told them to be there I think we could say the same thing about our service tonight we're here because he told us to come together to assemble ourselves together and worship and to wait on the promise of the father we're not waiting on the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost has already been given we're waiting on the promise of this hour which is the rapture of the church the change of our body so we're waiting on that and we believe but there's many other promises that we're waiting on tonight we're waiting on the promise of healing some of us we're waiting on our children maybe to be saved or or something to take place and and so we've got a goal in mind there's a uh there's a purpose why we're here and and I think that we should enter every service that way so they they wanted to be there they had the same goal in mind they were in one Accord and it was nice that nobody had to drag them to church they I just love to have church with people that want to be in church and and that want to be Fellowship around the word not just to be in a church church but to Fellowship around the word don't you just love having church with people who believe the message of the hour who just love it and and they'll back the word not because of who's saying it but because it's the word of God right because it's true and so it's just a wonderful feeling to know that you that you have one goal you've got one you're in one Accord you've got one mind and that's what one Accord actually means the word Accord in the original is from a a Greek word homothumadon which means unanimously or with one mind it comes from a root word from two root words which is homos which is the same and through most which is passion I believe we ought to have the same passion as as as they did back then to see the baptism of the Holy Ghost among us to see God move among us to to see the power of God manifested in our lives we don't want it just to be letter we don't want it just to be a a ritual that we go through something we do on Wednesdays and we do on Sundays we want it to be real sir and so if it's going to be real it's got to bring us into one Accord we got to want that we got to desire that or we'll never have it and so you know this doesn't mean that they were all in agreement on where to eat right or what to eat it doesn't mean that they were all in agreement on what color to paint the church yeah right it doesn't mean they were all in agreement on who the leadership should be right it doesn't mean they were all in agreement on those things but they were all in agreement on the things that matter and it's important when we come to the house of God it it's it's life or death we come out of here Better or Worse right and our kids deserve those breakthrough Services they deserve to be in the presence of God they deserve to have God moving among them we all of us need that we need the spirit of God to move Among Us and in order to do that we've got to be of one mind we we've got to get put everything else out of the way and our little difference in society and say Lord we we want you to move today we don't care who you move through we don't care in what manner you move but we want you to move and that's what we want we don't care if somebody else gets to sing or somebody else gets to preach or somebody else gets to gets the glory we want you to have the glory Lord we want to be in one Accord in one place and that's a powerful thing when you come in agreement in what matters I wonder how many of us tonight would say that we want to see Souls added to the church and added to the kingdom of God how many can say you'd like to see Souls born again I think every one of us would like to see that we like see the church filled up we like to see our kids up here in the front row every one of them have a real experience with God and and be filled with the Holy Ghost and never have to go out and experience the world we'd like to see that wouldn't we wouldn't you like to see that look at the book of Acts in Acts 246 it says they continuing daily with with what with one Accord in the temple and breaking bread from house to house that eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart praising God and having favor with all the people and the Lord what happened because they were in one Accord see they didn't just come in one Accord at Pentecost but they come in one Accord after Pentecost and they continued to be in one Accord and when they were in one Accord they the the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved so if you want to see Souls born in the kingdom of God you got to get in one mind about the things that matter are you with me so far it's listen to me Church I've got a burden on my heart tonight and I want to try to express it in the best way that I can it's not so important who shows up and how many show up but are the ones that are there in in one Accord in one mind Lord we want to see you move tonight we want to hear your word we want to hear you speak to us that's what's important the Lord adds to the church when those the church is in one Accord how many want to see the church refilled with the Holy Ghost amen how many need that I mean I think all of us could say every one of us need to be refilled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost we all need as brother brand said in deep call to the Deep an oldfashioned Holy Ghost Revival every one of us could say that and in Acts 4 we find again that they continued in one Accord when he said when they heard that and what had happened is the Pharisees and the Sadducees had told them Don't Preach no more all right we live in that kind of an age too when the Devil's trying to do away with preaching and and he said don't they said Don't Preach no more don't testify about Jesus don't tell the people what he's done and when they heard that they lifted up their voice to God with one Accord with one Accord and said Lord Thou Art God which has made Heaven and Earth and the Sea and all that in them is who by the mouth of thy servant David has said why did the Heathen rage and the people imagine vain things if you go down to verse 29 it says and now Lord behold they're threatening and Grant unto thy servants that with all boldness they may speak Thy word they didn't ask for a way out of the persecution they didn't ask even that the persecution would stop they just said Lord give us boldness oh I love that with one Accord they spoke they were in such Unity that their prayer was as one all their voices together but their prayer was written down because they were in such Unity they were all praying the same thing Lord give us boldness oh my I pray that ought to be our prayer today Lord give us boldness to speak your word by stretching forth thine hand to heal and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of th holy Child Jesus and when they had prayed the place was shaken where they were assembled together and they were all someone say all they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and they spake the word of God with boldness I want to be able to preach with boldness and these other brothers that preach they want to be able to preach with boldness you want to be able to testify with boldness what's it going to take to do that you're going to have to get in one Accord and the Holy Ghost to fall so that he can refill us to speak with boldness again because sometimes we get tired and we get weary and we get to where we're afraid of Our Testimony but we need the boldness of the Holy Ghost yes sir we got to have that these are not optional matters it's important stuff yeah how many of us would want to see God do Miracles yes we want to see signs and want this participation night you want to see signs and wonder I do I'm not against signs and wonders I we don't follow signs and wonders but signs and wonders follow us I want to hear testimonies of healing and we we do and I'm glad of that but we want to we want to see more we want to see Miracles we want to see God move well if you want to see God move guess what look acts 5 and: 12 and by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people and they were all with one Accord you want to see signs and wonders come in one Accord they were all with one Accord in Solomon's porch and of the rest D no man join himself to them but the people magnifi them and Believers were the more added to the Lord multitudes of both men and women in so much they brought forth the sick into the streets I'd like to see that again I don't know about you but I'd like to see that again you say well will we see a a great Revival no but I believe among us we can see a Revival I believe right here in the church we can see God move ain't much Faith out there very many places but I believe there's Faith here and I believe we ought to strive for that you want that you know and and so the way to have it is not to be critical in fact that's the way to not have it the way to have it is to come in one Accord right so now he he said that that least the shadow they brought forth the sick in the streets laid them on beds and couches that at least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them there came also in verse 16 a multitude out of the Cities round about unto Jerusalem bringing sick folk and them which were vexed with unclean spirits and they were healed everyone why they were in one Accord and if you go on down begin to read on down you find that they were arrested again so it didn't make the devil happy right the devil wasn't happy but they were in one Accord how many of you would like to see joy in the house of God right you didn't realize this was so important did you when we come to the house of God we've got to we've got to put our effort into we got to put our mind into we got to it's something we do we do on purpose right and so if you'd like to see Joy back in the house of God when Philip went to Samaria and preached Christ to them acts 85 acts 86 the people with one Accord with one Accord what did they do gave heed unto those things which philli spake sir they heard the word with one mind and when they heard the word that way they hearing and seeing the Miracles which he did for unclean spirits crying with loud voice come out of many that were possessed with them many take with pusies that were lame were healed and there was great joy in that City would you like to see Joy back in your home again would you like to see joy in the house of God again I say I say Amen to that I'd like to see Joy back in my own life and I've got joy but I want more joy don't you we got joy in the church we want more joy in the church we want to see God move how can we do that when we listen to the word with one Accord it brings Joy you want to see gifts operating in the church come on we do we want them in order but we want to see them operate we want God's gifts in the church listen what a prophet of God said now we're going to get into some quotes here brother brandham deals with this this week I I read over 500 quotes about this and just spent about eight hours just constant just reading and reading and reading and I put it all down and I got I got so I looked at it and I thought that's about seven hours right there so I just started taking stuff out taking stuff out taking stuff out cuz brother Bram talks about it all the time must have been a purpose in it God cannot give back the gifts to the church as long as his church is divided right we've got to get the church together first for the gifts can come right but if all the Full Gospel people would come one a heart and one ACC core there would be a Revival that would shake the whole world and every spiritual gift would be in the church listen to this listen to the power of coming in unity in the house of God yes he said in one hour's time within an hour's time yeah after it took place do we really believe that but see a lot of times it's not malevolence right it's not it's not that somebody's somebody sometimes it is but most of the time it's not most of the time it's just your mind drifts right M my mind drifts we get we get think about other things we get to look at other things we get busy during the week and we go to church like we pray sometimes and we just do it it's just it's just another service oh my but how much more could the preacher preach to to us if we would pray for the preacher if we'd be in one mind about that how much how much better would the song leader sing if we'd be in one mind of crying out to God and saying Lord we need a song service tonight we need God to move in the song service you believe he will I believe he does that how much better would the special singer sing if we if we prayed for him first if we took care to do that you said well do we need to have a special prayer you can pray while you're sitting here you can but you got to be in one mind about that yes sir that the service it doesn't it's you know that's the hardest thing when a military goes out you've got to have Unity of of purpose about what you're doing yeah because if you don't you can't ever win a war and we're in a battle Church we're fighting demons here tonight we're fighting Devils we're fighting the prince of the power of the air some of you are fighting sickness you're fighting discouragement you're fighting all kinds of different things and it's about time we come together with one purpose we're going to kill this devil we're going to get rid of him I don't want to see I don't want to see one person dragged out into the world I don't want to see one lost I want want to see everyone come to the house of God and come in one mind and one Accord yes are you with me so far yes Heen said every spiritual gift that would would be in the church within an hour's time after it took place that's powerful signs and wonders that was done by the apostles would be a minor thing to what would do if we could just get the church together right all right we got meetings coming up Church let's be in one Accord because it's hard to get 300 people in one Accord right but but let's be in one Accord let's be of one mind going into the meetings because we don't know who might be there that might need help we don't know who might be there who might be at the at the turning point of their life yes and it would make a difference if we were of one mind about the meetings right oh brother B said oh Christian people by find yourselves together with one heart and one Accord for God cannot no more send the gifts to the church the church is separated then he can send the Holy Ghost unless we're in one Accord other say you might you know we get lots of things that bother us I know for for many of you it's too cool in here in the summer and uh there's a reason why we keep it this cool because then it gets too hot if we don't and and so it's just one or the other and and people are too cold or too hot and I know that's a con thing in the church and and some people like the seats and some people don't like the seats and some people like the preacher and some people don't like the preacher and so every decision you make there's always going to be uh you know somebody that doesn't like it but but yet if we could just get past that I want to read you something you say brother Ben well if the temperature was right I I could really I could really worship listen to what brother BR says in this next quote he said he's talking about the day of Pentecost he said if it was hot there was such a Unity of spirit until they didn't even feel the heat I want to have church like that can you imagine so well I don't want to go to them meetings man all them people man that the building gets hot and the air might break down and but if it was hot there was such a Unity of spirit until they didn't even feel the heat he said now if we could just get that way wouldn't it be wonderful yes sir he said we wouldn't notice this heat all right now brother Harvey he didn't say we wouldn't notice the cold but we can kind of extrapolate that I guess right watch brother Brandon was constantly trying to get the people in one Accord why because he had a Supernatural Ministry he was a prophet of God he had a Supernatural Ministry and he knew that that gift as mighty as it was as great as it was couldn't operate like it should unless the people were in one Accord and I want you to see how much you have to do with the service you young people up here in the front you got a lot to do with the service you young ladies you got a lot to do with the service the way you come the attitude you come in the the way you view the preacher the way you view the song leader the way you the way you approach the service it it all matters for the service and so brother Brandon's always trying to get them in one Accord he said if he says this he said you know we're dealing with people who are sick he said he said if they cannot be touched by God they're going to die right away and your Disobedience might hinder their faith all right well Church you realize how serious it is so let's just all believe with one Accord now and let us say Lord Jesus I believe you he said and that'll make a a wall of Faith all the way around that's what I'd like to see here in the service tonight just a wall of Faith all the way around let it go all the way into the meeting that no devil could come in it just be a wall of Faith yes are you with me now make a wall of Faith all the way around brother brandham taught us and I don't have time to read all the quotes but you can go find them that the 30,000 that were saved at one time in his Africa campaign he said that was because they were of one mind in one Accord yeah Africans who had never heard the gospel right but they were of one in one Accord one mind in one place amen and he said that America needs missionaries yeah he said you go into a congregation this one says well he said No at night time even in this little handful of people he said you sit here and feel one coming here and here and here and here just everywhere people one in thinking this and one thinking that he said why I know what they're thinking about I am so glad I don't have that gift but I can read faces I've done this for 25 years I can read faces right I'm not bragging about that it's just I've been preaching since I was a kid I can read faces and so it it does it affects the preacher it affects the service right and so he he said he said I I know what they're thinking about sure I do God reveals it one of them saying well Dr so and so said it was mental telepathy this one says well he's a spiritualist and this one says it's a devil he said that's the reason the Holy Spirit can't move yeah he said you see it's got to be one Accord got to be one Accord and then God's blessings and Power will pour upon his people right listen if you had a man in the pulpit and I I I deny that I am that man I believe I'm a man of God or I wouldn't be here right I believe you're men and women of God but if you had a charlatan if you had a hypocrite standing in this Pulpit if you had a an attitude towards him that he was a charlott and and a hypocrite that's what you'd get out of it right but if he was even reading the Bible and he he said something out of the scripture CU that's God's word that was true and you had a positive attitude towards that word it could have as much effect on you as if he was a man of God right but the only thing keeping you from having that effect is keeping us from having that is our own attitudes all right are you with me now still with me you want to see God move I want to see him move let's get in one mind in one Accord brother brand when it would just get the faith would just get right he said it looks all milky all over the building why because the presence of God was there by Caleb and he could see that the people were all praying they were all calling out to God and there was a difference in the service go listen to the prayer lines in some places brother bam struggles he he he he rebukes the people he tries so hard no don't move around don't do this that or the other because they were just constantly doubting they were constantly doing those things and at other meetings it just seemed like it was on fire what was that it was when a group of people could come in one mind Accord and say this is the gift of God and we're going to Rally behind it so and this one he said this one says it's a devil that's the reason the Holy Spirit can't move he said it's got to be one Accord see he got to be one Accord and then God's blessings amen how many want His blessings His blessings and power will pour upon his people when we're in one Accord see we're in one Accord when we love one another right we love one another and lo doesn't mean when you love somebody you tend to overlook things when you don't love somebody you don't tend to overlook those things right right the problem is the lack of love the problem is not the things right and that happens in a marriage the problem is not that he uh he didn't do exactly what you wanted him to do for the hundredth time that's not the problem he used to overlook that same with the wife it's not that she didn't do exactly what you wanted to do a thousand times you used to overlook that what is it you grown cold right there's less love we ought to love one another right and when we love one another we come in one Accord brother Brown said the people in America had become indifferent towards God oh that's that's a quite a charge especially that long ago think what it is today they' become indifferent towards God he said and the reason we become so indifferent towards God is because we're indifferent towards one another see when we get in one Accord then God comes down see if you don't love one another and believe in one another you can never be in one Accord what do we talk about Sunday Abraham had to believe in something almost impossible and you've got to believe in your brothers and sisters you got to believe that they're going to be there one day you got to believe that and when you're taking communion together that one day you'll be there at the marriage supper and you there's got to be something in you that believes you'll see each other again and then it gets to where it's hard to leave the church cuz you want to Fellowship so bad you want to be around each other so bad brother BR said his church was that way early on and the people said come to him and said how did you get them all in one Accord how did you do that well he said it wasn't me he said they all got born again oh thank the Lord oh that's what we ought to that's the we we just need our maybe our minds need to be Washed by the Water of the word until we can come in one Accord amen said when we get in one Accord and God comes down what we need is the Holy Ghost atmosphere he said that's right an atmosphere where the power of God's are moving one Accord one place gathered together under that atmosphere of expecting God to move down and do signs and wonders listen if you expect me to make a mistake while preaching I will I promise you I will you'll get exactly that cuz I could find many mistakes you missed if you're looking for them I I can show you some but look oh my but but he's okay with and so I'm okay with it is that right like like I believe he I believe he's okay with me I I believe I'm born again I believe I'm Washed by the Water of the word and I believe you are too and so we're okay with one another right now look he he said say Lord he said I'm just believing say say Lord I'm just believing that you're going to pour your blessings how many times we come to church like that all right well it's Wednesday night huh but Lord I'm expecting you realize they'd already been 10 days in a row in that c in that hot upper room right they'd already put up with that for 10 days and not everybody stayed there were 500 people who watched Jesus literally watched him go up into the heavens and 380 of them found something better to do after 10 days but by the by the time Pentecost come the ones that were there were of one mind yes we shouldn't knock a Wednesday night service because maybe this would be the time we could come in one mind one Accord with one another look he said I'm expecting it now all things are moving right in I'm expecting to see the exceedingly abundantly now I'm expecting you come down and say well I don't know about it he said well see you hurt the other person so it's more than just us you come to church with an attitude of well here here it is again I'm going to get preached at again well that's what you hurt the other person right but what about the attitude of Lord help my pastor he he he he he's struggling he he he's got some things he has to do too but but he's struggling sometimes and and sometimes I do struggle but if we could only come in one mind one Accord and I'm not saying you just have to pray for me but everybody that stands behind the sacred desk and everybody this is a this is an awful place to stand in yeah do you realize that it's an awful place we're just a small group even when we're all together we're not a great group as far as in number but we're but we're the people of God you're you're the blood purchase of God I hold that in my hands and I realize what I say matters you think I don't feel that I do feel that but I I realize I've just got to do my best I I got to live I got to be a I got to be a human being and yet I've got to be a try to be a preacher and every one of these preachers it's an awful place to stand in and yet knowing that you everything you say people take one way or take the other but yet you've got to have the right attitude towards that and say Lord I'm expecting something to move tonight I'm expecting you to move I'm not looking at who's there and who's not there I'm expect the preacher got to have that expectation too I'm expecting you to move and when the preacher has that expectation and the people have that expectation God's got to do something are you with me now Oh my he said well he said now you're he said now you're sitting by one of them so in other words if you were in church you're sitting by somebody that has a bad attitude that he said you say oh Lord just tear him down now in other words just tear down those walls tear down that attitude I I'm I'm expecting great things he don't let it affect you he said and that expectancy will get that Unity among the people he said that's what happened on the day of Pentecost what brought the Holy Ghost in the first place yes see your attitude my attitude sets the atmosphere of the service yeah right they were blessing god brother B said that's what they were doing in the upper room he says that in several places they were blessing God for a promise in seed form many times the reason we don't have results is because we want to wait until the results get here to worship yeah right and what we worship is we worship in seed form right we have healing in seed form it's a promise we have salvation h full salvation the change of the body in seed form yeah right and and in seed form our expectations many times are in seed form but if we bless him in seed form he said they had the Holy Ghost as a promise and they blessed him for that promise they said Lord thank you for giving me the promise if we'd have that kind of attitude Lord thank you for giving me the promise of a good service thank you for giving me the promise of healing thank you for giving me the promise of my children we begin to bless him that way we'd see God begin to move that's what they were doing brother R said he was in a meeting like that in Wood River where the whole people just come in expectation he said they they just stacked up the the Wheelchairs and the crutches because the people come like that and so he talked about the law of God and how it brings results he said you irrigate by the law of gravity right he said you don't have a a pond full of water and a and a crop over here and you don't look at that water and say well I wish that water would get over here on my crop all right right that's not how that works what do you do you use gravity gravity is the law of God and you dig a trench or something that causes the water to go from over here to over where you need it right and so brother BR said you use the law of God to bring results he said well now look God is here this afternoon he said now we got to follow the law of God the law of God is one Accord right love one for the other so you realize when we're not in one record it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy right that that we actually can hinder the service and then produce what we thought we were going to get a bad service yeah right Discord but if we'd come in one Accord right oh my look he said oh my there you are he said we got to follow the law of God the law of God is one Accord love one for the other oh my there you are one Accord everybody under expectations that God is going to pour down his power and he said he talked about the meeting said in these meetings you're laboring against everything the some of these were just remarkable I I left out many more remarkable quotes about this but we just don't have time he said here you are standing on the platform he said in a bank of spirits he said when you break into a Channel of spirit for a vision he said everybody praying some doubting some this way some that way and he talked about the man that Jesus led away from the city right and the man that Jesus leted away from the city remember he had to lead him away from the city and he put Clay on his eyes spit on the ground made clay put it on his eyes and told him to go wash but first he had to get him away from the city he talked about the girl who died and Jesus put out everyone but Peter James and John he didn't even let all his disciples go in yeah now think about it for a minute he couldn't even let his own disciples come in because not all of them would have believed but Peter James and John were Believers and so he brought them in and when he brought them in you can go read the the story in The Book of Mark I believe it is and brother Bram says this about that he said you got to have Unity Harmony everything in one Accord he said then the Holy Spirit should never have to have but one prayer here at the platform everything would take place just that would end it we could just be in one Accord now we can battle through right we're warriors that's what we're here for we battle through Spirits we battle through these things we battle through attitudes battle through our own attitudes battle through other people's attitudes right we do that we're warriors but how much better would it be if we showed up right I believe I'm talking to mature Christians tonight for the most part how much better would it be if you showed up if we showed up with that kind of attitude lord it's going to be a good service tonight yes now brother BR says you all keep in one Accord he said you got a battle of little unbelief leavs pitched around the wall tonight you imagine being a prophet being able to see all of that I just can't even comprehend it he said it's a battle of little unbelief pitched around the wall he said now I want you to have faith you see he said it's a hard battle all right all right he said if you just remember I'm trying to represent the Lord Jesus Christ to the people he said and it just keeps going from me you realize he was a prophet but yet he he would start to have a vision and this little unbelief over here and little unbelief over there and this battle of unbelief that's going on would cause it to leave him right and that's why he tell people don't get up and leave don't don't do that because because it affects me what was it he wanted he needed the people to come in one mind and one Accord looking with expectation for what God would do and many times we think well you know if we had a bigger crowd we could be in more in one Accord and actually that's not true right right some times during our meetings we do have a big crowd in one Accord and sometimes we have a big crowd in many Accords right Andy someone said that was the real miracle was the fact that they all got in a Honda but anyway but but but there you know sometimes you got people with all kinds of different ideas looking all kinds of different ways some come Skeptics some come different ways and yet God can still God still works but sometimes a smaller group is easy here to get in one Accord so that ought to take that excuse away that Wednesday night excuse away from us right right because sometimes a smaller groups easier to get in one mind M said God never comes in Great Gatherings because it's a great Gathering right right he don't look out there and say well there's 300 people there tonight boy I'm going to move tonight there's three people there tonight boy nothing that nothing I can do that's not what he said is it said we're two or three are gathered together there am I in the midst of them right but he said God doesn't come in Great Gatherings because it's a great Gathering he comes because the hearts are in one Accord and expecting him to come and it is true that the more people you can get together the more licks of fire you can get together that are in one Accord the better off you are right the better service you can have but sometimes you got to fight through that but listen here is a local church you understand visitors will come in and maybe that visitor probably won't be in Accord with us you they don't they don't know especially if they're not a Christian they they won't be in one mind in one Accord with us they may be bored they may be uh they they may be unhappy they may be they come here for some reason God sent them here now now what if we could be in one mind and one Accord and then that one person comes in you see how easy that battle is right all you got to waade through is that one spirit and if you can ever get to them maybe they could be changed right but if that one person comes in and sits on the back and I'm just and you're just waiting through spirit it's all the way through the congregation that's a problem yeah right because you never even get to the person that needed help right right so God does that he said look he comes because the hearts are in one Accord and expecting him to come look at Jesus to the humblest of church two or three are gathered in my name and and we come in one Accord and I I'm I'm rushing through this tonight and I wish I had that seven hours but I don't and I won't won't take it and I won't even take your time past what I normally do but they were in one Accord because they had one promise One Promise they were in an upper room all in one Accord he said not saying my church is better than yours I belong to this over here and our church has the best steeple they were all in one place cooperating in the Revival all in one Accord for they had the promise of something I I I believe that as message people we ought to come together when we have a meeting and and even in our local churches we're in one Accord with all the other message churches on what we believe a Rapture is coming we got a promise of a Rapture let's be in one Accord on that anybody that believes in the Rapture of the church let's be in one Accord on that we got to agree on something but brother Brandon said the American people had a difficult time coming into that Unity into one Accord he said oh my American brothers and sisters don't lay in this lull that you American people are laying in he said why in India let that happen he said let happen what just happened now every person on the grounds would get up and walk away he just discerned the secrets of the heart and this person the Lord had God had used brother brandom to do that brother brandom said if if that happened in India he said every person on the ground get up and walk away why they be healed right tens of thousands would be healed at one time yeah that's right he said but we well we wonder we're so educated we're so smart he said it's too bad I don't mean maybe you people here but that Spirit of America he said we know it all we know all about it a know-it-all religious spirit is a terrible demon it's harder to get rid of than a than a smoking habit hard to get because it's pretty easy to look at a smoking habit and say that's wrong it's hard to convince a person with a religious spirit that they got a problem right it's a terrible devil and and brother brandham says that he said oh and that's that's America everybody's religious they might be smoking be Rel drinking be religious but he said oh if you could just get out of that crust let your heart get smooth and tender before God you could realize your poor humble brother has nothing to do with this or if we could just get away from that he said if you could only see what I see he said that cold indifferent foggy look hanging around come on church that's not all just how hard we work I know we work hard but it's the spirit of the age we got to fight that we got to fight that you got to grab your sword pick it up with me I I'm do doing I'm asking somebody to come with me brother Brand It just strikes me so hard when he preached with why little bethle H he said oh he said I'm standing in a terrible place he said you you ministers he said somebody come stand with me and stand for the word of God stand for the power of God he said give God a drink of Pentecostal water oh I wonder tonight if we could do that just looking for somebody to stand with me and say let's fight this devil of coldness let's fight the apathy let's fight the lukewarmness let's go forward in God somebody stand with me don't if if you believe in what I believe and and what do I believe the message if you believe the message of the hour let's stand in unity today yes believe we're going to be sit on the throne one day together huh the brand said if we get away from that indifferent foggy look hanging around trying that's what making you feel he said just can't raise up and accept it all at once it's because that hangs over you said if I could ever get that broke all right I I've watched many times I sometimes I can tell when something I don't know about your life is spoken over your life and and something happens in your and it happens more often than people realize where somebody will I don't stand up here and talk about it but I'll preach something and somebody will say that was just right down my alley and you can see it when it happens because you see their face change you see their attitude change because they realize oh oh he you know this but if there's that foggy coldness about them and if there's that that that bitterness or that grudge against somebody they just can't receive it and I'll watch it and it'll go out but they'll never receive it and it may be just as real and just as much for them but it's the receiver you know you got to if you're not getting a radio signal it's either the the radio station or the receiver one or the other and I'll say this the radio station is the Holy Ghost you believe the Holy Ghost is is is right you believe operates correctly then it must be the receiver right and either my receiver your receivers you know what so we have to come with that attitude now he said have faith now if I could ever get that broke if I ever get the people just in one Accord what would take place he said well I've seen it he said have faith now we oughtn't to have to bring anyone else in other words he it wasn't a show he shouldn't have to bring people up there Time After Time After Time about kill himself one time should have done it and they should have believed and so places that happened but we you say well if it was really of God unbelief wouldn't hinder it Matthew 13:58 he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief I don't want that to be written about me I don't want that to be written about our church they did not many mighty works because of unbelief I want to I believe you're Believers tonight and I trust that we can all come in one mind and one Accord well the B says it's the attitude of the people that brings the results that's the reason that Pentecost they had to go go in Upper Room pray until the Holy Ghost came cuz they got in one place in one Accord it's the atmosphere that brings the results he said you believe that yeah you believe that you know how hard it is this is true when you ask for a show of hands on something you know how much of the audience is with you based on how many respond and I know some people never want to respond to anything right and uh there's some people who sat in church for years and never acknowledge they were saved you know but but it's okay to respond yes sir because it shows Unity right and so when you when you ask for a response and sometimes you'll ask for a response how many glad to be here tonight and you know just I got people raising their hands but personal say that how many glad to be here brother Allan knows this brother Joel knows this and Caleb keeps raising his hand they you're gonna make me laugh and I won't be able to preach but they'll say that and how many you glad to be here and and nobody raised their hands you know how that it's like well what do we do Where Do We Go From Here yes right sometimes brother Joel say and I know it's just a habit you know you say things you know he'll say how many are ready for the word everybody just well I'm not rebuking you but you see what a difference it makes what if we could say Amen maybe that's all you could get Jason you maybe just say Amen it's real quietly you know amen if you just say that that would make a difference in the service I made just see your mouth the words I may not even hear it but it might encourage me right it might encourage brother Joel might encourage brother Allen or somebody else brother Andrew when he stands here these are these are men of God coming in the meeting I believe that brother wend brother Allan brother Shawn and brother Daryl Ward and we've seen God mooving these men's Ministries I know that they're men of God and yet but we have to have a response a quick response how can we do that by coming with the right mind and what one Accord are you all still loving me tonight [Laughter] many of you do what what creates an atmosphere I got to get out of this our faith does yes right brother BR said now you've got to create an atmosphere I skipped past one or two but he said you got to create an atmosphere and your faith will do it he said they were all in the upper room with one Accord when suddenly they're come from Heaven as a sound of a rushing Mighty Wind the atmosphere was right yeah he said it takes an atmosphere to do anything he said let this little handful of people sitting here tonight get in the perfect atmosphere watch what takes place there will not be a feeble one in our midst so I pray God would do it tonight the cripples will walk the blind will see the deaf will hear the dumb will speak without prayer or anything it's the atmosphere yeah he said that's how 25,000 was healed at one prayer in Africa when they seen the Lord do something it created an atmosphere and they stepped into it oh church we don't do he said that's the pool when the waters is running right what's he talking about the pool of Bethesda when the waters were stirred step into it you got to step into it and when you step into it God can move now each one of us brother BR says is a Dynam right a Dynamo I had to look that up what a Dynamo was brother Harold's smiling at me cuz but he knows what that is but a Dynamo and a Dynamo is a generator right like pretty kind of y'all can correct me later but you think about it like this it's a unit that produces power right each one of us produce something positive energy negative energy Faith unbelief right we're just sitting there generating you can't turn it off right you can't be neutral it's just all the time right just a Dynamo now we could take these air units isn't that wonderful that we got cool air in the church isn't that wonderful praise God but but you look at the at those air units and if we put two of those on heat and one of them on cool you'd notice the difference cuz the one it the two would affect the one it would have a very difficult time keeping it on and even if you put one on heat it it would it would change the temperature it would change how hard these others have to work uh when we did the fellowship H the other day the AC man told me he said you know I said 'well this other one said it had a code on it that you need to check it he said' that's just cuz it was working so hard right that's why sometimes we get error codes you know we're just working so hard and and we're working all by ourselves but that middle one that middle air conditioning unit had a mouse crawled in it and so it wouldn't the the the uh the thing wouldn't Spin The Fan wouldn't Spin and that's all it was man just reached up here took the mouse out put it up there and then probably send us the bill but but that's all that's all it took was take the mouse out maybe we just need to get the mouse out of our Lives come on Church brother BR said every person is a spirit every one of you got a soul when you go to believe in it's in that channel of Faith he said you believe that certainly and if you get with one Accord that's when the Holy Spirit will just move in yes amen he said if you'll just all forsake your thoughts for a little bit just get in one Accord oh if you'll just let every heart beat the same towards Christ tonight you'll see exceedingly abundantly he said now remember that Feast on the word believe with all your heart enter into it get into the service get into the worship don't be ashamed just in your heart he said I don't mean you have to scream if you feel like screaming that's up to you that doesn't profit too much but if you'll just get into the worship of it oh Jesus how lovely you really are I never knew you so sweet he said that's when you get into it that's when God comes down pours His blessings right over everywhere said that's when something happens listen we should want our attitudes every service our atmosphere to be right for the sake of others right now if if we don't need anything say I don't need anything well for the sake of somebody else for the sake of God's people for the for the sake of these children let's Let It Be Right the said God wants somebody can hold in his hands he talks about how that they can I can send my sick servant to the brandom Tabernacle and that group of people are one Accord something will happen he said well look what he does for us in the condition that we're in he said what would he do if we were one heart and one Accord look what he does for us anyway by Grace he provides what would he do if we were in one heart and one Accord he said the only way we can do that listen you want to know how to do it tonight the only way we can do that is unify our hearts together with Brotherly Love uh oh I don't know if that says what it I don't know if I saw that one obey the officers of the church Church the pastor and the pastor obey God pastors got to be obedient too right he said that's the only way to come in one mind and one Accord oh church we don't realize sometimes what we do and we just sitting there and we just well I've had a bad day and he preached too long if we could just get in one Accord that's good yes listen he said then God works to the pastor through the board down into the Church all together one unit to the kingdom of God then God will hear when we have a unified group he said let nothing bother you don't be dismayed at anything he said no that's the kind of person God ordained to take the land Moses was complete he was a man that wouldn't compromise if there were stews and fusses and so forth he wouldn't compromise that's what God wants us now why because he knew he he had to take everyone into the presence of God remember he said pharaoh wanted to agree he said Moses you all can go but you leave your children behind or leave some of your cattle back here he said that's the way the devil wants a Christian to come it'll be all right for you to join the church but don't you never forgive Jones you don't have to give up you're smoking you're drinking you're lying you're stealing your fault finding backbiting you don't have to give that up just join the church but Moses wasn't a compromiser he wanted complete deliverance he said we'll not leave one hoof behind we'll take everything that belongs to us when we go to Worship the Lord oh that we could come to the house of God like that we would not compromise on one uh one bad thought or one thought there was outside the word of God we would cast down everything that exalted itself against the word he said that's the way the church ought to be he said we'll take righteousness we'll take Holiness we'll take the Holy Spirit we'll take a unified group when we go to the altar we'll be a real group we'll leave nothing behind we'll take everything someone say everything we'll take everything there won't be one who stay back here he said you know when people can pray in such a way till the devil will have to give in than the Lord where are we sitting we're sitting in Heavenly places he said he hath hath past tense raised us up together together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus church squabbles isn't Heavenly places fussing and fighting isn't a Heavenly place right our homes ought to be a Heavenly place our churches ought to be a Heavenly Place Heavenly places he said now just not out anywhere but in Heavenly places we're Syble that means the position of the believer and if I'm prayed up and you're prayed up the church has prayed up we've assembled ourselves we're ready for the message we've assembled ourselves together as Saints called out baptized with the Holy Ghost filled with God blessings called elected set together in Heavenly places and now we are heavenlies in our souls all sins under the blood oh isn't that where you want to sit that's where I want to sit tonight in that's our position in Christ all sins under the blood in perfect worship with our hands up to God our hearts lifted sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus worshiping together in Heavenly places brother BR says this I'll read this one and I'm going to close I've got quite a bit more but I'll just read this brother Brandon said we are very happy and so thankful to God for his goodness and mercy Mercy he said you people giving your spirit over to him in cooperation did you ever think about coming to church like that you give your spirit over to Christ in cooperation so that he can lead us and guide us he said see if you've got a resenting audience the Holy Spirit won't even reveal you say why why why can't the preacher preach Revelation to me come on church I don't believe you're a resenting audience but we don't want to ever get that way God won't reveal himself to a resenting audience he said you got to have something that working together in one place in one Accord then there come a sound from Heaven rushing he said no matter how much I'd pray and lay down lay day and night studying and praying before the Lord walk down here maybe the anointing on me walk up here and feel that resentment see he said it just Grieves him right away he won't reveal nothing but when you walk down here under the anointing and feel your audience under the anointing that's when the Holy Spirit begins to work then and it begins to move and do great things for us amen amen we're in one Accord by the Holy Ghost do you believe that today brother brandham says this musicians go ahead and come he said as the days grow closer and closer I'm sorry brother Robert I'm skipping and the narrowing of the path we want to go closer together we we must just be one body we must just move together forgetting one another's sins and our differences and just sticking closer and closer and closer as we see that day approaching you know we got to give God some credit sometimes you just give him some credit God I know you called the pastor you called the preacher I'm just going to give you the credit that you knew what you were doing I can't see it but you know I wouldn't have called him but I'm going to give you some credit God I'm going to take my hands off this and let you let you work through your man let you work through my husband my wife my brother my sister assemble yourselves together forget one another's sins our differences just sticking closer and closer and closer as we see that day approaching assembling ourselves together all with one Accord and one heart and if a brother sister gets out of the way in any way don't do nothing but pray for that person in love always considering one another don't never let one of you get away that's my desire I don't want to I've had to say things before and had to take a stand and people leave and I don't want to do that that's not my heart I don't want to but I've got to my job as a pastor is to protect the Sheep you realize my job as a pastor as my pastoral role as a minister I want to win souls my job as a pastor is to protect the Sheep that's what he called me to do that's number one job number one protect the sheep and I can't wait on something bad to happen to to protect sheep because y'all could do that y'all could react to situations but God gives a pastor to be able to see it coming right that's what that's the whole purpose so you've got to have a you got to you got to let the pastor do that right you got to let them do that you got to let the brother and sister do that that God I don't realize I don't it may not make any sense to me but God you do that but I don't want to see one person get away I want to see everybody worshiping together I'm all for it yes I've thought before what a wonderful time it would be if we just all worship together we get in these meetings a little bit of taste of that right and we don't agree with everybody that comes in here right we don't agree with every preacher and everything but we agree on the big stuff we agree that God sent a prophet we agree that the message of the hour is right we agree that the the blood was spilled on the cross for our s right we agree but you realize when you get in the way of God and his method of working in things that you actually you actually cause you affect other people and I affect other people we we just want to stay in the in the right mode and stay in one Accord don't we don't we want to do that love one another never let one of you get away stay together now look if somebody you see somebody not in church it's not you know I do I always I try to call call somebody or talk to them I'll give them a little time you see somebody say hanging out of church I'll go talk to them my wife does the same thing without me asking her to she'll go and text them call them try to see where where they've been and I'll do the same thing what what are we doing we don't want to see one get away we're not indiff to that but but you want people to want to be in the house of God I'm not going to stand up here and preach at you every time about coming to church I just want this to be such a Powerhouse of God's spirit that people would be so so upset if they missed the service because it was so much fun to be in the house of God you say could that be that way yes it was just so much there was so much power so much word preached there was so much it was just so good to be in the presence of God that we just wanted to be there that's the way we want it to be but he said if you can he said stay together and if you can add more to it constantly empty pews never inspired anybody if you can more to it all the time but stay together don't let anybody get away we're going to take all of them we don't want one hoof Left Behind brother brand said when the those Africans were in one mind one Accord and he said the the ladies he didn't have to preach to them about dress but they covered themselves they were naked they covered themselves though they never heard it preach because they got born again and because they were in one mind one Accord and brother brand tells a story about them singing together and and congregational singing is just that we're we're supposed to lift our voices together and brother B talks about the Africans singing together he said and they sung Heavenly sunshine I think was the song he said and when they sung together he said brother bosor said I've trained choirs he said but I watched him Afric singing in different languages he said but they were all in the same key they were all he said singing the same octave the same pitch why they were in one Accord they were there for one purpose a little while before that they were Waring with one another picking up clubs and Spears and fighting with one another like people do in churches they were fussing and fighting and and killing one another and they come together in the meetings they sang to brother brandom and brother Bosworth and he said it he said it was just like an Angelic choir no other mus music like that I wonder it made him feel good cuz he saw they were together I wonder how God feels when he hears his children begin to worship it may not be a bunch of them it may be just Paul and Silas in the jail cell but they begin to lift their hands to him and say Lord I love you I I thank you for saving me thank you for keeping me thank you for being who you are and when he hears it he hears two voices in unison all of a sudden he hears three he hears four he hears five what that must mean to him because his heart longs to see that that's why he moves when he sees one heart and one Accord you want to move the mind of God you want to you want to see him move in our services come in one mind forget all your differences and let God move among us could we do that tonight let's just stand together oh my oh I want to see God move don't you I don't want to see a service go by and it just be we went through the motions I want to see God move every time
