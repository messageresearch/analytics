[58:13] battle
[58:14] until that last one comes in uh thank
[58:16] you for praying for us while we were
[58:18] over there and we're going to have this
[58:20] service these services i just want you
[58:22] to keep coming if you can come to all of
[58:25] the services that would be wonderful if
[58:27] you could just make it to one make it to
[58:28] one but if you can keep coming on
[58:30] saturday night we're going to have a
[58:32] prayer line
[58:33] and i want to invite all of our local
[58:35] ministers and our
[58:37] pastors and things to come and be a part
[58:39] of that so if you've got maybe a chronic
[58:41] condition something that's not an
[58:42] emergency and you're just holding that
[58:44] in your heart and say well i need
[58:46] healing in my body i believe the
[58:47] atmosphere will be right and brother
[58:49] whether andrew will be preaching that
[58:51] night the lord willing and i just think
[58:53] the lord will just move in that
[58:55] direction so hold that if you will until
[58:57] saturday night and come to the prayer
[58:59] line and we saw that in egypt the people
[59:00] that passed through were just
[59:02] miraculously healed and it's not a man
[59:05] that does that but god is here
[59:07] to heal those that have need up and they
[59:09] said they'll lay hands on the sick and
[59:10] they shall recover
[59:12] so we want to invite you to come to that

[1:11:53] these meetings tonight let's just join

[1:11:57] come heavenly father
[1:11:59] lord as we gather here tonight on the
[1:12:01] first night of these meetings
[1:12:03] lord as i stepped into the sanctuary
[1:12:05] lord my mind couldn't help but go back
[1:12:07] to when your prophet talked about that
[1:12:09] day
[1:12:10] that you come riding into town and he
[1:12:12] said the air was charged with
[1:12:13] expectation
[1:12:15] for lord the believers were there under
[1:12:17] expectation of god fulfilling the
[1:12:19] promise of his word
[1:12:21] and lord as i stepped into this building
[1:12:23] tonight i feel that same charge of
[1:12:25] expectation
[1:12:26] in the hearts of your believers tonight
[1:12:28] god lord we've not gathered here to see
[1:12:31] a man or to hear a man's idea or to feed
[1:12:33] from a personality the lord we've
[1:12:36] gathered here tonight because there is a
[1:12:38] deep calling to the deep and lord there
[1:12:40] is a need to respond to that call and
[1:12:42] father as the believers have given here
[1:12:44] and they have their hands laid upon one
[1:12:46] another lord we know with unity that we
[1:12:48] can take the land we can pursue the
[1:12:50] enemy but father where there is division
[1:12:53] the house cannot stand but it will fall
[1:12:55] but lord we're so thankful tonight that
[1:12:57] we're not divided but we're united under
[1:12:59] the message of the hour lord we've got a
[1:13:02] direction and it's not to the left or to
[1:13:04] the right to the back but it's to the
[1:13:05] four lord or to possess our inheritance
[1:13:08] to possess our promises now god i pray
[1:13:11] tonight as we join our faith together
[1:13:13] lord may you drive out every spirit in
[1:13:15] this building that's unlike the holy
[1:13:17] spirit lord may your anointing open up
[1:13:19] and rain down in this meeting father or
[1:13:22] from the first night to the final
[1:13:23] service dear god or may there not be one
[1:13:26] service that we would invite you to come
[1:13:28] to that we would not make you welcome
[1:13:30] but may we make you welcome may you be
[1:13:32] the honored guest among us lord father
[1:13:34] for every church that's represented here
[1:13:36] i pray that you would bless them lord
[1:13:38] for every pastor that's represented here
[1:13:40] our brother matt tonight god may you
[1:13:42] bless him and his assembly lord the
[1:13:44] different churches it's your father from
[1:13:46] brother jason's in different areas oh
[1:13:48] god i pray that you would bless them
[1:13:50] lord father may we be refreshed in your
[1:13:52] presence lord and we'll be sure to give
[1:13:55] you all the praise all the honor and all
[1:13:57] the glory for to the wonderful name of
[1:13:59] our lord and savior jesus christ we pray
[1:14:02] and all the believers says
[1:14:04] amen amen the book of genesis the first
[1:14:07] chapter
[1:14:08] and i want to look in the very first
[1:14:10] verse of genesis 1.
[1:14:12] the bible says in the beginning
[1:14:15] god created the heaven and the earth
[1:14:18] and the earth was without form and void
[1:14:22] and darkness was upon the face of the
[1:14:24] deep
[1:14:25] i love this next line
[1:14:27] and the spirit of god moved
[1:14:29] upon the face of the waters brotherhood
[1:14:31] says waters is a type of people
[1:14:34] so we can actually say in the spirit of
[1:14:36] god moved upon the people
[1:14:38] the spirit of god moved upon the face of
[1:14:41] the waters i also want to look at one
[1:14:43] other place the book of matthew the 18th
[1:14:45] chapter
[1:14:46] i know
[1:14:47] you here tonight as bible believers
[1:14:49] could repeat this verse from heart
[1:14:51] but i just want to pull it here matthew
[1:14:53] 18
[1:14:54] and verse number 20
[1:14:56] matthew 18
[1:14:58] and verse number 20 i was actually
[1:14:59] reading in the back and realized that
[1:15:01] this verse is actually speaking to
[1:15:03] worshipers so how many worshipers do we
[1:15:05] have here today
[1:15:07] he said here in the 20th verse
[1:15:09] for where two or three are gathered
[1:15:11] together in my name
[1:15:13] there am i
[1:15:15] in the midst of them
[1:15:17] where two or three are gathered together
[1:15:19] in my name
[1:15:21] there am i that's the i am there am i
[1:15:24] in the midst of them we ask the lord
[1:15:27] this evening to add the blessing to the
[1:15:29] reading of his word as you i can be
[1:15:31] seated here this afternoon from those
[1:15:33] passages of scripture for just a few
[1:15:35] moments if i may if i take a title
[1:15:37] tonight i want to speak to you on
[1:15:38] welcoming a move of god
[1:15:41] welcoming a move of god i i believe
[1:15:43] tonight that we have come here on the
[1:15:45] first night of these meetings and meant
[1:15:47] to welcome the spirit of god into the
[1:15:49] midst of his church and you know a few
[1:15:51] days ago in prayer something just come
[1:15:53] to my heart that i've been thinking upon
[1:15:55] and it just struck my heart in prayer
[1:15:57] that what we think we need is one thing
[1:16:00] amen but what god knows we need is
[1:16:02] another what we think we need is one
[1:16:04] thing but what god knows we need is
[1:16:07] another now amen you may be here tonight
[1:16:09] thinking that you need this or thinking
[1:16:10] that you need that or thinking you need
[1:16:12] something else amen but thank god
[1:16:14] tonight that we know under the spirit of
[1:16:17] god that he is the god that knows
[1:16:18] everything about us and he knows what we
[1:16:21] need and i'll say it to you like this
[1:16:23] amen what we need is a move of god that
[1:16:26] comes from god and his word amen i find
[1:16:29] it like this the prophet of god will say
[1:16:30] in the message about 47 times he will
[1:16:33] use the term move of god and you'll find
[1:16:36] that it takes a power to start a move of
[1:16:38] god now we realize this amen that man
[1:16:41] cannot supply that power amen but god
[1:16:44] must supply the power in order to start
[1:16:46] a move of god in the message of blessed
[1:16:48] prophet he said a man cannot lay in the
[1:16:50] presence of god and a church cannot stay
[1:16:52] in the presence of god under repentance
[1:16:55] he said unless the holy spirit comes
[1:16:57] down and gives unction and power to
[1:17:00] start a move of god in there among those
[1:17:02] people amen i want to read that to you
[1:17:04] again a man cannot lay in the presence
[1:17:07] of god and a church cannot stay in the
[1:17:09] presence of god under repentance unless
[1:17:12] the holy spirit comes down and gives
[1:17:14] unction and power to start a move of god
[1:17:17] in there among those people now amen you
[1:17:19] all know as well as i know that many
[1:17:21] people actually fear a move of god and
[1:17:23] the reason that they fear a move of god
[1:17:25] is because many moves of god have been
[1:17:28] turned into fanaticism they've been
[1:17:30] turned into personalities they've been
[1:17:32] turned into man's agendas amen but just
[1:17:34] starting off this meeting let me remove
[1:17:36] all doubt and say and then god still
[1:17:39] moves
[1:17:40] regardless of what anybody else has done
[1:17:42] with the move of god amen god still
[1:17:45] moves i happen to believe amen that god
[1:17:47] still moves and sing and i happen to
[1:17:49] believe that god amen still moves in the
[1:17:51] preaching of his word i believe admit
[1:17:53] that god still moves in prayer lines i
[1:17:55] believe that god amen still moves in
[1:17:58] testimony services i happen to believe
[1:18:00] amen that god still moves and we might
[1:18:03] as well tell that devil tonight ain't
[1:18:05] that he can throw up every hindrance he
[1:18:06] wants to they've been but the spirit of
[1:18:08] god is greater at the church and then
[1:18:11] it's ever been before amen because we're
[1:18:13] not here upon a man's idea we're not
[1:18:16] here upon a man's agenda amen but we
[1:18:18] have come here under a spiritual
[1:18:20] leadership of the almighty god where he
[1:18:22] said if two or three would gather in my
[1:18:24] name amen i will come down and be in
[1:18:27] their list he said that i've got god on
[1:18:29] record tonight saying he meant that he's
[1:18:31] going to heal somebody here this weekend
[1:18:34] he's going to deliver somebody here this
[1:18:36] weekend he's going to give somebody the
[1:18:38] holy ghost amen i don't think we gotta
[1:18:40] back up to this devil i think it's time
[1:18:42] to break out of church hannity i think
[1:18:44] it's time to break out of cults and
[1:18:46] ideas and come back under the power of
[1:18:48] god and let the spirit of god free in
[1:18:50] the church ain't meant to move once
[1:18:52] again amen i'll tell you what if you'll
[1:18:54] repent of that thing that's between you
[1:18:55] and god right now in a few minutes it'll
[1:18:58] be in the sea of forgetfulness and
[1:19:00] you'll be full of the dynamics of god
[1:19:02] i'm going to church we're not in
[1:19:03] position to fail tonight we're in
[1:19:05] position for revival we're in position
[1:19:08] for a miracle we're in position to see
[1:19:10] the supernatural because god still moves
[1:19:13] amen i still believe god losing altar
[1:19:15] calls ain't been the problem god said
[1:19:17] their old fashion ain't meant they're
[1:19:19] out of style today amen but god still
[1:19:21] moves in amen whatever the devil says is
[1:19:24] out of style is what god still moves in
[1:19:27] whatever the devil says is an idea of
[1:19:30] the past is a reality of today and my
[1:19:32] god is not dead he's a living god here
[1:19:35] tonight he's not looking for your
[1:19:37] education he's looking for your soul
[1:19:39] he's not looking for your ability he's
[1:19:42] looking for somebody that'll surrender
[1:19:44] to it and let him come in the church and
[1:19:46] the power of his dynamics can you feel
[1:19:48] it amen the problem god said can you
[1:19:50] feel it he said can you feel it moving
[1:19:52] on you he said do you see what it is
[1:19:55] it's the holy ghost amen what you're
[1:19:57] feeling right now is not the words of a
[1:19:59] man it's the holy ghost of god amen and

[1:20:27] god the hour is here see oh i want to
[1:20:31] see him don't you how many wants to see

[1:20:35] see him and i believe we will see him
[1:20:38] amen because he is here now well i might
[1:20:41] as well go ahead and say what a prophet
[1:20:43] said he said my ministry is to declare
[1:20:46] him that he is here and that he is
[1:20:49] coming in a corporal body but he is here
[1:20:52] in the form of his word he is here to
[1:20:54] heal us he is here to bless us he is
[1:20:56] here to pray
[1:20:58] you may think i lost my mind but there's
[1:21:00] a charge in here that is coming from the
[1:21:02] word and there ain't no devil got enough
[1:21:05] power tonight ain't meant to stop my god
[1:21:07] from coming into the vessel of an empty
[1:21:09] soul he will fill you with his spirit he
[1:21:12] will charge you with his dynamics he
[1:21:14] said if you believe you will see him
[1:21:16] amen then you will see him because he's
[1:21:19] here now
[1:21:21] he said his power is moving he said what
[1:21:23] makes him people cry and shout and go on
[1:21:26] what's the matter it's the holy ghost
[1:21:28] they've been moving in them and you all
[1:21:31] know that there's three realms to god
[1:21:33] there's god above us there's god with us
[1:21:35] and then there's god in us do you
[1:21:37] realize what a prophet said he said
[1:21:39] we're not just moving because god is
[1:21:41] above us we're not just moving because
[1:21:43] god is holding us amen but we're moving
[1:21:46] because god is in us amen don't you see
[1:21:48] what this is this is the fulfillment of
[1:21:51] prophetic word that the move is home for
[1:21:54] the bride that's let's say the lord the
[1:21:56] move is not coming from the outside it's
[1:21:59] coming from the inside it's the holy
[1:22:01] ghost and fire and it's set up in our
[1:22:03] bones tonight and it's here to manifest
[1:22:06] itself the holy ghost is not just moving
[1:22:08] on you it's not just moving around you
[1:22:11] he said the holy ghost is moving in you
[1:22:13] if you can only realize and embrace him
[1:22:16] embrace the holy ghost and believe in
[1:22:19] him and hug him into your bosom and live
[1:22:22] right don't do nothing that would hinder
[1:22:24] him say lord jesus i want you i want you
[1:22:27] to stand by me here i'm going to stand
[1:22:29] by you he's pressing to get into you he
[1:22:33] wants in there
[1:22:35] actually what's inside of you how many
[1:22:38] will agree that the holy ghost won't
[1:22:39] send you tonight he said see what he's
[1:22:41] doing he is wooing to you he is wooing
[1:22:44] you to him all the time now how many can
[1:22:47] admit at times that you've been in
[1:22:49] services and you felt pressure you felt
[1:22:52] pressure on your soul you felt pressure
[1:22:54] around you and i say that every time you
[1:22:56] feel pressure it's not always in the
[1:22:58] negative because the prophet of god
[1:23:00] shows us amen he is more willing to do
[1:23:03] it than you are to receive it he said
[1:23:04] can you imagine brother bosworth
[1:23:06] expressing to this ocean out here piled
[1:23:09] up in one tube about two foot high or
[1:23:12] two foot across he said what a pressure
[1:23:14] there would be he meant trying to find
[1:23:16] one little crevice he meant to leak
[1:23:19] through he said now divide that by ten
[1:23:21] thousand times and you'll find the
[1:23:23] pressure of the holy spirit is trying to
[1:23:26] find that little crevice in the heart
[1:23:28] and then the true faith can leak into
[1:23:31] there and can heal you and then do you
[1:23:33] realize if you were a son or daughter of
[1:23:35] god you got a heart inside of you and
[1:23:38] inside of that heart is a crevice and
[1:23:40] that crevice was not put there to be
[1:23:42] full with the nomination it was not put
[1:23:45] there to be pulled away out of see you
[1:23:46] ain't been but that crevice was put in
[1:23:48] your heart that in the evening time when
[1:23:50] the spirit would be poured out according
[1:23:52] to joel the second chapter there would
[1:23:54] be a heart on earth to receive what he
[1:23:57] was pouring out come on friends if he
[1:23:59] pours his spirit in you it'll heal your
[1:24:01] body if he pours your spirit in you
[1:24:04] it'll save your soul if he pours his
[1:24:06] spirit in you it'll free your mind how
[1:24:08] many can say oh god let your spirit find
[1:24:11] the crevice in my heart on the first
[1:24:13] night of these meetings and let the
[1:24:15] faith of god leak into my heart and
[1:24:17] manifest the promise of his word he said
[1:24:20] see god's standing there like a great
[1:24:22] pressure don't be afraid of that he said
[1:24:24] because too many are he said you cannot
[1:24:27] exhaust god he wants to bless you look
[1:24:30] at somebody next to him say god wants to
[1:24:32] bless you you didn't know you just got
[1:24:33] me preached tonight amen brother danny
[1:24:35] god wants to bless you brother man god
[1:24:38] wants to bless you word of life god
[1:24:40] wants to bless you turn to the living
[1:24:42] god god didn't bring you together amen
[1:24:44] to condemn you and to beat you up amen
[1:24:47] that he called you together he meant to
[1:24:49] bless you with his shekinah glory he
[1:24:52] called you together to bless you with
[1:24:54] his anointing and to bless you with his
[1:24:56] power and to bless you with his love
[1:24:58] he wants to bless you he's ready he's
[1:25:01] pressing could you imagine taking all
[1:25:03] the water that's in the earth and the
[1:25:06] sea and piling it into one four-foot
[1:25:08] path and put it up there he said the
[1:25:10] pressure would be on the bottom of it
[1:25:13] he'd been trying to find a little
[1:25:14] crevice to leak its way through he said
[1:25:17] that's like the pressure of the holy
[1:25:19] spirit trying to come down on every life
[1:25:23] that what is moving you is the holy
[1:25:25] ghost see god is watching over his word
[1:25:28] to vindicate it because he has got to
[1:25:31] make it real he's got to make it act he
[1:25:34] said that's why you people are hungry
[1:25:37] for a revival
[1:25:40] just go ahead and help me preach for a
[1:25:41] second where is that hunger coming from
[1:25:43] tonight it's not coming because andrew
[1:25:45] plumber's here or any other preachers
[1:25:47] here it's because there's a spirit
[1:25:49] they've been there's pressing it's your
[1:25:50] soul there's a spirit that's moving at
[1:25:52] you and then there's a god who has come
[1:25:55] down to fill you with more than ideas
[1:25:57] and doctrines and creeds and dogmas he
[1:26:00] has come down to fill you with the very
[1:26:02] life of his own self he said see he come
[1:26:05] down to bless you amen he wants to bless
[1:26:07] you it's time for these things to be
[1:26:10] here if you ever believe me to know what
[1:26:12] i was talking about you accept that the
[1:26:15] hour is here now we'll preacher someday
[1:26:19] some hour but a vindicated prophet is
[1:26:21] filling the church the hour for god to
[1:26:24] bless the church whether being is not in
[1:26:26] the future it is right here present
[1:26:28] tonight
[1:26:30] yes sir the trouble of it is he said we
[1:26:32] got so many absolutes that we don't know
[1:26:35] what we're tied to he said we've got so
[1:26:37] many times one pulling this way and one
[1:26:39] pulling that way and one against the
[1:26:41] other he said how do the people know
[1:26:43] what to do he said that the pressure of
[1:26:45] the holy spirit coming down he'd been
[1:26:48] trying to find amen a place to move
[1:26:50] himself into that he can work word by
[1:26:53] word word by word amen then can i say to
[1:26:57] you tonight you are in position for the
[1:27:00] holy spirit to come into you and to
[1:27:02] manifest the promises of this word word
[1:27:05] by word by word then what you're feeling
[1:27:07] here tonight is the unseen force of the
[1:27:10] holy ghost now the problem of god said a
[1:27:12] doctor asked him one time they said
[1:27:14] billy don't you think that people that
[1:27:16] pentecostal people is just excited
[1:27:18] they're just nervous they're just
[1:27:20] screaming and hollering he said doctor
[1:27:22] you mean to tell me that her nerves can
[1:27:24] be excited without something to excite
[1:27:26] for him amen something has to excite
[1:27:29] them he said see that what it is it's
[1:27:31] the unseen force of the holy ghost
[1:27:36] it's the unseen force of the holy ghost
[1:27:39] moving among us and it excites that born
[1:27:42] against spirits let me just go ahead and
[1:27:44] say this i am done apologizing for being
[1:27:46] excited in the house of god i am done
[1:27:49] apologizing for worshiping my god i am
[1:27:52] done apologizing for being what god
[1:27:54] called me to me listen you didn't call
[1:27:56] me two years ago he called me from
[1:27:58] before the foundation of the world i
[1:28:00] don't just have representation in time
[1:28:03] i've got representation in eternity and
[1:28:06] the representation in eternity is a lot
[1:28:08] stronger than the representation in time
[1:28:11] i wasn't born to be a cold formal
[1:28:13] aristocratic stiff neck starchy church
[1:28:15] member i was born to be a son of god he
[1:28:18] was born to be a taunt of god he meant
[1:28:20] to manifest god in the power of his
[1:28:22] spirit in the age that you're living in
[1:28:25] amen i'll tell you this amen if
[1:28:26] something's not getting excited amen the
[1:28:29] spirit will not excite an unregenerated
[1:28:31] spirit
[1:28:33] the spirit will not excite an unborn
[1:28:35] against spirit but the spirit of god
[1:28:37] will excite a born-again spirit
[1:28:40] how can you be born again and not be
[1:28:42] excited about it
[1:28:44] well we might as well preach we're here
[1:28:46] how can some of us come out of the
[1:28:48] families we come out of and come out of
[1:28:50] the messes we come out of and come out
[1:28:52] the roads that we was on and the bars
[1:28:54] that you were sitting in and the
[1:28:55] churches you was bound under and god
[1:28:58] saved you and filled you with the holy
[1:28:59] ghost and revealed the greatest message
[1:29:02] that has ever hit the face of and we're
[1:29:04] not supposed to be excited i resent that
[1:29:06] devil in the name of jesus i am a son of
[1:29:09] god who has been born by the spirit of
[1:29:11] god i am a pre-born acts 2 son of god
[1:29:14] tongue talking message believer messiah
[1:29:16] preacher peter fire following son of god
[1:29:19] and there ain't no devil to back me off
[1:29:21] of it
[1:29:23] might as well clear that without the
[1:29:24] airways we've been born again by the
[1:29:26] spirit of god and we're excited about it
[1:29:31] we was on our way to hell but tonight
[1:29:33] we're on our way to heaven
[1:29:35] we was on our way to tribulation but
[1:29:38] because god rich and mercy revealed this
[1:29:40] message to us tonight we're on our way
[1:29:42] to the rapture
[1:29:44] it's the unseen force of the holy ghost
[1:29:47] he said it brings excitement to that
[1:29:49] spirit he said the power of god foams
[1:29:52] down through because faith cometh by
[1:29:55] hearing he said then the holy ghost
[1:29:57] takes the word and spreads it out over
[1:29:59] the people to catch it with the power
[1:30:02] that regenerated born again life he
[1:30:04] meant something has got to cry out if
[1:30:08] the spirit of god takes the word to a
[1:30:10] regenerated spirit in a son or daughter
[1:30:13] of god he said then something has got to
[1:30:16] cry out do you see that you're not the
[1:30:18] first one to feel the mood of god in the
[1:30:21] book of peter the bible says that the
[1:30:23] prophecy came not at old time by the
[1:30:25] will of men amen but holy men of god
[1:30:28] spake as they were moved somebody say
[1:30:31] moved as they were moved by the holy
[1:30:34] ghost he said we've tried to tell you
[1:30:36] the bible is the word of god it's wrote
[1:30:38] by god himself to the lips and
[1:30:41] instrumentality of man he said god can
[1:30:44] write himself god can speak himself god
[1:30:47] can do what he wants to but he chose man
[1:30:50] to do it because the man that wrote it
[1:30:52] is a part of god i don't have time to
[1:30:54] stop here but there's a beautiful thing
[1:30:56] land right there that if you ever was
[1:30:58] the son of god you always was the son of
[1:31:01] god see that those men who were writing
[1:31:03] about god was not writing about
[1:31:05] something that they were not a part of
[1:31:08] are you hearing me amen see the men
[1:31:10] wrote the bible he said now listen the
[1:31:12] men didn't even know what they were
[1:31:14] writing in their own human thinking they
[1:31:16] might have disagreed with it but they
[1:31:18] wrote it
[1:31:19] can you imagine you're sitting there
[1:31:21] writing they meant something and your
[1:31:23] own human thinking is disagreeing with
[1:31:25] what you're right and you pick up the
[1:31:27] pen to write something else and a spirit
[1:31:29] moves over you and makes you write
[1:31:32] something that disagrees with the very
[1:31:34] faults that you're thinking
[1:31:36] glory to god the spirit will make you
[1:31:38] agree with the word regardless of the
[1:31:41] way the flesh is feeling
[1:31:42] and then you think that paul wanted to
[1:31:44] write some of the things that he was
[1:31:45] writing but he was not in control of
[1:31:47] himself because he had welcomed the
[1:31:50] spirit of god amen listen to me tonight
[1:31:52] friends amen your flesh right now don't
[1:31:54] want to agree with the words you're here
[1:31:56] amen in your spirit may be so low right
[1:31:58] now it don't want to agree with the
[1:32:00] words you're hearing amen but i come
[1:32:01] here to tell you tonight amen that your
[1:32:03] soul is more stronger than your flesh
[1:32:06] it's more stronger than your spirit and
[1:32:08] if the spirit of god is in that soul you
[1:32:10] may be feeling defeated but when you
[1:32:12] hear the word say greater is he that is
[1:32:15] in you that he that is in the world he
[1:32:17] meant something will cry out because
[1:32:19] it's the spirit of god they've been
[1:32:21] moving upon that regenerated soul by the
[1:32:24] new birth he said men of old was moved
[1:32:26] by the holy ghost are you ready for this
[1:32:29] god moved their hands he moved their
[1:32:31] eyes in the missions they could say
[1:32:33] nothing but what they were looking at
[1:32:35] they could speak nothing because he had
[1:32:37] full control somebody say full control
[1:32:40] god had full control a finger amen of
[1:32:43] tongue of every organ of the body was in
[1:32:46] full sway with god no wonder the bible
[1:32:49] said they were gods he meant they were a
[1:32:52] part of god he was the fullness of god
[1:32:55] see that what it was it was the holy
[1:32:58] ghost taking control and moving in the
[1:33:01] body the pentagon said in the last days
[1:33:03] when the evening lights begin to shine
[1:33:05] eyes will become open and you will see
[1:33:08] where you are going amen that body is
[1:33:10] already formed listen if you're waiting
[1:33:13] for the forming of the body of jesus
[1:33:15] christ you're some 60 years too late
[1:33:18] because according to a prophet the body
[1:33:21] is already formed it is standing up on
[1:33:24] his feet it is taking motion it is
[1:33:26] moving by the holy spirit he said watch
[1:33:30] the same one that moved upon the
[1:33:31] prophets that wrote the bible is the
[1:33:33] same holy ghost that is moving in a body
[1:33:36] filled with the holy ghost moved in the
[1:33:39] holy ghost and it moved you out of every
[1:33:41] organization every kindred every tongue
[1:33:45] and every people come on friends don't
[1:33:47] you see what i'm preaching to you i'm
[1:33:49] telling you the move is home for the
[1:33:51] bride this is not a man's mood it's not
[1:33:54] a church's move it's not a preacher's
[1:33:56] move it's the move of almighty god and
[1:33:58] it's come down in this generation among
[1:34:01] the holy ghost moved in you to move you
[1:34:03] out of everything that was unlike the
[1:34:05] word to put you in possession to move
[1:34:08] you amen from time into eternity
[1:34:12] are you hear me it's the holy ghost
[1:34:14] moving it's not a man moving it's the
[1:34:17] holy ghost movement it's the holy ghost
[1:34:19] movement among the churches amen that is
[1:34:21] causing the people to hunger for reality
[1:34:25] it's moving in the church friends it's
[1:34:27] more than a man it's the reality of god
[1:34:29] do you realize if the holy ghost becomes
[1:34:31] a talk among the church the prophet of
[1:34:34] god said that will move the church to go
[1:34:36] to searching to go to hungarian to go to
[1:34:39] pulling for the realities of god i love
[1:34:41] these next words god is a reality
[1:34:46] how many believes god is a reality he
[1:34:48] said the gospel is a reality and can i
[1:34:51] tell you how god confirms his word he
[1:34:53] confirms it by his spirit he's been
[1:34:56] moving into humanity that has been born
[1:34:58] again by the spirit of god reverend said
[1:35:01] stay on the highway stay on the roadmap

[1:35:08] it to be the truth he said signs in the
[1:35:11] last days is god living in a man it's

[1:35:22] he said see god has to find somebody
[1:35:24] that he can trust somebody he can have
[1:35:27] confidence in that can have confidence
[1:35:29] in god a thing that can believe him do

[1:35:34] finds such a man he can put his
[1:35:36] confidence and his power in a man that
[1:35:38] will follow the road they'll stay right
[1:35:40] on the map they'll go right on till he
[1:35:43] comes to the place of power he said

[1:35:47] got faith in the word he'll lead him to
[1:35:50] power are you ready for this and power

[1:36:32] intelligence that has come down in the
[1:36:34] church in the last days to find somebody

[1:36:39] might as well preach i'm this close to
[1:36:41] it that devil don't want you to break
[1:36:42] through right now because he knows the
[1:36:44] potentials of this meeting he knows the
[1:36:47] potentials of what happens when
[1:36:48] believers get together and they begin to
[1:36:51] join their faith together the holy ghost
[1:36:53] comes down and the spirit starts moving
[1:36:55] that option starts coming and a revival
[1:36:58] breaks out oh i say tonight god fan the
[1:37:01] flames god move upon the
[1:37:05] i church brother and i'm a little bit
[1:37:06] scared this time amen it ain't wildfire
[1:37:09] it's holy ghost empire
[1:37:11] come on you know why god sent this
[1:37:13] message to you because he can trust you
[1:37:18] are you hearing me he can trust you he
[1:37:21] brought you to this now he said and it's
[1:37:24] a reality it's the reality of following
[1:37:27] the word
[1:37:29] do you see what it is it's the reality
[1:37:32] of following the truth amen see that the
[1:37:34] hunger for a move of god is a blessing
[1:37:37] to first for a move of god is a blessing
[1:37:40] the bible said blessed they wish to
[1:37:42] hunger and thirst after righteousness
[1:37:44] for they shall be filled that word
[1:37:46] hunger means to suffer it means to seek
[1:37:49] with eager and is higher that word first
[1:37:51] means of those who are said to thirst
[1:37:53] who painfully feel their want of and
[1:37:56] eagerly long for those things by which
[1:37:59] the soul is refreshed and supported and
[1:38:03] strengthened then tonight we're not
[1:38:05] thirsting for things that will satisfy
[1:38:07] the flesh or will satisfy the spirit
[1:38:10] amen but jesus in matthew 5 was speaking
[1:38:13] of the soul he said those people that
[1:38:15] hunger and thirst for things that will
[1:38:17] support the soul that will refresh the
[1:38:20] soul amen that will strengthen the soul
[1:38:22] amen will be filled with the desire of
[1:38:25] their heart the power of god sit down in
[1:38:27] their heart lord they want to see the
[1:38:29] move of god amen and those that find out
[1:38:32] the devil don't do one thing he will do
[1:38:34] another how many can witness to that if
[1:38:36] the devil doesn't do one thing he'll do
[1:38:38] something else and if he don't do
[1:38:40] something else he'll do another thing
[1:38:41] even the problem god told us what he's
[1:38:43] doing amen he's trying to mess up
[1:38:45] something or comment something amen and
[1:38:48] it makes them kindly pull back a little
[1:38:50] bit in an amazing right when the
[1:38:52] breakthrough is pissing to happen is
[1:38:54] when the devil tries to garb up
[1:38:55] something right when the breakthrough is
[1:38:57] fixing to happen is when the devil
[1:38:59] starts trying to cause some little ill
[1:39:00] feeling to come into the meeting but i
[1:39:02] want to tell that devil tonight we are
[1:39:04] not of those that draw back unto
[1:39:06] perdition we are of the seat of abraham
[1:39:09] and we will fight that therefore we will
[1:39:11] not bow our needs and no spirit and give
[1:39:14] this meeting to the devil amen this is
[1:39:16] not the devil's meaning this is not the
[1:39:18] devil's message this is not the devil's
[1:39:20] service this is our message our hour our
[1:39:23] season our anointing the holy ghost is
[1:39:25] here even to break forth upon the church

[1:39:34] place to find one if he wants to find
[1:39:37] somebody that is anointed to press
[1:39:39] through every obstacle that he throws
[1:39:41] against us we will press through and we
[1:39:43] will overcome because we feel the holy
[1:39:46] ghost moving in our soul

[1:42:37] almighty god you know what don don't
[1:42:38] mean brother ben was over brother baby's
[1:42:40] head was not a pillar of ice it was a
[1:42:43] pillow tire

[1:42:50] was a holy fire it was a fire to burn
[1:42:52] out sin it was a power to burn out
[1:42:54] unbelief but i want to tell you tonight

[1:43:06] fire it's here to break that whole spell
[1:43:08] it's here
[1:43:17] to manifest the promises of his word

[1:43:27] to hell where it comes from we're not
[1:43:29] under a pillar of our eyes we're under a
[1:43:31] pair of power
[1:43:32] [Applause]
[1:43:36] it's a move of god can i tell you what
[1:43:38] happens with the move of god it starts
[1:43:40] when god moves in his church comes into
[1:43:43] his church and proves
[1:43:45] that he is the same yesterday
[1:43:47] today
[1:43:48] and forever
[1:43:50] can i tell you what else and what god
[1:43:52] starts with it starts with people that
[1:43:54] settle to refuse for less than what god
[1:43:57] promised them
[1:43:59] [Music]
[1:44:00] testing it's still working it starts
[1:44:02] with people who refuse to settle for
[1:44:05] less
[1:44:07] than what god promised them
[1:44:09] they quit making bargains with the devil
[1:44:12] and get the full value of the full word
[1:44:15] in its full strength
[1:44:17] well i might as well preach amen you've
[1:44:19] been making deals with the devil and
[1:44:21] it's not going to work did it work last
[1:44:23] time did it work two years ago did it
[1:44:25] work 20 years ago amen that devil's a
[1:44:27] devil that breaks every deal he makes
[1:44:29] amen but my god said
[1:44:32] my god said all things are theirs they
[1:44:35] are the possessors of all things through
[1:44:38] the death of the son of god at calvary
[1:44:40] then come on tonight we're not going to
[1:44:42] be the heirs of salvation but right here
[1:44:44] tonight we are the heirs of salvation we
[1:44:47] are not going to be the heirs of
[1:44:49] raptured faith
[1:44:50] [Applause]
[1:44:51] hallelujah we are right now the heirs of
[1:44:55] laxing faith we're not moving into the
[1:44:57] message we are in the message as a
[1:45:00] matter of fact but it's all we are the
[1:45:02] message
[1:45:04] we're not going to be around the message
[1:45:06] we are the message
[1:45:10] i think what a move of god is a move of
[1:45:12] god is out of the routine
[1:45:14] i said the movement of god is out of the
[1:45:15] routine a mood of god is not ritualistic
[1:45:18] and it's not traditional a move of god
[1:45:21] is not theological
[1:45:23] can i say that right
[1:45:25] how do you say it
[1:45:26] theologically
[1:45:28] i graduated because of open book tests
[1:45:30] thank god for them
[1:45:32] a move of god is not a form
[1:45:35] it's not a ritual it's a fire
[1:45:37] it's an experience
[1:45:39] it's an action
[1:45:40] for the man it's a manifestation of god
[1:45:43] it's god coming in his church confirming
[1:45:45] the promise of his word you look in the
[1:45:47] book of john the ninth chapter sometime
[1:45:49] and you will find that in the days of
[1:45:51] jesus there was a move of god that got
[1:45:53] started with a young black boy
[1:45:56] a young blind boy started a move of god
[1:46:00] the bible said in john 9 29 we know that
[1:46:02] god's speaking to moses but as for this
[1:46:05] fellow we know not for which he is the
[1:46:07] man answered and said to them why herein
[1:46:10] is a marvelous thing that you know not
[1:46:13] from whence he is
[1:46:16] and yet he has opened mine eyes the
[1:46:19] problem of god said the blind boy is
[1:46:21] speaking to the spiritual leaders of the
[1:46:23] nation and here comes a man and opens my
[1:46:26] eyes by the power of god and yet you
[1:46:29] don't know nothing about it he said this
[1:46:31] is a marvelous thing he had something
[1:46:33] didn't he he did all right he did a man
[1:46:36] that could do this yet they didn't know
[1:46:38] which he was he said that was a
[1:46:41] marvelous thing one thing i love brother
[1:46:43] harold about about studying a prophet is
[1:46:46] he doesn't leave us in the past but he
[1:46:48] always turns the corner and brings us to
[1:46:50] the future and he takes his brother josh
[1:46:52] from john 9 to write here today and says
[1:46:55] now look today brethren we know we have
[1:46:59] a move of god
[1:47:00] [Applause]
[1:47:01] by the window we're not guessing we're
[1:47:03] not probing we're not presuming we know
[1:47:06] that we have a move of god he said we
[1:47:08] know it's performing miracles it's
[1:47:11] healing the sick it's raising the dead
[1:47:13] it's casting out devils it's speaking
[1:47:16] with tongues and interpretation it sends
[1:47:18] forth prophecies and they happen he
[1:47:20] showed his dreams perfect strictly this
[1:47:23] isn't a strange thing that the leaders
[1:47:25] would say we was a bunch of crazy people
[1:47:27] when the leaders of the nation or the
[1:47:29] churches he said that's a marvelous
[1:47:31] thing can i just go and say something to
[1:47:33] you if you're waiting on the white house
[1:47:35] to recognize the bride's revival before
[1:47:37] you act upon it you've done missed it
[1:47:40] [Applause]
[1:47:42] if you're waiting on putin to drop a
[1:47:44] bomb on america before you realize this
[1:47:46] message was the truth you're going to be
[1:47:48] a little bit too late amen but there is
[1:47:50] a people here tonight who is in position
[1:47:53] for another book of acts they are in
[1:47:55] position for another outpouring of the
[1:47:58] holy ghost entire come on what you see
[1:48:00] in a small measure while the headstone
[1:48:02] was descended you will see in the
[1:48:04] fullness of its power
[1:48:07] well someday somehow some neighbor to be
[1:48:09] in there's a super race coming someday
[1:48:11] there's a supersede coming someday

[1:48:15] this day this scripture is fulfilled you
[1:48:18] are the super race you are the supersede
[1:48:21] you receive the super sign you are a
[1:48:23] super race by the baptism of a holy
[1:48:26] ghost you're not going to be an
[1:48:28] invincible army you are an invincible
[1:48:30] army
[1:48:32] you're not going to be overcomers you
[1:48:34] are overcomers because you recognize we
[1:48:37] have received a move of god
[1:48:41] it's moving church
[1:48:42] [Music]
[1:48:43] [Applause]
[1:48:45] i tell you what a true move of god is
[1:48:47] it's a scriptural move
[1:48:50] you know why because jesus is very
[1:48:52] scriptural
[1:48:56] you won't find one move but what you can
[1:48:58] prove it by the scripture
[1:49:01] it's a preacher can you prove that i can
[1:49:03] it's in the book of john the fifth
[1:49:04] chapter jesus said search the scriptures
[1:49:08] for in them you think you have eternal
[1:49:10] life and they are they which testify of
[1:49:14] me
[1:49:14] remember i said let me give you a
[1:49:16] scripture first
[1:49:17] with what we do it must be scriptural
[1:49:20] it's got to be scriptural god won't
[1:49:22] honor nothing else see he only honors
[1:49:24] his word he promised my word will not
[1:49:27] return to me void it'll accomplish that
[1:49:30] which its purpose for
[1:49:32] he said and we see the word that's
[1:49:35] lauded today no matter how much unbelief
[1:49:38] rises in the camp
[1:49:40] and we got a quote to put the devil on
[1:49:42] the run no matter how much unbelief
[1:49:44] rises in the camp god will honor his
[1:49:47] word when he find faith to honor it by
[1:49:52] oh god
[1:49:53] god will honor his word when he finds
[1:49:55] faith to honor it by are you seeing
[1:49:57] where i'm at i'm in john the ninth
[1:49:59] chapter a little boy raised in the
[1:50:01] religious movement of the day amen and
[1:50:04] the religious leaders missed it they
[1:50:05] didn't recognize it but a little blind
[1:50:08] boy had faith
[1:50:10] he had a crevice brother david in his
[1:50:13] heart oh god i'm about to shout my
[1:50:16] shoehill's home he had a grandness in
[1:50:18] his heart and there was a pressure in
[1:50:20] the land that day that this man that was
[1:50:22] doing all these miracles was just a
[1:50:24] fanatic he was just an illegitimate
[1:50:26] child he was just a worked up emotional
[1:50:28] man but there was a pressure in the land
[1:50:31] that day there was a pressure that was
[1:50:33] moving in the land and it was looking
[1:50:35] for a heart that had a crevice in it
[1:50:37] that it could leak the faith of the
[1:50:39] promised word into and without one
[1:50:41] approval from a religious leader that
[1:50:43] god would come down and would vindicate
[1:50:46] the manifestation
[1:50:47] [Applause]
[1:50:48] don't you see who you are tonight you

[1:51:26] bible said when he came that the blind

[1:51:35] the boy knew he had been there

[2:06:31] you to luke the seventh chapter where
[2:06:33] there was a pharisee
[2:06:36] who was desiring jesus to sit in his
[2:06:38] table and have meat with him right and
[2:06:41] the bible says that simon the pharisee
[2:06:44] invited jesus brothers in other words he
[2:06:47] had a trick up his sleeve
[2:06:50] sister denise he had a he had a trick up
[2:06:53] his sleeve
[2:06:54] he was not that jesus to fix him with
[2:06:56] spaghetti dinner
[2:06:59] she fixes a good spaghetti dinner during
[2:07:00] turkey season
[2:07:03] he was not inviting jesus for dinner he
[2:07:05] was inviting brother joe to prove he was
[2:07:08] not a prophet
[2:07:09] oh god
[2:07:10] but the prophet of god said out of that
[2:07:12] comes a revelation
[2:07:14] are you hearing me
[2:07:15] listen this computer screen ain't
[2:07:17] nothing to me
[2:07:19] i was preaching to new york one time got
[2:07:21] to preach and hit the wrong button and
[2:07:22] turn fox news
[2:07:25] it's on
[2:07:25] same god let the computer scream be
[2:07:27] there
[2:07:28] are you hearing me
[2:07:30] but out of that come a revelation
[2:07:32] brother ben that jesus accepts all of
[2:07:35] his invitations
[2:07:37] the prophet said no matter who you are
[2:07:39] how rich you are how poor you are how
[2:07:42] bad off you are how well off he will
[2:07:44] come if you'll invite him
[2:07:47] come on word alive he'll come if you
[2:07:50] will invite him brother david he'll come
[2:07:52] and kill him
[2:07:53] sister mary he'll come right there where
[2:07:55] you're sitting if you'll just invite him
[2:07:58] you say preacher i don't know if he'll
[2:07:59] come the problem of god said he never
[2:08:01] turns down an invitation
[2:08:04] if you want jesus here just invite him
[2:08:07] he never turns down an invitation
[2:08:10] forever said he never has and he never
[2:08:12] will but i invite him on thursday nights
[2:08:15] i invite him on friday nights i invite
[2:08:18] him to be here on saturday morning i
[2:08:20] invite him to be
[2:08:28] [Applause]
[2:08:34] and turned it down remember said see but
[2:08:37] what happened was the pharisee had
[2:08:40] invited some celebrities too
[2:08:42] he said what happened was is jesus
[2:08:45] brother josh jesus come in their midst
[2:08:48] he'd come in their mess and they didn't
[2:08:51] even know he was there
[2:08:52] because they was too worried about the
[2:08:54] president that just showed up or the
[2:08:56] dignitary that just showed up probably
[2:08:58] said brother ben let jesus come in
[2:09:01] oh god
[2:09:03] can i preach brother daddy the brother
[2:09:05] said in those days there was people
[2:09:06] called footwash flunkies he said nobody
[2:09:10] got by the footwash funky heard him say
[2:09:12] today he said it's a mystery to me how
[2:09:14] jesus got by the footwash flunky
[2:09:18] come on now that footwash flunky had a
[2:09:21] job you don't let one person come in
[2:09:23] this house
[2:09:25] you know you don't let one person come
[2:09:28] in here but once you stop them and you
[2:09:30] wash their feet but that foot wash
[2:09:31] clunky was blinded because there was a
[2:09:33] greater miracle coming are you hearing
[2:09:36] me that foot was flunky somehow or
[2:09:38] another didn't see jesus when he come in
[2:09:40] and he went over and sit down in the
[2:09:42] corner
[2:09:44] can i say it like this he was blinded so
[2:09:46] that your eyes could see
[2:09:49] he was blinded so your eyes could see
[2:09:51] come on church had the footwash funky
[2:09:53] washed his feet we wouldn't have the
[2:09:55] rest of the story but because it was
[2:09:57] more than a service it was more than a
[2:09:59] july meeting it was a predestinated
[2:10:01] moment in the presence of god he flagged
[2:10:04] in the eyes of a footwash punky because
[2:10:06] there was a type of the bride coming in
[2:10:09] the house
[2:10:14] there was a greater type coming in
[2:10:16] oh god barbara said watch he come in and
[2:10:19] sit down he said i want you to catch
[2:10:21] something he said there's two parts he
[2:10:23] said there's inviting
[2:10:25] there's inviting but then there's
[2:10:27] welcoming
[2:10:29] there's inviting but then there's
[2:10:31] welcoming he said see when you invite
[2:10:33] look at this definition of the word
[2:10:34] invite can i have five minutes
[2:10:37] it means to make a polite or formal or
[2:10:40] friendly request to someone to go
[2:10:42] somewhere or to do something
[2:10:44] so we have invited you
[2:10:46] by the way of announcement to these

[2:11:47] possession of something to another
[2:11:50] let me read that to you again to really
[2:11:53] welcome something is to be glad to
[2:11:55] relinquish amen control or possession of
[2:11:58] something to another can i tell you
[2:12:00] something they invite jesus but when he
[2:12:03] shows up they say don't make them shout
[2:12:05] and don't preach too long and don't let
[2:12:07] him dance the eyes and just sit in the
[2:12:09] corner amen that's just invite him that
[2:12:11] if you want to make him welcome when he
[2:12:13] shows up and you feel his pressure in

[2:12:43] is invited but he only stays where he is
[2:12:45] made welcome wherever two or three are
[2:12:47] gathered together in my name there am i
[2:12:50] in the midst of them are you hear me the
[2:12:52] prophet said the church won't welcome
[2:12:54] christ they won't welcome christ amen
[2:12:56] can i ask you something who is christ
[2:13:00] brother man who is christ i'll tell you
[2:13:01] what the bible says the bible says
[2:13:04] christ is god he is the logos of god
[2:13:08] are you hearing me and let me slap
[2:13:09] another devil while i'm here you don't
[2:13:11] want people to be moved by the preaching
[2:13:14] of the word you ought to be ashamed of
[2:13:16] yourself
[2:13:18] you don't want people to respond when
[2:13:20] the word is preached you got to be
[2:13:21] ashamed of yourself you know why
[2:13:23] you know why because if i got up here
[2:13:25] and told you a sad story and i moved to
[2:13:28] my sad story to cry it'd be okay to cry
[2:13:30] and if i told you haha funny and it
[2:13:33] moves you to laugh it'd be okay to laugh
[2:13:35] amen then tell me how come i cannot
[2:13:37] stand under the creative power of the
[2:13:40] logos of almighty god and preach the
[2:13:42] inspired word listen my sermon is not
[2:13:45] coming from a man it's coming from the
[2:13:47] pinnacle that i'm under tonight i have
[2:13:50] become a microphone for the purifier
[2:13:52] that whatever is fooling you is not
[2:13:54] coming from and recover it's not coming
[2:13:56] from in the martian it's not coming from
[2:13:58] times it's coming from the pentaphile
[2:14:01] you know why because the moon is on for
[2:14:04] the rock
[2:14:07] that's just saying the lord
[2:14:12] who is christ
[2:14:14] he's the word
[2:14:16] he's the logos of god i'm trying to
[2:14:18] close right here remember christ is the
[2:14:20] word he's not the theology
[2:14:23] he's the word
[2:14:25] what else is christ brother jerome
[2:14:27] christ is the anointing
[2:14:32] give me some shout room up here brother
[2:14:34] matt christ
[2:14:36] is the anointing he said see the spirit
[2:14:40] that comes upon the word that quickens
[2:14:42] the word and makes it live see then he
[2:14:45] can anoint you for every blessing that's
[2:14:48] in the anointed word
[2:14:50] christ is the anointed word
[2:14:55] can i take oh god i'm trying to quit
[2:14:58] can i tell you austin what brother man
[2:15:00] was really saying when he said the
[2:15:01] unwelcome christ he was saying the
[2:15:04] unwelcomed
[2:15:06] anointing they want the word without the
[2:15:09] anointing they want church without
[2:15:11] anointing you know why because when the
[2:15:13] anointing comes in a meeting you no
[2:15:15] longer have control
[2:15:19] those gospel eyes will preach we're just
[2:15:21] close to it amen they didn't thought
[2:15:23] devils because men think they're going
[2:15:25] to control the anointing they've called
[2:15:27] the spirit of god and we're going to
[2:15:28] control the holy ghost we're going to
[2:15:30] control who shouts we're going to
[2:15:31] control who sins
[2:15:33] i'll tell you how that word should come
[2:15:34] from babylon it comes from the prince of
[2:15:37] hell and there's no room in the house of
[2:15:39] god for nicolette and leadership
[2:15:41] [Applause]
[2:15:45] i just bumped something but you all know
[2:15:46] me well enough to know how i'm right
[2:15:48] through it are you hearing me there's no
[2:15:50] room in the house of god for a man to
[2:15:53] try to control the holy ghost we got
[2:15:55] young people addicted to pornography we
[2:15:57] got young people leaving church and we
[2:15:59] got a bunch of plains police sitting in
[2:16:00] the house of god trying to control the
[2:16:02] anointing control the spirit of god but
[2:16:05] i say is there anybody here ready to
[2:16:07] welcome the anointing in this meeting
[2:16:09] are you ready to welcome the anointing
[2:16:11] you know what happens the bible says
[2:16:13] because of the anointing the yoke is
[2:16:16] destroyed the bible said the spirit of
[2:16:18] the lord is upon me he is anointed me he
[2:16:22] has equipped me as the messiah in an
[2:16:24] administrative office to manifest
[2:16:26] messiah's power
[2:16:28] [Applause]
[2:16:30] brother joe they don't want the
[2:16:31] anointing
[2:16:34] they don't want the anointing but we
[2:16:36] need it
[2:16:38] we've had enough unannoying singing
[2:16:41] come on i'm going to preach we've had
[2:16:43] enough unanointed preaching we've had
[2:16:45] enough men's ideas behind the pulpit
[2:16:48] restricting the sons and daughters of
[2:16:50] god i say away with that nonsense and
[2:16:53] uproot the anointing
[2:16:54] [Applause]
[2:16:57] [Music]
[2:17:00] a little psychology idea and we
[2:17:02] counseling a little bit and we wrote
[2:17:04] that thing off and they come right back
[2:17:05] you know why because the anointing don't
[2:17:07] break the anointed destroys
[2:17:11] testing one two it's still working i
[2:17:13] said the anointing don't break the
[2:17:15] anointing destroys i didn't come here
[2:17:18] just for a breakthrough i come here for
[2:17:20] a destroy through
[2:17:22] i come here for a destroyer i want to
[2:17:24] announce to that devil right now his
[2:17:26] scheme is destroyed his idea is
[2:17:28] destroyed and jesus christ the son of
[2:17:31] god
[2:17:32] now you know i'm telling you the truth
[2:17:34] you say preacher why don't you want that
[2:17:35] yolk broke because if that yolk is broke
[2:17:37] tonight you know what happens when
[2:17:39] something's broke
[2:17:41] there's a potential to repair it so you
[2:17:44] break it you take it to the store and
[2:17:46] they repair it but if they look at it
[2:17:48] and they say it is destroyed
[2:17:53] it's beyond
[2:17:54] repairing it's beyond putting back
[2:17:56] together it's beyond counseling not
[2:17:59] together when the spirit of the lord
[2:18:01] comes in the building and the anointing
[2:18:02] breaks out upon the congregation it
[2:18:05] don't just break the oak it destroys the
[2:18:07] old well i speak to you in the name of
[2:18:09] the lord by the word of faith there's
[2:18:11] some yokes right now being destroyed in
[2:18:14] the house of god because the anointing
[2:18:17] has been welcomed is there any fathers
[2:18:19] want to welcome the anointing is there
[2:18:21] any mothers want to welcome the
[2:18:22] anointing is there any young people want
