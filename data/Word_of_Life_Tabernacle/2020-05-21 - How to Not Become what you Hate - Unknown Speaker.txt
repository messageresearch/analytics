battling in their life we pray in Jesus name you love the Lord tonight aren't you glad for mercy such a blessing and I enjoyed the song service so much tonight it truly is a blessing to know that mercy rewrote our life we're gonna read from job chapter 3 and verse 25 job chapter 3 and verse 25 thank you for being here tonight it's good to see all of you in the house of the Lord and and many others that are watching today is our 14th anniversary I think that's right my wife and I was 14th wedding anniversary so I wanted to make note of that and it's a great thing in life and God gave me a wife that would put up with me and I'm convinced but Alan there's not another woman in the world that would have done that for 14 years and so she's been right behind me and in my life has been devoted to the ministry in whatever way that we could and and and that's what we've tried to do and she's put up with that from the first day that we got married she understood that that's the way that was gonna be in and she's always been right there with me and you can't ask for more than that amen and so I'm glad to be married to my wife I sure married up for sure in job chapter 3 and verse 25 for the thing which I greatly feared has come upon me that which I was afraid of has come unto me I pray the Lord would add his blessing to the word you may be seated this evening I a little bit nervous about this because this is an odd subject for me but it comes from my heart and these this thought came to me and and I just couldn't get away from it and I want to title this how to not become what you hate how to not become what you hate because this is something that is very personal to me that I've had to deal with in my life and I think that maybe most of us have had to deal with this at some point in time one of the paradoxes of life is that the things that you are exposed to enough to hate or to fear are the very things that you are most likely to become does that make sense you're you're around something enough that you don't like it you know you don't like it but the Caleb it's it's something that maybe some way that you were raised and maybe maybe not that maybe something you were around a certain type of church or certain kind of people or maybe you come up in someone you knew was a liar and someone you knew was a thief someone you knew was in some other way and and if it was close enough to you you learn to hate that you learn to dislike it you you don't hate the person but you you hate the thing that they become and the things that they do and if we're not careful though longer we stare at that the more we deal with that the more that we we fight it the more we're willing to use whatever means necessary to overcome it and sometimes in battle and in fighting these things in our lives we we war so much whether on against something that's going on or that's happened in our past that we overcompensate to the point where we be willing to do anything and we would do almost any means and the truth is when it comes to the gospel when it comes to our Christian walk the means are never justified by the end and so it has to be a that we can't bring the gospel out of a fear or out of terror or out of something that is impure in our life the gospel has to come from a place of love even if we're fighting something we hate and so I've found that people that become focused so much on one thing that they get that one thing in their mind and this is especially true as I said it's very personal for me because as a minister you tend but the day you get so focused on one thing you hate that and you don't want to ever become that and so you preach at it you preach at it you preach at it if you're not careful you become what you preach because you stared at it so much you know all about it and you know that's true if you had a dad and most of us did and you know there's things about your dad if you'd be honest that you'd say I don't want to be like that no matter how much of a saint your dad was and how great that he was you grew up and and probably true of your mom as well but especially it seems like our dads that we say I just don't want to be like that I don't I don't want to do that in my life and so you try to go a different direction and if you're not careful you overcompensate to the point where you you can't drive down the middle of the road you're constantly watching that ditch and you try so hard to stay out of the ditch that you go in the other ditch and you end up just as bad off as you were and you become what you hate you see some of these are so bitter and so awful and you just can't stand the way that they are and you end up becoming what they are as a reaction what you focus on the most is what you become and I think we need to be careful that we focus on the word we focus on the face of Jesus Christ that we that we keep from looking at everything else around us and saying well I hate what this world has become I hate what the coronavirus has done I hate what the Democrats are doing or the Republicans are doing is something else we have to stay focused enough that we can see what is your word say and brother branham talks about this this verse in Jobin he says in the book of Job it says here job feared and what he feared it actually happened he said what brought it his fear that's what made it happen that's interesting isn't it that's what made it happen his faith would have kept him from it but his fear brought it to him he was scared it was going to happen and it did happen and I love the way puts this he said now if he knew it wouldn't happen it wouldn't happen if he'd have been confident in other words said it wouldn't happen and then it wouldn't happen but he said the thing which I feared come upon me and brother branham uses it and another illustration said enough you take woman shall maybe be married she and her husband she's scared she isn't going to have a baby she wants one she's so scared she won't have it she won't and I've seen this many times she's so scared she won't have it she won't because just like Joel said the things that I feared the most come upon me see but you take that same woman he said now he said if there's doctors was probably sitting by nurses you take that same woman let her adopt a baby she'll have one herself see it quietens her no he said if you haven't got enough faith he's speaking of healing he said if you haven't got enough faith to receive it right now is a miracle then takes the adopted baby attitude who or it it's mine because you promised it I'll go from here tonight praising you just the same as if I was well he said watch what happens you'll receive it it has to happen God promised it amen but why does that happen because he quietens us it's it when we when we know it's going to happen then it happens and when we know it that it won't happen it doesn't so we tend to come back to the things that we were there's a very graphic scripture in proverbs chapter 26 and verse 11 it says as a dog returned it to his vomit so a fool returned it to his falling it just keeps going back in Peter that he quotes sad and he says dog - it's vomited a sound - its waller they just keep going back to what they were and how many times do you see that that someone will come from sin and you think and they hate that but then they go right back to it again and actually become again what they hate or become again what they preached about against now and again I said this is personal because it's directed at me because I want to be careful about that because it's so easy to go off on a tangent and just strike it something so much that you actually become just like what you're striking at now but the Bram talks about the early Pentecost he said come out of the denomination's he said that was Kirstin word to you the nominations they didn't want anything to do with it and just a few years later they started forming denominations and you think how did they go from that first Church say we don't want nothing to do with that but the curtains nothing at all and then here just a few years later here they're they're wanting it and they're forming it well it's because he said there's a dog goes to its vomitus out of their wall oh he went right back to the thing you were born to defeat I've seen it so many times with us preachers as I said that a preacher might recognize that a certain group has organizational tendencies and become so fearful of that and so focused on it that he orders those that he has influence over not to fellowship with those who have an organizational tendency not realizing that he himself has become an organization and and so it's it's a it's a reaction you want to protect what you have but listen it's not going to be up to me to protect the word it's up to God he fights for his word and it's up to me to preach the word to preach the word that's what I have to do and we have to live the word don't we we have to live the word but if we're not careful we we know what we're against but what are we for what are we for and I don't ever become known for what we're against and you say well message people well they're against shorthair on women and they're against pants on women and they're against a worldly music and they're against drugs they're against alcohol and all these things yes we are but that's not what we are we're for healing we're for grace were for salvation we're for going to it going to heaven go to a better country I'm looking forward to millennium I'm there's a lot of things that I'm for it's not just what I'm against now there's some things that as I went through this and just kind of bear with me because these are my own thoughts but I believe it compares with the scripture with the message but I've tried to put down some things as I said how to not become what you hate one way to not become what you hate is do not spend the rest of your life comparing yourself with people who you know are wrong you know that they're wrong there's no reason to go back and compare yourself with them right you come out of it for a reason there's no reason to just keep going back and watch and say well I got to do better than they do and you can you could use that with your parents or a church or anything else you keep going back to what you were thinking well they had their blessed life I need to be blessed like they are they got a new car I didn't need a new car like they do they do things a certain way we better do things that way no don't compare yourself with people you know we're wrong we'll never compare with the world will never compare with denominations there's some message churches will never compare with there's no reason to you know people run after folly they run after false doctrine they congregate everywhere you could set up a place if there's a guy on on television I've seen him sometimes when traveling and and he'll come on he's got miracle water I don't know if you've seen this guy or not but he's got water bottled up and then we did an investigation of this guy and he just getting water out of the tap he don't even have a church and he got an infomercial he sells just water to people 50 dollars or something like that for a little bottle of water and you take it and drink it in it's miracle water you got testimonies and things like that people flocked to stuff like that the man has made millions of dollars and yet you preach the truth and few people will come after him that's right but but we don't can't compare ourselves with that say well if I was as successful as he was well he's successful because people will follow that he doesn't require any kind of a Christian life or anything like that but there's a reason why the truth Strait is the gate and narrow is the way that leads to eternal life Galatians 5:26 of emulations this is one of the the works of the flesh emulations and emulations are in v's or emulation that is strife to excel at the expense of another strive to excel at the expense of another who oaring others to setup oneself unholy zeal fervently adopting a bad cause or supporting a good one by cruel means I said the means never are justified by the ends you might be able to keep someone in your church by cruel means you might be able to make someone toe the line by cruel means but it's never justified it's never justified inquisitions pretending to support true religion by torturing and burning alive those who both profess and practice it it was Adam Clark's definition of that emulations brother branham but Perry green tells the testimony her brother branham read this and the brothers were all being competitive in different ways and preachers out on a hunting trip and round 2 were told by the Perry that was his testimony anyway about it that he read him Ephesians 5 to license 5:20 and he said that was a competition and that's what the word literally means competition strive to excel at the expense of one another but see we've got to recognize God is sovereign God knows what he's doing let's turn to Psalm 75 5 Psalm 75 and 5 he says lift not up your horn on high speak not with a stiff neck in other words don't don't constantly talk about what you have and how powerful you are or your position for promotion cometh either from the east or from the west or from the south but God is the judge he put us down one who set us up another and you look and say well that person has a better position than me it doesn't mean you serve God less it doesn't mean that you were in less it God puts up one sets down another promotion comes from God and so you might become jealous of someone that has a position or of influence but that person was set there by God God allowed them to be there and it says he says God put it down alone God as the judge he put it down one set us up another but like what he says in verse eight he said for in the hand of the Lord there's a cup and the wine is red and full of mixture and he pours out of the same but the dregs thereof all the wicked of the earth shall wring them out and drink them so he's saying God has a cup in his hand a cup of judgment a cup of judgment and in that hand he's saying to hear those that are wicked you see them here they they've done everything wrong and you compare yourself with them and say well I don't have a life like they do here I've tried to live for God I've tried to do the things that are right and here is this person that that's standing there and they're able to do whatever they want to do and get by with it I can't get by with nothing why because you're a son or daughter of God you don't let us get by with anything pretty bad it's just a good sign we're sons and daughters of God but here's someone else just gets by with whatever and seem like everybody's form and all the people fought to them and he said God why is my life why does it have to be this way well God has in his hand a cup of judgment and the cup is not mixed with water to dilute it but it's it's mixed with thee it's the strength of the wine or the strengths of the judgments and the dregs of it so that if you got the the dregs you would get the very worst of it the very worst of the cup is reserved for the wicked but it's in God's hands keep your eyes on good things David in Psalm 73 and 2 says this as well he says but as for me my feet were almost gone my step said well nice slipped you can go back and read the whole chapter maybe if you get time but it's a good thing to look at he said for I was envious at the foolish when I saw the prosperity of the wicked I know that there are people who think well if I didn't have to pay my ties I could be like him if I didn't have to go to church I could have fun like they do and we're talking about real things tonight you know you as just a young family I've for the RV I paid it that I thought this but I have thought this if I wasn't a preacher life would be a whole lot easier it really would be and sometimes but the hell you think what did I sign up for why I spent almost every weekend that's 14 years of marriage studying to preach and I think you know we have taken a lot out of our family and I'm not complaining about it but I have thought that thought I thought you know it would have been so much easier if I had just decided let me just put that off till I'm 40 til I'm financially secure and everything's the way it should be but God didn't want it that way and when you get thinking that way you get envious at the foolish because you see people your age doing much more than you were able to do and having much more than you have and he said I was envious at the foolish when I saw the prosperity of the wicked when I thought to know this it was too painful for me now I skip down to verse 16 he said when I thought to know this it was too painful for me until I went into the sanctuary of God this is a place where our eyes open up this is where we get understanding he said I went into the sanctuary have gone I went to church and then understood I their hint surely thou did set them in Slippery places that cast us them down into destruction you set them in Slippery places so he's saying that he understood that the very fact that they have what they have becomes a trap to them the very fact that they're able to do what they do in the very fact that they don't have the conscience that you have you wish you get by with lying like somebody else does you wish you could get by with living like somebody else does but you can't do it why your conscience won't let you that that's something inside of you keeps you hold you from doing that but what is it it's grace to you and you set them he said him slip replaces brother branham and the masterpiece speaks of this group of of the bride the preview of the bride and he talks about the ones at the end were kind of getting out of line and he says they was getting back trying their best was getting back he said just get in line he said because here's why they were getting out of line he said because they was looking out somewhere else watching about that church that just went out into chaos well look what that church is doing look at that worldly Church look what they're becoming you better be careful because when they did you know it's hard to focus if you're marching in a marching man on the beat of an the time and they're marching onward Christian soldiers it was hard for them to cope it's hard for them to focus on the bandleader it's hard for them to focus on the time and marching the way that they should while they're looking over here they got distracted by that other church and it could have been just comparing themselves thinking man were nothing like them thank God there were nothing like them someone said what the message was true everybody would believe it well tell that at the end of Jesus ministry nobody stood with him he went to the cross by himself but it was still the truth they men he was the truth brother Barrett said they were watching about that church that just went out into chaos he said but the front ones never but the back ones just two or three of them kind of stepped down a little bit to the right hand side look like was trying to get back in line as they went by it gives me great hope the way brother Branham tells that because he says that they were trying to get back in line why that's the real bright surreal bride there they may have gotten their focus off it gotten distracted but they're trying to get back in line the second thing that come to my mind is I thought about how to not become what you hate is you have to remember that almost everyone does some things right something or some things and it's okay to say that there it's right even if the person is wrong and that's something that Bella Branham taught us is is that you have to stay with the word and because a man could have a gift and it was a real gift and you could be best by it but be false at the bottom be false and be wrong but yet it could be a wonderful thing and it's okay to acknowledge that there's healing that takes place it's okay to acknowledge and people say well you know I said see sometimes this message people we don't want to give the Baptist's any credit or the Pentecostals any creditor the Methodists any credit you know but there's some things they do right and it's okay to acknowledge that but we don't leave the word we stay with the word they can do whatever they want to they can preach whatever they want to but we want to say it's close to the word as we can but the RAM says everybody infant baptism he said they can do whatever they want to he said but we like to stay close to the word we like to say just as close to the word as we can and so you have to remember and because that'll cause you problems because you'll think well they they have success they're doing good but you got to remember almost everyone does something right even as the saying is a blind squirrel will find a nut every now and then just even if it's by accident so and there's sometimes people who do many things wrong but they're more successful in certain areas than we are God does not count success but he does reward them for what they do right a person may do nothing right but pay their tithes nothing right but go to church well thank God they go to church thank God they pay their tithes them they may do nothing else right it's okay to acknowledge what they do right and injustice 47 you know God speaks to Cain and came with serpent seed he was never gonna do the right thing but God says if you do well shucks they'll not be accepted there's an odd thing to say to serpent seed they said if thou doest well shalt thou not be accepted he said I'll I'll acknowledge it have you bring the blood I'll acknowledge it you come i cabled it I'll acknowledge it you see people that'll go places and they won't rejoice with people and they won't Amen or do things that well these people are wrong so I'll just sit here no no they may be wrong but they could have something right and you could be more wrong in your in your desire to be right than they are hope you're staying with me I I know this is kind of a little bit different I saw Philip Pett had turned in on the online now I was good to see that and Philip if you're still watching I'm it's good to have you tonight and Philips in the army and so we glad glad that he was able to watch if only for a little while but you know there's things that we do we want to acknowledge that people are able to make good decisions we want to base our decisions on the word and you know our election is not based on just the reaction that we get or the blessings we get from God brother Branham said that God said that his love was elective love the proof of his love is election the proof of Abel and Cain the difference between Abel and Cain was not how God reacted but it was their revelation and that produced a reaction and God said if Cain if you did on the same thing I would have acknowledged you too but the difference was the election gave them revelation somehow without a Bible without anything else here Abel was able to the revelation that he needed god help us today but see God's love is elective love no matter what happened his love was proven truly by the fact they were chosen unto salvation God has chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth but the brem says he may commit you to death as he did Paul he may commit you to suffering as he did job that is his prerogative he is sovereign but it is all with the purpose if he did not have a purpose he would be the author of frustration and not a peace and so we get frustrated when you drive by you mean you may drive by my kids we're counting churches the other day on the way here and I think they got up to about 50 churches we drive by to come to church you think about that well you know there's here 49 others that we drove by why because we believe we we believe the truth we have the truth and and we love one another but you may drive by 100 churches but God is sovereign he chose you for that it doesn't make them any less but God chose you that God gave you revelation and God accepts what you offer amen now we find that many times what people do their things they do that are right but they tend to do the wrong things or put the focus on the wrong things and that's what the Pharisees did in Matthew 23 and 23 he says woe unto you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites for you paid tithes of mint and anise and cumin they paid tithes out of their spice rack so they would take the spices that they got and literally measure out 10% and give that to God now I don't think any of us are that diligent but that's what they would do but that's all they cared about god help us today and omitted the weightier matters of the law judgment mercy and faith these ought you to have done he says not to leave the other undone you did something right and Jesus even acknowledges to the Pharisees they did something right but they weren't right as I was thinking about this another thing was if you don't want to become what you what you hate you have to allow for the possibility that you could be wrong and I don't mean about the word the word is right a hundred times out of a hundred but my idea about the word may not be right you have to have the humility in life if you're gonna make you gotta have to have the humility to allow for the possibility you could be wrong why because God thinks differently than you do and he thinks differently than I do just because I'm behind the sacred desk doesn't mean that I have a better idea than my wife does I throw some of you but that's true it stops we have to have the humility to listen there was times when Moses wife had a better idea than he did God came looking for Moses and Moses wife had a better idea than he did and there's times that we've got to be willing to allow for the possibility that we could be wrong and I say in 55 and 80 God says for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways saith the Lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts so you can say it this way the word is never wrong but I am often wrong the word hasn't been wrong since it's been written but I've been wrong today are you with me now I've known people who were absolutely positive and excuse me I don't mean to offend you whatever side of this you fall on but but I've known people they were absolutely positive that brother Branham taught that if you celebrated Christmas you were going straight to hell and they were so sure that they were right that they found out that brother Branham had won and so they believed that his children had some house that somehow swindled him into it and that they did that against his wishes and as you think just think that through you have to think and I'm not mocking anybody but I just wanted to it's just an example or an illustration how we get ideas and you know they're it's a much greater slander to say that a minister doesn't have his house in order then to say that he has a Christmas tree so you're actually making brother branham worse then then what you would if you acknowledge that it was his idea I mean people just don't they don't think about things like that and it's because people they stake out a position and they're afraid to say that they're wrong because they lose face you know how you avoid that don't go out on that limb it's okay to believe something but make sure that it's based in something and if you don't have any basis for it it's okay to have an opinion but don't stake your life on it because we could be wrong there were things when I first started preaching that I could have absolutely stood on and really thought I knew about and I found out later we're wrong brother branham did that to Benjamin Franklin was perhaps the wisest man in the world in his age but he made a habit of when talking to people I made him a great great at diplomacy because he made a habit when talking to people of saying perhaps or it could be this is the way I see it rather than saying this is the way it is because he always went around the world assuming that there was somebody who knew more than he did I think we really need to assume that about God there's somebody who knows more than we do and we have to be willing to own up to them say the Lord I know that you know more than I do about this you know brother Branham exemplified this to us and I just want to go through a couple of things I know I'm going through this slowly but I won't take too much of your time tonight but brother Bentham says in questions and answers and I love the way brother random handles questions and answers because he qualifies his answers a lot of them he says this he said if I didn't answer to suits you why maybe I could be wrong he said but it's the best of my knowledge you see this is the best of my knowledge again he said he said there's only one thing left for this United States to do he said now remember this is william branham speaking this is my idea it's only presuming just looking at it in the natural standpoint which may be a million miles off I'm not speaking of this particular thing whether it's prophecy or not but just to let you know brother Branham the way he handled questions he said just looking at on the natural standpoint maybe a million miles off he said I do believe that right there he said in the money the love of money is the root of all evil I believe that right along in there we'll start the ball rolling now see that that's that's a wonderful idea and a wonderful thought but he said I could be wrong now again and he talks about people that color their hair and I've heard all entire sermons about this in my lifetime I'm sure you have too but it's amazing how much we presume to know that a prophet didn't know and brother Branham says sister dare he said I wouldn't know what to tell you so listen I can't say for women about that putting color hair I have no scripture against that I can only stay with the scripture and I will tell you this I believe a man needs to stand on his convictions there's things I want to allow my daughters to do that I don't have any scripture for but I don't let them do it because you see what it leads into and so I try to be very careful with with my daughters especially in with my son there's some things that there's no scripture for it but I don't allow him to do it because it's leading to something it's just what I would consider worldly but I can't tell them there's any scripture against it if they get old enough to have their own family they can decide for themselves and because that's my opinion now but the scripture says they have to have long hair and said after that he said I don't know where to go said see I don't know nothing about that he says again so now I'm just telling you this for me because I have no scripture to back this up the only thing I have for the ladies about their hair is to cut it now they want to wear it that's up to them about the pin curls actually he said I don't know what they are what that is either he said unless it's these things that look like close friends they stick in their hair he said about the only thing I know of he said in the links of the sleeves I think being a Christian God would tell you what to do about those things you see I believe as a Christian person you'd know about how to do that well he's putting a lot of it back on you in me putting a lot of it back on me I believe as a Christian person you'd know about how to do that he said I don't think God cuts any certain links or whatever it is close your decent look honorable and clean speaking about the sleeves he said I think that's all right he said don't you said now that's just my opinion now this is me see because I can't back nothing else up with the scripture I'm glad he was honest with us first Corinthians 82 says this if any man think that he knoweth anything he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know so well I know this we don't know nothing yet that he ought to know but if any man love God I want to be that one that love God somebody found guilty of anything let me be found guilty of loving God if any man love God the same is known of him it's one thing to know a thing if any man think that he knoweth anything but if any man love God the same is known of God that's who I want to be known by hey Ben amen as I was thinking through these things the next one that I began to think about was we have to avoid spiritualizing carnality and this is maybe a little bit complicated but what I'm saying is that there's things that we do that's just the flesh it's just us getting in the flesh there's so much of what you do as a minister that's just a flesh and trying to decide what to do you know there's things with decisions we have to make brother Branham talked about Abraham how either had to make decisions we have to make decisions as a church sometimes you just have to decide to do something when to have when have a business meeting you know when to our far apart to put the pews when to change something there's just things that you just have to decide and sometimes that decision is up to a pastor sometimes it's up to a trustee sometimes it's up to the entire church but you just have to decide it sometimes and we have to be careful about spiritualizing our carnality then we get mad about something and don't want it to be a certain way and so we come up with a spiritual reason why it shouldn't be that way or why it should be that way and the most common example of this that I've heard in my life and I am so sick of people using this to adjust to to actually qualify their abuse and that's Jesus using the whip and I know that brother Brandon talks about it I know it's in the scripture I know that Jesus did that but you know Jesus did that and did no sin and I want to see you pick up a whip and not sin with it when you go into the temple or me if I had gone into the temple I might have just got in the flesh a little bit Jesus did it and did no sin and there's times when you got to get rough and there's times but we should never use it as just an excuse for our abusive natures Jesus was completely justified in doing that but when a lie should curse the children but the brown said that wasn't the Spirit of Christ it wasn't the Spirit of Christ God honored that prophet but was not the Spirit of Christ Acts chapter 15 and verse 36 this is an example of something that's just a carnal disagreement it's just a disagreement and it's about how to do the work of the ministry and who to do it with in X 1536 some days after Paul said some days after Paul said it unto Barnabas let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the Lord and see how they do so they're going on a missionary trip to shore up the faith of those that have those new converts let's see they're doing and Barnabas determined to take with them John whose surname was Martin if you look at the nature of Barnabas Barnabas is always trying to help somebody so Barnabas was taking him along to try to help him because the last time he went with them he got what his mom and went home and so so Barnabas thought well it'll help him if we take him with us that was his nature some men are like that Paul is only taking him thinking about the work they have to do and he says last time he wanted mom and went home we haven't got no time for that so Paul thought it not good to take him with him who departed from them from pamphlet and went not with them to the work Marvis don't you understand the last time your nephew went with us fizz's nephew Barnabas his nephew the last time he went with us he left us what makes you think he'll stick it out this time and it says and the contention was so sharp between them that they departed asunder one from the other and Barnabas took mark and still to Cyprus which is Barnabas's home country and Balto Silas he took mark and went home he used to say you'll take your your Jackson go home or whatever and take your cards and go home you won't play no more take your ball and go home he took his his mark and went home and Paul chose Silas and departed being recommended by the Brethren unto the grace of God there's something interesting about this paragraph of Scripture that's there it's just there and it doesn't ever tell us who's right and who's wrong and the writer never attempts to tell us one way or the other who's right but later on we find that Paul comment' recommended the Brethren to receive mark and this is in Colossians 4 in 10 he said Aristarchus my fellow prisoner salute excuse Marcus as Mark sister's friend to Barnabas touching whom he received Commandments and becoming do you receive him so he is mentioned as being someone that they receive so we know he's traveling again on the ministry but not with Paul Barnabas is never mentioned in the scripture again we don't know what happened to it but if you go back and look if it wasn't for Barnabas Paul wouldn't have a ministry Barnabas is the one that first drags Paul out of the desert and brings him to the Apostles and starts his ministry because Barnabas believed in it and so later on Paul gets in prison and he gets in trouble and he doesn't have anybody standing with him he talks about all these for cooking in 2nd Timothy 4 and 11 and you would think the last person he would want with him is Mark because everybody else forsook him but somehow Paul has to begun to realize either something has changed with mark or something exchanged with Paul that Paul realizes that Mark is profitable because he says only Lucas with me take mark bring him with thee for he is profitable to me for the ministry I'm glad that Paul was honest about this but again if this had been us we would have made up some kind of excuse some kind of long dissertation on lie that Luke or why that mark was right or why that Paul was right and what the spiritual reason will oppose the messenger the age and these things and here's a reason for that and we'd fight about that but it's just the flesh and God allowed it to happen for a reason some things we just do just because it's just us and we don't need to make an excuse based on well it's some spiritual thing you know there's people you could never sit under listen to preach every day I know that there are probably hundreds of people out there that could never sit and listen to me preach service after service after service you just couldn't do it you just couldn't take it and there's other people that could and you take the same minister and people one person just can't do it it's just the flesh and that's why God didn't call just one man but he calls a pastor in every local church listen but the Brenham says he was going on y'all know the story I won't go into it but in standing in the gap he tells about how he wanted to go into the wilderness be a prophet stomp out with the Word of God he said I said I don't want to be that but I don't want to have to live like that I want to do something different now the Holy Spirit had spoke to him and told him you're going to be a bum if you continue on the way you're going you're going to be a bum and brother Brent says I don't want to be a bum he said but I was told that you'd called me to be a prophet I want to live in the wilderness like the Prophet and brother Bryan was very honest here he said but I was using my own excuse so I could hunt my own good how many times do we do that and try to justify what the spiritual means but in doing so we become just like what we hate listen the last one if we're don't want to become what we hate then we have to recognize why that God put difficult people in our lives and forgive those people because there's people who are placed in our lives just to be difficult there's at least one in every church I haven't found one here yet so don't think like that but there's at least one but David's gonna raise his hand volunteer but there's at least one and every church is just difficult and then in your life somewhere you know there's somebody that's just difficult to get along with and they're put there for a reason if you know the story of Hanna in 1st Samuel chapter 1 in verse 6 the Bible says she had an adversary that was the other wife I was her husband's other wife what shows you what a bad idea polygamy was God allowed it but see it was it was a bad idea and because there was always strife in the home in here she's constantly it's an adversary says her adversary provoked her sore for to make her fret because the Lord had shut up her wound and as he did so year by year when she went up to the house of the Lord so she provoked her therefore she wept and did not eat and if you know the rest of the story that's what got her to pray and she received from God and she had a child that boy was Samuel why because she had an adversary in her life sometimes you've got to have an average so you have to recognize why God puts difficult people in your life and be willing to forgive them for me who God made them my wife's forgiving me right now for lobster you gotta recognize God puts in there sometimes God put somebody difficult in the lighthouse God allows somebody difficult to be in the governor's office God allow somebody difficult in the church why God allows it we can't focus on that person you guess if you spend the rest of your life waiting on your adversary to apologize and make things right you're gonna live a miserable life if you make every decision just faced with tunnel vision well when they apologize I'm gonna keep doing this until they apologize I'm gonna keep up my guard I'm gonna keep doing oh forget about it forget about it walk away from it you don't want to be miserable you'll become worse than your adversaries you keep it up you become an adversary to someone else and not even recognize what you're doing to yourself you're ruining ministry you ruin your family you'll ruin everything around you because you're constantly attacking your adversary and your adversary was put there for a reason mark 11:25 says when you stand praying forgive if you have aught against any and this is not based on whether they make amends personal forgiveness is not based on whether a person asks for forgiveness now there is a forgiveness when it comes to the church as a corporate body that when someone continues to live in sin and Paul said don't don't be a partaker with them and things like that there's a forgiveness the church can given and it's held back from that person until they were fit as a body what have you bind in heaven and be bound on earth but as an individual you have to forgive that person as an individual you have there's times you've got to walk away from them there's times you've got to avoid them there's time there's no reason to hang out with what's causing you problems all the time there's times you just have to get away from it as I've said to people recently there's no reason to live life miserably why would we do that why would we just continue to live miserably and say well I can't help it but listen a lot of this is on us if you when you stand praying forgive if you have ought against any that your father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses listen when something bad happens to you so bad that you just can't seem to take it and you just can't seem to make it out of what you're doing remember when that horrible thing happens if you don't forgive that person you'll spend the rest of your life right there you'll never be able to move on but if you can forgive them whether they make it right or not you're gonna be okay you're gonna move on there's a big world out there there's a lot more people out there that that want to have fellowship with you that want to love you don't stay they're worried about that person that won't shake your hand you said on purpose because I know some of you I've tried so hard not to shake hands during this and it's been hard and I know I'm probably gonna offend some of you before it's over but I just I don't want to do that I want to try to be a good example but see you've got to forgive if you spend your whole life there that's you'll never get any farther oh god help us said that your father also which is in heaven may forgive you because you did things during the time that you were looking at what they did you did something as we said Sunday there was an offense against God and when you offend against God he will forgive your trespasses if you forgive others but if you do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses there's a story I'm closing a story brother Brennan tell us about some bike riders they were in a competition to win a new Schwinn bike and you've all heard the story they were going down this this long plank and each one of them would ride a little waist and they'd fall off and then ride and he looked down like this and they'd see the bottom they fall off they'd ride and they'd get worried about what was going on they'd fall off brother Brown said they talked to the young fellow that was able to ride all the way to the end he said here's where you make your mistake fellows you're all better riders than I am but you were looking here and it made you nervous to see you were trying to balance yourself and you fell off you fell off you've got to allow some play in the wheel one thing that brother have you taught me while I would say that stood out to me over the years is he would say staying in the middle of the road requires some play in the wheel if your will if you kept a wheel straight and never moved you would go off the road you've got to go a little this way a little this way and a little this way why doesn't just stay in the middle of the road because the roads not perfectly straight and life has its twists and turns you've got to be willing for there to be some play in the wheel you can't hate yourself because of something because you had to tune up a little bit you can't hate others because they had to tune up a little bit he says it made you nervous you trying to balance yourself and you fell off he said I never looked here at all I watched the end and kept steady I've seen passengers that got so worried about who come to church and didn't come to church on a given night that it almost destroyed their ministry you can't look at what's happening today that's right you can't look at what who comes and who doesn't in this service but look at the end church were going to a rapture I'd be glad for the day we don't have to use this church tomorrow but it won't be because some government entity comes and shuts us down it'll be because we went home but the member said before they could shut us up we'll go up hey Ben hey man you were trying to balance yourself you fell off he said I never looked here at all i watched the end and kept steady he said that's what we're to do don't look to these little things now did this one do this or that one do that watch the end and keep steady Christ is coming watch the end do we still believe that but the Helen said the other night that when he was young how that he anticipated the coming of the Lord every morning when he wake up so God help us to be like that today that every morning we get up and say Lord I believe today's today I want to live today like it was like it was the last day like Christ is coming watch the end just keep steady don't notice what's going on now people get so sidetracked by the coronavirus or what the government still don't what what the politics is doing watch the end we know what's happening at the end he didn't give us every detail in the middle but we know what's happening at the end watch what's going to go on out yonder at the end time he said when we're going to have to stand and give an account for our lives he says an astounding thing he said David wasn't watching that little old Benjamite throw dirt on him he was crippled in hell he never noticed him it's hard enough to notice somebody throwing rocks at you cursing you out but he said David never noticed it he wouldn't even let the guard cut his head off he said let him alone God told him to do that God told him to curse me let him alone for David knew that someday he was returning in power that binge about would have his time those dregs in the bottom of that cup or nasty you don't want to drink what's in the bottom of the cup of the judgment of God that's what the world's going to drink that person just gets to do whatever they want to do don't get your eyes on them don't become what you hate don't stare at the monster do you become the monster but look to Christ don't become a denomination because you hate denominations well we'll keep from becoming a denomination so we won't fellowship with nobody it's wrong god help us today we need to make sure that we keep our eyes on the goal lord help me to keep your my eyes on you and nothing else amen let's bow our heads together I hope it was some help to you tonight I know it's hard sometimes to to get across what the way the Lord laid it on my heart but I know the Holy Spirit is working in your heart as well give me something to say then he gave you something to hear Heavenly Father I pray Lord that you would just move it in our hearts now as we're here at the end of the service I pray that your spirit would just begin to go in and help us to examine our own lives and father were we've not done what we should or perhaps we've stared at something so long we just hate it maybe it's the way that our parents acted or someone else did something that was wrong and we've tried so hard to avoid that so long as we keep our eyes focused on what parents did or what some pastor did what some other church does what the world is doing we can't see you Lord it's impossible to stay in the middle of the road if we're just looking down all the time the Lord you said in your word that when it come to the end times and we see these things begin to come to pass you said look up look up because everything around us is just a distraction it's just noise we need to look up so we can see the coming of the Lord the Son of man revealed the word of our day that's living in our midst help us to look up Lord with the coronavirus all around us the world going crazy people scared out of their minds help us to look up lord help us not to become distracted by what everybody else does or things people think we don't have many people people think we're not a big church people think well we don't care what other people think we want you Lord we want to be focused on you help us so hard to be focused just on you until that end time comes or if we do that we'll stay on track you help us get back in line Lord if we've kind of fallen out of the way begin to look at what everybody else does oh they're wrong and they're wrong but God help us to be right they may do something right they may do something wrong we're not focused on what people do we're focused on you Lord we're set in under under the mystery heart of your coming hidden under wings the heart that's what the rapture is hidden away Lord in your presence becoming the word we're so grateful for that today I pray God that you just moving in our myths Lord I believe there's some purpose why you'd have me preach this so if it's just for me Lord I receive it and I pray that you'd move Lord in my life and then every one of our lives we pray in Jesus name Amen thank you lord thank you lord [Music] amen the Helen sing that now let's together think you are it everything [Music]

minister you hear him here is preaching in sin and it sounds like we're so hard against this because we love the people and God place that love and desire on our hearts to see that everybody would be
