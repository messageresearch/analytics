[41:22] called by election and God giving him
[41:25] the Covenant of Grace unconditionally
[41:27] he said you know when God makes a
[41:29] covenant with man man breaks his
[41:32] Covenant you make he said if you make a
[41:34] promise to God nine times out of 10
[41:36] you'll not do it he said when God made a
[41:39] covenant with man in the Garden of Eden
[41:41] this you do and if you do this there's
[41:43] an if in it there's an if in it he said
[41:46] man turned right back around and broke
[41:49] his Covenant with God as an important
[41:51] thing to understand about Mankind is
[41:54] that mankind will always do the wrong
[41:57] thing right and that's why we don't
[41:59] trust in the flesh because our flesh
[42:02] will always do the wrong thing and yet
[42:04] there's got to be something that
[42:06] controls and governs that flesh because
[42:09] we do believe in Holiness we believe
[42:11] that God wants us to be holy he wants us
[42:13] to be Godly in this world but how can we
[42:15] be that only by the spirit of God living
[42:18] within us because man always breaks his
[42:22] Covenant and he said God was determined
[42:25] to save man so instead of saying if he
[42:29] was no if to Abraham he said I have I
[42:34] have you see the Assurance you'll come
[42:38] to me in an old age other words he told
[42:40] Abraham what he would do his seed would
[42:42] sourn in a Strange Land and all of those
[42:44] things he said this is what's going to
[42:46] happen this is not what's going to
[42:48] happen if Abraham you do this and if
[42:51] Abraham you do that he said no I already
[42:53] know what Abraham will do don't you see
[42:55] he already knew oh my he already knew
[42:58] every step that Abraham would take and
[43:00] he overwhelmed Abraham by Grace and
[43:02] Faith and knowing that knowing that
[43:04] Abraham though in himself he he he would
[43:07] fail though in in his own flesh he would
[43:09] do the wrong thing and yet God would so
[43:11] overwhelm him by election and by love
[43:14] that he would end up in the right place
[43:16] anyway and I think we could say Amen to
[43:18] that today we've made many mistakes and
[43:20] yet we know that God didn't say if with
[43:23] us but he said you're going to be there
[43:26] and we got to have have that Assurance
[43:28] in our hearts and if we really have that
[43:30] Assurance it makes us love God with all
[43:32] of our hearts now watch he said not if
[43:35] you see the Assurance you'll come to me
[43:38] in an old age I've already settled it
[43:40] not if you'll do anything go read the
[43:42] scripture he never said If Abraham if he
[43:46] said I will make of you a great nation I
[43:49] will bless you I'll make your name a
[43:51] blessing listen he said he didn't say if
[43:53] he said no if to Abraham you see the
[43:55] Assurance you'll come to me at old age
[43:56] of already settled it not if you'll do
[43:58] anything I've already done it he said
[44:00] then it's got to be sure yeah he said
[44:03] not Abraham if you
[44:05] backslide or Abraham if you'll keep my
[44:08] word Abraham if you'll do this or you'll
[44:10] do that God said I've already done it
[44:14] that ought to make a Baptist
[44:16] shout I've already done it oh you say
[44:19] I'd like to be Abraham oh brother Braham
[44:21] if I had that Assurance then I would
[44:23] certainly rest perfectly quiet right you
[44:26] said why you've got the same assurance
[44:29] and the same Covenant the Covenant was
[44:32] not only to Abraham only but to his seed
[44:35] after him amen if you begin to see that
[44:38] he said then Divine Healing becomes
[44:41] easy right Divine Healing becomes easy
[44:44] any other promise that God has given
[44:46] becomes easy when you see that it's not
[44:49] you it's God he said God has given the
[44:53] promise so then you don't need to get
[44:55] Restless oh oh my you don't get Restless
[44:58] oh that's that's what I want to do I
[45:00] want to remain settled on the Promises
[45:02] of God and know it's going to happen I'm
[45:05] going to believe God see God was so sure
[45:09] of Abraham that he did not have a backup
[45:12] plan
[45:14] yeah right right there wasn't another
[45:17] Abraham in the wings waiting on so if
[45:20] Abraham don't work out I got another guy
[45:23] lot you can do it no there was already a
[45:24] purpose for lot right you know how when
[45:27] you do your your your your finances when
[45:30] you do your budget they tell you to give
[45:32] every dollar a
[45:33] purpose right and in God's economy they
[45:36] they say give it a purpose or it'll
[45:37] spend itself right you you won't know
[45:39] what happened to it so you give it a
[45:41] purpose in God's economy every bit of
[45:44] God's economy had a purpose lot had a
[45:47] purpose he already had a job he was a
[45:49] penny he couldn't be a quarter or silver
[45:52] dollar or a half dollar but Abraham was
[45:54] a silver dollar right and so they
[45:57] already were purposed out in God's mind
[45:59] and again that's hard for us to
[46:01] understand you say well what's the point
[46:02] of of even uh of even doing of even
[46:05] doing anything for God what's the point
[46:07] of effort well God knew who would make
[46:09] the effort God knew who would would do
[46:13] well God knew that Abraham would believe
[46:14] him and he called him and he actually
[46:17] put that faith in him to believe sir
[46:20] right it's all
[46:22] God now God was so sure of you you
[46:27] didn't have a backup
[46:28] plan do you know that right there's not
[46:32] some other group going to raise up and
[46:34] be the bride it's not going to be the
[46:36] message plus somebody else and that's
[46:39] why I don't like to hear a bunch of
[46:40] criticism and a bunch of a bunch of
[46:42] nonsense about the message people and
[46:43] say well the message people are so bad
[46:45] okay uh you know we're the ones that are
[46:47] going to do it that's right right we're
[46:50] it's got It's got to come from the
[46:52] message somewhere might as well be us it
[46:55] may not be everybody that claims to be a
[46:57] message believer but somebody that
[46:59] believes the message is going to go in a
[47:02] Rapture right somebody that has believes
[47:04] all the promises of God is going to go
[47:07] in a Rapture I see your sign back there
[47:08] somebody is going to believe God's word
[47:11] and stand for it in this hour oh I say
[47:13] let that be me you young people you
[47:15] ought to take that and say let it be me
[47:17] I'm going to be somebody who stands for
[47:19] God if all the other young ladies go
[47:22] into the world let me be one who stands
[47:24] if all the other young men go out in the
[47:26] world let me be one who stands for God
[47:28] who believes God somebody will do it
[47:32] somebody will and it won't be the one
[47:34] everybody thinks maybe maybe somebody
[47:36] out there that that's lost in sin hooked
[47:38] on drugs and everything else but if God
[47:40] calls them they'll come out of that
[47:42] place and come and live for God he's
[47:45] able to deliver he's able to save oh
[47:47] every one of us ought to realize that
[47:49] this morning I don't care what your
[47:51] pastors being if he's calling you listen
[47:53] to that
[47:54] call heed that call
[47:58] you see God didn't need to hear a
[48:00] voice you already
[48:02] knew God didn't need to be assured of
[48:05] Victory Abraham didn't have to go to God
[48:07] and say okay God you're going to be
[48:12] okay be calm God don't don't don't don't
[48:15] I'll be okay I I'll serve you God didn't
[48:18] fret on he wasn't
[48:21] worried Abraham needed to be
[48:24] sure right God was sure sure Abram
[48:28] needed to be
[48:29] sure God didn't need to hear a voice he
[48:32] didn't need to be served communion right
[48:35] oh my am he didn't need to make a
[48:37] sacrifice he didn't need a seal of
[48:40] circumcision right but Abraham
[48:43] did amen he didn't need to see the sign
[48:46] of the son of man but he provided those
[48:49] things for Abraham and he has provided
[48:52] those things for us
[48:56] right Genesis 15 verse1 after these
[48:59] things the word of the Lord came un
[49:01] Abram in a vision saying fear not Abram
[49:04] I am thy shield and thy exceeding great
[49:09] reward I am thy Shield brother B said if
[49:11] God is your Shield how is the devil
[49:14] going to hit
[49:16] you that's pretty good right there if
[49:19] God is your Shield how is the devil
[49:21] going to hit you that's a better Shield
[49:23] than a Roman Shield or a Greek Shield or
[49:25] an American Shield if God sir is your
[49:28] Shield how is the devil going to hit you
[49:31] I'm your shield and your exceeding great
[49:35] reward in other words he was saying I'm
[49:36] your protection and I'm your
[49:39] provision I'm Pro I'm providing for you
[49:42] and I'm going to protect you in what
[49:44] I've provided Genesis 15:2 Abraham said
[49:47] Lord God what wil thou give me now watch
[49:51] Abram is looking for
[49:53] Assurance and God gave it to him we're
[49:57] humans and I know many times people will
[50:00] ask now say why do we need to have
[50:02] meetings why why do we need to feel the
[50:04] presence of God why do I need to go to
[50:06] church why do I need a pastor why why do
[50:09] we need to hear the word preach why why
[50:12] if everything's already set in order why
[50:13] do we need these things if everything's
[50:16] the way it ought to be and and God's
[50:18] taking care of me and God's taking care
[50:19] of everything why do I need to feel the
[50:22] presence of God what's the point in
[50:24] shouting I heard a preacher say why
[50:25] would I ever Shout why would I ever do
[50:27] all that he said I already know the word
[50:29] well you might but some I'll say this
[50:33] we're human beings and somebody
[50:36] sometimes the human part of us needs to
[50:38] feel and know that God is there the soul
[50:42] is convinced but it's the spirit and the
[50:45] body that need to know God's still real
[50:47] we still need to see people healed we
[50:49] still need to PE see people saved we
[50:52] still need to feel the power of God in
[50:53] the church we still need God to move
[50:55] Among Us
[50:57] why is that human part that needs
[51:00] Assurance God you're still there oh
[51:03] don't you feel like that sometimes you
[51:04] get to where you yes you're relying on
[51:06] the word you know the word is there
[51:08] that's what your confidence is in but
[51:10] sometimes you need to know Lord I just
[51:12] need to hear from you I just need to
[51:14] know that you're still alive all
[51:17] right and Abram needed that he needed
[51:19] confirmation am you needed
[51:23] confirmation some of y'all fought Devils
[51:25] this week and you come to the house of
[51:26] God and you need
[51:28] confirmation not not me saying it but
[51:30] you need to feel the presence of God you
[51:33] need to see the pillar of fire if I
[51:34] could say it that way maybe you won't
[51:36] see it with these eyes but you'll see
[51:38] you'll see the Holy Spirit moving among
[51:40] the congregation and and it gives you a
[51:42] confidence in knowing that he's
[51:47] here God didn't need those things people
[51:50] say well I don't need it well good for
[51:51] you I
[51:55] do I'm glad glad you're above that but
[51:58] brother brandham wasn't Abraham
[52:03] wasn't Abram said Lord God what wil thou
[52:07] give me sir What wilt thou give me
[52:10] seeing I go childless and the steward of
[52:12] my house is this elaser of Damascus he
[52:15] said Lord it's hard for me to understand
[52:18] how you're going to make me a great
[52:20] nation and I don't even have any
[52:22] children right he needed confirmation
[52:25] and Abram said behold to me thou Hast
[52:28] given no seed and lo one born in my
[52:32] house is mine Heir so he's saying I look
[52:34] at the promise and I look at my current
[52:37] condition and I realize that my current
[52:39] condition doesn't match the promise I
[52:41] believe it will but how Lord would you
[52:45] confirm to me that you that you really
[52:47] mean what you say would you just please
[52:51] give me something I don't believe Abram
[52:53] was wrong to ask that I believe he was
[52:55] he was right where God wanted him to be
[52:57] he's admitting I'm human God I'm human
[53:00] and I've got great faith but I also know
[53:03] that I need a confirmation I need
[53:05] something that I can I can see to know
[53:08] that you're moving among me Among Us now
[53:11] you say well that's wrong that's just
[53:12] for unbelievers well there's never been
[53:15] go go look in the scripture there's
[53:16] never been a person who met God that
[53:19] didn't get some kind of
[53:21] confirmation that they met
[53:23] him right it never did work on just an
[53:26] intellect ual faith it never did work
[53:28] without some kind of confirmation that
[53:31] they'd met God and I'll say well you say
[53:33] well I'm not a very emotional person
[53:34] well you may not be but there's got to
[53:36] be some kind of confirmation there has
[53:38] to be some Supernatural in your life the
[53:40] fact if you've left the world and
[53:41] followed the gospel that's a
[53:43] supernatural
[53:44] thing right that's not a natural thing
[53:47] to do what you're doing it's not a
[53:49] natural thing to live like you live
[53:51] that's a supernatural thing there's got
[53:53] to be some element of Supernatural in
[53:55] your life or you're never going to make
[53:58] it because you're
[54:00] human right and we don't just live for
[54:03] the Lord in an abstract way right we
[54:06] live in a real way in a real world words
[54:09] we we have real hands and real feet and
[54:11] we walk in a real world and we have real
[54:13] marriages and we have we work in real
[54:15] jobs and we need a real
[54:18] God a God who comes down a God who helps
[54:22] us when we have a need a God who's there
[54:24] when we're have a sickness a God who we
[54:26] can feel and we can know sir brother BR
[54:28] said a Believer could feel God and know
[54:30] that he's there and I'm so thankful for
[54:34] that amen we don't put our confidence in
[54:37] feelings we don't put our trust in
[54:39] feelings but it's just a
[54:42] confirmation right a
[54:45] confirmation now he said and behold the
[54:49] word of the Lord came unto him saying
[54:51] this shall not be thine Heir but he that
[54:54] shall come forth out of thine own bowels
[54:56] shall be thine air he brought him forth
[54:59] abroad and said look now toward Heaven
[55:02] all right tell the stars all right if
[55:04] thou be able to number them Abram's
[55:07] looking up there and says one two
[55:10] three
[55:11] 500 5,000 10 million said I can't count
[55:16] them God that's the point
[55:19] right so shall your seed
[55:23] be and he said and he believed belied in
[55:26] the Lord and he counted it to him for
[55:30] righteousness he believed before it was
[55:33] confirmed but God was gracious to
[55:36] confirm the
[55:37] Covenant now Abraham belongs to God he
[55:40] believes God he's separated from his
[55:42] Kindred but now God is going to confirm
[55:44] his Covenant through the blood with the
[55:46] end result being the Seal of
[55:48] circumcision which is the type of the
[55:49] Holy Ghost and we know after the
[55:51] Covenant is confirmed in chapter 17
[55:54] Abram is changed to Abraham in chapter
[55:56] 18 he's visited by Elohim and Abraham
[55:59] and Sarah have their bodies changed back
[56:02] now brother BR said what he done to
[56:04] Abraham he did to his seed and we are
[56:07] his seed by faith Romans 4:1 what shall
[56:10] we say then that Abraham our father as
[56:12] pertaining to the flesh hath found for
[56:15] If Abraham were justified by works he
[56:17] hath where of to Glory but not before
[56:19] God other words who can go to God and
[56:21] say I did
[56:23] this right all of our righteousness is
[56:26] filthy rags before God he says if he was
[56:29] justified by works he has to where of to
[56:31] Glory but not before God he said for
[56:33] what sayith the scripture Abraham
[56:34] believed God and was counted unto him
[56:36] for righteousness now to him that
[56:38] worketh is a reward not reckoned of
[56:40] Grace but of debt other words we go to
[56:42] God and say God you owe me this God
[56:44] don't owe us nothing he gave us
[56:48] everything right but to him that worketh
[56:50] not but believeth on him that justifieth
[56:53] the ungodly his faith is counted for
[56:56] righteousness even as David also
[56:58] described the blessedness of the man
[57:00] unto whom God imputeth righteousness
[57:03] without works saying blessed are they
[57:06] whose iniquities are forgiven whose sins
[57:08] are covered blessed is the man to whom
[57:11] the Lord will not impute
[57:14] sin imputation is placing in an account
[57:18] it's not covering up so in other words
[57:21] it's not it's not an overdraft privilege
[57:24] it's not the bank ignoring the fact that
[57:26] you're
[57:27] overdrawn it's the bank putting money
[57:31] into the account so that you're not
[57:34] overdrawn God don't just leave you in
[57:37] your sin but he imputes righteousness to
[57:39] you by faith and then he makes you
[57:42] righteous he cleans you up as though you
[57:44] never did it in the first place and he
[57:46] makes you want to live for him and he
[57:48] makes you want to follow him and he put
[57:50] the spirit in you to love the word of
[57:52] God and love the people of God that's
[57:54] what God will do listen if that's never
[57:55] happen happen in your life you need to
[57:57] believe God with all your heart when you
[58:00] believe him with all of your heart like
[58:01] Abraham did and you do what God says you
[58:03] obey God's voice you hear the voice of
[58:06] God God will begin to confirm his
[58:08] Covenant in your
[58:11] life Paul argues that his Abraham's
[58:13] righteousness did not come from
[58:15] circumcision but from Faith because the
[58:19] uh the Jews put their confidence in the
[58:20] confirmation of circumcision and watch
[58:23] what he said cometh this blessing to
[58:24] stand upon the circumcision only or upon
[58:26] the uncircumcision also for we say that
[58:29] Faith was reckoned to Abraham for
[58:30] righteousness how was it then reckoned
[58:32] when he was in circumcision or in
[58:33] uncircumcision not in circumcision but
[58:36] in uncircumcision he received in other
[58:38] words he was a gentile at the time there
[58:40] was no such thing as a Jewish Nation he
[58:43] received the sign of circumcision a seal
[58:45] of the righteousness of the faith which
[58:47] he had yet being uncircumcised that he
[58:49] might be the father of all them that
[58:51] believe though they be not circumcised
[58:54] that righteousness might be imputed unto
[58:55] them also and the father of circumcision
[58:58] to them who are not of the circumcision
[59:00] only but who also walk in the steps of
[59:02] that Faith of Our Father Abraham which
[59:05] he had being yet uncircumcised walk in
[59:08] the steps of that Faith jump to verse 16
[59:11] therefore it is a faith that it might be
[59:14] by Grace with to the end or with the
[59:16] result listen that the promise might be
[59:20] sure yes sir to all the seed right it
[59:24] was already sure to God
[59:26] yeah he had no question about Abraham's
[59:30] ability to serve him but Abraham had the
[59:35] questions God never
[59:38] laughed but Abraham and Sarah
[59:41] laughed right God never doubted but
[59:45] Abraham and Sarah never doubted when you
[59:46] get the to the biography of Abraham's
[59:48] life it says he never never staggered at
[59:50] the promise of
[59:52] God right but but God never had any God
[59:55] had never had any need to come down and
[59:58] show Abraham these things but Abraham
[1:00:00] had that need amen oh my oh my it's not
[1:00:04] that God needs for us to to have a great
[1:00:07] Revival Among Us and got him moving
[1:00:09] among us but we need
[1:00:12] it amen now and I believe he loves
[1:00:16] it now watch this he said it's a faith
[1:00:20] to the end or with the result the
[1:00:21] promise might be sure to all the seed
[1:00:22] not to that only which is of the law but
[1:00:24] to that also which is of the faith of
[1:00:26] Abraham who is the father of us all it
[1:00:28] written I've made the father many
[1:00:29] nations before him whom he believed even
[1:00:32] God who quickeneth the dead and cth
[1:00:34] those things which be not as though they
[1:00:35] were now there had to be a supernatural
[1:00:38] event this is how God has chosen to work
[1:00:40] with Humanity that there would be a
[1:00:42] supernatural event to make the promise
[1:00:45] sure again not to God but to Abraham and
[1:00:48] his seed brother Bram says it this way
[1:00:51] early on in his ministry in 1953 he said
[1:00:54] the very phenomena of Sarah's womb being
[1:00:57] dead before Isaac come he said God just
[1:00:59] let it go on she was 60 years old when
[1:01:02] she got the promise she was 90 years old
[1:01:04] before the seed ever was conceived in
[1:01:06] her perfectly absolutely phenomenal
[1:01:09] phenomenal other words
[1:01:11] Supernatural right and the man that's
[1:01:13] born again is a
[1:01:15] phenomenal hallelujah it's not accepting
[1:01:18] or raising up your hand like this he
[1:01:20] said it's a gift of God
[1:01:23] phenomenal he said born again taken out
[1:01:25] of this this world in the realm of
[1:01:26] Senses yes sir why because you deserve
[1:01:29] it no because God promised it that the
[1:01:32] promise might be sure according to the
[1:01:36] election right so there's a time for
[1:01:38] raising your hand to accept Christ that
[1:01:40] that is effective and that you surrender
[1:01:43] to Christ there's a time uh to be
[1:01:45] baptized there's a time to do the works
[1:01:48] of of of repentance and and those things
[1:01:51] but there needs to be a supernatural
[1:01:53] birth to confirm your faith that you're
[1:01:56] a child of God because without that God
[1:01:59] knows but you don't
[1:02:01] know are you with me now God knew before
[1:02:04] you were ever born that you were a child
[1:02:06] of God but you don't know who you are
[1:02:09] until you receive his Spirit living
[1:02:11] inside of
[1:02:12] you right you can hope you can think you
[1:02:14] can press you can do all of that you can
[1:02:16] want to be but there's got to be a
[1:02:18] supernatural phenominal event right that
[1:02:22] takes place for you to be born
[1:02:24] again he said does that to be well will
[1:02:26] I shout will I run we don't know what
[1:02:29] you'll do but it'll be
[1:02:31] Supernatural and I'll say this again if
[1:02:34] you've come out of the world and
[1:02:35] something changed you and your desires
[1:02:37] have changed something supernatural has
[1:02:41] happened right so now's not a time to
[1:02:44] doubt Now's the Time to press forward
[1:02:47] whatever you have and I just tell people
[1:02:49] this they brother Ben I'm not sure if
[1:02:50] I've got it whatever you have hold on to
[1:02:52] that and want more Lord I want more I I
[1:02:55] want to filling of the Holy Ghost I want
[1:02:57] a phenomenal event in my life I want you
[1:02:59] to move in my life whatever I have now I
[1:03:02] want more of that I want something that
[1:03:04] keeps me I want something that takes a
[1:03:06] doubt away from me I want something that
[1:03:08] seals me to the day of my my uh my my
[1:03:11] going home I want something I want
[1:03:14] something that confirms my faith oh
[1:03:17] every one of us need to have our faith
[1:03:19] confirmed sometimes now look Genesis
[1:03:23] 15:7 he said unto him I am the Lord that
[1:03:25] brought the out of er the Calis to give
[1:03:28] thee this land to inherit it now notice
[1:03:29] what he asked he said Lord God whereby
[1:03:33] shall I know that I shall inherit it
[1:03:37] other words God I want to be
[1:03:40] sure I'm I know you called me I know
[1:03:44] you've led me I believe I'm a Believer
[1:03:47] but I want to be sure how will I know
[1:03:50] that I shall inherit it he said unto him
[1:03:52] take me in heer of three years old and
[1:03:55] she goat of 3 years old and a ram of
[1:03:58] three years old and a turtle dove and a
[1:04:00] young pigeon and he took unto him all
[1:04:03] these and divided them in the midst and
[1:04:05] laid each piece one one against another
[1:04:08] but the birds divided he not now brother
[1:04:09] bandham taught us that the sacrifices
[1:04:12] were divided and they were divided as a
[1:04:14] type and they were also divided to show
[1:04:16] the Old and New Testament they were
[1:04:18] divided in two pieces he said but the
[1:04:20] turtle dos were not divided because
[1:04:23] healing Divine Healing was a type of
[1:04:25] Divine Healing and Divine Healing he
[1:04:26] said was always by faith right it was in
[1:04:29] the Old Testament it is in the New
[1:04:31] Testament but in the Old Testament the
[1:04:33] way you accessed Grace was not just by
[1:04:37] believing it but by having a literal
[1:04:39] sacrifice and then believing in that
[1:04:42] right having faith in that and putting
[1:04:44] your hands on that being identified with
[1:04:46] that but it had to be a literal
[1:04:47] sacrifice we don't have a literal
[1:04:50] sacrifice what do we have we have the
[1:04:52] Lord Jesus Christ who died on the cross
[1:04:54] for our sins
[1:04:56] right so it's a it's a sacrifice once
[1:04:59] for all we don't have to go cut up a
[1:05:01] bunch of he goats and she goats and and
[1:05:04] heers right what are we doing we we just
[1:05:07] come to church and believe God and trust
[1:05:09] God but we have the Holy Spirit that
[1:05:11] comes back on us that shows us that that
[1:05:14] sacrifice was made and was made for us
[1:05:17] now uh brother BR said Divine Healing
[1:05:19] has always been by faith in the old New
[1:05:20] Testament there's a wonderful teaching
[1:05:22] there I don't have time to get into it
[1:05:23] this morning in Genesis 151
[1:05:26] it says now now he's divided the
[1:05:28] sacrifice now think about it for a
[1:05:30] minute Abraham's gone out there and done
[1:05:32] what God Said to
[1:05:33] do right and he's divided the sacrifices
[1:05:37] cut them in
[1:05:38] two and he's got half a hepher over here
[1:05:42] half a heer over there and half a ram
[1:05:45] over here and half a ram over here and
[1:05:48] half a she goat over here half of she
[1:05:49] got over there got them
[1:05:51] divided he says well now what do I
[1:05:54] do well the birds were attracted to the
[1:05:59] carcasses and Abraham knew that whatever
[1:06:02] God was going to do while God was doing
[1:06:05] it he had to keep the birds off of
[1:06:09] it now watch so what did Abram do he
[1:06:12] just drove him away right you can see
[1:06:15] him down there among the among all these
[1:06:17] sacrifices and you know Abraham probably
[1:06:19] look like a crazy
[1:06:21] person they say our meetings are crazy
[1:06:23] you should have went to that meeting
[1:06:28] brother Allan he's out
[1:06:30] there get off of
[1:06:32] there on you bird get get get
[1:06:36] back huh what's he doing he's got to get
[1:06:39] rid of the
[1:06:40] birds oh my cuz the sacrifice had to
[1:06:44] remain clean had to be holy are you with
[1:06:47] me now so Abraham's out there shouting
[1:06:50] wo get get huh sorry I didn't mean to
[1:06:53] scare you but
[1:06:56] waving his arms like a mad
[1:06:58] man Sarah's probably looking at him like
[1:07:01] what in the
[1:07:04] world get off of here go away what's he
[1:07:08] doing he's running the birds
[1:07:12] off I'm going somewhere now brother Bon
[1:07:15] notice what he done he took those three
[1:07:17] animals cut them apart laid them piece
[1:07:19] by piece and then Abraham got back he
[1:07:21] said now that was the sacrifice and he
[1:07:23] watched until the sun was going down and
[1:07:26] fouls come down out of the air on
[1:07:28] Abraham sacrifice vultures and Abraham
[1:07:31] cast them out shoot them away what's
[1:07:35] this a type of Abraham's seed in the
[1:07:38] last day casting out Devils from the
[1:07:43] sacrifice oh Church casting away what's
[1:07:46] he doing casting out
[1:07:48] Devils get out of here devil I know
[1:07:51] sometimes we look silly up here you know
[1:07:53] brother Andrew come sometimes and preach
[1:07:54] and open the back door and and whatever
[1:07:56] open the side door whatever and tell the
[1:07:58] devil to get out and you think what in
[1:07:59] the world is he doing well that's what
[1:08:01] we're called to
[1:08:02] do right cast out
[1:08:04] Devils right that's what that's
[1:08:06] literally what we're called to do
[1:08:08] Abraham's seed in the last day casting
[1:08:10] out devils are you with me now he said
[1:08:14] God he said promised it the sacrifice
[1:08:17] Christ the same yesterday today and
[1:08:19] forever and all them unbelieving Spirits
[1:08:24] trying to devour that's right right so
[1:08:28] every time you come to church oh my and
[1:08:31] the word's being preached here come all
[1:08:33] them unbelieving Spirits right and start
[1:08:35] to come down try to Devour the sacrifice
[1:08:38] try to take it away from you or you
[1:08:40] can't receive your healing you can't be
[1:08:42] saved you've done too much all this
[1:08:44] going on in your mind and you're sitting
[1:08:45] there thinking well I might as well just
[1:08:47] quit I might as well just give up what's
[1:08:49] doing that it's a prince of the power of
[1:08:50] the air the fowls have come down on the
[1:08:53] sacrifice but it's time for the people
[1:08:55] of God God to stand up Abraham seed and
[1:08:57] begin to cast out them
[1:09:02] Devils now how do we cast out Devils oh
[1:09:06] my by preaching the word that's right by
[1:09:09] receiving the word by amaning the word
[1:09:12] right right brother Bron said give us
[1:09:14] power today Lord he said through the
[1:09:17] preaching of the word to cast every
[1:09:20] devil of doubt and Superstition and fear
[1:09:23] from the people's hearts and Minds that
[1:09:25] those who are bound by frustration amen
[1:09:28] and doubt might be brought into the arms
[1:09:30] of Christ oh I pray this morning that
[1:09:32] every bird would be shed away that every
[1:09:35] doubt every frustration would be Shed
[1:09:37] off of the
[1:09:39] sacrifice brother Ben why do you why do
[1:09:41] you have want to stay in the back and
[1:09:43] come out and try to be under the
[1:09:44] anointing and try to try to preach the
[1:09:46] way you do cuz I've got I got a mandate
[1:09:48] to Cast Away unbelieving Spirits I don't
[1:09:51] want people to leave I want those
[1:09:52] spirits to leave that's right we want
[1:09:55] spirits to be gone and we'll do what it
[1:09:57] takes to see those Spirits are gone
[1:10:00] that's why we set an atmosphere that's
[1:10:02] why we have a service the way we do
[1:10:04] we're we're working we're not working in
[1:10:05] just a natural realm but in a
[1:10:07] supernatural
[1:10:10] realm Hallelujah see we can't save
[1:10:13] nobody me Me By Me me preaching won't
[1:10:16] save nobody we can't heal nobody that's
[1:10:20] already done at Calvary brother Stuart
[1:10:22] can preach all day and never heal nobody
[1:10:24] never save nobody it's it's already done
[1:10:25] in Calvary all we can do is cast out
[1:10:27] Devils by preaching the word that's
[1:10:30] right now brother brandom goes on you
[1:10:32] can listen to a sermon called believing
[1:10:35] God brother brandham talks about this
[1:10:36] how he cast out Devils by the preaching
[1:10:37] of the word brother brandham said he
[1:10:40] would have been saved when he was 12 now
[1:10:42] you young people you remember that
[1:10:44] number 12 because so many of you are
[1:10:46] about to be
[1:10:47] 12 and remember Samuel was called at 12
[1:10:49] years of age to go in and to to be what
[1:10:53] he was and God called him at that time
[1:10:55] and give him a message to preach 12
[1:10:58] years old and and all the different
[1:11:01] things that we we talked about brother
[1:11:02] BR said he would have been saved when he
[1:11:04] was 12 he said but a spirit of unbelief
[1:11:07] hung over him telling him not to go to
[1:11:10] the
[1:11:12] altar well I wonder how many people
[1:11:15] would have already been saved already
[1:11:17] been delivered if it wasn't for that
[1:11:19] Spirit of unbelief right right and so
[1:11:23] brother B talks about that and he said
[1:11:24] he committ IED his church to cast them
[1:11:27] Devils out there you are in my name they
[1:11:30] shall cast out Devils you ain't going to
[1:11:32] heal nobody but you're going to cast The
[1:11:34] Devil away from them so they can accept
[1:11:36] the healing I've already done everything
[1:11:39] you have need of is already paid for but
[1:11:42] our job is to cast drive them fouls off
[1:11:45] get them birds
[1:11:46] away right every time you hear one
[1:11:48] flapping in get him out of
[1:11:51] here right he don't belong in here that
[1:11:54] demon of FL FR rtion of worry that tells
[1:11:57] you that that well we wonder you know
[1:11:59] maybe maybe it's all just a show maybe
[1:12:01] it all don't mean anything maybe it's
[1:12:03] just emotion drive him out that's right
[1:12:05] that devil tells you the message isn't
[1:12:07] right drive him out that devil that
[1:12:09] tries to tell you you can't be saved
[1:12:11] drive him out you young people that
[1:12:13] devil tries to tell well you'd have more
[1:12:15] fun in the world you'd be better off if
[1:12:17] youd leave and go out there somewhere
[1:12:18] and and live your best life drive him
[1:12:20] away let belief let Faith begin to
[1:12:23] settle in your heart cuz God's fixing to
[1:12:26] do something that's right hey man are
[1:12:30] you with me so
[1:12:31] far Hallelujah preachers he said stood
[1:12:35] on the
[1:12:36] platform and preached the gospel Devils
[1:12:40] scatter
[1:12:43] amen that's God's provided
[1:12:46] way brother Ben do you understand that I
[1:12:48] don't understand it sir but that's God's
[1:12:50] provided way right sir oh that's why
[1:12:56] Paul says he chose by the foolishness of
[1:12:59] preaching he didn't even say by the
[1:13:00] foolishness of hearing preaching though
[1:13:02] that's how faith is increased by the
[1:13:03] foolishness of preaching right by the fo
[1:13:06] some will be say listen God chose
[1:13:09] preaching for that purpose and that's
[1:13:12] why it's such a a job and we should we
[1:13:14] should make sure we're doing it the
[1:13:15] right way we we should make sure we're
[1:13:17] staying with the message of the hour but
[1:13:20] God chose preachers if if every preacher
[1:13:22] was wrong it wouldn't change what God
[1:13:24] did
[1:13:25] God chose
[1:13:27] preachers right preachers stood on the
[1:13:29] platform and preached the gospel Devils
[1:13:32] scatter amen he said the man come to the
[1:13:34] altar under conviction say I want to get
[1:13:36] saved he said he never saved the man he
[1:13:39] cast out the devil that's right and the
[1:13:41] man got saved amen hallelujah I believe
[1:13:45] God still confirms his word the same way
[1:13:48] that he did to Abraham we've been given
[1:13:50] a promise church we believe the message
[1:13:52] of the hour but we want God to confirm
[1:13:54] his word and when the fouls come down on
[1:13:56] the sacrifice let me be one gospel
[1:13:58] preacher who will stand up there and Sho
[1:14:00] the fouls off get rid of the fouls get
[1:14:02] rid of the birds let God begin to move
[1:14:07] again one of the reasons we go to church
[1:14:11] get the fouls shoed off the
[1:14:15] sacrifice oh
[1:14:16] my the natural Seed of Abraham failed
[1:14:21] brother bom taught us and they accepted
[1:14:23] law instead of Grace at SI but there is
[1:14:27] a seed he said a royal seed with the
[1:14:29] word stands true am you believe you're
[1:14:33] Abraham's seed now it's not just the
[1:14:35] preaching a preacher that cast out
[1:14:37] Devils It's You cast out Devils too
[1:14:40] because he said those that believe these
[1:14:42] signs shall follow them that believe you
[1:14:44] can cast out devils and I don't believe
[1:14:46] you have to be loud or or anything like
[1:14:48] that to cast out a devil but it's just
[1:14:50] the act of preaching the word is what
[1:14:51] does it it's the act in you of speaking
[1:14:53] the word and living the word
[1:14:55] said if you can't if you're not called
[1:14:57] to preach he said if you're called get
[1:14:58] behind the ppit and preach if you're not
[1:15:00] called to preach he said live a sermon
[1:15:03] he said oh how Jeffersonville needs
[1:15:04] thousands of lived voices I say oh how
[1:15:07] Hardy needs hundreds of thousands of
[1:15:09] lived
[1:15:10] [Music]
[1:15:13] voices I'm G I'm gonna get touch you
[1:15:15] here for a minute you realize what some
[1:15:18] of the damage has been done in this area
[1:15:22] by by people who didn't live it I'm
[1:15:24] talking many many years ago that's right
[1:15:27] that's right and and I I'll walk around
[1:15:29] people tell me you know I told a person
[1:15:32] recently we all the teachers of William
[1:15:34] brandom he said oh yeah he lived out on
[1:15:35] Worth Road no it wasn't
[1:15:41] him it wasn't him but I want you to
[1:15:44] think about
[1:15:45] this look at the damage that's been done
[1:15:47] over the years that's right look at the
[1:15:50] good that could be done and has been
[1:15:53] done amen by somebody who will live it
[1:15:56] that's right that's
[1:16:00] right by somebody who's been redeemed by
[1:16:03] somebody who's Changed by even somebody
[1:16:06] maybe who didn't live it but does now
[1:16:08] what a testimony it ought to be to our
[1:16:10] community to know that that we're not
[1:16:12] that way anymore we don't do that
[1:16:15] anymore that's not what we do yeah I was
[1:16:18] a sinner yeah I may have claimed to be a
[1:16:20] Christian and didn't live right but now
[1:16:22] I live for God and we're going to live
[1:16:25] for God and be a be an army of lived
[1:16:27] voices and I wonder how many young
[1:16:29] people there are out there I wonder how
[1:16:30] many people that grew up in church that
[1:16:33] that have been beat down by the world
[1:16:34] and beat down by what people did to them
[1:16:36] that wouldn't come back to the house of
[1:16:38] God if they knew there was a lived voice
[1:16:40] somewhere I say live it in the schools
[1:16:42] live it in the communities live it at
[1:16:44] the bank live it on the factory floor
[1:16:46] live it where in your community where
[1:16:48] you're at and if there's a seat of God
[1:16:50] there they'll come to it amen if the
[1:16:52] damage could be done then it can be
[1:16:54] undone
[1:17:01] I hope you're hearing me today there's a
[1:17:03] sea that stands true casting out Devils
[1:17:05] doing great signs and wonders somebody's
[1:17:08] got to do it church let it be me this
[1:17:11] morning getting all the unbelief away
[1:17:13] from the word keeping the sacrifice
[1:17:15] clean keeping the word holy keep it
[1:17:17] reverenced not put anything with it add
[1:17:19] anything to it just keeping it away
[1:17:21] standing on guard let nothing touch it
[1:17:27] that's what we got to do with the word
[1:17:29] we'll let nothing touch it if I can't
[1:17:31] brother B said if I can't fulfill the
[1:17:32] promise I won't stand in somebody else's
[1:17:34] way that can there you go that's
[1:17:37] right the promise is still true we
[1:17:40] acknowledge the word is right whether we
[1:17:42] do have always done right or not the
[1:17:43] word is right that's right the word is
[1:17:45] right when we come back to that it gives
[1:17:47] us a freedom of knowing oh I'm not
[1:17:49] relying on my works I'm relying on him
[1:17:51] and he can help me to be a lived voice
[1:17:54] that's right in the world that I live in
[1:17:57] keep the sacrifice clean keeping the
[1:18:00] word holy keep it reverence not put
[1:18:02] anything with it add anything to it just
[1:18:04] keep it away stand on guard oh let me
[1:18:07] fulfill that Lord let that become a
[1:18:10] promise in my life right amen but
[1:18:14] nothing touch it when the sun was going
[1:18:18] down deep sleep fell upon Abram l a
[1:18:22] horror of great Darkness fell upon on
[1:18:25] him brother brandom said the deep sleep
[1:18:27] was a type of
[1:18:28] death which we all must come to we don't
[1:18:32] go by way of the Rapture we're going to
[1:18:33] go by way of the Grave that's right the
[1:18:36] horror of Darkness was hell which
[1:18:39] without his Mercy all of us would be
[1:18:40] there all of us would be there amen
[1:18:43] without his
[1:18:45] Mercy Genesis
[1:18:47] 15:13 begins to speak to Abram while
[1:18:49] he's in this condition he said to Abram
[1:18:52] no of aury thy seed shall be a stranger
[1:18:55] and the land that is not there shall
[1:18:56] serve them they shall afflict them 400
[1:18:58] years also that Nation whom they Shall
[1:19:01] Serve will I judge afterward shall they
[1:19:03] come out with great substance thou shall
[1:19:05] go to thy fathers in peace thou shall be
[1:19:07] buried in a good old age but in the
[1:19:09] fourth generation they shall come hither
[1:19:11] again for the iniquity of the amorites
[1:19:13] is not yet full and it came to pass when
[1:19:16] the sun went down and it was dark Behold
[1:19:19] a smoking furnace and a burning lamp
[1:19:22] that passed between
[1:19:25] those pieces he was torn apart on
[1:19:28] Calvary do we believe that and the
[1:19:30] pillar of fire came down after his body
[1:19:33] was broken was separated into his church
[1:19:36] and now brother brandom taught us that
[1:19:37] the spirit that's in US must dovetail
[1:19:40] with that Spirit just like the pieces of
[1:19:43] the animal would fit back together the B
[1:19:47] said they kill an animal standing
[1:19:48] between it tear the piece of goat skin
[1:19:50] apart he said one took one and and when
[1:19:52] the Covenant was confirmed they brought
[1:19:53] the pieces together and they had to
[1:19:55] dovetail just exactly now what God is
[1:19:58] showing him here is this on these
[1:20:00] sacrifices speaking of Christ how God
[1:20:02] took Jesus to Calvary and tore him apart
[1:20:05] and received the body up into heaven and
[1:20:07] sent the spirit down upon us that the
[1:20:09] same Spirit was on him has to be on you
[1:20:11] to dtail with the body to be the bride
[1:20:14] at the end time you can't be the bride
[1:20:16] without the power of the Holy
[1:20:18] Ghost right it takes that to be the
[1:20:21] bride even though you're called to that
[1:20:23] but what that tells me is every person
[1:20:25] who's predestined to it will receive the
[1:20:27] baptism of the Holy Ghost so you don't
[1:20:29] have to worry about it you just go and
[1:20:32] and claim it and believe it and receive
[1:20:34] it and you'll experience
[1:20:36] it right because it is a definite
[1:20:39] experience sir now he said what God is
[1:20:43] showing him here is speaking of Christ
[1:20:45] he sent the spirit that was on him and
[1:20:46] has to duvail to be the bride at the end
[1:20:48] time now he said in this we find when
[1:20:50] they made this Covenant in them days
[1:20:51] they drew it out on a piece of sheep
[1:20:52] skin or leather and once they kill
[1:20:54] killed then they killed an animal and
[1:20:55] stood between the pieces he said and and
[1:20:59] uh he said stood between the pieces and
[1:21:01] cut it this their Covenant into two
[1:21:03] their words pulled into two like that I
[1:21:04] don't have a piece of paper up here but
[1:21:06] he actually took a piece of paper and he
[1:21:07] tore it into two and when the paper was
[1:21:10] torn into then the two pieces would fit
[1:21:12] back together but they would be the only
[1:21:14] things that would fit back together it
[1:21:16] would be very hard very difficult to to
[1:21:19] replicate that he said so it could not
[1:21:22] be duplicated he said now we see he said
[1:21:25] in this also in this Covenant that he
[1:21:26] showed there what he would do how God
[1:21:27] would tear apart Christ Jesus and the
[1:21:29] body was raised up sits on the right
[1:21:30] hand of God Majesty on high and the
[1:21:32] spirit of Christ was brought down upon
[1:21:34] the earth now the Bible tells us if we
[1:21:36] are
[1:21:37] christs then we are Abraham's seed
[1:21:40] because he was the royal Seed of Abraham
[1:21:42] right he said and HS according to the
[1:21:46] promise now get back with me for a
[1:21:48] minute I know I lost you there for a
[1:21:50] minute but come on
[1:21:52] back it's all right he Saidi am the vine
[1:21:57] and you are the
[1:21:58] branches he that abideth in me and I in
[1:22:01] him the same bringeth forth much fruit
[1:22:03] someone say much fruit for without me
[1:22:07] you can do
[1:22:08] nothing
[1:22:10] nothing amen it takes him all right John
[1:22:14] 14:12 verily verily I say un you he that
[1:22:16] believeth on me the works that I do
[1:22:19] shall he do also and Greater Works than
[1:22:22] these shall he do because I go unto my
[1:22:25] father right yet a little while and the
[1:22:28] world seeth me no more but ye see me
[1:22:31] because I live ye shall live also a
[1:22:35] little while and the world seeth me no
[1:22:37] more the world there is the Greek word
[1:22:38] Cosmos which means World Order sees me
[1:22:41] no more yet you shall see me I being a
[1:22:43] personal pronoun I'll be with you even
[1:22:45] in you to the end of the world making
[1:22:47] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:22:49] and forever what does that mean Church
[1:22:51] it means he still confirms his Covenant
[1:22:54] with Believers by filling them with his
[1:22:57] spirit and by producing his Works
[1:23:00] through them to the world right he is
[1:23:03] still a supernatural God who is able to
[1:23:08] take care of any problem do we believe
[1:23:11] that or don't we believe it Church he's
[1:23:12] able to take care of every situation
[1:23:15] he's able to to to we can believe him
[1:23:18] for any issue big or
[1:23:21] small a little while in the world won't
[1:23:23] see me but you'll see me because I'll be
[1:23:24] with you and even in you now brother
[1:23:26] Brandon said to believe the word is to
[1:23:29] receive the word and to let it become
[1:23:32] life he said now God showing there how
[1:23:34] he was confirming this Covenant it has
[1:23:37] to be that way the church not an
[1:23:38] organization not a denomination but the
[1:23:40] individual and God has to become the
[1:23:42] Same Spirit that's God's purpose in the
[1:23:45] beginning to become the Same Spirit now
[1:23:48] the turtle do and the pigeon but the
[1:23:49] said we're related Eve come from Adam's
[1:23:52] side right the same spirit that dwelt in
[1:23:55] Christ dwells in us he confirms his
[1:23:57] Covenant to us when the Covenant is
[1:24:00] manifested in our lives it brings forth
[1:24:02] Faith now watch Abraham believed God but
[1:24:04] he needed a confirmation of his faith
[1:24:07] and God gave him what he needed then I
[1:24:11] believe that if we need a
[1:24:13] confirmation God will give us one sir it
[1:24:16] may not confirm it to the world in fact
[1:24:19] the world might have called what Abraham
[1:24:20] saw crazy but to Abraham because he was
[1:24:24] a Believer it confirmed his faith see
[1:24:29] when God comes and settles down over you
[1:24:31] and you begin to feel the presence of
[1:24:32] God you begin to know God in a very real
[1:24:34] way you may not you may not feel it or
[1:24:37] you may not be able to express that to
[1:24:39] other people as far as they may look at
[1:24:41] that and say well that's just emotion
[1:24:43] but to you it becomes a confirmation of
[1:24:45] Faith that's right now to a person that
[1:24:47] had no faith there's no confirmation but
[1:24:50] to a person who has faith it becomes a
[1:24:52] confirmation you can say he's here I can
[1:24:54] feel him I know that he's real why
[1:24:56] because you already had Faith to believe
[1:24:59] it right now are you with you so far I'm
[1:25:03] trying to preach fast because we had a
[1:25:05] lot of ground to cover but we're doing
[1:25:07] good now how does he confirm his word
[1:25:11] his word is the Covenant how many
[1:25:13] believe that everything God said is what
[1:25:16] he has promised to do
[1:25:18] yes that's powerful brother West
[1:25:21] everything in the scripture is what God
[1:25:23] promised to do
[1:25:24] do right and and then what does he do
[1:25:27] the message of the hour comes and takes
[1:25:29] these promises and makes them real in
[1:25:31] our
[1:25:32] day right makes them real to us shines
[1:25:36] light on those promises so we can look
[1:25:38] at the message of the hour and see God's
[1:25:42] interpretation of how those promises
[1:25:44] would be revealed in our day and what
[1:25:47] promises are for our day and we know
[1:25:48] that there are specific signs and
[1:25:50] Promises confirmations for particular
[1:25:53] ages but we know that there are some
[1:25:55] that follow just follow Believers now
[1:25:57] Mark 16:5 he said to them go ye into all
[1:26:00] the world and preach the gospel to Every
[1:26:02] Creature he that believeth and is
[1:26:04] baptized shall be saved he that
[1:26:06] believeth not shall be damned and these
[1:26:08] signs shall follow them that believe in
[1:26:09] my name shall they cast out Devils they
[1:26:11] shall speak with new tongues they shall
[1:26:13] take up serpents if they drink any
[1:26:14] deadly thing it shall not hurt them they
[1:26:16] shall lay hands on the sick and they
[1:26:18] shall recover well it sounds like
[1:26:20] Supernatural to
[1:26:21] me so then after the Lord had spoke unto
[1:26:24] them right we read on he was received up
[1:26:27] into heaven and sat on the right hand of
[1:26:29] God and they went forth and preached
[1:26:32] everywhere why because God told them to
[1:26:34] right preached everywhere the Lord
[1:26:37] working with them and confirming the
[1:26:41] word with signs
[1:26:45] following God will do that if we just
[1:26:48] ask I I don't like it you know I was
[1:26:51] raised in an overly you know we were
[1:26:54] every little thing was a sign and things
[1:26:56] like that and so I got my I I I keep
[1:26:59] quiet about a lot of things God's moving
[1:27:02] Among Us he's doing something I can see
[1:27:05] it in your lives I can see it on your
[1:27:08] faces when I preach God's doing
[1:27:11] something we don't need to forget that
[1:27:13] we had a very simple thing happened not
[1:27:14] long ago uh sister uh uh Pucket was
[1:27:18] Sister Jessica was in church and it was
[1:27:20] a very simple thing that that that
[1:27:23] happen happen but it's powerful she come
[1:27:26] up and and that's a big thing for her
[1:27:28] she's not here this morning they may be
[1:27:29] watching at home but it's a big thing
[1:27:31] for her to come up and brother Logan you
[1:27:34] know that to come up front to be prayed
[1:27:35] for she got a lot of anxiety and things
[1:27:37] and and and so for her to come up front
[1:27:39] was a big deal and and she come up to be
[1:27:42] prayed for and I believe that's that's
[1:27:44] just what the word says to do amen it
[1:27:46] says if you need healing call for the
[1:27:48] Elders of the church right it's not
[1:27:51] always wait until something they call
[1:27:52] for you but you call them
[1:27:55] and so she did that and she come up to
[1:27:57] be prayed for and and we prayed for her
[1:27:59] and I gave her a prayer cloth I said go
[1:28:01] put that under your pillow you just
[1:28:02] believe God and it'll be okay she was
[1:28:04] losing her
[1:28:05] hair and and she made a public testimony
[1:28:07] of it so I will as well when when she uh
[1:28:11] when she went home immediately her hair
[1:28:13] began to start growing back and things
[1:28:14] begin to happen and she got her hair
[1:28:16] back he said that's a little thing but
[1:28:20] you know we're
[1:28:21] we're we overcome by the by the blood of
[1:28:24] the lamb and the word of Our Testimony
[1:28:25] right brother Andrew Glover was in uh in
[1:28:29] up at brother Ben Beard's Church
[1:28:30] recently preaching and he's talking to
[1:28:32] me on the phone on a Sunday morning and
[1:28:34] I was telling him about that that had
[1:28:37] happened and he and he told me wow
[1:28:39] that's that's powerful he said that
[1:28:40] morning there was a a sister in that
[1:28:43] church that had the same issue and he
[1:28:45] didn't know nothing about it he said she
[1:28:47] come up to be prayed for and he said I
[1:28:49] just got off the phone with brother Ben
[1:28:51] PR telling me that God did this for a
[1:28:53] sister in his church he said I believe
[1:28:55] he can do it for
[1:28:58] you see it's not just for us it's for
[1:29:00] somebody else and that you say that's a
[1:29:03] little thing but aren't there some
[1:29:04] little things maybe that you have need
[1:29:05] of that God's able to do I believe he
[1:29:08] can do
[1:29:10] it and we don't make a big deal about
[1:29:12] things and try to promote ourselves
[1:29:14] we're just here to preach the word and
[1:29:16] to drive the Devils off and let the word
[1:29:18] settle down Among Us and the word will
[1:29:20] produce the results because signs follow
[1:29:23] the Believers and I believe that there
[1:29:25] are believers here this morning I
[1:29:27] believe you are
[1:29:28] believers some of youall have great
[1:29:30] testimonies coming out of the world and
[1:29:32] being changed and and drinking and
[1:29:34] smoking and drugs and everything else
[1:29:36] and coming out and some of it happened
[1:29:38] years ago some of it recently and you
[1:29:40] come out of all that you come back to
[1:29:41] the house of God and God saved you and
[1:29:43] changed you and I believe every one of
[1:29:45] you sitting here this morning is a
[1:29:47] testimony of what God can
[1:29:50] do we look so much at what people have
[1:29:53] been why don't we look look at what God
[1:29:54] made those
[1:29:57] people why don't we look at where
[1:29:59] they're at today yeah they they they did
[1:30:01] wrong and they failed but look where
[1:30:03] they're at they didn't stop they didn't
[1:30:04] quit because God called them sir God
[1:30:07] saved them and God changed
[1:30:09] them and I'm believing for every one of
[1:30:11] you I know not everybody we look at that
[1:30:14] sometimes say Well everybody's not where
[1:30:15] I am well I'm glad you're farther up the
[1:30:17] road but there may be something in your
[1:30:20] life that that needs a little structure
[1:30:22] too a little change too I said Lord when
[1:30:24] I come to the house of God let me be
[1:30:26] changed let me be Washed by the Water of
[1:30:29] the word no matter what condition I'm in
[1:30:31] but give them Grace cuz you were there
[1:30:33] one day you were there one day sir give
[1:30:36] them Grace to grow
[1:30:39] too see preaching the gospel now brother
[1:30:43] brandham says this I've got to get this
[1:30:45] brother Bram said that is the general
[1:30:47] orders from Jesus Christ to be carried
[1:30:50] out until the day he returns
[1:30:54] yeah that's what we got to do preach the
[1:30:57] word let God confirm
[1:31:00] it that's the general orders now what if
[1:31:03] they left there and only told the story
[1:31:06] but nothing ever happened how many
[1:31:08] Christians would there be think about
[1:31:12] this Christianity spread all over the
[1:31:14] world like wildfire not just because
[1:31:15] they told the
[1:31:17] story but because it was
[1:31:20] confirmed right brother brand said it
[1:31:22] didn't even stir up the devil
[1:31:24] when they all received the baptism of
[1:31:26] the Holy Ghost he said but when a person
[1:31:28] got
[1:31:30] healed he said that really stirred him
[1:31:32] up why because it was
[1:31:35] confirmation right because the devil
[1:31:38] doubts if you have the Holy
[1:31:40] Ghost he don't know right he doubts it
[1:31:44] he might know I don't know
[1:31:46] but but what one way or the other he he
[1:31:49] can make you doubt it try to sure he
[1:31:52] will that's his job
[1:31:54] but but if somebody getss healed like
[1:31:57] that's
[1:31:58] evident right it's evident he sees that
[1:32:01] he knows that that's why he fights it so
[1:32:03] much look so he said he fought Divine
[1:32:06] Healing that's when they really cracked
[1:32:08] down on the church is when the lame man
[1:32:10] walked because everybody knew he was
[1:32:12] lame sir and everybody knew he got up
[1:32:14] yes sir and I say what a great testimony
[1:32:17] it is not when a a well man walks but
[1:32:20] when a lame man walks when a sinner
[1:32:23] comes to God and they are saved and they
[1:32:25] begin to walk right and act right what a
[1:32:27] blessing that
[1:32:29] is
[1:32:30] amen everywhere those Believers went
[1:32:34] they preached the gospel they didn't
[1:32:35] just tell the story but the B said Paul
[1:32:37] said the word came in power as well as
[1:32:39] voice the word preach actually
[1:32:41] demonstrated itself like a flaming
[1:32:43] cutting sword it went to the
[1:32:45] Consciousness consciousness of men came
[1:32:47] say it consciousness of men that but and
[1:32:50] like a surgeon's knife it cut out the
[1:32:53] diseases and set captives free
[1:32:56] everywhere those early Believers went
[1:32:58] they went preaching the gospel word and
[1:33:00] God confirmed that word with signs
[1:33:02] following oh my the sick were healed
[1:33:05] Devils were cast out they spoke in new
[1:33:07] tongues that was the word in action
[1:33:10] listen that word has never failed
[1:33:13] someone say never failed it has never
[1:33:16] failed in the mouths of believing
[1:33:18] Christians how many believing Christians
[1:33:20] do we have here it has never failed oh
[1:33:23] my speak it this morning I am saved I am
[1:33:26] healed I am going to heaven it has never
[1:33:29] failed in the mouths of believing
[1:33:31] Christians oh that's powerful and in
[1:33:34] this last stage it is here stronger and
[1:33:37] greater than ever I believe that church
[1:33:41] I believe he knew what he was talking
[1:33:42] about you said well the church has
[1:33:44] failed we need to go do something else
[1:33:46] reinvent the wheel no we we have what
[1:33:48] God promised us we would have that word
[1:33:51] is stronger and greater than ever in the
[1:33:53] true word br
[1:33:54] oh little flock you little minority hold
[1:33:57] on to the word fill your mouth and heart
[1:33:59] with it and someday God will give you
[1:34:01] the kingdom do you believe that today do
[1:34:04] are you that little flock do you believe
[1:34:06] one day he'll give you the kingdom see
[1:34:08] God still supernaturally confirms his
[1:34:10] word if you believe the that we find
[1:34:13] here after Abraham had done all these
[1:34:15] great things believing God holding to
[1:34:17] the promise separating himself and all
[1:34:19] along following out the way of carrying
[1:34:20] of The Commandments of the lord we find
[1:34:22] out that God appeared to to him at the
[1:34:24] altar and Abraham asked him the question
[1:34:26] he said now who is my Heir but this
[1:34:28] elaser of Damascus and now you promis me
[1:34:30] a seed and I want you to do something I
[1:34:32] want you to confirm this promise to me
[1:34:35] and God said he would confirm it to
[1:34:36] Abraham confirming the Covenant he had
[1:34:38] made between him and Abraham he's going
[1:34:40] to give him a sign that it's going to be
[1:34:43] true that even though he's old he's
[1:34:45] about 85 now but yet he's going to give
[1:34:48] proof to him Pro to him by a sign he's
[1:34:50] going to keep that
[1:34:52] Covenant you saw you said I thought
[1:34:54] signs were just for
[1:34:56] unbelievers no cuz look what the prophet
[1:34:58] said oh I'm so glad that God always
[1:35:01] gives the
[1:35:03] signs right the unbelievers won't
[1:35:05] believe it anyway right what does a sign
[1:35:07] do to the unbeliever it judges the
[1:35:09] unbeliever the sign is not why you
[1:35:11] believe it confirms the faith you
[1:35:14] already have are you with me
[1:35:17] now he said we ought to know today that
[1:35:19] the hour that we're now living there is
[1:35:21] supposed to be a sign in the Earth at
[1:35:23] this time were to look for that sign
[1:35:27] he's speaking of the sign of the son of
[1:35:29] man what he called the Messianic
[1:35:32] sign when Jesus come to Jerusalem God
[1:35:36] confirmed his word by manifesting his
[1:35:37] word you remember the story I'm closing
[1:35:39] in just a moment but you remember the
[1:35:41] story how that he come riding on a
[1:35:43] donkey and the people were gathered
[1:35:45] there and and and in fact the scripture
[1:35:47] tells us that they were gathered there
[1:35:49] because they heard about
[1:35:51] Lazarus right and they saw what God did
[1:35:54] with Lazarus and so they were gathered
[1:35:57] along the road and they laid palm
[1:35:58] branches in his way you remember the
[1:36:00] story and brother brandom said that
[1:36:02] talked about how there were three kinds
[1:36:03] of Believers there and and each one some
[1:36:05] were some were curious what was going on
[1:36:08] some were against it but some were
[1:36:09] really true believers and they laid The
[1:36:12] Palms in the way and they began to cry
[1:36:14] out Hosanna to him he that cometh uh to
[1:36:17] God from God in the highest and they
[1:36:18] begin to cry these things and what
[1:36:20] happens the Pharisees said make them
[1:36:22] shut up
[1:36:24] and and Jesus said if these keep their
[1:36:26] silence he said the stones will cry
[1:36:30] out right but what was it God was
[1:36:33] confirming his word on the mountain God
[1:36:37] was keeping his word oh my confirming
[1:36:41] his word by doing what he promised he
[1:36:43] would do oh my now look he was going to
[1:36:47] do that for Abraham he's done that for
[1:36:50] us now brother brandom talks about Mount
[1:36:52] Sunset and we all know what happened on
[1:36:54] Mount Sunset that's where the Angels
[1:36:56] gathered with brother brandom and they
[1:36:58] formed a cloud now you may not believe
[1:37:00] that I believe
[1:37:02] that right what's the difference in us
[1:37:04] well I believe and you don't
[1:37:06] believe right I mean that's the only
[1:37:08] difference because you can't prove it
[1:37:09] didn't
[1:37:11] happen right you say prove it happened
[1:37:14] well prove to me Jesus even lived you
[1:37:17] can't do that by science but we believe
[1:37:19] it don't
[1:37:21] we right some people try to cast doubt
[1:37:23] on that the thing is if they'd apply
[1:37:24] that to every area of their life they'd
[1:37:26] be insane that's right because you got
[1:37:28] to believe something H prove prove that
[1:37:30] your wife loves
[1:37:31] you that's
[1:37:34] tough prove your H prove your husband
[1:37:37] loves you you can't prove
[1:37:40] love right they could be Faking
[1:37:43] It come on church but you believe
[1:37:47] it why do you believe it you love them
[1:37:50] too right I believe this message because
[1:37:52] I love this message amen there's
[1:37:54] something inside of me that cries out
[1:37:56] and says that's right it's not me it's
[1:37:58] something inside of me something inside
[1:38:01] of you crying out that's right I believe
[1:38:03] those Seven Angels were there I believe
[1:38:05] they formed a cloud and then they took a
[1:38:08] picture a few days before a few days
[1:38:09] after they took a picture of the cloud
[1:38:11] as it was traveling now uh and and we
[1:38:14] have that picture now brother Brandon
[1:38:16] said what's happened upon Mount Sunset
[1:38:18] happened on a mountain brother brand
[1:38:20] called sunset Mountain or Sunset Peak
[1:38:21] there in Arizona it's go it's God
[1:38:24] confirming his
[1:38:26] word amen he still confirms his word
[1:38:30] that's what all this noise is about it's
[1:38:32] God fulfilling his promised word again
[1:38:35] of Revelation 10
[1:38:37] 1-7 1:7 and in the days of the sounding
[1:38:40] of the seventh Angel's message the
[1:38:42] mystery of God should be finished the
[1:38:43] hidden Mystery of Revelation 10 1-7 the
[1:38:46] last message to the last Church age
[1:38:48] fulfills exactly in this age St Luke
[1:38:51] 17:30 the day when the the son of man
[1:38:54] shall be revealed watch what's he saying
[1:38:56] God promised it we believed it he has
[1:38:59] confirmed it oh what confidence that
[1:39:02] ought to give us
[1:39:03] today the B said the observatories all
[1:39:05] them in Tucson are still asking research
[1:39:08] of science trying to find out what it is
[1:39:10] so high they can't be fog Mis or nothing
[1:39:11] up there what it what did it where's it
[1:39:13] at they're just as puzzled of that
[1:39:15] Supernatural Halo hanging under in the
[1:39:17] sky as they were when the Magi come in
[1:39:19] following a star saying where is he this
[1:39:21] born King of the Jews what was it God
[1:39:24] fulfilling his word there shall rise a
[1:39:26] star out of Jacob and the god of Heaven
[1:39:29] promised evening time would have evening
[1:39:31] lights three years ago he said this
[1:39:33] mystery was a prophecy this was in 1965
[1:39:36] he's referring to a sermon he preached
[1:39:38] in 1962 called is this the sign of the
[1:39:40] end sir when he talked about the seven
[1:39:43] Thunders and Revelation 10 1-7 and he
[1:39:46] and he and he prophesied what would
[1:39:47] happen and then it become a reality
[1:39:49] listen what he's saying three years ago
[1:39:51] this mystery was a prophecy what time is
[1:39:53] sir but now it's history it's ped the
[1:39:57] promise is fulfilled what time is it sir
[1:40:00] and what's this attraction God
[1:40:02] fulfilling his word he's the same
[1:40:04] yesterday today and forever do we
[1:40:06] believe that today you can have
[1:40:08] confidence in the message of the hour
[1:40:09] just the same as Abraham had confidence
[1:40:12] God he he confirmed his word go listen
[1:40:15] to Jehovah Gyra number one in 1964 when
[1:40:17] brother Brandon preaches that and he
[1:40:19] preaches the sermon but he doesn't stop
[1:40:21] at the sermon what does he do at the end
[1:40:22] he begins to reveal the secrets of their
[1:40:24] heart he said this is God confirming his
[1:40:26] word just like he did to Abraham God
[1:40:30] confirming oh I believe he's still
[1:40:32] confirming his word today God didn't die
[1:40:34] when brother Brown died brother Brown
[1:40:35] was in the Tomb at Jeffersonville his
[1:40:37] body's there in the Tomb but God didn't
