[0:03] [Music]
[0:06] The storms were raging.
[0:10] The waters around them were trled that
[0:16] night.
[0:18] Fear filled their hearts.
[0:22] They felt they would die.
[0:25] They failed to remember
[0:29] the master was nigh.
[0:34] He spoke the word
[0:37] and the winds all stood still.
[0:41] Even the waters
[0:45] oyed his will
[0:49] and he calm their storms
[0:53] like he will mine
[0:56] if I just remember
[1:00] that he lives inside.
[1:04] So why should I worry?
[1:08] Why should I fear?
[1:11] When this very same Jesus,
[1:15] he is always so near. He lives in my
[1:21] heart and he hears when I cry.
[1:27] I'll call on his name till the storm
[1:31] passes by.
[1:34] [Music]
[1:38] We read in the Bible
[1:42] how he walked with them, brought light
[1:46] to their darkness
[1:49] when the way grew so dim.
[1:53] How great it would be to have his
[1:57] footsteps in mind,
[2:00] to walk with the master.
[2:03] [Music]
[2:05] all of the time. And when trials come
[2:12] and death seems so nice, just call on
[2:16] the master.
[2:19] He'll be there on time.
[2:23] And when sickness comes
[2:26] and my body's in pain,
[2:30] all I have to do
[2:34] is call on his name.
[2:38] So why should I worry?
[2:42] Why should I fear when this very same
[2:47] Jesus,
[2:49] he is always so near?
[2:53] He lives in my heart and he hears when I
[2:58] cry.
[3:00] I'll call on his name till the storm
[3:05] passes by.
[3:08] [Music]
[3:11] We read in the Bible
[3:15] how he walked with them, brought light
[3:19] to their darkness
[3:22] when the way grew so dim.
[3:26] How great it would be to have his

[3:33] to walk with the master.

[3:49] the master.
[3:52] He'll be there all time.
[3:56] And when sickness comes
[3:59] and my body's in pain,

[4:31] cry.
[4:32] I'll call on his name till the storm
[4:37] passes by.
[4:40] Oh, why should I worry?
[4:44] Why should I fear when this very same
[4:49] Jesus,
[4:51] he is always so near?
[4:54] He lives in my heart and he hears when I
[5:00] cry.
[5:02] I'll call on his name till the storm
[5:06] passes by.
[5:09] I'll call on his name till the stor
[5:14] passes by.
