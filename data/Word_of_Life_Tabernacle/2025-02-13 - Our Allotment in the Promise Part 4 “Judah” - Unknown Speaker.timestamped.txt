[46:16] thankful for that uh Genesis 498
[46:19] remember the service Sunday brother uh
[46:22] uh George Moore will be here Sunday

[46:26] afternoon service will be for for
[46:28] married couples if you've been married
[46:29] you're welcome to come but it'll be
[46:31] geared towards married couples Genesis
[46:35] 498 Judah Thou Art he whom thy Brethren
[46:38] shall praise thy hand shall be in the
[46:41] neck of thine
[46:42] enemies thy father's children shall bow
[46:45] down before thee Judah is a lion's welp
[46:49] from the prey my son Thou Art gone up he
[46:52] stooped down he couched as a lion and as
[46:54] an old lion who shall Rouse him up the
[46:57] scepter shall not depart from Judah or a
[47:00] lawgiver from between his feet until
[47:03] Shiloh come unto him shall the Gathering
[47:06] of the people be binding his fo unto the
[47:10] vine and his ass's Colt unto the choice
[47:13] Vine he washed his garments in wine his
[47:16] clothes in the blood of grapes his eyes
[47:19] shall be red with wine and his teeth
[47:22] white with milk I pray the Lord would
[47:24] add his Blessing to the word you may be
[47:26] seated this evening
[47:29] in the Old Testament inheritance was
[47:31] divided by lot but the oldest uh son
[47:36] would get a double portion and that was
[47:39] called the birthright it's the special
[47:42] uh the special blessing given or the
[47:44] special privileges of being the
[47:46] firstborn so they were very careful uh
[47:49] to acknowledge even with twins who was
[47:51] the first born and who was second as we
[47:54] see with Esau and Jacob because the
[47:57] firstborn had the right to the father's
[47:59] name to carry on the father's business
[48:02] receive a double portion of the father's
[48:05] estate uh but we found in 1st Chronicles
[48:08] 5:1 I actually got a question about this
[48:10] and so we'll go into a little bit of of
[48:12] detail here in 1st Chronicles 51 it says
[48:16] now the sons of Reuben the firstborn of
[48:17] Israel remember we talked about Reuben
[48:19] the first uh Wednesday that I did this
[48:22] he said for he was the firstborn but for
[48:24] as much as he defiled his father's bed
[48:26] his birth right was given to the sons of
[48:28] Joseph the son of Israel and the
[48:30] genealogy is not to be reckoned after
[48:32] the birthright but then he said for
[48:34] Judah prevailed above his Brethren and
[48:37] of of him came the chief ruler but the
[48:40] birthright was Joseph so you see the
[48:43] Ruben was the firstborn but he did not
[48:45] get the birthright his father gave it to
[48:48] Joseph who was the favorite son but
[48:51] Judah
[48:53] prevailed he actually earned the right
[48:57] to be the ruler in Israel oh and I'm so
[49:01] grateful that there was a lamb worthy to
[49:04] be the lion of the tribe of Judah was
[49:06] worthy to take the book and open the
[49:09] seals this is this is good stuff I this
[49:12] will be more familiar to you tonight
[49:14] because it's things probably you've
[49:16] heard about Judah but I believe it'll be
[49:18] a blessing now Reuben was the Natural
[49:21] Choice Joseph was his father's choice
[49:24] but Judah was God's choice choice and
[49:28] and we are God's choice today you may
[49:30] not be the church's choice or even the
[49:33] pastor's choice or somebody else's
[49:35] choice but hopefully you're your
[49:37] husband's choice or your wife's choice
[49:39] but even if you weren't you're still
[49:41] God's
[49:42] choice God's choice will always Prevail
[49:47] it will prevail so God saw something in
[49:49] Judah and put something in Judah that
[49:52] would make him Prevail the word Prevail
[49:54] means to be or to make Superior to
[49:57] achieve something to increase to be
[50:00] strong to Prevail and so God has put
[50:03] something in you you young men God has
[50:05] put something in you to Prevail he's put
[50:08] something in you to overcome right we've
[50:10] talked about how we must overcome and
[50:13] what the blessings that would come the
[50:15] uh to the Overcomer and so there's
[50:17] something in you that God sees that will
[50:19] prevail there's lots of churches there's
[50:22] lots of people but God called you to the
[50:24] message of the hour because he saw
[50:26] something in you oh Church you say well
[50:29] I can't overcome no you can overcome
[50:31] because God called you to this message
[50:34] because there's a prevailing power on
[50:36] the inside of you
[50:38] already so the the the pre the ability
[50:41] to Prevail was in Judah now the name
[50:44] Judah means
[50:45] praise praise from Genesis 29:35 when
[50:50] his mother uh bore him she conceived
[50:53] again and bear a son and she said now
[50:56] will will I praise the Lord therefore
[50:58] she called his name Judah and left
[51:01] bearing that word praise the definition
[51:04] of it is literally to throw out the hand
[51:07] to extend Hands In Worship I'm going to
[51:11] go on down a little bit of a rabbit
[51:13] Trail here but it's on purpose because I
[51:15] think it's important that we understand
[51:17] why we do what we do in worship and I
[51:21] know sometimes a song leader will ask
[51:23] you or a pastor will ask you lift your
[51:25] hands up to him and
[51:27] and maybe you feel awkward doing that
[51:29] and what am I doing with my hands up in
[51:31] church well there's a very good reason
[51:33] why that we do that it's a Biblical mode
[51:36] of worship that when she had Judah she
[51:39] said now my hands are going to be up I'm
[51:43] going to extend my hands in worship
[51:45] because he's given me this child and so
[51:48] n none of the other children did she
[51:50] speak that over but over Judah from
[51:53] which that would be the one that Christ
[51:55] would come from the the lineage that
[51:57] Christ would come from would be Judah
[51:59] listen to me he's the only one that we
[52:01] worship like that he's the only one that
[52:03] we lift our hand to I is Christ and so
[52:06] he's the lion of the tribe of Judah and
[52:08] when we raise our hands in worship we
[52:10] are showing our gratitude to him and our
[52:13] surrender to him amen right it's it's a
[52:17] in the Old Testament a hand raised was
[52:19] more than just uh it was more than just
[52:22] a a a show it was more than just
[52:25] something you do CU every everybody else
[52:27] did it but it was it it was a posture
[52:30] that was a
[52:31] response to what had been
[52:34] done right and it was also a vow and a
[52:37] testament you'll find all through the
[52:39] Old Testament I didn't have time for the
[52:41] scriptures tonight we'd be here all
[52:42] night but but here even a good example
[52:45] is Abraham when Abraham comes and the
[52:48] king of Sodom wants to give him some
[52:50] money and he said I lifted my hand to
[52:53] the Lord he said that I would not take
[52:56] any money from you so you because you
[52:58] might say you made Abraham Rich yeah so
[53:01] he said I lifted my hand what was he
[53:03] doing he was swearing a testimony so a
[53:05] lifted hand church when we raise our
[53:08] hands we're saying that the testimony of
[53:11] our mouth is true what are we saying
[53:14] when we worship God when you sing a song
[53:17] he looked beyond my faults and saw my
[53:20] need and your hands go up what you're
[53:22] saying is you're signifying this is true
[53:25] he really did that that means something
[53:27] to me and I'm going to praise him I'm
[53:29] going to worship him I'm going to extend
[53:31] my hands to the king who's worthy of all
[53:33] praise it's not just a form it's not
[53:36] just something we do cuz somebody told
[53:37] us to but that's why a song leader will
[53:39] encourage you it's why a preacher why
[53:41] brother Brandon would encourage the
[53:43] church raise your hands to him because
[53:45] what it does is it it begins to bring an
[53:47] atmosphere of surrender and worship to
[53:50] him it signifies the statement of your
[53:53] lips is true so when you say say Amen to
[53:57] the word sometimes you raise your hand
[54:00] why because a raised hand signifies it's
[54:02] nothing but the
[54:04] truth amen and when sister Hatty Wright
[54:07] said it's nothing but the truth what
[54:08] happened to her she achieved something
[54:11] no human being had ever achieved to
[54:13] speak the
[54:15] word oh my oh my I I just I just love
[54:20] this when we raise our hands in worship
[54:22] things change because praise prevails
[54:26] yeah
[54:27] remember that praise
[54:29] prevails Judah
[54:32] prevails are you with me now because we
[54:34] can't do anything for ourselves come on
[54:36] church we couldn't save ourselves we
[54:39] couldn't make ourselves Christians we
[54:40] couldn't put ourselves in the bride but
[54:43] how do we Prevail by lifting up our
[54:45] hands that's actually how we fight our
[54:48] battles yes and when you come to church
[54:51] many times people think well you know
[54:53] I'll sit here in church and I'll just
[54:54] wait on somebody to speak to me or wait
[54:57] on something to happen or or maybe we're
[54:59] sitting there with cares and worries and
[55:01] things and you wonder how am I going to
[55:03] fight this battle how am I going to
[55:05] overcome this sickness how am I going to
[55:06] overcome this financial trouble how am I
[55:08] going to ever see my kids saved and what
[55:11] you don't realize if you would just open
[55:12] up and praise the Lord and say Lord I
[55:15] believe that you're good I believe that
[55:17] you're going to take care of me I
[55:18] believe you're a Healer I believe you're
[55:20] a savior what would happen that praise
[55:22] would cause a prevailing power to come
[55:24] in your life yeah amen
[55:27] good the closest thinging that there is
[55:31] probably to a church service like what
[55:33] we have a modern church service in the
[55:35] Old Testament is found in Nehemiah
[55:38] chapter 8 when Ezra opens the book you
[55:40] remember the story he opens the book and
[55:42] before the people and he stood on a
[55:44] Pulpit the Bible said right he stood on
[55:47] a Pulpit and opened the book above the
[55:49] people and what did he do he read all
[55:51] day
[55:53] long and the people stood for the
[55:55] reading of the word which is what we do
[55:58] and he read the word and he caused him
[56:00] the Bible says to understand the sense
[56:02] and the meaning of it yeah right so he
[56:04] didn't just read but he preached right
[56:07] and but when he did it the Bible says
[56:09] Ezra opened the book all
[56:13] right Hallelujah in the sight of all the
[56:16] people for he was above all the people
[56:18] standing on the pulpit I guess the only
[56:20] person I've ever heard I would stand on
[56:22] the pulpit would be Kenny caps but I
[56:24] don't know if anybody else ever done it
[56:26] but
[56:27] but you know he stood on the pulpit but
[56:28] you know it was the pulpit would be the
[56:30] platform he was on he was up above the
[56:32] people and so he was above all the
[56:34] people when he opened all the people
[56:35] stood up and Ezra blessed the
[56:39] Lord oh I wonder if we can bless the
[56:41] Lord tonight the great God and all the
[56:44] people
[56:45] answered amen amen amen amen with what
[56:50] with lifting up their
[56:52] hands right so they answered amen and
[56:55] their body body language showed that
[56:58] they
[57:00] agreed right you know we got to be
[57:03] invested in worship you young people
[57:06] understand this like you need to be
[57:08] invested in it when the preacher
[57:10] preaching be invested in it whether you
[57:13] keep notes or whatever that you do watch
[57:15] the preacher and be invested in the
[57:16] preacher what he's saying because it
[57:18] might be something that will change your
[57:19] life might make a difference in your
[57:21] life might make a difference in what's
[57:23] going on around you might make a
[57:24] difference in school might make a
[57:26] difference and maybe the preacher
[57:28] couldn't make a difference but God could
[57:30] cause him to say something that would go
[57:32] right directly to what your need is and
[57:35] and when you're when you're in worship
[57:37] you you invest yourself in it you don't
[57:39] just I've often told preachers If You
[57:41] Preach you preach about the cross and
[57:45] you don't show any
[57:47] passion About the Passion of Christ
[57:50] nobody's going to believe you right why
[57:53] would they if it doesn't affect me why
[57:58] would it affect you on right but it's
[58:01] not just for the preacher right it ought
[58:04] to do something to us when we hear about
[58:05] Christ's death on the cross it ought to
[58:07] bring a worship from our hearts when we
[58:10] hear about it if you preach about I've
[58:12] noticed if you preach about the lamb
[58:13] taking the book and the opening of the
[58:15] word people respond to that because it's
[58:17] something he did for us that we couldn't
[58:19] do for ourselves and so there's a
[58:21] worship that goes with that there's a
[58:23] worship a time of worship that goes with
[58:25] that and so you you invest yourself in
[58:27] that you can't just sit back and say
[58:29] well I'm waiting on somebody to bless me
[58:31] well when was the last time you blessed
[58:33] the Lord Ezra blessed the Lord and all
[58:36] the people said amen amen with lifting
[58:39] up with their hands and they bowed their
[58:40] heads and worshiped the Lord with their
[58:42] faces to the ground good yes brother
[58:45] Mark I probably couldn't see hear if you
[58:47] were saying amen from back there anyway
[58:49] but I see brother Mark rais his hand I
[58:50] know what does it signify it signifies
[58:53] that that he's saying Amen to the word
[58:55] of God it means something
[58:58] church when when brother Brandon would
[59:00] speak to the
[59:02] people a and he would he would say now
[59:05] there's a sister back in the back maybe
[59:07] on the back maybe as far away maybe much
[59:09] farther because they were big dimly lit
[59:12] auditoriums full of people and many of
[59:15] them and he'd say back maybe where
[59:16] cathine sitting he said there's a lady
[59:17] sitting on the LA back on the back seat
[59:20] on the second row or whatever that it
[59:22] was and and he'd speak to her or to him
[59:25] and how many times have you heard him
[59:27] say she's going to miss it because he's
[59:29] looking for a
[59:33] response he's looking for a
[59:36] response because if and then many times
[59:39] what he do he said oh God she's going to
[59:41] miss it and then he'd say sister so and
[59:43] so yeah you call her name that get her
[59:46] attention right right and that ought to
[59:49] you know that ought to get our attention
[59:51] if somebody stood up here and called
[59:52] your name and said Brother Bruce you
[59:54] know you've struggled with a certain
[59:56] thing all these years now you're free
[59:57] from it and he called your name out like
[59:59] that what what would that do to you You'
[1:00:01] you'd respond in such a way saying Thank
[1:00:03] You Lord but shouldn't we do that to the
[1:00:05] word hasn't our name been called when
[1:00:07] the book was open isn't there a response
[1:00:10] in our heart God it's not old to me it's
[1:00:12] not something I've just heard over and
[1:00:14] over again it's not just another
[1:00:15] Wednesday night but I want to praise you
[1:00:17] I want to be like Jud I Want To Praise
[1:00:20] yes sir hey man true not how you thought
[1:00:23] the night was going to go is it
[1:00:27] but Ezra blessed the Lord and the people
[1:00:30] responded amen amen I like that but
[1:00:33] let's do it more than one amen multiple
[1:00:37] amens that's
[1:00:40] right David who was of the tribe of
[1:00:42] Judah lifted up his hands in Praise look
[1:00:46] at the scripture in Psalm
[1:00:48] 633 if if you thought this was a modern
[1:00:51] invention the way we worship is not a
[1:00:53] modern thing that's why we don't just
[1:00:56] change what we do in Worship in the
[1:00:59] sense of We Still gather together we
[1:01:01] still sing songs we still hear the
[1:01:03] preaching of the word somebody still
[1:01:05] gets up and preaches it we've been doing
[1:01:08] this for 2,000 years and then way before
[1:01:10] that God had a a method of bringing
[1:01:13] people together and a method of worship
[1:01:16] that's what he desires that's what he
[1:01:18] wants and so we don't just change that
[1:01:21] so David lifted up his hands in Praise
[1:01:24] now remember David was of the tribe of
[1:01:26] Judah Psalm 63:3 because thy loving
[1:01:28] kindness that's that's thy faithfulness
[1:01:31] is better than life my lips shall praise
[1:01:34] thee thus will I bless thee while I live
[1:01:36] I will lift up my
[1:01:38] hands in thy name so I lift up my hands
[1:01:42] he said for your faithfulness has he
[1:01:45] been faithful to you church has he been
[1:01:47] good to you he he raised his hands up he
[1:01:50] raised it up before the word he said my
[1:01:53] hands in Psalms 1948 my hands also will
[1:01:56] I lift up unto thy Commandments which I
[1:02:00] have loved come on which I have loved oh
[1:02:03] that we can fall in love with the word
[1:02:04] again as brother Stuart was speaking of
[1:02:06] Sunday night that our children would
[1:02:08] fall in love with the word and we learn
[1:02:10] we we love to read it we love to hear it
[1:02:12] again we love to study we love to talk
[1:02:15] about it my hands will I lift up to what
[1:02:18] to the word which I have loved and I
[1:02:20] will meditate in thy statutes if he
[1:02:23] could do that on Old Testament law you
[1:02:25] say well the preaching's tough for the
[1:02:27] Ben and sometimes brother brandom says
[1:02:28] things that skin my hi he was lifting it
[1:02:31] up to a law with no Grace hardly in it
[1:02:33] at all only Grace to make it another
[1:02:35] year but he still loved the word of God
[1:02:38] because it was in his heart to do
[1:02:40] it
[1:02:42] hallelujah amen raised his hands in
[1:02:45] church in Psalms 1342 you say well I do
[1:02:48] my hand raising at home I heard someone
[1:02:50] preacher years ago say I do my running
[1:02:52] at home well David ran in church danced
[1:02:54] in church and raised his hands in church
[1:02:57] he said liftt up your hands in the
[1:02:59] sanctuary and bless the
[1:03:02] Lord we talk about getting a blessing
[1:03:05] have we ever thought about being a
[1:03:07] blessing
[1:03:08] come we're not just here to to have the
[1:03:12] Lord bless us but we are here see they
[1:03:15] understood worship differently than we
[1:03:17] do they understood that when they come
[1:03:19] to the house of God that their job was
[1:03:21] not to be blessed but to be a
[1:03:24] blessing amen
[1:03:26] many times that's where our blessing
[1:03:27] comes from is when we bless the Lord he
[1:03:31] said lift up your hands he he praised
[1:03:32] God in church and out of church psalms
[1:03:34] 141:2 let my prayer be set forth before
[1:03:37] thee as incense and the lifting up of my
[1:03:40] hands as the evening
[1:03:42] sacrifice Jeremiah Jeremiah tells us let
[1:03:45] us lift up our heart with our hands unto
[1:03:49] God in the heaven s don't just do it as
[1:03:50] a show don't just do it because somebody
[1:03:53] else does it but because it's in your
[1:03:54] heart to do it that's there was
[1:03:56] something in judah's heart that caused
[1:03:59] something about that baby being born
[1:04:00] caused his mother to lift her hands to
[1:04:02] the Lord and worship there something
[1:04:04] about David or was something in his
[1:04:06] heart he wanted to worship God and I
[1:04:08] believe there's something in the heart
[1:04:09] of every born again Christian that you
[1:04:11] just can't help but you may not be an
[1:04:14] emotional person but once in a while you
[1:04:16] just can't help but raise your hands and
[1:04:18] say Lord you're good to
[1:04:20] me amen he said what about the New
[1:04:23] Testament well Paul said I will
[1:04:25] therefore
[1:04:26] and men pray everywhere lifting up holy
[1:04:29] hands without wrath and doubting yes
[1:04:33] well the brand many times gave an altar
[1:04:34] call by raising hands you think well
[1:04:37] that's nothing I've heard people even
[1:04:40] criticize that but raising hands
[1:04:44] matters a raised hand matters sir he
[1:04:47] said you know what you do when you raise
[1:04:49] your hand you defy every law of
[1:04:51] gravity you defy nature do you know that
[1:04:54] you guys know that when your your hand
[1:04:56] is not supposed to
[1:04:59] raise supposed to hang down that's the
[1:05:02] natural
[1:05:04] posture right it's for oh church for
[1:05:07] your hands to hang down but when you get
[1:05:10] in the presence of God and maybe you
[1:05:12] feel conviction about something and you
[1:05:14] raise your hand to him you say Lord I'm
[1:05:16] sorry what are you doing you're defying
[1:05:19] every law of gravity you defy nature you
[1:05:22] defy science when you raise up your hand
[1:05:24] he said when you raise your hand it
[1:05:25] shows there's a spirit in you that has
[1:05:28] come to a place that's made a decision
[1:05:31] and raise your hands toward your creator
[1:05:33] it defies scientific it defies
[1:05:35] gravitation the law of gravitation it
[1:05:38] raises the hand to accept the Creator
[1:05:41] that's able to raise it up he said
[1:05:43] that's what it means did you know you
[1:05:45] were foreshadowing the resurrection
[1:05:48] you're you're breaking the laws of
[1:05:49] gravity one day you're going to break
[1:05:51] the laws of gravity for good right but
[1:05:53] that's what you're doing every time you
[1:05:55] raise your hands in church you're
[1:05:56] breaking the law of gravity you're
[1:05:58] defying gravitation to accept the
[1:06:01] Creator that's able to raise you up good
[1:06:05] Judah
[1:06:07] prevailed he prevailed over his
[1:06:10] Brethren oh my to be the lineage of the
[1:06:14] king now I want to get and we'll get
[1:06:16] back to the praise aspect of it after a
[1:06:19] while but Christ's entire natural
[1:06:23] lineage was from Judah
[1:06:27] and it's his rights to be king that are
[1:06:30] identified in Genesis 498 Judah Thou Art
[1:06:33] he whom thy Brethren shall
[1:06:36] praise thy hand shall be in the neck of
[1:06:38] thine enemies thy father's children
[1:06:40] shall bow down before
[1:06:42] thee now we we know that Israel's first
[1:06:45] king and brother Stuart talked about it
[1:06:46] Sunday night Saul was a benjamite but
[1:06:49] God's choice was David from Bethlehem in
[1:06:52] Judah in Genesis 49 And1
[1:06:57] again Saul was the People's Choice but
[1:06:59] David was God's choice said the scepter
[1:07:01] shall not depart from Judah nor lawgiver
[1:07:04] from between his feet until Shiloh come
[1:07:07] and unto him shall the Gathering of the
[1:07:09] people be now if you look at judah's
[1:07:12] life and just him as an individual he
[1:07:14] seems like an odd
[1:07:16] choice because he married a gentile
[1:07:20] woman but the king would
[1:07:24] too yeah
[1:07:26] come on it seemed like an odd choice
[1:07:30] because marrying a gentile woman he he
[1:07:33] was a a person who you know he had
[1:07:37] trouble in his family so his sons failed
[1:07:41] to produce Offspring his first son was
[1:07:45] killed by the Lord for his wickedness
[1:07:48] that's what the Bible says doesn't tell
[1:07:50] us what it was the second son was also
[1:07:53] killed basically for being scared of
[1:07:57] dying and and for being afraid that
[1:08:00] because the way the lever the uh a
[1:08:03] marriage worked was that uh you had to
[1:08:07] take up your brother's wife because
[1:08:09] there had to be seed go on in the family
[1:08:12] so the second son was unwilling to do
[1:08:14] that and he died so Jacob only had three
[1:08:18] sons right so his third son he's like
[1:08:21] you know we got to be start being
[1:08:23] careful you ever heard the term Black
[1:08:26] Widow and not just about a a spider but
[1:08:29] a a woman that you know everybody she
[1:08:31] marries
[1:08:32] dies so a woman here his his uh his son
[1:08:37] had married a gentile woman named Tamar
[1:08:41] Tamar and she and then she was the wife
[1:08:43] of the second one and but she didn't
[1:08:46] have any children and Genesis 3811 then
[1:08:49] said Judah to Tamar's daughter-in-law
[1:08:51] remain a widow at thy father's house so
[1:08:53] he's basically saying my other son's too
[1:08:55] young
[1:08:56] he said let's pray he said Till Sheila
[1:08:58] my son be grown but he had no intention
[1:09:00] of giving her to Sheila to his other son
[1:09:03] so he was going to break what was his
[1:09:05] duty as a as a father and as a the
[1:09:09] patriarch of the family to raise up seed
[1:09:12] by her or to her to his other sons and
[1:09:15] Tamar went dwelt in her father's house
[1:09:18] now Judah failed to do it so it's a
[1:09:21] strange story but she pretends to be a
[1:09:25] harlot
[1:09:26] gets Judah to give her his staff and
[1:09:28] ring as collateral on a payment you talk
[1:09:30] about
[1:09:32] dumb I told you he you know he doesn't
[1:09:35] just seem to be a very good
[1:09:38] choice right and then the Bible says it
[1:09:42] came to pass after three about three
[1:09:44] months after it was told Judah saying
[1:09:46] Tamar thy daughter-in-law played the
[1:09:48] Harlot and she is with child by whoredom
[1:09:51] and Judah said look at that you know
[1:09:53] it's amazing what people are willing to
[1:09:55] as long as people don't know what's
[1:09:57] going on they're willing to just lay the
[1:10:00] law
[1:10:00] down Jesus said bring her forth let her
[1:10:03] be
[1:10:04] burnt she came she had the
[1:10:08] staff and his
[1:10:10] ring she said this the man who owns this
[1:10:13] is the
[1:10:16] father I told you it's a strange
[1:10:19] story she said the child is his Judah
[1:10:22] say she's more righteous than me she had
[1:10:26] twins there was something about her she
[1:10:29] she she wanted to Bear the seed she was
[1:10:32] something she had a desire for that and
[1:10:35] she had twins and because that line
[1:10:36] would become the line the lineage of
[1:10:39] Christ she had twins and when her first
[1:10:43] child broke forth it was just a hand and
[1:10:45] a midwife put a Scarlet streak around it
[1:10:48] remember to mark the
[1:10:50] firstborn brother R said because a
[1:10:52] Scarlet streak spake of redemption yes
[1:10:55] that the first son of the Virgin Mary
[1:10:58] would have the Scarlet streak of
[1:11:00] redemption oh
[1:11:02] Hallelujah so Tamar becomes one of only
[1:11:05] a few women mentioned in the lineage of
[1:11:08] Christ and I just think that's amazing
[1:11:11] you think about the grace of God that
[1:11:13] here she was a gentile woman but she had
[1:11:16] more about her than Judah even had more
[1:11:19] understanding and things and even he had
[1:11:20] that this line had to go on there was
[1:11:22] something in her that cried out for that
[1:11:25] but it doesn't speak very well of Judah
[1:11:27] at all the whole episode is a dark mark
[1:11:31] on his
[1:11:33] character but during the episode with
[1:11:35] Joseph that we've talked about
[1:11:37] extensively uh recently it was Judah
[1:11:39] began to show signs of leadership during
[1:11:42] the time that Joseph was in Egypt now
[1:11:44] you don't lead people by beating them up
[1:11:47] you don't lead people by forcing people
[1:11:50] right the the the the only way you can
[1:11:52] lead people is to get them to buy in to
[1:11:55] to what you're
[1:11:56] doing right you do that with
[1:11:59] words not with force a leader who uses
[1:12:03] force will not last very long eventually
[1:12:07] somebody's going to kill him somebody's
[1:12:09] going to be more powerful than him but a
[1:12:12] leader who uses Words which is what God
[1:12:16] uses with us and it's not a brainwashing
[1:12:19] but it's a it's it's it's a persuasion
[1:12:23] it's a leadership that comes from uh him
[1:12:26] speaking to us listen faith comes by
[1:12:29] hearing hearing the word of God and so
[1:12:31] you find Judah begins to speak and he
[1:12:34] begins to negotiate you'll find in
[1:12:35] Genesis 438 it's Judah who changes his
[1:12:38] father's mind about sending Benjamin to
[1:12:41] Egypt it's Judah who's the one who's
[1:12:43] negotiating with Joseph and you find him
[1:12:46] I believe it's in chapter 49 and he
[1:12:48] begins to negotiate with him and when he
[1:12:50] does all of a sudden it's actually in
[1:12:52] chapter 45 or 46 and he he begins to
[1:12:55] negotiate with him and all of a sudden
[1:12:57] Joseph can't take it no more yeah cuz
[1:13:00] judah's telling him we've done wrong we
[1:13:02] messed up all right and immediately oh
[1:13:07] my immediately Joseph takes puts
[1:13:09] everybody out of the palace you remember
[1:13:10] the story and he cries out to him he
[1:13:12] says I'm your brother sir amen I'm your
[1:13:17] brother but it was Judah who begin to
[1:13:19] show a leadership in fact during that
[1:13:21] time it says Judah and his Brethren so
[1:13:24] he had already begin to take on that
[1:13:27] that that that Manel of leadership among
[1:13:29] his Brethren he prevailed now in
[1:13:33] Deuteronomy 33:7 he prevailed by his
[1:13:36] voice listen to this he said this is the
[1:13:38] blessing of Judah this is Moses blessing
[1:13:41] on Judah on the tribe of Judah he said
[1:13:44] hear Lord the voice of Judah and bring
[1:13:48] him to his people let his hands be
[1:13:51] sufficient for him be thou in help to
[1:13:53] him from his in enemies so he doesn't
[1:13:57] say that much about him as he much was
[1:13:58] said about him by Jacob Moses doesn't
[1:14:01] say that much but he said Lord hear his
[1:14:03] voice I'm so glad I'm so glad that
[1:14:06] there's a voice speaking that speaks uh
[1:14:10] washes Us by the water of the word even
[1:14:12] today I'm glad that there's somebody
[1:14:14] negotiating on our behalf and it's the
[1:14:16] lion of the tribe of Judah who does
[1:14:19] that judah's a lotman in the promised
[1:14:22] land would be a very rich very wealthy
[1:14:26] very kingly allotment it would be the
[1:14:28] largest one in the promised land I'm not
[1:14:31] sure if I have that map on there or not
[1:14:34] or maybe on there later and but there's
[1:14:37] a map I kind of got it spread out there
[1:14:39] but you can see Judah is the green at
[1:14:41] the bottom if you can see that far and
[1:14:43] it's actually uh the much much larger
[1:14:45] than any other uh than any other
[1:14:48] contingent or any other allotment that
[1:14:50] was given to any of the 12 sons of Jacob
[1:14:53] so you would find in in judah's Place
[1:14:56] quite literally you'd find lots of of
[1:14:58] wine lots of uh lots of grapes lots of
[1:15:02] uh milk and and it was a very rich
[1:15:04] country it's goes all the way from the
[1:15:06] south of of Jerusalem uh in Joshua 15:8
[1:15:11] says the Border went up by the Valley of
[1:15:12] the son of hen to the south side of the
[1:15:14] jebby site the same as Jerusalem and the
[1:15:17] Border went up to the top of the
[1:15:18] mountain that lith before the valley of
[1:15:20] ham Westward it sounds like a pretty
[1:15:22] good piece of land doesn't it amen
[1:15:25] sounds like it's going to be really good
[1:15:26] and really easy but Judah was given a
[1:15:29] large piece because he was able to
[1:15:34] Prevail he was given a large piece of
[1:15:36] land maybe the L it was the largest but
[1:15:39] also maybe the most difficult to take
[1:15:43] not just because it's large but because
[1:15:45] of what was in that land listen what he
[1:15:47] says he said the valley of henm Westward
[1:15:50] which is at the end of the Valley of the
[1:15:53] Giants
[1:15:55] the Valley of the Giants northward the
[1:15:58] Valley of the Giants is where the that
[1:16:00] was the area searched by the 10 spies
[1:16:03] you remember the 10 spies I hope I'm not
[1:16:05] moving too fast for you tonight but the
[1:16:07] 10 spies that went over into the land
[1:16:09] Moses sent over and or the 12 Spies
[1:16:13] rather 10 of them had an evil report two
[1:16:15] of them had a good report but they went
[1:16:17] into the land and when they did they
[1:16:19] went up to heon and they got a bunch of
[1:16:21] grapes it took two men to carry back
[1:16:24] right one bunch of grapes you talk about
[1:16:26] a land so it's literally fulfilling the
[1:16:28] prophecy to Judah but also there were
[1:16:31] giants in that same land and numbers
[1:16:35] 13:27 says they told him this is the
[1:16:38] giving their report back to Moses said
[1:16:40] we came into the land with thou sendest
[1:16:42] us and surely it floweth with milk and
[1:16:44] honey this is the fruit of it
[1:16:47] nevertheless the people be strong that
[1:16:50] dwell in the land and the cities are
[1:16:52] walled and very great moreover we saw
[1:16:54] the children of an there now brother
[1:16:55] random types that he said it was like
[1:16:57] the Pentecostals going into the promises
[1:17:00] and finding tongues yeah right cuz
[1:17:04] remember it's it's the new wine that
[1:17:05] caused them to speak in tongues the the
[1:17:08] product of the grapes so the Pentecost
[1:17:11] went in the promised land just enough to
[1:17:13] find tongues and come back and said we
[1:17:15] like the grapes but we just can't take
[1:17:18] it right we like the tongues and he said
[1:17:21] they brought back one evidence but it
[1:17:23] wasn't the evidence
[1:17:25] there was more in the land than grapes
[1:17:28] there were giants in the land that
[1:17:29] needed to be killed but they said we
[1:17:32] can't do it and so he said nevertheless
[1:17:34] the people be strong that dwell in the
[1:17:36] land the cities are walled and very
[1:17:38] great moreover we saw the children of
[1:17:40] anak there we saw
[1:17:43] giants and
[1:17:46] Caleb remember Caleb is an interesting
[1:17:49] man I don't have time to go into all
[1:17:50] this history but Caleb is adopted into
[1:17:53] the tribe of Judah so that was his land
[1:17:56] they were talking about it's his land he
[1:17:59] would have to be the one for sure that
[1:18:02] would fight for that land and so it's
[1:18:04] even more astounding that Caleb would
[1:18:07] say would say give me this piece of land
[1:18:10] because it was the most difficult piece
[1:18:12] of land there was but remember he had in
[1:18:15] him a spirit even though he was only
[1:18:18] adopted in and you and I have been
[1:18:20] adopted into the family into the tribe
[1:18:23] of Judah amen the lion of the tribe of
[1:18:25] Judah he was adopted in but yet he had a
[1:18:27] spirit about him that caused him to be
[1:18:29] stirred up to take the land why he was a
[1:18:32] prevailer he was an overcomer right sir
[1:18:35] right and that was spoken over Judah
[1:18:37] he'll Prevail he prevailed over his
[1:18:39] Brethren yes Oh my he says Caleb stealed
[1:18:44] the people and said let us go up at once
[1:18:46] and you see the leadership coming from
[1:18:48] the tribe of Judah for we are well able
[1:18:50] to overcome it he didn't say well we
[1:18:53] might be able to there's a P he said
[1:18:55] we're well able we're well a and he
[1:18:58] based that on one thing and that's that
[1:19:00] God made the promise listen to me church
[1:19:03] if you believe what God Said that trumps
[1:19:06] everything else that says anything else
[1:19:09] different if you believe what God said
[1:19:12] about your healing you'll accept that
[1:19:14] you don't have to listen to nothing the
[1:19:15] doctor says because what God Said trumps
[1:19:18] all of that why we're prevails we're
[1:19:21] Overcomers we don't just give in when we
[1:19:23] get bad news we don't just give in when
[1:19:25] it's a tough service we don't just give
[1:19:27] in but we raise our hands and we
[1:19:29] Prevail we Prevail before God why this
[1:19:32] is our tribe amen it's spiritual in a
[1:19:35] spiritual sense yes are you with me now
[1:19:38] good Hallelujah he says but the men that
[1:19:42] went up with him said we be not able to
[1:19:44] go against the people for they are
[1:19:45] stronger than we and they brought an
[1:19:47] evil report of the land where which said
[1:19:49] searching of the children of Israel
[1:19:50] saying the land which we have gone to
[1:19:52] search it is a land that eateth up the
[1:19:55] inhabitant are so in other words it's so
[1:19:57] big and so vast that we couldn't take
[1:20:01] all this land there's too
[1:20:03] much it's too
[1:20:06] deep have you ever heard that huh the
[1:20:09] the Mysteries are just just too much for
[1:20:11] us let's just stay over here on this
[1:20:13] side of Jordan and raise some
[1:20:16] cattle but it's your
[1:20:19] land are you with me now it belongs to
[1:20:22] you everything that's in the land that's
[1:20:24] where the the promises lay so we don't
[1:20:26] stay on the other side of the land
[1:20:28] eating grapes well we love the grapes we
[1:20:30] we love the Pentecostal blessings but we
[1:20:32] want to go on over into the land which
[1:20:35] is the third pole the opening of the
[1:20:36] word the Holy Ghost which is where the
[1:20:38] Holy Ghost leads us in our day are you
[1:20:41] with me now so the land that each up the
[1:20:44] inhabitant is huge all the people that
[1:20:46] we saw in it are men of a great stature
[1:20:50] and there we saw the the Giants the sons
[1:20:52] of anoch which come of the Giants and we
[1:20:54] were in our own sight as
[1:20:58] Grasshoppers and so we were in their
[1:21:02] sight but despite their evil
[1:21:05] report Caleb had a spirit in him to
[1:21:09] Prevail he just couldn't help
[1:21:12] it have you ever been there church
[1:21:15] everybody else is saying well we're
[1:21:17] we're you know everything's going bad
[1:21:18] and everything's going on come on Church
[1:21:20] it takes somebody in the family
[1:21:22] sometimes when you're having a bad day
[1:21:23] it takes somebody just just step up and
[1:21:25] say hey we can Prevail we're going to
[1:21:28] make it it's going to be okay I believe
[1:21:30] what God Said I don't believe that the
[1:21:32] doctor's report is right I don't believe
[1:21:34] that what the people are saying is right
[1:21:36] I believe what God Said I believe we can
[1:21:39] have a there's a bride without spot a
[1:21:41] wrinkle I believe I'm going to make it I
[1:21:43] believe our children are going to make
[1:21:44] it when I say I don't want to lose
[1:21:46] another generation I say that not just I
[1:21:48] don't want to lose it but we're not
[1:21:49] going to lose it why do I say it that
[1:21:51] way because we're claiming them by faith
[1:21:53] we're not going to we're not going to
[1:21:54] let them go wow we're a Caleb generation
[1:21:56] it's time to go in it's time to quit
[1:21:59] just giving in to the
[1:22:02] devil say well just soon as they turn 18
[1:22:05] they'll run out on you and go out in the
[1:22:06] world I don't believe they have to right
[1:22:08] amen I believe young men and women can
[1:22:10] stand for God you said well it wasn't
[1:22:12] done in the past well it can be done now
[1:22:15] and if they do leave there will be a
[1:22:16] place there'll be such a pull in their
[1:22:18] heart and desire that they will come
[1:22:21] back I don't believe we have to give in
[1:22:24] sir
[1:22:25] even your children that are already out
[1:22:26] of the Ark of Safety and away don't give
[1:22:29] in right don't give in say Well they're
[1:22:31] always going to be that way you know
[1:22:33] would take a miracle well his he's a
[1:22:34] miracle working God so we preached here
[1:22:37] not long ago his name is wonderful if
[1:22:40] his name is wonderful he's a miracle
[1:22:42] worker he's able to do what we're unable
[1:22:44] to
[1:22:45] do Hallelujah this isn't much of a
[1:22:48] teaching message brother Stuart I'm
[1:22:49] trying trying not to get too excited
[1:22:54] they saw the works of God the P said
[1:22:57] they saw the manifestation of the spirit
[1:22:59] the the 10 that gave the evil report
[1:23:01] they saw that they saw Great Mighty
[1:23:03] Miracles being done there in Egypt and
[1:23:05] everything and started out but it wasn't
[1:23:08] in their heart listen to me it's got to
[1:23:11] be in your heart it's got to be more
[1:23:13] than just saying it's more than just
[1:23:14] bravado but it was in Caleb's heart
[1:23:17] that's why I could say it when nobody
[1:23:18] else said it but Joshua but if Joshua
[1:23:21] said it I'll say what Joshua said yeah
[1:23:24] yeah
[1:23:25] brand said we know Joshua's a type of
[1:23:27] the Holy Ghost we went over that Joshua
[1:23:29] is a type of Christ but Joshua is a type
[1:23:31] of the end time leader as well he's a
[1:23:33] type of of brother brandom just say it
[1:23:36] that way he is he's a type of the
[1:23:37] messenger of the hour and we are he said
[1:23:40] Caleb is a type of the Bride who stays
[1:23:42] with what Joshua
[1:23:45] says so if Joshua said sir we could have
[1:23:48] we could have church in a certain way I
[1:23:50] believe it yes I don't care how many
[1:23:52] people say we can't right if Joshua said
[1:23:55] God still healed the sick I believe it
[1:23:57] because Joshua is just saying what the
[1:23:59] Bible says he just saying what Moses
[1:24:02] said amen hallelujah as I was with Moses
[1:24:06] he said I will be with you so they saw
[1:24:08] the works of God they saw the
[1:24:10] manifestation they saw all that but it
[1:24:11] wasn't in their heart they didn't
[1:24:13] overcome listen to me church it's so
[1:24:15] important we have to overcome sometimes
[1:24:18] to be here on a Wednesday night you got
[1:24:19] to overcome tiredness but that's part of
[1:24:22] being from this tribe yeah right you say
[1:24:25] well how do I know what tribe I'm from
[1:24:27] well you're of the Lion of the tribe of
[1:24:29] judah's tribe because you're his brother

[1:24:35] kinds of
[1:24:36] ways right you're his wife you're join

[1:24:42] many Brethren he just tied up all the
[1:24:44] Loose Ends you're you're related to him
[1:24:46] in almost any way
[1:24:48] possible oh church he lives within you
[1:24:51] what is it the lion of the tribe of
[1:24:52] Judah that goes and prevails

[1:25:02] lukewarmness he prevails over cooled off
[1:25:04] churches he prevails over that what does
[1:25:06] he do he always reaches out his hands to
[1:25:09] praise right glory to God
[1:25:13] prevails I don't know what you got going
[1:25:15] on in your life right now but I believe
[1:25:17] the lion of the tribe of Judah is within
[1:25:19] you and the line of the tribe of Judah
[1:25:21] prevails
[1:25:23] yes
[1:25:25] hallelujah amen brother BR said they
[1:25:27] didn't overcome speaking of the 10 they
[1:25:29] just come out so they come they were
[1:25:31] message people they come out but they
[1:25:34] didn't overcome and Jesus said they
[1:25:36] perish in the wilderness and they
[1:25:37] eternally dead every one of them is dead
[1:25:39] means Eternal separation every one of
[1:25:40] them WR it in the wilderness but there
[1:25:42] was two men Joshua and Caleb when it
[1:25:45] come to The Showdown the obstacles was
[1:25:46] so great they look like grasshopper side
[1:25:49] of them and Joshua screamed out with
[1:25:50] Caleb and said we are more than able to
[1:25:53] do it why God said so and they were
[1:25:56] Overcomers they overcome they was the
[1:25:58] ones that was privileged out of the
[1:26:00] whole group great organization of people
[1:26:03] to take the real elected bride into the
[1:26:05] promised land Joshua and Caleb in the
[1:26:07] front lines out there as two generals
[1:26:09] LED them right down to the river and
[1:26:11] crossed the river over into the promised
[1:26:13] land why they believed the word no
[1:26:16] matter what the Bible tells us every one
[1:26:17] of the other men died in fact all the
[1:26:20] men of their generation died but there
[1:26:23] was one left
[1:26:25] Caleb every other Church might die but
[1:26:27] the bridal still be in Revival what did
[1:26:30] Caleb why because he said my servant
[1:26:32] Caleb because he had another spirit with
[1:26:34] him and has followed me fully him will I
[1:26:37] bring into the land with to unto he went
[1:26:39] and his seed shall possess it his church
[1:26:43] his seed shall possess it yeah he was a
[1:26:46] gentile adopted in the family of Juda he
[1:26:48] had Faith to Prevail and overcome we've
[1:26:50] talked about it before many times but
[1:26:52] his seed would become the one who went
[1:26:54] in and founded Bethlehem and when they
[1:26:57] founded Bethlehem that Bethlehem would
[1:26:59] become the place of the birth of the
[1:27:01] lion yeah of the tribe of
[1:27:03] Judah oh
[1:27:05] church that's prevailing right there
[1:27:08] right that's prevailing he was a gentile
[1:27:11] adopted in the family of Judah but he
[1:27:13] had Faith to Prevail and
[1:27:15] overcome Joshua 14:5 the Lord commanded
[1:27:18] Moses so as the Lord commanded Moses so
[1:27:20] the children of Israel did and they
[1:27:22] divided the land and the children of
[1:27:24] Israel of Judah came to Joshua and gilar
[1:27:26] are you with me tonight you still with
[1:27:28] me and Caleb the son of jeffan of the
[1:27:31] kenite said unto him thou knowest the
[1:27:32] thing that the Lord said unto Moses the
[1:27:34] man of God concerning me and thee and
[1:27:36] Kadesh barnea 40 years old was I when
[1:27:39] Moses the servant of the Lord sent me
[1:27:41] from Kadesh barnea to spout out the land
[1:27:44] and I brought him word again as it was
[1:27:45] in my heart you know what 40 years old
[1:27:48] is not that
[1:27:50] old used to think that was old but Caleb
[1:27:53] was 40 the first time when he went to
[1:27:56] search out the land but he was 80 when
[1:27:58] he come
[1:27:59] back hallelujah amen but what did he say
[1:28:03] he said I I brought him word again as it
[1:28:06] was in my heart listen the the the
[1:28:09] seventh angel didn't come Elijah didn't
[1:28:12] come to turn our heads back he come to
[1:28:15] turn our hearts back we can't always
[1:28:17] serve God by our head It won't always
[1:28:19] make sense right it won't always make
[1:28:22] sense to be a believer It won't always
[1:28:24] make sense to deny anything that doesn't
[1:28:26] exalts itself against the word of God it
[1:28:28] won't always make sense to go to church
[1:28:30] right it won't always make sense to do
[1:28:32] what we do but what are we doing we're
[1:28:34] we're we're we're overcoming we're
[1:28:36] prevailing over the flesh over the devil
[1:28:39] what is it we've got it in our heart not
[1:28:41] our heads oh I believe there's some
[1:28:43] people here that's got it in their
[1:28:44] hearts you wouldn't be here if you
[1:28:46] didn't come on now amen my heart not my
[1:28:50] head nevertheless he said my brethren
[1:28:52] that went up with me made the heart of
[1:28:53] the people melt but I wholly followed
[1:28:56] the Lord my God Moses swear on that day
[1:29:00] saying surely the land were on thy feet
[1:29:01] of Tren shall be thine inheritance and
[1:29:04] thy children's forever because thou Hast
[1:29:06] wholly followed the Lord my God the land
[1:29:10] you searched out you can only possess
[1:29:14] what you searched and
[1:29:16] claimed you see they all went into the
[1:29:19] land they all heard the same
[1:29:21] tapes they all listened to the same
[1:29:24] message yeah come on now right they all
[1:29:27] listened but Caleb was looking for
[1:29:30] something he was looking for a home yeah
[1:29:33] he was looking for a city all right not
[1:29:36] made with hands he was looking for a
[1:29:40] place what was it he searched until he
[1:29:42] found the burial place brother BR said
[1:29:46] where job was buried and Caleb searches
[1:29:49] out the land listen to me it's important
[1:29:52] he searches out the land until he finds
[1:29:54] the
[1:29:54] Rapture the resurrection yeah he finds
[1:29:57] the place of the Resurrection he's
[1:29:59] searching out the land until he finds
[1:30:00] Hebron until he finds the place of the
[1:30:02] resur look Church of that resurrection
[1:30:05] of the Old Testament Saints look that's
[1:30:07] exactly what the bride does we're not
[1:30:09] here to find all the faults and failures
[1:30:11] we're not looking through the message to
[1:30:13] find everything that's wrong we're
[1:30:14] looking through it for a reason we got
[1:30:16] another Hill to climb we got some Giants
[1:30:19] to fight and there's a place that
[1:30:20] belongs to us we will not be happy just
[1:30:24] just believing in one God we believe in
[1:30:25] one God but we want the revelation of
[1:30:28] the Rapture down in our hearts we
[1:30:30] believe in serpent seed we believe in
[1:30:31] all of those things but we want the
[1:30:33] revelation of the Rapture and so we
[1:30:35] search it out until we find it yes one
[1:30:38] day we're changed in a moment in a
[1:30:39] twinkling of an eye I don't say that'll
[1:30:41] be a head knowledge he may not even
[1:30:42] realize he found it but he looked all
[1:30:45] around and he just said this is mine
[1:30:48] everything is mine so the Rapture is
[1:30:50] mine right Hallelujah
[1:30:54] brother B say what's the matter with
[1:30:55] Christians tonight is God give it to us
[1:30:57] but we're afraid to investigate
[1:30:58] it when you become a Christian you're an
[1:31:01] heir to every promise in the
[1:31:04] Bible every promise someone say that
[1:31:06] with me every promise I got a few more
[1:31:08] minutes just hang with me he said that's
[1:31:11] right everything that God promised is
[1:31:13] yours it's just like a great big
[1:31:17] arcade now when I say arcade I see these
[1:31:20] little ones perk
[1:31:22] up cuz they thinking arcade is something
[1:31:24] that steals your money or that you you
[1:31:27] pay $50 for tokens and you take them up
[1:31:30] there none of y'all ever been in one of
[1:31:32] those places with your kids it it's it's
[1:31:35] Casino for
[1:31:39] kids we've done it I
[1:31:42] mean you go in there you know and you
[1:31:44] swipe the card and 50 bucks 100 bucks
[1:31:47] and it's just gone and then they go to
[1:31:49] get their prizes and they get like a
[1:31:50] little plastic top or a little toilet
[1:31:53] break the little stretchy toy that
[1:31:55] breaks when you get it in the car you've
[1:31:56] all been there that's what we think of
[1:31:59] as an arcade but an arcade the way
[1:32:01] brother brand was talking about it was a
[1:32:04] a a covered Street lined with shops
[1:32:07] that's if you go look it up in the
[1:32:08] dictionary what an arcade is it's a
[1:32:10] covered Street line with shops or
[1:32:12] something like a a grocery store or
[1:32:14] maybe we a mall or perhaps a uh a
[1:32:18] Walmart or depending on where you live
[1:32:20] Dollar
[1:32:22] General and I hope you're arcade is
[1:32:24] better than Dollar
[1:32:28] General but you know how it is sometimes
[1:32:30] you're just looking for that my wife's
[1:32:32] perfectly happy with Dollar General you
[1:32:33] know she can spend just as long in there
[1:32:35] as she can in Walmart or any of the
[1:32:37] other
[1:32:37] arcades when she goes in she wants to
[1:32:40] find out what they've got she not happy
[1:32:42] with just walking through see when I go
[1:32:44] in I go in
[1:32:46] straight right head right straight to
[1:32:48] where I'm going if I'm going to
[1:32:49] Automotive in Walmart that's exactly
[1:32:51] where I'm headed I've already mentally
[1:32:54] uh decided which route to take and how
[1:32:57] busy it is at that time because I'll
[1:32:58] take a different route if it's if it's a
[1:33:00] high
[1:33:02] traffic that's true and which door to go
[1:33:05] in where to park and you go you get your
[1:33:08] stuff and you go
[1:33:10] out but Britney wants to see what
[1:33:12] belongs to her or what could potentially
[1:33:15] belong to her so brother BR was telling
[1:33:17] he said imagine you imagine somebody
[1:33:19] gave you Walmart yes sir you know what
[1:33:23] would you do with

[1:33:29] work but I just feel like looking
[1:33:32] around believe that generator is on
[1:33:34] clearance don't even matter anymore if
[1:33:36] it's not on clearance I can take that
[1:33:39] almost bought a generator the other day
[1:33:40] cuz it's on clearance I don't even know
[1:33:41] how to plug it
[1:33:43] in and I bought a shop vac the other day
[1:33:46] brother Danny he was on clearance in the
[1:33:48] middle of the aisle what was I supposed
[1:33:49] to do you know but I was headed that
[1:33:51] direction just caught my eye that's how
[1:33:53] they get me the aisle shopping right in
[1:33:55] the middle of the aisle Walmart knows
[1:33:57] what they're doing but if you knew it
[1:33:59] was yours you just go around and look
[1:34:00] for
[1:34:02] it oh Church do we realize what this
[1:34:05] message is this message is a
[1:34:08] description sir he just telling us where
[1:34:11] to find sir the promises that belong to
[1:34:14] you in the scripture yes Hallelujah we
[1:34:18] didn't know that psalms 27 belonged to
[1:34:20] us in the end time until a Prophet come
[1:34:23] by and said it's a Prelude to a Rapture
[1:34:25] oh church we didn't know what those
[1:34:27] scriptures meant but a Prophet come by
[1:34:29] and gave us the directions and showed us
[1:34:31] where to find it but it's up to you and
[1:34:33] I to look around and say that belongs to
[1:34:35] me healing belongs to me salvation
[1:34:37] belongs to
[1:34:40] me that's what that's what Caleb was
[1:34:43] doing in the land that's what that's
[1:34:45] what Jacob did that's what Judah did he
[1:34:47] prevailed he prevailed Hallelujah the I
[1:34:52] think that's what Christians ought to do
[1:34:53] do tonight find out what you got if
[1:34:55] something gets a little high up I can't
[1:34:57] reach it I'll get me a step ladder and
[1:34:58] climb up to it if something seems a
[1:35:00] little Out Of Reach he said in the Bible
[1:35:02] that God has promised I'll stay on my
[1:35:03] knees and climb Jacob's Ladder till I
[1:35:06] reach it CU it's mine God gave it to me
[1:35:08] if Divine Healing is Promised in the
[1:35:10] Bible and I'm sick I'll stay there till
[1:35:12] God gives it to me cuz it's a promise
[1:35:14] God promised I'd forsake the world he'd
[1:35:16] give me the Holy Ghost come on you that
[1:35:17] are seeking the Holy Ghost I know some
[1:35:19] of you young people want it so bad I'll
[1:35:21] stay right there till he gives it to me
[1:35:23] because he promised it if God promised
[1:35:26] listen to this to give me the desire of
[1:35:29] my
[1:35:31] heart it's not even something maybe that
[1:35:34] you need but it's something you want but
[1:35:36] it's something that's right you
[1:35:37] something that's right
[1:35:39] yeah if God promised to give me the
[1:35:42] desire of my heart and the desire of my
[1:35:44] heart is the right thing I'll stay there
[1:35:48] till God gives it because it's a
[1:35:51] promise Hallelujah
[1:35:56] Caleb said as yet I'm as strong this day
[1:35:58] as I was in the day that Moses sent me
[1:36:00] brother Danny was 5 years older than
[1:36:04] you and he stood there he said I'm young
[1:36:07] yet I can still hold a
[1:36:11] sword I can still fight a battle he says
[1:36:15] I'm as strong today as I was imagine
[1:36:17] what kind of workout regimen he had to
[1:36:19] be on to be strong for that many years
[1:36:23] but he knew he wasn't going to be in the
[1:36:24] desert forever listen to me Church we're
[1:36:26] not going to be in these bodies forever
[1:36:27] we're going home right let's go get
[1:36:30] what's
[1:36:32] ours said I'm as strong this day as I
[1:36:35] was the day that Moses sent me as my
[1:36:37] strength was then even so is my strength
[1:36:39] now for war but to go out and to come in
[1:36:41] now therefore give me this mountain
[1:36:44] whereof the Lord spake in that day for
[1:36:45] thou heardest in that day how the anacom
[1:36:47] were there that the cities were great
[1:36:49] and fence if so be the Lord will be with
[1:36:51] me then I shall be able to drive them
[1:36:53] out as the Lord said what did he do he
[1:36:56] prevailed he broke the laws of gravity
[1:36:59] right stretched out his hand and said
[1:37:01] it's mine it belongs to me oh my that's
[1:37:04] what praise is now we're coming all full
[1:37:06] circle now before we close praise is
[1:37:08] thanking God for victory before The
[1:37:12] Battle Before the battle you remember in
[1:37:16] 2 Chronicles 20 josaphat needed a
[1:37:18] miracle it says the enemy was too
[1:37:20] numerous for them way too strong for
[1:37:23] them toight fight and Jehoshaphat being
[1:37:25] a righteous man a Godly King he faced an
[1:37:27] enemy too big a son oh my a son of Judah
[1:37:32] he faced an enemy too big to defeat by
[1:37:34] natural
[1:37:35] means but what he did is he got the
[1:37:37] people in Battle Order yeah a and a
[1:37:40] prophet rose up among the people and
[1:37:42] said if you'll give this battle to the
[1:37:44] Lord he said this battle is the Lord's
[1:37:46] not yours and immediately he what he did
[1:37:50] he consulted with the people and he
[1:37:51] appointed singers come on which is an
[1:37:54] odd thing to appoint but he appointed
[1:37:56] singers and
[1:37:58] praisers hand
[1:38:01] raisers heo oh church he appointed
[1:38:05] singers and hand raisers and when they
[1:38:07] begin to sing and to praise yes the Lord
[1:38:11] set ambushments against the children of
[1:38:13] Ammon Moab and mount seir listen they'd
[1:38:15] all gathered together against the people
[1:38:17] of God just like today when all the
[1:38:19] demons out of the Euphrates River have
[1:38:21] gathered themselves against the people
[1:38:23] of God come on church we know that's
[1:38:25] happening we know what's out there we
[1:38:26] know the darkness but what do we do we
[1:38:28] raise their hands they begin to sing and
[1:38:30] to praise and the Lord set ambushments
[1:38:32] and they went down there when they got
[1:38:34] to the battlefield there was nothing but
[1:38:35] dead bodies right and all they had to do
[1:38:38] was go and collect the jewels and the
[1:38:40] riches that were found in the place
[1:38:43] where the battlefield was oh church
[1:38:45] that's what we need to do be willing to
[1:38:46] fight but fight the right way fight with
[1:38:50] our hands raised right Hallelujah good
[1:38:53] when John sees that there was no one
[1:38:56] worthy to take the book in Revelation 5
[1:38:59] he be to weep and one of the elders said
[1:39:02] to John said weep not Behold The Lion of
[1:39:05] the tribe of Judah oh my the reason why
[1:39:08] he said that the lion have the root of
[1:39:10] David hath prevailed to open the book
[1:39:14] and to loose the Seven
[1:39:16] Seals thereof his weeping was turned to
[1:39:21] praise look what happened he's standing
[1:39:24] there and and he's weeping because no
[1:39:27] one was found worthy and then the one
[1:39:30] told him said hey someone's worthy the
[1:39:33] lion is worthy the lion of the tribe of
[1:39:35] Judah is worthy and so the lion of the
[1:39:38] tribe of Judah turned his weeping into
[1:39:41] praise yeah right it turned it around
[1:39:43] now why did he do that how did he do
[1:39:45] that he did it by becoming a
[1:39:49] lamb Hallelujah when he looked he didn't
[1:39:52] see a lion
[1:39:53] what did he see he saw a
[1:39:55] lamb and depending on how you look at
[1:39:58] him when you look at him what do you see
[1:40:00] we still see a lamb we still see a
[1:40:02] redeemer but he's the lion of the tribe
[1:40:04] of Judah he prevailed by overcoming
[1:40:07] himself yes brother brandom said
[1:40:10] speaking of John he said don't be
[1:40:11] brokenhearted John don't weep for the
[1:40:14] lion of the tribe of Judah the root of
[1:40:15] Offspring from David he has prevailed
[1:40:19] Prevail means wrestle with overcome he
[1:40:22] said oh my the guard of Gethsemane who
[1:40:25] was he overcoming in the garden himself
[1:40:29] yes what will Judah Prevail over what
[1:40:33] will the people in the end time Prevail
[1:40:35] over what will we Prevail over
[1:40:39] ourselves
[1:40:41] ourselves he prevailed over himself
[1:40:45] Prevail means wrestle with and overcome
[1:40:47] oh my The Garden of Gethsemane when
[1:40:48] blood dropped down out of his face he
[1:40:50] was overcoming
[1:40:53] what did he Prevail over
[1:40:56] Giants the giant of the flesh but in
[1:41:00] doing that see Jesus killed the giant of
[1:41:04] sin and death by killing the giant of
[1:41:08] sin he killed the giant of death because
[1:41:12] then the day you eat through of that day
[1:41:14] you die he reversed the curse right took
[1:41:18] us back across the chasm I'm closing in
[1:41:20] just a minute so he reversed the curse
[1:41:23] to back across the chasm what happened
[1:41:25] he killed the giant of death what did
[1:41:28] Caleb Prevail over Giants what did David
[1:41:31] Prevail over Goliath yeah a giant yeah
[1:41:34] who come out and boasted against the
[1:41:36] people of God day after day he boasted
[1:41:39] and he said you'll never be able to
[1:41:41] whoop me but God anointed a young man to
[1:41:43] go and take that battle to the giant
[1:41:47] right oh church we don't realize how
[1:41:49] important that sermon was Sunday night
[1:41:51] that's important because we've been an
[1:41:53] anointed in our day to do something
[1:41:55] we've been not been anointed just to sit
[1:41:57] here but we've been anointed to overcome
[1:41:59] our giant what's our giant
[1:42:02] death sir are you with me now those
[1:42:05] giants represented death but they said
[1:42:07] our God Is Bigger Than death our God is
[1:42:10] able to keep us and able to overcome a
[1:42:12] giant of death Caleb died David died but
[1:42:16] when the lion of the tribe of Judah
[1:42:18] prevailed at Gethsemane he overcame the
[1:42:20] fear of death and death itself listen
[1:42:22] what he said and what did he say he said
[1:42:26] uh he said I beheld low in the midst of
[1:42:27] the throne the four beasts in the midst
[1:42:29] of the Elder stood a lamb as what as it
[1:42:31] had been slain but it's
[1:42:34] standing it has been slain but it's
[1:42:37] resurrected what does that mean he
[1:42:39] overcome by becoming a lamb he overcome
[1:42:42] the giant of death how will we overcome
[1:42:44] right and be in a Rapture in Our
[1:42:47] Generation by becoming Lambs yes right
[1:42:50] are you with me that you just chew on
[1:42:54] that for a
[1:42:55] while the lion
[1:42:57] prevailed by giving up
[1:43:01] Sir how did he Prevail church he
[1:43:04] stretched out his
[1:43:07] hand that's how he did it you want to
[1:43:10] know how to beat the problems in your
[1:43:11] life you want to know how to beat I know
[1:43:13] it's been long on a Wednesday night but
[1:43:14] just I'm fix the clothes musicians go
[1:43:16] ahead and come you know how you want to
[1:43:18] know how to Prevail over the enemy that
[1:43:19] you're facing right now on stretch out
[1:43:22] your hands sir amen Raise Up Your Hands
[1:43:25] by stretching out his hands which is the
[1:43:27] most vulnerable position that you can be
[1:43:30] in he prevailed over death it looked
[1:43:35] like he was beaten the Bible say he was
[1:43:36] a lamb who had been slain but he wasn't
[1:43:40] dead because he said I am he that liveth
[1:43:42] and was dead and behold I am alive
[1:43:45] forever more amen and have the keys of
[1:43:49] hell and of death as David prevailed
[1:43:53] over Goliath for the children of Israel
[1:43:55] Christ Jesus prevailed over sin and
[1:43:56] death for us no wonder Paul could say oh
[1:43:59] death where is thy sting oh grave where
[1:44:01] is th Victory brother Bram taught us
[1:44:02] that the bee of death left his stinger
[1:44:05] in
[1:44:06] Christ and what did John do now look how
[1:44:09] it just comes full circle when John sees
[1:44:12] the book is open just like the children
[1:44:15] of Israel did he he worshiped all Heaven
[1:44:18] heard Him worship and when he began to
[1:44:21] worship what happened he sees the book
[1:44:24] has open it's been
[1:44:25] taken and just like Caleb though he
[1:44:29] can't just rest on his Laurels he can't
[1:44:31] just watch it open but he said give me
[1:44:33] the
[1:44:34] book that is my land that's what belongs
[1:44:38] to me I went to the angel and said to
[1:44:41] him give me the little book he said take
[1:44:42] me unto me take it eat it up it shall
[1:44:44] make thy belly bitter it shall be in th
[1:44:45] mouth sweet as honey listen when he open
[1:44:48] the lamb opened the book he was the only
[1:44:50] one that could do that you realize
[1:44:52] brother brandom didn't open open the
[1:44:53] seals right the lamb opened the seals
[1:44:56] and when the seal was broke he handed it
[1:44:59] down to a prophet the seventh angel
[1:45:01] Messenger to give to us but the lamb
[1:45:04] broke the seals and the revelation of
[1:45:06] that causes us to Prevail that's what
[1:45:09] changed John's testimony from weeping to
[1:45:12] rejoicing that's why he could go and say
[1:45:14] give me the open book because he was
[1:45:16] also going to Prevail he said thou must
[1:45:18] prophesy again what did he say to Peter
[1:45:19] Thou Art Peter and Upon This Rock what
[1:45:21] the rock of Revelation I will build my
[1:45:23] church and the Gates of Hell shall not
[1:45:25] Prevail against it why did Caleb Prevail
[1:45:28] it was revealed in his heart that the
[1:45:30] word was true his heart had been turned
[1:45:32] back and we have a revelation that God
[1:45:34] keeps his word when the church brother
[1:45:36] Brown said disbelieves Satan and
[1:45:38] believes the spirit's revelation of the
[1:45:40] word the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail
[1:45:43] against her oh church again he says this
[1:45:46] Satan hates Revelation but we love it
[1:45:48] how many love it tonight with true
[1:45:50] Revelation in our lives the gat of Hell
[1:45:53] cannot Prevail against us but we will
[1:45:57] prevail over them how it's like
[1:46:02] this my hands raised I'll face my B
[1:46:05] we're trying to fight all our battles
[1:46:07] you don't need that you don't need to do
[1:46:09] that you trying to say well if this
[1:46:11] person was better that one was better
[1:46:13] that one would do his job and they would
[1:46:14] do their job don't do that it just make
[1:46:16] you a cynic and a Critic just raise your
[1:46:19] hands say Lord I believe you I worship
[1:46:22] you I love you I believe you're God I
[1:46:26] believe you have prevailed for me Lord I
[1:46:29] believe you can Prevail in my life over
[1:46:31] the flesh one day over death itself cuz
[1:46:34] he wasn't the only one that would
[1:46:36] Prevail over death but because he he
[1:46:39] prevailed as the lion of the tribe of
[1:46:41] Judah one of these days we're going to
[1:46:45] Prevail Even in our bodies we'll be
[1:46:48] turned back in a moment in a twinkling
[1:46:50] of an eye that's a hard thing to believe
[1:46:52] it's a
[1:46:53] it's a stretch of the imagination but
[1:46:56] it's absolutely the truth I want to
[1:46:58] stand there like Caleb and said give me
[1:47:00] my Mountain this is my focus this is why
[1:47:04] that's why Satan would love to get us to
[1:47:06] arguing and fussing among ourselves
[1:47:08] about different things but this is my
[1:47:10] focus give me my Mountain I'm not going
[1:47:13] to go back to another age I'm not going
[1:47:15] to go argue with somebody over something
[1:47:17] else give me my Mountain my mountain is
[1:47:19] the rapture of the church that's where
[1:47:21] I'm headed to I want to go straight
[1:47:23] there and I want to pick up my sword and
[1:47:25] fight every devil that comes my way
[1:47:27] because he already overcame for me let
[1:47:29] me Lift My
[1:47:32] Hands Church I I this is not in my notes
[1:47:35] but when brother Brandon was on the rock
[1:47:37] you remember what he did you remember
[1:47:39] when he stood there on the Rock I've
[1:47:40] been on the sword Rock he stood there
[1:47:42] stood on that place I think brother
[1:47:44] Joel's probably been there as well some
[1:47:46] of you have he stood on that place and
[1:47:48] he put his his his belly up against The
[1:47:51] Rock and he stood there and he held up
[1:47:52] his hand hands and when he did a sword
[1:47:55] struck his hand struck his lifted
[1:47:59] hands to God many times we're trying to
[1:48:02] get Revelation by our head knowledge but
[1:48:04] he just wants you to lift up your
[1:48:06] hands and the word the opening of the
[1:48:08] word struck his
[1:48:10] hands GL to
[1:48:13] God why the lion of the tribe of Judah
[1:48:16] prevailed for you what are you facing in
[1:48:18] your life what are you going through
