[5:38] welcome to our Bible study again tonight
[5:41] such a privilege to be able to do this
[5:44] for you I want to say while some of you
[5:47] are joining we've had quite a day here
[5:51] and storms last night knocked out the
[5:53] internet so we've had to deal with that
[5:56] and then had some other things going on
[5:59] and just kind of a rush today to try to
[6:01] get everything put together but I am
[6:04] happy to announce as we've told most of
[6:07] you but if you don't know that we are
[6:09] going to have church here on Sunday
[6:11] morning
[6:12] of course we'll still be subject to our
[6:15] social distancing requirements we'll
[6:17] still have to deal with some of the
[6:20] things that you know not shaking hands
[6:23] and not giving each other hugs as much
[6:25] as we'd like to do that and but I'd
[6:28] rather deal with that and at least be
[6:29] able to be together so there's signs on
[6:32] the door posted on the door of the
[6:34] church explaining what to do and the
[6:37] Deacons will help with that as well and
[6:38] and we'll do everything we can to make
[6:41] sure that everybody is able to come in
[6:43] and and sit with us and and be a part of
[6:45] the service I don't think it'll be too
[6:47] crowded so we won't probably have to
[6:50] worry about that but we do appreciate if
[6:52] you're able to come some of you haven't
[6:54] seen in almost a month and a half two
[6:57] months and so thank you for bearing with
[6:59] us during this time thank you for being
[7:01] patient with us I'm sure that we've made
[7:03] some mistakes and doing the streaming of
[7:06] some of the things that we've done and
[7:07] in trying to work it all out and getting
[7:09] as many people in here as we could some
[7:11] of you have been here every week and
[7:13] helped and thank you for your
[7:14] faithfulness and others have not been
[7:17] able to be here and so we thank you for
[7:20] understanding and allowing us to do this
[7:23] but it looks like things are loosening
[7:25] up to where we can slowly just get back
[7:27] to normal but for now at least we're
[7:29] going to be able to have Church so god
[7:31] bless you let's have a word of Prayer
[7:33] before we get started tonight Heavenly
[7:36] Father I'm so grateful to Lord to be
[7:40] able to enter in
[7:41] to the study again tonight and thankful
[7:43] for all that you do for us she was so
[7:45] good to us every day and and allow us to
[7:48] do this tonight as it was on my heart
[7:50] and I pray father that you would help us
[7:52] to continue to do what we need to do and
[7:55] help those that are in the church and
[7:57] those that are in need father I thank
[7:59] you for them I pray that each one would
[8:01] be whole would be well physically Lord
[8:04] we think of all the requests that have
[8:05] been given us during the week and I pray
[8:08] that you'd meet every one of those needs
[8:09] sorted father I know that you can and
[8:12] then that you will that you want to this
[8:14] is your desire to meet the needs of your
[8:16] children you wouldn't give your children
[8:18] a serpent or or something like that but
[8:21] you would give us what we have need of
[8:23] and we're so grateful for that today
[8:25] father we ask you for all the things
[8:27] that we have need of Lord and then we
[8:29] ask father that we could be of service
[8:31] to you in some way in our lives but you
[8:35] bless this study tonight and everything
[8:36] that we say and everything that we do
[8:38] would be for your glory we pray in Jesus
[8:41] name Amen amen
[8:44] we're gonna be going from the book of
[8:46] Corinthians again this is part four of
[8:49] our study on the book of Corinthians I
[8:52] want to review verses 17 through 25
[8:55] briefly that's what we went over last
[8:58] time in part 3 we found out that we are
[9:02] not saved by baptism alone we also found
[9:07] out that how we preach matters in other
[9:10] words the inspired preaching of the word
[9:13] still has a place in the church and but
[9:16] it's not to be done by wisdom or to
[9:19] promote a man but it's to be done to
[9:21] promote the word the word is what
[9:23] matters
[9:24] Paul says I preach Christ crucified and
[9:26] we found out that philosophers lawyers
[9:30] and mystics did not discover Christ or
[9:33] did not they searched for the truth but
[9:37] they never found the truth but the truth
[9:40] come to the world by Christ by Jesus
[9:43] Christ and so though they are smart and
[9:46] intelligent yet they don't understand
[9:49] God but God comes and tells us what's in
[9:52] his word and we believe it
[9:53] and then we found that the world has
[9:56] entertainment they're able to do that
[9:58] and Paul deals with that and in the
[10:00] entertainment of that day of great
[10:02] eloquent speakers and we could deal with
[10:05] that today in the entertainment of that
[10:07] the world has the worldly Church has the
[10:09] world has entertainment so brother
[10:12] Branham tells us give them Jesus that's
[10:14] what we have need of is Jesus tonight
[10:18] I've got Peter and Esther here helping
[10:21] me once again so thankful to them for
[10:24] doing that I was reminded as we get into
[10:27] this tonight as well that next Wednesday
[10:30] night we won't be doing this the Lord
[10:32] willing we'll be able to have live
[10:34] service next Wednesday night at seven
[10:37] o'clock it'll be at the regular time
[10:38] next Wednesday night at seven o'clock so
[10:41] if you're just joining us we're going to
[10:42] begin going live having live services
[10:44] again in-person services on Sunday
[10:47] morning and then Wednesday night at 7
[10:49] o'clock let's go back to the study the
[10:53] Corinthians 1:26 let's begin there
[10:55] tonight Corinthians 1st Corinthians 1:26
[11:03] he says for you see your calling
[11:05] brethren how that not many wise men
[11:07] after the flesh not many mighty not many
[11:11] noble are called I'm glad he said not
[11:14] many the there was a lady who was a
[11:17] noble person and she said that she was
[11:21] saved by M because he didn't say not in
[11:24] he said not many but he said not many
[11:27] not many wise men not many mighty not
[11:29] many noble are called there are
[11:32] basically three claims to aristocracy
[11:36] and and that is to be cultured to be
[11:39] powerful or to be born noble and those
[11:44] are the things that we still deal with
[11:45] today and pull dealt with those and in
[11:47] the New Testament I believe it was James
[11:49] who dealt with those or John who said
[11:51] don't have the faith with respective
[11:54] persons and so we need to we still have
[11:58] to deal with this today so if Paul says
[12:00] there were not many of you that were
[12:02] cultured many of you that were powerful
[12:05] many of you that had a noble birth
[12:07] and if you look at the same is true
[12:09] today who comes to the gospel who heard
[12:11] the message of Jesus the common people
[12:14] heard him gladly and we find today that
[12:16] the common people believe the message
[12:18] gladly but many times the cultured the
[12:20] powerful and the widows of noble birth
[12:22] have a hard time accepting the message
[12:25] of the hour and so brother Branham talks
[12:29] about that and especially as it as it
[12:31] deals with the culture those that are
[12:33] wise those that are smart if we can put
[12:35] it that way he says he said this gospel
[12:38] shall be preached he said who's gonna
[12:40] preach it God is able to take the
[12:43] ignorance God is able to rise up stones
[12:46] for children to Abraham God can do
[12:49] whatever he wants to do He is God and
[12:51] that's the way he does it
[12:53] aren't you glad he's God and we're not
[12:54] he said when he come he never called
[12:57] Caiaphas he never called one priest he
[12:59] never called one theologian he took
[13:01] fishermen herdsmen and the ignorant and
[13:04] unlearned
[13:05] the Bible said that Peter and John were
[13:07] both ignorant and unlearned but he could
[13:09] give them and work through them the
[13:11] kingdom of God and confound the eyes and
[13:14] the minds of the wise and the mighty in
[13:18] acts 4:13 is where brother Branham takes
[13:21] this from where they were they called
[13:23] them unlearned and ignorant men it says
[13:26] they marveled they took knowledge of
[13:28] them that they'd been with Jesus because
[13:29] they spoke with boldness even though
[13:32] they were unlearned and ignorant and
[13:34] they didn't understand how that could be
[13:36] that word is literally illiterate idiots
[13:41] illiterate idiots and that sounds like
[13:43] strong language but it's actually the
[13:46] language of the original Greek unlearned
[13:49] is unlettered or illiterate and the word
[13:55] for it for its we'll go back it's it's
[14:00] it unlearned and ignorant so I'm learned
[14:03] actually means unlettered or what we
[14:05] would call ignorant and ignorant is an
[14:08] ignoramus or an idiot that's actually
[14:13] where that word comes from the Greek
[14:14] word idiota so it literally could be
[14:16] translated the illiterate idiots that's
[14:19] what the world thought of them
[14:20] they thought that they didn't have
[14:22] another education they didn't have
[14:23] enough power they didn't have enough
[14:25] noble birth to be able to be the ones
[14:27] would have this message of truth and yet
[14:30] they were and I want to deal especially
[14:34] tonight with the the third thing that
[14:38] Paul talks about he talks about culture
[14:41] he talks about power he talks about the
[14:43] wise the mighty but he also talks about
[14:45] the noble and that is would be those who
[14:46] are born into a certain status and we
[14:50] have that in the message today where
[14:52] people are born into a certain status
[14:54] and we need to be careful with that I am
[14:56] myself I'm a third generation message
[14:59] believer my children are fourth
[15:00] generation message believers so this is
[15:02] dear to my heart we need to make sure
[15:04] that we don't have what brother Adam
[15:05] calls Pentecostal grandchildren so
[15:09] brother Branham deals with the the
[15:10] Pentecostal people of his day and he
[15:11] says a few years ago he said they had
[15:14] real Pentecost men and women who got
[15:15] down with the altar and paid the price
[15:17] and come through brother and lived the
[15:21] life yes sir well what did they do they
[15:24] brought their children in set them on
[15:26] the roads and dedicated them in the
[15:27] church and they were Pentecostal that's
[15:30] grandchildren and he goes on in in the
[15:34] church choosing law for grace he says
[15:35] and what do we do we bring in our
[15:37] children put them on the role and the
[15:40] sinner out there so he deals not only
[15:41] with those who are born in the church
[15:43] but even in a sinner that would come in
[15:45] he joins the Pentecostal church and we
[15:48] say oh isn't that wonderful he come to
[15:50] be Pentecostal he's a grandchild so it's
[15:53] not just those that are born in the
[15:55] church but those that come in he said
[15:57] the trouble with our Pentecostal
[16:00] movements another message perseverance
[16:01] so the trouble with our Pentecostal
[16:03] movement were getting Pentecostal
[16:05] grandchildren they come in because our
[16:07] fathers and mothers were Pentecostal we
[16:10] taken them in on the cradle roll and
[16:11] they come up without the experience and
[16:14] there they say they're Pentecostal too
[16:15] he said no sir
[16:17] God don't have grandchildren he ain't
[16:19] grandpa he's father he's not as he said
[16:24] in many places an old Dodie grandpa
[16:26] but he's father right he said if you
[16:29] ever get to heaven you'll pay the price
[16:31] like your mother did
[16:33] like your daddy did you and and brother
[16:36] branham deals with this and you can go
[16:38] read this maybe for yourself and the
[16:40] smyrnaean church age in the church age
[16:41] book but the Branham deals with this in
[16:43] a little more depth he says no age ever
[16:45] comes back no revival ever comes back he
[16:50] said it can't have the life of God in it
[16:53] by natural generation and so all the
[16:56] things that we could do by going through
[16:59] the forms of worship of making people
[17:01] message people of all the teaching that
[17:04] we could give our children is wonderful
[17:06] and I believe our children ought to be
[17:07] taught and if we teach them correctly
[17:09] then they'll be saved but yet it takes a
[17:13] regeneration from above they have to be
[17:17] saved now we believe that they will be
[17:19] saved but they have to be saved they
[17:22] have to have an experience with God he
[17:23] said it takes a regeneration from above
[17:25] he said this last stage started with the
[17:28] fires of a Pentecostal revival and they
[17:30] organized it right back now notice what
[17:33] they did and you know the reason there
[17:34] were Pentecostal grandchildren is
[17:36] because there were Pentecostal adults
[17:38] who organized we need to make sure that
[17:42] we don't organize put a period on what
[17:44] we believe to make sure that our
[17:46] children are not Pentecostal
[17:48] grandchildren he deals with this he said
[17:50] this last stage started that way instead
[17:52] of taking the word they took their own
[17:54] ideas and did just what every age has
[17:56] done listen to this substituted the
[18:00] manual for the word substituted the
[18:04] manual for the word so the manual would
[18:09] be you just this way you do this you do
[18:11] this you do that you come to church
[18:14] you're dedicated you're baptized I want
[18:17] all of those things for my children but
[18:19] I want them to have an experience with
[18:21] God where they met God on the backside
[18:23] of the desert to where they know that
[18:26] God met them and then no one could talk
[18:28] them out of that so so but the reason
[18:32] why these Pentecostal grandchildren
[18:33] existed is because the parents
[18:35] substituted the manual for the word he
[18:38] said just you step outside that manual
[18:40] and see what happens you're out brother
[18:43] in other words you get out of their
[18:44] orthodoxy whatever
[18:45] that is their Creed he said they will
[18:48] persecute you and blame it on God
[18:51] they'll say they're doing God a service
[18:55] he goes on he says how they love their
[18:58] organization he said no wonder there are
[19:00] second generation Pentecostals and since
[19:03] God doesn't have grandchildren they are
[19:04] just children of their fathers known by
[19:06] their creeds and form of worship why the
[19:09] father's organized to protect what they
[19:11] had which was something real and the
[19:13] children just become grandchildren not
[19:15] children of God so he said they're known
[19:18] by their Creed's and form of worship as
[19:20] so many today are whether that's known
[19:23] by fanaticism or known by legalism
[19:26] they're known by their Creed's and form
[19:27] of worship but we want to be known by
[19:29] being like Christ's like they were they
[19:31] were illiterate idiots but they were
[19:34] still known that they were they had been
[19:36] with Jesus because they spoke the word
[19:37] boldly and but these were known by their
[19:40] Creed's in form of worship he said they
[19:42] can talk about what used to be but they
[19:46] can't produce it all that how that makes
[19:48] my heart stirred he said once they had
[19:51] the lightning but about all that is left
[19:54] is the thunder let them talk to you
[19:56] about the glories of their movement they
[19:59] will say yes sir
[20:00] I want you to know that this is a move
[20:03] that no man started it came
[20:05] spontaneously the spirit fell all over
[20:07] the world yes sir we got what they had
[20:09] at Pentecost this was not of men but of
[20:12] God
[20:12] brother Branham says Dan why didn't they
[20:14] keep it that way why didn't they keep it
[20:17] that way because they injected Creed's
[20:20] they denominated they organized and when
[20:22] they did they died and so the children
[20:25] just become Pentecostal grandchildren in
[20:28] the efficient church age brother Branham
[20:30] continues dealing with this and excuse
[20:31] me for kind of bearing down on this and
[20:34] getting away from Corinthians just for a
[20:35] moment but it has to do with what Paul
[20:37] is talking about not many why it's not
[20:39] many cultured not many noble are not
[20:43] many mighty not many noble not many that
[20:46] are born with the with you or you can
[20:49] trace back their lineage all the way
[20:50] back and the Pharisees maybe could trace
[20:52] their lineage back as Paul could he said
[20:55] I'm of the tribe of Benjamin a Pharisee
[20:57] of the Pharisees they could trace their
[20:58] lineage back
[20:59] but he needed to be born again we may be
[21:02] able to trace our lineage back to the
[21:03] very first message believers but we
[21:05] still need to be born again
[21:07] brother Branham says salvation has not
[21:09] passed on by natural birth any more than
[21:11] is there any truth to apostolic
[21:13] succession it isn't in the word you
[21:16] start out with truly born again
[21:17] believers and when the next generation
[21:19] comes along they're no longer just plain
[21:21] Christians but they have taken a
[21:22] denominational name and they're now
[21:25] Baptist Methodist etc and he said that
[21:28] is exactly what they are - they're not
[21:30] Christians what did the people at
[21:31] Corinth do they took a denominational
[21:34] name they called themselves a Paul a
[21:36] Paulus of Christ of Peter but they were
[21:41] it was a denominational name he said
[21:43] that is exactly what they are - they are
[21:45] not Christians you have to be born of
[21:47] the will of God excuse me not the will
[21:49] of man to be saved
[21:53] first Corinthians 1:27 we'll leave that
[21:56] there but oh I want my children to be
[21:58] saved don't you want your children to be
[21:59] saved and other children of the message
[22:02] but we've got to get them to Christ and
[22:04] the way that we do that is by keeping
[22:06] the fire ourselves by our generation not
[22:10] becoming an organization by us not and
[22:13] there will be you say well every
[22:15] generation does but there's got to be
[22:17] somebody who breaks that cycle of
[22:19] revival and death there's got to be
[22:21] somebody who keeps the fire because
[22:23] we're not called to another organization
[22:25] and then another message but this is the
[22:27] end of the end there so this is a bride
[22:29] that will not fall and so I trust that
[22:31] we are a people who can keep our
[22:34] testimony and then our children will
[22:36] have their revival now first Corinthians
[22:39] 1:27 but God has chosen the foolish
[22:42] things of the world to confound the wise
[22:45] good honest chosen the weak things of
[22:47] the world to confound the things which
[22:49] are mighty so grateful for that the base
[22:54] things of the world I'm reading these
[22:56] two together because they kind of go
[22:57] together and we'll take them together
[22:59] our study base things of the world
[23:02] things which are despised if God chosen
[23:04] yea and things which are not to bring to
[23:08] nought things that are
[23:12] the God's Word version of the the Bible
[23:15] I I like the way it renders this these
[23:18] verses in 27 and 28 he says but God
[23:20] shows what the world considers nonsense
[23:23] to put wise people to shame God shows
[23:28] what the world considers weak to put
[23:30] what is strong to shame God shows what
[23:33] the world considers ordinary and what it
[23:36] despises what it considers to be nothing
[23:38] in order to destroy what it considers to
[23:43] be something God chose and and Paul uses
[23:47] that powerful phrase three times God
[23:50] chose God chose God chose because it is
[23:55] God's choosing that we are what we are
[23:57] he chose the foolish next slide the
[24:01] foolish it's the Greek word morose where
[24:04] we get our word for more on the dole the
[24:07] stupid as I said Paul uses strong
[24:09] language and the Greek he chose the weak
[24:12] the feeble and the impotent
[24:14] he chose the base the agendas the
[24:17] without Ken unknown descent and this is
[24:20] a direct contrast to the wise and the
[24:23] powerful and the the wise and the mighty
[24:26] and those of noble birth and here is the
[24:30] foolish in the weak and those of no
[24:31] birth but he confounds them he confounds
[24:36] the wise and and the mighty and those of
[24:38] noble birth because he chose those who
[24:41] would believe as Jesus said he said I
[24:45] think the father because you've hid
[24:46] these things from the wise of the wise
[24:48] and prudent and revealed them to babes
[24:50] aren't you glad to be a baby when it
[24:52] comes to those things to be able to
[24:55] learn from God to not have so much
[24:58] education that you can't learn from God
[25:00] education is wonderful but not if you
[25:01] have so much you can't learn from God
[25:03] not have so much of this world's goods
[25:06] that you can't learn from God here's a
[25:09] people he's called not many mighty not
[25:11] many noble not many powerful not many
[25:15] wise but here's a people that he's
[25:19] called to do his will and here's the
[25:22] reason why it does it verse 29 that no
[25:23] flesh should glory
[25:25] in his presence it's a powerful
[25:29] scripture but the Branham tells us that
[25:31] he won't share his glory with nobody
[25:33] this is in an absolute in 1963 he says
[25:37] I'm only telling you the truth friend
[25:39] don't let it pass by you I'm not
[25:42] claiming I'm nothing I'm your brother
[25:44] don't you paying the attention to a
[25:45] messenger you watch the message don't
[25:48] watch the messenger God will take it
[25:49] away from you he will share his glory
[25:52] with nobody that's right don't you watch
[25:54] the messenger watch the message we could
[25:57] take this two different directions there
[25:58] are those who watch the messenger to
[26:00] make him a god but there are those who
[26:02] watch the messenger to catch every
[26:03] mistake that he made and that's who he's
[26:06] talking to if you look at the context of
[26:07] it is those who would look at the it's
[26:10] mannerisms and look at how he used his
[26:12] words inappropriately sometimes and just
[26:15] didn't use the right English or
[26:16] something like that said pulpit instead
[26:18] of pulpit or whatever that it would be
[26:20] but he said don't you watch that because
[26:23] if you get to watching the messenger God
[26:26] will take it away from you he won't
[26:29] share his glory that's why he calls
[26:31] people like William Branham that's why
[26:34] he calls people like men prove it that's
[26:36] why he calls us as word of life
[26:39] Tabernacle he calls us because God won't
[26:42] share his glory with nobody he calls
[26:45] people with faults and failures to
[26:46] preach the Word of God he calls people
[26:48] that are that are empty so he can fill
[26:51] them up and give them something to say
[26:53] don't watch the messenger God will take
[26:55] it away from me he will share his glory
[26:57] with nobody that's right don't you watch
[26:59] the messenger watch the message verse 30
[27:03] he said but of him are ye in Christ
[27:07] Jesus I have this underline in my Bible
[27:09] or I've read it in the past and I
[27:11] underlined this verse because it means
[27:13] so much to me he says but of him are ye
[27:18] in Christ Jesus who of God is made unto
[27:22] us wisdom and righteousness and
[27:24] sanctification and redemption not our
[27:28] wisdom his wisdom is made to us wisdom
[27:31] not our righteousness his righteousness
[27:33] he is made unto us righteousness not our
[27:36] sanctification but his sanctification he
[27:38] made unto us sanctification we can be
[27:40] sanctified we can be justified which is
[27:43] what righteousness means we can be
[27:44] redeemed because we are of him he has
[27:49] made him unto us these things but he
[27:53] says but of him are ye that's
[27:55] interesting
[27:56] brother Branham says remember all a
[27:59] breed that ever come to God comes the
[28:02] same way so and that's gonna continue to
[28:05] the end of the Gentile dispensation my
[28:06] friends it's it doesn't stop you have to
[28:10] be born again you must be born again
[28:12] remember all Abraham a seed that ever
[28:15] come to God comes the same way not
[28:18] nothing you could do you could not save
[28:21] yourselves no more than you could take
[28:23] your bootstraps and jump over the moon
[28:25] you cannot save yourself no man ever
[28:28] sought God it's God seeking man you
[28:32] never chose me said Jesus I choose you
[28:37] verse 31 he said that according as it is
[28:41] written here's why that he put all of
[28:44] this in Christ he said according as it
[28:46] is written he that glorieth let him
[28:48] glory in the Lord that's why Paul later
[28:52] says that my strain his strength is made
[28:55] perfect in my weakness so my glory if
[28:59] I'm gonna glory he said let me glory in
[29:00] my faults because those are the places
[29:04] is the places where he became strong in
[29:07] my life he took the opportunity he
[29:09] didn't necessarily use the weakness but
[29:11] he took the opportunity the weakness
[29:13] presented to make it a strength and
[29:17] brother branham understood this that if
[29:20] we're gonna make it we're gonna make it
[29:23] by grace I think every one of us ought
[29:26] to be able to honestly say that tonight
[29:29] if we're gonna make it it's gonna be
[29:33] because of him if we have anything to be
[29:35] proud of because we're in Christ if we
[29:39] have anything to be proud of it's not
[29:40] because we're of the party of Paul or
[29:42] the party of Apollo's or the party of
[29:44] Peter
[29:44] or the party of Christ it's because we
[29:46] are in Christ so because we're a part
[29:51] the body of Christ brother Brendan says
[29:54] so when you all get over home a lot of
[29:57] you maybe said if you happen to go
[29:59] before me and you're living in your
[30:01] great big fine palace over there he said
[30:04] you hear an echo coming across the hill
[30:06] somewhere look over on the other side of
[30:09] the hill and he said you see my little
[30:10] Hut down there somewhere among the
[30:12] evergreens and I'm standing out on the
[30:14] front porch singing Amazing Grace how
[30:17] sweet the sound
[30:19] you say well praise God oh brother
[30:22] branham finally made it
[30:24] so I'll be over on the other side he
[30:27] said over there with Amazing Grace if I
[30:30] ever get there it'll be amazing grace
[30:35] His grace bought it for me and I'm going
[30:39] by His grace alone alone I'm not going
[30:44] because of a good preacher I'm not going
[30:47] because I did jump through all the hoops
[30:49] and I was baptized in a message church
[30:51] and grew up on a message Pew I'm not
[30:54] going because my daddy was a preacher or
[30:56] I'm a preacher or or I have children in
[30:59] the church whatever that it is I'm not
[31:00] going because of my natural birth I'm
[31:04] going because of Amazing Grace the same
[31:07] amazing grace that can save the worst
[31:11] sinner on the street let's remember who
[31:14] we are
[31:14] remember where we come from remember
[31:17] that God can save to the uttermost who
[31:19] can god safe God can save anyone who has
[31:22] a desire to be saved because it's by
[31:25] Amazing Grace how sweet the sound
[31:27] brother Branham said that's the way I
[31:29] trust it tonight then I know that you do
[31:32] the same I trust that we know that as
[31:36] well
[31:36] let's bow our heads together evenly
[31:40] father's were out of time for this study
[31:41] I thank you for all that you've revealed
[31:44] to me during this time and I pray father
[31:47] there would be a help in some way I know
[31:48] that it's simple and maybe not what
[31:51] people expect but I trusted it will be a
[31:54] help we've had trouble during the during
[31:57] the day but we know when we would do
[31:59] good evil is present but we know that
[32:01] you're with us and we thank you for that
[32:04] father we're going to take the
[32:06] opportunity here this weekend of the
[32:09] Lord willing if you are willing Lord to
[32:12] have Church together once again Oh what
[32:16] that means to us father we thank you for
[32:19] allowing us to do that if it be your
[32:21] will and I pray God that you would just
[32:23] move pray you would protect us for you
[32:26] to help us to be sensible and wise and
[32:28] to follow the directions that we've been
[32:31] given and to do our best to make sure
[32:33] that we have the kind of service that
[32:37] you would want us to have father I pray
[32:40] you'd help us to reach out in some way
[32:43] Lord to help may we realize that we
[32:46] needed grace to be where we're at today
[32:48] we didn't get it just by being born in
[32:51] the message but we needed the grace of
[32:52] God and I pray Heavenly Father that we
[32:56] would extend that grace to others when
[32:59] we meet someone Lord that we could offer
[33:01] them that grace they could see by our
[33:04] boldness Lord that we've been with Jesus
[33:06] we may be illiterate we may be unlearned
[33:10] but we've been with Jesus thank you for
[33:13] all that you do for us I pray you'd
[33:15] bless each one now until Sunday morning
[33:18] in Jesus name Amen
[33:20] god bless you
