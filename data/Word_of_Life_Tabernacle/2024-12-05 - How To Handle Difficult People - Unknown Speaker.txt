you've already done we love you and we thank you in Jesus name amen amen hallelujah Proverbs chapter 4 and verse 23 Proverbs 4:23 and verse 24 would be a little bit different tonight it's Wednesday night who's glad to be in the house of the Lord tonight it's good to see each and every one of you and I know I saw quite a few online watching and so we're glad to have you as well and U I know it's a digital age but there's just something about being in the presence of the Lord and it's a it's a cold day but it's warm in here and I believe the presence of the Lord is here Proverbs chapter 4 and verse 23 I want to speak tonight on how to deal with difficult people how to deal with difficult people I know that's a little bit uh strange of a title but I think it'll it'll help us if we'll just kind of dig down and look at this I think it's important to us so let's go to Proverbs 4:23 keep thy heart with with all diligence for out of it are the issues of life we find Jesus said the same thing didn't he he said out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks put away from the award mouth and perverse lips put far from Thee I pray the Lord would add his Blessing to the word you may be seated the word forward is different from forward it's f r o w a r d it is a word you'll find often in the scripture especially in Proverbs it means willful and disobedient so not just disobedient but willful and disobedient so it' be like if you had a dog actually like both of our dogs actually that if you call on them to come and they sit and and then you go to get them and they run away and you can say it's a forward dog that dog just refuses to obey just refuses to do the right things and and it's not it's not somebody who's just difficult because of their uh the situation they're in I know there's difficult people in life that it's difficult maybe uh they're a difficult person because of circumstances of life I know it would be very difficult to be married to a pastor I'll just pick on myself I know brother brandom would have been a very difficult person to be married to and and probably his wife would have had a a difficult time that doesn't mean he was a bad person but it was just a difficult situation because he was gone all the time I know it's hard sometimes we're put in difficult situations but that's not what I'm talking about tonight I'm talking about people who are difficult on purpose they there just something about them they just want to be that way and and how do you deal with somebody like that so the the word frow word the adverb frow word is an old fashioned way to describe somebody who's difficult and honory difficult and honory and it's someone who's habitually disposed to Disobedience and opposition in other words if there's a way for them to tell you no they will tell you no just just they'll they'll find some way to do it and and the basic meaning in the Hebrew there's several different Hebrew words are translated for award but they all come from the same root and it means twisted or crooked or turned aside and so it's a it's a troublemaker somebody who does it on purpose it's different from the fool there there's a there's a man or type of person in Proverbs called the fool and the fool has said in his heart there is no God and then the fool is dealt with he's just an ignorant person he's somebody who's just base and doesn't know anything doesn't care to know but the forward man is not ignorant he's the way he is because he he Delight to be that way so it's somebody who that their way is just broken they're they're perverted I don't mean in a sexual sense but in their relationships with others they're twisted and that's what that word actually means they exist to be difficult and make trouble they just love to do that now H you know if you're thinking about somebody you may have the wrong person but you might have a difficult person that you're thinking of so Proverbs 6:12 it kind of tells us a little bit more about it he said a naughty person a wicked man walketh with a forward mouth he says he winketh with his eyes he speaketh with his feet he teacheth with his fingers forwardness is in his heart it's in his heart he's a difficult man he deviseth Mischief continually he Seth Discord right so this isn't just somebody who can be difficult at times he continually just thrives on it he wants to be difficult therefore shall his Calamity come suddenly suddenly shall he be broken without remedy now God hates sowing Discord how many know that if you read on in Proverbs chapter six he said there's six things that he hateth seven that are an Abomination to him the seventh one was he that Seth Discord among the Brethren so God hates that it's not just you that hates to be around somebody like that but God actually hates that kind of person and I I I'll say this I don't want to be a person that God hates I don't want to exhibit a characteristic of something that God hates I want to be somebody who God loves who's a friend of God I can only be that by the spirit of God in my life right right so God hates sewing Discord and I know our instinct is I think I've got your attention now our instinct is to walk away from this type of person and there is is a place and a time to do that right there is a time to do that there's sometimes you just you got to go away for your own safety for your own sanity for the good of your family for the good of your Christian walk but it ought to be a last resort we should not separate from family easily we shouldn't separate from people easily you'll find usually somebody who's always separating cutting people off they there's they got problems in their own life and in their own spirit but we want to be somebody who welcomes people and who loves people and always trying to draw a bigger Circle we don't want to cut people out so we we want to draw a bigger Circle and and so here we might our Instinct might be well we'll just cut out that difficult person and you say well I just won't suffer forward people difficult people in my life well pretty soon you won't have anybody in your life because everybody's got a little bit of this in them why because we're we're uh we're human beings and we've got that Fallen nature still there so Jehovah deals with this I thought about this and I thought Brother David I thought well you know I should have like a a I should have a master's degree in difficult people you know and just the way that my life is gone and the people that I've dealt with and then I begin to look at how God has had to deal with me and how he's had to deal with all of us and and how he had to deal with the Israelites especially they were so difficult so disobedient so so hard to get along with and yet he he cared for them he he called them he knew they would be that way and he loved them anyway right and they paid for what they did but God still loved them and I think there ought to be that overarching thing in us that we still love people even if they're difficult we still care about people and reach out for people and try to help them so it's not to not deal with them but how to deal with them so Jehovah calls the Israelites forward in Deuteronomy 32 and 20 he said I'll hide my face from them I will see what their end shall be for they are a very frower generation yeah children in whom is no faith another adjective that he uses a lot is stiff neck and it kind of means the same thing stiff neck and somebody won't Bend won't listen right it just just just won't change for anybody they're setting their ways and Moses uh God told this told Moses he said I seen this people and behold it is a stiff neck people that's right would you wouldn't you hate for him to say that about us oh we want to be pliable we want to be clay in The Potter's hand but Moses agreed with him being their Pastor Moses looked at him and said he said if now I found Grace in th sight oh Lord let my Lord I pray thee go Among Us for it is a stiff neck people and pardon our iniquity and our sin and take us for thine inheritance so Moses is playing the part of a redeemer and he's saying Lord I know we're stiff necked I know we're hard to deal with I know we're difficult sometimes but Lord deal with us anyway oh I'm so glad that that's the kind of attitude that Christ had and Moses was exhibiting the spirit of Christ Hezekiah King hezeki in the Bible told the Israelites he he sent out an an official letter to the people of Israel he said don't be like your fathers yeah right in 2 Chronicles 30:8 now be not stiff necked as your fathers were but yield yourselves unto the Lord and enter into his Sanctuary oh church if we could just how many people sit out at church because they're stiff neck because they're just difficult in their nature when they can just come to the house of God and yield themselves and enter into the sanctuary he said Don't Be Stiff necked anymore enter into his Sanctuary which has Sanctified forever and serve the Lord your God that the fierceness of his wrath may turn away from you amen Steven said the same thing about the children of Israel they they hadn't lost it even these hundreds of years later in Acts 7: 51 he said you stiff necked and uncircumcised and heart and ears you do always resist the Holy Ghost as your fathers did so do ye but God kept dealing with them God kept calling to them God I say don't give up on difficult people huh right they deserve to be forgotten but he said I won't forget get you aren't you glad you serve a god like that cuz there were moments in every one of our lives for the bill when we deserve to be forgotten but God said I won't forget them I won't give up on them even though they're difficult even though they act like teenagers their whole lives you know got that laugh out of everybody Peter I'm glad you don't have that thing tonight they deserve to be forgotten but he would not forget them oh church I'm so glad for that listen what he says Zion said the Lord ha forsaken me and my Lord ha forgotten me he said can a woman forget her sucking child that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb yeah they may forget yet will I not forget thee said behold I have Graven thee upon the palms of my hands th walls are continually before me he said I see Jerusalem in my dreams I I won't for can't forget Jerusalem oh Church difficult people can still be saved he said how do you know brother B because I was saved I know that difficult people can be changed but they do need to be changed so the first thing in how we handle difficult people is make sure we're not difficult people all right right that's the first thing to do is always look at ourselves in any situation we're dealing with people and I know we just come through Thanksgiving giving so you've been around difficult people probably huh but the first step is not to be a difficult person Matthew 7:1 judge not that you be not judged for with what judgment you judge you shall be judged with what measure you meet it shall be measured to you again and why beholdest thou the moat that is in thy brother's eye but consider not the beam that is in thine own eye the imagery there is why why are you looking at a splinter and your brother when you got a log in yours right or how will thou say to thy brother let me pull out the moat or or the log out of thine own eye or the splinter out of thine own eye and behold a log of beam is in thine own eye th hypocrite First cast out the beam out of thine own eye then shalt thou See Clearly to cast out the M out of thy brother's eyes not that his Splinter doesn't need to be removed but first get rid of the log so you can see clearly you know how to deal with him we got to make sure our sticky nature is under control and the first way that we go to do that before we go to work on our family members before we go to work on the people that we go to church with before we start dealing with somebody else before we start reforming the people trying to reform them and help them we ought to work on number one right look in the mirror and that's all of us that's myself included so we are all Paul in Romans chapter 7 how many know that that's not Paul in a precon converted state but it's Paul after he has the the Holy Ghost he's still a human being Romans 7:14 we know the law is spiritual but I am carnal sold under sin for that which I do I allow not for what I would that do I not for what I hate that do I for I know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing I'm skipping down through this chapter you can read the whole thing when you have time he said for to will is present with me but how to perform that which is good I find not again he said I find that a law that when I would do good evil is present with me oh Wretched Man that I am who shall deliver me from the body of this death yes he said I thank God through Jesus Christ Our Lord so then with the mind I myself serve the law of God but with the flesh the law sin so I want to do what's right but the flesh don't always let me do what's right so we must be changed we must have a nature within us that overrides that old nature that controls it that we continually feed brother bam talks about that but the B said we cannot receive the promised son that's promised us today in these bodies that we live in these bodies are sin sir yes sir right now come on Church what is you what are you capable of In the Flesh everything anybody else is capable of because flesh is flesh right and spirit is spirit that it just it is what it is right it is sin these bodies are sin 10 and these bodies listen to me if the new birth converted your body your flesh body you would not need to have a body change right we talked about that so wasn't it wonderful to look into the word and see what how our bodies are going to be changed why do our bodies need to be changed because it's that part of us that's not saved yet that can't be saved it's going back to the dust you say it this way that serpent part that that human part that part that's mixed up that but there's a part of you that's predestined on the inside that's what's going to create its own body are you with me now and you live in a glorified body that's the body you already have is a word body a theophany body that's waiting waiting oh my on this old body to get out of the way so you can step into that one so we must be changed we we cannot receive the sun in these bodies brother Bram taught we should only listen to our five senses that would be the senses of this body when they agree with what's on the inside Faith right you you you've heard him teach the six sense is is Faith right so if the six sense is Faith so then he said unless the five sents agree with the six sense we don't listen to our five senses he said now for instance Jesus made a statement a promise the inside man says it's true the outside man reasons that it can't be true to you right right so so you acknowledge God's the Healer but when it comes time that you get sick the outside man reasons that it can't be true to you he said then ignore the outside man and accept the inside man amen right so this this is how you're dealing so this outside he's difficult he's disobedient right he he's just not we'll get to deal with the other people in a minute but let's deal with ourselves first right the outside man is just dis obedient the outside man is Prickly the outside man is sticky and it takes something on the inside that'll go in and and and change that and overcome that but you got to fight that all of your life now it says he said ignore the outside man except the Inside Man now it's the same thing that Paul is speaking of he was sold under the law to carnal sin every one of us is the same he said that's the reason we have the troubles we do married four or five times and this that all kinds of sin and adulteries and everything else he said along in our lives is because of those things we are carnal and that part must perish but then inside we're a spirit Man soul inside he said that's spith in God's word and we bring our outside body under subjection to the word by Faith by accepting what God said Oh my he said how can I take a cuber and make a grain of weed out of it it's impossible for me to do it the only way it can be is because inside that Cleber has been transmitted from a cuckle bur to a germ called wheat life he said then you bu that cockle bur and it'll produce a grain of wheat because there's been a life of wheat put in the cockle bar and the life of the cckar has been taken out but the nature of the cocko bur is still sticky and it will be someone say it will be until this new life has fully been developed out of the ground and raised up again when it comes forth then it's no more cucklebur but wheat when does that happen church at the fullness of adoption and our body change that's when it happens and if we're going around dealing in our Rel relationships and dealing with people as if well they're not perfect brother Ben why know neither are you and neither am I right right but if you go around expecting Perfection out of people guess what's going to happen you're going to be bitterly disappointed right and there's not going to be very many people that you'll be able to be around or deal with and some of those people you're going to be in heaven with why it takes that change there got to be something on the inside that makes it takes that sticky nature and controls it and one day overcomes it right right now he said it will be until this new life has been fully developed when it comes forth there's no more cuckle but weat while it's here on the earth it's still sticky he said as long as you're in this life he said you're getting going to be sticky and have a carnal nature it's going to bother you as long as you live but the inside of you you're born again when you're raised up you're in the likeness of Christ and all someone say all the sin has gone from you oh I'm looking forward to that day now I don't give you an excuse to live like the devil what does it do do it it gives you a challenge right it must be overcome for those that walk in the spirit they are the sons of God those who are led by the spirit Philippians 3:2 tells us our conversation is in heaven from whence also we look for the Savior Lord Jesus Christ who shall change our look at that word vile body change our vile body it's vile that's why knees need to be repl placed right it's a vile body I think about that word vile it's it's an interesting word it it means that it's it's a body of humiliation changes our body of humiliation oh my may be fashion like into his glorious body according to the working whereby he's able even to subdue all things unto himself so brother bandam taught us I won't spend long on this because you all know it but he taught us that we've got to we've got to to one nature over the other right and I be careful with my words here but you're feeding the nature of the good dog right and not the bad dog right as the old Indian chief said he said which one wins he said well it depends on which one she feeds the most right so and and so you uh you you got to be careful because a lot of times what happens to people and what really brings a stumbling block is when someone who professes to be a Christian and their way up here and they've been around for a long time and yet they're so difficult and and it throws a stumbling block because sometimes what happens because the holy spirit will bring you into subjection but sometimes what happens is a person gets a religious spirit right and that religious spirit just makes them feel like that they're that that that they're okay it's just enough of the message to make them feel like they're okay but they have no control over this sticky nature and so what they'll do is they'll spiritualize it now some of y'all know what I'm talking about they'll try to make it spiritual and say well it was the Lord that made me do it and it wasn't the Lord that made Moses Smite The Rock twice it wasn't the Lord that made even though God honored it yeah but it wasn't the Lord Brother BR taught us it was not the Lord that caused Elisha to to call for the bear to eat up the children right he said it was not the spirit of Christ yet God honored it because he was a prophet yeah but it was not the spirit of Christ what is that many times it's just a a religious spirit gets on people and they continue to act in a carnal way and thinking that it's the Holy Ghost listen a person who yells and throws things who is a sinner they're a sinner and they yells and throw things they'll they'll excuse themselves because it's just the way they are right this is just me right but you let that person get a religious spirit they'll still yell they'll still throw [Music] things boy it's y'all are thinking tonight they'll still yell they'll still throw things they'll still throw fits grown-ups right they got no control over their over their sticky nature the Holy Ghost has no influence over them and yet they'll call it righteous indignation or if he's a pastor he'll he'll say well it's just my job come on or if he's a Sunday school te well you know what always just kind of fit in say well it's just you know the Lord it just he just made me do that it's just that Spirit rising up in me no it's an enticing spirit is what it is brother brand taught us a religious devil is eight times worse that's right than a regular devil why because that's what Jesus said he said the house is swept out and garnish he said the devil's cast out and he goes out and wanders around he said and he comes back finds the house empty remember he comes out back and finds the house empty he comes back in he brings seven other devil so it's eight times worse right seven other Devils with him and when he gets back he comes back he said let me go back to my house right and he's worse than he was at the beginning he's just religious now right so now brother brand said always don't judge your life by how much power you have to perform Miracles we don't judge ourselves by how much knowledge you have of the word but always someone say always always judge yourselves look back and taking inventory of what kind of a fruit that the life that you presently live now is bearing oh my what is that the fruits of the spirit 1 Corinthians 13:2 Paul says though I have the gift of Prophecy and understand all Mysteries and all knowledge and though I have all Faith so that I could remove mountains and have not charity or gape love I am nothing right yeah so we must have that so first of all if you want to handle difficult people make sure you're not the difficult person how do we handle difficult people we meet people where they are and not where we wish they were Amen brother Ben that's good I tell you what the Bible tells us hope deferred maketh the heart sick but when the desire comes it's a tree of life The Sinner is a sinner right and you meet him as the sinner right you can't expect the sinner to be a saint he's not going to be and if we quit expecting people to act different ways than they've always acted right you you'd have a whole lot easier time choosing whether or not to be around that person but if every time you're around them and you just find yourself disgusted well they didn't act like a Christian well because they're not a Christian right so a sinner is a sinner the forward man the the man who just you know he he may he may be a deacon he may be a pastor he may be a he may be an evangelist but he he just never had a nature change he can't control himself he just needs the Lord right he's just that way that's the way that he is oh Lord help us not to be that way but that's the way that he is so we got to let people be what they are you can't change the person how do you deal with that the Bible says this about the way that the forward man is it says an ungodly man diggeth up evil diggeth up evil and in his lips there is as burning fire a forward man Seth Strife see he's a man who who when he or or a woman for that matter a man or a woman woman who finds out something and immediately just burns him up you got to tell it you got to tell it in a malicious way right he's got to tell it in the in the most unflattering way that he could possibly tell it a forward man Seth strife and a Whisperer separateth Chief friends why why does he so strip because he's a forward man why does the ungodly man dig up evil because he's an ungodly man a violent man entices his neighbor and leadth him into the way that is not good why does he do that he's a violent man right that's who they are now we do have a higher expectations of expectation of Christians as I said that sometimes brings a stumbling block but the brand said I never did condemn a sinner from the way he does he's a sinner he can't help it but those people who claim to be Christians and then live in sin that's the one we got to Target on you take a pig if you see a pig rooting in a manure pile that's nothing he's a pig that's his nature you'll never get a lamb there that's right if I see people dressing acting and looking like the world talking like the world using a little slaying dirty jokes entertaining smoking cigarettes going to picture shows staying home from church he said that's the world that's all the pleasure they get they don't know any better but you have tasted and know the Lord is good it's you that I'm aiming at he says right again the world just does that you don't expect them to show up you don't expect them to do the right thing if if someone always does something a certain way that that's who they are right at some point the pattern is clear and so we don't go into that expecting different but we pray for the person so they can be born again they need the Lord yes and doesn't do any good to psychoanalyze them or try to figure them out and try to try to say well if I was different maybe if I was different maybe if I was different no if you're doing all you know to do and you're serving the lord maybe the person is just a difficult person maybe that's just who they are maybe they just need more of God in their life maybe they just need God in their life period so but we got to meet them where they are if we want to help people amen see you don't you don't usually know why a person is acting the way that they are do you know that we rarely know so and and why their nature is so sticky in those particular areas Paul met people where they were so did brother brandham if you find in 1 Corinthians 9:19 he said though I be free from all men this is Paul speaking he said yet have I made myself servant unto all that I might gain the more unto the Jews I became as a Jew that I might gain the Jews to them that are under the law is under the law that I might gain them that are under the law so he said I conducted myself as if I was under the law when I was around the Jews and the most famous example of that is when Paul takes Timothy and has him circumcised as an adult even though Paul taught the Galatians not to do that but he does it because he he's trying to make peace with the PE with the people in Jerusalem he's doing his best to fit in and it doesn't end up working you you all know the story but that's they he he said to them I tried to be like I was under the law he said but that I might gain them that are under the law to them that are without law it's without law being not without law to God but under the law to Christ so he's not he's saying it's true I'm not putting on something I can act as if I'm under the law because I am under the law I'm under the law of Christ right that I might gain them that are without law to the weak became I as weak that I might gain the weak I am made all things to all men that I might by all means save some so this is the Paul the argument Paul is making he said don't let your Liberty be an offense to somebody else right because there's some things you could do maybe that they shouldn't do or maybe they've got a weak conscience and they're unable to handle your Christmas tree or your you know right are you with me now winry decoration and so all some of us can handle wintry decorations and others have a a hard time with that but but you know you don't you just don't throw it in her face that's all you can do what you do right but don't throw it in her face because to the weak became I as weak that I might gain the weak I made all things to all men that I might by all means save some and this I do for the gospel's sake that I might be partaker thereof with you now if you go on down and there's several verses in between but this is the context where Paul is talking about keeping under his body but I keep under my body and bring it into subjection I never really noticed that Brother David or put that together before but Paul is saying I I've got to fight myself in order to do this right I got to keep under my body bring it in subjection L to by any means when I preach to others I myself should be a Cast Away Paul may not have been fighting lust or or filth or wanting to go out in the world he'd overcome all of that he wasn't fighting that what was he fighting he was fighting the desire to be right all the time the desire to show him that he had Liberty to prove to him that he was right come on now huh that's so he said I keep under my body so I can be all things to all men and not be offensive a that good how do you deal with difficult people and Paul's again Paul's a got a a masters in that he's got his PhD in dealing with difficult people when Paul's at the Sanhedrin you talk about a diff a difficult body of people the Sanhedrin would have been that they were split into Republicans and de I mean s Sadducees and Pharisees right so they they were split in half and so Paul gets up in in the middle you remember he got in trouble he got in a tight spot brother brandom said when he got in that tight spot he he stood up and he said it's because I'm a Pharisee he said that's why they got me up here he said I believe in the resurrection well he did just like they did but that wasn't that wasn't a lie he was he was fitting in with them for a purpose he was using wisdom when he went to Mars Hill and he preached at Mars Hill Paul doesn't go up there and quote Moses to him he doesn't go up there and quote David and all the prophets what does he do go read the sermon on Mars Hill he goes and reasons to them from there where they're at they don't know these prophets and things but they knew their own poets he quotes their own poets to them and brings them or brings it all the way around to Christ right and and and it's a great example to us now and I don't say we should leave it's not that he purposely left it out it's just the Holy Spirit led him to do that brother brandom taught us we should serve God like we serve our wives now some of us he said serve God like you serve your wife now how is that this is a great teaching I I just love the message of the hour just so much here so he he said when I go overseas he said I go and get a gift he said I want to make sure it's handled correctly he said because if I send it back by airplanes it'll get broken he said so I buy her something and I bring it with me he said and then I go and give it to her in a certain way honey I I I got this gift for you it just means ain't that nice when you're able to do that so what are you doing you're serving your wife he said to serve God that way he said now that's the way you serve God and why do does he do it he don't do it because she would make him do it and they didn't have a contract said every time you're overseas you got to buy a certain thing and you know I felt the pressure of that before I I've bought stuff remember brother Joel when we were in Egypt buying stuff from that little gift shop in there and 2:00 in the morning you know and we had not we'd been in Egypt and not seen anything really that great we' we'd seen the the hinder parts of Egypt I guess you could say and some of the bad parts and and some of our Egyptian friends May listen to this but but they it was some of the areas we were in were really bad and we didn't go to all the gift shops and stuff and so we're searching that little thing I think everything I bought is already broke but cuz the kids have played with it and stuff but but but what were we doing we were trying to bring something home not because we had to our wives would have been happy for us to just be home after two weeks right I got home one time I believe was from Africa I got home and there was a great big sign waiting on me and they had the house all clean fixed up and and I thought my goodness I had to go out more often you know brother brother brandom had a complex with sister Ma I don't know why I'm getting into this tonight but you just bear with me brother brandom had a little bit of complex with sister m cuz he felt like she didn't want him to be home he said she's so easy about it that she just does everything for me and packs my clothes and stuff and he goes on a hunting trip and he's sitting there thinking well maybe she just doesn't love me cuz she doesn't say nothing about me being gone and sometimes I think she did say something because I found in the message brother brand said one time she told him that uh he said I love you and she said he didn't so he said we disagreed but we still get along right he was a man so but now uh we we we find that he said that's the way that we serve God he said not because well I ought to take my Bible and go down to John's house he don't know nothing about the Lord I ought to go down there but I tell you if there's any John's I'm not talking about you he don't know nothing about the Lord I ought to go down there but I tell you oh Christian life is so hard oh you don't love God you've never been born again now listen what he's saying when you love him you love to go do something for him to bring in souls to him it isn't a duty It's A Love Affair he said how I hope that goes way down to the fifth rib on the left side and anchors there and stay see it's a love affair you love to do it if you love your wife you love to do something for her he said now that kind of love you can't have that same type of love for Jesus he explains the difference in filio and agapo love he said uh it's two different things but when you divinely love Christ like you love your wife only be a greater higher level than this is down here he said don't worry he said you'll be about the father's business trying to win souls and pray for the sick and do everything you can because you love him you want to please him oh you think God I know where there's a fellow that I believe I could lead to you now watch how he tells us how to do it yeah he said way you'll go and take all your tracks and your books and your right go down there and sit him down tie him up and force him to listen to a tape Lord no that's not how we do it he said away you'll go and talk to him in a nice way cuz that's why you give your wife that gift that's right right you're doing out of love for the Lord yes right not even just so much love for the person though you have that but love for the Lord so when you go to that difficult person maybe that unsaved person which every unsaved person is difficult and every saved person has some level of difficulty in their life but you talk about a difficult person and and and going to them how do you do it you talk to them in a nice way how do you do John I want to talk to you tonight about going fishing yes now that's would be a person if they if they like fishing right yes now oh I love to fish talk fishing to him for a while talk about his chickens whatever farming he's going to do you can talk to Caleb for a while about chickens you know some people have very little chicken knowledge but some others do but now he said talk to him about his chickens or whatever farming he's going to do for a while until God opens up the way and gives you a chance to send home the gospel right here is where we get in trouble many times with our family because we get so frustrated because they're not serving God we want to just go out and make it happen right and and it's not never going to work and you all know this you you got to love them and you got to love God enough to wait for an opportunity for the right opportunity because everybody wants a glass of water on a hot day but nobody wants it in their face right so he said until God opens up the way and and gives you a chance to send home the gospel then when you win that Soul you present it before the father like I said I did the little present to my wife here father with happiness you do it because you love it not a duty but a Love or don't you want to have that kind of attitude not a duty but a love listen what Paul says charity suffereth long and His Kind charity that's a goo love envieth not charity vaunteth not itself is not puffed up does not behave itself unseemly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked thinketh no evil and that leads me to the next Point what should how should we deal with difficult people think no evil of the difficult person other words don't let your imagination run away with you the person is difficult enough without you giving them motives they don't even have they may have just had a bad day right you you young people know that sometimes your parents just had a bad day day let them have their bad day and tomorrow ask them again that's just the truth sometimes people just have a bad day and not my parents they always keep don't ever change your mind about anything okay I do my my daughter has figured that out you know and Peter has two you know they kind of they wait for the moments you know give them the benefit of the doubt he said now we we we don't want to think evil of the of a diff even a difficult person don't overthink quit quit Discerning evil intentions or or evil spirits all over the place all right like that's just not helpful yes right remember brother Bram talked about the woman he said this man said I'm going to cast that devil out of her I'm going to go to the house and just cast that devil she won't listen to me she won't serve the Lord I'm just going to go cast that devil out of her brother BR said no don't do that he said go home and tell her you love her right and do something for her give her a nice gift right he said well that's I she got a devil he said she may but you never going to get anywhere with her like that that's right right don't don't you know Devils do cause a lot of problems but what we need to recognize that many times it's just the way we're dealing with it the devil takes that opportunity yes right and then and then and then causes it to make makes it worse than what it was now if if nothing else realize it's not the person CU we believe in a God who has power over everything and over every situ you believe that tonight over every situation he's able to bring in our children he's able to touch our loved ones he's able to keep us together and keep us in Harmony and unity he's able to do that right God allows these things to happen many times like Paul and Barnabas having their conflict in the acts and getting separated but it was needful for the gospel's sake later they come back together and the Bible tells us Barnabas was a man full of the Holy Ghost and disagreed with the messenger of the hour right now what would we make him on right how would we put him out but he was a man filled with the Holy Ghost in faith the Bible says if it hadn't been for him Paul would have never even come and been what he was because Barnabas helped him in 2 Samuel 6 16 and9 we find David and I've talked to you about this before but it just fits in so perfectly here David is you remember he's he's being run out of the city by his own son and the reason that's happening is because David's done something horrible right he deserves to be run around a little bit but yet he's God's man and he's got a he's he's got he's got a heart for God and yet he's being run out of the city and he's got a man there with him and abashi the son of Zariah and and and here comes a man up along doe the Ed Edomite he comes up and he begins to curse him and throw rocks and dirt at him and he said why should this dead dog curse my Lord the king let me go over and take off his head brother JT we felt like that sometimes haven't we some of yall feel like let me you know this person's coming against the pastor throwing stones down let let me go cut off his head right and David reacts in the right way instead of encouraging them you know we don't need we don't need people to defend us what we need need is to trust God right so David what does David do David says David says King said what have I to do with you you Sons as their ass so let him curse because the Lord has said unto him curse David who shall then say wherefore hast thou done so now brother BR said watch the spirit of God and the spirit of the devil working are you still with me tonight he said if you notice he was crippled that was doing the Edomite was a he said it represents the spiritual of the people today who make fun of the truth spirit of God in Christ manifesting itself he said that was the spirit of Christ in David being rejected as a king and today when the people make fun of the people who has received the Holy Spirit trying to achieve something he said to draw Methodist and Pentecostals and Baptists and Pentecostals and Presbyterians all together as a Unity as a body of Christ and they see the spirit working and they say well look that's Pentecostal right and and because they they associate the word Pentecostal with bad people like some people do message that's right right and he said away with him I know one went off with another man's wife I know this one got drunk I know this one did this I know this one did that all that he said but they're big enough to hide their own things now we've seen that right they're big enough to hide their own things they can hide it but David was exposed why he had the spirit of Christ in him I say thank God we don't want to hide nothing we want we want to be right we want things to be right right so we want we we we want God to come and yeah we're human beings and we have our problems around the message but listen yeah don't throw rocks at it and dirt at it that puts you in the wrong group oh yeah right but that guard said shall I take the head of that dog that curse my king and watch the spirit of Christ in David let him alone yeah and I was talking recently with somebody and they said well we ought to sue these people and things and and I had that conversation with them and I kind of agreed you know because they're telling lies on brother brandom and things and I thought well maybe that would be right but then I began to read this and I thought no no let him alone maybe the Lord told him to do it huh maybe the name just get in the paper and people will see that and go looking it up and somebody be saved all right right let him alone the Lord has told him to curse me he said instead today we want to get up our Fist and fight him see chop his head off yeah get him out he don't belong to us right and that's the Temptation when somebody gets a little trouble in the church or somebody leaves and everybody just get together and band together and and crucify them huh that's not what we ought to do we ought to love the person that much more right right you want you want to go somewhere else to church I love you just as much as I ever loved you and care for you as much as there's anything I can do to help you I want to help you right are you with me now I'm not just saying that I I believe we can do that because that's what we're supposed to do it's the spirit of Christ he said let him alone the Lord has told him to curse me that little running along there throwing dirt on David he said that's what they try to do today on the spirit of Christ they're a bunch of Holy Rollers well there're a bunch of this there's nothing to them there's nothing to Divine Healing there's no such thing as Angels no such thing as prophets all those things the days of Miracles pass throwing dirt let them alone when David returned in power when he come back as the full king of Israel he said don't worry this Jesus whose Spirit we have today how many believe this acted his part out will return again in a physical body the second time in glory in power and Majesty that little dirt thrower fell on his face and begged for mercy you find that later on he said let him alone the spirit of Christ in us don't communica him let's remember that all these things has got to come to pass we've got one thing to do what do we have to do Church move on move on don't spend all your time uh fighting with that person that's difficult move on don't assume that the motives are bad move on God promised he would make everything work together for good to them that love him let's keep the discernment of spirit keep the objective right I know it's hard to hear sometimes but it's it's true he said we're here to serve God each one fellowshipping going along and serving God Paul told us he said walk worthy of the vocation wherewith you're called with all loneliness and meekness with longsuffering forbearing one another in love endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace I think this is the last one if we want to know how to deal with difficult people how should we deal with them repent quickly and forgive quickly amen quickly that's the key that's the thing I want to key in on agree with thine adversary quickly Jesus says wh while thou are in the way with him while the arguments going on because it's not always important to be right lest at any time the adversary escalate right you know what that is he he he brings it up deliver thee to the judge and and the judge delivered to thee to the officer and th'll be cast into prison now he's not telling you to compromise on the word but if it's something you can agree on agree amen quickly right or better yet many times agree to disagree right love him care for the person make sure it doesn't escalate make sure it doesn't get any worse than what it is yeah right and and and when you mark 11:25 says when you stand praying forgive when you stand praying quickly yeah right not don't wait forgive yeah if you have ought against any that but your father also which is in heaven May forgive you your trespasses I recognize I need to be forgiven so I've got to forgive right again and this is the the I realize we all fail in these things you understand I'm human too right and I want to just cut things off and just live in my own world and not deal with the person that's not what God called us to do right again there is a place where a person becomes harmful and you got to do that but that should be the last case scenario even Paul when when he talked about the man who' done such horrible things and they had to take him out from under the Fellowship of the church and excommunicate him from the church in the next letter he said bring him back in and love on him treat him right when he comes back church are we Christians or not we believe we are we're going to have to deal with difficult people let's deal with them in the right way he said brother BR said don't forget the Commandments of God to you little children love one another love everybody right or wrong sinner or Saint love them anyhow if you don't then pray God to help you cuz God loved the Sinner and the nature of God is in you if the man is wrong love him anyhow don't partake of his sins see don't partake of his sins but in sweetness not in sourness and rebuke in sweetness tell him of the hope of life that rests within you through Jesus Christ being revealed to you by the Holy Ghost I know we live in a generation I'm closing in just a few moments we live in a generation of of people who have what they call self-care and self-love and I know that it's a good intentions and people want to take care of themselves I realize that but it's it's almost antithetical to the scriptures the scriptures don't teach us to love ourselves it teaches us to love Christ what is the two Commandments that he gave us he said love God with all your soul and strength and might and body and mind and everything else and then love your neighbor as yourself right and you do have to take care of yourself sometime but it shouldn't be the overarching goal of your life well if I can't you know if the if the boss don't treat me exactly right I'll just leave and go somewhere else no you if you'll find out nobody will employ you after a while why because you become a difficult person right right and and and so many times you got to put up with people who are difficult and that's why Paul says obey your boss he said not just the good but also what word does he use the frow word the difficult boy I'm getting myself in trouble the the Bible tells us see he he died for us because he loved us not because he loved himself but he loved us and by doing that he loves himself because we're his wife right and that's the way we ought to love one another listen the Bible tells us be angry and sin not let not the sun go down upon your wrath neither give place to the devil in other words don't let don't give the devil time to make it worse yeah get over it make it right if you can't make it right forget about it amen right and move on Sometimes some things we some knots we can't untie but we can move on right and not spend the next three weeks wasting our time because when we get to the end of life we will not you know someone said when you get to the end of your life on your deathbed you'll never be thinking I wish I spent more time at the office it's also true that you're never going to be thinking I wish I spent more time arguing with people wish I'd spent a little more time L and proven I was right I've never seen anybody get down to the very end and and think like that don't give place to the devil don't give him time to make it worse deal with it I wonder how many times if we get ready to close have we been difficult with God we grieve him in some way yet the Bible tells us that his Mercy is still there for us I want to just turn it back now in a spiritual sense Jeremiah was called the weeping prophet he had seen by Vision how Jerusalem would be destroyed because of their Twisted ways their frow hearts and then watched it happen and so he just he just dripping tears I was talking about this with with my mother and Joel the other night and I was talking about Jeremiah and about Lamentations Lamentations is a heavy book very heavy there's also some great hopefulness in it some some great words in it it's a very heavy book if you read you know just very long in it you get a little bit depressed because it was a depressing situation he was in a hard in a difficult situation and uh my mother says her favorite book is Jeremiah Jeremiah was the weeping prophet but but it's very beautiful as well but in Lamentations he said this I recall to my mind so he goes through all these things that have happened in the Ci's broken up and and everybody's forsaken them and God's even forsaken them or so it seemed he said this I recall to my mind therefore I have hope it is of the Lord's mercies that we're not consumed sir because his compassions fail not they are new yeah now think about what this means every morning the Lord gets up and decides and we're dramatized obviously he doesn't get up in the morning right he doesn't go to sleep but but it's as if every morning yes sir he decides to forgive us amen and no matter what we did the day before and what happened oh Church what happened during the week and many times we can't do that for ourselves right we get all caught up and we get to thinking like well I just I've did so many bad things and I just can't I can't forgive myself but God every morning Jeremiah says today is a new day yesterday the walls were broken down yesterday everything was going wrong yesterday the enemy was coming in stealing away my family stealing Ste away all the all the gold steal away everything else but God told him he said go buy land go buy real estate in a down Market because in after 70 years the houses will be inhabited here again and he said Lord your mercies are new every morning listen it would help us in dealing with difficult people if we would let our mercies be new every day Jesus said it this way sufficient to the day is the evil thereof what if you just woke up tomorrow and decided to forget it Let It Go you'd be like the Lord his mercies are new every morning and I'm so grateful because I make mistakes every day I know we all do musicians if you'd come I like that song My Redeemer is faithful and true he's faithful every morning his mercies are new he forgives he forgives I'm so glad that he does say Lord help me to yield to your spirit so I can forgive like you forgive you kids always keep this in your heart Lord help me to be merciful I going to deal with difficult people all my life help me to be merciful with difficult people I can I can handle that myself and there may be a time when I have to take a break and and reorient myself and I recognize I'm failing in that way but as soon as I can let me go back and renew my Mercy right give them another chance because he did that for me I'm a very difficult person if you've been around the purs around Thanksgiving time you know we are a very difficult people thanks brother the trip he held up his amen sign back there he' come over Thanksgiving afternoon I don't know why but I'm just kidding every morning every morning you got to wake up and pretend it didn't happen said that's stupid no it's not God does it said to put my sins in the sea of his forgetfulness and go try again when you keep coming back like Hosea did for Gomer if you go read the book of Hosea and he said that he said I want you to marry an Unfaithful woman he said cuz that's the kind of woman I married Israel unfaithful to me said I want you to marry an Unfaithful woman he said and then she's going to leave you and she's going to she's going to leave your children she's going to take the children she's going to do all kinds of horrible things but in the end he said I want you to go love he didn't say go just take her back and treat her harshly but go love her have how do you do that how's that even possible was the spirit of Christ in Jose go back to the saave market where she was being auctioned off as a prostitute say I want you back and I'm willing to pay the price to have you in my home again to do what it takes listen we've been given a Ministry of reconciliation not a Ministry of offense yes not a Ministry of of going out and chewing everybody out but a Ministry of reconciliation let's live that every morning let our mercies be new so that we can deal with difficult people starting with ourselves have forgiveness for ourselves and for others said Lord help me to handle the difficult people in my life starting with me that be your prayer tonight heavenly father I thank you for these people Lord It's a winter night Lord just a few of
