[4:11] standing next to you tonight as we come
[4:13] together in a spirit of unity opening
[4:16] these meetings tonight let's just join
[4:18] together and let's invite the lord to
[4:20] come heavenly father
[4:22] lord as we gather here tonight on the
[4:24] first night of these meetings
[4:26] lord as i stepped into the sanctuary
[4:28] lord my mind couldn't help but go back
[4:30] to when your prophet talked about that
[4:32] day
[4:33] that you come riding into town and he
[4:35] said the heir was charged with
[4:37] expectation
[4:38] for lord the believers were there under
[4:40] expectation of god
[4:42] fulfilling a promise of his word and
[4:45] lord as i stepped in this building
[4:46] tonight i feel that same charge of
[4:48] expectation
[4:50] in the hearts of your believers tonight
[4:52] god lord we've not gathered here to see
[4:54] a man or to hear a man's idea or to feed
[4:57] from a personality the lord we've
[4:59] gathered here tonight because there is a
[5:01] deep calling to the deep and lord there
[5:03] is a deep to respond to that call and
[5:05] father as the believers have gathered
[5:07] here and they have their hands laid up
[5:09] on one another lord we know with unity
[5:11] that we can take the land we can pursue
[5:13] the enemy but father where there is
[5:15] division the house cannot stand but it
[5:17] will fall but lord we're so thankful
[5:20] tonight that we're not divided but we're
[5:22] united under the message of the hour
[5:24] lord we've got a direction and it's not
[5:26] to the left or to the right to the back
[5:28] but it's to the four lord or to possess
[5:30] our inheritance to possess our promises
[5:32] now god i pray tonight as we join our
[5:35] faith together lord may you drive out
[5:38] every spirit in this building that's
[5:39] unlike the holy spirit lord may your
[5:41] anointing open up and rain down in this
[5:44] meeting father or from the first night
[5:46] to the final service dear god or may
[5:48] there not be one service that we would
[5:50] invite you to come to that we would not
[5:52] make you welcome but may we make you
[5:54] welcome may you be the honored guest
[5:56] among us lord father for every church
[5:58] that's represented here i pray that you
[6:00] would bless him lord for every pastor
[6:02] that's represented here our brother matt
[6:04] tonight god may you bless him and his
[6:06] assembly lord the different churches
[6:08] it's your father from brother jason's in
[6:10] different areas oh god i pray that you
[6:12] have blessed them lord father may we be
[6:15] refreshed in your presence lord and
[6:17] we'll be sure to give you all the praise
[6:19] all the honor and all the glory for to
[6:21] the wonderful name of our lord and
[6:22] savior jesus christ we pray and all the
[6:26] believer says
[6:27] amen amen the book of genesis the first
[6:30] chapter
[6:32] and i want to look in the very first
[6:33] verse of genesis 1.
[6:35] the bible says
[6:37] in the beginning
[6:38] god created the heaven and the earth
[6:42] and the earth was without form and void
[6:45] and darkness was upon the face of the
[6:47] deep
[6:48] now i love this next line
[6:50] and the spirit of god moved
[6:53] upon the face of the waters program says
[6:55] waters is a type of people
[6:57] so we can actually say in the spirit of
[6:59] god moved upon the people the spirit of
[7:02] god moved upon the face of the waters i
[7:05] also want to look in one other place the
[7:06] book of matthew the 18th chapter
[7:09] i know
[7:10] you here tonight as bible believers
[7:12] could repeat this verse from heart
[7:14] but i just want to pull it here matthew
[7:16] 18 and verse number 20
[7:19] matthew 18
[7:21] and verse number 20 i was actually
[7:22] reading in the back and realized that
[7:24] this verse is actually speaking to
[7:26] worshipers so how many worshipers do we
[7:28] have here today he said here in the 20th
[7:31] verse
[7:32] for where two or three are gathered
[7:34] together in my name
[7:36] there am i
[7:38] in the midst of them
[7:40] where two or three are gathered together
[7:42] in my name
[7:44] there am i that's the i am there am i
[7:48] in the midst of them we ask the lord
[7:51] this evening to add the blessing to the
[7:52] reading of his word as you
[7:54] can be seated here this afternoon from
[7:56] those passages of scripture for just a
[7:58] few moments if i made if i take a title
[8:00] tonight i want to speak to you on
[8:01] welcoming a move of god
[8:04] welcoming a move of god i i believe
[8:06] tonight that we have come here on the
[8:08] first night of these meetings it meant
[8:10] to welcome the spirit of god into the
[8:12] midst of his church and you know a few
[8:14] days ago in prayer something just come
[8:16] to my heart that i've been thinking upon
[8:18] and it just struck my heart in prayer
[8:20] that what we think we need is one thing
[8:23] amen but what god knows we need is
[8:25] another what we think we need is one
[8:28] thing but what god knows we need is
[8:30] another now amen you may be here tonight
[8:32] thinking that you need this or thinking
[8:34] that you need that or thinking you need
[8:35] something else amen but thank god
[8:37] tonight that we know under the spirit of
[8:40] god that he is the god that knows
[8:42] everything about us and he knows what we
[8:44] need and i'll say it to you like this
[8:46] amen what we need is a move of god that
[8:49] comes from god and his word amen i find
[8:52] it like this the prophet of god will say
[8:54] in the message about 47 times he will
[8:56] use the term move of god and you'll find
[8:59] that it takes a power to start a move of
[9:01] god now we realize this amen that man
[9:04] cannot supply that power amen but god
[9:07] must supply the power in order to start
[9:09] a move of god in the message of blessing
[9:11] prophet he said a man cannot lay in the
[9:13] presence of god and a church cannot stay
[9:16] in the presence of god under repentance
[9:18] he said unless the holy spirit comes
[9:20] down and gives action and power to start
[9:23] a move of god in there among those
[9:26] people amen i want to read that to you
[9:27] again a man cannot lay in the presence
[9:30] of god and a church cannot stay in the
[9:32] presence of god under repentance unless
[9:35] the holy spirit comes down and gives
[9:37] unction and power to start a move of god
[9:40] in there among those people now amen you
[9:42] all know as well as i know that many
[9:44] people actually fear a move of god and
[9:47] the reason that they fear a move of god
[9:49] is because many moves of god have been
[9:51] turned into fanaticism they've been
[9:53] turned into personalities they've been
[9:55] turned into man's agendas amen but just
[9:57] starting off this meeting let me remove
[9:59] all doubt and say amen god still moves
[10:03] regardless of what anybody else has done
[10:05] with the move of god amen god still
[10:08] moves i happen to believe amen that god
[10:10] still moves and sings and i happen to
[10:12] believe that god amen still moves in the
[10:14] preaching of his word i believe admit
[10:16] that god still moves in prayer lines i
[10:19] believe that god amen still moves in
[10:21] testimony services i happen to believe
[10:24] amen that god still moves and we might
[10:26] as well tell that devil tonight amen he
[10:28] can throw up every hindrance he wants to
[10:30] they've been but the spirit of god is
[10:32] greater in the church and then it's ever
[10:34] been before amen because we're not here
[10:37] upon a man's idea we're not here upon a
[10:39] man's agenda amen but we have come here
[10:42] under a spiritual leadership of the
[10:44] almighty god where he said if two or
[10:46] three would gather in my name amen i
[10:49] will come down and be in their lives he
[10:51] said that i've got god on record tonight
[10:53] saying he meant that he's going to heal
[10:55] somebody here this weekend he's going to
[10:57] deliver somebody here this weekend he's
[11:00] going to give somebody the holy ghost
[11:02] amen i don't think we got to back up to
[11:04] this devil i think it's time to break
[11:06] out of church hannity i think it's time
[11:08] to break out of cults and ideas and come
[11:10] back under the power of god and let the
[11:12] spirit of god free in the church he
[11:14] meant to move once again amen i'll tell
[11:16] you what if you'll repent of that thing
[11:18] that's between you and god right now in
[11:20] a few minutes it'll be in the sea of
[11:22] forgetfulness and you'll be full of the
[11:24] dynamics of god i'm going to church
[11:26] we're not in position to fail tonight
[11:28] we're in position for revival we're in
[11:30] position for a miracle we're in position
[11:33] to see the supernatural because god
[11:35] still moves amen i still believe god
[11:38] losing altar calls and then the problem
[11:40] god said their old fashion amen they're
[11:42] out of style today amen but god still
[11:45] moves in amen whatever the devil says is
[11:47] how to style is what god still moves in
[11:50] whatever the devil says is an idea of
[11:53] the past is a reality of today and my
[11:55] god is not dead he's a living god here
[11:58] tonight he's not looking for your
[12:00] education he's looking for your soul
[12:03] he's not looking for your ability he's
[12:05] looking for somebody that'll surrender
[12:07] to it and let him come in the church in
[12:09] the power of his dynamics can you feel
[12:11] it amen the problem god said can you
[12:13] feel it he said can you feel it moving
[12:16] on you he said do you see what it is
[12:18] it's the holy ghost ain't been what
[12:20] you're feeling right now it's not the
[12:22] words of a man it's the holy ghost of
[12:24] god amen and the holy ghost here is here
[12:27] to move the father said who are you this
[12:30] morning he said who is christ jesus he
[12:32] is in you as much as you'll let him be
[12:35] he said he's pressing he's been trying
[12:37] to get into you he meant to move into
[12:40] you today and you stand off and you
[12:42] wonder and you look and you gaze and you
[12:44] hold back a little bit he said don't do
[12:47] that ain't been moved right straight
[12:49] into the kingdom of god the hour is here
[12:53] see oh i want to see him don't you how
[12:55] many wants to see him here this weekend
[12:57] he said i want to see him and i believe
[13:00] we will see him amen because he is here
[13:03] now well i might as well go ahead and
[13:05] say what the prophet said he said my
[13:07] ministry is to declare him that he is
[13:11] here and that he is coming in a corporal
[13:14] body but he is here in the form of his
[13:16] word he is here to heal us he is here to
[13:18] bless us he is here to free oh
[13:21] you may think i lost my mind but there's
[13:23] a charge in here and it's coming from
[13:25] the word and there ain't no devil got
[13:27] enough power tonight ain't meant to stop
[13:30] my god from coming into the vessel of an
[13:32] empty soul he will fill you with his
[13:34] spirit he will charge you with his
[13:36] dynamics he said if you believe you will
[13:38] see him amen then you will see him
[13:41] because he's here now
[13:44] he said his power is moving he said what
[13:46] makes him people cry and shout and go on
[13:49] what's the matter it's the holy ghost
[13:51] they've been moving in them and you all
[13:54] know that there's three realms to god
[13:56] there's god above us there's god with us
[13:58] and then there's god in us do you
[14:00] realize what a prophet said he said
[14:02] we're not just moving because god is
[14:04] above us we're not just moving because
[14:06] god is on us amen but we're moving
[14:09] because god is in us amen don't you see
[14:11] what this is this is the fulfillment of
[14:14] prophetic inquired that the move is home
[14:17] for the bride that's let's say the lord
[14:19] the moon is not coming from the outside
[14:22] it's coming from the inside it's the
[14:24] holy ghost and fire and it's set up in
[14:26] our bones tonight and it's here to
[14:28] manifest itself the holy ghost is not
[14:31] just moving on you it's not just moving
[14:33] around you he said the holy ghost is
[14:35] moving in you if you can only realize
[14:38] and embrace him embrace the holy ghost
[14:41] and believe in him and hug him into your
[14:44] bosom and live right don't do nothing
[14:46] that would hinder him say lord jesus i
[14:49] want you i want you to stand by me i'm
[14:52] going to stand by you he's pressing to
[14:54] get into you he wants him there
[14:58] goes actually what's inside of you how
[15:00] many will agree that the holy ghost
[15:02] wants in you tonight he said see what
[15:04] he's doing he is wooing to you he is
[15:07] wooing you to him all the time now how
[15:10] many can admit at times that you've been
[15:12] in services and you felt pressure you
[15:14] felt pressure on your soul you felt
[15:16] pressure around you and i say that every
[15:18] time you feel pressure it's not always
[15:21] in the negative because the prophet of
[15:23] god shows us amen he is more willing to
[15:26] do it than you are to receive it he said
[15:28] can you imagine brother bondsworth
[15:30] expressing to this ocean out here piled
[15:32] up in one tube about two foot high or
[15:35] two foot across he said what a pressure
[15:37] there would be a men trying to find one
[15:40] little crevice they meant to leak
[15:42] through he said now divide that by ten
[15:44] thousand times and you'll find the
[15:46] pressure of the holy spirit is trying to
[15:49] find that little crevice in the heart
[15:52] amen the true faith can leak into there
[15:55] and can heal you amen do you realize if
[15:57] you were a son or daughter god you've
[15:59] got a heart inside of you and inside of
[16:01] that heart is a crevice and that crevice
[16:04] was not prepared to be flu with
[16:06] denomination he was not put there to be
[16:08] full of leona see you amen but that
[16:10] crevice was put in your heart that in
[16:12] the evening time when the spirit would
[16:14] be poured out according to joel the
[16:16] second chapter there would be a heart on
[16:18] earth to receive what he was pouring out
[16:21] come on friends if he pours his spirit
[16:23] in you it'll heal your body if he pours
[16:26] your spirit in you it'll save your soul
[16:28] if he pours his spirit in you it'll free
[16:30] your mind how many can say oh god let
[16:33] your spirit find the crevice in my heart
[16:35] on the first night of these meetings and
[16:37] let the faith of god leak into my heart
[16:40] and manifest the promise of his word he
[16:43] said see god's standing there like a
[16:45] great pressure don't be afraid of that
[16:47] he said because too many are he said you
[16:49] cannot exhaust god he wants to bless you
[16:53] look at somebody next to you and say god
[16:54] wants to bless you you didn't know you
[16:56] just got me preached and i am brother
[16:58] danny god wants to bless you brother man
[17:01] god wants to bless you we're the life
[17:03] god wants to bless you turn to the
[17:05] living god god didn't bring you together
[17:07] amen to condemn you and to beat you up
[17:10] he meant that he called you together he
[17:12] meant to bless you with his shekinah
[17:14] glory he called you together to bless
[17:17] you with his anointing and to bless you
[17:18] with his power and to bless you with his
[17:20] love
[17:21] he wants to bless you he's ready he's
[17:24] pressing could you imagine taking all
[17:27] the water that's in the earth and the
[17:29] sea and piling it into one four-foot
[17:31] pipe and put it up there he said the
[17:34] pressure would be on the bottom of it
[17:36] he'd been trying to find a little
[17:38] crevice to leak its way through he said
[17:40] that's like the pressure of the holy
[17:43] spirit trying to come down on every life
[17:46] that what is moving you is the holy
[17:49] ghost see god is watching over his word
[17:52] to vindicate it because he has got to
[17:54] make it real he's got to make it act he
[17:57] said that's why you people are hungry
[18:00] for a reminder
[18:01] [Music]
[18:02] now just go ahead and help me preach for
[18:04] a second where is that hunger coming
[18:06] from tonight it's not coming because
[18:08] andrew plumber's here or any other
[18:09] preacher's here it's because there's a
[18:11] spirit they've been there's pressing at
[18:13] your soul there's a spirit that's woven
[18:16] at you and then there's a god who has
[18:18] come down to fill you with more than
[18:20] ideas and doctrines and creeds and
[18:22] progress he has come down to fill you
[18:24] with the very life of his own self he
[18:27] said see he come down to bless you amen
[18:30] he wants to bless you it's time for
[18:32] these things to be here if you ever
[18:34] believe me to know what i was talking
[18:36] about you accept that the hour is here
[18:40] now
[18:41] preach here someday somehow but a
[18:43] vindicated prophet is filling the church
[18:45] the hour for god to bless the church
[18:48] whether being is not in the future it is
[18:51] right here in prison tonight

[19:02] way and one pulling that way and one
[19:04] against the other he said how do the
[19:06] people know what to do he said that the
[19:08] pressure of the holy spirit coming down

[20:02] moving among us and it excites that born
[20:05] against spirits let me just go ahead and
[20:07] say this i am done apologizing for being
[20:09] excited in the house of god i am done
[20:12] apologizing for worshiping my god i am
[20:15] done apologizing for being what god
[20:17] called me to be listen you didn't call
[20:19] me two years ago he called me from
[20:21] before the foundation of the world i
[20:24] don't just have representation in time
[20:26] i've got representation in eternity and
[20:29] the representation in eternity is a lot
[20:31] stronger than the representation in time
[20:34] i wasn't born to be a cold horrible
[20:36] aristocratic stiff neck starchy church
[20:38] member i was born to be a son of god he
[20:41] was born to be a daughter of god ain't
[20:43] meant to manifest god in the power of
[20:45] his spirit in the age that you're living
[20:48] in amen i'll tell you this amen if
[20:50] something's not getting excited amen the
[20:52] spirit will not excite an unregenerated
[20:54] spirit
[20:56] the spirit will not excite an unborn
[20:58] against spirit but the spirit of god
[21:00] will excite a born-again spirit
[21:04] how can you be born again and not be
[21:05] excited about it
[21:07] well we might as well preach we're here
[21:09] how can some of us come out of the
[21:11] families we come out of and come out of
[21:13] the messes we come out of and come out
[21:15] the roads that we was on and the bars
[21:17] that you were sitting in and the
[21:19] churches she was bound under and god
[21:21] saved you and filled you with the holy
[21:22] ghost and revealed the greatest message
[21:25] that has ever hit the face of and we're
[21:27] not supposed to be excited i resent that
[21:29] devil in the name of jesus i am a son of
[21:32] god who has been born by the spirit of
[21:34] god i am a free born absolute son of god
[21:37] tongue talking message believer messiah
[21:40] preacher peter of our following son of
[21:42] god and there ain't no devil to back me
[21:44] off of it
[21:46] might as well clear that dead without
[21:47] the airways we've been born again by the
[21:49] spirit of god and we're excited about it
[21:54] we was on our way to hell but tonight
[21:56] we're on our way to heaven
[21:58] we was on our way to tribulation but
[22:01] because god rich and mercy revealed this
[22:03] message to us tonight we're on our way
[22:05] to the rapture
[22:07] it's the unseen force of the holy ghost
[22:10] he said it brings excitement to that
[22:12] spirit he said the power of god foams
[22:16] down through because faith cometh by
[22:18] hearing he said then the holy ghost
[22:20] takes the word and spreads it out over
[22:22] the people to catch it with the power
[22:25] that regenerated born again life amen
[22:28] something has got to cry out if the
[22:31] spirit of god takes the word to a
[22:33] regenerated spirit in a centered part of
[22:36] god he said then something has got to
[22:39] cry out do you see that you're not the
[22:41] first one to feel the mood of god in the
[22:44] book of peter the bible says that the
[22:46] prophecy came not at old time by the
[22:48] will of men amen but holy men of god
[22:51] spake as they were moved somebody say
[22:54] moved as they were moved by the holy
[22:57] ghost he said we've tried to tell you
[22:59] the bible is the word of god it's wrote
[23:02] by god himself through the lips and
[23:04] instrumentality of man he said god can
[23:07] write himself god can speak himself god
[23:10] can do what he wants to but he chose man
[23:13] to do it because the man that wrote it
[23:15] is a part of god i don't have time to
[23:17] stop here but there's a beautiful family
[23:20] right there that if you ever was the son
[23:22] of god you always was the son of god see
[23:25] that those men who were writing about
[23:27] god was not writing about something that
[23:29] they were not a part of
[23:31] are you hearing me even see the men
[23:33] wrote the bible he said now listen the
[23:35] men didn't even know what they were
[23:37] writing in their own human thinking they
[23:39] might have disagreed with it but they
[23:41] wrote it can you imagine you're sitting
[23:44] there writing they meant something and
[23:45] your own human thinking is disagreeing
[23:48] with what you're writing and you pick up
[23:50] the pen to write something else and the
[23:52] spirit moves over you and makes you
[23:54] write something that disagrees with the
[23:56] very fault that you're thinking
[23:59] glory to god the spirit will make you
[24:02] agree with the word regardless of the
[24:04] way the flesh is feeling
[24:06] and then you think that paul wanted to
[24:07] write some of the things that he was
[24:08] writing but he was not in control of
[24:11] himself because he had welcomed the
[24:13] spirit of god amen listen to me tonight
[24:15] friends amen your flesh right now don't
[24:17] want to agree with the word you're here
[24:19] amen and your spirit may be so low right
[24:21] now it don't want to agree with the
[24:23] words you're hearing amen but i come
[24:24] here to tell you tonight amen that your
[24:27] soul is more stronger than your flesh
[24:29] it's more stronger than your spirit and
[24:31] if the spirit of god is in that soul you
[24:34] may be feeling defeated but when you
[24:36] hear the word say greater is he that is
[24:38] in you and he that is in the world amen
[24:41] something will cry out because it's the
[24:43] spirit of god they've been moving upon
[24:45] that regenerated soul by the new birth
[24:48] he said men of old was moved by the holy
[24:50] ghost are you ready for this god moved
[24:52] their hands he moved their eyes in the
[24:54] missions they could say nothing but what
[24:57] they were looking at they could speak
[24:58] nothing because he had full control
[25:01] somebody say full control
[25:03] god had full control a finger amen of
[25:06] tongue of every organ of the body was in
[25:10] full sway with god no wonder the bible
[25:13] said they were gods they meant they were
[25:15] a part of god he was the fullness of god
[25:18] see that what it was it was the holy
[25:21] ghost taking control and moving in the
[25:24] body the pentagon said in the last days
[25:26] when the evening lights begin to shine
[25:28] eyes will become open and you will see
[25:31] where you are going amen that body is
[25:34] already formed listen if you're waiting
[25:36] for the forming of the body of jesus
[25:38] christ you're some 60 years too late
[25:41] because according to a prophet the body
[25:44] is already formed it is standing up on
[25:47] his feet it has taken motion it is
[25:50] moving by the holy spirit he said watch
[25:53] the same one that moved upon the
[25:54] prophets that wrote the bible it's the
[25:57] same holy ghost that is moving in a body
[26:00] filled with the holy ghost moved in the
[26:02] holy ghost and it moved you out of every
[26:05] organization every kindred every tongue
[26:08] and every people come on friends don't
[26:10] you see what i'm preaching to you i'm
[26:12] telling you the move is home for the
[26:14] bride this is not a man's mood it's not
[26:17] a church's move it's not a preacher's
[26:19] move it's the move of almighty god and
[26:22] it's come down in this generation among
[26:24] the holy ghost moved in you to move you
[26:26] out of everything that was unlike the
[26:28] word to put you in possession to move
[26:31] you amen from time into eternity
[26:36] are you hear me it's the holy ghost
[26:37] moving
[26:38] it's not a man moving it's the holy
[26:40] ghost movement it's the holy ghost
[26:42] movement among the churches amen that is
[26:44] causing the people to hunger for reality
[26:48] it's moving in the church friends it's
[26:50] more than a man it's the reality of god
[26:52] do you realize if the holy ghost becomes
[26:55] a talk among the church the prophet of
[26:57] god said that will move the church to go
[26:59] to searching to go to hungary to go to
[27:02] pulling for the realities of god i love
[27:04] these next words god is a reality
[27:09] how many believes god is a reality he
[27:11] said the gospel is a reality and can i
[27:14] tell you how god confirms his word he
[27:16] confirms it by his spirit he's been
[27:19] moving into humanity that has been born

[27:26] roadmap go the way the disciples went go

[27:30] testified i know it to be the truth he
[27:33] said signs in the last days is god
[27:36] living in a man it's god's program
[27:39] sign for the david of the last days is
[27:41] god living in a man it's god's program
[27:45] he said see god has to find somebody
[27:48] that he can trust
[27:49] somebody he can have confidence in that
[27:51] can have confidence in god a man that
[27:54] can believe him do you believe that he
[27:56] said then when he finds such a man he
[27:58] can put his confidence and his power in
[28:01] a man that will follow the road they'll
[28:03] stay right on the map they'll go right
[28:05] on till he comes to the place of power

[28:12] lead him to power are you ready for this
[28:14] and power will lead him to the promise
[28:17] and then when he gets to the promise and

[28:50] was hashtag on the backwoods of kentucky
[28:52] amen this is the mind of god it's the
[28:55] god intelligence that has come down in
[28:57] the church in the last days to find
[28:59] somebody to manifest the potentials of
[29:01] god i might as well preach i'm this
[29:03] close to it that devil don't want you to
[29:05] break through right now because he knows
[29:07] the potentials of this meeting he knows
[29:10] the potentials of what happens when
[29:12] believers get together and they begin to
[29:14] join their faith together the holy ghost
[29:16] comes down and the spirit starts moving
[29:18] and unction starts coming and a revival
[29:21] breaks out oh i say tonight god fan the
[29:24] flames god moved upon the church
[29:28] i said brother and i'm a little bit
[29:30] scared this time amen it ain't wildfire
[29:32] it's holy ghost vampire
[29:35] come on you know why god sent this
[29:37] message to you because he can trust you
[29:41] are you hearing me he can trust you he
[29:44] brought you to this now he said and it's
[29:47] a reality it's the reality of following
[29:50] the word
[29:52] do you see what it is it's the reality
[29:55] of following the truth amen see that the
[29:58] hunger for a move of god is a blessing
[30:00] the thirst for a move of god is a
[30:03] blessing the bible said blessed they
[30:04] wish to hunger and thirst after
[30:06] righteousness for they shall be filled
[30:09] that word hunger means to suffer it
[30:11] means to seek with eager desire that
[30:13] word first means of those who are said
[30:16] to thirst who painfully feel their want
[30:19] of and eagerly long for those things by
[30:22] which the soul is repressed and
[30:25] supported and strengthened then tonight
[30:28] we're not thirsting for things that will
[30:30] satisfy the flesh or will satisfy the
[30:32] spirit amen but jesus in matthew 5 was
[30:36] speaking of the soul he said those
[30:38] people that hunger and thirst for things
[30:40] that will support the soul that will
[30:42] refresh the soul amen that will
[30:44] strengthen the soul amen will be filled
[30:47] with the desire of their heart the power
[30:49] of god sit down in their heart lord they
[30:51] want to see the move of god amen and
[30:54] those that find out the devil don't do
[30:56] one thing he will do another how many
[30:58] can witness to that if the devil doesn't
[31:00] do one thing he'll do something else and
[31:02] if we don't do something else he'll do
[31:04] another thing even the problem god told
[31:06] us what he's doing amen he's trying to
[31:08] mess up something or comment something
[31:11] amen and it makes them kindly pull back
[31:13] a little bit in an amazing right when
[31:15] the breakthrough is pissing to happen is
[31:17] when the devil tries to garb up
[31:18] something right when the breakthrough is
[31:20] fixing to happen is when the devil
[31:22] starts trying to cause some little ill
[31:24] feeling to come into the meeting
[31:25] but i want to tell that devil tonight we
[31:27] are not of those that draw back unto
[31:30] perdition we are of the seat of abraham
[31:32] and we will fight that therefore we will
[31:34] not bow our needs and no spirit and give
[31:37] this meaning to the devil amen this is
[31:39] not the devil's meaning this is not the
[31:41] devil's message this is not the devil's
[31:43] service this is our message our hour our
[31:46] season our anointing the holy ghost is
[31:48] here even to break forth upon the church
[31:51] of the living god and we will not give

[31:57] good place of time one if he wants to
[32:00] find somebody that is anointed to press
[32:02] through every obstacle that he throws
[32:04] against us we will press through and we
[32:06] will overcome because we feel the holy
[32:09] ghost moving in our soul

[33:29] another dimension until the holy ghost
[33:31] comes in and refreshes our preachers and
[33:34] refreshes our young people and represses
[33:36] our singer we need a refreshing on the
[33:38] presence of god in the church of god

[34:10] think it's time to remember what it's
[34:12] like ain't meant to break out into
[34:13] another dimension and feel the power of
[34:16] the holy ghost church through your soul

[34:24] don't care
[34:25] god promised it and i'm in position to
[34:28] receive it you're in position to receive
[34:31] it

[34:55] and i heard the prophet god say what we
[34:57] need is souls lit by the flame of
[35:00] almighty god you know what dawn don't
[35:02] mean brother ben was over brother rap's
[35:04] head was not a pillar of ice it was a
[35:06] pillow tire

[35:10] william branham's head it was a fire it
[35:13] was a holy fire it was a power to burn
[35:15] out sin it was a power to burn out
[35:17] unbelievable but i want to tell you
[35:19] tonight amen that fire it's not in the
[35:21] fallen cabinet in washington dc that
[35:24] fire is in this building tonight and
[35:26] it's whirling through here and it's here
[35:28] to set you on fire it's here to break
[35:30] that full spell it's here to put you in
[35:32] action the moon is on from the ground

[35:46] somebody break that devil off somebody
[35:48] break that whole bible put it back to
[35:51] hell where it comes from we're not under
[35:53] a pillar of the house we're under a
[35:54] pillar of power
[35:59] it's a move of god and i tell you what
[36:01] happens with the move of god it starts
[36:03] when god moves in his church comes into
[36:06] his church and proves
[36:08] that he is the same yesterday
[36:10] today and forever
[36:13] can i tell you what else the word of god
[36:15] starts with it starts with people that
[36:18] settle to refuse for less than what god
[36:20] promised them
[36:22] [Music]
[36:23] tested it's still working it starts with
[36:26] people who refuse to settle for less
[36:30] than what god promised them
[36:32] they quit making bargains with the devil
[36:35] and get the full value of the full word
[36:38] in its full strength
[36:40] well i might as well preach amen you've
[36:42] been making deals with the devil and
[36:44] it's not going to work did it work last
[36:46] time did it work two years ago did it
[36:48] work 20 years ago amen that devil's a
[36:50] devil that breaks every deal he makes
[36:52] ain't been but my god said
[36:55] my god said all things are theirs they
[36:58] are the possessors of all things through
[37:01] the death of the son of god at calvary
[37:03] then come on tonight we're not going to
[37:05] be the heirs of salvation but right here
[37:07] tonight we are the heirs of salvation we
[37:10] are not going to be the heirs of
[37:12] raptured faith
[37:13] [Applause]
[37:15] hallelujah we are right now the heirs of
[37:19] faith we're not moving into the message
[37:21] we are in the message as a matter of
[37:23] fact but it's all we are the message
[37:27] we're not going to be around the message
[37:30] we are the message
[37:33] i think what a move of god is a move of
[37:35] god is out of the routine
[37:37] i said the moon of god is out of the
[37:38] routine a move of god is not ritualistic
[37:42] and it's not traditional a move of god
[37:44] is not theological
[37:46] can i say that right
[37:48] how do you say it theological
[37:52] i graduated because of open book tests
[37:53] thank god for them
[37:56] a move of god is not a form it's not a
[37:58] ritual it's a fire
[38:00] it's an experience
[38:02] it's an action for the man it's a
[38:04] manifestation of god it's god coming in
[38:07] his church confirming the promise of his
[38:09] word you look in the book of john the
[38:11] ninth chapter sometime and you will find
[38:13] that in the days of jesus there was a
[38:15] move of god that got started with a
[38:17] young black boy
[38:19] a young blind boy
[38:21] started a move of god the bible said in
[38:24] john 9 29 we know that god's speaking to
[38:26] moses but as for this fellow we know not
[38:29] for which he is the man answered and
[38:32] said to them why hearing is a marvelous
[38:35] thing that you know not from whence he
[38:37] is
[38:39] and yet he has opened mine eyes the
[38:42] problem of god said the blind boy is
[38:44] speaking to the spiritual leaders of the
[38:46] nation and here comes a man and opens my
[38:49] eyes by the power of god and yet you
[38:52] don't know nothing about it he said this
[38:54] is a marvelous thing he had something
[38:56] didn't he he did all right he did a man
[38:59] that could do this yet they didn't know
[39:01] which he was he said that was a
[39:04] marvelous thing one thing i love brother
[39:06] hell about about studying a prophet is
[39:09] he doesn't leave us in the past but he
[39:11] always turns the corner and brings us to
[39:13] the future and he takes his brother josh
[39:15] from john 9 to right here today and says
[39:18] now look today brethren we know we have
[39:22] a move of god
[39:23] [Applause]
[39:24] by the window we're not guessing we're
[39:26] not probing we're not presuming we know
[39:29] that we have a move of god he said we
[39:32] know it's performing miracles it's
[39:34] healing the sick it's raising the dead
[39:36] it's casting out devils it's speaking
[39:39] with tongues and interpretation it sends
[39:41] forth prophecies and they happen he
[39:43] showed the strings perfect strictly this
[39:46] isn't a strange thing that the leaders
[39:48] would say we was a bunch of crazy people
[39:50] when the leaders of the nation or the
[39:52] churches he said that's a marvelous
[39:54] thing can i just go ahead and say
[39:55] something to you if you're waiting on

[41:10] is it's a scriptural move
[41:13] you know why because jesus is very
[41:15] scriptural
[41:19] you won't find one move but what you can
[41:22] prove it by the scripture
[41:24] you say preacher can you prove that i
[41:25] can it's in the book of john the fifth
[41:27] chapter jesus said search the scriptures
[41:31] for in them you think you have eternal
[41:33] life and they are they
[41:36] which testify of me
[41:38] remember i said let me give you a
[41:39] scripture first
[41:40] with what we do it must be scriptural
[41:43] it's got to be scriptural god won't
[41:45] honor nothing else see he only honors
[41:47] his word he promised my word will not
[41:50] return to me void it will accomplish
[41:52] that
[41:53] which is purpose for he said and we see
[41:56] the word that's lauded today no matter
[42:00] how much unbelief rises in the camp
[42:03] and we got a quote to put the devil on
[42:05] the run no matter how much unbelief
[42:07] rises in the camp god will honor his
[42:10] word when he find faith to honor it by
[42:15] oh god
[42:16] god will honor his word when he finds
[42:18] faith to honor it by are you seeing
[42:20] where i'm at i'm in john the ninth
[42:22] chapter a little boy raised in the
[42:25] religious movement of the day amen and
[42:27] the religious leaders missed it they
[42:29] didn't recognize it but a little blind
[42:31] boy had faith
[42:34] he had a crevice brother david in his
[42:36] heart oh god i'm about to shout my
[42:39] shoehill's home he had a crevice in his
[42:41] heart and there was a pressure in the
[42:43] land that day that this man that was
[42:45] doing all these miracles was just a
[42:47] fanatic he was just an illegitimate
[42:49] child he was just a worked up emotional
[42:52] man but there was a pressure in the land
[42:54] that day there was a pressure that was
[42:56] moving in the land and it was looking
[42:58] for a heart that had a crevice in it
[43:00] that it could leak the faith of the
[43:02] promised word into and without one
[43:04] approval from a religious leader that
[43:06] god would come down and would vindicate
[43:09] the
[43:10] manifestation don't you see who you are
[43:13] tonight you are the living vindicated
[43:15] manifestation of the message of the hour

[43:56] was manifested now listen but the boy
[43:59] knew he had been there

[1:01:11] he'd come in their midst and they didn't
[1:01:14] even know he was there

[1:01:21] said brother ben let jesus come in
[1:01:24] oh god

[1:01:44] job you don't let one person come in
[1:01:46] this house
[1:01:49] you know you don't let one person come
[1:01:51] in here but once you stop them and you
[1:01:53] wash their feet but that foot wash
[1:01:54] flunky was blinded because there was a
[1:01:57] greater miracle coming are you hearing
[1:01:59] me that footwash flunky somehow or
[1:02:01] another didn't see jesus when he come in
[1:02:03] and he went over and sit down in the
[1:02:05] corner
[1:02:07] can i say it like this he was blinded so
[1:02:10] that your eyes could see
[1:02:12] he was blind and so your eyes could see
[1:02:14] come on church had the foot wash flunky
[1:02:16] washed his feet we wouldn't have the
[1:02:18] rest of the story but because it was
[1:02:20] more than a service it was more than a
[1:02:22] july meeting it was a predestinated
[1:02:24] moment in the presence of god he flagged
[1:02:27] in the eyes of a front washed punky
[1:02:29] because there was a type of the bride
[1:02:31] coming in the house
[1:02:37] there was a greater type coming in
[1:02:39] oh god berman said watch he come in and
[1:02:42] sit down he said i want you to catch
[1:02:44] something he said there's two parts he
[1:02:46] said there's inviting
[1:02:48] there's inviting but then there's
[1:02:50] welcoming
[1:02:52] there's inviting but then there's
[1:02:54] welcoming he said see when you back look
[1:02:57] at this definition of the word invite
[1:02:58] can i have five minutes
[1:03:00] it means to make a polite or formal or
[1:03:03] friendly request to someone to go
[1:03:05] somewhere or to do something
[1:03:07] so we have invited you
[1:03:09] by the way of announcement to these
[1:03:11] meetings

[1:03:15] invited people right y'all are here
[1:03:17] because you've been invited
[1:03:20] but you know why you come back

[1:03:25] you're made welcome
[1:03:29] you remain welcome when you're invited

[1:03:33] to be glad to entertain someone or to
[1:03:35] receive something are you ready for this
[1:03:38] it is to react with pleasure or approval
[1:03:42] brother david amen it's an action you
[1:03:45] inviting him is an action him showing up
[1:03:48] is a reaction you welcome in him it's a
[1:03:51] reaction to the action of him showing up
[1:03:54] it means to react with pleasure to an
[1:03:57] event or development it is gladly to
[1:03:59] receive can i close on this part can i
[1:04:02] close right here to welcome something is
[1:04:04] to indicate that one is relieved to be
[1:04:08] relinquished in the control or
[1:04:10] possession of something to another
[1:04:14] let me read that to you again to really
[1:04:16] welcome something is to be glad to
[1:04:18] relinquish amen control or possession of
[1:04:21] something to another can i tell you
[1:04:23] something they invite jesus but when he
[1:04:26] shows up they say don't make him shout
[1:04:28] and don't preach too long and don't let
[1:04:30] him dance the eyes and just sit in the
[1:04:32] corner amen that's just inviting him
[1:04:34] that if you want to make him welcome
[1:04:36] when he shows up and you feel his
[1:04:38] pressure in the atmosphere take your
[1:04:40] hands off your service and say god this
[1:04:43] is your song service this is your
[1:04:45] meeting this is your service these are
[1:04:47] your people this is your message i'm

[1:05:06] is invited but he only stays where he is
[1:05:08] made welcome wherever two or three are
[1:05:10] gathered together in my name there am i
[1:05:13] in the midst of them are you hearing me
[1:05:15] the prophet said the church won't
[1:05:16] welcome christ they won't welcome christ
[1:05:19] amen can i ask you something who is
[1:05:21] christ
[1:05:23] brother man who is christ i'll tell you
[1:05:25] what the bible says the bible says
[1:05:27] christ is god he is the logos of god
[1:05:31] are you hearing me and let me slap
[1:05:32] another devil while i'm here you don't
[1:05:34] want people to be moved by the preaching
[1:05:37] the word you ought to be ashamed of
[1:05:39] yourself
[1:05:41] you don't want people to respond when
[1:05:43] the word is preached you got to be
[1:05:44] ashamed of yourself you know why
[1:05:47] you know why because if i got up here
[1:05:48] and told you a sad story
[1:05:50] and i moved to my sad story to cry it'd
[1:05:52] be okay to cry and if i told you haha
[1:05:55] funny and it moves you to laugh it'd be
[1:05:57] okay to laugh amen then tell me how come
[1:06:00] i cannot stand under the creative power
[1:06:03] of the logos of almighty god and preach
[1:06:05] the inspired word listen my sermon is
[1:06:08] not coming from a man it's coming from
[1:06:10] the pitiful that i'm under tonight i
[1:06:12] have become a microphone full of
[1:06:14] purifier that whatever is fooling you
[1:06:17] it's not coming from in recovery it's
[1:06:19] not coming from the martian it's not
[1:06:21] coming from times it's coming from the
[1:06:23] pentaphile you know why because the moon
[1:06:26] is
[1:06:30] that's just saying the lord
[1:06:36] who is christ
[1:06:38] he's the word
[1:06:39] he's the logos of god i'm trying to
[1:06:41] close right here remember christ is the
[1:06:44] word he's not the theology
[1:06:46] he's the word
[1:06:48] what else is christ brother jerome
[1:06:50] christ is the anointing
[1:06:55] let me shout room up here brother matt
[1:06:58] christ
[1:06:59] is the anointing he said see the spirit
[1:07:03] that comes upon the word that quickens
[1:07:05] the word and makes it live see then he
[1:07:08] can anoint you for every blessing that's
[1:07:11] in the anointed word christ is the
[1:07:15] anointed word
[1:07:18] can i tell you oh god i'm trying to quit
[1:07:21] can i tell you austin what brother man
[1:07:23] was really saying when he said the
[1:07:24] unwelcome christ he was saying the
[1:07:27] unwelcomed anointing
[1:07:31] they want the word without the anointing
[1:07:33] they want church without anointing you
[1:07:35] know why because when the anointing
[1:07:37] comes in a meeting you no longer have
[1:07:39] control
[1:07:40] [Applause]
[1:07:49] they fought the spirit of god and we're
[1:07:51] going to control the holy ghost we're
[1:07:53] going to control who shouts we're going
[1:07:54] to control who says
[1:07:56] i'll tell you how that word should come
[1:07:58] from babylon it comes from the prince of
[1:08:00] hell and there's no room in the house of
[1:08:02] god for nicolette and leadership
[1:08:04] [Applause]
[1:08:08] i just bumped something but you all know
[1:08:09] me well enough to know how i'm right
[1:08:11] through it
[1:08:12] are you hearing me there's no room in
[1:08:14] the house of god for a man they're
[1:08:16] trying to control the holy ghost we got
[1:08:18] young people addicted to pornography we
[1:08:20] got young people leaving church and we
[1:08:22] got a bunch of plains police sitting in
[1:08:24] the house of god trying to control the
[1:08:25] anointing control the spirit of god but
[1:08:28] i say is there anybody here ready to
[1:08:30] welcome the anointing in this meeting
[1:08:32] are you ready to welcome the anointing
[1:08:34] you know what happens the bible says the
[1:08:36] cause of the anointing the yoke is
[1:08:39] destroyed the bible said the spirit of
[1:08:42] the lord is upon me he is anointed me he
[1:08:45] has equipped me as the messiah in an
[1:08:47] administrative office to manifest
[1:08:49] messiah's power
[1:08:51] [Applause]
[1:08:53] brother joe
[1:08:54] they don't want the anointing
[1:08:57] they don't want the anointing but we
[1:08:59] need it
[1:09:01] we've had enough unannoying singing
[1:09:03] [Music]
[1:09:04] come on i'm going to preach we've had
[1:09:06] enough unanointed preaching we've had
[1:09:08] enough men's ideas behind the pulpit
[1:09:11] restricting the sons and daughters of
[1:09:13] god i stay away with that nonsense and
[1:09:16] up with the anointing
[1:09:17] [Applause]
[1:09:20] [Music]
[1:09:26] a little bit and we wrote that thing off
[1:09:28] and they come right back you know why
[1:09:29] because the anointing don't break the
[1:09:31] anointing destroys
[1:09:34] testing one two it's still working i
[1:09:36] said the anointing don't break the
[1:09:38] anointing destroys i didn't come here
[1:09:41] just for a breakthrough i come here for
[1:09:43] a destroy through
[1:09:45] i come here for a destroyer i want to
[1:09:47] announce to that devil right now his
[1:09:49] scheme is destroyed his idea is
[1:09:51] destroyed and jesus christ the son of
[1:09:54] god
[1:09:55] now you know i'm telling you the truth
[1:09:57] you say preacher why don't you want that
[1:09:58] yolk broke because if that yolk is broke
[1:10:01] tonight you know what happens when
[1:10:02] something's broke
[1:10:04] there's a potential to repair it so you
[1:10:07] break it you take it to the store and
[1:10:09] they repair it but if they look at it
[1:10:11] and they say it is destroyed
[1:10:16] it's beyond repairing
[1:10:18] it's beyond putting back together it's
[1:10:20] beyond counseling not together when the
[1:10:23] spirit of the lord comes in the building
[1:10:25] and the anointing breaks out upon the
[1:10:26] congregation it don't just break for you
[1:10:29] it destroys the oak but i speak to you
[1:10:32] in the name of the lord by the word of
[1:10:34] faith there's some yokes right now being
[1:10:36] destroyed in the house of god because
[1:10:39] the anointing has been welcomed is there
