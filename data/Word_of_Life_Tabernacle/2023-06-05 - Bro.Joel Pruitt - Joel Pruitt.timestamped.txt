[36:17] amen
[36:19] you happy to be in the house of the Lord
[36:21] this afternoon
[36:22] and some of you are you happy to be here
[36:25] this in the house of the Lord amen I
[36:28] tell you what it's always an honor to be
[36:29] able to stand here before you I've got a
[36:31] real bad rebound up here brother Gabe
[36:34] I sound bad anyway so I need this to
[36:36] sound just as good as possible amen if
[36:39] you have your Bibles let's turn to John
[36:41] chapter 11.
[36:44] and we're going to read from verse 25
[36:45] 26.
[36:47] man do you love the Lord this afternoon
[36:49] amen
[36:51] John chapter 11 25 26
[36:55] say man when you've got it
[36:58] and Jesus said unto her I am the
[37:01] resurrection and the life now this is
[37:03] Jesus going to the grave of Lazarus
[37:05] and he said I am the resurrection and
[37:08] the life he that believeth in me though
[37:11] he were dead yet shall he live
[37:14] verse 26 and whosoever liveth and
[37:17] believeth in me shall never die
[37:19] and he asked this question believe us
[37:21] thou this
[37:23] and in John 5 and verse 12
[37:27] he that hath the son half-life
[37:30] and he that hath not the son of God
[37:33] hath not life you may be seated may the
[37:36] Lord add His blessings to the reading of
[37:38] the word
[37:41] [Music]
[37:42] I was reading that there and you know
[37:44] the Story of Lazarus is a very uh
[37:46] interesting story but I I believe
[37:48] there's a a message there within the
[37:51] message if if you will of The Story of
[37:53] Lazarus when Lazarus is is laying there
[37:56] it was a friend of Jesus and he's laying
[37:58] there in the Tomb and he had died and
[38:01] you know Jesus makes a statement I'm
[38:02] glad that I wasn't here to pray for him
[38:05] I'm glad for your sakes that he passed
[38:07] because Jesus knew who he was Jesus knew
[38:10] that the resurrection and the life was
[38:12] within him and I think today if if we
[38:15] could just take that story just for a
[38:17] second and look at it and realize that
[38:19] he was trying to show them who he was
[38:22] because he knew by the word who he was
[38:25] but now the word is going to speak and
[38:28] the life will come into a man who has
[38:29] been dead for four days and I think if
[38:32] we can look at that for just a moment
[38:33] and realize that when we speak if the
[38:36] word is within us and the word speaks
[38:38] through us then you who were once dead
[38:40] in your trespasses and sins can be made
[38:43] alive again can you say amen I think
[38:45] that is what the word has come to do is
[38:48] to Quicken our mortal bodies and I would
[38:50] like to take a subject today quick into
[38:52] Life by the word and I believe that's
[38:55] what happened at the grave of Lazarus
[38:56] that day I believe that it was quickened
[38:58] by the word speaking to him can you say
[39:01] Amen it wasn't an emotion I doubt Jesus
[39:03] went down there and had to dance and and
[39:05] to shout around the grave although that
[39:07] would be fine but what he did was he
[39:08] went down and he spoke the word to
[39:10] Lazarus and Lazarus came forth and I
[39:13] believe today if we can just speak the
[39:15] word the word has such a power in it and
[39:18] such an authority in it that those who
[39:21] are dead around us if we speak the word
[39:23] to him we can call them forth to life
[39:25] you can speak the word over your
[39:26] children you can speak the word over
[39:28] your family and just like Lazarus that
[39:30] was laying there dead you speak the word
[39:32] and watch them come back to life watch
[39:34] them come back home what is it it is you
[39:36] speaking the word of God it is Christ
[39:38] being revealed in you today can you say
[39:41] amen I believe that God today wants a
[39:43] people who are not afraid to speak the
[39:45] word of God and not afraid to take a
[39:47] hold of the promises of God today we're
[39:50] not afraid we're not ashamed of it but
[39:52] we can take the word and use it just
[39:54] like Jesus did why because we're not
[39:56] Jesus Christ but in US dwells The Same
[39:58] Spirit and the same spirit that Jesus
[40:01] had he said if that Spirit dwells in you
[40:03] it will Quicken your mortal bodies can
[40:05] you say Amen today
[40:07] now we can see that God was reflected
[40:10] first through Christ and then you can
[40:13] look down Through the Ages and brother
[40:14] Branham talks about well he was
[40:16] reflected through the prophets and then
[40:17] he was reflected in in Christ in such a
[40:19] manner that we could see the very
[40:21] attributes the very uh how would we say
[40:24] this the very uh character of God being
[40:26] expressed through Christ and and so
[40:28] brother Branham goes on and he talks
[40:29] about these these Reflections and how
[40:31] God was reflected down through the
[40:33] prophets and he says he says now let us
[40:35] look at some that has been quickened
[40:36] into this house of God of their age he
[40:39] said Enoch was the Living Word of God of
[40:42] his age he was a prophet he said a
[40:44] prophet is God's reflector how many
[40:46] knows that the reflector doesn't reflect
[40:48] itself it re the reflector is the
[40:51] reflection there has to be something to
[40:53] strike the reflector to make it reflect
[40:56] can I get some more monitor up here
[40:57] brother game there has to be something
[40:59] to strike the reflector to make it
[41:01] reflect so a prophet is a chosen vessel
[41:04] of God that cannot reflect nothing at
[41:07] all but he's in direct line with that
[41:09] reflection of God to reflect the image
[41:12] of Christ the word so remember it's not
[41:15] the prophet that is the reflection but
[41:17] he is only reflecting the word that is
[41:19] coming that day we are only reflecting
[41:22] Christ to the people of the day we are
[41:24] not Christ himself we are not the
[41:26] literal body ourselves but yet we make
[41:28] up a mini-membered body which is the
[41:30] reflection of Christ on the Earth today
[41:32] and he said so you think about you walk
[41:34] out in the parking lot and the sun is
[41:36] shining down on a white car and you look
[41:37] at that car and you see that sun it just
[41:39] about blinds you off of that car but the
[41:41] car is not the Sun but the sun is
[41:43] shining onto the car and the reflection
[41:45] is coming back to you what is it it is
[41:47] Christ himself reflecting to the
[41:49] believer and the believer reflecting the
[41:52] word of God to you I hope you can see it
[41:54] today when I saw this I realized
[41:56] something we're missing it we're trying
[41:57] to say well that man was God that man
[41:59] was Christ no they are reflecting the
[42:01] very word for their hour brother Branham
[42:04] was in Christ but he was reflecting
[42:06] Christ to us
[42:07] we are not Christ ourselves but we are
[42:10] reflecting Christ today there is listen
[42:12] we can look at it like this we can say
[42:14] well well you don't look like Christ no
[42:16] but if the spirit is in you and if his
[42:19] Spirit has shown upon you then the very
[42:21] Life Will Shine from you it'll be the
[42:23] same thing just the same reflection as
[42:25] looking at a car in the Sun and what is
[42:27] it it is a reflection of Christ he said
[42:30] see nothing else can do it
[42:32] you are a reflector that's the reason
[42:35] the prophet had to eat the book brother
[42:37] Ben and I were talking about this quote
[42:38] just in the back room he said that's the
[42:40] reason he had to eat the scroll he had
[42:42] to reflect that word for that age he
[42:44] said you got it he said notice Enoch
[42:46] God's perfect reflector and type when
[42:49] God was through with him he just
[42:51] translated him and took him up the
[42:52] mechanics that had that he had reflected
[42:55] and became Dynamics with the spirit and
[42:58] took him up he said the same in the Days
[43:00] of Elijah Elijah even to his bones were
[43:03] that reflection of God in his body being
[43:05] made manifest the word of God he said
[43:08] there laid a dead man on it and he
[43:09] sparked to life again what was it God
[43:11] had reflected into that body so long and
[43:14] so much that the reflection of God was
[43:16] still coming out of his bones I wonder
[43:18] sometimes if you find yourself sitting
[43:20] there in a dead and cold condition if
[43:22] you could just realize who you are and
[43:24] realize that God has shined his light in
[43:27] this day you can be the reflection of
[43:29] the word today you don't have to wait
[43:31] for a prophet to come back you don't
[43:33] have to wait for your favorite
[43:34] evangelist to come by but you are the
[43:36] reflection of Christ today can you say
[43:39] Amen we don't have to wait on nothing
[43:40] but the spirit of Christ is here
[43:44] we are the sons of God we have the
[43:46] spirit of Christ in us there's nothing
[43:48] more to take place but God has already
[43:50] sent his Spirit into the church if we
[43:52] can take a hold of it we can be the
[43:54] reflectors today just like Enoch and
[43:56] guess what at the end of our life just
[43:58] like Enoch we get to be translated too
[44:01] we get to walk out of here without even
[44:03] tasting death we don't even have to face
[44:06] death as a Believer a Believer can't die
[44:08] but you will be translated you will be
[44:11] taken out he said notice now he said
[44:13] then you are a son of God in the house
[44:15] of God you are a part of God's economy
[44:18] and he ties this into Romans 8 1. he
[44:21] said then there is no condemnation to
[44:22] them which are in Christ Jesus and
[44:24] brother Ben read that this morning for
[44:26] you walk not after the flesh but you're
[44:28] walking after the spirit that is on the
[44:30] inside of you you're not reflecting just
[44:32] the nature of a flesh man anymore but
[44:34] you are reflecting the very nature of
[44:37] Christ in you
[44:39] then he said they are dead to the world
[44:42] and alive in him and living in this
[44:45] present day making the word that God has
[44:48] used them or foreordained to them
[44:50] placing their name in this bright book
[44:53] aren't you thankful for that and when
[44:54] the waters comes upon that seed that's
[44:56] in the heart it raises it up to the
[44:59] bride of Christ he said oh my just
[45:01] perfect as it can be in every age it's
[45:04] been that way the Lutheran's under
[45:06] justification the feet that raised it
[45:09] like that Wesley under sanctification
[45:10] the Pentecostals under the arms the
[45:12] works and the deeds and so forth he said
[45:14] they had to be legalists but now we have
[45:16] come to the Head the Capstone what is it
[45:18] the fullness of the body of Christ is
[45:21] coming under one head and it is Grace
[45:23] Grace to you today Church you're no
[45:25] longer under the law you're no longer in
[45:28] sin and trespasses and bound down to the
[45:30] law but you have been set free by the
[45:33] spirit of God in your day can you say
[45:35] amen he said The Headstone crying Grace
[45:37] he said pass from death and Creed into a
[45:40] Living Word can somebody say Living Word
[45:42] into a living word today of the Living
[45:46] God he said that's God's only provided
[45:49] plan for his age
[45:51] I'll tell you what I like that that's
[45:54] the only provided plan that God has
[45:56] today is to have a Living Word and I'll
[45:58] say this in a living body called The
[46:01] Bride of Jesus Christ
[46:03] he said his sons in the word age excuse
[46:06] me God's only provided plan for his age
[46:08] his sons in the word age quickened by
[46:11] the spirit like a spark that's lit off
[46:14] of something to make it alive and seated
[46:17] now in Heavenly places and he says in
[46:20] present tense already alive and subject
[46:24] to every promise in the word of God and
[46:28] subject to every promise you are subject
[46:31] to every promise in the word of God he
[46:34] said then what does that do you being a
[46:36] part of God's Gene a part of the word
[46:39] other men a part of God's word seated
[46:41] together manifest the entire body of
[46:43] Christ because there's no leaven among
[46:46] you aren't you thankful for that he said
[46:47] you and other men remember it's not just
[46:50] what you see here that makes up the body
[46:52] but it is a a body of Christ that may be
[46:55] around the world is a universal body but
[46:58] we are making up the body of Christ on
[47:00] the Earth today and I hope you can see
[47:02] it Church you are more than just a flesh
[47:05] being you have now the spirit of Christ
[47:08] in you that is quickening you from the
[47:10] things that kept you down that kept you
[47:13] back in the denominational system things
[47:15] that held you down in the Baptist and
[47:17] the methodists and the Catholic and the
[47:18] Pentecostal but now you have been
[47:20] quickened not by an emotion not by a
[47:23] sensation but you have been quickened by
[47:25] the revealing of the word of God today
[47:27] because the prophet has come and
[47:30] revealed Christ to you and because
[47:32] you've seen that reflection you've seen
[47:34] the light on the prophet and now the
[47:36] very light is in you and you have become
[47:39] reflectors of Christ's word today
[47:42] oh I believe Christ is right here among
[47:44] us if we could just recognize it's not
[47:46] in just one man it's not in just a one
[47:48] group of people but it is a
[47:50] many-membered body of Christ today we
[47:52] are his heirs we are his attributes on
[47:55] the Earth today he said his sons were
[47:58] quickened he said then what does it do
[47:59] you being a part of God's Gene a part of
[48:01] the word other men a part of God's word
[48:03] seated together today manifest the
[48:06] entire body of Christ because there's no
[48:08] leaven among you you are the reflection
[48:12] of Christ on the Earth today can you say
[48:14] Amen you are living the word for this
[48:17] age you are making the word live
[48:20] by living by letting it live through you
[48:23] if the word has no body
[48:26] then where would it go if Jesus had no
[48:29] body he would have never been able to go
[48:30] to the grave of Lazarus and call him
[48:32] from the dead
[48:34] the voice of God must have a body to
[48:36] live in because God speaks through the
[48:39] body think about it it's not just on
[48:42] tape listen to me church it's not just
[48:44] on tape you can sit there and hear it
[48:46] and hear it and it'll never reflect
[48:48] anything but the fact that you've
[48:50] listened to tapes and that's good but
[48:52] listen the very bride of Christ will be
[48:55] saying the same thing that the prophet
[48:57] said why because he came with the voice
[49:00] of God in him Jesus did and the voice of
[49:03] God called Lazarus from the dead and
[49:05] that same power is in the bride today
[49:07] that same quickening power is not just
[49:10] in Jesus not just in Paul not just in
[49:13] brother Branham but it is in the many
[49:15] membered body called The Bride today
[49:17] you have the quickening power in you
[49:21] what called us the word called us it
[49:25] called us from the deadness that we were
[49:26] in whether it was denominations whether
[49:28] it was dead to sins whatever it was the
[49:30] word has called us and made us alive
[49:33] through the word the body of Christ the
[49:36] word is being manifested through the
[49:38] called out uh prophet of the day think
[49:42] about it the prophet came to call out a
[49:44] body that's his whole Ministry was to
[49:46] come and call out a bride out of a
[49:48] denominational system out of a church
[49:50] order out of something that looked like
[49:52] it was so well put together but in it
[49:54] you would find Creeds and dogmas and you
[49:56] would find that they would bring back
[49:58] and they would major on a gift or they
[49:59] would major on an emotion or they would
[50:01] major on a priest or a pope or something
[50:03] like that but in this day the prophet of
[50:06] God pointed us back and set your major
[50:08] on the word of God because that's the
[50:10] only thing that's going to make a living
[50:12] body of Christ today because you are
[50:15] living out the word today brother
[50:18] Branham talks about it when he talks
[50:20] about the no leaven among you he said
[50:22] just the word only I need a little more
[50:25] monitor brother Gabe I'm sorry I just
[50:27] can't hear myself and that's that's
[50:28] usually good
[50:30] no leaven among you just the word only
[50:31] brother Braham says sedan in Heavenly
[50:33] places in the door where he puts his
[50:36] name Christ Jesus no leaven among you
[50:39] that brings the entire fullness of the
[50:41] godhead bodily among you thank you it
[50:44] couldn't do it in Luther's age couldn't
[50:47] do it in Wesley's age couldn't do it in
[50:50] the Pentecostal age but in the day when
[50:53] the son of man will be manifested
[50:54] revealed and brought back to the church
[50:57] together with the entire deity of God
[50:59] among his people showing the same
[51:02] visible signs manifesting himself like
[51:04] he did at the beginning when he was
[51:06] manifested on Earth in the form of a
[51:08] prophet God he said Oh Glory promised by
[51:11] Malachi 4 promised by the rest of the
[51:13] scriptures where you worship at the
[51:15] house of God seated in present tense he
[51:19] says now we know the prophet could
[51:20] reflect Christ because he did it All
[51:22] Through the Ages and we know that that
[51:25] we could see Christ in his attributes
[51:27] and we could see Christ because he could
[51:29] call a person from the dead or he could
[51:30] go down to Sister Hattie Wright and he
[51:32] said he said you know you can speak what
[51:34] you will and it was him giving Authority
[51:36] what through a god-given message and a
[51:38] gift that God had given him but remember
[51:40] then it had to change to the prophecy
[51:43] because the prophet could stand there
[51:44] there and you would look at the prophet
[51:46] and you say well my eyes are looking to
[51:48] you and your ordained elitist but then
[51:51] the prophet had to turn around and say
[51:52] don't look to a man but look to the
[51:54] prophecy look to the word that has come
[51:57] look to this day and this hour it's no
[52:00] longer looking to a mortal man on this
[52:02] Earth but it's looking to have
[52:04] Vindicated for ordained Body of Christ
[52:06] on the earth that is living out the
[52:08] revelation of Jesus Christ
[52:11] we are more than just another church we
[52:14] are more than just another organization
[52:16] we better be we are more than just
[52:18] another denomination that is called to
[52:20] say we've got to sit around and do a
[52:22] certain thing at a certain time no we
[52:25] are called to be living men of God and
[52:28] women of God to live out the Life of
[52:30] Christ in our age
[52:33] The Works that were in Christ the flesh
[52:36] body
[52:37] that God created and lived in will still
[52:40] be living out in this body
[52:44] think about it that body that God
[52:45] created
[52:47] did all sorts of Works while he was on
[52:49] Earth
[52:50] he could go into the City and he could
[52:52] cast out demons and and it was the
[52:54] spirit of God that was on the flesh
[52:55] brother Branham said that flesh had to
[52:57] be a man and it had to die as a man but
[53:00] when God the spirit would Quicken that
[53:02] body then that was no more a man but it
[53:04] was God reflecting himself through human
[53:06] flesh and when you see it in that way
[53:09] you realize that the flesh had to die
[53:11] because he had to be tempted in all like
[53:13] manner he had to go into the grave he
[53:15] had to die a sinner brother Branham said
[53:17] so that he could be raised up as a God
[53:20] man and he could be set at the right
[53:23] hand of God and be there to atone for
[53:26] our sins brother Brandon would go on to
[53:28] talk about the living body of Christ and
[53:30] he would say when he went down to the
[53:32] Grave there of Lazarus he was nothing
[53:34] but a man he said he wept like a man he
[53:36] he talked like a man he missed his
[53:38] friend like a man you know what it was a
[53:41] man flesh body but when he pulled his
[53:43] shoulders back it was the quickening
[53:45] power through the man calling a dead man
[53:48] to life again and I would like to say to
[53:50] you today you have the same power today
[53:53] because that power that is within you
[53:56] you can walk up to your children that
[53:58] have backslid you can walk up and you
[54:00] can say child you may be gone you can
[54:03] tell them sister Karen you can say you
[54:04] may have went as far as you think you
[54:06] can go you may look like you're
[54:08] completely lost but I serve a living God
[54:11] who can bring those children back from
[54:13] the dead they can bring them back from
[54:15] the from their sin and trespasses they
[54:17] live in what is it we don't have to lose
[54:19] a one of them because the body of Christ
[54:22] is here and we can call the dead things
[54:25] back to life
[54:27] you say you're making us God the spirit
[54:29] that is within us is the power the
[54:32] spirit that is in US is the quickening
[54:34] power it's not this flesh I have no
[54:36] power you have no power but within you
[54:39] is a quickening power and it gives you
[54:41] the authority to speak that's what we
[54:44] have today we have the authority within
[54:46] us
[54:47] Saint John 14 12 through 14 verily
[54:50] verily I say unto you he that believeth
[54:52] on me the works that I do shall he do
[54:54] also and Greater Works than these shall
[54:57] he do because I go unto my father and
[54:59] whatsoever you shall ask in my name that
[55:02] will I do that the father may be
[55:05] glorified in the son so you can see it
[55:07] there the father had to be glorified in
[55:10] the son because the works that he
[55:11] because he would speak in his name and
[55:13] if you go on down he says the same or
[55:15] the Greater Works will you do
[55:17] so what are those Greater Works they're
[55:19] here
[55:20] brother Branham would turn around and
[55:22] say the same Works was creating a you
[55:25] could take a loaf of bread and create
[55:26] more bread you could take a fish and
[55:28] create more fish because there was
[55:29] something there that Crea that could
[55:31] create but he would turn around and say
[55:33] the Greater Works was that third pull he
[55:36] could create squirrels where there was
[55:37] no squirrels he could create eyes where
[55:40] there was no eyes he could create where
[55:42] there was nothing there to create from
[55:44] what was it it was a spoken word of God
[55:46] it was a Greater Works living out in our
[55:50] day and they've been proved to us
[55:52] they've been proven to us Eddie Wright
[55:54] could speak brother Branham didn't have
[55:56] to speak for her but he could say you
[55:57] speak you asked and she could speak and
[56:00] the word of God would go forth from her
[56:02] mouth because the greater work she could
[56:05] do because why she had accepted the
[56:08] third pull message of a prophet
[56:10] messenger
[56:11] she had said that's nothing but the
[56:13] truth and when you can say to the
[56:15] message of the hour that's nothing but
[56:17] the truth then you take on that third
[56:19] pull Greater Works in you why because
[56:22] the Greater Works the word is now in you
[56:24] you say I don't brother brother Branham
[56:26] didn't have the Greater Works yes he did
[56:28] but listen to me it wasn't just for him
[56:30] it was him speaking the word that God
[56:33] gave to him and then the bride said yes
[56:36] that's nothing but the truth and then
[56:39] when you spoke that then the Greater
[56:41] Works could come from you not just the
[56:43] prophet
[56:45] if you had need of something to eat you
[56:47] could speak and it would be there if you
[56:50] had need of healing you could speak an
[56:52] arm on that wasn't there if you had need
[56:55] of it you could speak anything into
[56:57] existence brother Brandon said you could
[56:59] speak in a new world and go live on it
[57:01] what is it it is the the power of the
[57:04] Holy Ghost in the bride today it is the
[57:07] Greater Works promise from John 14 12.
[57:10] Church don't let somebody tell you that
[57:12] a prophet has to come back for the
[57:13] Greater Works don't let somebody tell
[57:15] you that the Greater Works have to be
[57:17] because you have to listen to the tapes
[57:19] to get the quickening power no the
[57:21] quickening power is in you
[57:23] and if the quickening powers in you it
[57:25] has a voice and he can speak it doesn't
[57:28] have to be a hush it don't have to be
[57:30] the preachers don't have to be told to
[57:32] shut up no the preachers are going to
[57:34] preach why because the quickening power
[57:36] is in the preacher but it is not just
[57:39] the preacher it is in you it is in every
[57:42] one of you what is it on the day of
[57:43] Pentecost it didn't just go into the
[57:45] disciples but it went into every one of
[57:47] them that came into the room to be
[57:49] filled with the Holy Ghost
[57:51] every one of them could receive the same
[57:54] power every one of them
[57:57] and so is it today men will limit it to
[58:01] a man men will say you can't receive it
[58:04] but a prophet could do it he's got to
[58:07] come back so that he can speak arms and
[58:09] legs on you he got to come back so that
[58:12] you can have the power of a Rapture
[58:14] that's nonsense the power for the
[58:17] Rapture is in you today
[58:20] when you hear false Doctrine like that
[58:23] what it is is they don't know who they
[58:25] are they've never come in contact with
[58:27] the word for their day they've never
[58:29] come in contact with a holy ghost
[58:31] that'll Quicken you from the things that
[58:34] you once did the Devils that once would
[58:36] bind you but remember then the midst of
[58:38] the battle that's when you have to stand
[58:40] up and say I don't care what you said I
[58:42] don't care what you believe I believe
[58:44] the word that was for my age and by the
[58:47] word I have the quickening power
[58:50] it was the word of God that's quickened
[58:52] us
[58:53] he said well I don't feel like
[58:54] worshiping today let the word get in
[58:57] your heart and you can't help but
[58:59] worship
[59:00] when they come down to the Red Sea all
[59:04] they had to do was listen to Moses
[59:06] and when they listened to him they were
[59:08] all going to go back well Pharaoh's Army
[59:10] was coming and they were all going to go
[59:12] back because they thought there was no
[59:13] way ahead but then the word of God spoke
[59:16] and created a path for them to go
[59:18] through on and they followed the word
[59:20] and then when they got to the other side
[59:22] I hope you hear me now when they got to
[59:24] the other side they could beat their
[59:26] tambourines and they could shout and
[59:28] they could dance why because they had
[59:31] followed the Vindicated Prophet for
[59:33] their day we're not following man's
[59:35] ideas we're not following a seminary or
[59:38] a theological idea of some brainwashed
[59:40] denominational chicken preachers but
[59:42] we're following the word of God for our
[59:44] day I hope you hear me today we don't
[59:47] have to be discouraged and beat down and
[59:50] kicked to the side for nobody
[59:52] because we are the living body today of
[59:55] Christ on the Earth
[59:57] somebody come tell you something
[59:58] different say get thee behind me Satan
[1:00:00] get out of my life you don't belong here
[1:00:04] because this message is a promise this
[1:00:07] message is not a message of negativity
[1:00:10] well if you don't turn that tape on at
[1:00:12] two o'clock on the dot then you may not
[1:00:14] be bride oh come on free well I'll tell
[1:00:17] you what I've come out of that nonsense
[1:00:18] I've left Egypt but I'm going to a
[1:00:21] promised land where all the promises lay
[1:00:23] the promises of God that said your
[1:00:26] children can come with you your
[1:00:27] household can come with you all you have
[1:00:29] to do is follow the message nobody else
[1:00:32] I don't have to follow some new Prophet
[1:00:35] or some new preacher but I can follow
[1:00:37] the message of the hour
[1:00:39] because you want to talk about
[1:00:41] perfection you want to talk about
[1:00:43] perfection you can find the mistakes all
[1:00:44] you want to you can point to a man's
[1:00:47] human errors if you want to but I'm here
[1:00:49] to tell you that God gave us the best he
[1:00:51] could give us when he gave us the
[1:00:53] message of the hour
[1:00:54] if he'd have had somebody better he'd
[1:00:56] have sent him if it had somebody I'm
[1:00:59] gonna just preach to you for a minute if
[1:01:01] he'd had somebody better in mind then
[1:01:03] you're telling me God's not good enough
[1:01:05] to send that one no God was big enough
[1:01:08] to give you the best thing he could give
[1:01:10] you he was big enough to send a prophet
[1:01:13] who may have not had nothing but a
[1:01:15] seventh grade education but the man had
[1:01:17] the quickening power to bring out a
[1:01:19] bride the man had something on the
[1:01:21] inside he wasn't so big that he had to
[1:01:24] go follow after denomination and take
[1:01:26] the biggest check and the biggest
[1:01:27] paycheck no but he followed the will of
[1:01:29] God and he showed you the way that you
[1:01:33] could live all you have to do is walk
[1:01:35] humbly he said live a Christian Life and
[1:01:37] just walk in the word of God Walk In The
[1:01:39] Light for your age and I'll tell you
[1:01:41] watch the miracles happen watch the
[1:01:44] signs of the believer come in your life
[1:01:46] it ain't no workup it ain't no shouting
[1:01:49] because you feel like the music's just
[1:01:51] right it ain't none of that nonsense
[1:01:52] I'll tell you what I shouldn't say
[1:01:54] nonsense that's okay but if the word
[1:01:58] I'll tell you what a prophet said he
[1:02:00] said if the word hasn't quickened you it
[1:02:03] could be because it was a dead seed now
[1:02:05] I don't want to believe that about any
[1:02:07] of you or myself so I'd like to tell you
[1:02:09] today if the word Goes Forth let the
[1:02:12] quickening power make it live through
[1:02:14] you
[1:02:15] if the word has struck the seed in your
[1:02:17] heart then I I challenge you to stand up
[1:02:21] and believe it in the name of Jesus I
[1:02:23] challenge you not to sit there and say
[1:02:25] well it was another good service it was
[1:02:28] just another good day at church and we
[1:02:30] had some good music and some good
[1:02:31] singing we had we had a we had a pretty
[1:02:34] bad preacher but everything else was
[1:02:35] pretty good but I'm going to tell you
[1:02:37] today if the word I don't care who
[1:02:39] speaks it I don't care if a donkey
[1:02:41] speaks it brother Ben if the word has
[1:02:43] struck your heart today
[1:02:45] if faith has struck the seed if there's
[1:02:48] life in you
[1:02:49] then watch that word live through your
[1:02:51] life oh I'll tell you Church it ought to
[1:02:54] make somebody excited enough to shout
[1:02:55] today it ought to make somebody get out
[1:02:58] of the deadness that they're sitting in
[1:02:59] brother Bradham said sometimes you're
[1:03:01] sitting there and you're dead it's 12
[1:03:02] o'clock well I'll tell you if there's a
[1:03:04] seat on the inside then there's nothing
[1:03:06] Dead about this church if there's a seed
[1:03:09] on the inside nothing can stop the dance
[1:03:12] when they got to the other side nothing
[1:03:15] could stop marry him from shouting
[1:03:17] nothing could stop her from playing that
[1:03:19] tambourine nothing could stop her praise
[1:03:21] why because they had just defeated the
[1:03:24] biggest army that was chasing them
[1:03:26] Devils were after him they were riding
[1:03:28] chariots and you know what maybe these
[1:03:30] children of Israel would just walk in
[1:03:31] maybe they didn't have much according to
[1:03:33] the world maybe they didn't have the
[1:03:35] biggest denomination but I'll tell you
[1:03:36] what they had they had a prophet that
[1:03:39] was showing them the word for the age
[1:03:40] and they were following the prophet and
[1:03:43] you know what come before they followed
[1:03:44] the prophet they had to go in their
[1:03:46] homes and they sit there and they had to
[1:03:48] apply the token
[1:03:51] it wasn't just them following him out of
[1:03:53] the goodness of their hearts
[1:03:55] but the token had kept them from death
[1:03:57] oh I hope you hear me today
[1:04:00] some of you were sitting in a chicken
[1:04:03] pen
[1:04:04] oh yeah and a message came and said you
[1:04:07] must have the token you must have the
[1:04:10] Life of Christ in you and you didn't
[1:04:13] turn it down but you accepted it why
[1:04:16] because there was a predestinated seed
[1:04:18] on the inside and when the message come
[1:04:21] by and the light struck the seed it grew
[1:04:24] into a son or daughter of God what did
[1:04:27] it do it showed that Christ's word
[1:04:29] wouldn't go out void but it would return
[1:04:32] to him again listen Church you are not
[1:04:34] defeated you are not cast down you
[1:04:37] weren't caught at the Red Sea but you
[1:04:39] followed a prophet on through the waters
[1:04:41] and remember today Church you're not
[1:04:43] following a dead word you're not
[1:04:45] following a letter only but you're
[1:04:47] following a Vindicated for ordained
[1:04:50] message to a bride today and I don't
[1:04:52] want to hear oh it's a dead word I don't
[1:04:55] want to hear that this is the most alive
[1:04:56] thing on the message Earth today listen
[1:04:59] the Pentecostals that are shouting over
[1:05:00] the music and the speaking in tongues
[1:05:03] and all these things that's called dead
[1:05:05] because they're going back to something
[1:05:06] that was something that was dried up
[1:05:09] something from another age but to this
[1:05:11] age there is Prophet Messenger to this
[1:05:14] age there is a word that came forth to
[1:05:16] this age we have been called to more
[1:05:20] than just a good time but we can shout
[1:05:22] over the word we can shout because our
[1:05:25] names have been written in the Lamb's
[1:05:27] Book of Life
[1:05:28] Paul we are the bride of Christ that
[1:05:30] ought to make us happier than anything
[1:05:31] yes sir we don't have to
[1:05:35] yeah we don't have to be beat down say
[1:05:37] well the Pentecostals they shout at all
[1:05:39] service
[1:05:40] why can't we do that
[1:05:42] well I mean if we do that's wonderful
[1:05:45] but we don't have to to know that what
[1:05:47] we've got is the goods we can pick up
[1:05:50] the Bible right here and point you to
[1:05:53] everything we believe and it's true
[1:05:56] they can point you to Acts 2 38 but then
[1:06:01] when you get down on the tongues being
[1:06:03] the evidence they deny it this bride
[1:06:05] doesn't deny one word
[1:06:08] this bride will follow the prophet
[1:06:10] Messenger to the age and listen we don't
[1:06:12] follow him just because he's a man that
[1:06:14] that did gifts and signs and wonders we
[1:06:16] follow him because he showed us the word
[1:06:18] of God we follow him because he took us
[1:06:20] back to this and he did the same works
[1:06:23] but that didn't stop with him it wasn't
[1:06:25] limited to just him but it was for you
[1:06:28] also he said Jesus Christ the same
[1:06:31] yesterday he showed you what he did then
[1:06:33] he showed you what he's going to do
[1:06:35] today he said and today and then he said
[1:06:37] forever that was not just for the
[1:06:40] prophet that was not just for Christ but
[1:06:43] that was for you because Christ had to
[1:06:46] live through somebody
[1:06:48] can you say Amen
[1:06:50] Christ couldn't just think about it if
[1:06:52] there was no body of Christ then where
[1:06:53] is he
[1:06:55] was a spirit with nobody to go into
[1:06:58] but because we are here
[1:07:00] we have given him a place to dwell
[1:07:03] this is his house this is his body and
[1:07:08] if we ever look at ourselves like we are
[1:07:10] the temple we are the body of Christ and
[1:07:13] think about it because we can give we
[1:07:15] give him first place in our lives that
[1:07:17] way because we realize this is not my
[1:07:19] own
[1:07:20] I'm giving everything I've got to Jesus
[1:07:23] maybe you say well I'm not real gifted
[1:07:24] we'll give what you got to Jesus give
[1:07:27] what you've got to him let him come in
[1:07:29] and brother Brandon would talk about
[1:07:30] indoors to adore him he would say let
[1:07:33] him come into every room of your house
[1:07:34] don't just invite him into the one room
[1:07:36] but let him come in and fill every being
[1:07:39] let him come in and not just fill you
[1:07:41] with a head knowledge but let him come
[1:07:43] in and give you the baptism of the Holy
[1:07:45] Ghost so that you don't just have to
[1:07:47] speak in tongues no but what it does it
[1:07:49] is a resurrection power that Christ had
[1:07:52] at the grave of Lazarus that is still
[1:07:54] yours today
[1:07:56] brother Brandon would go home down here
[1:07:58] he said now the holy spirit is here on
[1:08:00] Earth
[1:08:01] looking out those individuals that God
[1:08:03] has ordained to life in this age
[1:08:07] and as soon as it finds it it does just
[1:08:11] like it did on Jesus Christ
[1:08:13] you see what I'm saying now
[1:08:16] you say well you're saying the word
[1:08:17] Jesus Christ no but the works and the
[1:08:19] same spirit is here Among Us I'm not
[1:08:22] here trying to make you God or me God or
[1:08:24] you bought you the literal Jesus Christ
[1:08:26] I'm not trying to do any of that what
[1:08:28] I'm trying to tell you is if the spirit
[1:08:29] that raised Christ from the dead dwells
[1:08:31] in you then it will Quicken your mortal
[1:08:33] body
[1:08:36] the great super Son of God who redeemed
[1:08:38] us all he said it comes down and takes
[1:08:41] its place of Abode into the human life
[1:08:43] he said now notice it brought the
[1:08:46] quickening power
[1:08:47] now that quickening power that come upon
[1:08:50] Jesus quickened him to manifest every
[1:08:53] promise of the word of that day
[1:08:57] now listen this is the application part
[1:08:58] he said so does the holy spirit that
[1:09:01] come upon us in this day if it's not a
[1:09:04] mockery Holy Spirit if it's not the
[1:09:06] devil mocking the Holy Spirit but is the
[1:09:09] real true Holy Spirit it'll manifest the
[1:09:12] promise of this hour when it fell upon
[1:09:15] Luther it manifested the promise of that
[1:09:17] hour when it fell upon Wesley it
[1:09:19] manifested the promise of that hour when
[1:09:22] it falls in this day it manifests the
[1:09:24] promise of this hour when it fell upon
[1:09:27] Moses it manifested the promise of that
[1:09:29] hour
[1:09:30] listen it fell upon Noah
[1:09:32] it manifested the promise of that hour
[1:09:37] when it fell Upon Jesus it manifests the
[1:09:40] promise of that hour
[1:09:41] he said it's the Holy Spirit coming down
[1:09:44] to Quicken make alive those people
[1:09:47] that's for ordained listen to this part
[1:09:49] it's four ordained of God to be in the
[1:09:52] rapture
[1:09:53] nobody else was gonna be quicker like
[1:09:55] this but you that are ordained
[1:09:57] foreordained for a Rapture must be
[1:09:59] quickened by the spirit he said you are
[1:10:02] four ordained he said fell upon uh and
[1:10:04] and he said this excuse me when it fell
[1:10:06] Upon Jesus it manifest the promise of
[1:10:08] that hour see it's the Holy Spirit
[1:10:10] coming down to Quicken and make alive
[1:10:13] those people that's for ordained of God
[1:10:15] to be in the Rapture he said notice if
[1:10:18] he is a true Eagle he will understand
[1:10:21] the message of the hour if he's a true
[1:10:23] Eagle now the little Eagle probably in
[1:10:25] the barnyard was eating all right but he
[1:10:27] knowed it wasn't just exactly right but
[1:10:30] when he heard the truth when he received
[1:10:33] this truth he's noticed the very message
[1:10:36] of the Gospel itself is to prove to the
[1:10:39] people that he has risen the very gospel
[1:10:42] the very good news that we're preaching
[1:10:44] here today is not to tell you about a
[1:10:46] Jesus that just died but we are here to
[1:10:49] tell you that the same woman that died
[1:10:50] his Spirit came back into the church to
[1:10:53] raise you up it didn't just come to show
[1:10:56] you that a man could die and could raise
[1:10:58] himself again what good would that do
[1:11:00] for us brother Brandon speaks about it
[1:11:02] in the rising of the sun he said what
[1:11:04] good would it do to point to A Jesus of
[1:11:06] 2000 years ago if we couldn't point to
[1:11:09] the fact that he's still living now
[1:11:11] [Applause]
[1:11:14] there's no reason to point to just a god
[1:11:16] of history but we're pointing to what he
[1:11:19] did to show you what he'll do we're
[1:11:21] showing you what his attributes were in
[1:11:24] Jesus we're showing you what his
[1:11:25] attributes were Brother Bear talked
[1:11:27] about an Enoch and in Elijah and so
[1:11:29] forth to show you the attributes that we
[1:11:31] have today
[1:11:33] he said notice the very message he said
[1:11:34] go tell my disciples I'm risen from the
[1:11:37] dead and I'll meet with them to confirm
[1:11:39] this to them he said oh God how in this
[1:11:41] last day there shall be light again
[1:11:44] across the Earth and he said I'll prove
[1:11:46] to my disciples go tell them I'm not
[1:11:49] dead I'm not a tradition but I'm a
[1:11:51] living Christ I'll meet them and he said
[1:11:54] take this message to my disciples that
[1:11:56] I'm risen from the dead I'd like to tell
[1:11:58] you today young men young preachers that
[1:12:01] we are ordained to take this message and
[1:12:04] go tell the world that he is not dead
[1:12:06] but this message is proving a resurrect
[1:12:09] to Jesus today
[1:12:12] we're not here to preach tradition we're
[1:12:14] not here to preach just to make people
[1:12:16] feel good but we're here to show you
[1:12:18] that the Living God of the Bible is
[1:12:21] still living today
[1:12:23] he's still alive he's still Among Us
[1:12:25] brother Branham goes on he he quotes
[1:12:27] Hebrews 13 8 again
[1:12:30] he said we his beneficiaries are to
[1:12:34] prove his life is in US
[1:12:37] now the beneficiaries of this life the
[1:12:39] life there never was a life life lived
[1:12:42] like it he was the son of God and he
[1:12:45] died and that shut it out but when he
[1:12:48] raised again from the dead on Easter
[1:12:49] morning then we as his servants are
[1:12:52] commissioned by him to go into all the
[1:12:55] world and to bring this good news to
[1:12:57] every person
[1:13:00] that he is a living and now we can do it
[1:13:03] by the he said how can we do it by word
[1:13:06] only my brother Brandon would actually
[1:13:07] take this and you'll hear in a couple
[1:13:09] places where he talks about word only
[1:13:11] and he talks about it in a good manner
[1:13:13] because the word produces all these
[1:13:15] things that's right I hope you
[1:13:17] understand that the word is what the
[1:13:19] gifts themselves are in the word
[1:13:21] so the word only is okay but you must
[1:13:24] have the power within you to even
[1:13:26] understand the word if you don't have
[1:13:28] the Holy Ghost in you and you're coming
[1:13:29] trying to reveal the message to me then
[1:13:31] I'm going to highly doubt that you know
[1:13:33] what you're talking about but if the
[1:13:35] Holy Ghost has come in you and then the
[1:13:37] message has crossed your path then the
[1:13:39] Holy Spirit Will Reveal to you the
[1:13:42] understanding of the message
[1:13:45] brother Brandon goes on he said the
[1:13:47] gospel came out by word only but through
[1:13:49] the power and the manifestation of the
[1:13:50] Holy Spirit to prove that he is alive
[1:13:52] now if there is another gospel as Paul
[1:13:55] as Paul spoke to one of the groups he
[1:13:57] said I am so surprised that you turn to
[1:13:59] another gospel which there is no other
[1:14:01] but a make-believe gospel to a
[1:14:04] denominational fiction turning from that
[1:14:06] good news he said and because I live you
[1:14:09] live also this is the good news he's
[1:14:11] talking about in John 14 12 we just read
[1:14:13] the works that I do will identify myself
[1:14:16] in you he is being identified reflecting
[1:14:20] through you by the same works that he
[1:14:23] did
[1:14:24] I hope you see it today I'm not going to
[1:14:27] keep you all day I'm about done
[1:14:29] he said the works that I do will
[1:14:31] identify myself in you what a message he
[1:14:33] said no wonder we've had a dark world of
[1:14:35] theology
[1:14:36] but in the evening time there shall come
[1:14:39] light again remember we've went through
[1:14:41] the Dark Ages and we've seen what the
[1:14:43] Dark Ages will produce it'll produce a
[1:14:45] Catholic Church it'll produce another
[1:14:47] Westland or a Lutheran but in the
[1:14:49] evening line it would produce a bride
[1:14:52] called the body of Jesus Christ I dare
[1:14:54] you to disbelieve it today I dare you to
[1:14:56] say that there's not a living body today
[1:14:58] because I can show you a word that has
[1:15:01] been revealed to us that lines up
[1:15:03] perfectly with the scriptures in the New
[1:15:05] Testament
[1:15:07] I can show you where the same thing Paul
[1:15:09] taught is the same thing we're teaching
[1:15:11] today I can show you by the messenger of
[1:15:14] light that we have when we know what
[1:15:16] we're talking about because the spirit
[1:15:18] has come in this day and revealed the
[1:15:20] truth to us I hope you're hearing me
[1:15:22] today the word has power to change lives
[1:15:25] the word has the power to raise you up
[1:15:27] because it did it once I hope you hear
[1:15:30] me and if Jesus at the grave of Lazarus
[1:15:32] was the word made flesh then the word
[1:15:35] made flesh today will do the very same
[1:15:37] thing that the word made flesh then did
[1:15:41] can you say Amen if the word was made
[1:15:43] flesh then and it did those works we can
[1:15:47] do the same today because we are the
[1:15:49] word made flesh today
[1:15:52] Amen brother Branham said I'm afraid
[1:15:54] today that too many of us are not
[1:15:55] getting people to Christ
[1:15:57] we're getting them to a church to a
[1:15:59] theory but we must get them to Christ
[1:16:01] what is Christ the word
[1:16:03] he said he is the only one and the only
[1:16:06] one that has life you want life back in
[1:16:09] the church let's get Christ back in the
[1:16:11] church you want Christ in your home
[1:16:13] let's kick out the television and put
[1:16:15] Christ back in the home you want Christ
[1:16:17] to rule over your life then quit letting
[1:16:20] something else rule over you quit that
[1:16:22] in the darkness and the powers of this
[1:16:24] evil age rule over you but let Christ
[1:16:26] rule your life you want a living body
[1:16:28] that's how to have one but Christ's back
[1:16:30] in the body
[1:16:31] [Music]
[1:16:33] he said he that has the son has life the
[1:16:36] Bible says that
[1:16:38] and if the life of a man that's dead be
[1:16:40] projected in you you will live the same
[1:16:42] life he lived if the blood of a man was
[1:16:45] a certain type and you took the blood
[1:16:47] from one man and changed the blood of
[1:16:49] the one man into another he would
[1:16:50] absolutely be that type to blood if your
[1:16:53] spirit that's in you is reckoned dead
[1:16:55] and you are anointed with the life that
[1:16:58] was in Christ is upon you and he goes on
[1:17:01] to say Romans 8 11 again he said if the
[1:17:04] spirit that raised up Christ from the
[1:17:05] dead dwells in you it also quickens your
[1:17:08] mortal body he said that same life them
[1:17:10] same Powers them same beneficiaries that
[1:17:14] he had here on Earth from God he
[1:17:17] redeemed you a seed that was foreknown
[1:17:20] by God whose names was put on the Lamb's
[1:17:22] Book of Life before the foundation of
[1:17:24] the world and that's some shout material
[1:17:26] right there because your name was there
[1:17:29] before there ever was a fall your name
[1:17:31] was there before there was ever a sin
[1:17:33] that you committed your name always has
[1:17:36] been on the Lamb's Book of Life and I'll
[1:17:39] tell you what if it's there it can't be
[1:17:41] taken off if your name was put there
[1:17:43] then no man can take it off no Prophet
[1:17:46] can take it off nobody can take it off
[1:17:49] because it was there before there ever
[1:17:51] was an earth before there was ever a
[1:17:53] foundation of the world or somebody
[1:17:56] ought to say praise the Lord somebody
[1:17:58] ought to say my name's there
[1:17:59] yeah
[1:18:00] if you know your name's there it takes a
[1:18:02] lot of Doubt away from you it takes a
[1:18:04] lot of fear away from your life because
[1:18:06] you can see who you were in the word of
[1:18:09] God because you always were a Son of God
[1:18:12] you just had to be quickened in this
[1:18:15] hour to the newness of life oh I hope
[1:18:17] you're hearing me this is not just
[1:18:19] another message but it can take another
[1:18:21] dead church member that was sitting out
[1:18:23] there in a Pentecostal church maybe they
[1:18:25] were dancing maybe they were shouting
[1:18:27] and that's okay maybe you were having a
[1:18:29] good time but when the word come into
[1:18:30] your life it took you from just another
[1:18:33] shower from just another Runner and it
[1:18:35] made a word believe in body of Christ
[1:18:37] out of you
[1:18:39] it made you not just act good in church
[1:18:41] but it made you good on Monday morning
[1:18:43] it made you good on Tuesday morning it
[1:18:46] made your life line up with the gospel
[1:18:48] oh I hope you hear me today I'm just
[1:18:50] about done but let me just go and say
[1:18:52] this just before we close brother
[1:18:54] Branham is showing the quickening power
[1:18:56] to the people
[1:18:58] but I like how this ends because brother
[1:19:00] Branham is showing
[1:19:02] the power and he's calling the people
[1:19:04] out but then at the end of this quote I
[1:19:07] want you to notice that he talks he
[1:19:09] challenges the people to put their hands
[1:19:10] on each other because he wants you to
[1:19:12] know it wasn't just for him
[1:19:15] now the gift was just for him to show
[1:19:17] you at the gift that must come it had to
[1:19:20] fulfill prophecy it had to fulfill the
[1:19:22] word the gift had to come in one man but
[1:19:24] then you had to see the word that came
[1:19:26] was to produce a body that would live by
[1:19:29] the same word that he was bringing to
[1:19:30] the people and so here's a lady he said
[1:19:33] looking right down here he said through
[1:19:35] here sitting looking at me she's got
[1:19:37] heart trouble do you believe that God
[1:19:38] will heal the heart trouble you were
[1:19:40] sitting there praying he said I wish oh
[1:19:42] you were sitting there praying I wish I
[1:19:44] could get there is that right wave your
[1:19:46] hand like this that's right how did I
[1:19:48] know what you were saying in your prayer
[1:19:51] he said just believe that's all you have
[1:19:54] to do is believe he goes on he said
[1:19:56] here's this lady here that'll die right
[1:19:58] away if she isn't healed she's got
[1:20:00] cancer
[1:20:02] he said do you believe that God will
[1:20:03] heal the cancer yes you believe it
[1:20:06] you being that was kind of slow putting
[1:20:08] up your hand do you believe that God can
[1:20:10] tell me who you are
[1:20:12] now he must have noticed when she was a
[1:20:14] little slow putting her hand up that she
[1:20:16] might have wanted him to say something
[1:20:17] about her
[1:20:18] so he goes on and he says Mrs Gunn
[1:20:21] now if that's right wave your hand like
[1:20:23] that see all right go home Jesus Christ
[1:20:25] will make you well
[1:20:27] if thou can't believe all things are
[1:20:29] possible he said that struck this lady
[1:20:31] sitting here with a dark hat on looking
[1:20:33] at me she also has cancer do you believe
[1:20:36] God will heal you I want you to notice
[1:20:38] something real quick he was noted he was
[1:20:40] Discerning their thoughts but this woman
[1:20:42] was struck by something this woman had
[1:20:45] to get the attention of the Prophet by
[1:20:47] something the woman with the issue of
[1:20:49] blood she had to get the prophet's
[1:20:50] attention by something your faith has
[1:20:53] touched the prophet your faith has
[1:20:54] touched Christ and if it has then that
[1:20:57] same body of Christ can live because the
[1:21:00] quickening power is not just in a man
[1:21:02] but it is in the word of God it is a
[1:21:04] discerner of the thoughts and the hearts
[1:21:05] do you believe God will heal you do you
[1:21:07] believe with all your heart I'm speaking
[1:21:08] to Miss Miller he says do you believe
[1:21:10] that that do you believe that I don't
[1:21:12] know this woman never seen her in my
[1:21:14] life and God in heaven knows that's
[1:21:15] right he said if thou can't believe
[1:21:19] here is a colored woman sitting right
[1:21:20] over here on the end had her head down
[1:21:22] she was studying she's studying about a
[1:21:23] loved one somebody she's praying for you
[1:21:25] telling me this is just a man
[1:21:27] you're telling me this is just another
[1:21:29] man that can stand up there with a
[1:21:31] sideshow and and a one-trick pony no
[1:21:33] this was a man that was yielding himself
[1:21:36] to God and God speaking through a
[1:21:38] prophet in our day
[1:21:40] he said no he isn't here it's her
[1:21:42] husband that's right she's not here he's
[1:21:44] at home he's had an operation hasn't he
[1:21:46] that's right he was bothered with sinus
[1:21:48] trouble and so forth that's true he's
[1:21:50] going to be all right your faith was
[1:21:52] strong for it do you believe that to be
[1:21:54] true he said can't you see that Jesus
[1:21:57] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:21:58] forever he said ask those people it's
[1:22:00] went Plum across the audience do you
[1:22:02] believe that he's here do you feel that
[1:22:04] quickening power in you I love how he
[1:22:08] puts a tear do you feel that quickening
[1:22:10] power in you he said well that's the god
[1:22:13] that makes you well friends it wasn't
[1:22:15] brother Branham he's pointing you to the
[1:22:17] god that makes you well it was your
[1:22:20] faith that touched him it was you you
[1:22:23] have the ability to touch god with your
[1:22:25] faith
[1:22:27] he said now will you do one thing for me
[1:22:28] how many in here is sick let's see you
[1:22:31] raise your hand I wonder if you could do
[1:22:32] that today if there's somebody in here
[1:22:34] that's not feeling well maybe there's
[1:22:35] financial trouble could you raise your
[1:22:36] hand today I wonder if there's one
[1:22:38] person in here that says you have a need
[1:22:40] of God if you can put your hand up
[1:22:41] because the same God is here today he
[1:22:44] said how many is here sick let's see
[1:22:46] your hand he said now he said it's it's
[1:22:48] time to close is what he's saying it is
[1:22:50] for me I'm in the red he said now it's
[1:22:51] going he said Lay Your Hands over on
[1:22:53] each other
[1:22:54] brother branding is challenging I wonder
[1:22:56] if we could stand together now and do
[1:22:58] the same thing as musicians come I
[1:22:59] wonder if we could be challenged to the
[1:23:01] same Faith it's not just for a Prophet
[1:23:04] come on church it's not just for 1963
[1:23:07] 1964 1965 but it's for you today I
[1:23:12] wonder if you can put your hands on
[1:23:14] somebody he said now he said don't don't
[1:23:16] say a word now just lay your hands on
[1:23:18] one another he said I want you to do
[1:23:20] something any brother Brandon goes on he
[1:23:22] said the man sitting back here has a
[1:23:23] growth on his back do you believe that
[1:23:25] God will make that growth off your back
[1:23:26] Sir he said do you believe that God will
[1:23:28] make you well young fellow you're
[1:23:29] looking at me he said thought he was
[1:23:31] going to get passed by raise up your
[1:23:33] hand that's right he said you believe
[1:23:34] with all your heart brother Branham goes
[1:23:36] on he said I challenge this whole
[1:23:38] audience in the name of Jesus Christ if
[1:23:41] your conscience don't let you be seared
[1:23:43] with unbelief don't let it be frustrated
[1:23:45] can't you see the son of man the son of
[1:23:48] man in the form of a prophetic message
[1:23:50] returning back again in his church in
[1:23:52] Prophecy revealing Jesus Christ the same
[1:23:56] yesterday today and forever he said it's
[1:24:00] been done through the age till this time
[1:24:01] he says never been done until this time
[1:24:03] there is proof of it what is the church
[1:24:06] how do you get into it when you're in
[1:24:08] there everything that Jesus Christ was
[1:24:11] you are
[1:24:13] that's what I want you to see today it's
[1:24:15] not just for a prophet it's not just for
[1:24:18] another man it's not just for one single
[1:24:21] church but everything that Christ was is
[1:24:24] yours it's who you are it's my identity
[1:24:27] I'm reflecting him today can you say
[1:24:30] amen he became me so that I can become
[1:24:33] him
[1:24:35] his power is living in us today I wonder
[1:24:38] what your head's bowed
[1:24:40] closing
[1:24:42] just
[1:24:43] with your hands on one another
[1:24:48] if we could just ask the Lord don't pray
[1:24:51] for yourself
[1:24:53] the person next to you say Lord
[1:24:55] and this is something we all need
[1:24:57] Lord send a Revival fire in their life
[1:25:01] it's in the Revival in their home
[1:25:03] Quicken the word to them so that they
[1:25:06] know that Christ is not just a god of
[1:25:09] history but he's a god that is here now
[1:25:13] I wonder if we could just with all our
[1:25:14] hearts say Lord
[1:25:16] touch my brother touch my sisters give
[1:25:19] him a Revival fire in their heart may
[1:25:21] this church just feel an anointing audit
[1:25:24] we don't have to wait for something
[1:25:25] great to happen but the presence of the
[1:25:28] Holy Ghost is here today the Holy Ghost
[1:25:31] is Among Us don't settle for second best
[1:25:33] don't settle for somebody preaching that
[1:25:36] the message is a dead word but believe
[1:25:39] that today the quickening power is here
[1:25:41] Among Us
[1:25:43] can you believe with all your hearts
[1:25:47] he said brother bear said don't throw
[1:25:50] your denomination at me it won't work he
[1:25:53] said I know he's here I'm positive he's
[1:25:56] here I know that now there is quickening
[1:26:00] power enough in the church to heal every
[1:26:02] person that's sitting here I wonder if
[1:26:04] you know that today
[1:26:06] I wonder if you know that you know that
[1:26:10] the power that was in Jesus the power
[1:26:12] that was shown through a prophet is here
[1:26:15] today
[1:26:19] he said I'm positive to heal every
[1:26:22] person
[1:26:23] he said can you believe it
[1:26:25] he said well then will you do you
[1:26:28] believe in praying for the sick do you
[1:26:30] believe Jesus said lay hands on the sick
[1:26:32] and they shall recover he said all right
[1:26:34] put your hands over on the person and he
[1:26:37] said don't pray for yourself
[1:26:38] pray for that person next to you oh I
[1:26:41] wonder if all of our hearts now we can
[1:26:43] just
[1:26:43] pray to him and say Lord
[1:26:45] the person next to me they may not be my
[1:26:48] family they may not be someone that's
[1:26:51] done anything financially for me but
[1:26:53] Lord my heart goes out to them because
[1:26:55] they have a need of Revival in their
[1:26:58] life they are the child of God they are
[1:27:01] your son or daughter of God lord I pray
[1:27:04] you would come on this audience today
[1:27:06] Lord I pray you would send a Revival in
[1:27:09] this church don't let us just have
[1:27:10] another service don't let us just have
[1:27:12] another's time of singing and
[1:27:14] celebration but let us know that we know
[1:27:17] that the body of Christ is here and we
[1:27:20] are living out the revelation of Jesus
[1:27:23] Christ in this hour oh I wonder if you
[1:27:25] could just say with all your hearts now
[1:27:27] say thank you Jesus say thank you Jesus
[1:27:30] for the power of God in this hour thank
[1:27:33] you Lord for saving my soul thank you
