[26:56] to be your house so grateful that you
[26:59] are God and father that your sovereignty
[27:03] means that everything is in your hands
[27:07] father you knew where we would be this
[27:10] morning what we would be listening to
[27:11] what the condition of our life would be
[27:14] as we come to this moment
[27:16] help us to grow in your word today and
[27:19] or just to drink in of the of the
[27:21] goodness of God the grace that you've
[27:24] given us the word of the hour may we
[27:27] continually grow father and not not stop
[27:30] or put a period Lord on on what we are
[27:32] and what we become but we know we've got
[27:34] further to go there's a road yet to walk
[27:38] Lord until that day when our body's
[27:40] changing so I pray Heavenly Father that
[27:43] you would just help us to become more
[27:45] like you father lord I pray for every
[27:48] request that was made these folks Lord
[27:50] that are here and those that are
[27:51] listening father by way of streaming I
[27:54] pray God that you would just move in
[27:56] their homes where they are God and we
[27:58] know that you're able to do that and
[28:00] you're not constricted like we are and
[28:03] so we ask you Father to touch them Lord
[28:06] I'd like to be able to go to each one of
[28:08] them and fellowship with them today and
[28:10] you know that's my heart my god I know
[28:12] that you can do that today and Lord and
[28:15] you can provide a fellowship that Lord
[28:18] that can be beyond anything that we can
[28:20] have humanly I prayed that you bless the
[28:22] word today and all that said or done we
[28:24] ask in Jesus
[28:26] amen amen god bless you turn with me if
[28:31] you would to John chapter six verse 63
[28:35] we'll just read that one verse John
[28:37] chapter six verse 63 it's good to be
[28:43] fellowshipping around the word this
[28:45] morning we posted on the internet but we
[28:55] are going to try to do our best reopen
[28:58] the church in a timely manner so y'all
[29:01] just bear with us thank you for for
[29:03] being with us for being a part of those
[29:04] that have come and helped and those that
[29:07] those that have been unable to come but
[29:10] want to be here and I know that you do
[29:12] and you that are watching I know that
[29:14] you want to be here and and so we
[29:16] appreciate that and and nothing would
[29:19] thrill my heart more than to see
[29:20] everybody here this morning but it won't
[29:22] be very long we're planning if
[29:25] everything continues to go as it is and
[29:27] there's not any more problems or
[29:29] planning on trying to reopen on May the
[29:32] 3rd but there will be some restrictions
[29:33] and things we still have to deal with
[29:35] and so you just keep praying with us we
[29:37] believe God is good to us and allows us
[29:40] to do the things that we need to do and
[29:42] and guides us to do the right things at
[29:45] the right time so we're gonna follow the
[29:47] leadership of the Lord and use our
[29:49] brains as well and use common sense and
[29:51] and I'm glad that we've all stayed safe
[29:54] through this and I know there's been
[29:56] time so some of you do work jobs and
[29:58] things where you could have been exposed
[29:59] but you've been able to be safe and I
[30:01] appreciate that and we want to thank God
[30:04] for that also
[30:06] Joanna's birthday today and over the
[30:08] David already mentioned that and the
[30:10] reason I'm bringing it up again is
[30:12] because I noticed on my calendar that
[30:15] brother Joe's birthday was on the
[30:17] calendar at home my kids put it on there
[30:19] so they found out his birthday and put
[30:22] it on our calendar they didn't have
[30:24] yours on their sister join us you've got
[30:25] a little work to do there so they had
[30:29] Jose put on there I thought that was
[30:30] interesting I don't think they had mine
[30:32] on there but they've got Jojo they've
[30:34] got your birthday on the calendar at
[30:35] home
[30:37] alright let's read from John chapter 6
[30:40] and verse 63 it is the spirit that
[30:43] quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing
[30:47] the words that I speak unto you they are
[30:49] spirit and they are life
[30:52] she grateful for his word this morning I
[30:54] want to speak to you on the elements of
[30:56] the Christian life and I pray the Lord
[30:58] would add his blessing to the word as
[31:00] you're seated this morning an element is
[31:05] the simplest principle of a thing it's
[31:09] its most basic part we know that the
[31:13] elements in water are hydrogen and
[31:15] oxygen and if you just have one you
[31:18] don't have water right he takes both to
[31:21] make water and both elements are
[31:23] necessary and it's h2o I think it's two
[31:26] parts hydrogen one part oxygen or maybe
[31:28] vice versa if I was making water I might
[31:31] not be able to do that but but you know
[31:33] there's an elements that have to be
[31:36] there and as you look at the Christian
[31:38] life there's some things that have to be
[31:41] in the Christian life and we find that
[31:44] people today there's countless people
[31:46] who have a desire to live right I think
[31:48] there's people that are on the earth
[31:50] today that want to do the right things
[31:53] and they want to live right they want to
[31:56] have a the ability to overcome their
[32:00] problems and the situations of their
[32:02] life that they're dealing with and they
[32:03] just can't seem to do it they just can't
[32:05] seem to live in overcomers life and they
[32:08] try to take the word and maybe millions
[32:10] around the world have the Bible and read
[32:14] it and want to do the things that are
[32:16] written in the Bible but many times
[32:18] they're unable to for whatever reason
[32:19] and of course you know there's
[32:21] Hippocrates there's make believers but I
[32:22] believe there's people who really want
[32:25] to do it but yet they don't know how or
[32:27] there's something that that's keeping
[32:29] them from doing that there's something
[32:31] that's lacking and it's like brother
[32:34] Branham talked about the mechanics and
[32:36] the dynamics it's like there's something
[32:38] missing that they're unable to make it
[32:40] work
[32:40] and that's what I want to talk about
[32:42] this morning is those elements that make
[32:44] the Christian life actually work and so
[32:49] you
[32:50] today that living a Christian life when
[32:52] we think about that many times we think
[32:53] about just living a good life and we
[32:55] think about living a sanctified life
[32:58] when we think about living a Christian
[33:00] life not smoking not drinking not doing
[33:02] those things and that's part of it
[33:04] there's part of being a Christian but
[33:06] there's more to being a Christian than
[33:07] just that because if that's all it takes
[33:09] to be a Christian then the Pope
[33:11] qualifies and then others there's others
[33:14] that would qualify that as well and so
[33:17] but they don't have what it takes to
[33:19] live like Christ to me and and I think I
[33:22] can prove this by the word that living a
[33:24] Christian life is to manifest the word
[33:27] of the hour and we could put it this way
[33:30] to make the word work that's supposed to
[33:33] work in the hour that you live in it's
[33:37] not only sanctification it's not only
[33:39] manifestation but it's sanctification
[33:42] and manifestation together that brings
[33:45] out a life that lives through you it's
[33:47] not something that you put on but it's
[33:49] something that you just are and so you
[33:52] just actually do the things that you're
[33:55] supposed to do in the hour that you live
[33:57] in and you believe the word that you are
[34:00] supposed to believe because that's how
[34:02] you do what you do because of what you
[34:04] believe so we find that that should be
[34:07] evident in our lives in acts 4:13 they
[34:10] looked at the boldness of Peter and John
[34:12] and perceived that they were unlearned
[34:13] and ignorant men and it says they
[34:16] marveled and they took knowledge of them
[34:18] that they had been with Jesus and you
[34:21] know I think it ought to be evident in
[34:23] our lives as well that that we've been
[34:26] with Christ that there's been a
[34:28] resurrection take place in our lives
[34:30] that were different than what we were so
[34:34] they said these men have been with Jesus
[34:35] and it wasn't because they'll just live
[34:38] better lives because the Pharisees live
[34:39] better lives but these men had been with
[34:42] Jesus because they had the boldness to
[34:45] speak the word of their hour they were
[34:47] living and manifesting the very word
[34:49] that was spoken about them and I believe
[34:52] today that there's a people on the face
[34:55] of the earth that are actually
[34:56] manifesting the word that is spoken
[34:58] about us that there's somebody but the
[35:01] Harvey that's willing to put
[35:02] action and manifest the word that was
[35:05] given for this day so it's a
[35:09] manifestation now but the random tells
[35:12] us in in a message called is your life
[35:14] worthy of the gospel he says no the only
[35:17] way to live a life worthy is to let
[35:19] Christ and His Word which he is the word
[35:23] reflect itself so perfect in you till
[35:27] God vindicates what he said in the word
[35:30] for Christ died that he might present
[35:33] himself before God a sacrifice and then
[35:36] return back in the form of the Holy
[35:37] Spirit to reflect himself through his
[35:40] people to carry on his work reflecting
[35:45] himself through you to fulfill his
[35:48] promised word like the way he puts this
[35:50] in these future days so he's fulfilling
[35:54] his word in these future days whatever
[35:58] word is written about us and just to
[36:00] kind of make it where we could
[36:02] understand it this morning you know
[36:04] there was a time when it took a certain
[36:06] amount of power to move an automobile
[36:09] because the mechanics of that automobile
[36:12] were simple and so it took a certain
[36:14] amount of power to be able to move that
[36:16] and it was an amount that and you say
[36:21] well what amount is right well whatever
[36:22] amount it takes to move the wheels and
[36:24] to make it operate the way it's supposed
[36:26] to so if you went and got a 1956 Chevy
[36:30] and you could have maybe low horsepower
[36:33] compared to what you would have today
[36:35] and but yet it would be it would have
[36:37] the power that it needed and maybe even
[36:39] use a different type of gasoline er I
[36:42] believe leaded gasoline or whatever but
[36:44] it would be different than what we have
[36:45] today and it's because the mechanics
[36:49] have improved on the automobile now we
[36:52] know that God doesn't change but he does
[36:55] add things that we didn't know yesterday
[36:58] to what we know today right so the word
[37:02] if you could look at it this way that
[37:04] they had and brother Branham types it to
[37:06] the horse and buggy and then he typed it
[37:09] to the automobile is still
[37:10] transportation but it's just a different
[37:13] method of transportation but you
[37:15] still he's just revealing more of
[37:17] himself so if you can take automobiles
[37:20] you could take a 56 Chevy and move that
[37:22] up to today they're quite a bit
[37:24] different and it takes a maybe a
[37:26] different mixture maybe use fuel
[37:28] injectors instead of a carburetor you're
[37:30] doing something a little bit different
[37:31] to make it work but the right the
[37:34] elements are still there are the basic
[37:36] elements of a of an engine or still have
[37:39] to be there in order to make it work
[37:41] right and so the word of this day is not
[37:45] a horse and buggy but it's actually a
[37:48] it's actually a spaceship put it that
[37:52] way a rocket and ship and so it takes a
[37:55] certain mixture of fuel to be able to
[37:58] get that rocket ship off the ground and
[38:00] you say well how do we know what that is
[38:02] well he provides that to us and we'll
[38:05] get into that that the word of the hour
[38:08] actually has the life in it that we need
[38:11] and God no he will not leave his word as
[38:16] a dead body I hope you understand this
[38:19] today that maybe yesterday's word there
[38:22] people who can take the word for Noah's
[38:24] day and understand that and believe it
[38:26] but we live in a different day and that
[38:29] word you could look at that but the
[38:30] ground looked at it as a a buzzard
[38:32] eating a carcass of yesterday but today
[38:36] we have a word for today and the holy
[38:39] spirit anoints that word and actually in
[38:41] dwells that word and comes on a living
[38:45] body a living church to make it do what
[38:47] it's supposed to do and then the church
[38:50] operates under that and it operates the
[38:53] way a church is supposed to operate at
[38:55] the end time are you with me so far now
[39:00] and so that's why many can't put it
[39:03] together but we've heard a message that
[39:06] we can live a Christian life we don't
[39:10] live the life of a cult somewhere we
[39:12] live a Christian life but it looks
[39:15] different from what the world lives
[39:16] because they can't put those elements
[39:19] together to make this machine of the
[39:21] word work in our day and you look at it
[39:25] look at the the message of Luther today
[39:27] or the message of Wesley or them
[39:29] to Pentecost it fails the people that
[39:32] believe in it and it fails the ones who
[39:35] hold to it the most it fails them the
[39:37] most because they've not moved on into
[39:40] another light and and so what happens is
[39:43] though they may be sincere it seems like
[39:45] it's a struggle for them and many of
[39:47] them may be sincerely will be a foolish
[39:50] virgin or they're in some way they're in
[39:52] the economy of God they're sincere in it
[39:54] but they don't under they just can't
[39:56] make it work but for us it's not making
[39:58] it work it just works right or it ought
[40:02] to be that way
[40:03] it just works oh my I'm so glad for a
[40:08] gospel that works this morning I'm so
[40:10] glad that it works wherever we're at if
[40:12] you're sitting out there today in your
[40:13] home and you're sitting there thinking
[40:14] well I'm not a preacher I'm not a singer
[40:17] I'm not anything else but it works where
[40:19] do you live
[40:20] the gospel works this machine of the
[40:22] gospel of the endtime gospel works in
[40:25] your life you can look back at what you
[40:28] were and you can look back at yesterday
[40:29] and you can say I'm not what I was
[40:32] because the word is working in my life
[40:34] that explosion has taken place that the
[40:38] meaning of the mechanics and the
[40:40] dynamics and the indwelling of the Holy
[40:41] Spirit has come and now I'm able to live
[40:44] it man it may be simple it may not be
[40:47] what everybody's looking for but I'm
[40:49] able to live the word for my day now so
[40:57] brother Branham says that we're return
[40:58] back in the form of the Holy Spirit and
[41:01] fulfill this promise word of these
[41:02] future days now
[41:03] in John 4:23 he says but the hour cometh
[41:09] and now is when the true worshipers
[41:11] shall worship the father in spirit and
[41:12] in truth but the father seeketh such to
[41:15] worship Him God is the spirit they that
[41:18] worship Him must worship Him in spirit
[41:19] and in truth these are the elements that
[41:21] it takes to make a Christian life
[41:23] brother Branham again calls this the
[41:25] mechanics and the dynamics or the word
[41:27] and the quickening power so it's the
[41:30] same thing it's just calling it
[41:32] something different now either element
[41:36] and I want us to understand this today
[41:38] because as a church as a people and
[41:42] I think that we we need to understand
[41:44] where we are and what we have because a
[41:47] lot of times people are looking for
[41:50] something different there were something
[41:52] more and I don't believe there is
[41:53] anything more and if you want to hear
[41:57] something more you're probably listening
[41:58] to the wrong preacher because I believe
[42:01] where it's going home time and I believe
[42:04] that it's getting just getting closer
[42:05] and closer and I believe there's more
[42:06] revelation as far as personal revelation
[42:09] when it comes to the Word of God we have
[42:12] what we need to go home so want us to
[42:15] understand that what we need or what we
[42:18] have is sufficient to make it work but
[42:25] it takes both these elements to make it
[42:26] work because you could take the message
[42:28] by itself or the Bible by itself and
[42:30] read it and become a student of it and
[42:33] understand it in the mind and it still
[42:36] wouldn't work but if you if that same
[42:39] scripture if those same quotes were
[42:41] quickened to you we're made alive to you
[42:45] then it would work because this is my
[42:47] scripture says the letter kill us but
[42:48] the Spirit bring his life and we can
[42:51] read it like this the letter alone
[42:52] killeth it takes both elements together
[42:55] it's also true that the Spirit by itself
[42:59] will not cannot produce a life worthy of
[43:03] the gospel and that that sounds strange
[43:07] but the Holy Spirit will anoint people
[43:10] but it cannot end well anything but the
[43:12] word right it can't come into your life
[43:15] and that's why so many people are
[43:16] looking looking for the Holy Ghost but
[43:19] if you're looking for the Holy Ghost
[43:20] give your heart to Christ repent and be
[43:23] baptized and follow Christ and and
[43:25] actually do or obey the Word of God and
[43:29] you'll receive the Holy Ghost because he
[43:31] comes to that temple that sanctified he
[43:34] comes to that person that is we could
[43:38] say has been awakened to the word and
[43:39] it's the Holy Ghost that does that but
[43:42] then it's the Holy Ghost that indwells
[43:44] the person and he will not end well
[43:46] anyone that is not the word I'm going to
[43:50] show that to you in just a moment
[43:51] there's got to be some part of you and
[43:54] I'm so grateful that when we fail or
[43:56] when
[43:56] we don't do what's right that we have to
[43:58] realize that we would not have the Holy
[44:00] Ghost today if there was not some part
[44:02] of us that was the word because he won't
[44:06] come to anything but the word now but
[44:11] it's not this flesh our flesh it's not
[44:14] the word we are not Emmanuel he was and
[44:18] I'm kind of getting ahead of myself
[44:19] today but just just bear with me because
[44:22] I'm I'm thinking about this while I'm
[44:24] while I'm preaching to you and I've been
[44:25] praying about it now for days and and
[44:27] just trying to think how to bring it to
[44:30] us that we would understand because we
[44:33] need something that works and we need
[44:35] something that's real we need something
[44:37] that's alive but yet we could go and if
[44:41] you just put that on manifestation of
[44:43] the Spirit that jumping and shouting and
[44:45] there's lots of churches that shout more
[44:47] than we do lots of churches that jump
[44:50] more than we do around the house and
[44:51] that's wonderful you know I'd run the
[44:53] Isles too I love it but you know when it
[44:57] comes down to it that's the effects of
[44:59] his presence that's his anointing but
[45:03] what you have to have to make it out of
[45:05] here is the indwelling of the Spirit
[45:07] because you will come and anoint an
[45:09] entire church and you've seen it work
[45:11] you have three kinds of believers you
[45:13] know sinners and saints sitting together
[45:15] and the Saints rejoice and the sinners
[45:18] rejoice and everyone together begins to
[45:22] rejoice in the presence of God but what
[45:24] we want is to get out of here and in
[45:26] order to get out of here we actually
[45:28] have to have him not just anointing us
[45:30] but indwelling us so there's got to be
[45:35] something that will work in our lives
[45:38] not just the effects of his presence not
[45:42] just as we've referenced recently but
[45:44] Elijah hearing the whirlwind or seeing
[45:46] the fire whatever that it was he saw
[45:50] those things and those were effects of
[45:52] his presence but he waited until he
[45:55] heard the still small voice for the
[45:56] cabin when he heard it then he knew God
[45:58] was speaking because the Holy Spirit
[46:02] only comes to the word now so you might
[46:08] ask the question
[46:10] which is more important the Holy Spirit
[46:13] or the word the mechanics or the
[46:16] dynamics the word of the quickening
[46:19] power which is more important I'll ask
[46:22] you this if you go out to your car and
[46:26] you want to drive somewhere you got
[46:27] somewhere to be
[46:28] what's more important the battery or the
[46:31] gasoline you need both right you need a
[46:35] spark now maybe you can start your car
[46:38] like my grandpa you start his tractor
[46:39] and roll it down the hill and pop the
[46:41] clutch always parked his tractor on a
[46:43] hill and just pop the clutch and maybe
[46:46] you can start your car like that but but
[46:48] you need a spark and you need gasoline
[46:52] to be able to run it so you'd say well
[46:56] we'll happen we have more of the spirit
[46:58] or we have more of the word well it's
[46:59] actually the same thing because what we
[47:02] need is Holy Ghost filled people then
[47:05] you have the spirit and the word right
[47:06] now the key is not to have we say well
[47:11] we have more of the spirit or we have
[47:12] more of the word but the key is to have
[47:14] the spirit and the spirit and enough
[47:17] power in our lives to make the mechanics
[47:19] of our age the word of our age run it's
[47:23] got to be able to operate it's got to be
[47:26] able to move and the word they put it
[47:28] down on a basic way the word and the
[47:30] spirit in us shouldn't it could make a
[47:33] shout it could make us speak in tongues
[47:35] but it will make it work in our lives so
[47:39] it'll make a church work the word and
[47:42] the spirit together in your life will be
[47:45] able to operate if you have the office
[47:46] of a deacon or trustee or or if you're a
[47:49] musician or if you're just a housewife
[47:51] or or if you're a factory worker the
[47:53] word will operate in you so that the
[47:56] church can benefit from you being there
[47:59] right that's the word and the spirit
[48:01] actually working together and you don't
[48:05] realize that and you say well I don't
[48:07] run the aisles but maybe you you
[48:09] faithfully support the church and you
[48:11] faithfully come and you're faithful to
[48:13] be there in the same man or however that
[48:15] you can do it and you don't realize that
[48:17] you're making the church work all right
[48:21] you're making the church work and so
[48:22] just
[48:23] as much as the preacher is just as much
[48:25] as the musicians are just as much as the
[48:27] song leader of the Deacons you make the
[48:29] church work and if you have the Holy
[48:32] Spirit then you have what it takes in
[48:34] you to make you're part of the body work
[48:38] with the other members of the body and
[48:40] it won't produce a church a
[48:43] denominational Church a church of
[48:45] another day but it'll produce a church
[48:47] of the word and this day right now so
[48:54] the key is that we have to have the same
[48:56] spirit and the same word even though we
[48:59] have more revelation of it today boy
[49:01] it's the same word and the same spirit
[49:04] that he had because we want a
[49:06] resurrection like he had now Romans 8:11
[49:11] and we've read this I think every week
[49:13] recently but he said if the spirit of
[49:15] him that raised up Jesus from the dead
[49:17] dwell in you he that raised up Christ
[49:18] from the dead shall also quicken your
[49:20] mortal bodies by his Spirit that
[49:23] dwelleth in you in other words it'll
[49:25] make you alive it'll work and I know I'm
[49:30] bearing down on that but I just wanted
[49:31] us to get that and so I kept reminding
[49:33] myself of that in my notes it'll work it
[49:36] must not only be the anointing of the
[49:38] spirit but the Spirit has got to dwell
[49:41] in it it won't just have works it won't
[49:43] just have works
[49:45] it won't just have numbers but it'll
[49:48] manifest the word for the day however
[49:51] that is and it'll manifest it under
[49:53] distress under persecution you look at
[49:57] that first age how that the the enemy
[50:00] come against them and and look during
[50:02] the Dark Age if how the enemy came and
[50:04] just destroyed them but the word still
[50:07] worked the anointing that they were
[50:09] under anointed the word for their day
[50:11] and it worked and it'll work today it'll
[50:14] work for a family that's struggling to
[50:16] get by the word and the Spirit will work
[50:18] in your life it'll work for it'll work
[50:21] for a church that maybe it is small and
[50:25] not as big as some others but the word
[50:26] will still work it's still effective
[50:29] they'll still lay hands on the sick and
[50:30] they shall recover
[50:31] it's you'll still see healing you'll
[50:33] still see the Word of God manifested why
[50:36] because the word still works just like
[50:38] it did back then
[50:40] so the anointing of our day works to
[50:44] produce the Word of God in our lives now
[50:48] I want you to understand this morning
[50:49] that the Spirit will only dwell in a
[50:53] word house and I'm trying to refrain
[50:56] from saying are you with me because a
[50:58] little hard for those on the internet to
[51:00] tell me that but you know I trust that
[51:03] you are with me this morning wherever
[51:04] you're at button but it's got to dwell
[51:10] in a word house I mean let me reiterate
[51:11] that the word or the spirit will only
[51:15] dwell in a word house you know there's
[51:19] some motels that you won't stay in
[51:21] something that I won't stay in and we
[51:25] may have a different standard but
[51:26] there's some there's some that I you
[51:28] know just try not to stay in if I'm not
[51:31] in the foreign country and I have
[51:32] choices I'll go down the street right
[51:35] and so there's some places some houses
[51:37] maybe you wouldn't live in some cars you
[51:40] wouldn't drive you have standards and
[51:41] the Holy Ghost has standards and his
[51:45] standard is that he will not live in an
[51:50] unclean house and not only is it people
[51:53] do not live in an unclean house because
[51:55] you know there are those who clean up
[51:57] and then the devil comes right back in
[52:00] because they're not filled and Jesus
[52:03] told us that in the parables but yet
[52:05] there are there has to be someone who
[52:08] not only has cleaned up but is the work
[52:13] so there has to be well he will only
[52:16] dwell in a house that the word built and
[52:19] you can go back and if you want to get
[52:20] real technical with it you can go back
[52:22] to - to Moses when he saw a pattern of
[52:27] the tabernacle in the heavens he
[52:29] couldn't just build it anyway he wanted
[52:31] to but it had to be built a certain way
[52:34] a pattern had to be shown that they
[52:38] would build everything just the way they
[52:39] should and then if you go to David's
[52:43] time there had to be a pattern and then
[52:45] God revealed to David you'll find the
[52:48] pattern
[52:48] the house of God and then Solomon built
[52:51] that house but it was by revelation it
[52:54] had to be patterned brother Brown tells
[52:55] us it was patterned after the one in
[52:56] heaven that there had to be a pattern he
[53:00] would not come into something that was
[53:02] not patterned according to the word and
[53:05] and our lives have to be patterned
[53:08] according to the word but let me tell
[53:10] you what he comes into because you might
[53:12] say then well what what about the ones
[53:14] on the day of Pentecost who received the
[53:15] Holy Ghost knowing nothing and all they
[53:18] knew was to be baptized and they
[53:19] received the Holy Ghost and many find
[53:21] many examples of people who received the
[53:23] Holy Ghost without coming through a
[53:25] bunch of steps and jumping through a
[53:26] bunch of Hoops how is that even possible
[53:28] well it's possible because it's not
[53:33] what's in an order it's not your flesh
[53:36] but what's in order is the seed and that
[53:41] seed has been awakened by the Holy
[53:43] Spirit so he says repent and be baptized
[53:46] every one of you in the name of Jesus
[53:48] Christ in order for you to believe what
[53:50] he said and follow those directions
[53:52] there has to be something wakening
[53:54] inside of you and then if you follow
[53:56] those directions and believe what he
[53:57] said there must be some word there that
[54:00] was had an ability to be awakened so he
[54:03] comes to that so he doesn't wait I hope
[54:06] we understand this today he doesn't wait
[54:08] till we're perfect to give us the Holy
[54:09] Ghost he doesn't wait even till were
[54:12] mature to give us the Holy Ghost but he
[54:14] gives us the Holy Ghost and then matures
[54:17] us by the Holy Ghost he gives us the
[54:20] Holy Ghost and then he grows through us
[54:23] by the Holy Ghost I hope you're with me
[54:27] now now so there's got to be somebody
[54:31] who the spirit would dwell in the act
[54:36] 7:48 system Most High dwelleth not in
[54:38] temples made with hands so he comes to
[54:41] dwell in a body you know you go back to
[54:44] the dove that Noah released from the ark
[54:46] and the Dove would not land on a dead
[54:49] body and the devil is the type for the
[54:52] Holy Spirit it flew out there and there
[54:54] was carcasses laying in the water and he
[54:57] sent out a crow and the old crow just
[54:59] sat down on the carcass and started to
[55:01] eat
[55:01] he was happy to be there but the dev
[55:05] wasn't happy like that that's the way a
[55:07] Christian his if he flies around he
[55:10] finds out the Holy Spirit in you will
[55:12] not settle on dead carcasses will not
[55:15] feed on those things so brother branham
[55:19] puts it this way he said in Hebrews
[55:21] chapter seven number one he says some of
[55:23] you people going to church and just
[55:25] living by your membership people still
[55:27] do that today
[55:28] that doesn't mean and this is that that
[55:31] quote and X quote some of you people
[55:33] going to church and just living by your
[55:34] membership he said you go out here and
[55:37] do everything in the world and then
[55:38] still go back and say yeah I belong to
[55:40] the church he said well that's a long
[55:43] ways from belonging to God and as I said
[55:46] people still do that today and it's just
[55:49] a message Church instead of a Baptist
[55:50] Church
[55:51] but that's belonging to this church or
[55:53] any other attending church that's not
[55:54] what makes you a Christian no more than
[55:57] it's been said many times being in a
[55:59] living in a garage makes you a car right
[56:02] but it's something that you are and so
[56:05] you go to church because of who you are
[56:07] but the branches but you see people
[56:10] doing that you can tell other good
[56:11] church members that's true you can still
[56:13] be a church member and do those things
[56:14] but you can't be a Christian and do them
[56:18] he said he said I said this morning the
[56:22] Old Crow ever was a hypocrite it's the
[56:24] crow him and the doubt said on the same
[56:26] Ark said in the same roost and the Old
[56:29] Crow was satisfied when he was turned
[56:31] loose and got out of that church oh my
[56:34] that he could go out there and set on
[56:36] one old dead carcass and call call and
[56:38] eat off this one eat off the horse eat
[56:40] off the count whatever it was he was
[56:42] satisfied with rotten flesh oh what the
[56:47] Dove couldn't do that but when Noah
[56:49] turned the dove loose she could find no
[56:51] rest for the soles of her feet she had
[56:54] listen to this she had just as much
[56:56] right to sit on a dead animal as the
[56:59] crow did just as much right but it was
[57:03] two different natures hey Ben one of
[57:08] them she was a dub to begin with he was
[57:10] a crow to begin with now
[57:15] so we know then that the Holy Spirit
[57:17] will not settle down will not dwell with
[57:21] corruption we find that even illustrated
[57:25] in the story of the resurrection because
[57:27] Jesus when he went into the grave he
[57:30] went in with this promise that he said
[57:31] I'll not suffer my Holy One to see
[57:32] corruption
[57:33] he was the word and there had to be a
[57:36] resurrection because the Holy Spirit
[57:38] that spirit that was in him which the
[57:41] Holy Spirit is the person of Christ the
[57:43] Spirit of Christ it would not dwell in a
[57:45] corrupted body and so brother Branham
[57:51] toasts the story and I'm kind of trying
[57:53] to go through this as I can and then
[57:55] we'll finish and I won't take as long as
[57:57] it sounds like I'm gonna take so just
[57:59] bear with me but but the random tells
[58:02] his Eagles score and he talks about how
[58:04] that the the farmer you know set a Eagle
[58:07] egg under a chicken and it hatched
[58:10] because the atmosphere was there for it
[58:13] to hatch and so it it went around the
[58:15] barnyard and scratched just like all the
[58:17] other little chickens did and and they
[58:19] tried to be a good chicken but it just
[58:22] couldn't make it as a chicken you know I
[58:25] tried to be a factory worker one time
[58:27] and that didn't work out very well they
[58:29] just couldn't ever find a place to put
[58:31] me where it worked real well I just you
[58:33] know my mind wanders I'm just not a good
[58:35] factory worker but I've done it and I
[58:37] would do it to support my family but
[58:38] it's just how it was hard on me and it
[58:41] just never seemed to fit and you just
[58:44] can't make an ego fit a chicken's
[58:46] lifestyle it just it's just always
[58:49] uncomfortable scratching in the dirt
[58:50] always uncomfortable eating the bugs he
[58:54] was made for something different and so
[58:58] he was an eagle but he thought he was a
[59:02] chicken and brother man makes a
[59:04] statement but just telling him his an
[59:07] eagle he's an eagle it's not enough but
[59:10] the realm says no matter how many tried
[59:12] to tell him an eagle and I think this
[59:14] many times where we make mistakes with
[59:15] our children is and where I do is I try
[59:19] to tell them you're not a chicken you're
[59:20] an eagle you're an eagle you're an eagle
[59:21] but the the word has to tell them that
[59:25] the
[59:26] has to be a dynamics that comes down
[59:29] into their lives because me telling me
[59:31] you're an eagle that should be obvious
[59:32] the way we live you're an eagle you're
[59:33] not a chicken but it has to become
[59:36] obvious to them and sometimes and so
[59:40] many times we worry when our children
[59:41] get to a certain age and they begin to
[59:42] explore and go out and do things they
[59:44] shouldn't do but sometimes I think it
[59:46] for some people especially they have to
[59:49] come to that place because they have to
[59:50] realize that it doesn't suit them they
[59:53] have to come to the place like the like
[59:55] the lost son did that he said hey I
[59:58] don't I don't belong here in the Pigpen
[1:00:01] I don't belong here I'm a prodigal I I
[1:00:04] don't fit in with everybody else
[1:00:06] I don't like pig scraps and sometimes it
[1:00:11] takes time for him to realize that but
[1:00:13] we have a promise we believe that we'll
[1:00:16] have them now he's brother Brown said no
[1:00:19] matter how many tried to tell him I
[1:00:20] Eagle he didn't know what he go was yet
[1:00:23] he wasn't eagle he would not understand
[1:00:26] it until he saw something that reflected
[1:00:28] him or that he said he reflected I like
[1:00:32] that saw something that he reflected
[1:00:35] because we're reflections of Christ he
[1:00:38] was a reflection in his DNA of his
[1:00:41] mother oh my and so he saw her when he
[1:00:45] saw her than he knew and brother Brennan
[1:00:47] said when we've seen how the
[1:00:49] denomination not a PhD not a lld not a
[1:00:51] good neighbor but a son of God molded in
[1:00:55] the image of God with the dynamic power
[1:00:57] or mine don't you realize it's more than
[1:01:00] just hearing you're an eagle he said
[1:01:02] with the dynamic power of God to answer
[1:01:04] the request of this day so like I said
[1:01:08] if that engine is demanding a certain
[1:01:10] amount of power then we have the
[1:01:12] quickening life of the word that comes
[1:01:14] in to our age to give it just that much
[1:01:16] power that's how much it demands that so
[1:01:19] much we'll have listen it's a hard age
[1:01:21] to live especially right now I've
[1:01:25] watched people over the years and as
[1:01:27] wise as a pastor I work I worked there
[1:01:29] as just in ministry over the years I've
[1:01:32] worked to bring to get people in church
[1:01:35] and there's a reason for that because
[1:01:37] when people fall away from the church
[1:01:40] they fall away from God I mean in cases
[1:01:42] and I don't mean that they're lost but
[1:01:45] when people quit coming to church they
[1:01:47] quit living like they did and you see
[1:01:51] that and you've seen that over the years
[1:01:52] it happens not 99 times out of a hundred
[1:01:55] but a hundred times out of a hundred and
[1:01:58] brother Branham talks about in what
[1:01:59] house could you build me and he talks
[1:02:01] about how that he himself and his
[1:02:03] children he said we saw we said we got
[1:02:05] away from the things that we should have
[1:02:07] been doing and did things we shouldn't
[1:02:09] have been doing not because they weren't
[1:02:11] Christians but because they got away
[1:02:12] from the house of God and so it matters
[1:02:14] to be gathered together
[1:02:16] it matters to have an and during this
[1:02:18] time that it's hard for us to be
[1:02:21] together and yet the devil could take
[1:02:23] advantage of that but yet I believe that
[1:02:26] the spirit and the word today the power
[1:02:29] the resurrection power of Christ that we
[1:02:31] have today is able to keep us even
[1:02:33] during this time even when it seems like
[1:02:36] there's there's no fellowship even when
[1:02:39] it is hard and even when it seems like
[1:02:40] it would be easy to backslide the word
[1:02:42] is able to keep us because he gave us
[1:02:45] the dynamics we would need for this age
[1:02:47] and he knew there would be an epidemic
[1:02:50] he knew there would be a before we knew
[1:02:52] anything about it he knew what the body
[1:02:54] count would be he knew how contagious it
[1:02:56] would be he knew everything about it he
[1:02:58] knows more about it today than the
[1:03:00] doctors do and if they even get anything
[1:03:02] from it i brother david said if they're
[1:03:04] able to get it we can pray for that and
[1:03:06] we should pray for that they'll be able
[1:03:07] to find a vaccine or some kind of a cure
[1:03:10] for it but if they're able to do that
[1:03:12] it'll be because of inspiration from God
[1:03:14] because he already knows the molecular
[1:03:17] structure and everything about it do we
[1:03:20] believe that today but then if he knew
[1:03:22] that he knew the church wouldn't be able
[1:03:24] to gather together like we want to
[1:03:26] wouldn't be able to hug one another like
[1:03:28] we want to wouldn't be able to shake
[1:03:30] hands brother Joe like we want to but he
[1:03:32] prepared us for this hour and he give us
[1:03:35] enough dynamics in this hour to be able
[1:03:37] to meet the challenge of our day so
[1:03:40] brother Barrett says the Son of God
[1:03:41] molded in the image of God with the
[1:03:43] dynamic power of God to answer the
[1:03:45] requests of this day amen that's what we
[1:03:50] have he said that he's the same yes
[1:03:53] today today and forever he said there
[1:03:55] ain't no hen gonna hold you hey Ben Amen
[1:04:00] now he says here he said he hunts for
[1:04:03] his mama he's an eagle to begin with
[1:04:06] he recognizes this real eagle recognizes
[1:04:10] the call of God's Word why he's an eagle
[1:04:13] I know this is what I want to get to he
[1:04:15] said an eagle to an eagle the word
[1:04:18] before the foundation and the word to
[1:04:20] the word now you are the word in the
[1:04:22] sense that you are the thoughts of God
[1:04:24] and when I say you I'm speaking to the
[1:04:26] part of you that's eternal not to the
[1:04:29] flesh right because the flesh may die
[1:04:32] and then be decayed and be down here in
[1:04:35] the morgue but but yet there's something
[1:04:37] on the inside that's not there anymore
[1:04:39] it goes somewhere so there's a part of
[1:04:42] you that's the word you were in the
[1:04:44] thoughts of God he said the word before
[1:04:46] the foundation the words are the word
[1:04:48] the word predestinated - the word
[1:04:50] written for the hour oh I love that he
[1:04:54] said this Ben this earthly body is
[1:04:58] quickened and brought by the quickening
[1:05:00] spirit of God to obedience to the Word
[1:05:03] of God so when he wanted to know how he
[1:05:07] could get there with her and that's what
[1:05:10] I wanted to know for the joke when I saw
[1:05:13] an eagle when that when when my life
[1:05:15] began to be quickened to the message of
[1:05:17] the hour I was raised in a message but
[1:05:18] there had to come a time that the life
[1:05:20] that was in me became quickened and when
[1:05:23] it began to be quickened I saw her and I
[1:05:25] said I want to be like her the word I
[1:05:28] wanted to be like that eagle I wanted to
[1:05:30] be like that message not just to conform
[1:05:32] to the words of a book but to be have
[1:05:35] that living in me and so there's things
[1:05:38] that she did he wanted to be like that
[1:05:41] he wanted to learn how to fly he wanted
[1:05:44] to learn how to how to defeat his
[1:05:45] earthbound condition well mine every one
[1:05:48] of us are in that same stage as we go
[1:05:50] through life when we're awakened to the
[1:05:52] call of God we want to learn how to fly
[1:05:54] we want to learn how to be spiritual
[1:05:56] creatures and not be just bound to the
[1:05:58] world and it swims you wanted to know
[1:06:01] how he could get there with her he'd
[1:06:03] been taught that he couldn't do that
[1:06:06] he'd been taught he couldn't do that
[1:06:08] listen that's the thing that we have to
[1:06:11] be careful of because when you promote
[1:06:14] denominations over the word then the
[1:06:16] denominations teach we you can't ever
[1:06:18] get there so you just come and take the
[1:06:20] sacrament and then you know I'm just
[1:06:22] gonna preach here for a minute you come
[1:06:24] and take the sacrament and then you'll
[1:06:26] be okay the Catholics say if you come
[1:06:28] and stick out your tongue and take the
[1:06:30] wafer you'll be okay
[1:06:31] come and do the mass about to say if you
[1:06:33] come shake the preachers hand you'll be
[1:06:35] okay
[1:06:36] many cases around the message we say
[1:06:39] well if you listen to a tape or if you
[1:06:41] listen to a certain preacher you'll be
[1:06:43] okay
[1:06:43] but listen that's not going to save you
[1:06:46] that's not going to get you there and if
[1:06:49] we're not careful we teach the people
[1:06:50] that they can't do that we teach the
[1:06:53] people that's for the preacher that's
[1:06:54] for the Prophet that's for someone else
[1:06:55] but no it's for you it's for me that we
[1:06:58] can fly like that
[1:07:00] we'll have to to get out of here one of
[1:07:02] these days we've got to be able to fly
[1:07:05] we will never have the gifts with a
[1:07:06] random hat will never have the office
[1:07:08] from other random hat but we have to be
[1:07:10] able to fly we've got to be able to
[1:07:14] fight we've got to be able as I said to
[1:07:18] operate in this age you've got to be an
[1:07:20] eagle you can't just be in Hawks
[1:07:23] no Dalek says I could never do that a
[1:07:26] lion could even say I could never do
[1:07:28] that but if you ever get the quickening
[1:07:31] power of an eagle you can fly and it
[1:07:34] takes that quickening power the eagle to
[1:07:36] be able to fly an hour an hour he'd been
[1:07:40] taught he couldn't do that you can't get
[1:07:42] no higher than you can jump he's a
[1:07:44] chicken see any bad oh don't you see I
[1:07:47] want more than just jumping want more
[1:07:49] than just shouting I want to go beyond
[1:07:51] the heavenlies and yes I'll jump yes
[1:07:55] I'll shot but I'm going beyond that I'm
[1:07:56] going back to the beginning again he
[1:07:59] said he's a chicken but this Eagle said
[1:08:01] that's not so well look at the chickens
[1:08:04] no matter what the chickens are you're
[1:08:06] an eagle very bad oh if we could just
[1:08:09] realize that today we don't have
[1:08:12] denominational expectations no matter
[1:08:14] what the chickens are you're an eagle
[1:08:16] just start spreading those wings
[1:08:18] get a little exercise in then start
[1:08:20] moving up and he says this he says the
[1:08:24] word - the word and this is a
[1:08:27] continuation of that quote he said the
[1:08:28] words of the word the works that I do
[1:08:31] show you also hey man he that believeth
[1:08:36] on me the works that I do shall he also
[1:08:37] see because I live he lives also and
[1:08:40] it's the spirit that raised him from the
[1:08:42] dead dwells in you it quickens your
[1:08:44] mortal body and people misunderstand
[1:08:48] because they think well that means I'll
[1:08:50] be walking along the street casting out
[1:08:52] Devils and healing the sick that means
[1:08:55] you could do that but you're the body of
[1:08:58] Christ you're a part of the body of
[1:08:59] Christ and brother branham explained it
[1:09:02] this way that someone in the body speaks
[1:09:03] in tongues someone in the body has a
[1:09:05] gift of healing someone in the body has
[1:09:07] a gift of being able to minister and
[1:09:09] things like that but there you're a part
[1:09:11] of the body it may be the soul on the
[1:09:13] bottom of the feet but you're still part
[1:09:14] of the body although I have that place
[1:09:16] reserved for myself but if you want to
[1:09:18] be that that part of that - you'd be
[1:09:20] part of the foot - but you're still part
[1:09:21] of the body right so we find that we
[1:09:26] have to have something that'll help us
[1:09:29] to be able to make the word work though
[1:09:31] it may not be a show and it won't be
[1:09:35] because as we read last week that
[1:09:37] brother Branham was talking about how
[1:09:39] they were expecting some great worldwide
[1:09:40] revival he said that's to the Jews it
[1:09:43] won't come in that way to us it's
[1:09:45] already came to us and we have the word
[1:09:48] that we need but what do we need today
[1:09:50] to continue to grow in the word and to
[1:09:54] continue to receive the Spirit of God to
[1:09:57] be refreshed by the Spirit of God to
[1:09:59] actually fulfill the promise of our day
[1:10:01] now I want us to go to Ephesians chapter
[1:10:03] 2 Ephesians chapter 2 and verse 1 he
[1:10:09] says this he says and you hath he
[1:10:14] quickened just ponder that for a moment
[1:10:18] you have to quickened you could put it
[1:10:22] like this me happy quickened me have two
[1:10:26] guys bad English but me happy quickened
[1:10:28] he quickened
[1:10:31] you hath he quickened who were dead in
[1:10:35] trespasses and sins notice how Paul
[1:10:37] includes us all in that you were dead
[1:10:40] but he has made you alive so he puts it
[1:10:44] in the past tense not in the present in
[1:10:46] the future he says you are quickened or
[1:10:49] you are already quickened so if you're
[1:10:52] born again you've been made alive so he
[1:10:56] says wherein in time past ye walked
[1:10:58] according to the course of this world
[1:10:59] according to the Prince of the power of
[1:11:01] the air the spirit that now worketh in
[1:11:03] the children of disobedience among whom
[1:11:05] also we all had our lifestyle in times
[1:11:08] past our conversations manner of life in
[1:11:10] times past in the lusts of our flesh
[1:11:12] fulfilling the desires of the flesh and
[1:11:15] of the mind and we're by nature the
[1:11:17] children of Wrath even as others but I
[1:11:21] love this but God who is rich in mercy
[1:11:23] aren't you glad he was rich in mercy
[1:11:25] aren't you glad he is rich in mercy for
[1:11:28] his great love wherewith he loved us
[1:11:30] even when we were dead in sins hath
[1:11:33] quickened us together with Christ has
[1:11:38] made us alive together with Christ by
[1:11:41] grace you're saved and hath raised us up
[1:11:44] together and made us sit together in
[1:11:46] heavenly places in Christ Jesus that in
[1:11:49] the ages to come he might show the
[1:11:51] exceeding riches of His grace in his
[1:11:53] kindness toward us through Christ Jesus
[1:11:55] so you could say well how am i quickened
[1:12:01] and like I said it doesn't come from
[1:12:02] working your way through a set of steps
[1:12:05] and I know it's been taught before
[1:12:07] around the message that you've got to
[1:12:09] work your way all the way through the
[1:12:11] pyramid before you can receive the Holy
[1:12:12] Ghost don't find that in the scripture
[1:12:16] because as I said they receive the Holy
[1:12:18] Ghost even while the word was preached
[1:12:19] the Holy Ghost fell so it's not working
[1:12:23] your way through a pyramid and saying
[1:12:24] well I have faith and virtue and all
[1:12:26] these things now I can receive the Holy
[1:12:28] Ghost but it takes the Holy Ghost to
[1:12:30] even have those things in your life and
[1:12:32] then you have those things must increase
[1:12:35] in your life add to your faith virtue
[1:12:37] and all of those things but there's got
[1:12:40] to come a Holy Spirit indwelling that
[1:12:44] makes you
[1:12:45] actually be able to live those things
[1:12:47] and if that indwelling can't happen
[1:12:49] until after you're got your life all
[1:12:51] perfect then very few of us would ever
[1:12:55] have hope of ever growing in Christ but
[1:12:59] it's got to be by grace see we are
[1:13:03] justified by faith and it's the Holy
[1:13:07] Spirit that does the justification
[1:13:09] brother Branham puts it this way he said
[1:13:11] the spirit of the life I'm sorry I'll
[1:13:16] back up he said then how do we get into
[1:13:17] this body first Christmas well by one
[1:13:21] Spirit we were all baptized into this
[1:13:23] body he said by one Holy Spirit baptism
[1:13:26] he said his first Corinthians 12:13 he
[1:13:30] said by one Spirit we were all baptized
[1:13:32] and the Spirit is the life of Christ he
[1:13:35] said the life of Christ and the life of
[1:13:37] any seed which he was the word seed
[1:13:40] brings the seed to life that's pretty
[1:13:43] simple the life of any seed brings the
[1:13:47] seed to life oh my said you get it if
[1:13:51] that life is laying in the seed and this
[1:13:54] baptism of the Holy Spirit come upon it
[1:13:56] it is bound to bring the seed that seed
[1:14:00] life he says so he's saying that the
[1:14:05] life is already in the seed but when the
[1:14:08] Holy Spirit falls on it it brings it to
[1:14:10] life now how does the quickening power
[1:14:14] how does that take place looks by faith
[1:14:17] by faith
[1:14:18] Romans 5:1 therefore being justified by
[1:14:20] faith now we don't just have faith and
[1:14:23] receive the Holy Ghost
[1:14:24] no but he indwells us after we've had
[1:14:27] faith does that make sense you have
[1:14:30] faith justified by faith we have peace
[1:14:32] with God now say where does the faith
[1:14:34] come from well you can't have faith
[1:14:37] yourself for anything the faith has to
[1:14:40] come from somewhere but one day you
[1:14:42] believed in spite of yourself you
[1:14:46] believed where is the capacity for faith
[1:14:49] there's some people who just can't
[1:14:50] believe but for for us there's something
[1:14:53] inside of you that just has the capacity
[1:14:55] to believe oh by
[1:14:58] what makes you believe faith and what
[1:15:02] makes you have that faith oh my it's
[1:15:06] already in there the word comes to the
[1:15:09] work now Romans 5:2 by whom also we have
[1:15:12] access by faith into this grace when we
[1:15:15] stand where does the faith come from we
[1:15:18] find it's the faith of him and
[1:15:20] efficients 3:12 and whom we have
[1:15:21] boldness and access with confidence by
[1:15:24] the faith of him
[1:15:25] now watch the faith is in the seat but
[1:15:29] the faith is made alive by hearing the
[1:15:30] word where does the faith come from it
[1:15:33] comes by hearing Romans 10:17 then faith
[1:15:36] cometh by hearing and hearing by the
[1:15:38] Word of God we could say it like this
[1:15:39] your faith is awakened and increased by
[1:15:42] hearing the faith of God in you I'm keep
[1:15:47] backing up and rephrasing myself but the
[1:15:49] faith of God in you actually causes you
[1:15:53] to begin to manifest the works of God
[1:15:56] the faith of God in you is awakened by
[1:15:59] hearing the Word of God but the Branham
[1:16:02] says it this way God lives in his word
[1:16:05] so we don't serve a dead God the message
[1:16:08] of the hour is not dead letter and when
[1:16:11] people say well the word is just dead
[1:16:13] it's not dead it's not dead it's life
[1:16:16] because the life comes and dwells in the
[1:16:19] word oh my so he says he says God lives
[1:16:25] in his word faith cometh by hearing
[1:16:26] hearing the word by faith you're safe
[1:16:28] through grace not by anything whether
[1:16:30] you shake or speak with tongues whatever
[1:16:32] takes place that has nothing to do into
[1:16:34] it at all jesus said he that heareth my
[1:16:37] words and believe it's on him that sent
[1:16:38] me hath eternal life he that hears my
[1:16:41] word some believe it's been made
[1:16:43] quickened to him hath eternal life there
[1:16:45] it is doesn't matter he said what little
[1:16:47] thing that you do if you go back and
[1:16:49] look at that in Hebrews chapter five and
[1:16:50] six he talks about how that the people
[1:16:53] were putting all their faith in shaking
[1:16:55] or running the aisles or something like
[1:16:57] that speaking in tongues he said but it
[1:16:59] doesn't matter what little thing that
[1:17:00] you do don't those are the effects of
[1:17:02] his presence but what is it it's the
[1:17:03] faith that you have if you hear the
[1:17:06] words of God and there's the ability
[1:17:08] there somehow you understand it hey men
[1:17:11] what is that it's the grace of God to
[1:17:14] you and sometimes we begin to look for
[1:17:19] something else when what we have is what
[1:17:22] God give us grace to half now look the
[1:17:27] word of this hours and dwelt with the
[1:17:28] spirit the same as he was Matthew 3:16
[1:17:31] I'm closing in a few moments just bear
[1:17:35] with me Matthew 3:16 people will ask you
[1:17:40] is it hard to preach to a lot of people
[1:17:42] to a big crowd and that's not true it's
[1:17:44] actually hard to preach to a small crowd
[1:17:47] because you feel like you're yelling at
[1:17:49] everybody so I apologize for that but I
[1:17:52] know there's others watching and I trust
[1:17:54] that the entire church is able to see
[1:17:57] this this morning and you know that's
[1:17:59] that's just part of it and in and I
[1:18:02] don't want to I'm self aware this
[1:18:04] morning more than I should be but I
[1:18:05] don't want to I don't want to make it
[1:18:07] too personal to you
[1:18:08] but I think that we do need to take the
[1:18:10] Word of God personally if the shoe fits
[1:18:12] wear it just don't put on anything
[1:18:14] that's not yours so the word of the hour
[1:18:16] is indwelt by the spirit Matthew 3:16
[1:18:18] Jesus when he was baptized went up
[1:18:20] straightway out of the water and lo the
[1:18:22] heavens were opened unto him and he saw
[1:18:24] the Spirit of God descending like a dove
[1:18:25] and lighting upon him and lo a voice
[1:18:28] from heaven saying this is my beloved
[1:18:30] Son in whom I'm well pleased and brother
[1:18:33] branham always adds the verbage he said
[1:18:35] would come from the original I'm pleased
[1:18:37] to dwell in I'm pleased to dwell in it
[1:18:40] was the indwelling of the Holy Spirit
[1:18:42] which could not come even to John but
[1:18:46] had to come to the word it could not
[1:18:49] come to anything else but he was the
[1:18:51] word right
[1:18:53] he was the word he was the Incarnate God
[1:18:56] he was incarnate brother Branham said
[1:18:58] that seed that came was Jehovah that
[1:19:01] first seed that was in Mary was not Mary
[1:19:04] and it was not human it was it was God
[1:19:08] made in human form he was incarnate God
[1:19:12] but yet the indwelling of the Spirit
[1:19:14] come down and in dwelt the word what
[1:19:18] does the Holy Spirit come down on he
[1:19:21] comes down on the word that's what he's
[1:19:24] indwelling and so if you think
[1:19:25] I just don't live a good-enough life I'm
[1:19:27] just not good enough no you can receive
[1:19:29] the Holy Spirit if you come God's
[1:19:31] provided way and how you receive that is
[1:19:34] you let him and dwell the word in your
[1:19:36] life he's not indwelling your flesh
[1:19:39] because if he was we because it'd be
[1:19:42] costly have belief right and we can
[1:19:45] grieve him but we're not grieving him
[1:19:47] from the work what are we grieving him
[1:19:49] from the effects on our flesh right we
[1:19:53] can't feel him anymore we lose the joy
[1:19:56] of our salvation but we don't lose him
[1:19:58] why because he doesn't end well the by
[1:20:00] the flesh hope you're with me this
[1:20:03] morning he indwells the word and when
[1:20:07] the dynamics and the mechanics come
[1:20:09] together in your life you may even
[1:20:11] backside but you'll come back why
[1:20:14] because he's indwelling the word hey Ben
[1:20:18] oh my huh but the brown says the Dove
[1:20:26] which was God and this is improving his
[1:20:27] word he said descending from heaven with
[1:20:30] a voice saying this is my beloved son
[1:20:31] and whom I'm pleased to dwell what did
[1:20:34] he come to do to redeem that part of the
[1:20:36] earth he was the beginning of the
[1:20:38] creation of God what does the Holy
[1:20:39] Spirit come into the word for to redeem
[1:20:42] oh my oh my because he again you could
[1:20:47] you could do things that were wrong and
[1:20:49] you would you would grieve him but he
[1:20:51] would still be in the in the word but
[1:20:53] what does he want to do he wants to
[1:20:55] redeem you he wants to redeem you he
[1:20:59] wants to bring you back and we know that
[1:21:01] this flesh is never fully redeemed until
[1:21:04] we get a change right but yet he wants
[1:21:08] to redeem the earth oh my look so it's
[1:21:13] not that you'll get the Holy Ghost they
[1:21:14] just go live any way you want to but
[1:21:16] that was that Holy Spirit that in dwells
[1:21:18] the word comes to redeem the body are
[1:21:22] you with me now now what did he come to
[1:21:25] do were to redeem that part of the earth
[1:21:26] he was the beginning of the creation of
[1:21:27] God because God is not a creation only
[1:21:30] in Christ he is a creation because God
[1:21:32] is eternal and a spirit a spirit is not
[1:21:35] created he was the beginning of the
[1:21:37] creation of God
[1:21:38] and God redeemed that body see when he
[1:21:41] come down this is my beloved son I'm
[1:21:42] well pleased in him so he said God
[1:21:46] coming down after going through this and
[1:21:48] now every son he said that you eat and
[1:21:52] born of a natural sexual birth the way
[1:21:54] you come when it comes to a place where
[1:21:57] you go through water baptism then Holy
[1:21:58] Ghost baptism then the Holy Ghost comes
[1:22:00] down with the fire baptism and claims
[1:22:02] this creation the same as it did him oh
[1:22:04] my the Holy Ghost in God is the same
[1:22:08] spirit and so he comes in and dwells the
[1:22:10] word so that he can increase until he
[1:22:13] can claim the entire being
[1:22:15] oh my because he's gonna have all of you
[1:22:21] amen
[1:22:22] and so it comes down and claims he said
[1:22:25] the Holy Ghost from God is the same
[1:22:26] spirit so it comes down and claims this
[1:22:28] body for the resurrection and he was
[1:22:30] raised for our justification all the
[1:22:33] father has given me will come not one
[1:22:34] will be lost I'll raise it up at the
[1:22:36] last day not one hair of his head will
[1:22:38] even Paris he said that is the beginning
[1:22:40] of the creation of God speaking of
[1:22:42] Christ he said this is a continuation of
[1:22:45] the creation of God
[1:22:47] oh my so now look and I hope I haven't
[1:22:53] confused you so far but I've done it to
[1:22:54] make a point
[1:22:55] haven't confused you to make a point but
[1:22:57] I've said these things to make a point
[1:22:59] when we come to Christ everything that
[1:23:03] we have need of is within us to be born
[1:23:09] again to have the resurrection but we've
[1:23:13] got to grow into it and if the word is
[1:23:17] there to be quickened then he will quick
[1:23:20] in that life until he is able to end
[1:23:22] well it and when he indwells that word
[1:23:25] he will then quicken you and he doesn't
[1:23:28] stop until you get there now with
[1:23:35] visions 4:11 tells us the speaks of the
[1:23:38] fullness and I'm gonna skip down I'm
[1:23:39] sorry for doing this but I'm it's hard
[1:23:41] for when I skip around for the people on
[1:23:43] the on the slides but I'm gonna skip
[1:23:46] down to verse 14 because
[1:23:51] we we understand the first part of that
[1:23:53] to give some apostles and prophets and
[1:23:54] so forth
[1:23:55] he said that we henceforth be no more
[1:23:57] children tossed to and fro so there's a
[1:23:59] purpose for the ministry there's a
[1:24:01] purpose for hearing the word and
[1:24:02] remember faith comes by hearing of the
[1:24:04] word so there's there's a seed there
[1:24:06] there's faith there but yet that faith
[1:24:09] has to be awakened you see fully explain
[1:24:11] that I can't but you already have the
[1:24:15] faith you need yet your faith comes by
[1:24:18] hearing the word somehow it awakens that
[1:24:21] it increases that when we come to Christ
[1:24:23] we have all these things but we don't
[1:24:25] want to be when we come we're children
[1:24:27] we don't want to be children so we want
[1:24:30] to grow up into the stature of a perfect
[1:24:31] man so he said carried not carried about
[1:24:33] with every wind of doctrine by the
[1:24:34] sleight of men and cunning craftiness
[1:24:35] whereby they lie in wait to deceive but
[1:24:38] speaking the truth in love may grow up
[1:24:40] into him in all things which is the head
[1:24:44] in even Christ from whom the whole body
[1:24:47] fitly joined together and compacted by
[1:24:50] that which every joint supplieth
[1:24:51] according to the effectual working in
[1:24:53] the measure of every part maketh
[1:24:55] increase of the body unto the edifying
[1:24:57] of itself in love now but the Branham
[1:25:02] explains that he said when you see that
[1:25:04] little plant about like that just out of
[1:25:06] an apple seed he said have set it out
[1:25:08] there in every apple that will ever be
[1:25:10] on there it's got in it then potentially
[1:25:13] hundreds of bushels of apples that
[1:25:16] you'll collect off of it and it ain't a
[1:25:20] half inch high he said there you are
[1:25:22] where does it come from it's in the
[1:25:24] Apple then so it's impossible for you
[1:25:29] not to overcome and what that does for
[1:25:33] us does not make us we're okay I'll
[1:25:35] overcome regardless what I do know it
[1:25:37] makes you without excuse makes me
[1:25:39] without excuse all right if I don't
[1:25:43] overcome with the word that I have
[1:25:45] there's something wrong and it's not
[1:25:46] something wrong with the word because
[1:25:49] you will overcome and like I said you
[1:25:51] may fall everything else but in the end
[1:25:52] you will overcome we judge things by
[1:25:55] pictures on Facebook and we judge things
[1:25:57] by moments and time and tweets and we
[1:26:00] judge things by whether somebody comes
[1:26:02] to church now or not but
[1:26:04] yeah if you look at in the entirety of
[1:26:06] life an overcomer overcomes somewhere in
[1:26:10] that life they're gonna overcome by the
[1:26:12] Danny there's got to be something in
[1:26:14] them that overcomes it may not happen
[1:26:16] all it wants maybe for years they were a
[1:26:18] drunk or maybe for years they were doing
[1:26:20] things they shouldn't but there comes a
[1:26:21] time they will overcome and I want to
[1:26:24] tell you this morning you will overcome
[1:26:25] you say well if I could just shout if I
[1:26:27] could just speak in tongues so
[1:26:28] everything you have need of is inside
[1:26:30] that apple seed but you've got to get to
[1:26:34] the place where you just surrender to
[1:26:36] that and it begins to grow in your life
[1:26:38] let it grow in your life it has it
[1:26:40] includes shouting coming to an altar
[1:26:42] letting hands be laid on you whatever it
[1:26:44] is but let it grow
[1:26:48] you said you set the little plan out
[1:26:50] every Apple to deliver beyond there
[1:26:52] Scotty in it then hundreds of bushels of
[1:26:55] apples that you collect off of it and
[1:26:56] sometimes we can't see inside the seed
[1:26:58] and so that little seeds got things in
[1:27:01] it got potential in it right and that
[1:27:03] little seeds got a deacon in it
[1:27:04] somewhere but you don't see that Deacon
[1:27:07] when he's running around cruising you
[1:27:09] know down the streets as a teenager you
[1:27:12] don't see that preacher when it's a
[1:27:13] young person acted up in the church
[1:27:15] right you don't see the potential of
[1:27:19] what that seed is you don't see that
[1:27:21] resurrected son of God when they're
[1:27:23] smoking dope they're doing drugs you
[1:27:26] can't see that but it doesn't mean it's
[1:27:29] not bad oh my and it goes to the power
[1:27:35] of the preached word because I can
[1:27:37] preach and there's nothing I can do to
[1:27:39] make you more of a Christian there's
[1:27:41] nothing I can do to make you grow
[1:27:43] there's nothing I can do but preach the
[1:27:44] word and when I preach the word or
[1:27:47] someone else comes behind this pulpit
[1:27:49] and preach the sword what does it do it
[1:27:50] causes you to hear the word that's
[1:27:52] pretty simple isn't it when you hear the
[1:27:54] word what happens first weren't there
[1:27:57] it'll respond to the word it will
[1:28:00] respond to the word and as it responds
[1:28:02] it grows and pretty soon we see that
[1:28:04] deacon coming out we see that preacher
[1:28:06] that song leader coming down we see
[1:28:07] something coming and everybody has known
[1:28:09] you all your life we'll look at that and
[1:28:10] say there's no way he could do that but
[1:28:12] God saw it in the beginning God saw the
[1:28:15] entirety of the life he knew exactly
[1:28:16] what he wanted him
[1:28:18] you know exactly what he wanted you to
[1:28:19] go through so he sees inside of that
[1:28:21] seat everything that it will be we can't
[1:28:24] see that but we have to have faith to
[1:28:25] believe and so I don't believe people
[1:28:27] are serpent seed when I preach to him
[1:28:29] what good does it do to believe that
[1:28:31] what good is to do sit there and say
[1:28:33] well there's three kinds of believers so
[1:28:35] we try to figure out who they are
[1:28:37] doesn't do any good why because when I
[1:28:40] do that all I do is limit what God can
[1:28:42] do I don't know but some of you may not
[1:28:45] make it and I pray that every one of you
[1:28:47] does some of you may not but there may
[1:28:48] be somebody that we haven't even heard
[1:28:49] of yet that'll be the last seed that
[1:28:52] comes in it may be somebody that's on
[1:28:54] the worst kind of you look at today may
[1:28:56] be the worst saying that people around
[1:28:57] here do this mess and you see a
[1:28:59] meth-head walk around with their teeth
[1:29:01] falling out and everything like that and
[1:29:02] you think how could that ever be the Son
[1:29:04] of God tattoos all over them let me tell
[1:29:06] you God can save them as much as he
[1:29:08] saved you then what is our
[1:29:10] responsibility to to call it to make
[1:29:12] that explosion happen and how can we do
[1:29:14] that we can't make it happen just by
[1:29:16] preaching the word oh my so we keep the
[1:29:21] church open so the word can be preached
[1:29:22] and the people can hear it and we can
[1:29:24] all grow into what that seed ought to be
[1:29:28] hey Ben where does it come from he said
[1:29:32] it's in the Apple then he said and when
[1:29:35] you're planted into his death burial and
[1:29:37] resurrection planted in Christ and
[1:29:39] receive His Holy Spirit life in you
[1:29:42] everything that you've got need of all
[1:29:45] the way through this journey is in you
[1:29:46] right then for you become the seed God
[1:29:50] in his word
[1:29:52] he said now what does a tree have to do
[1:29:55] this is in show us the father and it was
[1:29:57] suffice as he said when you plant it the
[1:30:00] only thing you have to do is water it
[1:30:02] and then it's got to drink the leaves
[1:30:05] are in it the apples are in and
[1:30:07] everything is right in the tree but it's
[1:30:09] got to drink and this is my prayer today
[1:30:12] said it's got to drink more than its
[1:30:15] portion more than its portion now I look
[1:30:20] at that for a moment go back again to
[1:30:22] the prayer of Jabez and jay-bez praises
[1:30:24] to the Lord and large my territory he's
[1:30:26] not saying he wanted what somebody else
[1:30:27] is supposed to have but he said Lord I
[1:30:30] want to make sure
[1:30:31] that my portion is sufficient enlarge my
[1:30:34] territory so he says you drink it drinks
[1:30:36] more than its portion when I pray I say
[1:30:38] God help me to drink more than my
[1:30:40] portion help me to drink more than what
[1:30:43] I need just to preach to you I need to
[1:30:45] drink something that'll caused me to
[1:30:47] grow you see why I'm minister has to say
[1:30:50] in the word because you've got to drink
[1:30:52] more than your portion Oman don't you
[1:30:55] see why I Christian has to stay in the
[1:30:57] word but Harvey because you've got to
[1:30:58] drink more than your portion you can
[1:31:00] drink you could get by with just reading
[1:31:03] scriptures once in a while you can get
[1:31:06] by with just reading the quote now and
[1:31:08] then but you drink more than your
[1:31:10] portion because you don't want to just
[1:31:11] get by you want to grow and as it drinks
[1:31:15] it push this out and push this out
[1:31:17] leaves it pushes out blossoms and you've
[1:31:19] seen that and I've seen it all the
[1:31:21] sudden as it grows as it begins to drink
[1:31:23] in the word as you see even children
[1:31:25] young people they begin to drink in the
[1:31:26] word it begins to push out blossoms you
[1:31:28] begin to see peace in their life and joy
[1:31:30] and long-suffering you begin to see the
[1:31:32] qualities of a Christian the fruits of
[1:31:34] the Spirit in their life you begin to
[1:31:36] see maybe somebody begin to do things
[1:31:38] around the church they didn't used to do
[1:31:39] begin to be a help instead of just dead
[1:31:41] weight dragging around why because it's
[1:31:43] drinking more than its portion when you
[1:31:45] see a Christian that is just dead weight
[1:31:47] and continues to be dead weight year
[1:31:49] after year after year and I'm not
[1:31:50] talking about someone who's physically
[1:31:52] unable to do I'm talking about somebody
[1:31:54] that just constant drag criticizing and
[1:31:57] carrying on all the time if they're just
[1:31:59] dead weight year after year after year
[1:32:00] what's happening they're just not
[1:32:02] drinking enough they're just not feeding
[1:32:05] on the word enough because if they would
[1:32:06] just feed on that Living Word if they
[1:32:08] would just drink more than their portion
[1:32:10] they would begin to boss them out push
[1:32:12] out apples he said but it's got to keep
[1:32:14] drinking drinking drinking in order to
[1:32:16] push out when we take a promise of God
[1:32:18] drop it into our heart we keep watering
[1:32:20] it with faith and it keeps pushing out
[1:32:22] pushing out hallelujah
[1:32:24] he said when Christ is planted in our
[1:32:27] heart the Holy Ghost the only thing we
[1:32:29] do is drink the Word of God well you say
[1:32:35] well I need a certain amount of emotion
[1:32:38] I need to certain own the only thing you
[1:32:40] do is drink the Word of God it'll come
[1:32:42] in a motion at times it'll come in
[1:32:44] different ways
[1:32:44] effect as God has ways of putting making
[1:32:47] the atmosphere to be right around us oh
[1:32:49] we need to do is strength the Word of
[1:32:51] God it pushes out salvation it pushes
[1:32:54] out divine healing it pushes out glory
[1:32:55] it pushes out everything that we have
[1:32:58] needeth is right in us when we're
[1:33:00] planted in Christ Jesus you see the Holy
[1:33:04] Ghost inefficient 1:14 is the earnest or
[1:33:07] the seal of the Holy Ghost is the
[1:33:08] earnest of our inheritance until the
[1:33:11] redemption of the purchased possession
[1:33:13] so he's given us our guarantee and we
[1:33:17] want to look at that some more in just a
[1:33:19] moment but then next next week
[1:33:20] especially the Lord willing if we're
[1:33:23] still here and we want to make sure I
[1:33:25] believe we'll still be here unless the
[1:33:27] Lord comes but he may come in the next
[1:33:29] week and so we want to we want to look
[1:33:34] at the earnest in the in the guarantee
[1:33:37] of it but he said the person of Christ
[1:33:39] or it says it's the earnest of our
[1:33:41] inheritance that's the person of Christ
[1:33:43] and dwelling in you and that gives you
[1:33:45] the potentials of full redemption no
[1:33:48] brother Brent says I'm just gonna read
[1:33:49] this for lack of time he said quickly
[1:33:53] he said now notice he said it's the
[1:33:54] earnest or the potential the quickening
[1:33:57] power of your resurrection the
[1:33:58] quickening power of your resurrection
[1:34:00] when you receive the holy spirit as vend
[1:34:02] welling in you the potential of it
[1:34:05] notice you are now on your way when do
[1:34:09] you get started on your way when you
[1:34:12] receive Christ when you believe in
[1:34:15] Christ that's when you get started on
[1:34:17] your way you say well those people are
[1:34:20] you know just starting they're just not
[1:34:22] like me you're still started on your way
[1:34:23] you're still continuing on your way all
[1:34:27] right well I have the Holy Ghost that
[1:34:29] doesn't mean you stop that means you
[1:34:30] started it means you accelerated right
[1:34:34] so notice he said you're on your way now
[1:34:36] growing to the full resurrection no tree
[1:34:38] comes up overnight it's got to grow as
[1:34:40] we grow in the grace of knowledge of God
[1:34:42] you are baptized into the Holy Spirit he
[1:34:45] said now it's the Pentecostal church
[1:34:46] baptized into the Holy Spirit it's begin
[1:34:49] growing limbs has died
[1:34:51] they was pruning them off but the trees
[1:34:54] took growing is still going on because
[1:34:56] it's got to come to the rest
[1:34:58] should he said they're led by the spirit
[1:35:00] to quicken the word to you who is
[1:35:02] believers the word keeps quickening as
[1:35:05] you come he said to the first limb the
[1:35:08] second limb the 3rd limb on up
[1:35:09] it just keeps quickening the Spirit of
[1:35:12] God keeps quickening to you
[1:35:14] he said notice that Pentecost their
[1:35:16] bodies were quickened by the new life
[1:35:18] they received he said that makes me feel
[1:35:20] religious now here was a man fishermen
[1:35:22] tax collectors humble little women
[1:35:24] ordinary housewives little virgin girls
[1:35:26] they were believers they were believing
[1:35:29] that this was the truth do we believe
[1:35:31] that today they believe that when Jesus
[1:35:33] died they believed on him and rose up
[1:35:35] again from the dead they believe that to
[1:35:37] be the absolute testimony of God that he
[1:35:39] had quickened them to life quickened him
[1:35:42] to life now they go up to the day of
[1:35:45] Pentecost
[1:35:46] he says to receive their abstract and
[1:35:51] then he begins to explain to abstraction
[1:35:53] we want to go there maybe next week but
[1:35:55] but look the indwelling of the Holy
[1:35:58] Ghost is our abstract and when brother
[1:36:00] Brian was talking about it and I want to
[1:36:01] get this before we go brother Adam is
[1:36:04] talking about an abstract he's not
[1:36:06] talking about the beginning of the
[1:36:07] search now I did title insurance for 15
[1:36:11] years many times I've been handed
[1:36:13] abstracts and when I first came in they
[1:36:16] still did some abstracts and back in the
[1:36:18] day and some of you elderly folks so
[1:36:21] anybody that's been around buying houses
[1:36:23] for more than about 30 years knows what
[1:36:25] an abstract is and anymore we do title
[1:36:28] insurance well an abstract is a document
[1:36:32] right that that it has a list of all of
[1:36:36] the deeds in it and it shows through
[1:36:39] seeing your name well think about it
[1:36:42] when do you receive an abstract but the
[1:36:44] browser said they went up there to
[1:36:46] receive an abstract you don't receive an
[1:36:49] abstract when you make the handshake and
[1:36:51] so that's the parts if you show that
[1:36:53] side that's the parts of the closing
[1:36:55] process is when the contract is the
[1:36:57] handshake agreement or the written
[1:36:59] agreement that you make that says I'm
[1:37:00] gonna buy this but the contracts already
[1:37:03] made at this point right and then the
[1:37:06] closing is actually when you make the
[1:37:08] payment you you bring money or
[1:37:11] the bank brings money somebody brings
[1:37:13] money to the table you sit down at the
[1:37:14] table you sign all the documents and
[1:37:16] it's yours and brother branham calls out
[1:37:18] getting the title getting the title
[1:37:21] that's when you get the title and they
[1:37:24] take it in an escrow door whatever but
[1:37:26] there comes a time when you receive the
[1:37:28] abstract and what that means is or what
[1:37:32] I meant to brother branham in that day
[1:37:33] would have been actually getting it from
[1:37:36] the abstract office you would have went
[1:37:38] up there knocked on the door because it
[1:37:39] was too big to mail in many cases and
[1:37:42] now we mailed policies out but they
[1:37:45] would have the abstract and your
[1:37:46] original deed and they would have it
[1:37:49] together because during this time
[1:37:51] they've been paying off all of the lumps
[1:37:53] they've been curing all of the liens
[1:37:56] right that's what we did we pay off all
[1:37:59] the loans we investigate all the leads
[1:38:01] and we make sure there's nothing against
[1:38:04] the property and then we type up the
[1:38:06] abstract to renew it from
[1:38:29] the thing is when these mics go off we
[1:38:31] could say whatever we wanted to and
[1:38:33] those out there couldn't hear it but we
[1:38:34] won't do that but the abstract is when
[1:38:39] you get it back does that make sense
[1:38:41] you've gotten it back when you get it
[1:38:44] back whether it's mailed to you you went
[1:38:46] up to the office knocked on the door
[1:38:47] said I want my abstract it's time and
[1:38:50] what they did is waited for the return
[1:38:53] of the abstract during this time he's
[1:38:55] leading captivity captivity he's gone
[1:38:57] down preach the souls in hell all these
[1:38:59] things have taken place for their
[1:39:00] Redemption and he made the payment and
[1:39:03] they came on the day of Pentecost and
[1:39:05] waited until the abstract came back and
[1:39:09] it was no longer in the name of Jehovah
[1:39:11] it was no longer with a mortgage under
[1:39:14] Satan's law or under Satan's hold but
[1:39:18] now it would come out the other side
[1:39:20] paid for and redeemed it belonged to
[1:39:23] them by what is the abstract what is the
[1:39:28] Holy Ghost it is the guarantee the
[1:39:31] document or the proof that says it's in
[1:39:33] my name this belongs to me I wasn't
[1:39:38] there at the closing I didn't make the
[1:39:39] payment I couldn't I couldn't even make
[1:39:42] the cousin it I couldn't even make the
[1:39:44] agreement but the abstract a man is in
[1:39:47] me the abstract has shown me that it's
[1:39:50] mine it belongs to me listen what it did
[1:39:55] but the Brennan said let take a look at
[1:39:56] the faithful once at Pentecost they were
[1:39:57] all in the upper room and they were all
[1:39:59] scared and I know some of you may be
[1:40:02] scared this morning you may be scared
[1:40:04] and maybe maybe not just because of the
[1:40:06] coronavirus but there may be fear that
[1:40:08] puts on us it put gets put on us in all
[1:40:11] kinds of ways fear gets put on us so we
[1:40:13] believe that what we're just not gonna
[1:40:15] make you we're not good enough
[1:40:16] Christians but he said they were that
[1:40:17] way they were all scared they had the
[1:40:20] title all right but they were afraid and
[1:40:22] all at once there came a sound from
[1:40:24] heaven the abstract sit down to them
[1:40:26] like a rushing mighty wind and filled
[1:40:29] all the house where they were sitting
[1:40:30] and they were so quickened by that till
[1:40:33] all their cowardliness he said one of
[1:40:36] them was afraid that even deny he wasn't
[1:40:38] a Pharisee yet he wasn't a Sadducee yet
[1:40:40] maybe there's somebody listening like
[1:40:42] that
[1:40:42] maybe afraid to identify themselves with
[1:40:44] the message of the hour afraid to say
[1:40:47] I'm not a Baptist I'm not a Methodist
[1:40:48] I'm a believer he was afraid to deny
[1:40:50] that he wasn't a Pharisee yet it wasn't
[1:40:52] a sad to see but when that Holy Ghost
[1:40:53] fell and baptized him into Jesus Christ
[1:40:56] he became flesh of his flesh bone of his
[1:40:59] bone word of his word he was a new
[1:41:01] creation he was a new person it
[1:41:03] quickened his body aren't you glad today
[1:41:05] we're not just going to the closing
[1:41:06] process listen and that's why you don't
[1:41:09] have to wait on the Holy Ghost you don't
[1:41:11] have to sit around and Jerry and wait
[1:41:12] and stay in an altar for hours and hours
[1:41:14] no you just received the Holy Ghost why
[1:41:16] the payments already been made the
[1:41:19] abstracts already been prepared it's in
[1:41:21] your name it's time to receive it this
