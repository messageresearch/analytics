[41:37] [Music]
[41:39] turn with me to James chapter one we'll
[41:41] start reading in verse 19 and read down
[41:43] through verse 25 James 1 19.
[41:49] then we have good Services last weekend
[41:51] I know some of y'all are just recovering
[41:54] but I've had so many good testimonies of
[41:57] of the meetings and how brought people
[42:00] closer to the Lord and and people closer
[42:03] to each other and fellowship and so
[42:06] grateful for that and but we just
[42:08] believe the Lord is going to continue to
[42:10] work
[42:11] let's make this morning another time
[42:13] when we can be brought closer to the
[42:15] Lord and and he can just work in our
[42:17] lives we believe he can do that today
[42:19] amen where two or three are gathered
[42:21] together he said I yeah
[42:24] I will be in the midst amen I believe
[42:27] that he's here this morning and if he's
[42:29] here anything is possible he's able to
[42:32] meet our needs amen James chapter 1 and
[42:35] verse 19 he said wherefore my beloved
[42:38] Brethren let every man be swift to hear
[42:41] slow to speak slow to Wrath
[42:44] for the wrath of man worketh not the
[42:47] righteousness of God
[42:49] wherefore lay apart all filthiness and
[42:52] superfluity of naughtiness and receive
[42:55] with meekness the engrafted word it's
[42:58] just able to save your souls
[43:00] but be doers of the word and not hearers
[43:03] only deceiving your own selves
[43:06] for if any be a hearer of the word and
[43:09] not a doer
[43:11] he is likened to a man beholding his
[43:14] natural face in a glass
[43:16] for he beholdth himself and goeth his
[43:19] way and straightway forgetth what manner
[43:22] of man he was
[43:24] but whoso looketh into the perfect law
[43:26] of Liberty and continueth therein he
[43:30] being not a forgetful hearer but a doer
[43:32] of the work this man shall be blessed in
[43:36] his deed I pray the Lord without his
[43:38] Blessing to the word you may be seated
[43:40] this morning
[43:43] I'd like to
[43:45] preach this morning if I would title the
[43:48] message it would be identifying your
[43:51] present character in the mirror of God's
[43:53] word
[43:54] I I heard a story about a missionary who
[43:58] had a mirror and he he took his this
[44:01] mirror and he was using it to shave with
[44:03] he was in a a tropical island somewhere
[44:06] and and he used this mirror hung on a
[44:09] tree to shave and uh the people there
[44:12] the natives they'd never seen a mirror
[44:14] and one day a witch doctor a female
[44:17] witch doctor came by the camp where he
[44:20] was and and she saw that mirror and she
[44:23] said I want to buy that off of you I
[44:25] want to trade for that and she let him
[44:27] know I want that mirror and and he said
[44:29] well I I don't want to give that up
[44:31] that's what I used to shave with but she
[44:33] kind of pressed him a little bit let him
[44:35] know that it'd be good for his health if
[44:37] she got that mirror and and so he gave
[44:40] it to her and she takes that mirror and
[44:43] brother Bill she she grabbed it grabbed
[44:45] it off of the tree she takes it and just
[44:46] just smashes it on the ground
[44:49] and what had happened is she'd seen
[44:51] herself in the mirror and she was all
[44:54] painted up and and pierced and and like
[44:57] she was and and when she she smashed it
[45:00] on the ground she said there she said
[45:02] you'll never make me ugly again
[45:07] and the truth is she just finally saw
[45:09] herself for what she was
[45:12] we need to pass out the mirrors don't we
[45:15] and let people if people can only see
[45:18] what they really are
[45:19] but but that's difficult to do now we
[45:21] know that brother Branham taught us that
[45:23] the mirror is God's word he uh the Bible
[45:26] he he talked about how that the little
[45:28] boy had never seen a mirror and he went
[45:30] down to his aunt's house there in the
[45:32] city and he goes down and he sees a
[45:34] mirror and at the end of the hallway and
[45:37] he looks there's little boys standing
[45:39] there and he looks at me and he gets to
[45:40] wave and the little boy waved and
[45:43] uh he moved and little boy moved and
[45:45] finally he turned around he looked at
[45:47] his mother he said Mama he said that's
[45:49] me
[45:50] and he said that's the way we ought to
[45:52] be with the word of God that we can look
[45:54] in the mirror of God's word and identify
[45:57] our present character in that mirror
[46:00] that we ought to be able to see that the
[46:02] word matches what we are and what we do
[46:05] not just in church not just the this
[46:07] message did not come to restore us back
[46:10] to a church religion or restore us back
[46:12] where we can see that our services are a
[46:15] mirrored by gods or they should be but
[46:17] it's more than that it's a it's a
[46:18] reality in our everyday life that on
[46:21] Monday I can I can look in the mirror of
[46:22] the word and see I'm still a Christian
[46:24] on Tuesday on Wednesday all through the
[46:26] week I'm still a child of God
[46:29] and the mirror reflects my character
[46:32] shows me what I am
[46:35] in reality and so brother Brown in
[46:38] identification if you go in and listen
[46:40] to that I'd encourage you to do that he
[46:42] preaches this in 1963 preaches it
[46:44] several times but the one he preached in
[46:46] 1963 in January he said now let us look
[46:50] in God's mirror word and identify our
[46:54] present character
[46:57] not identify our church or identify the
[47:01] pastor or identify the people we're with
[47:04] or or even our own family but to
[47:07] identify ourself
[47:10] to identify me in the mirror of God's
[47:15] word do I match up
[47:17] am I what I should be I think every one
[47:20] of us ought to be willing to do that
[47:22] today
[47:24] now the problem with human nature
[47:27] is that we we don't want to look
[47:29] squarely in a mirror
[47:32] because the only way to get an accurate
[47:34] reflection see sometimes mirrors lie
[47:37] and the reason a mirror would lie is
[47:39] because of the angle at which you
[47:41] approach it or the amount of light
[47:43] that's on it or some object that would
[47:45] get in the way
[47:47] so if the mirror is the right mirror
[47:50] then you have to recognize that that the
[47:53] mirror is is an accurate reflection but
[47:56] it could be held in the wrong way and so
[47:59] many times what we do you know what you
[48:01] do and you take a selfie if some of you
[48:03] do that if you what you do is you take
[48:06] your phone and and you lift it up way up
[48:08] like this and you look down and try to
[48:10] get it where it won't show the double
[48:12] chin and and and you're taking you you
[48:15] you turn it like you've seen people do
[48:17] that and and only in our age you know
[48:20] there'll be there'll be a beautiful
[48:21] natural Vista in front of them and and
[48:24] creeks and mountains and things there'll
[48:26] be somebody like this you know
[48:29] they're not looking at what God made
[48:31] they're looking at them so well they are
[48:32] but they're looking at themselves
[48:35] and but they're they got it they want to
[48:37] check look the mirror they gotta turn it
[48:39] just right and make it just right where
[48:41] they're able to see themselves but they
[48:43] don't want to really want to see what
[48:45] they really are but what they're really
[48:47] viewing is is what what they want people
[48:49] to think that they are instead of what
[48:52] they are now they have the same mirror
[48:54] the same camera that you have but if you
[48:57] if you've ever been around Esther Esther
[48:58] can take some pictures she likes to take
[49:00] candid photos of people just random
[49:03] people she's probably got some of you
[49:04] all and and she does that to my mother
[49:06] every week she takes photos of a mom and
[49:09] sends them to her through the week and
[49:11] it just it might be you eating or the
[49:14] stewards experience that you know might
[49:15] be you sitting down in kind of an
[49:17] awkward Manner and and she does it she
[49:19] does it to me when I'm sleeping if I
[49:21] fall asleep in my chair or whatever that
[49:23] that is she she takes a picture of that
[49:26] and really that's what we really are
[49:29] that's the way we looked but you don't
[49:32] like that picture do you
[49:35] that's right there's a reason why we
[49:37] haven't had a family picture in about 10
[49:39] years
[49:42] we've decided we don't like the way
[49:44] we're aging
[49:46] now come on it was the time I like to
[49:48] look in the mirror but not now
[49:52] look but the mirror if it's God's word
[49:56] it must be held in such a way
[49:59] that the reflection is accurate yeah
[50:02] yeah that's why we have pastors that's
[50:04] why we have ministry that's why we have
[50:06] evangelists that's why we hold meetings
[50:08] because we want somebody we take the
[50:10] mirror take that selfie away from you
[50:12] let somebody else hold the mirror in
[50:14] front of us so we can see I need that
[50:16] you need that
[50:19] in our age God called a prophet to hold
[50:22] the mirror just right so we can see it
[50:24] in the correct lighting so we can see
[50:27] exactly what the word was
[50:31] so now we want to identify our true
[50:34] character
[50:36] so to get an accurate reflection you got
[50:38] to stand squarely before a full-length
[50:41] mirror
[50:42] in the proper light
[50:45] and look at the mirror
[50:48] now so it can't be a rough surface now a
[50:52] mirror has to be smooth there's a reason
[50:54] for that because if it's rough it'll
[50:57] it'll disperse the light rays
[50:59] because the mirror is just reflecting
[51:01] the Rays of light so a perfectly Steel
[51:04] Lake with nothing in it could be could
[51:06] you could see yourself in it but a lake
[51:09] that that's choppy and and the waves are
[51:11] going you can't see yourself in that
[51:13] Lake because the lights being scattered
[51:16] instead of reflecting
[51:18] so sometimes we need to calm down and
[51:21] get still and we need to recognize we
[51:24] need to just take an honest look
[51:26] in God's mirror so brother random tells
[51:29] us he said we we see in God's mirror not
[51:32] in your church mirror now in God's
[51:35] mirror and see if you could qualify in
[51:38] your life as being the spiritual bride
[51:41] of Jesus Christ
[51:43] so now
[51:45] and the only way we can do that by the
[51:46] way is by the blood of Jesus
[51:48] so you got to be able to look at
[51:50] yourself let him hold the mirror and
[51:52] look at yourself in the proper way
[51:54] but the Bible says it tells us about the
[51:57] nature of man it says there's a way that
[51:59] seems right into a man but the end
[52:01] thereof are the ways of death if you if
[52:02] you were to take a hundred different
[52:04] opinions you get a hundred different
[52:05] answers of what's right and what's wrong
[52:07] but today we go that's the reason we
[52:09] have the word God won't judge us by my
[52:12] opinion he won't judge us by Brother
[52:14] Joel's opinion brother Stewart's opinion
[52:16] or any of you brothers or sisters he
[52:17] won't do that but he judges Us by the
[52:20] mirror of the word
[52:23] so there's a way that seems right but
[52:25] the end they're over the ways of death
[52:27] proverbs 30 12 there is a generation
[52:30] that are pure in their own eyes oh we
[52:32] see that today don't we
[52:34] they think they're virtuous they think
[52:37] they're righteous yet they're not washed
[52:39] from their filthiness
[52:42] so men have this consistent inability to
[52:46] examine themselves Jesus dealt with this
[52:48] with the Pharisees in Matthew 7 and 3.
[52:50] he said why behold us thou the moat that
[52:54] word means the the speck
[52:56] or the Splinter
[52:58] that is in thy brother's eye
[53:00] but consider us not the beam the rafter
[53:04] the log
[53:06] that is in your own eye
[53:09] right so you can behold and you can you
[53:11] see it and that word behold means to
[53:13] look at from afar so you're way off
[53:16] you're not close to the situation you
[53:18] really don't know that much about it but
[53:20] you got an opinion about it anyway and
[53:22] you're able to look out and see oh
[53:24] there's a speck
[53:27] yeah
[53:29] there's a speck but in reality you don't
[53:32] know if there is one or not because you
[53:34] got an old beam in your own eye
[53:37] and even if you could go to that person
[53:40] now watch what he says next how will
[53:42] thou say to thy brother let me pull out
[53:45] the moat out of thine eye and behold a
[53:48] beam is in thine own eye
[53:50] in other words the brother is going to
[53:51] say well you can't see
[53:55] you wanna you wanna do surgery on me you
[53:58] want to take a pair of tweezers and grab
[54:00] the speck out of my eye and you've got a
[54:02] log in your eye yeah I'm gonna find me
[54:04] the old same physician here yourself I'm
[54:07] gonna find me a person that doesn't have
[54:09] a speck I'll tell you the only one that
[54:11] never had a speck was Jesus Christ
[54:14] yes sir how are you going to say to your
[54:17] brother let me pull out the people
[54:18] people can't tell they can't see
[54:20] themselves they see the spec yeah yeah
[54:24] far off in somebody else's eye in
[54:27] another church
[54:29] right in another place
[54:31] in the pastor of the trustees or the
[54:34] deacons or some other family or maybe in
[54:37] their wife or their husband
[54:39] but what about the log
[54:41] what about the the rafter the beam
[54:45] in your own eye yeah
[54:47] Jesus says Thou hypocrite
[54:49] First cast out the beam out of thine
[54:52] owner it's good that you want to help
[54:54] people
[54:55] but make sure that you can see clearly
[54:58] before you go to picking specks
[55:01] out of your brother's eye
[55:04] So and I've seen it so much and I I just
[55:07] preaching to you this morning as a
[55:10] pastor would and and just so that we'll
[55:13] understand well you get criticized
[55:15] sometimes and and it's just that's going
[55:18] to come you can't do anything without
[55:19] criticism and brother Branham said that
[55:22] Jesus walked unconscious of criticism
[55:24] and he said he never did pay any
[55:27] attention it didn't change the critics
[55:28] he said didn't change what Jesus did
[55:30] right they say that was the difference
[55:32] in General Grant and and the other Union
[55:35] Generals that went against Lee the other
[55:37] Union Generals were always trying to
[55:38] figure out what league was doing and and
[55:40] General Grant just said well we got more
[55:42] men we got more equipment we got more
[55:44] time we're gonna we're gonna just do
[55:46] what we do
[55:47] and we'll forget about General Lee we'll
[55:50] just do what we do and he ended up
[55:52] defeating him and and so that's what
[55:53] we've got to do but you get criticism
[55:56] and I know we have meetings and things
[55:58] and I know there's people that think
[56:00] we're fanatical they need to come to
[56:02] church sometime and and see I don't
[56:04] think we're fanatical enough
[56:06] we could we could handle a little bit
[56:09] more praise a little bit more worship a
[56:10] little more Hallelujah we can handle a
[56:13] little bit more
[56:14] hey I'll be honest with you I I think uh
[56:17] if you get out of control we'll we'll
[56:19] let you know but
[56:21] people get critical because they're just
[56:23] going to find something to criticize and
[56:25] and but they fail to see and if we're
[56:28] not careful we'll do the same thing
[56:30] you see because our own beam we can't
[56:33] see it yeah people critical of
[56:35] fanaticism in the eye of another church
[56:37] but can't see that their own flock is
[56:39] suffering yeah
[56:41] yeah right losing your you lose your
[56:43] young people you got no move of the
[56:45] spirit at all and they're going out and
[56:47] becoming homosexuals and everything else
[56:49] listen it's a real thing
[56:52] and you're going to criticize somebody
[56:54] because they love God somebody because
[56:56] they worship somebody but you didn't
[56:58] know you don't know what that person
[56:59] come out of you don't know what their
[57:01] past is you don't know what they've
[57:03] overcome to be in the house of God
[57:06] I mean you may have been always a
[57:08] Christian you may have always done
[57:10] everything just right but as long as I'm
[57:12] in this flesh in this body I worship God
[57:15] with all of my heart and the reason is
[57:17] because I know what I was I know what I
[57:19] can save me from I know what he's kept
[57:22] me from the Native and I'm not going to
[57:23] be afraid to worship it
[57:26] all right you can be critical all you
[57:29] want to but I don't want to be in the
[57:30] house for the critic I don't want to sit
[57:32] in the seat of the scoring
[57:36] fail to see people suffering and dying
[57:39] yeah
[57:42] well they're Fanatics I'd rather be a
[57:44] fanatic
[57:45] for Christ
[57:47] and sit and die
[57:49] but again it's easy for us
[57:52] for for everybody to get that
[57:54] to get that that beam in your eye start
[57:58] looking for specks
[57:59] expecting your eye was just them old
[58:02] dirty glasses
[58:05] you ever done that your glasses get
[58:08] dirty
[58:09] I Can See Clearly Now
[58:12] can't see much at all
[58:15] a speck in the eye I don't like to wear
[58:17] glasses I did I put it off to us almost
[58:19] 30 years old wearing glasses finally
[58:21] couldn't put it off any longer I
[58:23] couldn't see road signs no more
[58:25] and I finally quit you know I missed a
[58:27] few exits and I finally quit finally
[58:29] gave up and went to the went to the
[58:31] doctor but every once in a while there's
[58:33] a speck on your eye and you think my
[58:34] goodness my goodness why don't they wash
[58:36] those windows
[58:38] laughs
[58:40] I remember I sat in church for years and
[58:43] complained I complained for years in
[58:45] fact we bought a bigger screens in the
[58:47] church I was going to because I thought
[58:49] that you you couldn't read the screen
[58:51] those too small I thought it was blurry
[58:55] and I got glasses
[58:57] it's like praise God
[59:01] now I can see
[59:03] but it's hard to evaluate ourselves
[59:07] it's hard to look at herself
[59:09] it's easy to look at somebody else and
[59:11] say well hey they need to lose weight
[59:15] he's too emotional he's not emotional
[59:17] enough he he's a fanatic he's cold but
[59:20] it's hard to look at yourself
[59:24] yeah the round said a good road is built
[59:26] the highest part is in the center
[59:27] because it lets all the trash wash off
[59:29] both sides he said when a man really
[59:31] comes to Christ he's got his eyes
[59:32] centered on Christ if he's a little bit
[59:35] emotional he'll be a fanatic if he's a
[59:37] little bit cold he'll get on this other
[59:39] side and be just a cucumber
[59:41] over on that side see his intellectual
[59:43] but the main thing is right in the
[59:45] middle of the road with enough spirit in
[59:47] you keep you warm and moving and knowing
[59:49] enough to keep yourself under obedience
[59:51] to the spirit to move just as the spirit
[59:54] moves not dealing not after just as the
[59:56] spirit moves
[59:58] again he talked about a lot of rain
[1:00:00] Brethren that had pulled off from the
[1:00:02] main group he said that's right
[1:00:03] different with the group of Brethren
[1:00:05] that pulled off here not long ago from
[1:00:06] The Way of Light he said they just
[1:00:08] couldn't see the phenomena being done
[1:00:09] unless they made themselves a group so
[1:00:11] they gathered up in Canada made a group
[1:00:13] of people that they were going to give
[1:00:14] out and make Apostles and Prophets out
[1:00:16] of one another and things he said it
[1:00:18] fell right through and it always will he
[1:00:21] said they feel that because if they are
[1:00:22] he said they don't listen he said they
[1:00:24] so condemned the other things
[1:00:26] till they go Plum on the other side
[1:00:29] he said there's one side that's highly
[1:00:31] intellectual cold and indifferent they
[1:00:33] deny everything there and the others get
[1:00:35] on the other side on the other side with
[1:00:36] a radical bunch of emotion that deny the
[1:00:38] word
[1:00:39] but you know the problem was never the
[1:00:41] emotion the problem was denying the word
[1:00:44] he said but the real true church stays
[1:00:45] right in the middle of the road
[1:00:47] he said if you notice it's got the Bible
[1:00:49] knowledge of what God Said and it's
[1:00:51] spiritual enough to be warm in his heart
[1:00:53] and it's just the road
[1:00:55] but you better be looking right in the
[1:00:57] mirror and it'd be held right yeah yeah
[1:01:00] that's why we don't want to Discount
[1:01:01] what the message says
[1:01:04] all right God called that man for a
[1:01:06] reason
[1:01:08] there's a reason why president said what
[1:01:09] he said
[1:01:10] you know just lightly take lightly what
[1:01:13] brother Brandon said
[1:01:14] because he God called him to hold the
[1:01:16] mirror
[1:01:17] he wasn't even the mirror but he was
[1:01:19] called to hold it in a way we could see
[1:01:22] what this age ought to be and how to
[1:01:24] apply the word to the life of a believer
[1:01:27] in this age
[1:01:29] now
[1:01:31] the foolish man
[1:01:32] and you just let me preach for a minute
[1:01:35] this morning I appreciate your patience
[1:01:37] but I I just want to get this off my
[1:01:39] heart I'm not preaching at you but I
[1:01:41] just want us to be to to always examine
[1:01:44] ourselves to know where we're at
[1:01:46] the foolish man doesn't need anyone to
[1:01:48] straighten his mirror
[1:01:50] he's a law in his own eyes and he's got
[1:01:54] everything just so oh you know I don't
[1:01:56] want nobody to tell me what to do I've
[1:01:58] had people tell me that I I can't take
[1:02:00] any instruction I don't want any and be
[1:02:02] honest with you you can't force them to
[1:02:04] do it all right you can't make them take
[1:02:06] instruction you can't make them listen
[1:02:07] and so you just back off and you just
[1:02:09] let them go because a person's got to
[1:02:11] find out for themselves
[1:02:13] but but the foolish man you know it's a
[1:02:16] foolish thing to do to not take counsel
[1:02:19] right it's a foolish thing to not accept
[1:02:22] accept things when it's a right thing
[1:02:24] you know it's one thing to take counsel
[1:02:26] from somebody who's uh who's done
[1:02:28] everything wrong but it's another thing
[1:02:30] if you see somebody that they've
[1:02:32] succeeded in a certain area you want to
[1:02:34] take counsel from them
[1:02:36] they say the biggest obstacle to making
[1:02:38] money in business is people trying to
[1:02:39] reinvent the wheel
[1:02:42] they're trying to redo it and they said
[1:02:44] what you ought to do is go find somebody
[1:02:45] who's done it before because there's
[1:02:48] nothing new Under the Sun
[1:02:50] and so if you find somebody who's been
[1:02:52] successful as a principal somebody
[1:02:53] you've been successful as a teacher
[1:02:55] somebody's been successful are you with
[1:02:57] me now somebody's been successful as a
[1:02:59] pastor somebody who've been successful
[1:03:00] in their marriage find that person and
[1:03:02] talk to them
[1:03:05] right because that's the person that
[1:03:07] ought to be able to know and and maybe
[1:03:10] they're holding maybe they can hold a
[1:03:11] mirror in the right angle and so but a
[1:03:13] foolish man doesn't need anybody he
[1:03:16] won't let nobody come up to him and say
[1:03:17] well hey you know that angle you're
[1:03:19] holding that don't show you just right
[1:03:21] he just said oh my I'm I'm thin
[1:03:25] I'm beautiful
[1:03:29] oh praise God the way I worship God is
[1:03:32] just right
[1:03:37] say well God doesn't accept all worship
[1:03:39] that's right they don't he don't accept
[1:03:40] your will worship
[1:03:42] he doesn't accept you worshiping just
[1:03:44] the way you want to
[1:03:46] that's true he doesn't he doesn't accept
[1:03:48] you worshiping outside the blood
[1:03:50] but God don't God don't accept your your
[1:03:53] hypocrisy and legalism either
[1:03:56] well the way I do it man
[1:03:58] it's just right
[1:04:00] God help us today
[1:04:04] you know you know ultimately the reason
[1:04:06] that people have I'm just preaching this
[1:04:08] morning
[1:04:09] you know why people believe most of what
[1:04:11] they believe because they believe it
[1:04:17] why is that true you know you've been
[1:04:20] told I I was told lots of things by my
[1:04:23] mother and
[1:04:28] you know she told me if I if I held my
[1:04:31] face that way and stay that way
[1:04:33] you've been told that
[1:04:37] if you if you sit too close to the
[1:04:39] screen you'll you'll go blind you know
[1:04:40] and lots of things and that may be true
[1:04:43] I there's probably some some element of
[1:04:46] truth but if you really go get down to
[1:04:47] it it's true and you know why your mama
[1:04:50] told you why
[1:04:51] because I said so
[1:04:54] that's why
[1:04:56] hahaha if I say the Earth is flat and I
[1:04:58] pay your bills
[1:05:00] and give you your cereal in the morning
[1:05:02] and and fix you dinner at night as long
[1:05:04] as I'm cooking for you and what I say
[1:05:07] goes
[1:05:08] right but we can't be that way when it
[1:05:10] comes to the word
[1:05:12] and because of every every fool is right
[1:05:14] in his own eyes that's what the Bible
[1:05:16] says the way of a fool is right in his
[1:05:19] own eyes but he's at hearken the Thunder
[1:05:21] counsel is wise
[1:05:26] and that's I know people don't want
[1:05:29] somebody tell them what to do but that's
[1:05:30] our job
[1:05:32] as ministers not to reinvent the mirror
[1:05:35] not to hold up something else but to
[1:05:36] take the mirror of God's word and just
[1:05:38] point it right at the people
[1:05:41] right that's my job it's to take it and
[1:05:44] just hold it right here where you can
[1:05:46] see that's Harold Bailey in the word
[1:05:48] that that's Glenn in the word that's me
[1:05:51] in the word
[1:05:55] we don't want to always hear that
[1:05:57] and the minister don't always want to
[1:05:59] hold it that way
[1:06:01] it's got to be done
[1:06:05] we could look at
[1:06:07] I always told people
[1:06:10] I'd Rather somebody told me
[1:06:12] if I had a a wardrobe malfunction my
[1:06:15] collar was turned up
[1:06:17] if my button came off
[1:06:19] something like that
[1:06:21] somebody please come tell me
[1:06:23] yeah because I can't see myself standing
[1:06:26] up here
[1:06:27] right so I always did that for brother
[1:06:30] Ivey if he come out with his collar
[1:06:31] turned up like that you know and he'd
[1:06:33] come out and everybody's sitting there
[1:06:34] going like this you know you can't look
[1:06:35] at that's hard isn't it that's tough
[1:06:38] hope I got it down
[1:06:41] it came out like that and I just walk up
[1:06:43] behind him and turn it down
[1:06:46] there's a reason for that I'd Rather
[1:06:48] somebody fixed it just just move my
[1:06:51] mirror
[1:06:52] that's why we ought to pray when we come
[1:06:54] to the house of God
[1:06:55] move that mirror where where I can see
[1:06:57] myself
[1:06:59] because I'm not good at looking and
[1:07:01] finding what's wrong with me
[1:07:03] but I know that the word is a discerner
[1:07:05] of the thoughts and the intents of the
[1:07:07] heart and he's gonna sometimes I think
[1:07:09] I'm not going to make it sometimes I
[1:07:10] think I've done too much I've done too
[1:07:12] many bad things but the word is a
[1:07:14] discerner the thought sentence of the
[1:07:16] heart and the word knows there's a seed
[1:07:18] on the inside that's going to make it
[1:07:20] there's a seed that's going to be there
[1:07:21] there's that you were there before in
[1:07:24] the mind of God before the foundation
[1:07:25] the word knows
[1:07:27] you're not good at holding up the mirror
[1:07:29] but he is
[1:07:35] so brother Branham takes his
[1:07:36] identification he said we can look at
[1:07:37] different ages and see ourselves if we
[1:07:39] looked honestly we could look at I don't
[1:07:41] have time to go through all the quotes
[1:07:42] this morning but if we could be with
[1:07:43] Cain or Abel we could be with Noah or
[1:07:46] the scientists yeah
[1:07:48] so he says you you identify a character
[1:07:50] in The Bible That's how you look in the
[1:07:52] mirror
[1:07:53] you identify a character in The Bible
[1:07:55] and see how your image fits that
[1:07:57] character
[1:07:58] how your character fits their character
[1:08:01] would you be Abraham with Abraham or lot
[1:08:05] would you be with Esau or Jacob Moses or
[1:08:08] Nathan we can look at that in hindsight
[1:08:10] and say well with Moses because Nathan
[1:08:12] got swallowed up but what about before
[1:08:13] he got swallowed up
[1:08:16] right with Esau or with Jacob rather
[1:08:19] because we know what the end of Esau was
[1:08:21] but what you would you have been with
[1:08:23] Jacob before
[1:08:25] would you have been with Abraham when he
[1:08:27] went up in the plane of mammary and
[1:08:30] nothing seemed to be going right
[1:08:31] and law is down there partying having a
[1:08:34] good time become the mayor of the city
[1:08:35] who would you spend your time with
[1:08:38] who would you stand with
[1:08:40] oh we need to take sides with Jesus
[1:08:42] today
[1:08:43] so brother Brown would use all those
[1:08:45] types and but then he taught us that the
[1:08:47] perfect example that we ought to be
[1:08:49] looking at because all of those men had
[1:08:51] flaws all of those women had flaws but
[1:08:54] now Jesus is the perfect example for all
[1:08:57] of us
[1:08:58] to be able to see in the mirror and see
[1:09:00] what kind of a character we ought to
[1:09:01] have he said now Jesus gave us the
[1:09:03] example of what we ought to be looking
[1:09:04] at when he reflected his life to us
[1:09:07] through the word what we should see when
[1:09:10] we look into God's mirror we should see
[1:09:12] ourself identified with him
[1:09:15] he said that is a perfect example your
[1:09:17] pastor will never be a perfect example
[1:09:19] the church will never be a perfect
[1:09:21] example but when I concede the word made
[1:09:24] flesh that is a perfect image of what
[1:09:26] God wanted all right
[1:09:28] do you believe that today
[1:09:30] amen and he said and when we he said
[1:09:33] when we seen it when he seen that his
[1:09:34] creation had fallen
[1:09:36] I love this you need to go listen to the
[1:09:38] sermon I don't have time to to give it
[1:09:40] justice this morning brother Brown
[1:09:42] preaches identification he preaches
[1:09:43] about Christ he said when he seen that
[1:09:45] his creation had fallen
[1:09:47] he said now his own loving character
[1:09:50] molded himself into the person of Christ
[1:09:55] so the atmosphere of Christ was a result
[1:09:58] of the character of God Elohim poured
[1:10:02] himself into Christ and the character or
[1:10:05] the atmosphere of Christ but the man
[1:10:06] talks about how each one of us in that
[1:10:08] sermon he talks about each one of us are
[1:10:09] a Dynamo he said we're a Dynamo we
[1:10:12] create an atmosphere around us
[1:10:14] and so the atmosphere that we create is
[1:10:16] a result of our character
[1:10:18] atmosphere is character expressed
[1:10:21] you ever thought about that it's hard to
[1:10:24] put on a right atmosphere that's right
[1:10:26] because atmosphere is character
[1:10:28] expressed the atmosphere of the world
[1:10:31] today is the character of Satan
[1:10:33] expressed he could not create it but he
[1:10:36] but he perverts it into an atmosphere
[1:10:38] and it shows us the character of Satan
[1:10:40] but the atmosphere in the Garden of Eden
[1:10:42] shows us the character of God
[1:10:45] right well there's no death no suffering
[1:10:47] none of that and so it shows us his
[1:10:48] character but now what God was
[1:10:52] Oh my he molded himself
[1:10:55] into the person of Christ that was God's
[1:10:59] character on display God's atmosphere on
[1:11:03] display and brother Brandon taught us
[1:11:05] that's why he had to be born of a virgin
[1:11:07] he could not come by sexual desire
[1:11:09] because the the he said even as good as
[1:11:12] those other women were
[1:11:14] he could not even be the egg could not
[1:11:16] even be from the woman
[1:11:18] you understand what I'm saying this one
[1:11:19] he could not it had to be all God he
[1:11:22] said because it would have been any part
[1:11:23] of the women he said Sarah was a good
[1:11:25] woman and all these other women were
[1:11:27] good women but it could not be part of
[1:11:29] them
[1:11:30] because if it had been part of them but
[1:11:32] the dead he didn't he would have
[1:11:33] expressed some part of him would have
[1:11:35] expressed the character of Sarah or the
[1:11:37] character of Rebecca or the character of
[1:11:39] any of these other women
[1:11:40] but when he came he did not express the
[1:11:43] character of Joseph he did not express
[1:11:44] the character of Mary he did not express
[1:11:46] the character of the disciple but he
[1:11:49] expressed the character of God himself
[1:11:53] God pouring himself into a life
[1:11:57] that's why when people tell me he said
[1:11:58] where brother Daryl Ward last Saturday
[1:12:00] morning did such a marvelous job
[1:12:01] preaching about Christ's suffering and
[1:12:03] what he did for us people say well we're
[1:12:05] beyond that how are we beyond God
[1:12:07] himself
[1:12:08] how are we beyond the character of God
[1:12:11] himself expressed to us
[1:12:14] how could we ever get beyond that
[1:12:18] had a person one time leave this church
[1:12:20] and tell me they didn't go here to
[1:12:22] church but they came on Sunday and they
[1:12:24] left and they told somebody well said he
[1:12:26] don't uh he don't preach and I don't
[1:12:28] think he bad towards them just the way
[1:12:30] they're geared but that he Don't Preach
[1:12:31] modern day
[1:12:33] he don't pre he Don't Preach where we're
[1:12:34] at today he just preaches 2 000 years
[1:12:36] ago well if you can't see what he did
[1:12:39] for you 2 000 years ago you can't see
[1:12:42] what he's doing for you right now
[1:12:43] because he's the same yesterday today
[1:12:46] and forever
[1:12:47] he expressed his character for a reason
[1:12:55] Paul said I
[1:12:58] will read it just won't be thinking I'm
[1:12:59] not robbery but making himself equal to
[1:13:01] God
[1:13:02] he said see his own character molded
[1:13:04] that kind of a person
[1:13:07] he said no one could ever do that but
[1:13:10] God
[1:13:10] and he said that explains to us John 3
[1:13:13] 16. for God so loved the world
[1:13:16] that he gave his only begotten son that
[1:13:19] whosoever believeth on him should not
[1:13:21] perish but have everlasting life he said
[1:13:23] I used to think that the father was
[1:13:24] angry with me but Jesus loved me and I
[1:13:27] find out through the same person
[1:13:29] right God so loved he said he was that
[1:13:31] great attribute of God Called Love
[1:13:34] he was in one place he said he was the
[1:13:37] very heart of God
[1:13:38] and it was expressed in a person
[1:13:41] he said god Jehovah overshadowed a
[1:13:44] virgin and created the blood cell
[1:13:46] and when that was born it was the son of
[1:13:49] God
[1:13:49] in other words it was a tabernacle it
[1:13:51] was a dwelling place where Jehovah could
[1:13:53] live among his people and express
[1:13:55] himself what he was
[1:13:58] now if there had been any part of me
[1:14:01] in that expression I would have made
[1:14:04] life a little bit easier
[1:14:07] I'm just being honest with you because
[1:14:09] of Human Experience
[1:14:11] right we try to make life easier on our
[1:14:14] children
[1:14:14] as we rightfully should but it's our
[1:14:16] Human Experience
[1:14:18] right that's taught us that we we in our
[1:14:20] Human Experience we've learned I'd
[1:14:22] rather not do without
[1:14:23] I'd rather have have things
[1:14:26] I'd rather live in a certain way and so
[1:14:29] there had been any expression of the
[1:14:31] character of been through it in Christ
[1:14:33] he would have not come the way he came
[1:14:37] oh God
[1:14:39] he would not have done what he did
[1:14:42] if there had been any don't you see why
[1:14:44] we work all of our Lives posted I keep
[1:14:46] under my body and bring it under
[1:14:48] subjection unless having preach to
[1:14:50] others I myself become a Castaway
[1:14:52] because if there was any part of Jeremy
[1:14:55] Erskine in that in that flesh of Jesus
[1:14:57] Christ he would not have manifested
[1:15:00] right then if he wants to manifest
[1:15:02] himself back the other way what do we
[1:15:04] have to do we Hope Church we've got to
[1:15:07] get to the place where there's no part
[1:15:09] of us just still expressing our old gift
[1:15:12] our old man is still there but Paul said
[1:15:14] I keep it down I keep it under it's
[1:15:17] still prickly it's still awful but what
[1:15:19] do we have to do we have to express his
[1:15:22] word
[1:15:27] oh my
[1:15:31] I would want the best
[1:15:35] I would want the brightest to be there
[1:15:38] to record my birth
[1:15:40] if I was going to be born and be God
[1:15:43] he chose Shepherds
[1:15:47] listen
[1:15:49] he chose a Manger
[1:15:51] he says
[1:15:53] he said what an example how that the
[1:15:55] holy God made manifest
[1:15:57] and then notice what he did he took the
[1:15:59] place of the servant to wash feet can we
[1:16:02] hold up the mirror for a minute this
[1:16:04] morning
[1:16:05] just look at it honestly
[1:16:07] honestly
[1:16:09] he said he took the place of a servant
[1:16:11] to wash feet
[1:16:13] and spoke that the birds have nests and
[1:16:16] the foxes have dents but I don't have a
[1:16:19] place
[1:16:20] to lay my head
[1:16:22] and we get so worried about having
[1:16:25] things
[1:16:26] and having money and all these things I
[1:16:29] don't say you we should take care of our
[1:16:31] children we should make as much money as
[1:16:32] we can I'm all for it
[1:16:36] I'm all for it because the better the
[1:16:37] people live the better the ministry can
[1:16:39] live
[1:16:42] I'm all for that
[1:16:45] but I'd rather see you love God with all
[1:16:47] of your heart
[1:16:49] I'd rather see if you might be poor as a
[1:16:51] church mouse I might have to pay tithes
[1:16:52] to you for you to come to church and you
[1:16:55] might be so poor that you can't hardly
[1:16:56] make it I'd rather see you poor and
[1:16:58] living for God I'd rather see you poor
[1:17:00] and love in your family I'd rather see
[1:17:01] you poor and live in the way God wants
[1:17:04] you to live
[1:17:05] that's what he did
[1:17:08] we have comfortable I have a comfortable
[1:17:10] home you have comfortable homes I've got
[1:17:11] nice cars you didn't
[1:17:15] huh
[1:17:17] said what an example
[1:17:19] he said how would our life reflect to
[1:17:21] his
[1:17:22] and he made the example of what we
[1:17:24] should do I don't say you shouldn't have
[1:17:25] nice things but don't let that be all of
[1:17:27] your choices
[1:17:28] don't let all of your choices just
[1:17:30] reflect the carnal urge to become a
[1:17:33] greater Hunter a greater fisherman have
[1:17:35] a drive a nicer car have a better have a
[1:17:37] better home don't let everything that
[1:17:39] you do reflect that but let it be the
[1:17:41] Inner Man of the Heart Lord how can I
[1:17:43] build my character I'm not going to
[1:17:45] deliberately do something to hurt my
[1:17:46] family but how can my character become
[1:17:48] the character of Christ how can I be
[1:17:50] molded into more humble take suffering
[1:17:53] in the right way how can I be humbled
[1:17:54] into that character
[1:18:01] he said we should see him when you look
[1:18:03] in the mirror we should see him
[1:18:05] when we look in the mirror
[1:18:07] he says see Christ the mirror of his
[1:18:09] word how he did that
[1:18:11] for love
[1:18:13] he said now you study that character a
[1:18:15] little bit and then look at yourself and
[1:18:16] I look at myself but that's what he was
[1:18:17] that's who he was
[1:18:20] that's why he was
[1:18:23] I love that
[1:18:24] that's what he was that's who he was
[1:18:27] that's why he was to save you yes he
[1:18:30] become you that you might become him or
[1:18:33] have we lost our sense of of all in the
[1:18:36] presence of that statement he become you
[1:18:38] that you might become him he took your
[1:18:40] load of sin
[1:18:42] therefore when we come to meet him we
[1:18:44] will not have to stand we could not
[1:18:45] stand in the presence of God there's no
[1:18:47] way for us to do it but when we stand in
[1:18:49] him he's already recognized that
[1:18:51] sacrifice this is my beloved Son in whom
[1:18:54] I'm well pleased he recognized it there
[1:18:56] was no blemish on him yet he suffered
[1:18:58] Temptation like any other man yet he was
[1:19:00] scorned he was made fun of he was
[1:19:02] persecuted from the hour he was born
[1:19:04] until he died and yet he returned good
[1:19:06] for evil let me be that way Lord he was
[1:19:09] first you from the hour he was born
[1:19:10] until the hour he died but he always
[1:19:12] returned good for evil
[1:19:14] you cannot no way ever produce a
[1:19:16] character like that only accepting that
[1:19:18] character in you a church cannot do that
[1:19:20] can you hear me this morning a church
[1:19:22] cannot do that a Creed cannot do that a
[1:19:24] denomination cannot do that and
[1:19:26] education cannot do that it must be a
[1:19:28] birth it's got to be a dying Outlet God
[1:19:31] in by the grace of Christ mold this type
[1:19:33] of character in you that you become him
[1:19:36] and your life and his is the same then
[1:19:38] you are Sons and Daughters of God
[1:19:41] Hallelujah
[1:19:43] let's look some more in the mirror
[1:19:46] you know
[1:19:47] the Bible teaches us he was our example
[1:19:49] in humility yeah
[1:19:51] everyone thinks they're humble
[1:19:54] laughs
[1:19:56] all right let's just be honest
[1:19:59] very few people
[1:20:01] very few people you know
[1:20:04] every time I get thinking about my own
[1:20:05] humility I'm proud of it
[1:20:11] why do you want
[1:20:14] I humbled myself man
[1:20:18] it's the truth just the way we are
[1:20:22] everybody thinks but does our humility
[1:20:24] match what you see in the mirror
[1:20:29] you said but but you don't understand
[1:20:31] where I came from or what was done to me
[1:20:33] no that's not what we're supposed to
[1:20:35] match
[1:20:36] we don't want any part of us in it does
[1:20:38] our humility match what we see in the
[1:20:40] mirror are we arrogant I'm Amazed and
[1:20:44] how arrogant people can be
[1:20:47] after being stupid
[1:20:51] look at Saul in the Bible King Saul
[1:20:54] he walks up there and the prophet stands
[1:20:57] in front and said you've not done what
[1:20:58] God told you to do the King Saul stood
[1:21:00] there and said
[1:21:01] I've done everything
[1:21:04] before a man he knew was a Vindicated
[1:21:06] Prophet the only reason he was King is
[1:21:08] because that man was prophet yeah
[1:21:09] and yet he stood there and said
[1:21:12] I got no faults look at King David
[1:21:15] when a man come up and said and Nathan
[1:21:17] tells him the story about the about the
[1:21:19] one who stole the lamb and King David
[1:21:21] said he ought to die
[1:21:23] [Music]
[1:21:25] look at the arrogance of that
[1:21:27] you ought to die God had mercy on David
[1:21:30] the prophet stuck his finger in his face
[1:21:33] and said you're the man
[1:21:37] oh God everybody thinks they're humble
[1:21:40] but does our humility match what we see
[1:21:42] in the mirror Philippians 2 and 5 let
[1:21:44] this mind be in you let this mind
[1:21:47] being you which was also in Christ Jesus
[1:21:49] if you ever wanted to think like
[1:21:50] Einstein
[1:21:53] I imagined when I was young that I could
[1:21:55] do that now I can't even remember my
[1:21:56] wife's name sometimes
[1:21:58] and that's not because I've had more
[1:22:00] than one I've only had one
[1:22:07] but when I was young I I thought because
[1:22:10] I had a big head I had a big brain
[1:22:14] I couldn't find out it wasn't the same
[1:22:18] let this mind not the mind of Einstein
[1:22:22] not the mind of of somebody some great
[1:22:25] scientist or not the mind of some
[1:22:27] preacher not the mind of some great man
[1:22:29] but this mind the mind of Jesus yes this
[1:22:33] mind which was also in Christ Jesus who
[1:22:36] being in the form of God
[1:22:39] is not robbery to be equal with God in
[1:22:43] other words he knew who he was
[1:22:45] but he made himself of no reputation
[1:22:48] brother random taught us the man who
[1:22:50] invented the the false knee has a
[1:22:51] reputation the man who invented the the
[1:22:54] the false hip the fake hip has got a a
[1:22:56] reputation because he did something good
[1:22:58] for Humanity but the man who made the
[1:23:00] original one made himself of no
[1:23:02] reputation
[1:23:03] he took upon him the form of a servant
[1:23:05] and was made in the likeness of men yeah
[1:23:10] yeah that's a humble thing when you're
[1:23:12] God
[1:23:13] to become a man yeah
[1:23:16] and being found in fashion as a man he
[1:23:19] humbled himself and became obedient unto
[1:23:22] death even the death of the Cross
[1:23:23] wherefore God also has highly exalted
[1:23:26] him given him a name which is above
[1:23:28] every name that at the name of Jesus
[1:23:30] every knee should bow things in heaven
[1:23:32] things and Earth things under the Earth
[1:23:33] every time she confess that Jesus Christ
[1:23:35] is Lord to the glory of God the Father
[1:23:38] I want you to notice how Jesus did
[1:23:40] Ministry he didn't push himself on
[1:23:43] people
[1:23:45] I didn't say give me a job let me preach
[1:23:49] right
[1:23:50] I'm not preaching any of my preachers
[1:23:52] here because God knows y'all y'all
[1:23:55] always willing to give up the pulpit
[1:24:01] but so I'm not preaching at you but
[1:24:03] that's the way we ought to be sometimes
[1:24:04] you know you want something you want to
[1:24:06] be seen Jesus didn't didn't push himself
[1:24:09] look what he did in Mark 7 31.
[1:24:11] are you still with me this morning I I
[1:24:13] don't want to wear you out I can always
[1:24:15] quit
[1:24:18] Mark 7 31 again departing from the coast
[1:24:20] of Tire I mean quit this sermon I'm not
[1:24:22] gonna quit all together
[1:24:25] somebody like praise is the Lord
[1:24:31] he said again departing from the coastal
[1:24:33] tire and sight on you come into the Sea
[1:24:35] of Galilee through the midst of the
[1:24:36] coast of decapolis and they bring unto
[1:24:37] him one that was death and I had an
[1:24:40] impediment in his speech and they
[1:24:42] beseeched him to put his hand upon him
[1:24:44] he's deaf and he can't speak well
[1:24:46] because he can't hear
[1:24:48] huh
[1:24:49] and he took him aside from the multitude
[1:24:52] put his fingers in his ears and he spit
[1:24:54] and touched his tongue
[1:24:56] he he said brother man God don't accept
[1:25:00] all worship y'all have been prayer lines
[1:25:02] and such and people people are people
[1:25:04] are getting too emotional explain to me
[1:25:06] why Jesus spit and touched the tongue of
[1:25:08] this man
[1:25:12] and why he only did it once and didn't
[1:25:13] do it again
[1:25:15] why are you spitting the clay that time
[1:25:17] and put clay in a man's eyes and told
[1:25:19] him to go wash and the man had to
[1:25:21] stumble down to the pool asking for
[1:25:23] directions
[1:25:25] until he went and washed himself in the
[1:25:27] pool and then he could see
[1:25:29] yeah explain that
[1:25:31] God does what he wants to
[1:25:33] right we got to let God do what he wants
[1:25:34] yeah
[1:25:37] what we don't want is a form of worship
[1:25:39] whether it's a form of emotion or a form
[1:25:41] of anything else we want God to be able
[1:25:44] to do what God wants to do
[1:25:48] spitting touch this time what I don't
[1:25:51] fit covert protocols at all
[1:25:54] looking up to heaven he sighed
[1:26:01] that is be opened
[1:26:04] and straightway his ears were opened
[1:26:07] and the string of his tongue was loosed
[1:26:10] and he spake plain
[1:26:13] you know sometimes I have to take a baby
[1:26:16] because her tongue is tied
[1:26:18] God did a surgery
[1:26:20] miraculous on this man
[1:26:22] and it says he speak plain and he
[1:26:25] charged them that they should tell no
[1:26:28] man but the more he charged them so much
[1:26:31] the more a great deal they published it
[1:26:35] I don't have time to go through all the
[1:26:37] scriptures this morning but you could go
[1:26:38] and look in the New Testament and Jesus
[1:26:40] is constantly saying one thing don't
[1:26:42] tell nobody
[1:26:44] over and over and over and I'll be
[1:26:46] honest with you the human part of me
[1:26:48] when I see God doing something
[1:26:49] supernaturally and doing something
[1:26:51] wonderful like what he's done for you
[1:26:52] and I think we should testify I'm not
[1:26:54] against testifying but that it helps us
[1:26:56] because we are human
[1:26:58] right it helps us because we are human
[1:26:59] but God you know when he come on the
[1:27:02] earth he he was constantly telling the
[1:27:04] people don't tell it
[1:27:07] uh
[1:27:09] and he wasn't it wasn't because he
[1:27:11] didn't want him to worship he wanted
[1:27:12] them to come and worship
[1:27:14] what the oh God
[1:27:17] he didn't want the people
[1:27:19] he didn't want the people to
[1:27:22] you realize that Jesus did not want the
[1:27:24] people to make him an idol
[1:27:28] that's a hard statement for us to hear
[1:27:32] Jesus did not want the people to make
[1:27:34] that flesh an idol
[1:27:36] and that's only when they come to him
[1:27:37] said great Master he said don't call me
[1:27:39] great why you call me great
[1:27:41] there's one great and that's God
[1:27:43] don't tell nobody about it
[1:27:46] today we want to make prophets Idols we
[1:27:48] want to make pastors Idols we want to
[1:27:49] make people idols
[1:27:51] Jesus didn't want that perfect flesh to
[1:27:54] be an idol yeah
[1:27:56] he said don't tell nobody about it look
[1:27:58] at his humility and he wasn't doing that
[1:28:00] to put on
[1:28:01] he wasn't doing that because he's
[1:28:02] thinking well if I tell him not to tell
[1:28:04] then they'll tell and then it'll seem
[1:28:06] more you know more generic and be more
[1:28:09] like it really happened that more
[1:28:10] organic that that's not what he was
[1:28:12] doing
[1:28:13] it was from his heart
[1:28:16] now look
[1:28:17] and they were beyond measure astonished
[1:28:20] so people were saying he had done all
[1:28:22] things well
[1:28:23] I like that response to the move of the
[1:28:26] Holy Ghost I like that response to what
[1:28:28] God does I don't understand why he spit
[1:28:30] on his on his finger and touches the lip
[1:28:33] to the man's lips I don't understand why
[1:28:35] he's spit in the sand and touch the
[1:28:37] Man's eyes with Clay I don't understand
[1:28:39] why he raised the dead in one instance
[1:28:41] and in another instance he did it a
[1:28:42] different way and in another instance he
[1:28:44] did it another way why would one place
[1:28:45] he sends everybody out and in another
[1:28:47] place he does it publicly I don't
[1:28:49] understand but he does all things well
[1:28:52] oh my can we say him into that today
[1:28:55] whatever he's done in my life he did
[1:28:56] well
[1:29:00] make it both the Deft of here and the
[1:29:02] dumb to speak
[1:29:03] and now the disciples weren't like this
[1:29:07] the disciples he gave him power to
[1:29:09] overcome devils
[1:29:11] right they were working under that
[1:29:12] Authority he gave them in Luke 10 17 and
[1:29:16] 70. remember they went out and cast out
[1:29:18] devils and healed the sick and the
[1:29:21] seventy returned again with joy
[1:29:23] oh praise God even the devils are
[1:29:26] subject unto us through thy name
[1:29:30] and Jesus
[1:29:32] I love this because I detect a little
[1:29:35] bit of humor
[1:29:37] in verse 18.
[1:29:40] because Jesus knew who he was and these
[1:29:43] 70 come back said we can do the same
[1:29:44] thing you can Jesus my goodness why look
[1:29:46] at all this look at this we're casting
[1:29:47] out Devils all over the place and and he
[1:29:49] said you know I saw Satan as lightning
[1:29:52] fall from Heaven
[1:29:57] I said boy you guys are powerful one
[1:29:59] place brother Brandon said you you told
[1:30:01] him he said you you shook the devil
[1:30:04] you shook that he really did tell you
[1:30:06] what boys man well if I could only have
[1:30:08] a Ministry like yours you know
[1:30:10] yeah
[1:30:12] you shook the devil your healing
[1:30:15] campaigns
[1:30:17] but there's more to it I think than even
[1:30:18] that because if you've been to look at
[1:30:20] you begin to realize that he said I'll
[1:30:22] be held Satan fall Satan fell from his
[1:30:24] position
[1:30:26] Jesus condescended
[1:30:28] and came down
[1:30:31] Satan had to be removed
[1:30:34] oh God
[1:30:36] Jesus voluntarily took the lowest place
[1:30:42] he said Jesus told the people he said
[1:30:44] when you go his disciples said when you
[1:30:46] go to a feast he said don't sit in the
[1:30:49] top spot because you think you're the
[1:30:50] most important person
[1:30:52] he said because there might be somebody
[1:30:53] more important than you
[1:30:55] and I want to say this in all of our
[1:30:57] services in all of our meetings there's
[1:30:59] somebody more important than the
[1:31:00] preacher there's somebody who is Christ
[1:31:02] the word
[1:31:04] because he said when you go to the feast
[1:31:06] he said don't take the top spot because
[1:31:08] there might be somebody and you'll be
[1:31:10] embarrassed when you get removed out of
[1:31:12] that seat
[1:31:14] oh God
[1:31:15] oh God but but they were always because
[1:31:16] they didn't have the Holy Ghost they
[1:31:18] didn't have not that carnal nature was
[1:31:19] shining through even though they had
[1:31:20] power with God but they didn't have the
[1:31:23] Holy Ghost and it didn't control their
[1:31:25] lives and so he's teaching them a lesson
[1:31:27] now brother Branham when he deals with
[1:31:29] this scripture I've beheld Satan as
[1:31:31] lightning fall from Heaven he says this
[1:31:33] he said see Satan was the original
[1:31:34] Archangel of God he once dwelt in the
[1:31:36] heaven he once was the greatest person
[1:31:37] in the heavens outside of God he was
[1:31:40] God's right hand man to Fellowship he
[1:31:42] got puffed up in his heart
[1:31:44] isn't that just the way that people get
[1:31:46] today let God just bless a fellow and
[1:31:48] put a little confidence in him he gets
[1:31:50] to be a know-it-all he gets to start an
[1:31:52] organization or he's got something
[1:31:53] that's different why aren't that fallen
[1:31:55] from Heaven o Lucifer
[1:31:57] he said God has a hard time trying to
[1:31:59] get somebody he can deal with that'll
[1:32:01] stay humble and meek and stay in the
[1:32:03] place until God calls him to do
[1:32:04] something he said a man that God can
[1:32:06] bless and he'll still keep himself a man
[1:32:09] and not be an angel or a god well I
[1:32:11] thank God for this message of the hour
[1:32:13] because we we had a Prophet come in our
[1:32:15] day that was all God blessed him above
[1:32:17] he had a Ministry like no other but yet
[1:32:20] he kept himself a man
[1:32:22] he kept himself a man it would not be
[1:32:25] called an angel or a god
[1:32:29] said as soon as man gets blessed and has
[1:32:31] a little something given to him he wants
[1:32:32] to become a god
[1:32:33] he wants to become an angel
[1:32:35] he wants to become some great person
[1:32:38] what I do
[1:32:40] yeah what me
[1:32:42] and mine
[1:32:47] brother Daryl
[1:32:48] I'm praying for brother Daryl he's had
[1:32:50] booked him today he's doing a little bit
[1:32:52] better today
[1:32:53] watch brother Daryl Ward Serve the
[1:32:55] People of God and
[1:32:56] and just really give his body sacrifices
[1:32:59] his bodies people of God but he he told
[1:33:01] me something years ago and I heard him
[1:33:02] repeat it to a young preacher this
[1:33:04] weekend and really it's true
[1:33:06] it's good advice
[1:33:08] he said there's two dangerous times in
[1:33:10] your ministry
[1:33:11] that when you first start and then when
[1:33:14] God begins to use you
[1:33:16] those are dangerous times
[1:33:18] because you begin to think you're
[1:33:19] somebody yeah
[1:33:22] well look at that I did good you know
[1:33:26] you got to have confidence in what
[1:33:28] you're doing
[1:33:29] you got to know that you're called
[1:33:31] right but it's a dangerous place
[1:33:35] because when God begins to use you then
[1:33:37] you begin to think oh
[1:33:38] well I'm so much better than I was maybe
[1:33:41] it's just your season
[1:33:43] all right that well I'm a better
[1:33:45] preacher maybe it's just your season I
[1:33:46] was talking about the David earlier you
[1:33:48] know our lives are like this and we see
[1:33:50] what our lives are you forgive me for
[1:33:52] just a minute you see what our lives are
[1:33:54] and then you see there's a little maybe
[1:33:56] you change one thing
[1:33:58] maybe you went to McDonald's one time
[1:34:00] change that
[1:34:03] right one thing about one day
[1:34:06] but but maybe instead of being who you
[1:34:08] are you're quadriplegic it had a wreck
[1:34:11] right yeah you change one little thing
[1:34:14] yeah
[1:34:15] yeah I've told you the story how one
[1:34:17] time I got a job because I looked in my
[1:34:18] my spam email folder
[1:34:20] and have been sitting there for months a
[1:34:22] job offer and I've been sitting that
[1:34:24] whole time griping about my job wanting
[1:34:26] a different job and it was all the time
[1:34:28] in my email folder
[1:34:30] right but me just happened to check it
[1:34:32] because usually I just hit the delete
[1:34:34] button and that day I happened to check
[1:34:36] it and it changed the course of my life
[1:34:39] right and it changed the course of my
[1:34:41] family see things
[1:34:43] we look at little things just little
[1:34:45] bitty things can make such a difference
[1:34:47] and that's why we always ought to look
[1:34:49] up and see when we're sitting there
[1:34:50] under that apple tree that's what's
[1:34:52] talked about we don't want to just sit
[1:34:53] there and eat the apples we want to look
[1:34:55] up and see where's it coming from
[1:34:57] there's one little difference in your
[1:34:59] life for the day you don't know just a
[1:35:00] millisecond of difference how many times
[1:35:02] have you almost gotten a wreck or almost
[1:35:04] to this or maybe you did and it changed
[1:35:06] you
[1:35:07] or maybe you had and I look at pastors
[1:35:09] that have had cancer or heart trouble or
[1:35:11] something like that and you look at how
[1:35:13] it changes their Ministry and I think
[1:35:14] that's that I'm not immune to that
[1:35:17] right things can change one little
[1:35:20] moment one little time brother Ben
[1:35:22] preaches from that time and he talks
[1:35:24] about how from that time everything
[1:35:25] changes
[1:35:26] one more wrong decision or one little
[1:35:28] right decision and you don't have that
[1:35:30] much to do with it but you don't realize
[1:35:31] what it's leading to
[1:35:32] right I think I believe we ought to be
[1:35:34] thankful today I believe we ought to
[1:35:36] worship today I believe we're blessed
[1:35:38] today to be where we are
[1:35:43] to be what we are
[1:35:46] brother Branham
[1:35:48] talked about this one that wanted me and
[1:35:49] me and mine he said that's the wrong
[1:35:50] attitude God's hunting for somebody who
[1:35:52] he could bless and pour out the
[1:35:54] blessings and the more he blessed the
[1:35:56] little of the man will become oh help me
[1:35:58] Lord he said you'll never get more of
[1:36:00] God until you become nothing you've got
[1:36:02] to belittle yourself he that will exalt
[1:36:04] himself God will bring a base he that
[1:36:06] will humble himself God will exalt
[1:36:08] you've got to get little before you can
[1:36:09] get big and you'll never be big in your
[1:36:12] own self you'll only be as big as God
[1:36:14] will be big in you oh I say God be big
[1:36:17] in me today be big in my family be big
[1:36:19] in the church be big I can't be big
[1:36:21] enough to make the meet the challenge of
[1:36:23] the hour God be big in me
[1:36:30] Jesus knew they were in danger
[1:36:33] when they come up there and they said
[1:36:35] all the devils are subject to us
[1:36:38] and a few days later they would all
[1:36:40] desert him
[1:36:42] and then Judas would even betray him
[1:36:45] look what he said in verse 19 behold I
[1:36:47] give it to you power to tread on
[1:36:48] serpents and scorpions
[1:36:50] and over all the power of the enemy and
[1:36:53] nothing shall by any means hurt you
[1:36:56] I said praise God
[1:36:58] he said notwithstanding in this Rejoice
[1:37:01] not that the spirits are subject unto
[1:37:04] you but rather Rejoice because your
[1:37:07] names are written in heaven
[1:37:12] he was King Of Heaven
[1:37:14] yet he didn't have a place to lay his
[1:37:16] head
[1:37:16] his name in heaven was all-powerful but
[1:37:19] on Earth it was cursed
[1:37:21] spies
[1:37:23] it was our example and humility with our
[1:37:24] example in suffering
[1:37:26] we'll dwell in this for just a minute
[1:37:28] and we'll go
[1:37:30] he said servants first Peter 2 18 be
[1:37:32] subject to your masters with all fear or
[1:37:35] respect
[1:37:36] not only to the good and gentle but also
[1:37:38] to the fro word that word forward is the
[1:37:40] word scolios is where you get scoliosis
[1:37:42] crooked
[1:37:43] right
[1:37:45] so in other words he's saying there's
[1:37:46] going to be bosses that are crooked
[1:37:48] praise God
[1:37:50] it's just gonna happen
[1:37:52] but he's dealing with and he deals with
[1:37:53] bosses in different places now God will
[1:37:56] allow you to have at times crooked
[1:37:59] perverse harsh employers
[1:38:02] but God forbid that we would be that
[1:38:05] right now he brother Brown said this I
[1:38:08] wonder tonight if many people here and
[1:38:09] listening tonight he said hasn't cheated
[1:38:11] their neighbor just a little bit done a
[1:38:12] little crooked deal
[1:38:14] he said I pray that if that be the case
[1:38:15] you'll hear the tinkling of that money
[1:38:17] till it sends you to your knees of
[1:38:19] repentance
[1:38:20] well brother Ben how did you get on that
[1:38:25] we if we have the character of Christ if
[1:38:28] we see ourselves in the mirror of the
[1:38:30] word he would rather he be defrauded
[1:38:33] than to defraud someone else
[1:38:37] he would rather himself be used
[1:38:40] than to use
[1:38:42] someone else
[1:38:44] oh God
[1:38:45] see we should be honest even if we
[1:38:47] suffer for it
[1:38:49] a man who will take advantage of another
[1:38:51] man from personal gain is a man who
[1:38:52] needs to be born again
[1:38:54] and that works for employers and
[1:38:56] employees
[1:38:58] because if you get if you become an
[1:39:00] employee for somebody and and you just
[1:39:03] wanna you just want to sit there and do
[1:39:05] nothing and not work then you'll have to
[1:39:07] answer for to God for that
[1:39:09] but if you become an employer of someone
[1:39:12] and you think well this is the way I'm
[1:39:13] going to get rich is by employing
[1:39:15] especially a brother or a sister God
[1:39:17] help us
[1:39:19] that we would think that way about
[1:39:21] people who work for us because a man who
[1:39:23] will take advantage of another man from
[1:39:25] personal gain is a man who needs to be
[1:39:26] look in the mirror again say it that way
[1:39:29] because he didn't do that
[1:39:31] I've seen pastors that were willing to
[1:39:33] take advantage of people
[1:39:36] financially God forbid
[1:39:39] God forbid that I would get more than I
[1:39:42] give
[1:39:43] are you with me now I'm just making
[1:39:45] myself an example not to you but an
[1:39:47] example of uh uh in the sense of how I
[1:39:50] should act
[1:39:51] look I want to be I want to be one who
[1:39:54] gives more than I get because God's been
[1:39:56] so good to me he's been so good to me
[1:39:59] let me be one who is even if people do
[1:40:02] me wrong I don't give that back
[1:40:04] I'm not going to abuse you because you
[1:40:06] abused me yeah
[1:40:08] yeah Lord help me to understand how
[1:40:11] lucky I am are you with me this morning
[1:40:13] help me to know help me to see in the
[1:40:15] mirror and see how blessed I am and see
[1:40:17] that I'm a blessed man I may have had
[1:40:19] troubles but I'm a blessed man I refuse
[1:40:21] to gripe constantly sometimes I gripe
[1:40:24] but every time I begin to cry I begin to
[1:40:26] think Lord you and your word I could
[1:40:28] have been anything but you would by Your
[1:40:30] Word have molded me and and brought me
[1:40:32] into a place where I never dreamed I
[1:40:34] could be in spiritually speaking Lord I
[1:40:37] want to stay there help me to stay there
[1:40:39] I owe it all to you I'm a blessed man
[1:40:41] can you say Amen to that today we're a
[1:40:44] blessed people
[1:40:48] he said this is think worthy of a man
[1:40:50] for conscience toward God
[1:40:52] and that's doing the right thing because
[1:40:54] it's the right thing to do
[1:40:58] God forbid that we as ministers would
[1:41:00] leave a name of being a con man
[1:41:04] for for decades
[1:41:06] God forbid
[1:41:08] huh
[1:41:12] I still hear about it ministers they've
[1:41:13] even passed on or ones that claim to
[1:41:15] believe this message I'm not talking
[1:41:17] about anybody sitting here people that
[1:41:18] claim to believe this message and they
[1:41:20] they passed on and and then you come
[1:41:22] back and look or maybe they're they're
[1:41:24] still living but they're getting older
[1:41:26] and you look at their life and just one
[1:41:27] con after another
[1:41:29] God forbid
[1:41:31] just preaching to you this morning
[1:41:33] if I have to be walked on let me be
[1:41:35] walked on
[1:41:37] this is think worthy if a man for
[1:41:39] conscience toward God endure grief
[1:41:41] that's hard for me to preach that way
[1:41:43] church not my nature but I want to make
[1:41:45] sure I want to make sure that we
[1:41:47] understand we should not take that
[1:41:49] from people
[1:41:51] we should not take that and what I mean
[1:41:53] what I mean by that is you don't have to
[1:41:54] give it back to them but you don't have
[1:41:56] to sit there and be swindled either
[1:41:59] huh
[1:42:01] if if a man for conscience toward God
[1:42:03] endure grief suffering wrongfully what
[1:42:06] glory is it if will you be buffeted for
[1:42:09] your faults you shall take it patiently
[1:42:12] or they slap you around because you're
[1:42:13] false
[1:42:15] but when you do well
[1:42:17] and suffer for it because sometimes you
[1:42:20] will
[1:42:21] you take it patiently this is acceptable
[1:42:24] with God and this is much harder than it
[1:42:27] sounds
[1:42:28] you try to bring people together you get
[1:42:30] criticized on every side but why keep
[1:42:32] doing it we're going to do it again
[1:42:33] we'll keep doing it why keep doing it
[1:42:35] because it's right
[1:42:38] yeah right
[1:42:40] he said for even hearing too where you
[1:42:42] called because Christ also suffered for
[1:42:43] us leaving us an example that you should
[1:42:46] follow his steps
[1:42:48] that word example is I've preached it to
[1:42:50] you before it's the model of handwriting
[1:42:52] copy by Schoolboy here's the handwriting
[1:42:54] you see it up on the wall the perfect
[1:42:56] example of what it ought to be but I
[1:42:58] never could do that but the Bailey never
[1:42:59] could write just like what they wanted
[1:43:01] me to write but I remember as a
[1:43:03] kindergartner when when the my teacher
[1:43:05] come down and she took my hand and she
[1:43:07] wrote it looked just like what was on
[1:43:08] the board why because I just gave myself
[1:43:11] into the hand of the teacher that's what
[1:43:13] we need to do today that's the only way
[1:43:15] that we can express the character of
[1:43:16] Christ let us give ourselves into the
[1:43:18] hand of the teacher where he can write
[1:43:20] the perfect example
[1:43:22] what we ought to be
[1:43:25] who did no sin neither was guile that's
[1:43:28] deceit treachery
[1:43:31] oh God I read this I said Lord let me be
[1:43:34] without Kyle as a pastor
[1:43:36] let the deacons be without God the
[1:43:38] trustees the congregation let us not be
[1:43:40] a people who do things for an ulterior
[1:43:43] motive
[1:43:44] let us be as people who do things for
[1:43:47] the right reasons because it's the right
[1:43:49] thing to do
[1:43:50] he said let love Romans 12 9 let love be
[1:43:53] without the simulation in other words
[1:43:54] let it be let it be truthful let it be
[1:43:56] honest let it not be fake
[1:43:59] unfined he said the end of the
[1:44:00] Commandment is out of a pure heart of a
[1:44:02] good conscience of Faith unfeigned or
[1:44:04] not not a fake Faith but a real faith
[1:44:06] but random sit there in that token he
[1:44:08] said it's a positive token that your
[1:44:10] lamb died you received a token upon
[1:44:11] yourself his very life is in you there
[1:44:13] is no make-belief there is no put on
[1:44:15] there is no impersonation it's there you
[1:44:18] know what the world knows that the token
[1:44:19] is there you don't have to hold the
[1:44:20] mirror up like this and say Well when
[1:44:22] I'm in church I I'm a Believer I have
[1:44:24] the token but what about at home
[1:44:26] put it right in front of you look
[1:44:28] squarely at it
[1:44:31] yeah look at the example in the mirror
[1:44:33] verse 23 who when he was reviled
[1:44:37] oh this is hard
[1:44:42] reviled not again
[1:44:45] publicly or privately right
[1:44:48] right how do you know that brother Ben
[1:44:49] because Judas none of the other
[1:44:50] disciples knew who Jesus was or Judas
[1:44:52] was
[1:44:54] he didn't revile publicly he could have
[1:44:56] called James and John aside and say well
[1:44:59] come here
[1:45:00] you know what he told him he said one of
[1:45:01] you is a devil
[1:45:04] just so they would know that he knew
[1:45:07] they had no clue who it was
[1:45:13] do you have to move the mirror a little
[1:45:15] bit
[1:45:16] would I have to move the mirror a little
[1:45:18] bit to look like Jesus
[1:45:21] let me go a little bit farther does the
[1:45:23] man in the mirror more like Jesus and
[1:45:25] we're like Judas
[1:45:29] Judas sought Revenge
[1:45:33] yeah
[1:45:34] Jesus embarrassed Judas when he the
[1:45:37] woman's feet was washed Jesus mildly
[1:45:39] rebukes him it embarrassed him he said
[1:45:42] from that time he began to seek
[1:45:44] he began to seek to destroy him yeah
[1:45:46] because he didn't like the preaching of
[1:45:48] the word
[1:45:49] he couldn't look in the mirror that
[1:45:51] Jesus died for his enemies yeah said
[1:45:55] father forgive them they don't know what
[1:45:56] they're doing
[1:45:57] he said to his own self bear our sins in
[1:46:00] his own body on the tree that we being
[1:46:02] dead to sins should live unto
[1:46:03] righteousness by whose Stripes you were
[1:46:05] healed can you place yourself there with
[1:46:07] him
[1:46:09] I don't believe we can without the Holy
[1:46:10] Ghost
[1:46:11] we're not able to change ourselves but
[1:46:14] the Bible says we all with an open face
[1:46:16] beholding as in a glass the glory of the
[1:46:19] Lord our change into that same image
[1:46:22] oh I'm so glad for the changing power of
[1:46:24] the Holy Ghost I'm so glad when I come
[1:46:27] in the presence of God he said we're
[1:46:28] changed from glory to glory people say
[1:46:30] well it's just word only no that's not
[1:46:32] what the Bible says we're changing to
[1:46:34] the image of the word by the glory from
[1:46:36] glory to glory
[1:46:37] the glory is the Shekinah Glory the
[1:46:40] presence of the pillar of fire he said
[1:46:41] even by the spirit of the Lord
[1:46:44] we must be like him we must be like him
[1:46:47] how we must receive the Holy Ghost yield
[1:46:49] to it and make footprints in the
[1:46:50] promises of God I'm closing now so
[1:46:53] musicians want to go ahead and come he
[1:46:55] said it's Mo as Moses was changing the
[1:46:57] presence of the pillar of fire we have
[1:46:58] to be changed from glory to glory

[1:47:04] Healing if it's for more blessing if
[1:47:06] it's for anything that God promised make
[1:47:08] Footprints what do you have need of this

[1:47:15] meet a man in the mirror to look more
[1:47:16] like Jesus make a footprint in the land

[1:49:40] you to Bow your heads with me
[1:49:41] [Music]
[1:49:45] brother Branham taught us that there's
[1:49:46] coming a day we'll see him face to face
[1:49:49] he said now we've been looking through a
[1:49:50] glass Darkly but soon it'll be face to
[1:49:52] face
[1:49:53] he said we've been going from glory to
[1:49:55] glory but soon it'll be right in the
[1:49:57] glory
[1:49:58] and His glory will shine
[1:50:00] we shall be like him wondrously like him
[1:50:03] Jesus our savior divine
[1:50:06] he said we're completing him that's true
[1:50:08] he would not lie to us about that
[1:50:11] one day we'll be changed in the atoms we
[1:50:15] will put on immortality we will be all
[1:50:18] swallowed up in life
[1:50:21] oh I'm looking forward to that day Lord
[1:50:23] change me from glory to glory because I
[1:50:27] know from one day the glory will be
[1:50:30] present

[1:50:33] change me to where I would be
[1:50:36] comfortable being in your presence let
[1:50:39] me my character build an atmosphere
[1:50:42] around me that people want to be in that
[1:50:45] people will just they may not they may
[1:50:48] not agree with me but may my character
[1:50:49] build an atmosphere that my wife can't
[1:50:52] wait to for me to come home my kids
[1:50:54] can't wait for me to be around because I
[1:50:56] the character of Jesus
[1:50:58] created such an atmosphere in my life
[1:51:01] let me look straight into the mirror of
[1:51:04] the word
[1:51:06] where I'm wanting Lord change me
[1:51:09] let your your presence move me oh God I
[1:51:13] touch your prayer this morning as we
[1:51:15] just talked to him for a moment oh
[1:51:17] Heavenly Father
[1:51:19] Lord we've heard how we're blessed
[1:51:22] or we've heard the importance of the
[1:51:24] word and all of these things the Rapture
[1:51:26] coming
[1:51:28] hard to be in that image
[1:51:30] to be there with you and be able to be
[1:51:33] Kings and Priests in that land to be
[1:51:36] the judge even judge angels
[1:51:38] or I look at myself and I think how
[1:51:40] could I do that
[1:51:41] Lord one day we'll be changed even that
[1:51:43] sticky nature will be gone
[1:51:45] so thankful for that Lord
[1:51:47] while I'm here
[1:51:49] oh God
[1:51:50] let me be humble like you were Lord
[1:51:53] I fail so much in that Lord
[1:51:56] it's just the devil we're trying to make
[1:51:59] us complain about complainers
[1:52:01] or revile those that revile us
[1:52:04] oh God help us today
[1:52:07] Lord help us to be right help me Lord
[1:52:11] I want to be right
