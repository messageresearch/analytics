[29:11] going to read first peter chapter one
[29:12] to start off and then we're gonna turn
[29:14] to first corinthians chapter eight
[29:16] and we'll speak from there tonight
[29:20] isn't the word of the lord good you all

[29:30] change or anything like that hopefully
[29:32] we'll be able to get through it and
[29:34] continue to have the services the way we
[29:35] do and first peter chapter one and verse
[29:38] 22.
[29:41] it says seeing you have purified your
[29:42] souls and obeying the truth through the
[29:44] spirit
[29:46] unto unfeigned love of the brethren
[29:49] you know what that means if we would
[29:51] just stop there you can't love your
[29:53] brother
[29:54] right without the holy spirit you
[29:57] purified your souls and obeying the
[29:59] truth
[29:59] through the spirit unto unfeigned love
[30:02] of the brethren
[30:03] see that you love one another with a
[30:05] pure heart
[30:07] fervently i pray the lord without his
[30:09] blessing to the word you may be seated
[30:12] this evening
[30:16] first corinthians chapter 8 is one of
[30:18] those chapters that we read but we
[30:20] really don't read
[30:23] we drive by it and look and
[30:26] we've seen it before and talks about
[30:28] idols and
[30:30] things that we don't really deal with
[30:31] today but i think it's much more
[30:33] relevant than what we realize because it
[30:36] speaks about our relationship with one
[30:37] another and with the brethren and
[30:39] what knowledge is i want to title this
[30:42] knowledge versus
[30:43] love we couldn't
[30:46] if we had paid attention to first
[30:48] corinthians chapter eight and i'll just
[30:50] speak for myself
[30:51] if i had paid attention to it i could
[30:53] have saved myself a lot of trouble in
[30:54] life
[30:55] and maybe more of us could have with all
[30:58] the debates that go on
[31:00] about inconsequential things and and
[31:04] we forget about what really matters and
[31:06] paul is is focused on what really
[31:08] matters first corinthians chapter 8 and
[31:09] verse 1.
[31:11] paul begins this way he said now as
[31:12] touching things offered
[31:15] unto idols now this is this is a
[31:17] question
[31:18] that paul has been asked and it is
[31:21] something like this
[31:22] isn't it true that we can eat meat
[31:24] offered to idols
[31:26] based on your doctrine of grace meat
[31:28] shouldn't matter
[31:29] you know what they were right about that
[31:33] and but the thing is you can be right
[31:36] and still be wrong
[31:39] and so he he kind of rebukes them for
[31:41] being right the
[31:42] corinthians just can't seem to win but
[31:46] he gets on to him a little bit because
[31:49] of the way they applied it now
[31:51] this would have been food left over from
[31:54] the great pagan sacrifices
[31:56] and what he's dealing with here in this
[31:58] chapter is is food that was left over
[32:00] and then
[32:01] either sold in the market or fed to the
[32:02] people directly
[32:04] he also deals in a different place with
[32:07] actually the the feasts that they would
[32:09] have at the temple and those were
[32:11] forbidden for christians that
[32:13] they were not to go there but they could
[32:15] buy the meat
[32:16] and and paul deals with that now it
[32:19] would have been much cheaper or may have
[32:21] been free
[32:22] to do that and so the people said hey
[32:24] why can't we take advantage of this
[32:27] government largesse and and have some
[32:30] meat that's been offered to idols
[32:32] because it doesn't mean anything
[32:34] paul says you're right but you're wrong
[32:38] because the way that you're doing it now
[32:40] the early church lived at the
[32:42] intersection of spiritual freedom and
[32:44] pagan culture
[32:46] and we may not think we live there today
[32:48] but we do
[32:50] we live right at the intersection of
[32:52] spiritual freedom and
[32:54] and pagan culture and so especially this
[32:57] time of year you begin to think about
[32:58] those things and see those things and
[32:59] realize that's where we live
[33:01] the culture that we live in is pagan
[33:04] it's not a christian culture anymore
[33:05] this country
[33:06] hasn't been a christian nation in a long
[33:08] time
[33:10] and they've turned down god and and so
[33:12] we live at that intersection where the
[33:14] world is pagan
[33:16] and and we live there we're in it but
[33:18] not of it and
[33:19] this this idea of not eating food
[33:21] offered to idols was dealt with
[33:23] several times in the scripture paul
[33:25] deals with it in romans
[33:26] also the jerusalem council in acts 15
[33:30] decided to allow the gentiles to to
[33:33] remain uncircumcised but asked him not
[33:35] to do certain things
[33:36] one of the things they asked them not to
[33:37] do was to not eat food offered to idols
[33:40] and
[33:40] the biggest reason was to promote unity
[33:44] because when they would eat together the
[33:47] jews just wouldn't partake of that
[33:49] the people that had been jews that had
[33:50] come into the message of that day
[33:53] they just wouldn't be a part of it and
[33:55] so they asked them not to do that it's
[33:56] mentioned again
[33:57] in revelations 2 14 speaking about
[34:00] balaam
[34:01] who taught israel to eat things
[34:03] sacrificed to idols
[34:04] also in revelations 2 20 in the next
[34:07] church age he
[34:08] spoke of jezebel who did the same thing
[34:10] but brother branham talks about that and
[34:12] he said that was spiritual in the
[34:13] pergamian church age he said the eight
[34:15] things
[34:15] sacrificed to idols he said no i don't
[34:18] say that this really means they were
[34:19] literally eating meat sacrificed to
[34:21] idols
[34:23] for although the council of jerusalem
[34:24] had spoken against such
[34:26] paul did not make much of it as he said
[34:28] the idols were nothing
[34:29] he said it was just a matter of
[34:31] conscience except for it offended a
[34:32] weaker brother and then it was not
[34:33] allowed
[34:34] now but if you go on and i encourage you
[34:36] to go home and i don't have time to read
[34:38] it tonight for sake of time but
[34:40] if you go home and if you have a chance
[34:42] read the rest of that paragraph because
[34:43] brother branham talks about how that
[34:45] the church spiritually was partaking in
[34:48] spiritual idolatry
[34:51] and they were eating that meat
[34:52] sacrificed idols in that way it was
[34:55] it was the food the spiritual food that
[34:57] they were getting
[34:59] now in the second part then of that
[35:02] verse in first corinthians 8 1 it says
[35:04] we know that we all have knowledge
[35:06] now i think we could probably say that
[35:08] about one another
[35:10] we know that we all have knowledge and
[35:13] paul's kind of
[35:15] getting at him a little bit with that
[35:16] because paul says i agree with you we
[35:18] have this knowledge
[35:20] but they had the wrong application with
[35:22] it now brother branham talks about
[35:24] about knowledge and the way people treat
[35:27] one another and be not afraid of his
[35:29] eyes
[35:29] that i was called today by some of my
[35:30] sponsors on a meeting they called me
[35:33] long distance
[35:34] he said this afternoon a group of
[35:35] pentecostal ministers not baptist
[35:38] presbyterian but pentecostal ministers
[35:40] and confessed that they had believed not
[35:42] in divine healing
[35:43] and wanted me not in the city and
[35:45] wouldn't sponsor a meeting where they
[35:47] prayed for the sick
[35:49] he said pentecostal ministers pitiful
[35:51] isn't it
[35:54] see those quotes aren't all the way on
[35:55] the screen we had a power outage this
[35:57] afternoon so it's not
[35:58] my fault this time i guess it messed
[36:01] that up
[36:02] and he said i had another call that from
[36:04] a group that said if you let another
[36:06] group sit on the platform with you will
[36:07] have nothing to do with it
[36:10] well that sounds familiar doesn't it
[36:13] if you have a certain preacher in we
[36:15] won't use him anymore
[36:17] and and brother branham says that's
[36:19] worse off than ever
[36:21] he said what's the matter he said you've
[36:22] gone off without him speaking of christ
[36:27] we won't deal with you because you had
[36:28] you you said something nice about
[36:30] somebody we don't like
[36:32] it's like kids on the playground right
[36:36] and that's the way they were at the
[36:36] corinthian church
[36:40] right now he said
[36:44] he said that's worse than ever that
[36:46] what's the matter gone off without him
[36:47] the love of god in our heart constrains
[36:48] us to reach every denomination
[36:51] in every place when it gets to a spot
[36:54] that you can't have a tender love for
[36:55] every human being something's happened
[36:57] to you
[36:58] because god so loved you when you was a
[37:00] sinner aren't you glad he did
[37:02] an alien away from god an enemy of the
[37:04] commonwealth of god he so loved you
[37:06] that he gave his life for you amen
[37:10] he said if you get a spirit in you that
[37:12] you're better than someone else
[37:15] listen to this if you get a spirit in
[37:18] you
[37:18] that you're better than someone else
[37:20] then you're worse
[37:22] than anybody else that i know of
[37:26] that's pretty bad
[37:32] he said i don't care if you're ever so
[37:34] correct in your theology your motives
[37:36] and objectives is wrong
[37:38] he said i'd rather be wrong in my
[37:40] theology
[37:42] than be wrong in my heart that's right
[37:44] because the spirit of god dwells in your
[37:46] heart he said i'd rather be right in my
[37:47] doctrine and write in my heart
[37:49] or wrong in my doctrine rather than
[37:50] right in my heart be better to be both
[37:53] but he said i'd rather be wrong in my
[37:54] doctrine and right in my heart god will
[37:56] respect it more
[37:58] he said so if a man is wrong what of it
[38:00] help him
[38:01] he needs help love him if you can't love
[38:04] your enemy the same as you love those
[38:05] who love you
[38:07] you're no better off than the publicans
[38:08] that's right he said that's what the
[38:10] church has failed
[38:11] to get brother branham says something
[38:14] interesting in church order when he's
[38:15] talking to
[38:16] about the deacons and how they had to
[38:18] deal with people because
[38:20] being a deacon can be hard and and
[38:22] brother
[38:23] danny say man to that i'm sure after his
[38:25] years of service but
[38:26] it can be difficult because you're
[38:27] dealing with people
[38:29] any time you're dealing with people it's
[38:31] can be difficult
[38:32] and so they said are we handling this
[38:34] wrong brother said no you're not you
[38:36] have to tell people the truth
[38:38] but he says this he said you don't want
[38:39] to get like oswald
[38:42] and he's referencing something that had
[38:43] just happened that
[38:45] that oswald you remember it went out and
[38:47] harvey oswald had went out and shot the
[38:49] president
[38:51] he said you don't want to get like
[38:52] oswalt you don't want to get to a point
[38:55] where you disagree with somebody so much
[38:56] you're willing to kill him
[38:59] and that's kind of the age we live in
[39:01] isn't it
[39:02] people have gone to extremes and and
[39:05] what happens is if you can demonize
[39:07] somebody
[39:08] you can be an extremist right so if you
[39:10] can demonize someone
[39:12] because you disagree with them and i
[39:14] i've pondered this a lot lately because
[39:16] i preached about how that we have to
[39:18] recognize that we we could be wrong or
[39:21] at least
[39:21] that a person could be wrong about
[39:23] something and write about other things
[39:26] right someone we disagree with and you
[39:29] don't want to get like oswald where
[39:31] because the man is wrong about something
[39:34] you're going to demonize him to the
[39:35] point that his life doesn't matter
[39:39] huh and you wouldn't care if he lost his
[39:42] life
[39:43] you wouldn't care what happened to him
[39:45] because you disagree with him that's
[39:47] wrong
[39:50] he said you don't want to get like
[39:51] oswald see if you can't disagree with a
[39:53] man
[39:53] and things and then shake his hand still
[39:55] the same feelings towards him
[39:56] then there's something wrong with you
[40:00] he said if i can't disagree with a man
[40:02] bitterly from one side to the other and
[40:04] still think as much of him
[40:05] as christ would that's a that's a high
[40:08] order isn't it that's a tall ask right
[40:12] there
[40:13] think of as much of a man as christ
[40:15] would how much
[40:16] did jesus think of us that's a tall
[40:19] order paul said love your
[40:20] your wife as christ loves the church
[40:22] that's a tall order
[40:24] think of as much of a man as as christ
[40:27] would
[40:28] even though you disagree with him he
[40:29] said then there's something wrong with
[40:30] my spirit i haven't the spirit of christ
[40:32] if he says well brother branham i
[40:33] believe your teaching is this that
[40:36] all right brother let's come together to
[40:37] reason you and i we'll take it ourselves
[40:40] we'll go over here in the room to
[40:41] ourself we'll reason it out
[40:42] he said he just cuts me to pieces and i
[40:44] have to say things back to him
[40:46] it's in my heart i can't feel the same
[40:48] about him
[40:49] that he's still my brother and i'm
[40:50] trying to help him then i'll never help
[40:52] him
[40:53] there's no way for me to help him
[40:56] if i don't love him he said what's the
[40:58] use of going over there
[40:59] he said tell him in the first place
[41:01] first brother i don't love you let me
[41:02] get that out of my heart right here
[41:04] before we go in there because i can't
[41:06] help you until i love you
[41:09] so paul says we have knowledge but
[41:12] listen what he said he said knowledge
[41:13] puffeth up
[41:15] but charity edify it that's literally
[41:17] knowledge puffs
[41:19] charity builds
[41:23] knowledge puffs of bills
[41:27] that which is puffed up is prone to be
[41:29] deflated
[41:32] paul tells the corinthians over and over
[41:33] again you're puffed up
[41:35] you're puffed up we don't want to be
[41:37] like that do we we don't want to be
[41:39] puffed up because if you're puffed up
[41:41] you're going to be deflated pride
[41:42] goes before a fall i've
[41:46] been interested in the story of benjamin
[41:49] franklin in
[41:49] his diplomacy in france because there
[41:52] was a man named john adams who you
[41:53] probably know who went with him
[41:55] or was there with him in france as an
[41:57] ambassador
[41:59] and the french loved franklin and hated
[42:01] adams
[42:03] and john adams was a brilliant man
[42:06] and and probably one of the reasons why
[42:08] we have a country
[42:10] but he was vain he was terribly vain man
[42:14] and he and franklin couldn't stand one
[42:16] another and
[42:18] he was benjamin franklin was a genius
[42:21] but he learned to act humble
[42:23] in fact when he got to france he sent
[42:25] back for a shipment of coonskin caps
[42:29] because that's what they expected him to
[42:32] appear as was a frontiersman
[42:34] and the story goes that franklin had
[42:35] never worn a skin cap
[42:38] in his life but he but he wore one in
[42:41] france every day
[42:43] because that's what they expected to see
[42:46] and when benjamin franklin was very
[42:48] young i think he was 17 years old he'd
[42:50] had a
[42:51] a bitter disagreement as a young printer
[42:54] when even publishing anonymously at one
[42:56] time but
[42:57] he was having a bitter disagreement with
[42:59] a puritan preacher by the name of cotton
[43:01] mather
[43:02] and the old preacher had had
[43:05] they disagreed bitterly but he franklin
[43:08] respected him
[43:10] and he went to his home one time when he
[43:11] was 17 and
[43:13] because he had such respect for him he
[43:14] thought i'm going to learn something
[43:16] from this great man
[43:17] and so he went and they talked in the
[43:19] library and talked about books and
[43:20] things like that and
[43:21] as he was leaving he franklin bumped his
[43:24] head on the doorway
[43:26] and before he did the preacher had
[43:29] hollered out to him stoop
[43:31] stoop and he walks through and
[43:34] bumps his head and ben franklin is uh
[43:40] didn't hear him and didn't realize what
[43:42] he was saying and he turned around and
[43:45] mr mather said well he said you're young
[43:48] he said you have the whole world before
[43:50] you but if you stoop as you go through
[43:52] it
[43:53] you'll avoid a lot of hard thumps
[44:00] and benjamin franklin wrote his his son
[44:03] and told him he said
[44:04] he said that's taught me that if i can
[44:07] be humble around people and treat them
[44:09] right
[44:10] he said then that we can we can have
[44:12] success and
[44:15] godly understanding is not for the
[44:17] purpose of being puffed up
[44:19] this prayer brother brandon prayed was
[44:20] amazing and countdown he says i pray
[44:23] and thank you for giving us good rest in
[44:25] our bodies
[44:26] and for the knowledge that we have of
[44:28] your word
[44:29] see we have knowledge of the word of god
[44:31] don't we
[44:32] we have knowledge this message has given
[44:34] us knowledge of the word
[44:36] he said and the understanding we have of
[44:39] the spirit
[44:40] so we have knowledge of the word
[44:41] understanding of the spirit he said and
[44:44] constantly praying that you'll give us
[44:46] greater understanding so that we might
[44:50] not be a vain puffed up people by
[44:53] but a humble people god give us that
[44:56] kind of understanding
[44:58] so we'll not be a vain puffed up people
[45:00] but a humble people
[45:02] he said in order that the holy spirit
[45:05] might be able to use us that's what i
[45:07] want is that what you want
[45:09] that the holy spirit might be able to
[45:11] use us in
[45:12] and to play to the fulfilling of the
[45:14] word of god
[45:15] and to place us positionally where we
[45:18] need to be
[45:20] at this hour you want to be placed where
[45:23] you need to be
[45:24] be humble have an understanding so
[45:27] you're not vain and puffed up
[45:29] have that kind of understanding he said
[45:31] for we must
[45:32] be at the right place for it to happen
[45:36] he said and we want to be lord
[45:39] that's your desire so paul continues in
[45:42] verse 2 and he says if any man
[45:44] think that he knoweth anything he
[45:47] knoweth nothing yet
[45:49] as he ought to know
[45:54] there's some good stuff in here
[45:57] and so they're asking paul a question
[45:59] that he said the reason you're asking in
[46:01] this way is because you don't know what
[46:02] you ought to know
[46:04] he's not disagreeing with their
[46:05] conclusion but he's disagreeing with the
[46:07] way they applied it
[46:09] now brother branham he said i met a man
[46:12] here some time ago he said
[46:14] billy i just learned a certain greek
[46:15] word i've been on it for five years
[46:18] i like to use greek i really do i like
[46:21] to get down and get into the meanings of
[46:22] things but look what he said
[46:24] he said i've been on it for five years
[46:25] trying to learn the real meaning of this
[46:27] greek word
[46:28] he said oh when i found it it is a
[46:29] blessing i said you've been five years
[46:32] learning one greek word yes
[46:34] i said in that five years by god's grace
[46:36] i've won half a million souls
[46:38] to christ not knowing any greek word
[46:45] he said so it isn't what you know it's
[46:46] who you know
[46:48] to know him as life
[46:51] i think we complicate it too much
[46:53] sometimes we make mysteries out of
[46:55] mysteries
[46:56] i i'm good at that i can i can talk
[46:59] a million times after i should have
[47:01] already shut up
[47:03] and been better off but you see it isn't
[47:05] what you know
[47:06] it's who you know but listen what paul
[47:10] says in verse 3 he said but if any man
[47:11] love
[47:12] god if any man how many love god tonight
[47:16] that's why you're here on a wednesday
[47:17] night you love god you wouldn't be here
[47:18] if you didn't love god
[47:20] i believe that but if any man love god
[47:22] the same is known
[47:24] of him he doesn't say the same
[47:27] knows god but the same is known of god
[47:30] and that implies that you know him
[47:31] because you're known of him
[47:33] he knows you in other words it's one
[47:37] thing for you to know
[47:38] god it's one thing for you to know his
[47:39] word it's another thing for him to know
[47:41] you
[47:43] because even the devil knows the
[47:44] scriptures sure he does he can he can
[47:47] twist them every way
[47:48] but do you know him to know him as life
[47:53] brother brown said and he's told this
[47:55] story multiple times in the message but
[47:56] he said
[47:57] a fellow said to me not long ago he said
[47:58] i was just discussing what we thought
[48:00] about a certain scripture in the bible
[48:02] this fellow was quite a scholar he said
[48:03] well you just don't know your bible
[48:05] but he said i know the author real well
[48:09] i'd like to get up close and personal
[48:10] with the author so i would know
[48:13] i could feel the heartbeat of it i would
[48:15] know how to apply it
[48:17] in real life he said that's the main
[48:20] thing he said if i know him he will take
[48:22] care of the rest of it
[48:23] to know him as life
[48:26] verse 4 paul says has concerning
[48:29] therefore the eating of those things
[48:30] that are offered in sacrifice unto idols
[48:33] we know that an idol is nothing in the
[48:35] world
[48:37] and that there is none other god but one
[48:42] and you can preach a whole sermon on
[48:44] that
[48:46] but what paul is doing he's not giving
[48:48] the idol any credibility
[48:51] right and sometimes we give things too
[48:53] much credibility
[48:55] we when we when we live in a fearful way
[49:00] there's a lot of things that are wrong
[49:01] to do
[49:03] but if you live your life in a fearful
[49:05] way oh i i'm so afraid i'm going to do
[49:07] something that's wrong
[49:09] actually what you do is if you give
[49:11] those things more power than they have
[49:14] just listen to the voice of the holy
[49:16] spirit if we would just listen
[49:17] to the things we know are wrong and not
[49:19] do those things we'd be okay
[49:22] all right and then there's forgiveness
[49:24] if we make a mistake there
[49:26] we have an advocate aren't you glad for
[49:27] that because we do make mistakes
[49:32] there's none other god but one he says
[49:34] now
[49:35] verse five he explains that he said
[49:37] though there be that are called gods
[49:39] whether in heaven or in earth there be
[49:42] god's many and lord's many
[49:44] there are be that are called gods there
[49:45] are many images that are supposed to be
[49:47] representations of deity
[49:49] but these are nothing they're the
[49:52] figments of a man's fancy
[49:55] of his imagination these these images
[49:58] have no
[49:58] corresponding reality
[50:01] just because a man says it's a god
[50:03] doesn't mean it is
[50:06] and we are commanded not to worship
[50:08] those gods but we are not to fear them
[50:10] either
[50:13] right and so verse 6 paul says but to us
[50:17] i think that includes us tonight because
[50:19] brother brown said i preached what paul
[50:21] preached
[50:22] to us there's but one god
[50:26] the father of whom are all things and we
[50:28] in him
[50:29] and one lord jesus christ by whom are
[50:32] all things
[50:33] and we by him one god
[50:37] look at the simplicity and power of this
[50:39] and people make again a mystery out of a
[50:41] mystery
[50:42] and and and find two lords in that
[50:44] somehow but
[50:45] but here he says there's one god one
[50:48] lord jesus christ period
[50:50] one god one lord jesus christ was the
[50:52] fullness the son being the fullness of
[50:54] the godhead bodily
[50:56] it was emmanuel god with us
[50:59] there's one god the father amen
[51:04] whom of whom are all things and we in
[51:06] him and one lord jesus christ by whom
[51:07] are all things and we
[51:09] by him we're seven how be it there's not
[51:12] an every man that knowledge
[51:15] isn't that the truth not everybody
[51:18] understands that
[51:20] and because of that some are weak in
[51:23] their c
[51:24] in their faith and in their conscience
[51:26] he said for some with conscience of the
[51:27] idol and to this hour
[51:29] their conscience of the idol and to this
[51:32] hour eat it as a thing offered unto an
[51:34] idol
[51:35] and their conscience being weak is
[51:37] defiled
[51:40] some eat with consciousness of the idol
[51:42] this is very important
[51:44] because it does correlate to many things
[51:46] today he said
[51:48] that is it's they're fancying it to be
[51:51] something
[51:53] and it makes the meat unlawful to be
[51:54] eaten not because there's any power in
[51:56] the idol
[51:58] but because their conscience is weak
[52:02] and the weak conscience is a
[52:03] consciousness not rightly informed
[52:05] or doesn't have the the required faith
[52:08] it's a weak it's uh
[52:09] that word in the in the original to have
[52:11] if you want to go back to the greek is
[52:12] is a
[52:13] we is a sick conscience it's one that's
[52:16] this weak that's not
[52:18] not strong the idol is
[52:21] nothing but what you make it
[52:25] i could make this an idol and worship it
[52:27] or i could drink from it
[52:30] right i could make my car an idol
[52:33] and spend all my time on it and polish
[52:37] it and take care of it or i could leave
[52:38] it the way it is
[52:41] maybe not take as good care of it as i
[52:43] should but but i can make anything an
[52:45] idol
[52:46] right nothing wrong with polishing your
[52:47] car but you can make anything an idol
[52:51] but if you're not an idol you can polish
[52:52] it all you want to right
[52:56] i had a man at our church at brother ivy
[53:00] said
[53:01] he every time he come to church his car
[53:03] his vehicle was
[53:05] spotless every time and i found out he
[53:08] washed that thing by hand two three
[53:09] times a week
[53:10] and you just got too much time on your
[53:12] hands
[53:15] but it's not an idle unless you make it
[53:16] one
[53:18] right and you can make it one
[53:22] but if you make it an idol then it is an
[53:23] idol i found out
[53:26] and someone had mentioned something like
[53:28] this about this in a sermon one time and
[53:30] i went and found some stuff on it
[53:31] people in different parts of the world
[53:33] worship turtles
[53:36] do you know that that's a turtle idol
[53:41] got the face of a man it's got a beak
[53:43] that's turtle
[53:44] well that way you can see that but it's
[53:46] made out of wood
[53:47] and it's an idol they worship that thing
[53:49] go that next picture if the next
[53:51] picture's on there
[53:52] this is in china that's a turtle
[53:54] carrying money
[53:56] he's got cash on him because that's in
[53:58] the chat in the zoo in
[53:59] in one of the big cities in china
[54:02] there's
[54:03] they actually people will go by and they
[54:05] can't keep people from putting money on
[54:07] the turtles
[54:08] because there's a there's a turtle cult
[54:11] that worships turtles and believes the
[54:13] turtles will bring them good luck
[54:15] so if you get kind of like a wishing
[54:16] well here in the states but they
[54:18] actually put money on turtles
[54:21] now the turtle is nothing right
[54:26] but you can make it an idol because
[54:28] people do now
[54:30] what's interesting about that is no
[54:32] one's going around checking people's
[54:33] home if i posted a picture of a turtle
[54:35] on social media in a cage
[54:37] you wouldn't assume i was worshiping it
[54:42] at least i hope not
[54:48] you wouldn't assume i was worshiping it
[54:50] but it could be an idol
[54:52] in some parts of the world there may be
[54:54] a man who come out of turtle worship
[54:57] and come to believe in christ and he
[54:59] wouldn't want anything to do with
[55:00] turtles
[55:01] and that would be his right
[55:05] but no one's going around checking
[55:06] people's homes to see if they have
[55:07] turtles and calling them pagan
[55:10] brother branham makes a couple
[55:12] statements and and i think most of you
[55:14] know where i'm going here and because
[55:15] it's this time of year and
[55:17] and i'll just deal with it quickly and
[55:19] brother brennan makes a couple
[55:20] statements about christmas trees and
[55:21] white had to be shepherd
[55:24] brother brandon makes this statement
[55:25] which seems pretty severe
[55:27] he says give us the spirit the true
[55:29] spirit of christmas
[55:30] he said when today when pagan ceremonies
[55:32] christmas trees worshiped
[55:34] fiction stories of a man named santa
[55:36] claus and of our easter rabbits
[55:39] he said in the different fashions the
[55:40] commercial world was capitalized on
[55:43] in one place you can find where he talks
[55:45] about easter hats
[55:46] on easter that being a pagan custom too
[55:50] so but he said easter rabbits the
[55:52] different fashions that the commercial
[55:53] world's capitalized on i'm not against
[55:55] hats on easter but that's what he said
[55:58] and not many of us do that so he said
[56:00] that may be laid aside god he said let
[56:02] us enter into christ
[56:04] the word for we ask it in his name as
[56:06] for his glory and that seems
[56:07] pretty obvious brother brown must have
[56:08] been really against christmas trees
[56:12] and then in god's wrapped gift he said
[56:14] then i want to take this time to express
[56:15] to each and every one of you how
[56:16] grateful i am to you for your christmas
[56:18] cards and gifts
[56:19] i've already started getting christmas
[56:21] cards that made my day tonight too
[56:24] it also made me realize that i hadn't
[56:25] thought about christmas cards
[56:29] it's kind of late now but he said the
[56:32] things that was received at our house he
[56:34] said i certainly thank you with all my
[56:35] heart
[56:36] it certainly did us good this morning he
[56:38] said when i got a little boy
[56:39] he said small enough yet to kind of want
[56:41] a christmas tree he said we had it in
[56:43] the room he said in this morning go
[56:44] under there i found several gifts from
[56:46] my church
[56:46] here my friends from around different
[56:48] places that come in laying under the
[56:49] tree
[56:51] and people say well you quit doing that
[56:53] and but you talk to the family and i did
[56:55] recently and
[56:56] to brother george and he said he always
[56:57] had a tree until he died
[57:00] why because they didn't worship it
[57:04] it's nothing does that make sense
[57:07] i know you all know that but but but
[57:09] that's it's nothing
[57:11] now if you worship your tree you've got
[57:13] a problem and you need to get rid of it
[57:17] i'll give you an example it's not
[57:19] christmas we uh
[57:21] my family's game is rook
[57:24] if you've ever heard of the card game
[57:26] rook that's that was our game growing up
[57:28] we loved to play
[57:29] rook i always got beat it at phase 10
[57:32] but i never got
[57:34] at adam's house i always got beat at
[57:35] phase 10 but i couldn't but rook was our
[57:38] game and
[57:38] we got pretty good at it and now we
[57:40] don't play it anymore because we can't
[57:41] agree on the rules
[57:44] but but that was our game growing up
[57:46] when i left home i
[57:48] i went uh it was under a pastor for a
[57:50] while
[57:51] and i started talking about playing rook
[57:53] and how i missed that you know and come
[57:55] to find out he didn't believe in rook
[57:59] and the reason he didn't believe in rook
[58:01] he actually had a valid reason his
[58:02] family gambled on rook
[58:06] and the card game rook was invented by
[58:08] mennonites because they didn't want to
[58:09] use playing cards because it was
[58:10] associated with gambling
[58:12] but this man had his family had had
[58:16] gambled on rook playing cards and so to
[58:19] him that was just as bad as you could
[58:20] get
[58:22] to play rook and to me it was nothing
[58:26] right but now what these people were
[58:28] doing in corinth was the equivalent of
[58:30] me taking a deck of rook cards and going
[58:31] in his house
[58:32] say here we go pastor let's play
[58:36] i know one thing i wouldn't have ever
[58:37] preached for him again
[58:40] right and and the thing is how could i
[58:42] how could i have ever helped him
[58:44] and it may seem silly but it wasn't to
[58:46] him
[58:47] right and i'm not taking up for
[58:49] ignorance but sometimes you just you
[58:51] have to understand where a person comes
[58:52] from
[58:54] let's go to verse eight first
[58:56] corinthians 8 8 he said
[58:58] me commendeth us not to god
[59:01] for neither if we eat are we the better
[59:03] neither if we eat
[59:04] not are we the worst we've got to
[59:07] remember this
[59:10] this was it wasn't an issue but they
[59:12] made it one
[59:15] both the legalists and and people that
[59:18] promote liberty and the gospel both
[59:20] do that they make it an issue sometimes
[59:24] sometimes we make it an issue and we
[59:25] have to be careful about that verse 9
[59:27] but take heed
[59:28] lest by any means this liberty of yours
[59:31] become a stumbling block to them that
[59:33] are weak
[59:35] so your freedom carries with
[59:36] responsibility the an ethics class
[59:38] something you ever go through next
[59:39] ethics class that'll teach you about not
[59:41] yelling fire in a in a crowded theater
[59:44] right that's that's ethics 101 don't
[59:46] yell fire in a crowded theater
[59:51] and we attended an ethics class once and
[59:53] they had a lawyer teaching it
[59:56] which is strange why would you have a
[59:59] lawyer teach an ethics class
[1:00:04] but so but there's responsibility in
[1:00:06] that
[1:00:07] and so paul says someone that is weak it
[1:00:10] could become a stumbling block to them
[1:00:11] what does what does weak mean
[1:00:12] romans 14 and 1 he says him that is weak
[1:00:14] in the faith
[1:00:15] receive you but not to doubtful
[1:00:17] disputations
[1:00:19] doubtful disputations this is
[1:00:20] interesting it doesn't mean
[1:00:23] if he disagrees with you you don't have
[1:00:24] to receive him
[1:00:26] but it says it means don't argue with
[1:00:27] him
[1:00:29] in other words not to the deciding of
[1:00:31] doubts or scruples
[1:00:32] not for the purpose of arguing him out
[1:00:34] of them
[1:00:36] so well you can come to our church but
[1:00:37] first i want to make sure you got all
[1:00:39] the scruples out of you
[1:00:41] all the little things you hold on to
[1:00:42] that aren't right no i believe that the
[1:00:45] preaching of the word will do that
[1:00:48] but it's not my job to argue it out of
[1:00:49] you
[1:00:52] right and usually when you begin to
[1:00:55] argue with somebody it does the reverse
[1:00:57] where if you'd give someone confidence
[1:00:58] and and christian affection
[1:01:01] it would begin to draw those things away
[1:01:04] so paul in that example he mentions
[1:01:06] jewish meats and days
[1:01:07] the strong don't have to observe those
[1:01:10] things but the weak
[1:01:11] do and paul says they're both christians
[1:01:14] some are just weak in the faith
[1:01:17] don't get involved in his arguments just
[1:01:18] receive him as a brother second timothy
[1:01:20] 2 23
[1:01:21] talks about a minister and a
[1:01:23] responsibility of a minister
[1:01:24] he said but foolish and unlearned
[1:01:26] questions avoid
[1:01:28] avoid right and we don't do that well
[1:01:31] enough
[1:01:32] i always wanted to be able to answer a
[1:01:34] question but sometimes you have to avoid
[1:01:36] a question if it's a foolish and
[1:01:38] unlearned question knowing that they do
[1:01:40] gender
[1:01:41] strifes second timothy 2 24 and the
[1:01:44] servant of the lord must not strive
[1:01:47] we say that again the servant of the
[1:01:49] lord must not strive
[1:01:52] i wish i could turn around and preach at
[1:01:53] myself i need a mirror up here
[1:01:56] the servant of the lord must not strive
[1:01:59] but be gentle unto all men apt to teach
[1:02:02] patient brother branham says it this way
[1:02:06] he said the unbelievers can't believe it
[1:02:08] have you ever thought about it like that
[1:02:11] they can't
[1:02:12] believe it they're unbelievers
[1:02:15] it wasn't meant for the unbeliever they
[1:02:17] can't believe it
[1:02:18] so he said now if anybody wants to argue
[1:02:20] about the serpent seat and things he
[1:02:22] said you try to show them they won't
[1:02:23] listen to it
[1:02:24] he said just walk away just leave them
[1:02:27] alone
[1:02:27] see god don't argue neither does his
[1:02:30] children
[1:02:32] so that would be somebody that's weak
[1:02:34] but you just don't argue with them
[1:02:35] let them be in the right atmosphere let
[1:02:37] them hang around and see if they can get
[1:02:38] better
[1:02:39] don't argue with them they have to know
[1:02:40] the truth but don't argue with them
[1:02:43] first corinthians 8 and 10
[1:02:46] for if any man see thee which has
[1:02:48] knowledge said it meet in the idol's
[1:02:50] temple
[1:02:51] we say you got knowledge so you're going
[1:02:54] down into the idols temple
[1:02:56] which they weren't supposed to do eating
[1:02:59] meat
[1:03:00] and and just having a good old time he
[1:03:03] said shall not the conscience of him
[1:03:04] which is weak be emboldened
[1:03:07] to eat those things which are offered to
[1:03:09] idols now
[1:03:11] you know you think of it like this two
[1:03:13] brothers in the church sit down for a
[1:03:14] meal
[1:03:16] one's jew and the other is gentile
[1:03:19] and and somehow the jewish brother finds
[1:03:21] out that the meat has been offered to an
[1:03:23] idol
[1:03:23] his conscience bothers him won't let him
[1:03:26] eat it
[1:03:28] you don't want to do it right the
[1:03:30] gentile brother man
[1:03:31] he's got the truth and said paul's
[1:03:34] taught us about grace
[1:03:36] we've learned about grace man you can
[1:03:38] eat that why won't you try it
[1:03:41] here here have some you know he
[1:03:43] basically
[1:03:44] forces him to do it so he don't want to
[1:03:46] do it
[1:03:47] so he takes it and eats it the other
[1:03:50] brother knows the truth and encourages
[1:03:52] this one to do it and what he does is he
[1:03:53] violates his conscience
[1:03:57] and so paul said then the man will be
[1:03:58] emboldened to violate his conscience
[1:04:00] again
[1:04:02] but next time it might be something that
[1:04:04] actually matters
[1:04:07] right so the irony of the expression is
[1:04:11] is this it's it's that word emboldened
[1:04:15] is a ruinous
[1:04:16] upbuilding he says i can do that too
[1:04:20] i can do that too and he dies
[1:04:23] spiritually from it
[1:04:25] first corinthians 8 11 he said and
[1:04:27] through thy knowledge
[1:04:29] shall the weak brother perish for whom
[1:04:31] christ died
[1:04:33] because you're exercising your freedom
[1:04:34] is it okay with you for your brother
[1:04:36] who's weak to perish you're
[1:04:40] right but you tried to get this other
[1:04:42] brother to be like you and you ruined
[1:04:44] him
[1:04:46] right and we could do that
[1:04:50] i could in attempting i love to tell
[1:04:53] people
[1:04:54] about preaching i love to talk about it
[1:04:55] i love to talk about it i could i could
[1:04:58] influence brother allen in such a way
[1:05:00] preaching wise that i tried to
[1:05:02] do things like i do it until i ruined
[1:05:04] him
[1:05:06] and that would be a shame right you but
[1:05:09] you could do that
[1:05:10] as brothers and sisters together
[1:05:12] somebody don't they don't want to
[1:05:13] participate in something they don't want
[1:05:14] to partake in something
[1:05:15] leave them alone let them let them be
[1:05:18] who they are
[1:05:20] and you be who you are and and so you
[1:05:24] may have an understanding of
[1:05:25] better than that but just just live your
[1:05:27] life now you could sit there all day and
[1:05:30] and it never bothered you but he might
[1:05:32] end up worshiping that idol where he
[1:05:33] eats meat
[1:05:37] a good example is things we do on
[1:05:39] sundays
[1:05:41] i don't mow my grass on sundays and if
[1:05:44] you do that's
[1:05:45] that's up to you i i don't do that i
[1:05:47] don't fish on sundays
[1:05:49] unless i'm way away from civilization
[1:05:53] but then fishing is a lot harder to give
[1:05:55] up than the mowing
[1:05:58] and it's not because i esteem one day
[1:06:00] above the other but i don't want to
[1:06:02] someone else to take the opportunity to
[1:06:03] start
[1:06:04] staying home and mowing their lawn
[1:06:06] instead of coming to church
[1:06:08] because i went to church you know how
[1:06:10] easy it would be
[1:06:11] you know sometimes on a sunday it would
[1:06:13] be easy for me to
[1:06:14] sip up here to mama springs after church
[1:06:17] and
[1:06:17] stand there and fish and there wouldn't
[1:06:19] be anything wrong with it for me
[1:06:21] i may get in trouble for saying that but
[1:06:24] i've been to church
[1:06:25] i'm not having another service but
[1:06:27] somebody sees me out there and said well
[1:06:28] brother ben skipped church
[1:06:30] today he didn't know i just preached a
[1:06:32] short sermon and ran up there and
[1:06:36] huh so it's so it's public now it
[1:06:39] it's you know it's something if it's
[1:06:40] something that the public doesn't see it
[1:06:42] does make a difference you're not trying
[1:06:44] to hide anything
[1:06:45] but you got to watch what you do i found
[1:06:48] out living in hardy
[1:06:49] or near hardy arkansas the public sees
[1:06:51] everything
[1:06:58] but i hope i'm not boring you tonight i
[1:07:01] i have to take this slower we won't
[1:07:03] understand it i won't i won't get it if
[1:07:05] we don't take it so so you all bear with
[1:07:06] me
[1:07:08] paul gives a practical example in
[1:07:10] chapter 10 and he
[1:07:11] he says whatever sold in the markets eat
[1:07:13] that don't ask
[1:07:16] right he said don't ask any questions
[1:07:19] but if you know it's been offered to an
[1:07:20] idol don't
[1:07:21] eat it he says if he says that if you're
[1:07:24] in public if you're at someone's house
[1:07:26] you know something's been offered to an
[1:07:27] idol don't partake of it
[1:07:29] don't deliberately do things that'll
[1:07:31] offend people that you know is going to
[1:07:33] offend people
[1:07:36] and god help us with that now
[1:07:39] i think in this time that we live in we
[1:07:40] should be more careful the way we live
[1:07:42] than we've ever been
[1:07:44] and you can't avoid offending everybody
[1:07:46] some people just get offended
[1:07:48] right it's just going to get offended
[1:07:50] it's just that's just the way it is
[1:07:53] and so you can't you just have to live
[1:07:54] your life but if there's something
[1:07:56] you're deliberately doing to
[1:07:57] that you know is going to offend
[1:07:59] somebody it can be wrong now
[1:08:02] brother brown says now if there's a
[1:08:03] question and here's why it's wrong
[1:08:05] because it violates their conscience
[1:08:06] brother brown said if there's a question
[1:08:08] he said men come and say do you think
[1:08:09] it's wrong to smoke he said what are you
[1:08:12] asking about it for
[1:08:13] and we know smoking is wrong right we
[1:08:16] know smoking is wrong
[1:08:17] sometimes we assume people know
[1:08:19] something's wrong and that they really
[1:08:20] don't
[1:08:21] but we know smoking is wrong they asked
[1:08:24] me i went to the doctor if i smoked
[1:08:26] and she lady knew i was a pastor knew
[1:08:28] who i was and i
[1:08:30] said no i i don't smoke she said well i
[1:08:32] have to ask you never know
[1:08:36] and and so but brother branham says do
[1:08:38] you think it's wrong to smoke what are
[1:08:39] you asking about it for us if a question
[1:08:41] in your mind leave it alone
[1:08:43] he said for anything you don't do by
[1:08:45] faith is sin
[1:08:48] if you can't do it and feel good about
[1:08:49] it don't do it
[1:08:51] right and i think we all need to tune in
[1:08:53] a little bit
[1:08:55] right you know the old radios i used to
[1:08:56] have a shortwave radio
[1:08:58] and you'd tune that thing but then you'd
[1:09:00] have to get all the way
[1:09:01] to the right channel you know and get it
[1:09:03] to the right thing you pick up the bbc
[1:09:05] or something overseas
[1:09:06] and i'd sit there and listen to it at
[1:09:08] night because we didn't have tv
[1:09:10] so i listened to shortwave radio and
[1:09:13] i i always loved doing that but you had
[1:09:15] to get it just right you turned it on
[1:09:16] back and forth get it just right
[1:09:18] i think we need to tune into god like
[1:09:20] that we need to there's a signal coming
[1:09:23] in but we need to tune in
[1:09:24] and we've talked about that recently
[1:09:26] where we need to
[1:09:27] be sensitive when god says no let's just
[1:09:30] stop
[1:09:32] if god says do something then we need to
[1:09:34] be sensitive to that as well
[1:09:36] i need to be more sensitive to that
[1:09:39] he said but anything you don't do by
[1:09:40] faith is sin he said that's right got to
[1:09:42] be by faith
[1:09:43] so how can you smoke and have faith
[1:09:47] he said see it's right in your own
[1:09:49] conscience shows that you're wrong
[1:09:52] so if it's uncertain you better leave it
[1:09:54] alone
[1:09:55] because that might be the one thing that
[1:09:58] keeps you out of the kingdom of god
[1:10:03] first corinthians 8 12 but when you sin
[1:10:05] so against the brethren
[1:10:07] and wound their weak conscience you sin
[1:10:08] against christ
[1:10:11] that's something to think about isn't it
[1:10:14] there are some things that you do that
[1:10:15] are more harmful to others than
[1:10:17] some of the examples that we've used
[1:10:20] drinking alcohol is one of them
[1:10:22] some people don't think there's anything
[1:10:23] wrong with that you can't do that
[1:10:26] without either harming yourself or
[1:10:28] somebody else
[1:10:30] right and people that believe that they
[1:10:31] can or fooling themselves
[1:10:34] say well i just have one glass of wine a
[1:10:36] night you're fooling yourself
[1:10:39] i read a story about a man who's
[1:10:42] crossing a bridge and there's a man
[1:10:43] heavier than him and the bridge
[1:10:44] will hold him he's 150 pounds i don't
[1:10:47] know if there's a man here that's 150
[1:10:49] pounds or not but
[1:10:51] without shaking his head but
[1:10:55] here was a man like me on the bridge
[1:10:58] or on the edge and this man's crossing
[1:11:01] the bridge and he looks at that man he
[1:11:02] says come on come on
[1:11:04] this bridge i've walked over it all my
[1:11:05] life it's it's good see i can jump up
[1:11:08] and down on it i can
[1:11:09] it's good it's solid but it'll only hold
[1:11:12] 200 pounds
[1:11:14] and 200 pounds won't hold me
[1:11:17] so if this other man is coming on and
[1:11:19] and finally he convinces him he don't
[1:11:21] he don't like it but he finally
[1:11:23] convinces him to do it and the thing
[1:11:25] crashes
[1:11:26] he dies whose fault is it
[1:11:31] the guy who kept but see what he didn't
[1:11:34] he didn't take into consideration
[1:11:36] the difference in weight right
[1:11:40] and you've got to take into
[1:11:41] consideration that somebody else's
[1:11:42] conscience is different from mine
[1:11:46] that's the hardest part about being in a
[1:11:48] church but it's one of the best things
[1:11:49] about being in a church
[1:11:50] if you're part of a body of people you
[1:11:52] begin to learn other people
[1:11:54] and you have to you have to keep
[1:11:56] yourself crucify yourself a little bit
[1:11:59] to work with other people it'd be easy
[1:12:02] to sit by yourself and just never work
[1:12:03] with anybody
[1:12:05] but if you got to be a part of a group
[1:12:07] of a church a group of people
[1:12:09] and i'll say this you are part of a
[1:12:11] church somewhere
[1:12:13] you may not feel like it but you're part
[1:12:14] of the body of christ
[1:12:16] so you're part of the church whether you
[1:12:17] like to be or not you may be a part that
[1:12:20] doesn't work anymore
[1:12:23] but you're part of the church we'd
[1:12:26] rather have you working
[1:12:29] to help the body you see so i don't want
[1:12:32] to convince anybody to cross the bridge
[1:12:34] i'm crossing
[1:12:35] not unless i have scripture for it
[1:12:39] there's a bridge we can cross and i have
[1:12:40] scripture for that
[1:12:42] i can have the message of the hour i can
[1:12:44] stand on a solid foundation
[1:12:46] but i don't want anybody to cross a
[1:12:48] bridge that i've gotten over but other
[1:12:51] people couldn't go
[1:12:53] so paul says in verse 13 wherefore if me
[1:12:55] make my brother to offend
[1:12:58] listen to the power of this statement
[1:13:00] paul makes a flat out statement that's
[1:13:02] amazing he says if meat
[1:13:04] make my brother to offend now he doesn't
[1:13:05] say if me defends my brother
[1:13:08] but if meat makes my brother offend if
[1:13:11] what i'm doing
[1:13:12] causes somebody else to fall
[1:13:15] i will eat no flesh while the world
[1:13:17] standeth
[1:13:19] lest i make my brother to offend
[1:13:22] the paul says you're right but you're
[1:13:24] wrong
[1:13:25] you can do it you can go ahead and do it
[1:13:28] but remember
[1:13:29] if you call your brother to come with
[1:13:31] you if you try to force him to do it you
[1:13:34] better be careful
[1:13:38] the corinthian church was very
[1:13:39] interested in making everybody else like
[1:13:41] them and what we need to do is make
[1:13:42] everybody else like christ
[1:13:44] make ourselves like christ and be an
[1:13:46] imitator of christ
[1:13:48] when you say you go to church brother
[1:13:50] brown says and you do good things that's
[1:13:51] fine
[1:13:53] when you live your life to yourself you
[1:13:55] have an eternal life
[1:14:00] how do we square that with people just
[1:14:02] refusing to go to church and i that's
[1:14:03] none of you all because you're here on a
[1:14:05] wednesday night
[1:14:06] but if you just refuse to go to church
[1:14:08] how do you square that living for others
[1:14:11] you say that you go to church though and
[1:14:13] you do good things that's fine but when
[1:14:15] you live your life to yourself
[1:14:17] you have an eternal life eternal life is
[1:14:19] living
[1:14:20] for others and he said it proved it when
[1:14:24] it come in the lamb of god
[1:14:26] he lived and had eternal life because he
[1:14:28] did not live for himself
[1:14:29] he lived for others and you receive
[1:14:32] eternal life by receiving that day
[1:14:34] how simple is that there's the plan of
[1:14:37] salvation you receive eternal life
[1:14:39] by receiving that day that day on
[1:14:41] calvary you don't live for yourself no
[1:14:43] more
[1:14:44] you live for others
[1:14:47] musicians go ahead and come a little boy
[1:14:51] asked his mother says what is a
[1:14:52] christian
[1:14:55] his mother started to tell him how a
[1:14:56] person becomes a christian and
[1:14:58] what kind of a life that christian had
[1:15:00] they would be like christ and
[1:15:02] they would act in a certain way and she
[1:15:03] as she began to tell him give him a long
[1:15:05] explanation
[1:15:07] she gets done talking to him and the
[1:15:10] little boy said
[1:15:11] mama have i ever seen a christian
[1:15:15] i wonder how she felt
[1:15:18] have i ever seen a christian
[1:15:21] i wonder sometimes if if we were accused
[1:15:24] in the court of law
[1:15:25] being a christian would we be found
[1:15:27] guilty
[1:15:28] a real christian how do i become that by
[1:15:31] the word
[1:15:33] by surrendering your life to the word
[1:15:37] listen these wednesday nights mean a lot
[1:15:38] more than we think they do
[1:15:41] because this is eternal this this will
[1:15:43] fit in every age that's ever been
[1:15:45] it's eternal it'll always be if the
[1:15:48] lord cherished for 20 years for 40 years
[1:15:50] if it's tomorrow
[1:15:51] god willing that it would be it'll still
[1:15:54] be good
[1:15:56] make you more like him that's what i
[1:15:59] want to be i want to look in that mirror
[1:16:00] until i can say mama that's me
[1:16:04] until if i was talking to my child now i
[1:16:07] didn't have to explain what a christian
[1:16:08] was
[1:16:09] i could show them what a christian was
[1:16:12] isn't that what you want to do it's not
[1:16:13] your desire
[1:16:14] let's bow our heads together
[1:16:17] heavenly father i'm going to
[1:16:21] ask you today myself
[1:16:25] lord that you would just come down make
