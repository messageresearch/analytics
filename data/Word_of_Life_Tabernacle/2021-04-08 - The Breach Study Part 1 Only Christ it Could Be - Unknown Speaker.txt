together heavenly father we thank you for the opportunity to come to your house again tonight on a wednesday night just to receive the blessings that we know are prepared for us on this night and we thank you or we're human and we make mistakes but we're so thankful that you make no mistakes and you're able or to come and and and just give us exactly what we have need of tonight i pray you'd grant that lord and i pray that you'd move in every life i pray that you'd speak through your word we know that you're here for you promised that you would be here and we're standing on that word tonight we're believing that you're going to do something for us you're going to speak directly to whatever situation that we're going through i pray you'd move me out of the way and speak to us tonight from your word we ask it in jesus name amen amen you love the lord tonight man i apologize i know i was a little bit late coming out i got talking and and wasn't prepared to come out but uh the lord's got everything in in his hands doesn't he amen that's one thing you can do to make me late is get me to talk i want you to turn with me revelations chapter 5 and verse 1. i embarrass my wife so bad when i do that i've only done that two or three times in all the years that i've been preaching and she reminds me on occasion of those two or three times revelations chapter 5 and verse 1 isn't it good to be in the house of the lord then we have some good services on saturday and sunday amen i enjoyed that so much and and then you know on wednesday nights it seems like that the devil's been fighting us with weather and it looked like we were gonna have some bad weather again and two times in a row when we're gonna have bad weather it's just kind of bypassed us or went through before church time and i'm so thankful for that i believe that that means that god meant for you to be here and me to be here and us to have church so we're going to hear from the word tonight because we believe that the word is is always good and and god's got something for us revelations chapter 5 and verse 1 and i saw in the right hand of him that said on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals and i saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who was worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in heaven nor on earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look there on and i wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look thereon and one of the elders saith unto me weep not behold the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david have prevailed to open the book and loose the seven seals thereof and we heard about that how he prevailed on sunday amen he prevailed he fought the battle and he won amen he prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof and i be held and low in the midst of i beheld and low in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders to the lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent forth into all the earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that set upon the throne i pray the lord would add his blessing to the word you may be seated i'm going to begin tonight it doesn't mean i'll be doing it every wednesday night but from time to time until we're through it i'm going to begin studying on the message called the breach between the seven church ages and seven seals and i want to eventually get to the seven seals and uh but this is maybe a little bit different than what we would normally do on a wednesday night but we've been in revival and we we've we've i'm so happy to have a revival in our hearts aren't you glad to have a revival in your heart but we're going to just kind of study the message tonight and and look at it in maybe a little bit different way than what we're used to i want to look at it in its context and the reason my reason for doing this is because i've found that myself that i get i take brother branham out of context sometimes okay and that's an admission now you can take that and run with it and call me a false teacher or whatever but we do that and it's not always bad okay because sometimes you'll use a quote that's a good quote but it's not really the way that he intended to do it for it to be used it's taken out of context and you all know some of you are old enough to remember quote books when we had quote books and you could take a quote book and say you had a quote book on christmas and you could take a quote book anti-christmas and another quote book christmas and and take them in and you could just use those quotes and it would be all good quotes one way or the other just taken out of context right and and very few people are able to get past their own biases far enough to just present it and so we want to always present the whole council of god and that's why i try to come to you as a pastor i can't always be evangelistic i can't always be a teacher i have to be all of those things but i can't always be just one of those things right and so i have a responsibility to declare to you the whole counsel of god and in doing that i one of the ways that i've done it over the years is just to take brother branham's message and go through a sermon and read to you out of that sermon although we don't read the whole thing but most of it and give you the context of why brother branham saying those things and and brother random will take what seems like a red herring many times in those sermons and i encourage you to listen to the tape because brother random will take what seems to be a side road and talk about something that's not with the sermon with his text but if you'll wait for it you'll find it does apply and so those things are important too and a lot of times those things get get left out there's a lot of times that and we don't want to hear about nuance we don't want to hear about uh that we want to get right straight to the point right but the truth is the point isn't always sometimes what's around it matters and so we want to make sure we get all of it now i know that the question would be asked and i want to deal with this and just talk to you about this and i won't be doing this again but just to kind of as we start this why not just play the tape well brother branham taught us how to run our services and i think he did a good job with that and abstinent i don't have a district president or somewhere telling me how what to do and how to run the services i look at what brother branham said about that and in church order brother branham talks about how pastors to be in his study and getting quiet and i could i got really quiet tonight i had plenty of time in the study and but he talks about that and and before he comes out to preach and then in church order he says come out greet his audience that's what i've done to you turn to his book and say tonight we're reading from the bible afterward he makes it up we're reading from the bible and it's a good thing sometimes if you say in respect to the word of god let's stand to our feet while we read the word he said from eight to about a quarter till nine and that would be if the server started at 7 30. so he said just somewhere between 30 and 45 minutes now this is after you've read the scripture i'm giving myself plenty of time here right so he says from 30 between 30 and 45 minutes lay that word in there just as the holy ghost gives it to you right and so he says see just like that just place it right in there the way he says do it under the anointing and so for me i'll just take his word on that he never told me anything different how to how to run a church service and and the scripture is silent on that but we know that in the scripture it says preach the word right be instant in season and out of season so that's an authority that we have and jesus told us to preach the gospel now uh you know you say well brother branham was just saying that he didn't really believe that well what can we believe about what brother branham says brother brown uses this argument he said if i don't believe in going to church why do i have church i think i could use that same argument if brother branham didn't believe in preachers why did he have one in his own church so if i don't believe in going to church why do i have church so he did believe in it now and but it's not just the minister or the pastor that has something to say every one of us has something to say something that we need to say does that make sense that no one else can say for us i have to say peter had to say thou art the christ the son of the living god peter had to say that he was the only one who could say that that way in order to receive the blessing from that you're the only one that can say i want to be baptized i want to give my heart to christ i repent of my sins you have to say that right and brother branham said how can a man come along and say the holy man is the pope the holy man is the bishop he said the holy man is christ the holy spirit in us he said how can you say the laity has no word to say now we're taking that even a step further and say well the preacher doesn't have anything to say but he said how can you say the laity has no word to say each one of you has something to say each one of you has got a work to do each one of you has got to carry a message if you can't do that with words then do it the way you live isn't that right i have been encouraged in in studying the sermons this way gives us the opportunity to compare with scripture and also with things brother branham says in other places especially after the opening of the seals i'm i've been encouraged lately to see revival fire especially among the young people i'm so encouraged by that i like to see the the move of the spirit of the lord i i enjoy that so much we need that atmosphere we need that presence of god and yet at the same time we've got to keep our balance in the word because feelings will come and go and and again i fully support every feeling that we have i wish we every service we had a jericho march around the church and just shouted and hollered and and and because i believe the words worth that i i believe jesus is worthy of our praise and i believe the word is is good and and we should rejoice in the word but feelings will come and go sometimes you won't feel like shouting sometimes you won't feel like speaking in tongues sometimes you won't hardly be in the spirit at all but the word is still true aren't you glad of that the word is true when you're at home and you've had a spat with your wife or your husband whatever that it is the word is true when you make a mistake when something goes wrong the word is still true and and so we want to make sure we stay with the word and and believe all that the word says and so brother branham says this this is the last quote that i'll read before we get into this but brother branham says there's one side that's highly intellectual cold and indifferent they deny everything there he said and the others get on the other side on the other side with a radical bunch of an emotion and deny the word so it's okay to have all the emotion just stay with the word too right don't don't leave the word with your emotion but the real true church he said stays right in the middle of the road he said now if you notice it's got the bible knowledge of what god said and spiritual enough to be warm in its heart isn't that what you want don't you want to be warm in your heart amen because if you're not all the preaching and teaching in the world couldn't make it work now there's kind of give you a little background on the breach brother random uses the word breach quite often in the message and it's the act in webster's dictionary in 1828 if you ever want a good definition go back to webster 1828 because definitions have changed over time but that original webster's dictionary was a great dictionary in the english language and he used a lot of biblical terms and especially for the king james version it works very well but the word breach is the act of breaking a state of being broken a rupture a break or a gap it's the gap between the ages and the seals the breach but it also speaks of redemption it's beautiful if you think about it because there was a breach between god and man a gap and somebody the lamb had to step into that gap and when he steps out to take the book and he's he's stepping into that gap he's bridging the gap that's what brings us back to god see redemption couldn't stop at the cross it had to be completed redemption had to be completed and tonight we're living in the time of the fullness of redemption during his claiming work and so and so that's the hour that we live in only christ could stand in that breach and make up that gap amen no brother branham preaches five sermons from watch night 1960 through june 1961 dealing with that gap or that breach and that's revelation chapter four uh parts one two and three and then he preached revelation chapter five one and two you'll find that when he preaches revelation chapter five which is the same material or the same scripture he uses in the breach he's caught up in something and that was that deity spirit and so brother brahma is dealing with that in revelation chapter five one and two i think the message used to be called a bruised serpent but it now it's called revelation chapter five one and two now he's dealing with that controversy that's going on i'm glad that he did he then preached 70th week of daniel in august 1961. he then preached is this the sign of the in sir in december 30th 1962 which brother random references over and over and over again is one of the major turning points in his ministry was is this the sign of the in sir which sometimes he'll call what time is it sirs now in in the breach we won't read the first few paragraphs but if you get into that and i'm not going to keep you very long tonight because i know you're sitting here thinking man if he's going to read the breach i'm not going to do that tonight but i'm just going we're just going to barely dip our toe in the water now when brother branham preaches the breach he starts talking about he tells a story about the sword coming in his hand you remember the story and what that what when that happened it was god's answer to brother branham's concern about these things that he he understood from is this the sign of the answer so he references that sermon and he he says it could be one of two things it could be my death it could be the coming of this seventh angel's ministry and we found out what it was now with the benefit of hindsight we can look at that and see what it was he's still with me tonight so it was god's answer to his concern now and so the the sword in the hand was the word of god now it had to be held with a strong hand of faith so brother branham reads the text that i wrote read to you tonight and then in 1963 on march 17th that evening i remember that morning he's preached crisis he's preached um hit god hidden in simplicity uh and so we we know that he's preparing them for something and then that night he preaches the breach now he says this seventh seal book is revealed at the time of the seven thunders of revelation 10. now so much of what we believe in the message comes from these statements in the first part of the message to breach a prophet when he says something it means something so he says the seven seal book is revealed at the time of the seven thunders of revelation 10. he immediately ties the two together he said now if you're marking it down let's turn to revelation 10 just a moment so you get an understanding before we get into it now this is at the end time and he reads revelation 10 1 and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with the cloud a rainbow was upon his head he said if you notice that's christ because he in the old testament was called the angel of the covenant and he is directly coming to the jews now for the church's finish he said and his face was as it were the sun and his feet as pillars of fire he said you remember that angel in revelation 1 the same thing he said angel is a messenger and he's the messenger to israel the church has been raptured he said see now or fixing to be raptured but the realm corrects himself the church is fixing to be raptured he said he comes for his church so i was taught growing up that this was the third coming of christ but that's not what brother branham says it says the church is fixing to be raptured now watch revelation 10 2 and he had in his hand a little book open now it's one of the most important things that we believe he had in his hand a little book open he said now here it was closed here and sealed and here it's open and so he's from revelation 5 to revelation 10 something happened all right it was closed here and sealed here it's open now both those it's closed and then opened during the ministry during the sounding and we'll get to a little bit later of that seventh angel's message it's closed and open during the sounding of the seventh angel's message if it's closed and then open then all seven seals have to be revealed right or else you've got the sounding of the message not over and brother branham has to come back that's right there's no way because it's either open or it's not i believe it's open tonight and that bible become a new book like he told us amen he said so here it's open it's been opened he said since the time of that ceiling we're getting into tonight now the book is open a little book in his hand it was open he said oh how the sun is pillar she said wait just a minute let me start back here and read and he goes back he said he had his hand a little book open he said his right foot upon the sea his left foot on the earth and he cried with a loud voice as when a lion roars roareth now he said we know he is the lion of the tribe of judah over here he's the lamb so he's pointing out something else first he says over here it's closed over here it's open over here he's the lamb but here he's the lion amen amen oh church we're getting awful close brother brown says in sermons that we're getting close somewhere he changes from lamb to lion during this time right of the sounding of the seventh angel's message now he said when he cried seven thunders uttered their voices he's reading the scripture now john was commissioned to write what he saw so the apostle and prophet picked up his pen to write it and when the seven thunders were out of their voices i was about to write i heard a voice from heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered and write them not he said now that's what we don't know that's yet to be revealed now remember this is sunday night it's about to be revealed right he said that's what we don't know that's yet to be revealed it's not in the holy script what them thunders say now i have to diverge a little bit and i told you we'd be comparing some things that brother branham said later with this because we need to understand that if it's yet to be revealed at that time was it revealed during his ministry and brother branham i think says that pretty emphatically in the fourth seal he tells us this he said that's the way the church ages and seals and all the rest of it when anybody thinks he has those seven thunders if it don't compare with the rest of the word there is something wrong so those seven thunders have to compare with the word even though he said it's not a holy script but he said it has to compare with the word he said it's got to come thus saith the lord for this is the book you've heard it said this is brother branham's quote book right it's the bible this is the book this is the revelation of jesus christ in its entirety right so the thunders have to come from they have to match up with that now in the unveiling of god brother branham talks about that and someone had come to him said brother branham you would have the authority with your ministry to come and write another bible and brother branham says he talks about that and he said it may be that i had the authority but it would be wrong he talked about that he said because you can't add to or take away and then he says this he said it's all revealed in there it's all revealed in there and the seven seals opened up the revelation of what that was right the seven seals opened up the revelation of what that's that was he said that's what it was well that's pretty simple isn't it brother brown says that's what it was see it's still in the word see you can't get out of that word he said it won't leave the word and god's spirit will never leave that word it'll stay right with the word blinding some you say well if it's there why didn't everybody see it because it blinds some but there's a people that were meant to see it it'll stay right with the word blinding some and open the eyes of others it'll always do that now later in 1964 in questions and answers brother random has asked the question of the seven thunders which equals seven mysteries already been revealed were they revealed in the seven seals but not yet known to us as the thunders he said no they were known to us now most people didn't know most of the people brother preached it to didn't understand this but he said they were revealed in the seven fields that's what the thunders was about they was to reveal the seven thunders that had uttered their voices and no one could make out what it was john knew what it was but he was forbidden to write it now that's what it was about they was revealed in the seven steels so in 1964 the seven thunders were revealed in 1964 we knew what the thunders were so if someone comes and tells you that the thunders are something else and we had a doctrine in the message for a while the thunders were the virtues that's not what brother branham said and it's not as if brother branham got to heaven and then said oh man i meant to say that the thunders were the virtues and i just forgot right it's not as if he got up there well i'll wait on brother so and so he'll come straighten it out right he didn't do that that's not how god works but the seventh angel when paul left the scene he said i've i've not failed to declare to you the whole council of god and when brother branham left the scene he told us that we had the perfect interpretation i believe it's the way he put it of the scriptures and so it was there it didn't mean that brother brown never made a mistake or there was never any any human error as far as the ways spoke or anything like that but it meant we had the word that supernatural vindication had come to show us that this was true amen amen now the seven thunders had already been revealed he said he said but the seventh angel now watch in the days of his sounding and again this is from questions and answers 1964. he said but the seventh angel in the days of his sounding in the days of his sounding right the seven mysteries of the seven thunders would be revealed and the seventh angel is a messenger of the seventh church age and if the seventh angel is sounded the mysteries and the thunders have to be revealed that's that's the only way that i can see it now revelation 10 5 and 6 says the angel which i saw stand upon the scene upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever and created heaven and the things that there are in the earth and the things that there and are in the sea and the things which are therein there should be time no longer and brother brahman says watch here is a verse i want to get to why because it pertained to his ministry revelation 10 7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he has declared to his servants the prophets but but is a conjunction huh so we're saying these things will be sealed up and the angels stood up and said there should be time no longer but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound during the days of his sounding is the way brother brandon put it the mystery of god should be finished as he has declared his servants the prophets now brother brown said see the mystery of this seven seal book will be revealed at the soundings back to the breach again will be revealed at the sounding of the seventh church angel's message he said brother ben this is elementary but you know it's not elementary to everybody everybody's got to learn it once right and i believe that even a child shouldn't have to err in these things now he says brother brahm says the seventh angel begins to sound begins to sound and there he said is the messages wrote out there and we got it in tape and book form i mean that's that's a prophet right there he's identifying the seventh angel sounding as the message and people tell you what you can only listen to 1963 after the seals now he said there is the messages already in tape and book form prior to the seals being opened right the seven things you have begun to sound right or we just have to throw away the church ages and the and serpent seed and all those things brother branham includes that in the opening of the word now look he says we got it in tape and book form he said now at the beginning of the sounding of the message the mystery of god should be finished see at that time he said now we will notice the book of the mystery of god is not revealed until the seventh angel's message is sounded and you can go to anointed ones at the end time i won't read at the same time but he tells us he said not when he starts on but when he begins to declare his message he talked about how the first poll was healing second paul was prophesying third poll was the opening of the word or the mysteries revealed and that's pretty simple isn't it he said now this is on the breach again now these points will be important in the seals i'm sure he says because it must every bit tie together if it doesn't tie together it's just not true right and we have to remember that now just because we can't make it tie together don't mean we throw it out but if it if it's absolutely foreign to everything else in the scripture and in the message it's just not true now it's wrote mysterious or at least the way we understand it is not true he said it's wrote mysterious because no man nowhere knows it god alone jesus christ see but now but it is a book a mysterious book it's the book of redemption we'll get into that in a little while he said now we know that this book of redemption will not be thoroughly understood do you realize how good we've got it i wonder if we realize how good we've got it this book of redemption will not be thoroughly understood it's been probed at all through six church ages and people don't realize it that some of the simple doctrines of this message that we take so for granted that i can take my girls and i don't have to try to sit there and and hedge about where to show them how to be baptized my daughter come to me the other day and they want to be baptized on sunday you couldn't make your daddy happier than that but see there's a reason why we pulled that baptistry out praise the lord maybe it'd be the young ones maybe they'll start the revival going but we said we know this book of redemption will not be thoroughly understood but now we understand things just simple as water baptism i can show her in the book of acts where it says be baptized repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ that's simple but the denominations almost every one of them got it wrong hundreds of denominations all got it wrong we take that for granted just being able to believe what the bible said someone told me earlier was talking about how that uh pentecost will stand there and say that tongues is the evidence of the holy ghost and we can show them and say it's not in the scripture but almost all pentecostal denominations old line pentecostals teach that but it's not scriptural why can we say that because a prophet come and declared it to us amen realize how good we we've got it it's probed at the six church ages but see we don't have to probe at it now right we're not i'm not taking this and and trying to find out where it is we know what it is right we may overcomplicate it but we know what it says i'm so glad for the message of the hour because it's not a man it's not about a man it's not about even a prophet it's about god wanting to get us a message and so he chose a messenger before time began and he chose the people to receive that message that's us and whoever else will receive he said who else can receive it whoever will receive it that's who's called to it amen i hope i don't bore you tonight but this just means so much to me he said he winds up all the loose ends that those fellows probed at so he didn't leave the thunders as a loose end right he can't have or he didn't or he failed in his ministry he can't leave the part of the seals loose right he can't leave part of of what we believe just hanging out there but we've got what we need to make it in a rapture see he didn't need me to come and tie up the loose ends he tied up the loose hands that's right he didn't need anybody else to top the loose fence he tied up the loose hands and now what we have to do but he said well then why do you bother doing this was because he told us study this take it and break it down he told us to do that amen i'm so thankful we can do it now you don't have to take again my word for it but a prophet's already spoken no it was vindicated now he says it's probed at through six church ages so we don't have to go and say well maybe the it could be this or maybe the thunders or the virtues maybe brother bran was coming back i don't have to do that anymore if i had to do that if i got to worry about that i might as well go back into denominational ages if it can be just interpreted any way i want to that's the way they were with the with the bible however you wanted to interpret it you build a denomination on it that's the way that people do with the message however they want to interpret it build a nomination on it i don't have the authority to do that god said god signified as the book of revelation said we've been talking about angels he said god signified it by his angel to his servant john god signified by an angel in our day what was supposed to be in the word that would come and i'm so glad for it so all those loose ends he said and the mysteries come down from god as the word of god and reveals the entire revelation of god he said then the godhead and everything else is settled amen all the mysteries serpency whatever more is to be revealed brother branham talks about and is this the sign of the answer he goes through those mysteries he talks about grace straightened out not disgrace aren't you glad to know about grace no such thing as an eternal burning hell the baptism of the holy ghost without sensation he said but the life of christ coming back on the believer making you do the works of god baptism in the name of jesus christ the pillar of fire returning back he uses all those as mysteries and he said there were more he said now you see back to the breach he said you see i'm just not making that up he said it's thus saith the lord amen i'll read it to you right out of the book the sounding of the seventh angel's message the mystery of god should be finished has been declared by its holy prophets that's the prophets who has wrote the word at the sounding of the seventh church age the last church age all the loose sins how many of them all of them all the lucians and the law and through the church ages has been probed at will be wound up together now i went and looked a few times that this term loose ends and it doesn't it's a commonly used term but it comes it's a nautical term it comes from the idea of when a ship would be just about ready to go out to sea there would only be one thing left to do everything's put away all the gunpowder is packed all the stores are packed away i mean in the days with sailing ships the captain of the ship would have the sailors go around and tie up the loose ends any of the rigging anything that needed to be tied up he tied it up right he said now is the time to tie up to loose ends we're living in the day when the captain of the ship commissioned a prophet to tie up the loose ends you know what happened next the boat left it was the last thing amen hallelujah and so i put that on there go to that next that next slide instead of a sailor needed to prepare his boat for departure he has many things to do one of the minor details is making sure to tie any untied strings on board the ship it was the last thing they did before leaving the harbor amen we're seeing it church we've seen it the loose ends were tied up now as brother branham said we're the stabilizers have been put on the ship he said we'll crest every wave amen look he said it was finished let's look at that word finish for a minute because that that's kind of the same meaning the word finish means to bring to a close to finish to end to perform to execute to complete also means this he said to do justice commanded and generally involving the notion of time and this is a a greek scholar that's looking at the word finished he said to do justice commanded and generally involving the notion of time to perform the last act which completes a process in the days of the sounding of the seventh angel's message in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god will be finished the last act right no more ages no more prophets word prophets to the age you understand we believe in prophets but there can't be a prophet come and tell us something different than that prophet did right we believe in pastors but a pastor got no loose ends to tie up right if we're not careful you know we get bored with the message and we want to make some loose ends just so somebody can tie them up we've got what we need church what needs you say what what is lacking right here if something needs to change it's not the message it's me it's all of us some other members said when the seals are broke he said and the mystery is revealed down comes the angel the messenger christ setting his foot upon the land and upon the sea with a rainbow over his head he said now remember again an important statement now remember this seventh angel is on earth at the time of this coming now brother branham doesn't make the connection if you look we have a picture of a cloud we show it sometimes on the board the picture of the cloud that was taken in 1963 brother branham when he preaches the seals i think this is important to understand hasn't made that connection between that cloud he hasn't even seen it yet because he didn't see the cloud in the shape of jesus in the sky as far as we know he's the seven angels come down to him right he hasn't made the connection yet between the cloud and his ministry he doesn't make it until june of 1963 somebody shows it to him and then the angel speaks to him and says turn it to the right you remember if you look at it right it's christ and it's still that today if you look at it right but you got to turn it god god does things perfectly right because people today will will try to knock the cloud you notice that's the main thing they come against right because they try to say well brother branham wasn't up there at that time or whatever that it was but what shape was it in it was in the shape of christ but you had to turn it right see it now as i've said that before if the cloud existed in a vacuum by itself it wouldn't mean much to us just another strange cloud but it happened to be that a prophet was in the area right and that the seals were revealed at that time so it does have significance now he says in what is the attraction in 1965 what is the attraction on the mountain he finally ties it all together at least where i can find where he finally ties it all together is here in 1965 he said the god of heaven promised the evening time would have evening light so you can go back and look at the context like we talked about find out that brother bran was talking about this these seven angels that come down in a cloud that's what he's talking about and then he comes here and he says the god of heaven promised evening time would have evening lights three years ago this mystery was a prophecy what time is it sir what did he prophesy and what time is it sir revelation 10 1-7 an angel by the angel coming down that's what it was three years ago this mystery was a prophecy what time is it sir but now it's history it's past the promise is fulfilled what time is it sir and what's this attraction god fulfilling his word he's the same yesterday today and forever god knows what he's doing doesn't he let's go back to the breach now and again i'm just giving you that for further context so you can see how brother branham carried that through on down in his message and in paragraph 42 brother branham says just as john was giving his message the same time that messiah come in the days john knew he would see him because he was going to introduce him and we realized that in the scriptures over in malachi 4 there is to be one like john and elijah to whom the word of god can come to we're going to move more quickly now and we're almost done for today he says he is to reveal by the holy spirit notice he is to reveal by the holy spirit all the mysteries of god and restore the faith of the children back to the faith of the apostolic fathers restore back all these mysteries that's been probed at through these denominational years he said now that's what the word said i'm just responsible for what it said see it's written he said is right that's what it is he said now we see that this seven still book now is the mystery of redemption it's a book of redemption from god he said now all the mysteries at this time should be finished at the sounding of this messenger he said now here is the angel on earth and another angel a mighty messenger come down see this angel was an earthly angel messenger but here comes one down from heaven a rainbow covenant see only christ it could be always loved that quote only christ it could be why because of the way he come down don't you see what that means to us today it tells us he's here and john came to declare that he was here and he was taken off the scene and brother brown came and declared he's here and was taken off the scene amen hey man now he said only christ it could be couldn't be anybody else amen because somebody had to stand in the breach thank the lord a lamb had to take the book and open the seals people that's a trick question by the way somebody asked you who opened the seals right who opened the seals the lamb opened the seals right and then gave it to his prophet we'll see that later on in the breach if we get to it the lamb opened the sealed book gave it to his prophet and his prophet showed it to us but but the lamb opened it the lamb opens the book and because that's what the bible says and that's what a prophet come to vindicate now he says just exactly like he was in revelation first chapter standing in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks with a rainbow but look upon his jasper and sardis stone and here he returns back in the 10th chapter after the coming time watch again this is sunday night after the coming time that all mysteries is to be finished and the seals are to be broke and proclaiming that its time is no more and i know and please don't you i know you're gonna run ahead of me to the seventh seal but just wait on that for a while maybe we'll get to that maybe the lord permits me to stay here for five or ten or fifteen or twenty years maybe we'll get to that part of it takes a while to work through some of this stuff but but you understand that there's there's some things brother branham said there about that seventh seal and there's a part of that that we don't know we don't know when he's coming we don't know the day or the hour somebody says they do they're wrong we don't know there's a part that was held in the mind of god i'm so grateful that everything we need to know to make it's been said amen now he said he said and when the seventh angels begin to sound and the mystery should be finished and time for the angel to appear we're close somewhere amen he said right he said now notice he said the seven seals holds the mystery of the book until we can see what those seven seals has sealed in we're only presuming them things see the seals the opening of the seals was more than just brother branham telling us giving us an idea of what these things meant because many other men had come preached on the seals and said this is what it means this is what it means that's what it means some of them even got it right many men did that but there was one that it was actually a vindication of his ministry right and it was a vindicated opening of the word so what didn't just happen in a vacuum but it was god vindicating he used it to vindicate brother branham's ministry to show us he was that laodicean messenger right because unless he was that seventh angel then the seals wouldn't be open during his time during his sounding but if he was the seventh angel it had to be opened during his sounding right now he says he said until we see that we're only presuming them things i don't want to presume i'm done presuming right brother running uses that word by the way and in is it is this the sign of the end sir he uses that word presuming a lot because he doesn't know what it's going to be but it was a prophecy but now we have more than a prophecy right when that when the when jesus he said a virgin shall conceive that was a prophecy but when a baby began crying in a manger it was more than a prophecy it was a prophecy fulfilled and when when god said that the these seals would be broke that the mystery god would be finished in this time of the seventh angel's message it was a prophecy but now it's more than a prophecy it's a fulfilling we've seen that fulfilled now look he says because i've told you this morning upon my little message this morning of god hiding in simplicity he said you see we are sure to miss the thing notice we are sure to miss the thing you say we might miss it we will miss it unless it is absolutely genuinely revealed by the holy spirit and vindicated the same i'll tell you i'll say this it has to be revealed to your heart this is what brother branham says in all close musicians would go ahead and come i was late coming out but i'm not late quitting i know these things can get dry and i can overload you i don't want to leave you where you don't remember what i said what he said he said but if the prophet rises and tells you that this is just that right so if a prophet comes and tells you that this is that just that this is the opening of the word we can say it that way and god don't vindicate the same forget it remember brother brown doesn't know about that cloud that shows up in life magazine huh but god in every statement amen see if god don't vindicate it he said forget it it's not see god always vindicates his word and see he said and he said well how does he do that today well you say i'm a christian how does he vindicate it by your life he vindicates it in your life you live as a christian you do the greater works you you fulfill the the part of a christian amen he says but he said if you don't vindicate the same forget it see but god in every statement and everything has to vindicate it to make it right so his children will watch those things amen and be alert and they won't just pass it off say well it was just this or that or the other was just an air force base or whatever that it was but they watched what what form was it in it means something to me today after all of these years why because his children will watch those things and see if god vindicated in the heavens what a prophet said on the earth amen amen so much more than just another denominational teacher coming up with another theory but god vindicating his word luke 21 36 watched you therefore and pray always that's the attitude that we should be in jesus even about his own words that he said he said watch and pray that you may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass and to stand before the son of man there was a i read a story forgive me for leaving you with a story but it's something i like to do i like to read and read a story that a danish philosopher by the name of kirkegaard told a parable of a where theater variety shows is going on and each time they have an act it's more fantastic than the last one so they come out the first time something simple and it just keeps getting more complicated and more crazy and the people are so excited you know how you would be at a magic show or something like that and so the every every show is applauded by the audience suddenly the manager come come forward he said i'm sorry for the interruption but the theater's on fire he says he begin to beg the people to leave in an orderly fashion and the audience thinks this is the best part of the show so they applaud they all applaud [Music] but they needed to listen [Music] you see what what age we live in and the old philosopher said this he said the fire raced to the whole building and the consumed the audience with it he said i he said so will our age i sometimes think go down in fiery destruction to the applause of a crowded house of cheering spectators he said watch and pray she may be counted worthy to escape these things it shall come to pass don't don't let later see it get to you until you think your applause for the messenger is enough the applause for the messenger won't get you out of the building it won't you need to listen to what he said just saying i believe him yes your wonderful messenger brother brahm covered that so clearly in the token he said it's not enough he makes a statement it's not enough to believe but you got to believe unto salvation you've got to believe it and act on what you believe if you really believe you're going to act on it amen let's bow our heads together heavenly father i pray today lord as i've maybe been more sober than we have lately in this last part of this sermon but god it just stirred my heart help me lord i i see what you've done for us in this message and i i applaud it lord i want to stand and applaud the messenger that you sent
