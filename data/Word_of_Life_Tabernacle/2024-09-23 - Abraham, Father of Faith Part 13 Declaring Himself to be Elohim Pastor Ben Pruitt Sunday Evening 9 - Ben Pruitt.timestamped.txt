[46:04] dust we went over it just a couple of
[46:06] weeks ago and blew into it created
[46:10] himself a body and then he come down in
[46:12] that body and let's go have a potluck
[46:15] with Abraham let's go talk to Abraham
[46:17] see what Abraham's got to say and I want
[46:21] he wanted to reveal himself he wanted to
[46:23] fellowship with Abraham I I believe he
[46:26] still wants to fellowship with you
[46:28] tonight he still wants to fellowship
[46:30] with you he he wants to fellowship with
[46:32] me he wants to he wants to reveal
[46:35] himself to to us we just have to take
[46:37] the time to make him welcome so he can
[46:40] do that now the way that he did that now
[46:43] when he come down remember he had dust
[46:46] on his clothes brother brandom gives us
[46:48] that that detail of how he come down he
[46:50] looked like a weary traveler he come
[46:53] down just as any other uh human being
[46:55] would be and he come down in such a way
[46:58] that it seemed like that uh that they
[47:00] just uh that that he was just an
[47:02] ordinary man and to anyone without that
[47:05] caliber of faith that Abraham had it
[47:08] would seem like that this was just
[47:09] another man just another service just
[47:12] another passer by just another preacher
[47:15] but to Abraham he looked at it and said
[47:17] there's something more about what God's
[47:19] doing this is God speaking he said I've
[47:22] heard that voice before but there had to
[47:24] come a confirmation of Abraham's faith
[47:27] something that was done at that time
[47:30] that would tell him this is who I say it
[47:32] is this is who I think it is and so God
[47:35] was going to do something now we know
[47:37] that he is the word we talked about that
[47:39] this morning in the beginning was the
[47:41] word and the Word was with God and the
[47:43] Word was God and the word the Bible
[47:45] tells us is a discerner of the thoughts
[47:48] and the intents of the heart it's alive
[47:51] and powerful and a discerner of the
[47:53] thoughts and intents of the heart so we
[47:55] know that when God came one of the
[47:57] things that you could know God by is he
[48:00] would know things about us that we don't
[48:03] even know about ourselves he would know
[48:06] our past and our future he would know do
[48:08] you realize God knows everything about
[48:10] you tonight he knows everything you
[48:12] struggled with he knows he knows what
[48:14] you've been through during the week he
[48:15] knows what your bank account looks like
[48:17] he knows the Bible says if he if he
[48:20] cares for the sparrow if not a one will
[48:22] fall to the ground he said how much more
[48:24] are you worth than many sparrows we
[48:26] should always believe God knows us and
[48:29] he he cares about us but here at the end
[48:32] time we needed to know that God was
[48:35] speaking and so God was going to allow
[48:37] him to do something that he did when he
[48:39] was here on the earth to show us who he
[48:43] was not a man but God now
[48:48] look now Elohim come down in flesh and
[48:53] again that's a hard concept for some
[48:54] people because they see the flesh but
[48:56] it's God in us Christ in you Paul says
[48:59] the hope of glory so it's not just God
[49:02] in a prophet or God in this body that he
[49:04] created now he's he's separated himself
[49:07] into the body of Believers into his
[49:10] bride he comes down he begins to speak
[49:13] to him can you imagine if you just
[49:14] imagine the scene and the setting of it
[49:17] here's Abraham in the tent door he sees
[49:20] the dusty Travelers passing by and he
[49:22] stops him he says why don't you sit down
[49:24] here he said let me wash the Dust off
[49:27] your feet let me let me uh let me make
[49:29] you welcome and they come in and they
[49:31] begin to eat a meal and he's standing
[49:33] there shoe the flies away all of a
[49:37] sudden the man looked up at him and he
[49:39] said oh my this was going to identify
[49:42] which of these three was God in flesh he
[49:46] looked at him and he said where's your
[49:49] wife
[49:51] Sarah oh my notice what he says where is
[49:55] Sarah thy wife notice he did not call
[49:59] her by her old name Sarai which is s a r
[50:04] AI he called her by Sarah which was a
[50:08] name she'd only had for one day Abraham
[50:12] had only had his name for one day and
[50:15] Sarah had only had hers for one day what
[50:17] was it he was calling them by the names
[50:20] he gave them and so he identified
[50:23] himself by identifying who they were
[50:27] there's a revelation in that church he
[50:29] identified himself by identifying them
[50:33] and so he showed them who they were now
[50:35] watch what he did he actually God had
[50:38] changed Abraham's Name by inserting an H
[50:41] in the middle of his name what was he
[50:42] doing in the H at the end of Sarah's
[50:44] name what was he doing he was he was
[50:46] combining his name with their name he
[50:49] said I'm going to be your helper I'm
[50:50] going to be El Shai I'm going to I'm
[50:53] going to work through you I'm going to
[50:55] see that the promise is fulfilled and
[50:57] that your bodies are changed so notice
[50:59] now what he does when he comes and
[51:01] reveals himself he calls them by name
[51:04] and he said he said Abraham where's your
[51:07] wife and how did he know she was he was
[51:09] married where's your wife
[51:12] Sarah and and he it wasn't her name
[51:15] originally but he called her some of you
[51:17] kids like this by her princess
[51:20] name cuz Sarah means
[51:23] princess her old name I looked it up it
[51:25] means dominated
[51:30] thank God for a new
[51:33] name so she went from dominating to
[51:37] being princess aren't you glad that God
[51:40] doesn't just leave you with your old
[51:42] identity when he saves you he don't just
[51:44] leave you with your old identity he
[51:46] don't just leave you with all your sin
[51:48] and the baggage and the things hanging
[51:50] on you what does he do brother West he
[51:52] calls you out and he said I'm going to
[51:54] give you a new name I'm going to call
[51:57] you by your Royal Name by your Priestly
[51:59] name I'm going to call you
[52:01] Sarah amen Sarah princess he called her
[52:06] by her princess name a a and so this
[52:09] would be a sign that God knew her he
[52:12] knew who she was where is your wife
[52:15] Sarah it would show that this was a
[52:18] prophet he'd come as a prophet as we
[52:19] talked about this morning that the son
[52:21] of man would be uh a son of man would be
[52:24] a prophet that would come and that's how
[52:26] God would reveal himself as through a
[52:28] prophet he identified himself the one
[52:30] that stayed with Abraham identified
[52:32] himself he was sitting with his back to
[52:34] the tent he said remember he had been
[52:36] Abram till just a day or two before that
[52:39] and and now she is Sarah and he is
[52:41] Abraham notice he called him not his
[52:43] first name his given name but he called
[52:46] he said Abraham where is your wife Sarah
[52:48] Sarah princess and he identified himself
[52:52] by this sign calling their names and
[52:54] knowing the secrets of the hearts I've
[52:57] already quoted this scripture he said
[52:58] but the word of God is quick and
[53:00] Powerful do you believe it's powerful
[53:03] today let's say it to the the logos of
[53:06] God the word is alive and powerful and
[53:10] sharper than any two-edged sword
[53:12] piercing even to the dividing us under
[53:15] Soul and Spirit of the joints and Marrow
[53:17] is a discerner of the thoughts and
[53:20] intents of the heart so in other words
[53:22] he knows the secrets of the heart are
[53:26] you with me so far
[53:27] tonight he knows the secret of the heart
[53:30] I'm working a lot harder than anybody
[53:32] else here
[53:34] so I know it's tired man it's hard on a
[53:37] Sunday afternoon but let's just look at
[53:39] the word from me doesn't that refresh
[53:40] your soul doesn't it do something for
[53:43] you look the man looking at Abraham
[53:45] Sarah in the tent behind him said why
[53:46] did Sarah laugh saying how can these
[53:49] things be he identified himself and we
[53:52] know that this setting according to Luke
[53:53] 17:30 as as it was in the days of Noah
[53:56] Noah as it was in the days of lot this
[53:59] setting is to be repeated at the end
[54:00] time at the revealing of the son of man
[54:03] now brother BR said look at the world
[54:05] today if it ain't a common Sodom and
[54:06] Gomorrah I never seen one he said this a
[54:08] long time ago in the 60s look at today
[54:11] if it's not Sodom out there what is
[54:14] it right we live right in the middle of
[54:17] Sodom but look church that's not what
[54:19] our focus is on we're not focused on
[54:23] Sodom because we've been called out of
[54:24] Sodom and so our focus is not on what's
[54:27] going on all around us although that's
[54:29] part of it we see the signs of the times
[54:31] but our focus is not on that but Abraham
[54:34] was talking to the one who knew the
[54:36] secrets of his heart and I believe that
[54:38] the one that knows the secrets of your
[54:40] heart is still here today he's the same
[54:42] yesterday today and forever and he wants
[54:44] to talk to you he wants to he wants to
[54:47] have a communication with each one of us
[54:50] but he talked about Sodom and Gomorrah
[54:52] and how lot was sitting there and just
[54:53] grieving his righteous Soul like
[54:56] ministers today in many places who are
[54:58] afraid to speak out against sin afraid
[55:00] to speak out against the worldliness
[55:01] that's going on why because they they
[55:04] didn't have the audacity to stand up for
[55:06] what was right and that was lot it vexed
[55:08] his soul but he never did nothing about
[55:10] it he said that's the modern Sodom and
[55:12] Gomorrah today but there are some of
[55:14] those who are outside of Sodom I love
[55:16] this that's born out there not by the
[55:19] will of man but by the will of God and
[55:21] the seed of God can you say Amen to that
[55:23] today were you born outside of Sodom I
[55:25] didn't come from from Sodom I'm Sodom is
[55:27] not my destination Sodom is not my end
[55:30] I'm not going to end up in the
[55:31] tribulation period I'm going in a
[55:39] Rapture he said watch the identification
[55:41] there not just the
[55:43] preaching he said but the sign
[55:45] identified the word of God made flesh in
[55:47] a man there multiple examples in the
[55:51] scripture of the son of man revealing
[55:53] the secrets of people's hearts
[55:56] and he did that to show who he was so he
[56:00] did that to Abraham think about it you
[56:02] kids can even understand this he did
[56:04] that to Abraham he revealed The Secret
[56:07] of his heart and he said not only knew
[56:09] that he wanted a baby that he was
[56:11] married but what his wife's name was and
[56:13] said you're going to have a baby about
[56:15] this time according to the time of life
[56:18] so now he showed him who he was and
[56:21] Abraham said my Lord and identified him
[56:25] as Elohim now in in in in the gospels
[56:28] when Jesus came to the Earth he
[56:30] identified himself to Peter in John
[56:32] chapter 1 and verse 40 it says one of
[56:34] the two which heard John speak and
[56:36] follow him was Andrew Simon Peter's
[56:37] brother he first findeth his own brother
[56:40] Simon I love Andrew in the scripture if
[56:42] you go look him up Andrew was a helper
[56:44] Andrew was always getting somebody in
[56:46] the presence of Jesus I think that ought
[56:48] to be all of us he was getting somebody
[56:50] in the presence of Jesus and so he was
[56:53] uh he he first finds his own brother
[56:55] Simon says to him we we have found the
[56:56] Messiah which is being interpreted the
[56:59] Christ and he brought him to Jesus and
[57:02] when Jesus beheld him now notice he
[57:05] doesn't know anything about him but he
[57:06] said Thou Art Simon the son of Jonah
[57:10] thou shall be called sephus or Peter
[57:13] which is by
[57:14] interpretation a
[57:16] stone can you imagine what would that
[57:19] have done to him well it confirms in his
[57:22] heart that this is the one that Andrew
[57:24] told him about Andrew tells him it's one
[57:27] thing to hear it it's another thing to
[57:29] have the secret of the heart revealed
[57:32] and so in verse 43 we find a man named
[57:35] Phillip and the day following Jesus
[57:38] would go forth into Galilee and findeth
[57:40] Phillip and saith unto him follow me and
[57:43] Phillip was of bada the city of Andrew
[57:45] and Peter and Phillip findeth Nathaniel
[57:49] and sayith unto him so he goes looking
[57:51] for somebody to tell that we found the
[57:54] listen if you find the Messiah you're
[57:55] going to look for somebody to tell if
[57:58] you found the truth you're going to look
[57:59] for somebody to tell about it you're not
[58:01] going to be ashamed of it you're going
[58:03] to be looking for somebody that needs to
[58:05] hear it and so he found somebody that
[58:07] needed to hear it and he said we found
[58:10] him who are they talking about who Moses
[58:12] in the law and the prophets did right
[58:14] Jesus of Nazareth the son of Joseph
[58:17] notice who we found he saying we found
[58:19] the Messiah and Nathaniel said unto him
[58:23] and Nathaniel may be being a little bit
[58:24] of a legalist right right he says can
[58:26] there any good thing come out of
[58:29] Nazareth and Philip saith unto him come
[58:31] see what a great
[58:34] answer what a great answer can there be
[58:37] any good thing come out of come out of
[58:39] Hardy Arkansas come and see come see for
[58:42] yourself can there be any good thing
[58:44] come out of the place where you live he
[58:46] just said come look at him come see and
[58:48] Jesus saw Nathaniel coming to him and
[58:51] saith of him behold an Israelite indeed
[58:54] in whom is no
[58:57] G listen to this this is powerful
[59:00] Nathaniel saith unto him whence knowest
[59:02] thou me now you couldn't have told an
[59:05] Israelite by dress in that day from a
[59:08] bedin from a from an Arab or really have
[59:11] Arabs in but a Palestinian of any type
[59:14] they all look the same on the outside
[59:17] how did he know and how did he know that
[59:20] he was an honest man now think about it
[59:24] he he how did he know that and and
[59:26] Nathaniel said unto him whence knowest
[59:29] thou me I love Jesus answer Jesus
[59:33] answered and said to him before Philip
[59:35] called you when you were under the Fig
[59:38] Tree I saw thee now this is important
[59:41] how did Jesus know the things that he
[59:44] told the people he saw
[59:47] it right he had a vision of it he he he
[59:51] saw it in a vision so somebody comes to
[59:53] you and says I have a word from the lord
[59:55] well could be a word from the Lord could
[59:57] be a prophecy could be one of the nine
[59:59] spiritual gifts but the way that he saw
[1:00:01] it was by Vision because when the son of
[1:00:04] man came to the Earth he come as a
[1:00:06] prophet right but he was also God
[1:00:08] wrapped in flesh but he come as a
[1:00:11] prophet and so he sees it by Vision
[1:00:13] which is how a prophet would see it he
[1:00:15] said when you were under the Fig Tree I
[1:00:18] saw thee God's got eyes on you
[1:00:22] tonight he knows what you're going
[1:00:24] through he got eyes on you he knows
[1:00:26] what's what has happened what will
[1:00:27] happen he knows all about it so they had
[1:00:30] been taught that Messiah would be a
[1:00:31] prophet again remember the son of man
[1:00:34] they'd been taught according to Daniel
[1:00:36] according to Ezekiel they had been
[1:00:37] taught that the son of man the Messiah
[1:00:39] would be a son of man would be a prophet
[1:00:41] and so they recognized that that there
[1:00:43] must be something about him and so this
[1:00:45] was a sign that it was him in John
[1:00:48] chapter 4 we'll use this as a third
[1:00:50] witness so we could use others as well
[1:00:53] in John 4:4 the ible tells us that Jesus
[1:00:57] must needs go through
[1:00:59] Samaria he he had a a need to go by that
[1:01:03] way what was it there was a
[1:01:04] predestinated seat of God in Samaria
[1:01:07] that needed to be talked to that needed
[1:01:09] to have a conversation with Elohim so
[1:01:13] Jesus just like he went as a Dusty
[1:01:16] traveler to show himself to Abraham he
[1:01:19] goes and appears to the woman at the
[1:01:21] well she don't know where this man come
[1:01:23] from here she's coming up at a different
[1:01:25] time than everybody else did because of
[1:01:27] her uh her her her stigma she had
[1:01:30] because of the Scarlet Letter that she
[1:01:32] carried she was unable to come when
[1:01:34] everybody else did so she'd come up by
[1:01:36] herself and just at that moment here was
[1:01:38] Jesus sitting by the well and he just
[1:01:41] happened to be at the right place at the
[1:01:43] right time do you remember when you met
[1:01:45] him do you remember what it was like
[1:01:46] what was it Jesus found you you weren't
[1:01:49] necessarily looking for him but he was
[1:01:51] looking for you and he come by the place
[1:01:54] where you were he must needs go through
[1:01:57] Samaria I'm so glad the message come by
[1:01:59] my way I'm so glad that the gospel come
[1:02:02] by my way I'm so glad that I heard it
[1:02:04] I'm so glad I grew up where I did in the
[1:02:06] family why because God enabled me to
[1:02:08] hear the
[1:02:10] message I'm happy of that believe God's
[1:02:13] enabled you to hear it today and all of
[1:02:16] your life when you've heard it you can
[1:02:17] say thank God you had need to go by my
[1:02:20] way he begin to talk to her about the
[1:02:23] water now brother brandom tells us so
[1:02:26] when we go to witness to somebody don't
[1:02:27] don't beat them over the head with
[1:02:31] Doctrine right how do you witness to
[1:02:33] somebody he said talk to them about
[1:02:34] fishing something they're interested in
[1:02:37] talk to them and then after a while you
[1:02:39] can become friends with the person
[1:02:41] because they'll never accept it unless
[1:02:43] they believe that the one telling it is
[1:02:46] has an interest in their life right your
[1:02:49] kids are never going to believe you
[1:02:51] unless they know you love
[1:02:54] them you can beat them all you want to
[1:02:57] you can you can you can make them tow
[1:02:59] the line and keep all the rules but if
[1:03:01] they don't know you love them they're
[1:03:02] never going to believe
[1:03:05] it right because you you you've got to
[1:03:08] have that conversation brother brandom
[1:03:09] calls it contacting a spirit you got to
[1:03:11] have that conversation you got to have
[1:03:13] the time to spend with them God help us
[1:03:16] today he talks to about the water and
[1:03:19] and and and how the well and all those
[1:03:21] things and then he says something
[1:03:22] strange in verse
[1:03:24] 16 Jes Jesus saith un her go call thy
[1:03:28] husband and come hither call thy husband
[1:03:33] and come hither and the woman answered
[1:03:34] and said I have no husband boy she's
[1:03:39] gotten good at telling that
[1:03:41] detail she got good at obscuring her
[1:03:44] past when someone ask but Jesus knew all
[1:03:48] about it and Jesus said unto her thou
[1:03:51] Hast well said I have not no husband for
[1:03:54] thou Hast had five
[1:03:56] husbands see she was looking for
[1:03:58] something Church she was looking for
[1:04:01] something and many times we see people
[1:04:02] on drugs people people on addicted to
[1:04:05] alcohol people addicted to cigarettes
[1:04:07] you look at and what are they doing
[1:04:08] they're looking for some fulfillment
[1:04:09] they're looking for something in their
[1:04:11] life that'll that'll make a difference
[1:04:13] in their life it's not and I think
[1:04:15] looking at that you say well why are
[1:04:17] they doing what they're doing because
[1:04:18] they're a sinner but we have a savior
[1:04:20] there's somebody who can save that
[1:04:22] person she was looking for something she
[1:04:25] couldn't find it so she had five
[1:04:27] husbands he said he whom thou now Hast
[1:04:29] is not thy husband in that say thou
[1:04:32] truly and the woman saith unto him sir
[1:04:36] now watch this she'd been taught that a
[1:04:38] prophet when he came would have this
[1:04:41] kind of knowledge and she said I
[1:04:43] perceive that thou art a
[1:04:45] prophet our fathers worshiped in this
[1:04:48] mountain and you say that Jerusalem is a
[1:04:49] place where men ought to worship and
[1:04:51] Jesus said unto her woman believe me the
[1:04:53] hour cometh when you shall neither in
[1:04:54] this mountain nor yet Jerusalem worship
[1:04:56] the father you worship you know not what
[1:04:58] we know what we worship for salvation is
[1:05:00] of the Jews but the hour cometh and now
[1:05:02] is when the true worshippers shall
[1:05:04] worship the father in spirit and in
[1:05:06] truth for the father seeketh such to
[1:05:08] worship Him He said God is a spirit and
[1:05:11] they that worship Him must worship Him
[1:05:13] in spirit and in Truth Listen church
[1:05:15] it's not enough to just have the letter
[1:05:17] the letter kth but the spirit giveth
[1:05:18] life we've got to worship Him in spirit
[1:05:21] and in truth John 4:25 the woman saith
[1:05:23] in him I know that Messiah cometh which
[1:05:26] is called Christ when he has come he
[1:05:28] will tell us someone say it with me all
[1:05:31] things he will oh church and Jesus said
[1:05:35] unto her I that speak unto thee am he
[1:05:39] what was he doing declaring
[1:05:43] himself glory to God oh I don't mean
[1:05:46] to do I need to calm down on Sunday
[1:05:49] afternoon what was he doing he declared
[1:05:53] himself oh she was a seat of God he
[1:05:56] never told the Pharisees that plainly he
[1:05:58] never told pilate plainly he never told
[1:06:00] many others plainly but he told the
[1:06:02] woman at the well he said I am he that
[1:06:05] speaketh to thee he said I'm that person
[1:06:07] I'm the one you read about in the
[1:06:09] scriptures I'm the one Moses talked
[1:06:11] about I'm the one David sing about I'm
[1:06:14] the one that they pointed to all through
[1:06:15] the Old Testament I am
[1:06:17] he what was he doing declaring himself
[1:06:21] to be the god the logos the word that
[1:06:23] come from God and made a body of Flesh
[1:06:25] lived on the
[1:06:27] earth oh
[1:06:29] Church Jesus said I'm he and upon this
[1:06:32] came his disciples and marveled that he
[1:06:34] talked with the woman yet no man said
[1:06:36] what seekest thou why talkest thou with
[1:06:39] her oh
[1:06:41] my woman then left her water pot and
[1:06:43] went her way into the City and said to
[1:06:44] the men come see a man which told me all
[1:06:49] things that ever I
[1:06:51] did is not this the Christ
[1:06:58] brother brand said the reason she
[1:07:00] believed is because she had
[1:07:01] representation in
[1:07:03] heaven which shows us that always you
[1:07:06] know living the Pharisees lived much
[1:07:08] better lives but they did not have
[1:07:10] representation in heaven so they could
[1:07:13] not believe oh but she had the capacity
[1:07:16] to believe something on the inside when
[1:07:20] she saw the sign of the Messiah she
[1:07:22] didn't try to explain it away she didn't
[1:07:24] say well somebody told you that she said
[1:07:26] Thou Art the
[1:07:28] Christ can't come see a man who told me
[1:07:30] all the things I ever did is not this
[1:07:33] the
[1:07:34] Christ these three Witnesses among many
[1:07:37] others as I said tell us he is the
[1:07:40] Messiah he is the Messiah and yet he
[1:07:43] told us that when they looked for him
[1:07:45] for a sign they were always looking for
[1:07:46] another sign he said a wicked and
[1:07:48] adulterous generation seeketh after a
[1:07:50] sign there shall no sign be given unto
[1:07:53] it but the sign of the prophet Jonah and
[1:07:56] he left them and departed the sign of
[1:07:59] the Prophet Jonas which is Jonah what
[1:08:00] was the sign of the Prophet Jonas what
[1:08:02] was Jonah a type of he was a type of the
[1:08:05] Resurrection that's what Jesus said as
[1:08:07] the son of man was as Jonas was three
[1:08:10] days in the belly of the well so will
[1:08:11] the son of man be three days in the
[1:08:13] belly of the Earth right what was a sign
[1:08:16] of the Resurrection so in other words a
[1:08:18] sign that he was living that he was
[1:08:21] alive I want to show you because we
[1:08:23] realize and and and tonight I don't want
[1:08:26] to get too technical I want to preach
[1:08:27] this as much as I can but we realize
[1:08:29] that God still loves us he still cares
[1:08:31] about us he still knows and he come down
[1:08:34] in a prophetic gift in this generation
[1:08:36] that was one to an age that would tell
[1:08:38] us that but then he didn't stop there
[1:08:41] he's still a discerner of the secrets of
[1:08:42] the hearts but he come down in this
[1:08:45] special way in our generation so we
[1:08:48] could see that he was the same in leoa
[1:08:51] in this church age as he was at the
[1:08:53] Beginning Church age he was the same now
[1:08:55] as he was when he walked the shores of
[1:08:57] Galilee listen to this I this is from
[1:09:00] one
[1:09:01] service one service brother brandom is
[1:09:04] talking to the people he said the first
[1:09:06] thing I I see to the woman she's got
[1:09:08] sinus trouble it's a bothering her he
[1:09:11] said it's exactly right it's a headache
[1:09:12] like across their sinus it bothers her
[1:09:14] and I see you kneeling and praying now
[1:09:17] this isn't somebody supposing something
[1:09:20] it's not somebody that but what is it
[1:09:23] it's the same God
[1:09:26] not the man but God the same God that oh
[1:09:29] church that sat there and told Nathaniel
[1:09:32] when when you were under the Fig Tree I
[1:09:34] saw
[1:09:35] you that same
[1:09:37] God he said I see you kneeling in a room
[1:09:41] I hear what you're saying you're asking
[1:09:44] a worthy thing you believe he still
[1:09:46] hears you tonight you're asking a worthy
[1:09:49] thing you're asking God to give a CH
[1:09:51] give you a child a baby you're Barren
[1:09:53] and asking God to give you a baby that's
[1:09:54] right God bless you I've never seen him
[1:09:56] fail on one yet a woman in Chicago he
[1:09:59] said 50 something years old come and ask
[1:10:00] for a baby she got a fine boy she might
[1:10:04] have regretted it later she's 50
[1:10:05] something years old but huh but because
[1:10:09] he said that was something it was a good
[1:10:11] desire it was something that that God
[1:10:13] wanted to give to his children he said
[1:10:15] may God grant it to you again he he says
[1:10:17] this he said seems like I I see like
[1:10:20] swamps or something I don't know whether
[1:10:22] it's this country lot of Cedar looks
[1:10:24] like swamp Willow it's kind of passing
[1:10:26] looks like Arkansas to me he said was
[1:10:29] you ever in Arkansas he said it seems to
[1:10:32] me like it was Arkansas it's Arkansas
[1:10:33] it's
[1:10:34] Jonesboro Arkansas the Blessed old Bible
[1:10:37] Hour Tabernacle where you're from and
[1:10:39] you're down there and you're trying to
[1:10:40] contact there's somebody else in there
[1:10:42] that's trying to make a contact said
[1:10:43] it's an aged woman that's standing he
[1:10:45] said you're from a rolling country maybe
[1:10:47] Missouri he said that's your mother he
[1:10:49] said there she sits right there she's
[1:10:51] got hardening of the arteries these
[1:10:53] aren't even people that were coming up
[1:10:55] to the platform it's just people in the
[1:10:57] audience that come to hear him in
[1:11:00] another state in another place he said
[1:11:02] that's right exactly the truth go
[1:11:04] believing and may the god of heaven give
[1:11:06] you the desire of your heart my sister
[1:11:08] through Jesus Christ's name again he
[1:11:10] said little lady sitting on the end of
[1:11:12] the seat there you're bothered with a
[1:11:13] nervous condition isn't it got real
[1:11:15] weary spill spells come on you don't
[1:11:17] fear it's gone from you you believe he
[1:11:19] can still deliver from nervousness today
[1:11:21] what was he doing there's a reason why
[1:11:23] this builds faith it builds Faith
[1:11:25] because we believe he's the same
[1:11:26] yesterday today and forever he doesn't
[1:11:28] change if he healed somebody in 2,000
[1:11:31] years ago he'll heal somebody tonight if
[1:11:33] they approach him in the same way if he
[1:11:35] healed somebody in 1965 he'll heal
[1:11:37] somebody tonight the same
[1:11:39] way oh I I don't I don't need a vision
[1:11:43] or or even a prophet to speak I believe
[1:11:45] God still does all of those things but I
[1:11:47] don't need those things to believe it I
[1:11:49] believe he's still the same and I
[1:11:52] believe that the Bible says if they lay
[1:11:53] hands on the sick they shall recover how
[1:11:55] many believe that today they shall
[1:11:58] recover what does that do it builds our
[1:11:59] faith knowing if he did it in my
[1:12:01] generation he can do it for
[1:12:04] me what was he doing declaring himself
[1:12:07] like he did Abraham Abraham you need a
[1:12:09] special portion you need to know this is
[1:12:11] him he said I'm declaring myself to be L
[1:12:15] him
[1:12:16] Hallelujah Oh
[1:12:20] my he said you got a nervous Condition
[1:12:22] it's gone from me what about you sitting
[1:12:23] there with prostate trouble
[1:12:26] we we believe God still heals that don't
[1:12:27] we brother
[1:12:29] Danny said the man looking down across
[1:12:31] the balcony right up there the elderly
[1:12:33] man prostate trouble getting up at night
[1:12:35] you believe sir raise up your hand
[1:12:37] standing right up here that's it you
[1:12:38] believe white shirt on sitting all right
[1:12:40] it's finished you're healed have you got
[1:12:42] a prayer card he said you don't have a
[1:12:43] prayer card you don't need one they use
[1:12:46] prayer cards to keep line or keep
[1:12:48] ordering the lines when they would have
[1:12:49] prayer lines and people today have tried
[1:12:51] to attribute this discernment to that
[1:12:54] and it's it's absolutely nonsense you
[1:12:56] don't have to read very far in the
[1:12:57] message to realize brother Brandon
[1:12:59] wasn't reading prayer cards because
[1:13:01] there are literally hundreds or
[1:13:03] thousands perhaps of cases where he
[1:13:05] spoke to people in the
[1:13:06] audience they he never met and never met
[1:13:08] again and some of them I've known and
[1:13:10] talked to some of you all known and talk
[1:13:12] to him brother brand preached future
[1:13:13] home there's two women on future home
[1:13:15] that he calls out that are from this
[1:13:18] area that I knew personally and one of
[1:13:20] them was Sister Brown I was her pastor
[1:13:22] for a while and I knew sister Brown
[1:13:24] never knew brother brandom she didn't
[1:13:26] know anything about him all she knew she
[1:13:27] was going to Jeffersonville cuz she'd
[1:13:29] heard that he was preaching and she went
[1:13:31] up there to hear him preach and she was
[1:13:33] sitting there she' come with somebody
[1:13:34] else with a worse condition than her and
[1:13:36] she's sitting there brother Brown speaks
[1:13:37] to her he said you little lady sitting
[1:13:38] on the edge of your seat he said he said
[1:13:40] you've got a signus trouble she didn't
[1:13:42] come with a great need but God cares
[1:13:44] about the small things too he said you
[1:13:46] got a sign of trouble if you believe
[1:13:48] it'll leave you and her testimony to me
[1:13:49] at a hundred years old when I met her
[1:13:51] was that God delivered her and she never
[1:13:53] had it again
[1:13:56] am you say that's something that you
[1:13:59] don't do by some kind of a
[1:14:02] trick are you with me now Satan wants to
[1:14:04] feed that to you to scare you but I'm
[1:14:07] not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus
[1:14:09] [Applause]
[1:14:12] Christ he's still the same
[1:14:14] today he speaks to another lady he said
[1:14:18] you have a different type of nervousness
[1:14:19] the lady sitting there with a little
[1:14:20] paper in her hand you got a nervous
[1:14:23] condition too but yours is a weary type
[1:14:24] of nervous nervousness you're mentally
[1:14:26] upset all the time just seems like that
[1:14:29] you get gloomy and weary feeling isn't
[1:14:31] it that's right many times you get real
[1:14:33] weak before your day's work is done you
[1:14:35] have to sit down your strength is
[1:14:36] depleted isn't that
[1:14:38] right sometimes you get so weary you
[1:14:40] walk over to the window I see you pull
[1:14:42] back the window I see you pull back the
[1:14:44] window and walk back and forth that's
[1:14:48] powerful the sun shining down on the
[1:14:50] side makes you have a real gloomy weary
[1:14:53] feeling isn't that right if that's right
[1:14:54] raise up your hand hand that's right he
[1:14:56] said I'm not reading your mind but
[1:14:58] sister it's over your faith has touched
[1:15:01] him now now you go and be real
[1:15:02] happy said this lady Satan lied to you I
[1:15:06] seen a dark shadow come to you and said
[1:15:08] you're going to lose your mind go crazy
[1:15:10] he said that to you that's right
[1:15:12] suggested suicide and everything else
[1:15:14] but it didn't do a bit of good oh I
[1:15:16] think we could we could Rejoice right
[1:15:18] here for a while because that old same
[1:15:20] Devil he's still alive today and he
[1:15:22] still torments and he's tried to suggest
[1:15:24] suicide to many of you you but it didn't
[1:15:25] work why because God came by amen God
[1:15:30] came by and delivered you from that
[1:15:32] Spirit oh he's still a deliverer today
[1:15:35] Oh my he said that's right he said he
[1:15:37] said God it didn't do a bit of good
[1:15:39] God's healed you that's right you're
[1:15:40] going home now to be well again he said
[1:15:43] it's the lady with glasses on here she
[1:15:44] stands right here before me there she is
[1:15:47] he said viruses isn't it sister now
[1:15:49] we've had our fi of viruses haven't we
[1:15:52] he said got a virus isn't that right he
[1:15:54] said they don't even know what to call
[1:15:58] it so that's just an excuse the doctor
[1:16:00] give you that's all but it don't do no
[1:16:03] good now it's over what was it God
[1:16:05] declaring himself not the man but God
[1:16:08] was saying I'm
[1:16:11] here it's over you can go ahead and be
[1:16:14] well your faith made you well he said I
[1:16:16] don't know these those people I never
[1:16:17] seen them I don't know you but I
[1:16:19] challenge you in Christ's name to
[1:16:20] believe the Bible is true and Jesus
[1:16:22] raised from the dead he said Do You
[1:16:24] Believe believe that lady sitting right
[1:16:25] there yes had more faith than you
[1:16:27] thought you had some of you don't think
[1:16:28] you got enough Faith to believe that
[1:16:30] lady didn't think she had enough Faith
[1:16:32] to attract The Prophet's attention but
[1:16:33] he said you got more faith than you
[1:16:35] think you had I think we got a lot of
[1:16:36] people sitting here that's got more
[1:16:38] faith than they thought they
[1:16:41] had come on
[1:16:45] church he said faith is a subconscious
[1:16:48] thing so you don't work up Faith you
[1:16:51] can't sit there say I want more faith I
[1:16:53] want more faith that's not how it works
[1:16:55] faith is just something you believe huh
[1:16:57] it comes by hearing the word what
[1:16:58] happens you hear the word and suddenly
[1:17:00] you just say I know it's right
[1:17:02] yes I know I'm Healed you hear Hebrews

[1:17:08] yesterday today and forever I me cont
[1:17:10] testify of that tonight I I know it's
[1:17:12] real subconscious it's not something you
[1:17:14] work up it's just something you come to
[1:17:17] something that comes that comes to you
[1:17:19] he said people try to he said to look to
[1:17:21] their intellect for Faith When Faith
[1:17:23] doesn't lay in here
[1:17:25] reasons lay here Faith lays in the soul
[1:17:29] he said now that trouble with your foot
[1:17:31] and leg you believe that Jesus Christ
[1:17:32] makes you well you do you accept it
[1:17:34] believe it he said I had a little
[1:17:35] arthritis too but Jesus Christ make you

[1:18:11] gallbladder trouble causing it yes but
[1:18:13] listen what it is really you've got a
[1:18:16] growth on the spine now the doctor had
[1:18:20] told her it was her
[1:18:22] gallbladder you know there's a reason
[1:18:24] they call it practice
[1:18:27] medicine the doctor said it's a
[1:18:30] gallbladder but a prophet not because he
[1:18:33] was who he was but because of the Angel
[1:18:36] of the Lord that that that wanted to
[1:18:38] declare himself to be Elohim wanted to
[1:18:41] declare himself to be God he he spoke
[1:18:44] through him and he said he said you got
[1:18:46] a growth on the spine it's not gadder
[1:18:49] trouble he said ' isn't that right
[1:18:50] that's what's cutting the nerve off it
[1:18:51] isn't the gallbladder he was mistaken on
[1:18:54] that' we take a doctor's word like it's
[1:18:56] like it's the Eternal Word of God we
[1:18:58] ought to quit doing that the doctor
[1:19:00] might have given up on you but God never
[1:19:02] gave up on you the doctor might say it's
[1:19:04] cancer and I believe in doctors I
[1:19:06] believe we should go to doctors but just
[1:19:08] because the doctor says it don't mean
[1:19:09] it's going to happen believe
[1:19:12] [Music]
[1:19:14] God are you with me so

[1:20:30] old mother sitting there he said the the
[1:20:33] lady with her hands on the lady mother
[1:20:34] Bean you did that he said turn your hand
[1:20:36] right back around catch the lady sitting
[1:20:37] behind you she got trouble in her side
[1:20:40] she wants to be healed too one
[1:20:43] service that was repeated hundreds of
[1:20:46] times and many times he told them their
[1:20:47] names their
[1:20:49] addresses where they come from what
[1:20:51] their Town looked like
[1:20:55] told sometimes 15 16 17 levels of
[1:20:59] detail about it what was it for he's
[1:21:03] doing the same thing that God did for
[1:21:07] Abraham look what he said he said see
[1:21:09] when I speak of this one who's come down
[1:21:12] from heaven a gift sent from God I just
[1:21:14] declare him here that's right amen again
[1:21:19] he said you just receive it only thing
[1:21:20] this does is just declare his presence a
[1:21:24] vindication a of him being here now he
[1:21:27] said he would be here right we should
[1:21:29] believe that but to Abraham's seed he
[1:21:32] said at the end time the son of man will
[1:21:34] be revealed what was it God said I'm I'm
[1:21:37] G to I'm G to I'm gon to give you the
[1:21:38] sign of the Messiah brother B said he
[1:21:39] did it to the Gentiles he did it to the
[1:21:41] Samaritans but it had never been done it
[1:21:45] had never been done it wasn't just a
[1:21:48] gift of Prophecy this wasn't just some
[1:21:50] man getting up and and randomly saying
[1:21:52] things until until he gets it right no
[1:21:54] but it was God showing a vision to a
[1:21:56] prophet and in doing that it wasn't even
[1:21:59] a vision like we could have visions or
[1:22:00] dreams that would have to be judge and
[1:22:03] it would have to be interpreted but this
[1:22:04] was not that it was a prophet of God
[1:22:06] standing there with thus sayeth the Lord
[1:22:09] and he stood there and told the people
[1:22:11] and was never
[1:22:14] wrong look what he
[1:22:16] said look what he said he said I will
[1:22:19] declare this that Jesus Christ the same
[1:22:22] great healer that walked the Sea of G
[1:22:24] Galilee is in this building
[1:22:28] now do we really believe that church I
[1:22:31] know it's 3:00 I know that food's
[1:22:33] setting a little heavy but look do you
[1:22:36] really believe it he's in this building
[1:22:38] now fulfilling that it might be
[1:22:39] fulfilled which you spoken by himself
[1:22:41] saying I will be with you even in you to
[1:22:44] the end of the world and the things that
[1:22:45] I do shall you do
[1:22:47] also again he said I declare that Jesus
[1:22:50] Christ raised from the dead and living
[1:22:52] among us today and the very thing things
[1:22:54] that he did then he does tonight in his
[1:22:56] resurrection he looked out upon his
[1:22:58] audience he knew the secrets of their
[1:23:00] hearts is that right he does
[1:23:02] tonight oh my now he said to the
[1:23:04] audience again he said here's a stranger
[1:23:06] I've never seen the man I don't know him
[1:23:07] never seen him God knows that far as I
[1:23:09] know I never seen him in my life but I
[1:23:11] declare that Jesus raised from the dead
[1:23:13] that the same things that Jesus did when
[1:23:14] he was here in a body that you could see
[1:23:16] is right here today doing the same thing
[1:23:19] he has raised from the dead and alive
[1:23:21] forever more blessed are your eyes and
[1:23:24] those who see these things and Believe
[1:23:25] on the Lord Jesus but what did he tell
[1:23:27] Thomas to be more blessed for those that
[1:23:29] have not seen and yet still
[1:23:32] believed but it happened in our
[1:23:39] generation said now let him speak from
[1:23:42] here this powerful statement and declare
[1:23:45] whether he's alive or
[1:23:48] not oh this this gospel is more than
[1:23:51] just word only there power and
[1:23:53] demonstration of the ho Holy
[1:23:56] Spirit brother Bram said there's a
[1:23:58] difference between the appearing of
[1:23:59] Christ and the coming of Christ are you
[1:24:00] still okay I've got just a few more
[1:24:02] minutes and we'll
[1:24:03] close he said there's a difference
[1:24:05] between the appearing of Christ and the
[1:24:06] coming of Christ it's two different
[1:24:08] words he said now is the appearing the
[1:24:11] coming will soon be he's appearing in
[1:24:13] the midst of us doing the works that he
[1:24:16] once did in his church he said now
[1:24:18] you're a part of that church and by
[1:24:21] Grace you believe I am a member of that
[1:24:23] church' he said' no I'm not a preacher
[1:24:25] you know I'm not I have not the
[1:24:26] education to do it sometimes I feel
[1:24:28] reluctant standing here by men of God
[1:24:30] who's called to that office there are
[1:24:32] Apostles prophets teachers pastors
[1:24:35] evangelists not all are Apostles not all
[1:24:36] are prophets not all are teachers not
[1:24:38] all evangelists he said when I'm
[1:24:40] standing here but my
[1:24:43] Ministry is a different Ministry from a
[1:24:47] pastor or teacher I'm not he said if I
[1:24:49] say things wrong Brethren forgive me I
[1:24:51] don't mean it but this is my Ministry to
[1:24:54] declare him that he is here what was
[1:24:58] John the Baptist ministry the same
[1:25:00] Ministry when he stood there in the
[1:25:02] water and he stood and he saw Jesus
[1:25:04] coming and he said Behold the Lamb of
[1:25:06] God who takes away the sin of the world
[1:25:08] and here stands uh here stands the
[1:25:10] Elijah of the end time and he stands in
[1:25:12] the meeting and he says Behold the Lamb
[1:25:14] of God he's
[1:25:16] here hallelujah he's a same yesterday
[1:25:19] today and forever he's going to change
[1:25:21] your body before Abraham could have a
[1:25:23] body change and go back back to where he
[1:25:24] could have a child he had to have an
[1:25:27] appearing there had to be an appearing
[1:25:28] of God in his life oh Church there's got
[1:25:31] to be you got to recognize what God did
[1:25:33] but you also got to recognize what God's
[1:25:35] doing let him speak to you through his
[1:25:39] body
[1:25:40] today
[1:25:41] amen amen listen he was not the only one
[1:25:45] to make a
[1:25:47] declaration are you with me now God
[1:25:50] wants to declare himself through you
[1:25:55] brother BR said when we're born of him
[1:25:56] we're filled with him see your life his
[1:25:58] life is in you then all someone say
[1:26:01] all all our actions should declare him
[1:26:05] he said it was like life like taking
[1:26:07] life out of one tree and putting it in
[1:26:09] another it may look different but the
[1:26:11] life is the
[1:26:12] same he said we have his name we should
[1:26:14] bear his
[1:26:16] name and remember we are now as his
[1:26:18] bride someone say now pregnated with his
[1:26:22] Spirit the church bearing children
[1:26:24] pregnant by his spirit with his name
[1:26:27] bearing his name bearing his life
[1:26:29] bringing forth the signs of his life
[1:26:31] evident with the preeminence evidence of
[1:26:33] his resurrection showing he's not dead
[1:26:36] but he's alive forever more how's he
[1:26:39] doing it today he did that through a
[1:26:41] prophet he don't have to do that again
[1:26:43] that was written in the scripture he
[1:26:45] would do it he does not have to come
[1:26:46] that way again but he did promised to be
[1:26:48] the same yesterday today and forever and
[1:26:51] so if he ever was a Healer he'll be a
