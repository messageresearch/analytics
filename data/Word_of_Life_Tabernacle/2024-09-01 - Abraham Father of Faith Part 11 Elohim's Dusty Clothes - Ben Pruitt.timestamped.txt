[41:33] back with us this morning and we got
[41:34] several gone like I said good to see the
[41:36] perties back with us and the family
[41:38] behind you there God bless you thank you
[41:39] for being here today and you're welcome
[41:43] here I've got a little ringing in my U
[41:46] it's these monitors probably brother
[41:47] Peter but thank you all for being here
[41:50] and I know it's a holiday weekend so we
[41:51] won't hold you all day but I'm just
[41:53] expecting the Lord to do something
[41:55] aren't you amen you believe that this
[41:57] morning God can speak to us through his
[42:00] word amen uh Genesis 18:1 the Lord
[42:03] appeared unto him in the plains of
[42:06] mamory and he sat in the tent Door In
[42:09] the Heat of the day oh I believe it's
[42:12] hot right now but we have a shade tree
[42:15] we can sit under he lift up his eyes and
[42:18] looked and lo three men stood by him
[42:22] when he saw them he ran to meet them
[42:24] from the tent door and bowed himself
[42:26] toward the ground and said my Lord if
[42:30] now I have found favor in thy sight pass
[42:34] not away I pray thee from thy servant
[42:37] let a little water I pray you be fetched
[42:40] and wash your feet and rest yourselves
[42:42] under the
[42:44] tree I will fetch a morsel of bread and
[42:46] comfort you your hearts after that you
[42:49] shall pass on for therefore are you come
[42:52] to your servant and they said so do as
[42:56] thou Hast said pray the Lord would add
[42:57] his Blessing to the word you may be
[42:59] seated I want to speak to you this
[43:01] morning on Abram Abraham's Dusty clothes
[43:06] Abraham's Dusty clothes Peter you may
[43:09] have to restart
[43:11] that I took a trip
[43:14] to
[43:16] Jeffersonville uh to go to Sister
[43:19] Carol's funeral memorial service there
[43:21] and while I was there I we went by the
[43:25] Tabernacle we wanted to go see brother
[43:26] Billy Paul's Gra and and so we went by
[43:28] the Tabernacle which is very close and
[43:30] as we drove by um I I was struck again I
[43:34] hadn't seen it in in several years and I
[43:37] was struck again at how uh common that
[43:41] it was and and how small it was and the
[43:45] Tabernacle the building that brother
[43:47] Brandon preached in is not much bigger
[43:49] than this one and so uh you begin to
[43:52] look at that and and and they pack a
[43:54] bunch of people in there but it's just
[43:56] not big it's not
[43:57] flashy on my way through Jeffersonville
[44:00] I saw a headquarters of a denomination
[44:03] I've never heard of some group and some
[44:05] Pentecostal group it looked like and
[44:07] they had big letters across the
[44:09] headquarters of it and it showed the uh
[44:12] the buildings and all that was there and
[44:14] I thought well I've never even heard of
[44:15] them and and it looks like they've got
[44:18] uh a larger beginning at least than what
[44:21] the message did and I begin to look at
[44:24] that and begin to think about it you
[44:25] know uh sometimes we don't realize what
[44:28] the message has become as far as the
[44:29] message people but there's message
[44:32] people everywhere people who claim to
[44:33] believe the message and and many of them
[44:36] do I've been to churches all over the
[44:37] world that are just like us and believe
[44:41] many of the same things that you and I
[44:42] believe and and and and preach it and
[44:46] and and declare it and I've been in
[44:49] churches in the Philippines and in Asia
[44:51] I've been in the churches in Africa I've
[44:53] seen churches in Europe I've been in
[44:55] churches in in North America and Canada
[44:58] and everywhere I've been I've seen
[45:00] people who love the Lord and and who
[45:02] believe this message and and they're
[45:05] they're all over the place and uh a lot
[45:07] of people don't realize that there's
[45:08] more messaged people than there are
[45:10] Churches of Christ or
[45:13] Presbyterians or missionary Baptists
[45:15] which is the denomination that brother
[45:17] brandom come out of and yet uh you look
[45:21] at it it's it's it's decentralized
[45:23] there's not a lot of hype about it and
[45:27] brother brandham when he was here he he
[45:29] come in in a in a very simple way he
[45:32] conducted himself in in a way he said
[45:34] that he could preach to to 300,000 or he
[45:37] could preach to three people and he
[45:39] purposely did it that way and and so I
[45:42] was uh I was struck by that and brother
[45:44] Brenham tells the story of how that he
[45:46] went to Tulsa and when he was in Tulsa
[45:49] in
[45:50] 1960 he saw the the headquarters of or
[45:52] Roberts and Tommy Osburn and if you went
[45:56] to Tulsa years ago you probably saw that
[45:58] I think Tommy Osborne's uh headquarters
[46:01] has been torn down when they widened i44
[46:03] and and but I saw it as a kid and I
[46:06] think uh uh uh Oral Roberts headquarters
[46:09] is now being torn down or has been torn
[46:12] down but I had pictures of that when we
[46:14] get it back up maybe we'll show you
[46:16] brother bandam talked about it and he
[46:17] said when I I seen that solid marble
[46:20] building he said not a window in it
[46:22] nowhere but how it was fixed he said
[46:24] I've been in Hollywood and I've been in
[46:26] King palaces but he said I've never seen
[46:28] anything that would compare to that and
[46:32] he said I stood on the outside and
[46:33] looked back at the building and I and
[46:35] and you can imagine how he must have
[46:36] felt now this was in around 1960 when
[46:40] brother Brandon is being
[46:41] investigated by the IRS because people
[46:44] didn't handle the finances right and as
[46:46] far as they wrote checks to him
[46:48] personally instead of writing them to
[46:50] the church and so brother Brandon was
[46:51] going to owe a bunch of taxes and and so
[46:54] he's going through a lot right then he's
[46:56] got a lot going on on and you can look
[46:58] at the picture that's a picture of the
[46:59] Tabernacle buildings and the first
[47:02] Tabernacle brother brandom had and and
[47:04] the the middle one is the uh a few years
[47:06] later the newer Tabernacle up to the 60s
[47:09] and then the new one is the new building
[47:10] I think I've got a picture of the
[47:11] building more like it is today now
[47:13] they've added another section onto it
[47:16] but it's actually not a a great big
[47:18] place it's very very simple and it
[47:20] doesn't look very very Grand and and if
[47:23] you go to that next picture I think
[47:24] there's a picture of that's oral
[47:26] Robert's headqu
[47:27] there's no comparison to it at all and
[47:30] and it's very very large it was very
[47:32] very ornate and even back in the 50s
[47:35] when it was built it was worth millions
[47:37] of dollars and brother Brandon begins to
[47:39] feel sorry for himself and and and he
[47:41] gets to begin to think a little bit low
[47:43] and and he's comparing himself and I
[47:45] think I had Tommy osburn's headquarters
[47:47] on there as well and what it looked like
[47:49] and he be to feel sorry for himself and
[47:52] begin to think well I started their
[47:54] Ministries and he did the reason or
[47:57] Roberts was here is because he saw what
[47:59] brother brandham was doing and reason
[48:01] Tommy osbor was there he went to a
[48:03] meeting of brother brandom's and he
[48:04] would even attribute it to that and and
[48:07] so he began to think oh God maybe I'm
[48:09] not worthy and he said just in a little
[48:11] voice come down through the corridors as
[48:13] he was standing there in in or Robert's
[48:15] building he said but I am your portion
[48:19] and brother brandham said it like this
[48:20] he said if you're he said if you're my
[48:22] portion that's enough I want to say
[48:25] that's still true today God is our
[48:27] portion that's enough and yet this
[48:30] message has had a much greater impact on
[48:32] the world than or Robert's message did
[48:34] or or uh maybe uh some of the other
[48:37] messengers of that time it's had a much
[48:39] greater impact and as far as the word
[48:42] message that's went forth and the people
[48:43] that believe it but I'll say this to you
[48:45] this morning don't despise the day of
[48:47] small things don't think just because
[48:50] something is little or because it's
[48:51] humble or because there's not a lot of
[48:53] people in church on a Sunday morning
[48:55] don't begin to think think that it's not
[48:57] going to be God in that that God can't
[48:59] move through that because sometimes God
[49:01] shows up in human form and sometimes God
[49:05] shows up with dust on his
[49:11] clothes we established last week that
[49:14] Elohim came down and visited Abraham
[49:19] brother brand said it was the almighty
[49:21] God of Genesis 17 that came down in a
[49:25] body remember he said he just blew like
[49:28] that and it become a body of Flesh and
[49:31] he breathed into it and it was the it
[49:33] was God Elohim he said the flesh wasn't
[49:37] Elohim but the spirit in him was Elohim
[49:41] and Elohim actually walked up to
[49:44] Abraham's tent he appeared before him
[49:48] listen what the scripture says he lifted
[49:50] up his eyes and looked and lo three men
[49:53] stood by him it's Elohim and two angels
[49:56] and when he saw them he ran to meet them
[49:59] from the tent door and bowed himself
[50:03] toward the ground now brother brand said
[50:05] watch the son of man was revealed to
[50:07] Abraham's group as a man a prophet in a
[50:09] form of human flesh an ordinary man with
[50:12] dust on his clothes and Abraham called
[50:15] him Elohim he said now Jesus promises
[50:18] here that in the last days the son of
[50:20] man will be revealed again to that same
[50:22] type of group oyal Seed of Abraham just
[50:25] before the fire falls what type of group
[50:27] will it be a group of Believers because
[50:30] Abraham had believed God for 25 years
[50:32] he'd held on to the promise of God he
[50:35] said so God was going to reveal himself
[50:36] to a group like that to that kind of a
[50:39] group just before the fire falls
[50:40] remember he said the church never
[50:42] received any more witness Abraham and
[50:44] them didn't the promised son that they
[50:46] were looking for was brought right away
[50:49] after that so in other words there
[50:50] wasn't any more sign that they would
[50:52] receive that would tell them that the
[50:54] Rapture was coming the body change was
[50:56] coming the pro promised son was coming
[50:57] but Jeff this was it that was the last
[50:59] sign they would receive before the
[51:01] change of the body he said and the
[51:03] church is looking for the promised son
[51:05] he will come right after the days of
[51:07] this ministry he'll be revealed from the
[51:10] heavens now brother random always
[51:13] identifies him when he come with dust on
[51:16] his clothes now if you've listened to it
[51:19] and you and it struck me as I went down
[51:20] and read through quote after quote and
[51:23] sermon after sermon brother ROM always
[51:25] identifies him this way he said we're uh
[51:28] he talks about it he said we're
[51:29] strangers said we've come from a foreign
[51:31] country their clothes were
[51:34] Dusty and again they just appeared in
[51:36] front of
[51:37] him right because the Bible says that
[51:39] they uh he L lifted up his eyes and
[51:41] there they were right and maybe there
[51:44] was a road that went by where Abraham's
[51:46] tent was and he just sitting there in
[51:48] the tent door and as he sat there I'm
[51:50] going going to sit down and preach but
[51:52] when he sat there he he he sat there and
[51:53] he just kind of pondering on the day and
[51:55] what's going on thinking about the
[51:57] things of the Lord and In the Heat of
[51:59] the day taking a break from his work and
[52:01] he's sitting there sweating you know and
[52:03] In the Heat of the day thankful for the
[52:05] shade tree that he has and as he sits
[52:07] there suddenly he he looked up and oh
[52:11] three men now if you saw three men
[52:13] what's the first thing that you would
[52:14] think well who are they where do they
[52:17] come from and he saw when he saw them
[52:21] they looked like they'd come from
[52:22] another place they looked like they come
[52:26] down a dusty road they look like every
[52:28] other traveler on that road look like
[52:32] but Abraham recognized there was
[52:34] something different about them so the
[52:37] dust on the clothes oh Church the dust
[52:40] on the clothes would have hidden deity
[52:43] from a normal
[52:46] person from any other type of person the
[52:49] dust on the clothes would have been
[52:51] proof this couldn't be God because if it
[52:54] was God he' come from another dimension
[52:56] he come if he come down from heaven how
[52:58] did he get dust on his clothes but
[53:00] Abraham didn't try to solve the mystery
[53:02] of the
[53:03] Dust oh I hope you hear me today I got
[53:06] questions this week and uh things that
[53:08] people are dealing with in the message
[53:09] people on the internet trying to put
[53:11] down on the message about well brother
[53:13] brandham was here and he was here and
[53:15] and why wasn't it bigger and why didn't
[53:17] he do this and someone asked me did
[53:18] Brother brandham really travel seven
[53:20] times around the world and I said well
[53:21] not in sh not in a straight
[53:23] line right and yet he went seven times
[53:27] he said about around the world but he
[53:29] was saying just about how far he'd been
[53:31] but people what is it there's dust on it
[53:34] there's dust on the messenger there's
[53:36] dust on the message there's dust on
[53:37] God's people there's dirt that people
[53:40] have been throwing on the message and I
[53:42] want you to know this morning we got to
[53:43] be able to look past that dirt and
[53:46] Abraham was the type of a man brother
[53:47] the story that he could look past the
[53:49] dust on the clothes that that Elohim had
[53:52] and see there's something real about him
[53:55] right
[53:57] oh Church it looked like they'd come
[53:59] from a foreign country in fact the dust
[54:01] to an unbeliever would have been proof
[54:03] it wasn't
[54:06] real to an unbeliever the dust is is
[54:10] proof that there's no God in it but to
[54:15] Abraham it just meant God was hiding
[54:19] himself Hallelujah imagine them coming
[54:22] down you know they're coming down and
[54:24] they got dust on their clothes and be
[54:25] like these three young men here we'd
[54:27] expect them to have dust on their
[54:28] clothes if they were out playing but you
[54:30] wouldn't expect God to have dust on his
[54:33] clothes right you wouldn't expect God to
[54:36] come down in that kind of a form but
[54:38] that's the way he came right right he
[54:41] come down walk in a dusty road with dust
[54:43] on his clothes I don't know how it got
[54:44] there I don't know I don't know if he
[54:46] because brother R say he just appeared
[54:47] the Bible speaks as if he just appeared
[54:49] there I don't know if he went down
[54:50] around the bend and and and they all
[54:52] dumped dust on themselves and then went
[54:54] around I don't know I don't know how
[54:56] that happened I I don't know if it was
[54:57] Supernatural dust but again Abraham
[55:00] didn't try to solve the mystery of the
[55:01] dust that wasn't his job his job was to
[55:05] recognize so Church it is not our job to
[55:08] solve the mystery of the Dust it's not
[55:10] our job to try to try to analyze
[55:12] everything and and legalize everything
[55:15] and make everybody the same that's not
[55:17] our job but to see past the dust to see
[55:21] deity it's a challenge it'll take
[55:23] somebody with faith predestined to
[55:26] believe it do you believe that today and
[55:28] look he said he kept looking down to
[55:31] them he said these are strange fellows
[55:33] they're
[55:34] Dusty traveled far they did From Another
[55:39] Dimension oh he said when he set him
[55:42] down there he said though they didn't
[55:43] look any different from any other men
[55:45] because they were dressed dust on their
[55:48] clothes come from some other country
[55:51] probably their feet Dusty and their
[55:54] clothes ragged
[55:56] H imagine God coming down and
[56:00] purposefully he had to do it on purpose
[56:02] because he could have put himself in any
[56:03] kind of close he could have looked like
[56:05] brother Joel he could have looked like
[56:06] me and maybe not but he could have
[56:08] looked he could have dressed himself
[56:11] good worn a suit and tie wore a turban
[56:14] wore a a great kingly robe that's how he
[56:17] could have come right and there were
[56:19] times he come as MDC he come he come in
[56:22] different forms and different ways but
[56:24] but here he come with dust on his
[56:26] clothes
[56:27] with dust on his clothes looking like he
[56:28] was from another country look like he
[56:31] traveled a long time he'd come
[56:33] hungry Elohim oh God Elohim created a
[56:38] body that was automatically
[56:42] hungry think about it it' just been
[56:45] created a few minutes before and he
[56:48] create church he created himself a body
[56:51] that was hungry he created himself a
[56:54] body with dirt on his feet yeah dust on
[56:58] his
[56:59] clothes look he said dust on their
[57:01] clothes come from some other country
[57:03] probably their feet Dusty in their
[57:04] clothes ragging Abraham knew inside
[57:06] there there was something real the
[57:08] spirit declared it why he kept now
[57:10] listen how could he see it he kept
[57:12] himself in a spiritual atmosphere all
[57:15] the time many times the reason we can't
[57:17] see things is because we don't keep
[57:19] ourselves in a spiritual atmosphere but
[57:21] he said he kept himself in a spiritual
[57:23] atmosphere all the time that he could
[57:25] recognize right from wrong all the time
[57:29] listen to me young people you need to
[57:30] keep yourselves in a spiritual
[57:32] atmosphere so you can recognize right
[57:34] and wrong you won't always have to have
[57:36] somebody tell you what's right and wrong
[57:38] but you can recognize right and wrong
[57:40] why you read your Bible that morning you
[57:41] prayed that morning you can recognize
[57:44] right from
[57:45] wrong and you're going to have to be
[57:47] able cuz many times the a the the devil
[57:49] appears as an angel of Light but you got
[57:51] to be able to recognize that's not him
[57:53] and when God Appears when Elohim comes
[57:56] down down but he comes with Dusty
[57:57] clothes on you got to be able to
[57:59] recognize that
[58:01] too right are you with me
[58:04] now you said brother Ben you're far out
[58:06] there I no I'm I'm really
[58:10] not look brother brandham says it about
[58:14] Dusty clothes and you can you can go
[58:15] find it in the message prob dozens maybe
[58:17] hundreds of times brother brandham talks
[58:20] about dust on their clothes why did he
[58:22] keep telling us
[58:23] that where does he get it Genesis 8
[58:26] 183 look what Abraham said he said my
[58:29] Lord my Lord's my
[58:32] Lord if now I have found favor in thy
[58:35] sight pass not away I pray thee from thy
[58:39] servant words they look like they were
[58:41] just going to continue on that's the way
[58:42] he comes many times that's until he come
[58:45] to those on the road to emus it says he
[58:47] made as if he was going to go on down
[58:49] the road they constrained him compelled
[58:52] him to come in many times he he acts
[58:55] like he's just passing through and the
[58:56] service is just going to be another
[58:58] service and it seems like it's just
[58:59] going to be another day but sometimes we
[59:02] just got to compel him to stay Lord how
[59:04] can I make you welcome how can I
[59:05] entertain you how can I make this
[59:07] service better than the last one how can
[59:09] I make this this time with you how can I
[59:11] make my prayer time a moment where you
[59:13] can stay with me all of the day and he
[59:17] wants to he he has a desire to stay but
[59:19] he won't force himself on you right he
[59:22] had a desire he had a word to get to
[59:25] Abraham oh my but he had to Abraham had
[59:28] to invite him
[59:29] in said pass not away from thy servant
[59:33] let a little water I pray you be
[59:37] fetched now watch what he's doing this
[59:39] is where brother BR gets the dust on his
[59:41] clothes right he wash your feet if he
[59:45] had dust on his feet he must have had
[59:46] dust on his
[59:49] clothes he needed his feet wash and rest
[59:53] yourselves under the
[59:57] tree oh
[59:59] my here's our church
[1:00:01] Lord I hope you're hear me this morning
[1:00:05] I know it's Labor Day weekend and not
[1:00:06] everybody's here but could we just could
[1:00:07] we just break down for a minute and just
[1:00:09] kind of let the barriers go a little bit
[1:00:10] and just have church for a minute this
[1:00:14] is our church lord it's all we got to
[1:00:15] offer just a tree it's not
[1:00:18] perfect but it's one you
[1:00:21] restored it's a tree built by the
[1:00:23] message of the hour it's one you
[1:00:25] restored Lord this is our tree Lord
[1:00:27] would you come in I'll wash the dirt off
[1:00:30] of you brother BR in one place he said
[1:00:32] he dusted off elohim's
[1:00:35] clothes he dusted his clothes off and
[1:00:37] washed his feet and the Bible says he
[1:00:40] stood there and watched him meat ran out
[1:00:43] and got the calf and and and watched him
[1:00:46] eat cornbread and H cakes he said and
[1:00:48] and those things what was it it was God
[1:00:50] B him invited in and so when he was
[1:00:55] invited in stayed and I think all of us
[1:00:58] need to hear from God we need to hear
[1:01:00] the word of the lord we need to hear a
[1:01:01] direct Revelation from God if we're ever
[1:01:03] going to make a body change there's
[1:01:05] something we need to hear and we need to
[1:01:06] hear what Abraham or we need to hear the
[1:01:08] message of the hour but we can only hear
[1:01:10] it in the right atmosphere it's got to
[1:01:12] be under the shade tree it's got to be
[1:01:14] in the door of the tent it's got to be
[1:01:16] in the heat of the day it's got to be
[1:01:17] when Elohim comes by and we invite him
[1:01:20] to
[1:01:21] stay I send him on down the road not
[1:01:24] rush to the service so we can get done
[1:01:26] whatever we want to get done but let's
[1:01:27] stay Elohim I believe it's you I can see
[1:01:31] past the musicians I can see past the
[1:01:33] preacher I can see Pastor deacons I
[1:01:35] believe it's you
[1:01:36] Elohim I want you to
[1:01:41] stay oh
[1:01:43] church this just been on my heart ever
[1:01:46] since I W I drove by the Tabernacle and
[1:01:48] I saw the dust on that
[1:01:50] building I thought God there's dust on
[1:01:52] your
[1:01:53] clothes but it's still you
[1:02:03] it wasn't the angel the Lord Brother
[1:02:04] brand said that was God
[1:02:07] himself Abraham said it was he had on
[1:02:09] clothes like a man dust all over him
[1:02:11] come from a far country but Abraham saw
[1:02:15] God face to face there why he went out
[1:02:18] and look what he did he eat meat Abraham
[1:02:21] went and killed a calf B brought some
[1:02:22] butter out and Sarah needed some bread
[1:02:25] made some H cakes brought it out the
[1:02:27] almighty with dust on his clothes sat
[1:02:30] down and eat a calf and drinking milk
[1:02:32] and eat hot
[1:02:34] cakes oh
[1:02:35] my listen before Abraham could receive
[1:02:38] this promise he had to wash the dirt off
[1:02:41] the feet of
[1:02:43] Elohim if we're going to receive a body
[1:02:46] change I believe we're looking forward
[1:02:47] to that aren't we I trust that we all
[1:02:49] are we first got to wash the dirt off of
[1:02:52] this message all right I think maybe if
[1:02:54] we would entertain him a little bit more
[1:02:56] if we'd wash the dirt off of his feet if
[1:02:58] we'd make him feel welcome maybe our
[1:03:00] kids would understand that that that
[1:03:03] this is a place they need to be too
[1:03:05] where Elohim is speaking it's not
[1:03:07] someplace we just go once in a while
[1:03:08] when we feel like it but it's some place
[1:03:10] that Elohim speaks to us sometimes and
[1:03:13] and even our prayer closets the same way
[1:03:15] it's not just the church but when we're
[1:03:17] at home and when we're praying we're
[1:03:18] calling out to God let it be a place
[1:03:20] that's special a place that this is
[1:03:23] where I meet God I can meet him anywhere
[1:03:25] but let meet him here yes at the
[1:03:27] appointed time all right come on oh my
[1:03:31] wash the dirt off of it don't make it
[1:03:34] look like well that's just a bunch of
[1:03:35] crazy people a bunch of Holy Rollers a
[1:03:37] bunch of message people up there we
[1:03:38] shouldn't talk about the message that
[1:03:40] way to our
[1:03:41] children huh we got a great message we
[1:03:44] should learn to be positive about it we
[1:03:46] should be able to look past the dust on
[1:03:48] the yeah there's a lot of crazies yeah
[1:03:50] there's a lot of Cults yeah there's a
[1:03:51] lot of nonsense but there's something
[1:03:52] real on the
[1:03:54] inside there's something something real
[1:03:56] down on the inside of Word of Life
[1:03:57] Tabernacle there something real in Hardy
[1:03:59] Arkansas there's something real in the
[1:04:00] message of the
[1:04:03] hour it's not just dirt got to wash that
[1:04:06] dirt off
[1:04:09] yes one time one of Abraham's
[1:04:12] seed was caught in a condition of life
[1:04:15] where she was a
[1:04:16] prostitute but she was still Abraham's
[1:04:19] seed brother Bron she hadd been turned
[1:04:20] out by her parents but she was still
[1:04:22] Abraham's
[1:04:24] seed and one of the
[1:04:26] Pharisees desired him that he would eat
[1:04:29] with him and he went into the Pharisees
[1:04:31] house sat down to me he invited him but
[1:04:33] he didn't do like Abraham he didn't make
[1:04:35] him feel
[1:04:37] welcome Oh my he said behold a woman in
[1:04:40] the city which was a sinner when she
[1:04:42] knew that Jesus said at me and the
[1:04:43] Pharisees house brought an alabaster box
[1:04:46] of ointment and stood At His Feet behind
[1:04:49] him weeping and began to wash his feet
[1:04:52] with tears and did wipe them with the
[1:04:54] hairs of her head and kissed his feet
[1:04:56] and anointed them with the or what was
[1:04:58] it it was Abraham or it was Elohim
[1:05:01] rather again and Abraham seed a face
[1:05:05] seed Royal seed recognized that Elohim
[1:05:09] was back in flesh and his clothes were
[1:05:11] Dusty and his feet were dirty but she
[1:05:13] said I'm going to do something about
[1:05:15] that I'm going to look past that I'm
[1:05:17] going to do something about that I'm G
[1:05:18] to make sure that my kids know or
[1:05:21] something about this
[1:05:22] message just because it was delivered in
[1:05:25] the shell
[1:05:26] of
[1:05:27] dust doesn't mean that there's not
[1:05:31] Supernatural in it
[1:05:36] right she had to do a service for him
[1:05:39] she looked at him you all know the story
[1:05:41] brother Brandon preach it many times the
[1:05:42] unwelcome Christ the meanest man in the
[1:05:45] city The Pride preach it many different
[1:05:50] ways and and he said she had to do a
[1:05:52] service for him she had heard of him
[1:05:55] that's what Abraham was doing she'd seen
[1:05:57] him with her eyes she had a service to
[1:05:59] do she had nothing to do it with and I
[1:06:03] think many times that's what stops us
[1:06:04] from from worshiping because we feel
[1:06:06] like well I just don't have the
[1:06:07] qualifications or I'm not a piano player
[1:06:10] I'm not a I'm not a a drummer I'm not a
[1:06:13] preacher I'll just sit back and and
[1:06:17] I'll and I'll just watch and I'll just
[1:06:19] see what goes on but but many times that
[1:06:22] keeps us from worship say well I got
[1:06:24] nothing to do it with well didn't
[1:06:26] either he just there was something
[1:06:28] needed done and all she had she went and
[1:06:31] bought that out she spent all of her
[1:06:32] money buy an alabaster box of ointment
[1:06:35] That's All She had she didn't have money
[1:06:37] to buy she didn't have any extra to buy
[1:06:39] a basin or or get some water or buy a ra
[1:06:43] even a rag to wash his feet with so
[1:06:45] brother brandom tells us that she had
[1:06:47] nothing to do it with so she rushed
[1:06:50] forward
[1:06:51] anyhow even though she didn't feel
[1:06:53] qualified even though she oh Church she
[1:06:56] didn't feel like that she'd be able to
[1:06:58] do it if you knew how unqualified I felt
[1:07:00] to stand in this Pulpit this morning if
[1:07:02] you knew how unqualified many times
[1:07:04] these ministers these men of God who'd
[1:07:06] stand here feel you'd feel like well
[1:07:08] you'd say well why did they even go but
[1:07:10] it's because there's a service that
[1:07:11] needs to be done he wants his feet
[1:07:15] washed there's dust on him and I'll do
[1:07:19] everything I can to keep the message
[1:07:20] clean keep the dust off yeah if I can
[1:07:24] preach and do that if I can sit in the
[1:07:25] Pew and do that if I can pay my tith and
[1:07:27] do that if I can go to church and do
[1:07:29] that whatever it takes let me do it with
[1:07:31] all of my
[1:07:33] heart if raising my hands if that's all
[1:07:37] I have that's what he wants yes see he
[1:07:40] didn't want oh church he didn't want
[1:07:43] water from Pharisees house he wanted the
[1:07:47] tears from her
[1:07:50] eyes he didn't want a a great Egyptian
[1:07:55] towel
[1:07:56] that that they could wipe his feet with
[1:07:57] he wanted the hair on her head he
[1:07:59] doesn't want so he doesn't want your
[1:08:01] gifts he doesn't want your your
[1:08:03] abilities he wants
[1:08:07] you he wants you he wants
[1:08:10] me she recognize a
[1:08:12] service needs to be done Abraham
[1:08:14] recognize there's a service that needs
[1:08:16] to be done I see something more in this
[1:08:19] man than just a man I'm going to wash
[1:08:21] his
[1:08:22] feet brother BR said she had heard of a
[1:08:24] living God all over life but now she's
[1:08:27] seen him with her eyes she knew it was
[1:08:29] him an inspiration struck her and she
[1:08:31] said this is the
[1:08:33] messenger oh
[1:08:35] church he needed a service she had
[1:08:39] nothing to serve him by his feet was
[1:08:41] dirty but she rushed forward anyhow to
[1:08:43] do him a service because she was
[1:08:46] inspired to do it you say well I would
[1:08:48] do that for Jesus but the way you treat
[1:08:50] the body of Christ today is the way you
[1:08:53] would have treated the body of Christ
[1:08:55] then
[1:08:56] because it's veiled in the same
[1:09:02] way Abraham wasn't
[1:09:04] embarrassed to wash his
[1:09:07] feet I wonder if we're embarrassed
[1:09:10] sometimes I wonder where our willingness
[1:09:12] is and I'm not rebuking you this morning
[1:09:14] I'm preaching to myself to my children
[1:09:17] to my home to the people that that want
[1:09:19] to hear it where's our willingness to do
[1:09:22] whatever we can for the message of the
[1:09:24] hour you're not do doing it for me and
[1:09:26] I've always looked at it like that
[1:09:27] church and I think it's a mistake to
[1:09:29] look at it as doing it for the
[1:09:31] church we're doing it for the body of
[1:09:34] Christ and that's not just in Hardy
[1:09:36] Arkansas that's everywhere but we should
[1:09:39] focus on our own church first I believe
[1:09:40] that but but the body of Christ is
[1:09:42] everywhere it's spread over the world we
[1:09:44] don't we don't just we don't just love
[1:09:46] people who love us we don't just
[1:09:48] fellowship with people who fellowship
[1:09:49] with us we don't just reach out to
[1:09:51] people who reach out to us we don't just
[1:09:53] be kind to people who've been kind to us
[1:09:55] Jesus said even the publicans the tax
[1:09:57] collectors can do that he said but what
[1:09:59] about reaching out to somebody who asked
[1:10:02] you to go a mile and you go with him too
[1:10:04] who who ask of your coat and you give
[1:10:06] him your your shirt
[1:10:09] too where is our willingness to do
[1:10:11] whatever we can you say well it's not
[1:10:14] much don't let that stop you God will
[1:10:17] use you like he did her like he did
[1:10:21] Abraham see the guests didn't know him
[1:10:24] BR said they was ashamed of him because
[1:10:26] he's dirty that's the way it is today
[1:10:28] they're still ashamed of him because
[1:10:29] they pile all the dirt that they can
[1:10:31] upon it call it holy rollers and
[1:10:33] everything else they can think of nobody
[1:10:35] does nothing about it Mary says Dirty
[1:10:38] Feet Wallflower at the
[1:10:42] party they might have had music they
[1:10:44] might have had dancing they might have
[1:10:46] had entertainment they might have had
[1:10:47] singing but Jesus was a Wallflower at
[1:10:50] the party let me say this as long as
[1:10:52] we're here we ought to make him the
[1:10:53] guest of honor as long as we're here we
[1:10:55] ought to make him the center of
[1:10:56] attention as long as we're here we ought
[1:10:58] to worship him with all of our heart who
[1:11:00] is he he's the word let the word excite
[1:11:03] you let it do something in your heart
[1:11:06] it'll be the word that heals you it'll
[1:11:08] be the word that changes your body it'll
[1:11:10] be the word that's what that was what
[1:11:11] was important it wasn't even the body
[1:11:13] that he created out of dust but it was
[1:11:15] the word yes sir it was the word that
[1:11:17] Elohim brought to Abraham and said in a
[1:11:19] year at the time of life Sarah's going
[1:11:21] to have a son and your body's going to
[1:11:23] be changed back it was the word that
[1:11:25] come in our day wasn't just a man was a
[1:11:28] word come in a body of Flesh not in that
[1:11:31] body that body was Christ Jesus Christ
[1:11:33] the son of God this man was born of a
[1:11:35] woman but he was part of the bride God
[1:11:40] come and manifest himself in but let me
[1:11:41] go a step further we did last week God
[1:11:44] didn't just stop there but he wanted to
[1:11:45] manifest the son of man in you and
[1:11:47] me that's what a prophet told
[1:11:50] us
[1:11:52] look he said invited we asked him to to
[1:11:55] come for a Revival when he comes we
[1:11:57] treat him the same way they did there he
[1:11:59] come and identified himself but nobody
[1:12:01] wants nothing to do with him see if he
[1:12:04] could pull some kind of a gimmick or do
[1:12:07] some kind of a miracle like he did
[1:12:08] before Pilate the only opportunity he
[1:12:11] ever had and he asked him wanting to see
[1:12:14] something done Wanted let's see some
[1:12:16] sign he ought to have repented you
[1:12:18] realize Jesus had the power to deliver
[1:12:20] himself just by doing a
[1:12:23] sign all all he had to do was stand
[1:12:25] there and reveal the secrets of Pilot's
[1:12:27] heart and he knew what pilot was
[1:12:30] thinking and all he had to do was
[1:12:33] perform and pilate would have stood
[1:12:35] there with him and said he's God In the
[1:12:37] Flesh he is the Son of God all he had to
[1:12:41] do was do a sign for Herod yeah but he's
[1:12:45] not a circus
[1:12:48] clown that's not what he is that's not
[1:12:50] what church ought to be he's not a show
[1:12:53] what was he was God the word in flesh
[1:12:55] and he had a job to do that was die for
[1:12:57] the sins of the people he had a job to
[1:13:00] do that was die for my sin and your sin
[1:13:02] right so he remained
[1:13:05] silent oh Church pilate said let's see
[1:13:08] some sign he said he ought to have
[1:13:09] repented that's what this cruel
[1:13:11] Hellbound World ought to do tonight is
[1:13:12] repent of their sins he said that's what
[1:13:15] these church members ought to do repent
[1:13:16] of their unbelief stand up for him he's
[1:13:19] a same yesterday today and forever and
[1:13:20] he identifies himself just like he did
[1:13:23] then and the people today take the same
[1:13:24] at attitude as that Pharisee took same
[1:13:26] kind of attitude let let him sit after
[1:13:29] inviting him yet they don't want him
[1:13:31] they just do it like for manners in
[1:13:33] other words just to be nice he knows it
[1:13:37] we done to him today just like they did
[1:13:39] then instead of washing him washing
[1:13:41] their reproach away instead of trying to
[1:13:43] stand up saying you're mistaken it's the
[1:13:45] word of God made manifest I say it's
[1:13:47] time we stood up for this message it's
[1:13:49] time we stood up for one another it's
[1:13:50] time we stood up for the power of God
[1:13:53] it's time we stood up for Holiness it's
[1:13:54] time we stood up for the Holy Ghost
[1:13:58] right anybody can criticize it's
[1:14:01] easy where is somebody who will stand up
[1:14:05] I still believe in the Holy Ghost I
[1:14:07] still believe in the move of the spirit
[1:14:08] I still believe in the message of the
[1:14:10] hour
[1:14:12] yes it's what he promised he said he
[1:14:14] would pour out the spirit in the last
[1:14:15] days we're living in the last days
[1:14:17] instead of that we're just kind of set
[1:14:18] back like they did we're afraid to take
[1:14:19] a stand what if one of them would have
[1:14:22] raised up and said that's Jesus of
[1:14:23] Nazareth I believe he's a prophet of God
[1:14:25] he said you know the reason they didn't
[1:14:26] do it because they didn't believe he was
[1:14:27] a prophet right
[1:14:30] yeah that's something isn't it that's
[1:14:33] the same thing he's in question about
[1:14:35] today look how look how preent this is
[1:14:38] to our age look what they're trying to
[1:14:40] cast out on brother Brandon being a
[1:14:42] prophet they're trying to say his
[1:14:44] prophecy wasn't true even though they
[1:14:46] got no ground to stand on but that's
[1:14:47] what they're trying to say they just say
[1:14:50] well I haven't got nothing to do with
[1:14:51] him I belong to church there's my
[1:14:53] pastors all them sitting around there
[1:14:55] I'm a good person Jesus with dirty feet
[1:14:59] nobody cared now
[1:15:01] listen I wonder again how would we
[1:15:03] receive him and how we would receive him
[1:15:05] then is how we receive him today right
[1:15:08] the same way we receive the message of
[1:15:09] the hour today is the same way we would
[1:15:11] have received him then there's there's
[1:15:14] he was just as hidden to them as he is
[1:15:17] to people today right as he is in you as
[1:15:20] he is in your wife as he is in your
[1:15:22] children as he is in the preacher yeah
[1:15:25] he's just as hidden yeah right just as
[1:15:28] hidden and and if you would have went
[1:15:30] back then you would have looked and you
[1:15:32] would have seen things that maybe we in
[1:15:34] the scripture we look at it we kind of
[1:15:35] gloss over it but when you went there
[1:15:36] you'd have seen him
[1:15:38] eat and you'd have seen him sleep yeah
[1:15:42] and you'd have seen him in
[1:15:44] poverty and you'd have seen him not
[1:15:46] begin preaching till he was 30 years old
[1:15:48] yeah and why didn't he do anything
[1:15:51] earlier there have been all kinds of
[1:15:53] reasons to criticize that went to raise
[1:15:55] Lazarus he didn't show up on time he's a
[1:15:57] bad
[1:16:01] pastor he's not he don't recognize the
[1:16:03] people's needs but he was led by the
[1:16:05] will of
[1:16:06] God right but you see that what what
[1:16:09] people are doing there's always going to
[1:16:10] be something to criticize and I thank
[1:16:12] God for this church that you're not a
[1:16:13] criticizing a bunch of people but if you
[1:16:15] want something to criticize there's lots
[1:16:17] more I get amused sometimes because if
[1:16:19] you really knew me you'd have much more
[1:16:21] to criticize than you do now
[1:16:25] and I think all of us could say
[1:16:27] that right because we're human we're
[1:16:30] wrapped in flesh we got dust on our
[1:16:34] clothes but look at the dust is
[1:16:37] Humanity it's
[1:16:39] Humanity in Genesis 2 chapter or verse 7
[1:16:43] the Lord God formed man of the Dust of
[1:16:45] the ground the dust of the ground dust
[1:16:47] there is loose dirt when it's wet it
[1:16:50] becomes mud you could say you're made
[1:16:51] out of
[1:16:53] mud J 319 in the sweat of thy face shalt
[1:16:56] thou eat bread till thou return to the
[1:16:57] ground for out of it was thou taken for
[1:17:00] dust Thou Art to dust shalt thou return
[1:17:04] again job 10:9 he said job speaking I
[1:17:07] believe he said remember I beseech thee
[1:17:08] that thou has made me as the clay and
[1:17:11] wilt thou bring me into dust again
[1:17:13] Ecclesiastes 3:20 all go into one place
[1:17:15] all are of the dust and all turn to dust
[1:17:19] again our bodies are literally made from
[1:17:23] dirt right
[1:17:26] we have a a a constant little tension in
[1:17:29] our house because I don't want to comb
[1:17:30] my hair no
[1:17:33] more you might comb hairs I comb
[1:17:40] hair it's all right you can laugh at
[1:17:42] that but but you
[1:17:45] know I want to cut it as short as I can
[1:17:47] get it or cut it you know shave it off I
[1:17:50] can get a wig
[1:17:55] my wife doesn't want that but you know
[1:17:58] our we're just
[1:17:59] dirt that's all we are is dirt whenever
[1:18:02] you comb your hair you're combing
[1:18:04] dirt when I was in Togo one of the
[1:18:07] oddest things I've ever seen and it's
[1:18:09] just they Tred government tries to give
[1:18:10] people jobs because there's no jobs and
[1:18:12] so I saw these women out there in long
[1:18:14] dresses and head scarves and things that
[1:18:15] they wear and they're out there on a
[1:18:18] dirt street with brooms with cornstalks
[1:18:21] and stuff sticking out the end of it and
[1:18:23] so it's just like a corn broom like they
[1:18:25] used to have or whatever they straw
[1:18:26] broom they're standing with straw brooms
[1:18:28] and they're all in the street sweeping
[1:18:30] the
[1:18:31] street like it's
[1:18:34] dirt you sweep the dirt off there'll be
[1:18:36] more
[1:18:37] dirt and more tomorrow but they just had
[1:18:39] to have something to do so they swept
[1:18:42] the dirt and they just kept sweeping the
[1:18:43] dirt sweeping the dirt and sweeping the
[1:18:44] dirt and that's what we're doing we're
[1:18:46] taking care of of dirt we're taking care
[1:18:48] of 5 fo n inches of dirt some more some
[1:18:52] less right but it's just dirt
[1:18:55] we're a bunch brother said the 16
[1:18:56] elements of the earth Cosmic light
[1:18:58] petroleum things put together we were
[1:19:00] here when God spoke and said let there
[1:19:01] be our bodies were now listen we're not
[1:19:04] just dirt we're the same dirt that was
[1:19:07] in in the ground in the beginning now
[1:19:09] remember what Genesis 1 said in the
[1:19:11] beginning God created the heavens and
[1:19:12] earth period and then it says the Earth
[1:19:14] was without form and void and darkness
[1:19:15] lay upon the face of the deep in that
[1:19:17] Earth we
[1:19:19] were right we were there our bodies we
[1:19:23] were there in in in the form of
[1:19:24] chemicals or whatever that it was and
[1:19:26] dust and so brother brand said we were
[1:19:29] there but something a mastermind yeah
[1:19:32] developed us into what we are
[1:19:35] now Hallelujah so we can't hate on
[1:19:38] ourselves too much can we I know you
[1:19:40] girls sometimes you know young ladies
[1:19:42] you be just you look in the mirror and
[1:19:44] say oh no I'm never going to get married
[1:19:47] just nobody's ever going to like me and
[1:19:48] everybody's you know everybody's looking
[1:19:50] down on me and all this stuff and and
[1:19:52] the truth is you're just dirt
[1:19:56] all
[1:19:57] right so you could actually feel a lot
[1:19:59] worse about yourself but I'll say this
[1:20:00] is to make you feel better your dirt
[1:20:02] that a master oh my a master got a hold
[1:20:05] of and the reason you are what you are
[1:20:07] and the reason why you can even look
[1:20:09] pretty the reason why you can even be
[1:20:11] handsome the reason why you can even
[1:20:13] ever ever have a hope of having a family
[1:20:16] is because the master got a hold of you
[1:20:20] and made something out of the dirt well
[1:20:21] if he did that to your body don't you
[1:20:23] believe he could do that to your soul
[1:20:25] don't you believe he can make a new body
[1:20:26] for you and change this body in a moment
[1:20:29] in a twinkling of an
[1:20:30] eye we get so down on ourselves
[1:20:33] sometimes I do it too I know what that
[1:20:34] feels like all it takes is a mirror to
[1:20:36] depress
[1:20:39] me and the bigger the mirror is the more
[1:20:42] depressed I
[1:20:44] get you know you lie to yourself in the
[1:20:47] mirror you ever notice that this wasn't
[1:20:49] in my
[1:20:50] notes you lie to yourself in the mirror
[1:20:53] you get to look into the mirror you
[1:20:54] don't never stand stand like this you
[1:20:56] know shouldn't have stood that way in
[1:20:58] front of the
[1:20:59] cameras but you you you always stand
[1:21:01] face forward you stand kind
[1:21:04] of looks pretty good stretch that chin
[1:21:06] out you
[1:21:08] know looks pretty good from that
[1:21:11] angle that's not that's not what
[1:21:14] everybody else
[1:21:15] sees what does everybody see
[1:21:20] dirt see but brother Bram taught us that
[1:21:22] our bodies were on the earth before
[1:21:24] there was any like here and so we're
[1:21:26] made of those 16 elements and our bodies
[1:21:27] were laying spread out on the earth
[1:21:29] before there was any type of life on the
[1:21:30] earth he said and then when God cooled
[1:21:32] it off and set it over there in his
[1:21:34] great mind you remember I don't have
[1:21:36] time to go there this morning but
[1:21:37] Lucifer walked over the Earth he walked
[1:21:40] over The Lava the burning lava but it
[1:21:42] was it was he was claiming it as his
[1:21:44] possession but God took it away from him
[1:21:47] he said you can't have that dirt that
[1:21:49] dirt belongs to me and he made a man out
[1:21:52] of it and then when God cooled it off
[1:21:54] and said it over there in his great mind
[1:21:56] he had something in his mind he was
[1:21:57] going to do he said there isn't may you
[1:21:59] take me to record this morning friend
[1:22:00] there isn't enough power in all hell can
[1:22:02] ever defeat the purpose of God God will
[1:22:05] tell you do it anyhow do you believe
[1:22:06] that today there's none enough power in
[1:22:08] hell if you got a purpose in your life
[1:22:10] to serve and you do there ain't enough
[1:22:12] power in hell that can defeat that
[1:22:14] purpose amen amen 16 elements found in
[1:22:19] the dirt bundled
[1:22:21] together BR said boy you glorify the
[1:22:23] flesh but that Spirit has a soul in
[1:22:25] there my brother that's right but your
[1:22:28] flesh is just dust of the earth like the
[1:22:30] animal your flesh is no more than an
[1:22:32] animal he said now and the hear this
[1:22:34] great theophan he standing there what
[1:22:35] that great Jehovah God you know what he
[1:22:37] said I love this he just reached over
[1:22:40] and got a handful of Adams got a little
[1:22:42] light and poured it in and
[1:22:46] went where did he do that before when he
[1:22:49] made himself a
[1:22:51] body just reached over and got a handful
[1:22:54] so that's how you were
[1:22:58] made you just stepped right into
[1:23:01] it said come here
[1:23:03] Gabriel now brother BR was talking about
[1:23:05] Abraham again he said come here Gabriel
[1:23:07] that great Archangel
[1:23:09] went stepping
[1:23:11] that come here Michael the angel at his
[1:23:14] right
[1:23:16] side Oh my he said for step in that God
[1:23:21] and two angels walk down there in human
[1:23:22] flesh drank the milk from a cow eat the
[1:23:25] butter out of the milk eat some
[1:23:26] cornbread eat the Flesh of the calf two
[1:23:29] angels and God now brother brand said
[1:23:32] when they were done with those bodies he
[1:23:33] just put it back in the
[1:23:35] dust turned it back to dust and stepped
[1:23:37] back into another dimension right Oh my
[1:23:41] he said now what a great hope we have in
[1:23:43] this great faith we serve tonight the
[1:23:45] Living God the Jehovah the pillar of
[1:23:47] fire is with us and I remember a day
[1:23:49] when people didn't teach that they said
[1:23:51] well the pillar of fire is with brother
[1:23:52] brandham but we've come to understand
[1:23:53] that a prophet taught that the pillar of
[1:23:55] fire is with us that's what he said the
[1:23:58] pillar of fire is with us shows himself
[1:23:59] in power and action and magnify let them
[1:24:02] take the picture of the same Jehovah the
[1:24:03] Son of God that came from God went back
[1:24:05] to God and dwells in his church forever
[1:24:07] more I hear somebody saying that that
[1:24:08] well that brother Ben if that pillar
[1:24:10] fires here why don't we see it it's in
[1:24:12] you why don't you see it for the same
[1:24:14] reason Joshua didn't see it what did he
[1:24:16] see the captain of the host he saw the
[1:24:19] pillar of fire in a
[1:24:21] man brother brandom taught him taught us
[1:24:24] that
[1:24:25] he said he dwells in his church forever
[1:24:26] more there he is he dwells in his church
[1:24:28] forever more Oh my he has our names on
[1:24:30] his book with a sworn Oath by himself
[1:24:33] there's no one greater he can swear by
[1:24:34] that he'll raise us up in the last day
[1:24:36] that same one he said could just reach
[1:24:38] and grab a handful of calcium and P as
[1:24:40] and
[1:24:41] go there you are
[1:24:44] again Hallelujah and my name is on his
[1:24:47] book why do I care how stoop my
[1:24:50] shoulders are getting how old I get
[1:24:52] certainly not not a bit of worry he
[1:24:54] speaks to a man brother Mike we got a
[1:24:56] brother Mike here but he speaks to
[1:24:57] brother Mike he said' one of these days
[1:24:59] bless your heart brother when that great
[1:25:00] trumpet will come that sound and that
[1:25:02] Joseph will step forth he's not talking
[1:25:05] about his son Joseph he's talking about
[1:25:07] he's talking about Joseph in the Bible
[1:25:09] what what what was he saying Joseph will
[1:25:11] step forth Joseph had to step from
[1:25:13] behind the curtain and reveal himself to
[1:25:14] his Brethren someday that Joseph will
[1:25:16] step forth he will say
[1:25:20] children that's
[1:25:22] powerful there will be made in in his
[1:25:24] likeness Young Forever old age has
[1:25:27] passed away sickness trouble Sorrows has
[1:25:30] vanished glory be to the Living
[1:25:34] God dust was on his clothes but it takes
[1:25:36] the faith of Abraham to see past
[1:25:40] that excuse me was not
[1:25:43] extraordinary that dust would be there
[1:25:46] it was a desert country that was a very
[1:25:49] ordinary thing for a guy who wasn't God
[1:25:54] the only extraordinary thing about it is
[1:25:56] how ordinary it was yes but God always
[1:25:59] comes that
[1:26:00] way and I hear the criticism and stuff
[1:26:03] people say well these preachers always
[1:26:04] mess things up yeah because they're
[1:26:06] human but that's still what God
[1:26:09] uses these people they always mess
[1:26:11] things up but we don't serve God in
[1:26:13] Supernatural bodies not yet we serve him
[1:26:17] in flesh
[1:26:18] bodies redeemed flesh but still flesh
[1:26:22] right right and and actually the
[1:26:24] redeemed part is our soul right that
[1:26:26] just controls the flesh but the truth is
[1:26:28] the flesh is still flesh yeah it's still
[1:26:31] as bad as it ever
[1:26:32] was right you give it enough Liberty
[1:26:35] you'll find
[1:26:36] out and and Paul says I keep under my
[1:26:39] body I keep it under subjection every
[1:26:40] day I die daily to make sure that I I I
[1:26:44] re receive the goal that that I after PR
[1:26:47] having preached to others I am
[1:26:49] disapproved
[1:26:50] myself and God's always come that way
[1:26:52] listen but if you look at the evidence
[1:26:54] now now now just hear me this morning
[1:26:56] people are going to try to always tell
[1:26:57] you where is the evidence if you look at
[1:27:01] the evidence that Abraham saw he would
[1:27:04] say these people couldn't be God it
[1:27:07] couldn't be Elohim because they must
[1:27:08] have come from a far country they've
[1:27:09] been
[1:27:11] traveling they look like ordinary men
[1:27:14] the evidence proved
[1:27:18] scientifically that it wasn't God that
[1:27:20] just a minute ago
[1:27:24] but it still
[1:27:26] was because if there's anybody that can
[1:27:28] fake evidence it's
[1:27:31] God now think about it he created Jesus
[1:27:36] in the womb of Mary and the evidence was
[1:27:39] that it was an out of wedlock
[1:27:41] birth the evidence said that he was just
[1:27:44] a man the evidence said that there was
[1:27:47] nothing he could do Church the evidence
[1:27:50] said that he probably was still in the
[1:27:52] grave and somebody stole his body but we
[1:27:54] believe he raised again on the third day
[1:27:56] we believe that he's the son of God we
[1:27:58] believe he's interceding for us today we
[1:28:01] believe that why not because of the
[1:28:03] evidence but because we're Abraham's
[1:28:05] seed all the evidence showed these folks
[1:28:07] did not come from Heaven they traveled
[1:28:09] somewhere on the earth and the dust
[1:28:11] proved that they come from the earth yes
[1:28:14] right that's what dust says you come
[1:28:16] from the earth and the dust was evidence
[1:28:18] against him being I'm going somewhere
[1:28:20] Church the dust was evidence against him
[1:28:22] being from Heaven because dust is only
[1:28:24] found on the earth yeah and if you were
[1:28:27] from Heaven why did you pick up that
[1:28:29] dust
[1:28:31] yeah come on church we do the same thing
[1:28:34] to one another right we look at one
[1:28:36] another and say well if that person was
[1:28:43] saved come on church it's easy to be
[1:28:48] critical it's easy to be critical of
[1:28:50] other people's dust you ever walked in
[1:28:52] somebody's house that was Dusty don't
[1:28:53] come in mind if that bothers
[1:28:57] you I'm sorry
[1:29:00] Britney I keep Britney rolling all the
[1:29:02] time just running because we're always
[1:29:04] going and doing something and if you if
[1:29:07] if a little dust bothers you you'll have
[1:29:08] a problem in my house because there's
[1:29:11] always going to be a little bit of dust
[1:29:12] there's always something that didn't get
[1:29:14] dusted as hard as she works but what is
[1:29:16] it dust is just a natural
[1:29:19] occurence no matter how hard you work in
[1:29:21] a church this is my heart this morning
[1:29:24] church as your pastor I as hard as you
[1:29:26] work in a church as much as you try to
[1:29:27] keep everything right and we have this
[1:29:29] perfect group of young people we got
[1:29:30] this perfect group of Elders and we got
[1:29:32] this perfect group of people and all our
[1:29:34] services are perfect and everything go
[1:29:36] oh you don't see what goes on behind the
[1:29:39] scenes you don't know how hard that
[1:29:41] Deacon worked in the morning to get
[1:29:42] ready to show up
[1:29:44] late and we won't say which
[1:29:49] Deacon but you don't know like you don't
[1:29:51] see the dust many times times CU we wipe
[1:29:55] it off real clean you know and come up
[1:29:57] here to church but every one of us has
[1:30:00] it and I think sometimes I have people
[1:30:02] tell me they say well you know message
[1:30:04] culture is so you know it's this way and
[1:30:06] I feel like I don't fit in with message
[1:30:07] culture well that's not what we're
[1:30:09] trying to fit in we're trying to be
[1:30:10] children of God and children of God got
[1:30:13] dust on their clothes but they believe
[1:30:14] in Holiness children of God got dust in
[1:30:16] their clothes but they believe the
[1:30:17] message of the hour children of God got
[1:30:19] dust on their feet and they get dirty
[1:30:21] but that's why we go to church to be
[1:30:22] Washed by the Water of the word if we
[1:30:24] were perfect we wouldn't need the house
[1:30:26] of
[1:30:27] God what do we need we need the dust
[1:30:29] wiped off of us oh God wash me this
[1:30:32] morning let me stay under the Fountain
[1:30:34] of the word to be washed from all of
[1:30:36] these
[1:30:36] things yes and maybe when we're critical
[1:30:39] that's the moment our dust is the
[1:30:42] worst that's
[1:30:44] evidence of Earthly
[1:30:47] Origins it is
[1:30:57] Abraham you might have asked him if this
[1:30:59] is Elohim why do you have to wash his
[1:31:01] feet why in the world is he eating
[1:31:03] cornbread and milk doesn't he have
[1:31:04] better things to
[1:31:05] do like the people who got the upset if
[1:31:08] their Pastor because the pastor was all
[1:31:10] the time visiting the sick said never
[1:31:11] spends any time in study so he started
[1:31:14] just studying all the time and said well
[1:31:15] he never spends any time visiting the
[1:31:20] sick why is there dust on his clothes
[1:31:23] this is important we don't want to get
[1:31:25] discouraged by the dust yeah see there
[1:31:28] was dust on the prophet's clothes the
[1:31:30] prophet that come in our day he was
[1:31:32] human sometimes he misspoke or said
[1:31:34] things in the wrong order he had a wife
[1:31:35] and children he worried about things he
[1:31:38] was nervous every seven years he had a a
[1:31:41] case what he called the
[1:31:42] blues come over him but God did more
[1:31:45] through that body than he had done
[1:31:46] through any body of Flesh that he'd ever
[1:31:48] used on the earth yeah right that's the
[1:31:52] truth h
[1:31:55] brother Bram even said he did more in my
[1:31:56] Ministry than he did in his own when he
[1:31:57] was on the earth brother brand didn't
[1:31:59] say that as a humble brag he said that
[1:32:01] because it was
[1:32:04] true but Jesus said to John he said what
[1:32:06] went you out to see what did you go to
[1:32:08] church to see what went you out to see a
[1:32:10] prophet he said more than a prophet
[1:32:13] right yeah for this is he of whom it was
[1:32:15] written behold I send my messenger
[1:32:16] before thy face which shall prepare thy
[1:32:18] way before thee verily I say unto you
[1:32:20] among them that are born of women there
[1:32:21] is not risen a greater than John the
[1:32:23] Baptist
[1:32:24] notwithstanding he that is least in the
[1:32:26] Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he why
[1:32:30] because greater is he that receives than
[1:32:31] he who
[1:32:32] sent right we're servants greater is the

[1:35:37] the messenger but on the message what it
[1:35:40] said that's the thing to look at so we
[1:35:43] wipe the dirt off the
[1:35:44] messenger because we know the message is
[1:35:47] God message is from God you see it we're
[1:35:51] not worshiping the messenger that's not
[1:35:53] what we do do we do wipe the dirt
[1:36:00] off we pay way too much attention to
[1:36:04] dust see the Bible says I'm just taking
[1:36:07] my time this morning but I've got a few
[1:36:08] more minutes and we'll close looks like
[1:36:10] we'll be on
[1:36:12] time the Bible says like as a father pth
[1:36:15] his children so the Lord pth them that
[1:36:18] fear Him He has compassion see he sees
[1:36:22] past the Dust listen what he says verse
[1:36:24] 14 for he knows our
[1:36:27] frame and what that word frame means is
[1:36:29] is our method of construction why he did
[1:36:33] it yeah he knows how we were
[1:36:36] made he remember that we are
[1:36:41] dust he remembers that we are you say
[1:36:44] that's good I'm glad that God sees and
[1:36:47] knows that I'm dust because I make
[1:36:48] mistakes I think all of us can say Amen
[1:36:50] to that I'm glad he sees where do you
[1:36:52] realize he's called to do the same thing
[1:36:55] for one
[1:36:59] another 1 Peter 38 finally be all of One
[1:37:02] mind having compassion one of another
[1:37:04] love as Brethren be
[1:37:07] pitiful be
[1:37:09] courteous not rendering evil for evil or
[1:37:11] railing for railing but contrary wise
[1:37:14] blessing knowing that are you are there
[1:37:16] un to called that you should inherit a
[1:37:18] blessing I don't care how much religion
[1:37:20] you got I don't care how much of this
[1:37:21] message you know or how many quotes you
[1:37:23] can quote if you treat people badly yeah
[1:37:26] you don't have a revelation of
[1:37:30] this if you treat your
[1:37:32] enemies
[1:37:34] rudely you don't you don't do what he
[1:37:38] said right and we're all dust we do
[1:37:41] sometimes we're rude sometimes we mess
[1:37:43] up sometimes but even our enemies we
[1:37:46] shouldn't but especially our Brethren
[1:37:48] our
[1:37:49] sisters he said Brethren you've been
[1:37:51] called unto Liberty but use not Liberty
[1:37:54] for an occasion to the flesh but by love
[1:37:56] serve one another for all the law is
[1:37:59] fulfilled in one word even in this Thou
[1:38:01] shalt love thy neighbor as
[1:38:05] thyself again Galatians 61 and and and
[1:38:08] that was from Peter and then Galatians 5
[1:38:10] in Galatians 61 Brethren if a man be
[1:38:12] overtaken in a
[1:38:14] fault now why did Paul write that CU he
[1:38:17] knew men would be overtaken in
[1:38:21] faults ye which are spiritual
[1:38:24] how many are believe that you're
[1:38:25] spiritual no that's kind of a trick
[1:38:27] question isn't it but I think we if
[1:38:30] we're Christians we ought to be able to
[1:38:31] raise our hands to that right but you
[1:38:35] that are spiritual and I know a lot of
[1:38:36] people call themselves spiritual and
[1:38:38] count themselves as spiritual those are
[1:38:39] people are usually
[1:38:42] troubled because they know
[1:38:44] everything but you that are really
[1:38:46] spiritual here's how to act restore such
[1:38:50] a one in the spirit of meekness
[1:38:54] and and meekness doesn't mean to just
[1:38:55] give up give in to whatever everything
[1:38:56] they want meekness means to have
[1:38:59] yourself in
[1:39:01] self-control considering thyself lest
[1:39:05] thou also be tempted because you're dust
[1:39:08] too bear one another's burdens and so
[1:39:11] fulfill the law of Christ listen when
[1:39:13] the Ark of the Covenant was carried into
[1:39:15] the public all you saw was Badger
[1:39:20] skins they just covered it up
[1:39:24] so we think about the ark you know
[1:39:25] you've seen pictures of the Ark going
[1:39:27] places and you see the ark that's
[1:39:28] actually not true you never saw the ark
[1:39:31] when it traveled Moses said throw a
[1:39:35] blanket on it put the skin on it right
[1:39:38] just like it a skin was hanging in the
[1:39:40] Tabernacle the skin went with it
[1:39:41] wherever it went so they didn't actually
[1:39:44] see the ark but they knew the ark was
[1:39:46] there so the oh my it was God
[1:39:51] deity the the shakina presence of God
[1:39:55] hid the glory of God hid from the people
[1:39:58] he said that old Badger skin what did it
[1:39:59] do it hid the glory of God from the
[1:40:01] people the badger skins even people
[1:40:02] couldn't see it because it was a skin
[1:40:04] that held it the skin was the glory of
[1:40:07] God was behind the
[1:40:11] skin Oh church we can only see that
[1:40:14] Jared the glory of God is behind your
[1:40:17] skin all the little girls said
[1:40:21] amen sorry buddy but the truth is that's
[1:40:23] all of us right the glory of God is
[1:40:27] behind our
[1:40:28] [Music]
[1:40:29] skin Oh church if we're born again the
[1:40:33] glory the shikina glory wouldn't it have
[1:40:35] been awesome to walk into the presence
[1:40:38] of the shikina of God and see that great
[1:40:40] Pillar of Fire hanging there and feel
[1:40:43] the presence the atmosphere as you
[1:40:45] walked into the Tabernacle wouldn't have
[1:40:46] been awesome but only a high priest was
[1:40:48] allowed to go in once a year but that
[1:40:50] same Glory yeah is in the heart of the
[1:40:53] believer today brother BR said now the
[1:40:56] glory of God is behind your skin he
[1:40:59] didn't just say my skin though it was
[1:41:01] behind his skin but he said your skin
[1:41:04] the glory of God is behind your skin
[1:41:06] that's right and the Traditions don't
[1:41:08] see it it's inside the veil where his
[1:41:10] word was what was on the inside of that
[1:41:12] skin back there the old Badger skin
[1:41:14] which there was no Beauty we should
[1:41:16] desire it and when it was made flesh and
[1:41:18] dwelt Among Us it was still no Beauty we
[1:41:20] should desire it he said and now the
[1:41:22] same thing is today there's nothing in a
[1:41:24] man or a woman that can be desired it's
[1:41:26] what's in behind there that's what it is
[1:41:28] we're looking at the wrong thing Church
[1:41:31] you're looking at the wrong thing in the
[1:41:32] young people you're looking at the wrong
[1:41:33] thing in the elders you're looking at
[1:41:34] the wrong thing in the pastor look at
[1:41:36] what's behind the
[1:41:38] skin it's what's in behind there that's
[1:41:40] what it is when you say that fellow I
[1:41:42] know he used to be a drunker he used to
[1:41:43] do this he said I don't care what he
[1:41:45] used to do what's hid behind that skin
[1:41:50] what is behind there that's what counts
[1:41:52] I don't care where you come from from
[1:41:53] where you've been what's behind
[1:41:56] there
[1:41:58] huh I'm not going to count that you
[1:42:00] coming to church and doing whatever you
[1:42:01] want to do and I'll preach at that you
[1:42:04] going to live a sinful lifestyle and
[1:42:06] claim to be a Christian and have a bad
[1:42:08] attitude and do all that you'll get
[1:42:09] preached at he said how do you know I
[1:42:12] may not even know about it but you'll
[1:42:13] get preached
[1:42:14] at because the word will correct that
[1:42:17] but but you I don't care what you've
[1:42:21] done if you've been filled with the Holy
[1:42:23] Ghost and God has cleansed your heart
[1:42:25] there's
[1:42:27] Glory his
[1:42:29] glory is behind the
[1:42:33] skin and it's incumbent on me who
[1:42:35] doesn't have the ability like God God
[1:42:38] has the ability to forget that put it
[1:42:40] out of his mind I don't but it's
[1:42:43] incumbent on me to act like God and say
[1:42:46] what the word says and say it's
[1:42:50] over what's behind there is what counts
[1:42:54] he said that's what the people is
[1:42:55] blinded the skin blinds the people they
[1:42:58] say I remember when that woman used to I
[1:43:01] know what she used to but what about
[1:43:03] now and the skins that was once on the
[1:43:05] badger but now it's hiding the glory of
[1:43:07] God got it housed behind it it was on an
[1:43:10] animal but now it's housing the glory of
[1:43:12] God listen he said and so can your skin
[1:43:15] be changed tonight to be made a housing
[1:43:19] place for God God dwelling in how many
[1:43:22] want that this morning and as we come
[1:43:23] down to a close how many want that God
[1:43:25] dwelling in humanity wants to change
[1:43:27] your skin until it's like the badger
[1:43:29] skin it just covering up
[1:43:31] God oh my still the same skin it ever
[1:43:35] was but it's changed from just being
[1:43:37] covering a badger to cover in the
[1:43:39] almighty God
[1:43:43] yes we need to be careful
[1:43:46] Church listen how we treat one another
[1:43:48] is how we treat
[1:43:50] God and and how critical we are of each
[1:43:53] other some it's easy to criticize I want
[1:43:55] to say
[1:43:56] this when's the last time you got down
[1:43:58] and prayed for that
[1:44:01] person I guarantee you this that person
[1:44:04] that you criticize and and I expect you
[1:44:06] especially with our young people it
[1:44:07] takes a whole church kind of to keep
[1:44:09] them in line and we got to do that
[1:44:11] sometimes you got to say something i'
[1:44:13] rather you say something and then let it
[1:44:15] go and then then it becomes a problem
[1:44:17] but I'll say
[1:44:19] this make sure you understand what's
[1:44:21] behind it what's behind that
[1:44:25] skin when you go to criticizing people
[1:44:27] make sure you understand what's behind
[1:44:29] that skin is this a
[1:44:30] Christian are they really a Believer
[1:44:33] maybe they're messed up but are they a
[1:44:35] believer that don't countenance to sin
[1:44:38] but there's something in there and and I
[1:44:40] guarantee you this if we start praying
[1:44:42] for people instead of criticizing people
[1:44:45] there'd be a
[1:44:47] difference in this
[1:44:51] church if we just pray for if all people
[1:44:54] would do and I think most of you do I
[1:44:55] believe all of you do but if all you did
[1:44:57] would just pray for your pastor and S
[1:44:59] criticize it would make a difference in
[1:45:01] the
[1:45:01] services if all you did is pray for the
[1:45:03] musician instead of criticize them it's
[1:45:05] a hard job right if all you did was pray
[1:45:08] for them instead of criticize make a
[1:45:10] difference if all you did was pray for
[1:45:12] the young people instead of criticize
[1:45:13] them and make a
[1:45:14] difference if all you did was oh church
[1:45:18] if all you did was get down on your
[1:45:20] knees and I pray to God that we could do
[1:45:21] that prayer makes a difference
[1:45:23] it still changes
[1:45:27] things but it's easier to
[1:45:30] criticize I want to say this this
[1:45:31] morning as a musicians come the god of
[1:45:33] William brandom is not in that flesh
[1:45:36] body
[1:45:37] anymore how can you say that because I
[1:45:39] went by the grave the other day that
[1:45:41] body is in the
[1:45:43] Tomb but the god of William brandham
[1:45:45] didn't
[1:45:46] die we saw his grave we saw the
[1:45:48] Tabernacle
[1:45:50] closed I went by the voice of God I
[1:45:52] hadn't been there I think in 18
[1:45:54] years and I walked up and there's
[1:45:56] nothing going on that I could see places
[1:46:00] sitting empty and the sign and they have
[1:46:02] their reasons I believe they're changing
[1:46:03] the name on the sign but the sign was
[1:46:05] painted over
[1:46:07] and I walked up and knocked on the door
[1:46:09] and a lady come very nice
[1:46:11] and told me they were
[1:46:15] closed but that's not where God is I
[1:46:19] thought deeply about this this week if
[1:46:21] this church closes tomorrow God won't
[1:46:22] die
[1:46:26] listen he said if God is in your heart
[1:46:28] you'll want to assemble yourselves
[1:46:29] together that word
[1:46:33] lives that word lives the god of William
[1:46:37] brandom is not dead somewhere in Africa
[1:46:39] there's a little church made out of
[1:46:40] sticks I've been there I've been to one
[1:46:43] out of out of hundreds or even thousands
[1:46:46] of those little churches in Egypt
[1:46:48] there's a few Believers meeting in an
[1:46:50] old Coptic church I've been there
[1:46:53] in the Philippines they sit on hard
[1:46:55] wooden pews I've said in
[1:46:57] those in China they meet in the
[1:47:00] underground Church in India they sit in
[1:47:03] buildings with no roof I've preached to
[1:47:05] them over the internet but the god of
[1:47:08] Elijah Hallelujah is still with his
[1:47:12] people yes he hasn't died he's still the
[1:47:16] same yesterday today and forever he's
[1:47:19] still here this morning and I want to
[1:47:21] declare that God to you as Paul stood
[1:47:23] there at the Tomb of the or or or the
[1:47:26] the altar to the unknown God he said you
[1:47:29] worshiping a God you don't even know
[1:47:31] just in case there's a God that he said
[1:47:32] I want to declare the god you don't know
[1:47:34] to you he said I want to tell you
[1:47:35] there's a living God I want to tell you
[1:47:38] God never died I want to tell you he's
[1:47:39] the same yesterday today and forever I'm
[1:47:42] here to tell you he lives in young
[1:47:43] people he lives in Elders he lives in
[1:47:45] the deacons he lives in pastors there's
[1:47:47] somebody that's got God in them if you
[1:47:50] don't have God inside of you today
[1:47:51] there's a there's an opport opportunity
[1:47:53] to house God in your mortal
[1:47:56] flesh somewhere in Hardy Arkansas
[1:48:00] there's a congregation with dust on
[1:48:02] their
[1:48:03] clothes and others might look at Hardy
[1:48:07] and say what good could come out of
[1:48:08] Hardy's kind of like being from
[1:48:11] Nazareth but their only desire is to
[1:48:13] entertain
[1:48:16] Elohim that's my desire this morning I
[1:48:19] didn't come here to entertain
[1:48:21] you I didn't come here here just to make
[1:48:24] people feel better about themselves
[1:48:25] though I hope you do that's not why I
[1:48:28] came I came to entertain
[1:48:31] Elohim he didn't die in Jeffersonville

[1:48:38] forever and that God I declare to you

[1:50:28] was a kid when everything was operating
[1:50:30] and everything was busy was a little
[1:50:31] disappointed but I've never been
[1:50:33] disappointed in the god of Elijah I've
[1:50:36] never been disappointed in the fact that
[1:50:39] he still comes by my way he still heals
[1:50:42] the sick he still raises the dead he's
[1:50:45] the same yesterday today and forever you
[1:50:48] love him with all your heart amen let's

[1:51:07] look past yourself look past the dust
[1:51:11] see
[1:51:16] Christ how would we treat one another

[1:51:24] did see something say brother I don't
[1:51:25] want to see you go that way how much
[1:51:28] would we pray for one
[1:51:30] another if we can really

[1:52:36] love me so much that you called me
[1:52:38] before the foundation of the earth and

[1:52:44] were talking the other day and and he
[1:52:46] and he told me that really what it is is
[1:52:48] predestination and I begin to think

[1:52:52] would I be without predes how could I
[1:52:54] ever come to the placing of a son as I
[1:52:57] was predestined to do it I pray you'd
[1:52:59] Grant it Lord I pray you'd help us to
