[36:41] look like they were going to stand
[36:42] against the earthquake. You know, just
[36:44] standing together. I believe it gives us
[36:46] strength tonight. Amen. Genesis 49:19.
[36:49] Good to have uh brother Caleb and sister
[36:51] or brother Caleb's parents with us
[36:54] tonight. God bless you guys. I It's
[36:57] sister Sophie's birthday, isn't it? My
[36:59] goodness. We won't say how old she is,
[37:02] but what a blessing, Brother Caleb and
[37:04] Sister Sophie are here to the church and
[37:06] and Brother Caleb being a deacon and and
[37:09] uh doing his job and and taking care of
[37:11] it. And those kids are just such a big
[37:13] part of what we do. And we're so
[37:15] thankful for that. He's just uh
[37:17] repopulating the earth all by himself,
[37:20] but we're glad to have
[37:22] him. Genesis
[37:27] 49:19 says, "Gad a troop shall overcome
[37:31] him, but he shall
[37:33] overcome at the last." Let's bow our
[37:36] heads
[37:37] together. Heavenly Father, Lord, you you
[37:41] said that knowing the book was one
[37:44] thing. It was good, but Lord, we needed
[37:46] to know the author. Lord, I'm so glad
[37:49] you sent a prophet in our day that knew
[37:51] the author. So thankful for that. But
[37:53] Lord, we we have to know you as well. I
[37:56] pray, God, that you'd help us tonight to
[37:58] to not only get the word that's written
[38:01] on the page, but the revelation of it.
[38:03] Lord, I pray that you'd reveal yourself
[38:05] to us tonight, how much you love us, how
[38:07] much you you care about us, what your
[38:09] will is for our lives. I pray God that
[38:12] if there's one sick among us tonight
[38:13] that they would be healed. If there's
[38:15] one that needs to come closer to the
[38:16] fire, a backslider, maybe I wouldn't
[38:18] know what that that would be. But Lord,
[38:20] you know, I pray you'd speak directly to
[38:22] them as only you can do. Move move me
[38:25] out of the way, Lord. I realize
[38:27] that Lord, I'm insufficient in myself to
[38:31] do
[38:32] it. But I pray God that you'd help me in
[38:35] every way. We thank you for it in Jesus
[38:38] name. Amen. God bless you. You can be
[38:55] seated. We've gone through
[38:57] Reuben, Simeon and Levi, Judah, Dan,
[39:01] Zebulun, and Napili. And now tonight,
[39:04] Gad. I was going to do Gad and Manasseh
[39:07] together, but I just got caught up in
[39:09] the study and we just wouldn't have time
[39:12] to take both tonight. So, I want to do
[39:14] this tonight. I I think we can all agree
[39:17] tonight that Jesus is the word. The
[39:21] Bible says in John 1 and 1, in the
[39:23] beginning was the word and the word was
[39:25] with God and the word was God. And then
[39:28] in verse 14, and the word was made flesh
[39:30] and dwelt among us, and we beheld his
[39:33] glory, the glory as of the only begotten
[39:36] of the father, full of grace and truth.
[39:38] Now, brother Brandham takes that uh and
[39:41] it's in a sermon called his unfailing
[39:44] words of promise. Well, that's a
[39:45] powerful uh powerful title. He said,
[39:48] 'Then as God gave out his word, what
[39:50] would be predestinated his church before
[39:54] the foundation of the world, it would
[39:56] appear before him without spot or
[39:59] wrinkle. He said, "And the time piece is
[40:02] moving right on down," he said, "and it
[40:06] will be there." That gives me great
[40:08] comfort tonight. You say, "Brother Ben,
[40:10] what are you looking at? Are you looking
[40:11] at the people? Are you looking at what's
[40:13] going on?" I'm not looking at that at
[40:15] all tonight, but we're looking at the
[40:17] promise of the word. And the word says
[40:19] it will be there, a church, a glorious
[40:21] church without spot or wrinkle. And he
[40:24] said, I'm trusting that we're all here
[40:25] tonight members of that church. He said,
[40:28] and that there's only one way to enter
[40:30] that church, not by any denomination. He
[40:32] said, you enter it by new birth. And you
[40:35] say, well, I I believe that. He said, if
[40:38] you do, then you will punctuate every
[40:40] word of this Bible with an amen.
[40:44] every word of the Bible. He said, "If
[40:46] you have the new birth, you'll punctuate
[40:47] it with an amen." Everything the Bible
[40:49] says because it is Christ and you are a
[40:53] part of Christ and the Holy Spirit
[40:55] revealing this truth. Now, this is what
[40:57] I wanted to get to uh in this
[41:00] quote, he said, "Each age has had its
[41:04] allotment of word to be fulfilled." Word
[41:08] allotment, we've been through that. It's
[41:10] it's an inheritance, right? It's what's
[41:13] given to us by God. So each age had
[41:17] something given to them by God that
[41:19] would be fulfilled in that age. So we
[41:23] know that this is the age of the
[41:25] fullness of the word. Someone say that
[41:27] word with me because we're going to hear
[41:28] it tonight. Fullness. The fullness of
[41:31] Christ, the fullness of the word. I want
[41:33] you to hold that in your mind now
[41:34] because we're going to come back here at
[41:36] some point tonight. Lord, the Lord
[41:39] willing. Now Gad means good fortune. The
[41:42] word gad means good fortune or or troop.
[41:44] It's a it's a word with a dual meaning.
[41:47] In Genesis 30 and10 it says uh Zilpa
[41:51] Leah's maid bear Jacob a son and Leah
[41:54] said a troop cometh and she called his
[41:56] name Gad. So uh we find then that uh uh
[42:01] Gad is a very uh he he he's given a name
[42:05] just like all of the others that's a
[42:06] prophecy over his life. So when Jacob
[42:09] prophesies in Genesis 49:19 that we read
[42:13] uh he he uses word play on the name. He
[42:15] says Gad a troop shall overcome him but
[42:18] he shall overcome at the last. So Reuben
[42:22] and Gad and half the tribe of Manasseh
[42:24] are uh infamous I guess you would say
[42:26] for one reason and and they really kind
[42:29] of drop off the pages of history. What
[42:32] they're what they're famous for or
[42:33] infamous for is that they failed to
[42:36] cross Jordan. you remember, and go all
[42:39] the way into the promised land. And we
[42:41] dealt with Reuben on that just slightly,
[42:43] but we didn't go very far into the
[42:45] story. I want us to turn to Numbers
[42:47] chapter 32. If you have your Bibles with
[42:48] you
[42:49] tonight, I'm going to read several
[42:51] verses in Numbers chapter 32 and verse
[42:55] one. We'll read down through verse
[42:58] 5. It says, "Now the children of Reuben
[43:01] and the children of Gad had a very great
[43:03] multitude of cattle. And when they saw
[43:05] the land of Jazer and the land of
[43:07] Gilead, behold, the place the place was
[43:10] a place for cattle, the children of Gad
[43:13] and the children of Reuben came and
[43:15] spake unto Moses and to Eleazar the
[43:17] priest and unto the princes of the
[43:19] congregation, saying, and then they list
[43:22] in verse three all the the names of the
[43:23] towns. They said, "Even the country
[43:26] which the Lord spoke before the
[43:27] congregation of Israel is a land for
[43:30] cattle, and thy servants have cattle."
[43:33] So they're out there. If you if you are
[43:35] a cattle person, we grew up uh raising
[43:38] cattle and having around cattle and you
[43:41] always know cattle land when you see it
[43:43] like it's there good grazing land. And
[43:46] so they they looked at that and and and
[43:48] it just looked like the plains, you
[43:50] know, just full of grass and it just
[43:53] looks so good to them. And and and they
[43:55] said, "This is a land for cattle. We
[43:57] have cattle. It just makes sense,
[44:01] right? It makes good sense." And it did.
[44:03] Now, I want you to understand they were
[44:05] right
[44:06] in in in in their knowledge, in their
[44:08] understanding, in their uh in all that
[44:11] they could think of or all that they
[44:13] could dream up in their mind, they were
[44:16] right. That it made sense for them to
[44:19] stay there. But it wasn't what God told
[44:22] them to do. He it wasn't the part that
[44:24] was given to Abraham. So now they said,
[44:28] it it makes sense for us to stay here.
[44:30] Therefore said they, if we have found
[44:32] grace in thy sight, let this land be
[44:34] given to thy servants for possession,
[44:37] and bring us not over Jordan. So they're
[44:40] they're saying, uh, let let's just let
[44:42] us stay here and and and don't bring us
[44:45] over into the full promise of God. This
[44:48] was the same land, interestingly enough,
[44:51] that Lot had seen. You remember when
[44:54] Lot, we don't have time to go in Genesis
[44:56] 19, but you can go read there later,
[44:58] that Lot actually looks out and the
[45:00] Bible says he sees the well-watered
[45:02] plain of Jordan. What was he looking at?
[45:05] He was looking at the exact same land
[45:07] that these tribes were looking at. And
[45:09] he saw that it was it was good for
[45:11] cattle. It was good for sheep. It was
[45:14] good for uh for any number of things to
[45:17] to plant crops on. And and he said,
[45:19] "It's a land that's that's just
[45:21] wonderful. Why do I need a a a promised
[45:24] land full of milk and honey? So, if you
[45:26] could kind of look at it like this, they
[45:27] traded uh what they could see uh for
[45:31] what they couldn't see. And to them,
[45:32] that was a good bargain. It was a bird
[45:34] in the hand, right? It was something
[45:36] they already could see. They could have
[45:38] it. But as Christians, we're not we're
[45:40] not looking at the scene. We're looking
[45:42] at the unseen. We're not looking at what
[45:44] this life has to offer, but we're
[45:46] looking at it very best. It's few days
[45:48] and full of trouble, but we're looking,
[45:50] brother. It's something beyond what we
[45:52] can see and we're looking to something
[45:54] else.
[45:56] So, it was the same land. It had become
[45:59] the plain of Moab. That was the plane of
[46:02] Moab. And that's what Moses had went in
[46:04] and defeated Moab. And they said, "Give
[46:07] us this land." So, it was the plane of
[46:09] Moab, which was Lot's son by by an
[46:12] incestuous relationship with his
[46:14] daughters. And Moab speaks of
[46:16] denomination. Brother Brandham taught us
[46:18] that when he dealt with Moab with Balum.
[46:21] So Moab speaks of denomination. So they
[46:24] settled for a denomination or for a
[46:26] denominational idea instead of going on
[46:29] over into the land that was flowing with
[46:32] milk and honey, the land where all the
[46:34] promises laid. Now, Brother Brandham
[46:36] tells us something interesting about the
[46:37] Moabites. He said the Moabites knew the
[46:40] truth.
[46:42] Oh my. whether they lived up to it or
[46:46] not. I I I gota I I I I've got to preach
[46:51] this a little bit here for a moment
[46:52] because uh we we need to understand that
[46:55] if you know something and you don't do
[46:57] it, that becomes sin. Yeah. And we need
[47:00] what we know. It's important what we
[47:02] know. There's many people who don't know
[47:03] what we know. They've not been exposed
[47:05] to the truth that we've been exposed to,
[47:07] but we have. Yeah. And to take if you
[47:10] know something, if you can read
[47:11] something in the scripture, you can read
[47:13] what the Bible says about something or
[47:15] you you you hear it preached or you hear
[47:17] it on a tape or however it is that the
[47:19] word comes to you. When when you hear it
[47:22] and you don't do it, you don't live up
[47:24] to it, you become like a moabitete. They
[47:26] could hear it, but they didn't live up
[47:28] to it. They heard it. They had the same
[47:31] Bible just like denomination has the
[47:33] same Bible we do. The same Bible that
[47:35] says don't cut your hair. The same Bible
[47:37] that says live in a godly life. The same
[47:39] Bible that says all of the the things
[47:42] that we believe and yet they don't
[47:43] believe it. Why do they not believe it?
[47:45] Because they they know the truth. They
[47:47] have the truth. They have the word of
[47:49] God, but they don't live up to it. Now,
[47:51] in Genesis 13 and verse 10, uh you find
[47:54] where Lot lifted up his eyes. And
[47:56] behold, all the plain of Jordan. It was
[47:58] well watered everywhere before the Lord
[48:00] destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah even as the
[48:03] garden of the Lord like the land of
[48:04] Egypt as thou comest unstar. So it was a
[48:08] beautiful land. It was a it was a
[48:09] wellwatered land. A and so they made the
[48:12] same decision that Lot
[48:15] made and and Abraham made another
[48:18] decision. Abraham went with God into the
[48:21] presence of God. That's the decision I
[48:23] want to make. It might be harder here,
[48:26] but I want to be in the presence of God.
[48:29] I want to be in the will of God, the
[48:30] perfect will of God. I don't want to
[48:32] take his permissive will. He may allow
[48:34] you to do something. He allowed them to
[48:37] live there, but it was not the perfect
[48:39] will of God. You say, "Brother Ben, how
[48:41] could I ever know the perfect will of
[48:43] God?" Well, that's pretty easy. It's the
[48:45] word of God,
[48:47] right? If you've got to ask for special
[48:49] permission,
[48:51] then God don't want you to do it. Well,
[48:54] I know what the Bible says, but God,
[48:56] you're a good God. He may let you do it,
[48:59] but his first word is his correct word,
[49:02] and it'll always be right. He don't
[49:05] change his mind about his word. How many
[49:07] believe that tonight?
[49:11] So, their decision was the same as lost.
[49:13] Numbers chapter 32 again, verse 6. And
[49:16] Moses, he's responding now, said unto
[49:19] the children of Gad, to the children of
[49:20] Reuben, "Shall your brethren go to war,
[49:23] and shall you sit here? And wherefore
[49:26] discourage ye the heart of the children
[49:28] of Israel, from going over into the land
[49:30] which the Lord hath given them?" So
[49:33] their their example would discourage
[49:35] others from going on in, right? He said,
[49:39] "Thus did your fathers when I sent them
[49:42] from Kadesh Barnea to see the land."
[49:45] Notice there's a new generation making
[49:48] the same mistake. We don't want to make
[49:51] the mistakes of a previous generation.
[49:54] There's got to be a generation where the
[49:55] the cycle of revival and death fails,
[49:58] right? There's got to be a generation
[50:00] that steps into a new body. There's got
[50:02] to be a generation that takes a rapture.
[50:04] There's got to be a generation that
[50:05] accepts the message and believes it for
[50:07] what it is and don't let any man
[50:09] interpret it to them. Come on, church.
[50:12] Somebody's got to do it. Yes, sir.
[50:14] Somebody's got to believe the whole word
[50:15] of God. Somebody's got to become that
[50:18] word. Might as well be us,
[50:22] right? It might as well be us. I I don't
[50:24] want to just put that off in the future.
[50:26] Let's let it be us cuz we don't know the
[50:28] the the body change may happen tomorrow.
[50:30] I don't know when it's going to happen,
[50:32] but whenever it is, I'm I I want to be
[50:34] ready for it. I I I want to be ready.
[50:36] Amen. So, I don't want to make the
[50:38] mistakes of my forefathers. They they
[50:40] did their part, but I don't want to be I
[50:43] don't want to be uh my my father's, if
[50:45] you could say it like this, and I've
[50:46] preached on this before, but the genes
[50:48] of my father, the things that he
[50:51] experienced and the things he inherited
[50:52] from his father, they were damaged by
[50:55] Adam's fall, but I've been born again by
[50:58] the spirit of God. I don't have to I
[51:01] don't have to reinterpret my father's
[51:03] life. Brother Brandon said, "I realized
[51:04] one day I was not the son of Charles and
[51:06] Ella Brandon, but I was the son of God.
[51:08] And I've got to realize that I'm not
[51:10] just the son of John and Sharon Puit,
[51:12] but I'm the son of God. So do all of us.
[51:17] And brother Brandon said, "Then I was
[51:19] born again."
[51:21] Amen.
[51:22] So we don't repeat those mistakes. Now
[51:25] he says, "Here, you're doing the same
[51:27] thing what your fathers did." He said,
[51:28] "For when they went up into the valley
[51:30] of Eshkaw and saw the land, they
[51:31] discouraged the heart of the children of
[51:32] Israel that they should not go into the
[51:34] land which the Lord had given them." The
[51:36] Lord's anger was kindled the same time.
[51:38] And he swear, saying, Surely none of the
[51:40] men that came up out of Egypt, from 20
[51:42] years old and upward shall see the land
[51:44] which I swear unto Abraham, unto Isaac,
[51:47] and unto Jacob, because they have not
[51:48] wholly followed me. Save Caleb. I love
[51:52] that. Who's Caleb a type of? Come on.
[51:54] You've read the church age book. Who's
[51:56] Caleb? A type of type of me, a type of
[51:58] you, type of the bride.
[52:01] Amen. And for they have wholly followed
[52:03] the Lord. And the Lord's anger at Caleb
[52:06] the son of Jeff and Joshua the son of
[52:07] Joshua's a type of the end time leader.
[52:09] He said Caleb's a type of the bride. He
[52:11] said for they have wholly followed the
[52:12] Lord. And the Lord's anger was kindled
[52:14] against Israel. And he made them wander
[52:16] in the wilderness 40 years until all the
[52:19] generation that had done evil in the
[52:21] sight of the Lord was consumed. And
[52:23] behold, you are risen up in your
[52:25] father's dead. This is the new
[52:26] generation that was supposed to go all
[52:28] the way into the promises of God. Yes.
[52:31] Right. He said, "You raised up in your
[52:32] father'sstead an increase of sinful
[52:35] men." In other words, your fathers were
[52:37] sinful, and so are you sinful to augment
[52:40] yet the fierce anger of the Lord toward
[52:42] Israel. For if you turn away from after
[52:45] him, he will yet again leave them in the
[52:47] wilderness, and you shall destroy all
[52:50] this people.
[52:52] That's what God thought about what they
[52:53] were doing.
[52:56] And but what they did instead of
[52:58] following what Moses said and saying,
[52:59] "Lord, we're we're sorry,
[53:02] we we didn't realize it was such a big
[53:03] deal,
[53:05] but they made a compromise."
[53:07] And they said, "Well, we'll go fight
[53:09] with
[53:09] you. We'll go help you, but but we'll
[53:13] leave our cattle and little ones behind.
[53:15] We'll we'll build cities for our little
[53:17] ones." Numbers
[53:19] 32:16. Build sheepfolds for our cattle
[53:21] and cities for our little ones. But we
[53:23] ourselves will go ready armed before the
[53:26] children of Israel and and until we have
[53:28] brought them unto their place, unto
[53:30] their place. Notice how they've already
[53:31] separated in their mind that it's a
[53:33] place for somebody but not for me.
[53:37] That's where backsliding begins, church.
[53:40] It's a place for somebody. The message
[53:42] is for somebody but not for me. That's
[53:44] right. That Bible verse was for somebody
[53:46] but not for me. But it's all for all of
[53:49] us. Is that right? Right. So now uh they
[53:53] said we'll not return to our houses
[53:55] until the children of Israel have
[53:56] inherited every man his inheritance for
[53:58] we will not oh my they don't even I
[54:02] don't think they they grasp what a what
[54:03] a huge deal this is. We will not inherit
[54:07] with them on yonder side
[54:10] Jordan be or forward because our
[54:14] inheritance is fallen to us on this side
[54:18] Jordan eastward. What they did is they
[54:20] put a period on what they believed. They
[54:23] said, "This is as far as we're going and
[54:26] we won't go any further. We'll we'll
[54:28] take the first poll and the second poll,
[54:30] but that's as far as we're going." Yeah.
[54:33] We won't go any f any further into the
[54:36] message of the hour. Now, hear me
[54:39] tonight on this. Just because God allows
[54:43] something doesn't make it right.
[54:47] They were operating in what we call his
[54:49] permissive will. Brother Brandham called
[54:51] his permissive will. Proving they were
[54:53] not of those who were predestined to the
[54:56] full promise. But I want to be one who's
[54:59] predestined to the full promise. How do
[55:00] I know that I am? Because I have a
[55:02] desire to go there. I want to see it.
[55:04] Caleb said, "Give me my mountain. I'm
[55:06] not going to stop short of what God has
[55:08] given me." Oh, that could be all of our
[55:11] desire tonight. I I you know, it may be
[55:13] a hard land. You know, sometimes the
[55:15] land that God gives us is difficult.
[55:17] Sometimes we go through great trials.
[55:18] Sometimes we we we go through situations
[55:21] as we talked about here not long ago
[55:22] about Caleb's daughter. She was given a
[55:24] piece of the Ngev desert and and she'd
[55:27] come to her father and she said, "Give
[55:28] me also springs of water. If you've
[55:31] given me a desert place, I've got a life
[55:33] full of trials. Give me an atmosphere of
[55:36] worship. Give me give me a a heart that
[55:38] can receive from you, Lord. Give me
[55:41] peace in my life and in my heart that no
[55:43] matter what comes, I know you'll take
[55:44] care of me. Give me your spirit, Lord.
[55:48] Give me your presence. Oh, how many can
[55:49] say amen to that tonight? My my land may
[55:52] be difficult to take, but I can take it
[55:54] if you go with me.
[55:57] Amen, sir. So, they were they didn't
[56:01] want to go all the way in because it
[56:02] would have been more difficult. Yet they
[56:05] fought with the people of God and then
[56:08] went back. And Moses agreed in Genesis
[56:12] or Numbers
[56:13] 32 20 and and even down to verse we'll
[56:18] read verse 22. He says if you'll do this
[56:20] in verse 22, the land shall be subdued
[56:22] before the Lord. Then afterward you
[56:24] shall return and be guiltless before the
[56:27] Lord before Israel. In other words,
[56:28] you're going to be you'll be saved. You
[56:30] be you know you'll it'll be okay. this
[56:33] land shall be your possession before the
[56:35] Lord. Listen to me. They could find a
[56:38] quote
[56:40] where Moses told him this is your land.
[56:44] But it wasn't what God had called them
[56:46] to originally. We'll find where brother
[56:48] Brandon says that after a while. Joshua
[56:51] 22 and9 the children of Reuben and the
[56:54] children of Gad and the half tribe of
[56:55] Manasseh returned. This is when they got
[56:57] done. They went and fought every battle.
[56:59] Yeah. In fact, they went first to show
[57:01] the others that, you know, hey, we'll go
[57:04] first. We'll go to church. We'll do we
[57:07] we'll we'll we'll do all of this. But
[57:09] their hearts were on the other side of
[57:12] Jordan cuz they left their children
[57:14] there,
[57:16] right? And and because they did that,
[57:18] they they said, "We'll we'll go forward
[57:20] and we'll uh we we'll help you possess
[57:23] your
[57:24] land." A and I thank God for those that
[57:27] will help. But all that we could,
[57:29] everyone, each one of us would be those
[57:32] who want to stay in the promises of God.
[57:35] Not just to visit the land, not just to
[57:37] see the grapes, not just to experience
[57:40] the land flowing with milk and honey,
[57:42] but that we would actually stay there.
[57:46] Oh my. They, it says, they departed from
[57:49] the children of Israel, out of Shiloh,
[57:53] which is in the land of Canaan, to go
[57:56] into the country of Gilead, to the land
[57:59] of their possession. Remember, it was
[58:02] the land of Moab. It was it was Lot's
[58:06] possession, what he wanted, not what
[58:08] Abraham got. To the land of their
[58:10] possession, whereof they were possessed
[58:12] according to the word of the Lord by the
[58:15] hand of Moses. Moses said, "Go do it."
[58:18] But it wasn't his perfect will.
[58:20] They could say God allowed it, but it
[58:22] was not his original plan. So, Brother
[58:24] Brandham has a vision. And and again, I
[58:27] want to I want to make this very clear
[58:29] tonight. What is the original plan? This
[58:31] is it.
[58:32] Right? If you can't find it here and
[58:36] then revealed in the message of the
[58:38] hour, right? It's not his perfect will.
[58:41] It can't be.
[58:43] It has to line up. No matter what
[58:45] anybody else says, you say, "But they're
[58:48] they're Christians." Yes, they they do
[58:50] good things. Absolutely. But they're not
[58:52] in the perfect will of God. And for me
[58:54] in my house, we want to serve the Lord.
[58:57] If it seems good to you to serve
[58:59] somebody else or to stay on the other
[59:00] side of Jordan, that's fine. But for me
[59:02] in my house, yes, let me serve the Lord.
[59:06] Oh, that we could have drive that kind
[59:07] of stake down today. Yes. Make that kind
[59:10] of commitment. Yes. Brother Brandham has
[59:13] a
[59:13] vision and the second part of the vision
[59:16] is you you'll you'll recognize more
[59:19] quickly because it's the part where
[59:21] death is defeated, right? The the mamba,
[59:24] the black mamba. This is from the
[59:26] message paradox in 1961. So the second
[59:29] part of the vision is where brother
[59:31] Brandham defeats black mamba, which was
[59:32] a type of death, right? And he tells him
[59:35] this and anything under it, right? He
[59:38] said when the when the snake died, it
[59:40] made like an S. He said it was an and
[59:42] sign, a backwards S. He said it's this
[59:44] and anything under it, right? Is
[59:47] defeated, right? He had power over it.
[59:51] But the first part of the vision is
[59:52] this. He said, I'd gotten up and I
[59:54] looked where in front of me I was coming
[59:56] down to the Jordan. Looked like I was
[59:58] standing on the map of Palestine. He
[1:00:00] said, I was coming down to the Jordan
[1:00:02] and it seemed like I could hear the
[1:00:04] song, I'm going down to the Jordan. and
[1:00:06] someone was singing it. And as I drew
[1:00:08] near the river, I looked back and seen
[1:00:10] which way I had come and I was 2third of
[1:00:14] the way there to the Jordan. He said,
[1:00:17] "And I looked across Jordan and I said,
[1:00:19] "Oh, praise God." Just on the other side
[1:00:23] is where all the promises
[1:00:26] lay. Every promise lays in the promised
[1:00:29] land. And I know there's many in the
[1:00:31] message that feel like we're still
[1:00:32] there, that we're still on that side of
[1:00:35] the river looking across. But I believe
[1:00:37] that brother Brandon's new ministry, I
[1:00:39] believe we can back this up with the
[1:00:41] message. His new ministry was the
[1:00:43] opening of the seals and the opening of
[1:00:46] the word. And that was he said that was
[1:00:48] the uh the the mysteries contained in
[1:00:50] the seals. And he said, I I have to give
[1:00:52] my attention to this message. There just
[1:00:54] so many quotes and things that he said.
[1:00:56] So that is uh that being his new
[1:00:58] ministry, he said it would be much
[1:00:59] greater than the previous two. That
[1:01:02] being the third poll, he said told us
[1:01:04] you you can type it in and search it up.
[1:01:05] He said the third pole is the opening of
[1:01:07] the word. Right? So that is the third
[1:01:11] the third step if you might say. That's
[1:01:13] the land where all the promises lay is
[1:01:15] in this message. We don't have to have
[1:01:17] another one. We don't have to have
[1:01:18] somebody come back and preach it again.
[1:01:20] We don't have to have any of that. We
[1:01:22] got everything that we need right in the
[1:01:24] message of it. Oh, I'm so thankful for
[1:01:26] that. Listen, don't let any man tell you
[1:01:28] that you you got to listen to him to
[1:01:30] make it. That's right. There is not a
[1:01:32] man on the earth that you have to listen
[1:01:34] to to make it. This message was provided
[1:01:36] for you. He said, "Behold, I send you
[1:01:39] Elijah the prophet, sir, before the
[1:01:41] coming of the great and dreadful day of
[1:01:42] the Lord, and he shall turn the hearts
[1:01:44] of the children back to the fathers." Oh
[1:01:47] my, my heart's been turned back. I've
[1:01:50] entered into the land.
[1:01:52] I don't want to stay back. I don't want
[1:01:54] to leave something behind that makes my
[1:01:56] heart want to go back where it was. I
[1:01:58] don't want to just fight and then give
[1:01:59] up. But if I fight, let me possess what
[1:02:02] I'm fighting for. Come on. Yes, sir.
[1:02:06] Good.
[1:02:08] If I'm going to go to church, let me
[1:02:09] possess it.
[1:02:11] Come on, church. If I'm going to be a
[1:02:13] message believer, let me possess it. Let
[1:02:15] me understand it. Let me dig into it.
[1:02:17] Let me let me not just rely on what
[1:02:19] somebody says, but let me have it for
[1:02:20] myself.
[1:02:27] Absolutely. He said, "Every promise,
[1:02:30] every promise lays in the promised
[1:02:33] land." See, death was conquered on the
[1:02:37] other side of the Jordan. Yeah. That was
[1:02:41] the land of the resurrection.
[1:02:44] The land that Lot chose was a land of
[1:02:47] backsiding, a land of denomination, a
[1:02:50] land of unfulfilled promises, a land of
[1:02:52] the here and now, a land that looked
[1:02:54] good and maybe maybe it made you a
[1:02:56] little more money and and things would
[1:02:58] go a little bit easier in your life, but
[1:02:59] but it's not a land of the of the
[1:03:01] rapture. But the the promised land is a
[1:03:04] rapture land. It's a land of the body
[1:03:06] change. It's a land of the spoken word.
[1:03:09] It's Oh, come on, church. It's a land of
[1:03:11] the voice of the resurrection is in the
[1:03:13] promised land. Yeah. So those who stayed
[1:03:17] across Jordan kept this attitude like we
[1:03:21] don't want nothing to upset what we're
[1:03:23] doing now. And they kept it all the way
[1:03:26] down to Jesus' time because in Jesus'
[1:03:29] time they had, you know how things kind
[1:03:32] of devolve? When you go when you
[1:03:33] backslide, you don't just stay, you just
[1:03:35] keep going, right? And and by Jesus
[1:03:37] time, they no longer hurted cattle. They
[1:03:39] hurted hogs,
[1:03:42] right? They rationalized it because it's
[1:03:44] for other people, not for us Jews. You
[1:03:46] know, nothing wrong with bacon now.
[1:03:48] That's all right. You know, thank God
[1:03:50] for that. Thank God for the blood and
[1:03:52] the death of Jesus on the
[1:03:55] cross. I'm so glad brother Brandham ate
[1:03:57] bacon, you know, and I can eat bacon,
[1:03:58] too. Praise God.
[1:04:01] But the Jews weren't supposed to, right?
[1:04:04] And so they were they had hogs they
[1:04:05] couldn't even
[1:04:07] eat. Had a bunch of pigs they couldn't
[1:04:10] even eat. And in Jesus' time, they'd
[1:04:12] become pig herders. Oh my. And brother
[1:04:16] Brandham says this. He said, he said,
[1:04:18] "Look, when Israel was dividing up their
[1:04:20] lands." Now, this is a very important
[1:04:22] quote because it tells us about this
[1:04:24] tribe that stayed, these tribes that
[1:04:27] stayed, the two and a half tribes. He
[1:04:29] said there was, I believe it was Gad was
[1:04:32] one of them and perhaps the half tribe.
[1:04:35] They didn't go over into the promised
[1:04:37] land. They stayed on this side
[1:04:40] borderline. Yeah. Jesus visit that same
[1:04:45] people.
[1:04:47] And look at the results. I just love the
[1:04:50] way he put it of staying out of the full
[1:04:53] benefits of God's love.
[1:04:56] Look at the results of it.
[1:04:59] Every I'm not very old. I'm 39 years
[1:05:01] old. I'll be 40 this year. And I've seen
[1:05:03] just about everything made out of this
[1:05:05] message. Every kind of a doctrine, every
[1:05:07] kind of a dogma. But can I preach to you
[1:05:09] my heart tonight? I've seen the failure
[1:05:11] of all those things. I see what it does
[1:05:13] to homes. I see what it does to
[1:05:14] children. I see what it does to people.
[1:05:17] Destroys people.
[1:05:19] Oh my. Why? They all stayed over here in
[1:05:22] man's ideas. But let me go on over.
[1:05:26] Let me go over to the fullness. He said
[1:05:28] out. They were staying out of the full
[1:05:30] benefits. Yes. Of God's love.
[1:05:34] Oh, I want the full benefit of his love.
[1:05:36] Don't you? I need his forgiveness. I
[1:05:38] need his grace. I need to feel his
[1:05:40] power. I need his presence to be around.
[1:05:42] I need the church. I need I need
[1:05:44] communion. I need to be with you. I I I
[1:05:47] need that. I need what the Bible says. I
[1:05:49] need the the gifts of the spirit when
[1:05:51] they're in order. I need all of these
[1:05:53] things. I need the whole word of God.
[1:05:56] Amen. As it was given to us by the
[1:05:59] prophet in this day. I need it. Yeah.
[1:06:03] I need the full benefit of God's love.
[1:06:05] You do as well. When Jesus visited them,
[1:06:08] he went over in Gera. Remember when he
[1:06:11] was coming across the sea? We just
[1:06:12] preached on it and 10,000 demons of the
[1:06:14] sea swore they'd kill him. They'd drown
[1:06:16] him. He put his foot up on the brow of
[1:06:18] the boat. They woke him up. Master,
[1:06:21] don't you care about us? Put his foot up
[1:06:23] on the brow of the boat and said, "Peace
[1:06:24] be still." He can still do that, church.
[1:06:28] He's still the one that can do that. He
[1:06:29] can still speak to your life. Say,
[1:06:31] "Peace be still." He's still the word.
[1:06:34] He's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:06:36] forever. But he crossed over for a
[1:06:38] purpose. He told them, "We're going to
[1:06:40] the other side." And they were going
[1:06:41] over to meet a man named Legion.
[1:06:45] A man who who had a legion of demons. He
[1:06:48] said, "Call us Legion cuz we're many."
[1:06:51] And and and that's where on the other
[1:06:53] side is where these people were living.
[1:06:57] He said, "That's where they come from."
[1:06:59] That tribe that stayed, their attitude
[1:07:01] was still the same way because it cost
[1:07:05] them a bunch of hogs to have the
[1:07:06] meeting. Remember what happened? the
[1:07:09] hogs. You remember the devil said,
[1:07:11] "Don't just cast us out. Send us
[1:07:12] somewhere." Because they can't do
[1:07:14] nothing without permission.
[1:07:17] Right? So they said, "Send us
[1:07:18] somewhere." And what did the hogs the
[1:07:20] devils do? They went into the hogs.
[1:07:22] Brother Brandham said the the the devils
[1:07:24] had fits and the hogs had fits and they
[1:07:26] drowned the people in in the in the
[1:07:28] water or they drowned the hogs rather in
[1:07:31] the water. And because it cost them a
[1:07:32] herd of hogs,
[1:07:34] the people come to Jesus. They said,
[1:07:36] "Don't stay with us.
[1:07:38] What was it? The same attitude they had
[1:07:40] with Joshua and with Moses. Let us stay
[1:07:42] here. Yeah. We're comfortable. We're
[1:07:45] complacent. We're happy where we are,
[1:07:47] but I want everything God has for me. I
[1:07:49] want to keep on pushing and keep on
[1:07:51] pressing and keep on doing everything
[1:07:53] God called me to do.
[1:07:58] Now look, he said, because it cost them
[1:08:00] a bunch of hogs to have the meeting,
[1:08:01] they asked Jesus to leave their land.
[1:08:03] They didn't want nothing to do with it.
[1:08:05] They had their own ways. They had their
[1:08:07] own churches. They didn't want nothing
[1:08:09] to do with Jesus. So they asked him to
[1:08:11] leave the land. What did they do? They
[1:08:14] rejected the fullness of the word.
[1:08:15] Brother Random says in one place that
[1:08:16] the foolish virgin rejects the fullness
[1:08:19] of the atonement.
[1:08:21] It goes into the tribulation
[1:08:23] period. They rejected the fullness. What
[1:08:26] was the fullness? Christ.
[1:08:28] Colossians 2:9, for in him. Someone say
[1:08:30] it with me. In him. I know it's
[1:08:32] Wednesday night and you're tired, but
[1:08:33] we're just going to go a little bit
[1:08:35] longer tonight. And I won't hold you all
[1:08:36] night. I promise. In him dwelleth all.
[1:08:39] Someone say all. All the fullness of the
[1:08:42] godhead bodily. They they were very
[1:08:46] religious but they rejected the word in
[1:08:49] its fullness revealed the word made
[1:08:52] flesh. Yes. Joshua 22:10, the Bible says
[1:08:56] that this these two and a half tribes
[1:08:58] when they were coming to the borders of
[1:09:00] Jordan that are in the land of Canaan
[1:09:02] and the children of Reuben and the
[1:09:03] children of Gad and the half tribe of
[1:09:05] Manasseh built there an altar by Jordan,
[1:09:08] a great altar to see to, right? It
[1:09:11] looked good. It was beautiful. It was
[1:09:14] huge. It made sense.
[1:09:18] But it was not ordained by God. Yeah.
[1:09:23] If you think now, we know that
[1:09:26] denomination did that. If you think
[1:09:27] about the church, you don't think of a
[1:09:30] lotments given to a certain tribe or
[1:09:32] even a certain denomination, but to an
[1:09:34] age. Yeah. Right. A certain light given
[1:09:37] to a certain age.
[1:09:40] So, Brother Brandham, and and I'll read
[1:09:42] that again at the end of that quote I
[1:09:43] read at the beginning. He said, "Each
[1:09:45] age has had its allotment of word to be
[1:09:48] fulfilled." Each
[1:09:50] age. And I want to ask you tonight, if
[1:09:53] we've come to the age of the fullness of
[1:09:56] Christ, the son of man again. Yeah.
[1:10:00] Right. He said it would be son of God,
[1:10:01] son of man, son of God, son of David. He
[1:10:04] said, but right before the gospel goes
[1:10:06] back to the Jews, the son of man would
[1:10:07] be revealed again. Right. And it has
[1:10:10] been revealed in our hour. After we have
[1:10:13] come to that, why would we want to go
[1:10:15] back to denominational pastures?
[1:10:19] After fighting for that all of these
[1:10:21] years,
[1:10:23] why would we want to go back to being
[1:10:25] told by men what we can do and what we
[1:10:27] can't do? Why would we go back to a
[1:10:29] denominational system
[1:10:32] when we've been released in the freedom
[1:10:34] of the new land? when we've been led by
[1:10:36] our Joshua into the new land and we have
[1:10:39] the Holy Ghost here with us and things
[1:10:41] are we've been given a a land. Yeah.
[1:10:45] Why would we go back? Amen.
[1:10:48] Now, you know, they come and they said,
[1:10:50] "Well, you know, the Pentecostals were
[1:10:52] satisfied because they said, "We have
[1:10:54] justification. We have sanctification,
[1:10:55] the gifts of the spirit." And they did.
[1:10:58] But that wasn't all of it, right? But it
[1:11:00] was a shock. And brother Brandon said,
[1:11:02] "We'll not be heir with the bride." I'm
[1:11:05] moving fast through this tonight, but
[1:11:06] you can go study all of this. Who
[1:11:08] receives all the promises of God? Now,
[1:11:11] look, why did Gad stay across the land?
[1:11:14] Why did they stay? because that's where
[1:11:17] they could be successful. Yeah. I just
[1:11:20] want
[1:11:21] to I just want to dwell on this for a
[1:11:24] moment. Lot had success in Sodom.
[1:11:29] Do you know that? Brother Brandham said
[1:11:30] he'd become the mayor of the city.
[1:11:33] He was successful up to the point that
[1:11:36] his wife was turned into a pillar of
[1:11:38] salt.
[1:11:41] Look at Moses blessing of Gad.
[1:11:45] He said of Gad, he said in Deuteronomy
[1:11:47] 33:20, where Moses blesses the 12
[1:11:49] tribes, he said, "Blessed be he that
[1:11:53] enlargeth Gad." He dwelleth as a lion,
[1:11:56] tearthth the arm with the crown of the
[1:11:57] head. Very
[1:11:59] successful. He provided the first part
[1:12:03] for
[1:12:04] himself. I want you to notice that
[1:12:07] because we in our own efforts, we trying
[1:12:09] to we're trying to make sure that we,
[1:12:12] you know, find what we should be doing
[1:12:13] in life. And I want you young people to
[1:12:15] listen to me tonight because we we
[1:12:17] think, well, I'll I'll do this with my
[1:12:19] life. I'm going to be this or that or
[1:12:20] the other. But maybe God wants you to do
[1:12:22] something else.
[1:12:24] We need to listen for the will of God.
[1:12:26] We need to we need to find the purpose
[1:12:28] of God in our life because we we know
[1:12:32] that we don't want to provide the first
[1:12:34] part for
[1:12:35] ourselves. We don't want to just pick a
[1:12:38] spot and say that's mine. I didn't call
[1:12:41] myself to preach. I can't call myself to
[1:12:44] preach. I didn't call myself to pastor.
[1:12:47] Right? And that's why brother Brandon
[1:12:48] says if you look at somebody that really
[1:12:49] wants the job, that's probably somebody
[1:12:51] shouldn't be doing it.
[1:12:53] Right? And if you realize what the job
[1:12:55] was, you sure wouldn't want the job.
[1:12:59] But I don't want a part that's not mine.
[1:13:01] I want everything God's given me, but
[1:13:04] not nothing else.
[1:13:06] But but Gad provided the first part for
[1:13:09] himself because there a portion of the
[1:13:10] lawgiver was he seated. He came with the
[1:13:12] heads of the people. He executed the
[1:13:14] justice of the Lord and his judgments
[1:13:16] with Israel. Are you still with me
[1:13:17] tonight?
[1:13:20] A good illustration of this is the rich
[1:13:21] young ruler,
[1:13:24] right? Brother Brandham tells the story
[1:13:26] about it in leadership. He says, you
[1:13:28] know what the Bible says about this
[1:13:30] young fellow? He become more
[1:13:33] successful. When did he become more
[1:13:35] successful? After rejecting the fullness
[1:13:39] of the word. after rejecting the
[1:13:42] fullness of being a follower of Christ,
[1:13:46] he he asked Jesus, he said, "What what
[1:13:48] can I do to be saved?" And he said,
[1:13:50] "Well," he said, "Obey all the
[1:13:52] commandments." He said, "I've done all
[1:13:53] that from my youth up."
[1:13:56] And he had great success in that. It
[1:13:59] taught him. He probably paid his tithe
[1:14:01] and went to church and did all the
[1:14:02] things he was supposed to do. But when
[1:14:04] it come time to accept the word in its
[1:14:06] fullness, he was unwilling to do it.
[1:14:09] Brother Brandon says, "You know what the
[1:14:10] Bible says about this young fellow? He
[1:14:12] become more successful."
[1:14:15] Sometimes success doesn't mean that you
[1:14:17] made the right choice. I know sometimes
[1:14:18] we make decisions and then we wait on
[1:14:20] God or we make a decision without
[1:14:22] consulting God. Then we wait on God to
[1:14:24] say no.
[1:14:26] And that's not the way to do it. Ask
[1:14:29] first before you get married. Pray about
[1:14:31] it. Before you go to church somewhere,
[1:14:34] pray about it. Ask first. Don't wait on
[1:14:36] You say, "Well, I'm successful. It must
[1:14:37] have been okay with God. No, he may give
[1:14:39] you his blessing. Yeah. You may feel
[1:14:42] good about it, right? And it still not
[1:14:44] be the will of God. Right. Brother
[1:14:47] Brandon said, "So sometimes success
[1:14:48] don't mean that you've made the right
[1:14:49] choice." You know what he did? He went
[1:14:52] out and had all big times and throw big
[1:14:54] parties and spent lots of money and
[1:14:55] everything on the girls and everything.
[1:14:57] Then he got married, maybe had a family,
[1:14:59] and he just increased so much he had to
[1:15:01] build new barns. And he said, "You see,
[1:15:04] I didn't follow Jesus and look what I
[1:15:06] got. You may hear people say that and I
[1:15:09] he said and I have well look he's
[1:15:11] blessed me that don't mean it at all.
[1:15:13] After a while his barn swelled till even
[1:15:15] he said why soul take your rest. I've
[1:15:18] got so much money and so much success
[1:15:20] and I'm such a great man. I belong to
[1:15:22] all the clubs and I have the riches of
[1:15:24] the world in my hands. I own great sum
[1:15:26] sums of land and sums of money. Why my
[1:15:28] there everybody likes me a very fine
[1:15:30] person to be. But you know the Bible
[1:15:32] said that night God said to him, "I'm
[1:15:35] going to require your soul." And there
[1:15:37] will come a day when our soul is
[1:15:39] required. But we don't have to be
[1:15:41] afraid. Let's just follow the word
[1:15:42] fully. Let's just follow all the way
[1:15:44] across Jordan. Let's do everything.
[1:15:47] Let's be everything he's called us to
[1:15:48] be.
[1:15:50] Yes. Brother Brandham said the rich
[1:15:52] young ruler was led by the influence of
[1:15:55] his success. That's right. His success
[1:15:58] influenced him away from Jesus. Yeah. I
[1:16:03] I want to look at that last church and
[1:16:05] we got just a few more minutes. The last
[1:16:07] church age was the Pentecostal church
[1:16:09] age, right? And we are the overcomer of
[1:16:12] that age. Not another age, but the bride
[1:16:14] part of that, overcomer of that. So the
[1:16:18] Pentecostal church started as a tiny
[1:16:21] little group in Topeka and in on Isusa
[1:16:26] Street. And if you look at what they are
[1:16:28] today, by every standard of man, they've
[1:16:32] been very successful. Yeah. I was
[1:16:36] reading an article on
[1:16:38] Christianisinstitute.org for and it said
[1:16:40] that recently Life magazine listing the
[1:16:43] top 100 events of the second millennium
[1:16:46] put Pentecostalism at 68th. That's the
[1:16:50] top 100 events, not religious events,
[1:16:53] events. The dictionary of Christianity
[1:16:55] in America says that Pentecostalism is
[1:16:58] perhaps the single most significant
[1:17:00] development in 20th century
[1:17:02] Christianity.
[1:17:04] The largest church in the world is a
[1:17:06] Pentecostal
[1:17:08] church in
[1:17:10] Korea.
[1:17:12] 240,000 attend weekly worship. That's a
[1:17:16] big
[1:17:18] church. Someone asked me, you got a big
[1:17:20] church or a small church? I hate that
[1:17:22] question.
[1:17:25] We are a part a portion of the bride,
[1:17:29] right, that lives in Hardy. Somebody
[1:17:30] say, "Well, what should I do?" You know,
[1:17:32] where should I go to church? Well, you
[1:17:33] should go to church where you live,
[1:17:36] and then if you got options, praise God.
[1:17:37] Brother Brandon said, "Pray, right? And
[1:17:39] seek the mind of the Lord and and find a
[1:17:41] church." But you say, "Well, if I leave,
[1:17:44] will you be upset? I'll be sorry to see
[1:17:45] you go, but I ain't going to be mad at
[1:17:47] you." Huh? Because nobody has to listen
[1:17:50] to me preach to make it.
[1:17:52] But in the message, by this standard, we
[1:17:54] don't have any successful churches.
[1:17:58] Right?
[1:17:59] 240,000
[1:18:01] people. Bet they don't have any trouble
[1:18:03] finding a sound man. Brother
[1:18:08] Peter, two Pentec Peter would rather
[1:18:11] play drums than than do sound, but he
[1:18:13] does a good job. Two Pentecostal
[1:18:16] churches in Buenos Aerys attract
[1:18:19] together 150,000 each
[1:18:22] week. Pentecostalism has become the
[1:18:24] fastest growing family world
[1:18:26] Christianity. It's growing at a rate of
[1:18:28] 13 million a year. 35,000 people a day
[1:18:31] become
[1:18:32] Pentecostal with nearly a half a billion
[1:18:36] people just Pentecostals. It is after
[1:18:39] Roman Catholicism the largest Christian
[1:18:43] tradition. That ought to tell them
[1:18:45] something right there.
[1:18:47] Huh? But look what brother Brandham says
[1:18:49] about the Pentecostal age in in the
[1:18:51] church age book and you'll find he's
[1:18:52] talking specifically about the
[1:18:54] Pentecostal church. He said she counts
[1:18:57] numbers for success rather than to look
[1:19:00] for fruit.
[1:19:03] They feel safe in their numbers. But
[1:19:05] God, let us look for fruit. Let us look
[1:19:08] for growth. Let's not look for just
[1:19:10] growth in numbers, but let's look I I
[1:19:12] would love to have a church just packed
[1:19:14] out tonight, but let's look for fruit.
[1:19:17] We realize in this age, not everybody's
[1:19:18] going to believe the message. Not
[1:19:20] everybody's going to live it. Even in
[1:19:21] the church, you'll have three kinds of
[1:19:22] believers. But somebody's going to
[1:19:25] because we read where he said there will
[1:19:26] be a church without spot or wrinkle.
[1:19:32] Now see they they took God's permissive
[1:19:34] will. They stopped. So we love the
[1:19:37] miracles. We love to speak in tongues.
[1:19:40] We love to do that. But we just don't
[1:19:42] want to know what's on the other side.
[1:19:44] We'd rather take the known instead of
[1:19:46] the unknown. But there's so much more on
[1:19:48] the other side of the sound barrier.
[1:19:50] Don't let me What if What if people had
[1:19:52] said scientists and said, "Well, let's
[1:19:53] just never let's never break the sound
[1:19:55] barrier. Let's stay down here where it's
[1:19:56] comfortable. Let's stay down here where
[1:19:58] we're happy and every we got flight now.
[1:20:00] We can fly around our airplanes." But
[1:20:02] somebody had to have a dream and a
[1:20:03] vision to be able to say, "Let's go
[1:20:05] beyond the sound barrier." And in this
[1:20:07] age, we're not called to be pilots.
[1:20:09] We're called to be astronauts.
[1:20:12] Hallelujah.
[1:20:13] Amen. The pilot goes wherever he wants
[1:20:15] to, but the astronaut goes where where
[1:20:18] he's sent. Amen. He flies beyond the
[1:20:20] sound barrier. Yeah. And he goes out
[1:20:23] into the
[1:20:24] unknown. Look, they took God's
[1:20:27] permissive will. Brother Brandon said,
[1:20:28] "Any move from that original plan of God
[1:20:31] throws the whole thing out of cater,
[1:20:33] right? We can't move from that original
[1:20:36] word, right?" He said, we talked about
[1:20:37] it on Balum. He got God's answer
[1:20:39] straight and clear. Don't go. But he has
[1:20:41] a permissive will. You can work in that
[1:20:43] if you wish to, and God will make it
[1:20:44] honor him. But still, it's not God's
[1:20:47] perfect will. And that's what we should
[1:20:49] strive for, his perfect will, not his
[1:20:51] permissive will. The kingdom of God
[1:20:53] within the earth today can never be set
[1:20:55] up justly on a permissive will. It's got
[1:20:57] to come back to his perfect will. You
[1:21:00] realize I know people, you say, "Well,
[1:21:02] I'm still in the will of God." Well, the
[1:21:04] fall of man was in his permissive will.
[1:21:08] I don't want that. I don't want that
[1:21:10] will. I want his perfect will. I don't
[1:21:12] want what Eve got. I don't want death
[1:21:14] and misery and all those things. I don't
[1:21:16] want the tribulation period. I want what
[1:21:18] he wants for me. I've got something in
[1:21:20] my heart. I trust there's something in
[1:21:22] your heart tonight that says, I want to
[1:21:23] go all the way into the promises of God.
[1:21:26] I want to go all the way into the
[1:21:27] rapture. Brother Brandon said, if I
[1:21:28] can't make it in my generation, don't
[1:21:30] let me stand in the way of somebody else
[1:21:33] having the faith to do it.
[1:21:36] Hallelujah. His perfect will is the
[1:21:40] fullness of the word. Brother Brandham
[1:21:42] taught us about the seed and Mary he
[1:21:46] said was the shuck and I I'm not reading
[1:21:48] all of this because I don't have time
[1:21:49] tonight but you can go back and find the
[1:21:51] quotes. He said Luther had justification
[1:21:53] Wesley had sanctification Pentecostals
[1:21:55] and the restoration of the gifts but
[1:21:57] when the word come he said they could
[1:21:59] produce that that justification will
[1:22:02] save a man. He said you believe that
[1:22:04] sure it was a carrier of the word just
[1:22:05] the same as I believe the stalk is part
[1:22:06] of the weed. Sure but it's the carrier
[1:22:08] ain't it ain't the life right? He said
[1:22:11] then along came sanctification. How many
[1:22:12] believes in sanctification? We believe
[1:22:14] in it. He said you believe the Bible you
[1:22:16] have to. Sure. So still that's not it's
[1:22:18] a little more like that's two more
[1:22:19] words. He said but then come the
[1:22:21] Pentecost the restoration of the gifts
[1:22:23] speaking in tongues. They're they call
[1:22:24] that the initial evidence which brought
[1:22:26] forth what? The shuck. But they
[1:22:28] denominated. But when you come to say I
[1:22:30] and my father are one and these other
[1:22:33] things then the shuck pulls away from
[1:22:34] it. Listen. But the real genuine bride
[1:22:38] church will bring forth the entire word
[1:22:41] of God in its fullness and in its
[1:22:43] strength. For he's the same yesterday,
[1:22:45] today, and forever. Don't try to talk me
[1:22:47] out of an Acts 2:38 experience. Don't
[1:22:49] try to talk me out of my children being
[1:22:51] saved. Don't try to talk me out of of
[1:22:55] the of Ephesians 4 or or any part of the
[1:22:58] Bible. I don't want to be talked out of
[1:23:00] it because I believe that's my land. God
[1:23:02] gave it all to me by the opening of the
[1:23:04] word. Brother said, "The Bible become a
[1:23:06] new book." And because of that, let me
[1:23:08] live it all. Let me live it all. I know
[1:23:10] everybody wants to say, "Well, if I
[1:23:11] could cut not cut my hair and and if I
[1:23:14] could wear a long dress, but let me live
[1:23:16] and joy and peace and longsuffering and
[1:23:18] let me live in the inner man as well."
[1:23:20] Not just an outward religion.
[1:23:23] Let me go all the way in. How many can
[1:23:25] say amen to that tonight? Let me go all
[1:23:27] the way in.
[1:23:29] Not just look good,
[1:23:32] go through emotion, but go all the way
[1:23:35] into the promises of God. Yes. Look, are
[1:23:38] you still with me? I got just I got nine
[1:23:41] more
[1:23:43] minutes. That's a dangerous thing to
[1:23:47] say. Ephesians 1 tells us he has
[1:23:49] abounded toward us in all wisdom and
[1:23:51] prudence, having made known unto us.
[1:23:55] Say, what is the perfect will of God?
[1:23:56] He's made known unto us the mystery of
[1:23:58] his will according to his good pleasure
[1:24:01] which he has purposed in
[1:24:04] himself. Listen, his his will is
[1:24:08] himself. Oh my, it's him. I don't want
[1:24:11] his just his gifts. I want him. Yeah. I
[1:24:15] don't want just his blessings. I want
[1:24:17] him.
[1:24:20] Amen. Orpa had a part. Naomi had a part.
[1:24:23] But Ruth got him. Yeah. Ruth got Boaz.
[1:24:26] Let me have him. I want all of him.
[1:24:30] Amen.
[1:24:31] Hallelujah. He said he had made known
[1:24:34] unto us the mystery of his will. That in
[1:24:36] the dispensation of the fullness of
[1:24:38] times, he might gather together in one
[1:24:41] all things in Christ, both which are in
[1:24:44] heaven, which are on earth, even in him.
[1:24:46] In whom? Where? Where is our
[1:24:47] inheritance, church? Where is our land?
[1:24:49] Where is it? It's in him. That's why
[1:24:51] death doesn't shake us. That's why
[1:24:54] tribulation doesn't shake us. That's why
[1:24:56] not having any money in the bank account
[1:24:58] doesn't shake us. Why? Because we have
[1:25:00] been predestined and obtained an
[1:25:02] inheritance in him. My inheritance is in
[1:25:06] the word. And so nothing can change
[1:25:09] that. Are you with me now? My
[1:25:11] inheritance is not subject to your
[1:25:13] interpretation, right? Or even to my own
[1:25:16] interpretation,
[1:25:17] but it's God's interpretation. Yes.
[1:25:21] Hallelujah. It's in him, the fullness,
[1:25:24] that we should be to the praise of his
[1:25:27] glory. We first trusted in Christ. Our
[1:25:29] inheritance is in the fullness of him.
[1:25:30] Our inheritance is not in the plane of
[1:25:32] Moab. Brother Brandham says, "What do
[1:25:35] you say about you Pentecostals? Oh,
[1:25:36] bless God, brother Brandon. We got the
[1:25:37] fullness when we spoke in tongues." You
[1:25:39] didn't.
[1:25:41] He said, "That's exactly right. You look
[1:25:42] it in the face." He said, "That's not
[1:25:44] the way he manifested himself back there
[1:25:45] to the church." Although he does speak
[1:25:48] through tonesues. I believe in speaking
[1:25:50] in tongues, interpretation of tongues,
[1:25:51] but that's not all of it.
[1:25:54] What they had was gifts, but they were
[1:25:56] out of order. Right? What we have is the
[1:25:58] fullness and order. Why would we want to
[1:26:00] go back to chaos? There was a moment
[1:26:03] when God spoke and said, "Let there be
[1:26:05] light and order be to come out of
[1:26:07] chaos." And when he got done speaking,
[1:26:09] the world was perfect.
[1:26:11] The earth was perfect. Why would we want
[1:26:14] to go back into chaos? Listen to me,
[1:26:18] church. God has brought a new creation
[1:26:20] spiritually now in our day. What has he
[1:26:22] done with the bride? He's spoken the
[1:26:24] word into our age and he's making
[1:26:26] himself. He's creating himself. Why
[1:26:28] would we want to go back into
[1:26:29] Pentecostalism?
[1:26:31] We don't want to. We want to go forward.
[1:26:34] And that's not a knock-on emotion. I
[1:26:36] wish we had more emotion.
[1:26:38] I think if you if if you can get
[1:26:40] emotional at the ball game, you can get
[1:26:42] emotional in church. Praise God. Right.
[1:26:45] There's just something about it when you
[1:26:46] when you hear the promises of God, there
[1:26:48] ought to be a stimulation of revelation
[1:26:50] among us. But he didn't say don't have
[1:26:53] emotion. But he said wait till the
[1:26:54] fullness comes in. Come on. Right? He
[1:26:57] said wait till that satisfaction comes.
[1:26:59] The satisfaction portion of the fullness
[1:27:01] of the Holy Spirit comes in. Then these
[1:27:03] joy bells of shouting and speaking in
[1:27:05] tongues and dancing in the spirit will
[1:27:07] come. Yeah. He said, "You won't have to
[1:27:09] do it by the music. You'll do it when
[1:27:10] you're going down the road in your car.
[1:27:12] You'll do it when you're sweeping the
[1:27:14] floor. You'll do it when you're driving
[1:27:15] nails in the wall with carpentry work.
[1:27:17] He said, "Wherever you are, that joy
[1:27:19] unspeakable and full of glory."
[1:27:21] Hallelujah.
[1:27:22] Oh, I thank God that there's something
[1:27:24] beyond just getting worked up in church,
[1:27:26] but there's a there's a joy in my soul.
[1:27:28] When I hear the word, something happens
[1:27:30] to me. Yes, sir. Good. Now, let's just
[1:27:36] make the rubber meet the road for a
[1:27:37] minute and we'll
[1:27:39] close. I've seen folks who fought for
[1:27:43] years
[1:27:45] to help the message, paid their
[1:27:47] tithes, served in church on church
[1:27:50] boards and as deacons and trustees and
[1:27:54] helped. They were a good
[1:27:57] help. But when the time
[1:27:59] came that they got a little criticism or
[1:28:02] a little bit of a little bit of got in a
[1:28:05] little bit of trouble, I'm preaching to
[1:28:07] our home folks
[1:28:08] tonight, preaching to us and to me. You
[1:28:12] go through a little bit of holocritics,
[1:28:13] you know, and they say, "Why do I have
[1:28:16] to put up with that? What's the point?
[1:28:19] Let me go
[1:28:20] back." Somebody got on the internet,
[1:28:22] maybe a family member or something, get
[1:28:24] on the internet and start looking up
[1:28:25] things about Brother Brandham and things
[1:28:27] that they don't vet that. They don't
[1:28:29] know those people what who put that on
[1:28:31] there. They don't know whether it's true
[1:28:33] or not, but they believe it. Huh? They
[1:28:36] accept it and it they say, "Well, if
[1:28:38] there's going to be this kind of
[1:28:39] criticism, I didn't know it was going to
[1:28:40] be like this." So, they walk away.
[1:28:45] And I I'm just imploring you, church,
[1:28:48] don't don't do that. Go on in.
[1:28:52] See, when you're standing there on the
[1:28:53] borderline, you can see Moses when he
[1:28:54] died, he could see across, but the ang
[1:28:56] the Lord wouldn't let him go on in.
[1:28:59] But Joshua went all the way in. Amen.
[1:29:02] Oh, we're and we're not just a coming
[1:29:04] out message for a going in message. Let
[1:29:07] me go all the way into the rapture. Let
[1:29:08] me go all the way in to the message. I'm
[1:29:10] I'm not going to give up on it. I'm
[1:29:12] going to double down on it. I'm not
[1:29:14] going to give up on the word. I'm going
[1:29:15] to I'm going to get more into the word.
[1:29:18] If there's something I don't understand.
[1:29:20] I know there's there's many things I
[1:29:21] don't understand, but Lord, let me not
[1:29:23] lean on my own understanding, but let me
[1:29:25] lean on the word of God. Let me lean on
[1:29:27] his presence. Yeah.
[1:29:30] Hallelujah.
[1:29:32] What did they do? They settled for
[1:29:33] religion. They said, "Well, I could be
[1:29:36] religious in the Baptist church." And
[1:29:37] that's true. Yeah. You could be religion
[1:29:41] religious in the Baptist church. Yeah.
[1:29:44] And you could have something maybe that
[1:29:45] satisfied some part of you and said,
[1:29:47] "Well, I've done my duty, but I'm not
[1:29:50] happy with a part of the word. I want to
[1:29:52] go all the way into the fullness of the
[1:29:54] word. Let me go all the way into peace.
[1:29:56] Let me go all the way into joy. Let me
[1:29:58] go all the way into loving my brother.
[1:30:00] Let me go all the way into all the
[1:30:01] promises of God. I want to be in that
[1:30:03] land that the prophet saw and said,
[1:30:05] "There's where all the promises lay."
[1:30:08] Yes. Inside the land. They settled for
[1:30:11] religion instead of the true baptism of
[1:30:13] the Holy Ghost. Settle for formal church
[1:30:14] services instead of true worship. Settle
[1:30:16] for dogma built on personal testimony
[1:30:18] and superstition instead of the full
[1:30:20] word of God. settle for a good name in
[1:30:23] the community or the illusion of success
[1:30:25] like the rich young ruler without
[1:30:27] surrendering all to Christ. But why
[1:30:29] settle, church musicians, come on up.
[1:30:32] Why settle for the other side of the
[1:30:33] river? Why settle on a Wednesday night?
[1:30:35] You say, "Well, it's just a Wednesday
[1:30:36] night service, but let me receive all
[1:30:38] that God has for me tonight. If you need
[1:30:40] healing, he's here just as much as he is
[1:30:42] on a Sunday. If you need salvation, he's
[1:30:45] here just as much as he is on a Sunday.
[1:30:47] If you need the baptism of the Holy
[1:30:49] Ghost, don't settle with just
[1:30:50] sanctification and a life that's been
[1:30:52] cleaned up. Go on in, church. Let's go
[1:30:55] on in. How many can say amen to that
[1:30:56] tonight. I'm not a Gadite. That's not
[1:30:59] what I'm called to be. And I warned you
[1:31:01] when we read these about these 12
[1:31:02] tribes. Some of them never did make
[1:31:04] anything out of their lives. And yet,
[1:31:06] they were the 12 tribes of Israel, the
[1:31:08] foundation of the city. And in the end,
[1:31:11] in the millennium, everything was set
[1:31:14] back in order. and the Gades, whether
[1:31:16] they wanted to be or not, we're back on
[1:31:18] the other side of the river. But brother
[1:31:20] Brandham taught us that the Gentiles
[1:31:22] wasn't like that. We've got to come to
[1:31:24] the fullness of the word here. This is
[1:31:26] our
[1:31:28] opportunity. Amen. In the end, they
[1:31:31] overcome and are placed properly, but
[1:31:33] our overcoming is
[1:31:35] here. They have their portion, but their
[1:31:38] land become a hog lot and they rejected
[1:31:40] Christ.
[1:31:42] Lot was
[1:31:43] saved, but his wife become a pillar of
[1:31:47] salt and his family become the Moabites
[1:31:49] who were completely
[1:31:52] destroyed. We want the perfect will of
[1:31:55] God, don't we? Say, God, give that to
[1:31:57] me. Let's bow our heads
[1:32:00] together. I could go on, but I think you
[1:32:02] get the
[1:32:05] point. Preaching to each one of us to
[1:32:08] myself. I don't want to settle. I don't
[1:32:11] want to settle for just an experience.
[1:32:14] Let me have the fullness of the
[1:32:16] word. I don't want to settle for just a
[1:32:20] little bit of peace, a little temporary
[1:32:23] happiness, something I can give
[1:32:26] myself. But I want you, Lord. I want
[1:32:30] your
[1:32:31] fullness. Could you make that your
[1:32:33] prayer tonight? And I just make it mine
[1:32:35] as well. I want everything he has for
[1:32:37] me. I want the full revelation of the
[1:32:38] word. I don't want a part of it. I want
[1:32:41] all of it. And I know when it's a
[1:32:43] revelation, a real revelation, it won't
[1:32:45] contradict anything in the Bible. Won't
[1:32:47] contradict anything in the message. Let
[1:32:49] me have it, Lord. I want all of it for
[1:32:51] my family, for my children. I want this
[1:32:54] inheritance, Lord. If if I go by way of
[1:32:56] the grave, maybe the next generation
[1:32:58] will will go on into the rapture. But
[1:33:00] let me take all that's been allotted to
[1:33:02] me. Oh, God. Heavenly Father, Lord, as
[1:33:06] we as we call out to you tonight, Lord,
[1:33:09] we want to go on in. We want to go on in
[1:33:12] where all the promises lay, I pray, God,
[1:33:14] that you help us, you know, we can't do
[1:33:17] that by effort, Lord, but we must do it
[1:33:19] by the power of the Holy Ghost. I pray,
[1:33:21] Lord, that you'd just move in a mighty
[1:33:23] way. I pray that the the sick would be
[1:33:26] healed, Lord, because in the fullness of
[1:33:28] the word, you said, "I am the God that
[1:33:30] heals all thy diseases." Lord, I pray
[1:33:33] that the the backsider would be restored
[1:33:36] because in the fullness of the word, you
[1:33:37] said, "I know the thoughts that I think
[1:33:39] toward you, thoughts of peace and not of
[1:33:41] evil, to give you an expected end."
[1:33:43] Lord, we believe that word. I pray, God,
[1:33:45] that it would be true in our lives that
[1:33:48] it would come to pass. It would
[1:33:49] manifest. You said, "Train up a child in
[1:33:51] the way that they should go. And when
[1:33:53] they're old, they won't depart from it."
[1:33:54] Lord, I've seen you do it for others.
[1:33:56] Lord, do it for me. I want to go all the
[1:33:59] way into the fullness of my promise. I
[1:34:01] pray you grant it, Lord. I pray you'd
[1:34:04] heal the sick and touch those that are
[1:34:05] in need. We thank you for it, Lord.
[1:34:07] Thank you for your word in Jesus name.
[1:34:11] Amen. Thank you,
[1:34:14] Jesus. Oh, why don't we just worship him
[1:34:16] a minute? If you need prayer, altar's
[1:34:18] open tonight. I believe the presence of
[1:34:20] the Lord is here.
[1:34:24] Hallelujah. Oh, to be lost in his
[1:34:28] presence. Oh, thank you, Lord.
[1:34:31] found in his likeness. Oh, I want to
[1:34:35] hear him say, "Well, well done." Oh,
[1:34:38] granny, Lord. Oh, I want to hear you
[1:34:41] say, "Well done."
[1:34:43] Oh, I just want to
[1:34:47] please the Lord. Oh, make it your prayer
[1:34:50] now.
[1:34:52] Oh, be his will in every way.
[1:35:00] Oh, to be lost in your presence.
[1:35:05] Hallelujah. Found in your
[1:35:09] likeness to hear you say,
[1:35:13] "Well, someday." Just raise your hands
[1:35:15] to him and make it personal now. Oh, I
[1:35:19] just want to
[1:35:21] please the
[1:35:24] Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:35:26] Oh, be his will in every way. To be lost
[1:35:32] in your presence, Lord. To be lost in
[1:35:36] your
[1:35:39] presence. Found in this life. I can
[1:35:44] sense
[1:35:45] [Music]
[1:35:48] well. Sing it again with all your heart.
[1:35:51] Oh, I just want to be as we stand
[1:35:55] together. Lift your hand and worship him
[1:35:57] for a moment. Believe he loves our
[1:36:00] worship. Oh, his will in every
[1:36:06] way. I want to be long in his presence.
[1:36:12] Want to be found in his
[1:36:15] likeness. Want to hear him say,
[1:36:19] [Music]
[1:36:21] "Welcome." Do you love him tonight? How
[1:36:25] do you love him? Love him with all your
[1:36:27] heart. I just want to give you
[1:36:30] everything. All that I am, all that I
[1:36:33] have, all that I'll ever be. I want to
[1:36:36] please you,
[1:36:37] Lord. I don't want to stop short.
[1:36:40] Remember when uh when the the prophet, I
[1:36:42] believe it was Elisha, the king come to
[1:36:45] him and he told him, he said he the
[1:36:49] prophet was dying and he told him, he
[1:36:51] said, "Take this this bow and these
[1:36:53] arrows." He said, "Strike the arrows on
[1:36:55] the
[1:36:55] ground." And when when he did, he he
[1:36:59] struck the arrow. When he found the
[1:37:00] arrow, he struck it. Remember, he struck
[1:37:02] it once, twice, three times. And he come
[1:37:05] back. And the prophet said, "I told you
[1:37:08] to strike. I didn't tell you to
[1:37:12] stop." Brother Brandon preached a sermon
[1:37:14] called God's Arrow of Deliverance. Shot
[1:37:16] from a bow. He shot the arrow out the
[1:37:19] window and he told him to strike. He
[1:37:21] said you should have struck until all
[1:37:22] your enemies were defeated. Let me tell
[1:37:24] you church, there is a bride here at the
[1:37:26] end time that will strike until all the
[1:37:29] enemies will be defeated. And the Bible
[1:37:31] says the last enemy is death. I believe
[1:37:33] that we're we are that bride. The word's
[1:37:36] already there. What we have need of to
[1:37:38] do it is already there. Let's go on in.
[1:37:41] Let's accept it in his fullness. Let's
[1:37:43] believe it. Let's be happy about it.
[1:37:45] Amen. Do you love him? Hallelujah. his
[1:37:47] will in every way. Oh yeah. Oh to be
[1:37:54] lost in his presence. Sing the Lord.
[1:37:58] Found in his
[1:38:01] likeness
[1:38:02] here. Well done. Thank you Lord.
[1:38:07] Say oh yes. I just want to
[1:38:13] please the
[1:38:15] [Music]
[1:38:18] Lord. Be his will in every
[1:38:24] way. Oh to be lost in his
[1:38:29] [Music]
[1:38:30] presence, found in his
[1:38:34] likeness. To hear him say, "Well done.
[1:38:38] [Music]
[1:38:43] And all I want to do is love
[1:38:48] him. I'm so glad I feel his love for
[1:38:54] [Music]
[1:38:55] me. And Jesus paid the price of
[1:39:02] redemption on the cross of Calary.
[1:39:08] Oh, so every day my heart will praise
[1:39:13] him. Oh, I know I'll ever be the
[1:39:21] same. And all I want to do is love him.
[1:39:27] Love his
[1:39:30] holy with all your hearts. Now we're
[1:39:34] singing. All I want to do is love
[1:39:39] him. I'm so glad I feel his love for
[1:39:46] me. And Jesus paid the price of
[1:39:52] redemption on the cross of Calary.
[1:39:58] Oh, so every day my heart will praise
[1:40:04] him. Oh, I know I'll never be the
[1:40:11] same. And all I want to do is love him.
[1:40:17] Love his
[1:40:21] holy name.
[1:40:26] Oh, can't you
[1:40:29] see
[1:40:31] why I'm so
[1:40:34] happy? Oh, cuz I've
[1:40:39] accepted the
[1:40:41] word of the
[1:40:43] [Music]
[1:40:45] Lord. Oh, the revealed.
[1:40:51] word that was
[1:40:55] spoken by the
[1:40:59] prophet of
[1:41:02] Malachi. Oh, that ought to make us
[1:41:04] happier here tonight. Oh, can't you
[1:41:09] see
[1:41:11] why I'm so happy?
[1:41:16] Oh, cuz I've
[1:41:19] accepted the
[1:41:21] word of the
[1:41:25] Lord. Oh, the
[1:41:29] reveal
[1:41:31] word that was
[1:41:36] spoken by the
[1:41:39] prophet of
[1:41:42] Malachi. 4.
[1:41:45] Can you give the Lord a hand clap of
[1:41:47] praise
[1:41:48] tonight? Amen. Did you enjoy the word of
[1:41:51] the Lord tonight? I believe it'll do you
[1:41:54] good. Amen. Don't forget on Sunday, just
[1:41:56] one service at 10:30. Amen. Just come

[1:42:00] presence of the Lord. Amen. It's always
[1:42:02] good to be together in the presence of
[1:42:04] the Lord, isn't it? Amen. You're
[1:42:05] worshiping good tonight. I wonder if we
[1:42:06] could just speed it up a little. Key of
[1:42:08] G. We shall be
[1:42:10] changed. Oh, we shall be changed.
[1:42:16] I know that we shall be

[1:44:24] been changed. Well, I've been to the
[1:44:27] water and I've been baptized. I've been
[1:44:31] washed in the blood of the lamb.
[1:44:36] Well, I've been changed from this
[1:44:38] creature that I once was and redeemed.
[1:44:43] Is now my
[1:44:45] day? Well, I've been

[1:46:11] changed and I've been
[1:46:14] reborn. Oh, my life has been
[1:46:19] reed. Oh, what a difference it makes
[1:46:23] when the Lord has a way. All my life,
[1:46:27] praise God, has been changed. Well, I've
[1:46:31] been
[1:46:32] changed and I've been reborn. Amen.
[1:46:36] You're free to go in the name of the
[1:46:37] Lord. God bless
[1:46:39] you. Oh, what
[1:46:47] a praise God.
