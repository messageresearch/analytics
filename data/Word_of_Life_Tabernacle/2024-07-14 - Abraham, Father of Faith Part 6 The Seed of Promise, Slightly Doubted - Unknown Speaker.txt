this morning I I pray you just move as only you can Lord and we'll give you the praise and the glory and the honor in Jesus name amen amen hallelujah you love the Lord this morning we're going to be reading in the Book of Genesis again uh we um actually we're going to go first to uh Genesis uh chapter 4 or Galatians chapter 4 I'm sorry Galatians chap 4 verse 28 and then we'll go back to uh Genesis 12 later Galatians 4:28 I want to say uh thank you for being here this morning to have our visitors with us we're looking forward to the meetings coming up and so the meetings start on SE at 7 o'clock on Thursday so and then Friday night at 7 as well 10:30 and 6 on Saturday and 10:30 on Sunday now we may start that service a little late depending on how tired uh everybody is on Sunday but we'll just have one service on Sunday we will not have service this Wednesday night so service will start on Thursday night and uh we got a a good number of people coming in I anticipate at least as many as we had last year and so we're uh looking forward to all of our visitors a lot of people coming from out of town different states to come in and uh so we want to make them welcome and I want to thank you in advance for the hard work that you'll do in the meetings and I believe there's a reward in that and I just believe for a great move of the Holy Spirit and Revival would break Out Among Us I'm so thankful for what he has been doing Among Us I uh the service Wednesday night I just thought was was good tonight brother Joel's going to speak to us we're going to have uh our youth Focus tonight as we usually do and uh this morning after the service if the deacons could meet with me immediately after the service uh we've been trying to work on security and things we live in a crazy world and uh some terrible things happening in the world world and uh we've done everything we can do to help make the church secure in that way there's only so much you can do uh but we want you to know that we're doing everything we can do and trusting the Lord to help keep us safe as we have people here and and church is a soft target uh I think anybody with any Authority today uh the devil's out to get them people are out to get them but we got to stand on the word don't we we we want to stand on the word and and stay with the with the Bible and say the things that need to be said and God help us to do that Genesis or Galatians rather chapter 4 I've been in Genesis so much I can't I can't get out of it this morning Galatians chapter 4: 28 now we Brethren as Isaac was are the children of Promise how many believe you're the children of promise this morning but as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the spirit even so it is now nevertheless what saith the scripture cast out the Bond woman and her son the son of the Bond woman shall not be Heir with the son of the free woman so then brethren we are not children of the Bond woman but of the free pray the Lord would add his Blessing to the word you may be seated I want to speak to you this morning on the seed of a slightly doubted promise one of the reasons that we see Abraham making mistakes uh the way that he did in his life and and brother brandham taught us we read the quotes where brother brandham said that Abraham was a was a man full of mistakes and I think we all could say we're full of mistakes and yet by the grace of God we're here this morning but God didn't count his mistakes to him because of his faith but many of the mistakes that he made was because his Revelation that he had was Progressive so he didn't know at first exactly ly how God would move and what God would do in his life and I think that's true of all of us many times it's a lack of Revelation in our lives is why we make some of the mistakes that we do but as God unfolds himself to us we have to be willing to accept the furtherance of the revelation of God in our lives and and and at some point in our lives we've got to he must be revealed to us in such a way that we begin to walk as mature Christians and we see Abraham reaching that point where he had to reach a place where a where God could look at Abraham and say I know how he'll lead his family I know what he'll do so I'll reveal myself to him in a way that I can't reveal myself to anyone else on the earth because I know Abraham will keep my word and I want to be a a person like that today I want to be a Son of God like that that though I'm called by faith and by election but I want to be somebody that keeps the word of God somebody who believes the promise of God and yet if we've made mistakes we don't just quit believing we don't we don't give up we don't well the thing to do is put another foot forward and I've seen people well I made a mistake I should quit Church no Now's the Time to go to church now's the time you need to be in the presence of God now's the time you need to accept what God's done for you let it be a lesson in your life let Revelation come to you let it be unfolded in a further way in your life and if you go if you study the message you'll find brother Bram uses that word unfolded when he talks about the nature of God and how he reveals himself to us he doesn't reveal himself all at once but he unfolds himself he even said that the revealing of the son of man was the unfolding of the son of man he's he's slowly revealing himself to us and as he reveals himself we come closer and we come closer and closer to him now Abraham made these mistakes because his Revelation wasn't what it should have been now look first he's told that he'll be a great nation go in your scriptures to Genesis chapter 12 if you have your Bible with with you this morning and I'll show you we we'll go over some of the things we've went over but then we're going to move on but I want to see I want you to see what God promised him what God showed him and what God didn't show him yeah Genesis 12:1 now the Lord said to Abram get out of thy country and from thy Kindred from thy Father's House unto a land that I will show you so the promise at this time is of a land that he's not shown yet but he knows it's there yeah he said 'I will make of thee a great nation I Will Bless thee make thy name Great Thou shalt be a blessing I will bless them that bless thee curse him that curseth thee and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed he tells him what he's going to do but he doesn't tell him how he's going to do it right so go to Genesis 13 Genesis 13:14 so next he is shown the land in Genesis 13 the Lord said to Abram after that lot was separated from him lift up now now thine eyes so now he's fully obeyed God you remember he comes out he's fully obeyed God he's separated from unbelief he's walking in the land and now after lot is separated from him lift up your eyes and look from the place where thou art northward and Southward and Eastward and Westward for all the land which thou seest to thee will I give it and to thy seed forever I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth so that if a man can number the dust of the earth then shall thy seed also be numbered this is new information that he didn't give him before he had a promise he would make him great but he didn't know how he would make him great but now there's more information there's more Revelation that he's getting in his experience with God now he said I'll make your seed as the dust of the earth arise he said walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it for I will give it unto thee so there was a time when the land was just a concept to Abraham there was a time when it seemed like that as we would say today living a Christian Life was just something that he could hope for something he wanted to do something that was a desire to him but now he could walk it he could he could go down the land and he could walk around it and see what it was and there Comes A Time In Our Lives when we are mature enough we begin to walk through the land that he's given us it's no longer just a promise but it's becoming a reality that we have what God promised us right but yet the it still wasn't complete the unfolding wasn't complete of what he wanted to do so he said I'm going to walk you you need to walk through the land and he said I've given it to you next in Genesis 15 Genesis 15:4 he shown that his air would come from him now this is important because it it means it's not going to be a proxy or in other words a uh it's not going to be his uh his Heir that he just gives his property to it's not going to be a elzer is trusted servant but his Heir would come from him Genesis 154 behold the word of the Lord came unto him saying this shall not be thine Heir the words elzer is trusted servant but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine Heir and he brought him forth AB Broad and said look now toward Heaven tell the Stars if thou be able to number them he said unto him so shall thy seed be so it's a further Revelation he's showing him oh Abraham Abraham this is going to be your seed all right your children yeah amen Wonder but now there's still something missing at this time from the story yeah and what's missing what is missing is Sarah's part in the Revelation Abraham's part has become clear but God has never spoken to Sarah yeah right now think about it he always spoke to Abraham and Sarah followed What Abraham said but God never spoke directly to Sarah until he revealed the secrets of her heart there in the tent yeah right before that she had never seen or heard the supernatural voice of God so she had to her part had to be revealed now we know Sarah had to have a body change right but she had not heard directly from God and she had to hear she had to see the sign of the son of man she had to see God revealed in flesh or she could not believe because we know Sarah had faith it wasn't just Abraham that had Faith but the Bible tells us in Hebrews 1111 through faith also Sarah herself look look at the language Paul uses he said not just Abraham not just cuz she's his wife although that's why she didn't die when she left but that's not the only thing but Sarah herself received strength oh I'm so happy that the bride is not just a bystander she's not just somebody this is the devil wants to attack you personally because he wants to say you're just going to be a bystander you don't really have a part you don't really have a a place to a role to play in the message of the hour the message is for preachers or the message is for uh for old people the message for somebody else but the message is for you this morning the promise is for every one of us can we believe that this morning it's for every one of us to grab a hold of and Satan attacks that Revelation yes but Sarah through faith Sarah herself received strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child oh my when she was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised she judged him faithful it wasn't enough just for Abraham to judge him faithful right are you with me now she had to judge him faithful now we know that in this hour that whatever false Doctrine is taught and this is just my observation but believe that it's true it's taught in the absence of the opening of the word right because it's the opening of the word the the open book that teaches us the bride's part in the Revelation are you with me so far this morning right you have a part and Satan wants to attack your part what did the message come to do the message did not come to make us better at argument right right the message didn't come to make us more knowledgeable all right right why did the message come it comes so we ourselves yeah could receive strength yeah to conceive are you with me now we had to the bride had to receive strength to become the word in the hour that we live in this is the age when the bride would produce or become the manifestation of the fullness of the word so there was a partial unveiling where God spoke to Luther a certain thing and there was a partial unveiling where God spoke to Wesley a certain thing but then there had to come a fullness of the unveiling when God spoke in this age and what did he tell us it wasn't just for a prophet if it was just for a prophet how could oh my how could Sarah receive strength but he gave it to a prophet to give it to us so that we could receive strength to do what needed to be done in this hour so we could receive strength to be a Mark 16 church are you with me now so we could receive strength to do the Greater Works so we can receive strength to live in leoda and not be overcome by it so we could receive strength to overcome the anxiety that's in the land today so we can receive strength to overcome every bit of the depression and the and the nonsense that's out there in the world we had to overcome something so God said I'm going to send a fullness of the word so Sarah Rec recognizes her part yeah in the promise oh that's good yeah are you with me now that's why Satan hates the opening of the word right and whenever you see false Doctrine being taught usually it's not so much what they're teaching but what they're not teaching right because what what they're teaching may be an error but what they're not teaching is important because when you're not teaching the opening of the book and that the and that the message is complete and we have what we need then you're leaving out the bride's part you're waiting on a prophet to come and redo what happened on the plane of mamory right but we're not waiting on that we're on the other side what are we waiting on a body change are you with me now so it's the open book through that son of man Ministry that reveals the bride's part in Redemption without it the seed of Promise can be slightly doubted and denominations will form right right right and this is very important church I know it's teaching but it's really important you just hang with me for a minute if we could understand that thing it would really help us you know brother brandham talks about it this way he said remember that was not Jesus talking to Abraham there that could discern the thoughts and Sarah's mind behind him that was not Jesus he had not yet been born but was a man in human flesh that Abraham called Elohim the great Almighty showing Jesus said as it was in the days of Sodom watch closely in the days of Sodom so will it be at the coming of the son of man when the son of man is being revealed not no more as a church not no more the bride is called all right right so when brother brandom comes down to about the last three years of his ministry he begins to separate the bride and the church right he begins to show us the difference between the wise and the foolish between the bride in the church between those who go in a Rapture and those who remain here are you with me now between Abraham and lot and it begins to show us what the bride part is because there is a part for every one of us to play see I want to challenge you see we just don't want numbers although we want numbers empty pews never inspired anybody we want people to come to church I'd rather you be in church than out of church you're much better off coming to the house of God but but what I really would like to see is people becoming the word and I believe we're seeing that I I I don't give up on yourself Abraham was becoming the he made a lot of mistakes but he was still in the program of God all right and if you beat yourself up too much what you end up doing is you end up putting yourself out because you see the part the bride's part but you say it can't be me because if Satan can't keep you from believing in the opening of the word he'll try to get you to believe it's not for you and that it doesn't matter to you but I'll say we need to take every bit of this message we need to take what a prophet said and we need to begin to apply it in our lives why because this is the hour when we've got to become the word yes right we're going to be living examples living Bibles walking through the Earth that we live in now he said not no more as a church but the bride is called yeah in that day the son of man will be revealed what to join the church to the Head unite the marriage of the Bride the bridegroom call will come right through this when the son of man will come down and come in human flesh to unite the two together the church has to be the word how many believe that today he is the word and the two unites together and to do that it'll take the manifestation of the revealing of the son of man yes oh my not a clergyman he said I don't know did you see what I mean see it son of man Jesus Christ will come down in human flesh Among Us will make his word so real that it'll unite now we recognize he did that in a prophet right in a prophet's body but he didn't stop revealing himself Oh my he didn't stop the son of man Ministry was not just a prophet standing there revealing the secrets of the heart are you with me now but the son of man is revealed in the bride sir because the son of man is the word so he'll make his words so real that it'll unite the church and him as one the bride and then she'll go home to the wedding supper she's already United he said see we go to the wedding supper not to the marriage he said the marriage of the Lamb has come but the Rapture is going to the wedding supper when the word here unites with the person they two become one and then what does it do then it manifests what the son of man again when oh church when the word and the person become one it manifests the son of man again not the church theologians the son of man the word and and what the church yes becomes one oh my oh we could we can preach on that all day the word and the church right becomes one and what does that make you the bride Hallelujah flesh of his flesh bone of his bone power of his power are you with me now yes the word and the church becomes one whatever the son of man done he was the word the church does the same thing right oh Hallelujah so it is the opening of the word the revealing of the son of man that opens up the bride's part and separates the bride from the church turn with me to Revelation 61 we'll read that one verse but you young people you need to understand this and all of us do we need to understand this what what was the opening of the seals look at Revelation 61 he said I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and I heard as were the noise of Thunder one of the four Beast saying come and see now so you mark that and and now listen close he said notice the first seal open the first seal when it was open in the symbol form it thundered now what about when it's open in its reality form all right oh my people are waiting on the Thunders come on but it's already it's already happened he said the Thunders uh were the Revelation contained in the seals and watch but there was a symbol form and a reality form he said my it thundered as soon as the the lamb struck back the seal and what did it reveal not all of itself all right oh my so just like what happened with Abraham he didn't immediately reveal all of himself right there was a point where Abraham but he was it was revealed to Abraham as Abraham needed it hallelujah oh I believe he'll do the same thing for you he didn't always know God was Jehovah Gyra he didn't always know God was elai he didn't always know those things but there come a time it was revealed to him I believe we ought to trust God in our own lives you may not know what you want to know now you may not be able to see the rhyme or the reason for why things happen but as you need it he'll reveal himself to you yes sir through the opening of the word in this hour and I believe that we're living in a time when there's nothing held back yeah all right Hallelujah now look he said he said it thundered he said first it's with go it's with God next it's an ass symbol then it's revealed so watch the steps first it's with God Only God knows it right next it's in a symbol John sees it right right we have it written in the word then it's revealed three things he said see it's coming forth from the throne right first it can't be seen heard or nothing it's sealed up see there are people who still believe that that's the condition we're in M right that the Thunders have not come forth the the word has not been opened but and I'll say again I just I'm not hammering those people if a person believes that you just haven't come if you sit there today and say I don't have a clue what he's talking about well you will one day just store it in your memory in I believe God will lead you to that and it's not because I know more than you do it's just I I I've been benefited by sitting under a prophet's message and many of us can say Amen to that we benefit from sitting under a prophet's message and we know where we're at amen so first it can't be seen or heard or nothing it sealed up the Lamb's blood paid the price yeah it thundered when he spoke it out when he did a white horse rider started out and it still was a symbol he said now watch he said it would be known in the last day but it comes forth watch in a church symbol right a church symbol he said do you understand it church and the congregation says amen it comes forth in a symbol of a church that they know there is a seal so so the way it comes to the church is as wow I want to get real excited about this and You' think I was crazy but it comes to the church as a symbol yeah are you with me now it's a white horse riding a man riding on a white horse they don't know what it is they just have to guess at it it comes to the church as a symbol Oh my he said and they know that there is a seal but just what it is yet they don't know because it's a white horse rider and only is to be revealed at the last day when this actual seal is broken broken to who not to Christ but to the church yeah he said notice now oh my that just makes me tremble he said I hope that the church and I watch how he keeps calling the church the church it was a symol to the church he said I hope that the church truly understands it what I mean you people he said I'm going to call you bride yes sir that you'll understand it what's God doing he's showing Abraham her Sarah's part in the promise are you with me now he's showing to Sarah her part in the promise yeah and people just miss it yes but it's there yeah and what that means is that that now I can receive strength where before I could not produce the right thing yeah I could only by effort produce a wild man I could only by effort produce a denomination listen I can put the same before the opening of the word I can put the same effort in I do now and it would produce a denominational system right it would produce another organization but brother JT once the seals have been open and the Bible becomes a new book what happens now by the effort we put forth when you raise your hands in church when you come to the house of God when you preach when you sing what whatever it is that you do when you put forth that effort you're not working towards the denominational system what are you working for you're working towards the revelation of Who You Are God has shown you you're not church anymore you're the bride Oh Glory to God I'm going to call you bride so you'll understand it yes Hallelujah good now before the seals that's a good background for what we want to say and I'm halfway my time's halfway over God help us today before the seals Joel will be real short tonight so we don't have to worry about that before the seals were open to Abraham Sarah a type of the church before the bride part was revealed came up with an idea right now she didn't know her part so we want to blame Sarah and but she didn't realize Abraham knew his part she didn't know hers Genesis 16 And1 now Sarah Abram's wife bear him no children she had a handmaid an Egyptian whose name was Hagar now during this time the word of God had been trying Sarah right the Bible tells us the word his word Joseph's word tried him right because it was the very promise that made his life difficult right right I'm just going to tell you this morning that's what gets you that's why you go through difficulties many times and when you're not a Christian you can just kind of do whatever you want to do but when you become a Christian Satan trains his guns right on you right because you're you're doing something so Satan's trying to destroy you as a Christian why but what's he trying to do he's trying to he's trying to make you doubt the promise and so the any delay of the promise without the proper Revelation yeah are you with me now now a delay of the promise without an open book with oh god without the message of the hour without something that tells us who we are yeah a delay of the promise will cause us to begin to fidget spiritually and we begin to look for an exit we begin to look for a way out we begin to look for something else to come we begin to look for another Prophet or another messenger or something else because there's been a delay in what in how we perceive and so there's a pressure on those who who must fulfill their part but they don't realize what that part really is because and so she's waiting there there's this pressure and she said well maybe if I just left the picture maybe I'm the problem all right all right now come on Church you know you think like that sometimes well the message is okay I believe a prophet came maybe I'm the problem come maybe I can't make it maybe I'm no good right come on we're human beings we think like that don't we the devil come to you and tell you you you don't have a part in it what you need is a revelation of this message that no matter how many mistakes I make no matter what happens in my life no matter what comes or what goes I know that God is has his hand on my life I know I'm his bride I know I love him I know I love his voice I know I love to go to the house of God I may be going through hell and back but I know that God is still with me I know he's the same yesterday today and forever he never leaves me he never forsakes me oh church we ought to grab a hold of that promise today he never leaves me he never gives up on me he never oh though I might struggle he never gives up on me hallelujah it's this message that teaches us that Hallelujah you were called you were elected you were a seed of God you see why that's important cuz the devil's trying to get you to form another denomination yeah oh my and Sarah said to Abraham behold now the Lord hath restrained me from bearing oh it might work in somebody else but not for me I pray that go in unto my maid maybe that I may obtain children by her and Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarah and Sarah Abram's wife took took Hagar her maid the Egyptian after Abram had dwelt 10 years in the land of Canaan and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife oh my what a terrible mistake out of this Union comes ishmail and ishma was a wild man and still is to this day amen this was the beginning oh Church yeah now look brother brandom looks at this in a unique way he he re recognizes that what they did was wrong and was out of the will of God it was the permissive will of God not the perfect will of God and God would not allow ishmail to be Heir with Isaac but he also recognizes something in it that I wouldn't see without a prophet he said it's the beginning of the promise a lot of you have been through some things you you've walked down a road you and you realize there's all kinds of trouble and strife and maybe you've done some things you're not proud of and I'm sure we all have but listen he recognizes something in this mistake that was more than just oh my not more than just uh it was more than just a a mistake or or something like that but it was the beginning of the Fulfillment of the promise yeah we'll get to the quote in a minute look he said here we are presented with a picture oh the seed started yeah oh my the seed of Promise started in a slightly doubted doubt of the original promise see how it starts low oh my in doubt in the original promise now listen you're not you may you say well I know brother Ben I haven't always been in the perfect will of God and maybe to be bride you have to have always been the perfect will of God well you won't find that in the scripture oh my no Prophet was ever always in the perfect will of God we can look at the scripture and find that right no no no no member of the bride was ever always in the perfect will of God but God uses the permissive will yeah brother brand teaches us is to glorify his perfect will now we can't even hardly comprehend that but he does it now that doesn't give us an excuse because once we have the revelation we got to walk in it we can't back up on it right so it doesn't doesn't give us an excuse but it does allow us in our lives to not to not say well my life has been useless my life has been worthless everything I went through was just a it was just terrible and then then I got saved and everything was better but everything back there didn't matter no it did matter because God used that somehow he's big up that he used even your mistakes to glorify his will good oh church now look he said it started low God promised Abraham through Sarah to have this child but now watch the first seat of Abraham by the bonds woman came by Sarah doubting that this could happen because she was old and past the age of bearing now that's how the church starts yeah that's how it always starts you start from the bottom yeah you don't start from the top a man trying to climb a ladder tries to get on top first he'll break his neck are you with me now yeah you got to start somewhere yeah say brother Ben I don't know where to start start right now all right start right here do you believe Jesus saved start there you believe that that you ought to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for remission of your sins start there start with acts 238 start there and begin to believe God Amen you not going to be don't beat yourself up because you're not what somebody else is I know sometimes kids will backslide and go out in the world and then their parents maybe are there in church and and they come back to the church and they realize well my parents are pretty good people well I wish I could but I could never be what they are well they always weren't always what they are right I think I can speak for all of us in the most mature members in this church when I say that we were not always what we are and we hope that we won't always be what we are right right we trust that every service we're being changed and we're being remade and we're being built and we're and we're growing and we're becoming something different and we're becoming a better worshipper and we're becoming a better we're becoming more tuned into the service and we're getting more on fire for God and we're receiving baptism after baptism of the Holy Ghost are you with me now everybody's got to go through that so the seed starts with a slightly doubted promise that's how it always starts and here we find the beginning of the promise there it is of god being made manifest through a slightly doubted interrupted program of God see but that's the same way oh church that's the same way that denominations come up and Luther come up Luther did a lot of things we wouldn't allow today said a lot of things we don't believe today but he had one thing the just shall live by faith and the seed of Promise started but it wasn't fully revealed yet what it would be and it become a wild man become a denomination but the sced moved on the life moved on and it come through Wesley and it come through Pentecost every age they slightly doubted the promise but it come to an age when there will be a bride who will not fall who will not doubt the promise at all oh I believe that's us today yeah you believe that you got to believe that that's you yeah at some point you got to well I go to church but do you believe that that's you come on amen amen now ishmail was a Seed of Abraham the seed of Promise slightly doubted but Isaac was the full seed of promise right Paul says that the law was the same thing it was the promise slightly doubted Galatians 4:23 tell me ye that desire to be under the law do you not hear the law oh we could stop and preach there for a little while right now you may start there you may start with I just want to get over this and I just want to stop doing this and it may start legally but that's not where God wants to take you now look if you desire to be under the law do you not hear the law in other words if you're going to impose the law on others you better be ready to fulfill all the law yourself right and a person that's guilty of one is guilty of the whole right so that's why we don't come under the law right all we can do is surrender young people are you hearing me if you want to be closer to God all you can do is surrender to him just give into him just find you an altar find a place where you can pray you you people if you've been in a place that's bad and you've made a lot of mistakes find a place where you can pray surrender yourself to God it's not about God wants to give you the Holy Ghost he wants to fill your life he wants to help you but you just got to let go of yourself you got to let go of that doubt you got to separate from it but you can't you sit there say well once I live the law then I'll be a Christian nobody lives the law right we live Grace but the reason we live like we do we don't believe in living like a bunch of a bunch of heathens but the reason we live the way we do is because the seed of promise it's the seed of Promise Isa oh my Isaac was the seed of promise and we are the seed of promise not the seed of a slightly doubted promise but the seed of promise we are not under the law but under grace and grace is what produces the right Works in our lives listen to me if you hold your spouse to a standard of the law they'll never measure up boy got quiet what are we doing dur ourselves if you hold your pastor to a standard of the law he'll never measure up yet Jesus came to fulfill the law are you with me but he was the only one who ever lived like that right but now his life comes back into us and everything good we do is attributes to that yeah right it attributes to that you cannot live under the law because if you do your expectations of others you begin to make lists right people under the law were great at making lists yeah right and if you keep this keep my list you're in yeah right but the problem is somebody else has a different list yeah with your name on it and when I see brother Jeff do all of these things then I'll know when I see brother Danny do all these things I don't know come on don't you realize we're not called to that we're not called to be under the law we're called to be under grace and and the the key is surrender and that's why what I look for in somebody that comes is not what they're doing I don't look at that what I'm looking for is not what they're doing or what they have done what I'm looking for is their willingness to acknowledge I'm a sinner I need help I want to come under Authority I want to come under headship not the authority of the church or the headship of the church the headship of God I want to come under the power of God I want to see a move in my life if you want that that it's there for you amen good yes sir so Isaac is birthed by the will of God he's not he's not under the law he said it written that Abraham had two sons the one by a bondade the other by a free woman yeah but he who was of the Bond woman was born after the flesh but he of the free woman was by promise Isaac is birthed by the will of God ishma is birthed by Abraham's effort listen the Bible tells us to wait on the Lord it says even the youths how many youths do we have here if you consider yourself young raise your hand praise God I see some white-headed people with their hands up listen listen if if you're a youth today it said even the youth shall be shall faint and be weary the young men shall utterly fall allach oh but look at the next verse but they young or old that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mount up with wings like eagles they shall run in be weary they shall walk and not F why because the power of God moves you to the direction you need to go amen all you got to do be is willing yeah that's right I challenge you today you say I can't live it I can't do it I can't be a believer I can't there's no way I can ever accept the message I challenge you today on now you just surrender yourself and see what God does that's right thank you Lord that's right oh my he said how don't you know that because he did it for me and do it for you but you got to be willing to surrender yourself very good Sarah got in a hurry and produced a wild man Eve did the same thing got in a hurry before Adam get to her in the proper way eve took another route David did the same thing bringing back the ark yeah it was right to bring back the ark it was right to have a meeting it was right to worship yeah but the way he did did it brother BR said there wasn't a place prepared for it yet yeah and he didn't consult a prophet oh my brother BR Ties That to the opening of the word he said in denominational ages there was no place prepared for it but now there is yeah amen so David did that thing now he brought back the ark and he did the same thing that Abra or that Sarah did they that have the spirit of God wait for these things he says And when they see those things they believe those things oh how he's talking about the the signs and and the the cloud and the pillar of fire and he said they that wait on the Lord that that ought to be every one of us to this morning we must wait on the Lord or we'll fall but if we wait on the Lord we wait for those things and when we see those things they believe those things again he said they wait on the Lord waiting and when they do and they see the promise of today being Vindicated it renews their faith in his word because he promised to do it and here he is doing it glory to God oh it does my heart good when I see the word Vindicated this message isn't all just Theory all right come on right but it works it works listen if you believe it works yeah there's some wonderful testimonies some of y'all don't even know about yet but God's working right now God's doing things right now he's moving right now Sister Sandra's been sending me testimony seems like every other day she s me she said I know I've been healed I know I was healed the ringing in my ear I know I was healed my blood sugar is better today than it was yesterday that's the faith of Abraham you believe that hold on to that make a positive confession I know I'm going to make it I know I'm going to I'll just put one foot in front of another I can do this not by my own effort but by the power of God in Me Yeah renews faith in the word because we see it and here he is doing it yeah Hallelujah brother brand said then there's no doubt God speaks his word first speaks and then the spirit that's bringing it does the thing that the word said it would do yeah Hallelujah brother brandom says this again about waiting on the Lord he said move just as far as God let you move and then wait on the lord it's not that you don't make any effort it's not that you don't try to serve God in the best of your capacity but move as far as you can move right good and then wait on the Lord they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength Abraham and Sarah didn't wait most ishs are born out of Good Intentions right brother brandom taught that the church like Israel chose law for grace in other words they tried to protect what they had and they organized it made a law out of it died sometimes we do the same thing we get a legalistic attitude and and and maybe it's because we knew that we were saved from a life of sin we know how bad sin is yeah so we begin to get we want to be extra careful with our children we want to be extra careful with with those in the in the church that go to church with us we got to be careful with that because ultimately it's going to take the strength of the Lord if they're going to make it yeah because if we're not careful see we know you how do you know that you've applied legalistic ideas well it's because you blame other people for failing in other words you blame other people for you failing that's good when you blame someone else for the failures of your own life what is that it shows that you had a legalistic mindset towards the wor because if you had if you if you really understood how God works you'd know God I know you're working in my life I can't see it but I know you're working right and so you begin to get these expectations of others well I'll go to church as long as no one ever offends me well all right you won't last long yeah right yes sir or I'll go to church as long as I don't ever offend nobody you won't last song see and and God still deals with us he loves us but we're just trying to produce something by our own efforts yeah but maybe you're raised in church you just want to keep those standards high and we should keep our standards high but be careful not to wrap the word in your opinion amen right because there is a word that's true and we believe it but we need to be careful not to wrap it in our opinion listen the Bible speaks about the Pharisees said they bind heavy burdens Grievous to be born lay them on men's shoulders but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers see legalism doesn't produce Holiness it produces Hypocrites amen ask me how I know I see preachers I know preachers have left the message and gone back to Pentecost and they've gone back to a Pentecostal idea of Salvation if I can just make enough effort God will see my effort and and and and save me listen I I was raised around that stuff right we come up in the wesland Holiness Church and and but dad found out about the message but that was our still our Doctrine was Wesley and Holiness that's the way I was raised and I'll say this it did not produce Holiness right It produced outward Holiness and inward corruption right produced Hypocrites again I got personal knowledge of that listen brother Bram said Jesus said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God you say well he didn't mean it he was talking to people who were theologians those priests great great great great great grandfathers had to be priests to misconstrue one word of it absolutely a death penalty that had to be stoned for one word to be missed and people are so worried about that oh if I go hear that preacher I might hear something that's wrong if I go hear that preacher at the meeting I he might be a little bit emotional more emotional than me and I've wrapped the word in my opinion so I can't receive from anything that's more emotional than me huh or less emotional than me all right what is the word wrapped in an opinion right and that might be the very person that could help you cuz they're different enough from you to help you out right right but to miscon through one word to these priests they had to be stoned they they knew the message yeah they knew Moses word yeah but listen what they did but they had the wrong interpretation of it therefore when the word itself when God promised to send the Messiah and send it in the very swaddling cloth that he promised it would come in in they had a different swaddling for it to be wrapped in it was wrapped in a pinion oh church I I got to take a few more minutes I've got nine minutes left but I'm going take a few more minutes and get through this just bear with me he said let me say this so it is today that they don't get it it's not in the swaddling of denominationalism or intellectual you'll never be able to please God intellectually that's not how you do it it's in the swaddling of the power and the resur ction and the manifestation of the Risen Christ all right the way God promised it not in the swaddling you know what the swaddling was the cloth they wrapped around the baby Jesus and because you come in the form wrapped in the way that he was God's wrapped gift you've heard brother Brandon preach on it God's WRA gift he come in a way that they did not expect him to come because of their opinions but he come exactly how the word said he would come but it wasn't in the swaddling of people's thoughts listen brother Brandon was dealing with our subject I hav haven't gotten off my subject he said Hagar by one little slight difference through woman not through Abraham now Abraham didn't want to do it but God let him do it same thing he let balam go on yeah right now notice by slightly differing with it she brought forth ishmail on which was a wild man never conquered live by his bow he was a wild man he is yet today I said we need to let God be God are you with me now yeah I'm not going to preach at you again till the meeting so you just hang with me a minute now it's a serious thing when we get brother brand talks about getting in a hurry in our personal lives he said it's a serious thing when we go to choose a wife I use this because I know there's several of our kids starting to get older and they need to start hearing it now amen he said am man for the vows here is until death do we part that's how we should keep it you take that vow before God the only death will separate you he said I think we should a man in his right mind is planning a future he should choose that wife very careful be careful what you're doing and a woman choosing a husband or accepting the choice of a husband should be real careful what she's doing especially said in these days a man should think and pray before he chooses a wife now you say what does that have to do with Abraham and Sarah well they got in a hurry and messed up God's program that's right amen and yet we see the grace in that yeah that he used it to the beginning of the starting of the seed right and many of you have you know if you're saved you're saved God don't see none of it but yet you made those mistakes you got to deal with the scars and you've made those mistakes and I think a person who really understands what that is you'd never want your children to go through the same thing right right and so that's why we we we we we stress to our children we want God's perfect will your marriage will be so much better if you want God's perfect will find somebody who's qual ified and full of the Holy Ghost find somebody and that you know that is before you get too invested in the relationship oh my yeah right and I'm GNA embarrass Gabe because he's back and they've been gone for a while so I haven't been able to embarrass him and Millie but but what was it three years ago that that we had meetings and and so this is their kind of their third anniversary of meeting but I think it was in May the first time but three years ago Gabe was looking for a wife and he had had some different relationships and he told me he said I'm not looking for a girlfriend I'm looking for a wife M's turning so red back there sorry sorry guys I know you can take it and God's working in their lives I thank God for that but he but he did the right thing yes sir what he do he didn't just sit there and stew about it or go out in the world and run away from church and I just go marry somebody in the world and I hope it works sir oh but what did he do he he come to his Pastor he said look I I I need I need some get some things right in my own life I need to I need I need to get down to business with God and I need a wife I said we'll just pray that way and and it wasn't very long at all until Here Comes Millie of course we all got en encourage them to talk to one another CU sometimes you have to do that but you see what happens when God's in it yes sir you'll still go through things you will still suffer and suffering is part of life you may suffer more than others much more than others but you don't you realize God put us together we we we come God's provided way and did what God wanted us to do and when God puts us together what God puts together let no man put us son right and so I guess the moral of that story is go to meetings [Laughter] I can think of worse reasons to go to meetings right look but let's think spiritually now see if we get invested in a relationship with an idea or a Doctrine or a church that isn't right but we see it we it makes us happy we think oh they've got an intellectual twist they got a certain Doctrine or certain something we want to see what kind of child would be born from it all right ishmail was Abraham's seed but he was born of a slightly doubted promise yeah we are not just any Seed of Abraham we are seed of the promise the book is open we don't have to make those mistakes again why we've got an open book yeah now look haar Hagar was an Egyptian and we know she'd probably come from Pharaoh's house when Abraham and Sarah were backslid in Genesis 12:16 he entreated Abram well for for Sarah's sake and he had sheep and oxen and he asses and Men servants and Maid servants and she asses and camels and and so he began to give Abraham stuff and that's probably how he got it in a back sting condition right that's why we need to stay close to God because we end up with a Hagar in our life look at how God deals with Hagar now I want you to see something and you're going to see the grace of God Hagar is told to do what she did wasn't her fault brother random says that and but ishmail was born and is was Abraham's natural seed just as much as Isaac's but he was didn't come in the proper channel right and that's why ishma still survives today the children of ishmail yes when ishmail was conceived Sarah began to be despised by Hagar so there was trouble in the home and if you're thinking about polygamy don't do it because every time we see polygamy in the scripture you see Strife in the home right so what does Hagar do Hagar Hagar runs away and the angel of the Lord appears to her remember the story Sarah treated her she treated Sarah badly she in other words she began to think well I could you know I had a baby you couldn't and so and so she begins to treat Sarah badly so Sarah runs her off now we know and I want you to understand this today God doesn't only speak to message people right he doesn't only deal with people who have a revelation right like we have he deals with whoever will cry out to him right but even the church though it come wrong right but even that God still sends this presence anoints y right the same anointing maybe that we would have right but they don't have they don't have the word that's the difference yeah but they have an anointing because they're still Abraham seed if we say it that way just not the right one now God doesn't only speak to message people in Genesis 169 the angel of the Lord come down to Hagar said un her return to thy mistress and submit thyself under her hand yeah and the angel of the Lord said I will multiply thy seed exceedingly it shall not be numbered for multitude and the angel of the Lord said God spoke more to Hagar during this period than he did to Abraham now that's the truth go look it up yeah right until eventually ishmail is 13 years old yes the next time we it's recorded that Abraham's God speaks with Abraham yeah but he spoke to Hagar he said because the Lord has heard thy Affliction he will be a wild man every man's hand against him he shall dwell in the presence of all his Brethren and she called the name of the Lord that spake unto her thou God seest me yeah do you believe he sees you today he sees you if he can see her he can see you yes now look and and she said for she said I have I also here looked after him that seeth me and she goes back and submits herself to Sarah it says Genesis 16:15 Hagar bear Abram a son Abram called his son's name which Hagar bear ishmail Abram was four scor and6 years old that's 86 when Hagar bear ishmail to Abraham to Abram and when Abram was 90 years old in nine the Lord appeared to Abraham and said unto him I am the almighty God walk before me and be thou perfect now here's a further Revelation what's he trying to show him he said I'm the almighty God I'm El should I look he had not spoke to him for 13 years he had to walk by faith even when God didn't speak all right yeah I'm going to skip down a couple I'm sorry there's some good things about that but let's just go on down yeah Abraham still loved ishmail yeah but a prophet's desire is not thus sayith the Lord yeah the word of the Lord is thus sayith the Lord right and Abraham said unto God all that Ishmael might live before thee and God said Sarah thy wife now here comes the Revelation it's going to come to him and then Sarah is going to have the secret of her Hearts revealed and she'll know that it's true yes what Abraham told her Hallelujah and God said Sarah thy wife this is the first time that Abraham knows this yeah Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed thou sh call his name Isaac and I will establish my Covenant with him for an Everlasting Covenant with his seed after him and as for ishmail I have heard thee behold I have bless him and will make him fruitful multiply him exceedingly 12 princes shall he beg get I will make him a great nation but my Covenant will I establish with Isaac which Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year God has not forsaken the church but this is the bride time are you with me now he is on the outside of the church knocking trying to get in to all to see an age that's kicked him out yeah he's not forsaken them come on but they won't let him in right but we've let him in yeah the book has been open we see we know what our part is to play fast forward to chapter 21 and you find that Isaac has been born he's being weaned and Sarah catches Hagar persecuting and mocking Isaac and Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian which he had born unto Abraham mocking she saw ishmail and Hagar mocking Isaac wherefore she said unto Abraham cast out this Bond woman her son the son of this this Bond woman should not be air with my son even with Isaac the thing was very Grievous in Abraham's sight because of his son and God said to Abraham let it not be Grievous in thy sight because the lad because the Bond woman and all that Sarah has said unto thee hearkened to her voice for and Isaac shall thy seed be called and also of the son of the Bond woman will I make a nation this is powerful because he is thy seed yeah right so important hang with me for just a minute I preach about the same amount of time every Sunday and that's dangerous because if I go over everybody's waiting on lunch Abraham sends Hagar out in the desert that's his own son today he would be guilty of child abandonment he sends a baby or a young man rather at this time 13 years old and he sends he sends uh Hagar out in the wilderness into the desert alone into the desert they would almost certainly die but God said I'll make him a great nation all right I'll take care of him why because he's your seed yeah go to those next scriptures on there because he's your seed and she went she got down to her last drop of water yeah and she had no ability to make it one step further have you ever been been there yeah you get down to your last little bit of water with no ability to take it any further yeah and she went and set her down over against him a good way off as it were a bow shot for she said let me not see the death of the child and she set over against him and lifted up her voice and wept yeah oh church and God heard now it says she wept but God heard the voice of the lad because he said seed right and the angel of God Called to Hagar out of heaven and said unto her what ilth thee Hagar fear not for God ha heard the voice of the lad where he is he was not the promised seed he was not Abraham's Faith seed but he was Abraham's seed and God provided a way through tribulation you could say of him being saved look and God heard the voice of the lad arise lift up the lad hold him in thine hand I will make him a great nation and God opened her eyes she saw a well of water and she went and filled the bottle with water and gave the lad drink why because ishmail was Abraham's seed yes oh I hope you're hear me today listen if he was Abraham's seed just in the natural not even the promised seed how much more when we cry out to God are we be to be able to expect God to meet our needs yes Amen brother brand said I'm closing he said I know where there's another well that was put down on the day of Pentecost he said it's just as open tonight as it was the time when it was open back there when it was open for Hagar and the waters is just as fresh to every man or woman that wants to take the right road with God's word and walk with him you say I'm not sure if I'm Bri you just cry out to God and let God Open up The Well of water he said I'm not sure I can believe I'm not sure I can do it you just open up your cry out to God and let God open up that well am he'll still do it today yes amen he'll still do it do you believe it Church he'll still do it today if he would do it for the seed of a slightly doubted Pro musicians go ahead and come how much more would he give Waters of life to the fully believed seed of Promise how much more to those who really believe the word of God he give his promise now the book has been open we know Sarah's part the son of man has been revealed listen Jes Jesus in the scripture uses the analogy of an unjust judge you remember the story an unjust judge and a widow and he said the Widow was crying out for her inheritance she would have been given like a life estate just a an ability to live on the property she was crying out for that cuz people had taken it away from her and she kept coming back to the judge and the judge was an unjust judge he took bribes and everything else Our God's not like that but Jesus used an extreme example here comes a woman knocks on the door knocks on the door and Jesus said the judge the judge is not just and he doesn't care about her you don't fear God or regard man but because she knocks and and the Bible the King James used the word importunity because of her importunity it means she kept coming back she didn't she didn't quit she didn't give up she didn't walk out she just kept coming back knocking yes when she did God said the judge said okay let her have whatever she wants amen he said if the unjust judge would do that how much more will God do for those of his children who he loves so much amen and he ends that he said will we find faith will he find faith when he returns brother Brandon picks that up and says will Malachi 4 be revealed Revelation 10 1-7 well Luke 1730 I believe there's a bride today we are not a widow we are a bride and we're not coming to an unjust judge we're walking before the one who knows our hearts he knows all about us knock on that door cry out to him in the desert and there will be a well of water would you stand with me this morning oh I I believe that Well's here this morning I don't believe we have to wait on the meetings to have that well of water I believe it's here this morning he's the same yesterday today and forever if he would do that for a widow what about his wife if he would do that for Hagar what about me what about you you get thinking well I'm not good enough Hagar wasn't good enough but there was she was found in the desert and she cried out to God and God heard the voice of the seed even though it wasn't Isaac I say God will hear your voice today give you water from the rock the driest thing in the desert driest place you've ever been in but he'll still fill your life if you let him would you bow your heads with me today my heart hurts many times I don't want to preach legalism yet I have to tell the truth we want to do the right things go the right way my heart hurts for people because many times the only reason why people are making the mistakes they make they just haven't realized who they are in the word that's just never been revealed to them and if you could just ever really get a revelation of that I know who I am nothing can move me from what I am and who I am that's what we want church if you cry out to him today if you cry out to him you've got that Revelation in your heart even a glimpse of it brother so what we have here is a shadow of a shadow of a shadow of a shadow of the love of God what will it be like when we see the full thing the whole thing I believe it will happen one day maybe you've made mistakes in your life but you say right now God I I believe you'll Hear My Cry maybe you maybe you haven't had the right attitude towards the word but today Lord that's going to change right now Lord right now I'm I believe that I'm going to be I'm going to be well my family is going to be healed things are going to be right maybe you've taken God's permissive will but today Lord I want to follow your perfect will I want to go forward I'm going to let those things that are in the past be in the past and let God move in my life would you just do that this morning I don't know your situation but God knows and if you'll cry out to him there's a well that'll open up and you can be saved you can be healed you can have water if you're dry spiritually today there's a well here for you there's a well I believe you can access it right now by the grace of God just talk to him Heavenly Father Lord Jesus I I know this is
