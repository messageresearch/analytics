granted those that are streaming and different ones that are sick and in need I pray God that as the word Goes Forth they would be healed Lord and if they have need of Salvation if there's one Lord that would need you I pray God that they would come to you today Lord and give you their heart we pray in jesus' name amen amen God bless you you can be seated just for a moment thank you for the music this morning I we've had a bunch of different piano players over the last few weeks because of people traveling and things and being out because of sickness and so I'm grateful for all of our musicians that we've been able to have we haven't missed a service of having music and so we thank the Lord for that and and my mom was able to play for us this morning um speaking of Music brother Paul Le Fontaine uh they sent us a letter or a little card in the mail they've issued a new CD him and his family if you get a chance go go listen to that it's online you can get it on Spotify and streaming services like that or order a CD and and it's good message music and we appreciate that and it's always good when there's music we can listen to and U brother Paul does a good job him and his family doing that um if you need a TI receipt for 2020 uh it'll be a couple weeks before we can get them out but there's a signup sheet on the back at the back by brother Mark back there and you can sign up for that and I just don't want to do any more than I have to so if you could if you could sign your name to that and and we'll get you a TI receipt I know a lot of people don't use them anymore but if you could if you need it for your taxes and then um the ballots for the Deacon and trustee election many of you have already done that and turned that in but I wanted to say this that um if you aren't able to be here and you want to vote just let me know and we'll we'll do that um ballots need to be returned by next Sunday morning um um brother Stewart and I if brother Stewart's back he's in Arizona this morning but if they're back in time brother Stewart and I will count those because some most of the other brothers are standing for a position and uh so we'll do that and then um I we'll let you know the results I anticipate that you know all these brothers have served Faithfully over the years and in different capacities and we thank the Lord for that thank the Lord for good leadership here in the church because it it's impossible for a pastor to do it by himself and it would be wrong for me to do everything by myself that it's a body movement of of the bride of Christ so we thank God for that thank you to all you brothers who are who are willing to do that put your neck on the line to be able to uh to to be a part and a help to the body of Christ uh brother Andrew Glover will be here I just texted him this morning so the Lord willing he'll be here Saturday night Sunday morning Saturday night at six o'clock don't miss those Services if you can brother Andrew is a mighty minister of of the gospel and and a great preacher of this message and so we want to we want to be here if you can for Saturday night and then Sunday morning Saturday at 6:00 Sunday at 10:00 and uh the Lord willing will have those Services let's stand together once again sorry to have you up and down but I know for some of you it's difficult to stand for a long time turn with me to Isaiah chapter 49 Isaiah 49: 5 through 7 we'll we'll begin here if you will try to pay attention this morning there's some things that I want to say that I want to make clear to us and and I know that they probably are in your minds and your hearts already but there's things that we need to understand and and there's things that we need to know where we're at and and we've been preaching on uh issues of family and the mind and and and Christian living things like that and this morning I want to lift us up just a little bit and we're going to look at the word and what it means to us and and the word is the most important thing that's why we put most of our service towards the preaching of the word is not to promote a man not to promote a Ministry but it's because the word is what will change your life it's the word and that word is Anointed by the spirit of God to to do miraculous things in your life and so we thank God for the word today and and we want to we want to focus on that this morning I want to title this before and after the open book we'll begin with Isaiah 49 95 and now saith the Lord that formed me from the the womb to be his servant to bring Jacob again to him though Israel be not gathered yet shall I be glorious in the eyes of the Lord and my God shall be my strength now notice how he says God formed me and created me for this purpose to bring Jacob again to him and this is speaking of the Messiah he was created for this purpose to bring Jacob again to him to to be a redeemer for Israel for natural Israel but though Israel be not gathered yet shall I be glorious in the eyes of the Lord my God should be my strength and he said it is a light thing that thou should us be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob and to restore the preserved of Israel he said I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles aren't you glad he did that we wouldn't be here if it wasn't for that promise so he said I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles and that thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the Earth and verse 7 says thus say the Lord the Redeemer of Israel and His Holy One to whom to him whom man despiseth to him whom the nation abh whth to a servant of rulers Kings shall see and arise princes also shall worship because the Lord that is faithful I'm glad that he's faithful today the Lord that is faithful amen and the Holy One of Israel and he shall choose Thee I pray the Lord would add his Blessing to the word you may be seated this morning Isaiah is obviously speaking of the Messiah and he gives us a glimpse of the Plan of Redemption in fact you can look in Isaiah and see the entire Plan of Redemption in the book of Isaiah perhaps more than any other book and in the 66th chapters I believe of the book of Isaiah and we see the Fulfillment of verses 5 through 7 in Acts 13 when Paul and Barnabas waxed bold and said it was necessary that the word of God should first spoken to you they're talking to the Jewish people of that day to the Jewish leaders of that day he said it was necessary that it was first spoken to you but seeing you put it from you judge yourselves Unworthy of everlasting life how did they do that by rejecting the word he said you judged yourselves Unworthy of everlasting life he said Lo we turn to the Gentiles for soath the Lord commanded us saying I have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles that thou should us be for salvation unto the ends of the Earth and when the Gentiles heard this they were glad and glorified the word of the Lord and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed and the word of the Lord was published throughout all the region and so if you go back and look in that chapter that we read in Isaiah uh in in chapter 49 if you go back and look through the entire book of Isaiah in fact through the entire Bible you'll find that Jesus Christ is the entire Plan of Redemption right he is the entire Plan of Redemption and and that's why everything before Christ pointed to Christ right it was all a type and a shadow pointing to something pointing to Christ everything after him points back to him that's right right and so he is the entire Plan of Redemption then how could we dwell on him too much how could we talk about him too much are you with me how could we they accuse brother brandom of of uh of talking too much about Jesus of of talking too much about his deity and and you know I wish I could be accused of that I hope that's all they could accuse me of they they talk about him uh we we talk about him too little if anything at all but when we talk about him he comes around and we need him don't we he is the entire Plan of Redemption he he's the whole book he said in the volume of the book it's written of me every word of it brother Brandon said if you don't see him there then go back and read it again right because he is the entire Plan of Redemption now in the unveiling of God and this is a sermon that people misunderstand so much but it's so wonderful to us as as the bride of Christ that brother Brandon preaches on the unveiling of God he's he's not unveiling himself he's showing that God is veiled behind flesh and it's the unveiling of God and and so he said he did it in the reformers taking on a veil he said taking on a veil until finally it come down to the Lutheran age down to the other age he said it comes out into the complete now he said it come down to the Lutheran Age come down to the other age just like back there it come through Moses and it come through Elijah and it come through all the prophets and it come out in the complete right the fullness of the godhead he said now it come through Luther and it come through the other age it finally comes out in the complete he said and just before it comes a prophet arises again now what kind of a prophet would that be it would be like John right they could say Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world he said just before it comes a prophet arises again he said what it does it foreshadows the word it foreshadows the word that's what the prophet appearing on the scene would show us that the word was coming right a prophet appearing on the scene would show us that Christ was coming the word and so John didn't didn't come to promote himself he come to promote the word and brother bam told told it this way he said he didn't say behold my Baptist behold my Methodist behold my Pentecostal he said Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world then if there's anybody that ought to be excited about Christ it's us it's us because we we see the fullness of him we see him for who he really is we see him not only as a savior but a Healer not only as a god of yesterday but a god of yesterday today and forever not only has a God that existed back 2,000 years ago but a God that exists today and he's a Healer do you believe that today he's a savior he's a miracle worker we know that that's true I see sister frit sitting back there this morning she knows today God's A Healer Brother David can testify out streaming this morning God's a healer how many of you can testify that he's a Healer why he's the same yesterday today and forever this message didn't take Christ away from you it pointed you to Christ it it was it was the very message itself that showed them who Christ was Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world oh that ought to make us excited today to know that we we've seen him we can see who he really is what it does he said it foreshadows the word showing back here revealing what's been done what's been left off that the church will be not without understanding so the church had have understanding now he said when this then when this Fades out then like John said I must decrease he must increase then all it all comes into him amen you see what age we live in it's everything being wrapped up in Christ not in a preacher not in a church not in a cult not in a theology not in a denomination but Christ having the preeminence Among Us amen God won't let anybody else take that preeminent position not in the bride you start lifting a man up to a preeminent position God will bring him down because the now in the bride we won't have a preeminent man but it'll be the preeminence of Christ because that's why a prophet came amen amen he said then he is fully manifested through Luther through Wesley and Pentecostal age and on down on down he said he is fully manifested you see come down just the manifestation God unfolding he said see him now notice fulfilled in his promises for this day as they had amen his promises for this day he said he would do certain things in this day and he's done those things we should have Supreme confidence in the message of the our young people should have Supreme confidence in the message of the hour we shouldn't be easily dissuaded or persuaded to go some other direction why because this message it shows us exactly what God was said he would do and it did it and it's doing it in the bride today exactly what he said he would do now brother BR said Moses was the word that day he said because the word was given to him for that day Moses he said Joseph was the word in his his days portraying Christ exactly each one of them was the word he said and when Jesus came he was the word in its fullness because the whole Plan of Redemption laid in him he said the whole Plan of Redemption didn't lay in Moses didn't lay in Joseph didn't lay in Elijah see they were only part of the word pointing to it see he said now notice keep your thought he said here it comes as I say see the whole plan wasn't in them they were pointing to it therefore after him the fullness we cannot point to something else it points back to him the word and brother Brandon picks up his Bible he says this is the complete Revelation nothing can be added or taken away from it there is the complete Revelation and if there ever was a Bible believing people it ought to be us if the Bible say you say well I'm waiting on a special Revelation not even brother brandham could get a special Revelation outside of the Bible it's true brother brandom even said that if God would do that he said maybe he had the authority to do that but it would be wrong a revelation outside of the word right and then so whatever Revelation we've caught that's outside of the word couldn't be right it has to be wrong because this is the complete Revelation nothing can be added or taken away from it he said there is the complete Revelation he said all that he said a shadow of him to come but when he come he was the perfect Hebrews 1 God in sunry times spoke to the fathers through the prophets God spoke through veils the prophets but in this last days through his son Jesus Christ there you are he says unveiled out there on Calvary the Son of God unveiled he said notice Made Alive and today when the word I love this is manifested in human vessels amen he didn't just say the word manifested in a human vessel not even just the human vessel Christ but what did God do all that God was he poured into Christ all that Christ was he poured into the church and we saw God manifested in a human vessel in William brandham but now we see God in human vessels amen veils he said it's absolutely the word fulfilled in that day which comes back to God amen amen now he said being baptized into him according to 1 Corinthians 12 we become identified with him amen now in in 1965 in events made clear by prophecy brother BR says for the Bible is a living foretold witness of Jesus Christ and as the Earth has grown into its fullness also Vines grow into their fullness he said the day grows into its fullness the Bible was manifested in his fullness in the person of Jesus Christ he was the word of God revealed the whole Complete Book of redemption now the Plan of Redemption is a prophecy in the Old Testament fulfilled in the New Testament you look at the Plan of Redemption you see the prophecy coming when when when God himself made a prophecy and he said he began to say uh thy seed will will bruise his his head and it'll bruise his heel and he made the prophecy over the serpent the serpent seed what it would do and what the woman seed would do and the prophecy come from there and it come down through the line of Judah and it come out finally in the birth of Jesus Christ and all these prophets in the meantime prefigured him and they were the word but they were not the fullness of the word and then it come down to his birth that's an event of of redemption and then to his death an event he had to be born he had to die an event of redemption his burial was an event of redemption it was a part of the Plan of Redemption he had to be buried for three days and there's things certain things that had to take place during that time we find his resurrection a part of redemption because he had to be raised so we could be raised right he was the first one the wave shief the first one to come up we find so he that was his resurrection we find then he went into interceding for us his intercession he sat on the throne and he made intercession for us aren't you glad for that part of redemption today he's ever interceding the Bible says he's there he's interceding for you and we have an advocate the Bible says with the father any man sin we have an advocate aren't you glad for that Advocate today so there's intercession but there's one more part of redemption and that's his claiming work right that's his claiming work he he he was he was born he was died he was buried he was resurrected he interceded and then he comes to claim those who he interceded for at some point The Plan of Redemption completes does that make sense this comes around and so now we've seen the Jewish part of it the Gentile part of it and now him claiming what he has redeemed and when we go and look in Revelation when we see the book open and we'll go to those scriptures in a moment we see the book open what is that he's claiming what he has redeemed now the opening of the book is the great event of redemption in the end times it signifies the lamb is asserting his rights to what he redeemed they're already his you were his before he ever was born death burial Resurrection all of that you were already his right you were in in the mind of God before the foundation of the world right you had to be but but now he's actually fulfilling just as he actually fulfilled the the birth the death the burial the Resurrection The intercession he's fulfilling the claiming work in this day he's making his Redemption claims see he's opening the book he's coming out of his intercession place to make a claim on what he has already redeemed how does he do that how do you how do you know who you are today as a Christian by the word right and there's something inside of you that that accepts that if you boil it down and you may have shouted you may have spoken tongues you may have you may have run all over the church and and I've done that too I believe in that and I will again the Lord willing God never took those things out of the church but that's not how I know that I've been redeemed how do I Know Who I Am by the word of the hour there's something inside of me that that that just believes that I can't be nothing else you could come and and bring another a word of another age a light of another age you you can't present that to Mary Mary knew what her age was what the light was why an angel come to her and said blessed art thou among women huh she knew who she was Paul knew who he was and and all through the church AG brother brand recognized who he was but now we have to recognize who we are and he Reveals His word he makes his claims on Earth by revealing his word and so during this time as he takes the book he opens the book and he comes to claim his subjects and then what happens it opens up or it begins the process of rapture and Resurrection now look that couldn't happen till this day and I'll I'll show that to you now brother B said in the breach he said the first thing that represented that Redemption come the lamb that had been slain from the foundation of the world he said he took the book opened the book tore off the seals we know it wasn't a book like this but a scroll seal with Seven Seals he tore off the seals he said and sent it down to the Earth to a seventh angel to reveal it to his people he said well where does brother brandham get that Revelation 10 right he gets that from Revelations 10 Revelation 10:1 I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with the cloud and the rainbow was upon his head his feet was at were the Sun and his feet his face was as it were the sun his feet as pillars of fire and his hand a little book open and he said his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the earth and he cried with a loud voice as when a lion Roth and when he had cried seven Thunders uttered their voices and when the seven Thunders had uttered their voices he said I was about to ride I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven Thunders uttered and write them not why he was still interceding his claiming work what hadn't begun yet are you with me now and we we don't understand God sometimes because he's still interceding today day but the days of ignorance are passed right now now we have to we see God unveiled just like in the Old Testament he was inter they were interceded for they they had a priest go in and they God accepted a substitute but one day he didn't accept that anymore the ve was rent and there he was in plain view and today he's in plain view in the word right and that's the the time that we moved into into this claiming time not that he doesn't intercede anymore but we're in the claiming time does that make sense we're still in the latery and church age but yet we're in the bride age we're we're to be called out of that called up high he said come up hither amen amen that's the day that we're living in now he said and the angel which I saw upon the sea and upon the Earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever which created heaven and the things that there in are the earth and the things that there in are in the sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer but in the day of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as Heath declared to his servants the prophets where did that open book come from come from Revelation 5 the lamb came and took it he opened it up and he put his feet on the land and the Sea and he handed it to the seventh angel in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he should begin to sound but the in make that up that's what the Bible says now and he brother brand says this in the breach again he said when the seals are broken the mystery is revealed down comes the angel the messenger Christ setting his foot upon the land upon the sea with a rainbow over his head he said and now remember the seventh angels on Earth at the time of this coming at the time of this coming so whenever that takes place I I see the thing is if you don't believe that the book is open and that's not what I'm preaching about this morning but I just want to drop this in if we don't believe that the book is open then we can't believe that we have to believe brother bram's coming back right because if the book isn't open brother brandham has to come back and be there when that angel comes down right because that's what he said the seventh angel is on Earth he comes down he gives it to the seventh angel but in the days of the voice is the seventh angel but now I I want to look at the difference that this open book made you see there was a time it wasn't open there was a time that it was and I believe and you're welcome to believe whatever you want to I won't run you off but I believe that the book is open because I see what it did for us and brother BR since the book opened the Bible become a new book since it was open it the Bible become a new book and you see how we can see where we are and who we are and how gives us Faith to live out everyday lives it doesn't make us some kind of super people and a super race somewhere but it just gives us the faith to believe and know who we are the book is open I believe that now you take a picture of Heaven if you were recording you know we used to have those old VHS Cam quars and set them right here and watch if you could now we have our phones if you could have been there in heaven when John was there or whatever that scene was that place in that Vision or wherever John was caught up to you could be there and see the throne room and see all the the the elders and the beasts and all of these wonderful sites and you see a bloody lamb come out now look look at how that that picture or that movie if we can say that video would change as you go along because before this takes place they don't know how that claiming work is to happen or how if he's ever going to take that book of names that book of redemption right and so there's weeping in heaven there's sadness right John is weeping everything there's a loud voice you can see it going out it's a serious time who is worthy right to open the book who is worthy and they looked at everything they looked at me and you and everybody else said he's not worthy Isaac's not worthy Ben's not worthy nobody's worthy who is worthy that no Prophet was worthy who worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and what a a thought that was to John well H how can redemption ever be complete you see and what that does is before see the fullness of redemption is the change of our bodies right we haven't received the fullness of his claiming work yet because that's the fullness of it is is the change of our bodies but that's been set in motion before he takes the book just like in the Old Testament before he he died on Calvary they could only hope and look forward to something they could look at it and say this is what's coming we believe a messiah is coming and some of them still do that today because they don't have a revelation of who he is they say there's a messiah coming there's a messiah coming but they've been saying that for thousands of years but one day God himself testified and said he's here he he was there on a cross he was hanging there dying bleeding for our sins he's here so before that there's sadness there there's there's worry there's trouble because you know we know we're going to have trouble down here we still have trouble down here 2020 is going to happen and 2021 hasn't got off to such a great start either these things are going to happen life is full of it if you go back in history you'll find heartache after heartache after heartache but the thing about Christians Paul said if in this life only we have hope we're of all men most miserable right because if we only have hope in this life why not just eat drink and be marry you're going to die anyway right but but now he says there's a Resurrection coming but now this was a hope it was a hope to just think about those ones that were laid away in the grave there in Palestine Abraham and all those ones were laying there and and they waited in paradise whatever that it was waiting on that day and then when the graves were open here they come what it was a completely different atmosphere after than it was before the atmosphere of Heaven changed and if you look at what happened in this when the seals were open that the actual atmosphere of Heaven changed from this serious time when they were worried and concerned and John was weeping to a rejoicing and a and a and a wonder and a great a a great worship that began to take place why because the book was open now what happened here the opening of the word said in motion the events of the Rapture and Resurrection now there's one thing for the word to be spoken another thing for it to begin to come to pass you see we can look at and we'll read in a moment but we can look at the parts of the Bible that speak about the Rapture and say this part has already taken place did you know that now not that we know there's going to be a literal body change right there's going to be we'll see Jesus brother brandom said we'll see him in a literal body he said that's what Believers believe we'll see in a Corporal body but but we know that it's begun it's begun that's what a prophet taught us now look before it hadn't begun now it has this is astounding I don't think we realize what what this message means and what it means to be a believer of it and what it means to be a Christian in this day huh it puts us on the other side are you with me now here was this side was was was mourning here on this side if you look at the Old Testament was all these things but now you're not only in the New Testament with all the grace and the glory of God but now you're at the very end of his claiming work and you can see the event set in motion because the resurrection cannot happen till the lamb takes the book right that's why again if you don't believe the book is open then you have to believe brother brandom's going to come back if if he was the seventh angel Earthly messenger you have to believe he's coming back because you'd have to believe that it's got to happen yet so you're waiting on him to come back and there's no biblical proof of that right and nothing in the message to tell us that right and and it's one or the other you can't really have any in between because it has to be that Messenger right it's his message that and that's where you talk about separating the message and the messenger and and we don't want to separate that we realize he came with a message right and so he was on the earth at that time but his message was like John Behold the Lamb of God behold the word now look so the resurrection cannot happen till the lamb takes the book listen what brother Brown says in the breach he said but now he comes from here at this last seal he said he's no more mediator he's King now and what does he do if he's a king he has to have subjects brother Brandon puts it so simply here if he's a king he has to have subjects and his subjects is them that he has redeemed and they cannot come before him until he takes the rights of redemption amen how can you come before him until he takes the right don't you see it's not what you do we cannot work ourselves into into Redemption you can't do that no more than they could in the Old Testament no matter what they did they could be no more redeemed than just a covering for sin until Christ came himself and did it for them and don't you realize we could not work ourselves into Redemption today there had to come a a lamb that come and took the book and opened the book and revealed the seals there had that had to happen we couldn't work our way into Redemption and that becomes a struggle as as young people and as as we become older even sometimes it's a struggle because in our minds we think well I'm not everything that I should be but that's not what it's up to he come and took the book there was one worthy you were not worthy you couldn't begin the process of redemption neither can you bring about a resurrection that's why I get concerned whenever I see people that are looking for something to happen and I believe there will be things happen but you can't make them happen brother Brandon gives us certain things promises about about the end times about before the Rapture and certain things that'll take place and I believe to me everything that has to happen has happened right but but he talks about a move of God and the the Revival being on for the bride again we got have to participate in that right it's already on but but there's uh he talks about things there could be many things take place that we could see brother brandom talked about how in the last hour or two all those prophecies before Jesus death all those prophecies come to pass so it could all be happening today and you wouldn't know it right but but I believe that everything's ready we're living in that time it could be any day or any hour even in the things we know but but when you begin to look at those things and and realize that there's nothing that I can do I'm not going to get into a resurrection because I follow a certain preacher and listen to a certain preacher in the message that's not going to put me in Resurrection if if God would leave me God forbid I I plan on being here the rest of my life if you all will put up with me but God forbid God would lead me to go to Colorado or California I would go there and I'd stand up here in the pulpit and say now y'all that want to go with me you come on not one of you would have to go huh why your Resurrection is not dependent on me this is just an old flesh an old old uh Corpus they say this one's a little bigger than most but it's there you know it's just you know it's just the Flesh and God speaks I believe God speaks to the ministry I believe that with all my heart but if God if if I pass away if something happened to me and the resurrection hasn't taken place the Rapture hasn't taken place then I believe that it'll be somebody else someone else will stand in this pulpit and preach to you the word right and it won't be dependent on say well I have to hear this one I if I could just hear that or if I could just be under that anointing listen the anointing is on the age you're an eagle are you with me today you're an ego it's not dependent I don't want to put down coming to church because I believe in church I believe in going to church I believe that Christians go to church that's what Christians do go to church but that's not going to put you in a resurrection paying your ties is not going to Rapture you but you do that because you know the the book's been open is claiming his is redemption work has been done not just a Christ of history but he's been made real to us today now brother Brown says he comes from here he said at the last oh I backed up a little bit I'm sorry that thing actually keeps me from backing up too much so youall should be grateful for that I tend to repeat myself now and I hate that too and he said now he walks forth from a mediator where death put us in the grave now notice what he does where he from a mediator where death put us in the grave he comes forth with the rights death put us in the grave he comes forth with the rights and even those who are alive and remain till his coming shall not hinder them which are asleep for the trumpet of God shall sound at that last trumpet when the last seal is broke when the seventh angel is giving his message the last trumpet shall sound and the dead in Christ shall rise and I'm sure the people sitting there under that prophetic word thought oh it's happening right now tomorrow night we're going to be in the Rapture tomorrow morning as soon as that seven seal is open we're going to be there but the part that wasn't open is we didn't know the day or the hour right and here we are all these years later but that promise is still true we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them to meet him in the air he said he claims that's his claiming work his claiming work is not just to make you a message believer it's to Rapture you yes it's not just to say I believe the message it's not just to say I I'm in a New Movement it's not to bring you into a new church age no church ages are over that that's before right denominations are before the opening of the word won't be another denomination now not one with that that God starts see God started those movements that became denominations but this movement that God started won't become a denomination it can't this bride can't fall all are you with me now because it's going up time amen the last cycle is has spin itself out now it's it's stopped if you ever took a top and just spun it on the ground or on a table and you take that that little top it's the thing kids used to play with and you take it and you spin that thing and when you do it spins for a while and what does it do it slows down and finally it stops where are we at we're at the last Revolution of that last turn uh as it's slowly stopping and then it falls over it's done are you with me now that's where we're at amen amen when the last seal is broke he claims he's come forth now to claim his possession 1 Thessalonians 4:13 but I would not have you to be ignorant Brethren concerning them which are asleep that you sorrow not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again even so them also sleep in Jesus will God bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord shall not prevent or hinder them which are asleep for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout notice how he comes he'll descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first amen we're going to see him one of these days the dead in Christ shall rise first and then we which are alive and remain oh I want to be one of of those he didn't just say alive but alive and remain amen Amen Alive and remain we which are alive and remain should be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air so shall we ever be with the Lord amen from that moment on even during the the the tribulation period we're at the marriage supper of the Lamb during the Thousand-Year Reign we're there with him in the city after that we're still with him we're ever going to be with the Lord amen wherefore Comfort one another with these words ever since Paul wrote those words Christians all down through history have been listening for that shout right because they knew if the shout took place then the voice would come and the trumpet but they were listening for the shout because the shout was the indication of his coming brother B says three things happen a voice a shout a voice of trumpet has to happen before Jesus appears he said now I shout he said Jesus does all three of them when he's descending are you still with me this morning amen I I love to preach on these things I just just bear with me if none of y'all if it doesn't help you any it helps me so y'all just pray for me this morning I'll get some help listen he says a shout he said Jesus does all three of them when he's descending a shout what is the shout it's the message going forth first the living bread of of Life bringing forth the bride amen this is the seventh Angel's message are you with me now you realize if you say well I'm in the message well when it's been turned around say well there the message in you but if that message message is in you you realize what you're saying I'm in the rapture if I go by way of the Grave I'm in the resurrection you're saying I won't partake of the second death and then people live just any way they want to say well I'm in the message you know if the message can't take you and change you from what you were to what he wants you to be how do you expect it to take you in a Rapture right and so but to be in the message is not to conform to a certain set of Creeds or dogmas but it's to actually have the living life of Christ inside of you amen this one who revealed himself to us in this age just to be that manifested word are you with me now now this is the seventh Angel's message in the first seal brother B said until it comes to that last Angel speaking of these seven Church Angel Messengers until it comes to that last angel now he has no certain mystery but he gathers up all that's been lost in them mother ages and then today people try to point things at brother brandom and say well he he plagiarized things he didn't plagiarize near as much as I do most of my sermon is quotes in scriptures I hope we can quote what the Bible says what the scripture says and brother random took all these Lo sins some of the things he he took and he said it he got went to L and he went to all these other things he didn't take word for word what they said but what did he do he come and he brought it all together because these men had Revelation they they were a part of the word for their day they were Bride for their day but not all of it right so the angel messenger at the last Church age messenger has no certain mystery but it gathers up all that's been lost in the mother ages all the truths that wasn't truly revealed yet see they had part of it they had it in a in a form or in a fashion not the truth of it he said see as the Revelation come or not all the truth of it he said as the Revelation come then he reveals those things in his day now if you want to know who the messenger is look what what happens after this message Goes Forth what result does this message have look at John Wesley John Wesley to to us would be a lesser messenger than Whitfield or Spurgeon who come later as far as what he believed doctrinally Whitfield and Spurgeon were both doctrinally greater but go and read Spurgeon you'll you'll ID he says I'm like a candle me in front of John Wesley even though he didn't agree with him doctrinally he said it's like the candle in front of the Sun as far as the impact our Ministries has had and and Whitfield was the same way Whitfield was a great preacher but his ministry had no lasting impact like John Wesley did why because God chose him John Wesley to be the messenger of the hour because he didn't need that fullness yet what he needed was sanctification right that was the part Wesley was bringing and so he brought that part in such a way and God anointed that Ministry and brought it out in such a way that that it it changed the world that then was and look what happened what did God do there was l of other healing revivalists lots of people who could speak better as far as use more proper English than brother brandham lots of people who had healings and miracles take place but what happened there was an impact there was a message that went forth and it did something and you say well it just created chaos and misunderstanding you can't tell me that that's not what it did in my life it it calmed the chaos brought understanding the message didn't do that people do that huh but the message doesn't bring chaos and misunderstanding message brings understanding because it's the light of the hour and so we need to be careful how we talk about it and how we talk about message people frankly because the Believers this hour won't be perfect nobody said they would be perfect but you're still the bride I didn't make you that he made you that now there may be three kinds of Believers but he didn't tell me which was which he never gave me an Insight on that you got to know that for yourself but it's not up to me to put you in or out that's up to God I have to preach the word the word put you in or out right you can either say I reject it and Paul like Paul said he said you took your you counted yourself Unworthy of eternal life by rejecting the word oh God help us today God it don't matter it cut us to the to the very depth of our soul but GL it may take us to a point we we don't even we're scared to see what it'll do to us but it but we've got to accept it if it's the word of God it's not just a man saying but a word of God brought by as brought under the light of the message of hour we look at that and we think God let it be let it cut me if it has to cut me let it let it tear me up if it's got to tear me up why I've got to I've got to become that word and it's not up to me to well you say I wish I could live it but it's not up to me to live it it's up to him to live it through me amen I just have to surrender to it I can't I don't want to be taken I don't want to be count myself Unworthy of eternal life God help me today now listen he says he says until it comes that last Angel there's no certain mystery we read that the next quote he says he said if you want to read it there it is Revelations 101 to about 4 he said you'll get it he said see he takes the book and seals and breaks them and shows the seventh angel listen for this alone the mysteries of God is the ministry of the seventh angel it's not my Ministry it's the ministry of the seventh angel that that was his job notice he said the very day this is in the anointed on at end time when this messenger not when he starts but when he begins to declare his message I've read this to you before you probably heard it many times but listen to it in the light of this before and after the open book he says not when he starts on but when he begins to declare his message he said see the first pole healing second pole prophesying third poll the opening of the word the Mysteries revealed he said there's no more higher order to reveal the word than prophets but the only way the prophet can be Vindicated is by the word but people don't want to leave enough time for it to be Vindicated that's right there's some things that brother Brown said that there's some things we believe in this message won't be Vindicated until the w takes place but I still believe it right because when that change of the body comes he'll be Vindicated in all that he said until then you you can you can try to prove anybody wrong say Well it hasn't come to pass yet until we're there and we have perfect understanding we don't know right and he's a prophet speaking just like this word has been opened up to us and then there's things that he said he wasn't saying about himself he was saying in Prophecy now look he said no more there's no more higher order to reveal the word than prophets but the only way the prophet can be Vindicated is by the the word he said and remember the third poll was the opening of them Seven Seals to reveal the hidden truth that's been sealed in the word he said do you see it now brother bram's identifying that as the third poll of his ministry right it's the way I read that he's he's identifying the third poll is his ministry is the opening of them Seven Seals to reveal the hidden truth now this message is absolutely necessary for the Rapture if you ever watch a movie left behind left behind anybody no one wants to admit to that got one hand back there I heard they redid it I but the old movie left behind and and they had the Rapture taking place and they were telling how many people went and they said oh hundreds of millions right and they had all of the children under a certain age would go and all the every everybody you know all the and so airplanes were crashing all over the place and that's what they had to start in the the beginning of the tribulation period but again God doesn't do things like that when he come the first time how many received it huh and Jesus said it'll be in a day and hour you don't even you don't even think you're not even thinking about it it'll be it'll be so secret and and it'll be a sudden secret going away of the church the bride is caught away in the middle of the night brother Brown said like Romeo and Juliet caught away and there'll be people missing there will be people who will know but not many in fact I'd say there'll be a lot of churches even around the message that'll keep going right and I and I don't say that just because I want to I I hope this one will be empty especially the pastor I think on that movie the pastor didn't go with the church that's kind of sad but you know I I I I hope we're we're all there but the truth is people go on and there'll be people who know about the message that won't go absolutely will be because there's millions that know about the message right but there won't be I I can't see where there'll be that many gold brother random uses an extreme example but he talks about 500 and now that that's not brother brandom is just giving us showing us it'll be small right what's small you could take those same figures brother Brown used during that day there was a billion Christians I think he said or 500 million in the world 500 million he said one in a million be 500 well there's way more people than that that call themselves Christians today so if you want to do Mathew you say well there's more and then you can say well how many true Christians I don't think there was 500 million true Christians in that day but look at how Jesus did it in the first time now I've gone off on a Lord help me I hate it when preachers chase rabbits but you know we we look at this and we realize that there won't be that many It'll be such a but what what do we need what is necessary for that well this message is necessary right it's absolutely necessary for the Rapture and now there will be many saved there will be many that will the foolish version whoever that is whatever that is however you want to you want to put that in that's not my purpose today to preach on that but but it's the elect who recognized MDC not lot coming out of Sodom but the elect group amen recognized mesic and got the body change right and so there's some people that are magnetized to it by something what makes you magnetized to it amen now brother BR sister there's a great magnet sitting in the sky that God one day will touch his fingers to now he's you know it's a type it's an allegory it's not that you're literally going to raise up like a magnet but God one day will touch his fingers to the magnet no man knows the time he's coming not even the angels of heaven doesn't know God Alone knows but there's been some trimmings that's come off of the Bible Bible Christians Believers for this hour he said one of them might have been an axle back in another day this might be some other part it's going on to make the big regime of God but it'll be molded into the pot of God's Great Cupa and poured out again into the images of God I love this and just those who are magnetized to it will be taken up now what's magnet magnetization it's attraction all right something in the object beat that is magnetized to it is attracted to the magnet there's a material there somewhere that's attracted to the magnet it's attraction there's something there it can't help it amen amen it's attraction he said now oh he said what a privilege it is to know that there's something in the resurrection that's pertaining to us amen so not just the magnet out in the sky but a magnet in here something in here a material here that's magnetized to it he said we are we are magnetized to it now what does it do it draws us what is that that's his his claiming work of redemption now we are attracted to it now we are not only attracted to the messenger but to the word right this is important we are claimed by the word now and brother BR goes into this we had to be attracted by the messenger initially or we wouldn't believe the message but the attraction changes when we realize what he's saying I'm not saying this by myself brother Bram says this look brother brand says in choosing of a bride Christ does vindicate his word which attracts the people he does that we saw brother the random do things that only God could do God living in a man and so it God does vindicate his vindicates his word which attracts the people he said he don't attract the people at churches that are attracted by big denominations and big doings and big carry-ons and fancy things H aren't you glad for that fancy we tried to make it fancy around here sometimes we fail but we're still AR arens say it that way but the word of God attracts the bride of Christ I didn't say that he said that God speaking through his Prophet the word of God attracts the attention of God he said the word of God attracts the bride of Christ he said now notice it's interesting to notice how that the church tries to attract the attention of the People by fine robes and dressed choirs and bobbed haired women and painted faces and they think it sang like an angel lie like a devil run around all night to a dance like think nothing about it and that's what they think it's all right it's beautiful they're attracted to that huh why because the flesh is attracted to that people want a pastor who does whatever he wants to so they can be a people that do whatever they want to but if the pastor is bound to the word then the people are bound to the word are you with me and vice versa now but they they like lie like a devil run around all night to a dance like think nothing about it they think that's beautiful but you see that's false made that's not the word of God he said well the true bride I love this so we are attracted to him but he said the true bride attracts the attention of God by keeping his word you ever notice how a little girl she begins to like a guy a teenager many more years from my girls where they start doing this but they like a guy and they'll start dressing up real nice maybe put on a necklace fix that messy bun up just right other times they begin to act if it's the wrong kind of guy you know a lot of times they'll act the opposite they'll start getting rebellious and and speaking bad to their parents stuff like that well they're trying to attract someone's attention right and they get attention just as a side note they get attention from somewhere and and they're going to get it from somewhere if if we as dads don't give them the attention they deserve especially our girls they'll look for it somewhere they'll get attention because there's something in in in that female species something in their psyche they they want attention huh that's why your your wife will talk to you all the time she's trying to get your attention she she wants your attention she it's not that she's it's not necessarily about what she says because she's already told you that five times she wants your attention and I have to realize this sometimes because I'm a as much as I repeat myself preaching I don't like to hear things repeated if I heard it once that's enough and my wife would tell I get very frustrated on the phone or whatever somebody's talking to me I I don't like to hear things repeated I got it the first time I'm never going to remember it no matter how many times you repeat it to me but it's just my nature I'm ready to move on to something else let's talk about something else but but you talk about about women they're wanting that attention they're they're looking for attention from a man and and look the bride of Christ is looking for attention to attract his attention how do I attract his attention the true bride attracts the attention of God by keeping his word amen not by having the biggest church not by having the greatest preacher not by having all these nice things that we have that's not how we attract God's attention we attract his attention by keeping his word and He blesses us with his presence why because we're keeping the word how how did Esther attract the attention of the king all the other girls they got all doled up and ready and here come Esther and she said whatever you tell me to put on that's what I'll put on the king's unic who knew what the king liked amen he knew what the king liked the king servant knew what the king liked and so he told her put this on put that on and she went before the king and exactly what he told her don't you realize that's the way we attract the attention of God Amen what is the attraction on the mountain brother brandham love the title of that sermon brother brandham preaches that what is the attraction on the mountain it's not a very long sermon go and listen to it sometime the BR says one day an ordinary young man about 30 years old walked down and was baptized and when this man come he said there was such an attraction by the prophet in other words the prophet was attracting the attention of the people right there was such an attraction by the prophet he said the prophet acts strange that day he said and the congregation couldn't help from watching the action of that Prophet you saw it you think this is different here's a man who preaches what the word says here's a man who's different see all the other great men of that day they had great big robes and fine churches and here come John out of the wilderness he acted different different than everybody else did all the other Pentecostals got out there and and screamed and hollered and tried to cast out devils and here come a man with authority he was different and it attracted the attention of the people just it's the way he acted L he said when he was debating with the priests across the river they said God built this altar God told us to do this Moses is the prophet We Believe Moses the sacrifice will never be done away with they had word bible for that but they didn't understand it wasn't revealed to them and I can hear John answer back and said have you not read in the scriptures now notice what he begins to do he begins to tell him who he is have you not read in the scriptures what Daniel the Prophet said the daily sacrifice will be done away with and that hour has arrived amen he stood there as the Manifest the word that day he said this is that that hour has arrived the daily sacrifice will be done away with have you not read what is Isaiah said in the 40th chapter the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare the way of the Lord how many times do we hear Brother Brown say something similar to that talk about what happened on the river talk about what happened in his own Ministry he's doing the same thing John did and the people were attracted to that he said there's two prophecies for me there is two prophecies for me so he's showing the prophecies in Scripture that pertain to his own Ministry John's Ministry he said another thing did not you recognize our Prophet 400 years ago Malachi when he spoke in the third chapter amen and he said he said behold I sent my messenger before my face to prepare the way don't you know this fulfills prophecy prophecy was being fulfilled notice he's attracting the attention of the people the first pole and the second pole and all the things in his ministry he's attracting he's different than what the world was he's different he's attracting the attention of the people and about that time the prophet turned and said behold there comes the Lamb of God the prophet turned in his ministry and said behold there comes the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the World Church he turned amen now what's the attraction I didn't say this this brother bram's words now what's the attraction it changed from the prophet to his prophecy people would tell you every little thing that John done and that's wonderful that was part of the attraction but he turned said behold the word amen people can't see the prophet turn that's why they they can't understand the message of the hour God help us to see it today he said look how the atmosphere look how the atmosphere of Heaven changed after John saw the lamb take the book let's look at that for a moment before we close Revelation 51 and I saw the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside seal with Seven Seals I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in Heaven Nor in Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look there on and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look there on and one of the elders saith unto me weep not Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David have prevailed amen he's conquered he's prevailed he's overcome to open the book and to loose the Seven Seals thereof and I beheld and low in the midst of the Throne of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the Earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne notice how everything everybody's holding their breath everybody's wondering what's going to happen he came and take the book took the book out of the right hand of him that said on the throne and when he had taken the book notice when he had taken the book Things begin to change the four beasts and the 4 and20 Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them Harps and golden vows full of odors which are the prayers of saints amen what what was that praying for brother Bram told us he said it's for a resurrection they were praying for a resurrection amen what happened it changed before there was a hope of a resurrection now there was a reality of a resurrection amen can you see where I was Tak you with the Shout with brother's message all these things what was it doing it was bringing into a reality it was manifesting the word so we could see because there's going to be some hard times there's going to be some tough some trouble this bride this bride is going to be attacked on every side but we've been shown by God that there's something real about the Rapture amen not just a hope but a reality thank you Lord they sung a new song How Art Worthy to take the book to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and has redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred and tongue and people and nation has made us under our God Kings and Priests we shall reign on the earth and I beheld and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders and the number of them was 10,000 time 10,000 and thousands of thousands there's going to be some body in heaven there's already Heaven is already popul you don't have to worry about it being empty God already has it popular he knows every spot to fill notice sang with a loud voice sing with what kind of a voice loud voice amen a loud voice why because it' been just a hope you know in reality boil it down all your life what what's the greatest hope in your life well you look and say well it's to get married or to have a good job or to be able to retire with money what's the greatest hope of your life the farther along you go the more of your friends that pass away it's a resurrection it has to be and I stood by Graves I stood by different kinds of Graves and done funeral services for people that and some that you you just didn't know and you prayed for God's mercy there's others I Stood Beside their grave and I've always read that the scripture at the grave in 1 Thessalonians 4 he talks about the Rapture and the resurrection I've all read that the graves that Comfort one another with these words because that's the greatest hope that I have I can't put hope in politics where's that going to take me you put all your hope in politics you end up like that guy that put the horns on his head and invaded the capital the other day you put all your hope in politics you end like these people out riding in the streets and stealing stuff from the stores they put their hopes in men and in politics in this life that's that's the the the horror of Communism is it puts all people's eggs in one basket it puts all their hope in this life all their hope in this life and then creates a horrible life but we don't have hope only in this life if God forbid this nation would become a communist Nation we would still have hope right if everything would fall around us if everybody would follow around us we'd still have hope brother the Joe why because we know that we have that promise but not only a hope we've seen it begin so when I lay someone away today I'm not just looking at what the promise was in 1 Thessalonians 4 but when he said he'll descend from heaven with a shout amen I can say he's already done it you realize how powerful that is he's already proved his word to be true oh my oh my he's he's done that as he's descending and there will come a time a sweep will go over it's a change of the body but what is it we can now we're on the other side of the open book we can say with a loud voice Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing he said and every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under the Earth and such as are in the sea and all that are in them heard I saying blessing and honor and glory and power be unto him the sth upon the throne and unto the lamb forever and ever and the four Beast said amen and the four and 20 Elders fell down and worshiped him that liveth forever and ever why what had been a prophecy now become reality listen what brother Bram says I'm closing in just a moment he said now this is the time when everything must be worshiped oh you say well you worship too much we shouldn't worship that much the word's here yes the word is here but the word brings the worship when the word is open that's why you can worship at the end of the service that's why you can you can just worship God why because the word is not just something that's being repeated from thousands of years ago but it's a living reality it's something that's manifested itself in our day and it didn't just manifest itself in a prophet but that same quickening power that manifested itself in a prophet also is manifested in our lives otherwise how can we live today we'd go with all the other denominational ages we'd slide a backslide just like the world but we live today by the life of Jesus Christ we live today because this is the hour that the book has been open and this is the time when everything must be worshiped he said he said now remember and you can say well everything is worshiped today but he said everything must be worshiped amen amen go to work and I worship I go to you go to school and you worship wherever you go everything must be worshiped he said now remember how appropriate he said now don't let us miss this now listen close when all the mysteries of the church age was finished when all the mysteries of the plans of redemption them Seven Seals was open right immediately after this now look he he said it's time for all everything in heaven and everything on Earth that includes us brother the S includes me everything in heaven and everything on Earth to worship God now watch what takes place he said listen just listen at this just a minute they sung a new song saying Thou Art Worthy listen what a worship it was the elders the Beast everything fell right before him like that when he made his complete plan amen it's time of worship now thank you Lord Psalms 30 and8 we'll go down to verse 10 I put verse eight let's go down to verse 10 he said here oh Lord and have mercy upon me Lord be thou my helper thou has turned for me my morning into dancing that's what he did for John amen thou has turned my mour into dancing thou has put off my sackcloth GED me with gladness to the end that my glory may sing praise to thee not be silent oh Lord my God I will give thanks unto thee forever this isn't a funeral for the bride this is a wedding for the bride are you with me now the wedding is going on what happens at a wedding singing and dancing and shouting and and and and and Joy on people's faces why amen say there's not shouting at a wedding go to an African wedding thou has turned for me my morning into dancing thou has put off my sackcloth GED me with gladness to the end that my glory may sing praise unto thee and not be silent oh Lord my God I will give thanks unto thee forever brother B says talk about a happy time musicians go ahead and come talk about a happy time when them seals broke John must have looked in and seen them past the curtain of time and said there is John oh he said he was so happy till he said everything in heaven brother brandom kind of makes a play on words and turns it around he said everything in heaven he must have really cried out didn't he everything in heaven everything in the earth everything beneath the Earth every creature everything else heard me saying amen blessings and glory and wisdom and power and might riches belongs to him he said why when the Revelation come that the lamb the Redeemer our Kinsman had come back from the Throne of mediatorial and had walked out here to take his possession it changes you it changes the atmosphere and you recognize the Revelation comes what I was bound to in my body I had to die this body is dust ashes to ashes and dust to dust but I'm not going to stay in that condition why because I have a revelation amen the same one that John did when he rejoiced amen what's the Revelation that the mediator has left his mediator work and walked out to take his [Music] possession church this message has made the resurrection a reality I can say when I lay my loved ones in the grave God forbid that some of you would go by way of the Grave if I would go by way of the Grave we can say not only do we hope for Resurrection someday but the process has already started even before we laid them in the ground they're coming up amen there must be some who sleep but there must also be some who will be alive and remain I want to be one of those we've seen the evidence of that we've seen the sign we've seen the sign I had some more quotes on that but I won't read them this morning but brother BR talks about how after 2,000 years we still see Jesus Christ standing what was it in the power of his resurrection he said a wicked and adulterous generation seeks after a sign but there will be no sign given to him except for the sign of the Resurrection amen and why did he show us the sign of the Resurrection in a prophet but what does that show us that we who are alive and remain we'll be the ones it's already taken place you can't stop it the devil can't stop it it's already in motion it's already rolling down the hill it's already taken place and we can be like the ones on the road to emus Their Eyes Were were holding they couldn't see Jesus and they walked with him and he he began to reveal to them the word he be to show them who he was he began to show him that Plan of Redemption all the way through the scripture and he began to talk to him and show him how how everything happened and he finally but they don't recognize it yet just dead L amen but they finally get to a place the evening time where he does something that only he can [Music] do are you realizing today do you recognize he's done that in this hour see I it's a dangerous time church because there's complacency comes because you in your mind you're saying I've heard this before but it's no less real but it's Satan that works Works through time to try to take you away try to make you complacent try to let that fire dim down in your heart oh God if there's a fire in my heart let it not be because somebody played music real fast or everybody was excited but let it be because of your word I know the book's been open for me I know I'm a part of it I know where I belong and you did something in this age that only you could do amen you did something you showed yourself through a prophet that only you could do and you came in my life and you did things that only you could do can you testify of that today you did something in my life that only you could do Lord only you could do it I know what I would be without his grace I know what I would be without his Mercy I hope you hear me this morning church I know what I would be without this message of the hour this message is not just a man this message is Jesus Christ revealed to us in this hour and he is the same yesterday today and forever the word made manifest dwelling Among Us brother Brown say how we should thank God for his great sign amen hallelujah do you believe it this morning heyen let's just talk to him a moment I can keep preaching I could keep preaching for a long time but I thank you got it this morning I think you you understand we have more than just a hope we have a reality before the open book it was different there was denominational ages but now denominational ages have ceased you're living in a different time living in a time of worship how we should thank God for this maybe your eyes have been clouded by the things of life and from this message and this this great thing that God has done in the show but you see people more and more over the years you see people get disgruntled with it and kind of back away from it not be as excited about it as they once were you preach the word and I believe the word is preached in a greater measure today cuz all these years he's been just revealing himself to us revealing himself to us we see the word preached in a greater measure today because then we have the words of a prophet we're able to study we're able to look at it the Holy Spirit speaks those words and it's preached to us not not me but but in a great measure through all of God's Ministry and yet we see ourselves falling back and falling back why because many times we let Satan Cloud our eyes our eyes are beholden but if we could just let him see only he could do it if we could just let him enter our hearts today we just invite him in and say Lord I know only you can do that in my life begin to worship God again thank him for what he's done thank God there's great sign in this day Heavenly Father Lord I pray even for myself every one of us your Prophet made a great admission at the end of his ministry even himself when he couldn't have church like he wanted to and that he didn't have a church home there in Tucson that even he himself he said we we get cold we backslide he talked about how in his own Spirit how that he gotten away from God and into that fervency not to be a sinner but just that fervency oh God you help every one of us to hunger and thirst for that today Lord may we recognize what you've done in this hour may we realize that there's a time of worship not because a preacher pumped us up into it or or a song leader or somebody else but because the book has been open we're on the we're standing on the other side of the chasm Redemption has been the process of the fullness of redemption as been completed in our hour we're so thankful for that we see Lord not only your death burial and Resurrection not only your birth but also your coming as you descend Lord the clouds and we thank you for that I pray God that you would move in our midst Lord bring a a fire in the middle of us Lord in the midst of our beings that would just consume us Lord with your word until all the little petty things would fall away we know that you were real and that only you could do that in our lives Grant it father we pray
