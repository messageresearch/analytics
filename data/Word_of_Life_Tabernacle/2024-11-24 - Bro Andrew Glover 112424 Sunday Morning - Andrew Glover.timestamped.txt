[56:44] opportunity not to be here this morning

[57:45] renewing of our minds in your word in
[57:48] Jesus Christ's name we pray and all the
[57:51] Believers says am amen and amen amen St
[57:55] John chapter 5
[57:56] in verse 21 for as the father raiseth up
[57:59] the dead and quickeneth them even so the
[58:03] son quickeneth whom he will for the
[58:06] father judgeth no man but he hath
[58:09] committed all judgment unto the son that
[58:12] all men should honor the son even as
[58:15] they honor the father now he that honth
[58:18] not the son honth not the Father which
[58:21] hath sent him now verily verily I say
[58:24] unto you he that heareth somebody say
[58:26] heareth he you know brother brandom
[58:28] translated that to understandeth he that
[58:31] heareth or understandeth my word and
[58:34] believeth on him that has sent me hath
[58:36] everlasting life and shall not come into
[58:39] condemnation listen but is passed from
[58:43] Death unto life I love what brother BR
[58:45] says he said now rub that out if you can
[58:48] amen you cannot rub that out the word of
[58:50] God for verily verily I say unto you the
[58:53] hour is coming and now is when the dead
[58:57] shall hear the voice of the Son of God
[59:00] and they that hear shall live for as the
[59:03] father now listen as the father hath
[59:06] life in himself so hath he given to the
[59:08] son to have life in himself and hath
[59:11] given him authority to execute judgment
[59:14] also listen because he is the son of man
[59:19] not will be or was he is the son of man
[59:23] now Marvel not at this for the hour is
[59:25] coming
[59:26] that which all that are in the graves
[59:28] shall hear his voice and shall come
[59:31] forth they that have done good unto the
[59:33] resurrection of life and they that had
[59:35] done evil unto the resurrection of
[59:38] damnation now I want to turn to
[59:40] Revelations chapter 10 Revelation uh
[59:43] chapter 10 and I I know tonight or this
[59:46] morning rather that we could read this
[59:47] verse from heart in Revelations chapter
[59:50] 10 and in verse number 7 Revelations 10
[59:54] and verse number 7 but in the days of
[59:57] the voice of the seventh angel when he
[1:00:00] shall begin to sound the mystery of God
[1:00:03] should be finished can I say when he
[1:00:05] shall begin to speak as he hath declared
[1:00:08] unto his servants the prophets now one
[1:00:11] of place I want to look is back in the
[1:00:13] New Testament in St Luke St Luke chapter
[1:00:17] 17 you love the Lord this morning amen
[1:00:20] St Luke chapter 17 and another very very
[1:00:24] familiar reading
[1:00:27] St Luke chapter
[1:00:30] 17 we want to look in the the 30th verse
[1:00:35] St Luke 17 and verse
[1:00:37] 30 even thus shall it be in the day when
[1:00:42] the son of man is revealed we ask the
[1:00:45] Lord this morning to bless the reading
[1:00:46] of his word as you can have your seats
[1:00:47] today I want to by the help of the Lord
[1:00:49] for a few moments this morning if I
[1:00:52] would take a title today I want to talk
[1:00:54] to you on this obey the voice of the son
[1:00:57] of man obey the voice of the son of man
[1:01:01] uh in 1956 in a sermon called Faith
[1:01:04] priest in Charlotte North Carolina
[1:01:06] brother BR says now I'm going to ask you
[1:01:08] all to be reverent just as reverent as
[1:01:10] you can you say brother brandom what are
[1:01:12] you talking about see you're just
[1:01:14] stalling he said well I am exactly he
[1:01:17] said I am waiting for that angel of the
[1:01:19] Lord to come amen I am waiting for that
[1:01:22] angel of the Lord to come that's exactly
[1:01:25] right see I don't know none of you and
[1:01:27] how could I do anything I can't it's him
[1:01:30] I can't do it even when he comes unless
[1:01:33] your faith operates it it's not me he
[1:01:37] said I Can See Vision I cannot see
[1:01:39] Visions unless it's your faith amen that
[1:01:41] does it sure he said God's Will by
[1:01:44] Divine gift the only thing I do is just
[1:01:48] keep yielding myself and as I get myself
[1:01:51] completely yielded to the Holy Spirit
[1:01:54] then he starts talking amen the only
[1:01:57] thing I can do is get myself completely
[1:01:59] yielded to the Holy Spirit then he
[1:02:02] starts talking he said it's not me amen
[1:02:06] he is using my voice amen he is using my
[1:02:10] voice but it's not me it's him see
[1:02:13] that's exactly amen what the scripture
[1:02:16] said I wonder this morning how many
[1:02:18] could declare that you believe that God
[1:02:20] can speak anden you believe with all of
[1:02:23] your heart that God is able Amen to
[1:02:25] speak brother said if you can hear a
[1:02:27] voice amen speaking to you that's God
[1:02:31] Amen because it copes with the scripture
[1:02:34] he said if it doesn't then there's some
[1:02:36] kind of a wrong voice amen that's
[1:02:38] speaking to you but the right voice amen
[1:02:41] will tell you to follow the rules of the
[1:02:44] Bible he said there's no sprinkling
[1:02:46] there's no pouring no falsely amen come
[1:02:49] right straight out amen and follow the
[1:02:52] rules of the Bible so this is a voice
[1:02:56] amen that is calling you out of
[1:02:58] something amen but it's also bringing
[1:03:00] you to something so it's not just
[1:03:02] calling you out Amen to leave you in
[1:03:04] limbo so to speak but it's calling you
[1:03:06] out Amen to bring you into something and
[1:03:09] that is amen into the rules or the
[1:03:12] instructions of the word of God I
[1:03:15] believe that God Amen has spokesmen that
[1:03:17] he raises up in every age and I don't
[1:03:20] believe that those spokesmen come Amen
[1:03:22] on their own accord or on their own
[1:03:24] ability amen but rather I believe God
[1:03:26] sends his spokesman Amen to speak on his
[1:03:30] behalf in Hebrews 12 and verse 25 Paul
[1:03:33] said amen see that ye refuse not him
[1:03:37] that speaketh for if they escape not who
[1:03:40] refused him that spake on Earth amen
[1:03:43] then how much more shall not we escape
[1:03:46] amen if we turn away from him that
[1:03:48] speaketh from Heaven amen now watch if
[1:03:51] we turn away from him amen that speaketh
[1:03:54] from heaven when you look here amen if
[1:03:56] this word speaketh it means to
[1:03:58] articulate sounds it means to declare
[1:04:01] one's mind amen by speech or by sound
[1:04:04] now when you think about this word sound
[1:04:06] how many knows that there's actually two
[1:04:08] types of sounds brother identifies them
[1:04:11] he said one is a certain sound he said
[1:04:13] and the other is an uncertain sound in 1
[1:04:16] Corinthians 14:8 Paul says amen if the
[1:04:19] trumpet give an uncertain sound amen
[1:04:22] then who shall prepare himself to the
[1:04:25] battle in Revelation chap 1 and verse 10
[1:04:27] again John says I was in the spirit amen
[1:04:30] on the Lord's day amen and I heard
[1:04:33] behind me a great voice as of a trumpet
[1:04:37] amen if a trumpet give an uncertain
[1:04:39] sound amen then who shall prepare
[1:04:42] himself for the battle amen now watch
[1:04:44] and and look and I was in the spirit on
[1:04:46] the Lord's day and I heard behind me a
[1:04:49] great voice as of a trumpet now in the
[1:04:51] seven Church ages 54 brother said a
[1:04:54] trumpet amen is an announcement he said
[1:04:57] Gable at the coming of the Lord shall
[1:04:59] sound the Trump of God he said this was
[1:05:02] God's trumpet blowing in other words
[1:05:04] he's fixing to announce amen the Eternal
[1:05:07] destination of the world so when you
[1:05:10] hear a trumpet amen it is an
[1:05:12] announcement or a voice amen that is
[1:05:15] getting ready to announce the etern oh
[1:05:17] my announce the Eternal destination of
[1:05:21] the world he said now a trumpet what is
[1:05:23] it amen get ready I'm going going to
[1:05:26] give you amen the revelation of Jesus
[1:05:29] Christ to give to the church he said I
[1:05:31] will speak to you amen and what will be
[1:05:34] the destination of the world Amen is for
[1:05:37] those who receive amen and those who
[1:05:40] reject amen so your attitude towards the
[1:05:43] Revelation that is coming amen from the

[1:09:30] shout the word he said the word was
[1:09:33] almost entirely lost to the people he
[1:09:36] said but God sent Luther with a word he
[1:09:38] said then God sent Wesley amen and he
[1:09:41] was the voice with the word in his day
[1:09:43] he said and the people who took his
[1:09:45] Revelation from God Amen became the
[1:09:48] living Epistles amen they were read and
[1:09:51] known of all men for their generation
[1:09:53] and when the Methodist failed God raised
[1:09:55] up others amen and so it has gone on

[1:10:04] land who under their messenger amen will
[1:10:07] be the final voice Amen to the final age

[1:12:07] and provoke him not for he will not
[1:12:09] pardon your transgressions amen look for
[1:12:12] my name is in him but if Thou shalt

[1:12:29] God to become your enemy's enemy and
[1:12:32] what caused God to become your
[1:12:33] adversary's adversary I'll tell you what
[1:12:36] done it was when you receive the angel
[1:12:39] when you believe the angel but when you
[1:12:41] obey the angel he said for my angel
[1:12:43] shall go before thee and he will bring
[1:12:46] thee into the amorites and the Hittites
[1:12:48] and the parasites and the Canaanites and

[1:13:22] blessing amen upon the children of God
[1:13:25] was not just receiving the angel or

[1:14:08] sir Hallelujah now you know the Bible
[1:14:11] said amen that to behold Amen to obey is
[1:14:14] better than sacrifice amen I met some
[1:14:17] people that if they had learned that
[1:14:18] they could go long way with God on well
[1:14:21] we might as well preach it Sunday
[1:14:23] morning amen to obey is better than
[1:14:26] sacrifice and then they get so spiritual
[1:14:28] they forget they got to obey the word of
[1:14:30] God obedience is very important amen
[1:14:33] obedience is the best amen and we know
[1:14:36] what obedience does obedience unlocks
[1:14:39] amen the supernatural I love in Genesis
[1:14:42] 22:15 it says the angel of the Lord amen
[1:14:45] he called un Abraham out of the heaven
[1:14:47] the second time you know what he said he
[1:14:50] said by myself have I sworn amen saith

[1:15:16] amen the gates of his enemy so in other
[1:15:19] words Brother David The Obedience amen
[1:15:21] did not just unlock the blessing of God
[1:15:24] Amen upon the parents but it unlocked
[1:15:27] the blessing of God upon the seed oh

[1:15:54] Isaac he was was looking for Abraham's
[1:15:56] obedience Amen to the voice that was
[1:15:58] speaking to him what are you saying I'm

[1:16:14] Generations ahead of you amen but the
[1:16:17] very minute you crisscross or you delute
[1:16:20] what a prophet said about a situation is
[1:16:22] the very minute you will lock the
[1:16:24] blessings of
[1:16:25] god well we might as well preach it
[1:16:28] Sunday morning amen let's just go to a
[1:16:30] basic one amen forsake not the
[1:16:32] assembling of yourselves together listen
[1:16:35] that is not brother bram's voice that is
[1:16:37] the voice of God but he sent a prophet
[1:16:40] in this generation to reveal to the
[1:16:42] church at every time amen that the
[1:16:44] church doors are open if you got God in
[1:16:47] your hearts you can't wait to get in
[1:16:49] there and to fellowship with your
[1:16:51] brothers and your sisters now yall know
[1:16:54] it's an age leot to see and lukewarmness
[1:16:56] amen we're going to church has become
[1:16:58] optional you know if we can make it
[1:17:00] we'll be there if we can't we won't amen
[1:17:02] we'll stream we'll get a used to be get
[1:17:05] the tape but now we just get the stream
[1:17:06] and and and oh God I'm out just go ahead
[1:17:09] and preach amen and people was more
[1:17:11] faithful when they got the tape out of
[1:17:12] the library than half of them are now
[1:17:14] with it on their cell phone you know why
[1:17:16] because it's a layo ofy in lukor spirit
[1:17:19] amen that wants to conquer the fire of
[1:17:21] God Amen that is burning in the church
[1:17:24] right
[1:17:25] I think of it sometimes how y'all y'all
[1:17:28] know brother Jonathan Martin out here
[1:17:30] Amen brother Wendell and Chan's brother
[1:17:32] brother Jonathan's father-in-law brother
[1:17:33] ml Apple y'all know brother Merl Amen
[1:17:35] brother Merl years ago they come out of
[1:17:37] a false Doctrine situation I hope it's
[1:17:39] okay to share this it's a powerful
[1:17:41] testimony they come out of a bad
[1:17:43] situation and brother Merl had three
[1:17:45] girls and a son and he said you know he
[1:17:47] told me this one time he said brother
[1:17:48] the Andrew he said we were living about
[1:17:50] 2 hours away from church he said now we
[1:17:52] went every service I I said every
[1:17:55] service he said every service I said
[1:17:57] even on Wednesdays he said yeah we went
[1:18:00] on Wednesdays he said I had to get up at
[1:18:02] 3: or 4:00 in the morning and go to work
[1:18:04] he said but we would drive two hours
[1:18:06] there he said we would drive two hours
[1:18:08] back he said I would sleep on the way
[1:18:10] back get up when I got home and go to
[1:18:12] work I thought my goodness amen but then
[1:18:15] it just dawned on me amen all those
[1:18:18] years of sacrifice amen all those years
[1:18:20] it wasn't easy but what he was doing was
[1:18:23] he was obeying the word of God
[1:18:25] and today years later amen he is reaping
[1:18:28] the benefits amen of the obedience to
[1:18:30] the word of God he's got three daughters
[1:18:33] and they're all married to preachers
[1:18:35] amen he's got grandbabies in the house
[1:18:37] of God Amen that they they lost their
[1:18:39] son a few years ago in a tragic accident
[1:18:42] but he's waiting on the shores of Glory
[1:18:44] I just got to thinking about that amen
[1:18:46] and all because he simply obeyed amen
[1:18:49] the voice of the son of man when he said
[1:18:51] forsake not the assembling of yourselves
[1:18:54] together listen Abraham until he fully
[1:18:57] obeyed God Amen the blessing never come
[1:19:00] until he fully obeyed God Amen and when
[1:19:03] he come to full obedience amen then God
[1:19:06] brought the full blessing amen full
[1:19:08] obedience will bring amen the full
[1:19:11] blessing I'll say this amen God is not
[1:19:13] interested in your education he is not
[1:19:16] interested in how spiritual you are or
[1:19:18] how much you think you know amen God is
[1:19:21] interested in our obedience and when God
[1:19:24] God sends a prophet amen he sends him to
[1:19:27] say things listen that sometimes he
[1:19:29] don't even want to say he said listen
[1:19:32] whether they liked it or not whether
[1:19:33] they crucified him whether they stoned
[1:19:35] him whatever they did amen God had
[1:19:38] spoken his heart and he must say it
[1:19:41] listen not to be different amen but to
[1:19:44] be obedient when God sent a prophet he
[1:19:47] said see he had so much complete control
[1:19:50] of him till he was their voice he said
[1:19:54] oh give me a church that's so completely
[1:19:57] Anointed with God Amen till their very a
[1:20:00] action every move is thus sayith the
[1:20:02] Lord amen they will walk in that the
[1:20:04] kind of Glory he said I will show you a
[1:20:07] messiah which is an anointed one of God
[1:20:10] Amen look standing upon the Earth amen
[1:20:14] will you remember that amen not sitting
[1:20:17] upon the Earth amen but standing upon
[1:20:20] the Earth you say what is the Messiah
[1:20:23] amen the Messiah was was the word amen
[1:20:26] in its fullness let me just say this the
[1:20:28] signs of God Amen are always overlooked
[1:20:32] said one of God's signs amen is the
[1:20:35] coming of a prophet he said and they
[1:20:37] Overlook it every time he said but those
[1:20:40] who are elected to see it amen they do
[1:20:43] see it he said but the coming of a
[1:20:45] prophet amen was the sign amen that God
[1:20:49] is ready to speak cuz if God ain't going
[1:20:52] to speak amen the prophet wouldn't be on
[1:20:55] the earth come on come on church if God
[1:20:59] wasn't ready to speak amen the prophet
[1:21:02] wouldn't be on the earth he said now
[1:21:03] remember that he wouldn't be on the
[1:21:05] earth unless God was ready to speak so
[1:21:08] we find then that there is a sign amen
[1:21:11] and there is a voice brother said the
[1:21:13] sign is given to an audience Amen to
[1:21:16] hear the voice he said he wants an
[1:21:19] audience he wants somebody that's going
[1:21:22] to listen to what he is going to say the
[1:21:25] sign is an alert it is to attract the
[1:21:28] attention of the people listen that the
[1:21:31] word is getting ready to speak amen
[1:21:34] listen when you see the sign amen the
[1:21:37] sign is not the attraction amen that we
[1:21:39] are to focus on Amen the sign is the
[1:21:42] attention getter but the voice is the
[1:21:45] focus of the age oh Church of the Living
[1:21:48] God many will see the sign but only
[1:21:51] elected amen will hear the voice what
[1:21:54] are you saying the voice is amen the
[1:21:57] voice is the word and just as Abraham
[1:22:00] was elected Amen to hear the voice amen
[1:22:03] there is a bride on the Earth today who
[1:22:06] is elected to open up their mind and let
[1:22:09] the word come in amen and forsake all
[1:22:12] five outer senses amen forsake all five
[1:22:15] inner senses amen and March with the
[1:22:19] word hallelujah the word is calling you
[1:22:23] come on come on Church the word is
[1:22:25] calling you to march with the word I
[1:22:28] love this brother said the principle
[1:22:30] amen of obedience paraphrasing now
[1:22:32] listen let me just say say this y'all
[1:22:34] remember at the wedding when Jesus was
[1:22:36] there and they were having a wedding
[1:22:38] feast and brother Joe they got about
[1:22:39] halfway through it and all of a sudden
[1:22:41] they ran out of wine you know and they
[1:22:43] said man we need some wine ain't nowhere
[1:22:45] to go get none anden so what they done
[1:22:47] was they took some water in a pot and
[1:22:49] brother Jeff they brought it over there
[1:22:51] and they set it down before the Lord
[1:22:52] Jesus and many of them just looked at it
[1:22:55] and they said well all it is is water
[1:22:57] but in St John Chapter 2 and verse 5 the
[1:23:00] Bible says his mother spoke up and said
[1:23:02] un the servant whatsoever he saith unto
[1:23:05] you amen do
[1:23:07] it whatever he saith unto you amen just
[1:23:12] do it brother said that's still amen
[1:23:14] good teaching tonight whatever he saith
[1:23:17] unto you just do it if he tells you to
[1:23:19] make ready for death amen then you get
[1:23:22] ready if he tells you you're going to
[1:23:24] get well amen then you believe it if he
[1:23:27] tells you you're healed then you are
[1:23:29] whatever he says amen you just do it to
[1:23:32] disbelieve it it is a sin so when God
[1:23:36] gives instruction amen he does not give
[1:23:39] those as suggestions amen but he gives
[1:23:41] those as instructions to be followed I
[1:23:44] love this in 1 Corinthians 15:3 Paul
[1:23:47] says amen I delivered unto you first of
[1:23:49] all that which also received how that
[1:23:51] Christ died for our sins amen according
[1:23:54] to the scripture you know what that word
[1:23:56] delivered means it means to deliver
[1:23:59] something verbally now listen friends to
[1:24:01] deliver something verbally I love what
[1:24:03] the prod of God says in the very first

[1:28:08] a tape and write you 10 things down from
[1:28:10] that tape and go to the pull pit and say
[1:28:12] it and I promise you that the same angel
[1:28:15] of God that anointed a prophet to say it
[1:28:17] will show up on the pulpit when you read
[1:28:19] it and he will back it with the same
[1:28:22] anointing anden it ain't a poking
[1:28:24] religion it's obedience to the word of
[1:28:27] God yes sir I know I know it might get a
[1:28:30] little touch touchy there but it's the
[1:28:31] truth

[1:28:58] God and they get the spiritual poking
[1:29:01] poking come on Bible don't say poke the
[1:29:03] word it says preach the word the only
[1:29:06] thing the messenger can I'm GNA move on
[1:29:08] the only thing the messenger can do is
[1:29:09] deliver the message he said now listen
[1:29:12] if God sent the messenger and Vindicated
[1:29:14] by the signs that he was the messenger
[1:29:17] sent from God then it's up to them to
[1:29:19] obey their messenger listen exactly they
[1:29:22] must obey the messenger and have
[1:29:25] respects to that messenger in Exodus 12
[1:29:28] I I just know sometimes people get to
[1:29:30] thinking well uh God requires a lot out
[1:29:32] of us well let's look here in Exodus 12
[1:29:34] and verse
[1:29:35] one the Bible says when God gives Moses
[1:29:38] the instructions of applying the token
[1:29:40] the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron in
[1:29:42] the land of Egypt saying this month
[1:29:44] shall be unto you the beginning of
[1:29:45] months it shall be the first month of
[1:29:47] the year to you now speak ye to all the
[1:29:50] congregation of Israel and say in the
[1:29:52] 10th day of this month shall they take
[1:29:54] to every man a lamb according to the
[1:29:57] house of their fathers amen a lamb for a
[1:29:59] house and if the household be too little
[1:30:01] for the lamb then let him and his
[1:30:03] neighbor next unto his house take it
[1:30:05] according to the number of the souls
[1:30:07] every man according to his eating amen
[1:30:10] shall make your account amen for the
[1:30:12] lamb listen your lamb shall be without
[1:30:15] blemish it shall be a male of the first
[1:30:17] year you shall take it out from the
[1:30:19] sheep or from the goats and you shall
[1:30:21] keep it up until the 14th day of the
[1:30:24] month and the whole assembly of the
[1:30:26] congregation of Israel amen shall kill
[1:30:28] it in the evening and they shall take of
[1:30:30] the blood and strike it on the two side
[1:30:32] post on the upper door post of the
[1:30:34] houses wherein they shall eat it and
[1:30:37] they shall eat the Flesh in the night
[1:30:39] they shall roast it with fire and un
[1:30:41] leaven bread and with bitter herbs they
[1:30:43] shall eat it eat not of it raw nor Soden
[1:30:45] it all with water but roast it with fire
[1:30:48] his head with his legs and with the bur
[1:30:49] thereof and you shall let nothing of it
[1:30:52] remain until the morning and that which
[1:30:54] remaineth amen it shall be look here and
[1:30:56] that which remaineth into the morning
[1:30:58] that which remaineth shall be burned
[1:31:00] with fire and thus shall you eat it now
[1:31:02] look how not only is he going to tell
[1:31:04] you how to get it when to cook it how to
[1:31:06] prepare it how to apply the blood of it
[1:31:08] he's even going to tell you how to eat
[1:31:09] it he says eat it with your loins girded
[1:31:12] your shoes on your feet and your staff
[1:31:14] in your hand and you shall eat it in
[1:31:16] haste for it is the Lord's Passover for
[1:31:20] I will pass through the land of Egypt
[1:31:21] this night and will Smite all the the
[1:31:24] firstborn in the land of Egypt both man
[1:31:26] and Beast and against all the gods of
[1:31:29] Egypt I will execute judgment amen I am
[1:31:32] the Lord and the blood shall be to you
[1:31:34] for a token upon the house where you are
[1:31:37] and when I see the blood amen I will
[1:31:41] pass over you and the plague shall not
[1:31:43] be upon you to destroy you amen when I
[1:31:46] smite amen the land of Egypt is it not
[1:31:49] amazing brother Joel that the Bible
[1:31:51] don't just say go get your lamb and amen
[1:31:54] slay it and slap some blood above the
[1:31:55] door amen but God gives instructions
[1:31:58] Amen on how to eat it amen where to get
[1:32:01] it from amen how to prepare it how to
[1:32:04] apply the blood when to apply can I say
[1:32:07] this amen the evidence of obedience amen
[1:32:09] was not quoting what Moses said amen but
[1:32:12] it was applying the blood amen just as
[1:32:16] Moses said in other words if Moses would
[1:32:19] have delivered the instructions and a
[1:32:21] father would have said you know what I
[1:32:23] don't think all that really matters I'll
[1:32:25] just go get me a lamb it don't matter if
[1:32:27] it's got a blemish or not I'll just slap
[1:32:29] some blood above the door and we'll just
[1:32:31] go on as we are you know what would have
[1:32:33] happened amen the death angel would have
[1:32:36] destroyed the firstborn amen but because
[1:32:38] there was a spirit of obedience amen the
[1:32:41] father said we're not going to cut
[1:32:43] corners on anything Moses said listen
[1:32:46] obedience brought the Covenant of the
[1:32:48] token into effect if the token wasn't
[1:32:52] displayed according to the the Covenant
[1:32:54] then the Covenant was not effective he
[1:32:57] said see you say oh I believe and you
[1:32:59] don't follow the instructions of the
[1:33:01] word then you don't believe see amen you
[1:33:04] be circumcised you joined something
[1:33:06] you're baptized amen done all those
[1:33:08] things amen that still ain't the token
[1:33:11] the Holy Ghost let me say this obeying
[1:33:14] the messenger is more than just quoting
[1:33:16] the messenger obeying the messenger is
[1:33:19] more than just memorizing the
[1:33:20] instructions that have been delivered by
[1:33:23] the messenger but when you obey the
[1:33:25] messenger is when you take the message
[1:33:27] into your heart remember said don't you
[1:33:29] just come this far and say I believe the
[1:33:32] message no you obey the messenger and
[1:33:35] you come into Christ you say well I
[1:33:38] believe every word brother brandom
[1:33:40] that's good but that's just being able
[1:33:42] to read he said you take the message you
[1:33:45] take it into your heart that you must
[1:33:47] have the token amen the very life that
[1:33:50] was in Christ amen be in you you say
[1:33:53] what is the message the message is
[1:33:56] Christ which is the anointed word can I
[1:33:59] just go ahead and preach here for a
[1:34:00] second amen the message is not a better
[1:34:04] thought the message of the hour amen is
[1:34:07] not a better thought I'll say this the
[1:34:09] message is the only thought people say
[1:34:12] well I don't think that matters Moses
[1:34:14] didn't say Amen I've got a better
[1:34:16] thought about the applying of the blood
[1:34:18] amen and change the instruction of the
[1:34:20] applying the blood and neither did Noah
[1:34:22] when he built the ark amen if Noah would
[1:34:24] have changed one instruction on that Ark
[1:34:27] it would have went to the Bottom of the
[1:34:30] Sea are are you with me now you know
[1:34:33] what obedience causes you to do
[1:34:35] obedience causes you to surrender your
[1:34:39] own
[1:34:40] thoughts oh my when you really obey
[1:34:43] something you surrender your own
[1:34:46] thoughts in second Corinthians chapter
[1:34:47] 10: 5 the Bible says casting down
[1:34:51] imagination and every High thing that
[1:34:54] exalteth itself against the knowledge of
[1:34:56] God and bringing into captivity every
[1:34:59] thought Amen to The Obedience of Christ
[1:35:02] amen I got to thinking about something
[1:35:03] the other day amen there's a way to fix
[1:35:05] a lot of problems around a church is
[1:35:07] when you get rid of the carnal mind and
[1:35:09] you get a spiritual mind anden if you
[1:35:11] got a carnal mind you see things
[1:35:14] carnally you filter things carnally you
[1:35:17] believe things carnally you look at
[1:35:19] every situation from the carnal side but
[1:35:21] if you if you lay aside
[1:35:24] amen the carnal mind and receive the
[1:35:26] mind of Christ it will cause you Amen to
[1:35:30] see things the way God sees things
[1:35:33] come now come on we might as well preach
[1:35:36] amen cuz people get one-sided on things
[1:35:39] and they just see this and see this and
[1:35:40] see this amen but I'll tell you what
[1:35:42] your imagination will do your
[1:35:43] imagination will bind you up your
[1:35:46] imagination will put you in a dark place
[1:35:48] your imagination will lock amen the
[1:35:51] blessings of God over your home your
[1:35:53] imag ation will lock the blessings of
[1:35:55] God between you and a brother between
[1:35:57] you and a sister come on church amen
[1:35:59] I've seen it I amen I may just be 28
[1:36:02] years old but I've been around a few
[1:36:03] days and I've seen people in churches
[1:36:05] amen start imagining things about the
[1:36:08] pastor or about the musicians or about
[1:36:11] the song leader or about the Deacon and
[1:36:13] before long their imaginations become
[1:36:15] reality amen and the only thing it was
[1:36:18] was a devil amen that got on them maybe
[1:36:20] in the form of a religious spirit amen
[1:36:23] and B them in that prison of imagination
[1:36:25] you know what I say I say it's time Amen

[1:42:12] real to you but the only are you hearing
[1:42:14] me now but the only one that has the
[1:42:16] ability to make it real is the devil
[1:42:19] that's right the only one that has the
[1:42:22] ability to make that imagination a
[1:42:24] reality is the devil what are you saying
[1:42:28] I'm saying God has chosen to reveal
[1:42:30] himself not to imagine himself to
[1:42:34] you God is Not imagining himself to you
[1:42:37] God is revealing himself the Bible says
[1:42:40] this he would reveal himself in three
[1:42:42] ways brother picks it up he said first
[1:42:44] time he revealed himself in a pillar of
[1:42:46] fire that was called the fatherhood then
[1:42:48] the same God made manifest in Jesus
[1:42:50] Christ which he built a body made this
[1:42:52] body
[1:42:53] he said but then thirdly amen through
[1:42:56] death that body he Sanctified a church
[1:42:59] that he can dwell in so it was God above
[1:43:02] us it was God With Us amen and it's God
[1:43:05] in us the same God let me say this God
[1:43:08] reveals himself in three ways God also
[1:43:11] reveals himself in three sons names he
[1:43:15] comes as the son of man which is a
[1:43:17] prophet he comes as the Son of God
[1:43:19] through the church ages he comes as the
[1:43:22] son of David in the millenum but between
[1:43:24] the second coming of our Lord and the
[1:43:26] lean Church age he prophesied he would
[1:43:30] come again as the son of man he said see
[1:43:33] watch he comes as son of man to fulfill
[1:43:35] the scripture but now he is to the
[1:43:37] church age he has been Son of God in the
[1:43:40] Millennium he'll be the son of David but
[1:43:43] between this time he is to reveal
[1:43:45] himself again amen as son of man a
[1:43:48] prophet amen now listen to this he said
[1:43:50] look because the word of the Lord comes
[1:43:53] to the prophets only yeah come on never
[1:43:57] to theologians it is to prophets and the
[1:44:00] Lord said he done nothing in his
[1:44:02] unchanging word he said we just talked
[1:44:04] about it at the end time then the Seven
[1:44:07] Seals that this Bible is sealed up the
[1:44:09] Sevenfold mysteries of all of Christ has
[1:44:12] to be revealed first and it can only be
[1:44:14] brought by a prophet so Jesus said amen
[1:44:18] that it shall be in the day when the son
[1:44:21] of man is revealed remember said what is
[1:44:23] revealed it is a secret made known a
[1:44:27] revelation is to reveal or make known a
[1:44:30] secret so there's something brother Jeff
[1:44:32] that's so powerful about this secret
[1:44:35] that when it's made known it's going to
[1:44:37] enable the church in the voice of the
[1:44:39] sign 1964 he said the son of man is
[1:44:42] prophesied to be revealed and what kind
[1:44:45] of a revelation will it be it'll be the
[1:44:47] revelation of his living after being
[1:44:50] crucified for 19900 years but but he is
[1:44:53] raised from the dead and is alive with
[1:44:56] us and he will be revealed can I say

[1:47:09] about myself being that I was packing
[1:47:12] the message I have no more to do with it

[1:47:17] voice my voice even against my better
[1:47:19] judgment amen I wanted to be a Trapper
[1:47:22] but it's the will of my father that I
[1:47:24] declared to do I wasn't the one that
[1:47:27] appeared on the river I was only
[1:47:29] standing there when he appeared I'm not
[1:47:32] the one that performs these things and
[1:47:34] foretells these things as perfect as
[1:47:36] they are I'm only the one that's near
[1:47:39] when he does it are y'all ready for this
[1:47:41] I was only a voice that he used to say
[1:47:45] it it wasn't what I knew it's what I
[1:47:48] surrendered myself to that he spoke
[1:47:51] through it is isn't me it wasn't the
[1:47:54] seventh angel oh no it was the
[1:47:57] manifestation of the son of man Glory it
[1:48:02] wasn't the angel his message it was the
[1:48:05] mystery that God unfolded it's not a man
[1:48:08] it's God he said the angel was not the
[1:48:11] son of man he was the messenger from the
[1:48:14] son of man what are you saying preacher
[1:48:16] I'm saying the seventh angel is only the
[1:48:19] mouthpiece amen or the voice of the son
[1:48:22] of man therefore FRS is your brother
[1:48:24] that's all I am amen but God Amen God's
[1:48:28] gift is the spirit of God that come down
[1:48:31] in the form of an angel now he didn't
[1:48:34] have wings he looked like a man I heard
[1:48:37] him when he walked he said just as that
[1:48:39] walked on the floor walked right over
[1:48:41] just amen as normal as any man talks
[1:48:43] like any man he come time after time
[1:48:46] through the room and different places
[1:48:48] when I'm fasting and praying now
[1:48:50] tomorrow night he said I want to speak a
[1:48:51] little bit about this he said but when
[1:48:53] he comes it's different then hallelujah
[1:48:56] when he comes it's different then now
[1:49:00] he's here tonight to minister to you
[1:49:02] people I'm only his
[1:49:06] mouthpiece I'm only his mouthpiece what
[1:49:10] is a prophet amen a prophet is a mute
[1:49:13] until it speaks something but what I do
[1:49:16] is just yield myself to his Spirit
[1:49:19] listen and he speaks through it it
[1:49:21] cannot speak it's s are you with me it
[1:49:24] cannot speak itself look here the woman
[1:49:27] stands about 10 or 12T from me listen to
[1:49:30] this I'm just looking at her to talk to
[1:49:32] her cuz after preaching and so forth
[1:49:34] like the prophet did down there and I'm
[1:49:35] not a prophet but as the prophet did
[1:49:38] down there he had been balling that
[1:49:40] Gerome out and there so he just had to
[1:49:42] play and talk and Jesus talked to the
[1:49:45] woman but first he had to contact her
[1:49:47] spirit until he got
[1:49:50] anointed come on so it was the anointing
[1:49:53] that brought the angel of the Lord upon
[1:49:55] him that's right he said that's what I'm
[1:49:58] waiting for now are y'all ready for this
[1:50:01] to get the log of William brandom out of
[1:50:03] the
[1:50:06] way come on all right the
[1:50:10] log the log come on of William brandom
[1:50:14] come on now get my intellects my spirit
[1:50:17] my knowing whatever and I get that all
[1:50:19] out of the way so he can use use my
[1:50:24] eyes and my lips to glorify himself
[1:50:29] before his people can I say this to you
[1:50:33] if you fail to receive if you fail to
[1:50:36] believe if you fail to obey the
[1:50:40] messenger B said look he said you could
[1:50:42] be a renowned Christian or whatever and
[1:50:45] fail to believe what I've told you to be
[1:50:46] the truth listen you would never be able
[1:50:49] to reap a benefit from it he said I'm
[1:50:51] sorry to say that but it's the truth so
[1:50:53] when you receive and believe and Obey
[1:50:57] listen then it becomes and I'm tying
[1:50:59] this together then it becomes a voice of
[1:51:02] God to you yeah so it's no longer just a
[1:51:05] voice to Abraham or a voice to Moses or
[1:51:08] a voice to Noah it becomes a voice of
[1:51:12] God to you he said how did mup sha I
[1:51:14] never seen him in my life I know nothing
[1:51:16] of him how I know he was a congressman
[1:51:19] and who he was but the holy the Holy
[1:51:22] Spirit re it here at the platform see he
[1:51:25] revealed it amen makes his Secrets known
[1:51:28] now that's nothing to do with me see it
[1:51:30] just happened to be I was born for that
[1:51:32] purpose look I'm just your brother by
[1:51:35] the grace of God but when the angel of
[1:51:37] the Lord moves down it becomes then a
[1:51:41] voice of God to you if I offended you by
[1:51:44] saying that forgive me but I felt I felt
[1:51:46] it might have been resented amen but I
[1:51:49] am God's voice to you come on Church I
[1:51:52] am God's voice to you see I say that
[1:51:55] again that time was under inspiration
[1:51:58] see and I felt bad about it the first
[1:52:00] time amen but it repeated it so the
[1:52:04] first time he said it there was still a
[1:52:06] log of William brandom in the way that
[1:52:09] caused him to feel bad about saying I'm
[1:52:12] God's mouthpiece to you but in the
[1:52:14] matter of seconds because he was waiting
[1:52:17] on the angel of God the anointing which
[1:52:20] destroys the Yoke of the enemy in just a
[1:52:23] few seconds oh Church of the Living God
[1:52:26] Amen it wasn't a whole service later it
[1:52:28] wasn't a whole campaign later it was
[1:52:30] just a few seconds and William brandom's
[1:52:32] law got out of the way he got out of the
[1:52:35] way to believe that he was God's mouth
[1:52:38] what do you say it I'm saying church
[1:52:40] right now are you with me right now and
[1:52:43] then you're sitting there and the
[1:52:44] devil's trying to put something between
[1:52:46] you but something between your brother
[1:52:48] but something between you and the
[1:52:50] preacher but something between you and
[1:52:51] me or you and your husband or you and
[1:52:53] your wife are you with me amen and what
[1:52:55] he's trying to do is he's trying to
[1:52:57] block amen the blessing of God from
[1:52:59] coming into your heart but if you can so
[1:53:02] surrender to
[1:53:04] God if you can so surrender right now if
[1:53:08] you can say God I've been wrong God I'm
[1:53:11] sorry God I got out of line God I
[1:53:13] disobeyed God I got too much of my old
[1:53:16] human my old stinking sorry rotten human
[1:53:19] ability and knowledge and flesh in the
[1:53:21] way but right now God I want it to go I
[1:53:24] want my ambitions to go I want my
[1:53:27] selfishness to go I want that old
[1:53:29] religious spirit to

[1:54:00] power to forgive and heal remember that
[1:54:03] you know what else the Bible said the
[1:54:05] Bible said there was a man laying there
[1:54:06] with py in a bed and Jesus saw his
[1:54:09] friend's faith and said man thy sins are
[1:54:13] forgiven thee in St Luke 5 and: 24 but
[1:54:16] that you may know that the son of man
[1:54:18] hath power upon Earth to forgive sins
[1:54:22] he said in the sick and py I say unto
[1:54:26] thee sit there and keep watered in your
[1:54:29] condition and keep going over the

[1:54:53] own house glorifying God and they were
[1:54:56] all amazed and they all glorified God
