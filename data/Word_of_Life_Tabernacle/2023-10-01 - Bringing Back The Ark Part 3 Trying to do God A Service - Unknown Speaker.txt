Lord I feel this morning like Moses when he stood before the people he said Lord you brought us up this far Lord of your presence doesn't go with us then we don't want to go he said my presence shall go with you Lord I'm so grateful for that promise today Lord we thank you for your spirit that we feel here this morning thank you for the the your presence we know is here because you said it would be here it's your promise Lord we're holding you to that promise today Lord I I don't know what's on the needs of every heart but you do Lord I know there's a sincere need behind every hand I pray you'd meet that need this morning Lord that we would not be the same or when we leave here that somehow the word can change us we would go through that little room oh God come out the other side maybe not even realize what happened or or how we were touched but somehow Lord we were changed or because one day we know when we get through this this room lord of the word Lord one day when our tests and trials are over we're going to come out on the other side in a new body we're so grateful for that Lord oh help us to help us to persevere o God help us to fight the battle until then forgive us of our sins Lord Lord we we ask you to come and just cleanse us today wash us in your blood Lord we thank you for being here with us we praise you and we love you in Jesus name amen amen First Chronicles chapter 13 and verse 1 is going to be with you this morning thank you for letting us go last week to the meeting in Galena I appreciate it I know some of you made it up but we really had a good time in the Lord and but always enjoy coming back and always enjoy being with you on a Sunday morning and when we can all get together you know I know a mother feels like when all their children are around the table at Thanksgiving is just a highlight of your life you know if you could ever get them all there that's what we feel about church sometimes we could ever go get everybody here but but I'm glad you're here this morning and thank you for coming and we just enjoy so much the fellowship with you and around the word of God because I know you're Believers and and it's so good to preach the Believers I don't know what we would do if we had to preach unbelievers all the time make Believers I know there's some of that in every church but I'm just going to believe your Believers this morning and that you're wanting to hear the word of God so you just pull on the word and I know God will bless you this morning and even questions you may have maybe he just answered those and I wouldn't even have to know about it he could just answer it and uh isn't he don't you believe he can do that this morning he's that kind of God I know he's done it before he can do it again good to see each and every one of you this morning first Chronicles 13 and 1 and David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds and with every leader and David said unto all the congregation of Israel if it seemed good unto you and that it be of the Lord our God let us send abroad unto our Brethren everywhere that are left in all the land of Israel with them also to the priests and Levites which are in their cities and suburbs that they may gather themselves unto us let us bring again the Ark of our God to us we inquired not at it in the days of Saul and all the congregations said that they would do so for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people and we'll pick that up and read some more here in just a moment amen the Lord has blessing to the word you may be seated got communion tonight don't forget that always a wonderful time and then uh we'll have next Sunday night like to have a youth service for uh young people all of you can show up I expect you to show up if you normally come on on a Sunday night but uh but I want to gear that to the young people if we can and just support them how many appreciate our young people and and the children go ahead that's all right some of you didn't clap because you feel like you're young so but I want to gear that towards them next Sunday night but Joel's going to preach and just be praying about that you know we we every one of us every generation has to have their own Revival and and I felt that really strong on Wednesday nights you know our children need to be saved they need to be born again and and they need to come to Christ and they need to know that there's a fountain open in the House of David for sin and for uncleanness you're going to make mistakes but there is a blood that can cover every sin every mistake every problem you believe that yeah amen amen the ark as we've left it a couple of weeks ago was that courageous jerem for a hundred years and during that time Samuel had come and gone Saul had come and gone and now David was King and the Ark needed to be brought to its place and David understood that he felt the pressure of the hour to bring it to its place but there was a time and a season for that now I want to take all the mystery out of this sermon this morning and and tell you up front that I do not believe that we're living at this time where the ark is shut up somewhere and we have no access to it and we have no ability to uh to look at it I believe we're at the other side of this story when the ark has been restored back to the temple and the and the presence of God moved the pillars and and in Solomon's Temple that is a type of the Bride the the place where we are today I believe that's where we're at I do not believe this is a time of hoping for Revival I I do not believe this is a time of looking for somebody to come along and and give us Revival or a time of looking to some man or some group of men or somebody to get an idea that'll bring Revival I believe this is the bride's Revival I am the Revival for the hour that I live in you are the Revival for the hour that you live in so you know many times we this may be brother branham's sermon on trying to do God of service maybe one of the most misrepresented sermons that there are because what he's preaching about is something that took place during the time he was living and yet and yet people could handle God's word wrong today I understand that but that's not what he's talking about he's talking about a Pentecostal move that wanted Revival but they didn't want to pay for it they wanted Revival but they didn't know what season they were in they wanted Revival but they didn't consult the prophet they wanted Revival they understood a need for Revival but they didn't understand that the ark had to be brought back at the right time by the right person in the right way but I'm here to tell you this morning the ark has been brought back by the right Prophet at the right time in the right place and you and I live in a time of unlimited possibility we live in a time when everything is open and the book has been open and I don't care if it's 10 years or 100 years or a thousand years until the coming of the Lord but we live in a time when we can grab a hold of the things of God there's no more delay there's no more looking back at another age you're looking forward to another age this is it or you want Revival this is it are you wanting the power of God this is it we've just got to participate in it we need to be a part of it this is what's coming if not now as we preach here some months ago if not now when if not here where it's not us who yeah somebody's got to do it and it won't be any kind of a it's not a one-man Ministry anymore it was a one-man Ministry and a prophet but this is a bride move we've moved on from that we've moved on from politics we've moved on from those things we've moved on from denominations now there's a time I I'll say this if you Now's the Time To Worship yeah Now's the Time to Now's the Time to praise God Now's the Time to believe for what you have need of Now's the Time to walk in Victory Now's the Time we're not living in a denominational age [Music] so I'm not going to preach this this morning to scare you all if I do something wrong I'm going to I'm going to bring the ark back in the wrong way no that's not the point of it at all we want to see where that move that denominational move was mistaken and were they messed up and and true people could do that again today but not if you know where you're at not if you know what you believe so it's a word Revival brother Brandon says not an intellectual Revival or an emotional Revival but a word because it started by the word of a prophet amen right right so so just to get that out of the way now there's a principle in Scripture that obedience is better than sacrifice how many understand that today obedience is better than sacrifice so it's never right to do the right thing the wrong way the end never justifies the means you could be as right as rain about your Doctrine and mistreat people with it the end never justifies the means it is never okay no matter how right you are about what you believe or how right I am about what I believe it is never okay to mistreat people because they see it differently it's not okay to treat people wrong and that goes for all of us church it's not okay somebody's a little bit different or they're new or something like that we were all new one time we were all a bit different one time we were we've all been caught up in sin we've all had a past we've all had things that went on but I'm so glad for the blood of Jesus that covers every sin so it's never right to do the the right thing the wrong way do the right thing the right way hey man it is possible to do it this isn't politics the end does not justify the means right you can't just go in there and say well you never want to see how the sausage sausage is made but you like the the result that's not how the word works right you got to do the right thing the right way at the right time and the thing is we can do that by the help of the Holy Spirit so there's an idea and I've preached it before and you've heard it I'm sure there's a theory called chaos theory that that you know any amount of chaos whenever you have a complex system say like the weather and you introduce any amount of difference in that no matter how small it is at the beginning of it but random describes it in a simple way he said if you have a shotgun or a rifle he said it's not it's not uh just exactly right he said you may start off just a little bit wrong when it gets to the end it's that far off and the reason is because of Chaos Theory Chaos Theory means that uh it's the butterfly effect if a butterfly flaps its wings in South America it might result because of of what it does to something and it does to something and it does to something it might result in a typhoon in the Pacific right because everything matters yes and so I know some of you now you're going to be thinking about that the rest of the sermon and but it's true everything matters and that's why no matter how legalistic you are you can never govern your life to the point of well I'm just going to do every little thing right and then I'll be okay you can't do that you don't even know what right is but those that what those who are the sons of God they were led by the spirit of God and he's the only one who can do that because he knows you're tomorrows he knows why that the thing happened the way it did he knows why you lost your job he knows why you lost your loved one he knows why you went through what you went through because any little thing down here might have affected something up there so he said he said we know that all things someone say all things all things work together for the good to them who are called the called of Jesus Christ then they love God so we know that whatever he does is good I want to talk to you about that tonight maybe before communion whatever God does is good we got to trust him in that so but but there's there's an idea that little things matter they do matter little things matter sometimes just just the fact that you come to church or or that your attitude in church it matters to the whole service talks about a child running around the sanctuary one service and how it would have an effect on the next service every little thing matters Benjamin Franklin put it this way he said for want of a nail the shoe was lost for one of a shoe the horse was lost for one of a of a rider the battle was lost for one of the battle the kingdom was lost and offered one of a horseshoe nail so the little things matter the Bible said the little foxes spoil the vine so in good intentions are not enough we need to do things according to the word right so David's intentions were good when he wanted to bring the ark back he was right that the ark needed to be restored he was right about about wanting to go get it he was right even to call a meeting that's not what David did wrong but God does not brother said God does not give us merits on Good Intentions there's only one way to serve God that's by doing his will his command and God being Sovereign there's no one to tell him what to do or how to do it he does it the way he knows the right way to do it but one great thing about God aren't you glad for a great God he has not left us he said without knowing what's the truth and how to do it Hallelujah he doesn't punish us without telling us what to do right right he always gets a warning before judgment he's a God that speaks the word and expects his children to believe it and therefore he knows what's best and when to do it and how to do it he said we have our ideas of it but he knows so we should always examine what we're doing no matter what it is no matter how little it is by the word and when I'm when I'm talking about that just take the scriptures and then take the light on the scriptures which is the message of the hour and see if what you're doing matches up and if you don't understand it or you you can't search it out go and ask your pastor or ask a a minister about that I appreciate you asking questions but then if you still don't understand begin to seek the Lord ask him to reveal it to you because many times though it's not the things we don't understand that gives us problems it's the things we do yeah and I found a lot of times people are looking for a way out of the word and so that's why they uh they question something it's not because they don't don't understand it sometimes and sometimes we do have sincere questions but other times it's just we really would like for God to make an exception yeah now come on you're human you've been there would be really nice Lord if you make an exception in my case but the word is to the word and I've always told people this you're going to mess up you're going to do things sometimes that are stupid because human beings have a stupid element to them that's just the way it is you're going to be stupid sometimes but but just but just acknowledge that the word is true the word is true no matter what I do no matter what you do no matter what somebody else does the word is Right 100 times out of a hundred so you acknowledge the word is true and and surrender your life to that word and move on so there don't try to justify what you do now just because something is a religious Act does not mean that the Lord is in it right right and we see many people having religious acts today just because it's a religious act doesn't mean God is in it you say well brother so-and-so said we should worship this way well that don't mean God's in it right it may be a religious act but that don't mean God's in it well well the Baptists go to church the Methodist and I'm I've got no problem with that with those people there's Godly sincere people uh in those groups but but they're under a system just because they're religious don't make them right like my grandpa always said this he said he said we can't all be right but we could all be wrong but somebody's got to be right somebody's got to be right so there's got to be something that you stand on something you can grab a hold of something that's true yes so now so how do we know if what we're doing is is thus saith the Lord if it's according to the word but the Bible said there were five musts that get give us uh tell us whether it's the word whether it's the will of God or not five musts now this is what he said he said it must be his time it must be his season so it must be his time must be at the right time it must be a season he talks about it can't be like Noah's gospel yeah right it's got to be the in today's light yeah the light of the hour he said it must be the man he chose so just because something is timely just because something is in the right season doesn't mean that you're the one to do it yeah right or I'm the one to do it so there's always got to be an element of it you've got to be the one that was chosen to do it you say how will I know that and I keep going back to this brother Brandon said one way you know that you have a gift to see if you can do it or not all right all right don't don't kick against the Pricks if it's something you you're obviously not good at and and it's not a blessing to the bride you'll probably shouldn't be doing it I know that's too simple for some people but many times that's that's the way it is you gotta be the man for the job but the woman for the job in a job that a woman can do it must be a prophet now whatever Brandon is saying here he's saying that a prophet it's got to come to a prophet the idea had to come to a prophet right we have church order the way we do because of a prophet right we we have uh we have all our services everything's ordered the way it is because it comes from the scripture a prophet preached the word but a prophet said it in order yeah so we do those things because of profit so the idea for this revival had to come from a prophet yeah I'll go a little bit farther the announcement of this revival had to come from a Prophet come on hey man he had to announce that it was coming and that it was on now and finally the prophet must be Vindicated so it can't be just anybody that sees Visions yeah because he said your old men shall dream dreams your young men will see Visions yeah right we believe that there will be people who see Visions but they're not that Prophet right right there will be people who have true prophecy but they're not that prophet right so the idea for this revival must come through not just any Prophet but a Vindicated Prophet if you go back and study it but the brown said a Vindicated Prophet is a prophet to the age right someone say that with me a prophet to the age right what is that I mean there's only five stars in his hand right five Messengers that's it they're not six there's not or seven rather I said five they're seven some of y'all Said Amen to that I'm not one of those there's seven Messengers right I wasn't trying to trick you I messed up there's seven messages in his hand right yeah so there's not eight there's not six let's see if you pay attention now there's not 12. they're seven yeah Seven Stars one for each Church age and the seventh was the last one and he was the one who was revealed the mystery to the age so it's not just a prophet not just any Prophet but a Vindicated Prophet are you with me so far now David had some of these things but not all of them right right so you find that in first Chronicles 13 15 David gathered all Israel together from shy of Egypt even into the entering of emath to bring the Ark of God from kurdisturium now again it wasn't wrong to bring the people together but why is he bringing the people together what time are they coming together and did it begin with the Vindicated prophet verse 6 and David went up in all Israel to Baylor it is to courage of cheer him which belonged to Judah to bring up then it's the Ark of the Lord that dwelleth between the cherubims whose name is called on it and they carry the Ark of God in a new car oh my yeah out of that remember They carried it on a new card out of the land of Philistines nothing bad happened right so now they're doing it again a new car well that's the way it came up so it came back to us so it must be right the denominations come brought so much light they did things a certain way it must be right but it's not right today because we know better right so so now they they come up with a new card and and uh and he carried the Ark of God and USA in Ohio Draves the cart and David and all Israel played before God with all their might with singing with Harps with sulturies with Timbers with symbols and with trumpets must have been some service and when they come to the threshing floor of chadon USA put forth his hand to hold the ark he didn't have bad intentions he was just caught up in a system that had gone wrong right and for the auction stumble and the anger of the Lord was kindled against us and he smote him because he put his hand to the ark and there he died before God and David was displeased because the Lord had made a breach of an uza wherefore that place is called Perez USA to this day and so with their attempt to bring the ark remember they had to take it back and leave it in somebody's house and Lord will get to that and finish this up next week but he he they took it back and put it in someone's house and they said we can't handle the word it it just not we're not able to yet I'm so glad we don't live in that day I'm so glad we don't live in the day when the word cannot be opened to us but I'm glad that the word has come and we live in the time we can inquire of God and we can receive from God so wonderful now what went wrong brother Brandon said there were three things that went wrong three things he said they'd already done one thing wrong two things wrong he said first they never consulted Nathan right so remember they consulted all the leaders but there's no mention they consulted the prophet right right Prophet Nathan was the prophet during that time he said the next thing they did they went down there by not Consulting the word of God where Samuel was the word in that day never consulted the word of the Lord when they did they went contrary to the word of God so that's they built a new art new cart right so he said here this good man that had been a caretaker he was a bishop thought well here I don't want God to be let down so he put his hand on the ark where he wasn't a levite and he died three things he says so let's let's put it just in another way so you'll catch it this morning Nathan wasn't consulted the ark was carried on a new cart and uza put his hands on the ark now brother random said God revealed the thing to them by David and by the ministers and by the people and by the captains of thousands and captains of hundreds but not by Nathan who had thus saith the Lord so whenever somebody comes to you and said this is what you should be doing this is the move of God this is what we should be doing as a church we need to go and find out if if it was the prophet that said it we need to find out have you consulted the message of the hour is this something that a prophet taught is it plain simple teaching is it what a prophet said yeah yeah see because and that's where people get all down through history of this message we can say history and how it's been uh maybe 60 years since this message came along and its strength and its fullness and and here come uh here come one move after another after another and once they had this Revelation and that one and they said go here and go there but remember that's exactly what Jesus said to watch for he said they'll say here is Christ the anointing here is Christ the anointing he said don't follow them yeah right one after another after another they had one idea after another after another but I'm not following an idea I'm following the word of God yes sir so they had one Revival after another after another one thing after another after another but there is a Revival for me there is a Revival for us we are living in a time of the return of the Ark when the arc has returned there is a Revival but it's not the Revival that men taught us yeah but it's one that Nathan the Prophet The Prophet to the age the Vindicated Prophet said would be so they they consulted everybody else but him yeah and the Lord said he would do nothing until he showed the prophet of the age what'd he say the Lord God will do nothing surely the Lord God will do nothing except to revealth his secret to his servants the prophets Amos 3 7. so he would do nothing except he showed the prophet of the age first what to do yeah you see what they did they went straight out of the word of God went and put the ark upon a new car so they went about to do it apart from God's commandment and God's provided way and again I don't many times this message in particular this uh this part of the message is sermon brother Branham preaches is used to scare people into doing nothing yeah well you should never have me she should never go to me you really need to just sit home and listen to your pastor uh you know I'll say this if all the preaching you ever heard was me you would not come into maturity as a bride do you know that if I'm all the preaching you ever heard you would not come into maturity as a bride how do you know that brother Ben because the Bible says that they'll come into maturity until we all come in the unity of the faith there would be five distinct Ministries we don't even have five preachers in the church so if all you ever feed on is this church boy it got quiet so I have no problem with you feeding on whatever you can get fed yeah but first we ought to feed where God has placed us because God has something to say right to us see he loves us so much he got something to say to me he's got something to say to you and this is where he wants to say it but he got something to say but there will be evangelists and and Prophets and and teachers he said how can you say that because he said there would be there would be inspired preaching there would be all of those things that would come and then preach to you and that's why we try to have other preachers and other ministers and I say take advantage if anybody's preaching the truth go go go listen to it I have no problem with that just make sure you know what what direction the church is headed and and where you're at because God provides so so simply for us but you can't just listen to me this is not I am not the pastor to the world yeah or the pastor to the age as brother Branham put it yeah that's not I'm not God had a prophet I'll say this we need to be getting in that message but but again you can receive from all the fivefold ministry I believe God's got them today do you believe that happened and he said well brother Ben they got a bit different idea than you do they could be right I'm not the end of all knowledge I just said he had five stars in his right hand I mean are you with me now I'm not trying to disparage myself or make you think less of me but you can't think less of me than I do so be all right someone said somebody talking about you and the man said well that's all right he said they couldn't they couldn't say what if they knew what I knew you know didn't say nothing about me it's worse than what I knew I was a sinner yeah but I come to Christ so uh you know I don't always have the right idea but we try to stay as close to the word as we can but the bear said about baptizing babies he said let them do that if they want to but we want to try to stay as close to the Bible as we can it's closer that's what my desire is let me say it's close to the word of God as I can amen so there may be things I'm not telling you I would preach an error I don't believe I would I believe God will protect us here I believe he'll keep us but I believe he keeps other people too and and there's others that you can you can feed on and you can be a part of that but but remember God God made us a body it's not a one-man move right it's a body I'm getting way off my notes here but we have Trustees for a reason and trustees do their job I don't even have to know about it I know that sounds but really I mean especially minor things like that if it's a big thing that's going to cost a lot of money the whole church ought to decided we have Trustees for a reason we have beacons for a reason and if the deacons decide they want to uh they need to do something and and I'll be glad I'd be happy if they'd inform me about it before they do it so I would know what's coming but if they decide to do something that's up to them they have a job that I don't have the deacons have a job the trustees have a job the song leaders have a job I've got a job stay right here with the word but so do you every one of you has a job in the church every one of you belong in the house of God if God has put you here you've got something to do you matter in the house of God it matters that you show up in the house of God it matters that we see your face it means something yeah God cares I care the people care if you show up and you know if we care and we ought to and I want to commend you I've gotten so many testimonies of people say oh the church is so friendly let's keep that up Church let's keep doing that let's be as friendly as we can be let's talk to people you don't know that might be the last seed of God that might be the last one and it might be because you're reading them at the door that they have the right attitude to come to church right never get cultish and clenished remember the Antichrist Spirit started with a click in the church should never do that right well we need to be together we're a body yeah yeah so Brandon that says this because and my point in all of this is to say that that this message is used to scare people but that's not what I want to do at all I want to I want you to do things for God I want you to live for God I want you to be happy I want you I want us to have meetings I want us to I want to do everything we can for God I'm trying to explain myself on putting these services on the internet I don't do that because I think I'm the world's pastor we do that because if I can help one person if this church could help one person by being wide open on the internet then we'll do it right I just I don't have enough Hubris in me to say that I can be everybody's Pastor I can't be and this can't be everybody's church but God is called somebody to listen so we'll just be as open about it as what we can be yeah so but I don't I want you to do I want you to serve god without fear yeah and but know where you're at no that you're serving him under the word of the hour no the ark has been restored stay with the message sober the random one time is having an altar call and he says this he said listen friends he said I know they say Pentecost they organize Pentecost he said that's wrong Pentecost is an experience the Methodist get it the Baptist get it all then get it Pentecost is not organized it's an experience he said if you haven't had the experience of Pentecost come receive it now he said remember if you believe me to be a servant as Prophet remember there is a genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost right in the midst of all the fanaticism there is still a genuine Holy Ghost there is a genuine life do you believe that today he said you come believe it right now he said oh that must be early in his ministry 1964. making an altar call Brother Branham how could you being a little sarcastic there in case you're a person who doesn't doesn't understand sarcasm easily I try not to be sarcastic in the Pulpit for that reason because I don't always get sarcasm now look brother said if there's someone sitting here that's never had to be that beginning Spirit experience You Gotta Have It brother Brandon taught us the Holy Ghost was not just an idea or an assimilation or just you become it you got to have an experience with God and so he said if there's someone here that's never had that beginning Spirit experience got that same spirit that poured out in the beginning why should we take a substitute why should we take something fanaticism why should we take some radical cold formal indifferent Creed when the Pentecostal skies are full of the real genuine article why take a substitute he said Lord he's praying he said let's go back to the beginning and receive it like they did at the beginning and had the same work signs Wonders that there's the same fruit love joy peace long-suffering goodness meekness gentleness patience let's preach all of it let's have all of it let's believe all of it I'm I'm out for a church that's got the signs in it and it gets in it but I want a church got love in it Church got gentleness in the church got peace in it I want to see us bearing the Fruit of the Spirit let's do it all I refuse to take someone's false choice yeah to your wife you if you believe the word you can't have any emotion nonsense not what a prophet taught right right how they work again they were not wrong to have a meeting you can't show me in the message where brother Brown said they were wrong to have a meeting and we're not wrong to be emotional how do you know that brother Ben because when they brought the ark back they did it in the same way yeah they called all the singers back together and had the same meeting but this time under the direction of the word [Music] no they they were not wrong to dance because David danced before the Lord with all his might Michael criticized him and and she lost her ability to have children because she criticized that so so we don't want to do that we don't want to be a non-bearing church I'm not talking about an accident almost spiritually so they were not wrong to dance or to have music so but you know I think the problem begins with not Consulting a profit because many people I found many folks are not really concerned about not Consulting brother Branham they're concerned because nobody consulted them it wasn't their idea you let it be the pastor's idea or The Bishop's idea or the Evangelist idea boy it's all good yeah yeah right but because it wasn't their idea and they said well it must be wrong I'll say this you worship God how you feel to worship God I Don't Dance much because number one I don't want to cause any earthquakes I'm standing in their church and brother uh brother Ben I think they're I don't want to reveal any secrets but I think they've been in plans anyway they may build a new Sanctuary but the old sanctuaries got a wooden floor it's up on it's not concrete like this I'm glad ours is concrete but they got a wooden floor and I stood up there and realized you know they had a name for me in the meeting because there's two bins so they called Ben beard younger Ben and me Elder Ben because he's he's two years younger than me and I got to preaching I think it was Saturday morning and I got or Sunday morning I got winded and I said you know I said it shouldn't been the name shouldn't have been uh Elder Ben should have been Big Ben and and I really did you know if I had fallen because because I got to preaching you know and I got kind of weak and I thought well if I fail I'm gonna I'm gonna break through this floor and we found out later the floor may have had some problems I heard a pop what brother Harvey come to me said brother Ben you're probably be the last preacher to preach on this floor but Where'd I started with that Joe's lost that's he's always lost so don't matter I found again people are not worried about Consulting a profit they're worried about Consulting them I believe in the dance that's where I was going I believe in a dance but if I do much dancing you might not have a floor left because this is wood up here but but I'll say this not everybody's a dancer yeah yeah but there's times I feel like an old dinosaur and I just want to sit at the back and I'll be honest with you and let the young people take it there's times I feel that way but also know that there's a real power of God and there's a real presence of God and again as I said earlier I don't I want to be like Moses and say Lord if your presence is not with us then then I will not want to go I don't want to go a service without the presence of the Lord I don't want to go a time of gathering together without the sweet influence of the Holy Spirit I want him to be present not just in our services but in our homes it's your home just become a place where it's a dead dry confession where you pray over your food and you pray with the kids but there's no there's no feeling in it then we need to get back to what really that's good that you do it but you need to get back to where there's a feeling in it where there's something inside of you it may not be a big dance or a big show but there needs to be a reality to it all right I've told you before you know we want our young ones to come to an altar and we do yeah we want them to serve God we do but maybe it ought to start with us maybe we ought to be the ones coming to the altar many people we ought to be the one seeking God for our children we I will say this I refuse to lose this generation I refuse to get so busy that this generation passes on and they go out in the world again I say it's time we took advantage of the word that we have and lived for God and do what God says keep our children say you can't do it I absolutely believe you can there may be some leave they'll come back yeah yeah because we there's a power here yeah but I believe there's a power to keep them yeah these young men dressed in suits and ties right here in the front I tell you what we got four people four kids where we're raising a new generation in this church I'll tell you what I got four young men on the front row we're wearing suits and ties I tell you what keep it up boys keep it up it's not just how you dress but it's how you approach God I don't want to lose one of them I don't want to see one of them go out and experience even what I experienced and even though I was mostly in church and to live for God I don't want him even to have my scars I don't want them to have some of the scars you all have you ever are you with me now I want to see them live for God with all of their heart I want to see them and seek the Lord with all their heart I know sometimes you think that that we're tough and rough and and we just we got rules and things like that that's not what that's not about do's and don'ts yeah but it's about we're trying to protect you I want to see you be able to worship God and have no memory of those things that that come back and try to keep your hands down and try to keep you from from doing what God said I want to see you be able to Worship in Freedom love God with all of your heart I don't want to repeat the mistakes in my past I hope you forgive me this morning I I guess I got comfortable got way off my nose but I don't want to repeat I don't want to repeat my dad's mistakes I don't want to make it a law I don't want to make it a that's something where I beat my kids into submission and and then they're always just trembling in fear and and learn how to be good Hypocrites I don't want that I want something real I want something I want my kids to know there's a home to come back to there's a power of God to live there's something that can keep you in this world whether you go to private school or public school or home school there's still a God who can keep you all right breaks down good y'all just pulling too hard I'm not gonna get to this but bogus dollar only proves there's something real right we don't have to just because David made a mistake but it'll keep us from having meetings right don't keep us from rejoicing worshiping God yeah just a scarecrow yes because it proves there's something real let's have the real thank you Lord these discernments visions brother Brown said we have plenty of impersonations we always but remember before there could be a bogus dollar there has to be a real dollar first there has to be a real dollar then they're they're made off of that it's like we had a real Moses and a real Heron we had a jamberson Janice after them he said you see how it all comes they see it and then they try to impersonate that when there's truly one original and I'll say this if someone has a gift I wouldn't fight that I just watch and see what it produces well it produced it could be a real gift that people use in a wrong way but thus saith the Lord came in our age to a prophet to the eagle of the age and under that anointing every one of us have thus saith the Lord not because we're prophets but because we have a prophet's message the brainer said there are spirits of the gifts that's in the church but the only person that has a right to say thus saith the Lord is a Vindicated problem everything else is to be judged before it presented to the church the bride has thus saith the Lord or she keeps still what is this saith the Lord the message of the hour is that all right yeah there's only one Messenger to this age brother Branham I don't have time to get into all this but brother Branham talks about how and this this meant a lot to me he said there'd be I don't deny there'll be people like agabus and things like that I'm sorry I'm going to skip on you sister Joanna he said but I deny upon the infallible evidence of the word that there's more than one major prophet messenger who will reveal the Mysteries as contained in the word and who has the ministry to turn the hearts of the children to the fathers thus saith the Lord by his unfailing word stands and shall stand and be Vindicated you say how has he Vindicated you're the Vindication of this message the fact that you are still here every other ism is gone it's washed up in the Dustbin of history that we are the Vindication in spite of the Cults and everything else we still believe the message of the hour we are the Vindication my family your family is a Vindication of this message Hallelujah Seven Stars in his hand as we said not eight or nine if I waited till I got to my note side I got it right Deuteronomy 4 brother uses that in this sermon he said he said no hearken Israel into the statutes under the judgments which I teach you to do them that you may live and go in and possess the land which the Lord God of your father has giveth you you shall not add into the word which I command you neither shall you diminish ought from it neither shall you diminished heart from it that you may keep the Commandments of the Lord your God which I command you he said so say hi in the name of Jesus Christ don't you add one thing don't take put your own ideas in it you just say what is said on those days you just do exactly what the Lord God has commanded to do don't add to it he said I bring heavens and earth before you today in a challenge has God ever said anything he has not fulfilled and done exactly what he said he would do for us hasn't he done it just the way he said he would do it he said that's exactly so will he continue to do it just don't add to it don't take from it just believe it and we'll come over for the Lord your God for we're nearing the going into the land Hallelujah Amen brother Brandon said it's got to come a Bible word Revival we've read that recently so I'll skip past it but he talks about him how that when it falls today and quickens you get the same results you did in Acts 2. how many believe that he said always has and always will be because it's the spirit of God that conditions the atmosphere yeah remember they never consulted Nathan right are you still with me this morning they never consulted Nathan but we did yeah yeah say brother Ben how can you how can you be sure how can you have a meeting how can you have a church how can you why don't you just go back and sit and listen to the prophet because we consulted Nathan Hallelujah we consulted the prophet of the age and brother Branham got the idea from the angel God spoke in our day yeah hey man give me that next quote there he said some of you people that really believe this to be the truth we're entering in another age we're entering the raptured age you know the church can't go in this condition it can't get any better it must get worse it's got to get worse it can't go like this see it's got to be something and it's moving right now for him it's on the move is on for the bride that's the saith the Lord then we don't have to wait on somebody to come along and start it I don't have to wait on some preacher or some church to start the Revival their Revival's in me when they went overseas in the Welsh Revival the policeman was standing there and he's standing and the the delegation from the U.S comes to him and they said where is the Welsh Revival Oh my he said it's right here they said where he said I am the Welsh Revival they didn't have to wait to find it they had already found it because they found somebody who embodied the Welsh Revival let me be that person yeah that believes God during my Revival people got the wrong idea what a Revival is they think well often were in Revival nobody will ever be sick nobody will ever be come on huh there will be a Revival like that it's a part it's the ending of this revival when we go home won't be nobody sick there won't be nobody unhappy in that new body we'll understand we'll know even as we're known while we're here we get sick we have trouble but you're still in Revival why a prophet Prophet said the word was coming back and did come back see we didn't put the Ark on a new card the brand said that was a a new denomination he started he started up he said when you start wrong you keep on going wrong I'm skipping down he said again that's the way David did he had it hitting his way so he just said you know what I'll do we're moving he had a revelation we're moving now so we'll do a new way the days of Miracles has passed so we'll just make us another organization we'll build a new cart showing a new thing that started he said what a false prophecy you've got to go back the way God said do it and put it on the shoulders of the Levites and that was over the heart the ark the word is not to be packed upon a new denomination upon the theories of some man but in the heart the word of God is not to be handled by denominations it's to be handled by the heart of a man where God can come in there and reveal himself again he said the Levi's shoulders was God's original way to do it they put on a new cart remember that's their second mistake right the first mistake they didn't consult Nathan the second mistake they put it on a new cart he said now it'll never work they didn't consult the right way and that's what's happened today when men no matter how sincere try to do him a service outside of his provided way of revealing it they always mess it up God sets it in his way man no matter how sincere you try to do it outside of that you'll mess it up again he said the word is not in the mind it's in the heart not on a new cart he said it represented something new spoke of every denomination there'd ever be he said but the he said the word is a baptism of the Holy Ghost in the heart of man not in some ecclesiastical move the holy spirit is The Treasure of God's love in the heart of men and women to obey it was on the shoulder of his ministers his ministry is supposed to Levi's put it up over their left shoulder and packed an ark like that because it was up over their heart they had the burden of the word on their heart come on he said God won't leave his program that's the reason we know that this day's got to be simple somebody comes along and says we don't need preachers no more I don't need to go to church anymore he said that spirit's just in the message it's not it's in the world everywhere I've noticed people I try to witness to anymore you know what they'll tell you yeah I have church in my house if I tell them I'm a pastor I've been told that two or three times recently interesting Church in your house where did that Spirit come from I believe you could have it in your house if that's all you had the Main Place overseas I've had Church in people's homes yeah We Were Young in this message many times we had churches at homes it's where the bride is gathered together that's where we ought to be right if you're so picky you can't find a church anywhere that that I gotta quit somewhere there's a church and I'll say this be happy if you can't be happy going here go somewhere else be happy we'll try to make you happy but we can't you know we're going to change the word the word is what it is so so you you go and be happy and live for God do what's right it's too late an hour to be fussing and fighting and come on and be caught up in drama over time God won't leave his program God in the beginning could have made the sun preach the gospel the winds preaching off for an angel preach the gospel the ordain men for that purpose and he never changes it he never ordained denominations he never ordained groups of men he ordained men to preach the gospel not Machinery Mechanical Devices or any Angelic being it was men yeah it may anything contrary to that as a new car the third mistake they made USA put his hand on the ark brother Brown said he was killed because he was under that false inspiration many true Christians he said losing their experience back in old dead denominations because they're putting their hand on the ark when they're not ordained to do so brother Brandon again he said it was when that man died that David with the anointing saw what he had done wrong said David's anointing was right but when he saw people die listen if people are dying for the sake of God's people yeah yeah pay attention yeah right I say that because their Ward told me that he's always offering to sing for Brother Louie and uh you know but Daryl's not much of a I think he's actually a pretty good singer better than me but they don't think he's much of a singer so he's always offering to sing and Brother Louie always texting back and he said you come sing at five o'clock and and he said we don't have church at five o'clock he said that's right so you can sing then and then he was having dental trouble and but Daryl man said this I don't know but he said but Louie's having dental trouble and he he texted him and said I'll just pick Sunday morning he said that's all right with you he said I'll just take that and believe respond back he said for the love of God's people no foreign I say this in a serious way for the love of God's people if people are dying because of what you're doing wake up yeah preach the word quit preaching your complexes quit preaching your anointing your emotions but preaching everything else preach the word for the love if you see people being messed up being destroyed being torn apart preach the word so when that man died David with the anointing saw what he had done wrong though he said oh David you Pastor can't you see your dead Creeds and denominations you're holding on to can't you see what it's doing it's killing an oozer spiritually dead and you wonder why there ain't no Revival so letting your women cut their hair paint their face wear shorts send your boys away to Ricky schools somewhere like that he's talking about going to Seminary he said and so forth like that where half of them comes home homosexuals and everything look what you're doing should we do this with our children should we do that watch your children for the love of your children do the right thing by them watch your children every family is different every family's in a different situation watch your children every church is Sovereign watch your church yeah God help us to take the burden of the word on our heart for the church that we go to yes innocent people die why don't we put our hands on the ark immoral living in the church is always a symptom of false teaching always is they are commingled I cannot stand here and tell you I preach the truth and live in immorality it's impossible because what I preach is more than what I say but it's what I do and what I present to the people right and we've got to recognize that church and many times you see people start to go out and we see a all over the all over the place message children young people going out and becoming homosexuals marrying girls marrying girls boys marrying Boys still listening to tapes claiming to be right with God because I believe they have the token because they listen to a tape it's baloney yeah but they're going out and doing those things and and some take such they have they idolize their Pastor or somebody else and say well I had an emotion or something and I'm not gonna live any way I want to nonsense others are pastors have so closed them off from the from the word and from the from the spirit of the word that there's no Revival and they begin to go into immoral living because there's no Revival at all For the Love of God's people can't we look and see what's going on and come back to the word come back to what God Said come back to the Revival that that Nathan brought that the prophet to the age brought say it could never happen to us absolutely it could yeah but it won't say how do you say it won't because I won't let it you won't let it not going to sacrifice my children on Bill's altar yeah I'm gonna do what's right we're going to do a try you're gonna make right decisions how do you know that brother Ben I say that by faith but I know that because you're the Bride of Jesus Christ somebody's going to live it somebody's going to be it somebody's going to hold on to their children I don't mean to hold them in a way of holding them back from the world I mean to implant something in them that they can believe show them such a life that they no matter what they said they can say I want what dad's got yeah I want what I want what Mama's Got I may not understand it I may not agree with it but I want what they got because I know what happened when they got saved I know they were changed I know what my home life is like the prodigal son said I he said I oh God he said I know how my dad treats his hired servants and it has such an impact on me that I want to live for God I want to go back even if I'm just a servant but when he got back he wasn't just a servant he was a son yeah God help me to live so my children if you can see the Revival in me not just in the way I preach or the what I do God help me to live it at home help me to live it at home help me to so that people can see so my children can see dad's got something really he makes mistakes he's human but there's something real good I told you I'm being a little bit personal here I'm done I'm gonna have to quit uh brother Daryl Ward I appreciate that meeting with this weekend he was always been such an impact on me but it's not been because of way he preaches it's not what he preaches so I watch that man live and I saw what he's been through and his testimony and things and and I've gotten over the years at times where we'd be really close and then sometimes we don't talk for a long time but but I've gotten to where I I kind of rely on that you can rely on a life yeah yeah the way a person lives the way they treat people the way
