TRANSCRIPT
========================================
didn't say go teach he said go preach in other words demonstrate the power and these signs shall follow them just teaching doesn't do it it takes an actual Spirit itself demonstrating these signs listen to this that's your facei should not stand in the wisdom of man but in the power of God oh my see to change the man not in what I can explain away and say he's not the same when he is the same if I do that it's shows to me it it surely a man tell me that would show to me he don't have the Revelation the three-fold revelation of God see now and how be it in weakness among you that are perfect yet we not with the wisdom of the world but of the princes of this world that come to not but we speak the wisdom of God in mystery see the three-fold mystery of God even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world unto our Glory which none of the princes of this world knew none of the priests rebi rabbis pardon me or anything knew anything about it for had they known it they would have not crucified the Lord Of Glory you said you're wrong about rabbis and preachers there who crucified him amen oh on and on and on we could go read it on save time cuz we got uh uh just not getting late yet but we just we got plenty here to say if the Lord will help us now lack of this now and Paul this great intellectual man never tried to express his great theological terms upon the people he humbly accepted the word of the Lord and he lived the word so it expressed to he lived so so Godly until they seen Jesus Christ didn't so much so they wanted his handkerchief to take and laid upon the sick there's the Life of Christ now watch some oh you see Elijah done that long time ago lady you stick but oh that was the Days of Elijah now the world thought that the intellectual priests and things in churches of that day thought that but the unbelievers they know different they seen the revelation of Christ that was in Elijah same thing was in Paul expressed the same kind of life because he was a prophet he foretold things that happened exactly the way it was and they know that was God's identification of a prophet and they know he was God's Prophet you couldn't shake him from it at all even when they seen Peter foret tell those things and come to pass they said this let his shadow pass over me amen that's the church that's the ones that believe it yes sir is revealed by why did Paul say because I I got a pH lld D so forth they believe me no he said I forgot all those things of wisdom of Mind said had to die now I know him in the power of his resurrection that's what I come to you at with a demonstration of God God's power what was it making Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever the same works that Jesus did Paul did the same and they seen God the great father that had demonstrated in the burning bush had demonstrated to Paul and here it was being demonstrated and he's the same in every age God threefold manner yesterday today and forever what Redeemer in his church pimus in the coming Kingdom amen you see it just as perfect as he can be oh notice the Holy Ghost is the all only revealer of the divine revelation of Christ Hallelujah there's no school can do it no scholar can do it no man how well educated how Godly or anything else is no man can do it I could sting hard here how many Christians Born Again raise up your hands filled the Holy Ghost all right here we go then all right notice and he will only do it to the predestination Hallelujah all the father has given me will come and no man can come except the father's giving him to me first look at that priest said this man's be El he's a fortune teller he's a devil that little old woman walking around there living with six husbands she living with five and had the six one then and Jesus said go get your husband come here she said I have no husband said yes you've got six you've had five and the one you're living with now is not your husband she said sir what that light struck that seed when it struck that priest they said this man is a fortune teller see no Li there hybrid you come up as far as organization but died from their own but This Woman's not a hybrid said sir I perceive I can see a big pretty eyes shine up like that tears running down her cheeks says sir I perceive that you're a prophet I'm looking for a messiah and when that Messiah comes he'll do this very same thing he'll tell us these things he said I'm he oh Lord she left her PO here he is come see a man who's told me the things what was it that light struck that seed that life was there come forth same thing today but the theologians say I wait just a minute I find out it so and so Pastor Moody said or what's Pastor Moody got to do with this this day Pastor Moody lived in his day but not now certainly Luther lived in his day but not in the day of Wesley Wes live in his day not the day of Pentecost Pentecost living their day but they're long way from this we're in the last hour sure there are organizations and Scruples that proves that it's not there the word has never been correctly Vindicated just only in his strength seeds denominations and make denomination put that old gson weed seeds in with that genuine wheat died right out crop went to gson right green brers and nettles Hallelujah see went on back to that it died right out then it broke the field up and started over again planted some real seeds and some of them come up and choked it out but then God said in this last days he'd bring out of people washing his blood and they were predestinated to be there they've got to be there God say and he would reveal and the Very sign I was Malachi 4 and what he would do restore back again Hallelujah bring back in the last days these great things that he promise said bring the Revelation what is what to do Malachi 4 was to bring back the faith of the fathers to the children see that's right bring that same thing the same Pillar of Fire in on the scene the same signs the same wonders the same Jesus making him the same preaching him the same indicating him the same yesterday today and forever I will restore sayth the Lord all the years that the Methodist worm and the caterpillar worm and the Baptist and Catholic and all them worms eat that that Faith down to become a denominational stump where there's no seeds left in there but I will restore again sayith the Lord all the years what all the signs and wonders that they forsaken I'll take it right back to that original tree again and I will restore it sayeth the Lord that Prophet was a Vindicated Prophet his words has to come to pass amen the Holy Ghost alone is a revealer of the divine revelation of Christ and has been in all ages remember all ages who did the word of the Lord come to Prophet alone that's right is that right and the prophet had to be Vindicated first not because he said he was a prophet because he was borned a prophet and proved to be a prophet and everything he said was exactly on the word and come to pass then everything else let go see it was the word of the Lord came only by the Holy Ghost the Bible said the man of old moved by the Holy Ghost wrote the word look John the Baptist would never had known Jesus if it hadn't been for the Holy Ghost pointing him out that right John the Baptist that great prophet that come forth and said this one standing among you right now there an ordinary man standing here somewhere that's the Lamb of God John said that I bore a record I bear a record I saw the spirit of God the Holy Ghost descending from heaven like a dove and it went upon me and a voicey said this is my beloved Son whom I pleas what was it the holy ghost that I'll Point him out that's the only way you know him today only way you'll get the three-fold revelation of God is for the Holy Ghost and the only way it can ever be is you're predestinated to see it if it don't you'll never see it Hallelujah if you're not predestinated to see it you'll never see it CU that light can Flash you'll go away and make fun of it and explain it away with some intellectual conception when the very God himself manifesting himself and proving it see but if it ain't up on you to see it you won't see it God never just said out choose this one choose that one but he knew by his re he could predestinate because he's infinite and he he knows every he's infinite so therefore he knowed everything he know the end he could tell the end from the beginning he's God if he can't do that he's not God yes he's the infinite all right John would have never known him no sir had the Holy Ghost not pourn out see how God hides his mystery to the high educated and everything look every one of them people say and Simplicity reveals it to whom he has predestinated to sit look there other understanding by never even seen the dove they never heard no voice for it was always sent to that predestinated seed predestinated certainly was predestinated Isaiah 712 years before he was born in the spirit raised up out these human senses and said there's a voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare the way the Lord and make isah could see couldn't Malachi see the same thing predated last prophet seing off all the prophets of the Old Testament that man that great prophet stand there at the end of the age he say is predestinated certainly he was Malachi saw him too Jesus said if you can receive it this is he who has spoken of I say My Messenger before my face Malachi 3 to prepare the way before me see sure he was predestinated to see that message no wonder he can look down and see that Dove coming down that light that was in the wilderness with Israel coming moving down the God himself saying this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell in God in man becoming one I bear witness John said I'll beeld him the only begotten of the father amen I'm witness of it amen there you are Hallelujah Simplicity with an old preacher his father his father was a great Theologian you know he come out of a school look like he'd went back to his father's denomination that wouldn't been the will of God when God touched him at his birth back there and he received the Holy Ghost three months before he born Hallelujah yes sir when Mary went up there and little John was six months old in his mother's womb and had never them little muscles had never moved yet and Mary was afraid the little muscles were growing but she couldn't feel no life Elizabeth his mother brother her and when Mary come up and grabbed her and hugged her put her arms laid hands on her [Music] and God has spoke to me and I'm going to have a baby too are you and Joseph maryed no Mary how can this be the Holy Ghost shall overshadow me now be created in me amen and I shall call his name Jesus he'll be the Son of God and as soon as that word Jesus spoke Little John be to leap and shout and jump down she said blessed be the Lord God for whence come the mother of my Lord the mother of my Lord oh when comes the mother of my lord for as soon as your salutation come into my ears my baby leaped in the womb for Joy no wonder he didn't want no Seminary something indoctrinated him or something other he had a important job he was a man of the Wilderness went out into the Wilderness and waited God told him out there said now revealed to him oh there's your Revelation again now I'll tell you who he is you're a prophet the word to you you know who you are youve got to come that answers a question from last Sunday you know who you are John keep yourself quiet don't say nothing R out there and when you see this one there'll be a sign coming from heaven like a light a dove will come down that'll be him when you see him that's the reason when Jesus walked out in the water John looked over he seen that Dove coming down he said Behold the Lamb of God there he is he's the one that will take away the sin of the world Jesus walk right straight out in the water between him them two eyes of John met them two eyes of Jesus they were second cousins by flesh Mary and Elizabeth were first cousin their eyes met one another there was [Music] God [Music] it's done hallelujah it's

want to stay and have dinner with us we're going to have an Easter uh dinner here at the church for those that want to stay I know some people won go home and do that with their family but if you want to stay with us we' be glad to have you Ephesians 1:1 says Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the Saints which are at Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus Grace be to you and peace God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who ha blessed us all all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ excuse me according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us un the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will amen God bless you you can be seated we're going to continue on Christ as the mystery of God revealed if you just bear with me tonight I'm just having a little trouble getting started it's like an old truck you know you got to you got to gear up for a while before you can get to running good uh one of the Mysteries that the seventh angel cleared up was predestination and what that is is is God's uh choosing God's election of his people and we know all down through history through church history anyway people have stumbled over that people have struggled with that it's a hard thing even the great scientist Einstein he uh could not understand how a God that was Almighty and created the heavens and the Earth would would also allow Free Will and allow people to do bad things and he couldn't understand that and so he he actually got to a point where he didn't believe in a personal God just a Creator and there have been many people like that but we believe that our God he is the creator he is the one who made the heavens and the Earth but he's also a personal God he's my God how many believe that tonight he's my God he he knows my life he knows all about me so we believe that tonight we believe we're predestined by God we believe there's a bride today that's predestined by God but you had one side that was calvinist and what the Calvinists believe is that everything is pre-ordained I heard a uh a saying they said there were Baptist churches that were so scared of of the non-elect being attracted to their church that they wouldn't even put out a sign because they felt like that uh they could only wanted the elect to come so if you were elect you'd find it I heard of uh of two groups of theologians that got together and they were kind of fussing with one another one group was calvinist the other one was was Armenian and Armenians believe in just free will to the point they don't they don't believe God chooses at all and the Calvinists believe everything's pre-ordained and and so they got to fuss amongst each other and one went off in this little group of Calvinists another went off in a group of Armenians and one guy couldn't decide which way he wanted to go and and so finally he he made up his mind he said I'm going to go over here with the calvinist and he went over with the calvinist and they said what brought you here he saidwell I chose to come here he said they said nope' and you don't belong here said you belong over with that other group so he goes over to the Armenians and he they said what brought you here and he said I was sent they said nope said you don't belong here and uh you know the truth is usually in the middle of the road isn't it and and that's what brother brandham brought us and brother Bram said he was a calvinist so far as Calvin stayed with the Bible so that's what we believe so uh people struggle with that I heard a story just try trying to kind of lighten you up and tonight and but it it illustrates what we're talking about heard a story of a a calvinist father who believed everything was pre-ordained his children would just be pre-ordained even to their job and everything which I believe God uh cares about those things and knows those things but and even ordains those things but he actually uh had it such a radical idea of it that what he did is he when his son got to a certain age he he laid out three things in his house he laid out a Bible because he said well if he chooses the Bible he'll become a preacher and he laid out a bottle of whiskey said if he chooses the bottle of whiskey he'll be a drunkard and uh he laid out uh he laid out uh money he said well if he chooses the money said he'll be a merchant or somebody that a capitalist and so he uh he laid them all out on the table and he went in the kitchen and watched and here come his son he walked out there and first he picks up the money and puts it in his pocket and he walks over and picks up the puts under his arm picks up the whiskey and heads out the door and the man said well he must be a lawyer then going to do all three but I'm so glad we got revelation we can raise our kids and bring them up right we've got a responsibility to do that and yet we believe in a in a God who cares and and has given us our children they're going to be there we believe though both those things are true now uh people struggle with that because they can't comprehend the sovereignty of God Romans 918 tells us therefore hath he Mercy on whom he will have mercy and whom he will he hardens Romans 9:19 th will then say unto me why does he yet find fault in other words if he made me the way I am why does he find fault he said for who has resisted his will he said nay but oh man who art thou that repliest against God other words God he's God for reason he's a sovereign being he he does his own thing as he chooses to do it he said shall the thing formed say to him that formed it why hast Thou made me this so Paul reaches an argument where he's saying he created me he can do with me what he wants because he made me the creator has power over his creation because it belongs to him now he said uh he said hath not the Potter power over the clay of the same lump to make one vessel to honor and another un to dishonor in other words to to make them for different uses uses one that would be put up in the in the house as a vessel of honor and another to be used for a dishonorable purpose now we we we don't like that because we like to maintain the illusion of control in our lives and if you don't think that's true uh you know I I think most every one of us is a backseat driver when somebody else is driving maybe some not as bad as others but my mother is I know and and my wife is too and and I've been driving for Years brother Mark I I've never had a wreck it was my fault I I feel like I'm a pretty good driver but either one of those ladies get in the car and and I don't know anything about driving I can't make it I don't know where the exit is I I don't know how to get back to the house and if it wasn't for them I'd just be driving around in a field with nothing nowhere to go uh but and yet I get along fine when I'm by myself you know but there's a reason that we're like that I'm that way too when someone else is driving you know you you could prove to me that you're a better driver than me have a better record and and just be better about everything that you do uh driving wise you could prove that to me and I'd still feel better if I had my hands on the wheel why is that because we have we like the illusion of control that's why people would rather most people are more scared of airplanes than they are of driving even though driving statistically is proven to kill more people you're more likely to get in an accident but uh of course if you do get an accident in Airplane you're less likely to get out of it but but but that's why we we we like to be we like to have control we like to have our hands on the wheel and you can't do that with God we don't get to control God right you can't control God you can't control the preacher you can't control the church you can't control anything you can't even control your own family right because if you hold them like that you try to make every every decision for them and and everything as they get older they're going to be in a pretty sorry shape eventually they're going to have to you're going to have to trust that God's going to be able to keep that child and to help that child and brother brandom said you got to commit them to God let them go and let God let God do what God does you came out all right and God God had his hand on your life and he's got his hand on their life too but we've got to be able to do that that's tough because we want to be able to control the outcome but we can't control any outcome we we can't even control I could drop dead of a heart attack right now you we can't control that we can't control the outcomes we don't know what tomorrow brings but we know who holds tomorrow and we know he's good isn't he good tonight God is good and if he's good and he loves us and he cares about us then he'll do the right thing no matter what it is that we we are going through now brother brandham says this about about predestination he said since this portion of the word is hard for the human mind to grasp it must be accepted and believed by faith right amen and brother BR makes this argument he says God can do with us what he wants because not only did he create us but he bought CAU Us by his blood we are not our own Romans 14:7 none of us liveth to himself and no man dieth to himself for whether we live we live unto the Lord whether we die we die unto the Lord whether we live therefore or die we are the Lords for to this end Christ both died and Rose and revived that he might be Lord both of the dead and living he bought us with a price we belong to him yes sir now we know that Christ had a right to choose his family and I'm just laying this background as we go into this next part of what brother Bram taught he had a right to choose his family if he's got it he had to choose his family and so he chose us I'm so thankful for that tonight and you ought to believe that's you I believe that's me we know that salvation itself is open to everyone but we were chosen to believe we're of those that Paul talked about in 2 Thessalonians 2:13 he said we're bound to give thanks always to God for you Brethren beloved of the Lord because God has from the beginning chosen you to Salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth you've been chosen to do that you say well I just can't seem to make it he chose you to make it so you got to believe that brother bandam says this he said I would be a discouraged man this morning if I didn't believe in the election and calling of God if I thought that this world was left to the outcome of it by the power of man and by the wisdom of man by the big four and the UN who never even mentioned God's name I'd be a discouraged person but I'm not looking to that for the outcome he said I look down in the pages of this old book here where God wrote it out and everything someone say everything everything will come out just exactly the way he said it and that's all he said so the only thing for me to do is not line up with them but line up with Calvary line up with God line up with his word stay in his word he said no matter how much it looks like it's going to be that way it's going to be the way God intends it to be it can't be nothing else for him being infinite knew the end from the beginning and he makes everything come to his Praises right amen so we're going to go back to Christ is the mystery of God revealed now that we've laid that Foundation brother BR says predestinated there's the mystery he said he before Christ or anything else was ever on Earth you see his great mystery that he chose the bride what that means is not that he just chose a nameless faceless shapeless mass of people that's not what he did he chose you brother Joe he chose you individually sister Jackie he chose you Paul each person here he chose us he chose you before the foundation if you are the bride he didn't just choose a group of people he didn't just choose a church age messenger he didn't just choose a preacher but he chose you because God don't deal with the bride as a group he deals with you as individuals you believe that tonight and so if he deals with you as individuals then he chose you to be in that bride so you could say this you can take this personally he chose the bride knowing Eve would fall from disbelieving the word knowing that she would fall but he would choose a bride that would not fall now this is really important he he chose now we he has a right to choose and he chose a bride that would not fall that would hold to that word regardless of what all the rest of the world had to say about it didn't matter what they said he said he chose the bride now and so you say well a bride that would not fall how can you do that no he's able to do that he's not only able but he promised we talked about that a couple weeks ago but he's able how do we know he's able Jude 24 now unto him that is able someone say he's able to keep you from falling you don't have to fall he's able to keep you from falling and to present you what faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding Joy you'll find out that this this idea of the Bride not falling it's not that she's not going to fall because she just made up her mind not to fall but she's not going to fall because he won't let her fall right she's not going to fall because he has imputed Grace to her that there would not be any of it be her own works but it would be the grace of almighty God and he would not only sin the grace of God is Not Just forgiving you and letting you get with whatever you want to do but the grace of God brings you up into sanctification and the power of the baptism of the Holy Ghost he chose a bride that would be filled with the Holy Ghost at the end time he chose a bride that would not fall at the end time right they would hold to that word amen amen and he provided a message in our hour I wonder if we really understand what God did he provided the opening of the word the open book he he that there reason why it had to happen in our day because the bride that would not fall would have to become the full word so the full word had to be open before the end time and we're living in that day he said they would hold to that word they are predestinated to stand there so they will take a stand right it's not that they won't take a stand and they'll just make it in anyway but they will take a stand they're PR predestined to take a stand and they will take the right stand at the end time they are predestined to stand there the adoption of children by Jesus Christ that's what you're predestinated to is the adoption of children what's the adoption of children until we become Sons and Daughters of God full Sons and Daughters of God till we have power and authority with God the spoken word that's what God showed us was possible in our day we have been predestined in this day to be the full adopted Sons and Daughters of God we've been predestined to have the true baptism of the Holy Ghost we've been predestined to be to be sealed by the token to have be so sealed away in god Till the devil don't know what to do with us and I think I think here's the problem it's hard again for us to reconcile that and say if I'm a bride that won't fall why do I make mistakes well he never said you wouldn't make any mistakes he just said you wouldn't fall he never said you'd be perfect but you'd be perfect in his eyes 100% perfect in his eyes you may not be perfect in anybody else's eyes but you're 100% it gives me great hope it gives me great peace because I realize my shortcomings I I you don't have to tell them to me I know people think it's their job to tell preachers what the shortcomings are you don't have to tell me my shortcomings you don't have to tell me I'm a human I'm a human brother brand was human all of us are humans I I know I'm a human but I know that I'll make it by the blood of Jesus Christ I know you're going to make it by the same thing I know he he he he's put something in me he's called me to stand in this hour so I'm going to stand all right now I got to stand for the word that's what he called me to do and so that's what we have to do all of us have to do that now there would hold to that word they're predestined to stand there predestined the church that great glorious stand I say we ought to stand tonight let's just stand on the word if God taught it let's just believe it let's just stand on it let's not give up our morals let's not give up our dress let's not give up our worship let's not give up our our services we shouldn't give one service back to the devil and say well just we'll just have a we'll just have a regular service tonight let's stand on the word of God if he said we can have healing let's stand on that if he said these signs shall follow them that believe let's stand on that word believe that word walk into that word become that word amen let me stand Lord on the message of the hour hey man listen if your idea today is that nobody's right but you and I don't I know there's no one here that believes that but there's people that do if you ideas there's no one right but you everybody's always always doing the wrong thing but you got it right listen to me you that's not the kind of bride God has if your idea is that we're failing as the bride that the bride is somehow going back to the uh to Pentecostalism where somehow we're going some other direction that's wrong and and we need some Prophet to come along or some teacher to come along or some Pastor to come along and save us listen if that's your idea you don't believe the message of the hour because the message of the hour taught us we've got everything we need to go in a Rapture all we got to do is all we got to do is feed on it if you believe the Revival is over we're just going to go in by the skin of our teeth you don't believe what a prophet taught because he said he's predestined the bride to that great glorious stand not just predestinated to be there but predestinated to stand yeah right oh I hope you're hearing me tonight yes amen now listen we're not going to get in by the skin of our teeth look at Revelation 19:7 said let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife ha made herself ready she not waiting on somebody else to come along and provide she's already been provided what she has need of in this house to make herself ready brother Jeremy she's putting on her clothes she's going to do it she's going to do it when you said but every other age failed this one won't right right if it did we wouldn't be the the me it wouldn't be the message it wouldn't be the truth it wouldn't be the end times it wouldn't be the there'd have to be another age coming but there's not another age coming this is it so we've got to make it without us they can't be made perfect but I'm so glad he sent a power he sent an anointing he sent a word in our day that we can make it now now see we we've got to he said let's be glad and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is coming his wife is ready she has made herself ready Welly that's a that's a miracle in itself you ever been to a wedding I'm sure most of us have the bride's never ready on time but this bride will be that's what he's announcing the marriage of the Lamb is come and the bride's ready glory to God you said well I don't know I I don't know if I'll be ready by The Rapture you if you're the bride you will be you can't help but be why because the she was ready at the time of the wedding that's amen the time of the marriage supper when when we go to meet him in the air we'll be ready don't you doubt it one minute now look R said now you see his secret made himself a wife amen he made Adam a wife oh my and so now watch what he says he said took the rib from under his side and made Eve out of it so God did the same thing taking out of the side of Christ the blood and the water now watch Christ the word was made up of three elements water blood and spirit he was made up of water blood and spirit which is the type of the new birth and he takes out of his side there on the cross on Calvary he takes out of his side the blood and the water and the spirit he gave up the ghost now he said Christ is the word taking the word and making up his church Eve he said back to himself again Redeemed by the blood that was come from his body now watch Eve was already taken out and then she fell but this bride remained in him until she was redeemed it's how to make us run all over the church think about this nobody else taught us this this was a prophet to the age taught us this this bride remained in him when he healed the sick when he raised the Dead when he did the Wonders she was in him good and then he pulled her out at Calvary after he died amen and what's the significance of that is because she was already redeemed you said how could she fall she's already been redeemed amen that's why God could wink at ignorance that's why even there will be bride from the church ages even believed in the Trinity and things like that how could God do that she was already redeemed in his body and as long as the body reaches its fullness in this hour it redeems all of it GL to God amen he he she was brought back to him Redeemed by the blood that come from his body sir Hallelujah let's read it John CH chapter 19 I just want us to get this get this down tonight we won't move very far in this sermon but it just means something to me John 19:30 when Jesus therefore had received the vinegar he said it is finished and he bowed his head and gave up the ghost there's a spirit the Jews therefore because of was the preparation the body should not remain upon the cross on the Sabbath day for that Sabbath day was a high day besought pilot that their legs might be broken that they might be taken away remember the word says not one bone will be broken he said then come the soldiers and break the legs of the first and of the other which was crucified with him so they went from one side broke his legs went to the other broke his legs but when when they came to Jesus and saw that he was dead already they break not his legs but one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side and forth with came there out blood and water brother BR said when they killed Jesus At The Cross the substance come from his body to make up the birth they struck his side blood and water you realize you've been predestined to a new birth because that's what come out of his side he said blood and water come out and into thy hands I commend my spirit what came from his body was water blood and spirit now you can type that in his body was Luther Wesley Pentecost and the fullness right so that was in his body oh my a and that was what his that's what come out of his body to make up the bride now watch Eve was born as we said from Adam's pierced side and brother said when Jesus died at Calvary remember the bride was not taken from the body until the body was dead he had already died and they was going to break his legs and the prophet said there will not be one bone broken so they done draw back the hammer to break a leg and a man went up with a spear and pushed it through his heart and water and blood came forth you realize where you came from if you're the bride you realize where you came from you come out of his heart how could could you be lost how could you you said well I'm worried I'll be lost I'm worried some man will deceive me I'm worried some man will mistreat me and and that'll make me that'll make me where I'm lost no no you can't be lost you come out of his heart oh church he come out we come out of his heart he said he said he pushed it through his heart water and Blood come forth he was already dead he said she that's us was already redeemed in the body by his death yeah that's why we there's no more suffering tribulation period for the bride all these people looking for a squeeze to come and everything's going to get shut down we're all going to suffer he said there will be no more suffering tribulation for the bride why because we come out of his heart we've oh my we suffered with him we before we were before we ever came on the earth we were already redeemed in him right Hallelujah he we were redeemed in his mind before the foundation of the Earth but we were physically redeemed in him on the cross sir that's why Adam couldn't redeem Eve are you with me now because he couldn't he couldn't go back she'd already sinned and he couldn't keep her before you ever sinned amen he already redeemed you and took you from his side right Hallelujah right I I think if we get a revelation of that we'd never worry anymore if I Come From The Heart Of God what could possibly come against me that could separate me from him it wasn't a drop of his blood that was wasted wasn't one bit of that water that was wasted wasn't one bit of that spirit that was wasted if you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost today in this hour you have a seal from God you're going to make it sir and you can't possibly not make it because you're part of him I just love that now now again so brother Brenham picks up in Christ's the mystery he said God's great mystery now being unfolded that's been hid since the foundation of the world it was hid in him amen but prefigured it all the way down through he said now down Through the Ages he's been slowly unfolding this mystery he said can you see now what happened in the prefigure he he opened Adam as side took part of his flesh which was Adam to make Eve he said the bride has to be the word for he is the word she cannot stand on Creeds she cannot stand on denomination now he said you're predestined to the stand but here's what you stand on she has to she cannot stand listen on good behavior right right right I I'm not going to make it because of my behavior right good behavior comes because I've been redeemed in him but it's I'm not going to make it based on my good behavior it's not what I stand on I don't stand on on visions and dreams I don't stand on what somebody said I don't stand on somebody else's word I stand on the word of God as the bride we've got to stand on the word of God and that alone we we're we're we're not healed because somebody said you're healed or some we went through some prayer line that's good to go through the prayer line increases our faith but we're not healed because somebody said we're healed in the prayer line or we got some word of knowledge or something else we're healed because the Bible says we're healed by his stripes we are healed we're saved because he said we were saved right not because anyone else told us we were we could we could mimic being saved assimilate with other believers and just act like everybody else and say well I'm saved but if he ever says we're saved if we can ever get a revelation what he preach my batteries hey man we'll just keep going through mics till we find one that works look she's part of it she was taken from Christ I love she has see if this one's got any battery in it see it tells me how much when I turn it on three hours is that enough all right that'll be good brother see we don't stand on good behavior do we she can't stand on good behavior she has to stand alone on the word because she's part of it sounds better anyway she was taken from Christ and and this is where legalists get so confused because they're looking at Behavior not looking at the promise right we're looking at the behavior of the church or the behavior of the preacher or our own behavior that's not what we look at we look at the promise because if you can ever look just squarely at the promise your behavior will change it'll follow that and so he said to be sure he said that the whole Rapture amen the whole Rapture now Luther was a part Wesley was apart the prophets was apart he said just in the Revelation that they was making up the body feet toes arms and so forth until the head he said which we get to that in a few minutes he said that makes the entire Rapture he said it's the body of the word which is Christ it's the body of the word which is Christ he said outside of that you're lost he said I don't care how good you are what your relationship is what your fellowship is what your organization is you're lost outside of that word being in you he said if you abide in me the word my word abides in you he said then you ask what you will because you and the word are the same he has the pinenes he's got the rulership you're a prisoner to him we talked about that last week the world is dead you have nothing more he said you see the rest of the people living the way they do but yet you do not do it why you're a prisoner you're Yol to him and he said my yoke is easy how many believe that tonight my yoke is easy yolked with Christ with his word he said I do only that which pleases the father and if you can't believe that I am he then believe the word amen so we are the word because we come out of the word right just like he divided we're not him because that masculine part that type was left in him we are if we could say it that way the feminist spirit of God the bride part of God but it's still part of God does that make sense to everybody so you can't be lost if you if you're one that was there now now look how do we know that how do we know that I'm going to stop in Christ's minster of God revealed now and just dwell in this for just a minute how how does that word live how do we know that we become the word well by the the token by the baptism of the Holy Ghost 1 Corinthians 12:3 wherefore I give you to understand that no man speaking by the spirit of God call it Jesus a cursed no man can say that Jesus is the Lord but by the Holy Ghost so we must have the token in order to say that we're part of that bride body brother R said the token for the believer today everybody want to hear what the token for the believer today is I know people say well it's a tape or or it's a certain Doctrine but that's not what a prophet said it was the token for the believer today is the Holy Ghost not a blood you say well they got the Holy Ghost in Luther's time Wesley's time P yes they did but now that the fullness of the word has come the token for today is the Holy Ghost not a blood a chemistry but it is the holy spirit of God that is the token that God requires of the church today right that's what he requires that's that's how you know you're in that bride body is by the Holy Ghost he said God must see this token he must see it in every one of us and so we've been predestined to receive the token can we say it that way if we've been predestined to make it if we've been predestined to be part of that bride we've been predestined to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost you say well I'm I'm afraid he won't give it to me I'm afraid he'll hold it from me for some reason because of my pastor or something no you've been predestined to receive it you've been predestined to the adoption of children you've been predestined to the Token you've been predestined to believe the message of the hour you say what happens if I believe it for a long time and then I leave no you've been predestined not to fall right right and others may be able to maybe they weren't predestined but you've been predestined not to fall Hallelujah you you might fail even in your flesh but you can't leave that message why you were predestined to that stand you're taking amen now we find in Moses time there was a predestined group that come under the token pred destined Moses with a message to deliver the people and he predestinated the people to be delivered by that message and under that token they were seated in Heavenly places and we're coming around to where we started in Ephesians 1 nothing could harm them not even death itself why they were under the token they were under the token for the age which is the holy spirit Ephesians 1:3 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ so this is where in our position in Heavenly places this is where we're seated today brother B said that's currently that's right now that's not a future State that's a current condition yes brother BR said the word was made flesh yeah therefore you walked with him yes when you were in him Hallelujah when he was on the earth what a wonderful what a wonderful Revelation the word was made flesh therefore you walked with him when you were in him when he he was on the earth I I think this time of year ought to mean something to us church right because listen what he says he said you suffered with him right you died with him you was buried with him and now you are risen with him and manifested attributes of God sitting in Heavenly places already raised resurrected to New Life and sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus how could you fall you were in him then that's right you were in him when he raised the dead you were in him when he healed the sick you were in him when he died when he was buried when he raised again you were in him then then he sent back his Spirit on the day of Pentecost look he has blessed us in Christ you are blessed I know that's hard for us Brother wendle last year remember the sermon Friday night and brother wendle was struggling brother window Martin was struggling with his health and he's recovered since but but he was they didn't know whether it was heart trouble or something like that he was having heart uh chest pains and he was struggling when he was preaching that but he preached a sermon called I we are blessed you are blessed you just kept repeating that over and over we're blessed and I well well that's simple you go to a message meeting and hear we're blessed but do you realize that's what we actually are yeah every one of us are you say well I lost my dog today you're blessed right maybe something far worse than that but you're blessed you may lost some money you may you may not be able to make ends meat but you're blessed said but brother Ben I don't understand if I was blessed I'd have a better job if I was know you're blessed right now because you're not looking to material things you're looking beyond that you're looking to the Unseen you're blessed you're seated in Heavenly places you are so blessed that all things someone say all things work together for good to them that love God I believe that's me I know I love him brother Paul I may not perfect but I know I love him and those that love God are blessed all things work together for them for good to them that love God to them were the called according to his purpose for whom he did Forno he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called whom he called are you seeing your own name there whom he called them he also Justified whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we then say to these things not to pick on brother wle again but he's always saying what can we say about the service tonight well what shall we say then to these things if God be for us oh I love that watch we we could end every sermon with that if it was on if it was correction if it was on the Holy Ghost if it was on whatever it was what shall we then say to these things we we can end every every tape we listen to every time we read our Bible what shall we then say to these things if God before us who can be against us verse 32 he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us someone say all things I know we've read this many times before but just think about it in the context we come out of his body we were sep separated from his side we were in him oh my who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect we were justified in him Amen to charge the bride would be to charge God would be to charge Christ himself because we come out of his side who is he that condemneth it's Christ that died yeah rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of God who also maketh intercession for us you say well this this all means that if I'm Gods I'll never make any mistakes what who's he making intercession for then why why is he the advocate today why does that body and I know it's a very literal way of looking at it but why is that body laying on the altar in heaven if we don't need it sometimes amen oh we absolutely need it right we absolutely need it CU we make mistakes we make mistakes but he makes intercession for us who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation no distress no persecution no we we should answer these questions who shall separate us famine nakedness Peril sword yeah as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter he said yes you're going to be picked out for persecution you're going to be picked on but the fix is already in you're going to win in the end you might get all the way down I play chess and sometimes what I hate the most is playing a really good player and getting an advantage over him but knowing he's going to find a way to get me in the end because I'm just not that good so if you're playing a highly rated player they just have a way and I've watched I don't know if you've ever heard of Magnus Carlson he's a great chess Grandmaster he's a young man still but he's a Grandmaster maybe the best chess player that ever lived and he don't even care if he has an advantage he don't even care if you get him down by three or four pieces or so many points he doesn't even care because he knows Oh my he has confidence in his skill that he knows what the end of that game is like he's already programmed it in his brain which is a higher programming ability than even a computer he's already programmed what it's going to be oh my if we can only understand it's already been programmed what it's going to be we already know what the end is it may look like we're down it may look like you're down a few pawns and and a couple Rooks and a few Bishops but you got to understand it may look like we're down a few churches and a few preachers and and and a few people but just remember the end the fix is in yes sir the great mind that that did all of this he already knows what the end's going to be we're counted as sheep for the slauer sure we're going to have persecution nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for I am persuaded neither death nor life nor angels or principalities no devil no demon no government nor powers nor things present he said things that exist now or things that will exist in the future Hallelujah you say well Co God didn't know about co co was new and so he's been trying to catch up no he knew about Co that falls under those things to come right the internet that fell under those things to come right all the things we deal with today God already knew about it but none of these things amen like Paul said none of these things move me nor things present nor things to come nor height nor dep nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord why because we come out of his body we were in him and he we were separated from him but we're going back his great purpose is to bring us back into fellowship with him again so you realize then that you know I'm closing in just a moment but we can't be judged right we don't go to the white Throne judgment right we go to we go to the marriage supper and then we sit in the white Throne judgment right now how how is that possible how is that possible because I'm part of his body and the token in my life is proof of that it's proof of that that's why Satan wants to fight you so hard on whether or not you're saved whether or not you have the Holy Ghost right you noticed how hard he fights you on that some of you mature Christians you've been around for a long time and the devil's fought you for years right whether or not you had the Holy Ghost right right why did he why does he fight you on that yet you can look back at your life and see my life changed things are different now than they used to be right why does he fight you on that because he knows if you ever recognize who you are but the B said when the bride realizes who she is the rapture will go amen oh oh listen to me Church you you cannot be judged your your sins were already judged in that body you were part of him and the token that you have today the holy spirit in your life is proof of that say God help us God help us and said Lord I I want you to reveal that to me I want to have that so deep in my heart I know that nothing can remove me from the love of God would you stand with me musics go ahead and come I want to I want to try to sing that song he knew me yet he loved me for the joke could help me tonight you believe he he knew you you believe you were in him yes do you do we really believe that that means I if I'm a part of that I cannot come into condemnation there is therefore now no condemnation to them who are in Christ amen who are in Christ we are not only fellowshipping with Christ we're not only feeling his presence but we're in Christ in in a spiritual sense we are his body and even though we made mistakes and even though we failed and even though everything seemed like it was had gone wrong but yet he knew me but he loved me anyway I was a part of him he knew every mistake that I would ever make but I'm part of him he knew that I would doubt he knew that at times I'd make stupid mistakes but he loved me anyway and I'm so glad that he did I'm so glad that he loves me aren't you amen I'm of a special kind I'm a special kind because when he was on the cross I was on his mind was not only on his mind it was in his heart
