redeemed of the Lord say so amen you believe you're going to say so today whom Heath redeemed from the hand of the enemy gather them out of the lands from the East and from the west and from the north and from the south this is my testimony they wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way they found no City to dwell in hungry and thirsty their soul fainted in them then they Cried unto the Lord in their trouble and he delivered them out of their distresses he led them forth by the right way that they might go to a city of habitation and then verse eight oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness for his wonderful Works to the children of man it's Thanksgiving season I I think we ought to give the Lord thanks for all that he's done hey amen amen he's so wonderful to us today amen do

Worship You Lord Lord as we have a little moment this morning now just to approach your word we ask that you come Lord in a Divine Supernatural way and break the bread of life as only you can we love

Bibles to Matthew chapter 25 we just thank uh your pastor brother Ben for the opportunity to come it's good to be with you again amen we love each one of you dearly this this place is certainly um uh our family has some history here it goes way back my dad helped build the church and so it's it's good to come walk in My Father's Footsteps and stand and proclaim the same gospel that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever oh yes amen so just let's just read in our Bibles here uh in Matthew chapter 25 before we do I do bring greetings from our pastor Brother David meiri and the Saints there at Christian Life Tabernacle in Bedford Texas the scripture would read like this in Matthew chapter 25 and verse uh 1 through 7 it says then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be likened unto 10 virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom and five of them were wise and five were foolish they that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lambs while the bridegroom tarried they all slumbered and slept and at the Midnight Cry and at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps and all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps well it said all them arose and trim their lamps but you know out of all of those that Rose there was just a few that actually had oil if you'll turn in uh to Revelations chapter 19 for one more reading Revelations 197 would read like this let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife life hath made herself ready amen we ask a blessing upon the reading of the word you may have your seats I just want to read a quote here out of the Rapture the prophet of God would say the first thing come when he starts descending from Heaven there's a shout yeah what is it is a message to get the people together a message comes forth first now lamp trimming time rise and trim your lamps what what what was that the seventh not the sixth the seventh behold the bridegroom cometh rise and trim your lamps and they did some of them found they didn't even have oil in their lamp see but it's lamp trimming time it's Malachi 4 time what he promised in Luke 17 all those prophecies that it can perfectly set in order for this day in the scripture we see it living right there and in the The Rapture that brother brandham said the shout is the messenger getting the people ready and in time of evangelism he said the end time message is to get the bride ready and prepared for the Rapture what can it do according to Malachi 4 is bring them back to the faith that was once delivered to the Saints and what I want to speak to you a little bit this morning on is ready and prepared for the Rapture and I want to say this this preparation isn't always easy you know uh if you look at a prophet's life the way could be uh very hard the way that he's prepared and the the journey and the trials and and the way way you go you know this way is a rugged way it's it's the harder way you know character it it's a victory we we go through great trials and test but you know as Paul would say there in second uh Corinthians he say for our light Affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceedingly an eternally weight of Glory but we want to be ready we want to be ready within this hour that we're living in and just to give you a definition of preparation it's the action or process of making something ready for use or service or getting ready for some occasion it's a for a test or a duty and I just want to say that every single day we should be getting ready uh and preparing for the rapture we we should be promoting the Rapture you know Pro promoting means to advance to to put forward it should be on the Forefront of your mind and on the Forefront of your thinking everything that you you're doing everything that you're preparing for everything that you're getting ready for rapture rure should be on your for thinking Rapture should be on your mind Rapture should be on your heart Rapture should be in your conversation everything that you're you're doing and everything that you're working for it all should be for Rapture because because the bride has made herself ready oh the scripture says Rejoice for the marriage of the Lamb has come we should be rejoicing we we should be in a Thanksgiving we should be offering praise honor and worship for the hour has come this invisible Union of the Bride of Jesus Christ with the bridegroom is now here taking place on Earth in a union oh my what an hour what a time and we should be ready for the great coming of the Lord where these bodies are translated and we meet him in the air everything you should be thinking about should be Rapture come on you know you you hang around somebody long enough and and you you you you'll start to find out what they really believe and what they really think and and what's important to them and and what they spend their time doing right come on you know you get to spend a little time and maybe they can talk about this or that or you go hang out with them or you go into their home or you go to their workplace and and after a while you'll find out what's really important to them what they spend their time doing what what they want to invest their time in and and their efforts and and everything you know your your time has great value that's right you know I want to say that your your time is currency by which you make a purchase your your your time is extremely important what you invest in and what you think about you know I I I was thinking about that if if you make $10 an hour and and somebody else makes $100 an hour and you both work zero hours who made more money that's right come on you got to put the time in to get the value I want to say that you exchange your time for something that's right come on all of our time all of our effort the thing that we we we spend uh H uh thinking about you know Paul would say this in Philippians 4:8 we're very familiar say finally Brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report if there be any virtue if there be any praise think on these things you know Proverbs would say as a man thinketh in his heart so is he you know I I want to tell you there is a great battle going on for your mind Satan is constantly bombarding your mind and constantly trying to to press this place into your thinking and cause you to think about everything else but the Rapture come on he wants you to think about his news and his ideas and the The Cutting Edge of technology and and what you got to do for work and this that tomorrow and how you can save a penny there and how you can save a penny here and and how can I get a nicer car how am I going to get a nicer house and and I need to study and I need to get a better education and maybe I need to drive down to Little Rock for a career and and maybe it just ain't working out where I'm living and maybe I need to move to the big city just seems like I can never get on top of things I can never get ahead I'm always in debt I see other people driving nice cars and have a nice house and and I'm just sitting here in my double white trailer and and everybody else is blessed but I'm not blessed did your blessings come from a double ey trailer did your blessings come from God our blessing isn't here on Earth our blessing is beyond the river you have a mansion on the hilltop that's prepared for you what are you living for I'm not living for this world I'm not living for a house I'm not living for a car I'm living for my Lord Jesus Christ who paid for your sins who died for you that's what your blessing is he purchased all things for you that's what you should be thinking about you shouldn't be thinking about all the natural things and all the carnal things and how you can get ahead in this life I want to get ahead in that life yes sir I want to be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye yeah you know love thinketh no evil perfect love cast out fear this ought to be the things uh that's pertinent upon our heart and the things that we would think about as Jude would write exhorting the Saints to earnestly contend for the faith gr lord it's something we're fighting for yes sir something we're working for something we should be striving for every single day given our times and our efforts to advance the kingdom of God oh help us Lord thank you Lord just want to read a quote out of here a trump gives an uncertain sound the prophet of God would say that's one thing that certain God made a promise God is going to keep the promisen aren't you thankful for that how can this thing happen how can he get a bunch of people together with Rapture and Grace to go up I don't know how he will do it it's not my business to ask how he'll do it it's my business just to be ready for it he promised it's going to happen fortified his church by his word our business is to be ready for it I'm not exactly sure the day or the hour I'm not exactly sure how it's all going to be happen but I have a responsibility that I want to be ready for the change of this body and I want to ask what are we doing with our time what are we doing with our efforts what are we what are we doing every day are we actually preparing for this or we have we gotten to a place where we're complacent and I believe the message and I'm ready and I believe Malachi 4 and and so I'll just work and I'll get a job and I'll go to church and you you're just you're just wandering through life no different than any other denominational with a thought or an idea or a thinking that you're okay but this message got to be living it has to be be an action it got to be a life it has to be the person of Jesus Christ Living in you and through you oh living out to a dying generation seeking Souls that are lost there got to be something more than just some denomination some man's thinking some idea we got to be living for something we got to be constantly getting and ready for Rapture oh yeah how are you going to do it by his word oh thank you Lord Joshua and Caleb didn't know how they were going to do it come on they just knew God had give the promise when they went over and tasted of the good land and they came back with the evidences with the Holy Ghost and say look look at the land that God promised it's there let's go take it yes sir all of the other people were looking at how they were going to go do it well how are we going to be changed how are we going to be translated how how is this little we've just been wandering around in the wilderness with a couple buckets of Mana we don't really how are we going to be Steels chariots and iron and swords and big wall fent cities see they had got ahead and they started to look at the circumstance they weren't even looking at the promise but that's what Joshua and Caleb did they stood up and stealed the people said look we're more than able to take it look you are more than able to go into the Rapture you're more than able to have the change and translation of your body you're more than able to do and believe all things why because God gave the promise he promised it he said it he fortified You by his word so therefore it's going to come to pass yes sir how are you going to do it by his word how you going to do it by his word God promised God said so I think of Abraham Abraham didn't know about it you know God God told him hey you're you're going to be a father of many nations now he's getting old Sarah's laughing about it how are these things ever going he didn't know that God was going to change his body on Abraham didn't didn't know that well I let me let me tell you exactly how I'm going then it wouldn't have taken Faith come on sometimes we just want to take Faith out of the equation come on Lord I'll believe you if you just show me how it's all going to happen all right where's the faith in that come on well Abraham I'm going to make you a father of many nations and you're going to go you're going to go down into Egypt you're gonna you're gonna betray your wife and you know then the king's going to take and then I'm going to do this I'm going to do that and he's just going to lay it all out and then there's no faith in it come on sometimes we sometimes you're praying for an answer that you don't need I think the message has everything you have need of you need an answer from God I believe if you listen to the shout if you listen listen to the voice of God speaking to you in this age you will hear the voice of God to you for what you need to do for the hour that you living in and then praise God he has a dress wear and a five-fold Ministry and there's there's uh ones in the body filled with the Holy Ghost if you need an answer if God wants to speak directly through your brother and sister he'll do it but God has given us our word that we don't have to have it all mapped out what we got to have is faith in his word that says Lord you gave the promise you're more than able to perform it and we can stand there like Abraham as the scripture would say and Abraham staggered not at the promise of God because he knew the one that made the promise was more than able to bring it pass I'm so glad that I'm standing here believing the shout believe in Malachi 4:5 and I don't have to worry about my ability I don't have to worry about my flesh I don't have to worry about my past I don't have to worry about my failures and my complexes and everything that I've ever done to mess it up all my faith is in the word of God he said I was going in a Rapture he said I was his bride he said I was an overcomer he said I was healed and if he said it I believe it heavens and earth will pass away but there's one thing that will never pass away and that is the word of God I say what are you standing on this morning come on we're standing on the rock of Revelation heavens and earth will pass away but God's word will never pass away I say what do you have need of this morning that's good God give you the promise didn't he right by his stripes you're already healed thou can't believe all things are possible where is somebody you have a need this morning something you've been believing for oh come on let's start having an expectation may maybe you've been fighting a long time say brother Matthew I'm getting pretty discouraged I've been hanging on and and I'm starting to believe it's never going to happen don't give into that Voice come on that's a lie by his stripes you are already healed if thou can't believe all things are possible oh my son and my daughter they they've gone Wayward and they've rejected the message and now they're saying things they maybe that's so but God give you a promise yes sir I'm not looking at the situation or the circumstances I'm looking at the promise he said you in your house shall be saved then need need to tell that Old Devil shut your mouth I got a promise that me and my house will be saved I'm standing Upon A sure word of Prophecy and that word will come into manifestation whether it's in this life or the life to come I'm standing Upon A Promise yes sir that's how you start beating the Devil back that's what we need to do is we need to take the word of God and we need to start beating the Devil back come on preach look I I I believe the promise for the hour is Rapture that's right amen we're living in the hour of rapture and we should declare with our lives oh yeah our lives should be declaring by our works and by our actions oh yeah that we're living for Rapture this this there's a deep calling to a deep I got to be changed brother Ben yes sir H this this mortality has to put on immortality come on whether I go by the grave or whether I'm those that are alive and remain I'm living for that moment I'm living for that change come on we got to have a vigilance we we got to have an awareness about us that everything's fighting this di uhh from from Catching these Revelations that lays within the word the revelation of who you are that's right the revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of the church Satan's trying to keep you from digging in and getting Revelation and consecrating your life and laying in the presence of the sun baking out of the draws and all the greenness he wants you to busy yourself with the things of life where Rapture does not become the preeminent purpose and goal for you come on it's so easy to get distracted it's so easy for us to start to look off to everything come on but we ought to have the re resolve to say look I'm going in a Rapture today is Rapture sir tomorrow is Rapture every day is Rapture this is what I'm living for and I'm going to make myself ready and I'm going to be prepared for that hour and that moment I wonder are we making prepar ations what are you preparing for oh my I think it's important that we don't look so much at the Rapture as so much as an event but it's an unfolding the coming of the lord it's an unfolding you know the resurrection is not an event it's a person that's right well what did Mary say or Martha say to the Lord he he said I am the resurrection oh yes right she was looking to an event but she had the person of the Resurrection standing there in her presence don't you realize the person of the Resurrection is standing in your presence the person of the Rapture is here right now that can change your bodies in a moment I want to see Rapture is in you look if Jesus Christ was the word and he said I am the resurrection right and the resurrection was a person come on come on all right yeah but the prophet of God said you become the word as you receive the word and if the promise of the hour is resurrection if the promise of the hour is Rapture I want to say you are the Rapture oh yeah quit looking at it so much as an event but the very preparation that Readiness is something that's taking place on the inside of the believer as you come in a union with Jesus Christ you are preparing yourself you're becoming ready that you might be translated in a moment and and a twinkling of an eye and be changed to be out look the Rapture is in you oh thank you Lord you want to know where the Rapture is I'm looking at the Rapture come on you are the Rapture yes sir well if you want to go in the Rapture if you want the culmination of the Rapture and the changing of our bodies that behooves us to get ready oh yes get ready what are you preparing for oh that's good you know athletes and all these people what they they they get ready they prepare yeah that's right I mean if you look at the hours of preparation to the hours on the game field it's not comparison come on that's right you I I think there's a saying by some famous uh Chinese scholar who was a a a military uh uh leader I maybe not get it get it right the way he said it but he said you know people that will will win the fight they they they they prepare and they win the battle before they go to battle he said others show up to the battle and try to find out how they're going to win look I don't want it I don't want that I I don't want the trials and the calamities to strike and me finally get in desperation and say you know what God I'm not living the way I need to live and and and now this has happened and that has happened I better get my act together it takes those things sure sometimes we don't live right and God gots to put you flat on your back where you thought you had what you thought you had and you realized you didn't well that's okay it's a wakeup call God can deal with your heart but I say why why not right now why don't we get consecrated why don't we get sincere why don't we start to get real within our families and our lives and say you know what to this morning I'm going to rededicate my life I'm going to reconsecrate my life I you know I really haven't been living with that fervency and that desire I think back to the day when Jesus Christ came and he saved me and he delivered me from sin and now that the kids have come and marriage has come and I've kind of you know the busyness of life I realize I'm not praying like a to I'm not I'm not really seeking the Lord like I well that's okay we go through Seasons we go through Winters we go through Summers Springs and Falls but I say if you can just purpose within your heart this morning Lord I want to rededicate I want to be on fire I want to be ready I want to Proclaim Rapture to my neighbors I want to Proclaim Rapture to the workplace I want to Proclaim Rapture to the church I want to Proclaim Rapture to my family everything I'm living for is Rapture thank you Lord oh I want to go be with my Lord oh yes I want to read a quote out of Christ the mystery good prophet of God would say and remember we are now as his bride pregnated with his Spirit oh my the church bearing Children See pregnated by his spirit with his name burying his name bearing his life bringing forth the signs of his life evident with the pinenes evidence of his resurrection showing that he is not dead but alive forever more this eternal life and Vindicated vindicates to the world that we are alive in him how do you know because you're a church member because Christ is living through you so pregnated with his Spirit you're a prisoner to anything else you're confined oh myy the gospel confined to his word and all the children that you can bring forth is that oh my this is powerful all the children that you can bring for is that because you're a prisoner oh yes right are you a prisoner come on some of us are we have dual prisoners ship you're prison half the time to God and you're prison half the time to your flesh you know I had an odd dream a while back where I I I I I I it was so vivid and so real that it was kind of odd and and and striking because I I I all a sudden was in a in a jail cell and and there wasn't any windows I I couldn't even look look back and I felt like I couldn't even turn around the the only thing I could do was was look in front of me and and I was in this prison and there was this Corridor and it seemed like uh uh there was something in me just advanced just go forward you you can't you can't you can't turn around you can't go back this is a life sentence and and I was in there because I had killed a man and I thought this is this is a this is this is odd I I don't understand this but but but but in there there was this fulfillment there was there was this peace there was this direction there was this unction that that be be the this is the way things are now they they can't be changed and so uh where you're at uh you're a prisoner now so you got to take what's been given to you and now you got to start moving forward and I it was really striking to me I it was so vivid upon my heart you know many times well not many times but sometimes if you wake and maybe a dream is vivid or and then maybe it stays with you and maybe it can be a dream in such a way where you start to ask the lord lord uh uh uh what what is this what does this dream all mean and and and it come to me I realized that that the man that had died was my old nature oh my it it was the old person that I was but I had now become a prisoner to Jesus Christ and there wasn't even a window to look out to the things of the world there was no ability to turn around and go back to the past but now I had become a prisoner and the only thing there was to advance the kingdom of God the only ability I had was to go forward the only ability I had was to promote Rapture the only thing I could do regardless of my past regardless of my failures regardless of my state it didn't matter anymore that old man was dead the only thing mattered that now I become a prisoner to Jesus Christ and the only thing I can do is March forward by his word by his stripes by his blood just keep going just keep pressing just keep believing just keep going forward oh thank you Lord that's a prisoner no ability to go to the left or to the right hand I'm now a prisoner I'm a love slave to Jesus Christ Lord what do you want for my life what do you want me to say what do you want me to speak where do you want me to live what would you have me to do who would I speak to who would I Minister Lord I'm all yours Grant it Lord are we living like that oh come on preach when we wake up are are you in that type of Love relationship Lord what would be pleasing to you today Lord let me open of the scriptures speak to me I need to hear from you God lord is there a lost sheep somewhere that I can that I can find the brothers in the church the sisters in the church they're hurting Lord there there's afflictions upon them oh God may I intered on their behalf for you said the prayer of a righteous man availeth much Lord may may your righteousness aail through my prayer that they might be healed Grant it Lord Rapture is all I'm thinking about Lord to be with you for that F final unfolding of the Redemption of our bodies Lord that I want to be ready I want to be prepared oh yes Lord but you know that first Nature has to die that's good in Romans 74 he would say wherefore my brethren ye also are become dead to the law all by the body of Christ that you should be married to another even to him who is raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto God look we got to be bringing forth the fruit of the word come on we got to be bringing forth Children of the word we got to be bringing forth prophecies and Promises into manifestation and the fruits of the spirit into manifestation in our lives that's good prophet of God would say so to be married to the second Adam Christ this is out of invisible Union where just uh pulling my inspiration from that would be brother brandom's Thanksgiving message to the church so to be married to the second Adam Christ the word you must separate yourself by Death from your first denominational husband that's right cuz there isn't one of of them that can take all the word of God on well I never was in a denomination I was born in the message well you better watch out Prophet said you had to be separated and die to your first denominational husband if you start to reason with that and say well you know I never was in a denomination and I never come with that might be your denominational husband talking that might be that old you're talking well that really doesn't apply to you you know a denominational spirit's very religious oh yes it is a denominational Spirit oh sure you know religious spirit can make you think you're all right go to church say Amen go to the camps even trim your lamp I mean that's what my Bible said yeah there was 10 foolish and I mean five foolish and five wise and and the five foolish even trimmed their lamps but they didn't have any oil that's right we could be dressing right and acting right and going to the camps and mixing and mingling and going everywhere and we look all prim and proper and and I believe the message oh do you have you died have you died to that first husband have you died to that that first nature that's good look at the fruit in your life Let It Be sobering right now look at the fruit in your life oh my are you bringing forth oranges and tangerines and lemons is your life a mixed bag of fruit oh my are you kind of just grafted into the message bringing forth fruits of the message but you still have fruits of the flesh this isn't this is no in no way to condemn you this is to encourage you that's good that you can be bearing fruit of the word and all fruit of the word and you don't have to be bearing the fruit of the world you don't have to allow that old nature that carnal nature and the things of the world to be hanging on you you can be free from that but that first nature got to die look I don't want to be grafted in I want to be born into the message I want to be born again and filled with the Holy Ghost look if you're P if you're professing to be a message believer and you're not bearing the fruit of the word and you're living contrary to the me message of the hour the prophet of God would say that's spiritual adultery you you're claiming to be married to the Lord Jesus Christ but yet you're still in a union with the things of the world we got to come to a place Church where we die you got to die to that old nature you got to die to the flesh you got to bury that guy yes sir I say we got to get all the leav out yes get all the leav out come on let the Lord deal with your heart look we're here to be changed we're here to be ready we're here to be prepared on right you know if there's leaven in your life oh God you know if there's leaven in your home you know if there's leaven on your cell phone yeah come on prach you're paying subscriptions to entertainment come on preach you're spending your time entertaining the things of the world what's come on preach come on brother brandom let me see your cell phone let me look at your web search history let me look at the apps on your cell phone oh brother Brandon you got Netflix I didn't see that coming you have well never mind I was about to use that example but he probably would have thousands and thousands and thousands of followers on Instagram but he wouldn't be on it I doubt I'd probably be one of them so we just we didn't hear that one but right you know we we we we got to put things uh uh into reality the things that we entertain yeah the things we spend our time and our resources doing because that's but it's with that time you're purchasing something you're getting exchange is it promoting Rapture is are promoting the flesh oh my look you ain't supposed to have any Le in the home on get it all out amen if you keep falling to something keeps you you you keep running circles get it out of your life and say Lord I need to be filled with the Holy Ghost and the next thing that pops next time it pops its head up there will be another Power there that that'll make you more than an overcomer yes sir brother brandom says this an invisible union he says and that's my message to you Church you that's a union a spiritual union by the word I I'm I'm skipping many things but but but just we're kind of jumping you know being born again filled with the Holy Ghost uh uh uh uh catching the revelation of Malachi 4:5 Luke 17:30 we're now in this Union we we it's been the unveiling of God uh uh Christ The Mystery of God revealed we we've now been impregnated by his word we're bringing forth fruit of his word we're we're being ready for a Rapture at any moment in a twinkling of eye we're going to be changed that's what's on the Forefront of our mind he says you that are in a spiritual union by the word

Lord oh yes the prophet of God said don't dig him up come on if the prophet of God said don't dig him up that means the devil's trying to make you do it think about it now if the prophet told you

thinking about this anymore brother B what's going on in the church what's going on in my family I just need an escape oh I'll watch this this is this is this is a h this is a innocent enough this is how the devil digs up an old man oh it's just PG did the Holy Ghost give that rating come on come on preach that's good you're going to let an antichrist Spirit set the standard I love that well it's only PG it can't be too bad it's only PG-13 says who oh my says the Demonic possessed Hollywood of the world that's anointed by the Antichrist Spirit here kids watch this the devil said it's okay for your age group oh my hey this this is serious yeah we got parents in this message handing any kind of Disney any kind of thing to their children and feeding them any kind of garbage is that getting them ready for a Rapture it's probably babysitting your kids so you can surf the Internet well I didn't mean to get mad but come on I preach to myself come on preach are we preparing for a Rapture I don't want to dig up that old man I want to bury that guy I want to die say oh God come in by the Holy Ghost burn out all the drw Lord if there be any wicked thing in me Lord oh search my heart try me oh God I want to be ready I want to go in a Rapture Lord I want to be born again Lord I want to die to that first nature that old husband I realize I got a mixed bag of fruit I want to serve you Lord I Want To Worship worship you but I find out I'm still doing worldly things I'm still chasing after the flesh I'm still chasing after the lust of this flesh Lord but I want to die this morning once and for all I want to sell it all I want to be born again have we come become so revelated we don't need the Holy Spirit In Our Lives oh help us Lord as many are the sons of God they are led by the spirit of God oh yes when that devil starts to show you where to dig starts to show you your past starts to show you I want you to start digging right here you remember this situation you remember that I ain't taking that shovel devil matter of fact I got something to show you you see this devil this is the blood of Jesus Christ this is the token it's been applied and I have a Divine promise the death angel has to pass I've been born again I've been set free all of my sins have been washed and put under the blood I'm going to show you the there's power in the blood there's there's the life that's in the blood is now resident and it's living inside of me devil I'm taking my Mountain little by little I'm going to get the victory it's all mine he give it to me I can do all things I don't care about the wall cities I don't care about the armies God give me a promise it's my promised land and I'm here to take it give me my Mountain come on what are you believing for this morning you're believing for family you believe in for healing you believe in for the Holy Ghost you believe in for sanctification what is it that you're believing for you can do all things the Holy Ghost the enforcer of the word is here to bring it to pass oh Hallelujah yes sir praise His wonderful name oh thank you Lord get behind me Satan it's written that's right get behind me Satan it's spoken well do you know it's been spoken about you that you are The Virtuous bride of Jesus Christ you are Justified than you never did it in the first place oh thank you Lord what is all of that it's the shout it's the voice preparing you getting you ready to believe all things how how could we with with with that load of guilt or shame or as brother Brandon would break down the death definition of really what it means to be justified as though you never did it in the first place oh if you can allow the revelation of that this morning to strike your heart you never did it in the first place if that Revelation can strike your soul and you realize it's not based on your past it's not based on your failures it's based because he promised it and you never did it in the first place now you can make a step forward to believe for the impossible to believe for the change of your body yes you yes you you you're the one God predestinated you to manifest this message don't worry about those things you're Justified you never did in the first place but when you're always allowing the Devil try to bring up the past and try to point to your failures you're always there's always an unwillingness to step out on faith come on well me lay hands on the sick and yes you you're commissioned to lay hands on the sick and they shall recover on we're preachers we have a Divine commission we'll lay hands and pray and we'll cast out evil spirits but you also as a son and daughter of God filled with the Holy Ghost by Divine promise can lay hands on the sick and they shall recover and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out devils are we living below our privileges come on are we living in Earnest expectation for the translation of these bodies help us Lord Jesus as John the Baptist would begin preaching the prophet of God would say in the voice of the sign he would say that John who had the spirit of Elijah was a sign of Jesus coming he said it was a sign of preparation what did he start preaching repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand that's part of the preparation yeah that's right repent men and Brethren what what we do repent of your sins be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost the formula is still the same it still works yes you've repented of your sins be baptized yeah we're we're still proclaiming the gospel we we still have the same message what was what was Jesus first message he started to declare was you must be born again that was his first Doctrine if we ever get to the place as a church or as a body where we stop preaching you must be born again we've missed it yeah that's right come on and alls we ever preach is doctor and message fundamentals and and where this group got it right and where we're right and and you know we you know what no you must be born again and then when you get the inside teacher when you get the tutor he'll lead you and guide you in all truth and righteousness but repentance the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand it was a message of preparation as Matthew 3 would say for this is he that was spoken by the prophet Isaiah saying the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the Lord make his path straight look it's a voice of preparation this message is a voice of preparation to you yes it is right yes sir amen oh come on without it you don't even know how to prepare you don't even know what to get ready for you don't know how to get ready scripture says I John saw the New Jerusalem descending Out of Heaven as a bride adorned for her husband what was she adorned with she was adorned with the word with the revealed word with the third pool of the hour oh it was the message of the hour that has come to the bride to prepare you to meet the bridegroom in the air yes sir on the shout a message of preparation I like this word prepare if you you catch it out of uh uh uh uh the Greek or you look into the Lexicon it says to make ready to prepare to make the necessary preparations get everything ready yes figuratively drawn from the Oriental custom of sending on people uh before the King on their Journeys uh to level the roads and make them passable to prepare the minds of of men to give the Messiah a fit reception and a secure blessing oh now we're talking about being prepared behold the king cometh get everything out of the way make make the roads clear make imp passible is there anything that would hinder H the moving of the Holy Ghost Lord I want you to come father I want to get it all out of the way if there's any roadblocks if there's anything in my life that that's that's keeping me from going the in the King's Highway oh God come by the voice of Malachi 4 let's clear the roads let's make them passible that we might be able to give the Messiah a fit reception it's a voice of preparation oh yeah get ready Paul would say seeing we are compassion about such a great cloud of witness let us lay aside every weight and sin that so easily besets us and run with patience this race that is set before us I I like this meaning here patience it's the character characteristics of a man who is not swerved from his deliberate purpose and his loyalty to Faith and piety even the greatest Tri even through the greatest trials and sufferings thank you Lord we're running this with patience we're making the roads passable I'm not going to swerve to the right hand or to the left I'm not going to go on a detour I I hate detours that's right I don't know about you but I hate detours going out of the way because you missed your I did it on the way here I was on the phone and wanted to cut the back way I'm like okay well I missed my exit you know it's not too much farther go go up through uh Jonesboro and or come back through Walnut Ridge or whatever and then I'm talking to brother Ben and we're going to meet for lunch in Ash Flat and I'm like I knew I blew it so now I'm cutting through the sticks whining back and over through this that and the other trying to make up time why I missed my exit I was on a detour yeah come on I I I I had I had missed my turn because I wasn't following the instructions come on we we want to be like the scripture says I don't want to turn to the left or to the right I don't want to be distracted I want to stay the court course but you know detours aren't always a bad thing detours can be a very good thing yeah that's right especially if there ain't no Road sometimes we get frustrated oh man the road shut down well we can open it up you think you're going to make it through there it's only five feet of water and 10 feet of mud oh you know thanks for putting up the detour sign actually on second thought yeah and then when we do make a wrong turn or a left turn Lord graciously what son you're on a detour am but I gave you a promise I gave you Romans 8:28 at all things I love that promise I don't know about you but I rejoice in it you mean this all things you you mean the most wicked evil this or that all things right all things all things the devil tries to to start uh uh digging up that old man and all things no Lord you said that you work all things out for the good for those that are loved and called according to your purpose I'm so glad we don't have to do it on our own right oh thank you Lord no the Lord's not telling you you got to clear the road and you got to make it pass he's saying that I'm here to help you do it if if you want to do it if you want to get through that trial if you want to get through that storm if you want to get through that heartache that complex that besetting sin whatever it is I'm here you don't have to do it on your own maybe you've come to a roadblock maybe you need direction oh my well he's an everpresent help in the time of trouble yes he is Bible says call on the name of the Lord and you shall be saved yes sir what did he tell the Israel he said behold I send my angel before you he's going to keep you in the way he's going to make the way for you I think that's where we get ourselves in so much problem is is we try to do it all on our our own that's right we we get a little knowledge we get a little truth we get a little revelation we get a little bit of freedom and then we're off running on our own man I can do this praise God bless God's holy name and before you know it you're not being led you're not seeking the Lord you're not reading your Bible you're not praying everything the preacher says it's just remind you of something you studied yeah I remember that I remember that why don't you let God talk to you what's God trying to say where is he trying to lead you he he's trying to he's trying to show you this detour he's trying to take you he's trying to show you the road back to where you belong if you'll just quieten yourself if if you'll just start saying Lord I realize I haven't made the Rapture a priority I haven't made the Holy Ghost to Priority I haven't made your word of priority Lord I realize I've gotten off track I'm somewhere out here in the wilderness Lord I'm lost but Lord if you'll just take my hand this morning lead me back to a plain path because of my adversary the enemy would want to set a trap for me Lord but here I am oh God I need you to clear the road I need you to make them passible Lord there's an obstacle in my way but oh God take me through it clear it out of the way you'll just be willing to call upon his name this morning allow God to deal with your heart and move upon your heart and show you uh the erors of your way and and receive correction and rebuke those I love I rebuke and I chase them look God the voice is still crying out the bride behold the bridegroom cometh trim your lamps we got to get ready Saints yes sir but I think we've heard it so long and so often oh Jesus we become complacent no more urgency oh help us Lord you ask yourself some of the things that you've been doing would you want to be doing it when the Lord showed up come on preach we say that the Lord Is With Us yeah come on he's right here and just for an illustration while you're having your free time he's sitting right next to you do we do we really believe it come on huh come on yeah I say Lord I believe but help my unbelief come on preach I'll start entertaining something and like w with the Lord Jesus Christ right here really you're going to entertain that nonsense oh my and all a sudden something like oh yeah well do you believe he's I I do believe he's here well then when you start believing he's here you start to clean up your life Lord I'm sorry I that's right I don't want to do that Lord I give me strength to overcome that yes sir that's good prepared for the Rapture there is a preparation being made what are you preparing for we'll try to move towards a close I know everybody wants to eat what are you preparing for good look the world's making all their

they're prepped and they're ready and they're prepared I say oh if we can see that in the natural I say oh God I want to start having that expectation that uh that preparation that Readiness in my spirit Lord that you're coming in any moment that I've cleared out the roads I've made them pass I've got all the Le out I've made everything right I've repented of my sins I've cried out for the Holy Ghost I've been baptized Lord here I am I'm in Earnest expectation that any moment and the twinkling of an eye I can be changed so I must be about the father's business the prophet of God said that John 5:19 this harmony now exist the same Harmony that Jesus Christ had with the father now exist in the bride that you have thus sayith the Lord you know what he wants done with the word or you stand still why because the mind of Christ is in the bride and you're in a preparation oh thank you Lord oh my if we turn this corner we'll be eating dinner not lunch I'll ask the musicians to come and we'll find a place to to stop and provided way the prophet says so what if people are prepared in the wrong way what if soldiers went to the field not trained for battle but to go out and dance they might be ever so good dancers they've got to be trained to fight you might be ever so good a message believer you might be so ever able to have all the right answers oh yeah we become the theologians come on we can quote the quotes and we can quote the scriptures but where's the life Jesus where's the fruit where's the meekness where's the humility where's the patience oh [Music] God but to go out there and dance though they would ever be good dancers they've got to be trained to fight what if they went out there to some kind of affair and know not how to use their gun they would do little good so I think that the workers in the Harvest should be prepared to know how to train the people for the coming of the Lord for there's none of us but want wants to meet it that's right you know that's what Paul rebuked them as like you need to be teached when you should be teachers we've been in this too long we need to be able to now start taking taking others and properly teaching them and equipping them we ought to be out there in the Harvest workers of the Harvest we should be able to prepare others I want to get to the place where I'm prepared I'm sold out I'm so ready that that I I can now be that voice uh uh now living in me going out and and calling for hey the bridegroom's coming you need to repent oh oh let me let me share the gospel of the hour with you there's an overcoming power that God's given you you don't have to live the way you're living but if you're always on the defensive you're always just trying to overcome this or that you don't have to live like that anymore that's right maybe as they just start to play something I'm going to find a way to close but Ephesians says in 5:16 Redeeming the time because the days are evil we need to use our time Gathering up sanctification and Consecration and Oneness and unity we talked about the movements out there in the world those people are anointed they're sold out they're all in look at them they're marching down streets right I they're so sold out they make a fool of themselves they get flags and want and March for causes they're so anointed they don't even know what they're Marching for yeah that's right look at look at Israel and the condition of Israel yeah to think we're seeing the day and the hour where our nation and people in our nation are taking sides with murders I didn't I I mean I can't but the prophet said if this goes on for another 50 years the world will be totally insane that's right it's here insanity is here where people are Marching for people that murdered innocent babies and children and took hostages and killed them we got Governors and people in in in places in our nation that are taking sides with that yeah that's true but they've been anointed for it yeah but if they've been anointed for that that I say God has a bride on the earth yes sir if they're being an anointed for the tribulation come on God has a bride here that has been anointed for the Rapture you have been anointed for the Rapture you have been anointed for the body change just as Mary was anointed oh thank you Lord Hil Mary thou are highly favored among women for thou art going to bring forth the Christ the son of the Living God how can these things be the Holy Ghost will come upon you you're going to be overshadowed by the highest how are you going to go in a body change the Holy Ghost is going to come upon you you're going to be overshadowed by the highest you have been anointed to go into a body change how are you going to do it oh come on cuz he said so I don't know exactly how it's all going to happen but I know that you've been anointed amen let's all [Music] stand maybe I'll just read this quote just to help me close maybe as they softly play brother brandom just has this prayer here at the end of The Rapture it's a prayer so if you'll just bow as he we read this and just let let God deal with your heart you respond to this even though I I I just want you to respond to this if God's talking to you with your heads bowed and this in mind knowing that we're bowing our heads to the dust from which we were brought someday will return knowing that you got a soul in there that has to answer to God and if you feel that you're not just ready for the rapture and you'd want to be remembered in prayer just raise your hand oh Lord we have no place here to make an altar your altar is in your heart anyhow raise your hand God bless you God bless you mine you say I feel that I'm not ready I I want to be a Christian I've tried to be but there's always something missing I know that I'm just not where I should be have mercy God God I raise my hand be merciful to me oh Jesus now some 20 or 30 hands have been up already in this little group more is going up dear God you know what's behind that hand down there under that heart I pray dear God there's only one thing I'm responsible for and that's to tell the truth and dear God they want to be saved they want to really they don't want to want this something that's just some emotional some workup some denominational system some Creed some dog that's been added they understand father that it takes the pure unadulterated word of God everything else will pass away even heavens and earth but it won't if we be that word the Earth will pass beneath us but we can never pass away because we are oh yes that word the Bride of the room amen God bless you we just thank you for your attentiveness and we'll just turn turn the service over to brother [Music] be in Jesus oh praise God my yesterday sing it now all my sins are forgiven oh high been washed by God I just want to before we sing it again before we sing it I I just want to say this if if you're not ready this morning

of the word amen I want to think about these things that we do and as brother Matthew mentioned this morning a very sobering message I want to think about it is it helping helping me get ready or am I
