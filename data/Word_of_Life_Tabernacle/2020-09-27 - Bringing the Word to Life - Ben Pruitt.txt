you wash just in the water of the word and we're so grateful for that today lord so thankful for your blood god i pray that you would just move in in a mighty way this morning may your spirit brood over this service today and may your word just be real in our hearts and our lives lord there's so much going on in the world and so much going on lord in the church in different places lord sickness and things but we know or that you're the one who cleanses us still lord you're still the lamb you still hold these things in your hand and we thank you for that lord your power's not diminished but lord you've let us go through a test father so we ask you to come and just help us to pass that test lord by your strength father i pray for those that are still sick and especially for those with this virus lord today i i pray that you would just come and meet those needs lord or wherever they're at this morning or that if there's maybe feeling low this morning and i feel like nobody cares help them to recognize that you care lord and that you're right there with them even though they can't be in the house of god i pray granted now we ask in jesus name amen amen god bless you enjoyed that sir the song service this morning john chapter 6 and verse 63 we'll read that one verse while you're turning there continue to be in prayer for those who are sick sister vicky especially and i know they would appreciate your prayers she's been very sick and i know sister joanna's been sick as well and and they're nearing the end of their quarantine time but it's just hard to get over and it's not easy and we know that i know that from personal experience and but um i would say this about brother danny and sister vicki we really miss them when they're not here and we miss everyone when they're not here but i have a special place in my heart for them uh they're they played a huge role in us being able to be here today and have service the way that we are and and uh god god knows and so we're praying for them today and also for each of the others that are out and for the other churches in our area that are closed down today and and uh thank god that we've not had to do that for a while we don't say that we won't have to but thank god that we have we're able to be here today and and we should take every opportunity not lightly but don't take it for granted because god has allowed us to be here today for a reason amen and so we appreciate all of you appreciate our visitors today and different ones that are here and those many that are streaming still today and i pray that the lord would bless you richly wednesday night sister kledith had brother had told about sister mary being the growth not being finding more cancer and that was wonderful but there was a testimony wednesday night sister cletus had asked for prayer the previous wednesday for her eye i believe there was a little growth on her eye and and she said wednesday night as of wednesday night anyway that had disappeared and so we thank the lord for that i think god amen give him a hand god allows us to have these things so we know he is still a healer he's still a healer and so in spite of everything that's going on we know he's still god amen and the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man still availeth much hey man why because he's still on the throne not because the man is righteous but because he is on his throne and amen john 6 63 it is the spirit that quickeneth or makes alive the flesh profiteth nothing the words that i speak unto you they are spirit and they are life i pray lord without his blessing to the word this morning you may be seated i'm just a little bit distracted because i i feel this burden this morning for what i'm going to say and i want to make sure that i'm clear in what i'm saying you know it's because of the message of the hour that we know that the word is of utmost importance in our lives right you know everybody can stress certain things and you look at the denominational world today and they stress uh social outreach or or um they stress uh help helping people and that's good we want to help people as well every every opportunity that we get we want to help people but at the same time we realize that the most important thing is the word right and so now uh and even our services are structured that way where the word takes up the majority of our services because we know that the word is so powerful and so important and brother branham tells us that in the church age book he said i wonder if we are sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst and i want you to think about the word this morning and we'll read some more of this quote but i want you to think about the word is more than just a speech but the word is a person the word is a person and he's alive right he's alive the word is the person who is alive and and so you can't remove the life from the word right because the flesh prophet is nothing but he said the words that i speak unto you they are spirit and they are life now brother bible says let me give you a thought here how do we pray he said we pray in jesus name don't we he said every prayer is in his name where there isn't any answer he said yet in first john 5 14 we are told this is the confidence that we have in him so here's the confidence that we have he says that if we ask anything according to his will he heareth us so he said this is the confidence we have is in asking according to his will well how do we know we're asking according to his will right and so he said that we have confidence when we know we're asking according to his will it says he heareth us and if we know that he hear us whatsoever we ask we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him he said now we ask what is the will of god there's only one way to know his will and that is by the word of god so you might say this morning well if it's god's will i want to be healed well it is god's will right and when you pray for healing you always pray according to the will of god there are certain things that are in the word of god that are the will of god now you you may or may not receive your healing in this life you may be healed here you may be healed over there but you're going to be healed god's word is is calls for healing and so he said i'm the god that healeth all your diseases so now what is the will of god only one way to know his will and that is by the word of god lamentations 3 37 who is he that sayeth and it cometh to pass when the lord commandeth it not so if the lord didn't command it if the lord didn't will it it won't come to pass he said there it is if it isn't in the word you can't have it that'd be a good lesson for us to learn wouldn't it if it isn't in the word you can't have it and so he says and he said so we can't ask unless it's in the word and we can't petition or ask unless it's in his name he said there it is again jesus the name is the word will you can't separate god in the word there won all right now he said now then this word he is left behind on the printed page is a part of him right it's a part of him when you accept it by faith into a spirit-filled life right that's when it's a part of him is when you accept it by faith into a spirit-filled life he said that his word was life and because this is just ink and paper right it's just a book there's a lot of other books you could take the same paper and print any other kind of book on it but it's the words becoming life that make a difference now so there he said and you can't separate that now he said that his word was life in john 6 63 but that is exactly what he is because he says i am the way the truth and the life and if any man have not the spirit of christ he is none of his he said there it is he is spirit and he is life he said that is exactly what the word is that is exactly what jesus is he is the word listen so when a spirit-born spirit-filled man in faith takes that word into his heart and places it upon his lips he said why that is the same as deity speaking the same as if god spoke now he says every mountain has to go i wonder if we if we're sufficiently impressed with that today are we sufficiently impressed with the fact that when we take the word of god as a spirit-filled spirit-born uh son or daughter of god we take the word into our heart and place it on our lips that's the same as deity speaking and every mountain has to go he said satan cannot stand before that man aren't you glad you serve a god like that now so i want to show you and i want i titled this this morning bringing the word to life because i want to show you that the holy ghost or the spirit and the word are one of the same in the sense that you can't separate the two because if you separate the two you have something that's not what was at the beginning you have something that's not original something hybrid now so jesus said the words that i speak unto you they are spirit in their life and i want us to think about that what's the difference between the word and the spirit can you have one without the other and as i said i've made plain to you that i believe that you can't separate the two though people attempt to do that and they say i have the word but if you had the real word you'd have the spirit you say i have the spirit but if you had the real spirit you'd have the word right and so that's why brother branham talked about a person says i'm full of the holy ghost but there's certain things you won't believe or obey in the word how can you reconcile those two things because the holy spirit will only anoint the word now now he said in the beginning it was not so now in genesis 1 and 1 it says in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters the spirit of god and that word moved is brooded he brooded over the face of the waters the spirit of god brooded like a a bird would in a nest over the upon the face of the waters and god said let there be light and there was light now the spirit of god was the word of god because it's the logos that come from god and the spirit of god brooded on the face of the waters and god said let there be light huh so the spirit spoke the word and when he did it brought it to life and life is what we need more than anything else we need that that vitality that life of god because in our own life we'll mess up sure we will our flesh profiteth nothing if jesus could say that about his flesh huh what about ours he was the virgin born son of god what about ours huh that was born in sin shaping and iniquity he said the flesh profiteth nothing paul puts it this way he says oh wretched man that i am so it takes life brother brown says if i had the spirit of beethoven in me he said i'd write songs i'd write music why because that's what beethoven did he had that that nature he had that that those potentials to write music so that's what i would do because i'd have his spirit and if i had the spirit of christ in me what would i do i'd do the works of christ right and so the spirit and the word come together and bring to life bring life into the written word now brother brown says he was god the logos the word that went out of god he said when it began to brood upon the earth and it brought forth marine life he said when the spirit of god the logos the word which god said let there be there went the logos which is the word now he takes it from john 1 1. in the beginning was the word word was with god and the word was god right the word was made flesh and dwelt among us he says later so so we know that the word was the logos which brooded over the earth but the bible says that the spirit of god moved on the face of the waters you see you can't separate the two right you can't separate the two you can't say well i i don't follow the word but i believe i have the holy ghost or you can't say i i have all the word but not have the holy ghost the two are the same are you with me now it's the same god now and he says there went the logos which is the word and the word begin to he said because all this was in the logos he said the whole word of god the whole bible for every age think about that the whole bible for every age was in the logos and as the logos began to breathe upon the earth he said there came marine life and building up bird life on up to animal life finally there came something in the representation or looked like the thing that was brewing it brooding over it god a man in the very image of god he said that man fell like the seed has to fall and then god began to brood over that after the fall he brought up a enoch he brought up elijah he brought up a moses he brought up prophet after prophet trying to restore that image again and finally upon the earth came the genuine image of god himself again which was god the logos made flesh and dwelt among us he said now that same logos has a part he's got to be a bride and the same he's got a bride he said and the same logos this word that cannot be tampered with is brooding over the churches today amen then people people just misunderstand they say well the pillar of fire is gone well that vindication of a prophet was one thing but we have the brooding of the holy spirit over the church we have to or there's no life right if the spirit cannot brood over the church there's no life so that logos that that word is still in the churches today brooding over the churches today trying to bring back the word to its full manifestation amen now whenever so whenever you see what seems to be a move of the spirit but it doesn't agree with the word or whenever you see what seems to be the word but it doesn't have any life in it it wasn't so from the beginning right because that was christ the logos the anointed word all right that's how he works in the church and that's what we have since the day of pentecost is christ among us now look it's a hybrid satan has perverted it from the original it's like a mule right and brother brown talk tells us a lot about mules mule has characteristics he he's stubborn i don't know how many of you have ever been around mules i've not been around very much but the times that i have you know you've seen that a mule has a reputation for being stubborn he's untrustworthy they say that a mule will wait his whole life to to kick you one time he's never tamed completely he'd just sit there and wait by this time so he can kick and mules can kick sideways just characteristic of a mule so they can hurt people that shouldn't you know wouldn't be able to be hurt by a horse and the mule is a hard worker and brother branham taught us that you can go find these things in the message i didn't bring all these quotes because we'd be here for hours but but brother branham talks about how that mule is a hard worker and he outworks the horse he outworks the donkey he just works constantly but he's stubborn and he can't reproduce he can't he can't reproduce himself again he is the product of something now he has some characteristics of the horse he has some characteristics of the donkey but he can't reproduce either one you can't take a mule and make a donkey you can't take a mule and make a horse and you can't take a mule and make a mule right he's the product of the intervention of man are you with me now he wasn't so from the beginning he has the word without the spirit or the spirit without the word he he's what we would call a denominational system he just can't get it all together he's the offspring of a male donkey and a female horse so no matter how much he looks like a horse his daddy is still a donkey right now you know something interesting about mules that i found out is they eat less than horses and people like to keep them because of that because they eat less that's true of mule believers too uh-huh and there are certain scriptures as i said because of the mule's characteristics that the mule can't fulfill look at genesis chapter 1 and verse 24 god said let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind huh let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind cattle and creeping thing and beasts of the earth after his kind and it was so and the mule says i can't bring forth after my kind and so the mule is stuck in a constant state of being unable to fulfill the word of god so he just changes the rules are you with me now uh and this is a problem and go back and listen to brother branham as he is he talks to the pentecostal church and why is it so hard to live a christian life why some people can't seem to keep the victory all the sermons that brother brown preached about that and the word that was brought to us what's he trying to tell them there was emotion but no life or there was fundamentalism but no life and so the churches could only produce more churches there's nothing they couldn't do what god said do they could not bring forth after their kind they just all they could produce was more mules which is a combination of good and evil now the mule can't do that he says i know what the word says but but you don't realize i can't do it huh well it just makes you dig down don't it aren't you glad that you didn't you're not the product of a man's intervention right because if you were if all you have is so what some man told you to be if all you are is what somebody made you if i could form you as a pastor and preach you up and and bring you down make you into something that resembled me all you'd be is a mule right if i could take my ideas and put them with the message of the hour and somehow put that that together and make something out of you it's a mule huh if a pastor could take whatever whatever he wanted and and bring it all together and put that with his own ideas no matter how much as long as his own ideas are there with it it's a mule so the mule it's hard for him to live a christian life and i'll say to you today if it's hard for you to live a christian life there needs to be a birth that that brings that seed to life which is how you know that there's a thoroughbred christian there's a gene that goes back to the beginning why because there's something there jesus said my yoke is easy my burden is light see cults and just excuse me for being plain that's not in my nose but cults take the work from god and try to control the environment that people live in to the point where that what you are is the product of the cult they control your actions your deeds and everything about you that's not what the message of the hour does the message of the hour says here is the word if you can receive it if you can receive it here it's the word and what does the word do the word changes you from the inside it makes you become what you are it doesn't make you something that you're not so if you if you hate living like a christian if you just seem like you it's hard for you to well i wish i didn't have to live like this i wish i didn't have to keep these rules remember that that's what the mule says but there's got to be something inside of you that goes beyond that that said lord the flesh may hate it but there's something in me this is me this is who i am this is where i belong i don't want nothing else in my life but to sit and listen to the pure word of god now look the problem with the mule is that his as i said his birth as a result of man's interference mules are not known to exist in the wild because wild donkeys and wild horses don't live together but man brings them together and mules are it's interesting because they started breeding mules i got this where you could see it this is from the american mule museum because it's almost unbelievable but mules were first bred in in nicaea in turkey that's true it's where mules come from it's from nicea and i'm not trying to make anything spiritual out of that but that's the truth well mules spiritually come from nicaea from the nicene creed it's the same same place where they had the the night seeing council and so they reading a mule it brother branham says when the pentecostal church he said two groups they separated he said one wanted to stay with the word the written word others wanted a classical church he said it was during the time of constantine's reign and constantine was not a religious man he was even to begin with but he was a politician that wanted to unite so he looked at this and said well i like some of the things the thoroughbred does i like some of the things that the the pagans do so we'll just bring them together and make a meal he started a breeding program that's what he did he's making mules and it turns into something that's completely anti-word and antichrist because of the way he brought it together now because it takes both the word and the spirit to bring life now brother brown said he was he was a politician that wanted to unite half of rome was christian half of it was pagan so he adopted some of paganism some of christianity to a classical group and they made up their own religion but a made-up religion won't get you into heaven a made-up religion is not going to do anything for you all it's going to do is bring you down now so as i said it takes the word and the spirit to bring life in luke 1 and verse 26 let's look at this familiar story of mary as the word is about to be born in her and through her now in the sixth month the angel gabriel was sent from god into a city of galilee named nazareth to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was joseph the house of david and the virgin's name was mary and the angel came in unto her and said hail thou that are highly favored the lord is with thee blessed art thou among women when she saw him she was troubled at his saying cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be or greeting the angel said unto her fear not mary thou hast found favor with god she couldn't tell you how but she was chosen amen amen she was chosen before time to do what she did now he says blessed he said the lord is with thee blessed art thou among women and i backed up a little bit he said fear not mary for thou hast found favor with god verse 31 behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shall call his name jesus now it says he shall be great he shall be called the son of the highest the lord god shall give unto him the throne of his father david he shall reign over the house of jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end and said mary unto the angel how shall this be seeing i know not a man there's nobody here to start the program to start putting the mule together how shall this be without the interference of a man and the angel answered and said unto her the holy ghost should come upon thee amen how are you going to have a church without the interference of a man the holy ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee amen he'll brood over thee he's going to produce something in your life he's going to bring life to the word amen he said therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of god behold that cousin elizabeth sheath also conceived a son in her old age and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren for with god nothing shall be impossible amen with god nothing should be impossible and mary said i love this behold the handmaid of the lord be it unto me according to thy word so then the angel departed from her now one of the mysteries that brother branham brought us was that that happened without sensation she didn't feel any different oh if we could just recognize some people get all tangled up because they're looking for something that's not scriptural there was no sensation in this the sensation came later are you with me now the overshadowing of the spirit was without sensation but it produced a life she felt it only after it began to produce the word in her body but she believed it before she felt it and she received it before she felt it are you with me now brother brown said now mary could have waited until she had some kind of a sign that she was going to be mother and you could wait after the meeting's over until you feel that you can move your crippled leg just a little better or you could hear a little better out of that deaf ear or the cancer seemed to be that it wasn't bothering you so much he said that's not taking god at his word to take god at his word is to hear his word and accept it and start rejoicing with it so just because mary didn't feel anything doesn't mean she didn't rejoice are you with me now she didn't have to feel something to rejoice she didn't have to feel something to worship god why because the word came to her and she knew if the word came to her that that same god who brought the word to her would anoint that word to produce life amen amen so the word produced life in her now and brother brown says we could see 500 rush to the altar tonight which would be a good sign then that the revival is going to break he said but we don't have to have 500 at the altar we just have to take god's word for it and start rejoicing amen so we're waiting for revival and i know that we need revival sure we do say well i don't god bless you i'm gonna come hang out with you for a couple weeks but i do all of us do from time to time we need revival we just need to sense that that brooding of the holy spirit in our midst we need we need to have that we need revival when when people just can't seem to do right and live right in things it's revival that changes those things it brings life but so we need revival not a worldwide shaking revival but a personal revival we need revival but you say well i'll get the revival when the 500 come to the altar but then when i see people start coming back to church they'd all have revival but he said before the 500 come to the altar before you begin to feel the baby move before you have any sensation before you have any any any feeling or anything like that you believe god's word god said he would do it do you believe that this morning god said he would do it if god said he would do it he will do it nothing can change that he will do it so she took god in his word and said be it unto me according to thy word he said something will happen he said that brings the word to life as we water it with praises that's why some gardens are so dry because they never get watered with praises if your life is just dry and you need you need you say i need that move of the spirit we have the word of god he said behold i show you mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye that's the word of god and we can be to be like mary and say be unto me according to thy word be it unto me according to thy word something will happen what brings that word brings the word to life as we water it with praises he said what makes the seed grow water what makes the word of god grow is the praises of god hallelujah amen not because we got worked up not because somebody stood here and pumped us and pumped us and bumped us but because we we accepted the word and the word says i can be born again the word says i can be healed the word says i can be i can be saved the word says my kids will be saved the word says that i make it and it doesn't matter what coronavirus says or what the world says something else says the word says i can be healed the devil says i want to die but the word says i'm healed the devil says i'm going down the word says i'm going up you with me now now brother brown says when jesus told them to wait in the upper room or the city of jerusalem until they was endured with power from on high that word fell on their ears and they was in the temple continually praising god day and night before they ever felt anything he said what was they doing watering that promise and all of a sudden there came a sound from heaven like a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting he said the word was being watered and it took life and started growing he said you're wanting a revival could we say amen to that today you're wanting a revival everybody says they want one but are we willing to do what it takes to get there you're wanting a revival start watering the word the promise he said that makes me feel religious myself if you want to come out of the wheelchair start watering the word if you want to come from that cancer start watering the word amen so now so we know the holy ghost brings life to the word that is god's provided way and brother branham teaches us that and there is only one way provided by god for anything he says you are born into the kingdom of god how by the holy ghost that's god's witness he gives witness by the word of god that we've passed from death unto life because we are in the kingdom of god that's god's he said god needed a leader for the church i love this because with alan it takes some of the pressure off god needed a leader for the church he didn't educate a bishop neither did he send a high priest or a pope or no one else but he sent the holy ghost why did he send the holy ghost because a man will die and their systems die and everything else but the holy ghost is the eternal god he cannot die so if god builds the church if the holy ghost is the leader of the church then if something happened to me tomorrow the holy ghost still leads the church the leader of the church is not left leaderless are you with me now because the holy ghost is the leader of the church and what is he he's the word it's not just a feeling he's the word made flesh lit alive now he says he amen you give them an eternal leader you give them an eternal leader we look at those that have gone on look at brother branham and think well i wish i could have benefited from being near him i do i wish he was still here there's some questions i'd like to ask some things that i'd like to hear from god's prophet on but he left us with what the word when the holy spirit comes and anoints that word in our lives he gave us an eternal leader amen i can't go back to brother branham and communicate with him about the things we need to communicate with him about because that's spirit spiritualism communion with the dead is spiritualism so we can't go back and do that but we need somebody to guide us how can we guide us while we look at the word and then let the spirit anoint the word the prophet brought and the word we find in the scripture what happens he said there's something to guide them to tell them what to do how to live very bad how to meet the public you think god don't care how we meet the public how we act around people as i said a couple of sundays ago it's everybody's worth something everybody's worth a smile everybody's worth being kind to he said but what does the holy ghost do the holy ghost tells you how to meet the public how to meet the fierceness of the day how to combat sickness it's a better plan than ours brother joe joe and i had a plan to combat sickness but i don't think it worked very well he said but how to meet the fierceness of the day he knew we need to know how to meet the fierceness of the day so the prophet came and gave us the word and the holy spirit came to anoint that word and make it flesh don't have one without the other look the logos he come in word for him again so that we could see what it was like for a man to have the word to be the to become the word in his life and then we become the word now look that's our eternal leaders the holy ghost how to meet the fierceness of the day how to combat sickness how to combat this how to combat sin how we gonna overcome it it's virtually impossible in the world we have today to live without the influence of sin virtually impossible and i've talked to and especially since coming here and i not just you people are any different from any other people but just taking this position i i've realized that people can talk themselves into anything they can talk themselves into anything and so you have that influence constantly of the world telling it's okay it's okay it's okay brother branham said that that was the the demons of the euphrates river he said that would attack the bride and and we those are the ones that bring on the squeeze by the way we think about the squeeze and maybe there will be a time when we're running from the government but look when you look at running from the government what we're running from now is spirits that say it's okay go read pieces of the trumpets brother adam talks about that he said tell them it's so they tell they tell the bride it's okay you don't have to do that you don't have to live that way and see if we didn't believe in the holy spirit if we didn't believe that god could keep his church there would be no hope because the influence of the darkness is so strong there would be no way to overcome it but the holy ghost comes and teaches amen amen how to overcome these things brother brown said man has drawn all kinds of ways of joining this and creeds of this and documents of this baptisms of this every kind of sensation little quivers funny feelings everything else but it still remains the holy ghost is god's provided way for his church do we believe that today thank you for staying with me today i appreciate it look he said the holy ghost is god and god is the word the holy ghost is this word made full vindicated the holy ghost is the thing that brings this promised word to life he said you say i've had a feeling if it don't vindicate this word forget that feeling he said well you don't understand i'm in love if you're in love with somebody other than your spouse you've got a problem unless you're not married yet and then you better get married but see satan can make you feel that way your your flesh can trick you your heart even is deceitful you say i've had a feeling but if it don't vindicate this word forget that feeling they say well i've done this i've done that i've been baptized this way that way i don't care what you've done if the holy ghost is on you this word is vindicated through you well it makes the rubber meet the road doesn't it but you remember it was the prophets of baal who come out there and danced and had emotion and everything else and got all around and did it all that they did and cut themselves and everything else but couldn't produce nothing but elijah stood there with a simple prayer to god and god anointed it and god brought the fire from heaven what was it what was the difference the holy ghost vindicates the word amen the holy ghost still vindicates the word so you say well i don't feel the holy ghost believe the word amen it'll come right with it are you with me now now he says if the holy ghost is on you the word is indicated through you because jesus said these signs shall follow them that believed all the world and every creature amen god's provided way see it's obedience to the word that allows the spirit to dwell in the believer and bring that word to life now look you said being obedient now you think well being obedient means that i just have to find every little letter and every little thing and find out what the word teaches about short sleeves and find out what it teaches about all these things and jewelry and all these things then i'll try to make sure i follow every word that brother branham said and every word in the scripture no that's not what obeying obeying the word is when you get a revelation of something you follow it you believe it it's something that comes in your heart it can't be just something you do from the mind and being obedient to the word is realizing that you can't do it realizing you can't do it i need that that spirit that brooded over the earth i need that logos that brooded over the earth to bring the the chaos to life the earth was without form and void it was in chaotic condition just like many people's lives are but i need the word i need the holy spirit and the word together to brood over me so that i can come up i can live so what is obedience to the word okay i obey what am i going to obey i'm going to obey what peter said when he gave the prescription for how to receive christ repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sin you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promises unto you and your children to them that are far off even as many as the lord our god shall call what's he saying he's saying that that this is how you obey god not by going to church four times a week fasting and praying and doing all those things those things are wonderful but you obey god by coming according to god's provided way and obedience to the word allows the spirit to well in the believer look at jesus when he come to john in the water and he says he said john said i need to be baptized of you he said but we have to fulfill all righteousness what happens the spirit of god come down like a dove and dwelt on him now acts 1 and 4. we might ask this question why were the disciples in the upper room why were they there well it's because jesus said in acts 1 and 4 being assembled together with them commanded them that they should not depart from jerusalem but wait for the promise of the father which saith you have heard of me for john truly baptized with water but you should be baptized with the holy ghost not many days since so they're there in obedience to the word they received the word but the brother said it fell on their ears when they heard it they obeyed and so they were gathered there for that reason why are we here this morning now think about that why are we here and i know some many that would want to be here are not able to be here this morning but why are you here why are you here why are you watching you know you could watch a lot of things you could be on facebook and go down you want to go down facebook watch and and go through all the all the reality shows and everything else you could be watching that this morning but some of you are on facebook watching the church some of you are on youtube watching the church and you say why the service this morning why am i watching why are we here we're assembling together right this is our church nothing wrong with any other church but this is where we go in the house of god so we assemble together why because jesus the word said where two or three are gathered together in my name there am i in the midst of them amen what is it the holy ghost in you makes matthew 18 20 live hebrews 10 25 not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as a man or some is but exhorting one another and so much the more as you see the day approaching what is it the holy ghost in us makes that word live amen now i asked you this morning when he promised them he promised them that when they were assembled together he commanded them they should not depart from jerusalem but wait for the promise of the father was that promise good did he fulfill it then i'm gonna ask you this is this promise as good as that promise if it's not then god don't keep his word huh and he said how long is this promise good to the promised unto you and to your children all that are far off even as many as the lord our god shall call he said if you'll meet together if you'll go to the upper room if you'll stay in jerusalem if you'll if you'll be there waiting i'll anoint that place with my presence with my word so we don't have to work it up or pull it down or anything else he said he would be here and i want to testify to the faithfulness of god i want to testify to the faithfulness of god i've often thought about what moses said when he took the children of israel and he said lord he said if you don't go with us don't take us up and i've often thought that way when i was preaching but i can i can attest to the faithfulness of god i remember brother brown saying that that every time he said i don't know if he'll come but i'm waiting on him he said he's never failed me yet what was that the faithfulness of god and then he would stop and say he's here and i can attest to that faithfulness because every time i've walked through the pulpit i may be sick i maybe need myself i maybe may have had problems and different things going on but every time i've stepped into the pulpit he's met me there you see you could say the same thing not because you felt it but because the word said so every time i come in sincerity and gathered myself with believers and prayed and called out to god god met me there there's not a time that he didn't meet me he may not have given me everything i wanted but he gave me what i needed is this promise as good as that promise if it isn't he's not god now he promised to bring the word to life if we believe the word enough to be obedient to it that's why brother branham if you go and study the token message brother branham over and over he says he says now he says it's not enough to believe it you think wait a minute you have to believe it he said it's not enough to believe it but just to simply say i believe it's not enough because you have to believe it enough to be obedient to it and if you really believe it you'll be obedient to it but brother branham hammers that he said to be to just say to believe it is not enough he says he's because he takes this he said the covenant by itself he said the covenant is made null and void without without the blood on the door so he said the covenant was there to the israelites they were god's people but without the token being put on the door it was stolen void it was no good now in the token sermon brother brennan said and i believe this is the one he preached after the one at jeffersonville but he said when he said you must be born again he said that don't mean jump up and down at the altar that don't mean walk back there and shake hands with the pastor i don't mean all this foolishness that we've seen done it don't mean putting your name on a church book it means death to your first being and life to the second being it means that the blood has been applied and you're identified by the life of jesus christ and if he be the vine and we be the branches the life that's in the branch is also from the vine it'll bear the fruit amen he said if that first branch come forth the branches out of that vine that wrote a book of acts behind it if that branch ever puts forth a vine puts forth another branch they'll write another book of acts behind it amen he said because it's the same life if one of your great vines out here brings forth blue grapes if it puts forth another branch it'll bring forth blue grapes he said and i tell you today we got so many grafted vines into it with denominations and creates and things yet any citrus fruit grafted in can live in that vine but it's bearing the wrong fruit he said what we need today is another baptism of the holy spirit and i watch people i've heard this quoted many times but not very many people quote what we just read in front of it he said don't mean jump up and down at the altar don't mean to walk back and shake hands with the pastor what we need today is another baptism of the holy spirit and have the real power of god that identifies the works that jesus christ promised for this day not so much as that day this day the promise that he made here he said that was what he promised there he would pour out his spirit now he has promised it again in the last days and what he would do he said strange that we can always look back remember last week's sermon we can always look back but you can never look ahead he said that's the way with man he's always saying glorifying god for what he did do praising him for what he's going to do ignoring what he's doing he said that's always the way of man it's still the same thing and then he says full obedience to the word brings god the word eternal in you and that is the token hallelujah he said when the word is in you it's christ in you i want to close in just a moment but i want to get to this see the holy spirit bringing life to the word removes tormenting fear from your life some of you have experienced that you know for some folks it's a scary thing to come to church it is i read a story once about teddy roosevelt his mother's name was midi and he was just a child he went to a church called madison square church and for a while he refused to set foot in that church without somebody right there with him he was scared to death of the church building and so his mother kept trying to find out why and he finally told her he said well he said there's something in the dark he said it's in the dark corners of the church ready to jump out at me and she said well what is it he said it's a zeal zeal z-e-a-l a seal and she said well what do you mean a zeal he said well it's probably a animal like an alligator or a dragon but she said well how did you learn about it he she said well he said well the preacher read about it out of the bible a zeal and she began to read him passages where from the concordance where it talked about zeal and finally he said oh that's it and it was john 2 17. where his disciples remembered that it was written the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up lazier was going to get him some people are that scared of church as if the zeal is going to get you but that's not what we come to the house of god for amen we have a better word a more sure word of prophecy you imagine how scary it must have been in the old testament to come to god that if if the high priest didn't do everything just exactly right he walks inside the holy of holies if he didn't do they put bells on him and if he didn't walk just exactly right where the bells rung right they dragged him out what a fearful thing that it was amen but brother branham talks about the token being the sign of full obedience and he says when we receive the token now he's not saying that the sign of full obedience is fear is gone the sign of full obedience is the token he said but fear is gone why because the holy spirit has brought life to the word and the word if they don't say the zeal of thine house is beating me up you look at that oh i'm scared no what does it say it says you're my bride you're my wife i i'm i'm right there with you amen the word changes from what you perceived it to be to being something that is for you not against you are you with me now when the word comes to life in your in your heart the word begins to before you you don't come to church and just oh i hope the pastor does it doesn't touch on the thing that i'm doing i dread coming and it brings such a fear and a condemnation people come to church and just oh i'm afraid i'm afraid i can't make it i'm afraid i'm not making fun of you i know it's real but what you need is more of the life of christ what you need the brain said strive for that strive to keep that life in you because when you don't have that life you're afraid but the blood speaks better things you have all the legalism you want to the blood speaks better thanks amen amen hebrews 12 18 says for you are not coming to the mount that might be touched and that burned with fire nor into blackness and darkness and tempest and so many people come to the message that way oh i come to the word that way there's blackness there's darkness there's tempest he talks all about how bad i am but that's not what we come to are you with me now that's under the law sure it's the schoolmaster to bring us to repentance but that's not what we have come to and he said in the sound of a trumpet of the voice of words which voice they that heard and treated that the word should not be spoken to them anymore they said don't don't let him speak why did they cry that don't let god speak like moses speak why did they say that because they couldn't endure it verse 20 for they could not endure that which was commanded they just couldn't live it they couldn't do it because of fear fear i won't be able to do it they couldn't do it he said if so much as a beast touched the mountain it'll be stoned or thrust through the dark how am i going to touch it here's the mountain of god but how am i going to touch it if even an animal touches it they die it's so terrible it's the sight that moses said i i exceedingly fear and quake this god's prophet who god spoke to lip to ear but he said i exceedingly fear and quake he said but you are come i hope we get a revelation of this today what as david said we're come to mount zion with joy amen he said you're coming to mount zion unto the city of the living god of the living god the heavenly jerusalem to an innumerable company of angels look at the stark contrast paul's drawing over here there's darkness there's fire there's voices that you don't understand over here is mount zion amen over here is the city of the living god over here is a heavenly jerusalem an innumerable company of angels amen he said to the general assembly in church of the firstborn amen not not a hybrid something or another the church of the firstborn which are written in heaven and to god the judge of all and to the spirits of just men made perfect hallelujah i want to be scared to come to church do i have to be scared of the word of god i don't have to have condemnation weighing me down and that cloud over me costly where i sit and weep and wonder what am i going to do there's a time for weeping but there's got to be a time where you recognize i have come to a different kind of mountain i'm not coming to the message of the hour to learn how to how to be another cult member i've come to the message of the hour to be free i've come to the message of the hour because this is the innumerable company of angels jesus is the mediator of a new covenant and a blood of sprinkling that speaks better things than that of abel what did abel's blood speak it spoke of it spoke of vengeance cried out for out for for the blood of his brother but now there's a blood that cries out for forgiveness hallelujah so you're not afraid to come around god's people you're not afraid of the spirit of god moving you're not afraid of god being in our midst why because this brooding that you feel is love to you it's love it's not hate it's not it's not rejection it's not throwing you out in hell somewhere stuff are you with me now come to an innumerable company of angels to the general assembly church of the firstborn which are written in heaven to god the judge of all to the spirits of just men made perfect to jesus the mediator of the new covenant to the blood of sprinkling that speaks better things than that of abel see first john 4 18 says there's no fear in love but perfect love casteth out fear because fear hath torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love what is that perfection it's what the holy ghost brings us to brother branham talks about how we grow up into christ it's not an overnight conversion yes we are converted we can point back to a place in a time and all of that but god's growing in us the holy spirit that growing into the image of the son of man in our lives what is it growing growing into a perfect love you see when the holy spirit broods over your life what he did at the beginning he'll do for you i'm so thankful for that you may wake up in the morning there'll be chaos everywhere but as you begin to read and you begin to look you begin to realize brother sam there's there's peace here there's joy here there's order here the world may be out of order my body may feel sick the war everything around me may be spinning out of control but there's peace here why the holy spirit broods over the word to bring peace to bring joy to cast out fear amen let's let him do that amen let's buy our heads together musicians if you would come perhaps we've not allowed him to brood over us like we should we know that we have the holy spirit i believe that you do i'd never try to preach you out of that but perhaps there's something in your life that you just i realize i've been doing some things that aren't right or maybe it's just not spending enough time with him you know you think when you have more time you'll spend more time that's not always true i told myself when i have more time i don't want to get up at 5 30 every morning i'm going to go out and i'm going to walk every morning i'm going to do it but see there has to be a will to do that it has to be something there you say well i don't have the time but we find the time for what we need god help us today we need his spirit we need that brooding we can't live without it without that spirit in the word coming together and producing a life we can't live we can live without everything else i like the potlucks i like the the fellowship i want more of that and my heart longs for that but what we need is the brooding of the holy spirit i pray he would come down right now and just just just settle down over you and just begin to grow you begin to mature you begin to move you into that perfect love where there's not fear anymore not a fear being cast out well what if i'm not one of god's no no there's a love there i know i wouldn't want to cause him any harm i wouldn't want to do anything that would hurt him but i know that i have an advocate if i sin if there's something that's messed up i know god you can heal me i know you can save me i know you can bring me out of it i know you can change me i'm not like that anymore come to god out of fear come to him out of love i love you lord and i want you to move in my life you just talk to him like that for a moment as we pray heavenly father we believe you are here today i don't have to bring you down i know that you're here i don't have to pump you up i know that you're here because you said you would be here oh god help us to rejoice lord because we know you're here lord if there's any fear in the hearts of the people i pray you'd take it out lord sometimes i've realized even as a leader sometimes we produce so much fear in people that that they're afraid to speak up when they need to that's not what it's about jesus didn't come back to thomas and knock him over the head when he doubted but he come to him he said here here look stick your hand in my in my hand in the nail print stick your your hand in my side [Music] why because he was one of yours lord oh god may we be like that lord help us not to come out of fear let's be willing lord if there's a question but he said more blessed are you that have not seen and still believe let us be like that lord let us be like mary it says be it unto me according to thy word i don't have to go out and find a new word i've heard your word i know what your word says let me become that word lord let the holy spirit brood over my life god i pray for this church lord i pray that every service lord it may it shouldn't matter who's here and who's not here that we there should be such a presence of god on this place lord we would know we've been in church oh god may it be so if i'm preaching or somebody else is where the hell i'm brother stewart oh god anoint their ministries with that spirit that goes with the word lord may you anoint our this church not just the preachers but the church lord with your spirit that goes with the words so that we might we might produce something in our lives we we don't want to be we can't do it on our own we don't want to be self-sufficient we don't want to be a mule or we want to be have something shown in our life because you did it i pray you'd grant it lord show produce love bring that to maturity lord that that fruit of love that fruit of peace and longsuffering and patience all these things you promised us we could have bring those things to maturity in your life in our lives is brood over us today granted father we pray if there's any sick among us lord i pray that they would be healed lord those that are sick i pray once again father they would be healed today we believe you're a healer you've done it before you can do it again thank you for all you do in jesus name amen sing it together he's here

the prophet says and you you know as a minister you want to preach you want to preach against sin and then you want to preach grace but you don't want to preach so hard that no one can live it you don't want to preach it too loose that everyone can do whatever they want and i've always looked at it as a minister i was like you know if i preach the law you know brother branham said you can you can dress right act right do everything you want you can you you can live the law to the letter and die and go to hell and so i was like well what should i preach i was like christ amen because if you can as brother ben said this morning if we can get to him he'll line everything up as the prophet come he did it amen and and uh as a minister i really appreciate brother ben how he preaches in his ministry amen we'll just speed it up before we go let's see i saw the light and i'm not sure what key but let's see here amen but don't forget the dinner after the service on the baby shower so just remember that amen but let's just go in the name or in the fear of the lord this morning amen gee we'll go with it and see what happens amen i wondered so aimless life filled with sin i wouldn't let my dear savior in and then jesus came like a stranger in the night praise the lord i saw the light and i saw the light i saw the light no more in darkness no more in now i'm so happy no sorrow inside praise the lord i saw the light just like the blind man i wondered alone worries and fears i claim for my own and then like the blind man that god gave back his praise the lord i saw the light and i saw the light i saw the light no more in darkness no more at night now i'm so happy no sorrow inside praise the lord i saw the light i was a fool to wander and stray straight is the gate and narrow the way now i have traded the wrong for the right praise the lord amen you're free to go in the name of the lord i saw the light i saw the light no more in darkness no more in night and now i'm so happy no sorrow inside
