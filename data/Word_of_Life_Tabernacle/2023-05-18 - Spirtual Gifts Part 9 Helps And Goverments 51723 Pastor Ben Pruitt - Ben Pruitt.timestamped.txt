[48:37] let's love the presence of the Lord
[48:39] just helps you to put aside all the all
[48:41] the worry of the weak and all the things
[48:43] that have gone on and just just basking
[48:46] his presence so wonderful that he meets
[48:48] us on a Wednesday night First
[48:51] Corinthians chapter 12 and verses 28-31
[48:55] First Corinthians 12 28-31 I'm going to
[48:58] skip ahead a little bit and then we'll
[49:01] go back to tongues and interpretation
[49:03] next week the Lord willing tonight I
[49:06] want to talk about helps and governments
[49:08] helps and governments
[49:11] gifts that are in the body maybe not the
[49:14] same type of gift as tongues and
[49:16] prophecy and those things but it's still
[49:18] a gift that's in the body we'll talk
[49:20] about it tonight First Corinthians 12 28
[49:23] God has set some in the church
[49:26] first apostles and when Paul says first
[49:29] secondarily third least talking about
[49:31] the order of importance to the body now
[49:35] that's the order of the importance of
[49:37] the gift not the order of importance of
[49:40] the person
[49:41] and we need to make sure that we don't
[49:43] judge ourselves or value ourselves by
[49:47] our gifts
[49:48] because a person could have a gift from
[49:50] God and go to hell with it
[49:52] and have a great gift but we're not
[49:55] valued by our gift we don't want to do
[49:57] that because God could use you one time
[49:59] and never use you again
[50:01] and then you'd always try to be used in
[50:03] that way and and your time is over but
[50:05] but I say God ever use me today let me
[50:08] be a benefit to the body of Christ today
[50:10] in any way that I can so so he says
[50:13] first Apostle secondarily prophets
[50:15] thirdly teachers after that Miracles
[50:18] then Gifts of healings helps
[50:21] governments diversities of tongues are
[50:25] all Apostles are all prophets are all
[50:27] teachers are all workers of Miracles
[50:29] have all the gifts of healing to all
[50:31] speak with tongues to all interpret it
[50:34] he said but covet earnestly the best
[50:36] gifts
[50:37] and yet show I unto you a more excellent
[50:40] way pray the Lord would add his Blessing
[50:42] to the word you may be seated
[50:47] good to have brother Jonah Malachi with
[50:49] us tonight God bless you guys thank you
[50:51] for coming out Joel's
[50:54] pro-growth he told me in the church
[50:57] so if you do it one way or another so
[50:59] that's uh that's how you do it right
[51:01] there
[51:02] and get all them kids grown up and lined
[51:06] up while you're on the front and we'll
[51:07] have a good church full isn't it good to
[51:09] be in the house of the Lord tonight
[51:11] amen I trust you just I just feel
[51:13] relaxed tonight and I believe the Lord
[51:15] is going to help us not a wonderful
[51:17] testimony last Wednesday but Al and I I
[51:21] last week I don't ever do this I'm
[51:23] always ready on Tuesday but last week on
[51:26] Wednesday I changed the middle part of
[51:28] that sermon and added in all that about
[51:30] headaches and I thought what in the
[51:31] world am I doing I questioned myself
[51:33] about that but it was just the Lord and
[51:35] thank the Lord for that and God can
[51:38] speak to the word is a discerner of the
[51:40] thoughts intents of the heart amen we
[51:42] believe that tonight so I trust this
[51:44] will be a blessing to you tonight in
[51:46] some way Paul is list these two gifts
[51:49] helps and governments and they're not
[51:51] mentioned in verses 8 through 10 which
[51:53] is where we've been reading from in the
[51:55] nine spiritual gifts but they are
[51:57] mentioned before tongues and
[51:58] interpretation in uh in in this part and
[52:03] I think most people in a local church
[52:05] identify with one of these gifts helps
[52:08] and governments I think this is probably
[52:11] something that we could all have in on
[52:14] in some level or in some way uh working
[52:16] in our lives if you're a Christian now
[52:19] Paul's idea of the church is very
[52:22] different from a modern Church a modern
[52:24] church is pretty much I don't want to be
[52:27] too critical tonight but it's become a
[52:29] stage show where you go and and
[52:32] everybody watches people or uh has
[52:35] become a production I don't think that
[52:38] Christianity ought to be a production
[52:40] it's a it's a body
[52:42] it's not a business it's a body I told
[52:45] you the story before about a a man that
[52:48] was taking some ministerial students
[52:49] through a church and that janitor was
[52:51] there cleaning up and and he asked him
[52:53] he said did you have a good service this
[52:55] morning he said yeah he said we
[52:56] processed a thousand units
[52:59] and it kind of took him back he said
[53:01] what in the world is he talking about
[53:02] well they had a thousand people come to
[53:04] the doors and to the church staff they'd
[53:07] become units that become their their
[53:09] trade was in people and that's how they
[53:12] made their money and made their living
[53:13] but that's not what we do this is uh
[53:15] this is a a service this is a this is a
[53:20] body we are a body
[53:23] and you know it's different than a
[53:26] business you know cutting a cancer out
[53:28] of a person's body is much more delicate
[53:31] than uh cutting dead weight in a
[53:34] business
[53:34] firing somebody because whenever you
[53:38] remove a part of the body that part dies
[53:42] you realize that you cannot live apart
[53:45] from the body
[53:47] right so whenever you you remove apart
[53:50] from the body then that part dies and
[53:52] and you realize the body then is
[53:54] affected in some way even cancer if you
[53:58] cut out a cancer it leaves a scar tissue
[54:00] surgery even the best surgery and the
[54:04] most well done it done with care it
[54:06] leaves Scar Tissue it leaves a a trauma
[54:09] in the body and so you always you know
[54:11] if you went to the doctor Brother David
[54:13] and you say well there's something wrong
[54:16] with my head he said well let's just cut
[54:17] it off
[54:18] you say well I believe I'll find a
[54:20] different doctor
[54:22] a doctor I got I got my hands hurt I
[54:24] want you to patch it up well we'll just
[54:25] cut it off that's not how you deal with
[54:28] a body because the body part is
[54:30] Irreplaceable on some level it's it's
[54:33] it's Irreplaceable and you are
[54:36] irreplaceable tonight in the body of
[54:37] Christ
[54:38] but you don't get to choose which part
[54:40] of that body you are
[54:43] do you ever think about that your hand
[54:44] didn't wake up one day and realize hey
[54:46] and think and say well I'm a hand I'm
[54:48] going to be a hand
[54:50] go be a hand and you can't do that your
[54:53] foot didn't decide one day well I'm a
[54:55] foot I'm gonna go be a foot I'll be a I
[54:57] think I'll be a good foot no it was made
[54:59] to be afoot it was created with the
[55:02] proper ability to do that and that's the
[55:05] way the body is
[55:06] so if we go back to verse 12 in First
[55:10] Corinthians 12 12 Paul talks about the
[55:12] body he said for as the body is one
[55:14] someone say one the body is one it's not
[55:18] many bodies it's one body yeah he said
[55:20] and has many members and all the members
[55:23] of that one body being many are one body
[55:25] so also is Christ
[55:28] for by one Spirit are we all baptized
[55:31] into one body whether we be Jews or
[55:34] Gentiles whether we'd be Bond or free we
[55:36] have been all made to drink into one
[55:39] Spirit aren't you glad of that tonight
[55:41] so so he's he's emphasizing this we're
[55:44] one but we're different
[55:45] right so First Corinthians 12 14 for the
[55:47] body is not one member but many he talks
[55:50] about the different parts there and then
[55:52] in verse 18 He said but now has God set
[55:54] to members every one of them in the body
[55:57] as it hath pleased him
[56:00] as it has pleased him
[56:03] so he made the eye and I he made the ear
[56:06] and ear and he made it with certain
[56:08] characteristics to be able to do the job
[56:11] that it was made for you would think it
[56:14] was kind of odd if your thumb decided to
[56:16] be the eye and it was and God didn't
[56:18] make a thumb with the ability to see
[56:21] right and your eye can't decide to be
[56:23] your thumb they cannot take each other's
[56:25] place
[56:26] they belong where they're at
[56:29] hey man we need to we need to recognize
[56:31] that God gifted us and many times you
[56:33] look at your natural many times we
[56:35] undervalue we're looking for great
[56:37] spiritual things and we undervalue the
[56:39] way God made us he made us to be a help
[56:42] to one another he made us to be an
[56:45] encouragement to one another he made us
[56:47] to and we're looking for some great
[56:48] spiritual thing to do and maybe the
[56:51] thing we ought to be doing is right
[56:52] beside us
[56:54] or stop doing
[56:57] right because sometimes that helps the
[56:59] body
[57:00] see him he made the ionai made the ear
[57:02] and ear and Paul says if they were all
[57:04] one member where were the body they were
[57:06] all the same there's no body
[57:08] he said but now are they many members
[57:10] but one body and then I cannot say it to
[57:13] the hand I have no need of thee nor
[57:15] again to the head to the feet I have no
[57:17] need of you name much more those members
[57:20] of the body which seem to be more feeble
[57:22] or more are necessary I think of our
[57:25] elderly people and and some of the folks
[57:27] that are not able to be here maybe on a
[57:30] Wednesday night but they they're here
[57:31] with us in spirit or maybe they're
[57:33] trying attempting to watch on the on the
[57:35] internet and and for them those members
[57:38] of the body which you maybe you don't
[57:40] think about them all the time but
[57:41] they're necessary
[57:43] they're necessary and those members of
[57:46] the body which we think to be less
[57:47] honorable upon these we bestow more
[57:50] abundant honor and our uncommonly parts
[57:52] have more abundant comeliness
[57:55] he said you said you say brother Brandon
[57:58] I'm the least in the church I'm just a
[57:59] little bitty fellow how many ever felt
[58:01] like that
[58:02] he said but remember when he ascended on
[58:04] high you raised with him you're in the
[58:07] body
[58:08] he said and you're with Christ right now
[58:10] how many believe that tonight seated in
[58:13] Heavenly places if you're the skin on
[58:16] the bottom of the feet every devil is
[58:19] underneath you oh if we could ever get a
[58:21] realization of that tonight if you're
[58:23] the skin on the bottom of the feet you
[58:25] may not do anything in the church you
[58:26] may not have any role visible role in
[58:29] the church but you're part of the body
[58:30] so you're a conqueror you're an
[58:32] overcomer
[58:33] with every other part of the body
[58:37] so your gift is just your place in the
[58:39] body
[58:40] if we could say it that way
[58:42] if you have an eye gift he's not going
[58:43] to place you on the bottom of the foot
[58:46] be hard for you to see
[58:48] and so we want to keep that in mind as
[58:50] we go along now helps
[58:52] the word helps the Greek word antolinsis
[58:55] refers to assisting people in need
[58:59] but it also gives the idea of calling
[59:01] upon God in a time of turmoil so that he
[59:04] can act in the situation with his full
[59:07] power and force
[59:09] so it's the idea of someone who assists
[59:11] jumps in and helps with whatever needs
[59:14] done
[59:15] especially someone who assists in prayer
[59:18] and brother Branham says it's about that
[59:20] he said remember your prayers for me he
[59:23] said that means you're my colleague
[59:25] you're my buddy you're my helper you may
[59:28] never traveled with him or done anything
[59:29] like that but but he said when you
[59:31] prayed for me you're my colleague you're
[59:33] my buddy you're my helper and together
[59:35] we are helpers in the Lord
[59:38] and we find in the scripture a great
[59:40] example of that as Aaron and hers they
[59:42] were as they were standing there with
[59:44] with Moses and Moses realized during the
[59:47] battle as they were fighting that as
[59:49] long as he kept his hands raised that
[59:52] the battle would go for Israel and when
[59:54] he put his hands down then the battle
[59:56] would go the other way and it shows us
[59:58] The Importance of Being in our position
[1:00:01] but Moses it's the visible part of that
[1:00:04] and he's the one with the office that
[1:00:06] has to keep his hands raised so he could
[1:00:08] say it like this in a local church the
[1:00:10] pastor has to be in his position
[1:00:12] right keep his hands raised and got to
[1:00:15] preach and and there's things that the
[1:00:17] pastor has to do he's got to be a part
[1:00:19] of the body and it's a very public
[1:00:21] position but for Aaron and her had to be
[1:00:23] there as well and there's nothing in the
[1:00:25] scripture that said Moses asked them but
[1:00:28] they must have noticed that the battle
[1:00:29] was going better when he had his hands
[1:00:31] up so what do they do they go get a rock
[1:00:33] and put it under it let him sit on it
[1:00:36] and then one got on one side and one God
[1:00:38] on the other and held his hands up
[1:00:40] says Moses hands were heavy and our
[1:00:42] hands get heavy sometimes sometimes the
[1:00:45] pastor's hands get heavy sometimes the
[1:00:47] Deacon's hands get heavy sometimes the
[1:00:49] singers the musicians their hands get
[1:00:51] heavy and it's our job to get up beside
[1:00:53] them and lift them up
[1:00:55] one on one side and the other on the
[1:00:58] other side his hands were steady until
[1:01:00] the going down of the Sun
[1:01:02] they just stepped in and did what needed
[1:01:04] to be done that helps
[1:01:07] right they say for every one soldier
[1:01:09] that saw combat in Iraq or Afghanistan
[1:01:12] there were eight soldiers behind the
[1:01:14] scenes never saw battle
[1:01:17] but holding their hands up
[1:01:20] without them many many more men would
[1:01:22] have been lost
[1:01:24] an Army's strength is determined not
[1:01:27] just by how many soldiers it can put in
[1:01:30] combat but how many people it has to put
[1:01:33] behind them
[1:01:34] to supply them to help them to supply
[1:01:38] Logistics to supply information and the
[1:01:41] army of God is the same way listen we're
[1:01:43] in an army
[1:01:44] we're fighting the battle
[1:01:46] and I'll be honest with you I want the
[1:01:48] general to be the very best city can be
[1:01:50] I want the soldiers to be the very best
[1:01:52] they can be I don't you know I've always
[1:01:54] thought especially in an ancient battle
[1:01:55] when you fought in lines I wouldn't want
[1:01:58] to be one of the first ones
[1:02:00] well Danny I I don't want to be I have
[1:02:02] no desire to be on the front lines in a
[1:02:04] Civil War battle or a revolutionary war
[1:02:06] Battle them guys are nuts
[1:02:09] volunteer for the front lines right you
[1:02:11] want to be one of the guys in the back
[1:02:13] because the worms the front lines gonna
[1:02:14] get shot up but somebody's got to do it
[1:02:16] there's got to be somebody with that
[1:02:18] kind of personality that kind of gift
[1:02:20] that kind of ability but it also takes
[1:02:22] somebody behind them to push them
[1:02:24] forward
[1:02:27] and they say I'm kind of getting ahead
[1:02:29] of myself but they say that the uh the
[1:02:31] Greeks the soldiers for the Greeks they
[1:02:33] would uh go into Phalanx I think is what
[1:02:35] it's called to maybe mispronouncing that
[1:02:37] but they would actually and I've talked
[1:02:40] about it before they would actually held
[1:02:41] a a shield in their left hand and a
[1:02:44] spear in their right hand
[1:02:46] and the The Shield would cover half of
[1:02:49] their body and half of their neighbors
[1:02:51] and they would actually put them they
[1:02:53] would put like a brother beside a
[1:02:55] brother people from the same town they'd
[1:02:56] put them together because they wanted
[1:02:58] them to fight for each other
[1:03:00] and so there was a saying among the the
[1:03:03] mothers when they would send the Spartan
[1:03:05] soldiers out to war and they would they
[1:03:08] would say they would say come back
[1:03:10] either with your Shield or on it
[1:03:13] with your Shield or on it because if you
[1:03:16] come back alive without your Shield it
[1:03:18] means somebody else died yeah
[1:03:19] because you weren't in your position
[1:03:21] right
[1:03:22] right oh God if we could just understand
[1:03:24] that today let me be in my position come
[1:03:28] back with my shield or on it I might die
[1:03:30] in battle but I died fighting for the my
[1:03:32] brother fighting for the Lord I might
[1:03:34] get hurt but I've died doing what I was
[1:03:35] supposed to be doing
[1:03:38] yeah
[1:03:40] and we're in a battle
[1:03:43] we want everybody in a battle to know
[1:03:45] what they're doing and be the very best
[1:03:48] at what they do
[1:03:50] Brother Bear I'm talking about brother
[1:03:51] Neville he said he certainly goes under
[1:03:52] a lot of Labor and strains and things
[1:03:54] you people here hold him up like Joshua
[1:03:56] and Caleb held up the hands of Moses as
[1:03:58] he's bringing the word he said brother
[1:04:00] Bennett do we not hold you up enough I
[1:04:01] say that you do you I'm not talking
[1:04:03] about myself but just in general I'll
[1:04:05] say this standing here behind the pulpit
[1:04:08] is a is a fearful thing
[1:04:10] and what we need to hold one another up
[1:04:13] many times it's just responding to the
[1:04:15] word
[1:04:16] I appreciate some of you I know when
[1:04:18] you're missing because because that
[1:04:20] response isn't there I'm so glad you
[1:04:22] respond to the word saying amen is
[1:04:25] helping
[1:04:27] and some people have a gift for that
[1:04:31] some of y'all have a gift for it don't
[1:04:32] use it very much
[1:04:36] the most underutilized gift in the
[1:04:38] churches so the gift of saying amen
[1:04:40] but it is a gift
[1:04:42] to respond to the word God gives you the
[1:04:44] ability to do that and you know you can
[1:04:46] sit there and never respond and it would
[1:04:48] help you
[1:04:49] but it doesn't help me none
[1:04:52] right doesn't help the whatever preacher
[1:04:54] is up here brother Andrew brother Joel
[1:04:56] or brother or brother Alan brother
[1:04:57] Stewart or any of the brothers it
[1:04:59] doesn't help them at all to be standing
[1:05:01] behind the pulpit and and you sit there
[1:05:03] with your arms folded yet you would
[1:05:05] receive but I'll say this some of you
[1:05:07] even by your faces you let me know
[1:05:08] you're on the right Trail and and let me
[1:05:11] know that and I appreciate that but but
[1:05:14] saying amen every once in a while I
[1:05:15] wouldn't hurt
[1:05:18] and brother Brandon talked about that he
[1:05:20] said I was preaching here not long ago
[1:05:21] and this little woman just screaming and
[1:05:23] shouting on top of her voice
[1:05:24] he said there was a man that's a son
[1:05:25] he's going to teach her in a Baptist
[1:05:27] Church in Jeffersonville he said Billy I
[1:05:29] was enjoying your service till that
[1:05:30] woman got to screaming and crying he
[1:05:31] said how in the world can you preach
[1:05:33] when people are hollering like that I
[1:05:35] said I can't preach unless they do
[1:05:36] holler like that he said I don't know
[1:05:38] where I'm standing don't know how
[1:05:40] they're receiving it
[1:05:42] right so at least not right so I know
[1:05:44] how you're receiving it
[1:05:47] or maybe smile
[1:05:50] he said I used to have an old dog I used
[1:05:52] to hunt with
[1:05:54] he said we call him Fritz he would take
[1:05:56] anything tree anything in the world but
[1:05:59] a skunk he just wouldn't go into him
[1:06:01] he'd dream in a brush pile and he'd keep
[1:06:03] going around and around the brush pile
[1:06:05] barking
[1:06:06] he said the only thing I had to do to
[1:06:07] get him to go in and get that skunk
[1:06:09] would just raise up the brush pile and
[1:06:11] Pat him and say sick him boy sick him
[1:06:14] boy he'd go in and get the skunk
[1:06:16] you know sometimes we just need some
[1:06:17] sympathy amens
[1:06:22] and some of y'all are sympathy a manners
[1:06:23] I won't call your names but when I get
[1:06:25] in trouble up here you you start backing
[1:06:27] me I appreciate that
[1:06:29] a sicken boy
[1:06:31] go get him amen he said brother he said
[1:06:34] every time I hear amen it's sicken boy
[1:06:37] and the biggest skunk I know of is the
[1:06:39] devil let's get him up a bush right now
[1:06:41] go get it that's right seek Him boy
[1:06:45] good you realize if we come with such
[1:06:47] faith I was I'm marveled at how watching
[1:06:49] just a clip of the video raised
[1:06:51] everyone's Faith last Sunday night or
[1:06:53] last Wednesday night rather I just
[1:06:54] marveled at that I thought what if we
[1:06:56] come in with that kind of a faith into
[1:06:58] every service believing that God could
[1:07:00] do anything believing that the power of
[1:07:02] God was still alive today I believe we
[1:07:05] can do that because he is the same
[1:07:08] yesterday today and forever he is still
[1:07:10] the same God he's the same Jehovah Jireh
[1:07:15] and you can take a preacher it's not
[1:07:17] much of a preacher and I know this by
[1:07:19] experience you can take a preacher that
[1:07:21] can't hardly preach his way out of a wet
[1:07:23] paper bag but you take a a church that's
[1:07:25] on fire and filled up with faith and
[1:07:28] watch that preacher start to preach
[1:07:33] makes a difference
[1:07:35] sometimes just helping someone we're
[1:07:37] fixing to have meetings
[1:07:39] you realize sometimes some of you people
[1:07:41] I know in a church this size if you have
[1:07:45] meetings and there's twice as many
[1:07:46] people here as what goes to church here
[1:07:48] and then you start thinking well all I'm
[1:07:50] going to do is work and then I know
[1:07:52] that's true for some of us especially
[1:07:53] you ladies you're you're working and we
[1:07:56] try to take as much off of you as we can
[1:07:58] by buying food and things but but you're
[1:08:00] working you're helping your cleaning and
[1:08:02] then those that assist the deacons the
[1:08:03] deacons themselves and and and those of
[1:08:06] us who get uh motels for people and and
[1:08:09] houses for people and our meetings are
[1:08:11] coming up there's going to be a lot to
[1:08:12] do and we're going to talk about that
[1:08:14] that's where we really need a gift of
[1:08:15] helps
[1:08:16] it's in times like that but you know
[1:08:18] we're not just doing that for us
[1:08:20] although it is for us primarily but
[1:08:22] we're doing it it's a love gift to our
[1:08:24] our community and and to the people
[1:08:26] around us maybe not everybody can have a
[1:08:28] meeting like that we have the facilities
[1:08:30] to do that then we should do that we
[1:08:33] should do what we're able because we're
[1:08:34] only here for so long
[1:08:36] we only have so many times we're able to
[1:08:38] gather together like that let's give it
[1:08:40] all that we've got and try to be here
[1:08:42] and do what we can but I got thinking
[1:08:44] about this some of you helped in the
[1:08:45] prayer line last year and and maybe
[1:08:47] we'll have one this year if the Lord
[1:08:49] allows us to but helping the prayer line
[1:08:51] sometimes could cause you to be healed
[1:08:55] do you know that but Perry green told
[1:08:57] the story of how he was helping in a
[1:08:59] prayer line as a 16 year old boy and
[1:09:02] Billy Paul become friends with Billy
[1:09:04] Paul and Billy Paul lady helping the
[1:09:05] prayer line and so he because of that he
[1:09:07] got a prayer card and brother Branham
[1:09:09] hey it wasn't really that sick but he
[1:09:11] had a bowel trouble and brother Branham
[1:09:12] before he even got up to the front he
[1:09:15] called him out and and he told him what
[1:09:17] was wrong with him and everything and he
[1:09:18] was healed from that time on
[1:09:20] and told him he was called to preach so
[1:09:22] he benefited just by being involved
[1:09:25] and there's another case brother Brown
[1:09:27] says that he was talking to someone who
[1:09:30] didn't speak English which like we
[1:09:31] talked about last Wednesday night if you
[1:09:33] want to prove the prophet wasn't reading
[1:09:34] people's prayer cards
[1:09:36] here's a person who didn't have a prayer
[1:09:38] card and didn't speak English
[1:09:41] so they weren't telling him what was
[1:09:42] wrong with them
[1:09:43] they weren't writing it down yeah and
[1:09:46] brother Brown discerned that and had
[1:09:47] someone help him and do that and then he
[1:09:50] says this he said that man that was
[1:09:51] trying to help that other man there
[1:09:53] sir you did God a favor
[1:09:57] you helped I want to be somebody who
[1:10:00] helps
[1:10:01] he said you helped you was trying he
[1:10:04] said yes trying to tell you he said you
[1:10:06] don't have to come stand right there he
[1:10:08] said you speak English he said you have
[1:10:10] a prayer card he said you don't have it
[1:10:12] all right if you'll believe with all
[1:10:13] your heart that hernia will leave you
[1:10:15] you can go home and be well
[1:10:17] he was a helper yeah
[1:10:20] just wanted to be a help
[1:10:23] oh my we're brothers fighting in a
[1:10:25] battle I'll say uh when we go into
[1:10:28] battle when we go into a meeting when we
[1:10:30] have church just on a regular basis when
[1:10:32] there's sickness in the church when
[1:10:33] there's trouble when things are stirred
[1:10:35] up and I just read this week or brother
[1:10:36] random said if you if you run away from
[1:10:38] the church and say well I'll just stay
[1:10:40] away for a while when there's trouble he
[1:10:41] said I question your experience
[1:10:44] but but then now we live in a time when
[1:10:47] there's always going to be something
[1:10:48] going on but we're fighting a battle
[1:10:49] it's a spiritual warfare I say come back
[1:10:52] with your Shield or come back on it give
[1:10:55] it all you've got
[1:10:59] that helps
[1:11:01] there's also governments
[1:11:04] governments is the word first the Greek
[1:11:06] word is the word for steering or
[1:11:07] piloting governing it's anybody in
[1:11:11] charge of anything in the church and
[1:11:12] there's more of those than what you
[1:11:13] think
[1:11:14] somebody's in charge of making sure the
[1:11:16] floor gets swept
[1:11:18] all right somebody's in charge of making
[1:11:20] sure the diapers and get out of the
[1:11:22] nursery
[1:11:23] somebody's in charge of playing the
[1:11:25] piano
[1:11:27] somebody's in charge of playing the
[1:11:30] instrument somebody is in charge of
[1:11:32] Sunday School
[1:11:34] right and a lot of times that gets
[1:11:36] unheralded it's not just the pastor it's
[1:11:38] a pastor trying to do everything believe
[1:11:40] me I've done it and some of the folks
[1:11:42] from Brownsville will remember and I'm
[1:11:44] sure they'll get a chuckle out of this
[1:11:45] but I there's been times I led singing
[1:11:48] and preached
[1:11:49] and there's times brother JT did
[1:11:51] everything but what I was doing and and
[1:11:53] we know what that's like we've been
[1:11:55] there and you you didn't have I didn't
[1:11:58] have any Deacons and and we we had one
[1:12:01] or two trustees and three trustees and
[1:12:03] that's what we had and and we just tried
[1:12:05] to work through that I think God we've
[1:12:07] got Administration we got people to help
[1:12:10] so you do with what you have to do with
[1:12:12] when you don't have it but I think God
[1:12:15] that we do have it now audio and video
[1:12:18] worker she said well that's not a
[1:12:20] Ministry what about to the people that
[1:12:21] aren't here tonight
[1:12:23] it's Administration
[1:12:26] and it don't always work sometimes our
[1:12:28] it's another internet doesn't work but
[1:12:30] we try to do our best to back it up and
[1:12:32] try to make sure that we get at least a
[1:12:34] copy because it could be something that
[1:12:35] would help somebody not because I'm
[1:12:36] important or I've got something to say
[1:12:38] but we believe God as a church God
[1:12:40] honors us when we come together and
[1:12:42] speaks to us no matter who's in the
[1:12:45] pulpit
[1:12:46] and I don't have time tonight to go
[1:12:48] through every duty of every office
[1:12:49] that's not my purpose but but I want to
[1:12:51] address this question tonight because I
[1:12:53] think it'll help you because we're a
[1:12:55] growing church and and and and things
[1:12:57] that are changing and have changed over
[1:13:00] time and things necessarily change just
[1:13:02] because people get older now right
[1:13:03] brother Danny you just over time you
[1:13:05] just can't do what you used to do and
[1:13:07] some of y'all know that and and so you
[1:13:09] change you get more wisdom and and so we
[1:13:12] we value our elders in that way but but
[1:13:15] how do I know what office I should be in
[1:13:19] and that's really important for those of
[1:13:21] you that are younger because it may be
[1:13:22] years but you need to think about these
[1:13:24] things ahead of time and and you need to
[1:13:27] prepare yourself keep your life right so
[1:13:29] that you could do something in the
[1:13:31] church
[1:13:32] if the time came
[1:13:34] because it's not just all about well I'm
[1:13:36] predestinated that's I believe you are I
[1:13:38] believe you'll make it you're going to
[1:13:39] make it
[1:13:40] but you want to be a benefit to somebody
[1:13:43] I mean and most of you are because we're
[1:13:46] still small enough that it takes most of
[1:13:47] us just to make it
[1:13:50] right especially on a Wednesday night
[1:13:52] but Paul said covet the best gifts and I
[1:13:56] think when he says the best gift he's
[1:13:57] saying that the most beneficial to the
[1:13:59] body
[1:14:00] the gifts most beneficial to the body
[1:14:02] yet again you can't choose where you go
[1:14:04] in the body
[1:14:05] and I would say the first thing that you
[1:14:07] need to ask yourself if you want to know
[1:14:10] what office you should be in is this
[1:14:11] okay tonight
[1:14:13] what needs to be done
[1:14:15] there's first thing I mean we only need
[1:14:18] so many preachers
[1:14:19] in a service
[1:14:21] right we only need so many song leaders
[1:14:24] only need so many but are people not
[1:14:26] getting seated maybe the church needs an
[1:14:27] usher does the carpet need clean maybe
[1:14:30] the church needs a janitor
[1:14:32] other bunch of kids running around
[1:14:33] there's probably plenty of opportunities
[1:14:35] there
[1:14:37] for people to help
[1:14:39] brother Brandon makes a statement he
[1:14:41] said it used to be when I was here he
[1:14:42] said he said I was the pastor I was the
[1:14:44] song leader boy I know what he feels
[1:14:46] like every preacher ought to go through
[1:14:48] this at some point in their life by the
[1:14:49] way
[1:14:51] he said I was the pastor I was the song
[1:14:52] leader I took up the offerings I paid
[1:14:54] the debts I Was the janitor I was the
[1:14:56] carpenter I never was that one although
[1:14:59] I did remodel our uh I forgot about that
[1:15:02] I did remodel our foyer one time it was
[1:15:04] very small and the work was done very
[1:15:05] badly but I got I did it myself
[1:15:10] so I'm warning you
[1:15:14] I think it's going done I I can't lay
[1:15:16] carpet
[1:15:18] and he said I Was the janitor I was the
[1:15:20] carpenter I just cleaned the ashes out
[1:15:22] of the stove and done whatever come
[1:15:23] along to be done he said then worked at
[1:15:25] the Public Service Company on the side
[1:15:27] 17 years of that we think of you know
[1:15:30] and this I'll encourage those of you who
[1:15:32] are waiting on your ministry or waiting
[1:15:33] on you know you think well all this time
[1:15:35] I've struggled and and I'm not getting
[1:15:37] out I'm not getting the preacher I'm not
[1:15:39] getting the recognition even in the
[1:15:40] local church that I should get but
[1:15:42] brother Branham labor for 17 years with
[1:15:44] that gift
[1:15:46] in a church where he had to do
[1:15:48] everything
[1:15:51] and he said I don't encourage us our
[1:15:54] breakthrough is coming
[1:15:57] be patient look he said when I pastored
[1:16:00] here I had to be a pastor Deacon trustee
[1:16:02] everything else at once see he said but
[1:16:04] I had to do it he said now you don't
[1:16:06] have to do it that way because you got
[1:16:08] men to carry this out I think that's
[1:16:09] where we're at
[1:16:11] now you know so what needs to be done I
[1:16:14] think the second thing you want to ask
[1:16:15] yourself is what can you do
[1:16:17] and then be honest with yourself about
[1:16:19] that
[1:16:20] because we're not real good judges about
[1:16:22] what we can do well
[1:16:24] ourselves but you know how you find out
[1:16:26] and ask somebody
[1:16:28] right so as the church grows it becomes
[1:16:31] more even more than what can I do what
[1:16:33] can I do well
[1:16:35] because there's people who can do things
[1:16:37] but what can I do well so the Bible says
[1:16:40] we have gifts differing according to the
[1:16:42] grace that is given to us our gifts
[1:16:45] differ even even preachers differ among
[1:16:48] themselves
[1:16:49] some pastors have more of a gift than
[1:16:52] other pastors
[1:16:53] and it don't make the other Pastor not
[1:16:55] called of God
[1:16:56] right some some preachers have more of a
[1:16:58] gift than other preachers some preachers
[1:17:00] are better evangelists than others
[1:17:03] I can go out and preach a meeting but
[1:17:04] I'm not the Evangelist Andrew Glover is
[1:17:07] I can I can slip into that role but I
[1:17:09] can't do what he does or brother Daryl
[1:17:11] Ward or somebody like that but the jewel
[1:17:13] Forney as he used to go and do that
[1:17:15] those men were real are real evangelists
[1:17:18] and I can't feel those shoes so our
[1:17:20] gifts differ but even among evangelist
[1:17:22] gifts differ
[1:17:23] and so he said according to the grace
[1:17:26] that is given to us
[1:17:28] whether prophecy let us prophesy
[1:17:30] according to the proportion of Faith so
[1:17:32] there's a certain amount of faith that
[1:17:33] you have to be able to prophesy and and
[1:17:36] you have to learn that you have to learn
[1:17:38] what your limits are learn what your
[1:17:40] boundaries are
[1:17:42] and you know
[1:17:44] not all the puzzle pieces are the same
[1:17:48] you may be an edge piece but you might
[1:17:49] be a middle piece
[1:17:51] but if you're an edge piece don't try to
[1:17:53] force yourself into the middle of the
[1:17:54] picture
[1:17:55] but if you're a middle piece don't try
[1:17:57] to force yourself to the edge
[1:17:59] right you belong in the middle
[1:18:01] and but God needs all of them there is
[1:18:03] nothing more disappointing than buying a
[1:18:05] puzzle and getting it done and there's a
[1:18:07] piece missing
[1:18:09] huh and it's the same way with the
[1:18:11] church we need each other don't we I
[1:18:15] need your Shield you need my shield
[1:18:18] Hallelujah
[1:18:20] so it becomes oh what can I do well now
[1:18:22] the brand talked about this he said to
[1:18:24] little brother here he said the song
[1:18:26] leader brother Cobble many others here
[1:18:28] God has given you Talent maybe you say
[1:18:30] well brother Brown he hasn't given me
[1:18:31] nothing I know sometimes we feel that
[1:18:33] way he said you don't know maybe
[1:18:36] see you may just go try something maybe
[1:18:39] you've never went out and testified to
[1:18:41] somebody try that
[1:18:44] yes he said everybody can't do that
[1:18:46] maybe you can't he said something else
[1:18:48] that you could do there's something you
[1:18:50] can do that you can put it to God you
[1:18:53] know there's some people maybe could
[1:18:54] never have the courage to go witness
[1:18:57] like maybe somebody else could but they
[1:18:59] can make money
[1:19:00] and and they pay their tithes and their
[1:19:02] offerings maybe God allowed you to have
[1:19:04] that gift for a reason
[1:19:06] all right but if you can testify maybe
[1:19:08] you should try that
[1:19:10] there's something you can do you can put
[1:19:12] it to God he said well now the thing you
[1:19:13] have to do is do what the brother's
[1:19:15] singing his song yield
[1:19:17] he said I love this he said the man who
[1:19:19] could whistle and impersonate all the
[1:19:22] birds that I ever heard he said well
[1:19:24] then that man yielded himself to it
[1:19:27] now there's a strange gift
[1:19:30] but brother Branham attributed that to
[1:19:32] God
[1:19:33] now I don't necessarily think that gift
[1:19:35] would need to be up in front all the
[1:19:36] time
[1:19:38] because there's only so much edification
[1:19:40] you can get from somebody being able to
[1:19:41] whistle like a bird
[1:19:44] right but it was given to the man for a
[1:19:47] reason
[1:19:48] at some point there's somebody that he
[1:19:50] could that was edified by that
[1:19:52] and so the man just yielded himself to
[1:19:54] it give it to it and so he said the man
[1:19:56] who could sing he yielded himself he
[1:19:58] give in to it he said now for these
[1:20:01] things here of the gospel and the
[1:20:02] manifestation of Visions I just yield
[1:20:04] myself and give in to it and that's what
[1:20:06] does it see it's not me it's him and
[1:20:09] it's something that you can't help
[1:20:11] the man can't help he was born to
[1:20:13] whistle like birds
[1:20:16] right
[1:20:17] and that's not hard to see and you get
[1:20:20] we get way up in the clouds about it oh
[1:20:22] I don't understand what my gift is
[1:20:24] brother Ben and I preach all this about
[1:20:26] gifts and and there's a purpose behind
[1:20:28] it and there's different purposes behind
[1:20:30] it but but when it comes to this part
[1:20:33] it's like we want to know what gift do I
[1:20:35] have and how should I be operating well
[1:20:37] it becomes evident in our life just be
[1:20:39] patient wait on your ministry
[1:20:42] and it becomes evident what you should
[1:20:44] be doing or what you shouldn't be doing
[1:20:47] so you if you're born to whistle like
[1:20:50] birds bless your heart there's got to be
[1:20:53] a place for you
[1:20:55] but I'll say this I don't have to find a
[1:20:56] place for you the gift will make room
[1:20:58] for itself
[1:21:00] somebody will appreciate that
[1:21:06] I I was edified you know some of you all
[1:21:08] like to talk and that can be you know a
[1:21:10] double-edged sword
[1:21:12] but Joel likes to talk brother Joe likes
[1:21:14] to talk but Logan likes to talk I mean
[1:21:16] to call you guys out but you know but
[1:21:18] Logan was talking to me the other night
[1:21:19] and and uh and and I got a sermon out of
[1:21:22] that
[1:21:23] I actually preached a sermon out of
[1:21:25] something he told me and y'all he may
[1:21:27] not have even recognized him I preached
[1:21:29] a sermon out of something but Logan told
[1:21:31] me and that but it just it just sparked
[1:21:33] me because God uses all kinds to do that
[1:21:36] but the Joe's done that before Joel's
[1:21:38] never done that but
[1:21:40] some of y'all are inspired
[1:21:45] so
[1:21:46] you know
[1:21:49] you're born a certain way to do a
[1:21:51] certain thing not only encourage us
[1:21:53] tonight
[1:21:54] the man that sang he said was the same
[1:21:56] way to see Visions he says just as
[1:21:58] common to me as it is to them that to do
[1:22:01] that he said you see what I mean now
[1:22:03] it's all together it's for one
[1:22:04] edification of the glory of Jesus Christ
[1:22:06] the son of God
[1:22:09] and brother Branham has asked this
[1:22:10] question he said how does one know their
[1:22:12] rightful position on the body of Christ
[1:22:14] so that's a good question
[1:22:16] how do you rightfully know
[1:22:18] he said what position what in Christ
[1:22:19] what part of Christ do I play I like the
[1:22:21] way he puts that what part of Christ do
[1:22:24] I play
[1:22:25] now for instance I'd say like this
[1:22:27] brother to give you the best answer I
[1:22:29] know your position in Christ is revealed
[1:22:31] to you by the Holy Spirit
[1:22:33] but listen not everything that's
[1:22:35] revealed to you by what you think is the
[1:22:37] holy spirit is the Holy Spirit
[1:22:39] so now he's going to tell you how you
[1:22:41] know it was the Holy Spirit
[1:22:43] he said if you want to know whether it's
[1:22:44] the Holy Spirit or not find out whether
[1:22:46] He blesses what you're doing
[1:22:49] and if he blesses it then that's him
[1:22:51] yeah
[1:22:52] like someone said to me not long ago
[1:22:54] said the Lord called me to preach I said
[1:22:55] well then preach
[1:22:59] that sounds harsh don't it
[1:23:02] but you'll find a place to preach a
[1:23:04] preacher will find a Pulpit a place to
[1:23:05] preach the gift will make room for
[1:23:07] itself
[1:23:08] said he said I really think it's so he
[1:23:11] said Satan if he can just get somebody
[1:23:12] to act like that and then deceive them
[1:23:14] that's just what he wants to do he says
[1:23:16] in the whole world points their finger
[1:23:18] right there because that person crashed
[1:23:19] and burned down the road
[1:23:21] he said somebody thinks they have a gift
[1:23:23] of speaking in tongues and
[1:23:24] interpretation some some has a gift of
[1:23:26] Divine Healing sometimes these things
[1:23:28] like sometimes they're mistaken in those
[1:23:30] things see and sometimes they think they
[1:23:32] haven't got it when they have so it's
[1:23:33] very tricky he said so always do this
[1:23:36] Brethren whenever you feel you're
[1:23:37] supposed to do a thing first find out if
[1:23:40] it's scriptural for you to do it
[1:23:42] if it's in the scripture so say a woman
[1:23:44] felt called to preach that call runs in
[1:23:45] my family
[1:23:47] more strong on the women's side than it
[1:23:49] is on the men's
[1:23:51] but that don't mean they're called to do
[1:23:52] it
[1:23:54] may feel that auction they might have
[1:23:56] ability but it's not scriptural right
[1:23:59] right
[1:24:00] so and don't mean that they don't they
[1:24:02] may be smarter than us and then more
[1:24:04] able and every not be able to preach
[1:24:05] better than us but it does it's not
[1:24:07] scriptural so it's got to be scriptural
[1:24:08] that's just an example another example
[1:24:11] would be a person who's unqualified
[1:24:13] disqualified for some reason still has a
[1:24:15] caller or or has a call but he's
[1:24:17] disqualified himself it's not scriptural
[1:24:19] he said now he said just wrote not just
[1:24:22] wrote in one place but I mean completely
[1:24:23] scriptural Through the Bible for you to
[1:24:25] do it your position he said say if you'd
[1:24:27] be an evangelist Pastor teacher Prophet
[1:24:29] whatever that God might have called you
[1:24:30] to be
[1:24:31] or if you have the gift of tongues the
[1:24:33] gift of interpretation gift of any kind
[1:24:35] of the nine spiritual gifts in the
[1:24:37] church and the four spiritual offices of
[1:24:38] the church any position first see if God
[1:24:41] called he said then usually the way I
[1:24:43] watch it for myself he said this is me
[1:24:45] he said I watch the nature of that
[1:24:47] person and see what kind of a gift that
[1:24:49] they're professing
[1:24:51] see if they're professing to be able to
[1:24:53] sing like a bird or to whistle like a
[1:24:56] bird
[1:24:57] right make a bird whistle you you'd
[1:24:59] expect them to be able to do that
[1:25:01] right
[1:25:02] he said God will work with his creature
[1:25:04] the way he's made him
[1:25:06] he said if you see him real flighty and
[1:25:08] going on he said the Lord called me for
[1:25:10] such and such to be a pastor now a
[1:25:12] pastor can't be a flighty person that's
[1:25:14] why he made me solid see
[1:25:19] you ever notice how many pastors are fat
[1:25:21] sorry
[1:25:24] it's not because we don't work it's just
[1:25:25] because we're solid
[1:25:30] he said God called me to be a teacher he
[1:25:33] said watch him see how he interprets the
[1:25:35] word
[1:25:36] see he gets it all mixed up and
[1:25:37] everything he said and you can tell
[1:25:39] man's not a teacher
[1:25:42] right he said but then the thing to do
[1:25:44] your position is usually known oh this
[1:25:47] is I've we've taught on these things
[1:25:48] before but listen it's not rocket
[1:25:51] science your position is usually known
[1:25:53] whether you can do it or not
[1:25:56] brother Brown tells the story building
[1:25:58] the Tabernacle and and all of that and
[1:26:00] listen to what he says I love the
[1:26:01] humility of a prophet he said my calling
[1:26:04] was an evangelist he said laying right
[1:26:06] here at this Cornerstone if we could
[1:26:07] burst in there tonight you'll see a fly
[1:26:09] leaf off of my Bible where he told me to
[1:26:10] be an evangelist remember do the work of
[1:26:12] an evangelist
[1:26:13] he said and I wasn't a successful pastor
[1:26:16] never would be because I haven't got the
[1:26:19] patience
[1:26:21] because it takes a lot of patience
[1:26:24] he said I haven't got the patience and
[1:26:26] what it takes to be a pastor therefore
[1:26:29] if I tried to Pastor I would be just be
[1:26:32] as far out as a pastor who's trying to
[1:26:34] be an evangelist
[1:26:36] he said see what I mean you can see the
[1:26:38] way the Lord calls you what your
[1:26:41] position is in the body my hand will
[1:26:43] never be my feet
[1:26:45] it wasn't meant to be my feet
[1:26:47] my eyeballs will never be on the bottom
[1:26:49] of my foot
[1:26:51] right it's just not going to be there
[1:26:53] and so over time and again I think
[1:26:56] God allows us sometimes because we're
[1:26:59] small and we're still not a big church
[1:27:01] big group but we've got to thank God for
[1:27:03] those of you step up to the plate but
[1:27:04] God allows us to see you know maybe we
[1:27:07] we pick up and do everything for a while
[1:27:09] there comes a time we don't have to do
[1:27:10] that
[1:27:11] and God allows somebody else to do that
[1:27:13] I thank God for that get out there on
[1:27:15] the front lines
[1:27:16] I want to retire one of these days
[1:27:19] you've heard a pastor say that that's my
[1:27:21] that's my thought now anyway we'll see
[1:27:23] what it is when I'm retirement age
[1:27:25] I want to retire one of these days I
[1:27:27] want to go down on that cabin on the
[1:27:28] Little Red River the last couple days we
[1:27:31] went down there for our anniversary we
[1:27:33] we I preached Sunday and I preach
[1:27:35] Wednesday but in between we went down
[1:27:37] there and and uh it's been a couple days
[1:27:39] on the river and we were in a one-room
[1:27:41] cabin I'll tell you what I could live
[1:27:43] like that
[1:27:44] go out every morning at five o'clock
[1:27:46] while the fish are biting and catch a
[1:27:47] few fish come back up go back in the
[1:27:50] evening and fish I could live the rest
[1:27:51] of my life like that not be bothered
[1:27:53] and and I'll be honest with you and I
[1:27:56] think I think I could do that anyway I
[1:27:58] want to retire some someday somebody
[1:28:00] needs to preach
[1:28:02] and get good at it
[1:28:05] somebody needs to learn how to take care
[1:28:07] of a church
[1:28:09] somebody needs to learn how you you
[1:28:10] understand so we're always training the
[1:28:12] Next Generation we need deacons we need
[1:28:15] trustees we need we need the pastors we
[1:28:17] we need piano players we we need to keep
[1:28:20] invest in the Next Generation
[1:28:22] and be patient with them
[1:28:24] because we won't always be here
[1:28:27] if the Lord tarries and if he doesn't we
[1:28:28] we've not wasted any time by investing
[1:28:30] in people's lives
[1:28:32] because it shows them that you care
[1:28:33] about them
[1:28:35] you can see what the way the Lord calls
[1:28:36] you what your position is in the body
[1:28:38] and then I would say are you still with
[1:28:40] me I'll just be a few more minutes
[1:28:42] what's your motive
[1:28:44] why do you want to
[1:28:47] do whatever
[1:28:48] and and I hope we really examine
[1:28:51] ourselves in that way
[1:28:53] why
[1:28:55] I want to and you feel that call and
[1:28:57] that's not a bad thing he said covet the
[1:28:58] best gifts
[1:29:00] but why
[1:29:01] why do I want to but the brand talks
[1:29:03] about a door of selfishness that we all
[1:29:05] have all of us have it we just have to
[1:29:08] let Christ come in and clean it out
[1:29:11] he said sometimes that gets into
[1:29:13] preachers he said you know sure I'll be
[1:29:15] a minister if everybody passing on the
[1:29:16] back says you're a good fellow so if
[1:29:18] everybody patted me on the back and said
[1:29:19] I was a good fellow I'd get to the altar
[1:29:21] just as quick as I could
[1:29:22] I know there'd be something wrong
[1:29:24] because the Bible says woe unto you and
[1:29:25] all men speak well of you he said the
[1:29:27] world knows its own the world will hate
[1:29:28] you but God will love you and then I
[1:29:30] would add to that what's your motive
[1:29:31] what's your objective
[1:29:33] so you're trying to achieve something is
[1:29:35] it personal
[1:29:37] or is it for the body
[1:29:39] is your objective to be looked at or to
[1:29:41] be seen or to be heard or because I
[1:29:44] would my feelings would be heard if I
[1:29:45] didn't do this or or if I did do it
[1:29:47] maybe my feelings would be hurt but what
[1:29:49] do you want to achieve
[1:29:51] there's got to be a goal what what is
[1:29:53] your goal in doing it
[1:29:55] and brother Brandon says this he said
[1:29:57] you might achieve to say I won't stop
[1:29:59] till I become a preacher I won't stop
[1:30:01] till I become a deacon I won't stop till
[1:30:03] I become a church member he said them
[1:30:05] things are all all right honorable but
[1:30:08] listen here brother don't you stop short
[1:30:10] of Jesus Christ or you haven't got an
[1:30:13] eternal achievement what's your motive
[1:30:15] what's your objective it's got to be
[1:30:16] Christ
[1:30:21] people's motive and objective is Christ
[1:30:23] we can put up with a lot
[1:30:26] if that's the real motive and objective
[1:30:29] but we need to examine ourselves I can't
[1:30:31] do that for you you have to do that he
[1:30:33] said your pastor your work of a pastor
[1:30:35] will soon fade away
[1:30:37] your work work as a deacon will soon go
[1:30:40] I know that's hard but it's true you
[1:30:42] spend all your life some of these
[1:30:43] Brothers Spend decades in a work of a
[1:30:45] deacon and then they're gone for a few
[1:30:47] years now you barely remember
[1:30:49] but it made a difference
[1:30:52] made a difference even on the people who
[1:30:54] don't remember your name
[1:30:56] the people that you met that you they
[1:30:58] don't remember who you are
[1:31:00] right all right brother Harvey I never
[1:31:02] thought that God would put us together
[1:31:03] but I remember brother Harvey when I was
[1:31:06] a young man not much older than these
[1:31:07] young men and I remember brother Harvey
[1:31:09] being at the door of the church and
[1:31:10] greeting us like he does you now
[1:31:13] and it made a difference in my life
[1:31:17] little things makes a difference
[1:31:19] stand at your post to duty you're doing
[1:31:21] something
[1:31:22] and God God knows he sees it you'll be
[1:31:25] rewarded for it makes a difference
[1:31:27] you're always the same you're always
[1:31:29] there and men like brother Danny and I
[1:31:32] called him out because they're Elders
[1:31:33] among us but all of you that that have
[1:31:35] been here Brother David White stood here
[1:31:36] with us all these years and different
[1:31:38] ones brother Harold stood all them years
[1:31:40] and and the elders that are here brother
[1:31:42] Bill sister Karen just having you around
[1:31:45] is such a blessing
[1:31:47] just to have you here you it means
[1:31:49] something for you to be in the house of
[1:31:51] God when you don't feel good and and
[1:31:52] things aren't going right but you're
[1:31:54] you're a shining Beacon to those of us
[1:31:56] of a younger generation who are a little
[1:31:58] softer
[1:32:00] you come up hard
[1:32:02] you come through some rough things
[1:32:03] you've been through some things
[1:32:06] and yet all your work as a deacon will
[1:32:07] soon go your church membership
[1:32:10] will be long dismissed from the minds of
[1:32:11] the people
[1:32:12] just a little while to come but if
[1:32:14] you've achieved Jesus Christ
[1:32:17] you've got eternal life
[1:32:19] and you can never die aren't you glad
[1:32:22] for that today
[1:32:27] if he called you to do a thing like a
[1:32:28] man said
[1:32:29] he said well I believe I can make more
[1:32:31] money if I was a preacher you'll never
[1:32:32] make a preacher
[1:32:34] God has to call you to be a preacher how
[1:32:36] can a preacher preach us the Lord of sin
[1:32:38] is that right he said it's all in God
[1:32:40] everything moves right back into God he
[1:32:43] said everything right back to him he
[1:32:45] sets the program we just fall in line
[1:32:47] and carry it out
[1:32:49] I'll say this last
[1:32:51] how do you represent the body of Christ
[1:32:52] to the world you want to have an office
[1:32:54] how do you represent the body of Christ
[1:32:56] to your community
[1:32:57] is your life worthy of the Gospel if not
[1:33:00] do us all a favor and seek a closer walk
[1:33:02] with God so he can use you
[1:33:04] because you need to be used
[1:33:06] but you young people especially you need
[1:33:08] to watch your life and as you get older
[1:33:10] you'll make mistakes you'll have trouble
[1:33:12] and the church will forgive you for that
[1:33:14] we we're just glad to have you here
[1:33:16] we'll forgive you but you want to make
[1:33:18] sure you keep your life right don't
[1:33:20] don't make those unalterable mistakes
[1:33:23] that'll make it where you can't ever be
[1:33:24] a deacon can't ever be a trustee can't
[1:33:26] ever work for God nobody trusts you
[1:33:28] don't do that
[1:33:29] live for God if you make a mistake come
[1:33:32] right back to God make it right make
[1:33:34] sure there's no arrogance in your heart
[1:33:36] no pride in your heart you're not doing
[1:33:38] what you're doing I'd rather quit
[1:33:39] everything
[1:33:41] and sit down and have one Speck of
[1:33:43] arrogance in my life
[1:33:45] because it'll ruin me and all the only
[1:33:48] thing I'll do is bring a black eye on
[1:33:49] the message
[1:33:51] and I'll bring a black eye on God's
[1:33:52] people Lord if I'm doing it for myself
[1:33:54] Set Me Down
[1:33:58] I wonder if we could have that attitude
[1:34:00] tonight
[1:34:01] see the little things matter we want to
[1:34:03] be in service for the king
[1:34:05] we want to be like the one that his lord
[1:34:07] said in him well done good and faithful
[1:34:09] servant that has been Faithful over a
[1:34:12] few things I'll make the ruler over many
[1:34:14] things enter thou into the joy of thy
[1:34:17] Lord the little things matter our
[1:34:19] attitudes matter
[1:34:21] everything about what we do matters to
[1:34:24] the person beside us
[1:34:26] matters to the persons hiding behind our
[1:34:29] Shield
[1:34:30] Mark 9 41 says for whosoever to give you
[1:34:33] a cup of water to drink in my name
[1:34:35] because you belong to Christ verily I
[1:34:39] say unto you he shall not lose his
[1:34:40] reward
[1:34:41] and I'll say this if they will be
[1:34:43] rewarded what about you who have served
[1:34:45] God's people unselfishly for years
[1:34:49] there will be people in heaven because
[1:34:52] they gave you a cup of cold water
[1:34:58] I think some of those people but Joel we
[1:35:00] grew up around some of them Old Farmers
[1:35:01] and stuff just were nice to us
[1:35:05] the people who gave allowed the owner
[1:35:08] financing for my mom and dad to buy a
[1:35:09] home and raise us kids in
[1:35:11] a little home that it was out there in
[1:35:13] the country it means something to give a
[1:35:15] cup of cold water
[1:35:17] I'm a reader because that that lady
[1:35:20] she opened up her home to me as a young
[1:35:22] man at five years old started buying me
[1:35:24] books she had a library she was an
[1:35:27] educated woman but had given up her
[1:35:28] education and everything to live with a
[1:35:30] farmer and be a farm wife I remember she
[1:35:33] invited me into her library and I got to
[1:35:35] go in there and read those books and
[1:35:37] I've always read and I'm a reader
[1:35:39] thought oh part of my life
[1:35:41] to her doing that
[1:35:43] there will be a reward for that
[1:35:45] but if she will be rewarded
[1:35:47] think about it for a minute what about
[1:35:49] those of you who have done nothing but
[1:35:51] serve the body of Christ it's worth it
[1:35:54] whatever that service is
[1:35:56] find my place what am I best at what am
[1:36:00] I not good at let me figure that out
[1:36:03] what are my best at let me be that
[1:36:05] strong that strength to the church that
[1:36:08] I can be
[1:36:09] great is your reward
[1:36:12] closing with this musicians go ahead and
[1:36:13] come
[1:36:15] he said covet earnestly the best gifts
[1:36:18] and yet
[1:36:20] yet
[1:36:22] we've talked a lot about gifts we talk
[1:36:24] about tongues interpretation and we'll
[1:36:26] have some questions if you have
[1:36:27] questions be sure to let me know I've
[1:36:29] gotten a couple
[1:36:31] if you have questions about the gifts or
[1:36:32] anything for that matter but
[1:36:34] especially about the gifts
[1:36:37] as we're wrapping this this series up
[1:36:39] we've talked a lot about gifts but Paul
[1:36:42] says I'm going to show you a more
[1:36:43] excellent way than seeking gifts
[1:36:46] he said though I speak with the tongues
[1:36:47] of men and of angels
[1:36:49] and have not love
[1:36:52] that word that translated charity in the
[1:36:55] King James version It's Love and in the
[1:36:57] original is agape
[1:36:59] I'm not the love of God
[1:37:01] and become a sounding brass or a
[1:37:04] tinkling
[1:37:05] symbol brother Brandon said there's a
[1:37:08] lot of speaking in tongues a sounding
[1:37:09] brass and tinkling symbols
[1:37:12] a lot of so-called gifts that don't mean
[1:37:15] anything he says this he said friends
[1:37:17] the whole world is dying for love
[1:37:20] so that's one of the great things that
[1:37:21] we leave out of our Pentecostal blessing
[1:37:23] too much of it is love that mixes it
[1:37:26] together
[1:37:27] the mortar that makes gifts
[1:37:30] listen to me the mortar that makes gifts
[1:37:33] and all the things of God operate
[1:37:36] perfectly is love one for the other
[1:37:40] I love you so much that I don't want you
[1:37:43] to be hindered by me stepping out of my
[1:37:45] place
[1:37:47] understand I don't want to imitate a
[1:37:49] prophet because I'm not a prophet and
[1:37:51] for me the imitate a prophet is to step
[1:37:53] out of my place and I love you too much
[1:37:54] to do that
[1:37:56] we need to have that loved one for
[1:37:57] another
[1:37:58] that's the mortar that mixes it all
[1:38:00] together let me stay in my place because
[1:38:03] I love you too much to subject you to me
[1:38:05] being out of my place
[1:38:09] he said that makes gifts and all the
[1:38:10] things of God operate perfectly love one
[1:38:13] for the other would you bow your heads
