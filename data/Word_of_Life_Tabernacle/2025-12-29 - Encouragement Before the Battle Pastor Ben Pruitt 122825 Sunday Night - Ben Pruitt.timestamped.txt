[36:55] piano. We're kind of threw this on the
[36:56] kids, but uh we uh
[37:00] sung this together with them at the
[37:02] house last night for the first time and
[37:05] uh I just really enjoyed it myself and I
[37:08] thought, well, we're going to sing it.
[37:09] if you'll put it up on the um
[37:12] up on the uh board and we y'all can join
[37:16] with us if you know it.
[37:21] Do you love the Lord tonight? Isn't it
[37:23] good to be in the house of the Lord?
[37:29] Sure Peter's mic's on on the piano.
[37:31] [snorts]
[37:42] The Lord is my shepher.
[37:47] He goes [music] before [singing]
[37:49] me,
[37:50] defender behind me.
[37:55] I won't fear.
[38:00] I'm filled with anointing. [singing]
[38:04] My cup's overflowing.
[38:08] Weapon can harm me.
[38:12] I won't fear. [music]
[38:21] Oh, hallelu. [singing]
[38:26] I am not [singing]
[38:29] alone.
[38:34] He's [singing and music] my comfort.
[38:38] Always
[38:40] holds me close. [singing]
[38:42] [music] Does he do that for you?
[38:45] &gt;&gt; Oh yes. Oh, he always guides me.
[38:51] Oh, thank you, Lord.
[38:54] Oh, through mountains and [singing]
[38:57] valleyies.
[39:00] His
[39:03] joy is refreshing.
[39:08] Oh, he restores
[39:12] my soul.
[39:18] &gt;&gt; Mercy and [singing and music] good.
[39:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, sing it now.
[39:26] &gt;&gt; Give [music] me. [singing]
[39:29] Oh yes, Lord.
[39:33] &gt;&gt; Let all see his glory. [singing]
[39:38] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[39:41] &gt;&gt; Face [singing and music] to face.
[39:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, sing [singing] him
[39:51] hallelu.
[39:55] I [singing] am not alone.
[40:03] [singing and music]
[40:03] &gt;&gt; My comfort
[40:06] always
[40:08] holds [music] me close.
[40:13] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. [singing]
[40:18] I am not alone. [singing]
[40:24] Oh, he's my [singing] comfort
[40:30] always [music] holds me [singing] close.
[40:33] Sing that again all together if you know
[40:36] it. Hallelu,
[40:39] [singing]
[40:41] I am not alone. Can you say that
[40:45] tonight? Could you lift your hands to
[40:47] him and sing it? He is my comfort.
[40:52] He always
[40:54] holds me close. Sing it again now. Oh, I
[41:00] [singing]
[41:02] Oh, I am not. Oh, thank God.
[41:09] Oh [singing]
[41:10] yes, he's [music]
[41:12] my comfort
[41:15] always
[41:17] [singing] holding me close.
[41:20] No music. Now sing it. Hallelujah.
[41:24] [singing]
[41:27] I am [music] not alone.
[41:33] Oh, he's [singing] my comfort. [music]
[41:38] Always
[41:40] [singing] holds me close. [music] Sing
[41:43] with the music now. Oh.
[41:47] [singing]
[41:50] I am God. How long can we stand
[41:53] together? Let's sing it [singing] now.
[41:55] Oh, he [music] my
[41:59] [singing]
[42:02] whole me close. One more time. Oh
[42:07] [singing] yes.
[42:09] Hallelujah.
[42:12] I [singing] I am not alone. [music]
[42:17] Oh [singing]
[42:18] yes, he's my
[42:23] always
[42:25] holds me close. [music]
[42:28] Oh, can we just talk to him for a
[42:30] moment?
[42:32] Oh, we love you, Lord Jesus. [music]
[42:35] Oh, Lord Jesus, we're so glad that
[42:37] you're our comfort.
[42:39] You're our shelter in time of trouble.
[42:42] Lord, you said you'd be our pavilion,
[42:46] our tent. Lord, a place we can run into,
[42:49] Lord, in the darkness and and the
[42:51] struggle of life. Oh God, we would know
[42:54] that you're with us. Yay, though I walk
[42:56] through the valley of the shadow of
[42:58] death, yet thou art with me. Lord, I
[43:02] think of those that have lost loved ones
[43:03] this week. I pray you'd bless them
[43:05] abundantly. Lord, comfort them today. Be
[43:08] their comfort.
[43:09] Grant it, Lord Jesus.
[43:12] Lord, I pray for those that are sick and
[43:13] in need, those that are traveling. I
[43:15] pray you'd bless them today. Be their
[43:17] comfort. Oh God, those that are
[43:19] struggling in life. Lord, I pray you'd
[43:21] encourage them today. And Lord, help
[43:24] them to know that you're there for them.
[43:26] We pray in Jesus [music] name. Let's
[43:28] sing that chorus one more time.
[43:30] Hallelujah.
[43:36] I am not alone.
[43:38] Oh, thank you, Lord. Oh, [music] he's my
[43:43] comfort.
[43:45] He always
[43:47] holds me close. And without the music,
[43:51] oh,
[43:54] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[43:56] I am not alone.
[44:01] Thank you, Lord. He my comfort
[44:08] [singing]
[44:10] holds me close.
[44:12] &gt;&gt; Let's just give him a hand of praise
[44:14] today. Oh, aren't you glad he's your
[44:17] comfort? [applause]
[44:18] Hallelujah. And continue standing with
[44:21] me as we open up the word tonight. And
[44:23] just so good to have each and every one
[44:25] of you with us. Remember Wednesday
[44:27] night, Brother Jason Jackson will be
[44:28] with us. We will have some refreshments
[44:30] after the service.
[44:34] We won't we won't be here all night. It
[44:36] won't be a regular watch night service
[44:38] unless brother Jason preaches that long.
[44:39] If he preaches that long, we'll the Dale
[44:42] is shaking his head no back there. But
[44:44] but uh I don't think we're in any danger
[44:46] of that. But uh so y'all will be able to
[44:48] go home if you want to or stay in
[44:50] fellowship. And we're looking forward to
[44:51] that Wednesday night. Amen.
[44:55] Do you love him tonight?
[44:57] &gt;&gt; You glad to be in the house of the Lord?
[44:58] 1st Samuel chapter 30 and verse 6. 1st
[45:01] Samuel 36 30 and6
[45:04] says, "And David was greatly distressed,
[45:08] for the people spake of stoning him. I
[45:10] think I'd be distressed, too,
[45:13] because the soul of all the people was
[45:16] grieved.
[45:17] Every man for his sons and for his
[45:19] daughters, but David encouraged himself
[45:24] in the Lord his God." Pray the Lord
[45:26] would add his blessing to the word. You
[45:28] may be seated this evening.
[45:32] David's situation was drastic.
[45:36] He had gone run from Saul and put out of
[45:41] his own country, run into the country of
[45:44] the Philistines and and the of course
[45:47] he's in a foreign nation. His men that
[45:49] went with him are in a foreign country.
[45:51] They're outcasts, outlaws in their own
[45:54] country. Yet they believed that he would
[45:56] be king. So they put up with the
[45:59] suffering and the worry and the struggle
[46:01] and being away from home because they
[46:03] really believed. I wonder how many here
[46:05] tonight believe that our king is coming.
[46:08] &gt;&gt; Do you really believe he's going to be
[46:09] king?
[46:11] &gt;&gt; The son of David's going to sit on the
[46:12] throne
[46:13] &gt;&gt; during the millennium. We believe that.
[46:15] We believe now he's on the throne of our
[46:17] hearts.
[46:19] But they really believe that. And so
[46:21] they they follow David out into this
[46:23] wilderness place to a little city called
[46:26] Ziglag. And and when they come to this
[46:29] place, then they're off with the
[46:31] Philistines trying to fight with them.
[46:32] The Philistines won't even accept them.
[46:34] And the Philistines run them out of
[46:36] town. And when you get rejected by the
[46:38] Philistines, you really feel bad, you
[46:40] know. And so even even the world didn't
[46:42] want them. They found themselves going
[46:45] home
[46:46] &gt;&gt; to the temporary home that they had made
[46:48] in Ziglag.
[46:50] And when they did, they found that there
[46:53] was nobody there.
[46:56] The city had been burnt. You can imagine
[46:58] them coming up over the hill as they're
[47:00] looking forward to coming home to see
[47:02] their wife or the children.
[47:04] &gt;&gt; And they come up over the hill and they
[47:06] look and the city's been burnt.
[47:08] &gt;&gt; The walls are torn down.
[47:10] and and their their you can imagine the
[47:12] fear that must have come over their
[47:13] hearts.
[47:14] &gt;&gt; Where's our children? Where's our
[47:16] families? They didn't know the Lord had
[47:18] kept their families and their children.
[47:20] None of them had had died, hadn't been
[47:22] killed, but they didn't know that.
[47:24] &gt;&gt; They didn't know what happened to them.
[47:26] They just knew they were missing. And
[47:28] they knew somebody had come and and
[47:30] destroyed the city. Their wives were
[47:32] gone. Their children were gone. They had
[47:34] lost everything
[47:36] &gt;&gt; and they reached such a desperation. The
[47:38] Bible said they wept until they couldn't
[47:41] weep anymore. Have you ever been in that
[47:43] place? You ever been in a place where it
[47:45] felt like, "I've just wept so much I
[47:47] can't weep anymore. I don't have any
[47:49] tears left. My I'm dried up as as David
[47:52] said, like a pot shirt." He said, "I I
[47:54] just don't have anything left to weep
[47:55] with." And and that's the way that they
[47:57] were. They just didn't have anything
[47:58] more to give.
[48:00] &gt;&gt; And in that situation, they began to
[48:03] blame David
[48:05] as people do. They blame leadership or
[48:07] we blame sometimes the Lord because of
[48:10] the situation that we're in. And and
[48:12] they blame David and and David, you
[48:15] know, there's lots of things he could
[48:16] have done. He could have looked down on
[48:18] them, criticized them, and what kind of
[48:20] followers are you and you guys aren't
[48:22] loyal? But that's not what David did.
[48:24] The Bible said when they got ready to
[48:26] stone him,
[48:28] they were literally picking up rocks to
[48:31] stone David. But David encouraged
[48:34] himself in the Lord his God. I want us
[48:39] to look at this as we're ending the old
[48:41] year and we're coming to the new year. I
[48:43] want us to look at this and recognize
[48:45] that there's been many things that have
[48:47] happened this year. But I think no
[48:49] matter what's happened or how hard of a
[48:51] situation that 25 2025 was, as we're
[48:55] entering a new year, I believe that no
[48:57] matter what situation we're in or how
[48:59] hard it's been or how difficult it might
[49:02] be right now, you can encourage yourself
[49:04] in the LORD BECAUSE HE'S NOT JUST
[49:06] DAVID'S GOD. He's your God tonight. HE
[49:09] DON'T JUST BELONG TO THE PREACHERS. HE
[49:11] DON'T JUST BELONG. COME ON, CHURCH. HE
[49:13] DON'T JUST BELONG to a prophet, BUT HE'S
[49:15] MY GOD TODAY. DAVID'S GOD IS MY GOD. IF
[49:18] DAVID ENCOURAGED HIMSELF IN THE LORD HIS
[49:20] GOD, I CAN ENCOURAGE myself in the Lord
[49:23] God.
[49:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. This word encourage means to to
[49:28] grow or to make strong, to prevail, to
[49:32] show courage, to seize or to grasp, to
[49:35] keep a hold of. In in the original, if
[49:37] you run it back to the original Hebrew,
[49:39] it means to strengthen yourself,
[49:42] to heal yourself,
[49:45] to replace or repair the missing part.
[49:50] And sometimes we go through things and
[49:52] we don't realize there's something
[49:53] missing. There's something actually
[49:55] lacking in our faith because of the
[49:58] situations of life that we've been
[49:59] through and we don't even recognize it
[50:01] many times. But that's the time when we
[50:03] need to encourage oursel in the Lord is
[50:06] in that moment when we've gone through a
[50:08] struggle. We've gone through a trial.
[50:09] Some of y'all may not KNOW WHAT I'M
[50:10] TALKING ABOUT, BUT I THINK MOST OF US
[50:12] CAN RELATE BECAUSE WE GO THROUGH THINGS.
[50:14] We live in a IN A IN BODIES OF
[50:16] HUMILIATION. WE LIVE IN A WORLD THAT'S
[50:18] GONE CRAZY. We live in Satan's Eden. AND
[50:20] THE WHOLE WORLD'S GONE GONE CRAZY. And
[50:23] we live in we have to live in that. WE
[50:25] FEEL THE PRESSURE of the age. and and
[50:27] you realize that that THAT THERE MUST BE
[50:29] SOMETHING AS YOU GO OUT IN THE WORLD and
[50:31] you you rub shoulders with the world,
[50:33] there's got to be something to repair
[50:36] YOU, TO RESTORE YOU, TO BRING YOU BACK,
[50:38] TO REPLACE THE MISSING PART. I pray that
[50:40] that would be happen tonight. That if
[50:42] there's something missing from 2025,
[50:45] THAT YOU WOULD GRAB A HOLD OF THAT AND
[50:46] ENCOURAGE YOURSELF IN THE LORD BY
[50:48] STRENGTHENING that missing part.
[50:52] &gt;&gt; David had to encourage himself because a
[50:54] battle was coming.
[50:57] It's hard to fight when you're
[50:59] discouraged.
[51:01] &gt;&gt; See, a battle was coming BECAUSE THE
[51:03] ENEMY HAD TAKEN WHAT was his
[51:06] and he had to take it back.
[51:09] &gt;&gt; It wasn't optional.
[51:11] He couldn't just sit back say, "Well,
[51:13] the enemy stole my my wife. It's too
[51:15] bad.
[51:18] Kind of liked her, but I guess I'll go
[51:19] find another one."
[51:22] &gt;&gt; Well, the enemy took my children. Too
[51:24] bad. I guess I'm still young enough to
[51:26] have some more.
[51:27] &gt;&gt; He couldn't say as we say many times,
[51:29] well, my healing's gone, but you know,
[51:32] it just it just what happens to people
[51:34] like me, or my joy is gone, but you
[51:37] know, it's that kind of an age and just
[51:39] what happens. Or my peace is gone, but
[51:41] it just, you know, everybody's kind of
[51:43] nervous now. And no, he didn't have
[51:45] that. It wasn't optional. It's not
[51:46] optional for us either. If God has given
[51:49] us something, WE NEED TO FIGHT that
[51:51] battle. WE NEED TO FIGHT IT TILL THE
[51:52] DEPRESSION'S GONE. FIGHT IT TILL THE
[51:54] WORY'S GONE. FIGHT IT TILL THE
[51:56] ANXIETYY'S GONE. Young people, ARE YOU
[51:57] LISTENING TO ME? DON'T GIVE IN TO A
[51:59] SPIRIT of fear. DON'T GIVE IN TO A
[52:00] SPIRIT OF UNBELIEF. YOU FIGHT EVERY THE
[52:03] THE GOOD FIGHT OF FAITH UNTIL THE TIME
[52:05] comes that YOU OVERCOME. TILL THE
[52:08] BATTLE'S WON. WHEN DO YOU QUIT FIGHTING?
[52:10] WHEN YOU GET BACK WHAT THE DEVIL STOLE
[52:12] FROM YOU. FIGHT UNTIL THEN. DAVID KNEW A
[52:14] FIGHT WAS COMING. AND IF THERE WAS A
[52:16] FIGHT COMING, HE NEEDED TO RESTORE HIS
[52:18] faith
[52:19] &gt;&gt; before the battle. It's not an optional
[52:22] thing. You don't go to war without first
[52:25] fixing what's wrong with you.
[52:30] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Everybody wants to go
[52:31] to war, BUT YOU DON'T GO TO WAR
[52:33] &gt;&gt; unless you're ready.
[52:35] &gt;&gt; What when do you fix it? You fix it
[52:37] right here today as we're entering a new
[52:39] year. Fix what's broken because a fight
[52:41] is coming. If you're not as on fire for
[52:43] the Lord as you've ever been. If you're
[52:45] NOT IF YOU JUST DON'T FEEL THAT PRESENCE
[52:46] OF GOD IN YOUR HEART LIKE YOU used to.
[52:48] If if you WERE ONCE CLOSER TO GOD THAN
[52:51] YOU ARE NOW, NOW'S THE TIME TO TO
[52:53] ENCOURAGE YOURSELF IN THE LORD TO
[52:55] RESTORE THAT MISSING PART.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[53:01] &gt;&gt; Encourage yourself, David. Fix what's
[53:04] broken.
[53:06] Oh, if I could just
[53:09] &gt;&gt; if I could preach it to myself tonight,
[53:12] &gt;&gt; if I could preach it to pastors, to
[53:13] ministers, to deacons, to trustees, to
[53:15] the people OF THE CHURCH, ENCOURAGE
[53:17] yourself in the Lord.
[53:19] &gt;&gt; IF YOU FIND YOURSELF SHYING AWAY FROM
[53:21] THE HOUSE OF GOD, NOT AS FAITHFUL AS YOU
[53:23] ONCE WERE, ENCOURAGE YOURSELF IN THE
[53:25] LORD.
[53:26] &gt;&gt; IF YOU FIND YOURSELF DOING THINGS THAT
[53:27] YOU WOULDN'T NORMALLY HAVE DONE, AND
[53:29] MAKING EXCUSES for the things THAT
[53:31] YOU'RE DOING, ENCOURAGE YOURSELF IN THE
[53:33] LORD.
[53:36] It wasn't optional. It's not optional
[53:38] today.
[53:40] Our our families aren't optional.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; We can't take them or leave them. We're
[53:44] not. They said, "Well, they may go out
[53:45] in the world. They may not." No, it's
[53:47] not optional.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; We're going to keep our families.
[53:50] &gt;&gt; We're going to keep our joy. We're going
[53:51] to keep our peace. We're going to keep
[53:52] our Come on, Brother Ryan. We're going
[53:54] to keep everything that that belongs to
[53:56] us.
[53:56] &gt;&gt; We're going to keep it. And how are we
[53:58] going to keep it? We're going to fight
[53:59] for it.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; How we going to fight for it? We're
[54:02] going to encourage oursel in the Lord
[54:04] until we go out and fight.
[54:06] &gt;&gt; Come on. Some people stay so discouraged
[54:08] and and stay so carnal in the in their
[54:10] walk THAT THEY CAN'T FIGHT SPIRITUAL
[54:12] BATTLES.
[54:13] &gt;&gt; But you got to encourage yourself in the
[54:15] Lord to fight a spiritual BATTLE. SEE,
[54:17] WE DON'T FIGHT BATTLES against flesh and
[54:19] blood. We fight a spiritual battle with
[54:21] faith. In 1 Thessalonians 3:7, Paul's
[54:24] talking to the Thessalonian church. He
[54:27] said, "Therefore, brethren, we are we
[54:28] were comforted over you in all our
[54:30] affliction and distress by your faith."
[54:32] He said, "For now we live if you stand
[54:35] fast in the Lord." He said, "For what
[54:37] thanks CAN WE RENDER TO GOD AGAIN FOR
[54:39] YOU for all the joy wherewith we joy for
[54:41] your sakes before our God night and day
[54:44] praying exceedingly that we might see
[54:45] your face and might perfect that which
[54:48] is lacking in your faith." To encourage
[54:51] yourself in the Lord is to perfect what
[54:53] is lacking in your faith. IT'S NOT JUST
[54:57] TO HYPE YOURSELF UP,
[54:59] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? IT'S NOT JUST TO MAKE YOURSELF
[55:01] FEEL GOOD, but if there's something
[55:03] missing in your faith, encourage
[55:06] yourself in the Lord.
[55:08] &gt;&gt; And and so this is something that that
[55:11] Paul wants to do for the people. Brother
[55:12] Random always tried to encourage the
[55:13] faith of the people. He talks to I'm
[55:16] going to read a couple of quotes where
[55:17] brother Brandham talks to a person who's
[55:19] blind.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; I can't think of a much more difficult
[55:23] situation than to not be able to see.
[55:25] That's right.
[55:27] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham is talking to a
[55:29] blind woman who comes up before him.
[55:32] He said, "Sometimes we just accept
[55:35] things, church. We don't need to just
[55:36] accept it.
[55:37] &gt;&gt; We need to ask God to heal us."
[55:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; And this little woman didn't just accept
[55:41] blindness. She said, "I believe there's
[55:44] a healer."
[55:45] &gt;&gt; So she comes up before a prophet and he
[55:47] said, "This poor little mother standing
[55:48] here, he's praying." He said, "She's
[55:50] blind. Lord, you know her. I'm just a
[55:53] man. I've tried to represent you. Push
[55:55] back the blackness for her. Will you,
[55:58] Lord, break forth sight in these blinded
[56:02] eyes.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; I pray the Lord would do that tonight.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:07] &gt;&gt; He said, "We don't ask for miracles,
[56:09] Lord, BUT JUST SOMETHING TO encourage
[56:12] her."
[56:13] So, Brother Brandham, recognizing the
[56:15] battle that's coming to this blind woman
[56:17] in her faith, HE SAID, "GIVE her
[56:19] something to encourage her so she'll BE
[56:22] ABLE TO FIGHT THIS FIGHT." SO, we don't
[56:26] always get miracles. Many times God
[56:27] heals us. It's over time, JT. And and
[56:30] and we need a little glimpse of the
[56:32] supernatural.
[56:35] OH, CHURCH, WE CAN OPEN UP OUR BLINDED
[56:37] EYES. THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO FIGHT TO
[56:38] HAVE GOOD SERVICES. WE DON'T NEED JUST
[56:40] MAIL IN CHURCH. WE NEED TO FIGHT FOR THE
[56:42] PRESENCE OF THE LORD. FIGHT FOR GOD TO
[56:44] BE IN OUR MIDST. WHY? BECAUSE WE NEED A
[56:46] LITTLE GLIMPSE [snorts]
[56:48] &gt;&gt; OF SUPERNATURAL TO GIVE US COURAGE TO
[56:50] KEEP BELIEVING. ONE DAY OUR BODIES ARE
[56:52] GOING TO BE NEW. ONE DAY THERE THERE'S
[56:53] going to be Come on, THERE'S GOING TO BE
[56:55] A NEW BODY. THERE'S GOING TO BE A CHANGE
[56:56] OF BODY. BUT UNTIL THAT DAY HAPPENS, LET
[56:59] ME CATCH A GLIMPSE OF THE SUPERNATURAL.
[57:01] AMEN.
[57:01] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; He said, he said, "Let her know that
[57:07] you're the son of God and I be your
[57:08] servant, Lord, to tell them the truth. I
[57:11] believe if you'd do it, Lord, everyone
[57:13] in here would accept you." Right? Then,
[57:15] please do. He said, "I want you hear my
[57:17] prayer. I ask you with all my heart in
[57:19] Jesus name." Then he speaks to the
[57:22] devil. He said, "Now, Satan, this duel
[57:24] of faith, you claim her and I claim her
[57:27] for Jesus.
[57:29] I claim that you have no power over her.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; I CLAIM THAT YOU HAVE NO POWER OVER
[57:35] NOTHING.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; He said, "JESUS CHRIST, MY LORD,
[57:39] STRIPPED and robbed you of everything.
[57:40] You've had every legal rights at
[57:42] Calvary."
[57:43] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[57:43] &gt;&gt; I STAND HERE AS HIS REPRESENTATIVE AND
[57:46] YOU KNOW HE'S ON THE PLATFORM. YOU KNOW
[57:48] ALL ABOUT THIS GIFT. I love that.
[57:50] &gt;&gt; He said, "You know all ABOUT THIS GIFT."
[57:52] THE DEVIL KNEW THAT THAT GIFT was from
[57:54] God.
[57:54] &gt;&gt; He knew it never failed. He he said, "I
[57:57] I YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT THIS GIFT. YOU KNOW
[57:59] ABOUT WHERE HE MINISTERED AND HOW he did
[58:01] it." Hallelujah. He's talking to the
[58:03] devil. He said, "I charge you BY THE
[58:04] LIVING GOD. YOU COME OUT OF the woman.
[58:06] Leave her in Jesus Christ's name." He
[58:08] said, "Every head bowed. Let me see your
[58:09] eyes first." He said, "I'll call you if
[58:11] something happens." He said, "Now just
[58:13] raise your head. Can you see me? Put
[58:15] your hands on my nose." He said, "Amen.
[58:17] Open your eyes. The woman can see.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; She's got her sight." Brother Brandham
[58:22] explains that a little bit more when he
[58:23] prays for another woman.
[58:26] See the woman was healed.
[58:29] But brother Brandham explains that there
[58:31] was a battle coming after her healing.
[58:35] Now brother, he said, "Now keep your
[58:37] head bowed just a moment. I'm not asking
[58:39] that this has to be done for a sign, but
[58:42] I'm asking that Christ will just do a
[58:43] little something here to encourage her."
[58:47] He said, "A blind person always seems to
[58:50] be oh so tore up or something, just
[58:53] sitting in a dark world." He said, "NOW
[58:56] EVERYBODY JUST BE SILENTLY AND IN PRAYER
[58:58] WITH YOUR HEADS BOUND." He said, "Now,
[58:59] as you have your eyes over the lids,
[59:01] lids over your eyeballs, now hold that
[59:03] way just a moment." He said, "Now I want
[59:05] you to look directly at me in Christ's
[59:06] name. Can you see me?" You can see me.
[59:09] Wonderful. Touch my nose. Well, bless
[59:11] the Lord. Open your eyes, everybody. She
[59:13] can see. The Lord has healed her. He
[59:14] said, "Just touch my nose, lady." Amen.
[59:16] He said, "Let's just say because if she
[59:18] was able to touch his nose, she was able
[59:19] to see his nose,
[59:22] right? Can you?" He said, "Let's just
[59:24] say, "Praise the Lord." He said, "Can
[59:25] you show us lights right here?" The lady
[59:27] said, "Yes, the light." All right. Why
[59:28] she count them. Just go to counting down
[59:30] and show me. Just go on with your
[59:32] fingers saying like pointing to them so
[59:33] they can see. Can you imagine the faith
[59:35] that's building in this woman as she's
[59:36] beginning to see and she's able to touch
[59:38] his nose and she's able to begin to see
[59:40] the lights and she counts them. One 2 3
[59:43] 4. It wasn't just FOR THE AUDIENCE, BUT
[59:44] IT WAS for her.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; Right. She begins to count the lights.
[59:49] And and and she begins to do that. And
[59:51] he said, "Just go along with your
[59:53] fingers and pointing to them." Yes.
[59:54] There. And there and there and there.
[59:55] Let's just say, "Praise the Lord." He
[59:58] said, "What happened?" God bless you,
[59:59] mother. Go right off the platform
[1:00:01] rejoicing. What? She's walking by
[1:00:03] herself.
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; He said, "Let's say, praise the Lord."
[1:00:06] Somebody led her up there.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; But she walked back by herself.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; He said, "Let's bow our heads now and
[1:00:12] thank him. Heavenly Father, we thank
[1:00:13] thee tonight. Thou dost restore sight to
[1:00:16] the blind. And now, Lord, we realize
[1:00:18] this little woman, may these eyes
[1:00:19] continually. Brother Brandham, he's a
[1:00:21] prophet. He's he's got maturity. He
[1:00:23] understands, you know, a lot of us, we
[1:00:25] we'd see that and we'd run all over the
[1:00:26] building. Well, praise God, she's it's a
[1:00:29] miracle. And brother Brandham recognizes
[1:00:30] the devil's going to fight this woman.
[1:00:33] So, what does he say? He said, he said,
[1:00:36] "May these eyes continually as that
[1:00:37] spirit left and sight be to creep into
[1:00:40] her eyes again, it elated her, Lord, it
[1:00:44] made her happy as it would."
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; He said, "It makes us happy." Yes, sir.
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; He said, "I pray that it'll it'll
[1:00:51] continue to grow in her sight, in her
[1:00:55] eyes, until she's perfectly normal
[1:00:57] again." He said, "I ask in Jesus name
[1:01:00] and thank you for what you've done."
[1:01:01] Now, Brother Ram goes on to explain. He
[1:01:03] talked about how that he said if I put a
[1:01:05] transparent band around your nerves,
[1:01:09] he said it would it would it would uh
[1:01:11] keep the blood flow from going to your
[1:01:13] eyes and he said it would cause
[1:01:16] blindness. Said the same thing with a
[1:01:17] man that couldn't speak.
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; Said it would he said and that devil he
[1:01:21] said got around those nerves
[1:01:24] right and and and crushed them together
[1:01:27] and made it where they the blood
[1:01:28] couldn't flow. And then he says this. He
[1:01:31] said, "Now what it is, the Bible says
[1:01:33] it's a blind spirit." He said, "How many
[1:01:35] knows that?" The Bible says it's a death
[1:01:36] spirit, a dumb spirit. Is that right? He
[1:01:38] said, "Well, the spirit has cut off the
[1:01:39] circulation." He said, "Reme." Now,
[1:01:42] remove that. So, if you remove the band
[1:01:44] or the spirit,
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; he said, "Of course, it'll be sore a
[1:01:47] little bit, but circulation starts
[1:01:48] back."
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; If nature's not hindered,
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; it'll work perfect. See, so many times
[1:01:54] what we're looking for is a miracle when
[1:01:56] really what we need is just for nature
[1:01:58] to be able to work,
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; right? But that spirit's got to come off
[1:02:03] first,
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; are you with me now?
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; That's the same way a person suffering
[1:02:09] with depression or anxiety or anything
[1:02:11] like that, that spirit needs to leave so
[1:02:13] your body CAN HEAL,
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; SO YOUR MIND CAN HEAL.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; Sometimes it happens instantly, but many
[1:02:20] times it's a healing.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; IT TAKES TIME. DON'T GIVE UP ON YOUR
[1:02:24] HEALING because it didn't HAPPEN RIGHT
[1:02:25] AWAY. ENCOURAGE YOURSELF IN THE LORD.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; SO, BROTHER BRANDON SAID, "Let her see a
[1:02:30] little supernatural. It'll encourage
[1:02:32] her." So, she was able to see. But now,
[1:02:35] watch. He said, "When the he said,
[1:02:37] remove that. It'll be sore a little bit,
[1:02:38] but circulation starts back. If nature's
[1:02:40] not hindered, it'll work perfect." He
[1:02:42] said, and and he said, "The devil
[1:02:45] hinders nature. When it does, there it
[1:02:47] is. Then move the cause. The cure is
[1:02:48] sure." He said, "Now, when the blind
[1:02:50] spirit went out, she could see. That's
[1:02:52] all. If she'll keep believing, if she'll
[1:02:55] keep believing, someone say it with me
[1:02:56] tonight. Keep believing.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; If she'll keep believing, in about 24
[1:03:00] hours, she'll be seeing better all the
[1:03:02] time.
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; THEN ABOUT 72 HOURS, SHE MAY GO TOTALLY
[1:03:06] BLIND AGAIN.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; And we would look at that many times as
[1:03:11] a as a failure in healing, but that's
[1:03:12] not what it is.
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; THE BODY'S GOT TO HEAL ITSELF. ALL
[1:03:19] RIGHT.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; ENCOURAGE YOURSELF IN THE LORD SO THAT
[1:03:22] YOUR MIND CAN BE HEALED, SO YOUR BODY
[1:03:24] CAN BE HEALED.
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; He said, "Then after that, if she'll
[1:03:29] just keep on believing, then it'll start
[1:03:31] coming back and be normal again." All
[1:03:34] right? If she just believed, don't
[1:03:35] doubt, but have faith. He said the same
[1:03:37] thing about cancer. Many times a cancer
[1:03:39] would die, the spirit would die, and the
[1:03:41] cancer would fall off, get on the
[1:03:42] bloodstream, make the person sick.
[1:03:44] They'd think they weren't healed, and
[1:03:45] the spirit would come back on them.
[1:03:48] Are you with me now?
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, that's not biblical." It
[1:03:51] is. Jesus healed two blind men like
[1:03:53] that. One of them, it said he he he spit
[1:03:55] in the ground. He made clay, put it on
[1:03:57] his eyes, and and he said, "Can you
[1:03:58] see?" And the man said, "I see tree men
[1:04:00] like trees walking." Right? It didn't
[1:04:02] happen all at once, but the second touch
[1:04:04] restored his sight.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Oh, that we could be encouraged
[1:04:08] by the first touch that WE GET THAT THE
[1:04:11] SECOND TOUCH WILL be a complete and
[1:04:12] total healing. Do you believe he can do
[1:04:14] that for you tonight?
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. David got desperate for this kind
[1:04:18] of encouragement.
[1:04:20] He said, "I'm just going to encourage
[1:04:22] myself."
[1:04:24] SEE, BECAUSE SOMETIMES THE PASTOR CAN'T
[1:04:26] DO IT FOR YOU. SOMETIMES THE CHURCH
[1:04:28] CAN'T DO IT FOR YOU. SOMETIMES WHEN
[1:04:29] YOU'RE ALL ALONE AND EVERYBODY'S ABOUT
[1:04:31] TO STONE YOU, you need to encourage
[1:04:33] yourself in the Lord. I NEED TO
[1:04:34] ENCOURAGE myself in the Lord. Yes,
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; sir.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says this. HE SAID,
[1:04:38] "THERE'S SOME HERE, LORD, that even
[1:04:39] holds this token that I spoke of. They
[1:04:41] have possessed that token and yet
[1:04:42] they're sick."
[1:04:44] How many could say you've had sickness
[1:04:46] in your body,
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; right? At some point in your life
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; and and at during that time, like if
[1:04:51] you've GOT THE HOLY GHOST, YOU'VE HAD
[1:04:53] THE HOLY GHOST AND been sick,
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; So, the Holy Ghost is what you need to
[1:04:58] get rid of it.
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah, you have the token. So, YEAH,
[1:05:01] YOU'RE SICK. HE SAID, I WANT TO SPEAK
[1:05:02] TONIGHT on giving them courage TO
[1:05:05] ENCOURAGE THEM TO TAKE THAT GOD-GIVEN
[1:05:07] RIGHTS.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; THEY have a right to defeat that devil.
[1:05:10] He's already defeated. He's just
[1:05:12] bluffing them. He said, "I'm claiming
[1:05:14] them, Father. Preach with me tonight,
[1:05:16] church. I I I'm I'm giving everything I
[1:05:18] got. So, you just hang with me." He
[1:05:20] said, "Now, HELP ME TO SPEAK THE WORD.
[1:05:22] YOU SPEAK through me, Lord, WITH THIS
[1:05:23] FEW NOTES I GOT WROTE DOWN HERE AND A
[1:05:25] LITTLE SCRIPTURES WROTE OUT. I PRAY
[1:05:26] YOU'LL HELP ME, LORD. Get in the word
[1:05:28] and give them faith for the glory of
[1:05:30] God." He preached that in the message
[1:05:31] called desperations.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; He preached a token and then he preached
[1:05:35] desperations. Yeah.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; He said because even even Holy Ghost
[1:05:38] fililled people need to get desperate to
[1:05:41] encourage themselves in the Lord.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; How did David encourage himself?
[1:05:47] We're told how he did it in 1st Samuel
[1:05:48] 37. David said to Abiar the priest, aim
[1:05:52] son, I pray thee, bring me hither the
[1:05:54] ephod. And Abiar brought hither the
[1:05:56] ephod to David. And David inquired at
[1:06:00] the Lord, saying, shall I pursue after
[1:06:02] this troop? Shall I overtake them? And
[1:06:06] he answered him, "Pursue, for thou shalt
[1:06:09] surely overtake them and without fail
[1:06:12] recover." What does it say there? Oh,
[1:06:16] hallelujah.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; So he said, "Bring me the ephod." Now,
[1:06:20] why would he have him bring him the
[1:06:22] ephod? Because the ephod I know you've
[1:06:24] heard this before, but just just bear
[1:06:26] with me for a moment. The ephod was a
[1:06:28] garment worn by the priest which was
[1:06:29] used to determine God's will. Because on
[1:06:31] the ephod was the urum and thumbum,
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; right? The yurum and the thumbum. It was
[1:06:36] the breastplate of Aaron.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; Exodus 28:30, thou shalt put in the
[1:06:40] breastplate of judgment. The yurum and
[1:06:41] the thumbum. They shall be upon Aaron's
[1:06:43] heart. I like that. The yum and thumb is
[1:06:45] the word. And the word is supposed to be
[1:06:47] on the heart of the minister.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; They shall be upon Aaron's heart. And
[1:06:50] when he goeth in before the Lord, Aaron
[1:06:52] shall bear the judgment of the children
[1:06:54] of Israel upon his heart before the Lord
[1:06:56] continually. So it was this yurum and
[1:06:58] thumbum that would say that would tell
[1:06:59] whether a prophecy was true or not.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; Right. Because if it was according to if
[1:07:06] it was right if a prophet prophesied or
[1:07:09] a dreamer told a dream there would be a
[1:07:11] supernatural light that would flash
[1:07:14] across the room and thumbum
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; and brother that the meaning of that is
[1:07:18] lights and perfections. That's what
[1:07:20] yurum thumbum means. So, brother Brandon
[1:07:22] says the German thumb was it was the
[1:07:24] breastplate, the ephod that Aaron wore.
[1:07:26] It was always God always has been a
[1:07:28] supernatural God answering in
[1:07:30] supernatural ways. And when a prophet
[1:07:32] prophesied, so see when David called for
[1:07:34] that, he was calling for the word of a
[1:07:37] prophet and he wanted to make sure that
[1:07:39] the ephod WAS THERE SO HE WOULD KNOW IF
[1:07:41] THE PROPHET WAS TELLING the truth,
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; sir.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; Right? Are you with me now?
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE A WORD PROPHET SPEAKS THE WORD.
[1:07:48] RIGHT.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said, he makes the
[1:07:51] statement only a prophet can only be
[1:07:52] vindicated by the word.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; Even though we have vindications of the
[1:07:56] pillar of fire and all these things that
[1:07:57] happen, but yet those are word
[1:08:00] vindications. It's vindication found in
[1:08:02] the word that was supposed to happen in
[1:08:04] this day. Actually, what v what
[1:08:06] vindicates brother Brandham is the word
[1:08:07] of God. The word itself vindicates the
[1:08:10] prophet. HE SAID, "BEHOLD, I'LL SEND YOU
[1:08:12] ELIJAH THE PROPHET BEFORE THE COMING OF
[1:08:13] THE great and dreadful day of the Lord.
[1:08:15] He shall turn the hearts of the children
[1:08:16] back to THE FATHERS." HE SENT ELIJAH. HE
[1:08:18] DID WHAT HE SAID HE would do. AND THE
[1:08:20] WORD BECAME the vindication.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? THE SUPERNATURAL
[1:08:25] LIGHT FLASHED ACROSS THE GERMAN THUMBUM.
[1:08:27] When a prophet prophesied and them
[1:08:29] mystic lights didn't come across that
[1:08:30] year and thumbum, he was wrong. When a
[1:08:32] dreamer told a dream, if it didn't flash
[1:08:33] on that yman thumbum, I don't care how
[1:08:35] good it sounded, he was wrong.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; I smiled because I had a dream last
[1:08:40] night.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; I told some of the brothers, but I'm not
[1:08:43] sure this was spiritual at all. Uh,
[1:08:45] Brother Jeremy's outright at the moment.
[1:08:47] It's probably a good thing. I dreamed
[1:08:49] that he sung a special.
[1:08:52] Brother [snorts] Jeremy and Sister
[1:08:53] Rebecca sang a special. I can tell you
[1:08:55] what you're saying, too. You know, I'm
[1:08:57] not sure that's prophecy.
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; But but see when the
[1:09:06] that dreams got would have to in the Old
[1:09:08] Testament would have to be shown when
[1:09:11] when I told it it'd have to flash across
[1:09:13] the German thumbum or they couldn't
[1:09:15] accept it.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; Right? Because some dreams come from
[1:09:18] eating too much.
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham said that
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; some dreams come from eating too much.
[1:09:24] He said but but uh some people are
[1:09:26] spiritual dreamers.
[1:09:28] But when a prophet prophesied, when a
[1:09:30] person dreamed a dream, it had to flash
[1:09:32] on the German thumb. He said, "I don't
[1:09:33] care how good it sounded." It was wrong.
[1:09:34] He said, "I DON'T CARE JUST EXACTLY HOW
[1:09:36] MANY DOCTOR'S DEGREES YOU GOT, HOW BIG
[1:09:37] YOUR ORGANIZATION IS. WHEN YOU PROPHESY
[1:09:39] OR PREACH, if it ain't according to this
[1:09:42] word, you're wrong, brother. This is
[1:09:43] God's THUMB." SO, DAVID SAID, "I'M GOING
[1:09:45] TO ENCOURAGE MYSELF IN THE LORD BY
[1:09:48] BRINGING THE WORD, THE VINDICATED WORD,
[1:09:50] TO ME SO I can see what's real and
[1:09:52] what's not. AND I WANT TO SEE, ARE WE
[1:09:55] SUPPOSED TO GO AFTER THE AMALACHITES?
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND GOD SAID, "GO AND
[1:10:01] RECOVER ALL."
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; Are you with me so far?
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; He said, "Now, the older ironic ironic
[1:10:08] priesthood is done away with, but we've
[1:10:10] still got a yer and thumbum."
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said, "THIS IS THE
[1:10:14] REVELATION OF Jesus Christ reveals him
[1:10:16] in this word." How many believe that
[1:10:18] tonight?
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; This is God's German thumbum.
[1:10:21] Listen, what did David do? He encouraged
[1:10:23] himself with the light and perfection.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, I love that.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; You want TO ENCOURAGE YOURSELF, OPEN UP
[1:10:30] THE LIGHT and the perfection.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; And see if God won't vindicate it in
[1:10:34] your life.
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; The light and listen, your ideas, and
[1:10:38] that's why it's so important WE DON'T
[1:10:39] MAKE OUR IDEAS SCRIPTURE.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; We may have an idea about something, but
[1:10:43] that's not the scripture. That's not the
[1:10:45] word of God. BUT IF IT COME FROM THE
[1:10:47] WORD, it's the yurum and thumbum. And
[1:10:49] it'll work in your life. It'll work in
[1:10:51] your family. Everybody can tell you how
[1:10:53] to get along. Everybody can TELL YOU HOW
[1:10:54] TO MAKE YOUR MARRIAGE WORK. EVERYBODY
[1:10:56] CAN TELL YOU HOW TO HOW to discipline
[1:10:57] your kids. BUT IF IT COME FROM THE WORD,
[1:10:59] IT'S RIGHT.
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; Are you with ME NOW?
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; ENCOURAGE YOURSELF IN WHAT YOU KNOW TO
[1:11:05] BE THE TRUTH. YES,
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; SIR.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Because the world's GOING TO
[1:11:10] MAKE IT SEEM LIKE THAT THAT despair is
[1:11:12] the truth and depression IS THE TRUTH
[1:11:14] AND UNGODLINESS IS THE TRUTH AND AND YOU
[1:11:16] DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU'RE A BOY OR A
[1:11:17] GIRL. BUT COME BACK TO THE WORD AND
[1:11:20] ENCOURAGE YOURSELF IN THE URUM AND THE
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; THUMBUM.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; AMEN. The word vindicated David's
[1:11:28] present course of action. I WANT TO
[1:11:30] CHALLENGE US TODAY AS WE GO INTO 2026.
[1:11:33] DOES THE WORD VINDICATE OUR PRESENT
[1:11:35] COURSE OF ACTION. BROTHER BEN, WHY DO
[1:11:36] YOU PREACH? BECAUSE THE WORD VINDICATES
[1:11:39] MY PRESENT COURSE OF ACTION.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? HE SAID, "PREACH THE WORD. Be
[1:11:44] instant in season, out of season.
[1:11:46] Reprove, REBUKE WITH ALL LONGSUFFERING
[1:11:47] AND DOCTRINE. SO THAT'S WHAT I GOT TO
[1:11:49] DO. WHY? The light flashed across the
[1:11:51] urum and the thumb. A WORD PROPHET COME
[1:11:53] AND SAID, PREACHER, HE SAID, GET OUT IN
[1:11:55] THE IN GET YOU A PULPIT AND PREACH. SO
[1:11:57] I'M GOING TO PREACH.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, IF YOU'RE A PREACHER, YOU
[1:12:00] PREACH YOUR MESSAGE. IF YOU'RE NOT A
[1:12:01] PREACHER, HE SAID, DON'T TRY TO PREACH.
[1:12:02] YOU LIVE YOUR MESSAGE.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; Live your gospel.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:09] SO THE WORD VINDICATES OUR PRESENT
[1:12:11] COURSE OF ACTION. SO, we should examine
[1:12:14] ourselves and it will encourage us when
[1:12:16] we recognize, yeah, the thing that I'm
[1:12:19] DOING IS ACCORDING TO THE WORD.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; I mean,
[1:12:25] if you're sitting there, no one here's
[1:12:28] thinking like this, but if a man's
[1:12:29] sitting there, it's like, I'm going to
[1:12:30] leave my family.
[1:12:32] I'm gonna go out and divorce my wife and
[1:12:34] marry another. Does the word vindicate
[1:12:38] your present course of action?
[1:12:43] Someone say, "Well, I'm going to I'm
[1:12:45] just going to give up. I'm gonna quit
[1:12:46] going to church. Them people are a bunch
[1:12:47] of hypocrites anyway." Does the word
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; vindicate your present course of action?
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; David's about to fight a battle and he
[1:12:57] needs to encourage himself in the Lord.
[1:12:59] Does the word vindicate what I'm about
[1:13:00] to do? Does the word say that this is
[1:13:03] what I should do? His wife and children
[1:13:05] have been taken by the Amalachites. Now,
[1:13:07] remember who Amalecch was. Exodus 17:14,
[1:13:10] the Lord said to Moses, "Write this for
[1:13:12] a memorial in a book, rehearse it in the
[1:13:14] years of Joshua, I WILL UTTERLY PUT OUT
[1:13:16] the remembrance of Amalecch from under
[1:13:18] heaven." So, there are some nations that
[1:13:20] God has a he has a a bigger uh problem
[1:13:24] with than others
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; in the scripture. You realize that
[1:13:27] there's some nations that, you know,
[1:13:29] they kind of lived alongside them and
[1:13:31] things, but there's some he said, "I
[1:13:32] want you to make sure you do away with
[1:13:34] them."
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; He said, "WHEN YOU MEET THEM, GET RID OF
[1:13:37] THEM.
[1:13:38] Are you with me now?
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; There's some things WE CAN'T MAKE A
[1:13:42] partnership with.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; We can't cut a deal with.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; So, as we enter the new year, let's look
[1:13:48] at it and see the things that I have in
[1:13:50] my life. Are they marked OUT FOR
[1:13:52] DESTRUCTION OR are they marked out for
[1:13:54] my good?
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; And if it's marked out for destruction,
[1:13:59] cigarettes are marked out for
[1:14:00] destruction.
[1:14:03] Prophet of God said, "I don't see how
[1:14:04] you can make I don't see how you can
[1:14:06] make a a rapture smoking cigarettes. I
[1:14:08] want to go in the rapture."
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Lust is marked out for
[1:14:14] destruction.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; UNGODLY LIVING IS MARKED OUT FOR
[1:14:17] DESTRUCTION.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? SELFISHNESS IS
[1:14:22] MARKED OUT FOR DESTRUCTION.
[1:14:24] [laughter]
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; DEPRESSION IS MARKED out for
[1:14:26] destruction. GOD SAID, "GET RID OF IT.
[1:14:29] DON'T DON'T DON'T SIT ON IT. DON'T DON'T
[1:14:30] DON'T MESS WITH IT. DON'T DON'T BABY IT.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN SOMETHING'S ALREADY MARKED OUT
[1:14:38] FOR DESTRUCTION IN THE WORD AND YOU CAN
[1:14:40] SEE THIS IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE IN MY
[1:14:42] LIFE, THEN THAT OUGHT TO ENCOURAGE YOU
[1:14:43] IN THE LORD. WHEN YOU HEAR THAT
[1:14:45] PREACHED, IT OUGHT TO BE SOMETHING IN
[1:14:46] YOUR LIFE. YOU SAY, "LORD, I KNOW I'VE
[1:14:48] LOST THE BATTLE IN 2025, BUT I'M GOING
[1:14:50] TO WIN IT IN 2026. THIS THING THAT'S
[1:14:52] MARKED OUT FOR DESTRUCTION IN MY LIFE
[1:14:54] WILL BE DESTROYED."
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; OH, come on, CHURCH. THAT DEPRESSION
[1:14:58] WILL BE DESTROYED. THAT UNGODLINESS WILL
[1:15:00] BE DESTROYED. THAT EVIL SPEAKING WILL BE
[1:15:03] DESTROYED. ALL THAT GOSSIP AND NONSENSE
[1:15:04] IN MY LIFE, IT'S GOING TO BE DESTROYED
[1:15:07] BECAUSE IT'S ALREADY MARKED OUT FOR
[1:15:08] DESTRUCTION IN THE WORD.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:15:14] [snorts]
[1:15:16] The Lord said, "I will utterly put out
[1:15:18] the remembrance of Amalecch from under
[1:15:19] heaven." Verse 15, Moses built an altar
[1:15:22] and called the name of it Jehovani.
[1:15:25] Jehovani.
[1:15:26] For he said, "Because the Lord has sworn
[1:15:28] that the Lord will have war
[1:15:31] with Amalecch from generation to
[1:15:34] generation."
[1:15:36] Amalecch was an evil nation. Numbers 24
[1:15:38] and 20, it says, "When he looked on
[1:15:40] Amalecch, he took up his parable." I
[1:15:41] believe this is Balam's prophecy. He
[1:15:43] said, "Amalecch was the first of the
[1:15:45] nations, but his latter end shall shall
[1:15:47] be that he perish forever."
[1:15:49] Deuteronomy 25:17. Remember what
[1:15:52] Amalecch did unto thee by the way. When
[1:15:54] you were come forth out of Egypt, how he
[1:15:56] met thee by the way, and smoked the
[1:15:58] hindmost of thee, even all that were
[1:16:01] feeble behind thee. When thou was faint
[1:16:03] and weary, he feared not God. Now look,
[1:16:06] don't don't you realize, aren't you
[1:16:08] tired of getting taken advantage of by
[1:16:09] the devil?
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; Now, come on. It's turning a new year.
[1:16:12] We don't turn a new leaf, but but we we
[1:16:14] do want to we do want to make the mark
[1:16:16] the time and say, you know what? I'm
[1:16:18] done with the devil always attacking me
[1:16:20] at my weakest.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; I'm ready to GO FORWARD AND ATTACK THE
[1:16:24] DEVIL.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; I'm ready TO DO SOME SOME FIGHTING
[1:16:27] THAT'S NOT ME RUNNING.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? IF I'M RUNNING, LET ME RUN
[1:16:33] FORWARD
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; LIKE DAVID DID TO ME GOLIATH.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; And he SAID HE FEARED NOT GOD. HE HE
[1:16:40] JUST TOOK THE DO TOOK YOU AT YOUR WORST
[1:16:42] AT YOUR WORST MOMENT. Your worst YOUR
[1:16:43] WORST MOMENT. AND HE ACTUALLY CAUSED YOU
[1:16:46] TO HE CAUSED YOU the the weary to be
[1:16:49] defeated, the little children to be
[1:16:50] defeated.
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; Verse 19, therefore it shall be when the
[1:16:54] Lord thy God has given thee rest from
[1:16:55] all THINE ENEMIES ROUNDABOUT IN THE land
[1:16:57] which the Lord thy God giveth thee for
[1:16:58] an inheritance to possess it, THOU SHALT
[1:17:00] BLOT OUT THE REMEMBRANCE OF AMALECCH
[1:17:02] FROM UNDER HEAVEN. IF THAT THING
[1:17:04] DESTROYED YOUR LIFE, IF IT BOTHERED YOU
[1:17:06] THAT MUCH, LET 2026 be a year that is
[1:17:09] completely destroyed. Amen.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; Don't play with it.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; Kids get suicidal thoughts and things.
[1:17:19] Don't play with that.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; Not just kids.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; You dwell on your own misery. And
[1:17:30] devil's favorite part is a pity party.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; It's his favorite thing to attend. He
[1:17:36] just sits back there and drinks his tea,
[1:17:38] you know, with his little
[1:17:40] drinks his tea, sticks out his finger
[1:17:42] and says, "You know, I'm enjoying this."
[1:17:45] Quit letting him enjoy your life.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; You can't make peace with Amalecch.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; Amalecch's got to be destroyed.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; Now, come on. I don't preach like this
[1:17:56] very often, but we need to deal with it
[1:17:58] tonight.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; Amalecch needs to be destroyed.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; He said, "When the Lord has given thee
[1:18:04] rest, thou shalt blot out the
[1:18:05] remembrance of Amalecch from under
[1:18:06] heaven." But the Brandham says this, you
[1:18:08] go find it on time for the quote. He
[1:18:09] said, "Any little thing that disagrees
[1:18:11] with the word is a baby Amalachite."
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; A lot of things marked out for
[1:18:18] destruction.
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; Any little thing that disagrees with the
[1:18:21] word is a baby Amalachite.
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; Remember, Saul failed to get rid of the
[1:18:25] Amalachites. [snorts]
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; And the kingdom was taken away from him
[1:18:28] over it.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; He he he didn't deal with it. And he
[1:18:33] said, "I I've done what the Lord
[1:18:34] commanded." And Samuel said, "What's
[1:18:36] this bleeding of sheep that I hear?
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; How come I hear the things that you
[1:18:41] spared?
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; Why do I see the evidence of it in your
[1:18:44] life?" And Saul failed to do it and the
[1:18:47] kingdom was taken away from him. But the
[1:18:49] reason DAVID HAD TO DEAL WITH IT IS
[1:18:51] BECAUSE SAUL DIDN'T. So I'll say this,
[1:18:53] IF FOR NO OTHER REASON, LET'S DEAL WITH
[1:18:56] IT NOW SO OUR CHILDREN DON'T HAVE TO
[1:18:58] DEAL WITH IT LATER.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; THOSE THINGS THAT ARE MARKED OUT FOR
[1:19:01] DESTRUCTION, LET'S GET RID of them.
[1:19:04] Yeah.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; David encouraged himself in the Lord to
[1:19:09] take back what belonged to him and to
[1:19:10] destroy an enemy already marked with
[1:19:12] destruction. We can be encouraged in
[1:19:15] 2026 to do the same thing. Oh my. THAT
[1:19:18] THOSE THINGS WHICH ARE MARKED OUT FOR
[1:19:19] DESTRUCTION, we would win that battle
[1:19:21] and we WOULD OVERCOME AND TAKE BACK WHAT
[1:19:23] the devil stole from us.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; Listen, brother Brown said, regardless
[1:19:27] of how little we are, how low WE ARE,
[1:19:29] HOW IMPURE WE ARE, HOW UNHOLY WE ARE,
[1:19:32] LISTEN to me. We we need to just cut off
[1:19:34] that legalistic spirit right now. You
[1:19:36] say, "Well, I'm not I'm too impure. I'm
[1:19:38] too unholy. I I can't take hold of THE
[1:19:40] PROMISES OF GOD." THAT'S WHEN YOU NEED
[1:19:42] TO TAKE HOLD of the promises OF GOD. SO,
[1:19:44] YOU WON'T BE IMPURE ANYMORE. YOU WON'T
[1:19:46] BE UNHOLY ANYMORE. IF YOU EVER NEEDED TO
[1:19:49] BELIEVE, IT'S AT THAT MOMENT WHEN YOU
[1:19:50] FELT THE WORST. That's right.
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; He said, "No matter HOW IMPURE WE ARE,
[1:19:55] HOW UNHOLY WE ARE, HOW SICK WE ARE, HOW
[1:19:57] AFFLICTED WE ARE, THE LAW OF GOD'S
[1:19:59] SPIRIT BY HIS WORD MAKES it obey him,
[1:20:01] forces the issue, and says, give it
[1:20:03] back."
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; Well, I wonder how MANY OF US COULD SAY,
[1:20:05] "GIVE IT BACK." If you've LOST YOUR JOY
[1:20:07] IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD, SATAN, I'M
[1:20:10] TAKING IT BACK FROM YOU. IF YOU'VE LOST
[1:20:11] YOUR ABILITY TO RAISE YOUR HAND AND
[1:20:13] WORSHIP, LISTEN TO ME. YOU SING SONGS IN
[1:20:15] THE HOUSE OF GOD THAT TELL YOU ABOUT THE
[1:20:17] WORD, AND WE'RE AFRAID TO RAISE OUR HAND
[1:20:19] IN WORSHIP. WE OUGHT TO TAKE OUR JOY
[1:20:20] BACK FROM THE ENEMY.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; REGARDLESS HOW LITTLE WE ARE. I DON'T
[1:20:26] CARE IF YOU'RE SITTING HERE TODAY, IF
[1:20:27] YOU'RE WATCHING ONLINE, HOWEVER YOU'RE
[1:20:29] HERE IN THIS SERVICE, WHY DON'T YOU GO
[1:20:30] GET IT BACK TODAY? Go force THE ISSUE.
[1:20:33] HE SAID, "OH, IF WE COULD JUST THINK OF
[1:20:34] THAT FOR A MINUTE, IT FORCES it
[1:20:36] regardless of conditions." No matter
[1:20:38] what the condition is, the law of God's
[1:20:40] word forces THE CONDITION TO COPE WITH
[1:20:42] HIS WORD. OH MY, THE HERMAN THUMBAM SAID
[1:20:45] THAT DEPRESSION WAS MARKED OUT FOR
[1:20:47] DESTRUCTION. THEN LET ME DESTROY
[1:20:48] DEPRESSION IN my life.
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; Take joy back from the enemy.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; It's just one thing, but there's many
[1:20:55] things.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; I used to love the word. Now I could
[1:21:01] care less whether I hear it. Take back
[1:21:02] your love for the word.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; Oh God.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; Take it back from CNN and Fox News.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; Take back your love from the for the
[1:21:14] word, from entertainment.
[1:21:16] Amen.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; Till I love to hear your word again.
[1:21:21] LORD, LET ME GET DESPERATE AND ENCOURAGE
[1:21:23] MYSELF IN THE LORD.
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:21:30] He said, "The promise is yours, but if
[1:21:31] you ever get it, you ain't going to get
[1:21:32] it easy. I'm going to tell you that.
[1:21:35] You're going to have to take it away
[1:21:36] from Satan.
[1:21:37] Satan captures your health. You got a
[1:21:39] right to go to Satan and say, "Give it
[1:21:41] back. Hand it over. I come in the name
[1:21:43] of the Lord, the possessor of heavens
[1:21:45] and earth. I'm his heir. Give it back.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, a lot of us can can think about
[1:21:50] this. You took my child. You got her
[1:21:51] mixed up with the wrong boy. You took my
[1:21:53] boy and mixed her up with the wrong
[1:21:54] girl. I claim them.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; That's right. I claim MY CHILDREN. I
[1:21:58] CLAIM MY BROTHER. I CLAIM my sister.
[1:21:59] Yes, Satan. YOU TOOK THEM FROM GOD'S
[1:22:01] HOUSE. COACH THEM OUT THERE, BUT I'M
[1:22:03] COMING AFTER THEM. I CLAIM THEM.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; WELL, HOW DO YOU KNOW? HE SAID, I'M AN
[1:22:07] HEIR OF ALL THINGS. AMEN. It's given to
[1:22:09] me. I'm an heir. I CAN CLAIM EVERYTHING
[1:22:10] that God promised me. There you are.
[1:22:13] It's mine. HOW DO YOU GET IT? SOMETHING
[1:22:14] YOU DONE? NO SIR. It's the unmmerited
[1:22:17] gift that God GAVE US AND IT'S OURS. It
[1:22:19] belongs to us.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; SATAN CANNOT HOLD IT IF YOU GO TO HIM IN
[1:22:23] the scriptural authoritative word with
[1:22:25] faith to say, "It is mine. Lay it down."
[1:22:28] Amen. Glory. I like that. He said,
[1:22:29] "Satan, YOU LAY IT DOWN. YOU TOOK IT
[1:22:31] FROM ME. YOU GIVE IT BACK BECAUSE I'M
[1:22:33] SERVING notice on you. I've got the
[1:22:35] notice written right HERE ON THE WORD.
[1:22:37] HEAVENS AND EARTH WILL PASS AWAY, but
[1:22:38] this notice shall not."
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. You need to keep your gun trained
[1:22:43] on that old devil.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; Some intruder come in your house. Some
[1:22:49] of y'all would shoot first and ask ask
[1:22:51] questions later, but
[1:22:54] man, I got a 20 gauge sitting at my
[1:22:57] door, right? Like I'm not
[1:23:01] if a guy comes and he starts to take
[1:23:03] something that belongs to me, I probably
[1:23:06] won't shoot him, but I'll make him think
[1:23:08] I'm going to.
[1:23:13] Well, it got quiet cuz the pastor's
[1:23:15] advocating violence.
[1:23:18] If you had some somebody come on your
[1:23:20] property, break in your house, and steal
[1:23:21] something worth 10 cents, you'd be mad
[1:23:23] as get out.
[1:23:27] You'd be so upset he took somewhere 10
[1:23:30] cents from your property. You do
[1:23:32] something about it.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; HOW MANY TIMES DOES THE DEVIL COME IN,
[1:23:37] STEAL JOY OUT OF YOUR HEART, STEAL
[1:23:39] THINGS AWAY FROM YOUR MIND, AND YOU JUST
[1:23:40] SIT THERE AND SAY, "WELL, it's just the
[1:23:41] way it has to be."
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; No, it isn't.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE LIVING YOU'RE NOT LIVING IN A
[1:23:45] LAWLESS SOCIETY. YOU'RE NOT LIVING IN A
[1:23:47] PLACE WHERE THERE'S NO BOUNDARIES.
[1:23:48] YOU'RE LIVING UNDER THE THE AUTHORITY OF
[1:23:50] THE WORD OF GOD. GO BACK AND TAKE WHAT
[1:23:52] GOD HAS WAS GIVEN YOU. Take your rights
[1:23:56] in the Lord. KEEP THAT GUN TRAINED RIGHT
[1:23:58] ON THE ENEMY.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; A lot of times we, well, he didn't drop
[1:24:03] it when I told him to, so I want to give
[1:24:05] up. No, keep your gun trained on him.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; Shoot him if you have to.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; Make him real uncomfortable.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; He said, I can have what I said. He said
[1:24:19] that gets him started. He said, don't
[1:24:22] get him started. gets him running. Lay
[1:24:24] it down cuz I have come with scriptural
[1:24:26] authority. I am a believer. I believe
[1:24:29] the lights have flashed on the German
[1:24:31] thumb. I'mum a vindicated prophet in our
[1:24:32] day has said, "Go take it back." I
[1:24:35] believe we ought to agree with that
[1:24:36] today.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; There's a couple of ways we gain courage
[1:24:39] before I close tonight. We gain courage
[1:24:41] through the preaching of the word.
[1:24:42] Deuteronomy chapter 20 and verse one
[1:24:45] says, "When thou goest out to battle
[1:24:46] against thine enemies, and see horses
[1:24:47] and chariots, and a people more than
[1:24:49] thou, be not afraid of them, for the
[1:24:51] Lord thy God IS WITH THEE, WHICH BROUGHT
[1:24:53] THEE UP out of the land of Egypt. And it
[1:24:55] shall BE WHEN YOU COME NIGH TO THE
[1:24:57] BATTLE." SO RIGHT BEFORE the battle
[1:24:58] starts,
[1:25:00] oh my. He said, "LET THAT THE PRIESTS
[1:25:03] SHALL APPROACH AND SPEAK TO THE PEOPLE
[1:25:06] AND SHALL SAY UNTO THEM HERE, O ISRAEL,
[1:25:10] YOU APPROACH THIS DAY UNTO BATTLE
[1:25:13] AGAINST YOUR ENEMIES." LISTEN, WE'RE NOT
[1:25:15] PROMISING THAT IT'S GOING TO BE EASY.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT PROMISING THAT THIS YEAR WILL
[1:25:19] BE any easier than last year. It might
[1:25:21] be harder,
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; BUT I KNOW THIS. YOU HAVE A GREAT GOD.
[1:25:26] YOU HAVE A GOD THAT IF YOU'LL SURRENDER
[1:25:28] TO HIM AND GIVE INTO HIM, YOU CAN WIN
[1:25:30] EVERY BATTLE.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HEY, look at this. He said
[1:25:35] he he said the PRIEST SHOULD ENCOURAGE
[1:25:36] THEM. LET NOT YOUR HEARTS FAINT. FEAR
[1:25:39] NOT. DO NOT TREMBLE, NEITHER BE YOU
[1:25:41] terrified because of them. For the Lord
[1:25:43] your God is he that goeth WITH YOU TO
[1:25:45] FIGHT FOR YOU AGAINST YOUR ENEMIES TO
[1:25:47] save you. Oh, I believe there's some
[1:25:49] preachers today that are doing that. I
[1:25:51] believe there's some pastors, some
[1:25:52] evangelists, SOME SOME GODLY MEN ALL
[1:25:54] OVER THE LAND THAT ARE that are coming
[1:25:56] BEFORE THE BATTLE AND TELLING YOU,
[1:25:58] "YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE IT. IT'S YOU'RE
[1:26:00] GOING TO BE ABLE TO OVERCOME. THE BATTLE
[1:26:01] MIGHT GET HOT AND HEAVY, BROTHER WEST,
[1:26:03] BUT YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE IT THROUGH IT."
[1:26:08] [snorts]
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; We gain courage through singing. Did you
[1:26:11] know that?
[1:26:14] That's why congregational singing means
[1:26:17] everybody sings. Amen.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; Testing one, two, as the brothers say.
[1:26:24] I'm not very good on my catchphrases.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; Congregational singing is called that
[1:26:31] for a reason.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; You may you say, "Well, I'm not a good
[1:26:33] singer." But the devil needs to hear
[1:26:35] your voice.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; And you need to hear your voice.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you need to hear yourself say,
[1:26:46] "I am not alone. Amen.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; God,
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; y'all bore with me tonight on that song.
[1:26:54] I just threw that on the kids. But you
[1:26:56] know what? I needed to hear myself say
[1:26:58] it.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you need to hear yourself say
[1:27:01] it. YOU MAY NOT BE MUCH OF A SINGER. I'M
[1:27:02] NOT MUCH OF A SINGER, BUT LET ME WORSHIP
[1:27:04] THE LORD, BROTHER STEWART. I AM NOT
[1:27:06] ALONE.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; We gain courage through that.
[1:27:12] 2 CHRONICLES 20:22 IT SAYS WHEN THEY
[1:27:14] BEGIN TO SING AND TO PRAISE THE LORD SET
[1:27:18] AMBUSHMENTS against the children of
[1:27:20] Ammon and Moab and Mount Seir which were
[1:27:22] coming against Judah and THEY WERE
[1:27:23] SMITTEN. WHAT WAS IT? THEY BEGIN TO BE
[1:27:24] ENCOURAGED AND THE LORD BE TO FIGHT THE
[1:27:27] BATTLE.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; OH CHURCH, WE DON'T EVEN RECOGNIZE WHAT
[1:27:29] WORSHIP MIGHT BE DO MIGHT DO for us.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; Listen what Paul what brother Brandham
[1:27:34] says. He said you know singing gives
[1:27:35] courage. You know that don't you? The
[1:27:37] soldiers WHEN THEY'RE GOING TO BATTLE
[1:27:38] YOU KNOW WHAT THEY DO? THEY PLAY MUSIC
[1:27:40] AND SING AND things to give them
[1:27:42] courage. AND WHEN WE'RE GOING TO BATTLE,
[1:27:43] WE SING. IT GIVES US COURAGE TO GO ON. I
[1:27:46] TELL YOU WHAT YOU OUGHT TO DO IN THE NEW
[1:27:47] YEAR. YOU OUGHT TO GET READY FOR THE
[1:27:49] BATTLE BY SINGING TO THE LORD. SING OUT
[1:27:51] A NEW song to the Lord. SING A SONG THAT
[1:27:54] THAT THAT LETS HIM KNOW that he's
[1:27:56] worthy. Amen. HALLELUJAH. SING A SONG
[1:28:00] THAT'LL ENCOURAGE YOU IN THE LORD.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; Encourage the people. Singing gives
[1:28:05] courage. And when we're going to battle,
[1:28:06] we sing. It gives us courage. Go on.
[1:28:08] musicians, go ahead and come. We're
[1:28:10] going to put the word in action tonight.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Listen, we're not limited. I
[1:28:16] I love when when Brother Joel's here,
[1:28:18] you know, he sings for us a lot. We're
[1:28:21] going to sing tonight.
[1:28:23] We love Brother Joel, don't we? I really
[1:28:25] miss him when he's gone. But let's sing
[1:28:27] tonight. LET'S ENCOURAGE OURSELVES. YOU
[1:28:30] CAN'T ALWAYS RELY ON A SONG LEADER. YOU
[1:28:32] CAN'T ALWAYS RELY ON SOME EVANGELIST
[1:28:33] SOMEWHERE. YOU GOT TO ENCOURAGE YOURSELF
[1:28:35] IN THE LORD. AMEN.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THAT'S WHY EPHESIANS 5:19,
[1:28:39] "SPEAK TO YOURSELVES IN PSALMS AND HYMNS
[1:28:42] AND SPIRITUAL SONGS, SINGING AND MAKING
[1:28:44] MELODY in your heart to the Lord."
[1:28:46] Colossians 3:16, "Let the word of Christ
[1:28:48] dwell in you richly in all wisdom,
[1:28:50] teaching and admonishing one another."
[1:28:52] How do you do it? In psalms and hymns
[1:28:55] AND SPIRITUAL SONGS. DO YOU REALIZE WHEN
[1:28:57] YOU SING DURING CONGREGATIONAL SINGING,
[1:29:01] even if your voice is bad, but maybe
[1:29:04] your wife needed to hear you sing?
[1:29:07] Hallelujah.
[1:29:10] MAYBE YOUR MAYBE YOUR CHILDREN NEEDED to
[1:29:12] hear it. Maybe you needed to hear it.
[1:29:15] I'm not alone.
[1:29:18] I'm going to make it.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:29:25] Brother JT, I appreciate you being in
[1:29:26] the house of the Lord today. We just
[1:29:27] lost Sister Clelet this week, but we are
[1:29:29] not alone.
[1:29:31] She's in a better place than we are.
[1:29:33] It's time to encourage ourselves in the
[1:29:35] Lord. We got a little battle left. HER
[1:29:36] BATTLE'S OVER. WE GOT A LITTLE BIT OF
[1:29:38] TIME LEFT TO FIGHT. LET'S FIGHT IT WITH
[1:29:40] EVERYTHING WE'VE GOT.
[1:29:42] Let's fight the battle, church. 2026.
[1:29:46] ENCOURAGE YOURSELF FOR THE BATTLE. GET
[1:29:47] OUT THE LIGHT AND PERFECTION. PREACH THE
[1:29:49] WORD. Sing the word. Live the word.
[1:29:52] Encourage yourself in the Lord. Let's
[1:29:54] stand together. Hallelujah. Oh Lord, we
[1:29:58] come to you
[1:30:01] in worship.
[1:30:03] Oh, come on, church. No matter what the
[1:30:07] serend.

[1:30:11] do that? No matter what the situation,

[1:30:23] hand.

[1:30:41] him know about it. You may not be the

[1:30:44] emotional person, but just let him know.
[1:30:46] Let let let it be heard in your voice,
[1:30:49] in your words. Oh God, I long to worship
[1:30:52] you. Oh, I long [singing]

[1:31:13] tonight. Let's just worship him now. No

[1:31:20] hallelujah.

[1:32:04] Hallelujah.
[1:32:06] All my words fall short.
[1:32:10] Sing it now.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; Nothing new.
[1:32:17] How could [singing and music] I express?
[1:32:21] Are you grateful to him, church? Oh my
[1:32:24] gratitude. Encourage yourself in the
[1:32:26] Lord. Will it be? You say, "I don't
[1:32:28] know. I don't know what I'm going
[1:32:29] through." Encourage yourself in the
[1:32:30] Lord. Oh, thank you, Lord. [music]
[1:32:34] Oh, [singing]
[1:32:35] as I often do.
[1:32:39] All singing now, [singing and music] but

[1:32:50] Oh, yes, Lord. Oh, so I throw up my
[1:32:55] hands,
[1:32:56] praise you again and again. [music]

[1:33:10] Oh,

[1:33:40] I've got one response.
[1:33:43] Oh, I've got one response.
[1:33:47] I've got just one move. I've got
[1:33:50] [music and singing] just one mood. Oh,
[1:33:53] let those things slip away from you.
[1:33:55] those things that are marked out for
[1:33:56] destruction. As you worship the Lord,
[1:33:59] let the chains fall off of you tonight.
[1:34:01] You said, "That can't happen, BROTHER
[1:34:02] BEN. I KNOW IT CAN HAPPEN. I'VE SEEN it
[1:34:04] happen. It's happened to me." Oh, so
[1:34:07] I'll throw up my hand. Glory. Raise you

[1:40:42] DAVID'S standing there and the people
[1:40:45] are literally picking up rocks to stone
[1:40:48] him. They were sure talking about it.
[1:40:54] He was in the worst moment of his life.
[1:40:56] HE LOST HIS WIFE AND HIS CHILDREN. HE'D
[1:40:58] LOST EVERYTHING. HE HAD NO CLUE HOW TO
[1:41:00] GET THEM BACK. BUT HE INQUIRED OF THE
[1:41:02] LORD. AND THE LORD SAID, "GO AND TAKE
[1:41:04] IT." WE HAVE INQUIRED OF THE MESSAGE OF
[1:41:07] THE HOUR TONIGHT. AND A VINDICATED
[1:41:08] PROPHET SAID, "GO AND TAKE IT." AND WE
[1:41:11] SEE IT IN THE WORD. THEN WHY DON'T WE DO
[1:41:13] LIKE DAVID DID? HE MUST HAVE LOOKED LIKE
[1:41:14] A CRAZY MAN OUT THERE WHEN HE SAID, "I
[1:41:17] feel like praising praising HIM." OH,
[1:41:21] THEY'RE THROWING ROCKS AT ME, BUT I
[1:41:23] STILL FEEL LIKE PRAISING. I feel
[1:41:28] [music] Oh, yes. I want to praise him in
[1:41:33] the morning.
[1:41:35] Oh, praise him all day long. Oh yes, I
[1:41:39] feel you like praising. Praising him.
[1:41:43] Why don't you praise him? Oh, sing it.
[1:41:46] Why don't you praise the Lord?
[1:41:50] Oh, God bless you tonight. You're
[1:41:52] dismissed. If you want to go, you're
[1:41:54] welcome to stay and praise the Lord. Oh,
[1:41:56] why you have a chance? Glory. Oh yes.
[1:42:01] Praise him in the morning.
[1:42:04] Oh, praise him all day long. Oh, I feel
[1:42:09] glory like praising praising him.
[1:42:13] Hallelujah. Oh yes, I feel
[1:42:17] like praising praising him.
