[Music] [Applause] oh [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] jesus [Music] we thank you for the opportunity that we have to come and hear your word once again father changes where we need to be changed sometimes lord you put us in different situations sometimes a little bit difficult just to see how we'll react to help us to examine ourselves in order to see what we are what we're made of father you know what we are and we don't hear your elect but lord we need to know that father i pray that every one of us would recognize who we are and we are not a hotbed plant lord or somebody that can stand in spite of all the difficulties of this life that lord would you shine down on us you can make us to be a witness to the world father i thank you for all that you've done all that's been said and done already in the service i pray that you just move lord in this service today help us to forget about the surroundings lord and think about you you said we're two or three are together together i will be in there if you are here lord that there's nothing that you can't do thank you for that amen amen god bless you this morning turn with me to zachariah chapter 4 and verse 8. zechariah chapter 4 and verse 8. thank you for being patient with us we may do this for a couple of weeks but probably no more than that makes you appreciate what you have doesn't it i haven't seen though jt sit this close to the front in a long time yes we put the sausages at the front it wasn't intentional but at least it wasn't for me my children for the harvey might have done that we appreciate you coming this morning and being faithful to the house of lord and we're here to have a good time in the lord and to examine ourselves and just come up closer to him isn't that it's not always good to do but the david's on a little honeymoon trip with his wife this morning anniversary trip and so um we were getting the pews he was working on uh some folks getting the pews out and then pews were big and heavy the people that got him i don't think realize just how big and heavy they were so they come over and got half of them and there was two young men and i was kind of amused watching them load them up because they were supposed to load them up because we were giving it to them i stood there and watched them for a while and they they were getting tired and he paid the other young man to help him well they didn't show back up and we called them and the reason was because that other young man blocked his phone number he wasn't going to come back and help do that look at him heavy fuse so a few of you brothers would stay around younger brothers who can do that after church he's supposed to show up after the service today and get the rest of those if he doesn't we'll have to move them anyway so there's only eight left so surely between us we can do that today amen and we appreciate you know i appreciate the continuity that we've had over the years uh been able to have church in the same place and things and but change is not always a bad thing sometimes it's a good thing and so we appreciate that and brother andrew glover will be here wednesday night that's what he's telling me he's going to go ahead and be here so we're going to have church here at the fellowship hall with brother andrew on wednesday night so you come and bring your shouting shoes if you know anybody that could be touched by andrew's ministry and bible in common and i'm sure it will be a blessing zachariah chapter 4 and verse 8 it says moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying the hands of zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house his hands shall also finish it so he laid the foundation his hands shall also finish it and thou shalt know that the lord of hosts has sent me unto you for who hath despised the day of small things for they shall rejoice and shall see the plummet in the hand of zerubbabel with those seven they are the eyes of the lord which run to and fro through the whole earth i pray the lord with that his blessing to the word this morning will be seated i want to talk to us this morning about multiplying by faith and grace multiplying by faith and grace god's people have always been underestimated and the reason for that is because the enemy often fails to account for the fact that faith and grace are multiplying factors and i got to thinking about multiplication the other day which is a lot for me because i didn't have very much schooling and so i got to thinking about it though and as i began to think about it i began to look at the parts of it and i asked my kids because they knew better than i did about what multiplication was and what the i have a hidden helper here behind the screen but what the parts of multiplication were and they told me that there are factors i believe is what they said and then they said that there is a product and so the factor is the first factor is our efforts now but random says that god doesn't do anything apart from man god doesn't do anything apart from man what that means is that jp uses us that's right god's going to do anything he does it through you and you're never so young or so old or so weak or so uh so sick or whatever it is that you're going through in your life you're never so a troubled whatever it might be that he can't use you yeah right he uses even your weaknesses becomes strengths right and i've seen many times that a person maybe would be used by god in a certain measure and then something bad happen to them they go through a really hard time in their life but all of a sudden god begins to use them that much more instead of less why is that because god blesses those efforts that much more he's able to multiply that effort so that's the first factor that goes in and then faith and grace are there now without grace we couldn't even be called to make an effort right right we can't even abraham didn't know who god was he had no idea that there was a one god he was making idols in the god shop he was there creating this pagan helping to perpetuate this pagan myth and god spoke to abraham and said i'm going to make a great nation out of you now that's pretty that's pretty difficult isn't it it's pretty difficult to believe that oh god how is god going to do that but abraham believes god why he was chosen by god god knew it before you ever asked him god knew that he was gonna listen to him and so god already knew that you would put forth the effort that's why you hear this morning that you have put towards an effort to come to the house of god god knew you would do that and because of that he then he provides faith for you and grace for you to multiply and when faith and grace come in it multiplies that effort that you have and those factors produce a product which is the manifestation of the word of the hour that you live in right faith and grace together bring about the manifested word of the album you can see that with mary mary doesn't know who she is one day gabriel spoke to her and said listen i found my women what was it it was it was god was speaking to her and and providing to her the grace the grace was in the message the fact that she heard it was grace the fact that she could understand it was grace are you with me this morning i know there's an echo it's hard to listen but but just bear with me this morning because it's grace doing here is grace that we can understand if he comes to us that's the grace of god and so the fact that that the angel spoke to her was grace and then when she heard it she accepted it and what part did she have to do with it she said be it unto me so she did have a thought but it wasn't a part of producing a child but it was a part of receiving the word so her part was to receive the word and said me and and to me and she said be unto me according to thy word what happened that began to be multiplied in her life and she produced the word of the hour now there's something in science in military science called a force multiplier and force multiplication refers to a factor or a combination of factors against personnel or weapons the ability to accomplish greater feats than without so if you have a you add a weapon and it multiplies the force beyond what it what it should does that makes sense so if you had a highly trained navy seal you add him to a bunch of raw army recruits that navy seal is the force multiplier just him being there is enough to make a difference beyond just one person right and so sometimes many times we are asked to do things beyond our abilities right god speaks to us and he asked us to to take on a project if you can put it like that beyond our abilities but he gives us a forced multiplier which is faith and grace in your life and he puts that into your life and then when you believe god it multiplies because when you put that seed down in that atmosphere it can't do anything else and you can't stop it from multiplying no matter how much you tried it once it's in that atmosphere it's got to multiply and so it has a different effectiveness than what it would have normally leviticus 26-8 speaks to us of you know some of god's man god's math is different from ours it says five of you so chasing a hundred if i did the math right that's 20 20 per person right five will chase a hundred he says but a hundred you should put ten thousand of white what happened it's a fall before you by foreign sword that's 100 per person so fighting you'll chase a hundred a hundred of you should put ten thousand of white they found that two oxen do not pour twice as much as one right they pull a hundred times as much they don't pull twice as much but it's a force multiplier if they're yoked together that they're falling different directions it'll take away but if they're born the same direction that's what we are jesus said my yoke is easy my burden is life we're yoked together and when god puts us together with faith with grace with each other what happens we do far more than what our number suggests be with me this morning far more so god asks you to do something and to believe something that's incredible now he asked the disciples much the same thing in john 6 and 5 jesus has been preaching to a whole bunch of people and he looked up his eyes and saw a great company coming to him and he said them to philip i love the way he does this he looks over it one of the deacons he says what are we going to give them to eat if i looked through the market and we had 5 000 people here this morning and said by the way we're having a potluck huh so you you can deal with it i'm going to mcdonald's right that would be my fault philip doesn't know he says but it says this he said to prove him for he himself knew what he would do you have to remember god always knows what he's going to do right but he asked philip to prove it and philip vasner and even said 200 penny worth of bread is not sufficient for them so philip uses a ridiculous number if any worth is one day's wages 200 days wages almost a year of work but it's not it's sufficient for them and we don't have nearly that much that every one of them would take a little and we wouldn't even buy enough for each one of them to have just a little bit one of his disciples and i love andrew if you go and study andrew in in the new testament he's always bringing people to jesus because andrew understood something that maybe the other disciples didn't that if you bring people to jesus jesus can do miraculous things and you at some point realize that all you have to do is get peter in the presence of jesus get the moral of the fish of those in the presence of jesus and andrew is constantly bringing people to jesus and so he doesn't realize that he uh he cannot um he cannot do this on his own he realizes that he has to do it with jesus now he says there's a lad here which have five barlinghoes and two small fishes but what are they among so many what are they among so many now he even doesn't know how god's going to do it but if you could get them in the presence of christ if we could only realize that girl went out and was naming the syrian and she was captured by them and she said oh if you can be in my country there's a prophet in my country if you can just be in the presence that i'm in if you can just partake of the word that i partake of i believe god could do something i don't know how but i believe he could do it and brother says this he said how could a man that could take five little pieces of fish and five biscuits and two pieces of fish and break them and feed five thousand not just wiggling fish he says but cooked fish not wiggling fish but cooked fish how'd he do it what kind of an atom did he turn loose what kind of power did he have not wiggling fish not i think you had to do something too but cooked one place but the red says seasoned fish it's got the lemon butter on it the herbs and spices whatever it is that you put on fish and so it's uh he doesn't even know uh he doesn't even he doesn't even leave it up to them how to uh how to season them how to cook them he just prepares it for him all right you've experienced power like that yeah so i've never seen anything like that yes we have he made you you he brought you out of what you were and prepared you and made you what you are today you don't live the way you knew because you just wanted to [Music] you look what you knew because god prepared you god made you that way now he said remember five thousand people have two fish took those little fellas and broke it off and handed it out broke off another piece and every time he said he'd break off another beast would be grown on he said cooked fish already cooked fried in crisp huh not just fried but pride and crisco i don't know why this is stuck but we'll get to it later isn't god good maybe god just wanted to speak directly to us today i just cooked but fighting crisco and so was prepared in the way that it wasn't just a fish dinner but it was the best fish dinner they ever had this was better than fred's sister why the master cooked it up [Music] every time you break it off another piece would go on already cooked and fried in disco ready to go he said what a person break off speaking of the bread raise up some weed don't cook it things like that the regular procedure he said but could bypass all of that just break off cooked bread and hand it out to them he says with brown crust on so he gives him cooked fish fried in crisco season he gives him bread making you hungry he gives him bread that's got a crust on him and you break it kind of snaps why he said take it and eat it what was it he was multitasking he was multiplying they brought it to him in faith here's five loaves two fishing and he multiplied it whatever efforts you take whether it's put some chairs now whether it's working and doing something for the for god if it's at home on your knees playing whatever effort you take it may seem small it may seem inconsequential but god multiplies the disciples would be out there testifying and they talk to one another and they begin to say when i saw him take those five biscuits and two fishes and break them i climbed up on the rock and looked over to see how he did it and i see that piece of fish in his hand he'd break it off and land over here and when he reached back again there would be another fish there not only a fish in the water but the fish are already raised and cooked and ready to go ready to eat he said when i saw him break that little loaf of bread and too laid out here he said but when he reached back again there was another loaf ready to be broken off again he said oh how he can grow bread amen oh how he can go away now what are we bad remember the wave sheep was weighing and then it come back on the day 50 days later he said i want to ask if there'd be a scientist he said here what kind of an atom did he turn loose at that time to make the regular wheat it was the same one he turned loose when he turned water into wine he's gone he does what he wants to very bad he does what he wants to and he's willing to do all things and give us exceedingly abundantly more than we could even think you believe that today if we will just let ourselves be turned loose in the faith in him he says that's where it lays his having faith in him to believe that he can to believe that he can for all things are possible how many things are possible all things are possible he said for all things are possible no matter what it is it's possible not only possible probable he said it will happen if you'll just believe it in luke 17 5 the apostles turned to jesus and said unto the lord increase our faith increase our faith but multiply it and the lord said if he had faith in the grain of a mustard seed i would multiply that to be able to say that this psychomine tree be thou plucked up by the root without planting in the sea and it should obey you you have faith as a grain of a mustard seed let's talk about that for a moment and going somewhere just a little bit later so hang with me but the bible says understand the angel of god he said sometimes when a blessing is pronounced upon you he may not be that he can he can't get to you right then he said it might not be just instant healing but as you believe your faith will make you whole he said some people have spontaneous faith great faith that deep that's a miracle some of them have faith about that deep it'll take a little while sun has mustard seed faith very little but just stay with it it'll bring you out he said it'll materialize it'll materialize all right because the mustard seed is pure it can't be mixed with anything so if it's pure faith it'll materialize it'll multiply right it's got to that's the one of the factors in multiplication it's got to multiply it's just it's it's what it does you can't make it anything else five times five is whatever it is 25. [Music] it can't be nothing else it's been multiplied are you now if you have mustard seed faith for healing it's got to be healing take place why because the faith is pure it's a seed but a jp is there a spirit it can't be nothing else it's got to happen but but see we a lot of times we doubt that mustard seed and stuff here he said but it's without that immediate the smallest amount of faith but if it's pure it'll produce something in the end it'll bring healing but it may take time he said some people have spontaneously some people have just mustard seed faith he said but just stay with it it'll bring you out it'll materialize now god made a promise to abraham that he would multiply his seed he would multiply his seed in genesis 17 2 he said i will make my covenant between me and thee and i will multiply thee exceedingly now israel over time if you look at the nation of israel they would believe god for a while they would be multiplied and they would turn against god and it seemed like they'd come down to almost nothing they would believe god for a while they would be multiplied and turned god down again and come down to almost now but the perceived the promise was still there they had a promise of multiplication he said i will multiply thee exceedingly jeremiah 30 and 2. now when i read my text we read from zerubbabel that that's when that's when the temple was going up laid the foundation and he's encouraging this governor to come back as one was in the line of the kings but he was just a governor because they were still under that dominion of a foreign government but he's encouraging him and he said you laid the foundation you're going to bring forth the headstone right and and talks about that we'll get to it after a while but before that the reason why he could be encouraging he could believe is because the word had said that they would be doing what they're doing right so god made a promise that israel would be multiplied they may receive would be multiplied and then in jeremiah 30 and 2 he said jeremiah said let's speak with the lord god of israel saying write thee all the words that i have spoken unto thee in the book why all of them put it in a book because they wanted the people to be able to read what god said to remind them of the promise for all the days come say lord that i will bring in the captivity of my people israel and judah saith the lord i would cause them to return to the land that i gave to their fathers and they shall possess it he said for i am with thee saith the lord to save thee i love this promise it's jeremiah 30 and 11 he said i am with you said the lord to save me though i make a full end of all nations now listen what he's saying though i make a full end of all nations whether i have scattered them now you don't hear people go around today saying uh talking about how that they're a certain nationality maybe the the ammonites are different ones the titles over there you don't hear people go around saying i'm a philistine i'm an ammonite but the jews are still here and he says all these nations without scattered me i'll make a full end of them you look at the nazi regime regime that was supposed to last for what a thousand years the third reich and it's completely destroyed it was gone in a few years why he said i'll make a full end of all nations whether i've scattered thee yet will i not make a full end of thee amen but i will correctly imagine i love this i will not leave thee altogether unpunished if you look at the jewish population over the years because he said you're multiplying he's talking about their population our multiply you see it exceedingly there's even a place in the scripture where it talks about the difference in judah and his teeth and then the seed of of another one of the other patriarchs that if you follow another line and it says that his seat was not multiplied like jesus because they have drums remember there was a promise to ishmael as well his seed would be multiplied but he said to the jews your feet will be multiplied if you look at that population over the years it goes up and then it drops off and goes up and it drops off it don't go like this but it goes up and down but in the end it's always more than it was and the longevity of the survival of it is amazing even to people who don't even believe in the gospel now if you look in at the population and i wish i could show that to you because i think the only graph if you look at this last hundred years or so it goes way up before the second world war and it goes down like this because there was the population drop off it wasn't 6 million jews died now before that time there was about there was about 18 million jews in the wrong six million of them one out of three you think about that one out of three jews were killed you think if anything would have ended that would have been him one out of three were killed and just now they say it depends on how you encounter if you can't only observe it jews they still haven't reached that number that 18 million number it's around 11 million today if you count those who are the children maybe not practicing but they have one jewish parent at least then just now has that number reached the pre-war number of 18 million jews but he said i'll multiply the exceedingly it doesn't mean it goes up to the straight line i hope you're following me faith and grace and multipliers but there's times when it dips down like this yeah there's time god there's times god's going to try you there's times god's going to let you go through things it doesn't mean you're not the seed of god it doesn't mean the blessing isn't still true it doesn't mean that you're not the seed of abraham the royal sea what does it mean it just means that god is working in your life so you took the graph of your life it's just like that population graph that goes up and then it comes down and it goes up and it comes down it's like the ocean and the end of it is the tides coming in it comes in a ways and it goes out then it comes a little farther and then it goes out don't you see that's what god's doing in your life because he's working he comes a little farther and we go through these seasons whether it's out we can go we'll never experience that again but you don't realize it's coming back stronger than it was because the promises of increase but it's not a promise that it would go up all the time but he says in jeremiah 30 17 he said for i will restore hell unto me now there's something that some of you that have been through it lately you can grab a hold of that promise i will restore health unto thee and i will heal me of thy womb saith the lord because they called me an outcast saying this is zion whom no man seeketh after verse 18 thus saith the lord behold i will bring again the captivity of jacob's gifts and have mercy on his blind places and the city should be building upon her own heat so may and i and the people building the city could look back at that so we're going to look back at that they could all look back and see there was a promise the city would be built again it was torn down it was just a heat but there was a promise it would come back out he said the palace shall remain after the manner thereof jeremiah 30 19 and out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice within the nightmare and i will multiply them he said i will multiply them and they shall not be a few they shall not be few he said i will also glorify them they shall not be small now who's he telling that do you tell that to a bunch of people who are going into captivity they're about to spend 70 years in complete and total bondage but god says i'm also proud of it there shall not be a few when you're down there you won't be down there you won't be completely destroyed there will be a few even if it's just daniel even if the steps of three hundred children there will be a few that hold on and of those that code there will be there will be some that will return to this man multiply the nation only few i will also glorify them they shall not be small their children also should be as a fourth time all that ought to be a promise we can grab hold of this morning their children also should be as the fourth time their congregation should be established before me and i will punish all that oppressed and then me and mine and ezra and all the different ones that are participating there of course the building of the temple and the building of the wall they can all look at that and say we have a promise but we have a promise today yes if we bring it down let's look at our congregation is that their congregation shall be established before me that's a promise we have yeah that's a promise if we're a church that god meant to be here there may be ebbs and flows but we have a promise your children shall be as important and that really spoke to my heart now let's go to zechariah 4 and 1. if you can turn there with me zechariah if you have your bibles this morning that's where i pour it on i know everything's all mixed up but sometimes you know you have to if you leave your living room the same way all of your life things you know it just kind of gets old but sometimes you got to shake things up to reset your mind a little bit so zechariah 4 1 says the angel that talked with me came again and awakened me as a man that was waking out of his sleep and this is the proceeding verses for the text that we were in and said unto me what see is that and i said i am hooked and behold a candlestick all of gold with a bowl upon the top of it and his seven lamps thereon and seven pipes to the seven lamps which are upon the top thereof two olive trees by it one upon the right side of the ball and the other one on the left side thereof so i answered the space of the angel that talked with me saying what are these my lord and the angel that talked to me answered and said everybody knows that but these be i said no my lord he answered and speaking of me saying this is the word of the law of the lord unto the sarah battle it's saying not my mind no my power but by my spirit saith the lord of hosts listen the christ says who art thou are great mountain before israel shall become a plain yes he said he had faith in the grain of the mustard seed you say to this mountain be thou removed i better take those off i'm going to lose those if if you had that kind of faith then here it says who are celebrating mountain before israel who seemed to be the most inconsequential leader that they'd ever had right because he's leading a band of jews may not even make it he's not even he's captive to some other nation he's following the of a human king about changing his mind any minute right he seems to be the most inconsequential leader they ever had but he said who art thou a great mountain because the river blood shall become a plain he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shouts notice crying grace grace unto it now we know that in the rapture sermon spoke of this message as the shout right the shout that was the first part of the rapture was the shout right the shout the voice of the trumpet now i'm not saying something didn't say we're going to read it in a minute so but look it just had to set in motion the shout had to happen to set motion becoming heads though and here but random uses the scripture and here he said he should bring forth the headstone they're up with shadows i want to tell you today that this has already taken place the shadow's already come we're not looking for a shout right the message is already here right so if the messenger is already here what comes next what's next now look here the headstone came though with shoutings crying out grace the message came declaring grace that brother brown says in the message of grace where he takes his scripture as his text he said we're all acquainted with the scripture that reads the bible we know that this was during the time of the preparation of the restoration of the temple and this rumble is a great prince amongst the people who had laid the foundation of the building he said now i want you to put on your spiritual thinking anointing jacket this morning as we think he's said this great prince had determined to rebuild the house of the lord and when he did he had laid the foundation stone he said and as we read on further we find out that god said zerupable has laid the foundation with his hands he shall also bring forth the heads though he said i want you to notice he never said he should bring towards the cornerstone he should bring forth the headstone and we know that the scripture says that jesus is the chief cornerstone and he's also the headstone do we believe that today jesus is the chief corner so he's also the headstone he said now we will think for a few minutes that the seventh church messenger was to restore the faith of the children back to the fathers in other words refilled the church again under the power of the spirit now look god made diplomas he would have arrived without spot or wrinkle he would multiply you everybody does follow wrinkle but now look what happened denomination come you saw a drop off a darkness come over the people but there was still a promise god was gonna restore and he takes a message that seems to be insignificant to the people he takes a message the theologians reject he takes a message that the world rejects he said well they rejected they've always rejected it that's no strange thing he takes a message that the world can't see nothing in and he takes that message and he used it to rebuild the church again under the power of the spirit he said not my power not by might but by my spirit said to the lord not by organization not by denomination but by the holy spirit do we really believe that yes do we really believe this enough i might not by power so it won't be by effort but it will be by the spirit it will be that multiplying factor that's what will make up the difference not by organization not by the nomination but by the holy spirit god will bring forth the church in the last day now he said zerubbabel the prince with joshua was the one that was to bring forth this headstock he had laid the foundation he had took the people back to the foundation entitled but now according to the prophecy that will come the headstone he said i want you to notice when the headstone comes the prince is going to cry out the message you see why the church went down and they went up in numbers but it didn't multiply in faith it didn't become the bride it was supposed to be why because there was no message of grace that message that multiplying factor had been lost but now it had to become a messenger with a message of grace crying grace grace because we have never made it if he kind works but to many people that's what the message cries works works and there is an effort like i said that's part of it but it's what is multiplied it's what god does it matters because i am fraternity different than in denominational preachers efforts in many ways and our efforts today we can measure our loyalty against denominational it may not measure up in some ways but that's not what he's looking at whatever effort we put forth when you're the best when you're the scene of god when you're the elect when there's faith and grace there he multiplies that so we come to the house of god without just an expectation of hearing a good sermon having fellowship with a few people and talking to a few people and things like that when we come to the house of god saying lord i believe whatever effort i put forth this morning maybe you're sick anymore maybe you didn't hardly have the money to drive the church but you said i'm going anyhow why what happened to god begin to put forth a multiplication of your efforts you come and healing begins to take place and salvation begins to take place in life because it was the works that they mentioned most it was by grace are we saved through faith let's go to nehemiah 4 and 1. now after the events of zechariah 4 after ezra after the temple has been built there had to become a time when the walls would be rebuilt and so under this the same message under this same now that the temple had been restored the church had been rebuilding to restore back to the faith of the father there had to come a time when the people works to build the walls and i believe that's the hour that we live in today we're we're building we're doing something we ought to always be building and we're just sitting there watching things crumble if you own a home you know that if you just leave it it's gonna fall apart that's right right but if you if you again if you keep it up you've got to constantly improve it there's no middle ground because if the nature of matter or things that are even our bodies is to decay it's just the nature of the world that we lived in everything decays everything falls apart and so you have to build now in nehemiah 401 it says but it came to pass when the symbol had heard and we built the wall so here they were building they come back and you know the story how that how does the king send him back and he comes into jerusalem with just a few people and he begins to rebuild the wall because the temple won't last without the walls without the structure being there to protect it he gets to rebuild that wall he was roth and the same with that of course when you begin to rebuild the wall there's going to be persecution there's going to be there's always going to be people say you can't do it because that's easy to say right it's easy to tell somebody you can't can't be done it's a lot harder to do that's why the the scientists did with the boundaries that we were talking about how that they said you couldn't well if you rolled a ball for more than 30 miles an hour fall off the end of the earth it proved that you can only go so fast most of us travel much faster than that we went in church this morning right and what was it because it's easy to say you can't be done it's a whole lot harder to say i'm going to do it we're going to do it so he took grand indignation and locked the juice and but now let me stop there because why does he mock because you can't stop it right so if you've got somebody mocking you and i don't know you may not but perhaps you feel sometimes the world is blocking you maybe somebody looks at your life and the way that you live and said that's crazy why do you even try why even trying to rebuild that life why even try maybe maybe you've been through some things people say why do you even try why not just eat drinks and be merry why even put forth the effort see why do they say that because they can't stop it if they can stop it if the enemy of faith could stop what's going on he wouldn't try to bless you he wouldn't kind of mock you he just stopped you right right the fact that he can't stop the fact he's mocking you means he can't stop you so take that for encouragement right and so verse two says he spake before his brethren in the army of samaria and said what do these people choose these people jews weak jews will they fortify themselves will they sacrifice will they make in the end of the day will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned and long as he criticizes four things he criticized their fortification he said will they will they fortify themselves they can't protect themselves what is he doing when he criticizes our fortification he's criticizing the word right because that was given to us for our fortification he criticized their worship he said will they glorify themselves will they sacrifice what those people think they're doing trying to worship after the walls have been torn down he criticized their expectations they said will they make at the end of the day it's too late to build the wall oh god we can just realize that's what i'm saying you're trying to tell people today right it doesn't matter like my father building a church why bother going and doing the things that you know why bother doing that because we're still here there's something for us to do but let's see we'll say why bother doing that what's the point what's the point do we criticize your expectation are you going to build them today look at the world that's falling apart around you but if god inspires you to build it it'll be built in a timely enough manner for it to be used he criticized his potential he said well they revived the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish and look at this place even the stones are burned they're knocked down there's not a warhammer left standing will they revive the stones but i want to tell you that's exactly what they did there's no record that i could find when they brought any new material to building the wall they didn't go and haul in new locks and they didn't have the ability to go ahead and do what did they do they built up what was there it was fallen it was dark it was it was smokey it was burnt but it was still gloss are you with me today it was still the city that got lowered on the bill this message hasn't come hasn't taken a trajectory like this we thought it would it would just go on up and keep increasing until 77 we'd all go home we didn't do that it went up and it seems like things happen but it is it seems like we're in a message with the people it's because we're human beings every generation comes that they have their own revival it goes up it comes back down a little goes up it comes back down a little doctrines come people come some leave the message don't do whatever that they do and so and the enemy comes by and says what are you even doing are you to rebuild this but it's still god's city stupid homes to him verse 3 says not to buy the am and i was buying he said even that which they build if the fox go up he shall even break down their wall this is just amazing to me nehemiah 4 6 he said don't don't leave the wall oh the wall was joined together he said him to the half there halfway up he said for the people had a mind to work verse 7 but it came to pass that when samuel led him to buy in the arabians and the ammonites and the asteroids heard that the walls of jerusalem were made up and that the preachers begin to be soft then they were very rough when the enemy gets very angry when you make up the breaches now think about this in your own life when you begin to get strong brother get in an area where you were weak the enemy likes to mock you over that because he's going to attack you with a tackle attacking that same place because he doesn't believe that you fortified it but you hold on to the word right because you say well i used to smoke death i don't smoke the more i used to drink i don't drink no more i used to run around do things that were wrong i don't do that anymore why the enemy will keep coming back against that breach now why were they angry because how could they steal kill and destroy the walls see these things are given to us for our protection you can look at it like a church you can look at it like a body of believers because this is given to us for protection and you see it when people begin to fall away it's like a coal is still a live corpse you take it out the other calls it will die much quicker why because it doesn't have the other goals to keep it alive and the church is not given to us for just to take our money that's not what the church has given for it's not given just to so we can promote some man to a great position but the church is our protection it's going to be a pastor sits like a watchman on a wall and watches it and tries to make sure the best you can that the word is being preached is pure and you sit there and you're able even though the enemy may come against you and come against you but you come you hear the word of god that fortifies you so no wonder the devil gets mad when the breaches begin to be stopped begins to be very angry and nehemiah 48 it says they conspired all of them together to come and to fight against jerusalem and to hinder it he said nevertheless we made our prayer into our god and set a watch against them day and night because of them now watch nehemiah and judah said now look here was samuel he was tobiah you expected them to be like that right they're the enemies of god you expect them to say things that are negative but judy got to listen to the news so much that he began to repeat what they had to say judah began to repeat it and the scripture says and judah said the strength of the bearers of burdens is decay we just can't do this anymore how many people have left the church because we just can't take it anymore our strength is decayed and there's it says much rubbish look at liberals you know it's all over the place but god was gonna use that rubbish to build along with it be careful what you look at as rubbish it might be building materials to god but they said there's much rubbish down there at the church so we're not able to build the wall it's easy to make excuses whenever things against jesus it says in our adversary said they shall not know neither see until we come to the midst amendment of slavery and cause the word disease so he says here judah was repeating what their adversaries had to say and it came to pass when the jews would stop by them came they said unto us ten times it says from all places when she were you shall return unto us they will be upon you so the jews there were jews there that were still in the land you remember not all of them left in the captivity there was something that was still in the land but they dwelt among the samaritans and the arabs and different ones that have different tribes didn't come in and the jews that were left begin to come in and when they come in they brought a negative report 10 tries 10 times they brought a negative report isn't that exactly what happened with joshua and caleb ken lim brought back a negative report but joshua and kevin said we're more than able right now nehemiah could have done two things he could have stopped the work and waited on them to attack or he could make preparations for the attack and keep the work going all right now the attack was coming but they said the best offense is a good defense so the best thing to do to make sure that the attack's not going to come or to make them think about it before they do it is to arm yourselves right so you're going to arm yourself you're going to pick up the word of god and you're going to harm yourself and you're going to you're going to use that but you're not going to quit working right right you're not going to quit living you're not going to quit testifying you're not going to quit being a christian and shining the light but you're going to harm yourself with the word of god so the people begin to kept building the walls as they kept building the wall he said therefore i said i am in the lower places behind the wall and all the higher places some of them that could be seen some of them that could not be seen he said i even set the people after their families with their source their spirits and their votes he didn't say now now if they come i'll fight for you what he said take him up take a sword take his spear see the preacher don't come on sunday morning to fight for you over the last part of it but he comes to hand you about hand you a sword hand you a spear to arm you with the word of god so that the work can keep going because as long as we're here the work needs to keep going as long as we're here there's still many missions to be to do as long as we're still here there'll still be neighbors to testify as long as we're still here we'll keep the church we'll keep remodeling we'll keep doing things why because we're here and we're supposed to work while we get ready in the fight the fact that we're still humans there's something for us to do god has preserved us for this time there's something for us to do nehemiah 4 14 says i looked and rose up and said of the nobles to the rulers to us to the people be not be afraid of them remember the lord or let's did you get nothing else out of the sermon today remember that he said remember the lord be not afraid remember the lord which is great and terrible you shouldn't fight for your brethren he never set fight for yourselves but he said fight for your brethren your sons and your daughters your wives and your houses all that god's across the men today that would be willing to stand at the wall and with one hand begin to keep the work going with the other hand hold the sword of the word of god and stand there and fight for their wives in their houses and fight for their sons and their daughters and fight for their brethren it's easy to talk about how to criticize the bones can you fight for him in my 4 15 that came to pass when our enemies heard that it was known unto us amen god had brought their counsel to not we returned all of us to the wall and everyone to his work and if you go down to chapter six it says to the wall verse 15 so the wall was finished in the 25th day of the month of little in 52 days 52 days they rebuilt the wall now that's without any tractors without any bulldozers it wasn't a small area they rebuilt the wall in 52 days no wonder if tobiah looked at it whether it was a massive 52 days you know what they found in 2007. in 2007 archaeologists there was a there's a tower called david's tower in jerusalem in the old city and it began to crumble and they so they went into current restoration work and doing that they had to dig it out and as it began to dig they found something they found a wall that was built in the time of nehemiah you go look it up they're called nehemiah's wall they found that wall it's still there a wall built in 52 days 2500 years later don't tell god that something can't last don't tell god that he's not big enough to make you laugh are you with me today maybe you just got shaved have you been saved for 40 years but don't tell god that he's not big enough to keep you going the wall is still there here you go i've got pictures of it on the internet the wall is still there they've still got the ability to go back and look at those stuff and you can see the wrong house that they built it out of built it out of just the rebels that was there but it's a war and it stood for 2500 years still found remnants of it why god inspired them to build that law god give you the inspiration to do it until it'll last how did they do it god did it nehemiah 6 and 16 it came to pass when all of our enemies hurt thereof all the heathen that were about to saw these things they were much cast down in their own eyes they were cast down in their own eyes for they perceived that this work was rock of our god there's a wall built in 52 days big enough to defend god's people for hundreds of years don't tell god he doesn't know what he's doing oh god help you today too many times i doubt to seek doubt you can't mix doubt and that must receive faith you've got to get rid of the doubt so that mustard seed faith can begin to grow and grow and grow as it multiplies spiritually as it begins to multiply through the grace of god in your life what happens spiritual multiplication when spiritual multiplication takes place you begin to look more like him because it won't be see the gene sees it's inside of you it's not a dog or a rabbit or even a human but it's god that is easy god's been a part of it it's a part of himself there's a gene seed inside you what's it going to make it's going to be more of god more of god more of god every cell that it feels there's gonna be more god don't you realize that's what he's doing today and when you when he gets done working in our lives sister fish we realize that it was him that dead oh now look grace and faith and multiplying together brother brown talked about how faith in jesus jesus five faith f-a-i-t-h-5 he said david took five stones he said he he picked up five stones fifty i-th he put him in his finger five fingers faith in christ he took those stones and defeated a giant but those that stoned become a forced multiplier why because grace and faith were multiplying together listen when they begin to be negative about what god was doing all the negativity did was speed up the work are you with me if it hadn't been for tobias but the reason why they did it in 52 days is because there were people who said it couldn't be done the reason why they did it as fast as they get is because there were people out there that wanted to kill there was an enemy out there that wanted to come in on them so they did it with one handed in 52 days are you it for now all the negativity that the world can bring on you today all it will do is speed up the work because god's people will be restored and have been restored back when it comes to the word they happen to be thrown after their headstone coming and we've had a message come that says grace amen grace into it i know it's a little different today that can be a positive or a negative it just depends on how you look at it i wonder if in our hearts we could just begin to talk to him and say lord help me to have that attitude that you can restore that you will restore help me to let that faith and grace be multiplied in my life you see negativity multiplies to all it takes is a mustard seed of faith mustard seed of faith and when that mustard seed is there we can grow to what god wants it to be let's just talk to him for a moment heavenly father we thank you for this church thank you for these people lord that have been so patient this morning with me and trying to get things set up the way we wanted god we we love you today and we're so thankful that we are not bound to our own potential lord in my own potential i'm just a clumsy overweight kind of guy i get to look at too much of that i get in trouble lord if i can just look at your problems there's something more than what i'm made of lord there's that seed that you put on the inside if i can just let your faith grace work in my life it's not what i can do but whatever effort i put forth lord are you multiplying god i know if i'm in your will and follow your word that you're multiplied you'll you'll produce it lord as mary and marc just stood at the tomb of lazarus they couldn't bring him alive nothing they could do but just wrote it in the stone but somebody had to roll with the stone maybe that'd be so in our lives today maybe if every effort that we put forth every action that we take may not do it lightly lord may we recognize that you'll multiply it you'll bless it be like the loaves and the fishes there may only be a few to start with but if you're in it you'll multiply it you'll produce something out of it thank you for that revelation today lord i pray that you make it real to each one
