[50:43] now I don't know how they think I'm a
[50:46] singer but
[50:48] at least we got somebody good on the
[50:49] piano
[50:52] um I tried to sing this morning
[50:56] and it was the first time I've ever sung
[50:58] acapella
[51:01] because I'm so old that they didn't know
[51:03] the song
[51:07] there came a sound from Heaven you know
[51:09] that song
[51:11] I guess it's C I don't know there came a
[51:16] sound from heaven
[51:19] like a rushing Mighty Wind
[51:23] it filled their heart
[51:26] their heart is singing
[51:28] and gave them peace Within
[51:32] the prophet gave
[51:35] promise the spirit will descend
[51:40] and from your inner being a river with
[51:47] no end sing with me for
[51:51] there is a river
[51:55] that flows from deep within
[52:01] and there is a fountain
[52:06] that frees the soul from sin
[52:12] and come to this water
[52:17] [Music]
[52:18] there is
[52:22] supply
[52:24] for there is the river
[52:29] that never
[52:32] shall run
[52:34] and this is most of us there was a
[52:39] thirsty
[52:42] who was drawing from a well
[52:47] her life was ruined and wasted
[52:51] her soul was bound bound forehead
[52:56] and then
[52:58] met my masters
[53:01] who told of her great sin
[53:06] and if you drink this water
[53:10] you'll never thirst
[53:15] for them there is a river
[53:21] that flows from deep within
[53:27] and there is a fountain
[53:32] that frees my soul from sin
[53:38] oh come to this water
[53:43] there is
[53:46] [Music]
[53:51] a river
[53:53] that never
[53:55] shall run
[53:59] [Music]
[54:07] that'll be all the music we're just
[54:09] thankful to be here
[54:10] I've been by here many times like many
[54:13] of you have been but
[54:16] today was the day to stop but I got on
[54:18] the wrong road and I went up you know
[54:20] the other way and I had to call for
[54:22] directions but
[54:24] um we're just glad to see all of you
[54:26] especially the newlyweds yeah
[54:28] congratulations sorry I couldn't be
[54:30] there
[54:31] you got a good one girl take care of him
[54:36] and uh I probably know most of you from
[54:39] years ago
[54:41] but we're here tonight to open the word
[54:43] and see what the Lord has for us so uh
[54:46] we're going to try to find our way
[54:48] through here let's look at some uh Psalm
[54:51] 143 to start with
[54:54] and um
[54:57] let's see here Psalm 143 verse
[55:00] eight if you'd like to stand in honor of
[55:02] the word that'd be good we've got three
[55:04] different places we're going to read
[55:05] from
[55:06] Psalm 143 to verse 8 causes me to hear
[55:09] thy loving kindness in the morning
[55:12] for indeed do I trust cause me to know
[55:15] the way wherein I should walk for I lift
[55:18] up my soul unto thee Deliver Me O Lord
[55:20] from mine enemies I flee into thee to
[55:23] hide me teach me to do thy will
[55:26] it's very important for thou art my God
[55:29] thy spirit is good lead me into the land
[55:32] of uprightness
[55:34] Quicken Me O Lord for thy name's sake
[55:36] for thy righteousness sake bring my soul
[55:39] out of trouble
[55:40] and of thy mercy cut off mine enemies
[55:43] and destroy all them that afflict my
[55:45] soul for I am thy servant
[55:48] and then a few pages over to the right
[55:50] proverbs 14.
[55:53] let's see here proverbs 14.
[55:56] and if you didn't bring your Bible shame
[55:58] on you
[56:00] Proverbs 14 and verse 12 there is a way
[56:03] which seems right to a man
[56:05] but the end of their they're over the
[56:07] ways of death
[56:09] so you might have a great idea and a
[56:11] great goal and
[56:13] but you better consult God oh yeah and
[56:17] then on over farther in the Book of
[56:19] Jonah
[56:21] and uh we'll find it here in a minute
[56:24] and Jonah in chapter one
[56:27] we see where it says now the word of the
[56:29] Lord came unto Jonah you know the
[56:32] prophet the son of Amite saying
[56:37] arise go to Nineveh that great City and
[56:40] cry against it for their wickedness has
[56:42] come up before me
[56:45] amen
[56:46] God bless you may be seated
[56:50] now I uh
[56:53] I carry this level for a reason
[56:56] that's for me to stay level not go off
[56:59] you know drifting up left or right yeah
[57:02] and you young preachers remember that
[57:05] uh it's also for you to have a visual
[57:09] because young people have to see things
[57:10] they can't just hear they got to see
[57:12] also
[57:13] but now it's got a secondary purpose
[57:19] some of you stayed up late too too late
[57:20] last night you didn't have any coffee
[57:22] today at lunch so if I see anybody
[57:24] drifted off
[57:31] did it
[57:32] it's been warned
[57:36] okay now Jonah
[57:38] our friend our brother prophet
[57:42] he was an Israelite okay Jewish prophet
[57:46] and he lived in a little town of called
[57:48] Geth Hepper just north of Nazareth up in
[57:52] Galilee it's the northern part of Israel
[57:54] now if any of you ever been there of
[57:56] course I see somebody that have been
[57:57] there but if you've never been there
[57:59] then you need to go you need to get your
[58:02] hands and your eyes and your feet on the
[58:04] land of the Bible
[58:06] how many would like to see your pastor
[58:08] go
[58:10] well that's that's enough there to pay
[58:12] his way I'm sure
[58:17] so now Jonah was the first foreign
[58:20] missionary okay yeah that's true nobody
[58:23] had been a foreign missionary before
[58:24] that God gave him instructions and a
[58:27] missionary is an apostle so they're in
[58:29] Ephesians 4. remember first apostles and
[58:31] Prophets okay
[58:34] so a missionary Apostles one that's sent
[58:37] out and even our Prophet said it's the
[58:40] highest calling
[58:41] so if we're going to bother to say what
[58:42] he said let's say all that he said yeah
[58:44] not just the parts that you like because
[58:47] if we take this little boy over to the
[58:48] cafeteria he's not going to get the
[58:50] broccoli and the beef he's going to get
[58:52] the chocolate yeah
[58:54] I was a little boy one time you know
[58:56] you were too right a long time
[59:00] okay so it's the highest calling and um
[59:04] the prophet says over here in uh end
[59:06] time yeah the end time it's called the
[59:08] end time 1954. I believe every Christian
[59:11] is obligated now not so much that you
[59:13] have to go over to the old country and
[59:14] preach but if you can't go help send
[59:17] somebody that can go yeah
[59:19] yeah so it all works together
[59:22] he says here everybody should hear the
[59:24] gospel at least once
[59:26] I want to do my part there's something
[59:29] about missionary work that I just love
[59:31] it these are his words yeah and just to
[59:34] know that what you're doing you're doing
[59:36] God's will when you're giving to
[59:37] missions
[59:40] that's pretty simple formula isn't it
[59:42] sure
[59:44] now let me just interest intersect
[59:46] something here
[59:48] um there was a church it was still there
[59:50] but a church over in Oklahoma they
[59:52] 'll come to the message they were small
[59:54] about 30 or 40 people and they bought
[59:56] this little catholic church nice little
[59:58] red brick building you know about third
[59:59] the size of this here and so it started
[1:00:02] growing and so they needed to build and
[1:00:04] have a bigger church so they started
[1:00:06] shopping
[1:00:07] and they um uh they saw this one Baptist
[1:00:11] Church for sale so they go over to check
[1:00:13] it out
[1:00:14] and um uh I was a Baptist anybody else
[1:00:18] was a Baptist here
[1:00:20] well it's okay we're not going to
[1:00:22] condemn you
[1:00:25] so in the Baptist Church we had a little
[1:00:27] thing on the wall you know that said uh
[1:00:30] last Sunday we had 200 this Sunday we
[1:00:32] had 220 and they give the offering in
[1:00:34] the last year ago we had these many okay
[1:00:36] so they're going on a Tuesday and
[1:00:38] they're they're checking out this church
[1:00:40] see if they want to buy it and they see
[1:00:42] where that you know they had say 300
[1:00:43] people and they had a offering of six
[1:00:46] thousand dollars
[1:00:47] well that never happened any you know
[1:00:49] anybody we ever knew and so the brother
[1:00:51] asked the Baptist pastoral how in the
[1:00:53] world that happened well that was a
[1:00:55] missionary offering we do that twice a
[1:00:56] year but he said if you come here during
[1:00:59] service you'll find very few new cars in
[1:01:03] the parking lot
[1:01:04] if you go to our people's house you
[1:01:06] won't see a lot of stuff
[1:01:07] see we teach our people to live you know
[1:01:10] a little more humble
[1:01:12] so that when somebody does come by or
[1:01:14] they feel a need to help they can
[1:01:17] actually do it not just sit there I wish
[1:01:19] you know and so that's what brother
[1:01:21] Brandon's talking about when you're when
[1:01:23] you're given to missions you're in God's
[1:01:25] will yeah
[1:01:27] now the title I forgot my will or God's
[1:01:30] will
[1:01:31] something that you've got to face every
[1:01:32] morning when you get up I'm not going to
[1:01:34] go the way I want to make another
[1:01:36] thousand dollars or am I going to seek
[1:01:39] God's per you know personal will yeah
[1:01:41] and so
[1:01:43] you know Brethren preached about
[1:01:46] missions he was a missionary he went he
[1:01:48] did a lot of work over there so
[1:01:51] missionary work is not simply traveling
[1:01:54] to some hot place or it's sticky and
[1:01:56] bugs and they don't speak your language
[1:01:58] and your food and all that
[1:02:00] no it's not just that yeah although it
[1:02:02] is he's but you see missionary work is
[1:02:05] living for others right here yeah I'm
[1:02:09] all right living for others now when you
[1:02:11] see somebody in need you don't just say
[1:02:13] well God bless you
[1:02:15] no take him to lunch
[1:02:17] do you need tires some way we can help
[1:02:20] you the early church which that's a
[1:02:23] whole other study which we were into
[1:02:24] this morning but helping each other okay
[1:02:27] yes
[1:02:28] so everybody wants eternal life right
[1:02:30] nobody here would argue about that
[1:02:32] everybody wants to go to heaven yeah
[1:02:36] they just don't want to go today
[1:02:39] maybe tomorrow or you know next week
[1:02:42] but um
[1:02:44] because you know when you die it's it's
[1:02:47] Eternal separation from God if you're
[1:02:48] not ready yeah
[1:02:50] so
[1:02:51] um we do have a lot of things trying to
[1:02:54] say here tonight and how much time we
[1:02:56] got it's only quarter to four great take
[1:02:58] your time McDonald's closes at 10 right
[1:03:00] that's right okay so we're covering
[1:03:05] [Laughter]
[1:03:09] 1960 a day on Calvary he was one man the
[1:03:13] perfect man he gave his life he made an
[1:03:15] example for you now what must we do the
[1:03:18] first thing I want to say he said here
[1:03:19] Jesus never lived for himself his life
[1:03:22] was spent for others that's perfectly
[1:03:25] eternal life
[1:03:27] okay when you say you go to church and
[1:03:29] you're good that's fine when you live
[1:03:32] your life to yourself you don't have or
[1:03:35] you're not expressing eternal life
[1:03:37] eternal life is living for others it
[1:03:39] proved it when he was in the lamb as uh
[1:03:42] when he came as the Lamb of God he lived
[1:03:44] and had eternal life because he did not
[1:03:46] live for himself he lived for others and
[1:03:49] you receive eternal life by receiving
[1:03:50] that day on Calvary and you don't live
[1:03:52] for yourself no more you live for others
[1:03:55] so I was born in a missionary family
[1:03:59] now we're not going to get into that
[1:04:00] whole to our testimony but it's good
[1:04:04] that's another service
[1:04:06] but um I was born in a missionary family
[1:04:08] I I learned early on what it is to live
[1:04:11] for others do without because these
[1:04:13] people need and so as time progressed
[1:04:16] and here we are you know that's late in
[1:04:18] the day
[1:04:19] living for others is in fact where the
[1:04:22] satisfaction is and uh my focus now as I
[1:04:27] was explaining to the people this
[1:04:28] morning is uh the people in Venezuela
[1:04:32] now I don't know if you have seen the
[1:04:33] news or you you know read or anything
[1:04:35] but Venezuela is very very bad off
[1:04:39] they have more oil in the ground than
[1:04:42] Saudi Arabia has
[1:04:43] proven Reserves
[1:04:45] but they have not they have not kept the
[1:04:48] infrastructure up so they can't refine
[1:04:50] it they're bringing gasoline from Iran
[1:04:54] it's insane
[1:04:55] yeah so because why are that that way
[1:04:58] because they are they're geared to
[1:05:01] socialism
[1:05:02] socialism has never worked although
[1:05:04] their basis in book of Acts yeah helping
[1:05:07] others well they help themselves first
[1:05:09] you know but socialism has never worked
[1:05:12] anywhere and they hate hate hate Israel
[1:05:16] well you're going down yeah because the
[1:05:19] Bible says I will bless those and bless
[1:05:20] thee and I will curse those that curse
[1:05:22] me yeah real simple formula this isn't
[1:05:25] complicated
[1:05:26] I mean
[1:05:27] you understand right little boy
[1:05:30] and so because of that since 1999
[1:05:34] they've gone down down down well today
[1:05:37] uh their their money is completely
[1:05:40] worthless it's not even worth the dirt
[1:05:42] that it's you know it's four thousand
[1:05:44] percent inflation
[1:05:46] when our inflation goes up a half a
[1:05:48] percent everybody gets nervous yeah
[1:05:50] yeah so then they go to the dollar which
[1:05:52] they only get from
[1:05:53] drug money and it's at two thousand
[1:05:56] percent inflation so grocery some more
[1:06:00] everything's more everything's more and
[1:06:02] then when you go to check out the
[1:06:03] grocery store they had 17 percent
[1:06:07] well how can you live like that
[1:06:09] so a lot of people are doing okay
[1:06:11] because they're connected with the
[1:06:12] government they're connected with the
[1:06:13] military but we're helping those that
[1:06:16] don't have any way to help
[1:06:18] we're just trying to keep a roof over
[1:06:20] their head and help their car work and
[1:06:23] be sure they have groceries that's the
[1:06:25] missionary work that we're involved in
[1:06:26] currently and it's um
[1:06:29] it's very needed now just across the
[1:06:32] river in Colombia this first world
[1:06:34] country they're friends with Israel
[1:06:36] they're friends with the us but
[1:06:38] Venezuela is not
[1:06:41] and
[1:06:42] Venezuela is about three times the size
[1:06:44] of Texas
[1:06:46] and a lot of people left they used to
[1:06:49] have 30 million people that was their
[1:06:51] population
[1:06:52] seven million have left
[1:06:55] some got on a plane went to Spain to
[1:06:57] Uruguay to Paraguay to Chile to every
[1:07:00] place
[1:07:01] some didn't have money to fly so they
[1:07:03] start walking
[1:07:04] oh yeah
[1:07:06] now between
[1:07:07] between
[1:07:09] uh South America and Panama there's 60
[1:07:13] miles of mud and mountains and drug
[1:07:16] dealers and all kinds of bad situations
[1:07:18] people have died they're just just
[1:07:20] trying to walk out you know so it's you
[1:07:23] can't even imagine how horrible it is
[1:07:24] but anyway those are the people who are
[1:07:26] trying to help and um
[1:07:28] we're trying to also to
[1:07:30] print messages for them some of these
[1:07:33] people have never seen a book in five
[1:07:35] years yeah can you imagine yeah
[1:07:39] yeah and so we print the books in China
[1:07:40] they come to Columbia they come across
[1:07:42] country they come across the river and
[1:07:44] they're getting books and they're happy
[1:07:46] you know so all these things are going
[1:07:48] on and we're only sharing it with you so
[1:07:51] that you know what we're doing you know
[1:07:53] we're not sitting at the beach we're not
[1:07:55] sitting you know in the mountain cabin
[1:07:57] someplace okay back to our brother Jonah
[1:08:00] the First Missionary he had a command
[1:08:02] from God
[1:08:04] go preach to the enemy their wickedness
[1:08:06] has come up before me I can't stand it
[1:08:08] anymore go preach repentance you God
[1:08:11] uses men yes okay that's right simple
[1:08:14] but there's one problem
[1:08:17] Jonah was Jewish and the people in
[1:08:19] Nineveh were gentiles
[1:08:21] very serious segregation
[1:08:24] excuse me they still have segregation
[1:08:26] today
[1:08:27] now in our glorious country some of you
[1:08:29] are old enough to remember when we had
[1:08:31] you know such now the integration hasn't
[1:08:34] worked out too well
[1:08:35] brought a lot of problems but anyway
[1:08:37] they had segregation and so they were
[1:08:40] out of balance Nineveh was the capital
[1:08:42] of Assyria currently would be Northern
[1:08:44] Iraq
[1:08:45] uh very Wicked sinful people very cruel
[1:08:48] violent city of over 120 000 people and
[1:08:51] it was a very large city took three days
[1:08:53] to walk around it
[1:08:55] and these Assyrians were constantly
[1:08:57] tormenting and oppressing the Israelites
[1:09:01] just like today because the twins always
[1:09:05] there you see
[1:09:07] and so God is sending his Prophet right
[1:09:10] into the jaws of danger
[1:09:12] uh to face the enemy go cry against it
[1:09:15] it was time for repentance okay
[1:09:18] God always sends warning before judgment
[1:09:20] right he doesn't just blast it gives you
[1:09:23] a warning you know and um
[1:09:26] in uh in Israel when Jesus was there he
[1:09:29] was nice he went around preaching
[1:09:31] Healing The Sick and so forth but there
[1:09:34] was three towns that just couldn't get
[1:09:36] with the program
[1:09:43] you're familiar and he just blasted him
[1:09:47] okay life went on
[1:09:49] like nothing happened 60 years later
[1:09:53] the earthquake came
[1:09:55] and destroyed those places
[1:09:57] now since 1948 when they started
[1:10:00] rebuilding Israel they're they're
[1:10:02] rebuilding each Village everything's you
[1:10:04] know trying to get it back the way the
[1:10:05] Bible says but those three places are a
[1:10:07] pile of rocks because Jesus condemned
[1:10:11] them
[1:10:12] and over there they'll tell you the
[1:10:13] reason because Jesus condemned it you
[1:10:15] better believe the Bible you know
[1:10:18] okay so in our country uh we had a
[1:10:22] prophet and he traveled everywhere
[1:10:25] preached everywhere but the West Coast
[1:10:27] just couldn't get with the program they
[1:10:30] just rejected and so you know God's cup
[1:10:33] gets full
[1:10:35] blasted just like Capernaum you will
[1:10:38] sink
[1:10:40] time goes by people over there look I
[1:10:43] know I know people just like you people
[1:10:45] they're Believers over there
[1:10:47] there's probably 10 churches on the West
[1:10:49] Coast
[1:10:50] you'd think they would hear the same
[1:10:52] thing we hear
[1:10:53] I don't know
[1:10:55] anyway
[1:10:56] our Prophet said it'd be a not just a
[1:10:59] couple of you know yards or no three to
[1:11:02] four hundred miles wide 1200 miles long
[1:11:05] that's a pretty big chunk
[1:11:07] yeah and there's going to be no recovery
[1:11:09] FEMA or no president nobody can solve
[1:11:11] that it's going to be bad
[1:11:14] now why is it important to us over here
[1:11:15] in 2022 because First Corinthians 10 all
[1:11:19] these things happen to them for examples
[1:11:20] and they're written for our admonition
[1:11:22] that we might learn upon whom the ends
[1:11:25] of the world are come Paul had to know
[1:11:27] that the end of the world was going to
[1:11:28] be a ways off but he had to write it in
[1:11:30] a way that they would get serious we're
[1:11:32] the ones upon whom the ends of the world
[1:11:34] have come you see we're the end time
[1:11:35] generation and the end of the ages is at
[1:11:38] the door so the world is falling apart
[1:11:41] yeah
[1:11:42] Jesus said when these things begin to
[1:11:44] happen
[1:11:45] you don't get involved and try to you
[1:11:47] know join this and no look up
[1:11:50] it's finished right look up Redemption
[1:11:53] is drawing an eye
[1:11:54] so once again we have a message of
[1:11:56] warning before judgment and uh the
[1:11:59] message is real simple it's not
[1:12:00] complicated you don't have to read all
[1:12:02] the books you don't have to know the
[1:12:03] Bible it's real simple
[1:12:06] repent or perish with the unbelievers
[1:12:08] you have a choice tonight
[1:12:11] so you can choose
[1:12:14] and um so we need a shaking we don't
[1:12:17] just need another cute sermon and let's
[1:12:19] go out and talk about the football game
[1:12:20] no we need a shaking shake off the
[1:12:23] shackles of sin the the attitude of no
[1:12:26] concern who cares we need to trimming a
[1:12:29] cutaway of the no interest and the
[1:12:32] idolatry
[1:12:34] it's everywhere yeah
[1:12:37] now some of you don't like to hear that
[1:12:38] but it's true so we're far beyond an
[1:12:40] aspirin or Alka-Seltzer and a little pat
[1:12:43] on the back you know you're going to be
[1:12:44] okay you're not going to be okay you're
[1:12:46] going to hell
[1:12:47] when you got to cut away that stuff see
[1:12:49] we need major surgery not another
[1:12:52] sermonette so we can't afford to keep
[1:12:55] playing Church Hebrews 13 8 wasn't just
[1:12:58] for William Branham it's for everybody
[1:12:59] okay
[1:13:03] so in John 4 20 if a man says I love God
[1:13:05] in first John 4 20. if I if a man says
[1:13:08] he loves God oh yeah
[1:13:10] but he hates his brother for whatever
[1:13:12] reason
[1:13:13] he's a liar for that he that loveth not
[1:13:17] his brother whom he can see how can he
[1:13:20] say he loves God whom he hasn't seen so
[1:13:22] however we treat each other believer to
[1:13:24] believer
[1:13:25] it doesn't matter what you what you know
[1:13:27] what color what they do no believer to
[1:13:30] believer however we treat each other
[1:13:31] that's how we treat God
[1:13:34] okay
[1:13:35] now you might never ask me back but
[1:13:36] we're going to give it one shot while
[1:13:38] we're here and
[1:13:40] um
[1:13:41] so God is watching our reaction to every
[1:13:43] test he will give you tests he will put
[1:13:45] you through the grinder but he's
[1:13:47] watching for reactions and you see uh he
[1:13:51] could solve everything before the sun
[1:13:53] goes down
[1:13:54] you probably won't because this test is
[1:13:57] going to go on he's going to take the
[1:13:58] people out of here and um but he's
[1:14:01] watching for our reactions to the test
[1:14:04] we're not going to have a president
[1:14:05] that's going to solve everything if
[1:14:07] everything was great in Washington we
[1:14:09] wouldn't want to leave here
[1:14:10] you know we have all that stuff so that
[1:14:13] we want to get out you see and so he's
[1:14:15] watching for our reaction okay back to
[1:14:17] Jonah he was God's man of the hour and
[1:14:20] that he had a clear-cut decision from
[1:14:21] God a commandment from God go cry
[1:14:24] against their sin and their corruption I
[1:14:26] know all about the segregation I know
[1:14:28] your fears I know your doubts go anyway
[1:14:32] so there was no there was no maybe no go
[1:14:35] come on okay Jonah 1 and verse 3. but oh
[1:14:41] we got a problem
[1:14:44] but but Jonah rose up to flee where
[1:14:48] tarshish
[1:14:49] we're going to show you in a minute
[1:14:50] where that's at from the presence of the
[1:14:53] Lord and he went down to Joppa found a
[1:14:55] ship going to tarshus so he paid the
[1:14:58] fair
[1:14:59] went down into it to go with them unto
[1:15:02] tarshish from the presence of the Lord
[1:15:04] second time in case you missed it the
[1:15:05] first time
[1:15:07] bad boy sounds really bad right it's
[1:15:10] gonna pan out here after a while don't
[1:15:11] worry
[1:15:12] and so um he wasn't just anybody this is
[1:15:15] God's man of the hour God's Prophet
[1:15:17] God's mouthpiece you see and um he did
[1:15:21] not break relationship he's still God's
[1:15:23] man still God's Prophet but he broke
[1:15:25] Fellowship okay
[1:15:28] brother Branham himself said anointed
[1:15:30] prophets make wrong decisions
[1:15:33] they're humans
[1:15:36] brother Brandon was born a prophet now
[1:15:40] you might not like that but it's true
[1:15:42] but then you know he was in love with
[1:15:44] this girl and then the Mother-in-law got
[1:15:46] involved and all that and so he made a
[1:15:49] decision oh well I'm sorry well okay if
[1:15:52] you say so then I won't go and
[1:15:53] today the river in Louisville is one
[1:15:56] mile wide okay
[1:15:58] but because of this man's decision God
[1:16:01] sent judgment and at that time January
[1:16:04] of 37 the flood came from the North and
[1:16:08] the river was 200 miles wide
[1:16:11] that swept a lot of stuff away you never
[1:16:13] know how many people all because one
[1:16:15] man's decision
[1:16:17] be careful
[1:16:19] Okay so
[1:16:22] he goes he should have gone one way he
[1:16:24] went the other way and um
[1:16:27] he goes down to the to the coast and he
[1:16:30] finds the ship going to tarshas we're
[1:16:33] going to find out no matter where that's
[1:16:34] at but um he um
[1:16:37] he bought a ticket on this boat now
[1:16:40] these boats were all wood
[1:16:43] um they were probably some of them were
[1:16:44] 100
[1:16:45] feet long and They Carried 300 tons of
[1:16:48] grain
[1:16:49] from the Middle East to Rome and other
[1:16:52] places because that's where they raised
[1:16:54] the grain the people up there waiting
[1:16:55] for it so these Merchants were very
[1:16:57] careful to go when there was good
[1:16:58] weather they didn't have you know cell
[1:17:01] phones they couldn't find out the
[1:17:02] weather they knew certain terms certain
[1:17:04] times that it was good to go so anyway
[1:17:06] they take off because this is what it
[1:17:09] it's what they do so he they go and all
[1:17:12] of a sudden the storm comes up now they
[1:17:15] get serious I mean you read it all see
[1:17:17] I'm not going to read you the whole
[1:17:17] chapter you got to go home read it and
[1:17:19] so they start pitching out the grain
[1:17:21] they start pitching off the stuff they
[1:17:22] don't need because they don't sink the
[1:17:24] boat and they start praying to their
[1:17:25] gods nothing happens and Hey where's
[1:17:28] that tourist we took on here come up
[1:17:29] here and so he's down there asleep you
[1:17:32] know
[1:17:33] and um so he sees what's happening in
[1:17:36] his look guys I know exactly what the
[1:17:38] problem is if you'll throw me or reward
[1:17:40] problem solved
[1:17:42] yeah well that's easy enough we don't
[1:17:44] need you anyway
[1:17:45] now God is a God he knows the whole
[1:17:47] story see
[1:17:49] he knows where you're going to be
[1:17:50] tomorrow at 3 30. he knows all things
[1:17:52] and so he had this special face we're
[1:17:55] not arguing about what his name is but
[1:17:57] fish was swimming right alongside of the
[1:17:59] boat
[1:18:00] just waiting for lunch there's right
[1:18:02] along and all of a sudden here comes the
[1:18:04] prophet barely got wet went right into
[1:18:06] right into the fish okay and um
[1:18:10] but in the meantime while Jonah was on
[1:18:12] the boat he tried to act like nothing's
[1:18:14] wrong now he didn't have his Prophet
[1:18:16] suit on he didn't have his little label
[1:18:17] you know Elder so and so like people we
[1:18:19] know
[1:18:21] um he was just he was just a tourist you
[1:18:23] know so he's going along and he um
[1:18:27] let me turn this phone off I'm sorry it
[1:18:29] happens sometimes you know
[1:18:31] um he was he was just going along and
[1:18:34] um he wanted to to pretend like he was
[1:18:37] just nobody
[1:18:38] but uh just kind of like Peter back in
[1:18:40] the garden you know of uh Gethsemane
[1:18:43] he acted like nothing was going on snuck
[1:18:45] in there like you know
[1:18:48] yeah but he was out of place he knew he
[1:18:50] was wrong you know and so
[1:18:53] so here's Jonah just kind of I'm just a
[1:18:56] tourist
[1:18:57] they found out who he was and so he
[1:19:00] comes along there and tried to act like
[1:19:02] the like the rest of them but um so the
[1:19:05] Lord prepared the great fish swallowed
[1:19:07] Jonah because with John with with God
[1:19:09] there's no surprises okay it was a
[1:19:12] special fish and Jonah could live inside
[1:19:14] this special fish okay now when he gets
[1:19:18] in there
[1:19:20] now opening up you got a weak stomach
[1:19:22] but the point is when he got into the
[1:19:24] fish
[1:19:26] it's dark okay there's no lights in
[1:19:28] there
[1:19:29] so he can't see eyes don't work
[1:19:32] uh he had the miracle was that there was
[1:19:36] oxygen he could breathe
[1:19:38] you know he learned to keep his mouth
[1:19:40] shut real quick
[1:19:44] smell was bad enough
[1:19:47] so he's down there he got seaweed you
[1:19:49] know couldn't see symptoms everywhere
[1:19:52] seaweed and so forth so the next time
[1:19:55] you think you got problems
[1:19:57] whatever your little problem might be
[1:20:00] think of Jonah he had problems he was
[1:20:04] God's man why is he in this condition
[1:20:06] because he made a wrong decision okay
[1:20:09] and so he had plenty of time to reflect
[1:20:12] on the decisions of verse 3 away from
[1:20:15] the presence of the Lord
[1:20:17] so he closed his eyes he said this these
[1:20:20] symptoms are all lying vanities I will
[1:20:23] get out of this mess I don't know when
[1:20:25] God please hear me so he was very much
[1:20:28] alive he could touch he could taste
[1:20:31] couldn't see
[1:20:32] he could hear he could smell and God
[1:20:35] supplied oxygen and he got serious about
[1:20:38] praying now he didn't have a Bible he
[1:20:41] didn't have an iPad didn't have an
[1:20:42] iPhone
[1:20:43] only what he had stored
[1:20:46] he had read he knew what God's word said
[1:20:49] and he got serious about praying okay
[1:20:51] and um so here he was with some
[1:20:54] unforeseen circumstances
[1:20:56] and um we have people you probably know
[1:21:00] some of them well I thought it was gonna
[1:21:01] be different when I you know come to the
[1:21:02] Lord and join this nice Church all you
[1:21:04] nice people I thought it was going to be
[1:21:05] different than this yeah you know
[1:21:08] because according to my calculations and
[1:21:09] what I figured out we don't care what
[1:21:11] you figured out
[1:21:12] let's go back to see what the Y the word
[1:21:15] says you know and so like Solomon said
[1:21:18] you know it's all vanity so the symptoms
[1:21:20] are very real he had to ignore his
[1:21:22] present reality and focus his mind on
[1:21:25] the word of God that he had stored in
[1:21:27] his memory
[1:21:28] no computer no nothing and he got
[1:21:31] serious and so he didn't know how long
[1:21:33] it was going to be
[1:21:34] you know God didn't tell him okay you're
[1:21:36] gonna be here three days so he could
[1:21:37] have almost held his breath for three
[1:21:39] days but he didn't know how long okay
[1:21:43] so he got serious praying now the
[1:21:45] prophet says the devil's Tremble When
[1:21:46] the weakest of saints goes to their
[1:21:48] knees what a power and a privilege has
[1:21:50] been given to the Church of the Living
[1:21:53] God
[1:21:54] when you follow your knees in prayer
[1:21:56] even the Devils tremble to the weakest
[1:21:59] of them
[1:22:00] and the devil isn't deaf you don't need
[1:22:04] to scream he knows exactly what's going
[1:22:06] on he says here and the weakest
[1:22:08] Christian here tonight can defeat Satan
[1:22:11] anywhere any place any time under any
[1:22:14] condition with thus saith the Lord
[1:22:16] just believe it because God said so
[1:22:19] you got to take it for you you see yes
[1:22:23] so why was Jonah in this situation you
[1:22:27] see apparently
[1:22:28] we gotta put that word in there
[1:22:30] apparently he had shirked away he had
[1:22:33] evaded his duty he had apparently run
[1:22:36] from responsibility ran from the
[1:22:38] presence of the Lord ran from the will
[1:22:40] of God opted for his own will you know
[1:22:44] and only the fellowship was broken not
[1:22:46] the relationship
[1:22:47] so every one of us had to make a
[1:22:50] decision to be here we could be
[1:22:52] somewhere else could be a lot of places
[1:22:55] but you chose to come here and so Jonah
[1:22:59] made a choice he was willing to pay the
[1:23:00] price
[1:23:01] go his own way he just didn't have any
[1:23:04] idea how high the price was going to be
[1:23:07] you know he paid five dollars for his
[1:23:09] his little bed there but much higher
[1:23:12] price and um
[1:23:15] so if we're here in Hardy and so God
[1:23:17] tells you to go to uh St Louis
[1:23:21] well I think I'll go to Dallas instead
[1:23:24] opposite direction
[1:23:26] and that's what that was Nineveh was in
[1:23:28] One Direction and tarshus was over here
[1:23:31] and and besides that the the fish you
[1:23:36] know they they have you know pretty much
[1:23:38] one speed and so he's got this guy and
[1:23:41] got this profit in his belly he's at the
[1:23:44] bottom of the ocean he's resting okay
[1:23:46] and um
[1:23:48] so he probably thought well you know
[1:23:50] there's a lot of sinful people down in
[1:23:51] Tarsus I'll just go over there and
[1:23:52] preach God will bless the word no
[1:23:54] problem not so much opposition and God
[1:23:57] would have blessed him but um you know
[1:23:59] the prophet says over here in thirsting
[1:24:01] for life now these are important quotes
[1:24:03] because he is identifying things that we
[1:24:06] go through and this great Pillar of Fire
[1:24:08] the angel of God the logos that went out
[1:24:10] from God that led the children of Israel
[1:24:12] through the Wilderness when it came
[1:24:14] amongst the people it separated itself
[1:24:16] and great licks of fire began to come
[1:24:18] down on each one of them as the pillar
[1:24:20] of fire began to break up
[1:24:22] God dividing himself amongst his people
[1:24:25] okay that ought to tear the heart out of
[1:24:27] anybody God tearing himself apart that
[1:24:30] he might divide himself a little bit
[1:24:31] into each one of us
[1:24:33] he says now can you see why I'm standing
[1:24:35] for the unity of every church now that's
[1:24:38] not the question mark That's a comma
[1:24:40] there yeah yeah okay pay attention can
[1:24:42] you see why I'm standing for the unity
[1:24:44] of every church every Full Gospel Church
[1:24:47] every believer
[1:24:49] yeah we're standing for the unity of the
[1:24:51] Believers not all these churches I mean
[1:24:53] there's lots bigger churches probably
[1:24:55] prettier better whatever but this is
[1:24:58] where God wants you you know so
[1:25:01] we ought to be of one heart one mind one
[1:25:04] Accord no matter how much we differ in
[1:25:06] the scriptures and we do
[1:25:08] now I love brother Ben but I guarantee
[1:25:11] you if I live next door to him we'd find
[1:25:13] something to argue about
[1:25:17] he's a nice guy but you know I probably
[1:25:18] eat different I probably like different
[1:25:20] coffee whatever
[1:25:21] I like Dale but you know he's Dale I'm
[1:25:24] George
[1:25:27] we tried to live together
[1:25:30] um so he says we might differ in the
[1:25:32] scriptures or you know our favorite
[1:25:34] quotations
[1:25:35] um that might be one might see it this
[1:25:38] way that has nothing to do with it but
[1:25:40] in principle we have to stand one Great
[1:25:43] Mighty Army of God marching on because
[1:25:46] each one of you in your peculiarity
[1:25:50] now brother Branham had a seventh grade
[1:25:52] education he loved to read but I've
[1:25:55] spent over 50 years working with his
[1:25:57] words to put him into Spanish
[1:25:59] yeah I'm a translator and so when a new
[1:26:02] word shows up like that it's obvious
[1:26:04] each one of us in our peculiarity God
[1:26:07] has proved that he's ignoring your doc
[1:26:09] oh God's ignoring your Doctrine I
[1:26:11] thought that's what was important
[1:26:13] what can I have it right God is a he's
[1:26:16] ignoring your Doctrine because he gave
[1:26:18] you the Holy Ghost and the Bible said he
[1:26:19] gave the Holy Ghost to them that will
[1:26:21] bait him that's acts 5 32. now if I obey
[1:26:23] him in my peculiar way and you obey him
[1:26:26] in your your peculiar way he gave us
[1:26:28] both the Holy Ghost so we ought to be
[1:26:30] Christian Brethren and sisters enough to
[1:26:33] arm up together that's not single file
[1:26:35] people arm up together is like this make
[1:26:37] a sweep
[1:26:40] we have to be Christian brothers and
[1:26:41] sisters enough to arm up together and
[1:26:43] March on for one great purpose the
[1:26:44] gospel
[1:26:46] that's why it's encouraging to me to
[1:26:48] hear brother Ben talk about Egypt I talk
[1:26:51] about South America and other places
[1:26:53] we're trying to find that last eagle
[1:26:56] just like some of you you didn't know
[1:26:58] you was an eagle until you wow look here
[1:27:00] the word says and you came alive well
[1:27:03] there's people out there waiting to find
[1:27:04] out who they are
[1:27:06] so you see but unto us has been revealed
[1:27:08] the mysteries of the Kingdom you see
[1:27:10] okay
[1:27:12] God has a perfect plan
[1:27:14] and so God does not hold those people
[1:27:17] out there accountable over here at the
[1:27:18] Presbyterian Church Church of God all he
[1:27:21] doesn't hold them accountable for what
[1:27:23] you know you see
[1:27:25] he's trusted you with the secrets the
[1:27:28] fullness of the revelation
[1:27:30] so he has a perfect will and a
[1:27:32] permissive will
[1:27:33] remember that and you have a choice
[1:27:37] Jonah had a choice my will or God's will
[1:27:41] so the prophet says over here in 1965 we
[1:27:44] try to work on God's permissive will and
[1:27:46] he will permit it but also if we take
[1:27:49] his permissive will though it's not
[1:27:51] right he will make his permissive will
[1:27:53] work out together to glorify his perfect
[1:27:55] will
[1:27:56] so there's hope
[1:27:57] but there will be a price to pay
[1:28:00] another place he says we must submit
[1:28:02] ourselves to his will and to his word
[1:28:05] don't question it believe it don't try
[1:28:07] to find a way around it just take it the
[1:28:08] way it is so many wants to go around get
[1:28:11] some other way and when you do you find
[1:28:13] yourself going on you'll find God
[1:28:15] blessing you but you're working on his
[1:28:17] permissive will and not his perfect
[1:28:19] Divine will
[1:28:20] so people ask me all the time Brother
[1:28:22] George how could I know God's perfect
[1:28:24] will
[1:28:25] you know there's a young man here with a
[1:28:28] red shirt on what's God's perfect will
[1:28:30] is it that girl over there is it stay at
[1:28:32] home what should I do you know
[1:28:34] well that's a good question
[1:28:37] you got to find God's perfect will okay
[1:28:39] it's a real simple formula God's word
[1:28:42] God's spirit and God's will always run
[1:28:45] in parallel
[1:28:46] they never cross each other they're
[1:28:48] never one going one way no they always
[1:28:50] go the same direction in parallel they
[1:28:52] agree you see just like these musicians
[1:28:54] they have to play in the same key
[1:28:57] it doesn't work because you know uh one
[1:29:00] wants to be and F sharp and wants to be
[1:29:02] an A Minor it doesn't work
[1:29:04] got to be the same in harmony you see
[1:29:08] so some people have a portion of the
[1:29:10] word memorized to the very letter
[1:29:13] and they'll know when you left out of
[1:29:15] the OR at or whatever
[1:29:17] and they'll hammer on that yes sir yes
[1:29:20] sir and that's all they know yeah
[1:29:22] those are brother once he traveled
[1:29:24] someplace and and after the service
[1:29:26] somebody met him outside said you know
[1:29:28] you said such and such well he couldn't
[1:29:30] remember exactly what they're talking
[1:29:31] about so what did I say before that kind
[1:29:34] of get the bearings you know I don't
[1:29:36] know what did I say after
[1:29:38] I don't know
[1:29:39] well it's a good thing you heard the
[1:29:41] mistake because you've got nothing
[1:29:46] and so they've got the very you know
[1:29:48] things memorized to the letter but their
[1:29:50] wires are crossed and they display a
[1:29:52] contrary spirit
[1:29:54] that there's no harmony with the rest of
[1:29:56] the word
[1:29:56] bad fruit results are contrary to the
[1:30:00] word
[1:30:01] and so John in John chapter 4 Jesus told
[1:30:04] the woman at the well God is seeking
[1:30:06] those that will worship Him in spirit
[1:30:08] and in truth
[1:30:10] that's why we carry the level his spirit
[1:30:13] and in truth got to be level it can't be
[1:30:15] all Spirit you know tear the house down
[1:30:17] while the music's plan can't be all you
[1:30:20] know legal it's got to be balanced it's
[1:30:23] got to work together
[1:30:25] I don't see anybody sleeping yet
[1:30:28] I'm looking
[1:30:31] okay so they asked brother Branham the
[1:30:33] question how do you feel is the best way
[1:30:34] to find the Lord's will in some
[1:30:37] important matters well all of our
[1:30:38] matters are important right he says I'll
[1:30:41] tell you dear friend the best way to
[1:30:42] find the will of God in some important
[1:30:43] matters is prayer
[1:30:45] oh we already knew that I mean that's
[1:30:47] what Naaman thought oh me getting that
[1:30:50] water are you kidding you know he knew
[1:30:52] he had better water at home
[1:30:54] okay so prayer that's one
[1:30:56] here's the way I do it I take it before
[1:30:58] the Lord and it's always been my
[1:31:00] strength I wait upon the Lord see what
[1:31:01] he says and I just let myself be neutral
[1:31:04] but see when you want something it's
[1:31:07] very hard to be neutral
[1:31:09] when you want the fried chicken and
[1:31:12] they're closed hold it down
[1:31:14] you know
[1:31:17] so you got to pray you gotta be neutral
[1:31:20] okay where are we at and uh and don't
[1:31:22] take either side so if I was in your
[1:31:24] place and didn't have these visions of
[1:31:26] course you know he was a bit handicapped
[1:31:27] that way he knew him had a little better
[1:31:29] Advantage
[1:31:31] um I would suggest to the Lord and say
[1:31:33] Lord now you show me what's the decision
[1:31:34] to make and then the way you feel led
[1:31:36] then wait wait are you kidding
[1:31:40] hey we're 21st century Christians we
[1:31:42] don't wait
[1:31:44] planes are leaving every night we can go
[1:31:45] somewhere you know
[1:31:47] and so yeah wait
[1:31:50] yeah and then wait just a little bit and
[1:31:52] then wait a little bit longer oh and see
[1:31:54] which way the Lord leads and say now
[1:31:56] father you know in my heart it doesn't
[1:31:58] matter
[1:31:59] but I want to know what you want to do
[1:32:01] about it that's how you find God's
[1:32:04] perfect will for whatever matters are in
[1:32:06] your life okay
[1:32:08] so with Jonah
[1:32:10] um God did make his permissive will turn
[1:32:13] around to accomplish his perfect will
[1:32:16] the special fish delivered him on the
[1:32:18] shore and God reminded him once more
[1:32:21] now I'm sure if you've been around this
[1:32:24] message very long you've heard Brethren
[1:32:26] tell the story how that you know the
[1:32:27] people in Nineveh worship the god of the
[1:32:29] sea and so here comes the fish it sticks
[1:32:32] his tongue out and Prophet walks out and
[1:32:33] they believed
[1:32:35] well listen again
[1:32:36] he says I read that in a book
[1:32:39] Prophet didn't preach out of the word he
[1:32:41] read in the book sounded good made a
[1:32:43] good drama but the word says over here
[1:32:45] in chapter 3 verse 1
[1:32:48] says and the word of the Lord came again
[1:32:51] it came the word of the Lord came unto
[1:32:54] Jonah the second time saying arise go to
[1:32:58] Nineveh that great City and preach unto
[1:33:00] it the preaching that I bid Thee Well if
[1:33:02] he's there it wouldn't be saying that
[1:33:05] so Jonah's in the belly of the whale
[1:33:07] three days three nights he's
[1:33:10] completely covered in you know what
[1:33:14] now I'm sure that brother Dale could
[1:33:15] tell you stories about making these long
[1:33:17] trips and you know some of these little
[1:33:19] kids ate too much candy or something
[1:33:22] a lot of cleanup well here's Jonah he's
[1:33:26] completely covered in vomit
[1:33:28] and the whales had enough and
[1:33:33] he lands in the sand and he's rolling in
[1:33:35] the sand
[1:33:37] oh he's a total mess
[1:33:39] he's got to go down to Car Wash and get
[1:33:41] cleaned off you know
[1:33:43] and get some clean clothes and God says
[1:33:45] now get over there where I told you no
[1:33:47] more of this fooling around go where I
[1:33:49] told you
[1:33:51] and um and so um see he had a second
[1:33:55] chance you might not have a second
[1:33:57] chance God tells you to do something you
[1:34:00] don't dilly-dally around you don't vote
[1:34:01] on it just go and do it
[1:34:04] now a simple example
[1:34:07] was a long time ago
[1:34:09] uh 1955 they made the movie of The Ten
[1:34:12] Commandments I'm sure everybody's seen
[1:34:14] at least part of it it's a four-hour
[1:34:15] movie well some people at the Tabernacle
[1:34:18] in Jeffersonville snuck off and saw it
[1:34:19] and then they come back and they told
[1:34:21] the brother Branham hey you know it's a
[1:34:23] great movie you ought to go see it so he
[1:34:24] takes his wife it's him and his wife and
[1:34:26] his daughter Rebecca that I know of
[1:34:29] so they go down to New Albany it's a
[1:34:31] theater about size this church small
[1:34:32] theater you know they didn't have the
[1:34:34] big ones like they got today and so he's
[1:34:36] sitting there
[1:34:37] and um
[1:34:38] and they showed this movie well you know
[1:34:40] on the film The all of a sudden the
[1:34:42] pillar fire comes rolling onto the
[1:34:44] screen well they did such a good job he
[1:34:47] thought it was a real thing took his hat
[1:34:49] off oh just a movie okay so he sits down
[1:34:52] well
[1:34:53] so they see they sit through this whole
[1:34:56] movie and Rebecca would have been about
[1:34:58] nine years old at the time
[1:34:59] and so they're going home it's late
[1:35:02] she's crying she's very sensitive child
[1:35:05] and he says well honey what's the matter
[1:35:07] you know went to the movie yeah but Dad
[1:35:09] you know to her it was like a newsreel
[1:35:12] and she said now Moses you know he said
[1:35:15] all this on the Lord's Side come here so
[1:35:16] you know the words and so we're watching
[1:35:18] people coming here well she's watching
[1:35:19] these people sit over here
[1:35:21] kind of waiting for something and she
[1:35:23] said God's not fair and those people
[1:35:25] they were thinking about it they were
[1:35:26] trying
[1:35:27] but they didn't knew fast enough
[1:35:29] see and so he said well let this be a
[1:35:33] learning moment here when God tells you
[1:35:35] something you move you don't wait and
[1:35:39] see if everybody agrees and this and
[1:35:41] that no get with it so that's what what
[1:35:45] Moses here or what uh Jonah
[1:35:48] he uh he got a second chance you see so
[1:35:51] after he got cleaned up then uh he went
[1:35:54] and preached very powerful anointing
[1:35:57] chapter 3 verses 5 through 10 records
[1:35:59] the reaction to the preaching of the
[1:36:01] word it was one of the greatest if not
[1:36:04] the greatest Revival in recorded history
[1:36:06] the entire city of 120 000 turned to God
[1:36:10] and held back the Wrath they had a
[1:36:13] choice repent or perish with the
[1:36:15] unbeliever
[1:36:17] only got 47 pages left this week
[1:36:20] but guess what about 150 years later
[1:36:23] they entirely departed from the from the
[1:36:26] plan of God they forgot all about what
[1:36:28] happened back there 150 years ago and um
[1:36:31] they forgot about the Forgiveness of God
[1:36:32] and God allowed the Babylonians to come
[1:36:35] in in the year 621 BC and utterly
[1:36:38] destroy the city
[1:36:40] now they didn't have bulldozers that
[1:36:42] didn't have Dynamite I don't know what
[1:36:43] they did but they utterly destroyed the
[1:36:45] city okay so devastating was the
[1:36:48] destruction that their ruins weren't
[1:36:51] even discovered until a little over 100
[1:36:52] years ago
[1:36:54] oh here's where Nineveh was
[1:36:57] yeah we'll check it out 2500 years later
[1:37:00] and so such hatred to destroy Scofield
[1:37:03] even says such is the way of God light
[1:37:06] rejected brings destruction
[1:37:09] and that's what's happened to our
[1:37:10] country
[1:37:12] the prophet gave him a choice 1956. now
[1:37:14] you know this this year and it
[1:37:17] preached it everywhere yeah
[1:37:19] yeah okay things started turning
[1:37:21] everything looked good I mean people
[1:37:23] remember back in 57 59 beautiful cars
[1:37:26] everything was lovely
[1:37:28] okay the clock was turning
[1:37:30] and so we've lived long enough now to
[1:37:33] see the results of that decision back
[1:37:35] there it's coming down it's going down
[1:37:38] you see
[1:37:40] and so God always warns first
[1:37:43] so Jonah was in fact a very crucial part
[1:37:46] of a larger picture Okay so much so that
[1:37:50] it's repeated in the New Testament by
[1:37:52] our Lord in Matthew chapter 12. so when
[1:37:54] you don't fully understand something
[1:37:56] that's going on in this church or across
[1:37:58] town or wherever
[1:38:00] when you don't understand
[1:38:02] be careful
[1:38:03] the word says Be Still In other words
[1:38:09] I'm gone I gotta figure it out don't
[1:38:10] need your chicken brain you know ideas
[1:38:14] be careful whatever is happening could
[1:38:16] be part of a bigger picture that God's
[1:38:19] allowing to play out I'm sure in the
[1:38:22] time of Jonah whatever Believers there
[1:38:24] were well hey I thought God told you to
[1:38:26] go that way you know there must have
[1:38:28] been some some confusion back then
[1:38:30] you know and so when something is
[1:38:33] happening you don't understand just be
[1:38:36] careful
[1:38:38] because it could be part of a better
[1:38:40] bigger picture and God is allowing
[1:38:42] things to work out but he's watching
[1:38:44] your reactions you see be careful God
[1:38:48] has not called me he's not called
[1:38:50] anybody I know to straighten things out
[1:38:52] no he's in charge you see and he knows
[1:38:56] how to put things in order
[1:38:58] so it would seemed that God's man God's
[1:39:00] prophet of the age God's anointed
[1:39:03] messenger he would seem that he was
[1:39:04] backslidden that he stepped out of the
[1:39:06] will of God it would seemed that way
[1:39:08] because we as Mortals with our small
[1:39:10] brain you see
[1:39:13] um we're such small creatures we don't
[1:39:15] have all the facts we don't know all
[1:39:16] that was going on back then we just have
[1:39:18] the story here and God worked it around
[1:39:21] and it worked out but we would have well
[1:39:23] we would have condemned him he would
[1:39:24] have never we would never let him preach
[1:39:26] in our church you know yeah man look
[1:39:28] what you did over there
[1:39:30] and so we don't have all the facts and
[1:39:32] we make up these uh you know knee-jerk
[1:39:34] reactions when we have partial
[1:39:36] information
[1:39:37] so watch out be careful
[1:39:40] see and uh very few people of Any Given
[1:39:43] generation recognize the value of the
[1:39:46] message of the hour that they live in
[1:39:49] hindsight is much better than you know
[1:39:52] current side
[1:39:53] we have in the New Testament we have
[1:39:55] Simeon that lived near the temple in
[1:39:57] other words you live right next door
[1:39:59] and he was old and God said to him now
[1:40:01] looks at me I know your old son and um
[1:40:04] but you're not going to die until you
[1:40:05] see the consolation of Israel now we
[1:40:08] don't know what sign God showed him to
[1:40:10] look for but he said watch for this sign
[1:40:13] so every
[1:40:15] um every
[1:40:17] day that they had the dedication of
[1:40:18] babies maybe it was Thursday whatever it
[1:40:20] was he would go out and he'd look no
[1:40:22] sign go back to bed this went on for a
[1:40:24] long time but one day he's out there oh
[1:40:26] there's the sign whatever it was that
[1:40:28] God showed him and so he goes over to uh
[1:40:30] to Marion and Joseph so only Mary and
[1:40:33] Joseph and Simeon knew what was going on
[1:40:35] the rest of them had no idea and they
[1:40:38] weren't dressed different okay they all
[1:40:39] dressed pretty much the same
[1:40:41] he says can I hold the baby well sure
[1:40:44] and so he prayed to the Lord that thy
[1:40:47] servant depart in peace my eyes have
[1:40:50] seen the salvation of Israel he was
[1:40:52] holding a baby
[1:40:54] but God showed him
[1:40:56] okay it's gonna get
[1:40:59] a little tough here so put on your seat
[1:41:00] belts questions and answers 1957.
[1:41:04] this city which could be Hardy but in
[1:41:06] Jeffersonville this city at the day of
[1:41:08] judgment will answer great price someday
[1:41:10] for there have been hundreds and
[1:41:12] hundreds of outstanding healings done
[1:41:13] right here
[1:41:16] um signs and wonders the appearing of
[1:41:18] the Angel down at the river and so forth
[1:41:21] um and still people don't believe it why
[1:41:22] is it someday I'm going to leave here
[1:41:25] and that's clearbank 57. someday I'm
[1:41:27] going to leave here I'm 48 years old why
[1:41:31] didn't people recognize that picture why
[1:41:33] didn't they catch that right quick
[1:41:36] why didn't they catch these other things
[1:41:38] why don't they catch these prophecies
[1:41:40] and things
[1:41:41] he says you know they can't do it now
[1:41:43] but one day I'm going to leave this
[1:41:45] world and when I leave they will
[1:41:47] recognize it some of you young people
[1:41:49] will realize that after I'm gone
[1:41:52] this day this has been fulfilled
[1:41:57] another place 1964. what did the
[1:41:59] lutherans do after the death of Martin
[1:42:01] Luther
[1:42:02] good question
[1:42:04] they met Satan and made a denomination
[1:42:06] and died
[1:42:07] never done anything else after that it's
[1:42:10] just became a great mass of people
[1:42:12] two tapes you need to listen to as soon
[1:42:14] as you can the world falling apart and
[1:42:17] the
[1:42:18] the uh anyway there's two of them right
[1:42:20] there in April of 63 in Albuquerque New
[1:42:23] Mexico so in world falling apart he says
[1:42:26] you might not believe that but this is
[1:42:28] taped listen to it a few years from
[1:42:30] today if there is such
[1:42:32] then you'll know whether it's true or
[1:42:33] not one day when the evening lights are
[1:42:35] breaking it's too late then you'll say
[1:42:36] that man could have been right but it's
[1:42:38] too late then it's just exactly like
[1:42:40] Jesus said when he was here on Earth
[1:42:42] quote God sent you prophets down Through
[1:42:44] the Ages
[1:42:46] um and what did you do with each one God
[1:42:48] sent you the prophet you all put him in
[1:42:50] the grave in other words you killed him
[1:42:52] exactly and then in about another
[1:42:54] generation you woke up and you realized
[1:42:56] that was a prophet and then what did you
[1:42:58] do you garnished the tomb what did you
[1:43:00] do he made a tradition of his life
[1:43:04] all through history that's the way it's
[1:43:06] worked
[1:43:08] it says here and that's exactly what
[1:43:11] Israel had done Moses they made a
[1:43:13] tradition of his life
[1:43:15] and that's the way we do with Martin
[1:43:17] Luther John Wesley and other men
[1:43:20] huh I wonder who those other men could
[1:43:22] be
[1:43:25] says here we're always looking back
[1:43:28] making a tradition of their life
[1:43:29] garnishing the tomb and their messages
[1:43:31] for another day by the time you wake up
[1:43:34] that day is live by we're in another day
[1:43:35] the whole system has worked that way
[1:43:37] since the beginning man-made systems
[1:43:39] certainly so
[1:43:41] we got to get serious
[1:43:43] his brother Adam's life is going to be
[1:43:45] an exception to this rule it's always
[1:43:47] been this way I don't think so we're
[1:43:49] seeing people today making a tradition
[1:43:51] not a life-changing decision
[1:43:54] so when we don't understand something
[1:43:57] don't have all the facts
[1:44:00] yes Lord whatever you say
[1:44:02] be careful
[1:44:04] okay so Jonah was God's prophet
[1:44:07] he was human he looked for the easier
[1:44:10] way no pressure people to agree with him
[1:44:12] and um pat on the back and many times
[1:44:16] God will indicate to us his will yeah
[1:44:18] you need to do this or that but what do
[1:44:20] we do we go discuss with the relatives
[1:44:23] we take a vote or what do you think Mom
[1:44:25] and what do you think Grandma and all
[1:44:27] this stuff you see and so we look for
[1:44:30] the easy way like Jonah did
[1:44:32] brother Brown says you have to struggle
[1:44:34] to do the will of God sometimes so it's
[1:44:36] not always easy but it will produce the
[1:44:38] best results
[1:44:40] so today we have many Believers now we
[1:44:45] call them Believers I call them book
[1:44:46] carriers a lot of book carriers
[1:44:49] only God knows which ones are believers
[1:44:51] you know so we've got a lot of book club
[1:44:52] book carriers they're willfully their
[1:44:55] own will getting onto other boats
[1:44:58] that are not the ship of Zion they look
[1:45:02] like it but see Jonah he went 180
[1:45:05] degrees opposite
[1:45:06] we got people just two degrees off but
[1:45:09] two degrees off you're not gonna hit the
[1:45:10] target
[1:45:11] you're gonna miss it and it just gets
[1:45:13] wider and wider and when it's too late
[1:45:15] oh this this blue is not going the right
[1:45:17] direction after all you can't go across
[1:45:19] you got to come back where you started
[1:45:20] you see real simple
[1:45:22] okay so we can have a leading
[1:45:25] we can have a Doctrine
[1:45:27] uh we can have a promise right out of
[1:45:30] the pages of the Bible
[1:45:31] but if it's not in the proper season
[1:45:33] flowing in the economy in the plan of
[1:45:36] God for the hour
[1:45:38] now why do we say that hey there's all
[1:45:40] kinds of promises that you know there's
[1:45:42] the there's there's the ark that uh the
[1:45:44] Noah Bill we're not building Ark today
[1:45:45] that was for that time we're in another
[1:45:47] time got to know the season the day that
[1:45:51] you're living it and what God has for
[1:45:52] that time
[1:45:53] so if you're if you're not careful
[1:45:55] you'll be fighting the will of God
[1:45:57] you'll be fleeing from the presence of
[1:45:59] the Living God thinking and believing
[1:46:01] you're right yes but you'll be choosing
[1:46:04] your will not God's will having wrongly
[1:46:07] divided the word of Truth and there's a
[1:46:10] price to pay
[1:46:12] so how dark is it laodicea is very dark
[1:46:16] now it's hard to believe when we all got
[1:46:17] a cell phone we got you know nice fifty
[1:46:19] thousand dollar car all these nice
[1:46:20] things we have
[1:46:22] but it's dark spiritually
[1:46:24] now you might not have heard this before
[1:46:25] but I'll share it with you a long time
[1:46:27] ago 1959
[1:46:30] brother Brandon was preaching in the
[1:46:32] islands of the Caribbean
[1:46:34] and so he um
[1:46:36] was down there for several weeks and
[1:46:38] there were some Americans with him
[1:46:40] in the party and so one of the brothers
[1:46:42] years later said yeah I spent four hours
[1:46:44] with brother Brennan one day down there
[1:46:47] and he said we were talking about my
[1:46:49] family they were talking about a lot of
[1:46:50] things and she said so I asked him why
[1:46:53] do you say so much about 1977
[1:46:56] I see it doesn't seem very important now
[1:46:58] because it's way back but back then it
[1:47:00] was important and so brother Brandon
[1:47:02] said well the reason I said what I said
[1:47:04] about 1977 is because
[1:47:07] when I was looking through the stream of
[1:47:09] time so he's seeing numbers uh he said
[1:47:12] when he got 1977 it was so dark I didn't
[1:47:14] say any believer could live in such
[1:47:16] Darkness
[1:47:18] yeah that was 18 years before
[1:47:20] now we're over 40 years the other side
[1:47:22] so you figure out how dark it is
[1:47:26] okay let's see if we can cut some of
[1:47:27] this down
[1:47:28] so if we turn our back on the word okay
[1:47:30] maybe not openly but just by
[1:47:33] indifference just by a bad attitude
[1:47:36] look at look at the look at the John the
[1:47:38] Baptist's dad Ezekiel is that his name
[1:47:40] Zechariah yeah
[1:47:43] um
[1:47:43] he he had a a job in church maybe he was
[1:47:47] just maybe run the vacuum whatever he
[1:47:48] was doing and the angel appeared
[1:47:51] now
[1:47:52] he was there every day
[1:47:54] and and he was getting older and I sure
[1:47:56] wish I had a son so the angel of God
[1:47:58] Appears you're going to have a son he
[1:48:00] showed just a little bit of indifference
[1:48:02] not screaming and holler just a little
[1:48:05] bit of a bad attitude
[1:48:06] because of that you're not going to talk
[1:48:09] for nine months but you will have a son
[1:48:11] so we could we could we could turn our
[1:48:13] back on the word like that we'll be
[1:48:15] fleeing from the presence of God we'll
[1:48:17] be following an antichrist Spirit
[1:48:19] Antichrist Doctrine and soon you will be
[1:48:21] Anointed with arrogance
[1:48:23] with selfishness self-righteous
[1:48:26] respective persons none of that comes
[1:48:29] from God you're fooling yourself great
[1:48:31] you see so if we deviate just one degree
[1:48:34] from Center
[1:48:36] we won't hit the target you Hunters know
[1:48:37] that you see we don't have to be 180
[1:48:40] degrees off like like Jonah no
[1:48:42] so you know like Mary and Joseph
[1:48:43] remember them they were they'd been down
[1:48:46] to the temple they go down there every
[1:48:47] year so they go down Jesus about 12
[1:48:49] years old they could have been down
[1:48:50] their first bar mitz but we don't know
[1:48:51] they were Jewish okay and so they're
[1:48:54] down there and uh families there so
[1:48:56] they're getting ready to go home now
[1:48:57] back to Nazareth
[1:48:59] a few miles
[1:49:01] and so they get to the end of the first
[1:49:02] day and they're setting up camp and Mary
[1:49:05] says uh uh Joseph uh where's the boy
[1:49:08] well I don't know it was your day to
[1:49:10] watch him
[1:49:12] they walked off and left the promise of
[1:49:14] the day
[1:49:17] don't you know they had a ugly night
[1:49:19] that night
[1:49:20] because it's dark they can't go back now
[1:49:21] so the next day they go back and finally
[1:49:23] they find him but even then
[1:49:26] and the word is so full of details
[1:49:29] normally a Jewish mother would say oh
[1:49:31] you know Jesus have you had anything to
[1:49:33] eat here let me get you something you
[1:49:35] know
[1:49:36] it was all about me
[1:49:38] why did you do
[1:49:40] it made me look so bad you know
[1:49:43] yeah it's right there in the Bible so
[1:49:46] they went off in the Land of Make
[1:49:47] Believe thinking he was with them you
[1:49:49] know leaving behind the promise of God
[1:49:51] for the hour and many are doing the same
[1:49:53] thing today be careful recognize the day
[1:49:57] you live and what God has for you today
[1:49:59] and get with it
[1:50:01] okay
[1:50:02] so let's see we got a lot of things to
[1:50:05] say here but we better cut it back
[1:50:07] um so the thing is we need to look
[1:50:09] around be sensitive your surroundings be
[1:50:12] sure he's with you
[1:50:14] get in your get in your Bible
[1:50:16] if you read your Bible what is I think
[1:50:18] it's 12 minutes every day you'll read it
[1:50:20] through in in a year
[1:50:22] on your phone everybody's got a cell
[1:50:24] phone it's got the schedule right there
[1:50:25] read these chapters you can't go wrong I
[1:50:28] know some of it might be boring to you
[1:50:30] too bad read it anyway
[1:50:34] so our life our Doctrine our experience
[1:50:36] has to match God's word for the present
[1:50:39] hour not our imagination or some
[1:50:42] explanation
[1:50:43] we can't afford to live in a glare any
[1:50:46] longer we got to be sure that God is
[1:50:48] with us because we're headed someplace
[1:50:50] we're not just coming to church every
[1:50:51] Sunday no we're headed to the gate of
[1:50:53] the Resurrection we're headed someplace
[1:50:55] you see and so um we we have to have the
[1:50:59] the the attitude of the word well
[1:51:03] um
[1:51:04] brother Brown says here well that's the
[1:51:06] way it is today uh he says
[1:51:09] it's the way it is today with some
[1:51:10] people to call themselves Christians uh
[1:51:13] you say oh I belong to the church that's
[1:51:14] good
[1:51:15] yeah the reason there's so much trouble
[1:51:17] in the church the reason there's so much
[1:51:19] confusion in the church so much
[1:51:20] discontentment it's a sound like a place
[1:51:22] you ever was yeah confusion
[1:51:25] discontentment trouble it's not because
[1:51:29] Jesus is not there it's because Jesus
[1:51:31] can't gain access to the places he wants
[1:51:34] to go we have those little compartments
[1:51:36] and we say oh no no don't touch that
[1:51:39] come in that's far enough
[1:51:42] um I'll join the church otherwise let me
[1:51:44] run my own business Jesus wants to be
[1:51:47] supreme ruler of your being and the only
[1:51:49] way he can bless you is when he becomes
[1:51:51] your lord lord is rulership ownership
[1:51:54] who made you who was who has the right
[1:51:57] to every place in your heart the Creator
[1:51:59] another place he says and when Jesus
[1:52:01] comes in he wants to be welcomed but
[1:52:04] we've got those little secret doors
[1:52:06] little bitty doors in our heart that we
[1:52:08] don't want Jesus in there over on the
[1:52:10] right hand side now you might think he's
[1:52:12] dramatizing but let's just believe he
[1:52:14] knows what he's talking about on the
[1:52:16] right hand side of the human heart after
[1:52:17] Jesus gets in it's a little bitty door
[1:52:20] called Pride oh I'll receive it as
[1:52:22] Savior but don't tell me what I got to
[1:52:24] do and how I gotta dress and what I have
[1:52:25] to do I have to let my hair grow and
[1:52:28] stop smoking and go into the pool room
[1:52:30] and all this stuff don't worry he won't
[1:52:32] stay too long
[1:52:34] because you're Anointed with pride
[1:52:36] so if he's not Lord of all
[1:52:39] he's not an artist you see you have to
[1:52:42] yield to him and you you might need
[1:52:45] prayer you might need a lot of things
[1:52:47] God is able to change up to the
[1:52:50] uttermost
[1:52:51] look at Paul Paul was a bad boy he was
[1:52:55] following his prophet's words to the
[1:52:57] letter killing everybody didn't see it
[1:52:58] his way
[1:53:00] bad yeah
[1:53:02] you can go on uh what is it Christian
[1:53:04] book distributor someplace and get the
[1:53:06] film Paul Apostle of Jesus Christ
[1:53:10] very
[1:53:12] good with scripture
[1:53:13] and he he was bad but he was defending
[1:53:18] in a religious cause
[1:53:20] but then when God got a hold of him why
[1:53:23] did God let him do all that
[1:53:25] only God knows but you see I know people
[1:53:28] today they have run and run and run and
[1:53:30] run but thank God I called all of them
[1:53:32] God can solve anything yes you haven't
[1:53:36] gone too far God can solve your problem
[1:53:38] so may God bless you I hope some of this
[1:53:40] makes sense and
[1:53:43] um if we come back we'll
[1:53:44] go in another Direction but it's good to
[1:53:47] see you it's good to be with you in
[1:53:48] fellowship and we just pray that God
[1:53:51] will bless you
