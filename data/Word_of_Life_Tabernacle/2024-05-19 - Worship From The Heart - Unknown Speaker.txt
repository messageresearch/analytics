taking a little trip we're going fishing because you know how much my wife loves to fish and so we're doing that for our anniversary she actually does enjoy that when it's just us so we like to go do that we're going to do that for a few days and brother Joel will be with with you on Wednesday night brother Stewart will be preaching tonight I'm looking forward to hearing the word of the Lord tonight and and we also have our uh our youth uh and uh kind of focus on them as well us uh after the service so we're looking forward to all these things let's just set aside this time now for the word revelation 58 and when he had taken the book The Four beasts and four and 20 Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them Harps and golden vials full of odors which are the prayers of saints they sung a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book open the seals thereof thou was slain and Hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred and tongue and people and nation and H has made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign on the earth and I beheld and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the Beast and the elders and the number of them was 10,000 times 10,000 and thousands of thousands saying with a loud voice Worthy is the Lamb was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under the Earth and such as are in the sea and all that are in them heard I saying blessing and honor and glory and power be unto him that sth upon the throne and unto the lamb forever and ever and the four beasts said amen and the 4 and 20 Elders fell down and worshiped him that liveth forever and ever I pray the Lord would add his Blessing to the word you may be seated this morning I want to speak to you this morning on worship from the heart what is worship the dictionary my the dictionary that I use for words for Old Testament New Testament words defines worship as the odd response to the saving acts and praiseworthy character of God you think about the 4 and2 Elders falling down before the lamb what else could they do because they recognized his worthiness and who he was in the Old Testament worship encompassed a variety of activities bringing forward an offering to God was an act of worship bowing down in the presence of God was an outward display of an inner attitude of reverence before the Creator the there was a verb uh in in the original there several uh HEB HEB words translated worship or exalting or lifting up or praise and the word uh room it's rum could indicate that a person was lifting up or exalting God With Praise it's another part of worship it provides a rich image of worship people bow before God and lift him up we we bow before him because of who he is and we lift him up for what he's done right and so the verb uh Halal in in the original was used to the act of celebrating God and I believe he's worthy of celebrating today and and and there was celebration of God that's where we get our word hallelujah which is derived from the Hebrew phrase which means praise Yahweh and the praise could involve uh singing that was a type of Praise zamar Worship could be described as as serving God as well the the old in the old test Testament the uh the the priest who would dedicate their life to the service of God that was worship because their entire life was spent in the service of God there's other words for for praising God it's carried over in the New Testament with words like uh proo which means to bow down as an act of worship and and compto which means bending the knee or bowing and reverence to God there's a word uh for praising God that's doxazo where we get doxology it's the act of giving God glory ulo which is praising or blessing God where we get the word eulogy for telling God who he is you say well God already knows who he is but he wants us to know who he is and to acknowledge who he is you know we have church and and just from my heart this morning you think well I I brother Ben I worship God every day and we should worship God in all that we do and in all that we are and in everything that say in every breath that we have we should worship God at home we should worship God at work we should worship God and yet we know we're distracted by many things and there's many things that happen in our life that we have to work we've got to take care of our families we've got to do those things so we set aside a moment on Sunday morning and on Sunday evening and on Wednesday night for worshiping God and during that time the entire service which even the word service gives you a clue as to what's happening God is serving us the word and we are serving God worship right so he is serving us and we are serving him and so we come to the service to see not just what we can get from God but what we can give to God what what part of uh can we give back to God what is he Desiring what does he want from me today what would please him in my attitude in my actions in everything that I am what would please God today in My Worship so we set aside these times and and you know in a message church we we do peculiar things we we have a a time of quietness before the service and we don't run around in the sanctuary why do we do that why do we have deacons that uh enforce that and set that aside you kids sometimes they'll stop you from running in the church why do we do that it's not because we just want a bunch of rules and we're want to make people feel bad we do that because this is a place of worship this is a place that we've designated it could be any place it could be a field but we've chosen this place to come together and and this is a place where Lord I'm going to focus on you I'm going to forget about everything else and I'm going to I'm just going to Bear down and focus on the almighty God I I'm going to Bow myself before someone who is so much greater than I could ever be and he can take care of every problem that I have and he's worth worshiping he's worthy of Our Praise but every part of the service is worship from the pre-service to the the singing the offering the everything that's done is worship brother brandham says that this way he said I want to read this morning some of the Bible he said I like the word don't you you like the word oh come on and we get a better response than that you don't have to like the guy that's preaching the word but do you like the word right you like the word I know sometimes we'll say things like that and worship is a response you realize that sometimes we're distracted and and a preacher will get up and say everybody that's a Christian raise your hand three people raise their hand look Danny steam was preaching last night at Christian Tabernacle and I got a kick out of it he said uh turn around and look at all these perfect people you know and everybody turned around and of course nobody's perfect but in the eyes of God they are and then he said he said turn around look at your enemy and tell them you love them or something like that people start looking around you know but but every response that we have is an act of worship that's why when we're asked to do something as a part of worship if we can we should do it and I understand sometimes when we're standing or whatever some of you Elders that you can't stand very long and you have to sit down and that's perfectly fine but when we are asked to do something if we do have the capability of doing that we ought to do that if it's clapping or raising our hands or whatever it is because there's someone up here not just up here you're not up here we're not up here to just make a show brother Allen doesn't get up here so everybody can see his new tie or or his shoes or something like we don't get up here so you can see us we're up here to Lead You In Worship but it's not one-sided see that was the problem with romanism that's a problem with Catholic it become just a priest doing everything and the people just sit back and watch I don't want that to be what our church is or what we are as a part of the Bride of Jesus Christ we got to participate in Worship in whatever way that we can that don't mean you'll be the loudest person in the room it just means in some way there'll be a response to the word of God there's something there that responds when you hear the word is something that grabs a hold of you so he said I like the word don't you he said now we've worked worshiped the Lord now he's he's just beginning his sermon he said we've worshiped the Lord and we'll continue to worship Him He said now let's worship him as a cutting sharp edged sword so during the preaching we're worshiping him as a cutting sharp edged sword as it moves through us to find out where we're standing you realize that's part of worship right we're worshiping him in that way and so our resp response to that is worship and our lack of response to that is worship right it depends on our lack of worship it depends on how worthy you think he is and whether you believe the word being preached or not what response that you have to the word now even I I said and I'll go back to this brother brandham taught us that an offering was part of worship and I'm I'm seeing you know some of these little things matter and I begin to see us in the message we drift away from taking offerings and and I understand why because you don't want to over and I I I've made a commitment we'll just have one offering of service no matter what because I don't want to over uh tax the people that's not what we're here for so we put a box in the back and things like that but but an offering is a part of worship brother brandham says that it's a direct quote he said an offering is a part of worship and he said he in one place in his in his campaigns that he quit doing the offering he said and the Lord didn't bless it he said and people were wondering where can I give my offering because they wanted to Worship in that way he said that's right I know more than that that than that than ever since the other day when I was going to give Hattie right back that $20 that she'd pledged toward the new Tabernacle in Jeffersonville you that know the story of hady Wright you know that she gave brother bandam $20 and the only reason he's in her house because he come to give it back right and when he come to her house to give it back the Lord said don't do that he said the Lord said just let her alone sir he said because the the widow woman walked by and Jesus never stopped her from giving her two mights he didn't want her money he didn't need her money but it was an act of worship and said the Lord said just let her alone he said in a few minutes later I see why he said let her alone because it was that act of worship that led towards her receiving the promise and being the first human being being to ever speak the word and have the word spoken to her in that Supernatural way look at listen that is exactly she wasn't a prophet she wasn't a great person but she was somebody who believed God and was willing to submit herself to the word of God for the hour and say it's nothing but the truth but it began with an offering I'm not saying that to get your money today but I'll say this you young people and brothers that take up the offering we should take that seriously whether there's a whole congre here or just a few of us we should make sure everybody's offering is taken that wants to give and the reason for that is because we we that person wants to Worship in that way they're not just doing that that's a part of their worship it may be a dime it may be a dollar but it's a part of worship and we don't want to we don't want to let that go praise is a part of worship how many believe that this morning praise is a part of worship Psalm 149 says Praise You the Lord sing unto the Lord a new song and his praise in the congregation of saints now again you can worship God wherever you're at you can worship God and sing in the shower but there's a time that we've designated to come together to worship God and to focus on this very thing in a place where we know that he is and so we're going to worship him because he's here so Psalms 149 said sing unto the Lord a new song is praise in the congregation of saints let Israel rejoice in him that made him let the children of Zion be joyful in their King let them praise His name in The Dance Let Them sing praises unto him with the timberl and heart but the lord taketh pleasure in his people he will beautify the meek with salvation now the idea of worship began with the idea of a king so he said let's praise the King and we don't understand As Americans we don't understand what it means to have a king brother Bram talked about how the king would go through and he said Ern Baxter who was a Canadian he said a tear would run down his face because the King was coming by it means something to him and there's a Majesty to that office it would be Unthinkable to not bow in the presence of the king in in old times it would be a desence to not bow in the presence of a king Not only would they bow in the presence of a king but they would bow in the presence of a king's minister or even a king's I'm not saying to bow in the presence of preachers but like a like a head of state they would bow in the presence of they would bow in in the presence of a king's garments or a king's Insignia or the Ring of a king they would actually because they were submitting themselves to a higher authority listen you don't have to submit yourself to me but you do have to submit yourself to him and if the king is in the room what kind of attitude should we have the king's in the room you say well I left my my my cro poot on I'm afraid it's going to burn but the king's in the room are you with me now I oh I I I've had trouble at work this week but the king is in the room I've struggled with with neighbors I've got trouble with my neighbor I got trouble with my family I got trouble at the church but the king is in the room then what should we do when we come in the room this is a house of worship this is not a place for me to elevate my complexes this is not a place for you to elevate your complexes this is a house of worship this is a place where we lift him up where we lower oursel and we lift him up and I say Lord be lifted up Among Us be lifted up be welcome Among Us amen take pleasure in your people he said let them praise His name in The Dance Let Them sing praises unto him with a timberl and harp for the lord taketh pleasure in his people he will beautify the meek with salvation oh I love that you think of this sense of awe the sense of reverence that would come with being in the presence of a king you wouldn't have time to get on your phone and and look on Facebook you wouldn't even think of it if you knew you in the presence of a king right and that's why we take this time to get apart from all that stuff right we take we wouldn't have time to to sit there and well you know I don't think brother so and so really likes me but you're not in brother so and so's presence you're in the presence of the king and so we don't come together to worship us we come together to worship the king there's an awe and a reverence that comes with that sometimes weeping comes with that in the presence as ER backer the tear run down his face because of the king and it's not necessarily because you're a sinner many times You Weep because just the presence of the king you realize that he's here and when you recognize that he's here it does something to you it it squeezes your heart as I've heard I'm sure you've heard brother Daryl Ward say that he said he squeezes your heart and the juice runs out your eyes but it's just a it's it's his presence and that's a Biblical form of worship lifting up of hands crying shouting dancing singing all biblical forms of worship listen we didn't make that up and when someone accuses me of being Pentecostal the Assemblies of God didn't make up dancing in the spirit right and the people of the people of the world didn't make up dancing in the spirit before there was ever a rock and roll party there was dancing in the spirit before there was ever a a a sports Stadium filled with screaming fans there were sons of God when the morning Stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for Joy brother brandom they told Brother brand they said you got some of this new religion where you where you shout and things like that he said no I got a a new case of oldtime religion amen a new case of old time religion he said because he said that when the morning Stars sang together I was there when the sons of God shouted for joy in the mind of God I was there that's that's been going on forever we didn't start that and I think sometimes we lose track because we did have a voice of authority in our age and it's not me right it's a prophet in our age that was a voice of authority because we had the the written bible we had to have somebody to come and tell us the light bring the light to those scriptures and and so I would follow the example of a prophet and the words of a prophet before I would follow my own words or what I feel like when it comes to worship and a lot of people for whatever reason I I told you you know it seems like we're doing away with offerings and it's like we begin and I'm not criticizing other people I'm just thinking ourselves what we want to do what we want to be but it it seems like we're also doing with worship especially at the end of the service you realize why we do that because brother brandom taught us to do that right sir now now look how brother brandom defines worship he said I like to worship don't you he said now we don't come to church just to hear a sermon that goes with it but we come to church to worship Worship in the spirit and in truth he said you've heard the truth that's the word now to worship is to express yourself to him this is how you feel about him oh church and I know many of you feel about God you feel that he's holy you feel that that that he's great you feel his majesty you feel his love you feel that you you you you feel that but many times we don't know how to express it but worship is something that we learn to do to express the word of God and it has nothing to do because you could be a worshipper you could be someone who worships God not be a seed of God but a seed of God will worship God right you could be a you could be someone who was a a Cain Cain built an altar but he didn't worship under the blood but you and I are under the blood we're under the atonement an atonement of the token an atonement of the Holy Ghost an atonement of the message of the hour you think about where we're at and what we believe and and what time it is it's a time for worship if there ever was one but uh that worship now he said you've heard the truth he said that's the word to worship is to express yourself to him I want him to know how I feel about him right now you know you have special time set aside for your wife special time set aside for your children special time set aside for your family some people do that in birthdays we're not much of on birthday parties I we didn't do them that much we had parties but I I my birthday was in July and my party was in May so we kind of lumped all that together big family you know and it's it's fine I have no I don't have any issues from that I've not had to see anybody about it but but you know that's just what we did we're not big birthday party but we do take special time for people and I remember one of the things my dad would do is he'd take me with him to work on his birthday and and we'd get to go what for a few years there when we were younger we would go with him because he was a traveling salesman sold Insurance we' go with him and we would uh get that day off from school or whatever we were doing and and we'd go play Ministry golf it was a big deal I remember how badly I felt one day cuz we were leaving and it was pouring rain just dumping rain and dad said no miniature golf today man this was my chance to go to McDonald's in the mall and and and get a Happy Meal cuz we never got to get a Happy Meal right so you got to get one once once a year twice a year something like that it's too expensive to get everybody a Happy Meal so you got a Happy Meal and then you uh then you uh you got to go to the miniature golf place we and and that day I I remember that feeling I still remember that and sitting there in my little heart and how man it's so terrible and then the sun come out and I think we ended up playing miniature golf but I remember the feeling that I had because today was my day right wonder how God feels we said it side Sunday morning for a couple hours try not to drag out the service I wonder how he feel sometimes when we come in all we got and running our minds complexes all we got is our insecurities and what we've been through and we're afraid and Lord I need your help I need your help and that's good we we need he he does help us he does it over and over again but I watched these young people you know when they went to camp and how they worshiped God at camp and and they worship God here too and all of you do and I'm proud of you but but you know when you set aside that special time why do people tend to worship more at Camp well it's the atmosphere and you set aside that time and you're away in a place where your phone don't work and nothing works and you're just sitting there you're with other people and so you just worship you just worship there's nothing else to do I wonder how many of you know we're not present sometimes at our kids' birthday parties I'm not rebuking you for that but you know how it is you kind of you go you're there but you're not there wonder how that kid feels right if you've been a kid maybe you know how that feels I wonder when we celebrate the King how he feel sometimes when we just clock in and cluck out you ever think about it we just came and we had our church we had our service we we we did Church order we we did everything we're supposed to do we sang Our three songs and we get up at the end we sing a song we leave I wonder if he felt welcome I wonder if I wonder if he he felt like he'd the need that he had for worship that's the whole reason he made you was to worship and you realize he'll do anything to get that out of your life and sometimes you wonder why have I been through what I've been through and many times you know it's not punishment and I talking to the brothers about that earlier it never is we talked about that Wednesday night God can't punish you because you're in his body and you already paid your the price for your sins he cannot punish you no matter how bad or how wrong you've been if you're born again you can't can't be punished for sin right you can be corrected but I wonder how many times it's just from he wants to get that worship out of our lives and he realizes the only way to do that is just allow us to be squeezed a little bit and maybe we get sick or we get in trouble or and all of a sudden people begin to worship you begin to see it and as a pastor you know people have said well brother Ben are you scared slow times will come and are you scared of a depression are you scared of persecution no because I've seen during times of uh when the economy was tied and the people didn't have any money I've been to Africa I've been to the Philippines I I've been to Egypt I've been to different parts of the world I've been to those places where there's persecution I've sat there and preached when there was there was a guy with a machine gun sitting outside the door waiting on a terrorist to come across the street I've been there I've preached under that kind of protection and I've sat there in a Muslim area and watch them people worship God with all of their heart and they don't know what you know they didn't have what we have I I preached in an Evangelical Church didn't even know about the message but when they heard the message of the hour they rejoiced to hear it they they pulled on the gift of God why because there was something in their heart to respond to that even though all you say are you scared of that happening no it would just bring a worship out of our Lives what causes us to not worship many times is the is the curse of leoa which is soft living that's what makes us the way we are many many times it's just and not to say I want anything bad I don't want anything bad to happen to you but I'll say this our worship has got to come from the heart and sometimes the only way you can get that from us is to let us go through a little bit of a hard time we got to learn to express ourself we got to learn to be present in worship and not just there the Old Testament they were commanded to worship but our worship comes from the heart should be sincere we should sing from the heart Psalms 138:1 I will praise thee with my whole heart you realize that's why we have to forgive one another because we can't praise him with our whole heart if we keep unforgiveness in our heart you realize if you've held on to bitterness for years it's been years since you really worshiped God I got real quiet but now think about it that bitterness just keeps you because he got to worship with with your whole heart said before the gods will I sing praise unto thee speaking to yourselves Ephesians 5:19 the New Testament in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing and making Melody where in your heart to the Lord should come from the heart Colossians 3:16 let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in what songs hymns spiritual songs singing with Grace you got to have a revelation of grace before you can sing with Grace we preached about that Wednesday night you got to have a revelation of Grace singing with Grace in your hearts to the Lord Brother Band speaks about sincerity and we get caught up a lot of times on music and we think well if it's old it's good if it's new it's bad or sometimes we reverse that and say well if it's new it's good if it's old it's bad and that's not the question at all brother BR talks about these oldfashioned hymns he said where he said what's going with the sincerity where's those oldfashioned hymns we used to sing and rejoice in the spirit of God see there there's the key lots of places sing old hymns and don't Rejoice don't worship but he said where's those oldfashioned HMS we used to sing and rejoice in the spirit of God and tears roll down our cheeks and now we try to hold our breath until we ain't got enough breath in US till her face turns blue to try to show we're some sort of a singer he said see we've copied that off of Hollywood and all these programs that we see through this intellectual hymn singing training of voice he said I like to hear good singing I like to hear good old-fashioned heartfelt Pentecostal singing right he said but I sure hate to hear that squeaking they call singing today so that's right I think that's the most ridiculous thing it's a perversion so it's not a performance and we shouldn't treat treat it like a performance and I'm saying that to both the singer and the congregation right if you sit there and judge the person how they sing and then applaud if you really liked it or maybe a little less if you didn't like it is that worship I'm not against Applause but what should we be doing how do we sing the songs that we sing I can I go off on a little bit of a tangent here I I'm asking your permission you forgive me how do we sing what we sing and not worship sing songs like Oh The Blood of Jesus how do you you can't get that far in The Pongal it just it just overwhelms you we sing songs like our god is awesome he's awesome how does that not inspire a sense of the awe and the presence of God in our in our hearts I think sometimes we get cold with it we we get to where it was just a performance it's just it's just well I'm afraid to sing because I don't know how I sound the people around me and I think we should try to sound good we we should try to blend in with all the other parts of the church but that's not what it's about it's worship and we didn't come to worship you and we didn't come to worship me we come to worship the king and the king is in the room and if he's in the room what should we do what should our reaction be how can we sing a song like on a hill far away stood an Old Rugged Cross an emblem of suffering and shame oh was on that old cross Jesus suffered and died what what how could we sing that how could you sing it as well with my soul and not feel the import of that and recognize it and so I think we ought to worship if you want if you want to help the person singing a special worship while they singing Sometimes some of these songs that you sing I see these young people really I've watched some of these young people change I've seen their attitudes change and and and how they and their faces change and how they sing and how they worship people maybe wouldn't have sung and now they sing with all of their heart to God cuz Something's Happened in their heart and it does something to me sometimes in the back room I'm back there rejo Ing and worshiping tears running down my face and crying out to God because I know where that person come from and I realize they're they're actually worshiping God they're worship I know what they've been through and they're worshiping God we got great singers in this church but it shouldn't be a performance we ought to recognize that's a that's a brother that's a sister and while they worship let me worship while they cry out to God let me cry out to God I'm not rebuking you this morning I just want to I want to see us worship because I know the good that will do to you if you worship sir I know how that worship and how praise and glorifying God fills in the cracks of a church and and welds us together and makes us one and brings unity and brings love and brings forgiveness because we bring our Focus off of our problems and we take our Focus off everything going on and we take our Focus off one another and we look at the K and say he's worthy he's still worthy even though I may not get along with everybody but he's worthy I may not have everything going in my way but he's worthy my kids might be acting oh I want every part of this church every place let the nursery be a place of worship let the back rows be a place of worship let the foyer be a place of worship every part of the church let it be a house of worship in this time that we've designated to give it to God let's give it to him with all of our heart if we're going to do it we might as well do it with all of our heart heart did your dad never tell you that if you had a father present in your life did he never tell you if you're going to do it do it with everything you got if it's worth doing it's worth doing right I say that's a that's right when it comes to the things of the Lord especially New or Old a song has to be heartfelt to be worshiped and you know you think about brother brandom's time the songs that were new then are old now songs that were old then are really old now but I heard someone say that we still sing them not because they're old but because they're good and so we love some of the old songs but only believe was a new song when brother brandham heard it so is down from his glory and wings of a dove the tune to I love him come from a Steven Foster song I don't want to burst your bubble this morning but Steven Foster was not a hyw writer the tune come from Steven Foster My Old Kentucky Home that's he wrote that one too only believe was a jazz tune down from his glory was an Italian love song Right sometimes it's how you sing it right listen and brother brand said oh he said don't that scour you out now that's something I when I think of that I see maybe I'm picturing this wrong but I see a an old uh dish pan or something you know like a Chili pot and and it's sitting there and and and and you take it and it's got all kinds of black on it and stuff and you just take a scrubbing pan you just go to work on it and you get done and it's clean that thing's been rubbed raw man it just if it could speak man you put it through it and brother brand when he gets done preaching a lot of times he'd say doesn't that scour you out don't you feel clean after hearing the word might have hurt but don't you feel clean might have pricked your conscience but don't you feel clean he said don't you love those old songs he said I'd rather have them than all any of these other kind of songs you can have them good old heartfelt song heartfelt songs oh my I feel so good and happy when I seen them just good my just feel like rejoicing now look he said if there's anything I don't like it's an overtrained voice we'll stand up and sing like they got the colic to that we hold their breath till they're black in the face they're not singing they're just making a noise what I like is a good oldfashioned heartfelt Pentecostal Born Again person singing from their heart now listen if you got a trained voice use that trained voice but don't just sing out of training sing because there's something in your heart he said if they can't carry a tune in a bucket they still got the spirit there you listen you can feel it tearing through you oh that when I sing let me sing in the spirit Paul said let it be something that when I sing that people can feel that I believe the words that I'm singing right you know what there's some songs and forgive me for this it's hard to sing Standing on the Promises sitting down right it's just the words don't don't match the actions some Sunday mornings joy unspeakable is a very difficult song to sing right because people don't feel unspeakable the fact that Joy is unspeakable sometimes on Sunday mornings is the fact people don't have any Joy but but it's he's still here he's still worthy I wonder if we could just run those lyrics to our brains a few times just just let them sit in let them settle in what what are we singing what what are we saying what are we saying when we sing songs like I will I will praise him or or I will praise the Lord something like that what how can you how can you sing I will praise the Lord are we talking about a future date are we going to do it when we get home right I know you love me come on you I will praise the Lord when he's just as worthy right now as he ever will be oh God he said now you say well I'm not a singer he said that doesn't matter Make a Joyful Noise then unto the Lord the scripture says so now it's not just singing But shouting you know shouting is a scriptural form of worship now I know some of yall don't know what shouting is but shouting is making a loud noise am right shouting is just being loud that's right well brother Ben I couldn't be loud in church because he said to be quiet in the church go look up what quiet means be still and know that I'm God doesn't mean be like this it means don't be anxious don't worry know that I'm God right but but we shouldn't do things out of order but shouting over the word is not out of order shouting even over over when we're moved by the spirit of God during music is not out of order right I'm going to show you that in a moment now listen the Bible says thus all Israel brought up the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord with with what with shouting that's another thing seems like it's drifting away in our in our age is shouting it seems like we're just worship has become very corporate but I think when God blesses you individually it shouldn't matter if everybody else is shouting or not you know it should maybe the Lord only blessed you with that song everybody else sitting there scratching their head saying what in the world but if it blesses you it blesses you and you ought to be willing to bless the Lord Worship the Lord so the they brought up the Ark of the C of the Lord with shouting with sound of the Cornet it's like a a flute or with trumpets with symbols drums basically making a noise with sultes and harps string instruments guitars imagine what it must have seemed like it comes up just a cacophony of noise and David danced with all his mind you sit there and think well brother Ben you know David brought the ark back wrong not this time I chose that scripture carefully 1 Chronicles 15:28 1st Chronicles 15:28 he said he said they were making a noise with Sul trees and harps what was it it was David not the time he brought it back wrong he made a noise then too but they never consulted of the Prophet but this time he brought it back correctly and he danced in the spirit and when he did Michael despised him in her heart and God shut up her womb in Ezra 3:11 the Bible says when this is when they laid the foundation of the house of the Lord they were so happy I told you people that have been through hard times they know how to worship so why some of our elders know how to worship and just stop there for me some of our elders know how to worship because they know what it's like to go out and the and bck cotton they know what it's like to not have much schooling and they know what it's like to go out you say oh that's just Tales of yesterday but listen they got something in their heart they know they didn't come up in the era that we come up in of so much ease and comfort although we have our own issues our own problems I realize that but they come up in a different era and so the people of God back in the day Baptist shouted and will praise God and the Methodist shouted and praise God and worshiped the Lord why it was because they had had been squeezed out of them through hard times and tribulation and depression and everything else but today we got everything right at our fingertips and it seems like we can't worship him like we used to but I say let today be the day of worship don't look back to what yesterday was but let today be your best time of worship are you still with me this morning look they sang together by course I love that in praising and giving thanks to the Lord so in other words first part of the congregation would sing then another part of the congregation would sing the part of the Levites would sing and they'd sing they'd answer back there was a lot of response in the Psalms it would be one here the the leader would say one sing one verse and the people would sing the next verse and it was back and forth a response because congregational singing is congregational singing right so it's not just a performance but look and all the people shouted oh he said give thanks to the Lord because he's good for his mercy and doth forever toward Israel and all the people shouted with a great Shout when they praise the Lord because the foundation of the house of the Lord was laid you said but you could shout and not have it absolutely you could that don't mean you're saved but the people of God shout are you with me now again Psalm 32:11 be glad in the Lord and rejoice you righteous shout for Joy all ye that are upright in heart I think sometimes what keeps us from really worshiping God is condemnation but don't you realize he said all you that are upright in heart you may have done all kinds of bad things but are you forgiven is it under the blood then you ought to be able to worship like never before if anybody ought to be able to worship it ought to be the person who's been through hell and back and yet they know that God delivered them they know that God brought them out of the pit they know that what they were and they know what they are today it don't bother me you say well that person was a sinner let him praise God let her praise God they know where they come from not scandalized by that you that are upright in the heart you shout for joy and that know that your sins have been forgiven they've been placed under the blood of the Lamb you that make mistakes and are troubled and everything else but yet you know that your heart's right you shout brother BR that's what's the matter with the church today they say I don't believe in that their kind of religion makes you shout and call it heartfelt religion I don't believe in such things as that he said no wonder you've never come into it yet he said you come into it really get under the Shina glory of God when the power of the Holy Ghost is falling down upon you you don't know something happened to you you passed from death into life become a new creature God is first and I know the objection to that is many times well brother Ben is not my nature to shout I want to show you what brother random had to say about that let me say this I I know some people are quiet and and and people can be quiet I'm not quiet in church some people are very quiet in church and I get that but you know it's funny how it spreads right and and you watch people being quiet and and that's good many times there's a reason sometimes there's a purpose for being quiet sometimes we need to be quiet there's times we don't need to be running 100% we need to slow down and be in all the presence of God we need to hear the word right because it doesn't do any good if you can't hear it because it's the word that matters not the emotion that it's given in and yet we want the presence of God to be there yes sir right but but so there's times to be quiet and some people are not you know but if you shout and and what I mean by that is you get real animated at the ball game you can shout in church you just don't now let's just be real honest with ourselves you say well I can't be happy in church it's just I'm always reminded of my sin well somebody come and brought you if everybody that you knew come today and come to your house said we're going to have a day for you today your day and we're all going to bring our gifts and come in and celebrate brother Allen today we're all going to go to your house well brother Allen wouldn't be happy but most people if you all showed up at my house bearing gifts even brother Allen you know you might say well I don't want people in my house but if they all come bring in hunting gear say right right fishing poles and bows and guns and everybody come in brings their present in and says just wanted to bless you today brother Allen you know what you do so woo be a smile on your face you'd have to tell that story every time I'd see you say you wouldn't believe what happened to me everybody in my life come and brought me something oh God you know sometime we act like we don't want it I remember my 30th birthday party I told my wife no party I'm getting old I'm feeling it don't want nothing she said okay first time she's ever listened to me no that's not true at all sister Fritz will get on to me if I say that she knows that's not true sister Fritz was there with us when we were first married she knows how submissive and my wife is and what a wonderful Christian she is but I heard her say one time I'll give this Rose to my wife since it's my anniversary and I I got to spend the next few days with her but sister fris told me one time she said I've never met a a woman that fulfills that part of the scripture more than your wife does as far as being submissive and things for their husband and and supporting their husband I thought that's that's high praise and and I appreciate that I appreciate my wife that's all right I appreciate my wife but you know sometimes we act like we don't want it and I act like I didn't want that 30th birthday celebration but it did and I was at associate pastor at a church and my 30th birthday passed and I didn't get a cake and that day for whatever reason nobody called me people called me the day before or something you know nobody called me nobody contacted me I didn't look at Facebook nobody I pretty down say didn't anybody remember right and I'm the one that did it to myself right now listen if everybody brought you a gift wouldn't you be happy doesn't the psalm say forget not the Lord forget not his benefits he said he daily Loth us with Benefits he brought you health he brought you happiness he brought you salvation he brought you strength he give you a new life he give you a heaven to hope for he give you a body change to look he give you everything in this age he come and open up the storehouse of Heaven oh shouldn't you be happy in the house of God shouldn't I bring a smile to your face cuz he come and he brought you everything he come down from heaven and made himself a man and walked Among Us and if we really believe that and he rose again on the third day and he come back and lived in the church and he's here this morning the king is here this morning and that ought to make every one of us happy it ought to make every one of us excited about that in whatever way we can get excited now look what brother Brandon said you see it's not my nature to shout look at this brother brand says hallelujah he said sure Baptist shout give him just a minute to catch up to me sure Baptist shout brother uh back running the the sound back or the screen back there is like interpreting he's got to figure out what I'm saying and then try to find it but he said Hallelujah sure bab to shout yes sir anybody that's got good religion shouts got something to shout about you may not have much of a shout but there's something response in your life response in your mouth brother brand said there was a black man who lived down the lane from him and and he come brother brand one time he said you believe in that shouting Religion Don't You Billy and he said yes sir he said well I tell you he said you take an old rooster this is the black man speaking to brother brandom he said you can tie his feet nail him down into the box any way you want to but but when it starts to get daylight he'll turn over and Crow heyen he'll turn over and Crow I said that's right he said what makes him do that Billy I said he's a rooster and it's breaking day hallelujah oh there's something in my heart I'm a Christian and he said Shalom little bride Shalom to the bride there's something in you you're a rooster and it's breaking day it's breaking day day for you you've been through a hard night but it's breaking day I don't know who I'm talking to this morning but that you you've been through some things but it's breaking day Now's the Time to Begin to rejoice and praise God because it's breaking day I believe this church we've been through some hard times the whole the bride has as a whole but it's breaking day I see God stirring Hearts again I see him moving again you may not see it but I see it he's it's breaking day it's time for those who are real Christians real roosters to wake up and Crow it's daylight what did he tell us he said there' be gross Darkness on the people but arise and shine for thy light is come time to Crow thank hallelujah hallelujah it's a rooster and it's breaking he's a rooster in it's breaking day that's right it's his nature when a man is born of the spirit of God and has this eternal life in him when the Holy Ghost comes you got to scream out something has to happen I know some of you you know it's kind of a learned practice and some of us we just I wish I could had somebody used to tell me every time I appreciate not here but somebody used to tell me said man said I almost ran today I was that close come on I was I said why didn't you nobody was holding you almost man I felt like it well if you really felt like it go ahead that's right won't bother me a bit I'll keep preaching oh look he said when the Holy Ghost comes you got to scream out something has to happen he said you do believe the good old time heartfelt salvation brings tears of joy and happiness peace that passes all understanding for he's the river amen oh he's my everything I just can't praising him enough and say enough about him what he means to me I wonder if that's us today this is the example that a prophet said he said it's no wonder he said it's a nature in you when you're born of the spirit of God you got a nature in you to make you scream out and he uses that Luke 19 and 40 when they recognized that what the word was being fulfilled there was something in the people they begin to cry out hosana and lay palm branches down in the way why because the King was there and he uses that scripture he answered and said to them I tell you if these should hold their peace the stones would immediately cry out amen he said something had to take place Hallelujah when we see him coming down out of Heaven riding on that white charger you talk about some noise oh there's going to be something to happen then when we see all these things we've talked about brought into reality but there's the key isn't it he was still there on the cross but they weren't shouting CU they didn't recognize him in that form they thought if he was a king he'd have taken over many of the same people who shouted the day before didn't recognize him on the cross wonder if we recognize him today I wonder what kind of attitude we'd have towards the king if we really knew that that he was here you know in Old Times all your whole life depended on the generosity of a king or a noble like everything depended on that you die without the generosity of a king he owned the woods he owned the deer he owned the the pigs he owned the Surfs he owned the land and so you were a subject and so all you can think about is how can I please the king so he'll give me what I have need of he'll provide for me do you realize that everything in this world belongs to God even Satan though he's he's taken it and perverted it he can't even create he can only pervert what God created he has the cattle on a thousand hills his word is law amen and if you recognized the king it was such a sense of awe and Majesty when a person saw their King maybe not somebody else's King but their King when they come in his presence they fell down and prostrated themselves on the ground in awe at that presence pagans would do that before an imaginary God I don't have time to get into this brother Robert I'm sorry I'm going to I'm going to skip through some of this but brother brandom talked about how that that we prostrate ourselves before the king he said and pagans would actually go and prostrate themselves before an idol that they would set up an image of what they thought God looked like and they would take that then and they would prostrate themselves before it and they would imagine in their heart anointed by the devil they would imagine that that that Idol could speak and they lay themselves down and they cry out to it speak speak to me and they thought they heard it speak because in their imagination had grown Wicked and dark and they thought that that piece of wood that they created could actually talk back but brother Brandon tells us that we don't have an imaginary Idol we have a living God how many believe that today we have a living God and a living God is before us Abraham must have seem strange to the idol worshippers Abraham was an idol worshipper but everybody built altars everybody prostrated themselves and worshiped but Abraham did it with no image right to the Unseen God right but listen what brother BR said he said Christian worship is that not that the idol speaks he said but God actually when the worshipper prostrates himself before God when you humble yourself before God when you come into His presence and you let go of all the things that are going on and you just say Lord would you come and what happens is he he don't speak to you he speaks through you oh hallelujah oh he comes he doesn't come into an idol but he comes into living human beings and speaks his own words through men are you with me now and we are his living images created in His image and for his work and for his glory oh then who should be speaking and people I know people question ask say Well only certain people have a right to speak no I think we ought to be speaking the words of God because if we're really worshiping we have to speak because it's his words in us we have to speak and you said but brother Ben that's Pentecostal to worship that's that's the the Baptists even do it now they have praise bands and worship bands worship teams but who should be worshiping what kind of worship who would God receive worship from who who would Delight his heart to worship Him brother B said there's fine people in the world fine churches but there's one Mrs Jesus Christ and that's who he's coming for how many believe that today that's who he's coming for that's where his name lays there is where his worship is in her and her alone oh my so he comes in churches like this think about it I don't want to make this exclusive but but we believe that the bride hears the word of the hour we've heard the word of the Hour come out of her my people and we've come together to be his wife to be his bride of no adulteration or anything of the word the pure word we've been married to Christ the word here on the earth we're going to the marriage supper brother said but we had the wedding happens here and so we've been married to Christ the word what people should worship him more than us it would be a shame if any group on the earth had more worship among them than the bride of Christ did if there was ever I'm not going to leave it I'm not content to leave it to the Pentecostals I'm not content to leave it to the to the rocks to cry out I want to worship him with with all that I've got with everything that I am Hallelujah we have a different take on worship and any other group of people on the Earth as I said because a prophet taught us that he came to turn our hearts back so we can worship from our hearts the message didn't come to turn our heads back come to turn our hearts back and and God must be worshiped Jesus says in John 423 and 24 he's a spirit and he worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth with Brandon preaching he said I just love to feel this way I love to worship God in quietness like this something that's got real meaning to it just to feel that something is near what what happened he said at the altar call when those Sinners accepted Christ I think about it for minut you people come to the Altar and they pray he said when those Sinners accepted Christ you don't realize all Heaven's waiting on you they're waiting on you to give in and they know you're on the schedule but they're just waiting for you to do it right so because if you're a seed of God you're gonna surrender to his will Hallelujah those sinners he said' when those Sinners accepted Christ the Angels raised up from their seats see he said that's what makes you feel this way said this is worship when the soul is worshiping God the word has gone forth see he said the holy spirit is blessing and watering now can I have just a few minutes to to do this I get five minutes from everybody I won't do that but look brother brandom is the one who taught us to worship at the end of the service I've been uh I guess I was blessed or I don't know what you'd call it I grew up going to all kinds of different churches and I've been in Baptist Churches Methodist churches Pentecostal churches uh maybe a Catholic Church I yeah I have been in a Catholic church I've been in all kinds of services everything you can imagine and in that we don't ever find worship after the service they may sing a song and they go home the worship is before brother brandom taught us we do worship before but we worship our main worship is after did you know that our main worship is after the preaching and now I'm preaching it myself maybe as preachers ought to leave more time for it but look that's unique to the message listen to how brother brandham did it he said our heavenly father is the beautiful sacred presence of the Holy Spirit now standing here blessing his children many times he's had to correct them for every son that cometh to God must first be chastened and tried received child training reproofs not no exceptions everyone but when we endure the correction of our father it yith forth the present and pleasant a pleasant fruit I pray God that you just let each child know that not go away just kind of Imagine but let them know that this is your blessings to them so the word has come he said let them know that this is your blessings to them the sincere milk of the Gospel pouring down in their soul milk and honey out of canaan's land new wine to stimulate them in faith worshiping Hearts bowed before thee hands up tears running down cheeks quietly reverently worshiping and there's a time again as I said for shouting and worship and praise and the symbols and everything else but sometimes when the word is there and it's been preached it's just a reverence to it what is it you're submitting yourself to the word what are you doing when you worship after the word comes out you're saying God I know you're right I may not be right but I know you're right I'm acknowledging the word is true I'm acknowledging you were here in your word and because you are the word I'm acknowledging that Lord and I'm saying Lord change me make me different cleanse me wash me out I Love You Lord Oh my he said oh God I'm so happy I just love you so Lord I want to express to you my feeling if I can just in Thanksgiving expressing the very Adoration of my heart that I adore thee thou matchless one I love thee you said but brother Ben you got to have a sermon on worship to worship that's not true that was in Revelation book of symbols look at the worship after the seals but the brandom wasn't working it up but it was just there because the Holy Spirit brother Stuart mentioned it the other day when you preach this message huh there's a different anointing that comes with that and the spirit of God moves sometimes in here on Wednesday night I know we're all tired but sometimes I can't hardly even leave because I know the presence of God is so real why he's honoring his word not cuz I preached it no matter who preached it he honored his word listen he said just the Holy Spirit just cleaning your heart from all unbelief putting you right back in track with God again you see the importance of that little time we have at the end of service he said oh now is the time to worship him the message is over let's just worship him once again in this song as we sing I love him and I know some of you are elders and things and you got to get up and go and you got reasons for that and I understand that and if you have to leave I I say if you have to leave early that's fine but those of us who can stay and worship just even a little bit even if it's just a minute but just long enough to tell him Lord I love you I praise you I'm I'm going to I'm going to thank you for the word I'm going to soak in it for just a minute because you're good Lord oh God see brother Ram taught us to think about what we what has been preached while we worship he said the message is over let's just worship him once again in the song He said everyone just quietly and sweetly close your eyes look with your spiritual eyes he preached about Elijah and the meal offering and he said look with your spiritual eyes towards him see what he done for that Widow if you're a widow here this morning or someone who who who doesn't have a husband to provide for you look he said see what he did for that Widow you're as dear to him as that Widow he's preserved your life too don't you love him isn't that a reason to worship amen see worship is obedience did you know that especially worship after the word cuz sometimes it is hard sometimes we hear things we don't like and that maybe we're doing something and the word speaks against that and it bothers us but then when we worship our heart begins to cleanse the word the washing of the water of the word begins to work in our life because we're acknowledging yeah I heard that but I still love you Lord I heard that and that hit me right to the own that that two-edged sword that just cut me but I still love you worship is obedience we surrender ourselves to the word in worship brother when the father finds a child that's obedient how he likes to come and say now watch He's dramatizing this as if the Holy Spirit would go to the father and we know they're the same person but he's dramatizing it the Holy Spirit you said would come to the father you see when the father finds a child that's so he likes to come and say sir your boy is a perfect child how obedient your children are now how are they obedient how they love to worship you they gather together all right all right right isn't that what we're doing is an act of obedience oh I don't want to be disobedient to the word we come together out of obedience to the word how he likes to come and say sir your boy is a perfect child how obedient your children are how they love to worship you they gather together they raise their hands the tears run down their cheeks they're just so full of joy how the Holy Spirit must love to do that for God is an object of worship and God wants to be worshiped in spirit and in truth Jesus said so but we get so starchy we just can't make a grunt he come among us what we did was what he got out of us if we did that at our kids birthday party think about it for a minute at the time you set aside for you and your wife maybe go out on a date go out to dinner you just sit there and grunt at her the reason why she's mad are you with me now you're taking texts on your phone and your other place I'm preaching to myself too these kids they know riding with me Landon's learned that if I'm I'm on the phone if I'm in the car so everybody just learns to you know if you ride with me everybody just learned that's I'm either on the phone or I'm preaching at somebody so that's just what we do you know and and we're busy but if I take that time with my wife I gotta I got to focus sometime it might as well be now we get so starchy we can't make a grunt we couldn't say Amen we just sit there he said see how the Holy Spirit must dread to say that to the father but when we are obedient and love him and praise him and give him glory how the Holy Spirit must love to bring that to him oh I want to have the kind of services I want to be the kind of worshipper that the Holy Spirit could go back and say father I was there with them in service today and they worshiped you they lifted their hands to you the tears run down their face they they loved you they didn't all Worship in the same way but each one of them their heart was in it oh my you know he'd say father you know your son's just like you oh it's just perfect and if we'd say it here in our street expression just a chip off of the block why he loves you he's obedient again brother BR said Don't You Love to Worship the messages sometimes so cutting with the word but then you know after we've all been corrected and stand Guiltless in the presence of the father restic upon the grace of the Lord Jesus I'd just love to raise my hands and worship him don't you like to do that he said how many believes in that raise up your hands oh my just worship Him in song he talked about the prayer line how the people were anticipating that he said think of the one that we worship is that now we see that he's here he's forgave our sins he's sweet and kind to us now let him appear in you and in me that's the purpose of worship so he can speak back through his living Idol he can speak back through you let him appear in you and me and work his works as he promised to do he said he's real who made the flowers who put the colors in them the same man that put the color in the flower put the holy ghost in my heart glory to God he's here yes sir don't be alarmed at him because he's here God means worship God is an object of worship and I love to worship him he's My All In All he's my peace he's my father my mother he's all that I ever had all ever will be everything lays within him so oh my just raise our hands and praise him oh Lord I just don't know what to say Lord he said the spirit of your presence is just packing my soul from place to place you know what that feels like I've been there many times where it seems like the presence of God with just taking your soul from Revelation to Revelation to Revelation and you sit there in his presence and just say thank you Lord thank you Lord I know I've had a tough we I know things have been going on but I see you packing me from place to place showing me how much you love me showing me how oh if we can come to the presence of God like that he said don't let it break forth tonight Lord that's what I've asked for granted Lord hallelujah hallelujah I'm going to have to move on Hallelujah he said bless us Lord we wait on you we wait for you to guide us send us anywhere do anything with us you want to take us in your hand you're the Potter we're the clay mold us and make us after your own way Lord make us images of God hallelujah you say I must skip way down brother Robert I'm sorry Matthew 18:20 tells us where two or three here gathered together my name there am I in the midst of them you say well brother Ben I don't feel anything when I feel it I'll worship you know that's not how we worship do you know that he's here now he promised in his word that he was here and we had a prophet who stood up and said this is my Ministry to declare him that he is here to say he's here and and brother BR says this he's talking about Mary when the angel come to her he said this he said just start thinking about him and worship him in your heart and all of a sudden you'll feel the close Fellowship of the holy spirit all around you and it gets so anointed till you can't hold it any longer you'll raise up your hands or do something you just can't stand still when it comes see what what a worship this was as we come back to our text what a worship this was when they all fell down before the lamb said listen what a worship this was the elders the Beast everything fell right before him he said see like that when he made his complete plan it's time of worship now who should worship us when should we worship now brother Brown said the the first of the 14th verse of the fifth chapter of Revelation reveals the time for the lamb to be worshiped both in heaven and in Earth the seven seal book The worthy lamb the Kidman Redeemer and from the 8 verse to the 14th Angels worship Him Elders worship Him living creatures worship Him and John worshiped him now brother brandham it's not real a parent from the scripture but brother Bram pulls that out and he turns it around and play on words he says that I I John heard I John he said John worshiped he said tell everything I heard him he said and John worshiped him so much every creature in heaven and the Earth underneath the Earth heard me saying blessings Glory power wisdom might be to the lamb who was John a type of the Bride during this worship time who was worshiping the elders were worshiping the four beasts were worshiping the the the powers were worshiping the Angels were worshiping but now the bride was worshiping Hallelujah he said it's the worship time for the king lamb oh my now look he said now the church is gone remember it's showing what's happening in heaven but think about there will be a time of worship in heaven in fact it'll be forever you realize that's all will for eternity is worship in whatever way that that plays out I don't know but it's worship time for the king lamb you say well after the church is gone and the church age is over what is this bride time I don't mean I know we're still in leosa I realize that but this is the bride part right this is us for us it's bride time this was a great time of worship Worship in the heaven it's also a great time of worship here on the earth see worship is in order in the house of God how many realize that brother Brandon when he set the church in order he said course somebody worshiping the Lord that's expected that's what it should be that's what you're here for just if you feel like praising God or shouting just go right on cuz that's what you're here for see but is to Worship the Lord in your own way of worshiping see this is a temporary place of worship musicians go ahead and come I'm almost done this is a temporary place of worship the B said this little Tabernacle along with the temple that Solomon built him along with the others are only temporary places of worship until the time comes when the real Tabernacle will be set upon the Earth he said well I wish I could have been there during that time when brother Brandon was speaking and and bringing the seals what a worship that that was well I wish I could have been there too but God didn't choose for me to worship him there he chose for me to worship him here not in that tab but in this Tabernacle in Word of Life Tabernacle in Ben prits Tabernacle this Tabernacle of Flesh and you say well won't it be a time when we get up there and I think of that song but the jewel used to sing it he said won't it be a time walking with the angels and as brother juel I've watched our precious brother juel as he's gotten older and had difficulties in his body and I'm thinking one day there he'll have his strength again to be able to sing won't it be a time that song has more meaning than it ever did I think some of you as you get older you begin to realize it has more meaning than it ever did won't it be a time but brother Bram tells us not to wait till that time he said let us purpose in our heart today while we have our strength while we have our voice let us purpose in our heart today that in commemoration and waiting for that Tabernacle to come that we will so characterize oursel by his Spirit we will worship in this place this place as if we were in that other place waiting for that place to come sir what did they sing when they worshiped they saying thou are worthy sing a new song they could only sing th are worthy in other words you know worthy means you deserve [Music] it I want to ask you is he less worthy today than he was in John's time is he less Worthy is he less deserving than he was in 1963 when the seals were open I don't believe he is if anything he's just unfolded himself more he just revealed himself more is he less worthy because we're the bride I would think us being the bride to be that much more worthy CU he's our husband our our leader our creator Our God our King he's here we've been taught that by a prophet we've been told that by the scriptures we've been taught that from the word and we know it because we we sense his presence God allows us to feel him you believe that brother BR said a man that believes God can feel God and know that he's there we we know that he's here there's something different about the service he's here in our midst and he promised to be here then if he's here he's worthy is he less worthy because the trouble we're going through we need to challenge ourselves sometimes is he less worthy because we're struggling no he's worthy he's worthy he worthy as he ever was ever will be so if he's worthy and he's here let me worship him from my heart with all my heart with everything that I have could we do that today let's just let's just practice a little bit as if he was here you just think about it you close your eyes and think about it as if he was here cuz he is and if you have a need today and you come with a need the altar is open we'll be glad to pray with you that's a part of worship we love to pray with you this is where we're not here to judge you we this where you find help he said why an altar well because many times it takes that because you got to humble yourself God can meet you where you're at but many times it takes a humility in our lives to bring us before him is he worthy today just imagine as if he was here he is here but can you make yourself believe it can can you really make yourself believe it can you say Lord I I know it I know it I know your word is true I I recogn that you're here you come in a prophet and showed us that you were here but not you didn't stop there you're here today the same yesterday today and forever and if he's here I'm going to Worship You Lord Heavenly Father Lord Jesus I want to worship you today with all of my heart Lord I pray that the children would worship you as I saw even a a young child last night a little baby that had seen people in church raise their hands or was something when you heard the music begin to go he began to raise his hands and worship I said oh God he may not even realize what he's doing but you receive that even from the heart of a baby if he could recognize the presence of God oh how about us what about us Lord I realize Lord that you promised to be here and I don't want to put on a show I don't want it to be about me I want you to be welcome I want you to be real Among Us oh God and I know you want to be I know you want to reveal yourself to every heart but Lord may we worship as if we were seated right before the throne and then you invited us up into it he said come here come here Child come here my bride come with me to the throne you are not oh God you cannot be cursed you cannot be judged you cannot be you've been acquitted in the court of Heaven you stand as though you never did it in the first place now come here with me oh God that we can worship you as if that has already happened because it has oh Lord would you allow us to press through the veil of this flesh and just give you the praise that you deserve Lord if there's anything in our hearts that would be would be wrong take it out oh God just don't let us sit here Lord with acrimony and fear and hurt complexes Lord take it out of us may your spirit may your Holy Spirit begin to Sav the wounds that cutting that the word does let it let it be healed by the Holy Spirit we pray in Jesus name Hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus I know you just worship Him in your own way just just he's right there with you if you have a need just just present it to him Lord I know you'll feel it you're here Lord I know you'll do it let's just sing and worship him with all of our heart hallelujah thank you Lord hallelujah oh we worship you today Lord Jesus Hallelujah hallelujah oh I'm coming back to the Heart of Worship oh and it's all about you oh oh can you just adore him for a minute church just let him
