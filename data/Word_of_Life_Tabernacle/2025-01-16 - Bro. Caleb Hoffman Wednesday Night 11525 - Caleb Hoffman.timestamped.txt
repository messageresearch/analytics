[42:20] about a year and a half ago now and
[42:23] we've been out there for a little bit
[42:24] and uh we bring greetings from our
[42:26] pastor their true word brother Wayne
[42:27] Lawson and uh he asked s just to greet
[42:29] the church and so uh we sure do
[42:32] appreciate him having us here and we ask
[42:34] you guys just y'all just bear with me
[42:36] y'all just bear with us so we look
[42:38] forward to if y'all would please stand
[42:39] for the reading of the word we're going
[42:40] to begin in the Book of Joel the 2
[42:42] chapter verse
[42:51] 28 amen J Joel 2:28 it would say and it
[42:55] shall come to pass afterward that I will
[42:57] pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and
[43:00] your sons and your daughters shall
[43:02] prophesy your old men shall dream dreams
[43:04] and other men young and your young men
[43:06] shall see visions and from there reading
[43:09] a few passages of scripture from acts
[43:10] the 2 chapter verse
[43:13] 14 it would say but Peter standing up
[43:16] with the 11 lifted up his voice and said
[43:18] unto them ye men of Judea and all ye
[43:21] that dwell of Jerusalem be this known
[43:23] unto you and hearken to my words for
[43:26] these are not drunken as you suppose he
[43:28] didn't say they weren't drunk he said
[43:29] they weren't drunk as you suppose seeing
[43:32] it is but the third hour of the day but
[43:34] this is that which was spoken by the
[43:35] prophet Joel and then one more place
[43:38] Romans the 8th chapter beginning in
[43:39] verse 9 it would say but ye are not in
[43:42] the flesh but you're in the spirit and
[43:45] if it so be that the spirit of God dwell
[43:47] in you now if any man have not the
[43:49] spirit of Christ he is none of his
[43:51] that's a powerful statement right there
[43:53] if you have not the spirit of Christ he
[43:55] is none of his and if Christ in you the
[43:57] body is dead because of sin but the
[44:00] spirit is life because of righteousness
[44:02] but if the spirit of him that raised up
[44:04] Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that
[44:06] raised up Christ from the dead shall
[44:07] also Quicken your mortal bodies by his
[44:09] spirit that dwelleth in you amen God
[44:12] bless you this evening I would like to
[44:13] take for a title this evening the
[44:14] Dynamics in you amen let's bow our heads
[44:17] for a moment of prayer Lord Jesus we ask
[44:20] you just come in this service father
[44:21] Lord we love you and we thank you we
[44:23] appreciate the opportunity to be able to
[44:24] gather here Lord and to worship you
[44:26] father Lord to hear your word come forth
[44:28] Lord as we enter into this portion of
[44:30] the service I ask that you would just
[44:31] move this broken vessel aside father
[44:33] Lord you know every need you know every
[44:35] heart throughout this building I ask
[44:36] that Lord you would just move in a
[44:37] mighty way you would just move upon the
[44:39] souls father Lord whatever need they
[44:41] have I ask that you would just speak
[44:42] through me father that your word would
[44:43] come forth and would meet their need we
[44:45] put the service into your hands we love
[44:47] you in Jesus name we pray amen amen
[44:50] y'all can be seated this evening brother
[44:52] Brandon would say in the rising of the
[44:54] sun there's been churches churches
[44:56] Brides Brides churches brides and Brides
[44:59] but there's got to come one Hallelujah
[45:01] there's got to come a rule bride there
[45:03] must come one that's not only got the
[45:05] mechanics but the Dynamics of it that
[45:07] makes that church live that moves in the
[45:09] power of his resurrection until we come
[45:12] to that place until we find that place
[45:14] what good does it do to polish the hubs
[45:16] what good does it do to give her a
[45:18] facelift or a simonized job when there's
[45:19] no Dynamics in it no matter how much the
[45:22] mechanics proves to be right there's got
[45:24] to be a Dynamics to make it work no
[45:27] matter how much it proves to be right
[45:28] there's got to be a Dynamics to make it
[45:30] work so tonight taking for a title the
[45:33] Dynamics in you not just in the message
[45:36] not just in William brandom not just in
[45:37] your pastor not just in some preacher
[45:39] but the Dynamics in you I me here in
[45:41] Romans 8 these few verses we just read
[45:43] these scriptures there scriptures you
[45:45] know we've read our entire lives and
[45:46] most of us can recite it from memory but
[45:48] in this passage Paul would say four
[45:49] different times the spirit of Christ in
[45:51] you not above us not below us not around
[45:54] us not even just with us but that Spirit
[45:55] must be in you
[45:57] the prophet would say again in the
[45:58] rising of the sun it just won't move no
[46:00] matter how good the mechanics is until
[46:02] the Dynamics come when the Dynamics come
[46:05] that fire is made to connect with the
[46:06] octane in the gasoline and when that
[46:09] explodes it causes a combustion and that
[46:11] combustion moves every motion every move
[46:14] for he is the same yesterday today and
[46:15] forever that's the resurrection that is
[46:18] the real power of God the mechanics with
[46:20] the Dynamics amen that is the
[46:22] resurrection that is the real power of
[46:24] God and me I believe this evening that
[46:26] as the Bride of Jesus Christ we're at
[46:27] war with the devil we're at war with
[46:29] hell brother Brandon would say if Satan
[46:31] isn't fighting you it would mean that
[46:32] he's already got you I believe we're
[46:34] living in an age of War and we know that
[46:35] the Bible would tell us that this war
[46:36] that we are in it's we wrestle not
[46:38] against flesh and blood it's not a
[46:40] carnal War that's a revelation I believe
[46:41] we all must come to that this war cannot
[46:43] be won with the mind it's not a war that
[46:45] can be won with psychology it's not a
[46:47] war that can be won with intelligence or
[46:48] with any any sort of physical strength
[46:50] because it's not a a carnal war that
[46:52] we're struggling with it's a spiritual
[46:54] battle it's a spiritual war and the
[46:56] prophet would say in the first seal the
[46:57] angel of the church catches the mystery
[46:59] talking about brother brandom now not
[47:00] fully yet revealed but when he does he
[47:03] catches this mystery and he goes to the
[47:05] people after the mystery has been given
[47:06] to him he goes to the people and what
[47:08] does he do he begins to Proclaim that
[47:10] message and what does it start a war a
[47:12] spiritual war and then when the angel
[47:14] messenger proclaims the message it
[47:16] starts a spiritual war why does it start
[47:17] a war because the enemy knows that
[47:20] without this message the bride is
[47:21] defenseless our enemy knows that the
[47:23] only way for the bride to make a Rapture
[47:25] is through the message of the hour and
[47:26] so when the message is proclaimed it
[47:28] starts a war now we know that we cannot
[47:30] fight a spiritual battle with natural
[47:32] devices you can't fight a spiritual
[47:34] battle with just mechanics but in order
[47:36] to fight a spiritual enemy it's going to
[47:37] take a spiritual weapon it's going to
[47:39] take a spiritual Power Man brother
[47:41] brandham he would preach on the
[47:42] mechanics and Dynamics many times
[47:45] throughout his ministry but probably the
[47:46] most well-known is here in Rising of the
[47:48] sun which is where we're taking our
[47:50] thought out of 1965 this is the last
[47:52] Easter message that the prophet of God
[47:54] would ever preach it's just a few months
[47:55] before he goes off the scene and and the
[47:57] prophet he would draw us in this in this
[47:59] sermon to recognize that without the
[48:01] Dynamics without the spirit of God just
[48:03] hearing or just listening to this
[48:04] message can do you no good because you
[48:06] can have all the parts of the machine
[48:07] you can have everything oiled and
[48:09] everything greased just right you know
[48:11] you can go through all the process you
[48:12] can go through all the plans you can go
[48:13] through everything you can have you can
[48:15] have all the machines you can have you
[48:17] look at a car you can have the
[48:18] crankshaft you can have it you can have
[48:20] it tuned down just right you can have
[48:21] all the nuts and bolts torqued down to
[48:23] just exactly the right amount you can
[48:25] have everything old everything but until
[48:27] you p a gasoline into that engine and
[48:29] there's a spark to light it then that
[48:32] the mechanics will do it no good all the
[48:33] fine tuning doesn't do it no good
[48:35] polishing the hubs doesn't do no good
[48:37] because until there is a source of power
[48:38] that's applied to those mechanics it
[48:40] cannot run it cannot work all it is is a
[48:42] model I remember one time I was a little
[48:44] boy and I was mowing our yard I was
[48:46] probably 12 13 years old and our lawn
[48:47] mower I remember we were driving through
[48:49] dad had a he had an old zero attorney
[48:51] probably still has it and I was mowing
[48:53] the yard and our mower just stopped
[48:54] right there in the middle of the yard
[48:56] and you know I remember I get off and
[48:57] Dad wasn't available to come out there
[48:59] and so I remember thinking I'm going to
[49:00] impress my daddy I'm going to get off
[49:02] and I'm going to fix this lawn mower so
[49:03] I get off there I remember I pulled up
[49:05] the seat I did everything I knew how to
[49:07] do things that had nothing to do with
[49:08] the engine I was I was checking this I
[49:10] was checking the uh the battery making
[49:12] sure the terminals were clean I pull out
[49:14] the dipstick made sure there was oil I
[49:15] pull out the air filter clean out the
[49:16] air filter I did absolutely everything I
[49:18] knew I got under it checked that the
[49:19] belts were on the pulley and everything
[49:21] and I thought well it's just no lawn
[49:22] mower it's probably just gave up the
[49:24] ghost this lawnmower is probably just
[49:26] over with so so after a little while dad
[49:27] comes out there and I remember he he
[49:29] asked what's going on and I tell him
[49:31] everything I just done the whole process
[49:32] I gone through everything i' done to fix
[49:34] this L Mower and the first thing he
[49:36] tells me is he said does it have any gas
[49:37] in it and I went and I looked and sure
[49:39] enough that was the driest gas tank that
[49:41] you ever seen we put gas in it and that
[49:42] thing started up just fine but you know
[49:44] I had checked for everything except for
[49:46] the source of power I had gone through
[49:47] all the processes I made sure that all
[49:49] the mechanics were running perfectly
[49:51] smooth and I never gave a thought to the
[49:52] fact that maybe the thing that made the
[49:54] mechanics run wasn't there and the
[49:56] prophet of God in the rising of the sun
[49:58] he would tell the church you're
[49:59] polishing the hub caps you're fine
[50:01] tuning them in the machine you're oiling
[50:02] the mechanics expecting the machine to
[50:04] run but until there is a combustion that
[50:06] sets those mechanics in motion that
[50:08] machine will not move until you get the
[50:10] power of God moving in the church the
[50:12] mechanics cannot run the bride cannot
[50:14] work the body cannot move what is the
[50:16] power of God brother bandham said the
[50:18] Dynamics in you is the power of God Amen
[50:21] I believe this evening with every F of
[50:23] my beinging we've got the power of God
[50:24] in our midst I believe we've seen the
[50:26] power of God we felt the power of God
[50:28] not only have we seen it not only have
[50:30] we felt it but I believe that that power
[50:31] has been inside of us it's been placed
[50:33] inside of us on the inside of us it's
[50:35] been quickened in us until we don't just
[50:36] talk about it we don't just sympathize
[50:38] with it it's not just something that we
[50:39] agree with it's not just something we
[50:41] sit around and talk about but it's
[50:42] actually a part of who we are brother
[50:44] Brandon would say that he said that God
[50:45] is not calling for a group of people
[50:47] that are going to sit around and talk
[50:48] about the message he said that he's not
[50:50] calling for a group of people they're
[50:51] just going to sympathize with it they're
[50:52] just going to talk about it they're just
[50:53] going to agree with it they're just
[50:55] going to say that sounds good but
[50:56] brother Brandon said he's looking for a
[50:58] group of people that are going to get in
[50:59] the message amen and brother Brandon
[51:01] would say in the seven Church ages that
[51:03] was sets the body of Christ apart from
[51:05] the rest of the world from the rest of
[51:06] the church that she speaks with the
[51:08] power of God she moves with the power of
[51:10] God that's what sets you apart from the
[51:11] rest of the world tonight is that there
[51:13] was a power that was placed on the
[51:14] inside of you from before the foundation
[51:16] of the world that gives you the ability
[51:18] to speak healing into existence he gives
[51:20] you the power to send Devils Back To
[51:21] Hell it gives you the power to overcome
[51:23] this evil age because you have a power
[51:25] only inside of you that is greater than
[51:27] any other power on the face of the Earth
[51:29] in another place for the prophet would
[51:30] say see where we are at we see Nations
[51:33] breaking Israel Awakening the signs that
[51:35] this Bible for told for this day if that
[51:37] ain't more true for right now than any
[51:38] other time I don't know what it is he
[51:40] said we see the mechanical things taking
[51:42] place but now the spirit the Dynamics of
[51:45] that promised word to get into the
[51:46] church and to drive them into Calvary
[51:49] and to the Rapture amen the Dynamics
[51:51] will drive you into Calvary and to a
[51:53] Rapture notice you can't go to Calvary
[51:55] without first going
[51:57] you can't go to a Rapture without first
[51:58] going through Calvary not just the
[52:00] mechanics but it must be the Dynamics
[52:02] the prophet would say we've got the
[52:04] mechanics we love the mechanics and we
[52:05] do we know the mechanics we know how to
[52:07] shout we know how to praise we know how
[52:09] to dance we know how to sing right we
[52:10] know how to pray right we know how to do
[52:12] all these things we know how to listen
[52:13] to tape we know how to press play we
[52:15] know how to how to back the preacher we
[52:17] know how to do all these things but I'm
[52:18] here to tell you this evening church
[52:20] press and play won't take it to a
[52:21] Rapture listening to tapes ain't going
[52:22] to take it to a Rapture just reading
[52:24] your Bible ain't going to take it to a
[52:25] Rapture going through the some some 10
[52:27] set plan is not going to take it to a
[52:28] Rapture but brother Brandon would tell
[52:30] the church we love the mechanics we know
[52:32] the mechanics but that's not what we are
[52:33] looking for but what we are looking for
[52:35] is to see the spirit of Christ to get
[52:37] into the church to get into the body
[52:39] until it drives the mechanics in your
[52:41] life brother Brandon would say I would
[52:42] rather see a man that was right in his
[52:44] spirit and wrong in his Doctrine than to
[52:45] see a man that was wrong in his right in
[52:48] his Doctrine and wrong in his spirit
[52:50] because he recognized that you could
[52:51] have all the right Doctrine you could
[52:53] have all the knowledge you could have
[52:54] all the wisdom you could have all the
[52:55] mechanics you could go to Seminary you
[52:57] could go to school you could get an
[52:59] education oh but Doctrine won't drive
[53:01] you to a Rapture knowledge is not going
[53:02] to drive you to a Rapture wisdom won't
[53:04] drive you to a Rapture all these things
[53:06] will not drive you to a Rapture but
[53:07] there is a force that is Dr that is
[53:09] inside the Bride of Jesus Christ that
[53:11] will drive this body into a Rapture
[53:13] there was a dynamic Force church that
[53:15] was placed inside of a seed before the
[53:17] foundation of the world and when that
[53:18] lie struck that seed it begin to sprout
[53:21] forth and brother Brenham said that
[53:22] Dynamic power will be what drives you to
[53:25] Calvary it won't be some 10-step plan it
[53:27] won't be just listening to a preacher it
[53:29] won't be just coming to church two or
[53:30] three times a week it won't just be
[53:32] listening to a tape every day but until
[53:34] you get the dynamic power inside of you
[53:36] driving the mechanics in your life that
[53:38] is what's going to drive you to a
[53:40] Rapture that is what drives this bride
[53:42] body oh church I don't believe we're
[53:43] just a mechanical machine I don't
[53:45] believe we just go through the motions
[53:46] every Sunday morning and and Sunday
[53:48] night and or Wednesday night or Thursday
[53:50] night but the Dynamics are moving in the
[53:52] Church of the Living God it's driving us
[53:53] to a Rapture it's driving us to a deeper
[53:55] revelation is driving us to a deeper
[53:57] relationship is driving us to a body
[53:59] change there is a power that is moving
[54:01] in this building and that power church
[54:03] is not just some work up it's not just
[54:05] some emotional buildup it's not just
[54:07] something that we like to feel that we
[54:08] just like to see oh but is a dynamic
[54:10] power it's greater than any devil it's
[54:12] greater than any sickness it's greater
[54:14] than any complex it's greater than any
[54:16] trial that you're ever going to go
[54:17] through it's greater than any battle
[54:18] you're ever going to face there is a
[54:20] dynamic power that completely overcomes
[54:22] any power Satan has it completely
[54:24] overcomes any Authority Satan has over
[54:26] your life because when that Dynamic
[54:28] power comes into the Bride of Jesus
[54:30] Christ it gives you the same Authority
[54:32] that the groom has whenever the dynamic
[54:34] power that was in the groom is placed in
[54:36] the bride you can walk where the groom
[54:38] walks you can step where the groom steps
[54:40] you can speak what the groom speaks you
[54:41] can do what the groom does why because
[54:43] the same power that the groom has is now
[54:46] moving inside of you amen do you believe
[54:48] that tonight I believe that we are
[54:50] living in a time today where is of the
[54:52] utmost importance that we recognize the
[54:54] age that we are living in brother would
[54:56] preach a sermon called recognizing your
[54:58] day in this message and if you listen to
[55:00] this message it's amazing to me how the
[55:02] prophet would he would literally beg and
[55:04] plead with the people to recognize that
[55:06] you're living in the last
[55:08] days and in one place he would say
[55:10] people recognize the age that you're in
[55:12] look at what's happened look at what's
[55:13] promised recognize the day that you're
[55:15] living in the prophet was so emphasized
[55:18] and so uh see he was he was so strain on
[55:20] the importance of recognizing that
[55:21] you're living in the last days because
[55:23] we know that God would always move more
[55:25] in the last days than any other time
[55:27] just looking at the life of Jesus God
[55:29] would move more in the last days of his
[55:31] life than at any other time and if you
[55:33] begin to listen to this sermon the
[55:35] prophet he will go through and he will
[55:36] show us how that every time every time
[55:38] we move from one age to another age God
[55:41] always sends a message that is Anointed
[55:43] and elect for that God's predestinated
[55:45] in that age God sends a messenger with a
[55:47] message throughout every single age and
[55:49] he would take an entire service on
[55:50] urging us to recognize the day that
[55:52] we're in because the prophet knew he
[55:54] said that you could see the message
[55:56] message you could know the message you
[55:57] could recognize the message sent by the
[55:59] angel messenger but unless you recognize
[56:02] that that message will not just sent
[56:03] from any group of people that message
[56:05] was not just sent for any church it was
[56:06] not just sent for any group it was not
[56:08] just sent for any age but you must
[56:10] recognize that this message has been
[56:11] sent for you as the Bride of Jesus
[56:13] Christ in the day that you were living
[56:14] in this message would not a work for
[56:16] Luther's day it would not a work for
[56:17] Wesley's day it would not a work for
[56:19] Paul's day why because it was not given
[56:21] for their day it was not given for
[56:23] Paul's day it was not given for Wesley's
[56:24] day but as word this message has been
[56:27] given for your day for your time it has
[56:29] been given for you to manifest it's been
[56:31] given for you to express for you to
[56:32] bring forth this Dynamics has been given
[56:35] for you oh it's I I believe it's time
[56:37] this message has been given the word has
[56:39] been revealed the word has been fully
[56:41] revealed and it's your day to manifest
[56:43] it it's your time to manifest it we
[56:44] recognize who we are we recognize our
[56:47] commission we recognize our message and
[56:49] I believe that this this with this even
[56:50] that this BR can recognize who we are
[56:53] and what the power we have because we
[56:54] have watched as this message has
[56:56] fulfilled everything it promised it
[56:58] would do this message brother Braham did
[57:00] not leave one loose Corner brother Bram
[57:02] did not leave one loose thread he did
[57:03] not leave one question unanswered but
[57:05] this message has done everything it
[57:07] promised it would do we have seen the
[57:09] outpouring of the Holy Spirit we have
[57:11] seen the outpouring of the Dynamics we
[57:12] have seen the Dynamics come to life we
[57:14] have watched the chains of fear fall off
[57:16] we have watched the shackles of unbelief
[57:18] fall off of the Bride of Jesus Christ we
[57:20] ain't just mechanics we ain't just going
[57:21] through the motions we ain't just
[57:23] following after a tradition but the
[57:24] Dynamics is alive in the Church of the
[57:26] Living God we have seen him move in
[57:28] power we have seen him move in Authority
[57:30] we have seen him move in healing move in
[57:32] Deliverance and I believe it's moving
[57:33] through this church it's moving proving
[57:35] who we are vindicating who we are just
[57:38] as much as the pillar of fire Vindicated
[57:40] who brother brandham was it also
[57:42] Vindicated who you were because it
[57:44] showed that there was a prophet that was
[57:46] s for a group of people and there was a
[57:48] dynamic power that was following that
[57:50] Prophet that was going to be transferred
[57:52] into the bride body of Jesus Christ amen
[57:54] I believe it's moving through this
[57:55] church we know who we are and this is
[57:57] our day to manifest the word it's our
[58:00] day to manifest his message it isn't
[58:02] somebody else's day it's your day oh
[58:04] come on somebody Joshua had his day
[58:06] Moses had his day Paul had his day
[58:09] brother Brenham has his day but I
[58:10] declare to you tonight this is not their
[58:12] day this is not their time this is not
[58:15] their season but this is your day that
[58:17] God has poured out his Spirit Upon A
[58:19] group of people a people that will
[58:21] believe it a people that will manifest
[58:23] it a people that will hear it and that
[58:25] they will believe it and man manest it
[58:27] oh hallelujah it's your day
[58:30] tonight it's your time it's your season
[58:33] it was not given for somebody else you
[58:34] must recognize that this message was
[58:36] given for you it was given this Dynamic
[58:39] power was given for you if you look at
[58:41] the definition of mechanics versus
[58:44] Dynamics the answer according to physics
[58:46] it's actually it's it's a physics thing
[58:48] and it's very simple there are many
[58:50] there like several complicated essays
[58:52] and articles online if you go to looking
[58:53] where people they try to break it down
[58:55] but the is actually very simple I was
[58:57] able to just find an actual like a
[58:58] college just a physics textbook and it
[59:01] just explained the answer very simply
[59:04] mechanics is a study of
[59:06] motion Dynamics is a study of motion and
[59:09] force together or the effect that a
[59:11] force has on the motion of an object so
[59:14] the mechanics is simply when a body
[59:16] moves is in motion you understand that
[59:18] it moves you know that it moves you know
[59:20] the Motions is supposed to go through oh
[59:22] but the dynamic says in order for that
[59:23] object to move the way that it's
[59:25] supposed to move there must be a force
[59:28] that moved upon that body that made it
[59:29] move there must be a force that is
[59:31] greater than that object that made it
[59:33] move oh church you can sit there and you
[59:35] can go through the motions all you want
[59:36] to you can go to church twice a week you
[59:38] can pay your ti you can give your
[59:40] offerings you can you can listen to your
[59:41] Tes but until you get a revelation that
[59:44] there is a force that is greater than
[59:45] you that's greater than your
[59:46] achievements that's greater than your
[59:48] than your accomplishments that's greater
[59:50] than your battle greater than your enemy
[59:52] until you get that Revelation all you're
[59:53] doing is going through the motions oh
[59:55] but if you can just surrender to the
[59:57] spirit of God if you can just surrender
[59:59] over to the force that's moving through
[1:00:00] your life that spirit will begin to move
[1:00:03] there will be a power move through your
[1:00:04] life until you don't control your tongue
[1:00:06] you don't control your mind you don't
[1:00:08] control your thoughts you don't control
[1:00:10] your hands you don't control your feet
[1:00:12] oh but there is a force that's begin to
[1:00:13] move inside of you and you are no longer
[1:00:15] fighting a battle but now there is a
[1:00:17] force that is grating that that is
[1:00:19] fighting that battle for you oh church
[1:00:21] I'm here to tell you that Dynamic force
[1:00:23] is greater than any devil it's got more
[1:00:25] Force than any enemy it's got more Force
[1:00:27] than any power it's got more Force than
[1:00:29] any complex it's got more Force than any
[1:00:32] depression it's got more Force than any
[1:00:33] pornography I'm here to tell you tonight
[1:00:35] Church there was a dynamic force that
[1:00:38] comes with the message of the hour it's
[1:00:40] for the body of Jesus Christ it wasn't
[1:00:42] for the Pentecostals it wasn't for the
[1:00:44] Baptist he would have given it to them
[1:00:46] if it was but he didn't give it to them
[1:00:48] he gave it to you he gave this power to
[1:00:50] you he gave the Dynamics to you and he
[1:00:53] said you manifest it you speak with
[1:00:55] authority you speak with power you bring
[1:00:58] it forth because I've given you this
[1:01:00] message oh Hallelujah you got to
[1:01:03] surrender to that Force brother bandam
[1:01:06] said complete and total surrender not
[1:01:09] partial surrender not say well Lord I'll
[1:01:11] give you my heart on Sunday and I'll
[1:01:12] give you my heart on Wednesday or
[1:01:14] Thursday oh but every day Lord oh I
[1:01:16] Surrender my life completely to you in
[1:01:19] order for that Dynamics to move you got
[1:01:20] to stop trying to move the mechanics
[1:01:22] yourself if you're sitting there trying
[1:01:24] to push a car that car ain't going to
[1:01:26] move if you're sitting there you can run
[1:01:27] you can bump up against it you can do
[1:01:29] everything you want to but if there
[1:01:30] ain't no gasoline in it if there ain't
[1:01:32] no spark that lights it up and moves it
[1:01:34] oh you're wasting your time sitting
[1:01:35] there try to push that car you you can
[1:01:37] sit there and you can push that gas
[1:01:38] pedal all day long and I believe it's
[1:01:40] sometimes church we got so many people
[1:01:42] that they sit in the church and they're
[1:01:43] sitting there and they're stepping on
[1:01:44] the gas pedal they're sitting there
[1:01:46] they're trying to go back but there
[1:01:47] ain't no gas in the tank there ain't no
[1:01:49] spark that's lighing the car and they
[1:01:51] ain't moving anywhere why because
[1:01:52] they're trying to move the mechanics
[1:01:54] yourself and church I'm here to tell I
[1:01:56] know I know I I've listened to anointed
[1:01:58] ones at the end time I know there are
[1:01:59] people that come to church and they're
[1:02:01] going to spend their lives in church
[1:02:02] they're going to dance they're going to
[1:02:03] shout along with you and they're not
[1:02:05] going to be the elect they're not going
[1:02:06] to have this Dynamic power but the
[1:02:08] difference between you and them is that
[1:02:10] they move the mechanics in their life oh
[1:02:12] but you have another Force that's moving
[1:02:14] the dynamic the mechanics in your life
[1:02:16] and that is a dynamic power oh that they
[1:02:19] could never have that's a dynamic force
[1:02:21] that they can never have oh Hallelujah
[1:02:23] whenever you begin to get that power you
[1:02:26] speak the word you ain't got to have
[1:02:27] some preacher do it you ain't got to
[1:02:29] have the pastor do it you ain't got to
[1:02:31] call call up your grandma or call up
[1:02:33] your grandpa have them do it for you you
[1:02:34] a got to call up Mom and Dad but Church
[1:02:36] you even you young people you can speak
[1:02:38] the word you speak the power the
[1:02:40] Dynamics in you brother bandam didn't
[1:02:43] say the power of God is the Dynamics in
[1:02:45] me he didn't say the power of God is the
[1:02:48] Dynamics in William bandam he said the
[1:02:50] Dynamics in you is the power of God I
[1:02:53] say you speak the word you speak healing
[1:02:56] you speak overcoming you move the power
[1:02:58] of God oh you speak it you speak it
[1:03:01] church I'm siing tired of this mindset
[1:03:03] this power was just for brother brandham
[1:03:05] oh this all was just for brother Bram no
[1:03:07] it wasn't for brother brandham it was
[1:03:08] for you it was for you to manifest it
[1:03:11] was for you to believe it was for you to
[1:03:13] hack B it was for you to speak oh
[1:03:16] Hallelujah it was for
[1:03:18] you Amen brother Braham said Satan has
[1:03:22] all the mechanics in the world that's a
[1:03:24] direct quote he has all the mechanics in
[1:03:27] the world you can't beat him with
[1:03:28] mechanics if you look at a boxer ring I
[1:03:30] was going through and looking at
[1:03:31] Muhammad Ali when he fought big George
[1:03:33] Forman in the way that he did it he
[1:03:37] recognized that he could not fight him
[1:03:38] with
[1:03:40] mechanics he could not defeat that guy
[1:03:42] with mechanics he cannot defeat him by
[1:03:44] going through the motions like he
[1:03:45] normally did he cannot defeat him just
[1:03:47] by running around the wing ring and just
[1:03:49] by just by doing the right punches and
[1:03:51] doing the Right Moves he couldn't do it
[1:03:53] why because George Foreman had more
[1:03:54] mechanics than he had he had more power
[1:03:56] than he had so what he have to do he had
[1:03:59] to get a find a greater power and he
[1:04:00] began to work on his mind he began to
[1:04:02] work on his mind and so many times
[1:04:04] That's what Satan does to us he begins
[1:04:05] to work on her mind he begins to work on
[1:04:07] her mind why because he knows that he
[1:04:08] doesn't have the power that you have he
[1:04:10] knows he doesn't have the authority that
[1:04:12] you have in one place brother Brandon
[1:04:13] would say the only Power Satan has over
[1:04:16] you is is a bluff the only def the only
[1:04:19] weapon Satan has against you is to
[1:04:21] convince you that you ain't got the
[1:04:22] power to defea him brother B said that's
[1:04:24] the only Power Satan has over you oh but
[1:04:26] if you could just recognize tonight
[1:04:27] church that there is a dynamic power oh
[1:04:30] that is alive and moving inside of you
[1:04:32] it isn't just the church this isn't a
[1:04:34] dead church this isn't a dead body this
[1:04:36] isn't going to be a dead bride oh but
[1:04:38] this is a Living Church this is a living
[1:04:41] bride this is a bride that is dressed
[1:04:42] and ready to meet our groom a bride that
[1:04:44] is moving with the dynamic power of the
[1:04:46] Holy Ghost we're filled with the Holy
[1:04:48] Ghost we're filled with the Holy Spirit
[1:04:50] and we're moving with that
[1:04:52] power oh Hallelujah brother Brandon he
[1:04:55] would be begin the rising of the sun he
[1:04:57] would go back to the first time that the
[1:04:59] spirit of God ever moved upon the Earth
[1:05:02] and he would show us in just the first
[1:05:03] few paragraphs how at the first time the
[1:05:05] spirit ever spoke it brought forth light
[1:05:08] he would say that the first time that
[1:05:10] the spirit in the word the spirit and
[1:05:11] the spoken word ever came together and
[1:05:13] formed one and and joined in Union he
[1:05:15] said the result was
[1:05:17] Lot he would say there was a time when
[1:05:19] the world was laying in utter Darkness
[1:05:21] it was without form and it was void and
[1:05:23] it was covered with water and there was
[1:05:25] laying in that dark dismal gloomy
[1:05:27] atmosphere and the spirit of God moved
[1:05:29] upon that water and said let there be
[1:05:31] light see God had a reason to do that
[1:05:33] for down beneath that water there was
[1:05:35] seeds that he had planted and it had to
[1:05:38] have that sunlight to make it live he
[1:05:41] would say the sun rose and swept across
[1:05:42] its rays and it dried up the waters from
[1:05:44] the earth and it made an atmosphere
[1:05:46] above and for the first time it was to
[1:05:48] bring joy and life to the Earth by a
[1:05:51] seed that was a great hour I mean the
[1:05:53] first time the spirit ever spoke life
[1:05:55] came forth that light was the evidence
[1:05:58] that the spirit has been moving oh when
[1:06:00] I say there was a light that has been
[1:06:01] placed inside this church and it is
[1:06:03] evidence is evidence that the spirit is
[1:06:05] moving and not only did that Spirit
[1:06:06] bring light but the prophet said that
[1:06:08] that light that came by the spirit
[1:06:10] created an atmosphere to light for life
[1:06:12] to exist where it could not exist before
[1:06:14] that light that Spirit brought light and
[1:06:17] that light brought life life is
[1:06:19] essential to light light excuse me light
[1:06:22] is essential to life brother Brandon he
[1:06:24] would tell us in one point without light
[1:06:26] nothing can live without light there is
[1:06:28] nothing upon the Earth but what has to
[1:06:29] come by the Light of the Sun in another
[1:06:32] place wheat is sold in the ground but
[1:06:33] when that sun gets just right it's got
[1:06:35] to live see it can't live without the
[1:06:37] sun light is crucial and vital in order
[1:06:40] for life to exist now if you actually
[1:06:43] look at how the sun produces light most
[1:06:45] of you probably know you learn about it
[1:06:46] in school it's in the textbooks but it's
[1:06:48] a process called nuclear fusion and
[1:06:50] basically the sun is made up of billions
[1:06:53] and trillions of hydrogen atoms and and
[1:06:55] these all these hydrogen atoms they're
[1:06:57] at the core of the Sun and they're
[1:06:58] moving so fast they're they begin to
[1:07:01] move and they're picking up speed and
[1:07:02] they're moving so fast and what happens
[1:07:04] is that they move so fast that whenever
[1:07:05] they bump into each other because of the
[1:07:08] great speed that they're moving at they
[1:07:09] don't bounce off but they actually fuse
[1:07:11] together and it create it it requires
[1:07:14] such a great force that takes these
[1:07:16] hydrogen atoms and to move them at a
[1:07:17] speed to where it will fuse them
[1:07:18] together and in order to produce that
[1:07:21] life there must be a fourth that is
[1:07:22] strong enough to take these two separate
[1:07:24] particles and to combine them into one
[1:07:26] oh brother Brandon would say what makes
[1:07:28] the Dynamics live was the spirit and the
[1:07:30] word came together to form one and when
[1:07:32] that force it sends those particles
[1:07:34] together they fuse into each other and I
[1:07:36] loved how it said when I was reading it
[1:07:38] that they become no longer two hydrogen
[1:07:40] atoms there was no longer any trace of
[1:07:43] hydrogen in the final product but when
[1:07:45] they come and they fuse together it
[1:07:47] under goes a complete and total
[1:07:48] transformation process and becomes an
[1:07:51] entirely new particle a particle of
[1:07:53] light
[1:07:55] oh Hallelujah there was a force that
[1:07:57] moved Upon Your Life Church from before
[1:07:58] the foundation of the world it took the
[1:08:00] spirit and it took the word and it took
[1:08:02] and it pushed them together and it
[1:08:04] combine them together and fuse them
[1:08:06] together on the inside of you in order
[1:08:08] to produce a light a light that is
[1:08:10] unlike anything the world has ever seen
[1:08:12] you were once a carnal being born and
[1:08:14] shaped in iniquity you were born into
[1:08:16] this world speaking lies oh but there
[1:08:18] was a light that shine upon your life
[1:08:20] from before the foundation of the world
[1:08:22] the spirit and the word came together
[1:08:24] inside of her body body and It produced
[1:08:27] the light and that light was not just
[1:08:28] going to be any light oh but that light
[1:08:31] was going to be the very force that
[1:08:32] brought that seed of life on the inside
[1:08:34] of you oh Hallelujah Church we're living
[1:08:37] in a dark World we're living in the
[1:08:39] darkest airs the world has ever seen oh
[1:08:41] but as long as this bride is still
[1:08:43] standing there will still be a light
[1:08:45] that is shining in the darkest night
[1:08:47] there will sh still be a light that is
[1:08:48] shining forth there will still be a
[1:08:50] pillar of fire there will still be a
[1:08:52] power that is coming forth oh as long as
[1:08:55] we have the Dynamics there is still a
[1:08:57] light that is lighting the way oh we
[1:08:59] still have a power lighting the way for
[1:09:01] us brother Brandon would say today if
[1:09:04] that light of God that Holy Spirit ever
[1:09:06] strikes a predestinated seed whose name
[1:09:08] was put on the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:09:10] before the foundation of the world the
[1:09:12] Bible says that that's right the light
[1:09:14] will shine not the Light May shine not
[1:09:17] the light might Shine the Light will
[1:09:19] shine he said you can preach to some and
[1:09:22] it seems like it's just water on a
[1:09:23] duck's back and it just Falls right off
[1:09:25] oh but let that seed one strike and
[1:09:28] Watch What Happens quickly something is
[1:09:31] there right now it's a predestinated
[1:09:33] seed it's got to come and when that life
[1:09:36] strikes it they get it oh come on church
[1:09:39] can I get a witness tonight that will
[1:09:40] say I got it when that lie struck The
[1:09:43] Siege on the inside of my heart I got it
[1:09:45] I didn't wonder who Malachi 4 was I
[1:09:48] didn't wonder what this message was I
[1:09:50] wasn't confused on the godhead I wasn't
[1:09:52] confused on adoption I wasn't confused
[1:09:54] on bri Authority
[1:09:55] oh when thy life struck thy seed all of
[1:09:58] a sudden a force came inside my life and
[1:10:01] I got it I got the Revelation oh what
[1:10:04] once was something I just heard the
[1:10:05] preacher told what once was just a story
[1:10:08] but once was just something coming out
[1:10:09] of the preacher's mouth all of a sudden
[1:10:12] became a living reality oh I had heard
[1:10:15] he was a way maker I heard he was a
[1:10:17] promisee keeper I heard he was a savior
[1:10:19] I heard he was a Healer I heard he was
[1:10:21] peace in the storm I heard he was
[1:10:23] calming the midst of Chaos oh but all of
[1:10:26] a sudden that life struck the seed and
[1:10:28] what once was just something I had heard
[1:10:31] all of a sudden struck my heart and
[1:10:34] became a living reality oh I know he's a
[1:10:37] way maker I know he's a promis keeper I
[1:10:40] know he's peace in the storm I know he's
[1:10:42] calming the midst of chaos I know he's
[1:10:44] the lad of the world why because that Li
[1:10:46] struck the seed and I began to manifest
[1:10:49] the Dynamics of the word oh I'm no
[1:10:52] longer confused church this bride ain't
[1:10:54] going through an identity crisis we
[1:10:56] ain't confused on who we are we know who
[1:10:58] we are we know the power we have brother
[1:11:01] bam said when the bride of Christ knows
[1:11:03] who she is and what she stands for and
[1:11:05] that she can do the Greater Works he
[1:11:07] says she will be an invincible Army and
[1:11:10] Satan will stand powerless before her oh
[1:11:13] Satan was saying powerless before you he
[1:11:15] says powerless before you T not if you
[1:11:17] know who you are if you know the power
[1:11:20] that you hold if you know that you are
[1:11:22] the Bride of Jesus Christ and that there
[1:11:24] is a dynamic force that was selected and
[1:11:27] ordained and predestinated for you not
[1:11:29] for any other group not for any other
[1:11:31] denominational power but th Dynamics was
[1:11:33] made for you to overcome in this evil
[1:11:36] age oh when you do that Satan is
[1:11:38] powerless before you brother B said
[1:11:40] there is nothing he can throw at you oh
[1:11:43] it'll just bounce off of you and fly
[1:11:45] back to him I say there is nothing when
[1:11:47] you've got this Dynamic power oh that
[1:11:49] Satan has over
[1:11:51] you oh Hallelujah that nuclear fusion it
[1:11:55] produces those particles of light it
[1:11:57] takes place at the very center of the
[1:11:58] sun Now it only takes about 8 and a half
[1:12:01] minutes for that light to go from the
[1:12:03] surface of the Sun where is from the
[1:12:05] surface of the Sun to reach you to where
[1:12:07] where it is at Earth it only takes about
[1:12:09] eight and a half minutes but I was doing
[1:12:11] this research and that light is not
[1:12:12] produced at the surface of the sun it's
[1:12:15] produced at the core of the Sun and that
[1:12:17] light that every single particle little
[1:12:19] bitty Photon particle of life that is
[1:12:21] ever produced in the sun has to fight
[1:12:23] through 432 th000 miles of hydrogen
[1:12:27] atoms before it breaks through the
[1:12:28] surface of the Sun and this process
[1:12:30] takes well over a 100,000 years well
[1:12:33] over a 100,000 years for a single
[1:12:35] particle of lot to go from the center of
[1:12:37] the Sun to reach you at to be manifested
[1:12:39] to where you are at oh I begin to think
[1:12:41] about that oh I begin to look at that
[1:12:43] and I started getting excited why
[1:12:45] because I begin to think well over a
[1:12:47] 100,000 years so when I get up in the
[1:12:49] morning that life that's shining through
[1:12:51] my window that life that shines upon me
[1:12:53] that life that manifested upon me it
[1:12:55] wasn't made last year it wasn't made
[1:12:58] last week it wasn't made last month it
[1:12:59] wasn't made when I gave my heart to the
[1:13:01] Lord that light shining on me it wasn't
[1:13:03] made when I got the baptism of the Holy
[1:13:05] Ghost it wasn't made when I was born it
[1:13:07] wasn't made when I came to the message
[1:13:09] Oh but before the foundation of the
[1:13:11] world that was a life was produced it
[1:13:13] wasn't made in 1965 it wasn't made in
[1:13:16] Paul's day it wasn't made in Joshua's
[1:13:18] day it wasn't made in Moses day Oh but
[1:13:21] before the foundation of the world there
[1:13:23] was a life that came forth there Spirit
[1:13:25] and the word came together and formed a
[1:13:28] lot on the inside of you oh Church it
[1:13:30] might have taken thousands and thousands
[1:13:32] of years to reach you oh but you were in
[1:13:35] the might of God from before the
[1:13:36] foundation of the world and there was a
[1:13:38] lot that was placed on the inside of you
[1:13:41] oh why because he knew oh I'm going to
[1:13:43] have a bride in the last days that's
[1:13:45] going to be living in a dark world
[1:13:47] they're going to be living in a dark
[1:13:49] time oh but they are going to need a lot
[1:13:51] they are going to need a dynamic Force
[1:13:54] so I'm going to play on the inside of
[1:13:56] them oh Hallelujah that light wasn't
[1:13:59] made last week it wasn't made when you
[1:14:01] got saved it wasn't made when you came
[1:14:03] to the altar that might have been when
[1:14:05] the sea begin to sprout forth oh but
[1:14:07] that light was made before the
[1:14:08] foundation of the world oh Hallelujah
[1:14:11] young people how does Satan try to
[1:14:12] attack you I tell you how San tries to
[1:14:14] attack you today he tries to take you
[1:14:15] back to when he gave your heart to the
[1:14:17] Lord he tried to take you back oh you
[1:14:19] didn't really do it right you weren't
[1:14:21] really sincere you didn't go through all
[1:14:23] the steps you didn't do the right plan
[1:14:24] you didn't do anything right that you
[1:14:26] didn't really give your heart to the
[1:14:27] Lord he tries to take you back to when
[1:14:28] you got the Holy Ghost you weren't
[1:14:30] really sincere you didn't do it right it
[1:14:32] was just an emotional work up it was
[1:14:34] just some emotional buildup you just did
[1:14:36] to please Mom and Daddy you just did to
[1:14:37] do this and do that he tries to take you
[1:14:39] back to when you came to the message and
[1:14:41] tries to tell you it was just for some
[1:14:42] preacher you just heard some preacher
[1:14:44] and it sounded good and so you go to
[1:14:46] that church that ain't really the bride
[1:14:48] Authority that ain't really how adoption
[1:14:50] works that ain't really how that works
[1:14:52] that ain't really the power you have
[1:14:54] that's the way sat to get that light out
[1:14:56] of you oh and I want to make a
[1:14:57] declaration to that devil tonight I say
[1:15:00] in order for you to get that light out
[1:15:02] of a briad body in order for you to get
[1:15:04] that light out of me you would have to
[1:15:06] go back to before you were even created
[1:15:10] I say Satan would have to go back Church
[1:15:12] to before he was created because before
[1:15:14] he was there that light was there before
[1:15:17] the Devils were there that light was
[1:15:19] there before this world was there there
[1:15:22] was a light that was shining and there
[1:15:24] was plac in the bride body of Jesus
[1:15:26] Christ and that light is now shining
[1:15:28] upon you oh Satan has no authority over
[1:15:31] you if the if you were existed before he
[1:15:33] did oh I say Satan has no power over you
[1:15:36] he has no power over that loud why he
[1:15:38] wasn't there when it was made oh
[1:15:40] Hallelujah he can't get that power out
[1:15:42] of you he wasn't there when it was
[1:15:44] placed on the inside of you he didn't
[1:15:46] even exist yet I see how can Satan take
[1:15:48] something out of you that he wasn't even
[1:15:50] alive to see that he wasn't even alive
[1:15:53] there oh Church there was a Dynamic
[1:15:55] power that's been placed in the body of
[1:15:57] Jesus Christ and I say Satan has no
[1:16:00] power over you he stands powerless
[1:16:02] before you pornography is Raging
[1:16:04] complexes are raging depression is
[1:16:06] Raging in our young people like never
[1:16:08] before Oh will I say get that out of

[1:16:17] push the depression out it'll push the
[1:16:20] complexes out it'll push the pornography

[1:16:44] going to take you part of the way church
[1:16:46] it's not a dynamic power that's going to
[1:16:47] take you a few steps it's going to take
[1:16:49] you to a certain point it's not going to
[1:16:51] take you to a certain place oh with this

[1:17:08] oh
[1:17:11] Hallelujah Ephesians 6:12 it was say for
[1:17:14] we wrestle not against flesh and blood
[1:17:17] but against principalities against
[1:17:18] Powers rulers of Darkness of this world
[1:17:21] against spiritual wickedness in high
[1:17:22] places wherefore takeen you the whole
[1:17:25] armor of God the be able to withstand in
[1:17:27] the evil day and having done all to
[1:17:30] stand stand therefore having your loins
[1:17:32] G about I'm sorry having your LS G about
[1:17:35] with truth and having on the breastplate
[1:17:37] of righteousness and your feet sha with
[1:17:39] the with the preparation of the gospel
[1:17:41] of peace above all taking the shield of
[1:17:43] Faith wherewith you shall be able to
[1:17:45] quench all the fiery darts of the wicked
[1:17:47] and take the Helen of Salvation And The
[1:17:49] Sword of the spirit which is the word of
[1:17:51] God the sword of spirit which is the
[1:17:53] word of God the prophet would say the
[1:17:55] Dynamics of this church will be a
[1:17:57] refilling of the Holy Spirit the
[1:18:00] Dynamics in the church is the refilling
[1:18:02] of the holy spirit so we recognize from
[1:18:04] the scriptures that we're reading that
[1:18:06] this time that we're living in we're
[1:18:07] living in a time of War we're not living
[1:18:09] in a time of peace I hate to break it to
[1:18:11] you the modern conventional ideology of
[1:18:13] Christianity is that you give your heart
[1:18:15] to Jesus and you never got to fight
[1:18:16] again you give your heart to the Lord
[1:18:18] and you put your name in the church book
[1:18:19] and you never got to fight you never got
[1:18:20] to battle you never got to wrestle again
[1:18:22] you're good but that ain't that ain't
[1:18:24] true that's a of the devil brother bam
[1:18:25] said that we are warriors and he said
[1:18:27] that we will fight for every in of
[1:18:29] ground that we possess and as Warriors a
[1:18:31] warrior has got to have a
[1:18:33] weapon and that weapon that was going to
[1:18:35] be given to us by God would be the sword
[1:18:37] of the spirit the Holy Spirit which is
[1:18:39] the Dynamics the prophet would say I
[1:18:41] would live in one place he would say
[1:18:42] that on the day of Pentecost God
[1:18:44] equipped every man in the upper room
[1:18:46] with a weapon and that weapon was the
[1:18:48] Holy Spirit the Dynamics of the word is
[1:18:50] the very weapon that has been placed
[1:18:52] into the hands of the Bride of Jesus
[1:18:54] Christ to overcome the Ws of the enemy
[1:18:56] to over to overcome principalities to
[1:18:59] overcome the rules of Darkness Church
[1:19:01] we've got the king's weapon tonight we
[1:19:03] are not fighting with some Broken Sword
[1:19:05] we're not fighting with some brown sword
[1:19:06] we're not fighting with some weapon that
[1:19:08] might break or that we don't know will
[1:19:10] hold up but you are fighting with the
[1:19:11] king's weapon the same weapon The Same
[1:19:14] Spirit that Rose Christ from the dead
[1:19:15] that conquered Hell In The Grave that
[1:19:17] triumphed over Darkness the Triant over
[1:19:19] Satan that Quicken your mortal bodies is
[1:19:21] the same weapon now that's been placed
[1:19:23] into your hands
[1:19:25] brother Brandon would tell the story of
[1:19:27] David Livingstone the missionary in
[1:19:29] Africa and he would tell the story about
[1:19:31] how that he was led of God to witness to
[1:19:33] this tribe these tribes in Africa and he
[1:19:36] uh these tribes he he built a
[1:19:38] relationship with the King and he went
[1:19:40] through the tribal rituals and
[1:19:42] everything because all these tribes this
[1:19:43] nation there had all bunch of tribes
[1:19:45] within these nations and brother
[1:19:47] brandham would say he said they were
[1:19:48] Wicked they were they were very very
[1:19:50] just he said you would simply try to
[1:19:53] walk up to the village and they would
[1:19:54] just Slaughter you you like he said they
[1:19:56] they were constantly war with each other
[1:19:57] wor with everybody he said there was no
[1:19:59] getting to these people so he was able
[1:20:01] to go to the king of this nation and was
[1:20:03] able to build a relationship with this
[1:20:05] King and brother Brandon would talk
[1:20:06] about how he went through a tribal
[1:20:08] ritual and became Blood Brothers with
[1:20:09] him where they like you know they both
[1:20:12] cut their hand and they they they mixed
[1:20:14] the blood together and they they did
[1:20:15] that and they became blood blood
[1:20:17] brothers and it was a custom of that
[1:20:19] nation that when you become blood
[1:20:20] brothers that had to be in
[1:20:22] exchange and brother Bon would say the
[1:20:24] king would look at David Livingstone he
[1:20:26] would say I want the cat off of your
[1:20:27] back and I love this story because we
[1:20:29] know that a coat represents
[1:20:30] identification and so David Livingstone
[1:20:32] he took it off and he gave it to him and
[1:20:34] he said I want your spear that you carry
[1:20:36] he said I want the king's Spear and
[1:20:38] brother brandham would say that spear
[1:20:39] was a sacred weapon it was the king
[1:20:41] spirit and no matter how much the tribes
[1:20:44] would fight no matter how much the
[1:20:45] tribes they would clear kill and they
[1:20:47] would Slaughter each other they all knew
[1:20:49] the king's spear so David Livingstone he
[1:20:52] made the trade he gave the king his cult
[1:20:54] or he gave him his identity and in
[1:20:55] return the king gave him the king's
[1:20:57] weapon the king's Sword and the story
[1:21:00] goes that he went he witnessed Jesus
[1:21:01] Christ to all those tribes brother
[1:21:03] brandham would say because every time
[1:21:05] that he would come close to one of these
[1:21:07] tribes brother bam say he will go and he
[1:21:09] would travel and he will walk up to one
[1:21:10] of those tribes and he said they will
[1:21:12] come forth with their weapons the enemy
[1:21:13] will come out to killing and he said all
[1:21:15] he had to do oh was take the king's
[1:21:17] weapon and just raise it up he said all
[1:21:19] he had to do was raise the king's weapon
[1:21:21] he said those enemies would stop in
[1:21:22] their tracks they would drop their
[1:21:24] weapons and they'll back up why because
[1:21:26] brother Brenham said that they knew the
[1:21:28] king's weapon and they knew that if any
[1:21:30] man was carrying the king's weapon that
[1:21:32] meant I've got a message from the King
[1:21:35] and that there's nothing that you can do
[1:21:36] to hurt me I say tonight see y'all
[1:21:39] excuse me I've been finding this
[1:21:41] sickness I say now we've got the king's
[1:21:44] weapon we've got the power of God this
[1:21:46] king's weapon has been placed into our
[1:21:48] hands and every time he will go to that
[1:21:50] tribe they had no choice but to drop
[1:21:52] their weapon because once they saw the
[1:21:55] king's weapon they knew they were
[1:21:57] defeated they knew that they were over
[1:21:59] they knew that their time was done why
[1:22:01] because the king's weapon represented
[1:22:03] something I say you've been given a
[1:22:05] weapon tonight you've been given the
[1:22:07] king's weapon and it's not just any
[1:22:09] weapon it's not just any sword it's not
[1:22:12] just something that looks good oh but it
[1:22:14] is a weapon that has Authority it's a
[1:22:16] weapon that has power it is the word and
[1:22:19] the Dynamics of that word that's making
[1:22:22] it live oh I say we've got the King's
[1:22:24] weapon ton not oh we ain't walking
[1:22:26] around we ain't walking around with
[1:22:28] little slingshots we ain't walking
[1:22:30] around just with BB guns we ain't
[1:22:32] walking around just wondering if we're
[1:22:33] going to win oh but a weapon has been
[1:22:36] placed into your hands that is going to
[1:22:37] carry you all the way oh but my Propet
[1:22:40] stood in Sabino Canyon oh and that sword
[1:22:42] began to come from the sky and the
[1:22:44] prophet said he took a hold of that
[1:22:46] sword oh and what did this what did that
[1:22:48] voice say he didn't say it was a king
[1:22:50] sword that voice said it was the king
[1:22:52] sword the king's weapon was was placed
[1:22:54] into the hands of the Prophet messenger
[1:22:57] oh Hallelujah church and that weapon has
[1:22:59] now been given to the Bride of Jesus
[1:23:02] Christ I say we've got the king's weapon
[1:23:05] oh the Pentecostals think they've got it
[1:23:07] the Baptist think they've got it the
[1:23:09] denominations think they've got it oh
[1:23:12] but as my Prophet took a hold of that
[1:23:13] sword oh he didn't take it and look down
[1:23:15] at it and say oh my this fits Billy
[1:23:18] Graham's hand perfectly oh he didn't
[1:23:21] take that sword and go oh this fits oral
[1:23:23] Robert's hand perfectly
[1:23:25] oh no but that King's sword came and
[1:23:27] rested into the prophet's hands and he
[1:23:29] said that sword fit my hand perfectly
[1:23:33] the sword was made to fit the prophet's
[1:23:35] hand it was made for his hand oh church
[1:23:38] it was made to be brought this message
[1:23:40] was made to be brought forth by Malachi
[1:23:43] 4 it was made to be brought forth by
[1:23:45] William brandham and now this message
[1:23:47] this word this Dynamic weapon has been
[1:23:50] placed into your hands oh Hallelujah it
[1:23:54] it wasn't for them it's for you you have
[1:23:57] Dynamic Authority you have Dynamic power
[1:24:00] oh Hallelujah you've got the king's
[1:24:03] weapon
[1:24:05] amen hallelujah Romans 8:11 it would say
[1:24:09] but if the spirit of him that raised up
[1:24:11] Jesus from the dead dwells in you he
[1:24:13] that raised up Christ from the dead
[1:24:14] shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by
[1:24:16] his spirit that dwells in you brother
[1:24:18] bam would say when you get the Dynamics
[1:24:20] you have been quickened from Mortal to
[1:24:22] immortality it makes the the whole body
[1:24:25] comes subject to the word it makes the
[1:24:27] whole body come subject to the word not
[1:24:29] part of the body oh but every aspect of
[1:24:31] your being is now subject to a higher
[1:24:33] power it'll make you act different look
[1:24:36] different live different it'll just make
[1:24:38] you different on down he said you need
[1:24:40] to close yourself in the upper room till
[1:24:42] the Dynamics come that's right it
[1:24:44] changed them it quickened them it made
[1:24:47] them different they were a changed
[1:24:49] people from then on it quickened them
[1:24:51] from an old life of being a coward to
[1:24:53] like the Lion of the tribe of Judah oh I
[1:24:56] like that it instilled a boldness on the
[1:24:58] inside of them he said it made them from
[1:25:00] being a coward to the lion of the tribe
[1:25:02] of Judah they absolutely faced martyrdom
[1:25:05] nailed to the crosses crucified upside
[1:25:07] down burnt throw it in the Lion's Den No
[1:25:09] More cowards about them death had no
[1:25:11] victory over them at all that wouldn't
[1:25:13] mean they didn't die that wouldn't mean
[1:25:15] that they wouldn't have to go and that
[1:25:17] they wouldn't be Marty that they
[1:25:18] wouldn't face death oh but he said death
[1:25:20] had no victory over them at all the
[1:25:23] Dynamics was in the mechanics and they
[1:25:25] Quicken their mortal body oh Hallelujah
[1:25:28] we see brother bandam going through this
[1:25:29] upper Rim experience and he would draw
[1:25:31] us to recognize that when the dynamic
[1:25:33] comes it completely annihilates any fear
[1:25:37] that was in your old life he would say
[1:25:39] in that portion again it Quicken them
[1:25:40] from a life of being a coward to like
[1:25:43] the lion of the tribe of Judah they
[1:25:45] absolutely face mome nailed to crosses
[1:25:47] crucified burnt thr in lines in no more
[1:25:50] cowards about
[1:25:52] them death had no victory over them at
[1:25:55] all death had no victory over them the
[1:25:58] lion Zen had no victory over them the
[1:25:59] fire furnace had no Victory oh the the
[1:26:02] fear had no Victory unbelief had no
[1:26:04] Victory why because when you were born
[1:26:06] you were born with a life that Satan can
[1:26:08] control you were born with a life where

[1:28:09] own now this is deep now and be sure to
[1:28:11] catch this as the sun was sent across
[1:28:14] the Earth not to bring rocks which was
[1:28:16] which was dirt also to life it was not
[1:28:19] meant to bring all the dirt to life but
[1:28:21] it was meant to bring a part of that
[1:28:22] dirt which was enclosed around Al life
[1:28:25] oh not all men will receive Christ no
[1:28:28] but those which God for ordained for
[1:28:30] life is housed around some of the dirt
[1:28:32] of the earth and that is the one that he
[1:28:34] has come to Quicken oh they're the ones
[1:28:38] he said now that dirt will lay there in
[1:28:39] the Sun and would say oh this sun is so
[1:28:41] hot that rock would say this sun's so
[1:28:44] hot oh but that little seed said that's
[1:28:46] what I'm looking for oh that's what
[1:28:48] we're looking for tonight that light to
[1:28:50] come forth brother BR said it was the
[1:28:51] same light that shined on the Rock the
[1:28:53] same light that shine on the dirt oh but
[1:28:55] when it hit the seed that's what I'm
[1:28:57] looking for and it begin to sprout forth
[1:29:00] to life it quickened that part of the
[1:29:02] dirt because the sun was sent not to
[1:29:04] Quicken The Rock not to Quicken the dirt
[1:29:06] but to Quicken the life of the seed oh
[1:29:09] quit listening to what The Rock has to
[1:29:10] say quit listening to what the dirt has
[1:29:12] to say the light was not sent for them
[1:29:15] this Dynamics was not sent for them but
[1:29:17] it was sent for you this power was sent
[1:29:19] for you to express this word was sent
[1:29:21] for you to express for you to manifest
[1:29:23] the last was sent to Quicken your body
[1:29:25] to Quicken your soul amen as they come
[1:29:28] to the music
[1:29:30] tonight I'll leave you with this brother
[1:29:32] Bron would say that's what he proved
[1:29:33] Hallelujah that's what Easter proved he
[1:29:36] wasn't only the word but he was God
[1:29:38] himself the Dynamics in the word that
[1:29:41] made the body of Jesus CHR Christ cold
[1:29:44] stiff and dead in the grave Shake into
[1:29:46] life and rise again and roll away the
[1:29:48] stone he said I am he that was dead I
[1:29:51] love this so dead till the son said he
[1:29:53] was dead the moon said he was dead the
[1:29:55] Stars said he was dead all nature said
[1:29:57] he was dead can we all agree that sounds
[1:29:59] pretty dead he said oh but now the whole
[1:30:02] world has to recognize that he's alive
[1:30:04] again he's not only the mechanics God's
[1:30:06] word but he was the Dynamics to prove
[1:30:10] it now Jesus now now brother bandam he
[1:30:13] just went through and he just told you
[1:30:14] who Jesus was he just explained to you
[1:30:17] who he was he was the Dynamics the word
[1:30:19] and the spirit together and now he will
[1:30:22] continue in the next paragraph
[1:30:24] and now as he being the groom a PR has
[1:30:27] to come forth because it's a part of him
[1:30:31] see he had a reason for explaining who
[1:30:32] Jesus was he had a reason for explaining
[1:30:35] who God was why because he would now go
[1:30:37] on to explain the bride and the bride
[1:30:40] was a lot easier to explain you know why
[1:30:42] because he had already explained who the
[1:30:43] groom was and it's the same person he
[1:30:46] would say it's a part of him hold now it
[1:30:49] can only manifest if it does something
[1:30:52] different from the groom it isn't the
[1:30:54] bride she is flesh of his flesh bone of
[1:30:57] his bone life of his life power of his
[1:30:59] power she is

[1:31:26] every battle oh if he overcame it you
[1:31:28] overcome it why you're him he overcame
[1:31:31] lust of the flesh why why will you
[1:31:33] overcome you are him he overcame
[1:31:35] Temptations and you will too why you are
[1:31:37] him the same Dynamic power that made him
[1:31:41] who he was is inside this bride making
