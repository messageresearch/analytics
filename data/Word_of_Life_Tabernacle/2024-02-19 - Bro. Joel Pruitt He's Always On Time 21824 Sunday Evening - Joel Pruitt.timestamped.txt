[47:23] always on time how about you and so I
[47:26] was reading this here and and and you
[47:29] know they receive the news of of Lazarus
[47:31] Jesus receives the news of Lazarus dying
[47:34] and and uh he he you know it's his
[47:37] friend and he uh and he couldn't go you
[47:39] know he moved in he was moving in with
[47:41] uh Mary Martha and Lazarus he went to
[47:43] live with him brother bandam said and
[47:44] and then the ministry had called him
[47:45] away and then he received word that that
[47:48] Lazarus was sick and and so he he goes
[47:52] he he wants to go to his friend but he
[47:53] can't go just right away and and and
[47:55] then when he finally gets there she
[47:57] saidwell Lord if you had been here he
[47:59] wouldn't have been dead you know why cuz
[48:00] where Jesus is death has no rights but
[48:03] but Jesus wasn't there and so he dies
[48:06] and he said I'm glad for your sakes that
[48:09] I wasn't here and it looks like it was a
[48:12] real dark time don't you think so
[48:14] because you know you would think if he
[48:15] was sick well sure he can get healed but
[48:18] now he's dead and now he's not just dead
[48:20] one days two days three days but no he's
[48:22] dead brother R said corruption has set
[48:24] in his nose is already s in it's a bad
[48:27] situation I would say that it might be
[48:29] worse than about any situation you've
[48:31] been in before but when Jesus showed up
[48:34] he proved that there was a resurrection
[48:35] power in him can you say Amen so Jesus
[48:39] gets there and and and and he and he as
[48:42] a friend brother Bram said he would weep
[48:43] like a man he would grieve for his
[48:45] friend but when he gets to the grave of
[48:47] Lazarus he shows up and says he he says
[48:50] he says Lazarus come forth and the body
[48:52] that was ate up with skin worms had to
[48:54] had to had to come to life why because
[48:57] death knew its Master death couldn't
[48:59] hold him no longer why because God had
[49:01] spoke and when God speaks anything you
[49:04] can rest your soul on it that it will
[49:06] take place God cannot the the word can't
[49:10] lie and if he could do it for Lazarus he
[49:12] could do it for anybody but you'll see
[49:15] that Jesus he he goes on down here and
[49:17] he says uh he let me get on back to my
[49:20] place here he said he said when he went
[49:22] down he said he went to wake him he said
[49:23] they took Lazarus out and he had an
[49:25] embal they had embalmed his body I mean
[49:27] when you say when it's embalmed it's too
[49:29] far gone wouldn't you say so and just
[49:31] too far gone brother Joe he' agree with
[49:33] that if the if the body's in bombed we
[49:35] probably ain't going down to lay hands
[49:36] on them but but this one here was a
[49:39] different case why because Jesus was
[49:41] there and the point I want to drive home
[49:43] today is Jesus is still here well
[49:46] Jesus's body may not be but it is his
[49:48] hands are yours his feet are yours his
[49:50] voice is yours Jesus is still here and
[49:54] he's he's talking about the skin worms
[49:56] developed he said all hopes was gone it
[49:57] was The Darkest Hour the little family
[49:59] had ever seen he said did you ever hit
[50:01] that hour somebody's been there today
[50:03] somebody's been in a bad situation
[50:05] somebody's been so far gone they didn't
[50:07] think they'd ever come back but Jesus
[50:09] came along and when Jesus shows up I
[50:12] don't care how dark it is he is the
[50:14] light of the
[50:15] world all hopes was gone he said I've
[50:19] hit that in our home loved ones be taken
[50:21] away in darkness Darkest Hour of the
[50:22] little family had ever seen and then
[50:24] Jesus come along he usually comes when
[50:27] it's the darkest hour can you say Amen
[50:29] to that brother B said I remember the
[50:31] darkest hour I ever seen when I was
[50:32] laying Yonder and May's brother's
[50:33] hospital he said the doctors looked at
[50:35] me and said there's not an Earthly
[50:36] chance for you to ever be well he said
[50:38] two years ago said you broke yourself
[50:40] and your whole nervous system is is is
[50:42] gone he said you can't keep nothing on
[50:43] your stomach you never will said you're
[50:45] finished for life and he said there was
[50:47] tears rolling down down my cheeks
[50:48] knowing that my life was ending like
[50:50] that and he said I looked up and said
[50:52] father and about that time Jesus come
[50:54] along how many's ever felt that that
[50:55] before he said Jesus come along and he
[50:58] said well my he comes right at the
[50:59] darkest of ours he said it was the
[51:01] darkest of ours that the woman with the
[51:02] blood issue had ever seen she had spent
[51:04] all of her money and then Jesus come
[51:06] along well there is a great physician
[51:09] you can spend money at Mayo Clinic you
[51:10] can spend Mayo at the local hospital or
[51:12] doctor and God uses them but when it's
[51:15] too far gone for the doctor Jesus can
[51:17] show up amen well can you say amen he
[51:21] said and he said there was another set
[51:23] he said The Darkest Hour was meach
[51:24] Shadrach isach and Abednego he said it
[51:26] was The Darkest Hour they'd ever seen
[51:28] they were literally put into the fire
[51:30] that's a pretty dark hour they were
[51:32] literally in the fire but then a fourth
[51:33] man came along he said that was like un
[51:35] to the Son of God I believe that when
[51:38] Jesus shows up you say what my
[51:39] Situation's out of control Just Let
[51:42] Jesus show up one time why do we need
[51:44] him in our services why do we need him
[51:46] in our homes why do we need him when
[51:47] we're driving down the road because the
[51:49] darkest hour could be just like that but
[51:51] you need Jesus in the
[51:53] room if there's whatever a Time the
[51:56] world needed Jesus it's now when gross
[51:59] darkness is on the earth and and there's
[52:01] a time of insanity all around us and it
[52:03] looks like people are just falling
[52:05] farther and farther from truth I believe
[52:07] there's a little group of people have
[52:08] come in contact with Jesus you say well
[52:11] where is Jesus today well that's what
[52:13] I'd like to tell you now Jesus is his
[52:15] word Christ is his word in the beginning
[52:17] was the word the word was with God the
[52:19] Word was God and then it was made flesh
[52:21] and dwelt among us and then when he went
[52:23] away he sent his Spirit back on the
[52:25] church church and that's what we have
[52:26] today and brother BR said the mechanics
[52:28] and Dynamics were here he said the
[52:30] mechanics the word and the spirit are
[52:32] here we don't have to wait on something
[52:34] to come it is
[52:37] here that's why we don't have to be
[52:39] scared in the darkest hour we don't have
[52:41] to go around and and feel like we're in
[52:43] a graveyard in the dark you know what it
[52:45] is it we don't have to be that way we
[52:47] don't have to wonder when Jesus is
[52:49] coming we we know he's coming and we're
[52:52] just going to live like he's coming
[52:53] every day let's not be scared about it
[52:55] let's let's just live like he's coming
[52:56] today let's live like he's coming
[52:58] tomorrow when you wake up I know he's
[53:00] coming I want to just walk as close as I
[53:02] can to the way he said it in his word oh
[53:05] yeah he said there was another Dark Hour
[53:07] he said he said uh he said when Jesus
[53:09] come along gyrus had a had a daughter
[53:11] she was 12 years old and she was already
[53:13] dead and then Jesus come along he said
[53:16] it was the darkest to Old blind barus
[53:18] had ever seen down there then Jesus come
[53:20] along he's always there at the darkest
[53:22] of hours I would like to tell you he's
[53:24] always always on time it looks like he's
[53:27] late it looks like there's no hope but
[53:30] Jesus is on time he's never missed an
[53:32] appointment brother random said he's
[53:33] never been late to an appointment he's
[53:35] always showed up just when he knows he's
[53:38] got to show up it looks like Jesus
[53:41] didn't come when he was told to by his
[53:43] friends well we wish you to come when we
[53:46] called you because then you you could
[53:47] have saved our brother we wish You' have
[53:50] showed up just before the situation got
[53:52] this bad but now I know there's no hope
[53:56] but just when your situation looks like
[53:58] it's too far gone that's when he shows
[54:00] up when you can't do it on your own and
[54:02] you need help the helper shows up well
[54:05] come on somebody has anybody ever been
[54:07] in a struggle before has anybody ever
[54:09] been in a valley so deep you can't see
[54:11] the mountain tops no more has anybody
[54:13] ever felt like you just want to give up
[54:16] God will show up in those times when it
[54:19] looks like you backsliding so far that
[54:21] that there's no way back and you've done
[54:23] things that you just can't you can't be
[54:25] forgiven of there is a way back repent
[54:28] and come back to God and he's always
[54:30] there to meet
[54:32] you the prodigal son comes home and he
[54:34] didn't have to come home and say you
[54:36] know I I'm one of your sons I I've been
[54:39] out there in the pig pin I've been
[54:40] pretty bad off but don't you remember me
[54:43] no the father was waiting he was already
[54:45] ready and waiting because it was a bad
[54:47] time and he knew that son could only go
[54:50] so far before he had to come home he
[54:52] knew he could only well you can't last
[54:54] too long out there he knew the funds
[54:56] would run out eventually and so when
[54:58] your money's run out and when your time
[55:00] looks like it's about to be cut short
[55:02] because you're maybe you're out of the
[55:03] will of God or you're doing things you
[55:05] shouldn't do I I know there's a way back
[55:08] why because I've experienced the way
[55:10] back and I know some people sitting here
[55:12] today have experienced a way back you
[55:14] you've gotten away from God at times but
[55:17] you found a way home again and that's
[55:19] what I want to encourage you today that
[55:21] when your darkest time comes Jesus will
[55:24] come on the scene and Jesus will show up
[55:26] not when you want him but when he knows
[55:28] he's got to be there because he's not
[55:30] going to lose you he's not going to lose
[55:32] your children why because he's always on
[55:35] time we don't have to worry about is he
[55:39] going to come when we want him did you
[55:41] invite him to the service this evening
[55:42] then he's here but if you've got a
[55:45] situation that you can't handle I know
[55:47] somebody who can when you can't handle
[55:50] it anymore that's the perfect time for
[55:52] him to show up if you can handle it you
[55:54] don't need him but when The Sinner when
[55:56] the world was so lost that there was no
[55:58] way back the Lambs wasn't going to work
[56:00] no more the goats wouldn't work no more
[56:02] there was no no kind of thing that would
[56:04] work anymore but then God had to send
[56:07] his son in the darkest time the world
[56:09] had ever seen and then there was another
[56:11] time the darkest world the darkest time
[56:13] the world had ever seen we were in an
[56:15] age and and it was almost complete
[56:16] darkness over the church and there was
[56:18] no more spirit in the church and then
[56:20] and guess what God sent a light in this
[56:22] age he sent a messenger just when it
[56:24] looked like there was nobody left to
[56:26] believe it and there had to be raised up
[56:28] somebody in this age why because there
[56:30] was a promise of a Rapture and there had
[56:32] to be somebody to believe it somebody
[56:34] that could live it somebody that could
[56:35] take the word in his fullness and make
[56:38] Jesus Christ Al
[56:40] again you can't you can't say we're
[56:42] we're just put here by chance no God had
[56:45] us here at a specific time and a
[56:47] specific purpose for a for a reason and
[56:50] the reason we're here is because
[56:52] somebody had to be a light in a dark
[56:54] time
[56:55] Jesus had to show up on time oh yeah the
[56:59] message had to come when it did on time
[57:03] it couldn't have come earlier and it
[57:04] couldn't have come later it came exactly
[57:06] when God wanted it that should give us
[57:08] hope of a Rapture and a future because
[57:11] the messenger comes right before all
[57:13] that takes place you say well we might
[57:14] have another seven Church ages no the
[57:16] final Church age has come and I believe
[57:19] we're now in the bright age to where all
[57:21] things are coming together for a Rapture
[57:24] oh thank you Lord brother B talks about
[57:26] here he
[57:27] said he said when Jesus had died the
[57:29] people were in a a state they didn't
[57:31] know what to do he had already told them
[57:33] what was fixing to happen but they
[57:35] didn't know why because a lot of times
[57:37] we hear the word but we don't don't
[57:40] apply it to the situation we're in
[57:42] because it just looks too bad he said
[57:44] there was a couple of name of Copus and
[57:46] so forth they was on the road to EMAs
[57:48] yeah they were going along sadhe hearted
[57:50] broken they were going along talking
[57:52] about oh how bad it was and all of a
[57:54] sudden someone stepped out of the bushes
[57:56] an ordinary man not with any with his
[57:58] collar turned around or any different
[58:00] dressing he dressed like the rest of the
[58:02] man he wore his hair and his beard just
[58:04] like the rest of them did he wasn't any
[58:06] different he didn't make any great
[58:08] different in his life didn't have Pro
[58:10] didn't have a didn't prove his
[58:12] credentials he said he wore his hair and
[58:14] his beard just like the rest of them did
[58:16] and he said he wasn't any different he
[58:18] didn't make any great difference there
[58:19] he said he he said what he did he said
[58:21] and that's what God wants us to be is
[58:23] wants our life to be our credentials
[58:24] that's right and he said when he began
[58:26] to walk along he said Brethren why are
[58:28] you so sad why why are you having this
[58:30] conversation he said oh I just love that
[58:32] he said there he said why why are you
[58:34] around here and they said why are you a
[58:35] stranger hanging around here he wasn't
[58:38] even recognized among them and he said
[58:41] oh I just love that he said well he he
[58:43] said he said the whole country is tore
[58:44] up and and said we're on a road going
[58:46] back home he said Jesus of Nazareth the
[58:48] prophet we thought surely he would when
[58:50] he come he would be the king of Israel
[58:52] and now he's dead and and they buried
[58:54] him and they they pierced him in the
[58:55] heart and they put him away and said
[58:57] even this the even this is the third day
[58:59] since it all happened and and he was put
[59:01] to death and said some women was down at
[59:02] the grave and seen a vision of angels
[59:04] and come back and and said he was alive
[59:07] I I I heard that and I thought well a
[59:09] lot of people say well a prophet thought
[59:10] he went behind the curtain of time and
[59:12] thought he saw this and thought he saw
[59:13] that they questioned it they doubt it
[59:15] really happened but we know it did
[59:17] happen and here he is standing there
[59:19] listening to their complaints about how
[59:21] bad it was because we've lost Jesus
[59:24] can't hear no more and he's standing
[59:26] there in the
[59:28] flesh he said now look how beautifully
[59:30] he said look at this Christ amongst the
[59:32] sad and brokenhearted that's where he
[59:34] comes and he said that's where he goes
[59:36] the sad and the Brokenhearted they were
[59:37] going along in the darkest tower that
[59:39] they ever ever had seen all their hopes
[59:41] was gone they' been put out of the
[59:43] church the synagogues because they
[59:44] believed on him and he said uh and who
[59:46] they had trusted was dead and some some
[59:48] women had come around a little story
[59:50] about some visions and they had seen
[59:51] some angels and tell his disciples that
[59:52] he would meet them in Galilee but he
[59:54] said oh they couldn't believe that they
[59:55] were brokenhearted and and sad and and
[59:58] crying and the lovely Jesus appears to
[1:00:00] the Brokenhearted and then he had to
[1:00:02] tell them oh fools and slow of heart to
[1:00:05] believe all that the prophets have
[1:00:06] spoken don't you see that the scriptures
[1:00:08] are being revealed in front of
[1:00:10] you I wonder if I could ask you today do
[1:00:13] you see the scriptures being revealed
[1:00:15] right in front of you you don't have to
[1:00:17] be sad no more you don't have to worry
[1:00:20] no more because Christ has come back
[1:00:22] Among Us he oh come on Church he is
[1:00:25] living now among his people in the flesh
[1:00:28] again it's your flesh and my flesh where
[1:00:30] Christ is living now we don't have to
[1:00:32] worry no more there's no reason to be
[1:00:34] sad no more why because Jesus has
[1:00:37] appeared just on
[1:00:40] time there's another situation I'm going
[1:00:43] to hurry tonight I promise I won't hold
[1:00:44] you long brother Bill told me he said
[1:00:46] you can preach as long as you want to
[1:00:48] but when you see me walk out it's been
[1:00:49] too
[1:00:51] long I'm watching you buddy you leave
[1:00:54] leave I'm stopping First Kings 17 goes
[1:00:57] like this verse 10 1 Kings 17:10 said
[1:01:02] Elijah he arose and went down to zerath
[1:01:04] and when he came to the gate of the city
[1:01:05] there was a widow was gathering sticks
[1:01:07] and he called her and said fetch me I
[1:01:10] pray the a little water in a vessel that
[1:01:12] I may drink and I'd like you to notice
[1:01:13] the spirit of Elijah there and the
[1:01:15] spirit of Elijah on our Elijah who would
[1:01:17] go down by the spirit of the Lord and
[1:01:19] would see a little woman at the gate oh
[1:01:21] come on somebody if you can't see what
[1:01:23] we've got in this hour then I don't know
[1:01:24] what to tell you but if there is a
[1:01:26] calling on the inside of you to know
[1:01:28] that this message is correct when the
[1:01:30] word struck your heart nobody can talk
[1:01:32] you out of it and and and I'm telling
[1:01:35] you this woman here had went through
[1:01:37] hardship her food was about gone and he
[1:01:40] goes down verse 12 there if you can and
[1:01:42] she said as the Lord thy God liveth I
[1:01:44] have not a cake but I have a handful of
[1:01:46] meal and a barrel and an oil and a
[1:01:47] cruise and behold I'm gathering two
[1:01:49] sticks that I may go in and dress it for
[1:01:51] me and my son we're going to eat it
[1:01:53] we're going to die come on now there's
[1:01:54] no more hope it's all over we're going
[1:01:57] to eat our spirit our our natural food
[1:01:59] and we're gone and here's the prophet
[1:02:02] who was told to go down there and ask
[1:02:03] for food and he goes and ask for it and
[1:02:06] Elijah said unto her fear not yes fear
[1:02:09] not because he said he said go and do as
[1:02:13] thou Hast said but make me thereof a
[1:02:15] little cake first and bring it unto me
[1:02:17] and after make for thee and for thy son
[1:02:20] now I want you to notice here she could
[1:02:22] have went and done what was best for her
[1:02:24] come on come on somebody she could have
[1:02:27] went and did exactly what would save her
[1:02:29] son and her for another day or two but
[1:02:32] what she needed to do was obey the word
[1:02:34] of the Lord by the prophet of God she
[1:02:37] had never met the man maybe maybe she
[1:02:39] never saw a miracle done by this man but
[1:02:41] he could stand there and tell her
[1:02:42] something and something on the inside of
[1:02:44] this woman decided it was better to
[1:02:48] obey and she went and did according to
[1:02:50] the saying of Elijah and she and he and
[1:02:52] her house did eat many
[1:02:54] days God can take a a situation that
[1:02:58] looks like there's not a bit of food
[1:02:59] left in your I tell you what there's not
[1:03:01] a dollar left in your bank account
[1:03:03] there's no food in the cupboard anymore
[1:03:05] but God has not is not going to let you
[1:03:07] sit there and starve being in the will
[1:03:10] of
[1:03:11] God he his children don't beg for bread
[1:03:14] his seed don't beg for bread you you
[1:03:16] don't have to worry about it give it to
[1:03:19] Jesus he said and it came to pass after
[1:03:21] these things he said that the son of the
[1:03:23] woman fell sick and his sickness was so
[1:03:26] sore that there was no breath left in
[1:03:27] him so now she'd already been through
[1:03:28] one
[1:03:29] situation and she had watched God move
[1:03:31] in one situation and now here comes
[1:03:34] another one now he was he survived I
[1:03:37] listened to the word of the Lord and I
[1:03:38] made it through a trial and here's
[1:03:40] another trial and and and so they get
[1:03:42] into the other trial and and now her
[1:03:44] son's dead first it was just about to be
[1:03:46] starvation now he's gone now what's she
[1:03:49] going to do she's got to believe the
[1:03:51] same word by the same source and and
[1:03:54] that's the only way we can do today
[1:03:55] Church you may get in a bad situation
[1:03:58] but if he brought you this far he can
[1:04:00] bring you through a worse trial and
[1:04:02] he'll bring you out on the other side
[1:04:03] every time and so he gets there and
[1:04:06] Elijah said what have I to do with thee
[1:04:08] Oh or she said what unto Elijah what
[1:04:10] have I to do with thee oh man of God Art
[1:04:12] Thou come unto me to call my sin to
[1:04:14] remembrance and to slay my son and he
[1:04:15] said unto her give me thy son and he
[1:04:18] took him out of her bosom now I want to
[1:04:19] go back verse 18 I want you to notice
[1:04:22] it's not always your sin that's making
[1:04:24] you go through a trial are you going to
[1:04:27] tell me about my sin and how bad I've
[1:04:28] been no that's not what he was coming to
[1:04:30] do just give me the child give me your
[1:04:32] situation quit looking back at your past
[1:04:35] look to God and give him your
[1:04:39] troubles and she said unto Elijah what
[1:04:41] have I to do with thee and he goes on in
[1:04:42] verse 19 and he said unto her give me
[1:04:44] thy son and he took him out of her bosom
[1:04:46] and carried him up into a loft where he
[1:04:47] Abode and laid him upon his own bed and
[1:04:50] he cried unto the Lord and said oh Lord
[1:04:52] my God hast thou all also brought evil
[1:04:54] upon the Widow with whom I sojourned by
[1:04:56] slaying her son and he stretched himself
[1:04:59] unto the child three times and cried to
[1:05:00] the Lord and said oh Lord my God I pray
[1:05:02] thee let this child's Soul come into
[1:05:04] again and the Lord heard the voice of
[1:05:06] Elijah and the soul of the child came
[1:05:08] into him again and he revived it's a bad
[1:05:11] situation but God showed up right it's a
[1:05:14] situation I would say none of us have
[1:05:16] been in but God showed up I I don't want
[1:05:19] you to look at your situation tonight
[1:05:21] because you've never been in a situation
[1:05:23] like that you've never well come on
[1:05:24] somebody if your children are still
[1:05:26] living they've still got a chance to
[1:05:27] walk in them doors right now and come
[1:05:29] back to the Lord if it looks like you
[1:05:31] can't get over this struggle in your
[1:05:32] life if you're still sitting here in
[1:05:34] church and there's a possibility of an
[1:05:36] overcoming
[1:05:37] life when you're gone you say well how
[1:05:39] do you get save then well I I I listen
[1:05:42] Church don't ever give up
[1:05:44] hope this son was dead and he still come
[1:05:46] back Lazarus was dead he still come back
[1:05:49] I I don't care what's happened I don't
[1:05:51] care how bad it's been just call Jesus
[1:05:54] on the scene he will show up right on
[1:05:57] time sir verse 24 and the woman sent
[1:06:01] Elijah now by this I know that thou art
[1:06:03] a man of God and that the word of the
[1:06:04] Lord is in my m in thy mouth is truth
[1:06:06] all that other time she had to take him
[1:06:08] at his word without even knowing it was
[1:06:10] true you didn't know this message was
[1:06:12] true when you first heard it but
[1:06:14] something in you said I better listen to
[1:06:16] that and time after time you've overcome
[1:06:18] something why because the message is not
[1:06:21] a fairy tale it is not a lie it is not
[1:06:24] for 1947 or 1965 it is for today it is
[1:06:28] for you and me just the same as it was
[1:06:31] for a Prophet this message did not die
[1:06:33] in 1965 and it is not coming up again
[1:06:36] right before the Rapture the message is
[1:06:38] here and it is alive right
[1:06:40] now brother R talks about the woman in
[1:06:42] Memphis and he said he was going along
[1:06:43] down there and his plane had got stalled
[1:06:45] you realize your bad situation could be
[1:06:48] God working on both ends and God had
[1:06:50] stopped him there at the plane in
[1:06:52] Memphis and and then he has to go go
[1:06:54] down and he's he's humming and I think
[1:06:55] one of them or something like that and
[1:06:57] he's humming down and he and he's going
[1:06:58] down into the the Lord said just keep on
[1:07:01] walking and he goes into a part of
[1:07:02] Memphis and I've been told it's where
[1:07:03] the Bass Pro pyramid sits now in that
[1:07:05] part of Memphis but I don't know that to
[1:07:06] be facts but I'm sure the people that
[1:07:08] like Bass Pro would like that to be true
[1:07:10] and he's going down there and and he and
[1:07:12] he and and he and he finds this little
[1:07:14] house and he sees this woman laying out
[1:07:17] and this woman knew who was coming
[1:07:18] before he come so now God had stopped
[1:07:21] the plane and now here's a prophet
[1:07:22] walking down the road and sees he said a
[1:07:24] typical antama woman standing out there
[1:07:27] and he said she's leaning over the gate
[1:07:28] and said good morning Parson why because
[1:07:30] she knew he was coming do you realize
[1:07:32] that God can speak to you and your
[1:07:34] situation
[1:07:36] personally you I need a word from the
[1:07:38] Lord he can speak to you personally he
[1:07:40] told a woman who may have never been in
[1:07:42] church to look for a man wearing a
[1:07:44] certain color hat do you realize God can
[1:07:47] speak to you like that God knows your
[1:07:50] situation and he's not going to leave
[1:07:51] you in that situation if you call on his
[1:07:54] name brother bam said he knew this woman
[1:07:56] was a prayer Warrior he goes into her
[1:07:58] house and he sees she's got a boy laying
[1:08:00] there who who was certain to death he
[1:08:02] was about to die and and and she's
[1:08:04] laying there and and it wasn't so much
[1:08:06] for his his health to come back but but
[1:08:08] but she prayed for this boy and he got
[1:08:10] out and he got in a got a bad disease
[1:08:12] and now he's going to die without the
[1:08:13] Lord she wanted him to be
[1:08:15] saved that's what we want for our
[1:08:17] children I'm not so worried about you
[1:08:19] know if they get down to where they're
[1:08:20] going to die Lord I want them back but
[1:08:22] I'm going to tell you this I want their
[1:08:24] souls to be saved more than anything and
[1:08:27] this woman she had a desire on her heart
[1:08:29] she didn't say I want him raised up so
[1:08:30] he can keep living like he's living no I
[1:08:32] want my boy to be saved I want my boy to
[1:08:35] be an overcomer and brother brandom said
[1:08:37] he let her pray and he said there's a
[1:08:39] woman who had talked to God before well
[1:08:41] I wonder sometimes if if our children
[1:08:44] ever hear us talk to God like that and
[1:08:46] that gives them a hope to say you know
[1:08:47] what Mama Prayed for me I'm in a bad
[1:08:50] situation daddy prayed for me I may be
[1:08:52] in a bad situation but there there's a
[1:08:54] prayer somewhere that touched
[1:08:57] heaven and this little woman here may
[1:08:59] may not have known much but he she said
[1:09:01] I'm like that shite woman I'm just like
[1:09:03] that where's my Elijah and God showed me
[1:09:06] that you're my Elijah and so her Elijah
[1:09:08] shows up just like the Elijah in the
[1:09:10] Bible and then this boy here was about
[1:09:12] to die and she's praying and and brother
[1:09:15] bandam said that you know he said it's
[1:09:17] getting dark it's getting darker in the
[1:09:19] room oh I'm telling you I'd like to tell
[1:09:21] you today when the darkness comes that's
[1:09:23] when Jes Jesus shows up well I don't
[1:09:27] know how else and how more plain to put
[1:09:28] it some of you are sitting there saying
[1:09:30] my Situation's too bad Let Jesus show up
[1:09:33] one time he is the light you need in
[1:09:36] your darkest
[1:09:38] to your Situation's not too bad your
[1:09:41] situation ain't even the worst one that
[1:09:43] the Bible's ever talked about you want
[1:09:45] to talk about Jonah and whales belly
[1:09:46] brother BR said symptoms he had symptoms
[1:09:49] you want to talk about a situation he
[1:09:51] was in a bad situation and and you know
[1:09:54] the cartoons when I was a kid they
[1:09:56] showed Jonah in this whales belly and it
[1:09:57] looked like a cathedral in there you had
[1:09:59] rib cages over here and rib cages in a
[1:10:02] spine have you ever cut open a fish
[1:10:06] before does it look like
[1:10:08] that I would imagine he's in there all
[1:10:10] squeezed up in the guts and the blood
[1:10:13] and whatever else that whale or fish had
[1:10:16] ate and he has to find a way to turn to
[1:10:20] where he can pray right and he gets
[1:10:22] himself just in a situation where he
[1:10:24] believes he's facing the right direction
[1:10:27] sir well come on somebody sir he
[1:10:29] believes he's facing the right direction
[1:10:32] and then he's praying
[1:10:34] Lord help your stupid servant I feel
[1:10:37] that way every time I come out to preach
[1:10:39] Lord help your stupid servant I need
[1:10:41] your help I'm not getting out of this
[1:10:43] whales belly alone well what did he do
[1:10:45] he showed up just on time and work the
[1:10:48] situation out for his good and for his
[1:10:51] glory and I want you to know tonight
[1:10:53] that every situation you've ever been in
[1:10:56] is for the good of you and God he is
[1:10:59] working your situation out on both ends
[1:11:01] he oh come on somebody he doesn't want
[1:11:03] you to be down and wear a frown when
[1:11:05] you're having a bad time he doesn't want
[1:11:07] you to get yourself in such a situation
[1:11:09] that you can't be free in church no more
[1:11:11] well I tell you this all the time I'm
[1:11:12] going to tell you again God does not
[1:11:14] want you to sit there and feel like
[1:11:16] you're in chain no more because you've
[1:11:18] already been set free come on somebody
[1:11:21] you've already been free to worship
[1:11:23] you've already been freed from the W's
[1:11:24] belly you've already been freed from
[1:11:26] Death resurrection power is in you You'
[1:11:29] just got to accept
[1:11:32] it if Lazarus would have got up and said
[1:11:34] you know what I don't feel like waking
[1:11:36] up today what a bad situation that would
[1:11:38] have
[1:11:39] been when the Lord comes by your way
[1:11:42] accept what he's offering you it may not
[1:11:44] be what you want it may not be how you
[1:11:47] want it but it will be what you need
[1:11:49] exactly on
[1:11:52] time brother R said this woman here he
[1:11:55] said she got you know he talks about
[1:11:57] that woman that and he said he met that
[1:11:59] boy a couple years later down there in
[1:12:02] Memphis a little boy come up to him and
[1:12:03] said Not only am I healed but I'm saved
[1:12:06] too see The Darkest Hour looked pretty
[1:12:08] bad for the mama she just wanted a
[1:12:10] salvation but did you see what happened
[1:12:12] he not only saves but he heals he can
[1:12:15] restore and I know he can keep you
[1:12:18] children you don't have to go out in the
[1:12:19] world and have that kind of testimony
[1:12:22] come on somebody you you don't have to
[1:12:24] go out and be like well look what I did
[1:12:26] I overcome drugs and I overcome this and
[1:12:28] I overcome that you don't have to have
[1:12:30] that testimony your testimony can be I
[1:12:33] was raised in church and I found God on
[1:12:35] the front row and I was able to go to an
[1:12:37] altar one day and God saved me and God
[1:12:40] kept me and God well come on somebody
[1:12:42] you don't have to go out of the church
[1:12:44] to have a testimony the greatest
[1:12:46] testimony when you get over there and
[1:12:48] tell your friends you're going to say
[1:12:49] you know what I live through Lea there
[1:12:52] was all kinds of of of of devils all
[1:12:54] around there was all kinds of demons
[1:12:56] trying to torment me trying to Temp me
[1:12:58] but I overcame them all why because
[1:13:00] Jesus was in my
[1:13:03] boat he he doesn't want you to worry
[1:13:07] that's the thing because he's always
[1:13:09] ready to come when the situation is
[1:13:11] completely out of your control he's got
[1:13:14] it in control you might be able to
[1:13:16] manage a situation you might be able to
[1:13:18] get yourself through a certain part of
[1:13:20] life on your own and you might be like
[1:13:21] well I can do this and I can do that on
[1:13:23] my own yeah you can do a lot on your own
[1:13:25] but there's going to come a time that
[1:13:27] you've got to have Jesus and I think you
[1:13:29] need to know what it's like to call him
[1:13:30] on the scene sometimes I think we need
[1:13:33] to I think we need to know what it's
[1:13:34] like to feel his presence again because
[1:13:36] then when his presence comes you can say
[1:13:38] Lord The Situation's gotten out of
[1:13:40] control four days ago it have been nice
[1:13:42] if you have showed up but it's too far
[1:13:44] gone now but even now speak the
[1:13:49] word even now Lazarus can come forth and
[1:13:52] if a dead man can raise after 4 days
[1:13:54] your situation is not too far
[1:13:58] gone if if God can take a little meal
[1:14:01] and a little oil and make it last days
[1:14:03] after supposed to lasted one meal then
[1:14:06] God can take care of your situation but
[1:14:09] we get too much in a hurry and we get
[1:14:11] impatient with God we start saying God I
[1:14:14] want it my way I want it now I need it
[1:14:17] right now but God says just wait it
[1:14:19] ain't over yet I'm coming but it ain't
[1:14:22] over yet wait till the story has been
[1:14:27] written wait till the story's been
[1:14:29] written wait till it's all over judge
[1:14:31] nothing before it's time just wait till
[1:14:33] the other other side of your trial and
[1:14:35] you're going to look back as a blessing
[1:14:37] to you it was a trial it looked like I
[1:14:39] couldn't make it but look I made it by
[1:14:42] the grace of God it looked like my child
[1:14:45] went too far but I made it by the grace
[1:14:47] of God why because God shows up on time
[1:14:53] Jesus keeps all his
[1:14:57] appointments Jesus never left you in a
[1:15:01] situation that he couldn't get you out
[1:15:03] of that's he left you in situations you
[1:15:05] couldn't get out of that's right that's
[1:15:08] right well I can't make it on my own no
[1:15:09] you can't make it on your own but he can
[1:15:12] well I I I just don't even know if do I
[1:15:14] even have the Holy Ghost well I tell you
[1:15:16] there's a way to get the Holy Ghost I'm
[1:15:18] glad you ask all you got to do is repent
[1:15:21] and be baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:15:22] Jesus Christ and believe for it believe
[1:15:26] for it well come on somebody just
[1:15:28] believe for it and Jesus will show up on
[1:15:31] time come on well why have I waited 20
[1:15:33] years on time he'll be there why Abraham
[1:15:36] well why have I waited on time he'll be
[1:15:39] there I heard brother I heard brother
[1:15:41] Homer say this the other day I shouldn't
[1:15:42] repeat in the bullpit probably but he
[1:15:44] said Sarah had every right to doubt he
[1:15:46] said because 10 years in Abraham come in
[1:15:48] there all dancing and happy and said how
[1:15:49] you feeling today Sarah and she said I
[1:15:51] wish you'd just go away
[1:15:56] come on you ever felt that way somebody
[1:15:58] comes into the house of God and you've
[1:16:00] had a bad day and they're shouting and
[1:16:02] dancing and you're sitting there I wish
[1:16:04] they'd sit down and shut
[1:16:06] up they need to be miserable with
[1:16:10] me come on that was free I'd heard
[1:16:14] brother Homer the other night and I've
[1:16:15] got those things running through my head
[1:16:17] right
[1:16:18] now but you know what there's a lot of
[1:16:20] Truth to that we don't always feel like
[1:16:24] the blessings of God are coming down we
[1:16:26] don't always feel like we're Children of
[1:16:28] the promise we don't always feel like a
[1:16:31] Joshua generation we don't always feel
[1:16:34] like a spotless virtuous bride of Jesus
[1:16:36] Christ we don't always feel that way
[1:16:38] because the flesh has feelings and it's
[1:16:42] not always good but there's more to it
[1:16:45] than how you feel there's more to it
[1:16:47] than the way you oh come on somebody
[1:16:49] there's more to it than just coming to
[1:16:51] church and feeling good but there is a
[1:16:53] word here that will change your
[1:16:56] situation when you come and sit in a
[1:16:58] service like this morning and the word
[1:17:01] is going forth you say well nobody run
[1:17:03] the aisles this morning let me just go
[1:17:04] ahead and tell you nobody needed to run
[1:17:06] the aisles to get a blessing this
[1:17:07] morning all you had to do is listen to
[1:17:09] the word of God when you go turn on a
[1:17:11] tape driving down the road there's a lot
[1:17:13] of times you probably ain't dancing
[1:17:15] while you're driving but did you know
[1:17:16] there could be a blessing right there
[1:17:18] that could change your Eternal
[1:17:20] destination there could be a word come
[1:17:21] off that tape that could tell you
[1:17:23] something that you've had a question
[1:17:24] about for years I I want you to hear me
[1:17:27] tonight church God doesn't come when you
[1:17:29] want him to but he is always going to be
[1:17:32] on time he doesn't come when when you
[1:17:34] say well I need a good service to feel
[1:17:36] better God knows what you need in that
[1:17:38] service and God's here to give you what
[1:17:40] you need in that
[1:17:42] service well I need a blessing today so
[1:17:44] Lord I need the song leader to be on I
[1:17:47] need the preacher to really be hyped
[1:17:50] today God will give you what you have
[1:17:52] need of he might be working patience in
[1:17:54] your
[1:17:55] life ask a preacher or a song leader how
[1:17:58] that feels when he's working on
[1:18:00] them you feel you're like what am I
[1:18:03] going to say as brother Danny's teing
[1:18:04] Lord what do you want me to
[1:18:06] say yeah I'll say it like this I think
[1:18:10] God's always going to show up when he's
[1:18:11] I I know God's always going to show up
[1:18:13] when he's needed oh yes not always when
[1:18:16] you feel like you need him Lord I just
[1:18:18] need your help he's there to help you
[1:18:21] but I'm talking about a dire situation
[1:18:23] when there's no hope there's no way out
[1:18:26] on your own I just can't go any farther
[1:18:29] right brother Bill was telling me he
[1:18:31] said I just didn't feel like you know I
[1:18:32] just can't walk hardly around Walmart no
[1:18:33] more well I'll tell you he don't he
[1:18:36] don't have to be like that God can heal
[1:18:38] him just like that but you know what in
[1:18:42] that trial God's going to make a
[1:18:44] blessing out of it one way or the other
[1:18:46] in your situation God is going to show
[1:18:49] up and do whatever he thinks is best for
[1:18:52] you right it's not always what's Best in
[1:18:55] our own minds that's right but I put
[1:18:58] this together tonight and I a couple
[1:19:00] days ago I was sitting there and I
[1:19:02] thought you know what every time I feel
[1:19:03] like I just can't do it on my own
[1:19:07] somebody's got to help
[1:19:08] me yeah and then I got to thinking about
[1:19:11] I just started going through stories in
[1:19:12] the Bible who has God helped when there
[1:19:15] seemed like there was no help left and
[1:19:17] there's a whole lot of them I've named a
[1:19:19] few of them here tonight there's Lazarus
[1:19:22] it's a pretty bad situ situation there
[1:19:23] was Jonah it's a pretty bad
[1:19:25] situation you been swallowed by a fish
[1:19:27] come back and tell me how that
[1:19:29] happened pretty bad three Hebrew
[1:19:32] children that's a really bad
[1:19:34] situation Jesus never left his children
[1:19:37] in a situation that he didn't bring him
[1:19:39] out of that's right he he won't do it
[1:19:41] for you either you think brother brandom
[1:19:43] said he's not an unjust God he is not
[1:19:45] going to do one thing for one person and
[1:19:47] another thing for somebody else well
[1:19:49] everything has fell apart in my life God
[1:19:52] will show up
[1:19:53] exactly when he's needed to show up well
[1:19:55] he didn't leave you know when they were
[1:19:57] standing there at the Red Sea I'm almost
[1:19:58] done I told Brother Bill 30 minutes I'm
[1:20:00] about seven minutes over I apologize
[1:20:02] you're doing all right thank you
[1:20:04] buddy he he said he said he would you
[1:20:07] know when they get to the they get to
[1:20:08] the Red Sea down there and the people
[1:20:10] started getting in a panic you brought
[1:20:13] us out of Egypt we saw your signs we saw
[1:20:16] what your Prophet could do and now you
[1:20:18] going to leave us out here to die no God
[1:20:21] never left his people but let him get
[1:20:23] down there and he let him see Pharaoh's
[1:20:24] Army coming he let you see something
[1:20:27] coming in your life that you couldn't
[1:20:28] control because he wanted to see if you
[1:20:31] would call out to God and these people
[1:20:32] know they were probably saying Lord help
[1:20:34] us and Moses would you please help us
[1:20:36] get us out of this situation because
[1:20:38] they're going to come and kill us but
[1:20:40] did you see God had the situation
[1:20:42] already planned out in his mind and knew
[1:20:45] exactly the way it was going to happen
[1:20:47] God knew the end from the beginning and
[1:20:49] the beginning from the end he knew all
[1:20:50] of it before it ever happened and God
[1:20:53] looked down there and knew that they
[1:20:54] could be across that Red Sea before
[1:20:56] Pharaoh's Army ever showed up oh thank
[1:20:58] you Lord how by the by the by the tender
[1:21:01] hand of Jehovah as we've heard so many
[1:21:03] times by the tender hand of God he can
[1:21:05] come to your situation and change the
[1:21:07] circumstances even here tonight we don't
[1:21:10] have to wait on a Prophet come on
[1:21:11] somebody we don't have to wait on
[1:21:13] another word from the Lord we don't have
[1:21:14] to wait on Prophecy to come forth the
[1:21:16] word has come and the word says you're
[1:21:19] an overcomer the word says you are the
[1:21:22] bride the word says that if he did it
[1:21:24] for one he can do it again and the word
[1:21:27] says he will not leave you without a
[1:21:28] comforter well come on somebody the word
[1:21:30] has already come and made himself
[1:21:32] manifest Among Us and the word is always
[1:21:36] right and the word is always on
[1:21:39] time well why wasn't the seals opened
[1:21:41] earlier well because God didn't have his
[1:21:43] man in place God didn't have it to be
[1:21:45] opened earlier God had a specific time
[1:21:47] and a specific place and he's got a time
[1:21:49] and place for you he's got a time and I
[1:21:52] tell you well why was I in this church
[1:21:54] why was I in that church I don't know
[1:21:55] myself but God knew why I was there
[1:21:58] there might have been some rough edges
[1:21:59] he needed to get off of you he needed to
[1:22:02] change your thinking about some things
[1:22:04] he maybe he wanted to ground you in a
[1:22:05] certain way well do you realize that
[1:22:07] everything that's happening is for your
[1:22:11] good everything the bad stuff is for
[1:22:15] your
[1:22:16] good sir if you're a child of God well
[1:22:20] I'm not a child of God well if you're
[1:22:21] not a child of God then I guess why are
[1:22:23] you here but see I don't even believe
[1:22:25] that why would you sit on a 3:00 service
[1:22:27] if you're
[1:22:28] not come on why would you come out here
[1:22:31] and hear me if you wasn't a child of
[1:22:33] God I
[1:22:35] wouldn't I may not even if I was even if
[1:22:38] I am though I
[1:22:40] am you realize that God wanted you here
[1:22:44] for a
[1:22:45] purpose amen come I don't know why you
[1:22:49] know sometimes we say things and we're
[1:22:50] like well who is it for what's it for
[1:22:52] for I don't know your situation I don't
[1:22:54] need to know your situation but I do
[1:22:56] know when the Lord gives you something
[1:22:58] you got to preach it when the Lord tells
[1:23:00] you say something it might change
[1:23:02] somebody's Eternal destination it might
[1:23:05] change somebody's way I'll tell you what
[1:23:07] there's been people that may have been
[1:23:08] sitting in the audience and thought
[1:23:09] healing is not mine no more and they've
[1:23:11] given up and then they go to church and
[1:23:12] they hear something from God not from
[1:23:14] man if you're coming here expecting
[1:23:16] something from your pastor or brother
[1:23:18] steuart and you're expecting something
[1:23:19] to be just what a man can tell you to
[1:23:21] make you feel better a man can tell you
[1:23:23] to change your outcome of your life no
[1:23:25] we can't do anything to help you in that
[1:23:27] way but when God comes and speaks
[1:23:29] through a person it can change the
[1:23:30] situation
[1:23:32] completely God CH God God uses men God
[1:23:36] always has used men and God always will
[1:23:38] use men until we're out of here God's
[1:23:40] going to use a man to tell you right
[1:23:43] God's going to use a man to preach At
[1:23:45] You Preach to you God's going to use a
[1:23:47] man to tell you what the word would say
[1:23:49] and hey I tell you I'm just here to
[1:23:50] encourage you tonight I didn't come come
[1:23:52] here to try to revelate you I know these
[1:23:53] afternoon services are tough but I want
[1:23:55] to tell you this God's got your
[1:23:58] situation in
[1:24:01] control well I need you know I need this
[1:24:03] and I need that what you need is to get
[1:24:05] out on your knees and cry out to God say
[1:24:08] Lord help my situation and you say well
[1:24:11] I I did that but I didn't get an
[1:24:12] immediate response well just let him
[1:24:14] come in let him let him do it in his own
[1:24:17] good time let him do it when he chooses
[1:24:19] to show
[1:24:21] up we don't have have to
[1:24:23] worry about anything because he's got it
[1:24:26] all in control Lord Brother Brandon
[1:24:29] we're talking about this woman and there
[1:24:31] was a love for that little woman for her
[1:24:34] son she went over and stroked his head
[1:24:37] and kissed him and said God bless momy's
[1:24:38] baby great big fellow like that dying in
[1:24:41] shame and sin and yet that Mother's Love
[1:24:44] went he was still a baby still her baby
[1:24:46] no matter how much disgraced he was and
[1:24:48] how disgraced the family it was still
[1:24:50] that love of the mother that went out
[1:24:51] for a baby he said I think of that
[1:24:53] sometimes and think if a mother could
[1:24:54] forget her suckling babe God said I
[1:24:56] can't forget you your names are engraved
[1:24:58] on the palms of my hands how many
[1:24:59] believes that tonight he said he he said
[1:25:02] remember you can't get away from it well
[1:25:05] that's that's good right there you can't
[1:25:07] even run from it God knows he said he
[1:25:10] still loves you and that's why you're
[1:25:12] here tonight he's trying to give you
[1:25:14] another chance knocking at your
[1:25:17] door my he said I got down on the floor
[1:25:20] and he prayed with her
[1:25:23] and he said it seemed like that cold
[1:25:24] sticky certainly death was on the boy
[1:25:27] and said' Annie being that you are the
[1:25:29] mother of the boy won't you pray first
[1:25:30] and that's when I told you she was a
[1:25:31] Praying Woman brother B said she was a
[1:25:33] Praying Woman but he gets on down there
[1:25:35] he said and when he prayed he said he
[1:25:36] put his hands on his feet and said Lord
[1:25:38] I don't know what he said I don't know
[1:25:40] what to say he said is this why you made
[1:25:41] me miss my airplane to come down here to
[1:25:43] pray for This Woman's boy if it is oh
[1:25:45] Lord let it be known that you're God and
[1:25:47] you'll respect her prayers and her
[1:25:49] sincerity and about that time that big
[1:25:51] fell said oh Mom that it's getting light
[1:25:53] in the room now I wonder sometimes if we
[1:25:56] come with a sincere heart and we come
[1:25:58] back to God and you know it may look
[1:26:00] like we were in a bad situation and it's
[1:26:02] been Darkness after darkness and trial
[1:26:04] after trial and we can say mama it's
[1:26:07] getting light in the room now I can see
[1:26:09] daylight again why because God showed up
[1:26:12] just on time God has come to put light
[1:26:14] on your situation in an age of total
[1:26:17] darkness I think it's time that we are
[1:26:19] not no longer the children of Darkness
[1:26:21] but we are the children of light we are
[1:26:23] not walking in darkness but there is a
[1:26:25] light that has been shown in this age we
[1:26:27] don't have to worry about the way the
[1:26:29] ages have went before us and how their
[1:26:31] Messengers would only go so far and stop
[1:26:33] no the completion of the word has been
[1:26:35] restored to the church God has restored
[1:26:37] all things to us we have need of nothing
[1:26:40] but we have need of Jesus to show up and
[1:26:42] reveal what's already been brought to
[1:26:45] us musicians come I got 22 seconds and
[1:26:49] I'm done I'm on
[1:26:51] time
[1:26:53] God will show up in your
[1:26:54] situation thank you Lord but brother
[1:26:57] brandham said he said he needs you to be
[1:27:00] sincere and he said when that woman was
[1:27:03] sincere that's when God would respect
[1:27:05] her prayers thank you Lord God will
[1:27:08] respect your prayers if you're
[1:27:12] sincere God will respect your
[1:27:14] prayers if you'll just give him oh yeah
[1:27:17] first place in your
[1:27:19] life I want us to stand together
[1:27:24] I stayed on time tonight but I want to
[1:27:25] tell you this I I want just for a few
[1:27:27] moments I want to take this
[1:27:28] opportunity if you can play something if

[1:28:14] my my family they're in
[1:28:18] turmoil my life my job whatever it
[1:28:23] is whatever your situation is it's not
[1:28:27] too big for God to come on the scene and
[1:28:29] change it
[1:28:31] tonight with no one looking around if
[1:28:33] you're in a situation that you need
[1:28:35] prayer tonight I want you to raise your

[1:29:17] now but whatever made you raise your
[1:29:19] hand it don't have to be right now
[1:29:23] but what you need to know is that God
[1:29:24] will take care of that
[1:29:26] situation and when he takes care of it
[1:29:29] it will be in his time on time exactly
[1:29:34] the way he wants
[1:29:36] it if you need us to lay hands on you
