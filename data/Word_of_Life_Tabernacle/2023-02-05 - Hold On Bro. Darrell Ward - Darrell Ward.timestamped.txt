[35:23] the prophet said they have it for 2 000
[35:25] years but ye shall see me for I'll be
[35:28] with you even in you isn't that
[35:30] wonderful you think the
[35:31] you think about this brother brother Joe
[35:33] that The God Who created the heavens and
[35:36] the Earth
[35:37] and science says there's billions upon
[35:40] billions and trillions of stars just in
[35:43] our universe and they say there's
[35:44] universes out there multiple universes
[35:47] with billions and trillions of stars and
[35:49] the Bible says that our God
[35:52] knows every Star by name
[35:55] and The God Who was able to do that his
[35:58] desire was not to be above us not just
[36:01] to be with us
[36:03] but to be
[36:10] why can't we serve a God Like That
[36:15] the Lord Jesus kind of an honor to be
[36:18] with you and have a little thought on
[36:20] our heart we preached it here a while
[36:21] back but we just
[36:23] felt led to go this direction this
[36:25] evening so we trusted to be a blessing
[36:27] to you if you have your Bible start with
[36:28] us to the book of Second Kings and
[36:31] good to see each one out tonight and you
[36:34] know no matter what you're dealing with
[36:35] in your life I want you to look and
[36:36] believe that you serve a god who's able
[36:38] before this service is over to meet
[36:41] every need in this building
[36:44] amen
[36:46] Hallelujah
[36:48] I want to read now from second Kings
[36:49] chapter 4 verse starting at verse 25.
[36:54] praise the lord we appreciate
[36:57] the opportunity to be here and we trust
[36:59] that something will be said to help you
[37:01] and encourage you
[37:02] amen
[37:06] the Bible says this
[37:08] so she went and came into the man of God
[37:10] to Mount Carmel
[37:12] and it came to pass that when the man of
[37:14] God saw her afar off that he said to
[37:16] gehaza his servant behold Yonder is that
[37:19] shuttermite
[37:21] run now I pray thee to meet her and say
[37:23] unto her is it well with thee is it well
[37:27] with thy husband is it well with thy
[37:30] child and she answered it is well
[37:36] and when she came to the man of God to
[37:38] the hills she caught him by the feet but
[37:40] gehaza came near to thrust her away and
[37:43] the man of God said let her alone for
[37:45] her soul is vexed within her and the
[37:48] Lord hath hid it from me and hath not
[37:50] told me
[37:52] then she said did I desire a son of my
[37:56] Lord
[37:57] did I not say Do not deceive me
[38:01] then he said to God he's a gird of thy
[38:03] loins and take my staff in thine hand
[38:05] and go thy way and if thou meet any man
[38:07] salute him not and if any salute thee
[38:09] answer him not again and lay my staff
[38:12] upon the face of the child
[38:16] and the mother
[38:18] oh God
[38:21] and the mothers of the child said has
[38:24] the Lord liveth
[38:25] and as thy soul delivereth
[38:28] I will not leave
[38:30] and he arose and followed after her
[38:34] because she would not let go
[38:37] amen
[38:38] that's about our heads
[38:41] I want to speak to you for a few minutes
[38:44] on a little thought the lord gave me a
[38:46] while back
[38:47] I want to hold on
[38:50] Heavenly Father
[38:55] how great you are
[38:58] and Lord what a privilege it is to Bow
[39:01] our heads
[39:03] to the Earth from which you brought us
[39:05] from
[39:08] to give you honor and praise and glory
[39:10] for Thou Art Worthy
[39:14] and Lord as we are in your presence this
[39:17] evening
[39:19] Lord we go to prayer for our precious
[39:22] brother that we just got a text Lord
[39:24] that's laying on his dead bed
[39:27] and the doctors are saying that there's
[39:29] no hope
[39:31] but oh we serve a god who's more than
[39:35] able to move for this need
[39:38] and I pray father by that anointed that
[39:41] raised my Lord from the grave
[39:44] may it move Lord upon this need
[39:47] may he come forth well from the hospital
[39:50] because that's the kind of God that we
[39:53] serve
[39:54] Lord I pray tonight in this congregation
[39:57] Lord no doubt there's needs
[40:00] but Lord there's not a need in the midst
[40:02] of us that's greater than you
[40:04] so we look to you tonight the author and
[40:07] finisher of our faith and oh God we pray
[40:10] May there come such an anointing Dear
[40:12] God
[40:13] that the people's Faith are so
[40:15] illuminated that they can rise up and
[40:17] receive that which you've already given
[40:20] them Lord
[40:21] for you are our God
[40:23] the author and finisher of our faith
[40:26] bless your children tonight Lord bless
[40:28] the ministers here of this congregation
[40:30] the officers Lord and the saints that
[40:32] assemble here and all the visitors and
[40:35] those that are streaming Lord may you
[40:37] just meet their needs we pray for we ask
[40:40] these things in Jesus name and the bride
[40:43] says
[40:44] God bless you may be seated
[40:51] Hallelujah
[40:53] you know I was thinking of those that
[40:55] are listening in
[40:56] I believe it was in Ohio that it was
[40:59] during the pandemic and a lot of people
[41:01] you know wasn't able to come to church
[41:02] and there was a sister that was
[41:04] listening in on the service and that
[41:07] night it kind of broke into a prayer
[41:09] line and people was coming up for prayer
[41:11] and so
[41:11] uh this next sister stepped up and I
[41:14] said do you need something from the Lord
[41:15] sis and she said oh actually I just came
[41:18] to testify she said I was streaming at
[41:20] home and the spirit of the Lord came
[41:22] into the room and he healed me
[41:26] amen that's the kind of God we serve
[41:29] friends
[41:30] Hallelujah
[41:32] I want to speak to you for a few minutes
[41:34] on hold on
[41:36] now hold on means to endure
[41:40] or to keep going in difficult
[41:42] circumstances
[41:44] and there's terms you know that was used
[41:46] that has the same meaning as hold on as
[41:48] if if only they could hold on a little
[41:50] longer
[41:51] in other words that have the same
[41:53] meaning is to keep going to keep on to
[41:57] last to continue to persevere to
[42:01] struggle on to carry on to go on to hang
[42:05] on to hold out to not give up to see it
[42:09] through to stay the course or as when I
[42:12] was in the Army we used to say sold your
[42:15] own amen
[42:17] stick it out
[42:19] hang in there
[42:21] all those have the same meaning of hold
[42:24] on so then that tells me the opposite
[42:27] meaning of hold on is to give up
[42:30] is to let go it's a surrender and we're
[42:33] living in a time when many are getting
[42:35] discouraged and they're walking away and
[42:37] they're turning aside and they're giving
[42:39] up and they're looking on the internet
[42:41] and they're seeing this and they're
[42:42] seeing that and they're getting confused
[42:44] and they're throwing up their hands and
[42:46] they're wanting to walk away but I say
[42:47] to you not Church hold on
[42:50] the promise is still true amen this is
[42:53] our day this is our hour this is our
[42:56] time in the Sun that God chose us for
[42:58] this generation that we would overcome
[43:00] in this hour that we are living in and I
[43:03] say to you this message is still true
[43:05] it's still right God sent a prophet
[43:07] Hallelujah and the words that we are
[43:09] hearing is going to bring us into a body
[43:12] change and I say to you tonight I don't
[43:14] care how bad it gets how ugly it gets
[43:16] how tiresome it gets hold on do not give
[43:20] up do not turn back do not walk away
[43:23] because we're closer home tonight than
[43:25] we were yesterday amen
[43:29] Hallelujah
[43:30] hold on
[43:32] oh The Best Is Yet To Come
[43:37] oh Hallelujah now let's shoot him out
[43:40] woman that we're reading about tonight
[43:42] to me she's the very definition of hold
[43:45] on
[43:46] because you see she stayed the course
[43:50] she did not give up
[43:53] but to get an understanding of this we
[43:56] have to go back into the scriptures to
[43:58] find out where the story starts
[44:02] you see this woman we read about in the
[44:05] Bible
[44:06] it doesn't even give us her name
[44:10] but it does acknowledge her faith
[44:14] and you know I say tonight I don't care
[44:16] if the world Ever Knows My Name
[44:18] but let me have such a faith in my God
[44:22] that they will have to acknowledge that
[44:24] man believed his God for the impossible
[44:28] come on somebody I don't want to be
[44:30] found believing God for a little bit I
[44:32] want to believe God for everything that
[44:34] I can believe God for I want to believe
[44:36] him for the impossible because when I
[44:38] believe God to do big things I'm telling
[44:41] my God I believe you're a big God
[44:44] my God's Not puny my God's Not we come
[44:48] on somebody My God is Awesome
[44:53] amen if they never know my name let them
[44:57] know that I was a man of God who had
[44:59] faith in my God
[45:01] it doesn't give her name but it does
[45:04] acknowledge her faith
[45:06] and it tells us where she's from
[45:09] she is a shoutamite woman from the city
[45:12] of sumaine now Humane means a double
[45:15] rest
[45:17] she was from the city of a double rest
[45:21] or two places of rest
[45:24] now Humane is a city of of in ascar I
[45:29] believe it is north of Manassas about
[45:32] five miles south of Mount Tabor
[45:35] and the great prophet Elisha would
[45:38] travel through this city on his travels
[45:40] and so it came to pass us she noticed
[45:43] this man of God that she offered him
[45:46] some bread and befriended the man of God
[45:49] and one day she told her husband you
[45:52] know I want to make room in her house
[45:54] for the man of God perhaps we could get
[45:57] rid of the TV
[46:08] said I want to make room in our house
[46:10] for the men of God so he can have a
[46:12] place to stay when he passes through
[46:14] that he can have a place to rest in the
[46:17] city of rest
[46:21] and so she made room in her home for the
[46:24] prophet
[46:26] and no doubt she called this room the
[46:29] Elisha room
[46:31] you know what I was looking at it and I
[46:33] thought you know that's a good thing for
[46:35] us to do
[46:36] for all of us from the pulpit to the
[46:38] back door is to clean some of the junk
[46:41] out of our lives
[46:43] and make more room for Jesus
[46:48] amen you know I wonder sometimes if we
[46:51] spend as much time with our face in this
[46:53] book as we did on Facebook if we all
[46:56] wouldn't be just a little bit closer to
[46:58] our God
[47:00] but we let so many things because of the
[47:02] technology and the things and the access
[47:04] to with the iPhone we let so many things
[47:07] come into our life that sometimes we
[47:09] find out we ain't got much room left for
[47:11] him
[47:12] but I say he should have the preeminence
[47:14] in every one of our Lives whether we're
[47:16] two or eighty he deserves first place
[47:20] the prophet said he'll take any place
[47:22] that you give him but he deserves our
[47:25] best
[47:26] after all he gave his best for us we
[47:29] should give our best for him
[47:33] get some of the junk out of our lives
[47:35] like Elisha told him to dig the valley
[47:37] full of ditches the deeper you dig the
[47:40] more water you'll get
[47:42] oh God help us to dig out unbelief to
[47:45] dig out fear to dig out doubt
[47:48] to dig the Clutter out of our Lives to
[47:51] make more room
[47:52] for the Holy Ghost to come in
[47:55] so she did this act of kindness for this
[47:58] man of God
[48:00] and the Bible said that he who receives
[48:03] a prophet
[48:04] in the name of a prophet right receives
[48:07] a prophet's reward yes the prophet
[48:10] taught us that God cares God cares for
[48:13] people who cares
[48:15] God cares for those who care for him
[48:20] you see devils are not cast out by anger
[48:24] but devils are cast out by love
[48:27] we got all kinds of Revelation
[48:30] we got all kinds of message books but
[48:32] what I find lacking so much among the
[48:34] message people today is the love for one
[48:37] another
[48:38] we should never let our love grow cold
[48:41] if somebody draws us out we should draw
[48:44] a bigger Circle and draw them back in
[48:50] we should be a people who cares because
[48:53] I tell you we are living in a nation
[48:55] that don't care no more
[48:59] amen did not the prophet of God say it
[49:02] would come to pass that the only love
[49:04] there was left
[49:06] would be among the elect
[49:10] oh God help us tonight
[49:13] he cares for those he cares for him as
[49:16] you've done it unto the least of these
[49:19] you've done it unto me
[49:22] and so what she done it so pleased the
[49:25] prophet
[49:26] that he wanted to do something for her
[49:28] and Geezer said Master she doesn't have
[49:31] a child
[49:33] and the prophet said bring her here and
[49:35] he said this time next year
[49:38] according to the time of life you will
[49:41] have a child
[49:43] and just as the prophet said she had a
[49:47] child in it was a boy
[49:49] and with this boy was about 11 year old
[49:51] one day he went out to the Papa's field
[49:53] to work you know the prophet preached on
[49:55] this went out the new Harvest and the
[49:57] prophet said he must have had a
[49:59] sunstroke because he grabbed his head
[50:01] and began to say my head my head and he
[50:04] got more sick and more sick and so the
[50:07] father being real busy where he told one
[50:09] of the hard heads take the land home to
[50:12] his mother and place him on her lap
[50:15] and so they took the little fella in and
[50:18] laid him on his mother's lap and she
[50:21] kept him on her lap to about noon
[50:24] and the breath went out of him
[50:26] and the poor little boy
[50:28] died
[50:34] and with this how
[50:37] could be Faithfully flesh Lord
[50:40] when this happened you know what she did
[50:43] she took him and laid him on the
[50:46] prophet's bed
[50:48] now there's a great Revelation there see
[50:51] didn't take him to her bed nor did she
[50:54] take him to the husband's bed but she
[50:56] took him and laid him on the prophet's
[50:58] bed in the prophet's chamber
[51:01] where the Prophet had slept now why did
[51:04] she do that oh God because she knew that
[51:08] whatever that Prophet touched was
[51:10] blessed
[51:12] uh saints of God tonight do you realize
[51:15] how blessed we are our lives have been
[51:17] touched by the hand of God
[51:21] we are a blessed people tonight he has
[51:24] given us light in an hour of Darkness he
[51:26] has given us peace in the time of
[51:28] Despair rest in a time of unrest
[51:30] Revelation in a time of insanity
[51:36] there's so many questions today and
[51:39] that's true
[51:40] but we've got something the world don't
[51:42] have they've got all kinds of questions
[51:45] oh God but we've got the answer
[51:50] I said we have got the answer to the
[51:53] devil's question
[51:57] you may not have a hundred dollars in
[51:59] your pocket tonight
[52:00] but we are some of the richest people in
[52:02] Arkansas
[52:04] because our lives has been touched by
[52:08] the master
[52:10] you didn't stagger into this thing
[52:12] God knew before the foundation of the
[52:14] world you would be a part of this
[52:19] our lives have been touched
[52:22] by the hand of the master amen
[52:28] we could stop right here and spend weeks
[52:31] just starting right here and going and
[52:33] letting people testify of the things God
[52:36] has done for us
[52:37] sometimes it's good to remember
[52:41] I said sometimes it's good to remember
[52:43] all the Lord hath done for us
[52:49] you remember
[52:51] I remember one time they we was raised
[52:53] poor
[52:55] I remember coming home from school and
[52:56] they had repossessed the living room
[52:58] furniture my mama was crying
[53:02] I thought one day I'll buy my mom a
[53:05] living room suit
[53:06] and I did
[53:11] and I remember that we got the second
[53:13] notice they was going to cut the lights
[53:14] off
[53:16] because the bill wasn't paid but we
[53:18] didn't have the money to pay it
[53:21] a dead mom went to church that night and
[53:24] when they come home Daddy felt something
[53:25] in his pocket and he reached his hand in
[53:27] pocket and pulled out you know what it
[53:29] was it was enough money to pay the light
[53:31] bill
[53:32] that's the kind of God that we serve
[53:35] Hallelujah
[53:36] [Applause]
[53:42] said to her husband get a servant to
[53:45] saddle them you and go forward for me
[53:47] don't discernment said don't stop if
[53:49] anybody salutes you don't you sleep them
[53:51] back but you go straight to the man of
[53:53] God up at Mount Carmel
[53:55] oh look at this woman's Faith that's it
[53:57] for it no matter how bad the situation
[53:59] was she wasn't looking at the situation
[54:02] but she set her eyes on the go don't
[54:04] look back don't get sidetracked don't
[54:07] stop don't listen to the doubters just
[54:09] keep going
[54:12] and her husband said it's neither New
[54:15] Moon nor is it the Sabbath so the man of
[54:18] God won't be there you're wasting your
[54:20] time he's not there it's over just
[54:23] forget it
[54:24] the doctor says it's too far alone the
[54:27] doctor says it's incurable that's what
[54:29] the doctor says but we've got Isaiah's
[54:32] report
[54:35] listen to me say to God listen to me
[54:37] young people every time you make a move
[54:39] towards God you're going to have
[54:40] discouragers
[54:42] you're gonna have hindrances you're
[54:44] gonna have obstacles to try to stop you
[54:46] to try to turn you back to try to slow
[54:49] you down but I say to you just keep
[54:51] going
[54:54] you know the prophet talked about
[54:56] Barnacles of disappointments
[54:59] when things don't work out the way we
[55:01] thought and we get discouraged and the
[55:03] prophet said Barnacles of
[55:05] disappointments and you know what
[55:07] Barnacles are it's those crusty things
[55:09] that get on the bottom of boats and I
[55:11] did a little bitty study about it and
[55:13] you know what I found out that they say
[55:14] that the Barnacles on boats actually
[55:17] slows the boats down
[55:19] and makes them hard to steer well how
[55:22] the devil likes to give us Barnacles of
[55:25] disappointment to try to slow us down to
[55:27] try to change our course but I say press
[55:30] on hold on Hallelujah keep going towards
[55:33] the goal
[55:34] [Applause]
[55:37] you're wasting your time
[55:40] Satan trying to turn you back but I say
[55:42] don't listen to the critics just keep
[55:45] writing
[55:47] get to where the word of God is being
[55:50] manifested when you find where God's
[55:53] word is being manifested you have found
[55:56] deity in flesh
[55:59] oh let me say that again when you get to
[56:02] where God's word for your hour is being
[56:04] manifested you have found deity in flesh
[56:10] amen
[56:14] Hallelujah
[56:16] get the word of the word of God is being
[56:17] manifested and when she got to where
[56:20] Elisha was he seen her coming and he
[56:23] said go ask her is it well with the
[56:26] husband
[56:27] now why would he say that
[56:30] oh my God why would he even bring her
[56:33] husband up
[56:35] you see there's an awe seeing eye
[56:38] that's watching you
[56:40] come on friends God knows whether you
[56:42] first before you come to church or not
[56:46] well Glory yeah we're all human put up
[56:49] your angel wings it's all right
[56:53] he said go ask her is it well with thy
[56:56] husband is it well with the boy is it
[56:59] well with thee look her son was laying
[57:01] dead on the prophet's bed she'd had a
[57:04] disagreement with her husband whether to
[57:06] even go there or not
[57:09] but in the midst of all of her
[57:11] disappointment and the death and the
[57:13] sorrow and the pain and the fear and the
[57:16] discouragement and the argument with her
[57:17] husband in the midst of all of it she
[57:20] said it is well
[57:22] and is there anybody here tonight who
[57:25] can testify it is well
[57:30] I'm having a hard time brother Daryl but
[57:32] it's well
[57:34] Hallelujah I don't have ten dollars to
[57:37] my name but it's well brother though
[57:42] she said it is well
[57:45] amen I like that all is well because she
[57:50] was in the presence
[57:51] of the prophet
[57:57] she said all is well
[57:59] because she was in the presence of the
[58:02] Prophet if she had that much confidence
[58:05] standing in the presence of a prophet
[58:07] how much more confidence are you and I
[58:10] have tonight standing in the presence of
[58:12] the one who sent the prophet
[58:15] come on Hallelujah brother Brandon's not
[58:18] here he's been gone since 65 but the one
[58:21] who sent the prophet
[58:23] amen the one who sent the prophet he is
[58:26] here with us tonight he said I'll never
[58:28] leave you nor will I forsake you in the
[58:31] good times in the bad times in the hard
[58:33] times I will be with you
[58:40] amen then no matter what we face in life
[58:44] we do not face it alone
[58:49] yeah you know I walk through the valley
[58:51] of the shadow of death thou art with me
[58:58] all sights of God I say to you tonight
[59:01] always will
[59:03] you may be having trouble but all is
[59:06] well you may be sick but all is well you
[59:09] may be having great difficulties but I
[59:12] say to you all is well
[59:15] because we are standing in the presence
[59:18] of Jesus Christ
[59:22] foreign
[59:25] you see the trouble of the Dead
[59:28] some people
[59:29] you know brother I heard brother biscal
[59:31] say years ago that Jesus will be just as
[59:34] real to you as your faith can declare
[59:37] him to be
[59:39] and I thought that's so true because you
[59:41] see some people see Jesus every time
[59:44] they come to church because their faith
[59:47] declares him to be here
[59:49] some people come and never see him
[59:52] because their Faith Can't declare it
[59:55] you see it's not what we see with the
[59:57] eyes of our head because the eyes of her
[59:59] head will actually lie to us
[1:00:03] but we don't see him with the eyes of
[1:00:05] our head we see him with the eyes of our
[1:00:07] hearts
[1:00:09] and if you get an understanding that the
[1:00:12] God that was with Jesus the groom that
[1:00:15] same God is now with the bride yes
[1:00:21] it was God in Jesus form now it's God in
[1:00:24] Bride for him making him the same
[1:00:26] yesterday today and forever
[1:00:28] you'll be able to play the prophet of
[1:00:30] God said he went to Sister Rebecca's
[1:00:32] school play and there was one guy there
[1:00:34] who played three or four different parts
[1:00:36] it was the same guy but he would go
[1:00:39] behind the veil and change his costume
[1:00:41] and come out that's somebody else but it
[1:00:43] was him the whole time
[1:00:48] and here not long ago we was wearing
[1:00:50] masks I was in a grocery store
[1:00:52] I'd stopped to get a drink some gas and
[1:00:55] if they must have been this guy was a
[1:00:57] local guy and you know how everybody was
[1:00:59] wearing masks and I was standing over
[1:01:00] next to the potato chips
[1:01:03] and this guy comes walking into the
[1:01:05] store with his mascot and the cash
[1:01:07] register lady she goes
[1:01:09] she goes why John
[1:01:11] you've changed your mask
[1:01:15] and when she said that I about shouted
[1:01:17] past the Frito Lays
[1:01:19] because that Revelation struck my heart
[1:01:22] don't you see that's all God has done
[1:01:24] he's just
[1:01:25] he's just changed his mask
[1:01:30] they're all going to God
[1:01:35] Hallelujah
[1:01:38] she came to the man of God the Bible
[1:01:40] says and she caught him by the feet but
[1:01:42] gehaza came near to thrust her away
[1:01:45] he couldn't he said get off the man of
[1:01:47] God ain't it something even when you
[1:01:49] come to church those people still trying
[1:01:51] to discourage you
[1:01:55] you'll be trying to get into the worship
[1:01:57] and they're setting like
[1:02:05] come on
[1:02:08] he comes to get off the man of God leave
[1:02:12] him alone
[1:02:15] and Elisha said let her alone for her
[1:02:18] soul is next have the Lord hath hid it
[1:02:20] from me and he's not told me
[1:02:23] so for you folks that thinks God's
[1:02:25] prophets know everything
[1:02:27] I beg to differ with you
[1:02:30] see a prophet only knows what God will
[1:02:34] allow him to know
[1:02:36] you remember the valley that was full of
[1:02:38] dry bones and he asked Ezekiel hey
[1:02:40] Ezekiel can these bones live and what
[1:02:44] did the prophet of God say he said oh
[1:02:45] Lord God thou knowest
[1:02:48] I don't know Lord but you know and I'll
[1:02:51] know if you tell me Hallelujah
[1:02:56] [Applause]
[1:02:59] and she said to the man of God did I did
[1:03:03] I desire a son of my Lord was I the one
[1:03:05] to come seeking you for a child
[1:03:09] no you came to me did I not say Do not
[1:03:12] deceive me
[1:03:14] and then he said to God he's a good up
[1:03:16] thy Lords and take my staff in thy hand
[1:03:18] and go thy way if I meet someone salute
[1:03:20] him not if they salute the answer me not
[1:03:22] back and go and lay my staff upon the
[1:03:24] face of the child
[1:03:26] now that sounds pretty good
[1:03:28] but that wasn't good enough
[1:03:31] it wasn't good enough for her
[1:03:36] you know it's like that song we sung I
[1:03:39] got a little saying say fill my cup Lord
[1:03:41] but you know if we really got a
[1:03:43] revelation of how much God wants to
[1:03:45] bless us we would really sing fill my
[1:03:48] truck
[1:03:53] now some people might have
[1:03:55] some people might have been satisfied
[1:03:57] with the staff
[1:03:59] but why take the staff of the Prophet
[1:04:01] when you've got your hands on the
[1:04:03] prophet himself
[1:04:04] [Music]
[1:04:06] and why would we take some cold Creed
[1:04:09] Dead photos
[1:04:10] religion when you can have the real
[1:04:13] thing
[1:04:14] why would we take an invitation when we
[1:04:17] can have the real anointing amen
[1:04:22] and the mother of the child said as the
[1:04:24] Lord liveth and as thy soul liveth I
[1:04:27] will not leave thee
[1:04:30] and the Bible said he arose and
[1:04:33] throttled her
[1:04:35] yeah she must have been pretty
[1:04:36] persuasive
[1:04:39] oh no oh no she said I'm in your
[1:04:41] presence I'm not leaving you I'm holding
[1:04:43] on
[1:04:44] I'm not letting go of you you said God
[1:04:47] would give me a son if you spoke a son
[1:04:49] for me once
[1:04:51] you can do it again
[1:04:53] I'm not leaving you your saints of God
[1:04:55] if God's ever touched you once can he do
[1:04:57] it again if God's ever delivered you
[1:05:00] once cannot he deliver you again
[1:05:03] Hallelujah if God's ever healed you one
[1:05:06] time can I heal you again
[1:05:09] we serve a God hallelujah who raises the
[1:05:13] dead and opened the blinded eyes who
[1:05:15] turns water into wine how many times
[1:05:17] does he have to do it
[1:05:19] before we believe it
[1:05:25] when Elijah seen he had her on his hands
[1:05:28] there was nothing else to do but go with
[1:05:30] her and the prophet of God said
[1:05:34] he said if you'll stay with the Holy
[1:05:35] Spirit
[1:05:37] like she stay with Elisha
[1:05:40] she grabbed him by the feet and she
[1:05:42] wasn't letting go she was holding on
[1:05:45] she was on his hands
[1:05:47] and you stay on Jesus hands like that
[1:05:51] get on his hands and stay there if he
[1:05:54] loves you well enough to come to you and
[1:05:56] bless you and save you then stay on his
[1:05:59] hands
[1:06:02] you see the answer to every problem in
[1:06:05] this building it's not Google
[1:06:09] it's Jesus Christ
[1:06:11] he was the answer yesterday he's the
[1:06:13] answer today and if there is a tomorrow
[1:06:15] he will be the answer tomorrow
[1:06:19] he's the answer for cancer he's the
[1:06:21] answer for arthritis he's the answer for
[1:06:23] sugar diabetes he's the answer for high
[1:06:25] blood low blood no blood
[1:06:28] he's the answer
[1:06:31] he's the answer for rebellious teenagers
[1:06:34] sometimes we need to hold them do we
[1:06:36] hold them too tight sometimes we need to
[1:06:39] take that little rebellious child and
[1:06:40] just put him into the hands of Jesus
[1:06:46] well that's what our mama done to some
[1:06:48] of us and it worked out all right
[1:06:50] well preach brother I think you believe
[1:06:51] we will
[1:06:52] surely you Arkansas boys today man that
[1:07:00] let me be catch my breath I'm getting
[1:07:03] old
[1:07:06] the prophet said oh I like that
[1:07:08] when you take a hold of God for
[1:07:10] something don't you turn loose
[1:07:14] that's right just hold on to him if we
[1:07:18] could take a hold of God's agent God's
[1:07:20] agent then was Elisha God's agent today
[1:07:23] is the Holy Spirit
[1:07:25] then hold on to it when you ever come in
[1:07:28] contact and you feel the Holy Spirit on
[1:07:30] you then hold on to it I'll not leave
[1:07:32] you stay with it like Jacob did when he
[1:07:35] wrestled with the angel he said I'm
[1:07:36] going to hold on to you bless me until
[1:07:39] you give me the things that I'm Desiring
[1:07:41] notice
[1:07:44] it wasn't Jacob saying let me go let me
[1:07:47] go let me go it was the angel saying let
[1:07:50] me go
[1:07:54] Jacob said I ain't gonna let you go
[1:07:56] until I get what I have need of look God
[1:08:00] give us Faith like that today
[1:08:04] our faith is so wishy-washy we'll feel
[1:08:06] something go out testifying the next day
[1:08:08] we get up with a symptom and we think we
[1:08:10] didn't get it that ain't Faith that's
[1:08:11] hope
[1:08:13] faith will stay there and Proclaim I'm
[1:08:15] Healed regardless amen
[1:08:18] [Music]
[1:08:22] it was the angel saying let me go not
[1:08:24] Jacob
[1:08:26] oh God Give Me Faith to hang on to an
[1:08:28] angel like that
[1:08:29] he said I'll not let you go I like that
[1:08:32] hold on to him that's right he stayed
[1:08:33] all night with him you see her faith
[1:08:35] wasn't in the staff it was in the
[1:08:38] prophet and so she said as the Lord your
[1:08:40] God lives and never dies and your soul
[1:08:41] never dies I'm not going to leave you
[1:08:44] I'm going to stay right there with you I
[1:08:47] want to stay right here and the prophet
[1:08:49] said if you take Jesus for your healer

[1:08:55] ever back you out of it
[1:08:58] you hold on I'll stay with it I'll stay

[1:09:16] and I took some soap and I wrote on the
[1:09:17] mirror he is my healer and every morning
[1:09:20] when I get up I see it every time I
[1:09:22] brush my teeth I see it amen because I
[1:09:24] want the devil to know I'm not believing
[1:09:26] the symptoms I'm not believing the back
[1:09:28] pain I'm not believing the MRI I'm not
[1:09:30] believing the CT scan but I believe in
[1:09:32] The God Who made this body and if he
[1:09:34] made this body he could heal this body
[1:09:36] come on somebody and so I'm going to
[1:09:38] testify of my God because he is my
[1:09:41] healer he is my sustainer he ought
[1:09:43] Hallelujah he gave me my breath and
[1:09:46] nobody can take my breath to he says so

[1:16:02] stomach still hurt
[1:16:03] days went by but they testified and
[1:16:06] testified and testified and it got to

[1:16:30] [Music]
[1:16:33] so she kept testifying you know the
[1:16:36] story she got up one morning and the
[1:16:37] kids left you know they left in a hurry
[1:16:39] didn't finish the oatmeal and she ate it
[1:16:41] didn't hurt
[1:16:42] she ate some toast it didn't hurt she
[1:16:45] drank some Maxwell House because it's
[1:16:46] good to the last drop
[1:16:49] and it didn't hurt

[1:17:06] screaming
[1:17:07] and when she got to where the woman at
[1:17:10] the Garter she was getting ready to
[1:17:11] knock on the door and she heard
[1:17:15] and she went running in and the Garter
[1:17:17] was gone
[1:17:19] she was shaking the sheets looking for
[1:17:21] him you know what the prophet of God
[1:17:23] said the angel of the Lord was passing
[1:17:26] through the neighborhood confirming the
[1:17:29] blessing
[1:17:30] [Music]
[1:17:32] Hallelujah and when the angel came
[1:17:35] through what did he find he found that
[1:17:37] they were holding on he found that they
[1:17:40] were still testified and I say with the
[1:17:42] angel passes by for your healing let it
[1:17:45] be found let him find you believe it let
[1:17:48] him find you testify him then he finds
[1:17:50] you praising God not give any worship
[1:17:54] yes sir
[1:17:56] Hallelujah
[1:18:02] I quoted this last night at brother Bo's
[1:18:04] but I think it'd be good to quote it
[1:18:05] again tonight
[1:18:06] listen to this
[1:18:08] the God said they shall lay hands on the
[1:18:10] sick and they shall recover now the
[1:18:12] outside world wants you to believe as
[1:18:15] soon as you lay hands on them that
[1:18:17] crippled leg must straighten out you
[1:18:19] must jump up and down now the world
[1:18:21] wants us to believe when you come up
[1:18:23] here sick and be prayed for that
[1:18:24] instantly that blinded eye supposed to
[1:18:26] come open and sometimes it does
[1:18:29] we've seen that I've seen cancers
[1:18:31] disappear in the meeting yes I have
[1:18:34] seen a man down in Nicaragua we've been
[1:18:36] over at a 90 degree angle blowed his
[1:18:38] back out laying brick came through a
[1:18:39] prayer line when he got to the end of it
[1:18:40] he was standing up more straighter than
[1:18:42] I am he shouted that place to the ground
[1:18:47] amen
[1:18:49] but the outside world wants you to
[1:18:51] believe that as soon as that crippled
[1:18:53] leg is prayed for it must straighten out
[1:18:55] and that person's supposed to jump up
[1:18:56] and down but the prophet said he never
[1:18:59] said that
[1:19:01] he never promised that
[1:19:05] now listen this will help our faith the
[1:19:08] prayer of faith shall save the sick and
[1:19:10] God will raise them up
[1:19:12] but he never said when
[1:19:16] he said they shall lay their hands on
[1:19:18] the sick and they shall Shout
[1:19:22] that means you expect it to happen they
[1:19:24] shall not could be not hope so not maybe
[1:19:26] they shall you know like repent be
[1:19:28] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and
[1:19:30] you shall receive the gift of the Holy
[1:19:31] Ghost it's the same shall
[1:19:34] they shall lay their hands upon the sick
[1:19:37] and they shall recover
[1:19:40] but he never said when
[1:19:42] you pray believe that you receive it and
[1:19:45] it shall be given to you he just didn't
[1:19:48] say when
[1:19:50] so what should we do
[1:19:52] hold on
[1:19:54] just hold on
[1:19:55] well brother there I was prayed for I
[1:19:57] feel no different hold on
[1:20:00] feeling has nothing to do with
[1:20:04] it like Elijah and Elisha and Elijah
[1:20:07] laid the man on Elisha while he was
[1:20:09] plowing out in the field now the mantle
[1:20:11] didn't fit Elisha but Elisha wanted that
[1:20:14] mantle so he took off after Elijah and
[1:20:18] he held on he wasn't leaving Elijah till
[1:20:20] he got that mantle
[1:20:23] he laid it upon it I said it wouldn't
[1:20:25] fit
[1:20:26] but Elisha held on for 10 years
[1:20:31] till God tripped him to fit the mantle
[1:20:34] and let me say tonight God will never
[1:20:37] cut this message to fit our petty ideals
[1:20:40] but he will Whittle us down I said he
[1:20:43] will Whittle us down until we fit the
[1:20:46] mantle
[1:20:46] [Applause]
[1:20:49] because this bride will wear the mantle
[1:20:54] he didn't already lie to the fifth the
[1:20:56] robe but he altered he ordered the
[1:20:59] excuse me I got that backwards he didn't
[1:21:01] order the robe to fit Elisha but he
[1:21:03] honored Elisha to fit the robe and he
[1:21:06] will cut us and mold us and shape us hey
[1:21:09] don't you see my brother my sister
[1:21:10] that's what the trials and tests of life
[1:21:12] is for
[1:21:15] you see God there is no trial there is
[1:21:18] no test that will defeat God's people
[1:21:20] that's not the purpose of it
[1:21:23] but it's to mold you and to shape you
[1:21:26] and to build your faith
[1:21:29] how do you build muscles by lifting
[1:21:31] weights a resistance
[1:21:34] you see if ever get home
[1:21:36] if every time we ask God God instantly
[1:21:39] gave us something you know what it'd
[1:21:40] make us a bunch of spoiled brats
[1:21:43] truth
[1:21:45] amen we got a bunch of them today in
[1:21:48] this nation
[1:21:50] well Glory
[1:21:52] I'm just glad it's none of our young
[1:21:54] people
[1:21:57] Hallelujah
[1:21:58] amen
[1:22:00] the Bible says be confident of this very
[1:22:02] thing he which begun a good work in you
[1:22:04] will perform it until the day of Jesus
[1:22:07] Christ
[1:22:10] now when it come time for Elijah to
[1:22:12] leave the scene
[1:22:14] he asked Elisha what do you want you're
[1:22:17] holding on to me you ain't letting go of
[1:22:19] me what do you want
[1:22:21] notice what Elisha said he saw the
[1:22:25] anointing of Elijah but he didn't just
[1:22:28] ask for the anointing of Elijah he asked
[1:22:31] for a double portion of the anointing
[1:22:38] you see Jesus was anointed he healed the
[1:22:42] sick he cast out Devils it was one man
[1:22:44] anointed to do the signs and wonders but
[1:22:47] now
[1:22:48] that anointing has fell Upon A many
[1:22:50] membered bride and all around the world
[1:22:54] Miracles and signs and wonders are
[1:22:57] taking place
[1:22:58] [Music]
[1:22:59] Hallelujah he said I want to double
[1:23:01] portion of your spirit might become upon
[1:23:03] me and the prophet said that's the way
[1:23:05] to ask ask plenty God likes to give you
[1:23:08] just as much faith
[1:23:15] with the trouble of it is today the
[1:23:16] prophet says people say well I asked the
[1:23:18] father for so much
[1:23:21] but the prophet said don't be scared to
[1:23:22] ask him ask all you can ask he likes to
[1:23:26] give you just as much as you've got
[1:23:28] faith to receive
[1:23:30] you see God won't run out
[1:23:33] he's got plenty of
[1:23:36] just hold on to the promise now Elisha
[1:23:39] got the mantle
[1:23:41] and he goes back down to the river
[1:23:43] remember they went to the river Elijah
[1:23:45] took the man and struck the water water
[1:23:47] party went over on dry ground water
[1:23:48] closed back Elijah turned their lives
[1:23:50] and said what he want he said I want a
[1:23:51] double portion of your spirit and that
[1:23:53] she went up in a chariot of fire and the
[1:23:54] man who came down and Elisha caught the
[1:23:57] mantle and he put it on and after 10
[1:23:59] years of walking with the prophet the
[1:24:01] man of fit and he goes back to the same
[1:24:03] river with the same with the same manner
[1:24:06] and he stuck the water and he said where
[1:24:08] is the god of Elijah
[1:24:12] he wasn't asking a question he was
[1:24:14] making a statement the God that was on
[1:24:16] Elijah it's now on me and the God that
[1:24:19] was on Jesus Christ is now in his church
[1:24:22] amen
[1:24:22] [Applause]

[1:25:17] promise

[1:25:20] black girl did down in Memphis down here
[1:25:22] in Jonesboro she's from Memphis but down
[1:25:24] here in Jonesboro Arkansas you remember
[1:25:25] the story she was blind and she heard on
[1:25:27] the radio
[1:25:28] that there was a man from up in Kennett
[1:25:30] had got his eyes sucked
[1:25:33] and her papa got the money and they
[1:25:34] charted a bus and they went up to where
[1:25:36] the meeting was
[1:25:39] right and when they got there to the
[1:25:40] meeting can I have just a little bit of
[1:25:42] time
[1:25:44] when they got to the meeting there were
[1:25:45] so many people outside the church that
[1:25:47] couldn't even get in
[1:25:49] discouragement
[1:25:51] spent all their money come up there
[1:25:52] couldn't even get into the church
[1:25:54] but her daddy said honey you stay right
[1:25:56] here I'll go find a Healer
[1:25:59] and she was standing there and somebody
[1:26:01] bumped her and she got lost in the crowd
[1:26:03] you know the story
[1:26:04] well the prophet of God said that come
[1:26:06] and got him off the platform eight days
[1:26:08] and nights he said I've been there just
[1:26:09] sipping some orange juice praying for
[1:26:11] the people because I had promised I
[1:26:12] would pray for every person but at the
[1:26:14] end of eight days there was more to pray
[1:26:15] for than there was the first day
[1:26:18] and he said but they come and got me
[1:26:20] because there's a woman out in the
[1:26:21] ambulance that they said were dead
[1:26:24] said they took me out around this way
[1:26:26] and put me up in the ambulance and the
[1:26:27] prophet prayed for the woman and God
[1:26:29] gave her life back to her
[1:26:31] and he said I come down on the ambulance
[1:26:33] and said no brother Brandon we'll never
[1:26:35] get you back the way you come we've got
[1:26:37] to go around this way and the prophet
[1:26:38] said you see how God works things
[1:26:43] but you know when I was listening to
[1:26:45] this story I got this little tidbit I
[1:26:47] want to share with you it was all these
[1:26:50] people come
[1:26:51] for the prophet of God to pray for him
[1:26:53] they were standing outside the church
[1:26:56] that they didn't have monitors
[1:27:00] they didn't have monitors
[1:27:03] so they didn't know what brother Branham
[1:27:04] looked like
[1:27:05] they didn't know brother better from
[1:27:07] Adam all they do there's a man in there
[1:27:08] praying for the sick and God was
[1:27:10] answering this prayer
[1:27:12] and here he was trying to get through
[1:27:14] the crowd to get back in the church and
[1:27:16] he was saying excuse me but yeah I saw
[1:27:18] if I didn't mean to step on your toes
[1:27:19] around I'm trying to get around this way
[1:27:21] and the people might have said but would
[1:27:23] you move I'm trying to get in there and
[1:27:25] see the man of God and the Very one they
[1:27:27] was wanting to see
[1:27:28] was passing right among them
[1:27:31] and they failed to recognize
[1:27:34] and I was thinking about that brother
[1:27:36] Joel and I thought I wonder brother Dale
[1:27:37] how many times has Jesus Christ passed
[1:27:41] right through the midst of our assembly
[1:27:44] and we failed to recognize him
[1:27:47] because we didn't see the mask
[1:27:51] that he was bailed by
[1:27:56] think about that
[1:27:58] they was wanting to see the very best
[1:28:00] but he would you move I'd try to get in
[1:28:02] there and the one they was wanting to
[1:28:05] see
[1:28:06] right in front of me
[1:28:09] and one day I think friends will rise
[1:28:11] just how close Jesus was to you
[1:28:16] sitting right there veiled in your son
[1:28:18] veiled in your wife
[1:28:21] found in your pastor vowed in the
[1:28:24] deepest
[1:28:29] and he was coming around through there
[1:28:30] and he heard this this girl and she said
[1:28:33] with someone to help me please would
[1:28:35] someone please help me I'm blind I've
[1:28:38] lost my father I can't see yeah
[1:28:42] the prophet said I God stood there where
[1:28:44] she would bump into me
[1:28:49] she said excuse me sir he said what is
[1:28:52] it that you want
[1:28:54] she said I'm lost in the blood and I'm
[1:28:56] trying to find my papa
[1:28:59] he said we come up here to see the
[1:29:00] Healer and he told me to stand right
[1:29:02] here but I got bumped and now I'm lost
[1:29:04] and I don't know where he's at he said
[1:29:06] you come to see the what she said they
[1:29:08] either
[1:29:09] he said surely you don't believe in that
[1:29:11] as many fine doctors as we have today
[1:29:14] he said but you see sir
[1:29:16] they can't help me
[1:29:19] I'm so glad
[1:29:21] what the doctors told me that they
[1:29:23] couldn't help my daughter
[1:29:26] I was glad I knew someone who could yeah
[1:29:33] you know this story means so much to me
[1:29:37] I had a blind child
[1:29:40] and the same Lord Jesus that opened
[1:29:43] blind bartimaeus's eyes opened Jessica's
[1:29:46] eyes
[1:29:51] laughs and he said I looked at her and I
[1:29:54] told her I said maybe I'm the one you're
[1:29:56] supposed to see he said you see how God
[1:29:58] blocks things exactly right why was I
[1:30:00] taken to the back and said she grabbed
[1:30:02] me by the lapels of my coat like that
[1:30:03] and she said are you the Healer are you
[1:30:06] the Healer and I said no sister I'm not
[1:30:09] I'm just your brother
[1:30:13] she said I want to see the Healer and I
[1:30:16] said I hope that you see him someday and
[1:30:18] I believe you will and she said what is
[1:30:20] your name
[1:30:21] and I said brother Branham and she said
[1:30:24] use the one I want to see
[1:30:27] and I said now no one knows it's me I'll
[1:30:30] pray for you but but don't let it be
[1:30:32] known I said take your hands off he said
[1:30:34] I couldn't pull her hands off of my
[1:30:36] lapel she was holding on for dear life
[1:30:40] and I said I'll pray for you I can pray
[1:30:43] if you'll believe
[1:30:45] and she said that's all I ask you to do
[1:30:48] they said we bowed our heads and while
[1:30:50] we were praying I heard a scream and she
[1:30:53] ran into that lot throwing people one
[1:30:55] way or the other and she fell on the
[1:30:56] ground screaming I who was what's blood
[1:31:00] can now see
[1:31:02] he said a few weeks ago I got a letter
[1:31:04] from her she said oh her eyes are 20 20.
[1:31:07] this was actually like 12 years later he
[1:31:09] was telling the story he said I just got
[1:31:11] a letter the other day and her eyes are
[1:31:13] 20 20. she doesn't even wear glasses or
[1:31:16] nothing said it's the amazing grace of
[1:31:18] God that does these things it's
[1:31:20] something that Jesus Christ gave to his
[1:31:22] church to enjoy the Privileges of good
[1:31:24] health
[1:31:26] but when the people saw that young black
[1:31:28] girl with her sight thou stood an old
[1:31:30] man with a club and twisted foot he said
[1:31:32] I know who you are brother Branham I've
[1:31:34] been standing here
[1:31:38] three days
[1:31:40] in the rain
[1:31:42] oh God
[1:31:45] Forgive Me Lord
[1:31:48] three days in the rain
[1:31:52] not 30 minutes in an air conditioned
[1:31:54] building on a padded seat but three days
[1:31:57] in the rain just to be prayed for
[1:32:01] I remember one time way up in the
[1:32:03] mountains of Nicaragua the place called
[1:32:05] mencona manchones
[1:32:07] there's a woman came there about 75 year
[1:32:10] old her leg was busted open she said it
[1:32:12] was leprosy but it looked like a
[1:32:13] diabetic ulcers to me
[1:32:15] but they told me that that woman had
[1:32:17] walked an hour and a half with her leg
[1:32:20] like that just to be prayed for
[1:32:23] I thought oh my God how could God not
[1:32:25] honor things like that
[1:32:30] he said I know who you are Brother Brad
[1:32:32] I've been standing here three days in
[1:32:34] the rain if you'll just ask God God will
[1:32:37] heal my foot what can be done at that
[1:32:39] time I said to him my brother if you
[1:32:41] believe Jesus died and rose again the
[1:32:43] third day to make these things possible
[1:32:45] hand me your club and when he handed me
[1:32:47] that club he wasn't kidding he meant it
[1:32:49] yeah I've seen with my own two eyes that
[1:32:52] Twisted club foot come straight and he
[1:32:55] jumped into the air and began to scream
[1:32:56] had four men rushed around me and people
[1:32:58] with mothers with their little babies
[1:33:00] tried to get in close enough just to
[1:33:02] touch that old raggedy coat and God was
[1:33:04] healing them it wasn't the Ragged coat
[1:33:07] nor it wasn't the one that was wearing
