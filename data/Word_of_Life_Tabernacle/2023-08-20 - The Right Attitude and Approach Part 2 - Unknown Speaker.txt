I feel like I'm coughing up a hay bale this morning but he had me out there working me into the ground he's about 90 years old so I don't have much of a voice today but true saying they don't make them like they used to I'm not near as tough as them old Old-Timers so but you love the Lord this morning so I guess what I'm trying to say is if you didn't cough up a hay bale this morning you'd be

free amen amen the Lord aren't you glad his spirit is here he said where two or three are gathered togetherness God bless you this morning you can be seated for just a minute that's all the morning and we'll take just a minute make a couple of announcements before we read our scripture this morning don't forget that fish fry on Saturday September 2nd I don't know how you could forget that but just in case they'll have some chicken there for the kids and stuff too for those of you adults who don't like fish so welcome to come to that and try to let brother Harvey or sister Jackie know if you're going to come we don't know how many to plan for we were going to have a baptism today but the the sister didn't wasn't able to come and but I appreciate brother Robert Smith witnessing to his co-worker and uh I believe that that'll bear fruit brother Robert and it'll be a blessing to them I you know we just live our life that's the main way that we witness is just by living and just by being who we are and people see that's a Christian and and that's what we want to do more than we don't want to push a Doctrine on anybody that's not our our desire our goal we want to just live and and be Christians and love people and and be a part of our communities I've never wanted to be hidden but we want to be a light but Jesus said a city set on a hill it cannot be hit he said you don't put a light a Candlestick under a bushel so bushel basket so we're thankful that brother Robert was able to witness to his co-worker and I pray the Lord will just work in that situation but the tank is filled if anyone needs to be baptized wants to be baptized we'd be glad to do that for you today um brother Stewart's going to be at Gibson this evening at work brother Ivey said Living Word Tabernacle preaching over there be praying for him brother Stewart was a real blessing to us last week wasn't he my goodness wonderful wonderful I'm still chewing on some of those things so brother Stewart I I might have to steal some of that at some point and so we're um I was glad to hear that and he's going over there and maybe wants to support him you're welcome to do that but the Joel will be preaching here this afternoon and looking forward to that we're going to have uh in the afternoons uh coming up I don't I know it's a long day on Sundays but we're here and uh so I want to do something a little bit special I'm always praying about ways that we can help as a church we don't want to be we don't want to tell people what to do that's not what we do this isn't a forced religion we don't we don't force things on people or tell them what to do what we want to do is give you the material that if you want to live according to the scriptures that you can because we want to teach you the things of God and and that's our role and that goes down to every area of our life well I've been praying about about for a while but something we could do for the couples and what we're going to do is have a for the Allen price is here with us and he's a wonderful uh Financial guy he's a bank president Community Bank president at fnbc and uh just uh done a marvelous job in that way I'm not good with money so for me to teach you about money I can tell you what the Bible says but but I have to I have to be reminded of things like that every once in a while so like we all do but brother Alan is going to be teaching a financial uh from the scriptures and things he's going to be teaching on finances in the afternoons starting at 1 30 next Sunday so I would encourage especially younger couples to be there and uh and listen to that if you can I know that's a little bit difficult being here all day but like I said you probably at the fellowship hall talking about that next that buck you're going to get or something like that anyway so if you can come and everyone's welcome but especially geared to the younger couples and the couples in general I'm looking forward to it because I need to be reminded you know to make a budget number one and and to stay on it but that's optional again we just want to provide you with the tools to be able to do what God has called us to do and like I said that's the way we live our lives is to just be Christians not to tell people about it as much although that's part of it but just to be Christians in the world that we live in and and that's part of that so we're going to try that he'll probably do that probably taking more than one Sunday because he'll only have about an hour to do that in before the next service so he'll do that over two or three Sundays the Lord willing and we're looking forward to that do you love the Lord this morning how many are glad to be in the house of God Amen good to have our visitors with us this morning God bless you guys thank you for coming and each one that's here and those that are watching this morning unable to be here I pray the Lord would bless you let's Stand Together Matthew chapter 15 and verse 21. Matthew chapter 15 and verse 21. how many believe God is good all the time isn't he amen Matthew 15 21 it says then Jesus went Vents and departed into the coast of tire and sidon and behold a woman of Canaan came out of the same Coast and Cried unto him saying have mercy on me O Lord thou son of David my daughter is grievously vexed with the Devil but he answered her not a word and his disciples came and besought him saying send her away for she crieth after us but he answered and said I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the House of Israel then came she and worshiped him saying Lord help me but he answered and said it is not meat to take the children's bread in other words it's not appropriate take the children's bread and to cast it to dogs and she said truth Lord look at her attitude truth Lord yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters table then Jesus answered and said unto her old woman great is thy faith be it unto thee even as thou Wilt and her daughter was made whole from that very hour amen let's bow our heads together for a word of prayer if you have a special need you'd like to make known by wave uplifted a hand I'm sure God sees each and every heart Heavenly Father Lord as we approach your word this morning we don't want to approach it in a way of Lord just a mental understanding but Lord we want your spirit to be here and to begin to reveal it to us Lord help us to know you or in a greater way when we leave here than when we came in Lord I pray for these requests that were made each uplifted hand there's something behind that some reason why they raised their hand Lord I pray you whatever's on their minds their hearts I pray you'd meet those needs today we believe you are an almighty God or we are nothing but you are everything the creator of the universe or you promised you would be here with us where two or three are gathered in your name we're here this morning and we're trusting you Lord to just just come in and meet ever need physical Financial spiritual whatever that need would be we believe that you are Jehovah Jireh or you can create something out of nothing and we thank you for that today Lord oh God be with us in this service today Lord I pray that every everything would be cast down that is unlike you move me out of the way Lord may may only your your word come out Lord not not any of me but God may your word be preached Lord and may we believe it because it is your word because your spirit quickens it to our hearts we pray we you we ask these things in the precious name of Jesus amen amen God bless you you can be seated this morning attitude is defined as a settled way of thinking or feeling about someone or something typically one that is reflected in a person's Behavior and even the world knows that attitude matters Thomas Jefferson says nothing can Thomas Jefferson says nothing can stop the man with the right mental attitude from achieving the goal nothing on Earth can help the man with the wrong mental attitude so we know that even even men in their own minds can think of that that if you have the right attitude towards something that you'll get a better response from it so I want to talk about attitude the right attitude and approach again because we want to have the right attitude don't we towards the word of God now uh and we begin to speak about this on Wednesday night I I thought about the deserts you know and how the birds fly across the desert the vulture flies across the desert as he goes he he goes across the bear and Wasteland of desert he's looking for something he he's in a certain posture a certain attitude what's he looking for dead flesh right and so he's looking for dead things and or nearly dead things that he can wait till they die and then he can have himself a feast so he flies across the desert looking for those things and partaking of those things and yet a hummingbird flies across the same desert and they travel hundreds of miles across the desert and a hummingbird is not looking for dead things but what they're looking for is bright flowers and each one because of their attitude what they're looking for what they are in their nature each one of them each one of them finds what they're looking for if you're in a desert so they say but brother Ben my life is bad and I've had so many bad things happen to me you might be in a desert but if you have the right attitude towards the things of God you'll be looking for things that'll help you things that will sustain you on your journey but if you're a buzzard to begin with in other words if if you don't have the right attitude if you if you've never been born again if you've never received Christ in your heart what's going to happen is you actually look for dead things and that's what you find sir amen now I I appreciate you back in the word this morning I just love you for that I appreciate it glad we we will have a church where people is not afraid to say Amen so brother Branham taught us this that he said God's word is a seed and if you put it in the right kind of ground of faith and treat it right come on I'd treat it right have the right kind of attitude about it you know the attitude that we have to have towards the promises of God is is totally to be totally wrapped up in the will of God you realize that when Jesus comes to the cross the promise of God for for him and for us had to be fulfilled by him going to the cross and many times the promises of God in our lives come through disappointment they come through hardship many times the Way Up Is Down and in order to reach a place of of prominence in order to reach a place where we're in the clear and everything's going good first you've got to go through some struggles and you've got to go through some trials anybody anybody identify with that today you got to go through some things in your life in order to reach a place where God begins to bless you and so Jesus had to come to a place where he said not my will but thine be done not what I think but what you think Lord let me be that person that that surrenders to the will of God completely in my life so he said it'll produce just what it is if it's for healing it'll produce healing salvation Salvation joy joy and every promise in the Bible is true he said and just remember you can take me to record for this that the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise of God will bring it to pass if you can take the right attitude towards that promise what did the woman say we preached about Wednesday night she said if I can butt Touch the Hem of His Garment the promise was that he was the Messiah and he would be a Healer but what she said was if I can just come in contact with him he don't have to speak to me it don't have to be a great thing it may not be an emotional thing but if I can Touch the Hem of His Garment I'll behold her attitude was such that I don't even have to make contact he don't even have to see me and I'll still be blessed who am I and that's the kind of attitude that she had now I we find that attitude in the early church that the Believers had that kind of attitude in Acts chapter 5 and verse 14. it says and Believers were the more added to the Lord multitudes both of men and women in so much that they brought forth the sick into the streets and laid them on beds and couches that at the least the shadow of Peter this is Faith Church that they just come by they had a need they had a real need now brother Branham says when you're in the line of duty and you have a need a real need God will meet that need yes you just speak it and go forward but now Believers were added to the Lord and and they begin to lay their sick on beds and couches so the shadow of Peter as he walked by now Peter never told them to do that right but just their attitudes was so strong towards the things of God but adjusted that they begin to just walk right into it and they actually receive their healing even though they didn't have any promise of doing that but they received their healing because of their attitude towards the things of God and the man of God so now it says There came also a multitude out of the Cities Round Up to Jerusalem bringing sick folks and them which were vexed with unclean spirits and they were healed everyone I believe every one of us could be healed this morning I believe every person in here can be saved I believe every person can be filled with the Holy Ghost why because if your attitude was towards the word was right he is here he can do anything all things are possible to them that believe so so in that first age they had that attitude in Acts 1911 it says God wrote brought special special Miracles by the hands of Paul so that from his body we're brought into the sick handkerchiefs or aprons and the diseases departed from them and the evil spirits went out of them so the attitude of the people was such that they said if I can just get a handkerchief I'll actually be well there was no power in the handkerchief there was no power in the clothes but it was their attitude towards the word of God Hallelujah no the woman in our text she had to overcome something very difficult she had to overcome who she was yeah I want us to listen this morning not because it's me saying it because all I want to do is help you you got to believe that if you don't believe that I can't help you but all I want to do is help somebody and if I can help you this morning be by the word of God so I want you to listen because it's the word of God I believe that it's the word of God now the woman she had to overcome something what what is it it was something very difficult it was who she was right she was a gentile and it was not a gentile age right they were not the elect people they were not the call of God they were not Grace had not yet been given to the Gentiles the gospel had not been sent to them so she had to overcome that fact in order for her daughter to be healed and so she comes to Jesus and Jesus refuses to pray for her daughter absolutely refuses it to pray for her daughter based on the impropriety of bestowing spiritual blessings I feel like this is just a little bit too loud for the game it Friday I don't I don't want to bust your eardrums this morning and I want to be able to preach so he says [Music] he said that you're you're people don't treat the things of God correctly now think deeply with me for just a moment he says he's not being racist right saying the Gentiles are dogs although it would have appeared to her that way right but he's saying the Gentiles don't treat sacred things with the proper respect sure they don't have the right attitude oh God towards the things of God you ever thought about that he's saying he's saying I can't take the children's bread this healing was for the children God's people God's elect he said I can't take the children's bread and give it to people who won't appreciate it won't even recognize where it come from yeah oh my God so and this was in accordance with this earlier teaching where he told the disciples give not that which is holy unto the dogs neither cast you ask you Euros Before Swine lest they trample them under their feet and turn again and Rend you so he's saying the what he calls for a dog he's saying he's not he's not just being mean but he's saying that these people do not understand the things of God they don't comprehend the things of God they don't appreciate the things of God now look dogs and Swine do not look and see where their blessings are coming from like the proverb that brother Branham told about the pig standing under the apple tree sit there and eat apples all day never once look up see where it was coming from he don't try to care for it he's not going to prune it he's not going to take care of it he just eats yeah he don't ever look see where oh my I don't want to be like that do you I want to look up and see the one that it came from so the Gentiles received the blessings of God by being human beings and not being wiped off the Earth right the long-suffering of God the rain falls on the just and the unjust they've built great civilization they built great a great countries and things and yet they never saw they never even looked at the things of God in fact they created Gods out of their own hands that they could worship and so it was the nature of Gentiles to trample the blessings of God under their feet you put a an untrained dog or a pig in the most beautiful place you can think of and they'll not act any differently than they would in the street or in a pigsty right because they don't know they don't appreciate it they just they don't appreciate your carpet right they don't appreciate it I see people take pigs in and if you have a pet pig that's fine I don't have I'm not preaching against pet pigs but hopefully you've trained it foreign because a pig doesn't have appreciation for Finer Things right you realize that's the way we're all born that's our name naturally we don't have an appreciation that's why many times God has to tell us no we have to go through some things oh God many times he don't just dump things in our lap because he wants us when we get it to be able to appreciate it in the right way so he said don't don't just give the holy things to people that won't appreciate it oh my now the message to the Gentiles was a message of Grace it had to be they hadn't been taught they didn't have a Moses they didn't have a Jeremiah they didn't have an Isaiah look at the at the history of God's people and their their prophets and things and still they rejected God still they rejected the word when it came but yet to the Gentiles they they never had that right they never had a Moses they never had they weren't promised to Messiah brother Brandon said the Messiah did not come to them he come to the Samaritans and to the Jews because he did not come to the Gentiles because they weren't looking for him he said that's why the sign of the Messiah had to wait until this day he said because now he'd been looking for him for two thousand years and he had to show his sign right but he did not show it to the Gentiles in that day because they weren't looking for him he said he only comes to those who are looking for him so the message to the Gentiles was a message of Grace listen to Jeremiah prophesying of it in Jeremiah 16 19. he said oh Lord my strength and my Fortress my refuge in the day of Affliction the Gentiles shall come unto thee from the ends of the Earth and shall say surely our fathers have inherited lies vanity and things were in there is no prophet I think we could all as Gentiles As Americans if we could put it that way today we can all say surely our fathers have inherited lies vanity and things oh you say we have a great civilization the Roman civilization was a great civilization the Chinese had a great civilization it was many great civilizations great Indian civilizations and different things that there were many great civilizations have come and gone this is a great I believe this country is the best country on the face of the Earth if you don't believe that I'll take you with me to Togo sometime or over in West Africa and you'll begin to appreciate the country that we have and yet all of our fathers yeah inherited lies the vanity and things wherein there is no prophet because the Gentile way was not to look to God but to make God's Jeremiah 16 and 20 shall a man make Gods unto himself and they are no gods he said therefore behold Hallelujah I will this once cause them to know amen I will cause him to know my hand and my might and they shall know that my name is the Lord so there's going to be a gentile dispensation where they'll know but this woman was outside of that Gentile dispensation and still received a blessing from God because she approached it in the right way she had the right attitude towards the things of God somehow she overcame her very nature she wasn't like the whole mind she wasn't like the other Gentiles why was that because she was a predestinated seed of God listen to me you aren't like all the rest of the people you weren't like all the rest of your family there was something different about you what was it it was the predestination of God it was the election of almighty God that made you the way that you are Hallelujah he never went to the Gentiles right while he was on the earth Jesus was walking on the Earth we were worshiping frogs and snails that's right he said buddy I'm proud to be an Anglo-Saxon from England I'm as English as they come by the way I looked at my DNA because it's all it's all from one place and my family tree just moves together across from Europe over here and I got to looking at that and as I began to look at the DNA and things I don't have very much to be proud of not in the flesh I don't have very much to be proud of but but I I my I'm a gentile I'm an Anglo-Saxon you know what the Anglo-Saxons were doing you talk about heathens right back in the day the Angels Angles fan everybody said well I won't have white pride or or whatever other color probably get myself in trouble here whatever color Pride you want we shouldn't have pride in our skin color we should have pride and Grace that God found us in spite of who we were huh but now these Anglo-Saxons walk around with clubs on their back you know killing each other tribal Warfare and and all of those things we weren't we weren't any better off than anybody else we were just like everybody else and so we were we were worshiping snails worshiping frogs worshiping the Sun worshiping the moon painting our faces carrying clubs come on not too different from today actually but Romans 9 30 says what shall we say then that the Gentiles which followed not after righteousness have attained to righteousness wow what kind of righteous even the righteousness which is of faith amen so the message and now you have been sent to the Gentiles when this woman's daughter got sick it she overcame the natural attitude of a gentile and her daughter was healed yes and nature is the hardest thing to overcome it's what we're it's our DNA it's what we're what's built into us it's just built into us and some people struggle with different things and and sometimes people struggle with a certain thing and you think well that person must be just a terrible person well they may be okay in every other area of their life but there's that one thing but the random said that the devil has one one punch coming and many times we uh we we we sit there and we just take that punch over and over again and so some people might struggle with sickness some people might struggle with unbelief some people might struggle with this side or the other but but it just runs kind of in the family it's just built in and so those are the things we have to overcome in order to receive from Christ and have the right attitude to come to God are you with them so far so so this is the hardest thing to overcome your natural attitude now think about this is the way you would act without thinking about it right yeah how you would treat people without thinking about it see this is why you have to be filled with the Holy Spirit yes because if you're not filled with God you're not you'll just display your natural attitude now some people are better than others in that sense like they act better than others but we all have some attitudes that are not according to the word all of us do yeah I some people are are more fiery some people are more laid back but we still have attitudes that are not according to the word yeah and we have to correct those by the word so we find that in the attitude passes through families brother random tells us that your attitude towards Christ will make a great impression on what your children will be yeah yeah oh my aren't you glad that aren't you glad you didn't just follow your mom and dad's attitude or your grandma and grandpa's attitude but you took an attitude towards Christ you say brother Ben I forgot a mess I've I've been involved in a lot of bad things but don't you realize you can change that today that the spirit of God can come in your life and change you and you can change your family history [Music] it's good hallelujah what was brother Stewart said something that last week that that just stuck with me he said Ruth overcame the fact that her it was in her family DNA put into my own words but it was in her family DNA to turn back because she was a lullaby and the mother of the moabites was lost wife who turned back and become a pillar of salt and yet when the opportunity came to turn back Ruth did not why she was predestined by God [Music] aren't you glad she was predestined to Redemption why didn't you turn back when others turned back why didn't you leave the message when others left why didn't you quit being a Christian when others quit why are you still here this morning because of the predestined elect power of God it's a seed of God inside of you that made the difference family would have turned back you people would have turned back you were a gentile she was a gentile but she said your people be my people your God will be my God oh God let me let me be led by the god of the Bible Lord let me go where you go let me let me be a part of what you're doing so Ruth overcame her family attitude and orpa continued turning back see the difference now we're called and chosen by God to overcome those things in our natural disposition which are against the word so we can have an attitude of humble expectation as we talked about Wednesday night towards the promises of God that's the attitude that we should have so first Peter two one let's look at that for just a moment he's speaking to Gentiles here he said wherefore laying is tight on malice all guile and hypocrisies and envies and all evil speakings as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word that you may grow thereby it was so be that you have tasted that the Lord is gracious to whom coming is unto a living Stone disallowed indeed of men but chosen of God and precious so we weren't the only ones who were Outcast he was an outcast he said disallowed of men but chosen of God and precious ye also as Lively stones are built up a spiritual house and holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ I love that wherefore also it is contained in the scripture behold I lay in Zion a Chief Cornerstone elect precious and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded unto you therefore unto you which believe he is precious he has great value to you in spite of you being a gentile in spite of you being an American just like everybody other American in spite of you being just like anybody else but to you who believe he is precious unto them which be disobedient the stone which the builders disallowed the same is made the head of the corner a stone of stumbling a rock of offense even to them would stumble at the word being disobedient were unto also they were appointed but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation A peculiar people that you should show forth the Praises of him who have called you out of Darkness into his marvelous life which in time past were not a people but are now the people of God aren't you glad for the grace of God today which had not obtained Mercy but now have obtained Mercy see my ancestors your ancestors most of you most of you come I I'm assuming this morning from gentiles and God Saves both Gentiles and Jews during the Gentile age if they believe by faith and come according to Faith but the Jews were saved as a nation but Gentiles and Jews during the Gentile dispensation are both saved if they come to Christ by faith so but the Gentiles did not place a proper value on sacred things the Jews were taught to approach god with reverence even to the point of when they would come into the holy of holies the high priests the most the person who was the highest in the land as far as this walk is the way he held himself he was a good man but when he went into the holy of holies he had a a skirt that had a bell and a pomegranate on it yeah right and when he went in and he moved his skirts would would ring because the pomegranate would ring against the belt and the reason they did that because they approached the things of God with such fear and reverence that they knew that if he did something just a little bit wrong he would actually not make it he would he would he would die right there in the holy of holies so in the presence of that light in the presence of the Shekinah in the presence of the shoe bread and the holy things he he if when he moved every move had to be right and you knew that he was still alive because he was making noise right so but he would move and he'd make noise and so that was their attitude towards holy things the Gentiles didn't care the Gentiles idiotic and Antiochus epiphanes I think I'm saying that right if I'm not brother Justin will correct me later but Antiochus epiphanes he was he was a man who set himself up to be God he was a Greek and when he took over when he took over uh the land of Israel when the Greeks ruled there his father had taken him and they let the Jews continue to Worship in the temple and do the things that they did but when he took over he decided he was going to squelch that so he goes down to Jerusalem and takes pigs and offers Pig blood swine Blood on the altar of God absolutely had no had absolutely no regard for the holy things of God he was a gentile that's just the way they were the Romans had no regard for the holy things of God when Titus coming to Jerusalem in 70 A.D when he comes into Jerusalem he actually destroys the temple they burn the temple to the ground and they come in and take out the sacred things out of the temple and they take them back to Rome and they take they take the menorah and the table the shoe bread you can see them on titus's Arch they're in Rome where they took them back which still stands today they took them back and they actually paraded it through the streets and the fact is that no one had ever seen that but the high priest so it goes from the Jews treating it with such reverence that no one had ever seen it to the Gentiles take it and parade it through the streets of the biggest city in the Earth you see the difference that attitude still exists today people mock the things of God and we shouldn't do that church right right even if we don't understand it we shouldn't do it right brother Brandon talks about those some boys were mocking communion they went up and drank whiskey and and things in their room and said this is communion took it and two of them end up in the insane asylum and one of them ended up dead I don't say that would happen to you but I'll say this if it doesn't it's just the goodness of God giving you a space to repent you can't disrespect God you've got to respect God he said if you don't believe it just keep still keep away from it either do that or come reverently and respect it don't make fun of people in the spirit don't talk about people that's worshiping in the spirit of God let them alone the Bible doesn't tell us see if you think about this now I want us to I want us to dig deep here and begin to think about our attitude towards the sacred things of God because it's our natural way for the Isaac to be to just treat them as nothing right but when the spirit of God comes in our life we begin to treat church as different we we treat the Bible differently we treat the message of the hour differently yes right not because there's any Holiness in the book itself but because we believe the word that's on it right we believe that it's not anything about a picture or a sign or anything like that it's not a name it's not a person but we believe we reference God and we worship Him in spirit and in truth yeah so we treat the things of God with reverence now the Bible doesn't just tell us to love God how many know this the Bible doesn't just tell us to love God he tells us how to love God right Mark 12 29 Jesus to ask Jesus what are the greatest Commandments in the law and Jesus answered him to the first of all the Commandments is hear o Israel the Lord our God is one Lord and thou shalt love the Lord thy God he doesn't stop there with all that heart with all thy soul with all thy mind with all thy strength this is the first commandment he said brother Ben why do you you do the things that you do why do the people do the things that they do not because I tell them to do it not because even a prophet tells us to do it we do it because we value the things of God we value the word of God we want to do what God Said we want to live as close to the word of God as we can if you don't feel that way that's fine you go you go live your life before us let's live just as close to God as we can huh love the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all thy soul with all thy mind with all thy strength in every area of your life he said this is the first commandment and the second is like namely this Thou shalt Love Thy Neighbor he tells us how to do that too as thyself so love God with all of your heart all your strength all your mind and then love your neighbor to who is your neighbor who is your neighbor everyone you have an opportunity to do good into that was Samaritan he said who was neighbor to the Samaritan right it's everyone you have an opportunity to do something good for you do it as you have opportunity right we don't always have opportunity many times I wish I could do things for people and I can't do it I just don't have time and you experience the same thing you're a human being but when you do have opportunity do good yeah the people and sometimes doing good to people is corrective sometimes doing good to people is it requires you to to say something to people that I mean they don't want to hear but but you still have to you still have to do that because you want to see good come out of their life so let's put it in other words like this do not love God in a casual way yeah I'm gonna let that sink in a minute God casual way now in all of your attitudes towards God the all of your approaches to God we live in an age where everything is casual and I don't mind that so much in the dress and things like that it's not what I'm talking about I'm talking about in our attitudes towards the things of God talking about I'm talking about in our in our worship and our praise and in our attitude towards church itself towards the house of God towards the Bible our attitude towards one another do not love God in a casual way look at John chapter 12. now Jesus at least twice in his ministry he was anointed for death he was anointed for death very similar stories but this was actually different from the woman at least it appears to be different from the woman who watched Jesus feet with her hair who you remember was a prostitute a woman of ill a repute and she come and washed his his feet and brother man who tells the story so well but there's another place where Jesus is Anointed in John chapter 12 and verse 1 and he's actually anointed by Mary Lazarus sister and so it says in Jesus six days before the Passover came to Bethany where Lazarus was which had been dead whom he raised from the dead there they made him a supper and Martha served but Lazarus I love this was one of them that sat at the table with him I just love that brother Bill Jesus was coming to dinner just an everyday occurrence but there was something special about it the man that had been raised from the dead a man whose life had been forever altered by the word from that man's lift was sitting right beside him eating too how are you it'd be hard to deny well that Jesus was the Messiah it would be hard to deny because here was a man who was dead let me tell you today when we sit together we sit here and we sit around round people who have been raised from the dead I'm not talking about naturally although that could happen I'm not talking about that I'm talking about being raised from dead trespasses and sins you've come from the dead go ahead Lazarus if you want to worship worship you got a right to yeah you were dead but you lived today you say brother Ben why do you put all your heart into it why do you put up and you don't have to you don't have to do that to be a Christian maybe not but I want to love him the most I can because I recognize I'm sitting at the table and I have no right to be here brother Danny I should have been dead I should have been passed over I should have been rotten away amen Lazarus might have sat there and thought I should have been dead already I was rotten away it was four days late but he came and spoke to me yeah from shouting come on now reach are you with me now I'm not gonna put down on Lazarus or call him names because he worships God why he sat right down at the table and he said oh my I was dead but now I'm living how many can say Amen to that today I was dead but now I'm alive go ahead Lazarus worship God oh God Lazarus set at the table we don't I don't think we comprehend what it means to sit down with one another and eat a meal or sit down together in church I was dead but now I'm alive and of course that family was so appreciative of what Jesus did they didn't treat him just like any other person they didn't treat him like they did at Simon's house he went down to Simon's house they didn't kiss him they didn't annoy him but they were so appreciative of what he did that Mary comes out since then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard which is pure nard which comes from India and even today to get pure nard from India it costs something like 800 for a little bitty vial of pure nard from India because it's so rare and it's grown up in the mountains and they had to ship it you can imagine that day what it took to get it there yeah yeah and so it says a pound of ointment of spiking are very costly and anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped his feet with her hair and the house was filled with the odor of the ointment oh God speightner had a unique fragrance and the presence of its aroma was an indication that the very best had been offered when you walked into the house and you smelled spitnered you knew that only the very best all that our church services would be like that all that our homes would be like that that when when we come to worship God that it's not just any old thing it's not just any old service but it's our very best she took her very best and she give it to Jesus she didn't just give it to him she poured it on his head she anointed his feet another place and said she poured it on his head she broke the bottle the house was filled with the odor of the ointment Mark says some of those presidents were saying indignantly to one another why this waste of perfume it could have been sold for more than a Year's wages and the money given to the poor and they rebuked her harshly Judas had a calculator in his hand he did a man who knew the price of everything and the value of nothing and he instantly calculated the waste in terms of today's economy something like 25 to 30 thousand dollars someone come to you and they said I won't buy some perfume for the church make it smell good because Jesus is there think about it now if you come to me and said brother Ben I'm gonna buy some 25 000 perfume I'd say you don't have to do that because the thing of greater value to him it's the hand yeah of a redeemed child of God The Voice of a redeemed child of God who has been blessed beyond measure yes well I hope you hear me this morning you've been we've been blessed beyond measure we weren't supposed to be here but we're here we're seated at the table and the Hand of us redeemed child of God means so much more to him yes than the very best spikner see they tried to tell her oh she should do that she shouldn't worship like that she shouldn't get involved in church like that she shouldn't give everything like that she shouldn't do that yes sir and what Jesus said he when they asked him about it he said she did what she could oh I love that you may not be able to do what somebody else can do but you coming this morning you did what you could just to bury your sister Chris sitting back there you did what you could by coming to the house of God that's all we can do sometimes just the strength to come to the house of God we did what we could those of you who are sitting there watching this morning you're doing what you can you're sitting here this morning do what you can if you can raise your hand raise your hand if you can lift your voice lift your voice do what you can since she did what she could she could never repay him for bringing her brother back she could never repay him for the gift of Resurrection I could never repay him for the resurrection that's happened in my life what a resurrection that was but what a resurrection this is I could never repaint for the message of the hour but I'll do what I can it is within my power she said to buy the best ointment and anoint him with it so I will not give him less you see the attitude towards the word towards the holy things of God she didn't go up to the five and nine store she didn't go to the discount store and find a come on she didn't go to the discount store and find the the smells like spiknerd she didn't go down and find the the ax cologne laughs walk in the house spread that stuff I know some young people think that smells good but one of these days you'll grow up foreign Services stale come on oh well what's the point of worshiping today just you know for God nothing dead oh my God whatever the best is that we have we need to give that to God yeah if the best we have is what we're doing that's wonderful but what if we could do more and we don't I'm not talking about money today I'm talking about our life to him it means way more to him than money I don't need your money the church doesn't need your money we're going to make it because we're we're called by God to make it right you do what you feel is right but the church is not out for your money but what we're trying to do is build children women and men of God children of God the bride of Christ the edify the bride of Christ at the end time we're called to do that and I will not apologize for giving our best to God if we can provide a nice Sanctuary for you to for you to Worship in I think we ought to do it I want to apologize for that brother Madam said there's nothing too good for Jesus giving her best we may not be able to give him with the church down the road will but we can give him our best we can do our best he said he said whatever we give him it ought to be our best he said there's nothing too good for him give him everything you got your life your soul your being your time all that you have give it to him whatever we give him it ought to be our best we shouldn't go down to the discount store and give him part of our time when we happen to not be doing something we'll go to church that's not what we give God we give God our best why we've been redeemed from that Gentile way of thinking we're coming like the woman she said I'm willing to even eat the crumbs that fall from the master's table I'm gonna give God my best whatever we give him we should I believe we should give him our best if we're going to play instruments we ought to we ought to learn how to play it well give God our best right my son's learning to play different instruments and and brother Wendell said something that because he's a musician I'm really not but brother Wendell's a musician but Wendell Martin and he said if a young man gets starting doing something he needs to focus on one thing why is that because you can give God your best sure you want to give God your best at something it if you're going to do it if you're going to run the video room give him your best I thank God for the people that we have to do that and giving my kids a break every now and then I appreciate that but if you're going to do it give God your best if you're going to be a deacon give God your best brother Brown so we should put our best people on the Deacon board we whatever we do whatever our trustees everything that we do we ought to give God our best I don't mean we have to be extravagant it just means we need to do whatever we can whatever we can do we should do if there's trash on the parking lot we ought to pick it up whatever we can goes for me and you and everybody else whatever we can do we should do yeah are you with me this morning I'm preaching to you this to you because you do that I I feel like most of you do that but if there's an ounce more that I can give Let Me Be Inspired this morning to give him my best why do it halfway let's give him our best let's make sure there's an atmosphere up here every service be my best and if there's a whatever position we find ourselves then we ought to do our best in that position not halfway but do our best and if if we see that if if I see that somebody else can help I you know I don't have these other preachers in I can preach three times a week but we do we use these Ministries because I believe they're some of the best God's Got we give the church the best and sometimes we give them room to become the best right because they've got to work in that office until they can get better yeah yeah right so we do that we let our young people play and sing and do things because we want them to become the best it's not about me it's about God it's about him getting the best worship out of the service and and I would say this as we move along now it shouldn't be just in our church it should be in our homes we give God first place in our home first place in our work first place among the people and then they'll see but Robert what kind of a Christian we are when they go looking for God they'll ask us right now look when we do wrong we should do our best to repent yeah think about the story of the Pharisee and the public and the Pharisee walks up there to God he gotten accustomed to Sacred things he was a priest he could come up to the temple he felt good about it he walks into church and says bless God I thank God I'm not like this other person you ever felt that way secretly I won't make you raise your hand but come to church and say I'm a pretty good person you know thank God that I'm not like all these other people out here you know but by the grace of God but for the grace of God Apostles by the grace of God I am what I am perishly walks up here and says I give tithes of all that I possess he's boasting to God of what he does and the public and the tax collector I love this he comes before God but he gives God his best in Repentance he gives God his best in Repentance he comes to God Paris is closed and spice himself on the breast and he says he says I'm not worthy to come before you Lord I'm not worthy to stand in this house but Lord if you would please forgive me and Jesus said which one of them went away Justified the Publican did the Publican went away Justified because God saw his attitude and approach towards the holy things of God Revelation 3 18 we live in an age where people don't repent it's hard for people to repent because they don't see that they're wrong we live in the age of laodicea in Revelation 3 and he tells that age he said I counsel thee to buy of me gold try it in the fire that thou mayest to be rich white Rhema to tell me is to be clothed at the shame of thy nakedness do not appear anoint thine eyes with eyes have the dumbass see as many as I love I rebuke and Chase and be zealous therefore and repent I'm gonna skip down brother Brandon talks about intellectual Giants coming around to prove that all this shouting and saying amen going to the altar breaking up because of your sins that it's just all emotion he said that's a scientific giant intellectual giant saying there's no such thing woke up dry eyed what's that mean no no there's no heart in it I love what brother Daryl Ward says he says sometimes God squeezes the heart and the juice comes out your eyes huh some people aren't criers I understand that but when you approach the things of God there ought to be something about you yeah that just and everybody worships in their own way everybody comes to God in their own way but there's got to be something serious about it something sincere about it something real about it not just a dried confession say I'll join this church and I believe Jesus Christ the son of God he said Satan does too no sign he's saved it takes more than that it takes a New Birth come on it takes the word it takes a new birth not just saying that it takes something that happens in here makes you different second Corinthians 7 10 the Bible says Godly sorrow worketh repentance I get worried about people who don't know how to repent because you're going to do something wrong all of us are The Herald at some point I know this is shocking to people I'll pick on brother Harold at some point where the hell is going to do something he has to repent of right he's been in the way in the message a long time decades it's been on a church view but every once in a while the herald I know you have to talk to God and say God forgive me I did something today I shouldn't have done I said something today I shouldn't have said if you don't know how to repent yeah it's a problem and if you come to God if we even if we come to our spouses like that if you come to your spouse after doing something that you shouldn't have done and it's flip it and it's arrogant you're not going to get forgiveness you're sure not going to get forgetfulness why because because you you didn't you don't know how to repent and it's hard because that's the Gentile way it's just built into our family not to be able to repent but God help me today God help me today to be able to still call out to God when I'm in trouble when I have a need to be able to be like David and say God forgive me oh God see the gospel even has to be sowed in tears you know that even when he preached the gospel we don't just preach it we don't just say it it'll just come out and scream at people right this kind of mean something to us I've told people I don't care how emotional you are in the Pulpit that's not a sign of anointing right that's not if Jesus sat down and spoke gracious words right but what is it there's something if you don't care about it the people won't care about it right if they can't see that you care about what you're saying how can I get you interested in what I'm selling if I was selling something if I'm not interested in it myself during the pandemic I went to look at a new vehicle and I went to one dealer and you know how everything was there's like three cars on the lot he saw sized me up and saw I didn't maybe wasn't the best customer he would ever have and and so he sized me up I might have been better than he thought but he sized me up and said and you know what so we don't really have anything for you I've never been to a Salesman like that this is a Car Lot usually it's like flies man they just they just swarm you ever drove around A Car Lot you gotta remember the building you sell cars didn't you you you did and you and Joel that's why well they get along so well I just realized that bless God God can even say the car dealer but but you take a uh you take a a used car they swarm you like that this guy wasn't interested I said well I'm not interested in buying what you got either huh you think somebody don't that's not interested in his Ford I'm not interested in the Ford I go down to Toyota and see what they got all right if you're going to sow the gospel sow it in tears show it in tears show it with some heart yeah oh God help us today I'm preaching to myself tell people about the message but you can take it or leave it and convinced but the Bible says Psalm 126-5 they that sow in tears shall reap in joy he that goeth forth you got somebody that you really care about you got somebody that you got on your heart Lord I'd like to see this person turn to God I'd like to see them really saved really born again if you've got some of you in your heart and you're thinking of somebody right now somebody in your heart don't have to have discernment to say that it's just the truth you got something in your heart you say I'd like to see them saved well what do you do yeah sometimes you've got to you've got to express that and you've got to say Lord help me to sow in tears help me to sow in tears in my prayer closet help me to sow in tears at the altar Elman is so in tears oh God help me to help me to put everything I've got into it help me to be a real Christian and if I become a real Christian that's going to help that person be how can they be saved if I've not really committed my own life to God let me commit my own life and God will take care of the people that I love come on do you believe that today I can I have to have faith for myself first and then I have faith for my family but they'll be okay they they're so in tears shall reap enjoy he that goeth forth and weep is bearing precious seed he knows how precious the seed is the farmer in ancient times he couldn't go down the market and buy more seed seed was all that he had it was his life so he did not carry it lightly he carried it as precious seed this is my life and he sowed it in such a way that he believed it would come up he didn't sow among the weeds and the thorns and things like that but he sowed it until ground because he believed it would come up he took care of it he went forth weeping bearing precious seed in the hardship in the In the Heat of the day in the toil of the hour so that he could come doubtless come again with rejoicing bringing his shoes with him if you don't put in the work you can't reap the benefit just the law of God you blame me but George Whitfield said this you blame me for weeping how can I help it when you will not weep for yourselves if you we live in a hardened age people are so hard they see things and do things and just don't bother them but if you want weep George Whitfield said let me weep for you yeah yeah you will not weep for yourselves though your Immortal Souls are on the verge of Destruction Paul said in Acts 20 31 therefore watch and remember by the space of three years I cease not to warn everyone night and day with tears taught us he said don't worry about the tears they won't hurt nothing come on come on that don't hurt see he that goeth for sowing in tears will doubt this return again bringing precious cheese see God wants us to repent because his attitude towards us is that we're valuable you're gonna have about five more minutes I want to turn this just a little bit you see sometimes it's hard for us as Gentiles to see ourselves with any value because Gentiles didn't value life they take their babies and just throw them out by the side of the road but it's the Jewish tradition the the judeo-christian is what we call today tradition that causes even our nation to Value life that's where it comes from but the Communists and things like they don't value life just a number you're just an oh God just a number but sometimes it's hard for us to Value ourselves in the proper way yeah yeah it's hard for us to see that we are valuable to God Jesus taught his disciples are not too Sparrow sold for a farthing one of them shall not fall on the ground without your father but the very hairs of your head are all numbered he said you're more value than many sparrows Paul has to remind the Gentiles they were valuable in First Corinthians 3 16 he said no you're not you are the temple of God remember the Gentiles would come into the temple and would just offer swine and everything else but Jews understood that the temple of God was holy and Paul's trying to teach the Gentiles he said don't you know that your body is the temple of God oh God that the spirit of God well is in you now think about that you are valuable to God he chose you as his Dwelling Place our natural inclination is to think of ourselves as worthless and hopeless but you are so much more than that if I could just get you to see that today you are not hopeless you are not you don't have to do anything to earn God's favor listen you don't have to work you don't have to go out and be a great Supernatural hero to be worth something to God you don't have to do anything you cannot earn salvation you cannot earn your blessing but it comes from God so we give him our best because of who we are and what he's done we love him because he first loved us Penny man defiled the temple he says him shall God destroy for the temple of God is Holy which Temple you are Jesus his attitude towards the church was to knock at the door even on the laodocian church who had put him out and would never open the door to him but he said behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and we'll sup with him and he with me what is his attitude towards us what should our attitude be towards other people we should we should season our words with salt God help me today you know what that means be careful that everything you say even if it's on the internet is seasoned with salt because you might be keeping someone away from the kingdom of God you might cause an unbeliever to take a bad attitude towards you which will keep them out of the Kingdom so we season everything we say with the understanding of the power of God's vested in us we are the temples of God what is his attitude towards us Jesus was born for one purpose that was for God to manifest himself through that body God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself he was a body that was made physical that men and women could see what he thought and his expression to the people in his gratefulness and his attitude towards all mankind he expressed it through Jesus Christ the Bible said for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life for God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved this is his attitude towards you and the prophet of God taught us he cannot change his attitude oh I love that he cannot change he is not a man that he should change he cannot change his attitude when he said I know the thoughts I think towards you nothing you could do could change that attitude he oh God he cannot change his attitude he's still Jehovah I don't care how many he says that he changes people have changed but he hasn't changed what is his attitude towards us let me just read this and I'm done Romans 8 31 what should we say then to these things if God before us who can be against us he despair not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things someone say all things who shall lay anything to the charge of God so that it is God that justifies who is he that condemneth it is Christ that died yeah rather than his risen again who is even at the right hand of God who also maketh intercession for us who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation under stress or persecution or famine or nakedness or Peril or sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are a countless sheep for the slaughter nay and all these things we are more than conquered through him that loved us this is his attitude towards us you are not forsaken you are not despised you are not a cult you are not what the world says you are you are the bride The Virtuous bride of Jesus Christ Hallelujah I'm persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels or principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come musicians go ahead and come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord he doesn't love us because we're deacons or trustees or song leaders he doesn't love us because we go to church he doesn't love us he loves us before we ever did any of that he loves us he loves you he wants to make you this Temple that's his attitude towards you I'll ask you what is your attitude towards him he cares do you care with every head bowed every eye closed this morning have you approached him with humble expectation believing in what he said in John 6 37 all that the father giveth me shall come to me and him that cometh to me how will he know Wise cast out [Music] I may be stupid they do stupid things I may have a pass all of us have a past of some kind all of us may have messed up at some point in our lives [Music] the father told me he cometh to me all the father giveth me shall come me in him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out stands with open arms his attitude towards you is to receive you to make you a temple of the Living God what is your attitude towards him so I I don't want to be like that I you know you the people are different and holding us in their lifestyle and things but why do we do that not because some Creed tells us too we don't have any written statement only the scriptures no creeds no law but love no Creed but Christ no book but the Bible why do we do those things because [Music] we want to give our best to God and I trust that you will this morning if you maybe you've never done that you'd like to raise your hand Be Remembered in prayer for any reason this morning I understand there's some maybe the devil try to tell you you're not valuable to God but you are you're worth something to God your worth is not what you do your worth isn't Who You Are just acknowledge that today and say brother Ben would you pray for me I I want to be I want to have the right value on spiritual things I want to overcome the God bless that hand bless that hand oh I want to overcome

of grace we believe that you are a merciful god that you are a God who loves us you called us into this glorious truth of the hour we thank you for that but we pray that you will season our life season our words oh God season our attitudes Lord changes so God help us to realize when we're when we're in the public Lord we're we're presenting ourselves to the people as God many of them will

it's already done my heart's full this morning brother Robert you don't know what you did today a sister Millie sartin asked us to be baptized today we had the baptism pool ready for somebody else God that's the way God works that God laid it on that little girl's heart to be baptized today he has a way he has a way God has a way a method by which he works so we filled the pool today and we're disappointed that no one came but but now there's fruit of it because it really and I pray that God would fill every one of these children with the Holy Spirit at a young age they would never have to experience what some of us had to experience but if they do they do come on they would make a mistake they would know there's a God connected with something as a child there's a God that can come back to there's a reality of a living God and you love him today amen let's sing that I've already made it and and we'll go but Alan will have us go to the baptism service the way that we usually do God bless you this morning praise the Lord the Battle Is Over Victory is one it's already done I'm already healed oh I'm already here Hallelujah I'm already here praise the Lord the Battle Is Over Victory is one it's already done give me your lord a handclap or praise [Applause] brother Ben time to get ready for the baptism let's sing one more song and we'll dismiss during that song We'll see let the worshipers arise when you're dismissed just if you would just go directly to the fellowship hall the baptismal set up there it's so just as soon as you're dismissed if you'll go there father I see that you were Drawing the Line in the Sand I wanna be standing on your side holding your hand so let your kingdom come let it live in me this is my prayer this is [Music] to the king [Music] oh let the worshipers arise [Music] surrender to the king oh Father I hear it growing louder the song of your redeem [Music] listen to our King with the worshipers arise amen you're free to be dismissed in the baptism let the sons and the daughters see I'm surrendered [Music] I surrender to the king all of the worshipers arise [Music] I'm surrendering my own our surrender to the king foreign
