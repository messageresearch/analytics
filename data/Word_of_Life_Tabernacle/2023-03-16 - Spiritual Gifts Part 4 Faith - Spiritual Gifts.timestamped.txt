[47:39] these verses again we don't want to lose
[47:41] our place
[47:43] [Music]
[47:46] he says now there are diversities of
[47:48] gifts but the Same Spirit
[47:50] there are differences of administrations
[47:52] but the same Lord
[47:55] there are diversities of operations but
[47:57] it is the same God which worketh all in
[48:01] all
[48:02] but the manifestation of the spirit is
[48:04] given to every man to profit with all
[48:07] for to one is given by the spirit the
[48:09] word of wisdom to another the word of
[48:11] knowledge by The Same Spirit
[48:13] to another Faith by The Same Spirit to
[48:15] another the gifts of healing by The Same
[48:17] Spirit another the working of Miracles
[48:20] to another prophecy to another
[48:22] Discerning of spirits to another diverse
[48:25] kinds of tongues to another the
[48:27] interpretation of tongues but all these
[48:29] worketh that one and the self Same
[48:32] Spirit and dividing to every man
[48:35] severally as he will amen I pray the
[48:39] Lord with that is blessing to the word

[49:03] you're near 30 because now you and I
[49:06] both are closer to 40. so I don't know
[49:08] how that make should make you feel but
[49:11] not good
[49:13] but the bill feels good though
[49:16] about it you made it it's another day
[49:18] right another Victory I guess that's
[49:19] what it is another Victory I'll be gone
[49:23] this weekend I made a commitment to try
[49:26] to go to this Camp every year by the
[49:28] Wendell's and and take my kids and I'm
[49:30] trying to do that with them maybe next
[49:33] year we'll be able to take a bus or a or
[49:36] a little at least a van a load of kids
[49:38] I'd like to get everybody involved in
[49:40] that it's it's pretty close uh not five
[49:43] or six hours over there so it'd be nice
[49:45] if maybe some more of us could go but
[49:48] that's what we're going to be doing uh
[49:49] this weekend brother Stewart will be
[49:51] here brother Joe Reynolds will be here
[49:53] in the evening service and then uh if
[49:56] I'm not back on Wednesday night but Joel
[49:58] would be preaching he'll be preaching
[49:59] either way but uh we may we may stay
[50:02] away for a few days I was going to tell
[50:04] you as well our Easter services uh this
[50:07] year are going to be a little different
[50:08] I'm going to be going to Togo the Lord
[50:11] willing on Easter they've asked me to
[50:13] preach that he's been after me for the
[50:15] John bedok has been after me to preach
[50:17] that meeting for several uh several
[50:19] years and we've not been able to do it
[50:22] and but this year it just had it on my
[50:24] heart to do it to go and and be a
[50:27] blessing to those people and I'm so glad
[50:28] you're a church that would let me do
[50:30] that and and thankful for that but what
[50:33] we're going to do is move our Easter
[50:35] services as far as the dinner I don't
[50:37] want to miss the dinner
[50:38] so we're gonna have our Easter dinner
[50:40] the week before Easter so remember that
[50:43] that's just a couple of weeks away just
[50:45] a few weeks away so I remember that
[50:47] we'll have our Easter dinner and it's
[50:48] like we normally would on Easter and
[50:50] I'll preach my Easter Sermon the week
[50:52] before and then on Easter Sunday we'll
[50:54] just have one service
[50:56] that Sunday and another brother will be
[50:58] preaching but we'll have uh we'll have
[51:00] that service and then you can have
[51:02] Easter with your family isn't God good
[51:04] to us don't you love this time of year
[51:07] amen see God moving we've been talking
[51:10] about the gifts we're going to talk
[51:11] about faith tonight and uh this this is
[51:14] the good part we really in I really
[51:16] enjoy this I enjoy studying on this I'm
[51:19] not doing this because of any other
[51:22] church or any other Ministry I'm doing
[51:25] this because it's the word of God and
[51:26] and I felt led to do it and and so we
[51:29] want to make that clear tonight I uh
[51:31] what you said brother Ben what do you
[51:32] preach where do you get what you preach
[51:34] we get it from the Bible and we get it
[51:36] from the message of the hour and that's
[51:38] the only place that we get it and we're
[51:41] not a denomination here in the message
[51:43] of the hour we we don't have anybody
[51:45] over us telling us what to preach I
[51:47] don't even tell these brothers what to
[51:49] preach but they just preach what's on
[51:50] their heart so that's what we want to do
[51:53] I sold out to this message a long time
[51:55] ago and I'm not not about to turn around
[51:57] I'm not about to turn back we've we have
[52:00] a message to preach and and whether one
[52:03] person shows up for a hundred we still
[52:05] preach the same message and whether
[52:07] whether uh whether the church comes or
[52:09] goes whatever happens people will come
[52:11] and go but this message stays the same
[52:13] because it's the message of the hour and
[52:15] so we're thankful for that tonight amen
[52:18] so now uh there's spiritual gifts that
[52:21] fall on the body and Paul groups these
[52:23] in the scriptures that we read groups
[52:26] them like this there's two word gifts
[52:28] which are wisdom and knowledge and then
[52:30] there are three Faith gifts which is
[52:33] Faith healing and miracles and then for
[52:35] what I call prophecy gifts which are
[52:37] prophecy discernment tongues and
[52:40] interpretation and these are spiritual
[52:43] gifts that fall among the body in other
[52:46] words when the Holy Ghost moves these
[52:48] gifts move in the body so what we want
[52:51] is for the Holy Ghost to move we're not
[52:53] looking for a particular gift
[52:56] but uh over the years the Pentecostals
[52:59] uh cabbage down on tongues because
[53:02] tongues was the most visible gift but
[53:05] it's also the gift that's easiest to
[53:07] mimic
[53:08] right but it is the most visible gift
[53:11] because you know whether or not
[53:12] somebody's spoken tongues you don't
[53:14] always know about some of these other
[53:16] gifts we could have these gifts in the
[53:18] body many of them and no one would ever
[53:20] know and I think it's meant to be that
[53:22] way in large part because of the Easter
[53:26] to edify the body not to vindicate a
[53:28] particular Ministry or a particular
[53:30] person
[53:31] let me understand that tonight that
[53:33] that's not what the gifts are for the
[53:35] gifts are not to say that I have a gift
[53:37] or someone else does not have a gift or
[53:40] we're A Gifted church and another church
[53:42] is not that's not what the gifts are for
[53:43] the gifts are given for the purpose of
[53:46] edification of the body and they can
[53:49] fall on anyone in the body male or
[53:51] female
[53:53] these spiritual gifts can fall on a male
[53:55] or female their their subject to the
[53:59] ministry of the word the spirit of the
[54:01] Prophet is subject to the prophet and if
[54:03] their spoken gifts and we'll get more
[54:05] into this later but they're to be judged
[54:07] by two or three before given to the body
[54:10] so we all understand that that that's
[54:12] Elementary let's talk about faith
[54:14] tonight
[54:15] brother random makes a distinction
[54:16] distinction between this gift of faith
[54:19] and what he calls a direct gift
[54:21] direct gift and so he said faith is a
[54:24] gift of itself he said you may have a
[54:26] portion of it but there is a gift of
[54:28] faith so you can have a portion of it
[54:30] but there is a gift of faith he said
[54:32] just like some of you people anoint to
[54:34] sick and pray for them and you have a
[54:36] result he said that isn't a gift of
[54:38] healing that is a portion of Faith he
[54:41] said but that isn't a direct gift of
[54:42] healing there's only one direct gift of
[54:44] healing there's only one direct gift of
[54:46] faith there's only one direct gift of
[54:48] Miracles and so forth now we know that
[54:50] the Branham did not operate from a gift
[54:54] you have to give me a minute to get
[54:55] warmed up I'm like an old motor an old
[54:57] engine my voice doesn't warm up for a
[55:00] while but brother Branham didn't operate
[55:02] from a gift of faith that falls in the
[55:05] body but he had uh he had Faith he had
[55:08] there were Miracles that were worked
[55:10] there was many things that were done but
[55:12] his guest gift was different I want to
[55:14] highlight that again tonight now brother
[55:16] Branham says this he said I believe that
[55:18] these Ministries that we have today
[55:19] across the world he said one different
[55:22] from the other one he talks about uh
[55:24] looking on the television seeing Oral
[55:27] Roberts had a TV show he said I seen an
[55:30] oral praying for a little sick baby from
[55:31] up in Canada had a bad eye he said I
[55:34] believe the parents was Catholic he said
[55:36] brother Robertson is real way of Faith
[55:38] he slammed his his hand out on the
[55:40] little baby and prayed for it and the
[55:42] little baby was healed how many have
[55:44] ever watched an Oral Roberts prayer line
[55:47] uh one or two other people they're on
[55:49] YouTube you can go watch it it's a
[55:52] pretty interesting thing to watch it's
[55:54] completely different from Brother
[55:55] branham's prayer lines
[55:57] completely different the way that he did
[55:59] it he would sit in the chair and they'd
[56:01] bring the person up and he'd read off a
[56:02] card and
[56:03] and say well now you've said this is
[56:05] wrong with you and this and they
[56:06] prevented the people in fact in some of
[56:08] the movies that they put out they
[56:10] actually interviewed the people before
[56:12] they come in the prayer line and then
[56:14] they would come in the prayer line and
[56:15] then they would be healed and there was
[56:16] real healings that took place during
[56:18] that time and brother Branham said that
[56:21] was a gift of faith he said brother
[56:22] Roberts in his real way of Faith the
[56:24] little baby was healed he said now
[56:26] that's a real gift of faith that brother
[56:28] Roberts has and he said we know that
[56:30] brother Jack Coe how many of you have
[56:31] ever heard of Jack Coe
[56:33] boy there's a that's a trip if you go on
[56:36] YouTube and look up Jack Coe and watch
[56:38] his Services that's a real it's a real
[56:41] blessing really to watch but Jack Cole
[56:44] was different he had a different way he
[56:46] said he used to have a little anviling
[56:47] but the side of his desk and somebody
[56:49] come up with glasses on he'd take the
[56:51] glasses off and break them with the
[56:54] hammer and throw them over that's faith
[56:58] right and when Jack Coe would pray for
[57:00] somebody if you had a stomachache you
[57:02] didn't want to come into prayer line
[57:03] unless you wanted to be healed
[57:06] because he was going to make sure you
[57:07] were healed what he would do if you had
[57:09] a if you were hurting I'd seen a woman
[57:12] come up in front of him and she was
[57:13] hurting in her stomach and and Jack Co
[57:15] walked up to her and he said where does
[57:17] it hurt she said right here and he goes
[57:21] just as hard as he could in her stomach
[57:23] he said now he said every time I hit
[57:25] somebody they he said the Holy Ghost
[57:27] provides anesthetic so they don't feel
[57:28] the pain
[57:31] I hope so because he hit her pretty hard
[57:34] but he actually hit her in the stomach
[57:35] because he was so uh sure that she was
[57:38] healed
[57:40] right and that's the kind of faith that
[57:42] he had he said he'd have crutches he'd
[57:44] take their crutches first and and chop
[57:46] them up and throw them away he burned
[57:49] every bridge he did he destroyed the
[57:51] crutches destroy the wheelchair they
[57:53] didn't have any option but to be healed
[57:57] right and he said they only had one Jack
[58:00] Coe you know he said the world couldn't
[58:01] stand to at one time he said God Rest
[58:04] his precious Soul he certainly was a
[58:06] gallant man of Faith he had passed away
[58:07] by the time brother Branham talked about
[58:09] this he said one of the greatest ever
[58:11] seen in my life was Jack Coe he said
[58:12] well now he's gone to Glory today his
[58:14] work was finished and Satan could not
[58:16] have took him till his work was finished
[58:17] he said now there are men one different
[58:20] from the other altogether he said and in
[58:23] the ministry the Lord has given me he
[58:24] said most of these men were theologians
[58:26] great teachers and Scholars mine is not
[58:29] mine's more of a prophetic message he
[58:31] said in the way I teach Divine Healing
[58:33] is a work at the cross that has been
[58:35] completed for you
[58:37] I love this because this is something
[58:39] that lasts yeah
[58:41] yeah right whether brother Brandon was
[58:42] there or not this is still true
[58:45] oh my so this he's not relying on just a
[58:48] gift of faith but he's saying that he
[58:51] said Divine Healing is a work at the
[58:53] cross that has been completed for you
[58:56] and if you only just recognize it you
[58:59] can receive it how many believe that
[59:01] tonight if you'll recognize that you can
[59:03] receive it he said now brother Robertson
[59:05] these great Gallant men you say how do
[59:08] you place their Ministry to yours he
[59:10] said they're using scripture by laying
[59:12] on of hands he said now that's true that
[59:14] is a Bible Doctrine how many he knows
[59:16] that they shall lay hands on the sick
[59:17] they shall recover he said but if you'll
[59:19] just bear with me a moment he said I
[59:21] want to show you that wasn't a gentile
[59:22] Commission
[59:23] Jesus Jairus said come lay your hands on
[59:26] my daughter and she'll be healed he said
[59:28] the Jews always was laying on hands
[59:30] everything was laying on hands he said
[59:31] but watch the Gentile it wasn't so he
[59:34] said I'm not worthy that you come under
[59:35] my roof just speak the word and my
[59:37] servant will live and he turned around
[59:39] and said I've never seen Faith like that
[59:41] in Israel he said There It Is We're
[59:43] supposed to be on a higher level than
[59:46] that was he said we're living on the
[59:48] close closer of the world's closer of
[59:50] the World's End than we were then so
[59:52] what brother Adam's telling us as I
[59:55] understand it is that we have gifts of
[59:57] faith we have gifts of healing and those
[59:59] are all in the body do we believe that
[1:00:01] those are all in the body but we live in
[1:00:04] an age where we have a higher ceiling
[1:00:06] than that
[1:00:08] right we still have those things but we
[1:00:11] have a higher ceiling and what he means
[1:00:13] what I mean by that is that we have the
[1:00:15] ability to just speak
[1:00:18] and it'll happen
[1:00:20] right this is the age of the return of
[1:00:23] the spoken word this shows the power of
[1:00:25] the word and so he said we're supposed
[1:00:27] to be living on a higher level than even
[1:00:29] they were back there so there's a higher
[1:00:31] ceiling to this listen if you need
[1:00:33] somebody to lay hands on you come and
[1:00:35] have hands laid on you if you need a
[1:00:37] gift of faith you need to find somebody
[1:00:40] that that has Faith to pray for you
[1:00:42] that's a wonderful thing I believe that
[1:00:44] God's got men and women like that today
[1:00:46] that can pray for you
[1:00:48] I believe that there's people to pray
[1:00:49] for you but there's a there's a higher
[1:00:51] way he said the Gentile way is to
[1:00:53] believe the word he said that's exactly
[1:00:55] right to recognize he said look at that
[1:00:58] Gentile and he talked about the Roman
[1:00:59] Centurion what did the Centurion say he
[1:01:02] said I'm a man under Authority and he
[1:01:05] recognized that he said if you're like
[1:01:06] me he said I can tell somebody do
[1:01:08] something they do it I don't have to do
[1:01:10] it myself
[1:01:11] so he said I don't have to have you come
[1:01:12] to my house he said speak the word
[1:01:15] speak the word only it should be healed
[1:01:18] oh what a time we live in tonight what
[1:01:20] did you say well you don't understand
[1:01:21] brother Ben what's going on in my life
[1:01:23] right now you don't understand what's
[1:01:25] happening in my family but you live in a
[1:01:27] time you can say speak the word only
[1:01:30] amen even while the word is going forth
[1:01:32] you can be healed
[1:01:34] so there we we have all these options we
[1:01:37] ought to take advantage of it if there
[1:01:39] ever was the people ought to have
[1:01:40] healing among them it ought to be us
[1:01:43] are you with me now
[1:01:46] he said what did he recognize there that
[1:01:48] every sin and every disease and
[1:01:51] everything else was under his authority
[1:01:54] just say go and it will go he said see
[1:01:57] what he did he said no that's what I'm
[1:01:59] trying to get the American people to see
[1:02:01] he said you don't have to wait for a
[1:02:02] special time he said for a certain
[1:02:04] evangelist to come through and to pray
[1:02:06] for you he said your pastor is
[1:02:08] sufficient
[1:02:09] well that we had to take that quote out
[1:02:11] of context and just put it up your
[1:02:13] pastor is sufficient he said if the
[1:02:15] pastor isn't there your neighbor is
[1:02:16] sufficient
[1:02:19] yeah I'm assuming if your neighbor's a
[1:02:21] Christian I'm not sure if my neighbor's
[1:02:23] sufficient or not but
[1:02:25] Joel's one of my neighbors so
[1:02:28] but I know I know Joel's prayer is
[1:02:30] sufficient though right because he's a
[1:02:33] Believer he said they'll lay hands on
[1:02:35] the sick and they shall recover those
[1:02:38] that believe
[1:02:39] right now he said if the neighbor isn't
[1:02:42] there your husband or wife is sufficient
[1:02:45] if you're sitting next to your husband
[1:02:47] or wife turn around and tell them you're
[1:02:48] sufficient
[1:02:51] you're sufficient
[1:02:53] you're sufficient what for prayer for
[1:02:55] Faith he said you're sufficient he said
[1:02:58] if there's none of them there he said
[1:03:00] just raise up your hands
[1:03:02] he's sufficient always he said just
[1:03:06] wherever you are what a promise this is
[1:03:08] how this ought to raise our faith
[1:03:09] tonight he's sufficient always just
[1:03:12] wherever you are believe it it's a
[1:03:14] finish work
[1:03:16] and that's the difference in brother
[1:03:18] branham's Ministry and these other
[1:03:19] Ministries because they advertise here's
[1:03:21] a man with a gift of healing here's a
[1:03:23] great man of God here's the man of God
[1:03:25] for the hour brother random come out and
[1:03:27] taught about the atonement
[1:03:28] and he said I couldn't heal you if I
[1:03:30] wanted to
[1:03:32] but Christ has to heal you
[1:03:34] so there was a difference there
[1:03:37] what is faith well the Bible tells us
[1:03:40] what faith is in Hebrews 11 1 faith is
[1:03:42] the substance of things hoped for the
[1:03:46] evidence of Things Not Seen so it's it's
[1:03:50] the thing that makes me sure yes
[1:03:54] that what I can't see
[1:03:56] and what I expect will happen
[1:04:00] right it makes me sure that what I
[1:04:02] expect will happen this things hoped for
[1:04:04] and it gives me an Evidence or a down
[1:04:07] payment of things I can't see but I
[1:04:10] still believe it
[1:04:12] that's what faith is
[1:04:14] now brother Brown taught us he said most
[1:04:16] people today have hope instead of faith
[1:04:18] he said you find people coming on the
[1:04:20] platform they're just built up in hopes
[1:04:22] he said but faith is the substance of
[1:04:24] things hoped for the evidence it's not a
[1:04:26] myth it's not imagination it's something
[1:04:29] you've got you've already got it he said
[1:04:32] and you're just as happy with it that
[1:04:34] Faith you have as you would be if you
[1:04:36] had the substance in your hand he said
[1:04:39] for instance like this if I'm starving
[1:04:40] to death and a loaf of bread cost a
[1:04:42] quarter he said which will buy the love
[1:04:44] for bread that's a long time ago
[1:04:47] I noticed Bread's about three dollars
[1:04:49] now
[1:04:49] he said but now when I have the quarter
[1:04:51] in my hand I'm just as happy as if it
[1:04:54] was the loaf of bread because it's the
[1:04:56] purchase price of the bread
[1:04:58] oh do we really believe this tonight I'm
[1:05:00] just as happy if I have the if I have
[1:05:02] the quarter as if I had the loaf of
[1:05:04] bread he said when I know in my heart
[1:05:07] that I have accepted it and I believe
[1:05:10] that God has given it to me I'm just as
[1:05:13] happy with that Faith as if I was if I
[1:05:16] was healed because I'm going to be
[1:05:18] healed anyhow
[1:05:21] I've got the substance right now
[1:05:24] nobody can take it away from me I know
[1:05:27] it's right and I can be perseverant with
[1:05:30] that
[1:05:31] I I I don't know I think I've told you
[1:05:33] before but at some point in in my life
[1:05:36] you know after I had started having
[1:05:38] children it dropped down in my heart
[1:05:40] that my children would not be lost
[1:05:43] and I can't even comprehend my children
[1:05:46] being lost
[1:05:48] the devil's going to try everything he
[1:05:50] can are you with me now he's going to
[1:05:52] try everything he can but I can't even
[1:05:53] comprehend my children not being there
[1:05:56] why because it's a settled thing God
[1:05:59] said it I believe it that settles it or
[1:06:02] if we could be that way about our
[1:06:03] healing how much what a difference that
[1:06:05] would make it wouldn't matter what our
[1:06:07] symptoms were we'd say I know I'm Healed
[1:06:10] by the power of God I know I'm saved I
[1:06:12] know you know even our Salvation the
[1:06:14] devil will work on your mind trying to
[1:06:16] tell you you're not good enough you
[1:06:17] you've done so many bad things it's not
[1:06:20] based on your works you couldn't
[1:06:22] yourself a message believer you couldn't
[1:06:25] talk your way into it don't let the
[1:06:27] devil talk you out of it you couldn't
[1:06:28] talk your way into it you are where you
[1:06:30] are and you are who you are because of
[1:06:32] the Revelation that God gave you because
[1:06:34] of the faith that you have in your heart
[1:06:37] hey man you've got the substance
[1:06:41] nobody's going to talk to you out of
[1:06:42] that can't tell me my kids aren't going
[1:06:44] to be saved
[1:06:46] because the word says different
[1:06:49] Hallelujah
[1:06:51] amen
[1:06:53] he said for by it the elders obtained a
[1:06:56] good report by faith
[1:06:57] now what is faith based on and again I'm
[1:07:00] not trying to to teach you how to have a
[1:07:02] gift of faith but to tell you what faith
[1:07:04] is so that if you if someone prayed for
[1:07:07] you with a gift of faith you would know
[1:07:09] what that is somebody who believes
[1:07:11] that's all a gift of faith is that's all
[1:07:14] faith is it's just believing and being
[1:07:16] sure and it's not a mental Faith it's
[1:07:19] not a it's not a head knowledge but it's
[1:07:21] a it's a sureness from the heart
[1:07:24] that you know listen but it's based on
[1:07:28] something it's not just Faith it's not
[1:07:30] just uh faith based on uh happy thoughts
[1:07:34] it's not faith based on things are going
[1:07:37] good
[1:07:38] right but it's based on something
[1:07:41] he said through faith we understand that
[1:07:44] the worlds were framed by the word of
[1:07:47] God I wish somebody would preach with me
[1:07:49] tonight I've never said that before
[1:07:52] but but you know through faith we
[1:07:55] understand that the worlds were framed
[1:07:57] by the word of God so that things which
[1:07:59] are seen were not made of things which
[1:08:01] do appear right so Faith tells us that
[1:08:05] the worlds were framed by the word
[1:08:08] Faith rests on the word
[1:08:11] he said notice real Faith rests upon the
[1:08:14] solid rock of the promise of God's word
[1:08:17] it doesn't shift
[1:08:19] real faith is anchored aren't you glad
[1:08:22] for an anchor Today he said like in the
[1:08:25] North Star the North Star is a typos to
[1:08:27] every shipmaster the compass points him
[1:08:29] only to that North Star he said in God
[1:08:32] the word is every Christian's North Star
[1:08:34] if you're lost he said if the holy
[1:08:36] spirit is what points you to it it won't
[1:08:38] point to nothing else
[1:08:40] all other isms and so forth and
[1:08:42] Christianity mixed up in it whatever it
[1:08:44] may be it's like the world shifting it
[1:08:47] changes those stars but it can't change
[1:08:49] the North Star neither can anything
[1:08:51] change the word of God he said anchor to
[1:08:54] it stay with it
[1:08:56] well that's what I want to do
[1:08:58] it Hallelujah he said now real Faith
[1:09:01] doesn't shift the treats and man-made
[1:09:04] doctrines and unbelief it stays right
[1:09:07] with the word
[1:09:08] real faith in the word
[1:09:12] where can you put your faith on anything
[1:09:14] else but the word you better not put
[1:09:16] your faith in a person
[1:09:18] because the person will fail
[1:09:21] put your faith on a pastor the pastor
[1:09:22] will fail put your faith on a church the
[1:09:25] church will fail put your faith in your
[1:09:27] wife your wife might fail but your faith
[1:09:29] in your husband your husband might fail
[1:09:31] but if you put your faith in the word
[1:09:32] it'll always be right it'll always be
[1:09:35] true some of you that built your faith
[1:09:37] on the word many many years ago you can
[1:09:40] look back and save my life over the
[1:09:42] decades I am what I am today and my
[1:09:44] family are is what they are today
[1:09:46] because of the faith that I put in the
[1:09:48] word not because of the faith that I put
[1:09:50] in a man because you've been failed by
[1:09:52] many men I've been failed by many people
[1:09:54] I've been a failure I've failed myself
[1:09:58] right yes but many times we fail
[1:10:00] ourselves we mess up but he will never
[1:10:03] fail
[1:10:04] the word will never fail
[1:10:06] he said it don't shift
[1:10:08] he said it stays right with the word
[1:10:09] real faith in the word it don't shift on
[1:10:12] Creeds and man-made doctrines and where
[1:10:14] can you put your faith on anything else
[1:10:15] but the word if God said it hold your
[1:10:18] finger to it he said that's true it
[1:10:21] doesn't shift it draws from God's
[1:10:23] breasted book The Bible holy New
[1:10:26] Testament
[1:10:27] amen strength giving book or do you
[1:10:30] believe it's a strength giving book
[1:10:31] tonight I still believe that it is
[1:10:34] that's why I said we preach from the
[1:10:36] Bible we preach from the message of the
[1:10:37] hour it's a strength giving word
[1:10:40] amen he said it doesn't shift it's God's
[1:10:43] breasted book The Bible his attributes
[1:10:46] what he promised he said what he
[1:10:48] promised that's his word the word
[1:10:50] produces itself
[1:10:52] glory to God he said it has to be a
[1:10:55] thought before a word then a word then
[1:10:57] the word is manifested and that's where
[1:10:59] you draw your strength from he said
[1:11:01] believing believing for the Creator
[1:11:03] believing like he was the creator that
[1:11:06] made the world
[1:11:07] oh that's a foundation for Faith isn't
[1:11:09] it
[1:11:11] now I want to spend
[1:11:13] the rest of my time and and we'll have
[1:11:15] to come back to faith when I get back
[1:11:17] because this is just way too much but
[1:11:21] and it just it just struck me as a good
[1:11:23] opportunity to look at these things and
[1:11:27] but I want to look at Abel because
[1:11:28] that's the first example that uh that
[1:11:31] Paul gives
[1:11:33] is able in Hebrews 11 4 by faith Abel
[1:11:36] offered unto God a more excellent
[1:11:38] sacrifice than Cain by which you
[1:11:41] obtained witness that he was righteous
[1:11:42] God testifying of his gifts and by it he
[1:11:45] being dead yet speaketh
[1:11:48] now I got to thinking about Abel and the
[1:11:52] thought struck me he's just said that
[1:11:55] faith is in the word and then it comes
[1:11:57] to someone who didn't have the written
[1:12:00] word
[1:12:01] and he uses him as an example of faith
[1:12:05] now think about it for a moment he did
[1:12:07] not have the written word to base his
[1:12:09] faith on
[1:12:11] he didn't have anything here there was
[1:12:12] never he didn't even have a true story
[1:12:15] he hadn't been told what would happen
[1:12:18] correctly or what had happened correctly
[1:12:20] he had not been informed by his parents
[1:12:23] they had not taught him correctly about
[1:12:26] what had happened so he could not have
[1:12:28] formulated a doctrine of atonement based
[1:12:32] on what he knew
[1:12:34] right he could not figure it out he
[1:12:37] didn't have a Bible like we do to go
[1:12:38] back to to look at for an atonement yeah
[1:12:41] but there was something about it and let
[1:12:44] me say this that the atonement the
[1:12:46] blessings of God those things to us our
[1:12:48] own salvation the Bible says work out
[1:12:50] your own salvation with fear and
[1:12:52] trembling
[1:12:53] and ultimately it's gonna have to be a
[1:12:55] revelation from God to you
[1:12:58] right right you may shout you may speak
[1:13:00] in tongues you may run up and down the
[1:13:02] aisles you might you might do all kinds
[1:13:04] of things but ultimately you've got to
[1:13:06] know that you're saved right and you
[1:13:09] won't know it because somebody told you
[1:13:10] that you were right but you'll know it
[1:13:13] because you come God's provided way and
[1:13:15] something in you
[1:13:17] knows that you're saved
[1:13:20] listen it can't be convinced that you're
[1:13:23] not
[1:13:24] right you might get down you might get
[1:13:26] in despair you might have trouble but
[1:13:29] there's something inside of you I know
[1:13:30] I'm a Child of God
[1:13:32] and it's got to come to that because if
[1:13:34] we talk people into this message they'll
[1:13:36] talk themselves out of it if we talk
[1:13:38] people into being Believers you two will
[1:13:41] talk them out of it the websites will
[1:13:43] talk them out of it but if God ever
[1:13:45] speaks to them directly
[1:13:47] by Revelation that they know this is
[1:13:50] what I believe
[1:13:52] this is what I am this is who I am
[1:13:56] so now it can't be just a head knowledge
[1:13:59] can't be just because I taught you
[1:14:00] right or another Pastor taught you or
[1:14:03] somebody else taught you but it's got to
[1:14:05] be I know
[1:14:06] right I know that's what we have to come
[1:14:09] to I know
[1:14:10] I don't doubt it because somebody's mean
[1:14:13] to me
[1:14:14] I don't doubt it because I something
[1:14:17] bad's happening at work and I don't say
[1:14:19] there's anyone here doubting your
[1:14:20] salvation but the Devil comes to us all
[1:14:22] at times
[1:14:25] I'll be honest with you even a prophet
[1:14:27] of God was going he said one time to
[1:14:29] church and he was listening on the radio
[1:14:31] he said they were talking about how that
[1:14:33] the world there was it was Evolution
[1:14:35] that formed the world and all these
[1:14:37] things and how many millions of years
[1:14:38] old it was he said he was driving along
[1:14:40] listening he said in a thought come in
[1:14:41] his mind could that be true
[1:14:44] he said and I've seen God I've seen the
[1:14:46] dead race
[1:14:48] but it's just the devil
[1:14:50] and many times God that Satan puts those
[1:14:52] thoughts in her mind we need to rebuke
[1:14:54] it by the word of God because we do have
[1:14:57] a written word but it's got to be a
[1:14:59] revealed word to us
[1:15:02] it's got to be something that's revealed
[1:15:04] and so there's been times where the
[1:15:06] Harvey and I were talking earlier you
[1:15:08] know we think about somebody that's on
[1:15:10] drugs or on alcohol many times someone
[1:15:12] come and speak to him and tell them to
[1:15:14] commit suicide or do something like that
[1:15:15] and they'll do it and what a tragedy
[1:15:18] that that is for somebody to follow that
[1:15:20] but but I I'm not going to take a show
[1:15:23] of hands but I would say almost every
[1:15:25] person in this building at some point in
[1:15:27] your life has had a suicidal thought
[1:15:31] and it's just the devil
[1:15:34] you don't have to listen to that
[1:15:37] you don't have to give in to that
[1:15:39] just the devil now how much more if he
[1:15:42] could do that to you being a human being
[1:15:43] you know you shouldn't take your own
[1:15:45] life you know you have a good family and
[1:15:47] you people that love you and a church
[1:15:49] family that loves you and yet and yet
[1:15:51] the devil will try to tell you that how
[1:15:52] much more is he going to try to tell you
[1:15:53] you're not saved you're not Brian you're
[1:15:56] not going to make it listen he tell he
[1:15:58] tries out on me almost every day
[1:16:01] huh does he not do it he does it every
[1:16:03] day he points to your mistakes he points
[1:16:06] to what you've been he points to your
[1:16:07] past he points to things you've actually
[1:16:09] done and he said you're not good enough
[1:16:11] but we point to the blood of Christ on
[1:16:13] Calvary we point to the cross and say I
[1:16:16] believe in my atonement
[1:16:19] not because somebody talked me into it
[1:16:21] but I have a revelation
[1:16:24] faith
[1:16:26] [Music]
[1:16:27] now
[1:16:29] God honored Abel's faith and whenever
[1:16:32] you hear somebody say well I have a
[1:16:33] revelation I I don't need the written
[1:16:35] word because I've got a revelation well
[1:16:36] it's going to line up with the written
[1:16:38] word
[1:16:39] because Abel didn't have the written
[1:16:41] word and when the word was written it
[1:16:44] lined up what he did lined up with the
[1:16:46] written word
[1:16:48] right even though he didn't have it
[1:16:50] but now because his Revelation was true
[1:16:52] God honored his faith and when the word
[1:16:55] was written it proved that what he did
[1:16:57] by Revelation was exactly what needed to
[1:17:00] be done
[1:17:01] now in Genesis 4 3 it tells us that in
[1:17:03] process of time it come to pass that
[1:17:05] Cain brought to the fruit of the ground
[1:17:07] and offering unto the Lord
[1:17:09] now evidently they had been taught these
[1:17:11] boys have been taught that there was a
[1:17:13] god
[1:17:14] and they'd been taught to worship their
[1:17:16] creator
[1:17:17] and they wanted they had a desire to
[1:17:20] worship their creator that desire to
[1:17:24] worship was so strong that even the
[1:17:27] serpent seed seed line could not take
[1:17:29] that out
[1:17:30] right of the heart of Cain
[1:17:33] there was still something in him wanted
[1:17:34] to worship
[1:17:36] but he had the wrong father
[1:17:38] when I watched so he didn't have a
[1:17:40] revelation now they come brother random
[1:17:42] taught us that they come to the east
[1:17:43] side of Eden you've heard brother
[1:17:45] Branham talk about it I'm sure many
[1:17:46] times they come to the east side of Eden
[1:17:48] and they actually get there to the uh to
[1:17:51] the Garden at the East Gate he said
[1:17:53] where the cherubim was that had the
[1:17:55] Flaming sword
[1:17:56] remember there was a flaming sword that
[1:17:58] was placed when Adam and Eve were kicked
[1:18:00] out of the garden he put a cherubim with
[1:18:02] a flaming sword
[1:18:04] keep the way the way of the Tree of Life
[1:18:06] and brother Brown said that's where
[1:18:08] these boys came to offer because they
[1:18:10] knew they had to get back into that they
[1:18:12] had to come back into that place
[1:18:14] oh my and they're still true today so
[1:18:18] they come there to offer their sacrifice
[1:18:20] both of them wanted to make a sacrifice
[1:18:24] but their parents had left out some
[1:18:27] things out of the story of how they had
[1:18:29] fallen as we've already said
[1:18:30] now brother says Cain thought that
[1:18:33] making an antidote for sin that his
[1:18:35] father and his mother must have eat
[1:18:36] fruit as they were taught in that Garden
[1:18:39] now listen if it was fruit
[1:18:42] Cain's praise offering which is what he
[1:18:44] offered he offered a he offered an
[1:18:47] offering of worship
[1:18:48] but it wasn't an offering of an
[1:18:50] atonement
[1:18:51] right before you can offer an offering
[1:18:54] of Praise You got to offer an offering
[1:18:56] of there's got to be an offering of
[1:18:58] blood
[1:18:59] you've got to be saved
[1:19:01] right and you got to be born again and
[1:19:04] but now Cain's going to offer this by by
[1:19:07] his own mind he's thought about it and
[1:19:10] he was sincere and he thought that he
[1:19:12] could go and and offer this fruit and
[1:19:15] listen if it had been fruit that they
[1:19:17] ate that was the problem it would have
[1:19:19] worked
[1:19:22] right because that's what it was it
[1:19:24] caused the fall fruit
[1:19:26] but Abel knew better
[1:19:28] not because he was taught better but
[1:19:31] somehow he had a revelation
[1:19:33] now watch it says they were taught in
[1:19:36] the garden but Abel by divine revelation
[1:19:38] know that it was the blood that did it
[1:19:41] Genesis 4 4 and Abel he also brought her
[1:19:43] the first things of his flocking of the
[1:19:45] fat thereof and the Lord had respect
[1:19:47] unto Abel and to his offering I know
[1:19:49] you're thinking brother Ben you're way
[1:19:50] off of the gift of faith no that's
[1:19:52] exactly what we're talking about
[1:19:54] right yeah what's a gift
[1:19:57] something that's given to you
[1:19:59] you didn't earn it
[1:20:01] you didn't ask for it
[1:20:04] you didn't work for it because that's
[1:20:06] payment yes yes but a gift is something
[1:20:08] without us given to you
[1:20:10] and this Revelation that Abel had was
[1:20:13] not he didn't ask for it
[1:20:15] he didn't work his way into it he just
[1:20:17] had it
[1:20:19] we don't even realize how blessed We Are
[1:20:21] Tonight
[1:20:22] we don't even know how wonderful it is
[1:20:26] to know to be children of God who even
[1:20:28] want to be right
[1:20:29] to have that
[1:20:30] pressing in our soul that desire to be
[1:20:33] right that conviction that makes us want
[1:20:35] to live right and do right you don't
[1:20:37] even realize what a blessing it is he
[1:20:39] said but I messed up but you don't even
[1:20:40] realize what a blessing it is to want to
[1:20:43] be right
[1:20:45] and then to not only to want to be right
[1:20:48] but to actually have the ability to be
[1:20:51] right
[1:20:52] now look at this look how blessed we are
[1:20:54] that you can provide you can offer the
[1:20:57] right sacrifice you can die on The Altar
[1:20:59] with your lamb
[1:21:01] oh my God the privilege that you have to
[1:21:04] be able to do that
[1:21:05] it was given it's a gift
[1:21:08] gift of faith
[1:21:10] look
[1:21:13] Jehovah
[1:21:14] Abel Abel he revealed to Abel and Abel
[1:21:17] brought the first things of his flock
[1:21:19] into the fat thereof
[1:21:21] and the Bible says the Lord had respect
[1:21:24] that word means he looked with favor
[1:21:27] on Abel's offering
[1:21:30] brother Branham dramatizes he said Abel
[1:21:33] got a grapevine
[1:21:35] he said grabbed a hold of the the best
[1:21:37] sheep the first thing of his flock
[1:21:40] and he grabbed a hold of it and he
[1:21:41] pulled it bleeding to the altar because
[1:21:44] he didn't have rope you see he dragged
[1:21:47] it with a grapevine he drags it he
[1:21:49] throws it up on the altar he gets a
[1:21:51] sharp Rock
[1:21:52] and cuts its neck
[1:21:54] yeah unless the blood spill out over the
[1:21:56] over the altar and at the same time Cain
[1:21:59] has got his altar and if you had to
[1:22:01] judge between the two without spiritual
[1:22:03] Revelation you would never think that
[1:22:07] Cain was wrong and Abel was right yeah
[1:22:10] you would never believe no one could
[1:22:12] convince you if you didn't have a
[1:22:13] revelation of blood you would think why
[1:22:15] would God why would a holy wonderful God
[1:22:18] and made all this beauty want a lamb to
[1:22:21] be killed
[1:22:23] and
[1:22:24] you realize this was only the second
[1:22:26] time that anything had ever died
[1:22:29] as far as we know that we know of what
[1:22:32] was it the lamb that was killed for Adam
[1:22:34] and Eve when they walked out
[1:22:37] because he put a sheep he put lambskin
[1:22:39] sheepskins around them to cover them and
[1:22:42] then this lamb that was killed by Abel
[1:22:45] but they they must have thought why
[1:22:46] would something have to die
[1:22:48] but Abel just had a revelation
[1:22:51] he didn't understand it he didn't try to
[1:22:53] figure it out sometimes we overthink
[1:22:54] Church yeah
[1:22:58] yeah
[1:22:59] I'm just preaching to you tonight and we
[1:23:01] won't take very long but we overthink
[1:23:03] Church
[1:23:04] well if there's 400 people there then
[1:23:06] I'll be ready to have church or are
[1:23:09] certain people sing we can have church
[1:23:11] certain people pray we can have church
[1:23:13] and there's certain people there we can
[1:23:14] have church we overthink Church
[1:23:17] if you come to church tonight and you
[1:23:20] just come the way Abel did I don't
[1:23:22] understand why I'm doing what I'm doing
[1:23:24] but I just want to worship God tonight I
[1:23:26] don't even know I'm lifting my hands I
[1:23:28] don't even understand there's just
[1:23:30] something inside of me that cries out to
[1:23:32] God
[1:23:33] he didn't even have a church order but
[1:23:36] he knew what to do by faith
[1:23:38] by faith he offered a correct sacrifice
[1:23:40] that's what we need church not people
[1:23:42] picking at one another fighting and
[1:23:44] fussing with one another but faith
[1:23:46] become an offer before God
[1:23:48] the right kind of sacrifice
[1:23:51] amen
[1:23:53] well oh my I love this brother said what
[1:23:56] was it
[1:23:57] amen he said spiritually minded by
[1:24:01] election
[1:24:05] I hope you catch that
[1:24:08] Abel was spiritually minded by election
[1:24:11] knowing that the Earthly things doesn't
[1:24:14] please God he offered life and blood
[1:24:19] what did it speak of some four thousand
[1:24:22] years from then the Lamb of God with the
[1:24:24] Rope around his neck was led away to
[1:24:26] Calvary
[1:24:28] and Jehovah smiled at him
[1:24:31] he found favor the Bible doesn't say how
[1:24:34] but brother Branham tells us gives us a
[1:24:36] little insight into that both of those
[1:24:38] boys somehow knew that Abel's sacrifice
[1:24:40] was favored
[1:24:42] and brother Brandon puts it this way he
[1:24:43] said how did Cain when he made an altar
[1:24:45] just as pretty or prettier than Abel's
[1:24:48] he offered fruits to give his tithes he
[1:24:50] brought his income into the house of the
[1:24:52] Lord and trust me I'm not preaching
[1:24:54] against ties tonight
[1:24:57] that is not my purpose but he brought
[1:25:01] his ties into the house of the Lord he
[1:25:03] knelt on the altar he bowed himself he
[1:25:05] prayed he worshiped just as sincere as
[1:25:07] any man but God Vindicated Abel by
[1:25:11] consuming his sacrifice
[1:25:14] Hallelujah the same way that he
[1:25:16] Vindicated Elijah what was it the fire
[1:25:19] from heaven came down and consumed his
[1:25:21] sacrifice God Vindicated Abel by
[1:25:24] consuming his sacrifice God vindicates
[1:25:26] you today and he vindicates me for the
[1:25:29] same thing
[1:25:30] he vindicates that our faith is right by
[1:25:34] the fire of the Holy Ghost
[1:25:36] coming in and consuming all the
[1:25:38] atmospheres of our life consuming the
[1:25:41] desires of sin consuming those things
[1:25:43] listen if you haven't had that Firefall
[1:25:45] you need to go back and make sure that
[1:25:47] you have a real revelation of Faith
[1:25:49] because if you really have a revelation
[1:25:51] of faith that if you repent and are
[1:25:53] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ you
[1:25:55] will receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:25:56] and when you do it burns up every other
[1:25:58] desire
[1:26:01] are you hearing me tonight that's why
[1:26:03] brother Branham taught us that's why
[1:26:04] some people can't live the Christian
[1:26:05] Life they've just never come to that
[1:26:08] place
[1:26:09] because you come to that place yeah sure
[1:26:10] you'll see you're still flesh because of
[1:26:12] a sticky nature you'll still fall but
[1:26:14] there's something inside of you that
[1:26:15] won't let go
[1:26:16] something inside of you that'll come in
[1:26:18] and take over if you just yield to it
[1:26:22] see God vindicates the New Birth by the
[1:26:24] fire of the Holy Ghost
[1:26:26] it says about verse 5 but unto Cain and
[1:26:28] to his offering he had not respect and
[1:26:30] Cain was very Roth in his countenance
[1:26:32] fell
[1:26:33] and the Lord said unto Cain why aren't
[1:26:35] thou we're off and why is thy
[1:26:37] countenance Fallen if thou doest well
[1:26:40] shalt thou not be accepted if thou doest
[1:26:43] not well sin lies at the door and unto
[1:26:45] thee shall be his desire and thou shalt
[1:26:48] rule over him
[1:26:49] again remember Abel had no written word
[1:26:52] to be able to do it right Cain was told
[1:26:55] how to do it
[1:26:57] and still couldn't do it
[1:26:59] he had an example of what to do
[1:27:02] and if he'd have done it he could have
[1:27:04] been saved
[1:27:06] right God's telling him but God knew he
[1:27:08] wouldn't because he was the wrong seed
[1:27:11] you understand so God knew that he
[1:27:14] wouldn't do it but he could have because
[1:27:16] God said if you do well
[1:27:19] you'll be accepted
[1:27:21] he still would not he refused to do it
[1:27:24] even though he knew Abel had no written
[1:27:26] word had no God never spoke to him and
[1:27:28] told him as far as we know he never told
[1:27:30] him anything about it but by Revelation
[1:27:32] he just did what God required
[1:27:35] Listen by revelation of the word I'll be
[1:27:37] just a few more minutes he said by
[1:27:39] revelation of the word God's word before
[1:27:41] it was even written Abel by faith
[1:27:43] offered unto God a more excellent
[1:27:45] sacrifice than that of Cain which
[1:27:46] testified he was righteous the word
[1:27:49] reflecting itself through him by his
[1:27:51] offering isn't that what you want
[1:27:52] tonight that's what I want the word to
[1:27:54] reflect itself through me
[1:27:57] so we find then that this gift of faith
[1:27:59] lined up with the word
[1:28:01] Abel by Revelation what was he doing he
[1:28:06] this this faith that he had caused him
[1:28:08] to look forward to a Time
[1:28:11] when that cherubim wouldn't be standing
[1:28:13] there no more
[1:28:14] because it's sword the fiery sword had
[1:28:17] been quenched
[1:28:18] you realize that's we're living in that
[1:28:20] time Abel had to look forward to that
[1:28:23] time but we're living in that time
[1:28:25] because he promised in Revelation 2 7 he
[1:28:28] promised that he would give to eat the
[1:28:30] him that overcometh well I give to eat
[1:28:31] of the tree of life we read that he
[1:28:33] reached slain but what does that mean it
[1:28:35] means the way has been opened back up
[1:28:38] it means that the cherubim's Flaming
[1:28:40] sword has been extinguished it's been
[1:28:42] cheap
[1:28:43] brother bouncer what a thrilling thought
[1:28:45] this is that tree of life in the Garden
[1:28:47] of Eden which could not be approached
[1:28:48] sent to because of the fall of Adam is
[1:28:51] now given to the Overcomer the Flaming
[1:28:53] sword of the guarding cherubim has been
[1:28:55] sheathed but it was not sheath there its
[1:28:58] blood was Bloody with the blood of the
[1:28:59] Lamb
[1:29:00] he took his flaming sword and he
[1:29:03] quenched the fire of it with his own
[1:29:05] blood
[1:29:07] oh my
[1:29:09] God Hebrews tells us that it's not
[1:29:11] possible the blood of Bolson of ghosts
[1:29:12] should take away sins
[1:29:15] now watch
[1:29:17] both boys Cain and Abel had faith in us
[1:29:19] to come and worship both had Faith to
[1:29:22] make a sacrifice but only Abel had faith
[1:29:24] in the atoning blood of the Lamb it
[1:29:26] matters what you have faith in
[1:29:30] but we are not come to the old Covenant
[1:29:33] aren't you glad of that
[1:29:34] aren't you glad we're not living under
[1:29:36] the law quit beating yourself up for not
[1:29:39] living the law nobody ever has
[1:29:41] if you could do it you'd be the first
[1:29:43] one
[1:29:45] right you'd be the very first one if you
[1:29:49] could do it we talked about dress Sunday
[1:29:52] afternoon and these things it's not
[1:29:53] that's not a a litmus test well if
[1:29:56] you're saved you know to be saved you're
[1:29:59] going to have to come jump through all
[1:30:00] these hoops that's not what it is at all
[1:30:01] we want to please God we we want to do
[1:30:04] we want to live the word of God it's a
[1:30:06] revelation to us we want to do it nobody
[1:30:09] sit there with a club and made Abel go
[1:30:11] to church that day nobody sat there and
[1:30:13] made him do it no what did he do he went
[1:30:15] and pulled the Lamb by his own volition
[1:30:18] his own free will he come up there but
[1:30:20] it really wasn't it was really the
[1:30:21] revelation of God the election of God
[1:30:24] that made him come
[1:30:25] you come to church tonight by your own
[1:30:27] free will or so you thought but really
[1:30:29] it was a revelation of God that dragged
[1:30:31] you to the house of God Amen so you can
[1:30:33] die on your altar
[1:30:35] Hallelujah and Christ could live
[1:30:39] hey man we've come to a different
[1:30:41] Mountain we've read all this before in
[1:30:43] Hebrews 12 24 he said we've come to
[1:30:45] Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant
[1:30:47] to the blood of sprinkling to speaketh
[1:30:49] better things than that of Abel he said
[1:30:53] by faith Abel's blood spoke but now by
[1:30:56] faith this Blood speaks better things
[1:30:59] he said so then if the worshiper under
[1:31:01] the law could not be purged because if
[1:31:03] the lamb was only a shadow and he went
[1:31:06] away with the same desire yet it was
[1:31:08] speaking correctly to the right lamb
[1:31:10] coming he said then when God sent his
[1:31:12] lamb
[1:31:14] and he died and the worshiper then
[1:31:16] coming putting his hands by faith how
[1:31:19] can we do that today upon the bleeding
[1:31:21] locks of the Lord Jesus and can in your
[1:31:24] heart
[1:31:25] now listen to me closely as we get ready
[1:31:27] to close in your heart appreciate that
[1:31:31] he was the only thing that could ever
[1:31:33] come and redeem you
[1:31:35] oh my good we do this tonight husband
[1:31:37] you don't know what I've been through
[1:31:38] today put your hands on the bloody locks
[1:31:41] of Jesus
[1:31:42] put your hands on Jesus on him who has
[1:31:46] died for you and recognize amen and
[1:31:49] realize that he's the only one who could
[1:31:51] ever do it
[1:31:52] oh my if you can appreciate in your
[1:31:54] heart he was the only one who could
[1:31:56] redeem you you'd be lost and gone to
[1:31:57] hell and then to appreciate his love for
[1:32:01] you
[1:32:01] when you were unlovable
[1:32:04] Hallelujah appreciate his foreknowledge
[1:32:07] of you
[1:32:09] that you'd have a heart to do it right
[1:32:12] glory to God appreciate his leading of
[1:32:15] the Holy Spirit to bring you to that
[1:32:17] place to accept it
[1:32:19] and you lay your hands upon Him by faith
[1:32:21] and renounce your own life as a sinner
[1:32:23] and accept his life instead the blood of
[1:32:26] Jesus Christ then cleanses you
[1:32:29] I thought of his brother David you know
[1:32:31] some some of us have had we've had
[1:32:33] trouble in the past and our families and
[1:32:35] and family trees that weren't the
[1:32:36] greatest and I thought about that I and
[1:32:38] I thought bless the Lord I'm just like
[1:32:40] Abel was Abel had trouble in his family
[1:32:43] tree there was adultery in his parents
[1:32:45] home there was all kinds of trouble but
[1:32:47] he was not bound by that he had a
[1:32:49] revelation he didn't quit the message
[1:32:51] and go run off somewhere else but what
[1:32:52] did he do he stayed right with it why
[1:32:54] because he was he had a revelation of
[1:32:57] the word of God it was election in his
[1:32:59] heart here I want to tell you tonight I
[1:33:02] got to close but I want to tell you I'm
[1:33:04] only here by the election of God I'm
[1:33:07] only here because God called me I'm not
[1:33:09] here because I wanted to be I'm not here
[1:33:11] because I willed myself to be I'm not
[1:33:14] here because I stuck it out or I was
[1:33:16] stubborn enough to do it but I'm here
[1:33:18] because of the grace of almighty God
[1:33:19] that called me to be here and the
[1:33:22] message is true in spite of what people
[1:33:24] make it to be
[1:33:27] brother Brown puts it this way he said
[1:33:29] I'd be a very discouraged man if it
[1:33:31] wasn't for election
[1:33:33] get your eyes off people yeah
[1:33:35] people are going to be people
[1:33:37] Proverbs says where there's oxen there
[1:33:39] has to be stalls cleaned paraphrasing
[1:33:43] people are people but God is still God
[1:33:48] and you've got a revelation tonight you
[1:33:50] you appreciate what he did for you you
[1:33:53] appreciate you lay your hands on him by
[1:33:56] faith renounce your own life as a sinner
[1:33:58] and accept his life instead the blood of
[1:34:00] Jesus Christ then cleanses you yes and
[1:34:04] the life that was in the blood cell of
[1:34:05] Christ which was none other than God
[1:34:07] himself the Holy Spirit comes back into
[1:34:09] your life and coincides with your body
[1:34:11] and you act and walk a Christian Life
[1:34:14] till the day you leave the world and the
[1:34:17] devil couldn't touch you if he had to
[1:34:21] power to God that's the result of Faith
[1:34:24] that's what faith will do that's a gift
[1:34:26] of faith
[1:34:27] Hallelujah the devil couldn't touch you
[1:34:30] if you had to amen every promise in the
[1:34:32] book
[1:34:33] is yours
[1:34:36] where do we get that Faith it's a gift
[1:34:37] from God
[1:34:40] oh my we we don't look at that and say
[1:34:43] well I you know I I'm all confused no
[1:34:46] you just accept it yes it's a gift these
[1:34:49] gifts come Among Us and I'm not doing
[1:34:51] this to promote gifts by the way that's
[1:34:54] not why I'm preaching this I want us to
[1:34:56] understand what it is what a prophet
[1:34:57] taught about it so that if it did come
[1:35:00] it would be right it'd be in order and
[1:35:02] things would be right but listen listen
[1:35:04] I believe these gifts are in the body
[1:35:06] but if it comes we should just accept
[1:35:08] what God gives
[1:35:10] right if it's right then God gave it we
[1:35:12] should just accept it
[1:35:14] right make sure it's right but if it is
[1:35:16] we should just accept it we should just
[1:35:18] believe it we should say Lord I believe
[1:35:20] you spoke
[1:35:21] right for me
[1:35:23] amen
[1:35:24] the Bible tells us musicians go ahead
[1:35:26] and come the Bible tells us by grace are
[1:35:29] you saved through faith and that not of
[1:35:31] yourselves it is the gift of God
[1:35:35] Hallelujah not of work since any man
[1:35:38] should boast for we are his workmanship
[1:35:40] created in Christ Jesus under good works
[1:35:43] which God hath before ordained that we
[1:35:46] should walk
[1:35:47] in them would you bow your heads with me
[1:35:53] I wonder if you've got a need
[1:35:55] tonight you'd like to make known by way
