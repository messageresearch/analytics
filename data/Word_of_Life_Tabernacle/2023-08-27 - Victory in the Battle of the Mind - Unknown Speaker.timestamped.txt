[52:23] been faithful in that position for many

[55:17] walketh about seeking whom he may devour
[55:21] whom resists steadfast in the faith
[55:25] knowing that the same afflictions are
[55:27] accomplished in your brethren that are
[55:30] in the world
[55:31] but the God of all Grace who has called
[55:34] you who has called us into his eternal
[55:36] glory by Christ Jesus

[55:47] be a fight there's going to be a time of

[55:50] suffering but then there's going to be a
[55:52] victory as well and I want to speak to
[55:54] you this morning on Victory in the
[55:56] battle of the Mind victory in the battle
[55:58] of the Mindless bow our heads together
[56:00] Heavenly Father we're so grateful to be
[56:02] in your presence this morning so
[56:04] thankful Lord to know that you're with
[56:06] us that you're the same yesterday today
[56:08] and forever Lord as I saw that yesterday
[56:10] on the wall of a hospital that we were
[56:12] visiting Lord I just struck my heart I
[56:15] thought oh if the world could even
[56:17] testify that you are the same yesterday
[56:19] today and forever what does that mean to
[56:21] us as Believers it means that anything
[56:23] is possible and that we are your your
[56:25] children Lord and we can have what we
[56:28] ask for we're so thankful for that today
[56:30] you've got it all in control Lord I pray
[56:33] that you'd bless this service take take
[56:35] me out of the way Lord and speak
[56:37] directly to your people God we want to
[56:39] help help people we we're not just here
[56:41] to just to speak or to be seen But Lord
[56:44] we want you to speak Lord we we realize
[56:47] we can only help so much through through
[56:49] carnal methods Lord we we want your Holy
[56:51] Spirit to come in and take over this
[56:53] service Lord and speak and Lord be the
[56:56] speaker be the hearer Lord and we pray
[56:58] that you would do it pray you would heal
[57:00] every sick person Lord those that aren't
[57:02] able to be here this morning I pray
[57:03] you'd raise them up Lord we ask in Jesus
[57:06] name amen God bless you you can be
[57:09] seated this morning good to see brother
[57:11] JT back with us this morning God bless
[57:14] you good to have you with us today
[57:18] amen every one of us fight a battle in
[57:22] the mind
[57:23] it's not the battle of the Mind as much
[57:26] as it is the battle in the mind the
[57:28] battle is between Good and Evil and and
[57:31] it's the same battle that has been
[57:34] fought since the beginning of time since
[57:36] Satan fell it's there's been a battle
[57:39] and the Angelic battles brother Branham
[57:43] taught us became human battles and now
[57:45] there's a battle in the mind now we're
[57:48] involved in this battle it's a battle
[57:49] between good and evil and is fought for
[57:52] control of a place called the mind so
[57:55] that's the No Man's Land brother Branham
[57:57] told us that was selected for this
[58:00] battle to take place in so the battle is
[58:03] could I say it this way the battle is
[58:05] for you
[58:06] right it's a battle of Good and Evil and
[58:09] it's a battle for your soul yeah
[58:11] yeah it's a battle for you and so
[58:14] brother random said when this great
[58:15] battle started on Earth there had to be
[58:17] a mutual meeting place there had to be a
[58:20] place selected for the battle to begin
[58:22] and for the battle to rage and that
[58:24] Battleground began in the human mind so
[58:27] this is where where everything begins
[58:30] and so it's a no man's land it's a place
[58:33] where the battle is fought but I want us
[58:35] to think about it today this morning and
[58:37] this afternoon if the Lord is willing I
[58:40] want us to think about it as a place
[58:41] where the king dwells and so you're
[58:44] you're a three-part being your body Soul
[58:47] and Spirit and if you look at an old
[58:50] city a walled City they would always
[58:52] have an outer defense an inner defense
[58:55] and then on the inside there's a keep so
[58:58] it's like three rings of a circle
[59:00] there's an outer wall an inner wall and
[59:03] on the inside is the stronghold to keep
[59:05] and so we have a body we have a soul we
[59:08] have a spirit it's a walled City you
[59:10] can't just get in any way okay but the
[59:12] way that we access our body is by the
[59:15] five senses of the body so the five
[59:18] senses of the body are sight taste
[59:21] feeling smell and hearing yeah right
[59:24] we've all been taught that right so then
[59:27] but there are also five senses of the
[59:29] spirit so think of those senses as Gates
[59:32] right just to simplify for it so for us
[59:35] for me so that I could be able to
[59:37] understand it I thought of those senses
[59:39] as Gates brother Brown describes it as
[59:41] that in some places so there's Gates
[59:43] there's there's a gate of sight of taste
[59:45] the feeling of smell of hearing and then
[59:48] inside of that in that inner wall and in
[59:50] your spirit realm there's Gates there as
[59:53] well imagination
[59:55] conscience memory reason and affection
[59:59] so five gates of the body five gates of
[1:00:02] the spirit realm and then one gate to
[1:00:04] the soul
[1:00:06] and that gate brother Branham in
[1:00:07] different places he calls it Faith or
[1:00:09] doubt he calls it free will
[1:00:11] right so you you have the ability only
[1:00:14] you have the ability to let something in
[1:00:16] or out
[1:00:17] in the soul so now when you're born into
[1:00:21] the world so that there's a throne room
[1:00:23] that's the soul it's a throne room
[1:00:25] that's where the king is to dwell when
[1:00:27] you're born into the world as you reach
[1:00:29] the age of accountability battle begins
[1:00:32] and so there's fighting going on
[1:00:34] everywhere that all through these outer
[1:00:36] defenses they're they're just broken
[1:00:38] down they're uh we're not you know if
[1:00:40] you're not taught the word especially if
[1:00:41] you come up in a non-Christian home or
[1:00:43] you come up in a denominational realm
[1:00:45] there's just all kinds of battles going
[1:00:47] on everywhere and maybe you give in to
[1:00:49] different things you become addicted to
[1:00:51] certain things and and that all all that
[1:00:54] you're losing the battle all the time
[1:00:55] but there's got to come a place in your
[1:00:57] life where you're not losing the battle
[1:00:59] every time say brother man I'm fighting
[1:01:01] the battle of the mind I'm fighting the
[1:01:02] battle in the mind I'm fighting the
[1:01:04] Battle of Good and Evil but there's got
[1:01:05] to come a time when you begin to win
[1:01:07] some battles yeah still be in the war
[1:01:09] Satan's still going to come back and
[1:01:11] attack you but there's got to come a
[1:01:13] time you begin to win in that right
[1:01:16] and that's what we want to do don't you
[1:01:17] want to be a winner and not a loser well
[1:01:19] you are a winner and not a loser
[1:01:21] according to the word
[1:01:22] so we can have victory in the battle of
[1:01:25] the Mind
[1:01:26] so as you reach this age of
[1:01:28] accountability at some point God's word
[1:01:30] is introduced
[1:01:32] to you
[1:01:34] and somehow through these senses of the
[1:01:36] body and the spirit you know we know the
[1:01:38] word specifically is is introduced to us
[1:01:40] to the sense of hearing so we tell our
[1:01:43] children you need to be baptized you
[1:01:45] need to be filled with the Holy Spirit
[1:01:47] they hear that word
[1:01:49] right we we quote Acts 2 38 to him right
[1:01:53] repent and be baptized in the name of
[1:01:55] Jesus Christ you shall receive the gift
[1:01:56] of the Holy Ghost we quote that to him
[1:01:57] and and they have to believe that and
[1:02:00] but but but that's in their mind it
[1:02:02] comes through their sense of hearing and
[1:02:04] maybe they'll be in the service
[1:02:05] atmosphere is important yeah because
[1:02:07] that all your senses are inlets and
[1:02:10] maybe they're in a service and they feel
[1:02:12] the presence of God they have a feeling
[1:02:14] they have a sense of the presence of God
[1:02:15] it's coming in through these Gates
[1:02:17] because and that's the kind of
[1:02:19] atmospheres we want our children to be
[1:02:20] around we want them to we want them
[1:02:22] because those Gates don't just let in
[1:02:24] bad things they let in good things
[1:02:26] so here our children are soaking this in
[1:02:29] and so maybe one day they feel the
[1:02:31] presence of God in a certain way and
[1:02:33] they repent of their sins and they ask
[1:02:34] Jesus to come in their heart and then
[1:02:36] they want to be baptized they want to
[1:02:38] start taking communion and and all of
[1:02:39] those things and begin to see that
[1:02:41] what's happening the battle's not over
[1:02:43] but there's been a victory in that
[1:02:44] battle there's been a victory that and
[1:02:47] now the the city The Walls Start to be
[1:02:49] built up and and it don't happen
[1:02:51] overnight it takes years but David over
[1:02:53] and over and over again we build and we
[1:02:55] work and we build and we work and God
[1:02:57] works on us yeah
[1:02:59] and it's hard sometimes it's tough
[1:03:00] sometimes but he's building he's doing
[1:03:02] something
[1:03:04] so now
[1:03:05] as we go through this battle that's the
[1:03:08] God's word is introduced into the battle
[1:03:10] and now there's a battle between faith
[1:03:12] and doubt
[1:03:13] the Bible says this is the love of God
[1:03:15] that we keep his Commandments and his
[1:03:18] Commandments are not Grievous for
[1:03:21] whatsoever is born of God overcometh the
[1:03:24] world
[1:03:25] and this is the victory
[1:03:28] so if you want to think about Victory
[1:03:29] what is victory in the battle of the
[1:03:31] Mind faith is the victory in the battle
[1:03:34] of the mind this is the victory that
[1:03:36] overcometh the world even our faith
[1:03:40] so the victory is faith faith doesn't
[1:03:42] bring the victory faith is the victory
[1:03:47] Amen in other words when faith is
[1:03:49] present you've won the Battle of the
[1:03:51] mind or the battle in the mind and yet
[1:03:54] there'll be another battle there will be
[1:03:55] many other it'll come over and over
[1:03:57] again but as long as faith is there in
[1:04:00] any given situation Faith overcomes the
[1:04:03] enemy
[1:04:03] how many believe that today it's faith
[1:04:06] that does that nothing else can do that
[1:04:07] the five senses of the of the body the
[1:04:09] five senses of the spirit but if you can
[1:04:11] ever get Faith on the inside in that
[1:04:13] keep on the inside when when the Holy
[1:04:15] Ghost when the king begins to Reign once
[1:04:18] there was no one it was just desolate
[1:04:20] and and there was no one there but now
[1:04:22] the the palace has been restored you
[1:04:25] were made to serve God there's a king
[1:04:27] sitting there and He Reigns and and
[1:04:29] there's faith that comes out
[1:04:32] right not Faith from the outside but
[1:04:34] Faith from the inside
[1:04:36] and that Faith again is increased by
[1:04:38] hearing the word
[1:04:40] so now Faith is the victory
[1:04:43] brother Brown said faith is the victory
[1:04:45] over death yes
[1:04:47] amen faith is the victory over sin Faith
[1:04:51] well what do I need to do brother men do
[1:04:52] I need to do Penance do I need to drag
[1:04:54] myself over logs no faith is the victory
[1:04:57] yes sir
[1:04:59] maybe I should punish myself in some way
[1:05:01] no what you need to do is have faith you
[1:05:04] need to believe
[1:05:05] faith is the victory over them faith is
[1:05:09] the victory over sickness faith is the
[1:05:11] victory over are you with me this
[1:05:12] morning faith is the victory over worry
[1:05:15] faith is the victory over frustrations
[1:05:18] faith is the victory over the world yes
[1:05:21] sir
[1:05:23] now he said faith is a conqueror
[1:05:27] Faith was not a passive thing faith is
[1:05:29] an overcomer
[1:05:30] it just isn't a peacemaker it overcomes
[1:05:35] right so we don't make peace with the
[1:05:37] Enemy at the gates but we're watching to
[1:05:40] identify who that enemy is because every
[1:05:43] thought is a potential enemy
[1:05:46] right it's a potential enemy it's a
[1:05:48] potential friend and we have to decide
[1:05:50] by the word of God whether that thought
[1:05:52] is going to stay or whether whether it's
[1:05:54] going to be allowed across the border or
[1:05:55] whether you're going to kick it out
[1:05:58] right so faith is it just isn't a
[1:06:00] peacemaker it overcomes faith is the
[1:06:03] victory that overcomes the world what
[1:06:06] does it do what is Faith what is to
[1:06:08] conquer conquer in Victory is the same
[1:06:10] he said to conquer it means to beat down
[1:06:12] to override to handcuff to throw into
[1:06:15] prison
[1:06:17] right so we can say it this way when
[1:06:19] you're not saved when you when you're
[1:06:21] not filled with the Holy Spirit you're
[1:06:22] not born again
[1:06:24] there's nothing there's no
[1:06:25] Administration there's no government in
[1:06:27] your soul
[1:06:29] right so you you know anything can take
[1:06:31] place there's no law
[1:06:33] you you can oh I want to get rid of my
[1:06:35] smoking my drinking all these other
[1:06:37] things but you can't do it you're
[1:06:38] helpless
[1:06:39] because the law is law of sin it's the
[1:06:42] law it's the law of death
[1:06:44] right but there has to be the law of
[1:06:46] Liberty that comes in the law of Grace
[1:06:48] and God has to there has to be a an
[1:06:51] Administration set up that can then
[1:06:53] begin to run your life
[1:06:56] right it'd be a government
[1:06:58] that begins to run our life and it's not
[1:07:01] the government of man it's not even the
[1:07:03] government of the church although there
[1:07:04] is governments in the church but that's
[1:07:06] not what this is this is the government
[1:07:08] of Christ
[1:07:09] he is the king amen and his government
[1:07:12] the currency of that government if we
[1:07:14] can say it that way is faith
[1:07:16] that's what he Rules by now Faith is the
[1:07:20] victory he said he said it means the sin
[1:07:24] that once ruled you you rule it now
[1:07:27] it means that you have overcome it
[1:07:30] you've whipped it you are greater than
[1:07:33] it is
[1:07:35] Hallelujah
[1:07:36] you don't always have to give in
[1:07:39] right right they don't always have to
[1:07:41] continue to be like it always was yeah
[1:07:43] but faith is the victory
[1:07:46] so he said faith is the victory that
[1:07:48] overcomes Every curse of the devil
[1:07:50] someone say Every curse
[1:07:53] oh but but brother Ben you don't
[1:07:54] understand my family my situation Every
[1:07:56] curse of the devil faith is the victory
[1:08:00] that overcomes that
[1:08:02] so he said uh he said faith in what not
[1:08:07] faith in your church
[1:08:08] not faith in your Creed not faith in
[1:08:11] some man but faith in Jesus Christ who
[1:08:15] made the promise that's the victory what
[1:08:17] is it it is the victory say my arm is
[1:08:20] still crippled but faith is the victory
[1:08:23] I still feel sick but faith is the
[1:08:26] victory
[1:08:28] oh it overcomes the world he said when
[1:08:31] you can climb into God by prayer until
[1:08:33] you seem to think conquered under you
[1:08:36] there's nothing can hurt
[1:08:37] you've overcome you've got 50 miles of
[1:08:41] Elbow Room you're sailing free then
[1:08:44] faith is the victory
[1:08:48] he said you have been a drunkard and a
[1:08:49] slave to Whiskey you will be the master
[1:08:51] over him then hallelujah some of you can
[1:08:54] testify with that he said that Old Devil
[1:08:56] of alcohol that made you a drink he's
[1:08:58] your master now but when you get Faith
[1:09:00] he said I don't mean Make Believe real
[1:09:01] Faith he's your servant then
[1:09:04] you who can't lay down tobacco you women
[1:09:06] and men when it comes to a place where
[1:09:08] you can get to that spot where you have
[1:09:10] overcome it by faith you'll Master it
[1:09:12] then
[1:09:13] Hallelujah he said real Faith knows no
[1:09:16] defeat it cannot be defeated just
[1:09:19] cutting out it cannot be defeated even
[1:09:21] death itself can't defeat it aren't you
[1:09:24] glad for that today even death itself
[1:09:26] can't defeat real faith
[1:09:30] amen faith is the victory faith has its
[1:09:34] own language
[1:09:35] do you know that
[1:09:37] everything else those defeat but Faith
[1:09:39] doesn't know the faith has its own
[1:09:40] language we need to learn the language
[1:09:42] of faith
[1:09:45] it has its own language but the brand
[1:09:48] talks about that he said if you go to a
[1:09:50] foreign country he said you wouldn't use
[1:09:51] a bunch of American slang
[1:09:54] right you wouldn't go over there use a
[1:09:56] bunch of Americans saying he said what
[1:09:57] would you use you'd use the language of
[1:09:59] the country that you were in you'd try
[1:10:01] to learn how can I have a cup of coffee
[1:10:03] what is it you know just the little
[1:10:04] things that it would take we need to be
[1:10:06] learning the language of Faith quit
[1:10:08] speaking the language of defeat and the
[1:10:10] language of sorrow and the language of
[1:10:12] worry and start speaking the language of
[1:10:14] faith
[1:10:16] we have to learn that language
[1:10:19] he said I think it would behoove
[1:10:20] Christians more today if they were
[1:10:22] trying to learn some Heavenly language
[1:10:24] the Praises of God that we're going to
[1:10:26] sing over there and enjoy he said and
[1:10:29] the people that does not believe in
[1:10:30] shouting what would you do when you get
[1:10:32] over there
[1:10:33] he said you would be so out of place
[1:10:37] he said better get Faith and overcome
[1:10:40] now for faith is the victory that
[1:10:43] overcomes he said no he said you
[1:10:44] wouldn't be tagging little things like
[1:10:46] that
[1:10:47] you get Faith you that all that legalism
[1:10:49] starts to go
[1:10:51] yeah because you begin to realize God's
[1:10:53] going to take care of his church God's
[1:10:55] in charge amen
[1:10:57] so you wouldn't be tagging little things
[1:10:59] like that you would be having Victory
[1:11:00] it's time we had some we've been hearing
[1:11:02] about the battle in the mind all of our
[1:11:04] life it's time we had some victory in it
[1:11:07] [Music]
[1:11:09] now
[1:11:11] you might tell me this morning brother
[1:11:12] Ben that faith is the Victory and faith
[1:11:14] comes by hearing why don't I have more
[1:11:16] faith
[1:11:17] why don't I have more victory
[1:11:19] faith has to come to a place that's not
[1:11:22] just mental faith
[1:11:24] but it has been accepted by the soul
[1:11:28] and quickened to life
[1:11:30] and we call this the baptism of the Holy
[1:11:32] Ghost the true baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:11:34] the token to differentiate from just a
[1:11:36] feeling or just an experience although
[1:11:39] it is an experience but it's if there's
[1:11:40] a there's a reality to it of a changed
[1:11:42] life see the king is there now
[1:11:47] he wasn't there and now he is right it's
[1:11:50] just like an old house if you've got an
[1:11:52] old house that's all dilapidated and and
[1:11:54] down you can tell when you drive by
[1:11:56] brother Danny nobody lives there anymore
[1:11:58] used to be a nice place but brother so
[1:12:00] and so they used to live there and her
[1:12:02] sister so-and-so used to live there now
[1:12:03] now it's just overgrown with weeds and
[1:12:06] then one day you walk you begin to see
[1:12:07] the weeds are beginning to be cut and
[1:12:09] the fences are beginning to be built
[1:12:10] back and the house is being painted what
[1:12:13] happened to that house somebody moved in
[1:12:16] right somebody told mine somebody took
[1:12:19] ownership there's a new government in
[1:12:21] that house don't you realize that's
[1:12:22] where we live today that's what he's
[1:12:24] done for us when he moved in my offenses
[1:12:27] started to be rebuilt when he built in
[1:12:29] the loan started being mowed when he
[1:12:31] built in it changed my desires yeah
[1:12:34] change the way I looked even yeah
[1:12:37] right and the way I looked at life now
[1:12:39] it's more than a mental Faith it's a
[1:12:41] reality
[1:12:42] and so the king is in residence on the
[1:12:44] throne of your heart
[1:12:45] from his administration comes joy peace
[1:12:48] all the fruits of the spirit you're not
[1:12:50] trying to produce something by your own
[1:12:51] efforts it just flows out of you it
[1:12:53] flows back out of those Gates where you
[1:12:56] can touch somebody else and help them
[1:12:59] right so now the scripture says what
[1:13:02] says that the word is 90. so it's not
[1:13:04] something you have to reach out for
[1:13:05] somewhere else but the word is Snivy
[1:13:07] even in my mouth in my heart that is the
[1:13:10] word of faith which we preach that if
[1:13:12] Thou shalt confess with thy mouth the
[1:13:14] Lord Jesus and Shall Believe in thine
[1:13:17] heart that God hath raised him from the
[1:13:18] dead Thou shalt be saved what is that
[1:13:21] that's the faith that's the word of God
[1:13:22] that's thus saith the king
[1:13:27] right now he said we we just accept the
[1:13:30] word upon the basis God said so and that
[1:13:33] sets a stream between you and God
[1:13:36] right so now there's a connection
[1:13:38] he said every channel comes open between
[1:13:41] you and God then
[1:13:43] he said there's the battle the very
[1:13:46] first front line
[1:13:48] and so he makes the same and he said
[1:13:50] let's not use a 22 rifle brother Jeremy
[1:13:53] had a 22 rifle out here a while back and
[1:13:55] at 22 you couldn't even hear it sounded
[1:13:57] like a pellet gun because he had a
[1:13:58] suppressor on it maybe I shouldn't have
[1:14:00] said that
[1:14:01] out loud it was a 22 it wasn't a machine
[1:14:03] gun
[1:14:04] he had a suppressor on it hard to just
[1:14:06] make a little Pleak you know and I was I
[1:14:08] marveled at it you couldn't hardly tell
[1:14:10] you were firing a weapon but that's not
[1:14:11] the kind of weapon we use against the
[1:14:14] enemy we don't need a suppressor we
[1:14:17] don't need you know they don't worry
[1:14:18] about noise on the battlefield they
[1:14:20] don't out there monitoring the noise and
[1:14:21] monitoring the smoke and monitoring all
[1:14:23] that they want to make as much noise as
[1:14:25] possible remember when they invaded Iraq
[1:14:27] what they called it shock and awe
[1:14:29] right shock and all and if you watch the
[1:14:32] TV coverage back then uh when they've
[1:14:34] been invaded I remember watching it and
[1:14:36] the Palm was dropped and it just all
[1:14:37] over all over uh the city there that
[1:14:40] they were attacking they all just begin
[1:14:41] to drop and begin to explode in Iraq
[1:14:43] there and Saddam Hussein began to run
[1:14:46] why he found him hiding in a hole months
[1:14:48] later why did they do that they did that
[1:14:51] because they didn't want to just go in
[1:14:52] with a 22 rifle because the enemy's not
[1:14:54] scared of that when you go in with
[1:14:56] psychology when you go in with well
[1:14:58] somebody said something and I kind of
[1:14:59] believe maybe it's right that that what
[1:15:01] happens is the 22 rifle he said let's
[1:15:03] get an atomic bomb
[1:15:06] yeah let's do the job right
[1:15:09] if you're going to be a Christian you
[1:15:11] might as well be a happy Christian if
[1:15:13] you're going to be a Christian you might
[1:15:14] as well you might as well have control
[1:15:16] over your territory if you're going to
[1:15:18] be a Sovereign Nation if each one of us
[1:15:20] is a sovereign individual that Christ
[1:15:22] rules over if you're going to be a
[1:15:24] nation you've got to have borders yeah
[1:15:26] I'm not talking about politics now I'm
[1:15:29] talking about right here
[1:15:31] you've got to have boundaries you gotta
[1:15:33] have borders there's got to be there's
[1:15:34] got to be a front line you got to be
[1:15:36] fighting
[1:15:37] if you're not fighting you've already
[1:15:38] been taken over
[1:15:40] but there's got there's victory in that
[1:15:42] yeah because your weapon is much
[1:15:44] stronger than his
[1:15:46] and so he said let's get God's atomic
[1:15:48] bomb what is it brother Branham
[1:15:50] f-a-i-t-h in his word
[1:15:53] that's God's atomic bomb
[1:15:55] it blows sicknesses and Devils right and
[1:15:58] left it annihilates them it just
[1:16:01] destroys it disintegrates everything
[1:16:03] that's oh my oh I hope you're seeing it
[1:16:06] this morning it disintegrates everything
[1:16:08] that's ungodly
[1:16:11] when that palm of face drops in there
[1:16:13] with the word of God behind it it blows
[1:16:16] every devil every sickness every disease
[1:16:19] he said you say is that right brother
[1:16:20] Brandon then why does it on some and on
[1:16:22] others
[1:16:23] now listen he said it's because of the
[1:16:25] channel
[1:16:26] he said you can look out and see it
[1:16:29] but you've got to have it in here
[1:16:32] looking this away
[1:16:34] not out there looking in
[1:16:36] see you see well there's a battle going
[1:16:38] on I see it but it's not that Faith
[1:16:39] that's outside looking in but it's
[1:16:41] inside looking out
[1:16:43] he said you've got to have it in here
[1:16:45] looking this away not out there looking
[1:16:47] in you've got to be in looking out you
[1:16:49] can't come through reason you can't come
[1:16:51] through these other things you've got to
[1:16:53] come right down God's channel of it
[1:16:54] right into the soul aren't you glad
[1:16:57] aren't you glad that she's on the inside
[1:16:59] yeah Hallelujah
[1:17:02] oh that old song said he Jesus on the
[1:17:05] inside working on the outside whole what
[1:17:07] a change in my life
[1:17:09] amen amen he that is within you it's
[1:17:12] greater than he is in the world now he
[1:17:14] that is within you begins to make your
[1:17:16] body and mind come subject to the word
[1:17:20] your actions are transformed by the
[1:17:22] renewing of your mind there's a new King
[1:17:24] in Residence
[1:17:25] once the king is there all the channels
[1:17:28] are cleaned out by the Holy Spirit
[1:17:30] brother Brown use the example of a girl
[1:17:32] with Hodgkin's disease and her and her
[1:17:35] mother they come up in a prayer line but
[1:17:37] they were not Christians and he talks
[1:17:39] about it he said first he said accept
[1:17:41] Christ as your savior
[1:17:43] first he said you need to be a Christian
[1:17:44] and he says is he about that he said
[1:17:47] what was the matter he said you had to
[1:17:49] open the Channel first
[1:17:51] you've got to get the soldier the Holy
[1:17:53] Spirit placed at the Battlefront that
[1:17:56] takes God's word
[1:17:58] Oh my he is the word and he stands there
[1:18:01] there's nothing going to stop it then
[1:18:04] now he uses again the example of a
[1:18:06] boiler if you go back to greatest battle
[1:18:08] ever fought here's an example of a
[1:18:10] boiler now many of us don't know what a
[1:18:12] boiler is because we don't use very many
[1:18:13] of them around here some of the
[1:18:14] old-timers know what it is a boiler like
[1:18:16] you would put in a house
[1:18:18] right that would that would heat your
[1:18:19] house
[1:18:20] and the boiler has to have a flute
[1:18:23] because the boiler whatever is is
[1:18:25] running it whether it's steam I guess
[1:18:26] they're well they put coal in it or wood
[1:18:28] or whatever that it is the boiler gas
[1:18:31] even the boiler has to I it has to have
[1:18:34] an outlet or it'll explode
[1:18:37] right and so if there was a flu that
[1:18:39] would go outside the house you'd see a
[1:18:40] flu sticking out the wall of the house
[1:18:42] or out the basement or someplace
[1:18:45] so a boiler had to have an escape valve
[1:18:48] a flu in order to not in order to work
[1:18:51] correctly in order not to blow up let me
[1:18:53] say this there's got to be something
[1:18:55] actively in your life getting rid of the
[1:18:58] things the devil's trying to put in
[1:19:00] there
[1:19:00] the pressure's building up we live in
[1:19:02] that age of pressure we live in that
[1:19:04] eight of age of hardship we live in that
[1:19:06] age of mental oppression we live in that
[1:19:08] at the time that we live in it's a mind
[1:19:10] age and Satan is constantly bringing
[1:19:13] stuff in and you've got to have an
[1:19:15] outlet that's not stopped up right
[1:19:17] to get rid of it
[1:19:19] so a cluttered mind needs an escape
[1:19:23] valve
[1:19:25] huh you can't just live with all them
[1:19:28] thoughts forever
[1:19:30] you met hoarders right well maybe you
[1:19:32] haven't met them I I think I kind of am
[1:19:35] one but
[1:19:37] I just a minor case
[1:19:40] but if you're a hoarder what you do you
[1:19:43] can't bear to get rid of anything
[1:19:45] so your house starts to build up you've
[1:19:47] seen them maybe in their car they can't
[1:19:49] even get in it
[1:19:51] and just be full of magazines and say
[1:19:53] you're saying man that Magazine's from
[1:19:54] 1982. Popular Mechanics and and there
[1:19:58] ain't nothing you're going to ever need
[1:19:59] to know but they can't give like there's
[1:20:01] something psychological they just can't
[1:20:02] get rid of it they just can't get rid of
[1:20:05] it and so that's many times what we do
[1:20:07] spiritually if our mind gets cluttered
[1:20:09] like that we get things we can't you
[1:20:11] just need to get rid of that I don't
[1:20:12] have time to worry about all the people
[1:20:14] that don't like me come on
[1:20:17] come on right you don't have time to
[1:20:19] spend there and just just keeping that
[1:20:21] old that old Grudge around that'll
[1:20:23] malice around I don't think the devil
[1:20:25] gave that to you give it back
[1:20:27] there's got to be an outlet that thing
[1:20:29] will build up until you've got no room
[1:20:30] anymore you got no room for Joy Got No
[1:20:32] Room for peace Got No Room for the
[1:20:34] revelation of God's word because you're
[1:20:36] just full of stuff
[1:20:39] so he said you've got to clean it
[1:20:43] conscience memory thoughts laying aside
[1:20:46] everything coming from the inside out
[1:20:48] with that unadulterated word of God that
[1:20:51] it's the truth no matter if ten thousand
[1:20:53] died on this side today trusting ten
[1:20:56] thousand died on that side tomorrow
[1:20:57] trusting that has nothing to do with me
[1:21:00] I'm the individual I'm the one that's
[1:21:02] trusting I'm the one that believes it
[1:21:05] he said and we see back Yonder if we
[1:21:07] wanted to open up our channels then if
[1:21:09] we can and see we find this one and that
[1:21:11] one and this one and that one thousands
[1:21:13] of them testifying so he's saying you're
[1:21:15] an individual but if you could ever open
[1:21:16] up the channel as an individual you'd
[1:21:18] find you have brothers and sisters
[1:21:19] testify they've been through the same
[1:21:21] thing you went through it wasn't a
[1:21:23] unique situation but you thought it was
[1:21:25] but if you could get on the outside
[1:21:26] you'd see God did it for them he can do
[1:21:29] it for you all right
[1:21:30] she just gotta clean out that flu
[1:21:34] so there can be victory
[1:21:36] in the battle of the Mind
[1:21:39] see there's only
[1:21:40] a couple uh letter difference between
[1:21:43] victim and Victory
[1:21:46] right a victim is a sacrificial lamb
[1:21:48] that's what that word comes from
[1:21:50] in the Latin victim is a sacrifice
[1:21:54] but a Victor is one who benefits from
[1:21:57] that sacrifice
[1:22:00] yeah Jesus said we're more than
[1:22:02] conquerors
[1:22:04] oh my God see that Victory you're a
[1:22:06] Victor not a victim if you have a victim
[1:22:08] mentality you're never going to be able
[1:22:10] to overcome in the battle of the mind
[1:22:12] but if you have a Victor mentality you
[1:22:15] can overcome no matter what the devil
[1:22:16] sins there
[1:22:19] so victory in the battle of the mind is
[1:22:21] a promise from God Isaiah 26 3 that will
[1:22:23] keep him in perfect peace whose mind has
[1:22:25] stayed on thee because he trusteth in me
[1:22:27] Philippians 4 6 be careful for nothing
[1:22:29] but in everything by prayer and
[1:22:31] supplication with Thanksgiving let your
[1:22:33] requests be made known unto God there's
[1:22:35] the outlet the flu it's open he said the
[1:22:37] peace of God which passes all
[1:22:39] understanding shall keep your hearts and
[1:22:43] mines
[1:22:44] through Christ Jesus
[1:22:46] listen for God hath not given us second
[1:22:48] Timothy 1 7 the spirit of fear but a
[1:22:51] power and of love and of a sound mind
[1:22:56] are you with me now yeah
[1:22:58] so God can keep your mind God can heal
[1:22:59] your mind just like he can heal your
[1:23:01] body
[1:23:03] and and he can keep your mind now
[1:23:06] taking second Corinthians 10 3 for
[1:23:08] though we walk in the flesh we do not
[1:23:10] war in the flesh for the weapons of our
[1:23:11] Warfare not carnal that's where I want
[1:23:13] to go tonight
[1:23:14] but I'll just read it now so you can
[1:23:15] keep it in your mind but Mighty through
[1:23:17] God to the pulling down of strongholds
[1:23:19] casting down imaginations and every High
[1:23:21] thing that exalteth itself against the
[1:23:23] knowledge of God so anything that comes
[1:23:25] in at these Gates
[1:23:27] that we see its identity is against the
[1:23:29] word
[1:23:30] yeah and it shouldn't be there we cast
[1:23:32] it out we arrested
[1:23:35] right bringing into captivity every
[1:23:37] thought to The Obedience of Christ right
[1:23:41] and I've got 15 minutes left I want to
[1:23:43] spend it on this now
[1:23:45] many people like well
[1:23:48] I
[1:23:50] I never get to Victory
[1:23:52] I I've been suffering with this for 50
[1:23:54] years
[1:23:55] 30 years 20 years 10 years
[1:23:59] if you have faith
[1:24:01] you already have the victory
[1:24:05] right and one day one day
[1:24:08] that's going to be well
[1:24:10] but you understand that there's there
[1:24:12] you've got to get through that at some
[1:24:14] point and sometimes it's hard
[1:24:16] now brother Branham suffered with this
[1:24:18] himself
[1:24:20] when it comes to the battle of the mind
[1:24:21] and and specifically mental oppression
[1:24:25] and that's what he called it and he
[1:24:28] prayed for people with mental oppression
[1:24:30] and they got well
[1:24:32] and yet he struggled with it
[1:24:35] and it wasn't all the time but every
[1:24:37] seven years he said he went through I've
[1:24:39] talked to young people you go through a
[1:24:40] change you get married you have a child
[1:24:42] something happens you lose a home so you
[1:24:44] lose a job something will happen that's
[1:24:46] when the devil likes to work on you it's
[1:24:48] a junction before brother random every
[1:24:50] seven years was that conjunction he just
[1:24:52] goes through the blues he get he gets
[1:24:54] discouraged
[1:24:56] and and it's a real thing
[1:24:59] it's a real thing you can't just tell
[1:25:01] that well just get over it well yeah
[1:25:02] brother random could have just gotten
[1:25:04] over it he would have
[1:25:06] all right right but it took it took
[1:25:07] something it took a faith and then that
[1:25:09] Faith eventually Abraham held on for 25
[1:25:11] years but finally that Faith but let me
[1:25:14] say this let me say this that faith
[1:25:16] become reality that brother Branham did
[1:25:18] not give in to it even while he had it
[1:25:20] he still preached he still served the
[1:25:22] Lord he had that nervous breakdown he
[1:25:25] said during one of those times in the
[1:25:26] 40s he was away for one year but he came
[1:25:28] back yeah
[1:25:29] yeah he was off the field but he didn't
[1:25:30] quit serving the lord he didn't give in
[1:25:33] to the devil what'd he do he just kept
[1:25:34] coming back kept coming back kept coming
[1:25:36] back
[1:25:37] and that's what we have to do now
[1:25:39] he he talks about a lady he said I see a
[1:25:42] lady sitting right back through this
[1:25:43] away She's suffering she's got
[1:25:44] oppression she's got a breakdown it's a
[1:25:47] nervous condition a mental condition he
[1:25:49] saw if the woman could only catch it her
[1:25:50] name is Mrs Adams but leave with all
[1:25:52] your heart Jesus Christ will make you
[1:25:53] well he said Do you believe it with all
[1:25:55] your heart you accept your healing he
[1:25:56] said don't be scared
[1:25:58] here's the key to overcoming mental
[1:26:00] oppression don't be scared
[1:26:03] don't be scared he said if you're scared
[1:26:06] you'll always be in that estate
[1:26:08] it's a mental oppression but don't doubt
[1:26:11] believe with all your heart will you do
[1:26:13] it stand upon your feet Mrs Adams stand
[1:26:15] up on your feet stand up right here and
[1:26:16] be healed in the name of Jesus Christ he
[1:26:18] said I rebuke that devil that's
[1:26:20] bothering you to try to keep you from it
[1:26:21] yeah
[1:26:22] yeah the devil's lying to you
[1:26:25] you're gonna be all right go home and be
[1:26:27] well now
[1:26:28] oh my
[1:26:30] God again brother Brown said all right
[1:26:32] the thing of it is he said you're really
[1:26:33] the trouble is you're suffering from a
[1:26:34] nervous breakdown you're having some
[1:26:37] kind of mental Scruples in your mind
[1:26:39] it's oppression from Satan
[1:26:42] now there might be many reasons for it
[1:26:44] and but the answer is not psychology the
[1:26:48] answer is to order our mind by the word
[1:26:51] right because God made the mind he knows
[1:26:53] how to work in it
[1:26:54] he knows how to heal it
[1:26:56] so now he said you're having some kind
[1:26:59] of mental Scruples in your mind
[1:27:00] suppression from Satan this has been
[1:27:01] going on for some time it's cause your
[1:27:03] body to get weak your heart is weak
[1:27:06] you're in a very bad shape by this your
[1:27:10] whole family is just about into a
[1:27:11] breakdown
[1:27:14] and many times we've experienced that
[1:27:16] I've seen that how it spreads from one
[1:27:18] member to another because especially
[1:27:20] when it's a father or mother and it gets
[1:27:23] to spread through the family because
[1:27:24] it's a it's a mental oppression now he
[1:27:28] said sir you've been waiting for a word
[1:27:32] haven't you
[1:27:34] the brother said yes
[1:27:36] he said do you accept my word
[1:27:39] yes sir then in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:27:42] I send you home to be well
[1:27:45] I don't know brother Brandon may have
[1:27:46] had it might have had a vision and seen
[1:27:48] him home well and so he could do that
[1:27:49] but many times when brother Brandon
[1:27:51] would do that he explained it he said
[1:27:52] I'm not telling them I'm not healing
[1:27:55] them he said what I'm doing is I'm
[1:27:57] telling them what the Bible said
[1:27:59] right go home and be well he said that's
[1:28:02] what the Bible says if you believe
[1:28:04] you'll be well
[1:28:05] yeah you you waiting on her word will
[1:28:07] you accept the word from me I'll say to
[1:28:10] you this morning are you waiting on a
[1:28:11] word will you accept the word from the
[1:28:13] Lord will you accept the word from the
[1:28:15] Lord are you waiting on something to
[1:28:17] come some Supernatural thing to break in
[1:28:19] will you accept the word of the Lord
[1:28:21] that says thus saith the Lord God will
[1:28:23] give you peace in a time of trouble God
[1:28:25] will give you an answer when you need an
[1:28:27] answer all right thus saith the word
[1:28:30] thus Save the King amen
[1:28:33] amen
[1:28:35] now this is something brother Brandon
[1:28:36] has as well he says you don't know what
[1:28:38] I've suffered just mental oppression
[1:28:40] every seven years it's come all my life
[1:28:43] explains this on the wings of a snow
[1:28:45] white dove I don't have time to get deep
[1:28:47] into it this morning but he went to Mayo
[1:28:49] clinic trying to get help and when he
[1:28:51] was 38 years old
[1:28:53] I just realized I'm that age but Joel
[1:28:56] 38 years old but he was a prophet of God
[1:28:58] he had dealt in that nervous a spiritual
[1:29:00] realm I'll say this spiritual people are
[1:29:01] nervous and it's just something you have
[1:29:04] to deal with a lot of times musicians
[1:29:05] are nervous talented people are nervous
[1:29:07] and yet other people can I can be just
[1:29:09] calm and just go on in life and just
[1:29:12] steady well you need both kinds because
[1:29:14] if we were all just nervous wrecks all
[1:29:16] the time we'd have trouble
[1:29:18] all right we need some people that can
[1:29:20] be solid and and sit there and and and
[1:29:22] just listen to the word of God and take
[1:29:24] the word of God in and maybe they're not
[1:29:26] they're not up into up and down all the
[1:29:28] time and and excited but they're but
[1:29:30] they're solid they they know where they
[1:29:32] stand
[1:29:33] yeah we need people like that but we
[1:29:34] need some people that God works on in a
[1:29:36] spiritual realm and so if you're that
[1:29:38] way don't don't think that well if I
[1:29:40] could be more like that other person no
[1:29:42] you just be what God made you to be
[1:29:44] so but he went to Mayo clinic trying to
[1:29:46] get help and when he was there he had a
[1:29:49] vision of a squirrel
[1:29:50] now he said you'd have to understand my
[1:29:52] Ministry to understand this he said we
[1:29:54] had a vision of a squirrel and the
[1:29:57] squirrel like a weasel he said it was he
[1:30:00] said it was six inches long
[1:30:01] and it jumped into his mouth and jumped
[1:30:04] down his stomach and just was tearing
[1:30:06] him to peace for pieces from the inside
[1:30:08] and he comes out of the vision screaming
[1:30:10] and crying somebody help me
[1:30:12] and and this this is six inches long and
[1:30:15] he said the voice told him remember he's
[1:30:17] only six inches long
[1:30:19] oh
[1:30:22] he won't last forever
[1:30:25] he's only six inches long
[1:30:27] now
[1:30:28] but but the Brandon said Mayo brothers
[1:30:30] the next day examined me he said your
[1:30:31] father was an Irishman he drank your
[1:30:33] mother being a half Indian makes you
[1:30:34] almost a half breed this these doctors
[1:30:35] were something else
[1:30:37] doctors can be cold sometimes can't they
[1:30:40] said so you're just a nervous wreck
[1:30:41] until you'll never be out of it
[1:30:43] and said otherwise you're healthy but
[1:30:46] there's something in the soul that man
[1:30:47] cannot control
[1:30:49] oh that's where they were wrong
[1:30:51] said when a man dies you can't hold an
[1:30:52] autopsy because his Soul's gone he said
[1:30:54] well you'll you'll never get over it I
[1:30:57] said but sir I don't do nothing I said
[1:30:59] I'm happy he said that's right it's just
[1:31:01] out of the human grab bag I said you'll
[1:31:04] always have it he said oh what a
[1:31:06] discouraging thing
[1:31:08] because the doctor presented it to him
[1:31:10] as if there would never be victory yeah
[1:31:13] in this battle in his mind
[1:31:15] oh God
[1:31:16] I'm glad the prophet God was honest with
[1:31:19] us aren't you told us these things
[1:31:21] because he presented as if there would
[1:31:22] never be Victory and the devil's trying
[1:31:25] to tell you today there will never be
[1:31:26] Victory but remember he's only six
[1:31:28] inches long he cannot last forever
[1:31:32] you'll either be healed here you'll be
[1:31:33] healed over there you might as well
[1:31:35] worship God yeah might as well thank God
[1:31:37] for your healing
[1:31:39] I said but
[1:31:40] but sir I I don't do nothing I'm happy
[1:31:42] he told him that oh what a discouraging
[1:31:44] thing now his mother had a dream of six
[1:31:46] white doves
[1:31:48] but the brandman's mother a dream of six
[1:31:50] white doves and then he realized there
[1:31:51] had to be a seventh somewhere and I've
[1:31:54] stood out there brother Bill in Dove
[1:31:56] Cove where brother Brandon gets out in
[1:31:57] that Cove and in Sabino Canyon it's a
[1:32:00] very pretty Place very peaceful shaded
[1:32:02] by the rock walls of the canyon
[1:32:05] and you have stood in that Cove and and
[1:32:07] thought about this he was in that Cove
[1:32:09] he saw the seventh white dove
[1:32:12] the seventh death
[1:32:13] and then I think it was the next day and
[1:32:16] you forgive me if I've got some of my
[1:32:17] facts wrong but I just kind of have to
[1:32:19] move through this now I I couldn't can't
[1:32:22] read the quotes for you we'd be here all
[1:32:23] day
[1:32:24] but
[1:32:25] he saw that six inch squirrel
[1:32:27] and he said it was laying on the ground
[1:32:30] full of choya cactus
[1:32:32] it had jumped and he said what had
[1:32:34] happened is I love I love brother
[1:32:36] random's Faith he said it had jumped and
[1:32:38] it tried to hit him
[1:32:40] remember every seven years that thing
[1:32:41] hit him
[1:32:42] right but this time
[1:32:45] oh God you say well that thing's
[1:32:48] bothered me over and over and over and
[1:32:49] over again and every time it does it
[1:32:51] brother being every time it keeps me out
[1:32:53] of church every time it every time I
[1:32:55] give into it every time that Temptation
[1:32:56] comes I just have to give in no there's
[1:32:58] going to come a time when it'll be the
[1:33:00] last time and that was the last time
[1:33:02] amen
[1:33:04] it was the last time he said but I'm
[1:33:06] older than I've done with it all my life
[1:33:07] brother Adam was almost about to go home
[1:33:09] it's one of his last sermons he was
[1:33:11] believing for his healing God gave him
[1:33:13] his healing
[1:33:14] but he told him you won't have to deal
[1:33:16] with this anymore
[1:33:18] Hallelujah it missed him and it hit the
[1:33:21] cactus now you know brother Brandon
[1:33:23] begins to after seeing that he's still
[1:33:26] sick
[1:33:27] he still has the battle going on
[1:33:31] but he's gained the victory in the mind
[1:33:35] he still felt blue he still felt
[1:33:38] discouraged but he had that in his mind
[1:33:40] he had gained the victory he said
[1:33:41] somehow I know I'll tell you before it
[1:33:44] happens he said the doctor's a good
[1:33:45] doctor no doubt I think he's a fine man
[1:33:47] but I know I'm going to be over it it's
[1:33:49] done it's finished I'm gonna be well
[1:33:53] Hallelujah well I wonder if we could
[1:33:55] come to that this morning I know it's
[1:33:57] going to be over with it's done I'm
[1:33:59] finished it's going to be well
[1:34:01] I'm gonna be well I'm not gonna deal
[1:34:03] with that no more I've dealt with that
[1:34:04] nervousness all my life but this is it
[1:34:07] if you could ever get that faith in your
[1:34:09] heart
[1:34:11] he's defeated me that way over and over
[1:34:13] again but not today Satan not today it's
[1:34:16] gonna be okay
[1:34:19] [Applause]
[1:34:21] huh
[1:34:24] later that night during the prayer line
[1:34:26] he prays for a woman with the same
[1:34:27] problem you know a lot of times we think
[1:34:29] well
[1:34:31] brother Ben there's
[1:34:33] there's uh you know I'm not a prophet so
[1:34:36] what worked for brother Brandon won't
[1:34:37] work for me I'll say this you got
[1:34:39] something greater than a vision
[1:34:41] that's what brother Brandon taught us
[1:34:43] you have something greater than a vision
[1:34:45] you have faith in the word
[1:34:47] but listen how he deals with his sister
[1:34:48] that same night
[1:34:50] and it was an old-fashioned prayer line
[1:34:51] where they come and told Brother Brown
[1:34:52] what was wrong with him he prayed for
[1:34:53] him so he didn't use the discernment
[1:34:55] often in that line he had an
[1:34:58] old-fashioned we called an old-fashioned
[1:34:59] prayer line
[1:35:00] he said depression fear I know the
[1:35:02] sister speaks to brother Brandon poor
[1:35:03] little thing
[1:35:04] she said she's never seen peace in life
[1:35:07] the same thing that I
[1:35:09] said can't sleep nervous tension
[1:35:13] dear God bear me record Lord that I've
[1:35:16] told the truth how I feel for this
[1:35:19] little woman
[1:35:20] I pray God that you'll send to her
[1:35:22] tonight that streak of Faith from above
[1:35:25] that knows that you are obligated to
[1:35:27] your word and you'll keep every word
[1:35:32] May the god of Heaven take this fear
[1:35:34] away from my sister and I obey you he
[1:35:37] said by laying hands upon her and
[1:35:40] condemning it in the name of Jesus
[1:35:42] Christ may it come out of her
[1:35:45] he said now look sister you believe me
[1:35:47] now if you can start from right here by
[1:35:49] the cross
[1:35:51] from this night deny you got it
[1:35:54] you said my brother Ben I don't have a
[1:35:55] six inch squirrel I don't have a vision
[1:35:57] but from this moment on if you start
[1:35:59] right here by the cross deny that you
[1:36:02] got it see go on saying I haven't got it
[1:36:05] no more and it will leave you
[1:36:07] why brother Brandon realized he had had
[1:36:10] the victory by faith this woman could
[1:36:12] have the victory by faith
[1:36:14] he didn't tell her she needed a
[1:36:15] supernatural sign he didn't tell her but
[1:36:17] if she could get a victory in her mind
[1:36:19] it was over
[1:36:20] I don't know about you this morning as I
[1:36:22] close the musicians come I don't know
[1:36:24] about you but I'm tired of the devil
[1:36:25] getting free reign in my mind I'm tired
[1:36:28] of him coming over the walls I'm tired
[1:36:30] of letting him in at the gates I'm going
[1:36:32] to close them off I'm going to shut them
[1:36:33] up I'm gonna kick him out amen there's
[1:36:36] going to be a victory in my mind I may
[1:36:38] not see it in my body yet I may not see
[1:36:40] it in my children yet I may not see it
[1:36:42] in my circumstances yet but in my mind
[1:36:44] there will be Victory because I know
[1:36:45] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:36:47] forever
[1:36:48] he'll come again but I'll defeat him
[1:36:51] again
[1:36:52] every time that thing will miss me and
[1:36:54] it'll destroy itself
[1:36:57] oh Hallelujah
[1:36:58] quit messing around with the 22 rifle
[1:37:00] trying to get rid of it well brother Ben
[1:37:02] I win and I tried to make myself feel a
[1:37:04] little bit better and a little bit of
[1:37:06] self-care quit messing around with the
[1:37:07] 22 rifle
[1:37:09] drop the atomic bomb of faith on your
[1:37:11] enemy
