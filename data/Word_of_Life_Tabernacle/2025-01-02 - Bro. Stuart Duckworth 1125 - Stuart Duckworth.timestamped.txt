[46:04] the kingdom of God I love this here it
[46:06] says and such were some of you but ye
[46:10] are washed but ye are Sanctified but you
[46:13] are justified in the name of the Lord
[46:15] Jesus and by the spirit of our God Amen
[46:19] you could be seated
[46:21] here this
[46:23] evening amen may the Lord just bless his
[46:25] word we just want to speak on the
[46:28] subject of filtered and and pure and
[46:30] holy and stabilized and I was going to
[46:33] try to get to another part of it and I
[46:35] just don't think we can get there but um
[46:37] just pray the Lord would help us here
[46:39] tonight we look at that word filtered is
[46:42] to remove unwanted elements to be
[46:45] filtered is to be subjected to that that
[46:49] process and that process produces
[46:52] something or someone that can be desired
[46:56] for for use amen amen do you want to be
[46:59] filtered tonight do you want to be
[47:00] someone that that God can use and that's
[47:03] someone that that God desires
[47:05] amen amen and a a filtered Christian
[47:09] amen is is Justified is we're Justified
[47:12] we're Sanctified we're filled with the
[47:13] Holy Ghost and a filtered Christian is
[47:16] justified by faith and and what God has
[47:18] already done amen and your faith reaches
[47:21] out to that and that's the process of of
[47:24] being filtered and the process of of the
[47:27] Holy Ghost and that work in in your life
[47:29] and so it's already done and mean and
[47:32] it's part of that process he's already
[47:34] saved you but you've got to recognize
[47:37] the price that that has been paid amen
[47:40] and so part of the process I mean we're
[47:42] Sanctified by the blood of Jesus we're
[47:45] Sanctified Amen brother said it's a
[47:48] bleeding word the word bled for you and
[47:50] we we'll try to get to that later on
[47:52] Amen we're Sanctified by the blood amen
[47:55] and we're cleaned up that that word
[47:57] Sanctified is it's a dual meaning it's
[47:59] cleaned up and set aside for
[48:03] service and so we look here uh then
[48:06] we're we're born again we're baptized
[48:08] into the body of Christ by the spirit of
[48:11] God Amen that that's that's being filled
[48:13] with the Holy Ghost being born again uh
[48:15] the god coming down and and accepting
[48:18] your faith amen and and being filtered
[48:20] in such a way that God comes down and
[48:23] gives you the Holy
[48:24] Ghost Lord Ephesians
[48:27] 2 you who were dead in sin and
[48:30] trespasses we walked according the Bible
[48:32] says to the course of this world
[48:34] fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and
[48:37] of the mind and we're by Nature the
[48:39] children of Wrath but Ephesians 2:4 says
[48:41] but God rich in Mercy who is rich in
[48:45] Mercy for his great love wherewith he
[48:47] loved us even when we were dead even
[48:51] when we were dead in sin and trespasses
[48:53] had he quickened us together with Christ
[48:56] amen by grace are you saved amen God
[48:59] come down in his grace come down in his
[49:01] Mercy amen there's no no worse condition
[49:04] in being dead amen but the Holy Ghost
[49:07] amen the process amen come down and
[49:09] raised you up Quicken you to life thank
[49:13] you Lord my voice is going to go I don't
[49:15] know if we can turn me up or or help me
[49:18] out here a little
[49:21] bit yes sir and God says and or brother
[49:24] R says here rather in the God who is
[49:26] Rich and and mercy he made a provision
[49:29] for those who wants to be redeemed he
[49:31] made a provision for those who wants to
[49:33] be healed amen who wants to be healed
[49:35] tonight amen who wants to be fully
[49:38] redeemed here tonight amen and then
[49:41] because he did this it makes him rich in
[49:43] Mercy and he's always been rich in Mercy
[49:45] it must be and if you refuse this
[49:48] there's nothing left but the Judgment
[49:50] because sin must be judged amen we can't
[49:54] go go meet God in in our own dirty uh
[49:57] dirty lives we've got to be filtered
[49:59] we've got to be filtered by the spirit
[50:01] of God and by the word of God come on
[50:04] and so uh filtered here you know you can
[50:08] think about uh you can find water just
[50:11] about anywhere you can find water in in
[50:14] a Muddy Pond and am me there's ditches
[50:16] full of water but but that water is
[50:19] undrinkable and if you drink enough of
[50:22] that water that water will make you sick
[50:26] it maybe that water looks good it looks
[50:28] clear it looks it looks like it would be
[50:31] uh uh refreshing but there are germs and
[50:33] there are parasites and all kinds of
[50:36] filthiness potentially in that water
[50:38] depending on where you're
[50:40] at but if you can filter that
[50:43] water if you can filter that water that
[50:46] substance amen and any old filter won't
[50:48] do an oil filter won't work a filter to
[50:53] filter oil uh and air filter won't work
[50:56] but it's takes the right kind of filter
[50:58] amen a filter designed Amen to remove
[51:01] amen the filth and the grime amen a
[51:04] filter Amen to remove sin and unbelief
[51:07] amen it takes a genuine water filter to
[51:10] produce cure Pure Clean Water that's
[51:15] drinkable Amen in water we got to have
[51:17] water right water is life sustaining you
[51:20] can go without food you can go without
[51:23] certain things but we must have water we
[51:26] have to have water because life water is
[51:29] life sustaining right that's good you
[51:31] cannot live without
[51:34] water one time the warrior David the

[56:48] he was sitting around amen drinking some
[56:51] old stagnant water come on he said
[56:54] Palestine had a lot of bad water
[56:56] but Bethlehem was known for its good
[56:59] water oh thank you Lord you see the well
[57:02] that Bethlehem was a predestinated well
[57:05] amen filtered and pure by God's
[57:09] design filtered and pure by God's design
[57:11] amen and so David amen David amen with
[57:15] this well upon his heart amen he
[57:18] remembered taking his sheep to that will
[57:21] and oh oh the sweet how sweet that water
[57:24] was and how it quenched his thirst
[57:27] thank you Lord and I like this brother R
[57:29] said oh he thought in his mind he
[57:32] thought in his mind if I only had a
[57:35] drink from that well so David sitting
[57:37] here he's dwelling upon his thoughts
[57:39] he's dwelling upon this well he's
[57:41] dwelling upon that clean pure water that
[57:44] God had there in that
[57:46] land amen so he's sitting there he's
[57:49] dwelling upon these thoughts brother R
[57:51] said he remembered the days of his
[57:53] childhood and his memories and the
[57:55] victories that he had
[57:57] he remembered these things and now he's
[57:59] in a battle brother R said he's in a
[58:01] battle there and he's between fires
[58:04] there's Philistines are all around
[58:06] that's right and me a prophet would look
[58:08] into that and he said there he's in
[58:09] between fires he's not just sitting

[58:13] battle amen he was rejected amen he was
[58:16] out out there all alone amen and there

[58:31] out oh if I could have a drink from the
[58:34] will at Bethlehem oh my it was more than
[58:37] just a thought but now amen he had spoke
[58:40] it forth amen he wanted he desired a
[58:43] drink from that well Amen brother R said
[58:46] they couldn't interpret his thoughts but
[58:48] the least of his desire was their
[58:50] command amen amen we can't read God's
[58:53] mind but God sent us his mind in this
[58:55] hour
[58:56] he sent us amen the back part of his
[58:58] mind amen that we could understand that

[1:18:46] authority under Malachi
[1:18:49] 4 I want to read something here just to
[1:18:52] kind of stabilize your faith in this
[1:18:55] hour because it seems people are tossed
[1:18:58] so much and we can all be you know
[1:19:01] tossed with things that come along but
[1:19:04] we're we're meant to be steady we're
[1:19:05] meant to be
[1:19:07] stable and not moved about with every
[1:19:09] wind that would
[1:19:11] blow he says here in the L in church AG
[1:19:14] Exposition Church ages he says who then
[1:19:16] will have the power of infallibility
[1:19:18] which is to be restored in this last age
[1:19:21] for this last age is going to be to go
[1:19:24] back to manifesting the pure word BR
[1:19:27] that means we will have the word once
[1:19:29] again as it was perfectly given and
[1:19:32] perfectly understood in the days of Paul
[1:19:34] I tell you who will have it it will be a
[1:19:36] prophet as thoroughly Vindicated or even
[1:19:38] more thoroughly Vindicated than than any
[1:19:41] prophet in all the ages from Enoch to
[1:19:43] this day because this man will of
[1:19:45] necessity have the Capstone prophetic
[1:19:48] Ministry and God will show him forth he
[1:19:51] won't need to speak for himself but God
[1:19:54] will speak for him by the voice of the
[1:19:56] son amen amen we have come under that
[1:20:00] under that voice amen not just under a
[1:20:04] sign of something to stir the hearts of
[1:20:06] the people but we have come under the
[1:20:08] voice of that sign of that that Capstone
[1:20:11] prophetic Ministry amen where
[1:20:14] infallibility was restored where when
[1:20:17] something was said it was so when
[1:20:20] something was said it would be amen and
[1:20:23] it brought back forth amen amen amen an
[1:20:26] infallibility and you say well was
[1:20:28] brother brenham's word every word God no
[1:20:31] that couldn't be because he was a man
[1:20:33] just like you and I but he was a
[1:20:34] redeemed man that God could use amen
[1:20:37] amen and we needed the infallibility
[1:20:39] Amen to bring a pure word we needed that
[1:20:42] infallibility not to make a man God but
[1:20:44] we need that infallibility Amen to take
[1:20:47] away the error that had come through the
[1:20:48] church ages amen that we could that we
[1:20:51] could have in this last day a group that
[1:20:53] would rise up amen and be that pure word
[1:20:55] bride that's why the infallibility came
[1:20:57] not to glorify the man amen but to
[1:21:00] produce a bride for Jesus
[1:21:06] Christ let that stabilize you oh
[1:21:10] yes come on let that let that stabilize
[1:21:13] you yes sir that's good that God would
[1:21:17] so vindicate a
[1:21:18] Ministry not for that man but for you on
[1:21:23] he done it for you I and that Ministry
[1:21:27] would not point to themselves but point
[1:21:29] us to the scripture right that's right
[1:21:32] point us to the Lamb of God said I can't
[1:21:34] open the seals I can't do these things
[1:21:37] but it would take the Lamb of God to
[1:21:38] come and so that's the ministry that God
[1:21:41] gave to you and I amen amen that that to
[1:21:44] point us to the Lamb of God they could
[1:21:45] loose the seals amen they could break
[1:21:48] the seals amen and they could reveal the
[1:21:49] Mysteries amen amen point us to the Lamb
[1:21:52] of God Amen this is John the Baptist
[1:21:54] that would take away the sin from our
[1:21:57] hearts oh thank you Lord to a Ministry
[1:22:01] that would not build his own
[1:22:02] kingdom but his purpose was to see
[1:22:05] restored a true spiritual
[1:22:07] relationship amen between God and
[1:22:11] man amen aren't you thankful for that
[1:22:14] Ministry it wasn't for himself it was
[1:22:16] for you amen come
[1:22:19] on one to an age come on one Ministry
[1:22:24] like that to an
[1:22:25] age go on here just something to
[1:22:28] stabilize you questions and answers he
[1:22:32] says 1 Corinthians 13 says this he says
[1:22:35] when that which is perfect is is come
[1:22:38] that which is in part shall be done away
[1:22:40] so all these little things of jumping up
[1:22:42] down like a kid and trying to talk in
[1:22:45] tongues all these other things when that
[1:22:47] which is perfect and he says we do have
[1:22:49] today by God's help come on not me not
[1:22:54] not not my Ministry but by God's help
[1:22:56] the perfect interpretation of the word
[1:22:59] with Divine Vindication amen it was
[1:23:02] brought to you and I amen that our faith
[1:23:04] could be settled that we could have the
[1:23:06] right kind of faith that we could see
[1:23:08] who we were in the word I said this is

[1:23:56] brought to
[1:23:58] us
[1:24:00] amen Ephesians 5:22 I'll try to hurry
[1:24:04] here I really wanted to start out with
[1:24:07] this scripture right
[1:24:12] here come
[1:24:15] on oh Jesus help
[1:24:20] me it says
[1:24:22] here it says here
[1:24:25] wives submit yourselves under your own
[1:24:27] husband Lord forgive me I'm sorry I'm
[1:24:32] sorry Lord Jesus help
[1:24:36] me
[1:24:38] bless why submit yourselves and your own
[1:24:40] husbands as unto the Lord for the
[1:24:44] husband is the head of the wife even as
[1:24:46] Christ is the head of the church and he
[1:24:47] is the savior of the
[1:24:49] body therefore as the church is subject
[1:24:52] unto Christ so let the wives be to their
[1:24:54] own husbands and everything husbands
[1:24:57] love your wives even as Christ also
[1:24:59] loved the church and gave himself for it
[1:25:02] that he might sanctify it and cleanse it
[1:25:05] with the washing of the Water by the
[1:25:07] word that he might present it to himself
[1:25:09] he's going to present it to himself a
[1:25:13] glorious church not having spot or
[1:25:14] wrinkle or any such thing but that it
[1:25:17] should be holy and without blemish amen

[1:25:38] that he is the head of the home and true
[1:25:41] headship and Leadership brings a
[1:25:43] stability to the wife to the family to
[1:25:46] to the ones under him amen and as the
