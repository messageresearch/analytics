[46:07] i the son of man am
[46:10] it matters what you say about him
[46:12] what you believe about him
[46:15] they said some say that thou art john
[46:16] the baptist some elias and others
[46:18] jeremias are one of the prophets
[46:21] he saith unto them but whom say ye that
[46:23] i am
[46:24] and simon peter answered and said thou
[46:26] art the christ
[46:28] the son of the living god
[46:31] and jesus answered and said unto him
[46:33] blessed art thou simon barjona
[46:35] for flesh and blood hath not revealed it
[46:37] unto thee
[46:38] but my father which is in heaven
[46:41] and i say also unto thee that thou art
[46:43] peter
[46:44] and upon this rock i will build my
[46:47] church and the gates of hell shall not
[46:49] prevail against it
[46:51] i will give unto thee the keys of the
[46:53] kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou
[46:55] shalt bind on earth shall be bound in
[46:57] heaven
[46:58] and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth
[47:01] shall be loosed
[47:02] in heaven i pray the lord would add his
[47:04] blessing to the word you may be seated
[47:10] i want to speak to you this morning on
[47:12] power to bind him
[47:14] the worst or any
[47:16] power to bind him the worst or any i had
[47:20] mentioned to you about the message
[47:21] paradox that i've been listening to
[47:24] the one that brother branham preached in
[47:25] december of 1961
[47:28] he relates at the beginning of that
[47:29] sermon a
[47:31] uh a story or or a vision that he had
[47:34] had
[47:35] and he said it was about three o'clock
[47:37] in the morning
[47:38] he said i'd gotten up and i looked in
[47:40] front of me and looked like i was
[47:41] standing on the map of palestine i was
[47:44] coming down to the jordan i watch he's
[47:46] standing on a map so you know it has a
[47:48] spiritual significance he said i was
[47:51] coming down to the jordan he said and as
[47:53] i drew near the river i looked back and
[47:55] seen which way i had come and i was
[47:58] two-thirds of the way there
[48:00] to the jordan he said and i looked
[48:02] across jordan and i said
[48:05] oh praise god
[48:07] just on the other side
[48:09] is where all the promises lay
[48:13] every promise lays
[48:15] in the promised land
[48:17] now remember this is december of 1961.
[48:20] now i want you to
[48:21] to notice today and i want to make this
[48:24] statement right now that i believe we're
[48:26] living in the land
[48:28] today where all the promises lay
[48:31] we're not two-thirds of the way there
[48:32] and you know that he had had the first
[48:34] pull of his ministry the second pull of
[48:36] his ministry but it would be the third
[48:38] poll that brought him all the way
[48:40] into the promised land and and so he
[48:43] said that's where every promise lays and
[48:46] so understanding the opening of the word
[48:49] and what god has done for us in this day
[48:51] isn't just some abstract theology but
[48:54] it's actually knowing that god has made
[48:57] himself present in our day and he's
[49:00] actually brought every promise to become
[49:03] a reality to us that we don't have to
[49:05] fear anything
[49:08] right we don't have to fear any spirit
[49:10] we don't have to fear any any any
[49:13] theology
[49:14] we don't have to fear any idea of man
[49:17] but we we have a god who is able to
[49:20] overcome everything that comes our way
[49:23] how many believe that this morning
[49:25] greater is he that is in you than he
[49:27] that is in the world your our god is
[49:29] able and what does the third pole do
[49:31] what does the opening of the word do we
[49:33] use those terms we've come all the way
[49:36] into the promised land right
[49:38] do you believe that this morning
[49:41] amen
[49:43] now
[49:45] the word is amen in case you've
[49:46] forgotten it
[49:48] amen
[49:50] and so brother branham said then when i
[49:52] come into the vision again so he comes
[49:54] back into the vision
[49:57] he said it seemed that i was lifted up
[49:59] and sitting on a narrow highway with
[50:01] some brother i never knew who the
[50:03] brother was i looked around and seemed
[50:05] like everybody was afraid i said what's
[50:07] everybody so afraid of
[50:09] and a voice came and said there is such
[50:11] danger in these days how many could say
[50:13] amen to that this morning
[50:15] there's such danger in these days
[50:18] you have to be careful because death is
[50:20] all around us
[50:22] yet it doesn't have to affect us
[50:25] but it is out there
[50:27] and i'm talking now with spiritual death
[50:30] it's everywhere death is everywhere
[50:32] you've got to be careful there's such
[50:34] danger in these days there's a great
[50:37] hideous thing
[50:38] that's death when it strikes you he said
[50:41] and i heard the weeds mashing down and i
[50:44] looked and here come a huge monster
[50:46] snake crawling through the weeds
[50:49] that's not a
[50:51] vision that's a nightmare
[50:54] a huge monster snake i i don't think
[50:57] there's such a thing as a good snake my
[50:59] son tells me that there is and he's
[51:01] always trying to pick him up by the tail
[51:02] and
[51:03] and tells us so there's certain ones we
[51:05] should leave in the yard and my wife and
[51:07] i agree we've come to an agreement that
[51:09] that there's no such thing as a good
[51:11] snake in our yard so we do everything we
[51:13] can to keep them out
[51:15] but but when you look at that and begin
[51:17] to
[51:18] you realize that this was something that
[51:19] was represented something it represented
[51:22] death
[51:23] he said i thought now knowing this is
[51:25] vision he said i'll see what this animal
[51:27] or this beast is
[51:29] he said he crawled up on the highway and
[51:32] as soon as i got sight of him i knew it
[51:34] was a mamba now he said a mamba is an
[51:37] african snake which is the most deadly
[51:39] bite of all things there is there's
[51:41] nothing as poison as a mamba and the
[51:44] snake of course represents sin
[51:46] and death so what did god show him
[51:48] brother branham having been in africa
[51:50] knowing what the worst snake was the
[51:52] worst land snake in the world is the
[51:55] mamba if it bites you you'll only live
[51:57] for a few minutes
[51:59] and so he shows him the very worst that
[52:01] there was
[52:02] and and says this is what's out there
[52:04] stalking the highway
[52:06] right and this represents sin and death
[52:09] he said and here he was on the highway i
[52:11] thought well this is it
[52:13] so i looked at him and he looked angry
[52:15] at me and he licked his tongue and here
[52:17] he come he said but when he got right
[52:20] close to me he said he would run up fast
[52:23] and then he would get slower and slower
[52:26] and just quiver and stop and then
[52:29] something would hold him off he couldn't
[52:31] bite me
[52:32] he said and he would turn around on the
[52:34] other side try to approach from this
[52:36] side he would get back and get a start
[52:38] and swish right towards me get slower
[52:40] and slower and slower and then to a stop
[52:42] he said then he would shake like that
[52:44] and move back he couldn't strike me he
[52:47] said then he turned and looked at my
[52:48] friend and away he went after my friend
[52:51] and this is always the way the devil
[52:52] does by the way if he can't get you
[52:54] he'll try to get those around you
[52:56] he said he he turned and looked at my
[52:58] friend the way he went after my friend i
[52:59] seen my friend just jumping away in the
[53:01] air over him and over him and over him
[53:03] trying and the thing was tracking at him
[53:05] i must have scared the poor man to death
[53:08] he said i thought oh if it ever hits him
[53:10] it'll be instant death
[53:12] he said no wonder everybody is so scared
[53:16] he said and i threw my hands up and i
[53:19] said oh god have mercy on my brother
[53:21] and just then the serpent turned to me
[53:23] when i said that and looked at me again
[53:25] and a voice came from above me and said
[53:27] you have been given power to bind him
[53:30] the worst
[53:32] right this is the worst snake
[53:34] this is as bad as it gets
[53:37] huh
[53:39] oh i hope you hear me this morning
[53:41] it's the worst thing
[53:43] that you could possibly face in the wild
[53:46] as far as a snake the worst snake that
[53:48] there was
[53:50] he said
[53:51] but you've been given power to bind him
[53:53] yes
[53:54] the worst or any
[53:57] right
[53:58] amen and i said well god what must i do
[54:02] he said there's one thing you must do
[54:04] you must be more sincere
[54:07] i said well god forgive me for my
[54:09] insincerity let me have sincerity when i
[54:11] raised up my hands to him again there
[54:13] was a great something came over me just
[54:15] lifted me up seemed like that my whole
[54:18] body was charged with something and i
[54:20] looked at the serpent and then he
[54:21] started towards me and he couldn't do it
[54:23] yet and i said satan in the name of the
[54:25] lord jesus christ i bind you and the
[54:27] serpent a blue smoke flew out of him he
[54:29] curled up he said made that sign like a
[54:31] capital s made backwards and and a sign
[54:34] an and signed he said and means buying
[54:38] this one
[54:39] oh i love this or anything below him
[54:43] behind this one or anything below him
[54:46] because he was the worst he said blue
[54:48] smoke fell out of him his tail choked
[54:50] his own self to death around his head
[54:52] and the brother was free and just then a
[54:54] voice came again and said you can unbind
[54:56] him also so i said then satan that i
[54:58] might know i unbind you and when it did
[55:01] he started coming to life again wiggling
[55:03] and i said i bind you back in the name
[55:04] of jesus christ when it did the smoke
[55:06] flew out of him again he choked himself
[55:08] right back again and turned to crystal
[55:10] he said then when he did that that voice
[55:12] said now you must be more sincere than
[55:14] what you are to do this
[55:16] he said then it left me and i was
[55:19] standing in the room now i want us to
[55:20] kind of lay that there as a foundation
[55:23] and go on now brother branham continues
[55:26] to preach on a paradox and
[55:29] what it was he said it was incredible
[55:31] but true it's the same thing as a
[55:33] miracle he said it's incredible but it
[55:36] actually is a fact he said later and
[55:38] later in the message he goes back and he
[55:40] ties this vision to our text with which
[55:43] is matthew 16 19 when jesus says
[55:46] who do you say that i am
[55:48] and he said thou art the christ the son
[55:50] of the living god so and then he says
[55:52] you've been you if the things that you
[55:55] bind on earth will be bound in heaven
[55:56] whatever you bind on earth will be bound
[55:58] in heaven and brother branham said oh he
[56:00] said that's what the vision was now
[56:02] so jesus says that again in matthew 18
[56:04] and 18 he said verily i say unto you
[56:07] whatsoever you shall bind on earth shall
[56:09] be bound in heaven and whatsoever you
[56:11] shall loose on earth shall be loosed in
[56:12] heaven and verse 19 again i say unto you
[56:15] that if two of you shall agree on earth
[56:17] as touching anything that they shall ask
[56:20] it shall be done for them of my father
[56:21] which is in heaven do we really believe
[56:23] that this morning
[56:25] do we really believe it
[56:27] now look he said it shall be done for
[56:28] them for where two or three are gathered
[56:30] together in my name there am i in the
[56:33] midst of them as we've talked about
[56:34] recently
[56:36] now this scripture was manifested
[56:38] literally now think about it in the
[56:40] upper room because the bible tells us
[56:42] we've been over that as well recently
[56:44] the bible tells us that they were all
[56:46] with one accord in one place there were
[56:48] two or three gathered together
[56:50] they were there in his name
[56:52] and they were agreeing together they
[56:54] were in one accord as to what should be
[56:56] done
[56:57] so they were there in the upper room and
[56:59] this scripture literally come to pass
[57:00] that the holy spirit fell
[57:03] and now remember what jesus told him he
[57:05] said i'm going to give you the keys
[57:06] plural
[57:08] to the kingdom
[57:09] giving you the keys to the kingdom so
[57:12] peter takes one of those keys and he has
[57:14] the key and what a key is is a key
[57:17] unlocks
[57:18] a mystery
[57:20] a key unlocks a mystery there's a
[57:22] mystery behind the door and when you
[57:24] unlock the door then
[57:26] it's revealed to you what's inside the
[57:27] room
[57:29] right if your house was locked and i'd
[57:31] never been in it if you had the key to
[57:33] it you unlocked the door and then when
[57:35] you walk in you're able to see all the
[57:37] things that are on the inside
[57:39] and so peter has the keys to the kingdom
[57:42] so now watch what happens here the holy
[57:44] ghost fell in acts 2 37
[57:46] and peter has preached his sermon it
[57:48] says now when they heard this they were
[57:50] pricked in their heart and said to peter
[57:51] and to the rest of the apostles men and
[57:53] brethren what shall we do
[57:56] and peter said unto them repent and be
[57:58] baptized every one of you in the name of
[58:00] jesus christ for the remission of sins
[58:02] and you shall receive the gift of the
[58:04] holy ghost what was he doing he was
[58:05] using the key
[58:07] to unlock the door for these people
[58:11] he was unbinding
[58:14] now think about he said i've given you
[58:15] the power to bind the worst or to unbind
[58:17] it
[58:19] the power to bind the worst or any now
[58:22] here is simon peter taking the keys
[58:25] and using his scriptural authority to
[58:27] unbind it
[58:29] he's brother branham said it this way he
[58:31] said now they said men and brethren what
[58:32] can we do he said that's the question
[58:35] and he said how are we going to get it
[58:37] who's got the keys
[58:39] come here simon
[58:41] you got the keys pull them off your side
[58:44] oh my you believe we still have the keys
[58:46] today
[58:47] still have those same keys
[58:50] right we can tell somebody say well how
[58:52] can i be saved repent and be baptized
[58:55] every one of you in the name of jesus
[58:56] christ that key still works
[58:59] right it's still the same
[59:01] so now he said who's got the keys come
[59:03] here simon you've got the keys pull them
[59:05] off your side what are you going to say
[59:07] now remember jesus christ said if you
[59:09] bind it on earth i'll bind it in heaven
[59:11] if you loose it on earth i'll loose it
[59:13] in heaven and if he's god you believe
[59:15] he's god this morning he has to keep his
[59:17] word
[59:19] so brother branham is talking to the
[59:21] catholic priest because a catholic
[59:23] priest
[59:24] is uh
[59:25] they believe the catholics believe that
[59:26] god gave the church the power to forgive
[59:29] sins and that's why
[59:30] you confess to the priest and he will
[59:32] forgive you of your sins i want to tell
[59:34] you this morning i can't do that for you
[59:37] right you could confess your sins to me
[59:38] it wouldn't do you any good as far as
[59:40] other than just let somebody know maybe
[59:42] make you feel better but it wouldn't i
[59:44] couldn't absolve you of those sins i
[59:46] can't do that but if you confess them to
[59:47] god
[59:49] right he's the one who forgives sins
[59:50] there's one mediator between god and man
[59:52] the man christ jesus but now
[59:55] here
[59:56] the the catholics believe because that
[59:58] peter was given the keys that they have
[59:59] the ability to do that brother branham
[1:00:01] dealt with it this way he said
[1:00:03] the catholic said didn't christ give his
[1:00:05] church which which we or his church the
[1:00:07] power to forgive sins on earth he said
[1:00:09] he certainly did
[1:00:11] i said now if you'll forgive them the
[1:00:12] same way that they forgive them or go
[1:00:14] with you i said how'd they forgive them
[1:00:16] did they tell them go do a novena or
[1:00:18] something or the way you do see the key
[1:00:20] it doesn't change
[1:00:22] right if you're going to unbind if
[1:00:24] you're going to open that door
[1:00:26] you can't change the way that you get in
[1:00:29] the way is still by repentance and
[1:00:31] baptism yes
[1:00:33] right and receiving the holy ghost
[1:00:35] that's still the way in right
[1:00:37] yeah that doesn't change
[1:00:40] he said he said no sir peter said repent
[1:00:43] he said there's the key repent every one
[1:00:45] of you and be baptized in the name of
[1:00:46] jesus christ for the remission of your
[1:00:48] sins then you shall receive the gift of
[1:00:50] the holy ghost he said the key went
[1:00:52] click on earth
[1:00:54] and went click
[1:00:56] in heaven
[1:00:59] now we can say anything
[1:01:01] right but if we're using the key
[1:01:04] now what was the key was to unlock the
[1:01:06] mystery
[1:01:08] of matthew
[1:01:09] 28 19 to unlock the mystery of
[1:01:12] uh of baptize them in the name of the
[1:01:14] father son and holy ghost
[1:01:16] right that's a mystery
[1:01:18] right it was placed there to bind
[1:01:21] yes right but he said i've given you
[1:01:23] power to bind
[1:01:25] and to lose
[1:01:27] the worst or any
[1:01:29] so now it was placed there to bind and
[1:01:31] that's why many people today are
[1:01:32] confused by that it was put there for
[1:01:34] the purpose of that but yet peter had
[1:01:36] the key to it and he said repent and be
[1:01:38] baptized every one of you he said why
[1:01:40] would god do that because we must seek
[1:01:42] god by faith there's got to be a
[1:01:44] revelation that comes to you not just
[1:01:47] anybody can come and and and see the
[1:01:49] things that you see but there's got to
[1:01:51] be something down on the inside of you
[1:01:53] we call it a seed of god something
[1:01:55] eternal inside of you that there's
[1:01:56] something there that responds when when
[1:01:58] that key when that door is unlocked you
[1:02:00] say that's it
[1:02:02] so there's got to be a key that you have
[1:02:04] to be able to have revelation to see
[1:02:05] what the word is now
[1:02:08] now again matthew 16 19 he said i will
[1:02:10] give unto thee the keys of the kingdom
[1:02:12] of heaven
[1:02:13] whatever you bind on earth shall be
[1:02:15] bound in heaven whatever you loose on
[1:02:16] earth shall be loosed in heaven
[1:02:19] now he said keys
[1:02:21] and these were given to peter and we
[1:02:23] believe we still have these today
[1:02:26] now we know that god does nothing
[1:02:27] without a man brother adam said peter
[1:02:29] was given the key to the kingdom
[1:02:31] and said whatever you bind on earth i'll
[1:02:33] bind it in heaven what does the key do
[1:02:35] it unlocks something the mystery
[1:02:37] and when jesus said go baptize them in
[1:02:39] the name of the father son and holy go
[1:02:41] sitting there
[1:02:42] he said setting that there to blind the
[1:02:45] unbeliever
[1:02:47] he said well god can't do that why not
[1:02:49] he's god
[1:02:51] god does what he wants
[1:02:54] right but there's a purpose in it
[1:02:56] now there were some mysteries
[1:02:59] that
[1:03:00] were hidden in the scripture
[1:03:02] and i'm not going to go back into all of
[1:03:04] this today because you understand this
[1:03:06] but just to kind of give you an idea
[1:03:08] where i'm going today there are some
[1:03:10] mysteries hidden in the scripture and
[1:03:12] daniel talks about it revelation talks
[1:03:14] about it in revelation 10 7 says in the
[1:03:16] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[1:03:17] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[1:03:19] of god should be finished so we'd say it
[1:03:21] like this that the doors will all be
[1:03:23] unlocked the
[1:03:24] the key will finally unlock the door the
[1:03:27] the church at that time will have the
[1:03:29] keys the seventh angel if we could be
[1:03:31] more particular we'll have the keys to
[1:03:33] unlock the door to the entire mystery of
[1:03:36] god
[1:03:37] now we know that some had different keys
[1:03:39] at different times luther had a key to
[1:03:41] unlock justification wesley had the key
[1:03:44] to unlock sanctification the
[1:03:45] pentecostals had a key to unlock the
[1:03:47] restoration of the gifts
[1:03:49] right they understood that when others
[1:03:51] didn't
[1:03:52] but here comes the seventh angel with
[1:03:54] the key to unlock all the mysteries of
[1:03:56] god right to go
[1:03:59] all the way across to jordan to go into
[1:04:02] where the promises of god are
[1:04:05] the key to do that the power to bind and
[1:04:08] to unbind not just a part of the
[1:04:10] scriptures but all of the scriptures
[1:04:14] you realize where we live this morning
[1:04:16] we don't live under a partial
[1:04:18] realization we don't live under a thing
[1:04:20] where where we have an excuse
[1:04:24] we don't have an excuse anymore
[1:04:27] for how we live and what we do we've
[1:04:29] been given power to become sons and
[1:04:31] daughters of god we've been given
[1:04:33] authority to to take hold of the keys
[1:04:35] and unlock the mysteries of god we've
[1:04:37] been given the revelation that we have
[1:04:39] need of it's all here for us
[1:04:42] we're not looking for someone to go that
[1:04:44] last step into the promised land but a
[1:04:46] prophet of god walked into it unlocked
[1:04:49] it for us
[1:04:51] and we're standing on the shoulders of a
[1:04:53] prophet of god today and we have access
[1:04:55] to healing we have access to salvation
[1:04:57] we have access to the word of god are
[1:04:59] you are you with me today we've got
[1:05:01] access to whatever we have need of so
[1:05:03] that removes all excuses he said brother
[1:05:05] man well i just can't seem to live it i
[1:05:06] just can't seem to be happy i just can't
[1:05:08] seem to i just can't seem to take
[1:05:10] advantage of the promise of joy i just
[1:05:12] can't seem to take advantage of the
[1:05:14] promise of peace i just can't seem to
[1:05:16] take advantage of the promise of healing
[1:05:17] well why is that it's not it's not god's
[1:05:20] fault
[1:05:21] because this is the land of the promises
[1:05:24] this is the land where the promises lay
[1:05:26] you're living in it
[1:05:27] the mystery of god is finished the door
[1:05:30] is unlocked
[1:05:32] before that time those people did not
[1:05:34] know how to be saved men and brethren
[1:05:36] what shall we do but when peter unlocked
[1:05:38] the door come on
[1:05:39] yeah oh my that's what this message did
[1:05:41] to us
[1:05:43] are you hearing me this morning
[1:05:46] oh my
[1:05:51] excuse me i've been a little low on
[1:05:52] breath all week but we're getting there
[1:06:01] now
[1:06:03] the bible says
[1:06:05] so so now we we found the seventh angel
[1:06:07] then has the key to unlock the hidden
[1:06:09] mystery of the entire bible
[1:06:11] the bible says this in first corinthians
[1:06:12] 15 25
[1:06:14] it says he must reign
[1:06:16] christ
[1:06:17] must reign until he has put all enemies
[1:06:19] someone say all enemies
[1:06:22] he must reign
[1:06:24] he must exercise his power
[1:06:27] tilleth put all enemies under his feet
[1:06:31] he said in the last enemy that shall be
[1:06:33] destroyed
[1:06:34] is death
[1:06:36] this is the worst
[1:06:39] now and what i've said so far i just
[1:06:41] want you to remember that as we continue
[1:06:43] going and put on your thinking caps
[1:06:45] because it'll be important as we go
[1:06:47] along
[1:06:48] so he said the last enemy that shall be
[1:06:50] destroyed is death
[1:06:52] behold i show you a mystery
[1:06:56] click
[1:06:58] right they didn't know this behold i
[1:07:01] show you a mystery
[1:07:03] we shall not all sleep
[1:07:05] but we shall all be changed
[1:07:09] in a moment in the twinkling of an eye
[1:07:12] at the last trump for the trumpet shall
[1:07:14] sound and the dead shall be raised
[1:07:16] incorruptible and we shall be
[1:07:19] changed
[1:07:20] for this corruptible must put on
[1:07:22] incorruption this mortal must put on
[1:07:24] immortality
[1:07:25] so when this corruptable shall have put
[1:07:27] on incorruption and this mortal shall
[1:07:29] have put on immortality then shall be
[1:07:31] brought to pass the saying that his
[1:07:32] written death is swallowed up
[1:07:35] in victory
[1:07:38] so now
[1:07:39] now but he watch what he told him he
[1:07:40] said i show you a mystery
[1:07:43] paul had a key to unlock
[1:07:45] that portion of it that could be
[1:07:46] understood in their day
[1:07:48] but there's a portion of that rapture
[1:07:50] mystery that was left for this day
[1:07:53] how many understand that brother branham
[1:07:55] taught us that this mystery of going
[1:07:57] must be revealed by the seventh angel's
[1:07:59] message he said but to the church the
[1:08:02] bride the rapture is a revelation to her
[1:08:05] it's revealed to her
[1:08:08] how many believe you're the bride
[1:08:09] tonight
[1:08:10] this morning you believe you're the
[1:08:12] bride if you're the bride of jesus
[1:08:13] christ then the rapture is a revelation
[1:08:16] to you he said brother ben that's that's
[1:08:17] beyond my understanding he didn't say
[1:08:19] that it was an understanding to you or
[1:08:21] knowledge to you yeah he said it was
[1:08:24] revelation to you
[1:08:26] it's revelation to you you get to walk
[1:08:29] into it
[1:08:30] you've got the key to it you've been
[1:08:32] handed the key
[1:08:34] to the rapture
[1:08:36] oh my
[1:08:37] he said but that's a door that's locked
[1:08:39] and that's where so many people stop
[1:08:40] because they see a door that's locked
[1:08:42] and they say well i can never be a real
[1:08:44] christian because that that's locked to
[1:08:46] me i i can't be like all these other
[1:08:48] people i i just wouldn't it wouldn't be
[1:08:49] right i i can't live like that i can't
[1:08:52] do like that i can't receive my healing
[1:08:54] that's a door that's locked to me you've
[1:08:56] been given the keys
[1:09:00] by the message of the hour
[1:09:03] and what i want to lift up to you this
[1:09:04] morning and try to get you to understand
[1:09:06] is that the keys
[1:09:08] oh god
[1:09:10] it was peter who had the key
[1:09:12] they could stand there and quote matthew
[1:09:13] 28 19 all they wanted to but they had to
[1:09:16] get the key to it
[1:09:17] and it's this message it gives us the
[1:09:19] key to the entire bible
[1:09:22] then what should we be doing we should
[1:09:23] be getting into the message of the hour
[1:09:25] we should be preaching the message of
[1:09:27] the hour we should be reading the
[1:09:29] message of the hour because that's the
[1:09:30] key he gave us the key to the rapture
[1:09:34] the rapture was the door and the and the
[1:09:36] church age walked up to it and said we
[1:09:38] can't go in yeah
[1:09:40] and god said here's the revelation of it
[1:09:42] yes
[1:09:43] right
[1:09:45] he said well that's hard for me to
[1:09:46] understand no it's you just have to
[1:09:48] believe it
[1:09:51] the key to it is in the seventh angel's
[1:09:53] message
[1:09:54] not my message
[1:09:56] why do we do what we do why do we try to
[1:09:58] spread this message around the world
[1:10:00] why do we try to tell people why do we
[1:10:02] witness about it i think some people
[1:10:03] have gotten ashamed of it
[1:10:05] and that's a shame
[1:10:07] this message is christ
[1:10:09] this message is not a cult it's not a
[1:10:11] following it's not a man it's key
[1:10:14] to unlock the rapture
[1:10:17] i mean you want to go
[1:10:19] how many want to go today you're getting
[1:10:21] tired of this world getting tired of the
[1:10:23] things going on getting tired of of all
[1:10:25] the things in politics getting tired of
[1:10:27] the economy get down i want to go how we
[1:10:30] going to go by this message
[1:10:32] that's what gives us the key amen where
[1:10:35] we can walk up to the door confidently
[1:10:37] walk up to the door and say here i am
[1:10:40] i'm ready to go home
[1:10:42] we can dress ourselves in the message of
[1:10:44] the hour
[1:10:46] see that the door has to be unlocked for
[1:10:48] us to go through but the braham said the
[1:10:50] rapture is a revelation to her it's
[1:10:51] revealed to her that the revelation the
[1:10:53] true bride of christ will be waiting for
[1:10:54] that revelation of the rapture he said
[1:10:56] now it is a revelation for the
[1:10:58] revelation is faith
[1:10:59] you cannot have a revelation without it
[1:11:01] being faith
[1:11:02] he said faith is a revelation because
[1:11:04] it's something that's revealed to you
[1:11:06] he said faith is something that's been
[1:11:07] revealed to you like it was to abraham
[1:11:09] that could call anything contrary listen
[1:11:12] to what had been revealed to him
[1:11:14] so it wasn't so
[1:11:17] right so we have a message that's been
[1:11:19] revealed
[1:11:20] we have a message and
[1:11:22] and and faith in this hour call anything
[1:11:25] contrary to the message of the hours
[1:11:27] though it wasn't so right and and i'm
[1:11:29] not telling you to go away say well you
[1:11:31] take things that are outside of the
[1:11:33] bible no the message of the hour is the
[1:11:35] scriptures
[1:11:36] for our day
[1:11:38] you understand that the word it's the
[1:11:40] word made flesh and manifest and and
[1:11:42] opened up to us in our day it won't be
[1:11:45] anything outside of the book it can't be
[1:11:47] it's got to be within it and so but it's
[1:11:49] just the unlocking of it so that we can
[1:11:51] see what's on the inside
[1:11:54] so it's something that's revealed to us
[1:11:55] like abraham so we look at that and we
[1:11:57] say well anything contrary to that the
[1:12:00] world says you've got to do this you've
[1:12:01] got to do that the world says this is
[1:12:03] how you should raise your families the
[1:12:04] world said this is how you should treat
[1:12:06] your wife the world said this is how you
[1:12:08] should treat your husband but the
[1:12:09] message of the hour says yes
[1:12:12] are you with me now it matters what the
[1:12:15] message says
[1:12:16] because the message of the hour is the
[1:12:18] unlocking of the key
[1:12:22] hey man
[1:12:25] now look
[1:12:26] and it's not just big mysteries our
[1:12:28] everyday life
[1:12:30] but so now when we see something it's
[1:12:32] contrary to it so
[1:12:34] your body tells you he says
[1:12:36] you're going to die and you're going to
[1:12:37] stay dead
[1:12:39] and and you're never going there's never
[1:12:41] going there's no hope for you there's no
[1:12:43] resurrection
[1:12:45] maybe your spirit tells you oh you've
[1:12:46] done too many bad things you've you've
[1:12:49] entered but what did the message tell
[1:12:50] you yeah
[1:12:52] what did the message tell
[1:12:54] the message said
[1:12:57] you're going to be raised with him
[1:12:58] you've already been quickened with him
[1:13:01] the message said that your sins were put
[1:13:03] in the sea of forgetfulness
[1:13:06] right that's what the message of the
[1:13:08] hour said that's what the word this word
[1:13:11] for our day it's literally just that
[1:13:13] part of this word that portion for our
[1:13:15] day the word of the hour is just god
[1:13:18] coming down and through a prophet
[1:13:20] manifesting and showing and revealing to
[1:13:22] us the things that we would need for our
[1:13:24] time
[1:13:25] there were certain things that were
[1:13:26] given for breakfast certain things that
[1:13:28] were given for dinner or lunch and
[1:13:30] certain things that were given for
[1:13:31] supper what was it this is the evening
[1:13:33] time
[1:13:34] this was time for a full seven course
[1:13:36] meal so at this time the holy ghost
[1:13:39] dispensed through a prophet the things
[1:13:41] that we would need to eat
[1:13:44] amen to be able to go home
[1:13:47] now brother brown said the church he
[1:13:48] said is built upon a revelation the
[1:13:50] whole entire body
[1:13:52] again brother branham says this he said
[1:13:54] i believe that through these seven
[1:13:55] thunders
[1:13:56] through those seven thunders will be
[1:13:57] revealed in the last days in order to
[1:13:59] get the bride together for rapturing
[1:14:01] faith
[1:14:02] he said because what we got right now we
[1:14:04] wouldn't be able to do it
[1:14:05] he said there is something we've got to
[1:14:07] step further he said we can't have
[1:14:09] enough faith for divine healing hardly
[1:14:10] we've got to have enough faith to be
[1:14:11] changed in a moment and be swept out of
[1:14:13] this earth
[1:14:15] you realize the challenge of this hour
[1:14:17] is higher than the challenge of the
[1:14:18] pentecostal age
[1:14:20] because the challenge of the pentecostal
[1:14:22] age was just to reproduce the gifts
[1:14:23] again in the church
[1:14:24] but this is to do that and more
[1:14:28] this is to go beyond that and to go all
[1:14:29] the way back to eden again
[1:14:31] brother branham calls it another
[1:14:33] ephesians
[1:14:34] a second ephesians
[1:14:36] we're going to get to it in just a
[1:14:37] moment because we're going to come full
[1:14:39] circle back to the message paradox
[1:14:40] because brother branham talks about
[1:14:41] joshua standing there and saying son
[1:14:44] stand still
[1:14:46] and that's what we're coming back to is
[1:14:47] another ephesians
[1:14:49] he said we've got to step farther we've
[1:14:50] got to have faith to be changed in a
[1:14:51] moment it's a higher calling than just
[1:14:53] having faith for a headache but it's to
[1:14:56] be changed in a moment and twinkling of
[1:14:57] an eye but but i wanted to kind of talk
[1:15:00] to you and this is what was inspired to
[1:15:01] me this week is you know
[1:15:03] if it's the worst if the worst if you
[1:15:05] can believe for the worst
[1:15:07] and i know some of you have real faith
[1:15:09] that you're going to go in a rapture
[1:15:11] yeah
[1:15:13] well maybe more less than i thought but
[1:15:16] some of you have real faith
[1:15:20] i'm going to make it if there's going to
[1:15:21] be one brother danny it's going to be me
[1:15:24] real faith
[1:15:26] but then you turn around you get a
[1:15:28] headache
[1:15:30] there's not enough money in the bank or
[1:15:31] you have trouble at work that's right
[1:15:33] so well
[1:15:35] i guess i got to figure this out on my
[1:15:36] own you believe god's gonna change your
[1:15:40] body yes sir that's right
[1:15:43] that's a big deal
[1:15:46] right he's gonna turn me back that's a
[1:15:48] paradox i can't explain that that's the
[1:15:51] worst
[1:15:53] he's going to unbind the greatest
[1:15:55] mystery he's going to unbind the mystery
[1:15:57] of a new body he's going to give me the
[1:15:58] revelation of a rapture he's given that
[1:16:00] to me i believe it by faith i believe it
[1:16:02] then why can't i believe him on monday
[1:16:04] why can't i believe him on tuesday why
[1:16:06] can't i believe him when i'm sick why
[1:16:08] can't i believe him when i come to
[1:16:09] church are you with me why can't i
[1:16:11] believe him when i'm
[1:16:13] on the job why can't i believe him for
[1:16:14] my children
[1:16:16] right he's bound the worst snake that
[1:16:18] there was and if the mamba was bound
[1:16:20] every little copperhead that comes up
[1:16:22] against you you've got a right to bind
[1:16:24] that
[1:16:25] every little black sect that comes by
[1:16:27] your way you've got a right if the worst
[1:16:28] has been bound you've got a right to
[1:16:30] bind any yeah
[1:16:32] right are you with me this morning
[1:16:35] amen
[1:16:37] so these seven seals now he said these
[1:16:38] thunders have to come for rapturing
[1:16:40] faith but then he says this later he
[1:16:42] said it's all revealed in there
[1:16:44] amen and the seven seals opened up the
[1:16:47] revelation of what that was
[1:16:49] that's what it was he said see it's
[1:16:51] still in the word you can't get out of
[1:16:53] the word it won't leave the word
[1:16:55] god's spirit will never leave the word
[1:16:57] it'll stay right with the word blinding
[1:16:59] some and open the eyes of others
[1:17:01] what are the power to bind and unbind
[1:17:03] now watch the mysteries have been
[1:17:05] revealed
[1:17:06] how many believe that this morning
[1:17:09] so the mystery is the lock or the door
[1:17:12] the revelation is the key
[1:17:14] and we have the revelation
[1:17:16] listen if this message
[1:17:19] has delivered us from spiritual death
[1:17:21] yes
[1:17:22] we underestimate the power of that
[1:17:26] you think about it think about what you
[1:17:27] were
[1:17:28] think about what you could be today
[1:17:31] but jeremy could think about that some
[1:17:32] of the rest of you i think most of us
[1:17:34] could look at that and say i can look
[1:17:36] and see where i could be i can look at
[1:17:37] my cousins
[1:17:38] i can look at my some of my family
[1:17:40] members and think what what i could be
[1:17:43] and this message gave me a key
[1:17:46] all right
[1:17:47] it unlocked something the new birth by
[1:17:49] the by the process of the new birth it
[1:17:51] wasn't just the letter of the message
[1:17:52] but the spirit of it
[1:17:54] the new birth come and when it did it
[1:17:57] unlocked to me a key and now i can look
[1:17:59] at and say i'm not what i could have
[1:18:01] been
[1:18:02] i've been saved from spiritual death
[1:18:05] so it's just like in in egypt when uh
[1:18:08] the passover was going uh when the when
[1:18:10] the death angel was going everywhere and
[1:18:12] they were standing there under the token
[1:18:14] under the blood and they could look out
[1:18:15] and see others who were dying other
[1:18:17] families that were losing their
[1:18:18] firstborn and the father of the house
[1:18:20] could stand there like i'm standing
[1:18:22] today and say it hasn't touched my house
[1:18:25] how many could say amen to that today it
[1:18:27] hasn't touched my house why is spiritual
[1:18:30] death not touched my house because i
[1:18:32] have the key
[1:18:34] they had the key in that hour was that
[1:18:36] on the doorpost
[1:18:37] i have the key to the message of the
[1:18:39] hour told me you must have the token on
[1:18:41] display
[1:18:43] right and so that's the key to
[1:18:45] saving us from spiritual death
[1:18:48] but if this message has delivered us
[1:18:50] from spiritual death and will deliver us
[1:18:53] from natural death if it binds the worst
[1:18:55] if the mamba has been bound if the
[1:18:58] promised land is all around us what
[1:19:00] about these little things
[1:19:04] you say well if i could just figure them
[1:19:06] out
[1:19:07] just bind them
[1:19:09] you have the power
[1:19:11] how do i do that by the word
[1:19:14] just just feed on the word now look
[1:19:16] the voice told brother branham you must
[1:19:18] be more sincere
[1:19:21] i want us to go to joshua chapter one
[1:19:29] joshua chapter one and verse one
[1:19:32] it says now after the death of moses the
[1:19:34] servant of the lord it came to pass that
[1:19:35] the lord speaking to joshua the son of
[1:19:36] none
[1:19:38] moses minister is saying moses my
[1:19:39] servant is dead
[1:19:41] now therefore our eyes go over this
[1:19:43] jordan thou and all this people
[1:19:45] to the land which i do give to them
[1:19:48] even to the children of israel
[1:19:51] every place that the soul of your foot
[1:19:53] shall tread upon
[1:19:54] that have i given unto you
[1:19:56] as i said unto moses he said you need to
[1:19:58] cross on in
[1:20:00] this is the land where the promises are
[1:20:03] he said i've given it unto you from the
[1:20:04] wilderness then this lebanon
[1:20:07] even unto the great river the river
[1:20:08] euphrates all the land of the hittites
[1:20:11] and to the great sea toward the going
[1:20:12] down of the sun shall be your coast
[1:20:14] there shall not any man be able to stand
[1:20:16] before thee all the days of thy life
[1:20:20] as i was with moses so i will be with
[1:20:22] thee
[1:20:23] i will not fail thee nor forsake thee
[1:20:26] be strong and of good courage
[1:20:29] for unto this people shalt thou divide
[1:20:31] for an inheritance the land which i
[1:20:33] swear unto their fathers to give them
[1:20:35] only be thou strong and very courageous
[1:20:37] what's he doing
[1:20:39] he's speaking to him now he shows him
[1:20:41] this is what you're going to do this is
[1:20:42] what you're supposed to do go into the
[1:20:44] land you're supposed to go all the way
[1:20:46] in be strong be courageous
[1:20:48] now think about it like this be sincere
[1:20:53] be sincere be strong be courageous be
[1:20:56] sincere
[1:20:57] that's what sincerity is is being strong
[1:21:00] and courageous about the word
[1:21:02] i hope you're hearing me now it's not
[1:21:04] just being sincere and just in general
[1:21:06] because you can be sincerely wrong
[1:21:09] but it's being strong and courageous
[1:21:11] about the word that's true sincerity so
[1:21:13] he's reminding joshua you need to be
[1:21:15] more sincere you need to be very strong
[1:21:17] you're strong joshua be stronger your
[1:21:20] courageous joshua be more courageous
[1:21:23] because it's going to take that to enter
[1:21:24] into this land

[1:21:30] i hope you hear me this morning this
[1:21:32] land ain't for sissies
[1:21:34] this land ain't for halfway christians
[1:21:36] right
[1:21:37] this land ain't for people who don't
[1:21:39] know whether they're in or out
[1:21:41] this land is difficult this land is o
[1:21:43] landed for warriors
[1:21:45] this land is a land with giants in it
[1:21:49] this land is a land of grapes but it's
[1:21:50] also a land of giants this land is a
[1:21:53] land this is a land of beautiful fields
[1:21:55] that you can plant but it's also a land
[1:21:57] of walled cities
[1:21:59] that have to be shaken down
[1:22:02] if you're gonna walk into it it's a good
[1:22:03] land it's the land where the promises
[1:22:05] are but he said you need to be more
[1:22:06] sincere to enter into this
[1:22:08] land you need to have you need to get
[1:22:11] really down to business with god and if
[1:22:13] i could make a call this morning that
[1:22:15] would be my call to myself and to each
[1:22:17] one of us individually you need to be
[1:22:19] more sincere if you're going into this
[1:22:21] land you need to start caring about the
[1:22:23] house of god you need to start caring
[1:22:24] about the things of god you need to
[1:22:26] start really digging down into the word
[1:22:28] of god listen to the message of the hour
[1:22:30] be more sincere
[1:22:33] be strong and courageous
[1:22:36] don't be afraid
[1:22:38] because this is a good land
[1:22:41] listen what he says
[1:22:43] he said be strong and very courageous
[1:22:44] that thou mayest observe to do
[1:22:47] be sincere about it
[1:22:49] according to all the law which moses my
[1:22:51] servant commanded thee turn not from it
[1:22:52] to the right hand or to the left that
[1:22:54] thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou
[1:22:56] goest
[1:22:57] this book of the law shall not depart
[1:22:59] out of thy mouth
[1:23:01] but thou shalt meditate therein day and
[1:23:02] night you want to know how to take the
[1:23:04] land
[1:23:05] how many are interested in taking the
[1:23:06] land this morning
[1:23:08] i'm interested in taking the land
[1:23:10] i've got an interest in going all the
[1:23:12] way in because that's where the body
[1:23:14] change is
[1:23:15] on the other side of that river that's
[1:23:17] where the body change is that's where
[1:23:18] the that's where the promises are i have
[1:23:21] an interest in taking the land and i
[1:23:22] believe we're in the land today but we
[1:23:24] still have to take it for ourselves
[1:23:26] whatever has been allotted to us we
[1:23:28] still have to walk on it we still have
[1:23:30] to walk on it how we gonna walk on it
[1:23:32] this book of the law shall not depart
[1:23:33] out of thy mouth thou shalt meditate
[1:23:36] there in day and night that thou mayest
[1:23:38] observe to do according to all that has
[1:23:39] written therein for then thou shalt make
[1:23:41] thy way prosperous then thou shalt have
[1:23:43] good success
[1:23:44] have not i commanded thee
[1:23:46] be strong and of a good courage
[1:23:49] be not afraid
[1:23:50] neither be thou dismayed for the lord
[1:23:52] thy god is with thee
[1:23:54] wheresoever thou goest
[1:23:57] joshua
[1:23:58] be more sincere
[1:24:01] now the angel told by the brandon
[1:24:03] brother brandon be more sincere
[1:24:05] you've got to be more sincere than what
[1:24:06] you are it's hard for me to even fathom
[1:24:08] almost
[1:24:10] you've had these great healing meetings
[1:24:11] god's spoken in your life you you fast
[1:24:14] and you pray and you touch the heart of
[1:24:15] god
[1:24:16] be more sincere
[1:24:18] because you're not just called
[1:24:20] to provide healing for the body you
[1:24:22] realize that was just a sign
[1:24:24] to attract the people
[1:24:26] that would just debate on the hook
[1:24:28] but we're not stopping with healing for
[1:24:30] the body
[1:24:31] we're going home
[1:24:34] so now he says joshua
[1:24:37] be more sincere
[1:24:39] now joshua as he gets into the land he
[1:24:41] gets into the battle of his life it
[1:24:42] wasn't easy
[1:24:44] but he said i'll be with you
[1:24:48] he said every everywhere you go i'll be
[1:24:50] with you
[1:24:52] and the enemy began to run
[1:24:54] and joshua's got him on the move
[1:24:57] in joshua chapter 10 we find that when
[1:24:59] he gets him on the move
[1:25:01] that he's almost out of time in the day
[1:25:05] so we need some more time
[1:25:07] oh god
[1:25:09] he needs some more time
[1:25:11] in the day
[1:25:13] to be able to route the enemy
[1:25:16] to be able to put him to complete flight
[1:25:19] so what does he what does he do
[1:25:21] now god's already told him i'll be with
[1:25:23] you you need to be more sincere be
[1:25:24] strong be courageous
[1:25:26] joshua 10 12 then spake joshua to the
[1:25:28] lord in the day when the lord delivered
[1:25:30] up the amorites before the children of
[1:25:32] israel
[1:25:33] and he said in the sight of israel
[1:25:35] sons stand thou still upon gibeon
[1:25:38] and thou moon in the valley of agilent
[1:25:40] now brother branham illustrated that and
[1:25:42] he said you know same earth stands still
[1:25:44] although that would be more logical
[1:25:46] but he didn't say earth standstill he
[1:25:47] said sun stands still because it's a
[1:25:49] paradox
[1:25:50] what that means is you can't explain it
[1:25:55] right
[1:25:56] we want to be able to explain everything
[1:25:57] but a paradox literally means you can't
[1:25:59] explain it
[1:26:01] yet it's true
[1:26:03] it's a paradox that you're saved today
[1:26:04] you can't explain it but it's true
[1:26:08] are you with me this morning
[1:26:10] i'll try not to hold you too long
[1:26:13] so the sun stood still
[1:26:15] he said sun stand still now moon in the
[1:26:17] valley of agile and the sun stood still
[1:26:20] the moon stayed until the people had
[1:26:21] avenged themselves upon their enemies he
[1:26:23] said is this not written in the book of
[1:26:25] jasper so the sun stood still in the
[1:26:27] midst of heaven and hastened not to go
[1:26:28] down about a whole day
[1:26:30] there was no day like that before it or
[1:26:32] after it that the lord hearkened unto
[1:26:34] the voice of a man for the lord fought
[1:26:36] for israel
[1:26:38] but he said he would be there with them
[1:26:40] he said joshua i'm going to go with you
[1:26:43] why because he was living now in the
[1:26:45] land of promises
[1:26:47] he said joshua if you'll be sincere amen
[1:26:51] if you believe me if you'll walk into it
[1:26:53] if you'll go in if you'll fight
[1:26:56] he said you you'll be able to live in
[1:26:58] the land of promises and in the land of
[1:27:00] promises he said son stand still now
[1:27:03] brother branham said the same thing was
[1:27:04] in mark 11 23
[1:27:06] if you say to this mountain be moved
[1:27:09] and don't doubt in your heart but
[1:27:10] believe what you said will come to pass
[1:27:12] you can have what you said
[1:27:14] he said but you can't stand there and
[1:27:16] fumble in your mind and say it you've
[1:27:18] got to be inspired to say it
[1:27:21] and he goes on to the squirrels and
[1:27:23] hattie wright and begins to talk about
[1:27:25] that because that was brother branham's
[1:27:27] moment when he said you must be more
[1:27:28] sincere then brother branham comes to a
[1:27:30] time where he spoke those things into
[1:27:32] existence and and then had he write
[1:27:34] actually when he spoke hattie wright
[1:27:36] spoke and her own boys were saved
[1:27:39] and so that was the spoken word being
[1:27:40] manifested and that was the fulfillment
[1:27:43] of that now he's not two-thirds of the
[1:27:44] way in the land he's in the land
[1:27:47] that's where the promises are the spoken
[1:27:49] word
[1:27:50] are you with me this morning
[1:27:52] he said now
[1:27:54] he said that's mark 11 23 verily i say
[1:27:56] unto you
[1:27:57] whosoever shall say whosoever
[1:28:00] whosoever that means me right
[1:28:03] whosoever shall say unto this mountain
[1:28:06] be thou removed and be thou cast into
[1:28:09] the sea and shall not doubt in his heart
[1:28:11] but shall believe that those things
[1:28:13] which he saith shall come to pass he
[1:28:15] saith
[1:28:17] he shall have
[1:28:19] whatsoever he saith
[1:28:21] brother brandon said notice when you
[1:28:23] have a need
[1:28:24] perhaps like joshua he had a need he
[1:28:27] never thought of the circumstances
[1:28:29] oh and that's what gets us in trouble so
[1:28:31] many times we begin to think about the
[1:28:33] circumstances we begin to dwell on the
[1:28:35] circumstances we begin to think about
[1:28:37] what why it can't be
[1:28:40] joshua didn't stand there and measure
[1:28:41] the distance from the sun to the earth
[1:28:43] he didn't stand there and think about
[1:28:44] well it's impossible for the sun to
[1:28:46] stand still he didn't think about it he
[1:28:47] was just inspired to say it
[1:28:50] he didn't sit there and and argue about
[1:28:52] it he didn't sit there and fuss about it
[1:28:54] but he just said son stand still because
[1:28:56] that's what he needed
[1:28:59] oh god and when brother branham needed
[1:29:01] squirrels which seems like an
[1:29:02] insignificant thing
[1:29:04] he just said speak and it'll be there
[1:29:07] there it
[1:29:08] was but the brother said when you have a
[1:29:11] need
[1:29:12] he had a need he never thought of the
[1:29:13] circumstances he spoke it and it was god
[1:29:16] he said do you believe the son stood
[1:29:17] still so do i
[1:29:19] how did it do it don't try to figure it
[1:29:20] out but it did it joshua did it and
[1:29:23] raised his hands in that crucial moment
[1:29:25] oh god i hope you realize today in your
[1:29:27] crucial moment when you get to the time
[1:29:29] when you really need it he said in that
[1:29:31] crucial moment he had access to god yes
[1:29:34] that's right but you got to be living in
[1:29:36] the land yes
[1:29:38] you don't live in the land when you get
[1:29:40] in the crucial moment oh let me cross
[1:29:42] over into jordan no you're already in
[1:29:44] the land
[1:29:45] right you're fighting you're there
[1:29:47] you've received the baptism of the holy
[1:29:49] ghost you're standing in the land you're
[1:29:51] believing the word you're you're feeding
[1:29:53] on the message of the hour
[1:29:55] you're assembling yourselves with
[1:29:56] believers
[1:29:58] you're in the land
[1:30:00] see when you don't do those things
[1:30:01] you're keeping yourself out you're
[1:30:02] you're standing on the other side of the
[1:30:03] jordan saying well well i never see my
[1:30:05] prayers answered no you need to be in
[1:30:07] the land
[1:30:08] and if you're in the land then don't
[1:30:10] look at the circumstances
[1:30:12] but look at the promise
[1:30:14] when you have a need
[1:30:16] in that crucial moment oh i wonder this
[1:30:18] morning maybe someone here is going
[1:30:20] through a time a crucial moment in their
[1:30:22] life he said in that crucial moment he
[1:30:25] had access to god
[1:30:27] and that's what happened it was timely
[1:30:29] he said the spirit oh my see you don't
[1:30:32] just see what you need in your life but
[1:30:34] god sees what you need that's what jesus
[1:30:36] told the disciples he said don't take
[1:30:38] any anxious thought about tomorrow he
[1:30:39] said doesn't god see what you need if
[1:30:41] god knows what the sparrow needs to live
[1:30:43] doesn't he see what you need
[1:30:45] what's bothering you this morning what's
[1:30:47] keeping you out of the economy of god
[1:30:49] you're sitting there and your mind's
[1:30:50] running about money or your mind's
[1:30:52] running about about your family about
[1:30:54] something else don't you realize this
[1:30:56] morning that that keep what's keeping
[1:30:58] out if you just step into the land in
[1:31:00] that crucial moment he would meet you
[1:31:02] there
[1:31:03] amen
[1:31:05] the spirit of the living god has seen
[1:31:07] the need of it
[1:31:09] and pushed upon joshua to say it
[1:31:12] the same god seeing the need of abraham
[1:31:14] the same god seeing the need of
[1:31:16] confirming
[1:31:17] he said this scripture to me this mark
[1:31:19] 11 23 confirmed it with the squirrels
[1:31:21] with hattie wright with his own wife the
[1:31:23] the different times i believe it was
[1:31:24] five times of the spoken word
[1:31:27] he said the same god seen the need of
[1:31:29] confirming this scripture to me that
[1:31:31] that scripture is true too
[1:31:33] he said the same god seeing the need of
[1:31:35] those two predestinated boys you have
[1:31:37] children out of the ark of safety god
[1:31:39] sees that need yes
[1:31:41] do you believe he sees it today
[1:31:43] then in the crucial moment you have
[1:31:45] access to god speaking
[1:31:47] amen and it'll be
[1:31:50] we either believe that or we don't
[1:31:54] oh my
[1:31:55] listen have you made the sun stand still
[1:31:58] oh god yeah
[1:32:02] if he delivered you from spiritual death
[1:32:04] you know god always gives you what you
[1:32:06] have neither if i found that if i would
[1:32:07] preach
[1:32:08] even if i was sick if i'd preach if i
[1:32:11] just do what i was supposed to do god
[1:32:13] would make a way
[1:32:15] somehow in the crucial moments
[1:32:18] they didn't know what to do that jesus
[1:32:20] said roll the stone away if they'd have
[1:32:22] walked away and said oh it just can't be
[1:32:23] done if mary and martha had walked away
[1:32:26] lazarus would have never raised
[1:32:28] but he said roll the stone away they
[1:32:30] couldn't raise lazarus but they could
[1:32:31] roll a stone
[1:32:33] are you hearing me they could roll a
[1:32:35] stone it might have been hard work but
[1:32:36] they had to do it somebody's got to roll
[1:32:38] the stone away somebody's got to preach

[1:35:54] morning you're going to meet us once
[1:35:56] again i believe lord that you're the
[1:35:58] same yesterday today and forever i pray

[1:36:02] hearts of each and every believer
[1:36:05] every person here in the divine presence
[1:36:07] this morning lord i know sometimes when

[1:36:11] begin to wonder well maybe i'm in the
[1:36:13] in the wrong place i i'm not in the will
[1:36:15] of god help them lord understand
[1:36:18] that the place they need to be in is in

[1:36:24] that's not a preacher it's not a certain
[1:36:26] church not this church or any other
[1:36:28] but it's your word lord
[1:36:30] i pray that we would be in that word
[1:36:33] or that we would be feeding on it every
[1:36:34] day
[1:36:35] lord and we would know that that word
[1:36:37] can give us strength like when israel
[1:36:40] was in egypt and they fed on the lamb
[1:36:42] and their lamb was roasted with fire and
[1:36:44] they fed on it when they fed on that
[1:36:46] lamb it gave them strength for their
[1:36:47] journey
[1:36:48] he told them he said eat all of it don't
[1:36:50] just eat part of it eat every bit of it
[1:36:52] because you're going to need the
[1:36:54] strength for the journey i pray that we
[1:36:56] would get that revelation today that the
[1:36:58] door would be unlocked to the message of
[1:37:00] the hour we'd begin to feed on the good
[1:37:02] things of god and we'd be ready when
[1:37:04] that moment comes to be changed in a
[1:37:06] moment in a twinkling of an eye but
[1:37:08] until that time all these other serpents
[1:37:10] or all these other
[1:37:11] other little snakes that have come up
[1:37:13] around us i pray you'd help us to
[1:37:15] understand we have power to bind each
[1:37:17] and every one we thank you for that
