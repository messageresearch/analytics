[9:28] Lord, we're just so thankful that as
[9:31] your word says, if two or three are
[9:32] gathered together in your name that
[9:34] you'll be here in our midst, Lord. And
[9:36] we realize in the scriptures that every
[9:37] time that you showed up somewhere, Lord,
[9:39] it was for a purpose. Lord, if it was to
[9:41] heal the sick or to raise the dead or to
[9:44] deliver those that are bound, Lord,
[9:45] there was a purpose behind you showing
[9:47] up. So, Lord, we just invite you into
[9:48] this service, Lord, we just ask that you
[9:50] would be with those needs, Lord. that
[9:51] you would just uh break the chains of
[9:54] those people that are bound, Lord. Heal
[9:55] the sick, deliver those of us that need
[9:57] deliverance, Lord. Whatever the need is
[9:59] amongst the people tonight, Lord, we
[10:00] just ask that you would take those needs
[10:02] into consideration tonight, Lord, and
[10:04] that you would just give them a special
[10:05] touch from you, Lord. Be with the
[10:07] offering, we ask in Jesus name.

[18:41] Do you feel like the storm just won't
[18:45] break?

[18:59] Well, tell me a time he's not been
[19:04] faithful. Tell me a morning his mercies

[19:28] when he couldn't roll back the tide.

[20:00] his promises. If you doubt it, just read
[20:03] through his word.
[20:08] Tell me a time
[20:11] he's not been faithful. Or tell me a
[20:15] morning his mercies were new. Tell me a
[20:20] moment
[20:22] he wasn't able to carry you through.
[20:30] Tell me a day he was less than almighty
[20:36] when he couldn't roll back the tide.
[20:40] Child, when you look back, you're going
[20:44] to find there was never a time.
[20:51] Oh, he can work miracles, do the

[20:59] then go on and try.

[22:28] Lord tonight.
[22:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:30] &gt;&gt; We sure enjoyed the service this
[22:31] morning. My goodness, how it all tied
[22:34] together. I told him, I said, "You just
[22:35] about lost me." I said, "Then you tied
[22:37] it all together there at the end." And
[22:38] it just made sense. And so I was uh I
[22:41] enjoyed it this morning, man. The Lord's
[22:42] been good to us. Oh Lord, we are the
[22:46] ones called by your name.
[22:53] We humble ourselves now
[22:57] as we pray.
[23:02] renouncing every sin and wicked way.
[23:11] We lift our voice, seek your face and
[23:15] say,
[23:18] "Oh Lord, send rain."
[23:22] Oh, you pour out your spirit.
[23:27] And I fall
[23:31] all
[23:32] on me.
[23:35] Oh,
[23:40] won't you pour out
[23:45] the fire
[23:47] [Music]
[23:50] on me?
[23:52] [Music]
[23:54] Oh Lord, we are the ones called by your
[23:59] name.
[24:00] [Music]
[24:03] And we humble ourselves down as we pray,
[24:12] reounce together sin and away.
[24:20] Oh, we lift our voice. We see your face
[24:24] and say,
[24:27] "Oh Lord,
[24:32] what you Yeah.
[24:39] [Music]
[24:44] Oh,
[24:49] you pour out your sp.
[24:58] Sing it one more time with all your
[25:00] hearts now. Oh
[25:12] my go
[25:24] pour out the spirit.
[25:28] Let the fire fall. Heal us one and all.
[25:33] All fresh on me.
[25:38] Give the Lord a big hand clap of praise.
[25:40] Amen. Aren't you ready for the fire to
[25:41] fall on us tonight? Amen. I know we sang
[25:44] this at the very end of the service this
[25:46] morning, but it comes to me just now. It
[25:47] won't be long. Amen. It won't be long
[25:50] till we be leaving here. And we just
[25:53] want to sing this with all of our hearts
[25:54] as our pastor comes this evening to
[25:55] speak to us. And Amen. And are you under
[25:58] expectation tonight?
[26:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe if you're expecting
[26:01] something from the Lord, you get what
[26:03] you expect.
[26:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:04] &gt;&gt; If you expect it to be real long, it
[26:05] might be real long.
[26:08] But if you expect it, you know, to go by
[26:09] quick and you expect to enjoy it, it's
[26:11] going to be an enjoyable long time.
[26:14] And so I'll say this, you get what you
[26:17] expect. And I think if the if the church
[26:19] would come under expectation, there's
[26:20] just no telling what God might do
[26:22] tonight. And I know sometimes we get a
[26:24] little tired. If you get tired, just
[26:25] stand up and back the preacher. and you
[26:27] feel better. You feel better. So, just
[26:29] back the word with all you got. And I do
[26:32] believe with all my heart that God can
[26:33] move right in here just like a Saturday
[26:35] night meeting service, just like any
[26:37] other service because there's no limit
[26:39] to my God and what God can do. Amen.
[26:42] We've seen so many testimonies coming in
[26:44] and I'll say this, all the testimonies
[26:46] that have come in. Amen. That wasn't
[26:47] because a certain man was here, but it
[26:49] was the same God that's here every
[26:50] service.
[26:52] &gt;&gt; And you say, "How do we know he's here?"
[26:54] because he promised to be with his
[26:55] believers when they gather together. So
[26:57] under expectation, let's invite our
[26:59] pastor and let's sing this with all of
[27:00] our hearts. So it won't be long.
[27:07] It won't be long
[27:10] and then we'll be leaving
[27:14] here.
[27:18] Oh, it won't be long.
[27:24] Oh, and we'll be going
[27:28] home.
[27:29] [Music]
[27:32] Oh, so count the years as much
[27:41] and count the months as
[27:46] [Music]
[27:49] and count the weeks as days.

[28:00] home. It won't be long again.
[28:04] Oh, it won't be long. You believe it to
[28:09] sing
[28:12] and it will be.

[29:46] mercy and your grace. Lord, I pray that

[29:55] would be acceptable in your sight. Lord,

[30:02] would meet that need tonight as we know
[30:03] only you can. I pray that you'd move me
[30:06] out of the way. Speak, Lord, that you
[30:09] know you put this on my heart. Lord, it
[30:11] must be for some purpose. I pray that
[30:13] that purpose would be fulfilled. Lord,
[30:15] move me out of the way so you can speak
[30:17] directly to your people tonight. We pray
[30:20] in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. God bless
[30:24] you. Turn with me to 1 Chronicles

[30:41] go back to this morning's sermon maybe
[30:43] if you weren't here or something and
[30:45] kind of give you a better idea what
[30:46] we're talking about this evening. We're
[30:47] talking about building the temple,
[30:49] David's preparation for building the
[30:51] temple. 1 Chronicles 22:5, David said,
[30:55] Solomon, my son, is young and tender.
[30:58] And the house that is to be builded for
[31:00] the Lord must be exceeding magnical
[31:04] fame and glory throughout all countries.
[31:08] So he's weighing these two things. He
[31:10] said Solomon's got to build the temple.
[31:13] Solomon is young and tender and the
[31:16] house has to be exceeding of exceeding
[31:20] magnificance
[31:21] magnificence
[31:23] of fame and glory through all countries.
[31:26] He said, I will therefore now make
[31:30] preparation for it. So David prepared
[31:34] abundantly
[31:35] before his death. Pray the Lord would
[31:37] add his blessing to the word. You may be
[31:39] seated this evening.
[31:43] As we talked this morning about David
[31:46] uh preparing, he he made the nails. He
[31:50] made the He he he he made the uh doors,
[31:53] the hinges on the doors. He wrote the
[31:55] songs that would be sung, though he
[31:58] would never step foot into the temple
[32:01] itself. He wrote it. He did that for
[32:03] another generation. And he did that not
[32:06] for his own good but for the benefit of
[32:08] Solomon because Solomon was being a type
[32:10] of Christ was the one that that would
[32:13] enter in. Solomon would uh would would
[32:16] build the temple and Christ was the
[32:18] temple of God. And so we find David
[32:22] preparing for that for that for that
[32:24] coming of Solomon just like John the
[32:26] Baptist prepared uh for Jesus made a way
[32:30] for Jesus just like the message of the
[32:31] hour. uh brother Brandham came to us. He
[32:35] brought a message to us to make a way
[32:37] for Christ the word himself to be
[32:40] unveiled to us. And so we believe that
[32:42] that's happened in our day. Now in his
[32:45] preparation for building the temple,
[32:48] David recognized that Solomon had been
[32:50] appointed. He had been anointed for the
[32:53] job. He was he was supposed to do that.
[32:56] And yet he was young and tender and and
[32:59] it was not appropriate to put Solomon
[33:02] into a position that he wasn't yet ready
[33:04] for. And yet the temple could not be
[33:07] built until Solomon was uh ready to do
[33:10] it until David was gone. So what did
[33:13] David do? He didn't try to push Solomon
[33:15] beyond his years. What he did was he he
[33:18] said, "I'm going to do I'm going to
[33:20] prepare I'm going to prepare the
[33:21] building and I'm going to prepare
[33:23] Solomon. I'm going to build something.
[33:26] He wasn't just building a building, but
[33:28] he was building a person to build a
[33:31] building. He was gathering materials to
[33:33] build Solomon to build the temple. So,
[33:37] it was perhaps maybe the foundation of
[33:39] youth ministry as we know it today was
[33:42] actually was Solomon or David preparing
[33:45] Solomon for this job. Now, the word
[33:48] tender is used in the sense of unspoiled
[33:51] by experience.
[33:53] In other words, not callous. We heard
[33:55] about that the other day. Not callous,
[33:56] not not uh uh not complexed up, not not
[34:01] bitter, not not upset by what's went on
[34:04] in their life, but somebody who was
[34:06] tender, who can still be reached. And
[34:08] and so it it's it's unspoiled by
[34:11] experience. and and perhaps Solomon, he
[34:14] he knew Solomon being the age that he
[34:16] was, he didn't expect Solomon to go out
[34:18] and start buying building the temple and
[34:20] buying nails and putting together a
[34:22] building. That's not what David did at
[34:24] all. So, he wasn't making Solomon do it.
[34:27] He was doing it himself and preparing
[34:30] Solomon for a future work.
[34:32] &gt;&gt; Are you with me so far?
[34:34] &gt;&gt; So, that's what we do as parents and as
[34:36] as pastors, as as youth leaders. We're
[34:39] preparing kids. We're preparing young
[34:41] people. We're not preparing them just to
[34:43] be kids, not to just stay kids. We're
[34:46] preparing them to take our jobs,
[34:49] &gt;&gt; right? We're not looking at that and
[34:50] saying, "Well, with some kind of like
[34:52] Saul would look down on David and say,
[34:54] well, he's coming for my job." But we're
[34:56] looking at said, we want to prepare
[34:58] them, make them ready for that
[35:00] &gt;&gt; while they're young and tender, preach a
[35:02] gospel that they can understand,
[35:04] something that they can grab a hold of
[35:07] &gt;&gt; and be a part of. Amen.
[35:10] &gt;&gt; So, David, while Solomon was young and
[35:13] tender, he taught him to be a king. And
[35:15] there's a way to do that. I want you to
[35:17] go uh to the story of Esau and Jacob.
[35:20] And you'll find in Genesis 33 and:12
[35:23] that there's a way that you've got to
[35:25] handle those who are tender and those
[35:28] who are young. There's a way that you
[35:30] got to handle it. We're going to look at
[35:31] this for for a little bit of time
[35:33] tonight and and look at it and maybe as
[35:35] parents, as as uh as adults, as as
[35:39] elders, as I identified with the elders
[35:41] this morning now that I've turned 40,
[35:43] but and they even invited me to sit at
[35:45] their table over there. I was so
[35:47] privileged and and pleased to hear that.
[35:49] I I can sit with the elders now and hear
[35:52] their wisdom and all the wonderful
[35:54] things that they have to say. But yet,
[35:57] you know, in doing that, it's our job to
[35:59] prepare the younger people.
[36:01] &gt;&gt; And I'll say this, anybody can look over
[36:04] the at the younger people say, "They're
[36:05] not doing a good job." Anybody can
[36:07] criticize.
[36:08] &gt;&gt; Anybody can look down at people and say,
[36:10] "Well, the preachers just don't know how
[36:11] to do it no more. The people don't know
[36:12] how to do it no more. Why aren't we
[36:14] teaching them how to do it?"
[36:15] &gt;&gt; If they don't know how to do it, that's
[36:17] probably on us.
[36:19] &gt;&gt; Right.
[36:20] &gt;&gt; Right. So, instead of criticizing them,
[36:22] let's challenge ourselves. What could I
[36:24] do to help them build the temple? What
[36:25] could I do to prepare a future
[36:27] generation for a future work?
[36:30] &gt;&gt; Come on. Good.
[36:31] &gt;&gt; So, and again, you say, "Well, the
[36:33] Lord's coming." Absolutely, he's coming.
[36:35] But our job is to prepare as if as if
[36:38] tomorrow was coming, right? Because
[36:40] otherwise, tomorrow will come and we'll
[36:42] be unprepared.
[36:44] &gt;&gt; Because if the Lord comes the in the
[36:46] next six m six months or whatever,
[36:48] that's wonderful. But let me be found in
[36:50] my post to duty preparing a generation
[36:53] because I don't know when he's coming
[36:54] but I know there'll be a bride ready to
[36:56] meet him.
[36:57] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[36:57] &gt;&gt; I want to be part of that. Don't you?
[36:59] &gt;&gt; So let's do what we can. If you say all
[37:02] I can do is is pray. Well pray then. All
[37:04] I can do is go to church. Go to church.
[37:06] Show what side you're on.
[37:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. So
[37:12] &gt;&gt; now Genesis 33:12
[37:14] here, Esau and Jacob have been enemies.
[37:18] They've been enemies all their life
[37:20] and partially because of Jacob's
[37:22] malfeasants.
[37:25] Jacob was a shyster.
[37:27] &gt;&gt; He stole from Esau. He was always
[37:29] tricking him. And yet at this stage in
[37:33] their life, they both matured to the
[37:35] point where they want to make peace.
[37:37] And you remember the story how Jacob
[37:39] sent out a gift in front of him because
[37:41] he wasn't sure how Esau felt about the
[37:43] matter. And but Esau wanted to make
[37:45] peace. and they put that aside and
[37:48] become friends. You know, I think we
[37:49] ought to be able to at least become
[37:50] friends with our neighbors and
[37:52] &gt;&gt; people around us. Maybe not all of our
[37:54] neighbors, but
[37:55] &gt;&gt; but you know, those that will be
[37:57] peaceable. Paul said, "As much as is in
[37:58] you, live peaceibly with all men."
[38:01] &gt;&gt; And and so Jacob and Esau wanted to put
[38:04] those things aside and come together,
[38:06] but yet they still had a difference in
[38:08] their attitudes. Esau was a warrior. He
[38:11] was a hunter. He was somebody who' go
[38:14] went out and took what was his,
[38:16] &gt;&gt; right? Jacob wasn't that. Jacob was
[38:19] building something. He was raising
[38:21] something. And so with their different
[38:23] attitudes, they couldn't really journey
[38:26] together. They couldn't travel together
[38:29] because uh here Esau said, "Let us take
[38:31] our journey and let us go and I will go
[38:34] before thee." And he, that's Jacob, said
[38:36] to him, "My lord knoweth that the
[38:38] children are tender, right? and the
[38:41] flocks and herds with young are with me.
[38:44] And if men should overdrive them one
[38:46] day, I want you I I want us elders to
[38:48] listen. Wake up tonight and listen.
[38:51] &gt;&gt; I want us to listen. I want us parents,
[38:53] grandparents to listen.
[38:55] &gt;&gt; Because he said listen, he said he said,
[38:58] "My Lord knows the children are tender
[39:00] and the flocks and herds with young are
[39:01] with me and if men should overdrive them
[39:03] one day, all the flock will die."
[39:06] &gt;&gt; All right. Preach that. Yes. He said,
[39:09] "Let my Lord, I pray, they pass over
[39:11] before his servant, and I will lead on
[39:13] softly according as the cattle that
[39:16] goeth before me, and the children be
[39:18] able to endure
[39:20] &gt;&gt; until I come unto my Lord to fear." So,
[39:24] there's a lesson here that we can learn.
[39:26] Don't drive the church
[39:28] &gt;&gt; harder than the children can endure.
[39:31] &gt;&gt; Good,
[39:32] &gt;&gt; right? Just because you can do it don't
[39:34] mean you should do it. And I think as
[39:37] preachers sometimes we get so revelated,
[39:38] we get so far out. We've we drive the
[39:40] church to a place of revelation or or a
[39:43] place of obedience. And and I'm not
[39:45] saying those things shouldn't be
[39:46] preached, but we're driving the church
[39:47] to a place and you've left the little
[39:49] ones behind.
[39:50] &gt;&gt; And I know many times people say,
[39:51] "Brother Ben, why don't you preach this
[39:53] or that and why don't you deal with this
[39:55] in the church?" Well, there'll be a time
[39:56] to deal with it, but we can't drive the
[39:58] children farther than they're able to be
[40:00] driven,
[40:02] &gt;&gt; right? You've got to be willing like
[40:03] Jacob was to go slowly if you have to go
[40:06] slowly. Walk softly if you have to walk
[40:08] softly to be able to get them to the
[40:10] place because even if you make it, if
[40:13] you killed the flock, what good is it?
[40:17] &gt;&gt; Good.
[40:18] &gt;&gt; Very good.
[40:19] &gt;&gt; But you had your say and you said what
[40:20] you wanted to say and you you made your
[40:22] point. But what good was it?
[40:30] &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, I'm the dad. I can say what
[40:32] I want to. I'm the head of the house.
[40:33] Well, you might be able to say it.
[40:36] &gt;&gt; But if you drive the flock too hard,
[40:42] &gt;&gt; don't drive your home harder.
[40:45] &gt;&gt; Your wife and children can endure.
[40:51] &gt;&gt; The Brandom even dealt with that. He
[40:52] asked the Lord to allow him to stay in
[40:53] Jeffersonville until his wife's parents
[40:56] passed away. And because he wanted to
[40:58] make sure that his wife would be okay,
[41:01] &gt;&gt; and God allowed him to do that.
[41:03] &gt;&gt; We have to deal with them with wisdom.
[41:05] The Bible says,
[41:07] &gt;&gt; you say, "Well, but we did it. We made
[41:09] it. We we we we put them on a forced
[41:12] march and they made it. But what if the
[41:15] children fell by the way?"
[41:20] &gt;&gt; Some of y'all know what I'm talking
[41:21] about. We did that for years. That's
[41:24] right.
[41:24] &gt;&gt; Around the message. We we Well, you're
[41:26] going to go to church and you're going
[41:27] to do this and you're going to do that
[41:28] and we're going to force the march.
[41:30] You're going to look right. But we
[41:31] didn't we we weren't listening to them.
[41:35] &gt;&gt; We weren't looking to what was going on
[41:36] around us. The kids were falling by the
[41:38] way. And oh, we were professing our love
[41:40] for the message and our love for the
[41:41] Lord, but we left the children behind.
[41:44] &gt;&gt; I said we need to bring them with us.
[41:46] So, we have to walk softly and endure
[41:48] some services. Oh, I'm revelated. I
[41:50] don't need the presence of God no more.
[41:51] I don't need a powerful move of God
[41:53] anymore. I don't need the Holy Ghost no
[41:55] more. Well, you might not, but what
[41:56] about the children? You need to be able
[41:58] to walk softly with the children and let
[42:00] them be able to have an experience with
[42:02] God.
[42:03] &gt;&gt; The children aren't just at youth camps.
[42:05] The children are right here in our
[42:06] services.
[42:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:08] &gt;&gt; Good.
[42:09] &gt;&gt; We're not looking just at what's good
[42:10] for us. We're looking at what's good for
[42:12] the children and what's good for the
[42:14] flock.
[42:14] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[42:15] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? You might come to a
[42:17] service. You might say, "Well, Brother
[42:18] Ben hasn't preached nothing that helped
[42:20] me for years."
[42:22] &gt;&gt; Well, I wonder how hard you've been
[42:24] praying, you know, but
[42:26] &gt;&gt; but you might say that you I don't ever
[42:28] get fed,
[42:29] &gt;&gt; but are you willing to put that aside
[42:31] for a moment? Say, Lord, let me if if if
[42:34] Brother Ben and Brother Joel or
[42:35] whoever's preaching, if they have to go
[42:37] softly so the children can understand
[42:39] it, let me be willing to put up with
[42:41] that, recognizing that God cares about
[42:43] the children, too.
[42:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:48] Now, people say, "Well, I wouldn't sit
[42:49] through a youth service. I wouldn't want
[42:50] to have to deal with that." Well, you
[42:52] won't have to deal with them forever.
[42:55] &gt;&gt; You only got a small amount of time.
[43:02] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham dealt with a young boy
[43:04] in the prayer line. I just want you to
[43:07] listen to a prophet's heart.
[43:09] He said, 'How do you do, Laddy? My I
[43:11] like boys with haircuts like that.
[43:14] Brother Brandham, you're a prophet. Why
[43:17] are you noticing this boy's haircut?
[43:22] &gt;&gt; You know, a lot of times kids in church,
[43:24] they feel like no, they don't have
[43:26] nobody notices them. If you say
[43:29] something about that, it'll make a
[43:30] difference to them.
[43:33] &gt;&gt; He said, "You love the Lord." You do.
[43:35] Well, Brother Brandon never dealt with
[43:36] adults like this.
[43:39] You watch how his tone of voice changes.
[43:41] How gently he deals with children in the
[43:43] prayer life. Yes, sir. Come on.
[43:45] &gt;&gt; He said, "Well, I think you're a fine
[43:47] boy." And now, any boy that loves the
[43:49] Lord and loves his mother and father, I
[43:51] think that's a good boy. I think he
[43:52] can't go wrong doing that.
[43:54] &gt;&gt; He said, "Now, what if Jesus was here
[43:56] tonight and you were standing before him
[43:57] as you as you are, Brother Brandham?" He
[43:59] said, "Now, Jesus would know just what
[44:01] was wrong with you. He'd come over and
[44:04] pick up his ch pick up children as he
[44:05] did, lay his hands on them, and bless
[44:07] them. You'd get well, wouldn't you?
[44:09] That's right. You'd get well. But of
[44:11] course, Jesus has went away and has sent
[44:12] back his gifts into the church. Is that
[44:14] right? Mighty young to have that, son.
[44:16] He's He's asking for a response from the
[44:18] young man. He said, "Mighty young to
[44:20] have that son. Have a coughing.
[44:22] Asthmatic like in the throat. Isn't that
[44:24] right? Asthmatic cough laying down many
[44:26] times. You have to raise it. Just cough
[44:28] you and hurts you so bad. That's a
[44:30] horrible thing. God bless you, little
[44:32] boy. You got a very tender spirit.
[44:35] &gt;&gt; That's your mother sitting right there,
[44:36] isn't it? You believe too. That's your
[44:38] little sister sitting right there also.
[44:40] She's got sinus trouble. Isn't that
[44:41] right, honey? Your mother also has hay
[44:43] fever. Isn't that right? She has dropsy
[44:44] also. He said, "God bless this little
[44:46] lad with his tears running down his
[44:48] cheeks. Let the mother stand. Little
[44:50] girl stand while the spirit of God is
[44:52] here tenderly. Put your hands over on
[44:53] mother, sister, and mother to the girl."
[44:55] And he prayed for him. He said, "May
[44:57] they all get well?" And he said, "Look,
[44:59] little lad. What's your name? See your
[45:01] asthmatic conditions gone. If all this
[45:03] dust on the floor and things like you'd
[45:05] be coughing your head off if you'd catch
[45:06] that you're healed now. God bless you.
[45:08] He said God and and may God be with you.
[45:11] &gt;&gt; Now why did brother Brandon take so much
[45:13] time with this particular person because
[45:15] he wasn't an adult. There are times and
[45:17] I almost feel bad for the people when
[45:19] brother Brandon will call someone
[45:20] through the prayer line and he'll say,
[45:21] "Do you believe if I just laid hands on
[45:23] you that God would heal you?"
[45:25] &gt;&gt; And didn't tell you anything. They say
[45:26] yes. He'd lay hands on them, pray a
[45:28] little short prayer and send them on
[45:29] down. almost felt bad for the people
[45:32] &gt;&gt; because they didn't have discernment.
[45:33] But brother Brandham could catch that
[45:34] they were mature enough to to accept
[45:36] that and believe that and receive their
[45:38] healing.
[45:39] &gt;&gt; But sometimes you got to spend time with
[45:41] the children.
[45:43] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[45:45] &gt;&gt; We want to rush through our services and
[45:47] get everything done in a certain amount
[45:48] of time so we can go home, kick back in
[45:50] the easy chair. Believe Believe me, I'm
[45:53] 40 now. I do, too.
[45:56] I want nothing more than to than to be
[45:57] done with service on Sunday and go home
[45:59] and sit in my easy chair and have
[46:01] somebody bring me a sweet tea or unsweet
[46:03] tea as the case might be. And I want
[46:06] nothing more than that. But I'll tell
[46:07] you this, it's worth it maybe to give a
[46:09] little bit of time to the children. Let
[46:11] them have a little bit of time to
[46:12] worship God and serve God and learn what
[46:15] it's like to be in the presence of God.
[46:17] It's worth it to pray through and have
[46:19] church even if we don't feel like it.
[46:22] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. In moments when we
[46:23] don't even feel like it, maybe in an
[46:24] afternoon when it's tiring and
[46:26] everything, it's worth it to raise our
[46:28] hands and worship God because the
[46:30] children are watching.
[46:32] &gt;&gt; Good,
[46:34] buddy.
[46:35] &gt;&gt; Very good.
[46:36] &gt;&gt; Again, at an altar call, brother Brand,
[46:39] I'm dealing with the young people and he
[46:40] says, "That's fine." He said, "Just keep
[46:42] raising your hand as you feel that
[46:44] Christ." He said, "God bless you, my
[46:46] brother. God bless you, little girl.
[46:47] That's fine. God bless you." The little
[46:49] colored girl is here with her hand up.
[46:50] "God bless you, honey. He said, 'You may
[46:53] think you were too young, about 12 years
[46:54] old.
[46:55] &gt;&gt; We got a whole
[46:58] gang, I guess you could say, of 12 year
[47:01] olds, 11, 12, 13 year olds. He said,
[47:04] "You might think you were too young."
[47:06] No, you're not. It's the Holy Spirit.
[47:09] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[47:09] &gt;&gt; Speaking to your little tender heart,
[47:11] honey.
[47:12] &gt;&gt; Just love him.
[47:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[47:13] &gt;&gt; Come to him now by faith. Look how he
[47:14] deals with her. Come up believing and
[47:16] say, "Lord, be merciful to me a sinner."
[47:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:20] &gt;&gt; He will do it.
[47:22] Someone else while we're waiting just a
[47:23] few moments longer. He said, "Oh, many
[47:25] 15 or 20 has held up their hand. God
[47:27] bless you, young fellow." That's a
[47:29] wonderful start to make right now in the
[47:31] adolescent age.
[47:33] Again, in a baptism, I'm just giving you
[47:35] different examples, different scenarios
[47:37] where brother Brandham deals with young
[47:38] people. In a baptism, he said, "You a
[47:40] little scared to come out here, honey?"
[47:41] He's doing a baptism and a little girl
[47:43] comes up the line and with her mother
[47:47] and she's scared to come into the water
[47:50] because the water's cold. I've seen
[47:53] that. I've seen a little ones get into
[47:54] the water and just catch their breath
[47:56] like that. And that would be
[47:58] embarrassing to a parent. Now, just be
[48:00] honest. If your little one wanted to be
[48:02] baptized and they refused to go in the
[48:03] water, wouldn't that be embarrassing?
[48:05] Watch how Brother Brandham handles that.
[48:07] &gt;&gt; He said, "What do you think? Do you want
[48:08] to try it?" The mother says, "Well, it's
[48:10] just up to her. She'd been begging me
[48:11] and I tried to talk her out of it.
[48:14] He said, "You want to be baptized,
[48:15] honey? You want to, honey? Want to come
[48:17] with brother Brandham in the water?"
[48:19] &gt;&gt; "You afraid to come out?" He said, "You
[48:20] want to come, sweetheart?" "All right,
[48:22] sister. It may be a little bit scary to
[48:23] her. Hand that to her." And brother
[48:25] Brandham has him close the curtain. He
[48:26] just so gentlemanly with it.
[48:28] &gt;&gt; And he he said the little girl was
[48:30] standing here just now to be baptized.
[48:31] She wanted to be baptized, but she was
[48:33] afraid the water was too cold for her.
[48:35] And so her mother, well, she asked me
[48:36] what I thought. I said, "Maybe if she'd
[48:38] be scared. I wouldn't want to scare
[48:39] her." She was very small anyhow. But she
[48:42] talks about she wants to be baptized. So
[48:44] she thought she'd wait till the next
[48:45] baptism. Maybe the water be a little
[48:47] warmer.
[48:48] He said, "So that's mighty sweet." The
[48:50] mother, we pray God. He said, "Let's
[48:52] offer prayer for the little girl." He
[48:53] begins to pray. He said, "Lord Jesus, we
[48:55] thank you for that little thing. It
[48:57] should be a rebuke to older people
[49:00] &gt;&gt; to see that when that little heart is
[49:02] tender and young, she wants to come."
[49:04] But the random didn't blame her. Right.
[49:06] &gt;&gt; Now, if you get an older person that's
[49:08] coming, they ought to know they're going
[49:09] to have to get in the water.
[49:11] &gt;&gt; And it may be cold. Like, you'd think
[49:13] differently about that. But a young
[49:14] person, a child, he's it wasn't that
[49:17] that's the way she felt. She didn't want
[49:18] to come. It was too cold. But it was in
[49:20] her heart to come.
[49:21] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandon said here, when that
[49:23] little heart is tender and young, she
[49:24] wants to come. So, so Lord, shows that
[49:27] you can deal with a heart when it
[49:28] becomes humble and simple. May it be an
[49:31] example, Lord, that you can deal with
[49:33] people. I pray that you'll be with the
[49:35] little girl and help her. May she get
[49:36] older and stronger and bigger where she
[49:38] can be baptized in the name of your son.
[49:41] Another altar call. Brother Brandham, I
[49:42] hope I'm not boring you tonight. We're
[49:44] going to run through a few of these and
[49:45] we'll go on. Brother said, "God bless
[49:47] you way back there in the back. I see it
[49:48] like a family standing." He said, "God
[49:50] bless you, young fell." That's very
[49:51] fine. He said, "God bless you, little
[49:53] boy." Isn't that strange? He said,
[49:54] "These little boys up there not over 10,
[49:56] 12 years old." You say, "They don't."
[49:58] Oh, yes they do. suffer little children
[50:01] to come unto me and forbid them not.
[50:03] Such is the kingdom.
[50:05] &gt;&gt; I want to see a revival among our youth.
[50:07] Let's get them let's get them attracted
[50:08] by the message of the hour while they're
[50:10] still young. I remember things that were
[50:12] preached when I was 10 or 12 years old.
[50:14] I remember what it was like to be in the
[50:16] house of God at that age. I remember
[50:17] feeling the presence of the Lord.
[50:19] They'll remember that when they're
[50:20] older.
[50:22] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[50:23] &gt;&gt; Said their little hearts hasn't been
[50:25] pulled through too much stuff yet.
[50:26] &gt;&gt; Right. They're tender and they can
[50:29] easily receive Christ. The spirit knocks
[50:32] and all they know to do is say yes Lord.
[50:36] Oh that we could be tender like that
[50:37] tonight church that the spirit can knock
[50:39] in my heart and I can say yes Lord.
[50:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said I love those little
[50:45] fellows that does that.
[50:48] &gt;&gt; Again he said there's here's a little
[50:50] girl standing here. Mother standing here
[50:51] holding two little girls. Little things
[50:52] come up weeping. I wonder if a child
[50:54] children don't sometimes condemn the
[50:56] adult
[50:57] &gt;&gt; from their tender little heart.
[50:59] &gt;&gt; They haven't pulled it through all kinds
[51:00] of disappointments of the world.
[51:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[51:05] &gt;&gt; Good.
[51:05] &gt;&gt; There been a whole lot of people that
[51:06] didn't come to an altar because they've
[51:08] been disappointed.
[51:10] &gt;&gt; Maybe disappointed by a preacher
[51:11] disappointed by the altar.
[51:13] &gt;&gt; Disappointed because they maybe they
[51:14] didn't get. But you watch little
[51:16] children, they'll come again and again
[51:17] and again. Why? Because they haven't
[51:19] been hardened yet.
[51:21] &gt;&gt; They're still tender and sweet. He said,
[51:23] "I'm watching these two little girls
[51:24] hugged up." He said, "With against the
[51:26] lady, just like they was looking for
[51:28] something to happen." He said, "Sure,
[51:30] God speaks to his little children." You
[51:32] believe God speaks to you, you young
[51:33] people. You believe God speaks to you.
[51:36] Does he speak to you? Come on, church.
[51:37] Does he speak to young people? I believe
[51:39] he does.
[51:41] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[51:42] &gt;&gt; He said God speaks to little children.
[51:44] The Bible said, "Suffer little children
[51:45] and come to me. Forbid them not." He
[51:47] said, "I see a little mother here
[51:48] holding her baby, a sweet little baby
[51:50] holding in her arm. She's come here now
[51:52] to be reconciled to Christ. He said,
[51:53] "Blessed are you."
[51:55] &gt;&gt; He said, "A young man holding a young
[51:56] wife." I suppose he said, "Standing
[51:58] there holding her. She's weeping." He's
[52:00] got his head bowed in reverence. Do you
[52:02] know that's the works of the Holy
[52:04] Spirit?
[52:05] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon didn't just tell them,
[52:06] "Oh, you need to just leave and receive
[52:08] the word and come up to our level of
[52:10] understanding and then you won't do that
[52:11] stuff no more." But he let young people
[52:13] be young people and young parents be
[52:15] young parents. And people use an altar
[52:17] for what it was made to for. Oh God,
[52:22] &gt;&gt; good
[52:24] &gt;&gt; S. Oh, there's little browneyed girl
[52:26] looking at me about seven or eight years
[52:27] old. Little brown eyes and brown hair. I
[52:29] that little baby back here looked at me
[52:30] this morning and I just about cracked up
[52:32] cuz that's a miracle.
[52:35] &gt;&gt; And I know several of these young people
[52:36] are miracles.
[52:38] &gt;&gt; They're miracles. They got there's
[52:40] something about them just attracted to
[52:41] the word of the Lord and attracted to
[52:43] the the worship of God and they're
[52:45] miracles. And and I love to see that. at
[52:48] him and brother Brandon talks about her
[52:49] face she's expecting something she may
[52:51] be Spanish she said I see a lovely young
[52:53] woman just at the crossroads of life
[52:55] with her head bowed in reverence her
[52:56] arms folded he said I see others gray
[52:58] hairs their hair heads bowed down this
[53:00] is a sacred moment
[53:02] &gt;&gt; yes
[53:03] &gt;&gt; again another another place he said I
[53:04] see you over here on my left some little
[53:06] children he said you know the scripture
[53:08] speaks of a little child leading them in
[53:10] Isaiah the 10th chapter their heart has
[53:12] not been pulled through so much of the
[53:14] world he said they're young and tender
[53:16] they love God loves him. He can talk to
[53:18] them. And so David said, "While Solomon
[53:21] is young and tender, let me do the
[53:23] things that need to be done. Let me
[53:25] prepare during this time. Let me prepare
[53:28] abundantly."
[53:30] &gt;&gt; Cuz I know there's something for these
[53:32] young people to do.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; Listen, he said, "Their heart's not been
[53:37] pulled through so much. They're young
[53:38] and tender. They love God. God loves
[53:39] them. He can talk to them. We've seen,"
[53:41] he said, "We've seen so many
[53:42] disappointments and things. It's hard
[53:45] for our hearts and many times we pulled
[53:49] it through old True Story magazines. How
[53:52] many of you have ever read a true story
[53:54] magazine?
[53:57] I see two.
[54:00] I know she hasn't.
[54:04] A True Story magazine. You know, I had
[54:06] to look it up in the back. I'll be
[54:08] honest with you. I had never read a True
[54:10] Story magazine. So I looked up to see
[54:11] what it was and I just assumed it some
[54:14] kind of bad magazine. It was a magazine
[54:16] where people told stories
[54:19] and it basically was it was a kind of a
[54:21] pre-invention if I understood it
[54:23] correctly of social media
[54:26] and brother Brandon said people would
[54:28] read that and pull oh my pull their
[54:32] spirit through that and it hardened
[54:35] their heart.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah. It was 1950s Tik Tok.
[54:42] &gt;&gt; People telling their story, telling
[54:44] stuff that they shouldn't be telling,
[54:45] you know, stuff that kind of risque and
[54:47] stuff like that. And pull through.
[54:50] &gt;&gt; You pull yourself through that. You can
[54:52] only watch so much of that till your
[54:54] heart gets hard.
[54:55] &gt;&gt; I'm preaching to you tonight.
[54:57] &gt;&gt; If I was Brother Windle, I'd say I'm
[54:59] preaching better than you're amening.
[55:04] Now, we don't have True Story magazine
[55:06] today, but we have a lot of other
[55:07] things.
[55:09] &gt;&gt; Our hearts get pulled through it.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; Good sir.
[55:14] &gt;&gt; He said, "We should have never been
[55:15] there." He said, "It's callous it." He
[55:18] said, "God will take every callous off
[55:20] you if you just let him make you
[55:22] tender." Oh, isn't that what you want
[55:24] today? Sweet, kindhearted. Amen. Loving,
[55:27] forgiving one another. If you'll just
[55:29] have faith, just believe. He said, I'm
[55:31] just waiting a moment. Again, he said
[55:33] somebody else, yes, little boy sitting
[55:34] here, sometimes them little hearts
[55:36] hasn't been pulled through so many
[55:37] disappointments and things of the world,
[55:39] they're tender. He said, you know, the
[55:41] Bible said in Isaiah 10, a child shall
[55:42] leave them. Why don't you raise your
[55:43] hand before we stop? He said, God bless
[55:45] the young girl. Raise your hand. I I I
[55:48] want I feel the bump. He said, God bless
[55:50] you, young lady. God be with you. That's
[55:51] a gallant thing to do. Don't fear. It's
[55:54] the greatest thing you've ever done,
[55:55] honey. Someday when death comes, you'll
[55:57] remember you did the right thing. You'll
[55:59] remember that before that time happens
[56:01] again. He said, "There's a little girl
[56:02] sitting here. Looks to be about 10 years
[56:04] old." He raised her hand a few moments
[56:06] ago. She wanted Jesus. About the age of
[56:08] my little Becky, I guess, at home. My
[56:09] little Rebecca. I noticed a little girl
[56:11] come up last night when she stood at the
[56:12] altar. No more than she'd stood there.
[56:14] She started speaking with tongues. Oh,
[56:16] no.
[56:19] Brother Brandon was not condemning her
[56:20] for it.
[56:21] &gt;&gt; Come on. I know there's church order. I
[56:25] know that. And I believe in church
[56:26] order. I believe we ought to have church
[56:27] order.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; I believe in everything brother Brandham
[56:30] said about that. But sometimes
[56:34] &gt;&gt; sometimes you got to let young people be
[56:36] young people
[56:37] &gt;&gt; and get overcome by the presence of God.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; And I think sometimes us older folks
[56:42] need to get in that condition too where
[56:44] we get so overcome by the presence of
[56:45] God until we can't talk no more until
[56:48] his presence is just right there with
[56:49] us.
[56:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; Yes. He said some he said someone told
[56:53] me some of the brethren she was running
[56:55] around running all over the church
[56:58] and all the deacons said oh no
[57:04] what what brother Brandon what are you
[57:05] saying she was running all over the
[57:07] church speaking in tonesues and singing
[57:09] in tonesues and everything. How the Lord
[57:13] blessed that little child.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; Get her when her heart's young and
[57:18] tender.
[57:21] How many of you remember what that was
[57:23] like?
[57:24] &gt;&gt; I know it's been a long time ago and
[57:26] there's been a lot of True Story
[57:27] magazines, but do you remember?
[57:29] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; Come on, preach.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; Can you remember what it was like to be
[57:33] so young and tender and you hear the
[57:35] gospel and it just break your heart up?
[57:38] &gt;&gt; And a preacher didn't have to preach
[57:39] real good. He just had to stand up there
[57:41] and read the word and preach a little
[57:42] bit and you'd just feel so convicted and
[57:44] tears would stream down your face and
[57:46] you'd stay there in worship or you'd be
[57:48] down on an altar and you'd maybe start
[57:50] talking in another language and and and
[57:52] and some of you you're almost ashamed
[57:54] now to admit you ever spoke in tongues.
[57:56] But I'll tell you what, God still moves
[57:57] in those things.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; Oh my. He said someone told me she would
[58:02] run all over the church speaking in
[58:04] tong. But he said it's cuz she her heart
[58:05] was young and tender before she pulled
[58:07] it through old true story magazines and
[58:09] the filth of the world got her little
[58:11] heart all calloused. I like to see the
[58:13] little ones come.
[58:15] Brother Brandham talked about he was
[58:17] given an altar caller. He about about to
[58:19] give one and Sunday school let out. And
[58:23] the little children begin to come to the
[58:25] altar straight out of Sunday school.
[58:27] He said three little boys just walks
[58:29] right out real fast, tears in their
[58:30] eyes, kneels down by the side of the
[58:32] altar. Of course, they're forgiven. How
[58:35] you young people, listen to me. Listen
[58:37] to what brother Brandon was telling you.
[58:39] He said, "They was forgiven before they
[58:40] even left their seats."
[58:43] &gt;&gt; You come up here to the altar and you
[58:44] want prayer and you got to tell me,
[58:46] "Well, I didn't get anything." No. The
[58:47] fact that you came Yes,
[58:49] &gt;&gt; sir.
[58:49] &gt;&gt; Listen to you were forgiven before you
[58:50] ever left your seat.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; When you Their little mind was made up,
[58:55] they just come forward and kneel down
[58:56] there to let the people know whose side
[58:58] they're on this morning. He said, "I
[59:00] think there would be some older people
[59:02] would like to do this."
[59:04] &gt;&gt; Just like to kneel down and say, "Lord,
[59:06] I've wandered far away from the We got
[59:07] any older people here tonight that would
[59:09] like to do that to have wandered far
[59:11] away from the path. I've had so much
[59:12] doubt and sometimes I wandered out and
[59:14] got in sin. I'd want to come back before
[59:16] it's too late. God, I'd like to come."
[59:19] &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh." He said, "I'd just really
[59:21] like to come and kneel down." He said,
[59:23] "Now, Arthur Beams, three little girls,
[59:25] there's a group of little boys, group of
[59:27] little girls about the same size. They
[59:28] come up here, kneel down, said, "It
[59:30] seems to be the children this morning.
[59:31] Little fellas coming out from Sister
[59:33] Arnold's little class, they come
[59:35] straight out of Sunday school,
[59:37] &gt;&gt; consecrating their lives." The whole
[59:39] altar to my right. He said, "It's full
[59:40] of little children." And brother
[59:42] Brandham says, "I guess I had need an
[59:43] altar call." And he he sings, "Lord, I'm
[59:45] coming home." He said, "For the older
[59:46] folks."
[59:48] No older folks came, but the young
[59:51] people did. Amen.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; And brother Bham said, "Heavenly Father,
[59:54] if there's a coming tomorrow, if Jesus
[59:55] should carry for another 10 or 15 years,
[59:57] these will be the boys and girls that
[59:59] will pack this message along to other
[1:00:01] generations to come. No doubt in my
[1:00:03] mind, Lord, but what all the days of
[1:00:04] their life they'll remember coming up to
[1:00:06] this altar."
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; Yes. And
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; their little jewels, Lord, their young
[1:00:09] and tender little hearts are convinced
[1:00:11] this morning, not even hearing all the
[1:00:12] message just come out of the room from
[1:00:14] hearing our sister Arnold speaking. You
[1:00:17] you Sunday school teachers don't know
[1:00:18] what you're doing back there. These
[1:00:20] young people were moved not by the
[1:00:22] sermon, not by brother Brandham's
[1:00:24] sermon,
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; but by a Sunday school teacher.
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; That when they got in the presence of
[1:00:32] God in a place where there was an altar,
[1:00:33] they immediately come to the altar.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; Say, "God, let us be tender like that.
[1:00:38] Let us be young like that."
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; In that way.
[1:00:43] Amen. He said, "They're little jewels,
[1:00:46] Lord. They're young and tender, not even
[1:00:49] hearing the message. Just come out of
[1:00:50] the room, move up around the altar,
[1:00:52] giving their little lives to thee. He
[1:00:53] said, "Now, Father, I've got through
[1:00:55] speaking that in us dwells the Holy
[1:00:56] Spirit. This holy faith with this spirit
[1:00:58] does all things." And I believe that
[1:01:00] this very hour.
[1:01:02] Oh my. He said, "You forgive every sin
[1:01:04] they've committed. I'm asking you with
[1:01:06] all faith that's in my heart. You will
[1:01:07] keep their little lives down through the
[1:01:08] road. May they never stray from the
[1:01:11] way." He said, "This truly is a strange
[1:01:14] thing." The spirit said this morning
[1:01:16] we'd see something strange. He said,
[1:01:18] "God, if you quit dealing with the
[1:01:19] others, take little children."
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you preach, and I'm just being
[1:01:26] honest with you. And I know as we get
[1:01:28] older, I get harder to preach to as I
[1:01:30] get older. You just heard so much
[1:01:32] preaching.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; We just heard so much and we just It's
[1:01:38] like, "Amuse me, pastor.
[1:01:42] make me feel good. I'm just opening my
[1:01:45] heart to you tonight.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; Make me cry.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; And yet the little children many times
[1:01:52] can be dealt with in a different way if
[1:01:55] their hearts haven't gotten hardened
[1:01:56] already. It seems like their hearts get
[1:01:58] hardened at a younger at a younger age.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; But you see children, God will deal with
[1:02:04] the little child or young people. Well,
[1:02:06] God will deal with young people in a way
[1:02:08] maybe that is hard because we we just
[1:02:11] we've heard so much.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; But if we just take a minute and think
[1:02:15] about what we're hearing.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; Just pause a moment. Let that sink in.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; If you ever think about what God done
[1:02:26] for you, if you could if you could go
[1:02:28] back
[1:02:29] if you could go back and think about
[1:02:31] what God did for you. He said, "You're
[1:02:32] the virtuous, sinless bride of Jesus
[1:02:34] Christ." Pause for a moment.
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; Press pause on the tape player.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; Never heard anybody tell you to press
[1:02:41] pause. Did you
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; press pause on the tape player? Think
[1:02:45] about that for a moment.
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; He a vindicated prophet stood there and
[1:02:49] said, "You never did it in the first
[1:02:51] place."
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; But we've heard it so much. It's just
[1:02:56] like brother Brandon talked about that
[1:02:57] that little child that had everything
[1:02:59] shook in front of him so much he just
[1:03:00] didn't move for nothing anymore.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; Right. Say, "God, help me to be tender
[1:03:05] to the spirit of God.
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; Help me to move."
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon said, "We in this
[1:03:12] morning, the altar call, there's not one
[1:03:13] adult, but the whole group of little
[1:03:14] children come up." Yet, it was a great
[1:03:16] message of hard understanding, even to
[1:03:18] adults, but the children caught the
[1:03:22] spirit of it.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; Listen, if you didn't understand what I
[1:03:25] was trying to say, I hope you can
[1:03:27] understand the spirit of it.
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; If you couldn't catch the meaning, I
[1:03:31] hope you can catch the spirit. Good.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, we thank you for them.
[1:03:38] Father, I give them to you as your
[1:03:40] servant as the trophies of this meeting,
[1:03:41] remembering the ever presence of the
[1:03:43] water of life will flow with them as
[1:03:45] long as they live.
[1:03:47] He said, "May they have faith now in
[1:03:48] just what's happening that God pulled
[1:03:50] them from their seat and sent them up
[1:03:51] here. May they have faith in that God
[1:03:53] all the days of their life. May their
[1:03:54] little spirits be brought to you in the
[1:03:56] day of their death, brought back to
[1:03:57] their body in the day of the
[1:03:58] resurrection. They are yours, Father. We
[1:04:00] give them to you through Jesus name."
[1:04:02] Right?
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; See, God deals with young people in a
[1:04:05] special way. Jesus did the same thing in
[1:04:07] Matthew chapter 18. I'll hurry to save
[1:04:09] time. It says, "At the same time came
[1:04:10] the disciples unto Jesus, saying, "Who
[1:04:12] is the greatest in the kingdom of
[1:04:14] heaven? Who has the best ministry? Who
[1:04:16] do you think the what Jesus, what's your
[1:04:18] top 10 preachers?"
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; And Jesus calls a little child
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; unto him.
[1:04:31] and set him in the midst of them. So, in
[1:04:33] other words, here's the disciples in
[1:04:34] their little preacher group, you know,
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; looking around. Peter says, "He gonna
[1:04:41] say me?"
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; You know, John's over there said, "I'm
[1:04:44] the beloved." you know,
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; little group of preachers, 12 preachers,
[1:04:52] and Jesus calls a little child and sets
[1:04:55] them right in the middle of them and
[1:04:57] said at the preacher table said,
[1:04:59] "Verily, I say unto you, except you be
[1:05:02] converted."
[1:05:05] Tell them they're not even saved yet.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; Become as little children, you shall not
[1:05:10] enter into the kingdom of heaven.
[1:05:12] Whosoever therefore shall humble himself
[1:05:14] as this little child, whose same is
[1:05:16] greatest in the kingdom of heaven, and
[1:05:17] who so shall receive one such little
[1:05:20] child in my name receiveth me. But who
[1:05:22] so shall offend one of these little ones
[1:05:25] which believe in me?
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; It were better for him that a millstone,
[1:05:30] look how drastic this is, were hanged
[1:05:32] about his neck and that he were drowned
[1:05:34] in the depth of the sea.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; Right? Why? Because children have to be
[1:05:40] cared for.
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; Right? Children are our responsibility.
[1:05:44] And if God's given us children in the
[1:05:46] church, we talked this morning about how
[1:05:48] many children God has given us here in
[1:05:49] the church. If God has given us
[1:05:51] children, we got a church full of
[1:05:53] children. We are responsible to those
[1:05:55] children.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; And we're not we can't just think about
[1:06:02] ourselves. We got to die to ourselves
[1:06:04] and let the seed of tomorrow be planted
[1:06:06] in the soil of our death to ourselves.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; Yes. Right.
[1:06:12] Sometimes kids need help.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; Now, David realized that. I'm going to
[1:06:15] start preaching now. That was all just
[1:06:17] the foundation.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; We won't take much longer. Are you still
[1:06:20] with me tonight?
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; Sometimes young people need help.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; That shouldn't be uh that shouldn't be
[1:06:28] news to any of us.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; Sometimes old people need help.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; Sometimes preachers need help,
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; but some especially young people need
[1:06:37] help. And David understood that when it
[1:06:40] come to dealing with Solomon. Look at 1
[1:06:42] Chronicles chapter 29 and verse one.
[1:06:44] Furthermore, David the king said unto
[1:06:46] all the congregation, Solomon, my son,
[1:06:48] whom alone God hath chosen is yet young
[1:06:52] and tender, and the work is great. For
[1:06:55] the palace is not for man. He said,
[1:06:58] we're building something, but not for
[1:06:59] man,
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; but for the Lord God.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; We're not building a house for a man.
[1:07:04] We're building a temple of the Holy
[1:07:05] Ghost. Yes,
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; sir.
[1:07:07] Come on now.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; He said, "Now I have prepared with all
[1:07:11] my might."
[1:07:13] I wonder how many of us could say this,
[1:07:15] church.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; I've prepared with all my might. I've
[1:07:18] done everything I can do for my family.
[1:07:21] I've done everything I can do for my
[1:07:23] church.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; I've done everything I can do for the
[1:07:25] people in my area.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:07:28] I have prepared with all my might for
[1:07:31] the house of my God, the gold for things
[1:07:33] to be made of gold, the silver for
[1:07:34] things of silver, the brass for things
[1:07:36] of brass, the iron for things of iron,
[1:07:38] wood for things of wood, onyx stones and
[1:07:40] stones to be set, glistening stones of
[1:07:43] diverse colors, and all manners of
[1:07:44] precious stones, marble stones in
[1:07:46] abundance.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; Moreover, because I have set my
[1:07:50] affection, other words, because I love
[1:07:52] the house of my God,
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; right? I have of mine own proper good of
[1:07:56] gold and silver
[1:07:58] which I have given to the house of my
[1:08:00] God over
[1:08:02] and above all that I have prepared for
[1:08:04] the holy house. So when he got done
[1:08:06] preparing he gave a little more.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; Oh my
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; even 3,000 of gold of the gold of oper
[1:08:13] 7,000 talents of refined silver to
[1:08:15] overlay the walls of the houses with
[1:08:18] all. Remember he would never walk down
[1:08:20] those hallways. He would never go into
[1:08:23] the holy of holies. Come on.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; But he he was able to give the gold
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; that would be laid over the cedar.
[1:08:31] He said the gold for things of gold, the
[1:08:33] silver and for all manner the silver for
[1:08:36] things of silver for all manner of work
[1:08:37] to be made by the hands of artificers.
[1:08:40] And who then is willing?
[1:08:42] Now I believe this is a challenge
[1:08:44] tonight. This a challenge to us as a
[1:08:46] church.
[1:08:47] He said, "I've done everything I can do.
[1:08:49] I believe the message of this hour did
[1:08:51] the job it was supposed to do.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; I believe God sent a prophet that didn't
[1:08:56] stop short.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad of that? God sent a
[1:08:59] prophet that didn't stop short.
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; I believe God brought a message to us
[1:09:03] that was difficult and and he was cast
[1:09:05] out and rejected. But he did it so we
[1:09:07] could have material that we could build
[1:09:10] the house of God with.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? He He made a way.
[1:09:14] He made a preparation. He said, "I must
[1:09:16] decrease that he might increase." He
[1:09:18] said, "Behold the lamb of God which
[1:09:19] takes away the sin of the world." He did
[1:09:21] that and God did that through him for
[1:09:23] us.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; And after all that has been done.
[1:09:29] Oh church, then the cry goes out, "Who
[1:09:33] then is willing
[1:09:37] to consecrate his service
[1:09:40] this day unto the Lord?"
[1:09:42] It's one thing to watch somebody else
[1:09:44] and to go by and see David. So, David's
[1:09:47] going to build a good temple for us.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; David's building a good temple for our
[1:09:52] children.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; But who is willing?
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; I take that as a challenge to myself,
[1:09:58] to my generation,
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; to those who are now we say middle-aged.
[1:10:06] We got a kids coming up. Who is willing?
[1:10:11] to go above and beyond.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; To do more than a previous generation.
[1:10:15] Come on, church. We got anybody willing
[1:10:16] today? Who is willing?
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; To do what needs to be done,
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; sir.
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; So the children can have church.
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Who is willing
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; to do what needs to be done so the
[1:10:31] presence of God can fill the temple and
[1:10:33] the post can can move at the noise of
[1:10:35] the sound of the worship of God? Who is
[1:10:37] willing to do what needs to be done?
[1:10:39] Who's willing to put in the work? Who's
[1:10:41] willing to pick up a shovel? Who's
[1:10:42] willing to be what God called them to
[1:10:44] be? Come on, church. Who's willing to be
[1:10:46] a real man, a real woman, a real mother,
[1:10:48] a real a real child, a real person that
[1:10:50] God wants you to be?
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; Who is willing to consecrate his
[1:10:54] service?
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah. If you don't do it, somebody will.
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; Somebody will.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; But Lord, let it be me.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; Let it be me.
[1:11:09] who will give up their home for
[1:11:11] teenagers to sit up in the tall hours of
[1:11:13] the night.
[1:11:15] Oh, it got quiet.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; Those of us who have worked with young
[1:11:22] people, we've been there and done that.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; Who's willing to clean up after the mess
[1:11:29] they make?
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; We're teaching our young girls, young
[1:11:33] boys to clean up. I appreciate that. I'm
[1:11:36] glad that they're doing it. But when
[1:11:37] they can't clean up after themselves or
[1:11:39] they don't,
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; who's willing to do it?
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; Who's willing to not complain but to
[1:11:47] help?
[1:11:57] This actually a former pastor of mine
[1:11:59] brought this to my attention years ago
[1:12:01] and it stuck with me.
[1:12:03] In Proverbs 14:4, where no oxen are, the
[1:12:06] crib is clean.
[1:12:08] So if you want a clean crib,
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; with none of that stuff that oxen
[1:12:15] produce,
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; just don't have any children. Oxen,
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; right? If you don't have any cows, you
[1:12:27] won't have any smell.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; But you also won't have any cows,
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; I love how simple the Bible is, right?
[1:12:36] It's just
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; where no oxen are, the crib is clean.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; Listen, think about this. I'm going to
[1:12:45] paint utopia for some of us older
[1:12:46] people.
[1:12:48] Where no children are, no one runs into
[1:12:52] you at the food line.
[1:13:00] No one leaves their stuff all over the
[1:13:01] churchyard
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; where no children are.
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; No one
[1:13:11] No one makes us sit through long Sunday
[1:13:14] night services
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; where no children are. There's no
[1:13:20] cleanup,
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; right? We never get offended.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; Well, doesn't that sound good? You know,
[1:13:26] praise God.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; But, Brother JT, you and I have been in
[1:13:32] churches where there's no children.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; Where there are no children, there's no
[1:13:37] future.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; There's nothing to look forward to.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; Because no matter how dedicated you are,
[1:13:45] if there are no children, there's no way
[1:13:46] to to move forward.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:50] Where no oxen are, the crib is clean.
[1:13:52] But much increase
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; is by the strength of the ox. Because
[1:13:57] there's coming a generation that's going
[1:13:58] to be able to carry things that you
[1:14:00] can't carry no more. You might have done
[1:14:02] it for years and years and years, but
[1:14:04] there's coming a generation of deacons
[1:14:05] and trustees and church members and and
[1:14:08] and pray prayer warriors and and
[1:14:10] preachers and singers and preachers
[1:14:12] wives and mothers. There's coming a
[1:14:14] generation of people who got strength in
[1:14:16] their body to do what needs to be done.
[1:14:18] So I say, "Let the crib be dirty." If
[1:14:19] it's got to be dirty, let the let the
[1:14:22] kids be kids.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? I'm not saying
[1:14:27] don't correct them. I'm saying it's our
[1:14:29] job to correct them and invest in them
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; if you don't have them.
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; It's a scary thought.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; You see, we don't have very long with
[1:14:41] our children. Brother Caleb and I
[1:14:44] spent some time before church. I believe
[1:14:47] it was today, tonight, this morning
[1:14:50] talking about this subject. And I said,
[1:14:52] I'm g some of this was already in my
[1:14:54] notes. All was already in my notes. I've
[1:14:56] told you tonight, but we were standing
[1:14:58] back there and he brought it up to me
[1:14:59] how he want to do something for the
[1:15:00] kids.
[1:15:02] And I had this in my notes. Who will who
[1:15:05] will invest
[1:15:08] what they can do?
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; Brother Caleb said it and I have it
[1:15:13] right here in my notes. You got a brief
[1:15:15] moment of time.
[1:15:17] don't have very long.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; A few of the ones we started with five
[1:15:23] years ago are already getting up in
[1:15:24] their teenage years.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; And they were the little ones
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; where are we going to church?
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; Look, in in in a blink of an eye,
[1:15:35] there'll be a youth group.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; And they'll grow up and they'll get
[1:15:39] married.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; How much time do we have? while they're
[1:15:43] young and tender. This is what David
[1:15:44] understood about Solomon. While he's
[1:15:46] young and tender, I'm going to prepare.
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; I'm going to do what needs to be done.
[1:15:50] I'm going to work. It's a lot of work.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; But I'm going to do it
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; while he's young.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; Because that's not very long. Listen to
[1:16:01] Paul in 1 Corinthians chapter nine. He
[1:16:04] talks to the Corinthians. He said, "If I
[1:16:05] be not an apostle unto others, yet
[1:16:07] doubtless I am to you. For the seal of
[1:16:10] mine apostilhip are ye in the Lord."
[1:16:12] What does that mean? It means that it
[1:16:14] means that Paul
[1:16:17] was we could say a hard object,
[1:16:20] right? He he had there was something
[1:16:22] about it. His character could cut an
[1:16:24] image
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; in impressionable things.
[1:16:30] And the seal is made of wax which is
[1:16:32] impressionable. And Paul said, "My
[1:16:34] ministry in my life," if you go read the
[1:16:36] rest of the of the chapter, "My ministry
[1:16:38] in my life is to you. it. I I put a seal
[1:16:41] in you.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; But no matter how hard you press, if you
[1:16:44] press down against iron, it won't make
[1:16:45] an imprint. That's
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; But if you press down against clay,
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; if you press down against wax, there
[1:16:52] will be a seal. He said, "And you are
[1:16:54] the evidence, the seal,
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; that the the way I carried myself, the
[1:16:59] way I conducted myself, it it made a
[1:17:01] difference to you.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; It changed you." Oh, church. Yeah. Uh if
[1:17:06] you could just realize older folks and
[1:17:07] elders, if we could just realize how we
[1:17:09] carry ourselves, whether we come to
[1:17:10] church or not, whether we praise God or
[1:17:12] not, whether we whether we lift our
[1:17:14] voices in praise, whether we sing along
[1:17:16] with the songs, whether we You say,
[1:17:18] "Well, I don't feel like it, but it's
[1:17:19] about time we got past our feelings and
[1:17:21] said, "Lord, help me to help the next
[1:17:23] generation. Help me to build the the
[1:17:25] house of God. If I can't build it, let
[1:17:27] me make some nails
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; for the generation that will."
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; Very good.
[1:17:34] While they were young and tender, Paul
[1:17:37] made such an impression by the gospel.
[1:17:40] He said, "You're my seal, the seal of my
[1:17:43] apostilhip.
[1:17:44] I pray, oh God, let my character be such
[1:17:48] that it'll make an impression."
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; Cuz there'll be an impression there.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; They'll carry an impression of what they
[1:17:57] experienced while they were young. Come
[1:17:58] on.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; Many of you
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; carry the impression of times when you
[1:18:03] were in church
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; and people did wrong.
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; You carry the impression of times I mean
[1:18:09] from years ago.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; Maybe maybe you were you were in church
[1:18:14] and people fought and fussed
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; carried on in the name of religion in
[1:18:18] the name of the message
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; fought with one another made an
[1:18:23] impression on you where you didn't want
[1:18:24] fellowship anymore.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; Right? Come on.
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; I don't want our kids to be like that.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; I want them to be able to fellowship
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; without borders and without boundaries.
[1:18:33] I want them to be able to love God. I
[1:18:35] don't want them to be afraid every time
[1:18:37] they hear a preacher that they're going
[1:18:38] to be deceived. But I want them to be
[1:18:39] able to receive the word and receive it
[1:18:41] in a tender heart.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; While they're tender and young, come on
[1:18:45] church, I'm I'm done preaching. But
[1:18:46] while they're tender and young, let's
[1:18:48] make an impression on our young people.
[1:18:50] Let's do what it takes to make an
[1:18:52] impression. Amen.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; Now is the time to press. Musicians as
[1:18:57] you come. Now is the time to press to do
[1:18:59] the work to make preparations
[1:19:01] cuz somebody that's younger is going to
[1:19:04] be the house of God. If the Lord
[1:19:06] carries,
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; they're going to be the church. This
[1:19:09] building won't be the church. We don't
[1:19:10] want to get too tied to this building
[1:19:12] because this building is not the church.
[1:19:13] But the people are the church. And
[1:19:15] listen to me. Someday that this building
[1:19:17] will pass away. But if the Lord carries,
[1:19:20] there'll be a church.
[1:19:22] Come on.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; And the difference we make now, the
[1:19:25] preparation we make now will what
[1:19:28] whatever preparation we make is how
[1:19:30] glorious we believe the building will
[1:19:32] be.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; David said, "Because the building,
[1:19:39] my God's house,
[1:19:42] I want it to be great."
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; I want it to be magnificent. Yeah.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; He said, "Because of that, my my son saw
[1:19:51] him and he's young. He's tender. So,
[1:19:54] I'll make preparation.
[1:19:56] I'll keep him in the house of God.
[1:19:59] While they're young and tender, I I'll
[1:20:01] make time for them. Shake their hand.
[1:20:02] Spend time with them. Do something for
[1:20:05] them. Help them out a little bit. Come
[1:20:08] on, church. I know we spend a lot of
[1:20:09] times we preach to the young people, but
[1:20:11] I'm preaching at the old people for the
[1:20:13] young people.
[1:20:15] I put myself in there with you old
[1:20:17] people. Oh God, may we make an
[1:20:20] impression on our children. May we not
[1:20:23] may we not go another generation where
[1:20:25] the children just drift out of church.
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; And people watch them drift away and
[1:20:29] never never call out and say, "What? Can
[1:20:31] I give you a hand?
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; Can I help you back in?"
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; Can I show you the mercy of God? Can I
[1:20:38] show you the grace of God? Say, "God,
[1:20:40] help us today." I know there's several
[1:20:42] young people here today and a few of our
[1:20:43] elders and some are gone, some are
[1:20:45] missing. But I just for different
[1:20:47] reasons, but I if you're hearing it, if
[1:20:49] you're watching it today, now is the
[1:20:51] time to press. This is the time. If
[1:20:53] they're going to be the seal of what
[1:20:55] you've done, if they're going to be the
[1:20:56] seal of your ministry, of what you are,
[1:20:58] if they're if you're going to make an
[1:21:00] impression on them, now is the time to
[1:21:01] press down.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; Now's the time to take that seal that
[1:21:05] you've got, that token you have, and
[1:21:06] press and make an impression
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; on our young people.
[1:21:11] God help me. We bow our heads together.
[1:21:15] [Music]
[1:21:18] Appreciate you bearing with I was very
[1:21:20] tired today and coming through strep
[1:21:23] this week and I I don't want to complain
[1:21:25] to you but it just we had such a
[1:21:27] wonderful meeting and the devil just
[1:21:28] attacked my body and just sometimes you
[1:21:31] get weak and tired and but God let me
[1:21:34] make an impression.
[1:21:38] [Music]
[1:21:41] Let me make a difference.
[1:21:44] Think you've heard many times, but that
[1:21:46] man who was getting stranded starfish on
[1:21:49] the edge of the ocean and he picked one
[1:21:51] up and threw it back and picked another
[1:21:53] one up and threw it back and someone
[1:21:54] come to him and said said, "What
[1:21:56] difference can you make? There's
[1:21:58] millions of those out here. Every time
[1:22:00] the waves come up, it washes another one
[1:22:02] up." He said, "It made a difference to
[1:22:03] that one.
[1:22:05] Maybe we can make a difference to those
[1:22:06] that are here. Make a difference to
[1:22:09] those that we have for just a moment.
[1:22:11] we hold in our hand like sand. We have
[1:22:14] influence on them like like holding a a
[1:22:18] fist full of sand if you're at the beach
[1:22:20] and it just slowly leaves
[1:22:25] and suddenly you don't have any anymore.
[1:22:28] You just have the residue.
[1:22:31] It's the way childhood is. It's the way
[1:22:33] being a young person is. It's just
[1:22:35] fleeting and
[1:22:37] it's over. Just a moment to make an
[1:22:40] impression.
[1:22:43] What do you want that impression to be?
[1:22:45] Oh, I tried to talk to them one time and
[1:22:46] they wouldn't listen.
[1:22:50] I needed help, but they were too busy.
[1:22:58] The only thing I remember about that
[1:22:59] person is they yelled at me. God, help
[1:23:01] us not to be that way.
[1:23:05] [Music]
[1:23:06] I love our church. I love how loving you
[1:23:08] are and how patient you are with our
[1:23:10] children,
[1:23:12] but we want to preach these things now
[1:23:14] so we hold a defense and a guard and we
[1:23:16] don't want to ever become hard and
[1:23:18] bitter and oh, we did things better in
[1:23:21] our day. Well, we may have, but let's
[1:23:22] teach our children to do things better
[1:23:24] than we did.
[1:23:27] God would help us today.
[1:23:31] Hallelujah.
[1:23:32] I believe his presence is here. If you
[1:23:34] need to talk to him for a minute, why
[1:23:35] don't you just do that while you're
[1:23:36] sitting in your seat? I know it's been a
[1:23:38] long day, but
[1:23:41] Lord Jesus, forgive me.
[1:23:45] I want to make an impression. Lord,
[1:23:53] I feel like my wife and I never fuss,
[1:23:55] but if we ever do, there's somebody
[1:23:57] overhears it.
[1:24:00] Oh, God.
[1:24:06] I don't want my children to take what
[1:24:13] [Music]
[1:24:15] your dad's all about work. You don't
[1:24:16] have time for me to tell him I got a
[1:24:19] problem. And if I did tell him, he'd
[1:24:21] blow up at me anyway.
[1:24:24] God help us, church.
[1:24:28] God help me. I I just want to talk to
[1:24:31] him and Lord forgive me. Help me. Help
[1:24:33] me to be a real father. Help me to be a
[1:24:35] real pastor. Would you make that your
[1:24:36] prayer? Whatever your your occupation
[1:24:38] is, your job is, your position is in
[1:24:40] your home. Help me to be a real mother,
[1:24:42] grandmother. Help me to be have an make
[1:24:44] an impression on my kids.
[1:24:47] Oh Lord Jesus, I love you tonight.
[1:24:51] God, I pray you'd forgive me. Lord,
[1:24:54] help me to be like Paul. I could say
[1:24:56] that the people that I preach to become
[1:24:58] the seal of of a of of my ministry. I
[1:25:01] pray you'd grant it, Lord.
[1:25:04] Not the sermons that I would preach or
[1:25:06] the amount of people that would come to
[1:25:08] church,
[1:25:09] but the lives of the people. I pray you
[1:25:12] grant it, God. Forgive me, Lord.
[1:25:15] Lord, if I if I've not taken the time
[1:25:16] that I should take
[1:25:19] where people become afraid and they say,
[1:25:21] "Well, I don't want to talk to him. He's
[1:25:22] scary. God, help me. I don't want to be
[1:25:24] like that." I pray, Lord, that you'd
[1:25:27] help us to be gentle with those we need
[1:25:29] to be gentle with. To speak the truth in
[1:25:31] love, not to drive the sheep so hard
[1:25:35] that we kill the young people.
[1:25:37] Pray you grant it, Lord.
[1:25:40] Help us, Lord. Help us to be gentle.
[1:25:43] Help us to be loving. Help us, Lord,
[1:25:45] when the time comes, Lord, if little
[1:25:46] Junior's going over the cliff and we
[1:25:48] need to we need to yell. But Lord, may
[1:25:50] we yell so infrequently that when we do
[1:25:53] raise our voice, it would make a
[1:25:55] difference cuz they knew it was serious.
[1:25:58] I pray you granted, Lord,
[1:26:01] thank you for all that you've done.
[1:26:02] Lord, we love you today. We thank you
[1:26:04] for your presence. Thank you for these
[1:26:05] testimonies. We've heard of your
[1:26:07] goodness to us. We love you and we thank
[1:26:09] you for it. Jesus name. make us better
[1:26:12] parents, better preachers, better
[1:26:14] pastors, whatever it is that we are.
[1:26:16] Pray you'd help us now in Jesus name.
[1:26:19] Amen.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh,
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; could you sing it now with all your
[1:26:24] heart?
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; All my words fall short.
[1:26:32] Oh yes, I've got nothing new.
[1:26:38] Oh, thank you, Lord. How could I
[1:26:41] express?
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; Oh, I thank you, Lord Jesus.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; All my gratitude.
[1:26:48] Sing it now.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; I could sing this song.
[1:26:56] I'll thank you, Lord, as I ought to do.
[1:27:01] Every song must
[1:27:04] every song must sing.
[1:27:08] Oh, but you never do.
[1:27:12] Oh, let's stand and sing it now. Oh, so
[1:27:16] I'll throw up my hands
[1:27:19] and praise you again and again.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; Cuz all that I have is a hallelujah.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; And I know it's not much, but I nothing
[1:27:44] else fit for a king

[1:28:06] Hallelujah.
[1:28:08] Oh, thank you, Lord. I've got one
[1:28:12] response.
[1:28:16] I've got just one move. Oh, can you
[1:28:20] stretch your arms out to him now with my
[1:28:23] arms stretched wide?
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, I will worship you.
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Oh, so I'll throw up my
[1:28:36] hands. I'll praise you again.

[1:28:58] And I know it's not much. I'm nothing
[1:29:03] else for him.

[1:29:33] shine on me. Lift up your song.

[1:29:43] So get up and praise. Oh
[1:29:48] glory. Oh, thank you Lord. Oh come on my
[1:29:53] soul. Oh, don't you get shout on me.
[1:29:58] Lift up your soul. Oh, you got a lion
[1:30:04] inside of those.
[1:30:06] Why don't you get up and praise the
[1:30:10] Lord?
[1:30:13] Everybody now. Oh, so I throw up my
[1:30:17] hands
[1:30:18] and praise you again and again.

[1:30:33] Oh,
[1:30:35] [Music]
[1:30:39] and I know it's not much, but I'm
[1:30:43] nothing else big for a king.
[1:30:48] Oh, except for our singing hallelujah.
[1:30:53] [Music]
[1:30:58] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:31:03] [Music]
[1:31:05] Let's give him a hand of praise tonight.
[1:31:07] You love him. Oh, we love you, Lord
[1:31:09] Jesus.
[1:31:12] Hallelujah.
[1:31:15] Some of you didn't get to see, but I
[1:31:18] Uh, Sister Fritz came this morning and
[1:31:21] just really blessed me. I didn't notice
[1:31:24] it during church cuz I don't see so well
[1:31:26] when I take my glasses off, but Sister
[1:31:28] Fritz was sitting back there. And last
[1:31:31] week at the meeting, she was prayed for
[1:31:33] on Sunday morning. Brother Daryl Ward
[1:31:35] took the time to go by and lay his hands
[1:31:38] on her and pray for her. And when he
[1:31:39] prayed for her, she didn't ask him, but
[1:31:41] prayed for that she would be able to go
[1:31:42] without oxygen. And that's a burden to
[1:31:45] her to carry that around. If you notice
[1:31:47] this morning, Sister Fritz didn't have
[1:31:48] any oxygen.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; Now, I know she did that by faith. I
[1:31:58] know my our sisters, she just said,
[1:32:00] "Well, I've been prayed for."
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; What if we all took that kind of
[1:32:04] attitude?
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; I've been prayed for.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; We heard the testimony of Brother
[1:32:09] Harvey, Sister Vicky give a testimony of
[1:32:11] being able to walk in things and do
[1:32:13] things she weren't able to do before and
[1:32:14] different ones. Uh we we've had more
[1:32:18] than a dozen testimonies from our own
[1:32:19] church of God's healing power. He's
[1:32:21] still God.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; Why don't we believe him like that? We
[1:32:25] believe in church today. And I know I've
[1:32:27] it's been a little heavy today. I've
[1:32:28] skinned you a little bit and especially
[1:32:30] us older folk. And you know, giving us
[1:32:33] things to think about, but these are
[1:32:35] things I've been thinking about. I
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; I just
[1:32:39] God help us to take our responsibility
[1:32:41] seriously.

[1:33:19] Lord, it was on my heart just to pray a
[1:33:22] prayer of thanksgiving for what you've
[1:33:23] done. What you've done for brother
[1:33:25] Harvey and what you've done for Sister
[1:33:27] Fritz and different ones, Sister Lana,
[1:33:30] Sister Willow. Lord, different ones that
[1:33:32] you've helped and healed.
[1:33:34] God, that they put their testimonies.
[1:33:36] Lord, we thank you. Well, this testimony
[1:33:38] we gave during the meeting of the baby
[1:33:40] that was born when the doctor said there
[1:33:41] was no way. But Lord, you are our way.
[1:33:45] Said when there was no way, you'd make a
[1:33:47] way for us. You've done it. We thank you
[1:33:50] for that, Lord. Lord, I know that you've
[1:33:52] done that for this church as a group, as
