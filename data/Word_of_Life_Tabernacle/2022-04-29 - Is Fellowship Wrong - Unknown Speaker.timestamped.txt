[0:01] now
[0:02] saul identified himself with samuel he
[0:05] says i'm with the prophet
[0:08] and he took a yoke of oxen and hewd him
[0:10] in pieces and and said whosoever cometh
[0:13] not forth after saul and after samuel
[0:16] and the fear of the lord fell on the
[0:17] people on brother branham as we read
[0:19] said the people came out of fear of
[0:20] samuel
[0:21] many men have went out preaching
[0:24] using brother branham's name to get the
[0:26] people to follow them
[0:29] yes sir right because of some
[0:30] association they had with him when he
[0:31] was alive they did it when he was alive
[0:34] sure right
[0:36] brother branham tells how difficult the
[0:37] ministry was because others wanted to
[0:39] use his name to draw crowds and he said
[0:41] this way he said many times they fixed
[0:42] an auditorium
[0:44] advertising the paper i'm the bee said i
[0:46] don't even know nothing about it and
[0:48] then the people begin to call me and say
[0:50] well brother branham you're advertising
[0:51] the paper he said oh that hurts me
[0:54] oh that hurts me he tells a story about
[0:55] a lady in pennsylvania that went off and
[0:58] she decided that she was going to hold a
[1:00] meeting and so what she did she
[1:02] advertised brother branham would be
[1:03] there the first night the people showed
[1:05] up and he wasn't there and she preached
[1:07] and the second night and uh he he said
[1:10] she called everybody the second day said
[1:11] well i know whether brandon wasn't here
[1:12] last night but he's on his way
[1:15] and the people all got there and she
[1:17] preached
[1:20] and brother branham you imagine how that
[1:23] would hurt him and he hears about it
[1:24] he never agreed to go
[1:27] but she was just using his name
[1:30] but today we do that with quotes
[1:34] taken out of context
[1:37] to associate ourselves with a prophet
[1:40] and that's the only semblance of what
[1:42] what he was saying when he said it that
[1:45] even exists anymore it's just that it
[1:47] got brother branham's name attached to
[1:48] it because we've used it completely
[1:51] opposite any way brother branham would
[1:52] have ever used it yeah right that's
[1:54] right
[1:56] are you with me i know it's a little bit
[1:57] different but
[1:59] the lord's been moving but i believe
[2:00] these things we grounded and settled you
[2:02] know
[2:03] and then the lord that's when the lord
[2:05] moves you put things in order and things
[2:07] are right and and i just
[2:09] sunday just thrilled my heart and the
[2:11] last sunday as well god's moving let's
[2:13] let's make sure that that we're right
[2:15] where we need to be at the time that god
[2:17] moves
[2:21] now
[2:22] now people use quotes
[2:25] and then disfellowship people who
[2:27] disagree with their version
[2:30] of what the prophet said me and samuel
[2:32] yeah
[2:35] personal vendettas against them call
[2:37] them balaam
[2:39] motivating the people to a spiritual
[2:41] battle by fear
[2:43] and the people many times and i i i
[2:46] don't know whether to be amused or to be
[2:49] saddened and mostly saddened
[2:51] but i see young preachers especially
[2:53] under these systems
[2:55] that and they'll come out and say well
[2:58] uh well you know uh they'll preach this
[3:00] about bel pior about going up and
[3:02] fellowship with other message churches
[3:06] yeah and i just this is just an example
[3:08] of what's done but it's done in many
[3:10] places
[3:12] and in many ways
[3:14] but well if you're if you fellowship
[3:16] with insert name of the person you hate
[3:19] you're going to the feast of bel pior
[3:22] i can't stand that because i've been
[3:23] told that so many times
[3:25] as i said i've been around
[3:29] right
[3:30] well if you fellowship with this this
[3:32] certain group whatever it is
[3:34] you're going to the feast of bell people
[3:35] or you're like balaam
[3:37] brother branham said
[3:41] we used quotes to say i'm with brother
[3:42] branham but i challenge you because i
[3:44] looked at almost every one of them this
[3:45] week
[3:47] every time brother brandon i believe he
[3:48] talks about bail 306 times if i'm not
[3:51] mistaken
[3:52] and i looked at every one of them this
[3:53] week to look and see i can't find a
[3:55] place where brother branham says
[3:57] used that in relation to fellowship with
[4:00] local churches
[4:02] or between pastors
[4:05] who believe in the opening of the word
[4:08] you remember and again it's just an
[4:10] example but we don't we don't need to
[4:12] follow this
[4:14] we don't need to follow it and you say
[4:16] well brother ben what should we do
[4:17] should we separate no
[4:20] he said somebody's calling me a balaam
[4:21] because i got
[4:22] preachers that do that with me
[4:25] and he called me a balaam because i
[4:27] fellowship with different people you
[4:28] know what you can call me that i'll go
[4:30] fellowship with you
[4:34] amen am i balaam for coming to your
[4:36] meeting
[4:40] and i actually would encourage that
[4:42] because the people don't understand they
[4:44] sit there and think well it's the first
[4:45] time i've ever heard it i've heard every
[4:47] preacher every backslidden preacher that
[4:50] lost confidence in the word to hold the
[4:52] people uses the same argument
[4:55] everybody else is wrong
[4:58] that's right i don't know there's a lot
[4:59] of wrong out there i know what's right
[5:03] and whether you get it from me or from
[5:04] somebody else this is right yes sir
[5:07] that's right that's right
[5:08] and there are people who literally are
[5:10] afraid to come to meetings at our church
[5:11] because the pastor somewhere and i don't
[5:13] say it's a local pastor but there's
[5:15] pastors out there who will say
[5:17] that it's the feast of el pio you're
[5:19] going up to fellowship with balaam and
[5:21] his bunch
[5:22] and brother branham never uses it in
[5:24] that context
[5:25] go look it up
[5:28] now
[5:28] moab didn't have a brass serpent
[5:31] they had no atonement we believe the
[5:33] message
[5:35] we're preaching from the same scripture
[5:36] believing the message now if you go up
[5:38] and fellowship with someone who has no
[5:40] atonement
[5:41] and brother branham said the foolish
[5:43] virgin you remember
[5:44] had rejected the atonement of the hour
[5:46] the fullness of the atonement and that's
[5:48] why they had to go through the
[5:49] tribulation period now you can go be a
[5:51] light i'll go sometimes these southern
[5:53] gospel concerts and baptist people and
[5:55] you feel the spirit of the lord
[5:56] sometimes in those places you raise your
[5:58] hand and worship with them and and all
[6:00] be there together but you don't have
[6:01] much in common
[6:03] that's right right there's just not much
[6:05] there but but with message people and
[6:08] i'm not talking about about strange
[6:10] ideas and nonsense i've separated from
[6:12] things like that before and i'm not
[6:14] afraid to do it again but i'm talking
[6:16] about people who believe the opening of
[6:17] the word
[6:18] people who believe like we do but
[6:20] they're a little bit different in the
[6:21] manner of worship or different but
[6:22] random had i think four churches in his
[6:24] own hometown
[6:26] who disagreed with him on church order
[6:29] and brother branham put it this way he
[6:31] said if every one of the people in this
[6:32] church went to those churches he said
[6:34] we'd just fill it up again praise god
[6:38] sure i don't have i honestly i don't
[6:40] have an itch to preach a huge crowd and
[6:43] we may we might have a huge condo i'm
[6:44] nothing against it either it is easier
[6:50] to preach to a bunch of people
[6:52] i know these people were hoping i'd get
[6:53] well these preachers on a wednesday
[6:55] night but didn't brother stewart do a
[6:56] good job last wednesday night preaching
[6:58] to us amen brother joel on sunday night
[7:01] as well
[7:03] i feel like i could go take a month's
[7:05] vacation i'd be all right
[7:09] but uh but what what is it what did moah
[7:11] have or what did they not have
[7:14] that israel had here's what brother
[7:15] branham said was the difference
[7:17] he said what was the difference
[7:18] fundamentally both right he said but
[7:20] moab did not have the vindication of god
[7:22] with them
[7:23] they were only a nation a group of
[7:25] celebrities but israel had a prophet
[7:27] with them
[7:29] i would put it this way they had the
[7:31] prophet
[7:33] right which is the messenger of the age
[7:35] balaam was a prophet
[7:38] israel had a prophet listen they had a
[7:39] smitten rock
[7:41] they had a pillar of fire they had a
[7:44] brass serpent for healing they had the
[7:46] blessings of god moving right along with
[7:47] them and they was the called out
[7:49] children of god
[7:51] now just imagine with me for a moment
[7:53] because brother branham never identifies
[7:56] going to the feast of bel pior as being
[7:59] uh the difference between moab and and
[8:02] israel as being totally moral morality
[8:06] they were the same yes
[8:08] they both had a mixed multitude
[8:11] some that lived in some didn't
[8:13] right
[8:14] right
[8:15] and you got to be careful about
[8:16] separating from people because we said
[8:18] well they've had things happen and and
[8:20] there's been there's been problems in
[8:22] their church and and so we're holy you
[8:24] know nothing ever happens to us well
[8:25] nothing that you hear about
[8:28] right and if you can imagine a moabite
[8:31] going down into the camp of israel and
[8:32] being there on the day that aaron builds
[8:34] a golden calf
[8:36] they happen to go to church on the day
[8:38] that aaron decides to build a golden
[8:39] calf because because moses is gone half
[8:41] the people end up getting swallowed up
[8:43] that day
[8:45] the music was terrible
[8:48] playing a bunch of rock and roll music
[8:49] around a golden calf you would you could
[8:52] be excused if you were a moabite
[8:54] going out there and looking at all that
[8:56] and saying these people aren't god's
[8:57] people
[8:58] but the random said they saw men that
[9:00] married other men's wives they saw all
[9:02] the immorality of israel because they
[9:04] looked at the hundred parts of israel
[9:06] and balaam said surely god will curse
[9:08] them and god wouldn't even let him yeah
[9:11] so he invited him up to a feast and said
[9:12] we're all the same
[9:14] and we're not all the same because we
[9:16] have a prophet
[9:17] we have a smitten rock
[9:19] we have a brass serpent
[9:21] he said they had a brass serpent for
[9:22] healing they had the blessings of god
[9:24] moving right along with them they were
[9:26] the called out children of god
[9:29] but remember it was not moses that
[9:31] wasn't brotherly to moab
[9:33] it was moab who said don't you can't
[9:35] pass all right
[9:39] moab is denomination every time brother
[9:41] branham types it to that yeah and the
[9:43] feast of belle fiore he said it's the
[9:45] ecumenical move and they called him up
[9:47] and he said you pentecostals are going
[9:48] right along with it
[9:50] the people that used to laugh at you and
[9:51] make fun of you
[9:53] right like balaam did
[9:55] but they but now they become the
[9:56] economical move and brother brandon
[9:57] standing there preaching right to the
[9:59] group
[10:00] we explained it a few weeks ago a few
[10:01] months ago that become that ecumenical
[10:03] move that become the charismatic
[10:04] movement ended up wedded with the
[10:06] catholics
[10:08] today where there's no difference
[10:11] right that was the balaam move
[10:15] that's what he called it i don't say
[10:17] there couldn't be some people anointed
[10:18] with the same spirit today even around
[10:21] the message
[10:22] but the call to not fellowship was to
[10:24] call to come out of denominationalism
[10:26] come out of her my people be not
[10:28] partaker of her plagues
[10:30] not because somebody uses different
[10:32] music than you do
[10:33] yeah somebody has drums and you don't
[10:37] or somebody preaches a little bit longer
[10:39] than you like
[10:41] that's called sovereignty local church
[10:43] sovereignty yeah that's right we used to
[10:47] laugh at people who wouldn't come to our
[10:48] churches because we had a fellowship
[10:49] hall or christmas trees
[10:52] but now i see people doing the same
[10:53] thing about music
[10:55] or about how many emotions are in the
[10:57] service or some minor doctrine yeah amen
[11:02] but you say it's a good cause the people
[11:05] did you see the people they were dancing
[11:06] in front of a golden camp but they were
[11:08] god's people
[11:10] some of them were anyway
[11:14] be careful talking about god's people
[11:17] it's a good cause so assaults but a
[11:20] prophet said he was deceitful
[11:22] and it showed he never broke that
[11:24] denominational curse yes because his
[11:27] methods were still denominational
[11:30] i've been told that if we fellowship
[11:32] with others other churches locally that
[11:34] we're as guilty as they are whatever
[11:36] they do we're guilty of it
[11:38] well i know
[11:39] guilt by association but i think you
[11:41] carried it a little bit too far
[11:44] that was balaam's argument by the way
[11:47] again did you hear the music down at the
[11:48] golden calf their high priest made a
[11:50] golden calf what if a moabite saw that
[11:53] surely god will curse them i tell you
[11:55] what people need to repent of the
[11:56] critical spirit
[11:58] if guilt by association was the rule
[12:00] brother randall was as guilty as the
[12:02] modern charismatic movement
[12:04] because of the full gospel businessmen
[12:06] who were funding him and also funding
[12:08] the modern charismatic movement at the
[12:10] same time
[12:12] you could point out i won't name names
[12:13] tonight but you can point out people
[12:14] around brother branham's inner circle
[12:16] that we would look at today and say you
[12:18] need to disassociate yourself with them
[12:21] and brother branham let them be used by
[12:23] god to get the message out
[12:26] that's right
[12:29] guilt by association that's nonsense
[12:31] preach the word
[12:35] i'm not going to tell you where you can
[12:36] can't go to church i'll encourage you to
[12:38] go to meetings there's some meetings i
[12:40] may not encourage you to go to but you
[12:42] know what you're you're the bride of
[12:43] christ
[12:46] you can't be deceived
[12:48] you can't fall
[12:51] i hate to believe that or i don't
[12:53] god told moses you got angry you didn't
[12:54] believe me
[12:56] when i said speak to the rock you you
[12:59] hollered at the people
[13:00] yeah you didn't believe me
[13:02] oh god help us to believe that we
[13:04] believe him today see we'll never get
[13:06] this thing done by human effort that's
[13:08] right we're never by the efforts of a
[13:10] pastor guarding the people telling them
[13:12] where they can and can't go to a meeting
[13:14] where they can and can't go to church
[13:15] what car to buy that human effort is
[13:17] never going to get people in a rapture
[13:20] it's never going to get people where
[13:22] they need to be with god i've watched it
[13:24] over the years and the more human effort
[13:26] the pastor puts into it it seems like
[13:28] the farther the people get away from god
[13:30] because they learn to hide things and
[13:32] keep it away but if the preacher will
[13:33] just preach the word and let it fall
[13:35] where it may
[13:36] if the preacher will preach the gospel
[13:38] what happens is the people that are gods
[13:40] begin to live by and the mixed multitude
[13:43] goes on and does their thing
[13:45] but there's got to be somebody that's
[13:46] going to live it somebody that's going
[13:48] to go in the rapture might as well be us
[13:50] tonight there's got to be somebody
[13:52] that'll worship god there may be many
[13:54] who do it wrong
[13:55] there may be many to get the music wrong
[13:57] and and the dancing wrong and the and
[14:00] the shouting wrong and everything else
[14:01] but it don't stop me from shouting when
[14:03] it's time to shout
[14:05] when it's appropriate it don't stop me
[14:07] from worshiping god when it's
[14:08] appropriate it don't stop me from
[14:10] fellowshipping with my brothers
[14:16] i believe i'm supposed to believe in an
[14:18] open book the opening of the word and i
[14:19] can't even fellowship with people who
[14:20] believe literally the same thing
[14:26] god doesn't put his
[14:27] his church in the hands of men who
[14:30] manhandle it
[14:32] the virgin bride
[14:36] oh i wish you could hear my heart
[14:37] tonight
[14:40] the word have such a respect for the
[14:42] word
[14:42] i hope you see that the word is so great
[14:44] i wish i could preach it like i want to
[14:49] but the benefit nikkei nikkeil means to
[14:51] conquer
[14:52] leo means the laity nicolette means to
[14:55] conquer the laity
[14:56] he said now why is this such a terrible
[14:58] thing it's terrible because god has
[15:00] never
[15:01] someone say never
[15:03] he has never placed his church in the
[15:05] hands of an elected leadership which
[15:08] moves with political
[15:10] mindedness we're going to schedule
[15:12] something on the same day so the people
[15:14] can't go yeah
[15:16] sure
[15:20] he's placed his church
[15:22] in the care of god ordained
[15:24] spirit-filled god help me today word
[15:27] living men who lead the people through
[15:29] feeding them
[15:30] the word that's right
[15:32] saul drove cattle
[15:36] but david
[15:37] fed sheep yes
[15:39] you know why she follow the shepherd
[15:40] brother joe it's because he leads him to
[15:42] green pastures right he leads him beside
[15:45] the still waters so they learn to trust
[15:47] him yeah and yes sometimes he's got to
[15:49] go after one sometimes he's got to break
[15:51] a leg but it's his love for them he's
[15:53] not behind them driving them he's in
[15:56] front of them
[15:59] oh that the ministers of the message of
[16:01] the hour could be in front of the people
[16:03] not behind them but doing it first yes
[16:07] let us be the ones who do it if
[16:08] somebody's going to live it let me live
[16:10] it if somebody's going to go to portray
[16:13] the
[16:14] love and joy and peace let me not just
[16:15] preach about it but let me do it lord
[16:18] let me manifest it
