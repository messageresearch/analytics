you may be seated this afternoon Mr Allison comes to sing her song I didn't get to know Sister Gene as a young person and to see her walk and you know live her life but being able to stand here sometimes and sing to her and to preach to her and after service going out she grabbed your hand and if she held on to it I think that meant she liked it and uh maybe if she didn't she didn't like it but she couldn't tell you the bad things but you know it always seemed like she was happy to be here she enjoyed going to church and so my wife had the privilege of helping her out a little bit there at the house and uh one day sister Gene as we known her here made a cake and I think she made it for some friends and uh my wife was over there helping her out and she sent the cake home with my wife and for us to eat because she said that she didn't want Robert coming home knowing she was up baking and I didn't want to get in trouble by Robert you couldn't keep her down she always wanted to be up and doing things and now she can without any limitations are we thankful for that that we have a promise that we'll get to see her again [Music] I love you Lord for your mercy never fails me all my days have been held in your hands from the moment that I wake up up until I lay my head oh I will sing of the goodness of God [Music] all my life you've been faithful all my life you've been so so good with every breath that I may born oh I will sing of the goodness of God I love your voice led me through the fire in darkest nights you are close like no other I've known you as a father oh I've known you I have a friend and I have lived in the goodness of God all my life you have been faithful all my life you've been so so good Lord with every breath that I'm able oh I will see of the goodness of God oh I will see of the goodness of God [Music] I want to thank you for the goodness of God in the bad times what it would seem he's always been good and he's faithful you have a promise of being somewhere with him and we're thankful for that's why we're here today to celebrate a life and we know where she's at aren't you thankful for that start over the course [Music] the throne throw the glasses [Music] yes we'll join our love poor Brown price forever oh this is this is just what heaven is key oh a country [Applause] [Music] day foreign [Music] last last night before

happens and we sing that course again oh and what will it be [Music] enjoy the throng upon the glasses [Music] forever oh this is just what happened means to me what a privilege it's been over the last couple of years to be sister Jean's pastor and I people touch your lives in different ways and sister Gene touched Mine by just being here and wanting to be here and it was very difficult for her in her situation in her body but she wanted to serve the Lord and and she did and we're grateful for that I'm grateful for the example that she set and for the times we got to spend together in her home she was always a Believer she believed the Lord was going to heal her and he has so we believe he has today One Way Or Another We're a winner either way and so we're grateful for that thank you for coming today I want to read to you out of John chapter 14 and down verses one through three and just kind of talk about sister Gene and and the word and some of the things these are things that we believe as I said this morning we believe that the Bible is the foundation for all of our Doctrine all of our practice and we believe that the Bible teaches that we're going to see our sister again in and so we don't sorrow like as others who have no hope but we believe that we'll see her and what what a promise that that is let's look at John 14 and 1 let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe also in me in my father's house or many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there you may be also I didn't know Sister Gene as a young woman I met her her body had already been broken by that awful disease of Parkinson's but I know that she always wanted her home to be nice in fact brother Robert told me a story about how that when she was younger and the kids when they were children said they would come in out of the house and the kids always had to take their shoes off before they come in the house and if she didn't she'd come after him with a broom and that's the kind of woman that she was I always knew that my sister-in-law told me she said I've never cleaned the house like that said that's the cleanest house that I've ever cleaned and and because she would still try to be up and doing and sneaking around like brother Joel told the story of her baking the cake that's the way that she was she wanted to be up and doing and and she wanted her home to be nice and but there wasn't anything she could do about her body Satan did that it's just the world that we live in in this broken world but she wanted to be well she wanted to have be able to do the things she wanted to work in the kitchen and and be a part and help and she wanted her home to be more than just a place she lived she wanted a home and I think she fulfilled the scripture of Titus 2 when it speaks of of a woman and and what the ideal is and what a mother should be a homemaker says the aged women likewise that they be in behaviors becometh Holiness not false accusers not given to much wine teachers of good things teaching the young women to be sober and to love their husbands and to love their children to be discreet chaste keepers at home and what that means keepers at home it means a homemaker a homemaker the world that we live in today has made that some kind of a of a a bad word almost and and I know that my wife sometimes has told people I'm a homemaker and and people kind of look down on that I believe sister Jean was almost always in her life a homemaker I think that's a wonderful thing what a great job that she had as a homemaker a keeper at a home and I think there's something about a woman who believes the Bible like sister Jean did that she wanted to have a home and she wanted to be a homemaker I believe that she fulfilled also of the scripture of a virtuous woman I won't take the time to read it all this afternoon but in Proverbs 31 27 it said she looketh well to the ways of her household that's a good definition of a homemaker she looketh well to the ways of her household eateth not the bread of idleness her children to rise up and call her blessed and her husband also when he prayseth her many daughters have done virtuously but thou excellus them all favor is deceitful and beauty is vain if you watch the pictures you knew the sister Jean was a beautiful woman as a young lady and as she got older her beauty remained but her body began to get old and show her age but but favor is deceitful beauty is vain but a woman that fears the Lord shall be praised and I believe she was the woman that feared the Lord give her the fruit of her hands let her own works praise her in the gates she's a homemaker Jesus spoke in the scripture that we read in John 14 2 he said in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I'd go to prepare a place for you as much as sister Gene wanted the place to be nice that she lived in well Robert I believe that the Lord Jesus wanted a nice place for her to live not just a house but a body a place that she could live in something that she could have hands that would work and feet that would work I believe she has that today now that word house is not just a it's not a big house with many smaller houses within it it's actually household and it's not brick and mortar but it speaks of the family and mansions are Dwelling Places we could read it like this and my father's household there are many Dwelling Places or many kinds of Dwelling Places I don't believe that when we get to heaven that everybody will look just exactly alike I don't believe that we'll all be blondes or brunettes or little or big or all Giants even though some of us might wish for that and some of us might wish to be smaller but there's many kinds of Dwelling Places many many different kinds of bodies and God is a god of variety you can see that in the world that we live in he's got big mountains and little mountains he's got Plains he's got deserts he's got different things because he made it the way he wanted it he made season summer winter spring and Autumn although it seems like summer just Blends into the next summer anymore around here but yet he made the seasons he made a variety of of people he made some that are real blusterous some are dogmatic others are are fine some are kind and you just find all kinds of different people in his kingdom and this life then is only a preview of one to come and you look at someone in a hospital or on a sick bed or as I would go to Sister Jean's house and or she would come here to the church and see the condition that she was in and you see that but yet there's a there's a desire there to live they want to live they want to be well and all of us have that but what it tells you is there's somewhere where we can be well there's somewhere where we can live and I think about that he said I go to prepare a place for you and I've often wondered about that because how does he know but he knows me better than I know myself and so he knows what kind of a house that I want to live in what kind of a world that I would want to live in and he makes it just for me so that when I get there it'll be perfect and the world that she's in now she wouldn't trade this for that at all but the world that she's in now is so much better than the one that she left it's so much better than the one that we're left in When You See It someone's struggling like that it speaks that there's a better place there's a place where there is no struggle there's a place where there is no Parkinson's disease there's a place aren't you glad for that today there's a place where there are no there are no diseases and there are no there are no politics and there are no there are no economic struggles there's a place that he has prepared for you prepared that place for sister Gene at the graveside when we laid her away we we read this scripture in second Corinthians chapter 5. Paul says for we know how do we know because we're believers we know that if our Earthly house that he calls this body a house of this Tabernacle were dissolved we have not we will have but we have a building of God a house not made with hands eternal in the heavens we used to think that when we left here we just went to a place where our Spirits floated like clouds and we couldn't shake one another's hands but brother Branham taught us that we have a building of God and he went beyond the curtain of time and had the vision and saw the people that were there they were real people with real bodies not just a holding place somewhere but somewhere that's perfect and it's beyond perfect not Sublime is the way he described it but beyond Sublime you can't think of any words in the vocabulary to say it you've just arrived her house is already finished and I believe it's clean she will never have to toil to do that again you see God had a picture he had a picture of you perfect picture of sister Gene in a perfect condition what he wanted her to be and maybe some of you can remember you've been around a while in in her life and in her family you can remember what she was like as a young lady we could look at the pictures and see what she was but he had a picture of what he wanted her to be and he put that in his family album if we could say it that way he put it away and he had that in his mind whatever God had in his mind is going to happen he tells us he said I know the thoughts that I have towards you thoughts of peace and not of evil to bring an unexpected end so he had that in his mind and being the all-powerful omniscience omniscient providential God that he is he he prepared away he said I go to prepare a place for you so that you can be in that body you can be in that condition and so she already had that image of what God wanted her to be that body was waiting for her the moment that she took her last breath and we might wonder I know brother Roberts wondered we've talked about it why did she have to suffer while she was here well she was preparing her character for that house somehow God just knew that the trials and the tests and the things of life would prepare her for that place in Romans 8 15 it says you have not received the spirit of bondage to fear but have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children than heirs Heirs of God and Joint heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with them that we may be also glorified together for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature waited for the manifestation of the sons of God for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hopes in other words we didn't put ourselves in our bodies we didn't pick Our Lives she didn't pick having to suffer and having to go through some of the things that she went through in her life she didn't choose that but God allowed her to go through that and he did it because he wanted to reveal himself in her and I think we caught a glimpse of Heaven in the life of sister Gene and now she finally gets to grab a hold of the reality of that and to live to live I I can't imagine the joy that she's going through right now what what she what she is putting up with right now is all joy not about the bondage of a body that won't work right now look he said the creature was made subject to vanity because the creature verse 21 also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the Glorious Liberty of the children of God we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the Redemption of our body I want to be in my new home how many of you could agree with me today that's where we want to be we are here waiting on our change she's had she has hers I want to leave you with these words these Paul says behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised Incorruptible and we shall be changed first Thessalonians 4 15 it goes on to say for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent let's hinder them which are asleep for the Lord himself showed the sin from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord he said wherefore Comfort one another with these words I don't think I could put it any better than what the scripture does brother Robert while we were going through the the process of of sister Gene as she began to begin to look like she was about to pass away I he sent me this quote and someone had sent it to him and he asked me to read it and I think it fits so well right here brother Brandon said so it brings Joy to the heart of the waiter that's waiting on the coming of the Lord and the Blessed hour that when these Old Vile bodies shall be changed and made like unto his own glorious body and we shall see him no more struggle no more sorrow no more old age no more infinite days when I read that brother Robert I thought well maybe maybe brother Branham put that wrong he he might not have understood or he might have meant to say something else but actually when you're sick when you're in trouble when you you just as you get older the days get longer and longer don't they he said there'd be no more infinite days no more days that never end no more hunger no more worry no more sickness no more death oh we just can't fathom it I'm telling you friend it's hard because we're human and death is such a thing that will all hate to face it but it's a blessed relief it's a blessed thing to know he'll come someday and these things will be changed I my mother is still living I can't imagine what it's like with Robert to lose a mother but I know she's in a better place that doesn't change how much you'll miss her doesn't change the whole that will be left in the home and and the companionship that was there that's not anymore but it's just a little while just a little while life the Bible tells us is like a vapor it appears for a while and it's gone some of you that are older know that that's true you you've lived and you look back and say where did the years go we only have a little time if we could give any advice today on what to do with that time first of all give your heart to Christ live for him believe his word love one another use the time wisely if you knew this was going to be your last day what would you do with it I know Sister Gene used some of her last days to come to church and to try to reach out for healing which she received she was ready for her new home and that's all that one could be asked she was ready because of the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ in her life if you're not ready today he is the way he goes on to say I am the way the truth and the life ask him to make his home in you we bow our heads together we can't honor the life of someone like sister Jean in an hour or two hours or five but we're trying to do our best to present to you that we believe she's in a better place and if you have never accepted Christ as your savior you could do that today and we pray that there will be comfort for the family and strength that you'll be able to make it through until we see her again Heavenly Father Lord I Thank you for these that have come and they they wanted to be here to honor sister Gene Lord they were there for her in some way through her life and we're thankful for that [Music] but God I pray that you'd help them to know that they'll see her again or maybe there would be one that wouldn't be just exactly where they should be with you I pray you would help them to make things right and and live for you so that they can be there we thank you for the life of sister Gene I I think of brother Robert and what a blessing he is to the church and how much he'll miss her Lord I pray your comforting hand on his life Lord that peace would cover every moment Lord every day there'll be moments when he misses her and he'll begin to think oh I don't know what I'm going to do I I need mother to talk to I need I need her to be there she always listened I pray during that moment Lord that you'd fill in with the peace that passes all understanding Lord I pray you would help each and every one we want most of all to be there we thank you for the life of our sister and we pray Lord that we'd be counted worthy Lord to be Lord where she is at one day Lord we thank you for the release from sickness from these things Lord that tormented her in this flesh and we thank you for the knowledge that she's in a better place a home that's been prepared for her that is perfect Beyond any understanding of men Lord we thank you for that Comfort the family Lord we pray for each one that's come that you'd bless them and we pray and we ask it in Jesus name amen the Lord let's stand together if you would I believe where she's at she's happy so we'll end this service on a happy note that where she is now she's singing and she's rejoicing and she may be running all over the place for all we know but when we get there brother Robert when you see her face I believe you can run to her and she can run back to you with no limitations isn't that going to be a wonderful day what a day of rejoicing that will be amen are you looking forward to that day oh sing the wondrous love of Jesus sing his mercy and his grace in the Mansions bright and blessed he'll prepare for us a place oh when we all get to him Heaven what a day of rejoicing that will be oh when we all see Jesus Jesus Will Sing and Shout the victory and while we walk the pilgrim pathway well over spread the sky but
