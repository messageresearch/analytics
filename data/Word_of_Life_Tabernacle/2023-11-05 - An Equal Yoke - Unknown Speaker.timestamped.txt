[43:29] when I try to do something like this but
[43:30] just pray for me that I can bring this
[43:32] in a way that you can understand what
[43:35] we're trying to tell you and know that
[43:36] we're not taking it out none of this
[43:39] stuff are we taking out on anybody in
[43:42] particular it's just a few things we'll
[43:44] start with uh the list that was made and
[43:48] uh this is concerning the the younger
[43:50] kids or the older kids either whoever
[43:54] whoever it may concern or you you'll
[43:56] know who you are uh we have we have a
[43:59] lot of small children we don't have as
[44:01] many as we had before because a lot of
[44:03] them have M moved past the coloring
[44:06] books and everything else and they're up
[44:09] here on the front row and we're proud of
[44:11] them yes the other thing is we got some
[44:15] when people we got I know some of you
[44:18] got your favorite chair and your
[44:20] favorite blanket because sometimes it's
[44:22] not so warm in here and sometimes you
[44:25] get a little uncomfortable so if you got
[44:28] those things in here that's fine only
[44:31] thing we asked that and the there's some
[44:34] uh younger kids have to have their
[44:35] coloring books and stuff like that we
[44:37] just ask that you try to reverence the
[44:39] house of God and be quiet and at the end
[44:42] of the service if you would there's a
[44:44] book case in the in the nursery back
[44:47] there if you would take your stuff that
[44:50] you leave here try to leave here uh back
[44:54] there so it's not in the church CU it
[44:56] makes it it makes it a lot easier on the
[44:59] people that try to clean the church if
[45:01] the stuff is not everywhere and we just
[45:04] ask you to put it in a place if you got
[45:07] blankets fold them up if you want to
[45:08] leave them in your chair except on a
[45:11] special occasion if you want to leave
[45:13] them fold them up neatly and put them in
[45:15] your seat that's fine too or your Bibles
[45:18] or stuff just leave them in a neat
[45:20] fashion and because what happens is when
[45:23] we have people we got we have usually
[45:26] several visitors every service and they
[45:28] come in here and they see people stuff
[45:31] in the seats and everywhere else they
[45:33] then they get to wondering where they're
[45:36] going to sit and if someone's not re
[45:38] right by to help them then that's a
[45:39] problem but it it don't it's not a
[45:42] problem it's just something we need to
[45:44] watch and uh the children after
[45:48] Services uh there's some running in and
[45:51] out uh and we just ask you to uh
[45:55] reverence the sanctuary of God brother
[45:57] brandom told us about those things that
[46:00] how we could run the service for the
[46:02] next few times by a kid running in and
[46:04] out of the church or something and and
[46:07] uh I I was raised back in the day when
[46:10] brother Brown said first said these
[46:12] things and some of them was maybe taken
[46:15] over a little over seriously or whatever
[46:17] but when when I was a young kid if you
[46:21] if you moved into church you better have
[46:22] a good reason for it if you wasn't
[46:24] sitting still so
[46:27] and we're not telling you that you can't
[46:28] come in here and and move or I'm not
[46:31] saying that I'm just saying things have
[46:32] changed over the years we've growed up
[46:35] spiritually and naturally also
[46:38] so
[46:41] uh one thing we had we had some people
[46:45] people get into the sanctuary even over
[46:47] in the fellowship hall and kids we've
[46:49] had some kids almost just run them down
[46:52] not not meaning to but they bump into
[46:55] them and when you get a little old your
[46:57] balance is not as good as it used to be
[46:59] we've had a few we've had incident with
[47:02] some people just fell around here but
[47:04] not to do with the kids but we're just
[47:06] asking you to watch your children and
[47:08] don't let them run in and out especially
[47:10] in the sanctuary we ask you when the
[47:13] service is over here at uh when we
[47:17] dismiss leave quietly and get from the
[47:20] sanctuary out to the foyer and if you
[47:23] can just move move on out of that forer
[47:26] what we have is everybody that forer is
[47:28] not real big and everybody gets right in
[47:30] the door and then the people that's left
[47:32] in here can't get out of the service and
[47:35] sometimes we've got people that's in
[47:37] here after the service the musicians are
[47:39] still playing and there's people
[47:41] worshiping just sitting in their seats
[47:43] worshiping we'd like for you to just go
[47:45] on out so we can shut those doors and
[47:48] keep the racket down from there to hear
[47:50] and and watch how loud you get back
[47:52] there until you make it outside and then
[47:54] we don't care how loud you are want you
[47:55] get out the doors but but just try to
[47:58] watch that a little bit uh you know if
[48:02] Deacon makes say if you got a if we got
[48:04] a kid here that runs in and out all the
[48:06] time we may ask him if you you know talk
[48:09] to him and see if we can help him to cut
[48:11] his trip down a little bit but we're not
[48:14] not here to ball anybody out and we're
[48:17] not here to hurt anybody's feelings for
[48:20] sure and we just got these things that
[48:23] we got to take care of over in the
[48:24] fellowship hall
[48:27] uh especially around the drink table at
[48:30] lunch when we have lunch over there if
[48:32] you will help us watch your children and
[48:34] other grown-ups can watch other children
[48:36] too we got a lot of the kids like to
[48:39] play with those cups and straws and
[48:42] coffee filters but or not coffee filters
[48:45] coffee stirs and stuff but uh we've had
[48:49] the kids like to use them for toys and
[48:52] they they cost quite a bit of money to
[48:53] go buy that stuff so and we're not
[48:56] asking you not to use the coffee stirs
[48:58] but just let's just be careful watch
[49:00] your children let's try not to waste
[49:02] stuff and after we leave out of that out
[49:05] of there and after a service if you
[49:07] would just each and one every one do
[49:11] your part let's try to pick up the trash
[49:13] and don't leave it for somebody else to
[49:15] do when you're it's not real bad but
[49:18] sometimes it becomes a a trashy looking
[49:21] stuff somebody has to pick all that
[49:22] stuff up so we like to keep it looking
[49:26] nice so and some of you bigger some of
[49:30] your bigger children some of you
[49:32] professional Rock throwers we have a
[49:34] little bit of a problem around here the
[49:36] other day before the Fall Festival we
[49:39] got to cleaning up in the church yard
[49:41] out here is full of those big old rocks
[49:44] and I don't know if we was trying to see
[49:46] who could throw the biggest one the
[49:47] furthest but the guy that does the lawn
[49:50] mour is not real proud of you when he
[49:52] comes out here to mow the grass so we
[49:55] like i' like to ask you to please if you
[49:57] got to throw rocks wait till you get
[49:59] home or
[50:01] somewhere don't don't be doing it here
[50:04] because it causes a problem out there
[50:07] and a after the service is over and
[50:09] people get ready to go home ask you to
[50:12] this is for everybody watch your watch
[50:15] the kids out here somebody if somebody's
[50:18] leaving the church kind of watch watch
[50:20] for them too cuz this is a small area
[50:23] out there and we don't want anybody
[50:24] getting run over
[50:26] and it it can happen we've had it we've
[50:28] seen it happen before and heard
[50:30] incidents that didn't turn luckily I've
[50:32] never been around one it was a serious
[50:34] problem but I've seen some kids have
[50:37] some close calls because if you're
[50:39] backing out of there when you get a
[50:40] little older your neck don't turn just
[50:42] quite as far as it used to and you start
[50:47] backing out of there and know some of
[50:48] these kids don't stick up high enough
[50:50] you can't see them so let's just
[50:52] everybody work together on that and then
[50:55] another thing is this intersection out
[50:58] here where you pull out on this road I
[51:00] ask you when you're coming to church or
[51:02] when you're leaving church be be very
[51:04] very careful out there cuz there's been
[51:06] some close calls there a time or two so
[51:09] that's a that's a bad place because you
[51:11] can't see it for a long ways from any
[51:13] direction and we do have people there's
[51:15] a place right up here the road that
[51:18] people some of them people coming out of
[51:20] there just can't drive real good because
[51:22] of the shape they're in when they leave
[51:23] there so watch out for them you I know
[51:27] that
[51:28] uh I've had I've had a close call out
[51:31] there myself real
[51:33] close the guy came around that curve
[51:36] behind and I was looking in my rearview
[51:38] mirror and I was just about ready to see
[51:40] if I couldn't just go on down the road
[51:42] and he finally got almost off in the
[51:44] ditch and kept from hitting me but just
[51:48] keep these things in your mind I know
[51:50] that that's not we didn't come to church
[51:52] to hear this stuff this morning but uh
[51:55] uh I think that pretty much covers the
[51:58] bulk of it the main thing I want you to
[52:01] know that little kids and big kids the
[52:04] deacons here this church love
[52:06] you and we're here we're here to serve
[52:09] you if you ever need anything that we
[52:11] can do for you to help you please don't
[52:14] hesitate to let us know what it is if
[52:15] you got any questions about anything
[52:17] that's going on here that's fine too
[52:20] just ask us if we can't answer it we'll
[52:22] find someone that can for you that's
[52:25] that's about takes care of

[1:02:04] I appreciated
[1:02:07] the uh word from Brother Danny this
[1:02:09] morning the things that he said I uh I
[1:02:12] appreciate the deacons doing their job
[1:02:14] and whether it's my family or myself I I
[1:02:17] know I need to be reminded every now and
[1:02:19] then of what to do and and how to act in
[1:02:21] the house of the Lord but I what I
[1:02:23] appreciate is so much was how he
[1:02:25] reiterated his love and the love that
[1:02:27] the deacons have for the people here in
[1:02:29] the church and you need to hear that
[1:02:31] sometimes and our families need to hear
[1:02:33] that from us we love you and you need to
[1:02:35] hear that from your pastor you need to
[1:02:37] hear that from the deacons we love you
[1:02:38] that's why we do what we do our deacons
[1:02:40] aren't paid they don't get any kind of a
[1:02:43] financial uh benefit from doing what
[1:02:46] they do but they've given their lives to
[1:02:48] the gospel I appreciate that you
[1:02:50] appreciate our deacons let's give them a
[1:02:52] hand this
[1:02:53] morning
[1:02:57] I really appreciate that it makes my job
[1:02:59] that much easier to preach to you and
[1:03:01] and talk to you this morning Matthew
[1:03:03] 11:28 we appreciate the spirit of the
[1:03:05] Lord Brother joshu is going to preach
[1:03:07] for us this afternoon so we're looking
[1:03:09] forward to
[1:03:12] that 3
[1:03:14] o00 Matthew 11:28 come unto me all all
[1:03:18] ye that labor and are heavy
[1:03:21] laden I will give you rest
[1:03:25] take my yoke upon you he says take my
[1:03:28] yoke upon you and learn of me but for I
[1:03:32] am meek and lowly in heart and you shall
[1:03:35] find rest unto your
[1:03:38] souls for my yoke is easy and my burden
[1:03:42] is light now I want to also turn to 2
[1:03:45] Corinthians
[1:03:49] 6:14 2 Corinthians 6:14 be ye not
[1:03:52] unequally yolked together with
[1:03:56] unbelievers for what Fellowship hath
[1:03:59] righteousness with
[1:04:01] unrighteousness what communion hath
[1:04:03] light with Darkness what Concord hath
[1:04:06] Christ with bile what part hath he that
[1:04:08] believeth with an Infidel what agreement
[1:04:11] hath the temple of God with Idols for
[1:04:13] you are the Temple of the Living God as
[1:04:15] God has said I will dwell in them and
[1:04:18] walk in them and I will be their God and
[1:04:21] they shall be my people I pray Lord
[1:04:24] would add his Blessing to the reading of
[1:04:25] the word you may be seated this
[1:04:29] morning the word yoke it's y ke we had a
[1:04:34] little error this morning on the stream
[1:04:36] it said y l k so I'm not preaching about
[1:04:38] eggs this
[1:04:40] morning the word yoke can denote a type
[1:04:44] of wooden device uh used to in different
[1:04:47] parts of the world to harness animals
[1:04:50] that have been bred and trained to pull
[1:04:53] heavy loads no known as draft animals
[1:04:55] and uh the a draft animal or uh maybe an
[1:05:00] ox would be maybe the the thing that
[1:05:02] they would use the most actually pulls
[1:05:04] the strongest or the hardest load and Ox
[1:05:07] would be something that uh you use to
[1:05:09] break ground with to pull a very a very
[1:05:12] heavy load with and a yoke would look
[1:05:15] something like this and so a yoke is
[1:05:18] something that uh you you put you when
[1:05:21] you have a Yol when you're yolked with
[1:05:23] something means you're pulling the same
[1:05:25] direction it means that uh you're moving
[1:05:28] you're doing the same thing you you
[1:05:30] can't get out of a yoke it it is what it
[1:05:33] is you're you're stuck there with
[1:05:35] whatever uh other uh type of animal that
[1:05:38] they would be yolked with now uh being
[1:05:40] yolked with someone means that when you
[1:05:42] move they move when uh when they move
[1:05:45] you move you you do nothing outside of
[1:05:48] of each other and and so it was very
[1:05:51] important that yolked animals were of a
[1:05:54] a similar size a similar strength and
[1:05:57] even similar temperament right because
[1:06:00] you don't want an animal that's going to
[1:06:02] be real flighty and jump real quickly to
[1:06:05] be put there with an ox you wouldn't
[1:06:06] want a a thoroughbred horse to be yed up
[1:06:10] with an ox because they've got
[1:06:11] completely different temperaments so
[1:06:14] they even even they'll raise animals
[1:06:16] together and they'll actually bring them
[1:06:18] up as uh as pears they'll get two little
[1:06:21] milk cows and and they'll make ears out
[1:06:24] of them and they'll bring them up
[1:06:26] together they'll raise them together and
[1:06:29] actually they don't make cow tears out
[1:06:30] of the cows I know Joel I you all know
[1:06:33] what I'm talking about they take two
[1:06:36] Cals and they make steers out of the
[1:06:39] calvs and they raise them together and
[1:06:41] when they're raised together what
[1:06:42] happens is aren't you glad to enjoy the
[1:06:44] house of the Lord this morning what
[1:06:46] happens is they get to where they move
[1:06:48] together right and they live together
[1:06:51] and they eat together and everything
[1:06:53] that they do is together together well I
[1:06:54] think that's the way we ought to be in
[1:06:56] the house of God I think that's the way
[1:06:57] we ought to be with one another it's the
[1:06:59] way especially in our marriages and
[1:07:01] different things that we do we ought to
[1:07:02] do things together and most of all we
[1:07:05] should do things with Christ yes sir so
[1:07:08] you find that yolked animals so they've
[1:07:11] got to be raised together and and even
[1:07:13] if you have yolked animals that pull
[1:07:15] together a pair of ox and say that pull
[1:07:18] together for a long time when one of
[1:07:20] them dies they don't put another Ox with
[1:07:22] the other one they actually retire him
[1:07:25] and the reason is because he's learned
[1:07:27] to pull with that particular animal it'
[1:07:29] be very difficult for him to learn a
[1:07:31] different kind of animal right and in
[1:07:34] the Old Testament uh it was actually
[1:07:37] Moses told the people he said don't he
[1:07:39] said don't yoke a donkey and and an ox
[1:07:43] together now that's an odd pairing isn't
[1:07:46] it you know some things you you
[1:07:48] shouldn't even have to say it but but
[1:07:50] they did say it nanny it's good to see
[1:07:52] you back there this morning God bless
[1:07:54] you my uh my wife's great grandmother's
[1:07:57] here this morning good to see you this
[1:07:58] morning let's give her a
[1:08:00] hand it's been a while since I've seen
[1:08:03] her but when you when you yoke if you
[1:08:06] take a donkey and yoke that with a with
[1:08:09] a ox what would happen is you'd have a
[1:08:13] little donkey that's flighty and scared
[1:08:16] and weak and the ox is going to be
[1:08:18] pulling the load plus the
[1:08:20] donkey right right see you don't want so
[1:08:24] to be yolked if you're a person that has
[1:08:26] the temperament of an
[1:08:28] ox you don't want to be yolked with the
[1:08:30] temperament of a donkey that's right
[1:08:33] right because you're going to be doing
[1:08:34] two completely different things now the
[1:08:36] donkey has his purpose and the Yoke has
[1:08:39] his purpose but you don't want to yoke
[1:08:40] them or or the the ox has their purpose
[1:08:43] but you don't want to yoke them together
[1:08:45] right now I'm going to take the most
[1:08:47] obvious application of this this morning
[1:08:49] which is in marriage and then we're
[1:08:51] going to move on to uh uh maybe some
[1:08:53] something spiritual because this isn't
[1:08:56] the point of the sermon this morning is
[1:08:57] not a uh marriage counseling or anything
[1:09:00] like that but I guess if the shoe fits
[1:09:02] we have to wear it but it would be as I
[1:09:05] said very difficult to plow with animals
[1:09:07] of different kinds it's very difficult
[1:09:10] for people of different Natures
[1:09:13] especially a Believer and an unbeliever
[1:09:15] to be married right right because when
[1:09:17] you're married you're more tightly
[1:09:19] yolked with someone than in any other
[1:09:22] relationship in your life
[1:09:25] you can even get away from your
[1:09:28] kids when they get older I promise you
[1:09:31] there'll be come a day brother Spirit
[1:09:33] you'll be able to get away from your
[1:09:34] children there is that that's coming but
[1:09:37] you won't ever get to that place with
[1:09:39] your wife I think brother Joel told me
[1:09:41] that one guy said he'd found the uh the
[1:09:44] secret to a happy life he said he and
[1:09:46] his wife he said they they go out on
[1:09:48] dates twice a week he goes out on
[1:09:50] Wednesday and she goes out on
[1:09:52] Thursday but but it's not really
[1:09:55] possible to do that it's not really how
[1:09:57] it works because you're yolked together
[1:10:01] for for richer or poor how many said
[1:10:03] that when you got married for richer or
[1:10:06] poorer in sickness and in health for
[1:10:09] good or for bad and whatever happens
[1:10:11] till death do us part so that's the
[1:10:15] promise that we make now in Matthew 193
[1:10:18] Jesus the Pharisees come to Jesus and
[1:10:20] they begin to talk to him and they
[1:10:22] tempted him and said to him is it lawful
[1:10:24] for a man to put away his wife for every
[1:10:27] cause in other words just whenever he
[1:10:29] wants to yeah verse four and he answered
[1:10:32] and said unto them have you not read
[1:10:34] that he which made them at the beginning
[1:10:35] made them male and female and said for
[1:10:38] this cause shall a man leave father and
[1:10:40] mother and shall cleave to his wife and
[1:10:43] they twain shall be one flesh wherefore
[1:10:47] they are no more Twain but one flesh
[1:10:50] what therefore God ha joined together
[1:10:52] let not man put a
[1:10:54] if God has joined you and your wife
[1:10:56] together it is not possible for man to
[1:10:59] put that
[1:11:00] aunder oh I think we ought to believe
[1:11:02] marriage is for life when you're
[1:11:04] unequally yolked in marriage it causes
[1:11:08] both parties to suffer now just like the
[1:11:12] ox with the donkey the ox would rather
[1:11:15] not have to drag the donkey along right
[1:11:17] and the donkey would rather not have to
[1:11:19] be dragged Along by the ox and so
[1:11:22] there's constant uh ition in the home
[1:11:25] that's right because there's an unequal
[1:11:28] yoke right so we and and no matter what
[1:11:30] we do it doesn't just apply to marriage
[1:11:32] it applies to business relationships it
[1:11:34] applies to churches you you can't be
[1:11:36] unequally yolked you need to go to
[1:11:38] church where there's something you can
[1:11:39] believe in there something you can have
[1:11:41] confidence in something a place where
[1:11:43] you can worship freely you need to go to
[1:11:45] that kind of a church and I'll say this
[1:11:47] if that's not here you need to find
[1:11:49] someplace where you can go to the house
[1:11:50] of God and worship God the way that the
[1:11:53] the way that God moves through you and
[1:11:55] and to do that and and so you need to
[1:11:57] find a place where you can be yolked
[1:11:59] together and you can work together for
[1:12:01] the same thing amen so we don't want to
[1:12:04] make other people suffer so I will say
[1:12:07] this to our our young people and
[1:12:09] children you want to marry a Christian
[1:12:11] because you don't want to make your
[1:12:13] spouse your future spouse
[1:12:16] suffer and it will actually be a point
[1:12:19] of suffering with your future spouse if
[1:12:21] they are an unbeliever and you're a
[1:12:23] believer there will be a a a suffering
[1:12:25] there because they don't want to do what
[1:12:27] you're what you want to do there there's
[1:12:29] no agreement when it comes to the most
[1:12:31] important thing which is Christ now
[1:12:34] brother brand talks about that he said
[1:12:36] you know there's still a good thing
[1:12:37] young man to think about or young woman
[1:12:39] now I'm going to add a little bit here
[1:12:41] and not not adding to what brother
[1:12:42] brandom said but just to what I would
[1:12:44] say about this this doesn't stop when
[1:12:46] you're
[1:12:47] young yeah just because you're older
[1:12:49] doesn't give you license to just go date
[1:12:51] or marry whoever you want to that's
[1:12:53] right because you're a widow or a
[1:12:54] widower and I know we have several here
[1:12:56] and I know none of you are looking and
[1:12:58] none of you are going to get married but
[1:12:59] just in case you
[1:13:01] were it it doesn't give you a license to
[1:13:03] go marry somebody outside of the faith
[1:13:06] just because you have some years on you
[1:13:08] brother BR says marry someone who is a
[1:13:10] Christian don't marry unbelievers yoke
[1:13:12] yourself not up among unbelievers Paul
[1:13:15] said for us not to do that the
[1:13:16] scriptures all through forbid us to yoke
[1:13:18] ourselves with unbelievers but I like
[1:13:20] this he said but if you're already yoked
[1:13:22] up with an unbeliever and he's willing
[1:13:23] to live with you or she in peace don't
[1:13:26] leave them just remain and live a
[1:13:28] Christian life that you might win your
[1:13:30] companion to Christ and I'll say if
[1:13:32] you're in that situation you might find
[1:13:34] yourself having to drag them to church
[1:13:36] sometimes or but but be careful with
[1:13:38] that you've got to work within the
[1:13:39] limitations of that person because
[1:13:42] they're not they don't have the same
[1:13:43] nature that you do and so you got to
[1:13:45] work within their limitations you can't
[1:13:47] just get angry with them you married
[1:13:49] them that way yeah right right so you
[1:13:51] have to work within if if they've got
[1:13:54] the nature right now of the world you
[1:13:56] got to not that you would be worldly
[1:13:57] yourself or be sinful yourself but you
[1:13:59] got to recognize that right let them be
[1:14:01] who they are but you be who you are be a
[1:14:04] real Christian be somebody who can be a
[1:14:06] light to everybody else around youl be
[1:14:09] somebody that can that can project such
[1:14:11] an overwhelming love that there's
[1:14:12] nothing they could do but love
[1:14:15] you if you're going to be a preacher be
[1:14:18] a preacher that everybody can see
[1:14:20] there's a real Christian they they may
[1:14:22] not be able to preach their way out of a
[1:14:23] wet paper bag but there's a real
[1:14:25] Christian if you're going to be a deacon
[1:14:27] be a deacon that people can say yes he's
[1:14:29] a deacon I don't always agree with what
[1:14:30] he says but there's a man of God there's
[1:14:33] somebody who lives it aren't you glad
[1:14:35] for that I could I could put names on
[1:14:37] that today if you're going to be a
[1:14:38] deacon be a Danny Ward be a harvey
[1:14:40] Savage be a be a Caleb San if you're
[1:14:42] going to be a preacher be a Joel prud or
[1:14:45] or if you're going to be a preacher be a
[1:14:47] Josh Martin if you're going to be a
[1:14:49] preacher be a steuart Duckworth be a man
[1:14:51] I believe these men live for what they
[1:14:52] preach
[1:14:54] be a man that'll live What You
[1:14:56] Preach be a a
[1:14:59] spouse that they can say there's a real
[1:15:02] Christian somewhere amen oh do you
[1:15:05] believe that today amen I might say this
[1:15:08] morning and I I'm going to get off
[1:15:09] marriage after a little bit I promise
[1:15:11] but let me just say this you say brother
[1:15:13] Ben my circumstances are
[1:15:15] different I know people carry a lot of
[1:15:17] baggage and all of our all of us have
[1:15:19] made mistakes yes even in the most
[1:15:21] important things in life doesn't mean
[1:15:23] you're going to hell I'll say this do
[1:15:26] you still love
[1:15:28] Jesus brother brand said if you still
[1:15:30] love Jesus you haven't gone too far yeah
[1:15:32] wonder you s something in your heart
[1:15:35] that reaches out for God just wants to
[1:15:37] you haven't gone too far you can still
[1:15:39] you can if you still have something in
[1:15:41] your heart that desires the things of
[1:15:43] God grab a hold of that just do do you
[1:15:45] said well I can't take that full step
[1:15:47] today take the partial step do what you
[1:15:49] can let God do the rest because when the
[1:15:53] the prodigal son was on his way home
[1:15:55] when he was a far off the Bible says
[1:15:57] brother the georan said last week when
[1:15:59] he was yet a far off the the father sees
[1:16:02] him a far off and he runs to him and he
[1:16:06] finds that he was not just a servant he
[1:16:08] would not be just a servant but he'd be
[1:16:10] given a robe and a and a ring and and
[1:16:12] get and the fatted calf would be killed
[1:16:14] for him because he was a son he was
[1:16:17] always a son he never stopped being a
[1:16:19] son are you with me so far this morning
[1:16:23] he said my circumstances are different
[1:16:25] brother BR said no believer should ever
[1:16:26] marry an unbeliever under no
[1:16:28] circumstances that always marry
[1:16:30] Believers yeah but it's not just
[1:16:32] marriage brother brandom talks about
[1:16:34] making a mistake we let our children
[1:16:35] play with little Oswald he calls him he
[1:16:38] said I don't mean to be a different now
[1:16:39] and starchy but some kind of fanatic he
[1:16:41] said but you be sure who your daughter
[1:16:42] goes out with at night time I don't want
[1:16:44] to embarrass my daughter tonight but I'm
[1:16:46] told I pick on Peter more than I do
[1:16:47] Esther I don't want to embarrass Esther
[1:16:50] this morning but uh you know when she
[1:16:52] was in when they were in public public
[1:16:53] school I I had to deal with a little
[1:16:55] situation where a boy was uh was working
[1:16:58] on trying to uh get into her life and
[1:17:01] and become a part of her life and I I
[1:17:02] was watching that relationship closely
[1:17:05] and uh we don't allow our children to
[1:17:07] date
[1:17:09] marry talk we allow them to talk but I
[1:17:12] mean I mean seriously as as a boyfriend
[1:17:14] or girlfriend with anyone that's not a
[1:17:16] Christian and you said what do you mean
[1:17:17] you don't allow them to I don't allow
[1:17:18] them go to bars either I don't allow
[1:17:21] them to drink I don't allow them to do
[1:17:22] drugs there some there just some
[1:17:24] standards you have to make and I'll say
[1:17:26] this it's not because we hate you it's
[1:17:28] because we love
[1:17:31] you we those boundaries are there
[1:17:33] because we love you what brother Danny
[1:17:35] was talking about this morning the
[1:17:36] reason we have these boundaries and
[1:17:38] these things we should do is because we
[1:17:39] love people not because we I hate people
[1:17:41] want to pick at them it's because we
[1:17:43] love you we want to see you I don't want
[1:17:45] to see one child in this church grow up
[1:17:47] and have to go out in the world and
[1:17:48] spend I I thank God for the testimonies
[1:17:50] we have of people that have been in the
[1:17:52] world and come back but I want something
[1:17:54] different for my children I want my
[1:17:55] children to not have the scars that I
[1:17:57] did I want them to be raised in the fear
[1:17:59] and admonition of the Lord you said but
[1:18:01] I haven't done right so far today the
[1:18:03] day to do right now's the time to make a
[1:18:06] decision I'm going to change my family
[1:18:08] history Hallelujah from this time and
[1:18:11] forever more I'm not going to let it be
[1:18:13] like it always was I'm not going to make
[1:18:14] the mistakes my parents made or my
[1:18:17] grandparents made I'm going to live
[1:18:18] differently sir because my kids deserve
[1:18:21] that the Next Generation if there is one
[1:18:23] deserves that yes amen right
[1:18:27] Hallelujah if you're not careful her
[1:18:29] life will come up ruin you don't know
[1:18:31] what he is and then he'll marry you and
[1:18:32] look where your kids are your
[1:18:34] grandchildren be careful God wants the
[1:18:36] people to be separated I was talking
[1:18:37] about my daughter watching that
[1:18:39] situation as a dad sometimes you have to
[1:18:41] just step
[1:18:42] in and we sometimes we we want our kids
[1:18:46] to be able to make the right decisions
[1:18:48] but our kids are also
[1:18:51] kids sometimes you just got to step in
[1:18:53] and say no that's not
[1:18:54] appropriate and she didn't do anything
[1:18:56] wrong in that situation but I was
[1:18:57] watching Satan trying to come in at an
[1:19:00] early age and over and I'm being honest
[1:19:02] about that and telling you about that
[1:19:03] today because don't you realize that
[1:19:06] Satan's working all the
[1:19:08] time he's working constantly try to come
[1:19:11] in and attack these children I've
[1:19:13] publicly said we're not going to lose
[1:19:14] one of them what do you think the
[1:19:16] devil's going to do about that you've
[1:19:18] had prayer at night you prayed you said
[1:19:20] Lord protect my children I'm going to
[1:19:22] make sure my children stay in church
[1:19:24] what do you think the devil's going to
[1:19:25] do immediately he's going to try to
[1:19:27] attack your family he's going to try to
[1:19:29] keep them out of the house of God but
[1:19:30] don't you realize that's when a a man of
[1:19:32] God a woman of God got to stand up and
[1:19:34] say not my family you don't have a right
[1:19:36] to my family yes sir amen amen
[1:19:40] hallelujah and but we do realize people
[1:19:42] make mistakes I'm glad this message is a
[1:19:44] message of
[1:19:45] Grace when it comes to marriage and
[1:19:47] divorce I know there people hate to hear
[1:19:48] that sermon but I I'm so grateful that
[1:19:51] it's a message of Grace amen because
[1:19:53] brother BR goes through all of that hard
[1:19:55] teaching about about the woman and the
[1:19:57] man and how what God intended and how
[1:19:59] Satan moved in and how it fell but then
[1:20:01] he goes to the very end of that he said
[1:20:03] so under the modern conditions he said I
[1:20:05] command you to go to your home with your
[1:20:07] wife now if you're happy with her live
[1:20:09] with her raise your children in the
[1:20:11] admonition of God what's brother randam
[1:20:13] concerned about not the past but the
[1:20:15] future and I think that's what we ought
[1:20:17] to be concerned about as a church I I
[1:20:19] we've all had a past we've all had
[1:20:21] something that we were but let's be
[1:20:23] concerned about the future he said if
[1:20:25] you're happy with or live with or raise
[1:20:27] your children in the admonition of God
[1:20:29] he said but God be merciful to you if
[1:20:31] you ever do that again now look he said
[1:20:34] you teach your children to never do a
[1:20:35] thing like that bring them up in the
[1:20:37] admonition of God he said and now that
[1:20:39] you are as you are let us go now at the
[1:20:41] late evening hour that we're living in
[1:20:43] and press toward the mark of the high
[1:20:45] calling in Christ how many can say Amen
[1:20:46] to that today I want to press on my past
[1:20:49] is my past I'm moving
[1:20:51] on am
[1:20:54] good where all things will be possible I
[1:20:57] believe that's where we live
[1:20:59] today I want to turn from Marriage for a
[1:21:01] moment and think spiritually
[1:21:04] now how could Christ now think deeply
[1:21:07] with me for just a
[1:21:09] moment how could Christ talk to me let's
[1:21:14] make it personal and say come unto me
[1:21:18] all you that labor and are heavy laden
[1:21:21] and I will give you rest
[1:21:23] take my yoke upon you now he's not
[1:21:27] saying that he's going to be the farmer
[1:21:31] and you're going to be the yolked
[1:21:32] servant and he's putting a yoke on you
[1:21:36] what's he saying come be yolked with me
[1:21:40] yes oh my come be yolked with me come
[1:21:46] take my yoke upon you verse 29 and learn
[1:21:49] of me so in other words we're going to
[1:21:51] walk this in we're going to plow
[1:21:53] together we're going to do life together
[1:21:56] we're going to walk through uh the
[1:21:58] things and the discouragements and the
[1:22:00] valleys aren't you glad to have somebody
[1:22:02] that's bigger than you and stronger than
[1:22:03] you that's able to walk with you through
[1:22:05] those times yes amen he said I want you
[1:22:08] to take my yoke upon you learn of me
[1:22:13] because I'm going to be walking beside
[1:22:14] you and I'm bigger than you are I'm a
[1:22:17] different nature than what you were born
[1:22:19] with so he said I want to teach you I
[1:22:21] want you to walk beside me I want to be
[1:22:24] right there with you for I am meek and
[1:22:26] lowly in heart you shall find rest unto
[1:22:30] your souls I think the problem many
[1:22:32] times is not being yolked to Christ that
[1:22:34] we're too little but that we're too
[1:22:37] big we are too big and too strong in our
[1:22:40] own self we think we're sufficient we're
[1:22:42] able to make it and he said come be
[1:22:43] yolked with me not because I'm bigger
[1:22:46] not because I'm stronger but because
[1:22:48] amen not because I'm some great thing
[1:22:50] but because I'm meek and lowly and heart
[1:22:53] yes come be yolked with me and you shall
[1:22:58] find rest unto your
[1:23:03] souls now again I want to ask us I know
[1:23:06] it's different this morning and it's
[1:23:08] quiet let's just think about these
[1:23:10] things now how will we sinful creatures
[1:23:15] be yolked with Christ the sinless
[1:23:19] one would not that be an unequal yoke
[1:23:22] what now think about it for a minute if
[1:23:25] he said take my yoke upon you and we
[1:23:27] were to walk up there an old donkey in
[1:23:31] our nature
[1:23:34] yeah and here's this great here's this
[1:23:37] here's Christ the altogether Lovely One
[1:23:39] the Bible says he's altogether lovely
[1:23:42] never did no sin never never did
[1:23:44] anything that was wrong how are we going
[1:23:46] to be yoked up to Christ oh my well he
[1:23:50] provided a way yes yeah now we we are
[1:23:52] called the bride of
[1:23:54] Christ we believe that today in
[1:23:57] Revelation 19:7 let us be glad and
[1:23:59] rejoice and give honor to him for the
[1:24:02] marriage of the Lamb has come his wife
[1:24:04] ha made herself ready we are his wife
[1:24:09] yeah and this is who he is look at this
[1:24:12] pairing today if you would with me for
[1:24:14] just a few moments we are paired with
[1:24:16] him we have been chosen by him yes and
[1:24:20] we are paired with him and if you look
[1:24:23] at this pairing it looks like an odd
[1:24:25] pairing because he chose Benjamin puit
[1:24:28] who did everything wrong to be married
[1:24:31] to Christ the word who did no sin
[1:24:34] hallelujah oh my this is who he is in 1
[1:24:37] Peter 2:22 he did no sin neither was
[1:24:41] guile found in his mouth yeah this is
[1:24:44] who we are in Psalms 51:5 behold I was
[1:24:47] shapen in iniquity in sin did my mother
[1:24:50] conceive me how are you going to get an
[1:24:52] equal yoke out of that yeah oh my come
[1:24:56] on listen brother BR says this he said
[1:24:59] God has come into man and God does
[1:25:02] nothing I'll think about this for a
[1:25:04] minute just say that with me God does
[1:25:07] nothing he does nothing apart from man
[1:25:11] yeah so everything that he does come on
[1:25:15] Oh my he Yoles himself come on with man
[1:25:19] amen so it's Jesus every time he want to
[1:25:22] work in the church on now amen he wants
[1:25:25] to yoke himself up with the pastor he
[1:25:27] wants to yoke himself up with the song
[1:25:29] leader he wants to yoke himself up with
[1:25:31] the musicians he wants to yoke himself
[1:25:33] up with the Sunday School teachers
[1:25:35] that's his purpose yeah is to be equally
[1:25:38] yoked with us amen you ever feel like
[1:25:41] you're getting dragged
[1:25:42] Along come on just think about
[1:25:47] it we can be honest today and take off
[1:25:49] our Halos as we heard last week and just
[1:25:51] real realize realiz that we are
[1:25:54] sinners we have been some of you were
[1:25:57] raised in church I know brother Josh was
[1:25:59] raised in church and I was raised in
[1:26:01] church brother Josh we were still
[1:26:04] Sinners maybe the worst kind because we
[1:26:06] were raised in church right under the
[1:26:09] message of the hour and so we had a
[1:26:11] religious spirit come
[1:26:14] on and so we we reached the point where
[1:26:17] we needed to be saved right because this
[1:26:20] yoke was this marriage was never going
[1:26:22] to work come on as long as we were who
[1:26:24] we were but God partners with man he
[1:26:27] made man his partner how could I be
[1:26:30] worthy of him how could I be his partner
[1:26:34] and watch brother brand said this is who
[1:26:36] he's looking for he's looking for
[1:26:38] character he said the character of
[1:26:41] Christ yeah he said that now just a
[1:26:43] moment now he said that's it he chooses
[1:26:44] a bride to reflect his character to
[1:26:48] which the modern churches of today
[1:26:50] certainly miss his program here A
[1:26:53] Million Miles cuz they deny this to be
[1:26:55] the truth they deny the Bible to be the
[1:26:58] truth he said how could it be he said
[1:27:00] now he's looking for the day for that
[1:27:02] bride to be formed Hebrews they may not
[1:27:04] deny the Bible in the state that it's in
[1:27:07] right here but they deny the Bible in
[1:27:09] the light of the word of the hour yeah
[1:27:11] right he said we're looking he's looking
[1:27:13] for the day for that bride to be formed
[1:27:14] Hebrews 13:8 he said just exactly like
[1:27:17] it was like he was it's got to be his
[1:27:20] same flesh the same B B Same Spirit same
[1:27:24] everything just exactly built up and
[1:27:27] them two become one right so we are
[1:27:31] actually to become one with Christ and
[1:27:34] then he said until the church becomes
[1:27:36] that they're not one the character of
[1:27:38] him the word for this age must be molded
[1:27:41] she must be molded like he is now again
[1:27:44] you look at that and realize how unequal
[1:27:46] that pairing would be something has to
[1:27:48] happen with us and to us to translate us
[1:27:51] from what we were to be somebody who
[1:27:53] could walk with Christ amen are you with
[1:27:56] me so far amen something has to take
[1:27:58] place yes now Christ has the ability to
[1:28:02] do something that we cannot do in our
[1:28:04] natural
[1:28:06] relationships you know why I it it's so
[1:28:09] hard when you marry an unbeliever
[1:28:11] because in your mind you think I can
[1:28:13] change that person right and the truth
[1:28:16] is you
[1:28:18] can't right and some of you that even
[1:28:21] marry a believer in Church you're like I
[1:28:23] don't like this but he won't do that
[1:28:24] after we get
[1:28:27] married some of you married people say
[1:28:29] oh
[1:28:31] no you know what happens in
[1:28:34] relationships is once you get married
[1:28:37] those proclivities usually get
[1:28:39] worse not
[1:28:41] better the things that a person does
[1:28:44] that annoy you are going going to get
[1:28:46] worse he's not going to get he's not
[1:28:48] going to snore
[1:28:51] less
[1:28:52] he's not going to be he's not going to
[1:28:54] you know if he's a if he's a guy that
[1:28:56] likes to tell jokes and you're a real
[1:28:58] serious person and you just can't handle
[1:29:00] the way you tell but I'm going to change
[1:29:02] him sorry you're just not going
[1:29:04] to it's actually going to get maybe get
[1:29:07] worse once he gets more comfortable
[1:29:09] because you're seeing the best side of
[1:29:10] him now right right he right now he
[1:29:13] always wears
[1:29:17] deodorant right now everything
[1:29:20] everything's wonderful right but you
[1:29:22] fixing to see some things once you get
[1:29:25] married so there's coming a time that
[1:29:28] you can't say well I'm going to change
[1:29:29] this person the same thing works
[1:29:30] spiritually you say well I know he he's
[1:29:32] really a Baptist right now but once we
[1:29:34] get married I I'll convince him that the
[1:29:36] message is right you'll never be able to
[1:29:37] do that because God has to change that
[1:29:40] person and I don't even believe we
[1:29:42] should try to do that just live the life
[1:29:45] don't argue the doctrine live the life
[1:29:48] anybody can argue Doctrine that's a cold
[1:29:50] formal powerless Church only weapon is
[1:29:53] argument our weapon is not argument
[1:29:55] we're not going to argue the world into
[1:29:56] believing that we're Christians but we
[1:29:58] got to live a life that the world will
[1:29:59] say there's a Christian there's a
[1:30:01] Christian there's somebody who really
[1:30:03] loves people there's somebody who really
[1:30:05] lives the message of the
[1:30:07] hour somebody's got to do that so we we
[1:30:11] can't argue them into into change yeah
[1:30:14] right but Christ is different from
[1:30:17] us because he can change us see there's
[1:30:21] two things that you can't do with your
[1:30:23] spouse you cannot Forno the choices that
[1:30:26] they will
[1:30:27] make and you cannot change who they are
[1:30:32] and what the results of those choices
[1:30:34] are you cannot Forno that and so
[1:30:37] marriage is by
[1:30:41] faith you you have to be married on you
[1:30:44] watch their character you do everything
[1:30:46] you can to say and it's still by faith
[1:30:48] right because you don't really know that
[1:30:50] person until you're married so I know
[1:30:54] some people are so scared of marriage
[1:30:56] because well I'll never find the right
[1:30:57] one I tell you what every one of us has
[1:31:00] got faults right and if you look hard
[1:31:02] enough that all of your all the people
[1:31:04] in your life you're going to find faults
[1:31:06] right right you might you might want to
[1:31:08] open yourself up a little bit not to
[1:31:09] somebody outside the word but you ought
[1:31:11] to open yourself up a little bit and say
[1:31:12] God maybe the thing that you have for me
[1:31:14] is different than what I thought yeah
[1:31:17] come on so but now we have we know that
[1:31:20] we can't change the choices that they we
[1:31:22] can't Forno those things but he does
[1:31:25] both right before we ever sinned he knew
[1:31:27] what we would what sin we would do he
[1:31:30] knew all about it yeah amen and he chose
[1:31:33] us before we ever sinned oh aren't you
[1:31:36] glad for that today he chose us in
[1:31:39] eternity before we ever sin Ephesians
[1:31:41] 1:3 blessed be the God and father of our
[1:31:43] Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us
[1:31:45] with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly
[1:31:47] places in Christ according as he had
[1:31:50] chosen Us in him yes before when did he
[1:31:53] do it
[1:31:55] before before I ever sinned before I
[1:31:58] ever made a mistake before I ever
[1:32:00] transgressed his law before I ever
[1:32:03] willfully went out and did things that
[1:32:04] were wrong oh that I ought to make a
[1:32:06] Baptist shout this morning before I was
[1:32:08] ever an unbeliever before I ever messed
[1:32:11] up he chose me when did he choose me
[1:32:15] before before the foundation of the
[1:32:18] earth
[1:32:19] yes before sin could be thought of Amen
[1:32:23] before the world could ever be thought
[1:32:25] of you say but I stole a truck just
[1:32:28] throw that out there I don't know if
[1:32:29] anybody here stole a truck but if you
[1:32:32] stole a truck before the truck was ever
[1:32:34] made he chose you come on before the law
[1:32:39] that said it was wrong to steal the
[1:32:41] truck was ever spoken he chose you
[1:32:45] before the materials that make up the
[1:32:48] truck the steel and and the and the
[1:32:51] computer and everything in the truck are
[1:32:53] made out of something before those
[1:32:55] minerals were ever in the Earth yeah
[1:32:59] Hallelujah if you are the bride of
[1:33:01] Christ today he chose you before all of
[1:33:03] those things before anytime the devil
[1:33:06] tries to come after you and tell you
[1:33:08] well I'm not worthy I can't be a
[1:33:09] Christian I've done too many bad things
[1:33:12] before the foundation of the world he
[1:33:16] chose me but what did he choose me
[1:33:19] for that we should be holy yeah and
[1:33:22] Without Blame before him in love he does
[1:33:26] something that we cannot do he changes
[1:33:30] us right oh
[1:33:33] God he chose us as he wanted us and then
[1:33:37] when we come and we don't fit that
[1:33:38] thought we drop down into time he
[1:33:41] chooses us he's already chosen us and so
[1:33:44] he actually brings us back redeems us
[1:33:47] that's what Redemption means to be
[1:33:49] brought back he redeems us back to the
[1:33:51] the image that he had in his mind to
[1:33:53] begin with I hope you know where I'm
[1:33:56] going this morning see it's not just
[1:33:57] about marriage it's not just about but
[1:33:59] Jesus said take my
[1:34:02] yoke be like
[1:34:05] me Oh my he has chosen us that we should
[1:34:09] be holy and Without Blame having
[1:34:11] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[1:34:17] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[1:34:20] according to the good pleasure of his
[1:34:22] will to the praise of the glory of his
[1:34:24] grace wherein he has made us accepted in
[1:34:27] the Beloved like the farmer that takes
[1:34:30] oh my the yolk and you know they always
[1:34:32] have two a pair of two ox and but the
[1:34:35] one that he can the the way the farmer

[1:34:39] a single plow the farmer has a near oxin
[1:34:42] and a far oxin and the near oxin is the
[1:34:45] one he keeps his eye on and that's the
[1:34:47] most experienced one that's the one who
[1:34:49] makes the least mistakes it's near ox
[1:34:52] and and that one will actually correct
[1:34:54] the behavior of the other ox and listen
[1:34:56] when we're yoked up to Christ what does
[1:34:58] he do he's the one that walks with us he

[1:35:31] fact that you have been
[1:35:33] chosen I wonder if we understand that
[1:35:35] today you can run but you can't
[1:35:39] hide if there's something in your heart
[1:35:42] that pulls you to the message of the
[1:35:43] hour you may go so far that you think
[1:35:46] there's no way you could come back but
[1:35:47] you cannot hide from the grace of God
[1:35:50] Amen if he chose you before the
[1:35:51] foundation of the world you cannot
[1:35:53] Escape that you might as well give in
[1:35:56] and let him have his way he will
[1:35:58] patiently wait until the right time the

[1:36:02] place at the right time that'll speak
[1:36:04] truth into your heart that'll he'll be
[1:36:06] partnering with somebody at that time
[1:36:08] that'll help you because that's how he
[1:36:10] do does it is through men I hope you
[1:36:13] hear me this morning he he will partner
[1:36:15] himself for the man in such a way that
[1:36:17] before the foundation of the world he
[1:36:18] chose you and you will not be able to
[1:36:20] escape it
[1:36:21] he will patiently wait he will set up
[1:36:24] governments and move
[1:36:27] Kings he said how do I know he does that
[1:36:29] you remember when we was preaching about
[1:36:31] Jonah and how that Jonah didn't
[1:36:33] understand why he was going to Nineveh
[1:36:35] but then the ninevites came in and
[1:36:36] invaded Israel after they were saved
[1:36:38] under Jonah's message they turned from
[1:36:41] God invaded Israel and they made
[1:36:43] Samaritans they brought a group in there
[1:36:44] there was half Jew and half Gentile
[1:36:46] those were the Samaritans those were a
[1:36:49] direct result of Jonah going to Nineveh
[1:36:52] oh my and there was one of those
[1:36:53] Samaritans that was a predestined
[1:36:55] elected child of God and she was a woman
[1:36:58] at the well who' had five husbands had
[1:37:01] made many mistakes come on oh my but
[1:37:04] she's sitting on the side she comes up
[1:37:06] to the well there's a man sitting on the
[1:37:07] side of the well he said I have a need
[1:37:09] to go by Samaria he moved
[1:37:11] kingdoms moved a prophet for hundreds of
[1:37:14] years he orchest straight of that until
[1:37:16] you could finally get to a place where
[1:37:18] the woman at the well could be
[1:37:20] saved
[1:37:22] he will wait come
[1:37:24] on
[1:37:27] amen he doesn't get
[1:37:29] discouraged that don't make us happy
[1:37:31] today yeah he doesn't lose his sense of
[1:37:35] purpose yeah come on he doesn't lose his
[1:37:37] Focus right the image that he has of you
[1:37:41] does not get decayed righten listen you
[1:37:43] may have been in sin so long that you
[1:37:45] don't even remember what it was like to
[1:37:46] be a Christian but he never lost what
[1:37:48] you
[1:37:50] were you may have back so far you can't
[1:37:53] remember what it was like to feel the
[1:37:54] presence of God you can't remember what
[1:37:56] it was like to be able to raise your
[1:37:57] hands in church but he can restore you
[1:38:00] to that place yes he knows what you were
[1:38:04] before you were ever in
[1:38:06] sin so he's able to change you and make
[1:38:10] you to be the right kind of an equal
[1:38:13] yoke with him yeah so we can plow
[1:38:16] together and do the things we need to do
[1:38:18] in life now watch the Bible says we know
[1:38:22] that all
[1:38:23] things someone say all things brother

[1:39:02] try to do something for God the devil
[1:39:03] tries to attack me all
[1:39:05] things all things work together yeah
[1:39:08] even the devil's attack only strengthens
[1:39:10] your defense all right even the winds
[1:39:12] that go up against a tree that's planted
[1:39:14] by the rivers of water only strengthen
[1:39:16] the roots of the tree yeah on Hallelujah
[1:39:21] we know that all things work together
[1:39:24] for good to them that love God to them
[1:39:26] who are the called according to his
[1:39:27] purpose the good and the bad are yolked
[1:39:30] together to work together for our good

[1:39:44] but he predestinated them to be
[1:39:46] conformed to the image of his son

[1:40:07] sins a lamb is oh my because if you had
[1:40:10] a donkey born that way you had to kill

[1:48:50] Grace May abound God forbid how shall we

[1:48:55] therein know you not that so many of us
[1:48:57] as were baptized how many of you have
[1:48:59] been baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:49:01] Jesus Christ you've been baptized I I
[1:49:04] know some of you didn't raise your hand
[1:49:05] I've been baptized but but maybe you've
[1:49:07] been baptized and you feel need to be
[1:49:09] re-baptized that's fine but you only
[1:49:11] have to be baptized one time when you're
[1:49:13] baptized you're baptized into the death
[1:49:15] of
[1:49:16] Christ right into the death of Christ
[1:49:19] you young people listen up up you've
[1:49:20] been baptized recently you baptized into
[1:49:22] the death of Christ means you go down
[1:49:25] into a watery grave well it feels like a
[1:49:27] grave doesn't it Melody does it feel
[1:49:30] like a
[1:49:32] grave feels like you're feels like
[1:49:34] you're being laid as cold isn't it laid
[1:49:36] under there trying to get your attention
[1:49:38] Melody just in case you didn't
[1:49:40] know you ra you're lowered down under
[1:49:43] the water and then you come back up yeah
[1:49:46] what is that you were buried with Christ
[1:49:49] amen but Jesus didn't stay in the grave
[1:49:52] right amen we don't leave you under the
[1:49:54] water I know some of y'all feel like I
[1:49:56] left you under the water a long time but
[1:49:57] we didn't we I want just want to make
[1:49:59] sure you got good and
[1:50:02] washed but some of us but Danny we had
[1:50:05] to stay under a long
[1:50:07] time but we're buried so we could be
[1:50:11] resurrected we're not buried to stay
[1:50:13] dead we're buried to be resurrected so
[1:50:15] we're lifted up out of the water to be
[1:50:17] resurrected like as Christ was raised up
[1:50:20] from the dead by the glory of the father
[1:50:21] even so we also should walk in newness
[1:50:23] of life so we must be born again of the
[1:50:25] water blood and spirit and John 3 and5
[1:50:28] Jesus answered verily verily I say unto
[1:50:30] thee except a man be born of water and
[1:50:32] of the spirit he cannot enter into the
[1:50:34] kingdom of God yeah right he cannot be
[1:50:37] yolked with Christ unless he's born of
[1:50:40] water and of the spirit 1 Corinthians
[1:50:41] 12:3 wherefore I give you to understand
[1:50:43] no man speaking by the spirit of God
[1:50:45] call it Jesus a cursed and that no man
[1:50:47] can say Jesus is Lord is the Lord but by
[1:50:50] the Holy Ghost the BR said you don't
[1:50:52] know nothing about it till you've
[1:50:53] received the Holy Ghost you say I accept
[1:50:55] Jesus Christ as my personal savior have
[1:50:58] you received the Holy Ghost since you
[1:50:59] believed if you don't you can't even
[1:51:01] call him the Lord because he's not Lord
[1:51:04] he's a historical being that you by
[1:51:05] faith have accepted but when he's come
[1:51:07] into you by the Holy Ghost he is your
[1:51:09] lord no man can call Jesus Lord only by
[1:51:11] the Holy Ghost until you're born of the
[1:51:13] spirit of God the Holy Ghost is in you
[1:51:15] he said then if you are you're born into
[1:51:16] this Kingdom you're part of the Church
[1:51:17] of the called out ones then he told
[1:51:20] talked about corn he said life can't
[1:51:21] come out of a corn unless there's life
[1:51:23] in it unless it's gerti he can't live
[1:51:25] again it may make good cornbread it may
[1:51:28] make good Corn Flakes it may look like a
[1:51:31] Christian act like a Christian but
[1:51:33] unless it has life in it it'll never
[1:51:35] raise again amen he said a man that's a
[1:51:37] good man could be just as good a church
[1:51:39] member as a Christian a man that's a
[1:51:40] good man could be just as good a citizen
[1:51:42] as a Christian a good man a moral man
[1:51:44] but when he dies that's it unless he's
[1:51:46] born again of the spirit of God because
[1:51:48] everything that had a beginning has an
[1:51:49] end
[1:51:50] God is the only thing that's Eternal
[1:51:52] therefore we're a part of God by
[1:51:53] receiving his life Jesus said I give
[1:51:55] unto them eternal life the Greek word
[1:51:56] there is Zoey means God's own life and
[1:51:59] the only way that you can ever live
[1:52:00] again is to have eternal life which is
[1:52:01] God's life because your life will perish
[1:52:03] but his life will be raised up again
[1:52:05] because God is eternal you've got
[1:52:07] eternal life and can no more die than
[1:52:09] God can die he that believeth on me has
[1:52:11] eternal life I'll raise him up at the
[1:52:12] last day raise him up again the eternal
[1:52:15] life that's in him will raise him up
[1:52:17] amen now brother Brandon said you can't
[1:52:19] get into heaven without being in the
[1:52:22] church well how do I get in the church
[1:52:24] you can't be in the church without the
[1:52:25] Holy
[1:52:26] Ghost right none of you have ever signed
[1:52:28] anything to be in not in this church
[1:52:30] anyway you don't sign nothing come on
[1:52:33] but we're not going to make you say well
[1:52:34] when you start paying ties when you
[1:52:35] start doing this that or the other
[1:52:36] that's not what it's about you do those
[1:52:38] things because you love Jesus not
[1:52:40] because you signed a contract never
[1:52:43] going to come to you and inspect your
[1:52:44] house and say well you know your house
[1:52:46] is okay you can come to church that's
[1:52:49] nonsense
[1:52:50] we want people that love Jesus I'll say
[1:52:53] whatever state that you're in you come
[1:52:54] to church you love God with all of your
[1:52:56] heart but as you love Jesus you begin to
[1:52:59] you begin to let go of things of the
[1:53:00] world because there'll just be something
[1:53:02] in your heart to do that you you can't
[1:53:05] get into heaven without being in the
[1:53:06] church that don't mean being in this
[1:53:07] building it means being a part of the of
[1:53:09] the Church of Jesus Christ the bride you
[1:53:12] can't go to Heaven till you're born
[1:53:13] again if you're born again you're in the
[1:53:14] church so you can't go to Heaven till
[1:53:16] you're a member this church you can't be
[1:53:18] a member till you're born into it
[1:53:20] he said now let me smother you a little
[1:53:22] you can't be a member unless God has
[1:53:23] called you to be a member right how
[1:53:25] happy you ought to be for that because
[1:53:27] you were predestinated before the
[1:53:28] foundation of the world how many believe
[1:53:30] that today very quickly how do I receive
[1:53:33] the Holy Ghost Peter in Acts 238 s unto
[1:53:35] them repent be baptized every one of you
[1:53:37] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[1:53:38] remission of sins and you shall receive
[1:53:41] the gift of the Holy Ghost you said but
[1:53:44] how do I know that I have it 1 John 51
[1:53:47] let's turn there before we close first
[1:53:49] John John
[1:53:53] 51
[1:53:55] whosoever whosoever believeth that Jesus
[1:53:59] is the Christ is born of God and
[1:54:02] everyone that loveth him that
[1:54:04] begat that's the father loveth him also
[1:54:08] that is begotten of
[1:54:11] him by this we know that we love the
[1:54:13] children of God he's been talking about
[1:54:16] loving the children of God loving one
[1:54:18] another he said when we love God and
[1:54:21] keep his commandments so we can express
[1:54:24] it like this the love of God in our
[1:54:26] heart causes us to love one another and
