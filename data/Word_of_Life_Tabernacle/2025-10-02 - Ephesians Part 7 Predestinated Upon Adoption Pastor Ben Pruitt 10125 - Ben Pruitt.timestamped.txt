[37:04] That means you're part of his plan.
[37:06] Amen. What can the devil do to you if
[37:09] you're part of God's plan? Thank the
[37:11] Lord. God bless you. You may be seated
[37:12] tonight.
[37:15] I want to make a disclaimer right at the
[37:17] beginning that we won't say everything
[37:19] there is to say about adoption tonight.
[37:21] We're going to get into this in depth
[37:23] that the Lord allows me to and as he
[37:26] leads me to uh and and we just you just
[37:29] pray for me. We'll do that. But it's
[37:31] only a background tonight. We're going
[37:33] to do a lot of reading. So you just bear
[37:35] with me tonight.
[37:38] Just going to go ahead and get
[37:39] comfortable. That jacket's a little warm
[37:41] and a little small.
[37:45] You glad you come to church on a
[37:46] Wednesday night?
[37:48] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon makes a statement. He
[37:50] says, "What is adoption?" That's how he
[37:53] begins explaining adoption in the
[37:55] adoption series. I think it's actually
[37:57] in adoption number two. Brother Brandon
[37:59] begins to explain adoption.
[38:02] What is adoption? And uh the first thing
[38:05] that comes to mind when we think about
[38:06] adoption is we think about adopting a
[38:09] baby. And what brother Brandham is
[38:11] talking about is something completely
[38:12] different. Right? So it's not taking a
[38:15] child from one family and placing them
[38:18] in another family, but it's actually
[38:21] coming to a place of maturity in your
[38:23] own life or in uh in the church as we'll
[38:27] see the church coming to a place of
[38:29] maturity or the individual coming to a
[38:31] place of maturity. God bless you,
[38:32] brother Wald. It's so good to see you in
[38:34] church. I didn't see you Sunday morning,
[38:36] but it's good to have you back there.
[38:38] But you, it's a place of maturity. It's
[38:40] not a It's not coming from one family to
[38:43] the other because you always were a
[38:45] child of God. So he says you were
[38:47] predestinated. That's what Paul's saying
[38:48] in Ephesians 1:5. You were predestinated
[38:52] unto adoption. How many believe that
[38:55] tonight? So what that means is you were
[38:57] predestinated to maturity. You were not
[39:01] just predestinated to be a child of God
[39:03] or to be a Christian, but to be a mature
[39:06] Christian. And especially in the age
[39:08] that we're living in. So the church was
[39:10] predestinated to be a mature church.
[39:13] There would come a maturity. There would
[39:15] become a manifestation. There would come
[39:17] a fullness of time. It wouldn't just
[39:19] stay in its in its infant stage all the
[39:22] time or the entire gentile age, but it
[39:25] would actually become something far
[39:27] more. So brother Brandham goes into
[39:28] this. He said, "Your adoption is not
[39:31] your birth. Your adoption is not your
[39:34] birth. Your adoption is your placing."
[39:36] And again, we want to be very careful
[39:38] with that because people making a
[39:40] mystery out of a mystery and trying to
[39:42] push an agenda many times will get into
[39:46] it and actually make adoption something
[39:47] that it's not. Brother Brandham actually
[39:49] changes the language that he uses after
[39:52] the seals and he begins to talk about
[39:54] placing and it begins to talk about
[39:57] maturity and about sunship and the
[39:59] opening of the word and things that we
[40:01] recognize more than maybe we would the
[40:03] term adoption but it's the same thing.
[40:05] So your adoption is not your birth. Your
[40:08] adoption is your placing. When you were
[40:09] born again, when we are born of the
[40:12] spirit of God, we are sons of God. How
[40:15] many believe that tonight? So, you are a
[40:17] son of God when you're born of the
[40:18] spirit of God. But we were
[40:20] predestinated. He said, "Now, here's
[40:22] what I'm trying to get you to for the
[40:24] sons of the last day." He said, "We were
[40:27] predestinated unto adoption." He said,
[40:30] "Now, this is what hurts Pentecostal a
[40:33] little. They say, I got born again.
[40:36] Praise the Lord. Got the Holy Ghost.
[40:38] Fine. You're a child of God." That's
[40:40] right. He said, "But yet, that ain't
[40:42] what I'm talking about." Right? So,
[40:44] there's something beyond your birth. And
[40:46] I guess uh you know in my purpose in
[40:48] preaching this is to uh let us know that
[40:52] uh there's more to it than just being
[40:54] born. There's more to it than just being
[40:56] in church.
[40:59] &gt;&gt; There's more to it than just being a
[41:00] believer. In fact, the devil believes
[41:03] and trembles, but he he can't believe
[41:06] what you believe. He can't be what you
[41:08] are, but yet he believes the word of
[41:10] God. He can believe the written word. It
[41:13] come to me the other day that the devil
[41:15] can believe the written word. What he
[41:17] can't believe is the manifested word.
[41:20] &gt;&gt; He believed and quoted the scripture to
[41:22] Jesus when he tempted him, but he could
[41:24] not believe that Jesus was the Christ.
[41:27] And and so that's what he doubted. And
[41:30] and so it's not enough just to believe.
[41:32] It's not enough. And brother Brandon
[41:33] makes these same points in the token
[41:35] message. He said, "You've got to display
[41:37] the token." So I want to you to think
[41:39] about that. Displaying the token is a
[41:42] place of maturity beyond the token
[41:44] itself, beyond just receiving the token.
[41:48] There's actually a place where you can
[41:49] display it where where you it can begin
[41:52] to work in your life. It can begin to be
[41:54] effective in your life. So what we want
[41:56] is not just people who have become
[41:58] Christians or people who say they
[42:00] believe the message. What we want is
[42:02] people who actually live the message and
[42:04] become the message. Don't is that what
[42:06] you want tonight? I don't want to just
[42:08] be a Christian and name only. I want to
[42:10] be what God wants me to be in the age
[42:12] that he has planted me in.
[42:16] &gt;&gt; So you were predestinated unto adoption.
[42:18] Adoption is placing a son. Placing a
[42:23] son. So it's not the new birth. It's not
[42:26] just simply receiving the Holy Ghost,
[42:28] but it's placing a son. Where does
[42:31] brother Brandham get this from? He get
[42:32] this gets this from Galatians chapter 4.
[42:35] If you'll turn there with me. Galatians
[42:37] chapter 4 and verse one. Paul explains
[42:39] what adoption or or that maturity was
[42:42] like
[42:43] uh how a a son would come to full age
[42:47] during that time according to the law.
[42:50] And Paul says, "Now I say that the heir
[42:53] and that's the that's the child, the
[42:55] person who's the legal heir, as long as
[42:58] he is a child, differereth nothing from
[43:01] a servant." Word servant is slave.
[43:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[43:04] &gt;&gt; Right. Some of you kids could say amen
[43:07] to that.
[43:09] Right. But the heir, as long as he's a
[43:11] child, differereth nothing from a
[43:13] servant, though he be lord of all. So,
[43:16] so he's born owner, right? The future
[43:20] owner of the property, right? He he's
[43:23] he's a son of the owner. He's born that
[43:26] way. And yet, as a child in his
[43:28] immaturity, he doesn't have any say over
[43:32] anything,
[43:33] &gt;&gt; right? So he owns everything but has no
[43:37] authority over anything. So do you see
[43:40] how adoption begins to come in? Adoption
[43:43] is actually uh is actually bringing the
[43:46] the the child into a place of uh of not
[43:50] having uh not just being a child. Not
[43:53] just being a son, not just saying I'm
[43:55] predestinated, but actually having the
[43:58] authority to speak something. and and
[44:00] brother Brandham takes that into a a
[44:02] place of being able to say to the
[44:04] mountain, "Be thou removed and cast into
[44:06] the sea and being able to sign your name
[44:08] on the checkbook and all of those
[44:10] things." And listen to me. I'm going to
[44:12] give this away at the beginning so you
[44:13] see where we're going. But this is the
[44:16] age of that. This is the age of the
[44:18] fullness. This is the age when we have
[44:20] the potential to do that.
[44:23] &gt;&gt; How many believe that tonight?
[44:25] So now he said he's he's though he be
[44:29] lord of all but it's under tutors and
[44:31] governors. That's teachers and teachers
[44:35] and uh uh I'm searching for a word here.
[44:39] I had it. I should have written it down.
[44:40] But it's a teacher and a guardian is
[44:43] what it is. A teacher and a guardian
[44:45] until the time appointed of the father.
[44:48] So the father has got an appointed time
[44:51] that the son is supposed to come into
[44:54] his maturity. Now Paul types this to the
[44:57] law and and becoming grace. So the law
[45:01] was just a teacher to bring us to grace.
[45:05] &gt;&gt; It was a temporary condition,
[45:08] &gt;&gt; right? To bring us to grace. So he said,
[45:12] "But when the fullness of time was
[45:13] come," he said, he said, "Even when we
[45:16] were children, we're in bondage under
[45:17] the illness of the world. But when the
[45:18] fullness of the time was come, God sent
[45:21] forth his son made of a woman, made
[45:23] under the law to redeem them that were
[45:25] under the law, that we might receive the
[45:29] adoption
[45:30] of sons."
[45:32] So what he's saying is there had to come
[45:34] a full age. A time when uh what happened
[45:38] Christ had to come to full age,
[45:40] &gt;&gt; right? That was the mature one that God
[45:43] would put his confidence in and his
[45:45] trust in so that he could begin to
[45:47] speak. He was the word and it begin to
[45:50] speak. And that's I don't want to scare
[45:52] you tonight, but that's where he wants
[45:53] to bring us to. He don't want to just
[45:56] make us another church. He don't want to
[45:57] just make us another denomination. We're
[46:00] not here just to have good services.
[46:01] We're not here just to shout and dance
[46:03] and run the hours. That's good. Well,
[46:05] that's part of it. But that's not what
[46:06] we're here for. We're here to become so
[46:08] much more than that. That that you could
[46:11] actually become a a a person, a son or
[46:14] daughter of God with the authority to
[46:17] speak and to and to you say, "Well, if
[46:20] my pastor was there, so and so was
[46:22] there, Brother Brandon was there." No.
[46:24] It could be a situation that you didn't
[46:26] have anybody to help you, but you're a
[46:28] son of God. you're a daughter of God and
[46:30] you can speak to your mountain and see
[46:32] it begin to be moved.
[46:36] &gt;&gt; So that's where he brought Christ to
[46:38] that adoption of sons.
[46:41] But it's the adoption of sons, not just
[46:43] the adoption of the son, right?
[46:46] &gt;&gt; So in the CSB study Bible, it says in
[46:51] the ancient world, an underage heir had
[46:53] no right to his inheritance. It was
[46:56] temporarily like that.
[46:59] temporarily in the same legal situation
[47:01] as a slave owning nothing.
[47:05] So, he's not a slave. But how is he not
[47:09] a slave? In his potential. Do you see
[47:12] where I'm going tonight?
[47:15] Listen, if you were just born again, you
[47:17] were you just come into the house of
[47:19] God, you just come through
[47:21] justification, maybe you're at the very
[47:23] first stage of being born again, right?
[47:25] You you're the elected of God. You
[47:28] belong to God. You're every bit as much
[47:31] a Christian as anybody else.
[47:33] &gt;&gt; You're not a slave,
[47:36] &gt;&gt; right? But but you still in many ways
[47:38] live as a slave.
[47:40] &gt;&gt; And there's addictions and struggles and
[47:43] all kinds of things that maybe you got
[47:45] to work your way through and and a
[47:47] mindset of slavery, a mindset of, you
[47:50] know, and and so you're still working
[47:51] your way through that, but you're not a
[47:53] slave. You belong to God because your
[47:56] potential is more than that. You might
[47:58] live just like everybody else does. You
[48:00] might have had just as bad a life as
[48:02] anybody else had, but you're becoming
[48:04] something more than that. So don't give
[48:06] up where you're at. Remember, there's a
[48:08] potential for so much more in the age
[48:10] that you live in. That's what I love
[48:12] about this message. This message doesn't
[48:14] leave us and just say, "Well, we have
[48:16] grace. We have we're elected. We're
[48:18] called. And so we'll just we'll just
[48:20] trust God somehow to get us through." We
[48:22] should trust God, but we trust God not
[48:24] just to get us to heaven, but to make us
[48:26] real sons and daughters of God that can
[48:28] live in this present world and have
[48:30] victory over the enemy, victory over the
[48:33] things that are going on in our lives.
[48:35] Yes,
[48:35] &gt;&gt; sir.
[48:38] &gt;&gt; So, the the word child there in
[48:41] Galatians 4:1, a child is nepio, one
[48:44] that does not talk.
[48:50] So,
[48:52] And some children still talk but but
[48:55] this was a child. That's what the Greek
[48:57] word child means. One that does not
[49:00] talk.
[49:01] The word epos is word that's a minor an
[49:06] infant immature intellectually and
[49:09] morally
[49:11] in contrast with telio or tell it all.
[49:17] I'm not sure that's a correct
[49:18] translation, but Tellio is an adult,
[49:21] full grown,
[49:23] &gt;&gt; he speaks,
[49:25] right? So, a non-speaking child
[49:28] contrasted with a speaking adult,
[49:31] somebody who can speak intelligently.
[49:33] So uh it's talking about how that you
[49:36] know in in the time of the law the
[49:39] people were brought through the
[49:41] tutorship of the law to Christ and then
[49:44] the tutor had done his job and he left
[49:47] them there and they come to Christ. Now
[49:51] it it's shown that the capability of
[49:53] airship which was first conferred
[49:54] through Christ could not enter earlier
[49:57] into the history of mankind. So there
[49:59] was a time, right? When the fullness of
[50:02] time was come, God was born of a woman,
[50:06] &gt;&gt; right? It had to be time,
[50:08] &gt;&gt; this is very important. It couldn't
[50:10] happen earlier than that. It had to be a
[50:12] time
[50:13] &gt;&gt; that the fullness could come into the
[50:14] world. And even though Isaiah spoke it
[50:17] and even in Genesis it was spoken of all
[50:20] down through the histories and and ages
[50:22] it was spoken of. But there had to come
[50:24] a time when a virgin would conceive and
[50:26] he would become a a full-grown son. And
[50:29] even in Jesus life, there was a time he
[50:32] didn't begin his ministry right away. In
[50:34] fact, he was 30 years old when he began
[50:36] his ministry. There was a time there was
[50:38] a time he went up on Mount
[50:39] Transfiguration. There was a time of
[50:41] fullness of time.
[50:43] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? Just like you have
[50:46] a time,
[50:47] &gt;&gt; just like this age had a time.
[50:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:52] &gt;&gt; Now,
[50:54] so the the time wasn't right. Mankind
[50:57] was still in its minority and its
[50:59] majority, its sunship was first entered
[51:02] upon through Christ.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; What does Romans 10:4 say? For Christ is
[51:07] the end of the law for righteousness to
[51:11] everyone that believeth. Christ is the
[51:15] end of the law. So the law was a
[51:18] temporary condition under Moses right
[51:21] under the tutor
[51:23] &gt;&gt; until the son became of full age
[51:27] right and he become the adopted son. Now
[51:31] the Bible says that we know that all
[51:33] things someone say all things
[51:35] &gt;&gt; work together for good to them that love
[51:37] God
[51:38] &gt;&gt; to them who are the called according to
[51:40] his purpose. for whom he did forno.
[51:43] He that means he he knew you. He knew
[51:45] about you. He knew everything you would
[51:46] do and everything you would be. He he
[51:49] predestinated you to be conformed to the
[51:53] image of his son. So he didn't
[51:56] predestinate you to be you.
[51:59] &gt;&gt; He predestinated you to be changed.
[52:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:05] &gt;&gt; What does it say? He predestinated you
[52:07] to be changed or conformed to the image
[52:11] of his son. So you were to be changed
[52:14] into a son of God.
[52:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[52:16] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? You were a son of
[52:18] God in seed form, but he wanted you to
[52:20] be changed into a a full-blown son of
[52:23] God.
[52:24] &gt;&gt; And he said, for whom he did forno, he
[52:26] also did predestinate to be conformed to
[52:28] the image of his son. Uh listen, not
[52:30] just doing baby stuff, not just
[52:32] squabbling about, you know, I know
[52:33] people, they just stay in the land of
[52:36] hurt feelings and they remain in the in
[52:39] the minority of their lives. They just
[52:41] always remained in this place where they
[52:43] just fuss and fight and squabble. But
[52:45] we're called to do something more than
[52:47] that. We're called to do something more
[52:49] than fight over who gets to preach when
[52:51] and who gets to do this win and who gets
[52:53] to who gets this person in their church
[52:55] or that person in their church. We've
[52:57] been called beyond that. We've been
[52:58] given a message to come to maturity.
[53:02] &gt;&gt; Preach. Now,
[53:04] &gt;&gt; we're not called to just stay here.
[53:07] &gt;&gt; I got this microphone I want to preach
[53:08] tonight.
[53:10] &gt;&gt; You just bear with me. I'm trying to be
[53:13] good. Now, I've been studying this for a
[53:15] while. Just trying and tonight we're
[53:17] just kind of laying a background, but I
[53:19] believe it'll be something good in it.
[53:20] There's the word is always good, isn't
[53:22] it? Yes.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; Now,
[53:26] you know, we could preach on some things
[53:27] that it wouldn't touch some people,
[53:30] right? If I preach on healing, there's
[53:31] some people maybe don't need physical
[53:33] healing, right? Maybe very few of us,
[53:35] but there are some. And if you preach
[53:38] there some things you preach on
[53:39] salvation, some people, many people
[53:41] don't need that. They've already been
[53:44] saved. What are we preaching on? We're
[53:46] preaching on something that affects all
[53:47] of us.
[53:49] &gt;&gt; Because let me give you a little bit of
[53:50] preview here. None of us have gotten
[53:52] there yet,
[53:54] &gt;&gt; right? None of us have come to the
[53:56] fullness of our adoption,
[53:58] &gt;&gt; but this is the age for it,
[54:00] &gt;&gt; hallelujah. This is the time for it.
[54:03] This is the era of it. If there, if it's
[54:05] ever going to be preached, now is the
[54:06] time to preach it because the fullness
[54:08] of it is the change of these bodies. He
[54:10] don't want to just change our souls. He
[54:12] don't want to just change our minds. He
[54:14] don't But he wants to change our bodies.
[54:17] &gt;&gt; Say, God, have your perfect work in me.
[54:20] I want to be that person that's changed.
[54:22] I want to be different than what I was.
[54:23] I want to be different than what my what
[54:26] my upbringing is or what my what my
[54:28] complexes are, what I what the things I
[54:30] want to be different than that. I want
[54:32] to be all that you want me to be.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So he he he he predestined
[54:38] us to be conformed to the image of his
[54:40] son. What's he saying? The same thing he
[54:42] said in Ephesians 1:5. You are
[54:44] predestinated to the adoption of sons.
[54:48] &gt;&gt; Right? to be conformed to the image of
[54:50] his son, that he might be the firstborn
[54:52] &gt;&gt; among many brethren.
[54:56] &gt;&gt; Moreover, whom he did predestinate,
[54:59] &gt;&gt; them he also called. Yes, sir.
[55:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. No more and no less.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; Whom he called, them he also justified.
[55:07] &gt;&gt; Whom he justified, them he also
[55:09] glorified. Don't give up because you're
[55:11] down here in a baby condition, but move
[55:13] on. Come on up into something greater.
[55:17] come on up into the message of the hour,
[55:20] &gt;&gt; right? And that's where we always got to
[55:21] be. And you know, I want to take it easy
[55:23] on people. I don't want to force the
[55:25] message on people that aren't ready for
[55:27] it. But I'll say this. You got to move
[55:29] on at some point.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[55:31] &gt;&gt; At some point, you got to believe the
[55:33] message and move on and and and just
[55:35] believe and and be able to say amen to
[55:37] it. You said, "Well, I don't
[55:38] understand." At some point, you got to
[55:40] be able to believe it
[55:41] &gt;&gt; and move on and become a full-g grown
[55:43] son or daughter of God,
[55:45] &gt;&gt; right? Because this has to mature so
[55:47] that this outer body can be changed to
[55:49] match it. There's got to be a condition
[55:51] of the soul that'll match the condition
[55:54] that we got to be in for the rapture. Oh
[55:56] my, I want my body changed. How many
[55:57] wants their body changed? In order to
[55:59] have a body changed, you had to have
[56:01] this message. You cannot come to a
[56:03] rapture without a shout.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; Huh? Revelation 1 Thessalonians 4, he
[56:09] said there would be a shout, a voice,
[56:10] and a trumpet. You cannot come. Oh my.
[56:13] You cannot come to the rapture without
[56:15] that shout. You must hear the voice of
[56:18] God. You must hear the shout of that was
[56:21] a brother Brandham taught us was the
[56:23] message of the hour.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; You must hear that to be in a rapture. I
[56:28] want to be there.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; I don't want to get in by the skin of my
[56:31] teeth. I don't want to go through the
[56:32] tribulation period. You know, people
[56:34] say, "Why don't you preach more in the
[56:35] tribulation period?" period. Well, cuz I
[56:36] want to avoid it.
[56:39] &gt;&gt; Quite literally.
[56:44] &gt;&gt; There's going to be a squeeze. Is there
[56:45] going to be a crackdown? There's going
[56:46] to be all that. Well, I'm I'm doing my
[56:48] best to avoid it all.
[56:50] &gt;&gt; Whatever happens happens, but I'll say
[56:52] this. I'm ready to go home.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; Lord, just help me be ready.
[56:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:59] Now, look,
[57:02] he said, moreover, whom he did
[57:03] predestin, he also called. We read that.
[57:05] Brother Brandham introduces that idea.
[57:08] Now, so adoption, what is adoption? It's
[57:11] bringing you from a minority state to a
[57:13] majority state.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; Does that make sense? From a child
[57:19] &gt;&gt; to an adult,
[57:22] &gt;&gt; right? So, it' be like with our
[57:25] children, they turn 18.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[57:28] &gt;&gt; Right.
[57:32] But if if you're a dad, you understand
[57:34] that just cuz they're 18 don't mean
[57:36] they're an adult,
[57:38] &gt;&gt; right?
[57:41] You know that they got to be there's
[57:42] certain things that have to happen in
[57:44] their life,
[57:45] &gt;&gt; right? That's why some young people, not
[57:48] any here, but but there are young people
[57:50] who physically or mentally cannot become
[57:53] an adult, right?
[57:55] &gt;&gt; And so what what they just stay in that
[57:56] infant stage? Well, there's Christians
[57:58] like that,
[58:00] &gt;&gt; but I believe if you're born into this
[58:01] word age, you're called to be
[58:04] &gt;&gt; a son, a full-grown son of God,
[58:06] &gt;&gt; so we don't want to stay in that stage.
[58:08] And and but but that would be kind of
[58:11] what it would be to us. Maybe 21
[58:13] &gt;&gt; would be a better number, right? And 18,
[58:16] 21, there's certain things you can do
[58:18] and certain things that you can uh you
[58:21] can sign your name to and things. when
[58:23] you're 21 years old, you can just about
[58:25] uh you're free and 21, as they say.
[58:29] You're just able to do what you want to
[58:31] do. And that's that's a good thing. But
[58:34] but that's kind of the idea of adoption
[58:37] is that it's bringing you through this.
[58:38] You needed a tutor. But in order to
[58:41] inherit the son, the son that was there,
[58:44] he had to do more than just be there. He
[58:46] had to actually perform in a certain
[58:49] way. He had to show himself capable of
[58:53] handling the father's estate or the
[58:55] estate would never be handed over to
[58:57] him,
[58:58] &gt;&gt; right? And and so he had to show himself
[59:00] capable. So Brandham introduces that
[59:03] idea of adoption to the age, right? To
[59:06] the church as a whole. And so he said
[59:08] adoption, let me show you why it's done.
[59:10] Now he said a father has a big kingdom.
[59:12] He rides around. He said now he's got a
[59:15] son born. Oh, he's so happy. He said
[59:17] that's God. Sister Joanna, I don't want
[59:19] to scare you. I I can I I know already
[59:21] I'm not going to get through all these
[59:22] slides. So
[59:24] he said, "So, you know what that father
[59:26] does? He finds the very best razor. I
[59:30] like that razor. R A I S E R. Tutor,
[59:34] right? A person to raise the child." So,
[59:36] a tutor in that age wouldn't be wouldn't
[59:38] be like a teacher we have today. Brother
[59:40] Gabe, aren't you glad that if you're a a
[59:42] teacher that you you you can leave the
[59:44] kids at class?
[59:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; Right.
[59:49] Aren't you glad you Sunday school
[59:50] teachers, aren't you? Maybe I better not
[59:52] go there. Aren't you glad you don't have
[59:54] to take them all home with you,
[59:57] &gt;&gt; right? You get to leave them there. But
[59:59] that's not the way a tutor did in that
[1:00:00] time. A tutor that was called uh to to a
[1:00:04] certain home to tutor this child was
[1:00:06] with them 24/7.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; They were called to raise them.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; Huh? To to be their tutor, to be their
[1:00:12] raiser. He said, "You know what a tutor
[1:00:14] is, don't you? It's a school teacher. He
[1:00:16] finds the very best school teacher he
[1:00:17] can find in all the country. He don't
[1:00:19] just get a scallwag. He wants his boy to
[1:00:21] be a real fellow.
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; He said he'd be an honest tutor. He
[1:00:24] wouldn't be no bishop or general
[1:00:26] overseer. He said he didn't get no
[1:00:28] bishop or general overseer. He got the
[1:00:29] Holy Ghost. That was his tutor. Aren't
[1:00:31] you glad he did? He said, "Uh-huh. To
[1:00:34] raise his children." So, it's the Holy
[1:00:36] Ghost that raises the church. Why we say
[1:00:38] you must be born again. You've got to
[1:00:40] have the Holy Ghost cuz that's when your
[1:00:41] raising starts
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; right now. He said that was his tutor to
[1:00:47] raise his children. All right. Then how
[1:00:48] would you know the Holy Ghost knows it?
[1:00:50] I love this. He speaks through human
[1:00:52] lips. So something had to happen in our
[1:00:56] day, brother Harold, for something had
[1:01:00] to happen for us to have confidence in
[1:01:03] the tutor
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; to be able to listen to what he was
[1:01:06] saying. Something had to grab our
[1:01:08] attention.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost had to speak through
[1:01:12] human lips.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; Go to that next slide, Sister Joanna. He
[1:01:15] said, I got to turn around here where I
[1:01:16] can see it. He said, "How do you know
[1:01:18] then he's telling the truth?" How do we
[1:01:21] know that the Holy Ghost is leading us
[1:01:23] in the right direction? How do you know
[1:01:25] he's telling the truth? When you see the
[1:01:27] Holy Spirit speaking through lips,
[1:01:29] that's telling the truth exactly every
[1:01:32] time, predicting and coming to pass just
[1:01:35] perfectly like Samuel said, then you
[1:01:37] know that's truthmen,
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; right? What what they say? Let none of
[1:01:41] his words fall to the ground,
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; right? It's coming, right? Because God
[1:01:46] says, Hallelujah. If he speaks and what
[1:01:49] he says don't come to pass, don't hear
[1:01:51] him because I'm not with him. But if he
[1:01:53] does, well then hear him cuz I'm with
[1:01:55] him.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; Right? He said now. So, so what had to
[1:01:59] happen? What had to happen? There had to
[1:02:01] be the Holy Spirit had to speak through
[1:02:03] lips.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; And say, "Your name is."
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; Right. You realize how important that
[1:02:10] was in our age
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; that a prophet would speak and say,
[1:02:13] "Your name is so and so."
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; You were born on a certain street. You
[1:02:18] had this happen to you when you were a
[1:02:19] child. Why was he able to say it? Give
[1:02:21] us confidence.
[1:02:23] in the tutor. We listen church. We need
[1:02:25] to have confidence in the Holy Ghost
[1:02:27] tonight. We need to have confidence in
[1:02:29] the message of the hour. When we saw the
[1:02:31] accuracy of it, that was the confidence.
[1:02:34] That's why we don't we don't stand for
[1:02:36] any kind of impersonation.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; Right? Because an impersonator will
[1:02:41] cause you to doubt the accuracy of the
[1:02:44] real.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; That's what Janice and Jambers did.
[1:02:49] That's what Dayan and Kora did. They
[1:02:52] cause people to doubt. That's what the
[1:02:53] charismatic move has done. Cause people
[1:02:55] to doubt the accuracy of the word. But
[1:02:57] we had a prophet who God did not let his
[1:03:00] words fall to the ground.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; God says if he speaks and what he says
[1:03:06] don't come to pass, don't hear him
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; cuz I'm not with him.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; But if he does, hear him cuz I'm with
[1:03:14] him.
[1:03:16] He said, now then he goes around. I
[1:03:17] don't know. What do you think that tutor
[1:03:18] would say if you had to go up to the
[1:03:19] father and say, "Your children's acting
[1:03:22] awful."
[1:03:24] I tell you, that boy of yours, he's a
[1:03:26] renegade. He's a rouseabout.
[1:03:29] I never seen such a fellow. That girl of
[1:03:33] yours, oh, I don't know what you're
[1:03:35] going to do with her. You know what?
[1:03:37] She's all painted up like some of them
[1:03:38] girls over yonder, Philistines. Yes,
[1:03:41] sir. She just wants to act just like
[1:03:42] they do.
[1:03:44] My daughter? Yes, your daughter. That's
[1:03:47] what Now listen church.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon's talking about more
[1:03:51] than individuals. Although he is
[1:03:52] speaking to individuals, but he's
[1:03:53] talking about more than that.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; He's talking about a church,
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; right? That had not come to an age of
[1:03:59] maturity even though the time for the
[1:04:02] maturity had come.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; So it was the end of the Leoian church
[1:04:06] age. And God called a prophet to tell
[1:04:08] him, you've not come to the maturity
[1:04:10] that you should have come to. You need
[1:04:12] to have confidence in the Holy Ghost.
[1:04:14] You need to have conf oh my confidence
[1:04:16] in the word. And some of us caught it.
[1:04:18] Some people caught it, but many didn't
[1:04:20] catch it. Many people just continued on
[1:04:22] in their denominations and fussing and
[1:04:25] fighting and and carrying on the way
[1:04:26] that they were. But brother told, the
[1:04:28] reason you have gifts out of order, the
[1:04:30] reason you have family life out of
[1:04:32] order, the reason that you have all of
[1:04:34] these things wrong is because that
[1:04:37] you're not come to that place of
[1:04:38] maturity and you need something to
[1:04:41] happen. What needed to happen? Malachi 4
[1:04:43] needed to happen. Revelation 10:1-7
[1:04:46] needed to happen. Luke 17:30 needed to
[1:04:49] happen to give us confidence in the
[1:04:51] opening of the word that we could come
[1:04:53] to the fullness of maturity.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; A voice of authority had to speak.
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; He said, "My daughter, yes, your
[1:05:06] daughter." That's what the Holy Spirit
[1:05:08] has to say about the church today.
[1:05:10] He said, 'N no wonder we can't have a
[1:05:12] revival.
[1:05:14] What about your son? Same thing.
[1:05:17] Well, you know, you always said those
[1:05:18] sheep could hurt in that pasture up
[1:05:19] there on that sheep food up there. Yeah.
[1:05:21] You know what he did? He drove them down
[1:05:23] there in that weed pile.
[1:05:26] Now, Brother Brand was talking to
[1:05:27] preachers.
[1:05:29] They just took them down there and
[1:05:30] dumped them all in that creek. Let them
[1:05:33] lay around that weed pile, eating them
[1:05:34] old willows, and they're so poor they
[1:05:36] can't hardly get out of there. He said,
[1:05:38] "That's bishops, pastors who deny the
[1:05:40] power thereof."
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; Listen, church, we're all human beings.
[1:05:47] I'm a human being. I I get sick
[1:05:49] sometimes, but I know a healer.
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; I get tired sometimes, but I know a
[1:05:53] sustainer of strength. I get I get
[1:05:55] worried sometimes, but I know one who
[1:05:58] gives peace that passes all
[1:05:59] understanding. I I may not, but let me
[1:06:02] point you to him. Let me take you to the
[1:06:03] place where the food is. Let me take you
[1:06:06] not to a weed pile of the world and just
[1:06:08] say everything's okay, but let me point
[1:06:10] you back to somebody who's got all the
[1:06:12] answers. I don't have all the answers,
[1:06:14] but Christ has all the answers. Do you
[1:06:16] believe that tonight?
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; He said he drove them down that weed
[1:06:19] pile, took them down there and dumped
[1:06:20] them all in that creek, let them lay
[1:06:22] around that weed pile, eating them old
[1:06:24] willows. They're so poor they can't
[1:06:26] hardly get out of there. That's bishop's
[1:06:28] pastors that deny the power there. Well,
[1:06:30] I tell you the truth, I never seen such
[1:06:32] a bunch of nervous sheep in my life.
[1:06:35] So the tutor,
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; the Holy Ghost is coming back to the
[1:06:39] father and telling him bunch of nervous
[1:06:41] sheep. And brother Brandon said he don't
[1:06:43] like that,
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; Nervous sheep. They haven't been taught
[1:06:48] who they are.
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; Right? They think a preacher can take
[1:06:51] them out of it.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; Have we labored in Ephesians in the
[1:06:54] beginning of Ephesians to find out who
[1:06:56] we are?
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; Find out we weren't called by a
[1:06:58] preacher. We weren't called by by a
[1:07:00] mother somewhere or a father. We were
[1:07:02] called by God. We were predestined by
[1:07:04] God unto adoption. We were we were
[1:07:06] called by God to be who we are.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; So God don't like nervous sheep.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; He don't like that under that
[1:07:16] legalistic, you know, weeds.
[1:07:19] Are are you with me now?
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; He don't like that. You know, and you
[1:07:22] know what them cattle up here, you know,
[1:07:24] you told them feed on that alphaalfpha
[1:07:26] up there, you know, to make them fat.
[1:07:28] You know what he's given them? said
[1:07:30] giving them iron weeds, making them join
[1:07:33] societies and said, "You never seen such
[1:07:35] a thing in your life." You know what
[1:07:36] he's doing? Going along out there
[1:07:37] smoking a big cigar, reared back. Got
[1:07:40] his wife with him. She's wearing shorts
[1:07:42] just like the Philistines are doing out
[1:07:43] there.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's the kind of message the
[1:07:46] Holy Spirit has to take about church
[1:07:49] today.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon said, "That's adoption."
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; You see how simple that is? We just had
[1:07:58] to be taught. I didn't just
[1:08:00] automatically know that it was wrong to
[1:08:02] do certain things. Brother Danny, why do
[1:08:04] we know what we know? Because of the
[1:08:06] message of the hour.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; Why do we know what we know? Because God
[1:08:11] sent a prophet our way. He said,
[1:08:13] "Brother Ben, you talk about that a lot.
[1:08:14] But if you can ever grab the reality of
[1:08:16] that,
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; right? That that the message was given.
[1:08:19] It wasn't just given to us to give us
[1:08:21] something to fight about. It was given
[1:08:23] to us to give us something to feed on
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; so we could feed on it. So we could
[1:08:28] become what it's talking about. We would
[1:08:30] know what to do and what not to do and
[1:08:32] how to act and how not to act.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; Right? And to be full-grown children of
[1:08:36] God.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; So he said that's adoption. What did he
[1:08:40] do? He predestined us unto adoption. He
[1:08:42] give us the Holy Ghost. But wait a
[1:08:44] minute, adoption. He said that's what
[1:08:46] we're talking about. He talked about how
[1:08:48] they refuse to cooperate with healing
[1:08:49] meetings. And he he said, "Here I come
[1:08:51] and tell him the truth right out of your
[1:08:53] word. Here it is. I read your laws to
[1:08:55] him exactly what to do and he won't
[1:08:56] listen.
[1:08:57] He said, "Oh, that was for another age,
[1:08:59] another son, some other time." That
[1:09:01] don't mean me.
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; What is that lack of maturity,
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; right? He's not ready. Not ready for the
[1:09:09] message.
[1:09:11] Come on, church. Not ready for the age
[1:09:12] he's living in.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; But a real born son that's born in the
[1:09:17] age of adoption, into the age of the
[1:09:19] opening of the word, the open book, that
[1:09:21] son is able to say, "I know he's the
[1:09:23] same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:09:26] I know it's for me. I know I can be born
[1:09:29] again. I know I can be happy. I know I
[1:09:31] can live for God. I know I can have the
[1:09:33] victory. Are you with me now?
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; I know I can have my healing
[1:09:38] now. He said, "Don't you see where the
[1:09:39] church misses its placing? Why we
[1:09:42] haven't got revivals? Why haven't we
[1:09:44] haven't got things going on? That's
[1:09:45] where it lays."
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; Right. Now, listen to me. We don't
[1:09:51] we don't necessarily need to hear
[1:09:53] something new.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; That's right. Yeah.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; To have revival,
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; we need to get back to what we do know.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; We don't necessarily need to be worked
[1:10:03] up into revival.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; Church, we need to come to a place where
[1:10:08] we believe what we have.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; Where we can be excited about what we do
[1:10:12] have.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; Well, if we just had this, that, or the
[1:10:15] other, if we just had an exciting
[1:10:17] preacher, if we just had a a great
[1:10:19] ministry come by. I appreciate exciting
[1:10:21] preaching. Never did like boring
[1:10:22] preaching myself. I don't even like my
[1:10:24] own preaching. I I but but if it's the
[1:10:26] message of the hour, we should feed on
[1:10:28] it. We should grab a hold of it. It
[1:10:31] should mean something to us. It should
[1:10:32] warm our hearts and our souls.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; Brother said that's why we don't have
[1:10:41] revivals. That's where it lays. You
[1:10:43] talked about Joshua placing the tribes.
[1:10:45] Now he'd place them where they ought to
[1:10:46] be and they were over there fraternizing
[1:10:48] with the Philistines instead of doing
[1:10:50] what they were supposed to be doing.
[1:10:53] He said, ' Don't you imagine that man,
[1:10:54] the Holy Spirit blushes before the
[1:10:56] father when he has to say that. Oh my. I
[1:10:59] told him, but he wouldn't listen. I told
[1:11:02] him and let him read it right there in
[1:11:03] the book. He said, "I had a little
[1:11:05] minister come by."
[1:11:07] So, I know I'm going slow tonight, but
[1:11:10] just bear with me for a minute. So, here
[1:11:12] was a person that would not listen to
[1:11:14] the ministry
[1:11:16] when the Holy Spirit sent a little
[1:11:18] minister.
[1:11:21] God, help me to be pliable.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; Help me to be able to learn something in
[1:11:26] church.
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; I had an old preacher one time come to
[1:11:29] church where I was the pastor at up at
[1:11:31] Bransville. And he told me one time with
[1:11:33] JT, he said, "I don't come here to learn
[1:11:34] anything."
[1:11:37] And that's exactly where he stayed.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; I was a young preacher. He was an old
[1:11:42] preacher. But he was exactly right. He
[1:11:44] didn't learn a thing.
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; But can we be little enough
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; to be mature?
[1:11:50] where we could actually come to church
[1:11:52] to learn something.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, the pastor's preaching
[1:11:55] tonight, so or maybe some other
[1:11:56] preacher's preaching tonight, so I won't
[1:11:58] learn anything." No, if you come to
[1:11:59] church with an open heart and a hungry
[1:12:01] heart, say, "Lord, feed me tonight. I
[1:12:03] want some of that alpha alpha. I want
[1:12:05] some I don't want them weeds. I want the
[1:12:07] richness of the word. I want the depth
[1:12:09] of the word. I want the truth of God.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; I don't want to just come and hear my
[1:12:14] neighbors preached on."
[1:12:16] You know, there's people, excuse me
[1:12:18] tonight, but there's people who just
[1:12:19] come to church just to pitchfork.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; The only tool that they bring to the
[1:12:27] feeding table is a pitchfork. And they
[1:12:30] just constantly throw it on somebody. I
[1:12:32] don't want to do that. I don't want to
[1:12:33] come to church just to throw it off on
[1:12:34] some brother Bill or or Brother Paul or
[1:12:37] somebody else. Lord, help me to bring a
[1:12:38] rake where I can pull it to me. Help me
[1:12:40] to be a person who who pulls it to me.
[1:12:42] He said, "Lord, let that let that become
[1:12:45] reality in my life. I don't want just
[1:12:47] everybody else to get straightened out.
[1:12:48] I want to be straightened out.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; I want to be right."
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; Well, what would our church services be
[1:12:57] like if we'd all just come like that
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; instead of disgruntled?
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; I don't even know who I'm preaching to
[1:13:03] tonight, but somebody is getting fed.
[1:13:09] people disgruntled and just, "Well, it's
[1:13:11] the same old Alpha Alpha, but isn't it
[1:13:13] Alpha Alpha?"
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; If it's the message, it is.
[1:13:18] But they wouldn't let that little
[1:13:19] minister come by and show him that Jesus
[1:13:22] Christ is the same yesterday, today, and
[1:13:24] forever. You know what? He let one of
[1:13:26] them old goat herders come over here and
[1:13:28] tell him that was for another age.
[1:13:31] Yes, sir. They sure like him over in
[1:13:33] that country, the goat herder. But I
[1:13:35] tell you, he sure don't know how to feed
[1:13:36] sheep.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; That's one thing about it. He just won't
[1:13:39] listen to me, says the Holy Spirit. I
[1:13:41] tried to tell him that you're the same
[1:13:43] yesterday, today, and forever. That he
[1:13:44] just won't do it. He's the biggest
[1:13:46] coward I ever seen in my life.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; He talked about how people would begin
[1:13:50] to pattern after television and smoking
[1:13:52] and drinking and all of those things.
[1:13:54] And oh, it was just an awful picture.
[1:13:57] It's an awful story that the Holy Ghost
[1:13:59] had to tell the father.
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:14:03] But then he changed the picture. He
[1:14:05] said, "Now let's change the picture."
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; Now the father, his son is a good boy.
[1:14:10] His father right along. Here's a tutor.
[1:14:12] The Holy Spirit, which which way the
[1:14:15] Holy Spirit, he said, I'm going to walk.
[1:14:18] So look at the difference in the
[1:14:20] attitude.
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; The one said, "You're not going to teach
[1:14:23] me nothing."
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; But here comes one who says, "Lord,
[1:14:27] wherever you walk, that's where I want
[1:14:30] to walk." How many could have that
[1:14:31] attitude tonight? Wherever you walk,
[1:14:33] Lord, wherever you whatever you decide
[1:14:35] to bring me, that's what I want. I want
[1:14:38] to be changed. I want to be mature. I
[1:14:40] want to I want to grow to full age. I
[1:14:42] want to come to my potential as a son or
[1:14:44] daughter of God.
[1:14:47] My family needs healing. The people
[1:14:50] around me, I don't have time to squabble
[1:14:52] and fuss and fight and pick at preachers
[1:14:54] and pick at deacons and pick at song
[1:14:56] leaders and pick at the church. I I
[1:14:58] don't have time for that. There's
[1:15:00] healing in that's needed in my family.
[1:15:02] There there's salvation that's needed in
[1:15:04] my children. I need something from you,
[1:15:06] Lord. Let me become a full son or
[1:15:09] daughter of God. Let me grow into this
[1:15:11] age of adoption so that I can be
[1:15:13] everything you want me to be and I can
[1:15:15] speak to my mountains cuz they're big.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; They're in my way and I need to be able
[1:15:20] to speak to them.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; So, how do I do that? I learn to walk
[1:15:27] with the Holy Spirit. Yes.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; I feel his presence here tonight. Let's
[1:15:35] just walk with him for a minute.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh, I'll go right with you."
[1:15:42] Oh, the hill is awful high, son. I'll go
[1:15:44] right with you. I got confidence in you.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:52] This message didn't take me away from
[1:15:54] the Holy Spirit. It gave me confidence
[1:15:56] in the Holy Spirit.
[1:15:58] And people say, "Well, be we're beyond
[1:16:00] the age of a tutor. I still need the
[1:16:02] Holy Ghost
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; to lead me and to guide me. I've not
[1:16:06] come to the fullness of my adoption till
[1:16:09] I get that body change. I need him."
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; The child said, "I'll walk right with
[1:16:15] you. I'll go right with you. Oh, the
[1:16:17] hill is awful high, son. But I got
[1:16:20] confidence in you. If I start getting
[1:16:22] tired, he'll raise my hand up and hold
[1:16:24] me on. But there's lions up on the hill
[1:16:27] there. Don't matter as long as you're
[1:16:29] around.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:16:34] Don't make a bit of difference. I'll
[1:16:36] face whatever needs to be faced. I'll go
[1:16:38] wherever you want me to go. I'll do
[1:16:40] whatever needs to be done.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; Cuz I'm walking with the Holy Spirit.
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; God, give me that kind of confidence
[1:16:47] today. Don't matter as long as you're
[1:16:49] around. Don't make a bit of difference.
[1:16:50] I'm walking right along with you. Yes.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; See the boy, he couldn't get his eyes on
[1:16:57] what his neighbor was doing, what
[1:16:59] somebody else was doing. Just let me
[1:17:00] walk with the Holy Spirit.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; Don't get my eyes on the church down the
[1:17:04] road.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; Such a danger in our day and age. Don't
[1:17:09] get my eyes on what's not being done or
[1:17:12] what is being done or what somebody else
[1:17:14] could do better. Lord, let me walk with
[1:17:16] you.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; Let me walk with you.
[1:17:20] Hallelujah. Remember when when when when
[1:17:22] the spirit of God spoke to brother
[1:17:23] Brandham, he said, "Walk with me and he
[1:17:26] be to walk with him and pretty soon his
[1:17:28] body changed."
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What was it? A prefigure of
[1:17:33] the rapture. He said, "I looked at
[1:17:35] myself and I realized here was a a
[1:17:37] 20-year-old man again. Don't you realize
[1:17:39] that if we walk with the Holy Spirit one
[1:17:41] of these days, hallelujah, we're going
[1:17:43] to reach the fullness of our adoption."
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:17:50] So, there's trouble up there. It's slick
[1:17:52] rocks. I don't care as long as you're
[1:17:55] holding my hand.
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; I'll walk right with you. I'll walk
[1:17:58] right with you. Oh, you know what? Your
[1:18:00] dad used to do that. Glory to God. Oh,
[1:18:03] he had the same attitude. He said,
[1:18:05] "Whatever the father does, I do.
[1:18:08] Wherever he goes, that's where I go. Get
[1:18:10] up on top of the hill there." He said,
[1:18:12] "You know what, Father? Your son is just
[1:18:14] like a chip off the old block."
[1:18:17] Hallelujah. He's absolutely exactly like
[1:18:21] you.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, that's what I want the
[1:18:24] report to be tonight. Your son is just
[1:18:26] like you. When he's reviled, he reviles
[1:18:29] not again. When he's cursed, he
[1:18:31] threatens not. No matter what happens to
[1:18:32] him, he's not afraid. He's going on
[1:18:35] anyway. He's walking with the Holy
[1:18:36] Spirit, the dove leading the lamb. He is
[1:18:40] absolutely exactly like you. Every word
[1:18:43] that you say, he says amen to it. How
[1:18:45] many can say amen to that tonight? Every
[1:18:48] word that he says, I got confidence.
[1:18:50] It's the word of God. He I I I'm a chip
[1:18:53] off the old block. I can say absolutely
[1:18:55] amen to every word of God.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; I had him turn over in the Bible the
[1:19:01] other day and said, "Jesus Christ the
[1:19:02] same yesterday, today, and forever." You
[1:19:04] know what he said? He screamed, throwed
[1:19:06] his hands up in the air, and said,
[1:19:07] "Hallelujah."
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; Wonder how many sons we've got that have
[1:19:13] reached full age.
[1:19:15] reach the age of maturity can say amen
[1:19:18] to every word of God.
[1:19:20] You know it said here in your word, you
[1:19:22] know where you said the works he that
[1:19:23] believeth on me, the works that I do
[1:19:25] shall he do also. Yeah. I remember
[1:19:27] writing that to my son.
[1:19:29] Oh, when he saw that, he just screamed
[1:19:31] and jumped up and down, hollered.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; He wasn't just dancing with music.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; What was he doing? The word thrilled
[1:19:40] him.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, let the word thrill me.
[1:19:44] I know those people claim to have all of
[1:19:45] the word and they're dead as a doornail.
[1:19:47] Listen, if you just listen to what
[1:19:48] you're reading, if you'll just run that
[1:19:50] through your brain a little bit and get
[1:19:52] a picture of what you're talking about,
[1:19:54] it it'll it'll bring an excitement to
[1:19:56] your soul. It'll bring a a bounce to
[1:19:58] your step. It'll bring a dance to your
[1:20:00] feet. It'll bring an amen out of your
[1:20:02] lips.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; Why? Because you realize it's God that's
[1:20:06] speaking. You got confidence in the
[1:20:07] message. You haven't had a preacher
[1:20:08] minister questions to you.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; But somebody who believes the message.
[1:20:13] Well, that's a refreshing thought, isn't
[1:20:15] it? Well, don't you want somebody to
[1:20:16] preach to you that actually believes the
[1:20:18] message of the hour? Actually believes
[1:20:20] God means what he says,
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; sir.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; Take all the world out of me,
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; oh God. Oh, could we make that our cry
[1:20:30] tonight? Take all the world out of me,
[1:20:33] Lord. I want to say amen to every word.
[1:20:35] Take the world out of take away the
[1:20:36] bitterness and the strife and the
[1:20:38] fussing and the fighting and the
[1:20:39] backbiting. Make me a child of God. Take
[1:20:42] away the worldliness. Take away the the
[1:20:44] the the dress and the and the fashion
[1:20:46] and the and the smoking and the drink.
[1:20:48] Whatever it is of the world, let me take
[1:20:50] it. Let me get it out of me.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; Remember what brother Brandham said.
[1:20:54] When you apply the token, I'm connecting
[1:20:57] those two things for a reason. Because
[1:20:58] brother Brandham does in desperation
[1:21:01] connects adoption to the token
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; and and actually talks about how oh God
[1:21:07] there was something more than just
[1:21:09] saying I have the Holy Ghost. But but
[1:21:11] it's living that life and having that
[1:21:12] token on display. He said, "Clean your
[1:21:14] house out and apply the token to your
[1:21:17] family."
[1:21:19] Oh, the father said, "I'm happy for
[1:21:21] that, son. That's a fine son." All
[1:21:24] right, keep an eye on him for a few
[1:21:26] years. See how he comes on, how he
[1:21:28] progresses after a while. The years pass
[1:21:30] by. How's he getting along? Oh my, he's
[1:21:33] even growing in grace. Oh my, he's
[1:21:36] shelling the woods.
[1:21:38] I had to look that up
[1:21:42] because I thought, brother Brandham, I
[1:21:43] thought, well, I first thought that
[1:21:44] they'd put the put that in there wrong
[1:21:46] and it's not. It's what he says. As far
[1:21:48] as I can tell, it's shelling the woods.
[1:21:50] And I thought, well, maybe that's an
[1:21:51] expression I don't understand. So, I
[1:21:52] went and looked it up. What's a military
[1:21:54] term?
[1:21:56] It means, as far as best of my ability
[1:21:59] to look it up, it said that it means
[1:22:01] that uh he hit every target.
[1:22:04] Because when you shell the woods, what
[1:22:06] they would do, the military would shell
[1:22:07] the woods and all the all the splinters
[1:22:10] would come off and hit everybody.
[1:22:12] So that somebody else got a better
[1:22:14] explanation of that, but Gabe, you get
[1:22:16] with me later.
[1:22:18] She shell in the woods. I thought that
[1:22:21] just hitting every target.
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, I want to do that. Don't you?
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; He takes them sheep, can handle them
[1:22:26] just like
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; you do.
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, God, give us pastors after the heart
[1:22:32] of God. preachers in ministry after the
[1:22:35] heart of God. I don't want and I I
[1:22:37] really care about that, church. I don't
[1:22:39] I'm not just saying that. I'm not I'm
[1:22:41] I'm I'm being a little vulnerable with
[1:22:42] you and a little bit open, but I really
[1:22:44] care about that. I realize I'm human. I
[1:22:45] realize I can come across wrong to
[1:22:47] people. I realize I can do things and
[1:22:49] say things that that might turn people
[1:22:51] off and and and turn them against even
[1:22:53] what I'm trying to say. I don't want to
[1:22:55] do that. I want to be somebody who feeds
[1:22:58] the sheep just like he feeds the sheep.
[1:23:00] who cares for the sheep just like he
[1:23:02] cares for the sheep.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; God, help me to do that with all my
[1:23:05] humanity and all my uh inability, but
[1:23:08] let me care like you care. Lord, I think
[1:23:12] if we all had that attitude, things
[1:23:13] would begin to change and we begin to
[1:23:15] look at one another differently. You
[1:23:17] see, we're trying to do our best to feed
[1:23:19] the sheep the way God would have the the
[1:23:21] sheep fed. We're trying to do our best
[1:23:22] to protect them and keep them in the
[1:23:24] shelter.
[1:23:28] handle them just like he handled the
[1:23:29] sheep.
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; He'll never give them seaweeds. He'll
[1:23:35] never give them iron weeds. In fact,
[1:23:37] he'd said he feeds them Acts 238.
[1:23:42] Oh, he said, "Does he really say that?"
[1:23:44] Yes, sir. He sure does. Well, that's
[1:23:45] just the way I wrote it. Well, that's
[1:23:47] just the way he says it.
[1:23:49] Some of them said, "Tear you in the city
[1:23:51] of Jerusalem to your end with power."
[1:23:53] And he said when he read that he
[1:23:54] hollered, "Hallelujah. That's what you
[1:23:56] need." You know what he does? He just
[1:23:58] gets them right down there till they get
[1:23:59] it. That's all right. Stays right with
[1:24:01] them. And if they start fussing, he
[1:24:03] says, "Whoop whoop whoop. Wait a minute.
[1:24:06] That's the way goats act, not sheep."
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; In fact, brother Brandon said they get a
[1:24:11] little peeved.
[1:24:12] But he knows how to handle sheep.
[1:24:16] Amen. Said, "You know what?" And I I'm
[1:24:19] not taking that even as a pastor, but I
[1:24:21] believe our prophet in this age, God
[1:24:23] gifted him to handle the sheep, right?
[1:24:25] So grateful for that. He said, "You know
[1:24:28] what? I've seen Archbishop so and so
[1:24:30] tell him that he couldn't come to this
[1:24:31] town and hold a meeting." Brother Brand
[1:24:33] was getting personal now. He said, "But
[1:24:35] you know, I kind of let him." I said,
[1:24:36] "Go anyhow. Withdraw these tapes. Don't
[1:24:38] you let them go out. We went anyhow." He
[1:24:40] talked about that how they would oppose
[1:24:41] the meetings. He said, "But you know
[1:24:42] what?" He went right on down there
[1:24:44] anyway. Went right on down there and
[1:24:45] began to throw out alpha alpha. You know
[1:24:47] what? them sheep started eating and
[1:24:48] they're getting as fat as they can be.
[1:24:50] Well, glory to God.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. While they're having healings
[1:24:53] and meetings and a lot of them young
[1:24:55] fellows began, he said, "Well, they
[1:24:56] seen." I like this. A lot of them young
[1:24:59] fellows.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; Brother Bisll was a young fellow during
[1:25:02] this time.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; Brother Perry Green was a young fellow.
[1:25:05] Some of the brothers were young fellows.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad men like Eddie Bis, I know
[1:25:10] we've talked about him a lot lately, he
[1:25:11] just passed away. I'm glad men like
[1:25:12] Eddie Bisll chose to feed Alpha. Yes,
[1:25:16] sir.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; So, somebody would have the strength to
[1:25:18] feed another generation. I'm glad I got
[1:25:20] to eat alpha alpha so I can feed people
[1:25:23] alpha alpha.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; They got a big bunch of hay like that
[1:25:25] alpha alpha. You know what they done
[1:25:27] with it? It was so good till they run
[1:25:28] over to the neighbors and said, "Taste
[1:25:30] this. Taste this. Taste this." That's
[1:25:33] what happened. They took the message to
[1:25:35] the world.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; See, the atmosphere there tasted just
[1:25:40] like this right here. Other words, the
[1:25:42] atmosphere in the meeting was like
[1:25:44] heaven. Here it is. Right there. Right
[1:25:47] there it is. See, repent.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; Be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:25:50] It's for whosoever will, let him come to
[1:25:52] see what the Bible said. See, and
[1:25:53] they're just having a great time down
[1:25:55] there. Oh, that's my son. That's my boy.
[1:25:57] Well, you think he's well matured? Sure
[1:25:59] do, said the Holy Spirit. I've given him
[1:26:01] tests. Boy, I tried him this way, tried
[1:26:02] him that way. I've thrown him sick. I
[1:26:04] put him under. I stomped him. I let the
[1:26:06] devil do everything to him he could do.
[1:26:08] He'd come right back up again.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; He'd come just the same. Come up again.
[1:26:12] I made him sick. I done this. I threw
[1:26:14] him in the hospital. I took him out
[1:26:15] there. I done this. I done that. I
[1:26:16] turned his wife against him. I turned
[1:26:18] his neighbors against him. I turned
[1:26:19] everything.
[1:26:21] Oh, God. Brother Bram's talking about a
[1:26:24] little bit of his own life there, too.
[1:26:26] He said, "That didn't make a bit of
[1:26:28] difference." Said, "Though he slay me,
[1:26:30] yet I'll trust him.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; I killed his family.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; I took this. I did this. I done all
[1:26:35] this.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; I did this, that, and the other." Still,
[1:26:37] he stood right up. Though he slay me,
[1:26:39] yet I'll serve him. He's mine.
[1:26:41] He said, "Oh, well, I believe we ought
[1:26:42] to call him out somewhere to a little
[1:26:44] special place
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; and have an adoption." You begin to see
[1:26:48] what adoption is.
[1:26:54] He said, "Now, when the father in the
[1:26:55] Old Testament," I'll just get this and
[1:26:56] we'll we'll close. He said, 'Wh the
[1:26:59] father of the Old Testament understood
[1:27:00] their son was come of age and been
[1:27:01] seasoned out unto adoption unto he said
[1:27:05] they're born a child but they're they're
[1:27:07] a son right then but then they'll never
[1:27:08] be no more than just a child just an
[1:27:11] ordinary son until they mature and show
[1:27:13] what they are then he calls him out then
[1:27:16] he said now when the church gets to that
[1:27:19] place he says Manassus you belong over
[1:27:22] here Ephraim you over here you see why
[1:27:25] church order matters
[1:27:28] Right? All of those things, brother
[1:27:29] Brandon ties that in this same sermon to
[1:27:31] adoption.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; Church order matters. All these things
[1:27:35] that we have, the you say communion, the
[1:27:37] way we have communion, it matters. It
[1:27:40] matters to have a man standing in the
[1:27:41] pulpit preaching the word. I Why,
[1:27:43] brother Ben? I don't know. Because God
[1:27:45] said so.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; And we got to be mature enough to
[1:27:50] receive it.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; Just say, Lord, whatever you want,
[1:27:53] that's what I want.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; Then he takes him out to a certain
[1:27:56] place. The father does. He sets him on a
[1:27:57] high place and he has a ceremony and
[1:27:59] they all come around. He said, "I want
[1:28:00] everyone to know this is my child. I
[1:28:02] adopt my son a special dress on him and
[1:28:06] I I want you to know that his name is
[1:28:07] just as good on any check as my name is.
[1:28:10] He's my child. I adopt him into my
[1:28:12] family. Although he's been my son since
[1:28:13] he was born, since he received the Holy
[1:28:15] Ghost, he's been my son. But now I'm
[1:28:17] going to place him positionally in
[1:28:19] authority. What he fires is fired. What
[1:28:21] he hires is hired." And he references
[1:28:23] Mark 11:23.
[1:28:24] If you say to this mountain, be removed
[1:28:27] and cast into the sea. Amen. Brother
[1:28:29] Brandham takes that to Mount
[1:28:30] Transfiguration, Matthew 17. You can
[1:28:32] read that. Maybe we'll read that if we
[1:28:34] pick it up on Sunday.
[1:28:38] Brother Brandham says, I'm going to skip
[1:28:40] down one. He talked about Peter and
[1:28:42] glorification. He said, now there's
[1:28:44] where God is trying to get the
[1:28:45] Pentecostal church in the book of
[1:28:48] Ephesians.
[1:28:49] See, they'd come to a certain place when
[1:28:52] it was time to grow up, and they weren't
[1:28:54] grown up, but there would be a bride who
[1:28:57] would come to a full maturity. He said,
[1:29:00] "You were first born into the kingdom by
[1:29:01] the Holy Ghost." How many knows that?
[1:29:03] The next, you're predestinated unto
[1:29:04] what? Adoption. What is that? You're
[1:29:06] predestinated unto the placing. Can I
[1:29:09] say this? Your spiritual gene is all
[1:29:11] God.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; So, I don't want you to be worried about
[1:29:14] this. You say, "Well, what if I never
[1:29:16] mature?"
[1:29:17] You're a chip off the old block,
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; right? If you're born again, you're a
[1:29:22] spiritual gene of God.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; And this is the age of adoption.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; So there's there's no
[1:29:29] how can I put this? The only part of you
[1:29:32] that isn't a gene of God is the flesh.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; Do you know that the the gene seed
[1:29:38] itself, the spiritual part is completely
[1:29:41] God,
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; right? It come directly from his mind.
[1:29:44] So there's no mixture there. It can't be
[1:29:46] nothing but God.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; Right? So, if you got a a husband and
[1:29:50] wife got married, he'd have his genes
[1:29:52] and her jeans and you'd say, "Well, what
[1:29:54] if they turn out like their mother?
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; What if they turn out like their
[1:29:59] father?" But you can't do that because
[1:30:01] your mother is the word. Your father is
[1:30:04] the word.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; He spoke you in, hallelujah, into
[1:30:08] existence. That's why brother Brand
[1:30:09] makes the point so strong. Jesus was
[1:30:11] formed in the womb of Mary. It wasn't
[1:30:14] any part of Mary,
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; but he made both the blood cell and the
[1:30:17] egg.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; Adoption, what is it? It's you becoming
[1:30:22] what you are on the inside. So, the only
[1:30:24] part of you that's not there yet is
[1:30:27] this.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; And he's going to bring it to a place
[1:30:30] where this on the inside controls this
[1:30:32] on the outside.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; And one day, we're at an appointed time.
[1:30:36] We're going to come to a place where the
[1:30:38] fullness of adoption comes in.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Which is the change of our
[1:30:42] bodies.
[1:30:43] Because our natural gene is not God.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; Our natural gene is our parents and goes
[1:30:49] back to Eden to the fall. But our
[1:30:51] spiritual gene is God. So corruption
[1:30:53] cannot inherit incorruption. We must be
[1:30:56] changed.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In a moment, in the
[1:30:59] twinkling of an eye. For we know
[1:31:01] musicians go ahead and come. We know.
[1:31:04] Paul says that the whole creation
[1:31:05] groanth and travaleth in pain together
[1:31:08] until now.
[1:31:10] Not only they, but ourselves also, which
[1:31:13] have the first fruits of the spirit. We
[1:31:16] have the earnest of the spirit. We have
[1:31:18] the down payment on a future home, but
[1:31:21] we're not there yet.
[1:31:25] That's why we have misunderstandings and
[1:31:27] things happen. But church, don't get
[1:31:29] your mind on that.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; Keep your mind on this adoption,
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; on this change of the body, on this
[1:31:34] rapture age, on the shout that we heard,
[1:31:38] on the message of the hour.
[1:31:40] Amen.
[1:31:42] See, because he said, "We which have the
[1:31:44] first fruits of the spirit, even we
[1:31:46] ourselves
[1:31:48] grown within ourselves,
[1:31:52] waiting for the adoption
[1:31:56] to or which is the redemption
[1:31:59] of our body." Brother Brandham calls
[1:32:02] that the fullness of adoption.
[1:32:06] We could say it like this. As I've said
[1:32:08] before, we are saved. How many believe
[1:32:10] you're saved? That's all right. You
[1:32:12] believe you've been born again. I'm so
[1:32:14] glad of that. But you're also being
[1:32:17] saved.
[1:32:18] Did you know that? You're not only
[1:32:21] saved, but you're being saved.
[1:32:24] And you will be saved.
[1:32:27] So redemption is not just a past event,
[1:32:29] it's a present event.
[1:32:32] His blood is still effective. If I make
[1:32:34] a mistake, if I do something that's
[1:32:36] wrong, I have an advocate with the
[1:32:38] father. Aren't you glad for that today?
[1:32:42] We are saved. We are being saved, but we
[1:32:46] will be saved
[1:32:49] in a moment, in a twinkling of an eye.
[1:32:52] We shall not all sleep, Paul says, but
[1:32:54] we shall all be changed.
[1:32:58] Oh, aren't you glad for that promise?
[1:33:00] Romans 8:21 says, "Because the creature
[1:33:03] or the creation itself
[1:33:06] also shall be delivered." Hallelujah.
[1:33:09] I've been delivered. My soul is free.
[1:33:11] I've been brought out of the depths of
[1:33:13] sin. I know what he did for me. How many
[1:33:15] can testify to that tonight? I know
[1:33:17] where I am. I know where I've come from,
[1:33:19] but I know that there's still a
[1:33:20] deliverance that's got to take place in
[1:33:22] my body. That's why sometimes it's hard.
[1:33:24] The word is hard on me, but I listen to
[1:33:26] it anyway. Sometimes it's skins to hide,
[1:33:29] but I believe it anyway. Sometimes it
[1:33:31] seems like I'm being picked on, but I
[1:33:33] still love him anyway because the
[1:33:36] creation itself shall be delivered.
[1:33:40] Hallelujah. From the bondage of
[1:33:42] corruption into the glorious liberty.
[1:33:46] Hallelujah. The way my soul was
[1:33:48] delivered, my body will be delivered
[1:33:51] into the glorious liberty of the
[1:33:54] children of God. What do we do? Say,
[1:33:56] "Brother Ben, what do we do?" Believe
[1:33:57] the message.
[1:34:00] Have confidence in it. Get the token.
[1:34:03] That's the Holy Ghost in our in the word
[1:34:05] age. The token, the ticket, right? Be
[1:34:08] born with the true baptism of the Holy
[1:34:10] Ghost. What does that do? That's your
[1:34:12] ticket to heaven. That's your seal.
[1:34:14] Are you with me now? Put it on display.
[1:34:18] Walk with the word. God will take care
[1:34:20] of the rest.
[1:34:22] Do you believe him tonight? Do you love
[1:34:23] him? Amen.
[1:34:26] Let's just bow our heads and talk to him
[1:34:28] for a moment. I I hope it's made some
[1:34:30] sort of sense tonight. I
[1:34:34] thought about it and studied for a long
[1:34:36] time and
[1:34:38] got away and tried to clear my head over
[1:34:40] the last few days thinking about these
[1:34:42] things. I know so much has been said
[1:34:44] about adoption pro and con and some like
[1:34:48] it don't even matter, but I believe it
[1:34:49] fits right in with all the rest of the
[1:34:50] message of the hour.
[1:34:53] It's just part of what we believe.
[1:34:56] What do we want to do? If you never
[1:34:57] received the baptism of the Holy Ghost,
[1:34:59] this is the time to be desperate for the
[1:35:01] token. That's your ticket out of here.
[1:35:04] If you have been born again, if you have
[1:35:08] received the token, it's time to let the
[1:35:09] Holy Ghost teach you, guide you into all
[1:35:12] truth as he promised he would do. Amen.
[1:35:16] Let's just talk to him. Heavenly Father,
[1:35:18] Lord Jesus, I'm so thankful for the
[1:35:20] promise of your word. So thankful for
[1:35:23] your love, Lord, that goes beyond our
[1:35:26] flesh,
[1:35:28] goes beyond the outer man, the the
[1:35:31] creature itself.
[1:35:33] Oh God,
[1:35:35] I thank you for that.
[1:35:38] Lord, I know I've been delivered, but
[1:35:40] someday my body will be delivered from
[1:35:43] pain and from sickness.
[1:35:46] The bodies of these elders that are
[1:35:48] sitting here tonight will be delivered
[1:35:50] into the glorious liberty of the
[1:35:52] children of God.
[1:35:55] Maybe some would like to feel like they
[1:35:56] felt when they were 21, but won't even
[1:35:59] be like that. It'll be so much more than
[1:36:01] that. In a place where there are no
[1:36:03] contradictions,
[1:36:05] Lord, where there's no wondering, no
[1:36:07] worry.
[1:36:09] Oh God, where we'll where we'll know as
[1:36:12] we are known.
[1:36:15] Oh, where we'll we we'll be learning
[1:36:17] about you, Lord, through all eternity.
[1:36:21] Lord, we thank you for a promise that
[1:36:23] we'll come to that place. Lord, there's
[1:36:26] something in our hearts that longs for
[1:36:28] it. We see the corruption of this world.
[1:36:30] The world's falling apart, but Lord,
[1:36:33] it's time for the sons of God to come
[1:36:36] under the full authority of the word of
[1:36:38] God to come under the message of the
[1:36:40] hour and become fullborn, full-blown
[1:36:44] sons and daughters of God. I pray you'd
[1:36:46] help us tonight, Lord. I pray that you
[1:36:48] just move in in a mighty way. You'd
[1:36:51] bring a reality to us, Lord, in our
[1:36:53] lives, God. If there's
[1:36:57] any spirit of fear, I pray that it would
[1:36:59] be cast out tonight, Lord, as I'm
[1:37:02] lingering tonight and I just feel in my
[1:37:04] heart, Lord, maybe it's me tonight, but
[1:37:06] Lord, I I want to be right. I I don't
[1:37:09] want to go to church with the wrong
[1:37:10] attitude. I want to live for you and I I
[1:37:13] want to receive of the word of God. Help
[1:37:15] me, Lord. Help each one, oh God. We want
[1:37:18] to eat that alpha alpha, Lord. We want
[1:37:20] to feed that alpha alpha to your
[1:37:22] children. That's what we want to do. I
[1:37:25] pray you'd grant it tonight. We thank
[1:37:26] you for all that you've done for us. We
[1:37:28] thank you for healing and for the
[1:37:30] salvation of our children, Lord, for
[1:37:33] everything that we have need of in Jesus
[1:37:35] name. Amen. Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[1:37:41] Hallelujah.
[1:37:44] Thank you, Lord.
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; Where would I be?
[1:37:49] You only know.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; If you need prayer, the altar's open
[1:37:54] tonight.
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; See
[1:37:58] through eyes
[1:38:00] of love.
[1:38:02] It was a hopeless case.
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; I was an empty place
[1:38:12] if not for grace. Hallelujah.
[1:38:16] Oh, amazing grace.
[1:38:19] Hallelujah.
[1:38:21] How sweet the sound. If anyone else
[1:38:24] wants to come and pray, you're welcome
[1:38:26] to come.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; Lost,
[1:38:29] but now I'm found.
[1:38:34] I was a hopeless case,
[1:38:38] an empty
[1:38:40] place
[1:38:43] if not for grace.
[1:38:47] Oh precious Lord,
[1:38:52] please take
[1:38:54] my hand.
[1:38:56] Oh, lead me on
[1:39:01] and let me stand.
[1:39:05] I was a hopeless case,
[1:39:10] an empty
[1:39:12] place.
[1:39:14] If not for grace,
[1:39:19] where would I be?
[1:39:23] You only
[1:39:25] know.
[1:39:27] You only see
[1:39:32] through eyes
[1:39:34] of love.
[1:39:36] I was a hopeless case
[1:39:41] and indeed
[1:39:43] place
[1:39:45] if not for grace.
[1:39:50] Oh precious Lord,
[1:39:54] please take
[1:39:56] my hand.
[1:39:59] Won't you lead me on
[1:40:03] and let me stand?
[1:40:07] I was a hopeless case,
[1:40:12] an empty
[1:40:14] place.
[1:40:16] If not
[1:40:18] for grace,
[1:40:20] [Music]
[1:40:21] well, I'm no longer
[1:40:25] slave
[1:40:26] to fear.
[1:40:31] I am
[1:40:33] a child
[1:40:35] of God.
[1:40:37] [Music]
[1:40:39] Well, I'm no longer
[1:40:42] a slave
[1:40:44] to fear.
[1:40:48] I am
[1:40:50] a child
[1:40:53] of God.
[1:40:55] [Music]
[1:40:57] You unravel me
[1:41:01] with a mey.
[1:41:06] You surround me with
[1:41:10] a song
[1:41:14] of deliverance
[1:41:18] from my eneies
[1:41:23] till all my fears
[1:41:28] are gone.
[1:41:31] Well, I'm no longer
[1:41:34] a slave
[1:41:36] to free.
[1:41:41] I am
[1:41:43] a child
[1:41:45] of God.
[1:41:47] Oh, I'm no longer
[1:41:52] a slave
[1:41:54] to fear.
[1:41:58] And I am
[1:42:00] a child
[1:42:02] of God.
[1:42:06] From my mother's womb,
[1:42:10] you have chosen me.
[1:42:16] Love has called
[1:42:19] my name
[1:42:23] and I've been born again
[1:42:28] into your family.
[1:42:33] Your blood flows through
[1:42:36] my veins
[1:42:40] and I'm no longer
[1:42:43] a slave.
[1:42:46] to fear.
[1:42:50] I am
[1:42:52] a child
[1:42:54] of God.
[1:42:57] Oh, I'm no longer
[1:43:00] a slave
[1:43:03] to fear.
[1:43:07] I am
[1:43:09] the child
[1:43:11] of God.
[1:43:14] [Music]
[1:43:16] You split the sea so I could walk right
[1:43:22] through it.
[1:43:25] My fears were drowned in perfect
[1:43:29] love.
[1:43:31] [Music]
[1:43:33] You rescued me so I could stand and
[1:43:39] sing.
[1:43:40] I am
[1:43:42] a child
[1:43:45] of God.
[1:43:47] Well, I'm no longer
[1:43:51] a slave
[1:43:53] to fear. Tonight, I'm not a slave. I'm a
[1:43:56] child of God. I am a child
[1:44:02] of God. Sing it now. Lift your hands to
[1:44:04] him. Oh, I'm no longer
[1:44:08] slain. Hallelujah.
[1:44:10] To fear.
[1:44:13] Oh, I am
[1:44:16] a child
[1:44:18] of God.
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; Of God.
[1:44:21] Well, I Hallelujah. No longer.
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, slave
[1:44:27] to fear.
[1:44:29] Do you believe it tonight?
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, yes. I
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, I am
[1:44:34] a child
[1:44:36] of God.
[1:44:38] Oh, I'm no longer
[1:44:42] a slave
[1:44:44] to fear.
[1:44:48] Oh, I am
[1:44:51] a child
[1:44:53] of God.
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; God.
[1:44:56] I love it when our young people respond
[1:44:58] to the word.
[1:45:02] Something I prayed about for years here
[1:45:04] at the church. See your response to the
[1:45:08] word. And not that you folks don't. You
[1:45:10] love the word. I know that you do. But
[1:45:13] the altar is not just a place for
[1:45:15] sinners.
[1:45:16] The altar is a place for Christians.
[1:45:20] Do you realize the mindfield that we're
[1:45:23] leading our children through in the age
[1:45:25] that we live in?
[1:45:27] There's death on every hand,
[1:45:29] destruction,
[1:45:30] trouble. I don't mean to scare you, but
[1:45:32] it's just like it's just like Moses'
[1:45:35] mother putting that baby in a vessel and
[1:45:38] pushing it out into the ocean, out into
[1:45:41] the Nile River. He's floating down. But
[1:45:44] I believe there's protection.
[1:45:47] We ought to pray for those children
[1:45:49] every day. I know that you do. But I'm
[1:45:53] just encouraging you tonight.
[1:45:55] Pray for them every day.
[1:46:00] I pray there would be revival breakout
[1:46:02] among our children because we need it.
[1:46:06] Us adults need it.
[1:46:09] We need to get serious about the
[1:46:10] message. We need to come to a place
[1:46:12] where we say, "Lord, I want to be a
[1:46:14] fullg grown son of daughter of God. I
[1:46:16] want to love it with all of my heart."
[1:46:18] See, so many fall by the wayside cuz
[1:46:20] they never got serious about it. It was
[1:46:22] just something they did that they was
[1:46:24] okay for a while. It felt good, but and
[1:46:26] they went on. But I'm invested by the
[1:46:28] steward of the message of the hour. This
[1:46:30] is all my life. This is all I have.
[1:46:32] Let's let's let's give it our all. Why
[1:46:35] don't we do that? Give it our all. Lord,
[1:46:38] I I I'm going to do everything I can to
[1:46:40] help the young people, and I'm going to
[1:46:41] help everything I can to help the
[1:46:42] elders, and I'm gonna help everything I
[1:46:44] can do everything I can to see revival
[1:46:47] come. We believe we're children of God,
[1:46:49] we believe we're predestined, but
[1:46:51] because we are predestined, we are
[1:46:53] predestinated to the adoption of sons to
[1:46:56] being mature Christians.
[1:46:58] Oh, I believe that
[1:47:01] Satan's laid every trap in the world for
[1:47:02] our children. We ought to stand there
[1:47:04] and say, "Devil, you can't have them.
[1:47:08] Some of you elders say, "Well, I don't
[1:47:10] have any children or grandchildren in
[1:47:11] this church." You ought to pray for them
[1:47:12] anyhow.
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; You might go by way of the grave, and I
[1:47:16] don't know, I may. But these young
[1:47:18] people, somebody's going to see a
[1:47:20] rapture.
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; We ought to pray all that much more as
[1:47:23] time passes on. Brother Paul, help our
[1:47:25] young people.
[1:47:27] God, keep them tender.
[1:47:32] I want to see them get hard. I want to
[1:47:34] see them keep seeking the Lord with all
[1:47:36] of their heart.
[1:47:39] And one day there's going to be a group
[1:47:40] that'll seek him with all their heart.
[1:47:41] And one by one across the world, they'll
[1:47:45] wake up one morning and start seeing
[1:47:47] their their loved ones that have already
[1:47:49] died.
[1:47:50] The dead in Christ will rise first, and
[1:47:52] we which are alive and remain
[1:47:55] shall be caught up together with them to
[1:47:57] meet our Lord in the air. What a
[1:47:58] glorious time. It ought to be the theme
[1:48:00] of the hour.
[1:48:03] We shouldn't lose focus on that. Let's
[1:48:06] keep our priorities straight. And sorry
[1:48:08] for holding you long on a Wednesday
[1:48:10] night, but I his presence is here. Do
[1:48:12] you love him tonight? Hallelujah. I am a
[1:48:16] child
[1:48:18] of God. I'm no longer Oh, I'm no longer
[1:48:24] a slave
[1:48:27] to fear.
[1:48:28] Oh, thank you, Lord Jesus. Oh, I am a
[1:48:33] child
[1:48:36] of God. I like this verse. From my
[1:48:38] mother's womb. From my mother's womb.
[1:48:44] You have chosen me. Just raise your
[1:48:47] hands to him and sing that before we go.
[1:48:49] Love has
[1:48:52] called my name.
[1:48:55] Hallelujah. Oh, I've been born again.
[1:49:01] into your family.
[1:49:04] Hallelujah.
[1:49:06] Oh, your blood flows through. Oh, thank
[1:49:10] you, Jesus. Do you believe it tonight?
[1:49:12] I'm no longer I'm no longer
[1:49:17] a slave
[1:49:19] to fear. Hallelujah. Oh, thank you,
[1:49:22] Jesus. I am
[1:49:25] a child
[1:49:27] of God. Oh, I'm no longer
[1:49:34] a slave
[1:49:36] to fear. Thank you, Lord. Oh, I am
[1:49:42] a child
[1:49:44] of God. You split the sea. Sing it now.
[1:49:48] Oh,
[1:49:50] you split the sea so I could walk right
[1:49:55] through it. Glory. All my fears were
[1:49:59] drowned in perfect love.
[1:50:05] Oh, you rescued me so I could stand and
[1:50:12] sing.
[1:50:14] Oh, I am a child
[1:50:18] of God. Sing that part again. You split
[1:50:20] the sea. Oh yes, you split the sea. so I
[1:50:26] could walk right through it. Aren't you
[1:50:30] glad he made a way for you? My fears
[1:50:32] were drowned in per love. Hallelujah.
[1:50:37] God bless you tonight. Oh, you rescued
[1:50:41] me so I could stand and sing.

[1:50:49] a child
[1:50:51] of God.

[1:50:58] slave
[1:50:59] to fear.

[1:51:06] a child
[1:51:08] of God.

[1:51:22] a child
[1:51:24] of God.
[1:51:27] Can you give the Lord a hand clap of
[1:51:28] praise tonight?

[1:51:34] It won't be long.

[1:51:39] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; Oh, and then we'll be leaving
[1:51:46] him.

[1:52:00] Sing that part again. It won't be long.
