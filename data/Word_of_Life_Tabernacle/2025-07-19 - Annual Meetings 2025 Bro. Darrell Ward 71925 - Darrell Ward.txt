That every life would be touched. I pray, God, that maybe there's some here tonight that's oppressed. Lord, I pray that they would be delivered. And Lord, maybe there's some with hard questions. But God, I think about how at one time, Lord, there was a queen that heard of the wisdom of Solomon and she traveled from a great a far distance. And Lord, when she come, she come with hard questions, Lord. But her testimony was that the half had not been told. And I believe that are greater than Solomon is here tonight. Lord, there might be hard questions. But Lord, I believe that the half has not been told of the things that you can do. Lord, you can do exceeding abundantly above all that we can ask or think. And Lord, we thank you, Lord, that you've given us that revelation, God, to know, Lord, in this day that you are in fact the same yesterday, today, and forever. Lord, you sent a message, Lord.

If you stand to your feet, I wonder if we could sing this and then Brother Colby will sing a song to bring Brother Daryl out on. I want to just sing this one here first. And I want to say this. We're under great expectation for tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe I walked in the building a little bit ago and uh right before the service and and prophet was standing there in the prayer line on deep calls to the deep and I could see the people when he said stand to your feet everywhere. I saw the people standing with their hands in the air and just responded. I thought you know what there's expectation in the building tonight &gt;&gt; and you'll get what you expect. That's right. You believe that? How many needs a miracle tonight? &gt;&gt; I believe every one of us needs something in our lives. &gt;&gt; And I believe tonight is that night. Brother Daryl's going to speak for us tonight. He's no stranger to us. But we love Brother Daryl. We we appreciate the ministry that God has given to him. Won't take but a second, but I'll tell you real quick, two two and a half years ago in Pony, Oklahoma, Brother Daryl was standing there. Brother Jonathan Martin had preached and Brother Daryl was standing there in the front praying for people. And my wife come forward. She had been diagnosed with alpha gal and she'd break out just ever just all the time and she was on steroids and things like that. And she walked down to the front that night and I told brother Daryl what she needed and he said with her faith he said he said it's already done. He said don't even worry about it. &gt;&gt; She left that building and never even had a symptom after that night. [Music] He never lost the battle and he never will. &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe we've heard it this weekend. If we can surrender, &gt;&gt; then anything is possible here tonight. We're going to sing this song and then brother Kobe will sing a song to bring Brother Daryl out on. So I I just wanted to sing this song tonight with all of our hearts. I wonder if we could just surrender for a moment of worship. Sing, &gt;&gt; I surrender. Oh, I surrender. Lord I surrender. Oh Lord I surrender my life. Oh I give it all to you. Oh, I surrender. Oh, yes we do, Lord. Oh, I surrender. [Music] Lord, I surrender my life. I give it all to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Can we raise our hands as a sign of surrender now? Oh, I surrender. [Applause] Lord, I surrender. Oh Lord, I surrender my life. [Applause] [Music] I give it all to you. [Music] Oh, I surrender. All you surrender now. Oh, I surrender. [Applause] [Music] Lord, I surrender my life. and I give it all. &gt;&gt; Amen. You can be seated for just a moment before brother Daryl comes. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Sing this now. Oh, he is he. [Music] &gt;&gt; Healing is he. [Music] We believe in all &gt;&gt; healing is [Music] receive. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; Oh he is glory. &gt;&gt; Healing is he. [Music] your praise. &gt;&gt; He lives here. &gt;&gt; I believe it. And I believe it. I lift my hands. Oh, I lift my hands toward the heavens. I lift my eyes where my help comes from. I look to you, my rock and my healer. I trust in you. Jesus is here. Oh, Jesus is here. Do you believe that tonight? Oh, Jesus is here. Hallelujah. Lord, &gt;&gt; Jesus is here. [Music] &gt;&gt; Lord, I receive it. I reach my hands. Oh, I reach my hand toward the heavens. I lift my eyes where my help comes from. I look to you, my rock, my heer. I trust in you. nothing. Oh, I reach my hand toward the heavens. I lift my eyes where my help comes from. I look to you, my rock, my healer. I trust in you. [Music] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Do you trust him? &gt;&gt; He never really asked us to understand. &gt;&gt; Sometimes while we go through a trial or while we have a difficulty, &gt;&gt; but he said, "Can you trust me?" &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; Many years ago, I worked in surgery. I assisted surgeons and did been on thousands of operations. And there's a man came in. He's a Baptist preacher and he had through a blood clot killed 90% of his bow. A large percent of his bow was killed. When he came into the operating room, his bowels had been dead for 4 days. And when they opened him up, we could hardly stay in the room. And the doctor I was working with, I was standing across from him and he made this statement. He said, "This is a dead man. There's no way he can live. He doesn't have enough bow left to live." And I was standing there. I never spoke out loud, but in my heart, I said, "That's true, Lord. I I don't see how the man can live &gt;&gt; and all at once &gt;&gt; this warm feeling come over me and I begin to cry just turned my head away. I didn't want him to see the tears and a voice spoke to my heart. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And said, "Is there anything too hard for God?" &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I said, "No, Lord. There's nothing too hard for you." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You can do anything. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; That man lived. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; For many years after that, he lived. &gt;&gt; And I saw him in the cafeteria of the hospital about a year later. And I sat down in front of him and I said I me I called his name. And it startled him that I knew his name. And I said, "I know you don't know me, but I was on your operation." And I shared with him what I just shared with you. me and he'll both sit there had wept. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In a public hospital &gt;&gt; because we serve a God &gt;&gt; that there's nothing too hard for him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There is nothing in this building tonight that my God cannot take care of. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. Do you love him? I bring you greetings from my pastor, brother Donnie Reagan and my &gt;&gt; family at home and the church family and we just greet you and he wanted to make sure I tell you hello and I told him I would. And I want to quickly we'll go straight to the word, but I want to thank all the sisters and the brothers and all that was done to provide food for us. And &gt;&gt; I want to thank the brothers that sweated so much out there parking the cars and &gt;&gt; the deacons and the tr all that was done and &gt;&gt; that lovely place you gave us to stay and just all that you've done for us. From the bone of my heart, I thank you for that. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I greet you this evening in the wonderful name of Jesus Christ because there is no greater name than the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And there is power in the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; What wonderful messages we have heard this weekend. &gt;&gt; After I heard these brothers preach, I thought about trying to get my job back in surgery. I thought, "Oh my, I just feel so small to stand here with these great men of God." But I appreciate Brother Ben allowing us. And may the Lord richly bless you. Be our prayer. And I pray that there'll be many testimonies come from tonight. &gt;&gt; Cuz there's one thing I know my God cannot do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He cannot fail. &gt;&gt; If you have your Bibles, turn with us to the book of Mark. We want to read from Mark chapter 10. starting at verse 46 and certainly enjoyed the song service and thank you brother Kobe for singing that song. I just it just speaks to my heart and want to read from Mark chapter 10 starting at verse 46. I know it's hot in here and so we'll be just as real quick and try not to keep you long at all and we'll go right into the prayer line. &gt;&gt; Do you love him? &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The Bible says this. They came to Jericho. And as he went out of Jericho with the disciples, a great number of people, blind Barnameus, the son of Tmus, sat by the highway side begging. And when he had heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out and say, "Jesus, thou son of David, &gt;&gt; have mercy on me." &gt;&gt; And many charged him that he should hold his peace. So he apologized and stayed quiet. &gt;&gt; But the Bible said he cried the more a great deal. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thou son of David, have mercy on me. &gt;&gt; And Jesus stood still. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Something's fixing to happen now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he commanded him to be called. And they called the blind man, saying unto him, "Be of good comfort. Rise. He calleth thee. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he casting away his garment, rose, and came to Jesus. &gt;&gt; And Jesus answered and said unto him, What wil thou that I should do unto thee? And the blind man said unto him, Lord, &gt;&gt; that I might receive my sight. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way. Thy faith hath made thee whole. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And immediately he received his sight &gt;&gt; and followed Jesus in the way. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He didn't have no trouble seeing &gt;&gt; what direction Jesus went. &gt;&gt; What a blessing it is tonight to know &gt;&gt; that the same Jesus &gt;&gt; who gave Barnameus his eyesight back &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; is the same Jesus &gt;&gt; who gave my daughter Jessica &gt;&gt; her eyesight back. And that same Jesus is in this house &gt;&gt; tonight. &gt;&gt; Let us bow our heads. &gt;&gt; I want to speak to you for just a few minutes on step out to your promise. Heavenly Father, we love you, Lord. Thank you for all you've done for us. And we ask, oh God, that you would move tonight upon every heart and upon every home. &gt;&gt; And Lord, may they come forth from these meetings great testimonies. For you are our God, &gt;&gt; and you gave the promise, I am the Lord that healeth all thy diseases. &gt;&gt; So Lord, we commit this congregation and oursel into your hands &gt;&gt; for your glory. Receive honor to yourself. we pray. Thank you Lord once again for loving us for we ask these things in Jesus name. And the bride says &gt;&gt; God bless you. May be seated. &gt;&gt; So we title this to step out to your promise. &gt;&gt; Now notice I didn't say a promise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I said your promise. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you see, it's a personal revelation. &gt;&gt; For the Bible said, "The promise is unto you." &gt;&gt; Amen. And to your children, even as far off, as many as the Lord our God shall call. &gt;&gt; You know, Brother Benham, several times he used this illustration of a box of rattlesnakes. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And he said, "What if someone came up in the morning to your door, an express agent, you know, or FedEx or Prime or whatever it would be today, and they would say that they had a box of rattlesnakes." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And it had your name on them. &gt;&gt; And they said, "Here you are. &gt;&gt; They're yours." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You see the rattlesnakes. &gt;&gt; You hear the rattlesnakes. &gt;&gt; You know that the rattlesnakes are there &gt;&gt; just like you know your symptoms. Yeah, &gt;&gt; that's right. &gt;&gt; Or there. &gt;&gt; And the prophet said, "If you receive them, &gt;&gt; they're yours." &gt;&gt; But you don't have to take them. &gt;&gt; You can say, "I don't want them." &gt;&gt; And he can say, "But your name is on them." &gt;&gt; But you can say, "I don't want them. I won't have them. &gt;&gt; And he'll do everything he can to make you take them." &gt;&gt; And in one sense, they're yours. &gt;&gt; And in another sense, they're not. And &gt;&gt; you know, you about to see all your symptoms &gt;&gt; and the devil said, "Here it is. Here's your cancer. Here's your arthritis. Here's your heart trouble. Here's your mental trouble. Here's your marital trouble. Here's your condition. &gt;&gt; Here you go. &gt;&gt; It's yours. &gt;&gt; But it's really not yours until you sign for them. &gt;&gt; But if you refuse to sign for them, oh, I like this. He has to take them back. It has to go back to the one that's trying to give it to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He can stand there and argue &gt;&gt; as much as he wants to argue, but until you take them and sign for them, they belong to the express company, until you sign for the rattlesnakes. &gt;&gt; And the prophet said, "Don't sign for nothing the devil brings." &gt;&gt; Amen. You say, "I refuse to have it." That's right. take it back. &gt;&gt; Have nothing to do with it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If you won't testify that you've got it, when you testify, you still have your sickness. The devil keeps it with you. &gt;&gt; As long as you have your problem, it's your problem. As long as you have your symptom, it's your symptom. &gt;&gt; As long as you say, "Well, I'm no good and nobody care." That's all you'll ever have. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you receive them, they're yours, but you don't have to take them. &gt;&gt; You can say, "I don't want them." Well, your name's on it. I do not want that box of rattlesnakes. &gt;&gt; But if you sign for them &gt;&gt; and receive them, &gt;&gt; they're yours. Come on. &gt;&gt; And so I got to thinking, &gt;&gt; if that's true for a box of rattlesnakes, &gt;&gt; would it not be true &gt;&gt; if a man of God, &gt;&gt; a son of God, &gt;&gt; a messenger from heaven, &gt;&gt; brother, &gt;&gt; was to come and offer you a box, &gt;&gt; and in this box is healing. In this box is joy. In this box is peace. In this box is a revival. It's deliverance. It's redemption. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's yours. It's got your name on it. It's for you. &gt;&gt; But if you don't accept it and believe it, it goes back to the one who said it. &gt;&gt; But if you accept it and believe it and confess it, &gt;&gt; you can have everything that's in the box. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. God can only bless you as you confess &gt;&gt; that he's done it for you. &gt;&gt; The Bible said he's the high priest of our confession. &gt;&gt; He's the high priest of our confession. He can only do for you. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; As we accept it, believe it &gt;&gt; and confess it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The ABCs of your healing. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Accept it, &gt;&gt; believe it. &gt;&gt; Confess it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I found this quote so astounding. &gt;&gt; He said, "Let me give you a little instruction that I might say to the sick." Yeah. &gt;&gt; Before you come here to be prayed for. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; He said, "You might have angels &gt;&gt; to lay hands on you. Do you think about a prayer line &gt;&gt; where angels of God come down dressed in white &gt;&gt; and would stand there and you would come through the prayer line and angels of God would lay their hands on you. What a prayer line that would be. [Applause] But I want you to understand, no prayer line can heal you. &gt;&gt; And angels might lay hands on you. &gt;&gt; But the prophet said it will never do you any good. &gt;&gt; It'll not do one thing for you &gt;&gt; unless first you believe it, accept it, and confess it. &gt;&gt; Think about that. An angel of God wants to lay hands on you. But if you don't receive what God has already done for you, &gt;&gt; it'll do you &gt;&gt; no good. &gt;&gt; For he's the high priest of our confession. Then what are we confessing? &gt;&gt; We need to confess what we've heard this weekend. I am a son of God. I was in God's mind before the foundation of the world. I am put here to manifest his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. We've got to confess it first &gt;&gt; before he can witness it before God. &gt;&gt; For he's the high priest there to make intercession upon our confession &gt;&gt; of what he has done for us. &gt;&gt; The ABCs of your healing, the ABCs of your deliverance, the ABCs of any blessing &gt;&gt; that the word of God has for you &gt;&gt; is accept it, &gt;&gt; believe it, and confess it. And I say to you, if we can do that tonight, if you can accept it, believe it, and confess it, I tell you, in the name of the Lord, we will see miracles, we will see giants fall, we will see revival. The the prophet of God said, the angel of the Lord told him, if you can get the people to believe, nothing will stand in your way, not even cancer. It's not a what you feel. It's not a goosebump. It's not a sensation. It's by faith. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Your emotions will lie to you. Sensations will lie to you. Symptoms will lie to you. But God's word will never lie. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Our story opens this evening on blind Barnameus. And he had been blind for many years. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He wasn't born that way. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But something had happened &gt;&gt; to cause him &gt;&gt; to go blind. &gt;&gt; And after all the years of blindness, &gt;&gt; he had took on the name &gt;&gt; of blind &gt;&gt; Barameus &gt;&gt; the beggar. And everyone around him just gave up on the ideal that he would ever see again. &gt;&gt; And they never thought of him of any other way &gt;&gt; than blind Barnameus were &gt;&gt; crippled John. &gt;&gt; And he made his living at the gate begging for coins. &gt;&gt; And it must have been a cold October morning. The prophet said &gt;&gt; blind Barnameus was getting to the gate late &gt;&gt; because you see you had to get there early to get a good place &gt;&gt; because when the businessmen and tourists come into the city they would throw him coins and that's how he made his living. &gt;&gt; So you had to get there early to get a good place. But this morning he got there late. was he had dreamed all night. &gt;&gt; Oh God, &gt;&gt; that he could see &gt;&gt; and all the businessmen had done go into the city and the few tourist was done gone. So what could he do? He wouldn't get a coin. &gt;&gt; And he listened and he could hear no one coming into the city. &gt;&gt; The morning wasn't looking good. The day had gotten off to a bad start. &gt;&gt; But little did he know &gt;&gt; that this would be the last day he would ever have to beg for a coin &gt;&gt; because of blindness. For this day was the day of his deliverance. &gt;&gt; And you may have woke up this morning depressed. You may have woke up sick with a bad doctor's report. &gt;&gt; Things may not have looked good for you. The morning might have started off so bad, but I'm here to tell you that today is the last day you have to deal with that fear, with that sickness, with that habit. For this day is the day of your deliverance. &gt;&gt; So, blind Barnameus took his place &gt;&gt; beside the gate and he fell around till he felt a big stone and he sat down. He thought, you know, this is the very stone that I'm sitting on right now. This is the very stone that the power of God shook off the top of the wall of Jericho &gt;&gt; when he broke the wall down. &gt;&gt; I'm sitting on a rock that come off the wall that God broke that wall down. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I'm sitting right here where God manifested his great power. &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh, brother Daryl, I wish I could have been there. I wish I could sit there where that great miracle took place." &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; But I'm here to tell you &gt;&gt; that the very place you're sitting tonight, we have seen that same God manifest himself in healing, in deliverance, in salvation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You don't have to wish you was there because you're here. Oh yes. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Setting in the warm sunshine, &gt;&gt; warming himself from the gold cold morning. &gt;&gt; And he begin to think of what he was dreaming about the night before. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Oh, what a wonderful dream it was. &gt;&gt; I could see this dream. It was It was so real. What made me dream that? &gt;&gt; I haven't thought about seeing for years. I just wonder, is there a possibility &gt;&gt; that I could see again? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And maybe you're sitting here tonight wondering, is there a possibility &gt;&gt; that I won't need a cane anymore? Is it a possibility &gt;&gt; that arthritis will leave me? &gt;&gt; That my joints won't be stiff? that my marriage will come back together. &gt;&gt; Oh, every believer in here, &gt;&gt; you need to take the word impossible out of your vocabulary. &gt;&gt; Impossible should never be a word that a believer utters. For the Bible said, "All things are possible." &gt;&gt; To who? To him that believes. We should never say impossible. We should never say no hope. We should never say it's too bad. &gt;&gt; We should never say the doctor said. Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You see, the dream changed his thinking of forever &gt;&gt; being blind &gt;&gt; to the possibility of seeing. &gt;&gt; The dream done that. And if thinking on a dream could do that, &gt;&gt; what can thinking on a promise from the word of God do? &gt;&gt; Knowing that the word cannot fail. &gt;&gt; For the Bible said, "Finally, brother, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of a good report, if there be any virtue, if there be any praise, &gt;&gt; think on these things. [Applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So we find blind Barnameus sitting on the rock off the walls of Jericho &gt;&gt; warming himself in the sun &gt;&gt; trying to get a few pennies &gt;&gt; and he was all alone and &gt;&gt; he got to thinking about his life. You know, sometimes it's good to slow down &gt;&gt; and just remember &gt;&gt; remember where God brought you from. &gt;&gt; Remember all the blessings God gave you. &gt;&gt; Remember the time you saw &gt;&gt; the coming of Elijah &gt;&gt; and the message of the hour. Then he got to thinking and he said, "You know, I I used to come here with my lamb and I I had these turtle doves that would do tricks and they would help me get the attention of the people to help me get a few coins. &gt;&gt; I remember that." &gt;&gt; What happened to those doves? &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. I remember my wife got sick and the doctor didn't know what to do and I went behind the house to pray to God and I said, "Lord, my wife's real sick and I don't know what to do and I need her. Lord, she cooks for me. She washes my clothes. She puts my fork and my plate always in the same place so I can find them. &gt;&gt; I need her so much. &gt;&gt; Don't take her from me, Lord. &gt;&gt; If you'll let my dear precious wife get well, I promise you I'll take these two turtle doves and offer them to you for a sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Listen, friends, don't make a promise to God &gt;&gt; unless you intend to keep it. and his wife got well &gt;&gt; and he kept his promise. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It wasn't long after that that his daughter took sick &gt;&gt; with a fever. &gt;&gt; He said, "I remember slipping out behind the house and lifting up my my blinded eyes and I said, Lord, &gt;&gt; oh my My little girl's dying. Oh, God. Friends, I don't want that like I've been to her. &gt;&gt; My little girl's dying. Lord, don't take her from me. &gt;&gt; I need her, Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; I I see the world through her eyes. &gt;&gt; She tells me what the flower looks like that I'm smelling. And she tells me all the formation that the clouds make. He sees all kinds of animals in the clouds. &gt;&gt; She brings me such joy. &gt;&gt; Don't take her from me, Lord. &gt;&gt; I don't have nothing left but my lamb. But if you let my baby live, I promise you &gt;&gt; I'll take my lamb and give it to you for a sacrifice upon the altar. And as the story goes, his daughter got well and on his road to church to offer the sacrifice, he met the priest and he said, "Where goest thou, blind Barnameus?" He said, "Priest, I go to the temple to give the Lord my lamb for a sacrifice." And he said, "Barameus, thou can't you can't do that. &gt;&gt; You can't give this lamb. This this lamb is your seeing eye animal. It helps you get around. You need that lamb to help you see &gt;&gt; here. I'll give you some money. Go and buy a lamb and offer it to God &gt;&gt; because this lamb is your eyes. &gt;&gt; Barameus said, "But I never promised God a lamb. &gt;&gt; I promised God this lamb." &gt;&gt; And if I obey my promise to Jehovah, he will provide a lamb for my eyes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he thought, "What made me say that? What made me, you know, sometimes under inspiration, we'll say things we don't even really realize we're saying. &gt;&gt; What made me say that? &gt;&gt; You see, God's always made a preparation for healing in all ages, at all time, for he is the healer. &gt;&gt; And thinking on these ways of the provided lamb sitting there, he began to hear a noise. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; What's going on? Someone said, "It's Jesus of Nazareth." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The lamb of God. &gt;&gt; The lamb of God. &gt;&gt; The lamb of God. He's come. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Something be to pulsate in his heart. And when blind Barnameus heard that the lamb, the provided way, the lamb of God, he be to cry out, "Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on me." And someone said, "Hey, we don't act like that around here. [Applause] We just kind of nod our head, you know. If we agree, just &gt;&gt; we don't want none of that screaming around here. Just if you agree, just nod your head. &gt;&gt; They said, "Hold your peace." But the Bible said he cried out louder. &gt;&gt; And let me say, "Do not let the devil dampen your faith. If you need something for God, cry out for it. &gt;&gt; He cried louder. That was his lamb. That was his lamb. If he could get his attention, &gt;&gt; his blindness would be over. &gt;&gt; But you see, it wasn't his voice. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That stopped Jesus. &gt;&gt; Come on, preer. &gt;&gt; It was not his voice. It was his faith. And if his faith can stop Jesus, your faith can stop him tonight. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Think of it. The faith of an insufficient beggar. &gt;&gt; A blind man set him by the gate begging &gt;&gt; stop the son of God. &gt;&gt; On his way to Calvary. &gt;&gt; Oh God. &gt;&gt; Oh God. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; If his faith done that &gt;&gt; sir, &gt;&gt; what would your faith do today? &gt;&gt; It'll bring him down from heaven &gt;&gt; here to any individual. &gt;&gt; The prophet said he'd come all the way from glory to make one person well. &gt;&gt; For the sake of one. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You say, "Who's that one?" &gt;&gt; It's you. [Music] That's how much he loves you. &gt;&gt; And the Bible said Jesus stood still and they said he stopped. He's calling for you. Now blind Barnameus is left with this decision. &gt;&gt; The same decision that every one of you is facing this evening. &gt;&gt; He is left with this decision. either sit still on this rock &gt;&gt; or get up and step out &gt;&gt; to Jesus. Now remember the prophet said he was 150 yards away from Jesus &gt;&gt; and he's totally blind, &gt;&gt; raggedy and poor. &gt;&gt; And yet Jesus said, "Come here." &gt;&gt; And brother Brandon was talking to his sister said, "Now the devil, he's seen you just ready to receive it." &gt;&gt; And he said, "I'll put a little damper on her." Brother Br makes a little sound to illustrate a fan. I'll fan her a little bit, you know, kind of cool her down a little bit. Come on. &gt;&gt; But oh my &gt;&gt; oh my. When the devil tries to dampen you down, that's when you rise up and claim your Godgiven rights. &gt;&gt; If Satan is telling you you can't get well, your problem is too bad. You ought to know he's lying to you. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Why would you believe that over what God said? God. Hallelujah. God said, "I am the Lord thy God who heals all thy deceas. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You see, Satan uses reasoning. &gt;&gt; He uses reasoning against faith. &gt;&gt; How's he coming &gt;&gt; immediately? Reason would say, "Sit still." &gt;&gt; Well, the master the master, he's he's asked you to do something that you simply can't do. &gt;&gt; How you know where to find him? You're blind. All this people, all this crowd, all this noise. How you going to find him? &gt;&gt; After all, you're &gt;&gt; blind. &gt;&gt; How you going to find him? Reason says you can't find him. There's all kinds of obstacles in your way. &gt;&gt; There's people in your way. &gt;&gt; You're totally blind. &gt;&gt; Just sit still. Don't embarrass yourself. &gt;&gt; Just sit &gt;&gt; still. &gt;&gt; But you see, oh God, &gt;&gt; as brother Andrew preached the first night, it was his moment. &gt;&gt; It was his time of opportunity. It was his moment with Jesus. He had an audience with the master. &gt;&gt; And he could not let that opportunity &gt;&gt; pass by. Come on. &gt;&gt; You see, if he would have sat there, this would have been a different story all together. &gt;&gt; And if you just sat there, &gt;&gt; it'll be a different story. &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. &gt;&gt; All together. &gt;&gt; But if you step out to your promise, &gt;&gt; you see when that little boy had his lunch that Jesus wanted to feed the multitude, as long as he kept that lunch, it was his. &gt;&gt; Is that not true? But when he gave it to Jesus, look what Jesus could do with it. As long as you keep your problem, that's your problem. As long as you keep that symptom, that's your symptom. But if you can get up and step out and give it to Jesus, just look what he's able to do with it. &gt;&gt; You say, "Will it work?" I tell you, I tell you from the depths of my heart, it will work. when Jessica was struck by that train and two of my family was killed and the doctors gave us no hope that she would even live. And I stood there at the window of that hospital room that day and I said, "Father, Jessica's hurt more than I could do anything about. There's nothing I could do to help my baby. &gt;&gt; All my medical knowledge, all the surgeries I'd been in, there was nothing I could do to help Jessica." And &gt;&gt; so I said to him, I said, "Father, I give her to you." &gt;&gt; I place her in your hands. &gt;&gt; If you take her life, I'll love her as much. I love you as much as I ever loved you. I'll preach as hard as I ever preach. But if you'll let my baby live, &gt;&gt; I'll try my best to tell the world what you did for her. And by God's grace, I have kept that promise to the best of my ability. And several years later, I run into brother Louie. He had a Little Debbie cake route. He's one about killed every one of us up home little Debbie cakes. But and he said, "Come out to the truck. I got some cakes for the kids." And I went out there and he was listening to a tape and brother said something like this. I don't remember it verbatim, but it was something like this. He was talking about Yoseed and and and Amram. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And he said, "When Yoseph and Amram gave Moses to God, &gt;&gt; God gave Moses back to them. &gt;&gt; And while I was standing there, this feeling just come over me. I've never heard an audible voice in my life, but you know how it is. Something just speaks to your heart." &gt;&gt; And something spoke to my heart. I believe it was him. And he said, "Because you gave me Jessica." Because you gave me Jessica, &gt;&gt; I gave Jessica back to you. &gt;&gt; You got a wayward child. You got a wayward son. You got a wayward daughter. You got a wayward husband, a wayward wife. You know what I do if I was you? I'd give them to Jesus. And if you give them to Jesus, just see what my Lord is able to do. He could not let that opportunity pass him by. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Like the woman with the blood shield, &gt;&gt; she saw he was passing by. Her window of opportunity was closing. &gt;&gt; She couldn't get over the crowd &gt;&gt; or through the crowd. &gt;&gt; She didn't quit. &gt;&gt; She went under the crowd. &gt;&gt; But what was she dealing with? hindrances, &gt;&gt; barriers, &gt;&gt; and the prophet said, "If you ever come to Christ, you're going to have to press your way to him &gt;&gt; cuz there's going to be all kinds of people trying to hold &gt;&gt; you back." &gt;&gt; And sometimes it's those that's closest to us &gt;&gt; that'll try to discourage us. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. That's true, friends. &gt;&gt; That's true. I appreciate every phone call I ever got. But when Jessica was blind and people would call and they'd say, "Is she seeing?" I'd say, "Not yet." &gt;&gt; Well, brother D, bless God, it'll be a greater miracle tomorrow. I know it. I'm believing it. &gt;&gt; Well, after a week went by, two weeks, three weeks, a month, a month and a half, two months. Ring, is she seeing? No, not yet. Well, brother Daryl, we're praying, brother. And I told my wife, I said, "I don't even want to answer the phone anymore &gt;&gt; because all I hear is, "Well, brother Daryl, &gt;&gt; hindrances, &gt;&gt; barriers." Sometimes the people closest to us &gt;&gt; will try to slow us down. &gt;&gt; Satan loves barriers. He loves hindrances. &gt;&gt; Anything to keep you away from getting to Jesus. You know what a horse race when they back those horses in and they close that gate at a horse race horse track. You know what that gate's called? It's called a barrier. &gt;&gt; But you know what that barrier means? It means there's a victory lane just ahead. &gt;&gt; Well, brother Daryl, I've got this hindrance. I You know what that tells me? You got a miracle on the way. You got a victory on the way. Come on, somebody. Do not let the barrier hinder you. Press beyond the barrier. You thought all hell to get here tonight, &gt;&gt; but maybe you're here &gt;&gt; for your greatest miracle. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Turn your faith to the one who can change the situation &gt;&gt; like that. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; She never touched his back. She never touched his arm. She got down and crawled through the legs of the people and touched the hymn of his garbage &gt;&gt; and immediately her blemish issue stopped. 12 years of bleeding stopped instantly. &gt;&gt; So blind Barname I'm hurry. I know it's hot. It's hot up here. So blind Barnameus stepped out of reason. He stepped out of all the reasons of why he should not get up off that rock he was sitting on. &gt;&gt; You're blind. It's 150 yards away. Can you trust those people to get you to Jesus? &gt;&gt; All the noise, all the crowd. You don't even know exactly where he's standing. &gt;&gt; And every one of those was valid reasons &gt;&gt; why he should just sit still. You see, reasoning will have you sit still. &gt;&gt; But faith, oh God, &gt;&gt; faith goes into action. This is my day. This is my time. This is my opportunity. I cannot miss my opportunity. &gt;&gt; And blind Barnameus gets up and goes to Jesus by faith. Why? Cuz Jesus said come. And if Jesus says come, &gt;&gt; come on. &gt;&gt; The way's already been provided to get there. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And if he's calling for you tonight, the way has already been provided for you. &gt;&gt; Just step out to your promise. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's what we need tonight is faith to take action. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not enough to say, "I believe." The devil believes. It's not enough to say, "I believe it." You must act on it. &gt;&gt; You must accept it, believe it. &gt;&gt; And confess it. &gt;&gt; How do we Noah believe? How do we know Noah believed God? &gt;&gt; How do we know that? When God told him, "It's going to rain. Build a boat, it's going to rain." How do we know that Noah believed what God said? It had never rained before. God watered the earth from from the deep, from the springs. There had never been a cloud in the sky. How do we know that Noah believed God against what the eyes said was impossible? &gt;&gt; How do we know he believed God? &gt;&gt; Because he took action and he built the ark &gt;&gt; before the rain ever fell. &gt;&gt; You talk about eyesight. He saw rain coming 120 years away. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. How do we know Joshua believed those walls would fall down? They was 46 foot high, 80 foot thick. He built the walls when he was in Egypt. He knew what went in them. He knew how tight they were, how thick they were. He knew they run chariot races around the top of them. People had their houses built on top of them. You know, like Rahab. &gt;&gt; And there he stood and God said, "I want you to march around the wall, blow a trumpet, let out a shout, and the walls are going to come down. Really? &gt;&gt; Do I need some dynamite &gt;&gt; backho? &gt;&gt; Bulldozer. &gt;&gt; No, just march. &gt;&gt; Bow a trumpet, &gt;&gt; shout &gt;&gt; and the walls are going to come down. Now, how do we know Joshua believed that? Against every bit of his intellect, against every bit of his knowledge of walls that he learned in Egypt. &gt;&gt; Because they marched around the walls, shouting the victory before the walls ever came down. Lord, I believe. Lord, I believe. I believe what you say to me. You're my healer. You're my deliverer. You're the keeper of my flame. Come on, somebody. Has our God ever failed us? Has God ever told us something that did not come to pass? I say we can trust our God. Faith jumps. It leaps into action. &gt;&gt; And I tell you tonight, if you can believe, if you can believe what I'm telling you tonight, you can right now start shouting the victory before you ever come through the prayer line. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Give your faith a chance. &gt;&gt; Turn it loose. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Unbridle it. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Let it work. &gt;&gt; You've got it all bound down with tradition. &gt;&gt; Has to be a certain way or a certain preacher or I have to say a certain thing. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. That's simply not true. &gt;&gt; Amen. Re said, "Turn it loose. &gt;&gt; Cut it loose. Let God have his way with you. &gt;&gt; You know, we sing that song, let go and let God have his wonderful way. &gt;&gt; And then we won't let him. &gt;&gt; We try to dictate how the service goes. &gt;&gt; Well, &gt;&gt; I'll just stay with preaching on healing for a little bit. But &gt;&gt; but you see, somebody's word is right. That's right. &gt;&gt; It's either what you're looking at with your eyes &gt;&gt; or what God said. &gt;&gt; But don't look at it with the eyes of your head. Satan chose the eyes of your head, but God chose the eyes of your heart. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And we see those things that we do not see with our earthly eyes. The eyes of our heart declares it. Amen. &gt;&gt; God's word is true. I believe all of it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; People put so much faith in what doctors saying. And I've got nothing against doctors. I went to one before I came down here. I worked with doctors. I have nothing against them. &gt;&gt; But I can tell you doctors can be 100% correct. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And they can be 100% wrong. &gt;&gt; And you know what? You still have to pay them. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; People put so much faith in their doctor and I got nothing against them. honest. &gt;&gt; But you've got to realize that every class of 100 doctors, somebody graduated last. &gt;&gt; And it might just be your doctor. &gt;&gt; Matter of fact, the only reason he is a doctor is because his daddy was dean of the medical school &gt;&gt; and he got his degree because his daddy was dean maybe an autopin. I don't know. He doesn't. Come on. &gt;&gt; But he become a doctor because his daddy was dean of the medical school. &gt;&gt; Now ask me how I know that. &gt;&gt; So doctors can be right &gt;&gt; and they can be wrong. &gt;&gt; But I declare to you tonight, God's word is never &gt;&gt; wrong. &gt;&gt; Let me hurry. Let me hurry. And the Bible said he casted away his garment, rose and came to Jesus. Now this garment has a plays an important part. And some scholars you I couldn't really find where it was proven or not but some say that this garment this coat that he wore was actually issued by the government to identify him as a beggar. So like a license or like a permit to beg outside the city. So they wore this coat showing that they had the authority or the right to beg for money. &gt;&gt; Now I don't know if that's true or not but it makes a good point nonetheless. Anyway, we do know that the cloak was significant. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because you see, that's how he made his living. &gt;&gt; And while he was yet blind, he rose up and cast it on the ground. &gt;&gt; And him leaving it on the ground indicates how much that he believed Jesus would restore his sight. &gt;&gt; He said, "I won't need this anymore. I will not need this anymore." Why? Because Jesus is here. Jesus is here. He's in the house. He is in the house. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh God. Can you leave that depression robe? Can you leave that arthritis robe, that glaucoma robe, that sugar diabetes robe, that depression robe, that anxiety robe, that marriage ro? Can you leave that? &gt;&gt; Can you cast it aside and leave it? [Applause] &gt;&gt; That I trouble &gt;&gt; that stomach trouble, &gt;&gt; that fear robe. &gt;&gt; Leave it on the ground. &gt;&gt; Step out towards your promise. &gt;&gt; Cast off that condemnation robe. &gt;&gt; If we ask God to forgive him, he is to forgive us. He's just &gt;&gt; Is that not true? &gt;&gt; You say, &gt;&gt; you know, I've seen that thing with how long does it take the Lord to forgive you? As long as it takes you to ask. &gt;&gt; No, there's a sister. Can Can just a few more? Listen. There's a sister told me this herself. She said, "I was a young teenager. I was in Brother Bram's meeting down in Louisiana &gt;&gt; and I've been smoking cigarettes. My mama didn't know. My daddy didn't know. The pastor didn't know. &gt;&gt; I'd sneak behind the barn and I'd smoke cigarettes. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And she said, "I was standing there in the prayer line and brother Benham, about three people in front of me told this man, you've got a habit in your life. It's cigarettes. They're in your pocket right now." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And the man said, "That's true." Yes. &gt;&gt; And she said, "I was standing there and I thought, oh Lord, as soon as I stand before that man, he's going to tell my mama, my daddy, my pastor, &gt;&gt; he going to tell everybody I've been smoking cigarettes." &gt;&gt; And she said, I said, "Lord, forgive me for that." &gt;&gt; And she said, "Brother Daryl, when I stood before the prophet, &gt;&gt; he never said a word about the cigarettes." &gt;&gt; You know why? Because when she asked God to he took that and dropped it in the sea of forgetfulness. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Aren't you grateful for the grace of God? &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Jesus answered him and said unto him, "What do you want me to do for you? And I ask you tonight, what do you want Jesus to do for you? &gt;&gt; How many of you sick here tonight? &gt;&gt; How many has a problem? Well, just praise the Lord. Hardly anybody who's got a problem tonight. &gt;&gt; He's got trouble tonight. Don't raise your hand if you don't. I'm not asking you. I'm just trying to cuz I want you to understand. No matter how much you want to be healed tonight, no matter how much you want to be delivered tonight, no matter how much you want to be restored tonight, &gt;&gt; okay? The prophet of God said he wants to heal you a thousand times more &gt;&gt; than you want to be healed. &gt;&gt; So if you're sitting here tonight said, "Oh God, I'm so tired of this arthritis. I'm so tired of this problem. I'm so tired of the sickness." God wants to do it for you a thousand times more than you want him to do it. &gt;&gt; When he calls for you, don't be afraid to step out. When he calls for you, he's got something for you. What do you want me to do? &gt;&gt; He said, Lord, that I might receive my sight &gt;&gt; and Jesus said, "Go thy way. Thy faith has made thee &gt;&gt; whole." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Notice Jesus never said, "My power." &gt;&gt; He never said, "My power has made you whole." &gt;&gt; He said, "Your faith." That's good. &gt;&gt; See, said Jesus didn't heal the sick to show his power. He healed the sick to fulfill scripture. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says in St. John 14:12, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, works I do shall you do also, and greater works than these shall you do, because I go to the Father, &gt;&gt; they shall lay hands on the sick &gt;&gt; and they shall recover." That's right. &gt;&gt; He will fulfill that scripture in this day &gt;&gt; because none of his word returns unto him &gt;&gt; void. &gt;&gt; And immediately his eyes come open &gt;&gt; and blind Barnameus standing there as I'm coming to a close standing there looking at his hands. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. for the first time. &gt;&gt; Thank you, &gt;&gt; in many years. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; He said, "Man, they sure have changed since I was young. &gt;&gt; But they're mine." &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's that that's that scar I got when I was about three years old there in the kitchen. That moment. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; That moment &gt;&gt; that he saw for the first time. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; He just &gt;&gt; And Jesus, I'll go with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. I tell you &gt;&gt; night of the accident, they took us back to the emergency room and me and my wife, her daddy and sister was killed. And we walked by this cubital and there was all this stuff everywhere and blood everywhere. And Cheryl said, "That's my daddy's blood." And we went to the next cubicle. There laid a little girl. She had leaves in her hair. She had a neck brace on. She's intubated. She's on life support. She had she had blood on her. And I said, "Friend of mine, I worked with him. He was taking care of her." I said, "Mark, how bad is it?" He said, he said, he said, "Please don't tell me this is your little girl." I said, "How bad is she, Mark?" He said, "I'm sorry. Your baby, she can't live. She just turned too bad. She got a severe severe brain injury." And they put us a little room and they put her in, "I see you. I'm coming to a closing and I was laying in that bed with my wife that night in this little room and Jessica's in the KICU kids intensive care unit. And Cheryl was crying. She said, "I've lost my daddy." She said, "I've lost my sister." And she said, "If Jessica dies," she said, "I'll just die. I can't live." &gt;&gt; And I knew she meant it, but Josh and I turned my face to the wall. Blessing God. What are you doing? You're taking everything away from me. &gt;&gt; I'm losing everything. And I saw God is my witness. It's like looking at at a video clip. I saw me and Cheryl and Jessica walk up onto the platform of Happy Valley, Jessica had on a new dress. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; And months later &gt;&gt; the Lord. &gt;&gt; Right before we came home from the hospital, 67 days in the hospital, a sister from our church came down and brought Jessica a new dress. Oh, &gt;&gt; when we came home &gt;&gt; and we walked out on that platform, &gt;&gt; you remember you was you came &gt;&gt; that was me, that was Cheryl, and that was Jessica and the new dress. &gt;&gt; Thank &gt;&gt; because our God &gt;&gt; cannot fail. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I didn't want my baby to be blind. I had a little cry room I'd go to just get away by myself and I'd lay my head against that wall and I'd cry out to God as Lord, I don't want my baby to be blind, &gt;&gt; but God rich in mercy &gt;&gt; open us. &gt;&gt; The promise that Isaiah made &gt;&gt; was true. For said, when he comes, &gt;&gt; when he comes, the blind will receive &gt;&gt; their sight. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if the Lord Jesus can heal one person, &gt;&gt; he can heal all people. &gt;&gt; And the only thing you have to know is this is to believe his presence is here. To believe that he's here to help. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He's here to help you. And if you believe that and will receive that, that he can help you. &gt;&gt; And I trust you'll do that. Each one of you be reverent. Believe on him with all your heart. The master's coming. He calls for you. He's calling for you back to health. He's calling for you back to joy, back to peace. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Don't be afraid to sign for it. Don't be afraid to accept it and believe it and confess it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You remember the bitter waters when they got to the bitter waters and they couldn't drink them and they were so upset. But the answer to the bitter water was there the whole time. &gt;&gt; Even when they was in Egypt, that tree was growing there by that bitter water. &gt;&gt; Is that not true? It was there the whole time. &gt;&gt; Here a few years ago, every second week of February, I would go to Louisiana and preach. And so I'd get my ticket about November and I'll go ahead and get my seat. And so I go down to preach there in Louisiana down in Manny, Louisiana. Brother Jeremy Cosnerers, they brought me up to Alexandria to fly home. And I'm sitting on the plane in the seat that I picked out back in November. And a man sits down beside me. He said, 'You from around here? I said, 'n no sir. He said, 'Where you from?' I said, ' Tennessee.' He said, ' Tennessee.' I said, 'Yes, sir.' He said, 'Well, what brings you down here? I said, I'm a preacher. Oh, you're a preacher? I said, yes, sir. He said, "Well, since you're a preacher, let me ask you something." I said, "Well, sir, I'm not the sharpest knife in the drawer, but if I can help you, I'd be glad to do it." He said, "My daughter was getting her kids ready to bring me to the airport." He said, "I was looking on the internet. I found something so unusual. &gt;&gt; I want to ask you about it. I said, "Sir, if I could help you, I'd be glad to do it." He said, "Have you ever heard of a man by the name of William Brandom?" [Music] &gt;&gt; And I said, "Yes, sir. His grandkids go to my church." &gt;&gt; He never sat like you're sitting. He never stopped talking all the way to Atlanta, Georgia. This guy was fired up. &gt;&gt; And when we got off the plane, he shook hands and said, "God bless you." And I was walking around concourse D there in Atlanta going to another gate to go home. I got to thinking three months before that man ever knew he had a question, &gt;&gt; God had the answer set beside you. &gt;&gt; And I say this as I close. Before you ever had a problem, before you ever had a fear, ever had a sickness, the answer was already here. &gt;&gt; He's already here. Amen. Do you believe me tonight? Do you love me tonight? Well, musicians, let's come to the instrument tonight. Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord God Almighty. He is my healer. He is my sustainer. He's my life. He's my joy. He's my beast. He's my everything. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Do you love him tonight? Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, isn't he wonderful? &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Why would I worry? Oh yes. &gt;&gt; When giants come calling my name, &gt;&gt; my God is so much bigger and troubles I &gt;&gt; Oh, why would I hunger for power or riches or fame? Cuz my God is so much better than all of these things. So I won't be shen. [Applause] I won't be moved. Amen. My God is faithful. His promise is true. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So I'll speak to the mountain. [Music] &gt;&gt; Tell him it's time to move &gt;&gt; cuz my God is bigger, better, stronger, gater. My enemies scatter. They know the battle is done. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Oh my God is stronger. The victory already. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, he died for our ransom and rose up on the third day. My God is greater than hell and the grave. Hallelujah. So I won't be shen. [Music] I won't be moved. &gt;&gt; My God is great. &gt;&gt; Yes, you are. &gt;&gt; Yes, you are, Lord. His promise is true. [Music] &gt;&gt; So I'll speak to the mountain till it's time to move. &gt;&gt; My God is big, strong, &gt;&gt; heavenly father. Lord, I'm so grateful tonight. That's not not just the words of a song. But it is the words of reality. No giant can stand before you. No sickness can stand before you. There is nothing too hard for you, God. I've seen you do, Lord. What they said was impossible. [Music] &gt;&gt; Lord, when I was a young man, I preached. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; That you opened the blinded eyes and you made the lame walk. I preached it with all my heart. I believed it with all my heart, but I never seen it. But now, Lord, I can stand before these people tonight and I can testify our God opens blinded eyes and he makes the lame walk because I see it every day of my life. When Jessica comes downstairs, &gt;&gt; opens up the refrigerator. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Goes out and gets in the car. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; I see what the doctor said impossible. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. becomes possible with you. &gt;&gt; Oh God, I pray tonight in the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Lord, if I could, I'd heal every person in this building, but I can't. Lord, I'm just a man, but you're God. &gt;&gt; But me and our ministering brothers here tonight, we yield oursel to you. And may we be a conduit, Lord. May we be a channel that the Holy Spirit can flow through and confirm to these people. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; What you've already done for them. &gt;&gt; For your prophet said, if he stood right here in this suit that someone bought from me, he said he could not heal you because you're already healed. &gt;&gt; Lord, that bitter water was turned sweet by a tree that was growing by it. &gt;&gt; That tree had already been there. It provided everything. Oh, God. to turn that bitter water sweet was in that tree. Father, I'm so glad tonight there's another tree in the midst of us. It's Calvar's tree. And everything we have need of was provided on that tree. For that day at Calvary you gave us. You hung your heart on that tree. Thank you, Lord. And God, may there be many testimonies come forth tonight. Not just from this service, but from the meetings. Dear God, as we've already heard the things that you've done. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Bless your children tonight, Lord. &gt;&gt; We love you, Father. &gt;&gt; We believe, Lord. We believe, Lord. &gt;&gt; There's nothing that you can't do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.

Our God. &gt;&gt; Oh our God. Give him a hand of praise. Glory. Oh, hallelujah. Are you ready to believe? &gt;&gt; Has your faith been increased? I want us to watch something for just a minute. And I Some of you can't sit down. So, uh, if you if you want to sit down, you can. But we've got a little video. I want you to watch a miraculous thing that happened here in the prayer line. Believe it'll build your faith. And as soon as we're done, uh, we're going to have the brothers come. You believe he still does miracles. &gt;&gt; We're not talking about miracles from many years ago. We're talking about miracles that have happened right here &gt;&gt; in these meetings &gt;&gt; and your miracles going to happen tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you believe it? &gt;&gt; Go ahead and play that, brother Peter. God bless you. So, as I was writing this out to try and condense it all, it really just impacted me of how many things went into this testimony. Little things that if we told it all, it would take all day, but I tried to condense it as best I could. Um, our testimony really begins um when we got married in uh 2022. I had rheumatoid arthritis. Um, and due to the medications I was on, we couldn't have a baby because of the side effects, what would happen to the baby. Um, and that really that really grieved us and there was no way for me to get off the medication because of how severe the RA was. Well, Gabe started really praying and claiming that at the July meetings I would be healed of RA. And we went through the prayer line and God miraculously healed me. I never had to take another medication. No pain after that. [Music] Then in 2023, we were told that we would not be able to have a baby and if we wanted to try, it would take extensive um intervention from the medical field. That really broke our hearts. Well, again, it was in the spring when that we were told that. So that summer, we went through the prayer line again. We claimed our healing. We claimed our promise, baby. We picked out a name and we held on to faith that we would hold our child during the journey and the wait for that cuz it is a journey. We lost two. But we rejoiced that they even existed because their lives were a testimony. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Because we did get pregnant. We did have babies. During the journey of that time, there was so many things that God sent us. So many just pastors or preachers doing sermons or encouragement to help us through that time of struggle. We finally were pregnant with our Lizzy. During the pregnancy, we had a really hard time, both her and I. Satan really fought us, but God was faithful. &gt;&gt; And then she was born and we rejoiced thinking that it was over. She we had her in our arms. She was safe. But three days later, we were in the NICU. This was the hardest three days of the whole journey. There was a point where we were in the Ronald McDonald's home and Lizzie was down in her room and we were just praying and crying out to God, just pleading and kind of upset after everything. Here we were and the song came back to me and the story of Isaac and Abraham and Isaac had to lay his child on the altar to give it back to the Lord knowing that he could lose that child. He had to get to that point to where he was okay in a sense of I know you'll get me through somehow. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, Gabe and I prayed and we just told the Lord, you know, you gave her to us and we rejoiced that we held our promise baby and if you take her, we don't know how, but we know it'll be okay. Little did we know in the room, Lizzy was having one of the hardest episodes she had had, and there was just this pressure to go down to her. and we rushed into her room and right behind us a nurse and a doctor had come in. But as soon as we stepped in the room, she stabilized and it was over. She didn't have another issue that we went to the ENT and he was like, "She might have it, she might not." But we just praise the Lord know that she was healed that night. Again, [Music] there was just so many little things that happened and if I went into it all, it would take all day. But we just want to thank the Lord for Elizabeth Joanne and her name means God's promise or his oath and God's grace and she is a true representation of that. &gt;&gt; Thank you. cannot fail. Because that you have said this, because that you have witnessed that you believe it. I'm going to believe this with all my heart and say God Almighty makes you well &gt;&gt; cuz I know it's a scripture. It's the truth. I believe that every person comes through the line will be made totally well. &gt;&gt; Now, what do you do with it? You don't doubt it. You hold it right before you. your token. &gt;&gt; What is your token? The Holy Spirit in your heart. You pass through that line. It has to happen. There's no way for it. &gt;&gt; No matter how many you've been through before, this is it. &gt;&gt; This is the hour. This is the time. It's over. It's settled. Just forget you ever was sick or ever had it, ever afflicted or anything. God will take care of it for you. You believe it? &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe it with all my heart. Let's give the Lord a hand. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Do you believe it, church? &gt;&gt; Do you believe? God bless you. Brother Kobe, you can begin. The brothers will begin line up. We're going to have a prayer all together. And then we'll begin lining up the prayer line over here on my left. If you'll come down this aisle on the left. And I know there's not a lot of room, but if you have a need tonight, we want to pray with you. You just come down this aisle, line up with brother Stewart, deacon here at the end, and he'll you just pass through the line this way and come around the other way. So come over here on my left, on your right. Line up. I believe the Lord I believe there's going to be miracles from tonight. Do you believe it? &gt;&gt; I believe he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. He told us, "Lay hands on the sick and they shall recover." So we're believing that tonight. God bless you.
