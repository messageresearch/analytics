[51:41] Lord thank you Lord
[51:45] Jesus Genesis Chapter 18 and verse one
[51:48] this morning we we go back to Abraham I
[51:52] while you're turning there I want to um
[51:55] uh I want to uh again let you know that
[51:58] uh we'll be traveling to Sister Carol's
[52:01] funeral and so I won't be here Wednesday
[52:03] but brother Joel will be here I know
[52:05] there'll be some others traveling as
[52:07] well so keep them in your prayers and
[52:09] then um there's a couple of meetings
[52:11] coming up and I mentioned these because
[52:14] uh these churches have been very helpful
[52:16] to us in our annual meetings in
[52:19] traveling uh and being here with us and
[52:21] that's in Pony Oklahoma and it's about a
[52:24] six-h hour trip so I know many of you
[52:27] won't be able to make it but if you are
[52:29] able to go uh i' sure appreciate you
[52:31] being there I I've got to preach at that
[52:33] meeting so I I'm not looking forward to
[52:35] it maybe as much as I would normally but
[52:38] we normally go but uh but as far as I I
[52:41] do always enjoy the meetings it's always
[52:43] a wonderful time but brother Shawn
[52:44] Martin will be there preaching as well
[52:46] and brother Jonathan Martin so the
[52:48] meetings will be wonderful so other than
[52:50] hearing me it'd be a good meeting for
[52:52] you to go to and uh so we would uh you
[52:55] know if you can make it and then that's
[52:57] September 11th through
[52:59] 15th and then um Galina meetings that
[53:02] happen every year and that church just
[53:04] shows up uh for our meetings that's only
[53:07] uh two and a half three hours away by
[53:10] Branson and so that their annual
[53:12] meetings are the 25th to the 29th so
[53:15] maybe you could make it to one of those
[53:16] and if you can I'm sure it'll be a
[53:18] blessing to you Genesis Chapter 18 and
[53:21] verse
[53:23] one says then the L uh Lord appeared to
[53:27] him in the plains of mamory and he sat
[53:31] in the tent Door In the Heat of the day
[53:35] that's all we'll read for now let's uh
[53:38] Lord at his Blessing to the word you may
[53:40] be
[53:43] seated Abraham had been on his journey
[53:46] for a long time he was 75 when God
[53:50] called him and at this point he's almost
[53:53] hundred years old he's old older than
[53:57] the oldest person sitting here this
[54:00] morning and at this point he had no idea
[54:04] when he would have that baby none it
[54:08] could be another 25 years it could be
[54:10] another 50 years he didn't know yeah and
[54:14] I'm sure you know every sign pointed
[54:18] against it because at this point also
[54:20] his body had not been changed back and
[54:23] so he was waiting there and and I'm sure
[54:27] that people come to him and Brandon put
[54:30] it this way that he'd taken on the name
[54:32] of of Abraham God had changed his name
[54:35] from Abram to Abraham and Abraham means
[54:38] father of Nations father of Nations and
[54:43] people probably come by and laughed at
[54:45] him said how many children do you have
[54:46] now Abraham how many children do you
[54:49] have now and the truth was that uh he
[54:52] still didn't have the promised son and
[54:55] yet and and it become a pressure on him
[54:58] and I'll say this this morning that when
[55:00] you take on the name of being a
[55:01] Christian there's a certain amount of
[55:03] pressure that comes with that there's a
[55:05] certain amount of the world of
[55:08] expectations that comes with that maybe
[55:10] you're waiting on things in your life to
[55:12] line up with the confession that you're
[55:14] making but just hold on because God if
[55:18] he promised it in his word he will do it
[55:20] for you and you got to hold on to that
[55:23] don't don't get discouraged because
[55:25] things haven't turned out out exactly
[55:27] like you wanted them to all at the front
[55:29] you got to hold on sometimes you just
[55:31] got to keep coming and keep coming and
[55:33] keep coming and one day there's a
[55:35] revelation that comes one day you meet
[55:38] God on the plains of mamory yes sir oh
[55:41] my and then you begin to realize oh it's
[55:44] coming real soon it's happening right
[55:48] away but up to this point every sign
[55:51] pointed against it and the more
[55:53] Revelation that Abraham received the
[55:55] more pressure he was put under because
[55:57] it seemed like that he could never meet
[56:00] or match the the promise that he was
[56:02] given and I'll say that we can never
[56:05] change our own bodies we can never
[56:07] produce a rapture we can never do that
[56:09] on our own it'll take a supernatural
[56:12] move of God it'll take God doing it
[56:14] himself in our lives we can't do that we
[56:17] won't see our loved ones again just
[56:19] based on our own efforts we're not going
[56:21] to be able to do that it'll take God to
[56:23] do that but just hold on to the promises
[56:26] morning hold on to the promise he gave
[56:28] you we will not all sleep but we shall
[56:30] all be
[56:31] changed that's a promise that he gave us
[56:33] just like he gave to
[56:36] Abraham oh my but the Bible says that he
[56:39] staggered not at the word of God through
[56:41] unbelief he went right ahead making
[56:44] ready keeping all the booties ready and
[56:47] the bird eyye that's I think a baby food
[56:50] actually and everything he was going to
[56:52] have the baby and and and
[56:56] H correct me later if that's wrong he
[56:58] staggered not at the promise of God
[57:00] through
[57:01] unbelief but was strong in faith giving
[57:05] glory to God that word staggered implies
[57:07] a mental struggle yes right but he
[57:11] didn't give in to it come
[57:13] on he felt it but he didn't give in
[57:16] it he he he had those thoughts like you
[57:21] would what if it isn't true right what
[57:25] if there's a problem what what if what
[57:27] if I'm just unable to do it he had those
[57:29] thoughts we know he did because even
[57:31] when he received the promise first
[57:33] Abraham laughed then Sarah laughed we
[57:35] know that they weren't perfect people we
[57:37] know they didn't just always but he
[57:38] staggered not means he never gave in to
[57:41] that doubt that was there he never gave
[57:44] in he will always and the Bible say he
[57:46] was strong in faith that word strong
[57:47] actually implies an increasing
[57:50] strength that the longer it was which
[57:53] should have weakened his faith but the
[57:56] longer he waited on the promise he got
[58:00] stronger church he didn't get weaker he
[58:03] got stronger and I believe that's the
[58:05] same way Abraham's seed is here today
[58:08] the more we wait the longer we wait the
[58:10] more it seems like it's it's it's
[58:11] farther off it's farther off we're
[58:13] farther down the road than we ever
[58:15] thought we'd be the world is worse than
[58:17] we ever thought it would be and yet
[58:18] we're strong in faith as strong now
[58:20] Caleb said I'm as strong now as I was 40
[58:23] years ago it may seem like it's it's
[58:26] gotten worse it may seem like things are
[58:28] worse but we've been getting
[58:31] stronger and being fully
[58:33] persuaded what he had promised he was
[58:36] able also to
[58:39] perform now Abraham would receive one
[58:41] last sign before his body change look at
[58:45] Genesis 18:1 the Lord appeared notice
[58:49] three things notice who appeared yeah
[58:53] the Lord
[58:54] appeared when no noce where it happened
[58:57] in the plains of mammory yes and when it
[59:01] happened in the heat of the day these
[59:04] things are important I believe it's
[59:06] instructive to us Genesis 12:7 tells us
[59:10] and this is the first time the Lord
[59:11] appeared to Abraham it's that same
[59:13] language the Lord capital L O R D
[59:16] appeared unto Abram said unto thy seed
[59:19] will I give this land and there builded
[59:21] he an altar unto the Lord who appeared
[59:23] unto
[59:24] him Genesis 17 we've talked about this
[59:27] he he appeared to him again when Abram
[59:29] was 90 years old and nine the Lord
[59:31] appeared to Abram said to him I am the
[59:34] almighty God walk before me and be thou
[59:39] perfect
[59:41] look and and he he he appeared now
[59:45] appear is to show it Den notes the act
[59:48] of seeing in a literal and a figurative
[59:52] sense so he perceived that the Lord was
[59:55] there now the Lord appears in a lot of
[59:57] different ways he appeared to Abram
[1:00:00] maybe in a vision maybe he appeared in a
[1:00:02] dream maybe he appeared in a in a wind
[1:00:05] or Whirlwind or a pillar of fire but in
[1:00:08] in this instance in Genesis 18 he
[1:00:11] appears in in a man yes he appears in
[1:00:15] the flesh of a man Genesis 18:2 he
[1:00:18] lifted up his eyes and looked and all
[1:00:21] three men stood by him and when he saw
[1:00:24] them he ran to meet them from the tent
[1:00:27] door and bowed himself toward the ground
[1:00:31] notice what he says and he said my Lord
[1:00:34] my Lord now remember he got the
[1:00:37] Revelation in Genesis 17 of who God was
[1:00:41] of God's name you say well that's not
[1:00:42] important whether you believe in the one
[1:00:44] God or three gods or 10 Gods it is
[1:00:47] important because he got a revelation of
[1:00:49] God's name in Genesis 17 Genesis 18 He
[1:00:53] said my Lord he said if now I have found
[1:00:55] faith favor in thy sight pass not away
[1:00:59] notice he wants to keep him there he
[1:01:00] wants to entertain him he said pass not
[1:01:03] away and he said I pray thee from thy
[1:01:06] servant now if you watch that 18th
[1:01:08] chapter immediately after the change
[1:01:11] name God Appears to reveal himself in
[1:01:15] flesh after the name is made known who
[1:01:18] he is God Appears in flesh Abraham one a
[1:01:21] hot day just a few weeks or months
[1:01:23] before Sodom was burned and Isaac come
[1:01:25] on the SE and Abraham is sitting out
[1:01:28] under his Oak and we'll get to that in
[1:01:30] just a moment but that the plains of
[1:01:32] mamory better translation is actually
[1:01:34] the oak tree of mamory and so lot is
[1:01:37] down in Sodom and they're enjoying the
[1:01:39] pleasures of the world yet he's Pastor
[1:01:42] lot probably had him a nice little
[1:01:43] congregation down there but Abraham
[1:01:46] after he had been revealed to him Elohim
[1:01:48] was who he had been talking to him so
[1:01:51] now he'd been talking to God all this
[1:01:52] time but now in Revelation or in Genesis
[1:01:55] 17 he says I am I am Elohim I am the
[1:01:59] almighty God right I am I'm the Old and
[1:02:01] New Testament I'm I'm All Abraham that
[1:02:04] you'll ever need and so he's revealed to
[1:02:07] him in that way and now he comes and oh
[1:02:12] my he's sitting under the Oak and here
[1:02:14] comes three
[1:02:15] men three men now walking like human
[1:02:20] beings and the effect of the revelation
[1:02:23] of who God was that he it had upon
[1:02:26] Abraham what it did to him was after his
[1:02:28] name was changed from Abram to Abraham
[1:02:30] he seen three men coming and he called
[1:02:33] the three one my Lord three of them
[1:02:36] being one not so with with lot he saw
[1:02:38] two coming he said my lords but
[1:02:40] Abraham's Vision Revelation showed him
[1:02:42] he was the all-sufficient Elohim and
[1:02:44] brother BR said his seed is to receive
[1:02:47] the same thing I want you to understand
[1:02:49] this said brother Ben how does this
[1:02:50] matter to my life I want you young
[1:02:52] people to understand this I want you
[1:02:54] this message was not about telling us
[1:02:56] who brother brandham was it was about
[1:02:58] telling us who a prophet was or who God
[1:03:01] was rather it wasn't about telling us
[1:03:02] who a prophet was although we needed to
[1:03:04] know that but it was about telling us
[1:03:06] who God was and who was God God was all
[1:03:10] sufficient God was Elohim so before he
[1:03:13] could receive his body change he had to
[1:03:15] receive a message of headship a message
[1:03:18] of authority a message that says I am
[1:03:21] the almighty God I still care about your
[1:03:24] body I still care about about healing I
[1:03:26] still care that's what he he come in
[1:03:28] with healing in his wings and healing
[1:03:30] revivals and said I still care about you
[1:03:32] I still oh my aren't you glad that he
[1:03:34] did he' come in Revival and showed us
[1:03:36] that he cared but he come revealing the
[1:03:38] secrets of the heart showing us that he
[1:03:40] was still God and he was showing us
[1:03:42] something he was saying he said Abraham
[1:03:44] I'm God and and I'm I'm big enough to
[1:03:47] change your body I'm big enough to keep
[1:03:49] you through Leo deia I'm big enough to
[1:03:51] take care of you big enough to take care
[1:03:54] of your children
[1:03:56] yes huh let's just be real we're real
[1:03:59] people this morning I the greatest
[1:04:01] challenge we have you see all these
[1:04:03] young people sitting on the front row
[1:04:04] and the second row and the third
[1:04:07] row and the back
[1:04:10] rows all these kids scattered throughout
[1:04:12] the church at the
[1:04:14] challenge and we live in a in a terrible
[1:04:17] age to grow up
[1:04:19] in right it's a terrible confused mixed
[1:04:22] up
[1:04:24] age and yet that we serve an almighty
[1:04:27] God we had to have a revelation that
[1:04:30] this message was sufficient that that
[1:04:32] God was going to give us a a message
[1:04:35] that was more than a man but it would be
[1:04:37] something that would give us a
[1:04:38] revelation of who he was of his
[1:04:41] sufficiency of his willingness to help
[1:04:43] of his willingness to be there of his of
[1:04:46] his presence in the age so he was the
[1:04:49] all-sufficient Elohim and so that
[1:04:52] challenge is that we can get you from
[1:04:55] from where you are and and and if the
[1:04:58] Lord carries in my generation if it
[1:05:00] doesn't come in my generation it'll come
[1:05:01] in yours if it doesn't come in yours
[1:05:02] it'll come in the next but I really
[1:05:04] believe the world can't go that much
[1:05:05] longer so how if we do have time to get
[1:05:08] these children raised how do we get them
[1:05:10] raised how do we get them to believe God
[1:05:14] how do we get them to to do that and
[1:05:16] it's not a matter of
[1:05:17] convincing it's not a matter of even
[1:05:19] teaching although we want to teach all
[1:05:21] that we can but we need them to meet God
[1:05:24] all right come on and we believe that
[1:05:26] God come down in our age and showed us
[1:05:28] that he still wanted to meet with us he
[1:05:31] didn't just want us to know him as an
[1:05:33] abstract thought he didn't want us to
[1:05:36] just know him as a as a as a God who was
[1:05:41] in in print but he wanted us to know him
[1:05:43] as a God in
[1:05:44] flesh a God In My Flesh a God in your
[1:05:48] flesh that's how he wanted to reveal
[1:05:50] himself to Abraham before the body
[1:05:52] changed oh my oh there's a great truth
[1:05:55] here and if your kids ever recognize
[1:05:58] that God is in flesh see if they can see
[1:06:00] God in you it's going to be a whole lot
[1:06:04] easier come on church that many times
[1:06:07] the reason the kids back sit and and
[1:06:09] begin to leave is because they didn't
[1:06:10] see God in the parish but if they can
[1:06:12] see God in you they'll begin to begin to
[1:06:15] come back to the Lord and begin to
[1:06:16] realize hey there is a God there there
[1:06:18] is a there is a love there there's some
[1:06:20] people who no matter what happens
[1:06:22] they're going to serve God anyway they
[1:06:24] need to see God in
[1:06:26] flesh and that's what this message is
[1:06:28] about you can talk you can tell them all
[1:06:30] about what God did through a prophet but
[1:06:32] unless they see God in flesh what that
[1:06:34] little story brother brandom

[1:06:38] caught in the storm or he was in his
[1:06:40] bedroom and the Storm come on he run in

[1:07:02] challenge of this hour it's not to build
[1:07:05] churches it's not to it's not to promote
[1:07:08] Ministries but it's to be God in
[1:07:12] flesh not in a sense of of taking the
[1:07:16] authority and saying I'm God and I can
[1:07:17] do this no but to represent God to a
[1:07:20] world that needs God Amen to children

[1:07:48] he talked to him he should
[1:07:50] know he he does all through there
[1:07:52] Abraham refers to him as the Lord he
[1:07:55] said you mean God is standing there
[1:07:56] eating that flesh of the calf and
[1:07:57] drinking the milk from the cow and

[1:09:12] Fellowship just like we did at our house
[1:09:13] last night with a few of the brothers
[1:09:14] and we're sitting there fellowshipping
[1:09:16] God came down to Abraham just like that
[1:09:19] just like we do over here in the
[1:09:20] fellowship hall just like we do many
[1:09:22] times for the trip on Sunday night or we
[1:09:24] get together we Fellowship together what
[1:09:25] are we doing oh church God came down to
[1:09:29] Abraham just like
[1:09:31] that and all Abraham saw all a normal
[1:09:35] person would see is men
[1:09:37] walking it's just three men but Abraham
[1:09:41] could see beyond that because God's giv
[1:09:43] him such a revelation of who he was that
[1:09:45] he recognized there was something
[1:09:46] different about this one man he said
[1:09:48] that's God that just p and made a body
[1:09:51] of Flesh yes I said he did it he said he
[1:09:56] said why don't you just know our he said
[1:09:57] why you just don't know our God why he
[1:09:59] could reach over look at the power of
[1:10:02] almighty God he take a handful of dust
[1:10:07] reach over and take a handful of dust
[1:10:09] brother we're made out of 16 elements
[1:10:10] petroleum Cosmic light potach different
[1:10:13] elements and calcium and he said just
[1:10:15] caught it together breathed into it so
[1:10:19] God to make a body all he had to
[1:10:22] do pick up a handful of dust
[1:10:27] and he has a
[1:10:29] body you think he can heal your
[1:10:33] body all he had to do was to make a body
[1:10:39] was that's it now look and and and and
[1:10:44] he walked down in the earth I'm so glad
[1:10:48] he's that sort of a father he said
[1:10:50] though the skin worms destroys this body
[1:10:53] yet he'll call you he promised he'll do
[1:10:56] it he's Elohim he jerked another handful
[1:10:58] and said come here woodworm or whoever
[1:11:00] it was the Angels come down let's let's
[1:11:02] go down and look at Sodom and see what's
[1:11:05] going on and Abraham after the
[1:11:07] Revelation he'd seen it and he knew that
[1:11:10] there was one God and he seen it he said
[1:11:12] my Lord come aside sit down let me wash
[1:11:17] your
[1:11:18] feet it was the Lord who
[1:11:21] appeared and and we find that again in
[1:11:23] Genesis 18:13 and I'm going to go back
[1:11:25] and forth a lot in this in this 18th
[1:11:27] chapter Lord willing uh in future weeks
[1:11:30] but the Lord said to Abraham wherefore
[1:11:33] did Sarah laugh saying shall I have
[1:11:35] assurity bear a child Jam old who said
[1:11:38] that the Lord said it right brother
[1:11:41] you'll hear Brother brand say that
[1:11:42] wasn't me that was him yeah right the
[1:11:44] Lord revealed the secrets of the hearts
[1:11:48] this was God in a flesh body revealing
[1:11:50] the secret of Sarah's heart and we're
[1:11:52] told that that would happen again in
[1:11:53] Luke 17:28
[1:11:55] it says likewise also as it was in the
[1:11:57] days of lot they did eat they drank they
[1:11:59] bought they sold they planted they build
[1:12:01] it but the same day that lot went out of
[1:12:03] Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from
[1:12:06] heaven and destroyed them all even thus
[1:12:09] shall it be in the day when the son of
[1:12:12] man is revealed the son of man the son
[1:12:15] of man not the Son of God he's been the
[1:12:17] Son of God all down through the church
[1:12:19] ages but now he's going to reveal
[1:12:21] himself as a son of man like he did to
[1:12:23] Abraham and time when lot was in Sodom
[1:12:27] and the fire was about to fall it was
[1:12:29] fulfilled in our day and God come down
[1:12:32] made the secrets of the hearts known and
[1:12:33] we'll get more into that as we uh maybe
[1:12:36] get further into this chapter and we
[1:12:38] know that that was one to a generation
[1:12:40] how many know that today and and and
[1:12:43] again we'll get further into it but
[1:12:45] brother BR said you might not be able to
[1:12:46] do this we have one of them in one
[1:12:49] generation one of them in one generation
[1:12:52] he said there was one Moses the rest of
[1:12:54] them just believe what he said again he
[1:12:57] said I don't say you're Pastor anybody
[1:12:59] would would take the gift to discernment
[1:13:00] they don't have to do that that's not
[1:13:02] their calling it's not they calling to
[1:13:04] do that to be one in an age one in an
[1:13:07] age so I don't have a pressure here to
[1:13:09] reveal the secrets of your heart we've
[1:13:10] already seen that but you see God moved
[1:13:13] in that part of his body to do that he
[1:13:16] he became flesh in that part of his body
[1:13:18] to do that what will he become flesh in
[1:13:20] my body to do well if I'm called to be a
[1:13:23] pastor he'll become flesh in my body to
[1:13:25] be a pastor he'll become flesh in your
[1:13:27] body maybe to be a housewife maybe to be
[1:13:29] a factory worker maybe to be a dad maybe
[1:13:31] to be a mom maybe to be a young person
[1:13:33] on fire for the Lord he becomes flesh in
[1:13:35] your body come on all right huh you said
[1:13:39] that's getting out there wait just a
[1:13:41] minute and I'll show it to
[1:13:42] you he wants to be revealed in your
[1:13:47] flesh not just one man now the son of
[1:13:50] man was revealed in the flesh of a
[1:13:51] prophet and so because he was a prophet
[1:13:55] he did what the Bible said he would do
[1:13:57] he was the prophet to the age when the
[1:13:59] son of man who is the word how many know
[1:14:02] that this morning the son of man is the
[1:14:05] word it's more important than you think
[1:14:06] it is and it matters more to our lives
[1:14:09] than we think it does the son of man who
[1:14:12] is the word when he's expressed in your
[1:14:14] life he he will produce reproduce the
[1:14:16] word in your life right come on now
[1:14:19] right he'll reproduce the word what does
[1:14:21] that look like he'll reproduce love joy
[1:14:23] peace longsuffering
[1:14:25] gentleness
[1:14:27] Faith right he reproduces that that
[1:14:30] don't mean you'll look like other
[1:14:31] message people that's not what that
[1:14:33] means at all it means you look like
[1:14:35] Christ huh we may have a message culture
[1:14:38] but that's not what we're called to
[1:14:39] we're called to look like Christ we're
[1:14:42] called to be Christ to the generation we
[1:14:43] live in Lord help me to be that and and
[1:14:47] if if the culture of the church doesn't
[1:14:49] agree with the word we go with the word
[1:14:50] if the culture of the message doesn't
[1:14:52] agree with the word we go with the word
[1:14:54] we don't do what what everybody else
[1:14:55] does we don't have to follow what
[1:14:57] everybody else does we follow the word
[1:15:00] because it's the son of man that come in
[1:15:01] our age and revealed
[1:15:04] himself sir he revealed him oh Church
[1:15:07] aren't you glad he did he revealed
[1:15:09] himself in our
[1:15:11] age Hallelujah he wants to reveal
[1:15:14] himself in your flesh as it was in the
[1:15:15] days of Noah so shall it be in the
[1:15:17] coming of the son of man as the days of
[1:15:18] lot modern Billy Graham and or Roberts
[1:15:21] it's those two a two other Angels yeah
[1:15:24] right men like
[1:15:26] them or Roberts Billy Graham went down
[1:15:29] to Sodom preached them
[1:15:30] sodomites blinded their eyes with the
[1:15:32] gospel one Angel stayed
[1:15:34] back messenger with Abraham and the
[1:15:37] elected group what kind of sign did he
[1:15:40] do what did Abraham call him Elohim God
[1:15:44] manifested in
[1:15:46] flesh Jesus showing that he himself God
[1:15:49] in him watch will be manifested in his
[1:15:53] bride
[1:15:55] yeah yeah in the last days yes sir
[1:15:59] hallelujah amen what is the mystery is
[1:16:03] Christ in you the hope of glory Christ
[1:16:07] in you he wants to be Christ in
[1:16:09] me Christ in
[1:16:11] you and what God did through a prophet
[1:16:14] in our generation is show us how
[1:16:16] possible that
[1:16:17] was right what was he doing to Abraham
[1:16:21] he was showing him oh God he was showing
[1:16:23] him that there was there was a reality
[1:16:25] to what he was about to experience he
[1:16:28] said Abraham it's time and a message
[1:16:30] come God come down our generation
[1:16:32] revealed the sign of the son of man to
[1:16:34] show us it's
[1:16:37] time it's time to become God in flesh
[1:16:40] but again I don't want you to overthink
[1:16:42] that yeah see God in flesh in your flesh
[1:16:46] may not go out and speak to every
[1:16:50] storm
[1:16:52] right because you're just part of the
[1:16:54] body yeah right he may use one member to
[1:16:57] speak to the storm but he may use you to
[1:16:59] comfort your children yeah to take care
[1:17:01] of your house yeah huh to do your
[1:17:05] work to support the church to to to help
[1:17:09] out to to clean the wash the dishes that
[1:17:12] may be God in
[1:17:14] flesh comfort those who need comforting
[1:17:17] yeah and you say well and you always
[1:17:20] know see when when we do what the word
[1:17:22] says then it's God in flesh and when
[1:17:23] it's not it's just flesh
[1:17:26] right cuz we still got that
[1:17:28] part right that that that flesh body
[1:17:31] that come to Abraham that was not born
[1:17:33] of a woman but brother Brandon was born
[1:17:34] of a woman right and I was born of a
[1:17:37] woman and so I've got a sticky nature
[1:17:40] and I and I'll say things and do things
[1:17:42] that aren't right but but when God is
[1:17:44] speaking when when I surrender to God
[1:17:47] God will always do what's
[1:17:49] right are you with me
[1:17:52] now so that's not Jesus wasn't Jesus
[1:17:56] talking to Abraham it was it was Christ
[1:18:00] it was pre-incarnate Christ but Jesus
[1:18:02] that what we think of as Jesus the son
[1:18:04] and not had been born but it was a man
[1:18:06] in human flesh and Abraham called Elohim
[1:18:08] the great
[1:18:09] Almighty showing as Jesus said well as
[1:18:12] it was in the days of Sodom watch close
[1:18:14] in the days of Sodom so will it be at
[1:18:16] the coming of the son of man when the
[1:18:17] son of man is being revealed not no more
[1:18:19] as a church but the bride is called and
[1:18:22] that day the son of man will be revealed
[1:18:23] what to join the church to the head to
[1:18:26] unite the marriage of the Bride he said
[1:18:28] the bridegroom call will come right
[1:18:30] through this when the son of man will
[1:18:31] come down and come in human flesh to
[1:18:34] unite the two together he said the
[1:18:37] church has to be the word he is the word
[1:18:40] and the two unites together and to do
[1:18:42] that it will take the manifestation of
[1:18:44] the revealing of the son of man not a
[1:18:46] clergyman he said do you see what I mean
[1:18:49] his son of man Jesus Christ will come
[1:18:51] down in human flesh Among Us and will
[1:18:53] make his word so real
[1:18:55] it'll unite the church and him as one
[1:18:57] the bribe and then she'll go home to the
[1:18:59] wedding supper she's already United he
[1:19:03] said we go to the wedding supper not the
[1:19:04] marriage he said because the marriage of
[1:19:06] the Lamb has come but the Rapture is
[1:19:08] going to the wedding supper when the
[1:19:10] word here unites with the person and
[1:19:13] they to become one he said and then what
[1:19:16] does it do then it manifests the son of
[1:19:19] man
[1:19:21] again what did he tell John in
[1:19:23] Revelation chapter 10:8 he said prophesy
[1:19:27] again what does it do it manifests the
[1:19:30] word again not his part of the word our
[1:19:33] portion of the word yes sir are you with
[1:19:36] me now yeah it manifests the son of man
[1:19:39] again not the church theologians the son
[1:19:40] of man the word and the church becomes
[1:19:43] one whatever the son of man done he was
[1:19:45] the word the church does the same thing
[1:19:49] so that's who appeared who was it it was
[1:19:52] God
[1:19:53] himself where did he appear he appears
[1:19:55] in the plains of
[1:19:57] memory Abraham was only here because he
[1:20:00] gave lot his choice and lot went to
[1:20:02] Sodom I want you to know that a prophet
[1:20:05] in our day even had to make a choice you
[1:20:07] got to make a choice right yes now let
[1:20:10] me be very clear to you I believe in
[1:20:11] predestination I believe in election but
[1:20:13] you got to make a choice right the Bible
[1:20:16] says choose you this day whom you will
[1:20:17] serve as for me in my house we will
[1:20:20] serve the Lord you got to make that
[1:20:23] choice you you can't stay in the valley
[1:20:26] of decision forever you got to make a
[1:20:29] choice and and he told the prophet
[1:20:31] because you've chosen the Narrow Path
[1:20:34] the harder way you walked of your own
[1:20:36] choosing that picked the correct and
[1:20:38] precise decision and it is my way
[1:20:41] because of this momentous decision a
[1:20:43] huge portion of Heaven awaits see what a
[1:20:45] glorious decision I made this in itself
[1:20:48] is that which will give and make come to
[1:20:49] pass the tremendous Victory and love
[1:20:51] divine what is that that is a choice
[1:20:54] that Prophet had to make God knew he
[1:20:56] would make it but he had to make it and
[1:20:59] you've got to make it and Abraham had to
[1:21:01] make it and when he made his choice and
[1:21:03] and allowed lot to go his way and he
[1:21:05] took the harder
[1:21:07] Road he become a candidate then for a
[1:21:10] body
[1:21:11] change God already knew he would do it
[1:21:14] but Abraham had to make a
[1:21:17] choice see the son of man is only
[1:21:19] revealed in you when you choose the
[1:21:20] harder path are you with me I wish I had
[1:21:23] a little bit more I've been I've been
[1:21:25] sick and I kind of that's my excuse this
[1:21:26] morning but I I have two reasons why
[1:21:30] it's difficult to breathe I'm fat and
[1:21:32] I'm and I've been
[1:21:34] sick but he made a choice are you
[1:21:37] hearing me today you got to make a
[1:21:40] choice and it's the choice that
[1:21:42] determines whether the son of man will
[1:21:44] be revealed in your life yes it's the
[1:21:48] choice that you make it's a choice I'm
[1:21:50] going to I'm going to go to church I'm
[1:21:52] not going to let people keep me out of
[1:21:54] the House of
[1:21:56] God I'm not going to let complexes keep
[1:21:59] me out of the house of God that's a
[1:22:01] choice that you got to make like Abraham
[1:22:03] made he said I'm going to go to church
[1:22:05] I'm going to serve God I'm going to do
[1:22:07] what's right I'm not going down there in
[1:22:08] Sodom I'm going to believe the message
[1:22:10] of the hour people might laugh at me
[1:22:12] people might think I'm funny and I dress
[1:22:13] funny and I look funny but I made a
[1:22:15] choice I'm going to serve God with all
[1:22:17] of my heart oh how many have made that
[1:22:19] choice this morning I'm going to serve
[1:22:21] God I'm going to love him with all of my
[1:22:23] heart I'm going to do do what the Bible
[1:22:25] says I'm going to follow the word you've
[1:22:27] got to make that
[1:22:29] choice and then the son of man begins to
[1:22:31] be revealed now the son of man is the
[1:22:33] word and the Word was revealed through a
[1:22:35] prophet but the word is also revealed
[1:22:37] through your life as you live now BR
[1:22:41] said the very day the son of man is
[1:22:42] revealed Revelation 10 1-7 he said read
[1:22:45] it when you get home the seventh Angel's
[1:22:46] message opening up the
[1:22:48] seals what is it not the angel is the
[1:22:50] son of man the messenger is revealing
[1:22:52] the son of man so brother Brandon was
[1:22:55] not the son of
[1:22:56] man he very emphatically said that if
[1:22:59] somebody teaches that it's just wrong
[1:23:01] he's not the son of man he's the a son
[1:23:04] of man revealing the son of man he said

[1:24:57] way the another translation puts it
[1:25:00] Yahweh which is the word the Hebrew word
[1:25:02] for God Yahweh the Lord appeared to him
[1:25:06] by The Oaks of mammory and he was
[1:25:10] sitting in the doorway of the tent at
[1:25:13] the heat of the day and I want you to
[1:25:16] understand where he was so we know who
[1:25:19] came to him and I want you to understand
[1:25:22] where he was he was he was in the right
[1:25:24] place at the right
[1:25:26] time he was under a shade tree In the
[1:25:30] Heat of the
[1:25:31] day all right this is important yeah he
[1:25:34] heard the word in the right atmosphere
[1:25:37] even though the day was
[1:25:40] hot and and this shade tree was we could
[1:25:43] say a fully restored bride tree that
[1:25:46] Abraham was sitting under brother BR
[1:25:48] said he was waiting years had passed the
[1:25:50] beauty had faded and Sarah was old and
[1:25:53] he was old and one day Abraham still
[1:25:56] keeping separated oh I love that he
[1:25:58] didn't quit his separation because he
[1:26:00] got old but he still kept his separation
[1:26:03] representing the Seed of Abraham today
[1:26:05] separated from the world called out set
[1:26:06] aside that's Christians real believing
[1:26:09] Christians set aside called out Abraham
[1:26:12] standing there on the hill things wasn't
[1:26:13] going too good he wasn't Rich he later
[1:26:16] become rich but he wasn't Rich at that
[1:26:18] time his cattle was starving lot was
[1:26:21] doing fine he was down in Sodom looked
[1:26:23] like lot made a better choice and there
[1:26:26] will be moments in your life for the
[1:26:27] land and where it looks like other
[1:26:29] people made better choices than you've
[1:26:30] made but you stay with your choice you
[1:26:32] stay with where God called you to why
[1:26:35] because you know that you're not looking
[1:26:37] at the moment you're looking for the
[1:26:38] future you're looking for your family
[1:26:40] you're looking for your children you're
[1:26:42] looking for for a body change one day
[1:26:44] you're looking for a Rapture one day
[1:26:46] it's not about today other people may
[1:26:48] have more friends today other people may
[1:26:50] have more money today other people might
[1:26:53] have bigger Church today there might be
[1:26:55] more exciting things going on but I'm
[1:26:57] not looking to today I'm looking for
[1:27:02] tomorrow I'm looking for tomorrow
[1:27:06] sir so I I made my
[1:27:09] choice you made your choice we're
[1:27:12] sitting there under the oak
[1:27:15] tree he said lot was doing fine and his
[1:27:18] daughters belong to all the societies
[1:27:20] and I my said I imagine they was just
[1:27:22] like sodomites what there they was down
[1:27:26] there in Sodom and one day while Abraham
[1:27:29] sat in the shade of the
[1:27:30] oak Oh Glory to God where his tent was
[1:27:34] pit he seen three men come walking he
[1:27:37] said there's just something about a
[1:27:38] Christian when you see Christ you can
[1:27:41] recognize the Bible tells us that we
[1:27:44] don't have time to go into it this
[1:27:45] morning but the Palmer worm and the
[1:27:47] Locust and the cankerworm and the
[1:27:49] caterpillar have eaten
[1:27:51] away excuse me
[1:27:56] fruit of God what brother the random
[1:27:58] calls the bride tree types it to that he
[1:28:00] said there were four messengers of death
[1:28:02] four messengers of life on the tree was
[1:28:05] fruits the Palmer worm be to eat away at
[1:28:07] the fruits I think I I put a slide on
[1:28:10] here for this I'm not yes the fruits of
[1:28:12] Palmer worm a brotherly kindness Joy he
[1:28:15] be to eat away at that the leaves that
[1:28:18] the Locust ate away The Fellowship of
[1:28:20] the the cooling Fellowship of the leaves
[1:28:22] and the cankerworm ate away the Doctrine
[1:28:24] which was the bark you'll find all this
[1:28:25] in restoration of the brid tree the the
[1:28:28] caterpillar ate away the pulp the life
[1:28:30] itself the spirit itself and so all
[1:28:34] these things were eaten away but the
[1:28:36] kind of tree I believe Abraham was
[1:28:37] sitting under was a restored tree that
[1:28:41] had its Spirit its life back had its
[1:28:43] Doctrine back had its Fellowship back
[1:28:47] and had its brotherly kindness and its
[1:28:49] joy and its fruits
[1:28:51] back so Abraham is sitting under the
[1:28:53] shade of of that tree and he recognizes
[1:28:55] that the one who is speaking is more
[1:28:57] than a man it's God speaking the promise
[1:29:00] of a changed
[1:29:01] body and that message become the method
[1:29:05] by which God will change his body just
[1:29:08] like this message is the method by which
[1:29:10] God will change our
[1:29:12] bodies and Genesis 18:14 says is
[1:29:15] anything too hard for the Lord all right
[1:29:17] oh I'm so glad that's the promise we
[1:29:19] have too at the time appointed I will
[1:29:21] return unto you according to the time of
[1:29:23] life and Sarah shall have a son and so
[1:29:26] what happened he was sitting under the
[1:29:28] tree at the right time in the shade oh
[1:29:31] it's important that we keep the right
[1:29:33] atmosphere here in the church it's
[1:29:35] important that we pray it's important
[1:29:36] that we call out to God you say if we're
[1:29:38] just waiting on the rapture we SE our
[1:29:40] last time what what are we doing here
[1:29:41] well we're staying under the tree yeah
[1:29:44] because In the Heat of the day you need
[1:29:45] the shade of the tree you need the shade
[1:29:48] of a good gospel meeting you need the
[1:29:50] shade of being in the house of God you
[1:29:52] need the comfort of being around the
[1:29:54] people of
[1:29:59] God get ready
[1:30:01] Abraham this your last sign he said
[1:30:03] according to the time of life Sarah
[1:30:05] shall have a
[1:30:06] son noce when he appeared he appeared in
[1:30:08] the
[1:30:09] heat the
[1:30:11] heat hot out I don't mean naturally I
[1:30:16] mean spiritually the heat is
[1:30:19] on and people do one of two things in in
[1:30:21] the
[1:30:22] heat either they come together at a
[1:30:25] cooling
[1:30:26] Source or they
[1:30:29] separate see the Bible Paul being a
[1:30:32] prophet he he foresaw this he said don't
[1:30:34] forsake the assembling of yourselves
[1:30:36] together as the manner of some is but
[1:30:39] exhorting one another so much more as
[1:30:41] you see the day approaching as it gets
[1:30:43] hotter right he said keep going to
[1:30:46] church yeah that's simple instructions
[1:30:49] isn't it but we needed it for this
[1:30:52] day brother BR said you know when the
[1:30:54] heat of the day is on the sheep all get
[1:30:56] together and they stand against one
[1:30:59] another and they make shade for each
[1:31:02] other and they support each other yes
[1:31:06] you know and and and to do that they get
[1:31:07] together and I don't know who you know
[1:31:09] there's always a leader right and the
[1:31:11] sheep and I don't know exactly how that
[1:31:13] works but one stands somewhere and then
[1:31:15] they all just stand where that one is I
[1:31:17] don't know why there's so many Believers
[1:31:19] in Hardy Arkansas no
[1:31:21] clue but but the Sheep just tend to
[1:31:23] stand together
[1:31:24] yeah right you said well why there why
[1:31:27] not why can't everybody stand at my
[1:31:29] house come to my house and and and and
[1:31:31] be shadeed for me well sheep just tend
[1:31:33] to come together because the important
[1:31:36] thing is not where it is but that they
[1:31:40] get the the support and the shade from
[1:31:42] each other brother B said that's the way
[1:31:45] the Sheep of God should do is kind of
[1:31:48] Stand Together close places
[1:31:52] yeah close
[1:31:54] places and support one another with our
[1:31:56] faith I don't like close
[1:31:58] places I'm a little bit claustrophobic
[1:32:01] and the bigger I get the the more
[1:32:03] claustrophobic I get we went up in the
[1:32:06] arch how many have ever been in the Arch
[1:32:08] in St Louis that's a close
[1:32:12] place they put you in this little
[1:32:14] elevator but it's not really you get in
[1:32:16] this little
[1:32:17] ball and and you have to bend down to
[1:32:20] get in there and I sit in there and I'm
[1:32:21] all scrunched up like this I'm sitting
[1:32:24] like this and I that door
[1:32:28] closes and I'll be honest with you I
[1:32:30] panicked just a little
[1:32:32] bit because I thought there's nothing
[1:32:34] they can do if this thing quits working
[1:32:37] and this thing was made in the
[1:32:40] 60s I mean it's got 60s designed I
[1:32:43] thought this thing if this thing quits
[1:32:44] working I'm
[1:32:46] done I mean if it stops and you know how
[1:32:49] it kind of slows down at the end I I'd
[1:32:52] be over you you'd have a they have to
[1:32:54] put me in a
[1:32:56] home cuz I couldn't have sit there well
[1:32:59] the week after we left that thing broke
[1:33:03] down I'm reading in the paper I said
[1:33:05] Britney look at this and you think I'm
[1:33:06] bad
[1:33:10] you we didn't tell Britney how small
[1:33:12] them things were before we got on
[1:33:16] it and all five of us in one of them
[1:33:18] little pods and I thought well that's a
[1:33:20] I don't like close places but sometimes
[1:33:23] you need to get in close places
[1:33:26] uncomfortable sometimes it makes you
[1:33:27] uncomfortable to be around people but
[1:33:29] you need people you need your brothers
[1:33:31] and sisters and and so sometimes you got
[1:33:33] to support one another you got to get in
[1:33:35] a close place or you're never going to
[1:33:36] see The View and the view was tremendous
[1:33:39] by the way I recommend it I don't
[1:33:42] recommend the
[1:33:45] transportation but if you want to see it
[1:33:47] there's only one way to see it get in
[1:33:50] close places
[1:33:54] oh Church brother B said sheep are funny
[1:33:56] little creatures in one way there's
[1:33:58] another thing we might learn of sheep
[1:33:59] tonight when the weather's real hot he
[1:34:01] said did you ever see sheep they won't
[1:34:02] separate themselves one be at one place
[1:34:04] and one at another but Right In the Heat
[1:34:06] of the day the Sheep will all stand
[1:34:12] together all stand together you know
[1:34:15] what they're doing they're making shade
[1:34:17] one for the other they're having
[1:34:20] fellowship and a lot of times our
[1:34:21] response to getting hurt is to separate
[1:34:24] ourselves but that's exactly what the
[1:34:25] devil wants us to do because then that's
[1:34:28] when the wolf
[1:34:29] attacks right but when we get hurt we
[1:34:32] have to we have to risk being hurt more
[1:34:35] but that's God's method of
[1:34:39] healing oh Church listen he said I'm
[1:34:42] just trying to be a pastor this morning
[1:34:43] to help you and somebody helps me know
[1:34:46] these things he said now someone said is
[1:34:48] that necessary brother brandom it
[1:34:49] certainly is is that necessary it
[1:34:52] certainly is there's nothing like having
[1:34:54] a real good Dependable friend when the
[1:34:56] troubles are blazing and the heat's on
[1:34:58] you can go to this friend and sit down
[1:35:00] and just explain it to them talk it over
[1:35:03] in personal confidence and kneel down
[1:35:05] and pray together and know that this
[1:35:06] person is a good God saved man or woman
[1:35:08] you can put confidence in I don't think
[1:35:09] we should wait necessarily on them to
[1:35:11] come to us I think we ought to go to our
[1:35:13] friend I think that's the same way with
[1:35:15] God we need to go to our friend we need
[1:35:17] to talk to him we need we need to we
[1:35:19] need to sit down right there with him
[1:35:21] and get close to him go to a friend you
[1:35:23] say well they didn't come to me well go
[1:35:25] anyway
[1:35:27] that's it's good to do that come let us
[1:35:29] reason together say the scripture come
[1:35:31] let us Stand
[1:35:33] Together see if you want friends you got
[1:35:35] to huddle with the Sheep Bible says a
[1:35:37] man that has friends must show himself
[1:35:39] friendly but there is a friend that
[1:35:41] sticketh closer than a brother I'm so
[1:35:43] glad for for Christ so glad for the Holy
[1:35:46] Ghost aren't you because when you don't
[1:35:48] have friends or it seemed like you're
[1:35:49] all alone he said I'm the Good Shepherd
[1:35:51] of the sheep and maybe you find yourself
[1:35:53] all caught off all by yourself he said
[1:35:55] I'm coming after you I'll leave the 99
[1:35:58] and I'll come after you aren't you glad
[1:36:00] he's willing to do that today aren't you
[1:36:02] glad he's that kind of a shepherd He
[1:36:04] said I want to come after you even when
[1:36:07] you get away from the other sheep I want
[1:36:09] I still want you I still I still want to
[1:36:11] be your friend right
[1:36:14] amen Jesus told his disciples he said
[1:36:16] henceforth I call you not servants for
[1:36:19] the servant knoweth not what his Lord
[1:36:20] doeth but I've called you friends all
[1:36:23] things I I've have heard of my father
[1:36:24] I've made known to
[1:36:25] you br said was right In the Heat of the
[1:36:28] day yeah about 3 or 4:00 in the
[1:36:31] afternoon I suppose when the Western Sun
[1:36:33] was shining down hot there in Canaan the
[1:36:35] direct rays of that heat can raise
[1:36:37] blisters quickly so you can't sit out in
[1:36:40] that heat you get
[1:36:42] burnt he was sitting out there in the
[1:36:44] tent door with his head down perhaps
[1:36:46] studying or thinking about God he raised
[1:36:49] up his eyes and he seen three men coming
[1:36:52] oh I love this and somehow Abraham
[1:36:55] wanted to be
[1:36:57] friendly he had this experience with God
[1:37:00] out of a desire to be friendly brother
[1:37:03] Joe that's a blessing in your life that
[1:37:05] you want to go talk to people Abraham
[1:37:07] just wanted to go talk to these men it's
[1:37:10] a blessing to be hospitable it's a
[1:37:12] blessing to want and some of us are I
[1:37:14] myself I'm not a guy that wants to go do
[1:37:17] that but I realize it's
[1:37:18] necessary like like I need to reach out
[1:37:21] I need to get out beyond my shell
[1:37:23] sometimes what is it it's a blessing
[1:37:25] Abraham wanted to be friendly so he
[1:37:27] thought them fellas walk kind of strange
[1:37:29] yet Dusty from the road an ordinarily
[1:37:31] dressed and they come walking up and
[1:37:33] Abraham went out and invited them
[1:37:36] otherwise something like this s you're
[1:37:38] tired your feet must be weary he said no
[1:37:41] I have a nice shade tree here won't you
[1:37:44] come in and sit down under the shade
[1:37:46] tree I'll fetch a little water I'll wash
[1:37:49] your feet for you it'll refresh you get
[1:37:52] you a cold drink then you can go on your
[1:37:53] journey Abraham was friendly and he
[1:37:56] became God's friend did you know that
[1:37:59] the Bible calls Abraham the friend of
[1:38:01] God James 2:23 the scripture was
[1:38:03] fulfilled which says Abraham believed
[1:38:05] God and was imputed unto him for
[1:38:07] righteousness and he was called the
[1:38:09] friend of
[1:38:11] God I want to be his friend today don't
[1:38:14] you Abraham sitting out there not
[1:38:17] expecting anything he was in the poorest
[1:38:18] of the land it was In the Heat of the
[1:38:21] day an odd time for something to happen
[1:38:24] but he seen a man come walking three of
[1:38:26] them something in his heart told him it
[1:38:28] was God and he held on to it he wouldn't
[1:38:31] let them pass by he said oh God May that
[1:38:34] happen here I say may it happen this
[1:38:36] morning don't let it pass by hold on to
[1:38:39] it come in sit down under the oak I'll
[1:38:41] fetch a little water I'll be a servant
[1:38:43] to you let me wash your feet I'll bring
[1:38:45] you a morsel of bread you satisfy your
[1:38:47] soul and then you may go on for this
[1:38:51] reason my Lord Has Come to Me In not too
[1:38:53] sure but he knew that there was
[1:38:55] something sparked in his heart it must
[1:38:58] be the
[1:38:59] time oh Church there was Abraham that
[1:39:02] called out having life kind of hard
[1:39:04] persecuted made fun of sitting out in
[1:39:06] the wilderness on the bare ground in the
[1:39:08] shade of the oak tree but when the hour
[1:39:11] of the message came oh I love it he
[1:39:13] looked out in the heat of the day and he
[1:39:15] seen three men coming up dust all over
[1:39:17] their clothes and Abraham looked again
[1:39:19] he knew there was just something about
[1:39:20] it a real Born Again child of God knows
[1:39:23] the spirit of God when it strikes yes
[1:39:25] sir my sheep knew my voice it was just
[1:39:27] like any other service it was just like
[1:39:28] any other day it was just like any other
[1:39:30] hour but that morning in that in that
[1:39:32] Sunday morning service he looked around
[1:39:34] and he was sitting under the oak tree in
[1:39:36] the shade of the service and he sees
[1:39:38] something happen he said Lord today I'm
[1:39:40] going to entertain you Lord what is it
[1:39:42] that you have need of what is it that
[1:39:44] you want let me wash your feet and when
[1:39:46] he
[1:39:47] did oh church when he begin to entertain
[1:39:50] the angel what happened yeah God began
[1:39:54] to speak yes said it's coming the
[1:39:59] message that he believed all those years
[1:40:00] became real to his heart
[1:40:04] right it was hot I'm closing now in just
[1:40:08] a
[1:40:09] moment he might have been
[1:40:13] ill-tempered CU you get that way when
[1:40:14] it's hot I know I do nothing worse than
[1:40:19] being too
[1:40:21] hot come on that's why we crank his
[1:40:24] temperature down in here I know some of
[1:40:26] y'all is sitting there thinking oh right
[1:40:28] now I'm cold but there ain't nothing
[1:40:30] worse than being too hot because when
[1:40:31] you get hot you fall
[1:40:33] asleep and I hate to sleep during the
[1:40:36] day because something might
[1:40:40] happen what happened Sarah was tired she
[1:40:44] was in a bad
[1:40:46] mood Abraham might have been
[1:40:49] ill-tempered but he was under in the
[1:40:51] right place sir at the right time he had
[1:40:55] the right
[1:40:57] response I say this morning is the right
[1:41:00] place and the right
[1:41:02] time what will our response be who was
[1:41:06] it the son of man I know I've dwelt on
[1:41:08] just a little part of this this morning
[1:41:11] but it's the son of man wants to reveal
[1:41:13] himself where where under a rest stored
[1:41:15] brid tree When In the Heat of the day
[1:41:19] yeah huh in the darkness of Le to Sea
[1:41:21] brother BR tells a story musician go
[1:41:23] ahead and come the Rand tells a story
[1:41:25] about about animals in India he tells it
[1:41:28] in several
[1:41:29] places he said there was a great
[1:41:31] earthquake about to come and he when he
[1:41:33] went to India he read in the paper that
[1:41:35] said the earthquake must be over because
[1:41:37] the animals are going
[1:41:39] back and he said what had happened is
[1:41:43] that when the earthquake was coming or
[1:41:45] the days before it happened he said all
[1:41:48] the all the animals he said In the Heat
[1:41:51] of the day
[1:41:53] they left the walls which normally
[1:41:56] during the heat of the day they would
[1:41:58] actually stay against the walls the
[1:42:01] man-made structure that was there that
[1:42:04] would keep them cool but he said these
[1:42:06] animals in the heat of the day they left
[1:42:08] the man-made structure and they come out
[1:42:09] in the middle of the field and they all
[1:42:12] huddled
[1:42:13] together go go you can go read where he
[1:42:16] says he said that the Sheep left every
[1:42:17] man-made shelter and stood together in
[1:42:19] the middle of the field yeah brother
[1:42:22] brand picks that up he said can't you
[1:42:24] see Spirit-filled people something is
[1:42:26] fixing to happen all right oh my there's
[1:42:29] an earthquake coming sodom's about to
[1:42:32] get
[1:42:33] burnt it's time to huddle
[1:42:38] together it's time yeah so I'm afraid
[1:42:42] that maybe I won't fit in with the rest
[1:42:44] of the sheep all the rest of the sheep
[1:42:45] are that way too you
[1:42:47] know we're all just a little
[1:42:50] odd we couldn't be bride
[1:42:53] we the Oddball
[1:42:57] right and and I think we need to be more
[1:43:00] open with each
[1:43:02] other I think people need to recognize
[1:43:05] that brother Brandon was a human I'm a
[1:43:07] human there's only one man that was ever
[1:43:09] lived a perfect life as a human that was
[1:43:11] Jesus
[1:43:14] Christ we need to recognize we need one
[1:43:17] another I may get irritated at you but I
[1:43:20] need
[1:43:21] you you might get irrit iritated at me
[1:43:23] but you need
[1:43:28] me may not like everything about you I
[1:43:30] may get tired you know the Bible says
[1:43:32] talks about a friend if you continue to
[1:43:33] come to a friend's house you know
[1:43:34] eventually you get wear out you're
[1:43:36] welcome but but we need each other
[1:43:41] right we need one another we we need to
[1:43:44] stand together In the Heat of the day
[1:43:46] that's what breaks my heart when I see
[1:43:48] people fracturing and let's promote this
[1:43:50] church or that one that's not what we're
[1:43:52] about let's get out in the middle of the
[1:43:54] field Stand Together In the Heat of the
[1:43:57] day we need one
[1:43:59] another he said don't look for some
[1:44:01] great big Universal something sweeping
[1:44:04] nothing but the coming of the Lord Jesus
[1:44:07] he said remember just remember the words
[1:44:10] and the promise of the Lord won't you
[1:44:13] come on in right quick get away from
[1:44:16] them big walls the resurrection is near
[1:44:19] at hand
[1:44:20] now I want you to notice this is there
[1:44:23] to play something softly mamory was in
[1:44:26] the place of the
[1:44:29] Resurrection where Abraham was sitting
[1:44:32] in the tent of the day he later bought
[1:44:34] that
[1:44:36] [Music]
[1:44:38] field for Sarah to be buried in and when
[1:44:41] he died he was buried in that same
[1:44:44] field and there was a place where job
[1:44:47] was buried it oh church it was the same
[1:44:51] place where where where Joseph said said
[1:44:53] don't leave my bones in Egypt take me
[1:44:56] back you remember the story brother
[1:44:59] brother brother BR brings it out how
[1:45:01] that Abraham bought the cave in the
[1:45:03] field of
[1:45:04] mpil that that's in that same plane of
[1:45:08] mammory the area of Hebron in in the in
[1:45:12] Israel if you go look at it today it
[1:45:16] it's in the West Bank you realize why
[1:45:17] Israel can't give up their property
[1:45:19] their rights because if they have a
[1:45:21] two-state solution and every just hunky
[1:45:23] dory and there's a Palestinian State
[1:45:24] Israeli State Israel no longer owns that
[1:45:27] spot
[1:45:30] right they would be giving up that spot
[1:45:33] you realize well there can't be no
[1:45:35] peace oh church because that's a literal
[1:45:39] land but we don't have a literal land we
[1:45:41] have we we are buried in Christ brother

[1:45:54] place he's going to raise me from that's
[1:45:57] the place where the Rapture told church

[1:46:00] happened when when when Jesus was
[1:46:02] crucified and the graves were open
