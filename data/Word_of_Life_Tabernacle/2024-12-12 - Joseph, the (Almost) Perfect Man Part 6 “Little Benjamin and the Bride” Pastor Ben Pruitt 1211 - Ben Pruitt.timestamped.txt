[46:24] a a help to people and and uh and that
[46:27] would be right with the message of the
[46:30] hour and that's on our heart so Genesis
[46:33] 41 and
[46:37] 41 this is just real good stuff in here
[46:40] tonight it's not something anything that
[46:41] you don't know but it's real good uh
[46:44] real good word and I I'm just thankful
[46:46] for the word of God it's what we live
[46:47] off of that's what we feed on is the
[46:50] word of God Genesis
[46:52] 41:41 and Pharaoh said unto Joseph see I
[46:56] have set the over all the land of Egypt
[47:00] and Pharaoh took off his ring from his
[47:02] hand and put it upon Joseph's hand and
[47:05] arrayed him in vestures of fine linen
[47:07] and put a gold chain about his neck and
[47:10] he made him to ride in the second
[47:11] Chariot which he had and they cried
[47:13] before him bow the knee and he made him
[47:16] ruler over all the land of Egypt and
[47:19] Pharaoh said unto Joseph I am Pharaoh
[47:21] without the shall no man lift up his
[47:23] hand or foot in all the land of Egypt
[47:26] and Pharaoh called Joseph's name zna pan
[47:29] and he gave him to wife asth the
[47:31] daughter of pipera priest of an and
[47:35] Joseph went out over all the land of
[47:37] Egypt Joseph was 30 years old when he
[47:40] stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt and
[47:42] Joseph went out from the presence of
[47:44] pharaoh and went throughout all the land
[47:47] of Egypt I pray the Lord would add his
[47:49] Blessing to the word you may be
[47:52] seated Joseph types Christ in many ways
[47:56] but as especially in this episode of his
[47:59] life we know that Abraham had uh
[48:02] children several children other than
[48:04] Isaac but Isaac was the promised son so
[48:07] you begin to see a uh kind of a
[48:09] narrowing down a focus on Isaac and away
[48:12] from ishmail and Abraham's other
[48:15] children and we know that Isaac had both
[48:18] Esau and Jacob and you see that Jacob
[48:21] have I loved and Esau have I hated so
[48:23] there's a narrowing down of that as well
[48:27] but then Jacob had 12 sons but those 12
[48:30] sons together would be the foundation of
[48:34] the children of Israel they would all be
[48:37] elect if we could think of it that way
[48:40] they would all be Israel they would all
[48:43] be Jacob's children and so that was how
[48:46] God would make the tribes and the things
[48:48] of Israel now that was where the promise
[48:50] would go to and and yet they didn't get
[48:53] along we found that out and and there
[48:56] was something something done that was
[48:57] terrible they sold uh Joseph into
[49:00] slavery we know that 10 of Jacob's sons
[49:03] were half brothers and were either
[49:06] involved in either the plot to sell
[49:08] Joseph into slavery or the cover up the
[49:12] only exception to that was Benjamin
[49:15] Benjamin wasn't involved because he
[49:18] wasn't yet born he was the only son uh
[49:22] of uh Jacob's actually that was born in
[49:25] the promised land you find in Genesis
[49:29] 3518 it says it's speaking of the time
[49:32] that uh that Rachel or or that uh uh his
[49:36] mother died and and as she uh came to
[49:39] pass as her soul was in departing for
[49:41] she died she called his name benon but
[49:44] his father called him Benjamin and benon
[49:48] means son of my sorrow Benjamin is son
[49:50] of my right hand and Rachel died and was
[49:52] buried in the way to ephrath which is
[49:54] Bethlehem so they were in the promised
[49:57] land at that time but the other 12 sons
[49:59] weren't born in the promised land they
[50:01] were born actually back at at Jacob's
[50:05] original home where he had met uh his
[50:08] wife and where he had where he had uh
[50:11] tried to he had worked all those years
[50:13] to get uh his two wives and so Genesis
[50:16] 35:23 says the sons of Leah were Reuben
[50:19] and Simeon and Levi and Judah and
[50:21] isachar and zebulun the sons of Rachel
[50:24] or Joseph and Benjamin and the son of
[50:27] Bal uh were Dan and nap the son of zilpa
[50:31] was Gad and Asher and it says these are
[50:33] the sons of Jacob which were born to him
[50:35] in Pat and arum except for Benjamin
[50:37] that's the inference there Pat and arum
[50:40] is where Rachel and Leah were from
[50:42] Benjamin was actually born in Joseph's
[50:44] absence and you're sitting there right
[50:46] now thinking what in the world why does
[50:48] this matter well it matters because a
[50:51] it's a type of the 144,000 Jews who had
[50:55] nothing to do do with the crucifixion of
[50:58] Christ who were born in his absence and
[51:02] so they were uh born in a different
[51:05] season and yet yet Joseph would would uh
[51:09] bring Redemption to them if we could put
[51:11] it that way he would find a way to to
[51:14] express himself to them and and reveal
[51:17] himself to them now I I'd made kind of a
[51:20] a mistake actually earlier in this
[51:22] series and I'll just own up to it how
[51:24] many human beings do we have here are we
[51:27] all human the rest of you I don't know
[51:29] what you are I actually made a mistake
[51:31] because I had speculated and that's not
[51:33] a good thing to do had speculated that
[51:36] one of the reasons why there was
[51:37] partiality in in Jacob's family was
[51:40] because his wife had passed away and it
[51:42] appears that that's the case if you look
[51:44] at the chronology of the scriptures but
[51:47] it puts Rachel's death before the story
[51:49] of Joseph right but that's not actually
[51:52] when she died she actually died after
[51:55] after Joseph left when we know that
[51:57] because of Genesis
[51:59] 3710 when he was telling his father his
[52:02] dream you remember this this verse he
[52:04] said his father rebuked him and said
[52:05] unto him what is this dream that th that
[52:08] thou H has dreamed shall I and thy
[52:10] mother see she's not dead she's living
[52:13] shall I and thy mother and thy Brethren
[52:15] indeed come to bow down ourselves to
[52:18] thee to the Earth and again it matters
[52:20] because Benjamin had to be born in the
[52:23] absence of Joseph brother brandom
[52:27] kind of draws down on that point he said
[52:29] his little brother that had been born
[52:30] into the family after he had been gone
[52:33] he said see by his mother the first
[52:35] church the Orthodox Church the 144,000
[52:38] were born in his absence while he was
[52:41] away to get his Gentile bride you
[52:43] remember when Jesus died the Jews said
[52:45] let his blood be on us and our children
[52:48] remember that right let his blood be on
[52:52] us and our children what were they
[52:54] saying they were saying you know there's
[52:56] nothing to it and it won't matter
[52:58] there'll never be any kind of
[53:00] recrimination from this but there was we
[53:03] found that the Jews suffered for
[53:04] hundreds even thousands of years and
[53:07] culminating in the Holocaust when they
[53:08] were slaughtered we find the Jews under
[53:12] the altar that were given white robes
[53:14] which is a direct parallel to Joseph
[53:17] giving robes to his brothers and
[53:19] especially the little Benjamin but they
[53:22] were and the random draws that parallel
[53:23] in the fifth seal but you find that
[53:27] they were they they had they they had
[53:29] had happened to them they paid for what
[53:32] they did just like we pay in this life
[53:34] for what we do right if you do something
[53:37] that's wrong if you sow a certain thing
[53:40] you reap that thing but I'm so glad for
[53:42] Grace tonight that looks even beyond
[53:44] that and look to that little Benjamin
[53:46] said well it wasn't their fault they
[53:48] were born in the absence and there still
[53:51] out of that Orthodox Church comes
[53:54] 144,000 Jews who will be saved as a
[53:57] nation at the end time born in the land
[54:01] right Born in the land the only
[54:03] generation don't you see why they had to
[54:05] come back into the land they had to be
[54:07] born in the land like Benjamin was and
[54:10] they had to be born in the land in the
[54:11] absence of Joseph while he's dealing
[54:15] with his Gentile bride aren't you glad
[54:17] he chose to deal with us he didn't have
[54:19] to but he chose to deal with us so in
[54:22] his absence he deals with his Gentile
[54:25] bride but he hasn't forgotten his family
[54:29] he hasn't forgotten his chosen people
[54:32] what's he going to do he's going to call
[54:34] 144,000 of them after he turns back to
[54:38] the Jews after we're gone now so they're
[54:41] born in the land born in his absence
[54:43] Revelation 7 and one tells us the story
[54:46] excuse me tonight I'm struggling with my
[54:48] voice to preaching Sunday but you just
[54:50] had to bear with me it says after these
[54:53] things I saw four Angels standing on the
[54:56] four corners of the Earth holding the
[54:58] Four Winds of the earth that the wind
[54:59] should not blow on the earth nor in the
[55:01] sea nor in any tree and I saw another
[55:03] Angel ascending from the East having the
[55:05] Seal of the Living God and he cried with
[55:07] a loud voice to the Four Angels whom it
[55:10] was given to hurt the earth and the Sea
[55:12] saying hurt not the Earth neither the
[55:14] sea nor the trees till we have sealed
[55:16] the Servants of God in their foreheads
[55:18] so he's saying don't destroy the Earth
[55:20] with the Winds of
[55:22] War right brother Brandon said this
[55:24] happened in World War I he said don't
[55:27] destroy the Earth with the Winds of War
[55:29] with the mustard gas and the and the and
[55:32] atomic weapons and all the things they
[55:34] were building up to he said that war
[55:36] just stopped suddenly right and with no
[55:39] explanation it was just a war of
[55:41] attrition that would have just kept
[55:42] going and but it stopped what was it it
[55:44] was the mercy of God God said don't
[55:47] destroy the Earth because there's got to
[55:48] be a nation of Israel right there's got
[55:51] to be a people born in the land there's
[55:53] got to be 144,000 that will be sealed so
[55:56] he said don't hurt the Earth he said I
[55:58] heard the number of them which were
[55:59] sealed they were sealed
[56:02] 144,000 of all the tribes of the
[56:05] children of Israel there would there
[56:07] would be 12,000 from each tribe except
[56:10] for Dan and Ephraim if you go into the
[56:13] seventh seal brother B talks about that
[56:15] their names were blotted out under the
[56:17] heavens for idolatry and Joseph and Levi
[56:20] were substituted in their place so again
[56:23] they're paying for what they did right
[56:26] right their names are blotted out but
[56:28] brother Brown said in the Millennium the
[56:30] tribes are back in order because in the
[56:32] Millennium is when all wrongs are made
[56:34] right every knot that's been tied that
[56:37] we we things that we did that we
[56:39] couldn't change we couldn't untie he
[56:40] said it'll be untied in the
[56:43] Millennium so Joseph is raised from the
[56:46] pit he's he takes a gentile wife in
[56:50] Genesis
[56:51] 41:45 and Pharaoh called Joseph's name
[56:53] zapa pan I don't know if I'm I'm
[56:56] pronouncing that right but I figure none
[56:58] of us know how to pronounce it so we'll
[57:00] just say that's it and he gave him to
[57:03] wife ath the daughter of poera priest of
[57:06] an and Joseph went out over all the land
[57:09] of Egypt it's interesting Joseph's
[57:11] Egyptian name means Savior and revealer
[57:15] of Secrets I believe that's what he is
[57:17] to us see we he had a name that he was
[57:21] given when he come to Earth the the type
[57:23] or the antitype of Christ when he come
[57:25] to the Earth he said she shall bring
[57:26] forth a son and thou shalt call his name
[57:30] Jesus for he shall save his people from
[57:32] their sins what is Jesus Savior savior
[57:35] Jehovah's savior so he takes a wife from
[57:38] a pagan background his brothers wouldn't
[57:42] have understood that the Jews would have
[57:44] never understood the gospel going to the
[57:47] Gentiles it was completely antithetical
[57:50] to what they were and what they had been
[57:51] taught about their own specialness they
[57:54] they just didn't understand it they
[57:56] wouldn't have they wouldn't have
[57:58] received it so what does God do God
[58:00] blinds his people for the purpose of
[58:03] saving us I I'm so grateful for the
[58:07] mercy of God tonight he blinds his own
[58:10] people for the purpose of saving people
[58:13] who were walking around with clubs on
[58:14] their backs we can say it that way
[58:16] people who didn't have any knowledge of
[58:18] God people who had no understanding at
[58:20] all we were Romans or or tribal people
[58:23] of some kind we we didn't have any
[58:25] understanding of God we were not a part
[58:27] of anything that happened in the Old
[58:29] Testament but God rich in Mercy opened
[58:31] up a door of Mercy to the Gentiles and
[58:35] said I'm going to while I'm in Egypt I'm
[58:37] going to focus my time and my attention
[58:39] on my Gentile wife right so he come down
[58:45] to buy our Redemption but he also bought
[58:48] Israel's Redemption Israel is God's
[58:51] people we are his wife but Israel is
[58:55] God's people
[58:56] listen and and again he blinded his own
[58:58] people to graft his wife into the Plan
[59:01] of Redemption he said well I don't
[59:02] understand that look how beautifully
[59:04] Paul puts it in Romans chapter 11 Romans
[59:07] 11:1 I say then hath God Cast Away his
[59:09] people God forbid God don't work like
[59:12] that that ought to give some of his
[59:14] courage tonight as God Cast Away his
[59:16] people God forbid for I also am an
[59:19] Israelite of the Seed of Abraham of The
[59:21] Tribe of Benjamin he said God ha not
[59:24] Cast Away his people which she fornew
[59:27] watch you not what the scripture saith
[59:29] of Elias how he maketh intercession to
[59:31] God against Israel saying Lord they've
[59:33] killed that prophets and dig down the
[59:34] altars and I'm left alone they seek my
[59:37] life but what say the answer of God unto
[59:38] him I've reserved to myself 7,000 men
[59:42] not bow the knee to the image of Baal so
[59:43] he says within Israel there's always a
[59:46] Remnant that will be saved right and
[59:49] even in Paul's time there was a Remnant
[59:51] he represented that Remnant that would
[59:53] be saved but at the end time there's
[59:55] 144,00 will be saved as a
[59:58] nation but now look he says he said even
[1:00:01] so then at this present time also there
[1:00:03] is a Remnant according to the election
[1:00:07] of Grace but the brown was always very
[1:00:08] careful with that he said all Israel be
[1:00:11] saved everyone written in the name in
[1:00:12] the Lamb's Book of Life then they'll all
[1:00:15] be saved verse 11 Romans 11:11 says I
[1:00:18] say then have they stumbled that they
[1:00:20] should fall God forbid I love Paul's
[1:00:23] language there he said God just don't
[1:00:25] you don't don't understand God at all if
[1:00:27] you think they stumbled that they should
[1:00:29] fall that that's not how God works God
[1:00:31] keeps what he calls what he forne he
[1:00:34] predestines what he predestines he he
[1:00:37] glorifies he he's not going to lose a
[1:00:39] one that's that's our God he's that big
[1:00:42] that he's able to do
[1:00:44] that if he's able to lose you he
[1:00:46] wouldn't be
[1:00:47] God right and you say well isn't my
[1:00:50] choice absolutely it is but he's able to
[1:00:53] influence you in such a way and such
[1:00:56] with such overwhelming Grace that you
[1:00:58] couldn't do anything else we find that
[1:01:00] over and over again in the
[1:01:02] scripture he doesn't come that come and
[1:01:05] change your free moral agency but he he
[1:01:07] he knew that you would believe and he
[1:01:09] causes you to believe puts something in
[1:01:11] you to believe
[1:01:13] with so he said again he said salv
[1:01:18] rather through their fall salvation has
[1:01:21] come to the Gentiles for to provoke them
[1:01:23] to jealousy he said now the fall of of
[1:01:26] them be the riches of the world and see
[1:01:29] God's fixing to do something great
[1:01:31] something Great's about to happen but
[1:01:34] the great thing that's going to happen
[1:01:35] that the world's going to see is not
[1:01:37] going to happen to us it's going to
[1:01:40] happen to the
[1:01:41] Jews right the great thing that happens
[1:01:43] to us is we're going home but the
[1:01:45] world's not going to see that they're
[1:01:47] not even going to know it
[1:01:49] happened right when if you're looking
[1:01:51] for the message to become widely
[1:01:53] accepted in the world as far as I know
[1:01:55] that's ever supposed to happen right
[1:01:58] we're supposed to be a small group that
[1:02:00] that's who we are we're a tithing of the
[1:02:02] earth a portion of a portion the elect
[1:02:05] of the elect where people that that
[1:02:07] God's going to call home in a moment in
[1:02:09] a twinkling of an eye and people won't
[1:02:11] even know they'll go on having church
[1:02:12] and going doing what they're doing
[1:02:14] people won't even know it happened
[1:02:16] except for those that are very very
[1:02:18] close to us would be the only ones that
[1:02:20] would know but here is something that
[1:02:23] people are going to know he said If the
[1:02:25] fall be the riches of the world and the
[1:02:27] diminishing of them The Riches of the
[1:02:30] Gentiles how much more their
[1:02:32] fullness right and Paul deals with
[1:02:35] Gentile
[1:02:36] arrogance if you could be grafted he
[1:02:39] said they can be grafted in again I
[1:02:41] won't read all of those verses but he
[1:02:43] basically tells us don't be arrogant
[1:02:45] because you were grafted in because just
[1:02:47] the same as you were grafted in they can
[1:02:50] be grafted in
[1:02:51] again because they're God's people he
[1:02:54] doesn't he doesn't forsake his people
[1:02:56] but this very interesting to me because
[1:02:59] he said If the fall of them would be the
[1:03:01] riches of the world how much more their
[1:03:03] fullness and it it makes you wonder what
[1:03:05] happens during that time of the
[1:03:07] tribulation period and what all how all
[1:03:09] that goes into the to the ones who are
[1:03:12] uh who make it through the tribulation
[1:03:14] period and give their lives you know the
[1:03:16] church right because the church don't go
[1:03:19] in the Rapture of the Bride does but
[1:03:21] when I I wonder how many of them will
[1:03:23] see what God's doing with the Jews and
[1:03:25] recognize what hour it is right now
[1:03:28] think about it cuz God won't be working
[1:03:30] with them but they'll see what he's
[1:03:32] doing with the Jews because the whole
[1:03:34] world will see it Romans 11:25 for I
[1:03:37] would not Brethren that you should be
[1:03:39] ignorant of this mystery Le you should
[1:03:42] be wise in your own conceits that
[1:03:43] blindness in part is happened to Israel
[1:03:47] until the fullness of the Gentiles be
[1:03:49] com in so that's where brother brand
[1:03:50] says that last one right he said that
[1:03:53] last one's got to come in he might be
[1:03:55] your neighbor he might be one of our
[1:03:57] children sitting here right or she it
[1:03:59] might be might be somebody down the
[1:04:01] street it might be somebody in Africa we
[1:04:02] don't know who the last one is but when
[1:04:04] that last one comes in we go home amen
[1:04:08] right he said and so until the fullness
[1:04:10] of the Gentiles become in every name
[1:04:13] that's written on the book and so he
[1:04:15] said all Israel shall be saved as it is
[1:04:20] written there shall come out of s the
[1:04:21] deliverer it shall turn away ungodliness
[1:04:23] from Jacob oh my for this is my Covenant
[1:04:27] unto them when I take away their sins as
[1:04:29] concerning the gospel they're enemies
[1:04:32] for your sakes but as touching the
[1:04:34] election they are beloved for the
[1:04:37] father's sakes he says for the gifts and
[1:04:40] calling of God are without repentance
[1:04:44] they're still God's people and that's
[1:04:46] why you it's still a curse to be against
[1:04:49] Israel even though they don't believe
[1:04:51] anything right right they don't believe
[1:04:53] in the Messiah they've rejected their
[1:04:55] Messiah
[1:04:56] right but it's still a curse to be
[1:04:58] against Israel cuz they're still God's
[1:05:00] people right and that ought to make us
[1:05:02] think about how we treat one another
[1:05:04] because even if I even if I fail even if
[1:05:06] I even if you fail in some way we're
[1:05:08] still God's people we still have to
[1:05:10] treat one another right because there's
[1:05:11] still a blessing to bless God's people
[1:05:13] in a curse to go against them look at
[1:05:16] Abraham the story that we've been going
[1:05:17] through here Abraham lied and said she's
[1:05:20] my sister but when the king tried to
[1:05:21] take her he said you're as good as a
[1:05:23] dead man that's right why it's a
[1:05:25] blessing and a curse because you're
[1:05:28] still God's people amen oh that ought to
[1:05:32] that ought to
[1:05:33] really that ought to help us to
[1:05:35] understand how we should treat one
[1:05:37] another help me Lord now look he said
[1:05:41] even so he said uh he said for in times
[1:05:44] past you have not believed God yet have
[1:05:46] now obtained Mercy through their
[1:05:48] unbelief even so have these also now not
[1:05:50] believed that through your mercy they
[1:05:53] also May obtain Mercy
[1:05:56] even so he said for God ha concluded
[1:05:59] them all in unbelief that he might have
[1:06:01] mercy upon all and I love verse 33
[1:06:05] through the end of the chapter I've read
[1:06:06] it to you before but it means so much to
[1:06:08] me because Paul starts to worship and he
[1:06:11] said all the depth of the riches both of
[1:06:14] the wisdom and knowledge of God right he
[1:06:17] he gets after writing this under
[1:06:19] inspiration it just moves him and he
[1:06:21] said how unsearchable are his judgments
[1:06:23] his ways past finding out
[1:06:26] and he said for who ha known the mind of
[1:06:28] the Lord who have been his counselor who
[1:06:30] has first given to him and it should be
[1:06:32] recompensed unto him again for of him
[1:06:34] and through him and to him are all
[1:06:37] things someone say all things to whom be
[1:06:39] glory forever amen so he said God did
[1:06:41] this in his own mind we just found out
[1:06:44] what he did we could have never dreamed
[1:06:46] up a plan like that but God did
[1:06:50] it see Paul knew they'd be grafted back
[1:06:53] in now John sees the
[1:06:56] 144,000 but he doesn't see how exactly
[1:06:58] they would be brought back in because
[1:07:01] that was a mystery was held until the
[1:07:03] book was open so you see what the
[1:07:05] opening of the word tells us in our day
[1:07:08] it reveals to us the place of the
[1:07:11] Jews right at the end time because
[1:07:14] before that we could only speculate at
[1:07:16] it so brother brandom in the 1950s and
[1:07:19] to kind of prove this point we could
[1:07:21] only speculate that's all brother
[1:07:22] brandom could do before the book was
[1:07:25] open because in the 1950s brother Bram
[1:07:27] was on his way to Israel and he stopped
[1:07:29] anding Cairo had the ticket in his hand
[1:07:32] for Jerusalem or Tel Aviv and the Holy
[1:07:35] Spirit told him not to go and he didn't
[1:07:38] even understand it but the Holy Spirit
[1:07:39] rebuked him told him don't go he he
[1:07:42] didn't understand why and so brother
[1:07:46] brandham says it like this he said what
[1:07:48] a beautiful setup for the ministry the
[1:07:50] Lord has given me so brother Bram
[1:07:52] recognizes that Israel will believe a
[1:07:54] prophet and he knows the gift that God
[1:07:56] placed in his life the what he was if I
[1:07:59] could say it that way was a prophet
[1:08:02] right and so he realized that he said
[1:08:04] what a beautiful setup he said I was in
[1:08:06] 200 miles of Palestine recently and I
[1:08:09] had my ticket to go on over and I
[1:08:10] thought this is the hour I know that
[1:08:12] feeling cuz when you're flying into
[1:08:13] Egypt you can see into Palestine and you
[1:08:16] w so badly just hop on over you know I
[1:08:19] want to just cancel the the ticket and
[1:08:21] go over to to Israel but he said he told
[1:08:24] him he said don't go he was almost there
[1:08:27] he said don't go he said he called me
[1:08:29] from a plane went out behind the place
[1:08:30] and prayed and he said don't go now he
[1:08:32] said I'd love to see the day when we get
[1:08:34] in there and take all those thousands of
[1:08:35] Jews and say and now is it true that if
[1:08:38] he performs The Sign of the Prophet The
[1:08:40] Resurrection you will accept him go look
[1:08:42] out yourself out some men then and bring
[1:08:44] them in here let's see if he's the
[1:08:46] Messiah the same yesterday today and
[1:08:47] forever when the Lord would do as he's
[1:08:49] doing here he said I expect to see tens
[1:08:52] of thousands of Jews come to Christ at
[1:08:55] one time that was his
[1:08:56] expectation but God said don't go now
[1:08:59] and didn't explain to him why and it was
[1:09:02] after actually the seals were open and
[1:09:04] finally he's going to preach the seven
[1:09:06] trumpets remember and God said don't do
[1:09:08] that he told him to preach the Feast of
[1:09:10] the trumpets because he said all the
[1:09:13] trumpets sounded under the six seal and
[1:09:17] it was completely to the Jews it had
[1:09:18] nothing to do with us at all so after
[1:09:22] that he said this he in that sermon he
[1:09:24] said Brother Lou pet and them sent me
[1:09:26] those Bibles they give a million of them
[1:09:28] out to them Jews coming from Iran and
[1:09:30] everywhere coming back assembling
[1:09:32] themselves together become a nation I
[1:09:34] thought this is my time and he said
[1:09:37] don't do it now the hour is not yet he
[1:09:39] said then I returned home listen he said
[1:09:42] Moses and Elijah has got to call so it
[1:09:45] won't be brother brandom doing the sign
[1:09:46] of a prophet at all in Israel and
[1:09:50] brother Brandon couldn't separate that
[1:09:52] until after the opening of the word and
[1:09:55] so now he begins to see it he said he
[1:09:57] said see now the Feast of trumpets has
[1:09:59] to be known and this one over here in
[1:10:01] Malachi 4 is not connected with that one
[1:10:04] over there not at all not at all he said
[1:10:06] now watch here the ministry will be
[1:10:08] Moses and Elijah changing and calling
[1:10:11] Israel from the Jewish Traditions he
[1:10:14] said listen from the Jewish Traditions
[1:10:16] that they had been mixed up in being
[1:10:19] prophets they'll believe him calling
[1:10:21] them to the Feast of the atonement
[1:10:23] Christ letting them re recognize Christ
[1:10:27] they'll say he's coming he'll be here I
[1:10:30] notice what their Ministry is they'll be
[1:10:31] calling the Jews together the Jews will
[1:10:33] be gathering things like that and then
[1:10:36] when he comes say Here I Am see where'd
[1:10:39] you get them scars in the house of my
[1:10:42] friends he said the same as those two
[1:10:45] prophets did remember he said the
[1:10:46] Gentile bride us to have a prophet
[1:10:48] called Elijah is to call them out of
[1:10:50] their Traditions the bride he said just
[1:10:52] the same as these prophets called Jews
[1:10:54] out of Jew Judaism to Christ the
[1:10:56] atonement so there's three prophets at
[1:10:58] the end time one to the Gentiles and
[1:11:02] after he's gone and we're gone there
[1:11:04] will be two to the
[1:11:06] Jews and brother Bram goes on a little
[1:11:08] bit further down I don't have time to
[1:11:09] read all of it but he said the calling
[1:11:11] the seals which was to the Gentiles it
[1:11:15] had to be to the Gentiles to open up to
[1:11:17] the Gentile church he said that's all we
[1:11:21] know I love this everybody's trying to
[1:11:23] get into what well what's it going to be
[1:11:25] been how exactly is it going to happen
[1:11:26] to the Jews well we don't know because
[1:11:29] that's all we know is the seals right
[1:11:33] right because the trumpets were to the
[1:11:36] Jews right and all those things that
[1:11:38] happened during the tribulation period
[1:11:39] That's to those different groups but
[1:11:42] it's not to us he said he said that's
[1:11:45] all all we know is the seals that's all
[1:11:47] we know that's all we'll listen to
[1:11:49] what's already
[1:11:51] passed think about it church when the
[1:11:54] seals were opening it meant the church
[1:11:56] Ages were blending out right it doesn't
[1:11:59] just stop and start like what we think
[1:12:01] like today is the end of the church ages
[1:12:04] and tomorrow is the eternity right but
[1:12:06] it Blends together so at the opening of
[1:12:09] the felds in in
[1:12:12] 1963 the age begins to blend out right
[1:12:16] now we're still in the lean age how many
[1:12:18] you understand that around us we can see
[1:12:21] Leonia right we're still in that age but
[1:12:23] yet we're in a portion called the bride
[1:12:25] age that's the time that we live in it's
[1:12:28] the bride age we're living in that time
[1:12:31] that God has special favor on the bride
[1:12:33] that the fullness of the word has come
[1:12:35] back so we're we we're leaving this
[1:12:37] church age to go in Rapture we're on our
[1:12:41] way out the shouts already come oh
[1:12:44] church we just recognize where we're at
[1:12:46] there's already been a message come to
[1:12:48] call us out and he said all we all we
[1:12:51] know is what's already passed
[1:12:55] right so we're not looking that's why
[1:12:56] you can say I'm not looking for another
[1:12:59] Prophet I'm not looking for somebody to
[1:13:01] change
[1:13:02] anything I'm not looking for somebody to
[1:13:04] come along and have a a great Revival
[1:13:06] and call everybody and the whole
[1:13:07] nation's going to start serving the lord
[1:13:09] and that's not what we're looking for
[1:13:11] right that'd be wonderful but it's not
[1:13:13] going to happen right because all we'll
[1:13:16] listen to is what's already passed we
[1:13:18] look for Jesus that's our Focus that and
[1:13:23] listen church as long as we're right in
[1:13:25] our Doctrine I know we make mistakes and
[1:13:27] say things that are wrong but what we
[1:13:29] believe is that Jesus is coming make
[1:13:31] yourself ready if we can have one
[1:13:33] message that's what it is Jesus is
[1:13:36] coming make yourself ready because what
[1:13:38] we believe that's all we listen to
[1:13:40] what's already pass we look for Jesus I
[1:13:44] know I'm hammering down on that but it's
[1:13:46] important he said you say now wait a
[1:13:48] minute brother Brandon I believe they're
[1:13:49] going to do this he said the last sign
[1:13:53] that Abraham and we are the Royal Seed
[1:13:55] of Abraham the bride the last sign that
[1:13:58] Abraham ever seen before the promised
[1:14:00] son come was what God in a form of a
[1:14:04] human being that could discern the
[1:14:06] thoughts of the people one
[1:14:09] man not a dozen one man no matter how
[1:14:13] many
[1:14:14] impersonations he said they had one and
[1:14:17] he discerned the thoughts was in there
[1:14:19] what and the next thing
[1:14:21] happened oh where we at church but Jesus
[1:14:25] predicted there' be a delay remember
[1:14:27] there'd be a delay and during the delay
[1:14:29] the the servant would begin to Smite his
[1:14:31] fellow servants but he said Watch and
[1:14:33] Pray that's the hour that we're living
[1:14:35] in during that time of delay but the
[1:14:38] next thing is the coming of the Lord
[1:14:41] we're we're we're laying in the presence
[1:14:43] of the sun getting right you say
[1:14:44] nothing's happening well it's like a
[1:14:46] wheat field at the very end of harvest
[1:14:48] you don't see any discernable growth
[1:14:50] because the growth's on the inside not
[1:14:53] on the outside sure we we we still shout
[1:14:56] we still speak in tongues we still have
[1:14:58] gifts we still believe in those things
[1:15:00] but that's not the focus of this age the
[1:15:02] focus of this age is to make David White
[1:15:05] ready are you with me now ready for a
[1:15:08] Rapture oh that's a hard job isn't it
[1:15:11] but the word is going to do it because
[1:15:13] he's called from the foundation of the
[1:15:15] Earth the focus of this church and every
[1:15:17] message church is not to have a great
[1:15:19] big meeting although we love big
[1:15:21] meetings but that's not what that's not
[1:15:23] our focus our focus is to make each and
[1:15:25] every one of you ready to make me ready
[1:15:28] that's a big job to get me ready what's
[1:15:31] this message going to do that's why I
[1:15:33] preach the message that's why I get into
[1:15:35] the message of the hour because that's
[1:15:36] what's going to make us
[1:15:39] ready we want to be ready to go it's
[1:15:42] been on my heart lately have that body
[1:15:43] change it's coming and we know it could
[1:15:46] be any moment just in a moment in the
[1:15:47] twinkling of an eye let me be ready
[1:15:50] Lord and no matter how long we're here
[1:15:52] that's going to be the focus because
[1:15:54] every everything we can see is already
[1:15:56] passed except for the coming of the
[1:16:01] Lord he said the next thing happened was
[1:16:03] Abraham and Sarah turned back to a young
[1:16:05] man and woman listen we live in that
[1:16:08] third day look how close we are Hosea
[1:16:11] 62 after two days will he revive us
[1:16:15] speaking of the nation of Israel and the
[1:16:17] third day he will raise us up and we
[1:16:20] shall live in his sight where we at
[1:16:22] church we're living in that time amen
[1:16:25] we're living in that time now brother BR
[1:16:29] said as soon as this church the bride is
[1:16:31] drawned together she is taken up and
[1:16:34] remember we're not drawn together in one
[1:16:36] physical place on the Earth where are we
[1:16:39] Drawn Together in Christ in the word
[1:16:42] she's taken up and that mystery of the
[1:16:45] seventh seal or the seventh seal the
[1:16:47] mystery of going I love the way he puts
[1:16:49] that and the Jews is called by The
[1:16:52] Mystery of the seventh trumpet which is
[1:16:54] two prophets Elijah and Moses and they
[1:16:56] come back see people looking for brother
[1:16:58] brandom to come back he's not coming
[1:16:59] back Elijah and Moses are coming back to
[1:17:03] the Jews but the brandom don't have to
[1:17:05] come back why the seals are open that
[1:17:08] was our
[1:17:09] part are you with
[1:17:11] me and there is where the Pentecostals
[1:17:14] he said is all mixed up they're looking
[1:17:17] for something to happen the church is
[1:17:19] done gone and that's to the
[1:17:22] Jews so they asked for the brand
[1:17:25] will we see Miracles now brother brandom
[1:17:27] I think knew what they were talking
[1:17:28] about because the Pentecostals were
[1:17:31] always looking for some kind of miracle
[1:17:32] that would just bring a worldwide
[1:17:34] Revival we believe in miracles how many
[1:17:37] believe in miracles I'm a miracle you're
[1:17:39] a miracle we've seen Miracles we've seen
[1:17:41] God do things we believe we'll continue
[1:17:43] to see that till the coming of the Lord
[1:17:45] in fact I believe in many ways it'll
[1:17:47] increase as our faith increases as we
[1:17:49] become the word right it has to because
[1:17:52] we get closer and closer to him before
[1:17:54] we go go home we believe in miracles but
[1:17:57] brother random told us he said I believe
[1:17:59] we're seeing you're seeing the last
[1:18:01] thing that will happen to the church
[1:18:03] before the Rapture so the last public
[1:18:06] sign of his coming yes sir was the same
[1:18:10] one that Abraham got when he stood there
[1:18:13] and discerned the secrets of the heart
[1:18:14] you see why Satan would like to
[1:18:15] impersonate
[1:18:17] that because if he can impersonate that
[1:18:19] and get your focus off of the message
[1:18:21] the voice behind that particular sign
[1:18:24] the B said there would be many
[1:18:26] impersonations there was only one there
[1:18:28] was only one that God Called to do that
[1:18:30] to show that sign he said he said the
[1:18:34] rain is over he said just read he said
[1:18:37] well what about our latter rain well we
[1:18:41] it's the message of the hour it's the
[1:18:43] coming of the Lord yeah there's going to
[1:18:46] be a great
[1:18:48] Revival right a great Revival our bodies
[1:18:50] are changing amen right until then don't
[1:18:53] grow weary come on huh don't get dead
[1:18:56] don't get cold don't get complacent this
[1:18:58] isn't the hour to get complacent this
[1:19:00] isn't the hour to quit church it's the
[1:19:02] hour to be
[1:19:04] ready but we're not looking for if if
[1:19:07] you're waiting on somebody to do
[1:19:08] something to put you in Revival
[1:19:11] somebody's already done something to put
[1:19:13] you in Revival Jesus isn't going to come
[1:19:15] back and show us his nail scarred hands
[1:19:17] we're going home we're going to meet
[1:19:19] with him in the air we're being caught
[1:19:20] up together to meet him listen
[1:19:22] everything that we have need of we
[1:19:23] already have just look at it church it's
[1:19:26] already here listen we're not waiting on
[1:19:29] Joseph to reveal himself to us we're his
[1:19:31] wife we belong to him we've been married
[1:19:34] to Christ the
[1:19:36] word right but the Jews are
[1:19:39] waiting on something to happen and
[1:19:41] something big is going to happen to the
[1:19:43] nation of
[1:19:45] Israel brother brandom says that's
[1:19:47] what's promised the church he said he
[1:19:49] said the reain is over just read the
[1:19:51] first three chapters of Revelation
[1:19:52] you'll see what's promised to the church
[1:19:54] he said that's what's promised church
[1:19:56] right there the church ages he said you
[1:19:58] notice the other day when we started
[1:19:59] them Trumpets the holy spirit said that
[1:20:00] don't belong here and they'd ask about
[1:20:03] the latter rain so he said now latter
[1:20:04] rain 144,000 Jews know that he said that
[1:20:07] won't they that's when Elijah and Moses
[1:20:09] that's where the Miracles take place he
[1:20:11] said the things that the people's been
[1:20:13] looking for the Pentecost is for
[1:20:14] miracles he said that's where that'll
[1:20:16] take place in that under them he said
[1:20:18] that's Elijah and Moses they Smite the
[1:20:20] Earth with curses as off they will they
[1:20:22] close the heavens that it don't rain on
[1:20:23] the days of their prophecy
[1:20:25] and God will stand and fight for them
[1:20:27] like he did and he'll bring them out
[1:20:29] under a mighty hand just exactly like he
[1:20:31] did in Egypt out of these isms of the
[1:20:33] world and he'll do that but see when we
[1:20:37] get news coverage what do we get it for
[1:20:41] oh come on church we get news coverage
[1:20:42] in the message usually it's because
[1:20:44] somebody did something
[1:20:46] bad cuz there's rotten
[1:20:49] apples right that's just the truth we
[1:20:53] get news coverage most of the time in
[1:20:54] for that and and it wasn't any different
[1:20:57] in brother bram's time brother brandham
[1:20:58] said it's because he said they expose us
[1:21:00] because the others are too big to expose
[1:21:03] so the devil's always looking to expose
[1:21:05] something going on and guess what if
[1:21:07] you're looking for problems you can find
[1:21:09] them because we're just as human as any
[1:21:11] other group of people's ever been
[1:21:13] because these bodies haven't been
[1:21:15] changed yet but they're going to be
[1:21:17] changed one day not because of how
[1:21:19] righteous we are be but because of the
[1:21:22] the atonement that's in our midst the
[1:21:24] word atonement see that's why Israel why
[1:21:26] balum couldn't curse Israel it wasn't
[1:21:28] because listen to me church this is
[1:21:30] where we get off so many times we feel
[1:21:32] like our blessing comes from well I live
[1:21:34] in in such a good way I'm so good to
[1:21:36] people and I treat people so right that
[1:21:39] and I do everything just right and all
[1:21:40] my life I've done things in a right way
[1:21:42] and because of that that's where my
[1:21:44] blessing is not where your blessing
[1:21:45] comes from your blessing comes because
[1:21:48] there's an
[1:21:50] atonement right in the
[1:21:52] camp it doesn't come from being perfect
[1:21:55] it comes because there's an atonement
[1:21:58] and whenever you try to work your way
[1:21:59] into it you know what will happen you'll
[1:22:00] begin to separate yourself from
[1:22:02] fellowship separate yourself from people
[1:22:03] because you realize they're imperfect
[1:22:06] but after a while you realize you're
[1:22:07] imperfect too and pretty soon we're
[1:22:10] everybody's sitting off by themselves
[1:22:13] and all of us have known people like
[1:22:14] that they couldn't fellowship with
[1:22:15] nobody couldn't go to church nowhere why
[1:22:17] because they they they they think well I
[1:22:19] got to get ready for Rapture I got to be
[1:22:21] and and I got to be right in myself we
[1:22:22] want to be right but we're not right we
[1:22:24] don't we're not blessed because we're
[1:22:26] right we're blessed because of an
[1:22:27] atonement that we have the fullness of
[1:22:29] the word in our
[1:22:31] midst see bam failed to see a brass
[1:22:34] serpent he failed to see a smitten Rock
[1:22:36] but we can see it today with the the the
[1:22:39] mercy seats in plain
[1:22:41] view but one day the the papers and the
[1:22:44] oh not really papers today it's
[1:22:47] digital but one day they'll they'll view
[1:22:49] the B's life would have been impossible
[1:22:52] even in brother brandom's time
[1:22:55] for that to happen but the Bible says
[1:22:58] they'll the whole world will rejoice
[1:23:01] when the two prophets die in the same
[1:23:03] day that they die how will that happen I
[1:23:05] don't know if they'll live stream it or
[1:23:07] be on cable TV or how that'll happen but
[1:23:10] somehow everybody's going to see it and
[1:23:11] we have the technology today to do
[1:23:14] it they'll watch them die and be
[1:23:20] resurrected but that's not our Miracle
[1:23:24] our Miracle is to be
[1:23:26] changed and a moment in the twinkling of
[1:23:28] an eye and go
[1:23:29] home brother Brandon said we're just to
[1:23:32] wait on the coming of the Lord just wait
[1:23:36] oh that's tough isn't
[1:23:38] it is that hard somebody gets fidgety
[1:23:42] when you have to
[1:23:44] wait isn't it hard to wait some of you
[1:23:46] husbands know how hard it is to wait I
[1:23:49] my patience has been perfected
[1:23:55] my wife is is uh bless her heart she and
[1:23:58] and Peter takes after her so whoever
[1:24:01] marries Peter's in for
[1:24:04] it but uh they do everything slow and I
[1:24:07] do everything fast and I'm always too
[1:24:09] early nervous wound up anxious and and
[1:24:15] my wife does everything too slow but
[1:24:16] she's never never blate she's most of
[1:24:19] the time she's not late she's just on
[1:24:21] time and to me that's too slow right I I
[1:24:25] I've showed up for 5 years I've showed
[1:24:26] up 2 hours early for church it just just
[1:24:29] the way it is even if I've got nothing
[1:24:31] to do I show up just in case something
[1:24:33] might need to be done show up two hours
[1:24:36] early for church so we're but but
[1:24:38] waiting is
[1:24:39] hard believe me it's hard but he said
[1:24:42] just wait that's the hour we live in and
[1:24:44] while you wait keep your lamps trimmed
[1:24:47] all fil waiting doesn't mean but he said
[1:24:49] occupy till I come keep preaching keep
[1:24:51] singing keep raising your children keep
[1:24:53] planting your potatoes keep working at
[1:24:55] your job keep doing what's right but you
[1:24:58] got to wait keep your lamps trimmed all
[1:25:01] filled full of oil pray up watch what he
[1:25:04] says every
[1:25:06] hour every hour not every day every hour
[1:25:11] just keep ready be ready be
[1:25:13] sweet and
[1:25:15] watching oh that ought to that ought to
[1:25:18] Thrill all our hearts tonight just wait
[1:25:20] be ready be sweet and
[1:25:23] watching see it's the two prophets
[1:25:25] that's Revelation 11:6 where it tells us
[1:25:27] they have power to shut Heavens r on in
[1:25:29] the days of their prophets have power
[1:25:30] over Waters to turn them to blood to
[1:25:32] Smite the Earth with plagues as often as
[1:25:34] they will that's your Miracles 144,000
[1:25:38] elect Jews will be there and they'll
[1:25:40] believe their word but where is the
[1:25:43] Gentile bride during that time go to
[1:25:44] Genesis
[1:25:47] 42:5 it says the sons of Israel came to
[1:25:49] buy corn among those that came for the
[1:25:52] famine was in the land of Canaan and
[1:25:54] Joseph was the governor over the land
[1:25:57] and he it was that sold to all the
[1:25:58] people of the land and Joseph's Brethren
[1:26:00] came and bowed down themselves before
[1:26:02] him with their faces to the Earth and
[1:26:05] Joseph saw his Brethren and he knew them
[1:26:08] but made himself strange unto them and
[1:26:11] spake roughly unto them and he said unto
[1:26:14] them whence Come Ye and they said from
[1:26:16] the land of Canaan to buy food and
[1:26:19] Joseph knew his Brethren but they knew
[1:26:20] him not knew not him now something had
[1:26:23] happened now watch he didn't yet know
[1:26:26] about Benjamin they were fixing to tell
[1:26:28] him about Benjamin but what's happening
[1:26:31] he dealing roughly with them because
[1:26:34] there's got to come a time that Benjamin
[1:26:36] comes before him and he reveals himself
[1:26:39] to him so there's a whole sagga like
[1:26:41] almost like a game that's being played
[1:26:43] we don't have time to go all into it
[1:26:44] tonight but Joseph begins to play all
[1:26:47] this game with them what for what
[1:26:49] purpose to see their attitude towards
[1:26:53] Benjamin right and it's during that time
[1:26:54] they begin to repent and all of those
[1:26:56] things so we know in the type the 10 are
[1:27:00] actually the 10 sons are actually under
[1:27:03] the altar right crying how long but
[1:27:07] they're given white robes what is it God
[1:27:09] made a way for the elect Jew that died
[1:27:12] during the hoola and during all of those
[1:27:13] times of persecution and they're under
[1:27:16] the Altar and that's the fifth seal
[1:27:19] right but now he there's going to be
[1:27:22] 144,000 at the end that's Benjamin who
[1:27:24] was born in the land born in Joseph's
[1:27:28] absence so Joseph accuses them of being
[1:27:31] spies and they said thy servants are 12
[1:27:33] Brethren and the sons of one man in the
[1:27:36] land of Canaan behold the youngest is
[1:27:38] this day with our father and one is
[1:27:43] not now think about it Joseph that's
[1:27:46] where he learns about
[1:27:48] Benjamin eventually Benjamin comes
[1:27:50] before him in Genesis
[1:27:52] 43:29 it says he lift up his eyes and
[1:27:55] saw his brother Benjamin his mother's
[1:27:59] son and said brother BR said his mother
[1:28:02] was that Orthodox
[1:28:03] church right the the the Orthodox Jewish
[1:28:06] church will produce a Benjamin right who
[1:28:09] had nothing to do right was born in the
[1:28:12] land had nothing to do with the with the
[1:28:14] crucifixion of Christ nothing to do with
[1:28:17] throwing him in the pit but now what
[1:28:19] what what are they doing yet he's going
[1:28:21] to have mercy to them though that he
[1:28:22] could look at them in judgment but he's
[1:28:24] going to have mercy he's going to love
[1:28:25] them he said he looked he lifted up his
[1:28:28] eyes on his Benjamin he said is this
[1:28:30] your younger brother of whom you spake
[1:28:32] unto me and he said God be gracious unto
[1:28:34] thee my son and Joseph made haste for
[1:28:38] his bowels did yearn as his heart his
[1:28:41] insides yearn upon his brother he had to
[1:28:44] run out of the chamber he was so
[1:28:46] overcome with emotion he sought where to
[1:28:50] weep and he entered into his chamber and
[1:28:53] wept there you think God don't have a
[1:28:54] heart for his people he does am he does
[1:28:59] you can see how much he loved
[1:29:01] him and and the the brothers begin to
[1:29:04] realize what they had done and they
[1:29:05] begin to say oh you know we we're get in
[1:29:07] this trouble because of Joseph it's
[1:29:09] because of what we did to Joseph not
[1:29:10] even knowing that it was Joseph that was
[1:29:12] standing there and brother Brown said he
[1:29:15] spoke to him it's great the detail
[1:29:17] brother Brown goes into with this he
[1:29:18] said he spoke to him through an
[1:29:19] interpreter in an unknown tongue right
[1:29:23] but he said he understands unknown
[1:29:25] tongues he spoke to them and through an
[1:29:28] interpreter and they be to realize what
[1:29:30] they had done but before he could reveal
[1:29:33] himself to them he had to end his
[1:29:36] dealings with the Gentiles so what does
[1:29:39] he do genesis
[1:29:40] 451 then Joseph could not refrain
[1:29:43] himself before all them that stood by
[1:29:46] him and he cried cause every man to go
[1:29:50] out from me and there stood no man with
[1:29:52] him while Joseph made himself known unto
[1:29:56] his Brethren brother BR said now where
[1:29:59] will the Gentile Church be while Jesus
[1:30:02] is making himself known to his Brethren
[1:30:05] remember that the Bride of Joseph with
[1:30:07] the two children were in the palace for
[1:30:10] Joseph had commanded let everyone leave
[1:30:13] me put them all out from before me so
[1:30:16] the Gentile bride was hidden in the
[1:30:19] Palace of Joseph all right that's why
[1:30:22] we're caught away in a secret
[1:30:25] amen a secret catching away sudden
[1:30:28] secret going away of the church we're
[1:30:30] hidden in the palace for our honeymoon
[1:30:34] right Joseph had commanded let everyone
[1:30:36] leave me put them all out before me the
[1:30:38] Gentile bride was hidden in the Palace
[1:30:39] of Joseph where will the Gentile Church
[1:30:42] go in the Rapture into the palace the
[1:30:45] bride will be taken off the Earth she
[1:30:47] will be caught up before the Great
[1:30:49] Tribulation to meet her Lord in the air
[1:30:53] for three and a half years while the r
[1:30:55] retributive wrath of God is poured out
[1:30:58] she will be in the great Mary supper of
[1:31:01] the Lamb then will he
[1:31:05] return now I love this because I'm I'm
[1:31:08] picturing in my mind because the way
[1:31:10] brother Brandon puts it in the seals he
[1:31:11] said he slips
[1:31:13] off right we're at the wedding supper
[1:31:15] and we're all rejoicing and wipes the
[1:31:17] tears from our eyes but he's got
[1:31:19] something to
[1:31:20] do brother BR said he slips away from
[1:31:24] the marriage supper to go down and meet
[1:31:26] Benjamin and reveal himself to Benjamin
[1:31:31] he said he will return leaving his bride
[1:31:33] in his father's house while he makes
[1:31:35] himself known to his Brethren he slips
[1:31:38] off from his honeymoon he said I got
[1:31:41] something I've got to do and he goes
[1:31:43] down to reveal himself for the day of
[1:31:47] atonement you talk about a
[1:31:49] Revival because they'll be they'll be
[1:31:52] have been having been Tau by the two
[1:31:54] prophets for three and a half years
[1:31:56] they'll be ready they'll be ready to
[1:31:58] receive him they'll be gathered together
[1:32:00] and they've seen the mighty works that
[1:32:01] God's done they'll be ready and he'll
[1:32:04] walk down there with nail scars right
[1:32:07] and again I don't know exactly but I
[1:32:09] like to than you just is literally going
[1:32:10] to go down with nail scars and just walk
[1:32:13] among them and they're going to look at
[1:32:15] him and said where did you get those
[1:32:17] scars but the B said they'll know that
[1:32:19] he was their Messiah but they don't know
[1:32:21] how he got the scars cuz they don't know
[1:32:24] nothing about church history they don't
[1:32:25] know hardly anything they've only been
[1:32:27] taught Jewish
[1:32:28] Orthodoxy right that Jesus was just a
[1:32:31] prophet and they said we know you're the
[1:32:32] Messiah where did you get the scars
[1:32:35] he'll say in the house of my friends and
[1:32:37] there will be a weeping Zachariah tells
[1:32:39] us a weeping and a wailing and a day of
[1:32:41] atonement but we're not waiting on our
[1:32:44] day of atonement don't you see it Church
[1:32:46] our day of atonement was on Mount calary
[1:32:48] amen that's the day he made an atonement
[1:32:50] for my sin he's coming back for a day of
[1:32:53] atonement for them to show them what he
[1:32:57] did but our faith in his atonement is on
[1:33:00] in in what's already done not in what's
[1:33:03] going to come but what's already done so
[1:33:05] right now we're as good as raptured
[1:33:07] right now we're as good as oh come on
[1:33:08] church right now we're in the best place
[1:33:10] we could possibly be in why because
[1:33:13] we've accepted that atonement we've he's
[1:33:15] already been revealed to us in the
[1:33:17] fullness of the word we're ready to meet
[1:33:19] him amen oh aren't you glad for that
[1:33:22] today it's time to go home church it's

[1:33:36] perfect type of Christ musicians go
