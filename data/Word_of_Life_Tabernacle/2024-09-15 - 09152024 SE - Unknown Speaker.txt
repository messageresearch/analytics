says now Faith is a substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand the worlds was framed by the word of God set things which are seen were not made of things which do appear by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than of Cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts by it he's being dead yet speaketh by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death was not found because God has translated him for before the his translation he has a testimony that he pleased his God but with without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that disly seek seeks him by faith Noah being warned of God of things not seen as yet moved with fear prepared an AR to the saving of his house by which condemned the world and became an heir of all the righteous which he is by Faith by faith Abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should have to receive for inheritance obeyed and he went out knowing whether he went by faith he sojourned in a Land Of Promise in a strange country dwelling in Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob The Heirs with him of the same promise for he looked for a city which has foundations whose Builder and maker was God can we bow our hearts one more time this evening Lord Jesus thank you Lord for your presence thus far Lord Lord we thank you Lord for your presence this morning Lord God we pray this evening Lord that you'll

few moments tonight and we was ministering this morning and we ended there ministering on the uh contents of his will and we got to a place where we was dealing with the notification of after the death of the testator and how the executive would come and and be able to to break the seal and begin to read the contents of the wheel and we we was we was sharing with you how this message it was a notification it was a it was a summons it was a shout that was going forth and notify and let us know of the father's possession and it belongs to me amen how many could put their name right there this this evening it belongs to you and and and we thank God and and what good would it be to have a messenger of this Asia come if there wasn't somebody here this evening to be reciprocate of that message and we want to thank God this evening for such a message such a time as this and and we was we was looking at how that you know that that the little Eagle in the Barnard how that he was notified by the the scream of uh uh uh of a mama eagle flying over the Barnard and he and that eagle knew that he had a an an an egg somewhere he had a another eaglet somewhere amen and it begin to comb through the Barnard but not every bird recognized the scream not every bird recognized the shout but there was a there was one bird down there that recognized the and there was a deep calling to the deep and he be to respond when everybody else was running away for the message when everybody else was shunning the message there was something about you here amen at Word Life Tabernacle amen you you can't you can't help what your your family says you don't you can't help what your job says you can't help what the world or the internet's saying but down inside of your soul there's a burning sensation that God placed there and the trials of Life only makes it burn that much greater amen when the Winds of Hell begins to blow it only makes your fire burn that much greater it's in possible that hell can put out the fire that God l l in The Bride of Jesus Christ amen we're here to let it shine tonight aren't you and we realize tonight as we said this morning amen that that that that thank God he examines the lamb amen thank God he looks through through down through the The Eyes Of God down in to you pass your flesh pass your mistakes past your failures and he sees a lamb he sees the bloody lamb amen and death can't penetrate the lamb death cannot cannot strike where the provided place of God is and that is in the lamb Hallelujah that night in Egypt when the death angel was coming down amen it was invited to every home every home it was invited besides those that had lamb Fellowship amen they applied the blood according to the word of God Amen implied it on the little the door L of the home church it was something about that amen that brought a peace to that home we would like to take for a few moments tonight and Minister on this one thing I know amen and and that's one thing they didn't know amen when there was screams in a house down the road and the this little boy's friends was dying am and the death danger had Liberty to go into their homes but the father of this home had the token applied over their home amen it brought such a a no so attitude and to a place that brother B could say like like this amen the little boy would come to his daddy says Daddy they just took my best friend and his daddy's response to him says son I applied the blood according to the word of a king and where the word of the king is there's power son go ahead go to your bedroom go ahead play with your toys amen you're you're safe behind the blood of the innocent lamb Hallelujah you believe that and brother Brown would say like this see you've got to know and you cannot know until you have faith and Faith produces the no so he says faith is that no no so faith it produces Faith produces the know so it creates or CS to happen it lets you know and nothing can change your mind are you thankful for that listen no matter what you're going through job went through a lot of things job's life was wrecked everything was falling apart he was losing his family losing his kids he's losing his cattle his body was felling him to a place that brother BR would say like this amen even his wife was kind of gigging him why don't you curse God and die but there was a there was an Integrity in job's heart when everything was going wrong around him he still had something within him when he was down to maybe his last string of Hope brother would say maybe looked through the window and he begin to see the wind blowing and the trees are waving and the grass are growing and the trees may be buding and he screamed out in his despair I know I know my redeemer liveth Hallelujah though the skin rooms destroys this body yet in my flesh I should SE God God he believed it and to believe it is a substance that creates a perfect faith and perfect Faith Masters every circumstance Hallelujah faith is the victory that overcomes Every curse of the devil brother R would say faith finds this source that no one can explain it it's something that you know others can't see it the worlds can't see it the other the other birds around you can't see it but you've been notified and you can see it but Faith sees it Faith sees with a natural eye doesn't see it but the inside eye sees that thing Faith sees what God wants done oh I hope this goes in he says faith doesn't look at the present time Faith doesn't see this here Faith looks to see what God wants and it works accordingly he said when you catch that faith that you're going to be healed every circumstance everything signs all symptoms can point that you're dying it'll never brother steart it'll never move you it's a resting place in the sanctuary of God word sister Jamie and he said brother Mike he said hopes on the outside hoping it was in faith is already on the inside looking out declaring the no so it's already done the Battle Is Over the victory has been won faith is already on the end looking out saying it's done there is where Faith takes its resting place for it knows it knows that God will never let the enemy ride over top of them Faith sees what the blind people do don't see the flesh may say no no can you feel it can you feel it and your flesh may be responding because your your flesh is beaten down your flesh is taken a beaten maybe from from sickness or depression your spirit's all torn and your flesh might say Can you feel it you say no can you hear it you can the flesh could say no can you smell it the flesh could say no he says but can you believe it and something down in your soul regardless of how the flesh feels it screams out I know my redeemer liveth Hallelujah do you believe it and the bride says why cuz God's promises are always yes and amen can I be healed brother Robert yes and amen can I be delivered tonight yes and amen can I have the victory tonight yes and amen every promise in the book belongs to a believer it's the contents of his will and if your name's attached to the promise it's yes and amen every promise is yours God's

you see you understand and when you understand you know why do I know because I came I seen I understand so I know just as Peter would scream out Thou Art the Christ the son of a living God and Upon This Rock I'll build my my church and the gates of hell can never Prevail against it it'll try it'll try to beat you down but it can never render successfully why because you're not working on a maybe Soul you're working by something that you see and you understand and you know Hallelujah by that joob knew I know my redeemer liveth it's not a mystery any longer we're not living in a mystery any

beloved bride to realize a this is a season this time is not your place amen it's just a season you J just passing through you came to this world you was trapped in the barnyard because of what happened in the Garden of Eden but you heard the notification and the shout proclaimed you with summons amen you couldn't help yourself brother Brown said it goes against my nature he said but it was the forn knowledge of God taking place I can't explain it you can't explain it but it was the Deep calling to the deep and when you responded to that call the it was no longer a mystery Church we're not wondering if we're bride we're not wondering tonight if we're going to make it I believe this message notified us to let us know he slipped that ring upon your finger that unmar grace before the found foundation of the world Hallelujah and he come to let you know in time what took place in the eternities before there was a world and now it's not a mystery we know Hallelujah second Timothy 1:12 says for this which cause I also suffer these things nevertheless I'm I'm not ashamed for I know whom I have believed and I'm persuaded that he is able to keep how many he's persuaded tonight I'm

God he's never late he's always on time it may look like he's 4 days L brother steart but he's an on time God he knew exactly what you have need of tonight he knew exactly who would be ministering tonight he knew exactly what to say to you tonight and he's here to declare to you and notify you amen and let you know let you know everything's going to be all right Hallelujah you say brother Joe you don't know my circumstances I don't but God does I say he's he I know one thing he's not in Checkmate our God is not in Checkmate it may look like he's in Checkmate in your circumstance but let me declare to you tonight there is no way there is not a chance that Satan can every every put God in Checkmate oh that should make a make a Baptist want to shout tonight amen no matter what's going on in your life Satan does and never will have the upper hand Hallelujah no matter what the king will still have one more move St John tells us about a man that was blind from birth he was blind but it came a time and and they came and question him he says why is this man blind is it because his mom or dad his parents do this and CA him no it's but the works of God should be made manifest unto him and we know the story how that Jesus came and sped upon the ground and he picked up a little Spin and a little clay and he be to mix it together together it might have looked like fanatic fanaticism to the world but it be to place it upon this young man's eyes he may have rubbed him in really good upon his eyes and he told this young man to go down to the pool and wash could you imagine as that guy that that young person went down to the pool that day and no doubt this flesh was tell she Jenny you've been blind there's not a chance the doctor says there's no hope the world says there's no chance but at his word he went down to the pool could you imagine he got down there and he dipped his face down into the pool and he begin to take the wash the mud off his face and all of a sudden he could see a little blurry of light he can see a little sliver of light as it begins to wash it away how manyan he's been there before amen and that he begins to wash it away and the mud's running off his cheeks and the world is making fun of him brother M he begin to worh it away and all of a sudden it began clear and clear and for the first time in his whole entire life his eyes came open and he was able to see and the world made fun of him the world couldn't stand it it tormented hell to the place they begin to question his parents his parents David said well go he's of age go go visit with him ask him get his own response and they came to this young man and they begin to talk to him and he no doubt told him said you know what I don't know what you're saying's true or not but there's one thing I know I once was blind but now I see regardless of what's going on around him him that's one thing it was no longer a mystery he was living it Hallelujah and we can say the same thing this evening amen I once was lost but now I failed it's not a mystery any longer it's not a mystery we're living it this world is not my home the Barnard is not our home Hallelujah regardless of all the mocker and regardless of how much the darkness of hell was overshadow the age of Lady OA that were trapped into the churches how did it happen I can't explain it you can't explain it all I know I went down to the pool blind but at God's word I put my faith in God's word can somebody do that tonight I'm going to put my faith in God's infallible word and I'm here to tell you it's not a 99% chance you put your faith in God's word and that will come to pass Hallelujah all I know I once was blind but now I see all I know I was once a sinner trapped in humanity with no hope with no chance but Grace came looking for me I didn't go look for him he came looking for me Hallelujah I was unworthy I was a sinner I was trapped in humanity but Grace overshadowed my life and it's not a mystery any longer

go to work you want a good good battery in your car you want to have faith when you go out there and turn it over it's not going it's going to fire right off it's going to be able to get you to your destination how many likes that Assurance I got think about as a deer hunter maybe maybe there's certain times that you're hunting by yourself somewhere and you're not too familiar brother Mike with your surroundings and maybe a big buck walks by and you get a good shot and you give it some time and you get down out of your tree stand you go searching for your era and trying to find brother Allen that first drop of blood and my you find a drop of blood and maybe I walk back to get my four-wheeler and drive back up to that spot and and in my mind I'm thinking I'm fixing going on a goose hun and fall in a blood trail and and then I would lay maybe my headlamp on my four-wheeler and it become my Assurance know matter how deep I get in the woods if I can find a place to look back to that light I can find my way back thank God there's a Lighthouse church thank God there's a light that's shining this hour no matter how far you get I'm here to tell you I know one thing for sure my God can't lose a one of you you've been engraved into the palms of his hands and he's got a light in the evening time and no matter where you're at you can look back as Jonah was in the belly of a whale down in a deep ocean Oh my he might not be able to see that light brother stir with his natural eyes but brother Brown said he he didn't know how he kept him alive down there but it came to a point he turned he no if I could look TOS the Holy Temple my God's going to hear my prayer I know my God can hear me in the bottom of the ocean and a Well's belly he said you think you got circumstances look at Jonah he was buried in the buried in the bottom of the ocean in the belly of a whale in such Darkness but right in the midst of Darkness he did have a light he couldn't see it with his flesh eyes but get see it with a supernatural eyes and he had an understanding he knowed if he could turn to God to the Holy Temple God's going to hear his prayer don't you believe that and church I've been hundreds and hundreds of yards away from my four-wheeler and I can turn turn and I might positionist myself and walk around a few trees all I'll catch that flicker of light oh it brings Assurance to know I know my way back no doubt that's the way brother Brown said he felt when he was trapped on Hurricane Mountain and the wind was and the the snow was blowing the wind was blowing it was a blizzard he said but I just held my hand up knowing knowing amen if I could ever grab a hold of that Lifeline Hallelujah you remember brother B said he cut a hole out for brother bandam to walk all the way to the top he said I just kept my hand up I knew if I could touch that Lifeline it will take me to everything that dear on Earth to me thank God we got a Lifeline here today amen and we're and we're not waiting on

the enemy would come in with their Force God would combat it he will bring a force to supersede it in the hour that we're living in he anointed us with the wings of eagles amen as a flying eagle amen and we know as a Believer we know how to spread our wings the message of the hour is taught us how to let go and if we let go the wind of Yahweh to come down and be the wind beneath our wings and echo in your heart oh how far you run it's begins to Echo in your heart begins to notify you it's dark it's so dark down here thank god brother Brown said there's a little boy down in that cave [Laughter] says sister don't worry I know the man that can turn on the light and he is present and this message has came to declare to us he is here the message declared to drive back fear I know a man he's here and he can turn on the lights brother Brown said how Hallelujah that's what the little church is going to do don't worry there's a man here today that can turn on the lights he said that's the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah there's one thing I know thousand may fall at this side 10,000 may fall at this side but I know one thing it cannot come nigh unto you why the lamb is in the way that dead Calvary death didn't trap Jesus Jesus trapped death he conquered it once and for all Hallelujah do you love him brother Brown was talking about shamgar he said shangar said I'm sick and tired of it how many he's ever been there before I'm not worri I said I'm not a warrior the odds are against me no matter how much odds are against you I like this he says God is for you God is for you if you take his word he said there's one thing I know I'm circumcised I'm an Israelite he is an uncircumcised Philistine I know that I'm right and that no so gave him the strength or the authority and say I'm a Child of God I know I'm outnumbered I know he's got he's bigger than I am they got better artillery than I've got he said I know diseases come from the devil I know God's promised me Victory he says Whoa brother I wish you felt like I did right now he's not a warrior but he was an isra Li he was circumcised and tonight you are circumcised with the Holy Ghost you don't have to wait till you're trained to be a warrior God bless your heart claim your god-given privileges and beat their heads in Oh Glory get out of the way Satan kick him out of the way I'm the guy that's taken over now I come in Jesus name amen there's power in his name name every knee shall bow at the name of Jesus Christ depression will have to bow sickness will have to bow oppression will have to bow kick him out of the way watch him scatter brother when you use that Faith how many wants to use that faith when you use that faith on him Satan will have to back up Hallelujah and we see that's exactly what shamgar did he wasn't a warrior he didn't go get training all he said there's one thing I know I'm circumcised I'm an Israelite and then this promise belongs to me this grain belongs to me these promises belong to me can we have a sham guard tonight regardless of your feelings regardless of circumstances shamgar begin to think shamgar begin to think maybe sitting in a church service just like this shamgar begin to think this is for me and he could hear the footsteps of the enemy coming in just like sometimes that you do and I do the enemy's coming in like a flood but there's one thing I know when the enemy comes in like a flood my Lord Jesus lifts a standard against him and Sham go said there's one thing I know maybe the preacher was preaching about the same thing and he was telling about David and how David said a thousand can come this side and fall to this side 10,000 at this hand but it cannot come nigh unto thee and maybe he was rehearsing those words brother Mike in his head have you ever done that how many's been going through a trial and all of a sudden a song Dr drops in your heart or a message drops in your heart you go begin to put you you begin to find that message on your phone or your tablet or your computer and you begin to say oh man thank the Lord let's let's begin to listen things that are to be and you begin to push play and all of a sudden he might have preached that message 40 50 years ago but our God In His Infinite mind before the foundation of the world was orchestrating that message just for you and your trial and then your circumstances come on somebody that's one thing I know God works in your past lives in your your present working in your future he's got all things in his control and maybe that's what shamgar did he be to listen and all of a sudden something his righteous indonation begin to build up he began to get so mad at that demon that keeps tormenting his home taking his food tormenting his children taking clothes off his children's back am been taking everything from his sweetheart his wife there was something begin to build up not today devil not today devil oh if we could have that same attitude tonight amen not today devil you're not taking my joy today devil you're not taking my praise today devil and something began it wasn't a fairy tale when these these Bible stories is not fair fairy tales the reality they men of God that took God at his word and all shamgar had I'm not a warrior I had no training but this one thing I know I'm circumcised my name is in the book Oh Glory there's one thing I know tonight I've been notified the the the wheel the Seal's been broken off the wheel and the executive the Holy Spirit has come in this hour to notify me this one thing I know I might be a failure here I might be a failure in my spirit but down inside my soul amen is's a seal of Promise the world world didn't give it and the world can't take it away I know I'm sealed to the day of my Redemption and maybe brother Harvey he kept fighting the battle he kept fighting and Waring against his flesh his flesh was saying there's no need to go down there they're going to take your meal you can need allow them to do it now or go down there and get whipped like a a wet puppy amen go down there and get whipped and crawling back to your family but there was something down in his soul was burning and speaking a different story hallelujah amen that story was telling him go to the enemy's Camp take back what belongs to you you go down in my name you strike in my name you hit him in my name oh I'm telling you tonight amen if you hit him in his name amen go ahead try it one time tonight you need your family go ahead hit in his name it can never fa and I can see shamgar bubbling maybe like brother Ram would say about Caleb that hooknose Jew bouncing up and down getting excited about what the Lord is doing getting excited about the move of God and man no doubt brother Harold maybe shamgar begin to see it not by natural eyes but by faith and that Faith brought a substance and he begin to see it it became a reality to him and he brother Stuart he be to see soldiers laying everywhere dead destroyed cuz hope wasn't talking any longer Fai was on the inside looking out and declaring to shamard your battle is already over the victory has been won Hallelujah and here come the enemy in like a flood they had big helmets they had big shields they had big sh swords maybe they had big horses maybe they had big names maybe they was Presidents maybe they was great warriors it didn't matter who they were it didn't matter what artillery they had it didn't matter one thing cuz brother Bown said when Moses struck with that Rod it wasn't Moses striking it was God striking why cuz he wasn't going on his own ability his own thinking he was going on a noo God told him to do it and Moses done it and God backed it up and shamgar had a Pentecostal Jubilee and a Revival came to his house and no doubt his wife said shamgar you're losing your mind you ain't got no gun you ain't got no sword he said but I got an ox goat what are you going to do with that Ox goat I don't know but something inside of me says go down to the enemy's Camp go down and start swinging and the spirit of God said I'm going to do the West Church I'm here to declare to you when shamgar jumped out of that window and ran down to the enemy amen they thought the game was over amen they probably begin to think who's coming in it probably sounded like a rushing Mighty Wind Maybe sounded like when Gideon and his few hundred men was taken over down there that day and all of a sudden maybe it's just like some of these young people tend to take what they had in their hand it doesn't take much it doesn't take much all it takes is a mighty hand of God behind the swing and every time shamgar swung God swung with him and begin to hit every enemy that he struck he was destroying I'm here to tell you sham guard defeated hundreds and hundreds upon hundreds of well trained well equipped Army a Onan Invasion oh I'm here to tell you tonight that we're the Life Tabernacle amen one person tonight can stir a Revival in the camp if you can take what you got in your hand say I'm a housewife it doesn't matter amen take what you got and begin to beat their heads in in the name of Jesus in the name of Jesus in the name of Jesus have you ever tried it I know one thing there's power in the name of Jesus Hallelujah don't you love the Lord and he says they claim claim your god-given privilege and beat their heads in get out of the way Satan kick him out of the way kick him out of the way I'm the guy that's taking over now you've been tormenting my home long enough but I'm coming with an ox go tonight and I'm taking over the situation in my home I come in Jesus name he said watch them scatter brother when you use that faith on him he will back up because you're not guessing at it you're not probing at it brother B you know I know my redeemer liveth and we're going to drive out the scripture said we're going to drive out you're going to drive out all the enemy little by little how brother

out tonight you can do it drive it back by the power of God's word do we have time to go down to another Old Testament is this okay 2 Samuel 17 we all know about David but we're going to read about it again do you love him I me's I'm having a good time tonight hope this is okay and this 32nd verse hang on I'm in the wrong chapter that's why I should put it on my iPad huh well we'll find it in a second slow here we go and David said unto Saul let no man's heart fail because of him thou servant will go and fight with the Philistine and Saul said to David thou are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him for thou are but a youth and he a man of war from his Youth and D David said unto Saul thy servant kept his father's sheep and there came a lion and a bear and I and took a lamb out of the flock and went and I went out after him and smoted him delivered him out of his mouth and when he arose against me caught him by his beard and smoted him and slew him and thou servant slew both The Lion and the bear and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be shall be as one of them seeing he has defiled the armies of the Living God oh how many he's going through a battle can we have this attitude seeing we can speak with authority sin he is defiling the armies of a living God David said moreover the Lord that delivered me out of the Paul the lion the Paul out of the Bear's mouth will deliver me out of the hand of the Philistine and Saul said un David go and the 38th verse say Saul armed David with his armor and he put a helmet of brass upon his head armed him with a coat of male and David gted his sword upon his armor and said him to go for he had not proved it don't you like that it wasn't have no so to him I've never fought like this before Saul begin to put on a garments of uh of man David says I I didn't have this there's one thing I know when the enemy was coming in like a flood no matter he had the strength of a lion I had the ability to overcome it when he came in with the strength to the bear I didn't have nothing but my bare hands and I went down and grabbed him by his beard and I slew the lion and I slew the bear and I'm here to tell you Saul this has not been proved and I'm not going to wear it I'm going to go down to the enemy's camp with what I know that works hallelujah how many want how many of you wants to go there with me tonight I cannot go with these for has not proved them and David put them off can we put off that doubt tonight can we put off these things that men try to put on us churches try to put on us and begin to put them off and look at this and he took his staff in his hand and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook and put them in his Shepherd's bag which he had in his gript and he slung it with his hand and he drew near until to the Philistine the 44th verse says and the Philistines said to David you come to me and I'll give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air and to the beasts of the field and said David to the Philistine thou comes me with a sword with a spear with a shield but I come to thee In The Name Of The Lord of the hosts the god of the armies of Israel whom thou Hast defiled this day will the Lord deliver thee into my hands he's not talking about guesswork he's living it I say David already seen Goliath defeated Hallelujah he's not speaking by mentality he's speaking by the supernatural you come to me with a spear and a sword but I come to you in the name of the Lord hallelujah this day the Lord would deliver thee into my hand I'm going to take thy head off and I will smite thee and take thy head from theee and I will give the carcass of the host of listings this day and to the fowls of the air to the wild beasts of the earth that all the Earth may know that there is a God of Israel and all the semless should know the Lord save it not with a sword or a spear for the battle is the Lord's and he will give it into my hands and brother BR said and Little David standing there with a little piece of leather goat skin in his tied to two two pieces of strength tied together but it was revealed to him Revelation struck him Hallelujah Revelation strucking the no so struck him come on somebody when David was bouncing up and down running down to the enemy to fight he wasn't guessing he wasn't wondering well is this going to happen no Revelation shuck him no so shuck him he knew the battle wasn't David's it was the Lords do you have that Revelation tonight he said the god that took me out of the Pauls of the bear out of the paws of a lion how much more will he deliver this uncircumcised devil into my hands his brother's way was more able military-wise than David he said Saul was Head and Shoulders above his army but you see it wasn't revealed to them they wasn't notified it wasn't revealed to them amen he said there it is they believed it could be done they belied that God could do it but it wasn't revealed to them but it was revealed to David Hallelujah it was revealed to David and he said there is the difference right there it was absolutely revealed to you that God is going to heal you he said if it's sister Carla if it's absolutely revealed to you you're going to get it he said you're going to get it hell can't stop it circumstances can't stop it Wells belly can't stop it the deep sea can't stop it I don't care what's wrong with you he says he said I don't care what odds are stacked against you it made me worse than David and Goliath but if it's revealed to you if you know it David he said when it's revealed David become Fearless Hallelujah David become Fearless when the Revelation struck his heart brother Harvey David become Fearless that's the reason he could tell him the camp he's going to be like one
