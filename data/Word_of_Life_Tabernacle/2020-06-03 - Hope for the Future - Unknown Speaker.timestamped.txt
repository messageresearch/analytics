[30:36] God bless you thank you for coming
[30:39] tonight we're going to turn to Romans
[30:41] chapter 4 we'll start reading in verse
[30:44] 13 we'll read down to verse 18 Romans
[30:47] chapter 4 and verse
[30:50] 13 again thank you for being in the
[30:53] house of the Lord I I feel very special
[30:56] towards those who come on Wednesday
[30:57] night not that we're at all special and
[31:00] I know some are away and some it's too
[31:02] far to come on a Wednesday night but for
[31:04] those of you that are here and those of
[31:06] you that are listening tonight uh
[31:08] there's a special blessing for you
[31:10] because you uh in spite of your work
[31:12] week and the things that you've got
[31:14] going on you want to be in the house of
[31:15] God and so you've set aside a couple
[31:19] hours of your day of your week to come
[31:21] and so we know it won't be void because
[31:24] the word of God doesn't go forth void
[31:26] and we're going to read the word and and
[31:28] if that's all you get out of it all week
[31:30] long that'd be something that'd be
[31:32] something Eternal in in a life full of
[31:35] just the mundanity and the things that
[31:37] we go through every day we can brother
[31:39] Caleb come to the house of God and hear
[31:40] the word of God that is eternal and know
[31:43] we've got something that'll help us amen
[31:46] so I want to speak to you tonight on
[31:48] Hope for the Future Hope for the future
[31:51] and Romans chapter 4 and verse 13 for
[31:54] the promise that he should be the heir
[31:57] of the world
[31:58] was not to Abraham or to his seed
[32:00] through the law but through the
[32:03] righteousness of
[32:04] faith for for if they which are of the
[32:07] law be Hees faith is made void and the
[32:11] promise made of none effect because the
[32:14] law worketh wrath for where no law is
[32:18] there is no
[32:20] transgression therefore it is a faith
[32:23] that it might be by grace to the end or
[32:27] the result that the promise might be
[32:29] sure to all the seed not to that only
[32:33] which is of the law but to that also
[32:35] which is of the faith of Abraham who is
[32:38] the father of us all so he says that's
[32:40] what brings us into the picture is the
[32:43] promise of faith if it wasn't for that
[32:45] we'd be out just by virtue of our
[32:48] nationality so he said he's the father
[32:51] of us all and he says as it is written I
[32:53] have made thee a father of many nations
[32:55] before him whom he believed even in God
[32:58] who quickeneth the dead and calleth
[33:01] those things which be not as though they
[33:03] were who against hope believed in hope
[33:08] that he might become the father of many
[33:10] nations you don't become the father of
[33:13] many nations by being a weakling or a
[33:15] coward but he said against hope he
[33:17] believed in Hope or in other words where
[33:19] there's no reason to hope he had hope
[33:23] that he might become the father of many
[33:24] nations according to that which was
[33:26] spoken so so shall thy seed be amen
[33:31] that's us amen I pray the Lord would add
[33:34] his Blessing to the word you may be
[33:37] seated for just a few
[33:42] moments it's almost too obvious of a
[33:45] statement to make but we live in
[33:47] troubling
[33:50] times we are buffeted from within and
[33:53] from without and you look on the outside
[33:56] and you think that we had the Corona
[33:58] virus and we had the you have the Sodom
[34:02] condition of the world anyway that it's
[34:04] in just just think back over the last 10
[34:07] or 15 years and think what it's come to
[34:10] today and I can remember I couldn't have
[34:14] imagined the world that we lived in
[34:16] today when I was a
[34:17] teenager I couldn't imagine what it
[34:20] would be like that all these things
[34:22] would be legalized that we would have be
[34:24] living in the kind of world that we live
[34:26] in today
[34:28] we have the modern church and the
[34:29] condition that it's in and I don't think
[34:31] any of us as Believers would want to
[34:34] approximate that or be like that as we
[34:36] see the the church literally fulfilling
[34:40] the vision that brother randam had when
[34:41] he saw the the Church of the United
[34:44] States going down into hell and marching
[34:47] to that rock and roll beat with the
[34:49] nudity and the things and you see the
[34:51] church today fulfilling that just
[34:53] walking right into that vision and but
[34:57] thank God there was another part to the
[34:58] vision that there was a bride also that
[35:01] the bride would not go down but the
[35:03] bride would go up and if that part of
[35:05] the vision is being fulfilled that the
[35:07] world and the the worldly church the
[35:09] church of the United States would go
[35:11] down then there has to be a a part
[35:13] that's fulfilled that the church or the
[35:15] bride is going up so there there's a
[35:18] Sodom condition though in the world
[35:19] there's a modern Church there's riots
[35:22] and lawlessness and and you have
[35:25] lawlessness in the police force but then
[35:28] you have lawlessness in the
[35:30] streets and every reaction as I said
[35:32] Sunday is worse than the action before
[35:35] it and so it just keeps digging itself a
[35:37] deeper hole every time nothing gets
[35:40] fixed it just keeps getting
[35:43] worse but the scriptures tell us that
[35:46] these things are the beginning of
[35:47] Sorrows in Matthew chapter 24:8 he said
[35:50] all these the beginning of Sorrows he
[35:53] speaks of war and rumors of war and all
[35:55] distress among nations and all those
[35:57] things he he said these are the
[35:58] beginnings of of Sorrows or this is the
[36:01] first part of the birth pains this is
[36:05] that time period when you're getting up
[36:07] close sister Vicki to the end and you
[36:09] realize that if you've been through a
[36:12] pregnancy as my wife and I have I said
[36:14] use that Loosely but but we've got three
[36:17] children and so we've been through
[36:20] pregnancy and and I remember there being
[36:23] some labor pains before the baby was
[36:25] born that's what he's speaking of this
[36:28] is the beginning of Sorrows this
[36:30] indication that is coming that it's
[36:32] getting close and we can see that and
[36:35] we've seen that in the last 2,000 years
[36:38] has just kept cycling closer and closer
[36:40] and closer we could go on about that all
[36:42] night but these are those birth pains
[36:45] but brother random speaks of it this way
[36:47] in The Invisible Union Union of the
[36:49] bride of Christ he says the complete
[36:50] total
[36:52] insanity this world will get into he
[36:55] said right away he said we'll go into
[36:57] right away way he said it's almost there
[36:59] now he said why you see the footsteps of
[37:03] it you can see where they're making the
[37:07] tracks he was saying you you can tell
[37:09] that it's around well now today you can
[37:12] see
[37:13] it it's right out on the streets and
[37:15] then you could see the footsteps of it
[37:17] he said there it is it's marching right
[37:19] out on the street right down the church
[37:23] pew total
[37:26] insanity do things that a human being
[37:29] wouldn't think of doing and being
[37:31] civilized that's the hour that we live
[37:34] in oh I'm so thankful for the message of
[37:36] the hour today so thankful for the word
[37:39] of God that makes us love I don't want
[37:41] to live without this message I don't
[37:43] want to live without this word because
[37:45] what does it do it keeps us sane in an
[37:47] insane
[37:49] generation it's insane and so he says he
[37:53] says that and he says oh God in another
[37:55] place in leadership he said oh God let
[37:58] me go Lord don't leave me behind Jesus
[38:01] let me go with you father I don't want
[38:04] to stay here on this Earth to watch
[38:06] these tribulations coming on so in other
[38:09] words I I hear and I feel and I see the
[38:11] birth pains and I don't want to be a
[38:14] part of that tribulation period when
[38:16] it's down to the wire when those last
[38:18] moments of the earth when those last
[38:21] spasms H the Earth as we talked about
[38:23] the drgs of the cup of God's Wrath when
[38:25] that takes place I don't want to be here
[38:27] at that time so I'm going to avoid that
[38:31] he said Lord let me
[38:32] go where do I want to go I want to go in
[38:35] a
[38:36] Rapture so he went by way of the grave
[38:39] but he's coming in a resurrection the
[38:40] dead in Christ shall rise first and
[38:42] people say brother bram's coming back
[38:44] yes he is with all the other
[38:47] Saints it's not just him but all the
[38:49] other Saints all the saints are coming
[38:51] back amen but now we find this this age
[38:55] of insanity we want to escape that so he
[38:58] says I don't want to stay here on this
[38:59] Earth to watch these tribulations coming
[39:01] on I don't want to stay here in this
[39:03] Insanity I don't want to stand here when
[39:06] these hideous sights the people losing
[39:08] their mind and my son was telling me on
[39:11] the way over here on the drive over that
[39:14] Toyota is putting out a they're working
[39:16] on a car that will be like a a pet you
[39:19] know people have emotional support pets
[39:23] and they're working on a car that will
[39:24] be an emotional support car
[39:27] if this isn't true blame Peter for it
[39:29] because I didn't have time to look it up
[39:31] but but he said they're working on this
[39:33] emotional support car that will actually
[39:37] sense when you are are needy emotionally
[39:39] and it will talk to you and it will talk
[39:42] you out of
[39:43] it that's the hour we live in it's going
[39:47] into
[39:49] insanity and I've got all kinds of ideas
[39:52] what that might be I need to look that
[39:53] up but he says he says I don't want to
[39:56] stand here when people are losing their
[39:58] mind he said we look at men trying to
[40:01] act like beasts and look like
[40:03] beasts women trying to look like animals
[40:05] with the paints on their
[40:08] face he said knowing that these things
[40:10] are predicted to happen that the thing
[40:13] will they'll go so insane to Locust will
[40:15] raise up with hair like women to haunt
[40:17] the women teeth like lions and things
[40:18] that you said the mental condition of
[40:20] the people will be completely
[40:23] gone he said we see it in the making
[40:26] right now
[40:28] Lord help us and he says this he said
[40:31] restore us to the sane mind of Christ
[40:36] Jesus our
[40:38] lord and you see the way the world goes
[40:40] and Satan will get a hold of a person
[40:42] and you watch them they'll do something
[40:43] that it's just insane it makes no
[40:46] sense but they'll they'll reason it out
[40:49] and they'll have a an idea this is the
[40:51] way it's supposed to be and they'll grab
[40:52] a hold of that but it makes no sense and
[40:55] they may have their reasons but it makes
[40:57] no sense to do what they do makes no
[40:59] sense for black people to Rob black
[41:02] businesses because a a white cop killed
[41:05] a black man and then kill black people
[41:07] it makes no sense no more sense than it
[41:10] made for the cop to do that in the first
[41:12] place it made no
[41:13] sense it was crazy and you look at the
[41:16] world that we live in it doesn't make
[41:17] it's
[41:18] insane and people just don't have common
[41:20] courtesy
[41:22] anymore we just run over each other it
[41:24] doesn't matter and you take a prophet of
[41:26] God look at the attitude of a prophet of
[41:28] God a prophet of God wasn't ever that
[41:30] way he said we believe in
[41:32] life when he went to plead for the life
[41:35] for those young people that have been
[41:36] caught up in all that those problems he
[41:38] said we believe in
[41:41] life but we see the world in the making
[41:43] he said right now and that was back then
[41:45] but he said restore us to the same mind
[41:47] of Christ Jesus our lord listen that's
[41:50] what we need and it'll only come by the
[41:52] word it's got to be something that comes
[41:54] by the word that the word can actually
[41:56] restore us us back to sanity it's not
[41:59] that the word is is making us where
[42:03] we're weird or odd or different but the
[42:06] word is making us
[42:09] Sint and there's nobody that looks as
[42:11] weird as the samee person among insane
[42:20] people you walk through a world of
[42:23] people who are insane you don't look
[42:25] sane you look different you don't look
[42:28] normal but thank God for
[42:34] that what is
[42:38] Hope biblically hope is something
[42:40] different than what it is in in our
[42:43] common common vernacular if I could put
[42:45] it that way it's hope to us
[42:47] is means well I hope it happens so I'm
[42:50] not real sure it's going to right it's
[42:53] something that you know you hope for you
[42:56] hope for a lot of things
[42:58] but that's not biblical hope biblical
[42:59] hope is
[43:01] expectation brother brandham deals with
[43:03] that in in the sermon expectation he
[43:06] talks about how our expectations what
[43:08] they should be he said now if God has
[43:11] promised a Revival here we're going to
[43:13] have it he's speaking to these people as
[43:16] these come into town and these churches
[43:18] pull together and bring brother brandom
[43:20] in they want to have a Revival they want
[43:21] to see people healed they want to see
[43:23] people saved and brother brandom comes
[43:24] in there he said if God has promised a
[43:26] Revival here we're going to have it
[43:28] let's make ready for it if God promised
[43:31] to heal let's make ready for it he said
[43:34] Jesus said the works that I do show you
[43:36] also let's make ready for it move out
[43:38] everything get ready we're right in time
[43:42] he said now it'll seem
[43:45] foolish now you say well how's it going
[43:48] to happen in a day like this and when
[43:51] all this I want you to think about that
[43:54] in the in the context of what's going on
[43:57] in the world right now how's it going to
[43:59] happen in a day like this when all
[44:03] this huh all this riding all this
[44:07] looting all this Corona virus all this
[44:10] trouble all this trouble on the internal
[44:13] side in the church all these problems
[44:15] that we've had how's it going to happen
[44:16] in a day like
[44:19] this but what what did we read in our
[44:22] text Abraham against hope believed in
[44:25] hope when had no right to expect
[44:28] anything he expected it
[44:31] anyway so how's it going to happen in a
[44:34] day like this and when all this he said
[44:36] I don't care what anything contrary is
[44:39] to that it's wrong he said we can't see
[44:43] it now you're it's a prophet of God
[44:45] speaking he said we can't see
[44:47] it now listen even a prophet of God
[44:50] could only see he could see so far he
[44:52] could see that maybe by 1977 it'd be so
[44:55] black that he couldn't even see any
[44:57] further we look at that and think what
[45:00] what kind of Hope do we have then if if
[45:02] the angel of God even wrote Leo deia
[45:04] with all
[45:05] Blackness all Darkness but we have a a a
[45:09] hope an expectation because the
[45:10] scripture says Rise and Shine for thy
[45:13] light has come so we have an expectation
[45:16] of something greater we have an
[45:17] expectation of something better too many
[45:19] times we get our eyes on what we can't
[45:21] see well I don't see any people around
[45:24] me I don't see things going on and so we
[45:27] we react in that way but somebody's got
[45:29] to be a soldier somebody's got to be
[45:31] willing to step into the battle
[45:33] somebody's got to be willing to be like
[45:34] Abraham and say I see
[45:37] it against hope I Believe In Hope
[45:39] because not because I can see it with my
[45:41] natural eyes I I don't see how it's
[45:43] going to happen and I have forgive me
[45:46] for making it personal but I've had
[45:47] people lately come to me and say brother
[45:49] Ben I don't see how you're going to do
[45:50] what you're doing but but it's it's not
[45:52] you can't see it with these eyes you got
[45:55] to be able to see beyond that you've got
[45:57] that there's got to be somebody that can
[45:59] look at what can be according to the
[46:02] word not according to the people not
[46:03] according to the situation but according
[46:05] to the word what kind of church can we
[46:07] have what kind of people can we
[46:10] be huh you look at your children or your
[46:13] grandchildren or maybe somebody that's
[46:15] out of the Ark of Safety and they're
[46:16] away from church and you look and say
[46:18] well they've done this and this and this
[46:20] what what hope is there for them but you
[46:22] don't look at what you can see you look
[46:24] at what can be look at what the word
[46:26] proom promised
[46:30] you we can't see it I see no hope of it
[46:33] look like but if God said so let's do it
[46:36] anyhow cuz God said so it'll happen
[46:39] anyhow I'm expecting
[46:43] it can you imagine what those two girls
[46:46] must have thought when Mary and Martha
[46:49] when Jesus had roll the stone
[46:51] away Lazarus was still dead and by this
[46:55] time he stinketh
[46:59] he was in the grave and he'd been there
[47:01] long enough he was already
[47:02] decaying and they'd never seen that
[47:05] before but it was at Thy word
[47:08] Lord he said but see he had to have them
[47:11] do it it wasn't Jesus didn't walk up
[47:13] there and push the stone away himself he
[47:15] said roll the stone away he gave the
[47:17] command and somebody had to have the
[47:19] faith to stand there and carry out the
[47:21] commands of Christ see that's what we're
[47:23] doing here tonight somebody's got to
[47:25] have the faith to come on a Wednesday
[47:26] tonight and carry out the commands of
[47:28] Christ and say I'm going to do it anyhow
[47:31] it might be hard it might be difficult
[47:33] it might be a troubling time that we're
[47:34] going through but I'm going to do it
[47:36] anyhow why because that God said it
[47:38] could happen and against hope we believe
[47:40] in
[47:42] Hope hey
[47:44] man he said if God said so let's do it
[47:47] anyhow CU God said so it'll happen
[47:49] anyhow I'm expecting
[47:52] him now the Bible tells us that faith is
[47:55] the substance of things hoped
[47:58] for the substance of
[48:00] expectation and when the Bible speaks of
[48:03] expectation it doesn't just speak of a
[48:04] general
[48:07] expectation or a positive
[48:10] attitude but it's a specific
[48:14] expectation based on promises
[48:17] made see the Israelites always expected
[48:22] Jerusalem to be the city of God based on
[48:26] promise proes made they expected a
[48:29] messiah based on promises made they
[48:33] expected God to do certain things now
[48:36] they may have misunderstood many of
[48:38] those promises but they base that on the
[48:40] promises made it was an expectation and
[48:43] so you find that after thousands of
[48:47] years of the people believing in a
[48:48] messiah expecting Messiah here is Simeon
[48:52] standing there in a temple and he still
[48:54] expects God to fulfill his word
[48:58] and it becomes such an expectation in
[49:00] his life brother Harvey that he took it
[49:02] personally and it was revealed to him
[49:05] that he would not die until he saw the
[49:09] Messiah and to the world that looked
[49:11] crazy but see I believe that happens to
[49:14] us when we we come to this the message
[49:15] of the hour there's got to be an
[49:17] expectation there that's more than just
[49:19] a general expectation but a specific
[49:21] expectation based on promises made there
[49:24] will be a Rapture and then there got to
[49:27] come of people like Simeon to say it's
[49:28] going to happen to
[49:33] me
[49:34] now Hebrews 11 and8 says by faith
[49:38] Abraham when he was called to go out
[49:41] into a place which he should after
[49:43] receive for an inheritance obeyed and he
[49:45] went out not knowing whether he went he
[49:49] went out not knowing with he went by
[49:52] faith he soured in the land of promise
[49:55] as in a strange country country dwelling
[49:58] in Tabernacles or tents with Isaac and
[50:00] Jacob HS with him of the same
[50:04] promise for he looked for a
[50:09] city he looked for a city which have
[50:14] foundations whose Builder and maker is
[50:18] God now he looked for that word looked
[50:21] for is to receive or to accept and also
[50:24] to
[50:25] expect so he accepted that the word of
[50:28] God was true that there was a city and
[50:31] then he expected it so he waited for it
[50:35] but he never saw
[50:37] it huh he never saw it but by faith God
[50:41] led him right to the spot where it would
[50:46] be so brother bham tells us the future
[50:48] home of the Heavenly bridegroom and the
[50:49] Earthly bride he said are you ready he
[50:51] said this is the city that Abraham was
[50:53] looking for
[50:57] what our future
[50:58] home that City that he's talking about
[51:02] that that New Jerusalem this is the city
[51:04] that Abraham was looking for see being a
[51:06] prophet he knew that city was somewhere
[51:08] the Bible said so and he forsook the
[51:11] city he lived and he went over he said
[51:13] look where he went exactly where it'll
[51:16] be he was looking for a city whose
[51:19] Builder and maker was God he said being
[51:22] a prophet and Abraham was looking for it
[51:24] and he professed he was a pilgrim and a
[51:26] stranger for he looked for a city whose
[51:29] Builder and maker was God that Prophet
[51:31] knowing it was somewhere John saw it
[51:34] coming down but Abraham thought it must
[51:36] be on earth right
[51:38] then why because he had that
[51:40] expectation God didn't tell him when it
[51:42] would be he just said there would be a
[51:44] city so Abraham looked for a
[51:47] city amen he was oh my if we just
[51:52] recognize that he looked for a city but
[51:53] he couldn't settle for Sodom
[51:56] see lot found a city he
[51:59] liked I hope you're with me tonight lot
[52:02] found a city that he liked and he was
[52:03] comfortable sitting there until God
[52:06] destroyed it and God sent him up into
[52:08] the mountains and he begged him to take
[52:10] him to another city because he was
[52:12] looking for a city but he found comfort
[52:14] in the in the things of the world in the
[52:16] cities of this world but
[52:18] Abraham lived in the
[52:21] country amen lived on the mountains why
[52:24] because he was looking for a city that
[52:26] was better than Sodom oh I hope we keep
[52:29] sight of that today we're looking for a
[52:31] country for a city that's better than
[52:33] this one that we live
[52:34] in that's why we don't get caught up in
[52:37] all the things that are going on because
[52:39] if we get too caught up in that we start
[52:41] looking for a city here that's what
[52:43] communism does they want to build a
[52:44] Utopia here that's what many people do
[52:47] and all every politician that comes
[52:49] along well I'm going to build this we're
[52:51] going to do this we're going to make it
[52:52] the way it should be but remember it'll
[52:54] never be how it should be
[52:57] amen until the king of Peace comes there
[53:00] will never be peace until the king of
[53:02] Peace comes there will never but there
[53:03] is coming a
[53:05] city we're going to live in that Abraham
[53:09] looked for amen he said Abraham thought
[53:13] it must be on earth right then he said
[53:15] why why did he think it must be right
[53:17] then he said he met MDC the king of it
[53:21] and gave him a
[53:23] tithe which had no father nor mother no
[53:26] beginning of Life or no ending of Life
[53:28] Abraham met him and they took communion
[53:31] on the literal spot where the city will
[53:34] be raised up the Holy Mountain of the
[53:36] Lord where the redeemed will
[53:40] live can I tell you something
[53:42] tonight listen we expect a
[53:46] city we have a hope for the
[53:49] future because we met a
[53:53] king we met
[53:55] MDC and and so we expect a better City
[53:59] because we met the king of the city and
[54:01] he said I go and prepare a place for
[54:04] you amen and we know that we have a body
[54:07] there we know we have a a life there
[54:09] there's something that we've been in the
[54:11] mind of God all this time and so we know
[54:13] it's there we met him we met him we've
[54:16] taken communion if we could put it that
[54:18] way on the spot where that City will be
[54:21] and I don't mean in this case Abraham on
[54:23] the literal spot but for us we do that
[54:25] in Christ
[54:27] we have communion we take communion not
[54:29] so much in a building but in Christ in
[54:32] the in the body of Christ we take
[54:34] communion on a spot where the city will
[54:37] be raised up the Holy Mountain of the
[54:39] Lord where the redeemed will live oh my
[54:41] why do we expect things different than
[54:43] the world does because we
[54:48] medicate you could hear all about
[54:51] they're being a city of Atlantis you
[54:54] would never believe it
[54:56] because no one's ever met the king of
[55:00] Atlantis it's not a city that it may be
[55:02] mythical or whatever it's supposed to be
[55:04] a city under the water the sink under
[55:06] the sea and there's no there's no record
[55:09] of it that you could ever prove because
[55:11] you can't meet meet the
[55:13] king you've never met the king but this
[55:16] city you've met the king of the city and
[55:19] so you have confidence that it's
[55:21] there so you live under the
[55:23] administration of that
[55:25] kingship even though we're not there yet
[55:28] are you with me
[55:30] now
[55:32] so the Bible speaks of Hope in Jeremiah
[55:36] chapter 31:15 or this specific hope
[55:39] because this was the hope of Israel that
[55:41] there would be a land there would be a
[55:43] place there would be a restoration so no
[55:46] matter what happened in the meantime
[55:47] they always had this
[55:49] hope and Jeremiah 31:15 says thus sayith
[55:52] the Lord a voice was heard in Rama
[55:54] lamentation and bitter weeping
[55:57] Rachel weeping for her children refusing
[55:59] to be comforted for her children because
[56:02] they were
[56:03] not they were not and he said thus
[56:06] sayith the Lord refrain thy voice from
[56:09] weeping thine eyes from tears for thy
[56:12] Works shall be rewarded sayith the Lord
[56:15] they shall come again from the land of
[56:16] the
[56:17] enemy he said and there is hope in thine
[56:24] end there is hope in thine end that's
[56:28] where our real hope our specific hope is
[56:31] and that affects everything else that we
[56:34] do our hope is not here it's in the
[56:39] end it's in thine end sayi the Lord
[56:43] because every one of us are going to
[56:44] have an
[56:45] end when it comes to this life every one
[56:48] of us will either go by way of the Grave
[56:50] or we'll go to Rapture there'll be an
[56:51] end but there's hope in thine end what
[56:55] did he say that God he said I know the
[56:57] thoughts that I think towards you to
[56:58] bring about an expected
[57:00] end an expected end thoughts of good
[57:03] thoughts of peace and not of evil he
[57:04] said there is hope in thine end say the
[57:07] Lord so he says I know you're going
[57:08] through it right now and Jeremiah being
[57:10] the weeping prophet had such a hard
[57:12] message to deliver because he was
[57:14] delivering it to a people he was telling
[57:16] them you've got to go back you got to go
[57:18] with them it's God's will that you go
[57:20] down into Babylon he said but there's
[57:21] hope in thine end I know it's hard now
[57:24] and I know there's trouble but there's
[57:26] Hope In the
[57:27] End
[57:29] Amen he said there's hope in thine end
[57:31] sayi the Lord thy children shall come
[57:32] again to their own border what we got to
[57:35] remember about our own children There's
[57:37] Hope in thine end turn you to the
[57:39] stronghold in Zechariah 9 and12 this is
[57:42] scripture was just powerful to me
[57:45] speaking these Jewish people these
[57:48] people who were had been through so much
[57:51] he says turn you to the stronghold
[57:53] there's a stronghold there's a Christ
[57:56] that's coming there's a messiah turning
[57:58] you to the stronghold turn to the word
[58:01] ye prisoners of
[58:04] hope they were prisoners of Hope and the
[58:08] world mocked them because the world did
[58:11] whatever it took to get ahead in the
[58:13] moment that is the way of the cosmos I
[58:17] hope you're hearing me tonight the
[58:18] cosmos the way of this world where he
[58:20] said love not the world love not the
[58:21] cosmos or the things of the world
[58:24] because the way of the cosmos is
[58:26] to take advantage of right now for the
[58:29] moment that's the way of the world but
[58:32] here the Jews were always different
[58:34] because they were looking for a better
[58:36] hope they were looking for something
[58:38] more they weren't looking for the moment
[58:40] but they were saying Lord someday you'll
[58:43] restore us and the people that conquer
[58:46] them didn't understand look you're a
[58:47] conquered people why don't you just go
[58:49] away and assimilate with all the rest of
[58:52] us and become like us and the Jews for
[58:54] thousands of years May main their
[58:56] testimony and their dignity and their
[58:58] religion why did they do that because
[59:00] they had a
[59:02] hope amen turn you to the stronghold you
[59:05] prisoners of hope they were prisoners of
[59:07] Hope their lives and everything was
[59:09] ruled by that they couldn't just be like
[59:12] any other Nation they were a peculiar
[59:14] people you and I are the same way today
[59:17] we are prisoners of Hope even today said
[59:20] do I declare that I will render double
[59:21] unto thee amen what a promise now look
[59:26] acts 23
[59:29] and6 but the time of
[59:31] Paul hope this hope had become a belief
[59:36] in the
[59:37] resurrection a belief in the
[59:39] resurrection there wasn't a maybe a
[59:42] specific understanding of the
[59:43] Resurrection in the Old Testament even
[59:46] though job spake of it in many other
[59:48] scriptures in in the Old Testament but
[59:50] in the New Testament it becomes crystal
[59:52] clear and it becomes clear frankly
[59:55] because of the death burial and
[59:56] resurrection of
[59:58] Christ because he was the first fruits
[1:00:01] he showed it could be
[1:00:02] done right so the resurrection existed
[1:00:05] only in theory to the Jewish people it
[1:00:09] was a theory that they had that there
[1:00:11] would be a resurrection so the Pharisees
[1:00:13] believed in a resurrection the Sadducees
[1:00:15] did not they didn't have this hope but
[1:00:18] he says when Paul perceived he was he
[1:00:20] was before the the Sanhedrin Council and
[1:00:22] he perceived that one part were
[1:00:24] Sadducees and the other Pharisees he
[1:00:26] cried out in the counsil men and
[1:00:27] Brethren I am a Pharisee the son of a
[1:00:30] Pharisee The Hope and resurrection of
[1:00:32] the Dead I am called in question and
[1:00:35] Paul gets out of this basically because
[1:00:37] he sets them against one
[1:00:39] another maybe that's what the Lord's
[1:00:41] doing right
[1:00:43] now you know we're just kind of scooting
[1:00:46] by and everybody else is just fighting
[1:00:47] with one another but we don't join the
[1:00:50] fight but Paul says I I'm a Pharisee and
[1:00:52] he says all these Pharisees here believe
[1:00:54] in a resurrection and for that hope for
[1:00:57] that expectation I'm called in question
[1:01:00] and he was literally telling the truth
[1:01:03] because it was a resurrection of
[1:01:06] Christ the resurrection of Christ but he
[1:01:09] was telling it truth in a way they would
[1:01:11] understand because and brother brandham
[1:01:12] did that you'll find that many times in
[1:01:14] front of Pentecostal crowds he would
[1:01:15] tell the truth in a way that they would
[1:01:17] understand but yet we we recognized was
[1:01:20] still true but it was just put in in a
[1:01:23] frame that they would understand Paul
[1:01:24] does that also in Mars Hill to the
[1:01:26] Greeks in Acts
[1:01:28] 24:14 Paul again he said but this I
[1:01:31] confess unto thee that after the way
[1:01:32] which they call heresy so worship I the
[1:01:35] god of my fathers believing all things
[1:01:37] which are written in the law and in the
[1:01:39] prophets so again he's speaking of this
[1:01:43] and he said and have hope toward God
[1:01:45] which they themselves also allow so he's
[1:01:48] speaking to the king of gri I believe
[1:01:50] he's speaking to him and he says they
[1:01:52] have hope or claim to have hope as well
[1:01:55] that there will be a resurrection of the
[1:01:57] Dead both of the just and unjust yet
[1:02:00] they were persecuting Paul because he
[1:02:02] believed that it
[1:02:03] happened and the persecution we take in
[1:02:06] the message is not because we believe a
[1:02:09] prophet would come but we believe it
[1:02:12] already
[1:02:13] happened you go any any commentary you
[1:02:15] go almost any older commentary and
[1:02:17] you'll find they believed Elijah was
[1:02:20] coming and many people today want a
[1:02:22] profit but the uniqueness of the
[1:02:24] messages that we believe one's already
[1:02:27] come we've already had a prophet and
[1:02:30] we've seen the completion and the
[1:02:32] Fulfillment of that that that the third
[1:02:35] pole would be the last poll it's there's
[1:02:38] a finality to it that that's the
[1:02:41] end the the the last poll or the last
[1:02:44] attraction to the bride would be the
[1:02:47] word of
[1:02:48] God oh my he said but they themselves
[1:02:52] also allow there should be a
[1:02:53] resurrection of the Dead both the just
[1:02:54] and unjust and now I stand and I'm
[1:02:56] judged for the hope of the promise made
[1:02:59] of God unto our fathers unto which
[1:03:02] promise our 12 tribes instantly serving
[1:03:05] God day and night hope to come he said
[1:03:07] this is why we're different because we
[1:03:10] hope in a
[1:03:11] resurrection amen instantly serving God
[1:03:14] day and night hope to come for which
[1:03:16] Hope's sake King AG grippa I am accused
[1:03:18] of the Jews 1 Corinthians 15:19 let's
[1:03:22] look at this as Paul brings it down and
[1:03:24] kind of makes this hope very clear here
[1:03:26] he said if in this life only we have
[1:03:29] hope in Christ we are of all men most
[1:03:34] miserable so I want to set this forth
[1:03:36] today as our hope for the future is not
[1:03:39] a hope for the present but it brings
[1:03:42] hope to the
[1:03:44] present so our hope is a hope of an end
[1:03:48] our hope is a hope of what will be
[1:03:50] brother Curtis and especially as you get
[1:03:52] older you realize that your hope is what
[1:03:54] will be you got more years behind you
[1:03:56] than you do ahead of you so your hope is
[1:03:59] what will be but that brings hope to the
[1:04:02] present that brings a joy to your step
[1:04:04] today that makes you want to come to
[1:04:07] church that makes us want to keep doing
[1:04:09] the things that we're doing keep
[1:04:11] planting our potatoes why because we
[1:04:13] have a hope we have a hope if we have a
[1:04:16] hope in Christ we're if if we only had
[1:04:19] it in this life we are of all men most
[1:04:20] miserable but we are not of all men most
[1:04:23] miserable in fact we're the only ones
[1:04:25] that have real Joy boy why because our
[1:04:28] hope is not just in this life our hope
[1:04:31] is in another world our hope is in
[1:04:33] another city like Abraham's
[1:04:36] was we look for that
[1:04:39] City if if we only have hope in Christ
[1:04:41] we of all men most miserable this is the
[1:04:45] typical inscription on a grave in Paul's
[1:04:48] day it says I was not I became I am not
[1:04:55] and I care
[1:04:57] not that was the typical inscription in
[1:05:01] the world at that time that was the the
[1:05:03] Greek
[1:05:04] world I I was not I
[1:05:08] became you know so I just wasn't
[1:05:10] anything somehow I got here it sounds
[1:05:13] familiar doesn't it just big bang
[1:05:17] Evolution whatever that it was I was not
[1:05:19] I became I am not I care
[1:05:23] not doesn't matter
[1:05:26] because I lived for a while just like a
[1:05:28] dog would or or a horse would or any
[1:05:31] other
[1:05:31] creature and then all the sudden I am
[1:05:34] not I care not and so the the philosophy
[1:05:38] of the age led to
[1:05:41] hopelessness that's an hour that we live
[1:05:43] in today as well the philosophy of this
[1:05:46] age with atheism and communism and all
[1:05:48] these things that we see and even just
[1:05:51] just regular
[1:05:52] churchianity if you could say it that
[1:05:54] way just just the regular you know it
[1:05:57] really doesn't matter it really doesn't
[1:06:00] matter what you do because there's no
[1:06:02] hope in it anyway I was not I became I
[1:06:05] am not I care not let's just get the the
[1:06:07] most as as the one said in the scripture
[1:06:10] eat and drink for tomorrow we die
[1:06:14] hopelessness hopelessness oh my that was
[1:06:17] typical of the day but it was not
[1:06:19] typical of the believer but the believer
[1:06:22] was willing to sacrifice this life to go
[1:06:26] to a better
[1:06:28] place amen that's
[1:06:32] hope what does Hope
[1:06:35] do I want you to get this the hope of
[1:06:39] Salvation is protection for the mind of
[1:06:42] the Christian you
[1:06:45] remember that I I told you that as I
[1:06:48] read where brother BR said we're going
[1:06:49] into insanity and we'll look at some
[1:06:50] more of that you see the world just
[1:06:53] drifting into insanity
[1:06:55] but the hope of Salvation is protection
[1:06:57] for our
[1:06:59] minds so that we are not
[1:07:02] overcome by the darkness of the age and
[1:07:06] by the hopelessness of the
[1:07:10] age first Thessalonians 5:4 says but you
[1:07:13] Brethren are not in
[1:07:15] darkness amen you're not in darkness
[1:07:18] that that day should overtake you as a
[1:07:21] thief so you understand what's going
[1:07:24] on you're all the children of light and
[1:07:27] the children of the day we are not of
[1:07:30] the night nor of
[1:07:32] darkness and I want to kind of and maybe
[1:07:35] we'll get into this sometime but without
[1:07:37] this message you can't make sense of the
[1:07:39] last 2,000
[1:07:42] years it's hard to make sense of the
[1:07:44] church
[1:07:46] ages
[1:07:48] because you know what happened in the
[1:07:50] Protestant Revolution a lot of people
[1:07:52] drive themselves crazy or go back into
[1:07:54] Catholicism because are trying to make
[1:07:56] sense of what's happened in church
[1:07:58] history because but if you understand
[1:08:00] the message of the hour in the
[1:08:01] scriptures correctly you find out that a
[1:08:04] corn of wheat died in the ground it had
[1:08:06] to die so it could come up again an
[1:08:09] alpha and omega bride those are things
[1:08:10] we believe that are unique to the
[1:08:12] message those are things that are not
[1:08:14] necessarily taught out here in the
[1:08:15] church world so if it's just going on if
[1:08:18] it's just if everything just keeps going
[1:08:20] as it always has every morning is the
[1:08:22] same every night is the same then what
[1:08:24] what does it matter
[1:08:27] then it looks like God didn't keep his
[1:08:29] promise but if you can look back you can
[1:08:31] see we're not children of the darkness
[1:08:34] we're children of light light has come
[1:08:37] in the end time to show us what God's
[1:08:38] been doing all these
[1:08:40] years that he was working in the first
[1:08:43] church as he was working in the second
[1:08:44] and the third and the fourth and the
[1:08:46] fifth and the sixth God was
[1:08:48] working and so most denominations the
[1:08:50] Baptist can't explain
[1:08:52] Wesley they can't explain it they
[1:08:54] acknowledge it was the move of God but
[1:08:56] they can't explain it the wesle can't
[1:08:58] explain
[1:09:00] Pentecost they don't they can't cope
[1:09:02] with it can't comprehend it and so they
[1:09:05] have to just say well it was
[1:09:07] false right the Pentecostals don't can't
[1:09:09] explain the message of the hour they
[1:09:12] don't understand it but we understand
[1:09:14] there's a place for the for the
[1:09:16] Pentecostal there was a place for the
[1:09:17] wesle there was a place for the Baptists
[1:09:19] and the and the Lutheran and the
[1:09:21] Calvinists why because we believe the
[1:09:23] message of the hour those things just
[1:09:25] don't come out of nowhere and then what
[1:09:27] does that make us it makes us children
[1:09:29] of
[1:09:30] light we are children of light the
[1:09:32] children of of the day we're not of the
[1:09:34] night nor of Darkness we don't have to
[1:09:36] goow up around and go from here here to
[1:09:38] here and try to find what's true what's
[1:09:40] true is there truth maybe we
[1:09:41] misunderstood something maybe there's
[1:09:42] something that the church has never
[1:09:44] understood you mean God's never had a
[1:09:47] bride think about it when the Oneness
[1:09:50] Church come out with the name of God
[1:09:51] they didn't understand what had happened
[1:09:53] and that God winked in ignorance with
[1:09:55] Arian baptism they believe that
[1:09:56] trinitarian baptism was always wrong and
[1:09:59] and and it was but they don't understand
[1:10:02] what God was doing and so they throw out
[1:10:05] everything and say well here was some at
[1:10:08] the beginning and then it didn't happen
[1:10:09] again for 2,000 years God just didn't
[1:10:10] have a
[1:10:12] bride for 2,000 years now think about
[1:10:16] that we take for granted these things
[1:10:18] that we believe but we're children of
[1:10:22] light we're Children of the day we know
[1:10:26] we're not of the night we know what God
[1:10:28] was doing something and so we don't even
[1:10:30] have to be hopeless about those that are
[1:10:32] sealed into another age or those that
[1:10:34] are foolish virgin we realize God's got
[1:10:36] a handful of change in his pocket he's
[1:10:38] got pennies he's got quarters he got
[1:10:39] diamonds he's got dollars there's all
[1:10:41] kinds of people that are God's
[1:10:44] people we have room for them and hope
[1:10:47] for them are you with me even those that
[1:10:50] don't don't follow exactly what we
[1:10:52] believe but we we realize that God has
[1:10:54] got all kinds of people so we don't have
[1:10:56] to put anybody out let God do
[1:10:58] that right why because we're children of
[1:11:01] light Children of the day we're not of
[1:11:03] the night we're not of the darkness he
[1:11:05] said therefore let us not sleep as do
[1:11:08] others but let us watch and be
[1:11:12] sober
[1:11:14] sober that sober is to be sober of mind
[1:11:19] it doesn't mean not to drink but what it
[1:11:21] means is to not be overcome by your
[1:11:24] emotions
[1:11:26] to not be overcome by your emotions to
[1:11:28] not be so worried or so fearful that you
[1:11:32] have to change with every wind of
[1:11:33] Doctrine but to understand to be sober
[1:11:35] and understand what's going
[1:11:37] on for they that sleep sleep in the
[1:11:40] night they that be drunken are drunken
[1:11:42] in the night that's the people who don't
[1:11:44] understand but remember what Daniel said
[1:11:46] he said the wise will understand and
[1:11:48] know their God he said they that be
[1:11:50] drunken are drunken in the night he said
[1:11:52] but let us who are of the day how many
[1:11:54] are of the the day this evening I'm of
[1:11:57] the day it may be just a little bit but
[1:11:59] it's it's a light around me it may seem
[1:12:00] like Darkness all around me but there's
[1:12:02] light I'm of the
[1:12:03] day let let us who are of the day be
[1:12:06] sober again there's that word to to make
[1:12:08] sure that our minds are are not overcome
[1:12:12] by all these things that are going on he
[1:12:14] said putting on the breastplate of faith
[1:12:16] and love and for a helmet the hope of
[1:12:21] salvation for a helmet where does the
[1:12:24] helmet go on the head now look at this
[1:12:28] word sober again to be sober to be calm
[1:12:30] and Collective to be temperate
[1:12:32] dispassionate circumspect not to be
[1:12:34] overcome by
[1:12:35] emotion that's what it means 1
[1:12:37] Thessalonians 5:9 for God ha not
[1:12:39] appointed us to wrath but to obtain
[1:12:42] salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:12:45] aren't you glad for that who died for us
[1:12:48] whether we wake or sleep we should live
[1:12:51] together with him he said wherefore
[1:12:53] Comfort yourselves to together and edify
[1:12:56] one another even as also you do now so
[1:12:59] Paul is saying put on the hope of
[1:13:02] Salvation as a helmet so you can
[1:13:04] maintain your sobriety in a world that's
[1:13:07] drunk with ignorance and Insanity
[1:13:10] maintain that ability to to understand
[1:13:13] where you
[1:13:14] are and what hour you live in he said
[1:13:18] wherefore Comfort yourselves together
[1:13:20] edify one another even as also you do
[1:13:23] Ephesians 6:17
[1:13:26] he speaks of it again he said take the
[1:13:27] helmet of salvation the helmet of
[1:13:29] salvation the sword of the spirit which
[1:13:31] is the word of God so the helmet of
[1:13:33] salvation is the hope of
[1:13:35] Salvation now brother Bram says that's
[1:13:38] he said he says the soul then he says
[1:13:40] the mind he said the mind in here the
[1:13:43] head covers the
[1:13:46] head covers the head he said how you
[1:13:49] going to let this helmet what's what it
[1:13:51] does he said it's a protection
[1:13:55] it's a
[1:13:56] protection what is a helmet made out of
[1:14:00] brass take a brass helmet and try to
[1:14:03] punch
[1:14:04] it you're going to
[1:14:06] hurt right man out of brass it's
[1:14:10] hard tempered he said harder than iron a
[1:14:13] brass headpiece what salvation knowledge
[1:14:17] what was Paul talking about the hope of
[1:14:19] Salvation Being Sober he says put on the
[1:14:23] the hope of Salvation as a helmet here
[1:14:25] he says brass can be tempered uh he said
[1:14:28] a brass headpiece is the Salvation
[1:14:29] knowledge of knowing this my healing
[1:14:32] comes from God my salvation comes from
[1:14:37] God Amen my experience matches his
[1:14:41] word you see why it's so important that
[1:14:44] we teach a word that's sober and that's
[1:14:46] sane we we start teaching that it's
[1:14:48] tongues it's evidence or or you have to
[1:14:50] jump and you have to shout and you have
[1:14:51] to run all over the church what that
[1:14:54] does is it makes people where they don't
[1:14:56] keep sober as to what their experience
[1:14:58] whether it matches the
[1:14:59] word that's right we our experience has
[1:15:02] to match the word there's nothing wrong
[1:15:04] with those things but our experience is
[1:15:06] not based in those things my experience
[1:15:09] matches the word and and that hope of
[1:15:11] Salvation that I have that helmet that
[1:15:13] I've got on that expectation of
[1:15:15] Salvation keeps me oh my from allowing
[1:15:19] the Devil to talk me out of who I
[1:15:23] am right CU I know this my healing comes
[1:15:27] from God my salvation comes from God my
[1:15:30] experience matches his word not the
[1:15:33] church's idea the word there you are
[1:15:36] covered over with a protection the
[1:15:38] helmet of salvation Deliverance take
[1:15:41] that then go marching forward oh church
[1:15:45] we we need that helmet of salvation
[1:15:47] today we need that more than in any
[1:15:49] other hours as the devil is just pouring
[1:15:52] things on you and he'll try to make you
[1:15:53] think well everything is going to pieces
[1:15:55] and the church is not what it should be
[1:15:57] and the message is not what it should be
[1:15:59] and the devil will attack you by
[1:16:00] websites and he'll attack you by
[1:16:02] preachers and he'll attack you by people
[1:16:04] and just over just a constant Onslaught
[1:16:06] even he'll use your own family against
[1:16:08] you but you get up in the morning you
[1:16:10] put on that helmet of the hope of
[1:16:12] Salvation you begin to walk out in it
[1:16:13] and you begin to realize my healing
[1:16:16] comes from God my salvation comes from
[1:16:18] God I I match my experience in the
[1:16:22] Bible it don't matter what they say I've
[1:16:24] got my helmet on I expect to be
[1:16:26] delivered I expect if the Rapture comes
[1:16:29] today I'm going my body is going to be
[1:16:31] changed I expect that God will do things
[1:16:33] for me I believe that he'll heal me I
[1:16:36] believe he'll save my children I believe
[1:16:38] I have an expectation of
[1:16:41] Salvation amen and that protects me from
[1:16:45] everything that would come through my
[1:16:47] mind in the world that we live
[1:16:50] in take that and then go marching
[1:16:52] forward so the Roman helmet you could
[1:16:55] see was a protection it covered over it
[1:16:57] might have been heavy to wear might have
[1:16:59] been hard I wouldn't have wanted to try
[1:17:01] to wear a hat like that that's made out
[1:17:02] of
[1:17:03] brass it might have made your hair look
[1:17:08] weird might have made you
[1:17:10] sweat but it was
[1:17:13] protection it was protection might look
[1:17:15] funny to the world but they had been
[1:17:17] through the battle and they knew what it
[1:17:20] took amen what brought Jesus up out of
[1:17:24] the Grave it was the expectation of
[1:17:25] God's word he believed God's word and it
[1:17:29] brought him he believed his own word and
[1:17:30] it brought him up out of the Grave the
[1:17:32] hope of Salvation the expectation that
[1:17:34] God would would would uh do what he said
[1:17:37] he would do that's what the Jews are
[1:17:39] still holding on to today and one day
[1:17:41] that faith for 144,000 Jews will be
[1:17:44] rewarded why because they have a hope
[1:17:46] and expectation of
[1:17:48] Salvation and so the Romans could put
[1:17:50] this on and they could walk around and
[1:17:52] they weren't afraid because they had an
[1:17:55] expectation the helmet was good it was
[1:17:58] the best in the world it would keep them
[1:18:01] from
[1:18:02] danger how much more should we have an
[1:18:04] expectation in the of
[1:18:06] Salvation that our God keeps his
[1:18:09] word brother Brandman and knoweth it not
[1:18:13] he said brother George Wright sitting
[1:18:14] here is 75 or 78 years old he said what
[1:18:17] would you think would have happened if
[1:18:18] You' have went to seen sister Wright
[1:18:20] someday and you would have been standing
[1:18:21] in a pair of
[1:18:22] shorts he said why you never you'd had
[1:18:25] the woman locked up you'd have never
[1:18:27] married
[1:18:29] her well if any young man in that day
[1:18:31] would have done it the same thing would
[1:18:32] have took place listen Brothers we need
[1:18:34] to appreciate our
[1:18:36] wives because our wives go out on a
[1:18:39] world full of women that they don't look
[1:18:42] like and they're doing that for
[1:18:45] us and for God but they're doing that
[1:18:48] for us when it comes to our wives we
[1:18:50] don't have to worry about them going out
[1:18:52] in the world and somebody lusting after
[1:18:54] them because of the way they're dressed
[1:18:56] because of the way they look are you
[1:18:58] with me some people are will will lust
[1:19:01] after anything but you understand
[1:19:03] they've kept themselves we ought to
[1:19:06] appreciate that very much instead of
[1:19:09] pushing them off and thinking I see
[1:19:10] young people today go out in the world
[1:19:12] and try to find some girl that dresses
[1:19:14] just as awful as she can look because
[1:19:15] it's so different from what they're used
[1:19:17] to around the church but you find out
[1:19:19] once you're married for a while you
[1:19:20] appreciate a woman that keeps herself
[1:19:21] right keeps herself holy you don't want
[1:19:24] what the world world has somebody
[1:19:26] that'll hold back and not not show that
[1:19:28] to everybody
[1:19:30] else are you with me now he said if a
[1:19:33] young man in that day would have done it
[1:19:35] he said he said you'd have never married
[1:19:36] her he saidy young man in that day would
[1:19:38] have done it the same thing would have
[1:19:39] took place she'd be a dishonorable woman
[1:19:41] to present herself like that he said
[1:19:43] well it was sin if it was sin and wrong
[1:19:45] then it's the same thing but the people
[1:19:47] has grow into
[1:19:53] Insanity these and you know you've heard
[1:19:56] me enough now I'm not
[1:19:57] a a preacher that just constantly talks
[1:20:01] about specific things but just bear with
[1:20:03] me for a moment these yoga pants women
[1:20:06] wear today that's
[1:20:10] insanity and you have to Shield your
[1:20:12] eyes just think my she forgot to put
[1:20:14] pants on forgot to put a skirt on
[1:20:16] something you
[1:20:18] know why would why would anybody and
[1:20:20] then you look at the schools and I watch
[1:20:23] the schools with my kids and
[1:20:25] and the kids don't want to dress that
[1:20:27] way they want to dress like my girls
[1:20:30] they do they go up to my girls they want
[1:20:31] to they want to put on a dress they like
[1:20:32] to look nice and the parents buy these
[1:20:35] clothes for them it's awful and then of
[1:20:38] course after the kids get older they
[1:20:39] realize boys look at
[1:20:40] them huh but I found even my girls you
[1:20:43] got to beat the the boys away with the
[1:20:45] stick you know not only because they're
[1:20:47] pretty because they look like they're
[1:20:48] Daddy no they look like their mother
[1:20:52] just thought I'd threw that throw that
[1:20:53] in for a bit of humor but
[1:20:55] but they're pretty but that's not it
[1:20:56] they're
[1:20:57] different and and and the boys even in
[1:20:59] the school will will look at that and
[1:21:01] and there's something about that that's
[1:21:03] just different but you see what we're
[1:21:05] doing it's Insanity people grow into
[1:21:08] that like the frog that got put in a
[1:21:11] bowl of warm water just kept turning up
[1:21:13] the heat and after a while if a woman
[1:21:16] can do whatever she wants to do and if a
[1:21:18] man says anything about it not that the
[1:21:19] man the man has no right to do anything
[1:21:21] but if he would it's completely his
[1:21:24] fault
[1:21:26] and she has nothing to do in it what is
[1:21:28] it it's grown into
[1:21:33] Insanity what what do we need we need
[1:21:34] the helmet of
[1:21:37] salvation to keep us from becoming that
[1:21:40] Brothers as you go out in the world you
[1:21:42] need the helmet of salvation to keep you
[1:21:44] from looking at
[1:21:48] that if it was sin then and wrong then
[1:21:50] it's the same thing if adultery was
[1:21:53] wrong yesterday it's wrong today today
[1:21:55] if ungodliness was wrong yesterday it's
[1:21:57] wrong today we don't grow into something
[1:21:59] that's outside of the word if what we're
[1:22:02] doing is wrong and we know what it is if
[1:22:04] what we're doing is wrong let's just
[1:22:05] stop doing it do what's right the world
[1:22:08] may have grown into insanity but we have
[1:22:10] a clear
[1:22:11] picture amen by the word of
[1:22:16] God I don't know where that come from
[1:22:18] that wasn't in my notes that's
[1:22:21] free Lord help me
[1:22:24] August 15th 1965 brother Brandon
[1:22:27] preaches he said let me prophesy
[1:22:28] something to you just before it comes to
[1:22:32] pass the whole world is grouping in
[1:22:35] insanity and I wouldn't look that up
[1:22:37] because I thought brother BR said
[1:22:38] groping in Insanity he actually says
[1:22:40] grouping in
[1:22:41] Insanity grouping in
[1:22:44] insanity and it seems like when they
[1:22:46] come in groups they get
[1:22:50] worse as the mob grows bigger and you
[1:22:53] can look and if you've looked at what's
[1:22:55] happened over the last couple of weeks
[1:22:56] it's like a a microcosm it's like a a
[1:22:59] microscope on what's going on in the
[1:23:02] world that people are just grouping
[1:23:04] together in
[1:23:05] lawlessness where no law applies no no
[1:23:09] whatever every man does what's right in
[1:23:11] his own
[1:23:12] eyes and so the people go into bondage
[1:23:14] because without any law everybody's a
[1:23:18] slave right and it applies in the
[1:23:20] natural and the spiritual so there has
[1:23:22] to be something you believe in something
[1:23:24] is true the whole world is grouping in
[1:23:27] insanity and how do they do it today by
[1:23:30] Facebook I'm not against Facebook but
[1:23:32] I'm saying that's how they do it they do
[1:23:35] it by by Twitter they do it by Insanity
[1:23:38] until the police even know when there's
[1:23:40] about to be something take place because
[1:23:43] there are people online who never get
[1:23:44] out of their parents' basement who are
[1:23:48] actually causing these riots and Things
[1:23:50] by stirring up the people and these
[1:23:52] people get out on the streets and get
[1:23:54] arrested and I heard the governor of
[1:23:55] Arkansas say today the people who are
[1:23:57] instigating it never somehow never get
[1:24:00] arrested but it's so they cover their
[1:24:02] tracks but it's the ones who get out
[1:24:04] there on the front line they get
[1:24:05] arrested not even knowing why they're
[1:24:07] mad don't even know why they're stirred
[1:24:09] up they just get stirred up because
[1:24:11] they're grouping in
[1:24:12] Insanity they just come together and the
[1:24:14] more the more insane people you get
[1:24:17] around the less insane you feel the more
[1:24:20] righteous you feel like your cause is
[1:24:23] the whole world is grouping in Insanity
[1:24:24] will get worse and worse and worse until
[1:24:28] there'll be a bunch of maniacs and it's
[1:24:30] almost that way now he said look what
[1:24:34] Darkness we're in today look what's
[1:24:36] going on today look at murder rape
[1:24:38] Strife he said why it's come to pass I
[1:24:40] believe it was Billy Graham said in 10
[1:24:42] years from now every citizen of
[1:24:44] California will have to pack a gun to
[1:24:45] protect himself where are we at
[1:24:47] today he said you can't put enough law
[1:24:50] enforcement the people have just gone
[1:24:51] insane shooting murder rapes everything
[1:24:54] see it's gone wild upon the streets see
[1:24:57] it's a day we're living in a sodomite
[1:24:59] day until you look at the our even our
[1:25:02] own monuments in Washington and I saw a
[1:25:04] picture of the of the Lincoln Memorial
[1:25:08] with every step lined with soldiers
[1:25:11] because it took that many people with
[1:25:13] automatic machine guns to keep people
[1:25:15] from defacing the greatest Monument to
[1:25:18] Freedom we have probably in this
[1:25:20] country what's going
[1:25:23] on if they if they hadn't been there
[1:25:25] they would have defaced the Monument of
[1:25:28] the man who gave his life to free the
[1:25:32] slaves it makes no
[1:25:34] sense I'm so glad we're not in the
[1:25:38] darkness amen you see the world how it's
[1:25:41] been how it is he says it's gone wild
[1:25:43] since today we're living in a sodomite
[1:25:44] day but there is a light shining oh I'm
[1:25:48] so grateful for that great Shining Light
[1:25:49] today there is a light shining he said
[1:25:52] if they'd only look if they'd only see
[1:25:54] look into the word and see what's
[1:25:55] supposed to be in this hour they would
[1:25:57] know what's trying to be
[1:26:00] done for God ha not given us the spirit
[1:26:03] of fear the Bible says but of power and
[1:26:05] of love and of a sound mind God has not
[1:26:08] given us the spirit of fear the world is
[1:26:11] full of it but he's not given it to us
[1:26:14] but he's given us power he's given us
[1:26:15] love he's given us a sound mind a sober
[1:26:18] mind Children of the day
[1:26:24] brother brand I'm again I'm sorry for
[1:26:26] keeping you but as long as I have but
[1:26:27] it'll just be a minute a couple minutes
[1:26:30] longer a couple is variable
[1:26:34] but I try to get myself a little room
[1:26:36] and not lie to you I'm
[1:26:38] sorry I want to get try to get through
[1:26:40] this
[1:26:41] tonight he said watch them when they
[1:26:43] come to the other country speaking of
[1:26:45] Americans it makes you sick to even
[1:26:47] think you're America the way they act
[1:26:50] it's rightest the nastiest acting people
[1:26:51] the most impudent impudent independ
[1:26:54] dependent educated
[1:27:00] idiots what would he think
[1:27:02] today he said and the other world knows
[1:27:05] it said no wonder we're trying to buy
[1:27:07] our friendship with our dollars they
[1:27:09] look at third world countries I've been
[1:27:10] in third world countries those people
[1:27:12] have so much more respect for themselves
[1:27:14] and for their neighbors than we
[1:27:17] do I say we as a
[1:27:20] nation the other world knows it he said
[1:27:23] no wonder we're trying to buy our
[1:27:24] friendship with our dollars you don't
[1:27:25] buy friendship he said our nation is
[1:27:27] rotten to the roots there's no hope for
[1:27:30] it it's all gone there's only one thing
[1:27:32] to look for the coming of the
[1:27:35] Lord oh my you see our hope of Salvation
[1:27:39] gives us the ability to keep pressing on
[1:27:42] listen it's in this hour and it may seem
[1:27:45] like an oxymoron as I'm closing tonight
[1:27:47] but it may seem like a strange thing
[1:27:48] it's in this hour that we invest in our
[1:27:51] local
[1:27:52] church it's in when the dark dark Ness
[1:27:54] is the hardest that's when we put in the
[1:27:56] time that's needed it's when the
[1:27:58] darkness is is the is the worst that's
[1:28:01] when we pray more that's when we seek
[1:28:03] God more that's when the Bible said we
[1:28:05] should assemble together more as we see
[1:28:07] the day approaching why because the
[1:28:10] darkness is all around us the darkness
[1:28:13] is so powerful but light is always more
[1:28:16] powerful than
[1:28:17] Darkness so we build we plant we do the
[1:28:20] things that we have to do to keep the
[1:28:22] kingdom of God going because because we
[1:28:24] have
[1:28:26] hope it may look like they say well why
[1:28:29] do you do the things that you do why do
[1:28:30] you want to why do you want to keep
[1:28:32] things going why do you want to keep
[1:28:33] things looking as nice as possible and
[1:28:35] and keep people and keep witnessing and
[1:28:37] keep if it the Lord's coming anyhow I
[1:28:39] read a story of a of a town in Maine
[1:28:42] where they gave the people about six
[1:28:44] months warning that they were going to
[1:28:47] flood the place and this Village or town
[1:28:49] would be completely washed over in water
[1:28:52] so they gave the people 6 months warning
[1:28:53] to get out out guess what happened not a
[1:28:57] yard got
[1:28:57] mowed not a house got painted and they
[1:29:01] said walking into that town just before
[1:29:03] the water was about to fall it looked
[1:29:05] like it was just a ghost
[1:29:07] town why because they were
[1:29:10] hopeless they were hopeless they gave up
[1:29:14] oh
[1:29:15] church and know if we're not careful the
[1:29:17] devil get us in that position where we
[1:29:19] feel like we're
[1:29:20] hopeless well the Lord's coming anyway
[1:29:23] might as well just eat drink could be
[1:29:24] married there it's not things haven't
[1:29:26] worked out like we thought they would we
[1:29:27] might as well just pull off to ourselves
[1:29:29] no we keep building we keep investing we
[1:29:32] keep working we keep shouting we keep
[1:29:33] praising we keep witnessing we keep
[1:29:35] reaching out why because the world is
[1:29:38] falling apart but we're
[1:29:43] not we don't invest in our church or
[1:29:46] invest in our
[1:29:48] families because we don't believe the
[1:29:50] Lord is
[1:29:51] coming I believe a man if he if he
[1:29:53] doesn't doesn't have an education like
[1:29:55] he should and he sees a way to better
[1:29:56] himself do that if you can and still
[1:29:58] serve the Lord like you
[1:29:59] should if you don't have a good job and
[1:30:01] you want to try to train do something to
[1:30:03] get a better job do that if you
[1:30:05] can if if something needs painted paint
[1:30:07] it if a house needs build buil build
[1:30:12] it why because not because you don't
[1:30:15] believe the Lord is coming but because
[1:30:16] you believe he
[1:30:21] is I'm going to be all the light I can
[1:30:23] be while I'm
[1:30:25] here so it puts even more urgency in
[1:30:28] what we
[1:30:29] do not because of hopelessness but
[1:30:32] because of
[1:30:34] Hope the hope that I have for the future
[1:30:36] gives me hope for today see Jesus said
[1:30:39] this Jesus knowing that he was going to
[1:30:41] die yet all the way to the Cross he does
[1:30:46] good
[1:30:47] things he he does good for people he
[1:30:50] heals the blind eyes and makes the lame
[1:30:52] walk and raises the Dead all the way to
[1:30:56] his own
[1:30:58] cross knowing what was going to happen
[1:31:00] but what does he say he says I must work
[1:31:02] the works of him that sent me while it
[1:31:04] is day the night cometh when no man can
[1:31:08] work said now's not the time to when
[1:31:11] when things are dark and it don't seem
[1:31:12] like there's many folks around now's not
[1:31:13] the time to to do and to work and to
[1:31:16] really put your heart into it no now is
[1:31:18] the time to do that if there ever was a
[1:31:21] time to work Now's the Time
[1:31:24] H the devil's working over time because
[1:31:26] he knows his end is short he hasn't
[1:31:29] given up he still shows up at church I
[1:31:32] heard brother Andrew Glover preaching
[1:31:33] the other day and he talked about how
[1:31:34] the devil is still always the most
[1:31:35] faithful one to be there but why why is
[1:31:38] he always there because he hasn't given
[1:31:40] up he's still trying to do all he can do
[1:31:42] knowing he has an end out there he knows
[1:31:44] that it's true he knows God is real he's
[1:31:46] been right there before the throne he
[1:31:49] knows God is real but he keeps going
[1:31:51] anyway we know God is real and we keep
[1:31:53] going anyway we know the coming of the
[1:31:55] Lord is near but we keep walking he said
[1:31:57] see then that you walk circumspectly in
[1:31:59] Ephesians 5:15 circumspectly that's that
[1:32:02] word soberly with with the right kind of
[1:32:04] mind think what about what you do walk
[1:32:07] circumspectly not as fools but as wise
[1:32:10] Redeeming the time Redeeming the time
[1:32:13] because the days are
[1:32:14] evil brother BR says if you're building
[1:32:16] a house put it on up Jesus comes
[1:32:18] tomorrow you'll be found faithful it's
[1:32:20] your duty if you're Building a Church go
[1:32:22] on put it up I'd rather be putting my
[1:32:24] money in something like that that'd be
[1:32:25] found with it in my pocket we're not
[1:32:27] building a new building that's not why
[1:32:29] I'm saying that I'm not about to Spring
[1:32:31] something on you but we got to keep our
[1:32:35] hope keep pressing on how do we increase
[1:32:38] that Romans 5 and3 we have hope through
[1:32:41] experience not only so he said but we
[1:32:42] glory and tribulations also knowing that
[1:32:45] tribulation worketh patience patience
[1:32:47] experience and experience hope we have
[1:32:51] hopec we have the hope of Salvation
[1:32:52] because we've experienced
[1:32:56] salvation and hope maketh not ashamed
[1:32:58] because the love of God is shed abroad
[1:32:59] in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is
[1:33:00] given unto us we also find Hope in the
[1:33:04] scriptures Romans 15:4 for whatsoever
[1:33:06] things were written a four time were
[1:33:08] written for our learning that we through
[1:33:10] patience and comfort of the scriptures
[1:33:13] might have hope have hope by the Holy
[1:33:15] Ghost Romans chapter 15 and 13 now the
[1:33:18] god of Hope fill you with all joy and
[1:33:20] peace in believing that you may abound
[1:33:22] in Hope through the power of the Holy
[1:33:26] Ghost amen nothing gives you hope like
[1:33:28] seeing the Holy Ghost work in your
[1:33:33] life Psalms 13 and5 says this musicians
[1:33:36] go ahead and come he said I wait for the
[1:33:40] Lord my soul doth wait and in his
[1:33:44] word do I
[1:33:49] hope there's a
[1:33:51] story of the school system in a large
[1:33:55] city that had a program to help children
[1:33:58] keep up with their schoolwork during
[1:34:00] stays in the City
[1:34:01] Hospital one day a teacher was assigned
[1:34:04] who was assigned to the program received
[1:34:06] a routine call asking her to visit a
[1:34:08] particular child she took the child's
[1:34:10] name and room number talked with the
[1:34:13] child's class teacher and the teacher
[1:34:15] told her said we're studying nouns and
[1:34:17] adverbs now and that's what he's missing
[1:34:20] so why don't you go and and teach him
[1:34:22] about nouns and adver
[1:34:25] verbs no one had mentioned to the
[1:34:27] hospital program teacher that the boy
[1:34:29] had been badly burned and was in great
[1:34:32] pain he was she was upset when she saw
[1:34:36] him when she left she felt she hadn't
[1:34:39] accomplished much just teaching a dying
[1:34:42] boy about nouns and adverbs seems like a
[1:34:46] strange thing to
[1:34:48] do the next day as she was making rounds
[1:34:51] in the hospital a nurse come to her and
[1:34:53] said what did you do to that
[1:34:55] boy and she thought she must have done
[1:34:57] something she needed to apologize for
[1:34:58] and she the nurse said no you don't know
[1:35:01] what I mean we've been worried about
[1:35:02] that little boy because he had no hope
[1:35:05] but ever since yesterday his whole
[1:35:06] attitude has changed he's fighting back
[1:35:09] responding to treatment it's almost like
[1:35:11] he's decided to
[1:35:15] live the boy explained later that he had
[1:35:17] given up
[1:35:19] hope until the teacher arrived and as
[1:35:22] she sat there and began to teach him
[1:35:23] brother his it's nouns and
[1:35:26] adverbs what a strange thing to give
[1:35:28] hope nouns and
[1:35:30] adverbs but heut he said it this way he
[1:35:32] said they wouldn't send a teacher to
[1:35:35] teach me nouns and adverbs if I was a
[1:35:37] dying
[1:35:40] boy
[1:35:41] amen oh my don't you real don't you
[1:35:44] recognize don't you realize the reason
[1:35:46] why God keeps talking to us keeps
[1:35:48] preaching to us keeps talking to us
[1:35:49] through the tapes keeps talking to us
[1:35:51] through Ministry keeps preaching to
[1:35:53] keeps speaking speak to us through the
[1:35:54] music that we hear why does he keep
[1:35:55] speaking every day in our lives because
[1:35:57] he wouldn't be teaching us about our
[1:35:59] nouns and adverbs he wouldn't be
[1:36:00] teaching us our ABCs if there was no
[1:36:03] hope there is hope because he's
[1:36:06] preparing us for a better
[1:36:08] place amen amen let's stand together
[1:36:12] don't you love the
[1:36:13] Lord amen I pray the Lord will just give
[1:36:17] you
[1:36:18] hope hope for the Future Hope for the
[1:36:21] future don't give up no matter what what
[1:36:24] happens don't give up there's always
[1:36:27] hope because our specific hope is that
[1:36:31] we're going to live
[1:36:33] forever amen that gives hope to every
[1:36:37] other are area of our life Heavenly
[1:36:39] Father Lord Jesus we thank you for all
[1:36:43] that you've done for us today and Lord
[1:36:46] in my own rushed way but Lord I I know
[1:36:49] that you still spoke to your people
[1:36:51] tonight and you spoke to my heart
[1:36:53] through these things help us to never
[1:36:56] give up
[1:36:57] hope there's never a
[1:36:59] situation Lord that I found that maybe
[1:37:03] I've been in situations where people
[1:37:04] were angry I've never found a situation
[1:37:07] where if I could get them to talk to one
[1:37:08] another if I could get them to sit down
[1:37:10] at the table and have lunch together and
[1:37:13] work together eventually they just
[1:37:16] couldn't hold that level of
[1:37:18] anger and I realize Lord that it's just
[1:37:21] because they found Hope as they to begin
[1:37:23] to work together I pray it would be so
[1:37:25] with
[1:37:26] us Lord that we would find Hope in our
[1:37:28] lives as we work together Lord as we
[1:37:32] move towards the Future No Matter what's
[1:37:35] happened in the past there is no
[1:37:36] situation that's so far gone that if
[1:37:39] we'll just sit down and talk to you
[1:37:41] about it Lord everything will be okay I
[1:37:45] pray you'd Grant it Lord Lord help us to
[1:37:48] just worship you when we come to the

[1:37:56] honor that you

[1:38:04] everything just walk with
[1:38:06] you father I pray that you'd help us to

[1:38:12] reality when our lives seem like

[1:38:16] know that you're still with us as long
[1:38:19] as we believe father we we don't our
[1:38:22] hope is not in people Our Hope is not in
[1:38:24] circumstances not even in churches or in
[1:38:27] Preachers Our Hope Lord is not in any
[1:38:30] man but our hope our great hope that was
