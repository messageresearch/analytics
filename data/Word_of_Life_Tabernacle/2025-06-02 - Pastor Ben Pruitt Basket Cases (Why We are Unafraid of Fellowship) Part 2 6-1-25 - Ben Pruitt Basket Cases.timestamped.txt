[35:38] me. He has forgiven me. Aren't you glad
[35:41] to be forgiven tonight? Amen. I hope you
[35:43] didn't mind me trying out some new songs
[35:45] on you. And uh you know, I'd rather you
[35:48] clap than not clapped at all. Even if
[35:49] you clap
[35:51] off because one thing we do, we want to
[35:54] praise the Lord. And we want him to be
[35:56] pleased with our worship because you're
[35:57] not worshiping one another. I like it to
[35:59] sound good, but ultimately we want to
[36:01] give our praise to the Lord, don't we?
[36:02] And so tonight, I want to say just let
[36:04] us let us just praise him with all we've
[36:06] got. Amen. I wonder if we can stand
[36:08] together. We're going to go ahead and
[36:09] invite our pastor out. Just keep him in
[36:11] prayer if you would. He just the devil's
[36:13] been attacking him, trying to make him
[36:16] sick and body. Amen. But I believe that
[36:18] the Lord could heal him as well while he
[36:20] preaches the word to you tonight. Amen.
[36:22] If you have a need on your heart, just
[36:23] hold it before the Lord. Amen. as as the
[36:26] as the word goes forth. And I believe he
[36:30] will I believe he will meet every need
[36:31] tonight. You believe it? Amen. I believe
[36:33] we come to communion tonight and we can
[36:36] sing this with all of our hearts that he
[36:37] has forgiven me. Amen. My sins have been
[36:40] washed from his memory. Aren't you
[36:42] thankful for it? Can you give the Lord
[36:43] another hand clap of praise tonight?
[36:47] He
[36:49] has
[36:51] forgiven me. Oh my sins have been
[36:56] washed from his
[37:00] memory by the blood of the

[38:02] by the blood of the
[38:05] lamb of
[38:08] Calary. I know
[38:11] he
[38:13] has
[38:15] for me. We bow our heads together.
[38:19] Heavenly Father, as we come to Lord,
[38:22] this service, this special service that
[38:24] we have that we call our communion
[38:26] service, I pray God that you'd help us
[38:29] to take it, Lord, not as not as a a role
[38:34] or just something we do, a form, Lord.
[38:37] May it be a reality in our lives, Lord,
[38:39] that you have chosen us and chose to die
[38:42] for us. So thankful for that, Lord.
[38:46] What greater friend could a man have
[38:47] than one who will die for his friend?
[38:50] I'm thankful for that today. I ask you
[38:53] to come into this service and just speak
[38:55] directly to to all of us, to me, Lord.
[38:58] Lord, as we address some of these
[39:00] things, continue from this morning's
[39:02] service and then go into communion
[39:03] service. May your presence never leave
[39:05] us. May we just always stay right with
[39:08] your word, right with what you want us
[39:09] to say. For you grant it, Lord, in Jesus
[39:13] name. Amen.
[39:17] Amen.
[39:19] Hallelujah. Bless you tonight. If you'll
[39:21] turn to Mark chapter 4 and verse 21.
[39:23] Mark
[39:27] 4:21. I'll try to keep this about 30
[39:30] minutes tonight and we'll go right into
[39:33] communion
[39:37] service. Mark
[39:40] 4 21.
[39:44] this there couldn't have been anything
[39:45] more fitting I don't think than me
[39:47] having to struggle through these
[39:48] services today after having been here
[39:50] five years because that's the kind of
[39:52] you know I guess that's what God has
[39:53] called us to but you know what there's
[39:55] victory on the other side and anytime
[39:57] you see a struggle see also a victory
[40:01] and so we want to make sure that we
[40:04] don't just focus on the struggle but we
[40:05] focus on the fact hey we made it through
[40:08] right and and there's a blessing in that
[40:10] even when you come to church I know some
[40:11] of you don't feel like being here
[40:12] tonight but you're here and you don't
[40:14] focus on the struggle of being here, but
[40:16] you focus on the victory fact that you
[40:18] made it. I appreciate that tonight. Mark
[40:20] 4:21, you said unto them, is a candle
[40:23] brought to be put under a bushel or
[40:24] under a bed and not to be set on a
[40:26] candlestick. For there is nothing hid
[40:29] which shall not be manifested. Neither
[40:31] was anything kept secret, but that it
[40:34] should come abroad. If any man have ears
[40:36] to hear, let him hear. Pray the Lord
[40:39] would add his blessing to the word. You
[40:40] may be seated. We talk about basket
[40:43] cases, why we
[40:46] fellowship, but we're not afraid. We're
[40:48] unafraid to
[40:49] fellowship. We're looking at how Paul
[40:51] established fellowship and how he
[40:52] treated different kinds of folks and how
[40:55] brother Brandham followed that pattern.
[40:57] We know there's different uh there's
[40:59] different people in our lives that we
[41:00] treat differently based on who they are.
[41:02] That's not wrong. We have families.
[41:04] We're going to protect our own families.
[41:05] We're going to uh make sure that we love
[41:07] them, take care of them, and and uh and
[41:10] help them any way that we can. There's
[41:11] nothing wrong with that. We're all the
[41:13] family of God, right? He has a right to
[41:16] have a family just like we have a right
[41:17] to have a family. I'm so thankful for
[41:19] that. And so, he he helps us and
[41:22] protects us. And so, but he there was a
[41:25] certain pattern to how Paul treated
[41:28] different kinds of people, people that
[41:30] he come across and and also how brother
[41:32] Brandham, the message of our age,
[41:33] followed that pattern. And so, brother
[41:36] Brandham tells us this about Paul, his
[41:38] manner of ministering, I want you to
[41:40] notice that his manner of ministering
[41:41] set the pattern that all future
[41:44] messengers were to aspire to. And I
[41:45] don't think that means Paul's hand
[41:47] gestures in the pulpit or something like
[41:49] that because we don't know what that
[41:50] was. We don't know if he was loud or if
[41:52] he was quiet. We don't know. I tend to
[41:55] think he may have been loud just because
[41:56] he uh well, we know he did put a person
[41:58] to sleep one time, but he preached all
[42:00] night,
[42:02] but I tend to think he was loud just by
[42:04] nature that he he was just such a
[42:06] passionate writer and you kind of could
[42:07] see that coming across. He might have
[42:09] been a loud preacher, but yet we that's
[42:11] not what the pattern that we're
[42:12] following. We're patterning patterning
[42:14] after the things that he did and how he
[42:16] approached ministry. So he said all
[42:19] future messengers were to aspire to and
[42:20] actually sets the pattern for every true
[42:22] minister of God. Oh he would not attain
[42:25] to such heights in the prophetic realm
[42:26] as did Paul. Again he said uh he said
[42:30] there were three things that Paul that
[42:32] Paul did. He said first of all Paul was
[42:34] absolutely true to the word. He never
[42:36] deviated from it no matter what the
[42:37] cost. Well I hope that can be said about
[42:40] me. I want that to be said about me when
[42:42] I when I my work is done here on the
[42:45] earth that I was absolutely never
[42:46] deviated from the word no matter what
[42:48] the cost. Secondly, his ministry was in
[42:50] the power of the spirit thereby
[42:52] demonstrating the spoken and written
[42:53] word. So it wasn't just letter only but
[42:55] it was in the power of the spirit. And
[42:57] thirdly, he had the evident fruit of his
[42:59] god-given ministry. So the people that
[43:01] he preached to was the fruit of his
[43:03] ministry. So Paul did things a certain
[43:05] way. And you think about the the church,
[43:07] there was no gentile church when Paul
[43:09] started. By the time Paul gets his head
[43:12] chopped off, to put it bluntly, that
[43:14] they had spread all over the world. And
[43:17] how did that happen? Well, that manner
[43:19] of ministering caused that to happen. He
[43:21] had fruit of how he ministered, how he
[43:23] treated people, how he did the things
[43:24] that he did. So he says this to the
[43:27] Corinthians, "If I be not an apostle
[43:28] unto others, yet doubtless I am to you.
[43:31] And for the seal of mine apostilhip are
[43:33] you in the Lord." So other words, you're
[43:34] the results of my ministry. I think
[43:35] every one of us could say we're the
[43:36] results of uh Brother Brandham's
[43:38] ministry in our day. I I think we could
[43:40] all agree to that. That's why I'm here
[43:42] preaching to you. We would have never
[43:44] known each other if it hadn't been for
[43:45] the message of the hour. But everything
[43:48] we do has a it has an effect and and it
[43:51] has an effect and we have to think in
[43:52] the long term five years down the road,
[43:54] 10 years down the road, 15 years down
[43:57] the road that the Lord carries and see
[43:59] what our effect of our manner of
[44:00] ministering is. look at the fruit of it
[44:02] and see whether it's good or whether
[44:04] it's bad. So the Corinthians were a mess
[44:07] as we said this morning, but Paul didn't
[44:08] cast them aside. He worked with them. He
[44:11] worked with them. Aren't you glad God
[44:13] works with you? Though we're a mess
[44:15] sometimes, but God works with us. And so
[44:19] you find brother Brandham, he
[44:21] illustrates this with actually with
[44:23] Jesus when he went to Simon's house. You
[44:25] remember Jesus went to Simon's house
[44:27] knowing that they invited him to come
[44:29] for the wrong reason. Right? He knew
[44:32] that they invited him to come for the
[44:33] wrong reasons. They were they were
[44:34] bringing him in to make sport of him, to
[44:37] make fun of him. But Jesus wasn't going
[44:39] to be made fun of. He was going to meet
[44:42] somebody,
[44:43] right? He was Hallelujah. He was going
[44:45] I'm so glad he come down in my situation
[44:47] and met me. He was going to meet
[44:50] somebody. And and Simon and Jesus,
[44:52] brother Random illustrates that. They
[44:54] were not birds of a feather. They they
[44:55] had nothing in common. So he said it was
[44:57] odd for him to invite him. There must be
[44:59] an ulterior motive. Yeah. And but he was
[45:02] there for an ill-famed woman. He wasn't
[45:04] there for Simon. In fact, the worst
[45:06] sinner in the city, brother preaches on
[45:07] that. The worst sinner in the city
[45:09] wasn't the woman. It was the Pharisee.
[45:12] But he was there for the woman whose
[45:14] sins would be forgiven. He said, "And
[45:16] this story will be told as a testimony."
[45:18] Yeah. So, I want us to think about the
[45:21] future and think about what happens
[45:23] because we come to, you know, we've been
[45:24] here five years and if we're here 10
[45:26] years or 15 years or 20 years and and
[45:28] and Lord knows I can't see beyond that.
[45:31] And and I'd love to be here the rest of
[45:33] my life, but I realize everybody gets
[45:35] old and and there comes a time to retire
[45:37] and if the Lord carries again, the
[45:39] rapture happens, I hope we all go. You
[45:42] know, I it's kind of a joke, but I
[45:44] somebody asked me when I would use a
[45:45] certain preacher, and I said, "Well, the
[45:47] Sunday after the
[45:48] rapture. There maybe be some people
[45:50] still need preaching, but that's kind of
[45:52] harsh." But but
[45:55] you but I plan on going. How about you?
[45:59] But but you think about the future and
[46:01] you think if brother Brandham approached
[46:03] ministry the way that many times we do
[46:06] and if he approached people many times
[46:08] the way we do today in the message I
[46:10] wonder if there wouldn't be a message
[46:12] today because he could have blown the
[46:15] whole thing up based on some of the
[46:17] nonsense that was going on but he didn't
[46:19] do it because he was looking at who
[46:20] these people might impact what would
[46:22] happen down the road and so we have to
[46:24] have some foresight in that sometimes we
[46:26] just want to come down so hard on
[46:27] something and and we're not looking at
[46:29] the long-term picture, looking at how we
[46:31] might be able to help that person or
[46:33] their family or somebody else in their
[46:35] family. So, we we want to take that take
[46:38] that big picture when we look at people
[46:40] and how we deal with people. So, what
[46:42] was Paul's approach? And there's two
[46:44] more groups of people we wanted to get
[46:45] to. First of all, apostates. So, that's
[46:47] those who have deliberately turned away
[46:48] from
[46:50] truth and and the second was sinners. An
[46:54] apostate is someone who they know the
[46:57] truth. They're they're they're not
[46:59] ignorant of it. They know it and claim
[47:01] to believe it. It's important. But then
[47:03] one day they turn against it. They walk
[47:06] away from it. And not they not only walk
[47:08] away from it, but most of the time they
[47:11] fight against it. So what they did fight
[47:13] for, they fight against. So that would
[47:16] be an an apostate scripturally. That
[47:18] would be someone who turns away from the
[47:20] truth. In 1 Timothy 6:3, Paul talking
[47:23] about uh actually how a man should work
[47:25] for a living and how she we should obey
[47:27] a boss. You think, well, that doctrine
[47:28] is not important. Paul said, 'If any man
[47:30] teach otherwise and consent not to
[47:32] wholesome words, even the words of our
[47:34] Lord Jesus Christ to the doctrine which
[47:36] is according to godliness. He said he's
[47:38] proud knowing nothing but doubting about
[47:40] questions and stripes of words. So, you
[47:41] begin to get a picture of this kind of
[47:43] person that uh you know that you maybe
[47:45] wouldn't be able to fellowship with,
[47:47] right? And and again, there's an
[47:49] exception to every rule, but but you try
[47:52] all you can to help the person, but
[47:54] here's somebody who knows everything,
[47:56] right? And and they're doting about
[47:58] questions and strikes and words where
[48:00] have come envy, strife, railings, evil
[48:02] surmisings, perverse disputings of men
[48:05] of corrupt minds, destitute of the
[48:06] truth, supposing that gain is godliness,
[48:08] so they're just in it for the money. He
[48:10] said, "From such withdraw thyself." So
[48:13] you've tried to help them and they just
[48:14] won't be helped. So you withdraw
[48:16] yourself. Jesus puts it this way. He
[48:18] said, "Don't cast your pearls before
[48:20] swine. Don't waste your time on them."
[48:21] They just want to argue. And we ain't
[48:23] got time to argue. We were not put here
[48:26] to argue about doctrine. We weren't put
[48:28] here to argue about these things. We
[48:29] believe What do you believe about these
[48:31] things? Well, I believe what a prophet
[48:32] said. I believe what the Bible says. And
[48:34] and of course, I've got my own opinions
[48:36] and things, but if you're going to argue
[48:37] with me about what a prophet said or
[48:39] what the Bible says, I don't have time
[48:40] for that, right? If I present the
[48:43] scripture to you or someone else
[48:44] presents it to me and we can't come to
[48:46] that, then that's a problem, right? And
[48:48] so, uh, people just want to argue. We
[48:50] don't have time for argument. We want to
[48:52] we just want to reach those that can be
[48:53] reached. We we want to put up that
[48:55] billboard that says hungry. And those
[48:57] that are hungry will come to it. So, we
[49:00] don't sit out here and fight at these
[49:01] websites that have come and and try to
[49:03] disprove them and all this stuff. Some
[49:05] of this stuff could be easily disproved,
[49:06] but we don't fight it. Why don't we?
[49:08] Because our time should be spent in
[49:10] reaching those who want to be reached,
[49:12] who are hungry for something, not in
[49:14] people who who know they they know. And
[49:16] God may reach down and grab a hold of
[49:18] them and bring them back. But it's going
[49:20] to have to be like Saul, right? And Paul
[49:22] of Tarsus who became Paul. They couldn't
[49:24] the Christians couldn't go down there.
[49:25] They he locked him up. They could have
[49:27] come down there and tried to argue with
[49:29] him, convince him, but it took a
[49:30] supernatural work of the Holy Spirit for
[49:32] him to become what God called him to be.
[49:36] So we don't waste our time. The Brand
[49:37] said, "God doesn't argue, neither does
[49:39] his children." Somebody said, "Amen."
[49:42] Amen. 2 Timothy 3:1, "This know also in
[49:44] the last days perilous time shall come.
[49:47] For men should be lovers of their own
[49:48] selves, covetous, boasters, proud,
[49:50] blasphemers, disobedient to parents,
[49:52] unthankful, unholy, without natural
[49:53] affection, truce breakers, false
[49:55] accusers, incontinent, fierce. They just
[49:58] can't control their passions. Fierce,
[49:59] despiser of those that are good,
[50:01] traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers of
[50:03] pleasure more than lovers of God. Having
[50:05] a form of godliness, but denying the
[50:07] power thereof. From such, turn away.
[50:10] Right? So, he's telling you there is a
[50:12] certain type of person that you can't
[50:14] help no more. You got to turn away.
[50:15] God's got to get a hold of them because
[50:18] they've they've turned away from the
[50:19] faith. They know the faith. They've
[50:21] turned away from it. Church, we don't
[50:22] want to ever get in that position. If we
[50:24] get to the place, I know there people
[50:26] don't like me mentioning the message in
[50:27] the pulpit and things like that, but if
[50:29] we get to the place where we're ashamed
[50:30] of the message, we got a problem. We get
[50:32] to the place where we're ashamed of the
[50:34] teaching of the scripture, we've got a
[50:35] problem, right? We got to be able to
[50:37] preach those things. And and if you if
[50:39] you turn away from those things and
[50:41] begin to act like the world and things
[50:42] like that, you can't help that kind of a
[50:44] person until God gets a hold of them.
[50:46] So, people who claim the faith or did
[50:48] claim the faith but are deliberately
[50:49] turning away from it, especially by not
[50:51] living it. He said in 2 Timothy 3:6 of
[50:54] this sort they which creep into houses.
[50:56] So this is a person who is actively
[50:59] trying to convince other people that
[51:00] he's right, right? And lead captive
[51:03] silly women laden with sins, led away
[51:05] with diverse lust, ever learning, never
[51:08] able to come to the knowledge of the
[51:10] truth. That's the ones he said stay away
[51:11] from them, right? You you don't want to
[51:14] you just let them go. Let them do what
[51:15] they're called to do, but you do what
[51:18] you're called to do. So they're actively
[51:20] deceiving the people. Another uh person
[51:22] that at times that you'd have to
[51:24] separate from is is somebody who was
[51:28] again in the church but not living
[51:30] right. Openly not living right. Yeah.
[51:34] Right. Like like somebody that and this
[51:36] not happening but if somebody come and
[51:38] sit among us and they want to take
[51:39] communion and they wanted to do
[51:41] everything that we did and and you see
[51:43] them end up in the bar drinking and
[51:44] carrying on at night and just
[51:46] egregiously and they're it's in your
[51:47] face, right? That kind of a person. And
[51:50] yet they say, "I'm a believer. I believe
[51:51] what a prophet said. I I come to church
[51:53] and things like that." Well, he's going
[51:56] to have to learn, right? We don't do
[51:59] stuff like that, yet the grace of God
[52:02] could save that person, right? And we're
[52:04] going to show you that because this was
[52:06] a particular case of immorality in 1
[52:08] Corinthians chapter 5 and verse 9. He
[52:10] told them, he said, "I wrote unto you an
[52:11] epistle not to company with
[52:13] fornicators."
[52:14] He said, "Yet not altogether with the
[52:16] fornicators of this world or with the
[52:18] covetous or extortioners or with
[52:20] idolattors." So he actually puts
[52:21] fornicators with covetousness, too. We
[52:24] sometimes we just gloss over the rest of
[52:25] that. We just want to get rid of the
[52:27] people who mess up morally. But look at
[52:29] the rest of this. He said, "For then
[52:31] must you need to go out of the world."
[52:32] He said, "But now, so so he said, you're
[52:35] not you're not to escape from the world,
[52:38] but he said, I've written unto you not
[52:39] to keep company. If any man that is
[52:41] called a brother be a fornicator or
[52:42] covetous or an idoltor or a or a
[52:45] drunkard or an extortioner, which such a
[52:47] one know not to eat? In other words,
[52:48] don't don't don't empathize with their
[52:52] sin. Right? Let them know that's wrong.
[52:54] The best thing you could do for them is
[52:56] tell them the truth. That's wrong,
[52:58] brother. You you shouldn't live like
[53:00] that. So, there's a place for that. But
[53:04] now, he said, "For what have I to do to
[53:06] judge them also that are without? Do you
[53:07] not judge them that are within?" Other
[53:09] words, this person claims to be part of
[53:10] the church. We're not talking about
[53:12] people just show up now and then.
[53:14] Everybody with me tonight? Not talking
[53:16] about people that just come once in a
[53:17] while. We want to help those people and
[53:19] and they're not they they don't claim to
[53:21] be anything. They're trying to get help.
[53:23] We want them to get help. This is a
[53:25] hospital. Yeah. But if you if they want
[53:27] to be a part of the church and they know
[53:28] better and you know they know better and
[53:30] refuse to live right, then there has to
[53:32] be some some distance put there. Now,
[53:35] and you got to pray about that. Now he
[53:38] said them were that are without God
[53:39] judge it. Therefore put away from among
[53:40] yourselves that wicked person. That man
[53:43] that Paul's talking about was put away
[53:45] from
[53:46] fellowship. But I love the grace of God.
[53:49] He was also restored. Yes. He was put
[53:53] away but he was also restored. See
[53:55] because Paul said in Galatians 6:1,
[53:57] "Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a
[53:59] fault, ye which are spiritual restore
[54:01] such a one in the spirit of meekness."
[54:04] Yes. Other words, understanding that
[54:06] considering thyself, lest thou also be
[54:08] tempted, understanding that we're all
[54:10] human and you don't want to be partaker
[54:13] of his sin, but you try to restore that
[54:15] person. So, Brother Brandham says this,
[54:17] and you you kind of go to one extreme to
[54:19] the other, but brother Brandham says
[54:20] this about someone who's out of order
[54:22] with tongues, and we've seen that and
[54:25] and in the time that we live in, we
[54:26] we've seen it. And people get out of
[54:29] order with that. Brother Brandham taught
[54:31] us how to do it in the sanctuary, how
[54:32] how to do it with the with the room and
[54:34] things like that. But brother Brandham
[54:36] said, "See, we misjudge these things so
[54:38] many times." So, Brother Brandham didn't
[54:40] teach that you just go and and grab them
[54:42] out of the sanctuary and pull them away.
[54:45] Right? He said, "We misjudge these
[54:47] things." He said, "Let's always try to
[54:49] think the very best of anybody." This
[54:51] will change your life if you can do it.
[54:54] Let's always try to think the very best
[54:56] of anybody who's trying to do what's
[54:58] right.
[55:00] I say, "God, help me today." Always
[55:02] think the very best of anybody who's
[55:04] trying to do what's right. Let's express
[55:06] our very best to them. Oh, they're
[55:08] trying. We don't know their heart. He
[55:09] said, "Unless you have
[55:11] discernment, right?" He said, "And if
[55:13] you're if they're wrong," he said, "Then
[55:14] if a brother be overtaken in a fault,
[55:16] let them which are spiritual go to that,
[55:18] brother, in a spirit of meekness,
[55:20] considering your own self, lest you be
[55:21] tempted. See if you can't reconcile that
[55:24] person. See, back to God." Don't say
[55:25] that they haven't got the right spirit.
[55:28] Huh? Now, now listen to what he's
[55:30] teaching us something. A person could do
[55:32] it, use a gift wrong, and it still be
[55:35] God
[55:37] and just like a preacher, a preacher
[55:38] could stand up here and and be just as
[55:40] wrong as could be in his moral life and
[55:42] still preach the word,
[55:45] right? And the truth is the you don't
[55:47] you don't throw away the word because of
[55:49] the vessel that come through. You amen
[55:52] the word, but you got to eventually
[55:54] that'll cause them to go into error if
[55:56] they're living like that. they'll end up
[55:57] in error because they they can't hold
[55:59] the word in that unholy vessel. But but
[56:02] while it's while it's right, it's right.
[56:04] So look, he said, see if you don't
[56:06] reconcile that person back to God. He
[56:07] said, I'm going to say something that's
[56:08] going to really stab you for a minute,
[56:10] so just sit still. The Holy Spirit can
[56:11] speak through a hypocrite. He said,
[56:13] exactly. I've seen it done. I can prove
[56:14] you by the scriptures that it's right.
[56:16] So Brother Brandham taught us to wait
[56:18] and then if the person does it again,
[56:19] then you go and talk to them, right? and
[56:21] do it in meekness and humility and make
[56:23] sure that they're not doing it just
[56:24] constantly in the church because that
[56:25] would interrupt the church. And and Paul
[56:28] when it come to this man that was in
[56:30] fornication, Paul practiced what he
[56:32] preached. Listen in 2 Corinthians
[56:35] chapter 2, uh Paul he he he he had this
[56:39] man put out of the church and then he
[56:41] says this, "Suff sufficient to such a
[56:43] man is this punishment which was
[56:45] inflicted of many." He said, "So that
[56:47] contrary-wise you ought rather to
[56:48] forgive him." Yeah. He said, "And
[56:50] comfort him, lest perhaps such a one
[56:52] should be swallowed up with over much
[56:54] sorrow." I love that Paul is thinking
[56:57] about the person.
[56:59] And you might have to swallow your pride
[57:00] to help that person back, rehabilitate
[57:02] them, and help them back into the
[57:04] church, but you may have to swallow some
[57:06] pride, but it's worth doing
[57:09] to help somebody.
[57:12] See, he said, "Lest he be swallowed up
[57:13] with over much sorrow. Wherefore I
[57:14] beseech you that you would confirm your
[57:17] love toward him." Other words, he said
[57:20] you you had to separate from him for a
[57:22] time, but now confirm your love to him.
[57:24] Don't don't just let him go feeling like
[57:26] he's out of the circle or you won't talk
[57:28] to him, things like that. So, another
[57:30] thing we're taught to shun is false
[57:32] teaching. Uh in 2 Timothy chapter 2 and
[57:34] verse 15, he says, "Study to show
[57:37] thyself approved to God, a workman that
[57:38] needs not to be ashamed, rightly
[57:40] dividing the word of truth, but shun
[57:42] profane and vain babblings." That's a
[57:45] good way to put some sermons I've heard.
[57:46] I mean, that's that's a good
[57:48] description. Profane and vain babblings,
[57:51] for they will increase unto more
[57:53] ungodliness. If somebody comes and tells
[57:54] you they're the eighth messenger or
[57:55] something just off the wall like that,
[57:57] you don't have to listen to that. Right.
[57:59] Right. Shun that. And their word will
[58:02] eat, he said, asth a canker. That's gang
[58:04] green. Of whom is himenius and feltus
[58:07] who concerning the truth have aired
[58:09] saying the resurrection is passed
[58:10] already and overthrow the faith of some.
[58:12] The resurrection is such a central
[58:13] doctrine in the scripture, such a
[58:16] central doctrine of Paul's teaching. And
[58:18] here they say, "Well, that's just not
[58:20] true." And the resurrection's already
[58:21] passed. He said, "You need to shun those
[58:23] people because their words will eat like
[58:25] gang green." So, who should we turn away
[58:27] from? People who know the truth, refuse
[58:29] to live it, refuse to repent of sin in
[58:31] their life, those who promote openly
[58:32] false doctrine. And I'll say this, I can
[58:35] put up with little false doctrine. The
[58:36] person's not pushing it on me. I'm not
[58:38] going to have them preach. But I can be
[58:41] friends with somebody who's in something
[58:42] false because I want to help them. But
[58:44] I'll say this, if they start pushing me
[58:46] on it, I'm not You have to separate. You
[58:49] have to shun that because if you're not
[58:50] careful, you'll catch a spirit. Are you
[58:52] still with me?
[58:54] So the key is they've been confronted
[58:57] about it and and will not repent. He
[58:59] said, "Shun those people." We do not
[59:01] shun folks because we disagree with them
[59:04] on something. Right. Right. We don't
[59:06] just do that. We try everything we can
[59:08] to help them. And then if they won't be
[59:10] helped, right, that's when we have to
[59:12] walk away. Brother Brandham talks about
[59:14] the state of Pentecostalism. And I'm
[59:17] closing in just a few minutes. I don't
[59:18] have very much tonight. But he says, I
[59:21] appreciate you bearing with me today. I
[59:22] know it's been quiet and slow, but
[59:24] that's just what where I'm at today, but
[59:26] I pray that it'll help you in some way.
[59:28] He said, "We're back to another desert.
[59:31] We don't want a desert, do we?" He was
[59:33] talking about the everpresent water from
[59:34] the rock. He said, 'We back to another
[59:36] desert. Dried up organization. We
[59:39] organized and lost our water. What was
[59:41] it? They put the basket over the light.
[59:43] He said, "That's exactly what Pentecost
[59:45] did when it began to organize and began
[59:46] to break up fellowship and saying,
[59:48] "Well, now we won't associate if this
[59:50] guy believes that." He said, "Go ahead,
[59:52] stay with him." I love this. Stay with
[59:54] him till he comes to the word of truth,
[59:57] the knowledge of truth, whatever it is.
[59:59] Let it go anyhow. Just go on be his
[1:00:01] brothers. And again, as long as the
[1:00:02] person is not he's not a person who's
[1:00:04] dangerous. He's not a There's people who
[1:00:06] are a danger to the church. They can't
[1:00:07] be in the church because they'd hurt
[1:00:08] somebody, right? That that's part of it.
[1:00:11] There's people that are like that. But
[1:00:12] as long as we can work with people, he
[1:00:14] said, "As much as possible, much as lith
[1:00:17] in you, follow peace with all men." As
[1:00:20] long as you can work with them, don't
[1:00:21] pick fights with them. Come on. He said,
[1:00:24] "Stay with him till he comes to the word
[1:00:25] of truth, the knowledge of truth,
[1:00:26] whatever it is, let it go anyhow. Just
[1:00:28] be his brothers." See, Peter was not an
[1:00:31] apostate because he briefly went back to
[1:00:33] Judaism and the law. Yeah. Come on. He
[1:00:37] did. But Paul confronted him on it and
[1:00:40] he changed. That's right. He was not an
[1:00:42] apostate. Paul continued to work with
[1:00:44] him. And in in our times, brother Moore
[1:00:47] was not an apostate. Though he never saw
[1:00:49] the message and continued to teach some
[1:00:51] false doctrine until he died. But
[1:00:54] Brother Brandham remained his friend.
[1:00:56] Right? He never saw it. He didn't turn
[1:00:58] away from it. He just couldn't see it.
[1:01:00] Right? There's a difference in that. But
[1:01:03] yet, here's the way Paul put it, and I
[1:01:05] love the balance of this. He said, "If
[1:01:06] in 2 Thessalonians 3:14, if any man obey
[1:01:08] not our word by this epistle, note that
[1:01:10] man, have no company with him that he
[1:01:12] may be ashamed." That's pretty harsh,
[1:01:14] isn't it? Yeah. But look at the next
[1:01:16] verse. Yet count him not as an enemy.
[1:01:22] So, you may have to separate. You may
[1:01:23] have to discourage it. You may have to
[1:01:25] walk away from it for a while. But even
[1:01:27] the apostate, even the person, don't
[1:01:29] count him as an enemy, admonish him as a
[1:01:31] brother. Pray for him.
[1:01:33] I'm glad that Ananas was willing to go
[1:01:36] down to Paul's house.
[1:01:38] Willing to do that. Somebody had to do
[1:01:40] it. I'm glad that somebody was willing
[1:01:42] to do it to follow the leadership of the
[1:01:45] Lord. The second is sinners. Paul says,
[1:01:48] "We don't judge those who are without."
[1:01:50] Did you catch that when we read it a
[1:01:51] little bit ago? We do not shun sinners.
[1:01:55] Brother Brandham says this. He said, "I
[1:01:56] don't blame the sinner from sinning."
[1:01:58] Now, if somebody's influencing you, you
[1:02:00] need to get away from that influence.
[1:02:03] Right? But we don't shun sinners just as
[1:02:06] a class because you could never leave
[1:02:07] this building. In fact, you could never
[1:02:09] be in this building.
[1:02:14] What were you before you met Christ?
[1:02:17] We're going to be reminded in a moment
[1:02:19] of what it was to be a sinner. And and
[1:02:21] that's what communion's all about. We
[1:02:22] were sinners, but through the cross, we
[1:02:24] had the blessings to the Gentiles. Yes.
[1:02:27] Oh my. Some because someone hasn't met
[1:02:29] that yet doesn't mean that we have to
[1:02:31] treat them bad. And I know there's
[1:02:33] people who think they can mistreat uh
[1:02:35] people who are uh sinners, people who
[1:02:38] are out in the world. They feel like
[1:02:39] they can rip them off in business deals
[1:02:41] and stuff. That's nonsense.
[1:02:43] We don't do that. In fact, we should be
[1:02:45] that much more careful with a sinner
[1:02:48] than even than we are among ourselves
[1:02:50] because we don't want to ever put a
[1:02:51] stumbling block in their way that might
[1:02:53] draw them away from Christ and say,
[1:02:55] "God, help me. Even in my attitude, you
[1:02:57] realize your attitude in the grocery
[1:02:58] store might affect somebody. The things
[1:03:01] you say on Facebook might affect
[1:03:03] somebody. The things we we we always
[1:03:06] want to get involved and fight things.
[1:03:07] Don't you realize that might affect
[1:03:09] somebody and turn them away from you and
[1:03:11] you might be the only conduit they have
[1:03:12] to be saved.
[1:03:16] Excuse me for yelling at you, but I
[1:03:19] don't think we think about things
[1:03:20] sometimes.
[1:03:22] Huh? Well, the Bible said I don't blame
[1:03:24] the sinner from sinning. If the sinner
[1:03:26] goes down, drinks beer and smokes
[1:03:28] cigars, goes to picture shows and things
[1:03:29] like that and acts like the world, I
[1:03:30] don't blame him. That's the only
[1:03:32] pleasure he's got now. It's the only
[1:03:34] pleasure he's ever going to have. That's
[1:03:36] sad, isn't it? So, that's right. I don't
[1:03:38] blame a pig for sticking his nose in the
[1:03:40] manure pile and eating manure. That's
[1:03:42] gross, actually. Certainly not. He said,
[1:03:45] "He's a pig. Let him alone,
[1:03:49] right? You can pull him out and put a
[1:03:50] little tutu on him and and a little hat
[1:03:54] and pull him out and and and and wash
[1:03:56] him real clean and like they do these
[1:03:58] pigs they bring to the fair and the
[1:04:00] first mud he sees, he's going to go
[1:04:01] right back to it. That's his heart. He's
[1:04:04] a pig." He said, 'Let him alone.' He
[1:04:06] said, 'But you people who call
[1:04:07] yourselves Christians and then do those
[1:04:09] things. He said, 'You the guy I'm
[1:04:11] after.' He said, 'You get a change of
[1:04:13] heart. You get a change of diet. Is that
[1:04:15] what happened when you become a
[1:04:16] Christian? Change of heart. A change of
[1:04:18] diet. That's right. You don't want the
[1:04:19] things of the world no more. Certainly
[1:04:21] not. We're to be salt and light. Why?
[1:04:23] Why hide that under a bushel? See, we
[1:04:26] love the sinner. Now, we don't become
[1:04:27] partakers of their sin. The Bible says,
[1:04:29] "Lay hands suddenly on no man." In other
[1:04:30] words, don't ordain people to ministry
[1:04:33] quickly because you don't want to be
[1:04:35] partaker of other men's sins. Supposed
[1:04:36] to know those that labor among among us.
[1:04:39] Keep thyself pure. So listen, we want
[1:04:42] you to come to church, but we aren't
[1:04:44] going to make you a deacon or put you on
[1:04:45] an instrument till you get saved.
[1:04:49] Right? Like at least, come on, church.
[1:04:52] We're not handing out jobs. When you go
[1:04:54] down to the Baptist church, you probably
[1:04:55] get a job right away. But we don't do
[1:04:57] that in the message. Why don't we do
[1:04:59] that? Because we've been taught a person
[1:05:00] has to be born again, it's not an
[1:05:02] overnight birth, it takes time,
[1:05:05] right? So, we don't just and I say those
[1:05:08] of us who play instruments and and do
[1:05:10] those things in the church and people
[1:05:11] who sing and all of that, we should hold
[1:05:13] our lives up always and and and police
[1:05:16] ourselves and examine ourselves, make
[1:05:18] sure that we're right and we got the
[1:05:20] right attitude and we got the right the
[1:05:22] right outlook towards things because
[1:05:23] it'll affect the service if we're not.
[1:05:25] We need to make sure that we're right
[1:05:27] with God. And it's okay to repent now
[1:05:29] and then say, "Well, I'm a Christian.
[1:05:31] You can still repent and still reach." I
[1:05:33] do it every day. I've told you before,
[1:05:34] every time I come out of that office,
[1:05:35] I'm asking God, "If there's anything I
[1:05:37] don't know about that I I haven't dealt
[1:05:39] with, Lord, take it out of me because I
[1:05:42] don't want to speak to your people and
[1:05:43] have that affected, have the word
[1:05:45] affected by my attitude or or or or my
[1:05:48] complexes or a root of bitterness or
[1:05:50] something that comes up. Lord, let me be
[1:05:51] pure. Let me be clean. Let me be holy."
[1:05:55] See Jude 2020 20 Jude verse 20 to 23
[1:05:58] says but you beloved building up
[1:06:00] yourselves on your most holy faith
[1:06:01] praying in the Holy Ghost keep
[1:06:02] yourselves in the love of God looking
[1:06:04] for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:06:06] unto eternal life. He said of some have
[1:06:08] compassion making a difference. You
[1:06:11] believe compassion could make a
[1:06:12] difference. He said others save with
[1:06:15] fear. Now that don't mean that you use
[1:06:18] fear to save them. That's not what the
[1:06:20] scripture is saying. He's saying others
[1:06:22] save with fear. In other words, you are
[1:06:24] afraid, right? There's a certain amount
[1:06:26] of godly fear. You don't want to be a
[1:06:28] part of what they're doing. You don't
[1:06:30] want to become like that. That's what
[1:06:31] that means. He said, "Hating even the
[1:06:33] garments spotted by the flesh." You you
[1:06:35] pull them out of the fire. In other
[1:06:36] words, if they're in the fire, you don't
[1:06:37] want to get burnt, but you do everything
[1:06:39] you can to pull them out.
[1:06:42] And if they don't want help, you can't.
[1:06:44] You stand there, you'll get burned up,
[1:06:45] too.
[1:06:47] See, sometimes in trying to help people,
[1:06:49] we get put in bad situations. But again,
[1:06:51] we we're just here to be light. Don't
[1:06:53] don't become a basket case and hide your
[1:06:55] light, but be light. There's got to be
[1:06:58] someone out there to be saved or we
[1:07:00] wouldn't still be here. Jesus said,
[1:07:02] "Blessed are they which do hunger and
[1:07:04] thirst after righteousness, for they
[1:07:05] shall be filled." Brother Brandham said,
[1:07:07] "The thing that we want to do is to
[1:07:09] preach a gospel that appeals to a hungry
[1:07:12] world." The thing we want to do is
[1:07:14] preach a gospel that appeals to a hungry
[1:07:17] world. You said, "Now, how can you
[1:07:18] appeal to a hungry world?" wanting to
[1:07:21] see where they come from, who they are,
[1:07:23] and where they're going. Unless you
[1:07:24] preach a gospel that raises Christ up in
[1:07:27] a living atmosphere. I pray that would
[1:07:29] always be the gospel that's preached
[1:07:31] here at this pulpit. Whether I'm
[1:07:32] preaching or somebody else is, let's
[1:07:34] raise Christ up in a living atmosphere
[1:07:36] right here around us. Now,
[1:07:39] you say, "But brother Ben, I'm not a
[1:07:40] preacher." Well, then you just let your
[1:07:42] light shine. Brother said, "Live your
[1:07:44] sermon."
[1:07:46] Brandon says this. He said, ' You may
[1:07:48] never see a vision. You may never put
[1:07:51] your hands on a sick person and feel the
[1:07:53] charge of Almighty God make a skeleton
[1:07:55] of a man turn back to life again. You
[1:07:58] may never see him standing yonder three
[1:07:59] or four rainbows. You may never see his
[1:08:01] image. You may never hear his voice, but
[1:08:04] still you can be a signboard that will
[1:08:07] reflect Jesus Christ by a life that's
[1:08:08] been so pure and unadulterated from the
[1:08:10] world. Not cluttered up with dirty
[1:08:12] things around your life, but a pure
[1:08:14] thing. It will cause the hungry heart to
[1:08:16] hunger and thirst to be like you. I
[1:08:18] believe the gospel still needs to be
[1:08:20] preached. Don't you? The blessing on the
[1:08:22] gentile world is still through the
[1:08:25] cross. I pray, Lord, help me to get rid
[1:08:26] of the
[1:08:28] basket. Just get rid of it and all the
[1:08:30] tools that made
[1:08:32] it. All my thoughts that are against the
[1:08:34] word, every every complex, just let it
[1:08:37] go so I can be a light to those that are
[1:08:40] in the world. Would we bow our heads
[1:08:42] together? Would you say that with me
[1:08:45] tonight? You want to be a light to the
[1:08:47] world. City set on a hill. God bless you
[1:08:50] tonight. The musicians would
[1:08:53] come. Heavenly
[1:08:56] Father, Lord, as we're about to enter
[1:08:58] the communion service, we're so
[1:09:00] thankful, Lord, for your keeping power.
[1:09:03] Your Lord, your help. I needed your help
[1:09:06] today and you've helped me. I appreciate
[1:09:08] that. Lord, I pray that you'd move for
[1:09:10] these people.
[1:09:12] Lord, sometimes in our vulnerabilities
[1:09:14] and our weaknesses, that's where you are
[1:09:15] made
[1:09:16] strong. Lord, if there's one here that's
[1:09:18] sick, I I pray as they just take the
[1:09:21] communion in obedience to your word that
[1:09:23] that sickness would would go away. Pray
[1:09:26] for you'd grant it, Lord. We thank you
[1:09:28] for these people. I pray you'd help each
[1:09:30] one of us, Lord, to be salt and light to
[1:09:32] a world, Lord, that many places they
[1:09:35] rejected the gospel, but there's got to
[1:09:36] be somebody out there that still wants
[1:09:39] to come in, still hungry. I thank you
[1:09:41] for that, Lord. Lord, I pray you'd help
[1:09:42] them. Help us to reach them. Lord, we
[1:09:45] thank you for it in Jesus
[1:09:46] name.
[1:09:48] Amen. The brothers would
[1:09:55] come and to
[1:09:59] magnify thy
[1:10:01] name.
[1:10:03] Flow through me.
[1:10:08] Holy
[1:10:10] Spirit
[1:10:11] flow through. Could we raise our hands
[1:10:13] and sing that to him one time before we
[1:10:16] go into the communion service? Won't you
[1:10:19] flow through me?
[1:10:22] [Music]
[1:10:24] Holy
[1:10:26] Spirit flow through me.
[1:10:32] Oh, thank you Jesus.

[1:10:51] And as I lift my
[1:10:57] hands to
[1:10:59] worship and to
[1:11:05] magnify thy
[1:11:07] name.

[1:11:26] chapter 11.
[1:11:37] [Music]
[1:11:38] Paul
[1:11:40] says, "For I have received of the Lord
[1:11:42] that which also I delivered unto you
[1:11:43] that the Lord Jesus the same night in
[1:11:45] which he was betrayed took bread. When
[1:11:47] he had given thanks, he broke it and
[1:11:49] said, "Take, eat. This is my body which
[1:11:51] is broken for you. This do in
[1:11:53] remembrance of me." After the same
[1:11:55] manner also he took the cup. When he had
[1:11:58] sucked, saying, "This cup is the new
[1:11:59] testament of my blood. This do you as
[1:12:01] often as you drink it remembrance of me.
[1:12:04] As often as you eat this bread and drink
[1:12:06] this cup, you to show the Lord's death
[1:12:08] till he
[1:12:09] come. Let's bow our head one more time.
[1:12:12] Heavenly Father, I pray Lord over these
[1:12:15] elements, Lord, the bread and the wine,
[1:12:18] Lord, which are a symbol, Father, of
[1:12:21] what you've done for us, what you did
[1:12:22] for us there on the cross. Lord, your
[1:12:25] blood was spilled for
[1:12:26] me. Your body was broken for me,
[1:12:30] Lord. So thankful for that.
[1:12:34] pray you'd help us, Lord, not to just
[1:12:35] take it as a form, but Lord, to believe
[1:12:38] what you've done, oh God. I pray you'd
[1:12:40] grant it, Lord. I pray you'd restore
[1:12:42] health to those that take the communion.
[1:12:45] Lord, may sickness flee away from us,
[1:12:48] Lord. I pray that, Lord, if there be any
[1:12:50] sins, Lord, that we've committed, may
[1:12:52] you forgive us, Lord. Oh, God. We don't
[1:12:55] want to be wrong. We want to be right.
[1:12:56] We want to hold, Lord, our testimony
[1:12:59] with pure hands so the world can see
[1:13:02] we're your billboards. Pray you grant
[1:13:04] it, Lord. We thank you for all that
[1:13:06] you've done. I pray you bless these
[1:13:08] people now as they come in Jesus name.
[1:13:11] Amen. And the steward will direct you as
[1:13:15] you come.

[1:23:22] You glad for the blood tonight? Amen.
[1:23:25] Let's go to John chapter 13.
[1:23:28] [Music]
[1:23:31] And we always try to have foot washing
[1:23:33] after communion. And believe it'll be a
[1:23:35] help to us tonight. I know some get
[1:23:38] older and it's hard for them to do that.
[1:23:40] I know I see some of you trying to do it
[1:23:42] and you almost can't get back up and I
[1:23:44] we appreciate the effort. There's no
[1:23:46] salvation in it, but it is such a
[1:23:48] blessing when you can do it. So, if
[1:23:51] you're not feeling well or something, I
[1:23:52] understand that. But, uh it just just
[1:23:56] something I'm glad he left us these
[1:23:57] things because it kind of grounds us. I
[1:24:00] know people don't see a value in
[1:24:01] communion anymore and footwashing, but I
[1:24:03] do. I really do. I think brother Random
[1:24:05] left those and Paul left those for us
[1:24:07] for a reason. We should follow that
[1:24:09] pattern. So we're going to do that. John
[1:24:12] chapter
[1:24:14] 13 he says Jesus knowing that the father
[1:24:17] verse three had given all things into
[1:24:19] his hands. They was come from God went
[1:24:21] to God. He rises from supper and laid
[1:24:23] aside his garments and took a towel and
[1:24:25] girded himself. After that he pth water
[1:24:28] into a basin and began to wash the
[1:24:30] disciples feet and to wipe them with the
[1:24:33] tower where he was
[1:24:34] girded. Then cometh he to Simon Peter.
[1:24:37] Peter said to him, Lord, dust thou wash
[1:24:39] my feet? Jesus answered said to him,
[1:24:41] "What I do, thou knowest not now, but
[1:24:43] thou shalt know hereafter." Peter saith
[1:24:45] unto him, "Thou shalt never wash my
[1:24:46] feet." Jesus answered him, "If I wash
[1:24:48] thee not, thou has no part with me."
[1:24:50] Simon Peter said to him, "Lord, not my
[1:24:52] feet only, but also my hands and my
[1:24:54] head." Jesus said to him, "He that is
[1:24:56] washed needeth not saved to wash his
[1:24:57] feet, but is clean every wit. You're
[1:25:00] clean, but not all. For he knew who
[1:25:02] should betray him. Therefore said he,
[1:25:03] you're not all clean." So after he had
[1:25:05] washed your feet, and taken his
[1:25:07] garments, was sat down again, he said to
[1:25:09] them, "Know ye what I've done to you.
[1:25:11] You call me master and lord. You say
[1:25:12] well, for so I am. If I then, your lord
[1:25:15] and master have washed your feet, you
[1:25:16] also ought to wash one another's feet.
[1:25:20] For I have given you an example, you
[1:25:21] should do as I have done to you. Verily,
[1:25:23] verily, I say to you, the servant is not
[1:25:25] greater than his Lord, neither he that
[1:25:26] is sent, greater than he that sent him.
[1:25:28] He said, if you know these things, happy
[1:25:29] are ye if you do them. So, we can be
[1:25:32] happy about it tonight. God bless you.
[1:25:34] Let's pray one more time. Heavenly
[1:25:35] Father, Lord, I thank you for the
[1:25:38] privilege of of coming to this service,
[1:25:40] Lord, and coming to the end of our first
[1:25:42] five years here at the church. I I just
[1:25:45] thank you for such a wonderful people,
[1:25:48] Lord, and we've all grown together, and
[1:25:50] I appreciate that, Lord. I thank you for
[1:25:52] Lord their kindness to me and to my
[1:25:55] family. Lord I know that you put that in
[1:25:57] them to be that way and thank you for
[1:25:59] that. I pray you'd help us Lord. Bind us
[1:26:02] together in love. Oh
[1:26:04] God we don't we don't want to be live
[1:26:08] just live our own separate lives and do
[1:26:09] what we want to do. But we are love
[1:26:11] slaves to the gospel. Lord than whatever
[1:26:14] you have me to do whatever you want me
[1:26:16] to do as a pastor. whatever you want
[1:26:17] these other brothers to do, these other
[1:26:19] the people in the church, the officers
[1:26:20] to or the lay people, I I pray that
[1:26:23] you'd help us to find the will of God,
[1:26:25] Lord, and just walk in it. I pray you'd
[1:26:28] grant it, Lord. Lord, we don't ever know
[1:26:30] when it's the last time we may take
[1:26:32] communion or footwashing with one
[1:26:34] another, Lord. So, we just want to we
[1:26:37] just want to take it, Lord, as if it's
[1:26:38] our last time, knowing that just around
[1:26:41] the corner, just around the bend, we'll
[1:26:43] drink it with you and your kingdom.
[1:26:45] Lord, we thank you for that promise.
[1:26:47] Pray you'd bless us now. We pray in
[1:26:49] Jesus name. Amen. God bless you tonight.
[1:26:52] The the
[1:26:54] brothers come back here. The sisters go
[1:26:56] back into the foyer. Um, brother Harvey
[1:27:00] will direct you back. Don't all get up
[1:27:02] at once. He'll direct you back, the
[1:27:03] brothers back into here. I believe
[1:27:05] there's room for the sisters. So, God
[1:27:07] bless you.
[1:27:11] [Music]

[1:27:41] strength. From
[1:27:43] day to
[1:27:46] day, it will
[1:27:49] never
[1:27:51] lose its power.
[1:27:56] Oh, for it
[1:27:59] reaches to the
[1:28:03] highest
[1:28:07] mountain and it

[1:28:48] shed on
[1:28:55] Calary. Those
[1:28:59] preious blood
[1:29:02] stains, they were made there just for
[1:29:08] me.
[1:29:13] for all my
[1:29:17] sins, all my
[1:29:20] sickness
[1:29:22] and my pain.

[1:29:58] [Music]
[1:30:00] that
[1:30:02] takes me
[1:30:06] through when
[1:30:08] life is
[1:30:10] pressing me.
[1:30:16] I have a
[1:30:22] source of
[1:30:24] power
[1:30:26] from
[1:30:31] above. I'm

[1:39:38] [Music]
[1:39:41] I'm going to be ready to
[1:39:48] go. There is going to be a meeting in
[1:39:53] the air in that sweet, sweet by and by.
[1:40:00] I am going to meet you, meet you over
[1:40:04] there in that home beyond the
[1:40:10] sky. Such singing you will hear, never
[1:40:14] heard by mortal will be glorious, I do
[1:40:19] declare.
[1:40:22] And God's own son will be the leading
[1:40:26] one at that meeting in the
[1:40:31] air. You have heard of little Moses in
[1:40:36] the bull rush. You have heard of
[1:40:39] fearless David and his sling.
[1:40:43] You have heard the story told of
[1:40:46] dreaming
[1:40:48] Joseph and of Jonah and the well you
[1:40:52] often
[1:40:53] sing. There are many many others through
[1:40:57] the
[1:40:59] Bible. I should like to meet them all. I
[1:41:03] do
[1:41:04] declare by and by the Lord will surely
[1:41:08] let us meet them. at that
[1:41:12] meeting in the
[1:41:15] air. And there is going to be a meeting
[1:41:20] in the air in that sweet, sweet by and
[1:41:26] by. I am going to meet you, meet you
[1:41:31] over there in that home beyond the sky.

[1:42:36] one at that
[1:42:38] meeting in the
[1:42:41] air. Many things will there be missing
[1:42:45] in that
[1:42:47] meeting. For the mourers's bench will
[1:42:50] have no place at
[1:42:52] all. And there will never be a sermon
[1:42:56] preached to sinners.
[1:42:59] For the sinner has refused to heed the
[1:43:02] [Music]
[1:43:03] call. There will be no mourning over
[1:43:07] wayward loved
[1:43:09] ones. There will be no lonely nights of
[1:43:12] pleading
[1:43:14] prayer. All our burdens and our anguish
[1:43:18] will be
[1:43:19] lifted at that meeting in the air.
[1:43:26] And there is going to be a meeting in
[1:43:30] the air in that sweet sweet by and
[1:43:36] by. I am going to meet you, meet you

[1:43:52] mortal ear will be glorious I
[1:43:58] do and God's own son will be the leading
[1:44:03] one at that meeting in the

[1:44:17] And

[1:44:24] there in that home beyond the
[1:44:29] sky. Such sing you will hear never heard

[1:44:39] declare.
[1:44:41] And God's own son will be the leading
[1:44:46] one at that
[1:44:48] meeting in the
[1:44:52] air. I'm so
