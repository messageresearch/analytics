i if i forgot any names or anything like that y'all just forgive me for that i'm just glad to be in the house of the lord and we counted an honor to be here with brother um andrew glover and brother josh and these young men are wonderful men of god young men that love love this message and and we're very thankful for young men that are rising up aren't you glad for young men that are carrying this message amen carrying that banner let's look here in genesis 13 and the 10th verse and lot lifted up his eyes and beheld all the plains of jordan that it was well watered everywhere before the lord destroyed sodom and gomorrah even as the garden of the lord like the land of egypt as thou comest unto zore then lot chose him out of the plain of jordan and lot journeyed east and they separated themselves the one from the other and abram dwelled in the land of canaan and lot dwelled in the cities of the plain and pitched his tent towards sodom but the men of sodom were wicked sinners before the lord exceedingly and the lord said unto abram after that lot was separated from him lift up now thine eyes and look from the place where thou art northward and southward and eastward and westward for all the land which thou seest to thee will i give it and to thy seed forever i'd also like to look here in the book of revelations the 20th chapter and we'll start at the first verse amen praise the lord are you glad you're a christian amen i tell you what that message last night was wonderful amen now uh revelations 20 and 1 and i saw an angel come down from heaven having the key of the bottomless pit and the great chain was in his hand and he laid hold on the dragon that old serpent which is the devil and bound him a thousand years and cast him into the bottomless pit and shut him up and that he uh should deceive the nations no more until the thousand years should be filled and after that he must be loosed for a season let's go to the lord in prayer father we just want to thank you tonight for your love and and we're asking lord that your holy spirit would just come in a real special way and and that you would minister your word we have felt your presence we've loved the songs we there's something about a meeting like this lord where we can all get together it's a it's such a great encouragement to the local church and and lord it's an encouragement father for those of us who are visiting lord but lord the most important thing is for you to come and i'm asking lord that you would minister to us and that you would speak lord that you would meet every need that is present in the name of the lord jesus christ can the church say amen and amen god bless you you may be seated amen i want to speak here tonight on she possesses all things and um amen uh i'm i'm not a deep speaker by any means those have hurt me you know that but my heart is to help god's people and i and as i was in prayer i i have um wanted to to be uh you know be a blessing but not just preach any sermon we got a lot of sermons that any of us can preach but we want god to be a part of it and and this this message is this thoughts have been coming to my mind she possesses all things i i think about keys as amen uh these there are many keys to many doors there's uh there are the keys to homes there you got their key to your interior doors exterior doors you've got keys to your car doors you've got keys to for the car ignition you've got keys for the office you just you got all kinds of keys and uh these days keys are sophisticated you've got amen uh not the old skeleton keys that your great grandma had but you've got you you've got uh key fobs that you can carry in your pocket and any man get up close to the car and just push a button and it'll open up for you and you can push a button in your car and amen and and and it opens it it starts for you and you you can just leave the device there in your in in your car or in your purse and and uh you know it's an incredible thing you think of keys there's also the security passes that are that are very common and popular today they hey man you can swipe a swipe a card over a locking device and and uh uh it'll open your motel room it'll allow you in your office it'll it'll allow you to amen even even transfer money from your your bank account amen and uh uh to to the gas station without even having to go inside i mean amen but there is it's a key there's a special key that only you can use uh uh to to get into those funds can you say man amen these days they've got the yeah you know they've got the numeric codes where you can amen uh you can put them on your computers and it locks others out of your personal information and uh amen the only person with the passcode is uh is to a man uh uh is the only one that can get inside there can you say amen amen but the common denominator between amen with the key is the owner amen and the one that has been given the permission to use that key now you can have a key but if you don't know i hey man my my boys uh joshua man he used to carry a big old thing of keys around amen and a big old wad of keys that you know you'd ask him well where do these keys uh go to he didn't have the slightest idea but he was feeling pretty important amen he had a kid he also when he was younger he had a he had a wallet plumb full of cards he man i mean i you know i'd pull my wallet out and i'd have a few carts and he'd pull his wallet out and his i mean his was packed with cards now it didn't go anywhere amen he didn't know what he was using those things for but he had so it's not just having a key it's not just having amen a card or a passcode but you've got to be a part of the owner what can you say man amen the owner of the house he's the one that possesses the keys to it the owner to the car is the one who has the key to the car amen so that security code is not just for anybody it is for the one amen that has been authorized to use it well praise the lord amen now i'm the owner of my house and amen and i i've got the key to my house but i've also got some daughters in law amen i've got three of them and they've got keys to my house i won't give it to my boys but i'll give it to my daughters-in-law amen and so they can go into my house anytime they want to amen they can help themselves to the refrigerator anytime they want to because they've been given permission they've got the key in their hands well praise the name of the lord amen now when i talk about a bride that possesses all things this is not a wannabe bride this is not somebody and it's hoping to someday be a bride i'm not talking about somebody amen that that that has heard of somebody who knows somebody who knows somebody who has a key i'm talking about somebody who possesses the king hallelujah someone were to throw the key amen to one of you young men and uh amen throw you the key and and and tell you you know run down to the store amen you don't have to go back and ask again you've been given permission why somebody threw the key to you you've got the permission well praise the lord i wonder sometimes why it is we'll sit in a church and we'll be beggars and asking god i don't know if it's your will i don't know if you love me i don't know amen of healing is for me i don't know what my children can be saved the prophet of god said the very same faith you have for yourself you can use it for your children now praise the lord amen somebody's just got to use the key hallelujah amen what can you say amen you see it's in the kingdom there and then there's also the master key now the master key is a really important key because that key right there it can open any door in the facility hallelujah now you might have a key to your office and and and you might have a key to your office you have an office hallelujah you got an office now i am and you might have a key but the one with the master key amen can open your door your door your door your door and your door because and this is not just given just to anybody this is a special individual that's been given a master key and this master key can open any door any time any place under any condition because he's got the master key praise the lord amen i so i so that we're not just dealing with just a key but we're dealing with the master mastercam well can you say amen amen you see the pride it's not just been given a key but the bride has been given a master key are y'all listening to me divine revelation is the most empowered a key that you can ever have amen now the baptist might have a little key uh the you know the the presbyterians might have a key the charismatics may have a key amen there may be some that have a key to speaking in tongues or maybe some has a key to amen prophecy maybe some has got a key to even to wealth amen but you see the pride has got something not just for amen speaking in tongues although it works for speaking in tongues amen it's not just for prophecy although it works for prophecy but we've been given a key that can possess every problem well i'm fixing to start preaching here every promise of god is yes and amen to that bride hallelujah amen aren't you glad for that here tonight hallelujah you see you can possess amen you can possess a key and not possess all things amen you can possess wisdom and not possess all things you can have tongues of men and angels and not possess all things amen but i want to tell you tonight eternal life is the possessor of all things abraham was authorized to possess a man by the one who had called by the one who owned by the one who had created all things he told abraham i want you to rise and i want you to possess i want you to look to the east i want you to look to the west i want you to look northward i want you to look southward and everything that you see i'm giving it to you you can rise and possess it for the promise is unto you and to your children are you hearing me amen you see lot didn't have that key of divine revelation lord didn't have that little special something there but you see god gave the key to abraham he was the possessor lot wasn't given that key of revelation and and so he he didn't understand it and when it came down to the trials and everything all going crazy for him he he went down into into sodom and gomorrah amen he wasn't privy to all of the things that abraham knew are you hearing me abraham didn't get upset about it abraham what the bid up said about it abraham knew that he possessed even a lot down there amen now brother branham says abraham was heir to all by the promise so he could lay claim to everything that was in the land and the land itself abraham was given the promise now we understand that abraham was the poorest man in all the country because he lived out in the desert and lived in peace with god lot rich and lived in the city become the governor of the city and he said in the gate he was a judge he judged the city and all the riches and things and but abraham was in the desert perhaps the poorest man in the land yet he had a claim to possess all of it amen i like that well can you say man amen he says old tonight you may not be rich with the world's goods but we possess all things the world itself the church itself possesses all things yet poor yet rich and possesses all things i like that the old song we used to sing years ago my father is rich with houses and land he holds the world of the wealth of the world in his hand rubies and diamonds and silver and gold his coffers are full his riches untowed and we are the possessor of it oh now some of you is looking at me and saying brother went up hey man my my my promise is behind enemy lines tonight amen my promise i've been waiting and i've been longing i wish i could get it past the enemy lines amen brother wendell those that lines of defeat it's been in my family for many years even that sugar diabetes has gone back to my amen my daddy and my grandfather and my great-grandfather amen no one's ever been able to get past those enemy lines amen i want to tell you you've got a key to get past the enemy's gates he meant somebody may be staring down cancer tonight and the doctor telling you that you can't make it that you're past all hope i want to say you've got a key amen to deliverance and a miracle in your body tonight amen maybe you're looking maybe you've got a temper that you can't get rid of but i want to tell you in the name of jesus christ there is a key and you can possess every gate of the enemy i don't care what it says i don't care what you're feeling i don't care what the enemy looks like take the key out of your hand and take forward possess your land [Applause] can you say man i mean it doesn't matter what your promise is laying at hallelujah i said it doesn't matter what your promises are laying at i said it does not matter where your promises are laying at amen i don't care if there's giants on your land caleb you can possess it hallelujah amen the devil's a liar he is always lying every time he opens his mouth he's lying it's time for us to quit believing what he says and it's time to pull the key hallelujah oh come on church maybe you ain't got the key but you can have the key tonight you can possess all things possessors amen hallelujah somebody raise up your hand and say

that is willing to rise up and defeat the enemy in this day there's got to be somebody that says enough is enough i'm going to possess my promises [Applause] [Music] oh yes but you know the scripture says that he that overcomes becomes a pillar in the house of my god hallelujah that's what he said he that overcomes becomes a pillar in the house of my god every age has had to overcome all right

fulfilled can you say that i think of solomon because he's dedicating the temple and he's reminiscing he's reminiscing back to the good words all the words of moses saying that the land is yours looking back amen there'll be plenty of fighting hallelujah times you think you're not going to make it come on but you're going to make it because i've given you this land solomon is now building the temple and he's acknowledging the mighty hand of god there in first kings 8 and 56 and he said blessed be the lord somebody say blessed be the lord that hath given rest unto his people israel according to all that he promised there has not one there is not failed one word there hath not failed one word not one word of all his good promise which he promised by the hand of moses his servant i want to say tonight amen let me jump up there and say there has not failed one word of god's good promise hallelujah can you say man david expressed the key to his victories he meant he said there in psalms 1 24 and 1 if it had not been the lord who was on my side and then he pauses i like this scripture i love i love going back and reading this he says if it had not been for the lord who is on our side and he pauses and he says now may israel say and then he goes back again and repeats it amen he says if it had not been the lord who was on our side when men rose up against us then they had swallowed us up quick with their wrath was kindled against us then the water was o would have overwhelmed us in the stream going over our soul then the proud waters had gone over our soul blessed be the lord who hath not given us prey to their teeth somebody should be doing some shouting here tonight blessed be the lord who has not given me to be pray blessed you should be dead you should be in jail you should be in a in a mark but because god's been faithful to if it had not been for the lord who was on our side we would have been defeated yes sir thank you lord come on lord amen blessed be the lord who has not given us as pray to their teeth our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snares of the flower the snare is broken and we are escaped our help is in the name of the lord who made heaven and earth what can you say amen sons of god if it had not been mama amen turn to your neighbor and said if it had not been come on come on now amen some of you young people have received the holy ghost this last year and i say if it had not been for the lord you would be a part of statistics but god's been faithful to you god's been faithful to you to feel oh come on church i mean what are you sitting there discouraged about why are you all defeated about has it has it been that long since you went back and seen what god has done for you has not god saved you that's not god filled you has not god saved your children that i think he deserves some praise i've received a lot of criticism saying that i work people up and i want to tell you amen how is this working people up when you can preach the promises of god and people are being sealed filled with the holy ghost delivered [Applause] and you're right the preacher shouldn't be working anybody up but if he is working anybody up you should be ashamed amen come on come on come on but you're supposed to supply the oil right he supplies the fire you supply the oil and i promise there ain't no cold fire you ever get

you i was discouraged amen but if it had not been for the lord that was on my side and a good friend amen to help me through those times you say what was it it was god amen giving that grace to rise above it [Applause] hallelujah the reason why you haven't found no grace to rise above anything is because you've locked your key or maybe you've lost your key but it's time to get out find your key

i went to hell and i took the key [Applause] [Music] it doesn't matter what the pomegranate the cankerworm the caterpillar the locust it doesn't matter what any of them has done it might look bad it might have looked rough but i still possess the key and in this last day i've come to give you that revelation well come on church hallelujah amen brother bradham says i'm told the aviators who fly amen these here real fast jet planes he says they say that plane getting up to a certain speed it vibrates and it shakes and it seems like the boats is going to fly out of it and the wings are going to come off until they pass that sound barrier but once they pass that sound barrier they say the plane just sells out just in ease when it passes the sound barrier that's the obstacle that's in the way of the plane and when it passes its own sound somebody say when it passes its own sound amen you've got to pass your own sound you've got to pass your own complex you've got a cam aiming past your own even filters that you've got that is keeping the word of god from being real in you i said you've got to pass your own sound but when you pass your own sound amen then it runs at ease he says if the church of this day could ever pray till they pass the sin barrier the unbelief barrier then they could shout the victory of a living god when they once passed that barrier by looking to the unseen and letting the world vibrate and do what it wants to but there is a living god he says when we lose our unbelief in him and past that place that the world is saying the days of miracles has passed makes you shake for there's no such thing as the baptism of the holy ghost it makes you wonder if you just just look on at the unseen to the god who promised it for the promises unto you and your children to them that are as far off even as many as the lord our god shall call if you'll look to the blessed word that says jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever and turn your heads back and press on until you pass the vibration past the unbelief barrier or that the sin barrier all the barriers that seem to hinder you then you can fly free in the faith of god what is faith it's revelation what is the key it's the revelation jesus the revelation of jesus christ [Music] some of you are still looking at me like a mule looking at a new gate why don't you try that technique on the devil next time hey come on come on the next time the devil tells you well you're just a nicking booty [Laughter] is that a word the next time he tells you that you're going to miss the rapture

shopkins [Applause] i've got the insurance i've got the key i've got the promise [Music] [Applause] all the barriers that seem to hinder you then you fly free in the faith of god knowing that all things are possible there is there no limit right through the speed the plane will go there's no limit to the strength speed the plane will go there's no mark do the blessings that god will pour down upon a believer that will believe come on can you put that in your acts 13 acts acts 13 and 48 hallelujah billy come on halloween there's no limit yesterday there's no limit when the gentiles heard this they were glad and glorified the word of the lord that has many oh yeah as we're ordained to receive the key glory as many glory as we're ordained to eternal life was given the keys if you were written if your name was written in the lamb's book of life if god has given you this message why don't you quit taking this message as if it's a it's another denomination i realize that it is god's golden scepter that he has for such a time as this have you come into this kingdom i give you your invention you're not one of those girls you're not one of those one of me you are the pride of jesus christ [Music] i catch i said i'd like this you possess all things [Applause] they said it reminded me back when i was a kid i said man i never could preach like that praise the lord all right i'm going now there was a key given to the old testament it's not going to hold you too much longer the key given to the old testament saints daniel possessed the key to the lions all right come on that's the key to the fire amen jonah possessed the key to the waters down the bottom of the wall can you say it now moses possessed the key to the red sea all you've got is an ear infection hello [Applause] in our church had a bad infection in her tooth a man had a real bad infection and i mean swell up she didn't have no insurance and then no one wanted to no one wanted to pull the tooth because her tooth was so i mean it was just it was all abscess it needed to come out and and uh but her blood pressure goes skyrockets i mean way up there hallelujah and i mean she said man i don't know what to do hallelujah so you know what we done we took the handkerchief of the preacher that was preaching that night he met and told her you just take that smelly thing and you just put that right there on your jaw and go to hallelujah she said she woke up the next morning and the tooth was on the pillow and all of the stuff was all gone [Applause] [Applause] she didn't just possess the key to that portion of the wall she possessed the key to boaz's lineage all right [Music] she has [Music] but when jesus rose and says i possess the key all right amen i possess the key to the demons and the powers [Music] the key the key for the lions then that was a key come on come on the key for the fiery furnace was a key the key for the jonah don't try it amen it might not work for you right had no effect on you it was for them but when jesus rose and he says oh yeah yes sir i've got a key glory i have fought a fight and i've won and i've got the key come on glory and he says to all of my race i'm gonna give you that master key it'll defeat any demon any debt or any place any time under any condition somebody should be shouting on top of your chair right now hallelujah are you tired of me using that word p i want you to [Applause] my little is this okay tonight anyone know sean's girl anne hello i'm the reason that anne is filmed with an e hey man i told her mom it ain't they don't look good hallelujah adam green gables had an e [Laughter] and so i told her she she owes a lot to me i made her name look classy so but ann was born with no hip sockets for the morse you remember that no hip sockets amen and and so when what would happen is when you would change the baby's diapers the leg you can spin that thing right it looked like it looked like the superhumans just winded up except the baby would cry she didn't think it was a fun game hence i didn't try it so she went and so they uh we knew there was there was problems so she sean and rebecca took her in to the doctor and the doctor says yes we don't see these x-rays we don't see no we don't see no sockets and we're going we need to take you to a specialist so they put up with the specialist brother sean was it was out ministering um when the time come we all gathered together we were praying we believed the lord and and now they had told her they said now we're going to require surgeries she's probably going to walk with a limp and they have to end up having a brace all over her life she's gonna be walking with braces hallelujah and so they took senator to the to the the specialist there in oklahoma city they get up there come on the one specialist comes in man he's he's working all over turning this baby upside down all this work and then he goes he leaves the baby ghost gets another guy comes in they take a look at it looking at the x-rays they're mumbling back and forth they leave go get somebody else well you know they have all these doctors in the building and they all come and they say listen there's nothing wrong with that child [Applause] not it was not just it's not just a key for the old testament but the key that you possess is the divine key of revelation it is you being restored back to your position as a son of god amen now i've gone with myself too long to be able to finish my thought but i want you to catch where i want you to catch my and my drift here tonight amen is that this key that you and you have been placed back in your position of authority you are a son of god you always were a son of god the blood of jesus christ has simply brought you back to where adam and eve failed [Applause] hallelujah it's the exact key that jesus used on the devil when in defeating the mountain jesus knew who he was and when the devil was trying to come up and tell me he came right back with the word he stood toe to toe and he defeated him he didn't use any of his supernatural powers he simply took the revelation of who he was and quoted scripture all right brother says he'd done that amen he done that so that the weakest of christians can have confidence [Applause] [Music] [Applause] i don't care if you have six toes i don't care if you're as ugly as the death if you possess the key of revelation come on preach there is nothing amen can stand before you glory hallelujah he's the roots he's the vine or we're simply the branch the bride is not given anything different than jesus the bride has the original life the original science come on the original [Music] message jesus what makes you different is your name has been taken off and his name has been put on hallelujah all right gloria you are mrs jesus christ amen amen you can belong to a message to the message of christ you can belong to this filter and that filter on this case and if you do it the way god said it through the prophet i i i'm one of those guys that like saying it like he sings it say it like he says believe it like he believes i'm just not one of those guys that think that i'm just a little more divinely revelation i think god sent a prophet and if i want in that message to work i better do it and say it like he'd done it well praise the lord amen don't you believe that yeah yes sir then you'll see the supernatural brother branham says he will be as definitely floored today yes sir as when jesus withstood his every effort to gain power over him in the best way thank you yes satan hates revelation [Applause] but we will prevail over him i'm not under the antichrist spirit i'm not under that amen that dead lukewarm cold amen twice plucked up religion that i came out of amen satan hates me because i know who i am there is a fire pudding in my heart i've got something anchored down needs safety the blood when he sees her [Music] you're proud of me i found out how to use a timer i have not been over now revelations 3 and 7 and to the angel of the church in philadelphia these things saith he that is holy he that is true he that hath the key of david he that openeth it and no man shouted and shudder and no man can you see how important it is today what you say when you're preaching what jesus when he was trying to show the last days he was showing the key to watch this he showed it so emphatically now watch what brother branham says he says oh how beautiful are those words how majestic is even the sound of them how thrilling to think that all those attributes can be applied to one person who would dare to say such things about himself but the lord jesus christ the lord of glory i believe the key to interpreting exactly to what uh what each of these wonderfully descriptive phrases means is found in in uh in verse nine that he goes on now and he begins to and then he then he goes to another scripture here in isaiah 22 and 22 and he says and the key of the house of david [Music] now why is that key now i got my key did you need that key was that key important oh there it is i've got it man it ain't a ford key sorry so now i keep the key in my pocket some of you ladies keep your key in your purse but jesus has his key on now why is this key on the show the one who pulled the seals back and showed it to the seventh age message all right and the seventh age messenger is sitting there he's going to tell us right there's something special yes sir all right come on about he says the spirit uses his old testament reference concerning the lord jesus christ and somebody say and his ministry in the church all right what the key of david signified at that time is merely shadow which is now fulfilled in jesus standing in the midst of the lampstand it has to do with our lord after his resurrection and not his earthly government but what does this key signify he says the answer lies in the position of the king it is not in the hand it is not worn around his neck all right it is not placed in the hands of other men or the verse would be saying he alone has the key has the use of that key for his phone opens and shuts and no man has the right to jesus yes sir but where is the key it is on his shoulder what what does shoulder have to do with it yeah he says reader uh isaiah 9 and 6 and the government shall be upon his show oh yeah what does this mean the answer is this yeah i would love to be preaching on this but i took too much time before so i'm just reading this all right he says the answer is the phrase the government upon his shoulder comes from the wedding ceremony of the east when the bride has been committed to the groom right come on she takes off her veil amen and places it over the blue shoulder signifying that not only is he she under his dominion that she has transferred her rights to him that he is the head but also that he bears the responsibility and the care and that he and he alone no one else no other man no other power has any right and responsibility and that beloved is the key of david god being sovereign he for knew my divine decree exactly who would be in his bride he chose her she did not choose him he called her she did not come on her own he died for her he washed her in his own blood he paid the price for her she belongs to him and to him alone and she is wholly committed to him and he accepts the obligation he is her hand for christ as the head of the church as abraham called abraham sarah called abraham lord even so the pride is happy that he is her amen he speaks and she obeys for that is her delight anyone have a hanky or something i could use i'm going to pick on a greyhound uh i need a i need i need a i need a wife hallelujah man would you like to marry me just choke it can i use it it's gonna make me look bad so you're going to pretend like you're going to be in our life okay i'm already married okay so don't be thinking i'm looking for a wife now when you say when the preacher says will you be nice to her and and love her forever and i say yes and then you say lord no but you're going to say yes and you take you take the veil take my suit coat you're saying that i am and i'm going to love you and i'm going to obey you yeah but it's also something really yes sir come on all of my debts [Music] [Applause] anything that i'm ever going to
