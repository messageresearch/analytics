victory is mine victory today is mine and i told satan to get thee behind for victory today is mine well i woke up this morning i didn't have a doubt i knew that the lord would bring me out so i got

oh i told satan to get me behind all the victory today is mine amen thank the lord thank the lord you believe that tonight victory is mine thank you brother joe turn with me to corinthians actually we're going to turn to matthew chapter 5 and verse 5 and then we'll be reading from the ninth chapter of the book of corinthians we'll begin with matthew five and five just to get started this evening uh remember church saturday night at six o'clock with brother andrew glover so we've been trying to get him in for a while and so we're happy to be able to do that the lord willing on saturday night we're going to have some sandwiches and snacks in the fellowship hall because we have to feed the preacher after the service but you're welcome to stay and or bring something if you want to that and uh we're gonna have church sunday morning at ten o'clock again with brother andrew and uh we're gonna we're gonna eat again at the fellowship hall so if you want to join us and kind of a potluck you're welcome to do that as well i know it's hard right now with everybody worried about the coronavirus but most of us have already had it so we've we've been through that but and i haven't seen anybody get it twice they say you can but none of us have gotten it thank the lord so far twice and of course brother david's still working his way back up but he's doing well and and we thank the lord for that and and all the ones that have been sick and and thank the lord that we're back where we're supposed to be in the house of the lord amen and i trust that others will be able to join us as time goes on amen and and also that election you were given a ballot last week and if you didn't get one get one tonight and those are due on on sunday morning we'll count those during the service on sunday so have those in sunday morning by the end of the song service matthew chapter 5 and verse 5 blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth sounds like a pretty good inheritance doesn't it the whole earth that sounds like a pretty good one let's bow our heads for a word of prayer heavenly father i'm so grateful to be in your house again tonight there's just something in my heart lord that that longs to be in the house of god i was sitting there lord at the funeral in hot springs yesterday and thinking and our brother that passed away and how he had a desire to go to church and how his kids talked about that and lord that it would be so for every one of us i i trust that it is lord especially for those here on a wednesday night just something in our hearts we want to be in the house of the lord and we want to hear your word we hunger lord for it we hunger for fellowship with one another but more than that lord we hunger for fellowship with you lord so we asked you to come down today like you did with adam and eve in the cool of the evening lord and and spoke to them father and just had communion with them what a what a church service that must have been when you were there with them would you just do that with us here tonight we take just a simple subject and teach from your word but oh god would you just come and if there's something that needs to be said would you say it tonight lord and move me out of the way and speak through lips of clay we pray help us to hear help us to understand lord and help us to always lord remember that your word is the most important thing in our lives we thank you for it in jesus name amen amen god bless you you could be seated this evening blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth the definition of meek is they that hold all their passions and affections evenly balanced it doesn't just mean somebody that's quiet but it's someone who's in control someone who has it under control now paul uses the idea of self-control or keeping under the body is how he puts it in first corinthians chapter nine and that comes through meekness and temperance meekness is attitude temperance is action you find the two together in galatians 5 23 that meekness and temperance are two of the fruits of the spirit meekness is as i said attitude temperance is action and and they go together now temperance is also a virtue in second peter one and six and brother branham says this about that he says to my knowledge he said i had temperance that's a good place to add it it's to our knowledge because we we generally tend to be into more intemperate the more knowledgeable we become and he said to my knowledge i add temperance self-control he said i like that and and brother branham quotes a a song a patriotic song he says my country tits of thee crown my soul with self-control from sea to shining c and brother brown doesn't quote the entire entire verse but that comes from the second verse the original second verse of america the beautiful and it read like this it said oh beautiful for pilgrim feet who's stern in passion stress a thoroughfare of freedom beat across the wilderness america america god mend thine every flaw confirm thy soul in self-control by liberty and law yeah that's something america doesn't do today we look around us and we can see america's lost its self-control just collectively as a bunch they've just lost the whole idea of self-control that that they've reached a place where if i don't like your politics i'll kill you if i don't like the way the way you comb your hair i might kill you and that's the place that the world's reached today it's a lack of temperance it's a lack of meekness lack of self-control there's no self-control in the world's ministry today if you look at the worldly church there's no self-control in the ministry it's gain as much as i can by all the means that i can and then keep all i can remember john wesley said gain all you can keep all you can save all you can and give all you can and john wesley made a practice of at the end of the year that he would take all the he'd make sure he had nothing left at the end of the year and i don't say that we should emulate that but he always did that because he wanted to make sure that he was being temperate with his finances and we need we need to gain our self-control back and it's hard because we can get anything we at a moment's notice right you can go to amazon if you don't want it fast enough i i was able to text fedex today brother joe and that package i had sent to your house and have it sent to dollar general to be waiting on me so it would be quicker so i could get up here to the church and get a camera put in you know that's that that's having stuff at your fingertips we get upset if it's delayed we're used to instant gratification it's the culture and that's not what i'm completely preaching on tonight but paul deals with that in the ministry in 1st corinthians chapter 9 but he's not dealing with ministers he's not preaching at ministers he's using it as an example to the people at corinth who were intemperate in the way they treated one another and he's using his own temperance and his own meekness and saying that this is how i've controlled the ministry that i'm in and this is how the self-control that i've used in how i've preached to you and how i presented myself to you how i've lived around you and you use that as an example to them because he's saying here you guys can't even agree on what meat to eat and and whether or not to do this thing or to do that thing he said i have given everything up for the gospel and i think we need some more of that i i would just say that to you tonight and just before we get into the study but we need to we need some people that are willing to give up everything for the gospel that are willing to to be like the beggars were when they were there at the gate of jerusalem and and they said we're going to die if we stay here why sit we here till we die let's go on in let's let's find the camp let's go in and and try to get some let's be hungry for the word of god let's get a move on let's not just sit here forever and i think that would be every one of our hearts here tonight and and it's how we should be self-control that we would we would put things in their right order and we would we would stress on the things that need to be stressed on the branham defines temperances you can go look it up but he defies it as how to control your tongue and your temper not so much drinking is what we call temperance today but how to control your tongue and your temper if you can't control your tongue or your temper you're not qualified for the ministry it's true there's other qualifications beyond marriage for ministry and i'm saying that myself you know i'm preaching at myself not brother allen's but the other preacher's sitting here but if we can't control our temper in our tongues we've got problems i had brother david back here and you know if you've ever spoken before people you've got to control your temper in your tongue right you got to learn to do that now paul is setting a precedent you know what a precedent is if you have a court case the supreme court loves to use precedent they say well they don't want to do anything that hasn't been done before every once in a while they'll change a precedent but they don't do that lightly because once something is set in the law you just continue following that you know we wouldn't know without paul we wouldn't know how to conduct ministry at all we wouldn't know how to wash feet how to have communion we wouldn't know what we believe about the rapture we wouldn't know whether there was a resurrection there's a lot of things we wouldn't know without the apostle paul and that's why brother branham could look back at being the prophet of the end times he could look back at what paul preached and said if when he was there on the beyond the curtain of time and say i preached what paul preached and i challenge anybody to find something closer to what paul preached than this message right there's nothing closer to it because it's the very revelation of that and as it is in the light of this hour but but people you know you say well are the baptists close to what paul preached or the methodists or the pentecostals not to pick on anyone are the catholics close to what paul preached no no they're not you can just find glaring differences but we are supposed to be what paul preached amen and so he's setting a precedent brother branham talks in the church age book how that that pattern would be set for every true messenger down to the ages but it wouldn't just be the messengers who would also be the ministry down to the ages that that pattern would be set for and so paul deals with some things in corinthians beyond just the problems in the local church he sets the church in order and we're so grateful for that because it set us in order as well first corinthians 9 1 he says am i not an apostle he says am i not free have i not seen jesus christ our lord are you not ye my work in the lord now he's stressing his qualifications he says if i be not an apostle unto others yet doubtless i am to you because he started that church he said for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the lord you're you're the results of my ministry i thought about that and i thought you know every one of us are here because of the message of the hour all right i'm a result of brother brown's ministry in this age i really am and so are you these churches are that we have today are a result of the ministry of of william branham we can say it this way the ministry of christ and william branham or the result of that and and so the seal the apostleship you take somebody now they question that say well maybe it was a false prophet but we're the results of what he preached and i think those results are good results i refuse to just be negative about it all the time and say everything's just just going downhill and everything's going to the bride's just going to fall apart and and then we'll get by the skin of our teeth somehow we'll go into rapture no we're not going down we're going up right not everybody's bright but we're going up the bride's going up he didn't say there'd be a bunch of us jamie just said we were going up and so if it's just a few if it's just me and you then we'll keep preaching you keep listening and we'll keep working going up right and no matter what what happens and what goes on around us and though the world's lost all self-control will still be governed by the word why because we're the bride of christ amen we're predestined to do that we're preordained to be here he said this bride would not fall could not fall amen now so he says i'm an apostle i'm free there's no hierarchy over me and he said that apostleship gives me certain rights as a minister of the gospel i have certain rights and if i use my power who could stop me he's not really talking about abusing though some abuse the power of ministry but he's talking about using it to its fullness there's certain rights that i have i can use and you could say that with any position of responsibility there's certain things you could do and brother allen and i were talking about being at work late you know or doing something like that you know you could leave at 4 30 every day on the dot but you don't always because with great freedom comes great responsibility just because you can doesn't mean you should there's times you do things that you you go the extra mile and paul is setting a a standard a gold standard of that for us that he's saying that i went the extra mile he paul went beyond what he had to do way beyond what he had to do and yet he said certain things in the church at the same time so he says there's no hierarchy over me i have certain rights if i use my power who could stop me but the fact that you exist as a church is proof that i'm an apostle now brother brown says this he said character is a victory not a gift and that's a profound statement you've heard it before but just ponder that in this context for a moment character is a victory not a gift a man without character can't reign he can't reign god won't let him right so he's going to give us character so brother ben how do i get character you go back and see where brother was talking about this in the context he's talking about about the suffering and how god stands by and lets him suffer that's how you get character it's through suffering sometimes there's no other way but harvey but through suffering you get character we don't understand that we don't want to suffer none of us would choose to suffer none of us would choose to go through some of the things that you all have been through none of us would choose to go through that but but the fact that you're here god is working on your character because you're going to reign one day and he said a man without character can't reign because power apart from character is satanic but power with character is fit to rule paul is being challenged in his apostleship in his ministry and verse 3 said my answer to them that do examine me is this he says you're examining me you're saying that i don't have a writer i'm not an apostle or i shouldn't take the authority that i do so he says my answer to them that do examine me is this you know what the fact that paul's being criticized puts us in good company because we get criticized too but that's just part of being a christian he says in verse four have not have we not power to eat and to drink in other words have we not power to expect to be fed while we feed the sheep and then he says this he says have we not power to lead about a sister a wife as well as other apostles as the brethren of the lord and cephas i'd always taken this to mean that paul was defending or saying the fact that he was unmarried but actually what he's saying if you go and look at it is he's saying that these other apostles had a wife and a family that the church took care of and paul said i have the right for the church to take care of my family because as a minister that he's setting that precedent you understand that the church would take care of his wife and his children young children that's that's part of it right and then don't get nervous on me tonight because if there ever was a church that did wonderful in their finances it's this one for the number of people that we have as far as tithing you all just just do wonderful on that and your tithes paying a bunch of people and i appreciate that i couldn't be here and as i am with just working in the church and you support my family and i'm thankful for that so that's not why i'm preaching this tonight but he's saying when you talk about self-control in the ministry saying i have a right to but i don't the right is there but i don't now he said so i have a right for my family to live off of the gospel the apostles not only lived off the tithing he spoke of cephas which is peter the other apostles the brethren of the lord that lived not only themselves but their wives and their children off of the gospel he said verse six or i only and barnabas have not we power to forbear working in other words we have a right as the apostles to not work a day job we have a right to as we travel to be cared for by the church when paul would go somewhere he'd go get a job at the tent factory because that was his trade and it's a it's amazing but look at the example of humility that he put before us he said i'm not too good to work right give us a good example you know they say one of the the qualifications for being called to preach is loving fried chicken wanting to quit your job but that wasn't paul paul kept working and i was telling the brother brother allen earlier that you know i feel like i owe not so much an answer for the money although i i do feel a weight of responsibility for that but also for my time and not that i would never take a vacation because i'll do that and my family needs that but but at the same time i have to answer for that i have to work you know if i'm going to be a pastor i have to work i just do my work here or with you or or whatever that it is they're studying and and preparing these things but it's still work if somebody else stands behind this pulpit i still worked that week right and and so that's that's my job that's what i do and if if something happened and we fell into a depression and the church was unable to support me i'd go get a job and and have two jobs and that's what i did for 15 years and and so we would we would continue to do that and and so and there's nothing wrong with that in fact brother branham talks about that a man a christian will work he's the only one that will work now but he said we do have the power to forebear working verse seven who go with warfare who go with a warfare any time at his own charges who planteth the vineyard and eateth not all the fruit thereof you know if you go to war you expect there to be a supply tent and they give you the supplies and the stuff to be able to fight with because you're you're giving your life right you're fighting in that arena and so the people pay with their taxes and things to provide for our soldiers and and thank god for somebody who's willing to put their life on the line in that way so he says who go for warfare any time at his own charges who planted the vineyard and he has thought of the fruit thereof who feedeth the flock and he is not of the milk of the flock he says verse 8 say i these things as a man or saith not the law the same also i love the way paul backs this up he said this is scriptural we have a scripture for this verse nine for it is written in the law of moses thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn now that's a pretty fascinating statement because you know you think of some cheapskate that had to be written for a reason because somebody out there was muzzling the ox right because they didn't want him eating the stuff he was he was planting and stuff he was he was treading out the corn he was the one doing all the work and yet they muzzled him and written in the law of god said don't do that don't do that he deserves to eat of the work partake of the work that he's that he's doing and he says does god take care for oxygen in other words is god just saying that about about oxes about oxen or saith he al it all together for our sakes he said for our sakes no doubt it is written he that plowed should plow in hope he that thresheth in hopes should be partaker of his hope and that's why every minister will labor in his own field and be partakers of the prosperity of the people or the or the people the lack that the people have he's a partaker of that uh their struggles the minister receives tithes and pays tithes the minister doesn't pay ties he shouldn't receive ties that's right i have visiting ministers in and i'm i'm i'm going to bore you a little bit tonight i know but it's just where we're at and but i want to talk about self-control and i want to be open about these things brother branham was very open about things brother branham told us i think 27 times the message how much he made every week and the reason was because he wanted us to have confidence that he wasn't just taking all the money and people will say that today people slander preachers with that and it is a slander because the truth is the preacher the minister the pastor has a right to the tithes from the church period that's what paul taught but we use self-control in those things right now if a minister comes in that comes from my ties if i ever have to raise an offering here at the church for brother andrew somebody to come in we won't have them in because that's my job right and and then you know unless there was just so few here that we just couldn't do it but i i would i don't believe in that i that comes from my tithes that's that's my tenth i just won't have as many preachers in i'll save up my money until we're able to have them in brother joshua goff some time ago he may be listening tonight i uh a minister he had a really small church there in texas and south texas he's moved on to another church now but he had a little church here he kind of started and his family and and he saved up his money for months to have me come down and preach a meeting for him and i thank god for that you know that that's part of what we do that's what we're supposed to do that comes from my tithes evangelists preaching a weekend meeting here draw the same amount for a week's work as i do if they're a full-time evangelist because i i feel obligated i felt i don't want to muzzle the ox that treads out the corn and plus their their travel expenses brother brown says this about ties and we'll just we'll go into that let's read first corinthians 9 11 first he said if we have sown unto you spiritual things is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things and he says this he said would it be wrong to use tithes on church building funds and i know you understand this this is the worst church in the world to preach this to so i feel kind of self-conscious tonight because you all pay your tithes but but churches don't understand this people don't understand this all around the message they don't understand this and brother branham says well i don't say everywhere but places different places i've been they've not understood this he said well now he said here's a touchy little thing for the church now he said no correctly tithes is to go to the minister he said that's right in the bible they had a box they set up the door in the old testament he said in the building said the box was the fun with the people put in there for repairing so i don't think we're too unscriptural to have the the plates at the back during this covid time because that's what they did they put a box at the back he said but a tenth of the tithings he first has a tenth of that went and he says the tenth of the tithing but then he says all the tithings went to their priests their pastors so they had the box for the building fund tithings went to the priests he said yes tithings are to go for nothing else he said i know people take the ties give them to a widow woman that's wrong if you've got anything to give the wit a woman give her but don't give her god's money that's not yours in the first place that's god's tithings goes into the church for the pastor and so forth to live live that to live on he said like that to live on and then the building funds and things like that as a separate fund all together he said now that is scriptural and that's the way it's all i'd have to change that when i come to the church here was already set up that way and and so that's the way we do it now brother branham taught emphatically that tithe was god's program to support the ministry but it's become a common practice and i'm telling you what i know today it's become a common practice in the message for that not to happen for them to give some little amount to the preacher and send the rest to some missionary organization for the church to do that and it's not right it's not biblical if the pastor wants to do that let him do that he's got complete right to do that but the church shouldn't mandate that and so he said should a person pay tithes to an individual or should a christian work and that's a loaded question isn't it and there must have been some preacher that wasn't working much he said should a person pay attention to an individual should a christian work sure he should he's the one man that will work as a christian amen to that i've tried to teach my kids you have to work you got to go to work and you're not going to you know don't expect any money if you won't work right that's that's the magic that shows up in your bank account where you're able to go to starbucks and do the things that you do is because you worked right and people don't understand that until they actually have to do it a lot of times but he said he's the one that will work as a christian he said pay ties to an individual it depends on who the individual is see he said but when you pay tithings really where you owe tithing this is where you get your food bring you all your tithings into my storehouse saith the lord that's right and prove me i love this he said we're in saith god that if not if i'll not open the windows of heaven and pour out a blessing that you would not have enough room to receive it but i challenge any man or woman that's not a tithe player to accept that and i've seen that and i know many of you have as well and we don't have to go over that but i i've seen god do that when i would pay my tithes and do what was right first and then see god something appear not magically but by the blessing of god god would bless me because of that and first corinthians 9 12 he said if others be partakers of this power over you are not we rather in other words paul says i got a right to do to live off of the gospel and every other apostle did there was nothing wrong with that i do that brother branham did it but he says we got a right to do this he said arnold we rather nevertheless we have not used this power but suffer all things lest we should hinder the gospel of christ paul said here's how it should be done and i thank god he did that right because it's helped the ministry down through the years but he said here's how it should be done but myself i won't do that because people won't understand it right because my goal is to see souls saved i wonder when we lost our focus what's the goal what are we doing here we we keep ourselves under self-control to see souls safe we want to see somebody saved we're not here just to make ourselves feel better right we're here to see souls saved and there's got to be one left somewhere we would be gone all right when that last one comes in we'll be going so there's got to be somewhere there's got to be a soul needs to be saved might be here might be in africa might be in india it might be somewhere in china it's somewhere then let's do everything we can here everything we can in africa everything we can across the ocean wherever it is see one soul saved it's worth it and and god will the gospel come to them at the right time now he said we suffer all things lest we should hinder the gospel of christ verse 13 do you not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple just driving this this idea home that the ministry have a right to these things he said they which weighed at the altar of partakers with the altar even so hath the lord ordained that they which preached the gospel should live with the gospel he says the lord ordained now people will tell you that tithes are not in the new testament that's wrong so if anybody ever tells you that i've been told that i was told that by church of christ minister one time he told me tithes are not in the new testament well that's wrong not only does paul deal with it in this chapter and other places but jesus instituted it jesus instituted the idea of of tithing or the ministry uh living off of uh the things the the the things that the people had now uh that's matthew 10 10. you can go look that up he said don't take anything with you because the workman is worthy of his meat all right and that's what paul says the ox don't muzzle the ox that treads out the corn all right so jesus instituted that that's not so if anybody ever tells you it's not in the new testament it is in the new testament first corinthians 9 15 but i have used none of these things neither have i written these things that it should be so done unto me for it were better for me to die than that any man should make my glory void for though i preached the gospel i have nothing to glory of necessity is laid upon me yay woe is unto me if i preached not the gospel in other words he said i have to preach i can't help but preach that's why brother brandon said if you if you're called to preach you're going to preach right and and he told the evangelist that talked about a pulpit he said the world is your pulpit the world is your pulpit because you're going to talk to somebody about the gospel if you're called you're going to do that i would go a little farther say if you're a christian you're going to talk to somebody about the gospel even if it's just your own family but now he says i have nothing to glory of if i preach the gospel for necessity is laid upon me yay woe is unto me if i preach not the gospel i've tried to quit it don't work very well he said for if i do this thing willingly i have a reward but if against my will and dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me what is my reward then verily when i preach the gospel i may make the gospel of christ without charge that i abused not my power in the gospel he's so careful to make sure that the people would have nothing on him they couldn't say he was doing it for money look at that example that he says i don't just say about money but about everything why because he's concerned with the main thing he wants to see souls saved this is paul's self-sacrifice he said i have the power but i don't abuse it brother branham spoke of us arkansas people when he talked about things like this and he said someone offered me here not long ago said brother branham we'll buy you a nice cadillac to ride i said a cadillac i said me go down through arkansas some of them poor little old arkansas down there picking cotton and some of you may have come from families like that and i knew people many people there but ivy church had picked cotton themselves old the elderly they knew what that was like it wasn't a slave thing it was the folks that were there they picked the cotton you live right out there in a little house and a lot of little houses are still there you see the little houses with uh maybe some shingles on the side and holes in the walls and and some people still try to rent those houses we went in one looked at it and it's like man i we couldn't believe they were still trying to rent that thing but i guess somebody would live in it and but that's the kind of people that they were they're poor people very poor people people around here know what poverty is especially those from years past his little mothers with their hands stuck up with cocker birds and things birds off that cotton picking pulling a sack half dead with female trouble and things like that is it eating fat bacon and cornbread for breakfast that actually sounds pretty good he said come put a dollar in my meeting and me riding a cadillac no sir no indeedy he said it no indeed he said i will never do that now again brother branham drove a new ford that the church gave him a brand new ford but you know he's temperate he understands that how this would appear to those people even though brother branham wouldn't have bought it with his own money but just be given to him he said i don't want to do it i'll abuse my power in the gospel first corinthians 9 19 for though i be free from all men i am free from all men he said no one no one has the right to tell me this is what you have to do paul this is way you shouldn't drive a cadillac paul no one has the right to tell me that there's no one higher than the apostle paul in that age no messenger higher than him he said i'm free from all men yet have i made myself servant unto all that i might gain the more god help us to have that kind of an attitude don't you want that kind of an attitude about the gospel lord whatever it takes whatever it takes i'm not i'll you can walk over me you can do whatever you can you can be right i don't care if it can win a soul i'll let you be right go on believe in what you believe if it'll win a soul now we preach the word of god from the pulpit you understand that but i'm not going to argue with you about it that's not my job our job is not an argument our job is to preach the word huh i've made myself a servant unto all means i'm going to treat everybody right i'm going to treat them how i would want to be treated that i might gain the more unto the jews he said i became as a jew that i might gain the jews to them that are under the laws under the law that i might gain them that are under the law listen you have to be careful some people are black and white in their nature they're just black and white i don't mean to pick on the deacons but i've known deacons like that black and white everything's black and white we had a deacon lester's hard to probably watch tonight but or watch it later but we had a deacon that if you had to seat people if you see certain people in certain places you had to see the same that same class of people you had to seat them there too you couldn't take anything else into account well the world's not black and white there's a reason why i don't like people sitting in the back but there's a reason why you sit in the back sometimes i get that i understand that i'd rather you sit right up here on the front row every one of you at least we probably got enough chairs right here on the front for almost everybody on a wednesday night but you know that's me but but there's a reason why you wouldn't do that right we had three of those reasons and sometimes the elderly have a reason there's different reasons why you would you wouldn't do that but man i went off the reservation didn't i but everything's not black and white the same apostle that told the galatians they were traitors to the message of grace if they went back to circumcision went to jerusalem and had timothy circumcised to try to get along with people that hated him and when they found out he was a greek they arrested him anyway and but what is paul doing now if someone had come and told paul you've got to circumcise timothy he wouldn't have done it right but he did it in the interest of trying to get along and we would look that oh you compromised no he didn't no one told him to do it he did it voluntarily you understand he wasn't doing it because it was doing it to fulfill the law the law was nothing law had been done away with right the law was wrapped up in christ but he did it he become a jew to the jews that i might gain the jews he said to them to the under the law as under the law that i might gain them that are under the law you'll find where paul shaved his head for a vow he didn't have to do that that's what the jews did so he did it paul would operate as a jew around the jews because that's what they were he said and he didn't he didn't purposely offend them we didn't have to and yet he would not separate from the gentiles either because he told peter that was wrong now he said to them that are without laws without law being not without law to god so he said i still lived right but under the law to christ that i might gain them that are without law and it's paul's message to the sanhedrin he identifies as a pharisee go and read it he talks to the sanhedrin counselor he says hey it's for the hope of the resurrection i'm called in into question and he's telling the truth but not all of it right but and the pharisees and sadducees rose up against each other then because the sadducees didn't believe in the resurrection but he identified himself as a pharisee but in his sermon on mars hill he quoted dead greek poets and people probably criticized him just like they do today well you quote other people too much and not brother branham enough well i i quote brother branham more than you all is to use one of paul's phrases i probably do but if i have to quote a dead greek poet to win a soul i'll do it are you with me now he said to the weak became as weak that i might gain the weak in other words those that didn't eat meat and wouldn't wouldn't do things on sunday wouldn't wouldn't do things you know they they lived every day they had holy days and things when paul was around him he observed that when he was around the greeks if they ate things offered idols he didn't ask about it he didn't seek it out find out where it came from he says i became weak to the week that i might gain the weak i am made all things to all men that i might by all means if you have your bibles you can underline that all means all means save some you can you can be an instrument in saving somebody by all means i made all things to all men that i might by all means save some if whether it's by helping out at the fellowship hall whether it's by cleaning the church whether it's by helping brother joe has been helping with the with the music and maybe you get out of your position sometimes and uncomfortable but by all all beings all means we're on the internet because of all means i made all things to all men that i might by all means save some he said can the internet be used wrong it is used wrong there's people watching tonight that should be in church probably somewhere i'm not talking about our congregation but other folks that that watch it don't go to church they probably should be in church but you know what by all means but i might by all means save some this is my aim this is my goal he says and i will let nothing distract me from that goal i wonder if we could gather get that kind of an attitude towards the gospel this is the kind of attitude that maybe we once had towards the message whatever it takes to spread the message i think brother robert wilson and and he's going to africa this spring again and trying to get into ghana and and i went to africa with him once and his whole family worked from the time they were little kind of like mine are doing now but they worked and they did uh the websites and different things for him that so he could promote the message and that whole family their whole life they were doctors and lawyers and engineers there in chicago their entire lives was focused on spreading the gospel every thought every time you were around them it was what can we do to get this message into a place where it's not been thank god for that somebody's got to do that and not everybody can do that all the time but if you can't you can support somebody who does right it's my aim it's my goal i don't want to let nothing distract me from that goal see i could i could go over here and i could live a certain way that would be in my right my freedom remember paul has just got done talking about how those eight things that were sacrificed to idols and they used abuse their freedom he says i could do that but i will let nothing distract me from my goal of winning souls and if i have to give up a little bit if i have to give up a little money if i have to give up a little prestige whatever it takes let me let them talk about me if they want to but i'm going to win a soul to christ that's my goal that's what i want that's my desire we're living in a time when that's hard we don't have to see as many baptisms as we used to i watch my brothers overseas but then i get a little bit jealous sometimes you watch them they're still baptizing people every week every week i've got friends overseas that baptize people and we look around here and you think you just don't baptize people that often but if there's one if there's one if there's one person you say well how do you know that there is one maybe there's not well you weren't always a christian our kids aren't born christians they have they have to give their hearts to christ they have to receive the holy ghost they have to be baptized and so by all means that's my aim it's my goal i want to read some brother brown said this in desperation he said on the lamb's book of life i want my name wrote i want him to remember me when the roll call he said and it throws me into desperation that is like paul said after i have preached the gospel shall i be a stowaway shall be a cast off he said it could happen so it throws me into a desperate stage desperation to think of after all these years of preaching he said could i a place come where i could fail him what's the next move what must i do next he said and it throws me into a nervous stage and what can i do he said it throws me to the mountains and to the valleys he said it's hard because when i'm with the people i've got to be all things to all men that i might win some to christ yet with that token always before me he's desperate he wants to do the right thing see but but yet he's got to he understands when he's around the people he's got to be all things to all men so when he's at home sometimes he's got to put on an apron help do the dishes all things to all men that by all means i might read some brother branham uses that and talks about hunting he says sometimes hunting a person has a similar interest you talk about hunting all things to all men that i might reach some huh maybe you go to a car auction maybe you go to a livestock auction maybe you may be around people at work but all things oh man you're looking for that opportunity to talk to somebody about jesus because you know they're not gonna make it not in this age you're not gonna make it without him god help us yet with that token he said always before me so we don't we don't transgress in that we don't we don't go down to the bar and sit in the bar room and talk to the drunks because that would be the wrong place we don't go on their grounds but whenever we have opportunity we're all things to all men we might reach some and paul says in verse 23 this i do for the gospel's sake that i might be partaker thereof with you the great scottish preacher alexander mclaren said said it this way he said we can do no good by standing on a height and fleeing down the gospel to the people below they must feel that we enter into their circumstances prejudices ways of thinking and the like if our words are to have power he said that is true about all christian teachers whether of old or young you must be a boy among boys and try to show that you enter into the boy's nature or you may lecture till doomsday and do no good that's true i watch that with young people for years we run that that youth banquet at brother ivy's and i watched that over the years that the young people and preachers would come in and you know us message preachers have convenient ways of doing things and we're used to being in the back nobody bothering us come out here and preach and at the banquet we have a lot of fun we had a lot of fun and then we would have a few songs and go into the message but you know what it did it relaxed the young people it was we were being all things to all people that we might reach some and alexander mclaren said you can't stand and fling the gospel from the heights you've got to enter into a boy's nature or you can lecture till doomsday and do no good verse 24 know you not that they which run on a race run all one receiveth the prize so run that you may obtain don't you want to obtain don't you want to reach that goal he said to run you can't reach that goal sitting still there's got to be something in there church there's got to be some desire on the inside of it but david i want to reach it i'm pressing toward that goal paul says i pressed toward the mark of the high calling in christ there's got to be a hunger there and i got troubled by it in my mind today because i don't see that hunger everywhere i don't see i look forward to every service not just because i'm a preacher i want to be with the in the house of god because i've seen miracles happen in the house of god but it seems like people take any excuse they can take to to be out of the house of god and i don't understand it because there's got to be a hunger there if we're going to see something from god there's got to be a desire on the inside to reach reaching out for that mark if you want to reach the goal if you want to obtain run i mean to yell at you just a a few of us here tonight but run that you may obtain you want to obtain you want to achieve a goal you say well i've gotten older i've kind of rested on what i did back in the past no run that you may obtain run put some effort in it you can tell if somebody puts an effort into it put some effort into it run that you may obtain he said and every man there's trivis for the mastery it's temperate in all things he showed them his own temperance when it comes to money when it comes to having a family he said every man that striveth for the master is tempered in all things he said no they do it to obtain a corruptable crown but we are incorruptable i therefore so run not as uncertainly so in other words i'm not just in a days running around wondering where i'm going i know what i'm what my goal is i know where the finish line is what i thought we in this stage we can say that more than ever the rapture that shouts already went out we've already heard the message of the hour i run not uncertainly i don't just beat the air i fight i'm not shadow boxing i'm fighting against the enemy because i know there's a goal right in front of me and this is the age that'll reach it do you believe that tonight church this is the age that i'm reaching i run not as one that beateth the air i fight and i just want to be the fear but i keep under my body and bring it into subjection unless that by any means when i preach to my when i preach to others i myself should be a castaway word is disapproved not that he would be lost but that he would be disapproved before god for his ministry he said i keep under my body bring it into subjection god help us today i i'm temperate i don't always reply i don't always the way i want to i don't respond in hurt to people that hurt me they said about jesus peter said when he was reviled he reviled not again i keep my my temper and i keep my tongue and temperance and meekness i'm not just saying that about me but that's what paul's saying he said i do that because i'm reaching i'm reaching for a goal i want to reach that goal i don't want to get in by the skin of my teeth why do we preach you ever thought about that well number one as paul says he says woe unto me if i don't preach the gospel i if you can get by you say well i'm a preacher but i'm just not going to preach i'll let somebody else preach if you can get by with that go ahead but for me and i don't say you have to have a pulpit to preach you preach out on the street if you have to but you preach somewhere for me i have to preach i could have someone else stand here but this is my opportunity to present the gospel to you why do i preach because there's a goal and there's a certain amount of ability that i have and no more i can't make myself a better preacher in that sense i can study i can work i can lose weight there's a lot of things i can do but i can't i can't just give myself a better gift does that make sense can't do it and there's some men that have a gift that only feed five people some have gifts to feed hundreds thousands some only have a gift to talk to just somebody on the street but it's still a gift and to use that gift but their award told me years ago and i've always i pondered this over and over he said he said if you're nothing but a 10-cent preacher he said you only give god five cents you stole five cents from god and maybe others are dollar preachers you look at them and get discouraged and say well if i'm not gonna be like that i might as well just not do it no run that you may obtain keep under my body bring it into subjection unless by any means when i preach to others i myself should be a castaway why do we preach we preach because of the goal why did jesus endure the suffering that he that he did he said for the joy that was set before him amen what joy was that fellowship with you fellowship with me brother bill it what joy that was his joy he wanted to fellowship with us so for the joy that was set before him he endured the cross despising the shame amen brother brown says this and beyond the curtain of time he said the voice spoke to me you know it was written in the bible that the prophets were gathered with their people i said yes i remember that in the scriptures but there are not this many brahms voice replied these are not brahms these are your converts the ones you've led to the lord some of these women you think are so young and beautiful were more than 90 years old when you led them to the lord no wonder they're crying out my precious brother don't you think it'll be worth it when you get there maybe that person you talk to in the street maybe that person maybe it's the money you sent overseas or something that helped and that person will will be there because of that and maybe because that person you talk to maybe some of you met down at the at the garage or the filling station or whatever that it was you realize what satan's doing today he's making it to where no one actually meets anybody all you fellowship with is what's on facebook and that isn't even real and it's i love being able to contact with people on that but you can't fellowship with somebody's spirit on there you fellowship with what they present right and here when i'm talking to you i can fellowship with you spirits we fellowship with one another right i can see your face i can see if you're mad at me if you're happy right i can see it some of you some of you i can't tell i'll learn one of these days but but that can you you can usually tell by people's faces what's going on whether they're listening you ever you know how it's same thing for a preacher is this when you're talking to somebody you know if they're listening or not all right most of the time if you're not looking at somebody you're not listening it's true and so and i've got a bad habit of doing that because you'll be talking to me and suddenly my mind will drift and i'll turn away and i've gotten in trouble for that before mostly from my wife but from other people too because if i'm not careful my mind will drift and i'll i'll think of something else i might walk away but if i'm really paying attention i'm looking at you and there's the faces that you can fellowship with the people satan's trying to take that away from us that personal fellowship but i think we should take every opportunity to spread the gospel in that way huh listen what they told brother brown said no wonder they're crying out my precious brother so you might see him there that person that you reach for the gospel he said then the multitude cried together if you hadn't gone forth with the gospel we wouldn't be here you say brother ben explain that to me how that works with predestination i can't explain that but he said it god the same god that predestinated the person to receive the gospel predestinated the one to preach it right he said if you hadn't gone forth with the gospel we wouldn't be here will there be anybody on that day i'd like to encourage you with this brother branham said that he said whenever you pray or send money or participate in some way in missions or something like that i'm paraphrasing but he says your name will always be associated with the souls that are won [Laughter] i don't want my name's never gonna be on anything they ain't gonna put my name on this church when i'm gone at the lord terry's it won't it won't have my name the memorial auditorium but i'll tell you this i want my name associated with some souls don't you would you want your name associated with some souls even if it was just a penny that you had to give but you gave it even if it was just i'm not trying to get your money but you understand i want you to be encouraged by that no wonder they're crying out my precious brother and the multitude cried out if you hadn't gone forth with the gospel we wouldn't be here thank the lord somebody will be there because of us there's a story that brother branham told about a magic flower and he told it i think in the message come follow me to some young people always struck me he said it was like a fairy tale he said a magic flower he said a man found a magic flower and the flower said if you'll keep me with you all the time wherever you go said i whatever you ask you can have that's a pretty powerful thing isn't it so they went to he said okay he said i need some money he said why don't you open that mountain show me all the gold all the diamonds everything that's in that mountain and so they went to the mountain the mountain opened up side of the mountain opened up and here they walk inside and there's gold there's silver there's jewels a man walks in he lays the flower on a rock and he walks over and grabs some gold and says i'm gonna go show them what i got here show the people look look what i got i'll be rich the rest of my life he starts to go out and the flower says don't forget the main thing so he run back in he got some silver and some gold and put it together and said i'll show him just how how many riches are here and starts to run back out and the fire says don't forget the main thing the third time brother brown said he got a piece of the rock the mountain was made out of he said we'll analyze it see what kind it is so we'll always be able to find the mountain that's why some people are today well we'll go through it and just just we'll understand it intellectually he start grabbed it and he started to leave with it and the flower said for the last time don't forget the main thing he says oh shut up he walks out the door and the mountain closes behind him the main thing was the flower why are we here the main thing is jesus christ and we our purpose here is to bring souls to the kingdom of god to reach souls for christ let's not forget the main thing we get so busy and i talk about that all the time we're having meetings this weekend i'm closed in just a moment but we're having meetings this weekend and i talk all the time about this but it just strikes me that when brother branham talked about the prostitute woman that come in and wash jesus speech you remember the story brother brahm tells the story he said that the pharisees were so busy with religious things that they didn't notice that he'd come in they didn't pay any attention to the fact that he was there and he was the main thing he was the main thing then he says this he said you asked him you invited him to come then worship him when he comes let's not let's not push him aside and rush through the service and rush back out let's remember the main things what is our life without god it's nothing what are all these things we spend all this time on without god nothing let's not forget the main thing let's bow our heads together lord jesus what could we do without you we couldn't live the bible says in you we live we couldn't breathe as the bible says that we breathe in you we live and we breathe we have our being lord we want to refocus tonight on the main thing to lay aside every weight if we can have to be temperate lord as paul was and in this chapter in corinthians and it just so struck me my heart is stirred tonight lord give us that hunger for souls i found where your prophet said this one of the main signs of the church has the holy ghost is full of the holy ghost is when they're reaching for souls and he said he said in one place that if the if if no one would come and pray with those that come and pray he said then ichabod is written across the door oh god give us a hunger give us a thirst for righteousness lord a hunger to bring souls into the kingdom of god a desire lord of heart bring back the new lord if we've lost it somehow just that hunger that we have for your word that desire that we want to be in the house of god maybe we still come but it's just become a duty oh god help us tonight it's so easy to get used to just laying out so easy to get used to
