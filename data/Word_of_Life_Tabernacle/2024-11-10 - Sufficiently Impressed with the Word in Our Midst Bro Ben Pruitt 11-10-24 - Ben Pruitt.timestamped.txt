[40:04] flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld
[40:08] his glory the glory as of the only
[40:10] begotten of the father full of grace and
[40:14] truth and then I want to go to Luke
[40:15] chapter 4 and verse 16 you just bear
[40:19] with me for a moment also going to have
[40:21] a a baby dedication tonight uh the
[40:24] little Andrew's baby's going to be
[40:25] dedicated this afternoon I believe it's
[40:27] still at the schedule so we're looking
[40:29] forward to that uh Dustin Fel it's good
[40:32] to see you this morning they're going to
[40:33] be married on Saturday so if y'all I'm
[40:36] sure can make it to that I'm sure you'd
[40:38] be welcome I think there's an invitation
[40:40] there in the back good to have them with
[40:43] us today Luke 4:16 he came to Nazareth
[40:46] where he had been brought up and as his
[40:48] custom was he went into the synagogue on
[40:51] the Sabbath day and stood up for to read
[40:54] and there was delivered unto him the
[40:55] book of the prophet Isaiah and when he
[40:57] had opened the book he found the place
[40:59] where it was written the spirit of the
[41:00] Lord is upon me because Heath anointed
[41:03] me to preach the gospel to the poor he
[41:05] has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to
[41:07] preach Deliverance to the captives
[41:09] recovering of sight to the blind to set
[41:11] at Liberty them that are bruised to
[41:14] preach the acceptable year of the Lord
[41:18] and he closed the book and he gave it
[41:19] again to the minister and sat down and
[41:22] the eyes of all of them that were in the
[41:24] synagogue were fastened on him and and
[41:27] begin to say unto them this day is this
[41:30] scripture fulfilled in your ears now
[41:34] brother Brandon when he uses that in
[41:35] this day the scripture is fulfilled he
[41:37] says this he said now we want to draw
[41:39] from that a conclusion of how Dynamic is
[41:44] the word of God oh I just love that how
[41:48] Dynamic is the word of God pray the Lord
[41:52] would add his Blessing to the word you
[41:53] may be seated
[41:58] when Jesus identifies himself in
[42:00] Revelation chap 2 to the pergan church
[42:04] age he identifies himself as one who had
[42:06] the sharp sword with two edges a sharp
[42:10] sword with two edges and and Revelation
[42:13] 2:12 these things saith he which hath
[42:16] the sharp sword with two edges we know
[42:19] that's the word Hebrews 4 and12 says for
[42:22] the word of God is quick how many know
[42:24] what quick means quick means alive the
[42:27] word of God is alive you don't have to
[42:30] make it alive but the word is alive it
[42:35] is alive and Powerful it is powerful
[42:40] it's the nature of the word to be both
[42:42] alive and powerful and sharper than any
[42:46] two-edged sword piercing even to the
[42:48] dividing of under of Soul and Spirit of
[42:51] the joints and Marrow and is a discerner
[42:54] of the thoughts and intents of the heart
[42:57] so the word is alive it is powerful and
[43:00] it is a discerner in Ephesians 6:17 it
[43:03] says you take the helmet of salvation
[43:05] and the sword of the spirit the sword of
[43:09] the spirit which is the word of God in
[43:13] Revelation 19 we find him coming back on
[43:15] a white horse and I believe that'll
[43:17] happen one day I believe we're going to
[43:19] be following him on a white horse that's
[43:22] what the Bible says I can't totally
[43:23] explain that but I believe it's going to
[43:25] happen and so
[43:27] uh it tells us that that's what's going
[43:29] to take place this is after the Rapture
[43:32] in the marriage supper and it says it
[43:34] says he was clothed with a vesture
[43:36] dipped in Blood and his name is called
[43:40] the word of God someone say it with me
[43:43] the word of God his name is called the
[43:47] word of God Revelation 19:15 out of his
[43:50] mouth goeth a sharp sword that with it
[43:53] he should Smite the Nations he shall
[43:55] rule them with a rod of fire and he
[43:57] treadeth The Wine Press of the
[43:58] fierceness and Wrath of almighty God and
[44:01] I want to what I want to bring to you
[44:03] today is are we sufficiently
[44:06] impressed with the word of God in our
[44:09] midst today are we sufficiently
[44:12] impressed with that word I want you to
[44:15] hold on to that thought now brother
[44:16] brandom says we can see his association
[44:19] with the word he is the word that's who
[44:22] he is the word in his name in John 1:1
[44:26] it says in the beginning was the word he
[44:27] said the root from which we get our
[44:29] translation for word is
[44:31] logos and I want you to remember that
[44:33] this morning logos which means the
[44:35] thought or
[44:36] concept it has the double meaning of
[44:38] thought and speech now a thought
[44:40] expressed is a word or words isn't that
[44:43] wonderful and beautiful John says the
[44:45] concept of God was expressed in Jesus
[44:50] random goes on to ask the question are
[44:51] we sufficiently impressed with that word
[44:55] are we sufficiently impressed with the
[44:57] logos the expression of God in our midst
[45:01] I want to ask you that this morning are
[45:03] we sufficiently impressed with the logos
[45:07] with the word in our midst or are we uh
[45:10] are we sufficiently impressed or are we
[45:13] uh are we waiting on something else to
[45:16] happen or someone else to come or
[45:18] something else to catch our attention
[45:21] Brother Bruce is it possible that we
[45:24] already have what we need our attention
[45:26] should already be caught by the one
[45:29] who's in our midst who is the word and I
[45:32] want to tell you this morning he's not
[45:34] just there when everybody's there or
[45:35] it's a big meeting or or a large
[45:38] congregation but he's there this he's
[45:40] here this morning he is the word in our
[45:43] midst how many believe that today he is
[45:46] the word here today and if the word is
[45:49] here then the power is here the spirit
[45:52] is here and are we sufficiently
[45:54] impressed with that that's the
[45:58] question oh my impressed means to affect
[46:02] especially forcibly or deeply to gain
[46:06] the admiration of or the interest of I
[46:10] want to challenge you I want to
[46:11] challenge you young people are you
[46:13] impressed are you are you does it have
[46:16] your
[46:17] attention is the word something that you
[46:20] can just take or leave or is it a
[46:22] reality in your life is it something
[46:25] that uh that that that you live by is it
[46:29] something that you boy you you still you
[46:31] would make a mistake and and I know many
[46:33] of us we make mistakes all of us do
[46:35] because we're human beings but when you
[46:37] make a mistake what do you do if the
[46:39] word if you have a a sufficient
[46:41] impression of the word what happens
[46:43] immediately you'll go back and say Lord
[46:45] I didn't mean to do that I know that's
[46:47] not what the word says to do so it would
[46:50] just about kill you to cross that
[46:53] word and that's where we need to be and
[46:56] it goes with what we're going to talk
[46:58] about this afternoon but but there's a
[47:00] there's something about a holy ghost
[47:02] filled Christian that the word becomes
[47:05] Dynamics to you when you believe it and
[47:08] when you receive it when you hear it it
[47:11] actually becomes alive to you are you
[47:13] with me this morning it actually begins
[47:16] to affect you in a in a real
[47:19] way oh my so the word is not just
[47:22] something brother random said on a tape
[47:25] it's not just something that the
[47:27] preacher says on Sunday morning it's not
[47:29] just the printed letter but it's
[47:32] something that lives it's something
[47:34] that's alive and
[47:36] powerful and able to take care of our
[47:40] needs has the word affected us
[47:45] deeply right and and in the message I
[47:50] know people sometimes have a hard time
[47:52] understanding message people because you
[47:54] say well you live your life by Co code
[47:57] of conduct and you do things maybe you
[47:59] make you different from the world why do
[48:01] we do that we don't do that because
[48:02] we're forced
[48:03] to right or we
[48:06] shouldn't right we don't do that because
[48:08] some Pastor beats us over the head with
[48:10] it right you you sisters dress the way
[48:12] that you do and and you don't do that
[48:14] because I'm up here constantly just
[48:16] telling you you better do this or I
[48:18] might see you at the Walmart and and you
[48:20] know I don't do that but why do you do
[48:23] the way you do because you've been
[48:26] impressed bled by the
[48:28] word and it's something that God wants
[48:31] it's something that oh church it's
[48:33] something that God wants and so there's
[48:35] an impression there and and we got to
[48:37] reach a place of maturity in our life
[48:39] that we will not cross the word no
[48:41] matter what we feel like no matter what
[48:43] we see coming no matter what happens in
[48:45] our lives we will not cross the word I'm
[48:48] not going to keep my own ideas I'm not
[48:50] going to give it my own twist I'm going
[48:52] to believe what the word
[48:55] says are you with me
[48:58] now and this this message this morning
[49:01] and I don't want to belabor the point
[49:03] but it's impressed deeply on me and God
[49:07] put it in my heart and I asked myself
[49:09] the question am I sufficiently impressed
[49:12] with the word and I want to ask you that
[49:15] question as well and only you can answer
[49:18] that question does it have our
[49:22] interest and and it begs the question
[49:24] what should we be impressed by
[49:28] right because we we are impressed many
[49:30] times by by loud
[49:33] things and flashy
[49:36] things and big
[49:39] things but the word when he came wasn't
[49:43] big wasn't
[49:45] flashy wasn't loud but he was
[49:51] powerful the most powerful thing that
[49:54] was ever in the Earth was
[49:57] Jesus right brother the most powerful
[49:59] sermon that was ever preached was
[50:01] preached sitting on a
[50:03] rock right Jesus preached it blessed are
[50:07] the peacemakers Blessed blessed are you
[50:09] and menual reval you what was it the
[50:11] most gracious words ever proceeded from
[50:13] the mouth of a man was when he just read
[50:15] the word and began to tell him this day
[50:17] this scripture is fulfilled right are we
[50:21] impressed with that are we impressed
[50:24] with who God is cuz he is the word in St
[50:29] John 1 he said in the beginning was the
[50:31] word and the Word was God and the Word
[50:32] was made flesh and dwelt Among Us God
[50:35] unfolding himself down to a human
[50:39] being right oh that's a great that's a
[50:42] great thing he said now watch how he did
[50:45] it this is in questions answers on
[50:47] Genesis in 1953 brother Ron was so far
[50:50] ahead of his time he he he's watching
[50:53] here we got people that were
[50:54] trinitarians and mostly and and and and
[50:57] Oneness or whatever that they were but
[50:59] they didn't have an understanding like
[51:00] this but this was a prophet of God he
[51:03] said now watch how he did it now back
[51:05] there when this little Halo comes he
[51:07] said now we can't see nothing yet but
[51:10] just by eyes of Supernatural we see a a
[51:13] Halo the brand calls it a white light a
[51:16] a little if we can imagine a a pillar of
[51:19] fire say little Halo standing there he
[51:22] said no that's the Son of God the logos
[51:26] he said I can see him playing around
[51:27] like a little child before the father's
[51:29] door with all eternity see he said now
[51:32] then in his imaginary makeup or in his
[51:36] thoughts and what he's thinking he begin
[51:38] to think of what things would be I can
[51:40] hear him say let there be
[51:43] light now you talk about a powerful
[51:46] thing right nothing
[51:49] exists and the word that little light
[51:53] that come from God that was God that was
[51:56] in the beginning with God that little
[51:59] light that's in you this
[52:01] morning by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[52:04] are you with me now that little light
[52:07] was church that little light was so
[52:11] powerful when he spoke that he spoke and
[52:14] the worlds were
[52:16] framed Oh my he said let there be light
[52:20] and Light Came brother brandom goes into
[52:23] that how it happened now he he made all
[52:26] things the Bible says no man has seen
[52:28] God at any time only begotten son which
[52:30] is in the bosom of the father he hath
[52:32] declared him and he's the one as we read
[52:35] earlier that made all things that was uh
[52:37] brother Bram said that was called by
[52:38] Bible readers the logos or the
[52:41] anointing as I was going to say the part
[52:43] of God begin to develop into something
[52:45] so human beings could have some type of
[52:47] an idea what it was because you can't
[52:49] comprehend eloh
[52:51] him right he just just incomprehensible
[52:54] it's impossible
[52:56] right but then God
[52:58] would he would he would condescend down
[53:02] into something a part of God which was
[53:05] the fullness of God because God's not
[53:08] diminished by by transforming
[53:12] himself and so this part of God becomes
[53:15] the fullness of God but it's the Son of
[53:18] God but it's something we could we could
[53:20] tell what it
[53:22] was right it began to develop into
[53:24] something so human beings could have
[53:25] some type of idea what it was he said it
[53:28] was a little low a little light moving
[53:30] he said that was the word of God I want
[53:33] you to notice he said it was the
[53:35] anointing but it was the
[53:37] word right so in the
[53:40] beginning the word was not a dead letter
[53:43] it was never a dead letter it was the
[53:45] anointing was the word and the Word was
[53:49] the
[53:51] anointing come on it's the same one who
[53:54] brooded over the Earth
[53:56] yes sir right the Earth was without form
[53:59] and void and darkness was upon the face
[54:01] of the deep and the spirit of God moved
[54:05] that word moved is is brooded fluttered
[54:09] as as Deuteronomy says he fluttered
[54:11] Wings it's the same word he flutters
[54:13] over uh his young the same word is it's
[54:15] the moving of of the of the eagle in the
[54:18] nest it's the movement of of the Holy
[54:21] Spirit the spirit of God so the
[54:24] anointing of God is the word of God is
[54:27] the spirit of
[54:29] God right I know this is got a little
[54:32] depth this morning but I just want you
[54:34] to hold on to it and you young people
[54:35] don't don't lose interest because
[54:37] there's something here for you as well I
[54:38] believe we can all understand
[54:40] this he was God the logos the word that
[54:44] went out of God when it began to brood
[54:47] upon the Earth and it brought forth
[54:48] marine life when the spirit of God the
[54:51] logos the
[54:53] word right which God said let there be
[54:56] in there went the logos which is the
[54:58] word so he brooded over botney life he
[55:01] brooded over animal life and he finally
[55:03] brooded over human life until he made it
[55:05] in his own image but he said that man fa
[55:09] like the seed has to fall and then God
[55:11] be to Bro over that after the fall he
[55:14] brought up an Enoch he brought up an
[55:16] Elijah he brought up a Moses he brought
[55:18] up Prophet after Prophet trying to
[55:19] restore that image again and finally
[55:22] upon the Earth came the genuine image of
[55:24] God himself again which was God the
[55:26] logos made flesh and dwelt Among Us he
[55:31] said now that same logos has a part he's
[55:33] got a bride and the same logos I love
[55:36] this this word that cannot be tampered
[55:39] with sir is amen brooding over the
[55:44] churches today trying to bring back the
[55:47] word to its full manifestation what's he
[55:51] doing here this morning what what's your
[55:53] purpose of coming to the house of God
[55:55] are we sufficiently impressed with that
[55:57] that the same Holy Spirit the same logos
[56:00] the same word the same anointing that
[56:02] was there before time where there was
[56:04] nothing but Caleb and it began to form
[56:07] itself into something at the word of God
[56:10] that same word is the word that we have
[56:13] this
[56:14] morning the word that's in our
[56:18] lips Church the word that's in our
[56:21] hearts young people you don't have to
[56:23] struggle and always be overcome and
[56:25] always say well I just have to give in
[56:27] this and give into that no the word is
[56:29] in
[56:31] you we don't have to give in with our
[56:33] families we don't have to give up and
[56:35] say well well it's just going to be like
[56:37] that the rest of our lives we're always
[56:38] going to be that way no we don't have to
[56:40] do that we've got the word inside of it
[56:42] you say well I've been seeking the
[56:43] baptism of the Holy Ghost and it just
[56:45] seems like it never comes but the word
[56:47] it wants he's brooding over you he wants
[56:49] to give it to you more than you want it
[56:52] today the word is giving you life
[56:59] just imagine him this morning think
[57:02] about it sometimes we just got to put it
[57:03] in a way that we can see
[57:07] it that
[57:11] light the same
[57:14] one had his picture taken with brother
[57:18] brandom that
[57:20] light is here this
[57:23] morning say how do you know that because
[57:25] I brought with me you brought him with
[57:28] you right that light which is the
[57:32] powerful word the anointing the the holy
[57:36] spirit is here and and um you say
[57:40] brother Ben you're mixing up all those
[57:41] terms I'm doing that on
[57:43] purpose because I think sometimes we we
[57:46] dwell too much on a separation between
[57:48] the word and the
[57:50] spirit when the fullness of the word is
[57:52] there it's never without the shikina
[57:55] amen
[57:56] it's just the shakina is there the only
[57:59] time that the word become a dead letter
[58:02] was when they added Creeds to it and the
[58:05] shakina was missing from the temple and
[58:08] the Word was missing from its place
[58:10] that's the only time it become dead was
[58:12] when the either they either the word was
[58:15] was not there or was handled with
[58:17] unclean hands or something else took
[58:19] place that was never a moment if the
[58:21] word was actually there that the spirit
[58:23] didn't honor that word right oh church
[58:27] this morning if we want to have Revival
[58:29] we got to preach the word if we want to
[58:31] have God me in our midst we got to
[58:33] preach the word if you want to have a
[58:35] home life that that's what God wants it
[58:37] to be you can go to meeting after
[58:38] meeting and seek everything that you can
[58:40] find but I'll tell you what'll change
[58:42] your home life I'll tell you what it'll
[58:44] change the atmosphere around your home
[58:46] is if you begin to repeat the word and
[58:48] you begin to speak the word and you
[58:50] begin to live the
[58:54] word I say what word should I speak well
[58:56] the
[58:57] Bible the message of the
[59:00] hour right which is the light on the
[59:02] Bible we shouldn't be afraid of any of
[59:05] it should speak
[59:08] it we should hear it but we should speak
[59:12] it see this word that cannot be tampered
[59:16] with is brooding over the churches
[59:18] today Matthew 18 and 20 says where two
[59:22] or three are gathered together in my
[59:23] name there am I in the midst of them
[59:27] in John 14:20 he said at that day
[59:29] brother brandom taught us that was this
[59:31] day shall you know you shall know that I
[59:34] am in my father and ye in me and I in
[59:38] you brother BR said today he is standing
[59:42] Among Us in the person of the Holy Ghost
[59:46] manifesting himself uh more and more
[59:50] coming into his church making himself
[59:53] known because him and the bride and the
[59:56] groom will be the same making himself
[59:59] known and one day oh I believe we'll see
[1:00:01] him in the flesh one day one day you'll
[1:00:04] see that one that you felt in your heart
[1:00:06] and see his identification and will
[1:00:08] become personalized before you and then
[1:00:11] you and he are one you've United by the
[1:00:14] word and the Word was in the beginning
[1:00:16] we go back to the beginning which is God
[1:00:19] and that day you'll know that I'm in the
[1:00:21] Father the father and me I and you and
[1:00:22] you and me he said Hallelujah listen
[1:00:24] we're here
[1:00:27] and if you go back and listen to that
[1:00:28] brother BR gets really excited when he's
[1:00:30] preaching he said we're here you can
[1:00:32] hear the emotion in his voice we're here
[1:00:35] oh Church oh I want to declare to you
[1:00:38] today not because I said it but a
[1:00:39] prophet of God stood and declared it and
[1:00:41] the word declares it to you where two or
[1:00:44] three are gathered together in my name
[1:00:45] I'll be in the midst thereof where are
[1:00:47] we gathered in his name in the place the
[1:00:49] only God's only provided place of
[1:00:51] worship we're gathered together in
[1:00:53] Christ Jesus and when we are gathered
[1:00:55] together what are we doing we're
[1:00:56] declaring the word we're becoming the
[1:00:58] word what is he doing he's saying I'm in
[1:01:01] you and you in
[1:01:02] me Hallelujah he said I'm so glad to see
[1:01:05] him personifying himself right Among Us
[1:01:09] and see what he promised for the word he
[1:01:13] said not what somebody's emotion singing
[1:01:15] and jumping and dancing but by his word
[1:01:18] he is making himself known and you know
[1:01:22] I I want to I want to add this because
[1:01:24] we're not a a real emot otal church but
[1:01:26] I'll say I I love emotion I love the
[1:01:29] word you you all know me I've been
[1:01:31] around you long enough the way I back a
[1:01:32] preacher is the way I've always backed
[1:01:34] to preachers since I was a kid I I enjoy
[1:01:37] the word of God I enjoy the presence of
[1:01:39] God I enjoy getting free and seeing
[1:01:41] people be free to worship God whatever
[1:01:43] way that God strikes their heart I enjoy
[1:01:46] that but but it's not the jumping or the
[1:01:48] dancing or the shouting that's not what
[1:01:50] we preach we preach the
[1:01:52] word we preach the word why because the
[1:01:55] word is making himself
[1:01:57] know when they brought built the temple
[1:02:00] and brought the ark into it God went in
[1:02:02] there brother BR said with a pillar of
[1:02:04] fire this this is a great type he said
[1:02:07] amen he said it was David jumping and
[1:02:09] screaming it was all the singers in the
[1:02:11] priest carrying on when they was out of
[1:02:13] the will of God so it had the same kind
[1:02:16] of
[1:02:17] Revival they danced when it came back
[1:02:20] wrong and when it come back right they
[1:02:23] sing when it come back wrong and when it
[1:02:24] come back right same kind of
[1:02:27] Revival right but the first time it was
[1:02:29] David doing it that's what he said it
[1:02:32] was David jumping and screaming it was
[1:02:35] the singers it was the priests carrying
[1:02:37] on when they was out of the will of God
[1:02:40] but when God identified the Ark in his
[1:02:44] place and position remember when it come
[1:02:47] into the temple he said before they
[1:02:49] could get the Ark in there here come the
[1:02:51] pillar of fire leading the
[1:02:53] way oh church that's the kind of worship
[1:02:56] that we want that's the kind of church
[1:02:58] that we want we want the lost the
[1:03:00] powerful word of God to lead the way
[1:03:03] into our worship be the one who leads
[1:03:06] our singing and our dancing and our
[1:03:07] clapping and everything else Lord may
[1:03:09] you
[1:03:12] lead that's why if you're going to play
[1:03:14] music in the church you need to live
[1:03:16] right if you're going to preach in the
[1:03:18] church you need to live right if you're
[1:03:21] going to whatever I'm put myself there
[1:03:22] too if you're going to be a deacon you
[1:03:24] need to live right if you're going to be
[1:03:26] a Christian you need to live right why
[1:03:28] because we want the pillar of fire to
[1:03:30] lead the way we're not up here just to
[1:03:32] make a show we're not here just to mail
[1:03:34] it in or have another service we're here
[1:03:36] to see the anointing of God the same
[1:03:39] powerful word that was here in the
[1:03:40] beginning come back again and come back
[1:03:42] and change lives oh we need that church
[1:03:45] don't we need lives to be changed some
[1:03:47] of y'all know what that is some of y'all
[1:03:49] your lives were recently changed you
[1:03:50] know what it is you know that the word
[1:03:52] can change you I think some of us need
[1:03:54] to be we need to realize we don't just
[1:03:56] get changed when we're born again we
[1:03:58] continue to be changed from glory to
[1:04:00] glory we need to be changed this morning
[1:04:02] attitudes need to be taken away
[1:04:04] ungodliness needs to be taken out our
[1:04:06] thoughts need to be changed we need to
[1:04:08] be made closer to God we need to be
[1:04:10] brought all the way into the presence of
[1:04:12] God how will we do that when the pillar
[1:04:14] of fire leads the
[1:04:19] way if if the Revival's not led by this
[1:04:23] message which is the the word of of God
[1:04:27] right if the message is not in the
[1:04:28] Forefront of the Revival it's not a true
[1:04:33] Revival are you with me
[1:04:37] now y'all going to have to forgive me
[1:04:39] today I just feel
[1:04:42] it and I know it's
[1:04:46] true he said it found it found a resting
[1:04:49] place and the glory of God was in there
[1:04:53] till they couldn't even see how to
[1:04:54] minister brother brand said it'll close
[1:04:57] the eyes of every Theologian when he
[1:05:00] comes for his
[1:05:01] bride oh don't you want that kind of
[1:05:04] atmosphere around you if you want that
[1:05:06] kind of atmosphere believe the word live
[1:05:09] the word take the
[1:05:13] word he said she'll be taken up in the
[1:05:15] middle of the night as it was to them
[1:05:17] they won't even see her go said oh
[1:05:20] praise be to God Amen see the word is
[1:05:23] here brother random taught us he is here
[1:05:26] but he's in spirit form I love this he
[1:05:29] said this is him you see in the picture
[1:05:33] see it's he the Lord the logos the angel
[1:05:36] of the Covenant and he's
[1:05:38] standing present amen again in 1962 he
[1:05:43] said but this is my Ministry to declare
[1:05:47] him that he is
[1:05:51] here oh my
[1:06:00] brother BR said think of it the same
[1:06:01] Pillar of Fire that come upon those men
[1:06:03] that wrote the Bible is the same Pillar
[1:06:05] of Fire here today do we really believe
[1:06:09] that church say well it was there when
[1:06:11] brother brandham was there but the
[1:06:12] pillar of fire didn't leave brother Bram
[1:06:15] taught us that right I can show you
[1:06:17] where he taught us that he taught us
[1:06:18] that the pillar of fire when Joshua came
[1:06:21] it became a person you say Well it
[1:06:23] become a person who did it become the
[1:06:24] bride
[1:06:26] right it's manifested son of man is
[1:06:28] manifested in the bride now where he was
[1:06:30] manifested in one man not a part of the
[1:06:33] bride and he was manifested in Christ
[1:06:35] being the fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:06:38] but he said how we thank him for that he
[1:06:40] said he's here today interpreting the
[1:06:42] Bible I'm so glad to be identified in
[1:06:44] that I don't know what to do he said I'd
[1:06:47] rather be ident identified in that than
[1:06:49] all the Baptist Methodist Presbyterian
[1:06:51] Lutheran and all the rest of them I
[1:06:54] think we need to get proud I think we
[1:06:55] need to get you know everybody's so
[1:06:56] excited the ones who won about who they
[1:06:58] voted for in the
[1:07:00] election and sad to say the the
[1:07:03] prohibition party didn't win so it's
[1:07:06] kind of bummed about that but you know
[1:07:08] if you voted for the right for the party
[1:07:10] that won you're like well you know I
[1:07:13] kind of tell people that if you vote for
[1:07:14] the party that loses you kind of hide
[1:07:16] that fact you
[1:07:18] know what is it but there's something to
[1:07:21] be proud
[1:07:23] about we got something to be proud about
[1:07:25] it's much much greater identification
[1:07:28] sir are you with me now much greater
[1:07:31] identification than republican or
[1:07:33] democrat or American right or Word of
[1:07:36] Life Tabernacle or or citizen of Hardy
[1:07:40] Arkansas wherever that you live there's
[1:07:42] a much greater brother Justin a much
[1:07:44] greater identification than that what is
[1:07:47] that greater identification it's the
[1:07:49] pillar of fire appearing visibly Among
[1:07:52] Us amen he said I'd rather be identified
[1:07:54] with that identified in the word where
[1:07:57] that Shina of glory and Revelation lays
[1:08:00] the pillar of fire appearing visibly
[1:08:01] Among Us identifying that the message is
[1:08:04] right like he did at Mount
[1:08:06] Si oh my John 1 1 John 1 and one says
[1:08:11] that which was from the beginning which
[1:08:12] we have heard which we have seen with
[1:08:14] our eyes which we have looked upon it's
[1:08:15] a powerful scripture because John saw
[1:08:18] Jesus In the Flesh and he's saying what
[1:08:20] I saw what I handled the word of life he
[1:08:24] said for the life was manifested we have
[1:08:26] seen it so it wasn't a dead letter
[1:08:30] because it was
[1:08:31] manifested right so the quickening of
[1:08:33] the word is the manifestation of the
[1:08:35] word that's all it is healing in your
[1:08:38] body is just a manifestation of the word
[1:08:42] right it's a manifestation of the word
[1:08:43] God said by his stripes I'm Healed so if
[1:08:46] I have faith in that word healing is a
[1:08:48] manifestation of that right they shall
[1:08:51] lay hands on the sick and they shall
[1:08:53] recover what is it a manifest estation
[1:08:55] of the
[1:08:57] word amen so the word the life was
[1:09:00] manifested we have seen it and bear
[1:09:03] witness and show unto you that eternal
[1:09:04] life which was with the father and was
[1:09:07] manifested unto us that which we have
[1:09:10] seen and heard declare we unto you that
[1:09:15] you also may have fellowship with us and
[1:09:17] truly our fellowship is with the father
[1:09:20] with his son Jesus Christ listen to me
[1:09:21] Church you and I can say this morning
[1:09:23] we've seen him we've seen him in our
[1:09:26] generation not because we saw William
[1:09:28] brandom or or not because we you saw me
[1:09:30] or I saw you but because we saw the word
[1:09:32] coming open again being manifested again
[1:09:35] just like he was back
[1:09:39] then
[1:09:41] hallelujah brother Bram says I'm going
[1:09:44] to deal with this tonight but I'll just
[1:09:45] Dro this in here he said the evidence of
[1:09:47] receiving the Holy Ghost today is just
[1:09:49] the same as it was back in the day of
[1:09:50] our lord it's receiving the word of
[1:09:53] Truth for the day in which you live
[1:09:55] I I want to I want to give you
[1:09:57] some I want I want to give you some meat
[1:10:00] to that tonight so just just hold that
[1:10:02] in your heart now brother Brandon said
[1:10:06] Jesus never did stress the importance of
[1:10:08] the works as he did the word he knew
[1:10:10] that if the people got the word The
[1:10:12] Works would follow that is Bible now
[1:10:15] Jesus knew that there was going to be a
[1:10:17] terrible drift away from the word he
[1:10:21] said in the pergan age which was a as
[1:10:23] yet 200 years off from the patmas vision
[1:10:25] he knew that drift would cause them to
[1:10:27] go into the Dark Ages he knew that the
[1:10:30] way man originally got away from God was
[1:10:32] by first leaving the word if you leave
[1:10:35] that word you have left
[1:10:39] God I've had people tell me well brother
[1:10:42] Ben I still feel like a Christian but
[1:10:45] and you may still be a Christian God May
[1:10:47] bless you but that's not how we tell if
[1:10:50] we're right or
[1:10:51] not right how he tell is by the word
[1:10:56] and not by some
[1:10:59] Twisted you know we've done mental
[1:11:01] gymnastics to get there put this with
[1:11:04] this and we're the only one in the world
[1:11:06] that believes it right that's not the
[1:11:08] word I'm talking about talking about the
[1:11:10] plain word right it's not Mark Twain
[1:11:13] said it's not the Bible it's not the
[1:11:14] parts of the Bible I don't understand
[1:11:16] that have a that bother me he said it's
[1:11:17] the parts I do
[1:11:20] understand so it's not some kind of
[1:11:22] esoteric uh uh mind of something you
[1:11:25] figured out and it's okay for me because
[1:11:28] I've connected this with this with this
[1:11:30] same thing Satan did to Eve at the
[1:11:32] beginning it's not okay if the word says
[1:11:35] it's wrong it's wrong if the word says
[1:11:36] it's right it's right a and so brother
[1:11:40] Bram says he's presenting himself to the
[1:11:42] church at pergamus and indeed to all
[1:11:45] churches of all ages I am the word if
[1:11:48] you want deity in your midst how many
[1:11:51] know we need God with us we need God
[1:11:54] with us because you recognize your
[1:11:55] pastor can't do it by himself and and
[1:11:57] the song leaders can't do it by
[1:11:59] themselves and and the preachers can't
[1:12:01] do it by themselves and and you as a
[1:12:03] congregation you can't get in the spirit
[1:12:05] all by yourself and just you might be
[1:12:07] able to have a good time but you
[1:12:08] couldn't really affect any change you
[1:12:10] couldn't move you can't add to your
[1:12:13] stature one cubit you you can't add one
[1:12:15] hair back to your head but we serve a
[1:12:17] God who made your body we serve a God
[1:12:19] who can heal your body we serve a God
[1:12:21] who can change your mind we serve a God
[1:12:23] who can heal your mind we serve a God
[1:12:25] who can change our young people who can
[1:12:27] make them right we serve the word of God
[1:12:30] Amen and so he must be in our midst if
[1:12:33] he is in our M if you want be it in your
[1:12:35] midst welcome and receive the
[1:12:40] word don't ever let
[1:12:42] anyone or anything get between you and
[1:12:47] that word
[1:12:51] amen things affect us because we want
[1:12:55] something to be a certain way and
[1:12:58] because we want it that way Satan always
[1:13:00] attacks our
[1:13:01] feelings right he can whoop you on your
[1:13:04] feelings brother brand said because he
[1:13:06] attacks our feelings we want it to be a
[1:13:08] certain way and so we devise a path
[1:13:11] through the word that would reach us
[1:13:13] that would make it
[1:13:14] okay I say God I I know I'm a human
[1:13:18] being I know I'm subject to mistakes but
[1:13:19] let me acknowledge the word is
[1:13:21] true let me just say God you're right
[1:13:25] and I'm
[1:13:26] wrong could we say that today all of
[1:13:30] us brother Brandon says that which I'm
[1:13:32] giving you the word is a revelation of
[1:13:34] myself I am the word remember that he
[1:13:38] said I wonder if we are sufficiently
[1:13:42] impressed with the word in our
[1:13:46] midst amen remember when Jesus said this
[1:13:49] day this scripture is fulfilled
[1:13:51] immediately the next scripture they
[1:13:52] saidis this not Joseph's son
[1:13:56] right they weren't impressed because it
[1:13:57] just looked like a man and he stood up
[1:14:00] and said this day this scripture is
[1:14:02] fulfilled and it just appeared like it's
[1:14:04] just it's just the
[1:14:05] word oh
[1:14:07] church he said I wonder if we're
[1:14:09] sufficiently impressed with the word of
[1:14:10] the let me give you a thought here how
[1:14:12] do we pray we pray in Jesus name don't
[1:14:15] we every prayer is in his name or there
[1:14:17] isn't any answer yet in 1 John 5:14
[1:14:20] we're told this is the confidence we
[1:14:21] have in him that if we ask anything
[1:14:23] according to his will he heareth us and
[1:14:26] if we know that he hear us whatsoever we
[1:14:28] ask we know we have the petitions we
[1:14:30] desired of him right he said now we ask
[1:14:33] what is the will of God he said there's
[1:14:35] only one way to know his will and that
[1:14:37] is by the word of
[1:14:38] God one way to know his will by the word
[1:14:42] of God Lamentations 3:37 who is he that
[1:14:45] saith and it cometh to pass when the
[1:14:47] Lord commandeth it not there it is if it
[1:14:49] isn't in the word you can't have
[1:14:53] it he said so we can't can't ask unless
[1:14:55] it's in the word and we can't petition
[1:14:57] or ask unless it's in his name there it
[1:15:00] is again Jesus the name is the word will
[1:15:04] so to ask according to the word of God
[1:15:06] to ask in his name is to act ask
[1:15:08] according to his will which is to ask
[1:15:10] according to the word he said now then
[1:15:14] and I'll just tell you if you're a sick
[1:15:15] person today you can ask according to
[1:15:16] the word I don't care how old you are or
[1:15:18] how sick you are or what the doctor said
[1:15:20] about come on church you can ask
[1:15:22] according to the word he said I am the
[1:15:23] god that heals all
[1:15:28] if you're a person that wants to be
[1:15:29] saved and you need you need the holy
[1:15:31] ghost in your life you need a you need a
[1:15:33] change in your life you can ask and
[1:15:36] believe that God will give it to you
[1:15:37] repent and be baptized in the name of
[1:15:39] Jesus Christ for the remission of sins
[1:15:40] and you shall receive the gift of the
[1:15:42] Holy Ghost believe the word his name is
[1:15:45] the word his will is the word and if you
[1:15:47] do that and follow God's commandment he
[1:15:49] will fill you with the baptism of the
[1:15:50] Holy
[1:15:52] Ghost now he said brother Brown said you
[1:15:57] can't separate God in the word they're
[1:15:58] one he said' now then this word he was
[1:16:00] left behind on the printed page is a
[1:16:02] part of him when you accept it by faith
[1:16:05] into a Spirit-filled life so the spirit
[1:16:09] that's in you I want to challenge you on
[1:16:12] this today because I I hear people say
[1:16:14] well you know as the bride we're just
[1:16:17] waiting on the Dynamics to come and
[1:16:19] there is a there is a great Dynamics
[1:16:22] coming we're going to have a body change
[1:16:26] right but the Dynamics is the spirit of
[1:16:29] God in you so if you have the Holy Ghost
[1:16:32] you have the
[1:16:34] Dynamics right the Dynamics is not a
[1:16:36] good church service the Dynamics is not
[1:16:39] is not us all getting excited but the
[1:16:42] Dynamics is the spirit of God in every
[1:16:44] individual are you with me this way
[1:16:46] that's what the Dynamics is so we're not
[1:16:49] it's not that we're constantly because
[1:16:51] if we're not careful church we'll we'll
[1:16:52] be shaken by how the church is going
[1:16:54] going and and the church is going good
[1:16:56] but what if it goes bad you know what if
[1:16:59] some things happen we'll be shaken by
[1:17:01] how politics is going right some of
[1:17:04] y'all think politics is going good right
[1:17:06] now but huh come on
[1:17:09] church but what happens if it goes
[1:17:12] bad right what what are you going to be
[1:17:14] led by what are you going to what's the
[1:17:16] Dynamics to you what what do you what do
[1:17:18] you care deeply about what are you
[1:17:20] impressed by is it is it a win of a
[1:17:22] certain party is it a certain person
[1:17:25] singing is it a certain person preaching
[1:17:27] or is it the word being in our midst
[1:17:29] today the same yesterday today and Fe oh
[1:17:32] I say let's be impressed by the
[1:17:35] word let's grab a hold of the word make
[1:17:38] it our
[1:17:40] life and then you become steadfast and
[1:17:44] immovable cuz you're not relying on what
[1:17:46] people think about you you're relying on
[1:17:48] the word you're not relying on what
[1:17:50] people say about you relying on the word
[1:17:53] it's not about whether I see results I'm
[1:17:56] relying on the word listen if Noah went
[1:17:58] by results he'd have a hard time
[1:18:01] convincing anybody to come to his
[1:18:04] church he preached every Sunday and
[1:18:07] nobody believed
[1:18:08] it and he preached the same thing over
[1:18:10] and over again I try not to do that
[1:18:13] but just over and over and over again
[1:18:16] it's going to rain it's going to rain
[1:18:17] it's going to rain and every day every
[1:18:19] week the same congregation came and left
[1:18:21] came and left came and left finally the
[1:18:23] church went down just knowing his kids
[1:18:26] and they were
[1:18:31] suspect if you read the Bible there they
[1:18:33] were they were interesting
[1:18:36] people ham was in there and the women
[1:18:39] the women brother BR said serpant he'd
[1:18:40] come across through the women
[1:18:43] I look at that look at that church it
[1:18:46] looks like well that's not God not doing
[1:18:47] much but God was fulfilling his word
[1:18:49] that's right amen they had a rainbow
[1:18:53] Covenant they had God said God said
[1:18:56] you're going to make it through the
[1:18:57] flood listen to me church that's not
[1:18:58] even our type what's our type Enoch
[1:19:00] Enoch walked with God and he was
[1:19:02] not what was it he he he because before
[1:19:06] he before he was translated he had this
[1:19:07] testimony he pleased God oh Church how
[1:19:10] do you please God by believing his word
[1:19:13] that's the only thing without faith it
[1:19:15] is impossible to please him the Bible
[1:19:19] says are you with me now so we just
[1:19:22] can't look at results we can't look at
[1:19:24] you know I appreciate our church I think
[1:19:26] the results are good and we've got
[1:19:27] things growing good that's not what you
[1:19:29] look
[1:19:30] at look at the word that's being preach
[1:19:33] cuz results can fool you right cuz the
[1:19:36] Baptists have results the methodists
[1:19:37] have results I'm going do a lot of good
[1:19:39] things that's not what we count whether
[1:19:41] something's right we count it by the
[1:19:45] word amen I look brother brand said he
[1:19:49] said his word is life this word he was
[1:19:50] left behind on the printed page is a
[1:19:51] part of him when you accept it by faith
[1:19:53] in a spirit filled life he said his word
[1:19:54] was life John 663 but that is exactly
[1:19:57] what he is John 14:6 I am the way the
[1:19:59] truth and the life Romans 88:9 If any
[1:20:02] man have not the spirit of Christ he's
[1:20:03] none of his he said there it is he is
[1:20:06] spirit and he is life that is exactly
[1:20:09] what the word is that is exactly what
[1:20:12] Jesus is he is the word so in a spirit
[1:20:15] born Spirit-filled man how many have
[1:20:18] been filled with the spirit of God you
[1:20:20] know that the spirit born Spirit-filled
[1:20:22] man Hallelujah takes that word into his
[1:20:25] heart and places it upon his lips why
[1:20:27] that is the same as deity speaking
[1:20:30] Church you don't understand that I don't
[1:20:32] even I can't even comprehend that
[1:20:34] because we don't understand how powerful
[1:20:35] deity is but when we repeat the word
[1:20:38] when we speak the word we are not
[1:20:39] victims anymore we are
[1:20:43] creators you say well I'm in a bad
[1:20:45] situation the Earth was without form and
[1:20:49] void in a complete state of
[1:20:53] chaos oh Church chur and when the word
[1:20:56] of God the spirit of God the anointing
[1:20:58] of God the Holy Spirit moved on the face
[1:21:00] of the waters what happened in that home
[1:21:03] sir come on Church what happened in that
[1:21:04] home of mankind what happened in that
[1:21:06] place where God was calling where he was
[1:21:09] calling his children to be what happened
[1:21:11] in that place that was marked out for
[1:21:12] Redemption the the life begin to form
[1:21:14] Sun begin to come and the moon begin to
[1:21:16] come and and the botney life began to
[1:21:18] come and he brooded over until it came
[1:21:21] forth Why by the power of the word yeah
[1:21:25] but see many times we want to just speak
[1:21:26] the word and just
[1:21:28] boom
[1:21:30] mountains moved or made if you like
[1:21:35] mountains but that's not that's not how
[1:21:38] it works many times his word will not
[1:21:42] return to him void will accomplish what
[1:21:45] he said it would accomplish but it's not
[1:21:48] going to happen in my time or your time
[1:21:50] right but just speak the word amen
[1:21:55] look what he says the same as deity
[1:21:56] speaking Every Mountain has to go he
[1:21:59] didn't say how fast it would go but it
[1:22:02] has to go Satan cannot stand
[1:22:07] before that
[1:22:10] man if the
[1:22:12] church way back there in that third age
[1:22:14] had only held on to the revelation of
[1:22:16] the Living Word in their midst the power
[1:22:18] of God would not have faded as it did in
[1:22:21] those dark ages and right today when the
[1:22:24] church Church returns to the word in
[1:22:27] faith we can say without doubt that the
[1:22:29] glory of God and the wonderful acts of
[1:22:32] God will be in her midst
[1:22:34] again
[1:22:36] Hallelujah why because the word is alive
[1:22:39] what did Brother brand say when you read
[1:22:40] that this day the scripture is fulfilled
[1:22:42] he said I want to tell you how Dynamic
[1:22:44] the word
[1:22:45] is dynamic means alive
[1:22:48] quickened we should never look at the
[1:22:50] word of the hour as a dead letter I just
[1:22:52] want to address that for a moment we
[1:22:54] should at the message is dead
[1:22:56] letter if the message is dead letter to
[1:22:58] you you need the baptism of the Holy
[1:23:02] Ghost right because if it's the word if
[1:23:05] the Bible is dead letter to you you need
[1:23:07] the baptism of the Holy Ghost because
[1:23:09] he's the writer the author of the
[1:23:11] word right so that's how you change that
[1:23:15] situation I don't look at it as dead
[1:23:17] letter it's only dead if you've not been
[1:23:18] quickened that's right but if you've
[1:23:21] been quickened the word in you responds
[1:23:22] to the word on printed page
[1:23:25] now the word is the Dynamics because the
[1:23:28] word and the spirit is the same brother
[1:23:30] renom taught taught us that the church
[1:23:33] system was waiting on Dynamics we know
[1:23:36] that that the mechanics are there but
[1:23:38] they're waiting on Dynamics he said
[1:23:40] they're waiting on their Dynamics which
[1:23:42] is an influx of satanic
[1:23:45] power particularly in the form of the
[1:23:49] Antichrist so they're waiting on the
[1:23:51] Antichrist to become flesh that'll bring
[1:23:54] bring the Dynamics to the church system
[1:23:57] brother brand said there you are that's
[1:23:58] the hour that we've arrived at so the
[1:24:01] Dynamics will be to the machine that's
[1:24:04] there right will be a
[1:24:07] person I want you to keep that in your
[1:24:08] mind the Dynamics will be a person the
[1:24:11] Antichrist
[1:24:13] incarnate right he said there you are
[1:24:14] that's the hour we've arrived at and
[1:24:16] that's the big machine that's set up he
[1:24:18] said he said now they've got the
[1:24:20] mechanics the only thing they have to
[1:24:22] have is Satan in there with the Dynamics
[1:24:25] to force the marking of the
[1:24:28] beast when she is forced down he said
[1:24:31] then the Dynamics is working the
[1:24:34] mechanics is there and they've already
[1:24:37] got them so the mechanics have been
[1:24:39] waiting for all of these years for their
[1:24:41] person to
[1:24:43] arrive but let me say
[1:24:46] this we we believe that there will be a
[1:24:48] Dynamics coming to the church at what
[1:24:50] the person of Jesus Christ but but he's
[1:24:52] not coming back to the Earth
[1:24:54] in the way that the Antichrist is right
[1:24:58] he he he's coming back in the air we go
[1:25:00] to meet him right everybody knows that
[1:25:04] we go to meet him and then three and a
[1:25:06] half years later he comes down on the
[1:25:07] Mount of Olives with us right so so he's
[1:25:11] not he he's he don't come say so how do
[1:25:14] the Dynamics get
[1:25:17] here the son of man
[1:25:21] Ministry oh God the word made flesh
[1:25:26] how do the Dynamics get here a Rapture
[1:25:29] message see the B brother BR taught us
[1:25:32] that that the Rapture I know I know this
[1:25:33] is deep but just think with me for a
[1:25:35] minute and I don't it's not great
[1:25:38] because it's deep it you might just
[1:25:39] confuse people but I want you to
[1:25:41] understand right we want to make it not
[1:25:43] deep for you but but brother brand
[1:25:47] taught that the the shout was a message
[1:25:50] how many know that the shout was the
[1:25:52] message go back to the Rapture tape if
[1:25:55] the he said he does all three as he
[1:26:00] descends so where is the
[1:26:03] Dynamics where is the power to live are
[1:26:05] we waiting on something are we waiting
[1:26:07] on somebody are we waiting on another
[1:26:09] church are we waiting on more Fellowship
[1:26:11] are we waiting on this that or the other
[1:26:12] to come I say no we're
[1:26:14] not because the the
[1:26:16] Dynamics oh my came down with a
[1:26:21] shout and it'll culminate this age will
[1:26:23] culminate in the going home of the Bride
[1:26:26] where we'll see him in a flesh body in a
[1:26:28] glorified body you understand but the
[1:26:31] Dynamics is here hallelujah so the
[1:26:35] Dynamics is working brother Brandon says
[1:26:37] that the the bride he said will not be
[1:26:39] will not be brought together by natural
[1:26:41] force he said natural force drove Israel
[1:26:43] into their Homeland natural force drove
[1:26:46] the drives the churches into the into
[1:26:49] the Council of churches into the
[1:26:50] Catholic Church into a one world
[1:26:51] religion but it'll be it'll be the love
[1:26:54] of God hallelujah the power of God that
[1:26:57] that'll draw the bride into
[1:27:03] Christ yes sir brother BR let me say
[1:27:05] something this uniting time to see
[1:27:07] churches uniting Nations uniting it's
[1:27:09] United time uniting time with of God and
[1:27:12] his bride too he said I say this with
[1:27:14] reverence and respect I believe that the
[1:27:16] bride of Christ is called I believe
[1:27:18] she's sealed in the kingdom of God I
[1:27:20] believe the mechanics is there and
[1:27:22] they're waiting for the Dynamics that'll
[1:27:23] take her off the Earth in the glory and
[1:27:24] the Rapture I believe with all my heart
[1:27:26] yes sir we don't know how he's going to
[1:27:27] do it but he shall do it so there's a
[1:27:29] Dynamics coming are are you with me now
[1:27:31] but he's descending on us right now what
[1:27:34] we already have will be increased until
[1:27:36] we go
[1:27:38] home we're not waiting on a Pentecostal
[1:27:41] Revival we're not waiting on 1906 to
[1:27:43] repeat itself I'm not waiting on a bunch
[1:27:45] of gifts to pop up around the church
[1:27:46] what am I waiting on a person
[1:27:49] sir yes
[1:27:51] sir Hallelujah
[1:27:54] waiting for the Dynamics that'll take
[1:27:55] her off the earth into glory and the
[1:27:57] Rapture he said I believe with all my
[1:27:58] heart yes sir we don't know how he's
[1:27:59] going to do it but he shall do it what
[1:28:01] do we not know now now look there's a
[1:28:02] part we don't know what is that we have
[1:28:04] the opening of the word the seven
[1:28:05] Thunders revealed but we don't know the
[1:28:07] day or the hour but that's all we don't
[1:28:10] know brother Bram said he's here and
[1:28:14] he's the same in every aspect except for
[1:28:16] the Corporal
[1:28:17] body can we believe that church then he
[1:28:21] is the Dynamics in the mechanics
[1:28:24] right
[1:28:25] now you say well I don't believe that
[1:28:27] brother Ben okay here's what brother
[1:28:29] brownon said about he is the
[1:28:32] Dynamics we just become members of the
[1:28:35] machine Hallelujah of his body forming
[1:28:38] oursel into his image and see him
[1:28:41] uniting himself with us in his works
[1:28:43] with his love gifts as he hands them to
[1:28:46] us just before the wedding supper oh my
[1:28:49] his love gifts
[1:28:51] so I don't have time to get into that he
[1:28:54] we've been giving love gifts what is he
[1:28:55] talking about he's talking about the
[1:28:57] gifts that Rebecca got from
[1:29:00] elaser amen his love gifts El eer gave
[1:29:04] her the gifts but they were from Isaac
[1:29:06] they were from Abraham she was going to
[1:29:08] be married to Isaac I look his love
[1:29:11] gifts as he hands them to us just before
[1:29:12] the wedding supper and we're waiting
[1:29:14] watching for that they're big churches
[1:29:16] to be United speaking of the the church
[1:29:19] nominal he said the Dynamics of this
[1:29:21] church will be a refilling of the Holy
[1:29:23] Spirit that we have worked in small
[1:29:25] measure listen he's already here but he
[1:29:27] said we've worked in a small measure
[1:29:28] while The Headstone is coming down to
[1:29:30] unite with the body but when that head
[1:29:32] and body unites together the full power
[1:29:35] of the Holy Ghost would raise her up
[1:29:36] just exactly like that even the dead
[1:29:38] that's dead in Christ for hundreds of
[1:29:40] years ago will rise in the beauty of his
[1:29:43] Holiness and take a flight to the skies
[1:29:45] he said the Dynamics is the Holy Spirit
[1:29:47] the Dynamics is him he's here this
[1:29:50] morning church I want you to believe
[1:29:51] that with all of your heart he's here
[1:29:53] one day it'll become so great he he'll
[1:29:55] his presence will be so real it be so
[1:29:57] great not just a feeling but a reality
[1:30:00] of it that he's actually the dead will
[1:30:02] raise
[1:30:05] [Music]
[1:30:07] up right and we have you know Luther had
[1:30:10] just enough
[1:30:12] Dynamics to make the word live just
[1:30:14] enough for
[1:30:17] justification and Wesley had just enough
[1:30:20] for
[1:30:21] sanctification and a witness of the
[1:30:23] spirit
[1:30:24] shouting right Pentecost had just enough
[1:30:27] for the
[1:30:29] gifts run around the building but said
[1:30:32] they blew all their steam out the
[1:30:34] whistle right but I like to see that
[1:30:36] because it's evidence of steam you
[1:30:39] know right least they had
[1:30:44] steam people ain't got no
[1:30:46] steam but they just they blew it out the
[1:30:48] whistle but now look there's got to be
[1:30:51] the locomotive he said you got to go
[1:30:52] down the tracks how do you do that the
[1:30:54] Dynamics and the mechanics they had just
[1:30:56] enough Dynamics to do that but what do
[1:30:57] we have in this age a full seven course
[1:31:00] meal a full open book a full reality of
[1:31:03] the word being know don't you see why
[1:31:05] Satan would like you to look for
[1:31:06] something else some Revelation that
[1:31:07] comes by some man or some kind of an
[1:31:09] idea or some kind of a church or some
[1:31:11] kind of church don't be deceived by that
[1:31:14] look at what we already have what do we
[1:31:16] have the message of the hour which is
[1:31:18] enough to get us
[1:31:19] home
[1:31:21] amen yes sir
[1:31:24] brother BR said the Holy Ghost will
[1:31:25] always point to the word if it points to
[1:31:28] a Creed or denomination it's not the
[1:31:30] Holy Ghost he couldn't do that point
[1:31:32] away from his word when he died to
[1:31:33] confirm that word make that word a
[1:31:35] positive he died so he could come
[1:31:38] himself into that word he is the
[1:31:43] quickening life that makes that word
[1:31:45] live again that was his purpose of dying
[1:31:48] see through denominational ages he he
[1:31:50] was he was shut out and we find him in
[1:31:52] the lab see an age knocking get back in
[1:31:55] but when he is in the house he is the
[1:31:58] Dynamics of the
[1:31:59] mechanics listen and we are not those
[1:32:02] who not locked him out well listen we're
[1:32:05] not church he said I W call you church
[1:32:06] anymore I'm going to call you bride you
[1:32:08] realize what that distinction means it
[1:32:09] means he's entered in the door it means
[1:32:11] he's eating with you he's right here
[1:32:13] with you what does that mean it means
[1:32:14] that you're his bride and if you're his
[1:32:17] bride the Dynamics is here today listen
[1:32:19] to me young people you can worship God
[1:32:21] today you don't have to wait on a camp
[1:32:22] meeting you don't have to wait on
[1:32:24] something else to happen you can worship
[1:32:25] him today you can live above sin today
[1:32:28] you can live for God today you can you
[1:32:30] can work for God today every one of you
[1:32:32] don't matter what you've been through or
[1:32:33] what's happened in your life you can
[1:32:35] serve God with all of your heart why the
[1:32:37] Dynamics is here he's
[1:32:48] here I'm not pausing for effect I got to
[1:32:50] catch my breath
[1:32:56] remember said that was his purpose of
[1:32:58] dying and he could still project himself
[1:33:00] through his church and make every word
[1:33:02] someone say every word through every Age
[1:33:06] act just like exactly the way it's
[1:33:08] supposed to act he is the Dynamics of
[1:33:13] the
[1:33:14] mechanics the mechanics of the church
[1:33:16] what is it Apostles prophets teacher so
[1:33:18] forth he is the Dynamics that works that
[1:33:22] and it's worked by a certain dynamic
[1:33:23] which is called like he said he's the
[1:33:25] fire that fires off the gas he's the
[1:33:27] fire that's in the combustion
[1:33:30] chamber when the gas the word is poured
[1:33:33] over that combustion chamber he's the
[1:33:34] one that sets her a fire he's the one
[1:33:36] that confirms that he's the power of the
[1:33:39] Resurrection he is God he is the fire
[1:33:41] how many believe that today that's what
[1:33:43] he is without controversy great is the
[1:33:45] mystery of godliness for God was
[1:33:47] manifest In the Flesh seen of angels
[1:33:49] received up into the glory he was God
[1:33:50] come to take the sinner's place yes sir
[1:33:52] and when he God raised him up on the
[1:33:54] third day was for our
[1:33:55] justification therefore exalted at the
[1:33:57] right hand of the Majesty on high he is
[1:34:00] an intercessor to make intercession for
[1:34:02] our weaknesses oh I'm so glad for that
[1:34:04] today as we confess it to him and die
[1:34:06] out to oursel placing his word back in
[1:34:09] us the promise and our faith makes that
[1:34:12] word live because Christ is in us to
[1:34:15] quickener to the word see you've got to
[1:34:17] believe amen you've got to believe and
[1:34:22] and maybe we'll get to a little bit
[1:34:23] tonight but we you know you repent with
[1:34:25] tears why because it means something to
[1:34:28] you you're sorry for your sins but your
[1:34:31] tears is not what get you
[1:34:32] in God don't recognize your tears
[1:34:35] because if he recognize your tears he'll
[1:34:37] recognize Judas he' recognize Esau but
[1:34:40] he doesn't just recognize your tears he
[1:34:41] recognizes your faith so with those
[1:34:44] tears you got to have another about you
[1:34:45] says I'm going to live right I'm going
[1:34:47] to do right I'm gon to believe God I'm
[1:34:49] gonna be a Christian I'm going to serve
[1:34:51] the Lord how many can say Amen to that
[1:34:53] today I'm going to do what God says so
[1:34:56] it's not just constantly repenting going
[1:34:58] over and over being saved again and
[1:34:59] being saved again and again and again
[1:35:01] but once you've repented once you've
[1:35:02] really repented you believe you're going
[1:35:04] to make
[1:35:06] it
[1:35:12] good brother brandom says says we
[1:35:16] confess it to him our faith makes that
[1:35:17] word live because Christ is in us the
[1:35:20] quickener to the word how I wish the
[1:35:21] church would see that oh all arguments
[1:35:24] and strife would be over that would be
[1:35:27] the Supreme
[1:35:28] Court oh church that's the North Star
[1:35:32] Hallelujah that's the end of all Strife
[1:35:35] that's the end of all questions that's
[1:35:37] the end of everything God said so that's
[1:35:38] the absolute tie yourself to it he is
[1:35:42] our absolute because we have the
[1:35:43] Assurance of the Resurrection because he
[1:35:45] has raised in us how do we know he lives
[1:35:47] he does exactly what he did here when he
[1:35:49] was on Earth he's the same Pillar of
[1:35:51] Fire he said we got the picture of there
[1:35:54] he's the same one in the church how much
[1:35:56] more proof do we need Church he's the
[1:35:59] same one in the church he's here today
[1:36:02] yeah he's here this morning amen
[1:36:06] amen he's here
[1:36:08] today think about if you knew you had
[1:36:10] him sitting beside you Jared what would
[1:36:13] that mean think about
[1:36:16] it think about it Melody if you knew the
[1:36:19] word
[1:36:21] Christ Jesus let's say come in a cor
[1:36:23] body and he sat
[1:36:26] down sat down over here and the girls
[1:36:29] would look at him more than they look at
[1:36:30] the
[1:36:33] boys you think he wouldn't have all the
[1:36:37] attention come on Church you think he
[1:36:40] wouldn't make an
[1:36:44] impression Jasper if you knew the word
[1:36:46] was sitting beside you and he was there
[1:36:47] and you saw him and those
[1:36:50] hands were scarred for me
[1:36:54] those stripes were for
[1:36:57] me would you not make an
[1:37:01] impression come on church what do you
[1:37:03] not make an impression is there
[1:37:05] not I wonder sometimes but by eyes of
[1:37:09] faith we see him and we see that the
[1:37:11] promise of the word was he's
[1:37:13] here you may not have seen him in a
[1:37:15] flesh body sitting beside you but he's
[1:37:17] here this morning young people he's here
[1:37:19] today that's why we don't run around the
[1:37:21] church and act crazy and and and and
[1:37:23] disrupt things why because we believe
[1:37:25] he's here the word is here right Among
[1:37:29] Us his word is so powerful the message
[1:37:31] of this hour is so powerful that that
[1:37:34] that it just can change things in a
[1:37:36] moment so we do everything we can to
[1:37:37] honor that word and reverence that word
[1:37:40] and preach that word and sing the
[1:37:44] word we don't do it for personality we
[1:37:47] don't do it because it makes us feel
[1:37:49] good or makes us or or gives us a status
[1:37:52] we do it because we're honor ing the
[1:37:54] word he's right here that same logos
[1:37:56] that Pillar of Fire that moved he said
[1:37:59] he's in the
[1:38:01] church you you'd react a certain way if
[1:38:03] you had Sol Corporal body what if the
[1:38:05] pillar of fire was visible this
[1:38:09] morning brother Bruce what if he come
[1:38:11] down in your seat and sat right there
[1:38:12] and just hovered there over you and I
[1:38:15] could sit there like brother brand did
[1:38:16] many times looking at other dimension
[1:38:17] and say he's hanging right beside
[1:38:21] you go back on deep call to the deep
[1:38:24] sister Prince I thought of this today
[1:38:25] and here this woman begins to scream out
[1:38:29] and he said that that light following a
[1:38:31] colored woman back in the
[1:38:33] corner he says it right there on the
[1:38:34] tape and he tells them where it is and
[1:38:36] they believed it and in places brother
[1:38:39] BR says you can't see it but you can
[1:38:40] feel it he said the presence of God that
[1:38:43] you feel the presence you feel right
[1:38:44] there here this morning brother Joe that
[1:38:46] presence is that same presence of God is
[1:38:49] just dwelling around you that same thing
[1:38:51] that you feel that is the pillar of Fire
[1:38:55] fire oh church we got to believe that if
[1:38:59] he's here today what would our
[1:39:00] impression of him be if he's here today
[1:39:02] in this body he performs acts exactly
[1:39:04] like he did then what would we do if we
[1:39:06] had a need what would we do we'd go to
[1:39:08] him we'd tell him Lord I need you amen
[1:39:11] we wouldn't we wouldn't shy away from
[1:39:13] where he was we wouldn't we wouldn't we
[1:39:16] wouldn't not humble ourselves we believe
[1:39:18] in who he is oh if we could only believe
[1:39:20] in the word in that manner we believe in
[1:39:23] who is he's the same yesterday today and
[1:39:25] forever when I come where the message of
[1:39:27] the hour is being preached and the
[1:39:29] people of God are gathered together I
[1:39:31] can receive as if he was here in the
[1:39:34] flesh
[1:39:36] Hallelujah he's the same Pillar of Fire
[1:39:38] we got the picture of here there he's
[1:39:41] the same one in the church he's here
[1:39:44] today and in this
[1:39:46] body Hallelujah he performs and acts
[1:39:50] exactly like he did then
[1:39:54] brother brand talked about a a
[1:39:56] designer of cars you remember the story
[1:39:59] there was a mechanic that he got a g
[1:40:01] General Motors I've told you the story
[1:40:03] before that was the first problem he was
[1:40:05] at
[1:40:06] GM if it was a Ford maybe they not had
[1:40:08] to call the the big wig but anyway he's
[1:40:12] a it's all right to
[1:40:16] laugh the I think the word is okay with
[1:40:19] that brother Brandon said he played like
[1:40:21] a child at the door of the Father the
[1:40:25] Bible says Jesus rejoiced in
[1:40:29] spirit it's
[1:40:31] okay brother B tells this story about
[1:40:34] the mechanic he couldn't figure out what
[1:40:35] was wrong with this GMC vehicle you know
[1:40:37] and he just trying and trying he say
[1:40:39] he's fixing this and fixing that putting
[1:40:40] this part taking this part off putting
[1:40:41] that part on he said a man come in in a
[1:40:44] suit and he walked in the building and
[1:40:47] and he looked at it and he said can I
[1:40:49] take a look at it he looked at me he
[1:40:51] said well what do you know you're in a
[1:40:52] suits you know you don't know nothing
[1:40:53] about mechanics he said yeah I do let me
[1:40:56] take a look at it he said he walked over
[1:40:57] there and he just touched one little
[1:41:00] thing and started
[1:41:02] running he said what in the world he
[1:41:04] said who are you he said I'm the
[1:41:07] [Music]
[1:41:09] designer I'm the one that made that
[1:41:11] vehicle I'm intimately acquainted with
[1:41:14] what could go
[1:41:15] wrong oh Church don't you realize God
[1:41:18] wasn't surprised when Adam fell he
[1:41:20] wasn't surprised when he fell he was
[1:41:22] intimately with how they were
[1:41:24] made he he knew you would make mistakes
[1:41:27] he knew he knew how you would fall and
[1:41:29] everything would go wrong but he also
[1:41:31] knew his plan for Redemption for your
[1:41:33] life he knew he said I'll not leave you
[1:41:35] or forsake you he said I I I'll I'll
[1:41:37] change you I'll make you
[1:41:39] new he's a designer brother brand said
[1:41:42] in this hour brother we wonder what's
[1:41:44] the matter with our Revival what's the
[1:41:45] matter we got the material and
[1:41:46] everything we got the mechanics where is
[1:41:48] the Dynamics and that's what we need to
[1:41:51] move Jesus Christ in on the scene what's
[1:41:53] the matter he said I tell you there's
[1:41:54] one here today Hallelujah called the
[1:41:57] Holy Ghost to can touch the Dynamics he
[1:41:59] is the Dynamics of the mechanics he told
[1:42:01] the story about the little girl was in
[1:42:03] the cave when there's a man here the
[1:42:05] kernal light that's the name of the
[1:42:06] sermon he tells that story and he said
[1:42:09] that they were in that Cavern and when
[1:42:11] they turned out the light it was total
[1:42:13] darkness it's hard now because you know
[1:42:15] what happens when you're in a cave we
[1:42:17] women won recently and they turned out
[1:42:18] the light and everybody turned their
[1:42:19] cell phones
[1:42:21] on but before cell phones it was
[1:42:25] complete and total darkness that's
[1:42:28] right and so and so there was a a little
[1:42:32] a little boy and his sister there and
[1:42:34] little sister began to scream and the
[1:42:36] little boy says don't worry little
[1:42:38] sister there's a man here who can turn
[1:42:42] on the
[1:42:43] light oh Church what was the prophet of
[1:42:46] God doing in our age he didn't have to
[1:42:48] turn on the light he was only telling us
[1:42:50] there's a man here who can turn on the
[1:42:52] light who's he speaking of the word
[1:42:54] hallelujah the word he was like John
[1:42:56] standing in the river Behold the Lamb of
[1:42:59] God who takes away the sins of the world
[1:43:00] there's a man here who can change
[1:43:02] Darkness into light there's a man here
[1:43:04] this morning who can change your life
[1:43:06] into what it ought to be sir Amen
[1:43:09] brother brand said we stand today as
[1:43:10] Pentecostals the greatest Church in the
[1:43:11] nation thousands times thousands added
[1:43:13] each year but where is the Holy Ghost he
[1:43:16] said we accept it he said by speaking in
[1:43:20] tongues we seen how it's acted Methodist
[1:43:21] accept it by shouting Luther accepted by
[1:43:24] faith and so forth that isn't it he said
[1:43:26] it's the word it's the word turned on
[1:43:30] the light turned on the mechanics and
[1:43:32] they become
[1:43:33] Dynamics Church you realize what's
[1:43:35] happened in our day he the word came
[1:43:38] down and flipped the switch yes
[1:43:42] sir and the only thing holding back the
[1:43:45] Rapture is the
[1:43:47] time that's
[1:43:49] it everything else is here
[1:43:54] listen he said they become Dynamics they
[1:43:56] are dynamics I love this it's the word
[1:43:59] he said he turns on the mechanics and
[1:44:01] they become Dynamics they are dynamics
[1:44:04] when the Dynamics when the dynamic comes
[1:44:06] to the mechanic it starts the thing
[1:44:08] rolling I try take the word he said if
[1:44:11] there's one little thing missed up on it
[1:44:13] it won't start lay aside every weight
[1:44:15] every Isom every Creed amen that's the
[1:44:18] Dynamics of the Holy Spirit he said
[1:44:20] might flow through the word and
[1:44:21] vindicate the word that's promised to
[1:44:22] this day then the great Church of God
[1:44:24] will rise to her feet like a jet
[1:44:26] propelled plane take off to the skies to
[1:44:28] meet her master are we sufficiently
[1:44:31] impressed with one who can turn on the
[1:44:33] light come on Church what you say well I
[1:44:36] just think the word is just a dead
[1:44:37] letter you know we just need to move of
[1:44:39] the spirit we don't need the me
[1:44:41] preaching of the message anymore I beg
[1:44:42] to differ this word is alive and it's
[1:44:44] powerful it's it's here in its
[1:44:47] fullness Jesus was not a dead letter
[1:44:49] neither is this
[1:44:51] message huh you want you want Revival
[1:44:54] come back to the word you need healing
[1:44:56] believe the word you want to see a
[1:44:57] Rapture become one with the word do you
[1:44:59] long for manifestation keep the word
[1:45:02] pure brother BR said in every age we
[1:45:04] have exactly the same pattern that's why
[1:45:06] the light comes through some god-given
[1:45:07] messenger in a certain area and then
[1:45:09] from that messenger there spreads the
[1:45:10] light through the ministry of others who
[1:45:13] have been Faithfully taught oh God I
[1:45:16] pray that I've been Faithfully taught I
[1:45:19] pray that I've been Faithfully taught
[1:45:21] again we we've got to say with the word
[1:45:23] we can't deviate one way from it and
[1:45:26] I've had people tell me why don't you
[1:45:27] just play tapes in church and if you
[1:45:28] want to do that that's fine but for me I
[1:45:31] I I I believe the word tells me to
[1:45:32] preach that's right so if the word tells
[1:45:35] me to preach I'm going to do it as long
[1:45:36] as I have breath in my
[1:45:39] body people can do whatever how church
[1:45:41] however they want to but I I want to
[1:45:43] preach because that's what a prophet
[1:45:45] told me to
[1:45:47] do he told me to say what he said that's
[1:45:50] all I can do
[1:45:53] he said but of course all those who go
[1:45:54] out don't always learn how necessary it
[1:45:56] is to speak only what the messenger has
[1:45:57] spoken 1 Corinthians 14:37 they add here
[1:46:01] take away there and soon the message is
[1:46:02] no longer pure and the Revival dies down
[1:46:04] that's that reference of the scripture
[1:46:06] that he quotes after that he said they
[1:46:07] add here take away there and soon the
[1:46:08] message is no longer pure the Revival
[1:46:10] dies down how careful we must be to hear
[1:46:12] one voice for the spirit has but one
[1:46:15] voice which is the voice of God Paul
[1:46:18] warned them to say what he said even as
[1:46:19] Peter did likewise why we don't set up
[1:46:21] Bishops we don't set up anything else
[1:46:23] I'm responsible for the word brother
[1:46:25] Andrew Glover says I got my own books
[1:46:27] and I got my own
[1:46:29] tapes right and I can come preach to you
[1:46:32] without fear of what somebody else might
[1:46:34] say about it I'm glad of that church why
[1:46:37] because I have to stay with the
[1:46:41] word
[1:46:43] hallelujah Spirit only has one voice if
[1:46:45] he says something different from the
[1:46:46] word it's not the word no matter who it
[1:46:48] is Paul warned them to say what he said
[1:46:51] me as Peter did likewise he warned them
[1:46:52] even he Paul could not change one word
[1:46:53] of what he had given by Revelation oh
[1:46:56] how important it is to hear the voice of
[1:46:58] God by way of his Messengers and then
[1:47:00] say what he has been given them to say
[1:47:03] to the
[1:47:06] churches see that the letter kills let
[1:47:08] me just do with that for a moment I'm
[1:47:09] I'm going to keep you a few more minutes
[1:47:10] and then then we're going to go and eat
[1:47:12] okay just hang with
[1:47:14] me you said the the letter kth well you
[1:47:17] take that from 2 Corinthians
[1:47:19] 3:6 look what he said he's made us able
[1:47:21] Ministers of the New Testament not of
[1:47:23] the letter but of the spirit for the
[1:47:25] letter kth but the spirit giveth life it
[1:47:26] doesn't mean they rejected the
[1:47:28] Bible right they don't reject the Old
[1:47:30] Testament but what was the letter the
[1:47:32] letter was the
[1:47:34] law the law kills but Grace gives life
[1:47:39] the spirit gives life the letter is not
[1:47:42] the manifested word the letter is the
[1:47:45] law and it is true if you don't have the
[1:47:47] baptism of Holy Ghost if you don't have
[1:47:49] a spirit filled life then when you
[1:47:51] approach the message you can approach it
[1:47:53] it could be a dead letter that's right
[1:47:55] right because because you're not where
[1:47:57] you are supposed to be yourself but
[1:47:59] don't tell me it's a dead letter to a
[1:48:01] born again
[1:48:02] Christian right it's not it never can be
[1:48:05] why because the spirit in you anoints
[1:48:07] the word on the
[1:48:09] page Hallelujah Jesus was the life of
[1:48:12] the letter he was literally the word he
[1:48:14] said in the volume of the book it's
[1:48:16] written to me he's the word in their
[1:48:18] midst the Bible says that Jesus said it
[1:48:20] is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh
[1:48:22] profiteth nothing the words that I speak
[1:48:24] unto you they're not dead letter they're
[1:48:26] spirit and they are
[1:48:27] life he said many people just taking the
[1:48:30] letter the letter kill Spirit giveth
[1:48:31] life they take these Creeds and so forth
[1:48:33] still kth the Creeds kth but when you're
[1:48:37] taking the spirit that's God it's it
[1:48:39] himself how do you know it's God because
[1:48:41] he's taking the word and manifesting it
[1:48:44] he said then it's God himself oh my
[1:48:46] spoken word you see when he was born of
[1:48:48] a virgin in Isaiah 7:14 it was no longer
[1:48:51] a dead letter it was God man manifested
[1:48:54] Isaiah 7:14 circled the Earth for years
[1:48:56] and years and to many it was a dead
[1:48:57] letter but when it come to Mary it was
[1:48:59] not a dead letter it was a Living Word
[1:49:02] and when this message comes Church comes
[1:49:04] to the Bride of the hour it is not a
[1:49:06] dead letter it's a living Christ a
[1:49:08] Living Word are you sufficiently
[1:49:11] impressed with it I wonder as as the
[1:49:13] bride around the world are we
[1:49:14] sufficiently
[1:49:16] impressed with the
[1:49:18] word I trust that we are see he told
[1:49:22] John we got to a job to
[1:49:23] do he told John he said prophesy
[1:49:27] again remember Revelation
[1:49:29] 10:7 he talked about but in the days the
[1:49:32] voice of the
[1:49:33] Angel right when he should begin to
[1:49:36] sound the mystery of God would be
[1:49:38] finished but read verse eight The Voice
[1:49:41] which I heard from Heaven spake unto me
[1:49:43] again said go and take the little book
[1:49:47] which is open in the hand of the Angel
[1:49:48] which standeth upon the sea and upon the
[1:49:50] earth I went unto the angel and said un
[1:49:52] him give me the little book he said unto
[1:49:54] me take it and eat it up it'll make thy
[1:49:57] belly bitter it'll be in th mouth sweet
[1:49:58] as honey buty it'll be so good when
[1:49:59] you're receiving it it'll sound so good
[1:50:02] and then you go home and apply
[1:50:03] it start to digest it it gets a little
[1:50:06] bit bitter don't
[1:50:10] it verse 11 he said unto me thou must
[1:50:12] prophesy again why why why he had eaten
[1:50:16] the
[1:50:17] word
[1:50:19] listen he didn't come to John and say
[1:50:21] now John here I have the open book now
[1:50:25] go speak in tongues
[1:50:28] John huh is not what he
[1:50:30] said John go build a big church that's
[1:50:34] wonderful I pray one day we build a big
[1:50:36] church here you know as long as we got
[1:50:37] people to go in it we're not going to
[1:50:38] build a big church unless there's
[1:50:39] somebody to fill it right if all these
[1:50:42] kids grow up we might build a big church
[1:50:44] but he didn't tell John go build a big
[1:50:45] church he didn't tell him go build a
[1:50:48] hospital he didn't tell him go jump and
[1:50:51] dance what did he tell him take it John
[1:50:54] take the word now in that word there's
[1:50:56] dancing in that word there's shouting in
[1:50:58] that word there's music are you with me
[1:50:59] now it tells us to do that that's all
[1:51:01] the manifestation of that word but it's
[1:51:03] all a part of that word but eat the word
[1:51:06] eat the book he didn't say play fast
[1:51:08] music and dance John he said eat the
[1:51:10] book that's the focus of the hour that
[1:51:13] we're living in it's not the focus is
[1:51:15] not on the the
[1:51:17] product it's not on production value are
[1:51:21] you hearing me church I know these kids
[1:51:22] work very hard and very diligently to to
[1:51:26] put on or to uh to to produce a video
[1:51:30] that you could watch and when you're
[1:51:31] home not able to come they work
[1:51:33] diligently with that but that's not the
[1:51:34] focus of what we
[1:51:36] do the focus is not that the focus is
[1:51:39] not the the production of the music it's
[1:51:41] not the production of the sound what is
[1:51:43] it the focus is the word eat the book
[1:51:47] whatever else we do or don't do eat the
[1:51:49] book we have program we love our Sunday
[1:51:51] school teachers and our program
[1:51:53] I want to see a great Sunday School play
[1:51:55] they're going to do a Sunday School play
[1:51:56] I believe and it's just wonderful the
[1:51:57] things that we do the Fall Festival and
[1:51:59] all the things that we do and the
[1:52:00] fellowships but that's not what the
[1:52:02] focus is on the focus is the word we we
[1:52:05] can't have a fall festival every weekend
[1:52:07] but I can have somebody up here to
[1:52:09] preach to you the word every
[1:52:11] week are you with me
[1:52:15] now eat the word see when the focus of
[1:52:18] our ministry becomes the production of
[1:52:20] gifts or production of of a response
[1:52:24] we're no longer walking in the light of
[1:52:25] the
[1:52:26] hour the hour this the light of the hour
[1:52:29] is eat the
[1:52:30] book Hour the full word I know that's
[1:52:34] hard but I just
[1:52:36] church I want to see us grounded and
[1:52:39] settled sure about what we're shouting
[1:52:42] about brother BR said therefore no
[1:52:44] matter what a church would say what
[1:52:45] anyone else would say if you're born of
[1:52:46] the spirit of God you become part of the
[1:52:48] Bible God told Ezekiel he the prophet he
[1:52:51] said take the scroll and eat it
[1:52:52] and the prophet and the scroll become
[1:52:54] part of each
[1:52:55] other now listen you say but and there's
[1:52:58] many preachers I know preachers pastors
[1:53:00] who will tell you that's the prophet see
[1:53:02] it's the prophet and the scroll become
[1:53:03] part of each other they don't read the
[1:53:04] next paragraph what does the next
[1:53:06] paragraph say and that's the
[1:53:08] believer yes
[1:53:10] amen that's the believer how many
[1:53:13] believers do we have he said when he
[1:53:15] receives the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit
[1:53:18] wrote the Bible and the spirit of God is
[1:53:20] the word of God I wonder if we're
[1:53:23] sufficiently impressed with the word in
[1:53:25] our midst today oh Church he's here how
[1:53:30] many believe that he's here is there
[1:53:32] darkness in our in our life the dynamic
[1:53:35] of the word is here to bring light is
[1:53:38] there chaos in a home the word is here
[1:53:41] to bring life to that eat it up be
[1:53:44] clothed with it become one with it it'll
[1:53:46] change you like it did the Earth at the
[1:53:49] beginning is the musicians come I don't
[1:53:51] have this on the sides I just just want
[1:53:52] to read it brother the B said oh just
[1:53:54] keep following after him how many want
[1:53:56] to do that today just keep following
[1:53:59] after him as Elisha followed Elijah
[1:54:01] let's follow him for we must be taken up
[1:54:04] too someday we've seen The Chariot of
[1:54:07] fire that's a powerful
[1:54:10] thing you hear what he said we have seen
[1:54:15] the Chariot of
[1:54:17] fire what's he going back to you
[1:54:18] remember
[1:54:19] Elijah Elisha followed Elijah
[1:54:26] Church we've seen the
[1:54:29] fire The Chariot of fire that's going to
[1:54:33] take us
[1:54:35] home Elijah and Elisha standing there
[1:54:38] and here comes a chariot of fire and and
[1:54:40] what did what did Elijah tell Elisha if
[1:54:43] you see me when I'm
[1:54:46] gone are you with me if you see me when
[1:54:48] I'm gone he said if you see me while I
[1:54:52] while I leave he said then you can have
[1:54:53] a double portion brother BR said we have
[1:54:56] seen the Chariot of
[1:54:59] fire that lifted him out of the
[1:55:02] Grave we feel it among us
[1:55:06] now
[1:55:08] someday
[1:55:10] Hallelujah he's going to unhook the
[1:55:13] horses from the bushes well that's deep
[1:55:15] isn't
[1:55:17] it we're going
[1:55:19] up so he said the pillar of Fire
[1:55:22] The Chariot of fire is
[1:55:26] here and we saw it he had his picture of
[1:55:29] church it don't mean anything to the
[1:55:31] people but it means something to
[1:55:32] us right he had his picture taken with
[1:55:35] him but West and then what happened
[1:55:38] we've seen it and here's the Chariot of
[1:55:42] fire the pillar of fire but it's just
[1:55:45] hooked up to some
[1:55:48] bushes and one day some morning
[1:55:53] some golden
[1:55:54] Daybreak we play only believe if we
[1:55:56] could play that this morning some golden
[1:55:59] Daybreak what's he going to
[1:56:02] do he's going to
[1:56:05] unhook the power the logos the
[1:56:10] anointing the fire from the
[1:56:14] bushes we're just going to
[1:56:18] go you waiting on this to happen or that
[1:56:21] to happen everything else listen
[1:56:22] everything could fall in place in
[1:56:24] minutes seconds you don't know what's
[1:56:27] going on right
[1:56:29] now you said well there's got to be a
[1:56:31] woman president well how many times have
[1:56:33] people waited on Election to fulfill
[1:56:34] that and brother brand in one place said
[1:56:35] it's the Catholic
[1:56:37] church but if you go back and even say
[1:56:39] well there has to be a little woman I
[1:56:40] believe there will be but Biden is not
[1:56:43] exactly a young
[1:56:45] man could happen tomorrow could happen
[1:56:49] today so well the Antichrist got to come
[1:56:52] and become incarnate how do you know how
[1:56:55] close how far that is or how close that
[1:56:56] is are you with me now just like that
[1:57:01] that's but all I know is Sister Fritz
[1:57:05] the thing that's holding back that
[1:57:07] resurrection of that Rapture is the
[1:57:09] pillar of fire is just hooked to the
[1:57:13] bushes
[1:57:15] Hallelujah and one day brother
[1:57:18] Harvey we're going to see our loved ones
[1:57:20] again

[1:57:23] the power that we already have there'll
[1:57:26] be a great inflow of the Dynamics of the
[1:57:29] Holy Spirit say will that be a meeting

[1:57:33] your at at the funeral home of the Joe
