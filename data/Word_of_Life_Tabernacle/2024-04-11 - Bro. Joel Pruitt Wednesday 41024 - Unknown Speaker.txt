in your word to do Lord I pray that you would send a special anointing on the service tonight Lord and move me out of the way move each one of us out of the way so we can receive from you tonight and Lord I pray that anything that would be said and done would be For Your Glory and Honor I pray Lord that we could just worship with the freedom tonight and and receive from whatever you would have for us us Lord we just want to thank you that this is your house that we get to come and worship in but Lord most of all we we want to make sure Lord that we check up while we're here and become better Christians and better Believers and closer to you and we want to go out of here better Christians in what than the way we came and I pray you be with us now for every need represented in the building I pray Lord you would just touch each one those who couldn't come tonight I pray Lord you would go to where they are and move upon their behalf we ask all these things in Jesus name amen amen how many's happy to be in the house of the Lord tonight amen good to be with each one of you uh you can you can see the pastor is gone uh but you get his better looking brother so you're good and uh you can laugh he can't hear you it's okay so uh but but uh we miss him when he's gone he's been those have you enjoy the series he's been on recently that's been really a blessing to us and and my goodness the service this Sunday that was just a outstanding services and and uh I I don't think I can top that I feel a little bit intimidated after uh coming in behind those types of uh sermons and preachers that of that caliber but but uh I'll just try to get myself out of the way and let the Lord speak to you tonight amen if you have your Bibles let's turn to Joel chapter 2 and verse 25 it's my favorite book if you didn't know Joel chapter 2 verse 25 and it says I will restore to you the years that the Locust hath eaten the Anor worm and the caterpillar and the Palmer worm my great Army which I sent among you and you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that hath dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed can you say Amen to that Jude chapter 1 if we could go there quickly before you're seated Jude chapter 1:3 beloved I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the Saints and you may be seated if I could title this sermon tonight I would title it restored to the faith and I think that's what we're all looking for but I wanted you to notice there in verse 26 Joel 2 ver 26 he sh he said You shall eat in plenty and be satisfied so you know that there's going to be a famine for hearing the word of God in this hour we live in but if you'll read that verse there you'll know there's not going to be a famine for the word of God God but there's going to be a famine for the doers and hearing the word of God can you say Amen to that and so there is no shortage of the word of God in this hour if you want to hear the word of God you can hear the word of God Amen brother Brandon said it like this he said I came and he said I'm storing up food so that when I'm gone you'll have something to eat now that didn't mean that nobody can feed this to you but he said these ministers will pick up this message and carry it on until the coming of the Lord so that's what we're doing here tonight we're not trying to take his place we're not trying to to do something something that we're not called to do but what we want to do is take this message and just continue on with it until the coming of the lord we believe it's close at hand and and as brother Stuart would preach on on Sunday night about the signs we we've received the last sign to our generation and we know that the message has come and so we're not trying to bring a new message or a new idea but what we want to do is get this same message that's been preached and preach it to the people and let the word work on the people that need to hear it today I believe there's some people that need to hear the word word of God in this hour I believe there's there's some people here tonight that need to take this word of God and use it as its intended purpose and use it to kill some devils in your life there's a lot of you dealing with sickness there's a lot of you dealing with heartbreak but let me tell you this message can take care of that here tonight well come on somebody this message can take you can take this word and it will heal your disease you can take this word and it can restore your family back together you can take the word that's been preached and it can take care of any problem that you have in your life because it says you will eat in plenty and you'll be satisfied he said and then you'll praise the name of the Lord come on somebody you will praise the name of the Lord your God and that he hath dealt wondrously with you well he's there's been some bad days there's been some hard days there's been some hard times but in all the times that you've been through in the good times and the bad you can say he's been good anyway it doesn't matter what you've been through because though God slay me yet I'll trust God why because he's good no matter what the circumstances look like even in the worst of times God is good even when it looks like there's not an inch of daylight left and you think about the eclipse and there just a little bit of sun around the darkness but you could still see daylight what was it it's because there's still just a little bit of light left in this hour and I'm looking at a little bit of light in this hour when the world is completely in darkness and the world is in chaos there's a people who have received the message and the messenger for your hour and all we have to do is eat on that food and then we don't have to worry about what the world's going through and what our political system's going to do because that's not going to save you would you like to see a better president sure we want to see our country we want to see our country succeed and we want to see our businesses do better but that's not going to save you church that's not going to help you in your spiritual walk but what's going to help you is to feed on the word of God that has been given in this day because you can eat in plenty and be satisfied why because because it's a restoration message it's to take you back to what you have need of it's to take you away from the things that are trying to drag you down this is not to restore you to just a a tongue's interpretation this is not just to restore you to a gift of the spirit but it's to take you all the way back to where the Holy Ghost can move in your life again and you'll act just like they did on the day of Pentecost that's the restored back I want to be and I believe he has a bride on the earth that can be the exact same church that was here when the acts the book of Acts was written why because he said he would raise up another group of people and in this day and in this hour under her messenger you will be the final voice to the final age why because the word of God is Not Just on tape but it's in you you have ate the word of God you have taken of the word of God well I wish you'd preach with me here tonight you have taken and tasted of the things of God and all you have to do is put it into action and take this word of God and take it to your children give it to your children I'm not talking about forcing your children because you can't force them to be saved but if you give them an opportunity to hear the word of God in this hour it can change your life brother Joel how do you know it can do it cuz it did it for me how do you know it can do it cuz I took some kids over there to Youth Camp I see your sign buddy thank you they got an amen sign in the book in the booth back there and I I tell you what that's the loudest amen I've heard all night let me tell you something I took some kids over there and I saw god get a hold of some kids well was it wasn't no workup and some emotional experience but it was God in his word revealing that you can still have the Holy Ghost today and so you we want to go on back here and I I want to just go down quickly I'm running out of time already to be and to be restored and this is a a translation here that I pulled up it says to give back and to return and to put or bring back into existence or use it says to bring back or to put into a former or original state to put again in possession of something so this is not something that that that is not good anymore but it is to use again it is something that is a possession it is a possession of something you've got to possess the Holy Ghost in This Hour you've got to there's no there's not an option to get out of here if you want to get out of here alive you got to have the Holy Ghost and that's the only way you're going to do it and if you go by way of the Grave let me tell you it's a lot better to die with the Holy Ghost because you don't want to come to the Judgment church but let's go ahead and be judged right here by the word of God and let it let it change us and let it get us ready for a Rapture and you say well the Rapture may not happen well let let it get you ready for heaven anyway let it get you ready for what's coming why because this message will change your life brother bam says I will restore sayi the Lord I will restore all the days of the caterpillar I'll restore all the blessings that the Lutheran had and the Baptist had and the Methodist had I will restore sayith the Lord a tree that won't stand stiff but when the Holy Ghost Falls they're flexible we need some flexible trees again amen he said and you he said we might be green but we're flexible that's one thing about us we may not be doctors of divinity and we may not have all the theology but we're green enough to bend to the power of God and rejoice and have a real good oldfashioned Holy Ghost meeting that's what we need today brother more than anything else sweeping the worlden well they got quiet but let me say it again we need a good oldfashioned holy meeting more than anything else sweeping the world you can say well we need more teachers I I think there's a there's a place for teaching and and I I'm I thank the Lord for teachers I learned from them but I think in this hour what we need is the holy ghost moving upon people again because this hour is an age of all kinds of Darkness on us and if you don't have the light on the inside of you it will overtake you in this day and there'll be no way to overcome Darkness except by light right and so brother Rand said what we have he says he said he said brother that's what we need more than anything that's the way an old-fashioned Revival is when you reach down and get a better hold step off of that old cor cold formal deed over here and get over here on the vine of the Lord and go to eating the fruits and the grapes off the vine of the Lord he said I will restore sayith the Lord so he's telling you what you need but he also tells you what what what is here what he's got here is a storehouse full of everything that you would need for a spiritual diet everything you would need to be taught everything you would need to be preached everything that you would need to overcome leoa is in the word of God it is your spiritual diet for today now the reason that people don't eat this spiritual diet enough the reason you see people that are not listening to the tapes anymore the reason you see people that are not hearing the message on a regular basis regular basis or reading their Bibles like they should is is is because it has got an age of deception to where they think it's going to be okay if they don't do that it's it's going to be okay but did you ever try to quit eating for a while and see how you feel in a couple days that's right if you and and and the same thank you buddy and if you keep doing that think about it if you quit eating you start losing weight you're starving to death it's the same way when you quit coming to the house of God it's the same way when you quit picking up your Bible and reading it it's the same way when you quit hearing the message of the hour why you're starving yourself spiritually but church I think it's time to be restored back to where we want to hear the message again I think it's time we're restored back to where we want toar here and we want to read and we want to get into the things of God I think more than ever we need to be a church on fire that wants what God has for us well I'm going to preach whether you're here or not but I think tonight I think there's some people here I I know I know it's Wednesday night I know you're tired but I wonder if we could just take a few moments to step on the devil of leosia and say I'm not going to be a lukewarm and a cold church member what I'm going to be is a is a person is on fire for God I want to be so on fire that when people see me they want what's wrong with me because I look so crazy to them but I want to be able to everywhere Jesus said I would the men everywhere were were were praying and lifting up holy hands why because you'd be a little crazy to the world but now if you've got a coworker that don't even know you're a Christian or if you got somebody in your family that don't know what you believe I think you need to get on fire enough to create a Revival in your home and create a Revival for your children create a Revival for your church let a Revival start in me and let me be restored to the Joy that I have need of brother Bram said restore what all the beauty that she was at one time now he uses the word beauty there but he says the character of the church is the beauty or excuse me the beauty of the church is the character of the people it's not about how beautiful your church is it's the character of the people that's what makes the difference in a church that's why we want to have love one for the other that's why we want to have Holy G the Holy Ghost move in our services we're not trying to be different we're not trying to be better but we want to have a character a Christlike character where God would be pleased to come Among Us and dwell Among Us and move Among Us and work miracles Among Us well I'll tell you church I think it's time we wake up and go back to where we left him take a hold of what we have need of let God move in our families again let God come in Among Us let God cause us to act right and do right it's not a bunch of rules and regulations but let the Holy Ghost go to work again and when you say well well now I've got a little condemnation well let that condemnation change you let the word cause a change in your life and then when you change to match the word the condemnation will fall away David says here Psalms 51 and10 create in me a clean hold a clean heart oh God and renew a right Spirit Within Me cast me not away from thy presence and take not thy Holy Spirit from me that ought to be our prayer here tonight and in verse 12 restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and uphold me with thy free spirit oh I think everybody ought to pray that restore unto me the joy of my salvation it's not what it used to be but I want my joy back it's not what it used to be why there's been something to eat at it there's been an age of Deception come after you there's been some denominational Spirits get on you and it's eating away your joy it's eating away your peace and I tell you what it's causing it's causing an age of neurotics and it's causing anxiety like it never has it's causing depression on the people like it never has well you know I'm telling you the truth here tonight but let me tell you what God God will do to you he will give you a spirit that will overcome those things he will give you a spirit of Joy he will give you a spirit of peace he will give well come on somebody you're you're say well brother Joel why you preaching at me on a Wednesday night I'm not trying to preach at you but I think we need Joy back in the house of God again I think we need to have you know you say well you want to feel good yes I want to feel good when I go to church there ain't nothing wrong with feeling good in church there's nothing wrong with having fun in the house of God there's nothing wrong with enjoying your salvation if I can get excited in the ball game I can get excited in the house of God if I can get excited over the newest movie that come out then why couldn't I get excited in the house of God because he is eternal I'm an eternal being and if we're walking together then we've got to agree with each other because two can't walk together unless they agree but when I come under subjection to the word of God then I can walk in peace with God I can walk in peace with my brother I can walk in peace with my sister why because I have found the joy that I once knew and I have been restored back to it well come on Church you know what I think tonight I think we could all use a dose of a refilling of the Holy Ghost I think every one of us in the sound of my voice including myself could use a good oldfashioned dose of the Holy Ghost back in our church again where we can have a little bit more joy and a little bit more freedom and let some chains be broken I tell you what Jesus didn't go there and lock us up but he set you free from the demons that would try to overtake you we have got a savior in this hour that has come and he set you free and then we had a messenger come and say you are a free people you have a right to live like little children before your father you are free so why not act like it why not act like children amen well we're going to get through this one way or the other come on now I'm going to pull you are you going to pull me but we're going to get through it one way or the other now there was these these worms that ate at this tree every one of these worms ate at something joy and and they took and they would cause a form of godliness and did you know that Satan didn't mind there being churches come up in those age as long as he could get them to go back to the way he wanted them to worship Satan didn't care if you had a church he don't care if you're here tonight as long as you sit there and you don't care that you're really here but if you'll actually enter in one time you'll find that Satan will fight you well you don't well I don't want to be no you do want to be fought by the devil you want to fight that Spirit of sleepiness on a Wednesday night why because that Spirit has come after you and tried to overtake you and keep you from a blessing here tonight but can I go ahead and tell you something you have to fight back and you if you can overcome that Spirit then God can move on you on a Wednesday night he can move on you on a Sunday night it don't matter what time it is if God is here then all things are possible to them that believe I was just reading the report before I come out about brother Danny and now they said they didn't see any cancer that had spread or nothing and I said praise the Lord God still works God still works you you've looked at many of you know brother Ron Spencer the man's had stage four cancer for what seems like years and yet you can stand there and see the man stand there and he's I tell you God give me courage like that and yet if we're a little tired we don't want to go to church let me tell you I want to stand here here I don't care how I feel I don't care what's going on I want to kill that devil of leoda and we be restored back to a church that would wait all night if they had to on the power of God to come down that's the kind of church I want to be that's what I want to be we're not going back to to to ausa Street 1906 Pentecost but we're going all the way back restored all the way back this is a Biblical move we're a part of did you know you're in a Revival right now yes sir but what youve got to do is participate in it you're in the bride's Revival the bride's Revival has come with the opening of the word well come on Church the opening of the word came and that was the bride's Revival you could live again you have seen things that you could never see before let me tell you young people something you know when we say the opening of the word we're not just talking about uh we're not just talking about a a new book or or like a Book of Mormons would have a new book no this was not a new book it was actually the the book that was already written it was was the scroll that was already sealed up until the time of the end but the book has now been open so you can actually see what it says now you say is the book open to everybody no the book's not open to everybody this book is only open to those who have eyes to see and ears to hear well come on somebody it it's still as closed As It Ever Was if you cannot see the revealed truth of the hour why because if you turn it down you're still walking in darkness but this book would come open and the seals would actually come off of it when you accepted the message of the hour and now you can see things that you've never seen before well then why don't the Baptist see it like we do because the seal has never come off to them and the seal has never been broken to them but to us it was broken oh come on Church you say why was it broken to me it you must be bride is all I can tell you because he's got to call somebody out in this hour he's got to have somebody ready and you've got to have the word to get ready for a Rapture right amen so I saw it Illustrated one time and I won't illustrate it because I don't have a kid here that I want to use and I don't have a long enough neck tie but I I was listening to a minister one time and he was showing me I I didn't know what the opening of the word was I was younger and I didn't know never heard it preached on in my life and he took his necktie and wrapped it around that Bible he said now it's sealed up and then he took it off and he said now it's open well that's true except if you can't if you if if you're not willing to open it if you're not willing to read the contents of it and believe what it said then you'll never know that the book's actually open but if you'll actually read the book and you actually see what it said then you'll see a message that came and the opening of the word when it was started to reveal you'll start to see Christ unfolding himself as we heard Sunday morning you'll start to see Christ unfolding himself or maybe that was Wednesday night they all run together but but but but listen to me Christ is unfolding himself again he unfolded himself through a man called William Brandon we could see Christ in the aspects of his life you could see him reveal he was a son of man revealing the son of man but can you see him now revealing himself in a body called The Bride you are a restored body you are a word body you are you are a word bride you are everything that the Bible taught would come you are living it out now you are the generation you are the ones that was told to come well come on Church you are the you are the expression of the open book you are the revealing of the word of God you are this day the scripture is revealed why because you are living the word of God I've got to live the word of God and if you can be a written epistle and I could be a written epistle then what are we we are the word made flesh today sir well that's a little hard on me brother Joel you are the word made flesh but you got to walk in the light of the word you've got to you've literally got to do what the word say head why it's not just a rule well well brother Joel I don't know if I'm doing it well do what you do know and walk in the life that's been shown to you maybe it won't all be shown to you right away but as it's unfolded walk in the light now if you hold a flashlight down here at the floor and you look at that light you walk where that light is now you don't know what's coming up here you don't know what's over here and what's over here but you walk where the light has been shown why because you can see where you're going and it's the same way with the message when the message shines something on that Bible and it opens it up to you walk in that light of the word and every time it moves move with the light now that's what we need to do today now let me get on down here I actually haven't got anywhere yet but we're going to try to get you know sometimes our young people don't understand that that we use phrases all the time and maybe they don't understand what we're saying but I just want to say this the opening of the word was the message literally revealing what was on the pages of the Bible and it is coming to life today it is the word becoming alive again it is not a deadly letter because the letter kth but the spirit giveth life and the the the spirit has comeing this day to restore everything back everything that this one ate everything the Lutheran would take out everything the Baptist would take out everything the Wesley would take out it's restored it all back to an original church with an original seed well come on somebody and if you are one of them you can see what the word is doing in this hour and he said here he said I will restore say the Lord all the years I'll send back another church he said I will restore that original Power again in the evening time it shall be light can you say amen amen he said down in the heart of that tree no matter how many branches is pruned there will come forth the Royal Seed of Abraham I believe that's you here tonight and I I believe if I was you I'd say that's me why because you have got to be the Seed of Abraham now you may not look back in your family history and see Abraham in your family history you may not be able to say hey that was my great great great great great great 500 times Grandpa but what you can do is say it doesn't matter if he's there or not because my natural seed has no bearing on the spiritual seed and I can look back and say I see Christ in my in my family history I see Abraham I see Isaac I see Jacob why because you are the Royal Seed of Abraham through Christ and he said all down through there he said he said God promised it and God will do it he said he would do it I will restore all the years that the denomination heat I will restore all the years I the thing off but yet there will come a vine out of the heart of it and he'll be like a tree that's planted by the rivers of water a man that's planted by the rivers of water and that meditates in the word of God day and night not to a Creed not to a denomination come on somebody he said not to a denomination but meditates in the word day and night he'll be like a tree that's planted by the rivers of water branches shall not wither well I hope you hear me right there you can't dry up if you're planted by the rivers of water you can't be a dead church member if you're planted by the rivers of water you can't be formal if you're FL if you're sitting by and you're planted by the streams flowing with the spirit of God moving by you all the time why there'll be a breeze go by and you'll be green and be able to move with it why you're not going to be an old stiff tree that ever time the spirit moves you start to croak a little bit all right all right come on now well you can say am man if you want to but let me just tell you this we've got too many that have decided to make Church a formal Creed even in the message but I think it's time we recognize we're not just normal church members there ain't nothing normal about us we're a bunch of oddballs the very best of us the very best dressed the very quietest of you you're still just an oddball you're just an ugly duckling anyway you might as well worship and let the devil know whose side you're on he said he'll bring forth his fruit in the season now we believe in the season now and let me let me tell you what season it is Malachi 4 you all know the scripture Malachi 4:5 behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to their fathers un lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse so this is the age of turning back this is a time of being restored this is a time where we can see things that you've never seen before this is a time of understanding things you've never understood before that's right he he said him that understandeth will I grant now he he goes on and I've been listening to uh uh the the the restoration of the brid tree and I think if you go listen to that message it'll really help you it's a long one so if you got to sit down and study it and figure it out but but that is a wonderful sermon it'll tell you where we're at right now it is showing you who you are as the bride it is showing you what what age we're in it is showing you that there is a time where the people have to recognize their God and say we are the generation that's not going to stop we are the generation that's not going to turn back we are the generation who not going to say when the Giants start coming that we're going to give up and go back no we haven't even seen what Pharaoh had and we don't want to go back because what we're looking back to is a Pentecostal blessing and that's what we want that's what we need well come on somebody what we need is a Pentecostal blessing in the church again you can say well I don't want to be Pentecostal you are a Pentecostal if you're an acts 238 Christian that's right yeah some of you are saying well are you saying we you no you're a Pentecostal the devil will attack all kinds of names on a church I'm a Church of Christ I believe we should be but I like my music think about it the devil can use good names on a church that doesn't make the name wrong but the devil used it wrong but I mean you could say that uh you know you could say an assembly would be a bad word because some churches use it wrong I don't have any problem with assembly you can say the word church has been used wrong and it has it's become a soup supper brother Bram said and it's become a lodge and a place to play cards and and listen I have I believe in Fellowship I think a church ought to be so full of love for one another they can't wait to fellowship with one another but I think when when the main thing is no longer the preaching of the word then the church has lost its focus we have got to keep the word in front of the people we have got to keep well come on somebody we've got to keep the spirit of God Among the people we got to keep the word preached to the people you've got to know who you are and recognize your day and what you're living in so that you can see what you've got to go back to sometimes you get ahead of the you you get the cart ahead of the horse a little bit and say well I want my healing but did you ever go back to identify yourself with the Healer I need to identify myself with something and I am so proud to identify myself with the message of the hour it's not a cult it's not a lie I'm not worshiping a man but what I've come is to worship God in his fullness in this hour you say why did people laugh at me for believing like I do because they laughed at Jesus for believing like he was he was God in flesh and they laughed at him do you really think you're going to get it any easier they couldn't see God walking among them right they couldn't see a a prophet that lived a life in you you take brother brandom's life and and people couldn't put a finger on it and now you got some people sitting behind the the screen that are sitting there you know keyboard Warriors well what about this and what about that well God never revealed it to you intellectual faith God never revealed it to those that didn't have faith to believe in the first place he bypassed those types of people and gave it to you because he knew you had a seed to accept it yes it's going to be hard yes it's going to be uh it's going to be different because it's not what the world makes look common but what's come common to you is not the word of God if you're living in the things of the world listen we have to live among the people of the world we have to be around the people of the world that's that's part of your everyday life that's part of your job but you do not have to be partakers of the spirits that are in the world you can come to church and you can say Lord renew renew a right Spirit within me I I I got around the wrong crowd and I started doing things I shouldn't have said or shouldn't have said doing things I shouldn't have done I got around some bad people but I've come back here to lay down my life before you I'm not going to give in to the spirit of leosia but I'm here to be a worshipper in the house of God I'm here to say I'm on the Lord's Side and I would like to say tonight if you're on the Lord's Side I'd say come on over here where we can worship freely where we can say Amen in church where we can back the word of God unashamed because the Bible said I could rejoice and I could have peace and I would be unashamed in this day to declare the counsel of God to you why because I know without a shadow of a doubt I'm not looking through my carnal mind I'm not looking through eyes of what the internet has to say about the prophet but what I'm saying I've seen it in the word of God I saw where he's going to send Elijah the prophet I've seen in the word where there would be a man that would be here in this day that would do the same sign that Jesus did and he come and done it so I'm not worshiping him but he he didn't stop there he said that man would call out a bride that message that that man brought would call out a bride why Christ is the word and he brought the word of God with him and Christ come down and confirmed it and Christ didn't die in 1965 but he's still here tonight we don't have to we don't have to look back and say well well well what about brother Brandon what did he it look quit looking at the man look at the message look at the message he brought he was one of the greatest men I I I think I'd love to meet him I'd love to do that but that but that's not what I'm looking at I've never seen him but the Bible said blessed are you who have not seen and yet believe so I can say tonight even though I've never seen him I believe the message that he brought because it was a message of thus sayith the Lord it was a message of restoration and it has restored my heart back to the faith of the Pentecostal fathers I've not been restored to the Baptist I haven't been restored to the Methodist I haven't been restored to a modern-day Pentecost but I believe my heart is being restored all the way back to where I can worship without restrictions in the house of God I well come on somebody when he took you back to that age he's taking you back to a time where there's promises because in the land of the message of the hour there is a land of promise and if your children are gone that's the land of promise where you can get them back let me tell you something if you're dealing with something tonight if you're dealing with any sort of sickness you're in the land of promise in the message of the hour you do not have to fear cancer you do not have to fear heart disease you do not have to fear arthritis sister Patty stood right up here on on Sunday night I believe it was and and listen my brother stood there and said you'll be a testimony and she said the very next day the pain was gone from her hands you say God's not real God is still God and he's still doing Miracles today just as great as he ever was well I'll tell you I I I know Sister Jessica's not here but I want to tell you there there was a sister down in Louisiana brother jery and sister Rebecca would know who I'm talking about and all her hair came out but after praying for her and I I don't know how long it was but now she's got a full head of hair I was seeing the pictures there at Camp over at brother Timothy showed them there at camp and you can see somebody who had lost everything all all the hair on her head and then the next thing you know she's got a headful of beautiful hair what is it it is a god of restoration it is a God who can still heal it is a God who can still save you say well can he do it for me he can do it for you can he do it for my children he can do it for your children can he do it for my church he can do it for your church Church he's done it before he'll do it again let me get on down here where I can close you ever hear the story about the man brother Evans I don't have this in my note so I might misquote this you forgive me brother Evans car was stolen from him there in Louisville I believe it was and and uh they come to brother brandom and told him he had all this everything that he had was in it I believe his clothes and everything and brother Evans come to brother brandom and said my car has been stolen and and and I I don't know where it's at we can't find it and uh so brother Brandon said he was praying and he saw a vision and the car was going to Bowling Green and was coming back you've heard the story I I hope I don't miss I just heard it today and now I can't remember all of it but but but he was going to Bowling Green and he come back now I heard a brother the other night that was preaching and he actually used that story and what he said was he said everything in that car when it come back brother Braham saw the men bringing it back when they brought it back everything was still in place he they didn't steal nothing everything was in place but there was a half a tank of gas gone now this brother said well I always wondered why couldn't have God why couldn't God have kept the gas tank full when he brought it back well there has to be a scar sometimes to remember how far you went but to see the goodness of [Applause] God sometimes you got to have a scar but you came back the car may have went may have been stolen but it's coming back see what I'm telling you is this don't worry about the scars don't look look at the scars don't look at the situation but look to what God is more than able to do God can still move on the scene tonight for your situation he can still move there's been men and women all over this message that are testimonies that God is still in the healing business he's still in the saving business I can tell you he's still in the Holy Ghost filling business I've seen it done right well I wish I could take a show of hands but these young people I can tell you there was a couple of them sitting there in church and I am so proud to say that when they come back and told me I got the holy ghost I don't care what anybody tells me I'm just going to take them with their word and believe it why because I want to believe that God still works I want to believe that God still fills with the Holy Ghost I want to believe that God can still change a young person that is going astray and bring them back to the house of God and they can worship again and they can take complexes off of them and fear off of them well let me just go ahead and tell you for a minute God can still do what God's always done and if he ever gave the Holy Ghost to one he can still give the Holy Ghost today you say well how old you have to be you young people you don't have to wait for the Holy Ghost till you're in your 30s you don't have to wait till you're in your 20s but let the presence of God come down one time and touch your heart and change who you are it'll change your mind it'll change what you are well I might I've made a mistake since then brother Joel let me go ahead and tell you something you're going to make a whole lot more you're going to make a whole lot more mistakes Having the Holy Ghost doesn't keep you from Ever from ever sinning but what it does is it brings you back immediately listen you you'll do something wrong and something on the inside says you know what I should shouldn't have done that why because you've had a change in your nature it you don't want to do wrong no more you don't want to mess up no more you want to come back to the house of God you want to come over and over again and get a refilling after refilling why because one feeling is not enough that initial re well I'm already here might as well go ahead and say it the one feeling that you got at Camp is not going to be enough that's not it that's not that's not the end of it you said well I got the Holy Ghost yes thank the Lord for it but brother brand said there is refilling after refilling after refilling when you start to well this just come to me but I want to say it to you young people when you start to feel the REI Revival fires die down get back in the house of God and seek the Holy Ghost again amen you're not saying you never got it but I want a refilling of it I want to go back it's a message of restoration it's going to take you back to where you left him it's going to take you back to your first love it's going to well come on church it's going to restore unto you the joy of your salvation if you let it if you let it so I want our young people I want our old people I want us middle AG or whatever I am I want all of us to understand that when you come in here it's not just another service but we're serving a god of of Second Chances we're serving a god of restoration we're serving a God who can still still do what he did in Bible days he came and proved it on Earth again and he's proven it over and over again well my 's almost up but let me go with this brother said no how no matter how far you stooped in sin you're still Sons and Daughters of God because you're fallen degenerated in your soul and mind well come on somebody sister Stephanie sitting there saying amen why because she's know she knows what God can do she know God can take you out of a a life of sin and bring you back to the house of God and set you on fire again well I tell you sometimes I think it's the one sitting on the church pew that need to experience a refilling of the Holy Ghost I love to see people on fire for God Lord help me not to sit there like a knot on a tree and not be able to move why I want to be able to say Amen to the house of God I want to be able to say Lord I want more of you every service when the song leaders singing the songs I want to be able to raise my hands and say thank you Lord for saving my soul thank you Lord for making me whole well if you haven't experienced it yet I say it's time you experience it I think it's time you had an experience of of God in the house of God again brother man would go on here he said you're lost undone cre creation of God dominated by the devil that's right but still your sons and daughters of God he's not willing that any of you should perish but all might come to repentance see he's done everything that lays possible for only God himself could do this to give the opportunities to the creature of his to accept and be what he wants you to be back in your right estate again he wants to restore you back to your right mind he wants you to lose the mind of the world and take on the mind of Christ it is a restoration process that's right glory amen brother brand said no person in the right mental status is in their right mental status until they've accepted the Lord Jesus they call us crazy am but but they're crazy if they haven't accepted what we've got amen listen church I I'm not putting anybody out because there brother Brandon made a statement there'll be some there that we don't think will be there and some there that we we thought would be there that won't be there I I'm not the judge but I'm going to tell you this I think you'll see a I I I I I believe this with all my heart I believe the bride will be doing the works that Christ did on the earth I believe that'll be the bride that doesn't have anything to do with someone being saved or the whosoever wills but I will say this the bride of Christ will be doing the works of Christ on the earth until is coming why because that is our job to do we have taken on his spirit and if you have the spirit uh if you had the spirit of uh uh well you just pick a person if you had the spirit of an Auctioneer you'd be Auctioneer and if you had the spirit of a of a Bill Gaither you'd write songs nobody knows who that is anybody you don't your grandma has not raised you right she does she does you just ask her she'll tell you exactly who that is but if you have the spirit of Al Capone you don't know who that is either that's good if you had the spirit of Jesus there you go I finally found somebody he knew about well that is the best one but if you have his Spirit won't you do his Works come on somebody we might as well have church while we're here I got a minute left listen we don't have to worry when we come to church and say well I wonder if the preacher is going to preach at me well you know what if your if your heart's right with God I don't care if the preacher starts preaching you say well that must have been for somebody else but if if the word does move on your heart if the word is trying to correct your life in some way it's not me it's not brother Ben it's not brother Stewart it's not any other brother that can come in here preach to you the word itself is what has to come into your life and it will change you it will take you back here's an old song take me back to the way it used to be take me back Lord take me back why because I want to go back to where I found him and go back and feel that experience all over again it's like a person that's been married a long time and maybe they maybe they maybe theyve they're not on their honeymoon no more and things have changed why you want to go back why because you remember what it was like when you when you first found that girl and she looked at you and she was pretty and she was young and and all those things and she's changed it goes both ways doesn't it brother Bill think about it I want to go back I want to fall in love with Jesus all over again I want to love him like I never had before I want to feel this presence like I've never felt it before why because there's something within me that when I get cold I got to come back that's why the Holy Ghost is important here tonight church it's not just so we can have a loud church because the Holy Ghost isn't always loud sometimes you'll sit there and you'll cry like a baby sometimes you'll raise your hands and scream I'll take it however he comes but I want his presence I want to be restored to that again I want that Restoration in my life I want wonder if we could everone say that tonight I want to be restored back to my first love I want to be restored back to a book of Acts church I want to be restored back to where I lose this cold formal well you know I just don't want to be the way I am no more I want to keep pressing forward and pressing on because it's not them that that that starts the race but it's those that finish the race it's those that can keep on keeping on and keep on with the ways of God why because brother Brandon would say it like this he said what is it enforcing give it back see that's it that's what it's talking about restore it bring it back to its right owner and he said and Satan has if Satan has robbed you of the privilege of being a son or a daughter of God we have a right by the Holy Spirit to enforce the claim of God and bring it back amen well come on somebody you have a right you say well I don't have any rights yes you have a right you've been given the spirit of authority you've been given a spirit of power why it's not your power it's not your Authority but is Christ Christ that has given you the authority it is his spirit in you doing the Greater Works it is his Spirit that'll bring a bride out of the Le of sea and take her on up in a Rapture why he said if he's Afflicted you and made you sick we have a right before God to enforce the laws of God by his stripes we are healed how many needs healing here tonight if you're if you're sick put your hand up to him say Lord I I want healing I'm enforcing my right to Healing here tonight what is it he said he said Satan turn him loose bring him back and turn him loose and you're taking out yonder of death and we claim him and bring him back he said that's the enforcement restore it back to its natural condition again a man is sick a baby is sick a woman is sick see they're out of their natural condition they're you're not listen church it's not natural for you to be sick it's not natural for you to be lost but it's natural for you according to the laws of God to be healed it's it's natural for you to come to the house of God and worship it's natural for you see it's unnatural to keep you away from the things of God but God has given you the spirit to overcome the unnatural affections of the things of the world and has given you a natural affection again for the things of God and the love of God he said he was wounded for our transgression with his stripes we were healed and now we have a right to enforce that law and the lawgiver the Holy Spirit himself is here the agent of God to see that it's done that way well I'd like to say this just in closing as musicians would come brother bandam said my min hisory is to declare he is here we heard it a camp when brother Andrew was preaching he said he read that quote over and over again my Ministry is to declare he is here and I would like to say that maybe that was brother Brandon's Ministry but as a minister of the Gospel I'd like to say this I want to stand here Time After Time and declare that he is here he's not listen we know the Corporal body's coming but his spirit is here we don't have to wait for the spirit to come in a special service we don't have to wait for a spirit to come but the spirit of restoration is here I wonder how many tonight would say Lord restore me back restore my joy again restore my health these are benefits of God that belong to you these are your inheritances that belong to you nobody can take them away why because it was written in the palm of his hand that you are his son you are his daughter and nobody can tell you it was written with blood and it cannot be taken away God has given you the authority to walk all over devils and walk all over the spirit of condemnation and walk all over the spirit of depression why because the spirit of depression has no hold anymore the spirit of look come on somebody the spirit of sickness has no hold on you you know what sickness is it's a devil cast him out come on somebody are you sick here tonight cast that devil out do you need the Holy Ghost tonight cast that devil of unbelief out and accept that it's yours you say well what is this well do we just do we just name it and grab it and I'll tell you what it's almost that simple if you can just come before God in the right attitude you can have whatever you need sir amen stand to your feet tonight brother BR said this in closing he said when he separated Eve from Adam Eve fell by disbelieving the word that's right that's where the church failed today disbelieving the word but in this case to the Royal seed called predestinated to eternal life the Royal Seed of Abraham they believe that word I don't care what comes or goes how much they laugh who says this that or the other they are ordained to eternal life and she goes right straight back her and her lover Christ is one sir can you say Amen we are the generation sir we are the generation how many believer that here tonight amen you are a part of that generation I've heard it said like this you're a Joshua generation you had the fighters that come through the Wilderness always want to go back I wish we could go back to Egypt I wish we could do this oh but we don't want to do that we've already crossed Jordan let's just keep going promises are already here we're in the land now we are a restored people don't let the devil tell you you're not you are restored but you got to recognize the restoration message and it's time it's here it's here it's for you well don't let the devil beat you over the head and say you can't have healing you are already healed I can't have joy you have joy just go ahead and accept your joy tonight accept your freedom and we're going to sing this and if you have a need on your heart you can raise your hand where you are you can come and kneel at the altar you can come we'll pray for you but I want to say this tonight don't leave here with doubt in your mind don't leave in don't leave the church and say well it was just another service and we wish the pastor would have been here me too but listen it's not about me it's not about it's not about you what does he want from you tonight what does he want does he want me to surrender my life again I think he does I think he wants to give you Joy back in your home he wants to restore joy to your marriage joy to your joy to your house joy in the church Joy when you sing Joy when you shout it's a god of restoration and a message of restoration don't let the devil hold you back back tonight wonder if you could bow your heads for a moment I see Hands raised I know there's many in here tonight that say Lord I I need direction I need I I I just need restoration I need I need a refilling with the Holy Ghost I'd raise my hand with that and say every service I come Lord fill me up again fill me up again give me that experience when I when I first received and I couldn't hardly stand up and and I was I'd lost I'd lost all ability to care what what anybody thought about me take me back to that point Lord if I have to lose myself I can find myself I want to be that generation that's an overcomer in this day we are the generation oh we're the cination the final voice the world will hear the coming of the Lord is near living out the Revelation overcoming sins Temptation the truth will go to Every tongue and Nation We Are The Chosen

of Jesus Christ you're sinless you're spotless in his eyes well you don't know what I've done I don't care what you've done you are the Bride of the last days I think somebody needs to confess it here tonight I am she I am the bride I am the Overcomer I'm not going to back down to Satan and his tricks I'm going to accept the Holy Ghost I'm going to accept every refilling that comes I think there ought to be some Joy here tonight why because we are Overcomers and we're not looking at what we've done we're looking at the cross and we're looking at what he is and he's taking us all the way back
