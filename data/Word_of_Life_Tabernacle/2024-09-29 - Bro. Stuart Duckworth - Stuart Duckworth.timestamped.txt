[31:47] help them be there while they dedicated
[31:48] the church brother Ben beard so that was
[31:51] uh also a place I went to church as a
[31:53] child and so we really enjoyed got to
[31:55] see the new building and things and eny
[31:57] enjoy the fellowship and but we're
[31:59] looking forward to What the Lord Has for
[32:01] us today now we've got uh brother
[32:04] Stewart's going to preach this morning
[32:05] just in case I had a flat tire I
[32:07] scheduled him to preach this morning and
[32:09] then I'm going to preach this afternoon
[32:11] and we'll have lunch as usual in between
[32:13] brother Paul Seymour is going to be
[32:15] baptized this afternoon and uh I hadn't
[32:19] yeah go
[32:22] ahead Brother Paul's been here at the
[32:24] church for some time he's a real
[32:26] Christian I believe in a man of God but
[32:28] he just uh he wanted to be closer to the
[32:31] Lord and and and really felt at this
[32:34] time to be baptized in the name of the
[32:36] Lord Jesus Christ and so we're going to
[32:37] do that today and and uh just believe
[32:40] that uh that God will uh just bless him
[32:44] continue to bless him we've got uh his
[32:46] son Paul III with us as well this
[32:49] morning welcome thank you for being here
[32:51] and and uh if there anything we can do
[32:53] for you we sure love to do that we just
[32:56] love the people of God and we've learned
[32:58] to love brother Paul and sister Tracy
[33:00] and uh their giving spirit and their
[33:03] love for the church and their community
[33:05] and I believe he's a real Christian I'm
[33:07] going to go ahead brother Paul and and
[33:09] and read this now so I don't forget it
[33:11] when we come time to the baptism but uh
[33:14] brother Paul uh wrote a a little note
[33:17] about baptism and he said that baptism
[33:20] in our Lord Jesus's name he said not
[33:23] long ago an elderly elderly neighbor
[33:25] came to me and told me about getting B
[33:27] baptized in jesus' name in a local
[33:30] church he shared his uh his upbringing
[33:33] of that particular denomination that
[33:35] prompted him to do it he felt this
[33:37] qualified him to make it to heaven
[33:40] without any change in his daily life and
[33:43] uh Comm the Commandments from a church
[33:46] he said can give you a false sense of
[33:48] security so we don't want to ever we
[33:50] don't want to ever just uh just follow a
[33:52] Creed we want to do it because it's in
[33:54] our heart we want to serve God because
[33:56] it's in our heart don't you want to do
[33:58] that so that's what brother Paul is
[34:00] saying here he said we know it's a
[34:01] commandment of the word most important
[34:03] it's our desire to truly follow and live
[34:05] the word the message it's a sacred and
[34:08] important part of cleaning out our
[34:10] vessel to make room for the indwelling
[34:12] of the Holy Spirit that's what we all
[34:14] want this morning isn't it the word says
[34:17] I cannot dwell in an unclean vessel I
[34:19] believe that so we're washed in baptism
[34:22] as a type as a symbol of being Washed by
[34:25] the blood of Jesus and and it shows the
[34:28] world that we belong on on Christ's side
[34:31] and he said if you repent and be
[34:32] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[34:34] the remission of your sins you shall
[34:36] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost so
[34:38] we're just believing for a a filling of
[34:41] the Holy Ghost on brother Paul a
[34:42] refilling on all of us this morning how
[34:44] many could use a refilling of the Holy
[34:46] Ghost I think we could all use that this
[34:48] morning I believe it'd be helpful to us
[34:51] we we sure face a dangerous World a hard
[34:53] age and we need to know that we've got
[34:56] the Holy Ghost on our side and
[34:58] and we need to know that the word is
[34:59] with us amen amen God bless you let's
[35:02] stand together we'll invite brother
[35:03] Stewart to
[35:05] come don't you just love the Lord this
[35:08] morning man can we think the goodness of

[39:21] and6 just kind of the thought that we've
[39:24] had worship under Redemption for a while
[39:27] it's hard for me to get away from that
[39:28] there's so much there but just a title
[39:31] of faith in God remembering his promise
[39:33] to his children Hebrews 11:6 but without
[39:37] faith it is impossible to please him for
[39:41] he that cometh to God must believe that
[39:43] he is and that he is a rewarder of them
[39:46] that diligently seek Him amen you can be
[39:48] seated this morning
[40:00] man who's happy to be in the house of
[40:01] the Lord this morning and mean we just
[40:03] want to talk about faith just here for a
[40:06] little bit and just certainly just want
[40:09] to enjoy the presence of the Lord this
[40:11] morning amen so faith in God's word is
[40:16] what brings the results amen faith faith
[40:19] in God's promise is what brings him on
[40:22] the scene amen and so we look here uh
[40:26] something that brother R said here he
[40:28] said Faith knows no defeat faith is
[40:31] perfect Faith brings things when there
[40:33] is no things to be brought Faith creates
[40:37] Faith takes the doubt away it takes a
[40:40] negative and it makes a positive amen do
[40:42] you believe that this morning amen maybe
[40:45] you're in a negative part of your life
[40:47] amen but there is a positive coming amen
[40:50] and we don't have to live in that
[40:52] negative all the time but Faith tells us
[40:54] that there's something coming amen
[40:57] there's hope for the believer our faith
[40:59] can look past the negative and it can
[41:01] look to the positive and your faith can
[41:04] create that positive atmosphere amen you
[41:08] have that ability by the faith that you
[41:10] have in the word of God to create an
[41:12] atmosphere to where something can take
[41:14] place amen you have that power as a
[41:17] Believer this morning wisdom versus
[41:20] Faith he said what does faith do it just
[41:22] believes it the way it is amen the way
[41:25] that that God has has it preserved all
[41:28] the way down through the age he says
[41:30] here it is it's the word of God for me
[41:33] God Honors that and it gives a perfect
[41:36] faith in its truess amen Faith doesn't
[41:39] add or take away from the word amen
[41:41] Faith doesn't make excuses for the word
[41:44] amen it Faith just believes it the way
[41:46] it is it doesn't it doesn't try to
[41:48] reason in a way or try to figure it out
[41:50] amen Faith just says that's what it is
[41:52] and that's what it's going to be and it
[41:54] brings you from a negative to the
[41:56] positive
[41:58] right and anointed ones of the end time
[42:00] he says what is faith faith is something
[42:02] that's revealed to you come on faith is
[42:05] something that's revealed to you that is
[42:07] not yet but you believe it will be he
[42:09] said I've always loved this he said
[42:11] faith is a revelation of the will of God
[42:15] so if we can ever get a revelation of
[42:17] what God's will is what God's purpose is
[42:20] amen and live in that amen that's that's
[42:23] a revelation and nothing amen when you
[42:25] can get that revelation of the will of
[42:27] God and the purpose of God Amen nothing
[42:29] can move you off that and that's what
[42:32] faith
[42:34] is he says now Faith is a revelation
[42:37] from God faith is a revelation he says
[42:40] there I want to say he said it's a
[42:42] revelation he has revealed it to you by
[42:44] his grace it's nothing that you figured
[42:47] out he said it's nothing that you did
[42:49] it's not you didn't work yourself up
[42:51] into Faith Amen to ever have faith it's
[42:54] give to you by the grace of God Amen and
[42:57] God reveals it to you therefore is a
[42:59] revelation and the whole church is built
[43:02] upon Revelation amen is that what you're
[43:04] standing upon this morning it's not the
[43:07] revelation of a or the understanding of
[43:09] a man's idea or or your favorite
[43:11] preacher's idea but you yourself have a
[43:14] faith you yourself have a revelation of
[43:17] the promise of God for your life for the
[43:20] promise of God for this age amen and so
[43:25] and that will bring you from the
[43:26] negative of this this life because
[43:28] there's so much negative right Amen Let
[43:30] Let us look this morning amen by faith
[43:33] to the promise of God that will de
[43:35] Deliver
[43:36] Us
[43:38] amen
[43:40] amen he says here in perfect Faith he
[43:43] said perfect faith is a master of all
[43:46] circumstances amen perfect Faith Masters
[43:49] all circumstances there no matter what
[43:51] it is it Masters it he said when you
[43:54] believe anything do anything you've got
[43:55] to have faith and what you're doing no
[43:58] matter what the circumstance is amen
[44:00] that don't have one thing to do with it
[44:02] see it Masters that
[44:05] circumstance amen Faith believes that
[44:08] God will work it out do you believe that
[44:09] this morning amen amen amen let us
[44:13] believe amen let us not be in in
[44:16] disbelief and doubt amen amen no matter
[44:18] the situation no matter the circumstance

[44:23] amen amen and that's what my faith looks
[44:25] to in this hour yes

[44:32] him on the scene that's what brings God
[44:35] on the scene your faith and your love in
[44:37] his word amen that's the way of the
[44:39] believer and so in the time of trouble
[44:42] in the time of need whatever your need
[44:44] would be this morning whether it be a
[44:46] spiritual physical domestical Financial
[44:50] amen it takes faith in his
[44:53] promise and to receive of the blessing

[45:44] same in principle he's the same in power
[45:48] he's the same in love he's the same in
[45:51] every way that he was then amen if you
[45:53] could just take that promise this
[45:55] morning if you could just take it under
[45:57] yourself amen all things are possible to
[45:59] them that believe you would say oh I
[46:01] wish I I wish Jesus would come by my way

[46:46] midst of the church this morning and
[46:48] you've got to put the word on your lips

[46:52] lips that's the same as deity speaking
[46:55] amen that's the that's God coming forth
[46:57] from you amen and that's what brings him

[56:32] never buy that amen but being faithful
[56:34] will bring the blessing of God upon your
[56:38] life you believe that this
[56:42] morning brother BR says I'd rather feel
[56:46] in my heart the presence of Christ that
[56:48] I feel now than to have the riches of
[56:51] this world that's right I love him and
[56:53] he's wonderful can you say Amen to that
[56:55] this morning
[56:56] amen I'd rather have the joy of the Holy
[56:59] Ghost than the joy of the world Amen I'd
[57:02] rather have the joy of God and the
[57:03] happiness of God than than anything that
[57:06] this world can offer amen because it's
[57:08] Everlasting amen amen you could run out
[57:11] of money you could run out of this you
[57:13] could run out of that you could you
[57:14] could sell your possessions and get

[57:18] never run out of this amen for it is an
[57:20] everlasting Fountain amen amen it's a
[57:23] bubbling spring amen that can overflow
[57:25] in The Believer
[57:26] amen it's whatever you have need of this
[57:30] morning amen he is
[57:33] able a blessing of God
[57:36] Amen we look at Faith here what is what
[57:39] is Faith it's the foundation of who we
[57:42] are as Christians it's the foundation of
[57:45] the believer and so brother Brown says
[57:47] he says You must be born again when and
[57:50] when you're born again amen you cannot
[57:52] be born again without having faith faith
[57:55] is the foundation
[57:56] of it all for without faith it is
[57:58] impossible to please God Amen but you
[58:01] must believe that he is an a rewarder of
[58:03] those that diligently seek Him amen and
[58:05] when you're a skeptic of the Bible when
[58:07] you're a skeptic of the word being right
[58:08] you might as well just stay back until
[58:11] you can believe it and he said what is
[58:13] sin it's unbelief and there's only two
[58:16] elements that control the human being
[58:18] that's either doubt or faith one or the
[58:20] other you're possessed of that one and
[58:22] that dominates your life just depends on
[58:24] how much Faith you have how high you can
[58:27] rise how many Born Again people do we
[58:30] have here this morning amen if you're
[58:32] born again by the word of God you can't
[58:35] help but believe the word of God because
[58:37] that's that's what's your birth from
[58:38] you're not birth from an idea you're not
[58:40] birth from just just a uh a certain
[58:43] experience amen but your birth to
[58:45] believe the word amen and if you're
[58:47] birth to believe the word amen amen
[58:49] there's nothing amen that you can't
[58:51] receive from God in this hour amen
[58:53] there's nothing amen there's nothing
[58:55] that too negative amen that that
[58:57] positive that Faith won't bring you
[59:01] through amen let your faith rise this
[59:04] morning amen let your faith rise shake
[59:07] the doubt shake the demon of unbelief
[59:09] shake the demon of formal ideas and and
[59:12] and then and the devil that says you
[59:14] can't can't have this and try to talk
[59:16] you out of something amen Shake That
[59:18] spirit this morning amen shake the LIE
[59:20] the devil that he told you you can't
[59:22] make it that you can't get through that
[59:24] you can't have your healing amen shake
[59:26] the LIE of the devil this morning and
[59:28] believe the word amen don't be beat down
[59:31] as a son or daughter of
[59:33] God
[59:36] Amen come on Lord help us this morning I
[59:39] got a long way to go amen Romans 5
[59:43] therefore being justified by faith we
[59:46] have peace with God through our Lord
[59:48] Jesus Christ so that word Justified
[59:52] means you're free this morning amen that
[59:54] he has Justified you
[59:56] he has made you righteous
[59:59] amen by whom also we have access by
[1:00:03] faith into this grace wherein we stand

[1:00:18] justification amen he is the one that

[1:00:22] that freed you from your old life of
[1:00:24] Doubt amen he is our justifier this
[1:00:26] morning amen and he was raised for our
[1:00:29] justification and the holy spirit amen
[1:00:32] amen has brought you from death unto
[1:00:34] life amen to believe the word in this
[1:00:37] hour than Lord to sit in Heavenly places
[1:00:44] amen we look
[1:00:46] here we're living in the greatest time
[1:00:50] that the world has ever
[1:00:51] known it's a time of fulfilling of every
[1:00:54] promise it's the greatest time of Mercy
[1:00:58] yet it's the the world Waits it's a
[1:01:00] greatest it's greatest judgment amen
[1:01:03] judgment is upon this Earth you believe
[1:01:06] that amen we're living amen under the
[1:01:09] prejudgments of God God waiting to take
[1:01:12] his bride from this Earth and before his
[1:01:15] full judgment can come upon this Earth
[1:01:17] amen he has to take his bride away amen
[1:01:21] you're holding everything back this
[1:01:22] morning you're holding back the wrath of
[1:01:25] God and this our do you believe that do
[1:01:26] you understand that amen what you mean
[1:01:28] to the economy of God what you mean in
[1:01:30] this
[1:01:32] hour and so it's going to take it's
[1:01:35] going to take more faith brother B said
[1:01:37] in this hour than ever before amen for
[1:01:40] we have the promise of the Rapture the
[1:01:43] coming of the Lord and so the only way
[1:01:46] we will ever make it the only way we
[1:01:48] will ever make it is under the
[1:01:50] leadership of the Holy Ghost the only
[1:01:53] way that we can be the right kind of
[1:01:55] people the right kind of Christians the
[1:01:57] right kind of father and mother the
[1:01:59] right kind of young people is to be
[1:02:01] filled by the Holy Ghost and to be led
[1:02:04] by the Holy Ghost and I say if you're
[1:02:05] led by the Holy Ghost this morning it
[1:02:08] will inspire you to do the will of God
[1:02:11] that's what the Holy Ghost is therefore
[1:02:13] is to inspire you to do the word of
[1:02:17] God
[1:02:19] Amen yes
[1:02:21] sir Hebrews 11 and 23
[1:02:26] well brother Ben I sure wish you
[1:02:28] to been you this morning
[1:02:31] buddy do me like
[1:02:36] that Hebrews
[1:02:38] 11:23 you love the Lord this morning I'm
[1:02:42] preaching with all I've got
[1:02:44] amen get a little bit of water here I
[1:02:48] drunk about two bottles in the back I
[1:02:50] guess that wasn't
[1:02:53] enough amen Hebrews 11:23 by faith Moses
[1:02:57] when he was born was hid three months of
[1:02:59] his
[1:03:01] parents because when they saw he was a
[1:03:03] proper child and they were not afraid of
[1:03:05] the king's commandment I love that by
[1:03:08] faith Moses when he was come to years
[1:03:10] refused to be called the son of
[1:03:12] Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to
[1:03:15] suffer Affliction with the people of God
[1:03:17] than to enjoy the pleasures of sin first
[1:03:20] season esteeming the reproach of Christ
[1:03:23] greater riches than the treasure in
[1:03:25] Egypt for he had respect unto the
[1:03:27] recompense of the reward and so we look
[1:03:30] at these people here and and we talked
[1:03:32] about you know it's a hard time to raise
[1:03:34] a family and I think we can draw from
[1:03:36] the word and look at the at the faith
[1:03:39] and the belief of this family here come
[1:03:41] on and so these were these were people
[1:03:44] that weren't afraid of what the world
[1:03:46] said come on they weren't willing just
[1:03:49] to go along with the
[1:03:51] times but they were identified with
[1:03:55] God's promise
[1:03:56] of Deliverance and and no matter how
[1:03:59] long they were in Egypt it they didn't
[1:04:02] bend to the ideas or the system of that
[1:04:06] day amen may we be that kind of people
[1:04:08] amen God has called us in this hour to a
[1:04:11] life of faith and worship amen amen and
[1:04:14] not to be constantly burdened down with
[1:04:16] this life amen but to have freedom but
[1:04:19] have have freedom and liberty in the
[1:04:21] Holy Ghost not to be slaves of a system
[1:04:25] but to have fre Freedom as Sons and
[1:04:26] Daughters of God and Satan will do all
[1:04:29] he can Amen to destroy or hold that back
[1:04:33] that Liberty of the children of God his
[1:04:36] purpose is to to destroy your faith amen
[1:04:39] the design of his kingdom is to make you
[1:04:41] and I God's people too busy for the
[1:04:44] things of God that's the design of this
[1:04:47] Satan's Eden to make us burden down amen
[1:04:49] but there's a liberty this morning amen
[1:04:52] for the children of God amen amen we
[1:04:54] don't have to live under that burden
[1:04:56] there is a promise of Deliverance for
[1:04:58] you and I amen and that Deliverance has
[1:05:00] come in this hour I say by the word of
[1:05:03] God Amen it's freed us from man's
[1:05:05] tradition it's freed us from the ideas
[1:05:07] of denomination amen it's freed us from
[1:05:10] the things of the world Amen and it's
[1:05:12] called us out of this chaos amen we've
[1:05:14] heard a voice in this hour Amen to come
[1:05:16] up high oh there's a Deliverance for you
[1:05:20] and I in this hour amen yes sir amen but
[1:05:25] Satan will
[1:05:26] constantly amen try to bring us under
[1:05:29] that burden on and so I say let your
[1:05:31] faith amen rise above that this morning
[1:05:34] don't let Satan put you under the things
[1:05:36] amen that God has promised for us in
[1:05:39] this age amen we're we're living in
[1:05:41] Satan's Eden we're living in the design
[1:05:44] of Satan amen we're amen where we get
[1:05:47] too busy to
[1:05:48] pray we get too much on our mind to even
[1:05:52] relax in the presence of God and when
[1:05:54] you get to a spot like that amen it
[1:05:57] begins to break down your relationship
[1:05:59] with God even it begins to break down
[1:06:01] your relationship with brothers and
[1:06:03] sisters it breaks down our home life
[1:06:06] amen but I believe this morning we shall
[1:06:08] obtain by faith the promise of God Amen
[1:06:12] by faith we can break that curse we can
[1:06:15] break the curse that the enemy would try
[1:06:16] to put us under that burden in this hour
[1:06:19] do you believe that amen by faith we can
[1:06:22] break the cycle of Satan's kingdom and I
[1:06:24] say this morning Amen Let there be a
[1:06:26] faith this morning let there be a
[1:06:28] worship in your heart in the house of
[1:06:30] God Amen if Satan's built up walls
[1:06:32] around you this morning tear those walls
[1:06:34] down if he's built up things and
[1:06:36] complexes in your mind break those
[1:06:38] things down if he's built up a tiredness
[1:06:41] in your body there's a supernatural
[1:06:43] strength that can come into you Amen to
[1:06:45] make you pray Amen to make you Amen to
[1:06:47] bring your home amen under subjection of

[1:12:38] in the times of trouble no matter what
[1:12:39] it is amen amen there's an absolute that

[1:13:10] to live amen TI to an absolute and that
[1:13:13] will bring us through amen thank you
[1:13:16] Lord Moses's parents we look
[1:13:21] here they were parents who knew the
[1:13:23] promise of God for for
[1:13:25] deliverance in
[1:13:27] Genesis God told Abraham thy seed shall
[1:13:30] be a stranger in a land that is not
[1:13:33] theirs and they shall serve them and
[1:13:35] they shall afflict them for 400 years
[1:13:38] and he said in that Nation shall I judge
[1:13:41] and I will bring them out with great
[1:13:43] substance and so this family a family of
[1:13:46] prayer they had prayed for that promise
[1:13:48] of God to come to pass amen they were
[1:13:51] looking for it to come to pass in their
[1:13:54] generation and so this was a family that
[1:13:57] wasn't that didn't bend to the things of
[1:13:59] the world they didn't bend to the king's
[1:14:01] what the king said amen they were not
[1:14:04] willing and I want you to get this this
[1:14:06] morning they were not willing Amen to
[1:14:08] allow their child to be sacrificed as
[1:14:11] parents we have a responsibility Amen to
[1:14:14] commit and raise our children in the
[1:14:16] fear of God Amen to respect the house of
[1:14:19] God Amen I say what they see they will
[1:14:22] do what they see in us that's what
[1:14:24] they're going to mimic
[1:14:25] amen if we tend to drift towards the
[1:14:27] things of the world that's what they're
[1:14:29] going to do but if we put an emphasis on
[1:14:31] the things of God and the faithfulness
[1:14:33] and the faithfulness of God will bring

[1:16:34] the scene and when you're looking for
[1:16:36] those things that's when God can reveal
[1:16:39] his plan to you amen and she knew that
[1:16:42] the time was now that they should be
[1:16:43] delivered and he said and the Holy
[1:16:45] Spirit of my opinion revealed to her

[1:17:09] the message if you're a son or a
[1:17:11] daughter of God you were in God all the

[1:17:25] and living God Amen to vindicate the
[1:17:27] true and living God of this hour the

[1:17:53] in this hour
[1:17:57] yes
[1:18:01] sir thank you so the
[1:18:05] mother she wasn't afraid of the king's
[1:18:08] commandment they're being revealed to
[1:18:11] her that that her son would be the
[1:18:13] deliverer so she she committed him to
[1:18:16] God she committed him to the basket to
[1:18:21] the
[1:18:21] river the Bible says that I slammed it
[1:18:25] she sealed it and there she she placed
[1:18:28] her son her child in the jaws of the of
[1:18:31] the of the crocodiles there but she had
[1:18:34] a revelation of the plan of God and so
[1:18:37] that's what I'm trying to get to if we

[1:18:41] get a revelation of the plan of God no
[1:18:44] matter what you're going through amen no

[1:19:25] persuaded that neither death nor life
[1:19:26] nor angels nor principalities nor powers
[1:19:29] nor things present nor things to come
[1:19:31] nor he nor death or any creature shall
[1:19:33] be able to separate us from the love of
[1:19:35] God that which is in Christ Jesus our
[1:19:38] lord that's the confidence of the
[1:19:40] believer in this hour that's the
[1:19:42] confidence of the Christian in this hour
[1:19:44] that God's going to bring me through no
[1:19:46] matter what take takes place the prophet
[1:19:50] said here he said I found in my life
[1:19:51] Journey especially in my Ministry when
[1:19:53] Satan makes a big fight he knows there's

[1:20:18] hard on you he will bring every
[1:20:20] Temptation your way he'll put you amen
[1:20:22] and and God allows us to go through

[1:20:31] confidence this morning that God will

[1:21:35] liberty in Jesus Christ for those that

[1:21:48] deliver from the teaching of his mother
[1:21:52] and he trained himself in military might
[1:21:53] to do so but but he failed he had the
[1:21:57] understanding he had the education but
[1:22:00] that didn't work so he had to forget it

[1:22:03] taking God at his word and then God
[1:22:07] delivered the people yes sir so amen

[1:22:13] intellectual Faith as we've said many

[1:22:19] something that anchors down it's got to
[1:22:21] be something that's real amen it's got
[1:22:22] to be more than your own power power

[1:22:30] say the Lord amen this mountain shall be
[1:22:33] removed amen it's by his spirit it's by
[1:22:36] his power Moses couldn't go down there
[1:22:38] and do nothing he understood that there
[1:22:40] was a Deliverance he understood that
[1:22:42] there was a promise but it took God
[1:22:44] through Moses and it'll take God through
[1:22:46] you and I Amen to come out of this this
[1:22:49] olday the see an age it'll take God and

[1:23:05] things amen you've got to meet God on

[1:23:15] Bible says it was a bush that didn't
[1:23:17] burn and it attracted the
[1:23:19] prophet but it was the voice that came
[1:23:22] from the sign the fire that instructed
[1:23:26] the prophet amen the fire the Bush was a
[1:23:30] sign we can go out and we can see all
[1:23:32] kind of bushes burning or
[1:23:34] whatever but it's a voice that comes
[1:23:37] from the fire amen that stabilizes you
[1:23:40] that it gives you the understanding it
[1:23:42] gives you the confidence amen and when
[1:23:44] that meeting takes place amen it takes
[1:23:46] away all fear it removes all doubt amen
[1:23:49] because it takes away I can't because
[1:23:51] it's a God Amen that goes with you and
[1:23:54] in

[1:23:59] experience we've got to have an
[1:24:01] experience amen amen not just an
[1:24:03] understanding but you've got to meet the
[1:24:05] god that made the promise in this hour
[1:24:08] the Bible says when the spirit of truth
[1:24:09] shall come he will show you all things
[1:24:12] amen when he comes when you meet that
[1:24:14] God when you have that experience amen
[1:24:16] when you've met that Pillar of Fire amen

[1:24:20] Lord and then you can stand on the face
[1:24:22] of the enemy unmovable unshakable amen
[1:24:26] anden you can stand and say no weapon

[1:24:30] every tongue that shall rise against me
[1:24:32] in judgment I shall condemn amen amen
[1:24:35] you are part of the word and the word is
[1:24:37] part of you amen and you become the word
[1:24:39] made
[1:24:41] flesh amen and that's defeat defeated
[1:24:43] Satan on every ground amen we'll try to
[1:24:46] wer down here try to give you a little
[1:24:49] Grace this
[1:24:51] morning amen been a while since I
[1:24:54] preached
[1:24:55] so we're just getting back in the swing
[1:24:56] of things here
[1:25:00] amen amen we've been working under the
[1:25:02] task Masters out working you know we got
[1:25:06] to we got to provide we got to make a
[1:25:08] way amen but amen nothing should take
[1:25:11] place of the house of God or the things
[1:25:12] of God Amen what he's called us to do
[1:25:16] Exodus 5
[1:25:17] And1 and afterward Moses and Aaron went
[1:25:20] and told Pharaoh thus say the Lord God
[1:25:22] of Israel let my people go that they may
[1:25:24] hold a feast unto me in the wilderness
[1:25:29] Pharaoh would say who is the Lord that I
[1:25:32] should let his people go I know not this
[1:25:35] God neither will I let his people go but
[1:25:38] see they wanted to go worship the god of
[1:25:41] their
[1:25:42] fathers he told him he said get you to
[1:25:44] your burdens get back get go on get so
[1:25:49] he he would begin to make it hard on
[1:25:50] them he he took away the straw to make
[1:25:53] bricks and it would cause him to have to
[1:25:55] work even more cause them to be under uh
[1:25:58] that much more anguish anguish but when
[1:26:01] God begins to bring deliverance and the
[1:26:04] holy spirit amen begins to move that's
[1:26:06] when the devil tries to make it harder
[1:26:08] on you amen but we've been called To
[1:26:10] Worship in this hour we've been called
[1:26:12] to a feast of the word amen we've been
[1:26:14] called To Worship under the mighty hand
[1:26:16] of God I believe that there's a God on
[1:26:18] the scene this morning Pharaoh wanted a
[1:26:21] compromise he went on he wanted to
[1:26:23] compromise
[1:26:24] won't you just leave for a few days you
[1:26:26] know you can go out you know go where
[1:26:28] you want to go but leave your wives
[1:26:31] leave your children leave your cattle
[1:26:35] leave here and go without them and so
[1:26:38] that's just what the devil does he wants
[1:26:39] to make a compromise I say don't
[1:26:42] compromise with the world in this hour
[1:26:44] don't compromise with science don't
[1:26:46] compromise with intellectual faith that
[1:26:48] says it's this way amen if you know the
[1:26:50] plan of God stick to the plan of God if
[1:26:53] God's anointed you in this hour to be
[1:26:55] the Bride of Jesus Christ amen take what
[1:26:57] he said about you and be
[1:27:01] that so he knew that that if all their
[1:27:06] possessions were still in Egypt that
[1:27:08] they would have to come back that their
[1:27:10] heart would still be in Egypt right
[1:27:13] that's right and so there can't be
[1:27:15] anything that draws you and I back when

[1:27:20] understand we're not leaving nothing
[1:27:21] behind anden we're taking everything

[1:27:25] Israel got ready at midnight they had
[1:27:27] everything they had in this world packed

[1:27:32] Revival like that we pack up everything
[1:27:34] and Let It Go Go ye out to meet him he
[1:27:37] said you better be packed up not have

[1:27:47] god Till Pharaoh got so excited may not
[1:27:49] he said get out get out am man take
[1:27:52] everything and go and go he said I I'm
[1:27:55] so thankful that a man can live so close
[1:27:57] to God that the devil don't know what to
[1:27:59] do with him amen if you'll begin to make
[1:28:01] preparations if you'll begin to make
[1:28:03] things right amen the devil just I I

[1:28:31] with the strong hand he shall let them
[1:28:34] go and with a strong hand he shall drive
[1:28:36] them out of his land and God spake unto
[1:28:39] Moses and said un him I the Lord I
