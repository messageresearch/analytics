[49:48] hear him preach but it's been so long
[49:50] ago I can't even remember what he
[49:51] preaches like so but uh but I've heard
[49:54] brother brother Keith is a fabulous
[49:56] speaker and I've heard him online a
[49:58] couple of times I think but um and and
[50:01] he's he's loved by this church over the
[50:04] years and and been a friend to the
[50:06] church so we're glad to have him back
[50:08] with us today and a little bit of a
[50:09] homecoming so I've asked him to take his
[50:11] time and and just preach the word to us
[50:14] and then when he's done uh we're going
[50:15] to have some peace in things if you want

[50:48] Keith's from Jamaica so you have to ask
[50:50] him about that after the service and
[50:52] what that's like that'd be exciting to

[53:15] homecoming I love you and love to be in

[53:43] because but um I just love the body of
[53:46] Jesus Christ amen and I'm glad to be
[53:49] here with you um
[53:51] actually we were in uh South Carolina in
[53:55] in July and um you know the two brothers
[53:58] I was with Brother Joseph hammed and
[54:00] brother Isaiah Brooks we preached
[54:02] together and we made a plan that um in
[54:05] November the 1st and the second week I'm
[54:08] going to come again and uh I'm going to
[54:10] be there in Tennessee and then in Idaho
[54:14] and um you know uh in the mid midst of
[54:17] all that as we made the plan brother
[54:19] Brooks you know had changed the plan so
[54:21] you know I was thinking whether to go
[54:23] back home I said uh-uh I've not been
[54:25] here since
[54:26] 2018 and I'm coming here amen so I told
[54:30] Brother Joseph I said you set the ticket
[54:32] the way you're setting it because I'm
[54:34] coming to Arkansas and so I'm here
[54:37] amen God knows exactly what he's
[54:40] doing Hallelujah so we just thank him
[54:43] and we thank him for the word that has
[54:45] brought us together amen praise God we
[54:48] thank you for the love that we have one
[54:50] for the other and nothing can change
[54:53] that love amen
[54:55] there there's something about true love
[54:58] where nothing can change it amen praise
[55:00] God so amen just glad to be here with
[55:02] you and my wife traveling with me um I I
[55:05] would love to have my children traveling
[55:07] with me but um I don't I don't know if I
[55:10] should call them children or young women
[55:12] or so but they're
[55:14] gone so you know the nest is empty uh we
[55:18] thank God we talk every day and we keep
[55:20] in touch every day or many times for the
[55:23] day but um the experience is
[55:27] different and um it's one of the
[55:30] negative of us living into a third world
[55:32] country where there's not enough um
[55:35] opportunity for our young people you
[55:37] know they leave college and they're
[55:39] moving to the up north and so and so I
[55:42] guess we have about 10 of them young
[55:43] ones there in Canada because Canada has
[55:46] really opened the doors for them and
[55:49] we're we're sad and we're happy because
[55:51] we want to see them move on you know and
[55:54] be happy also but we we thank God for
[55:57] all
[55:58] things just thanking God that there's a
[56:00] day when we'll never part we'll always
[56:03] be together
[56:05] amen so as we go to the word this
[56:09] evening I'd like us to turn a Bibles to
[56:11] the book of Colossians chapter 1 just
[56:13] love that
[56:23] scripture
[56:32] and I'd like to speak on the background
[56:34] of the Bride being the manifestation of
[56:37] Jesus Christ amen because that's what
[56:39] she hears amen praise
[56:43] God so let us just bow our heads as we
[56:46] find
[56:47] it our gracious God and our father want
[56:50] to thank you for this privilege again to
[56:51] be in your house Lord It's not because
[56:55] of our goodness but because of you and
[56:58] so Lord God we pray that Lord God as we
[57:01] turn back the pages oh God may you bring
[57:03] forth the bread of life to us that Lord
[57:05] we might feed on the Eternal Body word
[57:08] of Jesus Christ Heavenly Father Lord God
[57:11] you know what your people stand in need
[57:13] of and we pray oh God that Lord the
[57:15] words that we speak might not just go
[57:17] void but Lord God may find Refuge oh God
[57:20] in the heart of your children the Lord
[57:23] God you would feed us you build that
[57:25] body around our Born Again experience
[57:28] because Lord God we know that we're
[57:30] working for the change of the body and
[57:32] Lord one of these days will come in the
[57:34] full statue of Jesus Christ and we're
[57:37] going to leave out of here so bless us
[57:39] now God as we look to your word father
[57:41] help us oh God to break that which we
[57:44] speak simply enough that our children do
[57:46] understand your word and be drawn closer
[57:49] to you we thank you God for our precious
[57:52] brother Joe and sister Mandy that has
[57:54] been been catering for us oh God and
[57:56] having given us that experience to bring
[57:58] us here this evening may you fill their
[58:01] store basket oh God with all that they
[58:02] stand in need of and Lord God we pray
[58:05] that the bride of Christ oh God will
[58:08] manifest your word we pray believing in
[58:11] Jesus Christ amen and
[58:16] amen you know winter is not my
[58:21] time it's just not my time I guess it's
[58:24] the first time I've travel this time of
[58:25] year so you're seeing me in a strange
[58:29] season amen Colossians 1 and verse2 to
[58:35] 18 giving thanks unto the Father which
[58:39] has made us meet to partak us of the
[58:42] inheritance of the Saints in
[58:45] light who has delivered us from the
[58:48] power of darkness and has translated us
[58:51] into the kingdom of his dear son in whom
[58:55] we have Redemption through his blood the
[58:57] Forgiveness of sins who is the image of
[59:01] the invisible God oh yeah the firstborn
[59:04] of every creature for by him were all
[59:07] things created that are in heaven that
[59:11] are in Earth visible and invisible
[59:15] whether they be Thrones or dominions or
[59:17] principalities or Powers all things were
[59:20] created by Him and for him and he is
[59:23] before all things
[59:25] and by him all things consist and he is
[59:29] the head of the body the church who is
[59:32] the beginning the firstborn from the
[59:34] dead that in all things he might have
[59:39] the preeminence may the Lord at his
[59:41] Blessing to the word you may be
[59:46] seated you know brother brandom used the
[59:48] scripture when he preached Christ The
[59:51] Mystery of God revealed yes and I
[59:54] believe that that was not just a a
[59:57] message uh that comes in the series of
[59:59] anything else I think he preached it
[1:00:01] once but you know I I even look at the
[1:00:04] time that that message was preached it
[1:00:08] was uh the the seventh month and the
[1:00:11] 28th day I think it is significance
[1:00:15] because when he preached Christ The
[1:00:17] Mystery of God reveal he was actually
[1:00:20] preaching the seventh seal yes because
[1:00:23] the seventh seal brings him back to
[1:00:26] Earth in word form that's right now
[1:00:29] there in Christ The Mystery of God
[1:00:30] revealed brother bam said that Christ
[1:00:33] might reveal himself completely in Jesus
[1:00:37] Christ so all the godhead dwell in
[1:00:41] Christ bodily and I cannot see how
[1:00:44] somebody could read a passage like
[1:00:47] Colossians chapter 1 and do see that
[1:00:50] Christ is God made manifest come on
[1:00:54] Hallelujah
[1:00:55] because the Bible says he's the image of
[1:00:58] the invisible God he's a first born from
[1:01:02] the dead thank in other words Lazarus
[1:01:05] came from the dead in a corruptible body
[1:01:08] but when Christ came from the dead he
[1:01:11] come in a body that is
[1:01:13] Incorruptible can die no more can sin no
[1:01:16] more sin had no more dominion over him
[1:01:19] right he said Hallelujah not only is a
[1:01:23] firstborn but he's a creator of all
[1:01:26] things both things that are visible and
[1:01:30] invisible but the scriptures speak there
[1:01:33] that in all things he might have
[1:01:37] preeminence now if Christ is not God
[1:01:40] then God would take second place uh if
[1:01:43] Christ have preeminence but Christ must
[1:01:46] have preeminence because he not the
[1:01:49] third person he's not the second person
[1:01:52] he's not the first person but Christ is
[1:01:56] the person the Bible says in Colossians
[1:01:59] 2 for in him dwell all the fullness of
[1:02:02] the godhead bodily and the seventh angel
[1:02:06] messenger put it in that form he said
[1:02:09] all that God was uh he poured it into
[1:02:12] Christ uh and all that Christ was uh he
[1:02:15] poured it into you and I our brethren we
[1:02:18] living below privilege uh we still don't
[1:02:21] realize who we are am me that we are God
[1:02:24] God's ear on the face of the Earth by
[1:02:27] the revealed word of the hour
[1:02:30] amen hallelujah thank you Lord that God
[1:02:33] might reveal himself
[1:02:35] completely in Jesus Christ that Christ
[1:02:39] might have preeminence in the body of
[1:02:42] believer in other words not your wife
[1:02:45] not your husband not your children but
[1:02:48] Christ
[1:02:49] preeminence is first person in the body
[1:02:53] of believer but the third part is that
[1:02:56] he might take us back to Eden as if
[1:02:59] there is no fall and Brethren the
[1:03:02] message of the hour is to restore us
[1:03:05] back come on sir not into Pentecost not
[1:03:09] to the faith of the fathers but it's to
[1:03:11] restore us back to Eden before the fall
[1:03:16] are you there with me the meek shall
[1:03:18] inherit the earth Hallelujah soen they
[1:03:22] replac the first he said Christ is a
[1:03:25] revelation of God so if God is revealed
[1:03:29] to you who you know is Jesus Christ then
[1:03:32] in page 33 of Hallelujah Christ The
[1:03:35] Mystery of God revealed he said what is
[1:03:37] the Holy Ghost then it's the revelation
[1:03:40] of Jesus Christ personally to you in
[1:03:45] other words if you're born again you
[1:03:47] know who Jesus is is that right amen
[1:03:51] there listen if the Revelation is hid
[1:03:54] from you you you're never born again
[1:03:56] that is why we know that the birth
[1:03:59] Hallelujah the new birth in this age
[1:04:02] Hallelujah is to embrace the message of
[1:04:05] the hour amen because the Bible
[1:04:09] Hallelujah was there with us all these
[1:04:11] years uh but we're grouping in darkness
[1:04:13] uh until Christ break the word uh to you
[1:04:16] and I and how did he do it Hallelujah he
[1:04:20] didn't do it through Wesley he didn't do
[1:04:22] it through mut he didn't do it through
[1:04:24] Pentecost but there was a messenger that
[1:04:27] was sent to you and I is that right and
[1:04:30] in 1962 Hallelujah December he preached
[1:04:34] uh sir is this the time of the end uh
[1:04:37] when we talk about all the Mysteries uh
[1:04:40] amen that were sum from the scripture
[1:04:42] amen but he went beyond that is that
[1:04:45] right uh God Was preparing you and I to
[1:04:48] receive the word of God hallelujah not a
[1:04:52] word for church uh but a word to change
[1:04:54] Us in the image of Jesus Christ amen I
[1:04:59] personally believe uh that the word of
[1:05:01] God is bringing us to a position uh
[1:05:04] where one day we will look at one
[1:05:05] another and we see not you uh amen under
[1:05:08] the star you are born under or under the
[1:05:11] family lineage that you come from uh but
[1:05:13] what we see is Jesus Christ uh made
[1:05:16] manifest on the face of the Earth again
[1:05:19] yes sir hallelujah amen so in Christ the
[1:05:23] mystery said amen the first thing was uh
[1:05:26] that God wanted to reveal himself to the
[1:05:29] people amen he couldn't do it as a great
[1:05:33] Jehovah God who covered all space Time
[1:05:36] and Eternity he could not uh amen he is
[1:05:40] too great uh to ever be revealed to
[1:05:43] people because it would be too
[1:05:45] mysterious how could that great being
[1:05:48] amen that never did begin hallelujah
[1:05:51] amen after he went beyond the cycle
[1:05:54] of hundreds of billions and trillions
[1:05:56] and trillions of years uh amen of light
[1:05:59] space uh amen and on out into it into
[1:06:02] Infinity amen hallelujah he said he love
[1:06:06] father wood thank you Lord amen for he
[1:06:09] was a father hallelujah amen and the
[1:06:12] only way he could be a father is to
[1:06:15] express as the son of man is that right
[1:06:19] amen you notice it said John 1 the Bible
[1:06:21] said in the beginning was the word and
[1:06:25] the Word was with God and the Word was
[1:06:28] God H said it same was in the beginning
[1:06:31] with God but he said and the Word was
[1:06:34] made
[1:06:36] flesh is that right and we beheld his
[1:06:39] glory now note these words uh the glory
[1:06:43] as of as of the Holy begotten of the
[1:06:47] father oh yeah Hallelujah so that
[1:06:50] condescending of God we could not Behold
[1:06:53] Him as God
[1:06:54] no sir so we Behold Him as a Son of God
[1:06:59] sir our Fin and Ms Hallelujah could not
[1:07:03] comprehend him as a great Jehovah God
[1:07:06] Amen standing in our mids uh so God gave
[1:07:09] us that amen but there's a day coming uh
[1:07:12] amen when all the fullness uh of the
[1:07:14] goded bodily is going to be in the Brad
[1:07:17] uh and we are going to see as he is uh
[1:07:21] oh and when we see as he is uh what a
[1:07:23] change
[1:07:24] that's going to bring to you and I he's
[1:07:26] going to change our body he's going to
[1:07:28] change our minds he's going to change
[1:07:31] our action he's going to change our
[1:07:33] thinking uh he's going to change
[1:07:34] everything uh that God can be all in all
[1:07:38] yes sir what is this that God is
[1:07:40] bringing to has brought to us we're not
[1:07:43] feeding on the words of each other we're
[1:07:45] not feeding on the words of men no sir
[1:07:49] we're feeding on the living come on now
[1:07:52] body word of the son of man Jesus Christ
[1:07:57] amen and the pattern through which God
[1:07:59] Amen chose to do this to us uh Amen
[1:08:01] brother bramus amen laid out these
[1:08:04] things to you and I amen he Hallelujah
[1:08:06] first part of the message uh He restored
[1:08:09] the faith of the fathers is the right
[1:08:12] and in the restoration of the faith of
[1:08:14] the fathers uh me we know that we are
[1:08:16] born into the kingdom of God Amen by our
[1:08:19] faith is a right uh and Peter laid it
