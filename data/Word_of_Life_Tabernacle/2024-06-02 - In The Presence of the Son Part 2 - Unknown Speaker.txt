need or spiritual need Lord we know only you can do it I pray Lord you would quieten me I pray you'd take me out of the way Lord and speak directly to your people today we pray in Jesus name amen amen Mark chapter 4 and verse 26 Mark 4 and 26 I want to continue a little bit on what we were talking about last week and I trust it'll be a blessing to you says Jesus speaking he said so is the kingdom of God as if a man should cast seed into the ground it should sleep and arise night and day and the seed should spring and grow up he knoweth not how for the Earth bringeth forth fruit of herself first the blade then the ear after that the full corn in the ear when the fruit is brought forth immediately he putteth in the sickle because the Harvest is come PR Lord would have his Blessing to the word you may be seated I want to speak to you on in in the presence of the Sun the word corn in the King James version is not corn like a like a sweet corn that we would have today in fact they didn't even have that whenever you see corn in the King James version is actually grain the word is grain it it means uh actually a a wheat or it could be another type of grain it means the seed the seed of grain and so uh it has a general meaning of grain we found in the parable that the wheat grows in a certain way that it's a very specific process that every time wheat grows it grows the same way right it comes up and then it it it comes up from the earth and it's it's a stalk it's a it produces a husk it produces the Grain and so this is the way Jesus put it and reading from a different version where it calls it grain it says by itself the soil produces a crop first the grass then the head of grain then the full grain in the head the full grain in the head church that's where we are right we're at the time of the full grain in the head we're not in the time of the preparation we're not in the time of when the grain is is still coming out of the ground we're not even in the time of the former rain or the latter rain or any of those things we're living in the time of the Harvest we in fact we're not only in the Harvest we're at the very end of the Harvest so we're looking at a time and I I want us to recognize my purpose I I would say in doing this as I've been inspired to this is so we would recognize where we are so we would know what do we expect in our hour what should we expect to be happening we should not expect the church world to be in Revival we should not expect the world in in general uh to have rain falling on it or America to be turning back to God that's not the hour we're living in but we're living at the very end of the end when the grain comes to its fullness and that's what we ought to be producing in our lives oh Church we're not producing a Methodist a Methodist grain or a Baptist season or or a Pentecostal season we're producing a bride season of the word in its fullness and so what that means is that we are producing the life of Jesus Christ in the earth that we live in today and I'm thankful for that I'm thankful for clarity I'm thankful that this message didn't come to confuse us further but this message come to tell us who we are and where we are how many believe that this morning amen aren't you glad aren't you glad we can we can still you know there's a lot of things we do as a church but but ultimately what are we here for we're here to express Christ and let the Deacon be an expression of Christ in his Deacon work let the pastors be an expression of Christ in their work Let the church be an expression of Jesus Christ in their everyday lives and you I express Christ here in the Pulpit but I express him at home to my family you express him at your work you express him at home with your wife or with your husband what is it it's a manifestation of of what God wants and I believe that the full grain has coming this hour what that means is that we are to manifest completely and produce a bumper crop Jesus said some would produce tfold or 50-fold but this hour We're supposed to produce H hundredfold right H hundredfold what is that it means that we're going to come fully to what God intended for a bride to be when he saw the Gentile bride in his mind he saw what we would be all right and that gives us great responsibility today we're not looking back to another age to see what they were or looking back to another time to see well maybe I can be like them or looking back at another place say well I wish it was like it used to be but what can I be today I have the potential of being the fullness of the word so I have the responsibility of displaying that in my life yeah so we're not waiting on something else to happen or he said brother Ben if I could only have a certain preacher come by boy I'd really I'd really worship then I'd really manifest the word of God then I tell you today's the day today's the day to worship God today's the day to manifest the word today is the day to be what God called you to be not tomorrow let's do it today let's not wait till tomorrow say well someday I'm going to really serve God I'm going to really give him my all why not give him your all today this is the Harvest Time amen so we know that as we said last uh week in Joel 223 it spoke of a former rain and a latter rain in the same season it's giv you the former rain moderately he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month in the springtime in the beginning of Summer and so brother brandham speaks of it as future when he talks about it in some places in the message he says he talks about the ladder rain said what they're trying to do they're trying to manufacture a lad rain he's talking about those that went to gifts instead of staying with the word right and they just went into gifts and began to promote gifts instead of stand with the word we believe in the gifts but that's not our message right our message is the fullness it's the gifts plus the healing plus the Salvation plus justification sanctification it's all of it amen that's the hour that we live in our message is all of it so so we don't promote just one part of it we promote all of it so so what they're trying to do is they're trying to manufacture a latter rain nonsense he said why the latter rain will sweep the world brother been a former rain he said been a former rain sewing words that's right now you'll see what the latter rain produces you'll find out there'll be an affiliation the Pentecost Pentecostals and all the groups will come together and they'll shut the doors on them guys that won't listen to it he said you won't even be allowed to open your mouth he said that's when he'll come that's when he'll show that's when you'll see a rain he said oh my lay still be quiet let it go now brother brand was talking about something coming but he says something similar about the manifestation of the third pole we need to understand these things because people come out and they say well you know there there's there's something coming there's a there's a latter rain coming there's a third pole coming and they even will take quotes and say well brother random said this was coming but I want you to notice how he says it and what he says is we look at it when he says it as we look at it in order he says this about the manifestation of the third pole right at this time now it's just happened he said so it could identify its presence among you but it will not be used in a great way until this Council begins to tighten up he said and when it does when that does the Pentecost and so forth can almost impersonate anything can be done but when that time comes when the squeeze comes down and you'll see what you've seen temporarily be manifested in the fullness of its power now if I took a if you've been in the message very long and I took a poll this morning or a vote and and had you write down how many times that you thought brother brandom said the word squeeze in this context in the message I wonder how many times that would be because I've heard it all my life preached on the squeeze right I've heard preached on you know how many times brother brandham says it you're looking at it that's the only time brother brandham uses the word squeeze in reference to them closing the doors at least the only time I ever found brother B uses the term squeeze in reference to them closing the doors now we know the doors could be closed because we saw that in covid right and we've seen people voluntarily close their doors just quit having church it's a spirit in this age but yet so we know that could happen and yet brother brand was talking about something there will be a time coming now he said and then you'll see what you've seen temporarily be manifested in the fullness of its power now keep that in your mind and then we're going to go a little bit further brother brandham as he as he gets into 1964 there's a great change in brother Brand's Ministry because he realizes something that he's never realized before now I know this is real technical this morning but we're going somewhere so brother bam recognizes the truth that he didn't know before now first of all you've got to you you got to be willing to admit that the message that brother Bram had was Progressive that he didn't know it all at once right right because he didn't know the seals he said I was about to make a terrible mistake and the angel of the Lord I don't believe it's our job or my job to correct a prophet right right it's my job just to believe what he said right right it's my job to believe what he said I don't correct him but we do allow him to correct himself right and and it's not even to say that that which he preached before was wrong but it's to say that it's to say that what happened is the Angel of the Lord brought him up higher in Revelation it wasn't that it was wrong but brother brandham thought that the trumpets were to the church brother brandom he he told us he was going to preach the trumpets remember and then he preached a sermon called the Feast of the trumpets and he said I'm not going to preach the trumpets because the trumpets are to the Jews yeah right but he preached the Feast of the trumpets and under those trumpets you find in Revelation 9 and Revelation 9:14 specifically and and on down there were 200 million demons you remember that loose which had been bound in the river Euphrates that's a a persecution that's these demons are coming in persecution they were loose brother bham taught us on the Jews under Hitler en nightman how many know brother bham taught that under Hitler enitan they were released and loosed on the Jews and then they were he said to be released in Ecclesiastes IAL realm or an ecumenical realm on the bride so the loosing on the bride was in this ecclesiastical realm brought on by The ecumenical movement and those are big words I know they the children asked me to use uh words they could understand so ecumenical just means uh uh everybody together right it's a gathering of the churches it's it's all the churches together ecclesiastical just means the clergy the church the people religion so it's in a it's a persecution in a religious realm brought on by The ecumenical movement now watch what brother Bram says about this he said now the ecclesiastical realm has been open from the natural Revival of the old Pagan realm went forth on those Jews always been their enemy the lying with teeth and everything it stomped down and broke out the people he said Rome has always been God's enemy it was turned loose In The Same Spirit by the dictators of the world because the religious system was still holding so he's saying in in a natural way it was released on Hitler and itman right or on the Jews through them but now the religious system was still holding now watch what he says brother Brandon begins to teach this in 1964 is everybody awake this morning everybody with me brother Brandon begins to teach this and what does he begin to teach us he said look he said uh he said now it's been losos when then now it's been loosed what has it done right in the coming as he said he come in like flatteries what has he done he's bringing the Protestant ecumenical council of the world churches the spirit of antichrist upon both of them bringing them to the slaughter just like they did the other in the hour to call the bride how loosed in the ecclesiastical Church Spirit loosed upon what not upon the denominations upon the bride he said but here you'll get it oh I love this now watch he just said it's been loosed on the bride so you said oh get ready they're going to close the doors but look what he says the bride will not go through that time all right right so he's looking for something to come right and then he says no that's to the Jews and remember the quote we l last or we read last week he said the rain is over and he dealt with it with the Jews he said the rain is over the former and the latter rain have come what are we doing we're laying in the presence of the Sun the bride will not go through that time right the Bible says not the church will but not the bride right he said can't you see ministers can't you see that Brethren you say the church has to go through the persecution for the Perfection of it the blood of Jesus Christ perfects the bride aren't you glad for that today listen I don't even perfect the bride I we we preach for the maturity of the bride and the and the completeness of the Bride but the blood is what perfects the bride sir you're perfected by the blood this morning because I can't make you without sin but the blood can make you without sin yes sir so now he again he and you can read it all I don't have time to read it all brother Brown deals with this in length in the Feast of the trumpets he said notice there she is now she's loosed to call all these now what she Loos to do now watch he said it would come in in flatteries see it's in a spiritual realm a religious realm she's loosed that person tion's on everybody's waiting on the persecution it's on it's happened if there's ever been a time we need to get right with God today's today everybody looking for a squeeze it's on right are you with me now but in the spiritual realm but before it comes in a natural realm we'll be gone right so there will come a time they they may close the doors of churches like this but not while the bride's here right in chrisis the mystery of God revealed we haven't got to it yet in that sermon brother brand said before they can shut us up he'll he'll take us up right amen amen I'm so glad for that promise so I believe we'll still be able to have church until the day that we go home I believe somehow we may be under pers you say persecution is coming well it's there in different parts of the world right but but no matter what happens in the political system we're going to be able to fulfill the commission of God preach Go in all world and preach the gospel to Every Creature listen it would illegal to be a CHR Christian in the first church in the early church but they still preach they still had Church they still love one another they still gathered together yeah and you say Well it it could come to that but listen he said before it comes to that we go home oh I just love that see we don't Place ourselves as foolish virgin the bride he's coming to a point in his ministry where he's telling us there's a difference in the bride and the church there's a difference in brother Brandon being called to do that he's separating the bride the church and the foolish virgin the foolish virgin goes through that tribulation period right if you're foolish virgin today you need to be getting ready for a tribulation but God didn't call me to be a foolish virgin I don't like to be foolish I want to be wise and I believe he's called me to be wise I believe he's called me to be the bride and in order to be the bride it means that I skip the tribulation period right I've been I I'm caught up in a rapture so brother Ben what are you looking for I'm looking for the world to continue to be rich and increased in goods and say I have need of nothing for they to see it and continue to go on like it is then one day it stops and you can see the precursors to it you can see things that have happened and almost like a trial run for something coming you can see those things happening but it want it's held off what's it held by by you he that now lth will let until he's taken out of the way what is that the Holy Ghost in you oh aren't you glad there's something in you that's holding back the things that are coming on this Earth until you go home yes now are you with me so far I and you may not agree with me on this but I believe it's what a prophet taught her I wouldn't preach it now look brother brandom said he said that's he said notice there she is she's loose to call all these little Loose Ends oh well don't make any difference anyhow well it don't make any difference if we go to church all right don't make any difference if we cut our hair or not or what how we dress or how we look or don't make any difference what we believe about baptism that's the the squeeze that we feel that's the press that we're going through right I'm not looking for them listen if they told us tomorrow people are so fed up with that stuff if they told us tomorrow we couldn't have church I think pretty much all of you'd be in church I got no confidence in you you I that's all right I I believe you come to the house of God you you'd want to serve the Lord with all your heart in spite of persecution what gets us for the Joel what is it that that bothers Us in this hour it's not people telling us we can't do something it's people telling us oh why don't you watch this why don't you go here why don't you why don't you participate in this what keeps us out of church is not locks on the door [Applause] right I need to get back to my notes is that right what keeps us out of church is the L to see an age that's what keeps people out of the house of God it's not somebody coming locking the door it's people people just not being where they need to be with God say God help us today look look he he said That's what Satan said to Eve don't make any difference it's all right surely God is a good god he loves us all he said he doesn't that's right right you hear so much about it being a good god he's a good God but being good he has to be just there's no goodness without Justice there's no justice without no law without punishment penalty he said so we're in that hour that we're living he goes on he talks about crev and Eisenhower and the iron and the clay all the things that have happened he said but thank God the little bride has made herself ready it ain't long just hold on it won't be long he said I don't know how long don't know when nobody knows that but we know it's close now real so he he's preparing us he's separating the what what was seen for the for the foolish version What was seen for the Jews and what is seen for the bride so the very next month in questions and answers what we read to you last week I'll just read part of it he said I believe you're seeing the last thing someone say last thing that will happen to the church before the Rapture that next quote the last thing if I put it in there uh that will happen to the church before the Rapture that's exactly I believe it he said the rain is over the rain is over what does that mean again we explained it last week it don't mean there's no moisture it means the moisture is on the inside right there's water but it's coming out from under the throne that's what he said it's not the general rain falling on the population but it's something within the seed that causes it to mature in a dry time yes oh my the full summer sun has come out in our day all right let's look look at Luke 21: 29 this really blessed me when I saw it I hope you're ready to have church this morning did you come to have church I didn't come just to show up we come to have church this morning we might as well enjoy it right in the house of God now look in Luke 21:29 he spake to them a parable behold the Fig Tree and all the trees when they now shoot forth you see and know of your own selves that summer is now n at hand now remember in their timeline their Harvest was not in the fall but in the late summer actually it began in the early summer it begins in May and it goes through the hottest time of the year when the sun is at its full strength and and and harvest is really on the wheat Harvest is really on about June so brother brand said this about that he and he says that that fig tree is the Jewish Nation right we all understand that it's a Jewish Nation Israel become a nation May 14th 1948 the Fig Tree put forth its butt we can look at that and say that's history that happened we're not waiting on the Fig Tree to put forth its Bud it already happened right we're not waiting on all the other trees to put forth their buds that already happened right so now watch but when that happened is in the spring about the time that the latter rain fell oh my and so that would they would have noticed the Fig Tree putting forth its Bud now brother brandham Ties That Day the date of his commission with the date Israel become a nation you've heard him do that he uses brother B actually uses different dates for it 1946 1947 and critics use that and I'm just being honest with you this morning they do they take that and they use it to say brother Brandon was a liar but something did happen in 1947 which Israel become a nation officially in 1948 that's when they celebrate independence day but in 1947 what brother Brown was talking about happening was the petition of Israel when the UN said that they could be a nation so brother Brandon says it this way and who is this he said Israel become a nation in 1947 the same night the angel of the Lord visited me when he came to me at 12:00 it was noon when they signed now watch when they signed that peace paact with the world the league of nation and so forth overseas it was the year before that they they had an independence day they still had to fight a war of independence right there still had was a lot of things had to happen before they could establish themselves nobody knew if they would win but the Lord helped them but it was the year before when they signed the peace Packa with the League of Nations in 1947 November 29th 1947 United Nations voted for the petition of the British Mandate of Palestine calling for the formation of a Jewish State and an Arab state the result was that the Jews accepted the deal the Arabs rejected it that's why we still have a fighting over there today so now here here was the former and the latter rain together the Fig Tree blooming so what what what's happening now if we can say that those things have happened what's taking place now oh Church the sun must be out in its full strength right it must be that's the hour that we're living in see brother BR said you said when the Fig Tree puts forth her buds no summer is n we see she is budding and we see all the other trees are budding we know it's near yes we see ishmail and Isaac Yonder at the Gate of each other's throat they still are aren't they just as you said every prophecy right now striking this is in 1957 yeah said God be merciful and save the Lost now watch he said the Fig Tree and all the other trees now in other words he said there'd be a universal Revival at the time when was there a universal Revival the last Universal Revival was the healing Revival that took place was Spar by Brother Brand's ministry right it was the Pentecostal Revival and then the healing Revival in 1947 started it we talked about how the latter rain movement come along during that time the Charismatic Church come out of that right everything was sparked from that that was the last Universal Revival brother r taught us at that ended in 1956 in Luke chap 21 and 31 Jesus goes on to say so likewise ye when you see these things come to pass know ye that the kingdom of God is not at hand verily I say unto you this generation shall not pass away till all be fulfilled what did he say summer is nigh when you see the Fig Tree putting forth its bud it's about time for the son yes right the s o n to come in his full strength right all Hallelujah so remember that was the time of harvest brother brand says we noticed before Springtime comes watch some of his laws when you see the trees putting forth buds he said you know that summer is nine Springtime is a sign of the introduction I love this of Summer coming on he said that's a law it always happens that way again he said remember we cannot live by yesterday's light yesterday's light is gone it isn't no more it's yesterday's light is only a memory yesterday's sunlight is only a memory or it's history we cannot live in yesterday's light no more and the same though it's the same Sun the same son but each day it brings forth its strength a little stronger oh I love that each day it brings forth its strength a little stronger to ripen the grain for the Harvest he said brother Ben what should I do if I want to really serve God in this age what should I do what should I be get into that word become that word live that word manif that word let that word and you become the same let it become a part of you the message was sent for a reason we can't live in yesterday's life but let that sun come a little stronger to you every day right the Sun comes today he said he said gets a little stronger each day now it'll get a little stronger a little stronger oh I believe that's the hour we're not where we were four years ago we're not where we were 20 years ago we're not where we were 50 years ago what is it the Sun every day coming on a Little Bit Stronger hallelujah hallelujah The Sun Comes A Little Bit Stronger a little stronger till finally the wheat that's laying there it'll go taking life all right see it doesn't take life from the wheat yeah but it actually gives life to the wheat are you with me now after a while the life will come up see it comes out of the stalk out of the husk it comes up then he said then a little stronger a little stronger March April May June July oh it's late Harvest by July what you doing in the land of Canaan is you're just going around and getting what was left yeah you're gleaning that's where we're at church especially here in America the Harvest it's coming to its end right we're at the downside of that March April May Jun you see what he saying it's a very clear teaching she's in the Harvest in you see the same sun shining today he said in January December that's when that's when he was preaching it he said that's up there bathing that snow and melting it down on that grain bringing it water it's the same Sun but that wheat could not live in that same sunlight in June it can't do it if you planted the wheat in June or July it would never come up because of the strength of the Sun at that time it's too hot so it has to become mature before it can oh Church before it can take the full strength of the sun well you know if you can't take this message in its fullness if if you're having a hard time living it if you're having a hard time accepting it in its fullness and and what it means to have a a profit in our day and things like that what you need is to come back to the fact you need to understand that you need to you need to lay in the presence of the son until you actually uh begin to get a revelation become sure enough to receive that kind of full strength right right you you've got to reach a place in your life you justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then you got to take another step yeah what is that it's our adoption the message of the hour it's coming in and becoming a mature Christian brother BR said you're not born a full born man right some of you young people you get discouraged because you say well I've not lived like I should some of you young Christians you say well I'm not doing everything right well nobody you know never seen a kid get up and and start a bank all right right kids don't get up and and and go to take the briefcase and go to work why they're not mature adults do but kids don't but but but here we we don't expect them to and you shouldn't expect yourself to but you do have to grow you can't stay in that stage forever forever brother Bon said don't knock a a kid down when he's trying to walk let him stumble let him walk don't don't don't say well you Never Walk Don't discourage him let him stumble but there comes a time we got to grow up and that's the hour that we're living in it's a time of of extreme growth within the seed and that's where I want to see the growth I love it when we see new people come I love to see the church fall but I want to see that extreme growth in the inside of the seed amen the first great sign in brother br's Ministry was on the river in 1933 in 1933 brother BR said I had a baptismal service in the middle of June the middle of June standing out there had been so hot for weeks hadn't had no rain for two or three weeks the country was burning up that voice come down and said as John the Baptist was sent forth to forerun the first coming of Christ so will your message forun the second coming of Christ what was it ladder rain so the full sun could come out are you with me now we we established last week what that was now almost every false Doctrine around this message comes from somebody not recognizing what season we're in that's right yeah right what season are we in it's time to be mature right and that's why and I'll say this you can't just keep making excuses he been in the message 40 years and say well I just you know I just can't hardly drag myself to to do what's right well you need the Holy Ghost you know at some point you skip the step right you need to be matured right right you you you don't need to keep making them mistakes all over again you've been around 40 years it's time to grow up right but now it's it's manifesting time summertime and and almost every false Doctrine comes from the fact people don't not recognizing what time we're living in I would say it's the end of sum time it's harvest time time to lay in the presence of the full word all right and to manifest what we are to be harvested in this hour see people are are still looking some people still looking for a fig tree to bloom looking for Israel to do something right Israel is ready to receive the message right they're they're in their Homeland they're ready yeah I'm not looking for Israel to do something I'm not looking for a Revival in and as far as a worldwide Revival I'm not I'm not talking about local Revival here I'm just talking about worldwide a worldwide Reign I'm not looking for that I'm not looking for return of a prophet I'm not looking for someone to bring more Revelation or someone to lead us you say well we're just waiting on Joshua to come brother brandham taught us his ministry typed Moses and Joshua right what he and he also told us Joshua was the Holy Ghost right so the Joshua is still here yeah to lead us in now he he said brother Brandon says this he said what time is it brother what time is it Minister do you see the time of the day and the sign that you're living under can you understand it do you see it everywhere now there's no Revival everybody is complaining ministers crying you realize what they're doing there's people today still in the message still under that I'm again I believe we should want Revival here in our local church we we should want God to move I believe that's the only place he is moving is in the bride yeah that's right but but we're not but we recognize nothing has to happen for that to happen right right it's here yeah Revival is for us it's here because it's within the seed the Revival that you need is right inside of you oh you young people you just understand what you need to be a real good Christian to be a mature Christian is already inside of you it just needs to manifest itself right that's right the Revival is within you where is the wst Revival he said I am the wst Revival so brother BR said everywhere now there's no Revival everybody's complaining Minister's crying you talked about the herald of his coming which was written by Jack Moore and how Jack Moore cried out we need to see a Revival and brother brand was just standing there and saying what you didn't see this imagine how that must have made brother brandom feel when Jack Moore's putting in his paper and printing we need a prophet we need Revival yeah he said you missed it yeah right I wonder how if a prophet would come back in our day I wonder how he would feel people looking at something to happen always he's he's going to do something else how would he feel about that they're crying for Revival all right right and not recognizing what's already happened what happened he said why did they do that they want a Great Awakening they're crying believing that there will be Awakening they're good people why is it what have they done they have not recognized The Awakening of the Bride come on by being a Christian they feel the pull of the hour they're Christians but they haven't recognized what's been done yes sir that's what's making them feel that way they know something is supposed to happen but see they're looking for it way off in the future to come when it's already happened right by you yes sir oh I believe that's the hour we're living in today it's already happened right by you yes again as we said brother Brandon's Ministry type Moses and Joshua going out and coming in the two parts to Redemption the two parts of the Exodus the first two polls of his ministry coming out the third pole going in a forerunner he he was a forerunner but he also introduced us to the word itself yes are you with me now so it wasn't just the ministry of the Forerunner it was also the ministry of Christ yeah right in the son of man now look the first two polls coming out the third poll going in a forerunner in the word itself the ending of a denominational age the beginning of the Bride age yes yes at the beginning of the harvest season there was a sheath waved right and I won't spend much time on this in fact I may skip through some of this but just so we understand the the Bible says there would be a sheath waved at the first fruits of the Harvest Leviticus 23:10 verse 11 he shall wave the sheath before the Lord to be accepted for you on the tomorrow after the Sabbath the priest shall wave it we know that Christ was that wave sheath brother random said it's not Su in anymore it's the s o n d a y the Sunday that that corn of wheat God's first one up from the dead is to be waved over the congregation that we are his seed and that's the first of those seed of those that slept waved upon the first day of the week yes he said notice it was the first corn of God's wheat that had been raised from the dead God's first corn of wheat that God's quickening power God had quickened his life raised him up from the dead and he was the first fruits of those that slept the first fruit he was that sheath he said that's why they had to wave that sheath for it was the first one to come to maturity and it was waved as a memorial of Thanksgiving to God believing the rest of them would come it was a sign he said he was waved on Easter he was waved again at Pentecost he said and to be waved again we realize in the last day according to Luke 17:30 in the so n day again in the day that the so n of man will be revealed or waved again over the people yes now who is the son of man that's where a lot of people get mixed up they say well brother Brandon was waved over the people no the word was waved over the people in brother brandom in you in me the word being waved over the people look and to be waved again in the last day who is the son of man in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us he said if all the teaching that we have in confirmation of the word of God by word of God by Signs by wonders we say today in the Book of Luke the 17th chapter and the 30th verse Malachi 4 the different scriptures we are acquainted with that the word again is waved over the people that the Dead traditions of man is dead the Son of God is alive again with the baptism of the Holy Spirit right Among Us and is giving us life yes sir that's where we're living the word has been raised and been waved over the people yes it has been yeah oh that's good oh my and it's being waved in our life right we'll get to that in a moment now look he said he said uh he Christ was the first one to raise from all the prophets and so forth though typed in many places he was the first fruits of those that slept and the bride coming of Christ coming out of the church there will have to be a sheath waved again in the last days where at in the bride Hallelujah the bride coming of Christ look waving in the sheath what was the sheath the first one that come to mature the first one that proved it was a wheat that proved it was a sheep he said Hallelujah I'm sure you see what I'm talking about it was waved over the people and the first time there will come forth for the bright age for Resurrection out of dark denominationalism will be a message that the full maturity of the word the full someone say full full maturity of the word what is the word the s o n oh my the full maturity of the word has turned back again in its full power and being waved over the People by the same signs and wonders he did back there you said well I'm looking for something to happen what are you looking for all right he's already come they said well Elijah must first come he said he already came yeah and they did with the message what they were meant to do with it yeah what seed was in them to do with it he's already come and we're living in that time of the of the quickening of the Bride now look he said because I live you live also speaking to his wife because I live you live also what a resurrection that was what a resurrection this is to be quickened from the dead to be made alive in Christ Jesus by God's quickening power he was waved to them the word which he was was waved back to them on the day of Pentecost the word made manifest he said now and as I say it's to be waved again in the last day that's good now watch I know people say well brother brandham waved it once brother brand will wave it again that's not what he's telling us Jesus waved it who waved it back 120 in the upper room huh if the wave sheath was Christ that happened on Passover that's when the wave sheath was raised the beginning of the Harvest what happens at Pentecost it's the wheat harvest the end of the wheat Harvest 50 days later it's the waving of loaves bread they've taken the wheat that has been harvested and made it into bread I know some of y'all Wonder said brother man why am I going through what I'm going through why do I have to be crushed why does it seem like the devil just come after me over and over and over again and you say brother brother Ben I don't understand it well you may not but remember you the the wheat has to be Crush in the mill to become bread you don't want to taste I know they have them them whole whole grain you know bread today and some of it man just tastes like eating eating cattle food give me some good old white bread you know CU it's just it's just full of oats and stuff there's nothing wrong with that you can eat that if you want to but but for me I like I like refined bread what does he want he wants bread that's been through the crusher bread that's been through been through the the mill and and the wheels have grounded together what's it doing it's producing something and no one can be bread until that's been produced in their life look on the Feast of P because what was to be to be raised Leviticus 23:7 what was to be waved you shall bring out of your habitation to wave loaves proof that the Harvest was successful all right oh yes the first wave sheath was oh my was just was proof there was a harvest coming yeah but the second wave sheath was proof of a successful Harvest yes the first wave sheep was showing Christ was among them he had risen from the dead on Easter morning but the second wave sheep was proven that what Christ was all that Christ was he poured into the church proving that the resurrection work proving he had Justified them by faith and filled them with the Holy Ghost that's good where are we living Church the brandham said but the wheat has to lay in the presence of the sun to ripen that's what we're here for friend stay in the presence of the sun till our little group of people here till it become so ripe to Christ it become Bread on his table see that's the time we live in this is the time of the full word the full son you say brother Ben I have a hard time understanding that just think with me for a moment and and think with your heart in your spirit and and and with that understanding that God's giv you that the end time message means something to you you need to thinking all these things that I go through in life are for a purpose because this is the full word the full son have wanting to produce itself in my life Galatians 4:30 tells us that the son of the Bond woman will not be air with the son of the free woman random to us in the seed do not air with the Shu that Mary was not the seed she was the carrier and that Pentecost was the shook that must pull away and I've got I could I could preach for five hours today and I won't I promise we can need to redo that election I tell you what brother ste's okay he's me redo the other part but where was I oh I'm not going to keep you forever but I'm quoting this stuff so I some of this stuff I'm just quoting but it's from quotes you understand I'm just telling you to save time and now I'm taking time but look brother Brandon said the Pentecost was the shuck how many know that which must pull away but the real genuine bride Church will bring forth how much the entire word of God oh brother Josh I take that as a prophecy I believe he he meant that when he said it the entire word of God in what in its fullness in its strength not barely making it by the skin of her teeth but the real genuine bright church will be in its fullness and in his strength he's the same yesterday today and forever oh hope we believe that today yes amen he was the full seed see brother B taught us he said Mary was not the full seed she the seed was in her she protected it but she was not the full seed she manifested a part of the word a virgin shall conceive just like Pentecost manifested a part of the word the restoration of the gifts there had to be a part of the word manifested but they did not manifest the full word Christ was the manifestation of the for word he come and said in the volume of the book it's written to me and you and I live in the day when the real genuine wine bride church is a manifestation of the full word look now he said but notice and this is in the seat is not air with the sh at the opening of The Seven Seals Revelation 10 the how much forward so again what am I waiting on well I'm waiting brother Ben to get ready I'll get ready when I hear somebody preach no get ready today I'll get ready when some a certain thing happens no time to get today yeah because the for word someone say the for word is to be born in a manifestation again and Vindicated by the spirit of God in what in the full strength yes as it was when he was here on Earth manifested in the same way doing the same things that it did when he was here on the Earth all right and he goes to Hebrews 138 and Luke 17:30 again what is he telling us summer is here in fact for the church the summer is over right they're facing Harvest I want you to watch something have you got a few more minutes to listen with me we're actually doing good on time now summer is here if you go back in the Book of Ruth you find that Ruth's courtship began at Barley season right brother brandham notes that he said it began at at Barley season at the beginning of the Harvest Ruth 122 say naom Naomi returned and Ruth the moabitas her daughter-in-law with her which returned out of the country of Moab and they came to Bethlehem when in the beginning of barley harvest the entire courtship of Ruth happens during the Harvest at the beginning of the Harvest she's a moabitas right and she commits herself to the word to Naomi and says where you go I'll go that's her legalistic phase right where you where you go I'll go Ruth committing herself to that and she goes to Bethlehem and it's the beginning of barley Harvest by the end of the wheat Harvest which The Barley Harvest happens and then the wheat Harvest then she's married to Boaz remember he was still threshing the the the barley and the wheat in the threshing floor when she went down and and and covered herself with his grace amen we could put it that way so Ruth's courtship began at Barley season in the beginning of barley Harvest look at Ruth 223 see she was gleaning in the field remember she she went she worked she had to work it was a season where she had to work and it says so she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz remember Naomi told her don't leave boaz's field and Boaz told her don't go in another field I've told the young men not to touch you he began to drop handfuls on purpose for her remember and so she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean when until the end a barley Harvest and wheat Harvest oh my amen that's good and dwelt with her mother-in-law what was she doing she was working serving brother brand said there's three stages of Ruth Ruth deciding she was deciding whether she'd make the decision or not to go back into the Homeland just like the church Ruth serving when she went out to glean Ruth resting Oh by when did she rest when he said I'll not rest what was he doing he was doing his claiming work I hope you can catch it church that was the hour of the opening of The Book of the opening of the seals he's doing his claiming work and he tells her he said you rest until I'm done with this work oh my that's when he went and remember took off they took off his shoe and and and and he the the near Kinsman couldn't do it couldn't couldn't redeem her but he redeemed her amen you see it I don't have time to go in every little piece of it but you understand what's happening Ruth is Ruth is resting resting in that promise he said now Ruth rewarded amen we're going home church that's the only thing left there's no more stages we've already been given the promise we've already been we've already been married in a secret ceremony to him and all we're doing we're waiting we're resting Hallelujah until the Final Redemption claim are made and we go home when that last one comes in look he said that's what Ruth is doing now now Ruth rewarded that's where the next the the next thing happens what is the next thing oh my is the reward of the church Hallelujah brother BR said deciding was justification serving making yourself ready sanctification resting was with the Holy Spirit until the wedding supper came oh love what are we doing that's he where a prophet said we were so we can keep doing what we're doing now you say well brother Ben you need to do this you need to do that you need to join this group you need to run after this group you need to run here and and listen to this guy you you need to follow this Prophet or that Prophet I'll tell you what a prophet of God told me if I keep doing what I was doing and rest in the power of the Holy Ghost that I'm going to a wedding supper I'm going to believe that I choose to believe that that if I'll rest in the message of the hour that I'm not out here trying to invent some new doctrine or or come up with something new but I'm resting in the Holy Spirit until the wedding supper comes amen oh that's what I'm looking forward to hallelujah hallelujah amen the church come through John Wesley justif Martin Luther justification through John Wesley sanctification through the Pentecostal baptism of the Holy Spirit and now resting waiting for the coming of her Lord yes amen Lutheran age brother brand said was the springtime and watch how late it is look remember I dropped that in the church for the church Summers ended there's no more hope for the Church of ever being revived the Lutheran age was Springtime wesleying age summer of growth Le AG just Harvest Time was at the end of the summer Gathering the tears for binding and burning garnishing the wheat for the Lord garnering the wheat for the lord it's time for the Harvest to be finished you say well what what's what gets in the way with the landing you know what he's waiting on when the Jewish age was fixed into close now listen closely when the Jewish age is fixing to close Jesus tells his disciples he said something needs to happen look pull up that next scripture put it on there and he said this to his disciples he said the Harvest is plenteous it's harvest time remember that Jewish age he told him don't go to the Gentiles go to the Jews because it was ending that was it it was go it was switching over to the Gentiles the Harvest truly is plenteous but the laborers are few pray ye therefore the lord of the Harvest he'll send forth laborers into his Harvest Right people who are willing while they're resting in the Holy Ghost in their own soul to go out and work for the kingdom of God not because they're made to not because they have to do it to eat but because Boaz is providing amen and they want to share what they've been provided so they go out and so it's the time of the going out you say well this is the age we don't need no more preachers no the Harvest Time was when he said go out into the Harvest all right if there ever was a time for preachers to preach Now's the Time amen pray and brother said he was the lord of the Harvest he told the disciples you ask we have not because we ask not you ask God send forth labors I know some people think well preachers are the problem but we need more of them not less more good ones more that live right more that dedicate themselves to the message labors into his Harvest this age is the last of the seven Church ages this is the latest in church age in in in the church age book what began in the first or Ephesian age must and will come to full fruition and harvest in the last or leoan age the two Vines will yield their final fruit final fruit two spirits will terminate their manifestation in each of their final destination the sewing the watering the growing oh God where are we at church it's all over the only life still still happening the only movement is on the inside of the seed summer is ended the sickle is now thrust into the Harvest Now the ages are actually blending together brother Bram taught that in in the church age book he talks about the overlapping ages he talk he said the Philadelphian age he says lasted till almost the end of the lean age it's a summer right he said it lasted to the end and it just runs out he said overlaps so he said the Philadelphia H is about run its course lat C and H quickly comes in bringing both the tear and the wheat to harvest first buying the tears to burn them but gather the weed into my barn he said remember that the sardian age started the reformation and must still go on until the grain that was planted at Pentecost goes through the full cycle of planting watering nourishing Etc until it comes right back to Original Seed I believe what brother B taught in the church age book is true but this is kind of humorous uh everyone say well where where can you find Lee Vil you know Le Veil must have put something of his own in there it was Etc that's what Lee Vil put in there I don't think that was brother Brandon but he grammar IED it for him I believe it's the truth now look he said while this is going on the tears that were swn will have to go through their cycle and be harvested also they go through that cycle you said that is exactly what we see happening if you can just think of the seasons you can get a very good picture of this the plant that you see growing in full strength in summer suddenly appears to be going to seed you can't tell exactly when summer became Autumn it just faded into it that is how the ages are and especially these last two Gentile ages running out what happened the Gentile ages remember the great I'm I'm throwing a lot in this morning but I hope we can catch pick up parts of it look Daniel 235 he sees the image of gold remember at the head of gold and it and it went all the way down to the feet it was iron and Clay mixed together what was that it represented the Gentile kingdoms are you still awake this morning the Gentile kingdoms what was happening the Gentile ages are almost over how do we know that it's summertime yes because what happens to the Gentile ages that Stone come out of the mountain without hands remember and Crush that's Christ I believe oh Church he's here in his full strength and it said during that time the iron the clay the brass the silver the gold broke into pieces together and became like what like the chaff of the summer threshing floor and the wind carried them away oh my they would purposely oh Church they would purposely exposed the Harvest to the wind so that the wind would blow away everything that was not heavy everything that oh everything that was not in Revival from the latter rain are you with me now everything that didn't did not have get that moisture everything was all blown away everything that the life had left blew away what was left the Original Seed all right Hallelujah no place was found for them and the stone that smoke the image become a great mountain and filled the whole earth during this time the church goes down into tribulation what can the church say today but what Jeremiah said as he saw the the Israelite age those Kingdom age of the two kingdoms ending he says this he said the heart Harvest has passed the summer has ended we're not saved for the church brother brand talked about the preview of the church and how that that church was so awful he said first he saw the bride and then he saw the church and it was so awful he said it was just going down to dancing almost in nudity to rock and roll music remember they were going down but he said is that all I produced that's the Church of America is that all I produced and he said the bride must come again and when the Bride come back the second time brother BR looks at that and he said life get in the grain Oh my he tells them to get back and step it does not mean that the bride is in some cold formal condition just waiting to be rescued but she's been restored back to the original grain just getting that last bit of shaft to be blown away that last bit of carnality that last bit of greenness to be taken out of her look all the life is in her all that he is she is and she bows herself in worship to the king lamb the full word is here how many believe that this morning I I'm closing it just a moment let me say these things brother BR tells us this is my Ministry to declare him that he is here right brother Brand's making an altar call after Discerning the hearts of the people that's an awesome time to make an altar call I always wondered but Joe why everybody wasn't in the altar when brother brandom getss done Discerning the secrets of the hearts and then calling an altar call maybe four or five would come up brother brandom said it was like you shake something before them and they get used to it they just want to see more miracles but then they would come up and he's making an altar call and he said this he said you'll never be any closer till you see him face to face because here all of his characteristics is identified right here now you waiting on something to come get you closer he said you'll never be any closer than where you were right then he said Healing The Sick knowing the secret of the heart he is the word of this hour yes you want to come in contact with him you want to be close to him I heard somebody say the other day and it's true it's not enough just to be in his presence you need to come in contact with him amen you need to press through the crowd till you get in contact with him Hallelujah he is here you said brother Ben where is he in you in me the pillar of fire has become a person brother random talks about that shoe bread on the inside he said it's behind badg your skin and Shak kind of Glory I skipped down a couple sister Joanna sorry if I've been calling you brother Robert I'm sorry I knew he wasn't going to be here this morning CU he had to work in my mind I've been I've been talking to brother Robert and sister Joanna's back there see we're not perfect right but there something on the inside it's got bad your skin on the outside but there's something he said in there is the power in there is the word in there is the shoe bread and the Shina of Glory which is the light makes light that ripens grain Hallelujah you Kansas people know that by your wheat crosss without that sun it won't light and until you come in behind the bad your skin until you get out of your old skin your old thoughts your old Creeds and come into the presence of God and the word becomes a living reality to you and you're awakened to the sh glory and the Bible becomes a new book then Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever you're living in his presence you're living in his where are you in this age you're on the inside of the holy of holies living in his presence eating the shoe bread that's only provided that day for believers priests only we are priests Royal Priests of the holy nation peculiar people giving spiritual sacrifices to God but you must come in to be the veil to see the unveiled God and God is unveiled that's his word made manifest where are we at we are resting in the presence of the son yes brother bam talked about that I don't read the whole quote he said you're going into the grain but lay in the presence of the Sun don't add what I've said don't take away what I've said because I speak the truth as far as I know it as the father's given it to me don't add to it just say what I said the thing of it is just tell the people to come seek the Lord Jesus then you yourselves lay right in his presence just make love to him oh Lord Jesus Son of God I love you tender My Heart Lord take away all the filth and the love
