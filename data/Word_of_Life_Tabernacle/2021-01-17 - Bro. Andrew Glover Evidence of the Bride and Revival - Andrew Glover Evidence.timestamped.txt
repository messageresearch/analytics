[45:08] and amen god bless you this morning the
[45:10] book of revelations here
[45:11] uh the book of revelation the eighth
[45:13] chapter i know uh
[45:14] you hear as message believers this
[45:16] morning so i know you're not unfamiliar
[45:19] with this verse
[45:20] but here in the first verse of the
[45:21] eighth chapter the bible says
[45:23] and when he had opened the seventh seal
[45:26] there was silence in heaven about the
[45:29] space of half an hour
[45:31] when he had opened the seventh seal
[45:34] there was
[45:34] silence in heaven about the space of
[45:37] half an hour now
[45:38] if we could go the book of jeremiah the
[45:39] 32nd chapter
[45:42] jeremiah the 32nd chapter
[45:45] and i've got a few places here i'd like
[45:49] to read this morning if that'd be okay
[45:51] in jeremiah the 32nd chapter and the
[45:54] sixth verse
[45:57] you love the lord this morning are you
[45:59] happy to be a christian
[46:01] amen here in jeremiah 32 and verse 6
[46:05] the bible says and jeremiah said the
[46:07] word of the lord came unto me saying
[46:10] behold hainamel the son of shalom thine
[46:13] uncle shall come
[46:14] unto thee saying by thee my field that
[46:15] is in anoth
[46:17] for the right of redemption is in thine
[46:19] to buy it
[46:20] so hamel my uncle's son came to me in
[46:22] the court of the prison according to the
[46:24] word the lord
[46:25] and said unto me by my field i pray thee
[46:28] that is an anath which is in the country
[46:30] of benjamin
[46:32] for the right of inheritance is thine
[46:35] and the redemption is thine buy it for
[46:38] thyself
[46:39] then i knew it was the word of the lord
[46:41] and i bought the field of hand about my
[46:43] son
[46:43] my uncle's son that was in anoth that
[46:46] weighed him the money even 17
[46:48] shekels of silver and i subscribed the
[46:51] evidence somebody say evidence
[46:53] i subscribed the evidence and sealed it
[46:56] and took witnesses and weighed him in
[46:58] the money
[46:58] in the balances so i took the evidence
[47:01] of the purchase both that which was
[47:02] sealed according to the law and custom
[47:04] that which was open
[47:05] and i gave the evidence of the purchase
[47:07] unto baruch the son of narah
[47:09] the son of manasses in the sight of
[47:11] hainamel my uncle's son
[47:13] and in the presence of the witnesses
[47:15] that subscribed the book of the purchase
[47:17] before all the jews that said in the
[47:19] court of the prison
[47:20] and i charge baruch before them saying
[47:24] thus saith the lord of hosts the god of
[47:26] israel take these
[47:27] evidences this evidence of the purchase
[47:30] both
[47:30] which is sealed and this evidence which
[47:33] is
[47:34] open notice sealed and then open and put
[47:37] them in an earthen vessel
[47:39] that they may continue therein many days
[47:42] for thus saith the lord of hosts the god
[47:44] of israel houses and fields and
[47:45] vineyards
[47:46] shall be possessed again in thy land
[47:50] one other place i'd like to read is
[47:51] revelation 21
[47:53] and verse nine uh revelation 21 verse
[47:56] nine from revelation 8 you hear
[47:58] the seventh seal was open there were
[48:00] silence in heaven about the space of
[48:01] half an hour
[48:02] and you go to jeremiah and you see that
[48:04] there's a time of something being sealed
[48:06] in a time of something being open and
[48:07] there's actually an evidence
[48:09] of it being sealed then there's an
[48:11] evidence of it being open and when you
[48:12] come here to revelation 21 in verse 9
[48:15] the bible says this and there came unto
[48:18] me one of the seven angels
[48:20] now i believe that that was the seventh
[48:21] angel which we believe to be william
[48:23] branham
[48:24] came unto me one of the seven angels
[48:26] which had the seven vowels
[48:28] full of the seven last plagues and
[48:30] talked with me saying
[48:32] come hither and i will show thee the
[48:35] bride
[48:36] the lamb's wife notice there i will show
[48:38] that word sho means to expose to the
[48:40] eyes
[48:41] or to give evidence or a proof of a
[48:43] thing he's saying i will give you
[48:45] evidence i will show thee the bride
[48:48] which is the lamb's wife we ask the lord
[48:51] this morning to add the blessing to the
[48:52] reading of his word
[48:53] as you may have your seats there for
[48:55] just a few moments this morning
[48:57] we thank the lord for the reading of the
[48:59] word of god don't we
[49:01] amen we believe that the word of god is
[49:03] true we believe it's inspired
[49:05] we believe it's infallible and we
[49:06] believe it's the perfect word
[49:08] of the living god this morning and from
[49:10] those scriptures i want to by the help
[49:12] of the lord maybe just to take here a
[49:13] few thoughts it's up on my heart maybe
[49:16] if i would title this morning i want to
[49:17] speak to you on the evidence
[49:19] of the bride's revival the evidence of
[49:22] the bride's revival and we
[49:23] i don't know if maybe some of you saw
[49:25] some of it or not they're on the
[49:26] facebook but we actually they're at home
[49:28] our church brother our pastor there
[49:30] brother sean martin also sends us
[49:32] greetings to you this morning
[49:33] but we had a meeting there last week on
[49:36] the the subject of the seventh seal it
[49:38] was about a seven day meeting and
[49:40] i tell you there for about two or three
[49:42] days or two or three nights of that
[49:43] meeting we were just
[49:44] soared in heavenly places just hearing
[49:46] the things of the seventh hill brother
[49:48] wayne lawson and myself there
[49:49] ministering in that meeting
[49:50] so i've been studying here in this area
[49:52] of the seventh seal
[49:54] and maybe if i could just take a few
[49:55] things this morning and share that with
[49:57] you
[49:57] i believe that the seventh seal is a
[49:59] powerful it's a powerful revelation
[50:01] don't you i believe it's a
[50:02] i believe it's the bride's revival i
[50:04] believe it's the bride's seal
[50:06] and i believe if there's ever been a
[50:07] time for the church of the living god to
[50:09] have a revival
[50:10] i believe the hour has come now for the
[50:12] church to have revival don't you i
[50:14] think if there's ever been a people on
[50:15] the face of the earth that can be in
[50:17] revival
[50:18] i believe the church of the living god
[50:19] which is the bride of jesus christ can
[50:22] be in revival now
[50:23] if i could say this morning before we
[50:24] can have revival there has to be a
[50:26] desire for revival there
[50:28] has to be a thirst for revival i just
[50:30] wonder maybe just by show of hands how
[50:32] many would say lord i desire
[50:34] amen a revival i desire a renewing i
[50:36] desire a refreshing the prophet of god
[50:38] says that is a thirst
[50:40] and he said that you see to neglect the
[50:42] thirst if you neglect to satisfy a
[50:43] thirst of water or food you will die
[50:46] if you neglect that thirst in your god
[50:48] you will spiritually die
[50:49] he said now you call for revivals but
[50:51] you wait for your church to have a
[50:53] revival
[50:54] he said well that ain't the revival for
[50:56] you he said the revival ought to begin
[50:58] right in you when you begin to thirst
[51:00] for god there might not be another
[51:02] member of the church wanting that
[51:04] revival
[51:04] but if it breaks out in you it will
[51:07] break out in other
[51:08] places so amen when you when you begin
[51:10] to feel the first little nudge
[51:12] the first little pull for revival amen
[51:14] don't squash that don't don't don't try
[51:16] to silence that
[51:17] and then there is a reason why there is
[51:19] a desire in your heart for revival
[51:21] amen it's because god is desiring to do
[51:24] something in the church amen now amen i
[51:26] believe there'll never be a revival
[51:28] until the church gets in the spirit of
[51:30] revival the prophet said you get in the
[51:31] spirit of dancing
[51:32] he said you can't have a ball game
[51:34] unless you get in the spirit of the ball
[51:36] game you've got to get in the spirit of
[51:37] it
[51:38] and we can never have a revival in
[51:40] shreveport or anywhere else
[51:42] until the church gets in the spirit of
[51:44] revival god can come
[51:46] and perform miracles he can show wonders
[51:48] he can stretch forth his hand to heal
[51:50] the sick and the afflicted the preacher
[51:52] can preach the gospel
[51:53] as hard as he can but they'll never be a
[51:56] revival
[51:57] until the church gets in the spirit of
[51:59] revival so that tells me
[52:01] amen that the revival is not depending
[52:03] upon the preacher amen the revival
[52:05] is not depending upon the musicians or
[52:08] the song leader or the evangelist
[52:09] amen but the revival is relying upon
[52:12] those who are hungry
[52:14] amen to push beyond traditions and push
[52:16] beyond circumstances
[52:18] amen pushed me on all the things that
[52:20] would try to bind the church
[52:21] amen from having a revival now the word
[52:23] revival means
[52:25] amid an improvement in the condition or
[52:27] the strength of something
[52:28] amen in the religious sense it is a
[52:30] reawakening amen of religious fervor
[52:33] especially by the means
[52:35] amen of a series of evangelistic
[52:37] meetings now
[52:38] i know that denominations has actually
[52:40] changed the idea of what revival is
[52:42] amen pentecostals changed the idea of
[52:45] what revival was
[52:46] amen they thought revival was five or
[52:48] six or eight weeks of meetings and
[52:50] people coming in
[52:51] amen but the prophet come and said no a
[52:53] revival is not the adding of members
[52:55] amen but the revival is the stirring up
[52:58] of the members that you've already got
[53:00] amen to thank you this morning church we
[53:02] don't have to wait
[53:03] amen until a special meeting to have
[53:05] revival we don't have to wait
[53:07] ain't until something until some great
[53:09] convention takes place but i believe
[53:11] right here this morning
[53:12] amen if you're willing to push beyond
[53:14] your own humanity
[53:16] if you're willing to push beyond your
[53:17] own thoughts and your own motives and
[53:19] your own objectives
[53:20] amen i believe we can break into a realm
[53:22] this morning
[53:23] amen that the same spirit of god and
[53:25] then that field the upper room would
[53:27] come in this
[53:28] church this morning and would not just
[53:29] come to excite us
[53:31] amen but it would change its mind and
[53:33] then to think we have seen revivals
[53:35] we've seen true revivals
[53:36] amen and we've seen false revivals now
[53:38] you say what is a false revival
[53:40] well a false revival comes amen by
[53:43] departing from the word
[53:45] while trying to move the people and then
[53:47] they try to move the people but they're
[53:49] trying to move them maybe through the
[53:50] music
[53:51] or moving maybe through some special
[53:53] gift or something amen that is a false
[53:55] revival
[53:56] amen of trying to move the church
[53:58] without the word
[53:59] amen let me say it like this but a true
[54:02] revival
[54:03] amen comes by coming back to the word in
[54:06] order to move the people
[54:07] the prophet said he that hath an ear let
[54:09] him hear what the spirit saith to the
[54:11] churches
[54:12] in every age it was the same cry
[54:15] hear what the spirit says if you are a
[54:18] christian
[54:19] then you will get back to what the
[54:21] spirit is teaching
[54:22] that is the word of this age every
[54:25] messenger to every age
[54:27] will preach that word he says every
[54:29] fresh
[54:30] and true revival will be because men
[54:33] have gotten back to the word for their
[54:35] age he said the cry of every age is the
[54:38] rebuke
[54:39] you have left the word of god repent and
[54:41] come back to the word
[54:43] from the first book in genesis to the
[54:45] last book in revelation
[54:47] one reason amen for god's displeasure
[54:50] was
[54:50] leaving the word amen and there is only
[54:52] one remedy
[54:54] amen to regain his favor is to come back
[54:56] to the word
[54:57] amen see to displease god is to leave
[55:00] his word
[55:01] amen but to please god is to come back
[55:03] to his word
[55:04] amen now we've had all kinds of revivals
[55:06] can amen if you forgot the word and say
[55:08] man
[55:09] amen we've had all kinds of revivals
[55:11] right we've had church revivals
[55:13] we've had denominational revivals we've
[55:15] had man-made revivals we've had
[55:17] intellectual revivals
[55:18] yet to think of all the revivals we've
[55:20] had and then the prophet of god would
[55:22] say but we haven't had a revival yet
[55:25] and many would say we're talking about
[55:26] revival and we ain't had no revival yet
[55:29] we've had a lot of protractive meetings
[55:31] but a revivalist when they tear down the
[55:33] sheds and go to pray and get right with
[55:36] god
[55:36] he says in the third seal that's the
[55:38] reason today that the revivals were
[55:40] supposed to have we had denominational
[55:42] revivals
[55:43] but we haven't had a real story no no
[55:46] no no sir don't think we've got revivals
[55:48] we haven't
[55:49] oh they've got millions and millions and
[55:51] millions of church members
[55:53] amen but not a revival nowhere he said
[55:56] the bride hasn't had a revival yet
[55:59] amen we've had man-made revivals we've
[56:01] had intellectual revivals we've had a
[56:03] million more
[56:04] in 44 we've had youth for christ amen
[56:07] we've had billy graham and oral roberts
[56:08] we've had all these things
[56:10] but in the midst of all that we've not
[56:12] had a revival yet
[56:13] he said there's been no revival amen no
[56:16] manifestation of god
[56:18] he meant to stir the bride see we're
[56:20] looking for it and it will take those
[56:22] seven
[56:22] unknown thunders amen back there to wake
[56:25] her up again
[56:26] he said he will send it he promised it
[56:29] now watch she was
[56:30] dead amen now how many will agree that
[56:32] at one time
[56:33] amen the prophet said the bride was dead
[56:36] they met in traditions and creeds
[56:38] amen she was bound in denominational
[56:40] graves amen they were shouting and they
[56:42] were rejoicing
[56:44] they were hollering they were dancing
[56:45] but there wasn't a revival nowhere
[56:47] he said see they've got the hell of his
[56:49] coming and all they'll pray oh they'll
[56:51] post
[56:52] amen is fast praying fast pray remember
[56:54] brother jack moore and sister moore
[56:56] printed the herald of his coming
[56:57] he said all they'll do is pra as poster
[56:59] print fast pray fast pray
[57:01] god's not done yet send a revival he
[57:03] said see the problem is
[57:05] amen by being a christian amen they feel
[57:08] the pull of the hour
[57:10] amen but they have missed the awakening
[57:12] of the bride
[57:13] they've been seeing the third seal he
[57:15] said there's been no manifestation yet
[57:17] there's been no revival yet there's been
[57:20] no real stirring yet
[57:21] amen but somewhere between 63 and the
[57:24] third seal
[57:25] amen and the feast of trumpets or
[57:27] recognizing your day
[57:28] he could say but today amen she was dead
[57:32] amen but she is awake amen can i take
[57:34] the breaks off and preach here for a
[57:36] minute
[57:36] amen then what woke her up it was when
[57:39] the seventh seal come open
[57:41] and then there was a revival amen that
[57:43] was birthed out of this book
[57:44] amen i'm just going to preach here for a
[57:46] second i don't believe the bride's
[57:48] revival
[57:48] is a bunch of pentecostalism i don't
[57:51] believe the bride's revival is a bunch
[57:52] of emotionalism
[57:54] i believe the bride's revival is the
[57:56] same kind of revival
[57:58] that they had in the days of nehemiah
[58:00] when the word
[58:01] returned to the church when the power of
[58:04] the book come open
[58:05] when the word was released come on
[58:07] church amen when the word is preached
[58:10] there'll be demons cast out when the
[58:12] word is preached
[58:13] amen the sick will be healed when the
[58:15] word is preached
[58:16] even people will be transformed amen
[58:18] from a life of sin
[58:20] into a life of service what do you say
[58:22] in church i'm saying we're not looking
[58:24] for revival this morning
[58:26] we're not trying to fast and pray
[58:28] revival down this morning
[58:29] but the opening of the word has brought
[58:32] a revival in the church
[58:34] of the living god
[58:37] oh somebody shout revival no shout out
[58:40] like you believe it revival
[58:42] amen this week we didn't come for no
[58:43] intellectual talk this morning
[58:45] we come here for revival amen i don't
[58:47] believe the seventh seal was hoping
[58:49] amen to quieten the church down i know
[58:51] there's been a lot of false teachers
[58:53] amen that's mister mistake the seventh
[58:55] seal mistake the seven thunders
[58:57] misrepresented what the prophet meant by
[58:59] the third paul amen but let's come back
[59:02] to the homeland of the bible this
[59:04] morning and let's realize
[59:05] church we are not looking for a revival
[59:08] we have got a revival
[59:10] by the opening of the word see the bride
[59:14] was not awakened and then went back to
[59:16] sleep amen the bride
[59:18] was awakened and she stayed awake
[59:21] she was not awakened by the
[59:23] manifestation of god
[59:24] in those seven thunders and then went
[59:26] back to sleep and then god raised up
[59:28] some man in this last day
[59:30] amen to reawaken her he meant when she
[59:32] was awoke
[59:33] amen she is awoke and that when she woke
[59:36] up
[59:36] she stayed awake amen the prophet said
[59:39] it'll take what
[59:40] it'll take them seven thunders amen to
[59:42] wake up the bride
[59:43] amen i know when you mention seven
[59:44] thunders people get all wadded up
[59:46] amen but let me just remind you before a
[59:48] man mistaught the seven thunders
[59:50] amen william branham taught the truth of
[59:52] the seven thunders and the bible said in
[59:54] revelation 10 3
[59:56] and he cried with a loud voice that's
[59:57] when a lion roared and when he had cried
[1:00:00] seven thunders uttered their voices and
[1:00:02] when the seven thunders had uttered
[1:00:03] their voices
[1:00:04] i was about to write and i heard a voice
[1:00:07] from heaven saying to me
[1:00:08] amen seal up those things amen seal up
[1:00:11] those things
[1:00:12] which were which the seven thunders
[1:00:14] uttered and write them not
[1:00:16] amen see they uttered but john could not
[1:00:18] write them
[1:00:19] and then he had to seal them up and the
[1:00:21] prophet said it was in the end time
[1:00:23] period
[1:00:23] that the seven thunders of jesus amen
[1:00:26] came forth
[1:00:27] amen see it was not in the beginning it
[1:00:29] was not in the middle but it was in the
[1:00:31] end time period
[1:00:32] that the seven thunders of jesus came
[1:00:34] forth he said what was in those thunders
[1:00:36] no one knows
[1:00:37] amen but we need to know amen and he
[1:00:39] says and it will take a profit
[1:00:41] to get the revelation because god has no
[1:00:44] other way of bringing out his scriptural
[1:00:47] revelations
[1:00:48] except by a prophet see revelation does
[1:00:52] not come out
[1:00:52] but by a prophet notice here he said
[1:00:55] with both the theologians
[1:00:57] and the people having departed from the
[1:00:59] word
[1:01:00] god always somebody shout always god
[1:01:02] always sent his servants
[1:01:04] amen to the people but apart from the
[1:01:07] theologians
[1:01:08] in order to correct the false teaching
[1:01:10] and lead the people back to god
[1:01:13] he said now this messenger of malachi 4
[1:01:16] and revelation 10 is going to do two
[1:01:19] things
[1:01:19] amen one according to malachi 4 he will
[1:01:22] turn
[1:01:23] the hearts of the children amen to the
[1:01:25] fathers
[1:01:26] now here's the second thing he will
[1:01:28] reveal
[1:01:29] amen the mysteries of the seven thunders
[1:01:32] in revelation
[1:01:33] 10 which are somebody say with me which
[1:01:36] are the revelations contained in the
[1:01:39] seven seals
[1:01:40] amen so now brother david it's not me
[1:01:42] telling you it's not brother ben telling
[1:01:45] you
[1:01:45] or some other preacher telling you what
[1:01:47] the seven thunders are we now have a
[1:01:49] vindicated prophet
[1:01:51] on the earth declaring that the seven
[1:01:53] thunders
[1:01:54] are contained in the revelation
[1:01:57] of those seven seals it'll be these
[1:02:00] divinely revealed
[1:02:01] mystery truths that will literally amen
[1:02:04] i love that word
[1:02:06] that will literally even turn the hearts
[1:02:09] of the children to the pentecostal
[1:02:11] fathers
[1:02:12] amen brother what it's going to do is
[1:02:14] it's going to come down in the church
[1:02:16] and it's going to move the church amen
[1:02:18] come on church
[1:02:19] this seventh seal it's not some mystery
[1:02:21] this seventh seal is not some education
[1:02:24] this seventh seal is not some some
[1:02:26] scriptural learning
[1:02:27] this seventh seal amen is christ himself
[1:02:30] coming back in the church
[1:02:32] and taking possession of the hearts and
[1:02:34] lives of the people
[1:02:35] and literally somebody shout literally
[1:02:38] amen
[1:02:39] literally turning the hearts of the
[1:02:41] children back
[1:02:42] to the faith of the bible oh
[1:02:45] to think this morning the opening of
[1:02:47] that seventh seal
[1:02:48] will produce amend the bride's revival
[1:02:51] amen you say then what is the bride's
[1:02:53] revival
[1:02:54] the bride's revival is a word revival
[1:02:58] the bride's revival is a word revival
[1:03:02] see the prophet says education can never
[1:03:04] bring life
[1:03:06] it takes the spirit of god to bring life
[1:03:10] and the life must not come out of just
[1:03:12] the intellectual revival broken sisters
[1:03:14] it's got to come out of the bible he
[1:03:16] says word revival
[1:03:18] and that word is the same yesterday
[1:03:21] today and forever and when it falls
[1:03:24] today
[1:03:25] and quickens you get the same results
[1:03:28] that you did in acts chapter 2 exactly
[1:03:31] it always has
[1:03:32] and it always will be because it's the
[1:03:34] spirit of god
[1:03:36] that conditions the atmosphere it takes
[1:03:38] atmosphere to do things
[1:03:40] amen now can i just take a little
[1:03:41] liberty here and preach amen without an
[1:03:43] atmosphere i mean this is just a
[1:03:45] building
[1:03:46] without an atmosphere this is just a
[1:03:48] pulpit without an atmosphere
[1:03:50] this is just another platform amen but
[1:03:52] if an atmosphere comes in here
[1:03:54] amen if an atmosphere amen i know a lot
[1:03:57] of people's got a lot of different
[1:03:58] opinions but guess what i got the
[1:03:59] microphone this morning
[1:04:00] amen i'll tell you what the prophet of
[1:04:02] god said he said it takes an atmosphere
[1:04:04] a meant to bring a birth it takes an
[1:04:06] atmosphere amen to bring a change
[1:04:09] let me say this we have gotten so oh god
[1:04:12] amen we all didn't know i wasn't no bank
[1:04:14] no pennywise preacher amen i'm gonna
[1:04:16] preach here for a second
[1:04:17] amen we've gotten so cold and so
[1:04:19] indifferent
[1:04:20] and so intellectual that we can't even
[1:04:22] say amen no more
[1:04:24] we can't even shout no more we can't
[1:04:26] raise our hands no more
[1:04:27] we just come and sit and look at the
[1:04:29] preacher and say move me if you can
[1:04:31] amen if you find something good i might
[1:04:33] have i might happen to have it amen
[1:04:35] amen but that's not the bride amen
[1:04:38] that's not the word
[1:04:39] amen the word says let everything that
[1:04:41] hath breath praise ye the lord
[1:04:43] i think this morning church i think it's
[1:04:45] time we let the devil know
[1:04:47] there's still some holy ghost alive in
[1:04:49] word of life tabernacle
[1:04:50] there's still some hallelujahs there's
[1:04:52] still some amens
[1:04:54] there's still some thank you jesus
[1:04:55] there's still some worshipers
[1:04:57] come on church you realize an atmosphere
[1:04:59] is not made
[1:05:00] an atmosphere is created you don't make
[1:05:03] an atmosphere
[1:05:04] you create an atmosphere you don't build
[1:05:06] an atmosphere
[1:05:07] you create it you say that how can i
[1:05:09] create it because the prophet said
[1:05:11] you are a secondary god he said you are
[1:05:15] an amateur creator you've got to write
[1:05:17] this morning
[1:05:20] come on church you've got the right this
[1:05:22] morning amen to create an atmosphere in
[1:05:25] this church

[1:05:30] back in the church you say how do i do
[1:05:32] it amen when you push past
[1:05:34] what is pushing against you when you
[1:05:36] push back against the spirit that's
[1:05:38] trying to hold you
[1:05:39] when you push back beyond the formalism
[1:05:41] hey and you realize
[1:05:43] if i just create an atmosphere something
[1:05:45] good
[1:05:46] is about to happen and then look at
[1:05:48] somebody and say something
[1:05:50] good is about to happen when believers
[1:05:52] get together
[1:05:53] i'll tell you what happens demons are
[1:05:55] defeated when believers get together
[1:05:58] revelation comes and changes lives and
[1:06:01] without this seventh seal
[1:06:03] we are a hopeless church we are a
[1:06:05] confused people
[1:06:06] we are a powerless preacher but with the
[1:06:08] opening of the word
[1:06:09] all power in heaven and earth is with
[1:06:12] this message
[1:06:13] if somebody will believe it amen god
[1:06:16] will come down
[1:06:18] [Applause]
[1:06:20] it takes an atmosphere it takes an
[1:06:22] atmosphere
[1:06:23] and then to see a change it takes an
[1:06:25] atmosphere
[1:06:26] to see a breakthrough can i preach to
[1:06:29] you for a second
[1:06:30] you know what some of us need this
[1:06:31] morning is a breakthrough
[1:06:33] you know what we need this morning is a
[1:06:35] breakthrough you know how you're going
[1:06:36] to get it
[1:06:37] you ain't going to get it sitting there
[1:06:38] sleeping and you ain't going to get it
[1:06:40] sitting there texting
[1:06:41] and you ain't going to get it sitting
[1:06:42] there saying how long i'm preaching but
[1:06:44] when you begin to peck
[1:06:45] against the shell that you're in when
[1:06:47] you begin to peep
[1:06:48] oh come on church amen how many say this
[1:06:51] morning i want to break through
[1:06:52] amen i want to break through i'm tired
[1:06:54] of this coming to church
[1:06:55] i'm tired of just paying my tithes i'm
[1:06:58] tired of just singing the songs
[1:06:59] god this morning i want to break through
[1:07:02] i want to break through this barrier
[1:07:03] i want to break through this wall i want
[1:07:05] to break through this coldness
[1:07:07] i want to break through this formalism i
[1:07:09] want to break through this lukewarm
[1:07:10] condition
[1:07:11] that's trying to steal my victory trying
[1:07:13] to steal my joy
[1:07:14] you say is it possible brother harvey
[1:07:17] all things are possible
[1:07:18] to them that'll believe this morning i
[1:07:20] believe there's some eagles here
[1:07:22] but you got to peck your way through
[1:07:26] oh ain't nothing wrong with me i just
[1:07:28] got victory
[1:07:29] ain't nothing wrong with me i just
[1:07:30] believe the word is open ain't nothing
[1:07:32] wrong with me i believe the seventh seal
[1:07:34] is more than a history lesson i believe
[1:07:37] it is a word
[1:07:38] revival and let me say it like this
[1:07:40] there is a drastic difference
[1:07:42] between a word revival and a
[1:07:44] denominational revival
[1:07:45] amen there is a drastic difference the
[1:07:47] prophet said this this after effects
[1:07:49] of the revival he says the after effects
[1:07:51] of the meeting
[1:07:52] when he preached on the holy ghost he
[1:07:54] said are these questions
[1:07:56] now think about that amen the prophet
[1:07:58] preached a three-part series
[1:07:59] on what is the holy ghost what is the
[1:08:01] holy ghost given for
[1:08:02] and then he comes with quests and
[1:08:04] answers on the holy ghost out of that
[1:08:06] word revival
[1:08:07] he says the evidence of the after
[1:08:09] effects of this meeting
[1:08:10] will be the questions that come from
[1:08:12] what's being taught
[1:08:13] now do you realize those were not
[1:08:15] questions that was leading to unbelief
[1:08:17] but they were questions that was broad
[1:08:20] in the understanding
[1:08:21] of the subject that was at hand i say
[1:08:23] this morning church
[1:08:24] it's a sad day when the effect of the
[1:08:26] word and the effect of the revelation
[1:08:28] has been crucified around our churches
[1:08:31] it's a sad day
[1:08:32] when the effect of the holy ghost has
[1:08:34] been squashed down
[1:08:35] by some cold spirit it's a sad day when
[1:08:38] the power of the holy ghost
[1:08:40] has been reduced to shaking a preacher's
[1:08:42] hand and claiming you believe god sent a
[1:08:44] prophet
[1:08:44] there is a power in this message church
[1:08:46] there is a reality in this message
[1:08:48] there is a place you can go where the
[1:08:50] holy ghost can light your fire and let
[1:08:53] me just say this
[1:08:54] if this message don't light your fire i
[1:08:56] think your wood's wet
[1:08:59] if this message don't set your soul on
[1:09:01] fire
[1:09:02] something's wrong somewhere well
[1:09:04] preacher what are you talking about
[1:09:06] the prophet god said we have got the
[1:09:08] revelation
[1:09:09] amen now can i preach this morning amen
[1:09:11] i'm going to take my time and preach all
[1:09:13] right

[1:09:15] okay amen we have got
[1:09:17] for revelation see you've got every
[1:09:19] right to sit there

[1:09:22] looking for the revelation
[1:09:24] you've got everyone to sit there without
[1:09:26] a sound in your heart
[1:09:27] without an amen upon your lips if you're
[1:09:29] looking for the revelation
[1:09:30] rather being if you're hoping the
[1:09:32] revelation comes but a prophet said

[1:12:51] morning and the prophet said
[1:12:52] and so has this abraham group amen so
[1:12:56] has this group that has seen the effects
[1:12:59] of the revelation of jesus christ
[1:13:02] we have seen the effect of it we have
[1:13:04] felt the pull of it
[1:13:05] we have seen the charge of it and the
[1:13:07] prophet said that's the way you've done
[1:13:08] the church
[1:13:09] we've made it pretty and we've decorated
[1:13:11] it with denominational tinsel but it
[1:13:12] ain't got no life in it
[1:13:14] it can't produce that bible evidence
[1:13:16] again see
[1:13:17] now who are these promises made to these
[1:13:19] promises are
[1:13:20] made not to the church nominal not to
[1:13:23] the hybrid church
[1:13:25] not to the national church not to the
[1:13:27] government church
[1:13:28] these promises are not made to those
[1:13:30] these promises are made
[1:13:32] to the elected now do you realize the
[1:13:36] prophet said this when jesus come on the
[1:13:38] scene
[1:13:38] he promised us a land he said in my
[1:13:41] father's house of many mansions
[1:13:42] and there's life beyond death and he
[1:13:44] crossed jordan what we call jordan death
[1:13:47] he crossed over into the other land
[1:13:50] and brought back the evidence he crossed
[1:13:53] over
[1:13:54] into the other land and brought back the
[1:13:56] evidence
[1:13:57] on the third day he rose again he eat he
[1:14:00] drank
[1:14:01] and he said feel me i'm not a spirit i'm
[1:14:04] flesh and bones and he said i'm going to
[1:14:06] give you an earnest to this
[1:14:07] but wait up there for 10 days they got
[1:14:10] perseverant after that too
[1:14:11] because they had the power the evidence
[1:14:14] of the resurrection in them
[1:14:16] that's the reason they loved not their
[1:14:17] lives unto death because they could be
[1:14:19] perseverant
[1:14:20] they had evidence see what did evidence
[1:14:22] do
[1:14:23] evidence moved them into action
[1:14:26] evidence moved them into perseverance
[1:14:29] evidence moved them into faith see the
[1:14:32] problem of god said and you have the
[1:14:33] earnest
[1:14:34] the first payment on the eternal
[1:14:36] resurrection
[1:14:37] now what is evidence evidence is the
[1:14:40] available body of facts
[1:14:42] or information indicating whether a
[1:14:45] belief or
[1:14:45] proposition is true or valid
[1:14:50] see you can have a belief you can have a
[1:14:52] proposition
[1:14:53] but without evidence it's just a belief
[1:14:56] without
[1:14:56] evidence it's just a proposition but
[1:14:59] when there comes
[1:15:00] evidence it'll change it from being a
[1:15:03] proposition
[1:15:04] from just being a belief to being a
[1:15:06] living reality
[1:15:08] now how many will agree with me amen
[1:15:10] that moses actually sent
[1:15:11] spies to search out the land if you look
[1:15:14] at numbers 13
[1:15:15] and verse 1 the bible said the lord
[1:15:16] spake unto moses saying
[1:15:18] send thou men that they may search the
[1:15:20] land of canaan
[1:15:22] which i give unto the children of israel
[1:15:23] every tribe of their fathers
[1:15:25] shall send a man everyone a ruler among
[1:15:28] them now notice here
[1:15:29] moses sent them up by the way of the
[1:15:30] clan of canaan and said them get you up
[1:15:32] the way southward and go up in the
[1:15:34] mountain
[1:15:34] and you see the land what is it and the
[1:15:36] people that dwell therein whether they
[1:15:37] be stronger weak fewer many
[1:15:39] notice here he actually says go in there
[1:15:42] and search out the land
[1:15:45] and when you get in there see if they be
[1:15:47] few or many
[1:15:48] now here's what i love about it they
[1:15:50] meant there were many giants in the
[1:15:52] land but what does it matter if they're
[1:15:54] weak
[1:15:56] if there's many there what difference
[1:15:58] does it make if they're weak enemies
[1:16:00] notice here in verse 23 and they came
[1:16:03] unto the brook of escal
[1:16:04] and cut down from fence a branch with
[1:16:07] one cluster of grapes
[1:16:08] and they buried between two upon a staff
[1:16:10] and they brought out the pomegranates
[1:16:12] and of the figs notice here and the
[1:16:14] place was called the brook escal
[1:16:16] because of the cluster of grapes which
[1:16:18] the two of israel cut down from thence
[1:16:20] and they returned from search land 40
[1:16:23] days now can i read you something the
[1:16:24] prophet of god said
[1:16:27] lord jesus confirmation how we thank
[1:16:29] thee
[1:16:30] for the presence of the divine one
[1:16:32] tonight if the people could only realize
[1:16:34] their authority in him
[1:16:36] oh how great it would be lord if they
[1:16:38] can only believe it and have faith
[1:16:40] may they to not take a hold of that
[1:16:42] faith they've been taught it
[1:16:43] they've been preached it's been preached
[1:16:45] them and they have read it out of the
[1:16:47] bible
[1:16:48] they have seen others who appropriated o
[1:16:50] great god jehovah the mighty one who was
[1:16:52] made flesh and blood among us
[1:16:53] now somebody shout now now you're
[1:16:57] made flesh in our flesh by the holy
[1:17:00] spirit here tonight
[1:17:02] quickening the word and clicking the
[1:17:04] promises that you have spoken
[1:17:05] notice here what did caleb do caleb sent
[1:17:08] spies
[1:17:08] or rather moses sent spies and land and
[1:17:11] caleb
[1:17:11] come back or they come back with the
[1:17:13] evidence of the land
[1:17:17] and i preached this morning they came
[1:17:19] back from the land with evidence
[1:17:21] that you know what i like brother harvey
[1:17:23] is they went over there and they got a
[1:17:24] cluster of grapes
[1:17:26] they went over there and got a cluster
[1:17:27] of the grapes and they came back and the
[1:17:30] bible says the grapes were so big
[1:17:33] now do you ever go to the grocery store
[1:17:34] and buy some grapes do you go in there
[1:17:36] and ask somebody to help you carry the
[1:17:38] grapes out to your car
[1:17:39] you don't do it you know why because
[1:17:41] them grapes ain't that big
[1:17:43] them grapes ain't that heavy them grapes
[1:17:45] ain't that great
[1:17:46] amen but these grapes were so big and
[1:17:49] these grapes were so strong
[1:17:51] that they said we've got to have help
[1:17:55] we've got to have help he meant to carry
[1:17:58] this evidence
[1:17:58] amen i could preach there for a while
[1:18:00] couldn't i taken sides with jesus
[1:18:02] oh how i would love to take some of
[1:18:03] these young men and send him an
[1:18:05] evangelist
[1:18:06] amen to help with this message amen to
[1:18:09] help care
[1:18:09] come on church to help carry the
[1:18:11] evidence what is this message
[1:18:13] this message is the evidence that there
[1:18:16] is a land beyond the river
[1:18:18] this message is the evidence to every
[1:18:21] song about heaven
[1:18:22] this message is the evidence to every
[1:18:25] song about victory
[1:18:26] this message is the evidence to every
[1:18:29] song about joy
[1:18:32] when you go over there caleb come back
[1:18:34] and he begin to feed
[1:18:36] upon the evidence of the land you know
[1:18:38] what it does he began to eat on them
[1:18:40] grapes
[1:18:40] he began to eat on them grapes you know
[1:18:42] what happened the product of god said
[1:18:44] caleb
[1:18:44] got so inspired they've been
[1:18:46] paraphrasing he got so inspired
[1:18:49] by eating on those grapes you know what
[1:18:50] them grapes did them grapes begin to
[1:18:53] release
[1:18:55] them grapes begin to release amen begin
[1:18:58] to release an anointing
[1:19:00] begin to release something in him that
[1:19:02] he said you know what
[1:19:03] we are well able to take this land
[1:19:07] you realize a few this was an 80 year
[1:19:08] old man but he began to eat
[1:19:11] on the evidence of the land and the
[1:19:14] evidence
[1:19:14] began to fill him up and the prophet
[1:19:16] said don't mind me
[1:19:18] for perspiring and slobbering i'm just
[1:19:20] eating the evidence
[1:19:25] i'm just seeing the evidence of the land
[1:19:27] beyond the river
[1:19:28] are you hearing me he said see the
[1:19:30] evidence and then caleb
[1:19:32] was the type of the true believer joshua
[1:19:35] was the top of the leader
[1:19:39] i'm trying amen help me somebody amen
[1:19:42] the evidence of the land
[1:19:43] amen was there the evidence was real and
[1:19:46] god sent josh away who would be a leader
[1:19:49] ain't meant to lead him in that land
[1:19:51] amen brother ben he would lead them amen
[1:19:53] beyond their inabilities
[1:19:55] come on church brother josiah do you
[1:19:56] realize caleb was 80 years old
[1:19:58] amen but when he began to eat on the
[1:20:00] land it began to release an anointing in
[1:20:02] him
[1:20:03] it began to release a fire in him what
[1:20:05] are you saying i'm not preaching this
[1:20:06] morning for my health
[1:20:08] i'm not up here just to have a pulpit
[1:20:10] i'm trying to get you
[1:20:11] amen to push me on your fear please be
[1:20:14] on your doubt
[1:20:15] i'm telling you church there's evidence
[1:20:17] here this morning
[1:20:18] there's evidence here this message is
[1:20:20] real if you'll just start
[1:20:22] eating on the evidence of it it'll
[1:20:24] release a fire in you
[1:20:26] it'll put an amen in your heart
[1:20:30] do you realize caleb was an old man with
[1:20:33] stooped shoulders
[1:20:34] with gray hair with a wrinkled face with
[1:20:37] no abilities of his own
[1:20:38] but when he ate the evidence
[1:20:42] when he ate the evidence it put a fire
[1:20:44] in him
[1:20:45] he said you know what if these grapes
[1:20:47] are so good i don't just want an
[1:20:48] appetizer i want the seven
[1:20:50] course meal i want the seven course meal
[1:20:54] i want every bit of it
[1:20:58] the evidence now what is the evidence
[1:21:01] you say the evidence is not natural
[1:21:02] grapes today you're right
[1:21:03] the evidence is the holy ghost
[1:21:08] well you see jesus didn't promise us a
[1:21:12] land
[1:21:14] caleb and joshua was promised the land
[1:21:17] we are promised the land
[1:21:20] not a land the land the prophet said the
[1:21:24] pilgrim fathers
[1:21:25] were very thankful for their newfound
[1:21:27] way of life being separated
[1:21:29] from the old english denominations and
[1:21:31] creeds
[1:21:32] he said could be married to the new
[1:21:35] anointed word
[1:21:36] for their age
[1:21:39] separated us and opened to us
[1:21:42] a new land a new message for this day
[1:21:50] separated us from the old land
[1:21:55] us from the old traditions and opened
[1:22:00] opened notice it didn't say in
[1:22:02] revelation 8 1
[1:22:04] and when the seventh seal was sealed
[1:22:06] there was silence in heaven
[1:22:07] about the space of an hour no it said
[1:22:09] when the seventh seal
[1:22:11] was opened now you'll agree with me this
[1:22:14] morning
[1:22:15] amen that the message of the hour is the
[1:22:16] opening of the book
[1:22:18] it's the opening of the word it's the
[1:22:21] revealing
[1:22:21] of the son of man it's the manifestation
[1:22:24] of the third pool
[1:22:26] it's the power amen of god to bring a
[1:22:28] church
[1:22:29] into adoption it's the reality of the
[1:22:32] theophany
[1:22:32] it's the pull from another dimension
[1:22:35] come on church
[1:22:36] this message should not be looked at
[1:22:38] casually
[1:22:39] this message should not be treated
[1:22:41] that's just another idea
[1:22:43] this message should be the headship of
[1:22:46] every preacher
[1:22:47] it should be the headship of every
[1:22:49] pulpit this
[1:22:50] message is the opening of the new land
[1:22:56] now our country a nation has recently
[1:22:59] been changed forever
[1:23:03] over one word
[1:23:08] election
[1:23:11] this country will never be the same
[1:23:15] over one word election
[1:23:20] you say what are you talking about the
[1:23:22] devil
[1:23:23] is trying to get our eyes off of our
[1:23:26] election
[1:23:28] on to the election of this world now you
[1:23:30] realize
[1:23:31] our president claims that this last
[1:23:32] election was rigged
[1:23:35] that's a claim now
[1:23:38] let's just let's well we're here we
[1:23:39] might as well preach it we we're this
[1:23:41] far into it let's go and deal with it
[1:23:43] it's a claim but you know what it's only
[1:23:45] a claim if there's no evidence
[1:23:49] but when you've got evidence then you've
[1:23:52] got more than just a claim
[1:23:53] now you've got people that's got to be
[1:23:55] under obligation to look at the evidence
[1:23:57] see now they can't just dismiss the
[1:23:59] claim there's evidence
[1:24:00] but we live in a nation where you can
[1:24:02] have hundreds of thousands of evidence
[1:24:04] and affidavits and they won't even look
[1:24:06] at it
[1:24:08] no i'm not preaching politics but i'll
[1:24:10] just throw that in there for free amen
[1:24:11] our world has changed forever
[1:24:13] but you know what as much as i hate to
[1:24:16] see what's going on there
[1:24:17] i have to realize that the devil is
[1:24:20] trying to get our eyes off of our own
[1:24:21] election
[1:24:22] the bible says in first thessalonians 1
[1:24:24] 4 knowing brethren
[1:24:26] beloved your election of god in second
[1:24:28] peter 1 10 wherefore the rather brethren
[1:24:31] give diligence
[1:24:32] to make your call and an election sure
[1:24:34] for if you do these things
[1:24:36] ye shall never fall look at what this
[1:24:39] word call it means
[1:24:40] it means to a feast
[1:24:43] the divine invitation the word election
[1:24:46] means the act of picking out
[1:24:47] amen used the fact or the act of god's
[1:24:50] free will
[1:24:51] by which before the foundation of the
[1:24:53] world
[1:24:54] he decreed his blessings to certain
[1:24:57] persons
[1:24:58] notice here and then that word fall
[1:25:00] means to stumble or fall in misery
[1:25:03] do you realize that the point of god
[1:25:04] said the devil can make you think you're
[1:25:06] called when you're not
[1:25:08] and he can make you think you're not
[1:25:09] called when you are
[1:25:15] he can make you think you are called
[1:25:17] when you're not
[1:25:18] and he can make you think you're not
[1:25:20] called when in reality brother joe you
[1:25:22] are
[1:25:23] when in reality there is a call upon
[1:25:26] your heart
[1:25:27] now notice here a preacher with a
[1:25:29] ministry
[1:25:30] is commissioned by god right but he must
[1:25:33] be called
[1:25:34] and he must be elected amen now do you
[1:25:36] realize the bride of jesus christ
[1:25:38] must be amen commissioned by god to be
[1:25:41] the bride
[1:25:42] she must be called by god and she must
[1:25:44] be elected by god
[1:25:46] to be the bride now let me say this the
[1:25:48] opening of the seventh seal
[1:25:50] was the calling out of the bride and the
[1:25:53] bringing
[1:25:54] of the commission to the earth to find a
[1:25:57] bride
[1:25:58] and to be the bride see the seventh seal
[1:26:01] commission was not just find the bride
[1:26:04] it was when you find that bride
[1:26:05] then preach a power that will equip her
[1:26:08] to be the bride
[1:26:10] what good does it do brother caleb amen
[1:26:12] to preacher the bride
[1:26:13] to preachers of bride to preachers and
[1:26:16] bride if we don't preach
[1:26:17] something that'll put a backbone in the
[1:26:19] church not to just claim they're the
[1:26:21] bride but to be the bride
[1:26:23] to manifest the bride to manifest the
[1:26:26] promises
[1:26:26] that was written concerning the bride
[1:26:29] now in genesis 24
[1:26:30] you realize eliezer was commissioned to
[1:26:32] find the bride for isaac
[1:26:34] and the power of god used this term he
[1:26:36] says ministers
[1:26:37] hunt my bride amen notice here hunt my
[1:26:40] bride now in 1963
[1:26:42] amen is this okay in 1963
[1:26:46] we hear the term the calling out of the
[1:26:48] bride
[1:26:50] today is the calling out of the bride
[1:26:53] out of the church
[1:26:54] the exodus for the rapture feast the
[1:26:56] trumpets the long period of pentecost
[1:26:58] which ends in the calling out of the
[1:27:00] bride the bride is called out by a
[1:27:02] servant
[1:27:03] get it preacher c don't miss it question
[1:27:06] answer 64.
[1:27:07] then come the time of the calling out of
[1:27:10] the bride
[1:27:10] which was to escape
[1:27:14] all the damnation notice here in works
[1:27:17] is faith expressed
[1:27:18] and those men maybe some of them present
[1:27:20] here here in the tape around the world
[1:27:22] may they realize that this is the
[1:27:25] calling
[1:27:26] out of the bride this is not brother
[1:27:29] howard this
[1:27:30] is not a pentecostal message this
[1:27:33] is not a pentecostal restore the gift
[1:27:36] he said that was the pentecostal age but
[1:27:39] this is the calling forth
[1:27:41] of the bride another message that was to
[1:27:44] come
[1:27:45] just before sodom was to be born to be
[1:27:48] burned
[1:27:48] he said let them understand then see the
[1:27:51] difference in this message
[1:27:53] amen the pentecostal message brought a
[1:27:55] restoration of the gifts
[1:27:56] but the seventh angel's message brought
[1:27:59] an understanding
[1:28:00] of the giver
[1:28:03] glory to god amen the pentecostal
[1:28:06] message
[1:28:06] brought a restoration of the guests but
[1:28:09] the seventh angel's message
[1:28:11] will bring an understanding that we
[1:28:13] don't just have the gifts
[1:28:15] but we've got the giver
[1:28:18] brother ben we don't just have the gifts
[1:28:20] this morning
[1:28:21] we have the giver now why brother andrew
[1:28:25] why is the bride called out she is
[1:28:28] called out
[1:28:29] for the ministry of christ to be
[1:28:32] manifested
[1:28:33] in the ministry of the bride see this is
[1:28:36] more
[1:28:36] than just a ministry of a prophet this
[1:28:38] is more than just the ministry of a
[1:28:40] preacher of the pastor
[1:28:44] of an evangelist this is the hour for
[1:28:46] the ministry of the bride
[1:28:48] can i preach this morning it has to be
[1:28:51] because a woman
[1:28:52] and her husband become one they become
[1:28:55] one
[1:28:55] and so does the bride and christ become
[1:28:58] one
[1:28:59] the ministry of the bride and the
[1:29:02] ministry of christ
[1:29:03] is the same it's not two separate
[1:29:06] ministries
[1:29:07] it's the same so then when god gives a
[1:29:09] commission
[1:29:10] he will give a confirmation of the
[1:29:12] commission let me say this
[1:29:14] the bride's commission is not a natural
[1:29:16] commission
[1:29:17] the bride's commission is not a church
[1:29:20] commission
[1:29:20] the bride's commission is a supernatural
[1:29:23] commission
[1:29:24] that came from a supernatural god who
[1:29:26] gave the supernatural power
[1:29:28] for a supernatural deliverance
[1:29:31] somebody shout deliverance somebody
[1:29:34] shout deliverance
[1:29:36] a natural deliverance
[1:29:39] see this morning i believe it god is not
[1:29:42] going to deliver his people by education
[1:29:46] then the seventh seal is not a learning
[1:29:52] god is not going to deliver his people
[1:29:54] by theology
[1:29:56] then the message of the hour is not
[1:29:58] theology
[1:29:59] he's not going to deliver them by
[1:30:01] science then the message of the hour
[1:30:03] is not science
[1:30:08] are you hearing me why would god send a
[1:30:12] supernatural message
[1:30:13] then let a bunch of preachers define
[1:30:16] what that message is
[1:30:17] if god sends a message he defines what
[1:30:20] kind of message he's sending
[1:30:22] if god sends a commission he don't need
[1:30:24] a preacher
[1:30:25] to define what kind of commission it is
[1:30:27] he defines it himself
[1:30:29] and this is not a natural commission
[1:30:32] this
[1:30:32] is not a natural calling this is a
[1:30:35] supernatural commission
[1:30:39] well he said with andre i don't think
[1:30:41] that i don't think we need all this
[1:30:42] pentecostal hard and carrying all that i
[1:30:44] tell you what
[1:30:45] i just i just with brother ben and
[1:30:46] brother then brothers up there quit
[1:30:48] shouting hard and carrying on i was
[1:30:49] brother being quit trying to preach so
[1:30:50] amen won't you join him this is not a
[1:30:54] theology
[1:30:55] come on church you sleep in school i've
[1:30:58] done it
[1:31:00] education's boring come on well
[1:31:04] i just killed the meeting right turned
[1:31:05] five minutes didn't i hey hey
[1:31:08] at least get a kid to say amen now
[1:31:10] education's boring
[1:31:11] amen i mean i remember being a kid
[1:31:13] sitting in school looking out the
[1:31:14] windows i'd see a turkey out in the
[1:31:16] field
[1:31:16] and a squirrel out in a tree i think my
[1:31:18] god that's what boys was born to do is
[1:31:20] go out there and kill them thanks not
[1:31:21] sit here listen to this algebra we'll
[1:31:22] never use
[1:31:24] right amen but you know what amen
[1:31:26] there's no reason
[1:31:27] amen you don't shout in school you don't
[1:31:29] holler even when the teacher says we're
[1:31:31] gonna learn two plus two
[1:31:32] you didn't get up and dance did you you
[1:31:34] know why cause it's an education
[1:31:36] there's no anointing behind it there's
[1:31:38] no power behind it
[1:31:39] amen but when a teacher said you passed
[1:31:41] the test you can go home
[1:31:43] amen that wasn't education that was a
[1:31:45] reality
[1:31:46] and you know what this prophet was
[1:31:47] saying he was saying you're the bride
[1:31:50] you've been commissioned to be the bride
[1:31:51] you're the chosen and oriented of god
[1:31:53] you know what i'm not teaching this
[1:31:55] morning i'm declaring to you church you
[1:31:58] have been released
[1:31:59] by the opening of the word amen to
[1:32:01] possess the land
[1:32:02] to take the inheritance
[1:32:06] this ain't an education this ain't a
[1:32:08] theology
[1:32:09] this ain't a learning this is a reality
[1:32:14] oh since the prophet you say what are
[1:32:16] you saying i'm saying he didn't send an
[1:32:18] education
[1:32:19] he sent a power
[1:32:22] he didn't send the learning he sent an
[1:32:24] anointing
[1:32:30] he didn't send a suggestion
[1:32:33] he sent a commission
[1:32:38] can i give you one more he didn't see in
[1:32:41] the definition
[1:32:43] right he sent a vindication
[1:32:48] you say what are you talking about a
[1:32:50] definition can be anybody's things
[1:32:54] come on well let's break it down there's
[1:32:58] a chair
[1:32:59] right you know what i say i say a chair
[1:33:04] you can sit in it brother ben comes
[1:33:08] along and says
[1:33:09] a chair is a place you can rest
[1:33:13] brother joe comes along and says a chair
[1:33:16] is a bottom and a top
[1:33:17] and you can sit there and you can you
[1:33:19] you can sleep in it
[1:33:21] see we got one item now with three
[1:33:24] different definitions
[1:33:26] but when a voice of vindication speaks
[1:33:29] there's nothing can be added there's
[1:33:31] nothing can be
[1:33:32] changed there's nothing to be taken away
[1:33:34] when the voice of vindication speaks
[1:33:37] it's the absolute it's the final
[1:33:42] now i'm just going to take the breaks
[1:33:43] off and preach here for a second because
[1:33:45] since the prophet preached
[1:33:46] the revelation of the seven seals how
[1:33:49] many believes he preached that
[1:33:50] how many believes he finished out his
[1:33:52] earthly ministry
[1:33:54] do you realize since that time there has
[1:33:56] been what we call
[1:33:58] the case of the seventh seal
[1:34:01] come on come on the case of the seventh
[1:34:04] seal you say what is it
[1:34:06] this is it is it open or is it closed
[1:34:11] can i take some liberty here is it open
[1:34:13] or is it closed
[1:34:15] is it revealed or is it still going to
[1:34:17] be revealed is it sealed or is it still
[1:34:19] going to be unsealed
[1:34:20] well let me just say this what is the
[1:34:22] case a case
[1:34:23] is an incident or set of circumstances
[1:34:26] under police investigation it is a set
[1:34:29] of facts
[1:34:30] or arguments supporting one side in a
[1:34:34] legal action
[1:34:39] now the prophet of god i'm so down here
[1:34:42] because i want you to get this
[1:34:43] the prophet of god preached a message
[1:34:44] called a trial
[1:34:46] he preached a message called a court
[1:34:48] trial
[1:34:50] you know what he preached that message
[1:34:51] several times you know what he says
[1:34:53] i want to have this little trial first
[1:34:55] and now the case today
[1:34:57] in the court trial the case is the word
[1:34:59] of god's promise
[1:35:01] versus the world now a case cannot be
[1:35:04] called
[1:35:05] unless it's for some cause
[1:35:08] a case cannot be called unless it's for
[1:35:11] some cause
[1:35:12] now watch here you realize it's amazing
[1:35:14] now this is amazing to me
[1:35:16] because we're living a day and time now
[1:35:18] brother josiah we've got preachers
[1:35:20] who have left this message that are now
[1:35:22] putting this message on trial
[1:35:26] well let's preach we might as well but
[1:35:29] brother harvey literally got the nerve
[1:35:31] to put this message on trial you know a
[1:35:33] guy the other day he sent me that
[1:35:34] he sent me a part there she said watch
[1:35:36] this he said the message is on trial
[1:35:38] i just laughed to myself you know why
[1:35:40] because 56 years ago
[1:35:43] the messenger who was bringing the
[1:35:45] message put his own message on trial
[1:35:48] in front of several different
[1:35:49] congregations and every time
[1:35:52] the judge of all judges the supreme
[1:35:54] ruler
[1:35:55] the supreme king came down in the
[1:35:58] building
[1:35:58] and picked up the gavel and hit the desk
[1:36:01] and said the verdict is
[1:36:03] in the message is the truth
[1:36:07] listen church the case is closed this
[1:36:09] morning
[1:36:10] this message is not up for debate this
[1:36:13] message
[1:36:14] is not up for interpretation this
[1:36:17] message
[1:36:17] is not up for man's ideas the case is
[1:36:20] closed this morning
[1:36:21] this message is the truth then what is
[1:36:24] it looking for
[1:36:25] it's looking for somebody who will
[1:36:27] believe it and let it become
[1:36:29] the preeminence of their life
[1:36:31] [Music]
[1:36:34] now a case begins with a claim don't it
[1:36:40] come on the david acclaim is made
[1:36:46] a claim help me lord
[1:36:49] acclaim means to state or assert
[1:36:53] that something is the case
[1:36:57] typically without providing evidence or
[1:37:00] proof
[1:37:02] so you can make a claim but without
[1:37:04] evidence it's just a claim
[1:37:06] see jesus said destroy this temple and
[1:37:09] in three days i'll raise it up again
[1:37:10] you realize what jesus just did he made
[1:37:13] the claim of all claims
[1:37:17] he made the claim of all claims destroy
[1:37:20] this temple and in three days i'll raise
[1:37:24] it up again
[1:37:24] do you realize there was confucius there
[1:37:27] was buddha
[1:37:28] there was muhammad there was all kinds
[1:37:30] of great men
[1:37:32] who were making claims the same way
[1:37:34] jesus did
[1:37:35] but you realize there was just claims
[1:37:38] because the prophet said here this
[1:37:40] morning
[1:37:40] we have sure solid rock foundation
[1:37:46] of the evidence of the resurrection
[1:37:49] now let me say this education cannot
[1:37:52] produce evidence of the edge of the
[1:37:53] resurrection
[1:37:54] it takes faith to see the direct
[1:37:56] evidence
[1:37:57] of the resurrection of christ so what is
[1:38:00] a claim
[1:38:00] a claim is just a claim without
[1:38:03] confirmation evidence
[1:38:04] the strength of a claim is evidence
[1:38:09] the strength of a claim is evidence
[1:38:14] let's say that together the strength of
[1:38:16] a claim
[1:38:17] is evidence see the bible says abraham
[1:38:20] made a claim that he
[1:38:23] and sarah would have a child you realize
[1:38:26] abraham claimed
[1:38:28] that by an unseen evidence there would
[1:38:31] be
[1:38:32] a visible manifestation
[1:38:39] help me jesus that would be like brother
[1:38:42] joel
[1:38:43] me going outside and looking and seeing
[1:38:47] a brand new a brand new 1500 pickup out
[1:38:49] there
[1:38:50] we'll call it a chevrolet right because
[1:38:51] that's that's that's a good truck right
[1:38:53] amen there's a brand new 1500 silverado
[1:38:56] truck out here
[1:38:57] and you know what i say brother joel
[1:38:58] it's got your name on it
[1:39:00] you and you and your wife are gonna
[1:39:01] drive at home today you know what i went
[1:39:04] out there
[1:39:04] i saw the evidence of it you know what i
[1:39:06] did i opened the door and i got the
[1:39:08] title out of it
[1:39:09] and i put it in my pocket and i come
[1:39:11] back in here and i said church
[1:39:13] there's a brand new truck out there
[1:39:15] brother joe and his wife is going to
[1:39:16] drive at home
[1:39:17] you know what i did i went out there
[1:39:20] nobody else in here saw it
[1:39:22] but i saw it see no one else god
[1:39:26] no one else out there saw the truck but
[1:39:28] i
[1:39:29] laid my eyes on it and i came in here
[1:39:31] and i preached a promise to you
[1:39:33] that you're gonna drive that truck home
[1:39:35] and you know what about halfway through
[1:39:37] reality struck you and you jumped up and
[1:39:40] threw your old car keys in the air
[1:39:42] whatever they are and you said praise
[1:39:44] god i'm gonna leave this whole car
[1:39:46] behind
[1:39:47] i'm gonna get me a brand new truck amen
[1:39:49] somebody come over and say brother joel
[1:39:51] you're crazy man you ain't seen that
[1:39:53] truck it don't matter
[1:39:55] i heard the promise
[1:39:58] brother joel you can't shout like that
[1:40:01] you've never seen the title
[1:40:02] it don't matter i've done heard the
[1:40:04] promise listen
[1:40:05] amen i went in the unseen and saw the
[1:40:08] evidence
[1:40:09] and brought back a report do you realize
[1:40:12] i could read it to you
[1:40:13] amen but i don't want to put you to
[1:40:14] sleep by reading to you amen let me say
[1:40:16] it to you like this
[1:40:17] the prophet of god said reproach for the
[1:40:18] cause of his word he said abraham
[1:40:21] went into another dimension and saw the
[1:40:24] evidence
[1:40:28] oh god josiah he went in the other room
[1:40:31] and saw sarah hold the baby her milk
[1:40:35] ranger still dried up
[1:40:36] his body was still as good as dead no
[1:40:38] life in him
[1:40:40] 75 and 65 years old but he went into a
[1:40:43] realm
[1:40:45] [Music]
[1:40:48] he went into a real brother david and
[1:40:50] saw
[1:40:51] sarah holding the baby and he come back
[1:40:54] in this realm
[1:40:55] and the evidence stacked up against him
[1:40:57] greater
[1:40:58] and greater and greater and greater but
[1:41:01] it never
[1:41:02] changed
[1:41:05] [Music]
[1:41:09] it never changed his claim
[1:41:14] he claimed they were going to have a
[1:41:17] child
[1:41:19] he claimed sarah was going to hold a
[1:41:21] baby
[1:41:23] he claimed that sarah was going to nurse
[1:41:25] her own child
[1:41:28] come on he went there
[1:41:32] yeah come on come on he saw it
[1:41:36] come on
[1:41:41] now the problem of god said man always
[1:41:43] requires a confirmation
[1:41:46] or some sort of evidence
[1:41:49] [Music]
[1:41:50] do you realize the rest of town didn't
[1:41:52] see what abraham saw
[1:41:54] but that did not change the fact
[1:41:57] that abraham saw it
[1:42:03] brother ben the rest of the community
[1:42:05] didn't see it
[1:42:07] but it never changed abraham's testimony
[1:42:10] because he was there he saw it
[1:42:14] he saw sarah he saw the baby
[1:42:17] do you realize the product of god said
[1:42:18] this he said if you've got the title of
[1:42:20] a car
[1:42:21] it's the evidence of the car though you
[1:42:23] haven't even seen the car
[1:42:24] or the car be in the garage if you just
[1:42:27] get the evidence
[1:42:28] if you just get the promise if you just
[1:42:31] get the word
[1:42:32] he said you can have a deed to a piece
[1:42:34] of ground it's yours
[1:42:35] though you've never seen the ground
[1:42:37] though you don't even have it in your
[1:42:38] possession
[1:42:39] but you have the evidence of it
[1:42:47] abraham made a claim
[1:42:50] i'm still the bride's revival so stay
[1:42:52] with me abraham made a claim
[1:42:56] without one visible evidence
[1:43:02] now the prophet said a hundred years old
[1:43:05] the evidence got greater and greater and
[1:43:08] greater and piled up against him
[1:43:10] but he was looking at the unseen now let
[1:43:12] me say this
[1:43:13] i would like to present a case here this
[1:43:15] morning of the claim
[1:43:17] that we've heard for years
[1:43:20] we've heard it claimed for years that
[1:43:22] the seventh seal
[1:43:23] is open we've heard a claim for years
[1:43:27] now something i i i ain't gonna fight
[1:43:29] with you so don't don't go there i ain't
[1:43:30] fighting okay
[1:43:31] amen there's some that say this heaven
[1:43:32] seal is closed and the bottom line to me
[1:43:34] is when you see it open you can't even
[1:43:35] see the fact that it's open
[1:43:38] but i'd like to say this we've heard
[1:43:40] these claims from the message of the
[1:43:41] hour
[1:43:42] that remember what is a claim it's a set
[1:43:44] of facts but there's got to be evidence
[1:43:46] to put a backbone to those facts here
[1:43:48] are some of the claims we've heard
[1:43:50] we've heard that the bride is in
[1:43:52] possession
[1:43:53] of the seventh seal revelation we have
[1:43:55] heard we ain't looking for revival
[1:43:57] we found it we have heard that the
[1:44:00] revelation of god
[1:44:01] has been brought to us by the hand of
[1:44:04] vindication
[1:44:05] we have heard that the time is at hand
[1:44:07] to unseal
[1:44:08] what has been sealed we have heard that
[1:44:11] the seventh seal
[1:44:12] is an absolute secret until the seventh
[1:44:14] angel begins to sound
[1:44:16] we have heard everybody would die unless
[1:44:18] a prophet would come with the word
[1:44:20] and understand what was sealed we have
[1:44:22] heard we are not looking for the answer
[1:44:24] we have the answer we have heard the
[1:44:26] seventh seal
[1:44:27] it's not a learning it is a life we have
[1:44:30] heard the mysteries of this message
[1:44:32] will have a voice we have heard the
[1:44:34] seventh seal is christ coming in the
[1:44:36] church
[1:44:36] we have heard the seventh seal is the
[1:44:39] coming of the lord
[1:44:40] we have heard that the rapture is not
[1:44:42] just coming the rapture is happening
[1:44:44] we have heard the third pull is here we
[1:44:46] have heard brother david
[1:44:48] that the shout of first thessalonians 4
[1:44:51] is a message
[1:44:52] of malachi 4 amen together a bride for
[1:44:55] christ
[1:44:55] we have heard what is the attraction on
[1:44:58] the mountain
[1:44:58] what was prophecy is now history we have
[1:45:01] heard
[1:45:02] that the seventh seal brings christ back
[1:45:05] to earth again
[1:45:06] you say brethren that's a bunch of
[1:45:07] claims you're exactly right

[1:46:22] is not a bunch of fussing and fighting
[1:46:26] what are you talking about i'll tell you
[1:46:28] like this brother dave can i share
[1:46:29] something with you
[1:46:30] i remember one time i was out preaching
[1:46:32] one time brother ben and i got preached
[1:46:33] a message on the open book
[1:46:40] brother harvey i study one day and heard
[1:46:42] a proud of god say this
[1:46:44] he said we now have the answer i think i
[1:46:46] might even preach that message here at
[1:46:47] this church
[1:46:48] on the open book he said we now have the
[1:46:51] answer
[1:46:51] and when i heard that i went to the
[1:46:53] place he said and we'll pass the test
[1:46:56] you realize the book's got to come open
[1:46:58] if it's an open book test
[1:46:59] the book's got to come open to get the
[1:47:01] answer out of the book
[1:47:03] if the book remains closed then there's
[1:47:05] no answer
[1:47:08] but when the book comes open it opens up
[1:47:11] the answer
[1:47:12] and what is the answer the answer is
[1:47:15] christ
[1:47:17] see the answer is christ now i said the
[1:47:19] church that's preaching with me
[1:47:20] on that open book they opened the word
[1:47:22] the power of god
[1:47:23] at your church your brother called me in
[1:47:25] the office the pastor he said well
[1:47:27] he said i want to have a talk with you i
[1:47:28] said okay
[1:47:31] what's new i said what
[1:47:35] and what i thought to myself you know
[1:47:36] what's new he said well brother andrew
[1:47:38] he said you've got to realize you ain't
[1:47:40] got no right to preach that seventh seal
[1:47:42] as an evangelist and you ain't got no
[1:47:43] right to preach that third pull
[1:47:45] and you ain't got no right to preach
[1:47:46] revelation 5 revelation 10
[1:47:48] you ain't got he said you you young
[1:47:50] whippersnapper you probably ain't even
[1:47:51] read half of those quotes
[1:47:53] i said brother i've read your quotes he
[1:47:55] said well
[1:47:56] he said let me sit like this he said you
[1:47:58] have no right
[1:47:59] to declare and claim the seventh seal is
[1:48:01] open i said okay
[1:48:02] and you have no right to tell me that
[1:48:04] it's not open when i'm the evidence it
[1:48:06] is open
[1:48:10] come on sir amen just because it's close
[1:48:13] to you
[1:48:14] don't mean it's close to everybody
[1:48:17] just because it's confusing to you don't
[1:48:19] mean the rest of us
[1:48:20] are confused just because you let some
[1:48:23] man add interpretation and definition
[1:48:26] to what a prophet said doesn't mean the
[1:48:28] rest of us did
[1:48:30] come on church i'm going to close right
[1:48:31] here but there's some victory
[1:48:33] in the seventh seal there's some joy in
[1:48:36] the seventh seal
[1:48:37] there's some power in the seventh seal
[1:48:39] that's the 19th
[1:48:40] and the seventh seal this is not an
[1:48:42] education this is not a bunch of fussing
[1:48:45] and fighting
[1:48:45] and putting clothes together and who's
[1:48:47] right who's wrong this is the evidence
[1:48:50] that the son of man has revealed himself
[1:48:53] and there
[1:48:54] is a bride that's in a real
[1:48:57] true word revival
[1:49:01] [Music]
[1:49:02] brother me and i ain't looking for
[1:49:03] revival i'm in revival
[1:49:07] oh brother josiah ever since the day i
[1:49:09] heard a prophet say
[1:49:11] in what time is it search he said now is
[1:49:13] this that third pool
[1:49:14] are these them seven thunders is this
[1:49:17] which will bring the power of god
[1:49:19] back in the church again you know what
[1:49:21] he's done brother joe he give me a
[1:49:22] license
[1:49:23] to preach this message he said now you
[1:49:26] draw your conclusion
[1:49:29] you draw your conclusion and you know
[1:49:32] what i did brother harvey
[1:49:33] i went to the word and i drew my
[1:49:35] conclusion based on the word
[1:49:37] you know what the prophet said if the
[1:49:39] book is closed then there's no
[1:49:40] understanding
[1:49:41] but i'm not preaching to a bunch of
[1:49:43] confused people this morning
[1:49:46] if the book is closed there's no
[1:49:48] understanding there's no direction
[1:49:50] there's no vision but thank god this
[1:49:52] morning church
[1:49:53] that the book has come open in this
[1:49:55] generation
[1:49:56] we have seen his word we have seen his
[1:49:58] power we have seen his anointing
[1:50:00] we have seen his reality
[1:50:06] oh brother
[1:50:10] just cause you ain't in revival don't
[1:50:12] mean the rest of us ain't
[1:50:15] just cause you ain't got joy don't mean
[1:50:16] the rest of us ain't and you know what
[1:50:18] brother howard i've come to place
[1:50:20] i'm done apologizing for being who i am
[1:50:25] brother i've done i'm done apologizing
[1:50:28] for being who i am
[1:50:29] i believe this message i believe it's
[1:50:31] the evidence of the rapture
[1:50:33] i believe it's the evidence of the
[1:50:34] resurrection i believe william branham
[1:50:37] was a prophet
[1:50:38] i believe there was a first pool i
[1:50:40] believe there was a second pool
[1:50:41] but i believe there is a third pool and
[1:50:43] i believe there's a bride this morning
[1:50:45] that is walking in the footsteps of a
[1:50:47] prophet and she's walking
[1:50:49] with power and authority to bind the
[1:50:52] serpents
[1:50:52] whatever you bind on earth shall be
[1:50:55] bound in heaven
[1:50:56] whatever you loose on earth shall be
[1:50:58] loosed in heaven
[1:50:59] come on church do you see what this
[1:51:01] message did
[1:51:02] do you see what this seventh seal did it
[1:51:04] brought the power of god back in the
[1:51:07] church
[1:51:07] [Music]
[1:51:10] and when you see it brother ben
[1:51:15] come on when you see it
[1:51:18] you can't unsee it when you hear it
[1:51:22] you cannot hear it
[1:51:25] are you hearing me when you come in
[1:51:28] contact with it
[1:51:30] it changes
[1:51:33] on thank you lord it don't matter if the
[1:51:36] whole church is asleep
[1:51:38] if you hear your name you're going to
[1:51:39] stand up and say amen
[1:51:42] it don't matter if everybody around you
[1:51:44] is uninterested when you hear that word
[1:51:46] you're going to raise your hand and say
[1:51:47] that's for me
[1:51:49] see if something in you calls for
[1:51:51] revival that doesn't mean it's a church
[1:51:53] revival
[1:51:54] it's an individual revival to bring a
[1:51:56] revival to your heart
[1:52:02] are we in it brother ben do we see it
[1:52:07] are we in the bride's revival
[1:52:10] brother told me today he said well he
[1:52:12] said praise god
[1:52:15] brother mark it kind of kind of kind of
[1:52:17] made me a little comical
[1:52:19] guy that they told me said well praise
[1:52:20] the lord he said when mine and harris
[1:52:22] gets in
[1:52:23] he said the church will get on fire
[1:52:27] i said brother i was on fire when obama
[1:52:29] was in
[1:52:34] come on well berlander brother ben it
[1:52:37] was honest god's truth the woman told me
[1:52:38] back when hillary and trump was running
[1:52:40] she said oh if hillary gets in it'll put
[1:52:42] the church in action
[1:52:44] i said sister where you been the church
[1:52:46] has been in action
[1:52:47] it's ever since ever since revelation 10
[1:52:50] 7 begin to sin
[1:52:52] come on come on sir brother bride
[1:52:54] survival is going to come with andrew
[1:52:55] when persecution comes
[1:52:57] relevant said persecution he said
[1:52:59] natural persecution
[1:53:01] put israel in the homeland natural power
[1:53:04] put the church in the world council
[1:53:06] churches but the power of god
[1:53:08] will put the people in the bride
[1:53:22] what are you saying i'm saying just as
[1:53:25] jeremiah
[1:53:27] bought that property sealed the evidence
[1:53:33] in earthen vessels
[1:53:44] with a message that would open up those
[1:53:47] seven last
[1:53:48] seals of the bible
[1:53:52] that would restore the oneness of the
[1:53:53] godhead
[1:53:55] that would restore the truth on
[1:53:56] predestination
[1:53:58] that would restore the authority to the
[1:54:01] church
[1:54:02] that would have straightened out the
[1:54:03] evidence of the holy ghost
[1:54:06] that would be the very power to change
[1:54:09] our bodies
[1:54:13] he sent a message to open it
[1:54:16] a prophet to open it
[1:54:22] but those that evidence is not infused
[1:54:24] this morning
[1:54:26] that's right looks like y'all got rid of
[1:54:28] them pews

[1:54:33] an abuse and you got rid of your
[1:54:34] evidence of revival

[1:54:48] wooden benches and got padded cushions
[1:54:51] i said what's that got to do with it he
[1:54:53] said well kick the power of god out of
[1:54:54] the church
[1:54:58] i said well brother if your power only
[1:55:00] goes as far as it wouldn't be you need
[1:55:01] to find more than a wooden bench you
[1:55:02] need to find a wooden altar

[2:01:38] ever since i got drunk on the evidence
[2:01:40] of this message
[2:01:43] it set a fire in my soul that i want
[2:01:46] every individual i preached to
[2:01:49] to be drunk on the fervor of this
[2:01:52] message
[2:01:53] to be drunk on the inspiration
[2:01:56] that it's poured out to be drunk
[2:02:00] on the transforming power of the words
[2:02:03] of a prophet of god
[2:02:06] you love him this morning oh my
[2:02:10] victory this morning to the blood of
[2:02:12] jesus christ
[2:02:14] with the evidence of his resurrection

[2:02:23] you can't unsee it when you hear it
[2:02:28] you can't un hear it
[2:02:32] see brother hardy that's the problem
[2:02:35] there's some preachers around this
[2:02:36] message
[2:02:37] that seen the opening of the word
[2:02:40] they've seen the son of man revealed
[2:02:43] they've seen the lamb take the book
[2:02:45] they've seen the prophet say maybe i'm
[2:02:47] just feeling this way and this is just a
[2:02:49] sublime act
[2:02:50] but let me call the lamb to come and
[2:02:52] claim his bride
[2:02:53] thank the lord they've seen the evidence
[2:02:56] of what a drop of bleach will do to a
[2:02:58] life of an individual
[2:03:01] and they can't unsee it they can't unsee
[2:03:04] it
[2:03:05] they may go through a lot of trials
[2:03:08] and there may be a lot of hard times but
[2:03:10] when they come out of it
[2:03:11] they've still seen the evidence of the
[2:03:13] land
[2:03:14] oh god this is coming hot off the press
[2:03:17] so you're just going to get it as it's
[2:03:18] coming okay
[2:03:19] come on what you've been through
[2:03:23] it's not enough to take the evidence out
[2:03:25] of your heart
[2:03:28] that this message is still the truth
[2:03:37] i'm getting ready put another door in
[2:03:38] this church where do you want it
[2:03:40] come everything you've been through
[2:03:44] it's not enough to destroy
[2:03:49] the evidence that god opened up through
[2:03:51] a prophet and sealed
[2:03:53] in your earth and vessels
[2:03:56] you'll come out on the other side as a
[2:04:00] witness
[2:04:04] i just feel to share this if it's okay a
[2:04:06] few years ago
[2:04:08] well probably last year year before last
[2:04:09] sometime we was out
[2:04:11] at byc at the youth camp there and we

[2:05:11] pastor to pennsylvania we come up here
[2:05:13] and salt
[2:05:14] the niagara falls and he said i remember
[2:05:16] how to get there he said that was seven
[2:05:17] or eight years ago he said but

[2:05:23] he said this is different that's
[2:05:24] different you know but but the amazing
[2:05:26] thing about it was
[2:05:27] a lot of things had changed around it
[2:05:29] but the main attraction of what was
[2:05:30] drawing people
[2:05:31] to that area was still the same
[2:05:36] the niagara falls was why people was
[2:05:39] coming to that part of canada

[2:05:42] lot
[2:05:44] they weren't coming to see the the signs
[2:05:46] they were coming to see
[2:05:47] the attraction
[2:05:51] and let me say this there's been a lot
[2:05:53] change around this message
[2:05:56] and if god terry's just coming 20 more
[2:05:57] years there'll be a lot more
[2:05:59] change but let me just tell you this the
[2:06:01] attraction will never

[2:10:17] cox's church
[2:10:18] and charlie cox gave this brother the
[2:10:20] table that brother branham brought them
