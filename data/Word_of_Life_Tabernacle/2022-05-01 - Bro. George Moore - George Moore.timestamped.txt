[39:43] i beseech you i therefore the prisoner
[39:47] i therefore the prisoner of the lord
[39:48] beseech you that ye walk worthy
[39:51] of the vocation wherewith ye are called
[39:54] with all loneliness and meekness with
[39:57] long suffering forbearing one another in
[40:01] love everybody say love
[40:03] endeavoring to keep the unity of the
[40:04] spirit in the bond of peace there is one
[40:07] body and one spirit even as ye are
[40:10] called in one hope of your calling
[40:13] one lord one faith one baptism
[40:16] one god and father of all who is above
[40:19] all and through all and in you
[40:22] all
[40:24] but unto every one of us has given grace
[40:26] according to the measure of the gift of
[40:28] christ wherewith he saith when he
[40:30] ascended up on high he led captivity
[40:33] captive and gave gifts unto men
[40:36] now that he ascended what is it but he
[40:40] also descended first into the lower
[40:42] parts of the earth he these he that
[40:45] descended is the same also that ascended
[40:48] up far above all heavens that he might
[40:51] feel
[40:52] all things yes
[40:55] and he gave some apostles and some
[40:57] prophets and some evangelists and some
[41:00] pastors and teachers
[41:02] for the perfecting of the saints for the
[41:05] work of the ministry for the edifying of
[41:09] the body of christ
[41:12] till we all come in the unity of faith
[41:16] and the knowledge of the son of god unto
[41:19] a perfect man
[41:21] unto the measure of the stature of the
[41:24] fullness of christ amen
[41:28] and galatians the first chapter the
[41:30] sixth verse will read i marvel
[41:33] that ye are so soon removed from him
[41:38] that calls you into the grace of christ
[41:42] unto another gospel so paul speaking
[41:45] here saying that he was
[41:48] in shock
[41:50] at how quickly
[41:52] the people had moved from the gospel
[41:54] that he had gave them
[41:57] is that right
[41:58] and to another gospel which is not
[42:00] another but there be some that trouble
[42:03] you
[42:04] and went per and would pervert
[42:06] the gospel of christ
[42:08] there be some that trouble you and would
[42:11] pervert the gospel of christ but though
[42:14] we
[42:15] or an angel from heaven preach any other
[42:19] gospel than that which we have preached
[42:23] unto you
[42:24] let him be a curse
[42:28] as we said before
[42:30] so say i now again if any man preach
[42:34] any other gospel unto you
[42:37] then that which ye have received let him
[42:40] be accursed
[42:42] and one more little verse of scripture
[42:44] in the book of revelations the 19th
[42:46] chapter
[42:50] revelations 19
[42:57] and seven
[43:00] revelations 19 7 let us be glad
[43:04] and rejoice
[43:06] and give honor to him
[43:09] for the marriage of the lamb has come
[43:12] and his wife has made herself
[43:16] ready
[43:18] and to her was granted that she should
[43:20] be arrayed in fine linen
[43:23] clean and white
[43:25] for the fine linen
[43:27] is the
[43:29] righteousness
[43:30] of
[43:31] saints yes let's just bow our heads
[43:34] heavenly father we thank you lord for
[43:36] the reading of your precious word
[43:39] this evening lord
[43:41] lord god heavens and earth will pass
[43:43] away but this word will not pass away
[43:46] and every time we open the pages of this
[43:49] book it says the same thing every time
[43:52] lord
[43:52] lord it never changes
[43:54] and lord god we just thank you for that
[43:56] we thank you for solid
[43:58] ground to stand on
[44:00] this afternoon
[44:02] and i pray lord that you would bless
[44:03] this service bless these brothers and
[44:06] sisters of light precious faith lord i
[44:09] pray you to just speak to us this
[44:11] evening lord i ask you to watch over me
[44:14] bind my lips before i speak anything
[44:16] unpleasing to you and we'll commit it
[44:18] into your hands now in the name of our
[44:20] lord jesus christ amen and amen god
[44:23] bless you you may be seated and i would
[44:26] like to take a subject this afternoon of
[44:28] how does god lead his church
[44:32] how
[44:33] does god
[44:35] lead his church can you say amen
[44:38] and i'll just call your attention to
[44:40] this that in the book of revelations
[44:42] you'll find that the bride of jesus
[44:44] christ had something to do yes the bride
[44:48] had made herself ready now brother brown
[44:51] said he can't push you in a pipe and
[44:52] pull you out the other end and say
[44:54] blessed is he that overcometh but rather
[44:56] the bride has something to do the bride
[45:00] has made herself ready and the bride was
[45:02] also or she was also clothed
[45:06] in fine linen and so there's a lot of
[45:09] different opinions on what the fine
[45:11] linen is but the bible said that the
[45:13] fine linen was the righteousness of the
[45:16] saints and brother branham said the same
[45:20] and if you look in the message and see
[45:21] what he's talking about he always says
[45:23] it was the righteousness of the saints
[45:25] and in other places he said it was the
[45:27] holy spirit
[45:29] that the bride was clothed
[45:32] in the holy spirit and brothers and
[45:34] sisters if you have the holy spirit in
[45:37] your life it will lead you into
[45:39] righteousness is that right
[45:42] and so we find then that the bride was
[45:44] clothed in righteousness we also know
[45:47] that brother branham taught that the
[45:49] message this message that we hold dear
[45:52] this message that we believe tonight
[45:55] cannot be denominated is that what
[45:57] brother brown said you cannot denominate
[46:00] the message of the hour now he now
[46:02] here's the here's the problem with this
[46:04] brothers and sisters men are building
[46:06] denominations and around this message
[46:10] but the pure word cannot be denominated
[46:14] you cannot organize the pure word of god
[46:16] now there's plenty of organizations
[46:18] being built around the message but the
[46:21] pure word cannot be denominated
[46:25] can i preach tonight
[46:26] now the word of god cannot be
[46:29] denominated now you can take parts of
[46:31] the word and build the denomination out
[46:33] of it
[46:35] you can take parts of the message
[46:37] and build an organization out of it but
[46:39] the pure word to take it all cannot be
[46:42] denominated
[46:44] is that what he's saying
[46:46] amen
[46:48] so we find then that you cannot organize
[46:50] this word and god only has one program
[46:54] and i'm hearing a lot about what god's
[46:56] program is here lately like everybody's
[46:58] telling me what god's program is every
[47:01] everybody's got a program that god has
[47:03] and i just keep hearing that word it's
[47:05] god's program it's god's program brother
[47:07] ben it's god's program but i only find
[47:09] one program in the bible and that's the
[47:12] one i just read to you out of ephesians
[47:14] 4.
[47:15] so i don't know where all the other
[47:16] programs come from but i'll tell you
[47:18] where they don't come from
[47:21] amen
[47:23] and so people are always telling me what
[47:25] god's program is but but i think it's
[47:27] god's job tell us what the program is
[47:29] amen and and he's established well
[47:33] that that uh that we have a program
[47:37] amen
[47:38] and i don't want to discount any of
[47:40] god's program right yeah amen
[47:43] come on i i want all of it i want
[47:45] everything that the lord has for yes
[47:47] amen i don't want to discount any of it
[47:49] so i i but i question this brothers we
[47:52] know that that god sent in the church
[47:54] apostles prophets preachers teachers and
[47:56] evangelists he set them in the church
[47:58] is that right
[48:00] now he did not in anywhere that i can
[48:02] find in ephesians 4 set general
[48:04] presbyters or general overseers or
[48:06] bishops or anything like that
[48:09] amen as far as i can see by the word
[48:11] each local assembly is sovereign yes
[48:14] is that right
[48:16] amen and it's not to be ruled over by
[48:18] any other man or any other group of men
[48:20] or any other organization
[48:23] amen
[48:25] is that the word as you understand yes
[48:27] and so we find then that god appoints a
[48:30] local pastor yes is that right god does
[48:33] amen appoints a local pastor and a local
[48:37] pastor answers to god alone yes that's
[48:40] right amen that's right
[48:43] and that is
[48:45] the
[48:46] program yeah that's right now this
[48:49] program is too simple for someone
[48:53] yeah and you know you hear all the time
[48:55] people say well
[48:56] we we we don't need that no more because
[48:59] we've got the message of the hour
[49:06] we've got the message of the hour now
[49:08] look brothers and sisters i'm just silly
[49:10] enough
[49:11] to preach that if brother braham said it
[49:13] i believe it
[49:15] amen so so everybody so if i want to so
[49:17] if i want to say that i have the message
[49:19] of the hour don't i need to believe what
[49:21] the messenger says yes sir
[49:23] amen
[49:26] so you say well i just want to hear the
[49:27] message no i don't want to just hear the
[49:29] message i want to believe what the
[49:31] messenger said
[49:33] amen
[49:34] and so we find then that paul
[49:36] established brother ben this ministry in
[49:39] ephesians 4
[49:41] and paul it was it said not once but
[49:44] twice if anybody says anything contrary
[49:47] to this
[49:49] let them be a curse
[49:52] he said if i say
[49:53] anything contrary if an angel from
[49:56] heaven says anything contrary
[49:58] if anybody that says anything contrary
[50:01] than what i've established already let
[50:03] them be a curse
[50:04] now brother brent read to you this
[50:06] morning where brother brown went beyond
[50:07] the curtain of time and when he was
[50:10] beyond the current time he was looking
[50:11] at all those people
[50:13] and all of those people said uh said my
[50:16] precious brother and he said are all
[50:18] these branhams
[50:21] amen
[50:23] they said no these are your converts to
[50:25] christ he said will paul's people be
[50:27] there
[50:28] will peters be there
[50:32] is that what brother being read this
[50:34] morning
[50:35] yeah will they be there
[50:38] he said well then i preached the same
[50:41] message that paul preached
[50:43] amen
[50:44] so whatever paul said brother branham
[50:46] said yeah
[50:47] amen and so he preached the same and so
[50:50] anything contrary to the gospel that
[50:52] paul preached and then by extension the
[50:54] gospel that brother branham preached
[50:57] anything contrary let it be a curse
[51:01] is this message
[51:03] and so we find then that we are
[51:07] resting on that yes sir
[51:11] we're resting on it
[51:15] and brother branham says in his army
[51:18] he presents his army in the form of five
[51:21] offices
[51:23] apostles prophets teachers pastors
[51:26] evangelists that's his army
[51:30] that's his soldiers
[51:32] that's his commanding officers
[51:37] now here's the important part after
[51:39] with the all with the baptism of the
[51:43] holy ghost
[51:45] now look saints
[51:46] i'll be the first to tell you there's
[51:47] been many
[51:48] preachers that's made a lot of messes
[51:51] yeah oh yeah sure
[51:55] there's been a whole lot of people that
[51:56] made a whole lot of messes listening to
[51:57] tapes too yeah
[51:58] sure what's what's good for one's good
[52:00] for the other yeah i mean we're just
[52:02] gonna point out everybody doing wrong
[52:04] we'll be here a while amen
[52:06] amen
[52:08] we'll be here a while so it's important
[52:11] that the ministry be led by the holy
[52:13] ghost
[52:15] by the holy ghost
[52:17] and that's the part everybody missing
[52:18] everybody knows the quotes and they know
[52:20] what brother branham said but we don't
[52:21] have the holy ghost that are alive to
[52:24] lead us and guide us in these things yes
[52:26] sir amen
[52:28] he said when he the spirit of truth has
[52:31] come yes
[52:32] that's not a man yeah yes that's the
[52:35] spirit of christ yes
[52:37] he will lead you
[52:41] amen amen
[52:43] it's the holy spirit that has to lead
[52:44] the church it's the holy spirit that has
[52:46] to leave the offices
[52:48] amen
[52:50] and so we get so tied up in everything
[52:52] but the holy spirit sometimes yes but
[52:54] the holy spirit with the baptism of the
[52:56] holy ghost waiting out there to meet the
[52:59] enemy on any grounds he comes upon to
[53:03] meet the enemy with the word of god
[53:09] amen
[53:10] now people say oh we only want the word
[53:11] we only want to hear
[53:13] but the word of god is in the offices
[53:17] yes
[53:18] that are led by the spirit of god yes
[53:21] amen
[53:22] each one backing one another up amen
[53:26] working together yeah backing each other
[53:28] up
[53:29] not tearing each other down
[53:32] amen
[53:33] lifting each other up
[53:35] lifting it up with him the chief captain
[53:38] not out there in the front up here or
[53:40] back behind but in them brother branham
[53:43] said
[53:44] not not the captain's not leading from
[53:45] the front or back where he's leading
[53:47] from inside
[53:49] he's leading the church from inside
[53:53] so the church isn't led by a group of
[53:55] men or a general overseer or presbyter
[53:58] but it's led from inside by the holy
[54:01] ghost
[54:03] if that's what i say amen
[54:06] and it's led through these offices that
[54:08] he has that if so if you if god's got a
[54:10] program there it is
[54:16] and never has there been a time brothers
[54:18] and sisters never has there been a time
[54:21] of attack on the ministry brother ben
[54:24] that we're seeing today
[54:27] there's a layout to see an ecumenical
[54:29] spirit at work in the message of the
[54:32] hour
[54:34] you remember he said he'll get to where
[54:36] you preachers can't preach anymore oh
[54:38] yeah that's right is that right the
[54:40] ecumenical council
[54:42] he said and so we find the end of this
[54:44] it's such a time of attack on the
[54:47] ministry
[54:49] where's this attack coming from why the
[54:52] attack on the ministry
[54:54] if we believe the message of the hour
[54:56] brother i apologize
[54:58] these are not quotes that i
[55:00] sent these are some that i grabbed on
[55:02] the way out
[55:03] these are the ones on paper uh
[55:07] but y'all y'all can look it up when you
[55:09] get home okay yeah or you can look it up
[55:11] right now i don't care but
[55:14] all right
[55:15] all right but i'm just gonna i'm gonna
[55:17] read to you some of what brother brown
[55:18] said y'all tell me if you agree with it
[55:19] or not okay
[55:21] amen
[55:25] brother brown says in divine healing the
[55:27] message divine healing he says god has
[55:29] set some in the church to be teachers
[55:31] some for different gifts some prophets
[55:34] some different things he set them in a
[55:35] church for the perfecting of the church
[55:39] you all believe that don't you
[55:41] you're taught that that scripture we
[55:44] might try to say
[55:45] it was for some other day
[55:49] we might try to say
[55:51] that it was for some other day
[55:53] but we're only trying to hide behind our
[55:58] unbelief
[56:04] look it up i don't care but i'm reading
[56:06] straight from the message of the hour
[56:08] he said
[56:10] we're he he said we're only trying to
[56:12] hide behind our unbelief yes see we're
[56:14] guilty as people of having a personal
[56:16] preference yes sir we have personal
[56:18] preferences things that we prefer over
[56:20] others some like to have a louder
[56:23] service some like to have a more a more
[56:25] cerebral service so so what we do is we
[56:28] we we find all the quotes where brother
[56:29] graham talked about what we like
[56:32] and it's our personal preference but
[56:34] then we make it say what we wanted to
[56:36] say
[56:38] amen yeah
[56:39] that's our personal preference that's
[56:41] not doctrine saints
[56:45] is that right yeah so we find the quotes
[56:48] that agree with the way we want to see
[56:50] it
[56:51] amen
[56:53] but but jesus told them to believe all
[56:57] that the prophet spoke yeah
[57:00] amen
[57:02] and so we find then he says it's the
[57:04] hide behind our unbelief god's word
[57:06] never changes it doesn't alter it's the
[57:08] same yesterday today and forever now let
[57:11] me ask you something church
[57:12] have we missed the rapture
[57:15] come on have we missed the rapture
[57:18] i hope we haven't missed the rapture
[57:20] i'd like to think that i'm in tune
[57:22] enough with the spirit of god to know
[57:23] whether god's spirit's left the earth or
[57:24] not
[57:26] see that's why people will go right on
[57:27] living and not knowing that the rapture
[57:29] happened because they don't know nothing
[57:30] about the spirit of god anyway
[57:32] amen but i'd like to think the bride is
[57:34] in tune enough with the spirit of god to
[57:37] know that the spirit of god is still
[57:38] here
[57:41] amen that's right
[57:44] and the reason i ask you that's because
[57:45] the resurrection of jurassic's daughter
[57:47] brother brown says but he sets some in
[57:48] the church teachers apostles prophets
[57:50] gifts of healing working in miracles and
[57:52] all those things are said in the church
[57:54] do you believe that i never did say
[57:57] where they'd be set out of the church
[58:02] he set them in the church for the
[58:04] perfecting of the church and to be in
[58:07] the church until he comes again
[58:14] he set him in the church
[58:16] to be perfecting the church
[58:18] until he comes
[58:20] the again
[58:21] [Music]
[58:22] hey man i wish i had to send them to my
[58:23] brothers back there so y'all don't have
[58:25] to take my word for it
[58:30] message go tell god never sent a man
[58:34] lest to give him something to say
[58:41] i'm gonna skip ahead some so we don't
[58:42] have one in morning services again
[58:50] can i go a little deeper
[58:52] gifts 56 brother brandon said god sets
[58:54] them in the church because one would be
[58:57] an apostle the prophet couldn't say
[58:58] you're not it yep
[59:00] or the pastor to the evangelist and so
[59:02] forth but they're all little lines of
[59:05] god that's put in the church for the
[59:07] perfecting of the saints
[59:09] they're all little lines of god put in
[59:12] the church
[59:13] for the perfecting of the saints can we
[59:15] go deeper yeah yeah come on now if you
[59:17] see a man here prophesying and another a
[59:20] pastor one evangelist another a teacher
[59:23] now you can't say you're not it you're
[59:25] not in it because it's just one of them
[59:28] raised off of god
[59:31] he said it's one of them lines it's one
[59:33] of them raised
[59:36] off of god
[59:39] is that right
[59:41] he said it's just one of them raised off
[59:43] of god it all points right back to god
[59:47] that
[59:48] big master diamond don't forget that now
[59:52] saints if you see a gift or an operation
[59:55] it better point back to the master
[59:57] diamond yes sir
[59:59] and if it's not pointing back to it
[1:00:01] you've got to question where that gift
[1:00:02] comes from yes yes amen because remember
[1:00:05] it's got to be led by the holy spirit
[1:00:07] yes the holy spirit leading the church
[1:00:10] with these little lines these little
[1:00:12] rays
[1:00:16] and they all gotta point back to you
[1:00:22] thank you can we go a little deeper yeah
[1:00:25] i'm gonna i'm gonna skip ahead
[1:00:30] baum and gilead 59 apostles prophets
[1:00:32] teachers pastors evangelists these
[1:00:34] officers of god sets in the church
[1:00:36] they're all in operation or should be
[1:00:40] we cannot
[1:00:42] bypass one
[1:00:48] good one and say there's teachers
[1:00:50] without saying evangelists
[1:00:52] we cannot say there's evangelists
[1:00:54] without saying there's apostles we
[1:00:57] cannot say there's apostles without
[1:00:59] admitting there's prophets
[1:01:02] all of them are for the perfecting of
[1:01:05] the
[1:01:08] body the saints as far as i can tell
[1:01:11] i've just set up here and read a bunch
[1:01:12] of quotes to you
[1:01:14] amen
[1:01:15] so if you don't agree with it you're not
[1:01:17] disagreeing with me
[1:01:25] now i believe this is pressure event 62.
[1:01:28] so it's almost getting late enough in
[1:01:30] the message to where you can listen to
[1:01:32] it right after 62.
[1:01:36] brothers and sisters i believe this
[1:01:37] message from 47
[1:01:39] all the way up to 65 anything in between
[1:01:45] hey man the understanding was a little
[1:01:46] greater but yeah
[1:01:50] it doesn't change what was spoken
[1:01:52] amen
[1:01:53] now i believe there's a church coming
[1:01:55] into that perfection that ministry of
[1:01:57] perfection ministry of perfection saints
[1:02:00] don't you don't you understand that
[1:02:02] there's all these offices there's only
[1:02:04] one office that's under attack and it's
[1:02:05] the preachers
[1:02:09] nobody's complaining about missionaries
[1:02:12] nobody's complaining about teachers
[1:02:16] sunday school's fine
[1:02:18] it's only the preacher
[1:02:21] and i believe there's a church coming
[1:02:22] into that perfection that ministry of
[1:02:24] perfection where the offices were the
[1:02:26] apostles prophets teachers pastors
[1:02:28] evangelists for the perfecting of the
[1:02:31] church them pastors and teachers and so
[1:02:33] forth will be so
[1:02:36] with the word brother ben yes sir until
[1:02:39] the whole thing will work right up to
[1:02:42] the coming of the lord yes
[1:02:46] i believe that and i believe we're
[1:02:49] nearing that time now i believe so yes
[1:02:54] so there's a ministry coming is this
[1:02:56] mine
[1:02:59] there's a ministry coming and they'll be
[1:03:02] so in tune why by the holy spirit saying
[1:03:05] yes yes sir

[1:03:11] christ doesn't bring complexes it brings
[1:03:13] love

[1:03:17] amen and so if it's led by the holy
[1:03:19] spirit it leads to the perfecting of the
[1:03:20] church yes
[1:03:24] you say you say i only need the tapes

[1:03:47] brown said questions and answers dearly
[1:03:49] beloved uh let's see about the scripture
[1:03:52] ephesians 4 11 through 13. do we all
[1:03:56] do we all get the perfecting of saints
[1:03:59] through the tapes
[1:04:01] or should we be here
[1:04:03] where the gifts of the spirit are
[1:04:04] operating and the different offices of
[1:04:07] the church to help perfect us
[1:04:10] our hearts have believed all the word of
[1:04:12] the lord so the question was asked yes
[1:04:15] that we get everything that we need from
[1:04:17] the tapes
[1:04:22] see these spirits that we're fighting

[1:04:44] they want to come here to the church for
[1:04:45] perfection

[1:04:58] where's this coming from
[1:05:00] see
[1:05:01] we get to fellowship with one another
[1:05:03] here at the church but perfecting comes
[1:05:05] between us and god

[1:05:12] is what perfects us

[1:09:37] now people don't act like that yeah
[1:09:40] that's true but the highest office
[1:09:43] in the five-fold is the pastor
[1:09:48] amen
[1:09:49] the most important thing of the day is a
[1:09:50] good god sent preacher he said
[1:09:53] god sent very important that's key yeah
[1:09:55] that's key
[1:09:57] yeah amen

[1:10:03] anything could be done in anything else
[1:10:05] is a preacher a man who knows how to
[1:10:07] rightly divide the word of god it's the
[1:10:10] most wonderful gift in the world is to
[1:10:12] be a
[1:10:13] minister amen brother ben i got to call
[1:10:16] those things that aren't as though they
[1:10:18] were yeah
[1:10:19] it doesn't feel like a wonderful gift
[1:10:21] all the time
[1:10:23] amen
[1:10:24] but brother i'm just saying what brother
[1:10:26] brown said he says the most wonderful
[1:10:28] gift in the world yes
[1:10:30] it's to be a minister
[1:10:33] i keep hearing about god's program my
[1:10:35] new ministry brother abraham said
[1:10:38] quote unquote preaching is god's program
[1:10:41] yes
[1:10:51] wisdom versus faith we've got something
[1:10:53] to do ourself you've got something to do
[1:10:56] here's the gospel i know it but if you
[1:10:58] just sit here and don't preach it what
[1:11:00] good is it going to do come on now see
[1:11:02] you got something to do you got to make
[1:11:04] an effort
[1:11:07] things that are to be 65. i'm
[1:11:09] as i'm beginning to get old and now and
[1:11:12] and know that my days are numbered and
[1:11:14] now uh know now that these young men can
[1:11:18] take this message and sweep it on to the
[1:11:21] coming of the lord if he doesn't come in
[1:11:24] my generation yes
[1:11:27] what hearst thou elijah 59 if god called
[1:11:30] you to preach preach if you stand alone
[1:11:32] preach anyhow
[1:11:34] god spoke to you stand out there and
[1:11:36] preach at your god-given right yes
[1:11:44] amen yes
[1:11:50] church age
[1:11:51] i sincerely believe that the spirit of
[1:11:53] god has been speaking to us
[1:11:55] not only teaching us the truths of all
[1:11:57] ages
[1:11:58] but he has been faithfully dealing with
[1:12:00] the hearts
[1:12:01] that they may turn to him
[1:12:04] that's the reason
[1:12:05] for all preaching and teaching
[1:12:08] for it is in the preaching and teaching
[1:12:10] of the word that the sheep hear the
[1:12:12] voice of god
[1:12:14] and follow him
[1:12:20] yes church age book the church systems
[1:12:23] will persecute the true bride
[1:12:26] the church
[1:12:27] systems
[1:12:28] will persecute the true bride this image
[1:12:31] will try to keep the bride from
[1:12:33] preaching and teaching her ministers
[1:12:36] will be forbidden to give comfort and
[1:12:38] truth to the people who need it yes sir
[1:12:41] yeah come on
[1:12:43] yeah that's good
[1:12:46] yeah
[1:12:47] that's good come on absolutely no matter
[1:12:49] what your experience is then if
[1:12:51] something tells you that the bible isn't
[1:12:53] true that the power of god apostles
[1:12:55] prophets and teachers and pastors and
[1:12:57] the gifts of the spirit isn't the same
[1:12:59] as it was when it flowed through them
[1:13:00] apostles at pentecost then there is
[1:13:03] something wrong with your absolute yes
[1:13:12] amen yeah
[1:13:18] we'll skip ahead a little bit
[1:13:24] what does it take to make a christian
[1:13:25] life brother brown says and when you
[1:13:27] have these little temper fits and fly
[1:13:28] out
[1:13:29] and you tell lies and you proselyte and
[1:13:32] jump the fences and so selfish with your
[1:13:34] organization you're so narrow-minded you
[1:13:38] couldn't hear another minister just
[1:13:40] remember the holy spirit isn't ticking
[1:13:43] inside of you
[1:13:48] this was for you brother joel yeah
[1:13:51] israel in the church if god can use the
[1:13:53] tongue of a dumb mule to talk
[1:13:56] surely he can use a man or a woman
[1:14:00] that'll surrender himself to god
[1:14:07] [Applause]
[1:14:12] thank the lord
[1:14:22] i've been listening brother joel he's
[1:14:24] been doing a good job
[1:14:26] very solid
[1:14:31] oh man let's move forward
[1:14:38] people say i don't want to be deceived
[1:14:40] so i don't want to listen to anybody
[1:14:42] preaching i only want to hear what
[1:14:44] brother branham says
[1:14:45] and so so if you don't want to be
[1:14:47] deceived your concern is about being
[1:14:49] deceived you've got larger concerns
[1:14:51] because that would mean you're not part
[1:14:52] of the bride
[1:14:56] so i wouldn't worry about being deceived
[1:14:59] i would worry about being part of the
[1:15:00] bride
[1:15:02] because the bride can't be deceived
[1:15:05] amen
[1:15:06] if i go to a baptist church it's not
[1:15:08] going to deceive me
[1:15:10] amen if a brother says something i don't
[1:15:12] quite agree with it's not going to
[1:15:14] deceive me
[1:15:15] i'm not going to just walk away and say
[1:15:17] i don't hear the message of the hour
[1:15:19] anymore
[1:15:30] and the people that don't want to hear
[1:15:31] people preach don't mind watching any
[1:15:34] kind of filth on
[1:15:36] tv as long as there's not a preacher now
[1:15:39] we can watch any kind of nasty movie or
[1:15:41] any kind of filth on the internet that's
[1:15:43] all well and good but as long as it's
[1:15:45] not a preacher
[1:15:47] preacher
[1:15:49] amen
[1:15:50] saints the people won't try to make you
[1:15:52] pick a side
[1:15:54] oh yeah
[1:15:55] you know what this morning that message
[1:15:57] i heard stirred my heart it helped me
[1:16:01] yes sir what it didn't do was make me
[1:16:03] not love brother branham
[1:16:08] i don't i don't love the tapes less
[1:16:10] because i heard brother ben this morning
[1:16:12] i love them more
[1:16:14] amen
[1:16:15] because remember this is all just little
[1:16:17] lines
[1:16:19] little licks of fire yeah
[1:16:21] coming off the big diamond
[1:16:23] amen it's all the same saints yes it
[1:16:27] works together yes to perfect the bride
[1:16:30] that's right
[1:16:31] if it's led by the holy
[1:16:32] spirit yes that's right amen
[1:16:39] and it's never been the program of god
[1:16:43] to crown a king
[1:16:45] [Music]
[1:16:49] you remember they had the word of the
[1:16:50] lord
[1:16:51] in the days of samuel the prophet
[1:16:53] they had the word of the lord
[1:16:55] yes they did but it was you know it was
[1:16:57] too boring for him
[1:16:59] that's right
[1:17:00] one fancy enough
[1:17:02] it wasn't new enough
[1:17:04] yeah
[1:17:05] and they got tired of it
[1:17:08] and they wanted a king
[1:17:11] and so they they asked samuel i said you
[1:17:12] know your sons are not they're not like
[1:17:14] you and and you know you're getting old
[1:17:16] and and we'd like to have a king because
[1:17:18] we won't be like everybody else
[1:17:20] well the bride ain't like everybody yeah
[1:17:24] we'll be like everybody else
[1:17:27] hey man yes we want to have all these
[1:17:30] programs and all this all this
[1:17:32] organization we want all that stuff it
[1:17:34] won't be like everybody else
[1:17:36] and so so samuel went to the lord and
[1:17:38] the lord said don't go ahead and give it
[1:17:40] to them that's fine
[1:17:41] but they hadn't rejected you they
[1:17:43] rejected me because that was my way
[1:17:47] amen
[1:17:49] amen
[1:17:50] that was my way see man always wants
[1:17:52] somebody to look at yes
[1:17:56] they don't want the holy spirit they
[1:17:57] want somebody they can look at yeah
[1:18:00] amen
[1:18:01] this happens all over yeah and it
[1:18:03] happens in the message yes
[1:18:05] i mean there's godly men
[1:18:07] that get lifted up in themselves and
[1:18:09] people the first thing you know they get
[1:18:10] to talking to them and tell them oh
[1:18:11] brother you're so wonderful and they
[1:18:12] start believing it
[1:18:16] amen
[1:18:17] they start believing it right you know i
[1:18:19] am pretty wonderful
[1:18:22] you're right brother i'm pretty
[1:18:23] fantastic
[1:18:26] and and so we get lifted up
[1:18:30] and and then we want to put
[1:18:32] we want to put
[1:18:34] too much faith in man yes
[1:18:40] there's not a man that won't fail you
[1:18:42] that's right
[1:18:44] amen
[1:18:45] and we we can be led to the lord and we
[1:18:46] can do the very best that we can to live
[1:18:48] our lives but all of us make mistakes
[1:18:50] brothers right yes every one of us make
[1:18:52] mistakes amen
[1:18:54] i was trying to get in the wrong truck
[1:18:58] man
[1:19:01] we all make mistakes we're human
[1:19:03] amen
[1:19:06] but there's only one that has the power
[1:19:08] of infallibility
[1:19:11] is that right yeah
[1:19:13] church age book let's look at this
[1:19:15] we'll spend just a little time here
[1:19:17] those

[1:19:41] revelations in the message and see
[1:19:43] there's a lot of people that are looking
[1:19:45] to other people to be their holy spirit
[1:19:48] there's a lot of people watching a lot
[1:19:49] of other people and deciding whether
[1:19:51] it's okay or not

[1:20:15] your kids will try to tell you what all
[1:20:16] the other kids are allowed to do and
[1:20:18] what they ain't i don't care yeah
[1:20:20] amen they're my kids i had to go as i
[1:20:22] feel led is that right as parents you
[1:20:24] have to do that that's churches you have
[1:20:26] to do that right as individuals you have
[1:20:27] to do that it doesn't matter what
[1:20:28] everybody else is doing yes that's right
[1:20:30] amen it's all right for some to eat meat
[1:20:32] but some to eat mean it would be a sin
[1:20:33] is that right is that what the bible
[1:20:34] teaches
[1:20:36] so we're not all the same
[1:20:38] yeah amen you got to go as you
[1:20:41] feel led to go
[1:20:42] and so does the collective revelation
[1:20:45] those that say that they're going to
[1:20:46] come together through a collective
[1:20:47] revelation he says i challenge that
[1:20:50] statement
[1:20:51] it's a bald and valid assumption in the
[1:20:53] face of revelations 10 7.
[1:20:57] now i do not deny that the people will
[1:20:59] prophesy in the last age and their
[1:21:02] ministers ministries can and will be
[1:21:05] correct
[1:21:06] i do not deny that there will be
[1:21:08] prophets even as in the days of paul
[1:21:11] when there was one agabus of prophet who
[1:21:14] prophesied of famine
[1:21:15] i agree that that is so but i deny
[1:21:18] upon the infallible evidence of the word
[1:21:21] that there is more than one major
[1:21:24] prophet messenger who will reveal the
[1:21:26] mysteries as contained in the word and
[1:21:29] who has the ministry to turn the hearts
[1:21:32] of the children to the fathers yes
[1:21:36] thanks let me let me paraphrase this and
[1:21:38] say there's only one
[1:21:40] brother branham
[1:21:42] all right
[1:21:43] there's only one
[1:21:45] word prophet yes
[1:21:48] there was only there were seven stars
[1:21:51] yes yes sir in the right hand
[1:21:54] yes sir right and the seven stars were
[1:21:56] the seven messengers to the seven ages
[1:21:59] yes
[1:22:00] amen and the letter was written to the
[1:22:02] messenger
[1:22:04] of the church
[1:22:06] of laodicea
[1:22:08] amen
[1:22:10] amen
[1:22:10] yes sir
[1:22:12] yes
[1:22:13] thus saith the lord by his unfailing
[1:22:16] word stands and shall stand and be
[1:22:20] vindicated there is one prophet
[1:22:22] messenger to this age on the basis of
[1:22:26] human behavior alone
[1:22:28] anyone knows that where there are many
[1:22:30] people there is even divided opinion on
[1:22:32] lesser points of a major doctrine which
[1:22:35] they all hold together
[1:22:38] in this church today
[1:22:40] there's going to be
[1:22:42] doctrines that we all hold true but we
[1:22:44] got a little differing opinion on yeah
[1:22:47] sure
[1:22:47] hey man
[1:22:48] right yeah
[1:22:50] right so so you can't have a bunch of
[1:22:52] revelation the whole collective
[1:22:53] revelation
[1:22:54] he said
[1:22:56] he said divided opinion lesser points to
[1:22:59] he says who then will have the power of
[1:23:02] infallibility
[1:23:03] which is to be restored in this last age
[1:23:06] for this last age is going to go back to
[1:23:10] manifesting the pure word bride that
[1:23:12] means that we will have the word once
[1:23:15] again as it was perfectly given and
[1:23:18] perfectly understood in the days of paul
[1:23:22] and i'll tell you who'll have it it will
[1:23:24] be a prophet as thoroughly vindicated or
[1:23:26] even more thoroughly vindicated than was
[1:23:29] any prophet in all the ages from enoch
[1:23:31] to this day because this man will of
[1:23:33] necessity have the capstone prophetic
[1:23:36] ministry and god will shoot him forth
[1:23:39] and he won't need to speak for himself
[1:23:41] god will speak for him by the voice of
[1:23:44] the sign amen
[1:23:46] yes sir amen amen
[1:23:50] and it is this office
[1:23:53] remember the the message was to the
[1:23:55] messenger
[1:23:59] and the
[1:24:00] messenger revealed the word
[1:24:03] is that right yeah
[1:24:05] so why does everybody got to reveal the
[1:24:08] revelation
[1:24:10] the revelation is given
[1:24:15] we just need to receive it yes amen
[1:24:18] and so we find then
[1:24:20] that all the other offices in ephesians
[1:24:24] 4
[1:24:25] should be getting their food the
[1:24:28] evangelist the missionary the teacher
[1:24:31] the pastor
[1:24:32] yeah from this one word prophet yes
[1:24:35] jesus that's right
[1:24:37] yes sir amen yes you need to be thankful
[1:24:41] for your pastor
[1:24:42] saints amen
[1:24:45] i can tell you this i wish i'd known
[1:24:46] brother ben a long time ago
[1:24:49] he believes this message
[1:24:51] amen
[1:24:52] and so
[1:24:53] that's where the pastor is getting his
[1:24:55] food from
[1:24:56] amen from the message of the hour
[1:24:58] not from another pastor right
[1:25:01] not from another pastor
[1:25:04] see there's too many pastors
[1:25:06] that's getting their leadership from
[1:25:07] other pastors
[1:25:12] a pastor shouldn't have influence over
[1:25:14] another church
[1:25:18] oh y'all get quiet now come on now
[1:25:21] a pastor is responsible for his
[1:25:23] congregation yes amen
[1:25:26] and each local assembly is sovereign in
[1:25:29] and of itself
[1:25:30] we don't have general overseers of
[1:25:32] district presbyters
[1:25:33] amen
[1:25:35] and too many pastors
[1:25:37] are are afraid to stand on what the lord
[1:25:40] is showing them they're looking to other
[1:25:42] pastors with their leadership
[1:25:45] amen
[1:25:47] that's not the program
[1:25:49] the program is to look to the messenger
[1:25:51] to look to the bible yes yes sir amen
[1:25:55] amen
[1:25:56] don't believe this tonight yes
[1:25:59] amen
[1:26:00] i'm thankful for brother ben
[1:26:02] amen
[1:26:05] we got too many preachers that are
[1:26:08] getting inspiration from other preachers
[1:26:13] why is everybody trying to preach this
[1:26:14] thing
[1:26:17] you got to be what you are brother joel
[1:26:19] you ain't nobody else
[1:26:21] man i can't be brother ben yeah
[1:26:24] preach come on all right brother joel
[1:26:26] you got to preach like you preach
[1:26:28] we can't mimic other preachers
[1:26:31] amen
[1:26:32] it gets to the point to where you see
[1:26:34] groups of ministers they all sound the
[1:26:35] same yeah yeah
[1:26:38] we'll just be what we are let's be
[1:26:40] genuine yes amen
[1:26:42] let's get our leadership from the lord
[1:26:44] yes remember it's the holy spirit
[1:26:46] leading the church yes
[1:26:49] the holy spirit leading the church
[1:26:52] there's some brothers it's like a
[1:26:54] they're uh
[1:26:55] god makes some of them they're like a
[1:26:57] surgical knife they go in me i'm more
[1:27:00] like a dull spoon brother ben
[1:27:06] now you can do heart surgery with either
[1:27:08] one of them but the spoon's gonna hurt a
[1:27:10] little worse
[1:27:18] we just got to be what we are saying
[1:27:20] each one of us preacher or not be what
[1:27:22] you are
[1:27:23] amen
[1:27:25] amen that's right
[1:27:27] amen
[1:27:30] god's provided way
[1:27:32] so uh let's keep going in in another
[1:27:35] little bit here this is uh one of my i
[1:27:37] guess probably if you got a favorite uh
[1:27:40] uh this would be one of my favorites in
[1:27:42] the sumernian church age brother brown
[1:27:44] says
[1:27:45] notice here that jesus by the spirit in
[1:27:47] every age addresses himself to only one
[1:27:50] person
[1:27:52] that's relative to the word for that age
[1:27:54] only one messenger for each age receives
[1:27:56] what the spirit has to say to that age
[1:28:00] and that one messenger is the messenger
[1:28:02] to the true church
[1:28:05] god speaks or he speaks for god
[1:28:08] by revelation to the churches both true
[1:28:10] and false
[1:28:12] the message is then
[1:28:14] broadcast to all
[1:28:17] but all the though it is broadcast for
[1:28:20] all who come within range of the message
[1:28:22] that message is received
[1:28:25] individually
[1:28:27] only a certain qualified group in a
[1:28:30] certain way each individual of that
[1:28:32] group is one who has the ability to hear
[1:28:36] what the spirit is saying by way of the
[1:28:39] messenger yes thank you
[1:28:42] see it's not a collective revelation
[1:28:44] saints right it's you and god
[1:28:48] and are you thankful tonight you have
[1:28:50] the ability to hear what god is saying
[1:28:52] by way of the messenger
[1:29:00] i love this next part he said those who
[1:29:02] here are not getting their own private
[1:29:04] revelation yeah that's right
[1:29:08] yes nor is a group getting their
[1:29:10] collective revelation
[1:29:13] but each person is hearing and receiving
[1:29:16] what the messenger has already received
[1:29:20] from god
[1:29:22] amen
[1:29:24] now i'm not saying god doesn't show you
[1:29:26] things god the lord shows you things in
[1:29:28] the word yeah i hope the lord's showing
[1:29:30] you things in the world
[1:29:32] every time you open the word the lord
[1:29:33] should be showing somebody you're not
[1:29:34] getting a new revelation only to you
[1:29:37] amen you're enjoying the blessings of
[1:29:39] the revealed word for this day yes
[1:29:42] amen
[1:29:47] let me skip down just a little bit here
[1:29:50] in every age we have the exactly the
[1:29:53] same pattern
[1:29:55] that is why the light comes through some
[1:29:57] god-given messenger in a certain area
[1:30:00] and then from that messenger there
[1:30:03] spreads the light through the
[1:30:09] ministry yes
[1:30:13] let's see i've been told there ain't no
[1:30:14] ministry but brother branham
[1:30:16] yeah
[1:30:17] but brother brown said that the light is
[1:30:19] then spread through the ministry
[1:30:22] of others who have been faithfully
[1:30:24] taught
[1:30:28] i'm thankful there's a few that's been
[1:30:29] faithfully taught
[1:30:33] and and the light spreads through the
[1:30:35] ministry of those who've been faithfully
[1:30:37] taught
[1:30:38] but
[1:30:39] but of course all those who go out don't
[1:30:42] always learn how necessary it is to
[1:30:45] speak only what the messenger has spoken
[1:30:50] remember paul warned the people to say
[1:30:53] what he said
[1:30:54] first corinthians 14 37 if any man think
[1:30:56] himself to be a prophet or spiritual let
[1:30:58] him acknowledge the things that i write
[1:31:00] unto you are the commandments of the
[1:31:01] lord
[1:31:02] yes let me skip down just a little bit
[1:31:05] brother said they add here
[1:31:08] or take away there
[1:31:10] and soon the message is no longer pure
[1:31:17] and the revival dies down yes
[1:31:21] how careful we must be to hear one voice
[1:31:24] for the spirit has but one voice which
[1:31:28] is the voice of god the spirit has one
[1:31:31] voice yes
[1:31:33] it's the voice of god
[1:31:35] amen
[1:31:39] paul warned them to say what he said
[1:31:41] even as peter did likewise he warned
[1:31:43] them even he paul could not change one
[1:31:45] word of what he had given by revelation
[1:31:48] oh how important it is to hear the voice
[1:31:50] of god by way of his messengers and then
[1:31:53] say what's been given them to say to the
[1:31:56] churches yes
[1:31:58] so the prophet said we need to hear what
[1:32:00] he said and then say what he said to the
[1:32:02] church yes sir
[1:32:04] right
[1:32:06] [Music]
[1:32:08] there's the program
[1:32:12] notice it was a ministry
[1:32:14] there is a ministry
[1:32:16] to say what he said yes sir yes to the
[1:32:19] church
[1:32:22] god uses men who are called
[1:32:24] now we do have many that are not called
[1:32:28] yeah
[1:32:29] and we have many people that aren't
[1:32:31] called to anything that's feel the need
[1:32:33] to give counsel
[1:32:35] yeah oh yeah
[1:32:36] come on preach yeah
[1:32:39] there's a whole lot of folks that are
[1:32:40] giving counsel that need to be receiving
[1:32:42] counsel yeah
[1:32:44] all right
[1:32:46] remember brother graham talked about the
[1:32:47] king
[1:32:48] that got lifted up
[1:32:51] and he went in and tried to take a
[1:32:52] minister's place
[1:32:54] is that right yes and he rebuked the
[1:32:57] full gospel businessmen
[1:32:59] but because he said you're you're
[1:33:00] successful in your business he said but
[1:33:02] but that don't mean you need to be
[1:33:03] preaching yeah because you're successful
[1:33:06] in your business he said you got to be
[1:33:08] what god called you to be
[1:33:11] amen
[1:33:12] and he said you should always let a
[1:33:14] minister do that preaching because as
[1:33:16] oral roberts said it's hard enough to
[1:33:19] keep the thing clear by ministers let
[1:33:21] alone by men who has not called for that
[1:33:23] office
[1:33:24] see you should have men there that knows
[1:33:27] and are ordained for the work he says
[1:33:31] that's right let's break it down just a
[1:33:33] little
[1:33:34] all further the only way we can keep it
[1:33:36] all straight is to believe what the
[1:33:37] prophet spoke yes
[1:33:40] just believe what the prophet's book
[1:33:42] amen anywhere you see where people get
[1:33:45] off it's because somewhere another there
[1:33:46] was unbelief in what the prophet spoke
[1:33:49] sure yes
[1:33:52] this makes sense tonight
[1:34:01] and god deals with individuals that
[1:34:03] doesn't mean that he doesn't have
[1:34:05] ministers to speak it means that the
[1:34:07] pastor can get up and preach the message
[1:34:09] that god lays on his heart but it's up
[1:34:11] to you to receive it
[1:34:15] it's our job to receive what the
[1:34:17] messenger says yes amen
[1:34:20] so anybody can preach
[1:34:22] it doesn't do any good unless you
[1:34:24] receive what's been given
[1:34:26] that's an individual
[1:34:29] and so people take things that are
[1:34:31] natural and are pure and are organic
[1:34:34] they take these things that that you
[1:34:35] should do if you're a believer and you
[1:34:37] love the lord and your minds on the
[1:34:39] things of god there's just things that
[1:34:41] just happen you don't have to think
[1:34:43] about growing wool you just do grow wool
[1:34:46] because you're a sheep yes
[1:34:48] and there's natural things that are just
[1:34:50] organic that should just naturally
[1:34:52] happen yeah and we take things that are
[1:34:55] natural and organic and we set up
[1:34:57] organisms around them and we make it a
[1:34:59] work yeah
[1:35:01] amen
[1:35:02] i'll give you a great example it's a
[1:35:04] good thing to spend time in prayer or or
[1:35:08] or
[1:35:09] meditation on the things of the lord
[1:35:11] would you agree to that yes
[1:35:13] it's a great it's a good thing to do you
[1:35:15] as a christian as a believer you should
[1:35:18] just you get up in the morning and and
[1:35:20] you know you the holy spirit's there
[1:35:22] with you and you're just thinking on the
[1:35:24] things the lord and you know it's kind
[1:35:25] of quiet and you know the house is still
[1:35:27] kind of quiet the kids aren't up yet and
[1:35:29] you're just meditating on the things of
[1:35:31] the lord everybody know what i'm talking
[1:35:33] about here or maybe at night time after
[1:35:35] everybody goes to bed and and you're
[1:35:37] just sitting right there and you know
[1:35:38] you've prayed and you're just thanking
[1:35:40] god for what he's done for you and
[1:35:42] you're just thanking the lord for your
[1:35:43] life and and and thanking him for your
[1:35:45] kids and or whatever we're talking to
[1:35:47] the lord about you're just having
[1:35:48] fellowship having communion with the
[1:35:50] lord
[1:35:52] let's see we take things like that
[1:35:55] and we take that quiet time before the
[1:35:57] lord and we make it a doctrine yeah and
[1:36:00] then it becomes the word yeah you got to
[1:36:02] do this every day you got to do it every
[1:36:04] day from this time to this time and if
[1:36:06] you're not doing it this day and this
[1:36:08] time to this time then then you're
[1:36:09] probably not where you need to be
[1:36:11] and it becomes a legalism instead of a
[1:36:14] love yes sir it becomes something you do
[1:36:16] because you have to not something you do
[1:36:18] out of love because you want to
[1:36:22] and when there's legalism there's
[1:36:23] condemnation
[1:36:24] and then so oh my goodness i miss my
[1:36:27] quiet time today i'm not a good believer
[1:36:30] i'm not where i need to be lord help me
[1:36:33] we take things that are natural and are
[1:36:35] organic and we do because we love the
[1:36:37] lord and we make rituals out of them
[1:36:42] we make it a ritual we make it a work
[1:36:48] it doesn't come that way saints it comes
[1:36:50] out of love
[1:36:52] you can't make yourself pray through
[1:36:54] yeah
[1:36:57] you can't you you the lord does that
[1:37:01] amen
[1:37:03] you can't make the lord show you
[1:37:05] something yeah the lord does that when
[1:37:07] he will he's sovereign yes
[1:37:10] amen
[1:37:11] i remember preaching i think it might
[1:37:13] have been i think it might have been it
[1:37:15] might have been becky's wedding
[1:37:17] brother ben and we were down was it was
[1:37:19] that like a presbyterian church or
[1:37:21] something yeah luther lutheran church i
[1:37:24] remember
[1:37:26] walking up behind the pulpit
[1:37:28] and grabbing
[1:37:29] some piece of paper back there and i got
[1:37:31] to looking at it and it was the program
[1:37:33] for the church
[1:37:35] at this lutheran church and the program
[1:37:37] had everything laid out
[1:37:40] so it had like
[1:37:42] song number one
[1:37:44] such and such song number two such and
[1:37:46] such
[1:37:47] song number three
[1:37:49] special
[1:37:51] then it had like brother ben two and a
[1:37:53] half hours
[1:37:56] and then
[1:37:56] [Laughter]
[1:38:00] and then at the end
[1:38:03] it had
[1:38:04] it had alter service
[1:38:07] and then at the end of that
[1:38:09] it had response and anointing
[1:38:13] the church had scheduled when the
[1:38:16] anointing comes
[1:38:21] sanctuary come on
[1:38:25] they had scheduled anointing brother ben
[1:38:28] so so the lord was welcomed there
[1:38:30] yeah from 11 50 to 11 55.
[1:38:35] that's when the anointing comes yeah
[1:38:37] let's see we get that way sometimes we
[1:38:39] get so legalistic in how we do things
[1:38:41] that we get so rigid in how we do things
[1:38:44] you know brother branham kept a little
[1:38:46] book on him he said and when the lord
[1:38:48] gave him something write it down
[1:38:50] yeah amen if you're thinking about the
[1:38:52] things of god all the time the lord will
[1:38:54] just give you stuff
[1:38:56] amen yeah just be thinking about the
[1:38:58] things the lord the lord will show you
[1:38:59] some of you right now
[1:39:02] but see we can take those things that
[1:39:04] are natural and organic and done out of
[1:39:06] love and we can make it into something
[1:39:07] that's not yes to where we're trying to
[1:39:10] force that yes amen yeah come on
[1:39:14] it's good
[1:39:16] that's good this is not it's no we're
[1:39:17] not catholic we don't say hail mary's
[1:39:20] and
[1:39:21] we don't schedule when the lord blesses
[1:39:23] yeah
[1:39:24] amen
[1:39:26] we're believers yes
[1:39:28] we live this life not because we're made
[1:39:30] to because we love him yes we love him
[1:39:33] we want to serve him yes
[1:39:35] we do what we do because we love the
[1:39:39] amen i'm not doing this because i'm
[1:39:41] scared he'll send me to hell i love him
[1:39:44] for saving my soul
[1:39:46] i love him for changing my life
[1:39:54] the response and anointing yes sir
[1:39:59] people can take
[1:40:00] their pastor and make him an idol
[1:40:05] they can take their church and make it
[1:40:06] their salvation
[1:40:09] yeah they're going it's all right i'm
[1:40:10] going to this church this is the right
[1:40:12] church to go to
[1:40:15] it's an individual affair no matter what
[1:40:16] church you go to
[1:40:18] the church doesn't save you
[1:40:20] your pastor doesn't save you
[1:40:22] amen you're not an okay brother because
[1:40:25] you go to this brother's church
[1:40:28] amen yeah
[1:40:31] you know there were so many doctrines
[1:40:33] that i heard when i come in the message
[1:40:34] i keep in mind i never went to church a
[1:40:37] day in my life until i walked into a
[1:40:38] message church so all i know is the
[1:40:40] message
[1:40:42] and uh i remember when i came in it was
[1:40:44] a doctrine that there was three tapes
[1:40:46] that you played for somebody you ever
[1:40:48] heard this one there was three tapes you
[1:40:50] played for somebody
[1:40:52] and if they were bribed it was three
[1:40:54] tapes you played uh
[1:40:56] uh doors and door
[1:40:58] how the angel came to me in his
[1:40:59] commission and life story the one in
[1:41:01] california
[1:41:02] and if you pray if you play those three
[1:41:04] tapes
[1:41:04] if they were bribed they'd catch it
[1:41:09] that's a pretty good doctrine right
[1:41:10] there
[1:41:11] and then i got to thinking and so i you
[1:41:13] know when you come in you just assume
[1:41:15] everybody's telling you the truth and
[1:41:16] you assume everybody believes the same
[1:41:18] way
[1:41:20] but then i got to hearing about people
[1:41:22] that come in listening to the church
[1:41:23] ages
[1:41:24] or people that come in listening to
[1:41:26] c.o.d
[1:41:27] or somebody that read the seals and it
[1:41:29] opened their eyes and i thought well how
[1:41:30] in the world could they be believers
[1:41:32] they didn't listen to these three tapes
[1:41:38] where do we get this stuff saint
[1:41:40] where do we get this stuff
[1:41:43] when i when i first came in the message
[1:41:45] i said you i was told you do not pay
[1:41:48] for a dog
[1:41:50] because the opposite don't let the price
[1:41:51] of a dog come under your roof
[1:41:58] so if any of y'all bought a dog
[1:42:01] at any time
[1:42:05] we can't have fellowship
[1:42:13] i had a young man kept quoting to me
[1:42:16] matt fluger you remember matt he always
[1:42:18] quoted to me well brother branham said
[1:42:21] if you're going to be a bomb don't you
[1:42:22] ever work a day in your life
[1:42:28] there was anything that brother brown
[1:42:30] said that he could hear
[1:42:38] he said
[1:42:40] and i said i finally told him one day i
[1:42:42] said that's uh just go uh go pull that
[1:42:44] quote up for me and bring it yes
[1:42:47] go pull me that quota
[1:42:50] and he went about an hour later he come
[1:42:52] back
[1:42:54] he said i can't find it
[1:42:56] i said no you won't find it brother
[1:42:58] billy paul said that yeah brother billy
[1:43:00] paul said brother brent said that now i
[1:43:02] believe that's the truth yeah yeah but
[1:43:04] we got to be careful basing
[1:43:07] our thoughts and ideas on people's
[1:43:09] testimonies yes
[1:43:12] we got to be we got to base our thoughts
[1:43:14] and ideas on pure word yes
[1:43:17] amen
[1:43:20] and testimonies are wonderful and i love
[1:43:22] to hear them but i can't base my
[1:43:23] salvation on it
[1:43:25] amen and i i'm sure there's a lot of
[1:43:27] things that brother brown told a lot of
[1:43:28] people and if brother branham told me
[1:43:29] something you better know i tell you
[1:43:31] yeah if i could
[1:43:33] amen yeah
[1:43:35] so i don't fault people for giving their
[1:43:36] testimony we just can't take a testimony
[1:43:39] and turn it into a doctrine it's just a
[1:43:41] testimony
[1:43:44] and there's things that apply only to
[1:43:46] certain people and certain individuals
[1:43:49] amen if it applied to the bride it'd be
[1:43:51] on the tape
[1:43:55] [Music]
[1:43:56] yeah
[1:43:57] yes sir
[1:43:58] comforter brother brown says this i
[1:44:00] noticed coming up
[1:44:01] i just want to emphasize this brother
[1:44:03] brown's approach was so different than
[1:44:04] what we see
[1:44:07] in the message today
[1:44:09] so difference
[1:44:11] [Music]
[1:44:12] i notice coming up brother brown says
[1:44:14] the last couple of days coming from the
[1:44:16] hospital that there's a tent erected
[1:44:18] down here
[1:44:19] on the pennsylvania railroad lot it's
[1:44:21] it's it's been i believe between 9th and
[1:44:23] 10th street down here off of spring
[1:44:25] coming up there and i i said
[1:44:28] uh it had a sign
[1:44:30] said sign said gift ministry i i don't
[1:44:34] know the brother
[1:44:35] i don't know as i ever met him yeah but
[1:44:38] he's a brother
[1:44:41] and he's here in the city holding a
[1:44:42] meeting
[1:44:44] and i know i know what it means to go
[1:44:46] into a city and perhaps a city of this
[1:44:48] size and with no
[1:44:50] somebody holding back i i don't know him
[1:44:54] and he's never asked me to say this
[1:44:58] but i believe it'd be
[1:44:59] real nice
[1:45:02] if all you people wanting something
[1:45:04] somewhere to go
[1:45:07] if you'd go down here
[1:45:09] if you'd go down here our brother
[1:45:11] preached the gospel
[1:45:14] he's got to be one of christ's children
[1:45:17] or he wouldn't be out
[1:45:19] putting up this tent
[1:45:21] in this cool september weather trying to
[1:45:23] do something for our lord so this week
[1:45:27] visit our brother down there
[1:45:29] and listen
[1:45:30] to him preach
[1:45:36] brother branham's approach
[1:45:39] was to send his people down
[1:45:45] to a brother he'd never even met yeah
[1:45:47] never heard preach
[1:45:49] didn't know anything about he just saw a
[1:45:51] sign
[1:45:52] that said gift ministry
[1:45:55] and said i believe it'd be nice if y'all
[1:45:56] go down there and support him
[1:46:00] is that right or wrong
[1:46:03] now that's a little different approach
[1:46:05] than we take today
[1:46:08] why the bride can't be deceived
[1:46:15] now i'm sure the lord showed brother
[1:46:16] branham something about you
[1:46:18] but i'm just i'm telling you what he
[1:46:20] said yeah
[1:46:21] amen
[1:46:23] he didn't say don't you go over there
[1:46:24] they don't believe it like we do
[1:46:28] amen
[1:46:30] they don't they don't worship like we
[1:46:31] worship
[1:46:32] they don't got the right instruments in
[1:46:34] the church
[1:46:35] yeah they got all these crazy doctrines
[1:46:38] we we don't want nothing to do with any
[1:46:39] of that he said i don't even know the
[1:46:41] brother
[1:46:42] but it'd be nice if y'all go down there
[1:46:44] and support him yeah
[1:46:45] he said i'm sure
[1:46:46] he's trying to win somebody the lord he
[1:46:48] wouldn't be here
[1:46:51] is that right thanks
[1:46:53] his approach was right yes
[1:46:56] the prophet knew how to handle every
[1:46:58] situation yes
[1:47:00] another quote here brother brown says
[1:47:02] this and now the thing brother
[1:47:04] what's his name up here in utica i think
[1:47:06] brother graham and another brother
[1:47:07] that's pastoring there a brother shanks
[1:47:10] and something like that brother sink
[1:47:11] brother neville says brother snelling
[1:47:13] brother snelling is the pastor
[1:47:15] altogether brother stalin is the pastor
[1:47:17] up at utica now and i think their prayer
[1:47:20] meeting is on thursday night thursday
[1:47:22] night now you you know it would be real
[1:47:25] nice
[1:47:26] if we would slip up there on thursday
[1:47:29] night
[1:47:30] and show these fellas a little
[1:47:34] fellowship good see and then when
[1:47:38] brother jackson the time that he has his
[1:47:41] if we just get a little group of us
[1:47:43] together and go just keep praying keep
[1:47:45] digging yeah don't stop just like when
[1:47:48] elijah told them dig ditches out there
[1:47:52] yes
[1:47:58] amen
[1:48:00] and i'm going to close on this because i
[1:48:01] still got several things to
[1:48:03] know but i don't want to
[1:48:05] want to hold it any longer
[1:48:07] saints the misrepresentation of the
[1:48:10] message of the hour is rampant
[1:48:13] and the people take the quotes that they
[1:48:15] like to hear yes that tickle their ears
[1:48:18] and they recite those quotes over and
[1:48:20] over again
[1:48:22] without taking the entirety of the
[1:48:24] message yes and examining all that the
[1:48:27] prophet said yes and we can't do that
[1:48:30] right brother brown said that's splicing
[1:48:32] and cutting and making me say stuff i
[1:48:33] didn't say is that what he said yes he
[1:48:36] said they're taking the tapes and
[1:48:37] they're splashing and cutting yeah
[1:48:41] amen
[1:48:42] well we're doing the same thing with
[1:48:43] with pulling these five quotes that we
[1:48:45] like yes
[1:48:54] now brother brown said in the voice of
[1:48:55] god in this last days he said today one
[1:48:57] reason the church is in the condition in
[1:48:59] is because there's so many voices
[1:49:02] so many other voices to attract the
[1:49:04] church from the voice of god it's very
[1:49:07] doubtful many would hear the voice of
[1:49:09] god though it spoke right in their midst
[1:49:11] they perhaps wouldn't even understand it
[1:49:13] because it would be a foreign thing to
[1:49:15] them they have got themselves so much
[1:49:18] centered on the voices of the day yes
[1:49:22] now i believe i read this the last time
[1:49:24] i was here
[1:49:25] brother brown said that to so many
[1:49:27] voices
[1:49:28] yes in the church today that the people
[1:49:31] would be a doubtful thing that they
[1:49:32] would recognize the voice of god though
[1:49:34] it spoke right in their midst yes
[1:49:37] amen
[1:49:39] now i've had this very quote quoted to
[1:49:41] me brother ben to say see there
[1:49:44] see causation doesn't equal correlation
[1:49:48] correlation doesn't equal causation
[1:49:50] y'all know what happened amen
[1:49:52] so like
[1:49:53] people they do studies right yeah and
[1:49:56] and they say all right how many men had
[1:49:57] a heart attack here all right well how
[1:49:59] many of you men eat red meat
[1:50:01] all right well red meat if 80 of you men
[1:50:05] eat red meat then 80
[1:50:07] of you had a heart attack then that must
[1:50:09] mean that red meat causes heart attacks
[1:50:13] right
[1:50:14] come on
[1:50:16] now
[1:50:17] they didn't mention that they eat red
[1:50:19] meat in the form of a cheap greasy
[1:50:21] cheeseburger
[1:50:22] and they had the fries and they smoked
[1:50:23] cigarettes with it
[1:50:25] right yeah right
[1:50:28] so causation
[1:50:30] is not always because of correlation yes
[1:50:32] right
[1:50:35] and so we can't take the message and say
[1:50:37] brother branham said this so this must
[1:50:40] mean that
[1:50:42] amen brother brown said there's too many
[1:50:45] voices so that must mean that we don't
[1:50:47] need any other voice for brother browns
[1:50:53] correlation doesn't equal causation
[1:50:58] but if we read a little deeper into what
[1:51:00] brother brown said yes
[1:51:02] brother brown said but there's so many
[1:51:04] voices today that takes the voice of the
[1:51:06] lord away from us
[1:51:09] he said there's the voice of pleasure
[1:51:11] yes
[1:51:13] not preaching
[1:51:15] not the voice of preachers not the voice
[1:51:17] of ministers
[1:51:18] the voice of pleasure he said
[1:51:21] and we live in a pleasure mad nation yes
[1:51:28] so many people are listening to that
[1:51:31] where they can go and have a good time
[1:51:33] yes everybody wants to have a good time
[1:51:35] as musicians come everybody wants to be
[1:51:38] entertained
[1:51:40] everybody wants to uh to to be able to
[1:51:43] relax and to have have have something
[1:51:46] done for them that ain't church things
[1:51:47] we don't come to church wanting to have
[1:51:49] a good time and relax we come to church
[1:51:52] wanting to get better
[1:51:54] we come to church wanting to get
[1:51:56] something from god
[1:51:57] amen now he did not say that these
[1:51:59] voices was preachers
[1:52:03] he said pleasure was one of the voices
[1:52:05] he said so many people are listening to
[1:52:07] that and many of them are professed to
[1:52:09] be christians some kind of an old rock
[1:52:11] and roll coming he said they they could
[1:52:13] just listen to what golly they said well
[1:52:16] i'm a christian i ought to ought to read
[1:52:18] a bible verse in the bible today yeah
[1:52:21] jesus wept he said yeah
[1:52:23] yes i'm a christian i got to read the
[1:52:25] bible today that's it's legalism saints
[1:52:28] oh i got to read the bible today because
[1:52:29] i'm a christian blah blah blah instead a
[1:52:30] real christian reads this bible every
[1:52:31] day
[1:52:32] amen
[1:52:34] someone read the bible jesus will
[1:52:37] they check in the box
[1:52:39] amen
[1:52:41] reading the bible don't make you a
[1:52:42] believer
[1:52:45] the bible's read all over the world
[1:52:48] amen
[1:52:50] now if you're a believer you're going to
[1:52:52] want to read your bible
[1:52:54] is that right
[1:53:00] that's it he says go ahead but they
[1:53:01] really get down he said but then to
[1:53:03] really get down and pray
[1:53:05] they got too many other things to
[1:53:10] do there's so many voices in the world
[1:53:15] so many things to attract our attention
[1:53:19] from god
[1:53:24] amen
[1:53:26] so these voices that we're talking about
[1:53:30] you can't say oh that's a ministry
[1:53:33] yeah come on well brandon said it was
[1:53:35] the voices that attracted your attention
[1:53:38] from the voice of god come on
[1:53:41] amen
[1:53:46] we're fine then
[1:53:51] back to our
[1:53:53] initial text of revelations 19 the
[1:53:55] people
[1:53:57] that were clothed in righteousness
[1:54:04] made themselves ready
[1:54:14] they didn't make themselves ready by
[1:54:16] running everybody else down
[1:54:18] they didn't make themselves ready
[1:54:21] by speaking evil of every brother that
[1:54:24] doesn't agree with them
[1:54:27] they didn't make themselves ready
[1:54:30] by going to a certain church or having a
[1:54:33] certain big name pastor or playing a
[1:54:35] certain tape or any of those things
[1:54:38] they didn't make themselves ready by any
[1:54:40] kind of work sakes the bride made
[1:54:43] herself ready by examining her life
[1:54:49] by the word of god for that day
[1:54:53] it is our job to examine our lives in
[1:54:57] the auspices of god's word
[1:55:00] to find the areas that we don't measure
[1:55:03] up and ask god to bring us to that
[1:55:06] standard
[1:55:07] because the bride will be clothed in
[1:55:10] righteousness
[1:55:13] not in a denomination
[1:55:15] not in somebody else's name shall be
[1:55:17] clothed in righteousness by the holy
[1:55:21] spirit
[1:55:22] our goal today our goal this afternoon
[1:55:25] is righteousness
[1:55:27] we want to be
[1:55:30] right and if we're gonna be right we
[1:55:34] gotta believe it all sake
[1:55:37] let us not stumble at one word that's in
[1:55:41] this message
