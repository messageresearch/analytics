[31:52] i still can't forget it
[31:56] it won't go away
[31:59] so i wept again lord washed my sin
[32:03] but this is all he'd say
[32:12] what's in
[32:16] what's in it was gone
[32:20] as the east is from the west
[32:28] what's in
[32:32] what's in it was gone
[32:36] the very minute you confessed
[32:44] buried in the sea
[32:48] of forgetfulness
[32:57] the heaviest thing you'll ever carry
[33:01] is a load of guilt and chains
[33:06] you were never meant to bury
[33:10] so let them go in jesus
[33:13] name our god is slow to anger
[33:18] and quick to forgive our sins
[33:23] so let them put them under the blood and
[33:27] never bring them up again
[33:38] what's in
[33:42] what's in it's as far
[33:45] away as the east is from the west
[33:56] [Music]
[34:01] it was gone the very minute you
[34:10] buried in the sea
[34:14] of forgetfulness
[34:21] what's in
[34:26] what's in it's as far
[34:29] away as the east is from the
[34:34] [Music]

[35:14] remember everything we've ever done
[35:16] all the mistakes we've ever made but
[35:18] hard for us to fathom god can forget it
[35:20] but he can amen
[35:21] let's stand together just open our
[35:23] hearts with the word of the lord this
[35:24] evening
[35:25] i think that song will lead right into
[35:26] this really good i love that man
[35:36] that man in the middle
[35:44] it's because i know
[35:47] that he first loved me

[36:37] think about it
[36:41] [Music]
[36:51] i know that middle man who made it
[36:54] awesome that i
[36:58] could amen sing it to him
[37:13] oh because i know
[37:18] that he first
[37:20] [Music]
[37:28] that man

[37:38] [Music]
[37:47] our heads together for word of prayer
[37:50] our gracious father

[37:58] stand in the gap
[38:00] lord we're so grateful for that tonight
[38:02] we don't want to ever forget what you
[38:04] did
[38:05] that day on calvary lord and because of
[38:09] that
[38:09] we can say what sin

[38:13] lord even those things that we can
[38:15] remember you've forgotten we thank you
[38:18] for that lord
[38:19] [Music]
[38:21] what a blessing it is to know that
[38:23] though in this life we may struggle with
[38:25] memories lord and things of the past but
[38:28] god
[38:29] we know that you don't we know that you
[38:32] see us
[38:32] as the pure virtuous sinless
[38:35] unadulterated bride of jesus christ and
[38:37] we're so grateful for that
[38:40] lord i i thank you for this message lord
[38:42] that washes us by the water of the word
[38:45] thank you lord for your word that just
[38:47] comes over us and
[38:49] the lord just cleans us out and makes us
[38:51] what we ought to be
[38:53] we thank you for that i pray lord that
[38:56] you would meet every need here tonight
[38:57] maybe there'd be something i wouldn't
[38:59] know about lord
[39:00] and you just want to reach out to that
[39:02] person lord to that situation
[39:04] i pray that you would do that tonight be
[39:07] free lord to move and to move me out of
[39:10] the way
[39:11] to speak to your people we pray in jesus
[39:13] name
[39:14] amen amen do you love him tonight
[39:18] amen it's good to see you in the house
[39:21] of the lord
[39:22] turn with me to ephesians chapter 1
[39:23] verses 13 and 14.
[39:27] i um while you're turning there it's
[39:30] good to
[39:31] see brother john's sister gail with us
[39:33] tonight and
[39:34] it's always a privilege i was thinking
[39:37] about that
[39:38] they were at our wedding 15 years
[39:41] in a few days water goes under the
[39:45] bridge
[39:45] fast doesn't it i mean that's that's a
[39:47] lot of time at least it is for me some
[39:49] of y'all have been married for
[39:51] 50 60 years that's not a long time but
[39:54] for us it's a long time and and brother
[39:57] john and
[39:57] and sister gail were there for my wife
[40:00] before i met her so we appreciate them
[40:02] and
[40:03] their testimony here over the years and
[40:05] every one of you it's good to see you in
[40:07] the house of the lord tonight on a
[40:08] wednesday night i
[40:09] know there's some that are still sick
[40:11] with colds and things like that and i
[40:12] pray the lord would bless them as they
[40:14] watch
[40:15] this evening i want you to be especially
[40:19] in prayer
[40:20] for india the covet situation there is
[40:23] is awful
[40:24] and the believers are being impacted by
[40:27] it and i
[40:28] i've got to preach a service over zoom
[40:31] uh on tuesday morning about 8 30. so
[40:34] you'd be in prayer for me that will be
[40:35] able to do that and
[40:37] and preach something that would be real
[40:39] to those people because they're
[40:40] suffering
[40:41] so much right now it's just out of
[40:44] control it's kind of predictable that it
[40:45] would be in that environment but
[40:48] be praying for them especially for the
[40:49] believers there and
[40:51] maybe we could say something that would
[40:52] be a help in some way to them
[40:55] and then next week is our meetings keep
[40:58] that in your prayers starting thursday
[40:59] night
[41:00] thursday night friday night saturday
[41:02] night
[41:03] and sunday morning so be in prayer for
[41:05] the meetings coming up and i know
[41:07] there'll be some folks from out of town
[41:09] but i know it'll be a blessing to you
[41:10] that are here as well
[41:12] amen from the local church and so
[41:14] there'll be no service next wednesday
[41:16] night
[41:17] we'll start having church on thursday
[41:19] night no service next wednesday night
[41:22] let's read ephesians chapter 1 and verse
[41:24] 13.
[41:25] in whom you also trusted
[41:29] after that you heard the word of truth
[41:31] the gospel of your salvation in whom
[41:33] also
[41:34] after that you believed you were sealed
[41:36] with that holy spirit of promise
[41:38] which is the earnest of our inheritance
[41:41] until the redemption
[41:42] the purchased possession and to the
[41:44] praise of his glory i pray the lord
[41:46] would add
[41:47] his blessing to the word you may be
[41:48] seated
[41:50] i want to continue on our study on the
[41:54] breach and that may seem like a strange
[41:55] scripture but it's one that
[41:58] branham uses while he's preaching the
[42:00] breach
[42:02] and we've covered brother branham's
[42:05] introduction
[42:06] to that sermon where he talks about he
[42:09] begins to set up
[42:10] how that the opening of the seals could
[42:12] only be
[42:14] done by the lamb that it was only christ
[42:17] who could do that
[42:18] and then only the seventh angel
[42:20] messenger
[42:22] it would be his job to open the seals or
[42:24] to receive them from the lamb and
[42:26] and preach those and to reveal the
[42:28] thunders and that would be the the job
[42:31] of the seventh angel messenger and we
[42:33] found out
[42:34] that that is the seven thunders were
[42:37] those mysteries that were contained
[42:40] in the seals and now but the random
[42:43] switches
[42:44] gears in the next few paragraphs and
[42:46] begins to speak about what a seal
[42:48] is and i'm so glad he does because he
[42:51] answers some questions that
[42:53] that frankly i've had even early on in
[42:55] the message and
[42:57] he deals with some things about the holy
[42:58] ghost that i think is very important so
[43:01] we're going to get into that tonight
[43:03] when brother branham preached is this
[43:05] the sign of the answer he talks about
[43:07] several mysteries and we went over that
[43:10] list of those mysteries that were
[43:11] revealed by the seventh angel
[43:14] messenger and one of those mysteries
[43:17] was the mystery of the baptism of the
[43:19] holy ghost
[43:22] without sensation brother branham puts
[43:25] it this way he said the mystery of the
[43:26] baptism the holy ghost without sensation
[43:28] but the
[43:29] person of christ performing in you
[43:33] the same works that he did isn't that
[43:36] what you want tonight
[43:38] the person of christ performing in you
[43:40] the same works that he did
[43:43] and so in the breach brother branham
[43:44] begins to talk about that he said many
[43:46] of them i see are writing they got their
[43:48] books and
[43:49] writing the scriptures down marking them
[43:50] in their bible for a chain
[43:52] he said so that's fine i like for you to
[43:54] do that and then go home and study it
[43:56] he says and if you study it yourself
[43:59] then you'll understand it better
[44:01] you'll understand it better now some
[44:03] people will tell you this is not for you
[44:04] to understand
[44:05] but brother branham says if you'll study
[44:07] it you'll understand it better
[44:09] amen so he says if you study it yourself
[44:12] you'll understand it better just study
[44:14] it and ask god
[44:15] to help you to understand so even after
[44:17] a prophet preached it and in
[44:20] it was revealed to us we still have to
[44:22] ask god for help
[44:23] to be able to understand it amen isn't
[44:26] that the truth tonight
[44:28] amen you know why it's not because it's
[44:30] difficult it's not because it was given
[44:32] in a difficult way
[44:33] but it's hard for us to get out of the
[44:35] way enough to be able to see it
[44:37] because we bring our our preconceived
[44:40] ideas our notions our
[44:41] our flesh with john into the message of
[44:44] the hour and and we want it to be a
[44:46] certain way but that's not the way god
[44:48] called it to be
[44:48] and so it has to come by revelation
[44:52] it can't just be head knowledge and so
[44:54] brother branham says now he says we got
[44:56] the scriptures open let's see the holy
[44:57] spirit here itself
[44:59] he said the holy spirit here itself is a
[45:02] seal
[45:02] the holy spirit is a seal
[45:06] now this is important why did brother
[45:08] branham call the holy spirit a seal
[45:11] because the bible says that right and
[45:14] him being a word prophet he would say
[45:16] what the scriptures say
[45:19] so we find that even in the bible that
[45:22] christ was sealed
[45:24] do you know that the bible says that
[45:25] john chapter 6 verse 27
[45:27] labor not for the meat which perisheth
[45:29] but for that meat which endureth
[45:31] and everlasting life which the son of
[45:33] man shall give unto you for him
[45:36] hath god the father sealed he sealed him
[45:39] he
[45:40] identified he said this is my beloved
[45:43] son
[45:44] right he sealed him at the river jordan
[45:48] the father sealed him christ was sealed
[45:51] and so in second corinthians 1 21 he
[45:54] says now he
[45:55] which establishes us with you in christ
[45:58] and hath anointed us is god so in other
[46:01] words the person who
[46:03] who backs up my ministry paul's ministry
[46:06] hath anointed us is god who has also
[46:09] sealed
[46:10] us and given the earnest of the spirit
[46:13] in our hearts
[46:15] he's sealed us he's put his approval on
[46:17] us and once god approves something
[46:20] it doesn't have to go through another
[46:22] reviewing line it doesn't have to go as
[46:24] they do in the factory you know it goes
[46:26] through the
[46:26] line and then it goes down they see so
[46:28] many of them they reject and
[46:30] goes through quality control the
[46:32] christian doesn't go through quality
[46:33] control once he's been sealed
[46:36] right we don't get to we don't get to
[46:38] throw this one out and
[46:39] leave this one in but once he's sealed
[46:41] he's sealed
[46:42] god sealed him he said this is my
[46:45] beloved son
[46:46] aren't you glad you serve a god like
[46:48] that tonight this is my beloved son now
[46:51] he says he sealed us and that seal is
[46:54] permanent ephesians 4 30 and grieve not
[46:57] the holy spirit of god whereby you are
[46:59] sealed
[47:00] unto the day of redemption and brother
[47:02] branham constantly will take that and
[47:04] say not to the next revival
[47:06] right and so you weren't sealed at one
[47:08] revival and we had that wonderful
[47:10] service a couple of wednesday nights ago
[47:11] but that
[47:12] you don't lose that if you receive the
[47:15] seal of the holy spirit now you can
[47:17] shout and lose that
[47:18] because you're not always going to feel
[47:20] like shouting you can speak in tongues
[47:22] and lose that because you're not always
[47:23] going to feel
[47:24] like that that that god's not always
[47:26] going to work that way in your life
[47:27] but if you ever get sealed you can't be
[47:30] unsealed amen
[47:34] hey man you see you can't you know once
[47:37] you have a revelation
[47:39] you can't undo that you can't unsee it
[47:43] right and once you're sealed you can't
[47:45] be unsealed
[47:47] you see because the seal is god's
[47:49] revelation about you
[47:53] right god's saying this is my beloved
[47:56] son
[47:57] he's saying this is my child and no one
[47:59] else gets to change that and gets to
[48:01] take it off
[48:02] that ought to give us a security brother
[48:04] random would put it this way he said
[48:06] that ought to take the scare and
[48:08] fear away from you right because
[48:11] it means that once i'm sealed i'm in
[48:15] amen that don't make me want to go out
[48:16] and live a life of sin
[48:18] it'll make me want to go out and do what
[48:20] i want to do what but what i want to do
[48:21] is serve god
[48:23] it makes me love him so much more it
[48:25] makes me makes me cling to him and
[48:27] and it makes me despise this old flesh
[48:29] and want to crucify it on every hand why
[48:31] because i'm sealed
[48:35] amen now it feels permanent to the day
[48:38] of redemption philippians 1
[48:40] 6 being confident of this very thing
[48:42] that he which has begun
[48:44] a good work in you will perform it
[48:48] amen until the day of jesus christ
[48:51] god does the ceiling right
[48:54] who who okays the law the king does
[48:58] right he stamps it he seals it that's
[49:01] his
[49:02] work not the pastors
[49:05] right not the congregations not anybody
[49:09] else's job to tell you that you're field
[49:11] or you're not sealed
[49:13] that's his job god testifies of his
[49:16] gifts
[49:17] god seals you amen now look
[49:21] and this is important as brother branham
[49:23] is telling us what a seal is
[49:25] so we can see the opening of the seals
[49:27] now a seal
[49:29] brother branham said signifies what a
[49:31] finished
[49:32] work the holy spirit being a sealed to
[49:35] the individual
[49:37] and to that individual when he receives
[49:40] the holy spirit then his time of
[49:42] groaning
[49:43] is over i love that his time of groaning
[49:47] is over
[49:48] see because it is a finished work now we
[49:51] know in the flesh you've still grown
[49:53] because you're groaning for a new body
[49:55] right you want a new body there's
[49:58] something about the flesh that you're
[50:00] always going to have trouble
[50:01] because that's just the kind of person
[50:04] kind of way that you're made the flesh
[50:06] is
[50:06] is cursed it's going back to the dust
[50:08] but there's something inside of you
[50:10] that's quit groaning
[50:12] right it's not looking for nothing more
[50:14] it's not looking for something better
[50:16] it's not looking for another message
[50:17] somewhere why
[50:18] it's sealed it's a finished work
[50:21] and that individual his time of groaning
[50:23] is over
[50:24] because it's the finished work you don't
[50:26] have to look here and there and try to
[50:27] find something on youtube or try to find
[50:29] something on
[50:30] on the internet and find out what's
[50:31] brother random really a prophet and all
[50:33] these things so he's sealed
[50:36] you don't have to look and find some
[50:37] other teaching from somewhere else he's
[50:39] sealed he don't need a man to take him
[50:41] through
[50:43] he don't need a man to teach him every
[50:45] little thing and tell him this is what
[50:47] kind of car you need to buy and it's
[50:48] what kind of house you need to buy you
[50:49] don't need a man to do that why he's
[50:51] sealed
[50:52] he's not looking for something more not
[50:55] looking for some new doctrine he's
[50:56] sealed
[50:58] are you whipping out he's not gonna he'd
[51:00] say well brother
[51:02] if i don't go to this church up by the
[51:03] ben if i don't go to this church i'll
[51:05] miss it how could you miss the rapture
[51:06] if you're sealed
[51:10] how could you miss the rapture when
[51:11] you're already on you know it's like
[51:14] it's like saying you're missing the
[51:15] train but you're already on it
[51:19] right how can you miss a rapture it's
[51:21] all to be good
[51:27] now watch so brother brother said it's
[51:29] the finish work that individual's time
[51:31] of groaning is over
[51:32] and now he uses an analogy here and i
[51:34] want to kind of dig deep
[51:36] into this he said like i used to work
[51:38] for the railroad company and we'd load
[51:39] boxcars with cans
[51:41] and different things from the canning
[51:43] factory he said but then before that car
[51:46] could be sealed
[51:47] the inspector come around to see if that
[51:50] car was properly loaded
[51:52] he said if not the first time it rammed
[51:54] together with something
[51:55] it'd scatter the stuff and break it and
[51:58] the railroad company was responsible
[52:01] see if the inspector said it was okay
[52:04] and then it failed
[52:06] the ins the railroad company was
[52:07] responsible
[52:09] right and so if god sealed something and
[52:12] then lost it he'd be responsible for
[52:14] losing it
[52:17] right now but he says that inspector
[52:20] won't
[52:20] he won't put his seal on it until he
[52:23] sees it's properly loaded
[52:26] right and and that means it's not going
[52:28] to break
[52:29] when it's tested it's not going to
[52:32] fall apart when it's tested and it will
[52:35] be tested
[52:37] because every son of god has to be
[52:39] tested
[52:41] and some of y'all been tested in ways
[52:42] that i can't even imagine
[52:44] but you passed that test why because you
[52:47] were
[52:48] sealed hey man
[52:51] he knew you would pass it so he put his
[52:54] seal on you knowing you would pass the
[52:56] test
[52:57] there's going to be a rough road it's
[52:59] going to there's going to be a
[53:01] a jamming together of the cars there's
[53:03] going to be a shaking
[53:04] in fact the scripture says everything by
[53:06] the same that can be shaken will be
[53:08] shaken
[53:09] but during this shaking time if you're
[53:12] sealed
[53:12] you've already been inspected you've
[53:14] already been sealed god said
[53:16] you're not you're going to make it god
[53:18] said you're not going to fall apart
[53:20] god said you're not going to stay close
[53:24] you're not going to lose your belief in
[53:25] a prophet you're not going to lose your
[53:27] belief in the message
[53:28] everything else may fall around you but
[53:29] you can't shake loose
[53:31] because you're sealed hallelujah
[53:35] oh this is good stuff now look
[53:38] he said if that inspector would test
[53:42] and that inspector would test everything
[53:45] to see if it was
[53:46] properly in place
[53:49] now he said if it wasn't he condemned
[53:52] the car
[53:53] and then we had to do it all over again
[53:56] until the inspector was satisfied
[53:59] and then when the inspector is satisfied
[54:03] he shuts the door
[54:06] now what does the inspector look for
[54:11] when he inspects the car what's he
[54:14] looking for
[54:16] well he's looking for loose items
[54:20] loosely packed items now
[54:24] i might go a different direction with
[54:25] this than you think so just hang
[54:27] hang with me for a minute because i
[54:30] remember when i first started preaching
[54:32] preaching this as
[54:33] he's looking for loosely packed items so
[54:35] he's looking for
[54:36] loose life in the sense that he's
[54:39] looking to see if you cut your hair and
[54:41] wear pants and looking to see if you if
[54:45] you
[54:45] live like the world looking for
[54:47] worldliness
[54:49] that's the way i understood that and
[54:51] maybe some of you have
[54:52] as well but the problem is i couldn't
[54:56] find where brother branham said that
[54:59] when he's or where the bible teaches
[55:02] that frankly
[55:03] because it creates a paradox because
[55:06] it creates a situation where you can't
[55:08] live it without the holy ghost
[55:10] and we know that's true you can't live
[55:12] it without the holy ghost
[55:13] you need the life of christ to be able
[55:15] to live the life of christ
[55:18] right and then on the other hand you
[55:19] can't have the holy ghost until you live
[55:21] it
[55:22] if he's inspecting to make sure your
[55:23] life is lined up in that way
[55:26] are you with me now so if you can't have
[55:30] the
[55:30] holy ghost until you live it and you
[55:32] can't live without the holy ghost and
[55:33] there's no hope
[55:36] and i remember the old holiness church
[55:39] that i grew up in there was a man i
[55:40] remember
[55:41] in the independent hole in his church
[55:42] that had been seeking the holy ghost for
[55:44] 40 years
[55:46] and every time he thought he had it he'd
[55:48] lose his temper or something would
[55:49] happen and
[55:50] and he'd have to go back and seek the
[55:51] holy ghost again they called it entire
[55:53] sanctification and they would go back
[55:55] and and be entirely
[55:56] he thought well i've never been entirely
[55:58] sanctified he was at the altar
[56:00] every service for 40 years
[56:03] and never could get it because every
[56:04] time he'd make a mistake
[56:07] right and and if we're not careful we
[56:09] get that way where well with the holy
[56:10] ghost has to inspect our lives so if we
[56:12] go to the altar tonight
[56:13] we believe we receive the holy ghost we
[56:15] get up we feel better we go home
[56:17] and then we fail tomorrow well he must
[56:20] not if
[56:21] if he was inspecting us he'd say well
[56:23] that that car's gonna fail
[56:26] but there's no evidence in the new
[56:28] testament of people who had to wait
[56:29] until their lives were perfect to
[56:30] receive the holy ghost
[56:33] there's no evidence that they ever had
[56:35] to wait until the statue of a perfect
[56:37] man was perfect
[56:38] to receive the holy ghost because to
[56:41] have that statue of a perfect man you've
[56:43] got to be partakers of the divine nature
[56:47] right so it's not waiting until
[56:50] our lives are perfect but brother
[56:52] branham uses the analogy of a boxcar
[56:54] and he uses this in more than one place
[56:56] but he uses it up until
[56:58] up until this time when he preaches to
[57:00] breach
[57:01] and i can't find where he ever uses it
[57:03] again
[57:04] he does continue to use the analogy of
[57:06] the holy ghost being a seal
[57:08] but he types it instead to circumcision
[57:11] and takes it to abraham now
[57:14] just follow me for just a moment abraham
[57:16] is given the covenant
[57:17] of circumcision in genesis 17. and
[57:20] paul talks about it in romans 4 11 he
[57:22] said he received a sign of circumcision
[57:24] a seal
[57:26] of what of the righteousness of the
[57:28] faith
[57:29] which he had yet being uncircumcised
[57:32] that he might be the father of all them
[57:34] that believe though they be not
[57:35] circumcised
[57:37] that righteousness might be imputed unto
[57:39] them also now
[57:41] what was god looking for before he gives
[57:43] him the seal this covenant
[57:45] he was looking for his faith
[57:49] right and then that faith would produce
[57:52] obedience
[57:54] so there were steps of faith that
[57:57] abraham would walk through would go
[57:59] through and
[58:01] god sees that and he gives him the seal
[58:03] of circumcision
[58:06] in response to that you say where do you
[58:09] get that from well from the scripture
[58:10] watch what he says
[58:11] romans 4 12 the father of circumcision
[58:14] to them who are not of the circumcision
[58:16] only but who
[58:18] also walk in the steps of that faith
[58:22] of our father abraham which he had yet
[58:25] being uncircumcised
[58:28] and so what is the inspector looking for
[58:30] he's looking for those steps of faith
[58:34] now brother branham talks about it in
[58:36] just a little bit different way but
[58:37] what's he looking for acts chapter 2 and
[58:39] verse 38
[58:40] peter said repent be baptized every one
[58:42] of you in the name of jesus christ for
[58:43] the remission of sins
[58:44] you shall receive the gift of the holy
[58:46] ghost what's he looking for someone who
[58:47] will
[58:48] obey that someone who will believe that
[58:52] someone will take it for themself
[58:56] right someone will grab hold of that
[58:58] word and
[58:59] and say that's for me
[59:02] amen that's me amen
[59:05] and then do that right because judas
[59:09] could be justified and sanctified
[59:11] but he couldn't make it to the upper
[59:12] room but he's walking watching for
[59:15] somebody
[59:16] who has the steps of faith that is
[59:19] willing to do what god said
[59:22] and it's not because you're perfect but
[59:24] it's because you have the faith to
[59:26] believe it where did that faith come
[59:27] from
[59:28] come from god it come from the fact that
[59:31] you are a seed of god
[59:34] and that's why those in cornelius's
[59:36] house can even
[59:37] be received the holy ghost while the
[59:39] word was being preached before they'd
[59:41] ever been baptized why
[59:42] because god knew that those steps of
[59:44] faith would be evident in their lives
[59:47] and they could be sealed
[59:51] but we make it well you know if that
[59:53] person they must not have been sealed
[59:54] because they made a mistake well that's
[59:55] not it
[59:57] but let's let's just go into that like i
[59:58] said dig into it a little bit
[1:00:00] brother branham in the force field he
[1:00:02] said yes you can accept it by faith
[1:00:04] you have to accept christ by faith now
[1:00:07] he's talking about
[1:00:08] random uses this a lot how a baptist man
[1:00:10] come and said
[1:00:11] i can't believe you're teaching an
[1:00:13] apostolic doctrine he said
[1:00:14] you receive the holy ghost when you
[1:00:16] believe but the brahmana said that
[1:00:18] wasn't true
[1:00:19] because paul said have you received the
[1:00:20] holy ghost since you believed
[1:00:22] right he said you can accept it by faith
[1:00:24] you have to accept christ by faith
[1:00:25] that's exactly right and you accept
[1:00:27] the holy spirit by faith but then let
[1:00:30] the holy spirit come
[1:00:32] and give the circumcision amen
[1:00:36] as a witness that he has accepted your
[1:00:39] faith
[1:00:41] what's he inspecting for those steps of
[1:00:44] faith
[1:00:46] he's accepted your faith he looks at the
[1:00:49] boxcar and it's in order
[1:00:51] it's right it's good and
[1:00:55] and you can find where brother branham
[1:00:56] talks about this now he says he's
[1:00:58] accepted your face he didn't see abraham
[1:01:00] believed god and it was imputed him for
[1:01:01] righteousness but god gave him the sign
[1:01:03] of circumcision
[1:01:04] as a confirmation he had accepted his
[1:01:07] faith
[1:01:08] so that's the same thing we must do
[1:01:11] listen to this he said we must wait on
[1:01:13] the holy spirit
[1:01:14] until it's done something
[1:01:17] right not necessarily because we spoke
[1:01:20] in tongues
[1:01:21] not because we danced or we got
[1:01:23] emotional or we shouted
[1:01:26] and i know i i'll probably get grief for
[1:01:28] this but i know there's people who
[1:01:29] believe that they can tell
[1:01:30] if someone receives the holy ghost
[1:01:32] because of the way they cried or they
[1:01:34] shouted
[1:01:34] or they come to an altar i've
[1:01:39] i can't tell let's just put it like that
[1:01:42] based on that right but look at
[1:01:46] somebody's life
[1:01:48] what happens when they leave right and
[1:01:50] you might have two people that go
[1:01:51] through the same emotions have the same
[1:01:53] and i believe in the emotions
[1:01:55] like i said i'll stack my pentecostal
[1:01:56] credentials up with anybody
[1:01:58] i believe in the emotions but but let
[1:02:00] that go through the life and see
[1:02:02] it's that person living uh every day is
[1:02:06] there's something about it and and again
[1:02:08] you can't put the seal on it but god
[1:02:09] puts the seal on that life
[1:02:13] we must wait on the holy spirit till
[1:02:15] it's done something
[1:02:17] not necessarily because we spoke in
[1:02:18] tongues not because we danced or we got
[1:02:20] emotional or we shouted
[1:02:22] until we were changed amen until
[1:02:25] something actually happened he said i
[1:02:28] don't care what form it comes in
[1:02:30] just so it happened that's the main
[1:02:33] thing
[1:02:35] again in the token brother branham deals
[1:02:37] with this he said real genuine gospel
[1:02:39] as clean as i know it he said i know
[1:02:42] it's true
[1:02:43] do you believe we still need the gospel
[1:02:45] today we still need to hear the gospel
[1:02:47] as revelated as we are we need to hear
[1:02:49] it
[1:02:50] he said as clean as i know it i know
[1:02:51] it's true i've tried it there's no other
[1:02:53] ism no work up no schemes no gimmicks no
[1:02:56] nothing
[1:02:56] it's just pure unadulterated faith in
[1:02:59] the word of god
[1:03:01] and the finished works that god required
[1:03:03] at calvary
[1:03:04] knowing that there is nothing we could
[1:03:06] do to save ourselves
[1:03:08] we just accept what he did for us
[1:03:12] amen he said abraham believed god
[1:03:15] and it was imputed unto him for
[1:03:16] righteousness then god gave him the seal
[1:03:18] of circumcision as a token that he had
[1:03:22] received his faith
[1:03:23] he said there is the gospel
[1:03:27] amen he gave him that as a token now
[1:03:30] again in investments he said why abraham
[1:03:33] believed god it was imputed to him
[1:03:35] he said how much more can the man do and
[1:03:36] again this is this baptist man that's
[1:03:38] saying
[1:03:39] that abraham received the holy ghost
[1:03:40] when he believed
[1:03:42] he said i said truly he believed god but
[1:03:45] god vindicated it by giving the seal of
[1:03:48] circumcision
[1:03:50] he said now when you say you're a
[1:03:51] believer god has never
[1:03:54] recognized your faith until he sealed it
[1:03:57] with the baptism
[1:03:58] of the holy ghost notice what he's
[1:04:00] looking for
[1:04:02] he recognized it as a predestinated seed
[1:04:10] you realize what it means when you say
[1:04:12] you got the holy ghost
[1:04:14] you have the seal of the holy ghost
[1:04:16] that's not something to take it lightly
[1:04:18] you're saying i am a predestinated seed
[1:04:22] because god doesn't seal the book and
[1:04:24] then go back and have to rewrite it
[1:04:28] right he doesn't seal the book of
[1:04:29] redemption and go back and have to add
[1:04:31] names or take them away
[1:04:33] but he has never recognized your faith
[1:04:35] until he's sealed with the baptism
[1:04:37] of the holy ghost and he's recognized it
[1:04:39] as a predestinated seed that's what he
[1:04:41] did with jesus he said this
[1:04:42] is my beloved son
[1:04:47] hallelujah now let's go back to the
[1:04:50] breach and continue on that thought
[1:04:51] brother branham says the inspector shuts
[1:04:54] the door
[1:04:55] and go listen to the tape but the
[1:04:56] brandon puts the emphasis on the word
[1:04:58] inspector
[1:04:59] he said the inspector shuts the door the
[1:05:02] inspector places a seal upon him
[1:05:04] and then no one amen
[1:05:08] i'm so glad i don't think that tonight
[1:05:10] what sin
[1:05:14] no one can break the seal until it
[1:05:17] reaches its destination
[1:05:20] why it's predestinated seed
[1:05:23] it's identified as such not by emotion
[1:05:27] or sensation but god put his seal on it
[1:05:31] amen and the very idea of a seal again
[1:05:36] remember what i told you the seal is the
[1:05:38] mystery right
[1:05:39] the very idea of a seal you're not going
[1:05:41] to be able to prove to anybody else that
[1:05:43] you're a seed
[1:05:45] but it's a revelation to you
[1:05:48] right because the very idea of a seal
[1:05:50] denotes a mystery but there comes a day
[1:05:52] when we'll know who the seed are
[1:05:57] because only the seed go in the rapture
[1:06:01] are you with me now and that seal breaks
[1:06:05] and it's revealed but let me tell you
[1:06:07] something we're living in the age and
[1:06:08] i'm kind of getting ahead of myself now
[1:06:10] but i just feel to say this we're living
[1:06:12] in the age when
[1:06:14] the book that you are the life that you
[1:06:16] live
[1:06:17] is being revealed to you
[1:06:20] so that not only as the opening of the
[1:06:22] word and the opening of the seals come
[1:06:24] it was not only a book about the the
[1:06:27] bible and things that happened in the
[1:06:28] bible and not only a book about things
[1:06:30] that happened in church history but it's
[1:06:32] talking about you
[1:06:34] and you begin to see yourself there and
[1:06:36] it's like you're being
[1:06:37] your seal is being broken the seal that
[1:06:40] god put on you and then god says
[1:06:42] this you're you're my child you're
[1:06:44] recognizing as he has recognized you'd
[1:06:46] be predestinated seed
[1:06:47] now you're recognizing
[1:06:52] and i think if we would realize if we
[1:06:55] could really come to terms with the fact
[1:06:57] that we're the seed of god it would
[1:06:58] change everything in our lives
[1:07:00] because then how how could god do
[1:07:02] something unfairly with us
[1:07:05] how could he deal unfairly with his own
[1:07:07] children you say but but but my child my
[1:07:10] my situation i was born with this i had
[1:07:13] this problem i've had this struggle
[1:07:15] you don't understand what my family's
[1:07:16] been through but how would he deal with
[1:07:18] the seed unfairly
[1:07:19] he can't do it he won't do it
[1:07:23] amen he always deals with the seed
[1:07:27] fairly he always chastises his children
[1:07:31] fairly
[1:07:31] he always corrects them fairly amen
[1:07:35] so if i realize if i have that
[1:07:37] revelation that i am the seed if i can
[1:07:38] see my name in the book
[1:07:40] then i know that whatever he does is
[1:07:43] good
[1:07:47] now
[1:07:50] so he says that's what the holy spirit
[1:07:52] has been doing
[1:07:53] see he goes and inspects he goes
[1:07:56] and he inspects he said that's the
[1:07:59] reason you can't have these things and
[1:08:00] you say i spoke in tongues and i shouted
[1:08:02] i danced in the spirit he said that i
[1:08:04] don't have nothing to do with it
[1:08:06] see the holy spirit inspects that person
[1:08:10] until he's thoroughly satisfied and
[1:08:13] knows that they
[1:08:14] are he said then they are sealed unto
[1:08:17] their eternal destination
[1:08:20] there is not nothing can ever break that
[1:08:23] seal
[1:08:25] hallelujah there is not nothing can ever
[1:08:28] break that seal in quotes ephesians 4
[1:08:30] 30.
[1:08:31] you're still to the day of your
[1:08:32] redemption he said hold that word
[1:08:34] redemption you're sealed until the day
[1:08:37] after redemption
[1:08:38] hold that word redemption he said see
[1:08:40] until
[1:08:42] amen until the day that the book of
[1:08:45] redemption is the next quote
[1:08:48] has been revealed and the redeemer comes
[1:08:52] to claim
[1:08:53] his possession hallelujah
[1:08:57] he's sealed until the day what's been
[1:08:59] going on
[1:09:01] that's that's what's happening church
[1:09:04] like i said how can you miss a rapture
[1:09:05] you're already a part of
[1:09:07] how can you how can you leave a message
[1:09:10] that is you
[1:09:15] right how could you ever do that how
[1:09:18] could you ever miss that
[1:09:20] so now he says until the day that the
[1:09:23] book of redemption has been revealed and
[1:09:25] the redeemer comes to claim his
[1:09:26] possession nothing can do it see
[1:09:27] don't grieve it he said stay he said do
[1:09:31] things that pleases god. for the book is
[1:09:34] sealed
[1:09:37] the book is sealed now and you are
[1:09:38] sealed
[1:09:40] amen he said the holy spirit itself is
[1:09:43] to steal so you do things
[1:09:44] that's pleasing to god because you're
[1:09:48] you have been sealed by god now
[1:09:51] he says seal signifies he said now this
[1:09:54] is words i got from the dictionary
[1:09:56] he said seal signifies the finished work
[1:09:59] are you still with me tonight
[1:10:01] still hanging with me still soon finds
[1:10:04] that finished work what's he doing he's
[1:10:06] he's inspecting to see if you've done
[1:10:08] what you were told to do
[1:10:12] i've got told something the other day
[1:10:14] monday that really really blessed me
[1:10:18] it's because a man called and he was
[1:10:20] very encouraging hear from the church
[1:10:22] and
[1:10:23] he called me and told me he said brother
[1:10:24] ben he said you told me to do something
[1:10:27] he said and i took it to heart and i did
[1:10:30] it
[1:10:31] and it worked and it wasn't anything
[1:10:34] major it was just something that i had
[1:10:36] been through something and i said
[1:10:37] i think it'll help if you do this
[1:10:40] he said i did it and it worked and the
[1:10:43] situation just broke open
[1:10:46] and somebody who was hard against the
[1:10:48] gospel started
[1:10:50] accepting things about the gospel and
[1:10:53] and and being becoming friendly with
[1:10:55] their family again and things like that
[1:10:57] but see that's just me as a pastor but
[1:10:59] can you imagine how much
[1:11:00] more if we would just do what god says
[1:11:05] if we could just take god's word for it
[1:11:09] it just blessed me he said i took it to
[1:11:10] heart and i did it and it worked
[1:11:14] what if we could do that with every word
[1:11:15] of god i took it to heart and i did it
[1:11:18] and it worked
[1:11:20] amen hallelujah
[1:11:24] amen and he says seal signifies he said
[1:11:28] a finished work and when the seventh
[1:11:29] seal is broken and i underline that
[1:11:31] because
[1:11:33] it has to be broken for the seals to be
[1:11:34] open right when the seventh seal is
[1:11:37] broken the mystery of god that's sealed
[1:11:39] in these mysterious seals it's finished
[1:11:42] until the day that seal is broke
[1:11:44] and then it's revealed what's on the
[1:11:45] inside of it
[1:11:47] he said if the man is wondering what's
[1:11:50] in that boxcar
[1:11:52] said there's supposed to be such and
[1:11:53] such they're supposed to be
[1:11:55] he's presuming amen
[1:11:59] he's presuming but when the seal is
[1:12:02] broken
[1:12:03] and the door is open we see into it then
[1:12:06] and see exactly what's in there
[1:12:10] hallelujah when the seal is broken the
[1:12:13] door is open we see into it there to see
[1:12:15] exactly what's in there he said you see
[1:12:16] it
[1:12:17] he said and that will only be done at
[1:12:20] the end time
[1:12:22] what a marvelous day to live in
[1:12:26] he said another thing and i'll just
[1:12:27] continue for just a few more minutes and
[1:12:28] we'll close but he said another thing a
[1:12:30] seal signifies this ownership
[1:12:32] see the seal has a mark on it shows
[1:12:34] ownership
[1:12:36] when you are bought by the blood of
[1:12:37] jesus christ and sealed by the holy
[1:12:39] ghost
[1:12:40] you no longer belong to the world or
[1:12:42] anything pertaining to the world
[1:12:45] you are owned by god
[1:12:48] hallelujah amen and he says
[1:12:51] he says another thing is a seal this is
[1:12:53] security seal means you're secured he
[1:12:55] said now you that don't believe in
[1:12:57] eternal security i don't know
[1:12:59] he said but now a seal signifies
[1:13:01] security
[1:13:02] to its destination woe unto that guy
[1:13:06] he said they would try to break that
[1:13:07] seal and the holy spirit still cannot be
[1:13:10] broken
[1:13:12] he said you have all heard me say and
[1:13:14] then brother iran was going to deal with
[1:13:15] this and i want to again
[1:13:17] dig into this statement because i think
[1:13:19] it's important he said you've all heard
[1:13:20] me say that people said the devil made
[1:13:22] me do this
[1:13:23] he said no the devil didn't do it he
[1:13:25] just wasn't sealed in
[1:13:27] because when you're sealed in he's
[1:13:28] sealed out
[1:13:31] he said see he said no you went out to
[1:13:32] him he couldn't get into you
[1:13:35] because the only way to get into you is
[1:13:37] to come to the same process you have
[1:13:38] you'd have to be saved
[1:13:40] sanctified filled with the holy ghost
[1:13:42] then he'd be your brother
[1:13:45] so you see so he didn't do it no he said
[1:13:48] you just went to the borderline and come
[1:13:50] back
[1:13:51] lusting for the things of the world you
[1:13:53] never went all the way over into canaan
[1:13:55] you see across
[1:13:55] jordan the death to self and so this
[1:13:58] brought another question another thing
[1:14:00] that i've dealt with and
[1:14:01] i guess i've had to broaden my
[1:14:03] understanding over the years myself
[1:14:05] about this is can you backslide after
[1:14:08] you have the seal of the holy ghost
[1:14:11] i had somebody from a local church when
[1:14:14] i was pastoring at bransville
[1:14:16] not not here in hardy but nearby
[1:14:19] that had come and talked to me someone
[1:14:21] from my church would come and talk to me
[1:14:22] they said well i talked to this brother
[1:14:24] and he said that if i was sealed with
[1:14:27] the holy ghost
[1:14:29] that i could go up to the swimming pool
[1:14:32] and stare at the
[1:14:33] look at the at the ladies in the
[1:14:35] swimming pool and it wouldn't bother me
[1:14:37] i said well i guess he's more sealed
[1:14:39] than i am
[1:14:43] and the truth is he's more sealed than
[1:14:44] brother branham was
[1:14:47] can you backslide after you have to seal
[1:14:49] the holy ghost this is what brother
[1:14:50] branham says in the token
[1:14:51] he said here friends he said if you ever
[1:14:53] was healed if you live long enough
[1:14:54] you're going to get sick again
[1:14:56] but if you one time take that token
[1:14:57] you've had it forever
[1:14:59] he said grieve not the holy spirit of
[1:15:01] god whereby you're sealed to the day of
[1:15:02] your redemption not to the next revival
[1:15:04] he said he wasn't sealed you got
[1:15:06] emotionally worked up
[1:15:08] but you are dead and your life is hidden
[1:15:09] in god through christ you're sealed by
[1:15:10] the holy ghost
[1:15:11] he said if you are once baptized into
[1:15:14] that holy spirit
[1:15:15] he said now you can backslide
[1:15:18] that is true but you can't get away from
[1:15:20] that seal
[1:15:23] you're sealed into it now watching again
[1:15:26] i'm not going to deal with much more in
[1:15:28] the breach so just hang with me just a
[1:15:29] moment
[1:15:30] he said see temporarily minor every one
[1:15:33] of us
[1:15:34] backside many times a day
[1:15:38] then who ought to be at the altar
[1:15:43] right is it just the person who oh you
[1:15:46] say well
[1:15:46] i don't have to repent i'm a christian
[1:15:48] i'm sealed well you still live in the
[1:15:50] flesh
[1:15:52] and the prophet of god say you each one
[1:15:54] of us backside many times a day
[1:15:57] he said we're all guilty every one of us
[1:15:58] there's none of us perfected
[1:16:00] and as long as we're in this body he
[1:16:01] said we are still no matter how much the
[1:16:03] people try to tell
[1:16:04] i've got sanctified i can kiss this
[1:16:06] woman or do that he's lying
[1:16:09] he cannot
[1:16:12] i can't put that any more forcefully to
[1:16:15] you than what we have but you can't do
[1:16:16] it
[1:16:18] right you will but she's a good
[1:16:20] christian i'm a good christian we'll
[1:16:21] just write we'll just do these things
[1:16:23] together and we'll be okay no you won't
[1:16:26] you can't do it so the prophet of god
[1:16:28] said
[1:16:30] he said he said i don't try to say lord
[1:16:33] let me see how close
[1:16:34] i can go this lord keep me as far away
[1:16:36] as i can get
[1:16:39] see just stay as far away said remember
[1:16:41] you're still human being
[1:16:43] he said but now if you make a mistake
[1:16:44] and do something wrong he said you don't
[1:16:46] willfully if you're a christian if
[1:16:47] you're a born-again christian you don't
[1:16:49] mean to do wrong
[1:16:50] your intentions and everything is right
[1:16:53] he said but if you do and he's answering
[1:16:55] a question here
[1:16:56] he said if you do as she said he said
[1:16:59] make a mistake and do something wrong he
[1:17:01] said well let god
[1:17:04] will god just let you just go on and on
[1:17:06] and die like that and be lost
[1:17:08] or will he bring you back to
[1:17:09] reconciliation
[1:17:11] he said he will bring you back i want
[1:17:14] you glad
[1:17:15] for the tender hand of jehovah he will
[1:17:18] bring you back
[1:17:19] hallelujah that's right he will bring
[1:17:22] you back
[1:17:23] he said and then if you do anything
[1:17:24] wrong he said if
[1:17:26] it don't condemn you and you go on like
[1:17:28] that on out remember
[1:17:29] he wasn't saved at the beginning he
[1:17:32] wasn't saved you just had to make
[1:17:33] believe he wasn't saved
[1:17:34] but when you when you're saved you have
[1:17:37] a different spirit
[1:17:38] you're a different nature you're a new
[1:17:41] creature in christ
[1:17:42] and the old things has passed away and
[1:17:45] they are dead and buried
[1:17:46] in the sea of forgetfulness he said and
[1:17:50] but being you're living here in this
[1:17:52] world here
[1:17:54] there's traps set for you everywhere
[1:18:00] i've learned not to be surprised by
[1:18:02] anything because there's traps
[1:18:04] set for you everywhere you think satan
[1:18:07] gave up on trying to get me to do
[1:18:09] something wrong
[1:18:10] you think he's given up on you you might
[1:18:12] be 70 80 90.
[1:18:13] it doesn't matter how many years you've
[1:18:14] been a christian he's not giving up on
[1:18:16] laying traps for you
[1:18:17] he's got traps everywhere we live in an
[1:18:20] age when everything's a trap even the
[1:18:22] device that you carry
[1:18:23] the phone everything that you've got is
[1:18:25] a trap
[1:18:26] everything is a trap he's got them all
[1:18:29] over
[1:18:30] but you're a new creature in christ amen
[1:18:34] hallelujah he's got traps for you
[1:18:36] everywhere but you're a new creature in
[1:18:38] christ he said you're walking
[1:18:39] with your eyes on christ
[1:18:43] see because if you put your eyes on a
[1:18:44] preacher the preacher might fall
[1:18:46] you put your eyes on a church the church
[1:18:48] might might fail you
[1:18:49] you put your eyes on mom and dad they
[1:18:51] might fail you you put your eyes on
[1:18:53] somebody else they might fail you but if
[1:18:54] you could ever get your eyes on christ
[1:18:57] if you could ever get them off the
[1:18:58] preacher and off of mom and dad and off
[1:18:59] the church in real life
[1:19:00] they're just human but i serve a perfect
[1:19:03] god
[1:19:04] i've served the one who was sealed by
[1:19:06] his father he said
[1:19:07] he said this is my beloved son he said
[1:19:09] behold the lamb of god
[1:19:11] who takes away the sins of the world i
[1:19:13] served the one who walked out that day
[1:19:15] and grabbed hold of the book when no man
[1:19:17] was found worthy i serve that man i can
[1:19:20] keep my eyes on him and i can be a new
[1:19:22] creature in christ i'm walking with my
[1:19:24] eyes on christ
[1:19:26] he said and remember that when you make
[1:19:28] a mistake
[1:19:29] a real christian will always come back
[1:19:32] quickly
[1:19:34] for reconciliation quickly
[1:19:38] you can't live that way it's an
[1:19:41] impossibility
[1:19:42] you understand he just can't he's not
[1:19:44] built for it he'd go crazy like that i
[1:19:51] got a picture of noah's dove returning
[1:19:53] to the ark because that's where brother
[1:19:54] branham takes this and i won't read it
[1:19:55] all
[1:19:56] my brother brown takes this to noah's
[1:19:58] dove and he's there and he sends out a
[1:20:00] crow
[1:20:01] and the crow can just go wherever he
[1:20:03] wants he's perfectly happy sitting on an
[1:20:06] old
[1:20:06] rotten carcass
[1:20:09] sitting in a you name the kind of church
[1:20:13] and ever nobody changes he's happy with
[1:20:15] that
[1:20:17] everybody just remains in their deadness
[1:20:19] and their and their
[1:20:21] uh petrifying flesh the sense of it it's
[1:20:24] fine with him
[1:20:25] he's perfectly happy living like that
[1:20:28] living a double life living
[1:20:29] one way and saying he's something else
[1:20:31] he's perfectly happy but the dove
[1:20:34] flew out and couldn't find a place
[1:20:39] that she was comfortable with
[1:20:43] she still flew out and sometimes you'll
[1:20:45] fly out sometimes
[1:20:47] you'll go you'll fall into a trap you'll
[1:20:49] do something you shouldn't do
[1:20:50] but you're just not you can't live there
[1:20:53] and no matter if it's embarrassing no
[1:20:55] matter what it is you say lord
[1:20:57] i've got to come back i've got to get
[1:21:00] back in the ark i know
[1:21:02] i lost my temper i messed up i i did
[1:21:05] wrong with my children i had
[1:21:06] i did something i shouldn't have done i
[1:21:08] i messed up lord i didn't follow your
[1:21:10] leading
[1:21:11] but i want to come back lord and i don't
[1:21:13] care how embarrassing it is who i have
[1:21:15] to apologize to
[1:21:16] what i have to do to come back i want to
[1:21:19] come back to the ark
[1:21:20] it's the only place that i find safety
[1:21:25] amen you will come back
[1:21:28] and brother branham says again in the
[1:21:30] breach he said now notice
[1:21:31] this book is sealed and you are sealed
[1:21:34] with the book
[1:21:35] until the day of redemption we're here
[1:21:41] and we're beginning to find out what was
[1:21:44] written on the inside
[1:21:48] very bad i think that's why this means
[1:21:50] so much to us
[1:21:52] sometimes i just take some of the
[1:21:53] message like this and read maybe 15
[1:21:56] or 20 paragraphs of a sermon of brother
[1:21:58] branham's and you just take that and
[1:22:00] and it just opens up to you it opens up
[1:22:02] to you why it's the hour we live in
[1:22:04] it's not the preacher that's the hour
[1:22:06] that we live in we live in that hour
[1:22:08] when these things are being opened we
[1:22:09] live in that time when we can fly like
[1:22:12] eagles
[1:22:13] this is the claiming time and the same
[1:22:16] message that opened the book and
[1:22:18] revealed the thunders
[1:22:19] the same message that revealed telled us
[1:22:22] about serpent seed and
[1:22:23] marriage and divorce and all the
[1:22:25] mysteries that brother branham talked
[1:22:26] about that were revealed the same
[1:22:28] the same one who told us about a white
[1:22:30] horse and a black horse and a red horse
[1:22:32] is telling us today who we are
[1:22:36] not by coming up with some other message
[1:22:38] but by looking at that same message
[1:22:44] and brother branham later on and we'll
[1:22:45] get to it maybe if the lord permits in
[1:22:47] the some coming time
[1:22:50] john began to rejoice because he could
[1:22:53] look but the brother said he looked past
[1:22:54] the curtain of time
[1:22:56] and saw john
[1:22:59] do you know what it meant to be able to
[1:23:02] look past the curtain of time
[1:23:04] and see john john been through some
[1:23:05] things he'd been thrown on the isle of
[1:23:07] patmos
[1:23:08] he didn't know if god was for him or
[1:23:10] against him some of the time
[1:23:11] because here he'd been through they
[1:23:13] tried to boil him in oil and couldn't
[1:23:14] get couldn't kill him
[1:23:15] so they threw him out with the serpents
[1:23:16] and the scorpions and everything else
[1:23:18] but john saw john
[1:23:22] beyond the curtain of time hallelujah
[1:23:25] and if john saw himself beyond the
[1:23:28] curtain of time once he saw it he
[1:23:29] couldn't unsee it
[1:23:31] no matter what happened to john from
[1:23:32] then on john could say
[1:23:34] i saw it amen i was there no wonder he
[1:23:37] rejoiced
[1:23:38] no wonder he cried out why this is the
[1:23:40] hour when the book is over the seal is
[1:23:43] open
[1:23:44] he made it john could leave there and
[1:23:47] say
[1:23:49] i've already made it
[1:23:52] hallelujah amen i've already made it
[1:23:57] amen the battle is over
[1:24:01] amen the victory's been won
[1:24:04] it's already done very bad
[1:24:08] you believe it tonight i've already made
[1:24:11] it he said i saw myself past the curtain
[1:24:13] of time
[1:24:14] would you bow your heads with me tonight
[1:24:16] can you see yourself beyond the curtain
[1:24:18] of time
[1:24:21] have you looked at the word can you see
[1:24:23] he saw
[1:24:24] john can you see the book's been open
[1:24:26] can you see that's me
[1:24:29] once you see yourself there no trial
[1:24:31] will ever throw you off of it
[1:24:33] no tribulation of life though it may you
[1:24:36] may be tested because that's what the
[1:24:38] inspector does
[1:24:39] he tests you he tries you he lets you go
[1:24:42] through some things but you can't be
[1:24:44] thrown off
[1:24:45] what you've seen once john saw john
[1:24:49] beyond the curtain of time that shielded
[1:24:52] that was it
[1:24:53] he could rejoice he could he could
[1:24:56] come into that what brother adam called
[1:24:58] king lamb worship time
[1:25:00] he could worship like never before
[1:25:02] because he knew
[1:25:04] that sin wasn't there anymore all that
[1:25:06] he was had been washed away the lamb had
[1:25:08] taken the book
[1:25:09] and john had seen john can you see your
[1:25:13] name there today

[1:25:21] word maybe we've let
[1:25:23] little ideas that we have or something

[1:26:00] kind of gotten that vision of scared
[1:26:02] just
[1:26:02] life has done it they've been walking
[1:26:05] through life and it's been hard and
[1:26:07] they realize that they're just human
[1:26:09] they've made mistakes
[1:26:10] back said maybe many times today
[1:26:13] they made many mistakes then they go to
[1:26:16] you and they begin to cry and say lord
[1:26:18] would you forgive me
[1:26:20] you say what sin help them to realize
[1:26:23] lord

[1:27:42] believe that it's mine
[1:27:44] i pray you'd grant it tonight help us to
[1:27:47] realize that father our worship would be
[1:27:48] so much more
[1:27:50] if we weren't worshiping through the
[1:27:52] veil
[1:27:53] of our own mistakes but if we could ever
[1:27:56] give
[1:27:56] us push that veil aside
[1:28:00] realize that we can worship you here as
[1:28:02] if we were already there
[1:28:04] because we're not worshiping you through
[1:28:05] a veil of mistakes we're not worshiping
[1:28:08] you based on how good we are
[1:28:10] but we're worshiping based on what you

[1:28:17] beyond the curtain of time lord we can
[1:28:20] begin to see that you

[1:28:37] lord as you've been moving my heart
[1:28:39] towards prayer today
[1:28:40] i pray god that each one of our hearts
[1:28:42] would just be stirred in that direction
[1:28:45] lord that we could just begin to pray or
[1:28:48] not because we're far from you but the
[1:28:50] closer we get to you
[1:28:51] as we said sunday the more the closest
[1:28:55] one to you
[1:28:56] christ himself he was on earth
[1:29:00] never did anything wrong the most

[1:29:08] oh god
[1:29:09] would you stir us to that lord help us
[1:29:12] to pray
[1:29:13] lord not because we think that our
