[23:56] ahead and make their way forward, we
[23:59] have just a few requests this morning.
[24:01] And also uh just remember there's two
[24:03] services today and also be in prayer for
[24:06] our pastor. Uh he's dealing with pretty
[24:08] bad toothaches and stuff and he's going
[24:10] in to have dental surgery tomorrow. So
[24:12] just remember him in prayer. And also uh
[24:15] for an announcement uh in between
[24:18] services on September the 21st, there
[24:19] will be a baby shower for Sister
[24:21] Katherine. Um if you need to know gift
[24:24] ideas or or anything like that, get with
[24:26] my wife. She she has all the details on
[24:28] that. And also u
[24:32] brother Bill's niece, I believe it is
[24:35] Bill's niece, uh Donna Rainwater asked
[24:37] for prayers. She isn't feeling well this
[24:39] morning. So just remember her in prayer.
[24:41] Also, brother Bill told me this morning
[24:43] that he'd had a rough night, but uh he's
[24:45] here this morning. So, we're just
[24:46] believing that the Lord's going to take
[24:47] care of that. And brother Paul actually
[24:49] told me in the foyer coming in that he
[24:51] went to see the doctor and and uh I
[24:54] guess he had a pacemaker. It wasn't
[24:55] working or something and and he said
[24:57] they checked him out and his heart was
[24:58] beating all on its own. So, we thank the
[25:00] Lord for brother for the healing for
[25:02] brother Paul.
[25:05] Man, that's always always good to have a
[25:06] good testimony, brother Paul. And if I
[25:08] got them details wrong, talk to him.
[25:10] He's always got a good testimony for
[25:11] you, brother Paul does, and we
[25:13] appreciate his faith. Amen. If we could,
[25:16] Brother Jared, why don't you uh take
[25:18] these needs to the Lord this morning,
[25:20] buddy? If you have a need on your heart,
[25:22] it's good to have Sister Emily back with
[25:23] us this morning. I know the devil's been
[25:25] fighting her. Good to have you back,
[25:26] sis. Amen. Just if you have a need on
[25:28] your heart, just make it known by an
[25:29] uplifted hand as Brother Jared takes
[25:30] these knees to the Lord.

[25:53] single one of our needs, Lord. And we

[38:27] the Lord's done for us? Amen. You know,
[38:31] the devil, the devil likes to fight his
[38:33] children. Amen. But we know who we are.
[38:36] &gt;&gt; And if he's fighting you, that means he
[38:38] don't have you. So let the devil keep
[38:40] fighting and we're going to keep winning
[38:41] and overcoming. Somebody say, "Amen."
[38:43] &gt;&gt; Give the Lord another hand clap of
[38:45] praise this morning.
[38:50] This this song here, I I don't think we
[38:52] sing the verses to it very much, but but
[38:54] I want to uh I want to try to sing the
[38:56] verses to this one this morning. I love
[38:58] the verses to this song. And we're going
[39:00] to sing, we'll sing the chorus first and
[39:01] then we'll go right into the verses with
[39:03] all your hearts now.
[39:06] Fill my cup,
[39:09] Lord.
[39:12] I lift it up,
[39:17] Lord.
[39:19] [Music]
[39:20] Oh, come and quench
[39:26] this thirsting
[39:29] of
[39:30] my soul.
[39:35] Oh bread
[39:38] of heaven,
[39:42] won't you feed me till
[39:46] I want

[39:50] more?

[40:27] that could not satisfy.
[40:36] You ever been there?
[40:38] Oh, but then
[40:42] [Music]
[40:43] I heard
[40:45] my savior
[40:48] speaking.
[40:52] Draw from my well
[40:58] that never
[41:00] shall
[41:02] run dry.
[41:05] Can you sing it like this? Oh, Phil.
[41:09] Oh, how many needs are refilling here
[41:11] this morning?
[41:14] I lift it up,
[41:19] Lord.
[41:22] Oh, come and quench
[41:28] this thirsting
[41:30] of my soul.
[41:37] Oh, bread
[41:39] of heaven.

[41:53] Fill my cup.
[41:57] Fill
[41:58] it up
[42:00] and make me whole.
[42:07] Oh, there
[42:10] are millions in
[42:13] this world who
[42:17] are seeking
[42:24] for pleasures.
[42:29] Earthly
[42:30] goods
[42:32] can afford.
[42:34] But I like this part here.
[42:38] Oh, but none
[42:43] can match the oneous
[42:48] treasures
[42:53] that
[42:54] I find
[42:58] in Jesus
[43:00] Christ my Lord.
[43:04] Here's my cup, Lord, with all your
[43:06] hearts now. Oh, here's my cup,
[43:12] Lord.
[43:14] I lift it up,
[43:19] Lord.
[43:22] Oh, come and quench
[43:28] this thirsting
[43:31] of
[43:32] my soul.
[43:37] Oh bread
[43:40] of heaven,
[43:43] won't you feed
[43:45] me till
[43:47] I want
[43:49] no
[43:51] more?
[43:53] Here's my cup.
[43:57] Fill
[43:58] it up and make me. One more time with
[44:04] all your hearts now as our pastor comes.
[44:07] Oh, here's
[44:10] my cup.
[44:12] Oh, if you need a filling this morning,
[44:13] would you just put your hands up to him?

[44:19] Lord.
[44:21] Oh, come and quench this morning. Come
[44:25] and

[44:33] &gt;&gt; my soul my soul.
[44:37] Oh bread of heaven.

[44:54] Here's my cup.
[44:58] Oh, fill it up and may be whole. One

[45:17] Lord. I lift it up,
[45:21] Lord.
[45:23] Oh, won't you come and quench
[45:29] this deep thirsting
[45:32] of
[45:34] my soul?
[45:38] Oh bread of heaven,
[45:45] won't you feed me till
[45:49] I want
[45:51] no
[45:53] more?
[45:55] Here's my cup.
[45:59] Fill it up and make me
[46:06] whole.
[46:08] Let's bow our heads together for a word
[46:10] of prayer. Heavenly Father, we've got
[46:12] our cups right side up this morning.
[46:15] Lord, we want to be made well, made
[46:17] whole. Lord, there's many broken places,
[46:20] I believe, in every one of our hearts
[46:22] and every one of our lives, but Lord,
[46:24] you're healing us. We're so thankful for
[46:26] that. We thank you for that promise,
[46:29] Lord, of complete healing. One day,
[46:31] Father, when our bodies are made new
[46:34] again, we step into another dimension.
[46:37] Thank you for that, Lord. I pray that
[46:39] you would just continue to heal us this
[46:41] morning. Touch every heart, Lord, every
[46:44] every spirit, every soul, every every
[46:47] body, Lord, that may be sick or in need.
[46:50] God, I I don't know how to do it, but I
[46:52] know that you can. And I pray that you
[46:54] would move me out of the way. Diminish
[46:57] me, Lord, so that you might be
[46:58] magnified. I pray you do it this
[47:01] morning. We pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[47:05] Amen.
[47:07] Thank the Lord.
[47:10] Thank the Lord.
[47:14] Going to read from Numbers chapter 17
[47:16] and verse 8. Numbers 17 and 8.
[47:22] As we continue to talk about the temple,
[47:23] we're going to go back this morning and
[47:25] talk about Aaron's rod. Spend a little
[47:28] time on that.
[47:29] Numbers chapter 17
[47:33] and verse 8.
[47:36] And it came to pass that on the marorrow
[47:39] Moses went into the tabernacle of
[47:41] witness. And behold, the rod of Aaron
[47:44] for the house of Levi was budded and
[47:46] brought forth buds and bloomed blossoms
[47:49] and yielded almonds. I pray the Lord
[47:52] would add his blessing to the reading of
[47:53] the word. You may be seated this
[47:56] morning. Good to have each and every one
[47:57] of you in the house of the Lord. Good to
[47:59] see our visitors today. God bless you.
[48:01] Thank you for being here. And each one
[48:03] of you that are here in the house of the
[48:05] Lord. We believe that that everything
[48:08] can be changed, lives can be changed,
[48:10] and our hearts can be changed in the
[48:12] house of the Lord. Brother Brandham said
[48:13] we either come in uh or we leave better
[48:16] or worse than when we come in. So, how
[48:18] many want to leave better today? That's
[48:20] what we want to do. So, let's just get
[48:22] right into the word of God because
[48:23] that's what does the changing. Uh the
[48:26] the uh rod of Aaron was one of the three
[48:29] original items in the ark. And and it
[48:33] was it's known as Aaron's rod that
[48:35] budded because there were other rods
[48:37] that were placed also in the presence of
[48:39] the shikina that did not bud. So, we
[48:42] know that Aaron's rod was not some
[48:45] random item kept in the ark of the
[48:47] covenant. It wasn't like uh Moses just
[48:50] walked up there and said, "Aaron, why
[48:51] don't you throw your rod in there and
[48:53] see what happens to it?" That that's not
[48:55] the way it happened at all. But it was
[48:57] actually by election. It was placed
[49:00] there on purpose. It was actually a
[49:02] vindication of the ironic priesthood
[49:05] that this was something that said that
[49:07] this is what God was going to use. This
[49:10] is who God was going to use. I would say
[49:13] this morning that you are not in the
[49:14] presence of God by accident this
[49:17] morning. You were placed here. There was
[49:19] a a conspiracy if you will of that God
[49:23] had before time to place you here in
[49:26] this place in this time in your body
[49:29] with the ability to listen and the
[49:31] ability to hear and the ability uh to
[49:34] respond to the word. He put you here for
[49:36] a reason this morning. And and so we
[49:39] need to know what that is. Now uh
[49:41] numbers 16 tells us kind of the the
[49:44] background and the priest story of uh of
[49:48] this uh rod and why it was there. It
[49:50] tells the story of Kora, a man named
[49:53] Kora, a man named Dayathan, a man named
[49:55] Abram, also a man named Anne. And those
[49:59] men are are mentioned in Numbers chapter
[50:01] 16 and verse one. Kora the son of Ishar,
[50:04] the son of Kath, the son of Levi. And
[50:07] then Dayan and Abram the sons of Eliab
[50:09] and Anne, the son of Pelith, sons of
[50:12] Reuben, took men. So they had other men
[50:14] with them. And they rose up before Moses
[50:17] with certain of the children of Israel,
[50:19] 250 princes of the assembly, famous in
[50:23] the congregation, men of renown. So they
[50:26] didn't come on their own, but this was a
[50:28] genuine movement uh that they had gotten
[50:31] other men on their side to come and and
[50:33] bring this to Moses and to Aaron. Now,
[50:36] we we know that Kora was actually Moses
[50:39] and Aaron's first cousin. So, it was not
[50:42] somebody that wouldn't have known them.
[50:44] It was somebody that grew up with them,
[50:46] that would have been very close to them,
[50:49] especially under the family structure
[50:51] that the Israelites moved under. And his
[50:53] family was actually called to service.
[50:56] They were called to be a part of the
[50:59] priesthood in the sense of they were to
[51:01] they were called to serve around the
[51:03] ark. They were called to serve the
[51:05] tabernacle. They were called actually to
[51:07] carry the ark on their shoulders. They
[51:10] were called to uh sing in in the
[51:12] sanctuary. They were called to do those
[51:14] things, but they were not called to the
[51:16] holy things. So, they were not to come
[51:18] into the holy of holies or to touch
[51:20] those things. And so, it was when the
[51:22] ark moved, it was actually covered by
[51:25] the sons of Aaron before it was moved.
[51:28] The holy of holies was never to be seen.
[51:30] The ark was never to actually be seen,
[51:33] but it was covered with badger skins and
[51:35] was not to be touched by anyone else
[51:38] except the son of Aaron. So, you can
[51:39] imagine how that must have felt to to
[51:42] Kora and his family that they walked up
[51:45] there and said, "Well, aren't we as holy
[51:47] as you are? Are we able like these other
[51:49] men are to touch these things?" And yet
[51:52] God had made a choice. And when God
[51:54] makes a choice, we ought to accept that
[51:57] choice that God makes. So Kora uh you
[52:01] know he comes before him for that
[52:02] reason. We find that Kora's family they
[52:04] did have a job. They did have a purpose
[52:06] but it wasn't to serve in the holy
[52:09] things. Numbers chapter 4 and verse 15.
[52:11] When Aaron had his sons have made an end
[52:13] of covering the sanctuary and all the
[52:15] vessels of the sanctuary as the campus
[52:17] is set forward. After that the sons of
[52:20] Kohath shall come to bear it but they
[52:22] shall not touch any holy thing lest they
[52:24] die. So all of the So here was Moses and
[52:28] Aaron and here was Aaron's family was to
[52:31] be the priest and anybody else was was
[52:34] to serve but not to touch right not to
[52:37] view it not to touch it but just to
[52:39] serve in it. So he said they shall not
[52:41] touch any holy thing lest they die.
[52:43] These things are the burden of the sons
[52:45] of Kohath in the tabernacle of the
[52:47] congregation. So they had a job an
[52:49] important job to do but it wouldn't be
[52:51] with the holy things. Now they were to
[52:53] be burdenbearers and this service was to
[52:56] continue. In Numbers 4:17, the Lord
[52:59] spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,
[53:01] "Cut ye not off the tribe of the
[53:03] families of the Kathites from among the
[53:05] Levites, but thus do unto them that they
[53:09] may live." So in other words, make it
[53:11] where they they are not uh going into
[53:14] the Holy of Holies to be subject to
[53:16] death by touching something that they
[53:18] shouldn't touch. But but he said this,
[53:20] "Do this to them. When they approach
[53:22] under the most holy things, Aaron and
[53:23] his sons shall go in and appoint them
[53:26] everyone to his service and to his
[53:29] burden." So what had to happen is when
[53:31] they would come in to the sanctuary, a
[53:34] son of Aaron or Aaron himself had to
[53:36] stand there and say, "Now you pick this
[53:38] up and you pick this up and you put you
[53:41] bear this burden and you roll this up."
[53:44] And so they become like a management
[53:46] over the the Korites and the Kathites.
[53:48] And so he said, "But they shall not go
[53:51] in to see when the holy things are
[53:53] covered, lest they die." Now, if you're
[53:56] just thinking carnally and you're
[53:58] sitting back and you're looking and say,
[53:59] "Well, I've known Moses ever since he
[54:01] was a little baby and got and got put in
[54:03] the river. I've known uh I've known
[54:05] Aaron all of his life. I've known all
[54:07] these men. I know that they're just
[54:10] normal, natural men. I know that they're
[54:12] just a human like everybody else. And
[54:14] they're not the only ones that are holy.
[54:16] We came out just like everybody else
[54:18] did. So, we've got a right to do just
[54:21] like they do. And it must have looked
[54:23] like nepotism. It must have looked like
[54:24] Moses was just setting up his family to
[54:27] do everything. But it wasn't that at
[54:29] all. But God had chosen Aaron to do what
[54:32] he did. And God had chosen Moses to do
[54:35] what he did. Now, here's their complaint
[54:37] in number 16 and three. He said, "They
[54:39] gathered themselves together against
[54:41] Moses and against Aaron, and said unto
[54:43] them, you take too much upon you, seeing
[54:46] all the congregation are holy, every one
[54:47] of them, and the Lord is among them."
[54:49] Now, that's a true statement,
[54:52] &gt;&gt; right? It's a true statement. You take
[54:54] too much upon you. The Lord is among
[54:56] them. That that's true. The Lord was
[54:58] among the congregation. All the
[54:59] congregation was holy. But not all of
[55:01] them were called to do what Moses did.
[55:03] Not all of them were called to do what
[55:05] Aaron did.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; But it was a different calling. Yeah,
[55:07] &gt;&gt; they were right about that. But Moses
[55:09] did not choose himself. God chose Moses.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; And Moses was not just any prophet. He
[55:15] was a word prophet.
[55:16] &gt;&gt; Right?
[55:17] &gt;&gt; So, brother Brandon picks this up when
[55:18] he was in South Africa. He picks up this
[55:22] idea of being disputed with with a word
[55:24] prophet. So, Brother Brandham has men
[55:27] that go with him and they have an
[55:28] itinerary. And the Lord speaks to
[55:30] Brother Brandham and says, "Go to the
[55:31] natives."
[55:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[55:32] &gt;&gt; Right. Go to the natives. And these men
[55:35] uh were going to South Africa. And they
[55:37] said, "No, we're going to go to the
[55:38] white population, have these meetings
[55:40] here and there." And he said, "But the
[55:42] Lord told me to go to the natives."
[55:44] Yeah.
[55:44] &gt;&gt; Right. And the Lord told him even to go
[55:46] hunting among the natives, right? And it
[55:48] seemed like, "Well, brother Brandon, you
[55:50] just want to go hunting. You don't want
[55:51] to you don't want to preach." And they
[55:53] had a an itinerary all set out for him.
[55:55] But what they were doing was disputing
[55:57] with the word prophet. And brother
[55:58] Brandham makes that very clear that they
[56:00] that's what they were doing. And he said
[56:02] he said he said God they said God has
[56:04] also spoken to us and brother Brandham
[56:06] went with them but he said we nearly all
[56:07] died right because of that. So in in in
[56:11] Jude 11 see we find that Jude said woe
[56:15] unto them for they've gone in the way of
[56:16] Cain. So there were some folks in the
[56:18] New Testament who were doing the same
[56:19] thing that Kora did ran greedily after
[56:22] the error error of Balum for reward and
[56:24] perish in the gains of Kora. What was
[56:27] the the gains of Kora? again saying is
[56:30] antilogia. It's a contradiction,
[56:32] hostility, rebellion, and refers to
[56:36] rebellion or strife or contradiction.
[56:39] And and you know, I want to be careful
[56:41] with this because makes it sound like,
[56:43] well, you can't disagree with the
[56:44] pastor. Well, I'm not Moses,
[56:48] &gt;&gt; right? I I don't have that job. Thank
[56:50] God for that. I'm not a vindicated
[56:52] prophet. I'm just a pastor. I You can
[56:55] argue with me. In fact, you could argue
[56:56] with brother Brandham, right? You can
[56:58] argue with a preacher, but the problem
[57:00] comes when you dispute with the revealed
[57:02] word,
[57:04] &gt;&gt; right? That a prophet brings.
[57:06] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? You You can argue,
[57:09] but you can't argue with the word. You
[57:11] can dispute, but you can't dispute with
[57:13] a vindicated message.
[57:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[57:15] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? So, we we want to
[57:17] be careful now. If we're going to be a
[57:20] church that that that is living, and we
[57:22] need to be a church that's alive, we
[57:24] need to be a church that's bearing
[57:26] fruit. We need to be a church that that
[57:28] has the love of God among them and the
[57:29] power of God among them and and we want
[57:31] to see sinners saved. We want to see
[57:33] people come into the presence of God and
[57:35] be changed. If we want to be like that,
[57:37] then we've got to be in a place where
[57:39] the word of God is elevated where we
[57:41] will not stand against the word prophet.
[57:44] We will not stand against the revealed
[57:46] word of the hour. Even if we are
[57:48] spiritual men, if if if God brought it
[57:50] in our day for us to consume, we ought
[57:53] to consume it. If God brought it in our
[57:55] day for us to hear, we ought to hear it.
[57:59] &gt;&gt; So, so one man in a generation could do
[58:02] what Moses did. And Kora could not take
[58:06] that place.
[58:08] But but brother Brandham said talked
[58:10] about how Kora's pride wouldn't let him
[58:12] submit to Moses's place that he had. And
[58:15] so he tried to impersonate.
[58:18] &gt;&gt; They they were not satisfied with what
[58:20] Jehovah had provided. though he had
[58:23] provided great things for them. I
[58:24] believe he's provided great things for
[58:26] us. But are we satisfied this morning
[58:29] with what he's provided? Are you
[58:31] satisfied with the with the salvation
[58:32] he's given you? Are you satisfied with
[58:34] your healing? Are you satisfied with the
[58:37] with the message of the hour? If you if
[58:39] you are satisfied God can work with you,
[58:41] but if you become rebellious,
[58:44] there's a there's a penalty for that.
[58:46] Now, they they were not satisfied with
[58:48] what Jehovah had provided. They made a
[58:50] camp, brother Brandham said, of creeds
[58:52] and dogmas instead of the living word.
[58:54] And we know that Kora was a a
[58:57] businessman, brother Brandham called
[58:58] him, who denied the ministry of
[59:00] Ephesians 4:10. So he looks at it and
[59:03] says, "Well, Moses, you're not doing a
[59:05] very good job, and Aaron, you're not
[59:06] doing a very good job. We can do just as
[59:08] good a job."
[59:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; Right. Even though we're not called to
[59:12] the holy things.
[59:14] &gt;&gt; Right.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; Right. And brother Brandham picks up on
[59:16] that that there's a movement that's
[59:18] starting back in the 1960s and you can
[59:21] see the fruit of it today,
[59:24] &gt;&gt; right? Or the lack of fruit if you put
[59:26] it that way of the charismatic movement.
[59:29] And not to pick on those people, but it
[59:31] but it hasn't produced a fruit of the
[59:34] gospel, of godliness, of holiness.
[59:37] &gt;&gt; What does it produce? Nonsense. A
[59:39] caricature. The world laughing at them.
[59:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; Right. Gifts out of order. and and not
[59:46] just gifts out of order, but even a
[59:47] laughingtock even where you don't even
[59:49] people don't even reverence the gifts
[59:51] anymore. And brother Brandon said the
[59:52] reason why they wouldn't because they've
[59:53] seen so much out of order.
[59:55] &gt;&gt; Right.
[59:56] &gt;&gt; Right. People don't even reverence the
[59:57] spiritual gifts anymore. People don't
[59:58] reverence preaching anymore. And
[1:00:00] preachers, you know, used to be a
[1:00:01] preacher was a, you know, an honorable
[1:00:04] thing. Now you kind of you don't want to
[1:00:06] tell somebody you're a preacher because
[1:00:07] people suspect you're trying to steal
[1:00:08] money from them or or or do something
[1:00:11] terrible to them. Why? because it's a
[1:00:13] this movement has come on that it's all
[1:00:15] about the money and what businessmen
[1:00:17] invaded the pulpit who had no business
[1:00:19] touching the word of God
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; right and brother Brandon tells us that
[1:00:25] in the church age book he said all over
[1:00:26] the world in both Pentecostal and
[1:00:27] fundamental groups they're organizing
[1:00:29] the businessmen they've invaded the
[1:00:31] pulpit without a call from God they have
[1:00:34] styled themselves the fishers of men and
[1:00:36] the founders of a move of God and they
[1:00:38] say the gifted ministry of Ephesians
[1:00:40] 4:10 through13 that God gave the church
[1:00:43] has failed. So they are taking over.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; We hear things like that even around the
[1:00:47] message.
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; Here we are right in the midst of the
[1:00:50] fulfillment of prophecy.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; He said called the gain sayings of Kora
[1:00:55] and they don't even know that they have
[1:00:56] fulfilled it. They're blindly going on
[1:00:58] preaching experience for truth. So in
[1:01:01] other words, because I feel it or I say
[1:01:03] it or or whatever my truth is, that's
[1:01:06] what truth is. No, the truth is what God
[1:01:08] says. The truth is what the word says.
[1:01:10] God can't change his mind about his own
[1:01:13] word. Now look, he said they're blindly
[1:01:16] going on preaching experience for truth.
[1:01:17] May God have pity on them. May their
[1:01:19] eyes be open before it is too late. It's
[1:01:23] our prayer today that become that modern
[1:01:25] charismatic move. Yes, sir.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; That brother Brandham had a hand in in
[1:01:28] in in helping them and beginning that
[1:01:31] movement and he used it as an open door,
[1:01:33] a place where he could go and he could
[1:01:36] preach. But the businessmen began to
[1:01:38] invade the pulpit. Businessmen have
[1:01:39] their place. Thank God for businessmen.
[1:01:41] We need them. But let God called men do
[1:01:44] the preaching.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; Right. Numbers 16 and4 when they come
[1:01:48] against Moses is just a background. Now
[1:01:51] we get to what we want to say this
[1:01:52] morning. But it says when Moses heard
[1:01:55] it, he fell upon his face and he spake
[1:01:58] unto Corin unto all his company saying
[1:02:00] even tomorrow the Lord will show who are
[1:02:02] his.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; And who is holy will cause him to come
[1:02:06] near unto him. even him whom he hath
[1:02:08] chosen will he cause to come near unto
[1:02:10] him. And they gathered together before
[1:02:12] the tabernacle. And then in verse 20, it
[1:02:15] says, "The Lord spake unto Moses and
[1:02:16] unto Aaron, saying,"Separate yourselves
[1:02:18] from among this congregation, that I may
[1:02:20] consume them in a moment. And they fell
[1:02:23] upon their faces and said, "Oh God, the
[1:02:24] God of the spirits of all flesh, shall
[1:02:26] one man sin, with thou be wroth with all
[1:02:28] the congregation." So, so God told Moses
[1:02:31] to separate himself and the people from
[1:02:33] Corora, Dayathan, and Abram. In verse
[1:02:36] 28, Moses said, "Hereby shall you know
[1:02:38] that the Lord has sent me to do all
[1:02:39] these works, for I have not done them of
[1:02:41] my own mind."
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; If these men die the common death of all
[1:02:45] men, if they be visited after the
[1:02:47] visitation of all men, then the Lord
[1:02:48] hath not sent me. But if the Lord make a
[1:02:50] new thing, and the earth open their
[1:02:51] mouth, and swallow them up with all that
[1:02:54] pertainth unto them, they go down quick
[1:02:56] into the pit, then you shall understand
[1:02:58] that these men have provoked the Lord.
[1:02:59] And the Bible goes on to tell us that
[1:03:01] the ground actually opened up and
[1:03:03] swallowed up those men. Right.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; Listen to me, church. I'll say the same
[1:03:06] thing has happened in our day.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah. The same thing has happened when
[1:03:10] they stood against the message of the
[1:03:11] hour. What happened to those men? They
[1:03:14] were swallowed up by the earth.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; Swallowed up with worlds and swallowed
[1:03:18] up. They had a name that they lived, but
[1:03:20] they were dead.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; Swallowed up by materialistic things
[1:03:26] until the church doesn't even resemble a
[1:03:28] church anymore. It doesn't even resemble
[1:03:29] the bride of Christ.
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:03:31] the ground opened and swallowed them up.
[1:03:34] This is interesting. Just kind of a side
[1:03:37] note, but you know, Dayan and his family
[1:03:41] were killed and Abram and his family and
[1:03:44] Anne and his family.
[1:03:46] Kora was killed. But the Bible says in
[1:03:49] Numbers 26:11, "Notwithstanding, the
[1:03:51] children of Kora died not."
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; See, they had a job to do.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; They really had a purpose.
[1:04:01] actually had a purpose in the house of
[1:04:03] God,
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; if Kora had only seen that and stayed
[1:04:06] within his purpose, he'd have been fine,
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; but he tried to go outside of it.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; But if he could have just stayed within
[1:04:13] his calling,
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; he wouldn't have died,
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; but God actually saved his children.
[1:04:18] Because remember the scripture we read,
[1:04:19] cut not off the sons of the Kathites,
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; right? Cut not off the Korites because
[1:04:25] they they got a work to do. They got a
[1:04:26] job to do. In 2 Chronicles 20:19, you
[1:04:29] find there was a great victory.
[1:04:30] Remember, we talked about it before.
[1:04:32] There was a great victory during the
[1:04:33] reign, I believe it was of Hezekiah that
[1:04:35] it was during the or Jehoshaphat. It was
[1:04:37] during the reign of a king when they
[1:04:39] went down in there and they they
[1:04:40] worshiped and the enemy fell before
[1:04:42] them. When they worshiped, when they
[1:04:44] begin to sing and praise, the Bible said
[1:04:45] the Lord set up ambushments against
[1:04:48] these these enemies. And during that
[1:04:50] time, 2 Chronicles 20:19, the Levites,
[1:04:53] of the children of the Kathites, and of
[1:04:56] the children of the Korites.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; So even Kor's children stood up to
[1:05:00] praise the Lord God of Israel with a
[1:05:01] loud voice on high. Why they went back
[1:05:03] to their place,
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; And did what God called them to do.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; And when they did what God called them
[1:05:09] to do, there was no issue. But it was
[1:05:11] when they tried to step outside that. I
[1:05:13] hope you're hearing me, church. That's
[1:05:14] what as a minister, it's my job to do
[1:05:17] what God calls me to do and not to be
[1:05:19] try something bigger than what I am. Not
[1:05:21] to try to be the messenger of the age.
[1:05:23] Are you with me now? My job is to stand
[1:05:26] for the message of the hour and to
[1:05:27] preach the word of God and to help
[1:05:29] people any way that I can. Lord, help me
[1:05:31] to do that.
[1:05:33] But if I get beyond that and I get in
[1:05:35] trouble
[1:05:37] now, and the same goes true with anybody
[1:05:39] with any office in the church or any any
[1:05:42] job to do. All of us have some job to
[1:05:45] do. There's 11 psalms that were to be
[1:05:49] sung by the sons of Kora. Do you know
[1:05:51] that 11 of the psalms were written just
[1:05:53] for the sons of Kora to sing
[1:05:56] because they were fine in their
[1:05:57] position, but they couldn't stand in
[1:05:59] Moses' place or Aaron's place.
[1:06:02] So after this event number 17, that's
[1:06:05] just background to where we want to go
[1:06:06] this morning, the Lord spake to Moses,
[1:06:10] saying, speaking to the children of
[1:06:12] Israel, take every one of them a rod
[1:06:14] according to the house of their fathers,
[1:06:16] of all their princes, according to the
[1:06:18] house of their fathers, 12 rods. Write
[1:06:20] thou every man's name upon his rod.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah. So they had a rod with each one.
[1:06:26] Each elder was identified with a certain
[1:06:30] family name. They identified they
[1:06:32] brought their rod and brought it up to
[1:06:34] where all the rods laid before the the
[1:06:37] tabernacle and they went and brought
[1:06:39] them into the holy of holies. There was
[1:06:41] a can we say it like this? A Methodist,
[1:06:44] a Baptist, a Pentecostal,
[1:06:48] right? oneness, tuness,
[1:06:50] go a little bit further, you know,
[1:06:52] return ministry,
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; right? You could all the whatever name
[1:06:56] people want to be called by.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; Come on,
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; right? Five-fold ministry, tape,
[1:07:02] whatever name they want to be called by,
[1:07:04] but there would only be one,
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; That would come to life.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; One rod out of all of those rods
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; would bear fruit.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Oh church, you realize what we're
[1:07:19] seeing today. What we're dealing with
[1:07:21] today is we're dealing with the fact
[1:07:24] that we're beginning to see the fruit of
[1:07:26] this message. I believe for years maybe
[1:07:29] we've struggled through some hard times,
[1:07:31] some dry times, but I believe we're
[1:07:32] beginning to see the fruit of what this
[1:07:34] message came to do. I I don't believe
[1:07:37] this is a time of worry and of fear, but
[1:07:39] I believe this is a time when we're
[1:07:41] beginning to see a blooming and a
[1:07:43] blossoming and a and a fruition of all
[1:07:45] the things that have been preached, God
[1:07:47] is choosing who is his. Even in a time
[1:07:49] of lessia, even in the darkest time
[1:07:52] that's ever been, even in a time when
[1:07:54] when all the other rods are failing to
[1:07:56] produce life, there is one that does.
[1:07:58] That's not this church. That's not my
[1:08:00] ministry, but that's the message of the
[1:08:02] hour. What God chose, the elect of God
[1:08:05] that God chose is bringing forth fruit
[1:08:07] in this hour.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:12] He said, "Write every man's name upon
[1:08:14] his rod, and thou shalt write Aaron's
[1:08:16] name upon the rod of Levi. For one rod
[1:08:18] shall be for the head of the house of
[1:08:19] their fathers. Thou shalt lay them up in
[1:08:21] the tabernacle of the congregation
[1:08:22] before the testimony, that's the ark,
[1:08:25] where I will meet with you. It shall
[1:08:27] come to pass that the man's rod whom I
[1:08:29] shall choose shall blossom."
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah. and I will make to cease from me
[1:08:34] the murmurings of the children of
[1:08:36] Israel, whereby they murmur against
[1:08:39] you." You see, Aaron's rod would prove
[1:08:41] that it wasn't Moses that made the
[1:08:43] choice. It was God making a choice.
[1:08:47] Numbers 17:6, Moses spake to the
[1:08:49] children of Israel. Every one of the
[1:08:50] princes gave him a rod of peace, and one
[1:08:53] according to their father's houses, even
[1:08:55] 12 rods, the rod of Aaron was among
[1:08:56] their rods. And Moses laid up the rods
[1:08:58] before the Lord in the tabernacle of
[1:09:01] witness. Now, keep in mind what they've
[1:09:03] just been through. Kora has just made a
[1:09:06] challenge. If you go read the rest of
[1:09:07] that chapter, Kora and Dayan and Abram
[1:09:10] were all consumed. And when they were,
[1:09:12] the people of Israel got mad. Children
[1:09:13] of Israel got mad at Moses.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; Cuz they said, "You've killed
[1:09:17] Israelites. You've killed our brethren."
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; And Moses didn't do it. God did it.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; So Moses said, "Now we're going to see
[1:09:24] who God has called.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; Let's lay all the rods, all these dead
[1:09:29] sticks,
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; in front preach
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; of the word.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; In the presence of the Lord.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; Before the word, in the presence of the
[1:09:38] shikina, all the sticks were laid. Now
[1:09:42] look, he said, "It come to pass on the
[1:09:44] tomorrow Moses went into the tabernacle
[1:09:46] of witness, and behold, the rod of
[1:09:47] Aaron, for the house of Levi was budded,
[1:09:50] and brought forth buds and bloom
[1:09:51] blossoms and yielded almonds."
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something, church. If
[1:09:56] you're not yielding fruit, one of two
[1:09:57] things is wrong. Either
[1:10:01] you come from the wrong tree,
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; I'm just going to go ahead and say
[1:10:09] that's not true of any of us today. I
[1:10:11] believe that you're the predestined of
[1:10:12] God
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; or you wouldn't be here this morning.
[1:10:15] That's the way we we need to believe.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; But you can't get blood out of a
[1:10:18] tournament. If a person is not
[1:10:19] predestined elected by God, they can't
[1:10:21] be saved.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; And that's harsh, but it's the truth. I
[1:10:24] don't want to make us thank God for
[1:10:25] election and thank God for
[1:10:27] predestination. I say they can't be
[1:10:28] saved. They cannot be in the elect.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; Right. A person cannot be in the elect.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; Right. Unless they are unless they are
[1:10:37] one of the elect.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; So, so that that could be the problem.
[1:10:41] But I'll say this. I don't think that's
[1:10:42] the problem. I think the problem if
[1:10:44] you're having trouble producing fruit in
[1:10:46] your life. Maybe all the fruit you
[1:10:48] produce has been evil. Maybe everything
[1:10:50] you try to do in your life has has been
[1:10:52] bad and it's all just produced something
[1:10:54] terrible in your life and you think,
[1:10:55] "I've just made a failure out of my
[1:10:57] life." Don't you realize maybe the
[1:10:59] problem is you've not been in the
[1:11:00] presence of the shikina. You've not been
[1:11:03] sitting there in front of the word
[1:11:04] because Aaron's rod was just like any
[1:11:06] other rod until it come in the
[1:11:08] tabernacle of testimony. Until it was
[1:11:10] placed before the shakina glory until it
[1:11:13] was placed right there before the man
[1:11:15] and the word.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:20] That may be the problem. Just not enough
[1:11:23] time in the tabernacle of testimony.
[1:11:30] Moses brought all the rods before the
[1:11:31] Lord and to the children of Israel. And
[1:11:32] they looked and took every man his rod.
[1:11:35] And the Lord said to Moses, "Bring
[1:11:36] Aaron's rod again before the testimony
[1:11:39] to be kept for a token against the
[1:11:41] rebels." Thou shalt quite take away
[1:11:43] their murmurings from me that they die
[1:11:46] not.
[1:11:48] See, they thought the priesthood of
[1:11:49] Aaron was just Moses opinion, but God
[1:11:51] said was his word. Now, you realize
[1:11:52] today
[1:11:54] that we are kings and priests. We've
[1:11:56] preached on that lately, but how many
[1:11:58] know that you're kings and priests,
[1:12:00] spiritual kings and priests? 1 Peter
[1:12:01] 2:5, you also as lively stones are built
[1:12:04] up a spiritual house, a holy priesthood
[1:12:06] to offer up spiritual sacrifices
[1:12:08] acceptable to God by Jesus Christ. So
[1:12:12] you are a holy priesthood, a spiritual
[1:12:16] priesthood, a spiritual house. In other
[1:12:17] words, he's building like the ironic
[1:12:19] priesthood, but this would be a
[1:12:20] priesthood after the order of Melzdc
[1:12:23] because he was the great high priest
[1:12:26] after the order of Melzdc. See, it was
[1:12:29] no accident that Moses made Aaron a
[1:12:31] priest. It was no accident that we were
[1:12:33] identified by a word prophet in this age
[1:12:36] as the bride.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; Right? He said, "I'm going to call you
[1:12:39] bride. See that you'll understand it."
[1:12:42] Yeah.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; Those who didn't hear it or didn't
[1:12:44] comprehend it, they can't. They might
[1:12:46] hear it and not comprehend it. But if
[1:12:48] you can understand that today, he's
[1:12:50] talking to you. Oh, come on, church. If
[1:12:52] if you can if you can grab a hold of
[1:12:54] that, know what that means, then he's
[1:12:56] talking to you, cuz that can only come
[1:12:57] by revelation. He said, "I'm going to
[1:12:59] call you bride."
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That you'll understand it.
[1:13:04] What was he doing? He was telling you
[1:13:06] who you are, just like Moses told Aaron
[1:13:08] who he was.
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; Right. But the but what vindicates that?
[1:13:12] Are you with me now? It's the life that
[1:13:15] you bear. It's the fruit that you bear
[1:13:16] that vindicates who you are. So this
[1:13:19] message came by a vindicated prophet.
[1:13:21] Not to not to prove who he was. Right.
[1:13:24] He there was a vindication to prove he
[1:13:26] who he was, but the message came to
[1:13:28] vindicate us.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? I don't need
[1:13:32] supernatural vindication. I need fruit
[1:13:35] vindication.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; I need manifestation vindication. I
[1:13:39] believe signs follow the believer. I
[1:13:41] believe supernatural follows the church
[1:13:43] of the living God. How many believe that
[1:13:44] today? We've seen lives change. We've
[1:13:47] seen we've seen the sick healed. We've
[1:13:48] seen we've seen everything happen like
[1:13:50] that. But I'm that's not what I'm
[1:13:52] looking for. That follows those that
[1:13:54] believe. But that's not what I'm looking
[1:13:55] for to vindicate my life. I'm looking
[1:13:57] for love and joy and peace and
[1:13:59] longsuffering and gentleness and
[1:14:00] kindness, the fruits of the spirit to
[1:14:02] begin to live what God said a Christian
[1:14:05] would be in Leodysia. for that to begin
[1:14:07] to manifest itself in my life.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; So
[1:14:15] the vindication of the message is us,
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:14:22] The proof of who you are is when a dead
[1:14:26] stick.
[1:14:30] Now, why was it dead? Let's just stop
[1:14:31] there for a minute. It was dead because
[1:14:34] it was separated from the life of God.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; But it was still an almond tree,
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; But it was dead and it was separated
[1:14:45] from the life of God. And when it
[1:14:48] becomes separated from the life, it
[1:14:49] could no longer bear fruit. It just
[1:14:52] become a hard dead stick.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; Oh my. And and the older it got, the
[1:14:59] farther along got, it got harder. It got
[1:15:01] dead. It it would not naturally come to
[1:15:04] life unless it got in the presence of
[1:15:07] the shakina glory.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; It had to be reconnected to the life.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; So what it had to do now, it had to go
[1:15:15] through a process of of of blooming. Had
[1:15:18] to go through a process of blossoming.
[1:15:20] It had to go through a process of
[1:15:22] bearing fruit. And that's what we do
[1:15:24] when we come through. We come through.
[1:15:26] And as a church, you could say that the
[1:15:28] dead stick, if you typed it to being the
[1:15:30] entire church or the bride, it's come
[1:15:32] through justification, sanctification,
[1:15:35] and the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And
[1:15:37] then it begins to bear fruit. Now, in
[1:15:39] the presence of the dynamics and the
[1:15:41] mechanics, the word and the spirit, the
[1:15:43] dead stick that Aaron had carried for
[1:15:45] years become like a tree planted by the
[1:15:47] rivers of water.
[1:15:50] a 24 hours in the presence of the
[1:15:52] shikina
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; made a stick that was completely dead
[1:15:56] begin to actually have fruit on it. So
[1:15:59] that's the three stages of life for an
[1:16:01] almond tree is buds, blossoms, and
[1:16:05] fruit. It was already an almond tree,
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; but it had been cut off from life. Now,
[1:16:10] there's something special about an
[1:16:11] almond tree. Something special about an
[1:16:14] almond tree. It's not just like any
[1:16:16] other tree. There's a reason why God
[1:16:19] chose the rod from an almond tree. So,
[1:16:23] it had been cut off from the almond
[1:16:25] life, but it had to go through these
[1:16:27] stages to bear fruit. Now, in Jeremiah 1
[1:16:31] and vers 11, Jeremiah had a very
[1:16:33] difficult message to preach. I I don't
[1:16:35] envy Jeremiah at all. In fact, he said,
[1:16:37] "I'm going to quit preaching." And God
[1:16:38] said, "No, you're not." You know, and
[1:16:40] Jeremiah did his best to quit. And he to
[1:16:42] try to give it up. And and I think we've
[1:16:45] all felt like that sometime or another.
[1:16:47] I'm going to quit being a Christian. And
[1:16:48] God said, "No, you're not."
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; But Jeremiah had a very difficult
[1:16:52] message to preach. And he had to preach
[1:16:54] to the people, "Go on into Babylon. Go
[1:16:56] into captivity. You're not going to win
[1:16:58] this war." Could you imagine being in
[1:17:00] the Second World War, a war that
[1:17:02] threatened your very existence or
[1:17:04] something like that? And then people,
[1:17:06] you go into the White House and tell
[1:17:07] them, "You're not going to win. You're
[1:17:09] not going to win. You need to give in.
[1:17:10] You need to let it let the Japanese have
[1:17:12] it. at the we wouldn't even we throw the
[1:17:14] man in prison for spreading sedition and
[1:17:16] that's exactly what they did to Jeremiah
[1:17:19] but at the very beginning of his
[1:17:20] ministry in Jeremiah chapter 1 11 God
[1:17:23] showed Jeremiah something to strengthen
[1:17:25] his faith he said moreover the word of
[1:17:27] the Lord came to me saying Jeremiah what
[1:17:29] seeest thou and I said I see a rod of an
[1:17:32] almond tree
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; cuz God was going to reveal to Jeremiah
[1:17:36] that things weren't always going to be
[1:17:38] as bad as they were right then
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; oh come on church they weren't always
[1:17:42] going going to be taken into captivity.
[1:17:44] Listen to me, church. If you can just
[1:17:45] see a glimpse of hope this morning, if
[1:17:48] you may have been separated from life,
[1:17:50] but there's a lifegiver here this
[1:17:52] morning that can tell you it's not
[1:17:53] always going to be like that, but you
[1:17:55] begin to see a bud in the presence of
[1:17:57] God.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; And so, he said, Jeremiah, what do you
[1:18:01] see? He said, I see a rod of an almond
[1:18:03] tree. And said the Lord unto me, thou
[1:18:05] hast well seen, for I will hasten my
[1:18:08] word to perform it.
[1:18:11] And the reason he said that, it's almost
[1:18:12] a play on words because the almond tree
[1:18:14] was the very first to bear fruit in
[1:18:17] Israel when everything else was still
[1:18:20] dead. The almond proclaimed spring is
[1:18:23] coming.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; So the almond tree bore fruit in March.
[1:18:28] You know, kind of like what happens
[1:18:30] around here is some yellow flowers,
[1:18:31] whatever those are. Forgive me for not
[1:18:34] knowing my basic flowers, but them
[1:18:36] yellow flowers come up and and that's
[1:18:39] escaping me this morning, the the name
[1:18:41] of them, but uh little daisies or
[1:18:43] something.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; Daffodils, that's what they are.
[1:18:46] Daffodils begin to come up and
[1:18:48] everything else is still dead. You ever
[1:18:50] notice that everything is still dead,
[1:18:52] but you just let a little warm sun come
[1:18:54] down at the right time of year in March
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; and them daffodil start springing up
[1:18:58] everywhere.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah. They don't bloom for long, but
[1:19:01] it's the first sign of spring,
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; right? The first Oh, come on, church.
[1:19:06] The first sign of spring is the daffodil
[1:19:08] coming to life. And God told Jeremiah,
[1:19:10] he said, "I want you to I want you to
[1:19:12] look at the almond tree.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; What do you see, Jeremiah? An almond
[1:19:16] tree." He said, "That's the first thing
[1:19:17] that's coming to life. Everything else
[1:19:19] might look bad. Everything else might be
[1:19:21] dead. It might look like in your life
[1:19:23] that things are over. It might the
[1:19:25] doctor might have said you'll never be
[1:19:26] healed. The people my around you might
[1:19:28] say you'll never be any different than
[1:19:29] you are now. But look at the look what
[1:19:31] the almond tree says.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; There's a potential to the almond tree.
[1:19:35] It's the first thing. It's the first
[1:19:37] fruits of life.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; And God said, "I'm not going to leave
[1:19:43] you down there long. I'll hasten my word
[1:19:46] to perform it.
[1:19:49] Spring is coming." The almond proclaimed
[1:19:51] spring is coming.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; Oh my. And that's what it did to Aaron's
[1:19:56] rod. Brother Brandon said it so
[1:19:57] beautifully in a hidden life. He says in
[1:20:00] this same place they put Aaron's rod to
[1:20:01] make a decision who God had chosen and
[1:20:03] who he hadn't. And that rod that was a
[1:20:06] dead stick. In one night's time come to
[1:20:09] life, brought buds, brought flowers, and
[1:20:14] brought almonds.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; It both come to life, brought blossoms,
[1:20:17] and yielded fruits. A very typical
[1:20:20] pattern of the sinner being brought to
[1:20:23] God into the holy place.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; That rod was off of an almond tree and
[1:20:29] when it was cut off, it died.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; And when man was cut off from God, he
[1:20:33] died spiritually.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; You can't fix a spiritual death with a
[1:20:40] 12step program.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; You can't fix a spiritual death. Those
[1:20:44] things are wonderful, but that's not how
[1:20:46] you fix spiritual death. You can't fix
[1:20:48] spiritual death with just trying to
[1:20:50] reform. You young people say, "Well,
[1:20:52] I'll do better. I'll do better. I'll
[1:20:53] turn over a new leaf." That's not how
[1:20:54] you fix spiritual death. The way you fix
[1:20:57] spiritual death is by coming into the
[1:20:59] Holy of Holies, entering into the
[1:21:01] baptism of the Holy Ghost, believing the
[1:21:03] word, and walking into the presence of
[1:21:05] God.
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; Church, we do a lot of things as a
[1:21:13] church.
[1:21:15] We we we teach those that need taught.
[1:21:18] We we try to coach up our parents and
[1:21:20] our children and our young people and we
[1:21:23] try to teach our Sunday school children.
[1:21:25] I'm thankful for you teachers that do
[1:21:26] that. You're doing a wonderful job. I
[1:21:28] appreciate you doing it. We try to teach
[1:21:30] our young people how to act and how to
[1:21:32] behave and we try to we try to lift you
[1:21:35] up in every way that we can. We've even
[1:21:38] tried to, you know, talk about finances
[1:21:40] and talk about all those things cuz
[1:21:42] they're useful things. But the most
[1:21:44] important thing that we do
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; is to bring people into the presence of
[1:21:50] God.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; Because no matter how many much you
[1:21:55] teach a ro a dead stick how to bear
[1:21:58] fruit, it'll never bear fruit until the
[1:22:02] life of the word comes inside of it.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; And it begins to bear what it is.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; It has to be. That's that's it's got to
[1:22:10] be a process of got to come to life. So
[1:22:12] the most important thing that we do, but
[1:22:14] I think we ought to take time for it. I
[1:22:16] think we ought to make sure things are
[1:22:18] right for it. I think we ought to set an
[1:22:20] atmosphere for it. We ought to behave
[1:22:21] ourselves in the sanctuary because we
[1:22:23] know that this is a place where God can
[1:22:26] bring a dead stick to life.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; It's a place where God can move over a
[1:22:31] heart, over a mind, over a soul and
[1:22:33] begin to change.
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; Begin to change a dead stick into a
[1:22:39] productive productive tree. Brother
[1:22:42] said, "When man was cut off from God, he
[1:22:44] died spiritually. But once brought into
[1:22:46] the presence of God, before the presence
[1:22:47] of God, he comes to life and he yields
[1:22:49] life. He yields blossoms. He yields
[1:22:51] fruit. Jesus come to a tree one time to
[1:22:53] look for fruit on it. It had everything
[1:22:56] but fruit."
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; Remember the fig tree and what did he
[1:23:00] do? He cursed it.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; It had everything. It had leaves but it
[1:23:03] had no fruit.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; And that's what's the matter. He said
[1:23:05] with our churches today, we got
[1:23:07] everything but fruit. We can shout. We
[1:23:08] can speak with tongues. We can argue the
[1:23:10] scriptures. We can teach our theology,
[1:23:12] but when it comes to fruit bearing, the
[1:23:14] tree is very lean. Listen to me this
[1:23:16] morning. Word of Life Tabernacle. It
[1:23:17] don't matter how much we know. Doesn't
[1:23:19] matter how much we've been taught. How
[1:23:20] come we can explain the opening of the
[1:23:22] word? We can explain the mysteries from
[1:23:24] beginning to end. We can talk all about
[1:23:26] the seals and the church ages and
[1:23:27] everything else. If we do not bear
[1:23:29] fruit, we're worthless.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me today? If we don't
[1:23:34] bear fruit, we're worthless. We can't do
[1:23:36] anything for a lost and dying world. We
[1:23:39] can't be a credit to our community. We
[1:23:41] can't help people unless we bear fruit.
[1:23:43] It doesn't matter how much we can argue
[1:23:45] about the scripture. It doesn't matter
[1:23:46] how right we are.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; Or how much we shout or how much we
[1:23:50] dance or how much Come on, church. How
[1:23:52] much we get. I believe in those things,
[1:23:54] but it don't matter how much we do it.
[1:23:55] If we don't bear fruit, we're dead.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, God. Brother Brandham looked at that
[1:24:04] denominational church, that Pentecostal
[1:24:05] church, which was very emotional, but he
[1:24:08] said, "The tree is very lean."
[1:24:11] Now, we see trees that aren't even
[1:24:12] emotional. That there's not even any
[1:24:14] leaves on them.
[1:24:17] This this the Pentecostal church that he
[1:24:20] looked at, they were emotional,
[1:24:22] but they were didn't have any fruit.
[1:24:25] The B said, "Notice what a beautiful
[1:24:26] picture of the sinner laying in the
[1:24:28] presence of God.
[1:24:30] This rod laying there, it was refreshed.
[1:24:31] She was fragrant
[1:24:33] brought the fragrance of the blossom. It
[1:24:36] yielded fruit. The buds came forth. He
[1:24:38] said, "Now the tree had to be an almond
[1:24:39] tree to start with." And Christ, you
[1:24:41] have to receive him before you come into
[1:24:43] this place. So the first step is to
[1:24:45] accept Christ. To receive him. If you
[1:24:48] haven't done that, you need to do that.
[1:24:50] To accept him. It's more than just a
[1:24:51] mental conception, but to accept him as
[1:24:54] Lord of your life.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; Lord, I accept you have control in my
[1:24:58] life. I believe in you. And he said,
[1:25:00] "Notice the first thing was a
[1:25:02] refreshment."
[1:25:03] He said, 'What makes the seed grow? Did
[1:25:06] you ever get of the morning, up of the
[1:25:08] morning, and find the dew that fell down
[1:25:10] from heaven and refreshes the earth?
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; How many of you walked outside this
[1:25:16] morning and thought, "My, it feels
[1:25:17] good."
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; It was refreshing, wasn't it? The
[1:25:22] coolness of it. And you thought, "My,
[1:25:24] what a refreshment to be in that in that
[1:25:26] place." Listen, we've got a honeysuckle
[1:25:29] bush not far from our door. I just love
[1:25:32] walking out in the morning when it's
[1:25:34] cool. I don't want to come out there
[1:25:35] when it's 99 and it's got high humidity,
[1:25:38] but when it's cool and and like it is
[1:25:41] now and and you get up in the morning
[1:25:43] and find the dew is fallen. Brother
[1:25:45] Brandon said, "How does it refresh it
[1:25:47] when it's at peace?" Now, listen to me.
[1:25:51] What what what many people are trying to
[1:25:52] do is they're trying to refresh
[1:25:54] themselves,
[1:25:56] but in a place where there's no peace,
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; right? You're trying to refresh
[1:26:01] yourself, but you're always on your
[1:26:02] phone.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; Trying to refresh yourself, but you're
[1:26:06] always watching television.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; Trying to refresh yourself, but you're
[1:26:09] always just doing something, going
[1:26:11] somewhere and doing something and
[1:26:13] carrying on. But that's not what he
[1:26:14] called us to do.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; The way to refreshment is through peace.
[1:26:20] And the only peace we can find is with
[1:26:22] him.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; So we need to come into his presence,
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; Right. We need some time with God.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; I feel like today and I think we did a
[1:26:34] poll one time of young people and the
[1:26:35] young people in that that group that we
[1:26:37] were talking to said that the number one
[1:26:39] thing they struggle with is not, you
[1:26:41] know, young people struggle with a lot
[1:26:43] of things. pornography and and and the
[1:26:45] internet and and other young people not
[1:26:48] treating them right and all kinds of
[1:26:49] depression and but they said the number
[1:26:51] one thing they dealt with was was not
[1:26:54] read not being able to read their Bible
[1:26:55] and pray like they wanted to not having
[1:26:58] time to spend with God.
[1:27:00] And the truth is a lot of the other
[1:27:02] issues would begin to go away if we
[1:27:04] spent more time with the Lord.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; I see it as the number one lack and I'm
[1:27:09] preaching to myself and to every one of
[1:27:12] us. The number one lack
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; that we preachers have
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; the number one lack that people have is
[1:27:20] not spending the time in the presence of
[1:27:23] the Lord,
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; Not taking the time. I'm not talking
[1:27:27] about just here in the church, although
[1:27:29] we should have it here too, but I'm
[1:27:30] talking about at home. Amen.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; When you get down on your knees and pray
[1:27:35] to God and when when you talk to God
[1:27:37] alone, when you get out, maybe maybe
[1:27:39] you're out hunting or you're fishing or
[1:27:40] you're doing something uh you know,
[1:27:42] you're walking out in nature or
[1:27:43] something like that and you just you
[1:27:45] just get time to refresh yourself in the
[1:27:48] presence of God. You need that time.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; You need that time. And Satan's stolen
[1:27:54] that from us
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; until technology has even invaded the
[1:27:59] hunting sphere and and fishing and
[1:28:01] things like that. So some places y'all
[1:28:03] go. I guess there's probably no signal,
[1:28:04] but but it's invaded everything that we
[1:28:07] do
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; until we can't get off of it
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; where we're connected all the time. And
[1:28:12] it's not that it's bad, but where do we
[1:28:14] find peace?
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; Good.
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; You got to be able to find a moment
[1:28:18] where God can talk to you. Yeah.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; He's speaking, but we're not hearing him
[1:28:22] because of all the things that we got
[1:28:24] going on.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; So, the number one thing I think that we
[1:28:31] our services would be better. We'd have
[1:28:34] less less counseling to do. We'd have
[1:28:36] less problems in the home. We'd have
[1:28:38] come on, it'd affect every area of our
[1:28:40] life if we begin to get down on our
[1:28:41] knees and just really spending time with
[1:28:43] God and say, "Today, I'm going to let
[1:28:45] all these things go and I'm going to
[1:28:47] spend some time in the presence of the
[1:28:48] Lord.
[1:28:52] Brother B says the de don't fall in
[1:28:54] daytime.
[1:28:55] The de falls in the nighttime when
[1:28:58] everything is at peace.
[1:29:00] The de can never fall on you, my
[1:29:02] brother, as long as you're fussing.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; If that's the way, if your home is a
[1:29:12] constant fuss,
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; come on.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; How is the Holy Ghost going to speak? Y
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; you said, "But brother Ben, I don't know
[1:29:19] how to stop."
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; Just stop.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; If you didn't feel the need to say
[1:29:28] anything back, there wouldn't be no
[1:29:30] fuss.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; Said, "But that would mean I took the
[1:29:33] wrong." Exactly.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; There was no fuss.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; I don't even know why I'm saying this
[1:29:39] this morning, but there was no fuss when
[1:29:41] Christ went to Calvary.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; He didn't fuss with Pilate. He didn't
[1:29:46] fuss with Anna and the the high priest
[1:29:48] and Caesar.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; He didn't fuss with the guards.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; There was no fuss cuz he would not allow
[1:29:56] himself to fuss. He was like a lamb
[1:29:57] before the slaughter. Listen to me,
[1:29:59] church. What was he doing? He was doing
[1:30:00] it for a purpose for us. How I wonder if
[1:30:03] we could sacrifice ourselves for the
[1:30:04] purpose of peace in my home. I'm not
[1:30:06] going to I'm not going to just I'm not
[1:30:08] going to uh just fight and fuss and
[1:30:10] argue and and carry on. But some of you
[1:30:13] young people, you just you just bristle
[1:30:14] at everything mom and dad say, and you
[1:30:16] got to talk back and say something. Why
[1:30:18] don't you make a commitment today that
[1:30:20] you're going to keep your mouth shut
[1:30:21] once in a while and and for an
[1:30:24] opportunity for God to begin to heal
[1:30:26] your home?
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; You're fussing and arguing and stewing
[1:30:34] about the things here on earth. He said,
[1:30:36] "Get along with God. Let the dew drops
[1:30:37] of mercy
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; fall upon you in the stillness.
[1:30:44] how that God can get his believer with
[1:30:46] the curtains dropped around him alone to
[1:30:48] himself.
[1:30:51] You know, we complain about things. We
[1:30:53] ought to use them as opportunities.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; I know a lot of us drive. We drive to
[1:30:57] work. I drove to work for all my career
[1:31:02] 50, excuse me, 15 years. I drove no
[1:31:05] matter where I worked, I was 45 minutes
[1:31:07] from work. It just I don't know why it
[1:31:09] happened that way, but it just was. You
[1:31:11] know what I found? It was a great time
[1:31:13] in the presence of God.
[1:31:16] Some of the strongest moments and it
[1:31:18] wasn't always that way. You understand?
[1:31:20] Sometimes you you let things invade that
[1:31:22] and do other things. But but when I
[1:31:24] allowed it to happen, it was the most
[1:31:27] awesome time in the presence of the
[1:31:29] Lord. I got to where I coveted that time
[1:31:33] just me in in the car with a tape play
[1:31:35] or sometimes with nothing and just
[1:31:37] sitting there thinking about the things
[1:31:38] of God and the presence of God would
[1:31:40] come in the car. We we don't know. We
[1:31:43] complain about things. Maybe we ought to
[1:31:44] value that time.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; If you live a little ways from work,
[1:31:47] take that time today. I'm not going to
[1:31:49] worry about sports. I'm not going to
[1:31:50] worry about who beat who. I'm not going
[1:31:52] to worry about what's going on at the
[1:31:53] house. Lord, I just want to tell you how
[1:31:55] much I love you. I just want to tell you
[1:31:57] how much you mean to me. I just want to
[1:31:58] tell you what what the what what I would
[1:32:01] be without you, Lord. I just thank you
[1:32:02] for saving me. Thank you for healing me.
[1:32:05] Thank you for giving me my family. Thank
[1:32:07] you even if it's not complete yet. Thank
[1:32:09] you for the restoration of all that
[1:32:11] belongs to me.
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; How that God can get his believer with
[1:32:21] the curtains dropped around him alone to
[1:32:23] himself. to bring down a refreshing from
[1:32:24] heaven that there's no other person, no
[1:32:26] other way in the world ever know it.
[1:32:28] Only that he's laying he that's laying
[1:32:30] there. Did you ever walk out in the
[1:32:32] morning and that real fresh cool
[1:32:33] feeling? God has refreshed his earth
[1:32:36] fragrance. Did you ever go into a rose
[1:32:38] garden? He said down my place they got a
[1:32:40] lot of honeysuckles. The honeysuckle
[1:32:41] don't smell much along in the heat of
[1:32:43] the day but it's early of the morning
[1:32:44] when all the air has been purified. That
[1:32:47] aroma of the honeysuckle. He said let a
[1:32:49] man be out fussing, fighting, stewing.
[1:32:51] You'll never get much of aroma from that
[1:32:53] of the gospel, but let him get alone one
[1:32:55] time in the stillness of God.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; He said, "Every man that comes to the
[1:32:59] pulpit ought to dwell alone first."
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; I fight for that more than anything else
[1:33:06] in my ministry. Give me some time, some
[1:33:08] time where I can be by myself and spend
[1:33:10] some time in the presence of God. And
[1:33:12] yes, sometimes you got to sacrifice some
[1:33:14] things to do that. But Lord, let me have
[1:33:15] that time because fruit comes out of
[1:33:17] that.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:33:21] said, "Every man ought to that comes
[1:33:22] ought to dwell alone first." I've told
[1:33:24] the preachers, "We want preachers to
[1:33:26] study. We want them to study. We want to
[1:33:28] study as much time as there is to study.
[1:33:30] We we want to hear something real. We
[1:33:32] want to hear something that you studied
[1:33:34] and you spent time on and things like
[1:33:36] that. We don't want to hear some some
[1:33:37] last minute sermon, but I'll say this.
[1:33:39] If you come to a time where you don't
[1:33:41] you only have time for one, pray."
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; If you only have time to to pray, pray.
[1:33:47] And God will God will help you when you
[1:33:48] get up to preach. Get yourself in the
[1:33:51] presence of God. Even if you maybe
[1:33:54] couldn't study as much as you wanted to.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon says, "Every man that
[1:34:00] comes to the pulpit ought to dwell
[1:34:01] alone. First thing comes the fruits,
[1:34:02] yielding forth his fruits. Every man
[1:34:04] that stays in the presence of God into
[1:34:06] this great secret place hid away will
[1:34:08] yield the fruits of righteousness,
[1:34:10] peace, love, joy, longsuffering,
[1:34:12] goodness, gentleness, patience.
[1:34:16] Don't fuss about these other things. get
[1:34:18] that in your life and you'll never get
[1:34:20] it until you hide away with God in that
[1:34:23] land of adoption.
[1:34:25] You think about it, you know, say,
[1:34:27] "Well,
[1:34:30] me and my husband, we fuss all the time.
[1:34:32] It's harder to fuss when you just walked
[1:34:34] out of that presence."
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; It just is.
[1:34:40] Well, me and my kids, we just fuss and
[1:34:43] fight.
[1:34:44] Well, they may need a whooping, but
[1:34:47] maybe they're too old for that.
[1:34:51] They just fuss and fight all the time.
[1:34:54] It's hard to do that if you brought your
[1:34:57] family together in his presence.
[1:35:02] It's hard. I've noticed people get to
[1:35:04] picking at one another in church,
[1:35:06] picking at the way the food is done or
[1:35:09] picking at the way this is done or that.
[1:35:10] Not nobody's doing that right now, but
[1:35:12] y'all are y'all are so gracious. I
[1:35:14] appreciate it. But they'll pick about
[1:35:16] the fellowship hall or pick about the
[1:35:17] Sunday school or pick about the
[1:35:19] preacher, pick about this or that. It's
[1:35:21] hard to do that
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; if you've just been scoured out by his
[1:35:25] presence.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; And you really entered into the service
[1:35:29] and you you stood there and said, "Lord,
[1:35:31] I'm I know I'm a sinner.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; I need help myself, Lord." It's hard to
[1:35:36] look in judgment on anyone else.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon said, "You get in that
[1:35:40] place and walk out, everybody looks good
[1:35:42] to you."
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; See, some folks claim to have all the
[1:35:47] word. I don't doubt that they do. All
[1:35:50] the word was in the ark.
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; But unless the shikina was there, it
[1:35:55] would just be a dead word.
[1:35:59] But in that presence, the word could
[1:36:00] produce life in a dead stick. It's
[1:36:03] refreshing. See, what is the word
[1:36:06] producing in your life? Remember there
[1:36:08] were two sons of Eli who were who really
[1:36:12] were in the ironic priesthood. They were
[1:36:14] in the right line
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; but they were evil themselves.
[1:36:19] They were just in it for the money
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; and other things. And they they come
[1:36:23] down these these sons of Balile the
[1:36:25] Bible calls them and and the children of
[1:36:27] Israel went down got beat in the battle
[1:36:28] with the Philistines. They said we know
[1:36:29] what we'll do. We'll go get the ark.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; And the Hoffne and Phinehos the sons of
[1:36:34] Eli come out there with the ark. And
[1:36:35] they thought, "Boy, we're going to beat
[1:36:36] them this time." Even the Philistines
[1:36:38] thought they were beat.
[1:36:41] But the Philistines rose up and
[1:36:42] slaughtered them. Took the ark from
[1:36:45] them. What happened? It didn't produce
[1:36:48] anything. It didn't produce any life.
[1:36:51] Oh, church. There was no presence there
[1:36:55] because they had not they had not spent
[1:36:57] any time. They didn't even realize. And
[1:36:58] there was a baby being born to one of
[1:37:00] those brothers. I think it was Finos had
[1:37:02] a baby born at that time. And when the
[1:37:04] wife when the mother uh when the mother
[1:37:06] had the baby, she cried out and said,
[1:37:08] "His name is Kabad. The glory of the
[1:37:10] Lord has departed from Israel."
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; And he did not depart when they lost the
[1:37:14] ark in battle. He had already departed
[1:37:16] or they would have never lost the word.
[1:37:18] While they still had the word, the glory
[1:37:20] had already departed.
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; Cuz the way they were living,
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:37:27] Brother Brandon said, "Put Aaron's rod
[1:37:28] in there." An old dead almond tree. But
[1:37:31] as it went under the shakina of glory,
[1:37:32] everything it was
[1:37:37] sir.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; Do you feel like just a dry stick
[1:37:40] sometimes? Just a dead a dead almond
[1:37:42] tree. Just a you just dried up and said,
[1:37:45] "I haven't been in the presence of God
[1:37:46] in so long." But everything that you
[1:37:48] ever were is still in you.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. If you were chosen by God
[1:37:54] before the foundation of the world, you
[1:37:56] remember what peace was like. I remember
[1:37:58] what joy was like. I remember what it
[1:38:00] was like to enjoy church. I remember
[1:38:02] what it was like to shout down the
[1:38:03] house. I remember what it was like to
[1:38:05] feel the presence of God. Everything
[1:38:07] that you ever were, Brother Joe, is
[1:38:09] still in you.
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; Still in you. It's just waiting to be
[1:38:13] restored. And when it come in the
[1:38:15] presence of the shakina glory, all the
[1:38:17] life that ever was in that almond tree
[1:38:19] begin to come out.
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; Everything that it was, hallelujah,
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; was restored again. I say, God, bring me
[1:38:26] back this morning. If I ever had joy, I
[1:38:28] can have joy this morning. If I ever had
[1:38:30] peace, I can have peace this morning.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; He said, "That's the way a sinner is
[1:38:41] when he goes under the shakana glory of
[1:38:42] the Holy Spirit. The veil dropped behind
[1:38:44] him. Everything that ought to have
[1:38:45] been."
[1:38:47] Oh, God.
[1:38:49] Everything that he ought to have been.
[1:38:55] Oh, if he had never sinned, if you'd
[1:38:57] have never left the Lord, if you'd never
[1:38:59] done what you did, everything that he
[1:39:01] ought to have been,
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; son of God blooms out in him again.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I'm so glad for
[1:39:09] restoration. I'm so glad he doesn't
[1:39:11] leave us cut off from life. I'm so glad
[1:39:13] he Oh, come on, church. He doesn't leave
[1:39:15] us in our dead condition, but when we
[1:39:17] come back in the presence of God,
[1:39:19] everything that we ever were.
[1:39:21] Yes.
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said, "Remember,
[1:39:28] overnight it budded, blossom, grow
[1:39:30] almonds on it, fruits of the spirit,
[1:39:31] love, joy, longsuffering, goodness,
[1:39:35] gentleness, patience."
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; That's where we need to get in the third
[1:39:38] step. Get over into the shakina glory
[1:39:40] where that little sacred light was
[1:39:41] hanging over the mercy seat. That's the
[1:39:44] place to stay.
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; Where the man of the pot of mana sat
[1:39:48] down by the ark. That's the place to
[1:39:50] live.
[1:39:52] Hallelujah. You say, "Brother Ben, I
[1:39:54] I've made a decision for Christ. I I
[1:39:56] believe the message. Why is my life not
[1:39:58] yielding more fruit?"
[1:40:01] Brother Brandham said, "There's a mini
[1:40:02] almond tree right here in Minneapolis
[1:40:04] tonight where he was preaching." He
[1:40:06] said, "But the only thing is, as long as
[1:40:08] you're outside of this hidden life,
[1:40:10] you'll never be able to be refreshed and
[1:40:12] bring forth the fruits that God intended
[1:40:14] you to do until you come into the
[1:40:16] presence of God." What makes trees bud?
[1:40:19] It's a refreshment. What makes the
[1:40:21] refreshing early of a morning? You go
[1:40:23] out of early morning, you'll find out
[1:40:25] after the night everything gets still.
[1:40:26] The dew falls, it brings a refreshing.
[1:40:28] The trouble of it is today people don't
[1:40:30] have time to get before God and get
[1:40:31] still. They got so many things to do.
[1:40:34] They belong to this. They got to do
[1:40:35] this. They got to have this. They got to
[1:40:37] go there. You don't have time. The devil
[1:40:39] just took up all your time. You don't
[1:40:40] have time to get still before God and
[1:40:42] get quiet.
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; He said you're a nature.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; Right. So just like this is a I forget
[1:40:49] what they call a biosphere. This is a
[1:40:50] place where life is
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; right and everything's independent on or
[1:40:54] dependent rather on one another.
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; And if you take one thing like if you
[1:40:58] took coyotes out of the ecosystem it
[1:41:01] would change everything right? You take
[1:41:03] mosquitoes out as much as we hate them
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; and it would change everything because
[1:41:07] there's some purpose
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; in it right? So it's a nature. You you
[1:41:12] don't mess with nature you get in
[1:41:13] trouble.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; They found that out. So you don't have
[1:41:17] time. He said you're a nature and after
[1:41:20] all nature gets quiet and still then the
[1:41:22] dew begins to fall that refreshes and
[1:41:25] brings forth life. You are a nature
[1:41:27] yourself.
[1:41:29] See there's got to be a nighttime.
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; They say one of the most stressful
[1:41:32] things you can go through. You say,
[1:41:33] "Well, I want it to be sunny all the
[1:41:34] time." They say one of the most
[1:41:36] stressful things, some of you have
[1:41:37] experienced that where it's light in
[1:41:38] Alaska or wherever where it's light for
[1:41:40] 24 hours. They say after you've been
[1:41:42] there for a while, it stresses you out.
[1:41:44] That's
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:41:46] Because there's no night time,
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; there's no time to refresh.
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; A lot of times we look at the still
[1:41:53] times, the quiet times when we're not
[1:41:54] doing anything and say, "Well, you know,
[1:41:57] nothing's going on. I'm just so bored."
[1:42:00] And you don't realize that's the time
[1:42:01] that you need
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; to get still before God. The dew of
[1:42:06] heaven begins to fall and begins to
[1:42:07] refresh.
[1:42:11] I don't want to overstep my bounds here,
[1:42:12] but maybe that's why when we get older,
[1:42:15] but JT, as you get older, you get you
[1:42:17] can do less.
[1:42:19] Maybe God's getting you ready for his
[1:42:20] presence.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; You just get to a place where maybe
[1:42:25] physically you can't do as much. You got
[1:42:28] more time to spend in the presence of
[1:42:30] God. Maybe he's just getting you ready.
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:42:34] And maybe I know as you get older aches
[1:42:36] and pains come and things come and you
[1:42:38] don't understand why am I hurting? Why?
[1:42:40] But maybe just getting you ready for
[1:42:41] that time.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; You're going through the night but joy
[1:42:44] comes in the morning. Weeping endures
[1:42:46] for the night but joy comes in the
[1:42:48] morning. You got to go through the night
[1:42:50] time when you slow down a little bit and
[1:42:52] reflect on your life and really get down
[1:42:54] to business with God.
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; I would say this to our young people.
[1:43:01] You need to do that now. That's right.
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; Take time to do it now
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; because you don't know that you'll have
[1:43:07] a refreshing in the senior years of your
[1:43:10] life.
[1:43:15] Brother said that's what we need to do.
[1:43:17] What we need to do is get away and get
[1:43:18] quiet before God so he can bathe you
[1:43:20] with the refreshment from heaven. Get
[1:43:23] alone to yourself. Close the doors. Pull
[1:43:24] them together. Say, "Now Lord, here I am
[1:43:27] in your presence." Brother B used an
[1:43:29] illustration. He said that there was a
[1:43:30] man who raised hogs and he said his mama
[1:43:34] raised hogs and his daddy raised hogs
[1:43:36] and his grandpa raised hogs. Brother
[1:43:39] Brandon said you got talking to him all
[1:43:40] you could talk about was hogs.
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; Now that seems strange to us but you
[1:43:44] either in the cattle industry or if you
[1:43:46] love to hunt or fish or
[1:43:50] right it's hard not to talk about it.
[1:43:54] You know, if you're if you're got a
[1:43:55] certain trade that you enjoy doing, you
[1:43:58] know, even the funeral home, right? You
[1:44:00] talk about it. Brother Brandham said,
[1:44:02] "This man, all he could talk about was
[1:44:04] hogs. This is how I raise them. This is
[1:44:06] how I feed them. This is what I feed
[1:44:07] them."
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandon said after a while,
[1:44:09] he interjected. He said, "Isn't there
[1:44:10] more to your life than hogs?
[1:44:16] Isn't there more than hogs?" Oh, church.
[1:44:19] It may not be hogs. That may seem kind
[1:44:21] of ridiculous, but maybe it's something
[1:44:23] else in our life. Isn't there more to
[1:44:25] our life than just work?
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking just the preachers
[1:44:29] today. I'm talking to every one of us.
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; Isn't there more to our life than just
[1:44:33] going to work? Isn't there more to our
[1:44:35] life than driving a truck or working in
[1:44:37] a factory or doing that? Brother said,
[1:44:39] "God didn't put you here to work in a
[1:44:41] factory just alone. He put you here as a
[1:44:44] testimony, a written epistle read of all
[1:44:46] men to live an honorable and decent life
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; and a and a hid consecrated life with
[1:44:51] God so that men would know that Jesus
[1:44:54] Christ still lives and reign. You might
[1:44:55] be a hog raiser, but let me be a
[1:44:57] testifier while I'm raising hogs. Let me
[1:45:00] be a worshipper while I'm in the
[1:45:02] factory. Let me do what God's called me
[1:45:03] to do.
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; Be what God's called me to be.
[1:45:10] Brother Brandon said, "Brothers and
[1:45:11] sisters, let me say this in the name of
[1:45:13] Christ. If you've never been in that
[1:45:15] place, come to him tonight.
[1:45:18] Get into that place.
[1:45:20] When you go home, close the door. Tell
[1:45:24] your husband not to bother you till
[1:45:25] tomorrow. Stay in there.
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; Tell your wife the same thing. Say, "If
[1:45:29] I'm not out of here in the morning, tell
[1:45:30] the boss, I'm not coming to work today."
[1:45:33] Stay in the presence of Christ until
[1:45:36] something happens in your soul. as
[1:45:38] musicians come. Many
[1:45:42] times we we want to practice self-care.
[1:45:44] That's a buzz word today. Self-care. I
[1:45:48] guess there's some element of truth to
[1:45:49] it as there is to most things. You need
[1:45:52] to take care of yourself.
[1:45:54] We practice self-care and we are more I
[1:45:58] guess we recognize more the needs that
[1:46:00] we have in our own self and our bodies
[1:46:02] than any other generation ever did. We
[1:46:04] take care of ourselves.
[1:46:06] Let me tell you what the best kind of
[1:46:08] self-care is. Time in his presence.
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; It's the best kind.
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; Because there will be something from the
[1:46:17] inside begin to come to the outside.
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; See, if we're just trying to change the
[1:46:22] atmosphere of our nature by taking in
[1:46:25] things, that's that might help for a
[1:46:27] while, but it'll never change who you
[1:46:30] are.
[1:46:32] But if you could ever get in the
[1:46:33] presence of the shikina glory, if you
[1:46:36] could ever get in the presence,
[1:46:39] oh my, of the one who created the
[1:46:42] universe,
[1:46:46] just get in his presence.
[1:46:49] He begin to heal you from the inside.
[1:46:55] Begin to take care of you from the
[1:46:57] inside.
[1:47:00] Just just go past the brazen altar. Go
[1:47:03] past the candlesticks to shoot bread.
[1:47:07] Come out of the court of the Gentiles
[1:47:08] into the holy place.
[1:47:11] Don't stop there. Keep moving. Some of
[1:47:13] y'all have come. You've ch your lives
[1:47:15] have changed. You've been sanctified
[1:47:16] your lives. You've done things
[1:47:17] differently. But it's time to go on in.
[1:47:20] It's time to go on in because outside
[1:47:23] you're still dependent on man-made
[1:47:24] light. whether the preacher preaches a
[1:47:26] good sermon, whether or not the people
[1:47:28] are good to you. But you need to go on
[1:47:30] into the Holy of Holies, go inside on
[1:47:33] the inside of the inside where the light
[1:47:36] of the hour is the shikina presence of
[1:47:38] God. Go in and stay there until you are
[1:47:41] changed in his presence, till your life
[1:47:44] begins to bear
[1:47:46] again.
[1:47:49] So, that's what I want to do. How about
[1:47:50] you this morning? Do you love the Lord
[1:47:52] this morning? I'm going to preach to you
[1:47:54] again this afternoon. Kind of take a
[1:47:57] related thought, but not the same. Let's
[1:47:59] bow our heads together.
[1:48:02] Maybe you'd like to enter into his
[1:48:03] presence just for a moment today.
[1:48:12] So, Brother Ben, I need a vacation. We
[1:48:13] all do.
[1:48:15] That's a valuable thing. But right now,
[1:48:18] we have an opportunity
[1:48:20] for time in his presence.
[1:48:26] Ben, I need a new new this or new that
[1:48:28] or new house,
[1:48:31] whatever it is. But right now,
[1:48:38] he has set before you an open door,
[1:48:43] this moment to walk into the Holy of
[1:48:46] Holies.
[1:48:50] Let that veil drop behind you. And Lord,
[1:48:52] it's just you and me now.
[1:48:57] God,
[1:48:59] once you ever go in there, church, you
[1:49:01] want to live there.
[1:49:04] You'll want to live there. There's
[1:49:06] something in your heart that longs for
[1:49:08] that.
[1:49:10] [Music]
[1:49:11] Oh, I don't want to be just an old dead
[1:49:13] stick.
[1:49:15] Tired of living
[1:49:18] up and down and in and out. I want to be
[1:49:20] in the Holy of Holies.
[1:49:26] I want to stay there in your presence
[1:49:28] until something changes.
[1:49:30] Well, I pray that'd be our prayer this
[1:49:32] morning.
[1:49:34] Maybe you can leave this place that
[1:49:35] brother said, "Go and shut your door.
[1:49:38] I'm Lord. I'm ready."
[1:49:43] Hallelujah. You're ready for things to
[1:49:45] be different.
[1:49:47] If you need prayer, the altar's open,
[1:49:49] but let's just all pray together for a
[1:49:50] moment. Heavenly Father,
[1:49:54] Lord, I feel your presence here this
[1:49:56] morning in the sanctuary.
[1:49:59] I thank you so much, Lord.
[1:50:02] Had to fight so hard this morning to
[1:50:04] even get to a place where I could preach
[1:50:06] things that happened. But Lord, I know
[1:50:08] that you're here this morning.
[1:50:12] I know that you're the same yesterday,
[1:50:14] today, and forever.
[1:50:16] I thank you for coming down among us
[1:50:18] once again.
[1:50:21] Lord, take me into the Holy of Holies.
[1:50:26] Let me live there, Lord, where I
[1:50:28] wouldn't do anything that would be
[1:50:30] unpleasing to you because I'd be inside
[1:50:33] where your presence is. I'd be conscious
[1:50:35] of it.
[1:50:37] Oh, grant it. Lord, take me away from
[1:50:40] all the fussing and fighting and
[1:50:41] stewing. Oh, God. Take me in
[1:50:45] to the Holy of Holies.
[1:50:48] Let the door shut behind me, oh God.
[1:50:52] Let me dwell in your presence.
[1:50:55] Grant that for every one of us, Lord.
[1:50:58] Lord, I don't care how long they've been
[1:50:59] a Christian. I pray this morning would
[1:51:01] be a ripening time in the presence of
[1:51:04] God, a blooming time.
[1:51:07] Maybe when they leave here, they say,
[1:51:08] "Well, I haven't I haven't blossomed out
[1:51:10] yet. I don't see the fruit." But if they
[1:51:12] even see a bud, Lord, may they rejoice
[1:51:14] in that and then just stay in your
[1:51:16] presence.
[1:51:18] I pray you'd grant it, Lord.
[1:51:21] It's got to go through a process, but
[1:51:23] may it begin now, Lord, before anything
[1:51:26] else is alive. May your children come
[1:51:28] alive in the presence of God. I pray in
[1:51:32] Jesus name.
[1:51:34] Hallelujah.
[1:51:36] Hallelujah.
[1:51:39] Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[1:51:45] [Music]
[1:51:49] Thank you, Jesus. In the presence of
[1:51:51] Jehovah,

[1:52:02] the king.
[1:52:05] Could you just lift your hands to him
[1:52:06] and sing it this morning? Oh, in the
[1:52:11] presence
[1:52:14] in your presence, Lord. Oh, just forget
[1:52:17] about everything else for just a moment.
[1:52:19] Let me spend time in your presence,
[1:52:21] Lord.
[1:52:23] Hallelujah.
[1:52:26] Oh God Almighty.
[1:52:30] [Music]
[1:52:32] Thank you, Lord Jesus. Oh prince,
[1:52:36] you're the prince of peace.

[1:57:12] distress.

[2:01:43] many appreciated the word of the Lord

[2:01:58] He puts a song of praise in this heart
[2:02:03] of mine. God is good
[2:02:07] all the time
[2:02:10] in the darkest night. His light will
[2:02:14] shine. God is good.
