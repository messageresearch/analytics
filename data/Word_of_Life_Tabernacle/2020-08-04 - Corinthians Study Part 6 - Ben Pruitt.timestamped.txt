[1:21] thank you for joining us today for our
[1:26] study on the book of first corinthians
[1:27] we'll give you guys just a moment if
[1:29] there's a few that want to join us live
[1:30] today
[1:31] if you can't join us live you're more
[1:33] than welcome
[1:34] to join us um later on
[1:37] um we'll have it uploaded to facebook
[1:40] into youtube as well so that you'll be
[1:42] able to watch a little bit later on
[1:44] um i want to go over just a few things
[1:46] that we talked about last time
[1:47] last week just so that we can kind of
[1:51] uh give you a chance to join us today um
[1:55] we looked at verses one through five of
[1:58] chapter two of first corinthians
[2:00] we found that paul did not represent
[2:03] himself as an
[2:04] orator he didn't show himself to be
[2:08] excellent in speech he said i came not
[2:10] to do with excellency in speech
[2:13] we found that apollos on by contrast was
[2:17] an orator he was educated revelated and
[2:20] dedicated if you'd say it that way but
[2:23] he was not the messenger to the age and
[2:25] so we found that you have to
[2:29] always look at not the person that
[2:32] speaks the best
[2:33] but who brings the word to the age and
[2:35] that was paul and apollos was not wrong
[2:38] apollos was a good man and he was a
[2:40] great preacher of the gospel
[2:42] but he was a person who
[2:46] was a carrier of the message he was not
[2:48] the messenger
[2:49] himself and and we've seen that in our
[2:52] day
[2:53] we also found that paul when he came he
[2:54] preached with power
[2:56] and demonstration of the spirit for the
[2:59] effect of
[2:59] changing lives that's why he preached
[3:02] was for the effect of changing lives
[3:06] so let's go into first corinthians
[3:08] chapter two and verse six and before we
[3:10] do let's have a word of prayer
[3:12] heavenly father we thank you for all the
[3:15] things that you've done for us we thank
[3:16] you for your word
[3:18] we thank you for the peace that passes
[3:20] all understanding
[3:21] i pray lord that somehow this would be a
[3:23] blessing to us
[3:24] lord during the week lord maybe as just
[3:27] a little break from our jobs and things
[3:28] that we have to do
[3:30] i pray god that you would help us and
[3:32] keep us in your perfect will
[3:34] lord as we bring these things lord may
[3:36] it be only your word and nothing else
[3:38] i pray for each one that's sick or in
[3:40] need or that would watch this that they
[3:42] would be blessed they would receive what
[3:43] they have need up
[3:44] we pray in jesus name amen
[3:49] first corinthians chapter 2 and verse 6
[3:52] he says paul is paul writing he says how
[3:55] be it
[3:56] we speak wisdom among them that are
[3:58] perfect yet not the wisdom of this world
[4:01] more of the princes of this world
[4:04] that come to naught that word
[4:07] perfect is the greek word this is the
[4:10] next slide the greek word
[4:12] telios which means brought to its end
[4:15] finished wanting nothing necessary to
[4:18] completeness
[4:20] perfect it's consummate human integrity
[4:24] and virtue
[4:25] when it's talking about of men but it
[4:28] also means full grown adult of full age
[4:31] mature and that's the context that
[4:34] paul is bringing in in here is of
[4:38] those that are mature those that who are
[4:39] able to handle it because he later on
[4:41] explains that the corinthians
[4:43] were babies when it comes to these
[4:45] things and
[4:47] he speaks of that also in hebrews how
[4:49] that those that are of the full age
[4:51] those that are mature in christ
[4:53] can receive the deep things of god
[4:56] and so he says we do speak wisdom so
[4:58] he's contrasting this with what he's
[4:59] already told us that
[5:01] he said i come not into you with
[5:02] excellency of speech and my speech and
[5:04] my preaching was not with enticing words
[5:06] of men's wisdom but
[5:08] here he says i come to you
[5:11] we do speak wisdom among them that are
[5:14] perfect
[5:15] we don't speak this wisdom to the world
[5:18] but we speak this wisdom to those who
[5:20] are mature christians
[5:22] he said yet not the wisdom of this world
[5:24] nor of the princes of this world
[5:26] that come to naught so in verse 7 he
[5:29] says but we speak
[5:30] the wisdom of god in a mystery
[5:35] even the hidden wisdom which god
[5:37] ordained before the world
[5:39] unto our glory so this wisdom was not
[5:42] known
[5:43] by the world in general and
[5:46] brother branham says uh something in
[5:48] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[5:49] that i thought was good
[5:51] as we come out of this this phase where
[5:53] paul is talking about
[5:54] how he came to them in fear and
[5:56] trembling and all of these things and
[5:58] brother branham says paul this great
[6:00] intellectual man never tried to express
[6:02] his great theological terms upon the
[6:04] people he
[6:06] humbly accepted the word of the lord and
[6:08] he lived the word
[6:10] so that it expressed through him he
[6:12] lived so godly until they seen jesus
[6:14] christ
[6:15] in him that's what i want to do so much
[6:18] so they wanted his handkerchief to take
[6:20] it and lay it upon the sick
[6:22] he said there is the life of christ so
[6:25] not so much in
[6:26] in the mysteries that paul knew but in
[6:28] the fact that he
[6:29] lived it in such a way until they saw
[6:32] jesus christ
[6:34] in him verse 8 says which none of the
[6:38] princes of this world knew for had they
[6:39] known it
[6:40] they would not have crucified the lord
[6:42] of glory
[6:45] if they had known that
[6:49] he was the lord of glory if they had
[6:50] known this mystery
[6:52] if they had been had insight into this
[6:55] hidden mystery
[6:57] they wouldn't have done what they did
[6:59] but they did it because they didn't know
[7:02] and the fact that they were princes
[7:04] which that word as the next slide
[7:06] princess is
[7:07] arkhan which is a ruler a commander a
[7:10] chief or a leader the fact that they
[7:11] were the leaders or chiefs
[7:13] of the people did not automatically mean
[7:16] that they knew
[7:17] the hidden mystery and this is something
[7:20] again that paul is hitting at that
[7:22] it's not always the wise it's not always
[7:24] the great man it's not always
[7:25] even a great speaker a great orator but
[7:28] someone who knows the hidden mystery
[7:30] if you want to know about christ you're
[7:33] not going to find him in the wisdom of
[7:34] this world you're going to find him
[7:36] in the wisdom that comes from god so
[7:40] brother branham he picks up on this and
[7:42] christ crisis mystery of god revealed
[7:44] again and he goes over these verses that
[7:46] we've went over the last few verses
[7:49] and they he said you said you're wrong
[7:52] about rabbis and preachers there
[7:54] and then he says who crucified him so he
[7:58] reads the scripture and then he kind of
[8:00] comes back at him and he says
[8:02] you say you're wrong about rabbis and
[8:04] preachers well who crucified him it was
[8:05] preachers
[8:06] that did it so just because someone is a
[8:09] preacher doesn't mean
[8:11] that they know this hidden mystery
[8:15] just because someone's a rabbi just
[8:16] because someone says that they know the
[8:18] word just because someone has a youtube
[8:20] program or
[8:21] or television program doesn't mean that
[8:23] they know
[8:24] this hidden mystery but watch their life
[8:27] watch what they do watch how they act
[8:28] among the people
[8:30] and then you'll begin to see do they
[8:31] demonstrate the power of the gospel to
[8:34] change a life
[8:35] that's what you want to look at so
[8:39] so that's the very class that crucified
[8:40] him was rabbis and preachers
[8:43] verse 9 says but as it is written
[8:46] i have not seen nor ear heard neither
[8:49] have entered into the heart of man
[8:52] the things which god hath prepared for
[8:54] them
[8:55] that love him i love this scripture it's
[8:58] one of that i quote constantly
[9:01] i have not seen nor ear heard neither
[9:03] have entered into the heart of man the
[9:05] things which god hath prepared for them
[9:06] to love him that you can't even
[9:08] imagine it hasn't even entered into your
[9:10] imagination
[9:12] what god has done and what he's prepared
[9:15] for those that love him and so
[9:17] and speaking of the things that
[9:20] they didn't know and god still reveals
[9:23] down to the age but now
[9:26] paul takes that and i think it's
[9:27] interesting because
[9:29] paul takes that scripture and he
[9:32] paraphrases it to get the sense and
[9:34] application now there's there are people
[9:36] i will teach you today that it's wrong
[9:38] to do that you can't paraphrase the
[9:40] scripture
[9:40] well if if it's wrong to do that then
[9:42] paul was wrong
[9:43] because paul does it constantly in the
[9:45] new testament he paraphrases
[9:47] he puts the scriptures together brother
[9:49] branham also does that
[9:50] he paraphrases the scripture he takes
[9:52] one scripture and puts it with another
[9:54] scripture
[9:55] um the scripture where he talks about
[9:57] lord i'm with you always even to the end
[9:59] of the world
[9:59] takes one scripture i'll be with you
[10:02] even in you until the end of the world
[10:04] takes one scripture puts it with another
[10:06] scripture and and makes his thought
[10:08] but the thought and the context is the
[10:11] same
[10:11] so this is the original that paul is
[10:13] taking it from isaiah 64 4
[10:16] for since the beginning of the world men
[10:17] have not heard
[10:19] or perceived by the ear neither have the
[10:21] i seen o god beside thee
[10:24] what he has prepared for him that
[10:25] waiteth for him so the sense is the same
[10:28] and we've talked about that before that
[10:30] you can't always go just by
[10:33] did they say the exact words word for
[10:35] word
[10:36] but did they convey the meaning did they
[10:39] convey the meaning and that's what
[10:40] preaching is is conveying the meaning
[10:43] not to find a meaning that's not there
[10:45] but to convey the meaning that's already
[10:47] there
[10:49] so paul does that now
[10:53] brother branham and and i put this in
[10:55] here just kind of as an extra thing but
[10:57] brother branham does talk about that how
[10:59] that these scribes and these ones can
[11:01] miss
[11:02] him and and the world they've not seen
[11:05] they don't know
[11:07] even though they do know the words they
[11:09] know the exact
[11:11] language that was used but they don't
[11:13] know the hidden mystery
[11:15] he says no one can doubt but what the
[11:17] scribes and pharisees and the great
[11:19] scholars of the year 33 a.d this is that
[11:21] was that next slide
[11:23] knew the exact laws of grammar and the
[11:26] exact meanings of the words
[11:27] in which the old testament was written
[11:30] but for all their superb knowledge they
[11:32] missed the revelation
[11:34] of god's promised word manifested in the
[11:37] son
[11:38] now catch those words they missed the
[11:40] revelation
[11:41] of god's promised word manifested in the
[11:43] son and it do you good to go back and
[11:45] listen and or
[11:46] read an exposition of the seven church
[11:48] ages if you go back to where brother
[11:50] branham says this you'll find
[11:52] that he talks about how all these greek
[11:54] scholars and how that they've gone back
[11:55] to the original text and
[11:57] but they can't even agree among
[11:58] themselves about the word
[12:00] even though they have the original text
[12:04] so they're not just using the king james
[12:06] version or whatever version you use but
[12:08] they're using
[12:09] the original text and they still cannot
[12:12] agree one with another and the reason
[12:14] why they can't agree is because it
[12:16] hasn't been revealed to them
[12:18] so brother random tells us that for all
[12:21] the superb knowledge that the scribes
[12:23] and the pharisees had
[12:24] they could not see they did not know the
[12:27] word manifested in the son
[12:29] he said there he was set forth from
[12:31] genesis to malachi
[12:32] with the whole chapter devoted to him in
[12:35] his ministry
[12:37] and yet except for a few who were
[12:39] illuminated by the spirit
[12:41] they missed him entirely
[12:45] the next slide he said but god hath
[12:48] revealed them
[12:49] unto us by his spirit so
[12:52] they missed it having all these
[12:54] advantages being able to read the
[12:56] original greek and the hebrew which is
[12:57] something i've always wanted to be able
[12:59] to do
[13:00] i can go back and look at the
[13:02] translation but
[13:03] i've never been able to read the actual
[13:05] you know read it in the original
[13:06] language
[13:07] it's such a blessing to be able to do
[13:08] that but even though they could do that
[13:10] and they were familiar with the
[13:12] scriptures in a way that couldn't even
[13:13] compare
[13:14] with us today but it was not revealed to
[13:17] them he said but god
[13:18] hath revealed him unto us by his spirit
[13:21] so paul says i'm not relying on my
[13:23] knowledge of the original language
[13:25] but i'm relying on the fact that these
[13:27] things have been revealed to me
[13:29] by the spirit the spirit searcheth all
[13:32] things
[13:33] a the deep things of god the deep things
[13:36] of god
[13:38] and when we look at that we kind of look
[13:40] at that word
[13:41] that that verse is saying the spirit
[13:43] searches all things
[13:45] even the deep things of god that's not
[13:47] actually what he's saying
[13:49] he's saying this in the god's word
[13:51] translation on that next slide has a
[13:52] better
[13:53] translation of it where he says the
[13:55] spirit searches everything especially
[13:58] the deep things of god
[13:59] so when he says yey we might take that
[14:02] wrong but
[14:02] it's drawing your attention to it it's
[14:05] especially the deep things of god so
[14:07] it's not
[14:07] as though the deep things of god were
[14:09] the the limit of what he would do
[14:12] but that's the things that he reveals to
[14:14] us
[14:15] verse 11 for what man
[14:18] knoweth the things of a man save the
[14:21] spirit of a man
[14:23] or the spirit of man which is in him
[14:27] even so the things of god knoweth no man
[14:30] but the spirit of god
[14:35] so he says now we have received verse 12
[14:39] not the spirit of the world but the
[14:41] spirit which is of god
[14:43] that we might know the things that are
[14:45] freely given to us
[14:46] of god and this is dispensation
[14:51] the things that are freely given to us
[14:53] is the things we are granted
[14:56] is it's what it is in the original it's
[14:57] the things which we are granted is the
[14:59] things
[15:00] given to us in our dispensation and and
[15:03] i'm so thankful that we live in the
[15:04] dispensation of the open book and the
[15:06] dispensation
[15:07] of the fullness of times and the
[15:08] dispensation when these things were to
[15:11] be revealed
[15:12] in the dispensation when all of these
[15:14] things would all of these
[15:16] things that were unknown all these loose
[15:17] sins would be tied up so he says we we
[15:20] know the things that are freely
[15:22] given to us of god and i'm so grateful
[15:25] that we can know
[15:27] we don't just have to guess but we can
[15:29] know the things that are freely
[15:32] given to us of god
[15:35] so these are things we can know we don't
[15:38] have to guess at now
[15:41] he says the secret things and this is in
[15:44] deuteronomy 29 29
[15:46] the secret things belong to the lord our
[15:48] god so there are things that god keeps
[15:50] and this is this idea of
[15:51] dispensationalism or
[15:53] the things that are freely given
[15:56] the secret things belong unto the lord
[15:57] our god but those things which are
[15:59] revealed belonging to us
[16:01] so the things that are revealed we have
[16:02] a right to know how are we going to know
[16:04] them
[16:05] only by the spirit of god those things
[16:07] which are revealed belonging to us
[16:09] and to our children forever that we may
[16:11] do all the words of this law how are we
[16:13] going to know what to do
[16:15] unless we have the word and so he says
[16:18] there are things that are secret
[16:20] many things in that time were secret
[16:22] that are now revealed many things that
[16:24] were in the old testament were revealed
[16:25] in the new testament
[16:26] and now we live in the time of the
[16:29] fullness of the revelation because
[16:31] the bible tells us that he reveals his
[16:33] secret this is the next slide
[16:35] he said surely the lord god will do
[16:37] nothing but he revealeth his secret
[16:39] unto his servants the prophets so he
[16:42] says before he does
[16:43] anything he's going to reveal this
[16:45] secret the thing that's been held
[16:48] the thing that we didn't know he reveals
[16:50] that to his servants the prophets
[16:52] then in revelation 10 7 he says but in
[16:55] the days of the voice of the seventh
[16:56] angel when he shall begin to sound
[16:58] the mystery of god should be finished as
[17:00] he hath declared
[17:02] to who to his servants the prophets
[17:07] so how we gonna know the secret we're
[17:08] gonna know the secret
[17:12] by the spirit as he reveals it to us
[17:15] through the prophets
[17:16] i hope we understand that
[17:20] verse 13
[17:24] he says which things also we speak not
[17:27] in the words which man's wisdom
[17:30] speaketh or teaches teacheth but which
[17:33] the holy ghost teacheth
[17:35] comparing spiritual things with
[17:37] spiritual now this is important
[17:39] and we're going to go down right to the
[17:41] end of the chapter today so we'll be
[17:43] just a few more minutes but he says
[17:46] comparing spiritual things
[17:48] was spiritual and this is the idea of
[17:51] comparing
[17:52] look at that next slide if you would
[17:53] then the spiritual things with
[17:55] spirituals the idea
[17:57] of comparing one part of the revelation
[17:59] with another
[18:01] so it's the revelation of the gospel
[18:04] with what the jews had the discoveries
[18:07] of the new testament with the types and
[18:08] prophecies of the old the comparing of
[18:10] matters of revelation with or that's
[18:13] what we compare we don't compare
[18:16] matters of revelation with matters of
[18:18] science
[18:19] things supernatural with things natural
[18:21] and common that's the wrong measure
[18:23] but we compare spiritual things with
[18:25] spiritual and so many people get mixed
[18:28] up by this today they say well if i
[18:29] could prove that the cloud
[18:31] scientifically was a supernatural cloud
[18:36] then i would believe no you don't
[18:38] compare spiritual things
[18:41] with natural things you compare
[18:43] spiritual things
[18:44] with spiritual things you compare
[18:47] the events and the signs of the
[18:49] messenger they are with the scripture
[18:50] spiritual things with spiritual things
[18:52] not spiritual things with
[18:55] so and this is matthew henry that says
[18:58] it's written several hundred years ago
[18:59] but it's still good
[19:00] he said the comparing of matters of
[19:02] revelation with matters of science
[19:04] things supernatural with things natural
[19:05] and common is going by a wrong measure
[19:09] spiritual things when brought together
[19:12] will help to illustrate one another but
[19:15] if the principles listen to this
[19:18] if the principles of human art and
[19:20] science
[19:21] are to be made a test of revelation
[19:24] we shall certainly judge a myth
[19:26] concerning it
[19:28] and the things contained in it that's
[19:30] what people are trying to do today
[19:31] you don't judge spiritual things
[19:35] by human art and science we do not make
[19:39] human art and science a test of
[19:41] revelation
[19:42] but revelation is compared with previous
[19:45] revelation
[19:46] you compare what one prophet said with
[19:48] what another prophet said
[19:50] not with what scientists say all right
[19:54] so brother branham says now remember and
[19:56] this is in the sixth seal
[19:58] he said now remember he said i've always
[20:00] taught that in the mouth of two or three
[20:01] witnesses let every word be established
[20:04] he said in the scripture just like you
[20:05] can't take one scripture and prove
[20:07] nothing
[20:08] lest there is something else that goes
[20:10] with it and and brother branham takes an
[20:12] almost
[20:13] funny illustration it's not funny but
[20:15] it's amusing
[20:16] he said see i can take one scripture and
[20:18] say judas went and hung himself
[20:20] i can take another one and say you go do
[20:22] the same
[20:24] so that's two scriptures but i'm not
[20:27] comparing them accurately because he
[20:28] said but see it won't blend in
[20:32] with the rest of it it won't blend in
[20:36] with the rest of it it has to blend in
[20:38] and you'll find brother branham taught
[20:39] us that
[20:40] all the way through the scripture from
[20:42] genesis to revelation it's got to blend
[20:44] in the whole thing
[20:47] verse 14 he said but the natural man
[20:50] receiveth not the things of the spirit
[20:52] of god
[20:53] so this is where jesus said you must be
[20:56] born again
[20:57] because he said if you're not born again
[20:59] you can't see the kingdom and to see we
[21:01] know is to understand
[21:03] he said the natural man receiveth not
[21:04] the things of the spirit of god
[21:07] for they are foolishness unto him
[21:09] neither can he know them because they
[21:11] are spiritually discerned
[21:14] now brother branham tells us
[21:17] he says there's or actually this is um
[21:21] from a commentary the cambridge
[21:23] commentary it says there's but little
[21:25] analogy between mental and spiritual
[21:27] discernment or processes
[21:30] which the apostle has been contrasting
[21:31] through the whole this chapter
[21:33] so let's take it like this two different
[21:37] ways
[21:37] of looking at things natural discernment
[21:41] is a result of knowledge
[21:42] investigation and argument that's how
[21:45] you
[21:46] you decide what something is we we look
[21:49] at the world and and we see
[21:51] well this is a desk how do we know this
[21:52] is a desk well that's the result of
[21:54] knowledge
[21:54] investigation and argument someone could
[21:56] tell me that it is
[21:59] i could use it as that i could
[22:01] investigate and see if that's the case
[22:03] and we could argue about it and see who
[22:06] has the better argument as to what it is
[22:08] and i said no it's a table i say it's a
[22:10] desk it's a table
[22:12] my argument is what has uh drawers i can
[22:15] pull out and there's things i can do
[22:16] with it i couldn't do
[22:17] with just a table so it's a desk so
[22:20] that's how you come to a conclusion of
[22:22] what something is
[22:23] which is what discernment is it's the
[22:26] result of knowledge investigation and
[22:28] argument
[22:30] but the faculties which produce this
[22:32] spiritual discernment
[22:34] are sharpened by self-discipline
[22:36] humility communion with god
[22:38] love of god love of the brethren that's
[22:41] not how you come to knowledge
[22:42] naturally but it is how you come to
[22:45] knowledge spiritually and too many times
[22:46] we try
[22:47] to get spiritual knowledge spiritual
[22:50] discernment
[22:52] through natural processes and you can't
[22:54] do that you want to know more about the
[22:55] scripture love god more
[22:57] you want to know more about the
[22:58] scripture learn how to
[23:00] love the brothers learn self-discipline
[23:03] learn humility
[23:04] learn communion with god
[23:08] verse 15
[23:12] but he that is spiritual judgeth all
[23:14] things
[23:16] he himself is judged of no man
[23:20] he judges all things but he judged
[23:24] but he is judged by no man that next
[23:27] slide is
[23:28] john wesley he said but the spiritual
[23:29] man he that hath the spirit
[23:31] discerneth all the things of god
[23:33] wherever we've been speaking
[23:36] yet he himself is discerned that's how
[23:38] he translate the word
[23:39] translates the word judged he himself is
[23:42] discerned by no man no natural men
[23:46] they don't understand what he is nor
[23:48] what he says and we know that that
[23:50] brother branham taught us that as well
[23:53] first corinthians 2 16 for who hath
[23:55] known the mind of the lord that you may
[23:56] instruct him
[23:58] in other words how are you going to how
[24:00] are you going to get into the mind of
[24:02] god
[24:02] how he thinks why he thinks about what
[24:05] what he does
[24:06] who hath known the mind of the lord that
[24:08] he may instruct him
[24:09] but we have the mind of christ
[24:14] we have the mind of christ what a
[24:15] blessing that is
[24:17] how do we have the mind of christ by the
[24:18] spirit of god
[24:21] brother branham says it this way and i'm
[24:23] closing
[24:26] we're almost finished but the member
[24:27] says here's the secret of this
[24:30] the word is in the bride as it was in
[24:33] mary
[24:35] the word is in the bride as it was in
[24:37] mary
[24:38] the bride has the mind of christ for she
[24:41] knows what he once done
[24:43] with the word who can know the mind of
[24:46] god
[24:47] who hath known the mind of the lord that
[24:49] he may instruct him so paul is telling
[24:51] the corinthians don't rest
[24:53] in your great men don't rest in your
[24:55] natural ability don't rest
[24:57] in the names of these great men
[25:00] paul and and peter and apollos and even
[25:03] christ
[25:04] but rest in the fact that you have the
[25:06] spirit of god which
[25:08] gives you the mind of god the mind of
[25:12] christ
[25:12] and that means the word is in you you
[25:14] have the mind of christ
[25:16] and the spirit of christ is in you to
[25:17] know what he wants done with the word
[25:20] and that's important because it's one
[25:21] thing to know the word it's one thing to
[25:23] know the letter
[25:24] it's another thing to know what he wants
[25:25] done with the word and this is a problem
[25:27] in the corinthian church because they
[25:29] know the word
[25:30] and they're a real church a real bunch
[25:33] of believers
[25:34] that they are a real group of believers
[25:36] but they don't know how to apply the
[25:38] word to their everyday lives
[25:40] and that's what we're going to get into
[25:42] as we move on to the book of first
[25:43] corinthians
[25:44] he says she performs the command of the
[25:47] word in his name
[25:49] for she has thus saith the lord
[25:52] what a blessing that is what a promise
[25:54] that is to us as the bride of christ
[25:56] he said then the word is quickened by
[25:58] the spirit
[26:00] and it comes to pass like a seed that is
[26:03] planted and watered
[26:04] it comes to full harvest serving its
[26:07] purpose
[26:09] and i'm so grateful that we serve a god
[26:12] who is not just a dead letter but it's
[26:14] something that can
[26:16] be a purpose in our lives that can
[26:17] produce a life that is lived that can be
[26:20] worthy
[26:21] of the gospel it can be an example to
[26:23] our brothers and that can be changed
[26:25] from what we were
[26:26] to what we can be today to live under
[26:29] the blessings under the fountain of
[26:30] god's blessings
[26:32] let's pray heavenly father thank you for
[26:35] once again meeting with us today
[26:37] i pray god that you would just move and
[26:40] and anoint these words to our hearts as
[26:42] we go throughout our day
[26:44] thank you for all that you do we ask it
[26:46] in jesus name
[26:47] amen god bless you thank you for
[26:49] watching today
