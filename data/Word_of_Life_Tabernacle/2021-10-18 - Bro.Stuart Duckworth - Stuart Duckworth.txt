this go to that which is it is intended lord we just ask that you bless everything that's said and done bless your word as it would go forth bless your people tonight we pray in jesus name amen do you love the lord amen if we could we'll turn the scriptures to jeremiah 8 and 22. amen that's certainly happy to be here tonight and i miss my family they're all sick with the covert and i've tried to just to stay away from or not tried i have i've been at work all week and when they first got it and just stayed away from them and kind of sacrificed so we could be here tonight and just have a business to run and so we're just trying to keep our distance so nobody else gets sick but amen we believe god is our healer amen god takes care of his people amen amen jeremiah 8 and 22 says here jeremiah speaking he said is there no bomb in gilead is there no physician there why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered amen you can be seated this evening amen so it's it's god's desire for his people to be healed amen for our our health to be recovered amen god god being the god of restoration amen and god wants to bring you up out of the condition that you would be in amen to raise you up and man god doesn't just amen expect us just to deal with a sickness or a condition but god god has a desire to raise his people up i mean he doesn't want us to be sick but he wants us to be be healed and he has provided our healing amen i'm just going to try to take my time tonight i only got about 19 pages of notes so we'll just take our time and and man if we get worked up if we get worked up if we don't we don't amen the word is the word amen the book of john 3 john first chapter second verse it says beloved i wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health even as thy soul prospers so again it's it's the will of god for you to be well it's not the will of god for you just to deal with your sickness or deal with your condition amen but he wants us he wants us to be well amen and but we must have faith not just hope that you can be well but you got to be positive of it you got to be positive that god wants me to be healed that god god doesn't want me just to stay in the condition that i'm in amen but god god wants to raise me up god wants to raise us up man so you've got to believe that you've got to be positive of it believe that it's god's will amen and i believe i believe that there is a liberation for the people of god in this hour amen i believe we can look into the word and we can see who god is we can see what god has provided for us and it brings the liberation it brings a liberation from our condition and from the symptoms around us and you just think about symptoms you know and you can think about you know if you catch something you know and you can you can look and maybe you got you know just a little headache or something just say you got covered let's just start there because we know that that's that's kind of what we're dealing i got a little headache you know and a little coughing but there's all these other symptoms amen but you don't have to look at all the other symptoms and and just assume that you're going to take on all those symptoms you don't have to accept that you don't have to look in your condition or whatever your situation may be and say well this is going to happen it'll lead to this and lead to that and then you don't have to accept that i mean you don't have to look at the symptoms and just take it upon yourself but take the word of god take the deliverance and when there's a liberation for the people of god tonight we don't have to be bound and subject to every symptom of this age to every symptom of every sickness amen there's a healing that has been provided there's there's a way out amen amen philippians 4 19 but my god shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by christ jesus do you love that tonight you love the word tonight amen and when god heals us and when god does something for us we ought to give him praise amen when god does something for us it ought to make us want to live for him that much more amen because god god desires you to be prosperous he desires you to be in health even as our soul prospereth amen you don't have to be subject to the wowzy wisely woes and and the in the discouragements of life being god wants you to be happy god wants you to have a prosperous life and then god when god brings out when he when he brings healing when he brings health to you amen we ought to live for him that much more we all we ought to give him praise when he does something for us amen when he when when he does something for us we ought to want to live for him that much more we were put on this earth to be a witness think of that tonight to be a witness of the goodness a goodness of the power of almighty god amen we ought to believe for testimonies we ought to believe for heal and we ought to believe for for god to give us things because god desires to have a prosperous journey amen we're we're here to be witnesses of his goodness amen we were born to serve him and live for him amen so here the scripture that we read so here the jeremiah the prophet was commanded by god to stand at the gate of the city and ask the question is there no bomb is there no position why he asked the question why is the health of my people not recovered but it wasn't that god hadn't provided it because god has always provided for the needs of his people god has always given the best to his people but here the prophet standing at the gate of the city there amen trying to bring attention to the people of what god had given them and then trying to stir up their minds amen as peter said by way of remembrance to try to stir up their pure minds to awaken them amen to to awaken their minds to what god had given them to what god had provided and then the bible says that if if my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and pray and turn from their wicked way i will hear from heaven and i will heal their land amen so there is a healing for the people of god god has provided it we must humble ourselves in his presence in in the message balm and gilead brother branham says here he says the word why god asks that question and when god has made a way for people to escape danger to escape sickness or troubles or disasters provides a way of escape and the people turn it down refuse it then god asks why why what's the reason that you don't accept it amen and god god has always provided for his people amen whatever the need would be he gives him the very best he said in his word i am the lord that healeth thee from all thy diseases and all thy sicknesses i'm the god that delivers you from all your troubles amen and tonight this this evening he alone he alone is able amen to redeem us from the hand of the enemy and then he provides his the very best he provides a way of escape for his people amen but if we if we reject and refuse it that's not on him that's on us amen so he has provided a way of escaping this hour and his word and his grace always provides the very best everything that we would have need need of being his people amen in this salary think of what he's given us he's given us the greatest message that's ever struck the face of the earth and then he's brought to our attention amen that we are the bride amen he's brought to our attention that we are to be caught up in the rapture amen and not only that but he provides to us rapturing grace he provides to us rapturing power he doesn't he doesn't point us to something without giving us and then the power and that that which inside of us that which we would need he provides the faith he provides the power he provides that we which we would have needed to be raptured and to take a body change aren't you thankful for that now aren't you thankful for the message aren't you thankful for what god has provided for us in this hour but we as his people we must humble ourselves under his mighty hand amen but to refuse to reject and to refuse amen to serve the living god in this hour you would have to accept something false right and then there would have to be something else that would take that place because god creates in man a thirst god creates them in manna thirst to worship him and then to desire him and that thirst can never be quenched by false religion and the pleasures of sin amen those things will never bring healing in your life amen by god in this hour amen to you and i this evening he offers faith he offers peace he offers joy in the holy ghost fullness of joy god offers that amen the world can never give you that but god offers it to you and i am only the spirit of god can give you eternal peace and satisfaction and he alone amen can fulfill that desire and need we would have that which he placed in us only he himself can fulfill that the world will never satisfy that hunger though we would try though there would be some false religion false god it can never satisfy can never bring that peace that god can give you oh accept him in this hour amen don't refuse him don't refuse the cure don't re don't refuse the bomb don't refuse the physician the medicine that he's given in this hour the message is bomb and many sentences very best amen and just as jeremiah appointed the people to god and the and the one god who could bring healing a prophet in this day has pointed us to a living god to a living christ not some some relic amen not some empty relic amen we're not looking to an empty tomb tonight we're not i'm well we are looking to an empty tomb we're not looking to a dead god tonight we're looking to a god that they come out of the tomb we're looking to a god that's a living god we are looking to an empty tomb but even in that you could go to the very tomb where jesus was at you could go to that very place and there would be no virtue in it amen you could go you could go to sunset mountain you could go to all these places and we know what god did there we know what god did there but there's no virtue in that brother branham didn't point us back to those places though god though they would be special to us though those important things happened there amen but the god amen that that was there amen the god that was on the mountain the god that was in the tomb that come out of the tomb that god must live in you amen that god that that same power must be in you and i that living god must be in the midst of the church tonight he must be in our services it can't be some dead false religion amen but it's got to be life-giving it's got to be life-flowing amen so the prophet of the hour didn't point us to something that couldn't heal us some empty relic but he pointed us to a living god he pointed us to the god that could open the word in this hour they could open the seals and then they could give you an identification of who you are of who he is what his will is amen to he he he's given us his very best i feel like moses and the stuttering problem sometime we all got our problems don't we that water don't fall over amen god has given us his very best i believe that in this hour amen the prophet jeremiah wasn't he wasn't pointing the people to himself but he was he was pointing them to a bomb to the physician and the prophet in this hour didn't point us to himself he didn't point us to an empty relic but he pointed us to a god someone that could bring complete healing in our hearts and lives first timothy 3 16. without controversy great is the mystery of godliness for god was manifested in the flesh scene of angels preached on in the world believed on in the world and received up in the glory and brother branham says here he said god himself so now jesus was god's manifestation of his own being on earth unfolding himself into a human being to take away sin and to make a way for sickness to be healed and he said and if there is no divine healing there is no resurrection of the dead it is the earnest of your resurrection do you believe that tonight and then jesus was god's manifestation of his own being on earth and if there is no divine healing there's no healing for the people of god then there's no resurrection of these bodies right so healing if you believe in the resurrection there's healing for your body here tonight there's healing there's divine healing and divine healing is the very down payment if you've ever been healed if you've ever received healing it's a very down payment it's the earnest that god will resurrect these bodies that god will change these bodies you can get sick and you can get healed and you can get sick and you can get healed again but there's coming and then there's coming amen a complete healing of these bodies or we'll never be sick again amen but the healing that god provides it's only a shadow it's an earnest of what is coming divine healing is a down payment that we will be raised up one day that we will have a new body one like unto his own glorious body and jesus being the manifestation of god what he came in flesh to do what to make a way to make a way for you and i that we could be healed amen to take away sin to take away sickness jesus came god manifested himself in flesh to take that away for you and i amen so we got the down payment we've got the word we've got the down payment we've got the spirit of god and then the word it says he was wounded for my transgressions you got the down payment tonight and then you you've got you've got the earnest money to get what you have need of tonight and then go back to the word amen he was wounded for my transgressions he was bruised for my iniquity and then by stripes i'm here we've got the down payment tonight amen have faith tonight that healing is yours amen whether whether it be for your soul or your body your mind whatever it would be and then in my spirit we have the earnest of the body change amen if you have the earnest have you had that holy ghost within you tonight amen you have turned heavenward amen you're no longer subject to the world but you're subject to the word and if you're subject to the word you're beneficiary tonight you're subject to the power you're subject to that that word being manifest in you you have that earnest and then you have turned heavenward amen you have the earnest of the rapture in you tonight by the holy ghost amen and brother branham says here he says in baum and gillian he said there is a bomb in jesus tonight in the name of jesus christ there is a bomb whatever you ask the father in my my name that i'll do he said there's a balm in gilead in my name they shall cast out evil spirits they'll lay their hands on the sick and they shall recover he said there's a bomb in gilead if you cannot get rid of your drinking of your gambling and that evil spirit that's making you and then there's a deliverance for the people of god here this morning we have been commissioned to cast out devils and lay hands on the sick and what's the bible say and they shall recover amen we've been commissioned ain't meant to cast satan out we've been commissioned to cast him out of our homes out of the lives of our family we've been we've been commissioned as the church of god and god is here to back up that commission amen we've been commissioned to lay hands on the sick those that would be feeble those that will be near death we've been commissioned amen by almighty god we've been given the power amen and jesus has given us the power but you've got to have the faith you've got to have the faith you've got to have the man of faith the holy ghost inside you to make it operate amen but i believe we've got that man among us tonight i believe we've got him in our midst and our hearts amen if we want to operate the word god has commissioned us and god is here to honor that commission god has to honor his word he's here to back it up we don't have to be bound by sickness you don't have to live in your condition but god wants to raise you up church amen we don't have to be bound by sin sickness by unbelief by the spirit of the day by the spirit of laodicea amen but god has made a way to where we don't have to be bound amen you can be free we can be free there's a bomb amen for our sickness there's a bomb for everything that we would have need of amen in the sun the sun has made us free jesus was manifested in the flesh god was manifested in the flesh to come and make us free amen this comes to you tonight without money there's nothing that you could do to ever purchase it there's nothing you could ever do to merit it but it came without money it came without price it's free to you it's grace to you amen but you've got to believe it and accept it as for you amen and whom the son is made free is free and he's able to make you free from the dominion of sin and unbelief in this hour that you can have faith that you can have faith in what god has promised you i mean he's given us this his word in this hour amen so there's a bomb amen and god is our physician amen brother brenham said there's an inoculation this word inoculation i believe that there's an inoculation that has been provided in this hour and that word inoculation it says the action of immunizing someone against the disease by introducing infective material microorganisms or vaccine into the body amen so when we become inoculated or vaccinated and i don't care tonight whether you've been vaccinated you want to you don't want to you want to wear a mask you don't want to wear masks i don't care but i just thought these things were interesting that it lays in the message i just want to pick up on this thought for just a little bit so there's an inoculation so when we become inoculated or vaccinated a portion of that sickness is introduced into your bloodstream and it exposes you to that sickness just enough so your body will build a certain immunity to that and potentially fight off that certain disease that virus or that sickness and then we understand these things the brother random says here he said now medicine has to be tested and i thought this was interesting and again i don't care one way or the other i thought about getting it myself and you think not but it's just a personal choice so i'm not preaching against it or for it okay so you just i'm going to read this quote though and i thought it was so interesting he said first they find a toxin and that they think for that's for some ailment he said they tried on guinea pigs and they take the toxin after the science has worked on it for a long time and they shoot it into a little guinea pig and they watch his reaction and if it doesn't hurt the little guinea pig then they use it on human beings he said but medicine is a chance to take for some medicines it will help one human being but but it might kill another we understand these things that's nothing nothing new it might have been in that day but we understand these things one person could take something and it might not be good for somebody else amen so he said so you have to watch that he said because that sometimes you must be sure to know what you are doing and let the doctor that knows how to give it give it to you someone that you got confidence in and so so when man makes a medicine it can help some but might kill somebody else our bodies are different and we all have we we all have different types of reactions amen to the same medicine we can have different types of reactions and he said if you take something you need to have confidence that it will work and then it's been tested and even though even though something would have been tested because it's man-made it will never be 100 effective it won't work every single time amen but i believe tonight i believe god has provided an inoculation amen it is the ultimate remedy it's something that i can have full confidence in i mean if you're going gonna take something have faith in it have confidence in it it's 100 percent effective to you and i tonight that which god has provided there's no 99.999 chance amen but it's 100 amen it's 100 percent what god has given us in this hour jesus said i am the way the truth and the life i've got confidence in that i've got confidence and not in the shed blood of the lamb of god i've got confidence in the life-giving flow amen i believe tonight that there's power in the blood there's power in that inoculation of that life if you'll let it come into you there ain't no 99 chance but it's 100 effective it's the ultimate what god provided us it's a very creative blood of god amen to take away sin to take away sickness to take away doubt it's the ultimate cure for you and i that's what god has provided us that's the balm that he provided us you love the lord tonight it's the very creative blood of god brother branham says here and do you now believe he says all right come sir do you now believe everybody believe do you love him with all your heart do you believe me to be god's prophet i'm just a man but he's just using this way i see something in a bottle it's blood so this man's in a prayer line here he said there's one two three 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 bottles of blood it said you've had 17 blood transfusions your anemia is that right and you come from another country arkansas i mean we're from another country you didn't know that did you amen we're just we're we're different than everybody else you come from another country arkansas is that right go home and finish you got a blood blood transfusion from calvary now which will last you god bless you and make you well amen god is your healer tonight amen amen there's medicines that we can take and it no doubt can be helpful and i'm not against that but god is our healer tonight i've got i've got faith i've got trust i've got confidence the very god the god of the bible amen come and spoke to us in this day he come through a prophet may saying made things so clear to us he made things so plain to us that we can have a blood transfusion if you're anemic if you're a diabetic if you've got leukemia god can come down the very creative blood can give you a brand new bloodstream god can come down and bring a healing that's the god we serve tonight that's the god we serve amen you got a blood transfusion from calvary amen do you love him tonight i looked at that word up anemia and it says it is a decrease in the total amount of red blood cells or hemoglobin in the blood or a lowered ability of the blood to carry oxygen the symptoms of of anemia are fatigue weakness pale skin cold hands and and feet dizziness reduced immunity more prone you're more prone to affections and shortness of breath oh my if we could just spiritualize that for a little bit amen maybe you're getting a little weak in faith or not there's a transfusion from calvary amen maybe you got a little cold on god and man maybe you're getting a little wore out from the journey and man laodicea's got you a little pale look him and then you got no direction in your life you're so dizzy and then your immune system is down the things and then the things that you would never do but never find yourself doing you find yourself doing them and letting it creep back into your life but god is able to bring life back into the church tonight and then from calvary there's there's a transfusion that we can partake of tonight and there's a healing flow and then god is able to bring life amen into the blood into the blood that will last he's able to bring life and revival back into the church back into the believer brother branham says here in faith he said in the blood he the the bloods while we're redeemed that's why that's what the matter with the church is tonight it's an anemic condition it needs a blood transfusion from calvary and an old-fashioned baptism of the holy ghost back into the church again hellfire and brimstone priests so it's scorching the coattails of the believers and we didn't say unbelievers he said believers am in the preaching of the word fires us up because it's moving a little bit he said amen that's true what we need today is an old time saint paul's revival in the bible holy ghost back again correctly though what we need is some preachers that'll get out and preach the truth of the thing amen to the blood transfusion is available to you and i this evening if we need it amen in our watered down gospel never help nobody amen and water in the blood will actually hurt you amen well i don't want no water downward i want somebody to give it to me straight amen i i want the thing given to me straight i want to know where i stand with god amen we need a holy ghost gospel it'll come down and change the way we live it'll make us act different live different walk different and then it's a more watered-down gospel someone'll water down preach it'll never do that you'll stay the same you'll stay exactly like you are remember that it takes the truth it takes the fullness of the thing am going to bring revival back in the church i'm going to take that anemic condition away from you away from your worship away from you to make you different make your worship different to make you live different act different i'm getting a little worked up here amen there's a transfusion amen that'll bring the spirit of god it'll bring the fire back in the church amen that's what we need amen that's what that's what that's what's available to us amen it'll change us amen amen there's there's only one one cure tonight for the sickness that's that's actually the leading cause of death and that's not covered it's not cancer it's not heart disease but it's it's sin sickness it's unbelief it'll take all that away this transfusion will take all that away amen that blood that medicine that bomb that god's provided it will change your life it's been tested it's been time tested and this medicine is unlike anything the world can give but is the inoculation from heaven the holy ghost in fire and it will burn every bit of disease every desire for sin out of a man's heart amen amen brother branham says here he said now when doctors investigate medicine for their patients it's tried by a guinea pig but when god wanted to give a test for the human race he never inoculated a guinea pig he inoculated his son the lord jesus took the toxin of god's holy spirit and his action on earth proves what it was when they spit on him he prayed for their forgiveness when he was riled upon he rowed not back it showed that the toxin held when they killed him and he died on the cross bleeding and bleeding he was praying for their forgiveness the toxin kept good then finally a roman spear embalmed his body by smashing into his heart and blood and water poured out they said now it's gone he's give up the spirit his brother said the earth shook he died until the sun would quit shining he died until the stars refused to shine he died until the earth was so black you could feel it he died and went to the lowest regions of hell bearing our sins i'm going to keep reading this you could go you could not go deeper in hell than what he went you could not suffer harder than he suffered you could not die any harder than he died but brother on that first easter morning the toxin went to work it broke the seals of death it smashed the devil in the face and it rolled the stone and the son of the living god lived again he's alive forevermore the toxin work and god put it on his own son not someone else but god came himself in his own son to prove it that it would work and god was made flesh and dwelt among us that's how god was in christ god come and took the toxin himself in a human body that he created himself the son of god and he lived in that and he took the toxin and it proved that it held amen and i believe it if it worked for him it'll work for you and i it'll do the same for you and you and i if you'll take it if you won't refuse it but if you'll take it it'll do the same thing and you talk about conditions brother brahma said nobody could die harder than he died nobody could have sinned lower than he ascended into hell and think about those symptoms think about those conditions yet it held it brought him out of those conditions amen in the hour of temptation it held amen in the hour of persecution it held in the face of persecution it held in the face of death and hell the toxin worked amen it broke the seal of death itself amen it rolled that very stone back that toxin that power that quickening life the same quickening power that comes in you and i that same inoculation amen jesus was inoculated that with that with by himself he received the same thing that same quickening power is in you and i by the holy ghost it'll keep you it'll hold you i don't know how long i've been preaching ephesians 4 30 it says and grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby you are sealed unto the day of redemption amen that's sealed it's the keeping power of god amen god is sealed god is sealed in and satan is sealed out it's 100 percent effective satan the disease the disease of laodicea amen is sealed out and god is sealed in that fire of god is sealed in amen and god is able by the transfusion of calvary the inoculation of heaven to preserve you and i to keep us clean to seal us to hold us in this hour amen it will fight off the bacteria of leo to see on the sickness from a lukewarm condition amen amen it'll keep you in this hour there's a pill you can take amen there's a pill you can take we'll just keep on going with this thought that's all right i wish i was a little better prepared because i feel like it could be so much better amen but just this thought there's a pill you can take and brother branham says here he said if today if somebody could come around here and say i'll give you a little peel and that'll absolutely inoculate you from every hydrogen bomb that will ever fall and you'll live here on earth for ten thousand years through millenniums and everything else and you'll live here through that he said why you'd rush mercy to get it and tonight if there was such a pill in a physical form material form it could be given he said but i'm telling you tonight that the gospel of the lord jesus christ will inoculate you from sin and death and preserve you forever in christ jesus through the ages to come if you'll come upon the basis of the shed blood amen there's appeal that we can take tonight amen i believe i'm associated with some people that took that pill even it's the gospel of jesus christ and paul said for i am not ashamed of the gospel for it of christ for it is the power it is the power of god under salvation to everyone that believeth amen don't be afraid to take it tonight amen don't be ashamed and then it won't make you crazy but it'll put you in your right mind it'll make you live different it'll make you act different and it'll give you the power of god upon your life amen you'll be living epistles amen you'll be the word made flesh you'll be living epistles reading known of all men the holy ghost dwelling in you to make the word live amen it's the power of god of salvation to you can be clean you can be washed by the washing of the water of the word amen healing is here the powers here deliverance is here you can have revival the powers available to you
