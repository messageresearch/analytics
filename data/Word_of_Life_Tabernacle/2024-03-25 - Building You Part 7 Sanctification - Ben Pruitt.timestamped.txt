[47:34] Peter chapter 1 1 Peter chapter 1 and
[47:37] verse
[47:38] 13 we'll read down through verse
[47:44] 16 first Peter
[47:49] 1:13 says wherefore gird up the loins of
[47:52] your mind be sober and hope to the end
[47:57] for the grace that is to be brought unto
[47:59] you at the revelation of Jesus
[48:03] Christ as obedient children not
[48:06] fashioning yourselves according to the
[48:08] former lust or that's desires your
[48:10] former desires and your
[48:13] ignorance but as he which hath called
[48:15] you is Holy so be holy in all manner of
[48:20] conversation that word conversation the
[48:21] King James is your your manner of Life
[48:24] your lifestyle because it is written be
[48:27] holy for I am Holy me you believe he's
[48:31] holy today amen you may be seated Lord
[48:35] that his Blessing to the
[48:37] word I want to speak to us today on
[48:40] sanctification want to say I appreciate
[48:43] uh the people who come and worked as
[48:44] well if you get a chance go and look at
[48:46] the at the uh side of the church where
[48:48] we did some work over there it looks
[48:49] really nice appreciate you doing that I
[48:53] heard a story of a young man who was uh
[48:56] in Russia and a priest who had uh been
[49:00] trying to get the kids interested in
[49:01] coming to church and he couldn't get
[49:03] them to come and so he started handing
[49:05] out candy and that's always a good
[49:06] program to get kids to come to church so
[49:09] he started handing out candy and there
[49:11] was this particular young man uh that uh
[49:14] kept coming back for the candy he'd take
[49:16] the candy and he'd run off in the field
[49:18] and eat it and they were really poor in
[49:20] the peasants in Russia and so he uh he
[49:24] got him to come he kind of coaxed him
[49:25] into the church and got him to where he
[49:28] could recite scripture and at one point
[49:30] the boy got up and recited all four
[49:32] gospels the entire gospels from memory
[49:36] and so he was well taught and the priest
[49:38] had taught him well about those things
[49:41] and uh he was able to do that uh years
[49:44] later that boy became the premier of
[49:47] Russia his name was Nikita
[49:49] kushev and Kush had become the man when
[49:52] they sent the Cosmonaut you remember to
[49:54] the moon and they looked up there and
[49:56] they said we've been then we orbited the
[49:58] Earth and they said there's no
[50:00] God the same boy that recited all four
[50:04] gospels is the same one that said
[50:06] there's no God learning isn't enough to
[50:11] save us it takes more than learning it
[50:14] takes more than legalism it takes the
[50:17] supernatural work of the Holy Spirit In
[50:20] Our Lives to make us live as
[50:23] Christians and and and so God has to do
[50:25] that and there's things that we can do
[50:29] or will do because we are Christians but
[50:31] it takes that Supernatural work to clean
[50:34] us up it takes the blood to save from
[50:36] sin aren't you glad for that today it
[50:39] still takes the blood to save from sin
[50:42] like these are just a little bit too
[50:43] loud it still takes the blood do you
[50:45] believe that the blood is still
[50:47] effective today he's still the same
[50:49] yesterday today and forever and he never
[50:52] changes so God deals with the individual
[50:55] we've been talking about about that as
[50:57] he has dealt with the church in three
[51:00] stages he deals with individual in
[51:03] justification uh sanctification and the
[51:05] baptism of the Holy Ghost and then the
[51:07] fourth stage if we could say it that way
[51:09] is the Holy Ghost itself coming and and
[51:12] having the preeminence in our lives and
[51:15] that is our adoption the message of the
[51:17] hour as we look forward to our full
[51:19] adoption which is the change of our
[51:21] bodies now brother brandom talks about
[51:23] how that the life come through the plant
[51:25] Jesus told us that except a corn of
[51:28] wheat go into the ground and die it
[51:31] abides alone but if it dies it brings
[51:33] forth much fruit and and so the church
[51:36] he said had to go into the ground and
[51:38] die in order to come through the stages
[51:41] of justification sanctification and the
[51:44] baptism of the Holy Ghost and then the
[51:45] Holy Ghost itself now now brother brand
[51:48] said the life that was in the in the
[51:49] stalk and in the tossle and in the husk
[51:52] all gathers in the seed yeah so all all
[51:56] the life that was in
[51:59] justification all the life that was in
[52:01] sanctification all the life that was in
[52:04] you have to help me this morning I
[52:05] having trouble with my voice and but all
[52:07] the life that was in those things uh
[52:09] gathered into the seed and I believe
[52:11] we're living in seed time how many
[52:14] believe that this morning we're living
[52:16] in the seed time so the life that was in
[52:18] one BR said the life that was in the
[52:20] stalk one went to make the other
[52:22] justification made a way for
[52:24] sanctification sanctification made made
[52:26] a way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[52:28] the baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way
[52:30] for the Holy Ghost itself to come right
[52:32] down in Perfection back to the word
[52:35] again to manifest itself so we know that
[52:38] it was the Holy Ghost in all three
[52:40] stages it was it's the holy ghost that
[52:42] justifies it's the holy ghost that
[52:44] sanctifies and it's the holy ghost that
[52:46] fills right and it's the holy ghost that
[52:48] is the word it it's all him and I'm so
[52:52] grateful for that today now but it it is
[52:54] a work of the Holy Ghost brother B said
[52:56] that this
[52:57] justification served its time he said in
[52:59] justification under Luther it had to
[53:01] become sanctification through Wesley
[53:04] sanctification served its time till it
[53:06] become the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[53:08] the baptism of the Holy Ghost served its
[53:10] time until the Holy Spirit which there's
[53:12] only one God he said Blends into the
[53:14] church and the church into Christ and it
[53:18] makes Jesus Christ reflected on the
[53:21] earth what he promised here in the Bible
[53:24] it makes Jesus reflected on the Earth
[53:27] what he promised in the Bible now we
[53:29] know that and I'm kind of hurrying to
[53:31] lay a background here so we can get to
[53:32] what we want to preach on this morning
[53:34] but it is possible to be
[53:36] justified and even Sanctified without
[53:39] having the baptism of the Holy Ghost but
[53:42] I'll say this if you're a seed of God
[53:44] you will become the grain yeah does that
[53:47] make sense your life as it goes through
[53:49] those stages it will not remain in
[53:51] justification it will not remain in
[53:53] sanctification it will end up at the
[53:55] baptism of the Holy H ghost and even the
[53:57] seed itself it does become that now why
[54:00] does it become that because of the type
[54:02] of seed that it is so you will become
[54:05] that so we don't need to spend all of
[54:06] our our life worrying well maybe I'll
[54:08] get stuck on justification maybe I'll
[54:10] get stuck on sanctification and be lost
[54:12] no it it was possible for people to do
[54:15] that but if you're a seen of God you'll
[54:17] go on into the fullness of the
[54:19] world Judas did not go on in oh he was
[54:23] justified and Sanctified yes but and we
[54:27] know that because because Jesus
[54:29] Sanctified his disciples he was
[54:31] justified and Sanctified but he did not
[54:33] go into the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[54:35] because he was the son of predition yes
[54:37] and so in first John 5:7 uh John deals
[54:40] with this and and brother brandom
[54:42] teaches about this but John deals with
[54:44] it like this there are three that bear
[54:45] record in heaven the Father the word and
[54:48] the Holy Ghost that's the Father the Son
[54:49] and the Holy Ghost these three are one
[54:53] someone say they are
[54:54] one they are one there there's only one
[54:57] God 1 John 5'8 and there are three that
[55:00] bear witness in in Earth the spirit the
[55:02] water and the blood and these three
[55:07] agree in one they're not one but they
[55:10] agree in one so it's possible uh to go
[55:12] to have one without the other and so
[55:15] brother B said notice the first three
[55:16] are one the second three are Earthly
[55:18] which agree in one you cannot have the
[55:20] father without the son you cannot have
[55:22] the son without having the Holy Ghost
[55:24] but you can have the water without the
[55:25] blood and the blood without the spirit
[55:27] yes so natural birth is the type so
[55:31] brother brand said it is so it is in the
[55:33] spiritual realm as it is in natural he
[55:35] said it's water justification by faith
[55:37] believing on God receiving him as your
[55:40] personal Savior and being baptized you
[55:42] got to go through that stage right if
[55:45] you haven't this morning you got to go
[55:46] through that stage you're never going to
[55:48] get started unless you go through the
[55:50] stage and do what God Said and repent
[55:53] and be baptized yeah right just hearing
[55:55] the word is not going to be enough
[55:56] you've got to do what God says so you've
[56:00] got to go through that now as you go
[56:02] through that he said second is
[56:04] sanctification of the spirit I want you
[56:07] to watch that this morning not
[56:08] sanctification of the flesh because the
[56:11] flesh is not
[56:12] Sanctified every flesh is just as rotten
[56:15] as every other
[56:16] flesh right but in sanctification of the
[56:19] spirit sanctification of the spirit that
[56:21] God cleanses the spirit from all
[56:25] elements of the world world and the
[56:27] desire of the world and then the Holy
[56:29] Spirit comes in I love that the Holy
[56:32] Spirit comes in and gives New Birth and
[56:35] fills up that Sanctified vessel and he
[56:39] explains it in a very uh way that we I
[56:41] think we can all get it this morning he
[56:43] said a glass is laying out in the
[56:45] chicken yard now that's a dirty
[56:49] glass if you've ever seen a glass laying
[56:51] in a chicken yard that is a dirty glass
[56:55] because there's nothing filled healthier
[56:56] than a chicken that's right and I I say
[57:00] that with passion because one of my jobs
[57:02] as a youth as a young person what when I
[57:05] was these kids' age was to clean out the
[57:07] chicken house whenever Dad decided he
[57:09] particularly didn't like me that day
[57:12] he'd sent me out to the chicken house
[57:13] and I got to clean it out and it didn't
[57:15] get cleaned regularly we we had a farm
[57:18] but it wasn't one of these these Farms
[57:20] where everything's painted and
[57:21] everything's nice and like that we had a
[57:23] real farm and so things were messy
[57:26] sometimes brother the Caleb and and so
[57:28] uh cleaning out the chicken house was a
[57:30] big deal so what we did uh what I
[57:33] learned to hate that because because it
[57:35] caused such filth and if there was ever
[57:37] a glass got put out there and I've
[57:39] actually seen it if there was ever a
[57:41] glass in the chicken yard you don't just
[57:43] pick that up and put it on your table
[57:46] and fill it with something to
[57:49] drink right you don't pick it up and put
[57:53] it on your table and fill it up with
[57:55] water or milk
[57:56] no he said by picking it up is
[58:00] justification you picked it up you've
[58:02] been picked up oh my and that's a
[58:04] wonderful thing you've been picked up
[58:07] but cleansing it is sanctification
[58:10] because the Greek word sanctify is a
[58:12] compound word which means cleansed and
[58:15] set aside for service so the idea is you
[58:18] take the glass and you wash it you put
[58:20] soap on it you you you you cleanse it
[58:23] with hot hot water as hot as you can
[58:25] find and you cleanse the impurities from
[58:27] it and you get it sparkling clean and
[58:30] then you set it up in the in the cabinet
[58:32] because one day you're going to fill it
[58:34] and use it amen so now you feel it he
[58:37] said he said it's not in service he said
[58:40] sanctification is a compound word which
[58:41] means cleansed and set aside for service
[58:43] not not in service for service then when
[58:46] you fill it it's put in service so
[58:49] everybody understand that now so
[58:52] sanctification uh in the Bible uh you
[58:55] know you say what why sanctification why
[58:57] why does god require Holiness Holiness
[59:01] in whenever you see the word Holiness
[59:03] especially in the New Testament in the
[59:04] Greek it's the same as the word
[59:06] sanctification Holiness why does god
[59:09] require Holiness Genesis 2:3 and I want
[59:14] us to think Beyond this morning I want
[59:16] us to think Beyond uh just dress when we
[59:20] talk about Holiness that is part of it
[59:23] but I want us I want us to think beyond
[59:25] that because sanctification is
[59:27] sanctification of the spirit amen and
[59:30] you could be you could dress everything
[59:32] right and do everything right and never
[59:35] never did anything wrong and always wee
[59:37] long dresses and long sleeves and and
[59:39] have a long face to go with it or
[59:41] whatever you want to to do you could
[59:42] have done everything right and not have
[59:45] a Sanctified
[59:47] Spirit how will you know if oh I'm
[59:49] getting head of myself here how do you
[59:50] know if you have a Sanctified Spirit if
[59:52] the word can come to you and it and you
[59:55] don't re re against it you've been
[59:58] cleansed from that you might have used
[59:59] to have been that but it don't bother
[1:00:01] you no more because you've been cleaned
[1:00:02] of that but when the word comes forth
[1:00:05] and and and and you get angry at it why
[1:00:08] because you're not Sanctified yet
[1:00:11] right that's
[1:00:13] true now look not in service for service
[1:00:17] now sanctification in Genesis 2:3 God
[1:00:20] introduces the idea of sanctification he
[1:00:23] said God bless the seventh day and San
[1:00:26] Sanctified it Sanctified it because that
[1:00:29] in it he had rested from all his work
[1:00:31] which God created and made now he didn't
[1:00:34] have to cleanse the second day but
[1:00:35] Sanctified in the in the Hebrew is
[1:00:37] apartness
[1:00:39] apartness sacredness
[1:00:42] Holiness he set it aside for himself the
[1:00:45] seventh day was his that's why he
[1:00:48] wouldn't allow them in the Old Testament
[1:00:50] it wouldn't allow them to work on the
[1:00:51] seventh day wouldn't allow them to
[1:00:53] travel only so far on the seventh day
[1:00:54] which was Saturday
[1:00:56] but now we've entered into rest as God
[1:00:59] entered into his rest Paul teaches us
[1:01:01] we've entered into rest our Sabbath is
[1:01:03] the Holy Ghost it's not Sunday we work
[1:01:06] on Sundays many of us do getting to
[1:01:08] church getting our kids up and getting
[1:01:09] ready Sunday can be a hard difficult day
[1:01:12] but that's not our rest our rest is the
[1:01:14] Holy Ghost whether we're working whether
[1:01:16] we're whether we're going to church
[1:01:17] whatever it is that we're doing our rest
[1:01:19] is the Holy Ghost so but on the seventh
[1:01:22] day God rested from all his all his work
[1:01:25] which he had created and made and he
[1:01:27] Sanctified or set apart the seventh day
[1:01:30] and and being a holy God he required
[1:01:34] Holiness in worship to him and so there
[1:01:38] were many ceremonial things which were
[1:01:40] types of things that we believe now
[1:01:42] today types of things that Christ did on
[1:01:44] the cross types of the blood many types
[1:01:47] that were that were made in the Old
[1:01:49] Testament but they were and they were
[1:01:50] ceremonial but it was because God was
[1:01:52] holy not just any you couldn't just come
[1:01:54] to God any old way way you couldn't come
[1:01:57] to God with any old fire it had to be a
[1:01:58] certain fire you couldn't come to God
[1:02:00] with any old offering it had to be a
[1:02:02] certain offering you couldn't come to
[1:02:04] God within your attitude it had to be a
[1:02:06] certain
[1:02:08] attitude right so you had to come to God
[1:02:10] a certain way you had to be set apart
[1:02:12] yeah and even the average person in that
[1:02:14] day couldn't even come to God directly
[1:02:16] they come through the priest who was set
[1:02:17] apart or Sanctified for the work of God
[1:02:19] and that's why today Peter tells us
[1:02:21] we're all Kings and Priests right we've
[1:02:24] been set apart for the work of I'm so
[1:02:26] glad you've been set apart today yeah so
[1:02:29] now
[1:02:31] watch now Exodus 29:37 tells us about it
[1:02:34] seven days Thou shalt make an atonement
[1:02:37] for the altar yeah for the altar it oh
[1:02:41] my if worship was going to be on it then
[1:02:44] it had to be Sanctified
[1:02:46] first if God was going to accept worship
[1:02:50] from the altar if he was going to accept
[1:02:51] a sacrifice from the altar it had to be
[1:02:55] sanctified before he would accept it do
[1:02:58] you see how important it is this morning
[1:03:01] so he said seven days thou shall make an
[1:03:03] atonement for the Altar and sanctify it
[1:03:05] and it shall be an altar Most Holy
[1:03:08] whatsoever toucheth the altar shall be
[1:03:11] holy whatever toucheth the altar shall
[1:03:14] be holy God is Holy he is set apart so
[1:03:18] anything DED dedicated him must be
[1:03:20] cleansed and set apart the word is used
[1:03:23] in the Old Testament of people and
[1:03:24] things Exodus 29:44 said I will sanctify
[1:03:28] the Tabernacle of the congregation and
[1:03:30] the altar I will sanctify also both
[1:03:32] Aaron and his sons to minister to me in
[1:03:34] the priest's office so it tells us that
[1:03:37] they had to be dressed in a certain way
[1:03:39] where the ROM talks about it they would
[1:03:40] put actually on their outer robe they
[1:03:42] would put on the bottom they put a
[1:03:44] pomegranate and a bell a pomegranate and
[1:03:46] a bell and when the man walked when the
[1:03:49] priest high priest walked in the holy of
[1:03:51] holies it would ring out but it didn't
[1:03:53] just make
[1:03:54] noise but it rang Holiness unto the Lord
[1:03:57] yeah that's what it was crying Holiness
[1:04:00] unto the Lord right because they had
[1:04:01] followed the instructions of God so
[1:04:03] every time the the bells would ring it
[1:04:05] would ring in a certain way and you knew
[1:04:07] that when you heard that noise you knew
[1:04:09] there was life yes oh God it's not just
[1:04:13] any noise but life that comes from a
[1:04:15] noise that comes from a life of
[1:04:17] Holiness is the noise that God
[1:04:21] accepts right so now now they had to be
[1:04:24] dressed a certain way and come in his
[1:04:27] presence a certain way Leviticus 8:6
[1:04:30] tells us that Moses brought Aaron and
[1:04:31] his sons washed him with water verse 10
[1:04:34] Moses took anointing wall and Anointed
[1:04:36] The Tabernacle all that was therein and
[1:04:39] Sanctified them verse 11 he sprinkled
[1:04:42] thereof upon the altar seven times and
[1:04:44] Anointed The Altar and all his vessels
[1:04:46] both the labor and his foot to sanctify
[1:04:48] them verse 12 he poured out the
[1:04:50] anointing wall upon Aaron's head and
[1:04:52] anointed him to sanctify him and he
[1:04:55] brought the bull of verse 14 for the sin
[1:04:57] offering and Aaron and his sons laid
[1:04:59] their hands on the head of the bullet
[1:05:01] for the sin offering why they had to be
[1:05:03] identified with their sacrifice brother
[1:05:05] Bram taught us we have to be identified
[1:05:07] with our sacrifice you've got to feel
[1:05:09] the death of your
[1:05:11] sacrifice you got to be identified with
[1:05:14] what he did for you there on Calvary I
[1:05:16] said we ought to be identified today
[1:05:17] with that it ought to do something for
[1:05:19] us right they had let the blood run all
[1:05:23] over them so they were identif ified by
[1:05:27] with their sacrifice and then but all of
[1:05:30] that alone the washing of the
[1:05:32] water all of the anointing oil they had
[1:05:35] to finish with something else now if you
[1:05:40] if you cut your hand got a little blood
[1:05:41] on
[1:05:42] your on your shirt collar say and or
[1:05:46] your cuff you know what you would do you
[1:05:49] you'd sanctify it you clean the blood
[1:05:52] off right you clean it off but that's
[1:05:55] that's not what God required in the Old
[1:05:57] Testament you didn't take the blood and
[1:05:59] clean it off but when you got done
[1:06:00] washing it anointing it cleaning it up
[1:06:04] you pour blood on it you sprinkle blood
[1:06:07] on
[1:06:08] it right because only the blood could
[1:06:12] sanctify oh god oh hope we recognize
[1:06:15] what go what he did for us today only
[1:06:18] the blood could really sanctify because
[1:06:20] the blood showed that it something had
[1:06:23] died because no matter how how much you
[1:06:26] sanctify that altar with anointing oil
[1:06:28] how much you sanctify that altar with
[1:06:31] with water there had to be Blood on the
[1:06:33] altar because when the blood came on the
[1:06:34] altar then there was known and it spoke
[1:06:37] back to God a life had been given oh I'm
[1:06:39] here to tell you today you can't be
[1:06:41] Sanctified by by just coming to church
[1:06:43] you can't be Sanctified by just saying I
[1:06:45] believe the message you can't be
[1:06:47] Sanctified by just saying well I'm just
[1:06:49] going to be a good person but you're
[1:06:50] Sanctified by the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:06:53] which was shed for you and when the
[1:06:55] blood is
[1:06:56] applied then sanctification is
[1:07:00] there now watch no amount of scrubbing
[1:07:03] can make something clean enough to serve
[1:07:05] God's purpose it takes the blood
[1:07:08] Leviticus
[1:07:09] 8:15 he slew it Moses took the blood put
[1:07:12] it on the horns of the altar round about
[1:07:13] with his finger and purified The Altar
[1:07:16] and poured the blood at the bottom of
[1:07:18] the Altar and Sanctified it to make
[1:07:21] reconciliation upon
[1:07:23] it Solomon's Temple
[1:07:26] was Sanctified by
[1:07:27] Jehovah in 2 Chronicles
[1:07:30] 7:14 it's a famous scripture he said If
[1:07:33] my people which are called by my name
[1:07:35] shall humble themselves and pray seek my
[1:07:38] face and turn from their Wicked Ways
[1:07:40] then will I hear from heaven will
[1:07:42] forgive their sin and will heal their
[1:07:44] land he said now mine eyes shall be open
[1:07:47] mine ears attent unto the prayer that is
[1:07:49] made in this place you want his eyes to
[1:07:51] be open I believe his eyes are open
[1:07:53] today why because you've been washed by
[1:07:55] the blood his eyes are open his his ears
[1:07:58] are attentive to your prayer yeah he
[1:08:01] said and he said for now I have chosen
[1:08:04] and Sanctified this
[1:08:06] house see that was the temple of God it
[1:08:10] had to be Sanctified I have chosen and
[1:08:12] Sanctified this house that my name may
[1:08:15] be there forever and my eyes and my
[1:08:17] heart shall be there
[1:08:19] perpetually oh God don't you realize
[1:08:21] that if you receive the baptism of the
[1:08:23] the Seal of the Holy Ghost the true
[1:08:24] baptism of the Holy Ghost that you
[1:08:26] cannot be lost that you don't go in and
[1:08:28] out anymore but you're sealed on the
[1:08:30] inside oh my to to your destination he
[1:08:33] said grieve not the Holy Spirit by which
[1:08:35] you're sealed till the day of your
[1:08:36] Redemption yeah right so you you can't
[1:08:39] be un you can't be sealed and then
[1:08:41] unsealed why because he Sanctified you
[1:08:43] and then he come down to live in you and
[1:08:45] he said you'll be my people forever yes
[1:08:47] sir right that's
[1:08:50] good Paul does the same thing for the
[1:08:52] spiritual Temple if you go and there's a
[1:08:54] whole teaching on this I time this
[1:08:55] morning to go into it but 1 Corinthians
[1:08:57] 6:19 he said what know you not it's your
[1:09:05] body now you think about this for a
[1:09:08] minute your
[1:09:10] body is the
[1:09:12] temple there's things we don't allow
[1:09:14] here in the church you come in with
[1:09:18] popcorn we don't allow you to eat it in
[1:09:20] the
[1:09:21] church you can sit up there in your car
[1:09:23] and eat it you can't come in the church
[1:09:24] with it
[1:09:26] why you know in the modern church today
[1:09:28] you just come in and and they got a
[1:09:29] coffee bar and you go out and sit out
[1:09:31] there for a while and I went to a gospel
[1:09:33] music concert at a church and I won't
[1:09:35] call the name of the church it a great
[1:09:36] big church and I went there and I
[1:09:38] thought well this pretty nice during the
[1:09:39] service you got TV screens it was like a
[1:09:42] a sports bar you know you had all the TV
[1:09:44] screens up here and you could sit there
[1:09:45] at the coffee shop drink your coffee and
[1:09:47] watch the preacher for a while and they
[1:09:49] had the kitty Zone and all the all the
[1:09:51] play things and all things like that I
[1:09:53] thought my goodness what a you know love
[1:09:55] to have areas like wonderful areas like
[1:09:57] that but see we don't allow those things
[1:09:59] in the church why don't we allow them
[1:10:01] here in the sanctuary where the
[1:10:02] preaching
[1:10:03] happens right we don't someone walks in
[1:10:07] with their hat on they take it
[1:10:09] off out of respect even myself when I'm
[1:10:11] here by
[1:10:13] myself I I I usually wear a hat because
[1:10:15] I'm losing my hair so I wear a hat
[1:10:17] because I found it's necessary not
[1:10:20] because I like to but just NE because
[1:10:21] it's hard to find a hat that fits his
[1:10:23] head but I've it's it's necessary some
[1:10:26] of y'all bald people can say Amen to
[1:10:28] that this morning so I Sanctified I put
[1:10:31] a hat on it you know and and I but when
[1:10:33] I come in here I take it off why that
[1:10:36] seems like why would you do that because
[1:10:38] we this is a sanctuary but this isn't
[1:10:41] the true
[1:10:42] Sanctuary you understand this isn't the
[1:10:44] real Sanctuary the real Sanctuary is in
[1:10:47] here the real Sanctuary is in your heart
[1:10:50] the reason you come to this Sanctuary
[1:10:52] the reason you're faithful to the house
[1:10:53] of God is because he dwell in Your Heart
[1:10:56] Right he said no you not your body is
[1:10:59] the Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in
[1:11:01] you which you have of God you are not
[1:11:04] your
[1:11:05] own you don't get to just make when
[1:11:07] you're Sanctified by the Holy Ghost and
[1:11:08] filled with his power you don't get to
[1:11:10] just make whatever decision you want to
[1:11:12] make you don't get to lead your life
[1:11:13] just whatever way you want to lead it
[1:11:15] you don't get to just go out and you say
[1:11:16] well I'll just go do this or I'll go do
[1:11:18] that no you you ask him you talk to him
[1:11:20] why you're the Temple of the Holy Ghost
[1:11:23] right and and the sons of God are moved
[1:11:26] by the spirit Spirit of
[1:11:29] God they're filled with the spirit of
[1:11:31] God and do what he says that's good walk
[1:11:33] by faith and not by sight not what I say
[1:11:36] what the spirit of God
[1:11:38] says right now
[1:11:40] look and and but the modern Church look
[1:11:44] they teach sanctification as
[1:11:47] optional right it's
[1:11:49] not it's not optional the Holy Ghost
[1:11:51] will not dwell in a dirty house right
[1:11:55] right and you are not born again until
[1:11:58] you've been filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:12:00] right right and so you can't he will not
[1:12:02] dwell in a dirty house but I'm so glad
[1:12:05] that he sanctifies Us by his blood yeah
[1:12:08] I'm glad he does that now to be
[1:12:09] justified and Sanctified is to be a
[1:12:12] partaker of heavenly things see it's not
[1:12:15] an optional thing Hebrews 12:14 follow
[1:12:18] peace with all men and Holiness that
[1:12:20] sanctification without which someone say
[1:12:22] no man no no man shall see the Lord
[1:12:26] right no no no human being is going to
[1:12:28] make it to heaven without being
[1:12:30] Sanctified and that's why I say it has
[1:12:32] to be a work of the Holy Spirit now look
[1:12:34] because we can't do that ourselves uh uh
[1:12:37] we we cannot sanctify ourselves we'll
[1:12:39] get to this in a moment we cannot
[1:12:40] sanctify ourselves until we have been
[1:12:42] Sanctified that makes sense we we we
[1:12:45] sanctify ourselves because we have been
[1:12:47] Sanctified and filled by the holy ghost
[1:12:49] look and I know and I want you to
[1:12:52] understand that you know sometimes
[1:12:53] people this this is to them because they
[1:12:55] say well you know I received the baptism
[1:12:57] of the Holy Ghost and and I never really
[1:13:00] my life was not cleaned up before but
[1:13:02] now I'm Different well he he justified
[1:13:04] you he Sanctified you he filled you with
[1:13:06] the Holy Ghost he can do that all at
[1:13:07] once he can do that over time but you
[1:13:11] know because there's been a change right
[1:13:14] right so don't let that get in your head
[1:13:15] because when I was a kid I thought I had
[1:13:16] to go to the altar three times I had to
[1:13:19] go for justification had to go for
[1:13:20] sanctification had to go for the baptism
[1:13:21] of the Holy Ghost because the wesling
[1:13:24] people had taught that sanctification
[1:13:26] was a second work of Grace which it is
[1:13:28] but it's just the second stage on the
[1:13:29] Journey of the new birth the new birth
[1:13:32] is it if you've got filled with the Holy
[1:13:33] Ghost and you had to have been
[1:13:34] Sanctified yeah does that make sense so
[1:13:37] and God can do that God can clean you up
[1:13:39] that's why it's a work of God not a work
[1:13:40] of your own right and yet yet sometimes
[1:13:43] it takes time it does take time because
[1:13:45] we have to die to ourselves in order to
[1:13:48] be born again but I'll say this whatever
[1:13:51] stage you've reached don't stop there
[1:13:53] keep pressing on say to those of you who
[1:13:55] have the baptism of the Holy Ghost now
[1:13:57] it's time for you to go to work that's
[1:14:00] right right because now is the time to
[1:14:02] sanctify yourselves now Hebrews 6:4 it
[1:14:04] is impossible for those who were once
[1:14:07] enlightened and have tasted of the
[1:14:08] Heavenly gift were made partakers of the
[1:14:10] Holy Ghost have tasted the good word of
[1:14:13] God and the powers of the world to come
[1:14:15] if they shall fall away to renew them
[1:14:17] again and repentance seeing They
[1:14:18] Crucified to themselves the Son of God
[1:14:20] aresh and put him to an open Shain now
[1:14:22] these are not those who have backs and
[1:14:24] come back back to church that's not what
[1:14:26] he's talking about he's talking about
[1:14:27] somebody who walked through
[1:14:28] justification and sanctification and
[1:14:30] looked at the Holy Ghost and mocked it
[1:14:32] and made fun of it and turned away from
[1:14:34] it and walked away and never had a
[1:14:36] desire in their heart again what was it
[1:14:38] what brother said if you have a desire
[1:14:39] in your heart you can be saved but but
[1:14:42] but they don't have no desire anymore
[1:14:44] why it's impossible for them to renew
[1:14:45] themselves because they walked up to the
[1:14:47] Holy Ghost and said I don't need it I
[1:14:48] don't want it it's not for me
[1:14:51] right right so we we need in our own
[1:14:54] selves we just make sure that you always
[1:14:56] want whatever God's got for you and
[1:14:58] he'll give it to you
[1:15:01] now he that despised Moses law Paul said
[1:15:04] died without Mercy under two or three
[1:15:06] Witnesses of how much sore punishment
[1:15:08] suppose you shall he be thought worthy
[1:15:10] who trotten under the foot the Son of
[1:15:12] God has counted the blood of the
[1:15:13] Covenant where with he was Sanctified an
[1:15:15] Unholy thing so he was Sanctified but he
[1:15:18] counted the blood of the Covenant as an
[1:15:20] Unholy thing at done despite to the
[1:15:21] spirit of Grace that's why
[1:15:22] sanctification is not enough you got to
[1:15:25] go on into the Holy
[1:15:27] Ghost taught us that the nazarin the
[1:15:29] pilgrim Holiness we were I was raised
[1:15:30] around those people and I know how holy
[1:15:33] their lives were many of them and how
[1:15:35] they lived they were Hypocrites there
[1:15:36] just like there are everywhere but there
[1:15:38] were some godly people there and they
[1:15:40] lived it they lived it but they they
[1:15:43] they turned down the Holy Ghost now
[1:15:45] their denomination their move has died
[1:15:47] yeah because they turn down the Holy
[1:15:49] Ghost yeah now
[1:15:52] sanctification as a part of the new
[1:15:54] birth
[1:15:56] is not a work of man but it's a work of
[1:15:59] Grace it's a work of the Holy
[1:16:01] Spirit now we are called we must receive
[1:16:05] the token that's what we must receive
[1:16:08] the Assurance all this well you say well
[1:16:10] I have to jump through all the Hoops now
[1:16:12] look at the ones who received the Holy
[1:16:13] Ghost when Peter preached in cornelius's
[1:16:16] house they hadn't been baptized yet they
[1:16:20] hadn't received but yet when the word
[1:16:21] was preached as the word was preached
[1:16:23] the Holy Ghost fell on the ENT entire
[1:16:25] congregation they received the Holy
[1:16:27] Ghost and then they went out spoke with
[1:16:28] tongues they went out and were
[1:16:30] baptized right so don't get in your mind
[1:16:32] well it has to happen this way it has to
[1:16:33] happen at this Camp it has to happen at
[1:16:35] this service it has to be in this kind
[1:16:36] of a no it can be whenever God wants it
[1:16:39] to be whenever he's calling you that's
[1:16:40] the moment to come when you hear him
[1:16:43] calling that's when to come you say
[1:16:44] brother Ben when should I go to an altar
[1:16:46] when should I seek the Lord you should
[1:16:48] seek the Lord when you feel a pull in
[1:16:49] your heart when there's something in you
[1:16:51] to go
[1:16:52] go whenever you feel that pull
[1:16:55] go because God can take it oh my who can
[1:16:58] take a clean thing an unclean thing make
[1:17:00] it clean God can he's the only one that
[1:17:03] can clean you up he's the only one that
[1:17:05] can when you feel that pole go you say
[1:17:07] well I'm not good enough go anyway he'll
[1:17:10] make you good enough that's his
[1:17:14] job we should Christians we should come
[1:17:18] to the altar when we when we feel his
[1:17:19] pres I'm not calling for an altar
[1:17:21] service every time we don't do that but
[1:17:22] just when you feel you have a need this
[1:17:25] a place to get it you can get it at home
[1:17:26] too you can get it in your closet but
[1:17:27] when you when when you feel that pull go
[1:17:30] to him yeah
[1:17:36] good I want us to be scared of asking
[1:17:39] for what we have need of he said you
[1:17:40] have not right CU you ask not right I
[1:17:44] want everything he's got for me I want
[1:17:46] to
[1:17:48] ask we're Sanctified what are we
[1:17:50] Sanctified by by the will of God yeah
[1:17:53] the Bible teaches that us that Hebrews
[1:17:54] 10:9 said then said he lo I come to do
[1:17:57] thy will oh God he taketh away the first
[1:17:59] that he may establish the second by the
[1:18:02] which will we are Sanctified through the
[1:18:06] offering of the body of Jesus Christ
[1:18:09] once for all right sir right so this is
[1:18:12] the work of sanctification as it relates
[1:18:14] to the New Birth he sanctifies You by
[1:18:15] his blood once for all yeah and every
[1:18:18] priest standeth daily ministering and
[1:18:20] offering often times the same sacrifices
[1:18:23] which can never take away sins
[1:18:25] but this man after you had offered one
[1:18:27] sacrifice for sins forever sat down on
[1:18:31] the right hand of God right from
[1:18:33] henceforth expecting amen till his
[1:18:35] enemies be made his foot stol oh if he's
[1:18:38] at the right hand of God do you realize
[1:18:39] he's also placed you at his right hand
[1:18:42] he's at the right hand of go my and he's
[1:18:45] placed you at his right hand that ought
[1:18:47] to mean that you ought to sit down
[1:18:48] expecting till God makes your enemies
[1:18:51] your foot stol expecting till cancer is
[1:18:53] under your feet expect till diabetes
[1:18:56] under your feet expecting till a new
[1:18:58] body is
[1:19:00] yours he sat down at God's right hand
[1:19:03] you sit down at his right hand in
[1:19:05] Heavenly places yes what the Bible
[1:19:08] teaches amen listen brother BR said when
[1:19:11] we were Sinners alienated without God in
[1:19:13] the world in that muck of mud he said
[1:19:16] God came to us God sought you you never
[1:19:18] sought God no man can come to me except
[1:19:20] the father draws him first and God came
[1:19:23] down in that muck what you were and

[1:20:28] yes
[1:20:30] amen
[1:20:32] hallelujah we got a sign somewhere I
[1:20:34] think we had it I don't know if we still
[1:20:35] have it on the wall but says all because
[1:20:37] two people loved one
[1:20:39] another and I would say when it comes to
[1:20:41] being a Christian it's not even about me
[1:20:44] loving him right but all that I have all
[1:20:46] of my life is because he loved
[1:20:50] me because he loved me my life you think
[1:20:53] about how different it is because you
[1:20:54] your wife met and and you love one
[1:20:56] another and and how different your life
[1:20:58] has become and how it's changed you as a
[1:20:59] human being because your your wife was
[1:21:01] just made for you she your counterpart
[1:21:03] and and you can look at one another and
[1:21:05] realize that's what God did in your life
[1:21:07] and just think how much more of a change
[1:21:09] it was when God come down in your life
[1:21:11] he loved you and you were unlovable and
[1:21:13] he changed you and made you into
[1:21:15] something new yes aren't you glad for
[1:21:18] that today that ought to make us worship
[1:21:20] we ought to be able to worship at that
[1:21:21] we shouldn't have to pump up worship we
[1:21:23] shouldn't have to have to just he said
[1:21:24] well if everything's not perfect I can't
[1:21:26] worship no no in the moments when
[1:21:28] everything is imperfect in the moments
[1:21:29] when everything's gone wrong in the
[1:21:31] that's when you lift your hands and you
[1:21:33] say Lord I love you I know what you did
[1:21:35] for me I know how different my life is
[1:21:37] than what it would have been if you had
[1:21:39] never touched it if you had never come
[1:21:41] down I realize how dirty and filthy I
[1:21:43] was and I know what you've done in my
[1:21:45] life right I know what you've done for
[1:21:48] me I'm not going to let anything talk me
[1:21:49] out of
[1:21:50] that Hallelujah somebody that loves you
[1:21:54] can't you have faith in what he's
[1:21:55] promised you then real genuine love will
[1:21:57] create a confidence in his word
[1:22:00] yes now
[1:22:02] sanctification is sanctification of the
[1:22:05] spirit of the spirit see God brother
[1:22:08] brand in in the 50s brother Harvey and I
[1:22:10] talked about this the other day he
[1:22:11] talked about he gave you a new spirit
[1:22:14] said because with the spirit that you
[1:22:15] got in you you couldn't get along with
[1:22:19] yourself said he gave you a new
[1:22:22] heart right a new heart Brother people
[1:22:24] mistake that for the Holy Ghost but it's
[1:22:25] not he gave you a heart or desire right
[1:22:27] to go along with the things of God yeah
[1:22:29] well that's justification and
[1:22:31] sanctification right but there's go but
[1:22:33] he said then I'll put my spirit in you
[1:22:35] yes and that's the baptism of the Holy
[1:22:37] Ghost now it's a cleansing of our spirit
[1:22:41] realm and of the mind it's not just say
[1:22:44] well I quit smoking I quit drinking
[1:22:46] that's part of it but it it's why
[1:22:49] because people by human effort can do
[1:22:50] some of those things but it's why it's a
[1:22:53] cleansing of the mind and the
[1:22:57] spirit I want us to think soberly about
[1:22:59] this today because I think all of us
[1:23:01] need
[1:23:02] this listen brother brand said secondly
[1:23:05] comes sanctification which sets our mind
[1:23:06] in order for Holiness to think
[1:23:10] right to think right we sanctify
[1:23:14] ourselves to the word until we can think
[1:23:17] right look he said then the next comes
[1:23:20] the baptism of the fire and holy ghost
[1:23:22] that God might dwell in US and the fire
[1:23:25] of God cleanses our hearts from sin puts
[1:23:27] the Holy Ghost Inside he said then we
[1:23:29] bring forth the same life that he did
[1:23:30] this did bring forth the same life that
[1:23:32] this did because that's in us see the
[1:23:36] word Christ comes into you the B said a
[1:23:39] man can repent of his sins and he's
[1:23:40] still thinking well maybe he's an
[1:23:42] immoral man every immoral looking woman
[1:23:43] he finds is still there now now what
[1:23:45] what does he do you know when when a man
[1:23:48] sees a woman that's immoral immorally
[1:23:50] dressed it's why we want we we ask our
[1:23:53] sisters to dress uh to dress according
[1:23:55] to the word not not according to some
[1:23:57] church theology or tradition but
[1:23:59] according to the word we ask that
[1:24:01] because when a man sees that and and
[1:24:04] even women have this to some extent but
[1:24:05] with men there's something about a man
[1:24:07] that when he sees that uh he it does
[1:24:10] something he he'll notice it now but
[1:24:13] noticing it that's temptation but it's
[1:24:16] dwelling on it that's
[1:24:19] sin right unless it's your wife
[1:24:22] obviously but dwelling on it is sin
[1:24:25] now look so he said well maybe he's an
[1:24:28] immoral man every immoral looking woman
[1:24:30] he finds is still there so in other
[1:24:31] words he wants to right he wants to he
[1:24:35] wants to sin he he wants to go out but
[1:24:38] see the the Sanctified man now how much
[1:24:41] more the baptism of the Holy Ghost fill
[1:24:43] in that Temple but even the Sanctified
[1:24:45] man watch he said when you get
[1:24:46] Sanctified cleanses that desire out of
[1:24:48] him takes the one of it away you can
[1:24:51] still be
[1:24:52] tempted huh
[1:24:55] temptation is not
[1:24:57] sin and we need to understand that our
[1:24:59] young people need to understand that he
[1:25:01] say well I'm always tempted by women
[1:25:02] well join the
[1:25:05] club boy that got quiet didn't it
[1:25:08] brother brother brandom held a put a
[1:25:10] cross in his car that's right that he
[1:25:12] looked at gave him something to look at
[1:25:15] so he could be reminded of the death of
[1:25:17] Christ that's why we have boundaries
[1:25:20] that's why we have wives and husbands
[1:25:21] and we set things up and have boundaries
[1:25:23] so we we put our young people it's not
[1:25:25] because we don't trust them we have
[1:25:27] boundaries and the way that they go
[1:25:28] together way they Court way they date
[1:25:30] things like that there's a reason for
[1:25:31] that because we realize people are
[1:25:34] human right but when but when you get
[1:25:36] Sanctified now now now watch there's
[1:25:39] something in you if you just constantly
[1:25:41] just lust after that and want to go
[1:25:43] after that it's because there's
[1:25:44] something wrong and there's something
[1:25:47] wrong and brother BR says it's a spirit
[1:25:49] it's a spirit that that needs to be
[1:25:51] cleansed out of you taken away from you
[1:25:54] look it he said he can still be tempted
[1:25:56] but he takes the want of it away still
[1:25:58] he's not right yet he said then he's
[1:26:00] baptized with the Holy Ghost in fire see
[1:26:01] God can make it where you where you
[1:26:03] never go do that again because you could
[1:26:06] be Sanctified Justified Sanctified and
[1:26:07] then still be pulled back out into that
[1:26:09] but God can so save a man until he won't
[1:26:12] want to ever do it again right the want
[1:26:15] to is just gone I say God take me there
[1:26:18] let let him take you there this morning
[1:26:20] until the want to is
[1:26:23] gone
[1:26:25] he's baptized with the Holy Ghost and
[1:26:26] Fire cleansed burned out cleaned up and
[1:26:28] put in the service of God he said
[1:26:30] sanctification only sets him aside for
[1:26:33] service brother brand talks about Mary
[1:26:35] Magdalene he said she didn't know she
[1:26:36] had Seven
[1:26:37] Devils she just thought she was
[1:26:40] pretty think about it for a minute she
[1:26:43] didn't realize she had Seven Devils on
[1:26:45] her making her do what she did she
[1:26:47] didn't realize it was just it was a
[1:26:48] spiritual realm in a spiritual realm
[1:26:50] there's a battle going on yeah and so
[1:26:52] she thought well she wore the dresses
[1:26:54] she did and the things she did she had
[1:26:55] Seven Devils but the one of them was
[1:26:57] Pride she didn't realize that it was a
[1:26:59] spiritual battle and and and again not
[1:27:02] because she was a bad person but it was
[1:27:03] spirits that gotten on her he said but
[1:27:05] now when you get that kind of spirit on
[1:27:08] you or men he said you get out here and
[1:27:09] start lusting for women he said you said
[1:27:11] well it's human nature not like that
[1:27:14] said see no it's a spirit the Bible said
[1:27:16] it was a spirit he say so the thing to
[1:27:19] do that's why we need a spiritual
[1:27:21] church right because there's a direct
[1:27:23] connection between being
[1:27:25] dead and sinning
[1:27:29] immorality come on church we need to be
[1:27:31] alive I don't say that means we're
[1:27:33] running the aisles and shouting all the
[1:27:34] time but we need to have something
[1:27:35] burning in our
[1:27:37] hearts because you get away from the
[1:27:39] fire of God this flesh is still
[1:27:41] flesh that's why we need to come to
[1:27:43] church on a regular basis come and and
[1:27:46] and and receive from God and be cleansed
[1:27:48] All Over Again by the washing of the
[1:27:49] water of the word we need that we need
[1:27:52] the presence of God we need power of God
[1:27:54] in our services come on because if not
[1:27:57] you you end up with immorality I've seen
[1:27:59] it hundreds of times yeah that that it
[1:28:01] just ends up in immorality and
[1:28:03] everything else we must have his
[1:28:05] presence as a minister his presence is
[1:28:08] not optional to me his anointing is not
[1:28:10] optional I must have it yes I must have
[1:28:13] it or I'll go out like everyone else
[1:28:15] does we must not grieve the Holy
[1:28:18] Spirit look it's a spirit the Bible said
[1:28:21] it was a spirit so the thing to do then
[1:28:22] he said the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:28:24] cleanses you from lust and passion
[1:28:26] called sanctification the word
[1:28:28] sanctification means to be cleaned and
[1:28:30] set aside for service he said no that
[1:28:32] lust Spirit leaves you under
[1:28:34] sanctification a little lady nice goes
[1:28:36] to church she sings in the choir but she
[1:28:38] has to mow her grass with a little pair
[1:28:39] of shorts on let her get Sanctified one
[1:28:42] time let her put on a pair see she won't
[1:28:44] do it she don't want to to let that man
[1:28:46] that'll almost have her wreck look at at
[1:28:47] that woman in the yard let him get
[1:28:50] Sanctified one time go down the street
[1:28:52] he'll keep his mind on what he's doing
[1:28:54] amen that's exactly right if he gazes
[1:28:55] sideways he'll turn his head this way
[1:28:57] the holy spirit says turn your head
[1:28:59] that's it see there you are he said
[1:29:00] that's
[1:29:01] sanctification now look you're
[1:29:03] Sanctified by the blood that's a work
[1:29:04] that God does in your life you can't do
[1:29:06] that for yourself but now look there is
[1:29:08] something we can
[1:29:09] do now you say what is that you say
[1:29:11] brother Ben I know I've been born again
[1:29:14] my sins are forgiven my life has changed
[1:29:17] how many can say Amen to that this
[1:29:18] morning I know God's done something in
[1:29:20] my life my life changed I know what I
[1:29:23] was I know what I am now I you know you
[1:29:27] couldn't I didn't want to go to church
[1:29:28] now I do I didn't want to serve God now
[1:29:30] I do I'm not perfect as John Newton said
[1:29:32] I'm not what I he said I'm not what I
[1:29:34] want to be he said but I'm not what I
[1:29:36] wish to be he said but I'm sure not what
[1:29:38] I
[1:29:40] was and so we could say that Amen to
[1:29:42] that today now we are we what happens is
[1:29:46] as after we've been
[1:29:47] changed there is an ongoing work of
[1:29:50] sanctification because I've told you
[1:29:51] before that that Spirit gets it's all
[1:29:54] clogged up that Spirit realm is not
[1:29:57] saved in other words what's sealed is
[1:29:59] the
[1:30:00] soul so the body and the spirit are not
[1:30:04] are not born again that's right right so
[1:30:08] if the body and spirit are not born
[1:30:10] again there has to be something
[1:30:11] continually right but the brand said the
[1:30:13] the blood Keeps Us saved
[1:30:15] yeah right and it's the blood the
[1:30:19] application of the blood in our lives
[1:30:21] and brother brand calls that applying
[1:30:23] the token
[1:30:24] right you take the token he said you
[1:30:25] take the blood it wasn't enough just to
[1:30:27] have it he said it must be applied it
[1:30:30] must be applied and he said you apply
[1:30:32] the token you kick all the trash out
[1:30:34] it's famous quote you apply that you do
[1:30:35] all of that why do you do that because
[1:30:37] you're applying the token you you're
[1:30:39] doing something about it right right so
[1:30:42] there's a there's a sanctification of
[1:30:44] the spirit realm that still takes place
[1:30:47] after you've been born again so you
[1:30:49] young people you come from camp and you
[1:30:51] realize you're just rejoicing and
[1:30:52] praising God and then you start F in
[1:30:54] battles just the devil tempting you
[1:30:56] devil trying you devil working on you
[1:30:58] old people the same way all of us fight
[1:31:00] battles theom taught us when we receive
[1:31:02] the baptism of the Holy Ghost the devil
[1:31:03] sets a Target on us yeah right and we
[1:31:06] start fighting battles yeah so you start
[1:31:08] fighting battles you say what am I going
[1:31:09] to do about my battle well you're going
[1:31:11] to you're just going to keep applying
[1:31:13] the blood applying the blood applying
[1:31:14] the
[1:31:15] blood right and that's
[1:31:17] sanctification now the Bible tells us
[1:31:21] that that there is an ongoing work the
[1:31:23] the Bible tells us we're Washed by the
[1:31:25] Water of the word right we're Washed by
[1:31:28] the Water of the word the Bible tells us
[1:31:30] we're continually Sanctified the Bible
[1:31:32] tells us that we we apply the token to
[1:31:35] our lives it tells us the bride makes
[1:31:36] herself
[1:31:38] ready right there's a constant cleansing
[1:31:40] because we get our Jesus taught Peter a
[1:31:43] great lesson he he he went to wash his
[1:31:45] feet and Peter says you won't wash my
[1:31:47] feet Jesus said if I don't wash your
[1:31:48] feet you're not part of me yeah right
[1:31:51] and so Peter's like he is you know
[1:31:54] before you got the Holy Ghost just this
[1:31:55] way and that way 100 degrees one way or
[1:31:57] the other and and and what he did he's
[1:32:00] like well uh he said then wash every
[1:32:02] part of me yeah Jesus said you don't
[1:32:04] need your whole body washed you're
[1:32:06] cleansed right but not all yeah right
[1:32:09] and he said you're cleansed but your
[1:32:10] feet get
[1:32:12] dirty right listen to me Church you're
[1:32:14] clean you've been clean by the baptism
[1:32:16] of the Holy Ghost you've been born again
[1:32:17] but you're your spirit gets dirty right
[1:32:20] you get you get little things on you
[1:32:22] little attitudes little things on you it
[1:32:24] shouldn't be there you begin to sit in
[1:32:25] church and and you can't sit in church
[1:32:27] without without something just consuming
[1:32:29] you because you think so this so and so
[1:32:31] wrong and so and so wrong you got this
[1:32:33] grudge against this one and that grudge
[1:32:34] against that one this one mistreated me
[1:32:36] that one Mist don't you realize what
[1:32:37] needs to happen come on you need to be
[1:32:40] Sanctified all right by the blood of
[1:32:42] Jesus Christ sanctify yourself yeah
[1:32:45] right can you do that Jesus
[1:32:49] did now
[1:32:51] watch this is not a work to be
[1:32:54] saved it works because we are saved
[1:32:59] yeah now Jesus was Sanctified by the
[1:33:01] Father John
[1:33:03] 10:36 he said say ye of him whom the
[1:33:06] father has Sanctified and sent into the
[1:33:08] world thou blasphemist because I said I
[1:33:10] the Son of God he said you called your
[1:33:12] prophets Gods he said but I've been
[1:33:14] Sanctified by the father other words he
[1:33:16] was already clean but he was set
[1:33:19] apart he was set apart to do the
[1:33:21] father's will to do only his will will
[1:33:24] he was Sanctified by the father yet in
[1:33:27] John
[1:33:28] 10:36 brother Brandon said it's the
[1:33:30] sweetest or John 1718 rather and 19 the
[1:33:34] B said is the sweetest scripture in the
[1:33:36] Bible he said and for the he said as
[1:33:39] thou has sent me into the world even so
[1:33:41] have I also sent them into the world and
[1:33:43] for their
[1:33:45] sakes now can you can you listen can can
[1:33:48] we just pull in for just about 10
[1:33:50] minutes now before we close just kind of
[1:33:52] stay with me for a minute
[1:33:54] he said for their
[1:33:56] sakes now now I want you to think about
[1:33:58] the their that God has given
[1:34:01] you God has given you a their their
[1:34:05] sakes a them a
[1:34:08] people your neighbor your friend your
[1:34:12] church your family your husband your
[1:34:15] wife right he's given you a them a their
[1:34:19] their sakes he's given you somebody yes
[1:34:23] and what does he say for their
[1:34:26] sakes I'd like to do this but for their
[1:34:31] sakes I'd like to live my own life and
[1:34:33] do my own thing but for their sakes what
[1:34:35] about your children
[1:34:38] today there's things I'd like to do
[1:34:40] there there's Liberties I'd like to take
[1:34:42] but for their
[1:34:44] sakes brother Rand talked about a man a
[1:34:47] preacher Don rle who was a man who
[1:34:49] pastored a church that was ultr legalist
[1:34:52] and brother B talks to him I don't
[1:34:53] remember what it was about I think it
[1:34:55] was short sleeves maybe that they they
[1:34:57] wouldn't wear short sleeves they'd only
[1:34:58] wear sleeves down to their elbows talked
[1:35:00] to me and said you don't believe that he
[1:35:02] said no he said but but they do he said
[1:35:04] so I I do it for their sakes brother B
[1:35:06] said I wanted to grab his neck and hug
[1:35:09] him because sometimes and that's what
[1:35:12] brother Brand's talking about when he
[1:35:13] said if Pastor sometimes Strays with the
[1:35:14] sheep in order to bring them back it's
[1:35:17] not that the pastor goes out and sin
[1:35:18] with them sometimes the pastor will will
[1:35:21] put up with maybe a wrong idea or
[1:35:23] something that somebody has because they
[1:35:24] want to save the person they want to
[1:35:26] help the
[1:35:27] person so he Sanctified himself he
[1:35:31] Sanctified himself listen Jesus
[1:35:33] Sanctified himself after he was
[1:35:36] Sanctified by the father you said well
[1:35:37] I've been cleansed by the blood I have
[1:35:39] the Holy Ghost that's enough but if you
[1:35:40] have the Holy Ghost you have the Life of
[1:35:42] Christ Living in you and what did Jesus
[1:35:45] do he Sanctified himself he set himself
[1:35:49] apart he lived apart from the world oh
[1:35:52] Church what will we do if he was
[1:35:55] Sanctified himself if he Sanctified
[1:35:57] himself after he was Sanctified by the
[1:35:59] father what will we do if his Spirit
[1:36:01] dwells in
[1:36:02] us hallelujah you find that in 1
[1:36:04] Corinthians 9:27 where Paul says I bring
[1:36:07] under my body I keep under my body and

[1:36:11] preached to others I myself would be a
[1:36:13] cast away I sanctify myself I know this

[1:36:27] lives every one of us need to do that no

[1:36:51] Sanctified he said sanctify them Father

[1:40:14] fo like I do he had a right to have
[1:40:16] things
[1:40:18] sir oh God but he turned it down right
[1:40:22] sir for your sake that's right for my
[1:40:25] sake he could have done it a man that
[1:40:27] could turn water into wine that could
[1:40:29] know where a coin was in a fish's mouth
[1:40:30] you know how rich I would be if I knew
[1:40:32] which fish had swallowed
[1:40:36] coins think about it for a minute be
[1:40:39] fishing all the time brother Allen
[1:40:41] forget banking we just go
[1:40:43] fishing if you knew which ones had coins
[1:40:45] in their mouth he
[1:40:49] did he can create
[1:40:52] money
[1:40:54] God he can still do that today by the
[1:40:56] way if you have a
[1:40:59] need he can create money but he didn't
[1:41:02] do it for your
[1:41:05] sake he knew where coin was he owned the
[1:41:07] heavens and earth yet he abstained from
[1:41:09] those things he abstained from those
[1:41:12] things he said the sweetest words in the
[1:41:14] Bible when he said father I sanctify
[1:41:16] myself that I might sanctify them what
[1:41:19] was he trying to do set an example he
[1:41:21] was sending 12 men out with a gospel
[1:41:23] that would conquer the world and he's
[1:41:24] depending on you and I to do it right he
[1:41:28] said if he could sanctify himself like
[1:41:29] that why ought we we to set aside every
[1:41:32] failure see you don't just sanctify
[1:41:34] yourself from sin but you sanctify
[1:41:36] yourself from sinful thoughts I'm not
[1:41:38] going to make it I'm not good enough I
[1:41:40] nobody likes me sanctify
[1:41:43] yourself for the sake of your
[1:41:47] children you hold that grudge against
[1:41:49] somebody I don't care who it is it'll
[1:41:51] kill your children that's right
[1:41:54] root of bitterness spring up in your
[1:41:56] life listen Church we've been through it
[1:41:59] but everybody goes through it
[1:42:01] yeah come on human human Humanity being
[1:42:04] a human is not
[1:42:10] easy I read about the Korean
[1:42:13] church that the Japanese when they went
[1:42:15] into Korea in World War to they found a
[1:42:18] church full of Believers worshiping like
[1:42:19] we are this morning and surrounded the
[1:42:21] church and burn it with fire
[1:42:24] Christians burn
[1:42:27] up and later on it become a hate in the
[1:42:31] in the eyes of the people for the
[1:42:32] Japanese because of what they did my
[1:42:34] grandpa fought the Japanese World War II
[1:42:36] and he hated the
[1:42:37] Japanese because of what they the way
[1:42:39] that they fought and things they just
[1:42:41] commit suicide and bomb and kamakazi and
[1:42:44] all those things and he just hated them
[1:42:46] wouldn't buy anything was Japanese and
[1:42:49] but yet these Koreans were real
[1:42:50] Christians and they they uh they went to
[1:42:54] they they they got burned up and their
[1:42:56] family members they watched them burning
[1:42:58] people that were on their way to church
[1:43:00] watched their family members and their
[1:43:01] the people they fellowship with burn
[1:43:04] up years
[1:43:06] later years later that church started up
[1:43:10] again and the pastor found it's like 50
[1:43:13] years later the pastor found that those
[1:43:15] people they couldn't get over it they
[1:43:16] just it just continued on for
[1:43:17] Generations he said we're going to break
[1:43:19] the cycle and they become missionaries
[1:43:21] to
[1:43:22] Japan
[1:43:24] that church sent out oh God missionaries
[1:43:26] to Japan to tell them about the good
[1:43:27] news of the Gospel why because oh God
[1:43:30] they what happened they got they
[1:43:32] Sanctified themselves against
[1:43:36] that that's good just because you're
[1:43:39] born again doesn't mean Satan won't get
[1:43:40] a hold of you and try to make you
[1:43:44] bitter sanctify
[1:43:46] yourself we have to set aside every
[1:43:49] failure every doubt and everything else
[1:43:52] yeah and say ify
[1:43:54] ourselves brother B said what was he
[1:43:56] doing he was training up 12 disciples
[1:43:58] that were going to preach the gospel in
[1:43:59] all the world he put an example he said
[1:44:01] Brethren as ministers I tell you there
[1:44:04] only I think two of us this morning
[1:44:06] brother Joel and I but it speaks to us
[1:44:07] and brother steuart not here this
[1:44:09] morning but he it speaks to him as well
[1:44:11] speaks to all the ministers that come
[1:44:12] and stand behind this Pulpit listen to
[1:44:14] me said you preachers I'm talking to he
[1:44:17] said you Brethren as ministers I tell
[1:44:18] you it pays us not to get too much of
[1:44:21] the world's goods and things hanging
[1:44:23] around us you preachers I'm talking to
[1:44:26] sanctify yourself for them that you're
[1:44:29] going to
[1:44:31] lead see that's what we need today is a
[1:44:33] complete consecrated Sanctified life of
[1:44:36] ministers amen that walk upright before
[1:44:39] God God help me today does not entangle
[1:44:42] with the things of the world keep away
[1:44:44] from it taking that as a personal
[1:44:46] challenge you failed with the B many
[1:44:48] times that's why I sanctify
[1:44:51] myself I I want the newest car I want I
[1:44:54] want the biggest boat I want to do that
[1:44:56] but we sanctify
[1:44:59] ourselves the thing is when you do get
[1:45:02] power and you do get money what do you
[1:45:03] do with
[1:45:06] it CU if you were the boss I think about
[1:45:09] it for just a moment you come to church
[1:45:10] and and maybe you struggle maybe your
[1:45:12] boss don't let you come on Sundays or
[1:45:14] something like I've got situations like
[1:45:15] that I just wrote a letter for one
[1:45:17] brother to their uh company trying to
[1:45:19] let them come to church on Sundays cuz
[1:45:21] people don't respect that much any
[1:45:23] more and and so you know we work
[1:45:26] sometimes people have to work and they
[1:45:28] have to be out of church but but the
[1:45:30] thing is are we are we Sanctified and
[1:45:32] I'll say this some of y'all if you if
[1:45:34] you become a preacher and you didn't
[1:45:36] have to work no no one was your boss in
[1:45:38] the sense that they didn't wake you up
[1:45:39] in the morning what would you do if you
[1:45:42] become
[1:45:43] self-employed that well if I was just
[1:45:45] self-employed everything I wouldn't have
[1:45:46] those hours anymore boy I'd be at church
[1:45:49] I've seen that people who were not
[1:45:50] Sanctified when they were worked for
[1:45:52] somebody were not Sanctified when they
[1:45:54] didn't work for somebody
[1:45:56] amen well the situation was just
[1:45:59] different most of the time it stays the
[1:46:01] same find somebody who serves God under
[1:46:05] hardship and then you'll have somebody
[1:46:06] who serves God when things get a little
[1:46:10] easier and I'll challenge you young
[1:46:12] people sanctify yourself you're a you're
[1:46:14] a generation we seen that we are the
[1:46:16] generation let's sanctify ourselves keep
[1:46:18] ourselves in the house of
[1:46:20] God all right
[1:46:24] wonder he said keep away from
[1:46:27] it listen Jesus was God's wrapped gift
[1:46:30] tell me believes that today he was God's
[1:46:33] gift to the Earth at Christmas time
[1:46:35] brother B talks about that when he
[1:46:37] preaches his Christmas sermon God's W
[1:46:38] gift he said oh gifts of God we're all
[1:46:41] gifts of God that's what he taught us
[1:46:43] that sermon were wrapped gifts to the
[1:46:44] world oh gifts of God you people who
[1:46:47] claim you've received his Spirit keep
[1:46:49] yourself Sanctified so not just
[1:46:51] preachers but all of us
[1:46:53] keep yourself Sanctified yes keep away
[1:46:56] from the things of the world be
[1:46:58] Sanctified the BR said Jesus was
[1:47:00] training 12 men that through those 12
[1:47:02] men he was to take the gospel to the
[1:47:03] world he said for their sake I sanctify
[1:47:05] myself he said make yourself for your
[1:47:07] neighbor's sake for somebody else's sake
[1:47:10] don't use your Liberty for a cloak said
[1:47:12] Paul but sanctify yourself behave
[1:47:15] yourself in the neighborhood like a real
[1:47:17] Christian ought to let your
[1:47:18] communication be if you meet your enemy
[1:47:22] yeah
[1:47:23] sanctify
[1:47:24] yourself for his sake all
[1:47:28] right not knowing what you might do
[1:47:32] yes but the brandham had to sanctify
[1:47:35] himself it didn't come easy because he
[1:47:38] was a prophet was that much harder
[1:47:42] yeah brother BR could have taken that
[1:47:44] gift and charged for
[1:47:48] it the gift would have still been
[1:47:50] there but he Sanctified him
[1:47:54] himself brother brand talks about how he
[1:47:56] got old getting older he couldn't preach
[1:47:58] like he used to he felt like couldn't go
[1:47:59] like he used to he turned down to some
[1:48:01] meetings because he just felt like he
[1:48:02] couldn't do it and then he felt
[1:48:05] bad and so he said after praying for
[1:48:08] three or four days he said I got in such
[1:48:10] a place going around thinking oh God
[1:48:12] said I got in such a place that I didn't
[1:48:13] know what to do said God we're at the
[1:48:15] end of the road and I realized I've
[1:48:16] neglected I've had calls to go on and be
[1:48:18] tired and wouldn't do it that's a that's
[1:48:20] an admission to make you realize pastor
[1:48:22] are human people are human and sometimes
[1:48:26] you don't feel like going to church and
[1:48:27] sometimes I don't
[1:48:29] either I didn't feel like preaching this
[1:48:32] morning and and and sometimes you just
[1:48:35] don't feel like preaching but you
[1:48:37] go if you're not going to do it how's
[1:48:39] everybody else going to do it so you
[1:48:41] sanctify yourself for their sake now
[1:48:42] look look and not to myself as an
[1:48:44] example because many times I fail but
[1:48:46] brother the BR said he
[1:48:47] failed he said I've had calls to go on
[1:48:49] and be tired and wouldn't do it I
[1:48:51] thought then I could see my Lord
[1:48:52] staggering through the dark when he was
[1:48:55] so tired he could hardly raise one foot
[1:48:57] after the other
[1:48:58] one Oh my he talked about how he went by
[1:49:02] the Widow of Na's son you remember him
[1:49:04] he went to that funeral brother said he
[1:49:06] was sitting on the side of the road with
[1:49:07] a
[1:49:08] headache and he went to the Widow of
[1:49:10] Na's funeral he was suffering in his own
[1:49:11] body but here come here come a funeral
[1:49:13] procession by and he walks up to the
[1:49:15] funeral and raises the dead Jesus never
[1:49:19] preached the funeral he raised the dead
[1:49:22] and he raised the dead and went back and
[1:49:23] sat back down with his
[1:49:27] headache he was tempted like we
[1:49:30] are but the brother said well how did I
[1:49:32] get tired he said after seeing what he
[1:49:34] did how he persevered so how did I get
[1:49:36] tired what's the matter with me Lord
[1:49:38] here I think well I'm getting old I
[1:49:39] can't do it he thought of Moses and
[1:49:41] Caleb some of you Elders you you think
[1:49:43] about this this morning Moses was 120
[1:49:45] and said his strength wasn't
[1:49:47] Abad Caleb was 80 years old and he said
[1:49:49] I'm as ready now as I ever was
[1:49:53] you said maybe that was something
[1:49:54] Supernatural something eight it could
[1:49:55] have been it could have been
[1:49:56] Supernatural strength but it might have
[1:49:58] just been perseverance Caleb was maybe
[1:50:00] he he didn't have the maybe he didn't
[1:50:01] have the physical strength he used to
[1:50:03] but he had some spiritual willpower he
[1:50:05] had some ability he knew he had been
[1:50:07] through some things and he said I'm not
[1:50:09] going to let this stop me I'm not going
[1:50:11] to let the weakness of my body stop me
[1:50:13] I'm going to church I'm going to serve
[1:50:14] for God serve
[1:50:17] God good we need you Elders we need you
[1:50:22] sister Fritz this morning sitting at
[1:50:23] home we need sister Fritz how me say
[1:50:25] Amen to that this morning we need women
[1:50:28] of God who serve God that woman's got a
[1:50:30] testimon she served God in spite of her
[1:50:32] husband kicking around I I don't mean to
[1:50:34] I don't mean to sister fris I know
[1:50:35] you're watching probably this one I
[1:50:37] don't want to make you feel bad but but
[1:50:38] her but her her husband because she
[1:50:40] believed the message of the hour said
[1:50:41] I'm not having none of that and so she
[1:50:43] lived Godly before the Lord all these
[1:50:45] years all of these years and and helped
[1:50:48] any way she couldn't and today she I
[1:50:50] know the devil gets after cuz she feels
[1:50:51] like she can't do enough but I'll say
[1:50:52] this God give me a hundred
[1:50:54] more give us a 100 more to serve God
[1:50:57] like that I don't care what your age is
[1:50:59] be like Caleb and stand up and say I'm
[1:51:01] as able now I may not have the physical
[1:51:04] strength but I've got the ability to
[1:51:06] pray and I couldn't we couldn't do what
[1:51:08] we've done you think this church would
[1:51:10] be what it is even today and and the
[1:51:12] things that we've seen without prayer
[1:51:14] warriors who get down on their knees at
[1:51:16] night and pray for me and pray for each
[1:51:18] one of you it's not just her all of you
[1:51:21] you Elders I know you've been through
[1:51:22] some things you take that and say I'm as
[1:51:24] able
[1:51:25] today as I ever was what would we be
[1:51:28] without a Danny Ward what would we be
[1:51:30] without some of you all many of you all
[1:51:32] start calling names I'll get myself in
[1:51:33] trouble where would we be without men
[1:51:35] who stood there with a sword all right
[1:51:38] stood for the word of God some of you
[1:51:41] some of you were born in this church
[1:51:42] went to this church gab was telling me
[1:51:43] he'd been in this church all his life
[1:51:46] why do this church stayed open because
[1:51:48] of men that stood there and said I'm not
[1:51:49] too old I'm not too tired I I I'm not
[1:51:54] going to go run after money I'm going to
[1:51:55] serve God here in Hardy

[2:00:11] anything they put a crown of thorns on
[2:00:13] his head and he was so weak that he fell
[2:00:16] on the way and Simon picked up his cross
