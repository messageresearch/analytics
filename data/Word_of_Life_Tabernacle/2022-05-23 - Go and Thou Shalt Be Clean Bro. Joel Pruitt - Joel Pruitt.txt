come expecting something from the lord i believe he's here to meet every need tonight that we would have need of and anything that would be in our hearts and if we could just go ahead and turn into our bibles to james chapter one we'll read just one verse there before moving on to second kings chapter five amen are you did you enjoy that sermon this morning amen that was good i believed i felt the spirit of the lord there come in at the end i've been in prayer lines where you just feel that anointing come on but i believe right there this morning those that came forward i believe there was an anointing there to take care of every issue that you came with if we just believe it that's where that's where the thing lies is where we can believe if we can ever come under that anointing there and then just believe that that what we had need of was already taking place it's already done it's a finished work if we can just go believing james chapter 1 verse 25 but whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty and continueth therein he being not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work this man shall be blessed in his deed and you may be seated and we'll turn over there to ii kings this is a little bit of a longer scripture reading so i was going to let you sit for this second kings chapter 5 and we'll read verses 1 through 14. this is talking about naaman and the prophet elisha here says now naaman captain of the host of the king of syria was a great man with his master and honorable because by him the lord had given deliverance unto syria he was also a mighty man in valor but he was a leper and the syrians had gone out by companies and had brought away captive out of the land of israel a little maid and she waited on naaman's wife and she said unto her mistress would god my lord were the were with the prophet that is in samaria for he would recover him of his leprosy and one went in and told his lord saying thus and thus said the maid that is of the land of israel and the king of syria said go to go and i will send a letter under the king of israel and he departed and took with him ten talents of silver six thousand pieces of gold and ten changes of ramen and he brought the letter of the king of israel saying now when this letter is coming to thee behold i have therewith sent name in my servant to thee that thou mayest recover him of his leprosy and it came to pass when the king of israel had read the letter that he rent his clothes and said am i am i god to kill and to make alive that this man does send unto me to recover a man of his leprosy wherefore consider i pray you and see how he seeketh the quarrel against me and it was so when elisha the man of god had heard that the king of israel had written his clothes that he sent to the king saying wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes let him now come to me and he shall know that there is a prophet in israel so naaman came with his horses and with his chariot and stood at the door of the house of elisha and elisha sent a messenger on him saying go and wash in the jordan seven times and thy flesh shall come again to thee and thou shalt be clean now there's the order from the prophet of god right there that is the word of the lord to be believed and then he had to do it but naaman was wroth and went away and said behold i thought he will surely come out to me and stand and call in the name of the lord as god and strike his hand over the place and recover the leper are not habana and far par rivers of damascus better than all the waters of israel may i not washing them and be clean see he wanted a different way a better way something that looked better felt better may i not wash them and be clean so he turned and went away in a rage and his servants came near and spake unto him and said my father if the prophet had bid thee to do some great thing would thou not have done it how much rather then when he saith to thee wash and be clean then he went down and dipped himself seven times in the jordan according to the saying of the man of god and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child and he was clean obeying god may seem foolish but it does bring results naaman here is given the prescription to be healed but it seems just a little bit far-fetched it seems like something it just doesn't hold with prestige the way he would want it to it's not something he wants to do because it doesn't feel good it's dirty water it's something but see there was a test that had to come to see if he was serious about getting healed if he was serious about wanting the word of god or if he just wanted he wanted the prophet to come and say hey you're healed you're good to go you don't have to come up here and stand at the altar you don't have to pray through the man of god doesn't have to lay hands on you none of these things have to happen just just go and just just have an intellectual talk and be well but he was able to hear the instruction but then there's something else to the instruction he had to actually go and obey what the prophet said brother brahm says this about name and he said now did you notice people they want to get this healed they want to get healed and they get and get the holy spirit the way they think they ought to have it he said now come on down brother if you'll bring me up and take me into a room where nobody will see me and you lay your hands upon me and bless me put the holy ghost in me i'll accept it he said oh no naaman wanted to accept his healing like that one time but elisha told him to get out there in the old muddy jordan and dip seven times he said i can just see him get off his chariot oh a great man hold his nose here he comes out in the water tiptoeing like a cat in molasses he said you know it's coming out like this he said you know getting out like that get down this water he said oh i hate to do this some people come to the altar like it was some sickening affair for them he said oh i don't want to do that he ducked down one time and then he still got leprosy why because he said seven times you've got to dip in the jordan still got leprosy the prophet said seven times right until he obeyed the word completely and until you obey it completely he still had the leprosy oh i would like to be i want to be saved i want to be filled with the holy ghost but there is a prescription you must follow to get that he had a good man standing on the bank said the prophet said seven times father see just keep on dipping that's it you don't get it the first night just dip until you get it just keep on till you get it and the water didn't have the healing but doing what the word said obedience to the word brought the results see it wasn't in the water if i go step in the water one time the baptism will never save you but the obedience to the word of god he said when you'll be baptized you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost now the holy ghost wasn't in the water but it is a gift that god gave you once you follow the word it doesn't matter how foolish this sounds doesn't matter how much of an inconvenience it would be to you well i don't want to get wet in my best clothes if god is tugging at your heart to get baptized go get baptized follow the word and a blessing will come he said if you love me keep my words the rich young ruler wanted to get the benefits of following jesus but when he had to give up something when he had to be maybe just a little bit more poor or had to give away something then he stopped that's the problem today we don't want to go into a way that would that would seem foolish to the world but god requires a separated people to come out of babylon to come out of the things of the world and be separate saith the lord so that we can go forward into our inheritance why is it because we we think we've got to be in the biggest church or have the best pastor and we have the best pastor by the way but if you think you've got to have the biggest church or you've got to have the the nicest building and drive the best cars you're looking at the wrong thing but he said come according to the word of god and when you come according to the word the blessing will come sanctification will come when you follow the word justification will come according to the word the holy ghost will come upon you when you follow the word of god brother branham said this he said there's one thing to teach something there's another thing for god to confirm it and say it's the truth there's one there's one thing to say something another thing to do something it's not hearers it's doers he said show me your faith without your works and i'll show you my faith said paul by my works if you believe it you'll act upon it that's it he said well why don't you come and join with me why don't you believe me well of course we have regulation and our regulation is a tradition of the elders which says if you don't belong to the sanhedrin or the denomination here at jerusalem why we'll all be excommunicated and therefore we can't accept it see it had to be a certain way and that's the way it was with jesus so many missed him because he didn't come in a pink decorated hospital room he come out there in a manger and people missed the messiah even though he come and did the works because he didn't come according to their mental ideas and conceptions but he come according to god's way and they missed it a virgin shall conceive but it didn't come according to the way they thought it should happen no man was willing to admit that no man could do the things that he did except god be with him why god is proving his gospel god always did it he said now my clergy brethren and sunday school teachers let us reason for a minute did you know religion is one thing salvation is another did you know it come from genesis realize that cain was a religious man just as religious as abel was he came before the lord he realized that he was immortal he had to die and he built an altar unto the lord and a church he brought it in made a sacrifice to the lord paid his tithes paid his offerings as it were to the lord and besides that he knelt down and worshiped the lord he did all the things that looked right and so if belonging to church and supporting the church and bringing in your tithes and offering and kneeling down and worshiping is all that god requires a man to do then he would be unjust to condemn cain because cain done every bit of it he said but the only way that abel was just it was a spiritual revelation it wasn't by the works it was by faith and if you believe by faith a true faith in the word of god then you'll act upon it the action don't come first the faith comes first and then you'll act upon the word of god you hear the word then you'll act upon the word not him that worketh but him that believeth not apples and peaches and pears are the fruits of the land he says that brought us out of the garden of eden but it was the blood and jesus vindicated the same thing when he said flesh and blood has not revealed this to you simon peter when he confessed him to be the lord he said you never learned this in a seminary you never learned this from some church but my father which is in heaven has revealed it to you and upon this rock i will build my church there is the prescription and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it spiritual revealed truth of the living god when god has revealed to you by the holy spirit not by a theology not by mental thinking but by the actual birth of the holy spirit don't we want to follow the word through the holy spirit see otherwise it's just a bunch of rules and regulations we think we've got to do this and i've got to do that but when god reveals that thing to do then you act on it that's when you do it it's no longer a rule it's no longer a regulation but that's by grace you have obeyed the word of god he said jesus christ raised from the dead you have eternal life that's the revelation wish we had time to bring it through the bible he said look at korra moab in the bible when israel come up there was moab come from the sons of lot which was by his daughter and they had a great place a great church when they come down to curse israel they built the same kind of altars pray to the same god made the same sacrifices bullocks they offered a sheep representing the coming of christ and fundamentally speaking everything that moses was offering down there balaam was offering up here so if god only requires fundamental teaching as intellectual god could not refuse balaam's offering but the reason why did he refuse balaam and except moses is because moses there was signs and wonders god was vindicating they had divine healing a brass serpent they had a smitten rock they had joy do we have joy today they had the leading spirit they had a pillar of fire they had everything among them signs and wonders god proving that he accepted them that's the way it is today it was when jesus and nicodemus stood together nicodemus in a fine church orthodox as it could be taught to the very last word and jesus was also but god was with jesus rabbi we know that thou art a teacher come from god for no man can do miracles you do except god be with him so they recognize here that jesus was actually come from god they recognized these these pharisees actually knew that this was a man sent from god but they couldn't obey the works they couldn't obey the words that jesus taught why because it sounded foolish to them and they had a preconceived idea and a mental idea of how things should happen they had a law over here but there was a revelation of blood that they completely missed he said now notice they could admit jesus was a man sent from god and so they go on down here they couldn't believe from the heart or they would follow see this is how it was he said he followed and did the words and he spoke and then that works would be followed them that believed so it wasn't just the works but you believe first you have to believe something before you can actually go do it if if brother ben told me to stand on my head if there was if i didn't believe that would do me any good i'm not going to do it if i could do it i wouldn't do it unless i really believed that it would be for a purpose of healing so to be dipped in the river of jordan seven times you think about it this way he had to believe that it was actually going to heal him or it wouldn't done him any good if you come up here and we lay our hands on you and you feel the anointing of the holy ghost upon you we can do we can we can pray and we can pray but if you don't believe it's not going to do you any good you have got to believe before the healing takes place brother branham in the prayer lines many times you'll hear him say this go believing and if you believe you'll get what you ask for but what was the prescription you have to believe we have a part to play in this thing we have to do something about it and it's not a work but we should want to do something when god's word said something that's grace that caused us to believe in the first place and when grace has taken hold of our hearts then we act upon the word of god we are a part of another he said don't you never let satan tell you anything else being a part of one another we are a part of him we are fellow citizens of the kingdom enjoying these blessings together of the resurrection the son is just now on you and now you're growing into a blossom life like he was to be resurrected completely in the last day your potentials you have now we just got to believe that your potentials what you will be after the body change is already in you now what you will be is here the theophany is here the word body is here but we have got to believe that it will happen we have got to believe that a resurrection is coming or else world worshiping in vain he said your body come in obedience to it didn't it in obedience to what a church know the word which is the life then you are now resurrected from the dead you are already already resurrected from the dead if you believe it he said the potentials they're already there think about that he said your body come into obedience to what the word now he said and the bible tells us in james 1 21 24 through 24 he said wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness and receive with meekness the engrafted word which is able to save your souls we have to believe that he said but be doers of the word and not hearers only deceiving your own selves think about it like that i can sit and i can hear the word and i can read this bible millions of people read this bible through on it maybe on a daily basis but it's not doing them any good if they're not taking the letters out of the book and putting it in the heart where they can take it and put it into action it doesn't do any good for god to call a man to preach if he never preaches it doesn't do any good for you to say well i believe in a prophet if you're not going to do what he says oh i believe in hearing the tapes they won't do you no good if you don't actually believe what's on the tapes i believe everything in this bible it don't do me no good if i completely go against it it does mean no good if i just believe from a head knowledge because i have not applied that to my heart i have not actually believed what i'm doing is i'm actually a make-believer and brother branham said out of the three kinds of believers the make-believer was the worst kind why because he says i know it's right to go to church i know it's right to pay my tithes i know it's right i know the word is right i know the message of the hour is right but when it comes down when the rubber hits the road they can't do it they can't do what he said he said and right here in james he said he said you're deceiving your own selves he said for if any be a hearer of the word and not a doer he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass for he beholdeth himself and go with his way and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was but whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty perfect law of liberty think about it it's not a law of bondage this is a perfect law of liberty by grace and continueth therein he being not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work this man shall be blessed in his deed do you want a blessing obey the word of god not through rules not not because i said to do it not because one of these other ministers said to do it because the word says to do it and when you fall in love with the word of god the word of god will come down into your heart and it's a love affair you actually feel bad when you don't do the word you say well i failed god i had this happen to me and it kept me out of church and this over here kept me out of my position here and i couldn't i couldn't show up on this service and and i couldn't do this and maybe maybe time or maybe there's an ox in the ditch or maybe this happened that's okay but but think about how that that hurts your heart because you're saying i can't do it because i really had a legitimate reason but there's still something in there that is wanting you to obey the word of god and that is the spirit of christ trying to bring your body under subjection do you want a revival in your life every one of us should want that then we have to come god's provided way we don't just make the revival but the revival is in us we are the revival but we don't just make it happen by just by just going about our business and never actually obeying the word of god reading the bible doesn't save me reading the bible doesn't cause revival in my life but acting upon the word sure can he said you want to be healed come into obedience to the word you want your family saved do you want to see all of your family saved apply the token according to the word and it will happen see we just have to believe that this word is able to do it we have to believe that when we come expecting that that's something we say all the time did you come expecting something good from the lord but that's a real thing there really is a something you can get from god if you come expecting something good from god but if you come and you think well i'm just going to hear another preacher i'm just going to have another sermon and i have checked a box and i've come and i've done what i've had to do then you really haven't met god yet you're just going through the motions and the rules but when you get down on the inside and something says you can't wait to be a church with the believers brother branham said if god is in your heart you can't wait to be where other christians are at you can't wait you can't stay home you can't just sit at home and because see it's not about us it's not about myself it's about serving you and you serving one another that's the way god intended it to be because why a love and because in our hearts we want to obey the word and we know what to do and so therefore when we when we get the holy ghost in us we can't go against the word because the spirit will lead you and guide you into all truth brother braham says it like this he said another fellow actually read out of this sermon last time and but he said quickening power he said this fellow had quickening power his name was philip he was so full of quickening power he was having a great big meeting down at samaria devils was being cast out people was baptized in the name of jesus christ they was having a real meeting and the spirit spoke to him on the dynamics come down and said leave this revival but what will the minister say don't make any difference what they say see he was full of quickening power he had the gasoline the dynamics was falling upon him he said go out into the desert and he found a eunuch there and baptized in the name of jesus christ one man who took the message down to ethiopia he said is that right and he obeyed god see he would have never found that man had he stayed at the big meeting but he had to go you have to go according to the word because somebody may miss a blessing because of your disobedience to the word in obedience to god if you have never been baptized in the name of jesus christ do it and watch the quickening power pick you up then you believe that have you been baptized then believe that the quickening power is yours god has already sent the holy ghost to the church we have to follow the prescription and it will come upon you he won't lose one of you when stephen done this great thing are not stephen but phillip done this great thing to leave that great revival and obey the commandments of god when he fulfilled by baptizing this eunuch in obedience to god he was so full of the quickening power till it caught him away you want a rapture follow the word that quickening power will take us all out of here have you followed the word in baptism then believe that the quickening power is there for you how do we get it obedience to the word you say well that's a rule that's a thing we have to do this is not something we have to do this is something we want to do because grace has taken place in our hearts when the word says to do a certain thing that's why we do it it's not because of it's not because there's a list of rules hanging on the back door it's not something back there you have to come to church and if you're late we're going to lock you out or if you don't come on wednesday nights you can't come on sundays or if you don't come on sunday morning you can't come to hear me on sunday nights but what it is is like this it's a love affair that is in your hearts you can't help but serve god you can't help but do what god wants you to do because the word has actually penetrated your heart and it has come into a way that that we say well well if i'm at home sick even sometimes you're like oh i miss church because i'm sick and maybe you had to but but but there's something in your heart that just longs to be with the other christians if that's not there it's time for a checkup in the church of god if there's not a love for the word of god if you can read the word of god and you say well i don't need that it's not for me then there's something wrong on the inside there's something we've got to do there's something we've got to change in our lives it's not the rules but we've heard the word we see it's been vindicated we follow the only message today that has a vindicated prophet to follow the only one we have the least we can do is obey what he said to do the least we can do is take the word of god and hold tight to it we see how the how you can be disobedient disobedient to the word and you can live like the world you see the chaos of the world and how they're acting and how how there's such darkness all around but we have literally had a light come in our hour and we can walk in that light and do what the light has showed us the light on this word you see it was open to us and when the bride has seen that open book then we can walk according to that word there's no doubts there's no fears there's nothing that can come upon us nothing can separate us from the love of god that is in christ jesus why because the word has been revealed to us you'll see people with bibles sitting on their shelves but there's not an open book there it's a closed book and i heard it said like this one time it's like it's got a seal upon it they can open the book they can see what it says but they don't know what it said it's like reading a book in a dark room you can open the book and you can feel the pages and turn them but if you can't see the words the light hasn't been shown on it yet but when the light comes on then we can see what the word says when the light comes on we can do what the word says if you want to be healed do what the word says come in obedience to the word and watch your family change come in obedience to your word watch your children act different they'll look at you well you used to not do that you used to not go to church and you used to not act like that you used to cuss and drink and smoke and all these things but listen when god really gets a hold of you it'll change you from the inside out and there'll be something come upon you where you can't do the things of the world you'll step out and you'll try to drink and you'll try to smoke it and as soon as you get a hold of that there'll be something on the inside that'll make you put it down why because a change has happened a change has come on the inside brother braham talks about the little dove and and how the the oil they oil themselves and and it comes from the inside is something that just completely just constantly happens and that's the way with a christian when the oil of the holy ghost is overflowing in you it it's constantly cleaning you up it's constantly bringing you under subjection to the word now the flesh may never be subject but the body will be different because something on the inside is starting to show on the outside and so you say well i can live any kind of life and be a christian but think about it like this god has put something on the inside of you not just to put it there not just to say well this one here will make it in the rapture but he's going to live like satan until then no god has given you the right to be partakers of his holiness partakers of his grace he has given you the authority to walk all over them devils that try to hold you back you have an authority this bride is equipped with everything it's not something we put back on a prophet it's not something we put into the future this is not something that's going to happen or what did happen it's something that's happening right now we get caught up in our in our slothfulness and and we we don't read the bible like we should and then when we do it's it's like well i've got to read the bible today because because a christian reads their bible but if you're just doing it just to do it and you're not actually reading what it says and doing what it says then maybe you're just wasting your time or god's time but listen when you see something and when the light has really struck you when you see it in the word it's not that hard to do what the word says but see there's a battle in the mind that tries to hold you back from what the word says to do there's something in the mind that tries to keep you from that why but there's an obedience there and it comes from more than rules it comes from more than what the pastor gets up here and says but the obedience comes from within because grace has taken a hold and by grace you have now been being able to obey the word of god think about it like this here when there was a man that come to jesus brother b was talking about this morning and he come and had he not put the mud on his eyes and had he not went down to the pool to wash he would have never received his healing jesus was standing there could have spoke the eyes into existence he didn't have to do anything but he did have to obey the word and it comes down like this no matter how foolish it sounds to preach the gospel when the bible says go into all the world and preach the gospel i don't care how foolish it sounds or how crazy it sounds i you say well we've got a better preacher over here or we've got a prophet we can just press play you go right on and do that but if you're denying the word of god that press and play won't do you no good but there's got to be more than just a rule more than just a time to come together and sit down and do our due diligence time to all come together and pray no i tell you if you want to pray before god when god puts the desire there and says kneel down before me and pray do it no matter where you're at no matter what time of the day it is we must believe the word sorry i'm yelling at you we've got to believe the word it's not and it's not rules i want to get that through through our heads and through our minds and our hearts it's not a rule brother brand because brother graham said we had to do a certain thing that's not why we do it we do it because our hearts have been sanctified by the word and now there is something on the inside that actually makes us do those things when we hear it it actually make you feel bad you ever had your toes stepped on i have you ever felt bad about something you did some little white lie you told me you didn't realize you told it but you said something and you didn't really get the facts of it so you said it and now all of a sudden you kind of come you now you have condemnation and when you have condemnation and you come to church it's condemnation upon condemnation upon condemnation and you sit there you're like well i'm not obeying this part of the word and i failed god in this manner and the next thing you know then you're just full of condemnation and you get nothing out of the service but if we can repent before god and come under subjection to the word of god even if we don't look like it yet even if you haven't had time to go repent yet do it in the heart first and then go make it right and come before the before god and say lord whatever your word says i'll do it i don't care if it's crazy i don't care if it costs me money i don't care if it costs me prestige or status i will do what the word of god says can somebody say yes lord i'll do your word yes lord is all we have to do is say yes when the spirit of the lord comes upon you dance like david dance when the spirit of the lord comes upon you do what the spirit says to do he the hath and ear let him hear what the spirit says to the church i believe there's a spirit here today that can tell you what you have need of i believe that god is still an ever-present help when you have trouble i believe that when you have depression and sickness there's still a god who is the healer of all your diseases it doesn't matter what you've been through what you're going to go through there could be something horrible happen tomorrow that you don't even know about but god's got you god has already seen it he knows what's going to happen and he's already there to take care of it you say why would god let me do this why would he why would he hurt me and why would he allow me to be hurt like this because sometimes he wants to see if you can hold on abraham and sarah had to hold on for a long time but the word of god did come to pass and it'll still come to pass for you but you have to obey it well that was for another day we don't preach no more we don't do these things no more but through the foolishness of me standing up here and slobbering all over the place somebody could be saved through the foolishness of a person getting up here and looking like an idiot you could be saved through the foolishness god saw something good could come out of it a broken life something that looked horrible to the world you could have been in drugs and alcohol you could have had a divorced family and maybe you've lost loved ones but there's something that god has got in store for you when you can come under subjection to the word of god he's a god of second chances we've questioned we failed to believe but he's still been faithful anyway through it all god is faithful what we want is not always what god wants us to have what we want is not always the will of god what we want to do is not always in god's plans and we think that we think that god's not allowing us to do something when god is trying to tug at us a little bit say let's go let's do this see and let's go and we can be clean let's go this way and god will have a blessing for you do you believe that tonight god has something in store for every one of us but you've got to believe and then act upon what you believe see they would come in the prayer line and they would come and brother braham said do you believe and they would mostly i would say yes they would say yes yes i believe but see you can say that but do you really believe sometimes he would say if you believe that stomach condition go eat your supper now if i said no i can't go eat because it's going to affect me then i didn't really believe in the first place you remember john ryan he come to the prayer line and brother bram said he was healed and he went up there and he set the balcony a little bit and he come back in the prayer line again and he said brother graham you said i was healed and i still can't see but the brahman said you said you believed me see that's the problem right there god allowed him to be put through a test and every son or daughter that comes to god must be tested you've got to be tried will you make that decision because there is a part for you to play it is grace that has brought you here and grace will lead you home but you do have to believe the word of god and if you believe the word of god god will is obligated to back up the word there is an obligation that god has as well it's not just on us but it's on god also so when god has given us the word and he's given it to us in so many forms we don't have an excuse in this age of anything we have the written word we have the spoken word we have it on our phones we have it on our computers we have it everywhere anywhere you want it you can get the word of god 24 hours a day seven days a week and not every country has that privilege but we become slothful worshipers we become so so it becomes common to us the word of god has become so common that we we just take it or we leave it if the preacher says something and we agree with it well i've heard that before but maybe you need to hear it again or god wouldn't put it on the man's heart you say well i know all these things i would say that most most people in here would know most of the message and you know most of the scriptures but it must be preached in the power and the demonstration and in the foolishness because god still has something for you god still has something for you can say hebrews 13 8 over and over but it's still true you can say you can say well god sent a prophet i don't care who i hear that from i still say amen to it because he did we've witnessed it in this day we witnessed the word of god and his power in this day but it didn't stop with him it's still in the bride of christ it didn't stop with brother branham it didn't stop with your pastor it didn't stop when there was one man that failed you it won't stop when the next one fails you but god is still god and he's still here to bring to pass his word all we have to do is believe it but if you really believe it you will act on it brother braham says this he said that ought to tear the heart he's talking about when we see the atonement and the blood of christ that ought to tear the heart of any sinner to realize that christ becomes sin that you through righteousness of his obedience to god might become him in the presence of god let me say that again that you through righteousness of his obedience jesus had to obey the will of the father or none of us would have the plan of salvation we have you say well i don't have to obey the word jesus himself had to obey the word of god or would everyone be lost today his obedience to god might become excuse me that's you through the righteousness of his obedience to god might become him in the presence of god to stand without blemish think about it i can become him before god amen i hope you can really get that because of his obedience he took my place so that i could become him i can become christ the word myself i am the portion of god i am the portion of christ on the earth the body of christ why because of his obedience because of what he did nothing i could do but the least i could do was say because he was willing to take the cross then i'll pick up my little cross every day i'll take the word of god i'll take the way with the despised few because i'm going to go through with jesus to the end i won't stop i won't give up there's nothing going to stop me now because god's word is here and he's made me a son of god and i can stand with no sin at all before god i can stand completely redeemed before god he became sin took the sin question out of us we can break the word drink tell dirty joke just lie not even bad in our eyes sometimes that tells you that there's not been the nature change that we must have we've got to have the true word of god living in us that's the only way to obedience if you follow it by a rule if i'm told to do something and i don't believe it in my heart i may do it for a little bit but i won't continue in that way if i know to do right and don't do it it becomes a sin what is sin the prophet taught us that is unbelief smoking and drinking and all these things is no different than just saying i'm not going to gather with the elected on sunday morning no it's no different you say well i can't do this and i can't do that it's no different to disbelieve one word of god than it is to smoke or drink no different it's all unbelief now if you don't know to do right then there's a difference there but if you know to do it then it becomes sin to you you say well that's hard it's the word it's the truth anyway it hurts me sometimes it hurts you sometimes maybe but when the word of god is made flesh before you you being made flesh before god then you must believe what the word says and when you become part of the word how can you disbelieve how can you not believe what you are i am the word of god made manifest how could i disbelieve that because the very word of god that came in our day and proved that that that he could put on he could create squirrels the very word of god that came in our day and proved that all these things could happen all the miracles could happen he could discern the secrets of the hearts and all these things could happen if i believe that to be true then i have to believe that jesus christ was the same then and in between and now and he'll still be that same christ tomorrow why because i've seen i've heard now i've got to act upon it i see the word of god to be true i see the message of the hour to be revealed now let me to go and live it now if i don't to reject it is what it's judgment but to receive it is life there's grace for you right there to receive the word is life to receive the whole word is the life of christ living through you because it is the word of god have we fallen in love with christ where we can't help but obey the word have we fallen in love with god so much you can't help but you make a mistake you do something wrong he said lord forgive me immediately you can't just go around sinning and not feel bad about it if there's a holy spirit inside of you it will make you act different it will make you do things different now it may not happen overnight because your body has to come under subjection but there will be a change and it may be gradual i may not see it you may not see it but only you know if god is dealing with your heart and if he is there will take change there will take a change little by little and as someday you will come in to the full maturity of the life of christ because why you are part of him you are already in christ now because you've taken on the word of god we've lost the feeling sometimes for for god we've grown cold sometimes in our prayer life maybe it's time for a checkup for every one of us you see are you preaching to me i'm preaching to myself maybe i need to check my prayer life do i need to pray more yes i do do i need to get down before god more yes i do the prophet of god said a christian reads his bible and prays every day i need to do more of that you said but now it doesn't come from just doing the deed but believing what you're reading an action will follow an action will follow i want to live this life according to the word of god brotherham says this and i'm about to run out of time so i'll close shortly he said why he's in his church universal the great holy apostolic pentecostal catholic church what a name around the world jesus in every member and every member he was only in one man god was then now god's in his whole church right this hour people's being healed somebody right here i believe can be healed right now why because christ is in this universal church he's not a god of far off he's a god it's a present god he's a present help in the time of trouble right this very minute people's receiving the holy ghost you believe that people can be refilled with that same holy ghost here tonight do you believe that if he was just standing here alone in a man form as he was then he could only be talking to this audience but now he talks the world over by the holy ghost he's speaking through individuals all over the world by the holy ghost he's speaking to you right now by the holy ghost he says is it you speaking no it may be something right in here talking to you it's the holy ghost in you that is saying yes that's true i need to do that lord help me obey and line my life up to the word not something i have to do but something i want to do a life i want to live i want to live the way he wants me to live i want to give to god's people the way he gave to god's people nobody gave a better sacrifice but he went in obedience to the word of god so there she was she's talking about this prostitute woman and we'll be closing shortly she's talking about this little woman is washing his feet there she was in his presence she moved around i can see those little eyes look at her and her heart nearly failed there's the man that forgive that woman and note her heart he knew that woman of samaria he knew she had five husbands he knows how guilty i am he does he knows how guilty i am he knows how guilty you are he knows just how low down every one of us are he knows us she looked him in the face and she recognized it now she never looked over at the pharisees or looked at the charts to see how many members belonged to the church whether she joined it or not she looked at jesus and she felt guilty listen church can you look at the blood of christ or the sacrifice we have and not feel a little guilty if you can you need a checkup she couldn't hold her tears any longer she looked down at his feet and the tears began to drop off on his feet she was so ashamed she fell down on her knees she and he'd seen her she couldn't hold her tears any longer there's something about when you get around jesus you start crying not some cold not some starchy cold confessions and putting your name on the book and joining the church you've got to die to yourself and be born anew can you die out to yourself no but he can bring a spirit into you that can cause the old nature to die and the new life of christ can take hold of you something that god does and what we do is yield to him and the word will take an effect in our lives that was preached in the message the meanest man i know you ever known any of those no matter how far you've gone there's still a way back no matter what you've done there's still forgiveness if you repent no matter how far that little woman went into sin when she seen jesus she repented in her heart maybe she didn't say a word to him maybe she couldn't say nothing in the moment but there was something inside of her a broken and a contrite heart it wasn't no cold form formal stiff neck person that come down to the altar and they come down for a show and they get up and they fix their coat and walk back to their seat why because she had seen jesus and i can't help but look out here tonight and see a part of christ sitting in the building and i can't help but think if he can forgive you and he can forgive me then he can forgive the lowest sinner in the city if we can forgive and we can repent and we can go forward into the word of god and believe that the word of god is still real and is still on the throne the god of abraham isaac and jacob the god that come down and came in the flesh of jesus was the same god that's here today he came down on the prophet and he showed us that christ was alive that he's still god god never died he's still god he had no beginning he has no end he's still here living in and through you today when the holy ghost comes inside of you it will change your life jesus said if you love me do what i say brother branham talks about it and this is not in my notes so i'll be careful jesus brother bram talks about when you say you believe and you don't do what you say you're just a liar and the truth is not in you there's nothing there's nothing worse than a person that says i believe everything the bible says and then when it says assemble yourselves together oh but that was for the apostles when it says and i hope you're hearing me i know you're tired i'll close shortly i hope if not you can set me down shortly he said when you think about this when the people brother branham said that in the baptist i i was able to talk to a man one time and he said well the the apostles were sent to go out and go into all the world and preach the gospel but that's not for us these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out devils do you believe that's true if it's true it's still happening anything god ever put in the church is still in the church it still has an effect on the people it's still true because it's the word of god and if god can't change his word can't change nothing can change as the musicians come i wasn't kidding let us stand together brother branham says this in a prayer and this struck my heart he said our heavenly father we thank thee for every gracious word that's written in this bible seeing that we are compassed about with such a great of cloud of witness two and a half million people died perishing in the wilderness of unbelief and only two that believed was permitted to go over father god i pray you help us to see that and look to what it means let us not be disbelievers in thy word but may we not only be hearers but doers of the word he said grant it lord can we say granted lord i don't want to just i don't want to just hear the word i want to go act on it i don't want to just be a so-called message believer i want to live the message let the message come in me and live through me to where when the world looks at me yes i may look different i may look strange but i can tell you this there's going to be a day when we're all gathered in a rapture not in this place or that place but universal rapture and we're going to look strange maybe then too one another we're going to start seeing body changes take place but think about it when you believe the word there's a reward for that believing that's coming amen and i believe we can also be blessed now through healing through the holy ghost moving in the services the presence of the lord settling among us by believing and obeying the word of god let's bow our heads as musicians would play something brother braham says this i'll just read it as they're playing he's what we need today is some old-fashioned revivals some sweeping revivals [Music] power of the lord we need men and women who's willing to sell out to everything in this world to burn every bridge behind them we need to take the world today we ministers like the old norwegians used to take a country when they went in by ship and they hit the shore and set the ship of fire and burned it behind them they had no way of escape that's the way we ought to do it burn every bridge and every escape sell out everything for the kingdom of god and keep moving on there's no place of stopping there's no place for compromising but we can believe the whole word of god do you believe with all your hearts your heavenly father lord as we come this service lord lord if there's an unbelieving spirit if there's a doubt in the heart of a person here maybe they've struggled like naaman but nevertheless that's your word he went ahead and did it anyway though it sounded foolish when he went down the seventh time he come up with the skin like of a child it was soft it was new it was healed [Music] we obey the word of god i believe even now that word of god can take an effect in our lives and make us anew we can be cleansed go thou and be clean may we take this word and go believing acting and receive our blessing in jesus name if there's one in here who's dealing with a spirit of unbelief let this be the day when you cast that unbelief down he's still a god of second chances he's still a god [Music] not of rules but of grace he can forgive you for that unbelieving spirit if there's one if you would slip your hand up to him i believe there's a god here who will answer that prayer today as we sing that to him he became he became me so that i might become him my grain he became [Music] you believe he took your place yes he took my place [Music] you believe that he took your place so that we could be free this afternoon he [Music] became me so that i might become my grace [Music] became me [Music] so that i will become him by grace [Music] took my place aren't you thankful for it he took my place so that i through his love could be part of that body of christ [Music] so that is [Music] amen do you believe the word can cleanse you from that unbelieving spirit today i believe if we just take a hold of god's word and believe it with all our hearts and act upon it i believe god can do something special for every one of you not just today but tomorrow and throughout the week lay in the presence of the message of the hour get into your bibles and read the word and really take it to heart so that when something strikes that word when the light strikes the word you can say that's me in the word there's that story little boy looked in the mirror never seen himself before or never seen a mirror before and looks in that mirror mama that's me when i saw my name in the book i said that's me i don't have to be be struggling with that demon of unbelief but i can be the believing word born bride member part of jesus christ do you believe it with all your hearts sing it to him now oh he became [Music] he became me so that i might become him by grace he took my place so that i through his love could take his [Music] he became me so that i might become him by grace and
