[45:59] been through a lot i took him out to eat
[46:02] and we caught up a little bit the other
[46:03] day and
[46:04] while i ran some errands from the for
[46:06] the church he he went with me and
[46:08] our conversation turned towards god and
[46:10] i knew that he hadn't been serving the
[46:12] lord for a while
[46:14] and we started talking about it and
[46:18] and he's done differently in his life
[46:21] then you know it seemed like you come to
[46:23] a certain spot and everybody grows up
[46:24] together and then you go
[46:26] your own way and and he looked at my
[46:29] life he said you know he said i know
[46:31] you've always wanted to serve people and
[46:32] you've always wanted to live for god
[46:34] he said i can see you've done that and i
[46:37] said
[46:38] i said you know what to my friend i said
[46:40] you know i've always wanted to be the
[46:41] same
[46:42] person no matter where i i was and and
[46:44] what i've done and
[46:46] i always wanted to have that same heart
[46:48] for god that i always did
[46:49] and we ran around together 20 years ago
[46:52] and he could see that was the same
[46:55] and i could see things in his life had
[46:56] changed
[46:58] and he had gotten to a point where now
[47:01] he what he does for a living is he plays
[47:04] in bars and
[47:05] clubs and
[47:09] trying to make it in the music industry
[47:12] and as we begin to talk he said you know
[47:14] he said based on what i've seen
[47:17] based on my experience with god or what
[47:20] i've seen god
[47:21] do he said i'd have to say i'm an
[47:24] atheist
[47:27] and it really made me think
[47:32] because he's not even sure that god
[47:35] exists
[47:37] and he told me as if it was an
[47:39] afterthought and it broke my heart
[47:42] because it was like an afterthought you
[47:43] know i'm i think i'm an atheist
[47:46] i'm not even sure that god still exists
[47:50] and
[47:50] you see if you if you can't see that god
[47:53] does anything
[47:55] then you if you can't see what he's
[47:57] doing then you don't know if he's real
[48:01] just saying what he did yesterday is not
[48:03] enough of a
[48:05] of a of an affirmation to your heart and
[48:08] your soul in your own life
[48:09] that he is real you have to be able to
[48:13] see what he is
[48:15] today
[48:19] and so forgive me for being personal
[48:20] there for a moment but it just really
[48:22] struck me
[48:23] i'm not even sure that god
[48:27] exists and and many people and i think
[48:30] all of us today would say we know god
[48:32] exists
[48:33] but at the same time it's important that
[48:37] we continue to see what he's doing
[48:40] because if we lose sight of what he's
[48:41] doing and who he is and
[48:43] and how he's working it's good to see
[48:45] you brother ronnie this morning as well
[48:47] but if we lose sight of that we become
[48:50] in some ways a de facto atheist
[48:53] and it's someone who who believes in god
[48:57] but you couldn't tell it by the way that
[48:59] they live
[49:01] right and you've known people like that
[49:03] they would never maybe
[49:04] come admit that like to you like my
[49:07] friend did but they would say
[49:08] i believe in god i believe god is real
[49:11] they may even say i believe the message
[49:14] but act as if the message never came
[49:17] right there by their life you you
[49:19] couldn't tell it
[49:21] by what they did and and so they would
[49:24] be a de facto atheist and in some ways
[49:26] that's worse
[49:28] because there's a deception in that when
[49:29] you don't know
[49:31] that you don't believe in god
[49:35] so and i'm not trying to say that to be
[49:37] harsh to you but to get to a point today
[49:39] we have to be able to see
[49:40] what god is doing today because if we
[49:44] if we can't see that we lose our
[49:46] understanding of our
[49:47] place and our position in christ and his
[49:49] work among us and we eventually
[49:51] begin to wonder does he even exist
[49:55] and so peter stood up on the day of
[49:57] pentecost and before
[49:59] god had been a something that happened
[50:01] to the israelites years before and
[50:03] they could tell you about the red sea
[50:05] they could tell you about everything
[50:06] that had happened
[50:07] but peter stood up on the day of
[50:08] pentecost he said this is what god
[50:10] is doing today what you see
[50:14] these these men and women that have come
[50:16] down out of an upper room
[50:17] speaking in in in tongues that they
[50:20] don't even know and the people hearing
[50:21] that was the miracle
[50:22] was in the hearing but the people
[50:24] hearing them speak in their own language
[50:26] he said this is that them staggering out
[50:30] like drunk men and all the things that
[50:32] happened that day he said this
[50:33] is that that was spoken of in the
[50:36] scripture he said here it is in the word
[50:39] and here it is in flesh
[50:42] right and so that's where we have to be
[50:44] here it is in the word here it is
[50:46] in flesh i have to be able to identify
[50:48] where i'm at
[50:50] i have to be able to identify what the
[50:53] word says about today
[50:55] in order to know that he's real
[51:00] you know people don't usually stay
[51:01] lukewarm forever
[51:04] eventually they lose their consciousness
[51:06] of god
[51:08] and and so for a while they'll say well
[51:10] i believe god but eventually you watch
[51:11] people that leave the message
[51:13] most of the time they end up atheists
[51:16] because once you've reasoned away the
[51:18] message you can also reason away the
[51:19] bible
[51:21] using the same methods and so they do
[51:24] that they end up atheists not even
[51:26] believing in god at all
[51:27] and so people lose their their
[51:29] consciousness of god
[51:31] and in romans chapter 1 paul talks about
[51:33] that in verse 20
[51:35] he says for the invisible things of him
[51:37] from the creation of the world are
[51:38] clearly seen
[51:39] being understood by the things that are
[51:41] made he said you should be able to know
[51:43] just by nature itself
[51:46] that there is a god nature itself should
[51:49] teach you that
[51:51] that there is a god and i'm so grateful
[51:53] that god made these things that we know
[51:55] that he's real because we see it
[51:57] i told my friend the other day i don't
[51:59] have enough faith to not believe in god
[52:02] so paul indicts the gentile world who'd
[52:06] never heard the true gospel
[52:08] but he says just by the fact that they
[52:10] they should have known there was a god
[52:13] they should have known who he was
[52:15] because he said they're without excuse
[52:17] because the things that are made reveal
[52:19] him verse 21 because that when they knew
[52:22] god so they knew god at one time
[52:25] but they glorified him not as god
[52:28] and we could stop there and i could
[52:29] preach the rest of the service just on
[52:31] that
[52:32] because if you know god and you don't
[52:34] glorify him as god
[52:35] you eventually will deny that he is
[52:41] if you know the message and you won't do
[52:43] what the message says
[52:45] eventually you'll deny the message is
[52:47] real
[52:50] it's true and and so he said they knew
[52:53] god but then they
[52:54] they refused to glorify him as god
[52:57] in other words they they did not place
[52:59] him in his position
[53:00] where he should be of worship where he
[53:02] should be of glory where he should be
[53:05] on the throne room of their heart and
[53:07] because they did not put him in the
[53:08] place where he should be in their lives
[53:10] they eventually said he doesn't even
[53:12] exist or they
[53:14] changed him into something else that was
[53:17] less than god
[53:20] so he said they become vain they
[53:21] glorified him not as god neither were
[53:23] thankful
[53:25] just the fact that they were ungrateful
[53:28] for what he did
[53:29] well i pray that god would never let us
[53:31] become that way but that we would remain
[53:33] grateful lord
[53:34] i've been through a lot but i know that
[53:36] you've intervened in my life
[53:38] i know you've moved i know you've
[53:40] brought me to the place where i'm at
[53:41] today
[53:42] even after all these things have gone on
[53:44] but i know that you're real because i've
[53:46] seen you
[53:47] work in my life so he said
[53:50] they weren't thankful but become vain in
[53:52] their imaginations
[53:54] and their foolish heart was darkened
[53:56] professing themselves to be wise they
[53:59] became
[53:59] fools so the more wise they become
[54:03] they became fools and changed the glory
[54:05] of the uncorruptable god
[54:07] and notice how it descends here first
[54:10] was the uncorruptable god
[54:12] they changed it into an image made like
[54:14] the corruptable man
[54:15] and to birds and the four-footed beasts
[54:18] and the creeping things
[54:20] they brought it all the way down from
[54:22] heavenly things until god could be no
[54:24] more than an ant
[54:26] or or a beast crawling across the ground
[54:30] a serpent
[54:34] wherefore god also gave them up to
[54:35] uncleanness through the lust of their
[54:37] own heart to dishonor
[54:38] their own bodies between themselves do
[54:41] you see how this happened
[54:42] it happened because of a loss of god
[54:45] consciousness
[54:46] because of a loss of understanding of
[54:48] what god is doing today
[54:50] that's how the world got where it's at
[54:53] right and so it says to dishonor their
[54:56] own bodies between themselves who
[54:57] changed the truth of god into a lie
[55:00] and worshiped and served the creature
[55:02] more than the creator who was blessed
[55:05] forever so they knew god
[55:09] but denied his power paul puts it this
[55:12] way he said having a
[55:13] form of godliness but denying the power
[55:16] thereof
[55:17] from such turn away now
[55:21] we we want to know what god is doing
[55:23] today
[55:24] and god is doing something god is
[55:27] working in the earth today what is he
[55:28] doing today we have to know
[55:31] and we know that all the works of god
[55:33] are written in the word of god
[55:38] and they were revealed to us at the
[55:40] opening of the 7th field book of
[55:42] revelation 10 so we know we don't
[55:44] we're not looking at a partially
[55:46] revealed word
[55:48] but a but an open book and what a
[55:52] confidence that gives
[55:53] us today that we can we can say
[55:56] i can order my life according to the
[55:58] word i can i can have the holy spirit
[56:00] work in my life in such a way because
[56:02] because i know that the book is open and
[56:04] i don't have to have these questions
[56:06] anymore
[56:07] if there's a question i can find an
[56:09] answer to it because the book is open
[56:11] and so
[56:12] he he opened the seven seal book of
[56:14] revelations 10 which was opened by
[56:16] christ himself revealed to the prophet
[56:18] who the word comes to
[56:20] now is given to the bride to know
[56:23] right now brother brown says that he
[56:26] said being a believer in the scripture
[56:28] he said i think that there's no meeting
[56:30] complete without the reading of the word
[56:33] he said the word is god's foundation he
[56:35] said i believe all doctrines everything
[56:37] should come exactly from the word of god
[56:40] and i i recognize that one day and i use
[56:43] this a lot but
[56:44] brother brown said the reason that the
[56:46] beast come out of the bottomless pit in
[56:48] revelation was because there was no
[56:49] foundation to his doctrine
[56:51] because his doctrines were not biblical
[56:54] right so every bible doctrine has to be
[56:56] biblical
[56:58] right and so he says i believe that god
[57:00] can do things it's not written in the
[57:01] word because he's god but as long as i
[57:03] know
[57:03] that i'm just following what he said he
[57:05] would do then i know i'm right
[57:08] as long as he said he would do it
[57:11] amen i know i'm right when i'm preaching
[57:13] about the holy ghost
[57:14] i know i'm right when i preach about
[57:16] about the the prophet coming why because
[57:18] god interpreted his word
[57:20] i know i'm right when i preach about the
[57:22] things that that have happened in our
[57:23] hour and the things happening today
[57:26] because the word of god says so right
[57:30] and
[57:30] so now he said i believe he said he said
[57:33] then i know i'm right as long as he said
[57:34] he would do it now
[57:35] the bible tells us there would be a time
[57:37] of the end you'll find that in daniel 12
[57:39] and 9 and i won't go back over all of
[57:40] this because we've been through it
[57:41] recently
[57:42] but daniel 12 9 says that these things
[57:45] would be sealed up to the time of the
[57:46] end
[57:47] and then in we find that two things were
[57:50] to happen the great falling away of
[57:52] sec of ii thessalonians 2 3 also a
[57:55] restoration prophet of malachi 4 5 and
[57:58] 6.
[57:59] so before that day comes there had to be
[58:01] a falling away
[58:02] we've seen that the church nominal falls
[58:05] into darkness
[58:06] and then there's a falling away even
[58:08] from the truth
[58:09] of the hour so we've seen that great
[58:12] falling away
[58:13] we've seen that church that that modern
[58:16] church go
[58:16] into utter darkness now if we if we
[58:20] you know if you just wonder what's got
[58:21] doing today and you begin to look and
[58:23] see what time is it
[58:24] where is the church at where is the
[58:27] world at
[58:28] brown said if you want to know how a
[58:31] church is doing look at the women and
[58:32] that's kind of an odd thing to say but
[58:34] he's
[58:34] typing it to a church look at the church
[58:36] look how they are
[58:38] look at the condition today of the
[58:40] church which is totally disassociated
[58:42] belief
[58:43] from practice they've completely removed
[58:47] it
[58:48] where it doesn't matter how you live
[58:49] anymore but they've gone into complete
[58:51] and utter darkness following a witch
[58:53] brother adam said
[58:54] down but it's during that same time that
[58:56] the bride is going up
[58:59] amen during that same time by the
[59:01] steward we have
[59:02] a promise that we can go up
[59:06] now so this has already taken place
[59:11] the prophets already came and did just
[59:14] like
[59:14] john when he come jesus said he's
[59:16] already come and they did to him what
[59:18] was written and he's already come and
[59:22] people have already accepted or rejected
[59:24] the message and
[59:26] and the world you know you can't say he
[59:27] wasn't a prophet today the world then
[59:29] said he was right the world of that day
[59:33] understood he was a prophet
[59:36] and they can't disprove that so they try
[59:38] to disprove what god is doing right now
[59:42] but look the falling away is is complete
[59:45] the prophet has come and gone now where
[59:48] are we
[59:50] now if you look at it scripturally it
[59:52] places us at the end
[59:54] just before and not just at the end but
[59:57] we can say the end of the end
[59:59] because the mystery's already been
[1:00:01] revealed
[1:00:04] and so now this we we find ourselves
[1:00:07] just before the the complete fulfillment
[1:00:09] of first corinthians 15 51
[1:00:11] where he said behold i show you a
[1:00:13] mystery we shall not all sleep
[1:00:15] but we shall all be changed amen
[1:00:18] in a moment in the twinkling of an eye
[1:00:20] at the last trump for the trumpet shall
[1:00:22] sound
[1:00:22] and the dead shall be raised
[1:00:24] incorruptible and we shall be
[1:00:26] changed what a promise that is
[1:00:31] what a promise that is what a
[1:00:33] consolation we shall
[1:00:35] be changed and so
[1:00:38] brother branham talks about how that man
[1:00:41] can see what god is going to do because
[1:00:43] we know that that
[1:00:43] full fullness of that is in the future
[1:00:46] the change of the body
[1:00:47] we know that the prophet has come and
[1:00:48] gone in the past
[1:00:50] and yet his message is alive today the
[1:00:52] message that he brought which was a
[1:00:53] message from the throne of god the
[1:00:56] message is still alive but the prophet
[1:00:58] has come and gone so we know that
[1:00:59] we're living in that time and and we
[1:01:02] know that
[1:01:03] this is the time when and brother
[1:01:05] branham talks about this over and over
[1:01:07] he deals with how
[1:01:08] man is constantly praising god for what
[1:01:10] he has done
[1:01:11] and this is in the spirit of truth he
[1:01:13] said he's always saying what he will do
[1:01:15] and then at the same time ignoring what
[1:01:17] he's doing
[1:01:19] right and brother branham goes through
[1:01:22] this and
[1:01:22] gives us some examples and i'm going to
[1:01:24] read several places where he says this
[1:01:26] he said man will say oh god opened up
[1:01:28] the red sea yes glory to god that's
[1:01:30] right
[1:01:31] yes jesus is coming again hallelujah
[1:01:33] that's right but talk about him today
[1:01:36] he said oh that was for another day see
[1:01:37] always what he has done what he will do
[1:01:39] and ignore what he's doing
[1:01:41] and and in the sixth seal brother the
[1:01:43] rem says here we are these
[1:01:44] denominationals twisted up
[1:01:45] they take all the glory and power place
[1:01:47] it back with the apostles and the rest
[1:01:49] of it over in the millennium
[1:01:50] he said it's just like a man as i said
[1:01:52] before a man is always giving god praise
[1:01:55] for what he has done
[1:01:56] looking forward to what he will do and
[1:01:57] ignoring what he's doing right now
[1:01:59] that's exactly man it's still the same
[1:02:01] thing
[1:02:02] and if we continue to do that guess
[1:02:04] where you're putting yourself
[1:02:06] as a de facto atheist oh i believe in
[1:02:10] god but he doesn't do anything
[1:02:12] i believe in god but he doesn't know
[1:02:14] what i'm doing i believe in god but it
[1:02:16] just
[1:02:17] there's no movement there's nothing
[1:02:18] happening you know it's just we've seen
[1:02:20] it in the past we've seen it in the
[1:02:21] future but god is doing something today
[1:02:24] but i want to tell you right up front
[1:02:26] we're not looking for another prophet
[1:02:28] we're not looking for another
[1:02:29] denomination that's not what's promised
[1:02:32] in the word
[1:02:33] we're not looking for another time even
[1:02:35] a great worldwide revival we're not
[1:02:37] looking for that
[1:02:39] what are we what are we looking for
[1:02:41] we're looking for a rapture coming
[1:02:43] what's happening today
[1:02:47] something's happening god's moving
[1:02:51] he may be moving in a different way than
[1:02:53] we expected he may there may be things
[1:02:55] happening that's different than what we
[1:02:57] expected
[1:02:57] don't ever assume that god is not in
[1:03:00] control
[1:03:00] because you lost control
[1:03:05] we want to control the events of our
[1:03:07] lives and have everything set up the way
[1:03:09] we want and then things
[1:03:10] begin to spin out of our control but
[1:03:12] when it spins out of our control
[1:03:14] it's in his control
[1:03:19] and so brother branham says he's
[1:03:22] ignoring what he's doing
[1:03:24] he said that's exactly man always
[1:03:27] he said and he does the same thing today
[1:03:30] he always is that
[1:03:32] he said a man he said you've got to get
[1:03:34] out of that he said you've got to let
[1:03:36] the mind that was in christ
[1:03:37] be in you and then greater than solomon
[1:03:41] is here
[1:03:42] brother brown says listen to this remark
[1:03:46] listen to this remark man is constantly
[1:03:48] praising god for what he has done
[1:03:51] looking forward to what he uh
[1:03:54] what he will do and ignoring what he's
[1:03:57] doing
[1:03:58] he said that's the status of mankind
[1:04:01] he always did that and the same thing is
[1:04:04] tonight
[1:04:05] he says men look over and look back and
[1:04:08] see what god does and talk about a great
[1:04:10] god back yonder
[1:04:12] he says at pentecost and looking for a
[1:04:15] great day of millennium when he will
[1:04:16] come again
[1:04:17] and ignoring his very being he said in
[1:04:21] the presence of his people
[1:04:23] listen making ready for that millennium
[1:04:27] they ignore it it's just the nature of
[1:04:29] people
[1:04:30] to do that again in certain we would see
[1:04:34] jesus brother brown says it seems to be
[1:04:35] a spiritual condition of the church
[1:04:37] that they fail to see the hour that
[1:04:39] they're living they're looking for some
[1:04:41] sensation or something way off in the
[1:04:42] future
[1:04:43] man is forever doing that he always
[1:04:45] blesses god for what he has done
[1:04:47] looking forward for what he will do and
[1:04:49] ignoring what he's doing
[1:04:51] he said you failed to see the hour that
[1:04:54] we're living
[1:04:56] so what is he doing today what is
[1:04:59] happening according to the scripture
[1:05:02] what he's doing today and i'll bring you
[1:05:04] the scripture and the quotes on this but
[1:05:07] i want you to think with me think with
[1:05:10] me pinch yourself if you have to
[1:05:13] wake up a little bit and you're sitting
[1:05:14] at home the same because he is doing
[1:05:17] something today but what is he doing
[1:05:20] he's dressing the bride in the fullness
[1:05:22] of the word
[1:05:24] and he's bringing individuals to the
[1:05:26] same place of maturity that the word has
[1:05:28] already reached
[1:05:30] because the word doesn't have to mature
[1:05:32] anymore
[1:05:35] it's already come we've already been
[1:05:36] through all seven ages
[1:05:40] and that's why we don't have to go
[1:05:41] seeking another revelation or another
[1:05:43] thing coming because
[1:05:44] that's the word has come to maturity
[1:05:47] and we even saw it in an individual in
[1:05:49] our hour that god
[1:05:51] brought him to a place of maturity so
[1:05:54] that we could see an example of what god
[1:05:56] is doing
[1:05:58] i hope you're hearing me now we could
[1:06:00] see what god is doing and then he came
[1:06:02] and he left
[1:06:04] and then we said well where are we well
[1:06:06] we're coming to that same place of
[1:06:07] maturity
[1:06:10] right now we know and i didn't have time
[1:06:14] this morning maybe we'll get into it in
[1:06:15] the future but
[1:06:16] you could go and look at all the things
[1:06:17] brother branham said about the wheat and
[1:06:19] he said i hear the coming of the combine
[1:06:21] he said lay in the presence of the sun
[1:06:23] for the ripening and so that is the time
[1:06:26] or the hour that we live in is that it's
[1:06:28] this time if you look out
[1:06:30] at the country today i know brother bill
[1:06:32] this morning is
[1:06:33] they're working on harvesting their
[1:06:35] crops
[1:06:36] and i noticed the other day that the
[1:06:38] weatherman you know they've been calling
[1:06:39] wanting rain wanting rain wanting rain
[1:06:41] he said no he said don't look for rain
[1:06:42] no more
[1:06:43] we don't want no rain because the
[1:06:44] farmers are all harvesting
[1:06:47] and so they're they're saying we're
[1:06:48] hoping for no rain in the coming weeks
[1:06:51] why because they want to get the the
[1:06:53] crops out
[1:06:55] you don't want moisture in this hour you
[1:06:58] don't want
[1:06:59] greenness in this time are you with me
[1:07:02] now
[1:07:03] so god is dealing with us in a very
[1:07:05] mature way
[1:07:08] he's dealing with us in a very mature
[1:07:09] way i hope you're listening to me this
[1:07:11] morning
[1:07:12] he's allowing things maybe to happen and
[1:07:14] things to take place among us
[1:07:15] even this coronavirus everything
[1:07:16] happening he's dealing with us in a
[1:07:18] mature way
[1:07:20] in a way that maybe past ages and places
[1:07:22] maybe they couldn't have handled it but
[1:07:24] he's dealing with us
[1:07:25] in a very mature way because we've got
[1:07:27] to be ready
[1:07:29] amen so we've he wants us to reach that
[1:07:32] place of maturity so now
[1:07:35] we know that in this hour that the
[1:07:36] condition of the bride at the end time
[1:07:39] will be the opposite of that of the
[1:07:41] condition of those who have fallen away
[1:07:46] look they've committed adultery on
[1:07:48] christ
[1:07:49] but she is a true virgin bride
[1:07:53] washed for the bleeding word her sins
[1:07:56] so she never did it in the first place
[1:07:58] her old husband done away with
[1:08:00] everything
[1:08:01] it's done away with aren't you glad we
[1:08:02] serve a god like that
[1:08:04] so here she is a true virgin bride and
[1:08:07] but they have committed adultery on
[1:08:08] christ they
[1:08:09] go farther and farther into satan's eden
[1:08:12] we're going the other direction
[1:08:16] now and he foretold that in ephesians 5
[1:08:20] 25 this is what he's doing he said
[1:08:22] husbands love your wives even as christ
[1:08:24] also loved the church and gave himself
[1:08:26] for it that he might sanctify and
[1:08:28] cleanse it
[1:08:29] with the washing of water by the word
[1:08:32] that he might present it to himself
[1:08:35] i'm so glad he does that he might
[1:08:38] present it to himself
[1:08:41] oh that gives me hope because i don't
[1:08:43] have very many talents in the natural
[1:08:45] but he's going to present it to himself
[1:08:49] a glorious church not having spot he
[1:08:52] said a wrinkle or any such
[1:08:53] thing but that it should be holy without
[1:08:56] blemish
[1:08:58] so he's saying that the bride is coming
[1:09:00] to her wedding which is a very important
[1:09:02] occasion
[1:09:03] and people don't just wear anything to a
[1:09:05] wedding
[1:09:08] people you know there are people who
[1:09:10] don't like to dress up
[1:09:12] really don't like to dress up
[1:09:17] and those people even those people will
[1:09:19] usually dress up for a wedding
[1:09:24] especially if you're the bride of the
[1:09:26] group
[1:09:29] most of the time not always i've seen
[1:09:31] some camouflage weddings and
[1:09:34] and some odd things but usually
[1:09:37] a man may only wear a tuxedo once in his
[1:09:39] life
[1:09:41] that'll be to his wedding a woman may
[1:09:44] only wear a long dress with a train once
[1:09:47] in her life
[1:09:50] what's it for for the wedding so paul
[1:09:52] says you're coming to this
[1:09:53] this one time event this place
[1:09:57] where you're going to be christ is going
[1:10:00] to present you to himself as a glorious
[1:10:02] church
[1:10:04] not having spot or wrinkle not having
[1:10:06] any blemish in the garments
[1:10:09] you've been washed with the washing of
[1:10:11] the water by the word
[1:10:13] so that there's oh my and brother madam
[1:10:15] puts it and you can go and listen to
[1:10:17] uh invisible union he talks about how
[1:10:19] the filth of these denominations
[1:10:21] has been washed away
[1:10:24] that's right that he might present it to
[1:10:26] himself a glorious church that should be
[1:10:28] holy without blemish now listen
[1:10:29] he will not fail
[1:10:33] amen he'll have his bride ready
[1:10:39] he will not fail in presenting to
[1:10:42] himself
[1:10:43] a glorious church if he had left it up
[1:10:46] to a man
[1:10:48] oh boy i hope you're listening to me
[1:10:51] this morning if he had left it up to a
[1:10:53] man
[1:10:53] he might have failed amen
[1:10:57] if you left it up to your pastor he
[1:10:59] might have failed
[1:11:00] if he left it up to another man he might
[1:11:02] have failed but he didn't leave it up to
[1:11:04] a man he said he might present it to
[1:11:06] himself
[1:11:08] so the word came down
[1:11:12] are you with me now the word came down
[1:11:14] the word came down and even
[1:11:16] showed himself manifested in a man and a
[1:11:18] prophet but he came down in our day
[1:11:21] the word came down the son of man came
[1:11:24] down on our day why
[1:11:25] because he had to get her ready himself
[1:11:29] can't leave that up to somebody else
[1:11:33] he did the laundry
[1:11:37] for the wedding
[1:11:40] hey man
[1:11:44] he did the laundry my wife wouldn't have
[1:11:47] wanted me to pick out her clothes for
[1:11:48] the wedding
[1:11:50] but jesus did the laundry
[1:11:54] washed the garments made them made them
[1:11:56] right and
[1:11:57] brought them up through justification
[1:11:59] and sanctification and the baptism of
[1:12:00] the holy ghost the restoration against
[1:12:02] all these things
[1:12:03] to come to this hour where he could
[1:12:05] dress his bride
[1:12:09] he will not fail and we know that
[1:12:12] because revelation 19
[1:12:13] 7 says let us be glad and rejoice and
[1:12:16] give honor to him
[1:12:18] for the marriage of the lamb has come
[1:12:20] and his wife hath made herself
[1:12:22] ready to her was granted
[1:12:26] i'm so glad the her was grounded he did
[1:12:29] the laundry and he brought it by he said
[1:12:31] here it is
[1:12:33] put it on but she still has to put it on
[1:12:38] but it was granted to her that she
[1:12:40] should be arrayed in the final inning
[1:12:42] clean and white for the final inning
[1:12:45] it's the righteousness of saints
[1:12:48] how many of you i've watched my
[1:12:49] daughters over the years
[1:12:53] and whenever there's something new in
[1:12:55] the closet they have to wear it
[1:12:58] right they have to wear it it can't just
[1:13:00] be put aside
[1:13:02] for future use they'll sneak in there
[1:13:05] they'll find it they'll wear it and if
[1:13:06] there's any princess costumes or
[1:13:08] anything that
[1:13:09] that's beautiful my daughters will wear
[1:13:11] it whether it fits or not
[1:13:14] especially my youngest you know she'll
[1:13:16] go find the prettiest thing and
[1:13:17] put it on just to wear it even if it's
[1:13:20] just just to try it on she wants to wear
[1:13:22] it
[1:13:24] oh my hair it's like the bride's sitting
[1:13:27] before the wedding and she's
[1:13:28] waiting and here here's the here's the
[1:13:31] wedding garment and
[1:13:34] and it's right there in the room and all
[1:13:36] you have is rags
[1:13:39] all you have is is dirty filthy rags
[1:13:42] he said why there it is is there no
[1:13:46] interest in putting it on
[1:13:50] is there no interest in picking it up
[1:13:53] and just letting it become a part of
[1:13:54] your life
[1:13:57] if not you just walk away from the
[1:13:59] wedding
[1:14:01] well it's not for me evidently not
[1:14:05] but there's something about the bride
[1:14:09] there's something about the bride it
[1:14:11] should be there
[1:14:12] and see i have to wear it
[1:14:16] i want to put it on i want to see what i
[1:14:19] look like
[1:14:19] in it and so paul tells us to put on as
[1:14:24] the elect of god
[1:14:26] all these these fruits of the spirit put
[1:14:28] on these things why because they're here
[1:14:30] for us today
[1:14:32] here we're in the room and they're here
[1:14:33] for us he said put it on that's what god
[1:14:35] is doing today
[1:14:37] what's he doing letting you put on your
[1:14:40] clothes
[1:14:42] and the truth is that we should have our
[1:14:43] clothes on
[1:14:46] because this is our knot of the marriage
[1:14:49] supper is in the future but not the
[1:14:50] wedding
[1:14:52] we'll read that in just a moment but
[1:14:54] most of you are familiar with that now
[1:14:57] he said she takes it exactly as it's
[1:14:59] offered
[1:15:01] now to he said the fine line is the
[1:15:02] righteousness of saints that's the
[1:15:04] manifestation of the word
[1:15:05] that proves what she is
[1:15:09] you know you may not know anything you
[1:15:11] may go to a wedding not
[1:15:12] not have ever seen the bride but you
[1:15:14] know who she is
[1:15:17] right because of what she wears and who
[1:15:20] she's close to
[1:15:24] you know who the bride is because of
[1:15:26] what she wears and who she's close to
[1:15:29] now she takes the pure word of god that
[1:15:32] came to her
[1:15:33] by the prophet of malachi 4 because that
[1:15:35] was what was his
[1:15:36] job brother said he had no certain
[1:15:38] mystery it was to tie up the loose sins
[1:15:41] so it become in its fullness in this
[1:15:44] hour
[1:15:45] so that he tied up all the loose sins
[1:15:46] that were left hanging from other ages
[1:15:49] all the things that we needed to know
[1:15:52] right and so he brings that message you
[1:15:56] realize that if he hasn't finished his
[1:15:57] message you can't get dressed yet
[1:16:02] you can't even be doing what god is
[1:16:03] doing today if he has not finished its
[1:16:05] message
[1:16:07] right because how could you be dressed
[1:16:09] how could you be married to him united
[1:16:10] with him and
[1:16:11] and him it not be complete you wouldn't
[1:16:14] wear something like that so
[1:16:17] thank you for for hanging with me this
[1:16:19] morning i i don't mean to but i'm taking
[1:16:21] this slowly for a reason now
[1:16:23] and so she takes it as it's offered like
[1:16:26] esther
[1:16:27] in the bible and dresses herself
[1:16:31] esther 2 and 13. let's look at that it
[1:16:34] says then thus came every maiden unto
[1:16:35] the king whatsoever she desired was
[1:16:37] given her
[1:16:38] look whatever she desired brother
[1:16:40] branham tells us by
[1:16:42] your desire you can tell what's on the
[1:16:43] throne room of your heart
[1:16:45] somebody has no desire to go to church
[1:16:47] in the house of god there's something
[1:16:49] wrong in the throne room
[1:16:52] somebody has no desire to fellowship
[1:16:54] with god's people there's something
[1:16:55] wrong
[1:16:57] why because that's how you can tell and
[1:16:59] so every maiden come to the king and
[1:17:01] whatever she desired was given her
[1:17:03] to go with her out of the house of the
[1:17:04] women and to the king's house
[1:17:06] in the evening she went and on the
[1:17:09] morrow she returned into the second
[1:17:10] house of the women to the custody of
[1:17:12] shaskas the king's chamberlain i don't
[1:17:15] know how that's pronounced
[1:17:16] but most of us don't so which kept the
[1:17:18] concubine she came in unto the king
[1:17:20] no more except the king delighted in her
[1:17:22] and that she were called
[1:17:24] by name now when the turn of esther
[1:17:27] the daughter of abigail the uncle of
[1:17:29] mordecai who had taken her for his
[1:17:32] daughter
[1:17:33] when her turn amen what is this this is
[1:17:36] her turn
[1:17:37] that's a good way to understand the
[1:17:39] bride's bright age because it's not
[1:17:40] another age
[1:17:41] but it's her turn right and when the
[1:17:44] turn of esther
[1:17:46] the daughter of abigail's uncle mordecai
[1:17:47] who had taken her for his daughter
[1:17:49] was come to go in unto the king she
[1:17:51] required
[1:17:53] nothing but what the hey guy the king's
[1:17:56] chamberlain
[1:17:58] the keeper of the women appointed
[1:18:01] amen and esther obtained favor in the
[1:18:04] sight of all them that looked upon her
[1:18:06] now hey guy was a eunuch
[1:18:09] he had only the king's best interest at
[1:18:11] heart
[1:18:12] he wasn't in competition with the king
[1:18:15] very bad
[1:18:16] so he told her now this is what the king
[1:18:18] likes
[1:18:19] this is what he likes amen oh i think
[1:18:21] god has shown us in this hour
[1:18:23] what pleases the king amen
[1:18:27] and she had a right to wear whatever she
[1:18:29] wanted to
[1:18:31] she had a right to take in whatever she
[1:18:32] wanted to and their mother
[1:18:34] women did them other women come in with
[1:18:37] a trinitarian baptism
[1:18:40] they come in with a with a three gods
[1:18:43] they come in with a
[1:18:44] with a false uh revelation of the
[1:18:46] godhead they come in with false
[1:18:48] doctrines of all kinds they come in with
[1:18:51] man over man bishops
[1:18:54] they come in with that stuff but we
[1:18:56] can't come in with that stuff
[1:18:58] right they come in with extra biblical
[1:19:00] doctrines
[1:19:04] but she would only accept
[1:19:07] what he gave her
[1:19:11] so she was taken to the king amen
[1:19:14] when in the seventh year of his reign
[1:19:18] well if you can't see again it's just a
[1:19:21] type but you understand
[1:19:24] she was taken to the king in the seventh
[1:19:26] year of his reign
[1:19:27] now and the king it says love dexter
[1:19:31] above all the women
[1:19:33] and she obtained grace and favor oh i'm
[1:19:35] so glad
[1:19:37] was that song greatly blessed highly
[1:19:39] favored
[1:19:40] very bad i mean that's us
[1:19:44] why because we only wore we only put on
[1:19:46] what he gave us to put on
[1:19:49] amen hallelujah we didn't add anything
[1:19:52] to it we didn't take anything away from
[1:19:53] it
[1:19:54] and so the king loved esther above all
[1:19:56] the women and she obtained grace and
[1:19:57] favor in his sight
[1:19:58] more than all the virgins so that he set
[1:20:00] the royal crown upon her head and made
[1:20:02] her queen
[1:20:03] instead of asking he meant her queen you
[1:20:05] see this is the time of the marriage you
[1:20:07] say what is god doing today
[1:20:09] he's uniting us with the word
[1:20:12] and proving his word brother branham
[1:20:14] talks about he said not no more as a
[1:20:15] church see no no more the bride is
[1:20:17] called and that's brother branham and he
[1:20:19] uses those terms interchangeably just as
[1:20:20] we do but
[1:20:21] and just as paul did but here he's
[1:20:24] making a difference because there is a
[1:20:26] nominal church
[1:20:27] and there is a bride not no more the
[1:20:30] bride is called see in that day the son
[1:20:31] of man
[1:20:32] will be revealed what to join the church
[1:20:34] and here's he uses it interchangeably
[1:20:36] here but it's the true church
[1:20:38] to join the church to the head unite the
[1:20:41] marriage of the bride
[1:20:42] the bridegroom call listen we'll come
[1:20:45] right through this
[1:20:46] when the son of man will come down and
[1:20:49] come in human flesh to unite the two
[1:20:51] together
[1:20:53] now he said the church again speaking of
[1:20:57] the true church
[1:20:58] has to be the word he is the word
[1:21:02] and the two unites together and to do
[1:21:05] that it'll take the manifestation of the
[1:21:06] revealing of the son of man
[1:21:09] so we had to see god real
[1:21:14] in our day and when we saw that
[1:21:18] it attracted our attention to the son of
[1:21:19] man
[1:21:21] right now watch he said not a clergyman
[1:21:25] he said do you see what i mean he said
[1:21:27] it's son of man
[1:21:29] jesus christ will come down in human
[1:21:31] flesh among us
[1:21:34] and we'll make his word so real
[1:21:37] that it'll unite the church and him
[1:21:41] that's one
[1:21:44] the bride he said and then she'll go
[1:21:47] home
[1:21:48] to the wedding supper he said she's
[1:21:50] already united see we go to the wedding
[1:21:52] supper not to the marriage
[1:21:53] he said fill your flesh all the flesh of
[1:21:55] the mighty men because the marriage of
[1:21:56] the lamb has come
[1:21:57] but the rapture is going to the wedding
[1:21:59] supper
[1:22:00] he said when the word here unites with
[1:22:02] the person
[1:22:03] and they too become one he said then
[1:22:06] what does it do then
[1:22:08] it manifests the son of man again
[1:22:12] amen hallelujah
[1:22:16] he said i know the son of man was
[1:22:17] revealed in my day but he said when the
[1:22:19] word
[1:22:20] and the church becomes one whatever the
[1:22:23] son
[1:22:24] of man done he was the word the church
[1:22:27] does the same thing hallelujah
[1:22:31] hallelujah it manifests the son of man
[1:22:33] again
[1:22:34] and we know brother branham was not the
[1:22:36] son of man but
[1:22:38] the flesh is not the son of man the son
[1:22:40] of man is the word
[1:22:42] right he was a son of man revealing the
[1:22:44] son of man brother brown says that the
[1:22:45] angel was not the son of man that's
[1:22:47] pretty clear
[1:22:48] he was the messenger from the son of man
[1:22:51] the son of man is christ
[1:22:53] he is the one that you're feeding on he
[1:22:55] said you're not feeding on a man
[1:22:57] a man his words will fail but you're
[1:22:59] feeding on the unfailing body word of
[1:23:01] the son of man
[1:23:02] but god revealed himself through a
[1:23:04] prophet
[1:23:06] he did he revealed himself through flesh
[1:23:09] he revealed himself through flesh to
[1:23:11] reveal himself through flesh
[1:23:14] now i hope you're with me because many
[1:23:16] people don't follow it all the way
[1:23:18] through
[1:23:19] he revealed himself through flesh and i
[1:23:23] watch people and sometimes preachers are
[1:23:24] scared to preach about what brother
[1:23:26] branham said about those things and
[1:23:28] why would we be scared of that he did
[1:23:30] that
[1:23:31] to do this right
[1:23:35] he revealed himself in the flesh to
[1:23:37] reveal himself in flesh
[1:23:39] because he's also not only is he
[1:23:41] dressing
[1:23:43] his bride in the word but he is
[1:23:45] continuing his work of redemption and i
[1:23:48] want us to get that today
[1:23:49] because he's doing that in and through
[1:23:53] the bride now people say well redemption
[1:23:57] is over well
[1:23:58] brother branham said when he preached
[1:24:00] that sermon we said could it be
[1:24:02] he talked about how that it could be the
[1:24:04] last call it could be just preaching to
[1:24:05] the eternal lost
[1:24:07] and souls that are imprisoned now
[1:24:09] brother brown said if it is
[1:24:11] my kids can't be saved
[1:24:15] i'm so glad that it wasn't
[1:24:18] right because i wouldn't have been able
[1:24:20] to be saved
[1:24:22] but there is something something that
[1:24:24] happened right something happened but
[1:24:27] there's still redemption going on and i
[1:24:30] hope you follow me through this this
[1:24:31] morning but
[1:24:32] it manifests the son of man again
[1:24:34] there's got to be something that takes
[1:24:35] place
[1:24:36] for that to happen amen so he is
[1:24:39] continuing his work of redemption into
[1:24:41] the bride
[1:24:42] see after esther was made queen she had
[1:24:45] something to do
[1:24:47] that's right she wasn't done
[1:24:50] she was involved then i hope you hear me
[1:24:54] this morning
[1:24:54] she was then involved in a work of
[1:24:56] redemption
[1:24:59] amen amen
[1:25:03] why do we keep going don't give up on
[1:25:05] anybody
[1:25:07] no you have to deal with sin but don't
[1:25:08] give up on anybody
[1:25:10] because god works redemption through
[1:25:12] your life
[1:25:16] there should be nobody that we're afraid
[1:25:18] of in the sense of oh i'm afraid that
[1:25:21] if i go around him i'll just become like
[1:25:22] them no you you have to but but make
[1:25:24] sure you do things according to the word
[1:25:27] follow the word right there's certain
[1:25:30] things that we have to do as a church
[1:25:32] but there's nobody that we meet that we
[1:25:35] can't affect their life
[1:25:37] we have to believe that way
[1:25:41] now there may be eternal loss there
[1:25:43] who've rejected the message
[1:25:45] but look if that person is eternally
[1:25:47] lost he won't know it
[1:25:52] the person who's crossed the line
[1:25:54] doesn't know
[1:25:56] that he's crossed on i really believe
[1:25:57] that and brother branham said make
[1:25:59] several statements to that effect the
[1:26:00] person that's crossed the line
[1:26:02] would just not care in fact they may
[1:26:04] believe that they're a christian
[1:26:06] they absolutely believe it but they've
[1:26:08] crossed the line
[1:26:09] but a person who hasn't crossed the line
[1:26:11] feels conviction
[1:26:13] and so you take that and when we're
[1:26:15] dealing with people we deal with
[1:26:17] everybody because they're people
[1:26:20] right and i've said that recently but
[1:26:22] everybody is worth a conversation
[1:26:27] right everybody is
[1:26:31] and i'm not the best at conversating
[1:26:35] but the truth is everybody's worth a
[1:26:36] conversation
[1:26:39] everybody's worth a smile
[1:26:42] you say well that person might go to
[1:26:43] hell they might but that's a human being
[1:26:49] everybody's worth a smile everybody's
[1:26:52] worth
[1:26:52] setting an example too because you don't
[1:26:55] know who is and who isn't
[1:26:58] and the work of redemption is done in
[1:27:00] this hour through you esther had a work
[1:27:01] to do
[1:27:02] esther 14 mordecai is talking to esther
[1:27:05] he said foreign
[1:27:06] thou altogether listen if you hold your
[1:27:09] peace
[1:27:10] esther 4 14 if you hold your peace at
[1:27:12] this time
[1:27:14] then there shall enlargement of
[1:27:15] deliverance arise to the jews from
[1:27:16] another place
[1:27:17] but thou and thy father's house shall be
[1:27:19] destroyed and who knoweth
[1:27:21] whether thou art come to the kingdom for
[1:27:23] such a time as this
[1:27:26] you see the bride has the work to do
[1:27:28] after the coming of the mighty angel
[1:27:29] with an open book in revelation 10 john
[1:27:32] is told to prophesy again
[1:27:34] revelation 10 and 10 i took the little
[1:27:35] book out of the angel's hand i ate it up
[1:27:37] and it was in my mouth sweetest honey as
[1:27:39] soon as i had eaten it my belly was
[1:27:40] bitter
[1:27:41] and he said unto me thou must prophesy
[1:27:43] again before many peoples and nations
[1:27:45] and tongues
[1:27:46] and kings now watch and i'll go through
[1:27:49] this
[1:27:49] and and and we'll close in not too long
[1:27:51] but i just want us to get it this
[1:27:53] morning
[1:27:53] because the word will do something in
[1:27:55] our lives that's eternal
[1:27:57] what i say doesn't mean a whole lot but
[1:27:58] the word what the word says
[1:28:00] will mean a lot and if i speak the word
[1:28:03] then you can accept it as the word if
[1:28:05] it's not the word throw it away
[1:28:07] right i'll give you permission to do
[1:28:08] that i feel comfortable doing that
[1:28:10] because brother branham did that
[1:28:13] he said if you find a pit he said to
[1:28:14] throw the pit away don't throw away the
[1:28:15] whole pie
[1:28:17] right so now brother branham says this
[1:28:20] in the church age book he said from a
[1:28:21] little group of the true seed of the
[1:28:22] word
[1:28:23] god will present christ with a beloved
[1:28:25] bride
[1:28:27] she is a virgin of his word she is a
[1:28:29] virgin because she knows no man made
[1:28:31] creeds or dogmas
[1:28:32] no man made creeps
[1:28:36] whether it's convenient or not say well
[1:28:38] it would be convenient for me to believe
[1:28:40] this
[1:28:41] it looks like i could help the church if
[1:28:43] i taught this but
[1:28:45] is it something that he taught right is
[1:28:48] it something that you've been given
[1:28:50] to dress yourself with how can we
[1:28:53] present
[1:28:54] the church garments other than that
[1:28:55] which we've been given in this hour to
[1:28:57] be dressed with
[1:28:59] right now she's a virgin because she
[1:29:01] knows no man made creature dogmas by and
[1:29:03] through now listen
[1:29:04] by and through the members of the bride
[1:29:08] will be fulfilled say what is god doing
[1:29:11] today
[1:29:13] the work of redemption
[1:29:17] amen he might reveal something to you
[1:29:19] where you don't even realize it you get
[1:29:20] somebody on your heart you begin to pray
[1:29:22] for that person you begin to work and
[1:29:24] pray maybe that's all you do is pray but
[1:29:26] maybe you reach out maybe you talk to
[1:29:28] them maybe you deal with them in a
[1:29:29] certain way
[1:29:29] you're not realizing god is working
[1:29:31] redemption through you
[1:29:34] that's right buying through the members
[1:29:36] of the bride will be fulfilled all that
[1:29:37] was promised of god
[1:29:38] to be made manifest in the virgin he
[1:29:41] said the word of promise came to the
[1:29:42] virgin mary but that word of promise was
[1:29:44] he himself
[1:29:46] to be made manifest amen
[1:29:49] that word of promise he said well i know
[1:29:51] he did that brother branham he did
[1:29:52] but he's doing that in us today because
[1:29:55] the word of promise was he himself to be
[1:29:57] made manifest
[1:29:58] god was made manifest he himself acted
[1:30:00] at that time
[1:30:01] and fulfilled his own word of promise in
[1:30:04] the virgin
[1:30:05] it was an angel that had brought her the
[1:30:06] message but the angel's message was the
[1:30:09] word of god
[1:30:10] isaiah 9 6.
[1:30:14] amen i heard an amen from joel in there
[1:30:17] must be good
[1:30:23] now look he said speaking of mayor he
[1:30:24] said he fulfilled at that time all that
[1:30:26] was written of him
[1:30:27] because listen she accepted his word to
[1:30:30] her
[1:30:31] what did she say be it unto me
[1:30:34] be it unto me according to thy word
[1:30:36] could we do that today
[1:30:38] he said well i'm looking for something
[1:30:39] great to happen be unto me according to
[1:30:42] thy word
[1:30:43] whatever your word says that's what i
[1:30:45] want in my life if your word
[1:30:46] calls for these signs shall follow them
[1:30:48] that believe that's what i want in my
[1:30:49] life
[1:30:50] if your word calls me to prayer if your
[1:30:52] word calls me to study if your word
[1:30:54] caused me to reach out to those around
[1:30:55] me
[1:30:55] that's what i want in my life
[1:30:58] she accepted his word to her the members
[1:31:00] of the virgin bride will love him
[1:31:04] and they will have his potentials
[1:31:08] amen for he is their head and all power
[1:31:11] belongs to him
[1:31:13] and they are subject to him as the
[1:31:15] members of our bodies
[1:31:16] are subject to our heads
[1:31:21] that's why i'm walking right now my
[1:31:23] body's subject to my head
[1:31:25] sometimes i trip because it's not all
[1:31:26] together subject
[1:31:31] right if you've ever had a stroke
[1:31:32] brother jt and then were watching this
[1:31:33] morning if they ever
[1:31:35] if you had a stroke or something like
[1:31:36] that and maybe some of the rest of you
[1:31:37] have dealt with things like that
[1:31:38] physically in your body
[1:31:40] your mind will tell you tell it what to
[1:31:41] do but the body just don't obey
[1:31:44] the body just don't work like it's
[1:31:45] supposed to
[1:31:47] but this body amen
[1:31:50] this body works like it's supposed to he
[1:31:53] said notice the harmony of the father
[1:31:54] and the son
[1:31:55] jesus never did anything until it was
[1:31:57] first showed him by the father
[1:31:59] amen he says john 5 19 this harmony is
[1:32:02] now to exist between the groom and his
[1:32:04] bride
[1:32:05] he shows her his word of life she
[1:32:07] receives it she never doubts it
[1:32:09] therefore nothing can harm her not even
[1:32:11] death
[1:32:13] for if the seed be planted the water
[1:32:14] will raise it up again
[1:32:16] here is the secret of this the word is
[1:32:19] in the bride as it was in mary
[1:32:22] he said the bride has the mind of christ
[1:32:24] for she knows what he wants done
[1:32:27] with the word she performs the command
[1:32:30] of the word
[1:32:32] in his name for she has thus saith the
[1:32:35] lord
[1:32:36] then the word is quickened by the spirit
[1:32:39] and it comes to pass
[1:32:40] like a seed that is planted and watered
[1:32:42] it comes to full harvest
[1:32:44] serving its purpose
[1:32:48] those in the bride do only his will no
[1:32:51] one can make them do otherwise
[1:32:53] they have thus saith the lord or they
[1:32:54] keep still they know that it has to be
[1:32:57] god in them doing the works
[1:32:59] fulfilling his own word he did not
[1:33:01] complete all his work well in his
[1:33:03] earthly ministry so now he works
[1:33:04] in and through the bride
[1:33:09] this is what a prophet dressed us in
[1:33:12] right this is the hour we have to be
[1:33:14] dressed you've got to be dressed before
[1:33:15] you're united
[1:33:17] and if you're dressed in united then
[1:33:18] what is he doing
[1:33:21] what's he doing with you now you're
[1:33:23] dressed you're united with him
[1:33:25] with the word what are you doing you're
[1:33:27] doing what he would do
[1:33:30] amen you're fulfilling his own word
[1:33:33] he is fulfilling his own word in you he
[1:33:35] said he did not
[1:33:37] complete all his work while in his
[1:33:38] earthly ministry he works
[1:33:40] so now he works in and through the bride
[1:33:42] she knows that for it was not yet time
[1:33:44] for him to do certain things that he
[1:33:46] must do now
[1:33:47] but he will now fulfill through the
[1:33:49] bride
[1:33:50] that work which he left for this
[1:33:52] specific
[1:33:54] time amen
[1:33:58] what is that work it's his final work of
[1:34:01] redemption
[1:34:03] now watch redemption again is not over
[1:34:06] but it has changed something changed at
[1:34:09] the opening of the seals
[1:34:10] remember when christ came and hung on a
[1:34:12] cross the veil of the temple was rent
[1:34:14] many of you you know where i'm going
[1:34:15] this morning
[1:34:17] but when he hung on a cross the veil of
[1:34:19] the temple was rent
[1:34:20] and it showed that there was no mercy
[1:34:22] left in that place
[1:34:25] because the mercy seat come from the
[1:34:27] cross
[1:34:29] or come from come from the out of where
[1:34:32] it was the shekinah everything left
[1:34:34] there was just an altar there
[1:34:36] it left that place and the mercy seat
[1:34:37] was now hanging in plain view
[1:34:40] the mercy seat was christ
[1:34:43] right how many know that the mercy seat
[1:34:45] was christ
[1:34:47] right and brother branham tells us i
[1:34:48] didn't get the quote today but brother
[1:34:49] branham tells us that
[1:34:50] the mercy seat now is in the heart of
[1:34:53] his people
[1:34:56] so what he tells us go back to
[1:34:58] revelation chapter five number one i
[1:35:00] think it is he says
[1:35:01] the mercies in the heart of the people
[1:35:04] so what happened then he was hanging on
[1:35:07] a cross
[1:35:08] he leaves the cross the spirit that was
[1:35:10] in him there
[1:35:12] leaves and he and he goes on the day of
[1:35:15] pentecost
[1:35:16] and divides himself among the 120
[1:35:19] and what happens they become the mercy
[1:35:22] seat
[1:35:24] that's right and so when when peter
[1:35:27] walked out and he said this is that
[1:35:32] that was god's mercy god's place of
[1:35:35] mercy
[1:35:37] right that's how you could obtain mercy
[1:35:39] you couldn't get it by following the law
[1:35:40] anymore
[1:35:43] you couldn't get it that way anymore
[1:35:45] there's no mercy
[1:35:46] left in that place amen
[1:35:50] now you find that when jesus was some
[1:35:52] mercy see he he cried
[1:35:55] when he was on on that cross he cried
[1:35:56] father forgive them
[1:35:59] they don't know what they're doing and
[1:36:01] one day a young man named steven is
[1:36:03] being stoned
[1:36:05] and paul is standing by listening
[1:36:07] watching
[1:36:08] holding the coats for the people who are
[1:36:10] doing it
[1:36:11] concurring with it going along with it
[1:36:14] they're stoning stephen
[1:36:16] and stephen cries out
[1:36:19] lord lay not this sin to their charge
[1:36:24] why the mercy seat moved from the cross
[1:36:27] amen amen
[1:36:31] why didn't paul cross the line
[1:36:35] amen when he stoned it was was right
[1:36:38] there with him stoning stephen why
[1:36:39] didn't he cross the line
[1:36:41] there was mercy
[1:36:45] where did it come from stephen said
[1:36:48] don't lay this thing to their charge
[1:36:51] so paul could later say i did it
[1:36:53] ignorantly
[1:36:54] very bad so he become the mercy seat
[1:36:58] what had happened when paul come down on
[1:37:00] that day
[1:37:01] i'm closing in just a moment what
[1:37:03] happened when paul
[1:37:04] when when he receives something from god
[1:37:07] and he sees the pillar of fire and gets
[1:37:08] knocked off his horse he is sent
[1:37:10] to ananias right
[1:37:13] why is he sent to ananias he needed
[1:37:16] mercy
[1:37:19] he said god could have given it to him
[1:37:20] just right there he could have
[1:37:22] but this was god's way of doing things
[1:37:25] through people god's always used man
[1:37:28] now brother branham says the unveiling
[1:37:30] of god and that's why i got excited the
[1:37:32] other day and brother joel posted a
[1:37:33] quote
[1:37:34] from the unveiling of god and i kind of
[1:37:35] got excited because i had been pondering
[1:37:37] these things and
[1:37:38] the unveiling of god was a highly
[1:37:40] misunderstood message in fact brother
[1:37:42] branham
[1:37:42] at first didn't want to let it out but
[1:37:45] it was highly misunderstood
[1:37:47] but one of the greatest sermons brother
[1:37:48] random ever preached
[1:37:51] because if we can see it for what it is
[1:37:55] he's not just talking about himself
[1:37:58] he's talking about us right
[1:38:02] now look he says oh church if this tape
[1:38:04] goes out he said can't you see ministers
[1:38:06] of the gospel where you're living
[1:38:08] can't you see the hour that we're in
[1:38:10] god's showing himself setting aside
[1:38:13] amen god's showing himself aren't you
[1:38:14] glad he did in this hour
[1:38:16] aren't you glad he still does see if you
[1:38:19] can't see that he's showing himself now
[1:38:21] you end up with de facto atheist say
[1:38:23] yeah i see
[1:38:24] that he come and revealed himself as the
[1:38:25] son of man but what is he doing today
[1:38:29] huh look he said showing himself look he
[1:38:32] took that temple veil and tore it to
[1:38:34] pieces
[1:38:34] that they might see god in plain view
[1:38:36] and they was too blind to see it
[1:38:38] listen and he's done the same thing
[1:38:40] today
[1:38:41] putting his word right out in front what
[1:38:43] he promised every promise in the word
[1:38:45] laying right before us
[1:38:47] in plain view very bad
[1:38:51] amen denominations that veiled it off
[1:38:53] that mercy that was available there
[1:38:55] on the day of pentecost denominations
[1:38:57] veiled it with creeds and dogmas but in
[1:38:59] this day
[1:39:00] the veils have been ran again and the
[1:39:03] mercy seat lay in front of us
[1:39:06] when he died brother brown says the god
[1:39:08] of heaven came down
[1:39:10] like he did on mount sinai with holy
[1:39:11] fire burnt that temple veil from top to
[1:39:14] bottom tore it apart
[1:39:15] what could they do look right there out
[1:39:17] of the temple window on calvary
[1:39:19] there was god in plain view the
[1:39:21] sacrifice but they don't see it yet
[1:39:23] today
[1:39:24] god in this last day has rent those
[1:39:26] traditions away and brought the word for
[1:39:28] this age right plain and view
[1:39:31] and they still don't know it they just
[1:39:33] don't know it
[1:39:34] it's so simple see it's just so simple
[1:39:36] it's so far away
[1:39:38] from the things of the world see god
[1:39:39] identified himself with his prophet in
[1:39:41] such a way
[1:39:42] that he not only spoke the word but he
[1:39:45] even manifested the word as
[1:39:47] a as with the fullness of the word
[1:39:49] present and i hope you're staying with
[1:39:51] me that's what we can be
[1:39:53] not with the gift that he had but with
[1:39:55] the same authority with the same
[1:39:56] with the same god that's living today
[1:40:01] amen now what does the mercy seat do
[1:40:04] what happens at the mercy seat god
[1:40:06] speaks
[1:40:09] all right number 789 when moses was
[1:40:11] going into the tabernacle of the
[1:40:12] congregation to speak with him
[1:40:14] then he heard the voice of one speaking
[1:40:15] unto him from off the mercy
[1:40:17] it was upon the ark of testimony from
[1:40:19] between the two cherubims and he spake
[1:40:21] unto him
[1:40:22] you'll find that in that the mercy seat
[1:40:24] is called the oracle
[1:40:26] or the speaking place the speaking place
[1:40:30] amen amen don't you see why
[1:40:34] satan is trying to quieten the bride
[1:40:36] today don't you see why all this stuff
[1:40:38] has come try to
[1:40:39] try to stop church try to stop ministers
[1:40:41] but the brahms
[1:40:42] talked about it how that they would try
[1:40:44] to stop that mark of the beast would
[1:40:45] come and try to
[1:40:46] make it where the bride they couldn't
[1:40:47] give comfort
[1:40:49] right he talked about how they would
[1:40:51] stop preachers from giving comfort
[1:40:52] he talked about how that that there
[1:40:54] would be this mark of the beast so try
[1:40:56] to shut churches down
[1:40:57] and we know that we know that those
[1:40:59] things are in the future because brother
[1:41:00] branham says before they shut us up
[1:41:02] we'll go up
[1:41:04] right but look at it coming why is it
[1:41:07] coming in this hour because this is the
[1:41:08] speaking place
[1:41:10] not this pulpit this isn't the mercy
[1:41:12] seat
[1:41:13] this is the mercy seat you are the mercy
[1:41:18] right then what is the mercy see the
[1:41:20] speaking place
[1:41:23] right it's a speaking place moses went
[1:41:25] to the mercy seat and heard god speak
[1:41:28] hey ben what did esther do esther spoke
[1:41:32] said if you keep quiet during this time
[1:41:35] what will happen to god's people
[1:41:37] amen she spoke mercy to mordecai
[1:41:40] judgment to haman the rejecter
[1:41:43] brother branham and you so familiar with
[1:41:44] this quote musicians go ahead and come
[1:41:46] or i'm not going to quit
[1:41:48] but you're so familiar with this quote
[1:41:50] brother brown said yes sir the church is
[1:41:51] no longer
[1:41:52] the mouthpiece of god it is its own
[1:41:55] mouthpiece
[1:41:56] so god is turning on her why
[1:42:00] she doesn't speak from the mercy seat
[1:42:03] amen in this hour when they rejected
[1:42:06] christ and he hung there in plain view
[1:42:08] they rejected the word of this hour what
[1:42:10] happened the mercy seat
[1:42:11] come in hearts are you with me now
[1:42:16] amen he said so god is turning on her
[1:42:19] he will confound her through the prophet
[1:42:22] and the bride
[1:42:23] for the voice of god will be in her
[1:42:27] it's a speaking place how's god going to
[1:42:30] speak through the bride
[1:42:32] has to we can't say anything different
[1:42:33] from what the messenger said
[1:42:35] because that's the only thing she has to
[1:42:37] speak
[1:42:38] right but the voice of god will be in
[1:42:41] her yes
[1:42:42] it is for it says in the last chapter of
[1:42:43] revelation verse 17 the spirit and the
[1:42:45] bride
[1:42:45] say come amen once more the world
[1:42:49] will hear direct from god listen as at
[1:42:52] pentecost
[1:42:54] hallelujah you say brother ben these
[1:42:58] things you talk about these things and
[1:42:59] you don't understand what i'm going
[1:43:00] through right now
[1:43:01] but if you could just lift up above that
[1:43:04] for a moment
[1:43:07] if you could just look past the problems
[1:43:08] for just a few minutes
[1:43:10] if you're watching today and maybe you
[1:43:11] know i wish i could be at church there's
[1:43:12] just so many problems
[1:43:14] look just lift yourself up above that
[1:43:16] for a moment
[1:43:17] you're the speaking place
[1:43:20] you're the mercy seat of god it's in
[1:43:23] your heart
[1:43:24] you may have had failures and faults and
[1:43:26] everything else but you're the bride
[1:43:28] you've been washed for the bleeding word
[1:43:31] now you stand perfect unadulterated as
[1:43:33] if you've never done it in the first
[1:43:34] place
[1:43:35] you are the speaking place
[1:43:39] hallelujah oh then why are we speaking
[1:43:42] less than we've ever spoke
[1:43:45] in prayer we ought to be speaking with
[1:43:47] more confidence than we've ever spoken
[1:43:49] in church we ought to speak with more
[1:43:50] authority
[1:43:51] than we've ever speak spoken with before
[1:43:55] to our families we ought to speak peace
[1:43:58] to our homes we have to speak peace and
[1:44:00] safety and god
[1:44:01] moving among our among the people
[1:44:04] what is the antichrist system speaking
[1:44:06] there he's preaching peace and safety
[1:44:09] but it's a trick it's a lie but you are
[1:44:11] sheltered under his wings
[1:44:14] that's right you can speak that brother
[1:44:17] brown showed us that
[1:44:18] in his own life and through the word
[1:44:21] once more the world will hear direct
[1:44:23] from god as that pentecost
[1:44:25] but of course that word bride will be
[1:44:26] repudiated
[1:44:28] as in the first stage don't expect
[1:44:30] people to agree with you
[1:44:33] i remember let's go ahead and play
[1:44:36] something softly
[1:44:37] i remember
[1:44:41] when i first began to recognize some
[1:44:44] things about this message that were true
[1:44:47] i just being naive i guess i thought
[1:44:51] everybody would once they've learned it
[1:44:53] from me
[1:44:54] right once i told it to them they were
[1:44:57] going to get it
[1:44:58] i figured out brother ronnie it's just
[1:45:00] not that way
[1:45:02] not everybody's meant to receive it
[1:45:03] [Music]
[1:45:07] but listen they took an amalekite man
[1:45:10] one day and there was a bones of elisha
[1:45:13] i preached about it no longer ago
[1:45:15] it was the bones of elisha laying there
[1:45:17] in a grave
[1:45:20] and they threw a dead body onto those
[1:45:22] bones
[1:45:23] and this man got up
[1:45:25] [Music]
[1:45:26] it's the quickening power of god amen
[1:45:31] you know if you do that through those
[1:45:32] bones just being in proximity
[1:45:35] and i thought about this thursday as i
[1:45:36] was with my friend i thought if i could
[1:45:38] just
[1:45:38] get these bones into a place where they
[1:45:41] could be in proximity with someone who
[1:45:43] needed
[1:45:44] mercy amen if that person is ordained to
[1:45:47] life
[1:45:48] they will come to life
[1:45:51] amen amen if there's ever been an hour
[1:45:54] we should speak it's this hour
[1:45:56] if there's ever been an hour we should
[1:45:58] call out to god it's this hour we should
[1:46:00] not stop we should not
[1:46:01] let up we should not let the devil call
[1:46:04] us into submission
[1:46:05] he said well there's so much going on
[1:46:07] yes but this is the hour
[1:46:08] when the pride becomes a speaking place
[1:46:12] the place where god speaks what is god
[1:46:15] doing today
[1:46:16] speaking to the bride you speak with
[1:46:17] your life every sunday you speak where
[1:46:19] you're at
[1:46:21] whether you go to church or not it's
[1:46:23] true
[1:46:25] not just on sunday though on monday and
[1:46:26] tuesday wednesday
[1:46:29] thursday and friday and saturday you
[1:46:30] speak with your life
[1:46:32] your speaking place
[1:46:37] don't let the devil lie to you and say
[1:46:38] there's nothing going on speak
[1:46:42] be an instrument of mercy say god help
[1:46:45] me to do that is that your desire today
[1:46:47] let's just bow our heads and talk to him
[1:46:49] for a moment

[1:46:54] i believe this is your masterpiece pride
[1:46:56] i had nothing to do with it but lord
[1:46:59] your bride not just in this place but
