here amen if we could we'll just turn in the scriptures tonight just want to speak on on a thought of U of filtered First Corinthians 6 and9 amen happy to see my mom and dad it's been a few weeks since I've seen them they've been out in Arizona and uh just happy to see see them just have to see each and every one of you here tonight 1 Corinthians 6 and9 I just love this scripture 1 Corinthians 6 and9 did I get that right no that's 911 6 and9 know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God be not deceived neither fornicators nor aduls nor adulterers nor effeminate nor abusers of themselves with mankind nor thieves nor Covetous nor drunkards nor reelers nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God I love this here it says and such were some of you but ye are washed but ye are Sanctified but you are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit of our God Amen you could be seated here this evening amen may the Lord just bless his word we just want to speak on the subject of filtered and and pure and holy and stabilized and I was going to try to get to another part of it and I just don't think we can get there but um just pray the Lord would help us here tonight we look at that word filtered is to remove unwanted elements to be filtered is to be subjected to that that process and that process produces something or someone that can be desired for for use amen amen do you want to be filtered tonight do you want to be someone that that God can use and that's someone that that God desires amen amen and a a filtered Christian amen is is Justified is we're Justified we're Sanctified we're filled with the Holy Ghost and a filtered Christian is justified by faith and and what God has already done amen and your faith reaches out to that and that's the process of of being filtered and the process of of the Holy Ghost and that work in in your life and so it's already done and mean and it's part of that process he's already saved you but you've got to recognize the price that that has been paid amen and so part of the process I mean we're Sanctified by the blood of Jesus we're Sanctified Amen brother said it's a bleeding word the word bled for you and we we'll try to get to that later on Amen we're Sanctified by the blood amen and we're cleaned up that that word Sanctified is it's a dual meaning it's cleaned up and set aside for service and so we look here uh then we're we're born again we're baptized into the body of Christ by the spirit of God Amen that that's that's being filled with the Holy Ghost being born again uh the god coming down and and accepting your faith amen and and being filtered in such a way that God comes down and gives you the Holy Ghost Lord Ephesians 2 you who were dead in sin and trespasses we walked according the Bible says to the course of this world fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the mind and we're by Nature the children of Wrath but Ephesians 2:4 says but God rich in Mercy who is rich in Mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead even when we were dead in sin and trespasses had he quickened us together with Christ amen by grace are you saved amen God come down in his grace come down in his Mercy amen there's no no worse condition in being dead amen but the Holy Ghost amen the process amen come down and raised you up Quicken you to life thank you Lord my voice is going to go I don't know if we can turn me up or or help me out here a little bit yes sir and God says and or brother R says here rather in the God who is Rich and and mercy he made a provision for those who wants to be redeemed he made a provision for those who wants to be healed amen who wants to be healed tonight amen who wants to be fully redeemed here tonight amen and then because he did this it makes him rich in Mercy and he's always been rich in Mercy it must be and if you refuse this there's nothing left but the Judgment because sin must be judged amen we can't go go meet God in in our own dirty uh dirty lives we've got to be filtered we've got to be filtered by the spirit of God and by the word of God come on and so uh filtered here you know you can think about uh you can find water just about anywhere you can find water in in a Muddy Pond and am me there's ditches full of water but but that water is undrinkable and if you drink enough of that water that water will make you sick it maybe that water looks good it looks clear it looks it looks like it would be uh uh refreshing but there are germs and there are parasites and all kinds of filthiness potentially in that water depending on where you're at but if you can filter that water if you can filter that water that substance amen and any old filter won't do an oil filter won't work a filter to filter oil uh and air filter won't work but it's takes the right kind of filter amen a filter designed Amen to remove amen the filth and the grime amen a filter Amen to remove sin and unbelief amen it takes a genuine water filter to produce cure Pure Clean Water that's drinkable Amen in water we got to have water right water is life sustaining you can go without food you can go without certain things but we must have water we have to have water because life water is life sustaining right that's good you cannot live without water one time the warrior David the rejected King had been ousted from his country his own people had rejected him but David had some men even though he was rejected of his of his Country David had some men David had some mighty Gentile Warriors

anointed king amen we've got an anointed word in this hour amen it's been filtered amen it's not amen it's not a denominational word amen of man's ideas amen amen but it's an anointed word it's a pure word that we can have confidence in in this hour amen what David said they believed amen and they had real Gentile Faith to believe every promise of Deliverance through God's anointed warrior king amen the Bible says that David was a man after God's Own Heart and his Warriors recognized that the blessing of God was with him and they fought for David amen I I'll fight for somebody like that I'll

drinking some old stagnant water come on he said Palestine had a lot of bad water but Bethlehem was known for its good water oh thank you Lord you see the well that Bethlehem was a predestinated well amen filtered and pure by God's design filtered and pure by God's design amen and so David amen David amen with this well upon his heart amen he remembered taking his sheep to that will and oh oh the sweet how sweet that water was and how it quenched his thirst thank you Lord and I like this brother R said oh he thought in his mind he thought in his mind if I only had a drink from that well so David sitting here he's dwelling upon his thoughts he's dwelling upon this well he's dwelling upon that clean pure water that God had there in that land amen so he's sitting there he's dwelling upon these thoughts brother R said he remembered the days of his childhood and his memories and the victories that he had he remembered these things and now he's in a battle brother R said he's in a battle there and he's between fires there's Philistines are all around that's right and me a prophet would look into that and he said there he's in between fires he's not just sitting around he was in a battle he' been in a battle amen he was rejected amen he was out out there all alone amen and there was fires all around and he was cersi look here there between the fires he had thought it but now he screams it out oh if I could have a drink from the will at Bethlehem oh my it was more than just a thought but now amen he had spoke it forth amen he wanted he desired a drink from that well Amen brother R said they couldn't interpret his thoughts but the least of his desire was their command amen amen we can't read God's mind but God sent us his mind in this hour he sent us amen the back part of his mind amen that we could understand that we could see his desire of what his desire was for you and I of what his desire was for a bride in this hour amen and amen and his least desire is our Command in this hour Amen Let us be real servants amen for Jesus Christ they couldn't interpret his thoughts but when he spoke it amen amen they took it to heart and they took off and they drew their swords amen and the Bible says they cut through Philistines they cut through amen I believe it was 15 miles of philistine Warriors to get their King a drink oh my look at the faith amen they they stood with the word they stood with their King amen that's good amen must have been some good water must have been some good water some refreshing water that water he was he was drinking must have been pretty bad he must have been pretty thirsty right come he says here in why little Bethlehem look at these men they pulled their swords what was it he desired his desire was a drink of cool water and David what a type of our David Christ we know he's called a Holy Roller he's cast off to one side a fanatic and everything rejected by the churches we know that but we know know that the this word ever remains true and it's got to be fulfilled amen and he says in the desire of Christ is for men Warriors to stand amen that's his desire in 2025 if that was his desire Amen in the 60s when this

stimul ation of Revelation it's going to bring the faith amen when they hear the word in that final age amen it will bring the simulation for Revelation amen amen we don't just want to be worked up we

yourself I I'm going to win come on the word said I'm going to win yes sir amen we're going to go on a Rapture amen whatever the future holds this bride will rise up amen she will listen to what the spirit and the messenger say and brother Bram said in the church age book again I I just love this he said under her messenger she will be the final voice to the final age amen you will have the final save Amen in the darkness and the insanity of Hell poured out upon Le see this church not some church down the road but this church amen amen this church here tonight amen is going to win amen amen you will stand in the midst of Hell in the midst of insanity in the midst of Darkness amen as The Virtuous pure word bride I believe that with all of my heart we have returned back to the power and authority under Malachi 4 I want to read something here just to kind of stabilize your faith in this hour because it seems people are tossed so much and we can all be you know tossed with things that come along but we're we're meant to be steady we're meant to be stable and not moved about with every wind that would blow he says here in the L in church AG Exposition Church ages he says who then will have the power of infallibility which is to be restored in this last age for this last age is going to be to go back to manifesting the pure word BR that means we will have the word once again as it was perfectly given and perfectly understood in the days of Paul I tell you who will have it it will be a prophet as thoroughly Vindicated or even more thoroughly Vindicated than than any prophet in all the ages from Enoch to this day because this man will of necessity have the Capstone prophetic Ministry and God will show him forth he won't need to speak for himself but God will speak for him by the voice of the son amen amen we have come under that under that voice amen not just under a sign of something to stir the hearts of the people but we have come under the voice of that sign of that that Capstone prophetic Ministry amen where infallibility was restored where when something was said it was so when something was said it would be amen and it brought back forth amen amen amen an infallibility and you say well was brother brenham's word every word God no that couldn't be because he was a man just like you and I but he was a redeemed man that God could use amen amen and we needed the infallibility Amen to bring a pure word we needed that infallibility not to make a man God but we need that infallibility Amen to take away the error that had come through the church ages amen that we could that we could have in this last day a group that would rise up amen and be that pure word bride that's why the infallibility came not to glorify the man amen but to produce a bride for Jesus Christ let that stabilize you oh yes come on let that let that stabilize you yes sir that's good that God would so vindicate a Ministry not for that man but for you on he done it for you I and that Ministry would not point to themselves but point us to the scripture right that's right point us to the Lamb of God said I can't open the seals I can't do these things but it would take the Lamb of God to come and so that's the ministry that God gave to you and I amen amen that that to point us to the Lamb of God they could loose the seals amen they could break the seals amen and they could reveal the Mysteries amen amen point us to the Lamb of God Amen this is John the Baptist that would take away the sin from our hearts oh thank you Lord to a Ministry that would not build his own kingdom but his purpose was to see restored a true spiritual relationship amen between God and man amen aren't you thankful for that Ministry it wasn't for himself it was for you amen come on one to an age come on one Ministry like that to an age go on here just something to stabilize you questions and answers he says 1 Corinthians 13 says this he says when that which is perfect is is come that which is in part shall be done away so all these little things of jumping up down like a kid and trying to talk in tongues all these other things when that which is perfect and he says we do have today by God's help come on not me not not not my Ministry but by God's help the perfect interpretation of the word with Divine Vindication amen it was brought to you and I amen that our faith could be settled that we could have the right kind of faith that we could see who we were in the word I said this is abro it's not this over here but it's this right here amen right he said then when that which is in part is done away with when I was a child I spake as a child understood child but when I become a man I put away childish things we don't go back to that amen there's things that brought us along the way we needed those things we needed those Ministries amen amen we'll always need Ministries to help us amen that's right but it's to bring us to someone it's to point us to someone that that that can fight my battles because I can't go with you and fight your battles you can't go with me and fight my battles but if we've got one that goes with us amen amen that's that's what was brought to us amen Ephesians 5:22 I'll try to hurry here I really wanted to start out with this scripture right here come on oh Jesus help me it says here it says here wives submit yourselves under your own husband Lord forgive me I'm sorry I'm sorry Lord Jesus help me bless why submit yourselves and your own husbands as unto the Lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body therefore as the church is subject unto Christ so let the wives be to their own husbands and everything husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify it and cleanse it with the washing of the Water by the word that he might present it to himself he's going to present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish amen that's the that's that's the production that's the presentation that he's going to make amen and it comes by way of a Vindicated word that God sent in this hour amen God will have himself a glorious church amen so the husband amen is the head of the wife do we agree with that he is the head of the home and true headship and Leadership brings a stability to the wife to the family to to the ones under him amen and as the wife is is to the husband we are subject to Christ in everything amen we're sub we're we're subject to him in everything I say tonight who is committed to him tonight who is subject to him in everything amen amen our wives weren't meant to be doormats and under our feet amen and this church wasn't meant to be a doormat and just something for Christ the word amen amen but he wants to Wed you he wants to bring you to himself amen he wants to present you amen and do something in your life thank you Lord we've got to be committed to him amen he is the head he's the head and the savior of the body amen he's the savior of the body amen he saved me he delivered me amen he redeemed me from what I was Amen to what I'm going to be amen I believe tonight amen we are under his Dominion in this hour in 2025 we are under this Dominion amen we can cast all of our cares upon Him amen for he carth for you and I amen amen we are his responsibility he has taken the respons responsibility the care of you and I this bride amen upon himself come on we can cast everything upon Him amen so Christ loved the church and he gave himself for it brother ROM says here invisible Union of the bride of Christ he said and you are wearing the wedding band of predestinated unmar Grace a wedding band I say these things to stabilize you to settle you amen a a a wedding band of Grace and merited of your own God did it himself he knew you before the foundation of the world Amen so he slipped the wedding band on you there put your name on that book amen amen Satan thought he had you amen but she was already spoken for him amen he thought he can come and swoop in amen and try to mess us up and try to defile Our Lives amen but by predestination we was already spoken for amen we're we're not to be given over to another amen but that unmerited amen band of predestination that he slipped on you and I amen that put our names on the book amen amen before Satan could ever get a hold of Our Lives yes sir Amy man we're already spoken for I thought that was good I thought I'd get a stand in Ovation for that God rich in Mercy fornew you amen a god rich in Mercy amen he's seen you young people he's seen you he knows you by name amen amen he knows your name he knows where you're at amen amen he knows you he knew you before the foundation of the world amen amen and he has come in this hour he has descended with the shout the headship has came the headship has come the headship is here amen when we seen that cloud amen amen that was a top amen showing that the headship was coming to the Earth Amen to re receive its body amen and he he descended amen he descended with a shout and with the voice of the Archangel amen and as he descends amen we will be raptured up out of here amen amen he has come down to you and I he has amen identified himself with you and I Lord help us the headship coming down to unite with his subjects with his purchased possession his body come on Amen therefore brother B said the body can't recognize any other headship than the word The Head and the body are connected everything else is dead but the headship is of the one who has showed himself to us come on the prophet's message he said was to declare to you that he is here and so he would say we are life of his life amen he is our righteousness amen amen no man is Holy no mountain is Holy no church is Holy but the holy God that dwells upon the mountain amen that brings the Holiness the holy God God that lives in the heart of man that that's what brings the Holiness amen when he comes down Christ The Mystery of God revealed but I'm I'm talking about the headship of Christ notice being personally identified by the original headship the original word by we have the answer to the devil's question he said amen glory we have the answer to the devil's question he Christ is risen he has paid the price and raising up the head or raising up the body he himself has done this he himself will present himself a glorious church amen amen I say tonight he is here amen that he might sanctify me that he might sanctify you that he might wash Us by the water of the word by the filter of the word of the Gospel to present himself a glorious Church and so this bride because she's connected with the head stay with me here I'll try to hurry up this bride is not manhandled she is the Pillar of Truth there is no false Doctrine in her because she must be without spot she must be without wrinkle there's no false Doctrine her she has been made accepted in the Beloved amen she's not a dead church amen but aive unto him who gave himself for her thank you Lord and that his coming

believes every word stands as though you never sinned at the first place you're perfect the blood of Jesus Christ pure un adulterated he said leaving soon for the sky standing ready he you he said your garments Washed by the Water of the bleeding word the the word become blood the word bled for you and you are washed in the bleeding word the word bleeding amen we're clean in this hour been washed by that word by the washing of the Water by the word that the headship has brought thank you yes sir amen you love the Lord tonight I say these things try to help stabilize us we be filtered amen that we could be pure that we could be clean that we could be holy amen because we can't do these things on our own but it takes his grace in us it's his mercy and his grace amen 1 John 3:1 I'll try to finish up here 1 John 3:1 behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not beloved now are we the sons of God and it doth not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall here we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is and I like this here he said and every man that ha this hope purified himself even as he is pure so we've been given the pure word but we must purify ourselves you say well I was cleaned up a long time ago God save me sanctify me fill me amen but it's a it's a continual cleansing amen it's a continual dressing by the word amen we can't just sit around in idleness amen because things will come and go our feet get dirty and we're about to have communion amen and that's the type of you know of of walking in this life and your feet getting dirty amen so we we come together to wash feet amen amen to be cleansed by the word by the watering of the word oh yeah so we must purify ourselves even as he is pure but what a love that came down to you and I amen he he loved us when we were nothing amen and we love him the Bible says because he

Faith amen amen that we could see where we came from amen and and and and and be what we are now amen you love the Lord tonight amen let's just stand tonight Bible says that came to his own and his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor born of the flesh or the will of man but of God so what the world doesn't recognize called out to you and I amen they're going to remain in the filthiness let him that is filthy be filthy still but God has brought us something amen that we could be clean that we could be holy and be presentable to him amen let's just bow our hearts before him Place something softly amen if you just like to raise your hand up to him just
