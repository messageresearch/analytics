[44:17] this morning from Dyersburg your dad God
[44:19] bless you good to see you all this
[44:20] morning Genesis 2:21 I'm going to get
[44:22] right to it now I'm going to quit
[44:23] talking and try to get right on into
[44:25] this Genesis 221 and the Lord God caused
[44:28] a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he
[44:30] slept and he took one of his ribs and
[44:32] closed up the flesh instead
[44:34] thereof and the rib which the Lord God
[44:37] had taken from man made he a woman and
[44:40] brought forth and brought her unto the
[44:43] brought her unto the man and Adam said
[44:45] this is now bone of my bones and Flesh
[44:48] of My Flesh and she shall be called
[44:50] woman because she was taken out of
[44:54] man and let's go over to Joel chapter 2
[44:57] and verse 28 Joel 2:28 very familiar to
[45:00] most of us here Joel 2 and verse
[45:04] 28 and it shall come to pass afterward
[45:07] that I will pour out my spirit upon All
[45:09] Flesh and your sons and your daughters
[45:11] shall prophesy your old men shall dream
[45:13] dreams and your young men shall see
[45:15] visions and also upon thy servants and
[45:18] upon the handmaids in those days will I
[45:21] pour out my spirit and just one more
[45:23] before you're seated 2 Corinthians
[45:25] chapter 3 2 Corinthians chapter
[45:30] 3 and verse two 2 Corinthians 3 and
[45:35] 2 ye are our epistle written on our
[45:38] hearts known and read of all men for as
[45:41] much as you are manifestly declared to
[45:43] be the Epistle of Christ ministered by
[45:45] US Written not with ink but with the
[45:48] spirit of the Living God not in tables
[45:50] of stone but in fleshly tables of the
[45:54] heart and such as and such Trust we
[45:57] through Christ to God word not that we
[45:59] are sufficient of ourselves to think
[46:01] anything is of ourselves but our
[46:03] sufficiency is of God can you say Amen
[46:06] to that who also hath made us able
[46:08] Ministers of the New Testament not of
[46:10] the letter but of the spirit for the
[46:12] letter kth but the spirit giveth life
[46:15] and you may be seated may the Lord add
[46:16] His blessings to the word this
[46:18] morning and if we could just title this
[46:21] this morning i' would like to take what
[46:22] we spoke on two weeks ago on the
[46:23] Awakening of the Bride i' like to take a
[46:25] part two a living body and I believe
[46:28] that's what we have here on the Earth
[46:29] today a living body of Christ and if
[46:32] you'll actually go back there to where
[46:35] God would take Eve he would actually
[46:37] start off in the Garden of Eden and he
[46:38] would he would make he would make a man
[46:40] and then he would make a he would make
[46:42] all he made all the animals and he made
[46:43] a he would take a I think brother
[46:45] Wendell mentioned this he would take a
[46:46] giraffe out of the out of the dirt a
[46:48] male giraffe out of the dirt and then
[46:49] he' take a female giraffe out of the
[46:50] dirt and he would take a a male monkey
[46:52] out of the dirt and a female monkey out
[46:54] of the dirt but when he made woman when
[46:56] he made the bride to his first Adam he
[46:59] took her directly out of the side of
[47:01] Adam himself and that's because she
[47:03] would be bone of his bone flesh of his
[47:05] flesh she would be part of him and so
[47:08] just to lay a background this morning I
[47:09] would say uh just what brother Brandon
[47:12] would say here in the in the rising of
[47:13] the sun he said but now for instance
[47:15] what if we were going back to Tucson
[47:17] this afternoon not this afternoon buddy
[47:19] you still got to preach but if we were
[47:20] going back to Tucson and he talks about
[47:22] the big Cadillac you would have and and
[47:24] maybe it would be this the finest that'd
[47:26] be this car would be just he said you
[47:29] know you would have the floorboards were
[47:30] plush and the steering wheel was nickel
[47:32] plated and I've read this one before and
[47:34] and uh I always thought this was a
[47:35] pretty cool car that brother brandham
[47:37] describes and uh but he actually talks
[47:39] about this car and how great it would be
[47:41] but he said if there's he said he said
[47:43] you could have everything in it he said
[47:44] that's running running the power of the
[47:45] gasoline it's the octane he said now
[47:48] when you're going to start them you can
[47:49] have two of these identical cars they
[47:50] could look the same they could be built
[47:52] the same the same manufacturer and maybe
[47:54] they would just be some of the finest
[47:56] automobiles on the road Road and you put
[47:57] them right there side by side but if one
[47:59] of them has got gas in it it'll start up
[48:01] and go down the road but the other one
[48:02] without the gasoline in it won't move
[48:05] why because it's not the it's not the
[48:07] mechanics of the car it's actually
[48:09] something to make the car go down the
[48:10] road it's something to make the car move
[48:13] can you say Amen so it's not good enough
[48:15] just to be a Christian and sit in church
[48:16] and say well I I've got all I need just
[48:18] go here I hear the message of the hour
[48:20] that's wonderful but really what we need
[48:22] is the spirit of God in us to make the
[48:24] word live in us again can you say Amen
[48:27] and so we go on down here brother
[48:28] Brandon would say he said one of them
[48:29] don't have any spark any firing power
[48:31] well you say the power is in the
[48:33] gasoline he said I don't care how much
[48:34] power is in the gasoline unless there's
[48:35] a spark there to manifest that power
[48:38] unless there's power there to confirm
[48:40] that that's the gasoline it's just might
[48:42] as well be water so you could you could
[48:44] have everything you could have
[48:45] everything right you could dress right
[48:47] look right act right go to church three
[48:49] times a week everything you want to do
[48:51] could be just perfect and I believe in
[48:52] all these things but none of that is
[48:54] going to move you towards a rapture none
[48:56] of that is going to raise you up in the
[48:58] time of rapture but the word being made
[49:00] manifest in you and living through you
[49:03] as a living word that that makes a
[49:05] living body can you say amen and so
[49:07] brother Brandon would go on he said no
[49:08] matter how much theologians claim how
[49:10] well you've got your church set how much
[49:12] education you've got how much like the
[49:14] Bible until the wave sheath until the
[49:16] Holy Spirit comes upon that person to
[49:18] Quicken that word the gasoline
[49:20] represents the word he said it's the
[49:21] truth but without the spirit it won't
[49:23] move can you say amen he said we put too
[49:25] much stress on the mechanics and nothing
[49:27] on the Dynamics now I would like to just
[49:29] go ahead and tell you a prophet didn't
[49:30] say there was nothing to the mechanics
[49:32] but he said you've emphasized the
[49:33] mechanics and you've completely left off
[49:35] the Dynamics that would make the word
[49:37] live so it's not good enough to go over
[49:39] here and just be a good fundamental
[49:40] Christian but you've got to have
[49:42] something on the inside of you that will
[49:44] make you move from the dead condition
[49:46] that you're in and actually raise you up
[49:48] into Heavenly things can you say Amen
[49:50] we're not just here to be another church
[49:52] we're not just here to be another bride
[49:54] he said there be brides and brides and
[49:55] churches and church but there'll come
[49:57] one bride and there'll be one church
[49:59] that's going to go in a Rapture can you
[50:01] say Amen so it's not just another church
[50:03] it's not just another bride it's not
[50:05] just another set of rules for our church
[50:06] but it's something that has come on the
[50:08] inside of us that is going to raise us
[50:10] up in the time of rapture can you say
[50:12] amen and so brother Brandon would say
[50:14] here he said it needs the dynamic power
[50:17] of God the resurrection power of Jesus
[50:19] Christ upon the church to manifest and
[50:21] to bring to pass that this is gasoline
[50:23] and when you try to put the holy spirit
[50:24] in a denomination you can get a Putter
[50:27] and you'll ruin your engine by getting
[50:28] it full of carbon but oh I'm so glad
[50:31] that there's a 10,000 octane power the
[50:33] word of God and a holy ghost to light it
[50:36] up well can you sayen it's not just the
[50:38] spirit but it's not just the word you've
[50:40] got to have the word and the spirit to
[50:43] make this thing move on down the road
[50:45] you can't stay in your condition and go
[50:47] in a Rapture but you've got to have
[50:48] something move you from your condition
[50:50] it's got to be an Awakening of the Bride
[50:52] in this time it's got to be something to
[50:53] raise us up from our from our from our
[50:55] worldly mentality and the way we are and
[50:57] the way we Act and the way we do our
[50:59] everyday lives will actually bog us down
[51:01] to such a place where you can't move but
[51:03] when the Holy Ghost comes on the inside
[51:05] it actually ignites the word that you've
[51:07] heard and it makes a living Epistle of
[51:09] you can you say Amen brother Brandon
[51:11] would say excuse me the Bible says in 1
[51:13] th 1 Thessalonians 1 and 5 for Our
[51:16] Gospel came not unto you in word only
[51:18] but also in power and in the Holy Ghost
[51:21] and in much Assurance as you know what
[51:24] manner of men we were among you for your
[51:26] sake see it's not in word only it's not
[51:28] hearing the word that saves you but it's
[51:30] the word becoming alive in you that
[51:32] saves you so you can sit and hear this
[51:34] message every service and you can sit
[51:36] and listen to this message every day in
[51:38] your home you could read that Bible
[51:39] until you've read every every chapter
[51:41] every verse of it and those are good
[51:43] things but that will not do anything
[51:45] unless the Holy Ghost comes on the
[51:46] inside of you and makes the word live
[51:49] what you've read and makes it makes the
[51:51] word on the inside of you live out and
[51:53] be an epistle can you say Amen so we're
[51:55] not just here to play church and you
[51:57] we're not here just to have a good time
[51:59] or a good social Gathering we're not
[52:01] just here to say well we've learned a
[52:03] little bit today or the instructions
[52:04] were good and we learned how to dress we
[52:06] learned how to act no did it actually
[52:08] come on the inside of you and was it
[52:10] quickened by the Holy Ghost and if it
[52:12] was not quickened by the Holy Ghost then
[52:14] it's just a dead letter and when you
[52:16] walk out of here and you go to work on
[52:17] Monday morning you'll forget what was
[52:19] said and you'll forget how you're
[52:20] supposed to act as a Christian you for
[52:22] you'll forget how you're supposed to
[52:23] talk as a Christian but what you'll do
[52:25] if you really come in contact with the
[52:27] Holy Ghost me in this message and you
[52:29] see who you are and you see the message
[52:32] that has brought you out then you'll
[52:33] know that I'm a living body and I do not
[52:36] have to bow down to the man of this
[52:38] world I do not have to bow down to the
[52:39] Creeds of denominations but I've
[52:41] actually am walking in the fullness and
[52:44] the manifestation of the message of the
[52:46] hour I'm no longer just looking for a
[52:48] bride I am the bride can you say Amen
[52:51] I'm no longer looking for somebody to
[52:52] raise up and live the message I'm going
[52:54] to live this message I'm not looking for
[52:56] for somebody just to come in the power
[52:58] but I am going to come in the power of
[53:00] this message I'm not looking for
[53:01] somebody else to do the job of being
[53:03] ready for a Rapture I'm going to be
[53:05] ready for the Rapture I'm not looking
[53:07] for somebody else to fulfill that part
[53:08] of the scripture I am going to fulfill
[53:11] that part of the scripture why because
[53:12] he's Raised Me Up by a Living Word with
[53:15] a living power and a living bride is on
[53:17] the earth now doing the same works that
[53:19] he did can you say Amen so we're not
[53:22] looking for somebody else to take our
[53:23] position my position is to be part of
[53:25] this bride I'm not looking for somebody
[53:27] else to sit where you're sitting you're
[53:28] sitting where God placed you this
[53:30] morning for a reason you're not listen
[53:32] God did not put you here just to make it
[53:34] through the tribulation but he put you
[53:36] here so that you can be called up higher
[53:38] into a Rapture can you say Amen listen I
[53:41] think we're too often we're thinking
[53:43] well we're just another church and we go
[53:44] through the motions like every other
[53:45] Church we're not just another church we
[53:47] believe that God has restored a message
[53:49] in our day we believe that God has
[53:50] called us for a higher calling we
[53:52] believe that God has called us from a
[53:54] dead condition of a denominational
[53:55] system into the newness of life into the
[53:58] gospel message of the hour can you say
[54:00] amen God has not put us here just to be
[54:02] another Christian but he's put us here
[54:04] to live out the word of God can you say
[54:06] Amen so I'll get on down here just a
[54:07] little bit and brother B said the word
[54:09] of God and the Holy Ghost to light it up
[54:10] he said and resurrect the power of God
[54:12] into a man's life or a woman's life or
[54:14] into a church he said that's what shoved
[54:16] that Cadillac down the road Yonder under
[54:18] the dynamic power of the Holy Ghost
[54:20] which came back and was waved over the
[54:22] people at the day of Pentecost making
[54:23] him the same yesterday today and for
[54:26] ever so if the Holy Ghost comes in this
[54:28] church it'll be just like an Acts 2
[54:30] Church well can you say Amen if the Holy
[54:32] Ghost comes on you you'll act just like
[54:34] they did if you if the Holy Ghost comes
[54:37] into you you'll believe the word that
[54:38] they believe if the Holy Ghost comes on
[54:40] this church you will do the same things
[54:42] that they did why because God has never
[54:45] changed his program he's never changed
[54:47] his way of doing things but he's always
[54:49] done the same thing he is still Jesus
[54:51] Christ the same yesterday today and
[54:54] forever can you say Amen so when you
[54:56] look at that and you see that it takes
[54:58] the power to make this word live listen
[55:00] I believe that the word lives I believe
[55:01] that the word we are serving is a Living
[55:03] Word but to live through you there's got
[55:05] to be something on the inside of you to
[55:07] make the word live I don't believe that
[55:09] the message we're serving is a dead
[55:10] message I don't believe that for a
[55:11] minute but if you don't have something
[55:13] on the inside of you that will really
[55:15] believe that message then it's just dead
[55:17] to you it's not dead the word itself is
[55:19] not dead but somebody has got to make
[55:21] this message live through them can you
[55:23] say amen amen and so the the message is
[55:26] not dead the word is not dead this Bible
[55:28] the words in this Bible are not dead
[55:30] words can you say Amen so how is it dead
[55:32] if it's just in the letter if you read
[55:34] it without the holy ghost in your life
[55:36] it's just a dead letter to you if you're
[55:38] listening to tape service after service
[55:40] and there's been no quickening power on
[55:41] the inside of you it's just dead letters
[55:44] to you but if you've got the Holy Ghost
[55:46] on the inside of you then it will
[55:47] actually resurrect you by the things
[55:49] that you hear it will resurrect you by
[55:51] the things that you read when you read
[55:53] that there will be a Rapture of the
[55:54] church you believe there's going to be a
[55:55] Rapture of the church when you read that
[55:57] there's a holy ghost coming just like
[55:59] the book of Acts you participate in that
[56:01] why it's the bride's Revival that is
[56:04] Awakening the bride today and you are
[56:06] coming into full manifestation as Sons
[56:08] and Daughters of God today oh I wish
[56:10] somebody'd preach with me here this
[56:11] morning you don't have to worry about
[56:13] who you are you are the bride you don't
[56:15] have to worry about what why was that
[56:17] service not more emotional don't worry
[56:18] about how emotional the service was is
[56:20] there something on the inside of you
[56:22] that made the word live on Monday
[56:24] morning is there something on the inside
[56:25] of our young people that makes them act
[56:27] different dress different is it
[56:29] something that makes you have a
[56:31] difference from the world you will not
[56:33] act like the world you won't be
[56:34] partakers of the things of this world
[56:36] why because God is moving through you
[56:38] God is living through you you can't look
[56:41] any different than what the inside of
[56:42] you looks like oh sure you might be able
[56:44] to go for a while and say well I'm just
[56:46] I'm just struggling along here I'm
[56:47] trying to look like a Christian I'm
[56:49] trying to wear the long dresses and the
[56:51] have the long hair listen it won't do
[56:52] you no good to try until you get
[56:54] something on the inside that actually
[56:56] makes you want to line up with the word
[56:58] of God it's not about putting on
[56:59] something on the outside it's something
[57:01] on the inside that shows on the outside
[57:04] can you say Amen listen the church it's
[57:06] not a it's not a list of rules you can
[57:08] come sitting this church with pants on
[57:10] you can come sitting this church in here
[57:11] a woman can sit here and not line up to
[57:13] this message at all and it wouldn't do
[57:15] her any good to try to blend in why
[57:16] because just blend it in ain't going to
[57:18] make it a Rapture but if you'll actually
[57:19] get something on the inside of you
[57:22] sister Stephanie when you came back to
[57:23] the Lord and you came down with a broken
[57:25] and a contrite heart there was something
[57:27] on the inside of you that made you let
[57:29] your hair grow out there was something
[57:31] on the inside of you that made you act
[57:33] like a Christian and start going to
[57:34] church again listen we're not here just
[57:36] for rules we're not here just for a show
[57:38] but we're here for the Holy Ghost to
[57:40] have way in our lives can you say
[57:43] Amen this is not just another church
[57:46] it's not just another time of of Revival
[57:48] but this is the final Revival this is
[57:50] the final people in a final in the final
[57:51] age can you say Amen listen you can say
[57:54] you can say where you getting all this
[57:55] brother Joel well the scriptures are
[57:56] very plain the the scriptures are very
[57:58] plain that there will be a coming of
[58:00] Christ and there will be there will be
[58:02] dead that have already went into the
[58:03] ground and they will come up with him
[58:05] can you say amen and if we are a part of
[58:07] this group whether we go by way of the
[58:08] Grave or whether we go in a Rapture
[58:09] listen either way we're going to be in a
[58:12] Rapture together caught up together to
[58:14] meet our Lord but you've got to have the
[58:16] quickening power on the inside of you or
[58:18] you'll never be raised again can you say
[58:20] Amen so it's not just another quickening
[58:23] it's not just another Power it's not
[58:24] just another Pentecostal power I say
[58:26] praise God for the Pentecostal power
[58:28] praise God for the gifts of the Spirit
[58:30] praise God for all these things but
[58:31] there's got to be something on the
[58:33] inside of the Bride that actually
[58:35] ignites you by the word and the message
[58:38] of your age it's not just another
[58:40] messenger it's not just another message
[58:43] but it is God himself coming into the
[58:45] believer and living out through you can
[58:47] you say Amen God's not looking for just
[58:50] another form and not just another form
[58:52] of a body of Christ but he's looking for
[58:54] the body of Christ who can live today
[58:56] he's looking for a living body who will
[58:58] be doing the same thing not by emotion
[59:00] but by the word and if the word is there
[59:03] and the spirit ignites the word you are
[59:05] an invincible Army can you say Amen you
[59:08] are unstoppable well somebody ought to
[59:10] say praise the Lord I am Invincible here
[59:12] this morning not this flesh is
[59:13] Invincible but the body word of God that
[59:16] is in you is Invincible nothing can shut
[59:19] you up nothing can stop you can you say
[59:21] Amen am GL so if the bride has a voice
[59:25] and we know she does then she's got to
[59:28] be feeding on something so that she can
[59:30] speak what she's heard can you say Amen
[59:33] so the bride in the first in the first
[59:36] in the Garden of Eden the first bride
[59:37] you'll see that she would fall by
[59:39] disbelieving one word can you say amen
[59:42] and now that wasn't that wasn't
[59:44] something that there was never a promise
[59:45] that she wouldn't fall but God put him
[59:47] on free moral agency and said you've got
[59:49] this entire Garden you've got everything
[59:51] here and I told you about this a couple
[59:52] weeks ago you've got everything
[59:54] everything is yours but you can't can't
[59:56] touch the one tree you can't do this one
[59:58] thing and she couldn't keep that part of
[1:00:01] the word why I would like to say it like
[1:00:03] this this is before you could be
[1:00:05] redeemed this is before a fall and in
[1:00:07] order to be redeemed you've had to
[1:00:09] fallen and be brought back can you say
[1:00:11] amen and so in this age you are actually
[1:00:14] more powerful than the first Eve was she
[1:00:17] could fall to The Cutting devis fables
[1:00:19] of Satan but you cannot fall because of
[1:00:22] something on the inside of you that is
[1:00:24] actually already overcome the devil well
[1:00:26] can you say Amen this is not something
[1:00:28] you can fall the devil cannot steal your
[1:00:31] joy the devil cannot take your health
[1:00:33] the devil cannot take you out why
[1:00:35] because he has no power over you because
[1:00:38] you are not your own but you are a part
[1:00:40] of him can you say Amen you're not just
[1:00:43] another church and that's why I say that
[1:00:45] so often you're not just another church
[1:00:47] member but you're part of a living body
[1:00:50] and you have power can you say
[1:00:52] Amen well how we get there brother Joel
[1:00:54] you're born into it
[1:00:56] you're born into this body by one Spirit
[1:00:58] we're born into this body not by
[1:01:00] somebody walking in the back door and
[1:01:01] saying do you understand the Seven Seals
[1:01:03] do you understand the Thunders do you
[1:01:05] understand all these things do you
[1:01:06] understand exactly how uh everything
[1:01:09] every un unveiled mystery do you do you
[1:01:12] understand all these things no maybe you
[1:01:13] don't understand them just yet but if
[1:01:14] there's something on the inside of you a
[1:01:16] seat of God and then the word is
[1:01:18] preached if the word falls on good seed
[1:01:21] then it will produce Life in The
[1:01:22] Believer can you say Amen so it doesn't
[1:01:25] take a work up or emotion you may sit
[1:01:27] there for years on that Pew and you may
[1:01:29] never make a move but when the spirit
[1:01:31] and the seed that life come together
[1:01:33] something will start to grow in your
[1:01:35] life something will start to manifest in
[1:01:38] your life there will be something more
[1:01:40] than just another Sunday morning service
[1:01:42] but there'll be something raised up in
[1:01:43] the person that says I believe every
[1:01:45] word of that message that's been
[1:01:47] preached I believe everything that a
[1:01:49] prophet said I may not look like it yet
[1:01:51] but I'm striving to line up with the
[1:01:53] word of God in this day that's a bride
[1:01:55] that's Rising that's a bride that's in
[1:01:57] full power that's a bride that has full
[1:01:59] strength not one that may look good but
[1:02:01] one that the word has had an effect on
[1:02:03] can you say Amen so when the word has an
[1:02:06] effect it's not just something that we
[1:02:08] make ourselves do Brother David this is
[1:02:10] election this is predestination you say
[1:02:13] well that's a dirty word it's a new
[1:02:14] testament word predestination maybe
[1:02:17] maybe foreign to denominational churches
[1:02:18] but it's a Bible word it's exactly what
[1:02:20] Paul taught and it's what our messenger
[1:02:22] came and taught us everything Paul
[1:02:24] taught he taught us and he actually took
[1:02:26] us back listen how do we know we're
[1:02:27] following a word Prophet because the
[1:02:29] word Prophet took us right back to the
[1:02:30] scriptures he didn't cut out one
[1:02:32] scripture to fit his idea he didn't cut
[1:02:34] out one scripture to fit just an agenda
[1:02:37] he didn't cut out one scripture to try
[1:02:38] to show who he was but he proved by the
[1:02:41] scripture that there was a word coming
[1:02:43] and a bride coming there was a word
[1:02:44] appearing and a bride coming of Christ
[1:02:47] and you are on the Earth today can you
[1:02:50] say Amen you say well where's the body
[1:02:52] of Jesus Christ well you are the body of
[1:02:54] Jesus Christ there there is a literal
[1:02:56] body Believers believe that there's a
[1:02:58] literal body coming back but this is
[1:03:00] this is the body for today brother BR
[1:03:02] said you are the very body you have the
[1:03:04] hands of Jesus you have you are the feet
[1:03:06] of Jesus you are the voice of Jesus can
[1:03:09] you say Amen so if the voice of the
[1:03:11] Resurrection was in the first body the
[1:03:13] voice of the Resurrection is in this
[1:03:14] body we don't have to wait for a prophet
[1:03:16] to come back and reveal the voice of the
[1:03:17] Resurrection to us but the voice of the
[1:03:19] Resurrection is in the bride can you say
[1:03:21] Amen why would we look for something
[1:03:23] else to come when the very body of Jesus
[1:03:25] Christ is sitting right here among us
[1:03:27] today well can you say Amen you say
[1:03:30] brother Joel where do you get Authority
[1:03:31] for that I'm going to tell you he said
[1:03:33] no matter how much the mechanics prove
[1:03:34] to be right there's got to be a Dynamics
[1:03:35] to make it work that's what he proved he
[1:03:38] said that's what Easter proved he wasn't
[1:03:39] only the word but he was God himself the
[1:03:42] Dynamics in the word that made the body
[1:03:44] of Jesus Christ cold stiff and dead in
[1:03:46] the grave Shake into life and rise again
[1:03:49] and roll away that stone I am he that
[1:03:50] was dead so dead Till The Sun said he
[1:03:53] was dead the moon said he was dead the
[1:03:55] Stars said he was dead all nature said
[1:03:57] he was dead and now the whole world has
[1:03:59] to recognize that he's alive again he
[1:04:02] was not only the mechanics God's word he
[1:04:04] was the Dynamics to prove it and what
[1:04:06] did he leave you he left you that same
[1:04:09] spirit and if that spirit that was in
[1:04:11] Jesus will come in you it will Quicken
[1:04:14] your mortal bodies to the word can you
[1:04:17] say
[1:04:18] Amen he's alive again he was not only
[1:04:22] the mechanics he was the Dynamics to
[1:04:24] prove it can you say amen and as he
[1:04:27] being the groom the bride has to come
[1:04:29] forth cuz it's part of him well can you
[1:04:30] say Amen now we're going to get down to
[1:04:32] the sermon part this morning if we are
[1:04:34] the second Eve we have got to come forth
[1:04:37] from the side of Adam himself if the
[1:04:39] first Eve had to come from the literal
[1:04:41] body of Adam then the second Eve has got
[1:04:43] to come by the same way we've got to
[1:04:45] come from the very life that was in
[1:04:47] Christ has got to dwell in The Believer
[1:04:49] can you say Amen so we're not here
[1:04:51] listen we're not just a a a pretend body
[1:04:54] we're not just here to say well God has
[1:04:56] raised us up just to kind of uh fill his
[1:04:58] place but no we understand there's an
[1:04:59] absence of the physical body of Jesus
[1:05:01] Christ on the Earth but in his absence
[1:05:03] you are his body and his voice that's a
[1:05:06] direct quote you are his body and his
[1:05:08] voice and so it would just say it like
[1:05:10] this if you are his body and if you are
[1:05:13] his voice and I believe you are this
[1:05:14] morning if you are you will do what he
[1:05:17] said you will say what he said and I
[1:05:20] believe that God's Prophet would come in
[1:05:22] this day and he would actually turn your
[1:05:24] hearts back not just back to Pentecost
[1:05:26] but all the way back to you could
[1:05:28] recognize the very Life of Christ that
[1:05:30] would come on the Believers at the day
[1:05:32] of Pentecost would actually start to
[1:05:33] dwell again in human beings on the earth
[1:05:36] can you say Amen so it's not just
[1:05:38] another it's not just another church
[1:05:40] that would come through another age and
[1:05:42] you would start a Revival and the
[1:05:43] Revival would die Brother David but when
[1:05:45] the Revival fire started in this church
[1:05:48] it was the Life of Christ itself stealth
[1:05:50] and this bride Revival can't die no more
[1:05:53] than he can die and if his spirit is
[1:05:55] here then you are living until the time
[1:05:58] of rapture can you say amen and then the
[1:06:00] very spirit that makes you live now will
[1:06:02] just pick up another body and go live in
[1:06:04] it well come on somebody you ought to be
[1:06:06] the happiest people on the face of the
[1:06:08] Earth this morning you can't even face
[1:06:09] death because as a Christian there's a
[1:06:12] body already waiting for you how many
[1:06:13] believes you've got a theophany then
[1:06:15] don't worry about dying on this side
[1:06:17] because you're going to step into a
[1:06:18] theophany body don't worry about what
[1:06:20] the what the world would call death
[1:06:22] because when God looks at a Christian he
[1:06:24] realizes there is Is No Death for you
[1:06:26] but you have already been caught out
[1:06:28] from the things called out from the
[1:06:29] things of deadness and and and you've
[1:06:31] been called to the newness of Life why
[1:06:33] because in you is the potentials of a
[1:06:35] Rapture in you is the potentials of a
[1:06:37] resurrection in you is the potentials of
[1:06:40] a full restoration back to just like it
[1:06:42] was in the Garden of Eden where all
[1:06:44] things are perfect before the fall when
[1:06:46] there was no death there was nothing to
[1:06:48] ever stop the cycle of Revival but I say
[1:06:51] today we're looking for the same thing
[1:06:53] to happen but I believe the potential
[1:06:55] are already in you that's why I said a
[1:06:57] couple weeks ago standing here you are
[1:06:59] the bride's Revival you are the final
[1:07:01] voice you are the living body of Jesus
[1:07:04] Christ why because everything that you
[1:07:06] have need of for a Rapture is already on
[1:07:08] the inside of you everything you have
[1:07:10] need of to make it out of this
[1:07:11] tribulation everything you need of to go
[1:07:13] on this Rapture listen you don't have to
[1:07:15] have a Prophet come and tell you about
[1:07:16] it again you've already heard the voice
[1:07:19] of God for your age the voice of God is
[1:07:21] now living in you and the voice is in
[1:07:24] the Bride Can you say amen amen so don't
[1:07:27] look for something else to come this
[1:07:30] message is everything you have need of
[1:07:32] this message is not something different
[1:07:33] than the Bible but it is the opening of
[1:07:35] the Bible to you it is the very opening
[1:07:38] of the word of God to you can you say
[1:07:39] Amen am and brother B go on like this
[1:07:42] and he
[1:07:43] said he said as a man and woman are one
[1:07:46] and the woman taken from his side she
[1:07:48] had taken a spirit the feminist Spirit
[1:07:50] from him the flesh from his side and
[1:07:52] made both
[1:07:54] mechanics and Dynamics can you say amen
[1:07:56] amen the wife and he said the spirit of
[1:08:00] him and the Flesh of him and put it
[1:08:04] together and made mechanics and Dynamics
[1:08:08] I would like to just present it like
[1:08:09] this when he made Adam he was nothing
[1:08:12] until the breath come in his body can
[1:08:14] you say amen he could make a human being
[1:08:17] and he could be laying there but he was
[1:08:19] nothing until the breath would come into
[1:08:21] his body and make him a living Soul so
[1:08:24] the very Breath of God had to breathe
[1:08:26] into Adam in order to make him alive
[1:08:28] well I hope you're hearing me here this
[1:08:29] morning and the Very Breath of God
[1:08:31] himself has got to come into the
[1:08:33] believer well can you say Amen or else
[1:08:35] you're just a dead Christian well can
[1:08:38] you say amen I believe that the body may
[1:08:39] be there but until you recognize
[1:08:41] something and you hear the voice of God
[1:08:43] for your day and you say well now
[1:08:46] something has woke me up something has
[1:08:48] raised me from just a body to a living
[1:08:50] body can you say Amen something has made
[1:08:52] me more than just a than more than just
[1:08:55] an denominational Christian but it has
[1:08:57] made me a Living member of this body
[1:08:59] that is on the earth now can you say
[1:09:00] Amen so we see that this is not just a a
[1:09:03] fairy tale but we'll see that through
[1:09:05] scripture this has always been God's
[1:09:08] program can you say Amen his first Adam
[1:09:10] he made the body and then he had to
[1:09:11] breathe life into the body can you say
[1:09:13] amen and then from that Adam he had to
[1:09:15] take a wife and he would call her Eve
[1:09:17] and and and we find out that she had to
[1:09:19] not come from the dust just like other
[1:09:21] other people would come or other other
[1:09:22] other animal life would come from but
[1:09:24] she would actually come from the very
[1:09:26] life that was in Adam and so it would
[1:09:28] just be a type for later on in life God
[1:09:31] see what what we miss about this whole
[1:09:33] thing is God put them on free moral
[1:09:34] agency because God knew there'd be a
[1:09:36] fall and God wanted them to be able to
[1:09:38] choose for themselves and yet she would
[1:09:40] choose to fall and then there had to be
[1:09:42] a Redemption to come back and the blood
[1:09:44] would have to cover these people there
[1:09:46] would have to be a son that would come
[1:09:47] and die not just another lamb that would
[1:09:49] come and die not just another goat that
[1:09:50] would come and die but there had to be
[1:09:52] an actual Son of God who was actually
[1:09:54] the life of God the flesh of God had to
[1:09:56] come and actually die himself be put to
[1:09:59] sleep for a while well can you say Amen
[1:10:01] had to be put to sleep so the bride
[1:10:03] could come forth under the same power
[1:10:05] and then he would raise us up with him
[1:10:07] oh can you say man I wish somebody hear
[1:10:09] me this morning if you'll ever look back
[1:10:11] to that first story it may look just
[1:10:13] like a story to you but if you ever see
[1:10:15] how God was showing his future events
[1:10:17] right there in the Garden of Eden then
[1:10:19] you can see that there may be an absence
[1:10:20] of the body of Christ today but in his
[1:10:22] absence while he was asleep while he
[1:10:24] wasn't there there was a living body and
[1:10:26] that living body would actually be the
[1:10:28] body and the voice of him and so then if
[1:10:30] you'll see when we're resurrected we're
[1:10:32] meet we were caught up together to meet
[1:10:33] him in the air we are joined together
[1:10:36] again with the groom can you say amen
[1:10:38] and so we believe there's a literal body
[1:10:40] we don't deny the literal body of Jesus
[1:10:42] Christ but we believe that where he is
[1:10:44] we're going to be someday where he is
[1:10:46] now that's where I'm going where he is
[1:10:49] that's where the bride longs to be at
[1:10:52] there's something on the inside of the
[1:10:53] Bride that doesn't want to stay here
[1:10:55] this is an Earthbound condition that
[1:10:57] we're in I don't care if the politics
[1:10:59] are better or worse than they were two
[1:11:00] weeks ago I'm going to tell you right
[1:11:02] now the Rapture is upon the bride the
[1:11:04] Rapture is still here the government's
[1:11:06] still as corrupt As It Ever Was well can
[1:11:08] you say man America has still turned
[1:11:10] down God there's nothing better except
[1:11:12] maybe your pocketbook I pray it is I
[1:11:14] know my needs to be but there's nothing
[1:11:16] better about this world than it was two
[1:11:18] weeks ago but I want to tell you what's
[1:11:20] different we're two weeks closer to a
[1:11:21] Rapture than we were two weeks ago and I
[1:11:24] would say even more so now look up for
[1:11:27] your Redemption draweth nigh look up
[1:11:29] because we're not just going to be
[1:11:30] solved here we're not going to be
[1:11:32] settled down here and we're not going to
[1:11:33] be happy with World politics we're not
[1:11:35] going to be happy with the way this
[1:11:36] condition is going listen you can walk
[1:11:38] out here on the streets and sin still
[1:11:40] abounds on the streets of America sin
[1:11:42] still abounds on the streets of this
[1:11:43] world there's still all kinds of
[1:11:45] indecency and things on the worldly
[1:11:47] streets but what is it there's a bride
[1:11:49] that is called out and looks different
[1:11:51] and is not looking to the world but is
[1:11:53] looking at a future home that has
[1:11:55] already been prepared for you can you
[1:11:58] say Amen so brother Brandon would say it
[1:12:00] like
[1:12:01] this he said until the church or the
[1:12:03] people all these Easter bunnies and
[1:12:05] ceremonies and big churches and finer
[1:12:07] will fail and pass away until that
[1:12:09] church becomes both Dynamics and
[1:12:10] mechanics the spirit of God that moved
[1:12:12] him to the things things he did If he if
[1:12:15] he hit on 16 cylinders so will the bride
[1:12:18] can you say amen for he said in John
[1:12:20] 14:12 he that believeth on me the works
[1:12:21] that I do shall he do also can you say
[1:12:24] Amen
[1:12:25] so listen we're not outside the Bible
[1:12:27] here this morning we're here to do the
[1:12:29] Greater
[1:12:29] [Music]
[1:12:31] Works we're here to do more of what he
[1:12:33] did why because we are his body it's not
[1:12:38] brother Joel PR that can lay hands on
[1:12:39] you and cast Devils out but the spirit
[1:12:41] of Christ if it's in me according to the
[1:12:43] word I can lay hands on the sick and the
[1:12:45] Devils have to go brother Stuart can
[1:12:47] stand up here and pray for the sick it's
[1:12:48] not brother steuart standing here
[1:12:49] praying for the sick but it's Christ in
[1:12:51] him obeying the word that he's heard and
[1:12:54] is laying hands on the sick and you
[1:12:56] shall recover there's no reason to come
[1:12:59] to the altar if you don't believe that
[1:13:00] when you walk away I don't care what the
[1:13:02] preacher said when he prayed what you
[1:13:03] need to do is say I'm going there as my
[1:13:06] as the commission of Jesus Christ he's
[1:13:08] going to lay his hands on me and I'm
[1:13:09] going to walk away walk away healed I'm
[1:13:11] going to be delivered of this demon
[1:13:13] that's on me everything I have need of
[1:13:15] is going to happen why because you went
[1:13:16] in obedience to the word of God now it's
[1:13:19] your job to believe on the word it's
[1:13:23] your job to believe that the word works
[1:13:24] it's it's not good enough to say well
[1:13:26] the preacher believes it and the PE and
[1:13:28] and and brother Stuart you know and
[1:13:30] brother Josh and these brothers and
[1:13:31] brother Ben he'll stand up here and tell
[1:13:32] us the word works the word works well if
[1:13:34] you don't recognize the word working it
[1:13:36] won't do you any good but you've got to
[1:13:38] let the word work through you and it
[1:13:40] will change you from those doubts and
[1:13:42] fears of this world but it will move you
[1:13:44] on into a place where you don't have to
[1:13:46] worry anymore you don't have to think
[1:13:48] well maybe cancer is too big for God no
[1:13:50] cancer is not too big for God Cancer's
[1:13:52] never been too big for God and I don't
[1:13:54] care what your condition is I don't care
[1:13:56] if it's diabetes I don't care I don't
[1:13:58] care what your condition is maybe it's
[1:13:59] hearing loss whatever it is this morning
[1:14:01] nothing is too hard for God if he ever
[1:14:05] healed a deaf person he'll always heal a
[1:14:07] deaf person if he ever healed one from
[1:14:09] cancer he'll always heal one from cancer
[1:14:11] if he ever saved a young person he's
[1:14:13] always going to be saving a young person
[1:14:15] if he ever brought one prodigal back
[1:14:17] he's going to continue to bring prodal
[1:14:19] back why because until the very end of
[1:14:22] this world his word will still be in
[1:14:24] action can you say Amen his word doesn't
[1:14:27] stop just because because your Revival
[1:14:29] fires died out a little bit because the
[1:14:31] Revival fires are here the Revival fires
[1:14:34] are here when you don't feel the Revival
[1:14:35] fires the Revival fires are here when
[1:14:37] you don't feel good the Revival fires
[1:14:39] are here when the church is half full or
[1:14:41] or maybe when it's hardly anybody here
[1:14:42] on a Wednesday night and you look around
[1:14:44] well where's the Revival the Revival is
[1:14:45] in the believer that is sitting there on
[1:14:47] a Wednesday night the listen we don't
[1:14:49] put everybody else out of the Bride
[1:14:50] Revival they might be in it too but
[1:14:52] listen just recognize what your Revival
[1:14:54] is it just because I show up to three
[1:14:56] services a week not recently but usually
[1:15:00] and don't that don't make me a part of
[1:15:01] the bride's Revival and you out of it no
[1:15:03] it's something on the inside of
[1:15:05] you I believe in Christians going to
[1:15:07] church I believe they'll go to church I
[1:15:09] believe all those things but that's not
[1:15:10] what decides who's bride and who's not
[1:15:13] whose bride is because God has put a
[1:15:15] seed on the inside of you and you
[1:15:16] recognize your day and its message and
[1:15:19] you have been raised up from the dead
[1:15:21] condition that you're in and now you
[1:15:23] can't help but serve God why because
[1:15:25] you've not you you're not you're not
[1:15:27] your own anymore but you belong to him
[1:15:29] can you say Amen we get on down here
[1:15:31] before I run out of time y'all still
[1:15:33] okay the mechanics without the Dynamics
[1:15:36] is no good neither is the Dynamics
[1:15:39] without the mechanics excuse me the
[1:15:40] mechanics and the Dynamics vice versa
[1:15:41] they're neither neither way you can't
[1:15:43] have one without the other you can
[1:15:45] scream and shout and jump up and down
[1:15:47] all you want to and deny this word it
[1:15:50] won't do you any good well can you say
[1:15:51] amen he said you're just cranking on the
[1:15:53] Pistons
[1:15:55] he said you got you got the spark of the
[1:15:57] fire there but no gasoline to fire it by
[1:16:00] it'll only work as they come together so
[1:16:03] you may sit there and you may be able to
[1:16:05] work yourself into a shout well can you
[1:16:07] say amen and I believe in shouting if I
[1:16:09] have to say this every time I stand up
[1:16:11] here I guess I will but I do believe in
[1:16:13] shouting and I do believe in dancing and
[1:16:15] I do believe in speaking in tongues what
[1:16:17] can you say man everything that was
[1:16:18] restored back to this church I'm a part
[1:16:20] of it but you can't take one and then do
[1:16:23] away with the other right so if you have
[1:16:25] the real Dynamic power of God in your
[1:16:27] life it will not go against the word
[1:16:32] mechanics so if your shout will line up
[1:16:35] with the word you're speaking in tongues
[1:16:36] will line up with the word well can you
[1:16:38] say man your dance is going to line up
[1:16:39] with the word all these things are good
[1:16:41] but they're going to line up with the
[1:16:42] word of God well can you say man it's
[1:16:44] not because listen the Corinthian Church
[1:16:46] had all that stuff and then Paul had to
[1:16:47] come and set it in order so it's not
[1:16:49] just that it's not just that you have it
[1:16:52] but it's having it together you've got
[1:16:53] to have the spirit that will keep that
[1:16:56] keep the mechanics alive but you've also
[1:16:57] got to have the mechanics to know when
[1:17:00] the when the Dynamics are just over
[1:17:01] there firing off and there's nothing to
[1:17:03] it well can you say Amen so you've got
[1:17:05] to have them together hope that's okay
[1:17:08] one will go up he said he said so one
[1:17:10] will set still he said only it'll only
[1:17:12] work as they come together so one will
[1:17:14] set still and the other one will go up
[1:17:15] that's the only thing that there is to
[1:17:16] it yet they both might look alike both
[1:17:18] claim to be churches he's talking about
[1:17:20] the bride he's talking about the one
[1:17:21] goes and one stays and and one will be
[1:17:23] left and the other will be taken he's
[1:17:25] talking about that scripture here and he
[1:17:26] says so one will sit still and the other
[1:17:27] one will go up that's the only thing
[1:17:29] there is to it and yet they both might
[1:17:31] look alike both claim to be churches
[1:17:34] both claim to be bride well can you say
[1:17:36] Amen but one has mechanics and Dynamics
[1:17:39] and it brings it to pass of what he said
[1:17:41] is the truth it just won't move no
[1:17:43] matter how good the mechanics is until
[1:17:45] the Dynamics come when the Dynamics come
[1:17:48] that fire is made to connect with that
[1:17:50] Octane and the gasoline and when that
[1:17:52] explodes it causes a
[1:17:56] combustion well I would like to know how
[1:17:58] you can sit still in the house of God if
[1:18:00] you've had the mechanics and the
[1:18:01] Dynamics meet together because it will
[1:18:04] cause a combustion well can you say Amen
[1:18:06] I'm I just want to stop here for a
[1:18:08] second so bad and just preach to you and
[1:18:10] I shouldn't
[1:18:13] and yall know how I feel about it you're
[1:18:16] good so when that explodes it causes the
[1:18:18] combustion I'm going to preach about it
[1:18:20] you
[1:18:22] know sometimes I look out here and you
[1:18:24] all are really good this morning morning
[1:18:25] every one of you are really wonderful y
[1:18:26] all looking at me and smiling and it's
[1:18:28] just wonderful it's nice I just want to
[1:18:30] stay here all day you know and uh and I
[1:18:33] won't but but you know I'm looking out
[1:18:35] there and I'm seeing a smiling face but
[1:18:37] sometimes and i' I've I've been the i'
[1:18:40] I've done this myself so I can preach
[1:18:41] about it sometimes you come to church
[1:18:43] and you sit there and you look you're
[1:18:44] like a mule looking at a new gate you
[1:18:45] know you're just dead as 12:00 just I
[1:18:48] mean just dead just the word couldn't
[1:18:50] move you if Jesus Christ himself walked
[1:18:52] right out and come right down there and
[1:18:54] touched you on the shoulder you I mean
[1:18:56] I'm I don't mean to be sacrilegious I'm
[1:18:58] just saying sometimes that's how bad it
[1:19:00] looks you know looks like well you just
[1:19:02] don't want to be here you know but
[1:19:03] listen the truth the truth of it is if I
[1:19:06] told you that his Spirit was literally
[1:19:09] here yes sir the actual Spirit of Christ
[1:19:12] is here and the word that he sent for
[1:19:14] the church is here if it's
[1:19:18] here then wouldn't you have the same
[1:19:20] reaction that if the L literal body
[1:19:22] himself was here the truth be told we
[1:19:24] have a lot of of people who are very
[1:19:26] similar to the people that were in
[1:19:27] Jesus's day that didn't recognize him
[1:19:30] when he came well can you say amen and
[1:19:33] so people today fail to recognize him
[1:19:36] when he comes and so I've preached on
[1:19:39] this before but I'm just going to say it
[1:19:40] again if that's okay you've got to
[1:19:42] entertain him when he's here it's not
[1:19:45] him coming to be entertained he wants to
[1:19:47] entertain you and if you are the living
[1:19:50] body then we got to act like we're
[1:19:53] alive but it's not just on the Flesh and
[1:19:56] so I want to break this down to you just
[1:19:57] a little bit your flesh may not move but
[1:20:00] something on the inside of you will so
[1:20:03] I'm not accusing somebody of sitting
[1:20:04] there quiet that's not necessarily what
[1:20:06] I'm talking about but is there something
[1:20:07] on the inside of you that has changed
[1:20:09] you from what you are this morning to
[1:20:11] what you're going to be on Monday
[1:20:11] morning well can you say Amen there's
[1:20:14] got to be something on the inside of you
[1:20:16] that actually comes alive and changes
[1:20:17] there's got to be something different
[1:20:19] can you say Amen there's got to be
[1:20:20] something that moves you not it's got to
[1:20:22] be something that moves you forward this
[1:20:24] car may not have jumped up and down it
[1:20:27] may not have you know sat there and and
[1:20:29] you know maybe maybe spun out and did
[1:20:30] donuts and stuff but what it did was it
[1:20:32] moved right on down the road and made it
[1:20:34] to its destination why because there was
[1:20:36] something on the inside of the car that
[1:20:38] would move the car so if there's
[1:20:40] something on the inside of the believer
[1:20:41] I may not see the emotion of it today I
[1:20:43] do believe there'll be something on your
[1:20:45] face that'll show you're listening but I
[1:20:46] may not see the full full effect of the
[1:20:48] word today but what I will see and what
[1:20:51] you will see as fruit inspectors of the
[1:20:53] Gospel of Jesus Christ you will see
[1:20:55] tomorrow a different person and the next
[1:20:57] day a different person and next year
[1:20:58] it'll be somebody different it won't
[1:21:00] look the same listen because something
[1:21:02] has changed you and you are different
[1:21:05] than you used to be so I'm not saying
[1:21:07] everybody's going to change overnight
[1:21:08] I'm not saying everybody's not going to
[1:21:09] fall down but I love how brother Josh
[1:21:11] benett said it you you can fall down but
[1:21:13] you cannot fall away you can fall down
[1:21:15] and make mistakes but you cannot fall
[1:21:17] away if you were ordained to be in this
[1:21:20] body you always were and you always will
[1:21:23] be nothing can take you out of this body
[1:21:26] nothing can change you why because you
[1:21:29] are nothing can change you for the worst
[1:21:31] but the only change you're going to make
[1:21:32] is better every day every day can you
[1:21:35] say Amen am we'll get on down here and
[1:21:37] see if we can finish before the lunch
[1:21:40] Burns Paul said the gospel came to us
[1:21:43] not in word
[1:21:44] only but brother brandom doesn't play on
[1:21:46] words he said through the spark also to
[1:21:49] make it move there you are it came to us
[1:21:51] in that manner it's the same spirit that
[1:21:53] raised him up that quickened the True
[1:21:55] Believer to eternal life The Same Spirit
[1:21:57] now Romans 811 if the Same Spirit of him
[1:21:59] that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell
[1:22:00] in you he said there you are if the
[1:22:02] bridegroom Spirit dwells in the bride
[1:22:04] what can you say Amen if the bridegroom
[1:22:07] Spirit dwells in you you are the bride
[1:22:09] and that actually makes the bride do
[1:22:11] what what what what Jesus himself did
[1:22:13] listen and so I believe the bride will
[1:22:15] have both the mechanics and the Dynamics
[1:22:16] do you believe it when the Believers
[1:22:18] gathered in the upper room all in one
[1:22:19] Accord and they believe the message
[1:22:21] brother R said but they were cowards
[1:22:23] they had the mechanics to go up up there
[1:22:25] but they were all sitting back in there
[1:22:26] saying oh I'm afraid of them I'm afraid
[1:22:28] to go out with all them great big
[1:22:29] Bishops and things out there oh I'm
[1:22:31] afraid them priest and things the kids
[1:22:34] at school's going to laugh at me the
[1:22:35] church down the street will laugh at me
[1:22:37] I don't really care who laughs at me
[1:22:39] because I'm not trying to match them
[1:22:41] Lord knows I'm not trying to match them
[1:22:42] I want to match what he wants for me
[1:22:44] well can you say amen God doesn't want
[1:22:46] me just to be another denominational
[1:22:48] Church listen there are good people in
[1:22:49] the denominational churches I'm not
[1:22:50] putting them out but we are not called
[1:22:52] to be a denominational Church we're
[1:22:54] called to be the pride of Jesus Christ
[1:22:56] can you say amen he said so I'm not he
[1:22:59] said oh I'm they were cowards they were
[1:23:00] afraid of the priests and things I'm
[1:23:02] afraid to make that claim I'm afraid to
[1:23:03] say I I believe on him oh I just can't
[1:23:05] do it see but all of a sudden the
[1:23:07] Dynamics come well can you say amen and
[1:23:09] what did it do it not only filled their
[1:23:11] spirit inside but it quickened their
[1:23:13] mechanics their bodies were quickened
[1:23:15] they were no more cowards I want you to
[1:23:17] know they were still in their physical
[1:23:19] bodies on Earth but there was some kind
[1:23:22] of a spirit that came in them they were
[1:23:23] not scared SC of what the other churches
[1:23:25] thought of them no more they weren't
[1:23:27] scared if somebody called them a Holy
[1:23:28] Roller or a Pentecostal listen we're not
[1:23:30] scared of what the Baptists or the
[1:23:32] methodists call you what I'm here to
[1:23:33] tell you this morning that you are not
[1:23:35] just the denomination but you are called
[1:23:38] and chosen I say wake up Sleeping Giant
[1:23:42] wipe the sleep from your eyes it's your
[1:23:44] time to raise up as the army of
[1:23:46] [Music]
[1:23:47] God you don't have to stay down there
[1:23:49] anymore it's like Samson sitting there
[1:23:50] with his eyes put out Samson may have
[1:23:52] stood there with no no power no more and
[1:23:55] he had no eyes in his head anymore but
[1:23:57] listen there came to him a thought just
[1:23:59] a thought that once more he could have
[1:24:01] this revival fire again and it came
[1:24:03] stronger than it ever had before maybe
[1:24:05] you've been falling down and you've
[1:24:07] Fallen you've fallen down and can't seem
[1:24:09] to get up from this message anymore and
[1:24:11] you seem like you just can't believe it
[1:24:12] like you used to and there's no spark
[1:24:14] like there used to be but let me go
[1:24:15] ahead and tell you just put your hands
[1:24:16] up on the pillars and say once more Lord
[1:24:19] restore unto me the joy of your of thy
[1:24:22] salvation restore unto me the power to
[1:24:24] defeat the enemy of this day wake up
[1:24:26] sleep and GI it's your time can you say
[1:24:30] Amen we're not cowards because we've met
[1:24:33] the spirit of God we don't have to be
[1:24:35] worried about the way we dress or act
[1:24:36] because we've got the spirit of God in
[1:24:38] us well can you say amen God wants us to
[1:24:41] not be cowards but he wants us to be
[1:24:42] soldiers in the army of God he wants you
[1:24:44] to be bold he wants you to be courageous
[1:24:46] with this message he doesn't want you to
[1:24:48] be afraid of the message of Malachi 4
[1:24:50] but stand up and declare that this is
[1:24:52] the restoration message and it is
[1:24:54] changing Hearts back again can you say
[1:24:58] Amen their bodies were K were quickened
[1:25:01] no more cowards they went right on out
[1:25:02] in the face of the people you men of
[1:25:04] Judea and you that dwell in
[1:25:06] Jerusalem before the Dynamics come they
[1:25:08] were just mechanics see you men that
[1:25:10] dwell in Jerusalem let this be known
[1:25:11] unto you and hearken un my words these
[1:25:13] are not drunk as you suppose I'm one of
[1:25:16] them this is that I'll show you what it
[1:25:18] is it's the scripture this is that what
[1:25:20] can you say amen he said and I've always
[1:25:23] said if this ain't that let me keep this
[1:25:25] till that comes and he said no this is
[1:25:27] it well can you say Amen we're not
[1:25:29] looking for that to come but we know
[1:25:31] that what we've got this is that that
[1:25:33] was spoken of by the Prophet this is
[1:25:36] that that was spoken of and prophesied
[1:25:37] for our day well come on church do you
[1:25:39] realize you're living out prophecy
[1:25:41] you're living out the revelation of the
[1:25:42] Mysteries contained in the book you are
[1:25:45] living out and you are written Epistles
[1:25:47] read of all men the open book has
[1:25:49] produced a bride that can see that the
[1:25:51] mechanics and the Dynamics are both here
[1:25:54] and they are going to do the Greater
[1:25:56] Works now come on somebody you know that
[1:25:58] you're she you know you're the bride now
[1:26:00] we time to rise up and act like it don't
[1:26:02] act like we're put down and defeated you
[1:26:05] can't be defeated oh you might lose your
[1:26:07] job and you might even fall apart in a
[1:26:09] marriage but God he's not going to leave
[1:26:11] you here he's going to take you to a
[1:26:13] place that's already been prepared for
[1:26:14] you it is a city that has been dwelt in
[1:26:17] by the lamb and he's the light of the
[1:26:19] world and you are going to go there and
[1:26:21] you're going to S with him listen the
[1:26:23] wedding has already taken in place
[1:26:25] you've already been married to the groom
[1:26:26] it's time to rise up and recognize your
[1:26:28] status the bride and the groom have come
[1:26:31] together and you now have the mechanics
[1:26:33] and the Dynamics can you say
[1:26:36] Amen right so it's not something we're
[1:26:38] looking for can you say Amen brother
[1:26:40] brandom said that was spoken by the
[1:26:42] prophet Joel and it'll come to pass in
[1:26:43] the last days sayith God I'll pour out
[1:26:45] my spirit upon All Flesh see the
[1:26:46] Dynamics come into the mechanics so they
[1:26:48] were there waiting under the mechanics
[1:26:51] and the Dynamics came and filled the
[1:26:53] house where they were sitting
[1:26:55] well can you say amen and so they were
[1:26:57] no longer just sitting waiting but now
[1:26:59] they were up and
[1:27:01] doing they were up acting like drunk men
[1:27:04] and if it had that effect on them
[1:27:06] couldn't it have that same effect on
[1:27:09] us and I'd say that'd be just fine
[1:27:11] wouldn't you it wouldn't hurt nobody's
[1:27:13] feelings in here if we started acting
[1:27:14] like drunk men at 3:00 in the
[1:27:16] afternoon we might we might totally miss
[1:27:18] your service buddy 3:00 we'll be walking
[1:27:21] around drunk as skunks and on new wine
[1:27:28] Hallelujah well I'd be okay with a good
[1:27:30] old Revival again wouldn't you I'd be
[1:27:33] just fine if the if the church started
[1:27:34] acting just like they did on Acts 2 when
[1:27:37] they started acting like drunk well come
[1:27:38] on somebody I know that a I know that
[1:27:40] ain't the sign that God's with you
[1:27:41] because we've got a promise that God's
[1:27:42] with you but it's okay once in a while
[1:27:45] to bask in the presence of God and let
[1:27:47] the Holy Spirit run over on the outside
[1:27:49] and let the whole world know I'm one of
[1:27:50] them Holy Rollers I'm one of them that
[1:27:53] is over this world I am the Bride of
[1:27:56] Jesus Christ can you say amen
[1:27:59] amen they wasn't afraid no more some of
[1:28:02] you people that are afraid that some
[1:28:03] woman will laugh at you for having long
[1:28:04] hair or quit wearing makeup some of you
[1:28:06] men that's afraid your organization will
[1:28:07] throw you out when you baptize your
[1:28:09] congregation in the scriptural baptism
[1:28:11] you need to close yourself in the upper
[1:28:12] room till the Dynamics come in well can
[1:28:14] you say amen he said that's right it
[1:28:16] changed them it quickened them it made
[1:28:18] them different they were a changed
[1:28:19] people from then on it quickened them
[1:28:21] from an old life of being a coward to
[1:28:23] like the the lion of the tribe of Judah
[1:28:25] they were bold as a lion when the Holy
[1:28:27] Ghost came on them why you can't talk me
[1:28:29] out of this message you can't make me go
[1:28:31] back to the denominations again you
[1:28:33] can't stop this bride from moving on in
[1:28:36] the full power you have the full
[1:28:38] strength as the bride can you say Amen
[1:28:40] they absolutely faced martyrdom and
[1:28:42] nailed across as crucified upside down
[1:28:44] they were burnt they throw lions in they
[1:28:46] were no more cowards about them death
[1:28:47] had no victory over them well can you
[1:28:49] say amen he said the Dynamics was in the
[1:28:52] mechanics yes sir it quickened mortal
[1:28:54] bodies he said now listen here's another
[1:28:56] thing for proof it so quickened them in
[1:28:58] such a way till they was lifted up in
[1:29:00] Heavenly places and their mortal bodies
[1:29:02] was so Quicken till their language
[1:29:04] changed well can you say man it actually
[1:29:06] changed the very language they couldn't
[1:29:08] even talk to each other in English no
[1:29:09] more I know that wasn't their language
[1:29:11] miss me with it I'm just
[1:29:13] saying but they couldn't even talk to
[1:29:15] each other they couldn't even speak
[1:29:17] right why because they were under an in
[1:29:20] an influence From Another World they
[1:29:23] were under the influence of God himself
[1:29:25] it wasn't the world they were taught up
[1:29:26] to speak a certain language and now they
[1:29:28] totally forgot everything they knew why
[1:29:30] because the spirit of God was living
[1:29:32] through them well can you say Amen thank
[1:29:35] I'd say it's okay if if the spirit of
[1:29:37] the Lord comes and does the same thing
[1:29:39] here this morning can you say Amen it's
[1:29:41] all right listen I I I know that the
[1:29:43] gifts have been put in order and I
[1:29:44] believe that but but I I'm okay that I
[1:29:46] do believe the gifts still exist I do
[1:29:48] believe that the word did not do away
[1:29:50] with anything why because it's a
[1:29:52] restoration of all things it's a
[1:29:54] restoration of the fullness of the word
[1:29:56] and I told you a couple weeks ago and I
[1:29:57] went that direction in this sermon here
[1:29:59] but I I know I went the direction of the
[1:30:01] the importance is on the word and it is
[1:30:03] but don't go over here and say well the
[1:30:04] word's good the word's great I'm
[1:30:06] listening to it I'm here listen you can
[1:30:08] be a hearer only but not a doer also the
[1:30:11] Book of James tells you that that
[1:30:13] there's hearers only but not doers also
[1:30:15] if you've heard the word the word has
[1:30:16] got to have an action behind it can you
[1:30:19] say Amen matter of fact brother Brandon
[1:30:20] would go on to say your faith has got to
[1:30:22] have an action behind it your faith if
[1:30:24] you just say I got faith it won't do you
[1:30:26] no good until you put that faith in
[1:30:28] action where can you say amen I have
[1:30:30] faith to believe that God Saves and God
[1:30:32] restores and live like the devil no if
[1:30:33] you have faith in it then God is going
[1:30:35] to come in there and he's going to
[1:30:37] anoint that faith and you can't stay in
[1:30:39] the condition that you were in can you
[1:30:41] say amen I want to just say this and I
[1:30:45] know a lot of times I've dealt with
[1:30:47] family being out there I've got a lot of
[1:30:48] family out in the world I've got lots of
[1:30:49] family in the world and I do believe
[1:30:53] that the mechanics have been sewed into
[1:30:54] their lives but I do believe at one
[1:30:56] point in their life some point in their
[1:30:58] life God's going to go meet them with
[1:30:59] the Dynamics and actually wake them up
[1:31:01] and see who they are thank you Lord I I
[1:31:04] may not even live to see it but I know
[1:31:05] God's going to do it if you've got
[1:31:07] family out there that you're worried
[1:31:08] about I say quit worrying about him take
[1:31:10] the limits off of God well can you say
[1:31:13] man he is not limited in his power he is
[1:31:16] not limited in his resources don't limit
[1:31:18] him with your faith in him because he
[1:31:21] has no limit can you say Amen there's
[1:31:23] there's no limit to his grace there's no
[1:31:25] limit to his Mercy there's no limit to
[1:31:28] the backsliders he can bring back
[1:31:29] there's no limit to God take the limits
[1:31:32] off and let God work can you say
[1:31:35] Amen there's no more there's no more
[1:31:38] cowards there's no more limits when
[1:31:40] you've actually come into contact with
[1:31:41] the word of God and he said here's
[1:31:44] another thing for proof it's so
[1:31:45] quickened them they were caught up in
[1:31:47] and changed their language he said it
[1:31:49] quickened their language that's what the
[1:31:51] Bible said and their mortal bodies being
[1:31:53] quickened their language was quickened
[1:31:54] their thoughts were quickened their
[1:31:55] Spirits were quickened I say we need a
[1:31:57] quickening in our Spirits this morning
[1:31:58] can you say ameny listen church I know
[1:32:01] some people call it fanaticism but I I
[1:32:03] think sometimes we need to have a little
[1:32:04] fanaticism just to get back in the house
[1:32:05] of God and enjoy church again we we
[1:32:07] don't need to make this a miserable
[1:32:08] place to come we need to let this place
[1:32:10] be filled with the power of God and and
[1:32:12] and the joy of God flowing over listen
[1:32:14] don't don't make Church miserable you
[1:32:16] make it that way when you're not
[1:32:17] expecting something in the house of God
[1:32:19] well come on somebody you you you make
[1:32:21] it Miss well it's so hard to go to

[1:32:26] fight here a few days ago and there was
[1:32:28] them two fighters I forget their names

[1:32:37] that AT&T Stadium in Dallas was just
[1:32:39] full of people why they were expecting

[1:32:46] their expectations were Skyhigh they
[1:32:48] were expecting something awesome
[1:32:49] something Dynamic something
[1:32:51] powerful and yet maybe there would be
[1:32:53] something something would leave
[1:32:54] disappointed but really the ones that

[1:33:16] excited he's he's the greatest of all
[1:33:19] time some nonsense like that everybody

[1:35:56] amen God is not looking for a people God

[1:36:22] nobody tell me that I have not overcome
[1:36:24] this world I may fight every day but the
[1:36:26] flesh May fight every day but something
[1:36:29] on the inside of me was ordained to make
[1:36:30] it all the way down to the end well can
[1:36:32] you say amen God is not going to leave
[1:36:35] me here to be burnt up with the fire and
[1:36:37] the destruction but before one drop
[1:36:40] could fall the bride has got to go home
[1:36:43] what can you say
[1:36:46] Amen when you give the car some gasoline
[1:36:50] and it meets with a spark it'll move
[1:36:53] right if it sits
[1:36:55] still then you may need to take that car
[1:36:57] to a mechanic we got Dr Jesus in the
[1:37:00] house this
[1:37:02] morning listen we're not Earthbound
[1:37:04] anymore I I've probably said it before I
[1:37:07] say a lot of things that I've said
[1:37:09] before but you know when the eagle was
[1:37:12] in the chicken pin he was always an
[1:37:13] eagle he was born an eagle he had he
[1:37:17] looked like an eagle he didn't even look
[1:37:19] like he was in the right
[1:37:20] place he was actually born to be a part
[1:37:23] of a Heavenly Body but he was in a
[1:37:26] denominational system and they were
[1:37:27] clucking around and they were trying to
[1:37:29] tell him well you can't fly over that
[1:37:31] fence because you're a chicken well they
[1:37:32] could tell him he was a chicken but he
[1:37:34] wasn't a chicken Brother David they
[1:37:36] could tell him he was he had no he had
[1:37:38] no power but inside of this Eagle there
[1:37:41] was power all the time well can you say
[1:37:43] Amen inside of this Eagle there was
[1:37:46] power in those wings that would raise
[1:37:48] him up out of a denominational system
[1:37:51] inside of this Eagle he could look over
[1:37:52] there and see them hens of scratching
[1:37:54] and he tried to do what they did and he
[1:37:56] just couldn't fit in but then one day he
[1:37:59] heard an eagle scream what can you say
[1:38:01] man he heard a prophet of Malachi 4 fly
[1:38:03] over and say come out of her my people
[1:38:06] get away from those denominational walls
[1:38:08] you're not a chicken and the little
[1:38:10] Eagle had heard other voices all its
[1:38:13] life but it heard this voice and
[1:38:15] recognized the voice and became a living
[1:38:18] Eagle that day it may have been down
[1:38:20] there and couldn't fly but he actually
[1:38:22] found the power to fly out of that
[1:38:24] chicken coop why just by hearing the
[1:38:27] word of God and the power that woke up
[1:38:29] inside of him raised him out of the
[1:38:31] situation he was in out of the bondage
[1:38:34] that he was in I say you're free this
[1:38:35] morning little bride you're more than
[1:38:37] able to take the land you've already
[1:38:39] possess the promises but don't let the
[1:38:41] Giants scare you don't let the Devils
[1:38:43] tell you that there's nothing for you
[1:38:45] everything in this message is yours can
[1:38:48] you say Amen everything is yours all of
[1:38:52] it the power the overcoming your
[1:38:55] children everything is yours everywhere
[1:38:59] the the your foot would step is yours
[1:39:02] every possession you you just go ahead
[1:39:03] and claim every one of them children
[1:39:04] this morning come on somebody claim
[1:39:06] those brothers and those sisters and
[1:39:08] everybody else go ahead and claim them
[1:39:09] this morning why because there's no
[1:39:11] reason to be beat down by a devil that
[1:39:13] said I've got your kids no that devil
[1:39:15] ain't got nobody he's just a
[1:39:18] scarecrow that's right but what he's
[1:39:20] doing is he's scaring you because he's
[1:39:21] the voice you're feeding
[1:39:24] we'll stay away from that one but he's
[1:39:25] the voice you're feeding so so you just
[1:39:27] can't you can't feed that one anymore
[1:39:29] and so you move right on and then you've
[1:39:31] got to you've got to you've got to feed
[1:39:32] on the word of God can you say Amen
[1:39:35] you've got to you've got to you got to
[1:39:36] have an appetite for Spiritual things
[1:39:38] well can you say Amen actually if you
[1:39:40] don't have an appetite for coming to the
[1:39:42] church and what you'll find out is
[1:39:43] eventually you'll you'll quit coming at
[1:39:45] all right and if you have no appetite
[1:39:47] for the word of God there's no reason to
[1:39:48] go to church because that's what takes
[1:39:50] up most of the time and and if there's
[1:39:52] and if there's no appetite for words
[1:39:53] you'll find that the the tapes you used
[1:39:55] to listen to are just Dusty and or or or
[1:39:57] the thumb drive or whatever the phone
[1:39:59] you'll find that that's the least used
[1:40:00] app why because you don't listen anymore
[1:40:02] because your appetite has been filled
[1:40:04] you've been filled up with things of the
[1:40:06] world and you've been given in to the
[1:40:07] world and say well well I I'm full I I
[1:40:10] don't need I have need of nothing listen
[1:40:11] that's a leot ofan mentality that's a
[1:40:13] leot ofan spirit but we are not here for
[1:40:16] the leot ofan church we're not here to
[1:40:18] be called leot of sins but you're here
[1:40:19] to be called prde can you say Amen
[1:40:21] you're here to be called out of the Le
[1:40:23] to sin Church you're not going to be led
[1:40:25] to sleep by the lay of sins but you have
[1:40:27] been called to be an overcomer you are
[1:40:30] just like sson standing there that day
[1:40:32] you're more than able to kill every
[1:40:34] demon that has oppressed you can you say
[1:40:36] Amen so wake up sleeping Giants I say
[1:40:39] wake up you're a living body today
[1:40:41] you're you you're still alive the power
[1:40:43] is still there you can reach around
[1:40:44] there brother Ram said he can reach
[1:40:45] around there and still feel he could
[1:40:47] feel those locks beginning to grow he
[1:40:48] could actually feel the the faith coming
[1:40:50] back on him why he started looking for
[1:40:52] that Faith again where's where's that
[1:40:53] faith that I once had the faith is there
[1:40:56] if you'll just use it can you say
[1:40:59] Amen the faith was there and no doubt
[1:41:01] Samson had grown that hair a little bit
[1:41:03] longer than he thought he did and he was
[1:41:05] standing there and he was in a defeated
[1:41:07] State suffering and they were laughing
[1:41:09] at him and mocking him well come on
[1:41:11] somebody and the whole time he was God's
[1:41:13] man for the hour but he had given
[1:41:15] himself over to a worldly system and was
[1:41:17] deceived by it for a time but you won't
[1:41:19] be deceived for long you may be led
[1:41:21] astray you may be led astray but you're
[1:41:23] going to come back well can you say man
[1:41:26] you may be led out to the world for a
[1:41:27] season but you are going to come back
[1:41:30] why because there's some Philistines to
[1:41:31] destroy there's some demons to fight and

[1:42:07] world alone but by every word that
[1:42:09] proceeds out of the mouth of God well
[1:42:11] can you say Amen brother Brandon would
[1:42:13] say it like this I don't have the quote
[1:42:14] in front of me but he said he said Jesus
[1:42:16] when he was tempted by the devil was he
[1:42:18] was an ex he was actually made an
[1:42:20] example for for the weakest of
[1:42:21] Christians you've heard the quote he was
[1:42:23] he was made as an example for the
[1:42:24] weakest of Christians he said it is
[1:42:26] written it is written it's not just one
[1:42:28] quote here one scripture here and one
[1:42:30] scripture here you know that's that's
[1:42:31] the problem with denominations listen
[1:42:33] it's not that I'm I'm against them but
[1:42:34] I'm against the spirit that would try to
[1:42:36] cut out this part you say well this
[1:42:38] don't matter no more this don't mind
[1:42:39] listen it it's all God's word or none of

[1:42:50] believe in the coming of a fifth fourth
[1:42:52] Elijah in this day we don't believe in
[1:42:53] any of that listen you better believe in
[1:42:54] it or you're going to miss it you better
[1:42:56] believe in the word or you going to miss
[1:42:57] it when it comes if they didn't believe
[1:42:59] on everything that Jesus was supposed to
[1:43:02] do when he came they missed him why
[1:43:04] because he came in such a simple way but
[1:43:06] it was a scriptural way and God has come
[1:43:09] again in our day in a simple way but it
[1:43:12] is a scriptural way and he came with a
[1:43:14] voice to call out a bride and she is
[1:43:17] making herself ready to go meet the Lord
[1:43:20] in the air for the wedding supper well

[1:45:30] amen and brother brandom actually says
[1:45:33] that that is what would wake the bride
[1:45:34] up so what we see this morning is an
[1:45:37] Awakening of the Bride under the message
[1:45:39] of the hour but she has found that the
[1:45:42] Dynamics have have come but she also has
[1:45:45] the mechanics in this hour no other
[1:45:46] bride could be awakened like this bride
[1:45:48] no other bride could have the power of
[1:45:50] this bride no other bride could come to
[1:45:53] maturity like this bride why because
[1:45:55] this bride has had an open book what can
[1:45:57] you say Amen this bride has no seals on
[1:46:00] the Bible no more but the seals have
[1:46:02] been loosed and you are awake to every

[1:46:39] been a full out sinner you couldn't find
[1:46:41] your way to God but he came and
[1:46:42] quickened you can you say amen and
[1:46:45] wherein in time past you walked
[1:46:46] according to the course of this world

[1:46:50] children of Disobedience among whom also
[1:46:52] we all had our conversation in times
[1:46:54] past in the lust of our flesh fulfilling
[1:46:56] the desires of the Flesh and of the mind
[1:47:00] and were by Nature the children of Wrath
[1:47:03] even as others but now listen but God
