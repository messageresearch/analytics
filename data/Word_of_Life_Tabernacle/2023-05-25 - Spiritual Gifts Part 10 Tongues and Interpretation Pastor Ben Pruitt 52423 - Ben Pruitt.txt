and stand as we change over the order of the service I believe if you're expecting tonight I believe that God's able to come and meet that expectation oh I love that man in the middle [Music] because I know that he first loved me we're singing Praise to them that much Calvary made it possible that I could go free [Music] in the middle [Music] of me [Music] praise foreign [Music] in a supernatural realm and for you to help us to recognize that or to get out of the natural just long enough to to enter in Lord Where Angels are present and Lord and gifts are here and and the word is being preached Lord may we receive in that realm today or that'll help us in the natural realm to live our lives I pray you'd grant that today Lord I pray you'd heal every sick person every every been presented Lord or that's on the hearts of the people I pray that you'd meet it tonight and we're believing and trusting that you will in Jesus name amen amen bless you tonight turn with me to First Corinthians chapter 12 verse 10. this is uh the last of our regular installment on the gifts we may do one more for with some questions just kind of wrap it up uh in here in a week or two but this is the last of the gifts I hope you've learned something more than that I hope that you have a desire to to know God in such a way that and to be so close to him that these things would operate in your life if that's what would please him amen that's what we want we can't teach people to have gifts but we do want to know what they are and we want God to be able to do whatever God wants to do I want to say happy anniversary brother Danny and sister Vicki as well God bless you guys I I can't imagine being married 55 years I just just beyond me but Jeremy's right there with me tonight anyhow but it just seems like a long time but I tell you what I can't even imagine being alive 55 years at this point in my life but uh but you all are just such an example to us and many of you don't know brother Danny is a reason why I'm here part maybe the biggest reason and the Lord had showed him and uh and talked to him and that's uh that means something you know something we might not think people are too spiritual but when a crisis time comes and then we find out where real spirituality is and so we're thankful for brother Danny and sister Vicki God bless you guys may this be the best year yet maybe this will be the year of the coming of the Lord and get to see our loved ones and wouldn't that be wonderful be wonderful for all of us First Corinthians 12 and 10 to another the working of Miracles to another prophecy to another Discerning of spirits to another diverse kinds of tongues to another the interpretation of tongues I want to talk tonight about tongues and interpretation for the Lord but that is blessing to the word you may be seated I'll be away this weekend brother Stewart will speak we'll just have a Sunday morning service as well there may be people who we fellowship with and and that in the message that know a lot more than I do that handle tongues and interpretation differently than what I want to handle it tonight and that's okay that that's the sovereignty of the local church I would say that these are non-salvation issues in the sense that I'm not going to break off Fellowship from somebody because they handle tongues differently than we do I'll say this anytime you have a church order there is an order and then brother Branham tells us he said you need to get out of order long enough to get saved so there's always going to be some things that happen and you're going to be around gifts and I'll say this especially for the young people we should always respect the gifts we should never disrespect a gift even if the person that has the gift is not maybe the kind of person we would think would be a good person maybe or a saved person or or a follower of the message and brother Branham talked about a woman with cut hair and makeup and that would that would get up stand up in the church and give a tongues and interpretation he said we shouldn't we should try to work with that woman and realize that it may be the presence of God it may be a real gift even though her life isn't right and and so we need that and and we need to work with people like that and we're Branham worked with other churches in his area that leave the message but they didn't believe uh in gifts and the way that he treated them in the church and they they did it differently and so that's okay but I would say for us I want to follow the example of a prophet and try to treat these things the way that he did and that's just the very best I think that we can do so we don't want to make division but we want to stay with the word of God is that what you want to do and so there's no we don't want any seed of discrepancy we we don't want anything shadowy coming in we we want the word of God so there is a true gift of tongues and and it's hard today because it's been such a mockery made of tongues and interpretation because you can go on YouTube and you can find all kinds of people speaking in tongues almost everybody does it today there are major uh Christian singers who'll speak in tongues while they sing there are preachers who will stop and speak in tongues while they preach and and it doesn't seem to mean anything but again we want to be careful with that and and recognize that each man has to answer to God for themselves and we need to answer to God for what we're responsible for tonight now there is a real gift of tongues we don't want the Scarecrow to to scare us away from the reality of what God is able to do in our midst and we need God to work in our midst we we need God we need a supernatural element to our worship it can't be just just us doing what we do and and becoming a church of we say word only which is good but it has to be anointed by the spirit there has to be some Dynamics with the mechanics that we have in order to make God to manifest himself Among Us that's what we want we want him to do that and so we want to we want the real we need the real amen so now in the scripture there's two different kinds of tongues mentioned and and that's the tongues what's tongues of men or languages and then there are tons of angels and or unknown tongues but Brandon mentions those he said now we know there's two different kinds of tongues mentioned in the bible one of them is language that is a dialect of the earth so in other words it would be German or it would be Spanish or it would be a Korean it would be some language that's known of the Earth and on the other he said it's an unknown tongue and again he said now tons of angels is when a man's praying to him and God Alone he said but when he's speaking a language it's to be interpreted in the church for edification of the church Paul identifies these two different types of tongues he said though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels and have not charity I've become that was a sounding brass or tinkling symbol so he's identifying there's two different kinds and he identifies this tongue of angels as an unknown time let's go to First Corinthians chapter 14 and I want to dwell on this chapter tonight as much as we can you know bear with me I'm still struggling with my voice a little bit but it's better than it was thank the Lord for that we're all just struggling a little bit tonight brother Joel I tell you what it's just it's a Wednesday night isn't it but we're still serving God we're still at our post to duty so in First Corinthians chapter 14 he says follow after charity or Love and Desire spiritual gifts but rather that you may prophesy so he's saying uh if you want to have a spiritual gift the best spiritual gift is the speaking of the word or prophecy he said for either speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men but unto God for no man understandeth him how be it in the spirit he speaketh Mysteries but he that prophesies speaketh unto men to edification and exhortation and comfort he that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself but he that prophesieth edifieth the church now we know that a person can speak in tongues in fact we could all tonight an atmosphere of God could settle down here on the building and and we could all be just so caught up into that and honestly I think sometimes we need that but we need that in our in our home because we need that and when we're praying through just by ourselves and it could be such an atmosphere in this place that every one of you might begin to speak in in tongues and but you're not edifying the person beside you you're not edifying the church you're edifying yourself and I don't say that there would necessarily even be any harm in that but I would say the best place to do that would be at home when you're in your prayer time and Billy Brown talks a little bit more about that as we go along now what if someone let's take this just to kind of illustrate the difference between tongues of men and tongues of angels and talking about tongues of angels what if someone spoke in tongues but and it was in the proper order maybe they they did it before the service in a separate service but no one interpreted it there was people with the gift of interpretation there but there was no interpretation it would not be an edification to the body so brother random he presents that question he said he might have a real gift of speaking in tongues but he hasn't got the gift of tongues a language right so there's a difference and so he goes into the motive and objective of the man the hypothetical man if we could say it that way that that's would speak in tongues because if he's got the right motive and objective he's not going to sit there and say well these people refuse to to translate my my tongue so there must be they must not like me or or this church just isn't a spiritual church that's not what it would be at all but he said if he's sweet and humble and says well maybe the Lord didn't want to use me in his service but yet he he just blesses my soul he wants to edify me to know that I'm close to him when I speak in tongues he said so I'll walk out in the apple orchard now there's sometimes there are some gifts that need to be exercised alone right they're not for the edification of the body they're just for us I do most of my singing alone there are some gifts that need to be exercised alone right brother there's certain it's just that's just the way that it is and and there are some gifts there are long prayers that's a great thing if you if you have a gift to pray and pray a great length and and pray for hours and hours that's a wonderful thing but it's not to be done in the church right because it's something that that is a blessing to you and it's even a blessing to others but not for them to hear it it's more of a blessing to them if they don't hear it and God moves on their behalf because of your prayers so he said I'll just walk out in the apple orchard oh God and the power begins to fall on me and I start speaking in tongues he said I come in refreshed you see oh he said you see you're speaking to me Lord You're just keeping me lined up by speaking in tongues now church this is a real thing brother random believed in speaking in tongues right we believe in speaking in tongues we believe in that Supernatural element in our lives but there's a place and a proper way that he taught us to do that and so if there's no interpretation he said then this man could just by himself he could edify himself he said oh you see you're speaking to me Lord you're keeping me lined up he said and Lord today I ought to have spoke to that man now so he's going through the day and he's done something or neglected to do something that he should have done he said forgive me for it Lord I passed over something I ought into father please forgive me have you ever thought like that or I've gone through the day and I I've missed an opportunity to witness I I've missed an opportunity to talk to somebody he said you feel bad about that and directly he said away it goes speaking in tongues he said oh I feel better about it now why because to speak in those tongues like that you just you just got to get close to God right to get close to God where where the scripture Paul says that that the spirit prays for us with groanings that can't be uttered we just need to get so close to God I'm afraid that's missing from the church today we need to get so close to God in our own personal prayer life that we begin to talk to God and it don't even have to be word but he knows what we're saying and when you do that when you get in that Clear Channel with god well you should call it prayed through when you get and when you've gotten to a place where you've gotten past the elements and you've gotten past the brass ceiling it seems like that exists sometimes and you reach that place of freedom and and it's a blessing to you personally now he said oh he said I feel better about it now you see that's all right see your gift is not to be used in the church but it's to edify you it's okay to Shout by yourself it's okay to shout in church too but it's okay to Shout by yourself and you may actually get in a place where you shout and you scream and you speak in tongues by yourself and maybe in church it would be disruptive for you to do it in that manner right but but you do it by yourself and there's something about there's a freedom in that and I'll say this that if you don't do it by yourself if you never get close to God you don't have any prayer life yet you want to come to church and speak in tongues and you want to come to church and act and we're all spiritual if it's not going on at home it won't be going on to church it's not just for give me these gifts are not for a public show it's not to get up and into the front of the church and then and then and then go to pieces and then walk back to the back and chew on chewing gum and laugh and joke with somebody but it's a it's a reality of the presence of God and we need that in our lives Paul says I would that you all spoke with tongues First Corinthians 14 5. I would that you all spoke with tongues he said it's a good thing it'd be a good thing for all of you to do but rather that you prophesied for greater is he that prophesyth that he the speaker with tongues except he interpret that the church may receive edifying right so he's he's giving us a principle here that it's better to speak something in your original language than it is to speak in a tongue when there's a group of people present right we understand that and Pentecostals they had that turned around they still do think oh if everybody's speaking in tongues what a glorious service no preaching no no and no altar call no music just just everybody speaking in tongues exercising their gifts how many of you have ever been to a charismatic church boy most of you have if you've ever been to a charismatic church then you know what and maybe I don't know exactly how they are today I know when I was a kid we went to several and Gifts were unrestrained we went to one that was a house church and and each person just said that was the whole service you just said in your chair in the living room and you operated in a gift and it was a woman here speaking with tongues here was somebody prophesying it was another walking around and giving people Revelations and and that's what Paul said the church in Corinth was like it was a charismatic church that's where that name comes from Charisma is gifts that's the word Paul uses for gifts Charisma so but the charismatics they they put it all on the gift and and that they're all supposed to be going around like that but Paul says that's not the way it's supposed to be he said you'd be having a more do you get more done in your services if you spoke five words of understanding then thousands of words in tongues right we undervalue the power of the spoken word we undervalue what we have what we have is so beneficial to us what we have is so important to us right so we get the they got the cart before the horse and and we'll get more on that as we go along now the Pentecost was taught that the evidence of the Holy Ghost was speaking in unknown tongues now your modern charismatic church have backed up a little bit on that but the old line Pentecostals that was what made them Pentecostal is that the evidence of the Holy Ghost was speaking in unknown tongues and and they took that from Acts 2 and 4 where it says they were all filled with the Holy Ghost who began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance brother random taught that this was not the case that these were not unknown tongues right that that never happened on the day of Pentecost right because in in verse 5 it says they were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews devout men out of every nation under heaven now when this was noised abroad the multitude came together and were confounded because that every man heard them speak in his own language right so it was it was 120 coming out of the upper room and brother Brown said they they didn't they didn't even speak in tongues when they received the Holy Ghost they spoke in tongues when they met somebody right so they come out of the upper room and they come out and they met somebody and they said hey I something just happened to me I I just received the gift of the Holy Ghost I the promise of the father has come and when I spoke when he spoke he was he was Galilean but the one he's speaking to is is from another country and if you've ever been to a country you know we're blessed in this country we're right in the middle of an English-speaking country everybody for thousands of miles speaks either English or Spanish right I mean we're we're sitting right in the middle of a country where there's not very many foreign languages I didn't hear anybody speaking speaking Spanish till I was old until I was grown and now you hear that a lot but but you didn't you didn't hear that everybody spoke English but if you went to Togo with me every service you have to have at least two interpreters usually three because not everybody even speaks the official language of the country which is French so I'm speaking in English through a French interpreter and a interpreter in the language of eway and another in another local dialect sometimes three or four interpreters just to get you know 500 people to understand what you're saying and even there will always be somebody that still doesn't understand it well because and many people speak several different languages so that's what it was like that weekend which it was the Pentecost weekend there and all the people were there from all over the world and so that each one began to hear as the as they come out of the upper room and they were they were staggering like drunk men right we're taught that they they were so under the influence of the Holy Spirit and they began to tell their testimony what had happened and every man heard them speak in his own language it was not an unknown tongue now and they were all amazed and marveled saying one to another Beholder not all these which speak galileans how here we every man in our own tongue wherein we were born it's not one word missed but the brand of sin but the brain is really really harsh on this because now but what's he hitting that they were saying it's the evidence of the Holy Ghost like what happened in Acts 2. but the brown said if you've got the Holy Ghost and you spoke in unknown tongues and that's your evidence he said you don't even have it right because that's not that what happened in the Bible right that's not the evidence of it and he explained it like this he taught us the baptism of the Holy Ghost was like a room and when you uh when when you go in the door he said you're in the Holy Ghost he said you'll see people right just like I go in this room and I see people so here's Jason sitting here on the front on the front row trying to pretend to be interested right and and so you're sitting on the front row and I come in the first thing I see is Jason well Jason is the evidence all right it's the first thing I saw well that's no he's just he's just part of what's in the room right there's other things in the room so brother Brown said tongues and prophecies and all those things are in the room the gifts are in the room are you with me so far the gifts are in the room but they're not the Holy Ghost in fact the gifts could operate and a person wasn't even saved but the thing is to be in the room that's where the gifts are so the Holy Ghost itself is to come into the room so brother random he gets pretty hard on that and and the debate on tongues he says you'll have to he said you'll have to put your version of Pentecost already been condemned you have to put your version of Pentecost in Babel because you can't put it in Acts 2 4. so there's because that's when they didn't understand right the Tower of Babel they all spoke different languages it was confusion but here they understood and so now there's again two types of tongues one is for personal edification only the other is a gift to edify the body First Corinthians 14 6. he said now brother if I come into you speaking with tongues what shall I profit you except I shall speak to you either by Revelation or by knowledge or by prophesying or by Doctrine verse seven and even things without life-giving sound whether pipe or harp except they give a distinction in the sounds how shall it be known what is piped or harped so and there's a great sermon there if anybody ever wanted to get it together but the distinction is what makes the melody of the music it's the distinction of sounds that makes it music right if it was all the same if all these musicians got up here and all just hit their instruments and it was all the same all the time we there's no knowing when the chorus ends when the when you go to the verse the the it doesn't move you at all because it's not music because you can't understand it The Reason Music is understandable is because there's a distinction in the sounds right now and so and it is really hard trust me on this but Joel can back me up on this it's really hard to worship when everybody else is singing in another language very difficult and because it just it you appreciate it if you know the tune but then if they're singing in another language it's language and singing songs you don't know well there's there's nothing you can do it's very difficult so unless there's a distinction in the sounds how shall it be known what has typed or harmed so there's got to be a distinction it's got to be a certain sound right if the trumpet give an uncertain sound who should prepare himself to the battle so likewise she accepts you utter by the Tongue words easy to be understood easy to be understood right so you preach to the audience level that you're speaking to you they got to be able to understand it and that'd be a good thing for us preachers to remember sometimes we just need to slow down till people understand it because if people don't understand it it don't matter how anointed the service was right they need to understand even if all they understand is you must be born again that's that's enough for them to be saved right so they have to understand it so now he said how should you know you don't want to spoke to you speak in the air it just evaporates you're speaking but there's no no purpose to it verse 10 there are it may be so many kinds of voices in the world none of them is without signification so in other words everything every sound they found that by the way all the sounds the birds there's a reason there's there's something behind the sound it's not just babble there's a reason for it and but it's to an audience right the bird's not really singing to you singing for somebody right and so there's an audience to it somebody understands what he's saying therefore if I know not the meaning of a voice I shall be unto him that speaketh the Barbarian and he the speaker should be a barbarian unto me just a foreigner a stranger verse 12 even so ye for as much as you're zealous of spiritual gifts seek that you may excel to the edifying of the church isn't that what you want to do whatever my gift is let it be for the edification of the church not just myself he said wherefore let him to speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret now brother Branham as I've read thousands hundreds maybe thousands of quotes on tongues and interpretation and as I was reading through these and I'm and I'm reading the scriptures and studying and praying about it I begin to recognize a pattern brother Branham liked for someone if they were going to speak in tongues for that same person to interpret it may sound strange but that's what the Bible says if he's speaking in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret that's not the only way God moves but that can be done now interpretation what is interpretation what is that the gift of interpretation interpretation is exactly what it sounds like right it's the same as if I was standing here and brother baduca and some of you watch the services overseas is interpreting for me he understands what I'm saying and he when he takes what I'm saying and translates it into their language where they can understand right that's interpretation yeah yeah it's the same thing with the gift of interpretation the gift of interpretation is understanding what someone is saying and interpreting it now brother Branham says that he says in the interpretation of tongues many people interpret tongues by an extraordinary expression of them feeling to say such a thing that is not interpretation interpretation is when they are speaking in an unknown tongue you're hearing them in English and just repeating over what they're saying so if you have the gift of interpretation of someone speaking in tongues you hear them and you understand the language right it's not just that you're suddenly inspired to say something but you hear the interpretation you hear them speak in the language you were born in and so he said many people interpret tongues by an extraordinary expression that's not interpretation interpretation is when they're speaking in an unknown tongue you're hearing them in English and just repeating over what they're saying again he said if you're speaking in an unknown tongue and interpreting you're hearing in the language that you were born in because that's the only way you can interpret what they're saying because the Holy Spirit has interpreted it to you and you're just speaking for the Holy Spirit I love that you're just speaking for the holy spirit so you're not you're not it's not just an inspiration like a prophecy but it's actually you hearing what's been said now again we need to be careful because we don't need to despise gifts so when we're talking about these things you say well that person didn't do it exactly right well we need to be careful with that we don't want to blaspheme the Holy Ghost right you don't want to blaspheme the Holy Ghost and sometimes the Holy Ghost Works in ways that we don't understand but again we want to stay with the word now brother Branham and God being misunderstood which is a great tape to go back and listen to if you want to understand this better than what I can say it but in that tape brother random talks about brother Ryan and he said brother Ryan was an old Pentecostal preacher and he said he would stand on the on the street corner speaking in tongues and that's a very Pentecostal thing to do some of you Old-Timers know you know he's standing on the street corner speaking tongues he said he said the same word over and over again like that and and brother Brian was illustrating that and and he was just standing there saying the same word and and somebody asked for the random said is that of God and brother Brown said certainly I believe it's of God he said but he was speaking in tongues but I couldn't say what he was saying because I don't know and brother Brandon By the way several times says he he does not have he did not have the gift of interpretation of tongues he spoke in tongues but he did not have the gift of interpretation and so he said certainly I believe it's of God he said but he was speaking in tongues he said but I couldn't say what he was saying because I don't know he said but the presence of the spirit was there now this is important he said so if the presence of the spirit is there and this person is just saying one word over and over and over and this other one jumps up and tries to give an interpretation yet he don't know what he's saying right he said if this man is not giving the interpretation he's prophesying the spirit of Prophecy is upon him he's prophesying not giving an interpretation he said so therefore dear Christian to you who said that could that be the Holy Spirit it could be the Holy Spirit using two offices one blessing of soul in speaking in tongues and another one prophesying not have to be interpreting what he's saying but yet he said it I would say most of the tongues interpretation that I've heard in my life have been this someone get up and speak in tongues Be Inspired in the presence of God was there yes and be inspired to do that and then someone else get up and prophesy but that's not necessarily an interpretation of the tongue and we'll get to that in just a little bit because interpretation has to be something Direct right it's direct to the body and we'll get into the order of that in just a moment but but now and there's so much more we could say but we'll we'll get you out of here tonight I promise and we get out before but Allen falls asleep so he said could that be the Holy Spirit he said it could be the Holy Spirit using two offices that one speaking in tongues another one prophesying he said not not have to be interpreting what he's saying but yet he said it he said the Holy Spirit came upon him in Prophecy just the same time that this one was speaking in tongues and he thought it was an interpretation what difference does it make he said it's the spirit of God giving a message to the church but the interpretation has got to understand in English and repeat back exactly what the person said that's the gift of interpretation right now you say well why don't we see very much of that well I I didn't know you spoke another language now but that's the gift of interpretation like it was on the day of Pentecost it was they heard them speaking their own language now there's times I could have used that gift overseas and many brothers will tell you that have worked overseas will tell you that that's happened at some point in their Ministry but the Branham said it happened in his ministry where a Spanish girl he began to speak and she understood right and that was needed and yet again I don't think God couldn't speak to the church and say something in that manner as well with interpretation but maybe maybe we're not as Multicultural as that and so we just get the word you say well no one's tongues tonight we didn't have very good service that's not true that's not true we're still under the anointing of the mighty angel we're still under the presence of the Holy Spirit you don't realize what hour you live in the bride Revival is not subject to somebody standing up and speaking in tongues that might happen but the bride Revival is not subject to that that's not what brings the bride Revival the bride Revival is the word of the hour the revelation of the son of man in our day and it's here and we can have it just the same as anybody else can right and again I I'd love to see I I I'd love to see the church so on fire for God I had to come up here and distribute some people and set it in order right wouldn't that be wonderful but but you know we live in an age where sometimes you struggle to get people to just come to the house of God but I'll say this we need to be on fire for God we need the presence of God to be in our midst we need that I don't want to discourage that but we also need to understand what's going on you don't judge the spirituality of a group of people by whether or not they have gifts when one is speaking he said the other is interpreting right there now watch he said interpretation is not somebody standing speaking tongues another one get up in a few minutes and interpret what he said let me repeat that interpretation is not somebody standing speaking tongues another one get up in a few minutes and interpret what he said he said when one is speaking the other is interpreting right there saying word by word same expression everything the same so you're not going to have a tons of five minutes in interpretation of 10 minutes right it's not interpretation he said this man might be prophesying but it is an interpretation some of them this kind of a voice giving something just back here giving something else some say 10 words and others say 50 words behind it for an interpretation he said interpret means to say word by word if it's a word of God it's got to come word by word I always get nervous overseas when they when I say a whole sentence and they say Just Two Words is you know they didn't tell all of it so when you have a different length of tongues and interpretation you probably have tongues and prophecy right and then there's there's a governing to that there's an order for that but but that's it's probably not just tongues of interpretation he said interpretation means to say word by word if it's the word of God it's got to come word by word we'll end upon line up online he said that's the way the word has got to come now he said but you see many times in our churches we permit people just to raise up even when you're preaching speak in tongues making an altar call somebody speaking tongues and somebody and give interpretations merely one of them he said I believe I believe the person is genuinely speaking in tongues he said but I believe the other is more or less prophesying because some will speak in tongues maybe for five minutes and the other one give four words of interpretation see it has to be at the same sound the same raise and fall of voice so that's what interpretation is now I want I wanted us to look and see what order that Paul put in the church because we are bound to that in the sense that this is the word of God this is the scripture so First Corinthians 14 14 says for if I pray in an unknown tongue my spirit prayeth but my understanding is unfruitful in other words I don't even know what I'm saying right he said what is it then I will pray with the spirit but I will pray with the understanding also I will sing with the spirit and I will sing with the understanding also said else when thou shalt blessed with the spirit how shall he that occupyeth the room of the unlearned say Amen if I giving a thanks see understandeth not without says and this may sound almost comical to us but evidently in Corinth they were praying over the food in tongues right but that's not far from where Pentecost has got it today now but that's thank God for a message that come in our day and set those things right now he says uh for thou verbally give us thanks well but the other is not edified he said I think my God I speak with tongues more than you all yeah and brother Branham says he's kind of a play on words there because Paul spoke in a lot of different languages but he said yet in the church he said I'd rather speak five words with my understanding that by my voice I might teach others also then ten thousand words in an unknown tongue and he said Brethren be not children and understanding how be in Malice be children but in understanding be men it's one of my favorite verses in the Bible be malice to be children but an understanding be men now what are tongues a sign of because you have people tell you well tongues in the church are assigned to the to the believer assigned to the elect that the church is in the right place or tongues are a a sign of the bride's Revival or tongues are a sign of of spirituality but tongues are actually assigned to the unbeliever and that's what Paul writes here he said in the law it is written with men of other tongues and other lips while speaking of his people and yet for all that will they not hear me saith the Lord wherefore tongues are for a sign not to them that believe but to them that believe not but prophesying servth not for them that believe not but for them which believe amen now watch brother Brown says there is all this talk about glossolalia which is what they took the word glossa which is a tongue and uh and to speak alelia is to speak it's a Greek word they put those two words together called glossolalia which is what you hear about when they speak in tongues in the Pentecostal church he said there's all this talk about glossolalia it is supposed to be the evidence of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and people are thinking we're in the midst of a great Revival he said the Revival is over America had her last chance in 57. right you balance that with the word we're in the bride Revival but the American Revival is over that Revival they don't have a chance well I wish that they did but they turned it down right but we we have a chance we're going up not going down so we don't need to get those two things mixed up but the Revival of the sweeping worldwide Revival is over we we preached about that before he said now the tongues are God's sign of impending disaster even as they were when they appeared upon the wall at belshin's Arts feast a sign of impending disaster you realize what it is in the hour when everybody's speaking in tongues even the Archbishop of Canterbury speaks in tongues right all these people are speaking to us why are they doing that it's a sign to the unbeliever it's a sign that there's disaster coming but oh my we saw a different sign the sign of the son of man amen and again they don't put tongues out of the church because tongues there is a real tongues but tongues brother Branham said that the uh the foolish virgin was seeking the Holy Ghost but he said they come and they got tongues they didn't get the Holy Ghost he said they didn't get any oil the bride already went in oh God help us to realize where we're at First Corinthians 14 23 if therefore the whole church become together in one place and all speak with tongues and there come in those that are unlearned or unbelievers will they not say that you're mad or you're insane but if all you're crazy if all prophesy and they're coming one that believeth not or one unlearned he is convinced of all he's judged of all and thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest and so falling down on his face he will worship God and report that God is in you of the truth verse 26 how is it then Brethren when you come together every one of you have to Psalm at the doctrine at the tongue have a revelation hath an interpretation let all things be done unto edifying If any man speak in an unknown tongue Let It Be by two he said or at the most by three and that by course in other words not at the same time and let one interpret but if there be no interpreter let him keep silence in the church and let him speak to himself and to God verse 29 let the prophet speak two or three let the other judge if anything be revealed to another the Sabbath Violet the first hold his peace for you may all prophesy one by one that all may learn and all may be comforted and the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets for God is not the author of confusion but a peace let me believe that tonight as in all churches of the Saints now this is the order then this is where brother Branham takes Church order from it's it's from a Biblical principle brother Brandon set in his own Tabernacle that those with gifts were to meet in a separate service prior to the regular service in their own room because brother Brown said this that Paul's talking about where they spoke to two or three and let the other judge he said it couldn't be judged if the whole congregation heard it so it would have to be before the service is what he said now it says then he said now come together in the church often a room to yourself again if you have a gift like that and we'd be happy to start up a separate room and a separate service and see the gifts operating it'd be wonderful I'd love to see that but so much of what was going on in the hour that brother Branham lived in was fake so much of it was fake that they couldn't operate under this at all now he says now come together in the in the church in a room to yourself you have a private Ministry it's not an open Ministry it's one that's to help the church he said it's something to help the church but it isn't to be done in the main congregation only the way I'm going to tell you it's to be done so again and you can go find this all for yourself the interpretation had to be something specific just like a prophecy that we talked about not written not something written in the scripture right so I could pull out any Scripture uh at Solomon began to build the house of the Lord now I can say that I can read that and tell you that right but if you got up to speak in tongues or interpret tongues or to prophesy and and said that then it wouldn't it wouldn't do any good it would have no purpose right because God already has a gift to ever standing in the Pulpit to reveal the word of God right so it wouldn't be anything in the scripture not written in the scripture and and that wouldn't be against the scripture but it'll be something specific are y'all still with me tonight so and it had to be witnessed by two or three judges so he said when these people meet together let them let them who have wisdom first come because you see if one speaks in tongues and gives an interpretation according to scripture that cannot be received unless it be witnessed by two or three people two or three more witnesses he has to witness to that that they believe it to be the word of the Lord right so that's very important for us I think to follow now it was then to be laid on the platform so they take the prophecy lay it on the platform and re and was read by the pastor to the congregation before the service starts he said now then if someone writes a message that's been given in tongues or given in Prophecy it upon the platform must be read by the pastor before the service starts so thus saith the Lord from these people who spoke and interpret it and if that comes to pass exactly the way the interpretation said we raise our hands and give thanks to God for his Spirit Among Us if it doesn't come to pass then don't do it anymore until that evil spirit's out of you God don't lie he's always truth we shouldn't be afraid to judge what we have and what we are we shouldn't be afraid to live in the open whatever our gifts are whatever whatever our testimony of being a Christian is that whatever we do at home ought to be able to be put on display when it comes to the way we live our life there shouldn't be any business deal that we'd be afraid of the church knowing about shouldn't be any shouldn't be any kind of life that we live that we'd be afraid for somebody to find out about I hope you hear me Church shouldn't be anything that we do that we that we're afraid to examine by the word because that's our standard and so brother Branham brings us into the light and he says I want you to do this I want you to be spiritual I want you to have tongues and interpretation all of these things but do it the right way and that's what people had a problem with now he said God don't lie he's always truth Paul finishes this up in First Corinthians 14 he talks about women keeping silence in the churches and where we take a part of where we take or a woman should not preach but then he says what came the word of God out from you so in other words he said were you the origin of the message or came it unto you only are you the only church that's right we have to think about that do you get to set your own standard no we have to stay under the standard of the message of the hour no matter what we think or how we think it might be better we got to stay with the word verse 37 If any man think himself to be a prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the Commandments of the Lord but if any man be ignorant let him be ignorant wherefore brother and he said covet to prophesy forbid not to speak with tongues don't forbid to do it we said let all things be done decently and in order now I want you to notice as we're closing tonight that in in chapter 15 of First Corinthians Paul goes into the mystery of the Resurrection he sets the gifts in order and immediately goes into the mystery of the resurrection and if you remember when Paul speaks to the Ephesians because we just got through with the Ephesian church when Paul speaks to the Ephesians he does not have to set gifts in order evidently whatever gifts that they had brother Brown said they had the gifts but they were in order so that was not the question when he speaks to the Ephesians he's able to deal with them as the elect children of God when he speaks to the Corinthians he has to set the gifts in order and then he goes into those Mysteries he goes into the mystery of the body change and the resurrection oh I'm so grateful for that he goes into work this is where you should be even he tells the Hebrews he said you yeah you're drinking milk you should you happen to be taught you should be teaching others right there's things Beyond this and he's letting them know and I found that the most controversial thing that you can talk about is tongues and it's the least of the gifts now why is that because people don't understand the importance of the word itself in the age that we live in Christ is here yes tongues are here interpretation is here but Christ himself is here and he is the word of the hour and if he's here as we've said many times Anything is Possible you realize why the Catholics are so reverent in church because they believe that Christ is present in the host right that's a doctrine that they have that Christ is present in the host and so once the priest says abracadabra then it has literally changed into the presence of Christ into the body of Christ they believe that and so they're very reverent in the church because of that and Protestant churches are not you realize what brother Branham taught us you realize what he taught us we don't believe that the communion bread is the literal presence of Christ we don't believe that that becomes the body of Christ we do believe that you are the body of Christ we do believe that Christ has come in our day in word form oh God revealed himself to us that's what I was trying to show you by the the prophet and the discernment and all those things don't you realize what what we're doing if we're not careful we begin to go back and look at all these things and think well you know we we have gifts and we have different things operating and that's wonderful but where are we at Christ is here there ought to be such a reverence in our hearts there ought to be such a when we meet together the body of Christ is coming together when he's here without that to do to us if we really had a revelation of that if Jesus Christ was here in his person brother Madam says that he said if he come in with blood stains and everything how would we treat him what what kind of attitude would we have towards him he said but that couldn't even be him it couldn't even be real if he come in with blood with because he won't do that until we until after the Rapture till he comes back on a white horse so it couldn't even be him but he's here tonight how are we to treat every service we don't play with it we don't mess around we don't want to get out of order but yet we want the spirit of God to have freedom we want God to be able to move we should be in the deepest sincerity even on a Wednesday night because Christ is here he came down in our age what that means is he can solve any problem now Paul gets talking about the midst of the Resurrection but look what he does in in First Corinthians 13 8 he said charity never faileth breaks away from the gifts in chapter 12 Goes To Love and it's agape love I've misunderstood that myself even in the past but he's not talking about just kindness or even filial love for one another but it's Agape God's love never fails but whether there be prophecies they shall fail so there's a human element whether it be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away these are gifts right these come and go these fall on the body they're among the body and sometimes sometimes they don't operate they don't operate in every service Paul said do all speak with tongues do all prophesy but the realm said if it's in any part of the church it's in all the church but but whether there be knowledge it'll vanish away but charity love doesn't fail and then he goes in chapter 15 and begins to talk about a change of a body now watch brother Brandon said I'd rather have a church that knows nothing about any spiritual gift and just be so in love with each other and with Christ I'd rather have that than every spiritual gift operating in the church whether it's gifts they'll fail where there is gifts they'll bring confusion where there is gifts they can be questioned but where there is love it's perfect now what she said that's right he said and if you had perfect love you'd have perfect gifts Hallelujah see if you operated your gift out of love you'd have perfect gifts there'd be no failing in that that's right he said so work first with love that brings Fellowship oh my and fellowship brings gifts musicians go ahead and come brother random goes beyond the curtain of time I'm so glad God allowed him to do that steps into another dimension and he sees people there and he realizes then that it's not just just you know a spirit on a cloud it's people right you've all heard the story three of people he's beyond the curtain of time and he talks about there's no words that could even describe it no words that could even describe it he said but it was perfect love perfect love what I said about the gifts tonight again I don't believe it's a Salvation issue in the sense of how that they operate and maybe one person might be looser in their Church order than somebody else I I wouldn't separate Fellowship over that but whatever you do get perfect love [Music] yeah right is that what a prophet of God told us foreign should I ask God for of if I love you more because you filled me with your Holy Spirit that foreign Corinthians were up to where we are today another Ephesians perfect love without perfect love you won't enter there would you bow your heads with me without perfect love I won't enter there we've got to have that I [Music] you might disagree with somebody you might disagree with me tonight that's your privilege I I could be wrong but we know the word of God Is Right and we know that God's purpose is to get us there should be the purpose of every gift the edification of the body the building up the growing of the body his purpose is to get us there so his purpose is to perfect love in every one of our hearts I wonder if we could pray like that tonight I want to pray like that Lord give me perfect love like just a small group of us here tonight but why don't we just call out to him for a moment reach out to him in your own way Lord I want that perfect love I want to be able to show it it's not just what I do in church I love to see the the shouting and the and and the worship and and I want to see more and more of it here among us but it's not just what we do in the sanctuary but it's what we do on the outside it's how we treat one another it's what we do with our husbands and our wives and and in our families and not our jobs well we show the world perfect love but you ask God lord fill me with that even more as we get closer and closer to the end time to the Rapture Heavenly Father Lord Jesus I want a baptism of love in my life tonight I Lord as we've talked about gifts and we've talked about all the different things that you do it and it's so wonderful Lord even knowing the gift that you come and brought down on our age Lord of a prophet but Lord all of that Lord is insufficient all the knowledge all the all of the gifts oh God Paul told us that if we had all of that and didn't have love we'd be a sounding brass and a tinkling symbol oh God would you just reveal to us your word today Lord as you said through your Prophet Paul we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye oh God lord May there be a reality of your of the love Lord in our life Lord we would have such love for you that we would not miss it we would be there on that day I pray you'd granted oh God fill us with the love of the word fill us with the love of one another fill us with a love for Holy Ghost Services fill us with the love for all the things that you provided us not just gifts Lord although we want that we want all of it oh God I pray you granted tonight oh God help us to love one another how can we say we love you if we can't love one another I pray you grant that tonight give us that love speak directly to our hearts tonight oh God work on us work on us oh God Do

the word of the hour the anointing of the day come under the influence of the message of the hour and all things can be made well can be made new you really believe that tonight he's here he's here I can't tell you we just need to enter in so many times I still be here behind the pope and shut my microphone off because I felt the Holy Spirit it was moving me I was so in that realm that I began to speak in another language I thank God for that and you all man probably never heard it but how many times has God moved in our midst like that and yet sometimes we sit back and we think well it's just another Wednesday service just another time we'll we'll go to church and put it in our time but God is here he's the same yesterday today and thank you to leave the prophet is here foreign order it
