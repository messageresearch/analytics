Lord for you're worthy of it we thank you for it in Jesus name amen amen hallelujah such a good sweet Spirit of the Lord here tonight and glad to be here on a Wednesday night amen I'm going to speak to you tonight out of Exodus 6 20 Exodus chapter 6 and verse 20 and we'll go back to Exodus a little bit uh this this evening and I may continue this if the Lord leaves that way maybe in the future on a Wednesday night but let's take this just tonight and like to call this amram's dilemma amram's dilemma Exodus 6 20 and amram took him djokabed his father's sister to life and she bear him Aaron and Moses and the years of the life of amram were 137 years I pray the Lord without his Blessing to the word you may be seated a dilemma is a choice that must be made between two equally difficult things I heard a story about two Hunters that were hunting and they run across a bear that was so big that they just dropped their rifles and ran and so they ran out to the uh to a place where there was a tree in a cave and one of the hunters ran up the tree climbed the tree the other one ran in the cave and the bear just sat down between them because he couldn't believe his good luck he wasn't that hungry yet so he's sitting there in the middle and and the hunter ones up the tree another was in the cave pretty soon here comes the one out of the cave running as hard as he can and he runs almost runs into the bear and the guy up the trees yelling at him go back in the cave go back in the cave and he goes back in the cave pretty soon here he comes out again just hard as he can go and the man said what are you doing how foolish can you be go back in the cave he the Bear's going to eat you he said well there's one in there too well and that's just about the way the world is today it's a dilemma it seems like every time you won't go to make a choice for God there's a it seems like it causes something in some other area there's trouble that begins and every time you try to do follow the word there's trouble that happens and yet we know to follow the word is the right thing to do but yet it's hard because it seems like no matter what you do you either you're either going to live under condemnation or you make the devil mad at you well I tell you what I'd rather have the devil mad at me tonight than live under condemnation but but we're living in a in a hard time it's a time of dilemma and there's always dilemma before Deliverance there's always it's always a choice to be made before Deliverance we're living in the time of the Third Exodus how many know that tonight the Third Exodus the first Exodus was a people that were coming out of a pagan Land by a Vindicated Prophet with a pillar of fire it was complete Redemption going out of Egypt coming into Canaan going out and coming in the second Exodus was in Jesus time where people were brought out of traditions of the fathers by Vindicated God Prophet who was the pillar of fire he was the pillar of fire going out of Law and into Grace under Paul's Ministry and now we have a Third Exodus a Third Exodus which brought a people out of the bondage of denominations and Creeds by a Vindicated profit with the pillar of fire back in the church again coming out of the world order coming out of denominationalism coming out of of Creeds and going into the rapture so this is the Third Exodus and so it is a time of dilemma it's a time of trouble but it's in that time of trouble that he hides Us in the secret of the Rapture amen that's what we've been taught now the the Third Exodus is this time of trouble and brother Branham taught us that and I've got many quotes to back this up but I'm trying to get through it in an order tonight where I don't hold you all night so I'm just kind of paraphrasing but he taught us that the very same things that he did in the natural he's anti-typing that today in a spiritual Exodus so so today is the anti-type in other words today it's the real thing the Exodus was a type of today and so the conditions present at Exodus both at The Exodus in the Old Testament The Exodus in the New Testament the same today and so you look at that society and you look at what it was and and the kind of people that they were that was a pagan society and I think we understand today that this is a pagan Society and it's a time of of trouble it's a time of uh when when Society is turned against God and they'd rejected God the people who once knew God and there was once a pharaoh who knew Joseph but now there was coming one who didn't and so we live in that kind of of a society America rejected God in 1956 they rejected their visitation the nominal Church put him outside and you find him in Revelation chapter 3 knocking on the door trying to get back in and so to the nominal church he he's seen knocking at the door but they refused to open and a prophet of God stood under the indictment and he said I indict this generation in the name of Jesus Christ under the authority of God's word for he said you're crucifying him again and so it's the very same time as it was in the first Exodus it was like this in Exodus 1 8 it said now there arose up a new king over Egypt which knew not Joseph so so this is the time that we're living in so we're living under an economy under a political situation that doesn't know God I had become an antichrist system an anti-god system look at the world today you you just have to look around a little bit and you realize that's where we're living and brother Branham said when they there come time for the promise to be fulfilled they raised up a pharaoh who knew not Joseph so if there's a system today that doesn't know God there must be a promise to be fulfilled in our day amen so now he said they they didn't know Joseph and they said they begin a persecution and it caused in the persecution that caused the people to go to crowding together and praying oh I love that it caused the people to go crowding together not not going off all by themselves and sitting in their own homes and and just trying to hide but they caused them to crowd together and pray he said an always persecution strengthens the cause oh my that's hard for us to understand but it's true persecution strengthens the cause many of our troubles is not because of persecution but it's because of soft living he said well my life's not soft but listen there is a pressure on this age but the pressure is there for a reason it's there for a reason it's what we do with it that's what matters right it's what what choice we make in the Dilemma and every one of us has to face up to that today we can't be like Jonah and run from the presence of the Lord we've got to stand there and face our dilemma what am I going to believe how am I going to leave my family how am I going to work for God am I going to go to church or not am I going to live for God or not am I going to be a real believer or not am I really going to follow the message of the hour or am I going to just hang on and kind of sit on the outside wait on the edges I want to challenge you tonight to surrender it all give it all to him in your time of dilemma this is the hour to be more uh more uh faithful than you've ever been this is the hour to come down to a place where you you make the right decisions by the help of the Lord so he said brother Ben we're not under persecution or we are a prophet taught that the greatest persecution that was the Roman spirit and he said it was it was an in a natural way that that's Roman Spirit those 200 million demons in the Euphrates River were released into the Earth you remember the in Revelation and he said in a natural way they were released on Hitler and Eichmann but in a spiritual way they were released on the bride no they weren't after the nominal church after the bride but he said they won't they won't have a persecution in the way of closing up churches that's what he taught us he said before they can close us up he'll take us up but he said it won't be that way because he said God doesn't put his bride through those things but he said there would be a persecution in this way and this is the way he phrases it and feast of trumpet so many people miss this he said notice there she is now she's loosed that Spirit those those demons the same spirits that were loosed on Hitler and Iman to kill the Jews she's loose to call all these little Loose Ends oh well don't make any difference anyhow in Satan's Eden he does the same thing he did in Eden to begin with and he comes to the bride and he says things it don't matter the little things don't matter it don't matter whether you live as a Christian or not but listen there's a bride on the Earth today that's already been sealed away God already got to her before Satan could that's why we've been married to Christ the word aren't you glad for that today oh my now so she's loose so don't think you say well the the political party's gonna uh going to persecute us and they may but I'll say our greatest persecution is these little Loose Ends he comes and Whispers in your ears said it doesn't matter now hang with me for a moment in the first Exodus the political and economic system was specifically manipulated to hinder Israel from fulfilling the word for their hour you want to talk about conspiracy theories they were sitting there saying what are we going to do to keep Israel from getting stronger in the quarters of power of that day they were actually sitting there thinking like that don't tell me they're not today how can we keep these people from becoming stronger now now watch they uh he he talked about it and and how that in in Genesis 15 13 The Promise was made that he said unto Abram Novus surgery that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that's not theirs and Shall Serve them they shall afflict them 400 years and also that Nation whom they Shall Serve will I judge and afterwards shall they come out with great substance that was a promise to them it was a promise they had and the time the Clock Was ticking and Satan knew that and so he inspired the political system to go against the people of God and in Exodus 1 9 he said hey this is Pharaoh speaking now he said unto his people behold the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we now brother Brown said they would have 14 kids every every one of the Egyptians he said God was doing something I don't say we're multiplying like that although some of us are trying but I don't say we're multiplying like that but Jeremy but we are multiplying when it comes to the power of God and the grace of God and the peace of God and there's been things multiplied in our lives we're becoming stronger and in verse 10 it says come on he said let us deal wisely with them lest they multiply and it come to pass it when they falleth out any War they join also unto our enemies and fight against us and so get them up out of the land so it was a conspiracy to weaken the church by weakening the home now I want to tell you that same conspiracy is alive and well tonight it's a conspiracy to weaken the church by weakening the home because the church can't be any stronger than the home is you realize our meetings that we have when the spirit of God moves and the power of God it starts at home yeah our services that we have on Sundays and Wednesdays that we love to feel the presence of God it starts at home it starts at my home and your home and so he cannot weaken the church without weakening the home so what he does is he goes to the home and he begins to put pressure on the home life of the people and don't tell me you don't deal with pressure I know you do because I've been in the workforce I know what it's like I've been right there with you I know how hard it is sometimes to get yourself together on a Wednesday night and come to the house of God I know how difficult that is I've been there I know what it's like to not want to go to church sometimes I don't want to go to church my wife has to remind me I'm the pastor but but that's it's just the age we live in there's a pressure on this age and you don't feel that pressure doing anything else you can go on vacation you can go you can go do whatever else and yeah there's pressure there but it's not like it is when it comes to doing something for God when you go to doing something for God whether that's playing the piano or playing the organ or playing an instrument or preaching or or sitting in the service on a Wednesday night when you go to do something for God the pressure is going to go up don't you realize it is a conspiracy against youth but you have been specifically picked in this hour to overcome that you have you have you young people have been specifically picked in this hour to overcome in laodicea you and you Elders have been specifically picked you you married couples you've been specifically picked you moms and dads have been specifically picked for this hour even though the pressure's on you've been pitched and you're in a title dilemma but you were made for that dilemma amen now he says let's let's see what we can do to get them put them to work Exodus 111. therefore they did set over them task Masters to afflict them with their burdens that's where middle management started y'all HR started back in Egypt and some of y'all know what I'm talking about to afflict them with their burdens they had guys out there whose sole purpose was to afflict the children of Israel to make their job hard and they built for Pharaoh treasure cities ptham and Ramses I love this but the more they Afflicted them the more they emulsified and grew and they were grieved because of the children of Israel why they were a threat to their system the same thing was happening in Israel when Jesus was born it says that it came to pass in those days that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed it was a conspiracy to try to drive the people of God but I love how God works because he actually knowing that this would happen use the conspiracy to how have Jesus to cause Jesus to be born in Bethlehem fulfilling his own word oh my don't you realize it's all in the hands of God today you'll actually use the pressure of the eighth he'll actually use the things that you're going through in life he'll use that to actually bring life to you bring bring put power in your life he'll use that to build a character in you he'll arrange things so that it's for your good my goodness the Egyptian and Roman systems made it nearly impossible for the people to fulfill their obligations to God and to the state I'm going to be very plain tonight that's the hour we're living in they made it hard for the people to fulfill their obligations to God and to the state and yet God used that system to fulfill his word so he's not going to necessarily pull you out of it but he causes Deliverance to take place within that system in spite of the conspiracy Hallelujah in spite of a conspiracy of kings and Emperors and demons and everything else in spite of a conspiracy of the Roman system the word was still born in Judea a deliverer was still born in Goshen and there's a people of God that are still alive today still working still doing what God called them to do in spite of the pressure of the age we're still here why are we still here because we God is actually using it for his own purpose Satan knows oh I hope I wish some of us would get a revelation as good a revelation about ourselves as Satan has about us because Satan knew that God's people just living just going about their daily work were a threat to their system oh my Satan knows that you going to school you going to church you living for God you being a Christian in your neighborhood you being who you are brother Paul Satan knows you're a threat he knows you're a threat and so they try to do everything they can to work it out where you can't make it he'll make it as hard as he can be but if you could get that same Revelation about yourself he knows you're a threat do you realize you're a threat do you realize because what that means is you have an overcoming ability you have an ability to work for God you have an ability to do things you never dreamed you could do you can show up for church when you think you can't oh my you can live for God when you think you can when the birds pile on top of you and the Taskmaster standing over you telling you you can't make it you're not going to make it it's not good enough when the bills start piling up but you're trying to live for God do things in a Biblical way but the bills are piling up and you don't see any end out any end in sight yeah you know there's always light at the end of the tunnel why because he put you here he did not put you here to fail he did not put you here to back up he put you here to be a Christian so there must be a reason for what you're going through so in that light that you just being what you are being a Christian being a mother being a father being a husband being a dad being a spouse a wife just you being that in a Biblical way is a threat to Satan and his system and so knowing that knowing that then we as we begin to look into this I want to look tonight and we'll look later at different parts of the family I want to look tonight at the man specifically amram because we know that imram had to work under this system to be able to make it in that hour and we know that after the fall men and women were given separate covenants and this was a Works Covenant now this doesn't have to do with Grace we were given another Covenant which is Grace which means that we don't work our way to Salvation in other words you could be a bum and still be saved but because you are saved you aren't a bum that makes sense so so now I'm not preaching at you Jeremy I'm that's the problem with a small Church isn't it but but you could be a bum right that had nothing to do with your salvation but the holy spirit inside of you makes you makes you work because that's a man's calling right I hate it as much as you do but it's just the way it is Genesis 3 17 unto Adam he said because you've hearkened the voice of thy wife that's eaten of the tree which a commanded he's saying thou shall not eat them it cursed into the ground for that I say in sorrow thou should either but all the days of thy life the horns also in this one shall it bring forth to thee Thou shalt eat the herb of the field in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread oh no I think that's why he makes preaching so hard on us brother Joel you stand up here and I I we talk about being hard and I feel bad about that even because some of you come in on a Wednesday night you've been Beat to Death all day either mentally or physically and we come up here and say preaching is hard and you're like speak for yourself I realized that I try to get up in the mornings at an early time even when I wouldn't have to some days because I try to get up because I I recognize that y'all are getting up and I'll pray for you while you go out and work but but I'll say this that that it's in the sweat of your face no matter what you do lazy preacher is no more successful than a lazy businessman right because you still got to work he said you're going to do that say till you retire well no till thou return unto the ground but the Harvey's keeping that that scripture alive for out of it was thou taken for dust Thou Art and unto dust shout thou return now so this was we've talked about this before it's it's work and what made it bad was after the fall they had worked before the fall but the random taught us that but after the fall it became anxious work work with worry work because you had to work to make a living to survive right so again it's not it doesn't save a man but it's required of him the Bible says he talks about a man who refuses to work and even when we were with you this we commanded of you that if any would not work neither should he eat well that I'm gonna work for we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly working not at all but are busy Buddies now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ that with quietness they work and eat their own bread with quietness they work and eat their own bread so he teaches us to work now he teaches us also in in Ephesians 4 28 work so that we're able to give how many want to be a giver not just to to the church or something like that but to people in general just where you can be a giver so he teaches us to work to be a giver Ephesians 4 28 let him to stole still no more but rather let him labor working with his hands the thing which is good that he may have to give to him that needeth he taught us to work for our bosses much as we hate that middle management but but he taught us to do that servants he said obeying all things your Masters according to the flesh not with ice service that's men's Pleasers but in singleness of heart fearing God and and he said whatever you do whatever you do whether you're a ditch digging or or moving dirt as Peter's been doing or did yesterday and I seem like the hardest job in the world but if you're moving dirt or you're digging ditches or you're weed eating or or you're working in a car on a car lot or whether you're painting houses or whatever it is that you're doing whether you're alignment whether you're whether whether whatever it is that you're doing whatever you do if you're on vacation this week do it heartily as unto the Lord and not to men right knowing that of the Lord you shall receive the reward I love this of the inheritance because I don't get rewarded much at work and I never did thought they paid me what I was worth you know no matter where I work but but I'll tell you this there's somebody who's going to pay you what's your worth there's coming an inheritance that's going to give you what you're worth and that our inheritance on the other side of course he said for you serve the Lord Christ's work he taught us as a form of Brotherly Love you never thought about that did you it's a form of Brotherly Love because we don't have if we don't work we don't have to give and then giving is a form of Brotherly Love in first Thessalonians 4 9 that's touching brotherly love you need nothing to write unto you for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another and indeed you do it toward all the Brethren which are in all Macedonia but we beseech you Brethren that you increase more and more and that you study to be quiet and to do your own business and to work with your own hands as we commanded you that you make walk honestly toward them with that or without so he's saying your your work will cause you to be able to live in an honest manner so you're not have to steal from people to make it right and that gives a testimony to them that are without you're actually loving your brother by just making a living for yourself you ever thought about it like that I'm going to work I'm loving my brother and I realize again a woman whether she works or not if she works in the public a woman has two jobs because she's working at home and she's working in the public and maybe we'll get to that next time but I I'll say if you do that and hold yourself right I I honor you in that because because in this age that's difficult to do and I think all of us would want our wives to be able to be at home if possible if everything was just the way that it ought to be and we'd go out and and be the He-Man and take care of that that's because we're built that way it's the way it's supposed to be but yet uh yet there's situations that come up where they can't do that but whatever it is that you do you're working you're working to to have an honest living so that you're not begging from everybody are you with me now that you may have lack of nothing so you're supposed to work for money it's okay we're not communist right well you didn't think you'd come to church tonight and hear this did you but we're getting to something First Timothy 5 and 8 but if any provide not for his own especially for those of his own house he has denied the faith and is worse than an infidel God didn't invent this this modern idea of a man sitting at home and changing a diaper now and then and sitting at home while his wife has a career and goes out to work God did not invent that that's man's invention and I recognize when I say that sometimes a man can't work a physically unable to work but there's a lot of them out there today not working when they could be it's hard to find one today that wants to work why because that people don't realize it but it's actually perversion has slipped into our age until a man don't want to pick up a hammer anymore man don't want to pick up a shovel anymore I hope you're with me tonight again I hate it just like you do but it's part of our job it's part of what we do and it's my job to take care of my family and always will be no matter what no matter how much money she makes still my job take care of my family but see you see what Satan does you're going to be a people I hope you I'm I'm Amazed by the people I preach to all the time because you are a people who are going to manifest all of the word not just part of it all of the word you're going to manifest all of the word first Timothy 5 8 you're going to manifest you're going to be a perfect word Brian you're a people of God who are called to manifest all of the word and so see Satan many times we think well Satan battles Us in in Supernatural Realms and meetings and things like that but don't you realize he's already fighting at home he's fighting trying to keep you tired he's fighting trying to keep you wore out he's fighting trying to keep you buying things you don't need you don't you think he's fighting constantly fighting to keep you in a place where you don't have time to care for your family you don't have time to care for their spiritual needs you don't have time to care for their natural needs fighting constantly to keep us busy oh my God it's the God of this evil age doing that and as The Exodus came more into Focus as it came nearer the work became more difficult in Exodus 5 and 4 the king of Egypt said unto them wherefore do you Moses and Aaron let the people from their Works get you unto your burdens get you into your burdens what are you doing we're having a meeting get to your burdens and then how the boss acts sometimes what do you mean you want to be in church on Wednesdays get to your burdens boy got quiet huh but I believe I'll say this I believe every person that here in this church I I know all of you and some better than others but I know you want to be in the house of God I know you want to be in the house of God those who aren't here tonight I know you want to be in the house of God and you strive and you struggle to be in the house of God and yet many times Pharaoh's standing there said get back to your burden get back to your burden and you've got to live in that land you face a dilemma what are you gonna do verse five Pharaoh said behold the people the land now are many you make them rest from their burdens and Pharaoh commanded the same day the task masters of the people and their officers saying you shall no more give the people straw to make brick as heretofore let them go and gather straw for themselves let's separate the money from the gold standard and let's offer them credit cards I'm not preaching against credit cards I'm just telling you what the devil's done in our day let's let them go and gather straw for themselves and the tale of the bricks which they didn't make here too far you shall lay upon them so they dealt with inflation said You shall not diminish ought thereof for they be idle therefore they cry saying let us go and sacrifice to our God can you imagine how this made a Godly Man like Abraham feel as the pressure to work begin to increase and the entire political system was against his family operating the way it was supposed to oh my as I said a dilemma is a choice that must be made between two equally difficult things would he work or pray it was a real dilemma did both brother Brown tells the story how Abraham come home he told the little drama of it Abraham come home and told the boy he told his wife he said I'm just so tired today I just feel like dying I'm not able to go another day he goes up and sleeps for a few you've come home like that before I'm sure you've come home from work I've come home some days wishing I could get fired not for me well yeah back when I was in the workforce come on wishing I could get fired you had a hard day and yeah yeah come home in that situation he felt like I'm not worried it's not worth living anymore all I do is work and he'd come and he went and slept for a few hours to come back down and said you're not gonna believe what I saw I saw little children hooked up to an ox cart and instead of making making the auction pull it they were making the children pull it they're putting the children to work and it seemed like that that my job's just getting harder and harder and I got a maniac boss so brother Branham called him a maniac for a boss a Taskmaster out there Maniac screaming at me all day screaming at me trying to make me work trying to make me trying to make the people work harder we can't work no harder we don't have the ability to do it and he said we're supposed to be the people of God but it seems like he doesn't care now I'm gonna be real with you tonight there's many times in your life when it seems like that God just doesn't seem to care like he ought to or you wouldn't be going through what you're going through but he does care he does care but he knows so much about you that he knows so much more than we know and he knows what we need to go through he knows what it'll take to shape us and make us ready for another land he knows what it's going to take to make us Kings and Priests and to break his people that can judge others Paul said we'll even judge Angels how we ever going to do that unless we get to the place where God wants us to be and so he lets the pressure of the age mold us into who he wants us to be but Abraham comes home and he says we're supposed to be the people of God we're supposed to be God's people it seems like he doesn't care he said he told his wife oh but dear when I pray so much and still God don't hear me and it seems like it just gets worse all the time the more I pray the worse it gets and sometimes you feel that way the more I pray the worse it gets when I when I go to church it seems like I go to church and I'm faithful and when I'm faithful it gets harder and I've watched it so many times with a young couple just starts out it seems like it'll go good for a while and then work will hit him really hard hit him really hard in some way if it's not work it'll be it'll be their health or it'll be their family or it'll be something else it'll hit them real hard why because he's trying to get him to give up because he realizes the damage that a couple surrendered to God can do he remembers Abraham and talk about he remembers Mary and Joseph amen and he realizes what how hard it is yeah how hard it's going to be he knows how hard you're going to make his life huh you're gonna shake the enemy one day so he's trying to shake you first Moses would stand before pharaoh and say let my people go but first his mom and dad had to be challenged with a dilemma seems like a man would just quit but amram couldn't quit just something in him something kept holding him I'm so glad for that something today he had a little room where he prayed all night and his job at the room said was to make bricks to house Idols all day he'd go out and make bricks so that they'd have a place to put their idolatrous images and then he'd come back and pray to the real God and he wondered sometimes why the real God didn't answer but he got desperate brother Brown said this real Christian man down there working like that for the enemy but he was a slave he was in bondage he had to do it every night when he would come home he would pray and go up the steps again and pray and pray and pray and come back down got no better kept getting worse little old frail body he said he lost a lot of weight up the creaky steps he goes over there kneels down and he said oh Jehovah oh he said he finally got so bad things got so bad and they were talking about aborting the children throwing them in the river and all the things they were talking about just like today just like today and he got so desperate oh my god oh I believe it's time for people to get desperate today he got so desperate he prayed like he never had before and he said Jehovah looky here you're a real God we believe you got ears we believe he got eyes you know all things we believe you're the god of the Hebrews we're the people of the promise how many people believe that tonight we believe you keep your word should look at these heathens out there how they're taking our chief labor building great big roads and idols and everything you Jehovah would you sit in heaven and let the heathens rule over you he said I don't believe you'll do it he said I still don't believe he'll do it when the Devil comes in God is still God he's not going to let that situation stay like it is you you just spare up you stay where you are remember he's not going to let that situation remain like it is he's still God he'll either take you out of the situation or he'll take the situation away from you he's still God God is still God but he'll do it when it's time he said he'll not permit those Devils to do that I believe that today when the fashion and nonsense and all just tell me about going on still God still Reigns and he is still God you won't learn that on Facebook you won't learn that down at the Dollar General you're not going to learn that down at the coffee shop brother Danny but he's still God he's still the same yesterday today and forever he never changes he steals Jehovah Jireh he's still a provider he's still able to break every enemy Break Every Chain he's still God amen you see what we need today is somebody like amram the burden on their heart who will stay there and pray it through until the heavens is split open Yonder and God comes down and answers prayer he said one day hammerham got desperate and he got to praying he said the light come in the room and he said there's good an angel with a sword and he pointed it towards the North oh my and he said that you're about to be delivered hallelujah oh we've had an angel in our day a mighty Angel put his feet on the land in the sea and he stood with an open book and a sword of the word was in his hand he said you're about to be delivered the Rapture is on stood there and he said he said it's on I want to encourage you tonight if you're going through these kinds of things and you're struggling I believe the lord gave me this and I know I know many times it's hard as a pastor because I know what some of you are going through but I'm not preaching at that tonight I'm preaching something God put on my heart and we see the angel of God standing in this age and saying you're going to make it there's coming it's Deliverance there's something coming your prayers been answered but you know what he did the next day he goes out to work nothing changed but he had a promise oh God oh one of these days church is not going to be like it is now one of these days we're going to leave this world one of these days is don't give up hope don't go looking for something else something better this isn't the time to do that this is the time to believe the word because an angel stood in our age and said he's coming oh my all the fellows up there he said the next day he goes out to work all the fellows up there they notice amram instead of coming being all stooped down and weary he had his shoulders up amen isn't that how you feel sometimes after you come out of the presence of God I think we need to pray through more often I think we need to have a church service sometimes where we just really get drunk on the spirit of God because you come out of there like the mouse that fell into a brewery and he come out and said where's that cat that's the way we feel when we come out of the presence of God oh my Hammer I'm standing there got his shoulders flown back instead of coming stoop down he said pass some more bricks Hallelujah come on let's go what's the matter glory to God God is going to answer prayer he said you know what makes you feel good when you get an answer he said don't we know that pop and Mom when God gives an answer you don't have to see a vision just know the answer is there Hallelujah so that's all you just know the answer is there right he said now listen close now I want you to listen what happened he said now you know after a while all right amram what's the matter with you God is going to answer prayer God is going to answer prayer well how is he going to answer prayer that don't make any difference I don't feel well I still got the old boss over me hollering at me I'm still in trouble at work I still got the problem but I know that God is able [Applause] how many believe that tonight he's able he's appeared to me through the word he's spoken to me said you don't have to have a vision just pray through and know the answer is already here amen how's it going to answer prayer that don't make any difference when a guy walked up and said now when do you think he'll answer he said well I ain't going to tell you because you're an unbeliever anyhow pass me some more bricks don't make any difference no sir certainly not pass some more bricks Hallelujah he said he's going to answer prayer he said that's the way you feel when you know it's going to happen hey sometimes we have to make a choice whether we're going to serve God or money whether we're going to serve God or the system and again what did amram do he just kept doing what he was doing but he believed the promise are you with me now he believed the promise see we don't bargain with the Devil there has to be some things in your life that are non-negotiable just they're just not negotiable I know for many of you women that's cutting your hair right that's one of those things you're not going to cut your hair why because you believe what God Said for my wife that that's all her life she's never cut her hair she that as far as I can remember anyway and I've been married to her most of her life she never cut her hair but there's a reason for that it's not because I stand over all the time so you better not go to the beauty shop because she believes God's word that's non-negotiable not even going to start if I come to eat something you told you I think the Lord would be all right with us we just started cutting her hair and wearing makeup you know what well you women anyway if I come to you and told you that you know what you would say hahaha yeah you'd say we're going to find a different pastor and you should you should why it's non-negotiable some things have to be going to church has to be one of those things right if it's negotiable Satan will negotiate and you'll end up making bricks without straw right every time you bargain with the devil you lose but Moses come up finally he said we won't leave one hoof behind we're not going to negotiate no more we're going to wait and see what God does Amen oh it's time we quit negotiate with the Enemy and say I'm gonna I'm gonna believe what God Said I believe he'll take care of me I believe he's Jehovah Jireh I believe he'll improvide in some way some way he's going to do it he's done it before I've seen him do it before many of you Elders can say Amen to that because years ago you you quit negotiating with the devil and you said I'm gonna go to church I'm gonna raise my family in church and your kids and your grandkids some of your great grandkids are in church because of that today because of that it works every one of the disciples had to change occupations when they met Jesus have you ever thought about that I'm not saying you do it's not what I'm saying but did you ever think about that why because he became first in their lives Matthew 16 24 said Gee Jesus told his disciples If any man will come after me let him deny himself take up his cross and follow me for whosoever will save his life shall lose it brother Branham has the children in in teaching on Moses he has the children to repeat this first at the the correlating verse in in Mark where he says the same thing whosoever will save his life shall lose it whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it for what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul what shall a man give in exchange for his soul and then you find the Rich Young Ruler in Matthew 19 that actually here the disciples had followed Jesus and the rich and ruler wanted to follow Jesus but he wanted to follow in his own way and so Jesus looked at him and said to follow me you're going to have to endure hardness yeah there's going to be trouble because you're going to have to sell what you have and follow me that's what it took in that hour to be a disciple you had to become homeless yeah yeah you become an itinerant homeless a bunch of homeless people wandering around following the Messiah because they didn't have live streaming right they weren't live streaming the feeding the five thousand if you want to see what Jesus was doing you had to be there if you want to be his disciple hear what he taught you had to be there so they had to be there and so they gave up everything oh my I think there's a special place for those men and those women too that gave up everything because it wasn't just the men there were 12 disciples but then there were women that gave up everything too and followed Jesus Mary Magdalene was one there there was women that gave up everything to go follow Jesus Matthew 19 27 and answered Peter this is after the Rich Young Ruler comes to him and he went away sorrowful and he wasn't willing to give it all up and Peter said to Jesus Peter being a businessman since it's an opportunity he says hey wait a minute if if him he refused to forsake all and he was lost what about us and for Sook all yeah what are we gonna have amen and Jesus said verily I say unto you that ye which have followed me in the Regeneration when the son of man shall sit in the Throne of his glory you should also shall sit upon 12 Thrones judging the 12 tribes of Israel and everyone that hath forsaken houses or Brethren or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands for my namesake shall receive a hundredfold and shall inherit eternity everlasting life listen he doesn't receive a hundredfold over there he receives a hundredfold here and inherits everlasting life many that are first shall be last and the last shall be first with the scriptural principle you'd be better off if you put God first financially you'd be better off if you put God first Matthew 6 31. you say how can you say that because the Bible says that yeah Matthew 6 31 therefore take no thought I know this doesn't mean you can't plan for retirement but if you go back in the original it's anxious thought don't worry about it take no thought saying what shall we eat or what should we drink or where with all should we be clothed after all these things to the Gentiles seek for your heavenly father knoweth that you have need of all these things he says not that you don't need them you need them he wants you to wear clothes he wants you to have something to eat he knows you have neither those things but seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you Abraham I think of him as we're getting close to time to close now if you just hang with me for another moment Abraham was up there with with uh with lot you remember and he had a dilemma he faced The Dilemma what's he going to do he has to separate from law because he told him when you've when you separated from your brethren he said then you can follow me and he's and lot was always a hair in the biscuit because he's always halfway between the church and the world so their herdsmen got to strive God created Strife between the herdsmen and allowed that to happen and and so when they got to Flushing fighting with one another he said well let's just go different ways he said if you choose this way I'll go this way and knowing which way lot would choose because a lot wasn't a man to turn down a well-watered plane he wasn't a man to turn down a good job I hope you hear me tonight and Abraham knew he said I just got to go the opposite direction he does well the opposite direction was a plane but it wasn't well watered it was a desert and so he takes his wife and Abraham was a rich man but he was going to become less rich by making this decision right and so now brother Brown says this he said notice Abraham up there with Sarah his wife he said no doubt but many times the millbarrow got way down to the bottom but they still serve the Lord they were in the perfect will of God though they had to suffer just a little bit to make ends meet I told somebody I think brother Isaac I told you and Catherine the other day every couple needs to go through that you know at the beginning of their marriage and and he is about a week out and he said I'm done with it it's okay that's enough scraped the bottle from the barrel enough beating them oats brother talked about something I've eaten him enough you know give me that long face so I I'm ready to have some money but you know that's the way we feel sometimes Abraham and Sarah were in the perfect will of God and everybody probably telling her off you'd move here you'd have more money if you do this you'd have more money if you go here and do this whatever you probably would but you don't and it may be right for you to do that but make sure it's in the will of God make sure you pray about it I can't tell you whether or not to go it would be a misuse and abuse of my authority to tell you to take a job or not to take a job but I can tell you what the word says right so they were in the perfect will of God they said to suffer a little bit to make ends meet amen he said nearly everyone that really truly serves God meets them kind of times sure we do sometimes you wonder how you're going to get the kitties some shoes for school how are you going to make this bill and that bill you say well my parents don't have to worry about that well they did 30 years ago he was just too little to remember how are you going to make this bill and that bill he said don't worry he said there's only one thing to do is rest on his promise he said I've never seen the righteous forsaken I've never seen a seat back in breath I can say that as David said it thousands of years ago Brother David but I can say it again I can say it again today he said I have never seen his seed forsaken I've been down but I've not been out Paul said I've been persecuted but not forsaken I've been beaten with stripes but he never left me he never left me alone and when my time come to die it was to live with Christ and to die was gain listen to me every one of us are in that same place today God doesn't care for us less than he does his prophets he doesn't care for us less than he did his impossible he cares for us that much more here at the end time where his bride he loves us he cares about you and he we have never seen a case where the righteous was forsaken never that's the word of God Satan telling you that you're going to be forsaken it's him speaking in your mind telling you well I can't do it or I'll lose everything no I've never seen the righteous forsaken it doesn't matter he said you just served God the pressure's on it's a dilemma but as the musicians come I I like what brother Branham was told when the tongues you remember we talked about tongues here not long ago there was a man by the name of Danny Henry that spoke in tongues he didn't speak French but he spoke in French and there were four people I think he said there that were interpreters friends that understood French all of them wrote it down it was the same all of them he spoke in French and this is part of what he said I love this the brother Brandon could have had all the money he wanted all he had to do was take the check all he had to do was go where they wanted him to go you could have all the money he wanted but I'm so glad he didn't foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign because he knew you would they told him he said because I was chosen a narrow path the harder way now let's walk of your own choosing thou has picked the correct and precise decision and it is my way because of this momentous decision a huge portion of Heaven awaits Thee I love that listen there's a God who sees there's a God who knows that's what Imran was sitting there in his house as he spreading the crowned up to God he said God your God with ears your God with eyes you see you hear I wonder how many of us realize that tonight you're a God that knows what I'm going through and because he knows what you're going through he told those who are suffering during the church ages either under under all kinds of persecution physical persecution he told him he said I know and that's all he said he didn't say I'll take it away from you I'll deliver you from it he said I know but a prophet of God stood in this age and said it was enough for him to know because his love was elected they could not die they may have been slaughtered by the enemy but they could not die because they were goddess children they were the seed of God because you picked this harder way because of this moment this decision a huge version of Heaven I'll wait you would you bow your heads with me I don't know what the harder way means for you it might mean more hours at work might mean less begging bread [Music] he said well I had to ask at one time for help but you didn't have to beg that God had somebody that would help you well I brother Ben I I'm in trouble today I don't know what the future holds let him take over let it let him take your bank account let the word be in charge of your bank account let him be in charge of your job let him be in charge of your marriage let him be in charge the word that created the world poke a world and Earth into existence and all that you see were created out of things which were not by faith let that word dwell in you and let it let it rule your life let it let it be number one and God will make things come out all right it'll be okay don't let Satan don't let Satan pile you up with so many burdens I think of the children of Israel when their deliverer came and after he came it didn't go like they thought it should they wanted to Stone Moses and Aaron because things weren't going like they thought they should sometimes that's the position we get in but just hold on judgments come into this nation the Rapture is coming for the bride won't be long I don't I don't know what that means even I don't know what long means in God's time but I know it won't be long coming sin his presence among his the revealing of the son of man the word of God in our day to tell us and to speak to us Point northward there's there it is there's the land there's a Promised Land you're going to get out of here one of these days it's gonna be okay hold on raise your families be an example Lord when the presence we were able to worship somehow you kept
