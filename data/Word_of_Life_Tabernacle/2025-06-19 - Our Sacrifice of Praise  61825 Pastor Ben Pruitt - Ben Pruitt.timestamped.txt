[25:55] [Music]
[26:05] We are prone to wonder
[26:09] in this house we're in.
[26:13] But we've learned by revelation.
[26:18] the inner man can overcome this house of
[26:23] sin.
[26:26] And as we grow in the word, our voicees
[26:33] of praise
[26:35] to him
[26:38] can be heard singing.
[26:47] You are perfect.
[26:52] You are holy.
[26:56] You are faithful.
[26:59] You
[27:01] are true.
[27:05] And I long
[27:08] to live with you in glory.
[27:17] Lord,
[27:19] make me more like you.
[27:23] [Music]
[27:25] Today the message of
[27:29] the hour
[27:31] has said
[27:34] you're not the son or daughter
[27:38] of a fleshly mom or dad.
[27:42] But we're born through a new birth. Even
[27:47] if we listen closely, the voice
[27:51] of our husband
[27:54] can be heard singing
[27:59] in me.
[28:03] You are perfect.
[28:08] You are holy.
[28:12] You've been faithful.
[28:15] you have in true
[28:21] and I'm taking you to live with me in
[28:25] glory.

[28:33] I look at you, I see me.
[28:39] Little bride, you're perfect.
[28:44] You are holy.
[28:48] You've been faithful.
[28:51] You have been true.
[28:57] And I'm taking you to live with me in
[29:01] glory.
[29:05] [Music]
[29:08] When I look at you,
[29:12] when
[29:14] I look at you,
[29:16] when
[29:18] I look at you, I see me.
[29:26] [Applause]
[29:31] Hey man, did you enjoy that tonight?
[29:34] But aren't you thankful? We're perfect
[29:37] the way he looks at us. And that, you
[29:39] know, the way we look at ourselves, we
[29:41] wouldn't think much about that. But I'm
[29:43] just glad for the blood. Aren't you glad
[29:45] for the blood tonight? I wonder if we
[29:47] could stand and sing this one here.
[29:48] Jesus, hold my hand in the key of F.
[29:53] Well, as I travel through this pilgrim
[29:57] land, there is a friend who walks with
[30:01] me.
[30:03] Well, he leads me safely through the
[30:06] sinking sand. It is the Christ of
[30:10] Calary.
[30:15] This would be my prayer, dear Lord, each
[30:18] day to help me do the best that I can.
[30:24] For I need thy life to guide me day and
[30:29] night. Blessed Jesus, hold my hand.

[31:22] that I may see the blessed way.
[31:28] Oh, and keep me that I may be holy thine
[31:33] and sing redemption
[31:35] song someday.
[31:39] Oh yes, I will be a soldier. Brave and
[31:43] true and ever firmly take a stand.
[31:49] Oh, as I onward go and daily meet the
[31:54] foe. Blessed Jesus, hold my hand with
[31:59] all your hearts. Now we're singing
[32:01] Jesus.
[32:03] Hold my hand.
[32:05] Oh, I need

[32:36] to meet you there.
[32:39] Hold my hand.
[32:42] Oh, and when I wandered through the
[32:46] valley
[32:48] toward the setting
[32:50] of the sun,
[32:53] won't you lead me safely to a land of
[32:58] rest if I a crown?
[33:02] have won.
[33:04] Well, I have put my faith in thee, dear
[33:08] Lord, that I may reach the golden
[33:12] strand.
[33:14] Well, there's no other friend on whom I
[33:18] can depend. Blessed Jesus,
[33:22] hold my hand.
[33:25] We're singing Jesus,
[33:28] hold my hand.
[33:30] I need you. Yes, I do. Every hour.
[33:35] Oh, and through
[33:38] this pilgrim land,
[33:41] protect me by thy saving power. Here,
[33:48] my people.
[33:51] Oh my Lord,
[33:53] look down on me.
[33:56] when I kneel in prayer. But I know I'm
[34:00] going to meet you there. Blessing Jesus,

[34:38] Oh, when I kneel in prayer, well, I know
[34:42] I'm going to meet you there. Blessed
[34:44] Jesus, hold

[34:51] praise.

[35:59] going on.
[36:03] Well, I've been walking through the
[36:06] valley
[36:08] through this veil of tears.
[36:12] Well, there's times I've even
[36:14] questioned.
[36:16] Even if my Lord was near, then at times
[36:21] that old temper, he says, "Why not turn
[36:26] around?"
[36:27] Well, you can't get any farther because
[36:32] you're just losing ground. Oh, but I'm
[36:36] not giving up.
[36:38] Oh, I'm not turning around.
[36:42] Oh, by the grace of God, I'll wear a
[36:47] shining crown someday. Oh, and I'll keep
[36:52] holding on, holding on to that nail
[36:56] scarred hand.

[37:03] going on.
[37:06] Well, would you mind to tell me if
[37:11] there's something bothering me?

[37:20] God's children be? He has purpose and
[37:25] determined.

[38:50] for that tonight? Amen. And God bless
[38:53] you. Amen. Let's just bow our heads
[38:55] together for a moment of prayer.
[38:58] If you got a special need, maybe by way
[39:00] of uplifted hand, you let that be known
[39:02] to the Lord tonight. And God knows our
[39:04] hearts and knows our needs and what we
[39:06] have need of. I've got needs myself. We
[39:09] know he's able to meet that tonight.
[39:11] Heavenly Father,
[39:13] we're so thankful for your presence that
[39:15] we feel already in this place and so
[39:18] thankful for this statement of faith.
[39:20] Lord, we're not going to give up, Lord.
[39:23] We may not have the answer yet, but we
[39:25] know the one who the answer comes from,
[39:28] Lord. And so, we believe you're going to
[39:30] meet these needs tonight, Lord. Everyone
[39:32] that was represented by an uplifted
[39:33] hand, Lord, I know that you can come
[39:36] move me out of the way, Lord. And the
[39:38] things that I prepared to say, Lord, and
[39:41] maybe you could just move me to a
[39:43] direction would help somebody, Lord. I I
[39:45] want to be a vessel tonight and help me,
[39:48] Lord.
[39:49] take lips of clay and move, Lord, and
[39:52] speak as only you can speak. And may the
[39:55] word make a difference in our lives.
[39:57] Lord, I pray you'd grant. We know in
[39:59] your presence, Lord, even Aaron's rod,
[40:02] Lord, bloomed in your in the presence of
[40:04] the shakina glory. Maybe, Lord, there's
[40:06] a dry stick here tonight that could
[40:08] bloom in the presence of the Lord. I
[40:11] pray that it would be so. Pray that
[40:13] you'd move in every heart and every
[40:15] life. We pray in Jesus name. Amen. Amen.
[40:21] God bless you tonight. We're going to
[40:23] continue uh on some things that we
[40:24] talked about on Sunday and uh we're just
[40:27] believing the Lord will will help us
[40:29] tonight and and uh get into this just a
[40:32] little bit more about our spiritual
[40:34] priesthood. We want to talk about our
[40:35] sacrifice of praise. Good to have each
[40:38] and every one of you with us tonight.
[40:40] Brother uh uh Jeremy and Sister Rebecca.
[40:43] So good to see you guys. and the kids
[40:45] sitting up here. Reagan and Kennedy and
[40:47] the the twins are somewhere. There they
[40:49] are back there. And it's good to see you
[40:51] all here tonight. And it's just always a
[40:53] blessing uh when they're able to come
[40:55] home. So, we just sure enjoy having
[40:57] them. And uh it's getting to be
[40:59] summertime. That means our meetings are
[41:01] coming up. We've got meetings coming
[41:03] right up in just uh 30 days, I think,
[41:06] from today. Something like that. 29 days
[41:08] from today, we got meetings. So, we're
[41:10] looking forward to that. And and we got
[41:12] a lot going on right now. So, we're just
[41:14] we're just uh trusting that it'll be a
[41:16] real blessing to each and everyone.
[41:18] Hebrews chapter 13 and verse 12
[41:26] says, "Wherefore Jesus also that he
[41:28] might sanctify the people with his own
[41:30] blood suffered without the gate. Let us
[41:33] go forth therefore unto him without the
[41:37] camp bearing his reproach." What a
[41:40] beautiful picture that is. For here we
[41:43] have no continuing city, but we seek one
[41:47] to come. So we lay our lives down with
[41:49] him outside the camp, without the camp,
[41:53] bearing his reproach, because we know
[41:56] that here we have no continuing city,
[41:58] but we seek one to come. He said, "By
[42:00] him, therefore, let us offer the
[42:03] sacrifice of praise to God continually,
[42:07] that is the fruit of our lips, giving
[42:10] thanks to his name." I pray the Lord
[42:12] would add his blessing to the word. You
[42:14] may be seated this evening.
[42:17] Sunday we talked about uh a father in
[42:20] the home and how that a father could
[42:22] lead his family to the altar and that
[42:24] was his responsibility especially in the
[42:26] Old Testament. Then we got into a little
[42:29] bit about a priesthood of believers and
[42:30] how that we were all kings and priests
[42:33] and we could come into the holy of
[42:36] holies. Aren't you grateful for that
[42:37] tonight that you don't have to rely on
[42:39] anybody else to go in? But you can
[42:42] actually go in yourself and go in behind
[42:45] and shut the door and and partake of the
[42:47] original mana that was there for you.
[42:50] And and that being the Holy Ghost and
[42:52] the original word and the message of the
[42:54] hour to to bring us back to the original
[42:57] word. And so uh we know that that's the
[43:00] way it is today. That that's been
[43:02] restored to us that we can go back to
[43:05] that. And and we find that in Hebrews
[43:08] that Paul begins to explain to a a
[43:10] Jewish believer to Jewish believers that
[43:13] the ceremonial law was fulfilled in
[43:17] Christ. So there was a law that was
[43:19] ceremonial and it it was very detailed
[43:22] and it was very uh much uh every every
[43:25] little jot and every little tit had to
[43:27] be followed as we talked about on
[43:29] Sunday. how the priest had to dress a
[43:31] certain way and he had to act a certain
[43:34] way and he had to walk a certain way so
[43:36] that he could be uh he could go into the
[43:39] holy of holies. But Paul begins to
[43:41] explain to him and he said we have a
[43:43] much better high priest than the high
[43:46] priest that was there in the nation of
[43:48] Israel. He said we have a a great high
[43:50] priest. I wonder how many of us tonight
[43:52] could identify him as our great high
[43:55] priest. A great high priest. Hebrews
[43:58] 4:14, he said, "Seeing then that we have
[44:00] a great high priest that is passed into
[44:03] the heavens, Jesus the son of God, let
[44:06] us hold fast our profession or our
[44:09] confession. For we have not a high
[44:11] priest which cannot be touched with the
[44:13] feeling of our infirmities, but was in
[44:16] all points tempted like as we are, yet
[44:18] without sin." He said, "Let us therefore
[44:21] come boldly unto the throne of grace
[44:24] that we may obtain mercy and find grace
[44:27] to help in time of need." I'm so glad
[44:29] there's grace there when we go there.
[44:31] Now, Paul tells us that Jesus was better
[44:34] than Aaron. He was better than that
[44:36] priesthood that had come. He he said
[44:39] Aaron ascended to the holy place, but
[44:41] Jesus ascended to the heavens. Aaron
[44:44] could not be touched by the infirmity of
[44:46] the people. Though though he he had to
[44:48] represent the people and and cover their
[44:51] sins with the sacrifice, but he could
[44:53] not be touched. He could not feel the
[44:55] the their infirmities. But Jesus is a
[44:58] high priest that can be touched by the
[45:00] feeling of our infirmities. Aaron was
[45:03] chosen to be a priest by Moses, but
[45:05] Jesus was an eternal priest after the
[45:08] order of Melzdc who had no beginning and
[45:10] no ending. And so he said he's better
[45:12] than Aaron. And in Hebrews 8 chapter 1
[45:15] he said now of the things which we have
[45:17] spoken this is the son. We have such an
[45:20] high priest. What a powerful statement
[45:22] that is. He said he didn't say we're
[45:24] looking for him or he's going to come
[45:25] one day. We have such a high priest.
[45:28] That high priest is Jesus Christ tonight
[45:31] who is sat on the right hand of the
[45:32] throne of the majesty in the heavens. A
[45:35] minister of the sanctuary and of the
[45:37] true tabernacle which the Lord pitched
[45:39] and not man. So he's saying God didn't
[45:41] create this or man didn't create this
[45:43] priesthood. God did. Man didn't build
[45:46] this tabernacle. God did. And so he said
[45:49] he's a minister of the true tabernacle
[45:51] which the Lord pitched and not man. And
[45:53] so he's he's saying he's better. He was
[45:56] the priest and the sacrifice. Oh, I tell
[45:59] you tonight, I I I wish I could help
[46:01] everybody. I wish there was something I
[46:02] could do for everybody. But I'm here to
[46:04] tell you tonight, the very best thing
[46:06] that I could do, brother Peter, is to
[46:08] tell my children and tell the people in
[46:10] the church and tell those my neighbors
[46:12] and people around me that there is a
[46:14] great high priest that's here that can
[46:16] be touched by the feeling of your
[46:18] infirmity. I can't do it for you, but he
[46:20] can do it for you. I can't save the
[46:22] lost, but he can save the lost. I can't
[46:25] heal the sick, but he can heal the sick
[46:27] tonight. He He's a minister of a true
[46:30] tabernacle. Amen. Hallelujah. He was the
[46:34] priest and the sacrifice. Aaron could
[46:36] not offer himself because he was not
[46:39] worthy. But Jesus did. And he is worthy.
[46:44] Amen. Oh, he's every bit as worthy
[46:46] tonight as he was when he made the
[46:48] sacrifice. Hebrews chapter 10 verse 11
[46:51] says, "Every priest standeth daily
[46:53] ministering and offering oftenimes the
[46:55] same sacrifices which can never take
[46:58] away sins. But this man after he had
[47:01] offered one sacrifice, someone say it
[47:04] with me tonight, one sacrifice
[47:07] for sins forever. Hallelujah. Sat down
[47:12] on the right hand of God from henceforth
[47:14] expecting till his enemies be made his
[47:16] foottool. For by one offering he has
[47:19] perfected forever them that are
[47:22] sanctified. Whereof the Holy Ghost also
[47:25] is a witness to us. for after that he
[47:28] had said before this is the covenant
[47:30] that I will make with them after those
[47:31] days sayeth the Lord I will put my laws
[47:33] into their hearts in their minds will I
[47:35] write them so the Holy Ghost is not is
[47:38] not uh evidence that we found God it's
[47:41] God actually giving us evidence that we
[47:44] that he has found us and has sealed us
[47:47] and has approved us and so he said there
[47:50] sins and iniquities well I remember no
[47:52] more he said now we're remission of
[47:54] these is there is no more offering for
[47:56] sin So, I want you to understand tonight
[47:58] before we get into what we're really
[47:59] going to talk about, that there's no
[48:01] need to make an offering for sin. If sin
[48:05] is gone, there's no death needed to
[48:08] cover sin. Come on. Because the perfect
[48:10] lamb already died. So, I don't have to
[48:13] die. You don't have to die. No one else
[48:15] has to die. A prophet couldn't die.
[48:17] People couldn't die. But there was a
[48:19] high priest, a great high priest who
[48:22] offered himself. Yeah. Good. So Jesus
[48:25] once for all, brother Brandham says one
[48:27] time he is perfected forever. Those that
[48:30] have come into that fellowship with an
[48:32] eternal blessing, eternal fellowship
[48:34] with the eternal presence of God, with
[48:36] the power of the Holy Ghost, not in a
[48:38] symbol out yonder or in some word or or
[48:41] in some theology. So it's not a a
[48:43] buzzword or something you say or even
[48:46] something you you say you believe or or
[48:48] or or an idea of some kind, but it's a
[48:51] reality. It's something that that
[48:53] happens to you. He said it's a the Holy
[48:55] Ghost in you. He said the power of God
[48:57] that raised Christ from the grave is
[48:59] made alive in you and you are a new
[49:02] creature. Then you are a son and
[49:04] daughter of God. So when you say I have
[49:07] the baptism of the Holy Ghost. I've
[49:08] received the true baptism of the Holy
[49:10] Ghost. I I have the token on display in
[49:12] my life. What are you saying? You're
[49:14] saying I have the same power that raised
[49:16] up Jesus from the dead on the third day.
[49:19] That same power, that same quickening
[49:21] power is now in my heart and it's raised
[49:24] me up from dead trespasses and sins. And
[49:26] it's able to keep me until that day. Do
[49:29] you believe it, church?
[49:32] Amen. Brother Brandham teaches us that
[49:33] he said it's so simple a fool. The Bible
[49:36] says that that simple so simple a fool
[49:38] would not air in it. It's within reach
[49:39] of all rich and poor, illiterate or
[49:42] educated just by childlike simplicity to
[49:45] believe that the finished work at
[49:46] Calvary included me. I wonder how many
[49:49] of us could say amen to that tonight.
[49:51] Can I really buy into that fact that the
[49:53] when he said it's finished, he was
[49:55] talking about me. When he said it's
[49:57] over, he was talking about my salvation
[50:00] and my redemption.
[50:02] So, I can't do a thing to earn it. He
[50:05] did it for me. This was foreshadowed
[50:08] even in the Old Testament in Psalms
[50:09] chapter 40 and verse 6. I hope you like
[50:11] the scripture because we're about to
[50:13] read a bunch of scriptures. Psalms
[50:15] chapter 40 and verse 6. Sacrifice and
[50:17] offering thou dost not desire. Mine ears
[50:20] hast thou opened. Oh, I love that. He
[50:23] said, "Burnt offering and sin offering
[50:24] hast thou not required." It wasn't
[50:26] really what he wanted.
[50:29] They offered lambs and bulocks and goats
[50:31] and turtle doves and all the things that
[50:34] were required. He said, "But that was
[50:35] really not what I wanted." He said, "But
[50:38] mine ears hast thou opened."
[50:41] Hallelujah. Then said I, "Lo, I come in
[50:44] the volume of the book it is written to
[50:45] me. I delight to do thy will, oh my God.
[50:48] Yay, thy law is within my heart. So he
[50:50] said, I want something more than just a
[50:52] temporary covering. I want people that
[50:55] want to serve me because it's in their
[50:56] heart to do it.
[50:58] Hallelujah. Listen, there's no red heer.
[51:02] If you had a red heer today or an
[51:04] unblenmished lamb to offer, it would be
[51:07] an affront and an insult to God.
[51:10] The one who died for you to offer him
[51:13] for your sins, right? Right. If you had
[51:16] a red heer today and you had it was
[51:18] perfect and you followed all the
[51:20] ceremonial law and you killed it. All
[51:21] you did was kill a good cow,
[51:25] right? That's all you do. If you had a
[51:28] goat, right, that you could drag up
[51:30] there and
[51:33] when we were in the Philippines, I I was
[51:35] preaching one time and I looked up at
[51:37] the up at the hill. It was an open air
[51:39] place and I looked a youth camp and I
[51:41] looked up at the hill and there was a
[51:43] goat that had been wandering around the
[51:44] camp all week. he'd become everybody's
[51:46] pet. And I heard him bleeding and I
[51:48] looked up there and he quit bleeding and
[51:49] they'd cut his throat and and they were
[51:51] fixing him right up on the on the hill.
[51:54] But you know, that didn't do a thing for
[51:55] the service.
[51:58] It didn't appease God in any way. Why?
[52:01] He's already been appeased.
[52:04] Huh? Listen to me, church. We think we
[52:06] have to work to make God happy with us.
[52:08] He's already happy with you. He's not
[52:10] looking at you. He's looking at the
[52:11] death of his son.
[52:13] We're trying to make things happen and
[52:14] and say, "Well, I'm trying to make this
[52:16] happen and trying to gain." You know, a
[52:18] lot of times, I think that's what we're
[52:19] doing is we're we want to be big. We
[52:22] want to be we want to be great. We want
[52:24] to do things and make things happen in
[52:26] life because we think, well, if I could
[52:28] do that, maybe my maybe my my my father
[52:31] would like me. Maybe he would be approve
[52:33] of me. Maybe my mother would approve of
[52:34] me. Maybe my children or my wife would
[52:36] approve of me. And in some cases, maybe
[52:38] God would approve of me. But there's
[52:40] nothing you could do to gain the
[52:42] approval of God. But let me tell you,
[52:44] there's also nothing you could do to
[52:46] gain the disapproval of God. He's not
[52:48] looking at you anymore if you've
[52:50] accepted Christ as your savior and
[52:52] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[52:53] He's looking at the blood. Brother
[52:56] Brandon say he don't even see your sin.
[52:58] He sees the blood, but he hears your
[53:00] voice.
[53:02] Hallelujah. Your confession.
[53:05] Are you with me so far?
[53:07] Yes. It would be an insult to drag a cow
[53:11] and offer him to God for sin.
[53:14] Right? Because there's already been
[53:15] perfect sacrifice.
[53:17] Paul says, "I do not frustrate the grace
[53:19] of God. If righteousness comes by the
[53:22] law, then Christ is dead in vain."
[53:26] Brother Brandham says, "Every chapter of
[53:28] the Old Testament spoke of Jesus Christ
[53:30] and everything." Someone say,
[53:32] "Everything was fulfilled." Hallelujah.
[53:36] In him and we in him are complete. Yeah.
[53:44] Hallelujah.
[53:45] Amen. Listen, church. I don't have to
[53:47] preach another sermon to be complete in
[53:50] Christ. I do it because I love him.
[53:53] Because he's called me to do it. But I
[53:55] don't have to do it to gain his
[53:56] approval. I've already gained his
[53:58] approval.
[54:01] Are you with me now? Amen. Listen,
[54:04] it if we are a royal priesthood. Now,
[54:08] it's kind of interesting, isn't it, that
[54:10] he was the great high priest, but he
[54:12] made us priests. Yeah. Right. Every one
[54:15] of us. We found that out on Sunday in
[54:17] the New Testament that the men and the
[54:19] women both, every member of the body of
[54:21] Christ is a royal priesthood. So, if
[54:24] he's made you a royal priest, what
[54:27] sacrifice can we still make?
[54:30] What's left undone? Come on. There's no
[54:33] lamb, no goat, no pigeon.
[54:38] I hope you hear me now. None of that is
[54:40] needed by God. None of that is desired
[54:42] by God. Right? We stand sinless before
[54:46] his throne.
[54:48] What could a sinless being offered to
[54:51] him?
[54:53] Oh my. Look, what could a sinless being
[54:56] offered to God? Well, we know that when
[54:58] God created, he began to create, he
[55:00] created angels. And what did he create
[55:03] them? He created them sinless, right?
[55:05] But but when he created them, what did
[55:07] what did they do? They worshiped.
[55:11] They gave him praise. Right. Right. But
[55:14] their praise was limited because they'd
[55:16] never been redeemed. They'd never been
[55:19] healed. Yeah. They'd never been They'd
[55:22] never fallen. Though some did fall.
[55:24] Lucifer and the angels, one-third of the
[55:25] angels fell, but they could not be
[55:28] redeemed. Right? There was no redemption
[55:30] for them. And so, they were limited in
[55:33] their praise. They could not praise
[55:35] those attributes of God.
[55:37] It's going to open up a key to you to
[55:39] understand how to worship and how to
[55:41] praise God and and what we should
[55:43] worship for. See, we don't worship God
[55:45] just we worship God for who he is. But
[55:48] the angels do that. We worship God for
[55:50] how great he is, but the angels do that.
[55:52] But when we worship him for his
[55:54] redeeming,
[55:57] right? They could not worship him for
[55:59] being a lamb.
[56:03] Oh, by the angel stood around the
[56:05] throne, but they could not worship him
[56:07] for being a lamb. But but it was it was
[56:09] the redeemed souls that come up around
[56:12] the altar and they fell down before the
[56:14] lamb said, "Worthy is the lamb." What is
[56:16] that? There's something about it that we
[56:18] can worship him in a way that they
[56:20] can't. So, what offering could a sinless
[56:23] being bring before God? These sinless
[56:26] beings have been washed by the blood of
[56:27] the lamb. And so, you and I can speak
[56:30] and can praise and can worship in a way
[56:33] that nothing else can. Yeah. So, that's
[56:35] our offering that we can still offer,
[56:38] right? And you'll find in the Old
[56:39] Testament, I don't have time to get into
[56:40] it tonight, but you can go into the
[56:42] Levites, you can find that the Levites,
[56:44] they were entire sections of the
[56:46] Levitical tribe that were dedicated to
[56:49] music. And some that were dedicated just
[56:51] to praise. That was their job, just to
[56:54] praise. And and they were to stand there
[56:56] and say, "Praise ye the Lord." And and
[56:58] the Lord is good. He's wonderful and all
[57:01] of these things. If you read the Psalms,
[57:02] you see the Levites were to stand there
[57:04] and to lead the people in praise.
[57:07] Why? Because they were priests, but they
[57:10] didn't offer a lamb. There were other
[57:12] priests to do that, but Christ fulfilled
[57:14] that, right? We don't need no priests to
[57:17] offer a lamb. You don't need me to drag
[57:20] a goat. Yeah.
[57:23] Come on, church. You don't need none of
[57:25] us need to do that. We're priests, but
[57:27] we ain't going to get a hold of no goat
[57:28] or no lamb or no turtle dove and and
[57:30] then cut its throat and put it up here
[57:32] on the altar. But what can we bring?
[57:34] We've got a sacrifice that he wants from
[57:36] us. What is our sacrifice? A sacrifice
[57:39] of praise. Yes. Hallelujah. That's what
[57:43] we can bring. I know people don't think
[57:44] it's important, but it is important. It
[57:47] is important because that's what he
[57:48] wanted from us. Yes. Hebrews 13:15 again
[57:52] by him. Therefore, by him. So, we are we
[57:56] are lesser priests. Brother Ram teach
[57:57] you that we are lesser priests. He is
[57:59] the great high priest. So by him,
[58:01] because of his work, because he made a
[58:04] sacrifice for us, let us offer the
[58:06] sacrifice of praise to God continually.
[58:10] That is the fruit of our lips, giving
[58:13] thanks to his name.
[58:17] Verse 16, he he reminds us there's a
[58:19] couple of other things that we can do.
[58:20] He said, "But to do good and to
[58:23] communicate, forget not, for with such
[58:25] sacrifices God is well pleased." So you
[58:28] you love God with all your heart, soul,
[58:30] mind, and and strength. You love your
[58:32] neighbor as yourself. You do good. He
[58:34] said, "Do good. Communicate or
[58:36] fellowship." That's what that word
[58:37] means. Quinnia means to fellowship one
[58:40] with another. Those things are things we
[58:42] can do. He said, "God's pleased with
[58:43] that. I can do good things for others. I
[58:47] can I can do good for others. I can
[58:49] fellowship with my brothers and sisters.
[58:51] I can come to the house of God,
[58:52] fellowship with with my brothers and
[58:54] sisters." That's part of what we do as
[58:55] spiritual priests. as we talked about on
[58:57] Sunday. But the main thing I can do is
[59:01] praise him, good, right? And that's not
[59:04] just for church, right? That's
[59:06] continually every moment of my life.
[59:08] Psalm chapter 116 and verse 12, what
[59:10] shall I render unto the Lord for all his
[59:14] benefits toward me? He's saying, what
[59:17] can I do? What what what does he want?
[59:20] He said, I'll I'll take the cup of
[59:23] salvation. Other words, he's offered me
[59:25] salvation. and I'll take what he's
[59:26] offered me and call upon the name of the
[59:30] Lord. I will pay my vows unto the Lord
[59:33] now in the presence of all his people.
[59:36] So he said, I don't care who hears me.
[59:38] I'm going to pay my vows. I'm a priest.
[59:42] I'm going to offer a sacrifice of
[59:44] praise. Precious in the sight of the
[59:46] Lord, he said, is the death of his
[59:48] saints. Look how it it follows Hebrews
[59:50] there with what Paul was talking about.
[59:52] Precious in the sight of the Lord is the
[59:54] death of his saints. Oh Lord, truly I am
[59:56] thy servant. I am thy servant, the son
[59:58] of thy handmade. Thou has loosed my
[1:00:00] bonds. Has anybody been released from
[1:00:02] bondage? Have you ever been released
[1:00:04] from your fedters? If you have been, you
[1:00:06] know what David's talking about here. He
[1:00:07] said, "You've loosed my bonds. I will
[1:00:09] offer to thee the sacrifice of
[1:00:11] thanksgiving and will call upon the name
[1:00:14] of the Lord. I will pay my vows unto the
[1:00:17] Lord now in the presence of all his
[1:00:19] people in the courts of the Lord's
[1:00:21] house, in the midst of thee, oh
[1:00:23] Jerusalem." He said, "Praise you the
[1:00:25] Lord." So, no matter my condition, no
[1:00:27] matter my circumstances, I will praise
[1:00:30] the Lord. Yeah. No matter what I've been
[1:00:33] going through, no matter what's happened
[1:00:34] in my life, I will praise the Lord. And
[1:00:36] sometimes it's just that simple, church.
[1:00:38] We want God to move for us. We want God
[1:00:40] to do things and we want God to to move
[1:00:42] in a very special way in our lives. We
[1:00:44] all have needs, but sometimes he's just
[1:00:46] waiting on us to show up and worship.
[1:00:49] He's just waiting on us to show up and
[1:00:50] praise him. To show up and begin to give
[1:00:52] him what he deserves. You might say,
[1:00:55] "Well, my circumstances keep me from
[1:00:57] praising God." But listen, that's why
[1:00:59] it's a sacrifice.
[1:01:04] Yes. Now, I want to show you something.
[1:01:06] I want to show you some circumstances. I
[1:01:07] won't hold you long tonight. We're just
[1:01:09] going to go through this and I'm going
[1:01:11] to preach a little bit different for a
[1:01:12] Wednesday night, but I just want to want
[1:01:14] to bring it down to where we can
[1:01:15] understand it. But I want to show you
[1:01:17] some circumstances that are worse than
[1:01:19] yours.
[1:01:21] Can I do that? And worse than mine,
[1:01:25] right? We're going to show some
[1:01:26] circumstances that are worse than
[1:01:27] whatever you're going through. Because
[1:01:29] brother Brandham said these, he said,
[1:01:30] "No one here has symptoms like these."
[1:01:33] Jonah chapter 2.
[1:01:36] Now, I want you to notice the place that
[1:01:38] Jonah's in. Right? He's not sitting in
[1:01:42] church on these comfortable chairs.
[1:01:46] Right. Jonah is not He He's not He don't
[1:01:49] even have a wooden pew,
[1:01:52] right? Like we used to have that hurt
[1:01:53] your back so bad.
[1:01:55] Jonah don't even have a wooden pew. He
[1:01:57] don't even have a He don't even have a a
[1:02:00] microphone. Yeah. Yeah. Nothing works in
[1:02:04] the belly of the whale.
[1:02:08] Right. He He don't have any ability to
[1:02:10] make any extra kind of noise. No one's
[1:02:13] there to hear him. Yeah.
[1:02:15] No one will ever know if he worships or
[1:02:17] if he doesn't. What he does, it seems
[1:02:21] like the situation is hopeless. He's
[1:02:22] complet it's completely blacked out. He
[1:02:25] cannot see with his natural eyes. You
[1:02:28] know how dark it must be at the bottom
[1:02:31] of the ocean. Brother Brandon said when
[1:02:33] a fish feeds, he goes down to the bottom
[1:02:35] of the ocean, right? So think with me
[1:02:38] for just a minute. It's as dark as it
[1:02:39] could possibly get and then you're
[1:02:42] inside of a of a fish. Yeah. Right.
[1:02:46] That's pretty dark.
[1:02:48] He doesn't have a match. He don't have a
[1:02:51] candle. This isn't a story book. It's
[1:02:53] not like Japetto inside the You know,
[1:02:56] some of y'all know what I'm talking
[1:02:57] about.
[1:03:00] It's not like Pinocchio, you know, he he
[1:03:02] he's in he's in there for real
[1:03:05] in the belly of a fish. And the Bible
[1:03:09] says, "Then Jonah prayed unto the Lord
[1:03:12] his God out of the fish's belly." He
[1:03:16] didn't give up. He prayed.
[1:03:18] And he said, "I cried by reason of mine
[1:03:20] affliction unto the Lord. And he heard
[1:03:24] me." Yeah. Remember where he is. He's
[1:03:28] still in the whale's belly. In the
[1:03:30] fish's belly. Are you with me? He's
[1:03:32] still in the belly of the fish. It
[1:03:35] hasn't gotten any lighter. It don't
[1:03:37] smell any better.
[1:03:41] Come on, church. Well, I'm waiting on my
[1:03:43] symptoms to change. Maybe we ought to
[1:03:45] start worshiping God in the place where
[1:03:47] we are. Start recognizing who he is
[1:03:50] right in the place where we are. It's
[1:03:52] not getting any lighter. It's not
[1:03:53] getting any less smelly. But he's going
[1:03:55] to stay right there. And he said, he
[1:03:58] said, "He heard me." What was that? His
[1:04:00] confession. He's a high priest of our
[1:04:02] confession. He heard me. He said, "Out
[1:04:06] of the belly of hell cried I, and thou
[1:04:08] heardest my voice. For thou hast cast me
[1:04:11] into the deep in the midst of the seas,
[1:04:13] and the floods compass me about. All thy
[1:04:15] billows and thy ways passed over me."
[1:04:17] Then I said, "I'm cast out of thy sight,
[1:04:20] yet I will look again toward thy holy
[1:04:23] temple." Listen. Listen. The number one
[1:04:26] thing is he was he was just happy to be
[1:04:28] alive. Yeah.
[1:04:31] Right. We need to change our focus
[1:04:34] somewhat. The very fact that we're here
[1:04:36] tonight and we're still living and we're
[1:04:38] still serving the Lord. Yeah, we've been
[1:04:40] through some things. But I got swallowed
[1:04:42] by a fish and I'm still alive.
[1:04:45] I got thrown into the ocean, but I'm
[1:04:47] still alive. I got I got thrown out of
[1:04:50] the boat by my friends, but I'm still
[1:04:52] alive.
[1:04:55] Boy, tell you what, it's Wednesday for
[1:04:58] sure.
[1:05:00] We ought to
[1:05:02] that ought to mean something to us. I'm
[1:05:05] still here. The world Satan did his
[1:05:08] worst, but I'm still here. I've been
[1:05:10] through some things, but I'm still here.
[1:05:14] So Jonah says, "Well, I guess I'm still
[1:05:16] here. I must be here for a reason."
[1:05:19] He said, "The waters could pass me about
[1:05:21] even to the soul. The depth closed me
[1:05:24] round about. The weeds were wrapped
[1:05:26] about my head. Come on. Look at the
[1:05:29] condition he's in. He said, "I went down
[1:05:31] to the bottoms of the mountains. The
[1:05:33] earth with her bars was about me
[1:05:36] forever." He said, "Yet hast brought up
[1:05:39] my life from corruption." Oh Lord my
[1:05:42] God.
[1:05:44] He didn't testify of the resurrection
[1:05:46] after he come out of the well's belly,
[1:05:49] but before.
[1:05:53] Hallelujah. He said, "When my soul
[1:05:56] fainted within me, I remembered the Lord
[1:05:59] and my prayer came in unto thee into
[1:06:01] thine holy temple. They that observe
[1:06:04] lying vanities forsake their own mercy."
[1:06:07] He said, "I" He said, "If I could see
[1:06:09] the seaweed, I wouldn't look at it. I
[1:06:12] refuse to look at my problems. I refuse
[1:06:14] to look at my symptoms. I refuse to look
[1:06:16] at my circumstance." He said, "They that
[1:06:18] observe lying vanities forsake their own
[1:06:20] mercy, but I will sacrifice
[1:06:27] He said, "I only I don't have a goat."
[1:06:29] Right? I don't have a lamb. Yeah. I
[1:06:32] don't have anything else. But he said,
[1:06:33] "I'll I'll make this sacrifice
[1:06:36] today. You don't need anything else. But
[1:06:39] you can still make this sacrifice.
[1:06:41] I will sacrifice unto thee with the
[1:06:44] voice of thanksgiving." Amen.
[1:06:48] Thanksgiving
[1:06:49] from a whale's belly. That's right.
[1:06:52] Yeah. We look at Jonah. Jonah made a lot
[1:06:54] of mistakes and Jonah ran from God. He
[1:06:56] absolutely did, right? It was not right
[1:06:58] for him to go down to Tarsus. It was not
[1:07:01] right for him to flee the presence of
[1:07:02] the Lord. But brother Rand said God made
[1:07:05] his permissive will glorify his perfect
[1:07:07] will. It wasn't right for him to do that
[1:07:10] to be there. He'd done wrong. He'd
[1:07:11] rebelled against God. But don't you
[1:07:13] think there's something about being in a
[1:07:15] well's belly and still praising God that
[1:07:18] made God happy? Yeah. Can you imagine
[1:07:21] how happy the Lord must have been when
[1:07:22] he heard Jonah begin to cry out from the
[1:07:25] belly of a whale and begin to say,
[1:07:26] "Lord, I'm going to offer my s sacrifice
[1:07:29] of praise. I don't care how dark it is.
[1:07:32] I don't care how much seaweeds wrapped
[1:07:33] around my head. I'm still going to
[1:07:35] worship. I'm still going to praise you."
[1:07:37] Listen, if we could ever get a
[1:07:38] revelation like that, our services would
[1:07:40] change. Our prayer life would change.
[1:07:42] Everything about us would change. We
[1:07:44] begin to be more grateful just in our
[1:07:46] everyday life for the things that we do
[1:07:47] have instead of always looking for
[1:07:49] something else. Yes, sir.
[1:07:54] I got He said, "I'm not dead. I don't
[1:07:56] know how I'm going to get out of here,
[1:07:57] but I believe God's not going to let me
[1:07:59] see corruption. If he kept me alive to
[1:08:01] this point, he's going to help me
[1:08:03] through the rest of it."
[1:08:07] Hallelujah. He said, "I'll pay what I
[1:08:10] vowed."
[1:08:12] Lord, I promise to praise you. Here I
[1:08:13] am. Yeah. It's a bad time, but here I
[1:08:16] am. Huh? We come to church. Listen, we
[1:08:20] don't just come to church for us. Yeah.
[1:08:23] That's right.
[1:08:25] We don't just come, we come for others.
[1:08:27] We come for him. Yes. Yeah.
[1:08:32] Are you with me now? Amen. So he said,
[1:08:34] "Tonight while I have this opportunity,"
[1:08:36] he said, "I may be in the darkest moment
[1:08:39] of my life,
[1:08:41] but I'm going to offer my sacrifice
[1:08:44] of praise." The fruit of my lips, giving
[1:08:48] thanks in a moment when there seemed to
[1:08:51] be nothing to give thanks for. Yeah.
[1:08:54] Look what happened to Jonah. He said,
[1:08:56] "And the Lord spake unto the fish, and
[1:08:59] it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land."
[1:09:02] you want another position when maybe you
[1:09:04] ought to praise God for the position you
[1:09:05] have and God will give you another
[1:09:07] position. Maybe you ought to praise God
[1:09:09] for what that you survived what you're
[1:09:11] going through right now. And then maybe
[1:09:12] God would help you through some more and
[1:09:14] bring you to a better place. Listen, he
[1:09:16] said the Lord spake to the fish and it
[1:09:18] vomited out Jonah upon the dry land. But
[1:09:20] he worshiped before it happened. Oh, so
[1:09:22] many times we worship after. He
[1:09:24] worshiped before. He said, "Lord, I'm
[1:09:25] offering my sacrifice
[1:09:28] of praise."
[1:09:30] Brother Brandon said, "Some folks go
[1:09:31] through a prayer line and he said the
[1:09:32] next morning they get up and say, 'Well,
[1:09:34] I'm I'm I'm just as sick as I was."
[1:09:36] Yeah. He said, 'W what you need is some
[1:09:38] good Bible teaching. He said, "You don't
[1:09:40] look at the symptoms. You look at the
[1:09:42] word, the promise." Notice Jonah, if
[1:09:44] there's any man that ought to have a
[1:09:45] good case of symptoms. It was Jonah. He
[1:09:47] was backslid. Yeah. Oh, church. You,
[1:09:51] well, God won't hear my prayer if I'm
[1:09:52] backslid. That's a lie of the devil.
[1:09:54] Come on. That's the time he's listening
[1:09:56] for your prayer is when you're in your
[1:09:58] worst condition. And he wants to hear
[1:09:59] your voice.
[1:10:02] Oh, I'm so glad he hears because all of
[1:10:04] us backside at some point or another.
[1:10:06] All of us get out of fellowship with God
[1:10:08] at some point or another. But I'm so
[1:10:10] glad he hears my voice. Yes, sir. When
[1:10:13] I'm in the whale's belly, when I've went
[1:10:15] against when I've done something and I
[1:10:16] realize I was wrong. I shouldn't have
[1:10:18] done that. And when I realize that I'm
[1:10:20] in a bad shape, but I begin to worship
[1:10:22] and I begin to cry out to him. It's at
[1:10:24] that moment that he hears me. He said,
[1:10:26] "Well, now there's he" He He He said it
[1:10:27] was backstit, hands tied behind him in
[1:10:29] the belly of a whale in the bottom of a
[1:10:31] stormy sea. He said if he looked this
[1:10:33] way, it was whale's belly. That way was
[1:10:35] whale's belly. Everywhere he looked, it
[1:10:36] was whale's belly. He said, "Well, now
[1:10:38] there's no one here in that condition."
[1:10:42] I think we can all be pretty sure of
[1:10:44] that. We're not at the bottom of the
[1:10:45] ocean.
[1:10:46] That's right. And Jonah, what did he
[1:10:48] say? He refused to look at it. He said,
[1:10:50] "They're lying vanities. Once more will
[1:10:53] I look toward your holy temple, oh God.
[1:10:56] Brother Brand said he remembered
[1:10:57] Solomon's prayer. Solomon said, "If they
[1:10:59] would look this way, if my people who
[1:11:00] are called by my name will humble
[1:11:02] themselves and pray, I'll heal their
[1:11:04] land." That's still true tonight,
[1:11:06] church. He's still the same God. He's
[1:11:08] still the same. If people just recognize
[1:11:10] that what Satan does, he gets you out.
[1:11:12] He gets you away. He gets you away from
[1:11:14] the presence of God like Jonah, but then
[1:11:16] he tries to make you think it's hopeless
[1:11:18] to try to even call out to God because
[1:11:20] of what you done. When if you're a son
[1:11:22] of God, you'll always be a son of God.
[1:11:24] It don't matter how how deep you are in
[1:11:26] the pig pin. He's still there wanting to
[1:11:28] hear your voice waiting on you to come
[1:11:30] back.
[1:11:33] If you could get that out of people's
[1:11:34] minds, we'd see a lot more prodigals
[1:11:37] come home. Yeah.
[1:11:40] But they think, "Well, God won't hear me
[1:11:41] because of what I've done. It's
[1:11:42] nonsense." Yeah. Right.
[1:11:48] He wouldn't ever called you if he didn't
[1:11:50] want you. Right. And he already knew
[1:11:52] what you were going to do.
[1:11:54] Yeah. Before you ever did it and he
[1:11:57] loved you anyway. You said, "Well, he
[1:12:00] gave you the Holy Ghost, but then I
[1:12:01] failed him." He wouldn't ever gave it to
[1:12:03] you if he didn't plan on keeping you,
[1:12:05] restoring you, bringing you back. He
[1:12:08] wouldn't have ever showed you the
[1:12:09] message of the hour unless he planned on
[1:12:11] keeping you in it. If you if you've if
[1:12:14] you've received a revelation of the
[1:12:15] message of the hour, hold on to that.
[1:12:17] Yeah. There's something about it that'll
[1:12:19] it'll bring you back up out of the
[1:12:20] condition that you're in. R said if
[1:12:23] Jonah under those conditions could look
[1:12:24] towards a temple that was built by a man
[1:12:26] that later backslid and have faith in
[1:12:28] his prayer and get the results that he
[1:12:30] did, he was a backsliden preacher
[1:12:33] praying a prayer that was called for by
[1:12:35] a backsliding preacher.
[1:12:38] And hallelujah, God still heard him.
[1:12:42] Forgive me tonight. I feel like I'm
[1:12:44] yelling at you, but
[1:12:47] This is my sacrifice of praise.
[1:12:52] Have faith in his prayer and get the
[1:12:53] results he did under the conditions. How
[1:12:54] much more can we tonight look away from
[1:12:56] our condition to the temple of God where
[1:12:59] Jesus sits at the right hand to the hand
[1:13:00] of his majesty with his own blood to
[1:13:02] make intercession upon our confession.
[1:13:04] He said then don't look at your hand.
[1:13:06] Don't feel your sickness. Look at who
[1:13:08] made the promise at the right hand of
[1:13:09] the majesty on high to make intercession
[1:13:11] upon your confession. He said then make
[1:13:14] it and stand true to it. All right. He
[1:13:16] said, "God, by that faith, he said he
[1:13:18] must have put an oxygen tent down in the
[1:13:19] belly of the whale."
[1:13:22] Hallelujah. He kept him alive for three
[1:13:24] days and nights. But look what God was
[1:13:26] doing. No matter what takes place, God
[1:13:28] will make it praise him anyhow.
[1:13:31] What was God doing? He was bringing
[1:13:33] praise out of the lips of Jonah.
[1:13:35] Out of the belly of a fish, right?
[1:13:40] No lamb that he could offer. Couldn't
[1:13:42] have kept a fire going anyway.
[1:13:45] to make a sacrifice.
[1:13:49] Are you with me? He was helpless, but he
[1:13:52] still had a voice. Come on.
[1:13:58] When you find yourself in the darkest
[1:13:59] moment of your life and the worst moment
[1:14:00] of your of everything that's ever
[1:14:02] happened to you, and this is the worst
[1:14:03] thing that's ever happened, of all the
[1:14:05] bad things that's ever happened to you,
[1:14:06] it's at that moment that you realize, I
[1:14:08] still got a voice. People may not hear
[1:14:11] me, but I still got a voice. People may
[1:14:13] not see it, but I still got a voice.
[1:14:18] Said God will make it praise him anyhow.
[1:14:21] He has a way of getting praise out of
[1:14:22] us. Isaiah 57:19, remember the
[1:14:25] sacrifice? What is it? The fruit of our
[1:14:26] lips. Yeah. He said, I create,
[1:14:32] God has a way of getting praise out of
[1:14:35] us. Amen. I create the fruit of the
[1:14:40] lips. Peace. speak to him that is far
[1:14:42] off, him that is near, says the Lord,
[1:14:43] and I will heal him. He brings the
[1:14:47] praise from our lips. Yes.
[1:14:52] Think about Job. We just heard about
[1:14:54] that when brother Ben was here, I think
[1:14:55] the week before last. What did What did
[1:14:58] he tell us? That Job was standing there.
[1:15:00] He got all this bad news all at once.
[1:15:03] Yeah. And the Bible says that he fell
[1:15:06] down and worshiped. Yeah. He said, "I
[1:15:10] came naked into the world. Going naked
[1:15:12] out of the world, but blessed be the
[1:15:15] name of the Lord."
[1:15:19] God knows how to get praise out of us.
[1:15:21] Listen, if Job if Job had never lost his
[1:15:24] children, if he had never lost those
[1:15:26] animals, if he'd never been stricken
[1:15:27] like he was, God would have never gotten
[1:15:30] that praise. Right. Yeah.
[1:15:34] Right. Like that's we would not know
[1:15:38] when when Job says, "I know my redeemer
[1:15:39] liveth." Isn't that a wonderful
[1:15:41] scripture? Though the skinworms destroy
[1:15:43] my body, yet in my flesh I shall see
[1:15:45] God. We would not have that scripture
[1:15:47] unless one man went through a whole lot.
[1:15:49] Come on. But God said, "I create the
[1:15:52] fruit of the lips." Yes. Right. I create
[1:15:55] it. I I I'm actually going to bring it
[1:15:57] out of you. And we think that he hates
[1:15:59] us or he doesn't he doesn't like us or
[1:16:01] he's tired of us or or maybe he never
[1:16:03] did love us because we're going through
[1:16:05] something. And what he's waiting on is
[1:16:07] some praise.
[1:16:10] Creating praise. Yes.
[1:16:13] Good. Psalm 57, he said, "Hear, oh my
[1:16:16] people, and I will speak, oh Israel, and
[1:16:19] I will testify against thee. I'm God,
[1:16:21] even thy God." He said, 'I will not
[1:16:23] reprove thee for thy sacrifices or burnt
[1:16:25] offerings to have been continually
[1:16:27] before me. He He said, 'I will take no
[1:16:29] bullock out of thy house, nor he gogoats
[1:16:32] out of thy folds. He said, I don't want
[1:16:33] no more. He said, for every beast of the
[1:16:36] forest is mine, the cattle upon a
[1:16:38] thousand hills. I know all the fowls of
[1:16:40] the mountains and the wild beasts of the
[1:16:42] field are mine. If I were hungry, I
[1:16:44] wouldn't tell you. For the world is mine
[1:16:46] and the fullness thereof.
[1:16:48] He said, will I eat the flesh of bulls
[1:16:49] or drink the blood of goats? He said,
[1:16:52] "Offer unto God thanksgiving." Yes.
[1:16:56] He said, "I don't want your your your
[1:16:58] blood offerings and your and your bull
[1:17:01] offerings, your goat offerings." He
[1:17:03] said, "I want thanksgiving." Yes.
[1:17:09] He said, "And pay thy vows unto the most
[1:17:11] high, and call upon me in the day of
[1:17:15] trouble. I will deliver thee and thou
[1:17:18] shalt glorify me. He said, I create
[1:17:23] the fruit of the lips. So, we can't
[1:17:25] even, you know, if God has given you a
[1:17:27] an ability to worship even in the hard
[1:17:29] times, you can't even thank yourself for
[1:17:31] that. That's God that did it. He said, I
[1:17:34] created.
[1:17:36] Some of you know what I'm talking about
[1:17:37] tonight. I don't mean to take a lot of
[1:17:38] time, but some of you know what I'm
[1:17:40] talking about. You've been through some
[1:17:41] things and you know that the praise that
[1:17:42] comes from you today is because of what
[1:17:45] you've been through. And you've seen God
[1:17:46] deliver you from sickness. You've seen
[1:17:48] him deliver you from hard times. You've
[1:17:50] seen him bring you through some things.
[1:17:52] And so, you know, the praise that comes
[1:17:54] today. The reason you're faithful to the
[1:17:55] house of God today. The reason you
[1:17:57] worship today. The reason you raise your
[1:17:59] hands today is because you've been
[1:18:00] through some things. You didn't go out
[1:18:02] set out to do that on your own, but you
[1:18:04] went through some things. You had a
[1:18:06] journey of life. You made some bad
[1:18:08] choices, but God was bringing praise.
[1:18:14] Hallelujah.
[1:18:16] But it's a sacrifice to give it.
[1:18:20] It's not easy.
[1:18:22] Say, "Well, I praise him when I feel
[1:18:24] like it." That's when you don't. Come
[1:18:27] on. That's when to praise him. All
[1:18:29] right.
[1:18:31] I know sometimes we get aggravated when
[1:18:33] people tell us raise your hands, clap
[1:18:35] your hands, you know,
[1:18:37] rejoice, worship, and somebody
[1:18:39] encourages you to do that, and you
[1:18:40] think, "Well, I'll wait till I feel like
[1:18:42] it."
[1:18:44] Is that really what worship is? Is that
[1:18:47] really what praise is? Or is it you
[1:18:50] joining in? Because you know that this
[1:18:52] is what God wants. Yeah. Even in your
[1:18:55] darkest moments, this is what God wants.
[1:18:58] Yeah. Listen, in in Psalm 27:6, he said,
[1:19:01] "Now shall my head be lifted up above
[1:19:03] mine enemies round about me. Therefore
[1:19:06] will I offer in his tabernacle
[1:19:08] sacrifices of joy. I will sing. Yay, I
[1:19:12] will sing praises unto the Lord.
[1:19:14] Jeremiah spoke of a time when the
[1:19:15] sacrifice of praise would return to the
[1:19:17] house of the Lord. He said, "The voice
[1:19:19] of joy and the voice of gladness, the
[1:19:20] voice of the bridegroom and the voice of
[1:19:22] the bride, the voice of them that shall
[1:19:24] say, praise the Lord of hosts, for the
[1:19:26] Lord is good. For his mercy endureth
[1:19:28] forever, and of them that shall bring
[1:19:30] the sacrifice of praise into the house
[1:19:32] of the Lord." He said, "For I will cause
[1:19:34] to return the captivity of the land as
[1:19:36] at the first saith the Lord." He said,
[1:19:37] "That's how you're going to know that
[1:19:39] restoration has come because the voice
[1:19:42] of them that bring the sacrifice of
[1:19:44] praise will be back in the temple." I
[1:19:46] believe we've had a restoration of the
[1:19:47] word in our day. We've had a restoration
[1:19:49] of power that came with it. We're not
[1:19:51] looking for that in the future sometime.
[1:19:53] We've had it in our day. What do we What
[1:19:55] does he want from us? A sacrifice of
[1:19:58] praise. In spite of Leodysia, in spite
[1:20:00] of what we're going through, in spite of
[1:20:02] the hard times, he said, I want you to
[1:20:04] bring that sacrifice of praise that'll
[1:20:06] that'll show the world that this has
[1:20:08] been restored. Yes. There's been a
[1:20:10] restoration.
[1:20:13] It's not a sacrifice for angels to
[1:20:15] praise God. All right.
[1:20:18] It's not.
[1:20:20] But see, they praise God in a perfect
[1:20:22] place. Come on. We praise God in a very
[1:20:26] imperfect
[1:20:28] place. Amen.
[1:20:31] Brother Ryan, a troubled place. This
[1:20:32] world is full of trouble. Yeah. And
[1:20:35] being a Christian doesn't mean that you
[1:20:36] suddenly suddenly don't have any more
[1:20:39] trouble. Preach it. Right. In fact, when
[1:20:41] you become a Christian, brother Ryan,
[1:20:43] when you received the baptism of the
[1:20:44] Holy Ghost and got baptized and and you
[1:20:46] accepted the Lord, what happened? The
[1:20:48] devil come after you. Come after your
[1:20:50] family. He'll try to destroy you. But
[1:20:51] you, that's when you offer to God the
[1:20:53] sacrifice of praise. Before you were
[1:20:56] just thanking God, but now it's a
[1:20:57] sacrifice of praise. The enemy is going
[1:21:00] to come after you. Absolutely he is. But
[1:21:04] he said, "Greater is he that is in you
[1:21:06] than he that is in the world." And
[1:21:07] that's always true. That's never not
[1:21:10] true.
[1:21:12] All right.
[1:21:14] Listen, when we get to heaven, praise
[1:21:17] will not be a sacrifice.
[1:21:19] Yeah. Did you know that we'll be in
[1:21:22] perfect bodies? We're going to praise
[1:21:25] him and we'll feel like it.
[1:21:29] We ain't never going to come to the
[1:21:30] courts of heaven in a bad mood or with a
[1:21:33] bad attitude
[1:21:35] or worried about what somebody else
[1:21:37] thinks. We'll be able to worship
[1:21:39] unfettered. Yeah. Right. But but that's
[1:21:42] not a sacrifice. Yeah. Huh. When when
[1:21:45] when all your chains are gone and all
[1:21:47] and this body of this bondage of
[1:21:50] corruption, this body of humiliation,
[1:21:52] Brother Danny, one day will be gone.
[1:21:54] This robe of flesh is going to drop one
[1:21:56] of these days. One way or another, we're
[1:21:57] going to leave here by way of the grave
[1:21:59] or we're going to leave here by way of
[1:22:00] the sky. One way or another, we're going
[1:22:02] to leave here. This body's got to be
[1:22:04] changed. Corruption must take on
[1:22:06] incorruption. This mortal must put on
[1:22:08] immortality.
[1:22:10] And when we do that, what happens? We we
[1:22:12] will be able to worship and praise like
[1:22:14] never before. But that's not a
[1:22:16] sacrifice. You realize that God wants
[1:22:18] from us now a sacrifice of praise. He
[1:22:21] said he won't be able to get that in
[1:22:22] heaven, but he gets that from us here on
[1:22:24] the earth. We bypassed our theophony to
[1:22:27] come down on the earth and be tested so
[1:22:29] we could give as a as a priesthood after
[1:22:31] the order of Melzdc to give a sacrifice
[1:22:34] of praise. Work's been tough this week,
[1:22:37] but I got a sacrifice of praise. I got
[1:22:40] trouble going on in the home, but I
[1:22:42] bring my sacrifice of praise. My body is
[1:22:44] not cooperating with me, but I'm
[1:22:46] bringing a sacrifice of praise.
[1:22:52] What does a priest do? Brother said he
[1:22:54] makes a sacrifice, a spiritual
[1:22:56] sacrifice. That's what these sons and
[1:22:58] daughters do, which are kings and
[1:23:00] priests. yet not in full possession,
[1:23:04] but they're making sacrifices,
[1:23:06] offering to God, spiritual sacrifices,
[1:23:09] the fruits of our lips, giving praise to
[1:23:13] him. You say, "Brother Brandom, I just
[1:23:15] don't feel like praising him." That's
[1:23:17] the time to make a sacrifice.
[1:23:22] Praise him anyhow. Yes. kings and
[1:23:25] priests, sons and daughters, offering
[1:23:29] spiritual sacrifice, the fruits of our
[1:23:31] lips, giving praise to his name. Another
[1:23:35] place he's praying at the end of a
[1:23:36] service, he said, "We pray God that the
[1:23:38] Holy Ghost will have the right of way in
[1:23:40] every heart right now. May he fall like
[1:23:43] a rushing mighty wind, sweep over the
[1:23:46] building." Have you ever seen him sweep
[1:23:47] over the building? I believe he's right
[1:23:49] here tonight to do the same thing. He
[1:23:51] said, "May he fall like a rushing mighty
[1:23:53] wind sweep over the building. Send him
[1:23:54] now, Lord." He said, "I pray you'll get
[1:23:56] the victory. Pour out." You You said,
[1:23:58] "We're we're a high priest offering
[1:24:00] spiritual sacrifice, the fruits of our
[1:24:02] lips, giving praise to praise to God.
[1:24:04] And may every believer now as a
[1:24:07] sacrifice to the high priest. Enter into
[1:24:10] the praises of God, shouting and
[1:24:12] glorifying God and praise him." Every
[1:24:15] believer. Why? You say, "But every
[1:24:17] believer doesn't feel like praising
[1:24:19] him." But every believer ought to praise
[1:24:21] him because he's always worthy of our
[1:24:23] praise.
[1:24:26] Yes, sir. Hallelujah.
[1:24:29] Again, brother said, "Everyone." Someone
[1:24:30] say it with me tonight. Everyone in the
[1:24:32] New Testament that becomes a Christian,
[1:24:34] born again, becomes a priest to God.
[1:24:37] Yes. And we are priests and kings. A
[1:24:40] priest is to make sacrifice. And we give
[1:24:41] to God the sacrifice of our lips, giving
[1:24:44] praise to his name. You say, "I don't
[1:24:46] feel like it. Do it anyhow."
[1:24:48] That's a sacrifice. Hallelujah. Say, "I
[1:24:50] feel too tired." Listen to this. He
[1:24:53] said, "The devil will tell you that."
[1:24:57] That's strong. I I may not put it that
[1:24:59] strong, but he was a prophet to the age.
[1:25:02] He said, "The devil will tell you that
[1:25:03] till he takes you to hell."
[1:25:08] You're too tired. You're too tired to
[1:25:10] pray. You're too tired to read your
[1:25:11] Bible. You're too tired to
[1:25:15] Are you with me now? Yeah. That's
[1:25:17] strange. He said the devil tell you that
[1:25:19] till he takes you to hell. That's right.
[1:25:20] You're you're to make a spiritual
[1:25:22] sacrifice. The fruits of our lips giving
[1:25:25] praise to his name. Priests and kings
[1:25:28] unto God. You see, the devil hates to
[1:25:30] hear you praise God. Yes. What God loves
[1:25:34] to hear, the devil can't stand it.
[1:25:37] Right. Right.
[1:25:40] Now, don't you want to make the devil
[1:25:41] mad? No. Do you remember in the seals,
[1:25:44] this just occurred to me, so you just
[1:25:45] bear with me, but do you remember in the
[1:25:47] seals, brother Brandon said that Satan,
[1:25:48] he said, unless he spoke it, couldn't
[1:25:50] get to it. Yeah. He said, "Satan can't
[1:25:52] read your mind." Right. Right. You can't
[1:25:56] make him mad by what you're thinking.
[1:25:59] You could walk around thinking, "God,
[1:26:01] you're good. You're wonderful." But it
[1:26:02] don't mean nothing to the devil. Right.
[1:26:05] He can't read your mind. Yeah. Yeah.
[1:26:07] That's the truth. That's what Brother
[1:26:08] Brandon taught us. But when you say it,
[1:26:12] Oh, he hears it. Yes.
[1:26:15] And it makes him mad. And I'm convinced
[1:26:17] that's why some people don't want to
[1:26:19] worship because they're afraid if they
[1:26:20] say it, the devil will get mad. I want
[1:26:22] to make him mad. I'm okay with him being
[1:26:25] mad. He's toothless. Yeah. Weaponless.
[1:26:30] Stripped. Defeated. Yeah. Turned out of
[1:26:34] his own house. Doesn't even have the
[1:26:36] keys to his own house. I want to make
[1:26:38] that guy mad. I'm not worried about
[1:26:40] kicking that bum out of my house. I'm
[1:26:42] not worried about him leaving the
[1:26:43] church. I want him to leave the church.
[1:26:45] You say, "Well, he won't leave me
[1:26:46] alone." He's not going to leave you
[1:26:48] alone anyway.
[1:26:51] He He hates to hear you. Praise God. Why
[1:26:53] does he hate it so much? Because in
[1:26:55] heaven, you remember that's what he
[1:26:57] grew. He He got jealous of Yeah. He had
[1:27:00] pride in his heart. Yeah. And he got
[1:27:02] jealous of of Michael of of Christ
[1:27:06] receiving all the praise. Yeah. And so
[1:27:08] he begins to in that jealousy and his
[1:27:11] anger, he lifted himself up and he loves
[1:27:15] to receive worship just like God does.
[1:27:17] Yeah. And and you say, "Well, I I've
[1:27:19] never wor the devil." Well, every time
[1:27:21] you talk his language, you're worshiping
[1:27:22] him. Come on.
[1:27:25] Do you know that? Well, I'm not going to
[1:27:27] make it. The devil goes, "Woohoo!
[1:27:32] Right. Well, I I don't think I'll ever
[1:27:34] be healed." The devil says, "Keep it
[1:27:36] going.
[1:27:38] He just so happy.
[1:27:41] But every time you say, "I'm going to
[1:27:43] make it. I'm a child of God. I belong to
[1:27:46] God. I don't belong to the enemy. I
[1:27:48] belong to him. No matter what I feel
[1:27:49] like or anything else, I'm going to
[1:27:50] worship God." What happens to you? All
[1:27:52] of a sudden, the devil gets mad. The
[1:27:54] devil loves Brother said demons like to
[1:27:56] hang out in dead places. Like to hang
[1:27:59] out in morgs. Why? Because they're
[1:28:00] worshiping the devil. Giving him all the
[1:28:03] glory. Oh, it's this is so bad and
[1:28:05] that's so bad and that's so bad. Why
[1:28:06] don't we give God some of the glory?
[1:28:08] There's still a bride on the earth
[1:28:09] without spot or wrinkle. There's still a
[1:28:11] people that won't give up and won't turn
[1:28:13] back. There's still somebody that'll
[1:28:15] serve him with all of their hearts.
[1:28:18] Amen.
[1:28:20] The devil hates to hear that. But the B
[1:28:22] said, I was standing there trying to
[1:28:23] tell the people they must receive the
[1:28:24] Holy Ghost. And the devil had come in
[1:28:26] around the people saying, "Don't listen.
[1:28:28] Sit still."
[1:28:30] You don't think he still tries that? A
[1:28:33] prophet was standing in the pulpit
[1:28:34] telling the people, "This is how you
[1:28:35] receive the Holy Ghost. This is what
[1:28:36] it's for. During his Holy Ghost series,
[1:28:39] he this is what it was given for. This
[1:28:41] is how you receive it. How you know you
[1:28:43] have it. He said the devil was sitting
[1:28:45] there coming around the people saying,
[1:28:47] "Don't listen.
[1:28:49] Sit still."
[1:28:51] He said, "My sister said, "Bill, I was
[1:28:54] so happy while you were preaching. I
[1:28:56] felt like I could raise up and jump
[1:28:57] through the wall. If I had a dollar for
[1:29:00] every time I heard that, I'd be a rich
[1:29:01] man."
[1:29:04] Boy, brother Ben, while you were
[1:29:05] preaching, I just felt like shouting.
[1:29:08] Well, listen what brother Brandham said.
[1:29:09] He said, he said, "But he said, I felt
[1:29:12] like I could raise up, jump to the
[1:29:13] wall." I said, "Raise up and jump."
[1:29:18] And she said, "But when you went to
[1:29:19] doing that," now watch. Brother Brandham
[1:29:22] got excited. He said, "The people begin
[1:29:24] shouting, then I just felt like I was an
[1:29:27] old nothing."
[1:29:30] Yeah.
[1:29:32] the that's the devil. That's what he
[1:29:34] wants you to feel like. Well, if I raise
[1:29:37] my hand, people will know and people
[1:29:39] know I've done bad things or I've been
[1:29:41] and I've been in a bad place and I've
[1:29:43] been depressed or I've been discouraged
[1:29:44] or I've been You're not worshiping your
[1:29:47] discouragement. Come on. You're not
[1:29:49] worshiping your depression. In fact,
[1:29:52] you're you're claiming by you're
[1:29:53] confessing by God's spirit you don't
[1:29:55] have it anymore. The great high priest's
[1:29:57] going to take care of it. Yeah. He's
[1:30:00] already died for your sins and for your
[1:30:02] healing. And so what can you say? Glory
[1:30:04] to God. Glory to the lamb. I love you,
[1:30:07] Lord Jesus. And when you do, what is it?
[1:30:09] The fruit of your lips. Begin to combat
[1:30:11] the enemy. It's spiritual warfare. He
[1:30:14] said, look, he said that when when the
[1:30:16] people begin shouting, I felt like I was
[1:30:17] an old nothing. I said, that's the
[1:30:19] devil. That's Satan. When he come in to
[1:30:21] do that, I said, you should have raised
[1:30:22] up anyhow. We're priests of God making
[1:30:25] spiritual sacrifice. the fruits of our
[1:30:27] lips giving praise to his name.
[1:30:30] Again, brother Ram said the trouble
[1:30:32] today and I'm almost done. He said,
[1:30:33] "We've organized the church to death."
[1:30:36] He said, "We got organization instead of
[1:30:37] messiahite. We've got Russite,
[1:30:40] procelite,
[1:30:42] all other kinds of light. But we need
[1:30:44] Messiahite."
[1:30:46] Well, that's what we need church in this
[1:30:48] area and and all of our churches, not
[1:30:50] just our local church here, but all of
[1:30:52] our churches. We need Messiahite. Yeah.
[1:30:54] Yeah. Not proite, not Russelite, but we
[1:30:57] need Messiahite. He said the light of
[1:30:59] the Messiah. Now that is true. God
[1:31:01] called me Messiahs. God called us and we
[1:31:02] become kings and priests unto God like
[1:31:04] Jesus was God's high priest. We become a
[1:31:07] lesser priest. Jesus was God in fullness
[1:31:09] dwelt in him to shine forth the
[1:31:11] expression of God to the world. For God
[1:31:13] was in Christ reconciling the world to
[1:31:14] himself. He said, "And as God was in
[1:31:17] Christ reconciling the world to himself,
[1:31:18] God comes into his church and anoints
[1:31:20] him some messiah." He said the same
[1:31:23] things he did is in his church. The same
[1:31:26] power he had is in his church and his
[1:31:28] church becomes his dominion. And he is
[1:31:30] king over this dominion. And we are
[1:31:32] kings and priests offering spiritual
[1:31:34] sacrifices to God. The fruit of our lips
[1:31:36] giving praise to his name. Yeah.
[1:31:39] Hallelujah.
[1:31:41] Hallelujah. He has offered himself
[1:31:45] for us. All that we have left to offer
[1:31:49] is the fruit of our lips. Amen.
[1:31:53] Everything else is taken care of. See,
[1:31:55] the Bible says, "He hath made us kings
[1:31:58] and priests unto God and his father. To
[1:32:00] him be glory and dominion forever."
[1:32:02] Brother Brandham said, "He hath made
[1:32:03] us." Oh, there are certain truths we
[1:32:06] need to emphasize.
[1:32:08] This is one of them. He He hath made us.
[1:32:12] Salvation is his doing. Salvation is of
[1:32:15] the Lord all of grace. Yeah. He redeemed
[1:32:20] us for a purpose. He bought us for a
[1:32:23] purpose. We are kings, spiritual kings.
[1:32:27] He said, "Oh, we are going to be kings
[1:32:28] upon the earth with him when he sits on
[1:32:30] his throne." But now, we are spiritual
[1:32:32] kings and we reign over a spiritual
[1:32:34] kingdom right now.
[1:32:37] Think about it, church. Right now, right
[1:32:40] where you're sitting and how you feel.
[1:32:42] And even if you're in the whale's belly,
[1:32:43] you are a spiritual king.
[1:32:47] Hallelujah.
[1:32:48] You are a spiritual priest. Look, he
[1:32:52] said, he said, "Right now, we reign with
[1:32:54] Christ, having dominion over sin, the
[1:32:55] world, the flesh, and the devil, showing
[1:32:57] forth his praise and glory, showing
[1:32:59] forth himself. For it is Christ in us,
[1:33:01] willing and doing of his good pleasure.
[1:33:03] Yes indeed, even now we are seated in
[1:33:05] heavenly places in Christ Jesus. He has
[1:33:07] made us priests." He said, "Yes, priests
[1:33:09] unto him, offering the spiritual praise
[1:33:12] of sanctified lips."
[1:33:15] You realize what that means to him,
[1:33:17] church? He said, "I create the fruit of
[1:33:19] the lips." He came and died to create.
[1:33:23] Hallelujah.
[1:33:25] A people that can call him by his name
[1:33:28] and said, "I thank you, Jesus."
[1:33:31] Hallelujah.
[1:33:33] Hallelujah. He has made us priests.
[1:33:36] Listen, musicians, go ahead and come. He
[1:33:38] said, "Yes, priest unto him, offering
[1:33:40] the spiritual praise of sanctified lips,
[1:33:43] spending our lives as a sweet offering
[1:33:48] unto him, worshiping him in spirit and
[1:33:53] in truth." Listen how he describes the
[1:33:55] job of the priest, interceding and
[1:33:58] petitioning
[1:33:59] priests and kings unto our God. He said,
[1:34:04] "No wonder the world does not appeal to
[1:34:06] us." And we are a peculiar people,
[1:34:09] zealous unto good works. We have been
[1:34:12] recreated in him to be like children.
[1:34:16] Children like unto our father.
[1:34:19] Oh my.
[1:34:20] Can you imagine
[1:34:22] what God felt when Jonah began to
[1:34:26] worship?
[1:34:28] Can you imagine how he felt
[1:34:32] when Paul and Silas, he had two priests?
[1:34:36] Amen. And God said, "I'm going to create
[1:34:39] some praise." Yes.
[1:34:42] So to create praise, Brother Danny, he
[1:34:45] he allowed them to be persecuted.
[1:34:49] He allowed them to get thrown in prison.
[1:34:51] Yes.
[1:34:53] But he wanted some praise.
[1:34:57] Sometimes he allows healing to show his
[1:34:59] glory, to give him praise when we're
[1:35:02] healed. Sometimes he puts you in bondage
[1:35:04] in prison or allows you to go into
[1:35:06] prison cuz he wants you to praise
[1:35:10] in spite of the bondage.
[1:35:15] And Paul's sitting there and Silas
[1:35:17] sitting there and it gets to the darkest
[1:35:19] hour of the night.
[1:35:22] They can't sleep. Rats are running all
[1:35:25] over the place. There's sewage and
[1:35:27] everything else. The horrible condition,
[1:35:30] the little hole in the ground that they
[1:35:31] were put in.
[1:35:34] And they begin to
[1:35:37] these priests now.
[1:35:40] They come, they say, "Well, there
[1:35:41] there's nothing else we can do. We can't
[1:35:44] preach. There's no one here to hear us.
[1:35:48] We can't
[1:35:50] we can't offer a lamb,
[1:35:54] but one has been offered.
[1:35:58] We can't offer a goat or a turtle dove
[1:36:00] or a pigeon and we're priests. What can
[1:36:03] we do?
[1:36:05] After a while, maybe Silas looked at
[1:36:07] Paul. He said, "You know what? Our lips
[1:36:09] still work.
[1:36:14] Our hands are tied down. Come on. Our
[1:36:17] feet are in stalks, but our lips still
[1:36:20] work. Said they didn't gag us.
[1:36:25] Oh, the He left one thing undone, didn't
[1:36:28] he? Oh, if the devil would have known,
[1:36:30] he he'd have put a gag over their mouth
[1:36:32] because they could still offer a
[1:36:33] sacrifice of praise.
[1:36:38] So, they begin to sing about midnight.
[1:36:40] They begin to sing. We don't know what
[1:36:41] they sang, brother M said. Maybe it was
[1:36:43] glory to his name or something like
[1:36:44] that. and they begin to sing. And when
[1:36:46] they begin to sing, all of a sudden the
[1:36:49] the the shackles that they were wearing
[1:36:52] begin to fall off. See, the problem is
[1:36:54] we're waiting on the shackles to fall
[1:36:56] off so we can praise. And God said, "I'm
[1:36:58] going to create some praise in the
[1:37:00] prison. I'm going to create some praise
[1:37:02] while the shackles are still on. Are you
[1:37:04] hearing me tonight, church? I'm going to
[1:37:05] create some praise while you're still
[1:37:06] sick. I'm going to create some praise
[1:37:08] while your family is still out of the
[1:37:10] ark of safety. I'm going to create some
[1:37:12] praise. Why? You still don't have what
[1:37:13] you've asked for, but you're believing
[1:37:15] for it and you believe it'll happen.
[1:37:17] They were believing God was going to
[1:37:18] release them. So, what they do? They
[1:37:20] begin to worship. They couldn't raise
[1:37:22] their hand. They couldn't stomp their
[1:37:23] feet. So, they did the only thing they
[1:37:25] could do. And they begin to lift up
[1:37:26] their voice.
[1:37:28] And that was the very sacrifice that God
[1:37:30] wanted. And when they lifted their
[1:37:33] voice, he shushed the angels.
[1:37:37] those beings that were created to praise
[1:37:39] him. He said, "I want to hear this
[1:37:41] worship. I'm ready to hear this kind of
[1:37:44] praise
[1:37:45] because this is the ones
[1:37:48] who are going to offer their sacrifice.
[1:37:50] No matter what the devil does to them,
[1:37:52] no matter what, he does his very worst.
[1:37:56] And all it does is create praise on the
[1:37:59] lips of Paul and Silas." I say, "God,
[1:38:02] help us today. You may find yourself in
[1:38:04] a similar condition, but he's still
[1:38:06] worthy of your praise.
[1:38:10] My praise, the fruit of our lips.
[1:38:14] We can praise him with our hands, and
[1:38:15] that's wonderful. The Bible says to do
[1:38:17] that. We can praise him with our feet.
[1:38:20] That's wonderful. We can praise him by
[1:38:22] going to church, by paying our tithe, by
[1:38:23] doing what's right. We can praise him in
[1:38:25] that way. But he said he wants the fruit
[1:38:27] of your lips. That's the sacrifice. He
[1:38:30] wants to hear you praise him. I know
[1:38:33] sometimes we're not outspoken, but it's
[1:38:34] just more of a sacrifice.
[1:38:37] It's just more of a sacrifice. But it's
[1:38:39] something we have to do because
[1:38:41] sometimes maybe nobody else will hear
[1:38:42] it, but you need to hear yourself hear
[1:38:44] it. You need to hear yourself in the
[1:38:46] house of God in the worst moment of your
[1:38:48] life. Begin to call out to him and say,
[1:38:49] "Lord, I know you're good. I know you're
[1:38:52] still the same yesterday, today, and
[1:38:53] forever." Then your body begins to obey
[1:38:55] your testimony and things begin to
[1:38:57] change. Shackles begin to fall off.
[1:38:59] Isn't that what we want tonight? Isn't
[1:39:01] that what we want? We want to be free,
[1:39:03] then we ought to begin to praise God. We
[1:39:06] want to be unbound, we ought to begin to
[1:39:07] praise God. We want to have victory, we
[1:39:10] ought to begin to praise God right now
[1:39:11] in the circumstance that we're in and
[1:39:14] begin to praise God and he'll bring the
[1:39:16] victory. Heavenly Father, Lord, we love
[1:39:18] you tonight and we thank you, Lord. I
[1:39:21] just
[1:39:23] in in in studying these things. I just
[1:39:24] feel like Lord maybe myself
[1:39:27] I've not been diligent in some ways Lord
[1:39:30] in worshiping you in the good or the bad
[1:39:33] or sometimes I get discouraged after
[1:39:35] preaching and I get done and I think
[1:39:37] what am I doing? I don't know why I'm
[1:39:39] still preaching but Lord it's in that
[1:39:41] moment that you want to hear the fruit
[1:39:42] of my lips giving praise to God. I pray
[1:39:46] God that you'll help me do it, Lord. In
[1:39:49] the moment when we're most discouraged
[1:39:50] and in the moment when the devil tries
[1:39:52] to tell us we're nothing. In the moment
[1:39:54] when he tries to tell us to be silent,
[1:39:56] Lord, maybe at that moment is the very
[1:39:58] moment when you want to hear a sacrifice
[1:40:01] of praise. I pray you'd grant it
[1:40:02] tonight. Lord, open up my lips. Oh God,
[1:40:05] help me to speak the things that need to
[1:40:07] be said. Help me to confess, Lord, to
[1:40:10] the great high priest. for you are
[1:40:12] touched by the feeling of my infirmity,
[1:40:14] by the infirmities of the people. We
[1:40:17] thank you for that, Lord. I pray you'd
[1:40:19] help us tonight. Lord, if there's one
[1:40:21] here in need, I pray you'd meet their
[1:40:23] need tonight. I pray, Lord, you'd heal
[1:40:25] the sick and Lord, help those that are
[1:40:27] discouraged. Oh God, I pray you'd bring
[1:40:29] encouragement to them, Lord. Those that
[1:40:31] need revelation in their life. Give them
[1:40:33] revelation what to do and Lord, and
[1:40:35] things what they what how how they
[1:40:37] should live. But oh God for all of us
[1:40:39] Lord bring a sacrifice of praise from
[1:40:41] our lips. Help us to know that you are
[1:40:44] God and to speak it. Lord we pray in
[1:40:48] Jesus name. Amen. Thank you Lord Jesus.
[1:40:54] Hallelujah.
[1:40:55] I wonder if we can just stand together.
[1:40:59] Oh I feel his presence here again
[1:41:00] tonight.
[1:41:02] If you have the need the altar's open
[1:41:04] but I'd be glad to pray with you but Why
[1:41:07] don't we just worship him with all of
[1:41:08] our hearts? We're here. We're here.
[1:41:12] We're not often all gathered together.
[1:41:14] But those of us who are here tonight,
[1:41:16] while we're here, we just lift our hands
[1:41:18] to begin to worship him. Lord, I love
[1:41:20] you
[1:41:22] today. Maybe for the first time in a
[1:41:24] long time, you're going to hear that
[1:41:26] you're a good God. You're going to hear
[1:41:28] that I love you and that that I worship
[1:41:31] your name. I glorify your name. You're
[1:41:34] worthy to be praised. Today we are
[1:41:36] lesser priests bringing a sacrifice of
[1:41:39] praise to the great high priest. Oh,
[1:41:41] thank you Lord Jesus. Together wonderful
[1:41:46] to me.
[1:41:49] Hallelujah.
[1:41:51] Oh light of the world. You step down
[1:41:56] into darkness. Oh, open my eyes. I'm so
[1:42:01] glad you did, Lord. Let me see.
[1:42:05] All your beauty that makes all this
[1:42:09] heart adore you. It's the hope of a life
[1:42:16] spend with you.
[1:42:18] Hallelujah.
[1:42:20] Hallelujah. Oh yes. Here I am to
[1:42:24] worship. Oh, I'm here Lord. I just want
[1:42:27] to worship you from the belly of this
[1:42:29] bail. Oh God, from the bottom of the of
[1:42:31] the ocean. Oh God, from the darkest
[1:42:34] moment of a life, Lord, I'm still going
[1:42:36] to praise you. I'm still going to
[1:42:37] worship you. Oh God, I'm still going to
[1:42:39] lift my hands. I won't do what I can,
[1:42:42] Lord. I'm going to offer my sacrifice of
[1:42:44] praise. Oh, thank you, Lord Jesus. I
[1:42:47] love you. You're worthy, oh God.
[1:42:50] Hallelujah.
[1:42:52] Oh, King of all day. So, so highly
[1:42:58] exalted.
[1:43:00] You are glorious in heaven and above.
[1:43:07] Oh yes, humbly you came to the earth.
[1:43:12] That's all right. Come on. Break
[1:43:13] through. Talk to him for a minute. Let
[1:43:16] him hear you. Let him know that you're
[1:43:17] here with him. That that he's worthy of
[1:43:20] your praise even on a Wednesday night.
[1:43:22] Oh, thank you, Lord. Oh, and here I am.
[1:43:25] I am one to worship. I didn't come for
[1:43:28] no purpose to this service. Here tonight
[1:43:31] as a priest of God after the order of
[1:43:34] Melzdc bringing a spiritual sacrifice.
[1:43:38] Oh, you're all together love.
[1:43:42] Oh, all together worthy.
[1:43:46] Oh, you're all together
[1:43:49] wonderful
[1:43:51] to me.
[1:43:54] Oh, I will never know
[1:43:59] how much it cost
[1:44:03] to see my sin
[1:44:06] upon
[1:44:08] that cross.
[1:44:10] I'll never know
[1:44:13] how much it cost
[1:44:17] to see my sins upon the cross.
[1:44:24] Sing it now. Oh, here I am to worship.
[1:44:30] Oh, here I am.
[1:44:34] Here I am to say
[1:44:37] that you're my God.

[1:45:22] to me.
[1:45:26] Hallelujah. Let's just lift our hands
[1:45:27] today.
[1:45:29] Lord, we're going to take this moment of
[1:45:30] opportunity to speak to you and tell you
[1:45:33] how wonderful you are, how lovely you
[1:45:36] are, Lord.
[1:45:39] You've forgiven me so many times, Lord
[1:45:41] Jesus.
[1:45:43] You've loved me so much, oh God.
[1:45:45] What could I give you back? How could I
[1:45:48] ever repay you for salvation?
[1:45:51] How could I repay you for the work of
[1:45:53] the Holy Ghost in my life? How could I
[1:45:56] ever repay you for your work here in
[1:45:58] this church, Lord? For your presence
[1:45:59] here among us, Lord, I could never do
[1:46:02] it, but I'm going to pay my vows right
[1:46:04] here in this place. Lord, I love you.
[1:46:07] I'm not ashamed of you. I I worship you
[1:46:10] with all of my heart, with all my
[1:46:11] breath, with all my strength. Oh God, I
[1:46:14] love you with all my heart. I thank you,
[1:46:17] Lord Jesus.
[1:46:19] Hallelujah.

[1:46:32] man. Oh, you're worthy of it all.
[1:46:38] Hallelujah.
[1:46:40] Oh, for from you are all things.
