I uh mentioned last week, Brother Bill Whiteamp is retiring from being a trustee. And brother Bill, I got you something. I just wanted to give that to you. Come on up, brother Bill, if you would. We sure appreciate Brother Bill. and I know he's made a sacrifice to serve over the years and thankful for the other brothers that have stepped up. God bless you, brother Bill.

I believe he's able to meet that need. Let's stand together once again. It's hard to have you up and down, but let's just approach him in prayer this morning. If you have a need, would you slip it up to him by way of uplifted hand? God sees every need. He knows every heart. Heavenly Father, we're so grateful to be your children today. Lord, you are awesome. You are all powerful. There's nothing that you can't do. Lord, if we can just stay in our position and watch you do what you do. Lord, I pray you'd grant it this morning. Help us to do that. Help us to believe, Lord, for what we have need of, God. I don't know what these needs are represented by uplifted hand, but you do. And I pray, God, that you'd meet those needs. Touch every heart. Lord, my heart this morning is in need of a touch. Lord, as we go through the week, many times we we we we gain, Lord, a little bit of separation, it seems like between us and and you. We don't want that, Lord. We we want to be just right up close to you. We want to be right with there with you. You said you'd never leave us, never forsake us. So, Lord, we want to stay right with your word, right with your spirit. I pray you'd grant it, Lord. Bless these people, heal the sick, touch everyone. We pray in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you this morning. Turn with me to John chapter 5. The book of John chapter 5. I want to talk to you this morning about something that kind of keyed off of something we talked about on Wednesday night. We preached on the God that was rich in mercy. God had made a provision. One of the things that God made a provision for healing. One of the ways that he made provision was the pool of Bethesda. That story is told in John chapter 5. John 5:1 says, "After this, there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. There is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches. In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, a blind halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water. For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water. Whosoever then first, after the troubling of the water, stepped in, was made a whole of whatsoever disease he had. And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity, 30 and 8 years. When Jesus saw him lie and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he saith unto him, "Wilt thou be made whole?" In other words, do do you want revival? Do do you want to be whole? You want to be well? I want to use that as my text this morning. Do you want revival? God bless you. You can be seated. The story tells us of a man who who laid there. I don't know if he laid there the whole 38 years, but he might have by a pool of disappointment. Every time he got up to go to the pool, somebody bigger, stronger, faster got there ahead of him. &gt;&gt; He was unable to to alleviate his condition. Whatever it was wasn't wasn't mortal. It wasn't fatal, but he he just continued with it. He just couldn't get rid of it. And he he couldn't go about his normal life. and he just couldn't seem to get his healing. So, he was just continuing by the pool of Bethesda. That condition he waited for revival. The pool of Bethesda was a a pool that they had made where there was a spring and there it was a great pool in places. It was 40 foot deep. You can actually go visit it in Jerusalem today. It had five porches alongside of it. the they were covered roofs to cover the people as they would lay there waiting on the moving of the water and and there was maybe a thousand people under each porch. It was very very many people that waited and and so you can imagine in in the crush of the crowd to get down to the water. You had to be first. So you had to I don't know what they did to to get near the water, but I'm sure people paid for it. People begged, borrowed, stole, whatever they had to do to try to get near the water for a chance. And they didn't know when the water would be troubled, but they waited on it. They waited on it to happen. I want to ask you a question this morning. Why did the man lay by the pool of Bethesda when Jesus was already in the land? Why did he lay there? it. You know, it's either because he didn't know or didn't recognize that Jesus was the answer to his problem. &gt;&gt; Jesus was the revival that he needed. &gt;&gt; It don't get any deeper than this this morning, church. So, just hang with me. But Jesus was actually the one that he needed to pass by his way. &gt;&gt; But he didn't go to the meeting where Jesus was. He understood he waited by the pool and he must not have recognized the presence of the word among the people or he would have actually gone to him and asked him to heal him. Brother Brandham says this. He said, "Oh, the greatest pleasure I know of is to pray until I can realize that I'm in the presence of God and recognize it. Recognize it." So to be able in that moment when you know you've broken through in that moment when you know that he's with you in that moment when you know that that that there's something in the service there's a presence there with you maybe by your hospital bed maybe maybe when you're worried about things when you struggling in your life and it's in that moment you realize there's somebody else there you're not alone. Have you ever felt like that and to be able to recognize that it's him that does it. It's him that's there to recognize his presence. He said, "I think that ought to be the thrill of the church &gt;&gt; is the presence of the Holy Spirit." &gt;&gt; Oh, I think we've been seeking our thrills too cheaply. &gt;&gt; As CS Lewis said, he said, "We're like little children playing in the mud, and we don't recognize the importance of of getting away and going on vacation." He said, "Because children are just happy playing with the mud, like the person who who took the wrapping paper and threw away the gift." We we don't recognize it's not that our desires are too strong for things of the world, but our desire is too weak for the things of God. &gt;&gt; We don't really recognize how much we need his presence. &gt;&gt; He didn't recognize his presence among him among them or he would have went looking for him. &gt;&gt; But we know he said that's the thrill of the church is the presence of the Holy Spirit. See the God that made the promise standing among us. Feel his presence. See his word. See it vindicated. He said it ought to give faith to make cripples walk and and blind see and deaf hear and dumb speak. Don't you realize that's what brother Brandham's ministry was? He said my ministry is to declare that he is here. &gt;&gt; That the God of the heavens is on the earth again. That he's not dead in a tomb. He's not in Jerusalem. He's not dead. He's not he's not he's not didn't stay there. It's not an Eastern religion. It's not a religion of 2,000 years ago. But the God of today, the same God who walked the shores of Galilee is right here this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. Something had changed, &gt;&gt; but the man didn't recognize it. Now, if you suppose that the man had laid there ever since he had gotten sick, maybe he was 60 years old and at 22 he come down with this disease and he laid there and and he went he knew this was a place where healing was &gt;&gt; and so he was in that condition waiting on a revival. And I don't know how many times that I've talked to people and they said, "Brother Ben, we're just waiting on revival." waiting on revival in the church. Waiting on revival in our home. Waiting on revival in our marriage. Come on, church. We're just waiting on a revival. And the thing is, the reason he was waiting is because he didn't recognize the revival that was already there. Brother Brandham said the reason they were crying out for a revival in his time. Listen, brother Brandham was on the earth &gt;&gt; and they were crying out and saying, "We need a prophet in our time. Come on. &gt;&gt; We need a prophet to return. He said they failed to recognize the awakening of the bride. &gt;&gt; They failed to recognize it. So this man while he lay there failed by the trip to recognize that Christ was already among the people. That he was already healing the sick. He was already begun his ministry. He wasn't just a baby in a manger. The word had been born, but the word had also come to maturity during the time that he laid there. Think about that for a moment. He had during the time he had been sick. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Oh, God. God had actually been born in flesh. &gt;&gt; Emmanuel, God with us. &gt;&gt; And during the Oh, come on. While you were waiting on revival, revival was already there. While you were waiting on healing, healing was already there. It's right there by you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He was waiting on a moving of the waters, right? on a revival in the area that he was in. Waiting on a revival in the church &gt;&gt; that he was in. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And and there's a certain amount of that that becomes an excuse because &gt;&gt; it's like, well, I'm sick, but everybody else is sick, too. Or I'm And there's nothing no there's no shame in being sick, but we know a healer, &gt;&gt; right? We we believe we are healed. Do you believe that today? &gt;&gt; But many times we wait on something to happen. Just waiting on a move of the spirit so that God can begin. You know, that's what they did in Pentecost. They waited on the Holy Spirit. They tried. Brother Brandham taught us we don't have to tarry anymore. &gt;&gt; They tried in the upper room, but we don't have to tar anymore. &gt;&gt; You young people stay with me. I know some of y'all were had a busy day yesterday, but just stay with me now. You know, you're we're waiting many times on camp to come. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. And we believe in sending our kids to camp. We want them to associate with Christians. &gt;&gt; We want them to have a revival. We want them to be in that atmosphere. &gt;&gt; Listen, but but the revival is right here, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; The the the word has been manifested by you. &gt;&gt; And the manifested word has been identified as the lamb. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. the fullness of the atonement. So, Brother Brandham taught us as we were talking about God rich in mercy. He taught us that the God who was rich in mercy, he said provided a a brass serpent, you remember, and they could look and live. He also provided a pool of Bethesda, they could wait there for the moving of the water, it was God rich in mercy. He said when they made an idol out of the brass serpent, he provided another way for them. &gt;&gt; But don't you realize that we're not just waiting on that to happen because something changed when Jesus came? You realize once Jesus stepped onto the scene and begun his ministry, that pool never moved again. &gt;&gt; There's no record in history that the angel ever troubled the water again because the angel that troubled the water had come in flesh. &gt;&gt; Right? The brass serpent or the pole, sin was judged in his body. &gt;&gt; So the fullness had come and it had been identified by John in John chapter 1 and verse 29. And it says, "The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him and saith, Behold who?" The lamb. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The lamb. &gt;&gt; The the those five porches that were there, the pool of Bethesda, they were surrounding that pool, but the way you got to it was through the sheep gate. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Remember the scripture said it was by the sheep market. &gt;&gt; That's where they brought the lambs in &gt;&gt; to be offered for a sacrifice. And the lamb walked through the sheep gate. the atonement for healing and for salvation come through the gate. Hallelujah. And John said, "Behold the lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world." &gt;&gt; He's not a temporary lamb. He's not a lamb when you feel good. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. He's not a lamb when you're well. But he's a lamb when you're sick. He's a lamb when you're in trouble. He's a lamb when you don't have any money. He's a lamb when you're not doing good. Come on, church. He's still the lamb. How many believe he's the lamb today? He is the perfect atonement. &gt;&gt; Oh, do you want revival this morning? He is our revival. &gt;&gt; Our revival is the fullness of the word manifested. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; He said, "This is he of whom I said, after me cometh the man which is preferred before me, for he was before me." Yeah. &gt;&gt; Again, the next day after John stood in two of his disciples and looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, "Behold the lamb of God." He didn't quit saying it. &gt;&gt; He just kept telling them, "This is him." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; This is him. You see, things had changed while he was laying there. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Jesus began his ministry at a wedding ceremony in John chapter 2. He talked about a wedding ceremony. And it's kind of an odd place to begin his ministry. He turned water into wine. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; What was it? Brought stimulation of revelation. &gt;&gt; The word had come. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; To to to attend a wedding. &gt;&gt; I believe there's been a wedding going on. &gt;&gt; The said we don't go to the w to the wedding. We go to the wedding supper. &gt;&gt; There's been a wedding going on. And so the word had come a and come to the wedding and the water was turned into wine and there was a stimulation of revelation and everybody was still sitting by the pool waiting on the angel to trouble the waters and the water's already been turned into wine. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. It was it was in John, the book of John, I believe it's in chapter 3 where Nicodemus came by night and was told you must be born again. &gt;&gt; What was it? The lamb was present. the full word. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You don't have to remain the way that you are. Listen to me. You don't have to remain that way. I I know sometimes we we have this up and down relationship with the Lord and and we're in one day and out the next. And I know all of us struggle. We all live in a body of humiliation. We all live in flesh. But we can be an overcomer. &gt;&gt; We don't have to live the way that they lived even in denominational ages. Why does God call us to a a closer walk with him and a higher call of holiness here at the end time? Because the fullness of the word, the lamb has come to enable us to walk like that. Listen, Luther couldn't have walked like you walked. Wesley couldn't have walked. Though he had sanctification, but he couldn't have walked like you walked. But you can walk pleasing to the Lord, not because of your own effort, not because of legalism, but because the full lamb is coming to the picture. &gt;&gt; The fullness of the word is. Do you realize what the message of the hour is to us? It's not just a man's words, but it's the fullness of the atonement. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And when the fullness is there, you don't have to keep the consciousness of sin. &gt;&gt; You don't have to keep the desire of the sin. That was the difference between the partial atonement and the full atonement. Under a partial atonement, you had to come back year by year and you could not be cleansed from the sin conscience. You couldn't be cleansed. Go read Hebrews. He said, he said it could not make the comer there and too perfect. But there come a lamb. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That could make somebody perfect. Maybe not in the eyes of man, but perfect in the eyes of God. &gt;&gt; You don't have to be up and down and in and out. And today you're a Christian and tomorrow you're not. And today you're doing good. And tomorrow you don't know if the word's right or not. Today you believe the message. Tomorrow you don't know if you believe the message or not. You can stay inside the Holy of Holies. The veil has been rent and the mercy seat has come into plain view. This is the fullness of the atonement. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The lamb is present walking right among us. &gt;&gt; Oh, come on, church. We can be made whole. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's struggling with something sinful in your life and you can be made whole. You don't have to remain like that. You can be made whole. You can feel the presence of God. Brother said, "A man that believes God can feel God, know God, know that he's there by faith, you know he's there, but you can actually feel him and know him. You can know him in a real way because the lamb has come in our day." John chapter 3 and 26. They came to John and said to him, "Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou beest witness, behold the same baptizest, all men come to him." And John answered and said, "A man can receive nothing except to be given him from heaven. You yourselves bear me witness that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him. He that hath the bride is the bridegroom, but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and hearth him rejoicth greatly, because of the bridegroom's voice." &gt;&gt; This my joy therefore is fulfilled. He said, "He must increase, but I must decrease." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The brand said, "John the Baptist come on as a sign." He was a prophet. He was a prophet. Sign come on the earth. They knew when he'd come on the Messiah would speak after him. It had to be cuz get the elected. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; All right. So, there had to be a sign and then a voice calling the elect after the sign. &gt;&gt; Yeah. He said John calling out the elected and give it over to Christ when he come swapped his his church. I love that. Swapped his church and become Christ's church. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Said I must decrease. He must increase because he said I'm just the voice of him crying in the wilderness, prepare the way for the Lord. &gt;&gt; And Jesus come the same way. He said gets the elected ready to hear the voice of God. He said that's what the prophetic sign is. Yes. &gt;&gt; That's why John came. John was a sign to the world that here come the messenger preparing then there must be a Messiah after him. &gt;&gt; Are you with me so far? &gt;&gt; So he said if if you follow these messages he said get the elected ready. He said not the others will never hear it. It's the elected that's called. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Again he said 400 years Israel without a prophet. The churches have got so twisted up. And then here come John on the scene. John was the prophet. a sign that the Messiah was going to speak after him. He said, "Watch." Because Malachi 3 said, "I'll send my messenger before my face to prepare the way, prepare the people." Look at John. No selfishness in him. He never took any glory. They tried to call him the Messiah. But he said, "I'm not worthy to loose his shoes." But as soon as Jesus appeared, he had a sign, a pillar of fire, a light above him like a dove come down, a voice saying, "This is my beloved son in whom I'm well pleased." Notice in John immediately said, "He must increase, I must decrease." He presented the church to Christ. &gt;&gt; He said, "We are told in the last days that will repeat again." There's going to be a message come forth. I believe we have it today. Aren't you glad for the message of the hour? There's going to be a message come forth that'll introduce the Messiah to the people and it'll be in such a way they'll stand dumbfounded like they did then. He said he promised it. &gt;&gt; Oh, church, do we recognize where we're living? &gt;&gt; Do we recognize what day and what hour we're living in? Oh my &gt;&gt; look here was the fullness of the word. The one who said, "I am the God &gt;&gt; that healeth thee, &gt;&gt; put shoes on, &gt;&gt; had a robe on, &gt;&gt; like any other man, &gt;&gt; a staff in his hand, &gt;&gt; like any other man. Come walking like any other man. He looked like just another man." Brother said, "He didn't look like a leader. He looked just like a normal man." and he come walking towards that pool of Bethesda, the one who said, "I am the God &gt;&gt; that heal thee." We're not talking about a second person or a third person. He is the person. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. No wonder it was such a He said it's an easy thing to say you're healed. He said, but also to say your sins are forgiven. &gt;&gt; Right? He was the atonement. He was the lamb that takes away the sin of the world. And and if he the man could have only recognized who he was, he'd have come to him. But I'm so glad that when we don't recognize him, he still knows us. &gt;&gt; Oh, come on, church. When we fail to find him, he's still looking for us. We weren't looking for him. Brother Stewart, he came looking for me. &gt;&gt; And God with shoes on. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; God with dust on his clothes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Came down in the midst of all that mess. All those people who were there crying out for healing and come to the elected and said, "Do you want a revival? Do you want to be well? Here I am." &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Do we recognize where we're living? See, what had happened was the bridegroom revival was in the land. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. But a prophet declared that the bride revival is in the land. &gt;&gt; The awakening of the bride. He even said an infant bride was on the earth. I believe today we see the bride being manifested. And what are we talking about? We're talking about a word in its fullness. &gt;&gt; So today though, what do people do? They still gather around pools, &gt;&gt; right? Which is a place where you store up water. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; To keep it from getting away. And so they make up doctrinal pools. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And gather around them. And they each one have a pool and one calls it this doctrine or that doctrine that I won't name doctrines because if I got started I'd never stop and people believe anything. &gt;&gt; I heard one time there was a group of people I think our brother brother Ivy mentioned it one time and I went and looked it up. There's actually a tribe that worshiped snails. &gt;&gt; If you can worship a snail, you can worship anything. &gt;&gt; Just cuz you made it up don't make it real. Right. &gt;&gt; Just cuz you believe it don't make it right. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; But the fullness of the word is coming our day. &gt;&gt; But people had their pools. They had their little pools they built and and their little ideas and their their conception of who Christ was and what what he did and and all of these things. They had their pool, the pool of Bethesda. and and and they were there waiting on a revival, not realizing that the revival was over the sweeping revival. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. The angel would never trouble the water again. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Because the angel had come, the fullness had come to be the healer, to be the revival. And and that challenges us as individuals &gt;&gt; because look, we can't get distracted by denominational pools, &gt;&gt; educational pools, &gt;&gt; philosophical pools, &gt;&gt; podcasts, &gt;&gt; entertainment, &gt;&gt; Hollywood, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Now, look, I'm not preaching against those things. I'm saying don't be distracted by them. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Fox News or CNN or Democrats or Republicans and everybody's all in an uproar about all these things. Don't get distracted. Get to looking at your pool. Remember, the full word is right here among us, &gt;&gt; what are those things? They're false revivals. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. False revivals offering a glimmer of wholeness. &gt;&gt; If you'll do this, you can be made whole. If you'll jump through these hoops and believe this doctrine, you can be made whole. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; If you'll go to this church, you can be made whole. Listen, it's it's a denominational pool. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? You don't have to go to this church to be made a whole. &gt;&gt; What you got to do is recognize who's standing by you. &gt;&gt; You don't have to live in Hardy, Arkansas to be made whole. You don't have to say, you don't have to know who Ben Puit is to be made whole. You don't have to know who Donnie Reagan is or Tim Pru or anybody else or Brother Joel or Brother Stewart. You got to know him. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. You got to know him. And the only way you can know him in his fullness is by the word of the hour. &gt;&gt; False revival offering a glimmer of wholeness like a carrot on a stick. &gt;&gt; But no matter how many videos you look at, it'll never give full satisfaction. &gt;&gt; Hear me today. No matter how many &gt;&gt; relationships you pursue, &gt;&gt; it'll never give full satisfaction. &gt;&gt; Right. No, no matter how much good food you have or bad food, it'll never give full satisfaction. No matter how much you entertain yourself, you know, I I'm a human being, too. I like entertaining things. I like being entertained. All of us do. But we don't come to church to be entertained. &gt;&gt; We come for a visit with the word who we know is already here. Yes, &gt;&gt; we come with a for a visit with him. &gt;&gt; And so when we come, there's nothing that entertains my soul like his presence. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Like being in his presence. And I wonder if there's a desire there. If there's something in your heart, I'm taking my time this morning, but I really want to get this across to you. If there's something in your heart that says, "Lord, I just need you. I just want you to be here. I got a desire in my heart. I want to be well. I want to be whole. I want to have that satisfaction that only you can provide." Listen church. You say, "Well, I have the Holy Ghost." Yes, but you need filling after refilling after refilling. I need refilling. A refilling of the Holy Ghost. Every one of us do. Why do we come back to the house of God? We want to be refilled. We want to be ready. We want to be We want to be somebody he can work through. We want to be somebody he can speak through. And so, what do we do? We don't go to a pool, a disappointing pool. We don't go to a denomination. We go to the word. And the word is our source of information. The word is our source of entertainment. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When we believe the word in his fullness, his presence comes. &gt;&gt; A woman at the well had been given water. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And she would never thirst again. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; I hope you hear me this morning. I believe the Lord is speaking to somebody this morning. I know he's speaking to my heart. &gt;&gt; That's the water that I want. That's the water the man needed. But he didn't recognize Jesus was in the land. &gt;&gt; But Jesus had a need to go by Samaria cuz she didn't recognize it either until he showed her the sign of the Messiah. &gt;&gt; Revealed the secret of her heart. Then she knew this must be the one. Hallelujah. This is the prophet. This is the Messiah. This was the word revival. It was the word himself bringing. See, people think that the word revival is the a revival without emotion. That's not what it is at all. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; A word revival is not a revival without emotion. A word revival is a revival of him. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Who is the word, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Right. It's Christ moving among us. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; However he wants to move. However, if he wants to speak to us in the quietness of the word, if he wants to pour out his blessings on us, if he wants uh to if we want to shout or run or speak into whatever it is that he calls us to do, it won't be out of order if he's the one that inspires it. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? And so, the word has got to come. That's what we want. We don't want just a dead letter, but we want the word. The word didn't come in dead letter. But Jesus didn't just didn't stand there and speak. He moved. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. &gt;&gt; He He spoke. He moved. He touched. &gt;&gt; He healed. &gt;&gt; He traveled. This word travels. &gt;&gt; It don't ain't just good at church. Come on. It ain't just good at your home. It's good at your work. It's good everywhere. It'll keep your testimony. &gt;&gt; The bride revival is not just a revival of a moment. It's not a revival of a service. It's not a revival of a meeting, but it's a revival of the word. &gt;&gt; Good. Oh, I call it out to you today. Why don't we leave our pools of disappointment &gt;&gt; trying to figure everything out? We want to have it all figured out and then we'll come to him. No, leave that old pool of education. &gt;&gt; Come to the word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Leave your pools of disappointment and hear the voice of the word crying out, "Do you want revival? Get up and walk. Hallelujah. You might get prayed for. Brother Brandon said that uh the Congressman Upshaw, he said he'd had gallons of oil poured on his head &gt;&gt; because of all the different brothers that had prayed for him. There's nothing wrong with that. &gt;&gt; But see, it had to come his time. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; God, the revelation of the word was there. And brother Brandon by a vision saw him walking. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And when he saw him walking, then all brother Upshaw had to do, all Congressman Upshaw had to do was obey the word. &gt;&gt; I hope you're hearing me today. Listen, you don't need some kind of weird sensation or something. All you need to do is obey the word. You need to do what the word says do. If the word says get up and walk, it's time to get up and walk. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? Now, so John 5 and6 tells us says when Jesus saw him lie and knew, how did he know the same God that spoke through a prophet in our day and said, "Your name is Miss Brown. You're sitting on the edge of your seat. Go home. You'll be you'll be healed of your sinus trouble." That little lady lived in West Plains. Told me her story. I know I've mentioned her many times, but there were many in this area that that that experienced that that a man that did not know them, they'd never met. They never put their name on a prayer card. But William Brandham stood there. Wasn't brother Brandham, but it was God speaking through a man. It was God borrowing a redeemed body to speak and tell us something. What was he telling us? I'm still God. I'm still the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; Jesus knew. Yes. &gt;&gt; Oh, don't you know he knows your situation. &gt;&gt; He knows what you're going through. He knows what you're crying about. He knows what you young people are suffering. He knows the the things that are in your heart that you're holding. You might as well surrender it to him. You might as well give it all up to him. Let him have it this morning. He already knows. &gt;&gt; He said he knew he'd been a long time &gt;&gt; in that case. And he said to him, "Wilt thou be made whole?" &gt;&gt; That's an odd question to ask, isn't it? Look how the man answers. The impotent man. I I love the way the Bible puts that. The man who had no ability to help himself, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That was me. &gt;&gt; The man who had no ability &gt;&gt; to help himself, the impotent man answered, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. You can try to pull yourself up by your bootstraps all your life, but you're in the end when it comes to spiritual things, we're just impotent. We're not able. &gt;&gt; But he said, "Sir, I have no man." Now, watch what he's waiting for. He had seen perhaps in that time, you know, somebody go down and help their friend &gt;&gt; make it down to the water quickly. He'd seen evangelists come through, right, and hold a healing revival and people get healed. He'd seen service after service where a man helped somebody. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; So, what does he say? I have no man. &gt;&gt; I I would love to get down, but I have no man. &gt;&gt; Oh, I hope you get it this morning, church. I I would love to have a revival, but I'm waiting on the preacher. &gt;&gt; I'd love to have revival. I'd love to be on fire for God. Boy, I love it when it always amazes me people that just love to see the church on fire and never get on fire themselves. &gt;&gt; Preach. &gt;&gt; I It's not enough. I don't want to be I've never been a person that just like to watch something. I want to participate in it. &gt;&gt; Oh, I don't want to just watch the church have revival. I don't want to just watch the young people have revival. Let the revival begin in me. Yes. &gt;&gt; He said, "I have no man." &gt;&gt; No man. What he didn't realize is that the age of men carrying you to a re revival is over. &gt;&gt; Hear me, church. The age of a man. Listen, I can't preach you into revival. The revival is already here. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The age of man is over. The age of the word, &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; is here. &gt;&gt; And the word is asking the question this morning, wilt thou be made whole? Do you want to be well? &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; It seems silly. And I've been in here for 38 years. You don't think I want to be well? You know, the man could have got offended, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Haven't you seen me at church? &gt;&gt; Haven't you seen me at the altar? &gt;&gt; But it's a good question. &gt;&gt; Jesus knows the right questions to ask. &gt;&gt; Do you want to be well? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Every one of us individually has got to answer that. Do you want revival? &gt;&gt; Cuz all of us need it &gt;&gt; from time to time. We need revival. &gt;&gt; You see, Jesus knew how long he had been there. &gt;&gt; So, he knew he'd been there. Maybe all 38 years. We don't know. But he'd been there a long time. Maybe he got used to it. &gt;&gt; He laid there and he just got used to the routine of seeing other people blessed. and brother so and so got blessed and sister so and so got blessed and the kids had a good time at camp and and this church had a great revival and I streamed the service and that church did that and this one did that and back in brother Brandham's time people got healed but the word is speaking to you this morning and speaking to me do you want a revival do you want your family to be in revival do you want your home to have the token applied to it it's here for you if you want it to be &gt;&gt; do you want to be well &gt;&gt; come Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Jesus knew that over time our conditions become a routine. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; There's a something this is a little bit too knowledgeable for me. But how many of you know what the second law of thermodynamics is? There's somebody. The second law of thermodynamics. I didn't know either till I read it. But the second law of thermodynamics is is basically that there's this layman's terms, but there's no perpetual motion machine, &gt;&gt; right? Anything that's going will eventually stop &gt;&gt; because of the law of entropy. Entropy is what causes food to cool naturally. You ever wonder why it don't just stay hot? Why does it cool but never get reheated? Right? If a if the temperature remains constant, food will cool down, right? To room temperature. And the only way to get it to to get heated again is to introduce a heat source. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Right. So listen, and the same thing is true of our lives. You take a uh ice, you know, ice is in you can put it in your remember when we used to put it in our refrigerator and it was square because we had it in a one of them things that we never refilled. we always put back in the freezer and let mom refill. Some of y'all know what I'm talking about. We had a little ice thing and and you take it out and use all the ice and put it back empty in the freezer. My wife used to get so upset at that. We'd always put it empty. We didn't have the money to have an ice machine, you know, and we just put that thing back in. Some of y'all may still use those. And but have you ever wondered why that if it you let it sit out, it'll melt, but it'll never become square again? Because order doesn't come about naturally. &gt;&gt; I hope you're hearing me today. &gt;&gt; People are just waiting on something to happen as if it's just going to happen. &gt;&gt; Order doesn't come about naturally. This world didn't come about. Listen, if you believe this world would come about by evolution, why don't you take off your watch and separate it in a million pieces and shake it for a million years or billion years, however long you want to, and see if it becomes a watch again. It'll never become a watch because order doesn't come naturally. Disorder becomes naturally. Some of you elderly folks know what I'm talking about, right? Your body fails naturally, &gt;&gt; but healing only comes from him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Listen, cooling off comes naturally to a church. &gt;&gt; Cooling off, backsliding comes naturally to a human being. But order comes by the word &gt;&gt; like he did in the beginning when the earth was without form and void. Oh, come on church. Somebody ought to take that and preach a whole sermon on it. Order comes from the word, but disorder comes naturally, but order comes by the spoken word and the word is spoken in our day and said, "Let there be light." And there was light. Let there be a bride and there was a bride. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The only reason we're here Oh, come on, church. The only reason we have any order to our services, we have any order to our lives, is because God sent a prophet. And he didn't just let that prophet speak what he wanted to, but he spoke through him and it spoke order. &gt;&gt; It called us back to the word, which is God's order. &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; See, we must have revival or we will become cold, formal, and powerless. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; It's true. &gt;&gt; Just naturally. Like a if you set out water, I've talked about this before. You set out a cup of water, you won't even notice it. In a week, come back and that water will be almost gone. Where did it go? Na nature, evaporation. The energy stopped moving. It stopped moving and it slowly evaporates into the air. The same way our our our our fervor, our See, you can't lose your salvation like that. I know what some of you are thinking. You don't lose your salvation, but you lose the joy of it &gt;&gt; naturally. It just kind of goes into the air. See, every morning he'd come down there and he'd come to church, you know, and he spread out his blanket in the same spot. He had his little spot in the church. Some of y'all I wouldn't I wouldn't know if you're alive if you weren't sitting in the same spots, you know. Even our kids, they got their little spots, you know, and they they sit in their spot and and he had his little blanket. He spread it down there, little cot. He laid down on it. He said, "You know, I can walk a little. I can get here. I can make it to church, but I just can't seem to get to the water. Just can't before." See, I watch other people get blessed, but I just can't seem to get to the water. He's just laying there thinking about it. He'd been there for maybe 38 years. Maybe the whole time he'd been sick, thinking about it. And oh, once he kind of felt somebody near him, a shadow come over him. He said, "Who are you?" He said, ' Do you want to be well? &gt;&gt; Well, I don't have any man. I would get well, but the preacher, &gt;&gt; come on. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "That don't matter. Do you want to be well?" &gt;&gt; Said, "But my husband, do you want to be well?" &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; My wife, do you want to be well? &gt;&gt; My children, do you want to be well? Wilt thou be made whole? You see, the fact that he asked him that question meant it was for him. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And I may not have time to go through all this this morning, but in Psalm 42:7, David says, "Deep calleth to deep at the noise of thy water spouts." A deep is a main body of water or or a spring, a place where the where the water comes from. the deep calls, the deep spring calls to another deep spring. So, Brother Brandham takes that and he said, "If there's a deep calling, there must be another deep to respond." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If there was a word looking for you and it come by your way and it said, "Do you want to be well?" Jesus never asked that question. There were 4,999 people sitting there that never heard the question. But you found out about the message. You heard the question. Do you want to be well? How did you hear the question? Because Jesus come by your way. &gt;&gt; He said deep was calling to the deep. See, if there's something in you calling, there must be a revival for you. &gt;&gt; It was Samson who stood there one day after he had slaughtered a thousand Philistines. He killed a thousand of them with the jawbone of a mule. actually a donkey. There's even a smaller jawbone, more brittle, laying out in the desert. He picks it up and kills a thousand armored Philistines with it. &gt;&gt; When he gets done, he gets thirsty. Cuz working for the Lord, many times we give, but we don't take in. Listen to me, deacons, trustees, preachers. We give but we don't take in enough. &gt;&gt; We give and we give constantly. constantly give. &gt;&gt; But if we're not careful, we don't receive. That's why my burden's been even for those in the back and those trying to help out in the services. Sometimes you do that over and over and over again and you're giving, but you end up like Samson at the end and you say, "Well, I've given and I've given and I've given." Some of you mamas do that for your own family. You give and you work and you give and you work and you don't stop from daylight till dusk and you don't realize you've been given. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But not receiving. Yes sir. Yes. &gt;&gt; You get thirsty. But Samson had enough about him that he knew he was dry and he began to cry out. The Bible said it come to pass when he made it into speaking he cast away the jawbone out of his hand. He called that place Ramoth liy which means jaw. And he was sore thirst and called on the Lord and said thou hast given this great deliverance into the hand of thy servant. Now shall I die for thirst and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised? He needed revival. &gt;&gt; But God &gt;&gt; rich in mercy. &gt;&gt; Oh, aren't you glad there's a revival for you today? God rich in mercy clave a hollow place that was in the jaw and there came water there. And when he had drunk, his spirit came again and he revived. Wherefore when he he called the name thereof inhor which is in Lehi and to this day inhor means the spring of one who called the spring of one calling. Oh church there's a spring for somebody that'll call. Brother said there's never been found a better way to receive from God than to ask for it. &gt;&gt; No wonder Jesus asked the man the question do you want to be well? The word come by his way knowing he had a deep desire to be well. Hallelujah. The B said here not long ago when the church began to cool off and get formal through the great Wesley revival, people begin to hunger for more of God. If you hunger for more of God, there's bound to be more of God to respond to it somewhere. If you've only been justified by faith and know nothing about the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you hunger for it, there's got to be a Holy Ghost somewhere to fill that hungering. That's right. And if you believe today there is a God who heals, there's got to be a fountain open somewhere. Oh, come on, sick people. Don't you realize there's a fountain open. The God who said, "I am the God that health thee is walking right among you this morning." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Said, "If you believe today there's a God who heals, there's got to be a fountain open somewhere &gt;&gt; for healing or that desire wouldn't be there." Like Simeon who expected to see the Messiah. There was a deep calling to the deep. Brother man said, "Now look, if the Holy Spirit has promised you something and you've been expecting it, it's up to the Holy Spirit then to see that you're led to it." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How many has been expecting revival? He said, "All right, now maybe this is the time." He's led you to it. &gt;&gt; He brought you to church this morning. &gt;&gt; We might as well have revival. &gt;&gt; Come on. He said, "If there's a revival in making, he will bring you right in." &gt;&gt; How many has been expecting healing? He said, "Sure." All right. Then here you are right at the fountain. David, hallelujah. David said, "When the deep calls to the deep, but there's a deep calling on the inside, there's got to be a deep somewhere to respond to that deep." He said, "Before," he said, "Here, your people live by the seaside. Before there was a fin on a fish's back, there had to be a water first for him to swim in, or he would never had no fin." Yeah. &gt;&gt; Well, that's good Kentucky reasoning right there, isn't it? &gt;&gt; What good is the fin without the water? &gt;&gt; See, the evolutionists believe that he just had to grow a fin to swim. Well, what did he do in the meantime? &gt;&gt; It's a good question. &gt;&gt; But God made a fin on him &gt;&gt; cuz he had water for him to swim in. Come on. &gt;&gt; There's people trying to grow fins. You know, they come to church and be like, "I, you know, I got to here's water. I got to swim." No, that's not how you do it. You can't grow yourself a fin. God made you a fin. He made you a fish. He made you able to to receive from the spirit of God. Don't think you can't do it. You can or you would never been called to it. Do you want to be well? Do you want revival? You can have revival. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Right? &gt;&gt; There's got to be a deep somewhere to respond to the deep. He said the fish, there had to be a water first for him to swim in. He never had no fin. Before there was a tree to grow in the earth, there had to be an earth first or there'd be no tree to grow in it. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham talked about the boy eating sulfur. He said he would eat rubber cuz there's sulfur in it. &gt;&gt; I used to eat my p, you know, racers off of pencils. I think it was just nerves, but but he said this little boy would eat the the pedals off a bicycle. &gt;&gt; He said, "Why does he do that?" Because there's something in a boy craving for sulfur. &gt;&gt; That rubber had sulfur in it. He didn't even know that. Listen, he didn't need a a breakdown of what was in it. Some of us are waiting on God to just reveal everything to us. Show me where the sulfur is. Follow the craving of your heart. &gt;&gt; If it's craving for spiritual things, follow that to him. &gt;&gt; God never sent Simeon a map. He was just walking by the spirit. He never sent him a map and said it had a little X on it said you are here &gt;&gt; and here is the baby Jesus. &gt;&gt; He never sent blind Anna a map. She couldn't have read it anyway. &gt;&gt; But she still found Jesus. &gt;&gt; How did she find him? Hallelujah. Because she was predestined for ordained to find him. How did you find the message of the hour? You were predestined and for ordained to find Listen, you say, "Well, I come up in the message, but I come up difficult. I come up my my parents didn't do it right and this one didn't do it right and that one and I've had a difficult time but do you realize how blessed you are to have even been exposed to the message of the hour? What is it? You say, "Well, well, they didn't do it right." But just cuz they didn't do it right, they may not have been doing it for them. They may have just said they were believers for you, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; Oh, God. Oh, I hope you're hearing it today. There might have been hypocrite after hypocrite after hypocrite come and it might been just to call you. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said if you're thirsting for more of God, how many would like to have more of God? How many could say amen to that this morning? &gt;&gt; How many would like to have more of God? He said if you're thirsting for more of God, he said it shows there's more of God for you to have. &gt;&gt; That's right. You want to be healed. Well, just as sure as you believe God is a healer. There's a fountain open somewhere or you'd never have that desire. If you crave to have the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; that shows there's a fountain open somewhere. Hallelujah. filled with the Holy Ghost. See, there has to be a creator to create the creation. And then there has to be something out there to respond to that creation. Hallelujah. Oh Lord, he said, "Now, the Holy Spirit was obligated then to lead him to that fountain." Oh, if you're expecting it, the same Holy Spirit leads you to that fountain. It's got to open up somewhere. If you've got that burning desire in your heart, the Holy Spirit is obligated to lead you to it, right? To that fountain filled with blood drawn from Emanuel's veins. &gt;&gt; We're sinners. He said, "That's unbelievers. Plunge beneath the flood and lose all their unbelief." I said, "God, take it all away from me today. Let me plunge. Lead me to the fountain &gt;&gt; where I can have my unbelief washed away." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, you want to be to a place where you can surpass any doubt &gt;&gt; in your mind. &gt;&gt; Hear me for a minute. I'm challenging you this morning. Sitting there say, "Well, I wonder if this is true. I wonder I wonder if that's true." Do you want to be to a place that can surpass any doubt in your mind? Do you want to be sure that you have the Holy Ghost? Do you want to be sure the message is true? &gt;&gt; Don't you want to be that way? Well, there's a fountain somewhere to do that. &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; So, you think you need explanation, but really what you need is to get the leadership of the Holy Ghost to just lead you to the fountain. Listen, brother. Brandon said he's praying and I won't read all this, but he talked about the people being under expectation. We're going to skip down a couple of paragraphs, three paragraphs now. He said, "May there be such a great cry go out among the people thirsting for God till there will come a revival throughout the country here. Every church will be packed full of people. Sinners crying out for God to have mercy. the Holy Spirit, healing the sick, making the lame to walk, raising up the dead, and granting those things that's been promised in thy word. &gt;&gt; He said, "Come, Lord Jesus, and fulfill thy promise. Come to us tonight. We believe that you're the same yesterday, today, and forever. That your promises cannot fail. Both heavens and earth will fail, but your word will not fail. May our understanding be open. May the Holy Spirit come and lay the fow ground. May our understanding be open to what? to the spirit and power of God tonight that he might manifest his promised words through us. &gt;&gt; What is he saying? If the church is gathered to want revival, there must be revival. So he said, "Lord, come and send a revival." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; See, the man was waiting on the moving of the water. &gt;&gt; But his revival come and tapped him on the shoulder &gt;&gt; and said, "Do you want it? Do you want to be well? said, "You call for revival. You wait for your church to have a revival." Well, that ain't the revival for you. The revival ought to begin right in you. When you begin to thirst for God, there might not be another member of the church wanting that revival, but if it breaks out in you, it'll break out other places. &gt;&gt; Is there something in you today that's longing for renewing of the Holy Ghost? I just want to stir that up today. I believe it's there. I just want to stir it up. Is there something in you that longs for renewal? Is there something in you that longs for a revival? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I just about shouted and run and spoke in tongues the other day when I saw grass growing out here. &gt;&gt; Where we had poured dirt. You don't know how that made me feel. We grew grass in January. It's ry grass, but it'll it'll work till the warm weather comes &gt;&gt; and the weather's cooperated. But I got so excited. My kids do not understand why I was so excited to see that become green because church there's a desire in my heart. I want to see I have it in my mind a picture. I want to see green grass kids playing volleyball out there all getting along. There's something in my mind, in my spirit. Me and Brother Joel were thinking about it and talking about it. This is what we want. And we presented to the trustees and they said, "Let's do it." And and the church has gotten behind it and we put it out there and and and now it's starting to grow. And there's something in me when I see it. What does it do? It's a deep calling to the deep. There was something in me calling for it. And now it's starting to come. Oh, I hope you're hearing me today, church. It's just like that. When you come to the house of God, don't you want to feel his presence? Don't you want to see them little green shoots? It might be winter time. It might be leosia. It might be a hard time. It might be hard and stony ground, but there will be some grass grow. If you'll set the conditions right, what did we do? We just sowed the grass and started watering it and started watering it and started watering it. What do you do? Sew the Let the grass be sown. I believe it's been sown. The word has been sown in your heart. Then you start to water that. Brother Brandham taught us how to water it. He said, "Water it praises. &gt;&gt; Water with your Don't you realize, listen, if you had a bunch of grass you want to grow, you'd get out there with a water hose like me. I have and my wife has and get out there and water that grass. I'll tell you what, if you wanted it to grow, that's what you do. If you really wanted revival, you begin to call out for it. You begin to raise your hands in the house of God. &gt;&gt; You begin to do what it takes. &gt;&gt; To have it, &gt;&gt; I need a job, but I must have revival. Yeah. &gt;&gt; I need my family, but I must have revival or I'll lose my family. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; I want this church. I want everything to be right and all the all the stuff in it, all the the building and the and the doors and everything to be just right. But I must have revival. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; See, we are not waiting on a man to come by and help us get to the water. The man is here &gt;&gt; and he's not me. He's the word. &gt;&gt; See, the Bible says, "I will pour water upon him that is thirsty and floods upon the dry ground. I'll pour my spirit upon thy seed." My blessing upon thine offspring. &gt;&gt; Oh, if it made my heart leap for joy when I saw grass grow, how much more does it make my heart leap for joy when I see the spirit begin to show itself in the lives of these young people? When I see people who've been backsitting begin to come back to God, begin to serve God with all of their heart. When I begin to see green grass grow, &gt;&gt; oh, it does something in my heart. I pray it would do something in all of our hearts. &gt;&gt; Listen, he said in Isaiah 55:1, "Oh, everyone that thirsteth, come ye to the waters. He that hath no money, come ye buy and eat, come by wine and milk without money and without price." Matthew 5:6, blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they, someone say it with me, they shall be filled. They shall be filled. Hallelujah. I believe that's true this morning. In John 7:37, Jesus stood up. This is after he'd come and healed the man at Bethesda, he stood up in that great day of the feast, and he cried, saying, "If any man thirst, let him come unto me and drink." But he's got to be thirsty. But he put a thirst in you for a reason. If any man thirst, let him come and drink. He that believeth on me, as the scripture said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He is speaking now. We're not just looking at the sign, but the voice of the sign is spoken in our day. The word has been preached in his fullness. He's speaking now through the prophet and the bride. She under her messenger will be the final voice to the final age. The Bible says, "And the spirit and the bride say, come." Let him that hearth say, "Come." Let him that is a thirst. &gt;&gt; Come on. Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let him come. This is not the hour of no revival. This is the hour of the bride's revival. &gt;&gt; Let the elected come. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Whosoever will let him take the water of life freely. He said, "But Ben, I'm thirsty. What do I do?" Jesus saith unto the man, "Rise." &gt;&gt; That's an action of faith. &gt;&gt; He wouldn't have risen from there unless he believed that the word was present. Once he recognizes it, rise. &gt;&gt; Take up thy bed and walk. Change your posture from waiting to receiving. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; From laying there &gt;&gt; to expectation. &gt;&gt; Very good. &gt;&gt; From just going to church. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; To expecting God to move. &gt;&gt; Change your posture. &gt;&gt; See, obedience is better than sacrifice. The Bible says, Listen, brother Brandham says this and I'm closing. He said, 'What about you down on the cases? I believe there's a lot of cot cases spiritually. A lot of cot cases, people who can't seem to walk like they should walk spiritually. Walk with the Lord. A lot of cot cases around. He said, "Do you believe?" What about you on the cot cases? Do you believe? He said, "You believe me?" He said, "You've been sitting there, lady. I looked at you a while ago. Now, now this is something important. You catch this. Here was a lady who was interested in somebody else. And the prophet sees the lady's interest in another person. &gt;&gt; It pays to care about people. &gt;&gt; This lady is interested in a little girl. Maybe it was her daughter. Maybe it's her niece. We don't know. But he said, "You're interested in that little girl laying there. Is that right?" He said, "I can't heal the child." Look, it wasn't so much the the faith of the child that reached out to him. It was the faith of the woman who was interested in the child. Could we have a church full of people that are interested in our young people? &gt;&gt; Could we have a church full of people that are interested in the word being preached, that are interested in the songs being sung, that are interested in the worship. &gt;&gt; They were interested. Maybe you got somebody today you're interested in. The word is here &gt;&gt; to speak to that person. Even if they're not here this morning, the word is not bound by walls. &gt;&gt; It can go right down where they're laying. Speak to them. He said, "You were interested." He said, "I can't heal the child. Look this way, young lady. Do you believe me to be God's prophet, sister?" He said, "If you lay there, you'll die." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He said, "The trouble's in the stomach." Isn't that right? He said, "Very bad, too. Nothing can help you outside of God." He said, 'Would you take my word for something? &gt;&gt; What if we could take a prophet's words for something this morning? &gt;&gt; He said, 'The angel of Almighty God is standing near your cot. &gt;&gt; She couldn't see it, but she could believe it when a prophet said it. &gt;&gt; Oh, God. You realize the same prophet that told her that said, "If you could see," he said, "If you could press through the veil of the flesh, you'd see angels at their position at every pew." &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; If you can believe, if you could take his word for something, he said, "There's the angel of almighty God is standing by your c." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; He's interested in your condition. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. I know it's been evangelistic for a Sunday morning, but I just I just felt it on my heart. &gt;&gt; He said, "I see your examination." He said, "I hear what he tells you." The girl didn't even know how bad off she was. &gt;&gt; They'd hid it from her. &gt;&gt; You may come to church thinking you were okay, but as the word was being preached, it began to discern the thought of your heart and you said, "Lord, I need more of you." Yes. &gt;&gt; He said, "I see your examination. I hear what he tells you. They're keeping something back from you. But let me tell you, if you believe Jesus Christ to be your healer and will accept him to be so, will you serve him all the days of your life, you'll do it?" He said, "Then as a servant of God, I command you." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now, this is different because Pentecostals of the day would have commanded God. &gt;&gt; But that's not what brother Brandham did. See, we don't command God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham didn't even command the evil spirit. He commanded her. &gt;&gt; He said, "I command you cuz greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world." &gt;&gt; I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to take up your bed and go home and get Well, don't you fear. You have strength. You have strength. Don't worry. Rise up. go home. &gt;&gt; Now, what is it? Just the act of standing and rolling up her cot. &gt;&gt; Right? That that's what the man did that Jesus spoke to. Just he was a cot case. Just the act of standing &gt;&gt; and rolling up his cot meant he was divorcing himself from the idea of being sick. &gt;&gt; And accepting the idea of being well. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. You say, "Well, I'll come to church when I feel like it. I'll come to church when I get everything in order." No. Come to church right now. Come to church while you're sick. Come to church even if you got sin in your life. You come and when you hear the word preached, take up that old thing and start to roll it up and start to walk with God. And if you'll walk away from it, your sickness can be left there at that disappointing pool. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, I believe we ought to speak as if we're speaking every day to dying people because we are. &gt;&gt; We don't know what tomorrow holds. He said, 'Lady, I speak again to lay there is death in the name of Jesus Christ. Rise up. He said, ' There it is. Don't ever disobey the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Do you want revival as the musicians come? Obey the word. Change your expectation. Clean up your house. Fold up your security blanket. The reason brother Brandham said to apply the token over your house and get rid of all the filth. It's not because you say, "Well, that that stuff in there, you know, I I can't be a Christian and that stuff will keep me from being a Christian." No, you could be the worst sinner could stagger off the street and become a Christian. &gt;&gt; Right? But the reason you want to clean up your house cuz you want to apply the token to your house for your household. Roll up that cot, that security blanket you've been holding on to, that thing that you use to keep you happy, to make you satisfied. Cut the umbilical cord, if you will, of the world. Take up your bed. Get off social media if you have to. Come on, church. We need to get real about it. &gt;&gt; Throw the phone in the trash if you have to. people survive without them. Do what needs to be done to make sure that you know that you want to be well. He said, "Stand up, rise up, take up your cot." He said, "There it is. Don't ever disobey the spirit of God. Take up your bed. The word has come in our day and commanded take up your bed and walk." We're not waiting on the on the water to be moved anymore. We're not waiting on a revival to sweep through. You say, "Well, if I could just make it to this camp meeting or this meeting over here." No, the word is standing right by you. If you can believe a prophet's words, the angel of the Lord is standing right by you. Pick up your bed and walk. Rise up and go home. Does your heart long for freedom? Is there something in you like Samson when he stood there between the two pillars? He said, "Once more, Lord. There's something in me that wants liberty." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Oh, God. I'm tired of being bound down in church. I'm tired of not being able to worship. I'm tired of not being able to break through. It's time for me to have liberty. You don't have to wait on that, church. I receive it in Jesus name. Something in you like Samson willing to risk death for liberty. Death to ideas, death to the flesh, death to the world. And rise up, take up your bed and walk. Hallelujah. Start acting like a Christian. live like a Christian. Come to the house of God. Worship the Lord until your body begins to obey your confession. Brother Brand said, don't ever say you're not a Christian. You begin to speak it and then you begin to believe it and pretty soon you begin to obey it. Hallelujah. Act like there's no trouble in the home. Act like, "Oh, come on, church. Act like there's nothing going on in your life." Say, "Well, I got all kinds of problems." Rise up, take up your bed, and walk. There's liberty here. There's freedom here. &gt;&gt; I wonder if we could do that today. Let's stand together. Rise up. Come on, church. Rise up. Take up your bed. Roll up that old security blanket and walk with God. Hallelujah. I don't know what you have need of this morning, but would you raise your hand to him? Raise your hand to him right now if you if your heart longs for freedom. If you want a refilling of the Holy Ghost, we're not waiting. We're not tearing on the Holy Ghost to come. He's already here. He's walking right by you. If you need that in your life today, if you need the spirit like I need the spirit. If you need to know his presence like I need to know his presence, let's just talk to him now. Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, I ask you to come, Lord, in your power and your glory. Lord, I ask you to come. Here is a deep calling. Oh God, there's a deep calling in the hearts of the people who have been stirred by your word to call out for revival. I pray there would be a deep to respond. I know there is, Lord. May the angels standing by the pews begin to walk up and down. Oh God, may they begin to touch. Oh God, may they begin to heal the sick. May they begin to touch the backslider. Oh Lord, I pray you'd grant it today. Oh, how we need you, God. We can't make it another day without you. We can't make it another moment, Lord. My family needs you. I need you. Oh God, our home, Lord, would fall apart without your presence. We need you. We are impotent, Lord. We are unable to do anything on our own. We need you, Lord. I pray, oh God, that your Holy Spirit would go down in every heart, in every home, oh Lord. Oh, may we receive you, oh God. Take up our bed and walk. Walk out of that depression. Walk out of that struggle. Walk out of that up and down living. Walk out of that ungodliness and come to you. Walk out of that sickness and be made well. If your prophet told us to picture our new body, our well body, and walk towards it, I pray you'd grant it today. Oh, give us a vision, Lord. Help us to hear your word. We pray in Jesus name. Hallelujah. Why don't we water the word now? If you need prayer, the altar's open. You can come pray or I'll be glad to pray with you. Why don't you just Why don't you just worship him now? Hallelujah. You now, Lord, our spirit out. Oh, hallelujah. Spirit out on me, oh God. Oh Lord Jesus, we need revival every moment. Lord, yesterday's revival won't work. We need you today, Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, put a desire in our heart, oh God. &gt;&gt; Oh, put something in my heart, Lord, that cries out for you. &gt;&gt; Oh, Granny Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Granny Lord Jesus. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, fill my heart, Granny Lord God. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Thank you Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh Lord, I need you now. Pour your spirit out. Lord, I seek you. Help me find you. How I need your touch. Find my drying broken places thirsty for your love. Lord, forgive me if I wonder far away from you. Father, &gt;&gt; you are all I ever needed. Come and make me new. Pour your spirit out on me. &gt;&gt; Called just like the rain. &gt;&gt; Saturate my thirsty soul. Come and fall aresh on me and fill my cup with you. Heal my heart and make me whole. Lord, I need you now. Pour your spirit out. Sing the chorus again. Pour your spirit out on me. Oh, fall just like the rain. &gt;&gt; Oh yes, Lord. Oh w on me. Won't you feel my cup again? Heal my heart and make me whole. &gt;&gt; Lord, I need you now for your spirit and fill my cup. Lord, I lift it up. &gt;&gt; Oh, we thank you, Lord Jesus. Why don't you just receive whatever you have need of this morning? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Lift your hands to him and just receive it from him. Lord, I believe you're here. Come and fill my cup, oh God. Oh, granted, Lord Jesus, my soul. Hallelujah. Oh, thank you, Lord Jesus. Oh bread of heaven. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh you. &gt;&gt; Oh we thank you Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; I want more. Fill my cup. Fill it up and make me whole. Oh, here's my cup, Lord. Oh, here's my cup, Lord.

Thank you, Lord Jesus. I thank you, Lord Jesus. Hallelujah. We love you, Lord. Oh, I love you, Jesus. Come and Oh, we worship you, Lord. this thirsty my soul. Oh bread of heaven, won't you feed me till I won't no more. Here my f it up and make me whole. Now there are millions in this world who are seeking for pleasures. earthly goodness of hope. Oh, but none can match this wonderous treasure that I find in Jesus Christ my Lord. Oh. Oh. Feel my glory. I lift it up and this thirsting of my soul. Oh bread of heaven, won't you fear? I want no more. Here's my cup. Fill it up and make me whole. And all is well. All is well. Oh, we have heard the message and all is well. Oh yes, there is a place of perfect rest behind the bell. So rest little bride rest for all is well. Is it well this morning? Oh yes, all is well. Oh, all is well. Yes, we have heard the message and all is well. Oh, for there is a place of birth gra behind the veil. So rest little bride rest for all his way. And God is so good. Yes, God is so good. Yes, he is. God is so good. He's so good. He He answers prayers. I know that he he answers prayers. Yes, he answer. Yes, he answer. He's so good, too. He saved my soul. Did he do it for you? I know that he save my soul. Yes, he saved my soul. Oh, he saved my soul. He's so good, too. Do you love him this morning? Let me hear you sing it like this. Oh, yes, I I love him so. Yes, I love him so. Yes, I love him so.

Did you enjoy the word of the Lord this morning? Go ahead and give him praises. Amen. I believe we could say yes to that. If you want a revival, I need a revival.
