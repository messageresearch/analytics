[53:20] amen thank the
[53:23] Lord amen Psalms chapter 88 going to
[53:27] read verses 1-9 to begin
[53:29] Psalms chapter 88 I don't know if you've
[53:32] ever read Psalms chapter 88 but it's
[53:36] a it's a sad song in fact it's
[53:39] considered to be the the saddest song
[53:43] saddest Psalm in the
[53:46] Bible and I want to speak to you tonight
[53:48] on how to be happy but we're going to
[53:51] begin that by reading the saddest
[53:54] scripture or what's considered the
[53:56] saddest scripture in the Bible but I
[53:59] hope that it makes sense when we get
[54:00] done because we all want to be happy and
[54:04] yet we know that there's a deeper
[54:06] happiness and joy than what the world
[54:08] has that's for us as Christians Psalms
[54:12] 88 and
[54:14] one I appreciate your your offering to
[54:16] brother Danny it wasn't uh it was the
[54:20] brothers in the church had that idea to
[54:22] do that and I'm so thankful that you
[54:24] love one another and care for one
[54:25] another
[54:26] we should all do that look out for one
[54:28] another and show our appreciation
[54:31] especially to those who have put in the
[54:33] work and and and stood here over the
[54:36] years and we wouldn't have a church here
[54:38] I don't believe if it wasn't for brother
[54:40] Danny Ward and and so I'm thankful at
[54:42] least I wouldn't be here so I'm thankful
[54:45] for brother Danny and and for each one
[54:47] of you that are here tonight you're you
[54:49] being here on a Wednesday night matters
[54:51] and and and I don't let the devil beat
[54:53] you up about that just you being here
[54:56] the good so good to see you and sister
[54:57] Sharon tonight you being here matters
[55:00] and and because you're here I believe
[55:02] God will give you an extra helping an
[55:04] extra blessing tonight Psalms 88 And1 oh
[55:08] Lord God of my salvation I've cried day
[55:11] and night before thee let my prayer come
[55:14] before thee incline thine ear to my cry
[55:18] my soul is full of troubles my life
[55:21] draweth nigh unto the grave I'm am
[55:24] counted with them that go down down into
[55:26] the pit I am as a man that hath no
[55:30] strength free among the dead like the
[55:32] slain that lie in the grave and th
[55:34] rememberest no more they are cut off
[55:37] from thy hand thou Hast laid me in the
[55:40] lowest pit in darkness in the deeps th
[55:43] wrath lith hard upon me thou has
[55:46] Afflicted me with all thy waves Sila CA
[55:49] means stop I think he had to
[55:52] stop you couldn't just take this Psalm
[55:54] all at once we'll read the next two
[55:56] verses thou H has put away mine
[55:58] acquaintance far from me th has made me
[56:01] an Abomination unto them I am shut up I
[56:04] cannot come forth my my eye mourneth by
[56:08] reason of Affliction Lord I have called
[56:10] daily upon thee I have stretched out my
[56:14] hands unto thee I pray the Lord would
[56:16] add his Blessing to the word you may be
[56:24] seated this is uh literally
[56:26] in the title it's a song of Affliction
[56:30] or illness To Be Sung mournfully by The
[56:33] Choir it actually says to sing it in a
[56:37] mournful
[56:38] way and the writer is a man named uh h e
[56:43] m an is pronounced hymon hmon is a
[56:48] levite he's a seir he he prophesies in
[56:51] music he's a singer and he's a symbol
[56:54] player and so we could say he was a
[56:57] drummer uh but he had a he had a
[57:01] something that happened in his life and
[57:03] we don't know what it was but it seems
[57:05] to be sickness chronic sickness that
[57:09] that was uh something that overtook his
[57:11] life and he just got to a place where he
[57:14] only writes one scripture one chapter in
[57:17] the Bible and it was Psalms
[57:20] 88 and he's an interesting person
[57:23] because his job in the temple is
[57:26] literally to sing joyful songs all right
[57:30] that's that's his job is to sing joyful
[57:33] songs in the temple and in 1 Chronicles
[57:36] 15:16 David spoke to the chief of the
[57:38] Levites to appoint their Brethren uh to
[57:41] be the singers with instruments of music
[57:43] sultes and harps and symbols sounding by
[57:46] lifting up the voice with joy so there
[57:50] was people appointed just to sing Happy
[57:54] songs I you know I I think we had some
[57:56] of that tonight and so there was people
[57:59] appointed to do that and you say well
[58:01] that's just working people up no
[58:03] sometimes people need to remember that
[58:05] they have something to be happy about
[58:07] and and sometimes we need to do that so
[58:10] there were Levites that were done just
[58:12] that were there just for that purpose so
[58:14] the Levites appointed hmon the son of
[58:17] Joel and his Brethren Asaf the son of
[58:20] barakah and the sons of marari their
[58:22] Brethren Ethan the son of kayah and then
[58:25] and and uh verse 19 says so the singers
[58:28] hymon Asaf and Ethan were appointed to
[58:32] sound with symbols of brass so they
[58:35] their their job now it's hard to be
[58:37] mournful uh on the
[58:40] drums it's difficult to be mournful with
[58:44] symbols right it just kind of breaks
[58:46] that up a little bit and and yet so that
[58:49] but his job was to take the symbols and
[58:53] actually Clash them together and yet
[58:57] and and it was more than just a job but
[58:58] it was a it was part of his life he he
[59:01] and all his children prophesied in their
[59:03] music in 1 Chronicles 255 it says all
[59:07] these were the sons of Amon the king
[59:09] seir in the words of God that's a
[59:11] powerful it means he he he had a a
[59:13] prophecy in music there was something
[59:16] that God used him in a not just in a
[59:18] regular way but in a prophetic way in
[59:21] music and so we know that that Psalm
[59:23] that was written was inspired we know
[59:26] Psalm 88 was inspired by God so he he
[59:30] was one of the wisest men of his age he
[59:34] he was uh the Bible says he was one of
[59:37] the wisest men except Solomon he was
[59:39] counted as one of the three or four
[59:41] wisest men in the Kingdom at that time
[59:44] he stood before Kings and played joyful
[59:48] songs and yet the only song he wrote
[59:51] that we still have today almost needs a
[59:54] trigger warning
[59:57] right when you read it I'm just being
[59:58] honest with you you know when you read
[1:00:01] the Psalms you get to Psalm 88 you're
[1:00:03] looking for the hope you know cuz
[1:00:05] usually David's all up and down you know
[1:00:07] he's singing he's he's writing Psalms
[1:00:09] that I'm going down to the pit but Lord
[1:00:10] you're lifting me up right and David's
[1:00:13] always like that he's up and down even
[1:00:15] There's Hope even in Psalms uh uh 53 I
[1:00:18] believe it is the one where uh he uh
[1:00:21] actually uh at his prayer of repentance
[1:00:24] There's Hope in that he said he said
[1:00:26] restore unto me the joy of my salvation
[1:00:28] and you find Hope in that but there's
[1:00:30] very little hope found in Psalms 88 in
[1:00:33] fact the only positive thing that I
[1:00:35] could find is that it is a prayer to the
[1:00:38] god of Salvation and I'm so glad that
[1:00:41] when we're in our darkest moments and in
[1:00:43] our worst moments and in the worst parts
[1:00:45] of our Lives he's still the god of our
[1:00:48] salvation and so I want to tell you
[1:00:50] tonight that hmon was not an unbeliever
[1:00:52] he was a Believer yeah but he was just
[1:00:54] going through some things
[1:00:57] huh and the longer you live the more you
[1:00:59] realize you're going to go through some
[1:01:01] things I heard an interview today with a
[1:01:04] singer and and they said that they sang
[1:01:06] a song it was about God being a way
[1:01:09] maker not the one that we commonly sing
[1:01:11] but a different one and they were uh
[1:01:14] they were singing about that and and the
[1:01:16] first time they sang it they took it to
[1:01:17] a young person and the young person said
[1:01:20] oh it's okay but they took it to an
[1:01:22] elder and the Elder said sing that that
[1:01:24] means something to me
[1:01:26] and the songwriter realized that that
[1:01:29] the young person couldn't had hadn't
[1:01:31] lived long enough to actually have
[1:01:33] reached a place where they'd ever
[1:01:36] experienced the kind uh of place that
[1:01:39] that song would speak to them and I
[1:01:41] think uh for some of us that have lived
[1:01:43] a while and some of you have lived a
[1:01:44] whole lot longer than I have you
[1:01:46] eventually experienced the kind of place
[1:01:48] like came on experience you you
[1:01:50] experience something in your life that
[1:01:52] there's just nothing good about it
[1:01:53] there's no positive part of it and yet
[1:01:56] God is still God he's still the god of
[1:01:59] Salvation how many can say Amen to that
[1:02:01] tonight he's still the god that's going
[1:02:03] to bring us out and so the very fact the
[1:02:07] the song is a prayer it's a prayer and
[1:02:10] that means if it's a prayer he still
[1:02:13] believed in
[1:02:14] God now he was faithful to pray even
[1:02:18] though he was evidently Afflicted from
[1:02:20] his youth he wanted to do something for
[1:02:23] Jehovah in Psalm 8810 it says well thou
[1:02:26] show wonders to the dead shall the dead
[1:02:28] arise and praise thee CA shall thy
[1:02:30] loving kindness be declared in the grave
[1:02:33] or Thy Faithfulness in destruction shall
[1:02:35] thy wonders be known in the dark th
[1:02:38] righteousness in the land of
[1:02:40] forgetfulness but unto thee have I cried
[1:02:42] oh Lord and in the morning shall my
[1:02:45] prayer prevent Thee I love this he's
[1:02:49] going through a dark time and it wasn't
[1:02:51] a temporary Darkness it was something
[1:02:54] that seemed to consume his life but he
[1:02:56] says I'm going to pray even though you
[1:02:58] don't seem to
[1:02:59] answer I'm going to I'm going to call
[1:03:02] out to you Lord even though it seems
[1:03:04] like the heavens are brass I'm going to
[1:03:06] pray anyway I'm going to keep going to
[1:03:08] the house of God I'm going to keep doing
[1:03:09] what God called me to do why because I
[1:03:12] know somehow somehow he'll make it right
[1:03:16] somehow he's still God somehow it don't
[1:03:18] make sense to me but he's still God it
[1:03:20] it it doesn't have any Rhyme or Reason
[1:03:22] to it but he's still Jehovah and he's
[1:03:25] still worthy of my
[1:03:27] praise amen yes but there's sometimes
[1:03:30] you can't sometimes you just have to
[1:03:33] express what you
[1:03:37] feel and that's
[1:03:40] okay that's all right yes sir come on
[1:03:43] sometimes I know that's not positive
[1:03:45] thinking and we should always be
[1:03:46] positive but sometimes you do have to
[1:03:48] acknowledge hey I'm
[1:03:50] sick I need
[1:03:54] help Lord
[1:03:56] I need
[1:03:57] you need you to
[1:03:59] move sometimes there has to be a
[1:04:01] desperation in our lives yes in order to
[1:04:04] get anything from God he says Lord why
[1:04:08] castest thou off my soul why hidest thou
[1:04:12] thy face from me I am Afflicted and
[1:04:15] ready to die from my youth up while I
[1:04:19] suffer thy Terrors I am distracted see
[1:04:23] brother Joel talked about that on Sunday
[1:04:24] night sometimes we we're distracted by
[1:04:27] by things of the world but sometimes
[1:04:28] we're distracted by things God allows in
[1:04:31] our life that's right and it's just it's
[1:04:33] a burden it's a it's a terror it's a
[1:04:36] it's it's a
[1:04:37] hardship and so he says thy Fierce wrath
[1:04:40] goeth over me thy Terrors have cut me
[1:04:41] off they come around about me daily like
[1:04:44] water they Compass me about together
[1:04:46] lover and friend has so put far from me
[1:04:49] and my acquaintance Into Darkness you
[1:04:51] say well brother Ben read the next verse
[1:04:53] there is no next verse
[1:04:56] that's the
[1:04:57] end of Psalm
[1:05:01] 88 I
[1:05:03] admire the writer of this
[1:05:07] Psalm how can you be that unhappy in
[1:05:09] your
[1:05:10] flesh and yet be faithful to
[1:05:14] prayer and joyful In
[1:05:18] Praise how do you play your symbols with
[1:05:20] joy when your life looks like
[1:05:24] that come on that's pretty dark picture
[1:05:27] Psalms 88 paints for us and yet he was
[1:05:31] the leader of of singing with joy down
[1:05:35] at the
[1:05:36] temple see most of us I think that I
[1:05:40] would have given up and I'll say this
[1:05:42] sometimes it's good to take a reflection
[1:05:46] you you can't just keep beating your
[1:05:47] head against the wall you can't just
[1:05:48] keep doing what you've always done
[1:05:51] sometimes you need to express it
[1:05:52] sometimes you need to take some time but
[1:05:55] in the end you're still a
[1:05:57] Christian when it's over when you come
[1:05:59] down through that Valley and you get you
[1:06:01] know there's got to be an end to it
[1:06:03] somewhere there's got to be there's got
[1:06:06] to be a mountain somewhere there's got
[1:06:07] to be a place you can see you've been
[1:06:09] going through these brambles and these
[1:06:11] briers and this forest and and you and
[1:06:13] you walked all the way through and and
[1:06:14] you just seem like there's no end to it
[1:06:16] but you know being a child of God there
[1:06:18] got to be a a top of the mountain
[1:06:20] somewhere there's got to be a hill
[1:06:22] somewhere got to be a place of praise
[1:06:24] and a place of joy and so you just keep
[1:06:27] going and you might have to take time to
[1:06:29] stop and complain but you still
[1:06:32] go you you might ask God why but you
[1:06:35] still go on oh I'm so glad for people of
[1:06:38] God tonight that are willing to do that
[1:06:41] come on
[1:06:42] Amen sometimes we just need to be
[1:06:44] truthful in expressing how we feel to
[1:06:47] god notice who was addressed to to God
[1:06:51] he didn't get on Facebook although he it
[1:06:53] did get put in the Psalms
[1:06:57] you can imagine what it must have been
[1:06:58] like in the temple theyd get around
[1:07:00] they'd sing the Psalms in order and
[1:07:02] they'd sing Psalms one and planted like
[1:07:04] a tree in the rivers of water it seemed
[1:07:07] Psalms 100 and the psalmist says
[1:07:09] everybody clap your hands clap your
[1:07:11] hands all ye people singing to God with
[1:07:13] a voice of Triumph and what are we
[1:07:15] singing today well today we're singing
[1:07:18] Psalm
[1:07:22] 888 pretty rough one by the Paul
[1:07:26] it's pretty hard I'm just preaching to
[1:07:28] you from my heart tonight but it's
[1:07:29] pretty hard to to take anything good out
[1:07:31] of that
[1:07:34] service and yet I think there's a depth
[1:07:37] to a Christian that you understand that
[1:07:40] even though you go through that you know
[1:07:42] that there's something good on the other
[1:07:45] side
[1:07:46] yes and and so what is he saying really
[1:07:50] I'm
[1:07:52] sick but but I'm addressing my prayer to
[1:07:54] God God you're my healer yeah I I'm
[1:07:58] lonely but God you're my friend how many
[1:08:01] can say Amen to that today I'm dry but
[1:08:04] you're the water I'm poor but my wealth
[1:08:08] is found in
[1:08:10] you I may be struggling but I know where
[1:08:13] the one where where the God is that can
[1:08:16] end my struggle I just got to I just got
[1:08:18] to get his attention I just got to get
[1:08:21] him on the phone I just got to talk to
[1:08:23] him one time and I know everything would
[1:08:25] be
[1:08:27] okay as job would say if I could just
[1:08:30] come to this where he is if I could just
[1:08:32] find his throne room if I could just get
[1:08:34] to the place where he is he says the
[1:08:36] Lord gives and takes away blessed be the
[1:08:38] name of the Lord the skin worms May
[1:08:41] destroy my body yet in my flesh I will
[1:08:45] see God that's pretty graphic language
[1:08:48] is he's acknowledging his condition
[1:08:49] brother brand in one place and I haven't
[1:08:52] found the quote but I know it's there I
[1:08:54] just don't know the words to search for
[1:08:55] exactly but I'm paraphrasing he said
[1:08:57] that he said that if you have cancer you
[1:09:00] don't say well you just you don't refuse
[1:09:02] to say I have cancer you acknowledge it
[1:09:05] he said but then you say But I'm
[1:09:07] Healed right you don't just say I have
[1:09:09] or I don't have it you say well yes
[1:09:11] that's what the doctor say But I'm
[1:09:13] Healed right I if you're hurting you
[1:09:15] acknowledge that you're hurting but but
[1:09:17] I know the one who's a pain taker if I'm
[1:09:20] in bondage if I can't worship like I
[1:09:22] need to if I can't praise like I need to
[1:09:24] I know that's my condition but I also
[1:09:27] know there's a God who can bring me out
[1:09:29] of that
[1:09:29] [Music]
[1:09:31] condition
[1:09:33] amen I'm a human see that's what you're
[1:09:36] acknowledging right when you acknowledge
[1:09:39] pain you're acknowledging
[1:09:41] humanity and every one of us is
[1:09:43] Afflicted with that
[1:09:48] condition do you know that we should all
[1:09:50] form a support group humans
[1:09:54] Anonymous yes you realize your pastor
[1:09:56] would be a member brother brandom would
[1:09:58] be a member Paul would be a member Moses
[1:10:01] would be a member let me shock you Jesus
[1:10:04] would be a member that's right because
[1:10:07] he come in flesh we're
[1:10:10] human oh my and we acknowledge the pain
[1:10:14] but also the one who can take away the
[1:10:16] pain that's I'm human but God is my
[1:10:19] helper Paul says it this way we have
[1:10:21] this treasure in Earth and vessels that
[1:10:24] the Excellence of the power may be of
[1:10:26] God and not of us we are troubled on
[1:10:29] every side yet not
[1:10:32] distressed oh my we are perplexed but
[1:10:35] not in despair oh if you can't find Hope
[1:10:38] in that your Wood's wet on now
[1:10:41] persecuted but not forsaken cast down
[1:10:44] but not
[1:10:45] destroyed always bearing about in the
[1:10:48] body the dying of the Lord Jesus that
[1:10:50] the life also of Jesus might be made
[1:10:53] manifest in our body
[1:10:57] I want us to ask the question tonight as
[1:10:58] we move along what would make me
[1:11:03] happy what would bring joy to my life
[1:11:07] and I'm talking about real happiness
[1:11:09] here Satan will try to answer that
[1:11:12] question every chance he
[1:11:15] gets and what Satan answers the question
[1:11:19] with is whatever you
[1:11:21] desire now think about it for a minute
[1:11:24] Satan answers the question to how can I
[1:11:26] be happy with the desire of your heart
[1:11:30] or your
[1:11:31] flesh right some desire that you have
[1:11:36] and Satan says if you would just do that
[1:11:39] you would be
[1:11:41] happy if you would just let yourself go
[1:11:45] there you would be happy I I had a man
[1:11:49] come to me he was trying to explain what
[1:11:52] he was doing in regards to his marriage
[1:11:54] and he just he just is about to make a
[1:11:56] terrible mistake go against the word and
[1:12:00] and and I asked him said what do you
[1:12:01] want he said he said I want to be
[1:12:04] happy but the worst way to make yourself
[1:12:07] happy is to go against the word
[1:12:09] especially if you're a Son of God or a
[1:12:10] daughter of
[1:12:11] God right the way to make yourself happy
[1:12:14] is to line up to the word you may
[1:12:15] temporarily be more unhappy but in the
[1:12:18] end it'll work out all
[1:12:20] right we have a you know I know people
[1:12:24] would tell me these young people
[1:12:25] sometimes said well you know if I had a
[1:12:27] girlfriend or I had a boyfriend I would
[1:12:30] be
[1:12:32] happy oh you
[1:12:34] bet you better watch what you wish
[1:12:38] for right know we've got a dog and and
[1:12:42] I've told you about our dog our dog is a
[1:12:44] Pampered dog he was a happy dog and I
[1:12:47] say was because he just recently started
[1:12:50] getting out of the
[1:12:51] fence he' been in that fence for two
[1:12:53] years and just all of a sudden he starts
[1:12:56] getting out well evidently he'd smelled
[1:12:58] another Beagle up the
[1:13:00] street and so he finds this other beagle
[1:13:03] which is odd you know it's funny birds
[1:13:05] of a feather flock together he's only
[1:13:07] half beagle but he don't know that so he
[1:13:10] he anyway he finds this other dog
[1:13:12] there's dogs all over the the place but
[1:13:14] he finds this other dog like him and he
[1:13:17] wants to go to it he he just got to that
[1:13:19] you know he's got to have his girlfriend
[1:13:21] he he he he he tunnel under the fence
[1:13:24] and trips been at my house three times I
[1:13:26] think trying to fix that fence and he
[1:13:28] just the dog just won't he won't let it
[1:13:30] alone he'll dig through the Rock and
[1:13:32] finally they got the fence all fixed up
[1:13:35] and and they thought well he can't get
[1:13:36] out now and Esther caught him climbing
[1:13:38] over the
[1:13:40] top he never did that
[1:13:42] before but what was he trying to be
[1:13:46] happy skip just wants to be happy he's
[1:13:49] trying to get out of his pin and don't
[1:13:51] realiz got everything he ever needs all
[1:13:54] he's doing is making his life
[1:13:57] worse right cuz cuz that just ain't
[1:14:00] going to happen he's going to end up
[1:14:01] with a visit to the
[1:14:04] vet right but you know that he's just
[1:14:07] making it worse on himself see getting
[1:14:09] and if he got it you know it'd be like
[1:14:12] well then it just he'd want more and
[1:14:13] more and more and see that's just the
[1:14:15] way we are as human beings isn't it
[1:14:17] right well if I had a girlfriend if I
[1:14:19] had a boyfriend if I had a better house
[1:14:21] if I had a better car if I had more
[1:14:23] money if I could just get the perfect
[1:14:27] job then you find out the perfect job
[1:14:29] doesn't
[1:14:31] exist if my wife was gone if my husband
[1:14:34] was gone no one say Amen to
[1:14:38] that oh I'd be happy then but none of
[1:14:42] those things will fill the hole in your
[1:14:44] heart right so you got a hole in your
[1:14:47] heart yeah and you you can't blame that
[1:14:50] hole on
[1:14:51] anybody right you can't you you can't
[1:14:53] fill it with just anything
[1:14:56] thing oh my look at Solomon when he
[1:14:59] wrote
[1:15:00] Ecclesiastes Solomon was should have
[1:15:03] been the happiest man on Earth he had
[1:15:06] everything he had a thousand wives maybe
[1:15:11] that's the source of his
[1:15:13] unhappiness but he was he should have
[1:15:16] been a happy he could have had whatever
[1:15:18] whatever Soloman desired was at his
[1:15:20] fingertips look how he puts it in
[1:15:21] Ecclesiastes chapter 2 I said in my
[1:15:24] heart go to now I will prove thee with
[1:15:27] mirth therefore enjoy pleasure behold
[1:15:32] this also is
[1:15:33] Vanity his life was one long Caribbean
[1:15:39] vacation right that's all he did was
[1:15:42] just take a vacation and he and he and
[1:15:45] he had his wives and he had his wine and
[1:15:47] he had his he had all the things he
[1:15:49] could ever want his beautiful
[1:15:51] home and I said of laughter is mad
[1:15:55] or in other words it's crazy and a mirth
[1:15:57] what doth
[1:15:58] it I sought in my heart to give myself
[1:16:01] to Wine yet ainting my heart with wisdom
[1:16:04] and to lay hold on Folly till I might
[1:16:06] see what was good for the sons of men
[1:16:08] which they should do Under the heaven
[1:16:10] all the days of their life I made me
[1:16:11] great works I builded me houses I
[1:16:13] planted me Vineyards I made me Gardens
[1:16:15] and Orchards I planted trees in them of
[1:16:18] all kind of fruits I made me pools of
[1:16:21] water to water there with the wood that
[1:16:23] bringeth forth trees he he irrigated his
[1:16:26] Gardens I got me servants and maidens
[1:16:28] and had servants born in my house also I
[1:16:30] had great possessions of small great and
[1:16:32] small cattle and above all that were in
[1:16:34] Jerusalem before me I gathered me also
[1:16:37] silver and gold and the peculiar
[1:16:39] Treasure of kings and of the provinces I
[1:16:41] got me men singers and women singers and
[1:16:43] the Delights of the sons of men as
[1:16:45] musical instruments and that of All
[1:16:47] Sorts so I was great and increase more
[1:16:50] than all that were before me in
[1:16:52] Jerusalem also my wisdom remained with
[1:16:55] me the gift of discernment that he had
[1:16:58] was still with him right he had all of
[1:17:01] that plus the gift of
[1:17:02] discernment still had wisdom okay you'd
[1:17:05] think he'd be
[1:17:07] happy but he still just couldn't find
[1:17:11] the wherewithal to to be happy yeah you
[1:17:14] realize Solomon was maybe the richest
[1:17:16] man that ever
[1:17:18] lived he he may have been the richest
[1:17:21] man that ever lived if you take the
[1:17:22] things that the Bible says that he had
[1:17:24] and you up monetary value he may well
[1:17:27] have been the richest man that ever
[1:17:30] lived and yet he said I whatsoever my
[1:17:33] eyes desired I kept not from them you
[1:17:36] see what he's doing anything he wants he
[1:17:38] takes it I withheld not my heart from
[1:17:41] any Joy my heart rejoiced in all my
[1:17:43] labor and this was my portion of all my
[1:17:45] labor he said I just did the work that I
[1:17:48] wanted to do you realize he had
[1:17:50] self-care down that's a a word a phrase
[1:17:53] we hear now self-care you need to treat
[1:17:56] yourself right and I I agree you do need
[1:17:58] to treat yourself right but after you've
[1:18:00] treated everybody else
[1:18:02] right right everybody else comes first
[1:18:04] first God and then everybody else and
[1:18:07] finally me at the bottom and that's that
[1:18:10] to me that's what the scripture teaches
[1:18:12] but yet that's what Jesus did when he
[1:18:14] was here yet he he said I wanted to be
[1:18:16] happy so I did whatever I wanted to do I
[1:18:18] looked on all the works that my hands
[1:18:19] had wrought on the labor that I labored
[1:18:21] to do behold all someone say all
[1:18:25] was vanity and vexation of spirit there
[1:18:29] was no
[1:18:30] profit Under the
[1:18:32] Sun Solomon proved that things won't
[1:18:36] make you
[1:18:38] happy people won't make you happy more
[1:18:42] money won't make you happy you were made
[1:18:45] for more than
[1:18:47] that amen see the Bible tells us in
[1:18:50] Hebrews 13:5 let your conversation let
[1:18:52] your manner of Life be without
[1:18:55] covetousness in other words wanting what
[1:18:56] other people have be content with such
[1:18:59] things as you have for he has said I
[1:19:03] will never leave thee nor forsake thee
[1:19:05] aren't you glad for that promise today
[1:19:08] brother brand said I've had the
[1:19:09] privilege of being in King's palaces
[1:19:11] from that to the lowest haunt on skidrow
[1:19:13] and I've never seen a contented sinner
[1:19:15] in my life that's right there's no
[1:19:17] happiness or contentment outside of
[1:19:20] Jesus Christ I've seen them so rich till
[1:19:22] they had bodyguards with them I seen
[1:19:24] them so poor till they beg for a drink
[1:19:26] of whiskey and from the one to the other
[1:19:29] there's no satisfaction in
[1:19:32] sin you see but brother man how can I be
[1:19:34] happy well the last time that human
[1:19:36] beings were happy all the time was in
[1:19:38] the Garden of
[1:19:40] Eden what changed that sin came in right
[1:19:44] right when they started trying to make
[1:19:47] themselves happy that's when they become
[1:19:51] miserable because sin came in and took
[1:19:54] over over yeah listen since then we've
[1:19:57] been unhappy but I believe today and I
[1:20:00] want you to understand this that
[1:20:02] sometimes God even uses that unhappiness
[1:20:05] to draw us to
[1:20:07] him he uses that moment of sorrow and
[1:20:10] that time when we're living Psalms 88 he
[1:20:13] uses that to just draw us closer to him
[1:20:16] right because we could never appreciate
[1:20:19] the the good times without the bad times
[1:20:21] we can never appreciate heaven without
[1:20:23] having to live here
[1:20:26] what do we do sometimes we feel like
[1:20:27] Paul oh Wretched Man that I am who shall
[1:20:31] deliver me from the body of this death
[1:20:33] but I'm so glad he followed that up and
[1:20:35] he said I thank God through Jesus Christ
[1:20:37] Our Lord we may struggle we may have
[1:20:40] trials we may suffer in our
[1:20:42] bodies but brother Brandon says but in
[1:20:44] the but in the depths of our heart yeah
[1:20:47] there lays
[1:20:50] happiness it's there
[1:20:53] somewhere somewhere in the depths of
[1:20:55] your heart there lays happiness because
[1:20:57] that we know that we are absolutely
[1:20:59] someone say absolutely we are absolutely
[1:21:03] secure in Christ
[1:21:06] Jesus
[1:21:07] Hallelujah listen when Jehovah wrapped
[1:21:10] himself in flesh and came down to earth
[1:21:12] he came as a suffering servant he was
[1:21:14] born into poverty rumors swirled about
[1:21:17] who his father was he must have stuck
[1:21:20] out like a sore thumb because he was a
[1:21:21] teenager that did no sin
[1:21:25] so he must have been different from all
[1:21:26] the
[1:21:27] rest I see that amen sign back
[1:21:32] there as an adult he never had a
[1:21:36] house he was literally
[1:21:38] homeless cuz he said the foxes have
[1:21:41] holes and the birds of the air have Nest
[1:21:43] but the son of man hath not where to lay
[1:21:44] his head he had to send Peter fishing to
[1:21:47] pay his taxes I'm almost to that point
[1:21:51] myself he walked everywhere he went
[1:21:55] he had to borrow a donkey so the
[1:21:56] scripture could be
[1:21:58] fulfilled right he only had one set of
[1:22:00] clothes never owned a
[1:22:04] suitcase right and I get to look in the
[1:22:06] mind sometimes say that's about needs to
[1:22:07] be replaced it's been to Africa it's
[1:22:09] been to the Philippines it's it's been
[1:22:11] been to Africa twice been to the
[1:22:12] Philippines been uh to Egypt and it's
[1:22:15] just about it's about done I need to go
[1:22:17] replace it with a nicer one Jesus never
[1:22:19] even had
[1:22:22] one listen the Bible say says he's
[1:22:24] despised and rejected of men a Man of
[1:22:27] Sorrows in accord with grief and we hid
[1:22:29] as it were our faces from him he was
[1:22:31] despised and we esteemed him not yeah
[1:22:34] surely he has borne our griefs and
[1:22:35] carried our sorrows yet we did esteem
[1:22:37] him stricken smitten of God and
[1:22:41] Afflicted the brand said the king of
[1:22:43] glory came down and tabernacled among
[1:22:45] men from the ivory palaces to take upon
[1:22:48] himself not the form of angels but a
[1:22:50] servant of man right clothed in humility
[1:22:54] wandered about no place to lay his head
[1:22:56] slept wherever he could scorned by the
[1:22:59] ones that he loved and was made finally
[1:23:01] a bleeding sacrifice but he pleased the
[1:23:03] father in so much he said this is my
[1:23:06] beloved Son hear ye him oh that's what I
[1:23:09] want to do I want to please the father
[1:23:11] don't you yes that's the way to be happy
[1:23:15] see the Bible says all that will live
[1:23:16] Godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer
[1:23:18] persecution we look at the Old Testament
[1:23:20] Saints Hebrews 11:37 it says they were
[1:23:22] stoned they were saw ther they were
[1:23:24] tempted they were slain with the sword
[1:23:26] they wandered about in sheep skin and
[1:23:28] goat skin being destitute I don't know
[1:23:30] which of those would stink more you know
[1:23:32] but that's what they had to wear being
[1:23:34] destitute Afflicted
[1:23:36] tormented of whom the world was not
[1:23:39] worthy see today we look up to the to
[1:23:42] the successful Ministries to the people
[1:23:44] with lots of an aura of success around
[1:23:47] them an aura of wealth but that's not
[1:23:49] what they were they were men who no one
[1:23:53] would listen to they were men like Noah
[1:23:55] who preached for a hundred years and
[1:23:57] nobody got converted except his own
[1:24:00] family even one of them was a was a
[1:24:03] devil right you you you you realize that
[1:24:06] that that these men were men that had to
[1:24:09] stand even though nothing seemed to go
[1:24:11] right for them Abraham waited 25 years
[1:24:14] for the promise of a baby 25 years
[1:24:17] that's after he was given the promise
[1:24:19] yeah they were already decades into
[1:24:22] their marriage
[1:24:24] when they first started
[1:24:26] waiting but the world's not worthy of
[1:24:29] Abraham the world's not worthy of these
[1:24:31] others all right why brother BR said
[1:24:34] sometimes I wonder what Christianity
[1:24:35] expects today a preacher going to a town
[1:24:38] has to some new church or some new
[1:24:39] charge calls himself a prophet walks up
[1:24:42] there and says well if they'll give me
[1:24:43] so much money if I can have the best car
[1:24:46] if my salary will be raised every six
[1:24:47] months we have to have the best we have
[1:24:49] to have the best homes we have to have
[1:24:51] the best clothes what will we do and we
[1:24:53] stand in the presence of those men
[1:24:54] wandered in Goat skins and sheep skins
[1:24:56] no place to lay their heads wandering
[1:24:58] about in deserts and somebody can make
[1:25:01] fun of us and we're ready to quit church
[1:25:02] and not go back anymore he said what
[1:25:05] Christianity requires today we ought to
[1:25:07] be ashamed of ourselves oh God he said
[1:25:09] be merciful to us
[1:25:11] yes I don't have a problem with you
[1:25:14] having a nice house or a nice car or I
[1:25:16] don't have a problem with myself having
[1:25:17] one I'll say this we shouldn't go we we
[1:25:21] shouldn't spend our whole lives looking
[1:25:23] for that
[1:25:25] I don't believe we should necessarily
[1:25:26] overextend ourselves in debt to get it
[1:25:29] either because what what are we doing
[1:25:31] we're just pushing it down the
[1:25:33] road right and if we're not careful
[1:25:36] we're looking at the wrong things say
[1:25:38] well if I could just be like so and so
[1:25:40] but you don't know what so and so's like
[1:25:41] in the in the
[1:25:43] dark without the lights
[1:25:46] on some of these influencers let me give
[1:25:49] you a tip about social media you young
[1:25:51] people I hope you're not on social media
[1:25:53] yet but if you are I'll say let me give
[1:25:55] you a tip about that if you're if you
[1:25:58] look at social media especially like
[1:25:59] Instagram and Tik Tok you realize most
[1:26:01] of those accounts are
[1:26:03] fake I just found out that something
[1:26:06] that was a funny little video that we I
[1:26:08] just found out it was fake the other day
[1:26:10] it was something we had laughed about
[1:26:11] and quoted and stuff and the whole thing
[1:26:12] was made
[1:26:15] up and it's like Joe I was like what you
[1:26:20] know here people are trying to be that
[1:26:22] and trying to live like that and trying
[1:26:24] to do that if you watch people fish on
[1:26:26] Instagram you'll never go fishing again
[1:26:27] in your
[1:26:29] life fishing don't work like
[1:26:31] that come on church I you got real quiet
[1:26:35] but I know you watch stuff like that I
[1:26:37] some of y'all send me stuff so I
[1:26:41] know but what what what is going on what
[1:26:44] what is it it's a fake many times
[1:26:48] usually it it at least obscures the
[1:26:51] truth but what did Jesus do
[1:26:54] with all the suffering he went through
[1:26:57] now watch we suffer but we suffer with
[1:27:00] purpose we go through valleys but
[1:27:03] there's a mountain on the other
[1:27:04] side now look in Psalms 8814 let's read
[1:27:09] that again he said Lord why castest thou
[1:27:11] off my soul why hidest thou thy face
[1:27:13] from me look at the similarity with
[1:27:15] Matthew 27:46 about the 9th hour Jesus
[1:27:18] cried with a loud voice saying Eli Eli
[1:27:21] Lama sa that is to say my God my God why
[1:27:25] hast Thou forsaken me have you ever
[1:27:28] really thought about that he wasn't
[1:27:31] saying that because well I got to say
[1:27:33] this to fulfill the scripture no it was
[1:27:35] rinsed out of his life that's right it
[1:27:39] it was pulled from him what was it it
[1:27:42] was his Humanity
[1:27:44] speaking right right because God had
[1:27:47] forsaken him he said he would never
[1:27:49] leave
[1:27:52] us but yet he he forsook him on the
[1:27:55] cross we know that he had to pay the
[1:27:57] penalty of sin which was more than just
[1:27:59] getting a a nail drove through your hand
[1:28:02] but it was the
[1:28:03] separation for the first time in his
[1:28:05] life he felt distant from the
[1:28:09] father and he never did anything to
[1:28:11] cause it and he cried out my God my God
[1:28:15] why hast Thou forsaken me and that was
[1:28:20] not a sin right sir think about about it
[1:28:24] for a minute it he was not sinning
[1:28:27] that's right because he was discouraged
[1:28:30] right he did not sin because he asked
[1:28:33] God take this cup from
[1:28:35] me if it's possible and see so many
[1:28:38] times we beat ourselves up say well if I
[1:28:40] was a real Christian I wouldn't have
[1:28:41] talked like that I wouldn't have been
[1:28:42] that negative I wouldn't no he was not
[1:28:44] sinning when he was a human right right
[1:28:48] but he said nevertheless not my will but
[1:28:50] thine be done yes sir see it's when we
[1:28:52] try to escape it's when we try to go the
[1:28:54] wrong way it's when we quit church and
[1:28:56] decide we're just going to go out and be
[1:28:58] happy with the world that's when we
[1:28:59] begin to mess
[1:29:02] up he went ahead and did what God called
[1:29:04] him to do
[1:29:05] look brother beny was a man when he died
[1:29:08] on Calvary for a sacrificed bleeding the
[1:29:10] blood running out of him like a
[1:29:12] mortal spit hanging all over his beard
[1:29:15] he was a man disgrace standing there
[1:29:17] hanging in shame taking our place he was
[1:29:19] a man when the pains got so great till
[1:29:21] he cried my God my God why has s for for
[1:29:24] Aken me that was a man there but when he
[1:29:26] rose up on Easter morning he proved he
[1:29:29] was more than a
[1:29:30] man glory to God there was a grave but
[1:29:33] there was also a
[1:29:35] resurrection there was a Friday
[1:29:37] afternoon when it seemed like so dark
[1:29:40] when even the Sun blotted out but yet
[1:29:42] there was also a Easter Sunday morning
[1:29:45] right amen what made him faithful to the
[1:29:49] Cross but now go back to Psalm 88 what
[1:29:51] made hmon why was he faithful to prayer
[1:29:54] remember what he said in the morning my
[1:29:56] prayer will prevent thee he said I cry
[1:29:58] out daily to you why does he keep on
[1:30:00] going why does he keep on praying why
[1:30:02] does he keep on coming to church why
[1:30:04] does he keep doing that it must have
[1:30:06] been difficult but the but the
[1:30:09] faithfulness of of hmon speaks of the
[1:30:12] faithfulness of Christ who was faithful
[1:30:14] to the cross and the Bible says
[1:30:16] wherefore seeing we also are compassed
[1:30:18] about with so great a cloud of witnesses
[1:30:21] let us lay aside every way and the sin
[1:30:23] which th so easily beset us let us run
[1:30:26] with patience the race that is set
[1:30:28] before us looking unto Jesus the author
[1:30:31] and finisher of our faith who for the
[1:30:34] joy that was set before him is called
[1:30:38] delayed
[1:30:40] gratification right he could have had
[1:30:42] instant gratification and come down off
[1:30:44] the cross but he didn't do it because he
[1:30:47] was willing to delay his happiness for a
[1:30:51] future
[1:30:52] time oh Hallelujah right look listen he
[1:30:56] said he for the joy that was set before
[1:30:57] him endured the cross despising the
[1:30:59] shame and is sat down at the right hand
[1:31:02] of the Throne of God he recognized this
[1:31:05] Darkness was temporary the whole that
[1:31:08] was in his heart now look he had a hole
[1:31:11] in his heart just like you have a hole
[1:31:13] in yours and it's for the same thing he
[1:31:17] only ever prayed one prayer to the
[1:31:19] father you only ever asked for one thing
[1:31:20] rather what was it your fellowship all
[1:31:23] right that's the only thing he ever
[1:31:25] asked for he had a hole in his heart and
[1:31:28] there was only one way to have it filled
[1:31:31] that's to pay the penalty himself aren't
[1:31:33] you glad that he
[1:31:34] did oh my and so he was willing to in
[1:31:37] order to fellowship with you he was
[1:31:39] willing to go and die on the cross so
[1:31:42] that hole that emptiness could be
[1:31:45] filled our temporary unhappiness and
[1:31:47] spite of all that we have reminds us
[1:31:51] there is a place in our lives that only
[1:31:53] he can
[1:31:57] think about
[1:31:58] it Psalm 42:1 as the heart panth after
[1:32:01] the water Brooks so panth my soul after
[1:32:04] thee Oh God my soul thirsteth for God
[1:32:07] for the Living God When shall I come and
[1:32:09] appear before God you see there was a
[1:32:11] hole in David's heart he said I'm like a
[1:32:14] deer that's been wounded and I'm I got
[1:32:16] to get the water that's the way I feel
[1:32:19] about being in your presence Lord my
[1:32:22] soul thirst for God for the Living God
[1:32:25] When shall I come and appear before we
[1:32:26] got to present a living God if you don't
[1:32:28] present your young people a living God
[1:32:30] they'll begin to run after every other
[1:32:32] thing they begin to run after every
[1:32:34] satisfaction every every little bit of
[1:32:36] happiness the world can afford them why
[1:32:38] because they don't see a living God oh I
[1:32:41] pray we would present to our children a
[1:32:43] living God he's still the same yesterday
[1:32:45] today and forever he still raises the
[1:32:47] dead heals the sick cleanses the leper
[1:32:50] changes lives there's still joy in the
[1:32:53] house of God right amen it's a blessed
[1:32:57] thing to thirst for God Jesus said
[1:32:59] blessed are they which do
[1:33:01] hunger and thirst after
[1:33:04] righteousness they shall be filled
[1:33:07] brother Braham teaches us that in
[1:33:09] thirsting for life and other thirst
[1:33:10] other sermons like that why do people
[1:33:13] smoke and drink and run around with
[1:33:14] women they're thirsty they're un they're
[1:33:17] unhappy that thirst is an an unhappiness
[1:33:20] is a thirst it's the
[1:33:22] desire Satan's trying to fill it with
[1:33:24] other
[1:33:25] things God made a way of Escape he said
[1:33:27] but they just won't take
[1:33:29] it what makes people do that because God
[1:33:32] made a man to thirst how dare any man
[1:33:35] try to satisfy that Holy thirst with the
[1:33:37] things of the devil don't you try to do
[1:33:39] that you'll never be satisfied it only
[1:33:41] brings heartaches makes you take a
[1:33:43] pistol and blow your brains out he said
[1:33:44] that don't have real life in it real
[1:33:46] life comes from God you can never be
[1:33:49] satisfied he said imp perfectly happy he
[1:33:52] said one of these half Christian
[1:33:54] supposed to be is the most miserable
[1:33:56] person in the
[1:33:58] world oh my more miserable than the
[1:34:02] sinner is the Halfway Christian that's
[1:34:05] never really committed himself to God he
[1:34:07] said oh I can't do this if my church
[1:34:09] knew I did that God knows you're doing
[1:34:11] it what difference does it make right
[1:34:15] there have your whole heart centered
[1:34:17] right on God and stay right with it you
[1:34:19] want to be happy he's telling you how to
[1:34:20] be happy stay right with it then you're
[1:34:23] happy walking peacefully with him how
[1:34:26] can I be happy how can I feel the whole
[1:34:28] that's in my heart find
[1:34:30] him he he died the death that he died to
[1:34:35] have us so he could be with us to
[1:34:37] fellowship with us and you and I to be
[1:34:40] happy we got to find him job said if I
[1:34:43] could just find him but he's here today
[1:34:45] in the form of the Holy Ghost he's here
[1:34:47] all you got to do is find him amen he
[1:34:50] said brother Ben that's simplistic that
[1:34:51] doesn't factor in my needs you realize
[1:34:54] it's the devil telling you that that's
[1:34:56] right he is the answer to all of our
[1:35:02] needs how can I be happy find him see
[1:35:05] you are his Joy did you know that you
[1:35:08] are the joy set before him fellowship
[1:35:12] with you is the happiness that he
[1:35:15] sought oh my if you're his Joy why don't
[1:35:18] you let him be
[1:35:20] yours why don't I let him be mine that's
[1:35:23] how be happy Luke 6 and 20 he lifted up
[1:35:27] his eyes on his disciples and said
[1:35:28] Blessed Be you poor for yours is the
[1:35:30] kingdom of God blessed are you that
[1:35:32] hunger now you shall be filled blessed
[1:35:35] are you that weep now for you shall
[1:35:36] laugh blessed are you when men shall
[1:35:38] hate you when they shall separate you
[1:35:40] from their company shall reproach you
[1:35:43] cast out your name as evil for the son
[1:35:45] of man's sake what does it sound like
[1:35:46] Psalms
[1:35:49] 88 Rejoice ye in that day yeah and leap
[1:35:54] for
[1:35:55] Joy other words he said if you're being
[1:35:58] persecuted you ought to be jumping in
[1:35:59] the house of
[1:36:01] God can you imagine somebody coming I
[1:36:04] know we're human beings right when we
[1:36:06] get healed we want to and God's still a
[1:36:08] Healer you believe that we ought to
[1:36:09] praise him for our healing but when we
[1:36:11] get healed we want to come in and and
[1:36:13] we're excited we're happy when we have a
[1:36:16] particularly good service when we get a
[1:36:18] revelation about the word something good
[1:36:20] happens to us or we get a good job or
[1:36:22] we're happy we're going to come to
[1:36:23] church and jump for joy I'm afraid to
[1:36:25] jump afraid I break the
[1:36:27] concrete but I bounce a little
[1:36:30] bit but you know that's what we're
[1:36:33] that's what we we we we do we tend to
[1:36:35] jump for joy but what did he say when
[1:36:37] the last time you had somebody come to
[1:36:38] church and say oh praise God I'm so
[1:36:40] happy
[1:36:41] today thank the Lord what happened
[1:36:44] brother what did you get get a new job
[1:36:45] did you get a new
[1:36:47] wife what happened to you no brother I
[1:36:50] got persecuted
[1:36:52] today today they called me
[1:36:55] names today they cast me out of their
[1:36:57] company and the scripture says when that
[1:37:00] happens to me to leap for
[1:37:03] Joy I think we'd have
[1:37:09] church are you with me now you can't do
[1:37:13] that outside of Christ hum The Human
[1:37:16] Condition that doesn't allow us to do
[1:37:18] that right outside of the spirit of
[1:37:20] God said but W to you are that are rich
[1:37:23] for you received your consolation other
[1:37:24] words you got what you wanted here you
[1:37:27] got everything you wanted but remember
[1:37:30] there's something in across the veil
[1:37:33] that's more real than this see Leia
[1:37:37] think they Rich have I got five more
[1:37:38] minutes I don't want to take up all your
[1:37:39] time tonight Lea thinks they're rich so
[1:37:43] there's no future joy to look forward
[1:37:45] to right they say I'm rich I'm increase
[1:37:47] with Goods I have need of nothing and
[1:37:51] Jesus is outside the door
[1:37:54] come
[1:37:58] on I want in come on now and they don't
[1:38:01] even hear it because they're they're
[1:38:04] rich what do they have need of what
[1:38:07] could he possibly offer them that they
[1:38:10] don't
[1:38:11] have see I think today we need to
[1:38:14] understand we we may be poor I think all
[1:38:15] of us are poor by lab seeing standards
[1:38:19] just by nature of where we live
[1:38:21] probably but we're rich compared to
[1:38:24] other people in the
[1:38:25] world but we may be poor by latery and
[1:38:27] standards but I want to testify tonight
[1:38:30] that I found the one who makes me Rich I
[1:38:34] found the one who gives me water I found
[1:38:37] the one who makes me happy I found the
[1:38:39] one can you testify to that tonight I

[1:39:09] it could have talked back I just said
[1:39:11] little Brooke why are you bubbling so he
[1:39:13] said is it because the animals drink

[1:39:33] inside I can't hold it it has to bubble
[1:39:35] out and even when I'm in my darkest
[1:39:37] moments I still
[1:39:41] pray there's something to be said for
[1:39:43] that church even when I'm hurting in the
[1:39:46] worst moment of my life I still
[1:39:50] pray there's something bubbling inside I
[1:39:52] can't hold it it has to bubble out sir
[1:39:55] and every man that's born of the spirit
[1:39:56] of God has the inexhaustible Fountain of
[1:39:59] Christ inside that's bubbling out just
[1:40:02] something that you can't hold your peace
[1:40:04] why are you happy in church on a
[1:40:06] Wednesday night I I believe you're happy
[1:40:08] you may not have discovered your
[1:40:09] happiness but deep down on the inside of
[1:40:12] your heart it's
[1:40:15] there the house of the Lord Brother B
[1:40:17] say is the joy of the Lord all right
[1:40:19] this is where we fellowship with one
[1:40:21] another yeah and with him yeah now we
[1:40:24] fellowship with him every day but we
[1:40:25] take this time aside and it's very
[1:40:28] special because we're focused on him
[1:40:31] we're not thinking about everything else
[1:40:32] we're focused on him and he just must he
[1:40:34] must just love that because that was the
[1:40:37] joy that was set before him is to be
[1:40:40] able to come in the cool of the evening
[1:40:41] that's what he was missing brother Paul
[1:40:43] he wanted to come back down he was
[1:40:45] coming down to find Adam to have church
[1:40:47] with him again so he get have church
[1:40:50] with him again he was going to come in
[1:40:51] the cool of the evening under the trees
[1:40:53] and talked to Adam and Adam hid
[1:40:57] himself made made goat skins or or made
[1:41:00] fig leaves and put on him and tried to
[1:41:02] cover himself and he said Adam Adam
[1:41:05] Where Art Thou what was he doing it was
[1:41:07] the Cry Of God it was that that hole
[1:41:10] that he had to feel he wanted to be in
[1:41:11] church with you don't you realize that
[1:41:13] the church he said that the house of the
[1:41:15] Lord is the joy of the Lord the joy of
[1:41:18] the Lord is the joy of his people he
[1:41:20] wants you to come to church and worship
[1:41:22] him and be happy and satisfied giving
[1:41:25] praise and honor and glory and wisdom
[1:41:27] and might and power to God he wants you
[1:41:29] to do that oh can we do that tonight he
[1:41:33] wants us to do that that's what he wants
[1:41:35] he said but I've been through so much
[1:41:37] for the man but that's the one he really
[1:41:38] wants to hear from yes that's the one it
[1:41:42] must have been precious to him every
[1:41:44] time hymon would would would begin to
[1:41:45] pray and cry out to God it must have
[1:41:47] been precious to Jehovah because he knew
[1:41:50] how much he'd been through yeah but he
[1:41:53] waited because there was something he
[1:41:54] was doing in his life yes oh
[1:41:59] my there's nothing spiritual about being
[1:42:02] miserable right when we are
[1:42:06] miserable it's because many times we're
[1:42:09] in our
[1:42:11] humanity and and that's not
[1:42:14] sin that's not sin you got to take some
[1:42:18] time sometimes you got to take a break
[1:42:20] sometimes you got to step back I'm not
[1:42:21] saying from church or the things of God
[1:42:23] God because that's your spiritual side
[1:42:26] sometimes you just got to give yourself
[1:42:27] a little bit of relief and quit standing
[1:42:31] there at the
[1:42:34] grindstone but your real happiness is
[1:42:36] found in
[1:42:39] God nothing
[1:42:41] spiritual about being
[1:42:43] miserable there's nothing spiritual
[1:42:45] about being
[1:42:46] unhappy because what if we really knew
[1:42:49] what he had already done for us how
[1:42:51] could we ever be unhappy
[1:42:54] again you know there'll come a time and
[1:42:56] wipe the tears from our eyes do you know
[1:42:58] that in heaven in at the marriage supper
[1:43:00] the say go down that line wipe the tears
[1:43:02] from our eyes that's what the Bible says
[1:43:04] you'll wipe the tears from our eyes and
[1:43:07] I'm thinking how could we be there
[1:43:09] crying but brother Brandon when he saw
[1:43:11] him beyond the curtain of time I noticed
[1:43:12] a little detail I just listened to the
[1:43:14] sermon he said he was talking about that
[1:43:18] he said they were crying tears of
[1:43:20] joy Hallelujah they were just so happy
[1:43:25] to see brother brandom because they knew
[1:43:27] oh they said our precious brother they
[1:43:29] come in under his ministry they were
[1:43:31] identified with his ministry and so they
[1:43:33] were so happy to see him that they cried
[1:43:34] tears of joy it wasn't tears of Sorrow
[1:43:38] some of you are crying that right now
[1:43:39] tears of joy you know how much he's done
[1:43:41] for you let's be happy in the Lord
[1:43:44] there'll come a day and wipe every tear
[1:43:45] from our eyes we may feel like Psalm 88
[1:43:49] but let's sing to the Lord with joy and
[1:43:52] gladness give him the glory due to his
[1:43:54] name pick up our symbols and play do the

[1:44:18] and to pray
[1:44:24] this is the joy of the
[1:44:26] Lord you fellowshipping with him you
[1:44:29] just put everything aside for just a
[1:44:31] moment everything else let's think about

[1:44:39] but I I'm still here

[1:44:47] knock and it shall be open to you seek
[1:44:50] and you shall find
[1:44:53] the joy of the Lord the psalmist says is
[1:44:55] my
[1:44:57] strength that's a miracle in itself
[1:45:00] because sorrow brings sorrow brings
[1:45:04] weakness but joy brings
[1:45:07] strength and and the to be able to have
[1:45:10] joy and strength within the sorrowful
[1:45:12] moments of our life that's a miracle he
[1:45:14] wants to do that for you would you just

[1:45:48] today we know that our Prophet told us
[1:45:51] that
[1:45:53] Lord that you want us to be
[1:45:56] happy that you didn't want us to be
[1:45:58] miserable you wanted us to play like
[1:46:00] children before the
[1:46:01] father Lord sometimes children get
[1:46:05] hurt or sometimes we live in Psalm 88
[1:46:08] but there's a reason why you allowed
[1:46:09] that to be put there why you inspired
[1:46:12] it Lord we think of inspiration as being
[1:46:15] some great thing but Lord sometimes it
[1:46:17] comes out of the very depths of the
[1:46:19] darkness of the place where we live yet
[1:46:23] it's still
[1:46:24] inspired oh God I pray you'd help us
[1:46:26] today Lord if there's someone struggling
[1:46:29] today I don't know that there is but if
