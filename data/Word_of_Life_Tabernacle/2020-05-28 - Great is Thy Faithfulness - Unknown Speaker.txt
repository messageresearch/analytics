in the house of the Lord on a Wednesday night we're gonna read from lamentations chapter 3 verses 21 through 26 also Deuteronomy chapter 7 verses 7 through 10 lamentations chapter 3 and verse 21 and then Deuteronomy 7 and 7 you believe the Lord wants to speak to you tonight a man I believe that's why we're here is because he wants to speak to his children whose arm is not short but the Bible says that he's able to reach us where we're at him and we can touch the hem of his garment and I'm so grateful for that tonight I'm grateful for the work of the Lord among us I pray that just continue and that we'd continue to feel the presence of the Lord and the services and and just gather together and be one body look we talked about Sunday morning and in coming one Accord in one place and anything can happen amen lamentations chapter 3 and verse 21 this I recall to mind therefore have I hope it is of the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed because his Compassion's fail not aren't you glad for his Compassion's today notice he says they are new every morning so we don't use up the quota of compassion today it'll be new again in the morning they're new every morning great is thy faithfulness he says the Lord is my portion saith my soul therefore will I hope in him the Lord is good unto them that wait for him to the soul that seeketh him it was good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the Lord and then Deuteronomy 7 and 7 the Lord did not set his love upon you nor choose you because you were more in number than any people for you were the fewest of all people but because the Lord loved you and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your father's that the Lord brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you out of the house a bondman from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt know therefore that the LORD thy God He is God the faithful God which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his Commandments to a thousand generations and repay them that hate him to their face to destroy them he will not be slack to him that ate of him he will repay him to his face I pray the Lord without his blessing - the word you may be seated this evening in the 1840s a man of the name of John Getty left his church in Canada and took his wife and two small children to the South Sea Islands to begin a mission work there they went more than 20,000 miles over land and sea and they arrived in the new head reduce Islands was an island chain full of cannibals and just a few months before 20 members of a British ship had been killed and eaten just a few months prior to their arrival on the mission field they faced the difficulty of learning a language that had no written form the constant threat of being killed slowly at first a few converts came and then soon many more began to receive the gospel over the years Getty translated the entire Bible into their native language and planted 25 churches many of those years he never heard from home never got a penny for his Labor's but he pastored a church there for many years and there's a plaque there in the church today that says this says when he landed in 1848 there were no Christians here and when he left in 1872 there were no heathen now that's the faithfulness of God that God would send a missionary from 20,000 miles away and somehow put it on his heart to go to an island and the South Seas where the people ate each other and I read a travel blog on this because I just wanted but a Caleb to see if it was true and and the story that I had read and I read a travel blog about this that someone had went there recently and she talked about how that they had went into the country and onto those islands and they wanted to see beyond the the tourism of the island and see what it was really like they walked deep into the jungle because the people there had originally been deep in the jungles that's where they lived and as she walked she said I couldn't help but think about the history of those islands and I was curious as to why these people ended up moving out of the jungle and into villages closer to the ocean and she asked her her guide it was a man named Tom a native look that question and he responded by saying the missionaries came and gave us the good news we had to move out of the darkness into the light so they abandoned their gods they abandoned even their homes and and moved and and today it's one of the most Christian societies I guess that there is as far as nominal Christians is in that place because of the faithfulness of God and the faithfulness of a man to follow the will of God those two things go together faithfulness is an attribute of God it's something that God is it's not something God does if something God is he is the faithful God the scripture said it's that it is his trustworthiness that he keeps all of his promises and remains the same every time he is approached so that a prophet of God could tell us that if we come to God with the same attitude as someone else did in the scripture that will receive like they did that even though it's not here in a physical form yet he's here that we can we can touch God we can reach God in a way that would change us that would meet our needs that we can look back and identify ourselves with someone who met God before and we can see we can meet God today because he's the same yesterday today and forever it's his faithfulness I want to look at some ways that God is faithful to us he is faithful with Allen to forgive us first on what an eyes that if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness if we confess he is faithful we come God's provide away and there's no other way to get to it but by repentance there is no way to the new birth but by repentance but if we repent he is faithful he is not giving us something extra but he's being true to his nature it's justwell job being true to his nature to forgive and we are not always faithful to forgive but God is and I'm so grateful for that to cleanse us from all unrighteousness so he's true to that he's also faithful to sanctify us the Bible says in first Thessalonians 5:23 he said the very God of peace sanctify you wholly and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless until the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ so we don't have to live like the world he's faithful to sanctify us he said faithful is he that calleth you who also will do it the same God that calls you since the word to cleanse you by the washing of the water of the word so he's faithful to sanctify as he's faithful to keep us in Hebrews 10:23 he said let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promised Amen so he says let's hold on to what we have because he is faithful not because we are faithful but because he is faithful and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works so this is part of abiding in his faithfulness is to consider one another to provoke one another to love into good works not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is I wonder what he would say today the manner of some is but exhorting one another exhorting one another and so much the more as you see the Day approaching he's faithful we are tempted first Corinthians 10 and 13 says there's no temptation taken you but such as is common to man he said but God is faithful will not suffer you to be tempted above what you're able so grateful for this but will with the temptation also make a way to escape that you may be able to bear it if you go back to the original Greek on this first Paul paints a vivid Word picture that it's as if he will not drop you in the ocean so far from land that you can't swim to it he will not put you in a place where if you're willing to swim that you'll be able to get to make land oh I'm so grateful for that and so if God put John Getty on those islands he would not put him in a place where he couldn't make it if he was faithful and so he's faithful in temptation he's faithful in second Thessalonians three and three he is faithful to protect us says but the Lord is faithful who shall establish you and keep you from evil we ought to remember that on these times of viruses and things going around he said he's faithful to protect us he's faithful to establish you to keep you from evil and as I'm looking at these things so I realized that and I won't hold you long tonight so you just have to listen fast but I realized that it is not just his faithfulness but as children of God we have to be faithful as he is faithful it's not so much faithfulness that's born in us although there is that and we'll see that in a natural way but as he is faithful we take on the image of that faithfulness we bear his we are faithful if he is faithful we see that and we become faithful like he is so faithfulness is not just an attribute of God but it's something you see with the Harve around the children of God it is a mark of a son of God or a daughter of God that they're found faithful the Jews when they talked about faithfulness believed that a man could you could understand God's faithfulness by looking at God's people and they taught told a story about how there was a rabbi who dwelt in a certain city and some men came by who had two measures of barley and they wanted him to preserve it for them and afterwards they forgot about it in the window and every year the rabbi took the barley and didn't just keep it but he sewed it and he reaped it and he thrashed it and he laid it up in his granary he did this for seven years and finally the men remembered we list some barley at the rabbi's house and they come by to get it and when they did they didn't get just the barley that they left but they got the barley they left plus seven years worth of increase that's faithfulness and they said let us take our treasure and with all that had produced for seven years and the Jews said this they said dust from the faithfulness of man you may know the faithfulness of God well Jesus talks about that how that how that the one servant hid his his talent in the dirt but there was another who went out and got ten other towns five other tell us whatever that it was and brought it with him what was it it's faithfulness faithfulness to not just not just keep what God gives us but to actually increase on that now I want to go to a story in the Bible tonight and this is probably not normal preaching for me but Lords been leading me just in different ways it seems like and I can tell that you're praying and just really seeking the mind of the Lord because the Lord has been taking me in a little bit different directions every week and I like that I liked when you don't have to struggle to know what to preach but we were I was thinking of the story of Eli in the Bible and that may not seem like a story of faithfulness but just hang on for a moment you I was the high priest in Israel before the time of the prophet Samuel and he was a descendant of Aaron's fourth son it's the mark and you I had two sons main hophni and Phinehas and you I was a faithful priest he did everything that he should except for work come to his sons now the Bible tells us in 1st Samuel 2 and 12 that the sons of Eli were sons of Belial and if you go but the Bruce looked that up it literally means they were worthless they were just worthless so he had to two kids that were in the ministry followed the family business but they were worthless since they knew not the Lord who god help us and I've said this before and it's not director than anyone here because we have wonderful ministry but but if you're not saved don't try to preach I just feel in general because you really mess things up if you don't have the Holy Ghost it's not a good time to be preaching to others if you haven't settled whether you believe the message or not you don't need to be preaching to someone else that needs to be settled and these young men didn't know the Lord and the Bible if you go down you can read it at home to save time but we find that these men mishandled the priests portion that was supposed to be given just a portion of the sacrifice and they mishandled that they took more than their share and didn't properly care for the people so much so that in 1st Samuel 2:17 it says wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the Lord four men aboard the offering of the Lord in other words there were people who would no longer come to make a sacrifice because of the way that these young men treated the gospel the way you could say it this way the way they handled the word was such that men would no longer come to hear the of the word of the Lord men abhorred the offering of the Lord and the Bible says that that sin was very great because they mishandled God's portion of this applies also to us those that are lay at the end to the clergy don't mishandled portion no mishandle God fortune there's there's a part of your life there's a there's a our income and I would go so far as to say this and especially for us ministers but it's true of all of us were stewards we're given a portion god allows us a certain ability or a certain gift to make money and or to do a certain thing or to to sing or to preach or whatever that it is God gives that to us that ability and we're stewards of that gift and we don't want to miss handle God's portion we don't want to miss handle loss cause if God gives it to me I want to do like the rabbi did I want to show it I want to I want to make sure there's an increase because it comes from God I've told you before but the Darrell Ward who I respect very much and way he's handled himself in the ministry he told me said if you're a ten-cent preacher he said he only give God five cents you Rob God a five cents it's not just a great preacher that would do that they'd say well he could have had a great ministry but even a regular preacher but it applies to us in the laity as well maybe more so in some ways don't miss handle God's portion first Corinthians four and one tells us that he said let a man so account of us as of the ministers of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God stewards of the mysteries of God he said moreover it is required in stewards that a man be found faithful steward would be someone who had said over a man's house and if he's going to be over a man's house every year it's going to give a count for the way he handles the man's business and we are stewards in the way Paul puts it is of the mysteries of God they've been given to us no words and not to others they've been revealed to us and not to others this message has been given to us and not to many other people we understand that we believe it and if we believe it and we understand it were stewards of it we're responsible for the message do we realize that church we're responsible for it it's to us and we realize God is faithful but he'll have faithful children God is faithful but in our faithful ministers God is faithful but they are faithful people sitting in the pews God is faithful but we must be found faithful he is faithful to do all the things that we talked about then if he is faithful he said greatest died faithfulness then if we're gonna protect that deity as we say walk out and speaking to me God's speaking we must be found faithful and I realized on a Wednesday night that I'm completely preaching to the choir preaching on faithfulness on a Wednesday night is just completely preaching to the choir but you know I think it does us good as well because we're accountable for this message when we go to the grocery store were accountable for this message whatever whenever we have a business dealing we're stewards of the mysteries of God and so we can't just do business like everybody else does now and so he said it's required that a man be found faithful in 2nd Timothy 2:2 he speaking to Timothy's that said the things that thou has heard of me among many witnesses the same commit thou to faithful men who shall be able to teach others also so he's saying this faithfulness has got to be handed down from generation to generation if we're stewards of the mysteries of God each generation must be found faithful not just the generation before we can look back and say well so-and-so is faithful that's the reason I believe the message today someone was faithful to preach someone was faithful to get the message out someone today has to be faithful and so 1st corinthians 4 and 17 he says for this cause have I sent unto you timotheus who is my beloved son and faithful in the Lord who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ as I teach everywhere in every church we need to keep that pattern of faithfulness be faithfully taught and teach others faithfully but the sons of Eli didn't do that somehow I did not communicate to them or perhaps he did attempt and do his best he wasn't silent but he didn't do enough in 1st Samuel 2 in 22 it says now Eli was very old and heard all that his sons did into all Israel how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation and he said unto them why do you such thanks for I hear of your evil dealings by all this people nay my sons it is no good report that I hear you make the Lord's people to transgress verse 25 if one man sinned against another the judge shall judge him but if a man sin against the Lord who shall entreat for him notwithstanding they hearkened not unto the voice of their father because the Lord would slay them and we find then that Eli spoke up but he didn't take care of the problem because a man of God came later and rebuked him for it and in verse 29 he said wherefore kick you at my sacrifice than it might offering or did you just treat it like it's nothing why do you kick it why do you treat my offering like you do which I have commanded in my habitation and honors thy sons above me to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my people he was more faithful to his family than he was to God say God help us today God help us today see a man in authority is responsible for those he has authority over and he's responsible not only for what he does but for everything that they do it's true if the buck stops somewhere the buck stops there means you get all the credit and all the blame or maybe more likely none of the credit and all the blame but you do you get it that's where it stops and so that's the way it was with you I am and for Samuel 234 he said this should be a sign unto thee to come upon that two sons on hophni and Phinehas in one day they shall die both of them and I will raise me up with faithful priests that shall do according to that which is in my heart and in my mind I will build him a shirt house and he show up before mine anointed forever now if we're going to it in a moment but you'll find that a man named Zadok fulfilled this and the natural in the Old Testament that he become a priest to David and to Solomon but it was Christ who fulfilled it in the spiritual and I'm so glad that Christ is a faithful priest I'm so glad that our Lord is faithful even when even when I'm not even when you're not he's faithful and he was so faithful that he did everything that his father wanted him to do and he was completely led by his father he said I will raise me up a faithful priest that shall do according to that which you sent my heart and in my mind I will build him a sure house he shall walk before mine anointed for ever and so we find that as I said is a dog fulfilled this from the natural and first grant first Chronicles 24 3 David distributed them he said both say talk to the sons of eleazar and eleazar was was Aaron's second or third son ELISA was Aaron's third son he said in a Himalaya the sons of Islam are that was Aaron's fourth Silas to family trees to lines in the family he said according to their offices in their service so Solomon and then in 1st Kings 2 27 we find that Solomon thrust out a bias are from being preached unto the Lord now a bias are was the next son of Tamar he was the next in the line of descendants rather of is amar and he thrust him out that he might fulfill the word of the Lord when she spake concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh and you'll find that a by authority priest was a co priest was laid off but he fat was found unfaithful in anointing the King that David wanted to have anointed David wanted Solomon to be king that's who God wanted to be king but here abaya thought was unfaithful and went with another son of David so we find out that it was according to the word of the Lord which he spoke concerning the house of Eli he said it won't continue in your house and it says in 1st Kings 2:35 the King put benaiah the son of jr. died in his room over the host and laid off the priests of the King put in the room of a by authority become the high priest and I'm telling you this and because faithful fathers teach their children to be faithful unfaithful fathers teach their children to be unfaithful and I know it comes down a little harsh because you can't do nothing about how you were raised you can't raise yourself right but it is true that there's a constant pattern on down to the scripture that people break those cycles see that faithfulness has got to start somewhere it's got to start somewhere that somebody's gonna be faithful I'm gonna be faithful if my dad was not faithful my mother was not faithful if my if my siblings were not faithful I'm gonna be faithful but yet in life you see that you see a father who's faithful in his business dealings teaches his son to be faithful in business dealings a son or a father or a mother who's faithful in certain areas in the way that they conduct themselves you see the children are faithful in those areas and the same is true of unfaithful fathers unfaithful mothers it's true also faithful pastors unfaithful pastors true faithful deacons unfaithful Deacons faithful you could take it into every office of the church unfaithful people teach other people to be unfaithful and faithful people teach faithfulness we know this is true of Abraham because when God is speaking and he says I want to reveal this thing to Abraham I don't want to hide it from him I don't you want to know the heart of God I believe we have the heart of God revealed in this hour but why did he reveal it to Abraham he said for I know him that he will command his children and his household after him and they shall keep the way of the Lord to do justice and judgments that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that would she has spoken of him so Abraham was faithful to teach his children and so he could begin a generation he was the beginning of that faithfulness and he was called faithful Abraham Aaron was the high priest in the wilderness and his sons were priests as well under Aaron we find remember I said that Eleazar was the third son of Aaron and if Tamar was the fourth the first two of Aaron's sons if you'll remember brought strange fire before the Lord and they were actually consumed and Aaron's other sons and Aaron were not even allowed to grieve for them because they brought strange fire it was such a sin against God if we could only realize that today the way people handle the word it's such a sin against God to handle the word in the wrong way and that goes beyond just preaching false doctrine - but the way in which we handle the word goes to our lives as well if we handle the word with unclean hands it's a great sin against God if we handle the word with an unrepentant heart it's a great sin against God if we handle the word and get into false doctrine is a great sin against God so he said in Moses in Leviticus 1016 now we find that those are those two brought strange fire no he had to others and they displeased the Lord because in that timeframe in Leviticus 1016 that Moses sought diligently to go to the sin offering behold it was barked now he left them instructions said boys whatever you do now remember your brothers just got burn up because they didn't follow instructions he said whatever you do leave take that goat off the fire before it burns up because you got to eat of it so you got to eat that sin-offering that's right and so he said whatever you do take it don't let it burn and guess what Moses starts looking for the goat where's the goat they look diligently for it and I can see Elly easier and it's the mark I shaking in their boots at this point because they left the fire going too long how could you make that mistake after seeing your brother's burn up but maybe it was during that time they were so shook up and just in the confusion of the moment that they failed to be faithful to the offering and Moses got angry about that and he says wherefore have you not eaten the sin offering of the holy place seeing it as must most holy and God has given it to you to bear the iniquity of the congregation to make atonement for them before the Lord said we sure job so you could find then now look those two lines the priests a bias on the side it was in that line of Eli with that had the hophni and Phinehas who are unfaithful in their duties and was taken away from them but also Zadok his father Eleazar was not faithful in his duties either so who you gonna turn to somebody's got to start it somebody's got to stand there and say I'm tired of getting rebuked by Moses every time we turn around just mess this up all the time I'm tired of him having to tell us every time to take the goat off somebody has to discharge the officers of a priest right open no matter how much they tried they could never do it the way God wanted it done why there was one coming there was a faithful high priest who was coming who could be touched by the feeling of our infirmities but now these were unfaithful but this cycle had to be broken somewhere what happened in eleazar's family well he had a son named Finny house Anthony Haase was a man when there was a plague in Israel you all know the story because of the doctrine of Balaam there been the intermarriage had come in and and and finish off season in his zeal he does something about it he's Stephanie he he just isn't willing to let it go on he wants to stop it and because he did something about it and I love the fact there was him and not his dad it was him and not the others it was here not even Moses did anything about it but there was a plague going on and pheenoh house said witch somebody's got to fix this so he does something about and listen to what God spoke to Moses and says about phineas he said the Lord spoken to Moses saying if any hostile son of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest had turned my wrath away from the children of Israel while he was zealous for my sake among them that I consume not the children of Israel in my jealousy our church survived if you could only hear my heart if there'd be somebody that could be like Phinney hosts today that could stand up in our when when the world's gone crazy and when it seems like everybody mishandles the word everybody does things in the wrong way but there could be somebody that could stand up and say it's for me in my house we're gonna serve the Lord s for me we're gonna do this thing right we're gonna love people we're gonna treat people right we're gonna do the right things we're gonna preach the word the way it's written we're gonna stay with the message of the hour why because I don't want to be an unfaithful priest I don't want to be an unfaithful Stewart I want to handle them things that I've been given these mysteries of God with faithful hands somebody's got to do it he said in this hour when people are being lost all around us and people are leaving the message all around us someone has got to stand up and say not me not my generation the plague needs to stop somebody's got to be the reason they read somebody's got to be faithful numbers 25 and 12 he said wherefore say and this was an act of extreme you might say warfare and active violence if you could put it that way that he did but the scripture says in the days of John it says the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence and the violent take it by force and it's a hard scripture to understand but it means that those that are willing to do something those who are willing to be desperate about something those that are willing to stand up and be counted as children of God those are the ones who received the kingdom of heaven and so here someone was jealous for his God he said and he said behold I given to him my covenant of peace because he was willing to stand up because he was willing to go through the fire because he was willing to do what needed to be done he said I'll give him a covenant of peace and he shall have it and his seed after him it meant and Sadek was his seed after him that all these years later the pie priesthood would stay in the line of Islam are until one day God's Word came true and the line there was unfaithful kept being unfaithful but these are started with Finney house became faithful and remained faithful even generations later oh my I think it's time we started faithful generations some of you may be you're part of a faithful generation it's up to us to continue a faithful generation he was zealous for his God so he shall have it in a seat after him even the Covenant of an everlasting priesthood because he was zealous for his God and made an atonement for the children of Israel he broke the cycle and his descendants a dock maid Solomon King somebody is going to see us through there's gonna be somebody's gonna be ministers and lay people in churches that are gonna be present at the time hey man when our Lord returns to earth again if we could put it that way somebody's got to be found faithful he said well I find faith when I return somebody has got to be found faithful in the hour of the end and in order for that to happen somebody's got to break the cycle and begin faithful generations listen Christ had to come no man could be as faithfulness as Christ good God came down in flesh and was tempted so he could be counted as faithful high priest the Bible in Hebrews 2:17 says wherefore in all things it behooves him to be made like unto his brethren that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God to make reconciliation for the sins of the people now look when do we need him the most you know we think about great times and we went to these meetings this last week and just really enjoyed that in the presence of God we had a wonderful service Sunday morning just the presence of God was here but when do we need the mercies of God every morning every morning and see he said he come to be tempted so he could be a faithful high priest that we would know that in the morning he'll be there do you ever think about that in the morning he'll be there when I go to bed at night he'll be there if I mess up he'll be there if I fall he'll be there think about the faithfulness of God for a moment that he is a faithful high priest whenever I need healing he there whether there's a church service or not he's there when I'm down he's there David said if I make my bed in hell behold palette there if I rise up on leaves for the morning behold thou art there I can't go anywhere and lose him he's always with me he's always very faithful he's faithful so much so that he will not do something just to make a temporary thing in my life but he does what's best for me he's faithful and answering my prayers whether he answers from the way I think I should he should or not he still answered my prayers because he's a faithful high priest a faithful high priest in things pertaining to God to make reconciliation for the sins of the people the Bible says he's a faithful witness he says in Revelations 1:5 and from Jesus Christ to his be faithful witness and the first begotten of the Dead and the Prince of the kings of the earth and to him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood what is it he remains faithful to the word and he's a faithful witness he said I died and rose again according to the Word of God he's a faithful witness of the resurrection he's a faithful witness he remains faithful to his word and the Bible says in Revelation chapter 19 verse 11 it said I saw heaven open behold a white horse and he that sat upon him was called faithful hey man what that tells me is he'll be faithful with Isaac to the end to the end he's not gonna be just faithful to brother Brandon's generation and not to mine but when he comes back on a white horse he's still faithful he that said upon him was called faithful and true hey man he stayed true to the word because he was the word and then righteousness he doth judge and make so he's faithful and he comes back like he said he would hey Ben because he's faithful we believe in the literal coming of Christ because we believe he's faithful we believe in a millennial reign of a thousand years because we believe he's faithful to his word we believe that God sent a prophet in Malachi 4 because we believe God was faithful to his word we believe there would come a moment but the David one will change in a moment of twinkling of an eye because he's faithful to his word he's faithful but he's not the only one that's faithful listen to this Revelation chapter 17 and 14 it said these shall make war with the lamb and the lamb shall overcome them for he is Lord of lords King of Kings and they that are with him hey Ben I want to be one of those babe Ellen that are with him are called and we like that we like that we're the cult we have to be called her we can't be with him we are the called only those that are called or ride with him they are called their chosen only those that are chosen will be there with him and faithful faithful well the Brandon says this in the fourth seal and I purposely I could have read many quotes tonight but I purposely just to make this shorter so I wouldn't wear you out on a Wednesday night I purposely kept many of them out but this one I wanted to include he said those with him are in white horses also and they are called hey man the chosen before the foundation of the world and they are faithful to the word he said I like that one hey Ben he said cold chosen before the foundation of the world he said and then faithful to the word by their own choosing every morning when Jesus woke up when he was here on the earth you know what he did he chose to be faithful when the devil come and tempted him and showed him all the all the things that were out there and all the the kingdoms of the earth and said if you'll bow your knee to me how come he chose to be faithful see but he was God he made a choice to be faithful he went down there in the garden and he cried the Lord if it be possible let this cup pass from me but then he said nevertheless not my will be done but yours Lord he chose to be faithful brother Brown said we were called before the foundation of the world were chosen before the foundation of the world but we choose to be faithful I just want to I just want that to sink into our hearts today we choose to be faithful we choose to follow this example of faithfulness faithful to the word by their choosing all stimulated with new wine and all just riding right along coming down to meet him every day you wake up and you have a choice am I gonna be faithful to the word today whether I feel like it or whether I don't there may be an easier path but am I gonna be faithful to the word there may not feel like going to church but am I gonna be faithful are you with me now now I'm not faithful to a pastor I'm not gonna be riding on one of those white horses because I was faithful to a man I'm faithful to the Word of God I'm not gonna I'm not gonna be there because I I followed the footsteps of a prophet but I followed the footsteps of God I was faithful because he is faithful and I saw that example of faithfulness and it stimulated something in my life to be faithful so I made a choice every day every day we have a choice to remain faithful yet his faithfulness to us is such that when we are not faithful his faithfulness manifests itself in our life you think about the grace of God His mercies are new every morning and you wake up in one morning you don't read the Bible like you should you don't pray like you shouldn't maybe you do that for weeks maybe you do it for months or for years and I'll break this fear tonight it's just a small group so you don't tell nobody okay but preachers do that too they do that too you get in a rut where you just don't do what you should but he's faithful and even during those times when we are not he's faithful and so we keep plowing we keep planting seed like demanded in the Hebrides Highland we keep talking to people we keep inviting them to church we keep sowing the seed and tilling the ground whether it's hard or whether it's easy it doesn't matter he doesn't look at our success he looks at our faithfulness whether the church's fault of the church is empty have we been faithful whether we see a million souls saved or 1 have we been faithful I think of the story of a Scottish minister who preached he had a church and he preached a full year and that year only one soul come to Christ he was a young boy about 12 years old just a boy from the church one boy in the whole year came to Christ and all that year he he told he worked with the people and no one else came and the Deacons and the and the officers of the church come to him at the end of the year and they said this has been a bad year the church hasn't grown and he wept over it he said what am I gonna do and he was about ready to quit but somehow he found the strength to go on the boys name was Robert Moffat who became one of the fathers of African missions who converted thousand of souls in foreign lands to to God why because one little minister was found faithful there's a song that was written not long ago actually that says and I like the song he says I like to meet the preacher who prayed for the preacher who prayed for me I like to talk to the person who witness to the person who witness to me because somebody was faithful somebody was faithful to continue to live the message somebody was faithful so my kids have a chance to live for God because somebody and another generation was faithful this church has a chance or an opportunity rather to do what's right and live for God because somebody somewhere was faithful when it would be easier to just shut the doors and go home but somebody's faithful but that faithfulness that choice of faithfulness is not just something you did last year but it's something you have to do every day just like it's mercies are new every morning your faithfulness your resolve you've got to be resolved every morning you know how you do that you keep your my eyes off everything down here and you look at that white horse you say I'm gonna be one of those I'm gonna be one of those that come riding back with him on white horses I may not understand it or be able to explain it fully but I'm gonna be one of those it was called who was chosen and who chose to be faithful I'm gonna be one who was faithful it may take some Wednesday nights it may take some some Sundays I don't feel like it it may take sometimes when I testify to people and I don't think even should but I have to be faithful in Matthew 25 and 21 speaks of a faithful servant is that his Lord said unto Him well done thou good and faithful servant thou has been faithful over a few things I will make thee ruler over many things enter thou into the joy of thy Lord I've often wondered but the Branham said I like to hear him when he stood and stretched his arms that day and said coming to me oh ye that labor and are heavy-laden he said now that was past well done he said but well done my good and faithful servant is still in the future hey bad and as blessed as it would be to go back with Harvey and be able to hear him say coming to me it'll be so much more of a blessing to get there on that day and hear him to say well done well done if we enter if we go through life and we struggle and I know some of you do and I know sometimes you struggle to make to try to take God's portion even because you barely make a living I know you struggle sometimes even make it to the house of God maybe there's pain in your body and you struggling yet I find the people to go through the most sometimes are the most faithful but will you struggle to do that and I realize that but you're not doing it for me you're not doing it for these four walls in a building called a church but you're doing it because you want to be there on that day you're doing it because there's something inside of you his faithfulness in your life inspires you to faithfulness in yours just like the example that phen AHA said for his generations on down was an example to them to say not to be faithful so the example that Christ said is an example to us to be faithful you hearing me today right I struggle with it sometimes because you'll say why I just don't feel like it today well if you have a gift in your life and you only use it when you feel like it you're never gonna feel like it because the devil is gonna see to that and part of overcoming is overcoming when you don't feel like it well done my good and faithful servant I want to hear it I like it when you tell me well done it's a good sermon I just that's the flash but I like it the flesh likes to hear it brother Branham said he liked to hear it but then he also said is bad for you so now I like to hear it like to get those Pat's on the back I'm human but all how much more I want to hear well done if nobody ever says it again here if this is the last sermon I ever preached I want to hear well done my good and faithful servant he didn't say my good and prosperous servant my good and successful servant but my good and faithful servant he said I'm living to hear that said the musicians would come there was a hymn written back in the 1920s which was actually a poem I'm gonna read it as a poem tonight but it was written off of the text that we read as a man by the name of Thomas Chisolm was born in a log cabin in Franklin Kentucky in 1866 his family was dirt poor he was not able to acquire a very good education he went to a little bit of school but he never got past elementary school he became a preacher but he was too frail to continue in the ministry his body just wouldn't let him do it he made his living selling insurance seemed like a busted life seemed like a gift that just could never go anywhere but later in life he not out of any particular thing sometimes hymn writers and songwriters are inspired by something that happens like the story of it is well with my soul and that a door if ik thing happened to the man and he lost his family but this was not born of any particular thing but he just realized one day that every morning when he woke up God was faithful he said I realized every morning he's still there whether I'm failing in school or whether I'm failing as a preacher whether I'm failing as a hymn writer failing as an insurance salesman it didn't matter every morning he said God is faithful and he wrote these words he said great is thy faithfulness o God my father there is no shadow of turning with thee thou changest not thy Compassion's they fail not as thou hast been thou forever will be the course says great is thy faithfulness great is thy faithfulness morning by morning new mercies I see oh I have needed thy hand hath provided great is thy faithfulness Lord unto me but the harvest sometimes this hymn has gotten me through some really dark times in my life when I feel like everything's everything is going wrong and I get alone to myself and I wake up in the morning and somehow it's running through my head in spite of all the discouragement says morning by morning new mercies I see all I have needed thy hand hath provided great is thy faithfulness Lord unto me the last verse says pardon for sin and a peace that endureth that own dear presence to cheer and to guide strains for today and bright hope for tomorrow blessings all mine with 10,000 beside it's a good song but Thomas Chisolm wrote another song this have always been dear to my heart and I never connected the two until this week he also wrote a song and I'll just read the chorus it goes like this he said ode to be like thee Oh to be like thee blessed Redeemer purest how hard come in thy sweetness coming thy fullness stamp thine own image deep on my heart great is thy faithfulness but I want to be like that Lord your mercies are new every morning but I want to wake up every morning with resolve in my heart I'm gonna be faithful from now on I'm gonna be faithful I'm gonna let the image of Christ be so deeply stamped in my life until faithfulness can spring from it maybe so in our hearts today let's pray Heavenly Father we love you tonight we're so thankful for your mercy and your grace I don't always feel like preaching but Lord somehow you make a way we're so grateful for the times like Sunday when everything's so free and we feel your presence and other times it's hard it's gonna be all of us have been to services that are hard and you have to press through demons to even get a word through but Lord whether it's the good or the bad it doesn't matter you promised that you would be with us every day morning by morning your mercies are new and we're so grateful Lord we're so grateful we want to be like you Lord we don't want to be caught up in a cycle of unfaithfulness Lord we want to be like you we want to stand in this hour and be faithful to the word help us Lord because we know it will only be those who are faithful but you new heart somehow you knew before you call this and before do you chose us because you said not one of them would be lost somehow you knew that we would choose to be faithful we're so grateful Lord in those moments when we're not as faithful as we should be I pray you would help us Lord I pray you to help us to realize that your mercies are still there every morning that we wake up but the men how do you know that there's still mercy someone had asked me that question Lord I could say because every morning when I wake up there's mercy every day when I mess up in some way there's still mercy and if there's mercy for me there's mercy for someone else I may not know exactly how or why but I know somehow there's mercy if I'm able to make it surely God can save if he could save me the chiefest of sinners as Paul said if you saved the chief of sinners how much more just the rank-and-file sinner god I pray that you would just help us to recognize that in our lives recognize your mercy recognize your grace father even the grace to be able to preacher to sing or to talk her to walk the grace to be able to come to the house of God grace to be able to get up in the morning alright even though our bonus my ache and old age may creep on with some but Oh God we know you're faithful faithful to the end because you come back and you are faithful and true we thank you for that lord help us to remain faithful to the message of the hour help us to remain
