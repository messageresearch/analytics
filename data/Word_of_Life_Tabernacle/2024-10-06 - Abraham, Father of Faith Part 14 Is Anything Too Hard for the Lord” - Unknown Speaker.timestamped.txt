[43:35] of the Lord this morning Genesis Chapter
[43:38] 18 we're going to go back to Abraham

[43:43] through
[43:44] 15 there's going to be a uh a coat and
[43:48] blanket drive for uh the victims in
[43:51] North Carolina Tennessee brother Donnie
[43:53] Reagan's church is is doing that and so
[43:56] they're they just let me know about that
[43:58] so we're going to participate in that uh
[44:01] from this area so if you've got
[44:03] something I'm going to put more details
[44:04] on the WhatsApp group so you'll be able
[44:07] to know what what all they can take and
[44:09] what they can't but we will have a a
[44:12] chance to give uh I know you don't
[44:14] always have money but if you have
[44:16] something laid around the house that's
[44:17] nice that you'd want to give to somebody
[44:20] uh because uh Winter's coming on
[44:22] especially they're in the mountains and
[44:23] they're very uh they they need some
[44:25] things like that so well coordinate with
[44:27] them but uh we we'll try to do that by
[44:29] next week next Sunday morning Genesis 18
[44:33] and verse
[44:35] 9 remember communion tonight as
[44:38] well and they said unto him where is
[44:40] Sarah thy wife and he said behold in the
[44:45] tent and he said I will certainly return
[44:48] unto thee according to the time of life
[44:51] and lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son
[44:54] and Sarah heard it in the tent door
[44:57] which was behind him now Abraham and
[45:00] Sarah were old and well stricken in age
[45:03] and it ceased to be with Sarah after the
[45:05] manner of women therefore Sarah laughed
[45:08] within herself saying after I am waxed
[45:11] old shall I have pleasure my Lord being
[45:13] old also and the Lord said unto Abraham
[45:16] wherefore did Sarah laugh saying shall I
[45:19] of assurity bear a child which I'm old
[45:22] and verse 14 I want us to pay attention
[45:24] to today is anything too hard for the
[45:29] Lord at the time appointed I will return
[45:32] unto thee according to the time of life
[45:34] and Sarah shall have a son then Sarah
[45:38] denied saying I laugh not for she was
[45:40] afraid and he said nay but thou did
[45:43] laugh pray the Lord would add his
[45:45] Blessing to the word you may be
[45:49] seated Abraham's faith is
[45:52] legendary he believed when all he had
[45:54] was a voice telling him to leave his
[45:57] Kindred and go into a strange country
[46:01] and the Bible puts us puts it this way
[46:03] in Hebrews 11:8 by faith Abraham when he
[46:06] was called to go out into a place which
[46:08] he should after receive for an
[46:10] inheritance obeyed and he went out not
[46:13] knowing whether he went by faith he
[46:16] sojourned in the land of promise as in a
[46:19] strange country dwelling in Tabernacles
[46:22] with Isaac and Jacob The Heirs with him
[46:24] of the same promise for he looked for a
[46:27] city which hath foundations whose
[46:30] Builder and maker is God and we've
[46:32] discussed that to do that it takes big
[46:35] faith it takes brwy faith it it takes
[46:37] Faith with muscles brother brandom puts
[46:40] it this way he said shame on you
[46:41] Christians that call yourself Christians
[46:44] and go around with a weary well I don't
[46:46] know if I go to church he said oh you're
[46:49] a poor
[46:51] excuse he said let me tell you lift up
[46:54] your heads straighten up your chest he
[46:57] said oh my use Faith he said faith is
[47:01] the boss that's right faith has hairs on
[47:04] its chest brother I mean it's got big
[47:06] muscles when it speaks all the worries
[47:10] drop from one side to the other When
[47:13] Faith speaks the devil says now you just
[47:15] can't make it you can't do this you're
[47:17] ashamed to testify but Faith raises up
[47:20] and says shut up I got the floor amen
[47:23] sure Faith takes the initiative that was
[47:27] Abraham Abraham believed God and he and
[47:30] he and he walked in that direction that
[47:32] God showed him he obeyed God Sarah also
[47:36] had to have faith the Bible says through
[47:38] faith also Sarah herself received
[47:42] strength to conceive seed and was
[47:44] delivered of a child when she was past
[47:47] age because she judged him faithful who
[47:50] had promised have you judged him
[47:52] faithful today have you judged him
[47:54] faithful because she judged him faith
[47:56] faithful she had Faith now though she
[47:59] laughed initially in the end she judged
[48:02] him faithful her body was changed and
[48:05] she had the child now brother bandam
[48:07] taught us and I'm trying to kind of
[48:09] hurry and lay lay a background to get
[48:11] where I want to go this morning but
[48:12] brother bam taught us that the reason
[48:14] Sarah laughed is because she didn't
[48:17] understand that the hungry stranger with
[48:20] dust on his clothes was God in flesh
[48:23] because she did not have that Revelation
[48:26] that Abra abam had of who that was that
[48:28] was speaking to them that's the reason
[48:30] she laughed that's the reason she tried
[48:32] to deny laughing because she didn't
[48:35] understand that that was God in flesh
[48:37] and it's important today we understand
[48:39] what happened in our day because if you
[48:41] don't understand the revealing of the
[48:43] son of man you won't have the faith to
[48:45] believe what that son of man spoke and
[48:48] what he said because it was the
[48:49] revealing of the son of man that opened
[48:51] up the Mysteries opened up the seals to
[48:53] us showed us where we're at in this age
[48:55] and so if you're looking for something
[48:58] else to come or or something else you
[49:00] what is it you you don't really
[49:02] understand who came in our day you don't
[49:04] really understand there was Christ
[49:05] standing there that revealed the Myst
[49:07] wasn't wasn't brother Brandon but it was
[49:09] Christ that did that so was Christ
[49:12] borrowing a body amen just like he wants
[49:15] to borrow your body today he wants to
[49:17] borrow my body he wants us to be his
[49:20] body on the Earth right so brother
[49:22] bandam taught us that she laughed
[49:24] because she didn't understand and when
[49:26] then she laughed she should have died
[49:29] right
[49:32] there oh my she should have been killed
[49:36] right there it should have that was
[49:37] Elohim sitting there right in a body
[49:40] that he just blew into dust and created
[49:42] and he was sitting there and she laughed
[49:44] at him but and she should have died but
[49:47] she didn't die brother Brandon said let
[49:50] me give you a little Grace here Brethren
[49:53] that minute God would have killed Sarah
[49:55] for disbelieving that Angel he didn't
[49:58] right look at that angel went down and
[50:00] told Lot's wife not to look back see
[50:02] what happened to her remember Lot's wife
[50:04] what happened to Lost wife the minute
[50:06] she looked back she was turned into a
[50:08] pillar of salt but there was a measure
[50:10] of Grace for Sarah that wasn't there for
[50:13] Lot's wife because Lot's wife was
[50:15] married to
[50:17] lot right that's why she was called
[50:19] Lot's wife because she was married to
[50:21] lot that's a revelation isn't
[50:23] it some of y'all never realize that
[50:25] she's called Lot's wife we don't know
[50:27] her name she just lost wife she was
[50:28] married to lot but let me tell you this
[50:30] morning I'm not married to lot I'm not
[50:32] married to a denomination I'm not
[50:34] married to the world I'm not my old
[50:36] husband is dead and I'm married to
[50:38] Christ the word we are Mrs Jesus Christ
[50:41] so when we laughed when we disbelieved
[50:43] when we did things we shouldn't come on
[50:45] church you've not been perfect since you
[50:47] got the Holy Ghost you've not been
[50:48] perfect since you come to church you've
[50:50] not been perfect since you heard the
[50:52] message but why were you not done away
[50:54] with why did he have mercy on you
[50:56] because you belong to Abraham you belong
[50:59] to Jesus Christ and that's why he
[51:01] couldn't kill you he couldn't take you
[51:06] out yes sir glory to God we just sto
[51:10] there and preach for a while God could
[51:13] have killed her but he didn't do
[51:15] it Oh my he said he couldn't take Sarah
[51:18] because she was part of Abraham and
[51:20] today the unbelief of the real true
[51:21] church she has unbelief but he can't
[51:24] touch her we're in Jesus
[51:27] he said you can't take the church
[51:28] without hurting Christ he couldn't take
[51:30] Sarah without hurting Abraham so Grace
[51:34] covered him well I'm so glad for his
[51:36] grace
[51:38] today but he did call her out on it amen
[51:42] said why did Sarah
[51:46] laugh why did Sarah
[51:49] laugh now again Sarah laughed because
[51:51] she didn't understand and she didn't
[51:54] understand because Satan had done
[51:56] everything he could to prevent her from
[52:00] receiving that
[52:02] visitation just like he does everything
[52:04] he can to prevent you from receiving a
[52:08] visitation now Satan was trying to block
[52:11] Abraham and Sarah brother Brandon said
[52:13] because he knew that there was an
[52:15] Angelic visitation
[52:18] coming Oh my he said then when
[52:21] everything Rises all out of order and we
[52:23] know something is wrong in other words
[52:25] we know something's up God's doing
[52:26] something or the devil's trying to
[52:28] trying to mess things up and you wonder
[52:30] what's going on look what's look what's
[52:32] happening he said now I believe maybe if
[52:34] we would listen to Satan we might miss
[52:36] seeing it like Sarah did right so when
[52:39] things begin to get stirred up and
[52:41] things begin to get people begin to get
[52:42] fussy and people begin to get uh begin
[52:45] to be at odds with one another we can
[52:47] look at that one or two ways we can say
[52:49] Well it must be that the devil's just
[52:51] had his way and and he's just but why is
[52:53] he so mad why is he so upset well it's
[52:55] because God is about to do something
[52:58] he's about to he's about to visit them
[53:00] oh my he's about to reveal to them the
[53:03] secrets of their hearts now look so
[53:05] Sarah got fussy because Satan was trying
[53:08] to stir her up before the visitation of
[53:11] the Angel that's right so brother
[53:13] brandom said let's think that Sarah
[53:15] being that she done what she did let's
[53:17] think that she was kind of a little
[53:18] fussy that morning that she might have
[53:20] said Abraham you know the supplies are
[53:22] getting low here and the herdsman say
[53:25] the pasture is all dried up in the water
[53:27] holes I think you made the wrong
[53:29] decision when you chose to come up here
[53:32] and let lot and Mrs lot and their family
[53:34] live down there with plenty that's easy
[53:36] to look at lot making the wrong decision
[53:37] in
[53:39] hindsight right but but right then Sarah
[53:42] looked at it it looked like lot's
[53:43] decision was pretty good yeah because
[53:46] Mrs lot got to do pretty much whatever
[53:48] she wanted to
[53:49] do right he said when why the other day
[53:52] sometime ago when I went to the city why
[53:55] Mrs lot had on one of the the prettiest
[53:56] dresses I ever seen it was oh church we
[53:59] get in trouble when we got get to
[54:00] looking around don't
[54:02] we what other people have and we we get
[54:05] to coveting what other people have he
[54:06] said I he said it was styled by the
[54:08] Egyptians why a camel Caravan come
[54:10] through and she got the new Styles
[54:11] there's no such thing as them Caravans
[54:13] and styles coming throughout here oh but
[54:16] brother BR said there was more than a
[54:17] caravan coming it was an Angelic
[54:20] visitation but he said I might have
[54:22] heard her say something like this you
[54:24] ought have seen the new hairdo she had
[54:26] you know a woman 60 years old trying to
[54:28] look 20 well praise the
[54:31] Lord and poor old Abraham I love this
[54:34] you remember Abraham was sitting in the
[54:36] tent door do you ever think about why he
[54:37] was sitting in the tent door he didn't
[54:39] want to be in the
[54:46] house poor old Abraham faithful old
[54:50] brother he said that didn't Shake him
[54:52] one bit he just walks over and gets his
[54:55] chair sits down in the door of the tent
[54:58] oh my when everybody's fussing
[55:00] everything's going on remember it's just
[55:01] the devil trying to get you upset where
[55:03] you can't receive nothing from the
[55:05] service it's just the devil trying to
[55:06] prevent a breakthrough I say it's time
[55:08] we get our chair and sit in the door of
[55:10] the tent and wait for God to do
[55:12] something yes sir
[55:16] hallelujah amen again brother BR said
[55:18] here he is now and Sarah he said let's
[55:20] just break in on her for a minute there
[55:23] she sit back there say I wonder how many
[55:24] Fanatics my husband can entertain
[55:28] a she saw the dust on the
[55:31] clothes she saw the that they were
[55:33] Travelers she said there just another
[55:35] fanatic claiming to have a word from God
[55:38] but this was God himself yes sir oh
[55:41] church he said well I see the Angel
[55:43] takes his chair maybe and leans back his
[55:47] back towards the tent and Sarah
[55:49] listening through the tent you know kind
[55:51] of eavesdropping and she was kind of in
[55:53] an awful mood that morning he said you
[55:56] don't see things when you come to church
[55:59] in that kind of a
[56:01] mood he said you just no need to trying
[56:04] it you might as well stay at home yeah
[56:06] right right just change your attitude
[56:07] you can come to church he said when you
[56:10] come to church come prayed up come in
[56:13] the atmosphere come
[56:15] expecting
[56:17] amen Abraham knew at the time of the
[56:20] promise was coming close it had to be he
[56:21] was hundred years old he was expecting
[56:23] at any time he watched every minute
[56:27] when he run in and told Sarah this I
[56:28] believe is our day of visitation and she
[56:31] kind of looked at him with them big eyes
[56:32] and thought well Abraham You' said that
[56:34] a long time but you know there will come
[56:36] a time when it'll be so if God said so
[56:40] oh she had Faith but it was just her
[56:41] mood that she was in and I think a lot
[56:44] of us have more faith than we know that
[56:45] we have but it's just the mood that
[56:47] we're in
[56:49] sometimes and you got to break out of
[56:51] that mood or you're never going to
[56:52] receive a visitation from the angel you
[56:54] said well I'm just not getting nothing
[56:55] out of church anymore why don't you
[56:57] break out of that mood and let God begin
[56:59] to speak to you again let God begin to
[57:01] wash over you again let the word begin
[57:04] to have an impact in your life
[57:09] again she was kind of in a halfway upset
[57:12] mood he said from her condition that
[57:15] morning she thought in her heart isn't
[57:16] that a silly thing think in our day me
[57:18] an old woman as old as I am here I am 90
[57:20] years old there since my husband Abraham
[57:22] 100 years old not been with me as a
[57:24] woman for 50 years Abraham well we've
[57:26] been married since we were about 177 him
[57:28] about 27 said how could that be how
[57:31] could it be he said see she had herself
[57:33] all out of condition to receive it when
[57:36] God brought him he said oh my don't
[57:38] never get that in your heart be open be
[57:42] open how can you receive from God if
[57:44] you're not open it Lord be ready said
[57:47] she missed it she failed to see it here
[57:50] she was in that shape saying now how
[57:52] could that happen in our modern time how
[57:54] could it happen to me in my condition
[57:57] but it happened just the same Abraham
[58:00] out there waiting with anticipation you
[58:02] see he said it wasn't made known to her
[58:04] it was made known to them that was
[58:06] looking for it yeah so look at the
[58:08] difference here she is in the tent all
[58:10] in a bad mood and she laughed but
[58:12] Abraham was in the door of the tent and
[58:14] he was waiting with expectation for God
[58:16] to do something he said Abraham waiting
[58:19] out there with expectation he said
[58:20] that's the way it comes yet to those who
[58:22] are looking so he was watching Abraham
[58:24] was he said yes my Lord yes that's right
[58:27] the promise was I believed it all along
[58:29] he said now Abraham just about the time
[58:30] of life it'll be each month when I'm
[58:32] going to visit you and you're going to
[58:33] have that baby and Sarah you know to
[58:35] herself went hump laughed kind of to
[58:38] herself he said now watch Abraham gets
[58:39] the sign now Sarah was too
[58:43] flustrated watch Abraham gets
[58:46] it immediately yeah so let me wash your
[58:49] feet Let Me Entertain You and Sarah s
[58:53] back there in the tent said not me
[58:58] come on Church how many times we sit in
[59:00] church like that if we just really
[59:03] honest that's true right we sit back
[59:06] there and and we see somebody just
[59:08] really get blessed the preacher is under
[59:10] the anointing and the people are being
[59:12] blessed and we're sitting there going
[59:14] well you know that's kind of In the
[59:17] Flesh I used to do that too back when I
[59:19] was new you know well maybe you need to
[59:21] bring back the new again
[59:23] come maybe you need to go back and get
[59:25] another dip of the out of the fountain
[59:27] get another drink out of the
[59:28] fountain oh my now watch she sat there
[59:33] criticizing brother BR said sometimes
[59:35] we're too frustrated about the fellow
[59:37] the other fellow that's got the biggest
[59:39] denomination or his congregation dresses
[59:41] better than mine they've got a bigger
[59:43] Church Down on the Corner than we got he
[59:45] said what difference does that make I
[59:48] want God I don't care if I have to
[59:50] worship him on the street corner and
[59:51] come here with me this morning I want
[59:53] God he I I let me have in my heart and
[59:55] condition if I wear overall so I can
[59:57] watch God and see his move and recognize
[1:00:00] him not pass it by he said Abraham where
[1:00:02] is your wife Sarah stranger never seen
[1:00:04] him before where is your wife Sarah how
[1:00:06] did he know that he had a wife how did
[1:00:08] he know her name was Sarah said she's in
[1:00:10] the tent behind you and when Sarah
[1:00:12] laughed he said why did she laugh he
[1:00:13] caught the sign he knew what it was
[1:00:15] Sarah didn't get it she even come forth
[1:00:17] and tried to deny it he said God would
[1:00:19] have destroyed her upon that if she
[1:00:21] hadn't been a part of Abraham a lot of
[1:00:23] times our unbelief would destroy us if
[1:00:25] it wasn't for the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:00:27] God can't destroy us now because the
[1:00:30] blood of Jesus Christ keeps God off of
[1:00:32] us we are a part of Christ just as Sarah
[1:00:34] was part of Abraham for we are the bride
[1:00:36] of Christ amen and we people who's born
[1:00:39] of the spirit of God ought to wake
[1:00:42] up right get out of our
[1:00:46] stews
[1:00:48] church and watch for the supernatural
[1:00:52] sign of the coming of the Lord Jesus his
[1:00:55] signs
[1:00:56] that he promised now now that's the
[1:00:59] background for what we want to say this
[1:01:02] morning yeah now he said to Abraham he
[1:01:06] said is anything too hard for the
[1:01:10] Lord is anything too hard for the Lord
[1:01:13] the word hard actually means wondrous
[1:01:17] wonderful
[1:01:19] Miracle is there anything too
[1:01:22] wonderful for God it's something that is
[1:01:25] inexplicit aable and
[1:01:27] Indescribable according to human
[1:01:30] standards brother Brandon would call it
[1:01:31] a
[1:01:32] paradox something that's true yet you
[1:01:36] you can't even imagine it being true it
[1:01:38] just is yeah right so is anything too
[1:01:43] wonderful for God now if you go into the
[1:01:46] scriptures as I begin to study on this
[1:01:48] word begin to look at what it was and
[1:01:50] what it what it meant it's speaking of
[1:01:53] God being Elohim the Lord LD the Lord
[1:01:56] being Elohim being the creator of the
[1:01:58] universe we'll get more into that in a
[1:02:00] moment and and we've got to trust him
[1:02:03] and Abraham trusted him for who he was
[1:02:06] he trusted him because of who he was and
[1:02:11] so what faith in God is it means that
[1:02:13] when everybody else is selling out if if
[1:02:16] you would say that God was a corporation
[1:02:18] we could put it like that and everybody
[1:02:20] else is selling
[1:02:22] stock in God right Abraham is
[1:02:27] buying Abraham is actually he's actually
[1:02:31] investing in God when everyone else is
[1:02:35] selling everything off in a
[1:02:36] panic are you with me now when Sarah and
[1:02:40] and and everybody else that that hears
[1:02:43] it they're saying oh that can't be true
[1:02:44] there's nothing but but Abraham and
[1:02:46] those who are the Seed of Abraham I
[1:02:48] believe today when things begin to look
[1:02:50] like it can't be possible we reinvest in
[1:02:54] Elohim yes
[1:02:56] right because he's the only one who's
[1:02:58] going to make it through now and and the
[1:03:00] only way that we can make it through now
[1:03:02] now when if you go back to Jeremiah I
[1:03:04] want you to go to Jeremiah chapter
[1:03:07] 32 there was a time when the Babylonians
[1:03:09] were getting ready to carry the people
[1:03:11] of Jerusalem captive and I can imagine
[1:03:14] at that time now I want you to think
[1:03:16] carnally for just a moment because I
[1:03:18] want you to think about the real
[1:03:20] estate and during that time the real
[1:03:22] estate market in Jerusalem would have
[1:03:25] been really bad yeah like worse than
[1:03:26] Cherokee
[1:03:29] Village right we all went through the
[1:03:31] time when everybody's buying Cherokee
[1:03:33] Village and now the real estate signs
[1:03:35] start to you know during covid now all
[1:03:37] the signs come up and and and the
[1:03:39] Market's up and down right so so
[1:03:42] Jerusalem the market was down when I'm
[1:03:45] talking down I mean really down because
[1:03:48] your faith in what you're buying if you
[1:03:51] buy if you buy land say if you buy real
[1:03:54] estate if you buy stock in a company
[1:03:56] you're putting trust in that company or
[1:03:58] that real estate or or or that
[1:04:00] government to be able to back up your
[1:04:02] claims I found out when I went to Africa
[1:04:04] that the people don't really own
[1:04:06] anything because it's kind of first come
[1:04:07] first sered because people just squat on
[1:04:09] the land if you're able to build a house
[1:04:11] on it the government will honor your
[1:04:13] claim because you're able to do what
[1:04:14] most people aren't so if you can get a
[1:04:16] piece of property and build a house on
[1:04:18] it or build walls around it then you own
[1:04:21] it and that's not the way we are here
[1:04:23] why because we trust that the law is
[1:04:25] going to back us up right if we have a
[1:04:28] deed to property so during that time
[1:04:31] when the Babylonians were coming in it
[1:04:33] looked like that Judah was about to be
[1:04:35] destroyed Israel had already been taken
[1:04:37] captive Judah is about to be taken
[1:04:38] captive and it looked like there was no
[1:04:40] hope for the real estate market to ever
[1:04:43] come back and you say brother Ben what
[1:04:45] in the world are you talking about well
[1:04:47] I'm about to read something to you we
[1:04:49] find during that time that God spoke to
[1:04:52] a prophet named Jeremiah and he said I
[1:04:55] want you to buy a piece of land in a
[1:04:58] down
[1:05:00] Market I want I want you to think about
[1:05:02] this now I want you to buy a piece of
[1:05:04] land in an extreme fear
[1:05:08] market and Jeremiah's nephew happened to
[1:05:11] be selling some family property of
[1:05:13] course they had to offer it to someone
[1:05:14] in the family first the Lord told
[1:05:17] Jeremiah he said buy it pay full price
[1:05:20] for it right don't don't pay him a
[1:05:22] reduce pay full price for it and bury
[1:05:26] take take a deed sign the deed and bury
[1:05:28] a sealed copy of the deed on the
[1:05:31] land oh my so Jeremiah 32:14 thus sayith
[1:05:35] the Lord of hosts the god of Israel take
[1:05:37] these evidences that would be a deed the
[1:05:38] evidence of the purchase which is sealed
[1:05:41] and this evidence which is open so they
[1:05:43] would seal one and another one that
[1:05:44] everyone could read put them in an earth
[1:05:46] and vessel that they may continue many
[1:05:48] days for thus sayith the Lord of hosts
[1:05:50] the god of Israel houses and Fields and
[1:05:53] Vineyards shall be possessed again in
[1:05:58] this land now watch what kind of Faith
[1:06:01] you would have to have what kind of
[1:06:02] obedience you'd have to have because
[1:06:04] money was scarce right it's hard to come
[1:06:07] by who buys when a foreign army is at
[1:06:09] the gates and people are starving in the
[1:06:13] city right and the government's about to
[1:06:15] be
[1:06:16] overthrown and from that time they never
[1:06:18] had another stable Jewish government
[1:06:21] until
[1:06:23] 1948 so for literally thousands of years
[1:06:27] there was not a stable Jewish government
[1:06:30] in that land after the Babylonians came
[1:06:33] right they were always a vassel state or
[1:06:35] or under the Persians under the Romans
[1:06:37] under somebody else but there was no no
[1:06:40] guarantee that that deed would ever be
[1:06:42] honored but God told Abraham or God told
[1:06:45] Jeremiah rather he said go and buy land
[1:06:49] and Jeremiah's like today
[1:06:54] Lord people are going to think I'm weird
[1:06:57] people going to think it's
[1:06:58] strange why are you buying land when
[1:07:01] everybody else is
[1:07:03] selling oh my because when everybody
[1:07:06] else gave up on the land God never
[1:07:10] did listen to me church and I just think
[1:07:12] spiritually when everybody else gave up
[1:07:15] on
[1:07:16] you God never
[1:07:19] did so when you were in your lowest
[1:07:22] condition when you were in your worst
[1:07:23] spot of life when you were going through
[1:07:25] the darkest moment of your life you were
[1:07:28] really going through it that's when God
[1:07:29] said I want to invest in them I going to
[1:07:32] build on them I want to preach the word
[1:07:34] to them I want to I want to help them I
[1:07:36] want to heal
[1:07:37] them thank you Lord he didn't cast you
[1:07:40] away when you were in your darkest
[1:07:42] moments you remember before you got
[1:07:44] saved you remember what some of the
[1:07:45] things you did you don't even want to
[1:07:46] think about them now but in your darkest
[1:07:48] moment he already knew you you were
[1:07:50] already his child he was already
[1:07:52] thinking about you he was already
[1:07:54] reaching out for you and in your darkest
[1:07:56] moment God didn't give
[1:08:03] up when everything was contrary now go
[1:08:06] back to Abraham what did Abraham do
[1:08:08] Abraham made an investment in the
[1:08:10] promises an investment in the promises
[1:08:13] when everybody else gives up I'm going
[1:08:15] to say yes Lord I believe when it's
[1:08:18] impossible I'm going to say Lord I
[1:08:20] believe that
[1:08:22] you now listen there were hundred
[1:08:25] hundreds of tribes there have been many
[1:08:28] kingdoms much much greater than than
[1:08:32] Israel in the world Israel is a very
[1:08:35] small nation a really a relatively small
[1:08:37] group of people compared to the ones in
[1:08:41] China or in India or even the
[1:08:43] civilizations here in the US there were
[1:08:45] much greater tribes here in the US if
[1:08:48] you go over to uh to Illinois or over by
[1:08:51] St Louis you can find where the mound
[1:08:53] builders were there and had huge cities
[1:08:56] uh maybe a thousand years ago or
[1:08:57] something like that and so the the uh uh
[1:09:02] the people there there have been many
[1:09:03] groups of people who' just passed off
[1:09:05] the face of the Earth right just left
[1:09:08] the history books go try to find an
[1:09:12] amalaki right or a
[1:09:15] Philistine right or or any of them guys
[1:09:18] right any of the people that were in the
[1:09:19] land before Israel was that were that
[1:09:22] were greater excuse me that were greater
[1:09:24] than Israel was that had more money than
[1:09:26] Israel did that had more land than
[1:09:28] Israel did that had better land than
[1:09:31] Israel did who still exists
[1:09:34] today think about it very few if any
[1:09:38] have continued till today and yet the
[1:09:41] Jews have been persecuted like no other
[1:09:43] people they were driven from their land
[1:09:45] they were they were slaughtered listen
[1:09:47] the Hool caust wasn't the first time it
[1:09:49] happened it happened in under the Romans
[1:09:51] it happened it happened all down through
[1:09:53] history it happened under the Spanish it
[1:09:54] happened it happened under different
[1:09:56] empires in different places at different
[1:09:58] times they were run from one country to
[1:10:00] another under the Russians they were
[1:10:01] they were driven from place to place to
[1:10:03] place to place and it seemed like they
[1:10:05] would never be able to be a people again
[1:10:07] but God has told Jeremiah buy land buy
[1:10:11] some property in the land because one
[1:10:13] day it's going to be a land again it's
[1:10:15] going to be a place again where there's
[1:10:17] laws it's going to be a place again
[1:10:18] where there's people
[1:10:22] sir I hope you hear me this morning
[1:10:27] houses this is the word of the Lord
[1:10:29] houses and Fields and Vineyards shall be
[1:10:32] possessed again they won't be owned by a
[1:10:35] foreign
[1:10:36] Nation they'll be owned by Israelites
[1:10:39] yes Jewish
[1:10:41] people are you with me now and Satan's
[1:10:44] still trying to knock them off that
[1:10:48] land but in 1947 or 8 whenever they
[1:10:51] become a nation the Star of David was
[1:10:53] raised it took thousands of
[1:10:55] years but God kept his
[1:10:58] word right Hallelujah now listen what
[1:11:02] Jeremiah says when he buys this land he
[1:11:05] said now when I had delivered the
[1:11:07] evidence of the purchase unto baric the
[1:11:09] son of Niah I prayed unto the Lord
[1:11:11] saying oh Lord God behold thou has made
[1:11:15] the Heaven and the earth now watch what
[1:11:17] he's doing he's properly orienting
[1:11:20] himself toward God this is important
[1:11:22] church I don't want to take too long but
[1:11:24] it's important
[1:11:25] yeah you don't want to get to where you
[1:11:28] look at God like a man all right or you
[1:11:31] look at God like even a preacher yeah or
[1:11:34] even a prophet yeah that's not who God
[1:11:37] is right God is the god of the prophets
[1:11:40] right Elohim created the dust on the
[1:11:43] prophet's clothes right Elohim created
[1:11:47] all the things that that exist today he
[1:11:49] was before there was anything he was the
[1:11:52] self-existing
[1:11:53] one and so and so here Jeremiah calls
[1:11:57] out during this time of extreme fear
[1:11:59] during this time he said I'm going to
[1:12:01] obey your word because of who you are
[1:12:04] because I believe I wonder if there's
[1:12:06] anybody like that this morning no matter
[1:12:08] what's going on in your life it still
[1:12:10] don't keep you from Amen in the word it
[1:12:12] don't keep you from praising God it
[1:12:14] don't keep you from worshiping in the
[1:12:15] house of the Lord why because you know
[1:12:17] within yourself I I am I I realize who
[1:12:20] God
[1:12:22] is and he's not going to be thrown off
[1:12:24] by some bad decision somebody makes he's
[1:12:26] not going to be thrown off because my
[1:12:28] pastor's not perfect he's not going to
[1:12:30] be thrown off because the deacons aren't
[1:12:31] perfect he's not going to be thrown off
[1:12:33] because somebody else not perfect God is
[1:12:36] God he created all the he existed before
[1:12:39] this church he'll exist after this
[1:12:41] church are you with me now this building
[1:12:44] will pass away one day even this these
[1:12:46] words on the page of this printed book
[1:12:48] will pass away one of these days but he
[1:12:50] said my word will never pass away why
[1:12:52] it's an attribute of who he is
[1:12:56] all
[1:12:57] right TR so when you go through things
[1:13:00] you need to properly Orient yourself
[1:13:02] towards
[1:13:03] God right and it gives you a
[1:13:06] confidence right and you don't have to
[1:13:08] give
[1:13:08] up so you don't give yourself exits
[1:13:12] right you say I'm GNA make it yes it's
[1:13:15] not I'm gonna make it if the church does
[1:13:17] okay or I'm gonna make it if the if the
[1:13:20] pastor does this or I'm going to make it
[1:13:21] if things are going good in the message
[1:13:23] that's not what we go by right but we
[1:13:25] say oh Lord God
[1:13:28] yes behold thou has made the Heaven and
[1:13:31] the Earth by thy great power and stretch
[1:13:33] out arm and there is
[1:13:35] nothing too wonderful all right sir are
[1:13:40] you with me that's the same Hebrew word
[1:13:41] nothing too wonderful so he asked the
[1:13:44] question the angel asked the question
[1:13:46] all the way back to Abraham he said is
[1:13:48] there anything too hard for God and
[1:13:50] Jeremiah answers during a time of
[1:13:52] extreme difficulty when it seemed like
[1:13:54] there was no right answered to give and
[1:13:56] he said there is nothing too hard for
[1:13:59] thee do you realize what time that that
[1:14:02] Jeremiah Was do I don't want to get too
[1:14:04] deep into this today but the time he was
[1:14:05] doing that in was the time oh my when
[1:14:08] the seals were open amen when the land
[1:14:10] was claimed amen that's the time we're
[1:14:12] living in today he said there's going to
[1:14:14] be a time of claiming there's going to
[1:14:16] be a time of possessing that's the hour
[1:14:18] we live in
[1:14:20] today that's good Hallelujah there's
[1:14:24] nothing too hard for
[1:14:27] thee can we believe that
[1:14:30] today he said thou show us loving
[1:14:32] kindness under thousands recompenses the
[1:14:35] iniquity of the fathers into the bosom
[1:14:37] of their children after them the great
[1:14:38] the Mighty God the Lord of hosts is his
[1:14:41] name yeah great in counsel Mighty in
[1:14:44] work for Thine Eyes Are Open upon all
[1:14:48] the ways of the sons of men listen we
[1:14:52] didn't sing Open Your Eyes Lord we we
[1:14:55] said open our eyes
[1:14:58] Lord his eyes are
[1:15:00] open he sees he said which has set signs
[1:15:04] and wonders in the land of Egypt even
[1:15:06] unto this day and in Israel and among
[1:15:08] other men and has made thee a name as at
[1:15:10] this day and has brought forth thy
[1:15:12] People Israel out of the land of Egypt
[1:15:14] with son what's he doing he's
[1:15:15] encouraging himself in the Lord he's
[1:15:17] crying out to God and saying God I know
[1:15:19] you're God it may look dark around me I
[1:15:21] may be dodging Babylonian arrows I might
[1:15:24] they might be taking over over but I
[1:15:25] know God and who you are and so I'm
[1:15:27] investing right now I'm investing in the
[1:15:30] house of God this is the time I'm going
[1:15:31] to go to church I'm not going to quit
[1:15:33] church because things are tough I'm
[1:15:34] going to go to the house of God I'm
[1:15:36] going to believe
[1:15:43] godall thank you Lord Lord thank you
[1:15:49] Lord oh my you love him this morning
[1:15:52] amen he said you brought forth your
[1:15:54] people
[1:15:55] with a strong hand with a stretched out
[1:15:57] arm has given them this land look it's
[1:16:01] given them this land oh my which thou
[1:16:03] did swear to their fathers to give him
[1:16:06] oh my a land flowing with milk and honey
[1:16:09] and they came in and possessed it but
[1:16:12] they obeyed not thy voice neither walked
[1:16:14] in thy law they've done nothing of all
[1:16:15] that thou commandest them to do I love
[1:16:17] this Jeremiah is honest about it they
[1:16:20] were in the situation they were in for a
[1:16:22] reason he said they messed up therefore
[1:16:25] thou has caused all this evil to come
[1:16:27] upon them behold the mounts there coming
[1:16:28] the city to take it and the city's given
[1:16:30] the hand of the calans that fight
[1:16:31] against it so he sitting there watching
[1:16:33] he's looking at the the mounts that
[1:16:35] would be the instruments of warfare the
[1:16:37] great machines that they moved up to the
[1:16:39] edge of the city to walk to to go over
[1:16:42] the wall of the city the ladders that
[1:16:44] they pulled up and the things that they
[1:16:45] built this Machines of Siege Warfare
[1:16:48] that they had built to bring close to
[1:16:50] the wall so they could shoot down into
[1:16:51] the city he said behold the mounts and
[1:16:54] and behold the the calans that fight
[1:16:56] against it because the Sword and the
[1:16:57] Famine of the pestilence and what thou
[1:16:59] has spoken has come to pass and behold
[1:17:01] thou seest it and thou has said unto me
[1:17:05] oh Lord God buy Thee the field for money
[1:17:08] yeah you probably could have got it for
[1:17:10] free yeah he said buy it for money and
[1:17:12] take Witnesses for the city is given
[1:17:15] into the hand of the calans then came
[1:17:17] the word of the Lord unto Jeremiah said
[1:17:19] behold oh listen to what he answers back
[1:17:21] behold I am the Lord the God of All
[1:17:24] Flesh is there
[1:17:25] anything too
[1:17:27] hard for
[1:17:31] me what do you do in your darkest
[1:17:34] moments just want to talk to you for a
[1:17:36] minute because we all go through
[1:17:38] it you can give up if you give up you
[1:17:42] fulfill the devil's
[1:17:46] prophecy or do you
[1:17:49] invest right
[1:17:52] invest amen do you invest or distance
[1:17:56] yourself do you buy or do you
[1:17:59] sell I I read a profile one time with
[1:18:02] Warren Buffett and listened to him speak
[1:18:04] and he was the man who they called The
[1:18:07] Oracle of Omaha he's famous just for
[1:18:08] making money nothing else but he just
[1:18:11] made a lot of money at one time he was
[1:18:12] the richest man in the
[1:18:13] world and the reason that he did he this
[1:18:16] it was very simple he would not he
[1:18:19] refused to judge a company by the
[1:18:20] current climate but he judged it by its
[1:18:23] fundamentals
[1:18:25] and he asked himself if the stock market
[1:18:26] doesn't exist for the next 10 years
[1:18:29] would this company still be worth buying
[1:18:32] would it still exist would it still
[1:18:34] Thrive is the product good right so I
[1:18:37] want to ask you this morning is the
[1:18:39] product
[1:18:41] good oh Church well the are God's
[1:18:44] blessings real as as he really healed
[1:18:47] you as he really saved you it's a
[1:18:48] product that tells you that the that the
[1:18:51] company is good it tells you that that
[1:18:53] that God is good that him is
[1:18:55] good right so he he famously invested
[1:18:59] billions in
[1:19:00] cocacola he said oh you can't make any
[1:19:02] money in Coca-Cola because it looked
[1:19:04] like during there was a time there you
[1:19:05] remember New
[1:19:07] Coke man I'm I'm old aren't
[1:19:09] I they put out a different flavor of
[1:19:11] coke and nobody liked it and and they
[1:19:13] they did a bunch of other stupid stuff
[1:19:16] but Warren Buffett looked at that and he
[1:19:17] said when everybody else is selling I'm
[1:19:20] going to buy more and he made billions
[1:19:23] of dollars off of for
[1:19:25] Coca-Cola why he has faith in the
[1:19:27] company now Coca-Cola could go broke
[1:19:29] tomorrow won't be my
[1:19:34] fault I do my part but they could go
[1:19:39] broke tomorrow but God will always keep
[1:19:42] his
[1:19:44] word we serve a God that's bigger than
[1:19:46] coca colola he's bigger than these big
[1:19:49] Corporation he's bigger than the
[1:19:50] Babylonians he's bigger than the
[1:19:51] Russians he's bigger than the Iranians
[1:19:53] he's bigger come on don't lose your
[1:19:55] faith now don't lose your hope now now's

[1:20:36] right marriage on the Rocks I'm just
[1:20:40] preaching this morning you forgive me
[1:20:41] but something going on in your marriage
[1:20:43] and you can't seem like things are tough
[1:20:45] it's not the time to start looking
[1:20:46] around looking for somebody else come on
[1:20:50] church God gave you your wife God gave
[1:20:54] you your husband Now's the Time to
[1:20:56] invest in your marriage that's right
[1:20:58] now's the time to take her out to dinner
[1:21:00] that's right I'm going to get myself in
[1:21:02] trouble
[1:21:04] here Now's the Time to invest you said
[1:21:07] well brother Ben that's because you've
[1:21:08] always had a perfect marriage
[1:21:12] nonsense if just my wife had been
[1:21:14] married it would have been fine but I
[1:21:15] was married too you
[1:21:18] know right all right I had all my
[1:21:22] complexes and all my troubles and all my
[1:21:26] struggles are with but somebody wrote me
[1:21:29] something that that really struck me
[1:21:30] because they said brother Ben I want to
[1:21:31] hear your testimony I thought well maybe
[1:21:34] some of
[1:21:37] it but no I thought about that and I
[1:21:39] thought you know I don't like talking
[1:21:41] about myself but but we you know we've
[1:21:42] had our share of problems just like
[1:21:45] everybody else and and you're going to
[1:21:47] wake up mad sometimes and preachers do
[1:21:51] that more often than most people I think
[1:21:53] because just because of the nature of
[1:21:55] you just spend yourself you ever get a
[1:21:57] really hard day of work and then you get
[1:21:58] you get hit with problems when you get
[1:22:00] home some of you men know what I'm
[1:22:01] talking about some of you ladies know
[1:22:02] what I'm talking about you had a really
[1:22:04] bad day and you just get hit with
[1:22:05] everything when you get home and that's
[1:22:07] a bad time amen right and that's
[1:22:11] Mondays right for preachers you just get
[1:22:14] hit with that you think you're not going
[1:22:15] to snap at your wife or there's gonna be
[1:22:18] right come on commitment isn't
[1:22:22] perfection it's not agreeing on
[1:22:25] everything we still can't agree on when
[1:22:27] to
[1:22:31] leave been married almost 20 years and I
[1:22:34] still can't we still can't get together
[1:22:35] on when to leave the house but God gave
[1:22:38] me my
[1:22:39] wife are you with me church and I
[1:22:42] believe God gave her her husband and so
[1:22:44] we believe in God we trust God it's not
[1:22:47] that we trust that person that we do but
[1:22:49] we trust God more than we do a person
[1:22:51] more than we do a church more than we do
[1:22:53] anything else
[1:22:58] I know it would be hard bringing my
[1:22:59] children here and at the time there's
[1:23:00] only young people at their age in the
[1:23:02] church and it was difficult but we trust
[1:23:05] God right and God built and caused that
[1:23:08] situation to change I thank God for that
[1:23:11] but we trust God and I trust God for
[1:23:13] them today as they start driving and a
[1:23:15] little older I have to trust God we
[1:23:17] believe in God around here we say oh
[1:23:20] Lord God thou who's made the heavens and
[1:23:22] the Earth you're able to keep my kids
[1:23:25] safe you're able you're able to to take
[1:23:27] care of them it's hard when they start
[1:23:29] to leave the house they get a little bit
[1:23:30] older and and they and they begin to
[1:23:33] question everything you do that becomes
[1:23:34] a difficult time of life but God gave me
[1:23:37] those
[1:23:38] children are you with me
[1:23:41] now Abraham trusted God because of that
[1:23:44] he submitted himself to the promise
[1:23:47] listen Church you might be in an
[1:23:48] impossible situation right now but God
[1:23:50] Specializes in those you say how do you
[1:23:53] know he specialized well it's in his
[1:23:55] title it's part of his name did you know
[1:23:58] that unto us a child is born unto us a
[1:24:01] son is given and the government should
[1:24:02] be upon his shoulder and his name Shall
[1:24:04] be Called
[1:24:08] wonderful I can do hard things that's
[1:24:11] literally his name wonderful I do things
[1:24:14] beyond your comprehension wonderful I do
[1:24:17] things you couldn't dream of doing it
[1:24:18] wonderful I bring things to pass that
[1:24:20] you couldn't even bring to pass yourself
[1:24:22] you couldn't even have a part in it but
[1:24:24] I do it anyway he said I'm
[1:24:27] wonderful oh
[1:24:29] hallelujah hallelujah his name is
[1:24:32] wonderful how could anything be too
[1:24:34] wonderful for him he is wonderful Jesus
[1:24:37] is called wonderful because his very
[1:24:38] existence is beyond our capability of
[1:24:40] knowing Isaiah 7:14 therefore the Lord
[1:24:42] himself shall give you a sign Behold a
[1:24:44] virgin shall conceive and bear a son and
[1:24:46] shall call his name Emmanuel that's God
[1:24:48] With Us what was that wonderful we could
[1:24:51] there's no way that his a very birth we
[1:24:53] couldn't even describe how it takes
[1:24:55] place and we need to remember who he is
[1:24:59] and and I've talked about job as we've
[1:25:00] talked about Abraham but job had great
[1:25:02] faith and great patience when when all
[1:25:05] job could see was problems God didn't
[1:25:07] show him a way out he just showed him
[1:25:09] who he
[1:25:10] was go back to job you need to read the
[1:25:13] book of job again Job chapter 38 and
[1:25:15] verse one the Lord answered job out of
[1:25:17] the Whirlwind and said who is this that
[1:25:20] darkeneth counsel by words without
[1:25:22] knowledge GT up now thy loins like a man
[1:25:25] for I will demand of thee and answer
[1:25:27] thou me he said no I'm going to job
[1:25:29] you've talked long enough that's right
[1:25:32] let me talk for a minute that's right oh
[1:25:34] maybe we need to let the Lord speak for
[1:25:36] a minute into our
[1:25:37] situation he said g up now th Lo's like
[1:25:40] a man he said where were you when I laid
[1:25:41] the foundations of the earth declare if
[1:25:44] thou Hast
[1:25:46] understanding who has laid the measures
[1:25:48] thereof if thou knowest in other words
[1:25:50] wh which Carpenter was it that that
[1:25:52] measured it because even really good
[1:25:55] Builders and Carpenters get uh the wrong
[1:25:58] distance on the tape measure sometime
[1:25:59] call out the number
[1:26:02] wrong but the heavens and the Earth were
[1:26:06] framed by the word of God and there's
[1:26:08] not one
[1:26:13] mistake if we were just just a little
[1:26:16] closer to the Sun we'd all burn up if we
[1:26:18] were just a little bit further from the
[1:26:20] Sun we'd all freeze to death but we're
[1:26:23] right in habitable zone and it's the
[1:26:26] only planet they found that can sustain
[1:26:28] life why because God made the heavens
[1:26:31] and the
[1:26:33] Earth God made the Earth God laid the
[1:26:36] foundations he said who has stretched
[1:26:37] the line upon it whereupon are the
[1:26:39] foundations thereof fasting who laid the
[1:26:42] Cornerstone
[1:26:43] thereof amen when the morning Stars sang
[1:26:47] together and all the sons of God shouted
[1:26:49] for Joy oh it's a great it's a great
[1:26:52] Revelation there where were you job you
[1:26:53] were there there but you don't remember
[1:26:55] you were there but you can't you can't
[1:26:57] remember it but I'll tell you this job
[1:26:58] if you were there you're going to be
[1:26:59] there again if you were in my mind
[1:27:02] you're going to be in my
[1:27:07] city notice the question is
[1:27:10] anything too
[1:27:12] hard for the
[1:27:15] Lord for
[1:27:17] Elohim do you remember who I am
[1:27:21] Abraham Abraham let me remind you
[1:27:25] so all I want to do this morning just
[1:27:26] remind you brother brand called him elw
[1:27:30] Elohim we could go read many things
[1:27:32] brother BR said about him he talked
[1:27:33] about him how that he how that he caused
[1:27:36] the Stars to go into space and he and he
[1:27:39] held the earth and its ball of ice in
[1:27:41] his hand and and let it go and and how
[1:27:44] the the spirit the Holy Spirit brooded
[1:27:46] over the face of the deep all those
[1:27:48] things that he told us and what was it
[1:27:51] it was Elohim he was teaching us what is
[1:27:53] the message tell us the message tells us
[1:27:56] that God was not only a great God but he
[1:27:59] was still God that's the revealing of
[1:28:02] the son of man in simple layman's term
[1:28:05] God is a great God and he's a good God
[1:28:08] but he's also a god of today he's the
[1:28:11] same yesterday today and forever he's a
[1:28:13] god of your situation not just of of
[1:28:16] Abraham's situation or Isaac's situation
[1:28:18] not just of the situations of the Bible
[1:28:20] he's a god of your situation this
[1:28:22] morning
[1:28:24] and you say brother Ben well why don't
[1:28:25] you preach on this side or the other but
[1:28:27] I I found if I can get you to believe in
[1:28:30] who God is if we can get you to have
[1:28:32] faith and believe nothing is impossible
[1:28:34] for God and what happens things begin to
[1:28:36] clear up in your life you begin to
[1:28:38] follow the word you begin to obey the
[1:28:39] word why because you believe God is able
[1:28:42] to keep it God is able Paul said I'm I'm

[1:28:47] keep me I know that he's able I'm

[1:28:57] able to help
[1:28:58] me amen look what he says in Psalms 981
[1:29:03] is very similar to
[1:29:05] Jeremiah he said oh sing unto the Lord a
[1:29:07] new

[1:33:57] that city they're going to be right
[1:33:59] there with us they're going to be right
[1:34:01] around the city well I like to think
[1:34:02] that Jeremiah is going to dig up that
[1:34:04] deed and say here it is here here's the
[1:34:06] land that God promised if that's
[1:34:08] possible you understand here's what God
[1:34:10] promised us this is it this is it he
[1:34:12] keeps his word he keeps his word after
[1:34:15] thousands of years and Government after
[1:34:18] Government after government and war
[1:34:19] after war after war and extermination oh
[1:34:22] Church no matter what trial you've been
[1:34:23] through what battle you've been through
[1:34:25] remember he still keeps his word if you
[1:34:28] if you shouted in the mind of God before
[1:34:30] the foundation of the earth you are
[1:34:32] still God's child
[1:34:35] today if he could form himself as a germ
[1:34:39] in the womb of Mary if he could lay the
[1:34:42] foundations of the earth musicians go
[1:34:44] ahead and come he can do
[1:34:46] all
[1:34:48] things why don't we just bow our heads
[1:34:51] together
[1:34:58] you can take away that
[1:35:00] condemnation he can take away what's
[1:35:03] causing that
[1:35:08] condemnation he can destroy that sin in
[1:35:11] your
[1:35:12] life say how do you say that brother Ben
[1:35:14] because he's
[1:35:17] God he created the
[1:35:20] heavens and the Earth
[1:35:26] see well it's an impossible situation I
[1:35:28] don't see it as that not because I'm
[1:35:31] arrogant but because I
[1:35:33] [Music]
[1:35:36] see I see God had his hand on my
[1:35:40] life and I was an impossible
[1:35:45] situation I shouldn't have come out of
[1:35:47] what I come out
[1:35:48] [Music]
[1:35:50] of but God rich and
[1:35:54] Mercy with that great love that he loved
[1:35:57] me
[1:35:58] with pull me
[1:36:03] out is anything too
[1:36:05] hard for the Lord we have to ask
[1:36:08] ourselves that
[1:36:09] question as a
[1:36:13] church what do you believe in about the
[1:36:15] church are you based it on
[1:36:17] people God put you
[1:36:21] here God put the pastor here God put the
[1:36:24] the people
[1:36:26] here I don't believe that's necessarily
[1:36:29] a life sentence if God moves you
[1:36:31] somewhere God bless you I won't fight
[1:36:33] you but while you're here invest I don't
[1:36:36] mean
[1:36:37] financially I mean in in in what God has
[1:36:40] has done here at the
[1:36:42] church he's done great
[1:36:45] things because he's
[1:36:47] God invest in
[1:36:50] that your children invest in your
[1:36:52] children now it's not the time to say
[1:36:54] well you know it's a hard age we'll
[1:36:56] probably lose them nonsense we have a
[1:37:01] word that can keep our children invest
[1:37:04] in your children Now's the Time to buy
