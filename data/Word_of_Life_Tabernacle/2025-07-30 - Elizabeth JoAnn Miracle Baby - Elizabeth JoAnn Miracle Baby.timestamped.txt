[0:02] So, as I was writing this out to try and
[0:05] condense it all, it really just impacted
[0:08] me of how many things went into this
[0:12] testimony. Little things that if we told
[0:16] it all, it would take all day, but I
[0:18] tried to condense it as best I could.
[0:21] Um, our testimony really begins um when
[0:25] we got married in uh 2022. I had
[0:29] rheumatoid arthritis. Um, and due to the
[0:32] medications I was on, we couldn't have a
[0:34] baby because of the side effects, what
[0:36] would happen to the baby. Um, and that
[0:39] really that really grieved us and there
[0:41] was no way for me to get off the
[0:43] medication because of how severe the RA
[0:45] was. Well, Gabe started really praying
[0:48] and claiming that at the July meetings,
[0:51] I would be healed of RA. And we went
[0:54] through the prayer line and God
[0:55] miraculously healed me. I never had to
[0:58] take another medication, no pain after
[1:01] that.
[1:07] Then in 2023, we were told that we would
[1:10] not be able to have a baby and if we
[1:12] wanted to try, it would take extensive
[1:15] um intervention from the medical field.
[1:18] That really broke our hearts. Well,
[1:21] again, it was in the spring when that we
[1:24] were told that. So that summer, we went
[1:26] through the prayer line again. We
[1:28] claimed our healing. We claimed our
[1:30] promised baby. We picked out a name and
[1:33] we held on to faith that we would hold
[1:35] our child
[1:37] during the journey and the wait for that
[1:39] cuz it is a journey. We lost two. But we
[1:43] rejoiced that they even existed because
[1:45] their lives were a testimony.
[1:47] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:48] &gt;&gt; Because we did get pregnant. We did have
[1:50] babies.
[1:53] During the journey of that time, there
[1:55] was so many things that God sent us. So
[1:58] many just pastors or preachers doing
[2:01] sermons or encouragement to help us
[2:03] through that time of struggle.
[2:07] We finally were pregnant with our Lizzy.
[2:10] During the pregnancy, we had a really
[2:12] hard time, both her and I. Satan really
[2:15] fought us, but God was faithful.
[2:18] Then she was born, and we rejoiced
[2:21] thinking that it was over. She we had
[2:23] her in our arms. She was safe. But three
[2:25] days later, we were in the NICU.
[2:30] This was the hardest three days of the
[2:32] whole journey.
[2:34] There was a point where we were in the
[2:36] Ronald McDonald home and Lizzie was down
[2:39] in her room and we were just praying and
[2:41] crying out to God
[2:43] just pleading and kind of upset
[2:48] after everything. Here we were
[2:52] and the song came back to me and the
[2:55] story of Isaac and Abraham
[2:58] and Isaac had to lay his child on the
[3:01] altar to give it back to the Lord
[3:03] knowing that he could lose that child.
[3:06] He had to get to that point to where he
[3:09] was okay in a sense of I know you'll get
[3:12] me through somehow.
[3:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah. So Gabe and I prayed and
[3:17] we just told the Lord, you know, you
[3:18] gave her to us and we rejoiced that we
[3:20] held our promised baby and if you take
[3:23] her, we don't know how, but we know
[3:25] it'll be okay.
[3:28] Little did we know in the room Lizzie
[3:31] was having one of the hardest episodes
[3:33] she had had and there was just this
[3:36] pressure to go down to her and we rushed
[3:40] into her room and right behind us a
[3:42] nurse and a doctor had come in but as
[3:44] soon as we stepped in the room she
[3:46] stabilized and it was over. she didn't
[3:48] have another issue
[3:50] that we went to the ENT and he was like
[3:54] she might have it, she might not, but
[3:58] we just praise the Lord know that she
[4:00] was healed that night.
[4:10] &gt;&gt; Again, there was just so many little
[4:11] things that happened and if I went into
[4:13] it all, it would take all day. But we
[4:16] just want to thank the Lord for
[4:18] Elizabeth Joanne and her name means
[4:21] God's promise or his oath and God's
[4:23] grace and she is a true representation
[4:26] of that.
[4:28] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[4:28] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[4:32] &gt;&gt; His word cannot fail.
[4:36] because that you have said this, because
[4:38] that you have witnessed that you believe
[4:40] it, I'm going to believe this with all
[4:43] my heart and say, "God almighty makes
[4:46] you well."
[4:48] &gt;&gt; Cuz I know it's a scripture. It's the
[4:50] truth. I believe that every person comes
[4:53] through the line will be made totally
[4:55] well.
[4:57] &gt;&gt; Now, what do you do with it? You don't
[4:59] doubt it. You hold it right before you.
[5:01] Your token, what is your token? the Holy
[5:04] Spirit in your heart. You pass through
[5:06] that line. It has to happen. There's no
[5:09] wait for it. No matter how many you've
[5:12] been through before, this is it. This is
[5:14] the hour. This is the time. It's over.
[5:17] It's settled. Just forget you ever was
[5:19] sick or ever had it, ever afflicted or
[5:22] anything. God will take care of it for
[5:24] you. You believe it?
[5:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe it with all my
