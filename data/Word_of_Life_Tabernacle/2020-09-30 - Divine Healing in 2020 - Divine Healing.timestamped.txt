[24:53] god bless you turn with me to psalms
[24:54] chapter 103 verse 1.
[24:56] we're going to take a break from our
[24:58] corinthians series
[25:00] tonight and and this has been on my
[25:02] heart not only because
[25:04] so many have been sick but because the
[25:06] lord is
[25:07] dealing with me in this area
[25:10] you know i want to i want to title this
[25:13] divine healing in 2020
[25:17] and you know we say god is a healer
[25:21] and we believe that but we need our
[25:24] faith to be inspired to that and
[25:28] you know that's what god does for us so
[25:30] many times and i
[25:31] the word that's the job of the word is
[25:33] to inspire our faith to that and so i
[25:35] want to just give you the
[25:36] the word tonight and there's some things
[25:38] here that
[25:39] just been on my heart and i pray that we
[25:41] would understand it and and be able not
[25:43] only to understand it with our minds but
[25:45] again to be inspired by it
[25:47] psalms chapter 103 and verse one of
[25:49] bless the lord o my soul
[25:51] and all that is within me bless his holy
[25:54] name
[25:55] bless the lord o my soul forget not all
[25:58] his benefits
[25:59] who forgiveth all thine iniquities
[26:02] who healeth all thy diseases
[26:06] who redeemeth thy life from destruction
[26:08] who crowneth thee with lovingkindness
[26:10] and tender mercies who satisfyeth thy
[26:13] mouth with good things
[26:15] so that thy youth is renewed
[26:18] like the eagles i pray the lord would
[26:21] add his blessing to the word you may be
[26:23] seated
[26:24] this evening
[26:27] we don't hear as much about healing in
[26:30] 2020
[26:31] even as much as i did when i was a kid
[26:34] divine healing but
[26:35] probably some of you are old enough to
[26:37] remember when divine healing was
[26:39] something that was
[26:41] talked about regularly in the church and
[26:44] we believe in healing but it seems like
[26:46] that
[26:47] maybe we forgot that we needed it
[26:50] and and i'm speaking broadly tonight as
[26:53] as a church
[26:54] as americans especially we begin to feel
[26:56] invincible
[26:58] because everything is is accounted for
[27:01] even if we don't have a cure for it we
[27:03] know what it does and how long we'll
[27:05] have it and if it's going to kill us or
[27:06] not
[27:07] and and all those things and and so you
[27:10] kind of have a general idea
[27:12] and you get a feeling it's bad and you
[27:15] go to the doctor and we thank god for
[27:16] doctors that we're able to do that
[27:19] but this year many of those things
[27:21] change that feeling of invincibility has
[27:23] kind of been lifted from us
[27:26] because uh we don't feel like that we
[27:29] have
[27:30] the answers for this coronavirus we
[27:33] don't feel like
[27:34] that we know exactly what it's going to
[27:36] do and how bad it is if it's
[27:37] good or bad or if it's political or
[27:40] apolitical if it only attacks
[27:42] republicans or democrats or we know that
[27:45] it don't only
[27:46] attack democrats because i had it and
[27:50] but you know
[27:53] but uh we don't bring post not supposed
[27:54] to bring politics in the pulpit but you
[27:56] know
[27:57] we don't know much about it and and we
[28:00] don't have
[28:01] there's no vaccine there's no cure that
[28:03] we know of and
[28:05] especially and no one has immunity to it
[28:07] unless you got it
[28:08] this year already and and those kind of
[28:11] diseases have always
[28:12] existed but in the last hundred years
[28:15] many of them were eradicated and people
[28:16] who grew up in my generation really
[28:18] weren't affected by any of it
[28:21] and so in 2020 something changed we
[28:24] realized
[28:25] we needed god as a healer and we we do
[28:29] need god
[28:30] as a healer and
[28:33] but it's this current crisis that's kept
[28:36] us from that and
[28:37] and yet there are ways that we have of
[28:39] inspiring people's faith and i guess the
[28:41] most frustrating thing for me and
[28:42] just being honest as a minister of the
[28:44] gospel is not being able to deal with it
[28:47] in the way you normally would a sickness
[28:49] because you normally would go and to the
[28:52] person who's sick and and you would go
[28:54] to their home and you would pray with
[28:55] them if they couldn't come or
[28:57] you'd have hands laid on them at the
[28:58] altar but this is a disease that when it
[29:01] strikes it
[29:02] it keeps them away from people and so
[29:05] it makes it very hard for a pastor to do
[29:07] his job
[29:09] it makes it very hard for a church to do
[29:12] what we would normally do usually if
[29:14] there's a lot of
[29:14] sickness going through the church you
[29:16] could have a brethren to preach and
[29:18] maybe it has a gift of healing in his
[29:20] life or or has a special
[29:22] ability to bring up faith among the
[29:24] people and you could have that that
[29:26] preacher in you could bring a group of
[29:28] people together and
[29:29] we our faith could be lifted and and
[29:31] those are ways that we have of dealing
[29:33] with with sickness
[29:34] and inspiring our faith to believe that
[29:37] we are
[29:38] that god's a healer and and yet
[29:41] this year it's hard to do that and if we
[29:44] call it a special meeting it might be a
[29:46] mistake because there
[29:47] you know we might spread the sickness
[29:49] and
[29:50] we uh you can't do it because the
[29:52] sickness spreads through human
[29:54] contact and so so we begin to wonder how
[29:57] do we deal with this
[29:58] but i like this quote that brother
[30:00] branham
[30:01] stated in in what here is now elijah he
[30:03] said god in all ages
[30:05] at all times has always
[30:09] had a way of divine healing always
[30:13] now that's pretty clear isn't it that
[30:16] all ages
[30:17] at all times he's always had a way of
[30:19] divine healing always
[30:22] he said all the way back in the old
[30:24] testament all the way through the new
[30:25] testament down to the new age
[30:27] right to this present time god's had a
[30:30] fountain open
[30:32] listen for those who believe amen and i
[30:36] trust that's
[30:36] us tonight we're the ones who believe
[30:39] for divine healing and
[30:41] and so there's a fountain open in 2020
[30:44] and i want us to
[30:45] understand that tonight god did not
[30:47] leave us in 2020 he didn't
[30:49] pencil that out of his of his of his
[30:51] book he didn't just draw a line through
[30:53] that said no healing in 2020
[30:55] but he's still a healer today just as
[30:58] much as he ever was we just realized we
[31:00] needed it more
[31:02] and so we begin to get desperate for it
[31:04] and and we begin to cry out for healing
[31:06] and that's the hour when he comes around
[31:08] during that darkest hour i think of the
[31:10] man and i mentioned him often but the
[31:12] man of the pool of bethesda how that he
[31:13] waited there
[31:15] and it becomes such a disappointment to
[31:17] him
[31:18] that he'd had this infirmity for 38
[31:20] years
[31:21] and and the pool the angel would visit
[31:24] the pool and the waters would be
[31:25] troubled
[31:25] but he couldn't get down quick enough
[31:28] and brother madam even said that they
[31:29] would
[31:30] stab one another going down to to try to
[31:33] be the first one to get down
[31:35] fight with one another to get down to
[31:37] the pool and he couldn't get down quick
[31:39] enough and
[31:40] he laid there for 38 years disappointed
[31:43] but while he was in his disappointment
[31:45] christ came to him personally and
[31:47] and provided a way for healing
[31:50] when he couldn't get to the healing
[31:51] meeting he couldn't do what you would
[31:53] normally do
[31:54] like everybody else did to get to where
[31:56] the waters were troubled
[31:57] he provided a way and i believe that
[31:59] that same god that same
[32:01] jesus christ that came to him at the
[32:03] pool of bethesda
[32:04] is here tonight to come among in our
[32:07] midst and wherever you are if you're
[32:09] watching or
[32:10] wherever that you're hearing this he's
[32:12] there he's able to come in
[32:14] our midst even when we can't do what we
[32:15] would normally do
[32:17] he's still god and he come to the man
[32:20] and he said if you want to be well
[32:23] will thou be made whole do you want to
[32:25] be well if you want to be well
[32:27] there's a way for you to be well
[32:30] pick up your bed and walk
[32:34] why do we need divine healing today well
[32:37] we don't need divine healing because
[32:39] it's 20 20.
[32:41] we need divine healing because we're
[32:42] humans
[32:44] right and that's the human condition we
[32:47] get
[32:47] sick now genesis 2 17
[32:51] stated that in the day thou eater thou
[32:53] shalt surely dying
[32:55] and so that's what caused all death but
[32:58] it's not that not god's fault
[33:01] it's the fault of the fall the human
[33:04] condition and the devil brings it now
[33:07] brother branham tells us that all
[33:08] sickness he said we have to find first
[33:11] that all sickness came from the devil
[33:13] god is not the author of sickness no
[33:17] sickness comes from god
[33:19] now he said god sometimes permits satan
[33:22] to put sickness on you as a whip to
[33:23] bring you back to the house of god
[33:25] when you've disobeyed but sickness in
[33:27] its beginning
[33:28] come from the devil he said could you
[33:31] imagine a person that would believe that
[33:32] god our heavenly father
[33:34] would be the author of such a thing as
[33:35] sickness and death well no
[33:37] he said he isn't never was never will be
[33:41] god permits death because of
[33:43] disobedience you say well
[33:44] whose disobedience adam's disobedience
[33:48] he's disobedience he permits death
[33:51] because of disobedience
[33:52] god permits death as one writer said all
[33:54] that death can do
[33:56] god harnessed it to a buggy and paul
[33:58] says it pulls us into the presence of
[34:00] god
[34:04] now we know and and you've been taught
[34:06] that the cure for
[34:07] death and disease and sin or it's the
[34:11] same cure is the one for sin
[34:13] which is the atonement made by jesus
[34:15] christ on the cross
[34:17] that's the atonement for sin and when
[34:20] the cure for sin is there then the cure
[34:22] for sickness is there
[34:24] because sin is the root cause of
[34:26] sickness and
[34:28] so first peter 2 24 says who his own
[34:31] self
[34:32] bear our sins in his own body on the
[34:34] tree that we being dead to sins
[34:37] live unto righteousness by whose stripes
[34:40] were healed
[34:41] so we can say we're already healed it's
[34:43] in the atonement
[34:45] and and then if that's the case so why
[34:46] do christians get sick
[34:49] why do christians get sick well it's
[34:51] because the atonement does not
[34:54] affect us in the flesh
[34:57] in a permanent way now i hope you're
[35:00] hearing me because
[35:01] this is important when we get saved as
[35:03] well because you won't always feel
[35:05] saved right you can feel the effect of
[35:08] the atonement
[35:10] when you are saved you get down go down
[35:12] to an altar maybe you're maybe at home
[35:14] or wherever that it was
[35:15] you feel that effect on your flesh but
[35:17] that effect may leave
[35:19] but you're still saved right because
[35:21] that atonement goes down to the soul
[35:24] it takes care of the soul but now when
[35:25] you're healed you'll get sick again
[35:28] and that's just because you're human and
[35:31] it only has a passing effect on the
[35:33] flesh
[35:35] because it's still flesh it's still
[35:37] cursed
[35:38] now brother branham tells us as long as
[35:41] you're in this life he said you're going
[35:43] to be sticky
[35:44] he talked about that that sticky nature
[35:46] he said as long as you're in this life
[35:47] you're going to be sticky
[35:48] and have a carnal nature that's going to
[35:50] bother you
[35:51] as long as you live he said but the
[35:54] inside of you
[35:56] you're born again and when you're raised
[35:58] up and you talk about the resurrection
[36:00] when you're raised up you're in the
[36:01] likeness of christ and all the sin
[36:04] has gone from you he said that's the
[36:06] thing
[36:07] again in conferences he said not only to
[36:09] the healing of the body but healing of
[36:10] the soul
[36:11] also he said which is far more essential
[36:14] than healing the body
[36:15] he said it is possible if you live long
[36:17] enough you get sick again
[36:19] he said because the sickness the bible
[36:21] says many of the afflictions of the
[36:22] righteous but god delivereth them out of
[36:24] them all he said so we have many
[36:27] afflictions promised
[36:29] but a deliverance from them aren't you
[36:32] glad for that
[36:33] many afflictions promised he didn't
[36:36] promise it would be an easy road
[36:38] but he promised deliverance amen
[36:43] now it's something that i have to
[36:45] address because i've seen it
[36:47] and people have said it if someone tells
[36:49] you that if you believe a certain
[36:51] doctrine if you go to a certain church
[36:53] if you see things in the message a
[36:55] certain way
[36:56] that you won't get sick you won't catch
[36:58] covet they're lying to you
[37:02] right they're liars the church you go to
[37:06] has nothing to do with whether or not
[37:08] your flesh can catch coronavirus
[37:12] right or anything else for that matter
[37:16] huh and and you wait you would ask
[37:18] someone like that do you still catch
[37:20] colds
[37:21] because if you still have colds you're
[37:23] still susceptible to viruses
[37:26] right and and so and so they're just not
[37:29] telling the truth but we do have an
[37:31] atonement
[37:33] now in the old testament and i just love
[37:36] the way that this works
[37:37] because in the old testament god did
[37:39] offer to the
[37:40] israelites the ability to be protected
[37:43] from these diseases that come on the
[37:45] egyptians and
[37:46] i want to read that in exodus 15 26 he
[37:49] says
[37:49] and he said if thou wilt diligently
[37:51] hearken to the voice of the lord thy god
[37:54] notice if thou wilt diligently hearken
[37:57] and we'll do that which is right in his
[37:59] sight and we'll give ear to his
[38:01] commandments
[38:02] and keep all his statutes now that's
[38:05] asking a lot
[38:07] he said if you'll do all these things i
[38:10] will put none of these diseases upon me
[38:11] which i brought upon the egyptians for i
[38:13] am the lord
[38:14] that healeth thee now brother branham
[38:16] talked about that that i am the lord
[38:17] that healeth you that's the promise
[38:20] and that promise is apart from what he
[38:22] says i will put none of these diseases
[38:24] on these and i'm the lord that healeth
[38:25] thee
[38:25] brother branham talked about how dr
[38:27] moses had a one prescription
[38:29] and the lord that healeth he could go
[38:31] and whatever was wrong he said if
[38:33] somebody broke their leg if
[38:34] a mother had problem in childbirth
[38:36] whatever it was dr moses just wrote him
[38:38] a prescription i am the lord
[38:39] that healeth thee right and so we can
[38:42] still write that today but
[38:44] if you look at that first part where
[38:45] they he said if you'll do this if you'll
[38:47] do that if you'll do that
[38:49] no one ever kept that part of the
[38:50] bargain very good
[38:53] the israelites sure certainly didn't
[38:57] if you were diligently hearken they
[38:58] complained all the time
[39:01] would do what is right they did
[39:03] everything wrong
[39:05] huh keep all these statutes and they did
[39:07] everything they could to break them
[39:11] and so no one ever kept that part of the
[39:13] bargain and so you find in numbers 21 6
[39:15] that after this
[39:16] that the lord sent fiery serpents among
[39:18] the people and and they bit the people
[39:20] and much people of israel died
[39:23] from a plague of serpents after he said
[39:26] if you'll keep these things but they
[39:28] didn't keep these things
[39:30] right they murmured and they complained
[39:31] and god allowed them to
[39:33] come because of their disobedience and
[39:35] but we find that's the general condition
[39:37] of man
[39:38] in ecclesiastes 7 and 20 says there's
[39:40] not a just man upon earth
[39:42] that doeth good and sinneth not paul
[39:45] said it this way he said all have sinned
[39:46] and come short of the glory of god
[39:50] so you say well i'm protected because of
[39:52] my works no you're not
[39:55] no one's ever been protected but just
[39:56] because of their works
[39:59] but look now but they needed something
[40:03] and i love that god provided them an
[40:05] atonement
[40:07] in spite of their disobedience
[40:10] so healing is not based on works
[40:14] right and many times we get a feeling
[40:16] that well if i could just do this and
[40:17] jump through these hoops and go no
[40:19] healing is based on the atonement
[40:21] not on what we do not even on how much
[40:24] we pray or how much we seek god
[40:27] although that's part of it but it's it's
[40:29] our faith that counts
[40:31] it's how much we can believe god's word
[40:34] how much faith we can have in that
[40:35] atonement now
[40:36] so moses made a serpent of brass and put
[40:39] it on a pole and it came to pass that if
[40:40] a serpent
[40:41] this is in numbers 21 9 if the serpent
[40:43] had bitten any man
[40:45] when he had beheld the serpent of brass
[40:47] he lived
[40:49] what was that an atonement speaking of
[40:52] christ on the cross that sin
[40:54] the serpent would be judged aren't you
[40:56] glad they're still in atonement today
[41:00] but it's not an atonement of works
[41:03] because if the atonement of works had
[41:05] worked they would have never needed
[41:07] the atonement
[41:10] are you with me now now
[41:14] there is a case and we know his message
[41:16] people we've heard you've heard brother
[41:17] branham say it many times that
[41:19] he said pray that there would not be a
[41:20] feeble one among them or he would speak
[41:22] of a church
[41:24] where there could not be a feeble one
[41:25] among them like israel when they entered
[41:28] the promised land he said they had
[41:29] not a feeble one among them in a church
[41:31] like that
[41:32] that's my prayer too i pray tonight that
[41:36] we would leave that way
[41:38] every one of us would leave here healed
[41:41] every one of us we pray that way and i
[41:44] do believe that
[41:45] god will have a church and i know that
[41:47] we we know that at the time of the
[41:49] rapture
[41:50] that there will be a group of people
[41:52] with such faith
[41:54] that they'll take a body change be more
[41:57] than just healing
[41:59] but their whole body is going to change
[42:02] right and that could happen tonight
[42:06] yes it could if it happened tonight then
[42:08] that would be
[42:09] the end of it we would never get sick
[42:10] again
[42:12] amen it could happen tonight but now
[42:17] if it may not happen tonight but you
[42:18] could be healed tonight
[42:20] and we could all be healed there could
[42:21] be such faith rise among us
[42:23] as our faith is inspired by the word
[42:25] that we could all go out healed
[42:27] but now if we did that we'd get sick
[42:29] again
[42:31] right but there's coming a day when it's
[42:34] over
[42:35] amen i'm so glad i'm looking forward to
[42:38] that day
[42:40] now brother madam says i may not have
[42:41] enough faith to make every word of it
[42:43] act he said but i
[42:44] certainly wouldn't stand in the way of
[42:46] anybody that did have that faith
[42:48] he said enoch had faith in us one day to
[42:50] take an afternoon stroll with god
[42:54] amen it's that next slide he said enoch
[42:56] had
[42:57] faith in us to take an afternoon stroll
[42:59] with god and just keep
[43:00] on walking went up home without dying
[43:05] amen that's the kind of faith we need
[43:08] everybody had enough
[43:09] faith that we could he could just walk
[43:10] on home he said now i think the church
[43:14] has got to come to that he said to a
[43:17] rapturing
[43:17] faith he said i may not have that faith
[43:20] just now
[43:21] but i sure wouldn't stand in the way of
[43:23] somebody that did have that faith
[43:26] he said so we trust that god will give
[43:28] us great faith
[43:29] now watch how he takes this so we're
[43:31] looking for that
[43:32] but we trust that god will give us great
[43:34] faith and tomorrow
[43:36] amen he said that there will not be a
[43:38] feeble person left in the building
[43:40] when they come through for prayer he
[43:43] said we'll just believe that
[43:46] so how will we meet the challenge of
[43:49] 2020
[43:50] with divine healing it's by faith in the
[43:52] atonement
[43:54] and that's the same way that we'll have
[43:56] faith for a rapture
[43:58] you can't work yourself into a rapture
[44:01] you make yourself ready because you have
[44:04] the token you have
[44:05] christ within you and he's working
[44:08] through you
[44:09] you're making yourself ready but you're
[44:11] not
[44:12] putting yourself you can't make a
[44:13] rapture happen
[44:16] are you with me now you can't force it
[44:18] to happen but it happens
[44:20] why because rapturing faith comes by
[44:22] rapturing grace
[44:25] brother brown speaks in the countdown of
[44:27] how that the astronauts he said are all
[44:29] wrapped up in christ he says
[44:33] what are they doing they are wrapped in
[44:35] christ
[44:36] in rapturing grace
[44:39] amen what is that that's the atonement
[44:42] they're wrapped in grace that's what he
[44:45] he protects them with
[44:47] don't you see you have that protection
[44:49] today it may not keep you from getting
[44:51] sick but there's healing there
[44:54] and if you ever get it on the soul you
[44:56] don't ever have to worry about it
[44:58] anymore
[45:00] amen so he he said nothing
[45:03] nothing they did themselves i love this
[45:06] this is the astronauts who are ready to
[45:08] blast off to go into another world
[45:10] he said nothing they did themselves
[45:12] christ took the uneducated the foolish
[45:15] things of the world
[45:16] wrapped his astronauts in it and
[45:18] empowered them
[45:19] with the holy ghost to take off
[45:23] amen now again brother branham talks
[45:26] about rapturing grace and three kinds of
[45:27] believers he said that's the reason
[45:29] i do believe when that bride is called
[45:31] out and elected and said in the book of
[45:33] life there will come a sound from heaven
[45:35] that will take such a baptism of the
[45:36] holy spirit into that bride
[45:38] that will take her from the earth in a
[45:40] rapturing grace
[45:45] how do you have rapturing faith by faith
[45:46] in the same atonement
[45:49] right because it's rapturing grace
[45:53] how do we receive divine healing in 2020
[45:57] we come god's provided way and brother
[45:59] branham preached a sermon
[46:02] in 1954 called god's provided way of
[46:05] healing if you're in need of healing or
[46:07] or maybe you you just need your faith to
[46:09] be inspired i recommend you listen to
[46:11] that it's not very long
[46:13] but it's an afternoon service but he
[46:14] said now
[46:16] and this i'm just pulling a few quotes
[46:17] from it but you can go back and listen
[46:19] to the whole thing
[46:20] or read it but he said now when you
[46:22] receive the inspiration that jesus
[46:24] christ
[46:24] died for your sickness it's that very
[46:27] hour that your healing has come
[46:29] now watch and brother branham deals with
[46:31] this that you can't just be
[46:33] uh you can't just believe but your faith
[46:36] has to be inspired
[46:39] right to believe in the right kind of
[46:42] way
[46:42] and brother branham talks about that how
[46:44] that you have mental faith and the
[46:45] subconscious faith he said
[46:47] if you don't have that subconscious
[46:48] faith then have that mental faith until
[46:50] you do have it
[46:52] right and so you never say anything
[46:54] negative you don't say oh i i i'm not
[46:56] healed but you say i am healed
[46:58] you claim that promise but one day then
[47:00] it it drops down with the jt and it's
[47:03] something different
[47:05] then it doesn't matter what what the
[47:07] symptoms are you know you're healed
[47:10] there's some things you just know and
[47:14] nothing could ever
[47:14] shake that amen oh my and so you know
[47:18] that you're healed now
[47:19] he said it's when you're when you
[47:21] receive the inspiration that jesus
[47:22] christ died for your sickness
[47:24] it's that very hour that your healing
[47:26] has come remember faith is a revelation
[47:29] he said that's right when you receive
[47:30] from heaven that jesus died for your
[47:33] sins and you have accepted it
[47:35] you don't need any prayer for you then
[47:38] you've already accepted it it's settled
[47:42] amen he said brother bannon goes into
[47:46] how
[47:46] people's faith is inspired he said now
[47:48] we can preach the word
[47:50] explain the word but you have to receive
[47:52] the word
[47:56] he said that's what sets it a fire
[47:57] brother when you receive it the
[47:59] revelation
[48:00] he said something slips out of the
[48:02] unseen world
[48:04] yonder i love the way he puts this comes
[48:07] rolling down through a mystical channel
[48:09] somewhere
[48:10] into your soul that says
[48:14] now i see it he said your eyes
[48:17] brighten you can
[48:20] you can look and see someone who can see
[48:22] jesus
[48:23] christ died for my sins not just to say
[48:26] it but to really know it
[48:30] the atonement's been made when you get a
[48:32] revelation of that atonement that's been
[48:34] made
[48:34] he said your eyes brighten your lips
[48:36] that hung down straighten up and smile
[48:40] every muscle in your body seems to
[48:43] rejoice
[48:44] why because you caught a revelation
[48:48] amen hallelujah
[48:52] if you catch that revelation it doesn't
[48:53] matter what the devil does to you
[48:56] and it doesn't matter how hard he tries
[48:57] to keep us apart how many church
[48:59] services he can shut down
[49:01] how many meetings that to get cancelled
[49:02] it doesn't matter why you caught a
[49:04] revelation of faith
[49:06] you caught a revelation that he died for
[49:08] you you caught a revelation i'm healed
[49:14] that inspiration strikes now
[49:17] he said something's going to happen you
[49:18] don't need to be in a prayer line then
[49:20] you've got it then
[49:22] and brother branham may think of in
[49:24] perfect faith brother branham said that
[49:25] he said people say they have perfect
[49:27] faith and then come in the prayer line
[49:28] if you had perfect faith you wouldn't
[49:30] need to
[49:31] we need our faith to be inspired that's
[49:33] why we come in a prayer line
[49:35] right but if we had perfect faith we
[49:37] wouldn't have to now
[49:38] he says now that's where if everybody in
[49:41] this building at this time
[49:43] with getting that kind of an attitude
[49:46] every person would be perfectly healed
[49:49] he said now how do we get people that
[49:51] way
[49:52] and that's what's so frustrating about
[49:53] 2020 it's hard to get people in that
[49:55] atmosphere
[49:57] he says how do we get people that way he
[49:59] said some can receive it
[50:00] some cannot receive it but those who can
[50:03] receive it they look at it and accept it
[50:05] and believe it he said others maybe in
[50:08] another meeting
[50:10] he said now that's one way he said of
[50:12] preaching it by the word
[50:13] that's what i'm doing tonight one way of
[50:15] preaching it by the word he said another
[50:17] way is maybe somebody speak with tongues
[50:19] he said they give an interpretation to
[50:20] reveal the secrets of their heart
[50:22] he said or maybe there'd be someone who
[50:24] was a prophet would stand and
[50:26] do something in the supernatural that
[50:28] you look up and say oh
[50:30] there it is there it is he said then
[50:33] something happens to you
[50:35] now again and this is farther down in
[50:38] the same message he said remember
[50:40] when god is making his revelation
[50:42] revealing himself to the to his people
[50:44] he said now that's the benefit of the
[50:46] meetings
[50:48] that's what god gave the gifts for was
[50:50] to magnify him
[50:53] and that's when healing can come is when
[50:55] we magnify him
[50:57] right we make him king not ourselves not
[51:00] our own ideas our own priorities but we
[51:02] make him king
[51:04] he said and that's when healing can come
[51:06] he said
[51:07] and he said that's what god gives the
[51:09] gifts for was to magnify him and to
[51:10] unify the people
[51:12] and to bring the body together he says
[51:15] and to help us to unite our efforts
[51:17] and our prayers he said a person sitting
[51:20] in a group of people like
[51:22] this where faith is gathered on every
[51:24] side
[51:25] it'll help you to get well
[51:30] and people want to draw away more and
[51:32] more from the house of god but look he
[51:33] said it'll help you get well
[51:37] why it inspires your faith
[51:40] you remember brother branham talking
[51:41] about how that he would he would discern
[51:42] and someone would have heart trouble
[51:44] and then that those demons would begin
[51:46] to cry out for help
[51:47] and they they'd receive strength from
[51:49] other demons all over the building
[51:52] right and the devil was dumb really
[51:54] because it really just identified where
[51:56] he was
[51:57] right so prophet could see it but now
[52:01] they would crowd and help one another
[52:02] but don't you realize faith works the
[52:03] same way
[52:04] and when we gather together and with
[52:06] people sitting on every side
[52:08] it helps you get well why because your
[52:10] faith inspired somebody else's faith
[52:13] maybe they didn't come with the faith
[52:14] that they needed and it's been a hard
[52:16] week and
[52:16] things have been rough and they've been
[52:18] coughing and and and everything's been
[52:20] going wrong and their body's sick
[52:22] but when they sit in the presence of god
[52:24] suddenly your faith inspired somebody
[52:26] else's faith inspires
[52:27] somebody else's faith pretty soon
[52:29] there's healing going on so we still
[52:32] believe in that
[52:35] right and so he said where faith is
[52:37] getting gathered on every side that'll
[52:38] help you to get well there there'll be
[52:40] people
[52:41] he said who listens at the word being
[52:43] taught
[52:44] amen in that kind of an atmosphere
[52:47] there'll be people who listen to the
[52:48] word being taught that'll never be in a
[52:50] prayer line
[52:51] yet they'll get well amen
[52:55] for something happens subconsciously
[52:58] maybe
[52:58] that they don't even realize what it's
[53:00] about
[53:02] he said they'll get well somebody
[53:04] sitting and watch one of the signs of
[53:06] the lord appear and
[53:07] they'll get well he said see when it's
[53:08] when faith anything
[53:10] he said that can stimulate that faith
[53:14] on down but the brother said now these
[53:16] meetings and people gathering he said
[53:17] that's what it's for
[53:19] it's to encourage faith to bring faith
[53:22] up
[53:22] we couldn't heal certainly not but we
[53:24] have a part in doing it
[53:26] he said that's preaching the gospel
[53:27] that's one part in doing it
[53:29] another part would be speaking in
[53:30] tongues that's in part if it's by
[53:32] revelation
[53:33] he said a gift of prophecy that's
[53:34] another of that
[53:36] he said then signs and wonders and
[53:37] everything is gifts and everything in
[53:39] the church
[53:40] to stimulate the church to keep the
[53:42] church together
[53:44] for every attribute of jesus life
[53:47] until he returns again in glory and how
[53:49] many times have we seen that
[53:51] you'll be in a meeting or at a place
[53:53] where god will be moving maybe it's just
[53:54] a regular church service but others are
[53:56] there
[53:56] and you see someone really get blessed
[53:58] by god and you watch it begin to spread
[54:02] right and that's why we do that
[54:06] to inspire our faith to stimulate our
[54:08] faith
[54:10] but how do we do that in 2020
[54:14] look it's kind of a downer isn't it
[54:17] now we're doing that tonight but there's
[54:19] not people sitting all around you
[54:22] some of you sitting six feet away and
[54:23] more from everybody else
[54:27] and we try to be as careful as we can
[54:29] here and i'll say as a church i think
[54:30] we've
[54:31] we've done everything we can and you
[54:33] can't stop everything but
[54:34] we we've the lord has blessed us to keep
[54:36] it from just running
[54:38] roughshod through the church and and
[54:39] having to shut down again and i pray
[54:41] it'll continue that way
[54:43] of course it's helped that i already had
[54:44] it and and so
[54:46] it's you know i'd be the one and i feel
[54:48] i would feel terrible spreading it to
[54:50] anyone
[54:50] but haven't already had it i don't feel
[54:52] as bad about that although they say you
[54:54] could
[54:54] may be able to catch it again but you're
[54:57] human you'll get sick again
[55:00] right but every time we try to do
[55:03] something in 2020 it gets canceled
[55:08] do you see why i'm just preaching from
[55:11] my heart tonight but
[55:13] do you see why we try so hard to get
[55:15] people in the house of god
[55:17] and preachers if they don't watch it
[55:18] will get so careful about that and
[55:21] so bothered by the people that don't
[55:22] come that they it destroys their
[55:24] ministry
[55:25] they can't preach to people that are
[55:27] there and i strive not to do that but
[55:29] it's
[55:29] you don't want people to come just
[55:30] because you want them to hear you but
[55:32] you know if they come
[55:34] they can be inspired
[55:38] if they'll just come
[55:41] and that's why one of the best ways we
[55:42] can witness is just invite people to
[55:43] church
[55:45] come and see as the woman at the well
[55:48] said come and see
[55:50] amen and so there's something here
[55:54] among us that we believe god can move in
[55:56] our midst but
[55:59] many church services have been canceled
[56:00] meetings have been canceled
[56:02] but the atonement is still there
[56:05] you see these other things are just to
[56:07] inspire our faith but the atonement
[56:09] is still the same right
[56:12] it didn't get taken away
[56:16] and as i thought about these things and
[56:18] i won't hold you very long tonight but
[56:20] just just
[56:20] now think deeply with me for a moment
[56:23] why would god allow this to come where
[56:25] we couldn't
[56:26] maybe have our faith inspired the way we
[56:28] would want to
[56:30] during a time when we really needed it
[56:34] but you look at it and in matthew 8 and
[56:35] 8 it says the centurion
[56:37] and this is the one who come to jesus
[56:39] and he said my
[56:40] my servant is really sick and jesus said
[56:42] i'll come to him and the centurion
[56:44] answered and said lord
[56:45] i'm not worthy that thou should come
[56:47] under my roof
[56:48] but speak the word only my servant shall
[56:52] be healed
[56:54] i want to deal with that for a moment
[56:56] because this is divine
[56:58] healing in 2020 we may not be able to we
[57:00] may be frustrated in our attempts
[57:02] sometimes to do
[57:03] all that we want to do and be able to
[57:07] gather together like we want
[57:09] but he says speak the word only
[57:13] now when brother branham he had third
[57:15] three polls in his
[57:16] ministry in his healing ministry in
[57:18] three polls in his ministry his first
[57:20] poll was
[57:21] the sign in the hand and the second poll
[57:23] was discernment
[57:25] and visions and the third poll was the
[57:27] opening of the word which was identified
[57:29] by the spoken word
[57:31] right i think we could all agree on that
[57:32] now
[57:35] so brother branham talks about that
[57:36] third poll
[57:39] and he speaks of how what it is in
[57:42] watchmen one of the night he said how
[57:43] many is in the building tonight that
[57:45] remember when i first come up the west
[57:46] coast he said down to the south and
[57:48] he said just had that one ministry of
[57:50] laying laying of hands
[57:52] he said can you remember that just look
[57:54] at the friends he said all right
[57:55] he said then did i tell you that the
[57:57] lord told me there would be another
[57:58] ministry
[57:59] he said you remember that which would be
[58:01] the discerning of the thoughts of the
[58:02] heart and so forth
[58:04] he said well then ministries have worked
[58:05] perfectly the world around
[58:07] see one went its day the other
[58:10] one lived its day now brother branham
[58:13] even up to the end of his life still
[58:15] used all three
[58:17] he would show the people that he still
[58:19] had the sign in the hand
[58:21] he still had saw the visions called the
[58:24] people out showed that the sign
[58:26] of the son of man and the sign of the
[58:28] resurrection he showed those things
[58:31] but now something more was coming on
[58:34] but here's what's interesting is that as
[58:37] it become
[58:37] more and more
[58:41] real and more and more powerful the
[58:43] greatest part of his ministry
[58:45] was also the part where the pentecostals
[58:47] thought he lost it
[58:50] and the greatest part of his ministry
[58:53] was when it seemed like less people were
[58:55] healed than ever before
[58:57] and a man who'd who'd seen thousands
[59:00] come by a prayer line in jonesboro
[59:02] all of a sudden he's talking about fish
[59:04] that got healed
[59:06] resurrected possums
[59:10] right and if you're a pentecostal
[59:13] mover and shaker of that day you you
[59:16] could be forgiven maybe for
[59:18] thinking man why don't you get focused
[59:21] you know and they said they said you do
[59:22] the prayers the
[59:24] prayer lines wrong and everything like
[59:25] that and brother random ask the angel of
[59:27] the lord
[59:28] how should i do it he said just as you
[59:29] feel led
[59:31] so brother branham would try different
[59:33] things and do it different ways but he
[59:34] always come back to that now watch
[59:36] the first one they had to be very close
[59:38] to him he had to touch him i believe was
[59:39] in his left hand
[59:40] he had to he had to grab hold of him
[59:44] with the visions he didn't have to grab
[59:45] hold of them
[59:47] in fact there were many and we've we've
[59:48] witnessed that with many people with
[59:50] testimonies that they'd be at the back
[59:51] of the church
[59:52] never met him and he'd call them out and
[59:54] tell them what their name was where they
[59:56] come from that they were healed
[59:58] and god used that to build their faith
[59:59] for divine healing
[1:00:01] right along with showing the sign of the
[1:00:03] son of man now
[1:00:05] he knows the secrets of our heart but
[1:00:07] the spoken word was different
[1:00:10] because it was in secret he said it
[1:00:14] won't be a public show
[1:00:16] so he says then he says
[1:00:19] them ministries worked perfectly the
[1:00:20] world round then that next quote he said
[1:00:22] now a little later on if i get a chance
[1:00:24] he said what i i want to tell you what
[1:00:26] happened just recently bringing in a new
[1:00:27] ministry
[1:00:28] he said i'll just speak the word listen
[1:00:31] what he says and it puts it right back
[1:00:33] into the lap of the people again
[1:00:40] now listen what he says if they will
[1:00:42] come with the right attitude and belief
[1:00:45] it's got to happen
[1:00:49] and so what instigated it with hattie
[1:00:50] wright was hattie wright said it's
[1:00:52] nothing but the truth
[1:00:56] what was it they said she said the right
[1:00:59] thing now
[1:01:00] if they will come with the right
[1:01:01] attitude and believe now brother branham
[1:01:03] speaks of a time when the third poll
[1:01:04] will be fully manifested and i want us
[1:01:06] to
[1:01:06] to look at this and sometimes we shy
[1:01:08] away from these quotes because they're
[1:01:09] so badly misunderstood
[1:01:11] but i want to read these tonight because
[1:01:14] because people will take this and they
[1:01:15] look for brother branham to come back
[1:01:16] and do it but look what god was doing
[1:01:19] he was moving from the sign of the hand
[1:01:21] to the visions
[1:01:23] a greater distance to the spoken word
[1:01:26] speak the word only the servants miles
[1:01:28] away
[1:01:30] right and and so he's moving a distance
[1:01:33] from the man
[1:01:34] and brother brown would say things like
[1:01:36] who did she touch
[1:01:38] who did he touch amen we have a high
[1:01:42] priest that can be touched
[1:01:44] by the feeling of our infirmity
[1:01:47] right now brother branham speaks for
[1:01:50] that time he said now remember there
[1:01:51] will never be an impersonation of that
[1:01:54] because it can't be he said now it's in
[1:01:56] existence he said i've
[1:01:58] i've warned of this that soon he said
[1:02:01] right at this time now it's just
[1:02:02] happened
[1:02:03] so it could identify its presence among
[1:02:06] you
[1:02:07] but it will not be used in a great way
[1:02:09] until this council begins to tighten up
[1:02:12] he said and when it does he said the
[1:02:13] pentecostals and so forth can almost
[1:02:15] impersonate anything can be done
[1:02:18] but when that time comes when the
[1:02:20] squeeze comes down he said then you'll
[1:02:22] see
[1:02:23] what you've seen temporarily be
[1:02:25] manifested in the fullness of its power
[1:02:29] again in shalom but the brown says we
[1:02:31] all know that's the identification we
[1:02:32] know what the third poll is
[1:02:34] he said we all understand that he said
[1:02:36] now you've got you'll have the tape see
[1:02:38] he said i think it'll just lay dormant
[1:02:39] for a little while
[1:02:41] until the great hour of persecution
[1:02:42] comes on he said that's when it be that
[1:02:45] it'll speak
[1:02:46] it'll be manifested just like the five
[1:02:48] straight signs without failure
[1:02:50] perfectly now if you look at the nature
[1:02:54] of it and we'll look at it in just a
[1:02:56] moment
[1:02:56] of that spoken word the thing about it
[1:02:59] is people say well then brother branham
[1:03:00] has to come back and and do that no
[1:03:02] because
[1:03:02] the thing about the third poll is it's
[1:03:04] in you
[1:03:07] the word is in you it's in me
[1:03:11] are you with me now yes it was in a
[1:03:14] prophet he said that's identifying him
[1:03:15] but
[1:03:16] it'll lay dormant for a while but
[1:03:17] there's something coming
[1:03:20] oh he said to be at a time of the
[1:03:21] squeeze and people misunderstand the
[1:03:22] squeeze i've always
[1:03:24] always thought this because of the
[1:03:26] nature of
[1:03:27] of the age that we live in we live in
[1:03:28] laodicea
[1:03:31] and if we look at a squeeze as just the
[1:03:32] persecution of people well
[1:03:34] there are some countries where they're
[1:03:35] being persecuted
[1:03:37] many countries and so you have to be
[1:03:38] careful when you draw a line and say
[1:03:40] well
[1:03:40] when the squeeze comes then they'll just
[1:03:42] shut us all up brother
[1:03:43] said before they shut us up we'll go up
[1:03:47] people misunderstand in daniel 11 32 it
[1:03:49] says such as do wickedly against the
[1:03:51] covenant
[1:03:51] should be corrupt by flatteries
[1:03:54] how will they be corrupt by flatteries
[1:03:58] that's how he gets them you know the
[1:04:01] remarkable thing about job was not all
[1:04:03] the trials he endured
[1:04:04] he said he was a rich man and was a
[1:04:06] perfect man
[1:04:08] do you ever think about that job was one
[1:04:11] of the wealthiest men in the world at
[1:04:13] that time
[1:04:14] and served god with a perfect heart
[1:04:17] no wonder god could trust him
[1:04:21] because a rich man will hardly even
[1:04:23] enter the kingdom of heaven
[1:04:26] but job was a rich man but he was a
[1:04:27] perfect man and so god knew when he took
[1:04:29] all that away he'd still serve him
[1:04:32] because he'd already been tested by the
[1:04:33] wealth
[1:04:36] are you with me now now he said he'll
[1:04:39] corrupt by flatteries but the people
[1:04:40] that do know their god should be strong
[1:04:42] and do exploits and the feast of the
[1:04:45] trumpets brother brown says
[1:04:47] and and this is i've referenced lately
[1:04:49] so i wanted to bring the quote so that
[1:04:50] you don't
[1:04:50] you know and i know i've used it before
[1:04:52] he said notice there she is now she's
[1:04:54] loosed
[1:04:55] he's talking about the demons loosed in
[1:04:57] the ecclesiastical realm
[1:04:59] out of the euphrates river he said it
[1:05:01] was loosed in a in a natural way
[1:05:03] on the jews lost in an ecclesiastical
[1:05:06] realm
[1:05:06] on the bride but he said there
[1:05:10] there she is now she's loosed to do what
[1:05:13] to call all these little loose ends oh
[1:05:16] well don't make any difference anyhow
[1:05:20] no we're real close to that squeeze
[1:05:25] we still got money in the bank we still
[1:05:27] got most of us doing
[1:05:29] we still got things that that you know
[1:05:31] you might be poor there's poor and
[1:05:32] there's rich but
[1:05:33] but for the most part we live pretty
[1:05:35] good whenever we think we don't we need
[1:05:37] to take a trip to a third world country
[1:05:40] and you find out we do just look across
[1:05:42] the border to mexico
[1:05:44] and you'll find out we do live pretty
[1:05:45] good but we've seen this attitude it
[1:05:48] doesn't make any difference
[1:05:50] we've seen that we've seen that right
[1:05:54] among us
[1:05:55] no matter what i do don't make any
[1:05:58] difference what the message says
[1:05:59] don't make any difference with these
[1:06:01] little loose sins that a prophet of
[1:06:02] malachi 4 a prophet of revelation 10 7
[1:06:05] come to tie those two sins together to
[1:06:07] finish the mystery of god it doesn't
[1:06:08] matter
[1:06:09] what anybody what what it says don't
[1:06:11] make any difference anyhow
[1:06:13] people say well he was just a lying
[1:06:14] prophet people that preached the message
[1:06:16] for years
[1:06:17] turn their backs on it
[1:06:20] we're close to that are you with me now
[1:06:26] and here's you can take this for what
[1:06:28] it's worth if it's a seed spit it out
[1:06:29] but i believe when it changes
[1:06:31] from flatteries to force because it will
[1:06:33] change
[1:06:34] we go home because he won't let his
[1:06:37] bride go through
[1:06:38] that persecution that tribulation period
[1:06:40] now when the squirrels
[1:06:42] were spoken into existence brother
[1:06:43] branham was thinking about this
[1:06:44] scripture in mark chapter 11 verse 23
[1:06:47] he said for verily i say unto you that
[1:06:48] whosoever shall say unto this mountain
[1:06:50] be thou removed be thou cast into the
[1:06:53] sea and shall not doubt in his heart but
[1:06:54] shall believe that these things
[1:06:56] those things which he says shall come to
[1:06:57] pass he shall have whatsoever he saith
[1:07:00] he said whosoever shall say this is mark
[1:07:03] 11 23 whosoever shall say
[1:07:06] to this mountain you know there's no
[1:07:10] song that
[1:07:11] was taken that said whosoever includes
[1:07:13] me surely means me
[1:07:15] surely being with me
[1:07:18] you know you apply that to this
[1:07:19] whosoever is pretty broad
[1:07:24] whosoever that's the scripture that
[1:07:26] brother branham is pondering
[1:07:28] and he deals with that in perfect faith
[1:07:30] he's talking about those squirrels and
[1:07:31] things and
[1:07:32] during the sermon and then he says now
[1:07:34] he said when the same god comes to you
[1:07:36] he said and is pleased to dwell in you
[1:07:39] you're speaking how he's pleased to
[1:07:41] dwell in his son
[1:07:42] jesus christ he said he's pleased to
[1:07:43] dwell on you please to honor
[1:07:45] your word what your decision is
[1:07:49] he said what was joshua's decision stand
[1:07:51] still son and it stood there
[1:07:55] bad you remember the angel told
[1:07:58] brother branhammer that voice spoke to
[1:07:59] him and said make your decision
[1:08:02] he didn't tell him how many he said make
[1:08:05] your decision
[1:08:07] joshua's decision was stand still son
[1:08:10] and it stood there
[1:08:12] amen what was moses decision he held his
[1:08:14] stick over a river and called for it to
[1:08:16] open and it opened
[1:08:17] remember he said why cry speak
[1:08:21] he said see whatever you ask see that
[1:08:24] works in 2020.
[1:08:27] amen he said whatever you ask and if you
[1:08:30] say to this mountain be moved and don't
[1:08:32] doubt see in your heart
[1:08:33] but believe that what you said will come
[1:08:35] to pass you can have what you said
[1:08:39] now brother branham makes a remarkable
[1:08:41] statement here he said that puts you
[1:08:43] back in the word
[1:08:47] amen that puts you back in the word
[1:08:51] so the third poll was not about brother
[1:08:52] branham coming back and and
[1:08:54] and showing us the sign of the third
[1:08:55] poll he already showed it to us
[1:08:58] but it puts you back in the word
[1:09:02] he said now that's not skim milk it puts
[1:09:05] you back
[1:09:07] he said i know it's going to jump right
[1:09:08] over top of you maybe
[1:09:10] he said see because it can't anchor oh
[1:09:12] i'm so glad
[1:09:13] there's a people prepared today for it
[1:09:15] to anchor him
[1:09:16] there's got to be during this time he
[1:09:19] said but real
[1:09:20] genuine faith catches that right now
[1:09:23] puts you back in the word that night
[1:09:27] after preaching this was astounded me
[1:09:30] the other day when i realized this
[1:09:32] god didn't do anything by accident but
[1:09:33] iran preaches perfect faith and i was
[1:09:35] discussing that with my brother joel
[1:09:37] talking about how brother brandon
[1:09:38] preached that and he said well that
[1:09:40] night
[1:09:40] he preached he that is in you and it
[1:09:44] just
[1:09:44] hit me it just struck me
[1:09:48] brother branham is continuing on in the
[1:09:50] same thought he talks about it again and
[1:09:51] he that is in you he said when thou
[1:09:53] prayest
[1:09:54] believe that you receive what you ask
[1:09:55] for it shall be given to you if you say
[1:09:57] to this mountain be moved and no doubt
[1:09:58] in your heart
[1:09:59] but believe that what you say will come
[1:10:00] to pass you can have what you say
[1:10:02] the father worketh and i worketh
[1:10:04] hitherto verily verily i send you the
[1:10:05] son could do nothing
[1:10:06] in himself but what he sees the father
[1:10:08] doing that do it the son likewise
[1:10:11] he said see and when the father showed
[1:10:12] him what to do
[1:10:14] walked out there without a failure of
[1:10:16] anything
[1:10:17] and said let it be and it was
[1:10:23] amen and that same
[1:10:26] christ amen the next slide
[1:10:29] i want you to see it that same christ
[1:10:32] lives in you very bad
[1:10:36] he makes it very clear he said he lives
[1:10:37] in us
[1:10:39] then his works will do because christ is
[1:10:42] the word and the promise of the word
[1:10:46] brings healing to you
[1:10:52] so to elevate your faith to inspire your
[1:10:54] faith what did he do in this hour
[1:10:56] he opened up the entire book
[1:11:00] he opened up the whole book and when we
[1:11:03] look at and realize who we are
[1:11:05] that that same christ lives in us
[1:11:08] our faith is inspired not just by people
[1:11:11] around us that's wonderful we still use
[1:11:13] that not by just a prayer line and a
[1:11:15] bunch of ministers laying hands on us
[1:11:16] that's wonderful
[1:11:17] we'll still use that we'll still
[1:11:20] continue those things as long as the
[1:11:21] lord let us those are biblical things
[1:11:23] not just by a prayer cloth but we'll be
[1:11:25] inspired to speak
[1:11:30] because that same christ lives in you it
[1:11:32] lives in us then his works will do
[1:11:34] because christ is the word
[1:11:35] and the promise of the word brings
[1:11:37] healing to you
[1:11:42] i wonder if in 2020 brother joe
[1:11:46] he wanted us to know what it was like
[1:11:50] to speak make a decision
[1:11:54] and walk in it
[1:11:58] without without any support
[1:12:02] at times when it seemed like the whole
[1:12:04] world's going crazy
[1:12:06] but you're walking right in the middle
[1:12:07] of the storm
[1:12:10] so you had to bring the storm where a
[1:12:11] prophet couldn't have stealed the storm
[1:12:13] you can't speak to the storm unless
[1:12:15] there's a storm there
[1:12:18] well i hope you're hearing me i'm not
[1:12:19] saying that 2020 is the year or that
[1:12:21] coronavirus is the storm
[1:12:23] now hear me i'm not saying that but what
[1:12:25] if it was
[1:12:26] then if it was he would inspire your
[1:12:28] faith to speak to that storm
[1:12:31] are you with me now there will be a
[1:12:34] storm there'll have to be a storm
[1:12:35] that comes that's why he said it'll
[1:12:37] happen during the squeeze there's got to
[1:12:38] be a
[1:12:39] storm that comes so you can speak to the
[1:12:41] storm
[1:12:42] there's got to be trials coming you'll
[1:12:44] never know what it's like just walk in
[1:12:46] faith you got to know what it's like
[1:12:48] sometimes to not have the money in the
[1:12:50] bank
[1:12:50] you got to know what it's like sometimes
[1:12:52] to not have the the health in your body
[1:12:54] you got to know what it's like why
[1:12:55] because you got to walk in it
[1:12:57] there's no storm you can't speak to it
[1:13:01] if there's no need the need can't be met
[1:13:07] i hope you're hearing it tonight now
[1:13:10] brother branham says
[1:13:12] the promise of the word brings healing
[1:13:14] to you he says i will not live
[1:13:16] leave you comfortless
[1:13:19] he said as i pray i asked a while ago in
[1:13:20] matthew 24 28 20 he said
[1:13:23] i will come to you be in you i the
[1:13:25] person
[1:13:26] christ in the form of the holy ghost
[1:13:28] will come
[1:13:29] and live in you he said then you won't
[1:13:32] be
[1:13:32] yourself no more i'll be in you
[1:13:37] and greater is he that's in you than he
[1:13:40] that sent the world
[1:13:43] greater is he that's in you than
[1:13:45] coronavirus
[1:13:47] because coronavirus couldn't even be
[1:13:49] here unless god had a meeting with
[1:13:52] the devil had a meeting with god and
[1:13:54] went before him and asked permission
[1:13:57] to send it right whether it come from a
[1:14:01] bat whether it comes from a chinese lab
[1:14:03] however it come from whatever the way
[1:14:05] the devil got it into the human race
[1:14:07] before it could come the devil had to go
[1:14:10] ask permission
[1:14:14] then if the devil asked permission then
[1:14:15] there must be a people who have proven
[1:14:18] during these the time like job that they
[1:14:20] would stand for
[1:14:22] and then he said if you take it all away
[1:14:23] they'll still stand for me
[1:14:26] amen amen
[1:14:30] what does it make you makes you a
[1:14:32] warrior
[1:14:33] it makes you somebody who can stand in
[1:14:36] spite of difficulty
[1:14:38] i'm closing with this what if he wants
[1:14:39] to prove to you
[1:14:42] that you have the power to speak the
[1:14:43] word
[1:14:45] and even the mountain of coronavirus or
[1:14:47] whatever else that it is will be moved
[1:14:49] he said well it took me two weeks to
[1:14:51] recover of it but you're healed
[1:14:56] you're healed
[1:14:59] what what you look at it and think i'm
[1:15:01] not trying to downplay it i know
[1:15:03] personally but
[1:15:04] i know how hard it is these other
[1:15:06] brothers can tell you how hard it is
[1:15:08] and the sisters that have had it could
[1:15:09] tell you it's nothing to laugh at
[1:15:11] something to respect but greater is he
[1:15:13] that's in you
[1:15:15] then he whoever he is that's in the
[1:15:18] world
[1:15:19] and if god can stop a storm he can stop
[1:15:22] the sickness
[1:15:25] but maybe he's waiting on a bride to
[1:15:27] speak
[1:15:30] let's bow our heads together musicians
[1:15:32] come
[1:15:33] maybe that's a little different than
[1:15:34] what you thought but that's divine
[1:15:36] healing in 2020.
[1:15:38] god has a way he always
[1:15:41] had a way brother brown said that always
[1:15:43] i believe four times in that quote he
[1:15:45] always has a way of bringing his people
[1:15:47] divine healing
[1:15:49] would you just talk to the lord for a
[1:15:51] moment we're going to have a
[1:15:53] a time of prayer together
[1:15:56] where there's a lot of sickness going on
[1:15:57] and you don't know how helpless it makes
[1:15:59] me feel as a pastor
[1:16:00] to not be able to address some of these
[1:16:02] things and i told brother joe the other
[1:16:04] day i said you know what
[1:16:05] i'm tired of you know we know god's a
[1:16:07] healer but i'm ready to see some healing
[1:16:09] i see god begin to move
[1:16:12] i'm ready for that i believe i believe
[1:16:14] our faith is ready for that
[1:16:16] let's let's take whatever steps are
[1:16:19] necessary and
[1:16:20] see that happen but i've seen god move
[1:16:22] i've seen him step up in many
[1:16:24] many ways but he's not we're not waiting
[1:16:27] on him the hour is here
[1:16:29] he's waiting on us let's just talk to
[1:16:33] him for a moment
[1:16:34] and you just in your own way just just
[1:16:35] talk to god and say lord
[1:16:37] lord i inspire my faith whatever it
[1:16:41] takes i want my faith to be inspired i
[1:16:43] may not be able to go to a meeting i may
[1:16:45] not be able to do that but but i have a
[1:16:46] word that's been opened to me in this
[1:16:48] hour
[1:16:49] you he spoke there's a voice that you
[1:16:51] can still listen to there's still a
[1:16:53] there's still a prophet in the land if
[1:16:55] you could say it that way the holy ghost
[1:16:56] is still here
[1:16:57] he's still inspiring his people then
[1:17:00] just ask him lord inspire my
[1:17:02] faith tonight quicken my faith bring it
[1:17:04] to life so that i can
[1:17:05] see healing in my body and in my friends
[1:17:08] and my family those around me heavenly
[1:17:09] father
[1:17:10] lord god we believe in healing we
[1:17:12] believe that you're the healer
[1:17:14] we believe that you're the savior of our
[1:17:16] souls lord
[1:17:18] we believe that you lord made the
[1:17:20] atonement
[1:17:21] for us oh god we're trusting in that
[1:17:24] atonement today
[1:17:26] we come not not by our own works lord
[1:17:29] but we come according to faith
[1:17:31] lord i i want to reach out and touch
[1:17:34] every person but lord
[1:17:36] it may inspire their faith if a man can
[1:17:38] touch them but how much
[1:17:39] more lord would it inspire our faith if
[1:17:42] we could feel that touch from you
[1:17:44] tonight if we could know that you're a
[1:17:46] high priest that
[1:17:47] is touched by the feeling of our
[1:17:48] infirmity oh god
[1:17:50] may we catch that revelation tonight of
[1:17:52] who you are
[1:17:53] may there be a reality in our lives lord
[1:17:56] has a church that
[1:17:57] you died for us some lord
[1:18:00] has said that that's too simple but they
[1:18:03] don't realize it's the very third poll
[1:18:04] itself
[1:18:06] lord to bring us to a place that we can
[1:18:08] see that you're still living you're
[1:18:10] still here
[1:18:12] you're not just the god of yesterday but
[1:18:14] until we have a revelation of what your
[1:18:16] atonement did
[1:18:17] we can't we can't go move on we can't
[1:18:19] have healing but lord we want that
[1:18:21] revelation today
[1:18:22] more so than we've ever had oh god would
[1:18:25] you just move in our midst

[1:18:28] in need i pray especially for those here
[1:18:30] in the church lord

[1:18:52] make a decision lord and step forward
[1:18:54] and speak
[1:18:55] your lord in your name we believe that
[1:18:57] it'll happen
[1:18:58] god i pray for those lord we see the
[1:19:01] attack on the ministry in this hour

[1:19:37] that the time would come whether we'd
[1:19:39] have so much faith we just walk off the
[1:19:41] earth

[1:19:45] even tonight lord

[1:19:50] hearts

[1:20:14] made a way
[1:20:15] lord for the children of israel when
[1:20:18] when the snake was biting when the
[1:20:19] plague was in the land
