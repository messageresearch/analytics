whatever they may be i pray god that you would speak through me today or though it's kind of a different uh large service with what the weather coming in but lord i pray you take us out of ourselves just for a moment and speak to us god we're we didn't come here because of the weather or something else or lord to be told something uh of the world but we came here to hear your word lord and and to draw closer to you and i pray you to help us to do that today speak to us lord move me out of the way and may you speak lord in jesus name amen amen do you love him this morning amen it's valentine's day and of course we can think of no greater love than the love of jesus christ for his for his bride and i trust that you'll do something special for your spouse for your loved one on valentine's day i appreciate my wife very much and and uh over the years she's put up with a lot from me as far as being uh gone and and uh preaching and and putting the ministry first as you have to do to be a minister but i'm so grateful for my wife that stood by me through all of that and and uh hope she has a good day and and do something special for your wife today if you have a chance i'm going to be reading from philippians chapter 1 and verse 20. i want to thank you for your prayers for my grandmother uh passing away for the family uh that funeral will be next saturday uh in alberto springs missouri and i'll have to speak at that funeral so i won't be back on sunday brother brayden savage is actually going to come and and speak to us he did a wonderful job the last time he was here and so he's the lord willing he'll be back next sunday i don't know about wednesday night service yet we're supposed to have another round of weather coming in but we'll let you know if we can have church we'll have church and otherwise we'll let you know and but we want to take advantage of the opportunity that we have here amen and but about my my grandmother was a good woman and her and my grandfather the reason why we're in the message today and you know people can make many mistakes in their lives but at the same time if they weren't there you wouldn't be here and that was my grandmother and and she was a wonderful woman and when you see my mother then you see my grandmother the way my mom is and how she puts her family first that's the way my grandmother was and so we'll miss her but we believe there's a glad reunion day coming do you believe that today if we don't believe that i've thought a lot about that lately where paul says if in this life only i have hope i am of all men most miserable but there's a resurrection day coming there there's a day coming we're actually going to see he said brother ben how can you say that how can you prove that i know it it's an absolute in my life amen there's going to be a time we'll see our loved ones and this message makes that so real to us we thank god for that philippians 1 and 20 according to my earnest expectation and my hope that in nothing i shall be ashamed but that with all boldness as always so now also christ shall be magnified in my body whether it be by life or by death for to me to live is christ and to die is gain amen what an absolute paul had for me to live is christ and to die is gain i pray the lord would add his blessing to the word you may be seated there's never been a more radical change in the life of a man than in the life of paul when he was saul the pharisee he persecuted the church with all the fervor that he had with all the uh all the integrity that he could summon he had zeal uh beyond what uh what you would even think is normal or natural to do that he was as uh as we would say he was as entrenched in that pharisaic interpretation of the scriptures as what you could be had been taught by the greatest teacher of that day gamaliel and yet when he met god one time one time he met god and when he did it all changed and i'll just tell you this morning that if you ever meet god and we can work with you and i i'd be glad to and and so many times we work with people we try to get them to a place where they understand and they believe this message but if you could ever meet christ if you could ever find out what he is to you and what he means to your life things would change you don't have to tell a person who's met christ that he has to do this and that and the other he'll see it in the word and when he sees it he'll come to it because he met christ and so we have to get people to christ and paul in the book of philippians his singular focus had become christ and his will for his life and it was written from his prison cell in rome and in philippians chapter three just to kind of give you an example of how he's writing and the focus of his life he warns the church to beware of those who would bring them back under the bondage of the law and then he says in verse 4 he says though i might also have confidence in the flesh if any other man thinketh that he hath wherever he might trust in the flesh i'm more circumcised the eighth day of the stock of israel of the tribe of benjamin a hebrew of the hebrews as touching the law of pharisee which was the upper echelon it would be the he was what we would say a a fundamentalist a conservative he taught the law he believed the law he says but what things were gained to me amen those i counted loss for christ verse eight yeah he said dallas and i count all things but lost for the excellency of the knowledge of christ jesus my lord he said for whom i have suffered the loss of all things and to count them he says but dung they don't mean anything amen look at he uses graphic language to describe it it's nothing to me it doesn't mean anything to me i'm willing to put it all aside say i was completely wrong i lay it all down have you ever reached that place church i'm willing to whatever it was i'm willing to lay it down and turn around and say now in this moment on i have an absolute amen and so he says that i may win christ and i love these these next few verses it's just so touching he's writing this remember from a prison cell he says and be found in him not having mine own righteousness he said i'm willing to lay that all down all the things have been taught as a pharisee and be found in him not having minor own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the faith of christ the righteousness which is of god by faith that i may know him that i may know him that's the most important you can meet me and forget me and you'd be all right but if you ever meet him that's the thing that i may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death he said if by any means i might attain unto the resurrection of the dead mother so i had already attained look at the lack of arrogance in this man he said either we're already perfect but i follow after look at his humility he says if that i may apprehend that for which also i am apprehended of christ jesus so he said god got a hold of me and now i'm grabbing a hold of him amen amen so now he says brethren i count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing i do forgetting those things which are behind forgetting those things which are behind that's what i used to be that's who i used to be that's what i used to do i don't do that anymore i'm forgetting those things which are behind and i'm pressing on i'm pressing reaching forth unto the those things which are before it uses the imagery of a runner reaching for the finish line every ounce every stream everything he's got to press to the finish line he said i press toward the mark for the price of the high calling of god in christ jesus i press for the mark that's a christ-centered life that's what brother branham calls it in the absolute a christ-centered life and he has such a christ-centered life that he wanted others to be like him in fact he stood before king agrippa and acts 26 27 he said king a griffith believeth saw the prophets i know that thou believeth and agrippa said unto paul almost now persuades me to be a christian the man evidently didn't even have a seed of god in him but yet paul's testimony was so sincere and so he was so persuasive that he said almost now persuades me to be a christian well i hope we haven't been almost persuaded but we've been fully persuaded he said almost have persuaded me to be a christian and paul said i would to god that not only thou but also all that hear me this day we're both almost and all together such as i am except these bonds you know paul paul will let you know what's going on in his life he talks about how he was shipwrecked he talked about how he was beaten he talked about those things but there's such joy in paul's writing because he's constantly saying i'm not even worthy of those things i just counted a privilege to you know if we if we talk more like that we might persuade more people it's such a joy to be a christian yes i've given up a lot but i've got so much more it's not even worthy to be compared the suffering of this present time not even worthy to be compared to the glory that'll be revealed in me one day amen and so and so he he talks with such joy in this christ-centered life he said i wish you were like me except for these bonds here you drag him up and change the criminal before king griffin he says i would that we could swap places i i would that you could be like me you'd be better off than being a king be a christian amen what produces that kind of christ-centered life well brother branham said he had a christ-centered call and an absolute he said paul at one two he said the one we're reading about he had a christ-centered call and that was his absolute he personally met christ and i know i'm saying that over and over again but i want us to really ponder that and really get it down because we fought sometimes in the message over what the absolute is and what it means but you have to meet christ you meet christ you won't struggle with the message of the hour if you really meet christ you won't struggle with the things you you may have struggles in the flesh sure but there'll be something inside of you that that's the truth right there's something inside of you that reaches out for that you don't have to be taught into that it's something you have what brother madam calls representation right representation there's just something that's right you know it's right and brother brown says the reason he had this christ in her life is because he personally he said now laying aside his teaching and that's many times what we have to do but when we meet christ is lay aside our teaching because and that becomes a hindrance sometimes to message people growing up in message fuse because we've been taught what to do and how to do it but laying aside his teaching and those things are good i think we should teach our children everything we can but laying aside his teaching he personally met christ he personally met christ amen and it is the rising of the sun brother brown said i'm afraid today that too many of us are not getting people to christ we're getting them to a church to a theory but we must get them to christ he's the only one that can change their lives i can't do it how many times have i sit back here and stood here in the pulpit and wish i could change someone's mind wish i could change someone's life i cried because i wish i could make it different for somebody but i can't do it i can't do it i can't make you do something it's not a forced religion but if you ever meet him if you could ever meet him where you would get people to a church we get them to a theory you should come to church you should believe the message but we must get them to christ he is the only one and the only one that has life he that has the son has life and brother brennan preached that multiple times in the message he that has the son it doesn't say he that has an lld or phd or anything else he that has a son has life amen and when you have this christ-centered life and you just listen fast with me today i looked at that clock and i'm thinking we started at 10 but we didn't but we'll just go through it just as quickly as we can and close but when you have a christ-centered life there are some characteristics of that there are some things that you do automatically see a christ-centered life is a changed life a changed life first peter 2 10 i won't read it to save time but it tells us we're a peculiar people a holy priesthood brother says now when you become like paul have the same absolute that he had a christ-centered life is a different life than what you once had huh a different life than what you once had he said and it might be a very religious life that you lived and i didn't get the rest of the quote but brother branham goes on to explain how that a religious life and a christ-centered life is two different things you can have a very religious life that's not christ centered right but a christ-centered life is something that the person of jesus christ lives out of you automatically right it does it's not something you make yourself do but it lives out of you now so it's a different than a religious life brother brother says when you get this christ-centered life it makes you do things you ordinarily wouldn't do right like come to church like treat your wife right it's valentine's day treat your husband right did you realize and i've said it before you can't say i love god and i hate my wife right you can't say i have a christ-centered life and i hate my wife or i hate my husband but there's a reason why the scripture says husbands love your wives never has to tell the wise that that's true and and but but see you have a christ in our life you don't have to be told to love because he is love brother branham tells us that he is that great attribute of god called love when you get this christ in life it makes you do things you ordinarily wouldn't do so just think about yourself about your dna about the way you're made up about who you are and everything about you there's just certain things that you do right i find myself sometimes standing in a certain way or walking in a certain way i was at a funeral here not long ago someone who knew my father come up to me and said someone told me you were here and i knew who you were because you look like your dad and you know that's to me you know it's not really a compliment for someone to tell me that and not putting down my dad but it's just but i do look like my dad but you know he was old but i look like he did when he was 50. that's not good but the the thing is the characteristics i catch myself driving like he did and he never taught me how to drive but but i watched him and just just become a part of him and i'm that have that same nature in the flesh but a christ-centered life makes you do things that you ordinarily wouldn't do it's not just that you keep being yourself say well i'm just me and nothing changes just the way i am no a christ-centered life makes you actually go against the grain in your own nature right until you actually do things and your wife will look at you and say man that's not like you your family look at you that's not like you everybody else in the family does this side of the other but you don't why are you different why are you different every one of us probably has a testimony something like that why are you different from others in your family because christ became the center of your life and that's the anchor that holds you there's something there that grabs a hold of you and keeps you there amen it's a christ-centered life makes you do things you ordinarily wouldn't do so brother branham again says now if you if in your life you have an absolute you do things ordinarily you would not do he said especially if you have a god-centered life he says again it makes you do things when you get a christ-centered life like paul had ordinarily you wouldn't do he said now look ordinarily that man trained in all the scriptures and things ordinarily he would have followed that line he was trained in right ordinarily he would have been whatever he was but he come to the message of the hour why why did he why because he met christ right and he'd become actually the messenger of that hour but it was christ that he met now he said when he become and made christ his absolute his ultimate then there was a different life he did different he done things crazy to what he once was trained to do he said and it'll do the same thing and brother baby says if the church would get away from that council of churches and come back and make god's word their ultimate make god's word their typos that would do it but they're trying to make he said they're tying to a man-made achievement their absolute is man-made and because it's man-made it's movable right that's why one day the denomination can teach against there was a time all pentecostal denominations taught just like we do on holiness every one of them did the assemblies of god in the 1950s the 60s some of you probably old enough to remember when holiness people were holiness and now they've all drifted away but god didn't change the bible didn't change huh what changed their absolute was the church right they're absolute was the council of churches and because their absolute was the church the council of churches the group of ministers whatever that it was or some pope somewhere what they change with that absolute but i'm so grateful today that we don't have an absolute that's a church we don't have an absolute trust in the arm of flesh or absolute it's christ the word and so it can't change because he doesn't change but brother brown says that denominational system he said it's bound to fall he said well the bible said they would do it he said but there's going to be a bride that's been elected since the foundation of the world that's going to be tied to that post very bad what a promise that is that we know there's going to be a bribe and it gives us such assurance and such clarity in our understanding it gives us it gives us the zeal to keep on preaching to keep on keeping on why because we know there's going to be a bribe there's somebody out there somebody in arkansas somebody out there that's going to believe and you don't even know why you believe but you just believe why because there's a bride that's been elected since the foundation of the world that's going to be tied to the thai post amen and so we can go a little further we find that a christ-centered life is a creative life my brother branham talks about this he says i'm talking about an absolute connected with christ he said then it makes you an odd person you do odd things praise the lord your thinking is altogether different now you're not just different to be different because brother brown talks about that he said you're a hypocrite if you're just different to be different you're a hypocrite we don't do that but whatever the word says that makes us different and the truth is the gap between the worldly church and the true church gets wider and wider as we get to the end time and we know that there will be there will be that sum that like judas that stick on the very end but for the most part it gets wider and wider why because the the church has gone so far from god keeps going farther we're getting closer to him we're going in different directions huh if you're going to mammoth springs and i'm going to ash flat we're going to get farther and farther from each other that church is going down we're going up amen so brother said it makes you an odd person you do odd things your thinking is altogether different than thinking he once did because you have found something that you've anchored a faith in someone that created the heavens and the earth you've anchored a faith in someone that created the heavens and he said that his very word itself is creative a god who spoke the world into existence there is nothing too hard for him now watch he said so it makes you creative yourself why not not the flesh but it makes you creative yourself because you take his words right remember i said absolutely we could say like that is what he said so when you take the absolute what god says whatever he says wherever he says it whoever he says it through that's your absolute what god says what are you you're a thought of god amen you're what god says you become creative yourself because you take his words and a word he said is a thought expressed so it makes you creative creative now if you talk about a creative person you know some people are not creative i'm not creative my kids can take plato and make something that resembles an object out of it i have never been able to do that when i take play-doh it is flat sound that's all i can do with it some people can paint i if i painted it look like modern art right i just throw a paint brush at it be done with but some people can paint they're creative they just have that in them but all of god's children are creative in a supernatural realm are you hearing me this morning all of god's children are creative we let this flesh get in the way but there's something inside of you a seed a word of god that is creative that it creates its own atmosphere brother branham uses it simply like and you know this valentine's day talks about how that you can create an atmosphere in your home just by doing things you ordinarily wouldn't do you say what's a christ-centered life sometimes a christ-centered life is putting an apron on boy that hurts me because i've told some of you in counseling and things that i we have very defined roles i mean my wife because of necessity it's just i've always went to work she's always stayed home took care of the kids i didn't ever wake up with the kids and and i've always been amused by the men's cry room because i never got to take my kids out in church not saying i wouldn't it's wonderful that you brothers do but i never got to do that but you know we have very very designed roles but when you have a christ-centered life sometimes it takes you out of what you would ordinarily do right because of love for that person and so brother brandon talks about saving an atmosphere in his home by putting on an apron and helping his wife with the dishes and beginning to speak words that would quieten her you can do that a woman can do that the words you you speak have power they mean something you just just throw them out there they mean something i have to watch remember jesus said every idle word that you speak you'll give a count thereof on the day of judgment that's pretty with some of us that like to talk a lot we got a lot more to be accountable for amen brother david but see paul brother branham said had got into this state to where he had not had a theological experience altogether but he had a personal witness he had met god and knew that he was called of god and nobody had to tell him anything about it he was absolutely sure that god still remained god amen he said if the world could just do that amen and if this group tonight if we could say this group this morning if this group this morning those watching and streaming those here and present with us if this group tonight sitting here could just remember that god is still god amen he's god in a snowstorm he's god in the in the in the middle of cove but he's the god in the middle of everything that you're going through in your life no matter how muddled up it is no matter how dark it seems he's god he's still god amen and he's able to answer in this case he says he's just as able to answer in this case as he is in a case of divine healing or anything else he's still god amen so whatever you have need of this morning he's still god he's still able to answer hallelujah amen he said if we can build our hopes not only our hopes but a positive thought that's a powerful thing a positive thought is a powerful thing we can build not only our hopes but a positive thought upon what he says amen and we know that it's the truth hallelujah he said and people act funny amen they seem to just forget about the negative side because they've found an absolute amen they seem to just forget about the negative side because they found an absolute because it's the word of god jesus said heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never fail so if we've got the word of promise then there's no failing to it it cannot fail do we believe that today it cannot fail amen hallelujah it's a creative absolute a creative word a christ-centered life makes you a creative being what can that produce in you now brother branham in that absolute message he talks about wanted to be tarzan he said when he was little because he saw what tarzan could do i just pondered on that for a little bit i went back and listened to it again what could tarzan do so he said if i was tarzan i could swing through the jungle on a rope nothing could bother me nothing could catch up to me give me super strength i'd be tarzan i want to be like christ brother branham said i read those books i wanted to be like like uh the lone ranger i want to be like tarzan he said but one day i i read the real book he said i found i wanted to be like christ and we found that shakespeare if you had the life of shakespeare and your brother adam teaches us that in the message if you had the life of shakespeare in you you would do what shakespeare does you'd write plays right if you had the life of beethoven you'd write music if you had the life of john dillinger you'd rob banks and brother branham uses those illustrations over and over again and he says if the life of jesus christ lives in the person they become identified with him it's christ in you not a church member not a system but a resurrected power i've told you before we underestimate the value of the of the discernment that brother branham had and people say was just a gift no it was the sign of the son of man because what it was is he would see a vision and that would happen it hadn't happened since bible days in that manner because god was showing to the gentiles what he showed to the jews and samaritans brother branham brings that up over and over again what did it prove he said a wicked an adulterous generation seeks after a sign but they won't get one but the sign of the resurrection huh the sign of jonas amen it was it was in the belly of the well and come up it's the sign of the resurrection it proved amen that the resurrection that this was more than a church more than just a denominational system but the resurrected christ was among us right it proved that go back and listen to it they put they've colorized now deep cloths unto the deep it's on youtube you can go listen to it watch it and see what had happened what took place there it's important what took place it's at the end time god showed us he's still alive he said not a system but a resurrected power it's the holy ghost it's a token upon you that your life says amen to every scripture amen the promise is written in there he said and you are not yourself no more you are christ you don't think your thoughts he said you don't think your thoughts you say i think he said you have no thought coming that's hard on some of us thinkers isn't it he said you have no thought coming life that was in christ is in you the mind that was in christ is in you the works that was in christ is in you do we believe that today christ himself is in you he said you are dead your life is hidden god through christ sealed in there by the holy ghost you're not your own what does that life produce well in him and i won't hold you much longer but in him it produced a holy life a holy life in fact the bible says that even here and too were you called because christ has also suffered for us leaving us an example that you should follow his steps who did know sin neither was gal found in his mouth we believe in a life that a christ-centered life is one that can give you victory over temptation in mark 1-13 jesus was in the wilderness 40 days tempted of satan but he didn't sin once he said it was with the wild beasts and the angels ministered unto him but he did no sin hey man he said well i just can't help it of being overcome by temptation you can with a christ-centered life it doesn't mean that you'll be perfect because you're still in the flesh but you understand the man inside does not sin he can do no sin amen if you yield yourself to that he can keep you from every sin as you yield yourself to him now so he had victory over temptation a christ in her life there was virtue that's strength strength for somebody else you're not living for yourself anymore strength for somebody else brother brown said that was eternal life by the way was living for others a christ in her life gives you strength for someone else in in luke 6 19 it says the whole multitude sought to touch him there went virtue out of him and healed them all strength strength went out some of you provide provided strength to me and my family in different ways you can do that in in natural ways in spiritual ways you provide strength by something you say that's the nature of a christ-centered life is strength a christ-centered life doesn't drag people down right it provides strength to others excuse me a christ-centered life is not constantly concerned with what people think about or are not constantly concerned constantly dwelling on themselves or on some grudge that they've been holding but a christ-centered life provides strength to other people amen i want to be like that don't you don't you want that kind of a life well if you've met him that life is in you you just have to yield yourself to it amen that christ said her life was authority over nature in mark chapter 4 verse 39 he rose and rebuked the wind and said as the sea peace be still and the wind ceased there was a great calm don't you know that the same god that calmed the winds is able to calm the storms of our life he's able to conquer the earth it's one thing to speak a world into existence and go live on it it's another thing to speak in earth right here into the place where it ought to be that's the earth i want to speak to today with a christ-centered life you too can have that in your life there can be peace and it won't it won't be dependent on what everybody else says or does but peace a christ-centered life he wasn't dependent on how much faith the disciples had but he said peace be still and the waves ceased even though they doubted why he was god in flesh he was the absolute for that day but i'm going to get somewhere in a moment i want to show you something because this christ in her life can produce that same life in you look what does it produce forgiveness luke 23 34. jesus on the cross we could just dwell on that for a while father forgive them he didn't they didn't just speak bad about him on facebook they didn't just oh it's valentine's day but what love he had for us they didn't just run him down to their friends they didn't just talk about him yes they did all that they slandered him but they didn't just do that they nailed his hands and his feet across we did that the human race represented that it wasn't just the romans of the jews we did that nailed him to a cross and spit on him and put stripes on his back and and he stared dying in such pain he said father forgive them amen for they know not what they do even so callous that they gambled over his clothes to fulfill the scriptures don't you realize that if that same spirit lives in you you'll forgive the same way you have to jesus said if you stand praying when you stand praying forgive he said if you don't forgive other men of their trespasses you won't be forgiven that's a scary thought i don't want to not be forgiven so i'll forgive if i hold brother branham told multiple people he told the perry green and i i think he says something similar on tape but he said if you have one scratch of ought in your heart one scratch of art in your heart he said it'll keep you from heaven you can't go to that place that he's that he went to beyond the curtain of time if you have one scratch of all in your heart we've got to get to a place where we can say father forgive them they don't know what they did he did not attribute it to their to their malicious thinking though they probably had that he did not attribute it and say how awful they were he said father forgive them they don't know what they do amen then the jews laughed at his own people mocked him and spit on him and then 2 000 years later he's bringing the gospel back to him you know the gospel goes back to the jews after he leaves us it's going back to them with two prophets he's going to prove himself to 144 000 jews even though they were the ones who did that he's still going to give him such forgiveness amen i've always thought of that you know god's justice lasts for a long time but his forgiveness is forever and you look at his judgment and his justice how he kept the two tribes you know the story and brother brown talks about in the seventh field there's two tribes that are not represented there in that hundred forty four thousand but he said then over in the millennium or over in the in the new heavens and earth earth they're back again amen god being so gracious that he will not blot their name out forever aren't you so grateful for god like that provides mercy to generations that don't deserve it that's the way we should be what does this provide this gives me such great hope this christ-centered life is a life of resurrection the scripture says if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken make alive your mortal bodies such great symbolism of the joe when you lay someone in the grave and their their body their body is dead and you know it you've touched it you you know it's dead you've seen it it's dead it's not but you lay it away why because in hope of a resurrection and i know god can gather it from the four winds of the earth or whatever it is it may be a new body whatever i'm not going to get into the theology of that but you understand there's such great symbolism you lay it away and there's hope in your heart i know i'm going to see them again why because they're not in that body that's not the person but god's even going to raise up that mortal body it also quicken your mortal bodies by the spirit that dwells in you but he doesn't wait until the resurrection to quicken your mortal bodies he does that in the new birth it makes you alive gives you quickening power amen to live a christ-centered life amen listen to this brother said i can see eternity break come down into time since eden when it did there come a line of blood all the way up into calvary i promise i did away with most of my notes this morning but you just forgive me he said i see eternity break come down at a time when it did there come a line of blood all the way up into calvary and from calvary tied with this line goes on to the typos jesus and someday amen when he comes to claim his own everyone that's tied to that ultimate listen to that simple language that brother brown uses for the line of blood that goes down through history and here's a tie post and everything tied to it amen we'll be raised up into eternity amen someday says when he comes to claim his own everyone that's tied to that ultimate will be raised up into eternity why they had been in eternity all the time listen i got to reread that they have been in eternity all the time hallelujah you didn't get eternal life when you were saved that's the eternal means eternal never had a beginning never had an end god knew you before the foundation of the world he said they've been in eternity all the time they were predestinated in eternity you realize i was studying one time years ago and i found out the decisions made in eternity can't be changed there's no time to change them that's kind of a play on words but there's not you know the devil fell before time there's no time to change it think about that he is who he is the angels have failed they are who they are but time is given for redemptive purposes but we've been in eternity all the time hallelujah they were predestined an eternity they're part of god they were in his thinking at the beginning hallelujah that can't change oh sure there will be those whosoever will that will come and plead to the cross of christ but to the elected amen to the elected they were predestined from eternity and when that big rope is pulled of the line of blood he said that token i was speaking of when it comes up from the earth every one that was included in that blood will be dropped right up into eternity again hallelujah it somehow makes sense brother bram says it dropped right up into eternity i don't even know how that works but it makes sense amen but the only way it'll be will be tied to that absolute jesus christ he said it's absolute not an achievement of man well so-and-so did this my my mother my father my pastor some other great man they did this but it's not tied to an achievement of man but god raised him up from the dead and he is an absolute hallelujah hallelujah amen lost my place but we're about to close anyway he said we know he's alive amen because he's here with us in the power of his resurrection doing the same thing he did when he was here on earth he said i'm tied to that ultimate that's the end of all strife i'm tied to it that's my life i was a sinner when christ saved me i meant something and since that came into me it's been different and i'm tied to it everything that i am it's tied right there amen and then god's separating his life let me live in him and him and me then we're tied he said it don't make any difference what others want to believe to the individual you are tied to that and brother branham passed his bible he said that's your ultimate that's the last word and then if he is the word then this must be the last word this must settle it whatever that says he said that's that scarlet thread that is christ and anything contrary to that i know nothing about it he said that's what we want to know is what this word says i am tied to christ and christ is the word he said you get it now look so this is the ultimate and if you have to acknowledge the word is true whether you understand it or not whether you can make it tie in with everything you say well i can't get this quote to tie with the scripture but you acknowledge that the word is true and then you take it and filter it through that you have to acknowledge the bible that's true whether you can live it or not if you can acknowledge it's true you've got some place to start right because you can say lord help my unbelief right but if you can't acknowledge it it's true you've got nowhere to go you've got to acknowledge it he said that's what we want to know what this word says for i'm tied to christ in christ is the word amen he said on the portion of his word now watch this closely before we close i said it three times it's going to happen now the portion of his word that's lauded for this day his holy spirit is here to manifest that portion of word amen and he goes back to jesus he said just like it was back there at his birth isaiah 9 6 all down to the scriptures everything was spoken of him it was fulfilled over in the book of luke we see it that he said and he was the end he was the end of the prophecy too of him he fulfilled that the history the songs everything in the old testament that spoke of him it was fulfilled right there he said that become the ultimate that become the typos of the word of god for that age and the real listen to this born-again people of this age that's filled with the holy ghost is the thai post people argue about what the absolute is and they ask where's the welsh revival it's right here now remember i told you flesh can't be the absolute no flesh is the absolute right but the absolute dwells in you so you can say you're not the absolute but the absolute is in you you have the absolute and to the people of this age you are the absolute you're the typos of that scripture that makes it real are you with me now it could be interpreted in different ways but when it lives through david then it's real amen and that becomes an absolute the revealed word it's like the review booth it's the absolute amen he said in the real world again people this age is filled with the holy ghost is the typos of this scripture that's got to be fulfilled in these last days amen they are the ultimate church everything that god said is going to be wrapped up in us jesus said in the volume of the book it was written to me and we could say the same thing because there's parts of the book that were written about each age but in the volume of the book it's written about the end time bride you understand everything was written it's written about us and i don't say that to be cocky it's the truth it gives us a lot to live up to they are the ultimate it's god's ultimate because it's his word and the word is christ the typos there's no way to get away from it amen something that holds you see you can't you say well i'll get discouraged and leave the message not if you have not if you are the ultimate how can you it's not two different things you and the message is not different you and the end time word is not different you and the bride is not at two different things you don't live one life out here one life here one life in the world one life at church one life at home or life in the pulpit you don't do that why because you are the ultimate the life that you live is by the grace of god as paul said now your flesh may fail many times but there's something on the inside that becomes the typos to god's word for this day does that make sense it's god's ultimate because it's his word and the word is christ the typos there's no way to get away from it it's something that holds you amen amen something keeps holding me are you glad it does not just the preacher either some of you will get that in a minute they are the ultimate he says could we say that anymore plainly it's god's ultimate because it's his word and the word is christ it's something that holds you musicians go ahead and come there brother brown tells the story in the absolute sermon in december of 1962 about a man that went to war the man was got in the middle of a battle and the shells were flying he had a good friend that was a catholic and he wasn't religious this man but he had been around these catholics and the catholics said man said well what did you do he said well he said i reached down he said and i i saw some blood and he said and then i realized it was my blood it got real on the battlefield gets real sometimes on the battlefield of life it got real i realized that was my blood and the man said well did you do your rosary did you say a prayer to mary and the man said i didn't know what else to say he said he he said no he said when i realized that was my blood he said i didn't want to talk to a secretary i want to talk to the main man god help us today there's got to be an ultimate he said and that's it brother when a man comes to christ you don't want to take some preacher's word that's your blood that's your life there's got to be something real not just a preacher's word some secretary's word some something else he said you protestants don't take this side or the other go to that absolute until you're anchored there by the new birth being born again and filled with the holy ghost and you see the bible being manifested in humility and love through your life he said then that's your absolute amen do you believe that today we'll close heavenly father we love you today we thank you for christ's inner life it can be an absolute lord i pray that our thoughts have been turned toward this today no matter what takes place storms of life come and go just like natural storms no matter what takes place in our life you're still the absolute you're the same yesterday today and
