Philippians chapter 3 and verse 13 good to see all of our young people up here on the front this evening you all looking pretty good pretty good man they're a lot prettier on this side than you are on that side Philippians 3 and verse 13 I need yall to back me tonight a little bit where's trip at there he is Buddy you told me you'd sit on the front row and back me tonight and I'm going to hold you to it if I don't hear something out of you and you might get called out publicly and if I don't say anything worth backing then I guess that gets you off the hook Philippians chter 3 and: 13 do you love the Lord tonight did you did you enjoy the service this morning amen well go ahead I know Allan already asked you but I didn't hear whether you enjoyed it or not so I had to ask you again I I enjoy those things well tonight's not going to be near that good uh but if you'll pull real hard and real fast and uh we'll get you out of here and you know tonight and uh you know me I'm not long- winded or nothing we'll start my timer there to let me know how long I go over Philippians chapter 3 and: 13 Brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before I press somebody say I press I I press toward the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus and we'll read one more before you're seated 1 Corinthians excuse me 1 Corinthians chapter uh uh 7 and verse 35 and this I speak for your own prophit now he's dealing with marriage in this scripture but I just wanted to take this verse and focus on it here and this I speak for your own Prophet not that I may cast a snare upon you but for that which is comely and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction and you may have your seats this evening may the Lord add his Blessing to the word I I want to just lay a foundation with this quote here brother brandham talks about uh uh looking ahead and not looking back back and he says not looking back but we're looking forward to the breaking of a new day until there is something great laying ahead of us how many believes that tonight there's something great I believe there's a prize before us and we need to keep our focus in this hour above any other time I think now is the time we don't need to lose our Focus we don't need to get distracted by the things of the world but we need to keep our focus a and continue on with W with without distraction and and brother brand says looking for the breaking of a new day there is something great great laying ahead of us can you say Amen where the years has been the the the joy that we've been looking forward to the pressing coming of the great light and now we can see it breaking Over the Horizon he said it it's breaking between Mortal and immortality and we see it breaking between the heavens and the Earth from an Earthbound sickness and troubled world into a bright shining day of an immortal life and an immortal body and an immortal Earth that shall never pass away that sounds like a good place to to be he says it it's shalom to the church now it's light time for the Believers can you say Amen but a gross Darkness for the unbelievers it's for the church for the people but now it's a time of light for us it's a time it's a time of of immortality that's coming into you listen if you're not distracted you can see where we're headed you can see the prize that lays ahead of us if you're not if you're not caught by distractions of the world now now there must be a desire to win there must be a desire to actually reach your gold there must there must be a desire in you young people's hearts to actually reach for the prize that is ahead of us can you say Amen there's got to be a desire there you're never going to reach it if you're distracted and always just looking to this way and looking that way no there's got to be a desire to keep on pressing the battle can you say amen I press towards the Mark I press towards the prize I press why because it is a battle it is a time that you got to fight it is a time that you got to keep pressing but you cannot get distracted by what the devil's going to try to bring you down with he doesn't want you to get to your prize he doesn't want you to make your to make your goal he doesn't want you to make it all the way because he knows if he can get you distracted in the age of distractions in a time of distraction he knows he can keep you Earthbound but I I I think there's a young people here there's a group of people here today that are not going to be Earthbound creatures but we are eagles and we are we are to be caught up into a realm that is going to break from mortal into immortality well I wish somebody would say Amen tonight somebody's going to make it somebody's going to reach the prize somebody's got to hold the trophy at the end of the year think about a football season think about a football season it's a long season and if you got a bad team it's an even worse season but if you got if you got a team some of you kids know about football right you got a long season and you start off and you got to win so many games or may you may not even make the playoffs if you get distracted by the money or you get distracted by another team well they're too good to beat let me tell you something it's all up here you you you've got to keep fighting no matter how good the I tell you what your opponent is the devil and he looks strong but he cannot overtake you because you've got the greatest coach in the history of coaches you've got the greatest quarterback in the history of quarterbacks and it's not Tom Brady come think about it if God is on your side you are going to hold the trophy at the end of the season so when the Super Bowl comes around and you're the underdog you can't lose because it's already been rigged in your favor God has already given you the ability to win he's already given you everything you need you've seen the Playbook and you already know every play and so when the devil puts you back from first and 10 to Second and 15 well if you ladies don't have a clue what I'm talking about out and he gives you a setback and you feel defeated before you even play another down well what it is it's the devil on defense and he's trying to stop you from winning the game but all you need is just one good pass all you need is just one good down and then you make another down all you need is a first down and another first down and the next thing you know you're you're holding the football in the end zone what is it you've you've defeated your enemy and you've made it to your goal and now you've got a chance to win the game now that's the way this I know this is simple but I'm trying to put it where the kids can understand it you've got a goal then you want to hold that trophy at the end of the game now you've got to fight with all you've got for 60 minutes or better you've got to fight with everything that's in you if you're just distracted by how good that other team looks or if you're distracted by the scoreboard you may never win but you've got to quit looking at your distractions and start looking at the goal hold that Trophy up before you and say that's my goal and I'm not going to leave here defeated but I'm going to well come on somebody I'm not leaving this place defeated but I'm going to keep pressing on until I can hold that trophy in my hand we we've let the devil tell us we can't win we've let the devil tell us that we're not good enough we're not big enough we're not strong enough well you may not be in your own self but with God on your side oh all things are possible to them that believe all things are possible to them that are I tell you what you're an overcomer you young people were put in Leia because God knew you could handle it that's right God knew you could win in a time where so many would fall away and sit down and didn't want to win now there's got to be a desire now in Psalms 27:4 David said one thing have I desired of the Lord and that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple now you've got to have a desire for the things of the Lord you've got to have a desire to seek after the things of the Lord you've got to have a desire to behold the beauty of the Lord you've got to have a desire to inquire in his Temple well can you say Amen you've got to have a desire in order to make these things happen if you have no desire to come to church then it won't do you no good to be in church if you don't have a desire for the things of the Lord then the things of the Lord will have no hold on you but if you have a desire for the things of God then nothing can keep you from getting your full potential in the house of God now if you want healing don't be distracted by the sickness come on yeah well can you say Amen if you want healing you can't be looking at the symptoms that's a distraction I I if you want some I'll tell you what you've got to follow the orders of faith in total Faith you got to follow the orders of the word in total Faith you've got to you've got to surrender your own thinking you got to surrender the distractions to be able to overcome the distractions that are trying to stop you well can somebody say Amen now now there's going to be all kinds of distractions let me go ahead and tell you there's distractions from the message of the hour by by by false prophets there's there's there's false Messengers well come on somebody there's going to be false teachers on the internet some of you are going to see you're going to see them at some point in life listen you you can't hide them forever we can we can shelter our children but there's going to be Devils come in their minds and say well what about this and what about that well listen there's going to be Devils come against you to distract you from your goal now in this age there is an ultimate goal for the Believers and I hope this is okay for you young people but there's an ultimate goal that you have now your ultimate goal maybe you you at your age you may say well my goal is to grow up and get married and have a job and and all these things that's that's fine that's a good goal for this life but that is not your ultimate goal your ultimate goal is to make a Rapture can you say Amen your ultimate goal is to have a body change your ultimate goal is to get out of this world and go to a world that we have already waiting for us and a body that is already prepared for us can you say Amen young people that's what you're looking for your your job is temporary your spouse it's until death do we part but it's temporary because there is death can you say Amen death can separate you from your spouse death can separate you from your friends death can separate you from your job you can lose your job you can lose your friends but you cannot lose the promise of a body change if you've accepted this message of the hour and have received the baptism of the Holy Ghost well I think that's something we need to start looking for I think our young people need to be on fire because it's not just about this flesh and body it's not just about this this world that we live in it's I tell you what I want to see him success successful I want to see every young person in here successful and and have money and new cars that's wonderful but that's not going to be the measure of success when you get there the measure of success is going to be did you yield yourself to the Holy Ghost did you give yourself to the Lord did you give everything you've got did well come on somebody I'm going to tell you something we've got too many people focused on this world that will pass away and not enough people focused on a land that is eternal it is a land that is Flowing with milk and honey it is a land that is Flowing with all the good things of God listen you can have the blessings here but you'll have trouble in this world you'll have trouble in this life but he has come to give you the comforter so that you can overcome this world and so that you can live and that you can have an eternal well come on somebody you young people I I think you need to know where you're going this is not the end of your life right here when you get to be 70 80 90 years old that doesn't end what you are no you are an eternal being did you know that you can't die you can't pass away you are an eternal being we well come on somebody you know what that means that means that you are forever and ever and ever and you cannot pass away when this world is gone when your job's gone when your friends are gone you still have a body that you're going to be living in why because you are passing from a mortal being into an immortal being well come on somebody you are a Christian and you are a believer of the message of the hour now this world is going down and we can see it we can see this world in Gross Darkness we can see it in chaos and every well come on now we can see it all around us there's Insanity everywhere but there's a group of people who are getting ready to leave this world you are getting ready to get out of here why because God has given you the ability to mount up on wings like eagles he has given you the ability to I'll stay here in a world that is going down and going through a tribulation we're not going to be here when them bombs start falling did you know that come on you young people you know this world's going to be blown to Pieces but you are not going to be here for it right come on some of you parents ought to be saying Amen to that some of you Parents Ought to say you know what I'm not letting my children stay here I'm going to hold that to over them just well come on somebody I'm going to hold that token over my children I'm not leaving them in this chaos that we're living in now this is a this world order they call it that is total chaos and Insanity what it is it is a place that we are we are being trained we are we are our faith is being tested we are being tried and and distractions will come to see can you keep your focus on the goal what can the church say Amen if you keep your focus there is something for for you to attain but you cannot attain it by Falling to the side and following after distractions now in the Bible there is a uh there's a woman she's called the shunamite woman are you kids still awake I don't have any more football stories we might work on something else there's a shunamite woman and this woman had needed she wanted a son she wanted a child and so a prophet prayed for her and she had a son how many knows the story just a little bit okay well that's okay at least you're at least you're honest you know I like it I don't know that story my dad and mom don't teach me those things so so then then this little boy gets sick and he dies now this is a promised son that dies this is a this is a child that has been born and then he dies now now that that might that would shake some people's brother brandom actually talks about the father of this son pacing the floors and hollering and screaming and sad because the son had died he was gone but he said this woman never lost faith matter of fact when she oh come on somebody this woman never loses Faith she's not distracted by death she's not distracted she's not distracted by the things that are going wrong in her life but what well come on now if you're needing a child don't be distracted cuz it ain't here right when you need right when you want it don't be distracted there is a promise and that is is the goal hold to the promise I don't care what the distractions are the doctor May say you can't have them the doctor May say you can never have a child but God said you could have a child so hold on to that promise don't let the distractions of the doctor's opinions get in your way so Brother Talks he said uh the woman said go ask go ask if I shall speak to the chief captain and he goes on he said I'm going to try to skip this cuz time is going way faster than I expected he said I wonder if I could speak when I go before him when I'm called one of these people so G ha went and asked her and she said no she said I abide with my own people I don't have any reasons to ask things like that that was just out of my heart just because I know he's a man of God she wanted to go talk to the prophet and I want to show favor to him and that's all and and she come back and but her husband is old and they have no children now this is the promised son and Elijah must have saw a vision he said go tell her about the time of Life about a year from now she'll Embrace a child and she did and she had a little boy and this little boy brother bandham talks about him was about 12 years old and he was out in the field with his father and brother brandham says it may have been a sun stroke or a heat stroke because this little boy actually he he's he's out there in the field working he's actually working imagine you happed to work in a field but he's working and this this boy's Out In the Heat of the day and and it's hot he don't get to go inside in the AC because they probably didn't have air condition in the house it's true yeah they probably didn't have air conditioner in the house they couldn't go in and say I want I I want a popsicle and I want I want a glass of cold water no no these the this little boy had to work had to work that's foreign word to some of you isn't it it it to my kids anyway it's it had to work you know what the word work is you know what it means anybody know the definition of work nobody oh you do go tell me you're a banker son you don't know I'm sorry think about it though this little boy's working and he dies now we'd feel bad if we put our kids in a position where they died right we would as a parent you'd feel bad if you put your kid out there working hard and and and and they die Lord help me to get back on track and brother brandom said no breath in him he had died she took him and laid him upon Elijah's bed yeah now that's this woman had Faith you talk about a woman of Faith did this woman had Faith now and then she said to the servant saddle a mule and go forward and don't stop till I tell you because we want to go to the man of God this woman was not going to be distracted by death this woman was not going to be distracted by the fact that she was in a bad situation God had already give her the son come on somebody the promise had already been fulfilled she knew that if he could give her a son he could bring that son back to life life now this body gets cold this body gets stiff this and she goes and she doesn't stop and she said and and she goes there and God don't tell His prophets everything brother B says the prophet didn't even know why she was coming this was the woman's Faith this wasn't a prophet saying oh I already knew you was coming and I knew that boy was dead no no no the prophet didn't even know she was coming the the prophet didn't and and and said and and God has kept it from me I don't know what she wants and when she come and brother said I like this when she got up close to Elijah Elijah screamed out and said all is well with thee and she says and he says all is well with thy husband and notice the husband Walking the Floor screaming he didn't have the faith that she had and him just screaming and going on all the neighbors going on and the baby hours before that was laying cold on the bed but when she got to this man of God she said all is well oh thank you Lord all is well all is well I know I'm facing Devils I know I'm in an age out of of leay out OFA but all is well because I've got my eyes on the prize and I'm not going to give up until I reach that prize I'm not going to be distracted I'm not going to be stopping to the left or looking to this neighbor that tells me God can't raise that boy from the dead God can't give the Holy Ghost no more well come on somebody you're going to have friends whether it be in school you're going to have friends that may I I hope they're not in church but you're going to have friends that say well you can't be you can't be a believer because you've made mistakes and well come come on some of you older young people know what I'm talking about you made mistakes you messed up well come on somebody God has come down to give you the ability to put those things in the sea of forgetfulness now now God has done it for you but you don't have to hold on to that baggage no longer you don't have to hold on to those things that are holding you down you young people you're going to make mistakes yeah you think you're perfect now just wait come on but don't let the devil tell you you've went too far when you made a mistake that's just a distraction that's just something to try to get you off track that's just something to try to tell you you're not good enough that's the devil don't you listen to the devil because he is the distractor he is the one that's sitting over on the side of the road you're not going to make it you you can't go any farther buddy you're not going to make it all the way to the end why because I I've laid every trap for you you can't make it but then there's a little there's a little something on the inside of you that says that devil said I couldn't make it but I see the prize I see the goal and I'm going to hold it in my hand I'm going to well come on now I'm going to keep on keeping on I'm going to press until I reach the ultimate goal we don't have to give up we don't have to listen to the devil who is the devil anyway he's already been cast down he's already had his keys taken away from him he's already been stripped of his powers the devil has no power over you sir none of you the devil doesn't own you the devil doesn't get to tell you how you are and where you're going if the devil tells you where you're going why don't you just go back and say devil you don't even have power anymore you don't even have keys to death and Hell anymore you don't even well come on somebody you don't have any right to the Sons and Daughters of God because the keys have already been stripped powers of that's just a distractor to try to get you off the path that leads to the great well come on somebody that leads to the ultimate goal you know the the goal you know it's going to come in such a way that there's going to be many church people that don't believe it'll ever happen there's going to be all kinds of of leosia church members that'll say well the Rapture is not really going to happen I've heard them say this I I heard a man one time I believe he was I don't I don't know I want to say he was Methodist or something like that he sure acted that way when he was prying to Pulpit anyway but but he was Methodist or something and he said he didn't actually believe in a literal Rapture of the church and I'm sitting there thinking what is a body change change what what what what do we have hope in then if you have hope only in this life you're a miserable human being but I don't have hope in this flesh I don't have hope just in this church building get me out of here but I have hope that God is going to change this body well I tell you when you start looking like me and brother Ben you hold on to that hope a whole lot more because you want a body change you want to get out of here you don't want to look like this forever the Lord tells me you're going to enter that land with that body I said Lord please please give me a new one I I don't want to look like this forever some of y'all are saying well I'm good-looking well that'll change it'll change let's wait you know brother Ben used to look like you your daddy used to have a head full of hair too look at him now yeah yeah life can come at you fast you can have good hair one year and bold the next it's the way it is you want a body change and you know when you get older you have aches and pains and you don't even know what causes them yeah you know things just happen brother Joe probably knows what I'm talking about you know you just have he's in his 50s now and and you know you you just start aching I don't even know about that yet actually but I'm just telling you what I've heard I'm still young like y'all but some of these people I mean you start seeing them they you know they come up to play music and they they can't hardly get up there and they and they they're hurting you know they get old their grandmas are in Grandpa now you know you you've seen I'm talking about brother Joe now you know you you've seen them do that Lord but you know what I'm talking about your body's going to fail you yeah this body will fail you your your your your daddy and mommy could fail you that doesn't mean you don't respect them but they could they could they could absolutely fail you they they they could let you down they could make decisions that that that could absolutely hurt your life not on purpose but just because they're human beings they could make mistakes they are humans you got to love them and you got to respect them but but they could make a mistake with you I I well come on somebody my parents are sitting on me come on has any parent in here ever made a mistake kids don't look at them you're not a parent but you've made mistakes why because you are in a body of Flesh there's got to come A change that will get you from this body from a mortal flesh to an immortal body well come on somebody and you young people you may not think about it now you may just think about the the next 10 years or the next 15 years but there's got to come something on the inside of you that says I'm not I I'm not satisfied with this world I'm not satisfied with the things of the world but I'm looking for a promise to come and I will not be distracted by what the devil throws at me because that's the thing I and this is just on my heart it's simple but I want to tell you I think the thing that's hurting our young people today is distractions I believe our young people well I'm I'm I'm G just leave my few notes that I do have we got we got young people and you go to camp and you get in a you get in a an environment to where to where where you're all in one Accord and there's very few distractions some camps cell phones don't work some camps you can't have cell phon phon some camps you go and and you know it seems like there's just such an atmosphere that you lose the distractions of the world any of you young people say amen to that anybody ever been to camp no all right but you've been there right and you kind of lose focus of what the world is and you start focusing on the things of God and you realize the feeling that you have is actually a it's a joyful feeling you kind of lose the cares of the world you kind of lose focus on what Monday morning is going to bring now you have to face Monday morning but you don't have to lose focus that you found in Youth Camp on now I'm just going to deal with this it's okay you can't lose your focus that experience you had was real but you've got to fight the devil on Monday morning well that experience you felt was absolutely from God but you've got to fight the devil that's going to try to distract you he can use your friends to distract you he can use well come on somebody he can use a service maybe you you you think well I'm going to go there and I'm going to shout I'm going to well well he can distract you by something going on in the church there could be a kid that acts up right in front of you and it completely causes you to lose focus on the service the devil does that not the kid the kid's not the devil usually but but it but it's the devil but it's the devil that does that I'm I'm trying to keep them awake is that okay but listen you lose focus just like some of y'all are doing every time like I'm doing right now you lose F lose focus on what you're trying to say and then the listeners are losing focus on what I'm trying to say and what we're trying to say is don't lose your focus don't lose see see the Devil is a distraction and so when you get back from Youth Camp you get back from Youth Camp and and and everything you think is going to go with right brother trip you know they come from Youth Camp and my cups running over and and they get back home and they realize oh I still have to live in this world I I was in Heavenly places I was you know the I was able to shout and nobody judged me I was able to you know what come on now you had Fai your faith got so high you could claim whatever you wanted and it just seemed like it was there now now now the same God is here this evening yeah that's right that's what you don't understand the same God is sitting right next to you the same God is dwelling among you but if you lose your focus you won't recognize him there because things have gotten your focus and your attention and and God is sitting there knocking on your heart hey I'm still here and I still want you to focus on me but but but but but you got to quit looking at the world quit looking at your problems quit looking at your friends and what they're doing and focus on on the promise that God will pour out his Spirit again God will move upon young people God will fill you with the Holy Ghost well I'm just going to tell you tonight don't lose your focus don't lose your ability to connect with the presence of God just because the devil has tried to put one over on you and try to steal your joy I would say we ought to stand with one Accord and say restore unto me the joy of my salvation restore unto me the joy of Youth Camp right restore unto me what I had felt why because he's not a million miles away he's not a God that's far off he's an everpresent God and he's here to send down His blessings even here tonight well can you say amen I want I want to tell you about Napoleon any of you know about Napoleon I don't even want to ask that question do any of you go to school I'm going to give a prophet's version check it with the history books and he might have had lived I'm not sure cuz I don't know anything about it I didn't go to school we think of a conqueror Napoleon at the age of 33 he conquered the world he whipped Every Nation there was to be whipped he was so discouraged because there was nobody else to fight and he sat down and cried he wanted to fight and everybody was gone he' already defeated everybody and and he got got bored kind of like some of you look right now he got bored he got bored because there was nobody to fight imagine if you didn't have a brother to pick on to fight with I'm not talking to you girls I'm talking to these boys but imagine you get bored you're like I'm just sitting here Peter knows how it is he never got to beat up on nobody in his whole life I mean really you know and and and he was told no you can't hit the girls you can't do that well now you can't hit nobody you know cuz he who do I punch who do I hit I can't hit nobody I I'm bored I can't fight but he played the rules of the game unfair tens of thousands I shouldn't even read I'm going to skip this part because it does not go well with what I just said at the age of 33 conquered the world but he was once prohibit prohib prohibition prohibit and you can PR pronounce that word yourself cuz I can't right now and he died an extreme alcoholic think about it this is a guy who conquered the world and he dies an alcoholic because he got bored he couldn't fight no more I've got a point here I think just just just let me get to it okay he said he forgot the message oh what did he what did he forget the message he had he had conquered the world but forgot the message like the little boy that run the race like like the church that is running today like the people that's running like the nation is running our refuge is not an atomic bombs our refuge is Jesus Christ and his resurrection Napoleon had forgot the main thing he had forgot and what happened to him he said he died totally defeated why he didn't play the game right though he had conquered the world physically he had prepared an army that was with with a military genius he took every nation and done the things that no other man could have ever done or ever did do but he forgot what the real message was was he had taken it and got his military strength but he forgot the strength of the Lord he he completely got distracted by this by by by the by the by the Army you you could get distracted by your job and have the most successful career out of anybody in the town of Hardy which is not very which is not much but you could have you could really be successful but if you miss the message you miss the main thing and it's nothing but a distraction to you your your worldly success is nothing if you miss the message your your well come on somebody I you know if I can't get much out of these kids tonight so I'm going to need some adults to back me here if you miss the message of the hour you have missed the main thing because the message has come to call you out of this world and make and help you reach the mark that you are pressing for but you will not make it on your own you cannot make it through through well you say well through your own goals you say well I've got a fitness goal I do too brother Ben's got a fitness goal we've all got fitness goals we want to see if we can fit in our suits next week and and we want to really fit you know we we want to get fit but listen that goal won't do you no good that goal will only keep you Earthbound that goal is only temporary but the goal that we are for we are going to is not just a temporary goal but it is an eternal being that we are trying to become we are getting out of this pest house anybody know what that is no you don't know what a pest house help me Lord I don't either it's what you're living in you know look at yourself in the mirror tomorrow and say that's a pest house you girls are like no I don't I don't think that of myself this is temporary did you know that you could live be 100 years old and you're still temporary yeah right you're temporary things that that's why we don't live for this this is just a distraction this this this this world is full of distraction do you realize everywhere you turn when you when you when you drive down a Scenic Highway you know why it's a Scenic Highway because you have to look at the distractions you're not supposed to look at the distraction you're supposed to look at the road it's a Scenic Highway why would you ever drive a scenic route if you're by yourself in the car come on somebody you could literally get a ticket for distracted driving just for driving on a scenic route every one of you could not you none of you drive think about it it's a distraction and it some people would call an attraction but it's actually a distraction if you drive out to you ever go to Tucson sometime you ever go out there you get to this place what's it called it's it's called a uh what is it it's it's a it's a what's that called it's a it's a museum it's a museum with a mummy in it oh and uh and it's it it has no the thing the thing it's it's that's that's not an attraction by the way that's a distraction if there ever was one there's nothing there it has no purpose it's it but it wants you to stop and and cost yourself 30 minutes from getting to Tucson to go through and find out there's a mummy in there maybe I I don't even know if I've ever seen it but I've went through there and it's a distraction the devil has got all kinds of little road shows set up just to try to stop you when you sit down to read your Bible young people listen to me for a minute when you sit down to read your Bible the devil's always saying well there's a movie on you could go watch or there's a TV show that you could watch instead and it's much more entertaining you're exactly right it is an attraction to the young it is an attraction to our age it is an attraction to our young people but it is a distraction from the things of God it is not it is not going to help you it is not going to do nothing for you it's going to get you it it might teach you some things you could you could sit down and listen I'm not against learning obviously I needed some of it but listen what what you've got to do is remember there is the main thing and the main thing is not what you learn here and not what you know here history's great and history's good and you can use it for all things in life and and math is good and and I was trying to teach Peter the other day how to read a tape measure and it was it would be good for him to learn how to read to take measure because if he's going to work with me he's got to learn how to read to take measure amen there's some things you have to learn here but it has nothing to do with your Eternal being you're you you you may become a doctor here and that is a successful thing to become but it will never affect whether you make it or not that's right you could you you you you could be a nobody or you could be a somebody and when you get there you're going to be the same the somebody and the nobody are still going to have to go through the same portal that anybody else is going to have to go through you say well I've made a million dollars and what have you made well I'll tell you I I wish I made the million dollars too but it's not going to help my soul any when we what I'm telling you is I'm not trying to tell you not to be successful you need to be successful you young people I you you need to have goals you need to focus and all these things those are wonderful things but I'm not here to tell you about finances tonight what I'm here you to tell I would be the wrong person to ask anyway but I would like to tell you tonight that what you need to focus on is getting back in the Bible again young people you young people that went to Camp get back on fire for God and don't let the devil distract you with things of the world I wonder if some of you Elder people if I could talk to you for a minute I wonder if you could go back to like it was when you first came to the message you could say well I I used to have joy I I used to feel really good in church I used to be able to worship like nobody well let me tell you something what happened it God didn't change the word didn't change come on somebody but what you need to do is go back to where you left that love and and quit being distracted well some people say well we used to have it so good that you know the past can be a distraction that's right you know a good preacher can be a distraction that's why I've chose not to be one I don't want to distract you you know from the main thing don't want to be good-looking and good preacher like brother Ben because then you'd be distracted I completely lost my spot I want to say this you'll defend your rights as an American you'll defend your rights to a good career but you lose focus on going back to church and really getting in touch with God again there's a story I heard and I'll mess it up because I'm not a good story Storyteller either I'm not really good at anything actually but here I am so there's a story I heard by another preacher and uh he he said it and he and he said there was a successful man and there was this man that asked him how do you be successful how how can you be successful he said well he said uh if you want to be successful meet me in the morning out here at the beach and I'll tell you how to be successful and so he got out to the beach the next morning and and uh the successful man's standing out there and he says now come in ankle deep and so the man does and he says what's this got to do what how's this going to make me successful I didn't come to to swim I come to be successful so he says well come out a little farther you want to be successful come out a little farther I said well I out to waste next thing you know he's got water up to his neck and the successful man reaches over and puts him under the water and holds him down till he starts bubbling gets water in his lungs and he LS the man up and the man comes up and the the successful man ask him what were you thinking of he said just trying to get a breath he said when you want to be successful as bad as you wanted that next breath then you'll be successful now if you want what God has for you as bad as you want your next breath then then I tell you what nothing can stop you the devil can't stop you from getting all that God's got for you but you've got to want it you've got to have a desire one thing have I desired of the Lord and that will I seek after that thing will I seek after that I may inquire of the Lord that I may be in his Temple well come on somebody I want to dwell in the house of the Lord I don't want to stay here in this pest house I don't want to stay here in this Earthbound vessel but I want to move on to the ultimate goal in a Rapture that God has for you you know you young people I believe you're the generation that's going to not I don't believe you're going to taste death I believe you're going to see God coming in the Clouds Of Glory I believe he's going to come after you and there's going to be a change come over you and you're going to start seeing loved ones uh you may be now you may be when you're teenagers but think about it when you get a little older some of you younger younger people listen don't be scared of a Rapture that is what your goal is don't be scared of a body change that's your goal don't be scared of of going to the afterlife that is what we're here for we're not here to build kingdoms here on this Earth we're not here to say well well this is all I've got this is no I don't want to be a miserable person in this life only but I have a hope that there is another land and you're going to go to it I tell you what we're not going to leave one behind are we come on don't leave me hanging yall are awful come on you're all going we're not going to leave you here why because we are determined to hold the token over our children parents can say Amen to that you're determined to hold the token over these children I I tell you what they may they may try they may try to depart from it but they cannot depart from the love of God that's in their life they cannot depart from the seed that has been planted on the inside because when God strikes that seed they can't help but come forth as Sons and Daughters of God they can't help but fall in love with god well I hope somebody's hear me tonight you say well that's too simple if I could leave you with one thing I'd say don't look at the distraction but look at the prize at the end of The Journey because it will be worth it all it will be worth everything when we actually see him face to face he who we loved he who we love well come on somebody I love is appearing I want to see him brother excuse me 1 Timothy 69 uh 612 says it like this fight the good fight of Faith lay hold on eternal life where unto Thou Art also called and H has professed a good profession before many witnesses we didn't do this in a closet we don't do this setting at home but before many witnesses we're going to fight this fight before many witnesses we're going to lay hold on the faith of God and say you know what if it's an altar experience I need then I'll go to the altar right you know sometimes if you wanted to go to an altar as bad as you wanted a movie we couldn't keep you back did you know that you probably need an altar more than you need a movie right but I'd hate to ask you how many times you watch a movie every day come on but think about it if you'll ever listen there's a voice on the inside of you not the one I've got that talks to you I talk to myself not that kind but there's a voice there's a voice on the inside of every you that's every one of you that's calling you that's calling you to do something but you have got to yield to that voice and when you're distracted you can't hear the voice of God well come on somebody the world has tried to drown out the voice of God with distractions the world has tried to get your attention now I'm not saying anything against Sports because I use Sports as an illustration but what what I'm saying is that's just a distraction in the grand scheme of things that's just a distraction because you think about every time you pulled up the ESPN app to check what your team standing was in baseball if you if you read if you just replace that with a couple Bible chapters right well it got quiet you kids don't know what ESPN app is well I tell you it's a thing you get addicted to when you're about 45 years old middle-aged people that have nothing to do and they're not retired but they get home and you kids are all grown up and out of the house and they're sitting there and their wife's cooking and they're sitting there what do I do I don't know what to do so they pull up ESPN and all my team's horrible they're at the bottom of the division the Cardinals I'm talking about they're just awful and and they're just just horrible and the Cubs are bad too brother Joe and they're just so bad and uh they're really bad actually but they uh but the Brewers at the top of the standing you look at all these things and you realize if I would have just read a scripture instead of finding out how bad my team was I would have actually benefited myself instead of depressing myself it's a distraction now I'm about ready to close but I want to tell you this there these are all things some good things can distract you I'm going to say this and I'm going to close I've got a minute and 12 seconds left relationships can be a distraction sorry sorry buddy relationships can be a distraction I'll say it one more time relationships can be a distraction if you just got on fire for God and then and your next goal is well I just need a boyfriend girlfriend no that that's not exactly what you need to be looking for what you need to focus on is I need to make sure that I've really got the Holy Ghost before you ever start dating somebody you need to make sure you got the Holy Ghost can you say Amen friends can be a distraction that's why it's important who you hang out with right that's right good friends are are good good friends can be can be a good thing good friends can help you bad friends are such a distraction because what it is they may be good people but if they don't hold your values they are a distraction to you can you say Amen drama in your life drama is a distraction some people say well I'm just a dramatic person well you you might be but that's sometimes just a distraction brother R says like this and and I'm I'm I'm closing with this quote every one of you people who profess to be Christians get yourself quiet before him don't let the washing hinder don't let the work hinder don't let nothing hinder now when he says nothing that gives us the ability to put whatever we want that would hinder us and distract Us in there don't let nothing distract you that's right from getting alone with God I know I've just been all over the place today but I wanted you young people can you just pay attention for like two more minutes I've got 30 seconds left but two minutes okay don't let nobody know what you're doing just go somewhere get outside or go into the secret closet you young people can do this did you know that hello did you know that did you know that you can pray at your age and get alone with God going to the secret CL it when the kids gets at school now this is for you adults here because I wonder if sometimes I'm guilty of this by the way I wonder if sometimes our kids don't see us praying enough and they don't really know what prayer life is on it got kind of somber there for a minute but that's because a lot of us I think are in the same boat our kids don't ever see what it's like to really oh my dad's got a real prayer life because I've seen him go get quiet I've heard him pray before the Lord I I I've I've seen it well come on somebody say well I'm guilty well you can say Amen or ohe me it doesn't matter but but one one thing for sure is we're all guilty of not praying enough I can stand up here and talk too much but we can never pray too much that's right he said go to the secret closet get on on your knees you've heard all kinds of voices everywhere but just get down and stay there until those voices are silenced and you begin to lift up it'll change you it'll make you different like it did Samuel it'll do something to you if you'll just do it now it'll make you what you should be it'll make you the kind of Christian that you ought to be can you young people say amen to that you want to be a good Christian you want to be an overcomer and not distracted you've got to pray as the musicians would come I I just want to hit these real quick false teachers can be a distraction you can hear something on the Internet that's just a distraction to get you from the real thing there could be gifts that could be wrong and they could be a distraction to try to get you out of church friends are a distraction the past some of you Elders listen to me the past is just a distraction sometimes oh there's wonderful things in the past and maybe you need to go back to where you left maybe you need to go back to where you left something and repent and come back but but don't stay in the past because it's just a distraction if you look in the rearview mirror long enough it just becomes a distraction how many of you's ever been distracted from an Altra call anybody just me I've wanted to be at an altar how old how old are you Jared 11 I was about 9ine or 10 and I remember I went to an altar and I got distracted because they closed the service on me just like that they closed it they they just they went to a fast song and then I completely lost I I the desire to be at the altar left me now I say that because it's up to us musicians and song leaders we want to create an atmosphere where you feel like you should be there but don't don't get distracted if you need to be at the altar don't get distracted by something that makes you get up it took me a whole year year and a half more before I ever felt to go back to an altar again you say what good is an altar do I'm going to tell you there's a lot of us that started an altar well can can anybody here say Amen to that some there's been a bunch of you here tonight that started at an altar and then you want to get rid of altars in the church come on I say our kids need to be welcome to the altars again make altars great again bring altars back in the church let let young people feel let young people feel welcome to an altar let young well sometimes you old people excuse me for this but sometimes you need to feel welcome back to an altar again sometimes you need to show our young people it ain't wrong to get down there and cry and snot and look just awful at an altar anymore why because we made such a form of godliness out of this thing that we're scared to get messy but a birth is a mess and if our young people got to get messy to have a birth I say let them get messy I say let them get down with God I say let our young people get on fire for God again I say let the young people don't lose what you got at Youth Camp but get back on fire for God again let God move upon you I I I think we need to do that I say don't let nothing hinder you don't you you start feeling a cold formal Spirit come among us I say don't let that hinder you from what you feel God moving in your heart to do don't let anything hinder you well come on somebody I I I think you need to watch your friends I think you need to watch those relationships make sure the devil's not in there using those things to distract you from your full potential in the house of God stand to your feet if you would I want to live the way he wants me to live can we do that one I I wonder you young people I don't want to make altar calls every time we have a youth service but I want you to know that if there's a desire in your heart to go to an altar you need to be at that altar well we don't have time you've always got time for the main thing oh yeah we may not always have time for work we may not always have time for the things of the world we may not always have time for vacation but we've got time for the main thing eternity awaits you you've got to youve got to let the main thing be the main [Music] thing we're not we're not here to play Church we're not here just to have another Services check a box we had three services this week that's not the goal the goal is to see a young oh come on somebody the goal is to see somebody here when a Rapture takes place that is ready to meet him when he comes whatever that takes whatever it takes if it takes getting myself out of the way if it takes getting yourself out of the way parents if it takes you getting back on your knees in an altar again if it takes you getting yourself out of the way again I say don't let the distractions hinder our children from getting their blessings in the house of God the devil's a distractor but don't miss the attraction this attraction is not something that the the devil put on the side of the road but this is this is the goal at the end of the season you're in a season at the end of this long ruing hard season when you've played every down and you're beat and you're battered and you're hurt and you get down there and you hold the trophy it will be worth it all then it's worth it all when you get to the end see along the way it's just distractions just little things here a little things there but at the end is that's where it all matters so I want you to sing this and I want you young people to think about it do you want to live like he wants you to live do you want to love like he wants you to love put God first ahead of your friends you can have friends but put God first is God pleased with my present company is God pleased with who I'm hanging out with is God pleased with how I'm spending my alone time is God pleased with how often I read the Bible is he pleased with my worship come on somebody is God pleased with your worship this afternoon if he's not I wish somebody would just please the Lord and worship him because he deserves the glory he deserves the honor when you get down to the end and you're holding that trophy it's
