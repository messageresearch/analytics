[40:03] we'll just read this one verse and I'll
[40:05] let you be seated
[40:10] says restore unto me
[40:13] the joy of thy salvation
[40:16] and uphold me

[40:39] are the same yesterday today and forever
[40:42] you don't change oh God we're thankful
[40:45] for that Lord I pray that you would just
[40:48] move over this audience tonight Lord
[40:50] these people that are here order more
[40:52] than an audience we're a congregation
[40:54] Lord we're Believers Lord and we're
[40:57] we're pulling together we're believing
[40:59] together Lord that the sick will be
[41:01] healed and and the blind eyes will open
[41:04] and those who have spiritual problems or
[41:07] those problems can their questions can
[41:10] be answered and the problems can be
[41:12] fixed or we we believe you're that kind
[41:14] of a god tonight and I pray God that
[41:16] you'd move aside the tiredness and
[41:18] whatever else it is that we feel and
[41:20] that we would we would press forward oh
[41:22] God into your presence tonight hear your
[41:25] word Lord and Feast on the things of God
[41:28] for you granted now heal every sick
[41:30] person touch everyone we pray in Jesus
[41:32] name amen God bless you you can be
[41:35] seated
[41:37] in this country we know we have freedom
[41:40] to worship but I wonder how often that
[41:44] we worship in Freedom
[41:46] because it's a different thing we have
[41:48] freedom to worship and I thank God for
[41:51] that we shouldn't take that for granted
[41:52] because men have died so that we could
[41:56] have freedom to worship God and and and
[41:59] we we are glad of that I I've been in
[42:02] countries where they don't have the
[42:03] freedoms that we do and I thank God for
[42:06] what we have and I've been in places
[42:08] where they use some emergency or
[42:10] something to to quieten the people and
[42:13] we've preached in places where it was
[42:15] dangerous to your health to stand and
[42:17] preach the gospel we we've stood there
[42:19] and done that when they had guards
[42:21] outside the building with shotguns
[42:23] waiting because somebody might come and
[42:25] blow the place up we've got freedom to
[42:27] worship and we ought to take advantage
[42:29] of that
[42:31] because it's a rare condition listen to
[42:33] me tonight it's a rare condition freedom
[42:36] of worship is not found in many places
[42:39] in the world in fact it was a completely
[42:42] novel idea when it was presented here
[42:45] there's very few places in the world
[42:47] that have what we have even our our
[42:50] neighbors in Canada and our in our
[42:53] people over in Great Britain they don't
[42:55] have the freedoms that we do
[42:58] to be able to preach the word but I'm so
[43:00] glad I can preach it like it says it
[43:02] aren't you glad of that because we we
[43:05] can we can hear it still and we can
[43:07] still believe it and we can still
[43:09] congregate together and it means
[43:12] something to have freedom of worship but
[43:13] historically people have not had that
[43:16] but what they what that's have been
[43:18] reserved for the nobility
[43:20] it's been reserved for people of noble
[43:23] birth yeah are you with me tonight that
[43:26] historically that's what it's been
[43:27] reserved for freedom of worship for me
[43:30] to really be free to be able to choose
[43:32] where I wanted to go to church and what
[43:35] I wanted to do in church was dependent
[43:38] on me being of noble birth
[43:40] because if I was a person that just the
[43:43] Mir the many slaves and servants and and
[43:46] and all the people that were under the
[43:49] king or under the Nobles those people
[43:51] didn't have rights
[43:53] to be able to worship how they felt
[43:55] that's why this nation was founded
[43:58] so now but now we have freedom of
[44:01] worship but we do do we have freedom in
[44:03] worship
[44:07] restore to me the joy of your salvation
[44:09] and the Amplified version It's restored
[44:12] to me the joy of your salvation and
[44:14] uphold me with a willing Spirit great
[44:17] and that's the way most uh translations
[44:19] translate this is willing willing Spirit
[44:23] a free spirit a willing spirit that word
[44:25] means voluntary
[44:27] generous magnanimous
[44:30] he said a free liberal things a noble
[44:35] a prince
[44:37] willing
[44:39] to be willing yeah so a noble person you
[44:43] know to be nobility in olden times it
[44:45] was more than just being born a noble
[44:47] person but you were considered to have a
[44:50] noble attitude and so because you are
[44:53] given great things and you were born
[44:54] great that you were you were you were
[44:56] expected to be generous you were
[44:58] expected to be giving you were expected
[45:01] to be free with your time and your money
[45:03] because you were given great things
[45:05] and so the nobility was expected to be
[45:08] that way and so here here is King David
[45:10] crying out to God after he's committed a
[45:13] great room and he's crying out to God he
[45:15] said God restored to me the joy of your
[45:18] salvation and sustain me or uphold me
[45:22] with a willing spirit
[45:25] give me back my nobility
[45:28] oh I hope you understand you realize
[45:30] this country is a genius of this country
[45:32] is that it made us all Nobles
[45:35] right we have freedoms every one of us
[45:38] have rights people in other countries
[45:41] many of them did not have rights but we
[45:42] have rights
[45:43] and here he's saying restored to me
[45:46] restore to me that willing spirit that
[45:48] Noble spirit that one who would
[45:50] willingly give himself forgive his
[45:52] worship to God let me be someone who's
[45:55] willing to worship oh is that your
[45:58] prayer tonight let me be somebody who's
[46:00] willing let it restore to me the
[46:02] nobility
[46:03] of spirit and a thought
[46:05] and sin destroys that
[46:08] now brother Branham teaches us to speak
[46:11] of willingness he said the entire Bible
[46:12] is set up on Revelation
[46:14] he said you'll never know the Bible just
[46:16] by cold-hearted reading it
[46:18] you've got to read the Bible in the
[46:20] spirit
[46:21] you've got to be in the mood of reading
[46:24] you've got to love to read it
[46:26] and the Bible is written so that the
[46:29] wise smart educated will never
[46:31] understand it Jesus thanked God and said
[46:33] father I thank thee that thou has hid
[46:35] these things from the wise and prudent
[46:37] and will reveal them to babes such as
[46:39] we'll learn he said oh I'm so glad of
[46:41] that you don't have to be somebody in
[46:43] this world to know God aren't you glad
[46:45] of that you don't have to be a king or a
[46:47] noble according to this world to know
[46:49] God he said you have to have a willing
[46:52] heart
[46:53] and God will go to dealing with that
[46:56] willing heart if you are willing
[46:59] you see people that are restricted in
[47:01] their worship many times it's because
[47:03] the heart is not willing so David
[47:06] recognizing where that comes from he
[47:08] says restored to me a willing heart
[47:11] Hallelujah
[47:14] a noble again how to out of Freedom a
[47:16] prince out of Freedom the average person
[47:18] did not have
[47:20] we are the nobility of God how many
[47:22] believe that tonight
[47:24] we're his Kings and Priests the Bible
[47:27] said he has made us unto our God Kings
[47:29] and Priests and we shall reign on the
[47:32] Earth
[47:33] in Hebrews 13 15 by him therefore let us
[47:36] offer sacrifices the sacrifice of praise
[47:39] to God continually the fruit of our lips
[47:41] giving thanks to his name first Peter 2
[47:43] 5 you also as living stones are built up
[47:46] a spiritual house and a holy priesthood
[47:48] offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable
[47:50] to God by Jesus Christ so your nobility
[47:54] today
[47:55] tell us in the story about the man who
[47:58] come back from Africa and the slave and
[48:01] he come from Africa and here he was in
[48:03] the same condition as all the other
[48:05] slaves he had that he is at the same
[48:07] place and was whipped by the same task
[48:09] Masters he was in the same condition but
[48:12] he had a noble spirit
[48:14] yeah he had a noble spirit and and he
[48:17] was offering he he he acted in a certain
[48:20] way because that's the way the son of a
[48:22] king would act
[48:23] in Africa he was the son of a king don't
[48:26] you realize that's what we are today
[48:28] and there ought to be a willingness
[48:30] among Sons and Daughters of the king is
[48:32] anybody hearing me on a Sunday afternoon
[48:33] there ought to be a willingness among
[48:35] Sons and Daughters of the king to
[48:37] worship God with all of our hearts
[48:40] yes sir
[48:41] good my brother Ben I'm tired I am too
[48:44] but I believe our our God is Worthy
[48:50] yesterday and forever I believe
[48:51] I'm at least worthy of my praise today
[48:54] and I want to be Noble in my giving I
[48:57] want to I want to have that nobility
[48:58] that willingness about me that freedom
[49:02] now
[49:03] brother random he tells that story he
[49:05] said brother if we're living in the end
[49:07] time we're an alien that that boy was an
[49:09] alien that come back from Africa that
[49:11] man that comes from Africa he was an
[49:12] alien he said brother if we're living in
[49:14] the end time we're alien here
[49:17] to this formalism
[49:19] we are aliens to formalism
[49:22] and let me repeat that we're Alias to
[49:24] formalism and all kinds of things that's
[49:27] in the world we're in a world slavery
[49:29] and darkness
[49:30] he said the Christian church should
[49:32] conduct itself like real genuine
[49:34] born-again Sons and Daughters of God we
[49:37] should have that characteristic about us
[49:39] for our father is the king of glory and
[49:42] we are his subjects though we are in a
[49:43] sinful world he is the king of glory so
[49:46] David said restore unto me that sense of
[49:48] nobility
[49:50] Give Me Freedom
[49:52] Hallelujah
[49:55] so we have freedom so he tells us we
[49:57] have freedom from formalism what is
[49:58] formalism
[50:00] formalism is someone else's mode of
[50:05] worship
[50:07] other than the Kings
[50:10] right we have a king and we are Kings
[50:13] and Priests
[50:14] so whenever you hear someone talk about
[50:16] formalism formalism is someone else's
[50:19] mode of worship formalism could be uh
[50:22] could be Pentecostal it could be Baptist
[50:24] it could be Methodist but it's another
[50:26] form of worship other than the freedom
[50:29] of serving Christ
[50:31] see you don't have to take my form of
[50:33] worship I don't have to take your form
[50:35] of worship but you serve the king
[50:37] yourself you're a king you're a priest
[50:40] you offer to God a spiritual sacrifice
[50:43] so you don't have to copy somebody
[50:45] else's form of worship
[50:48] Hallelujah aren't you glad for that
[50:50] today
[50:51] brother Brown said say I feel religious
[50:53] I really do he said I feel like I can
[50:55] shout now
[50:56] he said when a Baptist goes to shouting
[50:59] it's really something
[51:01] see he had a Baptist formalism yes but
[51:04] when oh my when he realized who he was
[51:07] when he come out from those walls he got
[51:10] out of that formalism and he began to
[51:12] just serve God
[51:14] that's what we want I don't want to
[51:16] press people to do something they're not
[51:17] comfortable doing I don't want to work
[51:19] people up I don't want to do any of that
[51:20] but I want to serve God under the
[51:22] freedom of the spirit of God
[51:25] let me be free to worship God in my own
[51:28] way
[51:28] let me have freedom in worship
[51:31] hey man so when a Baptist goes to
[51:34] shouting he said it's really something
[51:35] oh my it's wonderful to serve the Lord
[51:37] and know it's thus saith the Lord he
[51:40] said it takes all the scarecrows out and
[51:42] the Spooks out and puts the holy spirit
[51:45] in there and lives with you with the
[51:48] dove of meekness and quietness
[51:50] Eternal hope in your heart how many have
[51:51] that today
[51:52] takes all the guests out all the Hocus
[51:55] Pocus sound all the formalism out of
[51:58] your heart
[51:58] puts a real no-sew in there and a faith
[52:01] that's Everlasting true
[52:03] oh my now what we want this afternoon
[52:06] brother Branham warned the people
[52:08] against formalism
[52:10] in whatever form that it takes
[52:13] he said he'll come in judgment upon the
[52:15] Nations he said while he's been revealed
[52:17] in Mercy oh hurry ye hither run quickly
[52:20] children get away from these man-made
[52:22] Babylonian theological walls of unbelief
[52:25] and cold formalism run away from
[52:27] man-made theology
[52:29] you shouldn't do that in church says who
[52:35] come on now if it's scriptural I want to
[52:37] stay in a scriptural order
[52:39] but when it comes to but but when it
[52:41] comes to your ideas
[52:43] I'm not under your form of worship
[52:47] I'm not it's not God and then you and
[52:49] then me
[52:50] so we should always be free to worship
[52:52] there should be there's no judgment
[52:54] because here God's up here
[52:57] and there's not it's not God and then
[52:59] the pastor and if the pastor says it's
[53:01] okay then I can do it that's not how
[53:03] that works
[53:05] but if your worship is pleasing to God
[53:07] that's the way it are that's who you
[53:09] should be concerned about and if it's
[53:10] pleasing to God it'll be according to
[53:12] the word
[53:13] right are you with me so far
[53:16] so I don't have to answer to you and you
[53:18] don't have to answer there's freedom in
[53:19] that isn't there there's Freedom I'm an
[53:22] individual in the house of God and I
[53:24] have a right to respond to the word the
[53:26] way I want to I got a right to respond
[53:28] to the house to the house of God I got a
[53:31] right to shout or not shout I gotta
[53:33] write this but I tell you what every
[53:34] time the word of God is preached it's
[53:36] just something inside of me I want to
[53:37] respond to it
[53:39] I'm not subject to your form of worship
[53:43] that's right are you with me now neither
[53:44] are you mine
[53:46] Hallelujah he said run away from those
[53:49] walls get out in the middle of the field

[53:53] in the middle of the field of God's
[53:55] grace at their screen for Mercy for it
[53:58] is his blood of his own son that gives
[54:00] the mercy to us get away from this whole

[54:25] minute oh God be merciful run people

[54:31] as you can get away from these modern
[54:33] walls of this formalism get into the
[54:35] middle of God's grace quickly oh you
[54:38] Baptist Methodist Pentecostal Nazarene
[54:40] Pilgrim Holiness Catholic all of you get
[54:42] away from these modern Church walls
[54:44] you feel like you're secure because it's
[54:46] a great church
[54:47] nothing against it but brother unless
[54:49] you're found in his grace covered with
[54:51] his goodness and his power what good
[54:53] will it do you
[54:55] the church won't save you so get away
[54:57] from those walls
[54:59] Hallelujah he talked about it why little
[55:02] Bethlehem you got to preach with me
[55:05] tonight
[55:06] why a little Beth to him I I'm kind of
[55:09] trying to push through for a reason I I
[55:11] don't want to leave you on a Sunday
[55:12] afternoon until somebody tired and and
[55:14] worried and worried about what's going
[55:16] to happen the week your mind starts to
[55:17] drift I I want to I want to focus you
[55:19] back on the word of God when our hearts
[55:22] to be focused back on the word of God
[55:24] I hear David brother Brown talks about
[55:27] David how that his Gentile Warriors
[55:29] wanted to bring him a drink
[55:31] because it was his desire that was
[55:34] expressed he didn't even tell them to do
[55:35] it but it was just an expressed desire
[55:38] all that I would have a drink of the
[55:40] well that's at Bethlehem
[55:42] and his men just went and did it
[55:44] because his wish was their command
[55:46] brother Brown said they knew one day he
[55:49] would be king and we know that one day
[55:51] Jesus would be king amen he's King to us
[55:54] and one day he'll be king over this
[55:56] Earth
[55:57] he's coming back to sit on the throne of
[55:59] David so he talked about how that these
[56:02] men were doing and he said the the
[56:04] garrisons of the Philistines in
[56:06] formalism he ties it to formalism that
[56:09] they had they had gathered they had
[56:11] garrisoned around Bethlehem
[56:13] but those three Gentile Warriors picked
[56:16] up their swords or at least two of them
[56:18] did if you've ever heard by the Daryl
[56:19] Ward preached on that he said two of
[56:21] them carried a sword one carried a
[56:22] bucket
[56:23] somebody had to carry the bucket
[56:25] but but the hair they they had Gentile
[56:28] Warriors had I had to face through all
[56:30] this thing they picked up their swords
[56:32] in their bucket and they walked through
[56:34] 15 miles they went through 15 miles of
[56:36] Philistines why did they do that why
[56:39] because they had to break the walls of
[56:41] formalism to get David a drink
[56:44] oh my sometimes we need to break the
[56:47] walls that are for holding us back from
[56:50] giving Christ a drink
[56:52] but I was raised like this and I come up
[56:54] in a church it was like this I just want
[56:56] you to be free to give Christ a dream if
[56:59] he wants a drink let's give him a drink
[57:02] yes sir
[57:06] oh he said oh brother
[57:08] I wonder if the Warriors today are
[57:09] willing to cut their ways how many are
[57:11] willing now I wonder if they're willing
[57:14] to cut through formally some doubts and
[57:17] unbelief to refresh in the presence of
[57:19] the Lord in his desires
[57:22] in this time of church world and church
[57:24] joining and formalism and things that we
[57:26] have in the world today lukewarm church
[57:28] members scoffers making fun having a
[57:30] form of Godless denying the power of the
[57:32] Holy Spirit which were commanded to turn
[57:34] from in that very hour of that Wicked
[57:36] adulterous generation Jesus Christ Rises
[57:39] and in the power of his resurrection to
[57:41] prove that he's Alive forevermore the
[57:43] same yesterday today and forever in this
[57:46] time of formalism this is the hour when
[57:48] we must be free
[57:50] in our worship
[57:52] oh my
[57:54] what else
[57:55] keeps us back formalism holds us back
[57:57] forms of worship Pride keeps us back
[58:02] we have a pride in our place
[58:05] many times in our place in whether it's
[58:08] the house where we worship the place
[58:09] where we worship for our church or our
[58:11] community or our family it's a pride in
[58:14] our position
[58:15] many times it keeps us from worshiping
[58:17] I'm not rebuking you today I'm just
[58:19] we're just trying to explain we want a
[58:21] free spirit we want we want the church
[58:23] to be able to be free we want to be able
[58:25] to worship according to dictator I
[58:27] should not feel like
[58:29] I should not feel like that I have to
[58:31] tone it down
[58:36] hope you're with me now now if it's a
[58:38] holy ghost in me I'm not going to do
[58:39] anything out of order
[58:41] and if I would I'm gonna read it to you
[58:42] in a minute if I would get out of order
[58:43] a little bit the holy spirit will set me
[58:45] right
[58:46] there's a word here to set us right
[58:48] we're going to get but we'll be balanced
[58:50] out
[58:52] but I should not be afraid to worship
[58:56] there shouldn't be a fear around the
[58:58] Church of whether or not well I'm I'm so
[59:01] afraid or a pride that keeps us from
[59:04] doing that yeah that's good brother
[59:06] Brown said that really Worship in a
[59:07] mission where it been swept out or a bar
[59:10] room
[59:14] think about it and have the freedom of
[59:17] the Holy Spirit and the love of God
[59:19] burning into the heart that sin in the
[59:21] greatest Cathedral that we got in the
[59:23] world and be cramped down with man's
[59:25] doctrines and dogmas yes
[59:27] the pride of places The Pride people get
[59:30] proud I'm gonna actually skip through
[59:32] this next one I'm just going to quote it
[59:34] to you but I've read the quote to you
[59:36] before but the random says what we need
[59:37] is an old-fashioned Jesus Christ
[59:39] entertaining place he said because
[59:41] you're afraid to entertain what your
[59:42] neighbor will see you're afraid of what
[59:44] somebody else might say but you need to
[59:46] worship he said worship you invited him
[59:48] you asked him to come worship him when
[59:50] he come
[59:51] [Applause]
[59:52] Proverbs 16 and 18. who's speaking of
[59:56] pride pride goes Before Destruction
[59:59] how many have found that to be true
[1:00:02] Pride goeth Before Destruction it's the
[1:00:05] next scripture I'm sorry I I skip Way
[1:00:08] Forward
[1:00:09] Proverbs 16 and 18 Pride goeth Before
[1:00:12] Destruction and a haughty spirit before
[1:00:15] a fall
[1:00:17] right Pride removes you from your place
[1:00:20] in as a prince
[1:00:23] you want scripture for that Daniel 4 37
[1:00:25] go read Daniel 4. it talks about
[1:00:27] Nebuchadnezzar he was a king
[1:00:29] he was a noble he had a had a noble
[1:00:32] Spirit he had a noble Place position but
[1:00:36] he got proud
[1:00:37] he started looking around said see what
[1:00:39] I've done yeah and God said I'm going to
[1:00:41] show this world ruler
[1:00:44] amen I'm still God in heaven
[1:00:47] oh my I believe God's still doing that
[1:00:49] today I'm going to show this world ruler
[1:00:51] I'm still God in heaven I'm still
[1:00:53] Jehovah I still have control over world
[1:00:55] affairs and so he makes him he calls it
[1:00:58] an insane Spirit to come on him and he
[1:01:00] goes out in the wilderness and starts to
[1:01:01] eat grass like a cow
[1:01:04] his fingernails got long and he's out
[1:01:07] there with no clothes on eating grass of
[1:01:09] the field a king
[1:01:13] why Pride
[1:01:15] went before a fall
[1:01:18] Pride took away his willing Spirit Pride
[1:01:20] took away his ability to give well how
[1:01:23] many times have I seen people that got
[1:01:25] proud and they got arrogant and they got
[1:01:27] better clothes than a better and they
[1:01:28] forgot and they started they ceased from
[1:01:30] worshiping God they began to be absent
[1:01:32] from church and they begin to be absent
[1:01:34] from a place of worship they forgot to
[1:01:36] lift their hands they forgot to praise
[1:01:38] God for the room said it's like the pig
[1:01:39] Under The Apple Tree the but the apples
[1:01:41] are just falling he don't ever look up
[1:01:43] and see where it comes from
[1:01:45] and Nebuchadnezzar ended up
[1:01:47] in this place in Daniel 4 37 he said now
[1:01:50] after he'd been restored he said now I
[1:01:53] nebuchadne has some praise and it stole
[1:01:55] and honored the king of Heaven
[1:01:57] he got his worship back when he realized
[1:01:59] when he recovered from that because he
[1:02:01] realized I'm not God
[1:02:04] if you'd realize you weren't God you'd
[1:02:05] worship God a lot more
[1:02:07] [Applause]
[1:02:09] come on church we spend all our time
[1:02:12] judging somebody else and worried about
[1:02:14] what somebody else is doing if you'd
[1:02:15] recognize you're not God you might lift
[1:02:17] your hands once in a while and worship
[1:02:19] God
[1:02:21] amen
[1:02:23] hey man he said no I Nebuchadnezzar
[1:02:25] praise and it's stolen honor the king of
[1:02:26] Heaven all whose works are truth and his
[1:02:28] ways judgment and those that walk in
[1:02:30] Pride he is able to abase
[1:02:34] well it's our freedom and worship it's
[1:02:36] Freedom From Fear
[1:02:38] Freedom From Fear
[1:02:41] there's some people who are afraid to
[1:02:42] worship because they might get in the
[1:02:44] flesh and displease God
[1:02:47] I think we've all felt that way at some
[1:02:48] point
[1:02:49] and some of it's a result of false
[1:02:51] teaching
[1:02:53] but the random talked about that woman
[1:02:55] who washed Jesus feet
[1:02:56] and he said this he said could you lay
[1:02:58] down aside all your worldly social
[1:03:00] entertainment to come to the Lord Jesus
[1:03:02] to be entertained by him
[1:03:04] to God have mercy she elbowed right on
[1:03:06] through she was going to get there
[1:03:07] regardless of how vile she was
[1:03:09] right he said oh I know it was out of
[1:03:11] order
[1:03:13] it wasn't it wasn't an order for her to
[1:03:15] do that
[1:03:16] said God help us to get out of order
[1:03:17] once in a while
[1:03:19] he said the trouble of it is you got too
[1:03:21] much order
[1:03:22] I see we're balancing these things out
[1:03:24] we preach on Church order lately and I
[1:03:26] believe in church order but every once
[1:03:28] in a while you need to make sure that
[1:03:30] Jesus has what he has a need you need to
[1:03:33] meet that need
[1:03:35] you need to worship him when he comes
[1:03:38] get out of order he said hope the church
[1:03:39] gets out of order long enough to get
[1:03:41] saved
[1:03:42] he said I remember when Jesus saved me
[1:03:44] you want to hear about brother Brandon's
[1:03:46] salvation experience I remember when
[1:03:48] Jesus saved me he said oh my I never
[1:03:50] forget it he said this little old
[1:03:52] Kentucky heart of mine was jumping 90
[1:03:54] miles an hour I wept I cried I shouted I
[1:03:57] don't care who was standing around I
[1:03:58] wasn't paying attention to order I was
[1:04:01] in the presence of Jesus
[1:04:03] I loved him
[1:04:05] Hallelujah
[1:04:07] oh he tells the story about the eagle
[1:04:09] and about how the Eagles watching we
[1:04:11] we've used it recently Eagles watching
[1:04:12] all the little chicks All the Little
[1:04:14] Eagles running around they're running
[1:04:16] around in the grass tumbling over one
[1:04:18] another
[1:04:18] flopping and everything else and then
[1:04:21] Mama Eagles just watching
[1:04:23] and brother Brandon says this little
[1:04:24] Eagle just a flopping around he said you
[1:04:26] know they're having a Pentecostal
[1:04:28] Jubilee just a shouting and a jumping he
[1:04:31] said they believe if my mother took them
[1:04:32] up there
[1:04:33] oh I love this
[1:04:35] mother can take care of them
[1:04:39] so they're free
[1:04:41] they're worshiping free they're down
[1:04:43] there in the green grass it's so soft
[1:04:45] it's so nice
[1:04:47] and then unaware of the danger
[1:04:50] said a coyote could come in a wolf could
[1:04:53] come in a cougar could come in and grab
[1:04:55] them little them little eaglets but
[1:04:57] before they could get oh my before the
[1:05:00] wolf could get there Mama Eagle would be
[1:05:03] there
[1:05:04] before the cougar could get there Mama
[1:05:05] Eagle would be there to bring a balance
[1:05:09] are you whisping out say well I might
[1:05:11] get in the flesh a little bit he's
[1:05:12] watching over you
[1:05:15] you shouldn't fear that
[1:05:17] because Mama Eagles watching over you to
[1:05:20] watch when you get a confession a little
[1:05:21] bit to balance you out
[1:05:24] Oh my he said they believe it mother
[1:05:27] took them up there mother can take care
[1:05:29] of them if God told me to trust him I'll
[1:05:30] just trust him
[1:05:32] I don't care how topsy-turvy I get he
[1:05:34] will help me out somehow I don't know
[1:05:36] but the only thing I know what to flop
[1:05:38] my wings all the faith I've got he said
[1:05:39] in the New and Old Testament
[1:05:41] he said oh my fluff them back and forth
[1:05:43] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:05:45] and forever just keep on flopping and
[1:05:46] flying somehow or another if he sends a
[1:05:49] rushing Mighty Wind he throws all the
[1:05:51] loose feathers out he said you can stand
[1:05:52] it or he wouldn't take you up there
[1:05:55] just put your trust in him one time see
[1:05:57] what he'll do that's your solo flight
[1:06:00] Oh my he said just flop then
[1:06:05] just keep on whether going up
[1:06:07] or down or whichever way you're doing
[1:06:10] mother's standing right out there
[1:06:11] soaring right around
[1:06:14] say well I don't worship very good I'm
[1:06:16] not as good at worshiping as some others
[1:06:18] since when did worship become a
[1:06:20] performance
[1:06:24] I'm not good at it when you have to be
[1:06:26] good at worshiping God
[1:06:30] just flop
[1:06:33] that's what the prophet said
[1:06:37] Hallelujah Mama Eagle's out there
[1:06:39] somewhere his eyes on the sparrow and I
[1:06:42] know he watches me in and out of his
[1:06:43] church he said to see if you get out of
[1:06:46] topsy-turvy something will happen the
[1:06:48] big wings the word of God will bring you
[1:06:51] right up right back up he said somebody
[1:06:53] said that's Wildfire I'd rather have a
[1:06:55] little Wildfire than no fire at all yes
[1:06:57] sir
[1:06:57] [Applause]
[1:06:59] I worry about Wildfire but I'm scared to
[1:07:03] death with no fire
[1:07:06] are you with me now you worry about
[1:07:08] Wildfire but I'm scared to death with no
[1:07:10] fire without fire you'll freeze to death
[1:07:13] it's a cold world out there without fire
[1:07:15] you'll freeze to death I don't want I
[1:07:17] don't want it to be wildfire and be out
[1:07:18] of control but but I'd rather have
[1:07:19] wildfires than no fire at all
[1:07:22] and if you have a balance of the word
[1:07:24] it's a false dilemma it's a false choice
[1:07:26] you don't have to be out of control to
[1:07:29] worship God
[1:07:31] but it might help to get away from
[1:07:32] formalism
[1:07:33] a little bit to worship God
[1:07:36] again some of us just aren't that
[1:07:39] expressive that's okay
[1:07:41] that's all right some people don't
[1:07:43] worship the way other people worship but
[1:07:45] you're you're you're you're you're a
[1:07:47] king you're a priest
[1:07:48] you're offering spiritual sacrifice in
[1:07:51] yourself in whatever way brother JT that
[1:07:53] God moves on your heart be free and do
[1:07:56] that
[1:07:56] [Applause]
[1:07:59] and then if it's so if it's God it won't
[1:08:01] get out of order if it does the word
[1:08:03] will call it out
[1:08:05] that's why we have pastors and
[1:08:06] evangelists and Prophets and teachers
[1:08:08] and five a five-fold Ministry
[1:08:12] Apostle we have those because it's to
[1:08:14] keep the church balanced keep them
[1:08:15] corrected the word of God now he said
[1:08:18] just think he said he said uh think if
[1:08:21] it's just a little out of order he said
[1:08:23] why we'll just catch him on the wing
[1:08:25] just exactly what it is bring them back
[1:08:27] into Grace again
[1:08:28] let them flop
[1:08:32] I like that
[1:08:34] that's why I told you even preaching on
[1:08:36] tongues and stuff there is an order to
[1:08:38] that but I want to be careful because I
[1:08:40] don't want to discourage you from
[1:08:41] getting in the presence of God
[1:08:43] such a place where your language changes
[1:08:45] and you're just lost in the spirit of
[1:08:48] God I don't want to discourage you from
[1:08:49] that yet there is an order in the church
[1:08:50] you understand but God will set that
[1:08:53] order he said just let them flop
[1:08:55] Oh my he said just let them flop he said
[1:08:58] he said yes sir just let them go ahead
[1:09:00] and Shout praise the Lord and holler
[1:09:02] Hallelujah dance in the spirit whatever
[1:09:03] they want to do he said if they get out
[1:09:05] of order we got something here The Wings
[1:09:07] God will I love this God will never let
[1:09:10] you drop
[1:09:11] if you're an eagle
[1:09:13] [Applause]
[1:09:15] why do we spend all of our time can you
[1:09:18] imagine how sad the little Eagle it
[1:09:20] would be if he's down there in the grass
[1:09:22] I don't know who I'm preaching to
[1:09:23] tonight but you listen you're down there
[1:09:25] in the grass of God's goodness you're
[1:09:27] just rolling around in it oh you have
[1:09:29] troubles and trials and tribulation but
[1:09:31] everything's taken care of he promised
[1:09:33] he'd feed you he promised he'd take care
[1:09:35] of you he promised he'd be with you he'd
[1:09:37] never leave you he's there watching over
[1:09:40] you yeah that little Eagle sitting there
[1:09:42] yeah we've all seen uh We've maybe had
[1:09:45] children like that they're afraid to
[1:09:46] move
[1:09:48] you know
[1:09:50] they're looking around I guess I just
[1:09:51] want you to enjoy yourself
[1:09:53] you're seeing a kid go to a park and so
[1:09:55] worried about the equipment
[1:09:57] if I've been hearing mom and talk about
[1:09:59] it too much
[1:10:00] you can break your neck
[1:10:03] get out there and want to wear a helmet
[1:10:04] isn't it wonderful I'm just being myself
[1:10:06] tonight you just just forgive me but
[1:10:09] isn't it nice when you see a little
[1:10:10] child that's willing to play
[1:10:13] be a kid
[1:10:15] you just go out there on the jungle gym
[1:10:17] and wherever that it is I mean I mean
[1:10:19] come on we survived childhood
[1:10:22] we had them them merry-go-rounds that
[1:10:24] were metal and they kept going faster
[1:10:26] and faster we never did get one to top
[1:10:28] speed brother Joe
[1:10:31] I think spin you off
[1:10:33] breaking armor leg
[1:10:36] but you were children
[1:10:39] you were free and brother Madam tells us
[1:10:41] God wants us to be happy and free like
[1:10:43] little children living before the father
[1:10:46] he don't want to sit there worrying oh
[1:10:47] where's my next meal coming from what am
[1:10:49] I gonna do what what am I going to say
[1:10:50] I'm not mocking you tonight but just
[1:10:53] remember he he's up there he's up there
[1:10:55] he's watching over you
[1:10:58] he will never let you drop if you're an
[1:11:00] eagle
[1:11:01] he will pick you up back up again he
[1:11:04] said now if you're a buzzard you're
[1:11:05] falling anyhow
[1:11:08] yeah so you'll just splash on the ground
[1:11:09] but if you're a real Eagle I believe
[1:11:12] you're a real Eagle tonight you wouldn't
[1:11:14] be here on a Sunday afternoon I want to
[1:11:16] hear the word of God if you're illegal
[1:11:17] you'll listen to the word of God you'll
[1:11:19] know that's mother's Wing bringing you
[1:11:21] back to Grace again
[1:11:22] [Applause]
[1:11:25] some have been taught I was taught this
[1:11:28] that if someone tells you to raise your
[1:11:30] hands or clap your hands you shouldn't
[1:11:31] do it
[1:11:33] it's nonsense
[1:11:35] I can prove that by the word
[1:11:38] why would you
[1:11:40] say well if I feel led I'll worship why
[1:11:42] would you need to feel led
[1:11:44] to worship God
[1:11:49] come on
[1:11:51] imagine a great king
[1:11:54] of England you know and some little
[1:11:56] squirt comes up in front of him says
[1:11:58] well if I fill in I'll bow down
[1:12:02] he gonna feel led
[1:12:07] fulfill LED
[1:12:09] that's what worship means by the way is
[1:12:11] to prostrate yourself that's what the
[1:12:12] word means to prostrate yourself before
[1:12:14] a king
[1:12:16] oh God imagine well I if I feel led I
[1:12:20] well I lift my hands in a song service
[1:12:22] but until I do I'm gonna keep them down
[1:12:24] all you do is quenching the spirit
[1:12:28] huh
[1:12:29] because if everybody was perfectly lead
[1:12:30] we wouldn't need song leaders
[1:12:33] or pastors
[1:12:35] preachers
[1:12:37] we just all come and each one have a
[1:12:38] word testimony that's not the way God
[1:12:40] ordained it
[1:12:42] yeah
[1:12:43] sometimes you got to worship when you
[1:12:44] don't feel in
[1:12:47] it you say where where's your scripture
[1:12:49] for that I'm glad you asked Psalm 47 and
[1:12:51] 1.
[1:12:52] said oh clap your hands all you people
[1:12:55] oh
[1:12:56] that is that what that says but to be
[1:12:58] like I got my glasses I think he says
[1:13:00] all
[1:13:01] clap your hands all you people yeah
[1:13:04] shout unto God with the voice of Triumph
[1:13:07] yes well he's trying to tell me what to
[1:13:10] do yes he is
[1:13:14] well that's not the New Testament okay
[1:13:16] first Timothy two and eight I will
[1:13:18] therefore
[1:13:19] that men pray everywhere lifting up holy
[1:13:22] hands yes
[1:13:24] yes David says clap Paul says lift your
[1:13:27] hands
[1:13:30] are you with me so far
[1:13:33] the man says oh my don't you feel good
[1:13:35] think friends this is Pentecost worship
[1:13:39] this is Pentecost let's clap our hands
[1:13:41] and sing it
[1:13:43] Pentecostal people everybody now loosen
[1:13:45] up get that old Methodist formality out
[1:13:48] of you now come on let's see well they
[1:13:49] didn't do that in my church okay
[1:13:52] they do they did in brother Brandon's
[1:13:54] Church
[1:13:55] [Music]
[1:13:56] again he said now to get the coldness
[1:13:58] off and the shackles broke from around
[1:14:01] us the Spooks drove away he said what's
[1:14:03] the matter people can't you realize that
[1:14:05] we're entering in after the message into
[1:14:07] a spirit of worship
[1:14:10] sometimes I'm so tired but I just I want
[1:14:13] to stay out here with you all but many
[1:14:14] times I'll go in the back and I hate it
[1:14:16] though when the worship shuts down I
[1:14:18] don't mean you have to linger but
[1:14:19] sometimes it's just right
[1:14:21] and we need to worship a little bit I
[1:14:23] hate to go in the back because I feel
[1:14:25] like if I leave the platform everybody
[1:14:26] it's time to go
[1:14:28] but you're not worshiping me on it great
[1:14:32] you don't you don't normally worship
[1:14:34] when the Pastors in the building
[1:14:36] to get you realize we're entering in
[1:14:38] after the message into a spirit of
[1:14:40] worship let's just raise our hands to
[1:14:42] God he said and worship him and say
[1:14:44] praise the Lord praise be to God thanks
[1:14:46] be to the father who gives us the Son of
[1:14:48] God resurrected from the dead alive
[1:14:50] forever more Alpha Omega the beginning
[1:14:52] and the end the rose of Sharon the lily
[1:14:54] of the valley the Morning Star he that
[1:14:56] was which is it shall come the root and
[1:14:58] offspring of David was some worship
[1:15:01] right here he said how we praise you
[1:15:02] almighty God for your Omni presence for
[1:15:05] your visitation to us tonight for the
[1:15:06] power of your Resurrection for the
[1:15:08] Assurance of salvation for your great
[1:15:10] manifestation of your word in this last
[1:15:12] phase that you promised you would do it
[1:15:14] in the face of criticism and formalities
[1:15:16] and everything else you still remain God
[1:15:18] the same God yesterday today and forever
[1:15:20] how we thank you for it father
[1:15:22] he said oh don't you feel good
[1:15:25] say praise the Lord
[1:15:27] he said oh that don't sound like
[1:15:28] Pentecost to me
[1:15:30] praise the Lord
[1:15:32] that sounds better
[1:15:35] Hallelujah he goes on he tells him glory
[1:15:38] to God I love Jesus praise God he's
[1:15:40] telling them what to say
[1:15:42] oh brother Ben we was raised not to do
[1:15:44] that
[1:15:47] only when we feel that if I only felt
[1:15:49] preached when I felt led to preach I
[1:15:51] would rarely preach
[1:15:53] that's just the truth
[1:15:56] and I appreciate when I do have that
[1:15:57] opportunity to and many times I preach
[1:15:59] what I feel led but not necessarily when
[1:16:01] I feel led
[1:16:03] but the Bible says I'd be instant in
[1:16:04] season and out of season
[1:16:06] it's part of the qualifications of my
[1:16:08] office being a pastor you understand
[1:16:11] right you're a spiritual priest
[1:16:15] a priest had to be ready to go in every
[1:16:17] year or every time he had to go into the
[1:16:19] holy of holies he had to be ready well
[1:16:21] it wasn't optional yeah go in
[1:16:24] and every time you come to the house of
[1:16:25] God it ought to be something in your
[1:16:27] heart Lord I'm going to worship you
[1:16:28] today
[1:16:29] I'm going to offer spiritual sacrifice I
[1:16:31] may not feel like it but it's my it's my
[1:16:33] job and my privilege as the king of the
[1:16:36] priests very few people can worship in
[1:16:38] freedom but I will
[1:16:42] we have freedom from Fear freedom from
[1:16:44] condemnation
[1:16:45] yes we get to this then we'll close
[1:16:47] the Bible says there is therefore now
[1:16:49] someone say now
[1:16:51] there's therefore now no condemnation to
[1:16:53] them which are in Christ Jesus walk not
[1:16:55] after the flesh but after the spirit now
[1:16:57] this this verse is not telling you that
[1:16:59] you don't feel condemned
[1:17:02] it says you are not condemned
[1:17:07] think about it
[1:17:09] think about it I want you to think about
[1:17:10] it he said there's therefore now no
[1:17:12] condemnation it means that the sentence
[1:17:15] has been passed look at that the word
[1:17:17] for uh for condemnation it's the verdict
[1:17:21] there is no verdict
[1:17:23] the devil can indict you
[1:17:26] but you'll be as free as Donald Trump
[1:17:32] I have to Loosely up a little bit
[1:17:36] he can indict you that's his job
[1:17:39] hate to break
[1:17:40] it to break it up
[1:17:42] to a day that's what he does
[1:17:44] but you don't have to live under
[1:17:45] condemnation
[1:17:46] because you know the word yes that says
[1:17:50] there is therefore now now no
[1:17:53] condemnation
[1:17:54] means whatever I did whatever the crime
[1:17:57] was there is therefore now no
[1:17:59] condemnation regardless of how I feel
[1:18:03] so I can worship with all of my heart
[1:18:05] because I am now free I am not a save
[1:18:09] anymore I am not in bondage anymore
[1:18:11] these shackles do not hold me anymore
[1:18:14] the devil has no legal right to hold you
[1:18:17] there is therefore now no condemnation
[1:18:19] [Applause]
[1:18:22] so will I wait till I quit feeling
[1:18:24] condemned you'll never worship
[1:18:27] yes sir but if you'll worship the
[1:18:30] condemnation will slip away
[1:18:32] all right are you with me now
[1:18:34] brother Branham talked about those
[1:18:35] slaves that were waiting for
[1:18:37] emancipation day they were waiting on
[1:18:39] the sunrise for the bill they were
[1:18:41] sitting at home they were on the hill
[1:18:42] and they were waiting they were all up
[1:18:44] and down the hill there was somebody at
[1:18:45] the top that as soon as the sun come up
[1:18:48] he passed the word along it's
[1:18:50] emancipation day we're free
[1:18:53] we're free and the next one said we're
[1:18:55] free we're free it might have taken some
[1:18:57] time but when the one at the bottom of
[1:18:58] the hill he may not have been able to
[1:19:00] see the Sun but he heard the message
[1:19:02] said I'm free there is therefore now no
[1:19:05] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[1:19:07] Jesus I'm free
[1:19:09] doesn't mean you won't ever don't mean
[1:19:11] you'll always feel free yeah
[1:19:14] you're free
[1:19:15] you are free it's a greater thing than
[1:19:18] feeling free
[1:19:20] you are free
[1:19:23] what makes you feel free is your faith
[1:19:26] in that promise
[1:19:30] that's good glory to God
[1:19:32] now but the parent said he talked about
[1:19:35] him says he said how much more ought we
[1:19:37] to be waiting today for the Son of God
[1:19:38] we're free from sin we're free from
[1:19:41] shackles we're free from Habits we're
[1:19:43] free from smoking drinking crowding some
[1:19:46] of you ought to be able to say Amen to
[1:19:47] that because the Son of God has raised
[1:19:50] from the grave and has broke every
[1:19:51] fatter
[1:19:53] all condemnation is gone
[1:19:56] the debt has been paid the penalty has
[1:19:58] paid the sins are washed away and we are
[1:20:01] free oh we are free people slavery
[1:20:03] Freedom when the Son of God Rises with
[1:20:06] healing in his wings
[1:20:07] he said someday he'll rise from the
[1:20:09] throne come back to the Earth and then
[1:20:10] we'll be free oh there's coming a day
[1:20:12] church will be free from these bodies
[1:20:14] we'll be free from all pain and all
[1:20:16] temptation free from all Mortal aches
[1:20:18] and whatever goes with Mortal life to
[1:20:20] live with him forever look at Revelation
[1:20:22] 12 and 9 it says the Great Dragon was
[1:20:24] cast out that old serpent called the
[1:20:26] devil and Satan which deceives the whole
[1:20:27] world he was cast out of the earth as
[1:20:29] Angels were cast out with him verse 10
[1:20:31] and I heard a loud voice saying in
[1:20:33] heaven now has come salvation and
[1:20:35] strength in the Kingdom of our God and
[1:20:37] the power of His Christ for the Accuser
[1:20:40] the prosecutor that made the that
[1:20:43] indicted you
[1:20:44] that made the accusation has been cast
[1:20:47] down
[1:20:48] oh Hallelujah the accused of our
[1:20:51] Brothers cast down which accused him
[1:20:53] before our God day and night and listen
[1:20:54] and they overcame him by the blood of
[1:20:57] the Lamb
[1:20:58] there's therefore now no condemnation
[1:21:02] and by the word of their testimony who
[1:21:04] walked not after the flesh but after the
[1:21:05] spirit
[1:21:07] who don't believe the the dictates of
[1:21:09] the flesh but believe what the word says
[1:21:18] you realize what they did
[1:21:20] John is presenting that like a courtroom
[1:21:23] said the accuser that word in the it's
[1:21:25] prosecutor
[1:21:27] the prosecutor is cast down
[1:21:29] the prosecutor has been found out
[1:21:31] he was Prosecuting for political
[1:21:33] purposes
[1:21:39] he's been found out
[1:21:42] Hallelujah are you free today
[1:21:45] [Music]
[1:21:46] you got to stand up in your own defense
[1:21:48] stuff
[1:21:51] glory to God you've been made free the
[1:21:53] verdict from the the judge came in
[1:21:55] our day and said you're free
[1:21:58] but he said the word of their testimony
[1:22:00] that's them standing in their own
[1:22:01] defense
[1:22:03] I'm free
[1:22:05] a pardon is not a pardon unless it's
[1:22:07] accepted it's one thing for the judge to
[1:22:09] face free it's one thing for the accuser
[1:22:11] to be cast down but it's another thing
[1:22:13] for me to stand in my own defense I'm
[1:22:16] free I will not believe what the devil
[1:22:18] tells me about me I will not believe
[1:22:20] that I'm Bound for hell I will not
[1:22:23] believe I'm not a Believer I will not
[1:22:24] believe I'm not a Christian I will not
[1:22:26] believe that I have to sit on my hands
[1:22:28] all the time and do nothing I believe
[1:22:30] I'm a born-again Child of God
[1:22:32] [Music]
[1:22:34] free from condemnation free from Fear
[1:22:37] free from formality
[1:22:41] how am I going and that's what David's
[1:22:42] saying he said restore unto me the joy
[1:22:44] of my salvation uphold me sustain me
[1:22:47] keep me free by your free spirit your
[1:22:51] Noble spiritual willing spirit
[1:22:53] pill dice free spirit
[1:22:56] but the brand said there's people
[1:22:57] sitting here that's considered crazy
[1:22:59] because they're ready to trust God for
[1:23:01] their healing for their Eternal
[1:23:03] destination placing their reputation at
[1:23:06] stake in worship to him thanking him
[1:23:09] praising him giving freedom to their
[1:23:12] spirit
[1:23:13] sir
[1:23:15] Ben I wish it was freedom in my church
[1:23:17] have you given freedom to your spirit
[1:23:22] if you think about it
[1:23:24] have you given freedom to yourself have
[1:23:26] you stood up in your own defense
[1:23:28] not to the pastor not the people around
[1:23:30] you but to Satan
[1:23:33] say I'm a Child of God
[1:23:35] I belong in the house of God
[1:23:37] I'm standing up in my own defense I will
[1:23:39] not defend what I did
[1:23:41] I will not defend my actions will not
[1:23:44] defend when I was a sinner are you with
[1:23:45] me now but my defense is based solely on
[1:23:49] the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:23:51] and overcoming him his cast down because
[1:23:54] because of the blood of the lamb and the
[1:23:56] word of my testimony
[1:24:00] giving freedom to their Spirit to
[1:24:01] worship God they're considered crazy but
[1:24:05] you said that the foolishness of God if
[1:24:07] we are fools what's stronger and wiser
[1:24:09] than the wisdom of man for a man by
[1:24:11] wisdom no not God but through the
[1:24:13] foolishness of preaching it pleased God
[1:24:15] to save them that was savable I was
[1:24:17] savable or I wouldn't have been saved
[1:24:22] of the spirit of Life musicians go ahead
[1:24:24] and come the law of the spirit of Life
[1:24:26] In Christ hath made me free from the law
[1:24:28] of sin and death for what the law could
[1:24:30] not do in that it was weak through the
[1:24:32] flesh God sending his own son in the
[1:24:35] likeness of sinful flesh for sin
[1:24:37] condemns sin in the flesh this is why
[1:24:40] there is therefore now no condemnation
[1:24:43] to them that are in Christ Jesus no
[1:24:46] verdict
[1:24:47] no verdict
[1:24:49] no one to tell you you're guilty just
[1:24:51] like the woman it was caught in adultery
[1:24:55] and Jesus said where are your accusers
[1:24:58] she looked around and they're gone
[1:25:00] everyone I'm God Satan oh God
[1:25:03] oh my in the face of the blood
[1:25:06] Satan had to had to had to fall from his
[1:25:09] position as accuser
[1:25:11] and every one of his imps and his demons
[1:25:13] and people he gets a hold of have to
[1:25:15] fall from their position as an accuser
[1:25:17] in the face of the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:25:21] to Paul this was a declaration
[1:25:24] imagine for Paul to write there is
[1:25:27] therefore now no condemnation meant
[1:25:29] something
[1:25:31] because Paul had reason to be condemned
[1:25:34] he had people probably that still
[1:25:36] condemned him because he he caused their
[1:25:38] sons and their daughters to be killed
[1:25:41] he went and did some things he shouldn't
[1:25:43] have done it is zealousness to try to go
[1:25:45] he said I did it in ignorance
[1:25:47] but this was a declaration it was a
[1:25:50] declaration he said there is therefore
[1:25:53] now no condemnation to Paul
[1:25:56] you're right that's right I hope you
[1:25:58] hear me today I wonder if we can put our
[1:26:00] name there there's no therefore now no
[1:26:02] condemnation to Ben through it
[1:26:06] who is in Christ Jesus
[1:26:08] who walks not after the flesh but after
[1:26:10] the spirit there is therefore now no
[1:26:12] condemnation to you
[1:26:13] whatever your name is it's a declaration
[1:26:15] I'm standing in my own defense Paul
[1:26:17] standing in his own defense and said I I
[1:26:19] read chapter seven he's saying what I
[1:26:22] would do I couldn't do and I was caught
[1:26:24] in this position he said oh Wretched Man
[1:26:26] that I am who will deliver me from the
[1:26:27] body of this death and he goes out and
[1:26:29] comedually says there's therefore now
[1:26:32] Hallelujah
[1:26:33] no condemnation he still had the battle
[1:26:36] he still fought those thoughts
[1:26:38] but he said I'm free he declared he
[1:26:41] stood up in his own defense and when you
[1:26:43] do Satan has to fall
[1:26:45] you can worship in Freedom
[1:26:48] amen
[1:26:49] should bow your heads with me for a
[1:26:50] moment
[1:26:51] why don't you declare it now
[1:26:54] I am redeemed
[1:26:57] there's no condemnation to me
[1:27:00] I'm gonna stand him on defense tonight
[1:27:02] not by my Merit but by the word of God
[1:27:06] not who I was
[1:27:08] foreign
[1:27:09] Something's Happened
[1:27:11] [Music]
[1:27:13] maybe there's formalism that's coming to
[1:27:15] worship maybe fear has hindered your
[1:27:16] worship
[1:27:19] oppression or something that comes in
[1:27:22] you feel like I'm just not worthy maybe
[1:27:23] condemnation
[1:27:25] why don't you believe the word tonight
[1:27:27] over your own symptoms
[1:27:29] you got to do that when you're sick why
[1:27:31] don't you do that for your salvation
[1:27:33] leave the word over your own symptoms I
[1:27:35] am redeemed there is therefore now no
[1:27:40] condemnation to me
[1:27:44] can you imagine the man who gets a
[1:27:45] pardon from the president he gets a
[1:27:47] pardon from the highest Authority in the
[1:27:49] land
[1:27:50] he may have been accused he may have
[1:27:53] done it
[1:27:54] but when he receives the pardon in the
[1:27:56] mailbox it's got the president's
[1:27:58] signature on it if he receives it he can
[1:28:01] walk away from that mailbox and say
[1:28:03] there is therefore now no verdict
[1:28:05] against me they tried me and found me
[1:28:08] guilty but they're so verdict the people
[1:28:11] tried me and found me guilty the devil
[1:28:13] tried me and found me guilty but there
[1:28:15] is therefore now no condemnation I hope
[1:28:18] we get a revelation of that tonight and
[1:28:20] begin to Worship in Freedom begin to
[1:28:22] realize God is still on the throne he's
