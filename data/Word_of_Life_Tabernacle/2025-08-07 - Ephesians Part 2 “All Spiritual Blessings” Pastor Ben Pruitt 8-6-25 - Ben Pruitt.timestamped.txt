[14:50] happy to be in church on a Wednesday
[14:51] night?
[14:52] &gt;&gt; It's sure good to see each and every one
[14:54] of you here this evening. Remember those
[14:55] that are out traveling for work and
[14:57] different things uh tonight. There's
[14:59] several out missing tonight. Just be
[15:01] praying for each need and and that the
[15:03] Lord will bring them back safely. Also,
[15:06] Brother Phil Allen, many of you may
[15:08] maybe know him here in the church. He
[15:10] run his thumb up through a saw yesterday
[15:12] and and uh took a big chunk out of the
[15:15] middle. I think it was. Brother Herald
[15:16] showed me the picture last night. And
[15:17] you don't want to see it. Um I think
[15:19] they said maybe something like 80
[15:21] stitches or something in his thumb. So
[15:23] uh just remember him in prayer. I'm sure
[15:25] I'm sure that's painful. So remember the
[15:27] feel in prayer that the Lord will help
[15:29] him to keep that thumb and and and heal
[15:31] his body. I don't have any other written
[15:34] requests tonight, but brother Danny,
[15:35] would you mind stepping up here and
[15:37] leading uh the church in prayer for
[15:39] these needs? If you have a need on your
[15:41] heart tonight, we would make it known by
[15:42] an uplifted hand. Man, God sees the
[15:44] need.
[15:47] Heavenly Father, we come before you
[15:49] tonight, Lord, at this part of the
[15:51] service. Father, the requests have been
[15:53] made known, Lord. We just ask you to go
[15:56] in a special way and be with our brother
[15:58] Phil tonight, Lord. His hand all chopped
[16:01] up, God. and in pain. No doubt we know.
[16:04] And we pray that you would just go and
[16:07] work in that situation, Lord. That they
[16:09] won't have to remove any of his fingers.
[16:11] Lord, just that God, that you just come
[16:14] in a mighty way and heal his body. Lord,
[16:16] we pray for everything that's every
[16:19] request that was made here tonight.
[16:21] Lord, we pray for each hand that was
[16:22] raised. Lord, you know what our needs
[16:24] are before we even ask. Father, we just
[16:28] ask you to come down in this service and
[16:30] be with Brother Ben as he brings the
[16:32] word tonight. Father, may you just open
[16:35] our minds of understanding. Lord, may we
[16:37] feed from it your fountain, Lord. And we
[16:41] pray that you bless this offering in
[16:43] your name we ask. Amen.

[26:41] And no one else can touch my heart like
[26:45] you do.
[26:48] And I can search for one. Turn it on.
[26:54] And I find there is none like you.
[27:01] Aren't you thankful for the Lord
[27:02] tonight? Amen. How many's ready for the
[27:05] word of the Lord this evening? I don't
[27:06] typically go fast, but we're going to
[27:08] change it up on the end here just a
[27:09] little bit. And I don't like to bring a
[27:11] pastor out on a fast song, but sometimes
[27:13] I just feel it's necessary to wake us up
[27:15] just a little. How many's been tired on
[27:17] a Wednesday evening and you need to be
[27:19] woke up a little bit? Well, then let's
[27:21] let's do it like this. You remember I
[27:23] sing because I'm happy. Have you ever
[27:24] played that? Well, my sorry I got I
[27:27] don't know that I've ever sang this with
[27:29] sister Anna, but we can all do it. It's

[27:33] fast as we can do it, we'll do it. Y'all

[27:42] I'm happy.
[27:44] Oh yes, I sing because I'm so free. Yes,
[27:50] I'm free. Oh, his eye is on the sparrow.
[27:58] And I know I know he watches over me.
[28:04] Oh, I sing because
[28:09] I'm happy.
[28:11] Oh, yes I see
[28:14] because I'm so free. Yes, I'm free. All
[28:19] his eye is on the spare
[28:25] and I know I know he watches.
[28:30] All sing with all your hearts now. Well,
[28:32] I sing
[28:34] because I'm so happy.
[28:39] Oh yes, I sing because I am free. Yes,

[28:58] now. Oh yes, I sing because
[29:03] I'm happy.
[29:06] Oh yes, I sing because I'm so free. Yes,
[29:12] I'm free. Well, his eye is on the
[29:17] sparrow
[29:20] and I know I know he watches one more
[29:24] time with all your hearts. Now, let me
[29:25] hear you sing it. Oh yes, I sing.
[29:31] I'm happy.
[29:33] Oh yes.
[29:50] He
[29:51] me
[29:56] because I'm happy.
[30:00] Oh yes I see.
[30:03] because
[30:05] I pray.
[30:07] Oh yes, his eyes
[30:10] on
[30:12] the spare
[30:15] and I know
[30:17] he watches
[30:19] me.
[30:22] Amen. Aren't you glad he watches over
[30:24] you? Amen. Amen. And he said, "If he
[30:28] cares for the little sparrow,"
[30:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "How much more are you
[30:34] worth than a bird?"
[30:38] Some of us might be bird brains, but
[30:40] we're still worth more to God than a
[30:43] bird. So thankful for that tonight. I
[30:46] thankful for his love and his care.
[30:49] Let's bow our heads together. Maybe
[30:50] you've got a
[30:52] a special need you'd like to make known,
[30:54] but we've uplifted a hand. I know God
[30:56] sees those needs tonight.
[30:59] Heavenly Father, we
[31:01] so appreciate your presence here with us
[31:04] and Lord, the joy that we feel in our
[31:06] hearts knowing that you are a God who
[31:09] cares and a God who looks out for us,
[31:12] Lord. So thankful as a brother was
[31:14] testifying to me of your protecting hand
[31:16] even today. Lord, I I thank you for
[31:19] that. I pray God that you'd continue to
[31:22] watch over each and every one that's
[31:24] here. for you to help us, Lord. Help our
[31:26] children, Lord, those that are watching.
[31:28] I pray you bless them as well, Lord. I I
[31:31] pray that you'd just open up your word
[31:33] to us tonight. Speak directly to our
[31:36] hearts, Lord. We don't want to just get
[31:38] it in our heads. We want our hearts to
[31:41] be in it. I pray that you'd make it so.
[31:44] We pray in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen. God
[31:50] bless you. Go right into the word.
[31:52] Ephesians chapter 1 verses 1 through3. I
[31:55] won't be here this weekend. Brother Joel
[31:57] will be here and and hopefully Brother
[31:58] Stewart if he makes it back from working
[32:00] out of state, but uh we'll uh they'll
[32:04] take care of you this weekend. But I'm
[32:06] going to go up to True Word Camp in
[32:08] Ohio. Um Peter and I think Emma's going
[32:12] with us as well. So we're going to go up
[32:13] there, me and Britney, and uh and
[32:17] hopefully have a good time in the Lord.
[32:19] and it's a long drive and a long long
[32:21] trip back. But uh just praying for the
[32:23] Lord's protection in that and uh they've
[32:26] asked me to do one of the afternoon
[32:28] sessions for the older young people and
[32:30] I realized what and asked me to do that.
[32:32] I'd never been that older young person.
[32:33] I was married so young and pastoring a
[32:36] church and doing those things. But but
[32:38] I'm looking forward to doing that for
[32:40] some of them some of them on Friday
[32:42] afternoons. You'd be praying for me.
[32:44] Ephesians chapter 1 and verse one.
[32:48] And then next weekend will be our
[32:49] banquet and brother Nathan Ericson will
[32:51] be here also on Sunday morning preaching
[32:54] that next weekend and I'm sure you'll
[32:55] enjoy that very very much. Paul an
[32:58] apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of
[33:01] God to the saints which are at Ephesus
[33:03] and to the faithful in Christ Jesus. Now
[33:06] who do we find out that is? That's us.
[33:10] The faithful in Christ Jesus. Grace be
[33:14] to you and peace from God our Father and
[33:18] from the Lord Jesus Christ. Blessed be
[33:22] the God and Father of our Lord Jesus
[33:24] Christ who hath blessed us with all
[33:28] spiritual blessings in heavenly places
[33:32] in Christ. We'll leave off reading
[33:33] there. Have your seats.
[33:38] Last week, we found Paul, the vindicated
[33:40] apostle and prophet of God, writing to
[33:44] those who are in Christ. That's us, in
[33:47] case we don't remember, by the baptism
[33:49] of the Holy Ghost. That's how we get
[33:51] into Christ is by being baptized by the
[33:54] Holy Ghost and fire and and and the
[33:57] literal life of Christ, coming back on
[33:59] the believer, anointing our faith, and
[34:02] allowing us to live a Christian life.
[34:04] And then we are in Christ. And when we
[34:06] are in Christ, we are found faithful in
[34:08] Christ because we are in him. And so
[34:11] Paul greets those peop that are in
[34:14] Christ. And he says, "Grace be to you
[34:16] and peace from God our father and from
[34:19] the Lord Jesus Christ." Now, a lot of
[34:22] times when you see that, you say, "Well,
[34:24] there's one person, God our Father, and
[34:27] another person, the Lord Jesus Christ."
[34:29] But we're taught that that's not the
[34:30] case. Uh because two people would have
[34:32] two opinions. And if you're a
[34:34] trinitarian, they teach that there are
[34:36] three people, three distinct persons in
[34:38] the godhead. And those would have three
[34:41] different opinions. And I don't know
[34:42] about you, it don't matter how much you
[34:44] agree with somebody, you're going to end
[34:45] up arguing with them at some point. If
[34:47] you're a distinct person, you're going
[34:49] to have some kind of a different idea.
[34:52] But God doesn't have any kind of a
[34:53] different idea because it's one God, one
[34:56] person who made himself the who made
[34:59] himself a father by making himself the
[35:03] son, right? And that that's hard for us
[35:05] to comprehend, but he's an
[35:07] incomprehensible God. So God is not
[35:10] diminished by separating the logos from
[35:13] that attribute of God. Brother Brandham
[35:15] said Jesus was that divine attribute of
[35:17] God called love. So God, he did not
[35:19] diminish the father to to cause the son
[35:22] to come to the earth and be born in the
[35:25] earth. So Jesus the son was the
[35:28] attribute not just an attribute of God
[35:30] but the attribute of the fullness of
[35:32] God. In Colossians 2 and verse 9 it says
[35:35] for in him dwelleth all. Someone say
[35:38] all. All the fullness of the godhead
[35:42] bodily. Word Godhead, don't let that
[35:44] stumble you. People take godhead and
[35:46] say, "Well, that means more than one, a
[35:47] godhead." That's not what that means at
[35:48] all. It literally means deity. In Christ
[35:51] dwells all the fullness of the deity
[35:55] bodily. Every every bit of God, right?
[35:58] There's no other God other than the
[36:01] other than Christ. And and so in him
[36:04] dwells all the fullness of the Godhead
[36:06] be bodily. He is not three persons. And
[36:08] brother Random also taught us he's not
[36:10] one like your finger. Right? Because the
[36:13] the uh United Pentecostal Church and
[36:15] some of those wonderful people, but they
[36:17] taught that he was one like your finger.
[36:19] And and from the beginning that Jesus
[36:21] that the the son was all that there was
[36:24] and and brother Brandham didn't teach us
[36:26] that. The Bible doesn't teach that. He
[36:28] could not be his own father. Right? So
[36:31] he had he the father manifested himself
[36:34] in the son. Brother Brandham says it
[36:35] this way. He was God manifested in a
[36:38] flesh of his creative son. I I think
[36:41] that we can all understand that tonight.
[36:43] He said God created the son. So he
[36:46] manifested himself and that was the
[36:48] fullness of godhead bodily. 1 Timothy
[36:51] 3:16 tells us without controversy. Great
[36:55] is the mystery of godliness. God was
[36:58] manifest in the flesh, justified in the
[37:01] spirit, seen of angels, preached into
[37:02] the Gentiles, believed on in the world,
[37:04] received up into glory. Who was
[37:06] manifested in the flesh? God was. How
[37:09] much of God? All of God,
[37:12] &gt;&gt; right? So all that was in Christ, right?
[37:15] All that was in God, he poured into
[37:16] Christ,
[37:18] &gt;&gt; right? All that was in Christ, he poured
[37:20] into the church. He he emptied himself.
[37:23] Brother Brandon says, I think the Greek
[37:24] word was kinosis. I believe he emptied
[37:27] himself from one form to another.
[37:29] Changed his mass to become the son so
[37:32] that we could be saved. Aren't you glad?
[37:33] To become a man so that we could be
[37:35] saved.
[37:36] &gt;&gt; So we're saved by the blood of God.
[37:40] Do you believe that's what the Bible
[37:41] says? Said we're saved by the blood of
[37:43] God, the created blood of God, which he
[37:46] created in the body of the son. So he
[37:49] says, "Grace to you and peace by God our
[37:51] father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
[37:52] Blessed be the God," verse three, "and
[37:55] father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath
[37:59] blessed us with all spiritual
[38:02] blessings." And that's what I want to
[38:03] kind of focus on tonight. He hath
[38:06] blessed us, past tense, with all
[38:09] spiritual blessings. Brother Brandham
[38:12] says, not just some to the apostles and
[38:14] some to this. In other words, he did not
[38:17] portion out his spiritual blessings, but
[38:19] to the ones who are in Christ. How many
[38:21] are in Christ tonight? I believe we can
[38:23] be proud of that. I'm in Christ. What
[38:25] does that mean? That I have been
[38:27] blessed. I have been blessed with all
[38:31] spiritual blessings. I'm not waiting to
[38:34] be blessed, but I have been blessed. In
[38:37] other words, they're there for me if I
[38:40] if I'll grab a hold of them and take
[38:41] advantage of them. So, those spiritual
[38:43] blessings are there. Brother Brandham
[38:45] said the same Holy Ghost that fell on
[38:47] the day of Pentecost is the same Holy
[38:50] Ghost here tonight.
[38:52] &gt;&gt; The same Holy Ghost. You say, "Well, if
[38:54] we just had the Holy Ghost like we did
[38:55] in Brother Brandham's time, how many
[38:56] Holy Ghost do you think there are?"
[38:59] &gt;&gt; Right? The same Holy Ghost that was here
[39:01] during Brother Brandham's time. The same
[39:02] Holy Ghost that's here during the
[39:04] meetings. The same Holy Ghost that's
[39:05] here at a youth camp or somewhere else
[39:07] that's here on a Wednesday night. And
[39:09] he's still the same God. The same
[39:11] yesterday, today in favor. All of God is
[39:14] the Holy Ghost. Are you with me now? He
[39:17] is here in the form of the Holy Ghost.
[39:19] And he's here in each one of us.
[39:21] &gt;&gt; So the same Holy Ghost that fell on the
[39:23] day of Pentecost is the same Holy Ghost
[39:24] here tonight. The same Holy Ghost that
[39:27] made Mary shout and speak with tongues
[39:29] and have a wonderful time and rejoice
[39:31] and the things that she did is the same
[39:33] Holy Ghost here tonight.
[39:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Then it ought to we ought to be
[39:38] able to have a wonderful time in the
[39:39] Lord. You say, "Brother Ben, you don't
[39:40] understand what I've been through." And
[39:42] I know sometimes people go through deep
[39:44] valleys and and troubles and things in
[39:47] their life. And I don't want to minimize
[39:48] that tonight, but we need to understand
[39:51] what we have and what we have access to
[39:54] by virtue of being in Christ. We are not
[39:56] only in Christ when we feel good. We are
[39:59] not only in Christ when we aren't being
[40:01] persecuted. We are not only in Christ
[40:03] when we're well, but when we're sick or
[40:05] being persecuted or facing trouble in
[40:07] our lives, we are still in Christ.
[40:09] Listen to me. You you seniors, you
[40:12] you're in Christ. Even if your body is
[40:14] failing you, you're still in Christ.
[40:16] Even if you have trouble in the in the
[40:18] flesh, you're still in Christ. You young
[40:20] people, you're still in Christ. If you
[40:22] make a mistake, you're still in Christ.
[40:24] Even though you might fall a hundred
[40:26] times, but if you've ever been in him,
[40:28] you're still in him.
[40:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I hope you get grab a hold
[40:32] of that tonight. We're not preaching
[40:34] fear. We're not preaching a a dogmatism.
[40:37] We're not here preaching if you if you
[40:38] cross the pastor, you're going to lose.
[40:40] Or if you cross the associate pastor or
[40:42] somebody else or if you if somebody's
[40:44] opinion about you changes that changes
[40:46] God's opinion. No, if you are ever in
[40:48] Christ, you are always in Christ.
[40:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm so glad for that cuz I
[40:55] don't always even have a good opinion
[40:56] about myself.
[40:59] &gt;&gt; I'd hate for my salvation to be subject
[41:01] to opinion,
[41:03] &gt;&gt; not even my own.
[41:05] &gt;&gt; So if you if Come on. That's why so many
[41:09] people are up and down and in and out
[41:10] all the time because their salvation is
[41:12] subject to their own opinion.
[41:18] &gt;&gt; I could stop and preach there for a
[41:20] while.
[41:21] &gt;&gt; I told myself I wasn't going to preach
[41:22] long cuz I got to leave about 5:00 in
[41:24] the morning, but I'm feeling good
[41:25] tonight. And I I just believe that that
[41:27] we shouldn't base our our our eternal
[41:29] salvation on what we think because we
[41:31] don't know everything. We don't see the
[41:33] whole plan of God. We don't see
[41:35] everything going on. We ought to submit
[41:37] ourselves to what God said. And God
[41:39] said, "I am blessed with every all
[41:41] spiritual blessings in Christ Jesus."
[41:45] &gt;&gt; That's what he has to say about it.
[41:48] &gt;&gt; What What are those spiritual blessings?
[41:49] We want to learn that tonight. And do
[41:51] they ever cease because we would want to
[41:53] know that if they ever stop coming to
[41:56] us. So what are spiritual blessings?
[41:58] That word blessing is a present in in
[42:00] one sense. There's two senses of the
[42:02] word. In one sense, it's a present. a
[42:04] present given as a sign of gracious
[42:07] kindness to promote the livelihood of
[42:09] the recipient especially with a giver
[42:12] characterized by joyful generosity. So
[42:15] it's a blessing a blessing. Another word
[42:19] another word for blessing or another
[42:21] sense of the same word is this this the
[42:24] act of of speech. It's it's speaking.
[42:27] That's what I was talking about the
[42:28] other day. That's Jason my nephew's
[42:31] favorite scripture. And I didn't know
[42:32] that when I when I said that, but he who
[42:35] blesses his neighbor early in the
[42:37] morning, it'll turn to a curse, you
[42:38] know, cuz he don't like his parents to
[42:40] wake him up. So,
[42:42] but uh but anyway, if I misqued that,
[42:45] you can tell me later.
[42:48] But but you know, if you to bless is to
[42:51] speak and so it's the act of praying for
[42:54] divine favor, especially the idea that
[42:56] even the the audience receives the
[42:58] benefit from the blessing. We say we
[43:00] bless our food, right? We we we do that.
[43:03] So, it's a blessing. It's a it's a it's
[43:05] a word. It's connected to something that
[43:07] you say. And so, uh it's used in 1 Peter
[43:11] chapter 3 and verse 8. Go ahead and turn
[43:12] there with me if you've got your Bibles
[43:14] tonight and and mark that scripture
[43:16] because it it kind of illustrates it
[43:18] very well. 1 Peter chapter 3 and verse
[43:20] 8. It says, "Finally, be ye all of one
[43:23] mind, having compassion one of another,
[43:26] love as brethren, be pitiful, be
[43:29] courteous." That's a almost that there's
[43:32] a lot right there we could just get
[43:33] into, but I don't have time tonight. Not
[43:35] rendering evil for evil or railing for
[43:38] railing, but contrary wise, blessing,
[43:42] right? So, this is speech,
[43:44] &gt;&gt; right? This is speech. This is the sense
[43:46] of blessing is speech. So when someone
[43:48] says something evil about you, bless
[43:50] them,
[43:52] &gt;&gt; right? Bless them where they can hear
[43:54] it. What do we say about blessing? If
[43:56] you if you bless the Lord in in your
[43:58] heart, that don't help nobody else,
[44:00] right? Nobody else. But to bless the
[44:02] Lord in the scriptural sense is to bless
[44:04] him with your lips to speak something.
[44:07] So if you speak, if someone speaks
[44:09] something publicly about you that's
[44:11] evil, speak something publicly about
[44:13] them that's good. Come on.
[44:16] &gt;&gt; Well, that's hard to do, but that's what
[44:18] we ought to do. Knowing that you are
[44:20] there unto called that you should
[44:24] inherit a blessing. Now, that's the
[44:26] other sense of the word. So, the first
[44:29] sense of the word is a blessing of
[44:32] speech. The second sense of the word is
[44:35] a gift, a present.
[44:37] So, if you bless with your lips, he's
[44:40] saying you will inherit a blessing. I
[44:43] believe the same thing is true of
[44:44] church. If you'll come to church and
[44:46] bless the Lord, you'll receive a
[44:49] blessing,
[44:50] &gt;&gt; right? And so we can see that now verse
[44:53] three again, he said he has blessed us
[44:55] with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
[44:59] places in Christ. He is he said so what
[45:01] is he saying? Blessed be the God and
[45:04] father. So Paul is blessing God for
[45:07] blessing us.
[45:09] So, I know a lot of people are waiting
[45:11] to say, "Well, when he blesses me, then
[45:14] I will bless him." But Paul is setting
[45:16] the people. Remember what he's doing in
[45:18] the book of Ephesians? He's setting them
[45:20] in their position in the land. So, he's
[45:22] telling them, "This is where you are.
[45:25] This is what belongs to you, right? This
[45:28] is he's he's giving you uh your
[45:31] geography lesson. This is where you are.
[45:33] This is who you are. This is what your
[45:35] land is, what your promise is." And so
[45:38] he blesses the Lord for blessings that
[45:41] have already been given by the Lord.
[45:45] &gt;&gt; Right? The first sense of blessing in
[45:47] the first word, the second sense of
[45:49] blessing in spiritual blessings. So he
[45:51] or he has blessed us with spiritual
[45:53] blessings. So now uh he we bless him
[45:56] because he hath past tense blessed us.
[46:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I wish I could just repeat
[46:03] that and and and just let let it sit
[46:05] right there. and then you come explain
[46:07] to me next sun next Wednesday night and
[46:09] we'll see how that goes because I really
[46:11] believe that we don't understand that
[46:14] &gt;&gt; we don't understand how much we've
[46:15] already been blessed or we would bless
[46:18] the Lord more.
[46:20] &gt;&gt; But see, we're waiting because we got
[46:21] prayers that we think are unanswered and
[46:23] think God heard your prayer. Listen, he
[46:26] he already knows all about it. He's
[46:27] going to take care of it. But we think
[46:29] things are unanswered and we think
[46:31] things haven't come to pass and we think
[46:33] things aren't working out like they
[46:34] should. So, we withhold our blessing of
[46:36] God, waiting on a better time. But
[46:39] listen, there is no better time than
[46:40] right now to bless God for the things
[46:43] that he's given us. How many believe
[46:44] that tonight?
[46:46] &gt;&gt; Bless him. Blessed be the God and father
[46:49] of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed
[46:51] us with all spiritual blessings. In
[46:54] other words, before we could ever bless
[46:56] his name, he blessed us with all
[46:58] spiritual blessings. to quote brother
[47:01] Windle from two years ago at the that's
[47:03] pretty good if you can remember a sermon
[47:04] for two years but brother Brandon
[47:06] preached or brother Windle rather
[47:07] preached a sermon to us titled we are
[47:09] blessed you are blessed remember that
[47:11] actually from just over a year ago and
[47:14] and and when he did that what was he
[47:16] telling us we've been blessed with
[47:18] spiritual blessings because some of us
[47:21] could say we are naturally blessed and
[47:23] others could say we are not
[47:26] &gt;&gt; right I
[47:29] today I I I was listening to a preacher,
[47:32] not a message preacher, but it was just
[47:33] a preacher that I happened to run across
[47:35] and he was talking about this preacher.
[47:37] You know, we we talk about people that
[47:38] have been blessed with good looks. Well,
[47:41] that could be a blessing or a curse.
[47:43] We've not all been blessed in that way.
[47:46] He was talking about this preacher. He
[47:47] said he was so ugly. See, just
[47:49] tremendously ugly. He said, "But he was
[47:51] such a good preacher that he almost
[47:53] looked good by the time he got done
[47:55] preaching.
[47:59] So that's that's pretty bad right there.
[48:03] Some people just aren't blessed with
[48:04] natural good looks. Ask me how I know.
[48:08] But we are all are all blessed with all
[48:11] spiritual blessings. That's why he puts
[48:13] the word spiritual blessings because in
[48:16] in the natural we are blessed. We're
[48:19] blessed by the sunlight. We're blessed
[48:20] by the uh by the weather. We're blessed
[48:23] by uh financially in different ways. But
[48:26] we're all blessed on different levels.
[48:28] But when it comes to spiritual
[48:29] blessings, all of the spiritual
[48:31] blessings are laying there for us
[48:35] &gt;&gt; to be blessed by.
[48:36] &gt;&gt; Now look, we've been he has blessed us
[48:39] with those. He's, in other words, he's
[48:41] given the gift. We just have to learn
[48:44] how to take it.
[48:45] &gt;&gt; So, we are blessed. Now, I wonder if we
[48:48] recognize that blessing. And and that's
[48:49] what really this teaching tonight is all
[48:51] about. You know, when we're looking a at
[48:54] the things of God, we've got to quit
[48:56] looking carnally at the things of God
[48:58] and letting our spiritual experience be
[49:01] tied to our natural experience. But
[49:04] we've got to understand that those two
[49:05] things may be completely different. Look
[49:08] at Paul and Silas in the in the jail
[49:10] with with rats running across their feet
[49:12] and stripes across their back, but they
[49:14] were still blessed with all spiritual
[49:16] blessings in Christ Jesus. Paul writes
[49:18] this from a prison and it wasn't a good
[49:22] prison. It wasn't the kind of prison
[49:24] they send people to today. It wasn't
[49:26] even as good as your local county jail,
[49:28] but it was a prison full of rats and
[49:31] full of filth and full of darkness. And
[49:34] yet he writes to the people at the
[49:36] Ephesians and he said, "We have been
[49:38] blessed."
[49:39] &gt;&gt; So I believe we could all say that
[49:41] tonight. I know we can if we are in
[49:43] Christ. Yeah.
[49:45] &gt;&gt; So, but but brother Brandham, you know,
[49:47] he talked about how that churches could
[49:50] get to a place, and I think this
[49:52] instructive for us as individuals as
[49:54] well, that they could get to a place
[49:56] that they they just don't receive
[49:58] blessings anymore.
[50:00] &gt;&gt; They're too set in their ways
[50:02] &gt;&gt; to receive blessings.
[50:04] &gt;&gt; So, Brother Brandham is hunting on a
[50:07] hunting trip and he's hunting a grizzly
[50:08] bear. If you ever find me hunting a
[50:10] grizzly bear, remember I've gone
[50:13] completely nuts.
[50:16] If I'm ever in the grizzly bear woods,
[50:18] I'm sure the grizzly bear is hunting me.
[50:22] But brother Brandon was hunting the
[50:23] grizzly bear. And and when he hunted the
[50:26] grizzly, he he come to this place. It
[50:29] was night time and the moon was out and
[50:31] the wind was blowing. And he comes into
[50:33] this place that's been burned over. You
[50:35] remember the story? And and in this
[50:37] place, there's a bunch of Paul what has
[50:40] been trees, but they're dead, right? And
[50:44] they're just the the uh the stump or the
[50:47] trunk of a tree with no limbs left on
[50:50] it, no no leaves or no pine needles left
[50:52] on it, the big great pine trees, and
[50:54] they're just there, but they've been
[50:56] burned over. And so when he come into
[50:58] that place, he said it was a spooky kind
[51:00] of place that had been burned over. And
[51:04] so he got to looking at it. He said,
[51:05] "Well, that's just like Joel where it
[51:07] says that what what the palm worm left,
[51:10] the cankerworm ate, what the canworm
[51:12] left, the caterpillar ate." He said,
[51:13] "That's just like that." And so he began
[51:15] thinking about that. And he said, "But
[51:17] it was a very spooky kind of a place."
[51:19] He said it was just like a great big
[51:21] bunch of churches, great big spires
[51:24] sticking up like that. Just look like a
[51:26] big bunch of tombstones. He said, "Walk
[51:29] into the place and the spiritual
[51:31] thermometer a thousand below zero.
[51:35] walk in there and somebody say, "Amen."
[51:37] They'd turn around and the pastor get a
[51:39] deacon and take them outside the door.
[51:43] &gt;&gt; So, he's describing what this was like
[51:46] being in a burnover condition. Churches
[51:49] get in this condition sometimes, but
[51:51] sometimes individuals do as well when
[51:54] they don't when they cannot receive a
[51:55] blessing and you watch them sit in the
[51:57] house of God when God's even moving and
[51:59] the presence of God is there, but the
[52:01] person is so burned over by the fire of
[52:03] the enemy that he can't even receive it.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; And many times that kind of person,
[52:10] well, we'll blame the church or blame
[52:11] the pastor or blame the community or
[52:13] blame the message or blame somebody else
[52:16] or blame your neighbor. But really the
[52:18] problem is you you just got burnt over.
[52:20] You're in a condition where you can't
[52:22] receive.
[52:24] &gt;&gt; But he said he thought of the scripture
[52:25] and he said Job said I will restore
[52:27] sayaeth the Lord.
[52:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said why
[52:33] they say you interrupt me when you're
[52:34] hollering. Amen. He said well you
[52:36] interrupt me when you don't holler.
[52:37] Amen.
[52:40] There is nothing more disruptive to a
[52:42] service
[52:44] &gt;&gt; than a bunch of people that will not
[52:46] move.
[52:49] &gt;&gt; Do you know that? Well, I'm afraid I'll
[52:51] disrupt the service if I say something.
[52:53] There is nothing more disruptive than a
[52:55] bunch of people that just sit there and
[52:56] look at you. And I'm not I know we got
[52:58] all kinds of different personalities and
[53:00] things. And the other day Joel got on to
[53:02] me. He said, "You didn't back me very
[53:03] good." Well, I had strep. So, or I had
[53:06] had it that week. I had a reason. But,
[53:08] you know, we're not all we're not all
[53:10] going to shout all the time or but but
[53:13] there's got to be something. I mean, at
[53:14] least at least nod at me once in a
[53:17] while, you know, and it'd be all right.
[53:19] And if you can't nod, smile,
[53:25] &gt;&gt; but we don't want to be mournful,
[53:29] &gt;&gt; right?
[53:30] &gt;&gt; And and brother Brandon said they the
[53:32] the Methodists and the Baptists all
[53:34] together were they were big churches one
[53:35] time. And he said just like these trees
[53:37] were real trees.
[53:40] But he said he he said I said what makes
[53:42] the wind make them so mournful. He said
[53:46] well I happen to think that they're
[53:47] coming one day suddenly from heaven like
[53:49] a rushing mighty wind filled all the
[53:51] house where they were sitting. And I
[53:52] thought that's right. God can send out
[53:54] an oldtime Pentecostal revival and all
[53:58] the churches do is just mourn.
[54:01] &gt;&gt; Come on
[54:01] &gt;&gt; when it hits them.
[54:04] He said, "They're stiff. They're dead.
[54:07] They can't move." And I'm not talking
[54:08] about us. Everybody else, right?
[54:14] They they're stiff. They're dead. They
[54:16] can't move. They go, "There's no such
[54:19] thing as divine healing.
[54:21] Divine healing is gone. The days of
[54:23] miracles has passed. There's no such
[54:25] thing as the gifts of the spirit. Just
[54:27] pouring of the Holy Ghost." He said,
[54:28] just moving right through their members.
[54:31] They say, "Oh, don't believe that.
[54:32] That's fanaticism. We are churches. Look
[54:35] at here we are. We got a ritual. We're
[54:37] recorded. Oh yes, but brother dead.
[54:41] &gt;&gt; Come on. He said, "The devil's fire is
[54:43] done burned all the sap bark off of you.
[54:45] You ain't got no life left. Just a big
[54:48] bunch of ritualistic tombstones." He
[54:50] said, "Only thing you can do is moan and
[54:52] cry and go on." And God sending the
[54:54] revival just the same. He said, "Then I
[54:56] saw over in the second chapter of Joel
[54:58] where it said, I will restore, sayeth
[55:00] the Lord." Oh, church. Then I thought,
[55:03] what could you restore, God? There's not
[55:04] even any life in the thing. How could
[55:06] you ever put anything in that old dead
[55:08] thing standing there? An old stump and
[55:09] the moon shining on it, it moaning and
[55:11] groaning. It can't give. It ain't got no
[55:13] life in it. It just stands there and the
[55:15] wind comes and goes. Woo! Woo! I thought
[55:18] you can't make that thing move, Lord,
[55:19] because it ain't got any substance. It
[55:21] ain't got no life about it. It's all
[55:23] dried up and gone.
[55:25] &gt;&gt; Oh my. I don't want that to be us. I
[55:27] don't want that to be this church. Come
[55:29] on.
[55:29] &gt;&gt; But what we're looking for is some new
[55:31] growth.
[55:32] &gt;&gt; That don't have to be new people. That
[55:34] could be the growth of the word in your
[55:36] life instead of the growth of doubt. The
[55:37] growth of faith in your life instead of
[55:39] the growth of fear.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[55:43] &gt;&gt; He said you the cold formal churches,
[55:46] you can't do it. He said first place
[55:47] they won't let you in the pulpit to
[55:48] preach this kind of a gospel. That's
[55:50] right. Oh, he said that guy. So they
[55:52] can't be
[55:54] Come on. He said they can't be they
[55:56] can't be restored because they won't
[55:58] hear the gospel
[55:59] &gt;&gt; right
[56:00] &gt;&gt; preached. Oh, but if we will hear the
[56:03] gospel, if we can hear the gospel, we
[56:06] can be restored. We can be revived no
[56:08] matter what condition that we're in.
[56:12] He said, "They won't let you in the
[56:13] pulpit." He said, "Oh, that guyy's a
[56:14] holy roller. I don't want nothing to do
[56:16] with him." That's right. Their members
[56:17] would bring you in. All right, but I'll
[56:18] have to consult the board and the
[56:20] deacons. He said, "So the people want
[56:21] it, but the board and the deacons." And
[56:23] he said, "Want to go through that?" No,
[56:24] no, no. Right down the road. He said,
[56:26] "Don't tell me. I've been along the
[56:27] road." He said, "That's right." "Oh,
[56:29] well, you're good people, but oh, none
[56:30] of that in our church. It would just
[56:32] tear our church to pieces." And Brother
[56:34] Brand was telling us a story about an
[56:35] old black man that said this. He said,
[56:37] "You show me the church that ever died
[56:39] under spiritual blessings."
[56:41] He said, "I'll climb up this great spire
[56:43] and lay my hands on its big tower and
[56:45] say, blessed are the dead that died in
[56:47] the Lord."
[56:50] Because if you can die from God blessing
[56:52] you, you're better off dead. Come on.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, but I want the blessings of God. I
[56:56] need the blessings of God.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; I believe we all do.
[57:01] &gt;&gt; He said directly I heard something going
[57:03] and I don't know what this sound really
[57:04] is, but he said frolic. Frolic frolic.
[57:09] So something sounded like it was playful
[57:13] frolicking. I thought, "What is it?" And
[57:16] some undergrowth was coming up.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; Little bitty trees just like it.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; They were trees just like the big ones
[57:22] were trees. But what was it? They had
[57:25] received spiritual blessings,
[57:28] &gt;&gt; right? I said, "There you are, Lord. I
[57:30] will restore, sayeth the Lord, right in
[57:31] the same forest. Come up an
[57:33] undergrowth." What they call backwash
[57:34] today. What they call fanaticism today.
[57:37] And I said, "Look at the difference.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; When the wind hits these here, them big,
[57:41] tall, mournful trees, they say, but when
[57:45] it hits them little green trees that's
[57:46] got life in it, it just frolicss and
[57:49] jumps and up and down. Oldfashioned Holy
[57:51] Ghost revival. I will restore, sayeth
[57:54] the Lord. I will restore. You say, got a
[57:56] lot of life in them. When the wind
[57:57] blows, they just jolly with it.
[58:00] &gt;&gt; I like that. I don't care what the
[58:01] people says. That don't make any
[58:03] difference. I just frolic with the Holy
[58:05] Ghost then. Every way it blows, I just
[58:07] blow with it. Loving everybody, having a
[58:10] wonderful time. Isn't that what you want
[58:11] to be? Lord, let me be flexible. Let me
[58:13] be some of that undergrowth that's
[58:15] coming up. It may not look like much. It
[58:17] may be green, but let me be flexible to
[58:19] the wind of the Holy Ghost.
[58:22] Amen. What is it? Spiritual blessings.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; We know that these spiritual blessings
[58:29] fall on the just and the unjust.
[58:32] Do you know that you don't have to be
[58:34] even saved to feel the effect of
[58:38] spiritual blessings?
[58:41] &gt;&gt; But we're going to show you and I'll
[58:42] show you after a while what it means to
[58:43] be in Christ when it comes to spiritual
[58:46] blessings. Matthew chapter 5 and verse
[58:48] 44, Jesus said, "I say unto you, love
[58:50] your enemies. Bless them that curse you,
[58:53] good to them that hate you. Pray for
[58:54] them which despitefully use you and
[58:56] persecute you, that you may be the
[58:58] children of your father which is in
[59:00] heaven. For he maketh his son to rise on
[59:02] the evil and on the good, and sendeth
[59:04] rain on the just and the unjust."
[59:08] &gt;&gt; So he's telling us how we should treat
[59:10] people.
[59:12] &gt;&gt; Because he don't treat them any
[59:13] different.
[59:13] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; Right. You could have a neighbor that
[59:18] just the most vile, awful, mean person
[59:22] that you've ever met. Smokes like a like
[59:26] a furnace, drinks like a fish,
[59:31] just the worst person, commits adultery,
[59:33] carries on all hours of the night,
[59:36] and you both go to bed tonight. And when
[59:39] you wake up in the morning, God don't
[59:41] make the sun not rise on that person's
[59:43] house. If he's got vegetables in his
[59:46] garden, they grow just like the
[59:48] vegetables in your garden. He may go to
[59:50] his job and get a raise.
[59:53] &gt;&gt; He may be blessed financially. He may be
[59:55] blessed in all other ways. He may I've
[59:57] known people who smoked and drank all
[59:59] their life and those things destroy your
[1:00:01] health. But I've known some people just
[1:00:02] blessed with good health. They smoked
[1:00:04] all their life. George Burns was a
[1:00:06] comedian and he he didn't live a good
[1:00:08] life at all. But he smoked cigars I
[1:00:10] think till he was 90s something years
[1:00:11] old and and lived almost I think a
[1:00:13] hundred years old. Smoked like multiple
[1:00:16] cigars every day. I can't explain that.
[1:00:18] The blessings fall on the just and the
[1:00:20] unjust.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; That don't mean you could get away with
[1:00:23] it.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; Or I could get away with it.
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; Right? But the blessings the sun and the
[1:00:29] rain are natural blessings that fall on
[1:00:31] the just and the unjust. The same is
[1:00:32] true of spiritual blessings.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; Right? If a person will be flexible and
[1:00:36] receive, they can receive spiritual
[1:00:38] blessings. Some people not even saved.
[1:00:40] In 1 Corinthians 10:1, Paul talks about
[1:00:42] how the children of Israel, I'm trying
[1:00:43] to hurry here to get through, but Paul
[1:00:45] talks about how the children of Israel
[1:00:47] all come through uh the the cloud. And
[1:00:50] he said, all passed through the sea. And
[1:00:52] verse two, we're all baptized to Moses
[1:00:54] in the cloud in the sea. And all eat the
[1:00:56] same spiritual meat and drank the same
[1:00:58] spiritual drink and drank of the
[1:01:00] spiritual rock that followed them. And
[1:01:01] that rock was Christ. But with many of
[1:01:04] them God was not well pleased for they
[1:01:05] were overthrown in the wilderness. But
[1:01:07] the Bible said they all come out by the
[1:01:08] same pastor. They all was baptized into
[1:01:11] the sea. They all eat of that spiritual
[1:01:13] mana. And the mana was Christ. Christ
[1:01:16] coming down. The mana come down every
[1:01:18] night from heaven and perish here to
[1:01:20] sustain the people in their journey. And
[1:01:22] Christ come from heaven and gave his
[1:01:24] life. Whosoever believeth on him should
[1:01:26] not perish but have everlasting life. He
[1:01:27] said, "Christ come down to become our
[1:01:29] mana to eat of these same spiritual
[1:01:32] blessings."
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; Therefore, the Holy Spirit can fall
[1:01:35] right in amongst the people. And both
[1:01:37] Christian and lukewarm, halfbelievers
[1:01:40] and borderline believers will all eat
[1:01:44] the same,
[1:01:46] right? And that's why you can see people
[1:01:48] get blessed,
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; right? Two people get blessed. Two
[1:01:51] people come to the altar. Two people
[1:01:53] shout. Two people run. Two people uh
[1:01:56] worship in the church.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; One of them live like the devil,
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; right? One of them be a real Christian,
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; right? Because the blessings fall on the
[1:02:05] just and the unjust.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; He he said he he said, "I I wish I had
[1:02:09] words." He said that I could drive this
[1:02:11] down and cinch it in the heart of every
[1:02:13] person here and see what a deep thing
[1:02:15] this is. It isn't something to be played
[1:02:17] with. It isn't just going to church. Or
[1:02:20] you say, "I know I'm saved. Hallelujah.
[1:02:21] I shouted in the spirit. I feel this."
[1:02:23] That doesn't have one thing to do with
[1:02:24] it. You see how we base our eternal
[1:02:26] destination upon a sensation. Or say, "I
[1:02:29] know I got it because I felt the power
[1:02:30] go through me. I did this." That might
[1:02:32] be all exactly the truth. And you're
[1:02:33] still lost. And remember Paul when he
[1:02:35] gets into Ephesians, he tells them,
[1:02:37] you're blessed with all spiritual
[1:02:38] blessings, but he doesn't base their
[1:02:40] salvation on their spiritual blessings,
[1:02:43] but he takes them back to the mind of
[1:02:45] God and said, "You were chosen in him."
[1:02:47] before the foundation of the world.
[1:02:49] That's why you're able to be saved.
[1:02:51] That's why you're able to be redeemed.
[1:02:52] Are you with me now?
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; And the only way you can tell if that's
[1:02:57] taking place is what kind of fruits that
[1:02:59] you're bearing. Whether your life agrees
[1:03:02] with the word, right? And whether you
[1:03:04] say amen to the word, as brother Brand
[1:03:06] puts it in one place, or whether you
[1:03:07] believe the word of your hour as he says
[1:03:09] in other places,
[1:03:11] right? That's how you know.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? Because if you
[1:03:16] believe it, you receive it and you'll
[1:03:19] and and and you'll act like it.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; You'll bear that fruit. So Paul puts it
[1:03:24] this way. Though I speak with the
[1:03:26] tongues of men and angels, have not
[1:03:28] charity, I'm become a sounding brass or
[1:03:30] tinkling symbols. So he's saying, in
[1:03:31] other words, I can have all spiritual
[1:03:33] blessings
[1:03:35] and still be nothing.
[1:03:37] Now all living things have sensation.
[1:03:41] That's what they tell me. That's why uh
[1:03:43] some people won't even eat vegetables
[1:03:44] hardly. You know, they say they feel
[1:03:47] pain. But anything that's living can
[1:03:49] have a sensation. An animal even can
[1:03:52] feel a certain amount of sensation. A
[1:03:53] human being, any human being can feel a
[1:03:56] sensation if they would if if they would
[1:03:59] not be hardened by sin. They can feel
[1:04:01] the presence of the Lord. That's
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; right. They can know that he's there.
[1:04:07] But it's the manifested fruit that tells
[1:04:10] you what life is in the seed. So when
[1:04:13] the rain falls, it falls on the wheat
[1:04:15] and it falls on the tears. And then when
[1:04:18] it comes up, you begin to see what it
[1:04:20] is, right? So the wheat and the tears
[1:04:23] both benefit from the same spiritual
[1:04:25] blessings, but when they come up, then
[1:04:29] they have two different purposes and are
[1:04:31] two different seeds. So brother Brandham
[1:04:34] comments on this scripture, Ephesians
[1:04:35] 1:3. He said, 'You know, it don't take a
[1:04:37] lot of hollering. It don't take a lot of
[1:04:39] screaming. That's all right. Nothing
[1:04:41] against it. Now, now we're Are you okay
[1:04:44] with this? We're balancing this in such
[1:04:46] a way. And I want to get you to
[1:04:47] something in a moment. He said, "That's
[1:04:49] all right. Nothing against it. It's all
[1:04:50] right. It don't take that. It takes a
[1:04:51] submitted heart." Amen. Sitting in
[1:04:55] heavenly places, feasting on the things
[1:04:56] of the spirit.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; What does the spirit feast on? Emotion.
[1:05:00] Not allto together. He said it brings
[1:05:03] emotion. Yeah.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; He said, "But you remember the vision
[1:05:06] about the rain and the wheat, the tears.
[1:05:07] Remember when needing rain, there's a
[1:05:08] little cocker bearer. He's got his head
[1:05:10] hanging down. The wheat's got his head
[1:05:11] hanging down. When the rain come, both
[1:05:13] of them jump up and shout, "Same rain.
[1:05:15] But by their fruit, you shall know
[1:05:16] them."
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; Now I I tell you what, if you're in the
[1:05:21] field receiving rain, you got spiritual
[1:05:23] blessings.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; So I want spiritual blessings. I don't
[1:05:27] want to be an old dead, mournful tree
[1:05:28] that can't receive. I want spiritual
[1:05:30] blessings. Yes, the wheat will receive
[1:05:32] it and the tear will receive it, but
[1:05:34] Lord, let me have mine cuz I believe
[1:05:36] that I'm the predestined of God. I
[1:05:38] believe I've been filled with the Holy
[1:05:39] Ghost. I believe I'm the real thing,
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; right? And you've got to believe that or
[1:05:43] you'll never make it.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? The devil's going to
[1:05:48] try to talk you out the rest of your
[1:05:49] life. He's going to try to talk you out
[1:05:51] of being a Christian.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I just got saved and the
[1:05:54] devil's really after me trying to make
[1:05:55] me think I'm not a Christian." Well,
[1:05:57] that's his job. He wakes up and clocks
[1:05:59] in just to do that.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; I'm old enough to remember Peter when
[1:06:04] they had clockins that they had a punch
[1:06:07] card and you punched in. You know when
[1:06:09] you went to work when I first started
[1:06:10] going to work and I punched in and some
[1:06:12] places may still do that and and you put
[1:06:14] your card in there and it punched it for
[1:06:16] that day and you had to be careful not
[1:06:17] to get it messed up because they
[1:06:19] wouldn't fix it. So you just didn't work
[1:06:21] that day if you forgot.
[1:06:23] But we uh you know I uh the devil gets
[1:06:27] up in the morning. He punches in. Almost
[1:06:28] lost my train of thought there.
[1:06:31] The devil gets up in the morning and he
[1:06:33] and and he punches in and what does he
[1:06:35] do? He says, "I'm going to go bother
[1:06:36] brother Ben." He don't call me brother.
[1:06:41] I hope not.
[1:06:45] Devil gets up and says, "I'm gonna go
[1:06:46] bother Harvey today." You know, if he
[1:06:49] can't get to you, he sends a a little
[1:06:51] little demon down your way. You know,
[1:06:53] he's got lots of those, huh? Maybe send
[1:06:56] that neighbor we were talking about, you
[1:06:58] know, send him by your way. Well, that's
[1:07:01] his job.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; You can't blame the man for doing his
[1:07:04] job. But our job is to give it back to
[1:07:07] him. We know where we stand. Like, you
[1:07:10] can't tell me I I didn't go. I wasn't
[1:07:12] there. I I haven't experienced it. I I'm
[1:07:14] not part of him. Because I know that's
[1:07:17] that's me. I've seen myself in the
[1:07:19] mirror and I've said, "That's me.
[1:07:22] Amen. Are you with me now?
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; I've seen myself in the mirror of the
[1:07:25] word. So the devil can't do anything to
[1:07:27] us that we don't allow him to do. But
[1:07:30] why don't we have more spiritual
[1:07:31] blessings? Brother Brandham says, I'm
[1:07:33] glad you asked. The reason we don't have
[1:07:35] the spiritual blessings. We have too
[1:07:37] much time to watch television,
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; too much time to read the newspapers.
[1:07:42] Everybody say, "Well, kick the
[1:07:43] television out." Well, maybe you might
[1:07:44] need the newspapers. And now you read
[1:07:47] them on these,
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; right? I'm using one to preach from. So
[1:07:51] it's not the device,
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; but what are you doing with it?
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; He said, "Too much time to read the
[1:07:58] newspapers or listen to something we
[1:07:59] ought not be listening to." And we are
[1:08:02] not redeeming the time, but we're giving
[1:08:03] it to the things of the world instead of
[1:08:05] our time to the Lord Jesus. So if you
[1:08:08] want spiritual blessings, you got to
[1:08:10] give him time to get to open those up to
[1:08:13] you. The spiritual blessing is the work
[1:08:15] of the Holy Spirit. Brother Brandon say
[1:08:17] he blesses us with what? Divine healing.
[1:08:19] How many you need healing tonight? If
[1:08:21] you need healing in your body, he has
[1:08:23] blessed you with that. He has blessed
[1:08:25] you with that.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me tonight?
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; That's what brother Brandham tells us
[1:08:30] these spiritual blessings are. Divine
[1:08:32] healing, fornowledge, revelation,
[1:08:35] visions, powers, tongues,
[1:08:36] interpretations, wisdom, knowledge, all
[1:08:39] the heavenly blessings, joy unspeakable,
[1:08:41] full of glory, every heart filled with
[1:08:43] the same spirit. Walking together,
[1:08:45] sitting together in heavenly places, not
[1:08:47] one evil thought among us, not one
[1:08:48] cigarette smoke, not one short dress,
[1:08:50] not one this, that, or the other, not
[1:08:52] one evil thought. Nobody got anything
[1:08:54] against one another.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; Wow, what a church.
[1:08:59] But what he's saying is is that's what
[1:09:01] he wants us to be.
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; He don't want us to be one in and one
[1:09:05] out and this one doing good today and
[1:09:06] that one doing good tomorrow and this
[1:09:07] one doing bad. No, he wants us to all
[1:09:09] come together in one accord in one place
[1:09:11] and recognize no matter what's going on
[1:09:13] on the outside. We belong to him. We are
[1:09:16] in Christ.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:09:19] He said everybody speaking in love and
[1:09:21] harmony, everybody with one accord in
[1:09:23] one place and suddenly there come from
[1:09:25] heaven a sound like a rushing mighty
[1:09:26] wind. He said there you are. He has
[1:09:29] blessed us with all. Someone say it
[1:09:30] again all spiritual blessings.
[1:09:34] But then we look at that and and you
[1:09:35] say, "Well, brother Ben, what you just
[1:09:37] said, it falls on the just and the
[1:09:38] unjust. So maybe I ought to just leave
[1:09:40] it alone." And some folks become afraid
[1:09:42] of spiritual blessings because they
[1:09:44] might be deceived.
[1:09:46] But the question is, are you in Christ
[1:09:49] or not?
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; This is powerful. Brother B says, "When
[1:09:58] we are in Christ, we have spiritual
[1:10:02] blessing."
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; Did you need healing tonight? When we
[1:10:09] are in Christ, we have healing.
[1:10:12] When we are in Christ, we have
[1:10:14] salvation.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; When we are in Christ, we have we have
[1:10:18] all the gifts of the spirit.
[1:10:21] Right?
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; Listen what brother Brandon said.
[1:10:23] Outside of Christ, we have sensations.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; The same spiritual blessing will fall,
[1:10:32] but all we get out of it is a sensation.
[1:10:37] This is where so many people and I and
[1:10:39] working with young people sometimes I'll
[1:10:41] go to different churches and places and
[1:10:42] I have people come and it breaks my
[1:10:44] heart because I I get young people
[1:10:46] feeling like well I didn't receive a
[1:10:47] great emotional experience so I must not
[1:10:49] have it. Are you in Christ?
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; Are you in Christ? And so much of it is
[1:10:56] this idea of I'll have them come talk to
[1:10:57] me and they'll say, "Well, brother Ben,
[1:10:59] pray for me. I don't know what I did to
[1:11:01] cause this problem." If I've heard that
[1:11:04] once, I've heard it a thousand times.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; Well, what did Job do to cause his
[1:11:08] problem?
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; God recommended him for a trial.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; They'll say, "Well, I must not be doing.
[1:11:16] Brother Ben, tell me what I'm doing
[1:11:18] that's wrong because my loved ones
[1:11:20] aren't saved and my body's not healed
[1:11:21] and I went through the prayer line. I
[1:11:23] didn't feel nothing." Well, it's not
[1:11:24] about what you feel, but it's about
[1:11:26] what's on the inside of you. Are you in
[1:11:28] Christ? If you're in Christ, you receive
[1:11:30] spiritual blessings from Christ. But you
[1:11:33] got to be flexible to receive those. If
[1:11:36] you're in Christ and you're flexible to
[1:11:38] receive, you have all spiritual
[1:11:41] blessings. Oh, church, I say we ought to
[1:11:43] just pray, Lord, make me flexible to
[1:11:45] receive the wind of the Holy Spirit. Let
[1:11:47] me let me be able to bow down when the
[1:11:49] wind comes by my way.
[1:11:54] Outside of Christ, we have sensations,
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; but in Christ, we have positive
[1:12:02] blessing.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; Are you in Christ?
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; Right? That's who this is addressed to.
[1:12:10] Those who are in Christ Jesus, I believe
[1:12:12] our young people can be in Christ Jesus.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; I believe our elders can be in Christ
[1:12:17] Jesus. That's where we want to get you
[1:12:19] to. We don't want to get you dependent
[1:12:20] on emotion. We don't want to get you
[1:12:22] dependent on some preacher coming by and
[1:12:24] speaking some word over you. We want to
[1:12:26] make sure that we are in Christ. And
[1:12:28] when we are in Christ, this belongs to
[1:12:30] us.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; In Christ, we have positive blessing.
[1:12:35] Not make believes, not shams, not
[1:12:38] putons.
[1:12:39] But as long as you're trying to say
[1:12:41] you're in the promised land and are not,
[1:12:42] your sins will find you out.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; The first thing you know, you'll find
[1:12:45] yourself phoning. We call in the world
[1:12:47] gmed up. You'll find out you haven't got
[1:12:48] what you're talking about. But when
[1:12:51] you're in Christ Jesus, he's promised
[1:12:54] you heavenly peace, heavenly blessings,
[1:12:57] heavenly spirit, everything. Someone say
[1:12:59] it with me tonight. Everything is yours.
[1:13:03] You're in the promised land and in full
[1:13:05] possession of everything.
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; Listen, what what do we say? What are
[1:13:11] these spiritual blessings? What are the
[1:13:12] blessings in the word that's been spoken
[1:13:15] to us? What were the blessings over each
[1:13:17] one of the tribes that we talked about?
[1:13:19] They were natural blessings that were
[1:13:20] spoken by a prophet.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What do we have in this age?
[1:13:25] Spiritual blessings that were spoken by
[1:13:27] the prophets and revealed by the prophet
[1:13:29] of this day.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? Spiritual
[1:13:32] blessings. If the word says I can have
[1:13:34] it, I can have it.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? Whatever I have
[1:13:38] need of, I can take that spiritual
[1:13:40] blessing. Brother said Abraham had a
[1:13:42] right to the promise. And the promise
[1:13:44] was his. Yet he had to fight to possess
[1:13:46] it.
[1:13:48] Brother B says the believer today I'm
[1:13:50] done here in just about five minutes. I
[1:13:51] can tell you're ready to be go home. So
[1:13:56] got just a few more minutes. I'm not
[1:13:58] lying about that. I promise.
[1:14:01] Maybe six or seven. But
[1:14:05] brother said the believer today yet
[1:14:08] we're heir to all things yet we're heir
[1:14:11] to every spiritual blessing.
[1:14:15] He even goes a little bit further. Every
[1:14:18] physical blessing,
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; every blessing the Bible promises,
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; yet you have to fight every inch of it.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; Why don't we have more spiritual
[1:14:32] blessings? Because you got to fight for
[1:14:34] it.
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; So, Brother Brandham uses that in in
[1:14:39] possessing all things. And he uses,
[1:14:41] you've heard it a hundred times
[1:14:42] probably, but brother Brandham uses that
[1:14:44] Abraham going after Lot. Remember Lot
[1:14:47] belonged to him. Why did Lot belong to
[1:14:50] him? Because he was in the land. The
[1:14:51] land belonged to Abraham.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; So Lot belonged to him. So he went back
[1:14:55] and but but God didn't just say, "Okay,
[1:14:57] Lot belongs to you. I'm going to deliver
[1:14:58] him on your doorstep." He had to take
[1:15:00] his trained men and go down and fight a
[1:15:02] little bit. When he got done fighting,
[1:15:05] he possessed all things,
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; right? and come back and met MelzDC on
[1:15:09] the way back to communion with him. So
[1:15:11] you got to fight to possess it. That's
[1:15:13] what we have to do. Now you say,
[1:15:14] "Brother Brandon, I need healing. The
[1:15:15] promise is yours. But if you ever get
[1:15:16] it, you ain't going to get it easy." I'm
[1:15:18] going to tell you, you're going to have
[1:15:19] to take it away from Satan. Satan
[1:15:21] captures your health. You got a right to
[1:15:23] go to Satan. Say, "Give it back. Hand it
[1:15:25] over. I come in the name of the Lord,
[1:15:26] the possessor of heavens and earth. I'm
[1:15:28] his heir. Give it back.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; You took my child." Oh, listen. I know
[1:15:32] this has happened many times. You got
[1:15:34] her mixed up with the wrong boy. You
[1:15:35] took my boy and mixed it up with the
[1:15:37] wrong girl. Mixed up with the wrong
[1:15:38] girl. I claim them. That's right. I
[1:15:40] claim my children. I claim my brother. I
[1:15:43] claim my sister. Yes. Oh, I got
[1:15:45] something I'm claiming right now. Yes,
[1:15:46] Satan. You took them from God's house.
[1:15:48] Coach them out there. But I'm coming
[1:15:50] after them. I claim them. What if we
[1:15:53] would all be like Abraham tonight? Say,
[1:15:55] I'm claiming my brother. Well, I haven't
[1:15:56] seen them on in church on a Wednesday in
[1:15:58] a while. Haven't seen them in church on
[1:15:59] a Sunday in a while. Let's claim the
[1:16:01] promises of God and say they belong in
[1:16:03] the house of God. They don't belong in a
[1:16:05] barroom. They don't belong out in the
[1:16:07] world. They belong in the house of God.
[1:16:09] Yes, sir.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; Sitting in heavenly places in Christ. I
[1:16:15] claim them. You say, "Well, how you
[1:16:17] know? I'm an heir of all things. It's
[1:16:18] given to me. I'm an air. I can claim
[1:16:19] everything God promised me." There you
[1:16:21] are. It's mine. How do you get it?
[1:16:23] Something you done? No. It's the
[1:16:25] unmmerited gift that God gave us. What
[1:16:28] was it? The blessing. Blessed be.
[1:16:30] Hallelujah. the father of our Lord Jesus
[1:16:33] Christ who hath blessed us with all
[1:16:36] spiritual blessings.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Listen, he said Satan he
[1:16:40] said Satan cannot hold it if you go to
[1:16:43] him in the scriptural authoritative word
[1:16:45] with faith to say it's mine. So the the
[1:16:49] best thing you can do when you're facing
[1:16:51] a trial, when you going to claim
[1:16:53] something, claim your healing is quote
[1:16:54] the word of God.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; Right? That's what Satan can He cannot
[1:16:59] hold on.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; See, he's got his hand dirty hands on
[1:17:03] it,
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; but he can't keep it if you claim it by
[1:17:07] the word and let the Holy Spirit enforce
[1:17:09] it in your life.
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; I like that. He said, "Satan, you lay it
[1:17:13] down. You took it from me, you give it
[1:17:15] back because I'm serving notice on you.
[1:17:18] I've got the notice written right here
[1:17:19] on the word. Heavens and earth will pass
[1:17:21] away, but this notice shall not."
[1:17:24] Hallelujah. So I come with this notice
[1:17:26] to serve on you that Jesus Christ said
[1:17:28] whatsoever I ask the father in his name
[1:17:30] he'll give it to me if I say to this
[1:17:32] mountain be moved and don't doubt in my
[1:17:34] heart but believe this what I've said
[1:17:35] shall come to pass I can have what I
[1:17:37] said lay it down what does he have to do
[1:17:39] church he has to lay it down because
[1:17:41] you're not coming on your word you're
[1:17:43] coming on the authoritative word of God
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; hallelujah what do you have need of
[1:17:48] tonight if it's a spiritual blessing
[1:17:50] that's promised in the word if it's a
[1:17:52] physical blessing that's promised in the
[1:17:53] word grab a hold love that promise and
[1:17:55] say, "Satan, you got to let go of it.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; I'm claiming it. It belongs to me."
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; See, spiritual blessings are for you.
[1:18:05] They belong to you from a God who's not,
[1:18:09] to use an old term. I know it's not
[1:18:11] politically correct today, but he's not
[1:18:12] an Indian giver.
[1:18:16] I don't know how we would say that
[1:18:17] today. A Native American merchant
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; trader.
[1:18:29] He doesn't do that. Musicians, go ahead
[1:18:31] and come. I told you I wouldn't be long
[1:18:34] tonight.
[1:18:36] God, don't take it back. Listen what
[1:18:37] James 1:17 says.
[1:18:40] You tell the devil this.
[1:18:43] If you're watching tonight or if you're
[1:18:44] here and you the devil just beating you
[1:18:48] up.
[1:18:49] You just beating you up.
[1:18:52] Says you're not good enough. Here you're
[1:18:54] supposed to have a position in the
[1:18:55] church and look how you failed. And here
[1:18:58] you're supposed to be a Christian. Look
[1:19:00] what you've done. Look look what you
[1:19:03] haven't done.
[1:19:05] You think he doesn't try to do that to
[1:19:06] the preachers too? He does.
[1:19:12] You're you're supposed to be a a
[1:19:14] believer, a message believer, and you
[1:19:16] don't have any power with God at all.
[1:19:17] Look at the things in your life. Look,
[1:19:20] that's his job. That's that's his job.
[1:19:24] But spiritual blessings belong to you.
[1:19:26] And you give the devil this scripture.
[1:19:28] Every good gift
[1:19:31] and every perfect gift is from above.
[1:19:36] Hallelujah. and cometh down from the
[1:19:40] father of lights
[1:19:43] with whom is no variableness.
[1:19:48] In other words, if you ever spoke
[1:19:49] something, it's exactly
[1:19:52] not
[1:19:54] not true just for one hour or one day,
[1:19:56] but it's exactly the truth 100% of the
[1:20:00] time, exactly what he said. with in whom
[1:20:04] is no variableness, neither shadow of
[1:20:08] turning.
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; So if the sun of God's favor is shining
[1:20:13] on you, and it is, church, if you're in
[1:20:15] Christ, if the sun of God's favor is
[1:20:18] shining on you, it won't ever go out.
[1:20:21] Hallelujah. It will never diminish. It
[1:20:23] You say, "Well, I'm getting older." But
[1:20:25] God's favor doesn't get any less because
[1:20:27] you're getting older. He's still there
[1:20:29] with you. He's still able to keep you.
[1:20:33] Hallelujah. Abraham was a possessor of
[1:20:36] all things, including the salvation of
[1:20:39] his brother. He just had to go fight for
[1:20:40] it.
[1:20:42] Hallelujah.
[1:20:44] You know, I'm glad we can possess
[1:20:47] spiritual blessings.
[1:20:50] You know, you say, "Well, I I just don't
[1:20:52] know what to do." Well,
[1:20:55] let the devil know whose side you belong
[1:20:58] on.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; Pick up your sword. Fight that thing.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; Don't let it just overwhelm you. Fight
[1:21:05] that depression. Fight that anxiety.
[1:21:07] Fight that lust spirit. Get Fight that
[1:21:09] thing.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; There's no variableness in God. If he
[1:21:15] ever honored a repentant sinner, he'll
[1:21:17] honor you. If he ever honored a person
[1:21:20] who come and ask for help, he'll honor
[1:21:22] you. If he ever healed one whose hands
[1:21:24] were laid on him and and the prayer of
[1:21:26] faith shall save the sick, if he ever
[1:21:27] did it, he'll do it for you. We've seen
[1:21:30] him do it many times. We believe that
[1:21:32] he's still the same. But you know what?
[1:21:35] If I was a if I was a rich man, people
[1:21:37] would know it.
[1:21:40] You know that they would know it. I'm
[1:21:43] not good at hiding it. If I was a rich
[1:21:45] man, there'd be a the best grill money
[1:21:48] could buy to smoke meat on. If I was a
[1:21:52] rich man, I'd wear nicer clothes. If I
[1:21:56] was a rich man, people would know it.
[1:21:58] Maybe that's why I'm not rich. Cuz if
[1:22:00] you get a little bit of money, you know,
[1:22:01] you spend it. If I was a rich man,
[1:22:04] people would know. But I wonder if
[1:22:06] you're a blessed man tonight. If you got
[1:22:09] spiritual riches, I wonder if we can let
[1:22:11] people know about it. I wonder if people
[1:22:13] that look into our lives could say that
[1:22:15] must be a blessed man cuz the devil put
[1:22:17] them through the meal last week. They
[1:22:19] had a hard trial, but yet they come to
[1:22:21] the house of God and raised their hand
[1:22:23] and smiled at the preacher and loved one
[1:22:25] another anyway. Why? because the devil
[1:22:27] couldn't take away those spiritual
[1:22:29] blessings that were placed in their
[1:22:31] life. There is no shadow of turning with
[1:22:33] God. Oh, I'm so grateful for that today.
[1:22:37] Hallelujah. Let's bow our heads
[1:22:39] together. Heavenly Father, I thank you
[1:22:41] for these spiritual blessings that you
[1:22:44] brought to us.
[1:22:46] Oh Lord, I thank you for love and joy
[1:22:49] and peace and longsuffering and
[1:22:51] gentleness and brotherly kindness.
[1:22:54] Oh Lord, thank you for faith. I thank
[1:22:58] you for these gifts that you placed in
[1:23:00] the word. Help us, oh God, to fight for
[1:23:03] what belongs to us. Help us to have a
[1:23:06] revelation that if we are in you, you
[1:23:08] have blessed us with spiritual
[1:23:11] blessings,
[1:23:13] Lord. That if we have a need of a gift,
[1:23:15] you'll have a gift operate in just the
[1:23:17] right manner or in the right order just
[1:23:19] for us. If we have need of healing,
[1:23:22] you'll have healing there for us.
[1:23:25] If we have need of the salvation of our
[1:23:27] children, Lord, somehow the right word
[1:23:30] will be spoken and the right thing will
[1:23:33] be said and the right thing will happen
[1:23:34] in their life that'll bring them to you.

[1:23:57] stand, so that we can be better
[1:23:59] Christians. We pray Jesus name. Amen.
