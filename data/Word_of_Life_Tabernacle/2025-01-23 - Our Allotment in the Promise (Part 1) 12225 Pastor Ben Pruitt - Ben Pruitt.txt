thank you for all that you do I pray you'd move me out of the way tonight and speak directly to your people we pray thank you for doing it in Jesus name amen amen God bless you turn with me to Genesis chapter 49 we'll just read the first verse tonight we're not going to get very far into this I want to speak on our allotment in the promise but we won't hold you too awful long tonight we'll go deeper into it at another time maybe next Wednesday the Lord willing I won't be here on Sunday I've got to go preach at gleen and I promise after that I don't have anything else scheduled but uh we're going to go preach up there for them they've been such a blessing to us uh so when they asked me to come I just felt like I needed to do that but uh we're going to we got some things coming up that are exciting and some things that we're planning we're already planning the meetings this year uh we're also planning just a couple things that we don't have settled yet but we're just to give you a little bit of a hint um we've got something for the married couples we're planning to do this year early this year and then we're going to do something for our elders so you uh uh are seniors I guess we could say uh you kind of be watching for that and we're going to try to do something special for you all we sure appreciate our our older Saints don't we uh don't we appreciate our older Saints ones that are here and [Applause] faithful brother Bill I seen sister Karen look at you you know old she thinks you're old what does she know you know she's so young you know she wouldn't know but but we sure appreciate all of you older folks and younger folks but we put a lot of attention on our young folks so we're going to try to do something for those 50 and up uh coming up so you just be praying for that and and uh if you want to help with that we'd sure be glad to have your help uh Genesis 49 And1 it worked when I took it off Sunday night now it's ringing it says and Jacob called unto his sons and said Gather yourselves together that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days I want to speak on our allotment in the promise I pray Lord would that His blessings to the word you may be seated an allotment represents a specific amount or allocation of resources I want you to think uh with me tonight deeply as we go into this uh it's a specific amount of money or time or land given to an individual or a group for a particular purpose so that is an allotment it's what you've been given for a particular purpose this begin as I begin to think about these things and it begin to be quickened to me this week I begin to think of how different the 12 sons of Jacob were from each other they were very very different young men and yet God they were all the uh sons of Jacob they all came from the same father but each one had his own experience in life each one had his own family each one had his own allotment in the promised land and yet each one was born to live on the land allotted to him and and we find that and if you go and listen to uh message brother Brandon preaches a series of message called adoption I think it's adoption 1-4 I'm in the middle of listening to that again myself and brother brandom when he preaches the adoption series he begins to uh tell us that these people they didn't just happen to get a certain piece of property you know if you inherited something and it didn't quite fit you uh it might be something say uh your grandmother played the piano and you got her piano well if you don't play you might treasure that as a piece of Furniture but it's not really something you can do anything with it might be an inheritance but it's not an allotment for a specific purpose so if you were someone uh who were giving who was giving stuff away to your grandchildren or something like that you might put in the wheel a certain person would get the piano why because they play the piano right because they have that skill to be able to that gift to be able to do that well God not only did that but being he is God and he's a able to do what he wants to do and set things up how he wants to do it he not not only gave the children that could do it but he put in them the the kind of nature that they would do it does that make sense so he allotted them to a piece of land piece of ground that they would find in them the ability to fulfill and to to possess that portion of the promise and he's done the same thing for us spiritually that he put within us the ability if you're a mother if you're a a preacher if you're a a deacon whatever it is that God called you to do he's put within you that particular allotment that ability to fill that uh that that particular part of the promise and you do have the ability to do that you may not always feel able or even qualified but I'm so glad that God put that in you and gifts and callings are without repentance he actually did that before the foundation of the world he put give you an ability to do what he called you to do so he doesn't just call you to do something and then and then not give you the ability to do it but who he calls he equips and he equipped you not when you were not even when you were born but before the foundation of the world you were already equipped to be what you are if you're a Christian today you were equipped to do that before the foundation of the world you don't have to stress about or worry about it and think well you know how will I ever make it how am I ever going to make it in leosia he chose you for this particular time and this particular place are you hearing me church he chose you for that he allotted that to you before the foundation of the world I know that's deep and you got to think deep but I think we all should understand that that that God chose us for a particular time and a particular place not just the preachers but each and every Christian we would have different roles right and they would be way different from each other but all would benefit the kingdom of God so the 12 sons of Jacob being very different men that were chosen for a particular piece of the promised land when Jesus chose his disciples they were very different now I'll give you kind of a clue where we're headed maybe in in the weeks to come if the Lord allows me to do it I want to go into each one of those those sons and talk about some of those differences and what they were and how that would apply to us but now these these these men were different and when Jesus chose his disciples he chose 12 disciples 12 very different men that filled 12 very different roles in fact one of them was even a devil right they were all predestined to something right right and and 11 of them were predestined to life and one of them was was a devil and yet they made their own choices they had their own faults and failures and different things but but yet God uh predestined them for a particular place in a particular job brother brand said I believe that God is a god of variety he said the world proves that he's got big mountains and little mountains he's got Plains he's got deserts he's got different things because now look he made it the way he wanted it I love that line he's got different things because he made it the way he wanted it how boring would it be if we were like brother brandham said a serious and robu Harmony House if we were all you know in a church if everything was just set the way we wanted it we had all the different people you know if you got to choose the church members if if you got to choose the people in The Bride what kind of people would they be well I'll say somebody did choose the people in The Bride somebody did choose the people in this church but it wasn't us it was God and so many times it don't it looks strange to us as as colors in a pallet would be it might look strange to uh to the what to certain colors to that that are so different from other colors and here's one that's boring but it serves to complement that Vivid color and that Vivid color without this boring color come on Church wouldn't look very good right but the two together they come together and make something beautiful each piece of the Ark may not make much sense each Rose in the garden may not make much sense but but together it produces something that God wants it produces a picture that God wants to have so he said he made the season summer winter spring autumn he made the seasons it shows he's a god of variety and even variety within the seasons in different parts of the world right he made you in a variety some men are real blusterous and some are real dogmatic and others are fine others are kind now think about this for a minute you might if you're a fine person or a kind person that's a very different personality type from blusterous or dogmatic but God made them both both right and if you're a fine person you might look at a blusterous person and think surely that can't be God working in that manner and yet God needed if you're a fine person maybe there's some things you wouldn't say that God needed said right that a blusterous person might say as long as he does it within the boundaries of the word right and maybe uh maybe a person Brother Band talked about how humble brother Neville was what a wonderful man he was he said but you can't be too humble because he said you got to be able to say the things that need to be said that's right right so he he made us in a variety some men real blusterous some are real dogmatic others are fine others are kind and you just find all different kinds of people in his kingdom I I don't want to pick on any of us tonight but I guess I could pick on my own family we're we're very different there was eight of us children every one of us very very different one from the other you know me and Joel and we're just about Polar Opposites but we work together right we love each other but we're polar opposite we got different people and some and what you'll find is you fit in better with some people but they may not be the ones you need right in life they may not be the ones that can help you even though you fit in better with them but maybe they're not what can help you because iron sharpens iron so if you only hang out with people who are like like you right who who think like you do yeah you life becomes a whole lot easier you cut everybody else off it becomes a whole lot easier but you don't grow that's right right because you got to be able to well if somebody else maybe the next door neighbor say had a little bit different idea of how to do things but maybe that helps you to learn some things so so that's the way these these were in the Old Testament and the New Testament the 12 sons of Jacob and then the 12 disciples but Brandon said look at St Peter judge him by Andrew he said see Andrew is that prayer Warrior just stayed on his knees all the time the Apostle Peter was one of those fire brands that preach and so forth and so and Paul was more scholarly like more like a prophet or something to set back and maybe those people who who were attracted to Peter's Ministry wouldn't have really been attracted to Paul's but they needed both of them right and some that were attracted to to Paul's Ministry wouldn't have been really attracted to Andrew's Ministry but they needed both of them so you look at Paul and Peter that that's a great example of of a real Clash of characters Galatians Chapter 2 and verse 11 when Peter was come to Antioch he said I was stood him to the face because he was to be blamed right now that's pretty that's pretty uh harsh is it pretty Brash you just you just Paul just comes out and says I withstood him and Peter saying you didn't have to use my name there you know yeah wrote it in a letter he said for before that certain came from James he did eat with the Gentiles but when they were come he withdrew and separated himself fearing them which were of the circumcision now but look this difference between them did not cause a permanent split now here's where we got to grow up right right just because have a difference of opinion with somebody doesn't mean you got to leave the church come on now just because you think differently from somebody maybe they might sit beside you see you could be right come on but you could be wrong right and sometimes it's just a difference for JT and our personalities and dealing with that and we make personality the gospel and it's not the gospel the gospel is what's written in the book right that's not the the personality is just the way that we do things right and many people get used to a certain personality say well we want everybody to be like brother Ben I know wouldn't the world be a wonderful place if everybody was like me but it wouldn't be a wonderful place because it would devolve into something terrible why because it would not be what God wanted it to be God wanted some blusterous men some fine men some some men that were good and kind and all in between so they didn't allow the difference to cause a permanent split and we know that because second Peter 3:14 this is amazing to me he said wherefore beloved seeing that you look for such things be diligent that you may be found of him in peace without spot and blameless and account that the longsuffering of Our Lord is salvation even now he's going to quote the scriptures quote Paul who called him out in writing and said he was to blame he said our beloved brother Paul look at this our and Peter wasn't known for not saying what he thought he said what he thought right but he didn't let this you know see Peter and Paul realized there was something bigger than themselves that they were working for Peter was wrong in this instance Paul was right we talked about another situation where it seemed like Barnabas was had a better idea than Paul did maybe he did right but they went different direction but if it hadn't been for they going in different directions Timothy would have never come along right so there's a there's always a reason why things happen the way that they do but now we find Peter acknowledging that what Paul wrote was scripture even what he wrote about him think about that you talk about being the bigger man look he said brother Paul our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given un him hath written unto you as also in all his Epistles yeah including the one where he said Peter was to blame right speaking in them of those thing these things he said in which are some things hard to be understood which they that are unlearned and unstable rest they wrestle with them as they do also the other scriptures so he called them scripture he said unto their own destruction see Peter and Paul understood something that we lose sight of sometimes that a man could be a man of God and dis agree with me yes right a man can be called by God and disagree come on Church your your wife's not always going to agree with her sometimes she's got a point sometimes she doesn't but you're not always going to agree with her and she's not always going to agree with you but that don't mean you put your differences aside and you move on right you don't just let that destroy your marriage the difference is listen to me Church the difference I had somebody tell me in counseling one time they said well you don't understand because your marriage has always been perfect and I said boy I wish you knew that's not how it works no but I said I said some of the situations you've had is the same things we've had we've had money problems we've had situations with children we've had trouble in our home we've had I've got a a personality that's hard to live with sometimes huh if you don't think so could meet me on the first day of a diet right that's not every day deal with me the day after I preach deal with brother Joel the day after he preaches right right we we're hard to live with sometimes but yet God called all of us right and we got a goal we got a purpose and so what I I told him I said you know me and my wife just didn't let that take us down well yes we had a difference but we were committed we're going to stay together we're going to love each other we're going to do what's right we're at the end of the day when when night time comes we're not going to fight about it we're going to move on we've had many struggles that don't mean that we give up come on Church think about it in a church setting we don't give up because we struggle or because we think well this person they're not as nice to me as they should be or somebody else now we're always going to have little things like that maybe we were called for different things for different purposes you be you and let them be them and look for an opportunity to come together are you with me so far he said now Paul preaching he said I beseech you Brethren by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that you all speak the same thing yes there be no divisions among you but that you be perfectly joined together in the same mind in the same judgment he said for itth been declared unto me of you my brethren by them which are the house of Khloe there are contentions among you he said now this I say that every one of you saith I a Paul I have Aus and I have sephus and and I of Christ so there was one Church in in Corinth you know and in that time you didn't have uh the first church of Corinth and the second Church of Corinth it was just the church at Corinth right but they had their differences and so it began to split up into faction and so you had certain parts of the Church of Corinth were saying well I like what Paul says right and some of them say I like what Apollos says I like what Peter says right and every one of them wrong because they needed all of those men to be able to come to a maturity that they needed to come to and they remain babies and Paul deals with that we're not going to stay in Corinthians but Paul deals with that how that they remain babies because they couldn't they couldn't come to understanding like the Ephesians did because of this factionalism he said you say I'm a Paul I'm of Apollos I'm a sephus that's Peter I'm of Christ is Christ divided was Paul crucified for you oh come on Church your pastor wasn't crucified for you that's not I'm not the reason that you're saved right this church is not the reason that you were saved you were saved by the blood of Jesus Christ there's one thing there's one wheel as brother Joel said here recently in the middle of the wheel that we all all the all the wheel whole wheel has to turn around that we don't get to just do our own thing I was not baptized I was not crucified for you you weren't baptized in my name he says I didn't die for you he said I'm just part of God's Great program and Paul was a great part maybe the greatest part until the messenger of the end time because he was a prophet that had to every messenger even brother brandom had to follow that pattern that Paul had and yet he recognized that he was just fulfilling his part in the kingdom of God he understood that the message was the important thing right not the messenger in the sense of not me the the Flesh of me but the message itself remember there was no certain leader at the head of the brid group remember we talked about Sunday morning did that did that strike you Jo that struck me here comes the bride here comes the church they had a witch leading them yeah but when the bride came by they they weren't separated by National Group and there was there was no one at the head they were marching together but they were watching the message right the voice standing there with the messenger and oh my cuz they had confidence that God sent a prophet are you with me now and that he would speak the words of the Lord and that it would call them back into the step that they needed to be in oh Church we're not watching even the Flesh of the messenger today we're watching we're watching I'm going to get into that maybe as we get close to the end but we're watching the word we're watching the message we're watching for or hear listening for a voice we're not following a certain leader right but we're looking for that listening for that voice so now if you take all these different people you know very different so say and I'm trying to get it where even the kids can get it you know you look at our kids they're very different so Peter's very different from trip and trip is very different from Landon right they're all about the same age but they're very different right and that's good yes it's not a bad thing they're very different right and maybe there'd be some say well I wish this one was more like that one but they're very very different good Christian young men I believe Holy Ghost filled young men right but they're very very different right and if you took 12 of us you took a sampling of 12 of us Jaden and maty are different they're friends but they're different from each other not just different in general but and then then you have a Chase and Wyatt they're very where is Wyatt very different there he is coming in the back everybody watch W as he comes down the aisle very different sorry W you know some like attention some don't like attention right right these girls are very different one from another but God made you that way you see you've got a particular part of the promise that you're going to fulfill some of you might be preachers Preachers Wives preachers uh uh helpers deacons deacons wives you might be somebody who just works somebody who's tuned to business who's able to make a good living so you can help out in the church we need some of those too right you're tuned differently the problem is when we start trying to make everybody the same God didn't make you all the same but now think about it now 12 like if we could call these the 12 sons of Jacob there's not 12 of them but these boys just appear these the if you look at the differences in them and say that they were all sons of Jacob and they're all sons of Abraham sons of God but if they were all sons of Jacob how different that they would be and what they would choose to do and their gifts that they would have and yet the trick is how do you get those different people together all working together doing the same thing for the same reason you got to have something in common what do you have in common you have one savior you've been baptized into one body by one Spirit are you baptized into one body and that's how you enter brother B teaches us that in adoption that's how you get in the land right first of all and he said we're only preaching to those who are in the land so if you're not in the land you need to get in the land how do you get in the land by the baptism of the holy spirit so the adoption series was preached to those who are in the land but but being in the land that's what gives you the ability to work together come on Church you have something in common something that you're striving to do every one of our musicians wants I'm not preaching from notes I'm just talking to you every one of our musicians wants to have the same thing this presence of God in our services right but you got to play something different and feel a part to do that right you got to be willing to fill your part to play your part because if everybody tries to be the main thing you got a problem right and sometimes and music is a great analogy for it because sometimes a certain instrument leads and sometimes they back off and let somebody else lead depending on the song Oh church we only learn to do that spiritually sometimes we could recognize this person has a gift for this let's let them lead in that area and then let somebody else lead in a different area the pastor don't have all the gifts right and I'm thankful for all of you leaders you people that do things but Pastor don't have all the gifts but then again then again sometimes your area that you're working in it seems like well nobody notices nobody sees it but if you weren't working in that area no one would be come on and somebody needs to be a prayer Warrior somebody needs to be a worker in the field somebody needs to go to work every day and it seems like they're not doing nothing but they pray over their lunch and they pray and in the evening and they come back home and they're raising up a mighty warrior in their house they're raising up a young lady in their house that's going to go going to make a difference a young man in their house don't underestimate what God's going to do in your life you look it over at your plot that you're working and your allotment think well there's not much to that but there is more than you think and every one of us has a part to play how do you get all these tribes together well in the during the Wilderness Journey all the tribes were camped out around one thing yeah what was it the Tabernacle yeah they were gathered around the shakina that anointed the word the table of testimony they were gathered around all church that's what we have to do we put aside all our differences and we gather around the shakina we gather around the manifested word of the hour and and he is our Center Christ is our Center in 1 John 1:7 says if we walk in the light if he is the center of our of our life if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another why because though we're different yet the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanseth us from all sin yes now they all come from one father but that didn't mean they'd all think the same right and don't you wish your pastor always thought like you did but if I thought like everybody else I it wouldn't do me much good would it you wouldn't need a pastor you know if your wife always agreed with you you wouldn't need her if if a deacon always agrees with you you probably don't need a deacon right so we're going to do we're going to have our our discussions and do things differently but when it comes to the main thing where what what are we here for church we're here to see God move we're here to see the presence of God Among Us we're here to see see Souls Born Into the kingdom of God we want to see more come into the land we want to see everyone that God's called till the last one comes in and one day we go home that's right so there might be one person that travel overseas and nobody else does it but God fit that one person equip them to be able to do that and another person just stay home day after day year after year but we need both of them where it won't work so each one of these young men and each one of these tribes were born to do and to be a certain thing but the problem came when one tribe become jealous or discontented and tried to either separate themselves or take maybe something that wasn't theirs a possession that they that that didn't belong to them to do something they weren't called to do now we know brother random taught us and we'll get more born to this later but each one was born under a certain sign and given a certain name right and not even knowing it brother said Joshua didn't even know but he he allotted them a land that would go with their name even though he didn't realize it he did it under the inspiration of the holy spirit so some of the tribes were similar to others yeah and even worked together and got along well some of the tribes were even split into halves cuz they couldn't even get along with themselves it's true but they were each unique I I we think of and I've preached to you about Benjamin and we'll get maybe we'll go through that but that's my name so I notice things about Benjamin in the Bible and Benjamin had a whole crew of left-handed sling throwers is that what it is sling thrower Slinger I'm not sure what you call that slingshot guys slingshots left-handed that's inexplicable like why in the world would One Tribe be filled with left-handed right why would one family be full of preachers and another family be full of musicians and another family be full of of people that can make money right and maybe part of a family can make money in part can't just don't have a gift for it right we identify with that part to can't make money can't we aren we I I mean I I do but you know people and you look at other people think everything they do turns to Gold but they're gifted for that and there's a great listen Church there's a great uh piece when you find what you were meant to do and you begin to do it and it begins to work for you and you begin to realize this is what I was to be and I may never be flashy I may never be great I may never make a lot of money but God called me for this and let me do this and not try to do everything else on amen God called you for a certain thing each one was born under a certain sign given a certain name and and fought a particular battle predestined to a certain place they had to fight for that place and stay in that place now we are predestined to our place in Christ Ephesians 1:5 having predestinated us unto the adop opon of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will verse 11 says in whom that's Christ also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will and again that's a hard thing to swallow election predestination is difficult for us to swallow no matter how much I would explain that to you is it's got to be something at some point you have to come to terms with an all powerful God who doesn't think like we do on right he just doesn't think like we do at all we can't think like that he said my thoughts are higher than your thoughts my ways are higher than your ways at some point you have to come to peace with that and say Lord you do what you're going to do right let me do my part I want to do the best I can being predestined don't mean I don't fight it don't mean I don't struggle it don't mean I don't I don't get under desperation do the best I can do but in the end it's ultimately up to him he's who put the fight in me if I have a fight in me he put the fight there that gives me peace to know that it's going to work out in the end so Joshua placed Israel in a natural land we have been placed in a spiritual land of promises but they're individual promises to individual people and maybe in your life you've dealt with a lot of sickness so maybe God wanted to heal you think about this for a minute the man who was blind remember the man who was born blind and the disciples got real legalistic you know and pharc and they stood there and said now did he sin or did his parents sin it had been pretty hard for him to sin get punished for it he was born blind they said did he sin or did his parents sin and Jesus said no that the works of God might be manifest in his life he was born to be healed church he was born with a purpose and that purpose was to wait 30 years and then be healed I wonder church we we don't realize sometimes the things that we deal with is for a purpose that maybe we were born for the purpose that that that God the glory of God one day would be shown in us at the right time he said when will that time be by the B I don't know I don't know how long it'll take I don't know what the journey is going to look like I don't know how hard the mountain might be and how high it might be but I know you climbing because you were born for that purpose that's your allotment we wonder sometimes why a person think about the the little Mexican baby that passed away in brother R's meeting died in the morning but she was born into a family with a mother who had a I guess an extra dose of faith and perseverance that little woman wouldn't take no for an answer and when when the when the crowds she wouldn't let the crowds get in way but she crawled under people and over people trustees tried to stop her and couldn't or ushers tried to stop her and couldn't stop her and everybody tried to stop her and couldn't stop her and so brother BR said finally you go pray for her he told Brother jackmore you go pray for her he said she won't know the difference so he goes down to pray for and all of a sudden brother man sees a vision of that baby being well that dead baby laying in a blanket been laying there dead all day why was that baby born why was that mother born so that you could hear that story so that we could take take courage and know that God still raises the dead he was born for the glory of God and you were born for the come on Church you were born for the glory of God to exhibit God in your life yes maybe you've gone through some hardship but remember it all work toward the glory God all things someone say it with me all things work together for good to them that love God and are the called according to his purpose yes sir sometime you got to quit blaming God I I said something Sunday night when it come to our marriages and getting married and you got to believe that God's Not The Village Idiot sometimes we treat him as if he is we treat him as this because of our past we want to whine about that and we want to carry on about what our past has been all the things we've been through and I understand I don't mean to be harsh with you but I do it too how hard the road's been not recognize God let us go through that job had a revelation in the mean times we don't have job said if I got a problem it's with God right if there's an issue with way things have gone it's not with my friends it's not with my wife it's not with somebody else he said I want to talk to God because if I could talk to God God would explain to me why I've been through what I've been through see that's what's going to hold you Church there got to be an Abiding Faith in an everlasting God a faith in a good god a God who will not who will keep his word who will not reneg on his promises who will not give up on you you right yes you got to believe in that kind of a God Amen good job had to say God if I get talked to you and finally had a conversation with god maybe it wasn't what he expected to hear job expected to be able to complain and God basically told him to shut up read the book of Job he said listen to me for a while where were you where were you job why he knew where he was in the mind of God the sons of God sh together for joy and so he never did tell him why he took away his family never did tell him why he just restored it to him what so we could hear the story so we can read it as part of the scripture job was just God's God's guinea pig if you can say it that way to show that the inoculation of Faith Works and every one of us are going to prove to the devil that it still works today that this message works that there will be a people come out of Leo to see you there will be a bride without spot or wrinkle you're going to prove that to the devil before you get out of here right excuse me for yelling at you tonight but you are you are predestined to a place I'm not getting very far but we can pick it up later brother Brandon says but now to the place he said how are you in other words how are you put there you are first born into the kingdom by the Holy Ghost he said the next you are predestined unto what adoption what is it you're predestinated unto placing and he explained that there there was a Doctrine then that Jesus was there in a physical body and he was wandering around the earth and if you happen to meet up with him you could be healed brother BR said that wasn't true he said his holy spirit's here and he's trying to place his church to get his church in order place it in the promised land so they can enter so that all the enemies can be drove out brother Bon begin to explain we'll just take the next few minutes and deal with this how that how that the people not understanding their place affected the Pentecostals and affected his own Ministry he said Manasses can't take his land right he said I can't have a healing service he said when have go out there and preach the baptism in the name of Jesus Christ and the trinitarian brother say oh he's old Jesus only now I'm just going to get real with you it's about that bad today we label preachers without even looking to see what they're actually preaching come on now well they come from this or this is what they are look at what they're preaching is it the word if it's not rejected but if it is accepted right but we look at associations and who they preach for and where they come from that could be a wolf and sheep's clothing right look at what they're preaching see if it's if it goes with the word or not and he said I can't go over here and have Divine Healing when half of them says Divine Healing is all right he said a lot of them enjoy the Miracles of the Lord and say well I believe brother BR is a prophet let me tell you something as long as the spirit's on him he's Discerning he's the Lord's servant but his teaching is rotten it's no good he said whoever heard of such Tommy R it's either of God or it isn't of God see if he's a false teacher what that would make him if if his teaching was false and he had signs it'd make him somebody you need to run from right it don't make him somebody to celebrate that's how the modern Pentecostal World tries to make it fit with brother BR because they realize he was a prophet and they realized he was a great man of God who did things no one else had done in the last 2,000 years we hadn't seen that kind of ministry right but then they realized that that happened so they tried to say well he was a good man and a prophet but you can't believe his Doctrine right well then that kind of man that's a false teacher you need to run from him an antichrist right some of the said don't work like that e either the sign is of God and the word is of God or he's false completely right and it could be a false anointed one but you don't listen to a false anointed one you run from him right right so it's either all God or none God he said that's the way it is but how you going to have he said Manasses won't keep his ground Ephraim won't keep his ground Gad won't keep his ground Benjamin won't keep his ground they're all running out here with the Philistines and all mixed up see we don't belong out with the Philistines right we belong together come on but in many places you know it's gotten to where it's hard it's easier to get fellowship with denomination than it is with the message that that shouldn't be that way church right we should be fellowshipping with one another we don't belong with the Philistines come on let them feel their part they got a part too but that's not our part right there's good people out there just and there's bad people around the message but we belong here yes this is where we belong sure there's people that don't live it there's people there'll be if you go to church very long you don't have to go very long to find out there's people that don't live the gospel they claim to believe claim a whole lot more than what they live and and I hate that I don't want to be one of those people but I recognize this I belong here in the message of the hour there might be Hypocrites but there's good godly people as well there might be people doing it wrong but there's somebody doing it right and this is where you can be Washed by the Water of the word this is where a hypocrite can turn his life around and become a child of God yes huh we're not we're not going to just go out and fellow and and start fellowship with the Philistines cuz the can't get along with each othero I know that's that's tough but how are we going to get placed brother said we have been born by the Holy Ghost all of us what are we born to predestinated after we're born we're predestinated unto the adoption to be placed in the body of Christ what is the body of Christ some are Apostles some are prophets some are teachers some are evangelists some are pastors is that right he said we're called to others has Gifts of tongues interpretation of tongues wisdom knowledge miracle Ires working of Miracles all these different gifts and now what they do he said they practiced that a little bit so the Pentecost had enough Faith to believe that God kept his word right so they believe that the gifts were for today but what happened is they all started wanting the same one yeah right and that was tongues everybody wanted to speak in tongues they made it the the the evidence of the Holy Ghost which is obviously not according to the scripture amen but they made the tongues the evidence of the Holy Ghost and and what they would do is and some of you that come from Pentecost can amen that they preacher start preaching they interrupt the preacher interrupt the service there's no order and brother Brandon said they would call the preacher a backslider if he continued with his message because they believed God had spoken well wasn't God speaking through the preacher wasn't God speaking through the word right but they didn't want the word they wanted something Sensational and so uh and so he said they got out of their place and so so he said the Bible said the spirit of the prophets is subject to the prophet God is no author of confusion right he said when I'm standing here a minister under the anointing of God he said no matter how much you want to speak with tongues he said you hold your peace till God's finished here right he said then if you speak with tongues it can't be just some repeating of scripture because God said don't use vain repetition but it's a message directly into to somebody and if you go read this the brandom deals with this very specifically and talks about what what it ought to be and and he said it's not just something generic he said we are predestinated unto the adoption of sons adoption we're born into the spirit of God sure receive the Holy Ghost and cry Abba Father Hallelujah glory to God he said we're that's right we're children he said but we can't get nowhere right we can't whip the Philistine right every one of us got a Philistine we need to whoop come on are you with me now every one of us got some Amorite or hiide or deite or website has been said many times something that we need to we need to beat yeah right every one of us got depression or or anxiety or or sickness or something that we need to we need to space head on every one of us do it may be different different people maybe the person that doesn't deal with depression doesn't understand a person that's got it person that doesn't deal with anxiety doesn't understand a person that's anxious but yet you know they weren't called to your battle you're called to your battle you got to fight your battle deal with that that Philistine and the reason many times we can't get nowhere we can't whip the Philistine is because we're too busy looking at each other fighting with one another not everybody's going to understand you that's okay move on look forward and fight the enemy with all that you got and help your brother all that you can brother BR talked about Billy Graham and the Muslim and how he was challenged he couldn't meet the challenge he talked about Joe Lewis who was an atheist a boxer and a Church of Christ Minister who who got up with Joe Lewis and condemning Jack Co I guess they had some kind of press conference or something condemning Jack Co and he said he talked about a church that calls himself Church of Christ shaking hands with him with Joe Lewis taking sides against brother Jack Cole he said how are we going to do anything and the Pentecostals many of them against him when every preacher in our land ought to stand toe-to-toe with him and say God send down your power see there we are where it can't be placed so if we see God anointing a special Ministry we ought to all be willing to stand there and say God we want to fight for him and if we see it get off the word call it out right but as long as it stays on the word support it no matter what church it comes from come on church it's hard for even me to do but it's true no matter what church they come from no matter what their background is no matter but if it's a man of God living the word and he's preaching the word and God's using that let me get behind it because it might be something that'll help my children might be something that'll help the church huh good we we don't want to move with political mindedness right we want something that'll help he said God send down your power see there's where we it can't be placed he said Ephraim don't want to stay them go over here we find Manasses gets over here said oh my lords give me a good corn field he said then Here Comes Gad said well now wait a minute I'm supposed to raise oats but I'm gonna get some corn too Hallelujah you can just see that what a great picture you know they're both on their little corner you know and he's over here raising oats and and that corn looks so good his oats maybe mature at a different time so they don't look so good right now so he's watching that corn field man if I could only be like Andrew Glover I mean the cornfields you know right I could preach like that and maybe I'll try to mimic him try to raise some corn that's not what we can do right we got to be ourselves well if I could just be brother Joel you know I thought that you know if I could be just like Joel you know and and but that wouldn't work it wouldn't be me it's not my pasture it's not my corn field right or my oats field he said see you ain't got nothing to do with corn get oats oats is your part to raise see you got to find that brother Peter that's the challenge when you're young when you're when you're just starting out especially is finding where you fit what you should be doing you're not called to do everything find something and do it are you with me now sometime we want to specialize in everything and really we end up specializing in nothing find something God called you to do find something you can do find something God's anointing you to do and stay there in it work that field if it's opening the door if it's shaking hands with people if it's helping out in the kitchen whatever it is find it and do it yes good good find what you're good you say well if I'm not if I can't do what they do I'll just sit down and do nothing don't ever get like that amen God help us never to get that way that temptation's there man sometimes I just want to quit I hear preachers and I just want to quit or I want to get up here and say something like this why don't y'all back me like you do them y'all running the aisles and jumping over pews and huh I want to stand up here and say well what about me I don't have that type of ministry and I know it yeah it's good but sometimes God will use me you know I went over to Oklahoma and brother trip watched the service he said he said You Preach over there like you wanted to be there I said well they amen that way you know but God made us different for different times it's okay to have a a sermon sometimes where we just lay the word in that's all right right it's all right to have church sometimes maybe we're not here all night but yet we felt uh the presence of God so real while we were that's okay to have a one hour service or a two-hour service whatever God wants us to have right this isn't a cookie cutter thing God calls all kinds of different men all kinds of different people all kinds of different musicians all kinds of let's just Place let's get in the field God called us to and stay there and work there come on Amen we always want to do somebody else's job well if if I could do that I you feel like you're not doing anything you end up in a position you don't need to be in that's why in some Churches everybody's a preacher not everybody's called to preach and you don't want to do that if you're not called to it trust me he said Hallelujah he said he said you can't tell them a thing about it no no they still got that nature he said but but but but but quoting the prophet but but but but but but but he said see you can't tell them that's right said no isn't that true and you can't place the church see he said the church is supposed to be predestinated unto the adoption of children just think about one man said you need to bring those to the altar your goat nature the church is supposed to be predestinated unto the adoption of children where a man God can take a man and adopt him into the family give him something he said first try that and see if it's right so when you get something don't go looking for something else say well I'm spiritual now try what you've gotten and see if it's right the Bible said try the spirit this man claims a certain thing try it and see if it's right if it say right move right with it and say Lord send us something else keep moving see just keep moving till every fellow takes his place and you're going to see the Church of God begin to take it its place he said then when the Philistines will go to back and up the shorts will go off hair will grow down faces will be washed cigars will be missing he said that's right when the church begins to get into its Mighty power when we have an anasis of fire and a few of them he said you'll see when that Holy Ghost Church that Holy Church stands together in his power positionally placed as sons of God adopted into the family of God a powerful Church standing there in his glory oh that's what he's coming for that's what I believe he has today a church without spot or wrinkle but we just need to find our place yes that's good and I'm so glad in this age we have a message that come to put us in our place a message to come to positionally place us that's the hour that we're living in the age of adoption if we could say it that way we can go to our place see we don't get to choose our gifts or callings they're without repentance I would choose a different one if I could but we don't get to choose but God gave Joshua the job of dividing or allotting the land to each individual tribe he told him he said be strong and of good courage for unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land which I swear unto their fathers to give them be strong and of good courage I think we all need to hear that brother wendle was here preaching and and I'll tell you something he told me he didn't tell us he was here preaching and brother wle has a certain way of putting things and maybe I wouldn't put things the same way brother wle does that's why God called different men but but you know and and we can all you know we all have to stay within our boundaries in that brother window said he was praying for somebody and and all of a sudden in the middle of the night he said he come to him go tell Ben PR to be strong and very courageous I took that as a personal you know I don't that don't have to be anything great but I think that was something that God wanted me to know be strong and very I think God wants you to know that or he wouldn't have put it in the scripture be strong and very courageous be strong and of good courage you're going to need courage to make it unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land which I swear unto their fathers to give them amen oh my be strong and of good courage now why would he need to be of good courage because he's going to tell some people what their land is they're not going to like it but they were born to do it yeah good yes yet they don't always mean you like to do it I'm I'm almost out of time look it's the holy ghost that does that for us it makes the word a reality I'm going to skip down we'll come back to my goodness what was I doing spent way too long on that brother brand talked about how Joshua fulfilled we know Joshua fulfills three types let me get this before we go he fulfills the type of Christ that's the main type of Joshua he's Jehovah savior right right he's the hly the Holy Ghost he's type of the Holy Ghost same thing he's the type of the end time Messenger right who carries a message which is Christ but he is a type of the end time Messenger as well it's all the work of the Holy Spirit and a body of Flesh you got to watch types because we get mixed up in types because we think if he's this type he can't be that and that's not the way it works because a type is just a shadow right it's not the real thing so Joshua Joshua was a type now brother brand said let us stand like Joshua and Caleb he said our promised land is coming in sight how many believe that tonight even as theirs did I'm way down there brother Robert I'm sorry in the pergan church age he said now Joshua means Jehovah Savior and he represents the end time leader that will come to the church even as Paul came as the original leader Caleb represents those that stayed true with Joshua so there's a type here where Joshua is end time leader and Caleb represents those who stayed true with Joshua and we stay true to the messenger and the message we stay true to Christ not to his personality not to him some kind of a deity but to the message that he brought are you with me now because the message is Christ said we're not coming together to talk about the message we're coming together to get in the message and the message is Christ is the word we're to get into it get beneath it brother's whole point is that it's not say I believe the message or I believe the messenger you got to be in the message you got to be in Christ and again we we saw the preview of the Bride which each one of those young women kept their eyes on the you stand except for a few at the back remember who who had begun watching the American group and when they watched they got out of step and brother BR says this and and and someone actually sent me this quote and it just fit right in here it said keep in step with Joshua keep in step with Joshua that's right get the new grapes and the new Pentecostal wine how many want some new grapes and new Pentecost where is it it's in step with Joshua it's in the Promised Land he said get drunk on it brother he said you won't even have to look to the world anymore something will happen to you oh my he said oh let let us go forward amen following amen let us go forward following the steps of our great leader and conqueror he said remember God told Joshua every place The Souls of your footsteps that's possession brother he said them footsteps mean possession he said let's just keep walking into the promised land Not Looking Back to see what will happen back there what somebody else is doing is here using the type of Joshua as Christ he said keep your eyes on Jesus the Joshua the leader keep moving on deeper depths and higher Heights oh I wonder if we could do that tonight until you possess everything someone say everything everything that God promised you in his word he said all men cannot receive this listen we shouldn't look down on people who can't receive it all men cannot receive it this is hid to the eyes of the world and fol to them but those who are born and elected to eternal life believe it there's something in you you were born to till this ground you were born for this message that's why you love to hear it that's why you love to hear it preach that's why you stay even though many others have left you were born for this piece of real estate called the message of the hour there's something about it you were born to it you might have been through all kinds of struggles seen false teachers and everything else rise up but you are born to till this piece of ground so you come back and fill your seat day after day year after year brother Herald decade after decade why you were born for this you were born to hear the message of the hour you were born to manifest it good Hallelujah BR said all men can receive it but we see the hour we liveing let's go forward let's go forward remembering it he said there's someone behind us all power on Heaven and Earth is given to him to the son to Christ what do we do we stay in the land when someone tries to push us off of it we say Joshua gave me this land yeah was spoken by a prophet revealed to me by the Holy Spirit right I'm keeping my eyes on Joshua oh yes oh I got so much more than we could say tonight and I had Skip by a whole bunch of this tonight we'll get to it maybe next Wednesday but let's be like Caleb let's be like Caleb who reminded Joshua the promise musicians go ahead and come reminded Joshua of the promise and said give me my Mountain give me my Mountain what did he say he said I'm I'm 80 years old today he said but I was strong strong as I was the first day that we came into the land the day we I got the promise he said you remember what Moses promised me I just love that he he didn't wait for Joshua to come to him he come to Joshua and he said you remember he said now I've been helping other people get their land I've been helping other people get their blessing but you remember we had a special deal you said that if I would wholly follow the lord God that I would have a certain piece of real estate and remember Caleb had went down there and spied it out he went into the land SPI it out when he did he saw a piece of real estate with the biggest Giants and the biggest walls and the toughest place in the country to take is probably the very place that the other spies looked at and said there's no way we can take it did you see Hebron did you see what it looked like did you see that hill where the anakites are they said that's the biggest of the bunch the ones with the longest necks the tallest ones big strong men yes and Caleb said that's my Mountain oh that God would give us a faith like that that's my Mountain yeah it's been a little bit difficult yeah there's been some things that have been tough but I was born to take that mountain that's my hill to climb that's the place I'm going to overcome in listen we all face Leo deia we Face a time when it's hard to be a young lady Lady it's hard to be a young man it's difficult to be a good Godly mother or Godly father but remember you were born for this land why don't you go to Joshua the Holy Spirit and say give me my Mountain don't remove the difficulty but give me strength to overcome it give me strength to comeing come on church can we not be stirred by the preaching of the word to say give me my Mountain give me what's mine in the message of the hour good and he obtained that promise the Bible says because he wholly followed the Lord God I want you I want you to know that we're sold out for the promise we burn our bridges like Alexander did his ships Alexander the Great crossed over the boss for straight he he he burned his shifts behind him he said we got a smaller Army than them he said but we're professional soldiers but the Bible tells us there's more with us than be with them may look like just you and Jesus but you and Jesus are a majority wholly follow the lord God be sold out to the promise I don't want somebody else's land I don't want their promise let me be sold out to mine I don't listen church I'm not a compromiser I I hope I don't come across like that I I believe in this word but I refuse to spend all my time looking over the fence what somebody else is doing what kind of a crop they're growing God help me I don't want to spend all my time looking at the other and preaching to them God gave me a piece of land let me till it until the young people come up in it and the old people come up in it and the people get strong you say Well church there's churches that do it wrong let's do it right we've done it wrong in the past let's do it right from here on out let's go forward said but the you made decisions that weren't right let's move on go forward I'm sure I did I'm sure I will again at some point but I believe God is with me and God is with you and and he said Joshua looked at Moses he said I will be with you as I was with Moses and he said he knew God had been with Moses in his mistakes and he knew that he would be with him in his mistakes let's go into the land amen 2025 let's walk into the land I'm won't Grumble no more I won't complain no more I won't I won't look over at somebody else's plot no more I'm won't press on to the calling of Jesus Christ my Lord I won't waste my time trying to be something I'm not but give me my mountain and I'll clim it sold out to the promise of this day God said what a pastor could be let me be everything that God called a pastor to be in this hour would you do that in your own position whatever that it is me be everything that God called me to be and God has called us he's called us all to the Rapture if I can't make a Rapture in my generation I'll pave the way for the Next Generation brother Brandon said if I don't have the faith to take it I won't stand in the way of somebody else that does I mean pave the way lay the foundation if that's what God is willing for the Next Generation to take it give me my Mountain my allotment my portion let me fight in that place Heavenly Father Lord as we bow our heads together in your presence I've been so free to preach here your people have been so receptive I thank you for that Lord I I thank them for Lord listening and coming with expectation tonight I pray that you just move Lord give us our Mountain maybe for some people it's the last crest of the Hill the last mile of the way but give me that mountain if this is the last day I live on Earth let me be walking uphill the last day so my children can make it the rest of the way even if I never get to do anything else but cry out there's Freedom ahead I've seen a glimmer of Freedom at the top of the mountain Lord may I be one to cry with all of my heart until the next Generation goes forward and takes it Lord but if it be fit for you see fit or that a Rapture would take place in the morning let me be ready oh God God let me take my Mountain Lord if
