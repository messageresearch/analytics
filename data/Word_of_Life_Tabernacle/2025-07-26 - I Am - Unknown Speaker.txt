========================================

When it was dark in my heart, you brought life to me. &gt;&gt; A child of darkness became a child of light. Amen. &gt;&gt; When my soul was so dry, &gt;&gt; you and I needed drink the waters of life you became to me. I am I am you gave to me. I am alpha. I am omega. The in between. I am I am. You said to me, "I'll be what it takes &gt;&gt; to meet your need." &gt;&gt; You were the widow's crucifous. You were the shelter for Noah. Come on. A shepherd for the sheep. And in the fire you were the fourth man and a cloud by day, a fire by night for your children to lead the way. I am I am. You said to me I am Alpha. I am Omega. The in between. I am my arm. You said to me, "I'll be what it takes to meet your need. [Music] I am I am." You said to me, [Music] I am the bread of life standing. I am I am. You said to me, I'll be what it takes to meet your needs. I'll even go the way to Calary. [Music] Aren't you glad for that? Glory to God.
