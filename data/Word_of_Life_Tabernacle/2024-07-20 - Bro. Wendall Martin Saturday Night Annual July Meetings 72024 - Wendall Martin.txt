========================================

15 of them last night I think that is right isn't it Brethren the five first 15 of those cards that was given out now we'll call some more of them and maybe tonight if faith is coming hot maybe we can get two or three groups of them and if not I asked every person here how many people in here that doesn't have a prayer card and would want to be healed by God tonight just raise your hand doesn't have a prayer card well it's just you can hardly tell it's just solid everything where I'm going to ask you something this may be my first time of Ever meeting it it's too bad that we can't stay a little longer in meeting and you know how to accept Divine Healing Divine many times when people are healed a growth is a is a demon every sickness is of the devil God would don't put sickness on his children the devil does that and if Satan cast out Satan you say well the devil heals too well Jesus said he couldn't he said if Satan cast out Satan's kingdom is divided so he can't only God can heal medicine doctors do not claim to heal male Brothers is one of our best authorities they said we don't want claim to heal so we only claim to assist nature there's only one Healer that's God they can sew a place up in your hand but they can't heal it they can only SE it up a dentist can pull a tooth but who's going to heal the place a doctor can take a pendic out but who's going to heal the place he C God does medicine doesn't bu tissue medicine is only an aid to God is the Healer right doctor can set your arm but when he comes and set your arm and you don't go out and you're not well the doctor does his part what he's taught to do and knowledge to do he set your arm but he leaves it for God to heal that's right all healing is of God so now you just believing and sometimes when those gr the life go out of them as the demon well then those gr die if the life went out of you of course you would die your life will go from you but the body's still there it shrinks if there's an Undertaker here no as a human body anybody any uh flesh strengths when the life is got watch a little animal when it's when it's uh killed on the road it'll weigh or some of you Hunters here if you kill an animal beef or Butcher and you lay it on the scale and weigh it now just kill it wa and in the morning weigh it again see how many times lighter it is then let it lay there for 2 or 3 days then see how many times heavier It is Well a growth when it dies the demon goes out of the growth like tumor cancer cataract so forth when the demon goes out of it which is aive every person here come from one little germ and and you begin to develop cells and those cells uh come into after the nature of the life that was in it which made man the cell from the dog makes the dog the bird the bird ever after its nature every kind but now a demon which is a growth or it doesn't have to come and grow it's um starts developing cells say for instance cancer it's starts to developing cells and becomes larger larger well now it's got a life and it's a living just the same as you was living and developing in the womb of your mother the same thing you're developing but now that life isn't your life it's a different life you've got life to live and that's a life of death or a spirit of death rather pardon me and it's death now it doesn't belong in you it wasn't in there before but it's there now well then who put that in there it only has to come from one thing that's the and it's a germ cancer tumor any of those things come from a germ and you come from a germ too see so when that die for instance like cataracts the person's got cataracts when the spirit leads the people say oh I can see I can see and the next day they can see much better well then about after about 72 hours corruption sets in like the resurrection of Jesus that's the cells didn't corrupt you raised before the three days and nights of course you see died on Friday afternoon rais Sunday morning called David said I'll not leave his soul in Hell neither I suffer my Holy One see corruption those cells begin to break in 72 hours and uh but and then when the patient when that begins to swell that growth getting bigger they'll of course your heart has to purify the bloodstream a lady came to me last night a very saintly Godly looking woman with a big cancer that she said she come in the line and said it was all covered over her hair and said I stood looked at her and told her under the spirit she had cancer in her head but said it was going to come off and it come off and she's got it here I guess tonight here in a bottle of alcohol right here now youve had thousands of them is a woman in the building would you stand up if a woman's anywhere in the building with that cancer in the alcohol if she's anywhere in a building is she standing up wave your hand or something so someone would see you yeah there's the lady standing there okay and um I've seen him stand right on the platform just turn white and drop right off on the platform see now that's a miracle usually when the growth is dead the life goes out of it but the growth if you can't drop off it's on the inside and if it does of course it'll lay there for a few days and begin to swell up like any other flesh the cells will begin to break then you get real sick with a fever of course it's an infection like the heart pumps the blood and purifies the body there's a big lump of Flesh laying loose in your body the patient gets violently sick then they say oh I felt so good when on the platform and for a day or two but I guess I've lost my healing why brother sister that's the best sign in the world you've got your healing see and then you start dis beling and just as sure as your faith taking the life away your unbelief will bring it back again it will it'll resurrect it remember Jesus said when the unclean spirits gone out of a man he walks in dry places then he returns with seven other Spirits is that right and the so let the good man of the house Faith there no matter how you feel it ain't what you feel it's what you believe Jesus never did say did you feel it he said did you believe it that was God bless you all right now let's see I believe that was 100 prayer cards they gave out last night and wise when we never got to all of them let's take the last 15 of them tonight to try who has prayer card 80 be oh 85 who has prayer card 85 would you raise your hand if somebody here somewhere in the prayer card 85 all right 86 who has prayer card 86 all right 87 87 do I see someone with credit card 87 please if you would you stand up 8 or 87 is what see somebody maybe can't get up maybe there on a stretcher maybe they're deaf and and they say well no one help me and I I get the back SP of it in my office they say well I was there and and you just said from so and so to so and so and nobody helped me and maybe he was de now look we got 85 86 87 look on your neighbor's card and see he may be de he can't hear 87 thank you sister 88 who has 88 prayer card 88 is it in the building 88 all right 89 is prayer card 89 can you get up 89 is it hand up for 89 all right 89 all right 90 90 only now with everyone in here if you just do now what he says do and no matter what he says do you do it just do it just just you go do just what it says do now I'm your brother and just a man now if he will come and and take this poor frame and bless it enough to let his holy spirit work through it then you'll see Jesus Christ moving in the audience and now no matter how much he would vindicate himself here if you don't believe him he can't do nothing for you is that right no matter if he stand right here but my side visibly as you could see well if you didn't believe me I couldn't do nothing for you but my my words will be just what he has said out of his scripture and I'll pray with all my heart that God will help you because he'll be probably mothers and dads and so forth in here that's that's sick and Afflicted and needy and I'll ask God to help you the best of my knowledge all right line up over here on the right now let's all bow our heads just a moment kind father we pray in the name of thy son Jesus May the Holy Spirit come now and manifest The Works of Jesus Christ bless these people everywhere and make them to be whole make them well make them healthy happy and now in order to do this father thou knowest the frailness and the th of thy servant and I I don't know what to say or what to do and now I have did this all at thy command and I believe that you will be here tonight to bless and to help these people and father if you'll just let the Holy Spirit come to your servant and and reveal these things to us what we should do and how we should do them then we will all be happy and rejoice and this audience will believe on you with one heart and Accord and father I ask you this as your servant let not one feeble person leave this building tonight May the everyone go well and healthy and rejoicing do it will you father I pray with Grace in my heart and faith in Jesus Christ's name amen [Music] now many times is there someone on those lights someone at the light that could move them now sometimes this Holy Spirit it comes and many of you seen the picture if I ever come again I'll bring you some of them as the Brother Moore was telling tonight it's been taken several times and in the books I guess you all got them we I only had two boxes so I uh hope you enjoy them real well and now they you look in there you'll see another picture of it where it settled down in a newspaper photographer caught that when it C in Arkansas but it wasn't authentic like this American Association and they they got it and it was then it became authentic so we and many thousands of people I was standing on the river here some time ago baptizing 500 after a Revival and it come right down where I was standing and people fainted and just there where was and it was just like a roar noise whipping fire I I pray that God will come visible before the audience tonight in that manner here it's a capital once more if I can find favor with God now you realize it could come to some eyes and wouldn't to others we don't want to think that but it does John was the one who bear record seeing the spirit of God over Jesus is that right never said the A and the the wise man followed a star do you believe that and it passed over every observatory in the land always in the orient weeks and months are coming and they kept time by the Stars they watched all night long they kept time and no one ever saw it but the wise man did for they were looking for it You' be looking for Christ tonight you'll see him the Lord Jesus bless you all right then Billy Paul Brother Moore some of you is every is ready is they got the whole line lined up Billy the whole 15 all 15 lined up now to the rest of you try the ones that hasn't got a prayer card and know you won't be in the line I want you to look this way and just believe and you believe with the same kind of faith that that woman had touched His Garment and he turned and said thy faith has saved thee do you believe he's the same tonight do you believe in all that howling mob that poor little old blind man sitting down by the walls of Jericho probably twice the distance of this building a scream and a holler and have mercy on me Jesus perhaps never heard his call but he felt his fi that move and all that bunch of critics and he turned and said thy faith has saved the he turned into the audience and said differently why reason you in your heart said to the woman at the well go get your husband and he said I can do nothing except the father shows me I to ask you something if what I have said is the truth if it is the truth then God's obligated to his word not to me but to his word is that right he's obligated to his word and then he will bring that to pass just exactly the way he said he would do it and if he does do it will all of you then in here if you haven't receive Jesus Christ would you be willing to do it and you that you're that can see his Mercy to others yeah he will have mercy to you if you'll just have faith and believe just pray and say Lord I I'm a Believer and I want you to heal me tonight and God will do it we have just left Africa recently where I'm to return again in the next few weeks Africa India Palestine Germany and a Ministry and at Durban South Africa after about three or four people have passed through the prayer line and they've seen the power of the Holy Spirit moving in the people and and seen what God was doing 30,000 accepted Jesus as personal Savior and one all Rec call 30,000 at one time so I believe if we'll take God's word as the rule and go into all the world and preach the gospel the gospel came not in word only but through Power and demonstration of the holy spirit so the the gospel is demonstrating the power of the Holy Spirit I've went into Nations that say now we we don't want missionaries we know more about it than you do but the thing we want to see is somebody that's got faith enough to make God's word manifest that's what they want to see and that's how they get converted that's how they find Christ is because they they believe in that man and I trust to God with all my heart that there will be many many here tonight who will find Christ the same to their heart may the Lord Jesus Jesus of Nazareth bless each and every one of you is my prayer now okay no man seeks God at any time God seeks man never did a man seek God in all the world God seeking man when man first fell in the Garden of Eden it showed the strain of man man hid God was hunting man Jesus said no man can come to me except my father draw him it has to be drawn of the father first and then I would like to explain something to you uh seeing a vision how many people in here ever dreamed a dream let's see your hands I guess 2/3 of you there is true that many people doesn't dream that's your subconscious we're taught here's your first conscience here's your subconscious now this subconscious is what I'm trying about with the Holy Spirit to work on this first conscience I might ask this man here any man along here someone do you believe oh yes sir you believe it here but what about this man down here he's the one that runs the ship not the man up in the Pilot House it's the man in the engine room sometimes when you go to sleep you go into this subconscious and you dream and you dream of things you did when you were here then when you wake up you remember things that you dream you people that dreamed dreams many years ago you dream them you still remember well there was some part of you somewhere isn't that right or you wouldn't remember something that you dreamed many years ago now the man who sleeps sound his subconscious is way back he never gets to him but a sear his subconscious is not back there neither is it here it's right here he doesn't go to sleep he got his eyes open and he just seen now that God gave that man a place where he could sleep sound and not dream God gave man the way to dream dreams I'd say dream me a dream you couldn't do it then God puts in the church stum Apostles prophets Gifts of healing is that right they're all for the perfecting of the church Paul said if there come if you all speak with tongues and the unlearned comes in won't he say you're all mad but if one prophesies and reveals the secrets of the heart won't they fall down and say truly God is with you you is that right is that the gospel well wasn't that Jesus Christ yesterday isn't he today you can believe him by speaking with tongu you can believe him by the Holy Spirit and I believe him in the full measure that he is the same Lord Jesus he's not dead he rose from the dead and here tonight here at the platforms now and may He bless and help I've never been in this country before and as far as I I know there's not a living soul that I can see before me that I know very few here on the platform brother Bose I remember him I've seen the man there next to him I don't remember his name but and I brother Lindsay just a maybe three or four ministers studing here that I know in the building but God knows all of you is that true he knows all of you now this lady standing here God in heaven knows I never seen her in my life as I know of Are We strangers lady we are perfect strangers but God knows her now if Jesus is the same yesterday today and forever let's change a picture now what he was yesterday when he was going to find out something about a woman he said bring me a drink she said why it's not customary for this to happen in Jews and so forth with the Samaritans but Jesus speaking to her a little while he found just where her trouble was is that right now if Jesus has risen from the dead now and is living in us tonight a little while the world sees me no more yet you shall see me for I eyes a personal pronoun I will be with you even in you to the end of the world that's the gospel truth you might not have read it that way or thought of it that way but that's the way it's written in the Bible that's your theology might have bypassed it somewhere but that's the way it's written in the Bible I will be with you even in you to the end of the world now uh you know I'm waiting for something that is true it's the angel of the Lord that's true I'm just as helpless as it could be just like any rest of you and I'm here perhaps with critics sitting here how many ever seen his picture not of my meetings have seen where the scientific taking his picture of the great light it comes in you can watch it yes many of you sold thousands of copies have it been sold so forth the Douglas studios in Houston Texas has it were George J Lacy the one of the best in the recent search in America take an exam everything to see it wasn't a double exposure or something and Jesus Christ Vindicated himself as being the same yesterday today and forever now of course I wait for him whether he will help me tonight I do not know and if I have said anything boastfully or anything that I've said out of the way may God forgive me I wouldn't mean to do it I only mean with humbleness of heart to represent Jesus Christ who's listening to me now and may his mercy be here tonight and I've spoke these things and that being his word may he come and help us as my prayer and now as the organist here somewhere if she will slowly please real low the song only believe and everybody please be in a a mood of prayer if you will you don't have to bow your headless you're ask now in the prayer line you that's coming what be if he rebukes you you must if it's it'll be the truth if it is you must be willing to stand it in the audience anywhere if he said you must know it's not me it's him and go make it right the first thing you can do before you can find a cure you've got to find the cause before you can find a cure you go to a doctor sick and upset and he gives you an aspirin he's not a good doctor he's trying to get rid of you if he's a good doctor he'll diagnose the case till he finds in trouble and then start working from there that's the same thing we have to do here if an evil spirit if he unconfessed sin or something or some out of the will of God you can anoint them all night long and cry and scream and do all you wish to that demon will stay right there that's right that's right he has a right to but that's what you have to watch God has put a curse on somebody for something then you come along and take it off you get in trouble like Moses did that's right PE you he the Holy Spirit now in the name of Jesus Christ the son of God I take every person in here under my control for God's glory now I want to talk to you a minute sister your your conscience that something's going on of course it's just now happened now if that is true let the people see by your left lifted hand that's right see it's that's that pray this right now I I'm a stranger to you never seeing in my life and now if the holy spirit that I have spoke of of Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever if I have truly witnessed that to the people and declar it to be the truth and he is the same then he will reveal to me something to you that would help you to believe him if you're here I don't know what you have need of whether uh but he does now if God will permit that would you accept your healing and or or whatever it is you want Finance or whatever it is you're here to seek Him for to ask him about or domestic troubles whatever it might be whatever it is he'll know and he'll be able to let me know is that right right and that would make him the same as he talked to the woman at the well now I'm only talking to you like he did to contact your spirit and I see you moving from me you're you're you've had a I see a great crash of some sort it's an accident and you it was a car wrecked and you

verse we want to say that it's such a privilege to be here and what a wonderful meeting we have had and um just being with all of our friends that we've known for so many years and and to see all of the support from the ministers and and the local churches and it's just I say God richly bless every one of you such a such a blessing and you know brother brother Ben is he's just a Prince of a man and and we we love brother Ben and we've been friends for many years and and you know brother Ben's never changed he's just he's the same guy that I knew when I amen when we were both younger amen both of us had a little more hair amen and um so we appreciate uh he and his wife and the congregation here and and uh it's just been it's been uh so wonderful to be to have a part of this meeting let's look here in in 2 Thessalonians the 1 chapter and the 5ifth verse it says which is Manifest token of the righteous Judgment of God that ye be counted worthy for the kingdom of God for which ye also suffer Amen Let me see here I'm in the wrong place you love him amen no I'm in the right place let's just keep on going sixth verse seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you to you who are troubled rest with us when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in the flaming fire taking vengeance upon them that know not God and Obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ who shall be punished with Everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord From The Glory of his power when he shall come to be glorified in his Saints and to be admired in all them that believe because our testimony among you was believed in that day I want to read also in the Book of Revelations the 10th chapter we know this scripture here by heart amen praise the Lord Revelations 10 And1 and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face were as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the Earth and he cried with a loud voice as when a lion Roth and when he had cried seven Thunders uttered their voices let's go to the Lord in prayer father we want to thank you today for your love and your blessings Lord these last three services have just been such a a blessing to me I have received strength and Lord I've I've enjoyed the the words that you have spoke and I needed to hear them Lord and I'm asking Lord that you would just speak tonight as I step out of the way and that you would help me Lord to to just deliver what you would have to speak Lord Lord I I I want to surrender everything I am to you now for the for the blessings of your people I ask Lord that you would bless brother ban and I ask that you would bless the congregation and all of those that labor here Lord bless all of the pastor and the and the ministers and the and and all of those who have come to to make this meeting so special I ask Lord that you'll bless every one of them and may they leave Lord with something deep down in their heart that they were glad to come we love you father in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ can the church say amen amen and amen God bless you you may be seated here tonight amen I want to speak here this evening on the authority of the sons of God and I believe this is the age amen of sunship this is the age of maturity brother sea was preaching this morning I didn't know whether to just sit down on him and quit amening him or not because he was walking all over my sermon and um I as I left I said well I guess I need to pick another and my wife says just preach what you was going to preach amen and uh did you enjoy that message here this morning this is the age of maturity this is the age of the Rapture this is the age of sunship Amen brother brenon would say his his ministry comes from them reformers back to the original word again the word comes to a prophet and he's promised it in Malachi 4 to restore the faith of the people back to the original grain and what went into the ground here is the same the grain has come up through here it has come up as the Son of God now it reveals itself as the son of man and then it reveals itself as the son of David on the throne see them three sons just exactly oh my again like the original now to the ministry of himself you see God's got a God's had a design God's had a desire all along it's to bring you and me back to our place that we fell from in the beginning can you say amen amen the son of man Ministry is not for just anybody amen it's not just for the blowjo amen sitting on the average Pew but amen God's got a call he's got a a plan he's got a purpose and I don't believe that there is anything that the devil can do about it God's purpose will be fulfilled in our generation can you say amen amen this is the Glorious season amen for the sons of God and the prophet of God would say there's going to be a spiritual people that will pick up what the spirit is doing in this age amen and Awakening Jesus he would say he says that's the same as it is today some people believe it amen no you could no matter how plain it would be Vindicated some won't believe it and then there is some of them so spiritual that the first little nod they get it and others can be pounded day and night and they will never get it can you sayen amen I I believe what he's talking about is there's going to be some sons of God who has been taught and trained by the word of God there's going to be a Sons and Daughters of God that the holy spirit is bringing up in this day that he can manifest himself too and manifest himself through amen this this this is the day that I believe that all of Heaven has been waiting on this is the day that amen God has been that creation has been waiting on this is the day all of Earth has been long groaning and longing for the owners of the earth to come back to their place can you say amen amen now he says he says I want to drop a little something here that'll help you he said there's a predestinated people that's going to receive it there was when he come the first time and there will be when he come comes the second time no matter what the church world's got to think about it he don't send it in vain somebody is going to receive it somebody say that's me there's going to be somebody to get it that's all amen the political world and the political Church whatever it is amen when you cry out God sends it and somebody is going to receive it and he said that is right amen the Apostle Paul would say there in the book of Romans in the eth chapter and he he would he you this is something that we all amen we we know pretty well there in the 20th verse it says the creature was was made subject to vanity he says not willingly but by reason of him who have subjected the same in Hope but because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the Glorious Liberty of the children of God for we know that the whole creation granth and travaileth in pain together until now amen not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit amen even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption amen somebody say waiting for the adoption amen I I say we're not waiting for the adoption anymore we're living in the season of the adoption of the sons of God to with the Redemption of our body can you say amen amen now this Rapture or this adoption is not for everyone it's not for the church member it's not for those that amen just uh uh read a few quotes and listen to a few messages you're going to have to take this word and this word has got to have an effect upon your life amen God don't want you just sitting in a church God don't want you just amen and a preacher but God's intention is for the manifestation of the sons of God it's God's intention to bring you into that fullness that he has predestinated you for well glory to God Amen it's easy for us to see a preacher and say Amen there put a lot of responsibility on the pastor put a lot of responsibility on the Evangelist it's easy to put a lot of responsibility on Mom and Daddy amen but I'm here to tell you God's going to Rapture a church amen without spot or wrinkle there's got to come some sons and daughters into that position there's going to be a Rapture there's going to be the manifestation of the sons of God can you say amen amen this Rapture is for those who were ordained to that Seed Life in this evening time and they will come to that and brother Brandon would tell us adoption amen is when those redeemed Sons Hallelujah well praise the Lord he would talk to us about that adoption amen when that word would come into that maturity and I want to say when that word Falls as a mantle upon the sons of God Amen are you hearing me it's the season when the owners of the Earth are coming back to what God has ordained for them to have amen hallelujah sin and death has ruled and Reign amen masama died Grandma's died great grandmas died amen we fight sickness we fight diseases we fight come on church amen Cancer's going rampid amen we've got Devils everywhere amen the Earth is primed for some sons of God I said the Earth is prime for some sons of God Amen not somebody in a religious ceremony and not somebody just coming amen and just satisfied with singing a song but something burning on the inside of the elect of God Amen to come into that position that God has ordained them to come into Hallelujah can you say Amen Let me just give the devil Fair notice we're not your average Church we're not the fifth age we're not the sixth age we're not just Pentecostals we are the sons of God hallelujah we're going to believe like Sons we're going to act like Sons we're going to love like Sons we're going to live like the sons of [Applause] God can you say Amen brother Brandon would say this is this is the time when the son when the father places his son over his inheritance gives him the authority over his kingdom and amen he's been under two ERS and governors and amen there's been the Believers of The Seven Ages and there's been denominational ages and Time After Time After Time can y'all hear an amen but there must come a church that the word is no longer preached about but where the word is living in [Applause] me under the denominational ages man there's no difference from a servant and a child under the denomination of late well praise the Lord there's no difference amen preachers got to tell you to quit acting up hallelujah amen this one's got to tell you you shouldn't say that you shouldn't do that well can you say Amen but when the son comes to that maturity I still believe the Holy Spirit is is is is leading and guiding can you say Amen now brother Brandon would tell us as he learns from and submits himself to the tutorage and faithful over the small things and amen God gives him the bigger things and well H how many believe that now we're living in a age today for you young people you know you you're you're your Mom and Daddy's driving a nice car and amen and you think that you deserve a nice car amen and you you want to go out there and get in Deb they're living in a nice house amen and you didn't

matter what we are to overcome as long as we know how to overcome what can you say Amen we're living in the day amen it's a glorious day brother darl this is a this is this is a a splendor a day of great Splendor and Glory I I I think of Jesus brother brandham said that amen that Jesus was amen adopted on uh uh on on Mount Transfiguration taken up to the high mountain and he was adopted he he was the completion of the Old Testament prophecies amen and when he went up to the mountain and and there appeared uh the law and the prophets and amen and and and and they said oh my I believe it was Peter that says let us build two three Tabernacles one for Moses and one for Elijah and and and and one for Jesus and and then the great Cloud came over them and and the cloud is it overshadowed and all they seen was Christ the denominational places were over amen all they could see was Christ well praise the Lord personalities were over man were over oh they could see and I I I can you say Amen when they went up to that mountain and the cloud Came Upon the people were on Jesus that took everything else aside pushed it off behind and there was none save Christ and then the voice came out and said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased hear ye not hear ye them he's not going to share his glory with another man he's not going to share his glory amen with another preacher he's not going to share his glory with another man or woman he's going to share his glory with himself it'll be Christ and Christ alone and he is the word made flesh can you say amen amen now brother brandom when he would when he would refer to this scripture man he says it was God that adopted his own son when he took him up he took Peter and James and John has a witness in the mouth of two or three Witnesses let every word be established and he went up there and got overshadow Christ and the Holy Spirit overshadowed Christ his reignment shine like the sun is that right God himself said this is my beloved Son wouldn't you want want to hear that from God here tonight this is my beloved Son hear ye him in other words there it is what he says is all of it what he says is all of it you man turn to your neighbor and says What God Says is all of it amen he says of course it was God but it was God In the Flesh of Jesus Christ manifesting himself to the people and there God adopted his own son can you say amen amen there in in Mark N9 and we're just going to break in here Amen to the seventh verse and it says and there was a cloud that overshadowed them and a voice came out of that cloud saying this is my beloved Son hear him and suddenly they looked around about and saw no man anymore save Jesus only with them can you say amen amen I just want to say here tonight amen that mount Sunset had a cloud and mount Sunset had a voice and mount Sunset had a word amen for this church this wasn't made up by William brandom this was not another Seminary but this was the Word of Promise that God gave the seventh angel that God gave the church it was going to be a word of [Applause] authority can you say amen amen yes sir Amen in this age of adoption the Apostle Paul said that there is that season coming he says creation is waiting amen the Saints are waiting the dead are waiting he says those of us who have the baptism of the Holy Ghost is waiting for the adoption to with the change of this body Hallelujah now you say it was a season yes there was a season it couldn't H it couldn't happen in the first age the third age the fifth age the sixth age the beginning of the seventh age it was for a specific time someone shout yes for a specific people someone shout yes when these bodies shall be [Applause] changed but there would be no change under justification there would be no change under sanctification there would be no change under 1906 it had to come with that Mighty [Applause] angel coming down upon that body well praise the Lord can you say Amen what will this adoption look like well there's going to be some common denominators there was a cloud there was a voice and there were three Witnesses praise the Lord denominations appear amen disappear in the light of that Glory can you say Amen what happened on Mount Sunset friends the mount sunset wasn't something to just Amen brother brandom look good and a stting a cult amen this was not just amen another happening that brother brandom you know that there was a cloud in the sky amen from a rocket or an airplane and brother brandom says ah oh that's going to make me look good no brother brandham told the church three months before that there was going to be seven angels and there was going to be a cloud and that he was going to be lifted up into that cloud well praise the Lord and when he was there on Mount Sunset I've got to build my I'm building my platform and when he was there on Mount Sunset then it happened Seasons brother random had already they Angel of the Lord already told him there's going to be a first pull there's going to be a second pull but the first pull didn't have anything to do with me that was brother bram's gift the second pull didn't have anything to do with me that was brother bram's gift he had the gift of healing he had the gift of discernment but Mount Sunset you guys aren't happy enough yet Mount sunet is included me hallelujah amen amen if you wouldn't mind putting that cloud up there amen mount mount Sunset cloud with the seven angels hallelujah amen Mount Sunset was God coming down amen up on his Earthly body declaring I am pleased with him it was a changing of the drama denomination denominational age after denominational age after denominational age but when a prophet comes on the scene something's fixing to happen the theologians were representing their denominations the theologians were bringing on changes of reformation but when a prophet comes on the scene God is wanting to declare something are y'all with me because this will be the age now brother for you're getting older amen I'm getting older I love brother Forest we've been friends for a long time but if the Lord should ter both of us going to be in the grave with there but there's got to [Applause] be the body of Christ whom the word has Authority in to get Grandpa and Grandma out of the grave there's got to be a church there's been churches churches Brides brides but there's got to come one that doesn't just have the mechanics but they have the Dynamics they've got the manifestation of the son of man living and abiding within them it's the changing of the drama it's the Turning of events it's a new season and you say Amen it was that season that the Apostle Paul had grown for it was that season they were looking to it was that season that they are longing Lord amen and brother Brandon would he would say there amen months before he says they come with such a great speed and there's nothing no Jets no nothing else can compare with that and I can just see them their heads kind of turn sideways and the wings tip back talking about those angels full armored and here they come and like that and just right down and took me into that pyramid that constellation of them and I seen I was off up off the ground and I thought I heard way in the distance that Roar that womb like a like a plane when it crosses that sound barrier you've heard it happen like that it's just a distant Roar he C can you say Amen you see this is is what the prophet was told was [Music] coming but three months later on Mount Sunset while he was hunting hogs it wasn't just a promise theologians can make up all kinds of things you can make up all all kind you can make yourself something when you're nothing but when God comes on a scene with a word Prophet he's got something to [Music] say hallelujah what can you say Amen brother Brenham would say he said now science took the picture of you've seen it amen and went on and the Associated Press they didn't know what it was there is a a cloud hanging 26 mil High 15 20 miles above even where the vapor is at and don't don't know what it's all about that they are trying to investigate and there right under it I was standing and those seven angels roaring out their voices of those Seven Seals standing there and the witnesses amen three of us as they witness of the things that was prophesied on the tape sir is this is what time is it can you say Amen now for many people it was brother brandham being glorified [Music] but I here here to tell you that the only reason that it appeared to him because he was the [Applause] prophet it appeared to him because he was to bring me my [Music] inheritance well we're going to worship brother brandom oh we're going to brother brandham he had such a gift oh brother brandom oh he was old brother brandham oh my and we just brother brandom brother brandom brother brandom brother brandom and we're thankful for what God brought brother brandom but are you taking heed to what the message was that brother brandham brought to you that brought to me it is the message of adoption it's the message of sunship it's the message of Vindicated word sons in this generation come on church if there's somebody that should have a faith it should be you if there's people that should believe in miracles it should be you if well come on now they're Sons somebody say I'm a [Applause] son amen it was a declaration Mount Sunset l was a declaration I've got some Sons on the earth that is ready for headship I've got some Sons brother brandham said now I was only standing there when he appeared I'm not the one that performs these things and foretells these things what going to happen as perfect as they are I'm only the one that's near when he does it I was only a voice that he used to say it so the prophet are y'all with me the prophet represented the life of this age Hallelujah all the glory that was on that seventh Church age messenger oh the glory all the manifestation of God on that seventh Church age messenger can you say amen amen the first pull and the second pull and the visions and amen the manifestations and the Glorious things that took place it was a wonderful thing people drove from all over the world they would come across the seas and bring their babies they they Kings would call and say would you come come and pray amen they would they would call would you amen would you call you remember amen Florence night Andale and there she was amen down to just a few pounds with is there a way that you can come amen prophet of God would you come oh the prophet he was on the he was on the platform night after night giving himself year after year until he was wore out until he had to come off the field for a while he was so weary in his mind and his body the people were pulling on that Son of God with that first pull and that second pull can you say Amen but it's not God's design it's not God's desire to put all of his power in a prophet the prophet was there to call some sons of [Applause] God can you say amen amen those visitation of angels amen amen bringing the pro Divine Revelations and all the Visions but when God took him to mount Sunset you were included when God took him to mount Sunset he represented you you see I don't believe it I don't believe that was that all that was just for brother Bram 1965 he said a prophet's a reflector how many knows that the reflector doesn't reflect itself the reflector is not the reflection there has to be something to strike the reflector to make it reflect so a prophet is a chosen vessel of God that cannot reflect nothing at all but he is in direct line with that reflection God to reflect the image of Christ the word nothing else can do it I said nothing else can do it it took a prophet to reflect what God was doing here on the earth amen he says now that's the reason the Prophet had to eat the book that's the reason he had to eat the scroll he had to reflect the word for that age and then he asked you got it well praise the Lord but then he doesn't stop there he doesn't stop there amen he says the Bride is a reflector too once the reflection of the word from the prophet to that age then that church becomes a reflection am well somebody ought to be shouting [Applause] yes amen he says the word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us it's the word reflecting sparking off the age that you're living in that's what he was that's what Moses was that's what Jacob was that's what the rest of them was amen sparking off that word of God the reflector of God that was reflecting himself and come to that perfect image of God Jesus Christ God's Masterpiece was struck that he might take the rest of them for a bride that he's been reflecting him Moses was in him Joshua was in him and if you are in him you was in him before the foundation of the world and the family of God you suffered with him you died with him you went to the cross with him and you were raised with him and now you are still with [Applause] him sitting in Heavenly places reflecting the message of the age to the world the light of the world what is it it's the redeemed body of [Music] God reflecting the headship of the word we're fixing to have a prayer line we don't want no one coming up through this prayer line amen ing some kind of a magic from these preachers we're going to be here in agreement with you but you are [Applause] Sons you have been given the golden scepter you have been given the word of promise you you you have been given oh come on church it's not the preacher it's not Mama it's not Daddy it's the sons of [Applause] God somebody say the redeemed body of the son of man you've got to have the same experience that that body had in Mount Transfiguration praise the Lord now the prophecy was as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the revealing of the son of man the son of man must come in a body once again it's easy to say the son of man was revealed through the first and second pull [Music] we're thankful for the Messiah signs but it was the third pool that the word came in effect to the sons now brother Brandon would ask the question he say where is the government going to be upon upon the shoulders his body the government upon his shoulders that's part of his body what is it his Earthly strength God's Earthly strength is his word made flesh in his body here on Earth he did not say a bunch of prophesier he did not say a bunch of tongue talkers he did not say a bunch of well praise the Lord I'm not I'm not I I'm not opposed to it and for your information I am a tongue talker I speak in tongues amen for your information I've seen the manifestation amen of wonderful gifts can you say amen amen but that's not what the word is the word having its effect in the Church of God to believe regardless to believe regardless somebody say I believe regardless I believe the word I will stand upon the [Applause] word man I remember brother Sean his first wife and they were there in Pennsylvania and uh I believe it was Faith who's the one that broke their arm faith faith where you at Hallelujah where is faith faith faith hi Faith amen that's my niece right there makes fun of our old songs Hallelujah faith brother sea was on business they only had one car and they couldn't get a hold of they couldn't get she couldn't get a hold of them they were down in the basement amen uh with her roller blades and uh she had faed broke her arm and I mean broke it and and it was off it was it l it was bad hallelujah amen couldn't get a hold of the pastor amen because the pastor was her husband who was not answering the phone amen hallelujah and Rebecca looked there and said I'm a daughter of God I can't get a hold of nobody else I don't need to get a hold of anybody else I've been given a message of authority if you don't believe it you're never going to put it into action if you don't believe what Mount Sunset said you're never going to be what God's called you to be this is the adoption message this is the manifestation of sons this is the headship of the word over the body this is [Applause] it when God shall be revealed and glorified and manifested in his [Applause] Saints I know there's a physical coming coming I know there's going to be a physical Rapture but the manifestation of the son of man has come to you [Applause] she laid her hands on her prayed amen and by the time she quit her prayer Faith had already quit crying she looked and the arm was just as normal is that right stand up sister Faith this is the girl look at those arms Hallelujah his Earthly strength is not the Pentecostals his Earthly strength is the word believed in his body and the Pentecostals can't do that can you say Amen won't you turn to your neighbor and say you embody God's strength Hallelujah he in his Earthly strength was wicked by the Angels when the word came the Angels when the word came the Angels showed up to declare that all of Heaven is behind that body of Believers well Hallelujah Hallelujah you say now brother W you can't you can't you can't put Mount Sunset to mount Transfiguration because we don't believe in adoption anymore brother brandham taught adoption folks and he taught adoption for a reason to separate you from those Pentecostal shocks to show you who you are in a shame 1965 brother Ram says I went up there the first on the church the first church age and there the Holy Spirit revealed it you got it right here in your church ages I guess the books will be out pretty soon now full detail of it it showed that Jesus was judge there's a white wig that they use to wear put a wig on and and and and wear as a judge England still does it when you got the supreme authority and then turn the picture in this uh in this turn sideways in this picture and and he has black hair and you can see it in his in the side of his beard and his white wig on I mean he's looking at a black and white picture and and is is the last of the authority he's the supreme authority even God said so himself this is my beloved Son hear ye him there he is with them Angels the passage which was the seven the breaking of the Seven Seals that revealed the serpent seed and all these other things and it shows that it is his very covering his supreme authority he is supreme he is wigged or covered well can I hear a great big amen he was wigged crowned by the Angels did you know that the angel of the Lord follows this message did you know that when a little a young man amen kneels down in prayer under this anointing of this day that the angels are right there for you well praise the Lord I I I feel feel good about right now amen Hebrews 1:13 it says but to which of the Angels said he at any time sit on my right hand until I make thine enemies thy footstool are they not all ministering Spirits sent forth to minister for not to for them who shall be hirs of Salvation you mean I ain't going to get a standing ovation for that the angels are sent to minister for somebody say for there's one thing to minister to there's one thing to give to there's another thing for you to be in command and tell me to go do something for [Applause] you one thing to say Amen I I need your help and I minister to you it's another thing to stand with the message of the hour under the token of the [Applause] [Music] word I I just don't believe that kind of authority well that's the reason why you're where you're at you've got your old Pentecostal ideology and you're sitting in a message Church and that's the reason why you're trying to look for something else to get your faith to going the seventh Angels message was to restore the perfect word with the perfect [Applause] Faith hallelujah what if the Angels do the Angels the angels are at his beckoning word the Angels do what his command says the come on now the angels are there to fulfill well let's just read it there in in in let's see Psalms 103 and 20 amen it says bless the Lord ye angels that excel in strength that do his Commandments what does that mean come on he sent an angel to visit Daniel the angel went at his command he sent an angel to visit Peter in the prison he was there to do his command hallel well come on church but the sons are coming into author whatsoever you say the faith that is to return to the ch church it's not what the preacher says it's what you say if you say to this mountain be thou removed and cast into the sea and you don't out your words you can have whatsoever you're still a mortal you're still a human but you've got all of Heaven backing you up you've got the Angels backing you up this is the manifestation of the sons of God in this [Applause] season can you say Amen you when the devil was coming against Jesus brother brandham says he didn't even he didn't even raise a finger come on brother Brandon says I'm going to teach the sons where Jesus was saying I'm going to teach the sons how to defeat the Devil any place any time under any condition I'm going to teach [Applause] them oh we got to get some tongue talkers oh we got to get some prophesizes oh we got to get somebody to see a vision over me all you've got to have is a faith in the the word and if God wants to speak in tongues he'll do it and if God wants to show a vision he'll do it but it's going to be your faith not in a Gifted Man not in a gifted promise or woman but it's going to be in the word of eternal life [Applause] right can you say Amen the [Applause] Angels now bless the Lord ye angels that excel in strength and do his Commandments hearkening unto the voice oh of his word can I have the cloud back up again no keep wait just a minute huah bless ye the Lord all ye hosts oh yeah ye Ministers of his that do his pleasure now Papa was the god of the Universe I was telling I was telling the church on Father's Day really Genesis was not the founding of a religion on it was a story of a king and a prince and his wife who was told I want you to take Dominion ship I want you to take authority over all of this Earth I'm the Lord I'm the Creator I'm the god over the universe but I've given you Authority I'm giving you authority over planet Earth I'm giving you Authority well glory to God I'm giving Hallelujah and when God brought the church back Amen in the book of Acts it started out that way and then Satan came in come on Hallelujah but God says I'm going to have some Sons I'm going to have some Sons they're not going to be sons of denomination they're not going to be sons of opinion they're not going to follow whims amen of this and that and the other they're going to stand upon my word and my word alone and I will back their words [Applause] up you see how important it is for us preachers to preach the message sir not your interpretation of the message just preach it the way brother bradam preached it the government she'll be upon his shoulders if you put that cloud back up the headship that's the head coming down brother brandom says now that's in the that's in the form aen of the Capstone he said the Capstone the the pyramid was never capped he said it was a type of the church that's been headless for all of these times but the headship is coming and the glory of the Lord is coming to Earth to God what he put Let me let me just read some some quotes he says he's proving himself by his word he's still alive he's still here th this word is God you believe it amen he says and then this word is allotted here for this day there's got to be somebody come by that that word can become quickened and make that word to live can I hear an amen he goes on down in the same message no more than Joseph could help being who he was someone shout hallelujah no more than the Pentecostals could help being who they were lutherans couldn't help being who they were I canot help being who I [Music] am I'm coming in this prayer line and I'm going to believe God for the impossible when you come in this prayer line you believe God for the impossible we're not a bunch of Pentecostal babies we are sons of God we are and we are declaring to the enemy that our faith shall possess the gates of our enemy I'm going to possess the Gate of cancer I'm going to possess the gates of diabetes I'm going to possess the [Applause] gates can you say amen he said Joseph couldn't help be who he was look at those four Patriarchs Abraham Isaac Jacob and Joseph Abraham election Isaac calling Jacob Grace Joseph Perfection nothing against him that was God working his way out what Luther Wesley Pentecost and the Capstone when the church and the word becomes the same the same thing exactly everything in the mathematics of the Bible perfectly sets us [Applause] Hallelujah can you say Amen what am I doing I'm acting because Authority The Authority has rested upon [Applause] me I'm acting because the wi one has came to Earth to cap off his [Applause] [Music] [Applause] sons can you say Amen isn't that show him standing there Wicked by angel's wings he is Alpha and Omega he's the Supreme judge there is none other but him he is to look upon his Alpha and Omega can I share another Glory happening in our day can I get can I have a little bit more time let's let's do the let's do the other picture the first picture of brother brandom just preaching Hallelujah another happening in our time as brother brandom is preaching amen and many of times while the preachers many many of times there could be an anointed preacher up here here and you don't see the [Music] Angels because you said you set dead in your unbelief because you want somebody to entertain [Music] you and because your church Ser because the church service that you're in they're not running the aisles then you say the presence of God is Not There whoever said running the aisles is is a manifestation whoever come on now I have a right to say that because I'm

not cast out Devils have we not performed Miracles have we not done these things in your name and Jesus is going to say because you refused the headship of the word I will say I never knew you so when

the picture wasn't taken in the first age second age third age fourth age fifth age sixth age it was taken in your age [Applause] amen now he says now praise the Lord God I'm fixing to we're fixing to

going to go they can take these robots and they'll do anything and they're heartless they they can do anything artificial intelligence right now we have the capability of creating evil bionic men artificial intelligence but brother Bram says now when that kind always happens on the earth in the natural to show what's taking [Applause] place about the time when the prophet was here on the earth in the Hubble Space Shuttle or the Hubble Space and and and and and those big old telescopes and those things were com it it was they were they were going coinciding together because there was an eye God's eyes were on the earth there were eyes that could see beyond what you could see eyes that could go way on Beyond eyes that could tell you Way Back 50 years ago eyes that could tell you what was in God's mind before the foundation of the world eyes that could see beyond can you say amen hallelujah the eyes but the eyes are no longer with us the prophet is in the grave that prophetic gift the eyes are gone brother bradam says there's nothing left beyond the eyes except for the intelligence itself there's nothing left than Christ to move in his church and live his life through [Music] you that didn't happen in the Pentecostal age it come to this bride [Music] age can you say Amen now he says down through the age Christ revealed in his own word 65 he says we've started off from the foundation amen the first church age when the seed went into the ground the complete seed it came through the feet Luther came then through Wesley then into Pentecostal the tongues and the lips and now it's in the eye the prophetic of Malachi 4 and so forth and there's nothing else left for it to come won't you punch your neighbor and said don't be going to sleep yet not too hard they might get you back there's nothing left to come are you now it's the eyes the prophetic of Malachi 4 and so the Pentecostals was the tongues and the lips and now it's the eyes 1965 Heen the eyes of Malachi 4 and so forth and there's nothing else left for it to come but him himself to step into that because that the last thing there is you going to have to hit them harder they weren't listening we want to go back and say I wish I could talked with brother brandom how many times have any of you all said I wish I wish I could sit before brother brandom I wish he could discern my situation I wish brother Brandon could could just come and amen I just wish brother I've been there many of times where I thought God if I could just set amen just a few minutes before and tell and get get get something amen

have no intelligence of our own it's his we have no sight of our own how can no man foresee how can a man foresee these things he can't it's God in him God himself it's coming to a place he's governed the body all the way through and then to the complete body of Christ is revealed in the form of a bride which was taken from his side like Adam did at the beginning you can't see with your hands yet it's part of your body you can't see with the ears yet you can hear you can't see with the nose yet it smells you can't see with the lips though it speaks that was the Pentecostal age but now is the eye time to see and the next is the intelligence which Christ itself who controls the whole body amen do you understand why brother Bon would say I must decrease that he may increase I must God had to pull the bride out because or or the prophet away because they had to be Sons not son Sons with the authority the window I'm not worthy I'm not worthy who said you were worthy in the first place it's the lamb that has been interceding the whole time it's the lamb who come and took the book it's the lamb who ripped the seals off it's the lamb who sent the word to the prophet it's the lamb who anointed the prophet to speak to you it's the lamb that says take the book and eat it can you say amen he says now we've come to the Head the Capstone Grace Grace Capstone cried The Headstone crying

whatsoever he said the high priest is interceding upon your thank you Lord confession but you can only say what the word says in order to get the angels to respond the wigged one the Angels Came

priest of our faith amen the Apostle the sent one God sent one God's anointed one the one that God sent to represent him on the earth come on Amen Jesus was not an apostle Jesus was the Apostle of your faith he was sent on the behalf of God he acted on the behalf of God to search you out and to redeem you the lost son and to reveal to you that great faith you had in him before the foundation of
