babies born in the world brings hope [Music] didn't use a sck oh she's so happy this morning really the only way we can dedicate our children to the Lord is by raising them in the fear and admonition of the Lord but we give them back to the Lord like Hanah gave Samuel back to God and we're dedicating this baby this family is dedicating this baby back to the Lord for a life of service if he terries that she would be a worker in the kingdom of God let's bow our heads together Heavenly Father we thank you Lord that you blessed this family with a lovely little girl Victoria Jane I pray God that you would just move in this family and that you would protect her from sickness that you would give her Lord strength to be a a good Christian Lord if you T when she gets older that she'd be a worker in your kingdom father thank you for the blessings that you give us by giving us children we know that they're only borrowed from you for a time I pray that you'd bless this family give them wisdom Lord Virginia and Joel give them wisdom to teach her in the right way Lord as you told Abraham that you trusted him you knew that he would raise his children right may it be so with this family Lord may she always be in the house of the Lord or never depart we pray in Jesus name amen God bless you she didn't even cry good [Applause] job amen amen do you love the Lord this morning let's Stand Together what a blessing our children are Brother Paul's good to see you this morning been praying for him for so long and it's good to have brother JT and Sister cledith Sister Fritz back with us today and all of you that are here and and good to see U every every one of you you know if I don't see you on Sunday morning uh I know there's a reason but I always look and think what a blessing it is to be able to see you again we're not guaranteed anytime so we have to take advantage of the time that we have right and it doesn't matter how old or how young you are you never know when'll be your last time that you'll be able to meet together and so we take these opportunities and cherish them because we know God has allowed us to be here what a blessing it is to be alive and you know it'd be wonderful to be home as be saying about this morning and that sounds like home to me some of the trouble that we go through and the sorrow and the anguish of life teaches us that there's a better place there must be a better place but at the same time we have joy in our journey here because we know that he's with us and we know we're going there we're not staying here this isn't the end no matter what we go through we don't have to despair because this is not all there is there's more I'm so grateful for that today aren't you there's more and if you lose a loved one you know you're going to see them again at home amen amen let's bow our heads together Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for the children that you've given us in this church I pray that you'd bless each and every one of them for the elderly for the middleaged Lord we thank you for each one I pray Lord that you would heal those that are in need Lord of healing father for all of us we want that second wind as brother Aaron talked about last week oh God would you just come Lord every service we need that Lord we need to receive that when from you that that touch of the Holy Spirit I pray that you'd give it to us today Father help me to say the things that need to be said and nothing else Lord and help me to get out of the way as our brother prayed earlier Lord that you might be able to speak today we ask it in Jesus name amen let's turn to Isaiah chapter 8 and verse 22 we'll continue reading chapter 9 veres 1 and two and then in chapter 60 of Isaiah vers 1 and two I want to title this this morning the shadow of his wings says and they shall look unto the Earth and behold trouble and darkness and dimness of Anguish and that word dimness in the original is is uh actually that word means Gloom dimness of Anguish and they shall be driven to Darkness isn't that the world that we live in today it says nevertheless the dimness shall not be such as was in her vexation when at the first he lightly Afflicted the land of zebulun and the land of Napal afterward did more grievously afflict her by way of the sea Beyond Jordan in Galilee of the Nations the people that walked in darkness have seen a great light they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death upon them the light shined and then in Isaiah 60 and 1 Isaiah 60 and verse1 arise that word is stand up stand up shine it means to be on fire stand up Let Your Light Shine for thy light is come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee for behold the darkness shall cover the Earth and gross darkness and that word is the same word it's Gloom shall cover the people but the Lord shall arise upon thee and His glory shall be seen upon thee I pray the Lord would add his Blessing to the word you may be seated this morning thank you to those of you the ministers here whove helped me over the last few weeks I feel a whole lot better today and and it's good to have some rest but it's good to be back in in the saddle the English word Gloom comes from the word Gloom or gloaming it's an old word that's only kept alive in poetry today but means the time after Sunset and before dark we would call it Twilight it's where we get the word Gloom it means total or partial Darkness dimness also means a state of melancholy or depression Low Spirits and I think we've all been in that state of Gloom have don't we at some point or another in our lives we've been there and it it's dimness and and that's what it we in the verse we read it was dimness translated dimness Gloom or gross Darkness a Gloom a lowering Sky a thick dark cloud and it's mentioned zebulun and Napal that's two tribes of the 12 tribes of Israel and if you look at a map of the 12 tribes but David there's uh at the top is zebulun and Napal or Napal at the top to and then zebulun and you look and there's the Assyrian Empire on the other side and the Assyrians would come down through those two tribes every time they wanted to attack Samaria or Jerusalem that was the way that they would come it was their Road and so Living On the Border they were always in a constant dread of invasion there was always a fear that that there was something coming they they could they could sense it that there was destruction coming there was a a sense of that destruction and isn't that like the country that we live in today there there's a sense of Destruction on the people there's an expectation of Doom and so it brings Gloom on the people it causes them to be in a state of gloominess a state of Darkness because they don't understand uh what it is that they're what's coming and and that's why the dark is so much scarier than the day because you can't see what's out there you don't know what's coming but he said during this time he said your light has come because you see you're able to see and if you're able to see you're able to get away from it right and so but the world is gloomy today and it's kind of a little bit of a gloomy day today outside in the weather but when it happens it it makes you feel a little bit gloomy and it's kind of that way in the world just in general you get around people you feel gloomy you begin to look at the things that are happening in the earth and the way people live it makes you gloomy if you're not careful but remember they have an expectation to be destroyed but that's not our expectation you see he said to those who lived in darkness those who lived in the shadow of death those who lived right in that line where the Assyrians would come in those who live maybe in this country where we know it's bound for Doom but he said they saw a great light and when Jesus come he went to that country and begin to heal the sick and begin to manifest the word the light to those people and it said that fulfill that scripture we'll get to that later but it but it talks about that and how and see we've lived in a time when the word has been manifested in our midst and we've seen that the Gloom has been dispelled but what they needed they they were looking for Destruction but what happened is Messiah came and he did not deliver them in a political way right and our deliverance today is not in a political sense it's not in a political realm we're not looking for deliverance from the Democrats or the Republicans what are we looking for deliverance from from our King coming back right and we've seen the light of the hour to be able to know that we're not looking for these other things we we've seen God come down and walk among us right now they were constantly expecting to be destroyed and I think that Spirit gets on people in the message sometimes it gets on us sometimes if we'd be honest about it a constant expectation of Destruction a constant expectation well there's there's hard times coming there's tribulation coming yes there is but that's not your message brother Brandon preaches the message Shalom and he talks about peace he said I'm going to speak to the elect now I'm going to speak to that group that's going to escape these things I'm not going to speak just to the world he said but I'm going to speak to you there's gross Darkness on the people but Rise and Shine for your light has come you're expecting something different our expectations are not of Doom and Gloom but our expectation is of of Christ returning in our midst amen the word being manifested where right in our own midst random says this in the breach he said our national spirit is frolic jokes he said you know why we were founded upon the doctrine of the Apostles we were founded upon leadership of great in like Washington and Lincoln we have moved off that foundation and we know that we've got it coming we know that an atomic bomb has got our name wrote on it we know that slavery lay lays ahead of us he said no need of fooling yourself he said It reminds me like some of these comedians going down and telling these jokes and carrying on women carrying on the way they do and Men together he said it just reminds me of a little boy going through the graveyard whistling trying to make himself believe he's not scared sure he's scared he said see he ain't fooling nobody that's why he's whistling he's trying to say that he's not scared but he is he said and that's what's the matter today but oh what a blessed hope for the believer that's lifting up hands for our Redemption is drawing nigh he said when he sees these things appearing it's a great time for the believer why because he doesn't have an expectation of Destruction has an expectation of life let me tell you that's why it's so important to go to the house of the Lord that's why it's so important we need to be reminded of what our expectation is we need to be reminded of what our hope is we need to be able to give an answer for the hope that lays within us it's important to be in the house of God it's important to hear the word of the lord it's important to hear the message of the hour and to read it and to find out what God said why because we know we're living in a time of Doom and Gloom and destruction and that spirit will get on you and we got and I'm not preaching at any of you this morning I'm preaching at me that spirit will get on you to where you feel like everything's going wrong everything's bad and you're constantly in a state of uh drama and a state of of trouble and a state of confusion but we know where we stand I got to reading about what brother said about gloomy he said it was a gloomy morning when the uh when the three Hebrew children were taken there to be put in the fiery furnace but they found out there was was an Fourth Man In The Fire amen they didn't have an expectation of Destruction they said our God is able to deliver us but even even if he doesn't says we're not going to Bow of your image their expectation was of Deliverance that's what our expectation has to be today amen if we go back into Genesis 1 we see a world created and then something happen happens now Genesis 1:1 says in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth period now something happens because then in verse two it says and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters notice how gloomy it must have been and yet the spirit of God was moving in that darkness and I want you to think about this some of you have been through some tough times but JT but in that Gloom there there's light the the the logos was there are you hearing me today the logos was there in that Gloom the word the Loos the Son of God moved the Holy Spirit moved across the face of the waters in in amongst that Gloom he was moving for some purpose amen now brother Bram says I was talking to a person not long ago was trying to discuss with me and saying aren't you ashamed to say that God created the heavens and earth in three days dur in six days I said that's what the Bible said he said well we got evidence to can prove the world is millions of years old I said that didn't have anything to do with it in Genesis 1:1 he said in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth period That's all see he said now the world was without form and void and I said I believe every seed was laying right there from some other civilization or something and as soon as the water lifted off and the light Struck it up come the trees and everything it was there but it was in a gloomy condition and brother Brandon makes a statement he said I was in a gloomy condition until I met Christ why because he is the light without the presence of the light there's chaos now the light was the manifested word of God brother Bri and SS it is the rising of the sun he said well there was a time when the world was laying in utter Darkness it was without form and was void was all covered with water was laying there in the dark dismal gloomy atmosphere huh listen that's the natural state of people who are waiting on destruction and here was a world that somehow there had been destruction there was there was trouble there was Darkness it was bloomy but there was a light coming amen it be it was manifested at the time of the spoken word now look it was without form it was covered in that gloomy atmosphere and the spirit of God moved upon that water and said let there be light he said God had a reason to do that for down beneath that water there was seeds that he had planted amen and it had to have that sunlight to make it live don't you realize that's what he's done in our hour amen we're not just waiting on the manifestation of the light but the light is come in our hour right Shine for your light has come why is it come the message of the Hour come be for a purpose why because there were seeds that he had planted that was in this gloominess in this darkness of denominational ages brother B said where they just had enough to join a church just enough light to be able to form a denomination he said but in that Gloom in that Darkness God began to manifest his light when he manifested the light all of a sudden all the season that had planed begin to grow it had to have the sunlight to make it live let me tell you something I you know there are people who will make it and good people and I believe this that will make it some perhaps even just by the way they treat you there will be people who will make it just that way but that's not for us now look we need the message of the hour we've heard heard so there's people that'll make it in but the Skin of Their Teeth whatever maybe at that raised in that that second Resurrection where they're you know they stand there at the judgment and and maybe some a member of the Bride will say something for them stand for them but I don't want to be there I I want to be in the first resurrection now how do I get in that first resurrection this sunlight that has come I can't do without the message of the hour as the bride I have to have it because it is the the manifestation of the word now let me tell you it's more than just words on a page but the message when it becomes material when it becomes a life when it really gets in your heart it becomes a life and when it does it manifest the word so you become the manifestation of the light are you with me now now he he said let there be light and God had a reason to do that Genesis 1:3 God said let there be light and there was light and God saw the light that it was good and God divided the light from the darkness God called the light day in the darkness he called night in the evening and the morning were the first day now that was what the word did when it was manifested divides light from darkness no Gloom in that right because the Gloom is that time when you can't tell if it's light or dark but it divides the light in the darkness now when the word was made flesh and I'm laying an extensive background to get to a simple thought this morning but when the word was made flesh the darkness had to go Matthew 4:12 when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison he departed into Galilee leaving Nazareth he come and dwelt in capernium which is upon the Sea Coast in the borders of zabulon and nephalem that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by is the prophet saying the land of zebulin and the land of nepon by the way of the sea Beyond Jordan Galilee of the Gentiles the people which set in darkness saw great light to them which said in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up in the region of death in that place where there was an expectation of Darkness light sprung up from that time Jesus began to preach and to say repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand brother Rand said when he come he was the light of the day there was supposed to come a messiah and he came just exactly like God said he did would come when he did what was he the light of the day and it pressed the darkness so against him it pressed the darkness so against him the devil hated him he was persecuted why because he was so much light it pressed the darkness amen we talk about the darkness pressing us but it's actually us pressing the darkness the light presses the darkness now look he said he had to give his life that the light continue could shine he was the light of the day but why why was he the light of the day he was the Vindicated word that had been spoken made manifest amen God said over this dark gloomy dismal Mossy world that stood here without light he said let there be light amen and it wasn't light until that word was manifested and then it was light now this happens in every one of our Lives when the word begins to be manifested in our lives then it's light there darkness and gloomy and dismal and mosy let there be light and there's light manifested now he said there will come a savior a messiah it still wasn't manifested until he come to manifest that promise and when he Vindicated that promise he said search the scriptures for them you think you have eternal life they are they that testify of me and they said we not we know not when th comest we are moses' disciples he said if you were Moses disciples you would know me for Moses wrote of me see he was the manifestation he was the Vindication of the spoken word of God by Moses now look God spoke a word in Malachi 4 he said behold I sent you Elijah the prophet that word didn't become light until Elijah came right and when Elijah came then what do we have we have a manifestation of the word said let there be light and there was light there was light that's the manifestation let there be light it's the spoken word there was light that's the manifestation behold I sent you Elijah the Prophet Elijah the prophet came now Elijah the prophet said there will be a bride right he said you had a a wedding band of Grace slipped on you over there he said that you're the pure virtuous sinless bride of Jesus Christ the word was spoken when does it become light when it's manifested every time we go to church every time we go to the grocery store every time to the S we work in in the factory whatever it is that you do every time you go over the Harvey around people you become the manifestation of the light of the hour you become the answer to God's question or the answer to the to the statement that was made to the prophecy you become the Fulfillment of the prophecy when he says let there be light and there was light let there be a bride and there is a bride see there's got to be one and that's why we don't take the Doom and Gloom of people say well the bride's washed up well it was good 30 years ago it's not good no I don't believe that because if it was ever going to be a bride it's got to be one today he did not fail to produce a bride without spot or wrinkle but see so many times we look at the outside we look at the flesh we look at what's going on on the outside and we don't see but the steward that he is still produced the bride and it may not be perfect to the world but it's perfect to him amen amen you are the manifestation he was the manifestation he was the Vindication of the spoken word of God by Moses he said today that we're now living in God has come on the scene to vindicate and prove his promises so it's the light of the hour listen so we can rise and shine amen it's the light of the hour what did he say rise and shine for your light has come your light not not Wesley's light not Luther's light your light has come the people that lived in darkness saw a great light your light has come what was it the word amen the word Christ has come that same logos that was there in the darkness but one day it become light that word became alive when was revealed in our day not a man but a word that become alive amen so it's the light of the hour so we can rise and shine amen as song say rise and shine there's a new day of dawning amen the voice that you hear is your voice calling what is it rise and shine it's your turn it's your time to be made manifest and we know that we've heard that now so the word of this day manifested in you is the light that dispels the Gloom of the hour in Zechariah 14:6 it speaks of this said it shall come to pass on that day that the light shall not be clear nor dark and it shall be one day which will be known to the Lord not day nor night but it shall come to pass that at evening time it shall be light he said well we're looking for that no we've seen that brother brand says watch the same son that rises in the East it's the same Sun that sets in the west Su the same holy spirit that fell on the day of Pentecost in the East he said now it's been a day it could not be called a day it's a Gloom a gloomy day rainy said you see it here in Kansas rainy gloomy wintertime darkness when it shouldn't be dark Twilight Gloom gloaming a time when it's not light or dark and you just have enough light he said we've had enough light to join Church Church do these things like to get around in listen if if this message doesn't become alive to you if you don't receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit if it don't become real to you that's where you live right you you'll live even though the light's there but if it doesn't become real and become manifested to you you'll live in that darkness in that Gloom in that evening time though he said it would be light he said and the sun would return again he said and the Holy Spirit returning in this last days with the fullness again of God's power he said the word made manifest the word being made manifest now we know that happened in a prophet but it happens in The Bride it has to brother Brown said we become light of the air now in this time the understanding of the people of the world is darkened we know that you know when it's dark you can't get around very well I like to sleep in the dark I don't like to walk around in it right now I like it to be dark when I sleep I had a brother older brother and we had a a chair to room and and uh Sam always wanted the dart or the light on and I always wanted it off so we for for several years we fought about that every night he'd turn it on I'd turn it off he'd turn it on I'd turn it off he'd wake up and it was dark and he'd get up and turn back on but I don't like walking around in the dark if you got to get up and and and your wife's rearranged the furniture you're going to stub your toe in the dark why because the dark there there's no Revelation in the dark right it's hard to get around in that that's where people live just enough light to join Church enough light to to do that but not enough light to actually make it live make it real but there's one day but the PA that word becomes alive you begin to realize this is for me amen and when that light comes all of a sudden the the things you couldn't have lived through before you find yourself making it through all of a sudden it don't seem like it's so gloomy why you go through the same things you have the same troubles you have the same trials the world does but there's something inside of you something that keeps holding you something that keeps working in you what is it you're becoming the manifested word of the hour but the world out here is darkened to that now Ephesians 4:17 he said this I say therefore and testify in the Lord that you henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind now you look in that darkness and Chaos in the beginning the word of God couldn't take shape or form so we didn't know what a family looked like right because it was just seeds laying out there we didn't know what a lion would look like or tiger even what light would look like there just nothing there but it was in God's mind now God has a very specific way and we call them the laws of God it's just like the law of gravity that's a law of God a natural law right God created it and if you pick something up it's going to fall because it's the law of gravity or certain laws that are things that are true right we live in a world that's been influenced by something called post postmodernism which means that they believe that there's nothing that you can really say is true everything is relative there's no no nothing better than something else well there's a reason why we put benches on the ground not hung up in the air right because you can't just float up to them there's a law holding you down you rely on that law all the time there's a law that says that if you get in your car if you turn the key a certain thing happens an electrical charge goes somewhere and certain Pistons do a certain thing and and they figured out how to make that law work to move a car down the road they didn't create that they're just harnessing the laws of God right this electricity was already in in the atmosphere but they harness that and made light right even when it's gloomy outside and so those are IM mutable laws of God we live in a in a time when the Gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind in other words they just make it up they imagine it well you don't have to be married to a woman you can marry who whatever you want well it's against the laws of God number one it don't work you can't have children right it's impossible you you understand what I'm saying it's impossible for it to work you said well we'll just make a society where everybody loves everybody you can do whatever you want no it don't work like that right because it's in the vanity of their mind it says having the understanding darkened the understanding the ability to even see the laws of God and how they operate and so it's a world that's so Twisted that it makes you look like you're strange right and you've even got family some of you have been around family this week you got family who make fun of you for being a Christian who mocked you because you don't want to listen to that you don't want to hear that you don't want to see that you don't want to dress like that and and there's people that will do that and in the world there's people I don't know how many times my wife has been maybe to a yard cell or something and some lady will sit there and usually an older lady will sit there and say well why don't you just cut that hair off it's too hot it just bothers them why but it's the way it's supposed to be right but it's odd to the world because their understanding is darkened they're living in that sense that chaos they're living in that Darkness being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them Paul said it this way in Romans he said professing to be wise they become fools and they're educated idiots educated ignor animus but they're still ignoramuses that's a word they're still ignorant right because of the blindness of their hearts they don't feel bad about that and and brother random in Shalom he says something that really struck me he said you know he said I don't he said I used to feel bad about those people he said but I realize they're in darkness he said they don't know any better but thank God for the light he said through the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness of their heart don't you see that and and see people young people grow up in the message and say well if I just had if I could just go and that Satan tells you the same lie he does Eve if I could just go in the world and experience those things I would have more light I'd be happier I would be less gloomy and not realizing that it actually is what brings Darkness who being now look past feeling other words God can't even touch them anymore they can't be affected by what they're doing they have no conscience being past feeling have given themselves over unto lusciousness to work all uncleanness with greediness brandom uses the example of people not knowing what gender they belong to and Shalom he said I've noticed amongst men he said look out on the streets and he said most amongst the women watch their desires what they like to do he said and they're changing attitudes all the time amen men are becoming more like women women are becoming more like men and it seems like there's no way to stop it he said I cross a nation preaching against the thing come back the next year and it's worse than it was when I started he said it's then people want to do right but there's something about it won't let them do right he said it just presses down on them forces them it's like a heavy dark fog over the whole earth he said not only in Phoenix but all over the world there seems to be just a grouping Darkness that's Gathering getting more dense and dense all the time just smothering out real manhood real Womanhood we've seen that grow up and become mature where now they allow a man to marry a man woman to marry a woman there's no hope for this country for this world Darkness on every side he said but arise and shine for your light has come he said Shalom to the bride for the elect there is peace you say well I love this he said you say well I just tell you brother bandam I can't look ahead you ever felt like that I can't see anything ahead that's going to be good you see baby's born Victoria Jane I got that name right three times this morning born into a world these babies being born into a world of Darkness you look at that you begin to look at what's going on you think I don't know if we can make it I don't know what kind of world to be raised in it's discouraging you can't look ahead he said then look up amen the promise for your children didn't go away because of the darkness are you hearing me this morning look up I can't look ahead look up God promised if you look up see him amen you said if I could just see a bunch of people in the church if I could just see a pastor if I could just no don't look at that look up God promised if you look up and see him Shalom peace God's peace rests you amen but this gloominess this constant gloominess on the nation on the world affects us just like we're affected by the weather outside we feel the spirit of gloominess caused by the deformity of Satan's Eden gloomy that Darkness Brandon ministered to people affected by this I want to talk about it in the natural for just a moment in 1950 the R's in a prayer line he talks to a man then we'll talk about a woman as well he spoke to he said but he said Do You Believe Me Brother he said you believe it will you obey me as this servant now he said you want to be healthy have all that weary and gloomy and crazy feeling like you're losing your mind things like that he said no I tell you where that started on the prostate now we could get very involved in this but I just tell you that if you've had something traumatic in your life especially sickness or a loss of someone that you love it can produce a feeling of gloominess can produce a a crazy feeling that's natural you you take a woman after she's had a baby she kind of gets that a little bit it's just natural or something in their body you take a woman that's lost a baby how much more gloomy feeling a crazy feeling like you're losing your mind and that's why sometimes I don't know why I'm talking about this this morning but you just bear with me a woman brother BR talked about the adopted baby route he said that if if you would adopt a baby he said you let a woman adopt a baby that can't have one after a while she'll have one because there's something about it that them and calms them and plus they're busy taking care of the baby right and so he said you get that gloomy crazy feeling usually that stems from something with this man was prostate trouble but yet what it did it didn't create it it but it made it those things that he'd always been dealing with maybe it always dealt with depression gloominess but it made it worse right it just things bad that happened to you make you more the way you are not less right it brings out more of what you are good and bad things many times and so when you get gloomy and you begin to feel like that and you get certain things that run in families and I'll say that for my family not I got several family members here this morning but we get that we we struggle with depression just my dad did and and going back but if there's something that happens then traumatic in your life it just makes that that much worse and and then it just keeps going down H but brother Brandman I'm not reading this whole quote you can go back and read it he deals with this man at length he said but what really is doing it it's a demon he said it haunts you he said isn't that right you have no peace at all day and night it's after you seems like you just skip gloomy feelings in there is that right yes they're weary don't sleep nervous getting up at night brother BR prays for the man he tells him about an incident in his teens that happened and then he tells him about something he tells him off the mic and he tells him something about when he was a child he said when you was a child a little boy with knee pants on you've got problems with something he said I believe it's a dog that chased you a big dog he said you run to a porch you think God didn't speak in our day all the videos on the internet they don't deal with stuff like this they get on there and say oh brother Bron missed it here and he missed it there and they can't prove anything but what they try to do is make you doubt huh but but they don't go to stuff like this because you know well brother brandham someone even say brother brandham was a prophet well why would God call the the gift the ministry that was unique to him since as far as we know since the time of Christ that that had not come on a man and God called him and he was false it doesn't make any sense even the reasonable explanation is that God must have had something to say right he said I believe in it's a dog that chased you or something a big dog you run to a porch that's right I see it as a little boy is that the truth he said now he goes on he said now look here sir it's gone now you're free you go out of here testifying you feel all right now fine wonderful he said that's go out of here rejoicing testifying he said now if I could tell you what happened to you when you was a little boy down to the age down to where you are right now the life that you live the things that you've done that was true wasn't it every word true he said now I will tell you what will be the results in the coming future amen but now listen the the results hinged on his faith right it hinged on his ability to shake that but the thing is he had the ability to shake it but the light needed to be shined on it are you hearing me now because the light dispelled the Gloom amen you want to quit being gloomy look into the word of God we get to look at the word and we get to see what the word says I can't tell you I can say shake it off go you can't tell somebody that because you don't know what they've been through you can't feel what they're feeling but if you look at the word of God the word of God is always true and it's a seed that'll produce something in your life it'll manifest in your life and here the word of God is the discerner of the thoughts and tense of the heart it says I will tell you what would be the results in the coming future go out of here happy singing testifying telling people God healed you how many of us are prayed for like that because it's always true right brother Bram was say you're healed you're healed what he said I was just telling him what the word says some of them may have left the platform and died brother Brown says you're healed because that's what the word says by Stripes I'm Healed so when I come to be prayed for I don't leave and say well I wish I'd had been healed while I was up there you already healed right you come and and stood according to the word of God the prayer of faith shall save the sick you believe that and you leave rejoicing happy testifying telling people God healed you he said you he said forget you ever was nervous amen amen 30 days from now I love this this isn't just just positive thinking but it's actually something that works according to the law of God and in that light you can see a tree right in that light you can see that the seeds are becoming what they are in that light you can see what the holy spirit is doing but as long as that Gloom is there you can't see nothing but when you begin to look at it by the Light of the word I'm already healed I'm already I'm already saved God's already he's elected me to be a part of his bride when you begin to see things according to the light of the word there's no Gloom that can stand against that light forget you ever was nervous 30 days from now you will be a different man alt together see Darkness spreads Gloom spreads but so does light brother R was asked a question about a lady who has a dream you all know the the the where I'm referencing in questions and answers she's lost in White Sands dream troubles her and she thinks she's lost because of the dream and the dream was actually God telling her she was fine huh and brother BR said I don't know the lady but I just feel if you're here lady that here is your trouble you've let something happen to you that's made you nervous because being in White Sands represents Purity and righteous and you're just letting Satan put one over on you your dream proved that there's nothing wrong you're only nervous and see when when you're in in that condition when you're in that gloominess everything looks like something is wrong he said you're only nervous and by doing this and thinking this you're making the rest of your family nervous stop doing it claim your god-given rights amen you may have been through hell and back but you've got rights huh you may have been sick but the problem but you've got rights you can claim those rights you can claim those rights I have a right to be healthy I have a right to be happy I have a right to live according to God I wasn't born brother brother said you were not born to be miserable you were born to be happy and free he said you stop doing it claim your god-given rights you have rights you say well I'm just a a little insignificant person you have rights some people in Boston one day woke up about 250 years ago however long it's been they woke up one day and realized I got some rights I don't have to live under this taxation I don't have to live under this with no representation at all I don't have to live under this I've got a right and then so they wrote a document called the Declaration of Independence that said we've been created with certain inalienable rights it's about time the people of God realize they've got rights not a right to live like the world and do things like that but a right to live for God and a right to be happy and a right to claim every promise of God are you with me now you have God given rights brother BR said your dream proves by the interpretation that you're in white sand everything's all right it's you yourself nervous he said you let one member of the family get nervous it goes to the next member and the next member and the first thing you're all fusting and going on one member of the family gets kind of upset about something it upsets the other and the other and the other first thing you know the whole family is upset it's hard to enjoy that turkey when everybody's upset now that didn't happen at our Thanksgiving so I'm not I enjoyed my turkey but brother BR said it's Satan he said then if one member of the family rejoices I love this let the rest of them Rejoice with it he said so every one of the family try to do that he said try each one of you children to help your papa mama mama you papa you try to help the children don't let that gloomy unbelieving Spirit get around you you are Christians you are born to the spirit of God you're the salt of the earth you have god-given rights amen am man you're you're in White Sands you you've been made pure by the blood of Jesus Christ don't let the devil tell you of course he's going to tell you you're not going to make it what do you think he's going to tell you of course he's going to tell you that you're no good of course he's going to tell you to be gloomy of course he wants you to not let the light shine through your life of course he wants you to be that way but you don't have to be that way you have rights you're the salt of the earth you have god-given rights and the Bible said if there be any praise if there be any virtue think on these things don't think about the wrong thing he said and sister I think that's your trouble each one of us men and women could benefit from thinking about the right things brother BR preached Shalom he read two scriptures he read Isaiah 61 and2 and he read Psalm 62 1-8 which doesn't seem to really connect I'll get to my sermon after a while and and it says this it says truly my soul waiteth upon God from him cometh my salvation he only is my rock and my salvation he is my defense I shall not be greatly moved he said how long will you imagine Mischief against a man you should be slain all of you as a bowling bowling I said a bowling ball a Boeing wall that if that was true that would be quite a prophecy for me a bowling ball shall you be you can relax in church it's okay a bowling wall shall you be and a boing wall shall you be a Boeing wall one has fallen down a tottering fence go that next verse they only consult to cast him down from his Excellency he speaking of these these out here in darkness they Delight in lies they bless with their mouth but they curse inwardly the next verse my soul wait thou only upon God for my my expectation is from himen remember they were expecting judgment but my expectation is from God he only Is My Rock Amen and my salvation he is my defense I shall not be moved I don't have I got a right to stay here I've got a right see David when he went to Jerusalem he realized that was that was going to be David's City he had a right to that land Joshua had given them that land but the jebusites had built a defense there a strong tower and what did David do he didn't sit there and say well it's too strong we can't do it he said let me find a man that can figure out how to get in because we know it's ours and so they found a way to get in and they and they tore down the city what does the New Testament say casting down imaginations every stronghold of the enemy everything every High thing that would exalt itself against the the the word of God what is it he is the rock of my strength my refuge is in God I have a right to to be here a right to stand he says in God is my salvation and my glory and he says he only is my rock and my salvation he is my defense I shall not be moved and God is my salvation my glory Rock of my strength and my refuge is in God trust in him at all times you people pour out your heart before him God is a refuge for us a refuge now the idea is that during this time of Darkness we're protected he's preaching Shalom peace your light has come and this Psalm was actually when David is waiting he's waiting there to be uh in the cave to be for Saul to come and get him Saul's after him but he said trust in him at all times you people pour out your heart before him David didn't anticipate destruction but life the Gloom for you is not the coming Darkness but the coming light are you hear me this morning it's the coming light but the Brom says this he said and and watch this real closely he said you might have lost your health you might have lost your fellowship he said but take him at his word amen be certain that he's God the gloomy times that's looking now may not look so Gloom bloy if you'll just take his word and be certain that he's God and he goes and gives us this illustration he said in Germany once I saw a picture and always stuck with me a German painter has painted a picture that's called the Cloudland when you see it off at a distance it's the horriblest looking Gloom you ever seen just clouds matted together when you're looking at it from a long distance but when you get real close to it it changes it's angel's wings beating together singing Hallelujah to the Lord he said so that's what Gloom is sometimes if you look at it a long distance it looks gloomy and dark but take God at his word and be certain that he's God and listen and move up close to it don't be scared of it move up close to it you'll find out it's just Angels Wings beating together I got to studying on this yesterday and I and I was trying to find the Hebrew word for gloom and it's that word dimness that we read in the first scripture dimness it it's translated several other ways but the same Hebrew word for gloom is also angel's wings it's the same word and the reason is because in the in the Hebrew language it doesn't see a distinction because it's the Gloom cast by being under the shadow of wings I hope you hear me today I just blessed my heart I thought God here's a prophet telling us that if we just get up close to it we'd see that those wings are are just Angels Wings it looks like clouds but it's just Angels wings and here in the Hebrew it means the same thing the cloudiness the Gloom the darkness is comes but you're protected in that see you may not be able to see down the road a long ways it looks gloomy and dark but take God at his word be certain that he's God you're protected so you see the gloominess that covers the earth don't you see that's why the Holy Spirit was moving on the face of the waters and it was still dark but he said let there be light and there was like but what was he doing in the dark protecting the seed brooding over the seed so in the Hebrew they they don't take wings as being just for flight but the primary purpose of wings and you look at birds being in the desert the primary purpose is protection for their young and so they looked at Angels when they talk about the sarpam and the cheram having wings the primary purpose of those wings was not to fly but the primary purpose was protection amen remember he had six wings you only used two of them to fly but the primary purpose of the Wings was protection where are the wings the chair and wings is Over The Mercy Seat the wings cover it's the covering amen amen it covers over The Mercy Seat Hallelujah in there you have the covering of his wings and brother Bram talks about that Gloom he said if you're on the outside he said you're Justified he said you're in that outer Court he said you're Justified but you're subject to the weather he said if it's gloomy you're gloomy if it's gloomy you're gloomy because it's just you're subject to that but if you could ever get inside the holy of holies on the insides where those wings are covering where that presence covers the the mercy see what happens in there there's always light it's protection and so that same word when it says in the beginning when it talks about that the holy spirit moves that word moves is the word for brooding or hovering or fluttering then and and Moses uses it in Deuteronomy where he says as a hin stirreth her nest stirreth flutter over her young what is that that that's the same word brooding covering it looks gloomy but it's covering it's prot protection you see the world has to be the way that it is amen and while we're here yes we'll fly one day but while we're here we have to be protected and the things that you think in your life are gloomy are actually given you for your protection it looks like Gloom but it's actually his wings amen and he Broods over the darkness don't you see you go through times of Darkness yes you we've seen the light yes we have a message but there's times of darkness in your life sure there is there's times when you can't see a way out there's times when you're so sick that you can't see yourself well there's times when you're so hurt that you can't see yourself Ever Getting to a place of happiness again but remember it's during that time when those wings are overshadowing it's during that time you're still under the shelter of his wings it's angel's wings beating together it's the wings of God beating together it's not just Gloom the darkness is just another sign of his protection David says again when he fled from Saul in the cave in Psalm 57 he said be merciful unto me oh God be merciful unto me for my soul trusteth in thee yay in the shadow of thy Wings will I make my Refuge until these calamities be overpassed it's easy to tell somebody to get over it remember you've got Wings to protect you the darkness the gloominess it's just him protecting his children for the brandom tells us the cloudy skies and storms of life are no signs of God's disapproval neither are bright skies and still water signs of his approval or his love but his approval of any of us is only in the Beloved his love is elective Amen brother B says the hour is pressing the darkness is a settling the end time is here one minute before midnight see the presence of the enemy the shaking the feeling the nervous condition don't you see that's where we live today see the presence of the enemy the shaking the feeling the nervous condition the tension of the world not knowing that you're Doom that's the world that's their Doom said oh my let's Mount up with wings as an eagle now fly into the arms of him that's the same yesterday today and forever brother brand was preaching on these things everyone during that time wanted to dig in the ground build a bomb shelter and the prophet told us he said we don't we don't can't dig far enough in the ground to escape what's coming he said we don't need a shelter made of steel we need one made of feathers Amen in the shadow of his wings yes yes it's a shadow but it's the shadow of his wings yes it's a trial yes it's hard but it's the shadow of his wings it's his Providence the tender hand of Jehovah bringing us to the place where we have to be amen so one day we can fight what is he doing he's covering us and all the time taking out the fur and taking out the softness of the nest so we get uncomfortable enough that won't want to fly you can't dig down enough can I say that in a spiritual way today you can't get down enough gloomy enough where you can protect yourself from being hurt you can't do that the only way to escape is to fly go above it that's the anointing of the hour look at the word what does the word say about it Fly Above it it'll be okay it's just wings but the brandom talked about going up Superstition Mountain musicians go ahead and come he talked about going up Superstition Mountain and he said he always wanted to go there there was a lot of spooky stories told about that place so he said they he said he tried to go up with a flashlight and he started his way up he said it just wasn't enough light he scared of what was out in the darkness you've been like like that peering around one of what's coming it's 2020 could be anything right what's coming a Corona virus what's coming are we going to get shut down what's coming a political disaster huh Civil War what's coming it's Darkness he said I realized they didn't have enough light amen the light wasn't big enough but there's a coming day bre bre he said what I learned he said what I had to do he said is just sit still sit down sit still and wait because as soon as the sun come up as it begin to rise the Shadows begin to leave the mountain and what was scary began to be revealed that it was all in God's plan anyway you see the the higher you go and the the higher the sun rises the more you're able to see that these laws of God are working in your life that these things that that's really a tree that was meant for my Shade that's really a a line he wasn't meant to destroy me but he was meant to be my my companion don't you see those things were made for us everything else on the Earth was made for man amen oh aren't you glad today that you could be under the shelter of his wings you don't have to live in a condition of depression you don't have to live in a condition of helpless I know those times come but you don't have to stay there you got rights you can come up out of that get under his wings recognize that you're just the Gloom it may not leave the outside we don't know what's coming on the outside but we know this we're going home amen I may not be able to see everything coming I don't know exactly why we're even still here but I know this I'm going home and until I do until the day that that day star shines and bright bright Over the Horizon until that day I believe I'm under the shadow of his wings may be in a shadow but it's just the shadow of his wings would you bow your heads with me maybe maybe you've struggled with this I know I have it just meant so much to me just let me see that one thing just your wings Lord I may not be able to see it coming but it's just your wings may not it may look like gloom and despair my life doesn't have to be that way because I know things happen for a reason it doesn't just happen randomly there's some purpose to it but I can't see it because of the darkness of light but I look up and see you Lord when I'm certain that I see you I know all all the darkness can be gone in a moment would you just talk to him that way I know I saw an article this morning that more people in the country of Japan had died last month by Suicide than died by Corona virus the whole year because the country's in a state of depression the world is in a state of depression they're medicating you look at at the marijuana sales and all the things that are going up look at Oklahoma they opened it up and now everybody's on medical marijuana everybody's got a card because they just need something to make it through the day there an opioid crisis everybody's taking drugs but I got a pill that's much greater we've got something that that can that can ease our mind something to lift the burden listen when you're gloomy I read where a prophet of God said when you're gloomy he said come unto me that ye that are weary and heavy laden he said that is a manifested word of God that's the word of God as much as the son let there be light come unto me all you that are weary in heavy lad if you'll let that seed grow in your life it'll come to pass in you if you're weary if you're troubled there's a man here who can turn on the light it's not me it's Christ he's here he was revealed in his word by the message of the age now he stands here Among Us he didn't leave he's here with us he's right here Among Us he's walking among us if he's here all the clouds can be dispelled we look at him Heavenly Father Lord we approach this today and even for myself I I needed this Lord I needed to see that the gloominess sometimes is just your wings just protecting me from something I can't see what I want to but it's just your protection Lord we've had a
