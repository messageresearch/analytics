[38:49] and it's based on the scriptures all of
[38:51] our life you say well that my particular
[38:52] situation is different but there's a
[38:54] foundation there that we have if the
[38:56] Holy Spirit if you let the Holy Spirit

[39:00] begin to be different we want to be

[39:14] I want to continue to talk to you about
[39:15] victory in the battle of the Mind talk
[39:18] to you tonight about keeping the victory
[39:20] in the battle of the Mind
[39:22] be careful for nothing
[39:24] in other words don't be anxious about
[39:26] anything
[39:27] but in everything by prayer and
[39:30] supplication with Thanksgiving let your
[39:33] requests be made known unto God
[39:37] and the peace of God
[39:39] which passeth all understanding in other
[39:42] words it'll be there when it shouldn't
[39:44] be
[39:45] there's no reason for the peace of God
[39:47] to be there but it'll be there amen
[39:50] shall keep your hearts notice that word
[39:53] keep so keep your hearts and Minds
[39:56] through Christ Jesus pray the Lord with
[39:58] that is blessing to the word you may be
[40:00] seated
[40:04] we believe in Victory amen we believe
[40:07] that it is possible to have a victory in
[40:11] the battle of the mind you say well I'll
[40:12] always be fighting sure Satan is going
[40:14] to come right back in fact brother
[40:16] Branham tells us uh in that message that
[40:19] we were studying this morning he said
[40:21] but the devil will try to come right
[40:23] back
[40:24] the devil will try to come right back he
[40:27] said if he can get in there at all he's
[40:28] got your army routed right then and so
[40:31] he wants to come back that's his job and
[40:34] and he's good at his job if you look out
[40:36] in the world today nobody's got any
[40:38] peace nobody's got any Joy nobody's got
[40:40] any ability to really really touch uh
[40:44] really have those things at all in their
[40:46] life and just tore up all the time
[40:48] anxious all the time and many times we
[40:51] are too because we fight those same
[40:53] battles but remember Victory Is Possible
[40:56] and the Victory is we found out this
[40:58] morning was not the victory is not
[41:01] necessarily the complete healing but
[41:04] Victory is faith faith is the victory he
[41:07] said faith is the victory over our worry
[41:09] faith is the victory over anxiety faith
[41:12] is the victory over trouble faith is the
[41:14] victory over sickness yeah how many
[41:16] believe that tonight faith is the
[41:18] victory Faith does not bring the victory
[41:20] faith is the victory
[41:23] and so if you think about it's going to
[41:26] be a little bit different tonight maybe
[41:27] but uh just hang with me for a moment if
[41:29] you think about the uh the rings of the
[41:33] Mind The Body Soul and Spirit and you
[41:35] begin to think about those things and
[41:37] you realize that uh that it's like a
[41:40] city as we said this morning there's an
[41:42] outer wall an outer defense and in that
[41:45] defenses five gates that's uh that see a
[41:48] taste feel smelling here and then on the
[41:50] inside is another city and in that City
[41:53] there's five more gates and uh you you
[41:56] have inside of that you've got
[41:58] imagination and reason and affection and
[42:01] memory and all of those things that you
[42:03] don't want to I'm going to switch Mike's
[42:05] here brother Peter all
[42:10] Spirit realm yeah and and so those
[42:13] things I remember at one time you were
[42:16] without any government at all you were
[42:18] you were without any kind of uh any kind
[42:21] of ability to get rid of an anxious
[42:23] thought you you didn't have the ability
[42:25] to have peace in your home you didn't
[42:27] have ability to have peace on the job
[42:29] but now you do
[42:30] now what happened is on the inside so
[42:33] there's an inner wall there's an outer
[42:34] wall but on the inside there's a keep
[42:37] there there's a palace there's a place
[42:40] there's a stronghold and that is the
[42:42] soul and inside of that there's been a
[42:44] new king that's taken up residence on
[42:46] the inside of the inside aren't you glad
[42:49] that you're part of that Kingdom today
[42:52] so if that King is reigning on the
[42:54] inside
[42:55] then it begins to flow out of you if we
[42:58] unstop the flu and and we make sure that
[43:02] all the channels are open Out of You
[43:04] flows love and joy and peace and all
[43:06] those things are you with me so far
[43:09] so you're if you say you're being
[43:12] because that's what Satan is fighting
[43:14] against is you
[43:16] it's a battle for you
[43:18] so your being is a Sovereign Nation
[43:23] not you and your neighbor not you even
[43:25] in your your family but you
[43:28] right you you you're you're a Sovereign
[43:31] Nation
[43:32] and Sovereign Nations cannot keep the
[43:35] peace with an open border policy
[43:39] I'm not talking about politics now
[43:42] but you are you are ruled by the King of
[43:45] Kings is that right right and so you set
[43:48] up borders you uh in these walls that
[43:51] have been built there there's walls of
[43:53] the word that are there to protect you
[43:55] they're not there to bind you they're
[43:56] not there to keep you back but they're
[43:58] going to go to protect you from the
[44:00] things that would come in and destroy
[44:02] your life
[44:03] so you set up walls of the word all
[44:05] around you and but but these gates are
[44:07] still there and I've often thought you
[44:10] know if you've ever watched an old movie
[44:12] that uh
[44:13] they're picking a walled City I've
[44:15] always thought why don't they just do
[44:16] away with the gate
[44:21] well you're tired this afternoon
[44:24] you ever thought about that
[44:26] brother Ben you're stupid what no
[44:29] if you ever thought about that well
[44:30] there's a gate what's the gate for
[44:33] like hello they've got this wall and
[44:34] there's a weak spot and where does the
[44:36] Army the enemy Army always come against
[44:38] the gate
[44:41] why do they do that well the reason the
[44:43] Heather gate is because you need to let
[44:46] in some things
[44:49] right there's some things that have to
[44:50] be let in or the city will serve to
[44:53] death yeah
[44:54] so there has to be a gate and also to
[44:57] let things out
[44:58] right right so there's got to be a gate
[45:00] so when the gates these things are set
[45:03] up for our benefit not to hurt us to
[45:05] even the the senses of our body are not
[45:07] set up to hurt us but they're set up for
[45:09] our benefit but there's gate there
[45:11] there's a gate there yeah
[45:13] yeah and so you've got uh you've got
[45:15] control over it now think about it
[45:17] you've got control over the border of
[45:20] your mind
[45:21] are you with me now
[45:23] all right so now brother Brandon says if
[45:26] you've got your senses see taste feel
[45:28] smelling here they're all right but
[45:29] don't trust them unless they agree with
[45:31] the word all right all right
[45:33] amen they're all right but if they
[45:35] disagree with the word don't you listen
[45:36] to them
[45:38] he said now imaginations conscience
[45:40] memories reasons affections they're all
[45:43] right if they agree with the word but if
[45:45] your affection doesn't agree with the
[45:46] word get rid of it all right yeah
[45:48] you blow flu right quick
[45:51] if your reason disagrees with the word
[45:53] get away from it yeah that's right if
[45:55] your memory if your imagination if your
[45:57] conscience anything disagrees with that
[46:00] what's on the inside
[46:02] get rid of it
[46:04] now so Paul teaches us in second
[46:06] Corinthians 10 5 casting down
[46:08] imaginations
[46:10] and every High thing someone say every
[46:14] where every High thing that exalts
[46:16] itself against the knowledge of God and
[46:19] bringing into captivity
[46:22] every thought to The Obedience of Christ
[46:25] so in other words we're going to we're
[46:27] going to arrest our thoughts we're going
[46:29] to stop them at the border we're going
[46:32] to stop them at the gate
[46:35] right now whose job is it to stop it at
[46:38] the gate
[46:40] is it the pastor's job
[46:43] who's the border patrol agent
[46:48] come on now
[46:51] I am
[46:52] you are
[46:53] it's not your job to keep me happy right
[46:56] keep me in the in the life of us my job
[46:58] yeah
[46:59] yeah right are you with me they said
[47:01] well oh you can't do that for yourself
[47:02] no but I can't if the king is there yeah
[47:05] all right the king is there
[47:07] amen right so I'm born again yeah and
[47:10] the answer to all of her problems is not
[47:12] just to keep going back well I must not
[47:13] be born again I failed Build That Wall
[47:15] yeah yes stop them at the gate quit
[47:19] giving in there is Victory the devil's
[47:22] been lying to you the devil's killed you
[47:24] over and over again you can't have
[47:26] victory over that just like he tried to
[47:27] do to brother Branham my Mayo Clinic
[47:29] told him he said you'll never get
[47:30] victory over that we saw that this
[47:32] morning but but God showed him he would
[47:34] have the victory remember he said that
[47:36] squirrel was only six inches long yeah
[47:38] remember there is going to be Victory
[47:40] you can have Victory you can win the
[47:42] battle in the mind
[47:45] you can live with joy you can live with
[47:47] peace there is no reason for there to be
[47:49] church drama all the time there's no
[47:51] reason for the big trouble in your home
[47:53] constantly there's no reason for you to
[47:55] backslide over and over again there's no
[47:57] reason to be in and out and up and down
[47:59] he can have the victory you can stand
[48:02] for something you can be a nation that
[48:05] doesn't just let anything in come on
[48:11] now
[48:13] you got to cast these things down now
[48:15] remember we dropped the atomic bomb of
[48:18] faith
[48:20] you use the 22 rifle
[48:23] all right didn't sneak around with a pop
[48:25] a cap gun or a pellet gun but we dropped
[48:29] an atomic bomb yeah on on on the enemy
[48:33] yeah yeah and that was f-a-i-t-h brother
[48:36] Brandon said faith in the word of God
[48:37] yeah so that atomic bomb is dropped on
[48:40] the enemy
[48:41] and then when he's dropped on the enemy
[48:42] what happens well the enemy just blows
[48:45] all over the place you know
[48:47] well now you've got to keep him out
[48:50] because the truth is he's going to come
[48:52] back
[48:54] now so you've got Victory maybe maybe
[48:57] you
[48:58] you've been baptized you received the
[49:00] Baptist of the Holy Ghost you just stand
[49:02] there and all you're rejoicing you're so
[49:04] happy everything's going good you you
[49:06] just got like feels like you just got
[49:08] back from Camp you know everything's
[49:10] good and young people understand what
[49:12] I'm talking about some of you older
[49:14] people just like you had a good nap
[49:18] hahaha
[49:19] everything's going good everything's
[49:21] just just just fine and and and
[49:24] everything's everything's going well and
[49:26] then all of a sudden you get hit by an
[49:27] attack well I thought I had the victory
[49:30] you do have the victory faith is the
[49:33] picture you your nation is strong enough
[49:36] to overcome any attack that comes
[49:38] against it you have the word of God on
[49:40] your side you've got the presence of God
[49:42] with you he's come he's with you you
[49:45] have the message of the hour
[49:47] so he's come to protect you and to keep
[49:50] you but you've got to decide to stay in
[49:52] it
[49:56] so brother Brown says it it must be
[49:58] accepted in the mind
[49:59] and then it's believed with the heart
[50:02] then the word of God becomes a reality
[50:04] then every sense of soul and body is
[50:08] just scoured out with the Holy Spirit
[50:13] then your sense of God your conscience
[50:16] of God
[50:18] everything that's Godly
[50:21] flows through you
[50:22] there's not a doubt anywhere
[50:25] there's nothing can rise up nothing can
[50:28] come up in the memory and say well I
[50:30] remember Miss Jones tried to trust God
[50:32] Miss so and so miss doe tried to trust
[50:34] God for healing one time and she's fail
[50:36] but if that channel has been cleared out
[50:38] and been purged and been filled on the
[50:40] inside with the Holy Spirit that'll even
[50:42] come in memory no matter about Miss
[50:44] Jones and what she did it's you and God
[50:46] together nobody else but you two yeah
[50:49] there you are there's your battle now
[50:52] watch watch what he says he said kill
[50:54] him at the beginning yeah
[50:56] yeah stop him dead in his tracks
[50:59] it ain't how long you can make the war
[51:02] linger
[51:04] and stop it right now yeah
[51:06] you aren't more spiritual because you
[51:08] don't know if you're a savior you're not
[51:11] right that doesn't make you more
[51:12] spiritual you know you you got to stop
[51:14] him at some point at some point you need
[51:17] to you need to put the hammer down yeah
[51:19] yeah you need to you need to receive the
[51:22] blessing of God and believe God's word
[51:24] and move forward
[51:24] [Music]
[51:27] it's good that's good now
[51:30] he said if you're coming you'll keep
[51:31] them memories and conscious everything
[51:32] think about well I might fail it might
[51:34] not be right he said don't you do that
[51:36] at all
[51:37] you throw aside everything someone say
[51:38] everything everything audience
[51:41] participation night by the way
[51:43] everything amen and when you throw aside
[51:47] everything and open up the channel and
[51:49] say God your word is eternally true and
[51:52] it's for me if the whole church fails if
[51:55] the whole world fails yet I can't fail
[51:58] reality
[52:00] I can't fail because I'm taking your
[52:02] word
[52:03] so you are
[52:05] the border patrol agent now I need you
[52:08] to decide
[52:10] if you're gonna let that thought in
[52:13] or keep it out
[52:15] now the worst thing you can do is just
[52:17] sit there and take it
[52:20] right you you get you do have a decision
[52:25] right you you have a an authority it's
[52:28] given to you yeah
[52:30] that's right if they put somebody down
[52:31] at the border that was afraid to stop
[52:33] anybody
[52:34] he wouldn't do any good he'd lose his
[52:36] job
[52:37] right and so a man that's there he's got
[52:41] a badge he's got a gun he's at the
[52:42] border he's he's securing something he's
[52:45] he's watching over something yeah and
[52:48] what he's watching for is any traveler
[52:50] that would come by that would disrupt
[52:53] the program of the government that's
[52:56] currently in power
[52:58] right so the government that's in power
[53:00] is the government of the word yes the
[53:02] government of God where Christ has the
[53:04] preeminence the message of the hour
[53:05] that's where we live
[53:07] yeah right so so you as a border patrol
[53:10] agent you get to stand there and watch
[53:13] it at the borders of your mind and you
[53:15] get to stand there at those Gates and
[53:18] you and you get to watch and take every
[53:20] thought and and stop it for a moment
[53:23] right slow it down
[53:26] right don't just wave it through
[53:29] well
[53:30] my pastor said my church said no stop it
[53:36] you have a right to stop it
[53:38] right you don't have to put up with
[53:40] nonsense
[53:41] you don't have to put up with stuff to
[53:43] stop the word come on oh so and so said
[53:46] it it must be right you know we've done
[53:48] it this way for 50 years but what does
[53:50] the king say
[53:52] yeah what what kind of government do you
[53:54] have that your government is not a
[53:55] government of you and the pastor and the
[53:57] King this gets hard tonight but it's
[54:00] just the truth that's not the government
[54:01] the government is you and the key
[54:05] your pastor is there to preach the word
[54:07] but he's not there to keep out all the
[54:10] problems all right
[54:11] all the thoughts that come through
[54:13] that's our job
[54:15] all he can do is teach you to do that
[54:17] now you're the border patrol agent and
[54:19] so there's applicants coming by
[54:21] I told you it'd be different tonight
[54:25] people coming by for a Visa you know
[54:28] they come up here
[54:30] you know
[54:31] you know I'm on just a traveler just a
[54:34] tourist
[54:35] you remember when we went to Egypt
[54:37] what we did in Egypt you'll never forget
[54:39] that will you what we did in Egypt
[54:42] is would cross the border remember what
[54:45] they told us they said man it's gonna be
[54:46] so hard brother Wilson sent me videos
[54:48] from YouTube over and over again how
[54:50] hard it's going to be when we got to
[54:52] Egypt and I was scared to death to be
[54:54] honest with you we thought they were
[54:56] gonna we were carrying Contraband
[54:57] material message books
[55:00] I guess I guess it's safe to say it now
[55:04] we were we were sneaking stuff in that
[55:07] that shouldn't have you know shouldn't
[55:08] cross the border that's outlawed there
[55:10] and so we you know we were nervous so we
[55:13] had that one suitcase full of books and
[55:16] and so and we thought we'd seen these
[55:18] videos where if you come in if you're a
[55:19] photographer or something like that
[55:21] they'll take your cameras away I had my
[55:23] iPad with me I was scared to death I was
[55:25] going to lose my iPad I was going to
[55:26] lose all this equipment and things that
[55:28] we had I was gonna you know preacher
[55:30] can't preach anymore without an iPad so
[55:31] I was going to worry about that you know
[55:33] and and all the things that I hadn't and
[55:35] you know what when we got there but we
[55:37] didn't call ourselves preachers
[55:40] we didn't call her so we called
[55:41] ourselves tourists
[55:43] so we come in as tourists and when we
[55:45] come in as tourists say you know they
[55:46] waved Us in basically like it's one of
[55:48] the easiest security we've ever been
[55:50] through remember it was it was like it's
[55:52] nothing all this build up all this fear
[55:54] it's nothing they just let us in why
[55:56] because we come in as a tourist and come
[55:58] to find out they wanted our money
[56:03] yeah they want every American Tourist
[56:06] they can get
[56:07] and so it wasn't really that hard
[56:09] although we've been led to believe it
[56:11] was very difficult now the country
[56:12] itself was very difficult but the across
[56:14] the border was not really that hard at
[56:16] all and so we began to we begin to
[56:17] realize they wanted us
[56:20] we were wanted now there's other people
[56:22] they gave a hard time yeah yeah right
[56:24] those stories are real they gave them a
[56:26] hard time they didn't want them there
[56:28] yeah but they wanted us there well I
[56:30] hope you hear me now that's the way you
[56:31] have to be right you as a Sovereign
[56:34] Nation if I could put it that way uh you
[56:36] you go ahead and pay your taxes that's
[56:38] all right you you pay your taxes to the
[56:40] government all that I'm talking about
[56:41] spiritually
[56:43] you with you and God your government is
[56:45] you and God
[56:46] you go to church you listen to your
[56:48] pastor all those things but your
[56:49] government is you and God so you don't
[56:51] have to let just any thought yeah come
[56:53] on now right right
[56:55] come through your mind
[56:58] it's like this one looks pretty good
[57:00] I'll let him in but not this one but
[57:02] you've got to have some standard to
[57:04] judge that box
[57:07] so we begin to see people come now we're
[57:10] going to apply for a Visa and I put this
[57:12] on the slide so you just see what I'm
[57:14] looking at but now you just the way my
[57:16] mind works
[57:18] so up to the gate of imaginations come a
[57:20] sad little thought
[57:24] just come on
[57:27] Jason come here buddy
[57:30] I gave imagination man be sad
[57:35] just a sad little thought
[57:38] it come up for the border patrol agent
[57:40] oh
[57:42] oh nobody treats you right buddy you got
[57:45] some ID and he hands me his ID and it's
[57:47] nobody loves you
[57:49] first middle and last thing go sit down
[57:51] with Jason
[57:54] it's a sad little thought
[57:55] [Music]
[57:59] it comes they come I think there's more
[58:01] of those than any of them you know
[58:02] you know right oh I don't know if I'm
[58:05] gonna make it
[58:06] I just nobody loves me nobody cares
[58:10] about I'm not making fun of you tonight
[58:12] and how many times that sad little
[58:13] thought come in
[58:15] okay nobody noticed me today and I wore
[58:18] my best clothes I'll just come on
[58:20] Wednesday in my jeans so you would
[58:22] anyway so
[58:25] that's right nobody noticed me everybody
[58:27] kinda
[58:29] you know just kept their distance from
[58:31] me well why don't you just keep that
[58:33] thought out you have a lot less trouble
[58:36] see this little thought is going to come
[58:37] in and cause dissension in the
[58:39] government
[58:41] he's always going to be whispering he's
[58:43] going to be backbiting he's going to be
[58:44] spreading pamphlets all over the place
[58:46] and telling stories and and doing that
[58:48] and he don't belong there right
[58:51] right Hallelujah he don't belong in the
[58:53] government of God so what are you going
[58:55] to do you got to get you got to make a
[58:57] decision
[58:58] got to make a decision
[59:00] now he's got he's got a reason for
[59:01] traveling
[59:02] right yeah and his reason is well it
[59:05] didn't get invited to the party
[59:08] boy getting quiet
[59:12] well they thought of everybody else but
[59:14] me
[59:15] yeah well it looks like a good reason
[59:16] man I
[59:20] he's gonna be nothing but trouble
[59:24] what should we do
[59:25] now you get to make the decision what
[59:28] should we do
[59:29] should we approve the Visa
[59:32] got my stamp you know
[59:34] yes or no
[59:37] yes or no
[59:39] Visa denied
[59:41] why
[59:42] because we have a king
[59:45] and thus saith the king
[59:48] the king says a man that hath friends
[59:50] must show himself friendly
[59:52] and there's a friend that sticketh
[59:54] closer than a brother so if everybody
[59:56] else gives up on you God will never give
[59:58] up on you
[59:59] the king says greater love hath no man

[1:00:51] he's a self-righteous Pharisee he's
[1:00:54] going to come through and you aren't

[1:01:34] yeah save the king repent and be
[1:01:36] baptized every one of you in the name of
[1:01:38] Jesus Christ for the remission of sin
[1:01:40] and you shall receive the gift of the
[1:01:41] Holy Ghost and I followed that
[1:01:43] prescription I swallowed that pill yeah
[1:01:47] I followed him in baptism I received the
[1:01:49] baptism of the Holy Ghost he has no
[1:01:51] right to tell me that I can't make it
[1:01:53] through
[1:01:54] [Applause]
[1:01:56] are you with me so far yeah
[1:01:59] brother Brandon said listen brother
[1:02:00] you're never saved by any sign you're
[1:02:02] never saved by any sensation you're
[1:02:04] saved when you meet God's condition of
[1:02:06] his word and nothing else someone say
[1:02:09] nothing else
[1:02:10] nothing else so you say bye that's right
[1:02:12] God's word has made a way you're not
[1:02:15] safe because you feel like you're safe
[1:02:17] I'm not I'm not saved because I feel
[1:02:18] like I'm saved because a lot of times I
[1:02:20] don't feel that way but I'm saved
[1:02:23] because God gave the promise
[1:02:25] God's conditions and upon God's holy
[1:02:27] word I can defeat Satan seven days in a
[1:02:30] week and as many nights cause it's God's
[1:02:32] word
[1:02:33] I may believe that today
[1:02:36] either here is my word and believeth on
[1:02:38] him that sent me hands everlasting life
[1:02:39] and shall not come to judgment but it's
[1:02:42] passed from death into life that's what
[1:02:44] the King of Kings says
[1:02:45] [Music]
[1:02:48] thus saith the king
[1:02:50] kick him out
[1:02:53] but brother Ben I feel bad I made a
[1:02:55] mistake
[1:02:56] first John 2 on my little children these
[1:02:58] things write unto you that you sin not
[1:03:01] and if any man sin
[1:03:03] we have an advocate with the father
[1:03:05] Jesus Christ the righteous and he is the
[1:03:09] propitiation for our sins in other words
[1:03:11] he paid the price for us
[1:03:14] Hallelujah not for ours only but also
[1:03:16] for the sins of the whole world
[1:03:20] let's move on I'm not going to hold you
[1:03:21] long tonight there's this game of memory
[1:03:25] well it's a tough one keep them thoughts
[1:03:28] out
[1:03:28] of the Gate of memory
[1:03:31] because it comes along like a little old
[1:03:32] man or a little old woman
[1:03:34] just walking
[1:03:37] a little thought I remember
[1:03:40] when you were younger
[1:03:42] all the mistakes
[1:03:47] yeah
[1:03:48] his identity is sins of the past
[1:03:53] he's got a reason for traveling
[1:03:55] huh
[1:03:56] maybe you saw somebody used to party
[1:03:58] with
[1:04:00] everybody's got a past
[1:04:03] maybe somebody come around that made you
[1:04:05] uncomfortable yeah because you know what
[1:04:08] kind of person you were the last time
[1:04:10] you met that person yeah but you're not
[1:04:12] that person anymore
[1:04:16] but he comes through and begins to
[1:04:17] travel through oh I remember I remember
[1:04:21] I remember when you were a child and how
[1:04:23] bad you were in church
[1:04:25] huh I knew then that you would never be
[1:04:28] a proper child
[1:04:31] you would never those are probably the
[1:04:32] preachers today
[1:04:40] what are we gonna do about this thought
[1:04:44] think about it for a minute what are we
[1:04:46] gonna do about it he's gonna let it well
[1:04:47] you know I did it
[1:04:49] did you
[1:04:51] come on that's you saying it or the word
[1:04:53] saying
[1:04:57] I did it what does God have to say about
[1:04:59] it
[1:05:01] you say brother Ben this is what you did
[1:05:02] I say prove it yeah
[1:05:05] I got video evidence I got photography
[1:05:09] evidence you can't prove it by the word
[1:05:11] yeah by the word I've been released from
[1:05:13] that thing
[1:05:16] what are we gonna do we're gonna let him
[1:05:17] in
[1:05:18] yes or no
[1:05:22] you're getting good
[1:05:24] why thus said the king
[1:05:26] come now and let us reason together
[1:05:27] saith the Lord though your sins be a
[1:05:30] Scarlet they should be white as snow
[1:05:32] though they be red like Crimson they
[1:05:34] sure be as well he said as far as the
[1:05:36] East is from the West so far has he
[1:05:38] removed our transgressions from us
[1:05:41] Colossians today you are complete in him
[1:05:43] which is the head of all principality
[1:05:46] and Power in whom also you are
[1:05:48] circumcised with the circumcision made
[1:05:50] without hands and putting off the body
[1:05:52] of the sins of the flesh by the
[1:05:54] circumcision of Christ buried with him
[1:05:56] in baptism wherein also you are risen do
[1:05:58] you hear the king speaking tonight this
[1:06:01] is his word this is his manual this is
[1:06:03] why we're kicking that thought out
[1:06:06] who has raised him from the dead you
[1:06:07] being dead in your sins and the
[1:06:09] uncircumcision of your flesh have to be
[1:06:11] quickened together with him having
[1:06:13] forgiven you
[1:06:15] all
[1:06:17] trespassers
[1:06:18] I love this verse blotting out
[1:06:21] the handwriting
[1:06:23] of ordinances that was against us
[1:06:26] which was contrary to us
[1:06:29] and took it out of the way
[1:06:32] nailing it to his cross
[1:06:36] he just blotted it out
[1:06:41] Hallelujah you could not read the
[1:06:45] accusation
[1:06:47] once it had been blotted out
[1:06:50] who am I
[1:06:52] and having spoiled principalities in
[1:06:54] Paris who made a show of them openly
[1:06:55] triumphing over them in it but the
[1:06:58] Branham says you're standing I know
[1:06:59] you've heard it before but think about
[1:07:00] it now you know you know this why let
[1:07:03] that thought in yeah
[1:07:05] right why is he not getting stopped at
[1:07:07] the border
[1:07:11] he said God you never sent it the first
[1:07:13] place God don't even know nothing it's
[1:07:15] in the sea of forgetfulness you never
[1:07:17] did it you were accused of it by the
[1:07:19] accuser but really from the beginning
[1:07:21] you were predestinated to be a son and
[1:07:23] daughter of God you're standing there
[1:07:25] was your old book of divorcement is put
[1:07:27] away it's dead absolutely out of
[1:07:29] existence even in the mind of God
[1:07:33] sin has been placed in the bleach of the
[1:07:34] blood of God that he said on Calvary is
[1:07:36] that what we believe
[1:07:37] you stand on the sea of glass clear as
[1:07:40] Crystal brother said it wasn't the sea
[1:07:42] that was mingled with fire because you'd
[1:07:44] already been judged and found clean
[1:07:50] no judgment in it at all
[1:07:52] the saith the king
[1:07:55] Hallelujah
[1:07:57] there's another gate a gate of reason
[1:08:00] negative reason
[1:08:02] you know the thing is you you got to be
[1:08:04] careful because there's certain of these
[1:08:06] Gates you probably have no problem with
[1:08:08] but other ones that you do
[1:08:11] so you got to deal with the ones you
[1:08:13] have a problem with you need to really
[1:08:14] watch that one yeah
[1:08:16] yeah some of you some people believe
[1:08:17] anything a preacher tells them
[1:08:20] and the appearance of this thought
[1:08:23] many times it's like a preacher
[1:08:27] an angel of Light
[1:08:29] with reason yeah
[1:08:31] yeah and his identity is that he offers
[1:08:34] you surely you won't die
[1:08:37] it's reason for traveling is a paycheck
[1:08:43] boy he'll let you know
[1:08:46] why would you go to a message Church why
[1:08:48] why bother
[1:08:50] to do that
[1:08:52] why why live that way you don't have to
[1:08:54] live that way and he takes the Bible and
[1:08:57] he takes history and he takes all these
[1:08:59] things and he tries to weave it together
[1:09:01] surely
[1:09:03] you won't die
[1:09:05] tell you what that's the fastest one you
[1:09:07] ought to get out your stamp
[1:09:11] the Visa denied
[1:09:12] are you gonna let him in
[1:09:15] no no why why should you not let him in
[1:09:17] thus saith the king
[1:09:19] though we or an angel from heaven come
[1:09:22] on preach any other gospel unto you than
[1:09:25] that which we have preached unto you let
[1:09:26] him be a curse
[1:09:29] Satan and Eden when he first come to
[1:09:30] those these attacks to attack a person
[1:09:32] but the brother said he knew the
[1:09:33] children of God was fortified with the
[1:09:35] word
[1:09:36] he said Satan attacked the word
[1:09:39] this is important he never attacked a
[1:09:41] being you'd say well Satan's attacking
[1:09:43] me no he attacks the word first he could
[1:09:46] never get to you if it wasn't for the
[1:09:48] word getting the word out of the way
[1:09:50] first so before Satan attacks you
[1:09:53] physically mentally all those ways he
[1:09:55] attacks the word in your mind
[1:09:57] he attacks the word he tries to make you
[1:09:59] think less of it he tries to make it
[1:10:01] less special to you he tries to tell you
[1:10:03] that it don't really matter yeah right
[1:10:06] that's his job but we have a job kick
[1:10:09] that sucker out of here
[1:10:11] I get him out he don't belong in the
[1:10:13] kingdom of God
[1:10:15] get rid of it
[1:10:17] now watch brothers look at that sneaker
[1:10:19] lizard what he does today
[1:10:21] first thing he can't lay it on and he
[1:10:23] said you can't lay it on him well that's
[1:10:24] not a good person and that's a good
[1:10:26] person
[1:10:27] but the only thing he tries to do no
[1:10:28] matter how good the person is is to get
[1:10:30] them to deny that word yeah
[1:10:32] that's just one thing he wants you to do
[1:10:34] get you to deny that word
[1:10:35] and the word is what it is church
[1:10:38] it's not it's not as interpreted by
[1:10:43] the word is what it is God interprets
[1:10:45] his own word by bringing it to pass yeah
[1:10:48] so Satan tried to attack the word of the
[1:10:49] Garden of Eden so he had to have
[1:10:51] something now that he could use so the
[1:10:52] human being would look better than the
[1:10:53] word he had to have something that would
[1:10:55] look better to the human being than a
[1:10:56] word and you know what he used reasoning
[1:10:59] just what we'd say now listen common
[1:11:02] sense
[1:11:05] yeah right I'm gonna get really down
[1:11:08] where we live for a minute
[1:11:10] I heard a preacher say well you just
[1:11:12] have common sense you wouldn't need much
[1:11:13] of the message
[1:11:18] that's not what a prophet said
[1:11:20] common sense
[1:11:22] what's common sense
[1:11:24] common sense is like well it makes sense
[1:11:26] just to do it a certain way just just
[1:11:28] the way it is it don't make sense to sit
[1:11:29] in church all day
[1:11:34] preaching doesn't make sense
[1:11:37] I know you got to have common sense in
[1:11:39] your everyday life but don't apply that
[1:11:41] to the word
[1:11:44] you can't take your common sense because
[1:11:47] Common Sense isn't so common anymore
[1:11:49] you might not have quite as much common
[1:11:51] sense as you thought you did you're much
[1:11:53] better off those with common sense
[1:11:55] looked at Abraham and said there's no
[1:11:57] way you can ever have a baby but Abraham
[1:11:59] had more than Common Sense Abraham had a
[1:12:02] sixth sense
[1:12:03] [Music]
[1:12:04] right right Common Sense is a good thing
[1:12:08] until it goes against the word that's
[1:12:10] right
[1:12:11] so brother random said reasoning just
[1:12:13] what we'd say common sense so that's
[1:12:15] what he used and he succeeded so that's
[1:12:17] what he used all along Common Sense yeah
[1:12:21] yeah reasoning
[1:12:23] well it don't it's just not reasonable
[1:12:26] now watch
[1:12:27] let's let every man's word be alive but
[1:12:29] God's be true
[1:12:31] how about that what are we gonna do with
[1:12:33] him
[1:12:34] don't let him in
[1:12:36] see if you don't let him in he can't
[1:12:38] come in and start doing damage
[1:12:42] now if I didn't want brother Joel to be
[1:12:43] in my house I invite brother Joel to my
[1:12:45] house
[1:12:46] but he'd eat a lot less if he wasn't in
[1:12:48] there
[1:12:51] I know he can take this while I pick on
[1:12:53] Joe that's the only reason
[1:12:56] but members all together all the time
[1:12:58] but see if I never invited him in he
[1:13:01] couldn't lay back in my chair
[1:13:04] I couldn't kick his shoes off house
[1:13:06] would smell better
[1:13:10] all right
[1:13:12] all right so so if I never let him in
[1:13:15] you know if he just but once he's in he
[1:13:17] can do what he wants
[1:13:18] but the brander says he'll wreak havoc
[1:13:20] if he gets in
[1:13:21] don't let him in it's not how long you
[1:13:24] fight the battle let's get it over with
[1:13:26] yeah drop the atomic bomb of faith on it
[1:13:30] good stop it at the beginning quit
[1:13:32] entertaining it yeah the problem is you
[1:13:35] got some of these Travelers coming by
[1:13:36] your way and you're entertaining them
[1:13:38] kill the fatted calf for that sad little
[1:13:41] thought
[1:13:43] yeah
[1:13:46] let's have us a pity party me and you
[1:13:49] tell me more
[1:13:55] God help me tonight
[1:13:59] there's a gate of affection this is the
[1:14:00] last one
[1:14:03] affection
[1:14:04] it's appearance pretty you're handsome
[1:14:08] huh
[1:14:09] oh it looks good
[1:14:12] it's identities you deserve this
[1:14:17] you deserve this
[1:14:19] it has a reason for traveling boredom
[1:14:22] frustration
[1:14:24] well my wife you know she
[1:14:26] my husband
[1:14:27] you don't treat me like he should you
[1:14:29] know
[1:14:30] well that's an issue but you need to
[1:14:32] talk to your husband
[1:14:35] are you with me now yeah
[1:14:37] because if you're not careful
[1:14:39] somebody some slick girl come in and
[1:14:40] talk to you
[1:14:42] now think spiritually as well but but in
[1:14:45] a natural sense how many times does that
[1:14:47] happen you you go out with somebody you
[1:14:49] want to be around somebody because they
[1:14:50] smell good
[1:14:51] I don't know why teenagers would ever
[1:14:53] like each other then if that was the
[1:14:55] case
[1:15:00] well I like the car he drives well
[1:15:02] that's the way this Slicker comes it's
[1:15:04] pretty or handsome
[1:15:07] and for for men today we fight a battle
[1:15:10] how to battle with our eyes
[1:15:13] in our mind but you know if you would if
[1:15:15] you if you'd make a covenant with your
[1:15:17] eyes
[1:15:18] you'd have a whole lot better thought
[1:15:19] life
[1:15:21] yeah and that's what job said when they
[1:15:23] accused him of some kind of sin he said
[1:15:25] I didn't let it in
[1:15:27] I never committed adultery because I
[1:15:30] never thought about it and I never
[1:15:32] thought about it because I made a
[1:15:34] covenant with my eyes Job 31 1. I made a
[1:15:36] covenant with my eyes
[1:15:38] why then should I think upon a mate
[1:15:41] notice how it goes I made a covenant
[1:15:43] with my eyeballs
[1:15:46] I turned my head
[1:15:48] why then should I think
[1:15:51] upon a maid
[1:15:53] Matthew 5 28 Jesus said whosoever
[1:15:55] looking on a woman to lust After Earth
[1:15:56] have committed adultery with her already
[1:15:58] in his heart I don't want some
[1:16:00] adulterous spirit in my life how am I
[1:16:02] going to keep it out stop it at the door
[1:16:09] now he said brother Ben

[1:16:14] saying no to people
[1:16:17] getting tired of stamping that passport
[1:16:19] rejected rejected well there are some

[1:17:21] little bit more of that I'm gonna let
[1:17:22] that in and sometimes it comes through
[1:17:25] those same Gates yeah
[1:17:27] I we remember what God did for us and it
[1:17:30] blesses us oh can you remember what he
[1:17:33] did for you one day how he saved you how
[1:17:35] he brought you out can you remember that
[1:17:37] God is a good god and he's the same
[1:17:39] yesterday today in favor can you
[1:17:41] remember
[1:17:42] same gate but he comes in that gate of
[1:17:45] memory and you just wave him on why
[1:17:46] because that's one of the things that's
[1:17:48] on the list
[1:17:50] men
[1:17:51] some praise I'm not gonna stop that
[1:17:54] why are so many Customs officials in

[1:18:05] well I'm gonna stop you you might do
[1:18:07] some damage how
[1:18:10] people if you if you want to accuse me
[1:18:12] of loving God too much that's all right
[1:18:13] yeah
[1:18:16] because the Bible says that there be any
[1:18:18] praise
[1:18:19] the Bible says let everything that hath
[1:18:21] prayer breath praise the Lord that
[1:18:23] includes me so let me let that in yeah

[1:18:51] in the bid out in the world if I could
[1:18:53] only be known you got Victory now
[1:18:54] because you're living behind the wall
[1:18:56] the wall is not your parents the wall is
[1:18:59] not the church the wall is the word
[1:19:02] Hallelujah everything's in order like
[1:19:05] God's Army in the heavens but the
[1:19:06] parents said what you caught then you
[1:19:07] got a solar system hallelujah it's God
[1:19:10] set the stars in order and said hang
[1:19:12] there till I call you and they stay
[1:19:14] there nothing's going to move them when
[1:19:16] God can get a man in his hands till he
[1:19:18] can get senses conscience everything
[1:19:19] cleaned out get rid of all them
[1:19:21] Travelers till it stands with God behind
[1:19:24] it in the spirit there's not a devil in
[1:19:26] the world can poke it down in there
[1:19:28] he'd come around and say you don't feel
[1:19:30] better your conscience has even gone to
[1:19:32] that the flu is so clear it shouts
[1:19:34] Hallelujah
[1:19:36] the outlet blows a whistle glory to God
[1:19:39] it shines out certainly just as clean
[1:19:41] and clear for the word of God to work
[1:19:43] through the power of God
[1:19:46] who do you love him tonight
[1:20:05] I know it's hard sometimes you
[1:20:08] feels pretty good
[1:20:10] what that
[1:20:12] thought in if you let him in he's going
[1:20:13] to wreck your house
[1:20:19] I can't tell you the damage that's been
[1:20:21] done by the wrong thoughts
[1:20:25] I also could never describe the
[1:20:27] victories that have been won
[1:20:30] by people letting in the right thoughts
[1:20:33] it's that simple
[1:20:35] just letting in the right thoughts
[1:20:38] I'll get Melancholy and said
[1:20:40] but brother Ben I lost a loved one I had
[1:20:42] trouble but look where they are
[1:20:47] the same faith for them that you have
[1:20:49] for yourself
[1:20:52] look look where they are
[1:20:57] I mean you don't understand that that
[1:20:58] sad little thought comes around and it's
[1:21:00] just
[1:21:02] it's just so easy to let in because
[1:21:03] [Music]
[1:21:05] it's me
[1:21:07] just the way I am
[1:21:09] just just I just can't get over it
[1:21:14] if you can start today
[1:21:17] enforcing your border your life will
[1:21:20] change
[1:21:21] [Music]
[1:21:26] the thing is
[1:21:27] some of the propaganda that these
[1:21:29] Travelers spread you know it isn't true
[1:21:32] [Music]
[1:21:35] do you listen to it because it's just
[1:21:37] easier to let them in
[1:21:40] just easier to Let It Go
[1:21:43] I pray that we'd learn to stop it
[1:21:44] tonight why don't you do that just in
[1:21:46] your own way in your heart
[1:21:48] Lord if I've allowed anything in any
[1:21:50] thought
[1:21:51] anything floating around in the kingdom
[1:21:53] of God
[1:21:54] say well I gotta let him in the battle's
[1:21:56] in the mind no you have victory in the
[1:21:58] mind
