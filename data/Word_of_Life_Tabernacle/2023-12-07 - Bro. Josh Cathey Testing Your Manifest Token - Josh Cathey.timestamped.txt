[49:10] sake but uh but anyway brother Josh is a
[49:13] a dedicated young man to the Lord and
[49:16] and you know it's always been my
[49:17] privilege to help young men and I'm a
[49:20] young man but I I realized I had a
[49:23] moment of recognition the other day that
[49:24] now I'm offering bring advice to Young
[49:26] preachers and that that's a little bit
[49:28] odd for me but I always wanted to help
[49:31] young men get started in the ministry
[49:33] because I stood on the shoulders of
[49:34] giants and I was uh helped by many uh
[49:38] Godly pastors and men and so I want to
[49:41] do everything I can to help young men
[49:43] starting out and to win a soul for the
[49:45] kingdom of God here's what brother
[49:46] brandham said about it he said young
[49:48] preacher get into the field stay into
[49:51] the harness said all you young preachers
[49:54] and things don't you say around don't
[49:56] you just sit and do nothing get out
[49:58] yonder and win a soul do something get
[50:02] on get moving he said don't stop young
[50:03] preacher over there God bless your heart
[50:05] when he said that he said that to me
[50:07] said that to brother Josh all the other

[50:28] in your life God's able to speak to that
[50:30] need do you believe that and all
[50:33] Ministry is getting yourself out of the
[50:34] way and I believe I've heard such
[50:36] wonderful things about brother Josh's
[50:38] Ministry I believe that he'll just be
[50:39] able to get himself out of the way
[50:41] tonight and we'll just pull on the word
[50:43] so so hard that we'll just get
[50:45] everything that we came for tonight you

[52:23] amen God bless you tonight it's good to
[52:26] be here with you thank you brother Ben
[52:28] for opening your pull pit to me um I was
[52:31] going to introduce myself but I feel
[52:33] like I'm related to about half the
[52:34] people in here so I didn't know if I
[52:36] need to do that but once again I'm
[52:38] brother Joshua Kathy from Shalom
[52:40] Tabernacle and tcon Arizona my pastor is
[52:42] brother Israel Po and he sends his
[52:45] greetings to you
[52:46] all and um I told the church I I
[52:49] preached this last Sunday in Tennessee
[52:51] and told the church how I'm missing home
[52:54] I have a beautiful wife at home two
[52:55] little chunky babies running around but
[52:58] I also told them that every time you
[52:59] come into the house of the Lord it feels
[53:02] a little bit like home don't it it feels
[53:04] like you're just right at
[53:05] place if we could turn in the scriptures
[53:08] thank you musicians if we could turn in
[53:10] the scriptures to Isaiah 648
[53:15] first and then 2 Thessalonians chapter 1
[53:19] verses 1- five
[53:24] second
[53:31] Isaiah 648 says but now oh Lord Thou Art
[53:36] Our Father we are the clay and thou our
[53:39] Potter and we all are the work of thy
[53:43] hand in the second scripture 2
[53:47] Thessalonians 1 veres
[53:54] 1-5
[53:58] it reads Paul and
[54:00] sylvanus and timotheus unto the Church
[54:03] of the Thessalonians and God our Father
[54:05] and the Lord Jesus Christ Grace unto you
[54:08] and peace from God our Father and the
[54:10] Lord Jesus Christ we are bound to thank
[54:13] God always for you Brethren as it is
[54:15] meat because that your faith groweth
[54:17] exceedingly and the charity of every one
[54:20] of you all towards each other aboundeth
[54:22] so that we ourselves Glory in you in the
[54:25] Churches of God listen to this right
[54:27] here for your patience and faith and all
[54:29] your persecutions and tribulations that
[54:32] you endure and he says which is a
[54:35] manifest token of the righteous Judgment
[54:39] of God that ye may be counted worthy of
[54:42] the kingdom of God for which ye also
[54:45] suffer amen let's bow our heads Heavenly
[54:48] Father Lord Jesus we just thank you for
[54:50] this opportunity to come into the house
[54:53] of the Lord Lord we know that your
[54:54] prophets said that anytime we have this
[54:57] opportunity it is a Christian's
[54:58] privilege and honor to enter into here
[55:02] father we ask that you would bless this
[55:03] service and that you would watch over me
[55:05] watch over the congregation and just be
[55:07] with us both father in Jesus Christ's
[55:09] name amen you may be
[55:12] seated so uh when I saw this scripture
[55:15] what caught my eye was what it was
[55:18] saying what these persecutions and
[55:20] tribulations that we endure are it says
[55:23] they are a manifest token and then
[55:26] another translation of manifest token
[55:29] stood for evidence it said that their
[55:31] persecutions and tribulations that they
[55:33] were enduring was evidence of the
[55:36] righteous Judgment of God and then as I
[55:38] read Isaiah 648 I wondered out of
[55:41] everything that the Lord could have used
[55:42] in the scripture as an example why would
[55:45] he choose a Potter and Clay as an
[55:47] example two such simple things but I
[55:50] started looking closer and it's more
[55:52] about the process of the Potter and the
[55:55] the
[55:56] clay and I seen an interesting quote it
[55:58] wasn't brother Brandon but it struck me
[56:00] and it said most people don't want to be
[56:02] part of the process they just want to be
[56:05] part of the outcome it said but the
[56:08] process is where you figure out who's
[56:10] worth being part of the outcome yes sir
[56:13] amen and it was so I realized it was
[56:15] more about the process going from a
[56:16] useless piece of clay to a beautiful
[56:19] bowl or a cup something with purpose in
[56:21] the Lord yeah and so the Potter he can
[56:24] he can form his clay in many different
[56:26] ways you know the pieces that he forms
[56:28] they're all different they have
[56:30] different purposes they have different
[56:31] reasons for being formed they're not all
[56:34] the same and he can use his hand he can
[56:36] use a a potter's wheel if he needs one
[56:39] and he always has a Master model to go
[56:42] off of just as we do we have Jesus
[56:44] Christ we have a Master model ourselves
[56:47] that the scripture gives us to build off
[56:49] of Amen so the very there steps in
[56:53] making these clay pieces a very first
[56:55] step is you want to Center that clay if
[56:58] you're using a potter's wheel you have
[57:00] to have that clay centered on that
[57:02] potter's wheel if it's not centered it's
[57:04] not going to turn out right it's going
[57:06] to fall one way it's going to fall the
[57:08] other way or possibly fall off the wheel
[57:10] itself and us as Christians we have to
[57:12] be centered on the word of God just the
[57:14] same manner the same application to it
[57:19] so when centering the clay the Potter he
[57:20] can push and he can pull on the clay and
[57:23] he's not doing these things he can get
[57:25] rough with it sometimes but he's not
[57:26] doing it to harm the clay in any way
[57:29] he's only doing it to help the clay
[57:31] become what it needs to be that's his
[57:34] only purpose in doing it the next step
[57:37] is a dry out so after they Center the
[57:40] Clay and they're shaping it what it
[57:42] needs to be the Potter then must let the
[57:44] clay dry out or you could call it the
[57:45] die out phase yeah which is simply
[57:48] letting it sit and letting all the
[57:50] unneeded moisture get out of that clay
[57:53] before you put it in an oven because
[57:55] that moisture in the clay if if it stays
[57:57] in there if these things that aren't
[57:59] needed in the clay if they stay in the
[58:01] clay too long and you put it in the oven
[58:04] that water it'll turn to vapor and it'll
[58:06] explode there'll be a reaction to it
[58:09] there's a reaction that each of these
[58:11] things that this clay must go through if
[58:13] they try and put it in the fire a little
[58:16] too earli or with something unneeded in
[58:18] it it could be bad it could turn out
[58:20] worse than it was before that's right
[58:22] that's good brother brandham said in
[58:24] letting off the pressure he was talking
[58:26] about that weatherbe Magnum that was
[58:28] board
[58:29] wrong and we all know it blew up in his
[58:32] face cuz it was bored incorrectly and he
[58:35] said and so will every man find the same
[58:37] thing that profess to be a Christian
[58:40] that doesn't get the right start from
[58:42] the New Birth he'll blow up somewhere
[58:45] right it says there's too much pressure
[58:47] on
[58:48] it if you're not ready for it if you're
[58:50] not there there's too much pressure for
[58:52] it cuz the the attacks that come with
[58:54] being a Christian those are different
[58:55] attacks all right on those are deep
[58:58] spiritual cutting attacks that come with
[59:00] being a Christian yeah that's right and
[59:02] he said if you if you don't got the
[59:04] right start at that new birth it can be
[59:07] dangerous he said there's too much
[59:09] pressure on it it won't stand it he'll
[59:11] find himself blowed up somewhere yeah
[59:14] that's right so according to experts
[59:15] they say it's best to just let this clay
[59:17] dry out naturally not to manufacture
[59:20] anything not to try and rush it along to
[59:22] let it dry out how it's supposed to dry
[59:25] out let it get these things out like us
[59:28] let let them come out how the Lord
[59:30] intended them to come out these things
[59:32] through tests and trials that's how it's
[59:34] going to happen just like this clay this
[59:36] Clay is going through a test every stage
[59:39] is a different test for a different
[59:41] purpose in that Clay's existence right
[59:44] so let's say for a second this clay
[59:46] let's say it's got a mind of its own
[59:48] it's partially dried out but it's still
[59:50] holding on to a few little things that
[59:52] it doesn't need to be holding on to I
[59:54] saw saw a story that fit with this
[59:56] perfectly it was about a it was a method
[59:58] these African Hunters would use to hunt
[1:00:00] monkeys in the jungle and what they
[1:00:03] would do is they would uh they would
[1:00:05] have a big gourd type of fruit and it
[1:00:08] would be hollowed out and they would
[1:00:09] bore a hole in it just big enough for
[1:00:11] the monkey's hand to go into that hole
[1:00:15] and so they would put it up in a tree
[1:00:16] and then they would put peanuts in it so
[1:00:18] then the monkey he'd be swinging along
[1:00:20] and he'd smell the peanuts and he would
[1:00:22] go for it and when he went for it he
[1:00:24] could just get his hand in there but by
[1:00:25] the time that he grabbed the peanuts he
[1:00:27] couldn't get his hand out anymore so he
[1:00:30] was stuck there and so the hunters would
[1:00:33] come and they said that these monkeys
[1:00:35] were so bound and determined to get
[1:00:37] those peanuts out that they would not
[1:00:39] let go of the thing that was holding
[1:00:41] them captive oh my they they wouldn't
[1:00:43] let go that they could be free at any
[1:00:46] point that they wanted to be free but
[1:00:48] they would not let go of what was
[1:00:50] holding them captive amen do we see that
[1:00:54] sometimes yeah I know that's been me
[1:00:55] before there's been things that I've had
[1:00:57] trouble letting go of that were holding
[1:00:59] me captive keeping me under bondage I
[1:01:02] was in prison because of these things
[1:01:04] come on but all you have to do is let it
[1:01:06] go and the monkey it says if he would
[1:01:08] only release his prize yeah when it was
[1:01:12] talk when the when the man was talking
[1:01:13] he said if that monkey would only
[1:01:15] release his prize then he could slip his
[1:01:17] hand back out and he could be free
[1:01:20] that's all he had to do and what the
[1:01:22] monkey thought to be his prize was
[1:01:24] actually his demise you know those
[1:01:26] peanuts they look good they smelled good
[1:01:28] they tasted good but that doesn't mean
[1:01:30] it was good for the
[1:01:31] monkey that doesn't mean he actually
[1:01:33] needed them come on so the next step in
[1:01:37] the clay is firing the clay it's the
[1:01:38] oven time so this is this is what
[1:01:41] happens after the drying out process and
[1:01:43] then this is what really molds the clay
[1:01:45] together this is what really fuses all
[1:01:47] the clay together and that's the part
[1:01:49] I'd really like to focus on because as
[1:01:52] our Journeys as Christians we're going
[1:01:53] to be in the fire quite a bit we're
[1:01:56] going to spend a whole lot of time in
[1:01:57] the fire in the oven that's going to be
[1:02:00] where most of our time is
[1:02:02] spent so once in the fire all these
[1:02:05] different chemical compounds and
[1:02:06] minerals they're burned out of the clay
[1:02:09] and the clay has become something new
[1:02:10] altogether it's ceramic at this point
[1:02:12] right it's become its own creation it's
[1:02:15] become what its creator meant for it to
[1:02:18] become now at that point it can be
[1:02:21] cracked and it can be broken again but
[1:02:24] it can never go back to being that
[1:02:26] useless lump of clay that it was before
[1:02:29] it can never go back to that it has been
[1:02:31] changed from that point on it is
[1:02:34] something new but it doesn't in there
[1:02:36] there's still more tests to come at that
[1:02:38] point one of the first tests that they
[1:02:40] use on new ceramic is called a stain
[1:02:42] test all right so what they do is they
[1:02:44] take a stain and they put it on the
[1:02:47] outside of the
[1:02:48] ceramic and when they put that stain on
[1:02:50] the outside of the ceramic they let it
[1:02:51] sit for a while and then they'll come
[1:02:53] back and look at it and they'll observe
[1:02:55] the outside of it and then they'll look
[1:02:56] on the inside of it because if there was
[1:02:59] a crack that they didn't know about on
[1:03:00] the outside that stuff that they stained
[1:03:03] it with on the outside seeped into the
[1:03:06] inside of that ceramic pot if there are
[1:03:09] cracks that they didn't know about if
[1:03:10] there's these little weaknesses that it
[1:03:12] can find an inlet into that interior of
[1:03:15] that pot that's what they're looking for
[1:03:17] stuff that they didn't know was
[1:03:19] there any little
[1:03:21] weakness but thankfully there's
[1:03:23] something called the wax resist and they
[1:03:26] just heat up the wax that's all it is
[1:03:27] it's a special type of wax and what it
[1:03:30] does is it protects whatever portion of
[1:03:34] that ceramic you put it over you can
[1:03:35] wrap the whole thing in it or you can
[1:03:37] put it over the cracks of that ceramic
[1:03:39] and it's applied it it's got different
[1:03:42] colors about it and what what its main
[1:03:44] job is is to preserve the purity of the
[1:03:47] area that it is applied to and it acts
[1:03:50] as a shield all right so it can have a
[1:03:53] crack come on now but there's a wax
[1:03:55] resist but the most important thing
[1:03:57] about the wax resist when I was studying
[1:03:59] it the most important thing I noticed is
[1:04:02] it must be applied now you could take
[1:04:04] that that wax resist the tub of the wax
[1:04:07] and you could sit it here and you could
[1:04:08] put the pot here they could be in close
[1:04:10] proximity you could put it on top of it
[1:04:12] you could put it around it but just just
[1:04:15] putting it in close proximity or in its
[1:04:17] presence wasn't enough it had to be
[1:04:19] applied to it there had to be the
[1:04:22] application at some point
[1:04:25] reminded me of what would have happened
[1:04:27] if if Rahab wouldn't have hung that
[1:04:29] Scarlet thread out that window come on
[1:04:32] what would have
[1:04:33] happened she'd have died with the rest
[1:04:35] of them but she had to put it out there
[1:04:37] there had to be an application and she
[1:04:40] followed it to the tea and it it reminds
[1:04:42] me of Peter Peter Peter was so close to
[1:04:45] Jesus and he had he had walked with
[1:04:47] Jesus for such a long time he had cast
[1:04:49] out Devils he he was his friend sure you
[1:04:53] know they probably had slept close to
[1:04:55] one another they were very close but
[1:04:58] Peter had only been in the presence he
[1:05:01] had only been around Jesus but on the
[1:05:04] day of Pentecost when Peter really
[1:05:06] changed that presence went in Peter sir
[1:05:09] he was no longer just just around the
[1:05:12] presence that presence lived inside of
[1:05:14] him and there was a change that happened
[1:05:16] that day amen and talking about that wax
[1:05:21] resist you know we we have a baling
[1:05:24] Gilead that we can
[1:05:26] apply we have an application as a
[1:05:28] Christian brother brandham said in
[1:05:30] Balman Gilead he said I spoke to a woman
[1:05:32] some time ago and she was looking so
[1:05:35] frail she noticed sometime in her
[1:05:36] younger days of this advertisement on
[1:05:39] the televisions and the signboards of
[1:05:41] beautiful women smoking cigarettes and
[1:05:43] the company says that it will make you
[1:05:45] thin that's when they sold their product
[1:05:48] to the public if it makes you thin is
[1:05:50] because you're dying it's TB and cancer
[1:05:53] that's making you thin she said I just
[1:05:55] have to smoke oh my she said I'm a slave
[1:05:59] to it well you don't have to be a slave
[1:06:02] to it there is a bomb in Gilead there is
[1:06:06] a bomb in Christ he said there's a cure
[1:06:09] for it sir you don't have to do it he
[1:06:12] said you don't have to drink you don't
[1:06:14] have to smoke you don't have to gamble
[1:06:16] the reason you do it is because you
[1:06:18] refus the remedy yeah come on the Lord
[1:06:22] Jesus has made remedy he made a remedy
[1:06:25] on that cross right there amen he said
[1:06:28] you'll die on the church steps until you
[1:06:31] take the remedy that cures that's what
[1:06:34] satisfies that's what takes sin away
[1:06:36] they say I just can't help it you can
[1:06:38] help it you can help it it said what if
[1:06:41] the man laying on the doctor's step said
[1:06:44] oh I know he's got the medicine in there
[1:06:45] to cure this disease but I just can't go
[1:06:48] in and brother Bram says why can't you
[1:06:50] go in it's because sometimes we start
[1:06:54] buying into these little Whispers of
[1:06:55] lies in our ears we start taking them as
[1:06:58] truth we we take Satan's Bluff as a
[1:07:00] truth instead of God's promise
[1:07:04] sometimes I do as well many times there
[1:07:07] may be something you're struggling with
[1:07:09] and it's so easy to buy into a lie of
[1:07:11] the devil he makes it so
[1:07:13] believable that there can be there can
[1:07:15] be a whole lot of Truth in that lie
[1:07:17] right all right but that little bit just
[1:07:19] like he did with Eve that little bit
[1:07:20] that's off determines all of it yeah so
[1:07:25] if the wax is never applied to the pot
[1:07:27] then what good was all that testing for
[1:07:30] so say say you've been through a long
[1:07:31] Battle of sickness a doctor he can sit
[1:07:34] you an appointment he can give you his
[1:07:38] diagnosis he can prescribe medicine to
[1:07:41] you but it has to be your will to take
[1:07:45] that
[1:07:45] medicine the doctor is not going to show
[1:07:48] up and just put it in your mouth for you
[1:07:50] now he's been there he's told you what's
[1:07:52] going on you both know what's going on
[1:07:54] but it has to be your will to take that
[1:07:57] medicine we have to apply that blood in
[1:08:01] our lives oh come on if there's a
[1:08:03] situation if there's a trial if there's
[1:08:06] a test apply that blood oh yes and then
[1:08:10] believe we have to apply that
[1:08:13] blood the balm is in Christ the prophet
[1:08:15] said Christ is the medicine he's the
[1:08:18] Cure is that right has he been the Cure
[1:08:21] in your life before well he can be the
[1:08:23] Cure again
[1:08:24] he can do it over and over Hebrews 138
[1:08:27] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:08:29] forever if he if if a miracle happened
[1:08:32] in your life at 10 years old it can
[1:08:33] happen at 40 years old 50 years old it
[1:08:36] can happen at any point it doesn't
[1:08:38] matter what time he's the same God all
[1:08:41] the time every day Monday through Friday
[1:08:45] even on the weekends he's the same God
[1:08:49] so we can see this testing it's not to
[1:08:50] hurt the product or to make the product
[1:08:53] look bad in any way yeah it's to prove
[1:08:55] the work of the Potter is what it's to
[1:08:58] do that's right but who we proven it to
[1:09:02] critics the devil's the biggest
[1:09:04] critic isn't he he's always pointing you
[1:09:07] out tell telling you what's wrong right
[1:09:09] here and you know there's art critics so
[1:09:10] say this ceramic pot you put it in an
[1:09:12] art show and there's going to be a
[1:09:14] Critic come around and he's say well
[1:09:16] that's not quite right and he's going to
[1:09:17] measure it and do different things to it
[1:09:19] and he's going to think these different
[1:09:21] cracks that we talked about earlier are
[1:09:23] just they're mistakes but they're not
[1:09:25] mistakes cuz once that wax resist is
[1:09:28] applied to it that crack only becomes
[1:09:31] part of that pot's character oh yeah
[1:09:33] right these these marks that we have
[1:09:35] these scars that we have from the devil
[1:09:37] they they come a part of your character
[1:09:39] they make you who you are is that right
[1:09:42] and he can't touch you unless God says
[1:09:44] he can touch you first he's got to go
[1:09:47] get permission he's got to he's got to
[1:09:49] walk up there slowly with his headbound
[1:09:51] say well can I do this he's got to get
[1:09:53] some permission first for he lays a
[1:09:55] finger on one of
[1:09:57] us thank you Lord Brother brandham said
[1:09:59] in we have seen a star and have come to
[1:10:01] worship him he said and sometimes we
[1:10:03] think that our burdens I might inject
[1:10:05] this right here that we think our
[1:10:07] burdens are so heavy sometimes that
[1:10:09] there's nothing like it in the world he
[1:10:13] said now think about this he said do you
[1:10:15] know all those things are good for you
[1:10:18] oh yeah he said they are all to mold you
[1:10:20] and make
[1:10:22] you now think about that think about a
[1:10:24] trial think about a trouble in your life
[1:10:26] you've been through and that was good
[1:10:27] for you now it didn't it didn't seem
[1:10:30] like it at the time you didn't think it
[1:10:32] was good for you but God had a plan for
[1:10:34] you and God had a purpose for you he had
[1:10:37] a purpose in doing exactly what he did
[1:10:39] in your life and we may not understand
[1:10:41] it's when you're in it it's hard to
[1:10:43] understand it's like imagine you on a
[1:10:46] train and you going into a tunnel that
[1:10:48] was maybe had a turn in it and now
[1:10:51] you're going along and you can't see the
[1:10:53] light at at the end of that tunnel until
[1:10:55] you break around that corner and but you
[1:10:57] didn't understand why you couldn't see
[1:10:59] the light the first bit of that tunnel
[1:11:01] just is sometimes we don't understand
[1:11:03] why things happen but they happen for a
[1:11:05] purpose right Romans 8:28 tells us that
[1:11:08] is that right he said he said prophets
[1:11:12] and sages was molded on the backside of
[1:11:14] the desert in the hot blazing sun
[1:11:17] through tribulations and trials and
[1:11:20] persecutions and these and listen to
[1:11:22] this right here he said and these things
[1:11:24] that we have today there's nothing
[1:11:26] happened to us that hasn't happened to
[1:11:29] other Christians before you say well but
[1:11:31] today we have cell phones we have the
[1:11:33] internet we have these other we have
[1:11:35] these issues that these these Believers
[1:11:37] of the past they didn't have to deal
[1:11:39] with this but Satan you got to watch him
[1:11:42] he's got a new device but the Same
[1:11:44] Spirit working in that device that's
[1:11:45] right the same filthy Spirit working in
[1:11:47] it you know
[1:11:50] maybe he just got he's so subtle over
[1:11:53] time time he just has a new device every
[1:11:56] day whatever's going to catch the
[1:11:57] people's attention he's going to have a
[1:12:00] hold of Hollywood he's going to have a
[1:12:02] hold of it and then he's going to seep
[1:12:04] that spirit in there and then he he's
[1:12:06] trying to slowly give you that Spirit as
[1:12:08] well amen but just as we have our
[1:12:10] products and we want to try them and
[1:12:12] make sure they're tested the Lord wants
[1:12:14] to do the exact same thing with us oh
[1:12:16] yeah we are his products we're his hands
[1:12:18] and his feet here we are the ones that
[1:12:20] do his working
[1:12:22] here am man just as if you if you bought
[1:12:25] a if you bought a a Chevy or a Ford
[1:12:28] truck you would hope that they had
[1:12:29] tested it at 70 or 80 miles an hour so
[1:12:32] when you was on the highway the tires
[1:12:34] didn't fall off you would hope that they
[1:12:36] had done some testing or or maybe you
[1:12:38] pull a trailer with it maybe that's your
[1:12:40] purpose for that truck maybe you pull a
[1:12:42] trailer maybe you have Livestock in it
[1:12:44] or
[1:12:45] something but it needs to be proved for
[1:12:47] a purpose and that's what the Lord does
[1:12:50] he proves his people for a purpose he
[1:12:53] proves them then puts them in their
[1:12:55] place their exact place of where they
[1:12:58] need to be lady member a preacher
[1:13:00] teacher evangelists whatever they may be
[1:13:02] whoever you are each one has a purpose
[1:13:05] in the Lord than Amen brother brandham
[1:13:09] said and how can I overcome he said now
[1:13:10] we're expected to be tested that's a
[1:13:13] good lesson for my brother back there
[1:13:15] also he that cometh to God must first be
[1:13:18] tested tested what with the word that's
[1:13:21] God's test do you believe it he that
[1:13:24] cometh to God must be tested that only
[1:13:26] shows a true child then see be tested
[1:13:30] and when the test comes all he says
[1:13:32] right here you can't overcome L there's
[1:13:35] a test give to you come on and when test
[1:13:38] is given it's to see whether you can
[1:13:40] overcome or not oh yes he said and Jesus
[1:13:43] said to him that overcometh the test
[1:13:46] right brother Brandon went on to say the
[1:13:48] test is the greatest thing that ever
[1:13:50] happened to you he said the test is the
[1:13:53] greatest thing that ever happened to you
[1:13:56] now it don't always feel like it's the
[1:13:58] greatest thing but we're not basing all
[1:14:00] this off feelings either oh come on he
[1:14:03] he didn't brother Bram said in one place
[1:14:05] he said he didn't say did you feel it he
[1:14:07] said did you believe it amen so the and
[1:14:11] feeling is what has got so many the you
[1:14:14] can have a feeling but that feeling's
[1:14:15] got to line up right here it's got to
[1:14:18] line up right in this Bible it's got to
[1:14:19] line up with those tapes it's got to
[1:14:21] line up with the word of God if you have
[1:14:23] a feeling and that's how you got to test
[1:14:24] it that's what he's saying here that is
[1:14:26] God's test come on
[1:14:29] Amen and brother brandom say it's a good
[1:14:32] evidence that God is with us now I I
[1:14:35] could see how that if that pot could
[1:14:38] think the ceramic pot might question why
[1:14:41] it's getting put through these different
[1:14:42] strength tests or a stain test or these
[1:14:46] things that could possibly harm it it
[1:14:48] would be questioned why is this
[1:14:49] happening to me why is this happening in
[1:14:51] my life but in the end it's only to make
[1:14:53] it stronger going forward and to see
[1:14:56] where that it may be lacking see where
[1:14:58] the weaknesses might be so they can get
[1:15:01] past you know I've heard before people
[1:15:03] say that you know if somebody doesn't
[1:15:06] realize there is a problem that's what
[1:15:07] they say about addiction they have to
[1:15:09] realize there is a problem first before
[1:15:11] they can move past that problem it has
[1:15:13] to be it has to be apparent to them hey
[1:15:16] this is an issue right here before
[1:15:17] they're going to put any time of their
[1:15:19] life getting past that issue amen
[1:15:23] and it's not it's not cuz the Potter's
[1:15:25] mad at what he created he just wants
[1:15:28] what best for it is that right the Lord
[1:15:31] just wants what's best for us sir and he
[1:15:33] knows what's best for us he said in the
[1:15:36] in the message I know we ask for comfort
[1:15:38] and peace God gives us the best he could
[1:15:41] give us trials and
[1:15:43] tribulations yeah he said that's better
[1:15:46] than comfort and peace that's right our
[1:15:48] Comforts is just beyond the river amen
[1:15:51] it was until the Hebrew children was
[1:15:53] forced into the fiery furnace on one of
[1:15:56] their most outstanding trials that they
[1:15:59] seen one like the Son of God standing
[1:16:01] among them said their troubles produced
[1:16:04] the son of God standing among them their
[1:16:07] troubles produced the son of God
[1:16:09] standing among them in the breezes to
[1:16:12] wave away the heat wave it said but not
[1:16:14] until they went into the fire did the
[1:16:17] comforter appear not until they went
[1:16:20] into the fire did their comforter appear
[1:16:24] did he come to help amen he said their
[1:16:26] troubles produced the son of God
[1:16:29] standing among them you know those
[1:16:30] troubles squeezed them squeezed them
[1:16:32] tight you know back in that they didn't
[1:16:33] have nobody on their side they didn't
[1:16:35] have a church full of people saying We
[1:16:37] believe that too it was them they
[1:16:39] believed it come on but it squeezed them
[1:16:42] and what came out of that squeeze was
[1:16:44] Faith yes sir all that it lifted was
[1:16:47] their faith they can see this pers
[1:16:49] persecution is coming because of what I
[1:16:52] believe amen now Thea walked into that
[1:16:54] furnace and been saying oh it's over now
[1:16:58] God's forsaken us he's not with us
[1:17:00] things might have turned out different
[1:17:03] they might have went a different
[1:17:04] direction but that was not their
[1:17:05] attitude they said God is able to
[1:17:08] deliver us amen they say God is able to
[1:17:12] deliver us and that Faith produced the
[1:17:14] son of
[1:17:15] God oh thank you Lord and how do you
[1:17:17] know that they didn't even have a
[1:17:19] promise like ours they didn't have the
[1:17:21] promise to put their faith in and and
[1:17:23] they didn't have anybody backing them up
[1:17:25] the prophet said he did the same thing
[1:17:27] he was going to glorify himself in the
[1:17:29] Hebrew children he made a preparation
[1:17:32] when did he make it the Hebrew children
[1:17:34] didn't have any promise they couldn't
[1:17:36] get back here and read in the Bible and
[1:17:38] say Lord you promised in your word that
[1:17:41] any of your children ever went into a
[1:17:42] fiery furnace you would deliver them
[1:17:44] they didn't have no perfect written out
[1:17:47] nice word of God like we have but they
[1:17:49] believed that their God was able yeah oh
[1:17:52] yes is that right they believed that
[1:17:55] their God was able said you would
[1:17:57] deliver them all right Lord we're coming
[1:18:00] right there upon that and then brother
[1:18:02] Brandon right here he he stops quoting
[1:18:04] the scripture he says well that wouldn't
[1:18:05] have been so hard to do just their faith
[1:18:07] because God has already promised that's
[1:18:09] he's talking to us that's us right there
[1:18:11] he said that wouldn't be so hard to do
[1:18:13] come on just by their faith he we have
[1:18:15] God's promise why wouldn't we believe it
[1:18:17] why wouldn't we believe that God can
[1:18:20] Deliver Us from things that trials and
[1:18:22] tribul in our life that he can heal our
[1:18:24] bodies that he can heal our
[1:18:26] minds that he can come down and touch us
[1:18:29] why wouldn't we believe that cuz it's
[1:18:31] right here in his
[1:18:34] word said but here's the words they had
[1:18:37] God was so real to them they said our
[1:18:39] God is able how about that the fellow
[1:18:42] that don't believe in Divine Healing God
[1:18:44] is able to deliver us come these fiery
[1:18:46] furnace but will not bow down to your
[1:18:49] images and when they walked into the
[1:18:51] fiery furnace upon bare sheer faith that
[1:18:55] God was able not promised but he was
[1:18:57] able God sent Christ in the fiery
[1:19:00] furnace and fann the fire away from them
[1:19:03] and protected them and brought them out
[1:19:05] sure but I'm saying God is able and he
[1:19:07] says right here now you don't come
[1:19:09] saying God is able he said you don't
[1:19:11] have to come that you can say God you
[1:19:13] promised oh yeah God you promised amen
[1:19:16] he said you prepared it at Calvary and
[1:19:19] I've come to receive it he said it's
[1:19:21] your preparation you provided it and you
[1:19:24] promised it and I see others receiving
[1:19:26] it so I come too Lord to get my part of
[1:19:29] it I want my portion I want my part of
[1:19:32] that
[1:19:33] healing when you took that cross up on
[1:19:35] Calvary I want my part of that cuz I was
[1:19:37] in your mind I've been in your mind
[1:19:40] before the foundation of the world and I
[1:19:42] want my part Lord that's right he said
[1:19:45] you'll go away a different person you'll
[1:19:47] go away with such an anchor inside your
[1:19:49] soul that nothing can upset you he said
[1:19:52] you know that that you're healed you
[1:19:53] know that God has taking care of this
[1:19:55] matter for you because he promised he
[1:19:57] says he gives testings and trials with
[1:20:00] these promises he gives testings and
[1:20:02] trials with these promises amen how much
[1:20:06] more faith should we have with all
[1:20:08] that's been given to us with all that's
[1:20:10] been promised wonderful our Fai should
[1:20:12] be through the roof my face should be
[1:20:14] through the roof but these tests and
[1:20:16] these trials they make it
[1:20:18] hard sometimes we doubt sometimes a
[1:20:20] little he starts Whispering again yeah
[1:20:23] they make them
[1:20:24] tough thinking on a manifest token as in
[1:20:27] the scripture who's heard who knows what
[1:20:29] a touchstone is brother brand I think
[1:20:31] he's mentioned it twice in the taste but
[1:20:33] a touchstone it's a it's a stone they
[1:20:36] use to test whether gold is really gold
[1:20:38] or not yeah that's right and it's a
[1:20:40] little black stone you have and and
[1:20:42] you'll have a mark of real gold on there
[1:20:44] then what they do is they take sorry
[1:20:47] they take the they take another gold
[1:20:49] piece and they scratch it in there
[1:20:51] underneath that and they see if the two
[1:20:53] match up yeah now brother Brenham said
[1:20:56] that the man that's got good gold
[1:20:57] doesn't mind going to the Touchstone he
[1:21:00] don't mind it and you know what causes
[1:21:02] it I I was thinking about it what
[1:21:04] causes really in the end what
[1:21:07] determines whether that is real gold or
[1:21:09] not is how it reacts to the friction
[1:21:12] that's applied so if you have that gold
[1:21:15] ring and you start rubbing it on there
[1:21:17] and that friction if it doesn't if it
[1:21:19] don't handle that friction well it's not
[1:21:21] going to show up as real gold but it's
[1:21:23] how it handles the friction when it's
[1:21:25] put against that Touchstone that shows
[1:21:28] whether it is real gold or not that's
[1:21:32] good and he said the man that man with
[1:21:35] the good gold he's not scared of that
[1:21:37] test he's not scared for he he welcomes
[1:21:39] him he says come what may yeah I can't
[1:21:43] control it anyway so come what may and I
[1:21:45] will face this test and another way that
[1:21:48] they used to to do for gold it said in
[1:21:51] the old days brother Brenham said
[1:21:52] conferences the old days the only way
[1:21:54] they had to separate it was a beater he
[1:21:57] said beat the gold with a hammer like
[1:21:59] the Indians beat it and the only way
[1:22:01] that the beater knew that he had the
[1:22:03] gold ready was as when he beat all the
[1:22:06] drw out of it and he would beat it and
[1:22:08] turn it over and beat it and beat it
[1:22:10] until all the dross went out when he
[1:22:12] seen his own self reflect back into the
[1:22:15] gold he knew then that all the dirt and
[1:22:17] the iron and the foreign matters was out
[1:22:19] of the gold when he seen himself reflect
[1:22:22] when Christ sees his reflect in us we
[1:22:25] need to be reflectors of Christ in this
[1:22:28] day amen no matter what the test no
[1:22:31] matter what the trial the heartache the
[1:22:34] hard time we need to reflect Christ in
[1:22:36] this day amen show others what Christ
[1:22:39] looks like we're the only Bible some
[1:22:41] people may see we're the only Christ
[1:22:44] some people may see amen they may see no
[1:22:47] other good in a day but you you may be
[1:22:50] the only bit of good that they get to
[1:22:51] see in a day
[1:22:53] good sir oh my very true it said and
[1:22:57] that's the way God is trying to do his
[1:22:59] church is to beat it till all the Creeds
[1:23:02] and the nonsense and all the world is
[1:23:04] beat out of it till it reflects back the
[1:23:07] life of Jesus Christ amen and if you
[1:23:10] notice that's one of the enemy one of
[1:23:12] his favorite things to do is tell a
[1:23:15] Christian that you aren't actually what
[1:23:17] you believe you are all right in the
[1:23:19] middle of a test he's going to try and
[1:23:21] convince you that you're not what you
[1:23:23] believe you are or what the scripture
[1:23:25] claims that you are amen amen he wants
[1:23:27] you to start doubting your position as a
[1:23:30] believer in these tests and I there was
[1:23:34] a I was studying the other day and there
[1:23:36] was a A syndrome that popped up it's
[1:23:38] called impostor syndrome and it's a it's
[1:23:41] a behavioral health thing going around
[1:23:44] right now I guess and they say it only
[1:23:47] occurs it's a lot of
[1:23:49] self-doubt and you start thinking no
[1:23:52] matter what you are what you've done it
[1:23:53] makes you just think that you're nothing
[1:23:56] it makes you think you're low that
[1:23:57] you're low down that you're nothing that
[1:23:59] you've never achieved anything and it
[1:24:01] said that it mostly occurs in high
[1:24:04] achieving individuals and I thought well
[1:24:07] what's a higher achieving individual
[1:24:08] than a a born again believer today how
[1:24:11] much higher do you get you know there's
[1:24:13] people that make a lot of money there's
[1:24:15] people that do this in the world do that
[1:24:17] in the world they're really smart and
[1:24:19] all that but a born again believer is
[1:24:22] the highest achieving individual there
[1:24:24] is in the land today
[1:24:27] amen and these individuals it said they
[1:24:30] can't internalize who they are they
[1:24:32] can't believe within themsel who they
[1:24:35] are amen and it says that they're that
[1:24:38] it said that's the biggest reason from
[1:24:42] somebody achieving their full potential
[1:24:45] is not realizing who they are and that's
[1:24:47] what the enemy wants he wants you to
[1:24:49] believe that you are a fraud he wants
[1:24:51] you to believe that you're an imposter
[1:24:53] he wants you to believe because of
[1:24:54] things you've done because of how you've
[1:24:57] reacted to certain situations cuz you
[1:25:00] can say if somebody say somebody's
[1:25:02] testing your patients out there maybe
[1:25:03] you're driving and somebody cuts in
[1:25:05] front of you and you know you say
[1:25:08] something you shouldn't say or something
[1:25:11] happens like that immediately after that
[1:25:14] happens the enemy is going to start
[1:25:16] telling you oh see a Christian wouldn't
[1:25:17] have done that a real believer you're an
[1:25:20] impostor you're a fraud you're not who
[1:25:22] the scripture says you
[1:25:24] are and that's what he wants that's the
[1:25:27] same way he's always done it and I I
[1:25:29] read a story it's about it was about a
[1:25:32] tiger that these people had trapped and
[1:25:35] they had trapped at Young and they had
[1:25:37] they had beat on this tiger and they had
[1:25:39] abused it and they had heard it from a
[1:25:42] young age they had started
[1:25:44] Young And as it came up because of all
[1:25:47] that beaten they they had beaten it into
[1:25:50] submission and this tiger
[1:25:53] it believed that it was like a house cat
[1:25:56] it didn't know it was a tiger it didn't
[1:25:57] know it was a a big creature meant to be
[1:25:59] free in Rome and they had they showed a
[1:26:02] picture of people walking it on a a
[1:26:04] leash you'd put a Chihuahua
[1:26:07] on and that tiger they had beaten it in
[1:26:10] submission so much that tiger didn't
[1:26:13] realize that it was a tiger anymore now
[1:26:15] at any moment it could have broke off
[1:26:17] that leash and it could have mauled
[1:26:19] whoever that man was that beat it but it
[1:26:22] did didn't know that it was a tiger it
[1:26:24] had been tricked in the thinking that it
[1:26:26] was nothing that it was weak that it was
[1:26:30] helpless and that's what he does to us
[1:26:32] he wants to tell you you're weak you're
[1:26:34] helpless you have nothing you can't do
[1:26:37] anything he'll put you on a real short
[1:26:39] leash and they'll try and lead you
[1:26:41] around
[1:26:42] sometimes but we need to break off those
[1:26:44] leashes we don't belong on a leash we're
[1:26:47] free we are eagles we fly high we're
[1:26:51] God's people
[1:26:53] amen and there was I read another story
[1:26:55] about a circus elephant and they did the
[1:26:56] same thing they had since it was a baby
[1:26:59] and they had gotten it they tied it up
[1:27:00] with a you know like a almost like a
[1:27:02] bungee cord a tiny little rope oh my but
[1:27:05] they had done it since it was a tiny you
[1:27:08] know a baby elephant and they it grew up
[1:27:10] and they never used a differ Siz rope
[1:27:13] they used the same size rope that
[1:27:15] elephant the only reason that it was
[1:27:17] still bound is because it thought it was
[1:27:19] still bound it thought that that rope
[1:27:21] could still hold in mind it didn't know
[1:27:25] that it was a big strong elephant
[1:27:26] capable of Breaking Free at any point
[1:27:29] and going free amen but you know every
[1:27:32] little lie that he tells you about
[1:27:34] yourself is actually a truth about him
[1:27:37] yeah come on come on think about that
[1:27:40] everything that he points at you and
[1:27:41] says you're this he actually is
[1:27:44] that John 844 says when he speaketh a
[1:27:48] lie he speaketh of his own yeah oh yeah
[1:27:51] all right is that right and that's
[1:27:52] usually a pretty good indicator of
[1:27:54] jealousy he wants to be you he wishes he
[1:27:57] could be you but he can't sir he can
[1:28:00] anymore he's jealous right he just want
[1:28:02] he wants to be a believer so bad and he
[1:28:05] he he would I bet he'd give anything to
[1:28:08] be able to enjoy that Kingdom at the end
[1:28:10] but he's not going to he's going to be
[1:28:12] cast out is that right you ever heard
[1:28:14] one of the sports critics that they you
[1:28:17] know they probably never an analyst that
[1:28:19] never played a day in their life never
[1:28:21] played the sport
[1:28:22] and like a let's say a college football
[1:28:24] or NFL guy and he's the quarterback
[1:28:28] might miss a receiver over the middle
[1:28:29] it's a 30 yard pass and he overthrows
[1:28:31] him or something and that guy's saying
[1:28:33] wow how could he not hit him and this
[1:28:35] guy the guy talking can't even throw it
[1:28:37] 10 yards but he's saying how could he
[1:28:39] not hit that
[1:28:40] guy that's jealousy he wishes he was
[1:28:43] that quarterback out there playing he
[1:28:45] wishes he could actually hit that guy
[1:28:47] and that's just how Satan is he wants to
[1:28:48] stand on the outside and he wants to
[1:28:51] criticize and tell you what you are and
[1:28:53] what you aren't but let's look at a few
[1:28:55] of things let's look at hit the ones
[1:28:57] that he usually tells you you aren't
[1:28:59] he'll say you can't be healed he'll say
[1:29:02] this sickness in your body it's over
[1:29:05] you're just going to you're going to
[1:29:06] hold on to it you're never going to get
[1:29:09] past it but Jesus's Stripes say
[1:29:12] different the scripture says different
[1:29:15] now he says this but the scripture says
[1:29:17] different he says you've gone too far
[1:29:20] you've sended away your day of Grace
[1:29:23] there's no more Mercy left for
[1:29:25] you to too far but then the grace of God
[1:29:28] says different yeah is that right yeah
[1:29:31] is that what the scripture tells us he
[1:29:33] says you're weak-minded he says this
[1:29:35] problem with anxiety this problem with
[1:29:37] depression you'll never get past it Oh
[1:29:40] my he says you can't do it yeah says
[1:29:44] that that your God can't do it you can't
[1:29:45] do it but the mind of Christ says
[1:29:49] different oh yeah there's a he tries to
[1:29:51] pervert these things he tries to tell
[1:29:54] you you can't but we can through Christ
[1:29:58] amen but all these lies he's telling you
[1:30:00] they are truths about himself he has
[1:30:03] send away his day of Grace yeah he can't
[1:30:05] be healed oh come on he is just jealous
[1:30:08] that he cannot have what you have amen
[1:30:12] so the next time he's Whispering those
[1:30:14] things just think this these are the
[1:30:16] cries of a a jealous
[1:30:19] insecure yeah nobody right what he says
[1:30:23] he holds no what he says holds no power
[1:30:24] over you oh my not a bit of it it
[1:30:28] doesn't nothing right but that's the way
[1:30:31] anything worth anything has ever been
[1:30:33] made through test and pressure oh yeah
[1:30:36] says you don't you don't get a diamond
[1:30:37] without some intense heat and
[1:30:40] pressure there was a man in the early
[1:30:42] 1900s his name was Peter Marshall he was
[1:30:44] a I think he was a presbyterian Minister
[1:30:47] he said may we think of Freedom not as
[1:30:49] the right to do as we please but as has
[1:30:52] the opportunity to do what is right he
[1:30:54] said when we long for life without
[1:30:56] difficulties remember us that the Oaks
[1:31:00] grow strong in contrary winds and
[1:31:02] diamonds are made Under
[1:31:05] Pressure those Oaks they strive they
[1:31:09] thrive in rough winds you know that's
[1:31:11] when they're at their strong you want to
[1:31:13] make an oak you know what makes an oak
[1:31:16] so tough their Roots their root system
[1:31:18] people would say that's a big strong
[1:31:20] tree they would think it was bark or
[1:31:22] maybe the density of the wood but it is
[1:31:24] the root system of the oak that makes it
[1:31:27] so tough and on the outside it may be
[1:31:29] beaten up and battered but it's
[1:31:31] something from underneath the surface
[1:31:33] that makes it so tough oh yeah just with
[1:31:36] us it's something from deep down it's
[1:31:38] the spirit of God in us it's the
[1:31:41] presence in us that makes us tough we're
[1:31:45] weak in the flesh but God's spirit is
[1:31:49] tough than God's spirit runs deep within
[1:31:52] each and every one of us for our healing
[1:31:55] for our trials for our
[1:31:57] tribulations amen also Lord and Oak's
[1:32:00] root
[1:32:02] system when planted around each other in
[1:32:04] Oak it will reach out and search for
[1:32:06] other Oaks oh my so Oaks are strongest
[1:32:11] when they're planted amongst each other
[1:32:13] because they will reach out and bind
[1:32:15] their root systems together oh yeah amen
[1:32:18] and that's just how we are in the house
[1:32:20] of God we come here we gather together
[1:32:23] not just to hear a sermon not just to
[1:32:25] hear whatever anybody's got to sing but
[1:32:28] it's to bind ourselves together in faith
[1:32:32] through Christ thank you Lord and be
[1:32:35] strong together that that is exactly why
[1:32:38] Fellowship matters you have to have
[1:32:41] Fellowship each one of we're all
[1:32:43] different people yeah you know this
[1:32:45] brother may he may know how to handle
[1:32:47] this brother or sister this sister may
[1:32:48] know how to handle this brother maybe
[1:32:51] nobody else could could do it but you
[1:32:52] that is why Fellowship matters right it
[1:32:55] matters to come into the house of God
[1:32:57] Amen and an oak it's strongest when it's
[1:32:59] planted amongst other Oaks and that is
[1:33:02] the exact same for us going to church
[1:33:05] just as Fellowship matters I'll say
[1:33:07] going to church
[1:33:09] matters that seems to be a Mark
[1:33:11] today people not want to go to church
[1:33:14] but going to church matters to get
[1:33:16] around other believers people of like
[1:33:19] Precious Faith amen amen thank you Lord
[1:33:23] you know without some of the Oaks that
[1:33:25] were in my life I wouldn't be here today
[1:33:29] I can say that 100% truly I know without
[1:33:33] some of the oak trees that I leaned on
[1:33:35] that I bound my roots to I wouldn't be
[1:33:38] standing here today and now I may I may
[1:33:41] still be a small
[1:33:43] Oak but I still look up to them big Oaks
[1:33:46] and I'm still bound to those big Oaks
[1:33:48] and that is why the fellowship is so
[1:33:51] important
[1:33:52] important in closing I'd like to mention
[1:33:54] maybe one more example of testing so
[1:33:57] what about
[1:33:58] steel you think about steel now the the
[1:34:01] first stages of making steel it's not
[1:34:04] ready to support the building that it's
[1:34:05] going to go to yeah that's right it's
[1:34:08] not ready in the early stages you have
[1:34:09] to go through metal casting you know
[1:34:11] that's where molten metal it's poured
[1:34:12] into a mold and it solidifies it and it
[1:34:15] makes it into whatever piece that it
[1:34:17] needs to be to go into a building so
[1:34:19] that building can serve its purpose
[1:34:22] amen now it takes some it also and still
[1:34:25] it takes some tough tests to
[1:34:28] qualify excuse me take some tough tests
[1:34:31] to qualify to be in the structure of a
[1:34:33] building if we could turn real quick to
[1:34:36] Hebrews 12 verses 5-
[1:34:50] 11
[1:34:55] Hebrews 12: 5-11 says and ye have
[1:34:58] forgotten the exhortation which speaketh
[1:35:00] unto you as unto children my son despise
[1:35:04] not thou the chastening of the Lord nor
[1:35:07] faint when thou art rebuked of him for
[1:35:09] whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth and
[1:35:12] scourgeth every son whom he receiveth if
[1:35:15] ye endure chastening God deal with you
[1:35:17] as his sons for what son is he whom the
[1:35:20] father chasteneth not he says but if ye
[1:35:23] be without chastisement whereof all are
[1:35:26] partakers then are ye bastards and not
[1:35:29] Sons it says furthermore we have had
[1:35:33] fathers of our flesh which corrected us
[1:35:35] and we gave them reverence shall we not
[1:35:38] much rather be in subjection unto the
[1:35:40] father of spirits and live oh yes said
[1:35:43] for they verily for a few days chastened
[1:35:45] us after their own pleasure but he for
[1:35:48] our profit that we might be partakers of
[1:35:51] of his
[1:35:52] Holiness verse 11 right here now no
[1:35:55] chasing for the present seeth to be
[1:35:59] joyous but Grievious nevertheless
[1:36:02] afterward it yieldeth the Peaceable
[1:36:05] fruit of righteousness unto them which
[1:36:07] are exercised thereby that's saying for
[1:36:11] the for the moment it's not joyous to be
[1:36:13] tried to be chasen to be corrected to be
[1:36:16] rebuked when you're in the wrong but
[1:36:19] afterward what it yields
[1:36:21] is worth so much more and brother Bram
[1:36:23] in the leian church age he read that
[1:36:26] exact scripture and right
[1:36:29] after he quoted this he said herein Is
[1:36:32] Now set forth the love of God he said
[1:36:35] herein yeah herein our chastening here
[1:36:38] in our test here in our
[1:36:40] trials is now set forth the love of God
[1:36:44] yeah he desired in love a family of his
[1:36:46] own a family of Sons Sons like himself
[1:36:50] there before him lies all mankind as one
[1:36:54] lump of clay out of the same lump he
[1:36:57] will now make vessels unto honor and
[1:36:59] unto dishonor yes he said the choosing
[1:37:02] will be his own choosing then those
[1:37:04] chosen ones born of his spirit will be
[1:37:07] trained yeah to conform to His Image in
[1:37:10] their walk and that's I guess that's
[1:37:12] what I would like to start calling
[1:37:13] instead of calling something in my life
[1:37:15] a trial or a tribulation or a hard time
[1:37:18] I'll just call it training that's all it
[1:37:20] is
[1:37:21] it's all just a lot of training to get
[1:37:24] ready he says he repes with all
[1:37:27] longsuffering and gentleness and mercy
[1:37:30] he chastens with nail scarred hands says
[1:37:34] sometimes this Potter must take the
[1:37:36] vessel he is working on and thoroughly
[1:37:39] break it down in order that he may
[1:37:41] rebuild it exactly as he desires it said
[1:37:45] and right here this is the key right
[1:37:47] here I love this said but it is love
[1:37:49] that is his love another way of his love
[1:37:52] there is not there cannot be another way
[1:37:56] of his love and I thought about that his
[1:37:58] love and the chastening and the training
[1:38:00] you know if I my two babies if they were
[1:38:03] here with me and one ran out in the road
[1:38:06] right and one got in the road now I know
[1:38:08] if they get hit by a car out there it
[1:38:10] will kill them it'll lead to death
[1:38:13] that's right and you better believe once
[1:38:15] I got to them and if they were safe
[1:38:19] there would be some chastisement that
[1:38:20] went on yeah something would happen
[1:38:23] there there would be some rebuking some
[1:38:25] chastisement there would be some
[1:38:26] training there would be a whole lot of
[1:38:28] stuff that went on once I got them back
[1:38:32] but that's important and I wouldn't be
[1:38:34] doing it because I didn't like them
[1:38:36] right I wouldn't be doing it because I
[1:38:38] didn't have any care for them I would be
[1:38:40] doing it because I love them I would
[1:38:43] correct them because I love them because
[1:38:45] I know that could kill
[1:38:48] them oh my so very similar to to The
[1:38:51] Clay Pot steel goes through a process to
[1:38:53] burn out all impurities that are present
[1:38:56] in the steel and then this is this is
[1:38:58] probably one of my favorite steps that
[1:39:00] happen with the steel it says for
[1:39:02] Reliable longevity and a bare extreme
[1:39:04] weight structural steel must be of the
[1:39:06] right
[1:39:07] composition it says iron and carbon are
[1:39:10] two of the most vital components used by
[1:39:12] steel mills when making structural steel
[1:39:15] so you have iron and you have carbon it
[1:39:17] says the carbon lends strength to the
[1:39:19] iron ore it says which is a source for
[1:39:22] the iron and the steel and it's quite
[1:39:24] soft on its own said that the iron
[1:39:26] that's in steel on its own is quite
[1:39:29] soft but when you fuse it when you put
[1:39:31] carbon into that iron it makes
[1:39:34] steel amen when you put God's spirit in
[1:39:39] man it makes steel it makes Believers
[1:39:43] that can withstand it makes Believers
[1:39:45] that have purpose it makes Believers
[1:39:48] that can continue on Amen that's good as
[1:39:52] musicians come I just have one more
[1:39:54] quote I'd like to read to you it's a
[1:39:57] long one but it's a good
[1:40:00] one the prophet says standing some time
[1:40:03] ago I was standing at Gary Indiana where
[1:40:06] they taken me through the big Gary steel
[1:40:08] mills and I was very much alarmed when I
[1:40:10] was watching the superintendent taking
[1:40:12] me up and he was showing me all around
[1:40:15] the place and he said I was watching
[1:40:17] them in a little whistle tooted 5
[1:40:19] minutes before quinting time I notic
[1:40:21] every man taking his apron off and
[1:40:23] laying it up on his machine and right
[1:40:26] out through around his Lads and things
[1:40:27] he was sweeping out in the aisle a bunch
[1:40:29] of shavings that had been collected from
[1:40:31] the material he was working on and he
[1:40:33] swept them all out in the aisle and he
[1:40:35] said I'll show you something here rever
[1:40:37] brandom I said all right then he walked
[1:40:39] back to a little place and the main
[1:40:41] whistle blowed all the men went out
[1:40:43] everybody was clear from the building we
[1:40:45] were left standing alone and he pressed
[1:40:47] a button and way back in the back I
[1:40:48] heard a something Thunder and Roar and
[1:40:51] bur coming down and I thought what is
[1:40:53] that after a while he said now you stand
[1:40:55] aside so I stood
[1:40:57] aside he said I seen a track coming down
[1:41:00] through there and when it did here come
[1:41:02] a great magnet coming down through there
[1:41:05] and as the magnet passed down through
[1:41:07] the line I begin to notice those
[1:41:08] shavings flying up to meet it like that
[1:41:11] the metal shavings and those each one of
[1:41:13] those metal shavings despite the size
[1:41:16] they were still Ste they were still
[1:41:19] attracted to that magnet
[1:41:21] said I noticed some of them didn't come
[1:41:23] up and I noticed several pieces of iron
[1:41:25] didn't come up and the magnet went on
[1:41:27] back over in the into the Capa and
[1:41:29] dropped all this stuff down into the
[1:41:30] Capa and it was melted and made over
[1:41:32] again and I said well why didn't it all
[1:41:35] rise up I said I see some shavings he
[1:41:38] said Reverend brandham we make some
[1:41:40] aluminum parts here he said all those
[1:41:42] aluminum pieces are not magnetized to
