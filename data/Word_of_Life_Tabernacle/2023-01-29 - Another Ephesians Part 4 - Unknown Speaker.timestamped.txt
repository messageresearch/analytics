[33:55] together
[33:56] he hath raised us up aren't you glad for
[34:00] that
[34:00] and made us
[34:02] sit together
[34:04] in Heavenly places
[34:07] in Christ Jesus I pray the Lord would
[34:09] add his Blessing to the word you may be
[34:11] seated
[34:15] we've been talking about Ephesians and
[34:17] another Ephesians and this is where I
[34:19] have taken that from it's from The God
[34:23] Who is rich in Mercy brother Branham
[34:25] says this he says now then we find out
[34:27] that we've come to another Ephesians
[34:30] another Ephesus now he said where that
[34:33] in our intellectual denominations and so
[34:36] forth and all of our educational
[34:38] programs has come to its Jordan has come
[34:42] to its Jordans in other words it was
[34:44] ineffective to carry Us in to the land
[34:48] where we could manifest all of the word
[34:50] of God we could follow it to the Border
[34:54] we could or the denominations could
[34:56] carry us so far but this message was a
[34:59] coming out message and a going in
[35:01] message so there had to be a coming out
[35:04] of the denominational Egypt and there
[35:07] had to be a going in on into the land
[35:10] and what what it means to go into the
[35:12] land is actually to manifest the word
[35:15] word of God that was spoken by a prophet
[35:17] we're not here just to follow or just to
[35:20] just to identify or just to sympathize
[35:24] with the prophet but we're here to
[35:26] actually become what a prophet said and
[35:29] so Moses he said I'm leading you to a
[35:31] land flowing with milk and honey but
[35:33] when they got to the Jordan they had to
[35:35] go in and become what Moses said they
[35:37] would be they had to go in and and
[35:40] become what they were supposed to be and
[35:42] in doing that we found out that there
[35:44] was a spiritual battle that would then
[35:46] take place and a spiritual wickedness in
[35:49] high places would try to keep the people
[35:52] from from coming into the land and from
[35:55] making their entrance into the land that
[35:57] that's where we're at today we're in
[35:59] that spiritual battle so he says our
[36:01] Deni our educational program has come to
[36:05] its Jordan then we must have an
[36:08] Ephesians again
[36:10] he said we must have an exodus to come
[36:13] out and to go into for the Rapture so
[36:17] keep that in your mind now as we
[36:18] progress and we've been dealing with the
[36:20] book of Ephesians now Ephesians places
[36:23] the believer as Joshua placed the
[36:26] Israelites and if you look at the book
[36:28] of Ephesians you'll find that there's
[36:31] actually a a progression to the book and
[36:34] if you read through it carefully and and
[36:36] prayerfully you'll find that in chapter
[36:38] one through three that there are certain
[36:40] principles that are set out to us we
[36:42] we're told we're seated in Heavenly
[36:45] places in Christ and all of the things
[36:48] that that God has done for us in that
[36:51] way and we find that that there's
[36:53] election there and there's adoption
[36:55] there and we've come to a place of
[36:57] understanding of who we are and he's
[37:00] bringing us to a place this is who you
[37:03] are in Christ and we found that he
[37:05] couldn't deal with the Corinthians the
[37:07] same way just kind of catching you up
[37:09] for a minute this morning he couldn't
[37:11] deal with the Corinthians the same way
[37:13] and so he had to deal with them he had
[37:16] to set the gifts in order and things
[37:17] like that but the Ephesians were right
[37:19] where they needed to be to be taught the
[37:21] word brother random said they were it
[37:23] was someone he could teach the word to
[37:25] and that's who we want to be this
[37:26] morning someone who can be taught the
[37:29] word aren't you glad to be a people like
[37:31] that today
[37:33] so now you come into Ephesians and again
[37:36] chapter one through three there's those
[37:37] principles laid out and those Mysteries
[37:39] revealed in chapter four we find he
[37:43] begins to deal with the individual walk
[37:45] and he begins to deal with our position
[37:47] in the body of course just like Joshua
[37:49] would have said the tribes in their
[37:51] order he sets the five ministerial gifts
[37:54] in their order and what they're supposed
[37:57] to be and we won't deal with that this
[37:59] morning we'll deal with it some other
[38:00] time but I want to kind of fast forward
[38:02] this morning it just been on my heart
[38:04] and I want to deal with this part in
[38:07] chapter 5 especially and then he goes on
[38:10] in verse six and we'll deal with that at
[38:11] some time in the future if the Lord is
[38:14] willing but now we're dealing with
[38:16] chapter five where there had to be a
[38:18] teaching with Family Life there had to
[38:21] be a setting in order when it come to
[38:24] family life and the reason that had to
[38:25] be is because the Ephesians remember
[38:28] we're a new generation they were people
[38:31] who were not uh were not God and Jewish
[38:34] principles of living that were not
[38:36] taught under the law and so they come up
[38:38] under an influence of of a worldly
[38:41] theology a worldly idea of how the home
[38:44] ought to be and this is what I want to
[38:46] kind of establish to us this morning
[38:49] that there's an order of God that he
[38:51] wants the home to be a certain way
[38:53] and if we'll do that and we'll follow
[38:55] that and we'll let the Holy Spirit
[38:57] manifest that in our life our lives can
[38:59] be happy and we can actually we can
[39:02] actually live in such a way that even if
[39:05] there were no heaven to gain or Hell to
[39:07] Shone or or no truth to any of that at
[39:10] all which we believe it is truth but
[39:11] even if there was not we can live in
[39:13] such a way that we we would be so happy
[39:16] to live this way because it's just the
[39:18] way God intended for us to be and we
[39:21] wouldn't want to go back to anything
[39:22] else I was talking to brother Cosman
[39:24] yesterday why would we want to go back
[39:25] to denominationalism well and we've seen
[39:28] that we've been there and we know what
[39:30] that entails I don't want to go back I
[39:32] want to press on into the promises of
[39:34] God
[39:35] and so the message of the hour brings us
[39:38] back to an Ephesians of placing the
[39:41] family where it's supposed to be
[39:44] and so we can know what what position we
[39:46] should feel as husbands and wives and
[39:49] sons and daughters and in the family and
[39:51] how we should act now again Ephesus was
[39:54] influenced by The Grecian and Roman
[39:56] cultures they they were a new generation
[40:00] of people that come in and so Paul's got
[40:03] to teach them and he sums up the culture
[40:06] of that world in Romans chapter one
[40:07] we'll go there for just a moment and you
[40:11] just bear with me this morning I you
[40:13] know if you're still here after dealing
[40:16] with what we've dealt with with the air
[40:17] conditioning and the and the smell the
[40:21] last couple of weeks then praise God I
[40:23] think you're going to stick it out
[40:25] so um we just had something crawl up in
[40:29] there and die but we're going to take
[40:30] care of it praise God whenever we find
[40:32] it we're going to take care of it
[40:35] so Romans chapter 1 deals with you just
[40:38] got to acknowledge the elephant in the
[40:40] room sometimes
[40:42] Romans chapter 1 and verse 18 Paul's
[40:44] dealing with the culture of the world
[40:45] and how it got to this place and I want
[40:49] us to understand this morning I want to
[40:51] be very direct about this the culture of
[40:54] the world today is Antichrist
[40:57] it's Antichrist
[40:59] and we don't want to get caught up we
[41:02] don't want to be odd just to be odd
[41:03] brother Branham Todd is sad and we don't
[41:05] want to be odd just to be different but
[41:07] the culture of the world has gone so far
[41:10] off that a person coming out of the
[41:13] world or even raised up in church that
[41:15] if you are exposed to Hollywood you're
[41:18] exposed to the world and we all are on
[41:20] some level there's such an influence of
[41:22] the world that is pulled completely off
[41:24] of what God intended for the family to
[41:27] be
[41:28] and so when we come in we're saved we by
[41:31] the power of God our sins are put on the
[41:34] sea of his forgetfulness as we preached
[41:36] about a couple of weeks ago it's it's as
[41:38] though we'd never done it in the first
[41:39] place and we did it in ignorance and
[41:41] there was an offering for a sin offering
[41:43] for ignorance aren't you glad for that
[41:45] and so the sin offering for ignorance
[41:47] covered us and and we found that uh we
[41:51] were we were brought into this but yet
[41:53] we still have to be taught how that God
[41:55] wants us or expects us to act it's not
[41:58] the holy ghost in your life leads you in
[42:00] many different ways but one of the ways
[42:02] that he leads you is by listening to the
[42:05] word of God and then following that word
[42:08] and so much of our Lives could be
[42:10] affected and could be could be changed
[42:13] and could be made better if we would
[42:15] just do what we know is right to do it
[42:17] and just what's been revealed to us we
[42:19] just follow that
[42:22] so there's a certain way that the world
[42:24] is and this is how Paul and I'll just
[42:26] run through this quickly but so we would
[42:29] understand this morning Romans chapter 1
[42:30] and verse 18 for the wrath of God is
[42:33] revealed from Heaven against all
[42:34] ungodliness and unrighteousness of men
[42:37] who hold the truth in unrighteousness
[42:41] because that which may be known of God
[42:43] is manifesting them for God has showed
[42:46] it unto them
[42:47] so he says the invisible things of him
[42:50] from the creation of the world are
[42:52] clearly seen being understood by the
[42:54] things that are made so we see creation
[42:55] alone is enough to make you guilty
[42:58] because it tells you there's a God
[43:02] right just the fact that there's a
[43:04] heaven and there's the stars and there's
[43:06] there's clouds and there's there's an
[43:08] earth and it got here is enough
[43:11] that's why atheism it takes a lot of
[43:13] faith to believe this just come from
[43:15] nothing
[43:16] so the average person would believe
[43:18] naturally that there was some creator
[43:21] that made it
[43:22] so now he says that being understood by
[43:25] the things that are made even his
[43:26] eternal power and godhead so that they
[43:28] are without excuse because that when
[43:31] they knew God they glorified him not as
[43:34] God either were thankful it's
[43:37] interesting that that he puts that in
[43:38] there they were not thankful it become
[43:41] common to him
[43:42] we don't want to ever let it become
[43:44] common to us this message that we have
[43:47] this word that's come to us we don't
[43:50] want to ever let it become common where
[43:52] it's just something we do and something
[43:53] we say but Lord let it be the the value
[43:56] of her life let it be the Forefront of
[43:58] everything we do
[44:01] so now he says that they are without
[44:04] excuse they they were not thankful but
[44:06] they became vain in their imaginations
[44:08] their foolish heart was darkened
[44:11] and professing themselves to be wise
[44:14] they became fools that's a strong word
[44:17] but he's actually speaking of that
[44:20] Grecian and Roman culture he's speaking
[44:22] of of uh
[44:24] Aristotle I think is how you say it in
[44:27] Plato and all the different all the
[44:29] different philosophers and all of the
[44:31] scientists they were as proud of their
[44:33] men as we are proud of ours today
[44:36] all the the Bill Gates of the world and
[44:38] the Elon musks of the world and and the
[44:41] different great politicians that were
[44:43] there and the great minds the great
[44:45] scientists of the day they were proud of
[44:48] their scientists and their philosophers
[44:50] and in many ways they were more wise
[44:52] than ours are today
[44:54] they were they had they had a lot many
[44:56] things that but but professing
[44:58] themselves to be wise they they studied
[45:00] human nature they've studied animals
[45:02] they studied botany life they studied
[45:04] all those things and yet in doing so
[45:06] they didn't come up with thanks to God
[45:08] but they come up with a system of
[45:10] man-made religion
[45:12] so now he says professing themselves to
[45:15] be wise they became fools
[45:17] and changed the glory of the
[45:20] uncomfortable God
[45:21] into an image made like to corruptable
[45:24] man
[45:25] we don't worship man
[45:28] right we don't worship a man period no
[45:30] matter who the man is
[45:32] we do not worship a man so because they
[45:35] changed the glory of God into a man
[45:37] and to birds and four-footed beasts and
[45:40] creeping things notice how it descends
[45:42] lower and lower it doesn't happen all at
[45:45] once
[45:46] right it doesn't happen just over even
[45:49] in a generation but it happens over time
[45:52] solely and we can see this nation which
[45:54] was founded on Christian principles
[45:56] which is actually following into that
[45:58] same pathway that it's becoming worse
[46:00] and worse and worse until eventually the
[46:03] very thing that's being worshiped is the
[46:05] lowest form of of thing that you could
[46:07] ever imagine homosexuality let me just
[46:10] be blunt today it's being worshiped in
[46:12] this culture and we have pride month and
[46:14] pride week what's happening to us
[46:17] it's the lowest denominator the creeping
[46:19] thing
[46:21] that's what they worship
[46:23] wherefore God also gave them up to
[46:25] uncleanness through the through the lust
[46:28] of their own Hearts to dishonor their
[46:30] own bodies between themselves
[46:32] and I want to just interject this here
[46:34] idolatry leads to immorality
[46:38] idolatry leads immorality immorality
[46:40] doesn't just happen
[46:42] it starts with idolatry because you you
[46:45] idolize yourself or your pleasure or or
[46:49] the lust or maybe you think you can't
[46:52] fall and you and you lift yourself up
[46:54] idolatry leads to immorality
[46:58] Romans 1 25 who changed the truth of God
[47:01] into a lie and worshiped and served the
[47:04] creature more than the Creator who was
[47:06] blessed forever amen for this cause God
[47:10] gave them up into vile affections
[47:12] for even their women to change the
[47:14] natural use into that which is against
[47:16] nature and likewise also the men leaving
[47:19] the natural use of the woman burned in
[47:21] their lust one toward another I'm just
[47:23] preaching the Bible to you this morning
[47:24] men with men working that which is
[47:27] unseemly receiving in themselves that
[47:29] recompense of their error which was meat
[47:32] and you see AIDS and all the different
[47:33] things that have happened in the natural
[47:35] and also in in the image of a man how
[47:38] that that degrades a man to the point
[47:40] where he's not even recognizable as a
[47:43] man anymore
[47:44] and and so in their own bodies they bear
[47:47] the recompense of that and the shame and
[47:49] the guilt of it because it's not normal
[47:51] right
[47:53] right and we I don't we may get thrown
[47:55] off YouTube for that but it's the truth
[47:59] right now they did not like to retain
[48:02] God in their knowledge
[48:04] God gave them over to a reprobate mind
[48:06] to do those things which are not
[48:09] convenient being filled with all
[48:11] unrighteousness fornication wickedness
[48:13] covetousness and and that
[48:16] unrighteousness that fornication is
[48:18] actually the word pornail which is uh
[48:20] which is covers any sexual sin
[48:23] right outside of marriage you understand
[48:25] that uh God is allowed and honored
[48:28] certain things and anything outside of
[48:31] that is covered under the word
[48:32] fornication in the New Testament
[48:34] wickedness covetousness maliciousness
[48:37] full of Envy murder debate deceit
[48:40] malignity Whispers I love how he brings
[48:43] it on down it's not just the sins of the
[48:45] flesh but the whispers
[48:49] the backbiters
[48:51] haters of God
[48:53] despiteful proud boasters inventors of
[48:57] evil things
[48:58] disobedient to parents oh all the
[49:01] Parents Ought To Say Amen to that one
[49:04] huh without understanding Covenant
[49:06] Breakers without natural affection oh
[49:09] don't we see that today implacable
[49:12] unmerciful who knowing the Judgment of
[49:15] God that they would commit such things
[49:16] are worthy of death not only do the same
[49:18] but have pleasure in them that do them
[49:21] oh church we need to recognize this is
[49:23] the culture of this age this was the
[49:26] culture of that early church and if
[49:27] there's another Ephesians there's
[49:29] another world that we have to we have to
[49:31] come out of just like the Ephesian age
[49:33] was so we're in a first age again this
[49:37] nation has gone down into the decline
[49:38] like Roman the Roman Empire did and
[49:41] we're standing there when the bride has
[49:43] got to come like the first the one that
[49:45] went into the ground if the seed the
[49:46] wind of the ground had to be planted and
[49:48] it's coming up again now and we're
[49:50] living in that age of the ripening of
[49:52] the grain what is the world going to be
[49:54] like it's going to be this
[49:56] come on now this is the age that we live
[49:58] in
[50:00] and Paul said it shouldn't be named
[50:01] among us as Christians
[50:04] right and I
[50:05] I want to be just as open as I can with
[50:09] you about that and we need to we need to
[50:11] do better and yet I understand that
[50:13] people fall people are human people are
[50:15] flesh your flesh doesn't get saved
[50:19] people mess up
[50:20] that's part of it but acknowledge the
[50:23] truth
[50:25] my brother Brandon said you tell your
[50:26] children the truth
[50:28] teach your children the truth what these
[50:31] children understand this culture is not
[50:32] what God intended it to be
[50:36] brother Branham speaks of the culture he
[50:38] says oh you see it's this intellectual
[50:39] day that we're living in education
[50:41] civilization and the Modern Trend of the
[50:44] day is all of the devil
[50:46] that's pretty hard but he explains he's
[50:49] not talking about uh you know grade
[50:51] school education where you go in to
[50:52] learn your math and science but it's the
[50:55] education that is leading to a knowledge
[50:58] against God and it's education that does
[51:02] that but the Bible says you just get
[51:03] farther and farther away from God and
[51:05] again if you need to learn how to become
[51:06] a doctor learn how to become a doctor
[51:08] that that that's that's understandable
[51:10] you have to do that but be careful with
[51:13] the stuff they're trying to teach you I
[51:14] I found it was interesting that they
[51:16] taught in in high school they make you
[51:18] take a psychology course and it's in
[51:20] that psychology and the philosophy and
[51:22] things like that that's where the devil
[51:24] can really get in and begin to work now
[51:25] and so now he says this intellectual day
[51:28] that we're living in education the
[51:30] Modern Trend of the day is all the devil
[51:31] he said civilization of the devil yes
[51:33] sir the Bible said this civilization has
[51:36] death
[51:37] oh that's wonderful there will be no
[51:39] smell like that
[51:42] praise God
[51:45] there will be no death smell
[51:47] no dead things in that Civilization
[51:51] oh I'm so grateful
[51:53] oh my look he said he said it'll not be
[51:56] like this in the other world will we
[51:58] have a civil civilization like this in
[52:00] the other world no sir we'll have a
[52:01] different kind of civilization
[52:04] and he said education all these things
[52:06] there of the devil science again and
[52:08] it's not promoting ignorance but it's
[52:10] the fact that we know that the devil has
[52:12] gotten into these things and worked in
[52:14] Civilization and education he said
[52:17] science perverting the natural things
[52:18] making something else
[52:21] he said look what they've done to you
[52:22] now the readers I just said that young
[52:24] men and young women go through the
[52:25] middle age women and menopause between
[52:27] 20 and 25 years old just hold on for a
[52:30] little bit we'll we'll get where we're
[52:31] going this morning
[52:32] but he said one more generation there'll
[52:34] be nothing to be horrible looking but
[52:36] the creatures will be soft and Mucky
[52:39] we're living there
[52:41] if you've ever had any employees you
[52:43] know that's the truth
[52:48] the world has gone soft
[52:50] look at the Spirit look how the spirit
[52:52] and the church has got hybrid
[52:54] intermarried to the world oh what an
[52:57] hour Fleet children flee
[53:00] amen oh if I could cry it out to you
[53:03] today the same way that a prophet did he
[53:06] said flee to the cross
[53:08] flee to the Cross come to Christ let him
[53:10] lead you you say where will I go where I
[53:12] can hide from these things if I go to
[53:14] the country if I go to the city if we
[53:16] close off our services and just keep
[53:18] everything quiet you can't hide from
[53:20] that where will we go to get away from
[53:22] the culture of this world well I won't
[53:24] have the internet I won't do all this
[53:25] that's fine maybe you shouldn't have it
[53:26] but I'll say this the only place that
[53:29] their safety in is in Christ
[53:31] you better stay in the word in this hour
[53:34] you better guard your heart in this hour
[53:36] because Satan is like a roaring lion and
[53:39] he's the prince of the power of the air
[53:40] but this is the hour remember he was
[53:42] called to Heavenly places but you were
[53:44] called to Heavenly places to sit at the
[53:47] right hand of the son of God
[53:50] are you with me now
[53:52] the Brown says this he said let me
[53:54] prophesy something to you
[53:56] just before it comes to pass
[53:59] the whole world is grouping
[54:02] in insanity
[54:04] grouping I went and listened to that
[54:06] just to make sure that was the word he
[54:07] used it's grouping grouping in insanity
[54:11] and will get worse and worse and worse
[54:14] until there'll be a bunch of maniacs
[54:17] and it's almost that way
[54:20] now
[54:21] this was in 1965.
[54:24] but you know in 1965
[54:27] most of the way you grouped was in
[54:29] person
[54:31] right but I found it was interesting
[54:33] that year a man named Lawrence Roberts
[54:37] made two separate computers in different
[54:39] places
[54:40] talk to each other for the first time
[54:44] it was a precursor to the internet and
[54:46] social media that we have today
[54:48] 1965 that same year and he told us he
[54:52] said the world is groping in insanity
[54:56] and then we as you continue down from
[54:59] then until now it's been a long time ago
[55:01] we found that in 1989 they proposed the
[55:05] idea of a web of information in 1991
[55:08] they created web pages in the software
[55:11] to view them for the first time on the
[55:13] internet I was six years old at that
[55:16] time
[55:16] uh but it wasn't freely available we
[55:19] didn't have it uh at least in the
[55:21] country where we lived and some of you
[55:23] may have first started to adopt those
[55:25] things at that time the first social
[55:27] media was invented in 1997 which proves
[55:30] that we can live without it
[55:33] if we had to
[55:36] Myspace come along in 2003 Facebook in
[55:39] 2004 people grouping finding new ways
[55:43] to group together to think together
[55:49] Snapchat come along in 2011 Tick Tock in
[55:52] 2016. it's brand new but the world is
[55:55] all on it
[55:56] everybody's on it why what what is that
[55:59] and I'm not condemning those things
[56:00] those are just algorithms and tools and
[56:03] and things that there's no nothing evil
[56:05] about the software
[56:07] what's evil is the minds behind it and
[56:10] the minds using it many times
[56:13] and so now you've got uh Instagram and
[56:16] Facebook and Snapchat and Tick Tock
[56:18] you've got so many true social and
[56:20] Twitter and all the different ones and
[56:22] you've got so many that you don't even
[56:24] hardly know I know that's true of myself
[56:26] but if I you end up just using one and
[56:28] the rest of them are just there but then
[56:31] it comes to a point where they're all
[56:33] grouping together and you wonder why can
[56:35] they all suddenly decide to like
[56:37] something or decide to dislike something
[56:39] or decide to put this person out of
[56:41] society the world is grouping in
[56:44] insanity and a prophet told us that
[56:46] before it ever happened
[56:50] but we're not called to that
[56:53] we're not called to take the group think
[56:55] of the world and I know
[56:57] I know you get on these blogs and things
[56:59] and where the mamas get on there and
[57:01] stuff and they they have a certain way
[57:03] and I'm not condemning that this morning
[57:04] and some of it may be good information
[57:06] but don't just take it because somebody
[57:08] said it
[57:10] because a bunch of people agree with it
[57:12] because most of it's not scriptural
[57:16] a great portion of it's not scripture
[57:18] and some of it may be helpful in some
[57:20] way but we need to make sure that it
[57:22] lines up with the world view that we
[57:23] have as Christians that it's not taken
[57:26] us away from that where well it's okay
[57:28] you know you wanna you wanna get a
[57:30] divorce that's okay you you want to have
[57:32] a you want to go out and have multiple
[57:34] husbands that's all right you want to
[57:36] change from a man to a woman that's okay
[57:38] and it doesn't matter we won't judge you
[57:40] doesn't matter what you do and you'll
[57:41] find more people agree with you if you
[57:44] do that if you decided to change your
[57:45] gender tomorrow you'd have more people
[57:47] agree with you than would ever laugh at
[57:49] you
[57:50] or whatever condemn you in any way
[57:54] and I'll be honest with you I'm not
[57:55] going to condemn you but I'll say this
[57:57] you've gone insane
[57:59] you've taken on the insanity of the
[58:02] world
[58:03] and it's a spirit that comes over people
[58:05] you need to break off break that thing
[58:07] away
[58:09] and you see it coming even in message
[58:10] School message churches and in places
[58:13] where it feels like the world is just
[58:15] creeping in and you have to cry out
[58:17] against them say this is not what we
[58:19] were called to be
[58:20] that's the darkness we are the light
[58:23] Paul says I beg you I beseech you
[58:26] therefore Brethren by the mercies of God
[58:28] that you present your bodies a Living
[58:30] Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which
[58:33] is your reasonable service that's just
[58:35] the least you could do be not conformed
[58:37] to this world brother Brandon said it
[58:40] was like that Satan was poor was the
[58:42] spraying poison spray in the atmosphere
[58:44] and the plants he said would begin to
[58:47] wilt and begin to take on that that
[58:49] spray that attitude that influence
[58:52] and he said be not conformed to this
[58:54] world but be it transformed don't you
[58:55] want to be transformed this morning by
[58:58] the renewing of your mind that you may
[59:00] prove what is that good and acceptable
[59:02] and perfect will of God
[59:04] he said brother Brandon said Don't Let
[59:06] The Devil spray you with education and
[59:08] poison and stuff like that
[59:11] you have to be you have to be modern he
[59:13] said you have to be this he said you
[59:14] don't have to be nothing but Sons and
[59:16] Daughters of God
[59:18] don't let Snapchat pressure you into
[59:20] being something else don't let Instagram
[59:23] pressure you into being like everybody
[59:25] else
[59:26] you stay with the word
[59:28] and again I'm not preaching against
[59:29] those things I'm I'm telling you what's
[59:31] out there we need to we need to
[59:33] recognize we need to be awake
[59:35] and recognize where we're at
[59:38] because I haven't even got to what I'm
[59:39] preaching on this morning so
[59:42] oh that that made you quiet didn't it
[59:45] we'll get through it pretty quick now
[59:46] look
[59:49] brother Brandon says you don't have to
[59:51] be nothing but Sons and Daughters of God
[59:52] if you're born to the word you do
[59:54] he said notice that spray if you take a
[59:55] seed a good seed and you spray it it'll
[59:57] kill it and when they spray this
[59:59] denominational stuff over the top of you
[1:00:00] it'll ruin the influence of the original
[1:00:01] word if they tell you you have to do
[1:00:04] this why the other girls do it the other
[1:00:06] men do it don't you believe that
[1:00:08] it'll oh my it'll ruin God's influence
[1:00:11] of his word upon you
[1:00:15] you wonder how could a preacher How
[1:00:17] could a d-school teacher How could a a
[1:00:19] man of God or a woman of God that seems
[1:00:22] to love the Lord with all their heart
[1:00:23] how could they end up involved in
[1:00:25] something like that
[1:00:27] that's not saying that's here okay but
[1:00:29] that's it's out there you've seen it
[1:00:32] how could someone like that end up you
[1:00:35] say Well they're just an exceptionally
[1:00:36] bad person we live in that world
[1:00:39] if you let that spray come over you and
[1:00:41] that that influence come on you and you
[1:00:43] just dwell in that and you just you can
[1:00:45] find on the internet everything you need
[1:00:47] to become become a a horrible person and
[1:00:51] you can be justified in doing it because
[1:00:52] some psychologists and some some doctors
[1:00:55] somebody out there has Justified and
[1:00:57] said it's okay but the word says it's
[1:00:59] not
[1:01:02] he said don't you believe that it'll
[1:01:04] ruin God's influence of his word upon
[1:01:06] you you can only break the word so many
[1:01:07] times
[1:01:09] get to the point where you just walk
[1:01:11] over it and you know it's right and I'm
[1:01:13] not talking about people that are
[1:01:14] struggling with little things there's
[1:01:15] things that happen we're human beings
[1:01:16] but when you deliberately walk across
[1:01:19] the word and you do that and you do it
[1:01:20] it gets easier the second time and the
[1:01:22] third time and the fourth time and
[1:01:23] finally it just don't matter to you
[1:01:28] see this is matching time yeah let me
[1:01:31] move on
[1:01:32] but the man who said you paint your
[1:01:33] steps red and see if the neighbor don't
[1:01:34] paint his steps red
[1:01:36] he said buy Mercury and see if the
[1:01:37] neighbor don't want a Mercury I don't
[1:01:39] think anybody wants the Mercury anymore
[1:01:40] unless it's a classic car by The Herald
[1:01:44] he said they want to match
[1:01:46] he said I don't care whether my pants
[1:01:48] match my coat or my shirt matches my
[1:01:49] suit I want my experience to match God's
[1:01:51] Bible
[1:01:53] he said that's the kind of a match
[1:01:54] Christians ought to have not whether
[1:01:55] Jones has got a big church and I got a
[1:01:57] little one I want Christ
[1:01:59] and that speaks directly to me as a
[1:02:01] minister I I want Christ I don't want to
[1:02:03] look at what everybody else is doing I
[1:02:04] don't want to look at what the world
[1:02:05] does to get people in but the cosmen and
[1:02:07] send them no we want Christ we want to
[1:02:10] stay with the word
[1:02:12] we want our families to match the
[1:02:14] pattern of the word because that's what
[1:02:16] works
[1:02:17] that's what a producing another
[1:02:19] Ephesians in our day it will not be the
[1:02:22] blogs that'll produce another Ephesians
[1:02:24] in your life it will not be the internet
[1:02:26] it will not be Snapchat it will not be
[1:02:28] Instagram but the word will produce
[1:02:30] another efficient
[1:02:33] are you with me this morning
[1:02:37] first John 2 15 love not the world
[1:02:39] neither the things that are in the world
[1:02:40] if any man love the world the love of
[1:02:42] the father is not in him he's talking
[1:02:43] about the world there you say we look at
[1:02:45] that and say well if a person loves to
[1:02:47] paint their face or wear a short skirt
[1:02:49] and and that is true but it's not it's
[1:02:52] not the full meaning of it the world is
[1:02:54] the world order the cosmos
[1:02:56] if you love The Cosmos the way the world
[1:02:58] does things
[1:03:00] that comes down to our attitudes and how
[1:03:02] we treat one another and everything else
[1:03:05] if you love the way you can be ever so
[1:03:07] holiness
[1:03:08] and sit and gossip about people on the
[1:03:10] phone and run people down tell stories
[1:03:12] that you're not sure that it's true
[1:03:15] but you tell it anyway
[1:03:18] I'm getting in trouble this morning
[1:03:20] huh
[1:03:21] love not the world that's the way the
[1:03:23] world does
[1:03:24] they lie about one another we don't do
[1:03:26] that do we
[1:03:30] we don't need to be jealous of the world
[1:03:33] I think sometimes and just being open
[1:03:36] with you this morning sometimes when
[1:03:37] we're raised in the message
[1:03:39] we we only know message churches and we
[1:03:42] we're kind of jealous of the world a
[1:03:44] little bit some of you don't know what
[1:03:46] I'm talking about because you come out
[1:03:47] of the world you don't want nothing to
[1:03:48] do with it but
[1:03:50] but when you're raised in a message home
[1:03:52] sometimes you look out there and think
[1:03:53] man they're they can wear shorts
[1:03:55] they can go to the beach and do whatever
[1:03:56] they want they can they can display
[1:03:58] themselves in any old way and and here I
[1:04:00] am like this and I'm held back
[1:04:03] well first of all we need the Holy Ghost
[1:04:06] make you want to do it or else you're
[1:04:09] just a prisoner right
[1:04:10] you're just a prisoner
[1:04:12] but there's some of that that
[1:04:13] awkwardness you know that kind of
[1:04:14] lingers it's like well I I was
[1:04:17] explaining the other day to a man who
[1:04:18] was a preacher about what we believed
[1:04:21] and and immediately he he connected it
[1:04:23] with a person
[1:04:24] I hate it when they do that
[1:04:27] and you ever notice they don't connect
[1:04:28] it with Godly good people sometimes they
[1:04:30] do I had that happen with Danny Ward one
[1:04:32] time I told him about the message and he
[1:04:33] told me about Danny Ward what a good man
[1:04:35] he was and I thought that's the way it
[1:04:37] ought to be
[1:04:38] but he connected it with some
[1:04:41] preacher somewhere that said well we're
[1:04:44] not exactly that kind
[1:04:48] it kind of a little embarrassment that
[1:04:51] goes along with that we don't need to be
[1:04:52] jealous of the world though
[1:04:54] we have our problems I I'll admit to
[1:04:57] that the the there's people in The Bride
[1:04:58] do bad things but I put this right up
[1:05:00] next to anybody
[1:05:02] I'd put our young people up next to any
[1:05:04] group of young people in the world
[1:05:06] there may be things creep in things
[1:05:08] happen but there is a bride on the Earth
[1:05:10] today there's somebody that's been
[1:05:12] raised up out of dead trespasses and
[1:05:13] says there's another Ephesians going on
[1:05:16] you can be like Balaam if you want to
[1:05:18] look at all the bad things that well
[1:05:19] this is happening this is happening no
[1:05:21] we'll just keep preaching the word and
[1:05:22] plugging along because God will have a
[1:05:24] bride
[1:05:26] we don't need to be jealous of the world
[1:05:29] the world has its own problems
[1:05:33] but Brandon said there's a little door
[1:05:34] in your heart another little door called
[1:05:36] jealousy
[1:05:37] is I don't know whether you Yankees know
[1:05:38] anything about it but down south you
[1:05:39] have a lot of that
[1:05:43] so just a little inferior to the other
[1:05:45] man just a little better than the other
[1:05:46] Church
[1:05:48] God help us today
[1:05:50] if the Joneses paint their steps red you
[1:05:52] got to have yours red oh what a horrible
[1:05:53] Spirit to being a Christian
[1:05:56] why don't you let Christ come in make
[1:05:58] him Lord over that little Spirit Room oh
[1:06:00] selfishness and indifference
[1:06:03] oh my
[1:06:04] God but it's matching time that's the
[1:06:06] pattern of the world it's just the way
[1:06:07] they are we don't want to be that way
[1:06:09] so Paul starts to establish the pattern
[1:06:11] of the way families should be because in
[1:06:14] that we see the mystery of Christ in the
[1:06:16] church
[1:06:17] right you say well I'm a widow I'm alone
[1:06:20] I I don't have a family or there's been
[1:06:23] trouble in my family I'm all by myself
[1:06:24] as a Christian a natural widow or a
[1:06:27] spiritual Widow in that way but this has
[1:06:30] a bearing to you as well and maybe a
[1:06:32] more significant one in this way that
[1:06:34] your head is Christ and you've got to
[1:06:37] recognize that the things that we say
[1:06:39] about the way a man should be or we're
[1:06:42] saying that of Christ and the things we
[1:06:44] say about the way a woman should be
[1:06:46] we're saying that of the Bride
[1:06:48] so this is a mystery concerning Christ
[1:06:50] in the church Ephesians 5 20. he said
[1:06:53] giving thanks always for all things unto
[1:06:55] God and the father in the name of our
[1:06:57] Lord Jesus Christ submitting yourselves
[1:06:59] one to another in the fear of God this
[1:07:04] is important brother Branham says this
[1:07:06] about that scripture he said submit
[1:07:08] yourself congregation submit yourself to
[1:07:11] your pastor
[1:07:12] but he doesn't stop there
[1:07:14] right Pastor submit yourself to your
[1:07:18] congregation
[1:07:19] this is interesting what he's saying is
[1:07:21] you submit yourself to the whole body
[1:07:23] right he said if a little click Rises up
[1:07:25] don't be on either side submit yourself
[1:07:28] to the whole congregation congregation
[1:07:31] he said if you start in a click submit
[1:07:34] yourself to your pastor in the fear of
[1:07:36] God so he said in that way we're not
[1:07:39] supposed to gather together and have a
[1:07:42] little and we don't do that like we've
[1:07:44] not had a problem with that but just so
[1:07:46] that we know we're not supposed to band
[1:07:47] together and spend our time running
[1:07:49] people down even if it's a pastor or one
[1:07:52] another even if it's somebody that's a
[1:07:54] little bit hard we should we should try
[1:07:55] to do our best to draw our Circle big
[1:07:57] enough that that person that's a little
[1:07:59] bit odd or a little bit different we can
[1:08:01] draw them in because they could be as
[1:08:04] much the body of Christ the bride of
[1:08:05] Christ as we are listen he didn't know
[1:08:07] he didn't call everybody to be as
[1:08:08] handsome as me or brother Joel
[1:08:14] not a not everybody's brother Jerome
[1:08:17] back there not every sister is the same
[1:08:20] they're different he likes different
[1:08:22] people and some of them are what we
[1:08:24] would call different or or maybe even
[1:08:26] ugly or use a word like that but that's
[1:08:28] not what God wants to us to see them as
[1:08:31] he wants us to see beyond the face and
[1:08:33] Beyond the weight and Beyond the height
[1:08:35] and see what's on the inside beyond the
[1:08:38] past beyond what they've been and see
[1:08:40] the Inner Man and see there's a child of
[1:08:42] God there
[1:08:44] the truth now verse 22
[1:08:48] oh here we go
[1:08:51] why submit yourselves unto your own
[1:08:53] husbands
[1:08:54] as unto the Lord
[1:08:57] and brother random handles this
[1:08:59] delicately he said how many knows that
[1:09:00] you women
[1:09:01] that's exactly right the Bible said so
[1:09:03] at the beginning it's still the same way
[1:09:07] verse 33
[1:09:08] nevertheless let every one of you in
[1:09:10] particular now we've jumped down to the
[1:09:13] end but I want you to watch this how
[1:09:14] these two verses tie together he said so
[1:09:17] love his wife even as himself and the
[1:09:18] wife see that she reverence her husband
[1:09:21] now watch this
[1:09:22] admit yourself reverence your husband be
[1:09:26] like Sarah who called her husband Lord
[1:09:28] right that's that's hard stuff in a
[1:09:30] feminist Society isn't it
[1:09:32] that's difficult and we've heard those
[1:09:34] things
[1:09:34] preach and maybe maybe in an unbalanced
[1:09:38] way in the past and it affects the way
[1:09:40] that you think about it and I know it's
[1:09:42] hard to hear but it's still the truth of
[1:09:44] God the truth of it is
[1:09:47] and brother Branham explains this
[1:09:49] reverence he said oh for the grace of
[1:09:50] God he would give us understanding of
[1:09:52] such great Mysteries
[1:09:55] that's a great mystery he said we're in
[1:09:57] Ephesians I thought we were going to be
[1:09:59] high and lifted up we are we're seated
[1:10:02] in Heavenly places hearing the message
[1:10:04] that the Ephesians we're hearing
[1:10:08] look he said
[1:10:10] he said uh such great Mysteries as Paul
[1:10:13] Paul spoke here further on down in the
[1:10:14] vision speaking of the husband and wife
[1:10:15] said this is a mystery how the women
[1:10:17] should be in respects to their husband
[1:10:19] he said even the second place I believe
[1:10:21] it is in the entire Bible that reverence
[1:10:23] was ever spoke to said the women the
[1:10:25] woman see that she reverenced her
[1:10:27] husband reverence her husband then a
[1:10:29] husband now watch where he puts this
[1:10:32] leadership starts at the top
[1:10:36] because I'm not actually going to talk
[1:10:37] about the women today in my remaining
[1:10:39] time I'm going to talk about us men
[1:10:41] because leadership in a home starts at
[1:10:44] the top
[1:10:46] if you have listen God Is So set it up
[1:10:49] or if a man cannot control his family
[1:10:52] and his wife and I say control in the
[1:10:55] sense of the just going out into the
[1:10:57] world and running around and doing
[1:10:59] things that they shouldn't do and
[1:11:00] there's no there's no correction there's
[1:11:02] no uh there's no ability to hold on to
[1:11:05] his family if a man can't lead his
[1:11:07] family he said he can't leave the church
[1:11:11] right if his wife doesn't believe that
[1:11:14] he's real
[1:11:15] God help us today
[1:11:17] then no one else is going to believe it
[1:11:19] and I want you to understand men make
[1:11:21] mistakes men have struggles and I have
[1:11:23] the same struggles all of you do because
[1:11:25] I'm a male a human being this flesh is
[1:11:27] not saved and it's just the same brother
[1:11:29] Branham had those same struggles even
[1:11:31] Jesus when he come down on a body of
[1:11:33] Flesh though he was born of a virgin was
[1:11:35] tempted
[1:11:36] by women brother Branham taught us that
[1:11:39] but he didn't never fail never dwelt on
[1:11:42] that thought and that's why we have an
[1:11:44] atonement when we do fall
[1:11:46] that he was one who didn't and he died
[1:11:48] for us
[1:11:49] right and but yet we're called to a
[1:11:51] place where we turn our head where we do
[1:11:53] differently than that and and but it
[1:11:55] always starts at the top there's got to
[1:11:57] be there's got to be a man there's got
[1:11:59] to be somebody who will Who will set
[1:12:02] such an example to his to his wife to
[1:12:04] his family that they will reverence him
[1:12:07] as the son of God
[1:12:08] he said the husband ought to live such a
[1:12:10] life before his wife that his wife could
[1:12:12] reverence him as the Son of God listen
[1:12:14] you may live ever so pure and holy but
[1:12:16] if you're constantly flying off the
[1:12:18] handle and throwing things and and uh
[1:12:21] and calling your wife names listen she's
[1:12:23] not going to reference you as a son of
[1:12:24] God
[1:12:27] are you with me this morning
[1:12:29] you got to take care of that
[1:12:31] but the brown said that anger is
[1:12:32] insanity my notes that you just take
[1:12:35] that for what it's worth
[1:12:38] he said if he doesn't live that kind of
[1:12:40] life well then of course she wouldn't
[1:12:41] reverence him because she knows what
[1:12:43] he's made of
[1:12:45] yeah but when it is a man that is
[1:12:47] reverent man
[1:12:49] reverent and clean with his wife and
[1:12:52] before his family a real servant of God
[1:12:54] then the women children and all should
[1:12:56] respect that servant of God
[1:12:59] with reverence
[1:13:01] now watch Ephesians 5 23 he goes into
[1:13:05] that for the husband is the head of the
[1:13:07] wife
[1:13:09] even as Christ is the head of the church
[1:13:11] and he is the savior of the body
[1:13:16] think about your role today as men I
[1:13:19] know this is disquieting in some level
[1:13:21] but we'll go through and talk about the
[1:13:23] family a little bit and then we'll get
[1:13:24] off of that I try not to preach every
[1:13:26] service on it but this is the age we
[1:13:27] live in we need to hear it
[1:13:29] this is God's pattern for us it's meant
[1:13:33] right this is an Ephesians pattern not a
[1:13:36] pattern of of of marriage and divorce
[1:13:39] and remarriage and breaking up homes and
[1:13:41] and living in uh in Corinthians they
[1:13:44] were a man was living with his with his
[1:13:46] stepmother and all of the things that
[1:13:47] went on there and and he Paul's not
[1:13:49] dealing with that with the Ephesians he
[1:13:51] said this is the high place that you've
[1:13:53] been called to husbands you that that
[1:13:55] love your wives he said I want you I
[1:13:57] want to command you love your wife I
[1:13:58] want to tell you you're the head of the
[1:14:00] home I want to tell you you're the
[1:14:02] savior of the body
[1:14:04] right huh
[1:14:06] therefore as the church is subject under
[1:14:08] Christ so let the wise be to their own
[1:14:09] husbands and everything
[1:14:12] boy that's hard to take boy and get any
[1:14:14] amens at all but it's still the word
[1:14:16] I warned brother Cosman last night I
[1:14:19] said oh Lord you're dealing with me on
[1:14:20] something I'm gonna have to preach it
[1:14:21] and you just Lord help us today
[1:14:24] sometimes the pastor's got to preach and
[1:14:26] then brother cosmon will come and make
[1:14:27] you all happy this afternoon
[1:14:30] now he said now he said husbands
[1:14:34] now watch where he takes this husbands
[1:14:37] love
[1:14:39] your wives
[1:14:41] it's not husbands when you feel like it
[1:14:45] when it's convenient
[1:14:48] when they're when they are in their
[1:14:50] place that's not what he says
[1:14:52] love your wives
[1:14:54] and then he tells you how to love your
[1:14:56] wife he said even as Christ also loved
[1:14:58] the church and gave himself for it
[1:15:03] the man is uniquely commanded to to love
[1:15:06] his wife the word there is agape
[1:15:09] he's not commanded to filio his wife
[1:15:12] you understand if you didn't love her
[1:15:13] you wouldn't have got married naturally
[1:15:16] right right there's something there I
[1:15:17] hope not
[1:15:19] there's something there some attraction
[1:15:20] but that's not what he's talking about
[1:15:23] he's talking about Agape yeah husbands
[1:15:26] agape love with God's love
[1:15:31] love with the highest kind of love
[1:15:34] your wives
[1:15:36] now brother Branham explains the
[1:15:37] difference between filio and agapo love
[1:15:39] he said filio love would make you shoot
[1:15:41] a man for insulting your wife
[1:15:45] agape love would make you pray for his
[1:15:47] lost soul
[1:15:49] he said that's the difference
[1:15:51] in another place brother Branham says
[1:15:53] that if you were unmarried and you were
[1:15:55] you were going with a girl and you
[1:15:57] really loved her you really wanted to I
[1:15:59] wanted to have her as a wife
[1:16:01] but you knew she would be happier with
[1:16:03] somebody else
[1:16:05] he said you you would let her go
[1:16:08] if you had agape love
[1:16:11] yeah that's rough isn't it no not after
[1:16:13] you're married obviously
[1:16:15] brothers that opportunity is gone
[1:16:20] huh
[1:16:22] but you see what I'm saying it's a
[1:16:24] different kind of love
[1:16:26] feel your love would make you want to
[1:16:27] take a rifle and shoot them
[1:16:30] a couple of make you want to pray for
[1:16:31] them
[1:16:32] men agape love your wives
[1:16:37] agape love is elective love
[1:16:39] not a love of emotion
[1:16:42] I love you because you're my wife not
[1:16:45] because you wash the dishes
[1:16:47] not because you clean the house
[1:16:50] not because you look good
[1:16:53] or don't look good
[1:16:55] I love you
[1:17:00] brother Curtis I thought of you I saw a
[1:17:02] news story about a man been married to
[1:17:03] his wife for 80 years
[1:17:06] and you guys aren't that far off you got
[1:17:08] a few more years
[1:17:11] but they've been married for 80 years
[1:17:13] and and she's you know he's talking he
[1:17:15] said you know she's she's always been
[1:17:17] the boss and
[1:17:19] well here we go
[1:17:21] since she's always been kind of bossy
[1:17:23] and he was teasing her about that and
[1:17:24] and at the end he said something just
[1:17:26] broke my heart
[1:17:27] he said
[1:17:28] he said you know he said I just want to
[1:17:30] make her happy
[1:17:33] he said I'm so in love with her I just
[1:17:35] want to make her happy they've been
[1:17:36] married for 80 years
[1:17:40] that's the kind of love it takes to stay
[1:17:41] married
[1:17:42] but look this is just a couple I don't
[1:17:44] know if they're Christians or not or
[1:17:46] went to church I don't know if that's
[1:17:48] possible in a human realm what is
[1:17:51] possible in the realm of the agape love
[1:17:54] that were commanded to love with
[1:17:58] so it's not a love of emotion it's a
[1:18:00] sacrificial love
[1:18:02] a Redemptive love and an unselfish love
[1:18:07] so we are commanded to love our wives
[1:18:09] three ways I want you to think about it
[1:18:10] write it down if you're if you're
[1:18:11] keeping notes we're to love our wives
[1:18:13] sacrificially redemptively unselfishly
[1:18:18] in Ephesians 5 25 he said are you still
[1:18:21] with me this morning I I got a few more
[1:18:23] minutes and we'll try to get through it
[1:18:25] sacrificially it's in Ephesians 5 25
[1:18:28] husbands love your wives even as even as
[1:18:31] Christ loved the church and gave
[1:18:34] he gave himself
[1:18:37] for it
[1:18:39] the idea is love your wise Paul is
[1:18:42] referring primarily to sacrificial
[1:18:44] actions for the benefit of the wife
[1:18:47] and the model for this kind of love is
[1:18:49] Christ's death on the cross brother
[1:18:51] random takes that back into the church
[1:18:53] realm now for those of you maybe that
[1:18:54] aren't married or you say well brother
[1:18:56] Ben we don't have any problems with that
[1:18:57] well good but you're part of a church
[1:18:59] family he said now he said wouldn't you
[1:19:01] all like to have a real Bible Church
[1:19:03] wouldn't we all like that I believe we
[1:19:05] have one but he said a real Bible Church
[1:19:07] where all the spiritual gifts were set
[1:19:09] in order everything making manifests
[1:19:11] just exactly the way it should be
[1:19:13] wouldn't that be wonderful he said now
[1:19:15] you're going to have to sacrifice
[1:19:17] not money
[1:19:20] you're going to have to sacrifice what
[1:19:22] some of your own ideas
[1:19:27] well I wanted this to happen you don't
[1:19:28] have to sacrifice some of your own ideas
[1:19:31] you're going to have to even the
[1:19:33] preacher has to do that by the way
[1:19:35] you're going to have to sacrifice some
[1:19:37] time in prayer
[1:19:39] well I want a Bible Church don't you
[1:19:40] yeah you're going to have to sacrifice
[1:19:43] maybe a stubborn will to break down in
[1:19:46] humility he said the whole Christian
[1:19:48] move is sacrificial he that will follow
[1:19:51] me let him deny himself take up his
[1:19:53] cross follow me daily he said he said is
[1:19:56] that right how often do you have to
[1:19:57] sacrifice every day
[1:20:00] Paul said he died daily every day he
[1:20:03] died this is sacrifice picking up your
[1:20:06] cross
[1:20:07] and dying
[1:20:09] sacrifice yourself like
[1:20:11] he did love your wife like
[1:20:14] he did
[1:20:16] sacrifice our will to God's will and I'm
[1:20:18] preaching to myself this morning as well
[1:20:20] because I'm as again I'm as much human
[1:20:22] As You Are
[1:20:24] sacrifice your will to God's will for
[1:20:26] the benefit of your wife
[1:20:29] you notice he doesn't say sacrifice your
[1:20:30] will to your wife's will although at
[1:20:32] times that's necessary when her will is
[1:20:34] also the will of God
[1:20:36] but sacrifice your will to God's will
[1:20:38] for the benefit of your wife
[1:20:41] and so even when it comes to biblical
[1:20:43] things and and godly things
[1:20:45] your wife has to be with you and the
[1:20:48] measure of a leadership of a man is how
[1:20:49] many people he can bring with him into
[1:20:51] the same thing that he was going to do
[1:20:53] anyway
[1:20:54] are you with me now it's not it's not
[1:20:56] I'm doing it in spite that's not a
[1:20:58] leader I'm doing in spite of what they
[1:21:00] say
[1:21:01] that's not a leader a leader is someone
[1:21:03] who brings them with him
[1:21:05] right now
[1:21:07] sacrifice yourself like he did he gave
[1:21:09] what did he give
[1:21:10] not diamond rings
[1:21:13] not not gold not silver
[1:21:16] what did he give he gave himself
[1:21:19] he gave himself
[1:21:21] and yet we want to we want to give
[1:21:24] things to our wife brother Brandon says
[1:21:26] this he said if you love your wife you
[1:21:28] love to do something for her
[1:21:30] and all the wives said
[1:21:35] but look he gave himself not just things
[1:21:38] you see God had already given us his
[1:21:41] universe
[1:21:42] we read about that in Romans 1 he had
[1:21:44] already provided a home for us
[1:21:45] he already made all things beautiful
[1:21:48] but then he came himself
[1:21:51] he did not leave us as the bride without
[1:21:54] personal a personal relationship with
[1:21:57] him he came down in human flesh that is
[1:22:00] the mystery of the godhead he come down
[1:22:02] in a human body and he fellowship with
[1:22:04] us
[1:22:05] your wife doesn't just need your salary
[1:22:08] he does she doesn't just need the things
[1:22:09] you buy for her she needs you
[1:22:13] are you with me now now think about that
[1:22:15] spiritually we don't just need the
[1:22:18] things that God gives us the benefits of
[1:22:20] being a Christian we need intimate
[1:22:23] fellowship with him
[1:22:25] or you hear me today we don't need just
[1:22:28] a form the Baptists have a form the
[1:22:31] Methodist everybody's got a form but we
[1:22:33] don't need a form we need him
[1:22:36] we need Christ and we're happy for the
[1:22:39] gifts we're glad when the when they come
[1:22:41] we want to partake of the good things
[1:22:43] that he's given us but we need him most
[1:22:46] of all we want to fellowship with him
[1:22:48] that's why we come to church that's why
[1:22:50] we sacrifice that's why we put up with
[1:22:52] things why because we come to the house
[1:22:54] of God because we think Lord I want to
[1:22:56] Fellowship more with you we fellowship
[1:22:58] with him here we fellowship with him at
[1:23:00] home we fellowship with him on the job
[1:23:02] why he's always there with us he said
[1:23:03] I'll never leave you I'll never forsake
[1:23:05] you what kind of a husband do you have
[1:23:07] church what kind of a husband do you
[1:23:09] have you have a husband that that is set
[1:23:12] the perfect example he said I'll never
[1:23:14] leave you
[1:23:16] amen
[1:23:17] I'm so glad for his grace
[1:23:20] that's the kind of love he wants us to
[1:23:21] have
[1:23:24] not where we just tolerate one another
[1:23:28] yeah that's not what he's called us to
[1:23:29] yes
[1:23:30] it's called us to give ourselves
[1:23:33] sacrificially
[1:23:35] to the one that we chose
[1:23:37] to be our wife
[1:23:40] your wife doesn't just want as we said
[1:23:42] your money or you're good she wants you
[1:23:44] had a sacrificial level work their
[1:23:46] fingers to the Bone to give their wife
[1:23:48] a handful on purpose
[1:23:50] remember Boaz even before they were
[1:23:52] married
[1:23:53] he made sure that he dropped a handful
[1:23:56] on purpose
[1:23:57] and brother Brandon said God does that
[1:23:59] for us
[1:24:00] he said a good meeting
[1:24:02] the presence of the Lord just come in he
[1:24:04] wouldn't have to do that we fill his
[1:24:06] presence when we're sitting here in the
[1:24:07] church service he wouldn't have to do
[1:24:08] that but he does it but the cause why
[1:24:10] does he do it for us it's a handful on
[1:24:12] purpose Revelation at opportune times in
[1:24:15] our lives
[1:24:17] strength when we need it
[1:24:19] I know you get weak and you get tired
[1:24:21] and you get worried and you think well
[1:24:22] I'm not going to be able to make it
[1:24:23] we're not going to there's no way that
[1:24:25] we can make it there's a handful on
[1:24:26] purpose for you this morning there's
[1:24:28] strength for you grab a hold of it take
[1:24:30] advantage of it spend time with him
[1:24:33] let him let him drop handfuls of purpose
[1:24:36] he wants to give give good gifts to his
[1:24:38] children
[1:24:40] he wants to do that he said I can't be
[1:24:42] this I can't do that brother Ben I can't
[1:24:44] you let him let him make you that
[1:24:47] listen he
[1:24:48] he gave sacrificially he gave
[1:24:50] redemptively in Ephesians 5 26 that he
[1:24:53] might sanctify and cleanse it with the
[1:24:54] washing of Water by the word
[1:24:56] that he might present it to himself a
[1:24:59] glorious church not having spot a
[1:25:01] wrinkle or any such thing but that it
[1:25:03] should be holy and without blemish
[1:25:06] he takes a wife who is unworthy and
[1:25:09] redeems her
[1:25:13] see this is a higher call than taking a
[1:25:15] worthy wife and loving her for her
[1:25:17] worthiness
[1:25:19] and we should take worthy wives right
[1:25:22] but but it chose our character but he
[1:25:24] took a wife
[1:25:26] who was unworthy
[1:25:28] and redeemed her
[1:25:32] like Adam leaving the garden why because
[1:25:34] he was God's son he was God's son and
[1:25:37] though he was broken though he had
[1:25:39] sinned though he'd done all of those
[1:25:40] things yet he walked out of the garden
[1:25:42] with Eve why did he do it because he
[1:25:44] loved his wife
[1:25:47] so brother Brown taught us he went out
[1:25:49] with her
[1:25:50] sacrificially
[1:25:52] he left the garden look at Hosea chapter
[1:25:54] one you know the story of Hosea the
[1:25:56] prophet it's an odd story really
[1:25:58] verse 2 it says the beginning of the
[1:26:00] word of the Lord by Hosea and the Lord
[1:26:02] said to Jose go take unto thee a wife of
[1:26:04] ordoms and children of whoredoms
[1:26:07] you say brother Ben I'm going to go do
[1:26:08] that you better have had God speak
[1:26:10] audibly to you
[1:26:12] and saw a vision
[1:26:14] and be a prophet
[1:26:20] but look that's
[1:26:23] going to illustrate his Redemptive love
[1:26:26] the Redemptive quality of agape love he
[1:26:29] said go take a wife
[1:26:31] huh that doesn't know anything but
[1:26:34] leaving one man and going to another
[1:26:39] he said for the land has committed great
[1:26:41] horde and he said he said Jose I want
[1:26:43] you to experience what I've experienced
[1:26:45] because Israel was a chronic backsider
[1:26:48] back and forth and she was always that
[1:26:52] way she never would but he loved her
[1:26:53] anyway it was his people
[1:26:56] and Jose's wife was the same way and she
[1:26:59] finally left him and ended up a slave on
[1:27:01] The Auction Block and you find in Hosea
[1:27:03] chapter 3 and verse 1 it said then said
[1:27:05] the Lord unto me after she left after
[1:27:08] she'd went out done everything she could
[1:27:09] do the Lord said unto me go yet
[1:27:13] love
[1:27:15] that's hard
[1:27:19] it's really hard
[1:27:21] I said go yet that yeah it's a big word
[1:27:24] it's only three letters but it's a big
[1:27:25] word yeah
[1:27:28] she's already done everything she could
[1:27:29] possibly do
[1:27:31] this is agape love
[1:27:33] yeah this is Redemptive love except my
[1:27:35] wife didn't wash the dishes I'm going to
[1:27:36] divorce her where'd you get that baloney
[1:27:38] from
[1:27:40] not from the scriptures
[1:27:43] well I found out something about my wife
[1:27:44] from you know long ago well you're going
[1:27:46] to have to deal with that but you use
[1:27:48] that as an excuse for divorce you're no
[1:27:50] better than the Pharisees before Jesus
[1:27:51] came
[1:27:52] so divorce their wives for any reason
[1:27:55] go ahead
[1:27:57] I know that's strong
[1:27:59] but I I know how it's been around here
[1:28:01] it's just well man can and a woman can't
[1:28:03] so we'll just go do it
[1:28:06] the Bible says God hates divorce
[1:28:08] God hates putting away
[1:28:11] and I understand some of you've been
[1:28:12] through that and that's hard I I get
[1:28:14] that some of you the innocent parties
[1:28:15] some of you may have caused it there's
[1:28:17] still Grace in the in the mind of God
[1:28:19] you understand God the grace go there's
[1:28:22] no sin that if you're if you're
[1:28:24] repentant and you're willing to go to
[1:28:25] God but don't do that thing again
[1:28:28] don't make it worse
[1:28:30] don't compound it
[1:28:32] yeah look at the love the Redemptive
[1:28:34] love that Jose had
[1:28:36] the Lord wanted Jose to experience this
[1:28:38] he said go yet
[1:28:39] love a woman beloved of her friend
[1:28:41] yet an adulteress
[1:28:43] according to the love of the Lord
[1:28:45] towards the children of Israel who look
[1:28:47] to other gods and love slagons of wine
[1:28:49] so he goes down to the Side Market and
[1:28:51] he said so I bought her to me verse two
[1:28:54] I bought her to me for 15 pieces of
[1:28:57] silver
[1:28:58] and a homer of barley at a half home
[1:29:00] where barley it's the price of a Slave
[1:29:03] and I said unto her Thou shalt abide for
[1:29:06] me many days
[1:29:07] thou shall not play the Harlot thou
[1:29:09] shall not be for another man so will I
[1:29:11] also be yes for thee
[1:29:14] you see the concept it's not you did it
[1:29:16] so now it gives me an excuse to do it
[1:29:20] right but it's go go yet love the woman
[1:29:22] and say I'm going to be true to you you
[1:29:24] weren't true to me but I'm going to be
[1:29:26] true to you
[1:29:29] we don't even it's hard to even
[1:29:30] comprehend that kind of love
[1:29:32] that's what the way God loved us
[1:29:35] see he was manifesting agape love to her
[1:29:38] unmerited favor not because she deserved
[1:29:40] it but because he chose her to be his
[1:29:42] wife
[1:29:43] this is a great mystery
[1:29:45] this is redeeming love
[1:29:47] when the dishes haven't been done and
[1:29:49] the children are crying and when the
[1:29:50] house is a mess and the food is burning
[1:29:54] redeeming Love Gone to sins
[1:29:57] oh we're getting down where we live now
[1:30:00] redeeming love come to sins and you saw
[1:30:02] a prophet of God step out of his place
[1:30:05] as a prophet and a minister and preacher
[1:30:07] put on an apron and walk down with his
[1:30:09] wife
[1:30:10] it's the same concept yeah redeeming
[1:30:13] love it wasn't his job but he did it
[1:30:16] anyway he had other better things to do
[1:30:18] but he did it anyway aren't you glad God
[1:30:21] loves you like that he doesn't leave you
[1:30:23] and say I got preachers to deal with I
[1:30:25] got other people I can talk to I got
[1:30:27] great people in the message but he comes
[1:30:29] to you and he speaks to you individually
[1:30:31] and he deals with you in such a way that
[1:30:34] you don't even you think why would you
[1:30:36] spend this time with me why would you
[1:30:38] let me feel your presence why would you
[1:30:40] allow me into the innermost being of
[1:30:42] your heart why would you let me know
[1:30:44] your secrets because of the love that he
[1:30:46] has for you Redemptive love
[1:30:50] when all of this is going on
[1:30:52] it takes her place and does for her what
[1:30:54] she cannot do
[1:30:56] herself
[1:30:58] and that ought to make a wife reverence
[1:31:00] her husband and want to do the very best
[1:31:02] that she could to be who she's supposed
[1:31:04] to be that makes sense
[1:31:07] starts at the top
[1:31:11] unselfishly
[1:31:16] Paul says so ought men to love their
[1:31:17] wives as their own bodies now he's
[1:31:19] getting down where the rubber meets the
[1:31:21] road
[1:31:22] he that loveth his wife loveth himself
[1:31:24] you think by taking well I'm going to
[1:31:27] take some me time and do things for me
[1:31:28] and and think about me listen there is
[1:31:30] no me once you're married
[1:31:34] there's no me there's no I'm going to
[1:31:36] keep my account she's gonna keep hers
[1:31:38] and she'll make her money I'll make mine
[1:31:39] that's a modern concept of marriage
[1:31:41] that's not what God
[1:31:43] put in place
[1:31:45] there's no me there's us
[1:31:50] men ought to love their wives as their
[1:31:52] own bodies because if you love your wife
[1:31:54] you love yourself
[1:31:56] why would you not love your wife when
[1:31:58] you know when you don't show love to her
[1:32:00] and you don't do what you're supposed to
[1:32:01] do it's going to come back at you
[1:32:05] right you're going to pay for that
[1:32:08] you get what you put in
[1:32:11] right and and realize we are initiators
[1:32:14] as men women are responders in many ways
[1:32:16] and it's not just in uh just in uh
[1:32:19] fleshly ways but actually in actually in
[1:32:21] life just in life we are we are
[1:32:23] initiators and and we're to go and watch
[1:32:26] for those things and and we can't do it
[1:32:28] unless we're around them but if we're
[1:32:30] around them we're the one that puts in
[1:32:31] when you put in when you when you
[1:32:33] initiate those things when you
[1:32:35] voluntarily do things you wouldn't have
[1:32:36] to do that causes your wife to
[1:32:38] reciprocate and she ends up actually
[1:32:41] maybe doing over and above what she
[1:32:43] would it makes your life better if you
[1:32:44] love your wife you love yourself not
[1:32:46] only that but you're also one flesh
[1:32:49] for no man ever yet hated his own flesh
[1:32:51] but nourisheth and cherisheth it even as
[1:32:54] the Lord the church
[1:32:55] for we are members of his body of his
[1:32:57] flesh and of his bones for this caused
[1:32:59] shall a man leave his father and mother
[1:33:00] and shall be joined unto his wife and
[1:33:02] they too shall be one flesh
[1:33:05] the word nourishes this nourisheth it up
[1:33:07] are you still with me
[1:33:09] did I say I was closing I am closing now
[1:33:15] another hour right
[1:33:17] no we're not going to do that we're
[1:33:19] almost done
[1:33:20] he nourishes it
[1:33:23] nourishes refers to food and internal
[1:33:25] sustenance cherisheth to clothing and
[1:33:27] external fostering but it's natural and
[1:33:29] spiritual obviously nourish and cherish
[1:33:33] and the idea is this you don't dress
[1:33:35] yourself or feed yourself any old way
[1:33:39] right if your wife well maybe some of
[1:33:41] you do but
[1:33:43] if your wife picked picked out the worst
[1:33:45] clothes you have that you hate
[1:33:47] one morning picks that out and that's
[1:33:50] what you're going to wear maybe she
[1:33:51] don't pick out your clothes but or maybe
[1:33:52] she buys them I don't know maybe she
[1:33:53] irons them people do that anymore but
[1:33:55] whatever she does Andrew Glover does but
[1:33:59] we know he earns his clothes and and uh
[1:34:02] so uh but anyway that threw me off track
[1:34:05] but whatever she does if she gave you if
[1:34:08] you got the worst set of clothes that
[1:34:10] you had
[1:34:11] and you were wearing them clothes around
[1:34:12] they weren't ironed they were messed up
[1:34:13] and then you get home and the dinner's
[1:34:15] on the table and and it's the worst meal
[1:34:18] the one you've told her I don't like
[1:34:20] if you were brave enough
[1:34:25] and it's just the worst possible thing
[1:34:27] you would be so upset because she
[1:34:30] deliberately did something that she knew
[1:34:32] you wouldn't like and I know most of you
[1:34:33] ladies would never do that
[1:34:35] unless you were just particularly upset
[1:34:39] huh
[1:34:41] but you wouldn't do that
[1:34:44] truthfully the man wouldn't do
[1:34:47] that right I'm not gonna go eat the
[1:34:49] worst thing on purpose
[1:34:51] so if I won't dress myself any old way I
[1:34:54] don't want my wife dressed in any old
[1:34:55] way
[1:34:56] I want to take care of her
[1:34:58] if I won't feed myself any old thing I
[1:35:01] don't want my wife eating any old thing
[1:35:04] I want to take care of her
[1:35:06] now think about this now
[1:35:08] as it comes to Christ in the church
[1:35:10] Christ makes no decisions which do not
[1:35:14] build up his church
[1:35:16] have you thought about that he makes no
[1:35:18] decisions
[1:35:19] except for those that build up the
[1:35:21] church edify the church
[1:35:24] oh my
[1:35:25] God oh my listen that's the way we ought
[1:35:27] to be as husbands that's agape love for
[1:35:29] our wives is when we make no decisions
[1:35:32] which do not build up our families
[1:35:34] see he doesn't eat steak while his wife
[1:35:37] eats those sausages from a can
[1:35:40] huh
[1:35:42] oh I can't stand those
[1:35:46] but he doesn't eat steak while she eats
[1:35:48] spam
[1:35:50] they're one
[1:35:51] are you with me now
[1:35:53] he doesn't give her the leftovers
[1:35:56] but she's one with him
[1:35:58] and that's the way we are with Christ
[1:35:59] listen listen what he did for us John 14
[1:36:02] 1 let not your heart be troubled you
[1:36:04] believe in God believe also in me in my
[1:36:06] father's house for many mansions if it
[1:36:08] were not so I would have told you I go
[1:36:10] to prepare a place for you
[1:36:13] and if I go and prepare a place for you
[1:36:15] I will come again and receive you unto
[1:36:17] myself and where I am there you may be
[1:36:19] also
[1:36:20] now watch brother Brandon said look them
[1:36:22] hands designed this speaking of our
[1:36:25] future home
[1:36:26] for his beloved bride
[1:36:28] them hands them nail scarred hands
[1:36:32] oh that ought to make us run all around
[1:36:33] the building and Shout
[1:36:35] them hands
[1:36:37] the same ones were nailed to a tree he
[1:36:40] went he went to glory and he and went
[1:36:42] into that other dimension and began to
[1:36:44] design a home
[1:36:46] for us
[1:36:49] yeah them hands designed this for his
[1:36:51] beloved bride designs in Tender Love
[1:36:55] for his bride yes
[1:36:57] them hands designed a home
[1:37:01] that's the place of the husband now
[1:37:02] watch
[1:37:04] truly prepares a home for your pleasure
[1:37:06] to make you happy
[1:37:08] in First Peter 3 and 7 Peter puts it
[1:37:11] this way he's much more blunt than Paul
[1:37:13] and much more on a a local level he says
[1:37:17] husbands
[1:37:19] don't be stupid
[1:37:21] with your wives
[1:37:24] huh you know what that's what that says
[1:37:27] dwell with them according to knowledge
[1:37:29] husbands don't be stupid when it comes
[1:37:32] to your wife
[1:37:33] give honor unto her
[1:37:36] as until the weaker vessel and as being
[1:37:39] heirs together of the grace of life that
[1:37:42] your prayers be not hindered
[1:37:44] I want to give you an example of that
[1:37:45] before we close
[1:37:48] brother Branham wanted to go west he was
[1:37:50] called To Go West there was something in
[1:37:51] his heart he always wanted to go west
[1:37:53] it was just something that about it he
[1:37:55] God was calling him to that
[1:37:58] when they built his home he didn't want
[1:38:00] it to be built I'll just read it to you
[1:38:01] but Brennan said I he said just before
[1:38:03] we built this house up here the
[1:38:05] parsonage where it is now he said I did
[1:38:07] not want to build there
[1:38:09] he said my wife's mother was old
[1:38:11] and and she even wept about it she said
[1:38:14] I just can't leave Mom here with knowing
[1:38:17] she's old and she might not be taken
[1:38:18] care of
[1:38:20] now remember brother Brown's mom had
[1:38:21] already passed away I believe at that
[1:38:23] time or she was very old and passed away
[1:38:25] first and then his wife's mother was
[1:38:27] still living
[1:38:29] and so she said I just can't leave Mom
[1:38:31] here without knowing she's old and she
[1:38:32] might not be taken care of he said well
[1:38:34] I understood that I understand
[1:38:36] that's her mother the only mother she
[1:38:39] ever had or ever will have
[1:38:40] so I understood that so I prayed to the
[1:38:43] Lord
[1:38:45] oh my look at the humility of how he how
[1:38:48] he talked to God about it I said Lord
[1:38:51] being that I do not like the place
[1:38:56] no
[1:38:59] he built the house that he wanted to
[1:39:00] live in in Tucson never lived in it
[1:39:05] he made the right decision with his wife
[1:39:09] I prayed to the Lord I said Lord being
[1:39:10] that I do not like the place
[1:39:12] I said make me satisfied
[1:39:16] I'll go anywhere you want me to go from
[1:39:18] anywhere but I don't want to grieve my
[1:39:20] wife so he felt a call from God to go
[1:39:23] west
[1:39:25] but he said I don't want to grieve my
[1:39:27] wife to take her away from here into a
[1:39:29] strange country where she knows no one
[1:39:31] and then I'm gone all the time anyhow
[1:39:34] just make me satisfied
[1:39:38] to be here with her
[1:39:40] that's God's love manifesting through a
[1:39:43] man
[1:39:46] just made me happy to be here with her
[1:39:49] oh God
[1:39:51] I want us to Bow our heads together Paul
[1:39:53] says in verse 32 this is a great mystery
[1:39:57] but I speak concerning Christ
[1:40:00] and the church
[1:40:03] and this is the quietness of this moment
[1:40:05] I want us to think about it
[1:40:08] if you're a husband today you have a
[1:40:10] wife
[1:40:13] I don't know what the relationship's
[1:40:14] like it may be hard you may have gone
[1:40:17] through some things all of us have on
[1:40:19] some level or another some more than
[1:40:20] others
[1:40:26] it's just something come in my heart
[1:40:27] when I read this I said God
[1:40:30] I don't want to agree with my wife
[1:40:35] make me satisfied
[1:40:38] I don't have any calling to go west or
[1:40:40] to move anywhere that's not it
[1:40:42] but just when when there's something I
[1:40:45] want to do but I know it would break the
[1:40:47] heart of my wife
[1:40:49] satisfied Lord
[1:40:53] make me satisfied
[1:40:55] I wanted to go to Israel this year
[1:40:58] my wife didn't want to be gone from the
[1:40:59] kids for that long it's gonna be a long
[1:41:01] trip
[1:41:03] had opportunity to go
[1:41:07] and I'm not putting myself up because I
[1:41:09] had I had to really fight a battle with
[1:41:11] myself over this my wife didn't want to
[1:41:14] go she's never flown overseas and and
[1:41:16] never flown at all and and being gone
[1:41:19] from the kids that long that's her world
[1:41:21] they may be getting older but they're
[1:41:23] still her babies and I don't mean to
[1:41:25] sorry Brittany I don't mean to point you
[1:41:27] out this morning but
[1:41:28] she didn't want to go
[1:41:29] I had to come to terms with that she
[1:41:31] didn't tell me no she wouldn't do that
[1:41:34] but I had to pray kind of like this Lord
[1:41:36] make me satisfied
[1:41:39] made me satisfied to be here with her he
[1:41:42] said well so they should do that no you
[1:41:44] should you should come together you
[1:41:46] should make decisions together you as a
[1:41:49] husband should lead your wife in such a
[1:41:52] way that she would be happy to live in
[1:41:54] your home
[1:41:56] and I found that it doesn't really
[1:41:58] matter how much money there is it
[1:41:59] doesn't really matter what's what's
[1:42:01] around like that what matters
[1:42:03] is whether or not
[1:42:05] there's something in your life
[1:42:07] that she can respect and reverence and
[1:42:09] say that's a man of God he makes
[1:42:10] mistakes but he's a man of God
[1:42:14] and I know he wants what's best for me
[1:42:17] don't you want what's best for your
[1:42:18] wives for your children for your home
[1:42:20] that God make me like that I I want to
