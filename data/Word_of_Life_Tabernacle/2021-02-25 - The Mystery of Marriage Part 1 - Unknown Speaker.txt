meant the world to us and so we thank you for that and you didn't have to do that but we thank you for it and and uh we know that god will bless you for that uh brother josh swims will be with us on sunday morning remember that march 7th there will be communion service with two services that day at 10 30 and 3 so i'll catch up a little bit on my preaching that weekend so remember that as well genesis chapter 2 and verse 8 we'll also have a dinner in between the service on march 7th genesis chapter 2 and verse 8 and the lord god planted a garden eastward in eden and there he put the man whom he had formed out of the ground made the lord god to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food and the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of good and evil and the river went out of eden to water the garden from thence it was parted and became into four heads the name of the first is paisan that is it which compasses the whole land of favala where there is gold the gold of that land is good there's bedellium in the onyx stone and the name of the second river is gaijon the same as it that compasses the whole land of ethiopia the name of the third river is hedekal that is it which goes toward the east of assyria the fourth river is euphrates and the lord god took the man and put him into the garden of eden to dress it and to keep it and the lord god commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shall not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die and the lord god said it is not good that the man should be alone i will make him and help meet for him and out of the ground the lord god formed every beast to the field and every fowl of the air brought them unto adam to see what he would call them and whatsoever adam called every living creature that was the name thereof adam gave names to all cattle to the fowl of the air to every beast of the field but for adam there was not found a help meet for him the lord god caused a deep sleep to fall upon adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs closed up the flesh instead thereof in the rib once the lord god had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man and adam said this is now bone of my bones and the flesh of my flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleveland to his wife there shall be one flesh and they were both naked the man and his wife they were not ashamed i'll let you be seated there god bless you as you're seated kind of a long text for me but i want to read from ephesians 5 31 and 32 as well it repeats this it says for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife and they too shall be one flesh he says this is a great mystery but i speak concerning christ and the church it's good to see each one of you here tonight good to have alan's with us tonight and and i see a a man here at the back thank you for for visiting with us tonight pray the lord would bless you there's something about natural beauty and romance that go together and i know immediately some of you are going to wonder where i'm going tonight but i want us to think deeply about this and spiritually but i want to talk to you about the mystery of marriage and what marriage looked like in paradise because paul said is a great mystery but he said i speak concerning christ in the church and there's something about paradise and romance that go together you know when you go on a trip for a honeymoon or a vacation you don't look for the ugliest spot you can find at least most of us don't you look for the most beautiful spot that you can find right you you don't look for the the dump down there somewhere and and it's all just any any place of work but you want a beautiful spot because there's something about that you want to find a paradise that you can go to and yeah all of those places have their problems a paradise can be imperfect and it really depends on who's there with you right it's more about the person than it is about the place yet it doesn't hurt to have a nice place right now but it's a paradise because love is there i remember if you'll forgive me for just a moment of going back a few years it's not been that many years but when we got married my wife and i my co-workers where i worked there in alton missouri decided they were going to go together and and help us pay for our honeymoon and so they scheduled a place and one of my co-workers had went to a place 30 years before on her honeymoon and she said well if it's good enough for us it'd be good enough for them and she remembered that being a paradise when we went there to i believe it was called the fox fire resort in branson we went there and for three or four days and it wasn't much of a paradise the carpet was old and the furnishings were outdated and they probably hadn't changed anything in that 30 years but my wife here not long ago we were there in that area and she said she'd like to go back there again well it doesn't have anything to do with the place that it was it was just that we had love there and when love is there it's paradise you might think that about your home i think about the story brother branham told about the black man that was a slave and he'd been released from slavery to go preach the gospel and he goes out and preaches all of his life and then at the end of his life his brethren come in around him and and they said brother sam says here at the end you're nearing the end so pretty soon you're going to get your robin crown he said don't tell me about no robin crown and he said this he said i just want to look at him for a thousand years just want to look at him don't tell me about paradise let me look at him for a thousand years oh that's the way i feel about him tonight is that how you feel i just want to look at him i i just want to be in his presence if i can just be in his presence it's all that matters the first eden was a paradise god didn't put his his children just anywhere he put him in a beautiful place in fact the word eden means pleasure verse 8 says the lord god planted a garden eastward in eden and there he put the man on whom he had formed that means pleasure it's a beautiful place their purpose was not pleasure but god put them in a place of pleasure a place where they could they would be happy there and there is happiness in family life but their purpose was to be god's family on the earth now uh in the greek translation of the new testament it says it this way it says god planted a paradise in eden so it says he put a garden in eden that word garden is paradise he put a garden in eden and that word paradise then was introduced in the new testament is generally used to signify a place of exquisite pleasure and delight the word also means an enclosed garden so it's not just a garden but it's a garden with walls a garden that is meant to be all by itself and off to itself and they were meant to stay there not to go outside the boundaries of it it had specific boundaries and as long as they stayed within those boundaries life was beautiful and you can see a correlation to marriage there but adam was unhappy when he first was in paradise because nothing had been created to correspond with him nothing had been created to complement him and who he was and the lord god said in verse 18 that it's not good that the man should be alone remember he had said it's good it's good it's good and he says it's not good right he looked at everything he made he said it's good but it's not good the condition that man is in he said i will make him a help meet for him in the amplified version it says now the lord god said that it's not beneficial for the man to be alone i will make him a helper one who balances him a counterpart who is suitable and complementary for him brother branham put it like this and i just kind of want to draw our minds to some of the things that brother branham said about this place where they had the first marriage and he put it like this he said as he walked through the garden of eden first as a theophany like the holy spirit he says is in here now walking in here and so adam walked like that at first he said it led the animal life it controlled everything but it couldn't till the soil so god put him in flesh so he could till the soil to take care of the garden he said give him his five senses to till the soil fix up the vineyards and so forth and then the man still looked lonesome he said oh this is a beautiful picture he said look for when he was first made he was made two people together he was made both male and female the man was the bible said he was god made men both male and female created he him and he said notice now when man was separated from the theophany and put in flesh now watch this because it's kind of tricky he said he wasn't just all together there part of his being was still a theophany so it didn't look right now that takes some thinking through but just think about it for a moment adam had been expressed but there was a part of that theophany that had not been expressed right and that part was eve so he couldn't stay alone she had to be expressed but it couldn't be something different from him are you with me now don't you see why jesus had to die on a cross had to be buried had to raise again because he couldn't remain like that it was a part of that that had not been expressed and so here there was a part of that theophany that had not been expressed and so he said it didn't look right he said and and there went the male and female in the cow there went the horse there went the ox there when everything else pairs but adam something he said was lacking the very crave showed that there was a mate waiting for him and what's amazing about this is because many times we look at what brother branham said about the woman i'm going to try to stay behind here tonight and just talk to you but it's hard but when we look at what brother branham said about the woman we look at her and i'll read a quote about that but the random calls are a byproduct of the man and many times we look at that as saying well she's just a byproduct as if that's a bad thing but it just means she come from him right and and so it's not the she's not just the byproduct of the man but it's a part of him and and we look at that and think but there was something there the craze that he had showed that there was a mate waiting for him there had to be something that would be expressed more than there already was it had to happen and the fact is that when we get beyond the millennium when we go into eternity back into eternity we don't go back into christ he keeps us separate does that make sense god's perfect idea of a family was a man and a woman each expressing their individual characteristic that's why it's so terrible what man is doing today because they're they're mixing the two and and causing it to be a uh just it doesn't matter you can be whatever you want to be no you are what god made you and he made you that for a reason to express something out of himself and so there was a crave inside of him he wasn't he didn't need to be alone he wasn't right being alone there had to be a further expression of who he was but the brahmana says you get it he said in the very thoughts we have that we have to die here he said that we're troubled and perplexed we long for a life that has no death it shows it's waiting for us what's waiting for us heaven is waiting for us the very fact that we that we long for heaven shows us there's a heaven there he said adam was lonesome and odd to show that they could not be separated he said no i'm going to go get back to the same thing just a second he said look he never went and got dirt and made it eve amen but he made from the original dirt hallelujah so you can't have anything outside of the word right it always has to come from the original the bride can't be something different from the groom right it can't be something different it's got to come from the original because he couldn't go get other dirt he went and got the original dirt a man annie adam and he took a rib from his side made him a help mate and that was eve she was made for the man and part of the man pretty bad just think about that actually now what she was part of him in the beginning in the creation in a theophany she was part of him it isn't as if god you know we look at it as if god messed up by just making adam and said wait a minute i better make you eve to go along with him that wasn't it at all it was always the plan but it couldn't be from a different creation it had to come from that creation amen and she was part of him in the beginning in the creation of theophany she was part of him down here in this creation she could not be divided in another creation she had to be made in the same creation right does that make sense and that kind of when we talk about a help mate when we talk about somebody as if well she's just a byproduct no she's part of him she was part of him amen and so he says she was part of him down here in this creation she could not be divided in another creation he said that's exactly why christ and god now watch this christ and god had to be the very same person could not be anything different couldn't be two people it come from the same theory if we could put it that way right you can't make christ and god two different lineage of two different people god had to have a family and in order to have that family it had to be all him so he created adam and then he created eve out of adam it couldn't be adam and the knee from somewhere else and that's why adam couldn't go marry somebody else number one there was nobody else right one very many other options in eden right huh but he couldn't have put her away and and divorced her and married another why because she was part of him no matter what she did he had to go out with her she was part of him very bad hallelujah but it shows that there has to be a bride that won't fall because we don't fall and then he comes out after us no he comes after us and then we come into him we're going the right direction does that make sense there's got to be an end time bride that won't fall that will be a part of him flesh of his flesh bone of his bone power of his power and that's why he said christ and god had to be the very same person could not be anything different if he had been a good man or a prophet he wouldn't have been a redeemer he had to be the creator himself he said but he's still at theophany now you see and he said the way he was then now look at the paradise they had everything there was good and pleasant everything well we could dwell on that for a while because like i said no matter how good you have it if you go to the caribbean or caribbean or however you say it if you go down there you're going to find a place that's imperfect less than perfect right and people send back pictures of the beautiful sand and the sea and you don't see the thumbs behind them right and it's just like around here you know i can see it make some beautiful pictures of the river and you don't see the trash up on the bank and it's not everywhere but there's always a downside they lived in a place with no downside they didn't lived in a place that was all good and this is why when it comes to marriage you can't blame your surroundings for what's going on in a marriage because if the surroundings were perfect that marriage should have lasted forever but it didn't the first marriage was also the first broken marriage but i want to talk about this god put them in a paradise for a reason and everything was good but there was an opportunity there even in that paradise for evil because there was a tree of knowledge of good and evil now brother branham says this he said now i want you to notice as we're moving on the holy spirit after brooding into man man came up he said what a beautiful thing he was you wouldn't say that about many men today but he said what a beautiful thing he was god thought so god said it was good he said and then god made the woman he said no she was not in the original creation she's a byproduct of a man he said i want to get started on that but she is a byproduct of man then when she come into existence and she was the prettiest woman in all the world little eve that's saying a lot of course there was only one but she was the prettiest woman in all the world i tell my wife you're the prettiest wife i've ever had prettiest woman in all the world i believe he said i could see her long hair hanging down he said let's say for sake right now it was blonde he said she had her eyes as blue as the sky and her sparkle was like the stars what a sweetheart adam had he said not vulgarity not even in the picture she walked with adam and they come to where the waters was and she'd say oh adam that wind said peace and the wind ceased well it must have made him feel like a man you know peace a little bit harder for us isn't it you walk in your house you need to try that next time you come home and there's winds and waves you know what i'm talking about and you say peace the wind ceased and then she went through and went on through in the great line let out a roar eve could not be afraid there's nothing in here to make her afraid i love that where does fear come from from the outside there's no fear in love amen perfect love cast out fear now he said there's nothing in her to make her afraid she said dear what is that he called the lion over and said come here he patted him on the head and he meowed like a kitten what behind him is a little dog would follow you from your house here comes sheet of the tiger he talked to the cheetah he began to speak with her she followed along but you know it began to get evening time the sun was setting he said sweetheart we must go up to the cathedral you say well when did this church thing start why do we why do we have church from the very beginning they went up to the cathedral he said we've got to worship it wasn't a denomination it was in a great big forest and they went up and knelt down as the sun was going down and the father came down amen i believe he still does that today the lightnings flashed the thunders roared and a beautiful majestic light sailed over the bushes and it come down can you hear the loving voice of the father say children have you enjoyed yourself today papa has come down to kiss you good night lay you down for the night a kiss upon the cheek of adam and a kiss upon the cheek of eve was such a beautiful thing they didn't have to be forgiven they'd never done anything wrong they didn't have any to wrestle with any thoughts or anything that had happened in the past i know that keeps a lot of people from worship you imagine what kind of worship this was they didn't have to deal with any of that amen we've got something even greater than that because we've been redeemed but he said father he said they went to he said he lays his big arm out and she lays her head little danny head upon his arm as a pillow he went to sleep and perfect nothing can bother them fathers watching over them there's nothing in the earth to harm them leo the lion lays there sheet of the tiger lays there he laid them all down father he said if that isn't wonderful and then sin came in and spoiled the picture he said but we were here god's purpose has to be carried out you see marriage was designed to be paradise eden perfect marriage can be a wonderful place it's not meant to be a place of controversy not a bondage we hear a lot of jokes about that and and we i probably contributed to that a little bit myself sometimes we i think we talk even jokingly too negatively about marriage because our kids hear us and i think why would i ever want to be married but the truth is marriage can be good and i've wanted so many times for people that are unmarried and younger people coming up to have what i have as hard as it is sometimes i want them to have what i have i want them to be able to experience that i want them to be able to know what it's like to love somebody through thick and thin through everything that goes on and to have a moment of paradise with that person even when you don't have anything even when there's nothing else going right you still have your place of a perfection your place of paradise with that person now think of that spiritually as well when everything else goes wrong you still have jesus amen and he said i'll be a father to the fatherless amen amen now within the boundaries of eden of this marriage that god has has given us are the greatest pleasures of life if those boundaries are crossed the greatest evil in life marriage is paradise when love rules and we don't have to say what it is when there's hate brother brown says how sweet it must have been to have seen adam and eve in that love affair walking through the garden before there was any kind of carnal relationship there was love you know and love makes the paradise last right because the the body's going to break down we're not in perfect bodies like they were it's going to break down it's going to fall apart we're going to get fat well some of you all won't but i did but stuart you must have been meant to hear this i know allison didn't need it so but you know we're going to get to where it's hard on the physical side to have that same level of attraction but if there's love there it'll make the paradise last because that's what it was based on in the beginning right and and we shouldn't look back and constantly look back down our life and say well if we could only have what we used to have no you got better love now than you did back then you just don't remember right if you're really in love with one another your love is greater now than what it was then i wouldn't want to be dating or engaged again i don't want to be courting again i i've got the real thing right and i think those of us who we we should recognize that we have something that's great and something that that can be a pleasure to us and and i think we ought to recognize that about god as well this isn't just us coming to church because we have to it's not because oh i'll do the dishes today because i know he'd get mad if i didn't do them oh i'll go to work today because i know she'd get mad if i didn't make any money no it's not that it's because you love her you love him amen and why do you serve god why do you come the house of god not because i made you do it god help us if we get to that place where it's because you're afraid i'll preach at you why do you serve god because god himself you're so in love with him i wouldn't want to not be around god's people because i know that god is there and i love him so much amen because i love him it makes me love you makes you love me many people brother branham tells us to ride a light road looking through a rear view mirror he said especially he said many of our women they're always when past about 30 years old they want to go back and be a young girl again he said and get 50 they still want the same thing not only that but the men too anybody who looks through a rear view mirror is going to wreck up somewhere you can't drive the road looking through the rear view mirror you got to let go of your mistakes at some point you've got to forgive yourself and forgive everybody else too and i've dealt with this i've seen that just destroy people where they can't get over how they were raised they can't get over how they come up they can't get over a certain pastor or a certain preacher a certain thing and it just eats at them and eats at them and eventually they leave church all together they completely take themselves away from god and you think why why would they do that it's not because they're not good people but they just couldn't get to that point where they could say i forgive you many people who mess up and you know that's all of us all of us mess up at some point or another but when you mess up you got to get back up brother brown said this he said i'd rather be on the battlefield making mistakes than to be criticizing someone else who's trying to win souls for christ at least if i'm making mistakes i got an eraser on my pencil at least it's there for a reason it's because i'm working right and so that ought to be the way we are in marriage as well and so he said you can't drive the road looking through the rear view mirror he said but i believe what paul said forgetting those things which are in the past i pressed toward the mark of the high calling in christ good and bad and indifferent i'm laying those are the past is passed the poet says this way he said today is the only living time all of the rest are either unborn or already dead this moment is the only living time so now brother branham says this way he said see don't look what you were look what you're going to be amen don't look what you were look what you're going to be i'm going to be in a new body i'm going to live for god i'm going to stand for truth i'm going to be a believer and i'm leaving here one of these days don't look at what you were look what you're going to be if something happens to you traumatic maybe in your body you get sick and you just can't seem to get over it but don't look at what you were what happened to you look what you're going to be one day i'm not going to be relying on a cane anymore one day i'm not going to i'm not going to be bound to this wheelchair one day i'm not going to be bound to these things i'm going to run again i'm going to walk again i'm going to be a young man or a young woman again look at what you were look what you're going to be brother random said i was remarrying an old couple one time they'd taken their vows over he said they were 83 and 84 years old apiece he said i'd give them the full vow he said i felt crazy he said just a young fellow as i was he said the old man had been married about 60 years him and his wife they were taking the vow and they were just as much in love as they ever was in in life i want that if the lord tarries i want to be married to my wife for 60 years that's a goal of mine to be able to do that my hat's off to those of you who've done that that's a goal of mine but you know what i want more the second thing to be true be just as much in love as i ever was he said he had a long beard and i said to him i said to her i said what do you think about it and i asked him first i said what do you think about it why do you wear a long beard he said i think an old man my age should have a long beard so some of y'all if you have a long beard and you're old you have a message for it now i don't know where that leads brother caleb but i said to her what do you think about it she said well she said anything john does is just fine don't you want to be like that i love my grandma and grandpa on my dad's side they're both passed on now but they had a relationship where they were just always yelling at each other from the other room and he'd taken his his hearing aids out and turned up the tv where he couldn't hear and on purpose you know i don't want that kind of relationship it's funny looking back at it but i don't want to be like that i want to be just as much in love as i ever was and so i said well there's quite a difference quite a difference in you since you married her he said you know the lord has been good said she's just as pretty as she ever was but you know as she gets older my sight gets dimmer god made it that way you wouldn't want nothing else amen he said i thought that was really sweet he said i hope my wife thinks the same thing and i feel we all feel that way about it he said but they had found life they'd found how to live it that's the way to live it stay right in eden all right don't cross out of it it'll just bring you trouble stay right within the boundaries of that paradise that you found if you found it stay there don't leave it if you haven't found it there's a place to find it and it's not in some other person or some other thing it's in christ because if you find it in him you'll find it in in life as well now see this eden was subject though to their ability to make choices every day maybe they they had everything they could ever want but just making a choice to eat of the tree and we all know what that was of knowledge of good and evil would cause them to be taken out of the garden one choice so the evil was present in the garden now it's a choice that you make you make a choice to stay married every day because you're put on free moral agency you could conceivably although some of you may have a hard time getting down to the court by yourself but every one of us could conceivably file for divorce we could why don't you why don't you i understand things happen and life gets so mixed up because we live in this imperfect world but why don't you why don't you because you make a choice not to and so you choose not to do the things that are going to take you out of eden i know if i do that i'm going to be taken out of my paradise and because satan is in the business of dissatisfaction what he wants to do is make you dissatisfied with your current condition right that's what he does that's what he started doing he's an expert at it he comes into a perfect world and he comes in there and somehow makes eve feel like some of these teenagers feel today living in america well ain't got nothing huh these people burning down buildings and everything like that why do they do that because they feel like they don't have anything they've been made to feel like that they're the poorest most wretched people on the earth you think how can you feel that way you're looting even your looting shows you're not getting food you've already got food what are they looting big screen tvs why do they do that because they already have everything they could ever want and i don't say that lightly i know some people are poorer than others i've been poorer than most so i know what that's like but i know this in this country we have far more than any other generation in history has ever had if you live now in this country you're a blessed person but satan is in the business of making you dissatisfied that's his job that's what he wants to do and so he comes into eden and he begins to talk to eve and he says but you you aren't what you could be and you don't know what you could know and you haven't experienced what you could experience and so slowly he talks her into this state of being dissatisfied and then he offers her a solution you see the apostle paul says i've learned in whatever state i am there with to be content godliness with contentment is great gain there's something to be said about just being happy with who you have and where you are and where you live but you gotta you gotta work at that because the just the human condition is to respond listen she was hadn't even gone through the fall yet she wasn't dealing with a fallen nature and she still was dissatisfied why the devil worked in her mind to make her that way and that's the same thing the enemy does today and he does it through facebook he does it through the internet he does it through somebody you meet he does it in some other way where he tries to make you dissatisfied don't you realize he's doing that in the spiritual realm as well trying to make you dissatisfied with the message of the hour how could i be dissatisfied with what brings me life how can i be dissatisfied with the thing that's brought me here i don't have nothing else to preach you've been around me long enough now you've heard me preaching nothing i've got nothing else to preach with this message where would i be without this message i don't have anything else but satan will move in and try to make the people dissatisfied with a supernatural god look what he did to them when they come over from egypt and and they were eating manna and pretty soon they were so sick of it that they said there's nothing at all to eat but man they hated it they said our soul loves this light bread why it's satan's job to make people dissatisfied you do the same thing in church you're talking working all the time constantly trying to get you to be dissatisfied but you know where you should worship god you should worship god in the place where you are if it's in the car if it's at the church wherever it is you should worship god you say well you you do the very best you can god will open up better opportunities you know how to get a better job be the best employee you can be right my pastor always told me that and i always kind of graded at that but it's the truth you want to but i have you always told us this he said make your boss rich your job should be to make your boss rich i got to think about that what in the world does that mean well it means that you do your very best whether the boss is worthy of it or not right and in the end it'll make you so much better at what you do and what and people will notice that and you'll get promoted to something better plus god will honor it don't be dissatisfied sit there and gripe all the time you know the people who never go anywhere i found that out as a young man my dad excused me for digressing a little bit but my dad was an insurance salesman we'd go to the sales meetings with him and there were certain people there who always griped they were always agents who didn't sell anything every week they'd come and they'd gripe about the leads they got they'd grab out the thing and what my dad's boss would do is he would take those same leads that had already been run give them to my dad and he'd make thousands of dollars the next week off the same leads because people were just dissatisfied and they never could make any money because they were dissatisfied with what they have god help us not to be that way we've got to find life and how to live it to be content with what we have you realize satan even tried that on jesus tried to make him dissatisfied with the plan that god had for his life and he showed him all the kingdoms of the world that's what satan does he uses visual means to try to show you all the things that you could have if you would just follow him say god help us today that we would stay right with the word like jesus did amen he stayed right with the word and he defeated the devil not with his supernatural power but just with the word of god and it was satan trying to make him dissatisfied by showing him what was his i don't need what you got huh if there are things i could do to have the church full of people there's things we could do to do that we could let down some bars but i don't need those people i don't need that money are you with me today i need christ i need the word amen you need the same thing oh sure you could make more money you could do something different but you want to have christ so you give up egypt to take christ brother branham says this he said excuse this expression i told my wife here they're not long ago she both he said both getting old and i said to her i said do you love me like you used to there's a good question she said i certainly do i said you know i love you so much so i would like to take you and pull you inside of me so we could just be really be one he said i just love you that much and it's kind of a crude way of putting it but random says that multiple times in the message he said now that multiply that by a hundred million you'll find out how that the believer who falls in love with christ wants to get into him because it's a love and here he's going to show us how through these promises he said we might be partakers of christ's divine nature these mortal bodies how that we can be partakers he said i might say something here he said the reason i believe now someone got me all wrong here not long ago i got a letter from the ministerial association that said i believe that we were soul mated and we must leave our command companions if we're not soul mated to them to marry another one we were soul mated to he said oh my he said i'm not guilty of a heresy like that he said i've always been against that i don't believe in that certainly not i believe i i believe that god gives us a mate that's true he said and then we become part of each other again i've told you before you say well who's my my mate my eternal mate in heaven the person you're married to why would you believe anything else someone asked me do you believe so-and-so and your family went to heaven why would i believe they went to hell what good does that do me i've got to lean on the mercy of god and the grace of god recognized i'm not the judge right and so why would i believe that i should be married to somebody else i know that's not right and just even if i had no love or no affection or anything i could say well i'll start there and move up from there god put me with them for a reason now and i'm thank god we have love in our marriage because the truth is i can try to talk you into staying married if you don't have love you won't now brother branham says before man gets married he said he should think these things over and study it he said a young man asked me the other day he said you think i ought to get married brother branham was such and such a girl i said how much do you think of her he said oh my i just love her. you know i don't think the young man was standing there saying well i love her i think he had some passion to it and the prophet of god could see that oh i just love her he said well if you're not going to live without her you better marry her then isn't that the way we could be about christ oh i just love him now there's something deeper to it it goes into our emotions it's not all about emotions but there's something about a man that loves god it does something to you does something to your heart he said but if you can live without it you better not but if it's going to kill you you better go ahead and get married and what i was trying to get to him is this that if you love her so much he said now right now before you're married everything is just fine and dandy after you get married then the toils and trials of life come in that's when you've got to be so in love that you understand one another when you when you're disappointed in her she's disappointed in you you still understand one another that's the way it is with christ see we've got to be so in love with him that when we ask for something and he doesn't give it to us that doesn't shake us a bit there's there's been things my wife's asking me for i couldn't get for i wanted to but i couldn't do it either mostly because i didn't have the money but sometimes because i just knew it wouldn't be good and there's things i've asked her for that she knew wouldn't be good that's just the truth i'm just being honest with you sometimes we've got to say no but it didn't shake us a bit why there's a reason why and if you love one another you you're a partaker of their nature now brother i think his brother david had talked to me about how that you finish one another's sentences and one one of you all did and maybe brother mark was talking about that as well he finishes his wife's sentences that's good and bad but see you're part of each other's nature you just you just become part of one another you become so one until you couldn't do without that person and that's the way we are with christ he said the only way you can do that is to become partakers of his divine nature then you'll understand the reason he can't give it to you be a partaker of his divine nature i want you to think spiritually now before we close you see god has called us and i believe in our marriages too to come back to that place but speaking spiritually now he's called us back to eden and this is a mistake that people make he said where are we going back to are we going back to 1906 are we going back to 1960 are we going back to are we going back to the early church yes we are but we're going back farther than that right we don't stop there in fact brother branham makes a statement that pentecost represented that again we're not stopping at pentecost we're going back further than that we've got higher potentials than just the return of the gifts we've got higher potentials than even having a good service though that's part of it you got to get there first you got to have the good service before you can have the rest you have to go through that but there's got to be somewhere you're going that's beyond that we're going back to eden again we're going back to paradise again we're going back to a place that we can't even comprehend with the jt right now we can't even comprehend it but we're going back there amen brother banham tells us she said look back you under when adam was leaving with the sweetheart going out under condemnation with a shadow of redemption somewhere because there was blood running over them somewhere there was a shadow he knew it here's something going he said what is it it's the old bloody sheepskin beating up and down on his legs speaking of some time there's a land behind the river that they call the sweet forever and we only reach that shore by faith decree he said knowing that someday they'd get back into eden again you see redemption takes us back to eden hallelujah brother bradley said man is still the same man is always praising god for what he has done they're talking about what he will do and ignoring what he's doing he said that's the nature of man now watch this he said let's look at him what he is doing now what is god doing today he is jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever the same jehovah god that was made manifest in him he said at that day you'll know that i was in the father and the father in me and i and you and you and me god condescending from a pillar of fire to a man and from that man sacrificed life the blood that cleansed us and come down into us to fellowship again what's he doing right now to pull out a church for an eden again amen i couldn't leave this message if i wanted to because i'm the one that god wanted in eden amen there was only one eve he had to go out with her because there was only one hey there's only one bride there's only one bride you could take that down on an individual level there's only one of you he has to have you this end time bride cannot fall why can it not fall because he's going to make sure you don't fall amen i'm so grateful for that tonight i'm so grateful for his mercy because brother branham said if i if it wasn't for election he said i'd be a pretty discouraged man because you see everything going on around you but there's something about you you know you've been called to a higher place a better place he said god condescending from a pillar of fire to a man and now back to eden he said notice then one like the first adam and eve before sin separated them in death now christ the second adam in life redeems his bride from death and now where are we at on his way back to the original eden that's the next step that's where we're going amen hallelujah restoring back his bride in fellowship back with god and husband and wife you realize what he's doing he's bringing us back to that perfect place again what does he have to do before he can bring us back what do you have to do in your marriage before you can have paradise again you've got to restore a broken fellowship very bad how do you do that you can't it won't just happen automatically someone's got to take the first step and you and i couldn't take the first step it was impossible for us brother paul to take the first step he had to take the first step he had to step into the human flesh and come down and live and die for me to restore back his bride and fellowship back with god as husband and wife in the garden of eden christ and his bride amen and god at that day the kingdom shall be given over the father he might be all in all he's just speaking all here david's sitting on the throne the king of the whole human race while they're yet thinking i'll know what they're thinking about what a great place that'll be before they speak i'll answer them the wolf and the lamb shall feed together the lion shall eat straw like a bully they shall feed together and lay down they shall not hurt nor destroy it on my holy mountain right back exactly to eden again as hard as it can go very bad you might think this world is going down fast but let me tell you you're going right back to eden again not on a soak it's so great but you're going back as hard as you can go amen amen just as fast as the rock and roll group was marching down into hell just as fast as they were going down into hell the bride was going up to onward christian soldiers amen amen do you believe that tonight musicians come how are we going to get there i want to go i i want to go back you ever get that way if you ever break fellowship in a marriage i think all of us have at some point or another you want to get back to paradise again how do you get back to eden well you've got to restore fellowship somebody's got to make the first move you've got to be willing to take it all on yourself all the blame all the guilt oh it was my fault that's hard to do sometimes but he took all the sin all the shame all the pain took it all away from me took it on himself i want to go back how am i ever going to get back how you going to get back in your marriage you got to make that move how are you ever going to get back to where you ought to be in christ to that place of perfect communion well i want this so bad in my life i want you said do you have it all the time no but when i do i just feel like the world is right there in front of me all the promises of god are just laying there for me to pick up but then at times it feels like i've done something that separated me what do i do quickly i want to run as hard as i can to get back to eden again back into fellowship where i can look at the promises of god as if they're mine but caleb we talked about that how the gifts operating in things in the church we want that we want god to move we want but we've got to be have that relationship first it's got to be relationship because if not it'll just be a bunch of carnality right but there's got to be a relationship first where you come back into eden again how are we going to get there how did they lose even one word one word she was deceived you said how am i ever going to know but god gave us a perfect word now he did i'm not saying a man was perfect but god gave us a perfect word there is a difference in a man having the power of infallibility in it being an infallible man there's a difference god sent back the power of infallibility that's what the message of the hour is it's not a man it's not about a man it's about christ amen to bring us to restore us back to take us back to eden again amen listen what he says he said now if this all this cost that for just one lady misunderstanding the word she didn't do it willfully she was deceived the bible said deceived he said but he's not saying she was deceived by the word but if all this happened by the word that one word caused all this and you and i are not going back with anything less than the entire word i'm glad god didn't leave that up to me very bad but the book's open there was a mighty angel come down and he opened the book and when he opened the book we had the entire word christ in plain view i don't have to do that christ did that but with that you can take that open book and eat it up and come back into eden again amen there's a way back it's about redemption and restoration he said but you don't know what's happened you don't know what's happened in my marriage you don't know what's happened with my children you don't know what's happened in my life with your heads about and your eyes closed but there is a way back and the way back is through god's word eat it up accept his atonement for your sins for the things let go of the things that have passed press toward the mark of the high calling in christ do you want that tonight oh i want that fellowship so bad i wanted so bad i hate it my wife and i there was a time we could say we'd never fussed but i can't say that today we fussed but it just makes you to want to give back so bad you want to get back in fellowship you want to be able to talk to one another again maybe this wednesday night be just an opportunity get back in fellowship with him again jesus i just want to talk to you for a moment i just want to make sure there's nothing in the way i just want to worship you i just i just want to say it's all me lord i realize it's not you if there's a distance it's me you haven't moved but i've moved every day i do things or i say things i should but yet god i rely on your mercy and it just makes me love you that much more because i know you'll take me back you won't lose me the same time brian can't fall and it gives us such assurance and peace he's not holding it over our head he didn't bring this message to hold it over our head and beat us with it he brought this message as a love letter to his bride i want you to come home i want you to come back heavenly father lord jesus we're talking to you tonight just like we would talk to a friend like we would talk to our husbands spiritually speaking we love you lord jesus you sit patiently waiting all the time the lord and you your providence you give good gifts to us and you bring us things that we don't even deserve we're so grateful for the good things that you've given us lord but today we don't want a rover a crowd we just want to sit and look at you for a while oh god that's what i want in my life every day i want to just have that close to sword where i can sit and look at you [Music] i could just look at your word and it would just it wouldn't just be a dull reading lord it would just be a reality in my life may it be so everyday god maybe so for each one of these people lord the married and the unmarried oh god would you just reach down every home lord may your holy spirit come down within every marriage we know it takes all three to make a marriage work it takes a husband and a wife and it takes you to come down in the cool of the day oh god may it be so may we not lay blame on our surroundings what we're going through but lord may we just come in as close relationship with you as we can when we do that lord we'll know how much more we love each other i pray you grant it lord oh god you've spoken to us such great things in this hour help us not to take it lightly we're going back to eden we're not going just back to a denominational revival we're going back to eden we're going all the way back new bodies lord so grateful for that today so grateful my body fights me all the time even at 35 i can't imagine what it would be like down the road but god i know you're faithful i know you're faithful lord and i know as long as i'm here and as long as these people are here you'll provide a word for us there'll be a spirit that'll meet us here because you love us lord you won't leave us comfortless don't leave us as orphans in this world but you talk to us if we'll just reach out to you today thank you for all that you do worship you lord in jesus name hallelujah how sweet [Music]
