[0:00] you see his presence brings peace
[0:03] in a time of storm
[0:06] peace
[0:08] there's no peace in the world today
[0:11] but john 14 to 27 when he's talking
[0:13] about this comforter he said peace i
[0:14] leave with you my peace i give unto you
[0:17] not as the world giveth give i unto you
[0:19] let not your heart be troubled neither
[0:21] let it be afraid
[0:22] these things i have spoken unto you that
[0:24] in me you might have peace
[0:26] in the world you shall have tribulation
[0:28] but be of good cheer
[0:30] i have overcome
[0:32] the world
[0:34] it's a peace that passes understanding
[0:35] in philippians 4 7 that the peace of god
[0:38] which passed with all understanding
[0:39] shall keep your hearts and minds through
[0:41] christ jesus shall keep in other words
[0:43] it will keep you from going the places
[0:46] where you would have gone in your mind
[0:49] the holy spirit is a comforter that that
[0:52] won't let you go there in the sense of
[0:54] you might
[0:56] you might be so despondent as to give up
[0:59] but the holy spirit doesn't give up
[1:02] you might be so in such despair and such
[1:05] sorrow as to just let it all go and lay
[1:07] it all down but the holy spirit doesn't
[1:09] do
[1:10] that amen aren't you glad that when you
[1:14] get when you're down to your last rope
[1:15] and the last inch of your ability people
[1:17] talk about fortitude and the ability to
[1:20] stand up to trials but when you've got
[1:21] nothing left to give and you've done
[1:23] everything you can do it's in that
[1:25] moment that the comforter comes and he
[1:27] stands for you
[1:29] and he stands in you and he causes you
[1:31] to realize that your redeemer liveth
[1:35] amen
[1:36] hallelujah
[1:38] you see he provides peace he provides
[1:40] the words
[1:42] we don't know what to pray
[1:44] see because we're poor comforters we
[1:46] don't know how to comfort other people
[1:47] we also don't know how to pray for
[1:49] ourselves
[1:51] that's what the bible says many times we
[1:54] don't know how to pray
[1:56] and the bible in romans 8 26 says
[1:59] likewise the spirit also helpeth our
[2:01] infirmities our weaknesses for we know
[2:03] not what we should pray for as we ought
[2:06] but the spirit itself
[2:09] i love this
[2:11] amen he makes intercession for us
[2:15] one standing by us an attorney an
[2:17] advocate somebody standing there that
[2:19] speaks in our behalf i heard someone say
[2:22] today that
[2:24] it was a politician actually but it
[2:25] really intrigued me what he was saying
[2:27] he said what people want is somebody
[2:28] like them but who can put it better than
[2:31] they can put it
[2:32] right so you want somebody to say to
[2:35] reflect you but you want somebody that
[2:36] can put it better than what you could
[2:38] put it
[2:40] because if i was standing there in
[2:41] washington i wouldn't be able to to
[2:43] bring a i'd have all kinds of thoughts
[2:45] going you know all kinds of things but
[2:47] you want somebody who can put it better
[2:49] than you can put it
[2:50] the holy spirit is the one
[2:54] hallelujah
[2:55] when your prayer gets jumbled and you
[2:56] don't know how to pray for what you
[2:58] really need
[3:00] that's why we need to pray in the spirit
[3:03] we need to we need to preach in the
[3:04] spirit we need to worship in the spirit
[3:07] because when we do these things in the
[3:08] spirit of god the holy spirit actually
[3:10] is the one who knows how to put it
[3:12] better than you do
[3:15] he rearranges the letters
[3:17] that the little boy pray in his abcs and
[3:19] the holy spirit takes that makes it mean
[3:22] something
[3:25] how many times have i preached a sermon
[3:26] i thought was a complete flop
[3:29] honestly i walk away from the pulpit
[3:30] think i'll never touch that subject
[3:32] again and somebody come up to me late
[3:34] later and it did something in their life
[3:37] you think why because it wasn't me it
[3:39] was because the holy spirit
[3:41] come and took the words
[3:43] and put it better than i could put it
[3:47] hallelujah aren't you glad he still does
[3:49] that today that's why we believe in live
[3:52] preaching even today because the holy
[3:54] spirit gets into it and he carries the
[3:56] words to the hearts of the listener and
[3:58] puts it better than what we could put it
[4:01] hallelujah
[4:03] amen
[4:05] he that searcheth the hearts knoweth
[4:07] what is the mind of the spirit because
[4:09] he maketh intercession for the saints
[4:11] according to the will of god now watch
[4:15] we have comfort it gives us comfort we
[4:17] have comfort through the word
[4:19] as we said the comforter is the word
[4:21] john 14 26 but the comforter which is
[4:23] the holy ghost whom the father will send
[4:25] in my name he shall teach you all things
[4:28] and bring all things to your remembrance
[4:31] whatsoever i have said unto you
[4:33] how be it when he the spirit of truth is
[4:35] come he will guide you into all truth
[4:37] for he shall not speak of himself but
[4:40] whatsoever he shall hear that shall he
[4:41] speak
[4:42] and he will show you things
[4:44] to come
[4:47] now
[4:48] there was someone in the scripture
[4:50] that really had to deal with with
[4:52] suffering and all of a steel as i said
[4:54] with suffering i don't want to
[4:56] particularly point anybody out tonight
[4:58] but if you're here
[4:59] you deal with with suffering but some of
[5:02] you have dealt with suffering on a level
[5:03] that i can't even comprehend
[5:05] i think job probably dealt with it in a
[5:08] way that none of us can really
[5:09] comprehend
[5:11] because it was just such a massive loss
[5:14] and some of you would understand joe
[5:15] better than i do
[5:17] but maybe not completely
[5:20] and brother brown said there was a
[5:22] prophet one time by the name of job and
[5:23] he needed some comfort and his church
[5:25] members come
[5:27] condemning him
[5:29] now there's something interesting
[5:33] and brother branham puts this he must
[5:34] have had experience with this
[5:36] because he puts this like a pastor like
[5:38] job is the pastor of a church and i
[5:40] think we could all put us in there put
[5:42] ourselves in there not just as pastors
[5:44] but whatever office you feel in the
[5:45] church whatever part you are of the body
[5:48] and here here job has done nothing but
[5:50] try to help these people right and try
[5:52] to preach to these people
[5:54] and here comes his his congregation you
[5:58] know he says job you're doing pretty bad
[6:00] got coveted
[6:02] you got these balls and you got all
[6:04] these these problems you must be doing
[6:06] something wrong
[6:12] i think god i don't have a church like
[6:13] job did
[6:16] i don't know what i'd do with people
[6:17] like that brother
[6:20] they were his friends i can't imagine
[6:22] the ones that were against him i know
[6:23] what they said
[6:26] but his best friends come up to him and
[6:28] brother branham said that was his
[6:29] congregation
[6:31] and he's job you're just not right with
[6:32] god but see church members don't always
[6:34] understand
[6:38] and there's nowhere in the scripture
[6:39] that says that these were ungodly men
[6:43] right they were not men that were just
[6:46] out there somewhere these were good
[6:47] godly christian church members
[6:50] what we would call them today
[6:52] but they don't get it
[6:55] and they can't
[6:57] they didn't lose all their kids in a day
[7:01] right
[7:02] they can't know what job's going through
[7:05] and and they even they're they're
[7:06] arguing with job they're getting they
[7:08] have the wrong argument
[7:10] it's a completely wrong argument that
[7:12] they have
[7:13] until elihu comes along being the
[7:15] youngest of all of them and is actually
[7:18] able to represent christ to job and
[7:20] bring the argument up to a different
[7:21] level because there was some things that
[7:23] job did wrong in that
[7:25] and i've heard that recently someone
[7:27] said well god was rebuking job's three
[7:29] friends when no god never said anything
[7:31] to his three friends
[7:33] he come rebuke job
[7:36] but he did it in a in the right way
[7:39] right where the three friends didn't
[7:40] understand church members don't always
[7:42] understand the people we go to church
[7:44] with don't always understand they just
[7:46] don't get it sometimes they're just it's
[7:48] impossible for them to get it
[7:52] look
[7:53] they condemned him he said but he still
[7:55] needed a comforter
[7:57] his wife couldn't even comfort him
[8:02] and sometimes we if we're not careful we
[8:04] we raised our expectations of our spouse
[8:06] i can just preach tonight i i don't know
[8:08] if they got the streaming fixed or not
[8:09] but i'll just pretend it's not fixed
[8:14] they got you know
[8:15] his wife come to him and we think that
[8:17] we elevate our spouses to the point
[8:19] where my my husband's gonna fix this
[8:22] my wife's gonna fix this sometimes they
[8:24] can't
[8:27] right there's some things you need
[8:29] somebody standing by you who knows you
[8:32] better
[8:34] amen
[8:35] then even your wife does
[8:38] i'll say that this time
[8:39] that we spent and coveted was different
[8:41] from last time in the sense that me and
[8:42] my wife kind of got closer together
[8:45] and and i enjoyed this time some
[8:47] respects i know the kids didn't enjoy it
[8:49] much me being home and them not being
[8:50] able to go to school but
[8:52] but and they're still not able to go to
[8:53] school because now the school's shut
[8:54] down but for the next couple of days but
[8:58] we
[8:59] we got actually closer together but as
[9:01] close as you can get
[9:03] your wife doesn't know everything
[9:09] i hope you're hearing me tonight
[9:12] and and some people say well if i just
[9:13] had a wife if i just had a husband
[9:16] then there'd be somebody i could talk to
[9:18] and it is a great comfort
[9:19] it is a great comfort i won't deny that
[9:23] but there's somebody that knows you
[9:24] better
[9:27] and sometimes that'll cause problems in
[9:29] marriages because we think well
[9:31] if they would just if they could
[9:32] understand me better no don't don't lay
[9:35] that off on them
[9:37] the holy spirit knows
[9:39] he knows you better than you know
[9:41] yourself and he knows what you really
[9:42] need
[9:44] no they condemned him and his wife said
[9:45] she said job you ought to curse god and
[9:47] then die to death but he said thou speak
[9:49] us like a foolish woman and job stayed
[9:52] with it until god provided for him a
[9:55] vision of jesus christ
[9:58] he said it said when the vision came he
[10:00] said i know my redeemer liveth
[10:03] at the last days he'll stand upon the
[10:05] earth and i've said many times
[10:07] and and i've never really looked at it i
[10:09] guess and i've heard this sermon before
[10:11] but i guess i never really looked at it
[10:13] the way brother branham is looking at it
[10:14] here exactly but i have said many times
[10:17] that job
[10:18] you know god never explained to him why
[10:20] he went through what he went through
[10:23] he never told him why he just showed him
[10:25] a vision
[10:27] right he showed him his redeemer
[10:29] but now watch the way brother branham
[10:31] puts it i guess i haven't put it in this
[10:33] way that i remember before
[10:35] but he says now remember the vision is
[10:38] he said he saw jesus
[10:40] and jesus is the word then when job
[10:43] needed a comforter god sent him a vision
[10:46] of
[10:47] the word
[10:50] amen that's why we've got to have the
[10:52] holy ghost in this day and hour because
[10:54] it's the holy ghost that comes on the
[10:55] inside and it's the inside teacher to
[10:58] teach you the word that's not just about
[11:00] the millennium and about about the the
[11:02] three comings of christ and those things
[11:04] he's not just teaching you about that
[11:07] he's teaching you
[11:09] amen how to be comforted
[11:11] how to have peace that passes all
[11:13] understanding he's teaching you when
[11:15] friends go away from you and family goes
[11:17] away from you and everything's going
[11:19] wrong he's teaching you i'm the god that
[11:21] heals all your diseases i'm the one
[11:23] who's got your kids
[11:25] held in the palm of my hand i'm the one
[11:27] that's got it all in control he's
[11:29] teaching you that insight i can tell you
[11:31] those things but when he tells you those
[11:33] things it's something different
[11:35] what happened what did god do for job
[11:37] god sent him when job needed a comforter
[11:40] god sent him a vision of the word
[11:44] oh hallelujah he said that's the comfort
[11:47] i get is reading the word believing the
[11:50] word what the word says jesus said let
[11:52] every man's word be a lie and mind be
[11:54] true
[11:55] he says i don't care what someone else
[11:57] says i respect what they say but when it
[11:59] comes to believing if it's contrary to
[12:01] god's word i don't believe it
[12:03] he says
[12:04] he says
[12:05] i do not believe nothing but what god's
[12:07] word said for men shall live by every
[12:09] word that comes out of the mouth of god
[12:11] not just so much of the word
[12:14] i've tried to live my life like that god
[12:16] help me to continue to do that that
[12:18] i love people there's nothing brother
[12:20] brandon put it this way he said you
[12:21] believe that if you something else if
[12:23] you want to but i've got to stay with
[12:24] the word
[12:25] i'm not going to not love you because
[12:27] you believe something different i'm
[12:29] going to continue to love you and pray
[12:31] for you but i've got to stay with the
[12:32] word
[12:33] with the revelation of the word that
[12:35] we've been given in this hour i've got
[12:37] to stay with the word you go on do
[12:39] whatever you want to do i'm not going to
[12:40] put you out of the kingdom but i've got
[12:42] to stay with the word
[12:44] because the word is the comforter that's
[12:46] the only
[12:47] i don't see a way out of life without
[12:48] the word
[12:51] you know life is brutal
[12:53] i'm not sugar coating it tonight but it
[12:55] just is
[12:57] i got to looking at my
[12:59] calendar in there and this is just a
[13:01] little thing but maybe it'll give you a
[13:02] little example what life is like and and
[13:07] i looked at my calendar and i thought
[13:08] man our december calendar was messed up
[13:11] everything we tried to do got changed at
[13:13] least once
[13:15] and and and the services that got
[13:17] canceled and the ones we thought we were
[13:19] gonna take certain ones off and end up
[13:20] being out of church forever and and it
[13:22] just seemed like isn't it good to be
[13:24] back in the house of the lord
[13:26] amen for those of us that could be
[13:27] tonight and i understand why some people
[13:29] wouldn't be able to come and some are
[13:30] still sick and and some are afraid of
[13:33] getting sick and again i have
[13:34] absolutely no judgment on that because i
[13:36] know it's a difficult time
[13:38] but you understand that
[13:40] that just being able to be together is a
[13:42] big deal because we don't know what
[13:43] tomorrow holds
[13:45] and that calendar it really doesn't mean
[13:47] anything
[13:49] i have it to try to keep my thoughts
[13:50] organized to remind me what to do but he
[13:53] jesus could come tomorrow
[13:55] then what good does my calendar do
[13:58] right
[13:59] and sometimes the rain just comes and i
[14:01] come across something today that said
[14:02] well said the best thing to do if it
[14:05] rains is just to let it rain
[14:10] isn't that right
[14:11] sometimes you just have to let it rain
[14:14] and find some good in it
[14:17] i remember as a kid we'd go to the cafe
[14:19] and the farmers were always in the cafe
[14:20] every day every day the farmers would be
[14:22] in the cafe if it was hot they
[14:23] complained about the heat
[14:25] if it was raining they complained about
[14:26] the rain
[14:28] if it was
[14:29] if there was a government surplus they
[14:30] complained about the government not
[14:31] giving them any of the surplus there was
[14:33] a government deficit they complained
[14:34] about that didn't matter what was going
[14:36] on in politics what it was they always
[14:38] gathered together to complain
[14:40] but the best thing to do about rain if
[14:42] it's gonna rain let it rain
[14:45] figure out how to use the rain amen you
[14:48] must need it
[14:50] oh god it's a hard attitude to take but
[14:53] but you know there must be a reason why
[14:55] things happen the way that they do
[14:57] and and i'm not big enough to figure out
[14:59] what that is that's why we've got to
[15:01] stay with the word
[15:03] because if we start attaching meanings
[15:05] to things beyond and give them a
[15:08] significance beyond what they actually
[15:10] have what we end up with we end up
[15:12] putting ourselves over in
[15:13] in the tribulation period we end up with
[15:16] a gloom and doom gospel we end up where
[15:18] nobody's going to make it but i know
[15:20] somebody's going to make it
[15:22] the bride's going to make it no one else
[15:24] may but the bride will who's the bride
[15:26] with a bit i don't know but i'm gonna
[15:28] believe for every one of you
[15:30] huh why wouldn't i
[15:33] why would i want you to go to
[15:34] tribulation
[15:36] why would i want myself to go to
[15:37] tribulation i'm gonna believe for every
[15:38] one of us and then what the other pastor
[15:40] could you know take care of his own
[15:42] church
[15:44] right does that make sense
[15:46] there's no reason to live in a gloom in
[15:48] doom and despair and all the all kinds
[15:51] of things coming on the earth and some
[15:53] people live in that apocalyptic world
[15:54] view where everything's coming
[15:56] everything's going downhill
[15:58] as fast as it can go i'll tell you what
[16:00] i know one thing that's not going
[16:02] downhill of all the things that are
[16:03] going downhill there's one thing that's
[16:05] not that's the bride of jesus christ the
[16:07] bride of jesus christ is going up
[16:11] it may get darker before it gets lighter
[16:13] but i'll tell you this there is a bride
[16:15] on the earth today that is going up
[16:17] every step they take is pressing forward
[16:20] it's going upward it's not falling down
[16:24] this bride cannot fall
[16:27] i'm going to be a part of that
[16:31] why would i believe anything different
[16:33] if i don't make it i pray that you have
[16:34] the faith to make it
[16:37] but why would i believe anything
[16:38] differently
[16:40] it makes no sense to live in a doom and
[16:42] gloom
[16:43] now look
[16:45] you see we have a comforter the word
[16:48] always come back to the word
[16:50] but the branham said
[16:52] he said all the word the whole bible
[16:54] through man shall live by every word
[16:55] that proceeds out of the mouth of god
[16:57] and he said no that's how man lives
[16:58] that's god's provided way for him to
[17:00] live
[17:01] he said and job was the prophet that
[17:02] lived even before the bible was written
[17:03] notice he was a prophet and the word of
[17:05] the lord comes to the prophet
[17:07] and when he wanted comfort he could find
[17:09] none
[17:10] he went to his church and his church
[17:11] didn't have any comfort for him but
[17:13] accusation against him but he stayed
[17:16] until god showed him the word
[17:19] by vision and then he was comforted he
[17:22] didn't have the written word like we did
[17:23] but he had a vision amen
[17:26] he was a prayer hallelujah
[17:28] aren't you glad we're able to see
[17:30] we don't necessarily we don't
[17:31] necessarily have visions ourselves
[17:32] although i believe a person could have a
[17:34] vision but but we're not prophets major
[17:36] prophets you understand we're not seers
[17:38] i don't know that there's anybody here
[17:40] that has visions but i'll tell you this
[17:42] we were able to stand on the shoulder of
[17:43] somebody who did
[17:46] hallelujah and god showed job a vision
[17:49] and then he was comforted he stayed on
[17:52] his feet and the lightnings flashed and
[17:54] the thunders roared he said though the
[17:56] skin worms destroy this body yet in my
[17:57] flesh till i see god
[17:59] he said he talked to me
[18:01] let death or anything else strike me it
[18:04] doesn't make a bit of difference because
[18:06] i'll see god
[18:08] i saw the vision of his word
[18:10] oh i wonder tonight have you seen the
[18:12] vision of his word you see colvin you
[18:15] see you see the world going downhill
[18:17] like it is but do you see the vision of
[18:19] the word
[18:21] that vision said the bride's going up
[18:24] the vision doesn't deny that there's a
[18:25] worldly church that's going down that
[18:27] vision doesn't deny that there's
[18:29] standards are going downhill holiness is
[18:31] a is a
[18:32] by bygone thing for many people but
[18:35] there is a bride on the face of the
[18:36] earth that's going up
[18:38] we don't deny those other things are
[18:40] true but there's got to be a bride
[18:43] hallelujah i'm getting into sunday
[18:44] sermon here we'll
[18:46] we won't get very far in that but now
[18:47] look
[18:48] let's go back to this comforter he said
[18:51] the comforter now
[18:53] i want you to notice something about the
[18:54] comforter
[18:55] and i'm kinda i know i don't have very
[18:58] long tonight so you just bear with me
[19:00] i'll be done in 20 minutes
[19:02] whether we're done or not
[19:07] the comforter will correct you
[19:10] do you know that
[19:11] that inside teacher will correct you
[19:14] he come he even convicts the world of
[19:15] sin that's his job
[19:18] but he will not accuse you
[19:21] the comforters he jobs friends brought
[19:23] accusations
[19:25] the church members bring accusations
[19:27] the comforter will never accuse you
[19:31] he don't play that role
[19:35] right in god's great drama he's the
[19:38] attorney not the prosecutor
[19:41] i want you to understand something about
[19:43] the holy ghost the holy ghost will never
[19:45] accuse you
[19:47] he will convict you
[19:49] but he will not accuse you
[19:53] oh my
[19:54] many people think they're under
[19:56] conviction and and really living under
[19:58] condemnation and the bible says there is
[20:01] therefore no now no condemnation them
[20:03] that are in christ jesus he walk after
[20:05] the the spirit and not the flesh
[20:08] now look
[20:10] satan is the prosecutor
[20:12] the holy spirit the comforter works for
[20:14] the defense
[20:15] and this word comforter means advocate
[20:17] again literally the one standing by you
[20:19] but it's the legal term
[20:21] it's the one who stands there and voices
[20:23] on your behalf to the judge
[20:26] you see satan is known as the accuser in
[20:28] revelation 12 10 he said the accuser of
[20:31] our brethren is cast down
[20:33] the accuser which accused him before our
[20:35] god
[20:36] day
[20:37] and
[20:38] night
[20:40] right that's his job
[20:42] one thing he does he never fails to
[20:45] accuse the
[20:46] brethren but the holy spirit is not an
[20:49] accuser
[20:51] i hope we get this today it's one way
[20:54] you can differentiate between true and
[20:56] false ministries
[20:59] right false ministries take on the
[21:02] attitude of the accuser
[21:05] right now it doesn't mean that the true
[21:07] ministry won't preach things that are
[21:09] very straight
[21:10] but they don't take on the attitude of
[21:12] the accuser
[21:14] i hope you understand this
[21:17] here's how brother brown talks about
[21:18] that he said have you ever noticed how
[21:19] the people who lead others astray
[21:22] bind them closely to themselves by fear
[21:26] they say that if the people don't do
[21:28] what they say
[21:31] or if they leave
[21:34] i hope you get a revelation of this
[21:35] tonight
[21:36] because every time something bad that
[21:38] happens i'll tell you what you think
[21:39] because the same thing that i think what
[21:40] did i do wrong
[21:43] and then the accuser comes by through
[21:45] some preacher
[21:47] or through some person as well if you
[21:49] hadn't done that
[21:51] and it may have been something not even
[21:53] that we're not talking about sin we're
[21:54] just talking about some decision you
[21:56] made if you hadn't done that you've been
[21:57] okay
[21:59] don't let the accuser talk to you in
[22:00] that way
[22:04] he's taking on even if there's a person
[22:06] that meant well but they're taking on
[22:08] the attitude of accuser what if you
[22:09] hadn't done that that's not the way god
[22:11] holds people to him
[22:13] he don't hold people he don't first of
[22:15] all he doesn't bind them people to
[22:17] himself as well brother branham says
[22:19] that in the church but not for one
[22:20] moment
[22:21] he said do i do that
[22:23] i don't he didn't come to bring a
[22:24] message to bind us to him
[22:26] but to bind us with love bonds to christ
[22:30] if brother branham was a cult leader he
[22:31] was very poor in his job
[22:35] right because with a gift like that if
[22:36] you were going to be a cult leader you
[22:38] could have held the people by fear
[22:43] you absolutely could
[22:44] because you knew things about people
[22:47] and knowledge about people is power
[22:49] that's why some pastors are able to hold
[22:50] people and you wonder how do they keep
[22:52] so many people in their church for so
[22:54] many years and they're not and all they
[22:56] do is preach nonsense
[23:00] gloom and doom and catastrophe
[23:02] constantly and they get to where they
[23:03] don't even have to preach hardly
[23:05] be gone half the time handle the money
[23:07] any way they want to
[23:08] excuse me for preaching like this
[23:09] tonight but you spare with me i'm
[23:11] preaching it myself i guess
[23:13] you know other pastors here that i know
[23:15] of
[23:16] but look how do they get you i've always
[23:18] wondered how do they get people because
[23:19] they know a lot of things about people
[23:23] and if somebody raises up and says
[23:25] something they'll preach at them for
[23:26] about six weeks
[23:28] right until the voice quietens down
[23:31] well i really did do that
[23:34] i really was like that i really don't
[23:35] worship enough
[23:37] you know when the pastor he come preach
[23:39] when he saw that i was raising up to
[23:41] have a different idea than he did then
[23:43] he preached against people who don't
[23:44] worship enough for six weeks and i guess
[23:46] i'm just not you know i'm not qualified
[23:48] to have that that position
[23:50] you've all i'm sure you've been there
[23:53] if you haven't i have
[23:55] i come up under the best
[23:59] they say if people don't do what they
[24:00] say or if they leave then destruction
[24:03] will follow what is that an accuser
[24:07] an accuser and it's a way of because you
[24:10] know things about people but if brother
[24:11] branham was to go back to my original
[24:13] thought if he wanted to be a call leader
[24:14] he could have come out with true things
[24:16] about people he knew these things he
[24:18] could have known things about people
[24:20] that they didn't even tell him
[24:23] because the holy spirit knew the secrets
[24:25] of the heart but brother branham never
[24:26] used it in that way
[24:31] i think of
[24:32] y'all just bear with me for a moment but
[24:34] brother perry green tells a story about
[24:36] brother branham knowing something about
[24:37] him
[24:38] and one of the things that he and
[24:40] brother branham never says this publicly
[24:42] brother perry was a great man of god
[24:45] but brother perry and he'll he would
[24:47] tell you this while he was alive when he
[24:49] was young he had a it was a very
[24:50] passionate man he had a problem with bad
[24:52] thoughts
[24:54] and brother branham knew that about him
[24:56] not because brother perry told him but
[24:57] brother perry he discerned that about
[24:59] brother perry he said brother prayer you
[25:00] always have to keep that guarded
[25:03] brother perry told him on himself
[25:04] brother branham never told it
[25:09] it's important
[25:11] that we don't mind people
[25:12] by fear
[25:15] they say if people don't do what they
[25:16] say or if they leave then destruction
[25:17] will follow they are false prophets
[25:20] no matter how long they've been
[25:22] preaching
[25:24] right they are false prophets
[25:26] for a true prophet always lead one to
[25:28] the word and bind the people to jesus
[25:29] christ and he won't tell the people to
[25:31] fear him or what he says but to fear
[25:33] what the word says
[25:35] amen
[25:37] amen listen we have an advocate not an
[25:39] accuser aren't you glad for that tonight
[25:41] an advocate not an accuser listen first
[25:44] john two and one my little children
[25:45] these things right i unto you that you
[25:47] sin not and if any man's sin we have an
[25:49] advocate
[25:50] with the father jesus christ the
[25:52] righteous i should tell you right there
[25:53] that the holy spirit is jesus christ
[25:56] the spirit of christ
[25:58] and he is the propitiation for our sins
[26:00] so he's not only the advocate but he's
[26:02] actually the propitiation he's the one
[26:04] who paid for it
[26:07] hallelujah not for ours only but also
[26:09] for the sins of the whole world but the
[26:11] brahmana said what is the holy ghost
[26:12] it's an advocate what is an advocate or
[26:14] what does it do it makes an advocate it
[26:16] has mercy
[26:18] hallelujah it stands in your place
[26:22] oh listen to this tonight church it does
[26:24] things that you can't do
[26:27] hallelujah it's a propitiation for your
[26:29] sins it's your right oh somebody ought
[26:31] to preach with me tonight it's your
[26:32] righteousness it's your healing it's
[26:35] your life it's your resurrection it's
[26:38] all that god has for you
[26:40] he's an advocate
[26:42] hallelujah he said how we could go into
[26:44] details with that and break that down of
[26:46] how that when it makes intercession for
[26:48] our ignorance sometimes he said when we
[26:50] got the holy ghost we ignorantly stagger
[26:52] into something
[26:54] have you ever done that
[26:56] we make a decision and we get six months
[26:58] from now we look back at them and say
[26:59] now i got no time to pray i got no time
[27:01] to read my bible
[27:04] why did i do that we ignorantly stagger
[27:07] into something
[27:08] but the holy spirit is there
[27:14] oh hallelujah just don't want to make me
[27:16] go out and make bad decisions that once
[27:18] it makes me want to love him that much
[27:20] more
[27:21] give him that much more time
[27:24] hallelujah the holy spirit is there to
[27:26] make advocate for us he is our advocate
[27:28] or he stands he's our attorney he stands
[27:30] there and pleads for us we don't plead
[27:33] for ourself
[27:34] because the holy ghost in us pleads
[27:37] for us as i said he puts it better than
[27:39] we could
[27:41] you realize that's the only difference
[27:42] in you and an attorney
[27:44] you know many of the basics of the law
[27:46] but the attorney knows how to put it in
[27:48] front of the judge
[27:50] amen in such a way that it will convince
[27:52] the judge listen the holy spirit knows
[27:54] how to hey man how to advocate for you
[27:59] amen
[28:00] he stands there and pleads for us
[28:02] he we don't plead for ourselves because
[28:04] the holy ghost in us pleads for us the
[28:06] holy spirit giving utterance sometimes
[28:08] with words you can't understand and he
[28:11] makes intercessions for us that's what
[28:12] the holy ghost is listen what what i
[28:15] really need when i'm really in trouble
[28:18] when i really when i'm really i
[28:20] appreciate all of you praying for me and
[28:21] this week like i said it was much better
[28:23] than the first time you got to get
[28:24] covered twice might as well do it like i
[28:26] did it
[28:27] but the first time was much harder than
[28:28] it was this time
[28:30] but i'm glad you prayed for me what i
[28:32] need when i'm in a dark place what you
[28:34] need when you're in a dark place it's
[28:36] not so much somebody that can come and
[28:38] present to you the right words and
[28:39] that's what job's three friends didn't
[28:41] get job needed amen to get a vision of
[28:44] the word
[28:46] and i can't give you that but what i can
[28:48] do is i can speak the word and then i
[28:51] can and i can say the things that the
[28:53] holy spirit inspires me to say but i can
[28:56] pray for you and when i pray for you i
[28:59] know when i get in the spirit that the
[29:02] holy spirit knows just how to put it
[29:07] amen i might pray for you for something
[29:09] you don't need
[29:11] you might come and say brother ben pray
[29:12] that i get at this new job and i'll
[29:14] start praying about that and the holy
[29:16] spirit maybe won't tell me whether it's
[29:18] a good thing or a bad thing but he knows
[29:19] how to put it
[29:23] he knows exactly how to pray on your
[29:26] behalf
[29:28] amen
[29:30] listen
[29:31] brother madam said the holy spirit
[29:32] giving utterance sometimes with words
[29:33] you can't understand he makes
[29:34] intercession for us that's what the holy
[29:36] ghost is
[29:38] when i walk into anything watch this
[29:41] i walk like a little
[29:44] kid
[29:46] you feel like you're walking like a kid
[29:49] and i'm not talking about these big boys
[29:50] sitting up here
[29:52] wherever my daughter is right now
[29:55] when i walk into anything
[29:57] i walk like a little kid
[30:01] like a little kid that's just learning
[30:03] how to walk
[30:05] you walk like a little fellow that's how
[30:08] we walk with god
[30:12] what do you do
[30:13] when you what do you do with your little
[30:15] child with your toddler these boys can
[30:17] run around we don't
[30:18] bother with them with a little child
[30:20] just learning how to walk what do you do
[30:22] you grab their hand
[30:26] the one standing by you is not your
[30:27] pastor
[30:29] the one holding your hand through the
[30:30] most difficult moments of life is not
[30:32] your pastor though i want to be there
[30:33] for you
[30:34] but it's the comforter
[30:36] are you with me now
[30:38] it's not your church member though
[30:40] church members though we would love for
[30:41] to be able to comfort one another and we
[30:43] should do that as the body of christ but
[30:45] the one closest to you
[30:47] who's able to hold you up as you walk
[30:49] like a little child
[30:52] is christ
[30:54] the advocate
[30:55] who walked
[30:57] perfectly
[31:00] he's already won amen he's walked
[31:02] perfectly see i haven't walked perfectly
[31:04] so you can't this was the problem with
[31:07] the man becoming the message
[31:10] right when i make my life the example
[31:12] for everything that you go through
[31:13] that's a problem even brother branham's
[31:15] life can't be used like that because
[31:17] when a man becomes the message in that
[31:18] sense
[31:20] right when a man becomes the message in
[31:21] the sense that we just look at his life
[31:22] and try to emulate him he didn't walk
[31:24] perfectly
[31:26] nobody did
[31:27] amen but christ did
[31:30] and when i can hold the hand of jesus
[31:32] christ i know he'll lead me exactly
[31:34] where he wants me to be
[31:37] but we walk like a little kid
[31:39] you walk like a little fellow we're
[31:40] walking in a dark world full of enemies
[31:42] full of sin full of traps full of
[31:44] everything
[31:45] you say oh i'm afraid
[31:48] i'm afraid to take christian life i'm
[31:50] afraid to do this i'm afraid i'll do
[31:53] this but joel we talked about this
[31:54] before you started preaching look many
[31:56] times you walk in and you're asked to
[31:58] take an office in the church you're
[31:59] asked to do something to help out and
[32:01] you become afraid
[32:03] because you're afraid how you act
[32:05] you're afraid of what you might do
[32:09] the rest of you may have halos but i
[32:11] don't
[32:15] you don't want to disappoint the people
[32:16] again
[32:23] well i'm afraid i'm afraid to do this
[32:25] i'm afraid i'll do this
[32:28] don't be afraid
[32:31] we have an advocate
[32:34] oh i'm so glad he's right here by me
[32:37] you realize what gay brother branham the
[32:38] confidence and he deals with this in
[32:40] this sermon when he talks about the
[32:42] comforter he deals with the fact that
[32:43] how he's not afraid to say whatever the
[32:45] holy spirit tells him to say
[32:47] he's not afraid when he says he said
[32:49] brother madam aren't you afraid and he
[32:51] says no he's always there with me
[32:54] hallelujah he said and he promised me he
[32:56] would never leave me
[32:58] so wherever you go i'll be with you like
[33:00] joshua he said he said be of good
[33:02] courage i'll be with you i'll stay with
[33:04] you and so he said he had the confidence
[33:06] that the angel was there listen even
[33:08] when you can't feel him even when you
[33:09] can't see him he said i'll be the one
[33:11] who holds your hand
[33:13] i'm the comforter i'll be the one that's
[33:15] closed by you
[33:17] hallelujah and this is why i said it's
[33:19] expedient for you that i go away because
[33:21] while i'm here in a body i can only be
[33:23] physically present when i'm actually
[33:25] there but there will come a time when
[33:27] you'll be scattered to the four corners
[33:28] of the earth and i'll be with each and
[33:30] every one of you
[33:31] walking in your homes walking is while
[33:33] you work walking with you while you go
[33:35] to church walking with you while you
[33:37] trying to preach walking with you why
[33:38] are you trying to deal with your loved
[33:40] ones walking with you while you walk
[33:41] through the valley of the shadow of
[33:42] death he said i'll hold your hand
[33:50] hallelujah i don't know i can't
[33:53] like i said i can't
[33:55] put a value in your suffering
[33:57] but he's with you
[34:00] yeah though i walk through the valley of
[34:01] the shadow of death
[34:04] hallelujah oh i believe he is
[34:08] i believe he's walking with you today
[34:11] amen
[34:13] now look
[34:15] don't be afraid we have an advocate
[34:17] he stands by us he's in us and he makes
[34:19] intercessions for us
[34:20] the holy spirit constantly
[34:23] making an advocate for us all the time
[34:26] what was the devil doing all the time
[34:28] satan was an accuser day and night
[34:30] what's the holy ghost all the time
[34:33] being an advocate
[34:36] now
[34:37] and i'll touch this last point just
[34:39] briefly and then we'll go
[34:41] but he said when the comforters come in
[34:43] john 15 26 whom i will send unto you
[34:45] from the father even the spirit of truth
[34:47] which proceedeth from the father
[34:49] he shall testify of me
[34:52] now what does that mean he'll testify me
[34:53] it means he'll he'll manifest me
[34:56] he'll manifest me so one of the ways
[34:59] that the comforter works in our life is
[35:01] by manifesting the word of the hour in
[35:05] our lives and in the lives of people
[35:07] around us that we see and when we see
[35:09] that manifestation it gives us comfort
[35:13] that's right now brother brown said he
[35:15] would give us another comforter i'm
[35:16] going to speed through this so just bear
[35:18] with me for a moment but he said
[35:20] in the days of paul he talks about how
[35:22] he said if one come in among you and you
[35:24] all speak with tongues there's no
[35:25] interpreter then the unbeliever will say
[35:26] you're mad but if there'd be one
[35:28] prophesy and reveal the secret of the
[35:29] heart fall down and say truly god is
[35:31] with you he said here we are in this day
[35:33] with that same comforter manifesting
[35:36] himself in the same way that he did then
[35:38] he said what a consolation with a
[35:40] promise now
[35:41] what was it he cared so much christ did
[35:44] for his disciples that he manifested
[35:47] himself to them brother branham brought
[35:49] that out and he said he cared so much
[35:51] for the message of today that he allowed
[35:53] himself to be manifested in a way that
[35:56] we can see
[35:57] that he's still alive
[36:00] are you glad for the message of the hour
[36:03] do you realize that the manifestation of
[36:05] the sign of the son of man helps you
[36:07] through suffering
[36:10] think about it
[36:12] oh my it helps you can you imagine that
[36:14] first church age what it must have been
[36:16] like they went through
[36:18] they were dragged they were torn apart
[36:20] by dogs
[36:21] they were poured hot oil poured on them
[36:24] and you think why didn't they give up
[36:26] why didn't they give in well many of
[36:27] them had seen
[36:29] god in his reality
[36:31] they'd seen him manifested in christ on
[36:34] the in the flesh but even the paul
[36:35] himself had never seen christ but he saw
[36:38] god manifesting himself in his own
[36:40] ministry
[36:41] and because he saw jesus christ
[36:43] manifesting himself and doing what he
[36:45] promised that he would do oh church we
[36:47] could only see the reality of this today
[36:50] it brought a comfort he said death where
[36:52] is your sting grave where is your
[36:54] victory
[36:55] i can walk through it because you
[36:57] manifest yourself to me
[36:59] brother brown said jesus cared enough
[37:00] for the message of today to bring these
[37:02] same things to pass as he said till he
[37:05] died and rose again to send them by the
[37:06] holy spirit the comforter to show his
[37:08] ministry today that he's still alive
[37:12] very bad
[37:14] he said he cared enough to make a
[37:15] statement
[37:17] he cared because he loved you he cared
[37:19] enough to do it to send the holy spirit
[37:21] to make this ministry today
[37:25] hallelujah
[37:26] i like this and paragraph 152 if he
[37:28] cares do you care he said now he sent
[37:31] the holy ghost and in this day of
[37:32] intellectual conception that he might by
[37:35] the same holy spirit prove through us
[37:38] that he's still the messiah
[37:40] prove it
[37:41] in the same way the bible says we're we
[37:43] are the epistle of christ written not
[37:45] with ink but with the spirit of the
[37:47] living god not in tables of stone but in
[37:49] fleshy tables of the heart listen he
[37:52] said how can i comfort my friends how
[37:54] can i comfort my relatives by becoming
[37:56] the manifestation of the word for your
[37:58] day
[37:59] when they say hey man oh i'm in a great
[38:01] comfort can you you've been to funerals
[38:04] where someone began to talk about the
[38:06] life that someone lived
[38:08] and it's a great comfort isn't it
[38:12] what is it the manifestation of the word
[38:16] come on
[38:17] you know that's true you see it and
[38:18] sometimes that's hard because a person
[38:20] you just have to have faith for that
[38:21] person
[38:23] but listen you manifesting the life that
[38:25] you live to your relatives and friends
[38:28] means something
[38:29] it gives them comfort
[38:32] amen
[38:34] oh god
[38:39] you realize it gives your grandkids
[38:40] comfort to know that you come to church
[38:42] on wednesday night
[38:44] yes it does it gives them comfort to
[38:47] know they may not be living the life
[38:48] that they need to live but they know
[38:50] that granddad's in church grandma's in
[38:52] church
[38:54] i hope you hear me there's somebody
[38:56] there who can pray for them why because
[38:58] you become the word in flesh
[39:01] there's somebody there who reads their
[39:02] bible oh man it's a great comfort to
[39:04] know
[39:05] it's a comfort to me
[39:07] if we don't have streaming tonight my
[39:08] mom won't hear it but i know my mother
[39:10] prays my mother has a lot of faults just
[39:12] like all of us do but i know my mother
[39:15] prays it's a great comfort to me to know
[39:17] that my mother knows how to pray
[39:19] it's a great comfort to me
[39:22] to know that some of you know how to
[39:23] pray
[39:26] it's a great comfort to me oh my to know
[39:29] to see christ manifesting himself among
[39:32] the people if we never saw it if it was
[39:34] just word only and we never saw the
[39:36] manifestation we we would wonder what's
[39:39] taking place but now we see the
[39:41] manifestation bio the word doing exactly
[39:44] what he promised he would do
[39:46] it's a great comfort to us to know
[39:48] that there's a there's a manifestation
[39:50] of christ at the end time the bride is
[39:53] what god says it would be
[39:55] she would be
[39:58] i want to leave you with this tonight
[39:59] musicians go ahead and come
[40:06] you ever had somebody you felt safe with
[40:10] what i mean by that is you just felt
[40:11] like you could say anything
[40:14] you didn't have to guard your words
[40:16] but the joke there's not very many
[40:17] people like that is there
[40:21] you think about it
[40:23] you just feel like you could you could
[40:25] bear your soul and it would never go any
[40:27] farther
[40:29] it just stay right there
[40:32] you wouldn't be judged
[40:34] in a you wouldn't be accused
[40:38] and i know some of you wish you had a
[40:39] person like that a friend like that
[40:42] but that's what the holy spirit is
[40:46] there's a writer
[40:48] i don't know what led me to literature
[40:49] but i believe that god actually speaks
[40:52] through literature he speaks through art
[40:54] and music but the branham said
[40:55] sometimes we think of that as only
[40:57] christian art and christian music but
[40:58] sometimes god expresses himself in
[41:01] in ways that even people that are not
[41:03] saved
[41:04] but a writer put this
[41:06] like this in a children's book
[41:08] listen to these words he said oh
[41:10] there's a it was a lady that wrote this
[41:14] and she said oh the comfort
[41:16] the inexpressible comfort of feeling
[41:18] safe with a person
[41:21] having neither to weigh thoughts
[41:24] nor measure words
[41:26] but pouring them all out
[41:28] just as they are
[41:30] chaff and grain together
[41:32] certain that a faithful hand will take
[41:35] and sift them
[41:37] keep what is worth keeping
[41:39] and with a breath of kindness
[41:42] blow the rest away
[41:46] every one of us want a friend like that
[41:47] don't we
[41:49] you that kind of comfort
[41:52] i think we ought to strive for that
[41:53] ourselves
[41:54] to be like that to be that kind of a
[41:56] friend
[41:57] but we have
[41:59] that kind of
[42:00] friend the one standing by you knows
[42:04] every one of your faults
[42:08] and he hears all your words
[42:10] he hears when you
[42:12] say things you don't mean
[42:15] sometimes we do that
[42:17] he hears when you
[42:18] pray for revenge when when you know you
[42:21] shouldn't
[42:23] when someone treats you badly and
[42:25] you get in a bad you have a bad attitude
[42:27] about it he he hears that he knows that
[42:30] but he weighs the thoughts
[42:33] you pour them out to him
[42:35] oh my there's somebody you could talk to
[42:37] tonight
[42:38] oh
[42:39] there's somebody i think we need to
[42:41] really get back in touch with our prayer
[42:42] lives maybe that's why colbert has
[42:43] happened the way it does so we could get
[42:45] back in touch with our prayer lives
[42:47] there's there's somebody you can talk to
[42:48] a person
[42:50] a real person you can talk to that you
[42:52] feel you can feel safe with
[42:55] that you can pour out
[42:57] all of your thoughts
[42:59] the chaff and the grain together and
[43:02] that faithful hand will sift them out
[43:05] keep what is worth keeping
[43:08] with the breath of kindness blow
[43:10] the rest away you can rest assured
[43:14] he doesn't accuse you of one thing that
[43:16] you do
[43:18] he sees everything you do
[43:20] and he accuses you for none of it
[43:24] oh my aren't you glad to have a friend
[43:26] like that
[43:27] let's bow our heads together
[43:43] as i said i don't know how to weigh
[43:45] how to measure the value of what you've
[43:47] been through but
[43:49] i do know somebody who does
[43:52] he knows exactly what it means
[43:57] he knows how to deal with your heart in
[43:59] the moment
[44:01] how to break you down
[44:03] how to build you back up
[44:06] like i said i have to be careful with my
[44:07] words because i realize i can tear down
[44:11] and if i tear down i need to know that
[44:12] it's going to be built back in the right
[44:14] way
[44:15] so you have to be word careful with
[44:16] words that tear down
[44:19] but you've got one standing by you today
[44:23] he's on the defense team
[44:25] he's not there as an accuser
[44:28] i see people they get the wrong idea of
[44:30] the holy ghost they they keep coming
[44:32] back and back and back because they feel
[44:33] condemned all the time no the holy ghost
[44:35] is somebody that's on your side
[44:38] yes he'll convict you of sin but it's
[44:40] because he's on your side he'll steer
[44:42] you away
[44:44] from the things that would lead you down
[44:45] the wrong path
[44:48] it'll cause a preacher to preach
[44:49] something maybe that's hard sometimes
[44:51] but it's because he loves you
[44:54] you can see his hand in it he's leading
[44:56] you
[44:57] he's comforting you
[44:59] he's guiding you
[45:00] into all truth
[45:02] someday you're going to know even as
[45:04] you're known but while we're here
[45:06] if we're walking through the valley of
[45:08] the shadow of death
[45:09] we can know that he's there
[45:12] [Music]
[45:14] i always want to be there for you
[45:16] if anything this covert has taught us
[45:18] we're not always going to be able to be
[45:20] there for the people we want to be there
[45:21] for
[45:25] and that's just life that's just the way
[45:27] it is
[45:29] i've not always been there for my family
[45:31] like i want to be but i know one who is
[45:33] always there
[45:36] if i'm not if i'm caught in the wrong
[45:37] position in the wrong place
[45:39] at the wrong time and unable
[45:42] to care in the way that i should maybe
[45:43] with a bad attitude or something like
[45:45] that but i know that the holy spirit
[45:48] that lives inside of you is able to come
[45:50] and comfort you
[45:52] won't you lean on him tonight won't you
[45:54] just lean on him
[45:56] just just
[45:57] let him weigh your thoughts in your let
[45:59] pour out your heart to him
[46:01] don't don't think badly of other people
[46:04] because they don't understand but just
[46:06] just pour out your heart truth and lord
[46:07] i know you understand i know you get it
[46:10] no one else may but i know you do
[46:14] heavenly father
[46:16] we love you tonight we thank you for
[46:18] your comforting peace
[46:20] thank you for your comforting presence

[46:25] lord that comes to us
[46:27] lord you remind us of it just in that
[46:28] hour of our darkness
[46:31] in the hour when
[46:33] when maybe we were just about to give up
[46:36] we just thought nobody loved us
[46:39] and then we just see you working things
[46:40] out for us for our good
[46:44] or we thank you for that lord
[46:46] maybe we'll never know why we go through
[46:47] some of the things that we do
[46:49] but we know that you're one that stands
[46:51] with us
[46:52] help these people lord
[46:54] help them to see beyond their pastor
[46:56] beyond the ministry
[46:58] lord though we are instruments used by
[47:00] you many times used by you but sometimes
[47:02] lord we get in the flesh

[47:07] to say or the right things to do
